*The Collected Annotations on the Zhuangzi* (Qing Dynasty) by Guo Qingfan
*Preface and Catalogue of the Classic Exegetical Writings* by Lu Deming of the Tang Dynasty

**Zhuangzi**
The Zhuangzi is attributed to Zhuang Zhou, a native of Meng County in the state of Liang. His surname was Zhuang, his given name Zhou (Sima Qian records his courtesy name as Zixiu). During the Warring States period, he served as an officer of the Lacquer Garden and was a contemporary of King Hui of Wei, King Xuan of Qi, and King Wei of Chu (Li Yi states he was a contemporary of King Min of Qi). The states of Qi and Chu once offered him the position of prime minister, but he declined. While others of his time valued rhetorical persuasion, Zhuangzi alone held his pursuits in lofty esteem, living with ease and contentment. Following the principles of the Laozi, he composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters, advocating freedom through natural spontaneity and the equality of all things. His writings are largely allegorical, ultimately converging upon principle, and cannot be rigidly interpreted by their surface meaning. Yet Zhuangzi’s vast talent and world-renowned eloquence, with its profound and florid diction—often appearing paradoxical—left his grand vision insufficiently expounded. Later hands added interpolations, gradually obscuring the original text. Thus, Guo Xiang (Zixuan) remarked: *“Those of limited talent recklessly inserted strange theories—such as the opening sections of ‘Yan Yi’ and ‘Yi Xiu,’ or the chapters ‘Wei Yan,’ ‘You Fu,’ and ‘Zi Xu’—amounting to roughly three-tenths of the text, all cunningly interwoven.”*

The *Han shu*’s *Yiwen zhi* records fifty-two chapters of the *Zhuangzi*, corresponding to the editions annotated by Sima Biao and Meng Shi. Its language is often fantastical, at times resembling the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* or divination manuals, leading commentators to exercise subjective judgment in their selections. The “Inner Chapters” are universally acknowledged by all schools, while the remainder may include “Outer” sections but lack “Miscellaneous” ones. Only Guo Xiang’s annotations truly align with Zhuangzi’s intent, which is why they are prized by later generations. Xu Xianmin and Li Hongfan both produced phonetic glosses based on Guo’s edition, and this work likewise adopts Guo’s version as its foundation.

Cui Zhuan’s commentary comprises ten fascicles and twenty-seven chapters (Cui was a native of Qinghe and served as Gentleman-Consultant during the Jin Dynasty). It includes seven “Inner Chapters” and twenty “Outer Chapters.”

Xiang Xiu’s annotations comprise twenty fascicles and twenty-six chapters (alternatively recorded as twenty-seven or twenty-eight chapters, also lacking “Miscellaneous” chapters; phonetic glosses in three fascicles).

Sima Biao’s annotations comprise twenty-one fascicles and fifty-two chapters (styled Shaotong, a native of Henei, who served as Gentleman-Secretary during the Jin Dynasty; seven “Inner Chapters,” twenty-eight “Outer Chapters,” fourteen “Miscellaneous Chapters,” and three chapters of exegesis; phonetic glosses in three fascicles).

Guo Xiang’s annotations comprise thirty-three fascicles and thirty-three chapters (styled Zixuan, a native of Henei, who served as Registrar to the Grand Mentor during the Jin Dynasty; seven “Inner Chapters,” fifteen “Outer Chapters,” and eleven “Miscellaneous Chapters”; phonetic glosses in three fascicles).

Li Yi’s collected explanations comprise thirty fascicles and thirty chapters (styled Jingzhen, a native of Xiangcheng in Yingchuan, who served as Assistant to the Chancellor during the Jin Dynasty and styled himself Master of the Mysterious Dao; alternatively recorded as thirty-five chapters, with phonetic glosses in one fascicle).

The Meng lineage’s annotations comprise eighteen fascicles and fifty-two chapters (the annotator’s identity remains undetermined).

Wang Shu’s *Exegeses* comprise three fascicles. (Styled Mu[gap], a native of Langye, a recluse of the Song Dynasty. Also recorded as *Annotations*.)

Li Gui’s *Phonetic Glosses* comprise one fascicle.
Xu Miao’s *Phonetic Glosses* comprise three fascicles.

**Preface to the *Zhuangzi* by Cheng Xuanying**

**Preface to the *Zhuangzi***
Composed by Cheng Xuanying, Dharma Master of Xihua in the Tang Dynasty

The *Zhuangzi* serves to expound the profound roots of the Dao and virtue, to elucidate the wondrous purport of the profound mystery, to unfold the serenity of non-action, and to illuminate the obscure darkness of solitary transformation. It subdues the nine schools and encompasses the hundred masters, truly the supreme teaching within the realm and the subtle words beyond forms.

The author, surnamed Zhuang, named Zhou, styled Zixiu, was born in Meng County of Suiyang in the state of Song. He studied under Master Chang Sang and was posthumously titled the Perfected One of Nanhua.

At the beginning of the Warring States period, during the decline of the Zhou Dynasty, he lamented the meager karma of sentient beings and grieved the decay of the Dao and virtue. Thus, with fervent resolve, he composed this treatise.

Its words are vast and expansive; its purport, deep and far-reaching. Not within the hearing of lesser scholars, how could shallow minds fathom it?

The term *zi* ("Master") is an honorific for one of virtue, as the ancients referred to their teachers as *zi*. It may also denote the title of this work—not merely the collective name for the three Inner Chapters, but the common designation for all schools.

The term *Inner Chapters* signifies their distinction from the Outer, with *pian* ("chapters") referring to bound bamboo slips. In antiquity, bamboo was cured to make slips, bound with leather thongs. Bound slips formed chapters, much as connected sheets form scrolls today. Thus, Yuan Kai stated: "Great matters were recorded on *ce* (bamboo tablets), while minor ones were noted on *jian* (wooden slips)." The Inner Chapters discourse on the fundamental principles, while the Outer Chapters recount events and traces. Though events may be manifest, they are not understood without principle; though principle is subtle, it is not revealed without events. To first clarify the wondrous principle, the Inner Chapters are placed first.

As the principles in the Inner Chapters are profound, each chapter bears a distinct title outside the text. Guo Xiang further appended annotations beneath these titles, as seen in *Free and Easy Wandering* and *The Equality of Things*. From the Outer Chapters onward, titles are taken from the first two characters of each chapter, such as *Webbed Toes* and *Horses’ Hooves*.

Regarding *Free and Easy Wandering*, interpretations have varied across the ages. Here, I broadly outline the essentials in three explanations:

First, Gu Tongbai stated: "*Xiao* means to dissolve; *yao* means distant. Dissolving all encumbrances of action and perceiving afar the principle of non-action—wandering thus is called *xiaoyaoyou*."

Second, Zhi Daolin stated: "Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them, one is thus free and unbound by them. Mysterious resonance is swift without haste, hence distant yet capable of all. Wandering the world thus is called *xiaoyaoyou*."

Third, Mu Ye stated: "*Xiaoyao* is the name for unrestrained self-contentment. With perfect virtue inwardly full, one is ever at ease; responding to things with forgetfulness, where does one not penetrate? Wandering the world thus is called *xiaoyaoyou*."

The Inner Chapters clarify the fundamental principles; the Outer Chapters recount events and traces; the Miscellaneous Chapters intermingle principles and events.

Though the Inner Chapters elucidate fundamental principles, they are not without accounts of events; though the Outer Chapters recount events and traces, they abound in subtle principles. The division into chapters is merely based on what each emphasizes.

The reason *Xiaoyaoyou* stands as the first chapter is this: it speaks of those who have attained the Dao—whose wisdom and virtue are luminous and keen, whose every achievement is fitting, and who wander freely in encounter with all things. Thus, it names the chapter after *xiaoyaoyou*. The sagely person without dependencies reflects circumstances like a mirror, having mastered the two wisdoms of provisional and ultimate truth. Therefore, they can bring all realms into great harmony, and so *Qiwulun* follows. Having pointed to the hooves and the heavens, merging the myriad things as one, with a mind serene and still, one can thereby nurture life and safeguard well-being—thus *Yangshengzhu* follows. Having forgotten both good and evil, with both realm and wisdom perfected, one can adapt to change and follow transformation, thereby navigating the human world—thus *Renjianshi* follows. With inner virtue complete, one can extend it outwardly to engage with things, rising and falling with them while inwardly and outwardly merging in profound resonance—thus *Dechongfu* follows. Like still water or a flowing mirror, engaging with things without attachment, forgetting both virtue and form, one reaches the ultimate union of inner and outer—thereby able to shape and perfect all beings, and so *Dazongshi* follows. The true sages of antiquity, knowing both Heaven and humanity, shared the same work as creation itself, responding while remaining quiescent. Thus, they could guide and govern all beings—hence *Yingdiwang* follows. The chapters from *Pianmu* onward all take their titles from the first two characters of each, without further significance, and so their order is not discussed here.

Since ancient times, reclusive scholars of the Jin and Han dynasties have all studied and interpreted these texts. Though their commentaries leave no room for criticism, filled with elegant phrasing, they all delve into hidden meanings. I, Cheng Xuanying, though unworthy and dull, began my study in youth and have devoted thirty years to deep reflection. Following Guo Xiang’s commentary on the thirty chapters, I have composed this exegesis, totaling thirty fascicles. Though my words may be coarse and my insights clumsy, they at least trace the contours of the text’s intent. I dare not presume to leave this for later generations; it merely serves to record what I might otherwise forget.

**[Collation Note]** (1) The character "蹄" is erroneously interpolated in the Song edition; following the meaning of *The Equality of Things and Opinions* ("Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse"), it has been deleted.

**Preface to the *Zhuangzi***

The *Zhuangzi* may be said to have grasped the root. Thus, it never conceals its unbridled words, though they meet with no consensus, they alone resonate.

To respond without convergence is to be correct yet useless; words untethered to things and affairs, though lofty, remain unenacted. Compared to those who abide in stillness, unmoving, and rise only when compelled, there is indeed a distinction—this may be called knowing the heart without intent.

When the heart is without contrivance, it responds to stimuli as they arise, adapting to the moment, speaking only with restraint. Thus, it embodies transformation, flowing through the ages and obscuring things—how could it ever contrive opposition, encountering the singular, and wander in discourse beyond the bounds of convention? This is why it stands unorthodox yet crowns the hundred schools.

Though Zhuangzi himself may not have fully embodied it, his words attain perfection. They penetrate the unity of heaven and earth, order the natures of the myriad things, comprehend the changes of life and death, and illuminate the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingship. Above, they know the Creator as no-thing; below, they know things as self-created.

His words are vast and expansive, his purport profound and wondrous. The utmost Dao fuses subtlety with elegance; serene and unconstrained, it is free yet not arrogant. Thus it is said: unaware of where propriety leads, one acts wildly yet treads the great square; chewing contentedly, one rejoices in tranquility, drumming one’s belly and wandering in boundless obscurity.

The perfected person (or humane one) reaches the extremity of no-partiality; filial piety and compassion culminate in mutual forgetting. Ritual and music revert to innate ability; loyalty and trust emanate from celestial radiance. Employing this radiance, one’s uncarved simplicity naturally forms. Thus, the sacred vessel transforms alone in the realm of profound obscurity, its source and flow deep and enduring.

Where its long waves surge, where its lofty winds fan, it harmonizes with the fittingness of things and accords with the people’s wishes. It broadens the narrow, unties the entangled, and though the work of liberation remains undone, arrogance and ostentation scatter of themselves.

Thus, reading his book, one feels transcendent, as if already sufficient—traversing Kunlun, crossing the great void, and wandering the courts of the indistinct and fleeting. Even the greedy and restless, if they but briefly grasp its lingering fragrance, savor its overflowing currents, and dimly perceive its echoes and shadows, may yet feel the joy of forgetting form and attaining self-contentment. How much more so for those who plumb its distant depths and delight in eternal years!

Thus it extends, remote and pure, departing from the dust and returning to the ultimate obscurity.

1. "Free and Easy Wandering" (First)

*[1] Exegetical Record*
The term *inner* (内) is established in contrast to *outer*. The *Shuowen* states: "A *pian* (篇) is a book." The character is formed from *bamboo* (竹); the variant with *grass* (艹) refers to a plant name and is incorrect.

*[2] Commentary*
Though small and great differ, when each roams in the field of self-contentment, things follow their nature, affairs match their capacities, and each attains its proper place—then "free and easy wandering" is one and the same. How could there be room for victory or defeat among them?

◎ Guo Qingfan’s note: Liu Yiqing’s *A New Account of the Tales of the World*, in the section on literature, states: "The 'Free and Easy Wandering' chapter of the *Zhuangzi* was long considered difficult; even eminent scholars could only ponder and savor it without extracting principles beyond those of Guo Xiang and Xiang Xiu. When Zhi Daolin was at White Horse Monastery, he conversed with Attendant Censor Feng and touched upon 'free and easy wandering.' Zhi boldly established a new principle beyond the two masters and set forth a distinctive interpretation outside the views of all the worthies. These were matters even the most eminent scholars had failed to fathom, and later generations adopted Zhi’s reasoning."

Liu Xiaobiao’s commentary records the "free and easy wandering" theories of Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang: "The great Peng soars ninety thousand *li*, while the quail rises from the elm or sandalwood—though small and great differ, each follows its nature. If it attains its proper place, then 'free and easy wandering' is one and the same. Yet the myriad things all rely on something to depend upon; only when they obtain what they depend on can they achieve 'free and easy wandering.' Only the sage merges with things and follows the great transformations, thus able to be without dependence and always pervade. Not only does he pervade himself, but he also ensures that those who depend on something do not lose what they depend on. If they do not lose it, then they are one with the great pervasion."

Zhi’s *Treatise on Free and Easy Wandering* states: "'Free and easy wandering' elucidates the mind of the perfected person. Zhuangzi expounded the great Dao and lodged his meaning in the Peng and the quail. The Peng, with its vast path of sustenance, loses its ease in external matters; the quail, laughing at the distant from its proximity, harbors self-conceit within. The perfected person rides the celestial norm and roams joyfully, wandering boundlessly in freedom. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by things, he is so distant that nothing can grasp him. With mysterious responsiveness that does not act, he is not swift yet moves swiftly—thus he is 'free and easy' and nothing is not fitting. If one has desires and attains what suffices, being content with what suffices, one may feel a joy akin to natural spontaneity—like the hungry who eat their fill or the thirsty who drink their fill. Yet how could they forget the steamed grain or abandon the goblet of fine wine? If it is not supreme sufficiency, how can it be called 'free and easy wandering'?" This is what the annotations of Xiang and Guo did not fully exhaust.

*Exegetical Record*
*Xiao* (逍) is pronounced *xiao* (销), also written as *xiao* (消).
*Yao* (遥) is read as written, also written as *yao* (摇).

◎ Guo Qingfan’s note: The characters *xiaoyao* (逍遥) are not included in the *Shuowen*; the form *xiaoyao* (消摇) is correct. The *Rites of Zhou*’s *Tan Gong* reads *xiaoyao* (消摇) at the gate; the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s "Biography of Sima Xiangru" reads *xiaoyao* (消摇) in the manner of a sheep; the *Jingshan* commentary on the *Tai Xuan Jing* reads, "Though one may wish to *xiaoyao* (消摇), Heaven does not permit it here"; the Han dynasty *Kaimu Stone Inscription* reads, "The radiance of culture shines with *xiaoyao* (消摇)"; the *Wen Xuan*’s "Nine Arguments" by Song Yu reads, "I idly *xiaoyao* (消摇) and wander"; the *Book of Later Han*’s "Biography of Prince Cang of Dongping" reads *xiaoyao* (消摇) and *xiangyang* (相羊). In all these cases, the character is written with *water* (氵) as *xiao* (消) and with *hand* (扌) as *yao* (摇).

The Tang dynasty monk Zhanran’s *Fuhang Zhiguan* quotes Wang Maoye: "*Xiaoyao* (消摇) means the sense of harmonious ease and leisure. When the supreme principle is inwardly sufficient, there is no time when one is not at ease; when the mind abides in responsiveness to things, there is nowhere one does not pervade. Roaming the world with this, it is called *xiaoyao* (消摇)." It also states: "The principle has no hidden depths—it is *xiao* (消) and fitting; form has no great or small—it is *yao* (摇) and pervading. Thus it is called *xiaoyao* (消摇)." This explanation of *xiaoyao* surpasses those of the Confucians.

*You* (游) is read as written, also written as *you* (遊).
"*Xiaoyaoyou* (逍遥游)" is the chapter title, its meaning taken from leisurely roaming without constraint, delighting in self-contentment.

◎ Guo Qingfan’s note: My late father, the Vice Minister, said: "In the 'World' chapter, Zhuangzi himself states that his Daoist arts are replete and cannot be stopped—above, he roams with the Creator."

The opening chapter is titled *Xiaoyaoyou* ("Free and Easy Wandering"), wherein Zhuangzi employs his boundless, unbounded words to express his own analogy.

The commentary states that though small and large differ, their *xiaoyao* is one—this seems to miss Zhuangzi’s intent.

◎ Another note: The *Wen Xuan* annotation to Pan Anren’s *Qiuxing Fu* cites Sima Biao: "To speak of *xiaoyao* and non-action is to say one can wander the great Dao." This is omitted in the *Shiwen*.

*"Fu xiao da"* (夫小大) is pronounced *fu* (音符).
*"Zhi chang"* (之场) is read *zhi liang* (直良反).
*"Shi cheng"* (事称) is read *chi zheng* (尺证反).
*"Ge dang"* (各当) is read *ding lang* (丁浪反).
*"Qi fen"* (其分) is read *fu wen* (符问反).

【Collation Notes】
(1) Supplemented from the Tongzhi Hall edition of the *Jingdian Shiwen*.
(2) In the Song edition of Zhao Jianyi, *ge* (各) is written as *ming* (名).

In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun is so vast that no one knows how many thousands of *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The Peng’s back is so immense that no one knows how many thousands of *li* it stretches; when it rises in flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the seas surge, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.

【Annotation】
The darkness (*ming*) is like the sea, taking its vast and boundless expanse, hence it is called *ming*. Dongfang Shuo’s *Shizhou Ji* states: "The *ming* sea has no wind, yet its waves rise a hundred *zhang*." Within this vast sea dwells this great fish, illustrating the spontaneity of things’ natures—thus it begins the chapter. The *Xuan Zhong Ji* records: "In the east there is a great fish; a traveler takes a day to pass its head and seven days to pass its tail. When it spawns for three days, the azure sea turns red." Thus we know great things arise in great places—how could this be limited to the Northern Darkness alone?

【Pronunciation and Exegesis】
*"Bei Ming"* (北冥) is also written as *ming* (溟), pronounced *mi jing* (觅经反), meaning the Northern Sea. Ji Kang says: "It takes its name from its vast and boundless expanse." Emperor Jianwen of Liang states: "Its depths are fathomless, hence it is called *ming*." Dongfang Shuo’s *Shizhou Ji* says: "Waters of black hue are called the *ming* sea, where waves rise a hundred *zhang* without wind."

◎ Guo Qingfan’s note: Hui Lin’s *Yiqie Jing Yinyi*, in the second fascicle of the *Mahāyāna Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra*, cites Sima [Biao]: "*Ming* refers to the northern and southern poles, far from the sun and moon, hence the name *ming*." This is omitted in the *Shiwen*.

*"Kun"* (鲲) is pronounced *kun* (徐音昆) by Xu, and *hou wen* (李侯温反) by Li—it is the name of a great fish. Cui Zan says: "*Kun* should be *jing* (鲸)," and Emperor Jianwen concurs.

◎ Guo Qingfan’s note: Fang Yizhi states: "*Kun* originally names small fish, but Zhuangzi uses it for a great fish—his explanation is correct." The *Erya*’s *Shi Yu* glosses *kun* as "fish roe." All fish roe are called *kun*; the *Lu Yu*’s "Fish Prohibitions" mentions *kun* and *er*, with Wei Zhao’s note: "*Kun* is fish roe." Zhang Heng’s *Xijing Fu* speaks of "gathering *kun* and *er*," with Xue Zong’s note: "*Kun* is fish roe." The *Shuowen* lacks a *kun* seal. Duan Yucai says: "Fish roe before hatching are called *kun*. *Kun* is the *luan* (卵) character; Xu Shen writes it as □, pronounced in ancient times like *guan* or *kun*. The *Liji*’s *Neize* mentions 'soaked fish roe sauce,' with Zheng [Xuan] reading *luan* as *kun*. All unhatched are called *luan*; hatched are called *zi*. *Kun* is fish roe, hence Xu Shen subsumes it under □." Zhuangzi calling an immense fish *kun* is a parable of *qiwu* ("equalizing things"), what is meant by "indulging in the boundless to suit oneself." The *Shiwen* cites Li Yi: "*Kun* is the name of a great fish," while Cui Zan and Emperor Jianwen say it should be *jing*—both are mistaken.

*"Qi ji"* (其几) is read *ju qi* (居岂反), the same below.

【Annotation】
As for the reality of Peng and Kun, I do not know it in detail. Zhuangzi’s great intent lies in *xiaoyao*, wandering freely, non-action, and self-contentment—thus he exhausts the extremes of small and large to clarify the fittingness of one’s allotted nature. Those of far-reaching vision should grasp its essential convergence and overlook its incidental expressions; there is no need to quibble over every detail with the living. If it does not harm the grand purport, all may be disregarded.

【Exegesis】
Now, the four seasons race like the wind, and the three luminaries roll like lightning—thus one bears mountains and ridges to abandon the old, and raises boats and valleys to hasten toward the new. Therefore, the transformation of fish into bird is meant to illustrate the grand principle of change.

【Annotation to *Shiwen*】
*Peng* (鹏): *Budeng* (步登) reflex.
Xu reads it as *peng* (朋).
Guo reads it as *fudeng* (甫登) reflex.
Cui reads it as *feng* (凤), saying: "Peng is the ancient form of the character *feng* (凤), not the *feng* that comes bearing auspicious omens."
The *Shuowen* states: "*Peng* (朋) and *peng* (鹏) are both ancient forms of *feng* (凤)." The character *peng* (朋) depicts birds in formation. When the *feng* takes flight, flocks of birds follow in the tens of thousands—hence the character *peng* (朋) was later used for "faction" or "clique."
The *Zilin* states: "*Peng* (鹏) means faction or clique; in antiquity, it was used as the character *feng* (凤)."
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The original text read *yipeng* (以鹏); now, following the sense, it has been emended to *yipeng* (以朋).
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Guangchuan Shu Ba* and *Baohuo Zhong Ming*, as well as *Tongya* 45, both cite Sima as saying: "*Peng* (鹏) is *feng* (凤)." This is omitted in the *Shiwen*.
*Fuzhuang* (夫庄): read as *fu* (符).

The openings of all verses are identical.
*Xingfen* reads *fu* (符), *wen* (问) reversed; the same applies below.
*Daguan* reads *gu* (古), *luan* (乱) reversed.
*Yiyao* reads *yi* (一), *yao* (遥) reversed.

[Commentary 3] [Sub-commentary]
The fish is described in terms of its vastness to show that its head and tail are beyond knowing; the bird is spoken of in terms of its back to likewise suggest that its length is unfathomable. Thus the following text states, "None have known its full extent."
With wings outstretched in fury, feathers bristling in agitation, it prepares to ride the wind and strike the waters. Then, cutting through the clouds, bearing the azure sky upon its back, it soars and wheels, brushing the heavens, casting its shade and spreading its shadow like the drifting clouds that descend from the edge of the sky.

[Exegesis]
*Sima Biao* says: "Like clouds hanging at the edge of the sky."
*Cui* says: "*Chui* (垂) means 'edge'; its vastness is like a cloud covering one side of the sky."

[Commentary 4] [Annotation]
Only the dark sea suffices to turn its body; only ninety thousand *li* suffice to bear its wings. Is this mere fondness for the marvelous? It is simply that great things must arise from great places, and great places must give rise to such great things—this is the natural principle, not to be feared as a loss. Why then trouble the heart over such matters?

[Sub-commentary]
*Yun* (运) means "to turn." *Shi* (是) is a demonstrative. This *peng* bird is so massive that without turning in the sea, it cannot ascend; all this is inevitable, not a matter of preference. Moreover, as its form transforms, its nature changes with it. Once a fish, it swam in the Northern Sea; now a bird, it soars toward the Southern Darkness. Though its rise and fall differ in nature, its freedom remains the same—just as life and death, gathering and dispersal, are but encounters with circumstances, and the myriad transformations have never ceased to be the self. The transformation from fish to bird, journeying from north to south, signifies this: the bird is a creature of the void, and the south is the direction of the morning star; the fish is a creature of stagnation, and the north is the realm of darkness. This illustrates turning toward light and away from darkness, abandoning stagnation to seek progress—hence the use of the southern bird and northern fish to point the way of the Dao. The great sea and vast rivers originate from creation, not human effort, and so are called the "Heavenly Pool."

[Exegesis]
*Haijun* (海运): *Sima* says: "*Yun* (运) means 'to turn.'"
*Xiang Xiu* says: "Without the sea, it cannot move, hence 'sea-turning.'"
*Jianwen* says: "*Yun* (运) means 'to shift.'"
◎ *Qingfan* notes: The *Yupian* defines *yun* (运) as "to move." The *Huntian Yi* states: "The heavens move like a wheel's hub," meaning the heavens' motion is ceaseless. Here, *yun* should also be glossed as "to move." *Zhuangzi* speaks of the *peng* moving ceaselessly over the sea, then shifting to the Heavenly Pool to rest. (The *Shuowen* defines *xi* (徙) as "to move"; *Duan*’s commentary: "To go and stop, then finally stop, is to shift one's place.") The following text, citing the *Qi Xie* on the sixth-month rest, confirms this. *Guo*’s interpretation—"only the dark sea suffices to turn its body"—and the exegesis citing *Sima* and *Xiang Xiu* are both incorrect.
*Qi hao* (岂好): *hu* (呼), *bao* (报) reversed; the same applies below.
*Dachu* (大处): *chang* (昌), *lü* (虑) reversed; the same applies below.
*He cuo* (何厝): *qi* (七), *gu* (故) reversed. Originally written as *cuo* (措).
◎ *Lu Wenchang* says: According to the *Shuowen*, *cuo* (厝) means "whetstone," while *cuo* (措) means "to place"; the two are often conflated in common usage. Here, *Zhuangzi*’s annotation uses *cuo* (措), which aligns with the *Shuowen*.
[Collation]
(1) The ancients often mixed these usages; henceforth, they are distinguished by meaning and not repeated.
(2) Emended following the *Wenxuan*.

The *Qi Xie* is a record of anomalies. It states: "When the roc migrates to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*, and departs only after a six-month rest. The *ye ma*, the dust motes—all living things are blown about by one another’s breath. Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it simply so distant that it has no end? From above, the view below must appear the same.

◎ **Annotation**: A wing so vast cannot easily lift; thus, it must spiral on the whirlwind before ascending, and only after ninety thousand *li* can it fully sustain itself. With such wings, how could it suddenly take flight and descend after a few *ren*? All this is unavoidable, not a matter of preference.

◎ **Exegesis**: *Qi* is the surname, *Xie* the given name—a person’s name. It may also refer to a book’s title, as the state of Qi possessed such a work of *pai xie* (jesting and harmonious) records. *Zhi* means "to record"; *ji*, "to strike"; *tuan*, "to spiral"; *fu yao*, "whirlwind." The book attributed to Qi Xie records many strange and marvelous events, which Zhuangzi cites as evidence to affirm the truth of his own words. When the great roc sets out for the Southern Abyss, it cannot take flight abruptly. Instead, it beats its wings, stirring the water for three thousand *li*, stumbling forward before finally lifting off. Then, twisting and turning, it stirs the wind with furious flapping, riding the currents upward in a spiral. After traversing ninety thousand *li* and half a year’s time, it arrives at last, composed and content, to rest. This is merely sufficient—how could it be a matter of choice?

◎ **Phonetic Glosses**:
*Qi Xie*: *hu jie* (户皆) reversed. Sima [Biao] and Cui [Yan] both say it is a person’s name. [Wang] Jianwen says it is a book.
◎ **Yu Yue** notes: Given that the text below reads, "Xie states," it is more fitting to take it as a person’s name. If it were a book’s title, it could not simply be called *Xie*.
*Zhi guai*: *Zhi* means "to record"; *guai*, "anomalies."
*Shui ji*: Cui [Yan] says: As it prepares to fly, it beats its wings, striking the water in a stumbling motion. *Liang* (踉): *liang* (亮). *Qiang* (跄): *qi liang* (七亮) reversed.
*Tuan*: *tu duan* (徒端) reversed. Sima [Biao] says: "to spiral upward." Also pronounced *bo*. Cui [Yan] says: "to flap its wings and spiral upward."
◎ **Lu Wenchang** notes: It should read "originally written as *bo* (搏), pronounced *bo*." In his gloss on *tuan zhi* (抟埴) in the *Kaogong Ji*, Lu [Deming] also gives *bo* as Liu’s pronunciation, failing to distinguish the characters—an error.
◎ **Qing Fan** notes: The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* (72) cites Sima [Biao]: "*Ji* means 'to move.'" This is omitted in the *Shiwen*. The *Wenxuan*’s *Jiang Wentong Zati Shi* annotation cites Sima: "*Tuan* means 'circular.' *Fu yao* is an upward-moving wind; circular flight ascending is like *fu yao*." The *Fan Yanlong Guyi Zeng Wang Zhongshu Shi* annotation cites Sima: "*Tuan* means 'circular.' Circular flight ascending is like *fu yao*." The *Zhang Jingyang Qiming* annotation, the *Taiping Yulan* (9 and 927), and the *Chuxue Ji* (1) all cite Sima: "*Fu yao* is an upward-moving wind." The citations vary slightly, differing somewhat from the *Shiwen*.
◎ **Further note**: The *Shuowen* defines *tuan* as "to make circular with the hands," anciently borrowed as *zhuan* (专). The *Hanshu Tianwen Zhi* reads: "When *qi* is low, it spreads; when *qi* of the masses is *tuan*..." Yan Shigu’s annotation: "*Tuan* means 'concentrated.'" The *Jiyun* defines *tuan* as "to monopolize" (with *shan* also carrying the sense of "concentration") and "to gather." *Tuan fu yao er shang* means "to concentrate the wind’s power and ascend." The *Shiwen*’s citations do not capture the meaning of *tuan*.
*Fu yao*: Xu [Shen] pronounces it *yao*—a wind’s name. Sima [Biao] says: "An upward-moving wind is called *fu yao*." The *Erya* says: "*Fu yao* is called *biao*." Guo Pu says: "A violent wind rising from below."
◎ **Lu Wenchang** notes: "From below upward" is inverted; corrected here according to the *Erya* annotation.
*Er shang*: *shi zhang* (时掌) reversed. Same as the annotation.
*Zi sheng*: *sheng* (升). Same below.

◎ **Annotation**: The great bird departs for half a year before resting at the Celestial Pond; the small bird flies for half a morning before alighting on the elm or sandalwood. Though their capacities differ, in following their nature, they are one.
◎ **Phonetic Glosses**:
*Qiang*: *qi yang* (七羊) reversed.
*Fang*: *fang* (方).
◎ **Jia Shifu** notes: "Departs with a six-month rest" means "riding the long wind," forming a parallel with the later phrase "if the season does not permit, it alights on the earth." Zhuangzi’s prose often cannot be interpreted strictly at the level of individual words.

◎ **Annotation**: All these are what the roc relies upon to fly. The "wild horses" are roving *qi*. *Erya* states: "Beyond the city lies the outskirts; beyond the outskirts, the pasture; beyond the pasture, the wilds." This speaks of the time of spring’s vitality, when yang *qi* stirs into motion. Gazing afar at the marshes and wetlands, one sees them surge like galloping horses—hence the name "wild horses." Dust is raised earth; the finest dust is called "motes." Between heaven and earth, the *qi* of living things breathes and stirs, mutually propelling one another to lift the roc aloft. Now, the four modes of birth teem in profusion, the myriad things differ in form and disposition, and their needs and dependencies vary. Thus the roc beats its wings that span the sky, riding the winds in freedom; the cicada spreads its wings of sudden ascent, darting to the elm or sandalwood in contentment. All follow their nature in movement, endowed by the workings of creation. They harbor no attachment to far or near, nor do they entertain thoughts of pride or arrogance. Those who embody this spirit—how could they speak of striving or emulation?

◎ **Phonetic Glosses**:
*Ye ma* (野马): Sima [Biao] says: "The roving *qi* in marshes during spring." Cui [Yuan] says: "The *qi* between heaven and earth surges like wild horses."
*Chen ai* (尘埃): Pronounced *āi*. Cui [Yuan] says: "The *qi* between heaven and earth billows thickly like rising dust."
*Xiang chui* (相吹): Pronounced as written. Cui [Yuan]’s version reads *chui* (炊).
◎ **Qingfan’s Note**: The characters *chui* (吹, "blow") and *chui* (炊, "steam") were interchangeable in antiquity. *Jiyun* states: "*Chui* (炊) means rising through cumulative motion." *Xunzi*’s "Zhongni" chapter reads, "can be steamed and □," while this book’s "Zai You" chapter reads, "in ease and nonaction, the myriad things steam and accumulate"—both gloss *chui* (炊) as interchangeable with *chui* (吹).
◎ **Further Note**: Master Zhuang first states that the roc’s flight and rest each accord with its nature, then elaborates that "wild horses" and "motes" are all living things propelled by mutual breath—an analogy for the roc’s pure adherence to spontaneity, just as "wild horses" and "motes" rise through cumulative motion without deliberate intent. Guo [Xiang]’s interpretation of "what the roc relies upon to fly" appears mistaken.
*Suo feng* (所冯): Pronounced *pí bīng*. Also written as *凭*.
◎ **Lu Wenchang’s Note**: The present annotation uses *凭*; this has been corrected.

**[4] [Commentary]**
Now observing the deep blue of heaven, we cannot know whether this is truly heaven’s proper hue, or whether heaven is simply so distant as to be boundless. When the roc gazes down upon the earth from above, it appears no different from how man gazes up at heaven from below. Thus, it halts its plans to journey south, for the roc knows not the distance in *li*—it merely presses forward with what suffices to sustain its flight and departs.

**[Subcommentary]**
Gazing upward at the vault of heaven, one finds it vast and remote; the azure expanse stretches high and far, its measure beyond reckoning. How could this hazy blue truly be heaven’s proper color? Yet the roc, dwelling in the midst of heaven, and man, dwelling upon the earth below, see no difference in their perspectives—the roc’s downward gaze is no different from man’s upward gaze. If man cannot discern heaven’s true color, how could the roc know the earth’s distance? With strength sufficient to sustain itself, it reaches the Southern Darkness; the roc’s calculations extend no further than this.

Moreover, if the accumulation of water is not deep, it will lack the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the hall, and a mustard seed may serve as a boat; place a cup there, and it will run aground—water too shallow for a vessel so large. If the accumulation of wind is not deep, it will lack the strength to bear great wings. Thus, only at ninety thousand *li* does the wind lie beneath it, and only then can it ride the wind. With the azure sky at its back and nothing to obstruct its path, only then does it set its course for the south.

**[1] [Commentary]**
All this clarifies why the roc flies so high: because its wings are vast. A small substance requires no great support, so a great substance cannot rely on something small. Thus, principle has its ultimate limits, and things have their fixed bounds; each suffices for its task, and their success is one and the same. If one loses the essence of life by pursuing it beyond what is most fitting—if one’s affairs exceed one’s strength and one’s actions fail to accord with one’s nature—then even wings spanning the heavens cannot escape exhaustion, and even the most powerful flight cannot avoid distress.

**[Subcommentary]**
*且夫* (Moreover) is a borrowed phrase, a casual introductory term. *夫* (Now) marks the beginning, the opening thread of discourse.

Accumulation means gathering. Thickness means depth. A cup is a small vessel. A hollow is a sunken depression, referring to the low-lying ground of a hall or courtyard. A mustard seedling is a blade of grass. To be stuck means to adhere. This introduces the analogy.

If one overturns a cup of water into the sunken ground of a hall, and uses a blade of grass as a boat, it will float and drift without obstruction. But if one instead uses the cup as a boat, it is inherently impossible. Why? Because the water is shallow and the boat is large, it will stick to the ground and fail to move. Thus, a great boat requires deep water, while a tiny mustard seedling does not wait for a mighty current. If their sizes are fitting, then all things may roam freely.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*且夫*: pronounced *fú*.
*覆*: pronounced *fú*; Cui’s edition writes *杯* as *杯*.
*坳堂*: pronounced *yújiāo*, or *wūliǎo*; Li also reads *yījiǔ*. Cui says: "The path of the hall is called a hollow." Sima says: "To level the ground." Zhi Dun says: "It refers to ground with hollows and mounds."
*芥*: pronounced *jímài*; Xu reads *gǔmài*; another reading is *gǔxiá*. Li says: "A small blade of grass."
*则胶*: Xu and Li read *gǔxiào*; another reading is the standard pronunciation. Cui says: "To stick to the ground." Li says: "To adhere."
*称事*: pronounced *chìzhèng*. The same applies thereafter.

The *濟* is pronounced *zǐxì*, and in some editions written as *齊*, read as the standard pronunciation. The *之生* in some editions is also written as *主*. The *至當* is pronounced *dīnglàng*, and the same applies thereafter.

**[Section 2] [Exegesis]**
This is a combined metaphor. If the water is not deep and vast, then a great boat cannot be borne afloat; if the wind is not lofty and strong, the great wings cannot soar to the heavens. Thus, the small bird flies for half a morning, darting up to the elm and sandalwood; the roc of ninety thousand *li* rides the whirlwind that stirs beneath it.

**[Section 3] [Commentary]**
The reason it now plans to journey south is not that it delights in height or yearns for distance, but because without the accumulation of wind, obstruction and blockage cannot be overcome. This is the roc’s freedom of the Way.

**[Exegesis]**
*培* means "to bear." *夭* means "to break." *阏* means "to block." Initially relying on the whirlwind, it can ascend; bearing the weight of accumulated wind, it then takes flight. Thereafter, it bears the azure sky above and rides the spine of the wind below, soaring to the heavens in a single bound, journeying for six months before coming to rest. Nets and snares cannot reach it, arrows and traps do not encroach—how could calamities of breaking or blockage ever befall it? Truly, by relying on what is fitting and attaining its proper place, it roams freely to the Southern Sea—is this not fitting indeed!

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*而後乃今培*: pronounced *péi*, meaning "to bear." Xu reads *fúbēi*, and another pronunciation is *fúběi*. In some editions, it is written as *陪*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current edition writes "three" as "one," which is incorrect.
◎ Qing Fan’s case: Wang Niansun says: *培* is akin to *馮* (to ride). *馮* means "to mount." The wind is beneath the roc, hence it is said to "bear"; the roc is above the wind, hence it is said to "ride." Only after ninety thousand *li* is it above the wind, and only then can it ride the wind, thus it is said: "and only then does it now bear the wind." If *培* were glossed as "weight," it would have no connection to the preceding text. *馮* and *培* are phonetically close, hence their meanings are also related. In the *Book of Han*, Zhou’s enfeoffment was changed to *剻城侯*; Yan Shigu says: *剻* is pronounced *péi* in Lü Chen’s *Characters*. The *Annals of Chu and Han* writes it as *馮城侯*. *陪* and *馮* are phonetically close, which serves as evidence. (The ancient pronunciation of *馮* is in the *蒸* rhyme group, while *陪* is in the *之* group. The sounds of the *之* group are close to the *蒸* group, hence *陪* and *馮* are also phonetically close. The *Shuowen* says: *陪* means "to fill." Wang Yi’s commentary on the *Li Sao* says: *馮* means "to fill." Since *陪* and *馮* are phonetically close, both are glossed as "to fill." Wen Ying’s commentary on the *Book of Han*’s "Annals of Emperor Wen" says: *陪* means "to assist." Zhang Yan’s commentary on the *Tables of Officials and Nobles* says: *馮* means "to assist." The *Shuowen* says: *倗* means "to assist." *陪*, *馮*, and *倗* are phonetically close, hence all are glossed as "to assist." The *Shuowen* says: *倗* is from *人* with *朋* as its phonetic, read like *陪位*. ** is from *邑* with *崩* as its phonetic, read like *陪*. In the *Book of Han*, Wang Zun’s biography mentions the bandits of Mount Nan, *傰宗* et al.; Su Lin says: *傰* is pronounced *péng*. Jin Zhuo says: it is pronounced *bèi*. In the *Mozi*, the *Shangxian* chapter says: "In defending a city, one must *倍畔*"; the *Feiming* chapter writes *倍* as *崩*. These are all examples of this.)
Now, according to the *Shuowen*: *培* means "to augment." *培風* means using the wind to augment the strength of the great wings, aiding their high flight. Master Lu’s gloss of "weight" is unclear; Wang’s interpretation is more fitting.
*背負青天*: One reading connects *背* to the preceding sentence.
*夭*: pronounced *yúbiǎo*. Sima says: "to break."
*阏*: Xu reads *yúgé*, and another pronunciation is *yè*. Sima says: "to stop." Li says: "to block."
◎ Qing Fan’s case: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Liu Xiaobiao’s *Bianming Lun* cites Sima as saying: *夭* means "to break"; *阏* means "to stop." This is to say, there is nothing that breaks or stops it from passing through. This is more detailed than the citation in the *Exegetical Notes*.

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) *生* is amended according to the *Exegetical Notes* and the *Shide Tang* edition.
(2) *是* is supplied according to Liu Wendian’s *Supplemented and Corrected Edition*.
(3) Amended according to the exegesis below: "the small bird darts up to the elm and sandalwood."
(4) ** is amended according to the *Book of Han*.

The cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: "We dart up and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood, and sometimes fail to reach them, falling to the ground—what need is there to journey ninety thousand *li* to the south?" Those who travel to the nearby wilderness carry three meals and return with their bellies still full; those who journey a hundred *li* must pound grain for provisions the night before.

Those who journey a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months.

How little do these two creatures know!

**[Annotation]**
If one is content with their nature, then even the great Peng has no cause to esteem itself above the small bird, nor does the small bird envy the celestial pond, for its glory and desires are already fulfilled. Thus, though great and small differ, their freedom is one and the same.

**[Exegesis]**
The *tiao* is the cicada, which emerges in the seventh or eighth month, its body a deep purple-green; it is also called the *diaoliao*. The *yujiu* is the *hujiu*, the same as the present-day speckled dove. *Jue* describes sudden swiftness. *Qiang* means to gather or to dart. *Fang* is sandalwood. *Kong* means to cast, to draw, or to exhaust. *Xi* means "why." *Zhi* means "to go." Hearing of the vastness of the Peng bird, which relies on wind and water to soar aloft, the cicada and dove mock its great size and toil, delighting in their own small forms and ease. Their leaps rise no higher than a few *ren*, darting to the elm and sandalwood to roost; sometimes they fail to reach the next grove, alighting on the ground to rest before taking flight again. Free and content in their nature, they find joy in this. Why must one endure six months of travel, a journey of ninety thousand *li*, braving hardship to reach the south? Those who, in their smallness, laugh at the great, boasting of their own limits while failing to attain freedom—such a thing has never been.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Tiao* is pronounced *tiao*. Sima [Biao] says: the cicada.

**"Xuejiu"** is read as written. Another pronunciation is *yujiao* (于角反). Originally also written as *xue* (鸴), with the same pronunciation. Some versions write it as *yu* (鸒), pronounced *yu* (预). Cui [Yan] says: *Xue* is read as *hua* (滑); *huajiu* (滑鸠) is another name for *huadiao* (滑雕). Sima [Biao] says: *Xuejiu* is a small turtledove. Li [Yi] says: It is a *gudiao* (鹘雕). The *Mao Shi Caomu Shu* states: *Gujiu* (鹘鸠) is the *banjiu* (班鸠). Jianwen [Xiao Gang] says: As in the *Yue Ling*, "the calling turtledove brushes its feathers." **Qingfan’s note:** Yu Yue says: The *Shiwen* states: *Xue* is sometimes written as *yu* (鸒), pronounced *yu* (预). According to the *Wen Xuan*’s Jiang Wenchong’s *Za Ti Shi* ("Beneath the mugwort, the *yu* flies"), Li Shan’s commentary cites this passage from *Zhuangzi* to explain it. He also quotes Sima [Biao] saying: *Yujiu* (鸒鸠) is a small bird. Mao Chang’s *Shi Zhuan* says: *Yusi* (鸒斯) is *beiju* (鹎居); *beiju* is the crow. Pronounced *yu* (豫). Thus, the version Li [Yi] relied upon originally wrote *yu* (鸒), not *xue* (学). The *Shiwen*’s citation of Sima [Biao]—"*Xuejiu* is a small turtledove"—is a later emendation, not the original text. **Now, according to the *Shiwen*: *Xue* is also written as *xue* (鸴).** The *Shuowen* states: *Xue* (鸴) is *hanxue* (雗鸴), the mountain magpie, a bird that knows what is to come. Sometimes written as [missing character]. The *Erya*’s *Shi Niao* says: *Xue* (鸴) is the mountain magpie. Those who write it as *xue* (学) are likely using *xue* as a loan character. *Jiu* (鸠) is the general name for the five turtledoves; *xue* (鸴) and *jiu* (鸠) are thus two different creatures. The explanations cited in the *Shiwen* do not clearly distinguish them.

**"Wo jue"**—Xiang [Xiu] and Xu [Yuan] read it as *que* (缺反), while Li [Yi] reads it as *xue* (穴反). Li Yi says: It describes swiftness. **"Qiang"** (抢) is read as *qiang* (七良反). Sima [Biao] and Li [Yi] say: It means "to alight." Cui [Yan] says: It means "to attach." Zhi Dun says: *Qiang* means "to dash." **Yu Yue says:** Wang [Niansun]’s *Jing Zhuan Shi Ci* states: *Ze* (则) means "or." He cites the *Shiji*’s *Chen Chengxiang Shijia* ("or else I will regret it later") as evidence.

Here the term *ze* (则) should likewise be glossed as "or." *Yu* (榆) is pronounced *yú* by Xu [Shen]; it is the name of a tree. *Fāng* (枋) is pronounced *fāng* by Xu. Li [Yi] says: It is sandalwood. Cui [Yan] says: It is the trunk. Or else: It is the name of a tree. ◎ Lu Wenchang says: The current text reads "Cui says: It is a tree," which is redundant with what follows; the character *xi* (系) is an error.

*Kòng* (控) is read as *kùgòng*. Sima [Biao] says: It means "to cast." He also says: It means "to pull." Cui [Yan] says: It means "to knock." ◎ Yu Yue says: The character *ér* (而) below should be followed by *tú* (图). The preceding passage reads, "And only now will I plan to fly south," and this continues the thought. The *Wen Xuan* commentary cites it as: "How can I traverse ninety thousand *li* and *plan to fly south*?"

**Note [2]:** The farther one travels, the more provisions one must gather; thus, the larger the wings, the thicker the accumulated *qi*.

**Explication:** *Shì* (适) means "to go." *Mǎngcāng* (莽苍) is the color of the outskirts—distant and indistinct. *Guǒrán* (果然) describes a state of fullness. Traveling to the outskirts, one departs and returns within three meals; the journey is not far, and the stomach remains full. For a journey of a hundred *li*, the distance is somewhat greater, and one must pound grain for a single night’s provisions. For a journey of a thousand *li*, the road is long, and one must gather three months’ worth of food to sustain the round trip. Thus, Guo [Xiang]’s commentary states: The farther one travels, the more provisions one must gather; the larger the wings, the thicker the accumulated *qi*.

**Pronunciation and Meaning:** *Mǎng* (莽) is read as *mòlàng* or *mòláng*. *Cāng* (苍) is read as *qīdàng* or with its standard pronunciation. Sima [Biao] says: *Mǎngcāng* is the color of the near outskirts. Li [Yi] says: It means "near the wilds." Zhi Dun says: It refers to the space between graves. Cui [Yan] says: It is the color of the grassy wilds. *Sāncān* (三餐) is read as *qīdān*. *Guǒrán* (果然) is read with its standard pronunciation or as *kǔhuǒ*. All commentators say: It describes a state of fullness. *Chōng* (舂) is read as *shùróng*. *Liáng* (粮) is read as *liáng*.

**Note [3]:** The two creatures refer to the *peng* and the cicada. Comparing the great to the small equalizes their differing inclinations. Why do their inclinations differ? Do they knowingly choose difference? All things are thus by nature, not by design. This is the essence of *xiaoyaoyou* (逍遥).

**Explication:** Guo’s commentary states: The two creatures are the *peng* and the cicada; comparing the great to the small equalizes their differing inclinations. The great *peng* rides the wind for ninety thousand *li*, while the small bird darts between the elm and the sandalwood—though their distances differ, their suitability to their natures is the same. Neither knows the extent of its journey; each takes what suffices and sustains itself, its heavenly mechanism unfolding of itself, without knowing why. Since neither intends superiority or inferiority, how can there be preference for one over the other? The attainment of *xiaoyaoyou* lies herein!

And calling the *peng* a "creature" (*chong*) follows the *Da Dai Liji*, which states: "In the east, the scaled creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the winged dragon as their chief; in the south, the feathered creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the phoenix as their chief; in the west, the furred creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the *qilin* as their chief; in the north, the shelled creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the spirit turtle as their chief; in the center, the naked creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the sage as their chief." Thus, in general parlance, the *peng* is termed a "creature." ◎ Yu Yue notes: The "two creatures" refer to the cicada and the turtledove mentioned above, which mock the *peng*—so small that they cannot comprehend the *peng*'s greatness. Guo's commentary, which takes the "two creatures" as the *peng* and the cicada, is mistaken.

**Textual Notes:**
(1) The character *qiang* (抢) is emended following the original text of the *Shiwen*; the same applies below.
(2) The *Quemiu* and the Jiangnan old edition include the words *er zhi* (而止) after *fang* (枋).
(3) The *Quemiu* edition reads *guo* (果) as *ke* (颗).
(4) The *Quemiu* edition includes the words *bi ye* (彼也) above and below this sentence.

Lesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge; short years do not reach long years. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the dark and the dawn; the cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short years. South of Chu lies the *Mingling*, for which five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the great *chun* tree, for which eight thousand years made a spring, eight thousand years an autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned for his longevity—how pitiful that the multitude should compare themselves to him!

**Commentary:** All things have their nature, and each nature has its limit. All are like years and knowledge—how could they be attained by striving? From this point through the mention of Liezi, examples of long and short years and knowledge are adduced, each credible in its own way, yet none sufficient to surpass the others. Only the person free from dependence, who forgets self and others, who obscures these manifold differences, finds all ways equally attained while claiming no merit. Thus, one who unites the great and the small is one who is neither great nor small; if there were great and small, then even the great *peng* and the sparrow, the minister and the wind-rider, would alike be burdened by things. One who equalizes life and death is one who is neither alive nor dead; if there were life and death, then even the great *chun* and the cicada, Pengzu and the morning mushroom, would be equally cut short. Therefore, to wander where there is neither small nor great is to wander without end; to be obscured where there is neither life nor death is to be without limit. But if one’s *xiaoyaoyou* is bound to a particular realm, then though one be set free to wander, there will still be an end—one remains dependent.

**Commentary:** All things receive *qi* differently and are endowed with distinct allotments. In knowledge, some are bright, some dim; in years, some are short, some long. Thus, the morning mushroom, the *Mingling*, the minister, and Master Rong are all like years and knowledge—how could they be attained by striving? Hence, we know that the natures of things differ and cannot be forcibly imitated.

*Ran* (然): means "thus."
How do we know that years and knowledge do not reach one another to such a degree? This is a hypothetical question to which the following provides the answer.

**Commentary:**
This answers the preceding question.

The "morning mushroom" refers to a fungus that grows when the weather is stagnant and rainy, sprouting from manure piles through heat and steam. It thrives in damp shade but dies upon exposure to sunlight. It is also called the "great zhi" (芝), born at dawn and perishing by dusk—hence the name "morning mushroom." The last day of the lunar month is called *hui* (晦), while the first day is called *shuo* (朔). If it encounters prolonged overcast conditions, it withers within days, never enduring a full thirty-day month—thus it knows nothing of *hui* or *shuo*.

The *huigui* (蟪蛄) is the summer cicada. It emerges from wheat stalks—also called "wheat nodes"—living from summer to autumn, and so knows nothing of spring or winter. The mushroom is born at dawn and dies by dusk, while the cicada grows in summer and perishes in autumn. Such is the brevity of their lifespans—hence they are called "lesser years."

---

The *Mingling* (冥灵) and the great *chun* (椿) are both names of trees, with the sprouting of leaves marking spring and their falling marking autumn. The *Mingling* grows south of Chu, taking two thousand years as a single year. The phrase "of ancient times" refers to the era of Fuxi. The great *chun* tree flourished in that distant age, taking thirty-two thousand years as a single year. The *Mingling* blooms once every five hundred years, while the great *chun* sheds its leaves once every eight thousand years—both spanning such vast springs and autumns that they are called "greater years."

A single name for it is *shunchun*. This differs slightly from what is cited in the *Explanations of Text*.

Now, when the disparity between lifespans is as vast as this, compared to what ordinary people find lamentable, it is indeed lamentable. Yet ordinary people never lament such things, for each being’s nature has its own limit. If one truly knows these limits, then even the slightest difference cannot be bridged—what in the world is there left to grieve? For things never diminish the great out of desire for the small, but invariably envy the great out of the small. Thus, the distinction between great and small has its own fixed allotment, beyond the reach of envy or desire. If this is so, then the burden of envy and desire can be severed. Grief arises from this burden; when the burden is cut off, grief departs. And where grief departs, there has never been a case of one’s nature and life failing to find peace.

*Pengzu* was surnamed *Jian* and named *Keng*, a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. Skilled in nurturing his nature and adept at regulating the cauldron, he presented pheasant soup to Yao, who enfeoffed him at Pengcheng. As his Way could be taken as a model, he was called *Pengzu*. Living through the Xia and Yin dynasties into the Zhou, he reached eight hundred years of age. *Te* means "alone." Because of his long life and longevity, his fame alone resounded through the world. Yet when ordinary people compare themselves to Pengzu, it is deeply lamentable—yet they do not lament, for Pengzu was endowed by nature with far-reaching longevity, not of the same *qi*-kind as themselves. They set him beyond their speech, not daring to sigh in sorrow. Thus, knowing that life has its bounds, how could it be only Pengzu whom they fall short of by a hair’s breadth? In this way, the *chun* tree and the mushroom, Pengzu and the short-lived, are all equalized. Each abides within its allotted portion, and nature and life find peace.

---

*Pengzu*: Li [Yi] says: His name was *Keng*. A minister of Yao, enfeoffed at Pengcheng. Living from the Yu and Xia through to the Shang, he reached seven hundred years of age, hence his renown for long life. The *Shiben* states: Surnamed *Jian*, named *Keng*, he served as *Shoucangshi* in the Shang and *Zhuxiashi* in the Zhou, living eight hundred years. *Jian* is pronounced *jian*. Another account says he was Laozi. Cui [Yuan] says: A minister of Yao, he served through the Yin era, living seven hundred years. Wang Yi’s commentary on the *Chuci* *Tianwen* states: *Peng Keng* is *Pengzu*, who served Emperor Yao. Even at seven hundred years, Pengzu still lamented his lack of longevity, regretting that his pillow was too low and his spittle did not reach far enough. A great-great-grandson of Emperor Ku.

Lu Wenchang notes: The *Yupian* gives *Jian* as *zijian*, a surname, which matches this exactly. This was the ancient pronunciation; those who alter it to *jian* based on the *Guangyun* are incorrect.

Wang Qingfan notes: The *Shenxian Zhuan* says: Pengzu’s personal name was *Keng*, a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. By the end of the Yin dynasty, he was seven hundred and sixty-seven years old and showed no signs of aging. He then went west of the Flowing Sands—he did not die of old age. Now, according to the *Records of the Historian*, *Chu Shijia*: Zhuanxu begot *Cheng*, *Cheng* begot *Juan Zhang*, *Juan Zhang* begot *Chong Li*. *Chong Li* was killed by Emperor Ku, who appointed his younger brother *Wu Hui* to succeed *Chong Li* as *Huozheng*. *Wu Hui* begot *Lu Zhong*, *Lu Zhong* begot *Pengzu*. Tracing the lineage, Pengzu was the son of *Lu Zhong*, a great-great-grandson of Zhuanxu, what the *Li* calls a *laisun*. Cheng Xuanying’s commentary mistakenly follows the *Shenxian Zhuan* in calling him a great-great-grandson of Zhuanxu. The *Explanations of Text* cites Wang Yi’s *Chuci Zhangju*, making him a great-great-grandson of Emperor Ku, which is also incorrect. (Emperor Ku was the nephew of Zhuanxu, named [ ]. Pengzu was the great-great-grandson of Zhuanxu’s son *Cheng*, making him Emperor Ku’s great-great-grandnephew.)

*Te wen*: Read as written. Cui’s version has *dai wen*.

"The *Zhi Xuan* is pronounced as *xuan*. The *Hao Fen* is pronounced *fu wen* (符问), or alternatively *fang yun* (方云)."

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) The *Que Wu* cites Cheng Xuanying’s edition, which includes the phrase "此大年也" (*this is great longevity*) under the "Autumn Floods" section.
(2) The character explanations are omitted here following the annotations below.
(3) "枕高" (*pillowing the heights*)—the original text of the *Shi Wen* is also erroneous; it has been corrected here according to Wang Yi’s commentary on the *Chuci*.

"When Tang questioned Ji, it was thus. In the farthest north of the uninhabited wilds lies the Dark Sea, which is the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, several thousand *li* in breadth, though none know its length; its name is Kun. There is a bird there, named Peng, whose back is like Mount Tai, whose wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. It mounts the whirlwind, spiraling upward on the *yang* vortex for ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds, bearing the blue heavens on its back, and only then does it set its course southward, bound for the Southern Darkness. The marsh wren laughs at it, saying: 'Where does it think it’s going? I leap and flutter upward, but a few fathoms at most before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the utmost of flight! Where does it think it’s going?' Such is the distinction between small and great."

**[1] [Annotation]**
When Tang questioned Ji, it was also said that all things have their limits; when allowed to follow their nature, they flourish. Thus Zhuangzi affirmed the question as correct.

**[Exegesis]**
Tang was a descendant of Emperor Ku and a scion of Xie, surnamed Zi, named Lü, styled Tian Yi. His mother, Fu Du, saw a white vapor piercing the moon and conceived Tang. He was broad below and tapering above, nine *chi* in height. He served the Xia as a feudal lord, possessing sagely virtue, and the feudal lords rallied to him. When Jie’s tyranny prevailed, Tang was imprisoned in the Xia Terrace. Later freed, he allied with the feudal lords at Jingbo, confronted Jie at the ruins of Kunwu, and fought a great battle on the plains of Mingtiao, where Jie fled to Nanchao. After vanquishing Jie, Tang offered the realm to Wu Guang, who refused. Tang then ascended the throne, establishing his capital at Bo, which was later renamed Shang—the founding sovereign of Yin. Ji was a worthy of Tang’s time, also called Tang’s erudite. The *Liezi* refers to him as Xia Ge; *Ge* and *Ji* are phonetically akin, likely a scribal error. As Ji was a worthy, Tang treated him as a teacher, and thus Tang questioned Ji, seeking the ultimate Dao. Ji replied that the natures of things differ, each possessing its inherent allotment; to follow and proceed directly, allowing them to unfold naturally. Tang’s inquiry was profound, imbued with abstruse subtlety, and Zhuangzi affirmed its correctness, hence "it was thus."

**[Shi Wen]**
*Ji*: Li (Yi) says: a worthy of Tang’s time. Another says: Ji Zi. Cui (Yuan) says: the name of those who, like Qi Xie, knew of the *Mingling* and *Da Chun*. Jian (Wen) says: One version: *Tang* means vast, *Ji* means narrow.

◎ Yu Yue says: Li’s note that Ji was a worthy of Tang’s time is correct. Jian Wen’s claim that *Tang* means vast and *Ji* narrow, treating them as adjectives, likely stems from one who has not read the *Liezi*. (This entire passage is based on the *Liezi*; the preceding discussion of Kun and Peng, as well as the *Mingling* and *Da Chun*, all appear in the "Tang’s Questions" chapter.)

◎ Qing Fan’s note: In the *Liezi*’s "Tang’s Questions," Yin Tang questions Xia Ge. Zhang’s commentary: Xia Ge is Xia Ji, styled Zi Ji, a worthy minister of Tang’s time. *Ge* and *Ji* were anciently interchangeable in sound and usage. The *Lunyu*’s "Ji Zicheng" appears in the *Hanshu*’s "Table of Ancient and Modern Persons" as "Ge Zicheng." The *Shijing*’s "匪棘其欲" is cited in the *Liji*’s "Fang Ji" as "匪革其犹." The *Hanshu*’s "Zhuzao Marquis Ge Zhu" is glossed in the *Shiji Suoyin* as *Ge* pronounced *Ji*. All attest to this.

**[2] [Exegesis]**
*Xiu* means length.

The earth takes grass as its hair; in the frigid, frozen lands of the north, where no grass or trees grow, it is called *Qiongfa*—the so-called "land without hair." The Kun fish spans thousands of *li* in breadth, yet none know its length, making clear its vastness.

Now, the Kun and Peng of the Dark Sea have already appeared in the preceding text. Their reappearance here serves to affirm that the earlier citation from *Qi Xie* is sound and authoritative. By now invoking the *Liezi* as further evidence, the text reaffirms its truth with solemn care, reinforcing its meaning.

**[Exegesis of Terms]**
*Qiongfa*: Li [Yi] says: *Fa* means "hair." Sima [Biao] says: It is the land without hair beneath the northernmost pole. Cui [Yuan] says: It is the land without hair in the north. Note: *Mao* refers to grass. Geographical texts state: Mountains take grass and trees as their hair.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: To the north of *Qiongfa*, the *Liezi* reads "to the north of *Qiongfa*’s north." The *Beishi*’s "Biography of the Rouran" states: The Rouran are descendants of the Xiongnu, their origins untraceable. When cut down, they flee to the wilds of *Qiongfa*; when pursued, they vanish into the land of no people. *Qiongfa* thus denotes the most remote and desolate of regions.
*Qi Guang*: Pronounced *gu kuang*.
*Shu Qian*: Pronounced *se zhu*. The same applies below.

**[3] [Exegesis]**
The Peng’s back is vast and immense, its form resembling Mount Song and Mount Hua. The whirling wind twists and coils like a ram’s horn. Then, soaring to graze the azure heavens and cleaving through the clouds, it stirs with fury and surges forth, plotting its course toward the Southern Sea. Thus, in the *Tang’s Questions* chapter of the *Liezi*, Yu-kou states: "How could the world know of such a creature?" When Great Yu traveled, he saw it; Bo Yi named it; and Yi Jian heard of it and recorded it.

**[Exegesis of Terms]**
*Yangjiao*: Sima [Biao] says: The wind spirals upward like a ram’s horn.
*Er Shang*: Pronounced *shi zhang*. The same applies below.

**[4] [Commentary]**
Each attains perfection by fulfilling its nature, and exhausts its utmost by following its own course. Earlier, it was said that the two creatures differ in wing, and thus their destinations vary—one soars over the celestial pond, the other fulfills its will among the elm and sandalwood—each sufficing in its own form without knowing why. Now, the distinction between small and great is spoken of again: each possesses its natural endowment, neither attainable through longing nor lamentable in their difference. Thus, they are restated to clarify this.

**[Exegesis]**
*Qie* means "furthermore," also serving as a grammatical particle.
*Chi* refers to a small marsh.
*Yan* is the sparrow.
Eight *chi* make one *ren*.
*Aoxiang* means to frolic or play.
Yet the sparrow, a small bird, freely roams the marsh, leaping and bounding within the mugwort and wormwood, content in its domain. Thus, it mocks the Peng’s journey of ninety thousand *li*, delighting instead in its flight of a few *ren*. This illustrates the divergence of nature between great and small, and the non-duality of each finding its own sufficiency.

**[Exegesis of Terms]**
*Qie shi*: Read as written; formerly *zi yu* (子余反). The same applies below.
*Chi*: Read as written. Sima [Biao] says: a small marsh. Some texts write it as *chi* (尺), as does Cui’s edition. Jianwen says: writing it as *chi* (尺) is incorrect.
*Yan*: Pronounced *yu jian* (于谏反). The character is also written as 鴳. Sima [Biao] says: *yan* is the sparrow.
◎ Qingfan’s note: *Chi yan* (斥鴳) in the *Exegesis of Terms* is written as *chi yan* (尺鴳) in Cui’s edition, which is correct. The *Shuowen* states: *yan* is the *yan gu* (鴳雇). (The *Jianwei Sheren*, Li Xun, and Sun Yan’s *Erya* commentaries all say: *ju* (鴳) is also called *yan*, the sparrow, as does Guo’s annotation.) *Chi* (斥) and *chi* (尺) are interchangeable in ancient script. The *Wen Xuan*’s annotation to Cao Zhi’s *Qi Qi* states: "The sparrow flies no higher than a *chi*, illustrating its weakness," which clarifies the meaning of *chi* (尺). The *Huainanzi*’s Gao annotation says: "The sparrow of the marsh flies no farther than a *qing* or *mu*, symbolizing its frailty." The *Wen Xuan*’s annotation to Song Yu’s *Dui Chu Wang Wen* on the *chi ze* (尺泽) says: "*Chi ze* means small." Xiahou Zhan’s *Di Yi* writes: "The *chi yan* cannot ascend the mulberry or elm," where the character is correctly written as *chi* (尺). The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* states under *chi yan*: "The sparrow’s length is only a *chi*, hence its name." The *Exegesis of Terms*’s citation of Jianwen saying "writing it as *chi* (尺) is incorrect" is mistaken.
*Teng yue*: Pronounced *you ruo* (由若反).
*Aoxiang*: Pronounced *wu dao* (五刀反).
*Peng hao*: Pronounced *hao dao* (好刀反).
**[Collation]**
(1) *Taishan*: Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *dashan* (大山); the Shidetang edition writes *Taishan* (泰山).
(2) The character *you* (由) is amended following the Shidetang edition.

Thus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct matches one village, whose virtue aligns with one ruler, or whose influence sways one state—when they regard themselves, it is much like this. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Moreover, though the whole world praises them, they are not spurred on; though the whole world blames them, they are not disheartened. They discern the boundary between inner and outer, distinguish the realm of honor and disgrace—this is all. In their dealings with the world, they are not frantically active. Even so, they have yet to establish themselves. Liezi rode the wind and traveled, effortlessly and skillfully, returning after fifteen days. In attaining good fortune, he was not frantically active. Though he avoided walking, he still relied on something. As for one who rides the purity of Heaven and Earth, harnesses the transformations of the six *qi*, and roams the boundless—what does he rely on? Thus it is said: the perfected person is without self, the spirit-like person is without achievement, the sage is without name.

**[1] [Commentary]**
This is also like a bird finding contentment in its own domain.

**[Exegesis]**
*Gu* (故) continues the previous statement; *fu* (夫) introduces what follows. A *guo* (国) is a state of five ranks; a *xiang* (乡) consists of twelve thousand five hundred households. Some possess the wisdom and ability to govern an office; some have renowned reputations, matching the standards of their village; some possess vast virtue, enabling them to face south as rulers, pacifying and nurturing the people of their state. These three differ in endowment and vary in excellence, yet in their sufficiency, they are not unequal. Regarding their own capacities, it is like a bird finding contentment in its own domain.

*Zhi xiao*: Pronounced *zhi* (智); below, *hu jiao* (户教反).
*Xing*: Pronounced *xia meng* (下孟反).
*Bi*: Pronounced *pi zhi* (毗至反) or *fu zhi* (扶至反). Li [Yi] says: to match.
*Er zheng*: Read as written. Sima [Biao] says: to verify. Cui and Zhi say: to accomplish.
◎ Qingfan’s note: *Er zheng yi guo* (而征一国) lacks a gloss in the *Exegesis of Terms* and Guo’s commentary. Cheng’s exegesis reads *er* (而) as a connective particle, which is incorrect. *Er* (而) should be read as *neng* (能), as *er* and *neng* were interchangeable in ancient pronunciation. *Guan* (官), *xiang* (乡), *jun* (君), and *guo* (国) correspond to *zhi* (知), *ren* (仁), *de* (德), and *neng* (能), showing that *er* (而) is not a connective particle. The *Huainanzi*’s *Yuan Dao* chapter says: *er yi shao zheng duo* (而以少正多), with Gao’s annotation: "*Er* means *neng* (能)." The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Qu Si* and *Bu Qu* chapters also gloss *er* as *neng*. The *Mozi*’s *Shang Tong* chapter states: "Thus, the ancient sage-kings were *er* (能) and careful in elevating unity to establish leaders," and "Why is the world well-governed? Because they were *er* (能) in unifying principles to govern." The *Fei Ming* chapter says: "Not *er* (能) in correcting their ears’ and eyes’ desires." The *Chu Ci*’s *Jiu Zhang* says: "Who in the world *er* (能) knows it?" The *Qi Ce* says: "Who *er* (能) will go with me to the feudal lords?" In all these cases, *er* is equivalent to *neng*. The *Shu Jing*’s *Yao Dian* says: *rou yuan neng er* (柔远能迩), while the Han dynasty *Du You Ban* stele writes *er* (而). The *Gao Yao Mo* says: *neng zhe er hui* (能哲而惠), while the *Wei Wei Heng Fang* stele writes *neng zhe neng hui* (能悊能惠), and the *Shiji*’s *Xia Ben Ji* writes *neng zhi neng hui* (能智能惠).

The *Li Yun Zheng Yi* states: "Liu Xiang’s *Shuo Yuan* writes the character *neng* uniformly as *er*. This is an example of that."

[2] [Annotation] Not yet able to equalize, hence there is laughter.
[Commentary] *Zi* is a title for one of virtue, surnamed Rong, a native of Song. *You ran* means "thus." Though Master Rong was able to forget being, he had not yet relinquished non-being, hence the laughter. Those attached to official ranks remain bound by titles and emoluments, while those of empty indifference still harbor derision, seeing thus as cause for inequality. Previously, the lesser laughed at the greater, showing that the greater do not boast; now, the greater laugh at the lesser, so the lesser do not aspire. Those whose nature and destiny remain unsettled have simply not yet heard of this principle.

[Textual Notes]
*Song Rongzi*: Sima [Qian] and Li [Xun] say: a native of the state of Song. Cui [Yuan] says: a worthy man.
*You ran xiao zhi*: Cui and Li say: *you* describes the manner of laughter. The case holds that *you* means "to consider laughable."

[3] [Annotation] To examine and find contentment in oneself.
[Commentary] *Ju* means "all." *Quan* means "to encourage." *Ju* means "resentment and dejection." Master Rong, following his nature and embracing the Dao, towered loftily above the common world. Even if all the world praised him, it would not increase his encouragement; if the entire realm slandered him, it would not add to his dejection—he examined and found contentment in himself.

[Textual Notes]
*Yu zhi*: pronounced *yu*.
*Jia ju*: *ci lü* rhyme, meaning "to defeat."

[4] [Annotation] Inwardly the self, outwardly things.
[Commentary] Master Rong knew that inwardly there was no true self and outwardly no true things, so he cast aside both inner and outer, forgetting both self and things. Thus, he was settled in the distinction between inner and outer, unwavering and unerring.

[5] [Annotation] Honoring oneself and humiliating others.
[Commentary] He forgot encouragement and dejection in the face of praise or blame, merging poverty and success with honor and disgrace. Thus, he could turn his illumination inward to clarify the mind’s wisdom, and through profound insight discern the realm of things—no longer inwardly the self and outwardly things, nor honoring himself and humiliating others.

[Textual Notes]
*zhi jing*: pronounced *ju ling*. ◎Qing Fan notes: The *Shiwen* writes *jing*, interchangeable with the ancient character for "realm."

[6] [Annotation] Nor could he surpass this.
[Commentary] *Si* means "this." *Yi* means "to cease." Master Rong’s wisdom and virtue ceased at this point.
[Textual Notes]
*neng fu*: pronounced *fu you*.

[7] [Annotation] Sufficient in himself, thus at ease in the world.
[Commentary] *Shu shu* means "eagerly, restlessly." Master Rong followed his nature, empty and indifferent, advancing straightforwardly with the principle, never employing his wisdom to seek or his mind to strive for the Dao. Dwelling beyond things, he was not restless.
[Textual Notes]
*shu shu*: pronounced *shuo*. The same below.

Xu pronounced *suo lu* with an alternative reading *sang lü*. Sima [Biao] says: "like *jiji* (restlessly)." Cui [Yuan] says: "a sense of urgency." [Emperor] Jianwen reads it as *suo yu*, meaning "to calculate." *Gu xian* is pronounced *xian*, originally also written as 閒.

[8] [Annotation] He was only able to affirm himself, yet could not attain the state of "nothing that is not permissible."
[Commentary] *Shu* means "to establish." Master

"Coldly" describes a cool appearance. The *Wen Xuan* annotation to Jiang Wenchong's *Miscellaneous Styles* poem cites the same gloss. The *Shiwen* omits this.

[10] [Annotation] If one relies on external conditions, then even riding the wind cannot circumnavigate the world in a single moment.
[Commentary] A *xun* is ten days. Having attained the Dao of wind immortality, he roamed the world, returning home every fifteen days. Yet he could not ride all things without exception, and thus could not circumnavigate the world in a single moment.

[11] [Annotation] He naturally rode the wind—this was not something he sought with restless effort.
[Commentary] *Zhi* means "to attain." Lie Yukou’s good fortune in wind immortality arose from his indifference to heat and cold, his empty mind embracing natural spontaneity, not from striving with deliberate intent. This illustrates the essential principle of the Dao: the key lies in forgetting the mind. If one employs calculation and deliberation, one strays far from it.
◎ My late father remarked: "Not being restless" is akin to the *Record of Rites* saying, "the world has but one man." *Zhi fu* ("attaining good fortune") refers to fully embodying natural blessings. Riding the wind still depends on the movement of celestial mechanisms. Guo Xiang’s claim that "he naturally rode the wind, not seeking it with restless effort" is mistaken.

[12] [Annotation] Without wind, he could not travel—this necessarily entails reliance. Only one who rides all things is without dependence.
[Commentary] Though riding the wind freed him from walking, he could not advance without it, still requiring support. From the self-governing official downward to Song Rong and Lie Yukou, their wisdom and virtue varied in excellence, yet none had attained perfect forgetfulness, all remaining dependent. Only by following the nature of the myriad things and traversing the paths of transformation can one achieve all things and fully realize the sublime attainment of perfect freedom.

[13] [Annotation] "Heaven and earth" is the collective name for the myriad things. Heaven and earth take the myriad things as their body, and the myriad things must take spontaneity as their norm. Spontaneity is that which is not done yet naturally occurs. Thus, the great Peng’s ability to soar high, the minnow’s ability to fly low, the *chun* tree’s ability to live long, and the morning mushroom’s ability to live briefly—all these are what spontaneity enables, not what deliberate action achieves. Not acting yet naturally able, this is the norm. Therefore, riding the norm of heaven and earth is precisely following the nature of the myriad things; mastering the transformations of the six qi is precisely traversing the paths of change. Proceeding thus, where could one encounter limits? Whatever one meets, one rides—what further reliance could there be? This is the freedom of the person of utmost virtue, who mystically unites self and other.
If one relies on external conditions, then even Liezi’s lightness and wonder cannot travel without wind. He must obtain what he relies upon before attaining freedom—how much more so for the great Peng! Only one who darkly merges with things and follows great transformation can be without reliance and perpetually unobstructed. How could this be merely one’s own unobstructedness? Moreover, by following those who rely on conditions, one ensures they do not lose what they rely upon. If what they rely upon is not lost, they too merge with great unobstructedness. Thus, I cannot equate reliance and non-reliance; but when each abides in its nature, the celestial mechanism unfolds of itself, and one receives without awareness, then I cannot distinguish between them. If even non-reliance is insufficient to distinguish from reliance, how much less can the great and small of those who rely be differentiated!
[Commentary] "Heaven and earth" is the collective name for the myriad things. The myriad things are another term for spontaneity. As for the six qi, Li Yi says: dawn’s morning glow, noon’s true yang, sunset’s flying spring, midnight’s *hangxie*, together with heaven’s and earth’s qi, make the six qi. Du Yu says: the six qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. Zhi Daolin says: the six qi are heaven, earth, and the four seasons. *Bian* means "transformation." *Wu hu* means "in what" or "where." The sage without reliance, with an empty mind embodying the Dao, can ride the correct principle of the Two Modes, follow the spontaneity of the myriad things, master the six qi to roam freely, and blend with all spirits in transformation. If nothing is not followed, where could one not penetrate? Clearly traversing the boundless, where could one rely on anything?
[Shiwen] On the *six qi*, Sima [Biao] says: yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. Li [Yi] says: dawn is morning glow, noon is true yang, sunset is flying spring, midnight is *hangxie*, and heaven’s *xuan* and earth’s *huang* make the six qi. Wang Yi’s *Chu Ci* annotation says: Master Lingyang Ziming’s classic states: in spring, one eats morning glow—morning glow is the yellow qi when the sun is about to rise. In autumn, one eats sinking yin—sinking yin is the reddish-yellow qi after sunset. In winter, one eats *hangxie*—*hangxie* is the midnight qi of the north. In summer, one eats true yang—true yang is the midday qi of the south. Together with heaven’s *xuan* and earth’s *huang* qi, these are the six qi. *Hang* is pronounced *hu dang*; *xie* is pronounced *xia jie*. Zhi [Daolin] says: the qi of heaven, earth, and the four seasons.
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Shiwen* cites various interpretations of the six qi, each differing. Sima [Biao] takes yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness as the six qi—this is the most ancient explanation. Li [Yi]’s interpretation, combining dawn, noon, sunset, midnight, and heaven’s and earth’s qi, seems somewhat forced. Wang Yi and Zhi Dun take heaven, earth, and the four seasons as the six qi. Yet the qi of heaven and earth are vast beyond compare, and the four seasons derive their qi from heaven and earth, so it seems improper to list the four seasons alongside heaven and earth as six. Wang Yinglin says: the six qi are lesser yin sovereign fire, greater yin damp earth, lesser yang ministerial fire, yang brightness dry metal, greater yang cold water, and reverting yin wind wood—fire alone having two.

Heaven takes six as its measure, thus qi completes one full cycle in six periods. The *Zuozhuan* records the words of the physician He, stating that heaven possesses six qi (the commentary explains: yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness), which descend to generate the five flavors—this aligns with the numbers of five and six in the *Suwen*. (Quanzu Wang notes: "Heaven five, earth six" appears in the *Book of Changes*, while "heaven six, earth five" appears in the *Guoyu*. Thus the *Han History* states, "Five and six are the harmonious mean of heaven and earth." Yet the *Zuozhuan*’s account differs from the *Suwen*.) Shen Gua’s *Dream Pool Essays* says: The school of recipe masters matches the six qi to the six spirits. The so-called Green Dragon is the qi of reverting yin in the east; the rest follow this pattern of correspondence. Only the north has two: the Dark Warrior, which is the qi of greater yang cold water, and the Flying Serpent, which is the qi of lesser yang ministerial fire. In humans, these correspond to the kidneys, which also have two: the left as greater yang cold water, the right as lesser yang ministerial fire—this is the intermingling of *kan* and *li*. The central greater yin damp earth is the Encircling Array, corresponding to the spleen.

The theories of the six qi are as tangled as a mass of hempen threads, with no consensus. In my humble opinion, two explanations may be considered. First, the six qi are the *Hongfan*’s rain, sunshine, heat, cold, wind, and seasonableness. Rain corresponds to wood; sunshine to metal; heat to fire; cold to water; wind to earth—these are the five qi. When the five qi are seasonable, they become the harmonious qi of the five phases; combined, they form the six qi. Qi may be harmonious or discordant; discord brings change, and change requires means to govern it, hence the saying "to govern the changes of the six qi." Second, the six qi are the six emotions. The *Book of Han*’s biography of Yi Feng cites his teacher’s explanation of the six emotions: The emotion of the north is desire, and desire manifests as greed and rapacity, governed by *shen* and *zi*; the emotion of the east is anger, and anger manifests as cruelty, governed by *hai* and *mao*; the emotion of the south is aversion, and aversion manifests as integrity and uprightness, governed by *yin* and *wu*; the emotion of the west is joy, and joy manifests as magnanimity, governed by *ji* and *you*; the emotion of the upper region is delight, and delight manifests as treachery, governed by *chen* and *wei*; the emotion of the lower region is sorrow, and sorrow manifests as impartiality, governed by *xu* and *chou*. These two explanations may also serve as references. The pronunciation of *zhi bian* follows the common reading.

Change.

Cui’s edition has "harmony." ◎ Qingfan’s note: *Bian* and *upright* form an antithesis, so *bian* should be read as *change*. The *Guangya* states: "*Bian* means change." The *Yi Jing*’s *Wenyan* commentary on *Kun* reads: "It is because of *bian* that it was not discerned early"—Xun’s edition has *change*. *Bian* and *change* were used interchangeably in antiquity. Cui’s gloss of *harmony* is mistaken.

*Wu hu* is pronounced *wu*. The commentary is the same.

【14】【Commentary】Without self, one accords with things; according with things, one reaches *it*.

【Exegesis】*Wu ji* is pronounced *ji*. The commentary is the same. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The modern text omits *wu* (without), and the same applies below.

*Er wang* is pronounced *yu kuang*. Some editions have *zhi* (reach) instead.

【15】【Commentary】Things have never ceased to be born of the natural, yet they must rejoice in relying on needles and stones—thus when principle reaches its utmost, traces vanish. Now, according with things without aiding them, one becomes one with the ultimate principle, and so there is no achievement.

【Exegesis】*Yu zhen* is pronounced *zhi zhen* or *zhi lin*.

【16】【Commentary】The "sage" is merely the name for things attaining their nature; it is insufficient to name *how* they attain it.

【Exegesis】Speaking of *essence* refers to its substance; speaking of *spirit* refers to its function; speaking of *sage* refers to its name. Thus, in terms of substance, one speaks of *utmost*; in terms of function, one speaks of *spirit*; in terms of name, one speaks of *sage*—in reality, they are one. Attaining the utmost of the numinous is called *utmost*; being unfathomable like yin and yang is called *spirit*; rightly naming the myriad things is called *sage*. In one person, these three may coexist, but to distinguish their functions and names, they are spoken of as three separate persons. These three persons are the same as those earlier described as "riding the uprightness of Heaven and Earth, steering the *bian* of the six qi." To conclude this person’s virtue of *wu dai* (having no reliance) and manifest their substance and function, the text thus says, "Therefore, it is said..."

◎ Qingfan’s note: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Ren Yansheng’s *Letter to the Grand Marshal’s Recorder* cites Sima [Biao] as saying: "The spirit-person has no achievement, meaning they cultivate the natural and do not establish achievement. The sage has no name, meaning they do not establish a name." The *Exegesis* omits this.

Yao offered the world to Xu You, saying: "The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch-fire does not cease—is it not difficult for it to compete with their light? The timely rain has fallen, yet one still irrigates—is it not laborious for it to rival their moisture? If you were to stand forth, the world would be well-ordered, yet I still occupy this position—I see myself as deficient. I beg to yield the world to you."

(1) **Annotation**: Yao was the son of Emperor Ku, surnamed Yiqi, styled Fangxun. His mother, Qingdu, conceived him after Ku was moved by a crimson dragon. Yao stood ten *chi* tall, broad below and tapering above, with eight-colored brows and feet treading the stars of the Wings. He possessed sagely virtue. At fifteen, he was enfeoffed as Lord of Tang; at twenty-one, he ascended the imperial throne in place of his elder brother, establishing his capital at Pingyang, and was styled Taotang. After seventy-two years on the throne, he abdicated in favor of Shun. He died at the age of one hundred and twenty-eight and was buried in Yangcheng, posthumously named Yao. According to the rules of posthumous naming, "Yao" signifies "one who transmits sagely virtue with benevolent wings," referring to his merit in passing the throne to Shun.

Xu You was a recluse, surnamed Xu, named You, styled Zhongwu, a native of Yangcheng in Yingchuan. He dwelled in seclusion on Mount Ji, studied under Nie Que, ate from the mountains, and drank from the rivers. Yao, recognizing his worthiness, offered him the imperial throne. Upon hearing this, Xu You went to the river to wash his ears. When Chaofu came to water his calf, he led it away, saying, "Lest it foul my water." After his death, Yao had his tomb sealed and posthumously named him Duke Ji, for he was Yao’s teacher.

**Exegesis**: *Yao*—Emperor of Tang.
*Xu You*—a recluse who lived in seclusion on Mount Ji.
Sima [Qian] states: a native of Yangcheng in Yingchuan.
Jianwen states: a native of Huaili in Yangcheng.
Li [Yi] states: styled Zhongwu.

**[II] [Exegesis on "Torch Fire"]**
Torch fire is akin to a flaming brand—also a small fire. In the time of Shennong, rain fell every fifteen days, called "timely rain." With the sun and moon illuminating all, how could torchlight be needed? When timely rains pour abundantly, what use is the moisture of irrigation? Yao, in his humility and deference, yielded to others and withdrew himself. Thus, his words in offering the throne were a grand tribute to Zhongwu.

**Exegesis**:
*Jué*—also written as *jiāo*, pronounced *jué*. Guo [Pu] reads it as *zhuó*. Sima [Qian] states: "to kindle." Xiang [Xiu] states: "fire kindled by man." Another says: *jiāo* fire refers to a small fire. The *Zilin* states: *jué* is torch fire, read *zǐ zhào*. *Jiāo* is what holds the kindled fire, read *zǐ yuē*.
◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Shuowen* states: *jué* is *jù* fire (a bundle of reeds burned for ritual purification). Lü Buwei said: "When Tang obtained Yi Yin, he kindled beacon fires and consecrated with a sacrificial boar." (Note: *jù* means to bind reeds and burn them. *Fú* is the rite of expelling evil.)
*Jiāo* is what holds the kindled fire. Duan Yucai’s note: "What holds the fire" refers to fire held by a person. The *Liji: Shaoyi* says, "One holds the torch and carries the *jiāo*." All torches are called *zhú*; unlit ones are called *jiāo*. *Jiāo* is thus the torch itself. Examining Xu Shen’s definition, *jiāo* originally meant an unlit torch; if unlit, it cannot be said to be "unextinguished." The *Exegesis* citing Sima and Li’s version as *jiāo* is incorrect. (*Guangyun*: *jiāo* means fire-damaged, interchangeable with *jiāo*. A separate meaning.)
*Jìn*—read *zǐ zhèn*.
*Guàn*—read *gǔ luàn*.
◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Zhengyun* states: *jìn* means to soak or gradually permeate. The *Yinfu Jing* says: "The Dao of heaven and earth gradually permeates, thus yin and yang prevail." The *Yi Jing*’s *Lin* hexagram says: "Strength gradually grows." *Jìn* means gradual. The *Boya* states: *guàn* means to gather or to irrigate. *Jìnguàn* thus refers to gradual permeation and soaking.

**[III] [Exegesis on "Governing"]**
*Zhì* means to rectify. *Shī* means to preside. *Zhì* means to confer. Yao had taken Xu You as his teacher, hence addressed him as "Master." If Zhongwu were to ascend the throne, the realm would surely attain great peace. Yet I, still presiding over things, see myself as lacking and unworthy. Thus, I request to yield the imperial position to a worthy man.

**Exegesis**:
*"The realm is governed"*—read *zhí lì*.

**Collation**:
(1) The characters *fú* and *dé* are amended according to the *Shuowen*’s original text.

Xu You said: "You govern the realm, and the realm is already well-governed. Yet I would still replace you—would I do so for the sake of reputation? Reputation is but the guest of reality. Would I become a guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than its fill. Return, my lord, and leave me with no use for the realm! Though the cook does not prepare the feast, the invocator does not leap over the wine vessels and sacrificial stands to take his place."

**[I] [Commentary]**
One who can bring order to the realm does not govern it. Thus, Yao governed by not governing—he did not govern it yet it was governed. Now, Xu You clearly states the realm is already governed, so there is nothing for him to replace. Yet the governance truly stems from Yao, hence his words "you govern it." One should forget the words to seek their underlying analogy. Some, however, claim: "Yao governed and thus it was governed; Yao did not govern, yet through Xu You it was governed." This is far from the truth. Governance arises from non-governance; action emerges from non-action. Yao’s sufficiency lies in himself—how could he rely on Xu You? If one insists that only by withdrawing into mountain forests can non-action be achieved, such talk from Zhuangzi and Laozi is why they are rejected by those in power. Those in power remain entrenched in the realm of action and do not return—this is the reason.

**[Exegesis]**
*Zhì* means to order. *Jì* means complete.

Yao governed the world for so long that it ascended to great peace, with all within the four seas and eight wastes entirely clear and tranquil—why trouble himself to yield to me, expending words in vain refusal? Yet when one examines Zhuangzi’s writings, he disparages Yao and exalts Xu You, while in Guo Xiang’s commentary, he devalues Xu You and esteems Yao—why is this? It is to clarify that the great sage Fangxun and the great worthy Zhongwu represent two paths, vastly distant from one another. Thus, Yao, seated behind the screen at Fenyang, lost the world, while Xu You, refusing to level his customs, stood alone upon the high mountain—whether one is all-encompassing in illumination or partial in immersion is plainly evident. For this reason, Zhuangzi, seizing upon the traces of abdication, put forth his discourse on the torch’s flame; Guo Xiang, perceiving the mind that depends on nothing, further advanced the doctrine of non-governance. This may be called delving into subtleties and probing obscurities, fully grasping the text to harmonize with its meaning. One ought to seek its underlying analogy, leaving no room for the slightest doubt.

**[Exegesis]**
Xu You, aloof upon Mount Ji, roamed freely by the Ying River, loathing the stench of fame and profit, disgusted by the clamor of reputation. Yet Yao, with earnest insistence, still hoped he would take his place. Had Xu You ascended the ninth of the five positions, he would have borne the name of a ruler of ten thousand chariots. Yet in truth, names arise from reality: reality is internal and primary, while names are external and secondary. To abandon the primary and seize the secondary, to lose the internal and seek the external—this is not what recluses esteem, hence his words, “I would become but a guest.”

**[Textual Notes]**
*Lìng* (令): read as *lìchéng* (力呈), same below.
**[2]** **[Commentary]**
One who acts on his own confronts things, while one who accords with things has no opposition to them. Thus, Yao had no opposition to the world, while Xu You was matched with Ji and Xie. How can this be said? One who merges with things is such that the myriad things cannot depart from him. Therefore, with a mindless and mysterious responsiveness, he follows only what he encounters, drifting like a boat untethered—whether it moves east or west is not of his own doing. Thus, he goes nowhere without sharing all with the people, and nowhere does he fail to be the lord of the world. To be such a lord is like heaven’s natural elevation—this is truly the virtue of a ruler. If one stands alone, loftily erect atop a mountain peak, this is not because men are inclined to self-preservation, guarding the partial preferences of a single household—how could one monopolize this? Such a one is but a single thing among the vulgar, an outer minister to Yao. To replace the inner lord with an outer minister is to bear the name of a ruler without the responsibility of one.

《Fanghu》: *fang* as in 芳, *jian* as in 剑.
《Feifu》: *fu* as in 扶. Below, *mingfu* follows the same pronunciation.

【Commentary】Each nature has its limit; if one is content with reaching that limit, then the wealth of all under heaven is superfluous!
【Exegesis】The *jiaoliao* is a clever little bird, also called the "craftswoman sparrow," the "female artisan," or the "peach-bird," which prefers secluded places and skillfully builds its nest. The *yan-shu* is a creature the size of an ox, reddish-black in color, with roebuck-like legs, three-hooved feet, ears like an elephant’s, and a white-tipped tail, fond of drinking from rivers. Yet the bird’s nest extends no further than a single branch, needing no luxuriant forest; the beast drinks only to fill its belly, requiring no vast expanse of water. How much more so for Xu You, who finds contentment in a thatched hut, spurns the golden gates of the palace, delights in coarse fare, and disdains the finest delicacies!

【Pronunciation Notes】《Jiao》: *ziyao* (子遥) *fan*.
《Liao》: *liao* (辽). Li Yi says: The *jiaoliao* is a small bird. Guo Pu says: The *jiaoliao* is the peach-sparrow.
《Yanshu》: read as written. Li Yi says: It is the *xishu* (mouse). *Shuowen* states: The *fenshu* is also called the *yanshu*. *Fen*: *fuwen* (扶问) *fan*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The character "音" was missing in older editions. According to convention, when a pronunciation is added to a character not found in the main text or commentary, the word "音" should precede it. Here, it is added following earlier examples.
◎ Qingfan notes: Li Zhen says: The *yanshu*; Li Yi calls it the *xishu*. According to *Shuowen*, under *fen*: "A burrowing mouse, transformed from a shrike, also called the *yanshu*." *Yan* is sometimes written as , and commonly as . *Yupian* states: The *yan* is a large rat. *Guangya* says: The *shu* is the *fenshu*. The original character is 艹, with a rat moving underground. Tao’s commentary notes: Commonly called the "hidden rat" or "fenshu," it constantly tunnels through cultivated land, and can be caught by digging. *Shuowen* under *xi* states: The *xi* is a small mouse. *Erya* says: The *xi* is a mouse with a venomous sting. The *Gongyang* commentary on the seventh year of Duke Cheng states: The *xishu* is the smallest of mice. *Bowuzhi* says: The *xishu* is the smallest of the mouse kind; when it eats, one does not feel the pain at the time, and it is also called the "sweet mouse." From this, we know that the *yanshu* and *xishu* are clearly distinct, and Li Yi’s identification is mistaken.

【Commentary】To equalize the useless—this is what Yao alone possessed. It is clear that one who embraces openness has no fixed direction, and thus all under heaven joyfully elevates him without tiring.
【Exegesis】*Yu* means "I." Xu You, with his few desires and incorruptible purity, refused Yao’s abdication, so he said to Yao: "You should swiftly return to the imperial carriage, go back to the Purple Palace, and let the words of abdication rest. The honor of ruling the four seas is of no use to me; what would I do with the nobility of the ninefold eminence?"
【Pronunciation Notes】《Gui xiu hu jun》: pause after *jun*. Alternatively, pause after *hu*, with *jun* read separately.
《Huaihuo》: *hua* (呼活) *fan*.
《Lepui》: *le* (洛).
《Buyàn》: *yuyàn* (于艳).

【Commentary】The kitchen attendant and the ancestral invocator each abide in their appointed roles; birds, beasts, and the myriad things each find sufficiency in what they receive; Emperor Yao and Xu You each rest in what they encounter—this is the ultimate reality of all under heaven. Each attains their reality, so what more is there to do? They are self-sufficient, that is all. Thus, though Yao and Xu You’s paths differ, their freedom is one and the same.
【Exegesis】The *paoren* refers to those who oversee the imperial kitchens, equivalent to today’s officials in charge of provisions. The *shi* is the spirit tablet in the ancestral temple; the *zhu* is today’s Grand Invocator of the Grand Temple, who holds the ritual tablets and invokes blessings before the *shi*, hence the term *shizhu*. The *zun* is a wine vessel, and the *zu* is a meat platter. As for the *paoren* and *shizhu*, each has their own duties. Even if the royal chef were negligent and refused to prepare the food, the invocator would never overstep their bounds, abandon the wine and meat vessels, and take over the cooking—just as Emperor Yao, in abdicating the throne, did not govern the world, and Xu You did not leave his mountain forest to assume the imperial seat. Thus, the commentary says: "Emperor Yao and Xu You each rest in what they encounter."
【Pronunciation Notes】《Paoren》: *baojiao* (鲍交) *fan*; Xu Shen reads *fujao* (扶交) *fan*. The official in charge of the kitchen. The *Zhouli* has the office of *paoren*.
◎ Qingfan notes: *Shuowen* states: *Pao* means "kitchen." The *Liji Wangzhi* says: "Three are sufficient for the ruler’s kitchen." The commentary states: *Pao* is today’s kitchen. The *Zhouli Paoren* commentary says: *Pao* means "to wrap"; wrapped meat is called *baoju*. (Wrapped is *bao*, lined is *ju*.) One edition omits the character *ren* under *pao*, which is incorrect.
《Shizhu》: *zhiliu* (之六) *fan*. To invoke the words of ghosts and spirits is called *zhu*.
《Zun》: *zicun* (子存) *fan*; originally also written as 尊.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: 尊 is the proper form.
《Zu》: Xu Shen reads *celü* (侧吕) *fan*.
【Collation Notes】(1) Yu Yue says: This originally read "I will be the reality," forming a parallel with the earlier "I will be the name." *Shi* (reality) and *bin* (guest) are graphically similar, and the error arose from the preceding phrase "reality and guest."
(2) The characters "当涂" are added following the Shidetang edition.
(3) The characters "之行" appear as "之地" in Zhao Jianyi’s edition and as "天地" in the Shidetang edition.

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu, saying: "I heard words from Jie Yu—grand yet without measure, sweeping yet never returning. I was alarmed and terrified by his speech, as if it were the Milky Way, boundless and without end. Vast and divergent, it does not accord with human sentiment."
【Exegesis】Jian Wu and Lian Shu were both men of ancient times who embraced the Dao. Jie Yu was surnamed Lu, named Tong, styled Jie Yu, a worthy and reclusive man of Chu, a contemporary of Confucius.

Feigning madness and refusing office, he always devoted himself to tilling the soil. The King of Chu, knowing his worth, offered him a hundred *yi* of gold and two carriages with teams of four horses, but he declined them all. Thus, shouldering his tools and with his wife bearing their belongings on her head, he wandered among mountains and seas, and none knew where he ultimately came to rest.

Jian Wu, having heard Jie Yu’s words as boundless and without measure, questioned Lian Shu to inquire into their meaning. The phrase *"I heard words from Jie Yu"* means he heard Jie Yu’s speech. Zhuangzi here cites three worthies to illustrate the singular sagacity of Yao, and the particulars of what he heard are set forth in the text below.

**Exegesis Notes:**
*"Jian Wu"* – Li (Yun) says: a worthy man. Sima (Biao) says: a spirit-name.
*"Lian Shu"* – Li (Yun) says: a man who embraced the Dao.
*"Jie Yu"* – Also written as *Yu*; pronounced *Yu*. Jie Yu was a man of Chu, surnamed Lu, named Tong. Huangfu Mi says: Jie Yu tilled the soil himself; the King of Chu sent envoys to summon him with a hundred *yi* of gold and two carriages with teams of four horses, but he did not respond.

**Annotation (2):**
What Jian Wu heard from Jie Yu was vast and unbounded, sweeping in its scope yet lacking precise measure, proceeding in one direction without returning to offer any trace for reflection. Privately, he heard these words with alarm and terror, as if gazing upon the celestial Milky Way—lofty, distant, and pure—where, though one might trace its source and flow, no end could ever be found.

**Exegesis Notes:**
*"Without measure"* – Ding reads *dang* as in *lang*; Sima (Biao) says: the words were grand and without restraint.
*"Alarmed and terrified"* – Read *pu-bu*; the *Guang Ya* says: to fear.

**Annotation (3):**
*"Divergent"* suggests excess and disparity, a bearing of direct advance without regard for consequences. Jie Yu’s words did not align with common custom, often exceeding bounds and failing to conform to worldly sentiment—hence his grand pronouncements did not accord with the norms of the village.

**Exegesis Notes:**
*"Vast"* – Read *tai*; Xu reads *chi-zuo*.
*"Divergent"* – Xu reads *gu-ding*; Sima’s edition writes *jing* as *stem*.
*"Disparity"* – Read *chi-ding*; Li (Yun) says: *jing-ting* means excessive and extreme.
◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Liu Xiaobiao’s *"Disputation on Fate"* cites Sima (Biao) as saying: *"Extreme"* means a cliff; the words were as vast as the Milky Way, without any boundary. *"Divergent"* means excessively extreme. The *Exegesis Notes* omit this.

"The *Not Near*" refers to proximity.

Lian Shu said: "What did his words speak of?"
**Annotation [1]:** What did Lu Tong’s teachings entail? This inverts the intent of Jian Wu’s account.

He replied: "Far off on Mount Gushe, there dwells a spirit-person, whose skin is like ice and snow, whose grace is as supple as a maiden’s. They eat no grains, but draw in the wind and drink the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, mount flying dragons, and wander beyond the four seas. Their spirit congeals, so that things suffer no blight nor plague, and the harvest ripens. Yet I deem this mad and unbelievable."

**Commentary [1]:** All this is metaphorical speech. The "spirit-person" is what we now call the sage. Though the sage may dwell in the halls of court, their heart is no different than if they were in the mountains and forests—how could the world recognize this? They see only the yellow canopy and jade seals, assuming these suffice to bind their heart with regalia; they see them traverse mountains and rivers, sharing in the people’s affairs, assuming this suffices to weary their spirit. How could they know the perfection of the most perfect remains unharmed? Now, speaking of one possessed of royal virtue and lodging them on this mountain is to clarify that the world has no means to recognize them. Thus, they are entrusted to the farthest reaches and pushed beyond the bounds of sight and hearing. The "maiden" is one unharmed within by external things.

**Exegesis:** *Miao* means distant. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: Mount Gushe lies beyond the encircling sea, where a spirit-sage dwells, gathering responsiveness to things. When the time calls for bowing and yielding, they become Yao or Shun; when the time calls for halberds and shields, they become Tang or Wu.

Graceful and yielding, soft and weak. The "maiden" is an unmarried woman. This speaks of the sage whose movement and stillness respond in harmony, such that emptiness and being are both illumined. Though dwelling in the halls of state, they are no different from those in the mountains and forests—blending their light with the dust, remaining unstained amid defilement. Ice and snow are taken for their purity; "graceful and yielding" serves as a metaphor for gentleness; the "maiden" is unharmed by things; Mount Gushe is spoken of for its remoteness. This clarifies that Yao’s abundant virtue, profound and mysterious, is thus entrusted to the farthest reaches and pushed beyond the bounds of sight and hearing. This is but a parable—why must there be an actual Mount Gushe? One should forget words and seek what they signify. This is what Jian Wu recounted from his former hearing in reply to Lian Shu.

**Exegesis:** The five grains are millet, sorghum, hemp, beans, and wheat. It speaks of the spirit-sage who, descending to respond to things, bears the essence of pure integrity and receives the finest qi of yin and yang. Though they rely on things for sustenance, they are not made by the five grains; they entrust themselves to wind and dew for clarity and emptiness—how could the four seasons alter them?

The sage’s wisdom illumines with spiritual penetration, following things without contrivance—thus it is said they "ride the clouds." Swift without haste, transforming and manifesting without constancy—thus it is said they "drive flying dragons."

Dwelling above the myriad things while their spirit soars beyond the six directions—thus it is said they "wander beyond the four seas."

**Commentary:** Those who embody spirit and abide in numinosity, who exhaust principle and reach the subtlest mysteries—though they rest in stillness within quiet chambers, their profound unity extends beyond the four seas. Thus they ride the Two Modes and harness the Six Qi, harmonize with humankind and guide the myriad things. If nothing fails to accord with them, then floating clouds become their mount; if no form is unborne, then flying dragons become their steed. Forgetting the self to attain self-possession, though serene and ungrasping, seated in oblivion and moving in oblivion, they act through forgetting—thus their movement is like dragging withered wood, their stillness like a heap of dead ashes. This is why it is said their spirit congeals. When their spirit congeals, what does not congeal attains spontaneity. The world all equalizes its views and judges accordingly—how could it ever credit this!

**Exegesis:** "Congeals" means stills. "Pestilence" refers to illness. "The five grains ripen" means a year of abundance. The sage’s form resembles withered wood, their mind like dead ashes; root and trace are one in the moment, movement and stillness both wondrous. Their congealed illumination and hidden penetration, their empty embrace of things—thus do the four seasons follow their sequence, the five grains yield abundance, people know no calamity, and things suffer no premature demise. Such is the sage’s power in dwelling in the world, yet Jian Wu, failing to grasp these ultimate words, dismissed them as madness and refused belief.

**Textual Notes:**
*Lian Shu said, "Indeed."*

The blind have no part in the spectacle of patterns, the deaf no share in the sound of bells and drums. Yet is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? Indeed, understanding too may suffer this. His words are like those of a girl who speaks only in season. Such a person, such virtue—it spreads boundlessly to unify the myriad things, seeking to bring order to the age. Who would exhaust themselves making the world their business? Such a person—nothing harms them. Though great floods reach the heavens, they do not drown; though great droughts melt metal and stone, scorch earth and mountains, they do not burn. Their dust and grime, their dregs—these would mold even Yao and Shun. Who would trouble themselves with things as their concern?

The people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yao governed the people of the world, brought order to the realm’s affairs, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on the distant slopes of Mount Guye by the northern bank of the Fen River, he was suddenly and utterly bereft of his world.

The blind, here, refers to eyes without pupils, dark and sealed like drumskin. The deaf suffer from an affliction of the ears. The sightless have ruined eye faculties. Now, seeing with the eyes and hearing with the ears are the common faculties of beings—yet once blind and deaf, one cannot be shown sounds or colors. It is just the same with the supreme words and wondrous Dao: only those of profound understanding can know them. The foolish and deluded pass their whole lives without awakening, truly because their wisdom is obstructed and benighted, unable to illuminate and perceive. How could this affliction belong to the body alone? Thus, when they heard Jie Yu’s words, they called him mad and did not believe. From here onward is Lian Shu’s reply to Jian Wu.

*Gǔ*: pronounced "gu." The blind have no eyes, like drumskin.
*Yú hū*: Xu pronounces it "yu." The same below.
*Zhī guān*: "guan" as in "luan."
*Lóng*: "long" as in "gong," meaning "unable to hear."
*Zhī shēng*: Cui, Xiang, and Sima’s editions add below: "The dim-sighted have nothing to share in the beauty of brows and eyes; the amputee does not make himself ornamental shoes."
*Fū zhī*: "zhi" as in "wisdom." The note reads "zhi" the same.

【2】【Commentary】This refers to what Jie Yu spoke of—naturally sought by all things—yet those deaf and blind to understanding call it groundless.

【Exegesis】"Is" here serves as a pointed rebuke. "Maiden of the times" refers to a young woman still dwelling in her chamber. What Jie Yu spoke of is like a maiden of deep beauty and serene purity, sought after by the noble-minded—yet those deaf and blind to understanding call it groundless.

【Philological Notes】*Shí nǚ*: Sima explains: "like a maiden." Xiang says: "The maiden of the times is empty, still, gentle, and harmonious, never clamorous; she does not seek others, yet others seek her." ◎Qing Fan’s note: "Shí" means "this." It should be read as "this maiden," meaning "this very woman." The two characters "yóu shí" should be read together. The *Yi Jing* says, "A maiden’s chastity lies in not being betrothed"—here, "maiden" refers to one still in her chamber. Sima’s gloss of *shí nǚ* as "like a maiden" may be mistaken. The *Book of Songs*, "Da Ya · Mian," states: "It is called *shí* (this)," and the commentary explains: "*Shí* means 'this.'" This serves as evidence.

【3】【Commentary】The heart-mind of the sage reaches the ultimate convergence of the Two Modes and exhausts the wondrous principles of the myriad things. Thus, he embodies transformation and harmonizes with change, nowhere unable to go, pervading the ten thousand things without anything not so. The world, in its chaos, seeks me, yet I am without heart-mind. If I am truly without heart-mind, why should I not respond to the world? Therefore, one who embodies the profound and exhausts the wondrous—through which he harmonizes with the natures of the ten thousand things and shapes the transformations of the world to achieve the renown of Yao and Shun—always accomplishes this by acting through non-action. Who would exhaust themselves, straining mind and spirit, making affairs their business, and only then succeed?

【Exegesis】"Zhī" is a particle, also expressing admiration. *Páng bó* means "to merge as one." *Qí* means "to seek." *Shú* means "who." "This man" refers to praising Yao as a sage; "this virtue" refers to praising Yao’s great virtue. The sage’s virtue aligns with the Two Modes, his Dao equal to all beings; he merges with the ten thousand things and governs the hundred spirits. When the world’s ways are decadent and the black-haired people suffer disorder, they seek the great sage to ascend and bring peace. Yet like an empty boat or a suspended mirror, he responds without intent. Who would willingly exhaust their form and weary their wisdom, managing the realm, making affairs their business, and only then succeed? Thus, Laozi says: "Act through non-action, manage through non-affairs," and also: "To take the world, one always does so through non-affairs; if one has affairs, it is insufficient to take the world."

【Philological Notes】*Páng*: pronounced "bó gāng"; Li pronounces it "pū gāng." The character is also written as *páng*, with the same pronunciation.

《Bó》: pronounced "bó bó"; Li pronounces it "pǔ gè." Sima [Qian] says: *páng bó* means "merging as one." ◎Li Zhen states: In the *Records of Sima Xiangru*, it reads "páng pò fills the four bounds," with the annotation: *páng pò* means "widely pervading." *Pò* and *bó* are interchangeable. In the *Records of Yang Xiong*, it reads "páng bó all living beings," with the annotation: *páng bó* means "to pervade and spread." "Pervading and spreading" is the same as "widely pervading." *Páng bó* the ten thousand things—these three characters continue the preceding *virtue*—speaking of how that virtue will widely pervade the ten thousand things. Thus, the world seeks order in chaos. *Luàn* (chaos) means *zhì* (order), just as in the *Book of Yu*, *luàn* is paired with *jìng* (reverence). The whole world longs for governance; virtue holds its tally, and spirit and man leave no trace. How could one willingly leave marks of toil upon the world? Laozi says, "I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves"—this is what it means.

《Shì qí》: Xu pronounces it "qí"; Li says it means "to seek." ◎Lu Wenchang notes: The old text wrote *qí* as *qí*, an error; now corrected following the Song edition.

《Bì bì》: Li pronounces it "fú shì"; Xu pronounces it "fú jì." Emperor Jianwen says: *bì bì* describes the appearance of managing affairs. Sima’s edition writes it as *bì bì*.

《Bù yìng》: *Yìng* as in "response."

《Kǔ sī》: pronounced "xī sì."

【4】【Annotation】If one is at ease with what harms, then harm cannot harm; when harm cannot harm, then things also do not harm it.

【5】【Annotation】With no place one does not find ease, every situation becomes fitting; death and life hold no change for oneself—how much less drowning or burning!

Thus, the perfected person does not entangle himself in calamity and disaster, not by avoiding them, but by advancing straight along principle, naturally meeting with good fortune.

【Exegesis】*Jī* means "to reach." One who comprehends life and death has neither death nor life; one who is fitting in water and fire is neither drowned nor burned.

Should calamities like the "Yang-nine" molten-metal disaster or the "Hundred-six" deluge of heaven arise—tumultuous though they be from their own source—what have they to do with me? Thus Guo’s commentary states: "Death and life hold no change for oneself—how much less drowning or burning!"

【Exegesis】
*Dà jìn*: pronounced *zǐ zhèn*.
*Jī tiān*: pronounced *jī*; Xu and Li read it as *qǐ*. Sima explains: "to reach."
*Bù nì*: pronounced *nú lì*; some read it as *nú xué*.
*Huò nàn*: pronounced *nǎi dàn*.
*Fēi bì*: pronounced *bì*.

【6】【Annotation】
Yao and Shun are but names for worldly affairs; one who is named is not the name itself. Thus, were Yao and Shun truly no more than Yao and Shun? They must possess the reality of the spirit-person. What we now call Yao and Shun merely applies their names to dust and grime.

【Exegesis】
Scattered, it becomes dust; greasy, it becomes grime. Unripe grain is chaff; grain husks are bran—all coarse things. Molten metal is cast; molded clay is fired. By posthumous naming: "Winged in virtue, transmitting sageliness" is Yao; "benevolent, sagely, flourishing, luminous" is Shun. Yao, being supremely sagely, transcends form and name, mingling his traces with the dust, so that beings delight in his power. Thus, a name is established to manifest his sagely essence. Yet names are crude models, no different from chaff or bran; posthumous titles are worldly affairs, what distinction do they hold from dust or grime? Then, with flattery and deceit, they forge that dust and grime into Yao, and mold this chaff and bran into Shun. How could they know the wondrous essence is beyond words! Therefore, who would take external things as their concern?

【Exegesis】
*Chén gòu*: pronounced *gǔ kǒu*, meaning "stained and defiled."
*Bǐ*: the original also writes it as *bǐ*. Xu reads it as *fǔ zhǐ*; others read it as *bēi yǐ*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: According to the *Shuowen*, it is written as *bǐ*.
*Kāng*: the character is also written as *糠*, pronounced *kāng*. Chaff and bran are like trivial fragments.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The old edition writes *糠* as *康*. Now corrected according to the annotated edition. *Kāng* is also a vulgar character. It should say "pronounced *kāng*, the character is also written as *康*," which would be correct. It seems later hands confused it and made an erroneous change. Since *康* already contains the "rice" radical, why add another "rice" component?
*Táo*: pronounced *tú dāo*; Li Yizhao reads it as *yí zhāo*. The original also writes it as *鋾*, same pronunciation.
*Zhù*: pronounced *zhī shù*.

【7】【Exegesis】
This introduces a parable. *Zī* means "goods." The state of Yue, pressed close to rivers and lakes, cuts its hair and tattoos its body to evade the peril of flood dragons. *Zhāng fǔ* is the name of a cap. Thus, Confucius, born in Lu, wore robes with wide sleeves; raised in Song, he wore the *zhāng fǔ* cap. Now, Song was the descendant state of Weizi, and Yue the lineage of Taibo. The two states traded and interacted, making the *zhāng fǔ* a commodity. Yet the *zhāng fǔ*, meant to adorn the head, requires a topknot to bear the cap. The people of Yue, with their shorn hair and tattooed bodies, rendered the goods useless. It is like glory and splendor, which are inherently clinging, while wealth and nobility arise from arrogance. Yao, having embodied the Dao and forgotten all, could thus make no use of the world. Thus Guo’s commentary states: "Yao’s having no use for the world is just like the people of Yue having no use for the *zhāng fǔ* cap."

【Exegesis】
*Song rén*: Song is today’s Suiyang County in Liang State, the fief of Weizi, descendant of the Yin.
*Zī zhāng fǔ*: Li explains: *zī* means "goods"; *zhāng fǔ* is the Yin cap, sold as a commodity.
*Yuè*: today’s Shanyin County in Kuaiji.
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Zhang Jingyang’s "Miscellaneous Poems" cites Sima: "*Zī* means 'to take'; *zhāng fǔ* is the name of a cap." (The same is cited in Ji Shuye’s *Letter Breaking Off Relations with Shan Ju’yuan*.) "All" means "in." The *Exegesis* omits this.
◎ Li Zhen notes: *Zhū Yuè* is like *yú Yuè*. The *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Ding’s fifth year: "The Yu Yue entered Wu." Du’s commentary: "*Yú* is an exclamatory particle." The *Gongyang Commentary*: "Yu Yue—why not use its proper name?" He Xiu’s commentary: "The people of Yue call themselves Yu Yue." Here it is written as *zhū*, as in the *Guangya*: "*Zhū* means 'in.'" The *Li Ji* "She Yi" commentary: "*Zhū* is like 'in.'" This is an alliterative loan character.
*Duàn*: pronounced *dīng guǎn*. Li reads it as *tú duǎn*. Sima’s edition writes it as *dūn*, explaining: "*Dūn* means 'to cut.'"

【8】【Annotation】
Yao’s having no use for the world is just like the people of Yue having no use for the *zhāng fǔ* cap. Yet one who relinquishes the world is surely revered by the world. Though the world reveres Yao, Yao never possessed the world. Thus, though he was profoundly bereft of it, he roamed in mind through the boundless dark, and though he sat as if lodged above the myriad things, he was never not carefree. The Four Masters are but figures of speech, used to show that Yao was not confined to being Yao. In truth, Yao was profoundly dark; his traces were but Yao. Viewing the dark from the traces, inner and outer are different realms—nothing strange in that. The world sees only Yao as Yao; who recognizes his darkness? Thus, seeking the Four Masters beyond the seas while clinging to one’s view of Yao, and claiming that one who flows with things loses their carefree ease—this is to miss the Dao of freedom. Yet one does not know that the farthest traces, when followed, draw nearer, while the highest convergence turns downward. If one rigidly exalts solitude as the ultimate and does not level oneself with worldly entanglements, one is but a mountain-valley scholar, not one who is unconditioned. How could such a one speak of the ultimate or wander the infinite?

【Exegesis】
*Zhì* means "to order and regulate"; *zhèng* means "wind and teaching."

This is a combined metaphor. The Fen River originates in Taiyuan and flows westward into the Yellow River. The northern bank is called *yang*; thus, present-day Pingyang County in Jinzhou, lying north of the Fen River, was once Yao’s capital. *Yaoran* denotes stillness and solitude, a term for profound remoteness. *Sang* means "to forget," signifying liberation and dissolution. As for the Four Masters, they represent the four virtues: first, the root; second, the traces; third, neither root nor traces; and fourth, neither the negation of root nor traces. This speaks of Yao turning inward to illuminate the source of the mind, penetratingly beholding the realm of the Dao, and transcending these four distinctions—hence the saying that he went to meet the Four Masters.

The sage is without fixed mind; responding only when moved, he thus orders and harmonizes the myriad states, bringing peace to the nine lands. Though he concentrates his spirit upon the Four Masters, sitting in solemn stillness at Fenyang, and governs the ten thousand affairs, he remains profoundly forgetful of the world. This is none other than the immediate identity of root and traces, of substance and function, the dual illumination of emptiness and being, the simultaneous arising of movement and stillness. Thus, Mount Guye is no different from Fenyang, and mountain forests are no distinct from the imperial palace! Yet the world equalizes only what it sees—how could it ever believe this?

Yet Ma Biao’s identification of the Four Masters with Nie Que fails to grasp the profound principle, while Liu Zhang’s relocation of the Fen River to Mount Guye only compounds confusion over immediate matters. The present explication thus diverges somewhat from these interpretations.

Hence Guo Xiang’s commentary observes that the Four Masters are but figurative designations, meant to show that Yao was not confined to "Yao"—for the world sees only Yao’s traces, how could it ever perceive his true depth?

**Annotation of Textual Variants:**
*"Four Masters"*—Sima and Li explain: Wang Ni, Nie Que, Pi Yi, and Xu You.
*"Fen River"*—Xu reads *fú*, Guo reads *fén*.
Note: The Fen River rises in Taiyuan; here it is but a parable in Zhuangzi’s discourse. Sima’s and Cui’s editions read "basin water."

◎ Li Zhen remarks: Whether the Guye of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* lies within the borders of Jizhou remains unverifiable in the received text. The *Sui History* assigns it to Linfen, though it may be that later ages, taking this passage’s phrase "north of the Fen River" as a toponym, named the mountains accordingly. The Guye mentioned above lies far in the Northern Sea—hence the text calls it *miǎo*, "distant." The Fen region was Yao’s seat; if Guye were there, why would it also be called *miǎo*? The truth is that Yao’s mind never held the world—his heart was the heart of the Guye transcendent, his body the body of the Guye transcendent. Though he wore the robes of court, he wandered as freely as if beyond the seas. Thus that mountain’s remoteness was no different from its proximity to the imperial capital.

(The Four Masters were never actual persons; to seek historical referents for their names is to force the point.) The commentaries and sub-commentaries expound this with consummate subtlety.

Having previously argued that mountain names must not be conflated, I feared this might obscure Zhuangzi’s profound intent, and so return to the matter for further discussion.

The *Fen River*: The versions of Sima [Biao] and Cui [Zhu] both write it as *Pen River*. In ancient pronunciation, *fen* was read like *pen*—it was not a separate waterway, as Qian Daxin explains in his *Yangxin Lu*.

*Yǎorán* 窅然: Xu [Shen] glosses it with the fanqie 烏了反; Guo [Xiang] with 武騈反. Li [Yi] says: *yǎorán* means the same as *chàngrán* (怅然, "disconsolate").

◎ Lu Wenchong notes: Guo must have taken it as *tián* 窴 (to fill), hence his pronunciation.

*Sàngqí* 丧其: Read *xīlàng* 息浪反, with the same reading in the commentary.

*Juémíng* 绝冥: Read *wángdīng* 亡丁反.

*Zhījìng* 之竟: Read *jìng* 境. The original text also writes it as *jìng* 境.

◎ Lu Wenchong notes: The present commentary writes it as *jìng* 境.

【Collations】
(1) *Quēwù* cites the ancient manuscript from Fangying Temple on Tiantai Mountain: *máng* 盲 is written as *gǔ* 瞽.
(2) The character *suǒ* 所 is amended following the Song edition.
(3) The character *míng* 冥 is amended following the commentary.
(4) The character *tián* 窴 is amended following the *Baojing Tang* original edition.

The original woodblock print also appears to contain errors.

*Shuowen* says: *Tián* 窴 means "to block" or "to fill," from *xué* 穴 ("cavern") and *zhēn* 真 as phonetic. Xu [Shen] reads it as *dàinián* 待年切, equivalent to the modern *tián* 填.

"武骈" shares the same rhyme but belongs to a different rhyme category than "待年," and is likely not the correct character. Using *tián* 窴 to describe the loss of the world is also semantically incoherent. I suspect the original text by Guo [Xiang] wrote *míng* 冥. The *Shiwen* commentary omits the two characters "作冥" after Guo’s name. The character *míng* 冥 was anciently interchangeable with *míng* 瞑 and *mián* 眠. In the *Lie Yukou* chapter, it reads, "甘冥乎无何有之乡," and the *Shiwen* notes: "本又作瞑, 音眠." Yu Yue observes that the *Chuzhen* chapter of the *Huainanzi*—"甘瞑乎溷澖之域"—is derived from this passage, where "甘瞑" means "甘眠." The *Shuowen* states: "瞑, 翕目也, 从目冥, 冥亦声." Xu Xuan comments: "In modern usage, it is incorrectly written as 眠." The pronunciation is *wǔyán* 武延切. In the *Hanshu* (*Biography of Yang Xiong*), it reads, "目冥眴而无见," where "冥眴" is equivalent to "瞑眩" in the *Mencius* (*Teng Wen Gong*). These are all rhyming binomes. Alternate forms include "眩眠" or "眩愍," as seen in the *Shiji* (*Biography of Sima Xiangru*): "视眩眠而无见兮" and "红杳渺而眩愍兮." All these characters share similar meanings and sounds. Lu Deming’s *Qieyun* reads *míng* 冥 as *wǔpián* 武骈切, while Xu Xuan’s *Shuowen* reads *míng* 瞑 as *wǔyán* 武延切. The *Hanshu* commentary by Yan [Shigu] reads *míng* 冥 as *mòjiàn* 莫见反, and Sun Shi’s *Mengzi Yinyi* reads *míng* 瞑 as *mòdiàn* 莫甸切. The *Shiji Suoyin* cites Su Lin’s reading of *mǐn* 愍. All share the same rhyme category (ancient Chinese lacked labiodental sounds, so *wǔ* 武 and *mò* 莫 were homophonous), differing only in tone. *Míng* 冥 and *yǎo* 窅 are also semantically connected, hence their frequent pairing. In the *Xiaoyaoyou* chapter, it reads, "北冥有鱼," and the *Shiwen* cites Jian Wen’s commentary: "窅冥无极, 故谓之冥." The two characters are also graphically similar, which is why the modern text writes *yǎo* 窅 while Guo’s version writes *míng* 冥. In his commentary here, Guo repeatedly uses the character *míng* 冥, all in the sense of "冥然," providing definitive evidence. The *yǎo* 窅 in the preceding phrase—"故窅然丧之"—was likely originally *míng* 冥 as well, later altered by copyists to match the modern text.

Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi: "The King of Wei bestowed upon me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and when they bore fruit, it held five *shi*. When I used it to contain water or broth, its fragility prevented it from supporting its own weight. When I split it to make ladles, its shallowness left nothing to hold. It was not that it was not vast and hollow—yet I smashed it for its uselessness."

---

**Annotations:**
1. **Commentary:** Hui Shi’s surname was Hui, given name Shi, a native of Song who served as Prime Minister of Liang. "V谓" means "spoke to." "贻" means "bestowed." "瓠" refers to a type of gourd. The King of Wei was King Hui of Liang. Formerly residing in Anyi, his state was called Wei. Later, pressured by the powerful state of Qin, he relocated to Daliang and renamed his state Liang, usurping the title of king. Hui Shi introduced this parable of the great gourd to satirize Zhuangzi’s writings, which, though grand in scope, failed to address practical matters. This exchange was intended to provoke further discussion.

   **Shiwen:** *Hui Shi*: Sima [Biao] states: His surname was Hui, given name Shi, and he served as Prime Minister of Liang. *King of Wei*: Sima [Biao] states: King Hui of Liang. Since Wei relocated from Hedong to Daliang, it was also called Liang. *贻*: Xu [Shen] reads it as *yí* 怡; Guo [Xiang] and [Li] Zhi read it as *zhì* 志—both mean "to bestow." *大瓠*: Xu [Shen] reads it as *hù* 护. *之种*: Read as *zhǒng* 种, *zhāngyǒng* 章勇反.

2. **Commentary:** "树" means "to cultivate." "实" refers to the fruit. After Hui Shi obtained the gourd seeds and cultivated them to maturity, the fruit grew so large it could hold five *shi*. Yet when he used it to contain liquids, its fragility prevented it from supporting its own weight.

   **Shiwen:** *而实五石*: Sima [Biao] states: The fruit could hold five *shi*. *以盛*: Read as *chéng* 盛.

3. **Commentary:** "剖" means "to split." "瓢" means "ladle." "瓠落" means "shallow and flat." "呺然" means "vast and hollow." "掊" means "to smash." Though it could hold liquids, its fragility made it unable to support its own weight. When split into ladles, its shallowness left nothing to contain. Deemed useless, it was smashed and discarded. This satirizes Zhuangzi’s words, which, like this gourd, fail to address the needs of the times and should be discarded.

   **Shiwen:** *剖之*: Read as *pǒu* 剖, *pǔkǒu* 普口反. *为瓢*: Read as *piáo* 瓢, *píyáo* 毗遥反 (Xu [Shen] reads it as *fúyáo* 扶尧反). *则瓠*: Read as *hù* 瓠, *hùguǒ* 户郭反 (Sima [Biao] reads it as *hù* 护; the same below). *落*: Jian Wen states: "瓠落" means "廓落" (spacious and empty). Sima [Biao] states: "瓠" means "布护" (to spread and protect); "落" means "零落" (scattered and fallen). This describes its shape as flat and shallow, unable to retain water. *呺然*: Also written as *枵然*. Xu [Shen] reads it as *xūjiāo* 许憍反. Li [Yi] states: It describes a vast and hollow appearance. Cui [Yuan] writes it as *□* (same as Jian Wen). *吾为*: Read as *wéi* 为, *yúwěi* 于伪反. *掊之*: Xu [Shen] reads it as *fánggòu* 方垢反. Sima [Biao] states: It means "to strike and break."

   **Qingfan’s Note:** The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Xie Lingyun’s poem *Departing the Capital for My Prefecture* cites Sima [Biao]: "瓠 means '布护' (to spread and protect); '落' means '零落' (scattered and fallen). '枵然' means vast. '掊' means to strike and break. This metaphorically describes Zhuangzi’s words as vast but impractical, like a giant gourd with no use." This is more detailed than the *Shiwen* citation.

   **Yu Yue’s Note:** The *Shuowen* states: "呺, 痛声也." The characters *呺* and *□* do not appear in the *Shuowen* and are likely vulgar variants of *枵*. Applied here, they make no semantic sense. The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Xie Lingyun’s *Departing the Capital* cites this passage as *枵然*, which should be followed. The *Erya* (*Explaining Heaven*) states: "玄枵 means '虚' (empty)." Emptiness implies vastness, hence "枵然大也." The *Shiwen* cites Li [Yi]’s note: "然, 虚大貌," which aligns with the meaning of *枵*.

Zhuangzi replied: "You are indeed inept at putting great things to use. There was a man from Song skilled in making a salve that prevented chapped hands. His family had long been engaged in the business of washing silk floss..."

The visitor, having heard of this, offered to buy the formula for a hundred pieces of gold. The man gathered his clan to deliberate: "Our family has washed silk floss for generations, earning no more than a few pieces of gold. Now, in a single morning, we could sell this skill for a hundred pieces of gold—let us give it to him."

The visitor obtained the formula and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue posed a threat, the King of Wu appointed him as a general. That winter, he engaged the Yue forces in a naval battle, decisively defeating them, and was granted land as a fief. The same salve that prevented chapped hands led one man to a noble title, while another remained bound to washing silk floss—such is the difference in how it was used.

Now, you possess a gourd of five *dan* capacity—why not consider fashioning it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes, instead of fretting that its hollowness leaves it with no place to hold anything? Truly, your heart is still as tangled as mugwort!

The *Shiwen* glosses:
《龟手》: *guǐbēi* (Kuì-bēi), Xu Juelun reads *jǔlún*, Li Juwei reads *jūwēi*. Xiang Xiu says: "chapped and cracked." Sima Biao says: "cracked like the pattern of a tortoise shell," and also: "like a tortoise’s contracted limbs." ◎ Yu Yue remarks: The *Shiwen* cites Sima Biao’s "cracked like the pattern of a tortoise shell" and "like a tortoise’s contracted limbs," but neither interpretation is satisfactory. Xiang Xiu’s "like chapped and cracked" and Guo Xiang’s note "able to keep the hands from chapping and cracking" suggest that *guī* (龟) should be read as *jū* (拘). The word *guī* has a *qiū* (丘) sound, as in the *Hou Hanshu*’s *Xiyu Zhuan*, where *Qiūcí* (龟兹) is read as *Qiūcí* (丘慈). The ancient *qiū* sound is the same as *qū* (区), and thus may also be read as *jū* (拘). *Jū* means "contracted and cramped," so *bù guī* (不龟) means "not contracted and cramped." While the "tortoise-shell pattern" interpretation is incorrect, the "contracted limbs" interpretation is valid—though it need not be explained as "like a tortoise." ◎ Li Zhen says: *Guīshǒu* (龟手), as the *Shiwen* notes, Xu Juelun reads it with the *jǔlún* pronunciation, likely treating *guī* as a loan for *jūn* (皲). *Guī* and *jūn* are homophonous. The *Zhongjing Yinyi* (Vol. 11) gives *jūn* as *jūyún* or *qùyún*. The *Tongsu Wen* states: "chapping and cracking of hands and feet is called *jūn*." Classical texts sometimes write it as *guīchè* (龟坼). Below, it cites this passage from Zhuangzi and Guo Xiang’s note as evidence. Thus, Xuanying treats *guī* and *jūn* as interchangeable in sound and meaning. The *Jiyun* (Vol. 18, *zhūn*): *jūn*, *qūlún* cut, meaning "chapped." The *Hanshu*’s *Zhao Chongguo Zhuan* states: "The general’s soldiers suffered from cold, their hands and feet chapped and frostbitten." Wen Ying explains: "*Jūn* means chapped and cracked; *zhú* means cold sores." The *Tangshu*’s *Li Gan Zhuan* says: "Frostbitten skin, chapped and cracked." Thus, *bù guīshǒu* (不龟手) simply means "hands that do not chap." *Jūn* is written as *□* in the *Shuowen*. Niu Shuyu and Zheng Zhen argue that the variant *□* under *yùn* (韗) is the character *jūn*, but this is unfounded.
《洴》: Xu reads *fújīng*; 《澼》: *pǔlì*, Xu reads *fūlì*. Guo and Li read *kèlì*, noting that *pì* (澼) is the sound. ◎ Lu Wenchang remarks: In the current text, it reads *pìshēng* (澼声), suggesting that *píngpì* (洴澼) is the sound of beating silk floss. The two characters *píngpì* are alliterative, likely imitating the sound.
《絖》: pronounced *kuàng*. The *Xiao Erya* states: "Fine silk floss is called *kuàng*." Li Yi says: "*Píngpì kuàng* means washing silk floss in water. *Kuàng* refers to the floss."
《能令》: *lìchéng* (Li-cheng) cut.
《不拘》: *jìyú* (Ji-yu) cut. The proper character should be *jū* (), with readings *jìyú* and *qiúyú*. The *Zhoushu* says: "In cold weather, feet *jū* ()"—this is the same.
《坼》: *chìbái* (Chi-bai) cut. ◎ Lu Wenchang remarks: In vulgar editions, *chè* (坼) is often written with the "hand" radical, which is incorrect.
《漂》: *pǐmiào* (Pi-miao), Wei Zhao says: "Beating silk floss in water is called *piāo* (漂)." The *Shuowen* writes it as *piē* (潎), with readings *fēngshì* and *pǐlì*. ◎ Lu Wenchang remarks: The character *piē* (潎) was formerly miswritten as *bì* (敝); this has now been corrected.
《絮》: *xūlǜ* (Xu-lü) cut.

【二】 The *Shu* notes: "One *jin* of gold is a square inch weighing one *jin*. A traveler from another state happened to hear of it and offered to buy the formula for chapped hands, spending a hundred *jin* of gold for it."
The *Shiwen* glosses: 《百金》: Li Yi says: "A square inch of gold weighing one *jin* is called one *jin* of gold. A hundred *jin* means a hundred *jin* in weight."

【三】 The *Shu* notes: *Yù* (鬻) means "to sell." With such a high valuation, the family gathered to deliberate. For generations, they had washed silk floss, gaining little profit, but selling the formula in a single morning would bring vast wealth. With one voice, they agreed to give it away.
The *Shiwen* glosses: 《数金》: *sèzhǔ* (Se-zhu) cut. 《鬻》: *yù* (Yu), Sima Biao says: "to sell." 《技》: Some early editions write it as *jì* (伎), *jiébǐ* (Jie-bi) cut.

【四】 The *Shu* notes: Wu and Yue were neighboring states, their lands bordering rivers and seas, and their conflicts fought with warships. In the depths of winter, soldiers’ hands often chapped and cracked. The visitor, endowed with heroic talent and innate wisdom, obtained the formula and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue threatened invasion, the King of Wu appointed him as a general. Relying on this miraculous salve, his soldiers’ hands did not chap. As soon as the banners were raised, the Yue forces fell into disarray. Achieving a great victory, he returned in triumph, his merit renowned, and was granted land as a fief.
The *Shiwen* glosses: 《以说》: *shǐruì* (Shi-rui) cut, or read as the common word. 《有难》: *nǎidàn* (Nai-dan) cut. 《之将》: *zǐjiàng* (Zi-jiang) cut. 《大败》: *bìmài* (Bi-mai) cut.

【五】 The *Shu* notes: *Huò* (或) indicates uncertainty. The formula itself was neither refined nor crude, but its use differed. Thus, the traveler gained it and was enfeoffed, while the Song man used it to wash silk floss—this is the difference in skillful and unskillful application.

【六】 The *Zhu* notes: *Péng* (蓬) is not a plant that grows straight. This chapter shows that things each have their proper use; if one finds the right application, how can one not be carefree?
The *Shu* notes: *Lǜ* (虑) means "to bind with ropes." *Zūn* (樽) refers to a vessel lacquered like a wine container, bound with ropes, used to cross rivers and lakes—what the southerners call a "waist boat." *Péng* (蓬) is the name of a plant, crooked and not straight. *Fū* (夫) is an exclamation. A great gourd, floating on rivers and lakes, can serve as a boat to navigate the waves; the profound teachings, when practiced in the world, can ferry the deluded across. Yet Huizi, his heart still tangled like mugwort, failed to grasp the abstruse principle and rashly raised the analogy of smashing the gourd, mocking Zhuangzi’s writings. Such misuse is deeply lamentable.
The *Shiwen* glosses: 《不虑以为大樽》: Some early editions write it as *zūn* (尊). Sima Biao says: "*Zūn* is like a wine vessel, bound to the body and floated on rivers and lakes to cross them." *Lǜ* means "to bind and fasten," referring to what is called a "waist boat." ◎ Lu Wenchang remarks: The character *fù* (缚) was formerly written as *fù* (缚); this has now been corrected following the Song edition. 《蓬之心》: Guo Xiang says: "*Péng* is a plant that does not grow straight."

Earlier it was said: "*Péng* is short and not straight, referring to the crooked scholar." ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The character *shì* (士) was formerly mistaken as *tǔ* (土); it has now been corrected.

【Collation Notes】
(1) *Quēwù* cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript, which includes the character *yǐ* (以) after *fāng* (方).
(2) The character *guī* (龟) is supplied following *Zhūzǐ Píngyì*.
(3) The character *zhuō* (拙) is supplied in accordance with the following text.
(4) Lu’s assertion is incorrect. *Shuōwén* states: "*Fù* (缚) means to bind." *Fù* (缚) refers to the pale color of *báixiān*; Duan’s commentary emends *sè* (色) to *zhī* (卮), noting that *Shēnglèi* takes it as the modern standard character for *juàn* (绢). According to Xu Shen, however, *fù* and *juàn* are distinct things. In *Yuèrén shí tuán wéi fù* and *Zuǒzhuàn*’s "*fù yī rú tiàn*," the term consistently denotes "wrapping" or "binding," not the original meaning of the character. Zhu Huan’s *Jiǎjiè Yìzhèng* argues that *fù* (缚) and *fù* (缚) are phonetically distinct, suggesting the error arose from graphic similarity—his reasoning is sound. Thus, the character for "binding" should properly be written as *fù* (缚), while the Song edition is mistaken.

Huizi said to Zhuangzi: "I have a great tree, which people call the *chū*. Its massive trunk is gnarled and does not conform to the carpenter’s line; its slender branches are twisted and do not meet the compass or square. Even if planted by the roadside, no craftsman would glance at it. Now, your words are grand but useless—just as the multitude would discard them."

The annotations state:
[1] *Chū* (樗) belongs to the same category as *kǎo* and *qī*—its scent is foul, and it is deemed a worthless tree. Worldly names are all empty and false; when people call it *chū*, they do so without knowing its true nature.

*Explanation of Characters*:
*Chū* (樗): pronounced *chìyú* (敕鱼) in reverse, the name of a tree.

[2] *Yōngzhǒng* (拥肿) means "knotted and swollen." *Juǎnqū* (卷曲) means "not straight." The compass draws circles, and the square marks right angles. *Tú* (涂) means "road." The *chū* and *kǎo* are useless trees: their roots are knotted and swollen, their branches and trunks twisted and curled. They do not meet the carpenter’s line, nor do they conform to square or compass. Planted by the roadside, craftsmen do not even glance at them.

*Explanation of Characters*:
*Yōngzhǒng* (拥肿): pronounced *zhāngyǒng* (章勇) in reverse. Li [Yi] says: *yōngzhǒng* is like *pányǐng* (盘瘿, "knotted swelling").
*Bù zhòng* (不中): pronounced *dīngzhòng* (丁仲) in reverse. The same applies below.
*Juǎnqū* (卷曲): also written as *quán* (拳), pronounced identically. Pronounced *quán* (权), or in Xu’s reading, *jǐquǎn* (纪阮) in reverse. Li [Yi] reads it as *qiūyuán* (丘圆).

[3] Just as the tree is knotted and useless, so that craftsmen ignore it, so too are words (or deeds) grand but impractical, shunned by all. This is the matching analogy.

*Explanation of Characters*:
*Tóng qù* (同去): read as written. Li [Yi] reads it as *qiānglǚ* (羌吕) in reverse.
◎ Qingfan’s note: "Grand but useless" means "distant and irrelevant to practical matters." In the *Rites*, *Wénwáng Shìzǐ* says: "Would one apply [the principle] to oneself to benefit one’s lord?" Zheng’s commentary reads: *yú* (于) as *yū* (迂), meaning "broad" or "grand." Thus, *grand* and *distant* share the same sense. The *Laozi*’s *Daodejing* says: "All under heaven say the Dao is grand but seems unworthy"—this is the same meaning of *grand*. Zhuangzi said: "Have you alone not seen the wildcat? It crouches low to lie in wait for its prey, leaping east and west, heedless of height or depth..."

Amidst snares and traps it meets its end, perishing in nets and toils. Now consider the yak: vast as clouds trailing across the sky. This creature attains greatness indeed, yet cannot seize a mouse. You possess a great tree and fret over its uselessness—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the boundless wilds? Wander idly at its side, roam freely beneath its shade. Unfelled by axes, untouched by harm, devoid of use—where then lies its distress?

---

**Annotations from Commentaries:**
The *shēng* (狌) is a wildcat. *Tiàoliáng* (跳梁) means to leap and bound; *bì* (辟) refers to mechanisms like traps. *Wǎnggǔ* (罔罟) are hunting nets. Have you not seen how the wildcat hunts mice? It crouches low, lying in wait for careless prey; leaping east and west, heedless of height or depth—only to be ensnared in traps, dying in nets. All for the lure of petty gains, neglecting greater concerns. This mirrors those who bow and scrape, clutching at sacred traces, feigning virtue to seize fleeting advantage. Though they may prosper briefly, ruin follows—just as Shang Yang and Su Qin met their ends. What difference is there between such men and the wildcat dying in nets?

The yak, or *máoniú* (旄牛), hails from the southwestern frontier. Its form looms vast as clouds on the horizon. Though it roams marshes in carefree ease, it cannot match the wildcat in pouncing on mice. So too does Zhuangzi’s teaching warn: to shun the tides of convention is to govern the state and cultivate the self, enduring long and unharmed.

*Wúhéyǒu* (无何有) means "nothing whatever." *Mò* (莫) signifies "none." This is a realm of vast emptiness, where no thing exists—hence the "land of Nothing Whatever."

*Fǎnghuáng* (彷徨) denotes unconstrained wandering; *xiāoyáo* (逍遥), carefree ease. Though differing in name, their meaning converges. A useless tree, its branches lush and sheltering, casts cooling shade, drawing travelers to linger, rest, and sleep beneath. So too does Zhuangzi’s teaching of effortless serenity offer refuge to all beings.

For things great and small, if they stray from their proper measure, the logic of harm and benefit remains the same. When each finds its rightful place, all may roam freely. A gnarled, misshapen tree, deemed worthless by carpenters, escapes the axe’s bite. How then could it suffer an untimely end? In its uselessness lies its salvation—where is its distress? So too does Zhuangzi’s teaching of defying convention preserve the self, safeguarding life’s integrity, sparing one from the world’s snares and the burdens of existence.

**Chapter One, Inner Chapters: "On the Equality of Things" (Second) [1]**

**[1] [Commentary]**
All things deem themselves right and others wrong, praise themselves and despise others—none are exempt. Yet though right and wrong differ, self and other remain equal.

**[Text]**
Nanguo Ziqi leaned against his armrest and sat, gazing upward to exhale a sigh, his bearing as though he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, "What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the mind like dead ashes? The one who now leans against the armrest is not the same as the one who did so before."

**[1] [Commentary]**
In harmony with Heaven and humanity, equalizing self and other, he finds no external cause for joy. Thus, his form dissolves in ease, as if he had lost his match.

**[Annotation]**
Nanguo Ziqi was the younger half-brother of King Zhao of Chu and served as Minister of War under King Zhuang of Chu. His courtesy name was Ziqi. In ancient times, people of simple virtue often took their place of residence as their epithet. Living in the southern outskirts, he was called Nanguo, much like Shinan Yiliao or Dongguo Shunzi. A man who embraced the Dao and held virtue, emptying his mind and forgetting desire, Zhuangzi admired his purity and made him the first subject of discussion.

*Yin* means to lean; *xu*, to sigh. *Dayan* describes a state of release. *Ou* means a pair—here, body and spirit as a pair, self and things as counterparts. Ziqi, leaning against his armrest in seated oblivion, concentrated his spirit in distant contemplation. Gazing upward, he sighed, awakening to the natural, shedding form and discarding knowledge. His body dissolved in ease, both self and things forgotten together, as though he had lost his counterpart.

**[Philological Notes]**
*Nanguo Ziqi*: Pronounced *Qi*. Sima Biao notes: He lived in the southern outskirts, hence his epithet.
*Yin*: Pronounced *yìnjìn*, meaning to lean.
*Ji*: Pronounced *jǐ*. Li’s edition writes *几* (small table).
*Er xu*: Pronounced *xū*, meaning to exhale. Xiang Xiu says: "To breathe."
*Dayan*: Also written *嗒*. Pronounced *tàn* or *dūnà*. The commentary reads: "A state of bodily release." Lu Wenchang notes: The current text writes *嗒*. The phrase "release of the body" aligns with Zhao Qi’s annotation of *Mencius*, referring to relaxed limbs.
*Qi ou*: Also written *偶*. Pronounced *ǒu*, meaning a match or counterpart. Sima Biao says: "*Ou* refers to the body; body and spirit form a pair." Yu Yue notes: "Losing one’s *ou* is what the text below calls ‘I have lost my self.’ Guo Xiang’s commentary, ‘as if he had lost his match,’ does not fully capture the meaning of ‘losing the self.’ Sima Biao’s interpretation, ‘*ou* means the body,’ is correct, though his further claim that ‘body and spirit form a pair’ is mistaken. *Ou* should be read as *寓* (*yù*), meaning ‘to lodge.’ The spirit lodges in the body, so the body is called *寓*."

**[2] [Commentary]**
"Dead ashes" and "withered wood" are used to describe a state of utter quiescence. For one who follows nature and forgets right and wrong, the body alone embodies the uncarved truth—what else could there be? Thus, in stillness, he stands like a withered tree; in motion, he moves like a dry branch. Seated, he is like dead ashes; walking, like drifting dust. I cannot unify his demeanor in movement and rest, nor can I distinguish his state of effortless self-possession.

**[Annotation]**
Yan was the surname, Yan the given name, and Ziyou the courtesy name. *Ju* means to dwell. Eager to seek instruction, he rose and stood in attendance. How could one dwell in such a way that the body becomes indistinguishable from withered wood and the mind from dead ashes? There must be a wondrous method—he asked to be shown the way.

**[Philological Notes]**
*Yan Cheng Ziyou*: Li notes: A disciple of Ziqi, surnamed Yan, given name Yan, posthumously named Cheng, courtesy name Ziyou.
*He ju*: Read as written or pronounced *jī*. Sima Biao says: "Equivalent to ‘why.’"
*Gaomu*: Pronounced *gǎomù*. The commentary shares this pronunciation.
*□*: Pronounced *jì*. Also written *寂*. Lu Wenchang notes: *□* was formerly miswritten as *家*. Referring to *The Great and Venerable Master*, where the text reads "his bearing *□*," the *Shiwen* notes: "Also written *寂*. Cui’s edition writes *□*." The correction is based on this. *Fangyan* states: "*□* means tranquil." Many Han dynasty steles use this character, such as the *Laozi Inscription*: "Revealing the pure *□* of emptiness and nothingness"; the *Zhang Gong Divine Stele*: "Strong boundaries *□* and still"; the *Chenggao Magistrate Ren Boshi Stele*: "The court *□* and still"; the *Prefect of Ba Commandery Zhang Na Stele*: "The four borders *□* and serene"; and the *Prefect of Boling Kong Bin Stele*: "*□* and dark." All use this form. The commentary here writes *寂寞*.
*Mo*: Also written *漠*.

**[3] [Commentary]**
Ziyou had seen one who leaned against the armrest before, but never one like Ziqi.

**[Annotation]**
Ziyou had previously witnessed seated oblivion but had not fully grasped its profundity. Now, encountering one who leaned against the armrest, he found it truly different from before. Marveling at Ziqi’s serene indifference, he expressed his astonishment and doubt.

**[Collations]**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition omits the character *解*.
(2) The character *为* is supplied following the example of the preceding sentence.
(3) *□莫*: The Zhao edition writes *寂漠*; the Shidetang edition writes *寂寞*.
(4) *其于无心而自得*: The Zhao edition writes *无心自得*.
(5) *二也*: The Shidetang edition writes *一也*.

The Zhao edition also writes *一* for *二*, and neither character is followed by *也* in either sentence. (6) The Shidetang edition writes *常* for *尝* and includes the character *见*.

Ziqi said, "Yan, is it not excellent that you ask this! Now I have lost my self—do you understand? (1) You have heard the human *lai* but not the earthly *lai*; you have heard the earthly *lai* but not the heavenly *lai*! (2)"

(1) [Commentary]
"Lost my self": I have forgotten myself. Having forgotten myself, what thing in the world is worth recognizing? Thus, forgetting both external and internal, one transcends and attains all.

[Annotation]
*而* means "you." *丧* means "to forget." Approving of the question, he says, "Is it not excellent?" Yet Ziqi has forgotten both state and knowledge, severed both self and things, while Ziyou remains unenlightened and expresses astonishment. Therefore, he demonstrates the power of leaning against the armrest, asking, "Do you understand?"

(2) [Commentary]
*Lai* means "flute." Flutes vary in length, and their notes differ in pitch, producing sounds of myriad differences—short and long, high and low. Though the sounds differ, the measure from which they arise is one. Thus, there is no distinction of superior or inferior among them. Extending this to the winds and things, though their sounds differ, they are the same in essence, each taking form of its own accord. In this way, the *lai* of heaven and earth is revealed.

[Annotation]
The human *lai* is the flute, twelve inches long, with sixteen pipes, resembling a phoenix’s wing, created by Shun. Flutes vary in length, each receiving its due, just as the winds and things all partake of spontaneity. Thus, these two worthies are invoked to illustrate the meaning of the three *lai*, which is explained below.

[Phonetic Glosses]
*女闻* is read as *汝*. The same applies below. The original also writes *汝*.
◎ Lu Wenchang asks: Why does the first *汝* not uniformly use *女*?
*人籁* is read as *lì dài*.
*籁夫* is read as *lài fú*.
*参* is read as *cēn*.
*差* is read as *cī*.
*所错* is read as *suǒ cuò*.
*见矣* is read as *xiàn yǐ*.

[Collations]
(1) The character *人* is deleted following the commentary.

Ziyou said, "May I ask about its method? (1)"

(1) [Annotation]
*方* means "the Daoist art." Though he has heard the names, he does not grasp their meaning, so he asks about the method of the three *lai*.

Ziqi said, "The great clod exhales *qi*, and its name is wind. (1) It alone does nothing, but when it acts, the myriad hollows roar. (2) Have you alone not heard its long sighing? (3) The towering forests and jagged cliffs, (4) the hollows of great trees a hundred spans around—resembling noses, mouths, ears, beams, rings, mortars, depressions, and puddles; (5) some rushing, some whistling, some scolding, some inhaling, some crying, some wailing, some moaning, some biting—(6) the first sings *yu*, and the followers sing *yong*. A gentle breeze yields a small harmony; a whirlwind, a great harmony. (7) When the fierce wind subsides, all hollows become empty. (8) Have you alone not seen their quivering, their fluttering? (9)"

(1) [Commentary]
The "great clod" is nothingness. As for exhaling *qi*, how could there be a thing? *Qi* simply exhales of itself. The arising of things—none does not arise of itself. Thus, the body of self-arising is vast, and so it is named the "great clod."

[Annotation]
The "great clod" is the name of the Creator, also called spontaneity. The principle of spontaneity gives life to the myriad things, yet it does not know why it is so. Within the great clod, *qi* is exhaled and called wind.

[Phonetic Glosses]
*大块* is read as *kǔ guài* (Li: *kǔ duì*; *Shuowen* agrees, calling it a vulgar character). Xu: *kǒu huí*; Xu and Li also read *hú zuì*; Guo also reads *kǔ wěi*. Sima says: "The appearance of great simplicity." Some versions write *大槐*; Ban Gu’s version is the same. The *Huainanzi* writes *大昧*. Some commentators take it as "nothingness," some as "primordial *qi*," some as "chaotic wholeness," some as "heaven"—all are mistaken.
◎ Qing Fan’s case: The *Yiqiejing yin yi* (95), citing the *Zhengwu jing* (5), quotes Sima as saying, "The great clod is heaven," differing from the *Shiwen*.
◎ Yu Yue says: The "great clod" is earth. *块* is an alternate form of *之*. The *Shuowen* (Earth section): "，a clod." It refers to what the *Zhongyong* calls "a handful of earth," which, when accumulated to vastness, becomes earth. Thus, earth is called the "great clod." Sima’s "appearance of great simplicity" and Guo’s "the great clod is nothingness" both miss the meaning. This passage originally explains the earthly *lai*, so how could the "great clod" be anything but earth?
*噫* is read as *yì jiè*. The commentary is the same.

(1) *Yīn* is pronounced as *yīn*.

(2) **Commentary:** It speaks of wind as having no deliberate action; when it acts, the myriad hollows all rage and stir to produce sound.
**Subcommentary:** *Is* refers to this wind. *Acts* means arises. It says this great wind only remains still; if it moves and acts, then the myriad distinct hollows all drum and roar in fury.
**Pronunciation Notes:** *Myriad hollows* (*wàn qiào*): *kǔ diào* (苦吊) reflex. *Rage and roar* (*nù xiāo*): *hú dāo* (胡刀) reflex; Xu’s version reads *xǔ kǒu* (許口) reflex, also *hú dào* (胡到) reflex.

(3) **Commentary:** The sound of a long wind.
**Pronunciation Notes:** *Liùliù* (翏翏): *liáng jiù* (良救) reflex, also *liù shōu* (六收) reflex. The sound of a long wind. Li’s edition writes *liù* (飂), same pronunciation. Also *lì zhú* (力竹) reflex.

(4) **Commentary:** What the great wind fans and stirs.
**Subcommentary:** *Liùliù* is the sound of a long wind. *Wèi jiā* (畏佳) is the appearance of being fanned and stirred. As the *liùliù* clear gusts strike and shake the mountains and forests, they cause the trees’ branches to sway and flutter in *wèi jiā* agitation. All the world sees this—how could you alone not hear it? The following text states...

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Wèi* (畏): *yú guǐ* reflex. Guo’s version reads *wū zuì* reflex. Cui’s edition writes *wēi*. *Jiā* (佳): *zuì guǐ* reflex. Xu’s version reads *zǐ wéi* reflex. Guo’s version reads *zǔ zuì* reflex. Li’s version reads *zhū guǐ* reflex. Li Yi states: *wèi zhūi* is the appearance of mountains and hills. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: *Jiā* was originally written as *zhūi*; modern editions of the *Zhuangzi* all use *jiā*. The *Yunhui* under the *zhi* rhyme cites this passage, suggesting it may also be read as *zhuī*. Though the pronunciations here (though all level tones) differ, they are in fact close to the original sound of *jiā*, and thus the text has been emended following the majority of editions.

(5) **Commentary:** This briefly enumerates the likenesses of the various apertures.
**Subcommentary:** Apertures are holes in trees. *Jī* are the wooden blocks atop pillars—what we now call *dou*. *Quān* are animal enclosures. Trees being a hundred spans in girth, their cavities are likewise numerous and strange. Thus some resemble human mouths or noses, some resemble animal pens, some resemble human earholes, some resemble the *jī* of a house, some are hollowed and swollen, and some are sunken and uneven. Their forms are endless; this merely lists eight examples. It is just as in the world, where the myriad things, though of different kinds, may be ugly or beautiful—all receive this from the workings of creation.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Zhī qiào* (之窍): Cui’s edition writes *kuǎn*. *Sì bí sì kǒu* (似鼻似口): Sima states: This refers to the apertures being stirred by the wind, resembling either a human nose or a human mouth. *Sì jī* (似枅): *jī* reflex, also *jiān* reflex. The *Zilin* states: The square timber atop a pillar. Simplification states: The *bolu*. *Sì quān* (似圈): *qǐ quán* reflex. Guo’s version reads *quán*, meaning a cup or ring. Xu’s version reads *qí ruǎn* reflex, referring to the enclosures for sheep and pigs. *Sì jiù* (似臼): *qí jiǔ* reflex. *Wā zhě* (洼者): *wū xié* reflex. Li’s version reads *yú huā* reflex, also *wū guāi* reflex. Guo’s version reads *wū wā* reflex. Sima states: Like something hollowed and curved. *Wū zhě* (污者): *wū* reflex. Sima states: Like something sunken and low.

(6) **Commentary:** This briefly enumerates the differing sounds of the various apertures.
**Subcommentary:** *Jī* is like the sound of rushing water. *Hè* is like the sound of an arrow’s shaft-hole. *Chì* is a sharp shout. *Xī* is like the sound of breathing. *Jiào* is like a cry. *Háo* is like a wail. *Yǎo* is deep, like a deep valley. *Yǎo* is a mournful, plaintive sound. Briefly listing the tree’s apertures yields eight kinds; when the wind blows through the tree’s holes, it likewise produces eight sounds. It is just as humans, though differing in endowment, vary in myriad ways—each moves according to its nature, yet all are equal. Even if one considers differences in size, premature death, or longevity, these are not enough to create disparity.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Jī zhě* (激者): *jīng lì* reflex, like the rushing of water. Li’s version reads *gǔ diào* reflex. Sima states: A sound like an urgent call. Li’s version also reads *qū diào* reflex. ◎ Qingfan notes: The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* (68) cites Sima as saying: "Flowing swiftly is called *jī*." The *Yinjing Lüyi Xiang* (14, 78, 90) and the *Gaoseng Zhuan* (13) all concur. The *Wenxuan* (Lu Ziliang’s *Shixing* poem annotation) and the *Xuanying Zongjing Yinyi* (14) also agree, differing from the *Shiwen* citation. *Hè zhě* (謞者): *xiào* reflex. Li’s version reads *xū jiāo* reflex. Simplification states: Like the sound of an arrow’s flight. Sima states: Like the sound of *huān hè*. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Originally read as *kǎo*, an error. The modern commentary reads *xiào*, which is followed here. *Chì zhě* (叱者): *chāng shí* reflex. Xu’s version reads *qī* reflex. Sima states: Like a sharp shout. *Xī zhě* (吸者): *xǔ jí* reflex. Sima states: Like the sound of exhalation and inhalation. *Jiào zhě* (叫者): *gǔ diào* reflex. Guo’s version reads *gǔ yòu* reflex. Li’s version reads *jū yào* reflex. Sima states: Like a cry. *Háo zhě* (号者): *háo* reflex. Guo’s version also reads *hù bào* reflex. Sima states: Like a wail. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The *zhě* was originally omitted; it has been added here to match the other entries. *Yǎo zhě* (宎者): Xu’s version reads *yú yáo* reflex, also *yǎo* reflex, also *yú diào* reflex. Sima states: The deep one, like something profoundly *yǎo*. *Yǎo zhě* (咬者): *yú jiāo* reflex, also *jiǎo* reflex. Sima states: A mournful, plaintive sound like *yǎo yǎo*. Also *xǔ bài* reflex.

(7) **Commentary:** Though the notes and tones of sound may transform in a thousand ways, in their harmonies and responses, whether great or small, none fail to match what they receive and each fits its allotted portion.
**Subcommentary:** *Líng* is a gentle wind. *Piāo* is a fierce wind. *Yú* and *yóng* are the sounds of trees swaying back and forth as the wind blows through them. Thus the *línglíng* clear breeze produces a soft harmony, while the violent *piāo* wind produces a loud harmony—each matches what it receives, with no superiority or inferiority, just as the myriad things receive their qi naturally.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Chàng yú* (唱于): Read as written. *Chàng yóng* (唱喁): *wǔ gōng* reflex. Xu’s version also reads *yú* reflex, also *wǔ dòu* reflex. Li states: *Yú yóng* is the sound of mutual harmony. *Líng fēng* (泠风): *líng* reflex. Li states: *Línglíng* is a gentle wind. *Xiǎo hè* (小和): *hú wò* reflex. The same applies below and in the commentary. *Piāo fēng* (飘风): *bí yáo* reflex, also *fú yáo* reflex. Li’s version reads *fū yáo* reflex. Sima states: A swift wind. The *Erya* states: A whirling wind is called *piāo*. *Bù chèn* (不称): *chǐ zhèng* reflex. *Qí fèn* (其分): *fú wèn* reflex. The same applies below where not specified.

(8) **Commentary:** *Jì* means to cease. When a fierce wind arises, the myriad apertures are full; when it ceases, the myriad apertures are empty.

Though emptiness and fullness differ, their attainment of their own nature is the same.

**Commentary:**
*Lì* means great or fierce. *Jì* means to cease. When a great wind ceases, the myriad apertures are empty; when it stirs, the myriad apertures are full. Though emptiness and fullness differ, each attains its own state—this is the same. How much more do the four seasons’ waxing and waning, the two forces’ generation and destruction, proceed without intent to nurture or harm, and without design to bless or destroy!

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Lì fēng* (厉风): Sima states: a great wind. Xiang and Guo state: a fierce wind.
*Jì* (济): *zǐ xì* reflex. Xiang states: to cease.
◎ Qing Fan notes: *Lì fēng jì*—*jì* means to cease. The *Odes*’ *Yong Feng* reads *zài chí piān xuán jì*, and the Mao commentary states: *jì* means to cease. When the wind ceases, the ten thousand sounds fall silent, hence it is said the myriad apertures are empty.

(9)
**Commentary:**
*Tiáotiáo* (*diāodiāo* → *dāodāo*) is the appearance of movement and shaking. Though the sounds of things differ, and the movements of their forms likewise vary, their attainment of uniformity is the same. How could *tiáotiáo* alone be right and *dāodāo* alone be wrong?

**Commentary:**
*Ér* means "you." *Tiáotiáo* (*diāodiāo* → *dāodāo*) is the appearance of movement and shaking. Though the forms of things differ and their movements likewise vary, though there are distinctions between *tiáo* and *dāo*, ultimately there is no difference of right and wrong. How much more do fullness and emptiness, gathering and dispersal, life and death, success and failure follow the natural principle of things, inevitably so—how could there be right and wrong, approval or disapproval among them?

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Tiáotiáo* (调调): *tiáo* reflex.
*Dāodāo* (刀刀): Xu: *dū yáo* reflex. Xiang states: *tiáotiáo dāodāo* both describe the appearance of movement and shaking.
◎ Lu Wenchang states: The old text uniformly wrote *diāo*, a vulgar form; now corrected to the proper character.
*Dòngyáo* (动摇): Read as written, or *yáng zhào* reflex.
**Collation Notes:**
(1) *Quēwù* cites Li’s edition: *liù* written as *liù*, *lì jiù* reflex.
(2) The character *dāo* follows the Shide Tang edition and Lu’s collation; the commentary and sub-commentary below are likewise corrected.
(3) Below, two characters—*zuò yīn*—are suspected to be missing.
The *Zhi Bei You* chapter reads: "That which lives is *yīnyì* of things," and the pronunciation notes give *yīn* as *yīn* reflex, citing Li and Guo: *yīnyì* is the appearance of qi gathering. *Yīn* qi is also qi gathering.
(4) The character *xǔ* follows the original edition of the pronunciation notes.
(5) The Baojing Hall original block-print edition writes *wéi* as *shuí*, an error. This text originally wrote *wéi*, which is also incorrect. The character should be *suī*.
(6) *Yóu* and *yóu* were interchangeable in ancient times; henceforth, they are distinguished by meaning.
(7) The character *wū* follows the original edition of the pronunciation notes.
(8) The character *zhòng* follows the Shide Tang edition and the commentary above. The Zhao Jianyi edition also writes *yì*.
(9) The character *yě* is supplied following the sentence structure of the preceding and following text.

Ziyou said: "The earthly *lài* is simply the myriad apertures; the human *lài* is simply the bamboo flutes. May I ask about the heavenly *lài*?"

(1)
**Commentary:**
The earthly *lài* refers to apertures and cavities; the human *lài* refers to flutes and pipes—both are visible to the eye and thus knowable. Only the heavenly *lài* is profoundly mysterious and difficult to grasp at once. I humbly present my ignorance and ask to resolve my doubts.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Bǐ zhú* (比竹): *pí zhì* reflex, or *bì lǚ* reflex. Li: *fú bì* reflex. The commentary is the same.

Ziqi said: "Now, the blowing of the ten thousand [winds] differs, yet each is made to be itself. All attain their own nature—who is the one that rouses them?"

(1)
**Commentary:**
This is the heavenly *lài*.

The heavenly *lài*—how could there be yet another separate thing? It is simply the assemblage of the myriad apertures and bamboo flutes, joined with all living kinds, converging to form as one Heaven. The non-existent, being non-existent, cannot generate the existent; the existent, before it comes to be, cannot act as generator. Then who is it that engenders engendering? It is but the self-engendering of the clod-like. Self-engendering—it is not that I engender. Since I cannot engender things, and things cannot engender me, then I am self-so. Being self-so, it is called "Heaven-so." "Heaven-so"—it is not made, and thus is spoken of as Heaven. *(Speaking of it as Heaven)*—this is to clarify its self-so nature; how could it refer to the azure expanse? Yet some suppose that the heavenly *lài* compels things to follow its command. But if Heaven itself cannot possess itself, how could it possess things? Thus, "Heaven" is the collective name for the ten thousand things; none is singled out as Heaven—who then would command things? Therefore, things each self-engender without any source—this is the Dao of Heaven.

**Commentary:**
Now, "Heaven" is the collective name for the ten thousand things, an alternate designation for the self-so—how could it refer to the azure expanse? Thus, the heavenly *lài*—how could there be another separate thing? It is simply the bamboo flutes and myriad apertures joined with all living kinds. Tracing who it is that engenders engendering, it is no-thing. Thus, externally it does not depend on things, internally it does not rely on the self; it engenders clod-like, as solitary transformation. Hence Guo’s commentary states: "Being self-so, it is called 'Heaven-so.'" Speaking of it as "Heaven-so" clarifies its self-so nature. And yet it says, "the blowing of the ten thousand [winds] differs." Now, wind is but one body, while apertures are myriad and distinct; though their sizes differ, each accords with what it receives, all following their own knowing—how could they rely on another? This is the heavenly *lài*. Thus we know that spring’s birth and summer’s growth, the eye’s seeing and the ear’s hearing, whether taking from the near body or entrusting to distant things, all are without knowledge of their *how*, utterly unable to discern their *why*. Each is made to be itself, each portion sufficient in its lot, moving in accord with its nature, not by mind or wit—this is what is meant by "nurturing them, poisoning them." Such is the great meaning of the heavenly *lài*.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Qǐ fù*: *fú yòu* reflex.
*Mò dí*: *dīng lì* reflex.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Wen Xuan* (Selections of Refined Literature), in the commentary to Xie Lingyun’s poem "On the Ninth Day, Following Duke Song at the Xima Terrace Assembly to Send Off Magistrate Kong," cites Sima [Biao] as saying: "Blowing the ten thousand" refers to the heavenly *qi* blowing and warming, giving life to the ten thousand things, each with its distinct form and *qi*. *Yǐ* 已 means "to stop," allowing each to attain its nature and come to rest. The same citation appears in the commentary to Xie Lingyun’s poem "On the Road, Recalling the Mountains" and Jiang Yan’s poem "Miscellaneous Styles." The *Shiwen* is missing.

【Another note】All things attain this of themselves—who is the master that enrages them into being thus? This further clarifies the heavenly *lài*.

【Exegesis】"Self-taking" is like "self-attaining." The winds and apertures differ, so their forms and sounds vary; yet in each taking its own sufficiency, they are never unequal. But when they rage and stir into sound, who makes them thus? This is to show that the myriad living things, tangled and diverse, each taking from its allotted portion, are never insufficient. Whether flying or walking, who makes them thus? Thus we know that in their drumming and rousing, none knows its master. This is to further clarify the meaning of the heavenly *lài*.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Cǐ zhòng*: *zhí yòng* reflex.

【Collation Notes】
(1) Four characters added following the Shide Tang edition.
(2) The characters "Lingyun" amended following the original *Wen Xuan* text.

The great knowledge is at ease, the small knowledge is at odds;
The great words blaze, the small words chatter.
In sleep, their spirits intertwine; in waking, their forms open,
Engaging with others in construction, daily battling with the heart.
Some are slack, some deep, some dense.
Small fears make one tremble; great fears leave one dispirited.
Their release is like the trigger of a crossbow—this is what is meant by "overseeing right and wrong";
Their retention is like a sworn oath—this is what is meant by "guarding victory."
Their decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily consumption;
What they drown in, what they do, cannot be restored.
Their satiation is like a sealed letter, speaking of their aging and decay;
The heart near death cannot be made to revive.
Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, thought and sighing, change and dread, coquetry and ease, opening and posturing—
Music emerges from emptiness, steam gives rise to mushrooms.
Day and night succeed one another before us, yet none knows where they sprout.
Ah, ah! Morning and evening attain this—this is how they come to be!

【Note to first line】This likely refers to differences in knowledge.
【Exegesis】*Xiánxián* 闲闲 means "at ease." *Jiànjiàn* 闲闲 means "discerning." Those of great wisdom and broad capacity follow their nature in emptiness and indifference, without right or wrong; those of small knowledge and narrow ability are constrained in spirit, taking and rejecting. Taking and rejecting lead to separation and discernment; without right or wrong, one is at ease and expansive.
【Pronunciation Notes】
*Dà zhī*: read as *zhì*. The same applies below and in the notes.
*Xiánxián*: Li [Yi] says: "without bearing." Jianwen says: "the appearance of vastness."
*Jiànjiàn*: *gǔ xián* reflex, having something to separate.
◎ Yu Yue says: *Guangya* *Shigu* defines *xián* as "to observe." *Xiǎo zhī jiànjiàn* should follow this meaning, referring to those who like to observe others. The *Shiwen*’s "having something to separate" is incorrect.

【Note to second line】This likely refers to differences in speech.
【Exegesis】*Yányán* 炎炎 means "fierce." *Zhānzhān* 詹詹 means "verbose." Great words expounding principle are like a raging fire burning across the plain, sweeping clean without residue. The petty words of the Confucians and Mohists are mired in contention, merely verbose without benefiting the teaching.
【Pronunciation Notes】
*Yányán*: *yú lián*, *yú fán* two reflexes, also read as *tán*. Li [Yi] writes *dàn*, *tú làn* reflex. Li Yi says: "the same as *shìfēi* 是非 (right and wrong)." Jianwen says: "the appearance of flourishing."
*Zhānzhān*: read as *zhān*. Li Yi says: "the appearance of petty disputation." Cui [Zhuo] writes *yán* 阎.

【Note to third line】This likely refers to differences in waking and sleeping.
【Exegesis】The common and vulgar, their spirits restless and agitated, cling to external circumstances without pause. Thus in their dreaming, their spirits wander and intertwine; in their waking, their forms open to take in the world.
【Pronunciation Notes】
*Hún jiāo*: Sima [Biao] says: "spirits intertwining."
*Qí jué*: *gǔ xiào* reflex.
*Xíng kāi*: Sima [Biao] says: "eyes open, mind awakened."

【Note to fourth line】This likely refers to differences in interaction.
【Exegesis】*Gòu* 构 means "to join." *Jiào* 窖 means "deep," as in digging a pit to store grain. *Mì* 密 means "hidden." In engaging with worldly affairs, joining root and dust, the deluded mind grows heavy, insatiable in its thirst for days. Thus they cherish every moment, their hearts battling with the sun. As their minds chase after circumstances, their natures vary endlessly—roughly speaking, there are these three distinctions.
【Pronunciation Notes】
*Yǔ jiē wéi gòu*: Sima [Biao] says: "human interactions, constructing bonds of affection."
*Màn zhě*: *mò dàn* reflex. Jianwen says: "relaxed in mind."
*Jiào zhě*: *gǔ xiào* reflex. Sima [Biao] says: "deep." Li [Yi] says: "a pit." Note: a pit dug to store grain is called *jiào*. Jianwen says: "deep in mind."

【Note to fifth line】This likely refers to differences in fear and trembling.
【Exegesis】*Zhuìzhuì* 惴惴 means "apprehensive." *Mànmàn* 缦缦 means "dispirited." Circumstances may comply or resist, but the heart is ever anxious, fearing they will not come to pass, filled with dread. Thus small fears make one tremble in apprehension, while great fears leave one dispirited and dejected.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Xiǎo kǒng*: *qū yǒng* reflex. Same below and in the commentary.
*Zhuìzhuì*: *zhī ruì* reflex. Li [Yi] says: "appearance of caution."
*Ěryǎ* says: "fear."
*Mànmàn*: Li [Yi] says: "appearance of equanimity toward life and death."
*Jì*: *qí jì* reflex.

【Six】
【Exegesis】*Jī* is the trigger of a crossbow. *Guā* is the nock of an arrow. *Sī* means "to govern." The heart, when set upon pursuing an object, is as swift as an arrow’s nock; when moved to resist harm, it is as fierce as a crossbow’s trigger. It is governed solely by the judgment of right and wrong, with no other consideration.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Jī guā*: *gǔ huó* reflex. *Jī* is the crossbow’s trigger. *Guā* is the arrow’s nock.
◎Qing Fan’s note: *Wenxuan*’s commentary on Bao Mingyuan’s *Ku Re Xing* cites Sima [Biao] as saying: "When right and wrong, good and ill contend and collide, calamity and ruin arrive as swiftly as the release of a crossbow’s trigger."
The *Pronunciation Notes* omit this.
◎Further note: *Jī* refers to the crossbow’s trigger. (See Zheng’s commentary on the *Book of Changes*’ *Appended Judgments*.) *Shiming* says: "A crossbow (*nǔ*) is so called because it is *wrathful* (*nù*). The part that hooks the string is called the *tooth* (*yá*); outside the tooth is the *frame* (*guō*); below the frame is the *hanging blade* (*xiàn dāo*). Together, they are called the *trigger* (*jī guā*), for they are as ingenious as a machine."

【Seven】
【Note】This likely refers to differences in movement and stillness.
【Exegesis】*Zǔ* means "to invoke." *Méng* means "to swear." The mind, when engaged in judging right and wrong, is like one invoking a curse or swearing an oath. When the heart seizes upon an object, it is no different from pledging an alliance. Firm and unyielding, its resolve lies in overcoming things.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Zǔ*: *cè jù* reflex.
*Méng*: *míng* sound; Xu [Shen] reads *wǔ gēng* reflex; Guo [Pu] reads *wǔ bìng* reflex.

【Eight】
【Note】Such is the daily decline and decay.
【Exegesis】In autumn’s withering and winter’s desolation, the scenes of things shift as swiftly as the crossing of arms. How could the deluded ever awaken? Yet they contend over vain right and wrong, never realizing that each day brings new decay. Human aging follows the same pattern.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Qí shā*: *sè jiè* reflex; Xu [Shen] reads *sè lì* reflex. Same in the note.

【Nine】
【Note】Such is the drowning that carries one away.
【Exegesis】Long mired in the realm of objects, one’s deeds have long strayed from the Dao and departed from truth. To seek a return to life’s source is now impossible.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Nì*: *nú dí* reflex; Guo *nú jiǎo* reflex.

【Ten】
【Note】Such is the drowning in desire that deepens with age.
【Exegesis】Drowning—submerged and lost. The deluded, sunk in desire, cling to their delusions as if bound by cords. Not only in youth do they indulge, but even in old age their drowning grows deeper.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Yàn*: *yú yè* reflex; Xu *yú rǎn* reflex, also *yú gǎn* reflex.
*Jiān*: Xu *gǔ xián* reflex.
*Xù*: Also written *yì*; *yì* sound; Guo *xǔ jué* reflex, also *yǐ zhì* reflex.

【Eleven】
【Note】Such is the pursuit of gain and disregard for calamity, where hidden schemes achieve their ends.
【Exegesis】*Mò* means “none”; *yáng* means “life.” The heart, mired in stagnation, nears the realm of death. To seek a return to the Way of life is impossible.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Jìn sǐ*: *jìn* as in “near.”
*Fù yáng*: *yáng* refers to life.

◎ Jia Shifu says: Daily the heart contends, its changes endless. The arbiter of right and wrong possesses a mechanism of ten thousand responses; the one who clings to victory holds a single fixed view. Some grow weary and seek to return, yet their killing is as autumn’s decree; some remain sunk in delusion, drowning in their deeds. There are those who seal their mechanism so tightly that no breath of living humanity remains. The conflicts of human hearts each reflect the mechanism they harbor—probe and grasp it.

【Twelve】
【Note】These are but differences of nature and disposition.
【Exegesis】The common and deluded, clinging to what opposes or accords with them, rejoice in accord and grieve in opposition. Yet grief and joy weigh heavier, while delight and anger are lighter. Delight brings gladness to the heart; joy moves the body to dance. Anger stirs immediate resentment; grief wracks the whole frame with wailing. Anxiety weighs future possibilities; sighing laments what has passed. Change alters what was; submission bends without resistance. Frivolity is light and restless; excess is lavish and unrestrained. Unleashing opens the floodgates of desire; affectation is seductive and alluring. The minds of beings shift endlessly—here, in brief, are twelve transformations. Examine them closely, and the dispositions of things become clear.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Āi lè*: *luò* sound.
*Zhé*: *zhī shè* reflex; Sima: “motionless appearance.”
*Yáo*: Guo *yáo* sound; Xu and Li *chì diào* reflex.
*Yì*: *yì* sound.
*Tài*: *chì dài* reflex; Li also *nú zài* reflex.

【Thirteen】
【Note】These are but differences of circumstance and change. From here above, a rough sketch of the boundless spontaneity of Heaven’s piping; from here below, the elucidation of boundless naturalness. Things each arise naturally, not knowing why they are so yet being so—thus, though forms differ endlessly, their *thusness* is ever the same.
【Exegesis】The flute’s hollow allows the birth of refined music; the steam of damp heat gives rise to morning mushrooms. So too the ten thousand things of the Two Modes: empty, insubstantial, untrue, arising from nothing—like mushrooms and music. If all is fleeting illusion, where is there room for delight or anger?

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Zhēng*: *zhī yīng* reflex.
*Chéng jùn*: *qí yǔn* reflex; Xiang: “to congeal.”
*Yǐ shàng*: *shí zhǎng* reflex.

【Fourteen】
【Note】Day and night alternate, the old giving way to the new. The ten thousand things of heaven and earth transform and renew daily, advancing with time—what thing initiates this? It is simply so of itself.
【Exegesis】Day and night turn in endless cycles, succeeding one another, each becoming the other’s predecessor. Trace their roots, and their form remains unknown.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Méng*: *wǔ gēng* reflex.

【Fifteen】
【Note】Speaking of their self-arising.
【Exegesis】*Yǐ* means “to cease.” Tracing day and night, their before and after are unknowable; to speculate is futile—better to cease. Yet if we further trace dawn and dusk, re-examining dusk and dawn, their origin remains unfathomable, their beginning and end unknown. To clarify the ten thousand phenomena of the world as empty and untrue, to trace life and death, is to find their essence utterly still. Thus the *Laozi* says: “Pursue it, and its head is not seen; follow it, and its tail is not seen.” The principle is just so.

【Pronunciation Notes】
*Dàn mù*: Also written *mò*; same sound.

【Collation Notes】
(1) *Quē wù* cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript: *xù* written as *yì*.
(2) Supplemented following the example of the line below.
(3) *Nù* also: following *Shì míng*, emended; the three characters *guō zé kuò* below also deleted following *Shì míng*.

Not the absence of another, not the absence of self—nothing to grasp. This is near enough, yet one knows not what compels it. As if a true master existed, yet no trace is found. It may act and be trusted, yet its form is unseen—it has sentience but no form. The hundred bones, nine orifices, six viscera—all are complete within me. With whom should I feel kinship? Do you delight in them all? Or is there a private preference? Are they all servants and maids? Are servants and maids insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns as lord and subject? Or is there a true lord present? Whether one seeks and finds its truth or not, it neither adds to nor diminishes its reality.

Having once received this completed form, one does not forget it until its end. Buffeted and worn by things, one’s course runs on like a galloping steed—none can halt it. Is this not sorrowful? A lifetime spent in toil, yet no success is seen; wearily exhausted, one knows not where to return. Is this not lamentable? Men call it "not dying"—what benefit is there? The form dissolves, the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow?

Is man’s life inherently so deluded? Am I alone deluded, while others remain undeluded? If one follows the heart’s settled inclinations and takes them as teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must there be those who know the succession of minds and yet still choose their own? Even fools share in this.

To possess right and wrong before the heart is fully formed—this is like arriving in Yue today yet having set out yesterday. Thus, to take non-being as being: even if the divine Yu were here, he could not comprehend it—how much less can I?

The myriad things and myriad sentiments each pursue or abandon differently—it is as though some true master were causing them to be so. Yet when one arises to seek traces of this true master, one ultimately finds nothing. Thus it is clear that all things are self-so, with no agent making them so.

The limbs differ in form, their functions distinct, as if governed by a true nature—yet in the end, no master is found. From whence do these first signs arise?

---

Now, the traveler trusts in himself and thus can proceed. Trusting in oneself and acting, moving as one’s will desires, the heavenly mechanism unfurls of itself, and one moves in accord with one’s nature—self-sufficient, self-reliant, what need is there for external aid?

---

One does not see the form by which such proceeding is attained.

All things trust in themselves to proceed, yet the appearance of such trust is not seen.

---

The sentiment accords with the thing, and thus the form is not separately perceived.

There is the wisdom of what can be done, yet no tangible form of self-trust.

---

Entrusting all to the natural, nothing fails to endure. The hundred bones, the nine orifices—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mouth, and the two lower passages—the six viscera—large intestine, small intestine, bladder, and the triple burner—and the five organs—liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—are all complete. The bones form the outer structure, the organs and viscera lie within, and the orifices connect inner and outer. These three aspects together constitute the body, and thus it is said that all endure.

The *Xiao Erya* aligns with Emperor Jianwen’s annotation: "to encompass."

---

**Note 8:** It simply exists of itself.

**Note 9:** If one explains everything, it implies partiality. With partiality, one cannot encompass and preserve all; thus, things exist without explanation and arise without action.

**Commentary:** The six senses and nine orifices all belong to one body—how could there be favoritism or private attachment? If one harbors affection, it is already partiality. To claim the body as private is unreasonable. All things are entrusted to their natural place, governed by their inherent function. This holds true for the body and for all things alike.

**Exegetical Note:** *"All explain"* is pronounced *yuè*, as in the annotation. Most modern editions use the character for "joy" (*yuè*). The same applies hereafter.

---

**Note 10:** If all things were private, ambition would exceed proper bounds, superiors and inferiors would encroach upon one another, and none would fulfill the roles of minister or servant. Those with the capacity of ministers and servants who do not accept their appointed tasks have lost their way. Thus, the relationship between ruler and minister, superior and inferior, inner and outer, hands and feet, is the natural principle of Heaven—how could it be the doing of the True Person?

**Commentary:** Ministers and servants are the lowly roles of men and women. Even within a single body, there is a distinction between ruler and minister: when seeing color, the eyes act as ruler while the ears serve as ministers; when walking, the feet act as ruler while the hands serve as ministers. This arises from Heaven’s principle—how could it be a human contrivance? It is not a matter of intentional favoritism but of natural hierarchy. Guo’s annotation states: "Those esteemed by the times become rulers; those whose talents do not match the age become ministers." Governing the state and governing the body differ not in principle.

---

**Note 11:** Ministers and servants merely fulfill their proper roles; this is not insufficient for mutual governance. Mutual governance resembles the hands, feet, ears, and eyes—each limb and part has its function and serves one another in turn.

**Commentary:** Ministers and servants perform their duties, each with its proper role. Just as the hands grasp and the feet walk, their functions are naturally sufficient—why would the feet walk because the hands are insufficient? The mechanism of Heaven unfolds spontaneously, without deliberate intent, yet all is governed. This example of hands and feet clarifies all other matters.

**Exegetical Note:** *"And in turn"* is pronounced *gēng*.

---

**Note 12:** Those esteemed by the times become rulers; those whose talents do not match the age become ministers. Like Heaven’s natural height and Earth’s natural lowness, the head resides above and the feet below—how could they alternate? Though there is no misplacement in their proper roles, they are inherently correct.

**Commentary:** The head naturally resides above, the feet naturally below; the eyes can see color, the ears can hear sound. Their use or disuse depends on the time, hence the distinction between noble and base. How could one impose preferences on high and low, alternating roles as ruler and minister? Simply entrusting all to their natural place ensures inherent correctness.

**Exegetical Note:** *"To alternate"* is pronounced *dì*; Xu also pronounces it *dì*. *"Does not match"* refers to response. *"No misplacement"* is pronounced *cuò*, as in "to interweave." The same applies below.

---

**Note 13:** Entrusting all to their nature ensures spontaneity, not artifice.

**Commentary:** Simply letting go without deliberate intent—this is the wondrous Dao of the True Ruler, dwelling within. Alternate interpretation: The True Ruler refers to the True Master mentioned earlier. The mind’s preferences—colors like blue and yellow—have no inherent nature; they arise from conditions, neither self nor other, neither non-existent nor existent. Thus, the text poses a hypothetical question to clarify that no True Ruler exists.

---

**Note 14:** Those who attain their true nature and employ their inherent capacities, even if they are menial servants, remain unmoved by praise or blame, content in their work. Thus, whether known or unknown, all remain naturally at ease. But if one opens the path of opportunism, inferiors encroach upon superiors, things lose their authenticity, and people forget their roots—then praise and blame cause one to lose composure.

**Commentary:** When mind and circumstances interact, desire and attachment arise. Thus, when one obtains what one seeks, it is deemed beneficial; when one does not, it is deemed harmful. This describes how the deluded mind clings to gain and loss, disturbing the heart. From the perspective of the Dao’s wisdom, nothing harms or benefits one’s true nature.

**Jiā Shìfù states:** "Self and other take shape and give rise to right and wrong. The right and wrong formed in the mind become its master through prior influence. Affirming this and negating that, one is enslaved by others—yet the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all subsumed and follow. If this subsumption and following serve another’s will, is there truly a distinction between the mind’s mastery and its enslavement? The mind’s mastery, with its right and wrong, what does it have to do with others? Seeking to align with others’ sentiments by affirming or negating brings no benefit; failing to do so brings no harm. Yet once the form of right and wrong is constructed, the mind is enslaved to follow it, guarding it unchangingly for a lifetime—this is what is called a *fixed mind*. The *fixed mind* is what ministers and servants serve."

**Exegetical Note:** *"Even if"* is pronounced *fúyòu*. The same applies below.

"《毁誉》" is pronounced *yú*. "《物丧》" is pronounced *xīlàng*.

**[15]**
**Commentary:** Each nature has its own allotment, thus the wise preserve their wisdom to the end, while the foolish cling to their folly until death—how could there be one who alters their nature midway?

**Explication:** The endowment of form and nature has its own limits; one cannot transform folly into wisdom, nor can one exchange ugliness for beauty. Thus, once form and nature are complete, they do not perish midway. One can only guard what lies within their allotment and await the exhaustion of their Heaven-appointed years.

**[16]**
**Commentary:** The myriad beings, each with their own tendencies, clash in opposition and accord. Each trusts their own partial view and indulges their conduct, yet none can turn back. These—compared to what the multitude deems lamentable—are indeed lamentable. Yet the multitude has never taken this as lamentable, for such is their nature. Each being’s nature is thus; what among them is worthy of lament?

**Explication:** *Rèn* means opposition; *mǐ* means accord. The myriad beings, each with their keen passions, pursue objects. Since objects may oppose or accord, the mind clings to right or wrong. Their conduct spans years, swift as galloping steeds; they know only to covet objects, never ceasing. Measuring the principles of things, this is deeply lamentable.

**[17]**
**Commentary:** The passions of beings are boundless, and those who know contentment are few. Thus, having gained this, they do not stop but pursue that. All exhaust themselves in lifelong servitude, never sating their aspirations, ceasing only in death. Therefore, their success is never seen to arrive.

**Explication:** In the floating competition of beings, those who know contentment are rare. Thus, having gained this, they do not rest but pursue that. They spend their lives in exhaustion, their lives consumed by greed, chasing shadows and grasping at wind—when will their achievements ever be complete?

**Pronunciation Note:** *"Those who know contentment are few"* is pronounced *zhě xiǎn*.

**[18]**
**Commentary:** All beings employ their forms and bones in service of what they love, becoming wearied and enfeebled. Yet they do not know the ultimate aim of this love!

**Explication:** *Niérán* describes the appearance of exhaustion. Their love is fervent, their minds and spirits labored, their forms and souls worn out, enfeebled and distressed. Yet they simply trust their hearts, loving this and coveting that, demanding meaning from their intentions—yet they know not where it leads. Such extreme foolishness is deeply pitiable.

**[Pronunciation Note:]**
*"Niérán"* is pronounced *nǎi jié* in the Lu Deming reading, while Xu Shen and Li Si read it as *nǎi xié*. Cui [Shu] glosses it as "the appearance of forgetfulness." Emperor Jianwen of Liang says: "the state of fatigue and illness." ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: In modern annotated editions, *niè* is often written as *ěr* (薾). The *Shuowen* cites the *Book of Songs*: *"Bǐ ěr wéi hé"*—its pronunciation and meaning differ from this. ◎ Qingfan observes: In Sima [Biao]’s text, *niè* is written as *ěr*. The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Xie Lingyun’s *"Passing by the Beginning Peace Villa"* quotes Sima: *"Ěr* means 'extreme.'" The *Pronunciation Note* omits this. *"Suǒ hào"* is pronounced *hū bào*; the same applies below.

**[19]**
**Commentary:** In truth, this is no different from death.
**Explication:** *Xī* means "what." So mired in obsession, exhausted yet unceasing—this harms one’s conduct and offers no benefit to spirit or *qi*. It may be called "though living in days, one’s years are as dead."

**[20]**
**Commentary:** Their hearts and forms race together, worn out yet never returning. Compared to what ordinary people pity, this is true great sorrow. Yet ordinary people never regard this as sorrow—thus what they *do* pity is not worth pitying.
**Explication:** *Rán* means "thus." Thoughts shift moment by moment, the new ceaselessly flowing away. As they transform into old age, the mind’s awareness grows dim, form and spirit both altered—this is what is meant by "thus." No worldly sorrow surpasses this.

**[21]**
**Commentary:** All the above matters arise without knowing *why* they arise—hence they are called *máng*. Now, those who do not know do not know *how* they know yet know nonetheless; the living do not know *how* they live yet live nonetheless. Though the myriad things differ, in that life does not arise from knowledge, none are different—thus the world is without exception *máng*.
**Explication:** *Máng* means "dark and deluded." Ordinary people in life are so benighted—everyone in the world is confused; is there even one who is not deluded? Yet Master Zhuang, a true person embodying the Dao, wields wisdom with clarity. He humbly aligns with the dust of the world, hence the phrase *"yet I alone am máng."* Guo’s commentary slightly diverges; I do not follow it here.

**[Pronunciation Note:]**
*"Máng hū"* is pronounced *mò gāng*, or alternatively *máng*. *Máng* means "dark and deluded." Emperor Jianwen of Liang says: *Máng* means "the same."

**[22]**
**Commentary:** That by which the heart governs the body’s functions is called the *established heart*. If one takes one’s own established heart as a teacher, then each person has their own teacher. Since each has their own teacher, entrusting them to it is fitting.
**Explication:** *Chéng xīn* refers to rigid attachment to partial views, clinging to one school’s biases. Following such a fixed and obstinate heart as one’s standard—this is how the world is, so who is without a teacher?

**[23]**
**Commentary:** To replace the unformed with the formed is not knowledge—it is merely the heart’s self-satisfaction. Thus the foolish also take their established hearts as teachers, unwilling to use what they deem "short" and abandon what they deem "long."
**Explication:** The deluded and confused stubbornly cling to right and wrong. Why must they know others’ strengths to replace their own weaknesses? They only seek to dismiss others as "short" and claim their own as "long." Such people are everywhere; the foolish are always among them.

**[Pronunciation Note:]**
*"Yǔ yǒu"* is pronounced *yù*. ◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Shuowen* defines *dài* as "to replace." Today one deems something right, tomorrow wrong—yet it is already fixed in the heart. Right and wrong emerge endlessly, hence *"knowledge replaces."* The heart deems something right, then takes what it calls "right" as right; it deems something wrong, then takes what it calls "wrong" as wrong—hence *"the heart takes for itself."* *"Ér shě"* is pronounced *shě*; the character is also written as 舍, with the same pronunciation below.

**[24]**
**Commentary:** If one sets out for Yue today, how could one have arrived yesterday? Without the heart’s formation, how could right and wrong arise? That right and wrong exist is something no group can avoid—thus the perfected person accords with both.
**Explication:** The road to Wu and Yue is long; one must travel for days to arrive. If one sets out this morning, how could one have arrived yesterday? This illustrates that right and wrong, self and other, arise from deluded hearts. If the heart has not yet arisen, from where could right and wrong come? Thus, one first distinguishes and then right and wrong arise; one first sets out on the road and then reaches Yue.

**[Pronunciation Note:]**
*"Xī zhì"*—Cui [Shu] says: *Xī* means "evening." Xiang [Xiu] says: *Xī* means "yesterday." ◎ Jia Shifu says: Right and wrong arise from interaction between self and other. Yet the heart must first have a standard of right and wrong, then deem something right and affirm it, or deem something wrong and reject it. The heart responds endlessly to the myriad things, so right and wrong also become endless. Right and wrong arise from the human heart—this is why public opinion is never uniform.

**[25]**
**Commentary:** In principle, there is no right or wrong, yet the deluded take it as existing—this is taking what is not as if it were. Once the deluded heart is formed, even a sage cannot dispel it; thus one entrusts it to its natural state without forcing knowledge.
**Explication:** Yu the Great, styled Wenming, was Gun’s son and Qi’s father. The *Laws of Posthumous Titles* state: "Flowing like a spring is called *Yǔ*"; another says: "Succeeding through abdication and achieving merit is called *Yǔ*." In principle, there is no right or wrong, yet the deluded take it as existing—this is taking what is not as if it were. Once delusion has taken root, the deluded heart is formed; even a divine person like Yu the Great cannot make them awaken. Master Zhuang, deeply compassionate in his salvation, could only lament—thus he entrusted it to its natural state without forcing knowledge.

**[Pronunciation Note:]**
*"Bù qiǎng"* is pronounced *qí zhàng*. **[Textual Note:]**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition has 有若 (*yǒu ruò*) where others have 若有 (*ruò yǒu*).

(2) The Zhao edition originally composed its own chapter titles. (3–4) The character *bǐ* and this character follow the Song edition and the Shidetang edition. (5) The Shidetang edition writes *ěr*. (6) The character *jiē* is supplied following the Daozang edition of Jiao Hong.

Now, speech is not like the blowing of wind. Those who speak have their say, yet what they speak of remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Does it differ from the chirping of fledglings—does it possess distinction, or does it lack distinction?

Where does the Dao conceal itself to produce truth and falsity? Where does speech conceal itself to produce right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it does not abide? Where does speech abide that it cannot be trusted?

The Dao is obscured by minor accomplishments; speech is obscured by florid embellishment. Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other negates and negating what the other affirms. If one wishes to affirm what the other negates and negate what the other affirms, then nothing surpasses illumination.

**[Annotation 1]**
Each has what they expound, hence it differs from the blowing of wind.

**[Explication]**
Both names and speech, like the blowing of wind, are forms of sound, yet those who speak must possess explanation and distinction—thus it is said they "have speech."

**[Pronunciation Note]**
*Chuī yě*: read as written, or *chì ruì* as in Cui’s note. Cui says: "Blowing, like the sound of pipes."

**[Annotation 2]**
What I deem right, others deem wrong; what others deem right, I deem wrong—thus it remains unsettled. This unsettledness arises from the partiality of self and other.

**[Explication]**
Though there is this speech, distinct from the blowing of wind, all say "I am right" and "they are wrong." Since self and other are partial, it remains uniquely unsettled.

**[Annotation 3]**
Does one take it as speech? Yet it is insufficient to settle anything.

**[Annotation 4]**
Does one take it as no speech? Yet each has already spoken from their own position.

**[Explication]**
*Guǒ* means "determined." This deems it right, that deems it wrong; this deems it wrong, that deems it right. Since right and wrong are unsettled, what does speech truly expound? Thus it is insufficient to claim there is definite speech. Yet with partial views on both sides, each clings to right and wrong, and from their own position, it cannot be said there is no speech.

**[Annotation 5]**
Speech and the chirping of fledglings share the same end—whether they possess distinction or lack distinction cannot truly be settled. The sentiments of the world need not be the same, yet what is spoken cannot differ, hence right and wrong arise in profusion, with no way to settle them.

**[Explication]**
*Biàn* means "distinction." When a birdling seeks to emerge from its egg and chirps, this is called the sound of a fledgling; speech that is still encased is also called a fledgling. With partial clinging on both sides and right and wrong unsettled, how does it differ from the sound of fledglings—possessing sound but no distinction? Thus, to claim that speech differs from the sound of fledglings may not suffice to establish distinction.

**[Pronunciation Note]**
*Kòu*: *kǔ dòu* as a fanqie, or Li reads it as *gòu*. Sima says: "A birdling about to emerge."

**[Explication 6]**
*Wū hū* means "in what" or "where." The Dao, empty and all-pervading, is neither true nor false—where could it conceal itself to give rise to truth and falsity?

**[Pronunciation Note]**
*Wū hū*: pronounced *wū*; the same below. *Zhēn wěi*: one edition writes *zhēn guǐ*; Cui’s edition writes *zhēn rán*.

**[Annotation 7]**
The Dao is nowhere absent! Where does speech conceal itself to produce truth and falsity, giving rise to the profusion of names for right and wrong?

**[Explication]**
The ultimate teaching and ultimate speech are neither right nor wrong—where do they conceal themselves to produce right and wrong?

**[Pronunciation Note]**
*Dào yān*: *yú qián* as a fanqie.

**[Annotation 8]**
It abides everywhere.

**[Explication]**
*Cún* means "to be present." The Dao, which shapes and nurtures living beings, pervades all without ceasing—where is it not present? Thus it is present in falsity and truth, yet neither true nor false.

**[Annotation 9]**
It is all permissible.

**[Explication]**
The mysterious Dao and true speech give life and take it away according to things—where is it not permissible? Thus it affirms what can be affirmed and negates what can be negated, yet neither negates what is not nor affirms what is not.

**[Explication 10]**
"Minor accomplishments" refers to benevolence, righteousness, and the Five Virtues—small paths that achieve some attainment, hence called minor accomplishments. In an age of shallow customs and frivolous times, only benevolence and righteousness are practiced, and the great Dao cannot be enacted. Thus it is said the Dao is obscured by minor accomplishments, yet the Dao cannot truly be obscured. Hence Laozi says: "When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness."

**[Annotation 11]**
Minor accomplishments and florid embellishment conceal themselves within the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be concealed. Thus truth and falsity, right and wrong, operate within florid embellishment and halt at what is truly fitting; they appear in minor accomplishments and vanish in great wholeness.

**[Explication]**
"Florid embellishment" refers to ornate, disputatious words and flowery speech. Precisely because it clings to florid disputation, it obscures the ultimate speech. Thus Laozi’s scripture says: "Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy."

**[Pronunciation Note]**
*Shí dàng*: *dīng làng* as a fanqie. The rest can be inferred and will not be repeatedly noted. *Jiàn yú*: *xián biàn* as a fanqie.

**[Explication 12]**
Long ago, there was a man of Zheng named Huan who studied in the land of Qiu. After three years, his skills were perfected, and he transformed into a Confucian. Confucians trace their lineage to Yao and Shun, take the regulations of Wen and Wu as their model, practice the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, and distinguish the positions of high and low—hence they are called Confucians. Huan’s younger brother was named Di; Huan transformed his brother, and he became a Mohist. Mohists follow the Dao of Yu: they esteem worthiness, revere ritual, practice frugality and universal love, and wear themselves to the bone to save the common people—this is called Mohism.

Huan and Di, though kin as brothers, each adhered to a different teaching and ceaselessly disputed one another’s right and wrong. Huan resented his brother so deeply that he died of indignation. Yet the conflict between self and other, right and wrong, has endured since ancient times. The intensity of such contention arose with these two worthies, who are thus singled out as the ringleaders of factional strife. This shows that when the Dao is lost, words are obscured, and the scrutiny of right and wrong begins.

**[Explication 13]**
**Annotation:** As Confucians and Mohists disputed one another’s right and wrong, the world became divided between Confucians and Mohists. Thus, the Hundred Schools arose, each prizing its own views and never stepping beyond its own bounds.

**Explication:** The world takes itself as right and others as wrong; others likewise deem you wrong and themselves right. Thus, each uses its own right to affirm the other’s wrong, and its own wrong to negate the other’s right.

**[Fanqie]**
*Gēng xiāng*: *gēng* as a fanqie.

**[Explication 14]**
**Annotation:** Those who affirm right and wrong are what Confucians and Mohists affirm; those who negate right and wrong are what Confucians and Mohists negate. Now, to affirm what Confucians and Mohists negate and negate what Confucians and Mohists affirm is to seek to clarify the negation of right and wrong. To clarify the negation of right and wrong, nothing surpasses using Confucians and Mohists to mutually illuminate one another. When they mutually illuminate one another, what they affirm is not truly right, and what they negate is not truly wrong. If what is negated is not wrong, then there is no wrong; if what is affirmed is not right, then there is no right.

**Explication:** The world deems others wrong and itself right. To invert wrong into right and right into wrong, nothing surpasses using self and other to mutually illuminate one another. When they mutually illuminate one another, what is negated is not truly wrong—thus there is no wrong—and what is affirmed is not truly right—thus there is no right. With no right, there is no wrong, and one realizes that right and wrong are both illusory.

◎ **Jia Shifu’s note:** Guo Xiang says, “Those who affirm right and wrong are what Confucians and Mohists affirm; those who negate right and wrong are what Confucians and Mohists negate. Now, to affirm what Confucians and Mohists negate and negate what Confucians and Mohists affirm, nothing surpasses using Confucians and Mohists to mutually illuminate one another, so that what they affirm is not truly right and what they negate is not truly wrong.” Upon examining the books of Mozi and Mencius’s refutations of Yang and Mo, one sees Confucians and Mohists disputing one another’s right and wrong, each clinging to its own views to seek victory. Mohists affirm what Confucians negate, and Confucians negate what Mohists affirm. The formation of right and wrong, the division of self and other, arise from this. Self and other take opposing forms, and right and wrong stand in duality—thus, the right and wrong they uphold are not true right and wrong, for the distinction between self and other remains. Nothing surpasses using the clarity of one to mutually verify the other. Guo Xiang’s annotation is mistaken.

**Textual Notes:**
*[Fanfu]* reads *fāng fú* (芳服). The same below.
**Emendation:** (1) The character *qiú* follows the *Yufu* chapter.

Things are nothing that is not "that," things are nothing that is not "this." From the perspective of "that," one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: "That" emerges from "this," and "this" likewise depends on "that." This is the doctrine of "that" and "this" arising in mutual opposition. Yet even as they arise, they are already dying; even as they die, they are already arising. Even as "right" is affirmed, "wrong" is affirmed; even as "wrong" is affirmed, "right" is affirmed. Affirming "right" because of "wrong," affirming "wrong" because of "right."

Therefore, the sage does not proceed by this path but illuminates it by means of Heaven—this too is a matter of dependence. "This" is also "that," and "that" is also "this." "That" has its own right and wrong, and "this" has its own right and wrong. Is there truly a "that" and "this"? Or is there truly no "that" and "this"? Where "that" and "this" find no counterpart, this is called the *pivot of the Dao*. Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the ring, it responds to the infinite. "Right" is one infinity, and "wrong" is another infinity. Thus it is said: nothing surpasses using clarity.

To illustrate the non-"finger"-ness of a finger by means of a finger is not as good as illustrating the non-"finger"-ness of a finger by means of a non-finger. To illustrate the non-"horse"-ness of a horse by means of a horse is not as good as illustrating the non-"horse"-ness of a horse by means of a non-horse. Heaven and Earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.

**Annotations:**
1. **Commentary:** All things regard themselves as "right," hence nothing is not "right"; all things regard others as "that," hence nothing is not "that." If nothing is not "that," then there is no "right" in the world; if nothing is not "right," then there is no "that" in the world. Without "that" and without "right," this is the profound unity.
   **Exegesis:** As the commentary states: all things regard themselves as "right," hence nothing is not "right"; all things regard others as "that," hence nothing is not "that." If nothing is not "that," then there is no "right" in the world; if nothing is not "right," then there is no "that" in the world. Without "that" and without "right," this is the profound unity. This commentary exhausts the principle; no further explanation is needed.

2. **Exegesis:** When one is regarded as "that" by "that," one does not see oneself; when one knows oneself as "right," one then knows. The partiality of things is universally like this. If one could truly see the other’s perspective and one’s own, then there would be no "right" and no "wrong."

3. **Commentary:** The partiality of things means that none see what the other sees but only know what they themselves know. Knowing what they themselves know, they regard themselves as "right." Regarding themselves as "right," they regard the other as "wrong." Thus it is said: "That" emerges from "this," and "this" likewise depends on "that"—"that" and "this" arise in mutual dependence.
   **Exegesis:** Now, "that" opposes "this," and "right" depends on "wrong"—this is the general structure of discourse. The statement "that emerges from this" expresses a subtle principle, emphasizing the angle of "that." It aims to show that by illustrating "that," one clarifies "this," and by illustrating "right," one clarifies "wrong." Yet "that" and "this," "right" and "wrong," arise in mutual dependence. When one seeks to analyze them, their very essence is emptiness.

4. **Commentary:** The transformations of life and death are like the progression of the four seasons: spring, autumn, winter, summer. Thus, though the states of life and death differ, in each finding peace where they are, they are the same. Now, the living regard life as life, while the dead regard life as death—thus there is no life. The living regard death as death, while the dead regard death as life—thus there is no death. Without life and without death, without "right" and without "wrong," the debates of Confucians and Mohists are something with which I cannot agree. Yet when each obscures their own position, I cannot disagree either.
   **Exegesis:** *Fāng* means "just now." The mutual opposition of "that" and "this," "right" and "wrong," is no different from the doctrine of life and death. Life and death alternate like the succession of cold and heat. The living regard life as life, while the dead regard life as death. Likewise, those who affirm "right" regard "right" as "right," while those who negate it regard "right" as "wrong." Thus, one affirms "wrong" because of "right," and affirms "right" because of "wrong." Affirming "right" because of "wrong" means there is no "right"; affirming "wrong" because of "right" means there is no "wrong." Thus, without "right" and without "wrong," without life and without death, without "right" and without "wrong," what debate is there between "that" and "this"?

5. **Commentary:** The open-minded one relies on the world’s "right" and "wrong" to be without "right" and "wrong." Thus, not proceeding by the path of "right" and "wrong," and having no concern that "right" and "wrong" are not properly aligned, one simply illuminates their natural state without being swayed.
   **Exegesis:** *Tiān* means "nature." The sage, in profound understanding, does not proceed by affirming "right" or negating "wrong," but simply abides in emptiness and stillness, illuminating with the wisdom of nature. Only by means of this "right" and "wrong" does one attain non-"wrong" and non-"right," never abandoning existence to separately verify non-existence.

6. **Commentary:** I am also regarded as "that" by "that."

7. **Commentary:** "That" also regards itself as "right."
   **Exegesis:** I regard myself as "right," yet I am negated by "that"; I regard "that" as "wrong," yet "that" also regards itself as "right."

8. **Commentary:** "This" regards itself as "right" and negates "that"; "that" regards itself as "right" and negates "this." Thus, "this" and "that" each have their own "right" and "wrong" within their own framework.
   **Exegesis:** "This" regards itself as "right," and "that" regards itself as "right"; "this" negates "that," and "that" negates "this." Thus, each has its own "right" and its own "wrong."

9. **Commentary:** Now, if one wishes to regard "that" as "that," "that" regards itself as "right"; if one wishes to regard "right" as "right," "right" is regarded as "that" by "that." Thus, the existence or non-existence of "that" and "right" is not yet definitively settled.
   **Exegesis:** "That" and "this," "right" and "wrong," stand in mutual opposition. When one examines them in reverse, their entire substance is floating and insubstantial. Though one regards oneself as "right," this is not without basis.

To be negated by "that" is to lack "this." The existence or non-existence of "that" and "this" cannot yet be determined.

**Exegesis:** 《彼复》pronounced *fúyòu*, same below.

**10. Commentary:** "Occasional" means "opposition." "That" and "this" stand in opposition, yet the sage accords with both. Thus, the one without intent merges with things, never having any opposition in the world. (The *pivot* is the essential.) Abiding in this pivot and converging at the profound extremity, one responds to the boundless.

**Exegesis:** "Occasional" means "opposition." The *pivot* is the essential. To embody the emptiness of both "that" and "this," the illusoriness of both "right" and "wrong," and to perceive with concentrated spirit without opposition in the world—this is to converge at the profound extremity and grasp the pivot of the Dao. Earlier, a hypothetical question was posed about existence and non-existence, with affirmation and negation unsettled; here, "that" and "this" are further clarified as inherently empty. The former is shallow, the latter profound—hence their sequence.

**Exegesis:** 《道枢》pronounced *chǐzhū*. The *pivot* is the essential. 《以应》means "to respond." As in the previous note, subsequent instances may be inferred and will not be repeatedly annotated.

**11. Commentary:** Now, "right" and "wrong" reverse endlessly, pursuing one another without cease—hence they are called a *ring*. The center of the ring is empty. If one takes "right" and "wrong" as a ring and attains its center, one attains neither "right" nor "wrong." Having neither "right" nor "wrong," one can respond to "right" and "wrong." Since "right" and "wrong" are endless, so too is the response.

**Exegesis:** The absolute transformation beyond dependence is the origin of the Dao and the essential of learning—hence it is called the *pivot*. The *ring* is metaphorically two apertures; the *center* is the true emptiness of the one Dao. The center of the ring is empty, illustrating the absence of both "right" and "wrong." Since "right" and "wrong" are endless, so too is the response.

◎ Jia Shifu says: As "right" and "wrong" transform, the Dao abides therein—hence it is called the *pivot of the Dao*. Grasping the pivot of the Dao and roaming within the ring, the *center* is emptiness. "Right" and "wrong" reverse endlessly, pursuing one another like a ring. Roaming within emptiness, one is not enslaved by "right" and "wrong" and can thus respond without end.

◎ Qingfan notes: The Tang Buddhist Zhanran’s *Zhiguan Fuxing Chuan Hongjue* cites an ancient commentary on the *Zhuangzi*: "The interior of a circular ring is empty and boundless—hence it is called the *center of the ring*."

**12. Commentary:** In the world, none do not regard themselves as "right" and none do not negate others. Thus, one "right" and one "wrong" proceed endlessly. Only one who enters emptiness and attains the center remains unbound, riding it to roam.

**Exegesis:** There are none who do not regard themselves as "right"—hence "right" is endless. There are none who do not negate others—hence "wrong" is endless. Only one who forgets both self and other, relinquishes both "right" and "wrong," and attains the Dao within the ring can thus accord with all beings and ride it to roam.

**13. Exegesis:** "Finger" refers to a finger of the hand. "Horse" refers to a gaming piece. "Metaphor" means "comparison." People cling to "right" and "wrong," their sentiments differing between self and other. Thus, if one uses one’s own finger to compare with another’s finger, the other’s finger becomes a "non-finger." If one then uses the other’s finger to compare with your finger, your finger becomes a "non-finger" relative to the other’s. The same principle applies to fingers as to horses. Among all dharmas, the finger is uniquely venerated to illustrate that nothing is more immediate than the body or more essential than the finger, while nothing is more distant than external things or more decisive in victory and defeat than the horse. Thus, these two examples are used to illustrate "right" and "wrong."

**14. Commentary:** To regard oneself as "right" and negate others is the common sentiment of self and other. Thus, if one uses one’s own finger to illustrate another’s finger, the other’s finger becomes a "non-finger" relative to one’s own. This is using a finger to illustrate the "non-finger" nature of a finger. If one then uses the other’s finger to illustrate one’s own, one’s own finger becomes a "non-finger" relative to the other’s. This is using a "non-finger" to illustrate the "non-finger" nature of a finger. To clarify the absence of both "right" and "wrong," nothing is better than mutual illustration through reversal. Through mutual illustration, self and other are alike in regarding themselves as "right" and alike in negating one another. Being alike in negation, the world has no "right"; being alike in self-affirmation, the world has no "wrong." How can this be demonstrated? If "right" were truly "right," the world would have no one to negate it. If "wrong" were truly "wrong," the world would likewise have no one to affirm it. Now, with no fixed ground for "right" or "wrong," all is confusion and disorder—showing that these petty distinctions are merely each clinging to their own biases while converging in uniformity. Looking up and down, none are otherwise. Thus, the perfected person knows that heaven and earth are one finger, and the myriad things are one horse. Hence, they abide in vast tranquility, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things each attain their place, converging in self-contentment, without "right" or "wrong."

**Exegesis:** Though the world is vast, it can be encompassed by one finger. Though the myriad things are many, they can be governed by one horse. How is this known? Now, through mutual illustration by reversal of "right" and "wrong" between self and other, what is affirmed is not truly "right," and what is negated is not truly "wrong." Thus, the two poles and the myriad things are without "right" or "wrong."

**Exegesis:** 《天地一指也万物一马也》Cui says: "A finger is one part of the hundred limbs; a horse is one thing among the myriad things." 《浩然》pronounced *hùlǎo*.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) "The *pivot* is the essential" is supplemented from Jiao Hong’s edition.
(2) "With" and "again" are emended to "this" following the Song edition.
(3) "That" is emended to "again" following Jiao Hong’s edition.
(4) "Then the world" is supplemented from Jiao Hong’s edition.

Is it acceptable? Is it unacceptable? The Dao is enacted and thereby completed. Things are named and thereby affirmed. Why is it affirmed? It is affirmed as affirmed. Why is it not affirmed?

"Not affirmed as not affirmed. Things inherently have what they affirm, things inherently have what they approve. There is nothing that is not affirmed, nothing that is not approved. Thus, I cite the stalk and the pillar, the leper and Xi Shi, the expansive and the cunning, the strange and the monstrous—all are pervaded by the Dao and united as one. Their division is their formation; their formation is their destruction. For all things, there is no formation or destruction, but they return to being pervaded and united as one. Only the enlightened know this unity, and for this reason, they do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary. The ordinary is employment; employment is pervasion; pervasion is attainment. Attaining this, one is nearly there. Proceeding from this is sufficient. Proceeding thus without knowing why it is so is called the Dao. To exhaust one’s spirit and clarity in uniting them while not knowing their sameness is called 'morning three.' What is 'morning three'? The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, 'Three in the morning and four in the evening,' and all the monkeys were angry. He then said, 'Then four in the morning and three in the evening,' and all the monkeys were pleased. Names and realities were not diminished, yet joy and anger were employed—this too proceeds from this. Therefore, the sage harmonizes them with right and wrong and rests in the celestial potter’s wheel. This is called 'walking the two paths.'"

"The *tíng* (莛) is pronounced *tíng* in Xu’s reading and *tǐng* in Li’s. Sima [Biao] says: it is a roof beam. The *yíng* (楹) is pronounced *yíng*. Sima says: it is a roof pillar." Yu Yue notes: "Sima takes *tíng* as a roof beam and *yíng* as a roof pillar, hence Guo [Xiang] says *tíng* is horizontal while *yíng* is vertical." However, the *Shuowen* states: *tíng* means a stem. The interpretation of *tíng* as a roof beam is not its original meaning. The *Hanshu*’s *Biography of Dongfang Shuo* records using a *tíng* to strike a bell, and the *Wenxuan*’s *Responding to the Guest’s Difficulties* writes *tíng* as *tíng*. Li’s annotation cites the *Shuo Yuan*: "To erect the world’s resonant bell and strike it with a *tíng*—how could it produce sound?" *Tíng* and *tíng* are interchangeable. Thus, in ancient texts, *tíng* refers to something small. *Tíng* and *yíng* are distinguished by size, just as *Lì* and *Xī Shī* are distinguished by beauty and ugliness. The old interpretation is incorrect.

"*Lì* (厉) is read as written, meaning 'ugly.' Li pronounces it *lài*. Sima says: it means 'leprosy.' *Xī Shī* (西施): Sima says she was *Xià Jī*.

Jia Shifu says: "Regarding 'can' and 'cannot,' 'so' and 'not so,' the enlightened discard them without use, yet lodge use within non-use—thus they are united as one. *Yíng zòng* (楹纵) is also written as *cóng* (从), both pronounced *jiōng*."

**9. Annotation:** Things may be scattered in one context yet complete in another.
**Exegesis:** Things may be scattered here yet complete there, illustrating that gathering and scattering are not constant—one cannot cling to fixed notions. This further elaborates the principle of non-duality.

**10. Annotation:** What I call completion, others may call destruction.
**Exegesis:** What is completion here may be destruction there. The application of things differs, as in the case of scattered fur forming a coat or felled trees becoming a house.

**11. Annotation:** Completion and destruction arise from self-perception without seeing the other. Thus, there is neither completion nor destruction, just as there is neither right nor wrong.
**Exegesis:** Completion and destruction, right and wrong, arise from partiality. Since completion and destruction are not fixed, and right and wrong have no basis, there is no completion or destruction—they are united as one.

**12. Exegesis:** *Yù* (寓) means 'to lodge,' and *yōng* (庸) means 'to employ.' Only those who grasp the Dao, concentrating their spirit in profound insight, can transcend dualistic bias and unite them as one. For this reason, they accomplish without claiming success, employ without conscious use, and lodge their function in the multitude of things.

**13. Annotation:** The enlightened are not confined to one side, so they spontaneously forget themselves and lodge their function in self-use. In self-use, all things flow smoothly and find their own fulfillment.
**Exegesis:** Those who achieve great deeds yet attribute success to others, who govern the multitudes yet lodge their function in the people—are they not sages? Thus, they respond without intention, their spirit unobstructed, embodying the Dao and attaining the profound pearl at the Red Waters.

**14. Annotation:** *Jī* (几) means 'exhaustive.' The ultimate principle is fully realized in self-attainment.
**Exegesis:** *Jī* means 'exhaustive.' Attainment is neither internal reliance on the self nor external reliance on things—it is without thought, without action, without learning, without dependence. Spontaneously attained, it has no origin, harmonizing with principle and thus exhausting its subtlety.
**Phonetic Annotation:** *Jī* (几) is pronounced *jī*, meaning 'exhaustive.' The same below."

Xu finished dressing and turned away.

**15. Annotation:** The enlightened follow without contrivance.
**Exegesis:** Those who grasp the Dao act without intention, remain without attachment. Thus, they follow right and wrong yet transcend right and wrong, follow self and other yet transcend self and other. They merely follow—how could they impose their feelings?

**16. Annotation:** When the enlightened follow, do they know they follow what is good and thus follow it? They do not know why they follow; they simply follow spontaneously—this is called the Dao.
**Exegesis:** "Thereupon" signifies continuity from what precedes. The perfected person, free of intention, responds to stimuli as a bright mirror or an empty valley reflects all things. They follow the myriad beings, echo the multitudes, yet know not why they do so or why they respond. How could they harbor feelings of approval or disdain, or be bound by gain and loss? To model oneself after others—this is the Dao of spontaneity.
**Phonetic Annotation:** *"Called the Dao"*—Xiang and Guo treat this as a full stop. Cui reads *"called the Dao’s labor,"* explaining: following nature is the Dao’s work.

**17. Exegesis:** The mysterious Dao is wondrously one, ever serene and undisturbed—not unified through the labor of mind or intellect. Yet fools exhaust their spirit in chance debates, seeking unity. They differ not from those who fail to attain unity and are thus unworthy of reliance. Not knowing the supreme principle, they remain unaware that principle unifies itself—how could unity require the imposition of intention?

**18. Exegesis:** This introduces a parable.
◎ Jia Shifu notes: *"Called ‘morning three’"* clarifies that "morning three" is the point. Since the acorns are distributed in the morning, the monkeys rejoice at four but rage at three—both judgments fixate on a single corner. Thus, this is called "following."

**19. Annotation:** When the enlightened attain unity, do they labor their spirit? If one exhausts their spirit to achieve unity, they are unworthy of reliance and differ not from those who fail to attain unity. They are like the deluded monkeys, following their preferences and insisting on their own rightness.
**Exegesis:** This explains the parable. *Ju* (狙) means macaque. *Fu* (赋) means to distribute. *Xu* (芧) are acorns, resembling chestnuts but smaller. *Liezi* states: In Song there was an old man who kept monkeys and understood their ways. He teased them, saying: *"I will give you acorns—three in the morning and four in the evening. Is that enough?"* The monkeys rose in anger. He then said: *"I will give you four in the morning and three in the evening. Is that enough?"* The monkeys all prostrated themselves in delight. Morning three and evening four, morning four and evening three—both sum to seven. The name is unchanged, the quantity undiminished, yet they alternate between joy and rage, so foolish and deluded. They, too, follow their preferences and insist on their own rightness. Likewise, those who exhaust their minds, embellish their words, and forcibly unify the myriad things—how do they differ from the deluded monkeys?
**Phonetic Annotation:** *"Ju Gong"* (狙公): seven *xu* rhyme, also *zīlǜ* rhyme. Sima explains: *Ju Gong* is the official in charge of monkeys. Cui explains: one who raises apes and monkeys. Li explains: an old monkey. *Guangya* states: *ju* means macaque. *"Fu xu"* (赋芧): *xù* rhyme, Xu reads *shí rǔ*, Li reads *yǔ*. Sima explains: acorns. *"Morning three, evening four"* (朝三暮四): Sima explains: three measures in the morning, four in the evening. *"Preferences"* (所好): *hūbào* rhyme. The same below.

**20. Annotation:** Without partiality, one entrusts all to spontaneous equilibrium.
**Exegesis:** *Tianjun* (天均) is the principle of natural balance. The sage who grasps the Dao, empty and unattached, harmonizes right with non-right, unites wrong with non-wrong. Thus, they rest their intellect in the realm of equilibrium and still their heart in the境 of spontaneity.
**Phonetic Annotation:** *"Tianjun"* (天钧): also written as *Tianjun* (天均). Cui explains: *jun* means potter’s wheel.

**21. Annotation:** Entrusting oneself to the world’s right and wrong.
**Exegesis:** Not departing from right and wrong yet transcending right and wrong—this is called "walking both paths."
**Collation Notes:**
(1) The Zhao Jiayi edition omits *"ge"* (各).
(2) *"Lai"* (赖) is amended following the annotation below.

The ancients—their knowledge reached its utmost.
Wherein did it reach its utmost?

There are those who hold that things have never yet begun to exist—this is the utmost, the ultimate, to which nothing can be added. Next are those who hold that things exist, yet boundaries have never yet arisen. Next are those who hold that boundaries exist, yet right and wrong have never yet arisen. The manifestation of right and wrong is the reason the Dao suffers loss. The reason the Dao suffers loss is that attachment takes shape. Is there truly completion and loss? Is there truly no completion and loss? Where there is completion and loss, this is why Master Zhao plays the zither; where there is no completion and loss, this is why Master Zhao does not play the zither. Master Zhao’s playing of the zither, Master Kuang’s tapping of his baton, and Master Hui’s leaning against the catalpa tree—these three men’s knowledge reached its utmost, all being at their peak, and thus their deeds are recorded at life’s end.

Only because they were fond of it did they differ from others; because they were fond of it, they desired to make it clear. Yet what they sought to make clear was not something that could be made clear, and so they ended in the obscurity of "hard and white." Moreover, Master Zhao’s son spent his life following the threads of his father’s art, yet in the end achieved nothing. Could this be called achievement? Even I, too, would have achieved something. Could this not be called achievement? Then neither things nor I have achieved anything.

Thus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. To act without employing it yet lodge it in the ordinary—this is called "illuminating through clarity."

Though Zhao Wen had mastered the art of zither-playing, how could two others share the same skill? Moreover, upon examining the records, there is no mention of Hui Zi’s proficiency in the zither. As for "leaning on the wu," it merely refers to resting one’s arms upon a wu-table while discoursing—akin to those who recline upon a low table. *Ji* means "exhaustion." Zhao Wen excelled in zither-playing, Shi Kuang possessed a sublime understanding of musical harmony, and Hui Shi delighted in debating names and principles. The natures of these three men were endowed by Heaven, each employing their own abilities to illuminate the world. Yet the world remained unmoved, and they themselves grew weary, leading them to prop up their staffs and doze or rest their heads upon the table in slumber. Thus, the full extent of their abilities was exhausted in this manner.

Zhao Wen’s son, in turn, carried on his father’s legacy to its end, yet ultimately achieved nothing. Moreover, if these three could be called accomplished, then even I—lacking such accomplishment—could also be deemed accomplished. Thus, neither things nor I have achieved anything.

This dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. The sage does not display this to dazzle others, nor does he abandon himself to chase after things. Instead, he follows along, allowing each to obscurely fulfill its own capacity. Thus, he achieves partial completion without omission. Now, these three men sought to illuminate others with their own preferences—was this not delusion?

For the sage is one who has transcended the self.

Thus, when faced with the dazzling confusion of doubt, one maps and bounds it; when encountering the vast and strange, one unifies and harmonizes it. Allowing each of the myriad differences to rest in what they find restful, and the multitude of people not to lose what they deem right—then the self is not employed by things, and the uses of the myriad things are fully realized. When all things employ themselves, who is right and who is wrong? Therefore, even in the face of unbridled transformations and the peculiar and extraordinary, by bending to follow them and entrusting them to their own use, though their uses may be myriad and diverse, they become distinctly clear of themselves.

The sage, in harmony with Heaven and Earth in virtue, matches the sun and moon in brightness. Thus, he conceals his traces to blend with the common, veils his brilliance to engage with things, never dazzling the multitude nor confusing the people. Nor does he pride himself to lead others, but rather sets boundaries within each one’s allotted part, forgetting his concerns to accord with the myriad things, thereby entrusting use to the multitude of talents. Such a way of directing the mind may truly be called sagely illumination and genuine understanding.

Now, let there be words here—are they of the same kind as this, or not?

Whether they be of the same kind or not, if they are taken together as a kind, then they differ in no way from those. Yet, though it be so, let me attempt to speak of it.

There is that which has a beginning; there is that which has not yet begun to have a beginning; there is that which has not yet begun to have that which has not yet begun to have a beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which has not yet begun to have non-being; there is that which has not yet begun to have that which has not yet begun to have non-being.

Suddenly, there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly being or truly non-being. Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know whether what I have spoken is truly speech or truly not speech.

In all the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives longer than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu died prematurely. Heaven and Earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.

Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since we have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding from this, even the cleverest reckoner cannot reach an end—how much less can ordinary people! Therefore, from non-being to being, we arrive at three—how much more if we proceed from being to being! Do not proceed thus; follow this instead.

[11] **Commentary:** To say there is no right or wrong is itself another assertion.
**Exegesis:** *Jifu* (即复) is read as *fúyòu* (扶又反).

[12] **Commentary:** Yet one does not know whether such speech pertains to being or non-being, and thus the mind becomes utterly free of even the slightest trace of attachment.
**Exposition:** *Wei* (谓) means "speech." Master Zhuang again refrains from speaking. Though the principle emerges through verbal instruction—such as the earlier request to "try speaking"—once this speech is employed to elucidate the principle, one cannot determine whether such speech is definitively speech or definitively not speech. This is to show that the realm of principle transcends both silence and speech, just as teaching transcends both non-being and being. Fearing that scholars might become attached to words, he thus expresses himself in this manner.
**Exegesis:** *Xiānjiè* (纤介) is read as *gǔmài* (古迈反), or alternatively as *jiè* (界).
**Note by Lu Wenchang:** In modern editions, *jiè* (介) is written as *jiè* (芥).

[13] **Commentary:** When things are compared by form, a great mountain is indeed greater than the tip of an autumn hair. Yet if each abides by its own nature and attains its utmost, then a large form is not excessive, nor is a small form deficient. If each is sufficient in its nature, then the tip of an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, nor is a great mountain merely great in its greatness. If sufficiency in nature is deemed greatness, then nothing in the world is more sufficient than the tip of an autumn hair; if sufficiency in nature is not deemed greatness, then even a great mountain may be called small. Thus it is said: "Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small." If a great mountain is small, then nothing in the world is great; if the tip of an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Without small or great, without long life or early death, the cicada does not envy the great *chun* tree but rejoices in its own contentment, and the marsh pheasant does not prize the celestial pond but finds glory in its own sufficiency. If one is content with Heaven’s natural endowment and at peace with one’s nature and destiny, then even Heaven and Earth are not long-lived enough to surpass one’s own birth, and the myriad things are not distinct enough to differ from one’s own attainment. Thus, how could the birth of Heaven and Earth not be simultaneous with mine, and how could the attainment of the myriad things not be one with mine?
**Exposition:** In autumn, animals grow fine hair, the tip of which is exceedingly minute—hence the term "tip of an autumn hair." A child who dies in infancy is called a *shāngzǐ* (殇子). *Tài* (太) means "great." All things, in their arising, differ in form and *qi*: some are small, some large, some short-lived, some long-lived. Yet if we speak in terms of their nature, none is not self-sufficient. Thus, if sufficiency in nature is deemed greatness, nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair; if having no excess is deemed smallness, nothing in the world is smaller than a great mountain. If a great mountain is small, then nothing in the world is great; if the tip of an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Just as small and great are thus, so too are early death and long life. Therefore, though the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) are vast, their nature is equal in sufficiency; though the myriad things are numerous, their principle of self-attainment is one. Previously, it was shown that there is no end or beginning, no being or non-being; here, it is shown that there is no small or great, no early death or long life.

Here is the translation:

**Exegetical Notes:**
*"Autumn hair"* (秋豪) is read as written. According to the character, it should be written as *háo* (毫). Sima [Biao] says: rabbit fur forms in autumn. Wang Yi’s commentary on the *Chu Ci* states: it refers to fine hair. Since hair becomes soft and fine in autumn, it is used as a metaphor for smallness.
*"Great mountain"* (大山) is pronounced *tài*.
*"Short-lived child"* (殇子) refers to one who dies young. Some say: those who die before nineteen are called *shāng*.

**[14] [Commentary]**
The myriad things, though myriad in form, are the same in self-attainment—their attainment is one. Having already attained oneness, there is no principle to speak of.

**[15] [Commentary]**
Names and terms arise from what is not understood. When things cannot clarify their own oneness and instead pursue one another, they are called "one" to correct them. Once called "one," this is already speech.

**[Exegesis]**
The mysterious Dao is silent, its principle beyond form and sound. To guide the lost, terms and names arise. Thus, though the One is the profound origin, it remains within the realm of names and teachings. If it is called "one," how can it be said to be without speech?

**[16] [Commentary]**
To speak of the One with speech—yet the One is not speech—is to make the One and speech two. The One is already one; speech makes it two. With one and two, can this not be called three? To speak of the One with one word is already to reach three; how much more so when tracing its branches and the myriad things’ diverse names? Even with skilled calculation, none can enumerate them. Thus, those who speak of the One do not differ from others, while those who forget the One attain oneness without speech.

**[Exegesis]**
The wondrous principle of the One is beyond speech; thus, to speak of the One is not the One. The One is already one; speech speaks of it again. With one and speech, two names arise. Comparing the later two names to the earlier wondrous One, with one and two, can this not be called three? From three onward, even one skilled in calculation cannot count the numbers—how much less can ordinary people!


**[Exegetical Notes:]**
*"Diverse names"* (殊称) is read *shū zhèng*.
*"Skilled calculation"* (善数) is read *shàn shǔ*.

**[17] [Commentary]**
The One is without speech; with speech, it reaches three. How much more when tracing its endless numbers—can they be exhausted?

**[Exegesis]**
*Self* (自) means "from"; *proceed* (适) means "to go." The ultimate principle is without speech; speech gives rise to names. Thus, from no speech to speech, as soon as speech arises, it reaches three. How much more from speech to speech, where branches flow and diverge—can they be exhausted? This shows that all myriad dharmas originally have no names; from nothing, they arise, and thus reach this state.

**[18] [Commentary]**
Each rests in what it can do—this is most correct.

**[Exegesis]**
All dharmas are empty and illusory—why single out names and speech? Thus, non-being is not truly non-being, and being is not truly being. Names and numbers of being and non-being are all quiescent in themselves. Since they do not proceed from non-being to being, how could they proceed from being to being? Thus, there is no need to deliberate on going or coming; one simply follows the nature of things.

The Dao has never had boundaries; speech has never had constancy. Yet for the sake of this, there are demarcations—let us speak of these demarcations: there is left, there is right; there are relationships, there are duties; there are divisions, there are distinctions; there is competition, there is contention—these are called the Eight Virtues. Beyond the Six Directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discuss; within the Six Directions, the sage discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the chronicles of former kings’ aspirations—the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, division implies what is not divided; distinction implies what is not distinguished.

It is asked: Why? The sage embraces it; the multitude debates it to show one another. Thus, it is said: distinction implies what is not seen.

The great Dao is not named; great disputation does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage is not aggressive. When the Dao is made manifest, it is not the Dao; when speech is disputatious, it does not reach; when benevolence is constant, it does not succeed; when integrity is pure, it is not trusted; when courage is aggressive, it does not succeed. These five nearly approach the proper direction. Thus, to know to stop where one does not know—this is perfection.

Who knows the disputation of no speech, the Dao of no Dao? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Treasury. Pour into it and it is not filled; draw from it and it is not exhausted. Yet one does not know whence it comes—this is called the Preserved Light.

**[1] [Commentary]**
It is obscurely present everywhere.

**[Exegesis]**
The Dao is present everywhere, and wherever it is present, there is nothing. Vast and unbounded, what boundaries could it have?

**[Exegetical Notes:]**
Cui [Zhuan] says: In the "Equalizing Things" chapter, this connects to the preceding chapter, yet Ban Gu places it in the Outer Chapters.

**[2] [Commentary]**
From differing perspectives, thus right and wrong have no fixed standard.

**[Exegesis]**
The Dao’s principle is empty and all-pervading, without limit or boundary. Therefore, teachings adapt to things, and no constant standard abides.

**[3] [Commentary]**
The Dao has no boundaries, so the myriad things freely follow their own divisions.

**[Exegesis]**
*Zhen* means boundary. Since principle has no edge or limit, and teachings shift with things, what is deemed "right" varies, and divisions differ.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Wei shi* (為是): *yu wei* (于伪) pronunciation.
*You zhen* (有畛): Xu’s *zhi ren* (之忍) pronunciation; Guo and Li’s *zhen* (真) pronunciation. Refers to boundaries and divisions.

**[4] [Exegesis]**
This sets forth a hypothetical question to introduce what follows.

**[5] [Commentary]**
Each suits its own convenience.

**[Exegesis]**
Left pertains to yang; right to yin. Though principle is serene and still, teachings must follow the moment. Divisions differ, and ascents and descents vary, hence east and west, left and right, spring and autumn, life and death.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*You zuo you you* (有左有右): Cui’s version reads *you* (宥), meaning "to be at ease." ◎Lu Wenchang notes: The old text mistakenly reads *you* (有); the following line reads *zai you* (在宥), so it clearly should be *you* (宥). Now corrected.
*Yi bian* (异便): *bi mian* (婢面) pronunciation.

**[6] [Commentary]**
Each thing has its principle; each affair has its fitting course.

**[Exegesis]**
*Lun* means principle; *yi* means fitting. Amid the tangled throng of things, principle resides; among the varied affairs of the world, each follows what is fitting and convenient.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*You lun you yi* (有伦有义): Cui’s version reads *you lun you yi* (有论有议). ◎Yu Yue notes: The *Exegetical Notes* state that Cui’s version reads *you lun you yi* (有论有议), which should be followed. Below, it says: "Beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate." It also says: "Thus, division is where there is no division; disputation is where there is no disputation." What is called *fen bian* (分辩) there corresponds to *you fen you bian* (有分有辩) here; thus, what is called *lun yi* (论议) there corresponds to *you lun you yi* (有论有议) here.

**[7] [Commentary]**
Grouped by kind and distinguished by category.

**[Exegesis]**
*Bian* means to distinguish. Though birds and beasts are many, each has its group; though the natures of things are myriad, each follows its own kind.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*You fen* (有分): Pronounced as written. The commentary is the same.
*Lei bie* (类别): *bi lie* (彼列) pronunciation. The same below.

**[8] [Commentary]**
Pursuing together is called *jing*; contending in debate is called *zheng*.

**[Exegesis]**
The natures of things are dull and foolish; each clings to its own boundaries. Thus, they pursue victory and defeat together, contending over right and wrong.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*You zheng* (有争): The *zheng* of strife. The commentary is the same.

**[9] [Commentary]**
Summarizing and distinguishing them, these eight virtues emerge.

**[Exegesis]**
*De* is the name for function. The functions of living things transform endlessly; summarizing them, these eight kinds appear. This explains the meaning of *you zhen* (有畛) above.

**[10] [Commentary]**
Beyond the six directions refers only to what lies outside the inherent nature of things. Though principle exists beyond the nature of things, it does not pertain to what lies within their nature, and thus does not move the sage. Therefore, the sage does not discuss it. If he were to discuss it, he would be leading the myriad things to learn what they cannot. Thus, he does not discuss what lies beyond, and the eight divisions become one in self-attainment.

**[Exegesis]**
The six directions are heaven, earth, and the four quarters. Beyond the six directions lies what is outside the inherent nature of living things, the realm of the profoundly mysterious Dao. The profound source transcends the bounds of the four propositions; the wondrous principle is beyond the six directions. Since it cannot be debated by the divine mouth, it is preserved but not discussed.

**[11] [Commentary]**
Expounding their natures and settling them.

**[Exegesis]**
Within the six directions lies the inherent nature bestowed upon living things. All preferences and aversions arise from deluded feelings; tracing their root, they are equally empty. The sage responds to their impulses, expounding accordingly. Since it is based on emptiness, there is nothing to debate in detail. Thus, below it says, "I too speak deludedly."

**[12] [Commentary]**
Following their established traces and congealing at the ultimate of rightness, not clinging to what one deems right to condemn others.

**[Exegesis]**
*Chun qiu* refers to eras; *jing* to canons. The former kings were the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. *Zhi* means to record. Those who took Xuanyuan and Zhuanxu as their ancestors, who took Yao and Shun as their models, who recorded eras to create canons, who guided living people and transmitted them through the world—though the sage’s discussions benefited their times, he ultimately did not cling to right or debate wrong, nor stagnate in established traces.

**[13] [Commentary]**
Each thing divides itself; each affair distinguishes itself. To wish to impose one’s own divisions is to fail to see their self-distinction.

**[Exegesis]**
Principle has no division, yet things have right and wrong. Thus, within what has no boundary or division, there arise views of division and disputation. These belong to one-sided scholars and stagnant people—how could they analyze the subtle or distinguish affairs?

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Gu fen* (故分): Pronounced as written. The same below and in the commentary.

**[14] [Exegesis]**
A hypothetical question to raise doubts and develop meaning.

**[15] [Commentary]**
To harbor no disputation is the sage’s embrace; the sage has no embrace.

**[Exegesis]**
The sage who comprehends principle unites mind with the Dao. Thus, he can embrace self and others, encompass right and wrong, like withered wood or dead ash, utterly without distinction.

**[16] [Commentary]**
Not seeing their self-disputation, he disputes what he knows to show them.

**[Exegesis]**
The multitude of people is but another name for sentient beings. Ordinary and deluded, they cling to their ignorance, failing to comprehend emptiness and delusion. Thus, they dispute what they know and display their perceptions of things. Not only do they fail to see how others distinguish themselves, but they also do not reflect upon their own subtle Dao. Hence, it is said there are things they do not see.

**[17] [Commentary]**
Entrusting it to self-reference, there is nothing to be called.

**[Exegesis]**
The great Dao is vast and empty, wondrously beyond form and name. Since it is neither color nor sound, it cannot be named. Those who embody the Dao are likewise silent.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Bu cheng* (不稱): Pronounced *chǐ zhèng* in the fanqie system; the same applies to the commentary.

**[18] [Commentary]**
They distinguish themselves.

**[Exegesis]**
Having awakened to the true source, there is nothing to be said. Thus, though they carve and adorn the myriad things, their words amount to silence.

**[19] [Commentary]**
Existing without attachment.

**[Exegesis]**
Nurturing all beings, they overflow with boundless love yet remain without intention—like the verdant spring, not acting out of benevolence.

**[20] [Commentary]**
For one who is utterly sufficient, the coming and going of things is not of the self. Thus, there is no room for conceit or satisfaction.

**[Exegesis]**
Those who profoundly awaken see through both emptiness and existence, knowing the myriad realms to be illusory and not a single thing worth coveting. Both self and other are empty—what is there to yield or relinquish?

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Bu qiàn* (不嗛): Pronounced *qī diàn* in the fanqie system according to Guo; *qiān* according to Xu.

**[21] [Commentary]**
Without direction, there is no movement that is not harmonious—thus, no peril is beyond traversing.

**[Exegesis]**
*Zhì* means opposition. Within, they harbor boundless compassion; without, they extend it to all beings. Thus, they humbly align with the dust of the world, bestowing grace to save the multitudes. Emptying the self to meet each moment, they never act in discord.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Bù zhì* (不忮): Xu’s fanqie reads *zhī shì*; alternatively *qí*, or Li’s *zhī yí*. "Harm" or "injury." Li: "vigorous."

**[22] [Commentary]**
To illuminate this by that is to lose both.

**[Exegesis]**
Parading one’s merit and fame before others—this is mere excess and deceit, not the true Dao.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Dào zhāo* (道昭): pronounced *zhào*.

**[23] [Commentary]**
Unable to reach the measure of one’s inherent nature.

**[Exegesis]**
Failing in profound silence, they remain mired in names and words, their ornate phrases and hollow arguments never penetrating deep principle.

**[24] [Commentary]**
Things bear no constant affection; to cling to constant affection is to fail in universality.

**[Exegesis]**
Unable to forget attachment or relinquish knowledge, to merge self and other in profound unity, they persist in harboring kindness and clinging to kinship. Aspiring to success, they find no moment to realize it.

**[25] [Commentary]**
Radiant purity and unyielding integrity—these belong to the covetous of reputation, not to true integrity.

**[Exegesis]**
Standing aloof from the world, towering above the crowd, their intent lies in fame, not in genuine integrity.

**[26] [Commentary]**
The bravery of opposition and defiance is loathed by all under heaven; no ground remains for them to tread.

**[Exegesis]**
Abandoning compassion for boldness, they defy the sentiments of all beings. Hated by the multitude, they can achieve nothing.

**[27] [Commentary]**
These five—all inflict harm by striving after the external, unable to rest in their original nature. To seek without end what cannot be sought is like a circle emulating a square, or a fish yearning to soar as a bird. Though they aspire to phoenixes and model themselves on sun and moon, the closer they draw to such ideals, the farther they stray from reality. The more they learn, the more their nature is lost. Thus, when all things are equalized, the burden of partiality vanishes.

**[Exegesis]**
*Wán* means "round." *Jī* means "near." The five refer to the preceding *Dào zhāo* and the like. Those who study the Dao must conceal their brilliance; yet they flaunt their abilities and display them before the world—how distant this is from the Dao! It is like admiring squares while learning circles, or loving flight while delighting in swimming. Though they long for phoenixes, they will never gain the power of soaring; though they model themselves on sun and moon, how can they achieve even a fraction of their efficacy?

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Wán* (): Cui’s pronunciation *wán*; Xu’s *wǔ wán*. Sima: "round." Guo: *tuán*.
*Ér jī* (而几): Xu’s fanqie *qí yī*.
*Xiàng fāng* (向方): also written *xiàng*, same pronunciation. Below follows this pattern.
*Jìn bǐ* (近彼): "near" as in proximity.
*Yuǎn shí* (远实): *yú wàn*.

**[28] [Commentary]**
What lies beyond knowing belongs to the realm outside one’s inherent nature. Thus, to halt within the bounds of what one knows is to reach perfection.

**[Exegesis]**
Realms vary in magnitude, wisdom in clarity and obscurity. What lies beyond one’s wisdom need not be forcibly known. To know one’s limit is the ultimate achievement in learning.

**[29] [Commentary]**
Vast and unencumbered, they entrust all to spontaneity.

**[Exegesis]**
*Shú* means "who." *Tiān* means "nature." Who knows the wordless words, the Dao that is not a Dao? Those who accumulate such discernment to connect with all things may be said to unite with the treasury of nature.

**[30] [Commentary]**
The heart of the perfected is like a mirror: it responds but does not retain. Thus, it remains vast and unaltered by gain or loss.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Zhù yān* (注焉): Xu’s fanqie *zhī yù*.

**[31] [Commentary]**
The advent of the supreme principle is naturally without trace.

**[Exegesis]**
The vast ocean, profound and boundless, defies measurement of its shores. A hundred rivers pour into it without filling it; the Tailuo abyss drains it without exhausting it. The great sage who embodies the Dao is likewise: myriad affairs arise without disturbing their spirit, a thousand difficulties confront them without unsettling their thoughts. Thus, they embrace all existence and harbor all beings. It is like a mirror hung high in a hall—things come, and it reflects them. The wisdom that enables reflection knows not whence it arises. This may be called reflecting while forgetting, forgetting while reflecting.

**[32] [Commentary]**
Entrusting it to its own clarity, its light is never dimmed.

**[Exegesis]**
*Bǎo* means "concealment." To forget while reflecting, to reflect while forgetting—thus they veil their light, and their light grows ever brighter. This concludes the preceding discussion of the treasury of heaven.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Bǎo guāng* (葆光): pronounced *bǎo*. Cui: "as if present, as if absent—this is called *bǎo guāng*."

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) The missing character in *quèwù* is rendered as *zhōu* in the Jiangnan ancient manuscript.

Thus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: “I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when facing south I remain unsettled. What is the reason for this?”

Shun replied: “Those three lords still dwell among the weeds and brambles. Why should you be unsettled? In ancient times, when ten suns appeared together, all things were illuminated—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun!”

**[1] [Commentary]**
His grasp of the Dao of tranquil acceptance was not yet expansive, so he felt no joy while holding court. To convey the principle of luminous unity, he posed this self-questioning query to prompt the Great Sage’s response.

**[Exegesis]**
*Shìrán* describes a joyful countenance. Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao were the names of three minor frontier states during Yao’s reign. “Facing south” signifies the ruler’s position. Shun was the sixth-generation descendant of Zhuanxu. His father was Gu Sou, his mother Wu Deng, and he was conceived when she was moved by a great rainbow. Born at Yao Village, he took the surname Yao; dwelling by the Gui River, he was also called Gui. His eyes had double pupils, so he was styled Chong Hua. Renowned for his benevolence and filial piety in his village, Yao heard of his virtue, gave him his two daughters in marriage, and enfeoffed him at Yu. At thirty, he oversaw the hundred offices; at thirty-three, he received Yao’s abdication. After ascending the throne, he established his capital at Puban. He ruled for forty years before yielding to Yu. Later, he passed away and was buried in the wilds of Cangwu. As the three states had failed in tribute, punishment was warranted, yet the matter remained unresolved, so he felt no joy while holding court. To illustrate the principle of the unity of all things, he framed the dialogue between the two sages.

**Annotations and Text:**

《宗脍》: *Zongkuai* (Xu: "gu" as in "ancient," "wai" reversed)
《胥》: *Xu* (Xu: "xi" as in "xu")
*Huaxu* state.
《敖》: *Ao* (Xu: "wu" as in "five," "gao" as in "high")
Sima [Biao] says: *Zong*, *Kuai*, and *Xuao* are the names of three states.
Cui [Zhuan] says: *Zong* is one, *Kuai* is two, *Xuao* is three.
《听朝》: *Ting chao* (Xu: "zhi" as in "distant," "yao" reversed)

**Section Two**
**Note:** That in which things find repose is not base; thus, the mugwort and artemisia are the wondrous abodes of the Three Lords.
《妙处》: *Miao chu* (Xu: "chang" as in "anxiety," "lü" reversed)

**Section Three**
**Exegesis:** The Three Lords are the rulers of the three states. Mugwort and artemisia are humble grasses, yet even the sparrow finds them sufficient for its carefree wandering. How much more, though the lands of these lords be modest, are they not enough for the Three Lords to nurture themselves? Yet they remain unsettled—what is the meaning of this?

**Section Four**
**Note:** When the double brightness ascends to heaven, the Six Directions are all illumined; there is no mugwort or artemisia that is not bathed in its light.
《重明》: *Chong ming* (Xu: "zhi" as in "dragon," "long" reversed)
《光被》: *Guang bei* (Xu: "pi" as in "skin," "ji" reversed)

**Section Five**
**Note:** Though the sun and moon shine without partiality, there are still places they do not reach; virtue, however, attains all. Now, to seize the aspirations of the mugwort and artemisia and force them to comply—how could this be vast in the utmost Dao? Thus, the spirit remains unresolved. If things flow according to their nature, each resting in what it finds restful, whether distant or near, hidden or deep, left to their own course, all attain their fullness—then nothing is amiss for them, and nothing is not joyful for me.

**Exegesis:** "Advance" means to transgress. The *Huainanzi* states: In ancient times, during Yao’s reign, ten suns appeared together, scorching the crops, killing the grasses and trees, and causing the giant boars and long serpents to become harms to the people. Thereupon, Yao sent Yi to shoot the ten suns; he brought down nine of them. Below, he slew the long serpents to rid the people of harm. When the ten suns ascend to heaven, the Six Directions are all illumined, yet beneath the overturned basin, hidden places remain unlit. But where the sagely virtue reaches, no darkness is left unillumined. To wield these two wisdoms and surpass the Three Luminaries, then to raise weapons and force compliance—how could this be called the vast and unobstructed Way of tranquil acceptance?

◎ Jia Shifu says: To attack a state is the accumulation of views on right and wrong. Yet here, there is an unresolved feeling, as the distinctions of human relations, righteousness, debate, and contention wage war within and go unrecognized. As for the Three Lords, amid the mugwort and artemisia, they do not engage in debate to distinguish themselves. All things receive the sun’s illumination and cannot escape its form; yet if one were to burden it with ten suns, all seeking to illuminate the myriad things, the spirits of the myriad things would surely be exhausted. The sun’s illumination is without intent. To seek to distinguish right and wrong with virtue, and moreover to do so with intent, is to surpass even the sun’s illumination. Where, then, can one place one’s hands and feet?

◎ Qing Fan’s collation: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Xie Lingyun’s poem "On Traveling to Jingkou’s Beigu, in Response to an Imperial Edict" cites Sima [Biao] as saying: When the yang brilliance (light) adorns the heavens, there is nothing it does not illumine. The *Annotations* omit this.
《神解》: *Shen jie* (Xu: pronounced "xie")
**Collation:** (1) The character "light" is amended according to the original text of the *Wen Xuan* commentary.

Nie Que asked Wang Ni, “Do you know wherein all things are alike in their rightness?”

**Section One**
**Exegesis:** Nie Que was the teacher of Xu You and a disciple of Wang Ni, both worthy men of Yao’s time. Through these two, the principle of equality is illustrated. Things are inverted in their sentiments, each holding to its own views and differing from others; all deem themselves right and others wrong. Do you know whether this is so or not?
《啮》: *Nie* (Xu: "wu" as in "five," "jie" reversed)
《缺》: *Que* (Xu: "qiu" as in "hill," "yue" reversed)
《王倪》: *Wang Ni* (Xu: "wu" as in "five," "ji" reversed; Li: pronounced "yi")
The *Lives of Eminent Recluses* states: Wang Ni was a worthy man of Yao’s time. The *Heaven and Earth* chapter says he was Nie Que’s teacher.

Wang Ni said, “How would I know?”

**Section One**
**Note:** What is alike is not necessarily right, and what differs is not uniquely wrong. Thus, neither self nor other can correct the other, and there is no use for knowledge.

**Exegesis:** Wang Ni answered Nie Que: “Each has its own right and wrong, resulting in no arbiter. If I were to use knowledge to know the other, my knowledge would still be right or wrong. So how would I know?” This means there is no use for knowledge.

**Nie Que asked, “Do you know what you do not know?”**

**Section One**
**Exegesis:** “Since you do not know wherein all things are alike in their rightness, do you at least know what you yourself do not know?” This is a step toward entering subtlety, a progression of thorough inquiry, using the master and disciple to reveal the profound meaning.

Wang Ni said, “How would I know?”

**Section One**
**Note:** If one knows what one does not know, this is already to have knowledge. Having knowledge, one cannot entrust things to their own rightness.

**Exegesis:** If one uses knowledge to know what one does not know, the “not knowing” is still knowledge. Thus, he reiterates, “How would I know?” and answers again with “not knowing.”

**“Then are things without knowledge?”**

**Section One**
**Exegesis:** He presses further: “Since you yourself have no knowledge, do things also lack knowledge?”

Wang Ni said, “How would I know?”

**Section One**
**Note:** To know nothing at all is to be vast and unburdened, leaving nothing unentrusted.

**Exegesis:** It is not only that I do not know; I also do not know things. Only when things and self, inner and outer, are all forgotten is there nowhere to apply knowledge.

**“Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing?”**

**Section One**
**Note:** Because he does not know, he does not dare to speak definitively but only tentatively.

**Exegesis:** *Ran hu* (然乎) means "nevertheless." Since there is no knowledge, in principle there is nothing to be said—nothing can be asserted with certainty, hence the tentative attempt.

**Note:** Fish swim in water, a capacity shared by all aquatic creatures, and all call this "knowing." Yet from a bird's perspective, what was called knowing is now not-knowing. The dung beetle's knowledge lies in rolling its ball, while those who mock it prize storax resin. Thus, what is commonly called knowledge cannot be taken as an absolute standard.

**Exegesis:** For some things, what is known here is unknown there, and what is known there is unknown here. Fish and birds, water and land—this is the meaning. Thus, knowing is not-knowing, and not-knowing is knowing. How could ordinary people comprehend this principle?

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Yong ju* (庸讵): Xu’s edition reads *ju* (巨). Guo pronounces it *ju*. Li explains: *yong* means "to use"; *ju* means "how"; together, they mean "what use is it?" Fu Qian says: *ju* means "not yet."
*Fu wei* (复为): Pronounced *fu you*.
*Jie* (蛣): Pronounced *qiu yi*.
*Qiang* (蜣): Pronounced *qiu liang*. The *Erya* states: *jie qiang* is the dung beetle.
**Note:** What is called "not-knowing" is simply a matter of difference—it is also a kind of knowing in its own right.

**Exegesis:** What is called "not-knowing" means only that there is no mutual understanding, not that there is no knowledge at all.

◎ Qingfan’s note: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Pan Anren’s *Autumn Stirrings Rhapsody* cites Sima’s gloss: *yong* means "what use is it?" This is omitted in the *Explanatory Notes*.
◎ Further note: *Yong ju* means "how could it be?" *Ju* and *ju* (距/巨) are interchangeable; sometimes written as *qu* (渠). Examples:
- *Records of the Grand Historian*, "Biography of Gan Mao": "How could you rebuke me?"
- *Huainanzi*, "Among People": "How could this not become good fortune?"
- *Han Feizi*, "Difficulties": "Why would Wei be so resistant?"
- *Xunzi*, "Proper Norms": "How could one with such fixed views consider being insulted as no disgrace?"
- *Xunzi*, "Regulations of a King": "How could they escape this burden?" All attest to this usage.

Moreover, I once tentatively asked you: when people sleep in dampness, they suffer from lumbar ailments and partial paralysis—is this so? When they dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—do apes and monkeys react thus? Among these three, who knows the correct dwelling? People eat domesticated animals, elk and deer eat fine grass, centipedes relish snakes, and owls delight in mice—among these four, who knows the correct flavor? Apes and monkeys take each other as mates, elk couple with deer, and mudfish swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji are considered beauties by humans; yet when fish see them, they dive deep, when birds see them, they fly high, and when elk and deer see them, they flee swiftly. Among these four, who knows the correct beauty of the world?

From my perspective, the origins of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I discern their distinctions?

**Annotations from Commentary:**
1. Since I do not know what is correct, I tentatively ask you.
2. This briefly cites three examples to illustrate the differing conveniences of the myriad things.
3. This briefly cites four examples to illustrate that beauty and ugliness have no fixed standard.
4. This briefly cites four examples to show that what the world favors differs. To condemn what differs is to have no way of knowing what is necessarily the same.

The *Shiwen* glosses:
- *Biān* (猵) is read with the *mian* (面) rhyme, Xu with the *fumian* (敷面) rhyme, or alternatively the *fuwei* (敷畏) rhyme; Guo and Li pronounce it as *piān* (偏).
- *Jū* (狙) is read with the *qiyu* (七余) rhyme.

Sima Biao states: *Jū* is also called *gézāng* (獦牂), resembling an ape but with a dog’s head, and it mates with female apes.
Cui states: *Biānjū* (猵狙) is another name for *gézāng*; the male mates with female apes.
Xiang Xiu states: *Biānjū* takes apes as its mates.
*Gé* (獦) is pronounced as *gé* (葛).

*As female* (為雌) is read as *qī* (妻), or alternatively as the character’s standard pronunciation.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Taiping Yulan* (910) cites Sima Biao: *Biānjū* resembles an ape but with a dog’s head, preys on macaques, and prefers to mate with male apes—differing from the citation in the *Shiwen*.

*Mao Qiang* (毛嫱) is read by Xu with the *zailiang* (在良) rhyme.
Sima Biao states: Mao Qiang was an ancient beauty, or alternatively, a favored concubine of the King of Yue.

*Li Ji* (麗姬) is read with the *lizhi* (力知) rhyme, consistent below.
Li Ji was the favored concubine of Duke Xian of Jin, later made his consort. Cui’s version reads *Xi Shi* (西施).

*Ju* (決) is read with the *xique* (喜缺) rhyme.
Li states: It denotes swiftness.
Cui states: To flee swiftly without looking back is called *ju* (決).
Xu reads it with the *guhui* (古惠) rhyme; Guo pronounces it as *guxue* (古穴).

*Zou* (驟) is read with the *shijiu* (士救) rhyme, or alternatively the *zaigou* (在遘) rhyme.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Jue zòu* (決驟) is synonymous with *jué zào* (決躁). (*Shuowen* and *Guangya* both define *zào* (躁) as swiftness.) The *Yi Jing* (*Xici Zhuan* [*Shuogua Zhuan*]) states: "It is decisive and swift" (*zào* [躁] being interchangeable with *zào* [躁]). The *Zhengyi* reads *jué zòu* (決驟), explaining it as embodying firmness and vigor. The proper character should be *jué qù* (趹趣). The *Shuowen* defines *jué* (趹) as the gait of a horse, and elsewhere as *tí* (踶, rearing). The *Huainanzi* (*Xiuwu*) reads *chì jué qù* (敕蹻趹), with Gao You’s note: *jué* (趹) means *qù* (趣, hastening). It is also interchangeable with *jué* (駃). The *Guangya* defines *jué* (駃) as galloping. The *Records of the Grand Historian* (*Zhang Yi Zhuan*) states: "Probing ahead and hastening behind, hooves spanning three *xun*." The *Suoyin* explains: "This describes the swiftness of a horse’s gait." This aligns with Cui’s definition of *ju* (決) as fleeing swiftly without looking back.

*What is favored* (所好) is read with the *huba* (呼報) rhyme.

**[5] Commentary:**
What benefits one may harm another, and since the "other" and "self" in the world are boundless, the contest of right and wrong knows no constancy. Thus, only by refraining from disputation and allowing each to be self-so does all attain a state of unobstructed harmony.

**Explication:**
All things are manifold yet never apart from the self. Thus, practicing benevolence and upholding righteousness yield differing gains and losses: what benefits me may harm another, and what is right for them may be wrong for me. Viewed from shifting perspectives of self and other, the paths of right and wrong, the threads of benevolence and righteousness, become tangled and confused—like a chaotic medley of dishes, devoid of fixed principles. How then can I discern their distinctions?

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Fánrán* (樊然) reads *fán* (烦).
*Yáoluàn* (殽乱) reads *hù jiāo* (户交) in Xu’s recension.
Guo [Pu] writes *sǎn* (散), reading *xī dàn* (悉旦).
◎Qing Fan’s note: *Yáo* (殽) in Guo’s text is incorrect. The *Shuowen* defines *yáo* (殽) as "mixed and jumbled," while *sǎn* (散) means "scattered meat." Their meanings do not align. (The character *zá* (杂) is a corruption of *lí* (离); see *Shuowen Kaozheng*.) In clerical script, *yáo* (殽) is sometimes written as □ (see the *Han Dynasty Xiaokeng Jun Shrine Stele*), resembling *sǎn* (散); *sǎn* (散) may also appear as □ (see *Li Xi’s Xiqiao Yifu Pavilion Inscription*), resembling *yáo* (殽). The confusion between *yáo* (殽) and *sǎn* (散) arises from their graphic similarity. The *Tai Xuan Jing* (*Yuan Ying*) states: "Day and night *yáo*—their fortunes and misfortunes intermingle." Modern editions erroneously write *sǎn* (散) for *yáo* (殽). The *Huainanzi* (*Yuandao*) reads: "Not mingling with things, to the utmost purity," and the *Jingshen* chapter: "Not mingling with things, and the world submits of itself." Modern editions both mistakenly write *sǎn* (散). (Gao You’s note: *Sǎn* (散) means "scattered appearance." Yet no classical text glosses *sǎn* (散) as "chaotic." Thus, *sǎn* (散) should uniformly be corrected to *yáo* (殽).)
*Zhī jìng* (之竟) reads *jìng* (境). Most modern editions write *jìng* (境); follow this below.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition omits *gù* (故).
(2) The Zhao edition omits the phrase "略举二字及以字之字."
(3) *Dòng* (动) is amended per the original text of the *Zhengyi*.
(4) *Hòu* (后) is supplied per the original text of the *Records of the Grand Historian*.

Nie Que said: "If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfect Person truly not know benefit and harm?"
**[1] Commentary:**
Not yet having attained the subtlety of non-knowing, one still suspects the Perfect Person ought to know. This is a knot yet untied.

**Explication:**
Nie Que, failing to grasp the mutual non-knowing of self and other, raises the doubt of benefit and harm. He asks: "You are a Perfect Person—should you not know benefit and harm? If you do not discern them, you wander in darkness like one lost at night." He poses this challenge, hoping for a further reply.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*Wèi jiě* (未解) reads *xiè* (蟹).

Wang Ni said: "The Perfect Person is divine! A great marsh may burn, yet they feel no heat; the Yellow River and Han River may freeze, yet they feel no cold; swift thunder may shatter mountains and whirlwinds shake the sea, yet they feel no alarm. Such a one rides the *qi* of clouds, **[3]** mounts the sun and moon, **[4]** and roams beyond the four seas. **[5]** Death and life bring no change to them—**[6]** how much less the mere threads of benefit and harm!" **[7]**
**[1] Commentary:**
Without intent, yet nothing is not accorded.

The *shu* (annotation) states: "Perfect" (*zhi*) refers to the wondrous ultimate substance; "divine" (*shen*) refers to its unfathomable function. The sage empties the self and responds to things without fixed form—knowing yet not knowing, disputing yet not disputing. How could one fathom the Perfect Person through names, words, thoughts, or conjectures!

**[2] Commentary:**
One whose spirit is whole and complete, whose body merges with things, though traversing the most extreme changes, never ceases to be oneself. Thus, the mind remains utterly unobstructed, free of even the slightest hindrance.

The *shu* (annotation) states: *Hù* means "to freeze." When marshes burn and rivers freeze, when thunder roars and shatters mountains, when whirlwinds surge and shake the seas—the Perfect Person, spirit congealed and unmanifest, body merging with things, remains untouched by water or fire as calamity, undisturbed by wind or thunder as terror.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*Hù* (冱) is read *hù* (户故反). Xu also reads *hù* (户各反). Li reads *hù* (户格反). Xiang says: "to freeze." Cui says: *Hù* means "to dry up."

◎ Jia Shifu says: Great floods may rise to the heavens without drowning them; great droughts may melt metal and stone, scorch mountains and earth without heating them. Able not to treat things as affairs, the workings of heaven and earth naturally abide in one’s heart—thus, external conditions cannot become burdens. This is how Zhuangzi envisioned himself, and so he repeatedly speaks of it.

*Chài* (虿) is read *chài* (敕迈反), also *zhì* (音豸). *Jiè* (介) is read *gài* (古迈反), also *jiè* (音界).

**[3] Commentary:**
Riding things to move, not moving oneself.

The *shu* (annotation) states: "Such being so"—that is, being thus. Empty and serene, without intent, like the *qi* of clouds, they shelter and nurture all beings, moving in accord with things.

**[4] Commentary:**
There is day and night, but no death and life.

The *shu* (annotation) states: The alternation of darkness and light brings the distinction of day and night; abiding in compliance and ease, there is no difference wrought by death and life. Yet they govern and bear all things, carrying the living—hence the name of "riding" and "mounting."

**[5] Commentary:**
Only by lacking knowledge and entrusting all things to their own course can one gallop through the ten thousand things without exhaustion.

The *shu* (annotation) states: Movement and stillness coincide, response and merging occur as one. Sitting upright at the center of the cosmos, the mind roams beyond the four seas.

**[6] Commentary:**
Taking change as their substance, death and life are as one.

**[7] Commentary:**
How much less can benefit and harm, compared to death and life, disturb the mind?

The *shu* (annotation) states: Benefit and harm are but gains and losses in the course of life. Since death and life are like day and night, riding transformation to roam freely—how could benefit and harm, compared to death and life, ever disturb the mind?

**Textual Note:**
The character *piāo* (飘) is supplied from Zhao Jianyi’s edition. The character *chài* (虿) is amended following the Shidetang edition.

Ququezi asked Master Changwu: "I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao; without speech, there is speech; with speech, there is no speech—and roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these careless words, but I regard them as the practice of the wondrous Dao. What do you think?"

**[1] Commentary:**
Affairs come of themselves, and principle responds of itself—one does not follow and engage with them.

The *shu* (annotation) states: "Affairs" means "matters." *Zhū* (诸) means "at." Quque was a disciple of Changwu, hence he called his teacher "the Master." The sage who embodies the Dao forgets the self and merges with things; though involved in affairs, they do not treat them as tasks. Dwelling amidst the dust of the world, utterly without intent—how could they fix their mind or harbor feelings, following after things? Quque, wishing to seek further instruction, thus recounted what he had heard before.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*Qúquè* (瞿鹊) is read *qújū* (其俱反). *Chángwúzi* (长梧子): Li says: "He dwelled beneath the long catalpa, hence the name." Cui says: "His name was Qiu." Jianwen says: "He was the border warden of Changwu." *Fūzǐ* (夫子): Xiang says: "Quque’s teacher."

◎ Yu Yue says: Ququezi must have been a figure after the seventy disciples, and the "Master" from whom he heard these words refers to Confucius. Below, Master Changwu says, "This is what the Yellow Emperor heard at Ying, yet how could Qiu (Confucius) know it?" Qiu is Confucius’ given name. Since Ququezi was recounting Confucius’ words, he said, "How could Qiu know it?" But readers, not grasping this, mistakenly took *Qiu* as Master Changwu’s own name, hence the *Shiwen* states: "Master Changwu, Cui says his name was Qiu." This is entirely incorrect. Below, it says, "Qiu and you are both dreaming; I say you are dreaming, but I am also dreaming." Here, *yú* (予) refers to Master Changwu himself. Having said "Qiu and you are both dreaming," and then "I am also dreaming"—how could *Qiu* be Master Changwu’s name?

**[2] Commentary:**
Advancing directly, without avoiding or seeking.

The *shu* (annotation) states: "Avoid" means "to shun."

Embracing the pivotal moments of adversity and prosperity as ordained by fate, and comprehending that profit and harm arise in their due seasons, one thus advances by reason without avoiding or seeking.

**[3] Commentary:**
Seeking it brings no joy; taking it directly incurs no anger.

**[Sub-commentary:]**
Profound awakening arises from divergence. Thus, when things seek it, there is no delight.

**[4] Commentary:**
This is the solitary arrival.

**[Sub-commentary:]**
The sagely wisdom congeals in stillness, illuminating things without attachment. It neither advances nor retreats, neither arises nor ceases—how could one who walks the empty and penetrating supreme Dao do so with a mind clinging to conditions?

**[5] Commentary:**
All that bears a name is not what I call it; each merely names itself. Thus, there is no "that" with designation and no "this" without designation.

**[Sub-commentary:]**
*Wei* (谓) means verbal teaching. The perfected person who embodies the Dao is empty, level, silent, and transcendent. Descending from the root to manifest traces, they respond and thus penetrate all. Therefore, in governing through principle, they teach without designation; in teaching, they govern through designation without designation.

*Chēngwèi* (称谓): *chǐzhèng* (尺证) *fǎn* (反). Below follows this pattern.

**[6] Commentary:**
All that is not true nature is but dust and defilement.

**[Sub-commentary:]**
Blending radiance with the dust, dwelling in defilement yet unstained—thus, though amidst the clamor of the vulgar, the mind roams beyond the dust and grime.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*Éryóu* (而游): Cui’s edition reads *érshī* (而施).

**[7] Sub-commentary:**
*Mènglàng* means "rough and careless." *Xī* is "what"; *ruò* is "like"; together, "how." The so-called non-reliance on the Dao and the like is the thorough investigation of principle and the exhaustion of nature. Quque intended to practice the wondrous Dao, while Changwu offered only careless remarks. Not knowing how the principle stands, by what standard is rightness to be judged?

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*Mèng* (孟): read as written. Xu: *wǔdǎng* (武党) or *wǔzàng* (武葬).
*Làng* (浪): read as written. Xu: *lìdàng* (力荡).
Xiang: *Mènglàng* sounds like *mànlán* (漫澜), meaning "without direction or choice."
Li: "like *jiàoluè* (较略), 'approximate.'"
Cui: "the appearance of imprecision."
◎ Qingfan’s note: *Wen Xuan*’s *Zuo Taichong’s "Wu Capital Rhapsody"* commentary cites Sima: "*Mènglàng* is rustic speech." The *Shiwen* omits this.
Also: *Mènglàng* is like *mòluò* (莫络), meaning "not detailed." (See Liu Kui’s commentary on Zuo Si’s *Wu Capital Rhapsody*.) *Mòluò* is also written as *mólüè* (摹略). *Mozi’s "Minor Selection"* reads: "*Mólüè* encompasses the thusness of the myriad things." *Mólüè* is a term of summation. *Mòluò*, *mólüè*, and *mènglàng* are all phonetic shifts of the same word.
*Zhīxíng* (之行): read as written, or *xiàmèng* (下孟).

Changwuzi said: "This is what the Yellow Emperor himself found perplexing—how could I, Qiu, presume to know it? Moreover, you are far too hasty in your calculations: seeing an egg, you demand the crowing of the rooster at dawn; seeing a slingshot, you crave the roasted owl.

**[1] Sub-commentary:**
*Tīngyíng* describes the appearance of doubt and confusion. The supreme Dao is profoundly mysterious; it cannot be fathomed through names and words. Even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, though sages, could not exhaust its wonders through discourse—they remained perplexed to the end. Who am I to claim understanding? Some versions write *huáng* (黄, "Yellow") instead of *huáng* (皇, "August"), referring to Xuanyuan.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*Huángdì* (皇帝): Some editions write *Huángdì* (黄帝).
◎ Lu Wenchang: *Huáng* (皇) and *huáng* (黄) are interchangeable. The current text reads *Huángdì* (黄帝).
*Tīng* (听): *chìdìng* (敕定).
*Yíng* (荧): sounds like *yíng* (莹, "polished jade"). Some write *yíng* (莹), *yújiǒng* (于迥).
Xiang and Sima: "*Tīngyíng* means doubt and confusion."
Li: "the appearance of dimness."
Cui: "slightly bright but not fully clear."
Xiang and Cui’s edition writes □*róng* (□荣).
◎ Lu Wenchang: *Zihui Bu* states: □ appears in Buddhist texts. *Sui Han* says: □ is the same as *huī* (辉, "radiance").

**[2] Commentary:**
Things have their natural course; principles have their ultimate limits. Following them directly leads to a silent, spontaneous accord—beyond words. Thus, speech is careless, and hearing is perplexed. Even the Yellow Emperor could not free the myriad things from doubt, leaving them perplexed to the end. Therefore, the sage entrusts matters to what lies beyond the dust and grime, merging mysteriously with what transcends sight and sound. Illuminated by Heaven, they do not oppose calculation; left to their own nature, they do not force clarity. Now, Quque, upon hearing careless words, takes them for the practice of the wondrous Dao—this is no different from seeing an egg and demanding the rooster’s crow at dawn or seeing a slingshot and craving the roasted owl. Those who cannot rest in the proper time and follow the natural order, who probe change and seek transformation, who contemplate death while alive, and who cling to "this" to debate "that"—these are all reckless calculators.

**[Sub-commentary:]**
The *xiāo* is the owl, as described in Jia Yi’s *Fu*. It is the size of a hen, resembles a turtledove, and is greenish-blue. Its meat is delicious and suitable for stews or roasts, found in the Jiangnan region. Yet an egg has the potential to become a rooster, though it cannot crow at once; a slingshot may bring down an owl, though it cannot yet be roasted. Likewise, teachings may elucidate the wondrous principle, but at the time of teaching, they are not the principle itself. Quque, having just heard words, takes them for the wondrous Dao—this is too hasty a calculation.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*Qiě nǚ* (且女): sounds like *rǔ* (汝). Same below.

"《亦大》" is pronounced *tài*; Xú and Lǐ read it as *chìzuǒ*.
The annotation is the same.
"《时夜》": Cuī states: *shíyè* means "keeper of the night," referring to the rooster.
"《见弹》" is pronounced *túdàn*.
"《鸮》" is pronounced *yújiāo*.
Sīmǎ states: a small turtledove, suitable for roasting.
The *Máo Shī Cǎomù Shū* states: it is as large as a turtledove, green in color, and its meat is very fine.
"《虽复》" is pronounced *fúyòu*.
The same applies below, and the annotation in the following chapter follows this pattern.

**[Collation Notes:]**
(1) The character *huáng* is amended according to the Shìdétáng edition.
(2) The *Zhào Jiànyì* edition omits the character *fū*.

I once spoke recklessly to you,
and you listened recklessly in turn.
Why cling to sun and moon at your side,
or grasp the cosmos in your embrace?
For their lips meet,
yet their confusion and turbidity remain,
using these to vie for honor.

The multitude toils endlessly,
while the sage appears foolish and dull,
unifying the myriad ages into a single purity.
All things are thus,
yet they entangle one another with these.

**[Annotation:]**
To speak is to be reckless, so I tentatively spoke recklessly.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
"《尝为》" is pronounced *yúwěi*.

**[Annotation:]**
If one listens earnestly to reckless words, it is again too hasty a calculation.
So why not listen recklessly as well?

**[Sub-commentary:]**
*Yú* means "I."
*Xī* means "why."
The ultimate principle is wordless; to speak is reckless.
I tentatively spoke recklessly to you—why not listen recklessly as well?
Moreover, *xī* is the sound of "why."

The sage regards life and death as day and night, drawing on the analogy of the sun and moon; embraces the myriad things as one body, holding the cosmos in his embrace.

**[Annotation:]**
*Bàng* means "to rely upon."
*Xié* means "to hold within."
The four directions of heaven and earth are called *yǔ*; past and present are called *zhòu*.
The sage who aligns with the principle forgets things and forgets self, then encompasses all existence, merging life and death into oneness. Thus, Guo’s commentary states: "regards life and death as day and night, drawing on the analogy of the sun and moon; embraces the myriad things as one body, holding the cosmos in his embrace."

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
"《旁日月》" is pronounced *bó zàng* (Xu: *fú zàng*).
Sima: "to rely upon."
Cui’s version reads *bàng*.
◎ Lu Wenchang: The official edition emends *bàng* to *páng*, which is not necessarily correct.
◎ Jia Shifu: Guo Xiang punctuates "why listen recklessly" as a complete phrase, but a careful reading suggests "why rely upon the sun and moon, hold the cosmos" forms the next clause—what method does one employ to transcend beyond heaven and earth?
Qingfan notes: *Bàng* is a loan for *fàng*. *Fàng* means "to rely upon." In the *Analects*, "acting in reliance upon profit," Zheng and Kong both gloss *fàng* as "to rely upon." In the *Mozi*, "acting in reliance upon models," *fàng* also means "to rely upon." It is also written as *fāng*. In the *Book of Songs*, "the turtledove relies upon it," meaning the magpie has a nest and the turtledove relies upon it (see Wang’s *Explications of Classical Meanings*). It is also written as *páng*. *Bàng rìyuè* means "to rely upon the sun and moon." The interpretation should follow Sima’s gloss of "to rely upon"; Cui’s version reading *bàng* is incorrect.
"《挟》" is pronounced *hù dié* (Cui: *fú*).
"《宇宙》" is pronounced *zhì jiù*.
The *Shizi* states: "The four directions of heaven and earth are called *yǔ*; past and present are called *zhòu*."
The *Shuowen* states: "What the boat and carriage cover is called *zhòu*."

**[Annotation:]**
By valuing some things, hierarchy arises, and with it confusion, obscurity, and disorder—none can rectify it, each asserting their own partial truth. Thus, the Dao of spontaneous harmony is best left unspoken, entrusted to its own natural course. *Mǐnrán* means "without waves or boundaries."

**[Sub-commentary:]**
*Mǐn* describes the appearance of no distinction.
*Zhì* means "to entrust."
*Gǔ* means "chaos."
*Hūn* means "obscurity."
*Lì* refers to servants and the like, a term of low status. Human sentiments are inverted, falsely clinging to hierarchy. If the sage wishes to dispel this delusion, the Dao of (effortless) harmony and unity is best left to chaos and obscurity, following its natural course, treating all as equal—whether servant or noble.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
"《□》" in some editions appears as *□*. Guo: *mǐn* (Xu: *wǔ zhěn*; Li: *wǔ fěn*), describing the appearance of no waves or boundaries. Sima: "harmony." Xiang: *chún*, like the meeting of two lips.
◎ Lu Wenchang: In the present commentary, *bō* appears as *bèi*, likely an error.
"《滑》" Xu: *gǔ mò*; chaos. Xiang: *gǔ*, same pronunciation. Cui: *hù bā*, meaning "wooden mouthpiece."
"《涽》" Xu: *hūn*. Xiang: *gǔ hūn*, meaning "indeterminate." Cui: *shēn*, *wǔ zhōng*, meaning "rope."
◎ Lu Wenchang: Originally *hūn*. The Song edition uses the *shì* radical, and the gloss *hūn hūn* also uses *shì*; this edition follows that form.

The pursuit of right and wrong is a realm of reckless galloping. **[5]** **[Annotation:]**
The appearance of *tun*-like ignorance, moving straight forward without hesitation. **[6]** **[Annotation:]**
**[Subcommentary:]**
*Yiyì* describes the restless, driven demeanor. *Yútún* depicts the look of ignorance. Ordinary people chase after external objects, toiling endlessly without rest; those who embody the Dao abandon knowledge and perception, moving forward in *tun*-like ignorance.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*《芚》* Xu: *tú bēn* (rhymes); Guo: *zhì běn*; Sima: "chaotic, undifferentiated." Cui: "thick and rich in texture" or "bound." Li: *chǒu lún*.

**[7]** **[Annotation:]**
*Purity* means unadulterated. To survey ten thousand years and compare their changes—ordinary people call this *mixed*, hence they toil restlessly, straining body and mind, moving from this to that. Only the great sage, free from attachment, advances in *tun*-like simplicity, merging with transformation as one. In this unity with change, they constantly wander in solitude. Thus, though intermingling across countless ages, with a thousand differences and ten thousand variations, when the Dao acts, it brings completion—past and present become one completion. When things are named as such, the ten thousand things become one "as such." Nothing is not "as such," no time is not complete—this may be called *purity*.

**[Subcommentary:]**
The sage harmonizes their virtue with the two primal forces and unites their body with the ten thousand things, thus adapting to change and aligning with the world. Though passing through ancient and modern times, experiencing both peace and peril, intermingling with the dust of the world, with a thousand differences and ten thousand variations, they remain serene and unperturbed, unmoved by trifles, embracing singular purity and abiding in the wondrous ultimate.

◎ Jia Shifu:
Ordinary people are restless, comparing today with tomorrow. What they see as right today, they may see as wrong tomorrow; what they see as wrong today, they may see as right tomorrow. The sage, in *tun*-like ignorance, does not employ such distinctions but lodges them in the ordinary. They survey ten thousand years to exhaust their capacity. *One* means undifferentiated, without separation of self and other; *completion* means joyful, without distinction between "as such" and "not as such"; *purity* means tranquil, without debate over right and wrong. The sage responds to the changes of the ten thousand things with this approach, mutually enfolding them in boundlessness—this is what it means to survey ten thousand years and achieve singular completion and purity.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*《怵心》* *chù lǜ*; *《参糅》* *rú jiù*.

**[8]** **[Annotation:]**
Nothing is not "as such."

**[9]** **[Annotation:]**
*Enfolding* means accumulation. Accumulating "as such" over ten thousand years makes ten thousand years one "as such"; accumulating "as such" over the ten thousand things makes the ten thousand things entirely "as such." Thus, one does not know where life and death, before and after, self and other, victory and defeat reside.

**[Subcommentary:]**
The sentiments of things have been entrenched for a long time. Thus, when discussing the ten thousand things horizontally, none do not claim "I am right, others are wrong"; when recounting past and present vertically, all insist "I am right, others are wrong." Though the ten thousand things are many and past and present are distant, the accumulation of right and wrong never ceases. The sage follows the world’s rise and fall, moving yet always still, intermingling countless ages in pure, unchanging unity.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*《相蕴》* Also written as *缊*. Xu: *yú fèn*; Guo: *yú běn*; Li: *yú wèn*. Meaning "accumulation."

How do I know that delighting in life is not a delusion? **[1]**
How do I know that hating death is not like a youth lost and unable to find their way home? **[2]**
Lady Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first took her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. Yet once she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. **[3]**
How do I know that the dead do not regret their initial longing for life? **[4]**

**[1]** **[Annotation:]**
Life and death are one, yet one delights only in life, desiring to oppose transformation—how is this not delusion?

The forge shapes the ten thousand things without partiality; transformation and death are of a single principle. Yet to delight only in life and hate death—how is this not delusion?

Losing one’s former home in youth is called *weak loss*. Those who suffer *weak loss* become content with their new place and do not know to return to their homeland. How do I know that life is not *weak loss*? How do I know that death is not a return, yet one hates it?

**[Subcommentary:]**
*Weak* refers to youth; *loss* means to lose. It describes those who, in their youth, encounter chaos, lose their homeland, settle in foreign lands, and do not know to return—this is called *weak loss*. Emerging from nothing into being is called *life*; returning from being to nothing is called *death*. To cling to life and hate death—is this not *weak loss*, not knowing the way home?

Within a single lifetime, emotions change like this.

At such a time, one does not know the other—how much less can one know the transformations of life and death! **[Subcommentary:]**
Formerly, Duke Mu of Qin and Duke Xian of Jin jointly attacked the state of Li Rong and obtained a beautiful woman and two jade rings. Qin took the rings while Jin took the woman—she was the daughter of the border guard of Ai in the state of Li Rong. *Kuang* means "correct." When she first left Li Rong, parting from her kin and homeland, her longing for her native soil moved her to tears that soaked her lapels. Later, upon arriving in the state of Jin, she was favored with great honor, sharing the same royal couch with Duke Xian in feasting and repose, and offered sumptuous viands to fill the kitchens. As her affections shifted, she came to regret her earlier weeping. Within a single lifetime, emotions change like this—how much less can one know the difference between life and death! Zhuangzi spoke in parables, hence he referred to Duke Xian as "the king." **[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*《至于王所》* Cui [Yun] says: During the Warring States period, the feudal lords presumptuously styled themselves as kings, thus Duke Xian is here called "the king." *《筐》* In some versions, written as *kuang*. Xu [Shen]: *qi kuang* rhyme.

"《床》" Xu pronounces as *chuang*. Sima [Biao] says: *kuang chuang* means a restful couch. Cui [Yun] says: *kuang* means square. Another opinion: it means a proper couch.

**[Note 4]** **[Annotation]** *Qi* means to seek.
**[Exegesis]** *Qi* means to seek. When Lady Li arrived in Jin, she regretted her earlier weeping—how could the dead not likewise regret their initial desire to live while alive!

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*《蕲》* Pronounced *qi*, meaning to seek.

**[Textual Note:]**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition omits the two characters *suo wei* below.
(2) The Zhao edition lacks the character *zhi*.

One who dreams of drinking wine wakes to weep; one who dreams of weeping wakes to hunt. While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even interpret the dream—only upon waking does one realize it was a dream. Yet there is a great awakening, after which one knows this was the great dream. The foolish, however, believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their knowledge: "You are a lord!" "You are a herdsman!" How rigid! Confucius and you—we are all dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called *diaogui* (perverse consolation). Even ten thousand generations later, should a great sage arise who understands this, it would be as if encountering them at dawn or dusk.

**[Note 1]** **[Annotation]** This refers to the mutability of waking and dreaming. If circumstances change, emotions differ, then the desires of life and death cannot be the same. Thus, one who delights in life while alive will delight in death when dead. Though life and death differ, each attains its wish equally—what attachment remains?

**[Exegesis]** The change between life and death is like the difference between waking and dreaming. Since waking and dreaming are distinct, so too are the feelings of life and death. Yet if one wakes to misfortune but dreams of joy, why should death not bring delight and life sorrow? Thus, the distinction between waking and dreaming cannot be clung to.

**[Phonetic Gloss:]**
*《乐生》* Pronounced *le*, as below.

**[2] [Annotation]**
From this perspective, at the moment of death, one does not recognize it as death but instead finds contentment in fulfilling their will.

**[Exegesis]**
When one is about to dream, they do not know it is a dream—just as, when one is about to enter death, they do not know it is death. Each fulfills their will; what is there to cling to?

**[3] [Annotation]**
As for the dreamer who, within a dream, interprets that very dream, this differs not at all from the waking state.

**[4] [Annotation]**
In whatever one encounters, there is nothing lacking—why then, while alive, should one fear death?

**[Exegesis]**
When a person is in the midst of sleep and dreams, they take it as reality, even interpreting the dream’s omens and pondering its fortune or misfortune. Only upon waking do they realize it was a dream. Thus, one delights in life while alive and delights in death when dead—why, then, should one fear death while living?

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*《觉而》* Pronounced *jiào*. The same applies below and in the annotations.

**[5] [Annotation]**
The great awakened one is the sage. The great awakened one knows that all who harbor anxieties and concerns remain unawakened.

**[Exegesis]**
The bustling masses, the teeming multitudes—all gallop through the realm of striving and action, lost in the great dream. Only the sage who embodies the Dao is luminously and uniquely awake, knowing that all who harbor anxieties and concerns remain unawakened.

**[6] [Annotation]**
The foolish, lost in the great dream, believe themselves awake. Thus, they furtively exalt what they favor as rulers and degrade what they despise as herdsmen, joyfully clinging to the prejudices of their own household. This is truly narrow-minded.

**[Exegesis]**
The deluded masses, benighted as if wandering in darkness, slumber in dreams yet believe themselves awake. Furtively, they debate based on their limited knowledge, elevating what they favor as rulers and equating what they despise with herdsmen. To hold such sentiments is truly narrow-minded. Cattle are tended by *herdsmen (牧)*, horses by *grooms (圉)*.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*《窃窃》* Sima: "Like *察察* (keen scrutiny)."
*《牧乎》* Cui’s edition reads *跂乎*, glossed as *踶跂* (the appearance of a stubborn sheep).

*《所恶》* Pronounced *wūlù*.

**[7] [Annotation]**
Those who cannot forget words and attain spiritual comprehension are not truly great awakened ones.

**[Exegesis]**
Qiu is the name of Changwu. Even those who perceive the true source are still called dreamers—how much less can the furtive fools be considered awake?

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*《神解》* Pronounced *xiè*; Xu reads *hùxiè*.

**[8] [Annotation]**
This is like interpreting dreams within a dream. To believe oneself dreaming is still not awakening—how much less can those who furtively believe themselves awake be considered so?

**[Exegesis]**
The deluded, lacking awakening, discuss dreams while still in dreams; their spoken words, though subtle, remain within the realm of language. Thus, interpreting dreams within a dream renders all dreams empty; testing words within words reveals their hollowness. This analogy of interpreting dreams within a dream is but a reckless discourse.

**[9] [Annotation]**
Extraordinary discourse is beyond the ken of ordinary people, hence it is called *吊当卓诡* (eccentric and uncanny), and they do not recognize its profound liberation.

**[Exegesis]**
When the whole world is dreaming, such is profound discourse. Extraordinary words disregard the vulgar; *吊当卓诡* (eccentric and uncanny) shocks and astonishes the common mind. Without clarity and penetration, how could one grasp its depth?

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*《吊》* Read as written, or pronounced *dì* (to reach).
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The character *又* was missing in the old edition; now restored.
*《诡》* Pronounced *jiǔwěi* (strange, uncanny).

**[10] [Annotation]**
Those who can shed all attachments and harmonize life and death as one are exceedingly rare.

**[Exegesis]**
Across ten thousand years, a great sage appears but once, one who knows the three realms are all empty, the four births are not real, and all distinctions of self and other, speech and debate, exist within dreams. Such a liberated person is a rare encounter—so distant and fleeting, it is as if met at dawn or dusk. Thirty years make an age.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*《其解》* Pronounced *xiè*; Xu reads *hùxiè*.
*《蜕然》* Pronounced *shuì*, or *shǐruì*.

Even if you and I were to debate, and you were to prevail over me, or I over you—would it truly mean that you are right and I am wrong? Or if I were to prevail over you, and you not prevail over me, would it truly mean that I am right and you are wrong? Must one of us be right and the other wrong? Or could both be right, or both be wrong? You and I cannot know for certain, and others are likewise shrouded in obscurity. Whom, then, could we appoint to decide? If we chose someone who agrees with you, how could they decide fairly, already sharing your view? If we chose someone who agrees with me, how could they decide fairly, already sharing my view? If we chose someone who disagrees with both of us, how could they decide fairly, already differing from us both? And if we chose someone who agrees with both of us, how could they decide fairly, already sharing our view? Thus, neither you nor I nor anyone else can truly know, so why wait for another?

What does it mean to harmonize with the natural balance of the Dao? It is to say: "Is" is not necessarily "is," and "is not" is not necessarily "is not." If "is" were truly "is," then its difference from "is not" would require no debate. If "so" were truly "so," then its difference from "not so" would require no debate. The mutual dependence of claims is like their independence. Harmonizing with the natural balance of the Dao, following the ceaseless flow of transformation, is how one spends a lifetime. Forgetting time, forgetting distinctions, one soars into the boundless, and thus dwells in the boundless.

The *Shiwen* glosses:
《和之》read as written; Cui and Hu read it as *wo* (卧).
《天倪》Li reads as *yai* (崖), Xu as *yi* (诣), Guo with the homophone *wudi* (五底).
Li says: "division."
Cui says: "Sometimes written as 霓, same sound, meaning 'boundary.'"
Ban Gu says: "Heaven’s discernment."
◎Lu Wenchang notes: The old edition mistakenly wrote *yai* (崖) as *Cui*; corrected here according to the *Da Zongshi* chapter. *Ni* (倪) sounds close to *yan* (研), hence *ji ni* (计倪) is also written as *ji yan* (计研).

【二】
**Commentary:** Right and wrong, affirmation and negation—these are mutually opposed between self and other, hence there is no debate. Since there is no debate, one harmonizes with the *tianni* (Heaven’s boundary), resting in the natural divisions alone, without relying on the other to correct them.

**Exegesis:** *Bian* (辩) means "to distinguish." Right and wrong, affirmation and negation arise from deluded emotions; when examined by principle, they are entirely illusory. What is deemed "right" is not right, and what is deemed "so" is not so. How do we know this? If "right" were truly right, it would differ from "wrong"; if "so" were truly so, it would differ from "not so." Yet what this one calls "right," that one calls "wrong"; what that one affirms, this one denies. Thus, right and wrong, affirmation and negation—principle does not distinguish between them. Self and other oppose each other, vainly making distinctions, hence there is no debate.

【三】
**Commentary:** The debate over right and wrong is but the clamor of transformation. The mutual dependence of such clamor is insufficient to correct one another, hence they are as if not mutually dependent.

**Exegesis:** Right and wrong, self and other, are formed through mutual dependence; when examined by principle, this dependence is also unreal. Thus, the clamor of transformation gives rise to these names of dependence. Since names are not true, dependence is but empty dependence. If dependence is not dependence, then we know they are not mutually dependent.
◎Jia Shifu says: To change with things is called the clamor of transformation. "Is" and "is not," "so" and "not so"—these lie in people. Whether one waits for others to affirm "is" and "so," or whether one is self-affirming and self-so without relying on others, all are irrelevant to the heart. This is what it means to harmonize with the *tianni* (Heaven’s boundary).

【四】
**Commentary:** Harmonizing with the natural divisions and following the boundless transformations, one proceeds thus endlessly—then the realm of right and wrong naturally dissolves, and the ultimate of life and destiny is fully realized.

**Exegesis:** *Mandyan* (曼衍) means "transformation." *Yin* (因) means "to follow." *Qiong* (穷) means "to exhaust." Harmonizing with the natural divisions, there is neither right nor wrong; following the boundless transformations, one is neither attached nor obstructed. Thus, dwelling in compliance and ease, one exhausts the life and destiny of Heaven’s years.
**Shiwen:** 《曼》Xu reads as *wan* (万), Guo as *wuban* (武半).
《衍》Xu reads as *yizhan* (以战).

Sima [Biao] says: *Mandyan* (曼衍) means "boundless."

**Commentary:** One who forgets years thereby unites life and death in profound sameness; one who forgets righteousness thereby transcends right and wrong. When right and wrong, life and death are dissolved into oneness, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows unbounded through the infinite—thus, those who lodge in it cannot be exhausted.

**Exegesis:** *Zhen* (振) means "to flow freely." *Jing* (竟) means "to exhaust." *Yu* (寓) means "to lodge." Years are what life is endowed with; having equated life and death, one forgets years. Righteousness is what adjudicates right and wrong; having unified right and wrong, one forgets righteousness. This is the meaning of relinquishing prior knowledge of the inexhaustibility of right and wrong. Then, when life and death, right and wrong are dissolved into oneness, the wondrous principle becomes thoroughly permeating, illuminating the boundless. To lodge in the boundless is also to have no boundlessness that can be permeated—this is yet another relinquishing of the infinite.

**Shiwen:**
《振》Read as written. Cui [Yuan] says: "to halt." Also pronounced *zhirěn* (之忍反).
《无竟》Read as written, meaning "limit." Cui writes it as *jing* (境).
**Collation:** (1) The *Quewu* cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript: after "是也" there is no "辩作其无辩矣"; after "然" there is no "亦无辩作亦无辩矣."

The *wangliang* asked the shadow: "Earlier you were walking, now you have stopped; earlier you were sitting, now you have risen..."

"Why is it that you have no steadfast resolve?"

**Annotations:**
(1) *Wangliang*: the faint yin shadow beyond the physical shadow.

**Commentary:**
*Wangliang* refers to the faint yin shadow beyond the physical shadow. *Nang* means "earlier"; *te* (特) means "alone" or "independent." Zhuangzi employs allegory to expound profound principles, thus using the shadow and *wangliang* to illustrate the meaning of spontaneous transformation. The *wangliang* asks the shadow: "Earlier you were walking, now you have stopped; earlier you were sitting, now you have risen. Yet your walking and stopping, sitting and rising are all determined by your form—you merely follow others without any independent will or resolve. Why is this?"

**Shiwen:**
《罔兩》 Guo [Xiang] says: the faint yin shadow beyond the physical shadow. Xiang [Xiu] says: the shadow of the shadow. Cui [Yuan] writes it as *wanglang*, meaning "the state of being and non-being." ◎ Qingfan’s note: *Wangliang* is written as *wanglang* by Sima [Biao]. The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Ban Mengjian’s *You Tong Fu* cites Sima: "*Wanglang* is the layered yin beyond the shadow." The *Shiwen* cites Cui’s version as *wanglang*, describing it as "the state of being and non-being," differing in meaning from Sima’s gloss. 《景》 Pronounced *yǐng* (永反), or as written. Some versions write it as *影* (shadow), which is colloquial. 《曩》 Xu [Shen] reads it as *nǎng* (乃荡反). Li [Yi] says: "earlier." 《無特》 Some versions write it as *持*. Cui says: "*Te* is a particle." Xiang says: "lacking steadfastness means inconstancy in movement and stillness." 《操與》 Pronounced *yú* (余).

The shadow replied: "Do I depend on something to be thus? Does that on which I depend also depend on something else to be thus? Do I rely on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How could I know why it is so! How could I know why it is not so!"

The shadow continued:

**[4]**
**[1]** *Annotation:* This speaks of the heavenly mechanism moving of itself, whether sitting or rising, without reliance. That which attains uniqueness without dependence—who could know its cause and demand its reason?

*Exegesis:* The forms and substances of all things are endowed by nature. Though affairs seem to have causes, their principle lies in non-dependence. Yet form and shadow are not distant, and still possess this heavenly mechanism. Thus it is said: the myriad kinds, though diverse, are all self-transforming.

**[2]** *Annotation:* If one demands what it depends on and traces its origin, then the pursuit of dependence will be endless, ultimately reaching non-dependence, and the principle of self-transformation will become clear.

*Exegesis:* What the shadow depends on is precisely the form. If the shadow depends on the form, and the form depends on the Creator, then what does the Creator depend on? This would lead to an infinite regress of dependence, ultimately arriving at non-dependence.

**[3]** *Annotation:* If it depended on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada, then the reason for its lack of steadfastness would not be difficult to discern. The present unknowability arises precisely from its non-dependence on such things and its self-transformation.

*Exegesis:* Former lecturers and Master Guo focused their attention, all saying that *shefu* refers to the rough scales beneath a snake’s belly, and *tiaoyi* to the wings of a cicada. They claimed that a snake depends on its scales to move, a cicada on its wings to fly, and a shadow on its form to exist—yet this is not so. If flight depended on wings and running on legs, then the kinds of flying birds and running beasts would be endless. Why single out the scales of a snake and cite them as an analogy? The present interpretation holds that *fu* refers to a snake’s shed skin, and *tiaoyi* to a cicada’s molted shell. A snake sheds its old skin, a cicada emerges with a new shell—neither knows why, nor can they explain how it is so. They are self-generated, without dependence. Yet these two creatures, snake and cicada, shed their skins and shells, differing from other beings, and thus are cited as examples. As the *Outer Chapters* state: "Do I rely on the shed skin of a snake or the shell of a cicada?" From this, we know that the principle of form and shadow is no different from that of shed skin and shell.

*Phonetic Gloss:*
*《蛇蚹》* Pronounced *fù* (附), Xu [Shen] also reads it as *fū* (敷). Sima [Biao] says: "It refers to the rough scales beneath a snake’s belly that enable movement."
*龃* Pronounced *jǔ* (士女反), *龉* pronounced *yǔ* (鱼女反).
*《蜩》* Xu [Shen] reads it as *tiáo* (条).

**[4]** *Annotation:* Some in the world say that *wangliang* depends on the shadow, the shadow on the form, and the form on the Creator. Let us ask: Does the Creator exist or not? If it does not exist, how can it create things? If it does exist, it is insufficient to account for the multitude of forms. Only by clarifying that the multitude of forms are self-created can one begin to speak of a Creator. Thus, entering the realm of existing things, even *wangliang* does not fail to self-transform in the profound and obscure. Therefore, the Creator has no master, and each thing creates itself. Each thing creates itself without dependence—this is the norm of Heaven and Earth. Thus, self and other are mutually entailed, form and shadow arise together. Though profoundly united, they do not depend on one another. Clarifying this principle will lead the myriad things to return each to its root within itself, without dependence on the external. The external will have nothing to reject, and the internal nothing to pride itself on. Thus, all things arise harmoniously without knowing why they arise, and all attain their nature without knowing how they attain it. Now, *wangliang*’s relation to the shadow is like saying they arise together without dependence. Thus, though the myriad things gather and together complete Heaven, each is distinctly self-evident. Therefore, *wangliang* is not controlled by the shadow, nor is the shadow manipulated by the form, nor is the form transformed by nothingness. Then transformation and non-transformation, being so and not being so, following others or being self-determined—all are self-so. How could I know their reason! Thus, to act without aiding is to allow root and branch, internal and external, to flow unimpeded and attain their nature, leaving no trace. If, however, one demands this proximate cause and forgets its self-so nature, clings to things externally, and loses the master within, then attachment and esteem arise. Though one may seek to equalize them, what is esteemed already resides in the heart—how can equality be achieved?

*Exegesis:* Whether dependence or non-dependence, being so or not being so, the heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, without a governing master. How could one apply the mind to pursue and reflect upon it with cognitive understanding!

*Phonetic Gloss:*
*《丧》* Pronounced *sàng* (息浪反).

*Textual Note:*
(1) The character *卒* is amended following the Song edition and the *Shide Tang* edition.
(2) The *Shide Tang* edition reads *化* (transformation) instead of *物* (things).

Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly—fluttering and joyous, a butterfly indeed, delighting in its own contentment! He did not know he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, solidly and unmistakably Zhou. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things.

*Annotation:*
Self-satisfied and carefree, moving in blissful ease.

*Exegesis:*
"Fluttering and joyous" describes a state of exuberant delight. "Delighting" means to comprehend. The alternation of life and death, the succession of cold and heat—these are the constant patterns of Heaven and Earth, the principles of the myriad things. Yet Zhuangzi, with luminous clarity like a mirror, illumined all; with boundless goodness, he roamed freely. Thus he could entrust the dream and waking to the cycle of life and death, and lodge his self in the transformation of things. For this reason, in his dream he became a butterfly, fluttering and joyous, at ease in his heart; upon waking, he was Zhuang Zhou, serene and fulfilled in his purpose.

*Phonetic Gloss:*
*《胡蝶》* Xu: *tú xié* (反); Sima, Cui: "butterfly."
*《栩》* Xu: *kuàng yǔ* (反), "joyous appearance"; Cui: writes *翩*.
*《自喻》* Li: "delighting, finding joy."
*《志与》* Pronounced *yú*; below same. Cui: "final particle, *zāi*."

[2] **Commentary:** When he dreamed of being a butterfly and forgot Zhou, it was no different from being utterly dead. Yet wherever he was, he found his will perfectly at ease. Thus, those who cling to life while alive will surely cling to death when dying. From this we see that those who grieve over death while alive are mistaken.

**Exegesis:** When he became a butterfly, he was vividly aware, his heart delighted and his emotions satisfied—so joyous that he knew only the butterfly and not Zhuang Zhou. Death’s unawareness of life is the same in principle.

[3] **Commentary:** From Zhou’s perspective, he called it waking, but it was not necessarily not a dream.

**Exegesis:** *Qúqú* describes a startled, agitated appearance. In an instant, the dream ended and he awoke, astonished and reflective, now Zhuang Zhou. Thus the commentary says: from Zhou’s perspective, he called it waking, but it was not necessarily not a dream.

*Phonetic Gloss:*
*《然觉》* Gǔ: *xiào* (反).
*《蘧蘧》* Xú: *qú*; also *qí lǜ* (反). Li: "having form and appearance." Cui: writes *jùjù*, citing *The Great and Venerable Master*: *jùrán jué*.

[4] **Commentary:** Today’s unawareness of the butterfly is no different from the dream’s unawareness of Zhou. Each suits its momentary will, so there is no way to prove that the butterfly does not dream of being Zhou. If there are those who doze and dream of a hundred years passing, there is no way to prove that this present hundred years is not a doze’s dream.

**Exegesis:** Once he dreamed of being a butterfly, his emotions flowed freely; now as Zhuang Zhou, he also finds his will at ease. Thus, waking and dreaming cannot be definitively distinguished, and how can one discern the reality or illusion of Zhou and the butterfly?

[5] **Commentary:** The distinction between waking and dreaming is no different from the debate over life and death. The reason one finds joy in self-satisfaction lies in the fixed nature of these states, not in their absence.

**Exegesis:** Whether awake or dreaming, whether butterfly or Zhou, to call it insubstantial is also to acknowledge its boundaries.

[6] **Commentary:** Time does not pause even briefly, and the present does not endure. Thus yesterday’s dream has already transformed by today. The change of life and death is no different—why trouble the heart over it? To be absorbed in one is to be unaware of the other, as when he dreamed of being a butterfly. From a human perspective, in a single lifetime, the present does not know the future, as with Lady Li. Yet fools whisper to themselves, believing they know that life is joyful and death is bitter, unaware of the transformation of things.

**Exegesis:** Ever-renewing change, the ceaseless flow of things—like the swift passage of a finger or the crossing of arms, Zhou and the butterfly, waking and dreaming, occur in an instant. The later does not know the earlier, this does not know that. Why then, while alive, fret over death and vainly stir up sorrow? Thus we know that the coming and going of life and death are the transformations of the principle of things.

**Book Two, Chapter Three: "The Preservation of Life" (Internal Chapters)**

[1] **Commentary:** Life exists to be nurtured, so nurturing life is the ultimate principle. Yet if nurturing exceeds its proper limit and harms life, it is no longer the true preservation of life.

*Phonetic Gloss:*
Preserving life takes this as its guiding principle.

"My life has limits,
while knowledge has none.
To follow the limitless with the limited is perilous;
and to do so while claiming knowledge is perilous indeed.
In doing good, avoid proximity to fame;
in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment.
Follow the *du* as your constant,
and you may preserve your body,
perfect your life,
nurture your kin,
and fulfill your years."

[1] **Commentary:** The endowment each receives has its own limit.

**Exegesis:** *Yá* means "limit." Life is the vessel of form, bestowed by nature. Foolishness or wisdom, long or short life—each has its allotted limit. To know when to stop and abide within one’s limit, not straying beyond, is the subtlety of preserving life. Yet the common people all speak of "I," so all who speak of "I" have limits.

*Phonetic Gloss:*
*《有涯》* Also written *崖*, *yú jiā* (反).

[2] **Commentary:** One who lifts the heavy and carries the light with ease—this is the limit of one’s strength. Yet those who crave fame and competition, though they may have extraordinary strength, still cannot satisfy their desires. This is the limitlessness of knowledge. Thus, the pursuit of knowledge arises from imbalance and vanishes in profound equilibrium. Profound equilibrium means following one’s utmost capacity without the slightest excess. Therefore, though bearing ten thousand *jun*, if it accords with one’s ability, one suddenly forgets the weight upon one’s body. Though responding to ten thousand affairs, one is oblivious to their presence. This is the true preservation of life.

**Exegesis:** Each form and nature has its own limit, yet discriminating knowledge pursues things without end. This exhausts the heart and wearies the body, leaving desires unfulfilled. Failing to stop within one’s limit is not the true preservation of life.

*Phonetic Gloss:*
*《而知》* *zhì*. Same below in commentary.

《好勝》*hào shèng*, "love of victory." Below: *shēng zhèng*.
《雖復》*suī fù*. Below: same.
《絕膂》*jué lǚ*.
《以慊》*yǐ qiè*, "to be satisfied."

◎Lu Wenchong notes: In antiquity, this character shared the same sound with *qiè* in *qiè hèn* ("resentment"), and was not pronounced as *qiè* in the sense of "sufficiency" as its primary gloss.

**[3]**
**Exegesis:** To pursue limitless knowledge with a finite nature—how could one not become exhausted?

**Commentary:** Life is finite, while knowledge is boundless. Thus, to employ finite life in the pursuit of boundless knowledge is to weary the body and exhaust the spirit, leading to peril.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
《殆已》Xiang [Yun] says: "to be fatigued and distressed."

**[4]**
**Exegesis:** Already wearied by knowledge yet failing to cease, one then employs knowledge to remedy it—this is to nourish yet harm, truly the greatest peril.

**Commentary:** Boundless knowledge has already been put to use; deliberate learning then attempts to salvage it afterward. How could one avoid peril?

◎Jia Shifu says: To strive ceaselessly for knowledge, pushing to its limitless extreme, is to end in exhaustion. Yet this restless knowledge, lodged in the heart, burdens one’s nature and harms the spirit. To merge obscurely with things, to congeal the spirit in stillness, so that knowledge does not arise in the heart—this is to perfect one’s nature and preserve it, to extinguish knowledge and safeguard life. Thus it is said: "To persist in knowledge after exhaustion is perilous indeed."

**[5]**
**Exegesis:** Forgetting good and evil, abiding in the center, and allowing the myriad things to act of themselves—obscurely one becomes one with the utmost appropriateness. Thus, penal codes and names are distant, while the whole principle resides within.

**Commentary:** The deliberate learning of the vulgar world has many followers, but in essence, nothing precedes good and evil. To do good is always close to fame and praise; to do evil is always near to punishment and execution. Thus, vulgar knowledge and learning are insufficient to remedy prior knowledge; instead, they exhaust the heart and spirit, increasing peril.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
《無近》"not close to." Below: same.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Wen Xuan* annotation to Ji Shuye’s *Poem of Hidden Grief* cites Sima [Xiangru], saying: "Do not cultivate fame." Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, one defiles the body to render its form without disgrace. *Shiwen* is lacking.

◎ Jia Shifu remarks: Wang Fuzhi states that what cannot be named as good among the likes of sound and color is itself evil.

《闷然》*men* (obscure), rhyming with *ben*; also pronounced *men* (gate).
《远己》*yuan* (distant), rhyming with *wan*.

**[6]**
**Exegesis:** To follow the center as one’s constant.

**Commentary:** *Yuan* means to follow; *du* means the center; *jing* means the constant. When good and evil are both forgotten and penal codes and names both relinquished, one may follow the Way of the singular center, abide in the true constancy of virtue, remain empty and at ease while letting things take their course, and move with the world’s transformations. The subtlety of nurturing life lies precisely here.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
《缘督以为经》Li [Yi] says: *Yuan* means to follow; *du* means the center; *jing* means the constant. Guo [Xiang] and Cui [Zhuan] concur.
◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Wen Xuan* annotation to Zuo Taichong’s *Rhapsody on the Wei Capital* cites Sima [Xiangru], saying: *Yuan* means to follow; *du* means the center. To follow and guard the center of the Way as one’s constant.
*Shiwen* is lacking.
◎ Li Zhen remarks: The *Suwen*’s *Treatise on Bone Hollows* states: "The *du* vessel arises below the central bone of the lower abdomen." The *Lingshu*’s *Root and Branch* chapter says: "The seventh vessel, the one at the center of the neck, is the *du* vessel." As the spine alone occupies the center of the body, the *du* vessel ascends alongside it, hence the gloss of *du* as one of the extraordinary vessels. *Zhuangzi* here borrows the vessel as a metaphor, as seen in the subsequent discussion of preserving the body and fulfilling life.
◎ Jia Shifu remarks: Wang Fuzhi states that among the eight extraordinary vessels, the *ren* and *du* govern the breath of respiration. The central vessel at the front of the body is called *ren*; the central vessel at the back is called *du*. *Du* signifies abiding in stillness without leaning to either side, possessing the position of a vessel yet lacking material form. To "follow the *du*" is to circulate the subtle and refined *qi* along the void, halting where it cannot proceed, so that its movement naturally follows and attains the center.

**[7]**
**Exegesis:** To nurture one’s kin with fittingness.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
《以养》*yang* (nurture), rhyming with *shang*. Annotation identical.

**[8]**
**Exegesis:** If one attains the center and moves in obscurity, then nothing is impermissible. Nurturing life does not seek excess but merely fulfills principle and exhausts one’s years.

**Commentary:** Only one who abides in the singular center by relinquishing the two extremes can preserve the body and fulfill the Way of life. Externally, this enables one to serve and nurture parents, perfectly aligning with human relations; internally, it allows one to safeguard the spirit and exhaust one’s Heaven-appointed mandate.

**Collation:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *qi* (its) in place of *er* (and).
(2) The character *mai* (vessel) follows the original text of the *Suwen*.

Butcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot trod, where his knee pressed—each movement produced a crisp *xu* sound, and every stroke of his blade resounded with a *huo*. All fell into perfect rhythm, harmonizing with the dance of *Sanglin* and matching the cadence of *Jingshou*.

**Exegesis:** "Butcher Ding" refers to the kitchen servant named Ding, equivalent to today’s royal chef. Alternatively, "Ding" may be his given name. "Lord Wenhui" is King Hui of Liang. "Carving" means butchering. "Pressing with the knee" refers to using the lower angle of the joint to brace. The passage describes Butcher Ding’s skill in butchering: observing the natural grain of the ox, he would strike with his hand, lean with his shoulder, tread with his foot, and brace with his knee, causing flesh and hide to part with a *xu* sound in response. As he wielded his blade, the ox would split with a great *huo*. This is an allegory for the art of nurturing life through Butcher Ding.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*《庖丁》* Cui’s edition writes *pao* (胞), same pronunciation. *Bai jiao* rhyme. "Butcher" is the occupation; Ding is his name. *Guanzi* mentions *Tun the Butcher*, who could carve nine oxen in a morning, his blade sharp enough to shave hair. ◎Lu Wenchang notes: *Liji*’s *Jitong* writes *hui pao* (辉胞), synonymous with *pao* (庖).
*《为》* *Yu wei* rhyme.
*《文惠君》* Cui and Sima state: King Hui of Liang.

【Note 2】
The annotation states: speaking of how he follows convenience to apply skill, leaving nothing unmastered in his dissection, fully attaining the principle to the utmost. Having accorded with the ox’s natural grain, he also harmonizes with musical rhythm.

【Exegesis】
*Sanglin* is the name of King Tang of Shang’s music. *Jingshou* is the name of a movement in the *Xianchi* music, which is the music of Yao. Butcher Ding’s spirit and demeanor were unhurried, perfectly mastering the ox’s natural structure. Moreover, the sounds of his carving blade were refined, elegantly matching the tones of the scale. Thus, his music resonated with *Sanglin*, and his rhythm aligned with *Jingshou*.

Butcher Ding laid down his knife and replied: "What your servant delights in is the Dao, which advances beyond mere skill.

When I first began to butcher oxen, what I saw was nothing but whole oxen. After three years, I no longer saw whole oxen. Now, I encounter them with spirit rather than gaze with the eyes; the senses halt, yet the spirit moves. Following the natural grain, I strike at the great gaps, guide the blade into the great cavities, and proceed according to what is inherently so. I have never touched the knots of sinew and bone, much less the great thigh bones!

A good butcher replaces his knife once a year—he cuts. A mediocre butcher replaces his knife every month—he hacks. My knife has now been in use for nineteen years, having butchered several thousand oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. For the joints have spaces, and the blade’s edge has no thickness. Applying what has no thickness to what has space, there is surely ample room for the blade to move. That is why after nineteen years, the edge is as if newly whetted.

Nevertheless, whenever I come to a complex joint, I see the difficulty, become alert, focus my gaze, slow my movement. The blade moves ever so slightly, and *hua!*—the ox falls apart like clods of earth crumbling to the ground. I stand holding the knife, look around in satisfaction, then wipe it clean and put it away."

"The *Da Kuan* (Great Cavity): Xu reads it as *ku guan*; another reading is *ku he*. Cui, Guo, and Sima all say: 'empty.' Xiang reads it as *kong*. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern texts write *Dao* (導) as *dao* (道). *Kuan* (窾) and *ke* (科) are interchangeable, hence they share the same pronunciation. ◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Shuowen* lacks the character *kuan*; it should be *kuan* (款). In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, "Taishigong Zixu," what does not strike the body is called *kuan*; in the *Book of Han*, "Biography of Sima Qian," *kuan* is written as *kuan* (款). Fu Qian’s annotation: *kuan* means 'empty.' The *Erya*, "Shi Qi," states: 'A tripod with hollow legs is called a *li*,' with the annotation: *kuan* means 'empty.' The *Huainanzi*, "Shuo Shan," says: 'Seeing a hollowed tree float, one knows it can be a boat,' with Gao’s annotation: *kuan* means 'empty.' The *Guanzi*, "Guo Xu," states: 'The great inner *kuan*,' with Yang’s annotation: 'inner *kuan* means inner emptiness.' This serves as evidence.

*The Jie Jie* (Joint Resolution): Read as *hu mai*. 【9】【Annotation】The blade is not applied recklessly. 【Exegesis】Following the spaces and hollows, the knife is then wielded—just as one relies on what is seen and heard, never applying discriminating judgment recklessly. 【10】【Annotation】The marvel of skill lies in constantly moving the blade through emptiness, never encountering even the slightest obstruction. 【Philological Notes】*Ji Jing*: Some versions write *yi*; read as *qi* in the *Qi* rhyme. Xu reads it as *ji*. ◎ Yu Yue says: Guo’s annotation, interpreting *ji jing* as 'where skill passes through,' makes little sense. The four characters *ji jing ken qing* must be parallel. The *Philological Notes* state: *Ken*, in the *Shuowen*, is written as *ken*; the *Zilin* agrees, with the pronunciation *kou nai*, meaning 'attached to bone and flesh.' Another definition: 'bone without flesh.' *Qing*: Sima says: 'like a knot.' Since *ken* and *qing* both refer to the ox’s body, *ji jing* should be understood similarly. *Ji* is likely a corruption of *zhi* (枝). The *Suwen*, "Sanbu Jiuhou Lun," states: 'Treat the *jingluo*,' with Wang’s annotation citing the *Lingshu Jing*: '*Jingmai* are internal; those that branch and run transversely are *luo*.' The ancient character *zhi* (支) is interchangeable with *zhi* (枝). *Zhi* refers to branch vessels; *jing* refers to main vessels. *Zhi jing* thus means *jingluo* (channels and collaterals). Where channels and collaterals connect, there must be obstructions to the blade’s movement. But the butcher, following their natural structure, never encounters such hindrances. ◎ Li Zhen says: Mr. Yu’s emendation of *ji* to *zhi*, interpreting it as *jingluo*, is indeed precise. The phrase *wei chang* ('never') requires supplementary explanation. Following Mr. Yu’s interpretation, *chang* should mean 'to attempt.' The *Shuowen* defines *shi* (試) as 'to use.' This means that at the slightest obstructions of *jingluo* or *ken qing*, the blade is never applied recklessly—this is what is meant by 'following their natural structure.'

*The Ken*: Xu reads it as *ku deng*. The *Shuowen* writes it as *ken*; the *Zilin* agrees, with the pronunciation *kou nai*, meaning 'attached to bone and flesh.' Another definition: 'bone without flesh.' Cui says: Xu Shen states: 'flesh between bones.' *Ken* means 'firmly attached.' *The Qing*: Read as *ku ting*; Cui, Xiang, and Xu all read it as *qi*; Li reads it as *wu xi*, with another pronunciation as *qing*. Sima says: 'like a knot.' *Jing Gai*: Read as *gu dai*. *Wei Ai*: Read as *wu dai*.

【11】【Annotation】*Gu* refers to large bones that dull the blade. 【Exegesis】*Ken qing* are where flesh adheres to bone. *Gu* are large bones. The marvel of skill lies in moving the blade through emptiness, never encountering even the slightest obstruction, let alone striking large bones. How much more so for one who cultivates life and wields wisdom, embodying true emptiness—even minor delusions do not stain the mind, so how could worldly dust defile virtue? 【Philological Notes】*Da Gu*: Read as *gu*. Xiang and Guo say: *gu* refers to large bones that resist the blade. Cui says: 'coiled, knotted bones.' *Nu Dao*: Read as *nü liu*.

【12】【Annotation】Not aligning with the natural structure. 【Exegesis】Even a skilled butcher does not perfectly align with the natural structure, requiring a new knife each year. How much more so for those of lesser learning who have not embodied the true Dao, whose minds are easily swayed by grasping emptiness and abandoning form. 【Philological Notes】*Liang Pao*: Sima says: *liang* means 'good.' *Ge Ye*: Sima says: 'using the knife to cut meat, hence replacing it yearly.' Cui says: 'replacing the knife each year still suffices for cutting.'

【13】【Annotation】Striking bone and breaking the knife. 【Exegesis】How much worse for the common and coarse, whose minds are dull and obstructed, encountering circumstances at every turn—surely they damage wisdom and harm the spirit. 【Philological Notes】*Zu Pao*: Sima says: *zu* means 'mixed.' Cui says: *zu* means 'multitude.' ◎ Yu Yue says: Guo’s annotation, 'striking bone and breaking the knife,' does not align with the text’s meaning. The preceding line states: 'A good butcher replaces his knife yearly for cutting.' *Ge* (割) refers to the knife’s use, so *zhe* (折) must also refer to the knife’s use. *Zhe* means 'to break bone,' not 'to break the knife.' The *Zuozhuan* of Duke Ai’s first year states: 'Do not break the bones.'

【14】【Annotation】*Xing* is a whetstone. 【Exegesis】*Xing* is a sharpening stone. *Shi* (十) is the number of yin; *jiu* (九) is the number of yang. Thus, nineteen years represent the ultimate marvel of yin and yang. Therefore, after nineteen years, having butchered thousands of oxen, moving through emptiness and traversing the void without dulling the blade’s edge, the knife remains as sharp as if newly whetted. How much more so for one who skillfully cultivates life, whose wisdom penetrates emptiness and form, harmonizing with the world while preserving their light—mastering the marvels of yin and yang. Though undergoing countless transformations, they constantly renew their virtue, traversing myriad realms while remaining serene and undisturbed."

【Exegesis on Characters】
*Xing* (硎) is pronounced *xíng* and means a whetstone. Cui’s edition writes it as *xíng* (形), glossing it as “newly received form.” *Dishi* (砥石) is pronounced *zhī*, or alternatively *zhǐlǚ*. The *Shangshu* commentary states: “A *di* is finer than a *lì*; both are whetstones.”

【15】【Exegesis】
The ox’s joints naturally have gaps, while the blade’s edge is sharp and thin, lacking thickness. Using a blade without thickness to enter an ox with gaps, the movement of the edge is expansive, always leaving ample space. How much more so for the scholar who nurtures life, the person who embodies the Dao—wielding the marvelous wisdom of utmost forgetfulness, roaming the realm of empty phenomena. Thus, they arrange and adapt with ease, ever at leisure and abundant in freedom, where realm and wisdom merge, neither one nor different.

【16】【Exegesis】
This reiterates the preceding passage to complete its meaning.

【17】【Annotation】
“Clan” refers to the interwoven and clustered [joints].

【18】【Annotation】
No longer directing the gaze toward other things.

【Exegesis on Characters】
*Wei jie* (为戒) is pronounced *yú wěi*. The same applies below. *Shu mu* (属目) is pronounced *zhǔ mù* (in the *Zhang* edition, *yì* is emended to *zhāng*, pronounced *zhù*).

【19】【Annotation】
To move the hand slowly.

【Exegesis】
Where the joints intertwine and coil in clusters is called a “clan.” Though the blade moves through emptiness and the gaps are clearly seen, whenever it reaches these interwoven points, one must remain mindful of the difficulty, ever cautious and vigilant, fixing the gaze and moving the hand with deliberation. How much more so for the person who embodies the Dao—though they may penetrate the illusory nature of phenomena, when realm and wisdom intersect, they must remain cautious of difficulty, never lightly entangling the roots or senses, lest they disturb the tranquility.

【20】【Annotation】
When the method is appropriate, little force is required.

【Exegesis on Characters】
*Huo ran* (謋然) is pronounced *huà bǎi*, or alternatively *xǔ* reads it as *xǔ bǎi*. *Yi jie* (已解) is pronounced *xiè*, and the same applies below.

【21】【Annotation】
Understanding the structure leaves no trace of the blade, like scattered earth.

【Exegesis】
*Huo* is pronounced *huà bǎi*. *Huo ran* is the sound of bone and flesh parting. The movement of the phoenix knife is exceedingly subtle and wondrous, following the principle of Heaven, and thus effortless—like earth falling to the ground, what trace could it leave? How much more so when wielding spiritual wisdom, illuminating the finest subtleties, traversing the dusty realm without the slightest hindrance, where realm and wisdom merge, and subject and object dissolve.

【22】【Annotation】
“Leisurely ease” means the self-possessed demeanor of a swift steed.

【Exegesis】
Having finished butchering the ox, he relaxes and wanders freely, lifting the phoenix knife and lingering idly. Then, with a bearing of pure refinement, he gazes loftily in all directions, his spirit brimming, exulting in self-possession. The principle of nurturing life is likewise.

【Exegesis on Characters】
*Ti dao* (提刀) is pronounced *tí dāo* (Xu reads it as *tú jī*). *Chou* (踌) is pronounced *zhí liú*. *Chu* (躇) is pronounced *zhí yú*.

【23】【Annotation】
To wipe the knife and sheathe it.

【Exegesis】
Because he preserves and cherishes it, he wipes and sheathes it. How much more so for the person who skillfully nurtures life—radiant yet not dazzling.

【Exegesis on Characters】
*Shan dao* (善刀): *shan* means “to wipe.” *Shi* (拭) is pronounced *shì*. *Tao zhi* (弢之) is pronounced *tāo zhī*.
◎ Lu Wenchao notes: *Tao* is phonetically derived from *□*. The old edition mistakenly wrote *you* (又) beneath *shan* (山); this has now been corrected.
【Collation】(1) The entire character is supplied following Zhao Jianyi’s edition.

(2) The text with lacunae and errors cites Liu Deyi’s *Ruhai* edition, which includes the six characters "牛不知其死也" (*an ox does not know its own death*) beneath this sentence. (3) The Zhao edition omits the characters *其* and *闲*. (4) The phrasing is adjusted following the Zhao edition. (5) The character *就* is amended according to the annotation. (6) The character *章* is revised following the original edition of the *Exegesis on Characters*.

Duke Wenhui said, “Excellent! From the words of Cook Ding, I have grasped the art of nurturing life.”【1】
【1】【Annotation】Since the knife can be nurtured, one knows that life can likewise be nurtured.
【Exegesis】Marquis Wei, upon hearing Cook Ding’s words, awakened to the Dao of nurturing life. Marveling at its divine subtlety, he thus exclaimed, “Excellent!”

Gongwen Xuan, seeing the Right Minister, was startled and said, “Who is this man? How did he come to be one-legged?【1】 Was it Heaven’s doing, or man’s?”【2】 He replied, “It was Heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him thus solitary;【3】 man’s appearance is endowed with symmetry.【4】 From this, one knows it was Heaven’s doing, not man’s.”【5】
【1】【Annotation】*Jie* refers to the condition of being one-legged.
【Exegesis】Gongwen was his surname, Xuan his given name, a man of Song. *Right Minister* was an official title. *Jie* means amputation. Gongwen, seeing the Right Minister’s amputated foot, was startled and asked the reason—what offense had he committed to suffer such mutilation?
【Exegesis on Characters】*Gongwen Xuan*: Sima [Qian] states: His surname was Gongwen, his given name Xuan, a man of Song. *Right Minister*: Sima [Qian] states: A man of Song.

Simwen states: "An official title."
*Wuhu* is pronounced *wu*. *Jie* is pronounced *jie*, also *wu*. Sima [Qian] says: "Amputation." Xiang and Guo say: "Partial amputation." Cui’s version has *wu*, also written as □, meaning "severed foot." ◎My late father remarks: "Those who skillfully nourish life nourish with spirit. When spirit is whole, life is whole—even if the form is *jie*, it matters not. The pheasant in the marsh, though its spirit is truly royal, is surely not well-nourished. Thus, spirit is that which is serene, tranquil, joyful, and unburdened, acting through non-action, at ease and self-content. It transcends the physical form, equalizes life and death—what then does *jie* signify?"
*Pianyue* is pronounced *yue*, also *wuguà* in reverse.

【2】【Annotation】What knowledge cannot contend with is Heaven’s doing. To transgress what one knows is man’s doing.
【Exegesis】Was this condition bestowed by Heaven, or did it arise from some offense against human affairs? This is Gongwen’s question.
【Exegesis on Characters】*Tian yu qi ren yu* is read *yu* in all cases, or all as their standard pronunciation. Sima [Qian] says: "Is it Heaven’s decree or man’s doing?"

【3】【Annotation】Partial amputation is called *du* (solitary). If the wisdom of a single household cannot preserve both feet, then such wisdom is powerless. Were the Right Minister to insist on preserving both, his mind and spirit would be inwardly exhausted, and his form outwardly ruined—how could it be merely partial amputation!
【Exegesis】The clarity of wisdom and the wholeness of form are both bestowed by Heaven, not determined by human affairs. Even if one violates royal law and suffers mutilation, it is Heaven that endows stupidity, rendering one incapable of self-preservation. One attributes the loss of a limb to human folly but fails to see that Heaven dims one’s wisdom. Thus, whether one is solitary or paired, it is all a matter of fate.
【Exegesis on Characters】*Shi du*: Sima [Qian] says: "One foot is called *du*." *Zhi*: pronounced *zhi* (wisdom). The same below.

【4】【Annotation】Walking with two feet is called *you yu* (having a pair). No one doubts that having a pair is a matter of fate.
【5】【Annotation】Since having a pair is fate, so too is being solitary—not man’s doing. Thus, one who grasps the nature of life does not strive for what life cannot achieve; one who grasps the nature of fate does not contend with what fate cannot alter. One simply preserves what is natural.
【Exegesis】*Yu* means "shared." All human forms have two feet for walking, bestowed by the Creator. Thus, if one foot is lost, it is also fate. This clarifies that fortune and misfortune, wisdom and folly, wholeness and impairment are all predetermined in the unseen—unrelated to skill or clumsiness. Only those who comprehend this principle can preserve life fully.

【Textual Note】*(1) "suo wu"* follows the Daoist Canon’s Chu Boxiu edition.

"The marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit is royal, it is not well-nourished."

【1】【Annotation】*Qi* means "to seek." *Fan* is what cages the pheasant. To move freely between Heaven and Earth, to roam in the realm of self-content—this is the subtlety of nourishing life. Why seek to enter a cage and be tamed!
【Exegesis】*Qi* means "to seek." *Fan zhong* is the pheasant’s cage. The marsh pheasant, following its wild nature, drinks and pecks at will, roaming freely—why would it desire to enter a cage and be tamed? This is like one who nourishes life, dwelling in serene seclusion, finding joy only in the forest’s whispers—how could they covet glory and splendor! Alternate interpretation: The *ze* resembles a pheasant but is not one; the *ze* has a long tail, while the pheasant’s is short. This refers to the *ze* pheasant.
【Exegesis on Characters】*Yi zhuo*: pronounced *shejiao*. *Bu qi*: pronounced *qi* (to seek). *Fan zhong*: pronounced *fan*. Li [Yi] says: "A fence, what cages the pheasant." Xiang and Guo concur. Cui takes it as "within a garden."

The *Miao chu* is pronounced *changlü* in reverse.

【Note】That which begins in comfort yet remains ever comfortable is the forgetting of comfort. The pheasant’s spirit reigns long and supreme, its will and *qi* brimming with ease, freely roaming the pure and boundless expanse—suddenly, it does not perceive goodness as goodness.

【Exegesis】The pheasant dwells in mountains and marshes, drinking and pecking at will, its spirit reigning long and supreme, its will and *qi* brimming with ease. At such a time, it suddenly does not perceive goodness as goodness. Once confined in a cage, its nature and temperament grow unsuited, and only then does it recall the past as surpassingly carefree. If this is so for birds, it should likewise be so for humans. This illustrates that supreme comfort is the forgetting of comfort, and supreme goodness is the forgetting of goodness.

【Exegesis on Characters】*Sui wang* is pronounced *yu kuang*, the same in the note. *Chang wang* is pronounced *ding liang*, or alternatively *zhi liang*.

【Collation】The two characters *zhi wei* follow the *Shi De Tang* edition.

When Lao Dan died, Qin Shi mourned him, crying out three times before departing.

【Note】One mourns as others mourn, one wails as others wail.

【Exegesis】Lao Jun is Laozi. His surname was Li, his given name Er, his courtesy name Boyang, and his posthumous name Lao Dan. He was a great sage, born in Ku County of Chen State. During the reign of King Ping of Zhou, he left the Zhou court, crossed the western deserts, and journeyed to Jibin. Yet in all the inner and outer classics, no trace of him remains—only here is his death mentioned, to illustrate that the principles of life and death are one, and the Dao of the ordinary and the sage are equal. This is but a parable of Zhuangzi’s invention. Lao Jun was the ancestor of the great Dao, the origin of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—how could he be subject to birth and death? Thus, he feigns that even sages undergo life and death to clarify the principle of life and death. Lao Jun’s descent to earth, his teaching, and his ascension to heaven are all recorded in the scriptures, but they are not recounted here. Qin Shi’s surname was Qin, his given name Shi; he was a scholar of the Dao, though his origins are unknown. Having mourned the dead, why linger to cry thrice? Yet he lowered himself to act as the common do, and once the rites were complete, he departed.

【Exegesis on Characters】*Lao Dan* is pronounced *tu lan*. Sima [Qian] says: "This is Laozi." *Qin Shi* is also written as *Yi*; both characters are read according to their standard pronunciation, also sounding *yi*. *San hao* is pronounced *hu gao*, the same in the note.

The disciple asked, “Was he not your friend?”¹

¹ *Annotation*: Marveling that he did not lean against the door to observe the transformation but instead wailed thrice.
*Exegesis*: Qin Shi and Lord Lao both wandered beyond the world. Having wailed and mourned, how could one call this lofty! Thus, the disciples, startled and doubtful, raised the question of whether he was a friend.

*Exegesis on Characters*: *Yi hu* (leaning against the door) is pronounced *yu qi*.

He replied, “Indeed.”¹

¹ *Exegesis*: *Ran* (indeed) means "it is so." Qin Shi answered the disciple, saying he was his friend beyond the world.

“Yet if so, is it proper to mourn him in this way?”¹

¹ *Exegesis*: One who dwells beyond the world performs the rites of the mundane, wailing and mourning thus—is this reasonable? Not yet understanding the harmony of light, the disciple pressed further.

He replied, “Indeed. At first, I thought him an ordinary man, but now I see he is not. When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young wailing as if for their mothers. Those who gathered must have spoken without seeking to speak, wept without seeking to weep. This is fleeing from Heaven and betraying one’s nature, forgetting what one has received. The ancients called this the punishment of fleeing from Heaven. His coming was timely; his going was in accord with the Dao. Abiding in timeliness and dwelling in accord, sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this the celestial suspension of bonds.”

¹ *Annotation*: The perfected one is without emotion, merely joining in the wailing of the crowd, so it is permissible.
*Exegesis*: *Ran* (indeed) means "it is permissible." Movement and stillness coincide, inner and outer harmonize in darkness, so it is permissible.

² *Exegesis*: When Qin Shi first entered to mourn, he thought the mourners were disciples beyond the world. Seeing their excessive grief, he knew they were not Lord Lao’s followers.

³ *Annotation*: Suspecting they had bestowed favors before the event, not proceeding from principle, thus incurring such deep attachment.
*Exegesis*: *Qi* means "to seek." *Bi* refers to the multitude. The sage’s heart is empty; when things stir, he responds. Pitying the masses and mourning the people, he expounds without waiting to be entreated. Thus, when he died, the people gathered, wailing in sorrow as if for their own mothers and children. This is the clinging of worldly emotion, deluded views of life and death, moved by the sage’s kindness to such lamentation. Judging by this, one knows they were not Lord Lao’s disciples.

*Exegesis on Characters*: *Shao zhe* (the young) is pronounced *shi zhao*. *Xian wu* (bestowing before) is pronounced *xi jian*, or read as written. *Li shang wang* (proceeding from principle): in one version, *wang* (proceed) is written as *zhu* (dwell).

⁴ *Annotation*: The nature one receives from Heaven has its own proper measure; it cannot be escaped, nor can it be added to.
*Exegesis*: *Shi* (this) refers to the mourners. *Bei* means "to add." Fleeing from Heaven’s nature and adding worldly emotions, deludedly seeing death as lamentable, they forget the measure they have received.

*Exegesis on Characters*: *Dun tian* (fleeing from Heaven) is pronounced *tu xun*, also written as *dun*. *Bei qing* (betraying one’s nature) is pronounced *pei*, meaning "to add," or *bu dui*. In one version, it is written as *bei* (to betray).

⁵ *Annotation*: Deeply moved by things, exceeding what is proper—this is fleeing from Heaven. Racing toward the realm of sorrow and joy, though no corporal punishment has been applied, one’s nature and emotions are already exhausted. Is this not a punishment?
*Exegesis*: Fleeing from Heaven’s principle and adding worldly emotions, sorrow and joy pass through the heart, and the spirit is afflicted as if by flogging. Is this not a punishment? The enlightened of old spoke thus.

*Exegesis on Characters*: *Da shen* (deeply moved) is pronounced *tai*. *You le* (sorrow and joy) is pronounced *luo*. The same in the text and annotation below.

⁶ *Annotation*: Timeliness arises of itself.

⁷ *Annotation*: Death is in accord with principle.

⁸ *Exegesis*: *Fu zi* (the Master) refers to Lord Lao. Qin Shi marveled at Lord Lao’s great sagacity, his profound grasp of the source. Thus, his timely birth was in accord with the season, and his serene departure was in accord with principle, returning to truth.

⁸ *Annotation*: Sorrow and joy arise from loss and gain. Now, the one who is mystically attuned and harmonizes with change is at peace in all times, abides in all accord, darkly one with creation. Then there is no going that is not oneself—what gain or loss, what death or life? Thus, following what one has received, sorrow and joy have no place to lodge.

*Exegesis*: Abiding in life’s time, one does not loathe life; dwelling in death’s accord, one does not abhor death. Amid a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, nothing is not oneself. Wherever one goes, one is at ease, so sorrow and joy do not enter the heart.

*Exegesis on Characters*: *Suo cuo* (to lodge) is pronounced *qi lu*.

⁹ *Annotation*: Those who are bound are suspended; thus, those without bonds are suspended from bonds. Being suspended from bonds, one attains the truth of nature and destiny. This is the essence of nurturing life.
*Exegesis*: *Di* (Emperor) means Heaven. Those bound by life and death are suspended; thus, those without death or life are suspended from bonds. Not being bound by life and death, not entered by sorrow and joy—this is what the ancients called the celestial suspension of bonds. Moreover, Lord Lao, the great sage, was darkly one with life and death. How could he flee from Heaven’s punishment or race toward sorrow and joy? Master Xuan’s annotation here misses the mark by far. If so, what does it mean to abide in timeliness and dwell in accord, the celestial suspension of bonds? The flow of the text contradicts itself. Thus, the punishment of fleeing from Heaven belongs to those who grieve excessively, not to Lord Lao.

*Exegesis on Characters*: *Xian* (suspended) is pronounced *xuan*.

"The *Jie* (解) is pronounced *xie*. The annotation is the same. Cui [Yun] says: taking life as suspension (*xian*), taking death as liberation (*jie*).

*Collation Notes*:
(1) The missing or erroneous text in *Quewu* cites the *Ruhai* edition as having "its [text] reaching thus."
(2) The character *dun* (遁) follows the *Shidetang* edition.
(3) The *Zhao Jianyi* edition has *zhu* (住).

'The finger is exhausted in tending the firewood, yet the fire is transmitted'—this is the first [passage]. 'One knows not its end'—this is the second [passage].

*Annotation*:
*Qiong* (穷) means "exhausted"; *wei xin* (为薪) is like *qian xin* (前薪, "prior firewood"). The prior firewood is tended by the finger, and when the finger exhausts the principle of the prior firewood, the fire is transmitted and does not extinguish. The heart attains the midst of nourishment, so life continues without cessation. This clarifies that nurturing life is the very means by which life is generated.

*Exegesis*:
*Qiong* (穷) means "exhausted." *Xin* (薪) is firewood. *Wei* (为) means "prior." When a person kindles fire, they use their hand to tend it. One who exhausts the principle of kindling fire—though the prior firewood is consumed, the subsequent firewood continues it, and as prior and subsequent follow one another, the fire does not extinguish. This is just like one who skillfully nurtures life: following change, yielding to transformation, and moving together with things. Thus, one renews oneself without attachment, never ceasing to be oneself, and so continues without end.

*Exegesis on Characters*:
'*Zhi qiong yu wei xin*' (指穷于为薪) is read as written, with a pause after the phrase. *Wei* (为) means "prior."
'*Huo chuan ye*' (火传也) is pronounced *zhuan* (专) in the level tone. The annotation is the same. *Chuan* (传) means "transmitted in succession."
Cui [Yun] says: "Firewood and fire" refers to torch fire. *Chuan* (传) means "to extend."
◎ Yu Yue says: Guo’s annotation states, "*Wei xin* (为薪) is like *qian xin* (前薪, 'prior firewood'), and the prior firewood is tended by the finger. When the finger exhausts the principle of the prior firewood, the fire is transmitted and does not extinguish." This explanation is hardly clear. Moreover, the gloss of *wei* (为) as "prior" is of unknown meaning.

Guo’s annotation is incorrect. The *Guangya Shigu* states: "取 (*qu*) means 为 (*wei*)." Thus, 为 (*wei*) is also like 取 (*qu*, "to take"). "*Zhi qiong yu wei xin*" (指穷于为薪) means "the finger exhausts itself in taking firewood." If one uses the finger to take firewood and ignite it, there will be insufficiency. But if one allows the fire to transmit itself, it flares suddenly without one realizing the firewood has been consumed. Guo grasped the pronunciation but not the meaning. The *Shiwen* cites Cui [Yun], saying, "薪火 (*xinhuo*) is torch fire," which also misconstrues the pronunciation.

◎ My late ancestor [Jia Shifu] said: When firewood is exhausted, the fire is transmitted, and something inexhaustible remains. The qi of the Great Void comes and goes; humans receive it to live, just as firewood transmits fire. Its coming cannot be resisted, nor its going detained—it ceases only when the firewood is spent. Yet the firewood is itself fire, and fire transmits itself; thus, it is taken as inexhaustible. To grasp firewood in search of fire, or to grasp fire in search of transmission—how could this be fitting?

《之中》 is pronounced *ding zhong* in the falling tone.

【二】【Annotation】 Time does not return, and the present does not pause even once. Thus, human life is but one breath, one attainment. The previous breath is not the present breath, so nourishment is received and life continues. The prior fire is not the later fire, so firewood is provided and fire is transmitted. Fire is transmitted and life continues because nourishment reaches its utmost. How could the world know that exhaustion gives way to renewed life!

【Exegesis】 The deluded and forgetful, bound by emotions and attachments, do not understand that the new is ever-unceasing, thought after thought flowing onward. Yesterday’s self is already spent today, and today’s self is reborn in what follows.

Originally, this chapter was divided into seven sections to clarify its meaning, but the structure seemed overly cumbersome. Now, "For Goodness" is merged with the first section, and "Fingers Exhausted" with "Laozi," consolidating it into five chapters to avoid ambiguity.

【Collation】 The Zhao Jianyi edition does not repeat the phrase "fire is transmitted."

*Book Two, Inner Chapters*

**Chapter Four: Among the Human World**

**[1] [Commentary]**
To engage with human society is to be inseparable from others. Yet the vicissitudes of the human world differ with each generation, and only those without fixed intent or self-assertion can adapt to change without bearing its burdens.

**[Exegesis]**
*"Among the Human World"* refers to the affairs commonly encountered in human society.

◎ **Qing Fan’s Note:**
The *Wen Xuan* annotation to Pan Anren’s *"Autumn Stirrings"* cites Sima Biao: "It speaks of conducting oneself fittingly in the human world and governing amid chaos. To engage with human society is to be inseparable from others. Yet the affairs of the human world differ from age to age, and only those without fixed intent or self-assertion can adapt to change without being weighed down by it."

**Yan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and asked to depart.**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Yan Hui, surnamed Yan, given name Hui, courtesy name Ziyuan, was a native of Lu. Among Confucius’ three thousand disciples, he was one of the foremost, admitted to the inner circle across the Four Categories. Confucius, surnamed Kong, given name Qiu, courtesy name Zhongni, was also a native of Lu, a descendant of the Shang dynasty’s Tang, born in the declining Zhou era. Endowed with sagely virtue, he was Yan Hui’s teacher. The roots and deeds of these two are thoroughly recorded in the Confucian histories. However, as this text explicates the *Zhuangzi*, its intent lies in the profound and subtle, so we shall not dwell on trivial details. Yet the affairs of the human world are tangled and fraught with difficulty, and the principle of benefiting others through interaction is not easily grasped. Thus, the text invokes Yan and Kong to illustrate the methods of transformation and guidance, entrusting these sages with the art of "fasting the mind."

*(A sagely Confucius, a worthy Yan Hui.)*

**[Exegesis]**
Yan Hui: A disciple of Confucius, surnamed Yan, given name Hui, courtesy name Ziyuan, a native of Lu.

**Confucius asked, "Where are you going?"**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
*"Where"* (奚) means "what." *"Going"* (之) means "to proceed." The question asks where Yan Hui intends to travel.

**Yan Hui replied, "I intend to go to Wei."**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Wei was the capital of King Zhou of the Shang and the fief of Kang Shu. Today, it corresponds to Weizhou in Jixian. This is Yan Hui’s answer to Confucius’ question about his destination.

**Confucius asked, "What will you do there?"**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
What purpose does he have in going to Wei? The question presses Yan Hui further on his intentions.

**Yan Hui said, "I have heard that the Lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and does not recognize his faults. He treats the lives of his people as of little account, and the dead are measured by the state as if they were reeds in a marsh—his people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, Master: *'Flee a well-ordered state; go to a disordered one. A physician’s gate is crowded with the sick.'* I wish to apply what I have heard and ponder its principles, hoping that the state might yet be cured!"**

**[1] [Commentary]**
*(He does not share the people’s desires.)*

**[Exegesis]**
The Lord of Wei refers to Kuai Kui, son of Duke Ling. Dissolute and reckless, he indulged his passions without restraint. Though young and formidable, his conduct was violent and contrary to the people’s will. Yan Hui recounts what he has heard to answer Confucius.

**[Exegesis]**
**The Lord of Wei:** Sima Biao states: "This is Kuai Kui, Duke Zhuang of Wei." According to the *Zuozhuan*, Duke Zhuang of Wei first entered the state in the winter of the fifteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu. By then, Yan Hui had already died, so this cannot refer to Duke Zhuang—it must be Duke Chu.
*"His conduct"* (其行): *qí xíng*, read as *xià mèng*.
*"Willful"* (獨): Cui states: "Self-willed." Xiang states: "Different from others." Guo states: "Does not share the people’s desires."

**[2] [Commentary]**
One who rules others acts through them. In anger, corpses lie strewn and blood flows; in joy, carriages and caps fill the roads. Thus, the ruler’s use of the state cannot be taken lightly.

**[Exegesis]**
The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace. If one cannot cherish the common folk but instead treats their lives with disdain, how can the state avoid ruin?

**[3] [Commentary]**
*(No one dares to remonstrate.)*

**[Exegesis]**
His strength is sufficient to reject counsel, his eloquence to gloss over faults. Thus, the people are cowed into silence, and though he errs, none dare admonish him.

**[4] [Commentary]**
*(He treats them as if sending them to their deaths.)*

**[Exegesis]**
Unsettled in stillness or motion, he remains complacent, treating the people of his state as if casting them into death.

**[5] [Commentary]**
*(The entire state is delivered to death, beyond counting—he regards them as mere grass and reeds.)*

**[Exegesis]**
*"Reeds"* (蕉) means grass and reeds. Whether through incessant warfare or oppressive taxation, the dead are innumerable. To describe their multitude, the state itself is the measure; to enumerate them would be hasty and impossible. Indulging himself without regard for the people, he views them as reeds in a marsh.

**[Exegesis]**
*"Measured by the state"* (國量): *guó liàng*, read as *liàng*.
*(Li: *lì zhāng*, read as *lì zhāng*.)*

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"Ruò jiāo"* (若蕉): *sì yáo* (似遙) *fǎn* (反). Xú (徐) reads *zài yáo* (在堯) *fǎn* (反). Xiàng (向) says: "grass and reeds." Cuī (崔) says: "to mow and reap; its marsh appears as if mown down, speaking of the wilds devoid of green grass." ◎Lú Wénchāng (卢文弨) says: *Jiāo* (蕉) is also identical with *qiáo* (樵), hence it may be glossed as "to mow down." ◎Jiā Shìfù (家世父) says: *Jiāo* (蕉) is interchangeable with *jiāo* (焦). The *Fēngsú Tōng* (风俗通) states: "Where water and grass intermingle is called a marsh. When it resembles *jiāo* (焦), the waters dry up and the grasses wither, as if scorched by fire, corresponding to the *Shī* (诗)'s meaning of 'like burning, like conflagration.'" In the *Zuǒzhuàn* (左传), Duke Chéng's ninth year: "Though there be the Ji and Jiang clans, do not abandon the *jiāo* (蕉) and *cuì* (萃)." Bān Gù's *Bīn Xì* (宾戏): "By morning in bloom, by evening scorched and withered." The graphs *jiāo* (蕉) and *jiāo* (焦) are interchangeable. The *Bóyǎ* (博雅) states: "*Jiāo* (蕉) means black, and also corresponds to *jiāo* (焦)." Lù (陆)氏's *Yīnyì* (音义) cites Xiàng's gloss of "grass and reeds" and Cuī's gloss of "to mow and reap," both in error.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"Chēng shù"* (称数): *suǒ zhǔ* (所主) *fǎn* (反).

**[6] [Commentary]**
*(No place to turn for refuge.)*

**[Exegesis]**
When the ruler above lacks the Dao, ministers and people suffer famine. Not only is there nothing to be done, but there is also nowhere to turn.

**[7] [Exegesis]**
*Shù* (庶) means "to hope." *Jī* (几) means "near." *Chōu* (瘳) means "to recover."

Governing a state in peaceful tranquility requires no external aid or support; a disordered nation in solitary peril must be met with admonition and remonstrance. Now that Master Yán is about to transform Wèi, he recounts what he once heard, reflecting on the teachings he received, hoping they may draw near to the virtuous Dao. It is like the gate of physicians, where many can cure illness—just as this worthy scholar must surely be able to rescue from peril. For the malady of dissipation and excess, there is hope for recovery.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"Zhìguó"* (治国): *zhí lì* (直吏) *fǎn* (反).
*"Yīmén"* (医门): *yú qí* (于其) *fǎn* (反).
*"Sī qí zé"* (思其则): end of sentence.
Cuī and Lǐ state: *zé* (则) means "law."
*"Yǒu chōu"* (有瘳): *chǒu yóu* (丑由) *fǎn* (反).
Lǐ states: "to recover."

**[Collation]**
(1) The *Quēwù* cites the Jiāngnán Lǐ edition, which includes the characters *suǒ xíng* (所行) below, making *zé* (则) the beginning of the next sentence.

Confucius said: "Alas! You are nearly going to your punishment!" **[1]**
**[1] [Commentary]**
His Way is insufficient to save that affliction.

**[Exegesis]**
*Hēi* (嘻) is the sound of astonished laughter. *Ruò* (若) means "you." *Dài* (殆) means "near."

Confucius scoffed at the shallowness of his methods, deeming them insufficient to transform others. "If you go to Wei," he warned, "you will surely meet execution."

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"Xī"* (嘻): *xī* (熙), also *yú qí* (于其) *fǎn* (反).
**[Collation]**
(1) The *Quēwù* cites the Zhāng Jūnfáng edition, where *dài* (殆) appears below *ér* (而).

The Dao does not tolerate admixture. **[1]**
**[1] [Commentary]**
It must find its proper vessel.

Admixture leads to excess, excess to disorder, disorder to anxiety, and anxiety to helplessness. **[2]**
**[2] [Commentary]**
If the proper vessel is not found, then even a hundred physicians attending a single illness will only deepen doubt and fail to effect a cure.

The perfected ones of antiquity first established the Way within themselves before extending it to others. **[3]**
**[3] [Commentary]**
Only when one possesses the requisite capacity can one engage with the world.

If what is established within oneself remains unsettled, how can one presume to meddle in the conduct of violent men? **[4]**
**[4] [Commentary]**
To confront difficulties without an empty mind, expending thought in reckless endeavor, reveals that what is established within oneself remains unstable. Only by externalizing knowledge to nurture the authentic, entrusting mastery to the many talents, ascribing merit to others while distancing oneself

If one acts for the sake of pretense—*suǒwéi* (所为) pronounced as *yúwěi* (于伪)—and if one contends over goodness—*zhēngshàn* (争善), here and below the phrase "contend over name" (*zhēngmíng* 争名) is read character by character—then even tyrants like Jie and outlaws like Zhi, though their cherished values differ, ultimately prize nothing but fame and goodness.

**[2] [Commentary]**
Fame and wisdom are what the world employs. Yet when fame arises, mutual conflict (*zhé* 轧) ensues; when wisdom is put to use, contention flourishes. Only by relinquishing fame and knowledge can one’s conduct be fully realized.

**[Commentary]**
*Zhá* (札) means harm. To prize fame is to invite mutual slander; to display wisdom is to provoke rivalry. Thus, both are instruments of misfortune and cannot be fully practiced in the world.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Xiāngzhá* (相札): Xu pronounces it *yúbā* (于八), also *zéliè* (侧列). Li says: "to break." Cui says: "to cut short." Also written as *zhé* (轧). Cui further notes: "or written as *lǐ* (礼), meaning mutual courtesy." ◎ Lu Wenchang: The current text reads *zhé* (轧). ◎ Qingfan’s note: *Xiāngzhá* means "to clash like armor." *Guǎngyǎ* states: "*Zhá* (札) means armor"; the modern text mistakenly writes it as *lǐ* (礼). Also: "chariot yokes are *jiāozhá* (焦札)"; *Taiping Yulan* cites it as *zhuīlǐ* (鵻礼), while manuscript copies render it *jiāolǐ* (鹪礼). The ancient character for *lǐ* (礼) resembles *zhá* (札), so *zhá* was miswritten as , later altered to *lǐ* (礼). Cui’s note that *zhá* (札) may be written as *lǐ* (礼) also stems from the resemblance. (*Huainanzi’s* "Sayings of the Forest" reads: "Birds’ strength prevails by day but succumbs to □*lǐ* (礼)," where *lǐ* is also a corruption of *zhá* (札).)

**[Collation]**
(1) *Zhé* (轧) follows the Zhao Jianyi edition and the Shidetang edition; Lu’s collation also reads *zhé* (轧).
(2) The Song edition reads □, likely a corrupted form of *zhì* (至).
(3) "Cannot be fully" (*bùkě jìn* 不可尽) follows the main text and commentary.

Moreover, one whose virtue is profound, whose trust is steadfast, and whose integrity is unshaken may yet fail to grasp the *qi* of others; one whose reputation spreads without contention may yet fail to move the hearts of others. **[1]** To forcibly impose the language of benevolence, righteousness, and moral standards before violent men is to make others resent what they should admire—this is called "harming others." **[2]** One who harms others will inevitably be harmed in return. **[3]** Is this not perilously close to inviting harm upon oneself?

Furthermore, if one delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? **[4]** If one refuses to issue decrees, kings and lords will surely exploit others to vie for advantage. **[5]** Then the eyes will be dazzled, **[6]** the complexion will be smoothed, **[7]** the mouth will be deceived, **[8]** the demeanor will be feigned, **[9]** and the mind will be corrupted. **[10]** This is like extinguishing fire with fire, or flooding water with water—it is called "adding to excess." **[11]** To follow such a beginning without end **[12]** is to risk, through insincere grand words, certain death before violent men. **[13]**

**[1] [Commentary]**
*Qiàng* (矼) means "firm." Suppose one’s virtue is pure and profound, one’s conduct trustworthy and steadfast, one’s reputation noble and uncontested—yet if the ruler remains obstinate, cruel, and lacking in discernment, failing to comprehend Yan Hui’s *qi* or recognize the intent to rectify, what then?

**[Textual Notes]**
*Xìnqiàng* (信矼): Xu pronounces it *gǔjiāng* (古江). Cui reads it *kòng* (控).

**[2] [Commentary]**
Jianwen states: "It means 'true appearance.'"

**[Annotation]**
When one offers a night-shining pearl to another, few do not reach for their swords—this is because they do not comprehend it. Now, Yan Hui’s virtue and trustworthiness, along with his reputation for non-contention, are things the other has not yet grasped. If one forcibly applies the standards of benevolence and righteousness to him, he will assume that Yan Hui seeks to destroy others to establish himself. Therefore, the perfected person does not exert their will to order the world but instead responds to things with an empty mind. Sincerity and trust manifest in heaven and earth, non-contention flows through the myriad things, and only then do the myriad things return to embrace them, heaven and earth do not oppose them. Thus, when their virtuous reputation spreads, the world resonates in harmony; when their illustrious conduct shines, the six directions all respond. Only after this may one traverse cold and heat, navigate order and chaos, and avoid clashing with the dragon’s reversed scales.

**[Commentary]**
The words of the carpenter’s line refer to the sagely wisdom of the Five Virtues. Yan Hui’s virtuous nature is not yet understood by the ruler of Wei, yet if one forcibly employs the techniques of benevolence and righteousness before a violent man, the fine words of the former kings he conveys will surely incur the ruler’s hatred—thus, it cannot be done.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Ér qiǎng* (而强): pronounced *qí liǎng* in both cases. The annotation is the same.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current text reads *qiǎng* (强). The same applies throughout the book without repetition.
◎ Jia Shifu states: In the *Ji Yi*, "bind them in the heart, manifest them in countenance, and *shù* (术) them"—Zheng’s annotation reads: *shù* (术) should be *shù* (述). *Shù* before a violent man means to convey them before a violent man.
*Rén è yǒu* (人恶有): pronounced *wū lù* (乌路). The same applies to *è* (恶) in "not good" and the annotation.
◎ Cui’s edition has *yǒu* (有) as *yù* (育), glossed as "to sell."
◎ Yu Yue states: The *Shiwen* glosses *è* (恶) as *wū lù* (乌路), which is incorrect. Since "beauty" and "ugliness" are contrasted in the text, it should be read in its original sense. *Yǒu* (有) is an error for *yù* (育). The *Shiwen* notes that Cui’s edition reads *yù* (育), glossed as "to sell." The *Shuowen*, under the *bèi* (贝) radical, states: *yù* (□), meaning "to sell," read like *yù* (育). This *yù* (育) is a loan for *yù* (□), and the classics and histories often use *yù* (鬻) for it, which is also pronounced *yù* (育). "Using others’ ugliness to *yù* (育) one’s own beauty" means using others’ ugliness to sell one’s own beauty.
*Xiǎn bù* (鲜不): pronounced *xī qiǎn* (息浅).
*Shè zhì* (涉治): pronounced *zhí lì* (直吏).

« *Wǔ* (迕) » is pronounced *wù* (误).

【3】
**Annotation:** If one does not trust and accept [the advice] appropriately, one will assume it competes for reputation and thus retaliate with harm.
**Subcommentary:** *Mìng* (命) means "reputation." The Lord of Wei fails to comprehend your intentions, believing you bring disaster upon him. Once suspicion and doubt arise, he will inevitably suffer retribution.

« *Zāi* (菑) » is pronounced *zāi* (灾). The same applies below.

【4】
**Annotation:** If one can delight in the worthy and despise the foolish, heeding the Way and submitting to it, one becomes an enlightened ruler. If one is an enlightened ruler, then one does not *suffer* from a lack of worthy ministers. Your going there would no longer be extraordinary. If one does not act thus, going will surely bring harm. Therefore, to go with intention is to go without possibility; to respond without intention is to have response arise naturally—then there is no going that is impossible.
**Subcommentary:** *Dài* (殆) means "near." *Fú* (夫) is an exclamation. If you go to Wei, you will draw near to peril and destruction, suffering calamity at the hands of a violent man—deeply lamentable indeed! Moreover, if the Lord of Wei can delight in and cherish the worthy, despising the unworthy, then his court will abound with gentlemen while petty men are cast aside. He already has loyal ministers—what need has he of you? Your arrival there would be no different from those already present. Since there is no distinction, your departure would bring no benefit.

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Zāifū* (菑夫) is read as *fú*. *Bùxiào* (不肖) is read as *xiào*; *Xú* reads it as *sūjiào* (苏叫反), meaning "to resemble." *Wùyòng* (恶用) is read as *wū*. **Chapter Five**

**Commentary:**
You should remain utterly silent and speechless. If you speak, the king and duke will surely exploit their sovereign authority to engage in verbal sparring, using clever rhetoric to reject remonstrance and conceal their faults.

**Subcommentary:**
*Zhào* (诏) means "to speak." *Wánggōng* (王公) refers to the Lord of Wei. If you go to Wei, you must remain utterly silent. Should you offer admonition or counsel, you will surely suffer humiliation and harm. Moreover, the Lord of Wei relies on the might of a thousand chariots and wields the authority of the five ranks, concealing his faults and rejecting advice, pitting his swift eloquence against others. Already gripped by fear, how could you find the leisure to correct and support him?

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Ruòwéi* (若唯): *Guō* reads it as written; another pronunciation is *wéiguǐ* (唯癸反). *Wúzhào* (无诏) is a complete phrase. *Zhào* means "to inform" or "to speak." *Cuī*’s version writes it as *è* (詻), pronounced *dá* (), meaning "to strike in opposition." *Wánggōng bìjiāng chéngrén* (王公必将乘人) is a complete phrase. *Érdòu qíjié* (而斗其捷): *jié* is read as *jiē* (接反). *Cuī* reads: *ruòwéi wú è wánggōng* (若唯无詻王公) as a complete phrase, followed by *bìjiāng chéngrén ér dòu* (必将乘人而斗) as another. *Jié* is written as *jiē* (接), meaning "to continue in succession."

**Chapter Six**

**Commentary:**
His words are so swift and persuasive that they dazzle the eyes.

**Subcommentary:**
Though the Lord of Wei is dissolute and tyrannical, he is exceptionally eloquent and perceptive. Clinging to the authority of his royal position, he tramples and oppresses those who offer loyal counsel. Thus, Yan Hui’s heart fills with dread, and his eyes grow dazed and bewildered.

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Yíngzhī* (荧之) is read as *hùjiōng* (户扃反). *Xiàng Cuī*’s version writes it as *yíng* (营), also pronounced *yíng*. **Qing Fan’s Note:** The characters *yíng* (营) and *yíng* (荧) were interchangeable in antiquity, both serving as loan characters for *mào* (□). The *Shuowen* states: *Mào* (□) means "confusion," composed of *mù* (目) and *yíng* (荧) as a phonetic component. The *Yupian* gives two pronunciations: *wéi* (唯) and *bìng* (并), both read as *hútíng* (胡亭). The character may also be written as *yíng* (荧), interchangeable with *yíng* (营) or *róng* (荣). In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Confucius’ Hereditary House* reads: "A commoner who *yínghuò* (荧惑) the feudal lords"—*yíng* (荧) in *Sima Zhen*’s version is written as *yíng* (营). In the *Book of Han*, the *Biographies of King Liu Bi of Wu* and *Prince Liu An of Huainan* write *yínghuò* (营惑), while the *Records of the Grand Historian* writes *yínghuò* (荧惑). In the *Yi Jing*, the *Xiàng* commentary to the *Fǒu* hexagram reads: "One cannot be *róng* (荣) with emolument"—*Yú Fān*’s version writes *róng* (荣) as *yíng* (营), meaning "one cannot be deluded by emolument." In the *Book of Han*, *Treatise on Ritual and Music*, *yíng* (莹) is written as *yíng* (营), while the *Han Records* writes *róng* (荣) for *yíng* (营). These are all examples of such usage. *Yǎnxuàn* (眼眩) is read as *xuánbiàn* (玄遍反).

**[7] Annotation:** Unable to distinguish oneself again from that other.
**Subcommentary:** Even if harboring admonitory intent, one dare not openly dissent; countenance and demeanor remain compliant, harmonizing with that other in peace.

**[8] Annotation:** No leisure even to save or extricate oneself.
**Subcommentary:** As the Marquis of Wei held both rank and prestige, his majesty and awe inspired fear. Yan feared calamity would befall him, beset by a hundred anxieties. Thus, his words and tongue served only to preserve himself, leaving no moment of respite.

**[9] Subcommentary:** *Xíng* (形) means "to manifest."
Fearing disaster, he yielded in submission, following in appearance—raising his hands in reverence, kneeling in obeisance, bowing in humility—such traces manifestly apparent.
**Exegesis:** *"Róng jiāng xíng zhī"* (容将形之) refers to raising the hands and kneeling.

**[10] Annotation:** Then even relinquishing oneself to follow that other.
**Subcommentary:** Not only did his outward form comply, but his inner heart also aligned, unable to advance goodness while further enabling that other’s evil.

**[11] Annotation:** Unable to rescue, one instead only strengthens that other’s power.
**Subcommentary:** *Yǐ* (以) means "to employ."
Employing fire to extinguish fire only fans the flames more fiercely; employing water to quell water only swells the waves further. Thus, Yanzi’s conduct merely emboldened the Marquis of Wei’s tyranny. Unable to correct or admonish, his actions may be said to have compounded the harm.

**[12] Annotation:** Clinging to the ordinary and preserving the old, unwilling to change.
**[13] Annotation:** To admonish without first establishing trust is to invite harm, even with earnest words.
**Subcommentary:** Your sincere and earnest counsel, if not trusted, will—though offered with utmost loyalty—only court execution before a tyrannical ruler.
**Collation:**
(1) The missing character in *Quēwù* is rendered as *xuàn* (衒) in the Jiangnan ancient manuscript.
(2) The character *kǔ* (苦) is emended following the *Shìdétáng* edition.

(3) The character *yíng* (营) is emended following the *Hanshu*.

Moreover, in ancient times, Jie executed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou executed Prince Bigan—both had cultivated their persons to humbly nurture the people below and to oppose their rulers above. Thus, their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. These were men who prized reputation.

In former days, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became desolate and ravaged, their persons subjected to punishment and execution. Their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no end. These were all men who sought reputation and substance—have you alone not heard of this? Reputation and substance are what even the sage cannot master, how much less one such as you!

**[1] Annotation:** Guan Longfeng and Bigan, dwelling below yet taking on the cares of those above, acted beyond their proper station.
**Subcommentary:** According to the *Laws of Posthumous Names*, "plundering the people and slaughtering many" is called *Jie*, while "destroying righteousness and diminishing goodness" is called *Zhou*. Guan was the surname, Longfeng the style, of a worthy minister of Xia Jie, who was beheaded for his utmost sincerity. Bigan, a paternal uncle of Yin Zhou, was disemboweled for his loyal remonstrance. *Yǔfǔ* means to cherish and nurture; *fú* means to oppose and defy. These two men were both worthy aides of antiquity, who cultivated their persons, upheld loyalty and integrity, and from their positions as ministers below, concerned themselves with the people of their rulers above. The ministers possessed virtue while the rulers lacked the Dao; opposing their lords, they both suffered execution and disgrace. Citing the ancients to admonish the present serves as a mirror and warning. From this, we know that Yan Hui’s transformation of Wei was a principle that could not be put into practice.

《Guan Longfeng》 was a worthy minister of Xia Jie. 《Prince Bigan》 was a paternal uncle of Yin Zhou.

《Below》: *xiájià* (遐嫁) reversed.
《伛》: *yūfǔ* (纡甫) reversed.
《拊》: Xu Xiang reads as *fǔ* (抚).
Li [Yun] says: *yǔfǔ* means to cherish and love.
Cui [Yuan] says: It is like *ǒuxǔ* (呕呴), meaning to nurture.
《拂其》: *fúqí* (符弗) reversed.
Cui [Yuan] says: It means to defy.
Also read as *fèi* (芳弗) reversed.

[2] [Annotation] He did not wish to allow ministers to have the reputation of surpassing their rulers.
[Exegesis] *Jǐ* means to cast down, to entrap, to poison. Xia Jie and Yin Zhou, rulers without the Dao, failed to measure themselves and still coveted fame. Thus, taking advantage of the cultivation of worthy ministers, they wantonly poisoned and entrapped them. Their intent was to vie for reputation and profit, leading to such consequences. [Exegesis ends]

[Phonetic Gloss] 《以挤》: Xu reads as *zǐjì* (子计), also *zǐlǐ* (子礼).
Sima [Biao] says: It means to poison.
Another says: It means to entrap.
*Fāngyán* says: It means to destroy.
Jianwen says: It means to push aside.
《是好》: *hūbào* (呼报) reversed.
《欲令》: *lìchéng* (力呈) reversed.

[3] [Annotation] Tyrannical rulers not only seek to indulge their desires but also pursue fame; however, what they seek is not the Way.
[Exegesis] The two rulers Yao and Yu have already been explained earlier. *Cóngzhī* (丛枝), *Xū’áo* (胥敖), and *Yǒuhù* (有扈) are all names of states. *Yǒuhù* refers to present-day Hu County in Yongzhou. A dwelling without people is called *xū* (虚); a ghost without descendants is called *lì* (厉). These three rulers, all without the Dao, delighted in raising arms and waging war against other states. Not only did they covet material gain, but they also schemed for empty fame, leading their territories to become barren mounds, their people to perish, their own bodies to suffer execution, and their ancestral temples to collapse. The pursuit of fame and profit leads to such ends—this is known to all from ancient times to the present, yet you alone have not heard of it? [Exegesis ends]

[Phonetic Gloss] 《丛支》: *cáigōng* (才公) reversed. ◎Lu Wenchang notes: The current text reads *zhī* (枝).
《有扈》: *yǒuhù* (音户). Sima [Biao] says: A state name, located in Shiping Commandery. According to the present case, it is Hu County in Jingzhao.
《虚厉》: Read as written, also *xū* (墟). Li [Yun] says: A dwelling without people is called *xū*; one who dies without descendants is called *lì*. ◎Qingfan notes: *Xūlì* (虚厉) is the same as *xūlì* (虚戾). The *Mozi*’s *Lu Wen* chapter uses *xūlì* to describe a state; the *Zhao Ce* uses *xūlì* for Qi, both written as *lì* (戾). *Lì* (戾) and *lì* (厉) share ancient pronunciation and meaning. The *Shijing*’s *Xiaoya Jie Nanshan* chapter reads *jiàng cǐ dà lì* (降此大戾), while the *Daya Zhan’ang* chapter writes *lì* as *lì* (厉). The *Xiaowan Hanfei* chapter reads *hàn fēi lì tiān* (翰飞戾天), and the *Wen Xuan Xidu Fu* [annotation] cites the *Han Shi* as writing *lì* (厉). The *Mengzi Teng Wengong* chapter reads *láng lì* (狼戾), while the *Yantielun Weitong* chapter writes it as *liánglì* (梁厉). All serve as evidence.

[4] [Annotation] Rulers who covet fame and profit, even if they were Yao or Yu, could not be transformed by virtue. Thus, they were attacked by the masses. Yet you intend to go empty-handed and transform them with the Dao?
[Exegesis] Common tyrants and violent rulers, coveting profit and seeking fame, could not be won over by the virtue of even the sage-kings Yao and Yu; rather, they raised armies to punish and eliminate the wicked. How much less could Yanzi, a common man, transform them with empty hands? The impossibility of this is beyond doubt. [Exegesis ends]

Though this be so, if you must have your reasons, try explaining them to me!

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Formerly written as *yú yù* (鱼豫) [in fanqie], an error. Now corrected.

Yan Hui said, “If one maintains proper form while emptying the mind, and strives with singleness of purpose, might this suffice?”

[1] [Annotation] To rectify one’s form and empty one’s heart.
[Exegesis] To rectify one’s form is to fulfill the reverence of a minister; to empty the mind and open the thoughts is to exhaust the sincerity of remonstrance. Having received this noble command, I dare to explain my reasoning.

[2] [Annotation] To speak with deference and without duplicity.
[Exegesis] To exert oneself in body and mind, devoting all sincerity to the state, with words and deeds loyal and careful, so that no discrepancy arises.

[3] [Exegesis] Might one proceed with these two methods?
[The Master] said, “Alas! How could this suffice?

For one whose yang is full to overflowing and widely displayed, whose countenance shifts without constancy—this is what the common people dare not oppose. One seizes upon what moves others, suppressing and crushing them to seek ease and indulgence of the heart. This is called a virtue that daily diminishes and never matures—how much less could great virtue be achieved! Such a one will cling rigidly without transformation, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding. How could this ever be acceptable?”

[1] [Annotation] This means it is not possible.
[Exegesis] *Wū è*—how could it be? How could this suffice? It means it is not possible.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Wū è* (恶恶), both read as *wū*; same below.

[2] [Annotation] The nature of the Lord of Wei is one of excessive yang, swelling within and flaunted without—such is the height of arrogance and force.
[Exegesis] *Yang* means hardness and fierceness. *Chōng* means fullness. *Kǒng* means extreme. The Lord of Wei’s fierce and hard nature fills his inner being, and his violence is extreme, manifesting outwardly.

[3] [Annotation] His joy and anger are without constancy.
[Exegesis] When things go his way, he rejoices; when they do not, he rages. His spirit, countenance, and qi show no fixed pattern.

[4] [Annotation] None dare oppose him.
[Exegesis] His nature is violent and cruel, his might and severity constant. How could worthy ministers and wise advisors dare to contradict him?

[5] [Annotation] One so utterly obstinate, when moved by others’ pleasing actions, tramples and crushes them to seek leisure and self-indulgence, gratifying his extravagant desires.
[Exegesis] *Àn* means to suppress. *Róngyǔ* means to indulge or let loose. When others move him with good and pleasing remonstrance, the lord seizes upon their loyal admonitions to suppress and crush them, seeking pleasure and indulgence to satisfy his dissolute intentions.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Cuò zhī* (挫之), read as *zǐ wò*. *Cóngróng* (从容), read as *qī róng*.

[6] [Annotation] His words, whether few or many, cannot overcome his unyielding obstinacy.
[Exegesis] The Lord of Wei has long been without the Way. Even if his virtue were to be gradually cultivated day by day, it could not be perfected—how much less could one hope for the vast and sagely brilliance of the Great Model!

[7] [Annotation] Thus he clings to his original intent.
[Exegesis] Adorning his faults, this benighted ruler cannot accept remonstrance as swiftly as flowing water. Stubbornly fixed on his own mind, who would willingly turn from evil to good for him?

[8] [Annotation] Outwardly compliant yet inwardly uncritical, this is but a momentary pretense of emptiness and effort—such words are insufficient to transform him.
[Exegesis] Externally, he raises his hands and kneels in utmost reverence; inwardly, he submits without daring to criticize. Even if one were to petition thus, what benefit would it bring? How could this be the Way to transform Wei? This merely rejects the earlier art of feigned emptiness as unfit for use.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Bù zǐ* (不訾), read as *xiàng xú* (向徐) with the sound *zǐ*. Cui says: "to slander."

---

"Then am I inwardly straight yet outwardly bent, complete yet aligned with what is above.
[1] Being inwardly straight is to follow Heaven as one’s companion. One who follows Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven—why then should one alone seek that others approve of one’s words, or seek that others disapprove?
[2] If one acts thus, people will call one a child—this is what it means to follow Heaven as one’s companion.
[3] Being outwardly bent is to follow others as one’s companion. Raising the hands, kneeling, and bowing in submission are the rites of a minister—everyone does this, so how could I alone refuse? To do what others do is to incur no blame from them;
[4] this is what it means to follow others as one’s companion.
[5] Being complete yet aligned with what is above is to follow the ancients as one’s companion.
[6] Though one’s words may instruct, in truth they are deceptive.
[7] What the ancients possessed is not what I possess.
[8] If one acts thus, though straight, one remains free from harm—
[9] this is what it means to follow the ancients as one’s companion.
[10] Can this be acceptable?"

[1] *Annotation:* Yan Hui further expounds these three principles.
*Exegesis:* Having previously set forth two matters and met with reproach, he now proposes three principles, hoping they may find accord.
This introduces the topic; below follows the explication of its meaning—Yan Hui presents his own views to gauge Confucius’ response.

[2] *Annotation:* All things, noble or base, share the same life. Thus, whether good or not good, one entrusts it to impartial rightness, seeking nothing from others.
*Exegesis:* Below follows the explication of the meaning.
*Qí* means "to seek." He says: My inner heart is plain and sincere, aligning itself as a companion to the natural principle. Knowing that emperors and I alike receive our nature from Heaven, how could I cling to distinctions of noble and base between ruler and subject, or cast aside good and evil in matters of honor and disgrace? Why should I pity myself to avoid wrongdoing or seek goodness from others? With such emptiness of mind, one may perhaps accord with the principle.

[3] *Annotation:* Accord with the heavenly principle, extend one’s inherent nature and trust in fate, proceeding with the straightforwardness of an infant.
*Exegesis:* *Rán* means "thus." A child is an infant. If, as described above, one extends principle and advances directly, acting like an infant, people will call one a child. This concludes the prior meaning, hence "this is what it means to follow Heaven as one’s companion."

[4] *Exegesis:* As for bending one’s form outwardly and conforming to the world, this is to take human relationships as one’s companions. Raising the hands, kneeling, bowing deeply, and lowering the body in submission—these are the rites of a minister. Yet blending with the dust, adapting to rise and fall with things, everyone does this, so how could I alone refuse? To do what others do is to incur no resentment from them.

The *Shuowen* states: "long kneeling." *Qūquán* is read as *quán*. *Wúcī* is read as *cáisī*.

**[5] *Commentary:*** To bend one’s form outwardly is to follow what human affairs demand.
*Exegesis:* This concludes the preceding [passage].

**[6] *Commentary:*** To perfect the present while emulating the ancients.
*Exegesis:* The duty of loyal remonstrance is perfected in the present, while the principle of ruler and minister is compared to the ancients above. Thus, it is akin to the loyal ministers of antiquity, such as Bi Gan—this is its meaning.

**[7] *Commentary:*** Though it appears as ordinary instruction, it truly carries a tone of admonishment.
*Exegesis:* *Zhé* means "to reproach." The words presented, though they appear as instruction, in their intent and purport truly contain a heart of admonishment.
*Phonetic Gloss:* *Zhé* is read as *zhígé*. *Fèngzé* is read as *fēifèng*.

**[8] *Exegesis:*** From ancient times onward, there has been such loyal remonstrance—it is not that I alone today have arisen to offer admonition.

**[9] *Commentary:*** By lodging forthrightness in antiquity, none can find fault with me.
*Exegesis:* If the Way of loyal remonstrance has existed since antiquity, then my present sincerity and forthrightness may also fortunately incur no trouble.

**[10] *Exegesis:*** This concludes the preceding.

**[11] *Exegesis:*** Having presented these three points, is it acceptable or not?

Confucius said: "Alas! How could it be so!"

"Excessive governance, though lawful, lacks coherence—even if steadfast, it remains blameless. Yet this is all it amounts to; how could it ever reach transformation? It is still the way of the self-willed."

*[1] Commentary:* To adhere to a single principle without deviation, yet impose three measures to govern, is to fail in harmony with affairs.
*Exegesis:* "Coherence" means order, appropriateness. If a law is properly ordered, it need not be multifarious; to establish three measures in governance is grossly cumbersome. If it is not appropriate to principle, it cannot bring tranquility—how then could it be acceptable?

*[2] Commentary:* Though not grand, it at least avoids censure.
*Exegesis:* To institute these three measures, though crude, since they have not been implemented, may fortunately incur no blame.

*[3] Commentary:* Blame may be absent, but transformation is not.
*Exegesis:* "How" means "why." When Yan Hui transformed Wei, he had only this method—enough for self-cultivation, but insufficient to save the age. How could it ever reach transformation? Alternate interpretation: To halt and not act may accord with principle, but to proceed to Wei would surely court peril.

*[4] Commentary:* To wield three techniques in approaching others is not to be without intention, entrusting it to the world.
*Exegesis:* The sage empties himself, responding to the moment without intention, like a bright mirror or an empty valley. Now Yan Hui precomposes teachings, deliberating over what may or may not be done—far from the state of forgetfulness, this is clearly the way of the self-willed.

Yan Hui said, "I have no means to advance further. May I ask the method?"

*Exegesis:* Yan Hui’s three techniques were suddenly exhausted; the way to transform Wei had no further direction. He thus entreated his sage teacher, hoping to hear the wondrous method.

Confucius said, "Fast! I shall tell you. To act with intention—is it easy? Those who find it easy defy Heaven’s fitness."

*[1] Commentary:* To act with intention is truly not easy.
*Exegesis:* Yan Hui earnestly entreated; the Master explained the fasting of the mind. "If you can empty and forget, I will tell you. But to act with intention in seeking the profound Dao is truly not easy."

*[2] Commentary:* To regard effortful action as easy is to fail to see its fitness.
*Exegesis:* The *Erya* states, "Summer is called the luminous Heaven," referring to its expansive qi. To act with intention in practicing the Way and regard it as easy is, under the vast Heaven, to fail to see its fitness. It is unfitting to fast the mind with intention.

Yan Hui said, "My family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Is this fasting?"

*Exegesis:* "Eat" means to consume. "Meat" refers to pungent vegetables. "Fasting" means alignment—both mind and conduct unstained by worldly dust. Yan Hui’s poverty is well-documented in the Confucian and historical records: no wine to drink, no meat to eat, subsisting on simple fare for months. He asked if this constituted fasting.

Confucius said, "This is the fasting for sacrifices, not the fasting of the mind."

*Exegesis:* The Master replied: This is the fasting for offering to spirits and ancestors, the conventional method of preparation—it is not the fasting of the mind.

Yan Hui said, "May I ask about the fasting of the mind?"

*Exegesis:* Earlier, he spoke of poverty, implying the need for sacrificial rites. Now he sought the method of fasting the mind.

Confucius said, "Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Listening halts at the ears; the mind halts at signs. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."

*[1] Commentary:* To discard heterodoxy and embrace singularity.
*Exegesis:* Unify your will, abandoning all heterodoxy. In stillness and emptiness, forgetfulness, you will obscurely accord with solitary transformation.

Here the Master responds to Yan Hui, further expounding the art of the fasting of the mind.

*Exegesis:* In *qu yi* ("discarding heterodoxy"), *qu* is pronounced with the falling tone, as below.

*[2] Exegesis:* The ear’s root is empty and still, not clinging to tones and timbres. Turning inward to listen to silence, the spirit congeals in the mind’s signs.

*[3] Exegesis:* The mind possesses awareness, still giving rise to clinging and attachment; qi is without thought or deliberation, empty and yielding, bearing all things. Thus, discard that awareness and take up this emptiness and yielding. Shedding and shedding again, one gradually ascends to the mysterious and wondrous.

*[4] Exegesis:* Not clinging to sounds and dust, listening halts at the ear. This explains "do not listen with the ears."

*[5] Exegesis:* *Fu* means "to join." When the mind arises in clinging and deliberation, it must join with external conditions. Only in stillness and emptiness does it no longer correspond with external conditions. This explains "do not listen with the mind."

*[6] Commentary:* Abandoning the ears and eyes, discarding the mind’s intentions, one accords with the self-attainment of qi’s nature—this is emptiness awaiting things.

*Exegesis:* Like qi, soft and weak, empty and open, the mind is still and forgetful, only then able to respond to things. This explains "listen with qi."

◎ Yu Yue said: The above states, "Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with qi." Here, "listening halts at the ears" should read "the ears halt at listening," an error in transmission. This further explains the meaning of "do not listen with the ears": the ear’s function halts at listening alone, hence "do not listen with the ears." "The mind halts at signs" further explains "do not listen with the mind": the mind’s function halts at joining with things alone, hence "do not listen with the mind." *Fu* means "to join," that is, to join with things. Joining with things is not the same as "emptiness awaiting things." "Qi is that which is empty and awaits things" further explains the term *qi*, clarifying that one should listen with qi. Guo’s commentary—"abandoning the ears and eyes, discarding the mind’s intentions"—mistakenly reads *fu* and *qi* as a single phrase, not only losing the meaning but also failing to form a proper sentence.

*[7] Commentary:* Empty the mind, and the supreme Dao will gather within.

*Exegesis:* Only this true Dao gathers in the empty mind. Thus, one whose mind is empty embodies the fasting of the mind, the wondrous Dao.

*Textual Note:* The characters *zhe hu* (者乎) in note [1] are deleted following the Shide Tang edition. The character *yi* (遣) in note [6] is emended to *yi* (遗) following the Shide Tang edition and *Zhuzi Pingyi*.

Yan Hui said, "Before I received this teaching, I was truly myself. Having received it, I am no longer myself—can this be called emptiness?"

*[1] Commentary:* Not yet employing the fasting of the mind, he still possessed his self.

*Exegesis:* Before receiving the teaching of the fasting of the mind, he still harbored an obstructed mind. Unable to break his body and forget himself, he was still truly Yan Hui.

*Exegesis:* *Wei shi de shi* ("Before I received this teaching") is a complete sentence. Cui reads it as ending at *shi* ("truly").

*[2] Commentary:* Having received the fasting of the mind, he no longer possessed his self.

*Exegesis:* After receiving the Master’s teaching, employing the fasting of the mind, he was able to utterly forget self and other. There was no longer any "Yan Hui" to be had.

The Master said, "It is complete. Let me tell you! If you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by its fame, then when you enter, you may speak; if not, remain silent. Without gate, without governance, abiding in a single dwelling and lodging in the inevitable—then you are close indeed.

*[1] Exegesis:* The Master’s earlier explanation of the fasting of the mind reaches its perfection here.

*[2] Commentary:* In the realm where the mind is released and self-attained, one should rest in reality.

*Exegesis:* The Master instructs Yan Hui on the essentials of transforming Wei, cautioning him not to grasp its pivotal points. Rather, he should wander within its bounds, concealing his traces and silencing his voice, not allowing fame or wisdom to move others. *Fan* means "bounds."

*[3] Commentary:* Like tones in harmony, one responds without intention, hence it is called "speaking." Responding without intention means following others, not forcing a response.

*Exegesis:* If his Dao were to become familiar to the Lord of Wei, he could speak to correct and save him. If his remonstrance were not heeded, he should seal his lips and forget his words. To forcibly display loyalty and integrity would surely invite disaster.

*Exegesis:* *Bu qiang* ("not forcing") is pronounced *qi zhang*.

*[4] Commentary:* Letting things be as they are is "without gate"; entrusting the world to its own peace is "without governance." *Du* means "to govern."

*Exegesis:* *Du* means "to govern." Like water or a mirror, responding with an empty mind, one does not act in advance.

*Exegesis:* *Wu du* is read in its standard sense, meaning "to govern." Cui’s edition reads *mei* ("greedy").

◎ Jia Shifu said: The *Shuowen* defines *du* as "thick." Laozi says, "Let it be thickened." "Without gate" means entering without discerning its direction; "without governance" means wandering without clinging to its traces. Responding to the natural accord, one can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by its fame.

◎ Li Zhen said: *Men* ("gate") and *du* ("governance") are parallel terms, but *du* and *men* are not of the same category. The *Shuowen* defines *du* as "thick." Harmful plants often grow thickly, but this meaning does not fit here. *Du* is a loan for *dao* (壔). Under *dao*, the *Shuowen* states: "to protect," also "a high mound," read like *du*. This aligns with the commentary’s "self-attainment." Zhang Xingfu’s *Shuowen Fayi* says: *Dao* refers to piling earth into a platform to transmit signals, as in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, which speaks of "making a high *bao* to pray on the royal road, placing a drum upon it so that those far and near may hear." *Bao* is a corruption of *dao*. *Dao* is a place of protection and defense, hence its meaning is borrowed for "protection."

The *Yijing*, *Zhuangzi*, and *Laozi* all use the character *du* in precisely this sense—*Laozi*’s “the *du* of the pavilion,” *Zhouyi*’s “with this *du* the world is governed and the people follow”—all instances of loan usage. Hence the *Guangya*’s gloss: “*du* means ‘to secure.’” Now, *dao* (壔) is the original graph for *du*, and it properly belongs to the same category as *men* (“gate”), which is why *men* and *du* form a parallel construction. Pronounced *du hao*, it represents a phonetic shift.

【五】【注】“Inevitable” refers to what is necessarily so in principle, to dwelling in the abode of perfect oneness and meeting the tally of necessity.

【疏】*Zhai* means “dwelling.” To dwell in the Way of perfect oneness is to respond without choice, the meeting of stimulus and response in dark accord, not by premeditation.

【释文】*Er yu*: Cui’s edition reads *ru yu*.

【六】【注】Principle is exhausted in this.

【疏】*Ji* means “exhausted.” The principle of responding to things is exhausted in this.

To leave no trace is easy; to walk without treading the earth is hard. To be used by others is easy if one feigns; to be used by Heaven is hard if one feigns. We have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; we have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge.

Behold that emptiness: from the empty chamber, whiteness arises; auspiciousness comes to rest where it rests. If one does not come to rest, this is called “sitting in motion.” If one follows the ears and eyes, turning inward in communication yet remaining external to the mind’s knowing, then ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men! This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those who are scattered!

【一】【注】Not acting is easy; to act without treading the earth is impossible. Non-action is easy; to act without harming one’s nature is unattainable.

【疏】To remain still and leave no trace is not difficult in principle; to walk without treading the earth is thus impossible. Just as non-action and emptiness make response easy, so action and thought make engagement with things difficult. The principle is necessarily so, hence this analogy.

【释文】*Jue ji yi wu*: Punctuated as a complete phrase. Xiang and Cui both attach *wu* to the following sentence. ◎Lu Wenchang says: This reading is gravely mistaken. Why not follow the commentary?

【二】【注】What is obtained through seeing and hearing is coarse, hence easy to deceive. As for the subtle recompense of nature, it is hard to feign. The less one loses of reality, the less incomplete one is; the more one loses of reality, the more incomplete one is. The recompense for loss and gain has never failed to match its measure. To go against Heaven and feign—is this not difficult?

【疏】Human sentiment and its governance are crude and shallow, hence easy to deceive. The natural order’s control is subtle and fine, thus hard to falsify. Therefore, in human affairs and engagement with things, one must follow one’s nature and act with authenticity.

【释文】*Zhe cu*: Pronounced *cu*.

【三】【注】Every affair requires its instruments; without the abode of perfect emptiness, there can be no reality of transforming things.

【疏】A bird without six pinions cannot soar through the void; a person without knowledge cannot engage with things.

【释文】*You zhi zhi zhe*: The first *zhi* is pronounced *zhi* (wisdom); the second is read as written. The same applies to the following sentence.

【四】【注】To see as if there were nothing is to have an empty chamber. From the empty chamber, pure whiteness alone arises.

【疏】*Zhan* means “to contemplate.” *Bi* means “the object before one.” *Que* means “empty.” Contemplating the myriad existents, all are empty and still. Thus one empties the chamber of the mind, illuminates the true source, and wisdom and clarity arise in accord with function. *Bai* is the Dao.

【释文】*Que zhe*: Xu pronounces it *ku xue*. Sima: “empty.” *Xu shi sheng bai*: Cui: “*Bai* is the light of the sun.” Sima: “The chamber is a metaphor for the mind; if the mind can be empty, then pure whiteness arises alone.”

【五】【注】Auspiciousness gathers where there is perfect emptiness and stillness.

【疏】*Ji* refers to felicitous events; *xiang* to auspicious omens. *Zhi* means “stillness” or “concentration.” Auspiciousness and felicity come to rest in a concentrated and still mind, which can also bring forth auspicious and felicitous responses. ◎Yu Yue says: The repetition of *zhi* is meaningless. The *Chuzhen* chapter of the *Huainanzi* reads: “From the empty chamber, whiteness arises; auspiciousness comes to rest.” It is likely that the second *zhi* here is a corruption of *ye* (“also”). Lu Chongyuan’s commentary on the *Liezi*’s *Tianrui* chapter says: “From the empty chamber, whiteness arises; auspiciousness comes to rest,” which also demonstrates the error of repeating *zhi*.

【六】【注】If one does not come to rest where one should, failing to meet the ultimate, this is to respond while sitting yet gallop without cease. Thus, before external enemies arrive, one is already internally exhausted—how can one transform things?

【疏】If one cannot make one’s form like withered wood and one’s mind like dead ashes, then even if one’s demeanor is upright and composed, one’s spirit gallops—this is called “sitting in form yet galloping in mind.”

【七】【注】If one closes the ears and eyes yet naturally attains, the mind’s knowing is externalized. Thus, to follow one’s nature and communicate directly, going nowhere without darkness—there is no blame even in the obscure, how much less the burdens of the human world!

【疏】*Xun* means “to employ.” If one can make the senses communicate inwardly without relying on external objects, and the spirit is at peace, forgetting the mind’s knowing, then one casts off the body externally and forgets knowledge internally. Thus, one breaks the form and dismisses the senses, empties the mind and follows things—ghosts and spirits will darkly adhere and dwell. Is this not fitting!

Human relationships turn to reverence and take refuge—this is indeed fitting. Thus, the Outer Chapters say: "There is no blame from ghosts, nor fault from men."

【Exegesis】*Xun* (徇) is read *cí jùn* in *Shiwen*; Xu reads it *cí lún*. Li explains: "to employ." *Xin zhi* (心知) is pronounced *zhì*, with the same pronunciation in the commentary.

【Eight】【Commentary】It is said that among things, none are noble or base—none fail to rely on the mind’s knowing and the ears’ and eyes’ perception to communicate. Thus, what the world calls "knowing"—does one know because one desires to know? What it calls "seeing"—does one see because one desires to see? If knowing and seeing could be obtained merely by desire, then could one desire worthiness and obtain worthiness, or strive for sagehood and attain sagehood? Certainly not. Yet the world does not understand that knowing knows of itself; instead, it desires to *be* knowing in order to know. It does not see that seeing sees of itself; instead, it desires to *be* seeing in order to see. It does not know that life lives of itself; instead, it strives to *be* life in order to live. Thus, upon seeing the eyes, one seeks the clarity of Li Zhu; upon seeing the ears, one demands the acuity of Shi Kuang. The spirit gallops within, the ears and eyes are exhausted without, the body is ill at ease, and one fails to merge with things. Failing to merge, how can one harmonize with the changes of the human world or respond to the rhythms of generation after generation? It has never been so.

【Exegesis】*Shi* (是) is a term of direct reference, pointing here to the prior methods of "fasting of the mind" and the like, which create and transform the myriad things and nurture all living beings. "Taming the ox and riding the horse" refers to Fuxi, surnamed Feng, also called Tai Hao. *Ji Qu* refers to the sovereigns before the Three August Ones, who ruled without writing. This Way of fasting the mind served as the guiding principle for Yu of Xia and Shun of Yu in responding to things. Fuxi and Ji Qu practiced it throughout their lives—how much more should ordinary, coarse, and careless people follow this path if they wish to transform things!

【Exegesis】*Suo niu* (所纽): Xu reads *nǚ jiǔ*; Cui explains: "to bind and enact." Jianwen says: "the root." *Fuxi* (伏戏): also written as *Xī* (羲) or *Xī* (牺), pronounced *xǔ yí*; he is Tai Hao, the first of the Three August Ones. *Ji Qu* (几蘧): pronounced *qí jū*; Xiang explains: "an ancient emperor." Li explains: "an emperor of high antiquity." *San yan* (散焉): pronounced *xī dàn*; Li explains: "to let go." Cui explains: "those whose virtue does not reach the sage-kings are called *san*." *Zhi cong* (之聪): one version writes *ting* (听). *Jie sang* (竭丧): pronounced *xī làng*.

【Collation】(1) The characters *xū shì* (虚室) are reversed in Zhao Jianyi’s edition. (2) The character *wei* (为) is written as *wei* (谓) in the Shidetang edition; Zhao’s edition also writes *wei* (为). (3) The characters *wei er* (为而) are reversed in the Shidetang edition.

---

Duke Ye of She was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi. He asked Confucius, saying: "The king’s charge to me, Zhu Liang, is most weighty. Qi’s treatment of envoys is likely to be respectful but not urgent. Even a common man cannot be moved—how much less a feudal lord! I tremble at the thought. You once told me: ‘In matters great or small, few fail to achieve success through the Dao and find joy in it. If the matter does not succeed, there will inevitably be the calamity of human judgment; if it succeeds, there will inevitably be the calamity of yin and yang. Only one of power can ensure that neither success nor failure brings harm.’ I eat coarse food and do not seek refinement; my cook has no desire for coolness. Yet this morning I received the command, and by evening I am drinking ice—am I not inwardly burning? I have not yet reached the truth of the matter, yet I already suffer the calamity of yin and yang. If the matter does not succeed, I will surely face the calamity of human judgment. These two outcomes—no minister can bear them. You must have something to tell me!"

【One】【Commentary】The weight of the mission indicates a request.

【Exegesis】Yin Chengzi, named Zhu Liang and styled Zigao, was a great-grandson of King Zhuang of Chu. He held a fief in She and usurped the title of duke. The "king" refers to the ruler of Chu, who in the Spring and Autumn period was actually a viscount but usurped the title of king. Qi was the descendant of the Grand Duke of the Jiang clan. Their ancestor was one of the Four Mountains of Yu; some were enfeoffed at Lü, hence the Grand Duke was also called Lü Wang. King Wu of Zhou enfeoffed the Grand Duke at Yingqiu, establishing the state of Qi. The states of Qi and Chu maintained friendly relations, exchanging envoys with jade and silk without cease. Sometimes they sought aid in times of crisis, or requested troops to punish wrongdoing—such matters were not trivial, and the trust placed in them was great. Thus, Zhu Liang was anxious and sought guidance from Confucius.

【Exegesis】*Ye Gong* (叶公): pronounced *shè*. *Zigao* (子高): a grandee of Chu, magistrate of She County, who usurped the title of duke. Surnamed Shen, named Zhu Liang, styled Zigao. *Jiang shi* (将使): pronounced *suǒ lì*; the same pronunciation applies to *dai shi* (待使) in the commentary.

【2】【Annotation】Fearing that Qi might merely offer empty courtesies in return for respect, yet refuse to urgently respond to its requests.
【Exegesis】Though the Marquis of Qi maintained frequent exchanges, his heart lacked sincerity. When receiving and entertaining Chu’s envoys, he was outwardly diligent, yet the matters they requested remained unresolved or ungranted. Given the weight of the entrusted mission, such concerns were foreseen.

【3】【Exegesis】Even the petty ambitions of a common man cannot be swayed—how much less those of the five ranks of nobility! Judging by this, Zhu Liang’s anxiety was profound.
【Exegesis (variant reading)】*Li zhi* (栗之): pronounced *lì*. Li [Yun] says: "to fear."

【4】【Annotation】For matters great or small, even the slightest failure to communicate may prevent the fulfillment of amity.
This was what Confucius once told Zhu Liang.
【Exegesis】*Zi* (子) refers to Confucius. *Gua* (寡) means "few." The threads of affairs are manifold, and though their scale may differ, none fail to find joy in their completion. Thus, Zhu Liang recalled what he had previously been taught, applying it to address the present situation.
【Exegesis (variant reading)】*Chang yu* (常语): pronounced *yú jù*. The same below.

◎ Lu Wenchang says: In the present text, 常 is consistently written as 尝.

【5】【Annotation】For what brings joy in its completion, failure brings anger.
This is something even the King of Chu could not avoid.
【Exegesis】If emotions are at odds and affairs do not reach fruition, then one faces the principles of human relations and the anxieties of punishment.

【6】【Annotation】Though the immediate distress may pass, joy and fear still wage war in the breast, having already congealed like ice in the five viscera.
【Exegesis】Joy expands the yang; sorrow darkens the yin.
When affairs reach completion and the heart’s feelings are fully satisfied, former sorrow transforms into present joy.
Yet joy and fear intermingle in a single heart, yin and yang violently contend in the five viscera, and ice coalesces—what else is this if not distress?
Thus, the following text states.
【Exegesis (variant reading)】*Cang yi* (藏矣): pronounced *cái làng*.

【7】【Annotation】To entrust success or failure to others without allowing it to trouble the heart—only one of great virtue can do this!
【Exegesis】How can one remain unmoved in the spirit by gain or loss, entrusting success or failure to the path ahead, and not be burdened by sorrow or joy? Only one of abundant virtue!

【8】【Annotation】Facing the fire without seeking coolness reveals the frugality of the meal.
【Exegesis】*Zang* (臧) means "good." *Qing* (清) means "cool."
Bound by solemn duty and filled with dread, he partook of coarse fare without time for refined delicacies.
Since the meal was so frugal, the cook did not wish to seek coolness; the fire burned low, offering no heat to escape.
【Exegesis (variant reading)】*Zhi* (执): All editions concur.
Jianwen reads it as *re* (热).
*Cu* (粗): pronounced *cū*, or *cái gǔ* in another reading.
*Er bu zang* (而不臧): pronounced *láng*, meaning "good." Ends the sentence.
Another reading: *cái láng*, extending the sentence to the character *cuan* (爨).
*Cuan* (爨): pronounced *qī luàn*.
*Wu yu qing* (无欲清): pronounced *qī xìng*, with the character preferably written as 从 (a loan character).
*Cong* (从) is a loan for *qing* (凊), meaning "cool."
*Zhi ren* (之人): Refers to the cook tending the fire for food without seeking coolness, showing the fire was small and the meal appropriately frugal.
*Suo zhuan* (所馔): pronounced *shì liàn*.

【9】【Annotation】That the meal was frugal yet he drank ice internally reveals his genuine anxiety over the difficulty of the matter, not a desire for fine food.
【Exegesis】Zhu Liang received the decree at dawn and drank ice by dusk, fully demonstrating his dread, sorrow, and inner turmoil.
His earnest inquiry into the Dao and his penetrating insight into this state of mind are evident.
【Exegesis (variant reading)】*Nei re yu* (内热与): pronounced *yú*. Below, *shen yu* (慎与) is the same.
Xiang says: "One who eats fine food must have internal heat."

【10】【Annotation】Before affairs are settled, one only fears they will not succeed.
If they truly fail, then fear congeals within while the net of punishment looms without.
【Exegesis】When the outcome of a matter remains undecided and success or failure is unknown, yet sorrow and joy linger in the heart, this is the affliction of yin and yang.
If affairs go awry and fail to reach fruition, then the principles of ministerial duty and the net of punishment will ensnare one.
Facing these two calamities, where can one escape blame?
【Exegesis (variant reading)】*Ze kong ju* (则恐惧): pronounced *qiū yǒng*.

【11】【Exegesis】To be unworthy as a minister and yet occupy a lowly post, holding high rank while lacking virtue—one is unfit for the task.
You, Master, are a sage whose heart encompasses the benefit of all things; you must have a reason—pray, enlighten me!
【Exegesis (variant reading)】*Yi ren* (以任): pronounced *ér lín*, or *ér zhèn* in another reading.

【Textual Note】(1) *Que wu* cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript, where this sentence reads: "少有不道以成欢."

Confucius said: "There are two great precepts in the world: the first is fate; the second is duty.
Your love for your parents is fate, which cannot be untied from the heart.
A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is no place where the lord is not, no escape from him within heaven and earth.
These are called the great precepts.
Thus, one who serves his parents finds peace in any circumstance—this is the perfection of filial piety.
One who serves his lord finds peace in any task—this is the height of loyalty.
One who serves his own heart does not allow sorrow or joy to alter what lies before him, knowing the inevitable and accepting it as fate—this is the perfection of virtue.
For a minister or child, there are indeed things one cannot avoid.
Acting with the true feelings of the matter while forgetting oneself—how could there be leisure to delight in life and hate death?
You, Master, may proceed thus!"

【1】【Exegesis】*Jie* (戒) means "precept."
Within the realm, teachings and precepts are myriad, but in essence, none surpass these two matters.
The meaning of these two is elaborated below.

【2】【Annotation】It is naturally bound and cannot be untied.
【Exegesis】The filial child serves his parents with utmost love and respect.
This nature and fate arise spontaneously, following the heart’s truth—thus, it cannot be untied.

【3】【Annotation】When a thousand gather, if none is taken as master, disorder leads to dispersion.
Thus, many worthy men cannot mean many lords; without worthies, there cannot be no lord—this is the Dao of heaven and humanity, an inevitable principle.
【Exegesis】The relationship between lord and minister is inherently fixed.
Thus, the loyal minister serves his lord and dies to fulfill his integrity—this is a matter of duty aligning, not innate nature.
Yet though the six directions are vast, there is no lordless state; if one incurs blame, where can one escape?
Thus, one obeys the command and acts without hesitation.

【4】【Annotation】If the lord could be escaped and parents untied, they would not be worthy of precepts.
【Exegesis】The meaning of the great precepts regarding lord and parents is thus established.

【5】【Exegesis】The filial child nourishes his parents with the aim of compliance and comfort.
Whether in high or low office, he seeks emolument without choosing rank, finding peace in whatever he encounters—only then is he called perfectly filial.

【6】【Exegesis】In observing ritual toward kin and serving one’s lord, the will must be wholly loyal and steadfast. Whether the task be smooth or perilous, one accepts it as fate—how can one pick and choose based on profit or harm before carrying it out? One who can do so embodies the loftiest excellence of the loyal minister.

【7】【Annotation】To know that what cannot be altered is fate and to accept it is to be free of sorrow and joy—how could one then be swayed by ease or adversity? Thus, one darkly takes whatever comes as fate, without applying the heart to weigh it; one merges utterly with what is most fitting, without joy or sorrow intervening. Even in serving ordinary men, one finds nowhere that is not fitting—how much more so with one’s lord and kin!

【Exegesis】The follower of the Dao who settles his heart and mind perceives no difference between compliance and defiance, grasps that gain and loss are one. Thus, he traverses the realm of sorrow and joy without lightly yielding to either, knowing that success and failure are inevitable—how could mere human sentiment control them? Therefore, he rests his heart in accord with fate, never deviating from the heavenly principle. Unless one is a perfected person of profound virtue, who could attain this?

【Textual Note】*Āilè* (sorrow and joy) is read as *luò*. The same applies below. *Shīhū* (ease or adversity) is read according to its standard pronunciation.

Cui reads *chǐ* as *yí*, glossing it as "to shift." ◎ Qingfan’s note: *Shī* is read as *yí*; *bù yì shī* means "not shifting." In the *Outer Chapters of the Annals of Yanzi*, it appears as *jūn chén yì shī*; in the "Efficacy of the Ru" chapter of the *Xunzi*, as *āi xū zhī xiāng shī yì zhī*; and in the *Book of Han*, "Biography of Wei Wan," as *rén zhī suǒ shī yì*—all instances where *shī* is read as *yí*. When stated directly, it is *yì shī*; when inverted, it becomes *shī yì*. (Originally from Wang Niansun’s *Reading Notes*.)

【8】
【Annotation】Matters have their inevitable outcomes, and principles are inherently constant. Thus, entrusting them ensures success, and where matters succeed, the self is never lost—why then expend thought on one’s own person?

【Exegesis】When a subject or child serves their lord or father, they must devote their life and exhaust their sincerity. When duty calls, they act without hesitation or selection, forgetting themselves to rectify affairs—this is only fitting. If the matter cannot be halted, one must submit to fate.

【9】
【Annotation】Principles are never obstructed; thus, one should accept what is encountered and advance directly. If one’s commitment to the Dao is not steadfast and likes or dislikes linger in the heart, unable to proceed with the ultimate rightness while scheming for life or fearing death, I have never seen such a one succeed in their affairs.

【Exegesis】Since one is a messenger, there is no room for likes or dislikes. In serving the lord’s command, one must simply proceed to Qi—what leisure is there to scheme for life or fear death?

【Textual Note】*Ér wù* is read as *wù lù*; the same applies below.

Qiu respectfully presents again what he has heard: In near relations, one must yield in trust; in distant ones, one must be loyal in speech. Speech must sometimes be transmitted. Transmitting words of twofold joy or twofold anger is the most difficult task under heaven. Where there is twofold joy, there will surely be excess in praise; where there is twofold anger, there will surely be excess in blame. All excess is falsehood; where there is falsehood, trust is absent; where trust is absent, the transmitter of words incurs misfortune. Thus, the legalist maxim states: "Transmit the constant sentiments, do not transmit excess words, and you will be nearly preserved whole."

【1】
【Annotation】Those who are near can interact directly, so they yield and submit through the verification of trust.

【Textual Note】*Fù yǐ* is read as *fú yòu*; the same applies in the annotation below.

【2】
【Annotation】From afar, intent is conveyed through words.

【Exegesis】In all near associations, one yields in trust; in distant ones, one expresses loyalty through words. Here, Confucius cites what he has heard to admonish Zhu Liang.

【Textual Note】*Chuán yì* is read as *zhàng zhuān*; the same applies throughout the text and annotations.

【3】
【Annotation】Now, words of joy and anger, if they exceed reality, should be transmitted in such a way that neither side loses the mean—thus, this is no easy task.

【Exegesis】When conveying intent through words, one may employ a messenger, and as both parties engage, their emotions of joy or anger fluctuate. To serve as such an intermediary among people is not easily done.

【Textual Note】*Liǎng nù* is read in its standard pronunciation; the annotation follows the same. Alternately written as *yuàn* ("resentment"). The same applies below. *Wèi yì* is read as *wèi chǐ*; the same applies throughout the text and annotations.

【4】
【Annotation】*Yì* means excess. Words of joy and anger often surpass what is appropriate.

【Exegesis】*Yì* means excess. When two people exchange words of joy or anger, if they follow their emotions, their praise or censure will invariably exceed what is fitting.

【5】
【Annotation】There is suspicion that the words are not truly theirs, as if the transmitter fabricated them.

【Exegesis】*Lèi* means resemblance. Words that exceed what is fitting lack true substance; when the listener doubts them, it seems as though the messenger has falsely constructed them.

【6】
【Annotation】This gives rise to doubt.

【Exegesis】*Mò* describes the appearance of doubt. Once it seems the transmitter has fabricated the words, disbelief arises, and doubt takes hold.

【7】
【Annotation】If one transmits excessive words, it appears reckless and false. When the recipient harbors doubt, the transmitter is arbitrarily blamed for misrepresenting the weight of the matter.

【Exegesis】When the recipient grows doubtful and withholds trust, the messenger who conveys the words incurs misfortune as a result.

【8】
【Annotation】Though one may hear momentary excessive words, they should not be transmitted. Instead, one must weigh their constant sentiments and ensure their sincerity, thus nearing preservation.

【Exegesis】To navigate human affairs as an intermediary is truly difficult. One must carefully observe enduring dispositions and ensure that both parties reach a balanced understanding. One must not transmit fleeting emotions of joy or anger, which render both sides’ words difficult to fathom. Those who act thus come close to preserving themselves whole. The Master cites the maxims of former sages as a model for future generations.

【Exegesis on the Text】
*《而要》* is read as *yāo* (遥, distant) in reverse.
*《则近》* refers to *jìn* (附近, nearness).

【Collation】
(1) Zhao the Remonstrator’s edition reads *wàngdàn* (妄诞, reckless fabrication).

Moreover, those who contend with cunning and force begin in brightness (1) but invariably end in darkness (2). When excess (3) reaches its height, myriad stratagems arise (4). Those who drink wine with ritual propriety begin in order (5) but invariably end in disorder (6). When excess reaches its height, myriad extravagances arise (7). All affairs follow this pattern: they begin in trustworthiness but end in baseness; their inception is simple, yet their conclusion must grow vast (8).

(1)【Annotation】Originally, both parties delight in play.
【Exegesis on the Text】*《共好》* is read as *hūbào* (呼报, mutual delight).

(2)【Annotation】When the desire to prevail arises, harm toward the other secretly stirs.
【Exegesis】Brightness (*yáng*) is joy; darkness (*yīn*) is anger. When testing strength in play, there is no lack of cleverness. At first, jesting brings joy; by the end, however, hearts generate resentment, and the desire to prevail subtly resembles mutual harm. In the world, joy and anger transform in this manner—this example of contending in strength serves as an analogy.
◎ Jia Shifu remarks: What is manifest is called *yáng*; what is concealed is called *yīn*. Those who contend in cunning must employ many *yīn* schemes, exhausting the use of their minds to seek victory over one another.

(3)【Annotation】They no longer follow principle.
【Exegesis】When resentment and the desire to prevail reach their extreme, emotions overflow with strange deceits and a hundred wiles.
【Exegesis on the Text】*《大至》* is pronounced *tài* (泰), with some editions reading *tài*. Xu Chizuo reads it as *chìzuǒ*. The same applies below.
*《奇巧》* is read as *qíqiǎo* (as written) or *kěxiào* (crafty).

(4)【Annotation】Distinctions of rank are observed; toasts proceed in proper sequence.
【Exegesis on the Text】*《乎治》* is read as *zhílì* (直吏, orderly governance).
*《有别》* is read as *bǐliè* (彼列, distinctions).

(5)【Annotation】They become steeped in excess and intoxication.
【Exegesis】Order (*zhì*) is principle. When host and guest exchange toasts, there is an inherent pattern. After the caps are askew (9), distinctions of rank vanish. What begins in order invariably ends in disorder—all things follow this course. This example of drinking wine serves as an analogy.
【Exegesis on the Text】*《湛》* is read as *zhílín* (直林) or *dánán* (答南).
*《湎》* is read as *miǎnshàn* (面善).
*《淫液》* is read as *yǐnzhī* (以只).

(6)【Annotation】They indulge in dissipation, unrestrained in every direction.
【Exegesis】Once the feast reaches its height, excess and intoxication grow extreme. Songs and dances follow one after another without restraint or decorum; myriad strange extravagances arise, and joy knows no bounds.

(7)【Annotation】Trouble arises from simplicity; affairs begin in subtlety—this is an inevitable tendency.
【Exegesis】All human affairs follow this pattern: they invariably begin in sincerity and end in baseness; they start small but must grow vast. Thus, trouble arises from simplicity, and affairs begin in subtlety. This is the combined analogy.
◎ Yu Yue remarks: *Liàng* (谅, trustworthiness) and *bǐ* (鄙, baseness) do not form a parallel. The preceding text states, “begin in brightness (*yáng*) but invariably end in darkness (*yīn*),” and “begin in order but invariably end in disorder”—*yīn* and *yáng*, order and disorder, are parallel. Yet *liàng* and *bǐ* are not. I suspect *liàng* is a corruption of *zhū* (诸), which should be read as *dū* (都, grandeur). The *Erya*’s *Exegesis on Geography* notes that Song has *Mèngzhū*, while the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Annals of Xia* writes it as *Míngdū*—this is an example. Thus, “begin in grandeur but invariably end in baseness” (*dū* and *bǐ* form a proper parallel). The character was originally written as *zhū*, then corrupted to *liàng*, losing its original meaning. The *Huainanzi*’s *Exegesis on Words* states, “Thus, what begins in grandeur invariably grows greater than baseness,” citing the *Zhuangzi* as its source. This can be used to correct the text. The character *dà* (大) in that passage is a corruption of *zú* (卒), as explained in Wang Niansun’s *Reading Notes*.

【Collation】
(1) *Tài* (泰) follows the Shide Hall edition and Lu’s collation.
(2) The Shide Hall edition omits *zhě yě* (者也).
(3) *Cèbiàn* (侧弁) follows Liu Wendian’s corrected edition.
(4) The Shide Hall edition reads *liú* (流) for *huāng* (荒).

(1) Words are like wind and waves; actions are like the loss of substance (1).
(2) Wind and waves are easily stirred; the loss of substance is easily imperiled.
Thus, anger arises without cause, and artful speech with biased words (3). When beasts die, they do not choose their cries; their breath comes in ragged gasps, and in that moment, a murderous intent arises (4). When scrutiny reaches its extreme, there must be an unworthy heart to respond, though one does not realize it (5). If one does not realize it, who knows where it will end! (6)

Thus, the *Model Sayings* states: “Do not alter decrees (7); do not urge completion (8). Exceeding the proper measure is harmful (9).” Altering decrees and urging completion endanger affairs (10). What is beautifully completed endures (11); what is badly completed cannot be amended (12). Can one not be cautious! (13)

Moreover, riding things to roam the mind (14), entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection (15). What need is there to act in repayment! (16) It is better to deliver one’s mandate. This is the difficulty (17).

(1)【Annotation】Words are like wind and waves; thus, acting upon them leads to the loss of substance.
【Exegesis】Water stirs waves with the wind; the heart stirs joy and anger with words. Thus, acting upon these wind-and-wave-like words leads to the loss of true principle.
◎ Qing Fan notes: *Bō* (波, wave) should be read as *bō* (播, to scatter). Zheng’s commentary on the *Tribute of Yu* states: *Bō* means to scatter. *Bō* and *bō* are interchangeable in ancient script, meaning that wind scatters and thus easily stirs.

The phrase "wind-scattering" and "loss of substance" form a parallel construction, thus *bō* (波) cannot be glossed as "waves." (In the *Waiwu* chapter, Sima Bomin’s note reads: "wave-tossed ministers," where *bōdàng* (波荡) is synonymous with *bōdàng* 播荡, "scattering-tossing.") In the *Zuozhuan* for the twenty-third year of Duke Xi, "waves reaching the state of Jin" should also be read as *bō* (播), meaning "scattering to reach the state of Jin." (Originally cited in Wang Yinzhi’s *Jingyi Shuwen*.) In the *Tribute of Yu*, "The Ying and Bo [rivers] are dammed," the Ma, Zheng, and Wang editions all write *bō* (播) for *bō* (波), and the *Suoyin* glosses this as "overflowing in all directions." These all serve as evidence.

【*Shiwen*】*Shisang* (实丧) is read *xīlàng*.
The note and subsequent occurrences share this reading.
◎ Jia Shifu remarks: *Shisang* means "gain and loss." *Shi* (实) denotes what is possessed and preserved; *sang* (丧) denotes what is suddenly forgotten. To gain and lose unpredictably is the greatest peril in action, hence the warning of danger. Guo Xiang’s note—"acting upon them leads to the loss of substance; disregarding wind and waves and refraining from action preserves substance"—is likely in error.

【2】【Note】Thus, disregarding wind and waves and refraining from action preserves substance. When affairs accord with their true nature, danger can be stabilized and turmoil settled.

【Exegesis】Wind stirs water into waves, making it easily agitated—this illustrates how words lead to the loss of true principle and how peril arises effortlessly.

【3】【Note】The arising of anger has no other cause; it invariably stems from artful words exceeding reality or biased speech losing balance.

【Exegesis】The manifestation of anger has no other source; it always arises from the flattery of false, artful words or the bias of obsequious speech.

【*Shiwen*】*Piān cí* (偏辞) is read *piān*.
Cui’s edition writes *piǎn* (谝), read *biàn*.

【4】【Note】It is like a wild beast driven into a corner: when its cries grow desperate and its breath exhausted, harmonious sounds fail to arise, and its *qi* becomes disordered. Suddenly, it erupts in violent fury, and both parties develop flaws in their confrontation.

【Exegesis】When a wild beast is trapped in a dead end, its life imperiled, it cries without regard for sound, its breath pent-up and stifled. Its heart generates afflictions, and in a sudden burst of rage, it attacks and bites. This serves as an analogy.

【*Shiwen*】*Qì xī* (气息) are both read in their standard senses.

The earlier text originally had □*qì* (器), with the note: "□ is written as *xī* (息) in Ma’s edition. *Qì* (器) means *qì* (气)." Cui’s edition writes □□, with the note: "panting *qì* is unregulated." It also appears as the character *bì* (荜). ◎Qingfan’s note: *Shiwen* records that *qì* (气) in one version is written as *qì* (器). *Qì* (气) and *qì* (器) were interchangeable in ancient usage; *qì* (气) is the proper character, while *qì* (器) is the borrowed form. The *Da Dai Liji*’s "Wen Wang Guan Ren" chapter reads, "Its *qì* is broad and gentle," while the *Zhou Shu* writes *qì* (器) for *qì* (气)—this serves as evidence.

《*Fúrán*》 Xu reads *fú* (符弗) in reverse. Guo reads *fū* (敷末) in reverse. Li reads *fèi* (怫). Cui reads *bó* (勃).
《*Xīn lì*》 read as standard; Li reads *lài* (赖).
《*Cù zhī*》 read *zǐ liù* in reverse.
《□》 suspected to read *mài* in reverse, or *yì* (诣). Originally also written as *yóu* (疣), read *yóu* (尤).
《*Cī*》 read *shì mài* in reverse, or *qí jì* in reverse. If the above is written as *yóu* (疣), this is read *cái zhī* in reverse. ◎Lu Wenchang says: likely read the same as *yá zì* (睚眦).

【5】【Note】One who is broad and accommodating draws all things to him. If one is overly exacting and precise, a miserly and petty heart arises without one’s awareness. Thus, the great person lets things roam freely in the realm of self-attainment, neither resenting others’ abilities nor exhausting their joy. In this way, the bonds of the Four Seas may be preserved intact.

【Exegesis】When one is harsh and pressing, too severe in demands, an unwholesome heart suddenly responds of its own accord. Circumstances and feelings interact, and this is the natural principle of things. Thus, impatience loses one’s lordship, while magnanimity wins the multitude.

【*Shiwen*】《*Kè hé*》 read *xìng gé* in reverse.

【6】【Note】If one does not awaken to this, how can one know where fortune and misfortune equally lead?

【Exegesis】To be impatient and offend others is to invite rejection by principle; repeated self-summoning brings one to ignorance of the cause. If one responds to such situations with unworthiness, who will foresee the eventual calamity?

【*Shiwen*】《*Suǒ qí*》 read as standard, or *cái jì* in reverse. ◎Qingfan’s note: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Bao Mingyuan’s "Nigu" poem cites Sima as saying: "Who knows where misfortune ultimately ends?" (5)

【7】【Note】Convey the truth of the matter.

【Exegesis】Carry out the lord’s commands by transmitting their substance; one must not alter them on the spur of momentary joy or anger.

【8】【Note】Let it reach completion on its own.

【Exegesis】State the lord’s commands directly and let circumstances take their course; there is no need to urge or encourage, forcing them to completion.

【9】【Note】To add to it is not to act in accordance with reality.

【Exegesis】Abide by Heaven’s decree, follow one’s nature, and act in accord with feeling; there is no need to embellish with words, exceeding the original measure.

【10】【Note】This is a perilous course of action.

【Exegesis】Thus, to alter the lord’s commands and forcibly urge their completion is to court great peril in the matter at hand.

【11】【Note】What is beautifully completed follows the transformations of time. It is like planting: it cannot be achieved in a single morning.

【Exegesis】What the heart finds beautiful comes to fruition by following its inclination, not through urging or encouragement—thus it endures. ◎Jia Shifu says: What is beautiful endures in the Dao and only then transforms into completion; what is achieved in a day cannot be relied upon. What is base is completed in an instant and cannot be amended. The distinction between beauty and baseness is subtle, yet the difference in difficulty is manifest. Thus, to pursue beauty and shun baseness is the common inclination of people, yet circumstances often do not allow it; sometimes the opposite is applied, and one grows accustomed and at ease with it. The note’s intent seems disconnected.

【12】【Note】To urge and force completion of what one detests is to invite regret and failure in short order.

【Exegesis】What the heart detests, if forcibly urged to completion, will soon be undone and regretted.

【*Shiwen*】《*Suǒ wù*》 read *wū lù* in reverse.
《*Quàn*》 read *qí zhàng* in reverse. Below, *yù* is the same.

【13】【Exegesis】In traversing the human world and bearing a mission as an emissary, one should deeply heed the cautionary words of the former sages.

【14】【Note】Entrust one’s intent to things.

【Exegesis】The solitary transformer, mingling in the world of men, rides the presence of things to roam freely, moving with an empty heart to accord with the age—what peril could there be?

【15】【Note】To follow what is inevitably so in principle is to fully embody the mark of the Mean; this is the ultimate in engaging with things.

【Exegesis】What cannot be avoided is the inevitable in principle. To entrust oneself to what is inevitable and cultivate a heart of harmony and equilibrium—this is the ultimate attainment of true principle and the supreme subtlety in responding to things!

【16】【Note】One should simply act in accordance with the reality of what is reported—why interpose one’s own intentions on its behalf?

【Exegesis】Follow one’s own fate and act by extending principle—why preemptively devise restraints and contrive responses for it?

【*Shiwen*】《*Wéi wéi*》 the first read as standard, the second read *yú wěi* in reverse.

【17】【Note】To directly convey a command is easiest, yet to apply joy and anger in one’s heart makes it difficult.

【Exegesis】To directly convey one’s feelings and entrust oneself to fate is most simple and easy—how could it be difficult? That it is said to be difficult means it is not difficult.

Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei. He asked Qu Boyu, saying: “There is a man here whose virtue is as destructive as Heaven’s killing. If I deal with him without method, it will endanger our state; if I deal with him with method, it will endanger myself. His knowledge is just enough to perceive others’ faults, yet he does not know the cause of those faults. In such a case, what am I to do?”

**【1】**
*Exegesis*: His surname was Yan, given name He, a worthy man of Lu. The crown prince was Kuai Kui. Yan He traveled from Lu to Wei, intending to serve as the prince’s tutor.
*Philological Notes*: *Yan He*: pronounced *hú là* in fanqie; Xiang and Cui’s editions write it as *è*. A worthy and reclusive man of Lu. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern editions write *è* as *hé*. *Duke Ling of Wei*: The *Zuozhuan* states his given name was Yuan. *Crown prince*: pronounced *tài*; Sima states this was Kuai Kui.

**【2】**
*Exegesis*: His surname was Qu, given name Yuan, courtesy name Boyu, a worthy minister of Wei. Kuai Kui possessed a naturally cruel virtue, delighting in slaughter. Since he was a man of Wei, the text says “there is a man here.” As Yan He was about to serve as the heir’s tutor, he sought counsel from this wise man.
*Philological Notes*: *Qu*: pronounced *qí jū* in fanqie. *Boyu*: given name Yuan, a minister of Wei. *Heaven’s killing*: read as written, meaning “like Heaven’s killing of things.” Xu reads it as *suǒ liè*.

**【3】**
*Commentary*: The nature of petty men is such that if you guide them with rules, they resent you; if you indulge their lawlessness, they bring chaos to the state.
*Exegesis*: *Fang* means method. Kuai Kui’s nature was cruel and stubborn, devoid of benevolence and righteousness. If you imposed methods upon him, his resentment of restraint would endanger you; if you indulged his lawlessness, his excesses would ruin the state.
*Philological Notes*: *Without method*: Li explains *fang* as the Way.

**【4】**
*Commentary*: He does not know that the people’s faults arise from himself, so he blames the people and does not reform.
*Exegesis*: Unrepentant in his own misconduct, he meted out extreme punishments for the people’s crimes. He saw only the commoners’ faults, unaware that their errors stemmed from himself. Though he knew that, like wind bending grass, blame lay with the ruler, he failed to grasp this truth.
*Philological Notes*: *His knowledge*: pronounced *zhì*.

**【5】**
*Exegesis*: *Ran* means “thus.” “What am I to do?”—Yan He sought Qu Yuan’s counsel, hence his exposition. Qu Boyu said: “Excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious, and rectify yourself! For in your conduct, nothing surpasses compliance, and in your heart, nothing surpasses harmony. Yet even these two have their dangers. In compliance, do not overstep; in harmony, do not stand out. If your conduct complies and oversteps, you will face ruin, destruction, collapse, and defeat. If your heart harmonizes and stands out, you will invite fame, reputation, calamity, and disaster. If he acts like a child, join him as a child; if he abandons boundaries, join him in abandoning boundaries; if he knows no limits, join him in knowing no limits. Master this, and you will enter without flaw.”

**【1】**
*Commentary*: Repeated meetings and reflections are both means to rectify oneself.
*Exegesis*: *Jie* means exhortation. One must not act recklessly. Be vigilant in guiding the crown prince, avoiding offense, walking the upright path, and adapting to circumstances. First, Qu Boyu praised Yan He’s inquiry, then provided the method.
*Philological Notes*: *Rectify yourself*: pronounced *rǔ*; same below. *Repeated*: pronounced *fān fú*.

**【2】**
*Commentary*: In conduct, do not oppose; in heart, harmonize without conformity.
*Exegesis*: In body, comply without violating the rites of ruler and minister. In mind, harmonize your wisdom, blending your actions to achieve success.

**【3】**
*Exegesis*: The two principles above outline the approach, but they are not yet perfect and still entail risks.

**【4】**
*Commentary*: Compliance in conduct leads to overstepping and identification.
*Exegesis*: Guo’s commentary states: “Compliance in conduct leads to overstepping and identification.”

**【5】**
*Commentary*: Harmony uses righteousness to aid, but standing out is self-promotion.
*Exegesis*: Harmonize your mind and employ skillful means to guide him, attributing success to the crown prince without displaying your own ability—this is not standing out.

**【6】**
*Commentary*: If you fully identify with him, you will fail to support him in danger and perish with him. Thus, you should emulate the patterns of Heaven and Earth, differing only in minor ways.
*Exegesis*: *Dian* means collapse; *mie*, annihilation; *beng*, destruction; *jue*, defeat. If your conduct complies and you fully adopt his evil, you will fail to support him in danger, leading to collapse, annihilation, destruction, and defeat—perishing with him.
*Philological Notes*: *Jue*: Xu reads it as *qí yuè*; Guo as *jué*; Li as *jǔ*. *Mó gé*: pronounced *mò hú*; ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern editions write *mó* with the wood radical as *mú*.

**【7】**
*Commentary*: If you display your harmony, you will earn a reputation for tolerance; if you aid his reputation, he will resent your superiority and falsely accuse you of calamity. Thus, you should remain obscure as darkness, blending like dust and light, so that he cannot grow close or distant, benefit or harm you.
*Exegesis*: *Yao* means to transform things into omens; *nie*, disaster. Though you harmonize and blend like dust and light, if you display your wisdom and fail to conceal your brilliance, you will earn a reputation for aiding him. Kuai Kui, resenting your superiority, will falsely accuse you of calamity and harm you.

◎ My late uncle remarked: Harmony begins with the mutual blending of the five flavors—sweet and pungent used together, merging without form. If you display it outwardly, it is no longer harmony. Timing their joy and anger, following their urgency or slowness, you regulate and subdue their mechanism without engaging in resistance or compliance. Where there is resistance or compliance, there is emergence and withdrawal; harmony does not desire emergence, for it has no resistance.

**Phonetic Glosses**:

*Jiang wu* (将恶): *wū lù* (乌路反).
*Men ran* (闷然): *mén* (音门).

**【8】**
*Commentary*: Do not establish minor sharp edges to provoke his scales.

*Exegesis*: *Tǐng* means boundary; *qí*, ridge. *Yǔ* means to share; *rù*, to meet. Navigating the world and engaging with others is truly difficult. One cannot simply merge into harmony, nor should one abruptly generate discord. Sometimes, emulate the ignorance of an infant, utterly without knowledge; at other times, resemble the boundless fields without ridges, lacking all demarcation. Indulge in extravagant desires, permit the ferocity of slaughter—then guide them with virtue, align them with ritual. Only those who grasp this principle will meet the Way without entanglement.

*Wú yá* (无崖): Sima explains: "Disregarding the law."
*Wú cī* (无疵): *sì yí* (似移反). Means illness.

Do you not know the mantis? It brandishes its arms in fury against the wheel tracks, unaware of its inability to bear the task—such is the beauty of its talent. Beware, take heed! To accumulate your boasted excellence and challenge him is perilous indeed.

**【1】**
*Commentary*: The mantis’s furious brandishing of its arms is not without beauty; yet opposing the wheel tracks, it is simply no match. Now, to confront what lies beyond your capacity with forced competence is precisely the mantis’s furious brandishing.

*Exegesis*: The mantis is an insect with axe-like limbs. When the mantis flares its arms in anger against the wheel tracks of a chariot, though it relies on the beauty of its talent, it cannot possibly fulfill its task. This is like Yan He attempting to match his own abilities against the power of the heir apparent—how is it different from the mantis brandishing its arms against the wheel tracks?

**Phonetic Gloss**:
*Bù shèng* (不胜): *shēng* (音升).

◎ Qingfan notes: The *Imperial Digest* (vol. 946) cites Sima: "It is not that it lacks fine talent—it is simply unequal to the task." The *Phonetic Gloss* omits this.

**【2】**
*Commentary*: To amass your talent, to boast of your excellence, and to challenge this man is the path to danger.

*Exegesis*: *Jī* means to accumulate. *Ér* means "you." *Jī* means peril.

Having been entrusted as tutor to the heir apparent, one ought to be cautious and vigilant. Yet now you accumulate talent and boast of your own excellence, provoking his power and authority—this will surely lead to peril and ruin. Do you not understand the way of those who raise tigers? They dare not feed it living creatures, for fear of its rage when killing them. They dare not give it whole prey, for fear of its fury when tearing it apart. They time its hunger and satiety, and thus appease its wrathful heart. Though tigers and humans are of different kinds, the tiger flatters and fawns upon its keeper—this is because it is compliant. Thus, what it kills is what resists it.

**【1】**
*Commentary*: They fear that the tiger, harboring a killing intent, will become enraged.

*Exegesis*: Do you know the method by which the world raises tigers? One must not offer living swine or sheep to fierce beasts, lest they grow furious in the act of killing.

◎ Jia Shifu notes: "How close it is!"—referring to the tiger’s enraged gaze upon the mantis, nearly approaching it. This is one who fails to measure his own talent. The tiger’s wrath can be tamed; the finest horse, if made to chafe at the bit, break its head, and shatter its chest in fury, is no different—simply do not provoke it. What advantage does the mantis gain by clashing with the chariot tracks? Why does it do this?

**Phonetic Gloss**:
*Wèi qí* (为其): *yú wěi* (于伪) *fǎn*. The same below.

**【2】**
*Commentary*: If the tiger is made to tear its food apart itself, it will grow enraged through exertion.

*Exegesis*: Do you know that even when offering dead prey to beasts, one must first divide it? If the tiger is made to tear it apart itself, one fears it will grow enraged through exertion.

*Phonetic Gloss*:
*Fēn zhī* (分之): read as written.

**【3】**
*Commentary*: Know the cause of its rage and comply with it.

*Exegesis*: Know the times of its hunger and satiety, grasp the bounds of its joy and anger, and be attuned to the patterns of things—how could danger or ruin then arise?

**【4】**
*Commentary*: Comply with the Dao, and even different species will grow affectionate; defy its rhythms, and even the closest kin will take up arms against one another.

*Exegesis*: For compliance brings delight and submission—even tigers and wolves may be tamed and befriended. Defiance brings slaughter and harm—even the closest kin may turn to armed conflict. The way of pleasing others is the same; the method of engaging with things is no different.

◎ Jia Shifu notes: To understand the heart of rage is to have a means of acting. What is called "compliance" does not mean indulging its desires, but neither allowing killing without guiding its rage nor permitting division without releasing its rage. If one simply avoids provoking its rage, its heart will always find its own way to expression—then it is compliant. The lover of horses gathers their dung in baskets and collects their urine in shells. Yet when a gadfly alights upon one and the master fails to stroke it in time, the horse may break its bit, smash its head, and shatter its chest. Love may reach its limit, and care may be lost—can one not be cautious?

【1】**Annotation:** Though dung and urine are most base, to gather them in precious vessels is the utmost in love for horses.
**Subcommentary:** *Shen* are large clams. To value a horse’s excrement is to prize it highly. Though dung and urine are most base, to collect them in large clams is to be so bound by affection that one goes to such lengths.
**Phonetic Glosses:** *Sheng shi* (盛矢) reads *chéng*; the same below and in the annotation. *Shi* (矢) may also be written *shǐ* (屎), with the same meaning. *Yǐ shèn* (以蜃) reads *shèn* (Xú: *shì zhěn* 反), a type of clam. *Nì* (溺) reads *niào* (奴吊反).

【2】**Annotation:** Swarming densely upon the horse.
**Phonetic Glosses:** *Pū* (仆) reads *wén* (音文); some editions write it □, with the same meaning. *Méng* (虻) reads *méng* (孟庚反). *Pūyuán* (仆缘) reads *pǔmù* (普木反) or *fūmù* (徐敷木反). Xiàng says: *pūpūrán* (仆仆然) describes the dense swarming of gadflies on the horse. Cuī reads it as written, glossing it as *púyù* (仆御).
◎ **Wang Niansun notes:** Both Xiàng’s and Cuī’s interpretations are incorrect. *Pū* (仆) means *to cling*; it describes gadflies clinging to the horse’s body. *Pū* and *fù* (附) are similar in sound and meaning. In the *Greater Odes* ("Jìng zuì" 既醉), the *Máo Commentary* glosses *pú* (仆) as *fù* (附). The *Zheng Commentary* says: "The great mandate of Heaven clings to you." The *Wen Xuan* annotation to the *Zǐxū Fù* quotes the *Guǎngyǎ* as saying: "*Pú* means to cling to a person." (Note: This line does not appear in the current *Guǎngyǎ*; *Guǎngyǎ* may be a corruption of *Guǎngcāng*.) *Qúnzhuó* (群着) reads *zhíluè* (直略反).

【3】**Annotation:** Though one seeks to remedy the trouble, startling the horse by acting unexpectedly.
**Phonetic Glosses:** *Ér fǔ* (而拊) reads *fǔ* (李: *fǔ*, 又 *fù*; 一音 *fù*). Cuī’s edition writes it *fǔ* (府), reading *fù* (附).

【4】**Annotation:** Taking it unawares, one startles it into such a state.
**Subcommentary:** *Pū* (仆) means *to gather*. *Fǔ* (拊) means *to pat*. *Xián* (衔) means *the bit*.

Just then, horseflies gathered in swarms upon the horse. The master, cherishing his steed, suddenly patted it, intending to remove the nuisance. Without regard for timing, he startled the horse unawares, causing it to bolt in terror. Thereupon, the horse snapped its bit and reins, tore apart its bridle, and trampled its rider, crushing his head and shattering his chest.

【5】**Annotation:** Though the intent was to eliminate the harm, acting impulsively in patting it led to such destruction—losing what he sought to cherish. Thus, in engaging with the world, one must exercise utmost caution in matters of adversity and compliance.

**Subcommentary:** *Wáng* (亡) means *to lose*. His intent (now corrected to *zhì* 至) was to cherish the horse, yet by damaging it, he lost what he loved. In human affairs, the principle is the same: when stimuli and responses fall out of alignment, disaster follows. The lesson of patting the horse should be heeded with great care.

◎ The late Master of the Jiā clan remarks: As people interact to form society, beauty and ugliness arise, compliance and defiance diverge, and adversity and compliance take shape. From this, great calamities emerge. To say others are unfit for companionship is to overlook one’s own unfitness to engage with them. In dealing with oneself, to remain without utility is to attain the Way. Virtue dissipates in pursuit of fame, and wisdom arises from contention—this is the central theme of the present chapter. Only by relinquishing fame and contention in the five concluding passages can one move freely within the human world.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Shuàirán* (率然) reads *shuàilǜ* (疏律反). Some editions write *zú* (卒), reading *qīhū* (七忽反).
**Collation:** The character *zhì* (至) is amended following the main text and Guo’s annotation.

When the artisan Shí traveled to Qí and reached Qūyuán, he saw an oak enshrined as a local earth deity. The tree was so vast it could shade thousands of oxen, its girth requiring a hundred spans to encircle. Its height towered seventy *rèn* above the mountains before branches emerged, and its lateral boughs—ten or more—could each be fashioned into a boat. Spectators thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter paid no heed and passed by without pause.

【1】**Subcommentary:** *Zhī* (之) means *to go to*. *Qūyuán* is a place name. Its roads wind like the Huányuán Pass west of Mount Sōng—this is of the same kind. *Lì* is the name of the tree; *shè*, the earth deity. Earth altars are called *shè* (社), meaning "to sprout," for they bring forth the myriad things. *Jiàng* is the general term for craftsmen; *Shí* is the given name of this skilled artisan. Traveling from Lǔ to Qí, he passed through the winding roads and saw this extraordinary tree—gnarled and useless. This illustrates that to navigate the human world, one must treat the useless as useful.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Qūyuán* (曲辕) reads *yuán* (袁). Sīmǎ explains: *Qūyuán* means winding roads. Cuī says: It is the name of a road. *Lì* (栎) reads *lìdí* (力狄反). Lǐ explains: It is the name of a tree; another says: *qiú* (梂).
◎ Lú Wénchāo notes: *Qiú* (梂) appears as *cǎi* (采) in most editions, an error. Here corrected following the Song edition.

【2】**Subcommentary:** *Xié* (絜) means *to bind*. The *lì* tree of the earth shrine stood far taller than ordinary trees, its branches and leaves casting shade over thousands of oxen. Measured with a rope, its circumference spanned a hundred *chǐ*. The Jiangnan Zhuāng edition often speaks of it shading an ox, omitting "thousands"—this version appears corrupt. Moreover, the tree of Shāngqiū could shelter a thousand chariots; how could the tree of Qūyuán shade only one ox? By this comparison, the version with "thousands" is correct.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Bìniú* (蔽牛) reads *bìshì* (必世反). Lǐ explains: Oxen standing beside it would not be seen. *Xié* (絜) reads *hùjié* (户结反) in Xiàng and Xú, and *hǔjié* (虎结反) in Xú—meaning *to bind*.
◎ Qìngfān notes: The *Wén Xuǎn* annotation to Jiǎ Yì’s *Guò Qín Lùn* cites Sīmǎ: *Xié* means *to encircle*. This is omitted in the phonetic glosses.

【3】**Subcommentary:** Seven *chǐ* make one *rèn*. This tree soared over seventy *chǐ* before its branches emerged, blocking the sun and scraping the clouds. Its lateral boughs—ten or more—were each large enough to make a boat. Such was its form.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Shírèn* (十仞): The *Xiǎo Ěr Yǎ* states: Four *chǐ* make one *rèn*. (Note: Seven *chǐ* make one *rèn*.) Cuī’s edition writes *qiān rèn* (千仞). Some say: Eight *chǐ* make one *rèn*. *Páng shíshù* (旁十数) reads *suǒjù* (所具反). Cuī explains: *Páng* means lateral branches.
◎ Yú Yuè notes: *Páng* should be read as *fāng*, as the characters are interchangeable. The *Shàng Shū*’s *Gāo Yáo Mó* reads *fāng shī xiàng xíng* (方施象刑), while the *Xīn Xù*’s *Jié Shì* reads *fāng zuò páng* (方作旁). The *Fǔ Xíng* reads *fāng gào wú gū* (方告无辜), while the *Lùn Héng*’s *Biàn Dòng* reads *fāng zuò páng* (方作旁)—all attest to this interchange. The *Zài Yòu* chapter’s *chūrù wú páng* (出入无旁) means *chūrù wú fāng* (出入无方), providing further evidence of this substitution in the present text. The *Shī Jīng*’s *Zhēng Yuè* reads *mín jīn fāng dài* (民今方殆), with the Zhèng commentary: *Fāng* means "about to." Thus, *qí kěyǐ wéi zhōu zhě fāng shíshù* (其可以为舟者方十数) means "those that could be made into boats were about ten or more." The phonetic glosses cite Cuī: *Páng* means lateral branches, likely unaware that *páng* is a substitute for *fāng*, thus mistaking a grammatical particle for a concrete term.

【4】**Subcommentary:** *Chuò* (辍) means *to stop*. The tree was extraordinarily large, drawing crowds of onlookers. Only the artisan Shí recognized its uselessness and passed by without a glance.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Guānzhě* (观者) reads *guānhuàn* (古奂反), also *guān* (官). *Jiàngbó* (匠伯): *Bó* is the courtesy name of Shí. Cuī’s edition also writes *Shí* (石).
◎ Qìngfān notes: The *Wén Xuǎn* annotations to Hé Yàn’s *Jǐng Fú Diàn Fù*, Wáng Zǐyuān’s *Dòng Xiāo Fù*, Xī Shūyè’s *Qín Fù*, Sīmǎ Shàotōng’s poem *Zèng Shān Tāo*, and Zhāng Jǐngyáng’s *Qī Mìng* all cite Sīmǎ: *Jiàng Shí* has the courtesy name *Bó*. This is omitted in the phonetic glosses. *Bùchuò* (不辍) reads *dīngliè* (丁劣反).

【Collation:】(1) The Shìdétáng edition omits the phrase "thousands of," aligning with the *Phonetic Glosses*; the omission is cited as an error, while the Jiāngnán Lǐ edition and Zhāng Jūnfáng’s edition retain it.

The disciple, weary of gazing, ran to catch up with Artisan Shí and said, “Since I took up the axe to follow you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent as this. Why does the Master refuse to look and walk on without pause?”

【1】**Subcommentary:** The disciple, astonished by the grandeur of the sacred oak, halted to observe it. Proud of his long apprenticeship, he had never seen timber so vast (and strange). Perplexed by the artisan’s indifference, he ran to catch up and inquired.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Yàn* (厌) reads *yúyàn* (于艳反), also *yúzhān* (于瞻反).

Artisan Shí said, “Enough! Say no more! It is a *sàn*-wood. If fashioned into a boat, it would sink; as a coffin or outer coffin, it would swiftly rot; as a vessel, it would quickly break; as a door or gate, it would ooze sap; as a pillar, it would be devoured by worms. This is a worthless tree, of no use whatsoever—thus it attains such longevity.”

【1】**Subcommentary:** *Yǐ* (已) means *to cease*. Artisan Shí, recognizing the great tree’s worthlessness—unfit for worldly use—rebuked his disciple for wasting words and bade him stop.

【2】**Subcommentary:** The oak is heavy; as a boat, it would sink. Prone to decay near soil, as a coffin it would swiftly perish. Such a diffuse and useless tree fulfills its natural span, for it is precisely its worthlessness that grants it idleness.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Sànmù* (散木) reads *xīdàn* (悉但反), Xú [Xuǎn] reads *xīdàn* (悉旦反). The same applies below.

「《则速》*read as written*. Formerly, Cuī’s edition had *shù* (数). *Xiàng* reads *suǒ lù* (所禄反). The same applies below. 《腐》*fǔ*, *fú fǔ* (扶甫反).」

【3】**Subcommentary:** Among human utensils, value lies in durability. Since the oak is brittle and porous, its early ruin is beyond doubt!

【4】**Subcommentary:** *Mán* refers to the oozing of sap. *Dù* are the worms within wood. As doors or gates, it exudes sap and resin; as beams or pillars, it is infested and unstable.

**Phonetic Glosses:** 《液》*yè*, pronounced *yì*. 《樠》*mán*, *máng yán* (亡言反). Xiàng [Xiàng Xiū] reads *lǐ mò gān* (李莫干反); Guō [Xiàng] reads *wǔ bàn* (武半反). Sīmǎ [Biāo] says: *yè* means "fluid"; *mán* refers to resin flowing thickly. Cuī [Yī] says: "black fluid." ◎ Lǐ Zhēn notes: *Guǎngyùn* 22 *yuán*: *mán* is the heartwood of pine, also a tree name. *Shuōwén*: *mán* is pine heartwood. Duàn [Yùcái]’s commentary: "Likely an omission; should read ‘pine heartwood; also called a tree name.’" The edition Lù [Démíng] relied upon was an ancient *Shuōwén*. Since pine heartwood contains resin, *yè mán* precisely captures this meaning—resin flowing like pine heartwood. This is the subtlety of Zhuāngzǐ’s wordplay. Neither the subcommentary nor the phonetic glosses clarify the sense. Further, *Guǎngyùn* defines *□* as pine resin; Duàn says this is a corruption of *mán* as "pine resin." I suspect *□* is an alternate form of *mán*. 《蠹》*dù*, *dīng gù* (丁故反).

【5】**Commentary:** Not among the ranks of usable timber—hence called a "worthless tree."

**Subcommentary:** Idle, brittle, and porous, it is a useless tree, unfit for any application—thus it escapes early demise.

The carpenter returned home. The oak of the shrine appeared to him in a dream, saying: "With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the *patterned trees*? Consider the hawthorn, pear, orange, and pomelo—fruit-bearing kinds: when their fruit ripens, they are stripped, and in stripping, they are humiliated. Their great branches break, their small branches are torn. This is how their abilities bring suffering to their lives. Thus they do not complete their natural span but perish midway, self-destructing against the common world. All things are no different. As for me, I have long sought worthlessness, nearly dying before attaining it—yet now I have found it to be my great use. Had I been of use, could I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how can one thing pass judgment upon another? And you, a nearly dead worthless man—what could you know of a worthless tree?"

【1】**Commentary:** All usable timber is called *patterned wood*.

**Subcommentary:** *Wū hū* means "in what." *Ruò* means "you." *Yú* means "I."

The wood that can be used is called *patterned wood*. The master carpenter returned to his rest, and the oak of the sacred altar appeared to him in a dream, asking: "With what will you compare me? Shall you take me for a worthless, scattered tree? Or shall you liken me to a useful, patterned wood?"

The master carpenter awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple said: "If you sought worthlessness, why then serve as a sacred altar?"

**Commentary:** All things are harmed by their own usefulness.

**Subcommentary:** That which grows on trees is called *fruit*—such as crabapples and pears; that which grows on the ground is called *gourds*—such as melons and calabashes. How could you compare me to such things?

Is it not that the flavor of these fruits and gourds, though pleasing to the taste, brings suffering to their lives once their seeds ripen? They are stripped and humiliated, their great branches broken, their small branches torn. Is this not because their sweetness becomes the very cause of their bitter existence? Such is the meaning of "humiliation." Though they sprout in spring and fall in autumn, completing their natural span, they are struck down midway—this is called "untimely death." Yet the world, both sentient and insentient, all things with form, are cut short in their prime by their own usefulness. Thus it is said: "All things are no different." *Pou* means "to strike."

The oak had long been watched by others, but only now did the master carpenter truly see it.

To accumulate worthlessness is to attain the great use of preserving life.

The oak had long sought worthlessness, nearly dying before attaining it—yet now it had found its great use. Had it been useful, would it have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how can one thing pass judgment upon another?

If it had been useful, it would long since have been felled.

You and I are both creations of the same transforming power—how could one thing truly know another? *Nai he zai* is a rhetorical question.

The oak spoke in jest to the master carpenter. The carpenter had deemed it worthless, calling it a "scattered tree," while the oak, though capable, considered itself useless. Thus it called the carpenter a "scattered man." Those who flaunt their abilities in the world court untimely death, while I, through my scattered worthlessness, have preserved my life. You, a nearly dead scattered man—what could you know of a scattered tree? This was spoken in a dream to jest with the master carpenter.

The master carpenter awoke and pondered the dream in his sleep, recounting it to his disciples.

His disciples asked, “If it sought worthlessness, why then did it become a shrine tree?”

The master replied, “Hush!”

"Hush! It merely lodged there of its own accord—taking it as the scorn and reproach of those who fail to understand it. Had it not become a shrine tree, it might well have been felled! Moreover, what it preserves differs from the common—yet to measure it by praise is indeed far off the mark!"

---

**[1] [Annotation]** The shrine came to lodge there on its own; the tree did not seek to become a shrine.

**[2] [Annotation]** This tree regards the shrine as one who fails to recognize its worth, bringing only humiliation and affliction—how could this be honor?

**[Commentary]** *Ruò* (若) means "you." *Bǐ* (彼) refers to the shrine. You must be discreet and guard your words. The spirit of the shrine came to lodge here of its own accord; it is not that this tree (*lì*, 栎) *delights* in becoming a shrine.

**[3] [Annotation]** *Gòu* (诟) means humiliation. To think that the shrine spirit, failing to grasp that the tree values uselessness as its true use—cherishing the preservation of its life—would arbitrarily come to lodge here, heaping scorn and affliction upon it, turning it into a disgrace—how could this be honor?

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Gòu* (诟): Li [Yi] reads *hū dòu* (呼豆) in reverse; Xu [Shen] reads it as *gòu* (垢).

"The character *lì* (厉) is read as written. Sima [Biao] says: *Gòu* means humiliation; *lì* means affliction.

**[3] [Commentary]** The tree, originally regarding uselessness as its true use, would thus—even if not made into a shrine—ultimately avoid the harm of being cut down.

**[Exegesis]** Fundamentally, by being sparse and unfit for use, it preserves the Dao of its life. Even if it were not a shrine tree, how could it ever draw near to the harm of being cut down?

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Qiě jī* (且几): Read as *jī* (机), or alternatively as *qí* (祈).
*Jiǎn hū* (翦乎): Read as *zǐ qiǎn* (子浅) in reverse. Cui [Shu] writes it as *qián yú* (前于).
◎ Qing Fan notes: *Hū* (乎) is written as *yú* (于) in Cui’s version; *yú* here means *hū*. In the *Lunyu* (*Wei Zheng* chapter), it is written *xiào hū wéi xiào* (孝乎惟孝), where both the Huang Kan edition and the Han Stone Classics write *yú* (于). In the *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Shen Ying* chapter), it is written *rán zé xiān wáng shèng yú* (然则先王圣于), where Gao [You]’s commentary states: *yú* means *hū*. These are all examples of this usage.
*Bù jìn* (不近): The *jìn* (近) here means proximity. The same applies below.

**[4] [Commentary]** That [tree] regards having no safeguard as its safeguard, while the multitude regards having safeguards as their safeguard.

**[Exegesis]** The sparse tree preserves its life through uselessness, while those of fine timber perish young due to their talent—this is why they differ.

**[5] [Commentary]** Benefiting others and nurturing things, restraining the people from wrongdoing—this is the meaning of the shrine. As for the useless, they are tranquil and do not act, yet the various talents act of their own accord. Those who act of their own accord each attain their proper place without interference—this is how the useless preserve their lives. You praise it as a shrine—how could it possibly draw near [to harm]?

**[Exegesis]** The scattered wood, unfit for use, is endowed by the Creator; relying on its uselessness, it preserves its life. Yet the shrine spirit lodges here, bringing humiliation and affliction, and now you further praise it with the meaning of the shrine—this is even more mistaken.

South伯子綦 wandered in the hills of 商丘 and saw an extraordinary great tree. A thousand chariots could shelter beneath its shade, finding refuge in the coolness of its canopy.

子綦 exclaimed, “What tree is this? It must possess some extraordinary quality!”

Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and twisted, unfit for beams or rafters. Looking down at its massive roots, he saw they were split and fissured like an axle, unfit for coffins or outer caskets. Tasting its leaves, his mouth grew inflamed and ulcerated. Inhaling its scent, he became wildly intoxicated, raving for three days without cease.

**[Annotation 1]** *Its branches cast such deep shade that a thousand chariots could shelter beneath them.*
**[Exegesis]** *伯* means "elder." His Dao is most venerable, worthy to be the elder of all things, hence he is called *伯*—here, 南郭子綦. 商丘 is a place name in the region of 梁宋. A team of four horses is called a *chariot*. *藾* means "shade." In the land of 宋, 子綦 passed through 商丘 and encountered this great tree, unlike any ordinary one. Its trunk was massive, its branches and leaves luxuriant, casting deep shade that sheltered vast space—enough to cover a thousand chariots and shield their horses.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *《南伯》* Li [Yuxi] says: This is 南郭. *伯* means "elder."
*《商之丘》* Sima [Biao] says: This is present-day 睢阳 County in 梁国.
*《千乘》* *Shèng* rhymes with *zhèng*.
*《隐》* Cui [Yuan] says: Harmed by heat.
*《将芘》* Also written as *庇*. Xu [Shen] reads *fǔ zhì*; also *bēi wèi*. Cui’s edition writes *比*, glossing it as *芘*.
*《所藾》* Pronounced *lài*. Cui’s edition writes *赖*. Xiang [Xiu] says: "Shade, sufficient to shelter a thousand chariots." Li [Yuxi] concurs.
*《所阴》* Pronounced *yú zhèn*.

**[Exegesis 2]** Having seen this tree, 子綦 did not recognize its name but suspected it possessed some extraordinary power, hence its great size.

**[Exegesis 3]** *轴解* means "split like an axle," referring to the heartwood’s spiral grain. The inner coffin encases the body; *棺* means "complete." The outer casket encases the coffin.

The ridgepole and beams must be straight; what is gnarled and crooked is thus unfit. The coffin and outer casket rely on solidity; what splits and scatters is thus unstable.

**[Exegesis 4]**
To lick the leaves with the tongue is to blister and injure the lips and mouth; to inhale their scent with the nose is to induce unceasing intoxication and stupor. *Chéng* means the sickness of wine.

Ziqi says: "This is indeed a useless tree, yet it has grown to such great size! Alas, the spirit-like person—such is their uselessness!"

**[Exegesis 1]**
A body wholly without use may be called the great talent of preserving life intact; though all deem it useless, this is in truth the wondrous utility of aiding things. Thus it escapes the axe’s early doom and shelters a thousand chariots.

**[Commentary]**
The king who is "useless" among the hundred officials allows each to manage their own affairs: the clear-sighted see for him, the keen-eared hear for him, the wise counsel for him, the brave shield him. What does he do? He abides in profound stillness alone. And since none of the many talents fail in their proper place, this "uselessness" is precisely what all talent depends upon. Thus the world delights in exalting him without tiring, and he rides the myriad things without harming them.

**[Exegesis]**
The utmost person is divine—so unfathomable that even yin and yang cannot gauge them. Moving unseen among the common, their harmonious radiance does not dazzle. Thus they strike deep roots and firm their stem, attaining long life and enduring vision, bearing all things like a boat, shading and covering the black-haired people. Like that oak of the earth-altar, or this extraordinary tree, one sighs in admiration at the spirit-like person’s use: what seems useless is in fact the greatest talent.

In the **Collation Notes**, the Zhao Jianyi edition reads *chén* (臣) instead of *chéng* (乘).

In the state of Song, there was a place called Jingshi, where catalpa, Chinese catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those trees that grew to the size of a hand’s embrace or less were felled by those seeking pegs for gibbons; those of three or four spans around were felled by those seeking timber for lofty beams or fine boats; those of seven or eight spans around were felled by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking single-plank coffins. Thus, before completing their natural span, they met an untimely end beneath the axe—such is the peril of being useful.

Therefore, in sacrificial rites, a bull with a white forehead, a pig with an upturned snout, or a man afflicted with hemorrhoids were deemed unfit for the river. The shamans and invocators knew this well: these were considered inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as the greatest auspice.

**[Exegesis]**
Jingshi is a place name. In the region of Jingshi within the state of Song, catalpa, cypress, and mulberry—these three kinds of trees—grew perfectly straight, fit for use as timber. Here, the text briefly illustrates how fine timber meets an early end due to its usefulness, contrasting it with the earlier passage on the scattered, "useless" trees that preserve their lives.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Jingshi*: Sima Biao explains this as a place name. Another interpretation holds it as a village name. *Yi qiu bai sang* (宜楸柏桑): Cui notes that the land of Jingshi was suited to these three trees. Li comments that these three are "fine timber."
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: In modern editions, *qiu* (秋) is written as *qiū* (楸).

**[Exegesis]**
A tree that can be clasped with both hands is called *gǒng*; with one hand, *bǎ*. *Jūhóu* refers to macaques. *Yì* means a stake or post. Trees of this size were felled to make pegs or poles for striking or restraining macaques.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Gǒng*: Pronounced *gōngyǒng*. *Bǎ*: Pronounced *bǎyǎ* (Xu) or *fǔyǎ* (alternate). Sima Biao: "Clasped with both hands is *gǒng*; with one hand, *bǎ*." *Érshàng*: Pronounced *shízhǎng*. *Jū*: Pronounced *qīyú*. *Hóu*: Pronounced *hóu*. *Zhīyì*: Pronounced *yǐzhí* or *yángzhí* (Guo), or *bā* (Sima). Li: "Used to perch and play with macaques." Cui’s edition reads *bá*, pronounced *bá*, meaning a cangue.

**[Exegesis]**
*Lì* refers to roof beams or small boats. *Gāomíng* means honor and renown. Trees of three or four spans in girth were sought by those desiring fine beams for high roofs or prestigious boats.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Sānwéi*: Cui: "A span of eight *chǐ* is one *wéi*." *Zhīlì*: Read as *lì* or *lǐ*. Sima Biao: "A small boat, or a roof beam."
◎ Qingfan notes: *Míng* means "great." The passage refers to those seeking grand and imposing structures, using trees of three or four spans. (The interpretation of *míng* as "great" is discussed in the *Tiānxià* chapter, under "three hundred famous mountains.")

**[Exegesis]**
*Shànbàng* refers to coffins. It may also denote a single, unjointed side of a coffin. Trees of seven or eight spans were felled by the wealthy and merchant classes seeking large planks for coffins.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Qiúshàn*: Also written as *shàn* (擅), pronounced *shàn*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: In older editions, *shàn* was incorrectly written with the *shì* (示) radical. The same error appears in the commentary; this has been corrected. *Bàng*: Pronounced *bógāng*. Cui: "*Shànbàng* means a coffin." Sima Biao: "A single side of a coffin is called *shànbàng*."

**[Commentary]**
Those with useful timber cannot escape its value.

**[Exegesis]**
Because they are useful, they do not live out their natural years but are cut down midway by craftsmen—such is the harm wrought by their own utility.

**[Commentary]**
In exorcisms, shamans discard these three: a bull with a white forehead, a pig with an upturned snout, and a man with hemorrhoids. Only the finest, unblemished animals are deemed fit for use.

**[Exegesis]**
*Sǎng* means the forehead. *Kàng* means high. *Zhì* refers to anal fistulas. When shamans prepare dogs for sacrifices or select pigs and cattle for exorcisms, they must choose animals of pure color and fine quality, demonstrating reverence as if the spirits were present. Thus, a pig with a high snout or broken forehead, a calf with a white forehead (not pure red), or a man with hemorrhoids—all are unclean and unfit for the sacred river or sacrificial rites. In ancient times, people were drowned in the river to appease the River Earl; when Ximen Bao served as magistrate of Ye, he put an end to this practice—this is one such example.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Gùjiě*: Pronounced *gǔmài* (Xu) or *jiāmài* (alternate), with the same pronunciation in the commentary. Xiang: *gǔxiè*.

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*Sǎng*: Pronounced *xīdǎng* (反切). Sima [Biao] says: the forehead.
*Kàngbí*: Xu [Shen] reads *gǔzàng* (反切). Sima says: "high"; the forehead is broken, so the nose is high. Cui [Yuan] says: "upturned."
*Zhì*: Xu reads *zhílǐ* (反切). Sima says: "hidden sores."
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The character *yún* (云) was missing in old editions; now restored.
*Shì Hé*: Sima says: refers to drowning people in the river as sacrifice.
*Xīngjù*: Pronounced *xùyíng* (反切).

**[Text and Commentary]**
**[7]** *[Annotation]* Shamans and invocators also know that the unfit are preserved intact.
**[8]** *[Annotation]* That which preserves life whole is what the world calls auspicious. Yet shamans and invocators deem the unfit inauspicious and reject them—thus, what they call inauspicious is precisely what preserves life whole, which is the greatest auspice. The spirit-like person is one who follows things without preconceived intent. Therefore, what the world calls the greatest auspice, the spirit-like person does not oppose.

**[Exegesis]**
Women are called *wū* (shamans); men are called *xí* (mediums). *Zhù* (invocators) are those who hold tablets and recite sacrificial texts. *Xiáng* means "good." When shamans, invocators, and scribes perform exorcisms, they know these three kinds of beings are unfit for offerings and thus discard them as inauspicious. Yet the spiritually sagely person, attuned to the transformations of creation, knows that the unfit and useless are thereby preserved whole. Thus, the claims that a white forehead, a high nose, or hemorrhoids are inauspicious—these are merely the vulgar sentiments of petty shamans, not the true wisdom of the great! Therefore, those whose faculties are incomplete are precisely what the spirit-like person deems auspicious and supremely good.

**[Textual Collation]**
(1) The characters *zhī yǐ* (之以) are transposed following the *Shìdétáng* edition.
(2) *Yì* lacks the phonetic *qiěyáng*; Guo [Xiang]’s note likely omitted the characters *qiāng* (戕). The *Guǎngyùn* (11, *táng* rhyme) states under *qiāng*: *qiāngkē*, also written *zāngkē*, pronounced *láng*. The *Hànshū Dìlǐzhì* annotation for *Zāngkē* Commandery reads: *zāngqiāng* refers to mooring stakes. Thus, Guo’s original text likely read *qiāng* (戕), identical in meaning to *yì* (杙) but differing in form and pronunciation. Its pronunciation *qiěyáng* (且羊反) confirms that *qiāng*, not *yì*, was intended.

**The Uselessness of the Crippled**
*Zhīlí Shū*’s body was so disjointed that his chin nestled into his navel, his shoulders towered above his crown, his hunched spine pointed heavenward, his five viscera’s *shù* points faced upward, and his thighs pressed against his ribs. Though he sewed and washed clothes to feed himself, and played the flute to scatter grain, enough to feed ten men, when the ruler conscripted warriors, *Zhīlí* rolled up his sleeves and wandered among them; when the ruler imposed great labor, *Zhīlí* was exempted due to his chronic ailment; and when the ruler distributed grain to the sick, he received three *zhōng* of grain and ten bundles of firewood. One whose form is as disjointed as *Zhīlí*’s can still nourish his body and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is disjointed!

**[Exegesis]**
**[1]** His four limbs were fractured, his hundred bones splayed apart, forcing his chin and cheeks to recede into his navel while his shoulders rose above his crown. Such a grotesque form earned him the name *Zhīlí* ("Disjointed").
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhīlí Shū*: Sima [Biao] says: a description of a body broken and incomplete. *Shū* is his name.
*Yí*: Pronounced *yǐzhī* (反切).
*Yú dǐng*: Read as written; originally *xiàng* (项), also read as written. Sima says: "his spine is curved, his neck contracted." The *Huáinánzǐ* states: "his spinal column rises above his crown."

**[2]** *Huìcuō* describes a towering protrusion. *Wǔ guǎn* refers to the *shù* points of the five viscera. These points lie along the back; in ancient times, topknots were positioned near the crown’s rear. Now, *Zhīlí*’s deformities—hunched back and lowered head—cause his visceral *shù* points and topknot to face upward, while his thighs and calves contract toward his ribs.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Huì*: Xu reads *gǔwài* (反切); Xiàng reads *gǔhuó* (反切). Cui [Yuan] says: *huìcuō* refers to the cervical vertebrae.
*Cuō*: Xu reads *zǐwài* (反切); Xiàng and Xu read *zǐhuó* (反切). Cui says: *huìcuō* refers to the cervical vertebrae.
*Zhǐ tiān*: Sima says: *huìcuō* means "topknot." In ancient times, topknots were centered on the nape; with a curved spine and lowered head, the topknot thus pointed heavenward. Xiàng says: "his shoulders rise sharply, forming a *huìcuō* shape."
◎ Li Zhen notes: Cui’s claim that *huìcuō* refers to the cervical vertebrae is correct. (*Dàzōngshī* chapter: "The *jùzhuì* points heavenward"; Li [Yi] says: *jùzhuì* refers to the cervical vertebrae, resembling a growth—this confirms Cui’s interpretation.) The *Sùwèn*’s *Cìrè Piān* states: "The depression above the third cervical vertebra marks the center." Wang [Bing]’s annotation: "This illustrates the general numbering of spinal vertebrae." Shen Tong’s *Shì Gǔ* says: "The twenty-one vertebrae below the *dàzhuī* (great vertebra) are collectively called the spine or spinal vertebrae." Cui’s identification of *huìcuō* as the cervical vertebrae is supported by the *Nànjīng*’s 45th difficulty: "The bones converge at *dàzhù*." Zhang’s annotation: "*Dàzhù* is an acupoint behind the first cervical vertebra; all bones branch downward from this framework, hence the bones converge at *dàzhù*." This confirms that *huìcuō* derives its meaning from the convergence of bones and lies between the *dàzhuī* vertebrae. *Cuō* in the *Táng* dynasty’s *Chūxué Jì* (Vol. 19) is written as  (木节), resembling spinal nodes. The character  (from 木) better conveys the meaning. Note: The chin and shoulders pertain to external description; *huìcuō* and the five *guǎn* pertain to internal description. The chin recedes, so the shoulders rise; the cervical vertebrae point heavenward, so the visceral *shù* points face upward—these conditions arise from mutual causation. (*Língshū Bèishù Piān*: The *shù* points of the lungs lie between the third vertebrae; the heart’s between the fifth; the liver’s between the ninth; the spleen’s between the eleventh; the kidneys’ between the fourteenth.) Sima’s interpretation of *huìcuō* as "topknot" represents a separate meaning. The *Shījīng* (*Xiǎoyǎ Tàilì*) states: "*Zīcuō*, a black cloth cap." The *Máo* commentary: "*Zīcuō* is a black cloth cap."

The *Zhèngyì* states: The term *cuō* refers to a small tuft holding the topknot in place. Based on this, interpreting *huìcuō* as a topknot would likewise mean a small tuft holding the hair, hence the name. *Huì* (會) and *kuài* (□) are interchangeable. The *Shuōwén* states: "*Kuài* (□) refers to the bone pin used to gather the hair." The *Wèifēng* ("Huì Biàn Rú Xīng") passage is cited by Xǔ Shèn as *kuài* (□). The *Zhōulǐ* ("Huì Wǔcǎi Yù Qí") annotation reads: "Old texts write *huì* (會) as *kuài* (□)." The *Shì Sānglǐ* ("Kuò Biàn Yòng Sāng") commentary states: "Taking *jì* (髻) as *kuò* (髺) derives from the idea of gathering the hair." *Huì* (會) and *kuò* (髺) are also interchangeable. The *Jíyùn* includes the character *cuō* (□), pronounced *cuō*, meaning "topknot." This is likely a later, colloquial creation of a specialized character for "topknot" based on *huìcuō*. ◎ Qìngfān’s note: The *Shìwén* cites Cuī’s commentary, stating that *huìcuō* refers to the cervical vertebrae and should be written as *zhuó* (□). The *Yùpiān* defines *zhuó* (□) as "wooden mallet," pronounced *cúhuó*. *Cuō* (撮) and *zhuó* (□) are phonetically similar. The *Shīzǐ* ("Xíng Xiǎn Yǐ Cuō") states: "*Cuō* refers to a carrying vessel," pronounced identically to *zuān* (钻). The *Zhōulǐ* ("Sāng Dàjì") annotation reads: "*Chūn* is the carriage for the coffin; *zǎn* (攒) means 'to gather.'" The *Shīzǐ* term corresponds to the *Zhōulǐ*’s *zǎn*. The *Guǎn* text writes *cuō* as *guǎn* (筦). The *Zài Shàng* commentary by Lǐ states: "*Guǎn* (管) refers to the *shù* points; the *shù* points of the five viscera all lie above." The *Liǎngbì* text alternatively writes *pái* (牌), identical in pronunciation. Xú Yòufǔ reads it as *bì*. Cuī’s commentary states: "A hunchback’s abdomen lies within the thighs." The *Wéi* (為) is read as *xūjié* (许劫). Sīmǎ’s commentary states: "The spine curves while the thighs stand upright, hence they are paired." 【3】【Commentary】 *Cuòzhēn* (挫针) means sewing clothes. *Zhìxiè* (治繲) means washing and bleaching. *Hú* (糊) means feeding; it refers to laboring with one’s bodily strength to sustain life. 【*Shìwén*】 *Cuò* (挫) is read by Xú as *zǐwò* (子卧) and by Guō as *zūhé* (租禾). Cuī’s commentary states: "To press." *Zhēn* (针) is read as *zhíjīn* (执金). Sīmǎ’s commentary states: "*Cuòzhēn* means sewing clothes." *Zhì* (治) in *zhìxiè* is read as *jiàimài* (佳卖). Sīmǎ’s commentary states: "Washing clothes." Xiàng’s reading is the same. Cuī writes it as *□*, pronounced identically.

《糊口》 Xú pronounces it as *hú*. Lǐ states: "It means to eat." Cuī notes: "The character may also be written as 互 or □."

【4】【Commentary】 *Cè* refers to a small dustpan. *Jīng* means rice. This describes sweeping the marketplace, winnowing with a dustpan, scattering dust, and sifting the fine from the coarse. Another interpretation: *gǔcè* refers to casting milfoil stalks to divine hexagrams. *Bōjīng* means discerning good and ill fortune by judging the subtle and the numinous. Some sweep markets to feed their households; others sell divination to sustain their lives. What they earn can nourish ten people.

【*Shìwén*】《鼓策》 Chū pronounces it as *chūgé*; Xú alternatively as *jiá*. Sīmǎ states: "*Gǔ* means to winnow; a small dustpan is called *cè*." Cuī states: "*Gǔcè* means to manipulate milfoil or drill tortoise shells." 《播精》 Pronounced as written; alternatively as *suǒ*, in which case the character should be 數. *Jīng*: Sīmǎ states: "To sift rice is called *jīng*." Cuī states: "*Bōjīng* means divining hexagrams and interpreting omens." *Gǔcè bōjīng* refers to fortune-telling. ◎ Qìngfān notes: *Jīng* should be 糈 in error. Guō Pú’s commentary on the *Nánshān Jīng* reads: "糈 is pronounced *xiān lǚ*; in present-day Jiāngdōng, the sound is *qǔ*." (*Shìwén* reads *qǔ*; the character should be 糈. The character 精 has no ancient pronunciation *qǔ* and was mistaken for 糈 due to their similar forms.) The *Shuōwén* states: "糈 means provisions." 《以食》 Pronounced *sì*.

【5】【Commentary】 (Relying) on their uselessness, they do not hide themselves away.

【Commentary】 When frontier regions are in turmoil and conscription seeks brave men, those maimed or infirm, unfit for battle, remain unafraid, rolling up their sleeves to roam freely. Relying on their uselessness, they do not flee or conceal themselves.

【*Shìwén*】《攘》 Pronounced *rú yáng*. 《臂于其闲》 Pronounced as written. Sīmǎ states: "闲 means within." Cuī writes it as *攘臂于其开*, stating: "开 means the space within a gate." 《窜匿》 Pronounced *nǚ lì*.

【6】【Commentary】 Because they are unfit for corvée labor.

【Commentary】 When the state imposes heavy corvée duties, those with chronic illnesses are exempted from service.

【7】【Commentary】 They are not conscripted for labor but receive gifts.

【Commentary】 Six *dàn* and four *dǒu* make a *zhōng*. When rulers pity the widowed and orphaned and show compassion for the poor and sick, those severely disabled receive abundant provisions. Thus, as Guō’s commentary states, they are not conscripted for labor but accept gifts.

【*Shìwén*】《三锺》 Sīmǎ states: "Six *hú* and four *dǒu* make a *zhōng*." ◎ Lú Wénchāo notes: "Old editions mistakenly wrote 六 as 斛; this has been corrected." 《不与》 Pronounced *yù*.

【8】【Commentary】 The spiritual person is of no use to things, yet all things attain their proper use. They ascribe merit and fame to the multitude of talents, merging with things without a trace. Thus, they avoid the harms of the human realm and abide in the substance of constant beauty—this is to fragment one’s virtue.

【Commentary】 To fragment one’s form is akin to forgetting form; to fragment one’s virtue is akin to forgetting virtue. How much more so for one who is maimed and infirm—this is truly forgetting form. Yet, not being a sage, they have not yet forgotten virtue. To forget virtue is to comprehend all things yet return wisdom to foolishness, to illuminate the Three Luminaries yet return brightness to obscurity. Thus, they accomplish without claiming, act without relying, ascribe merit and fame to the multitude of talents, and merge with things without a trace—this is to forget virtue. If forgetting form suffices to nourish the body and live out one’s years, avoiding the harms of the human realm, how much more so for one who forgets virtue! The superiority and inferiority, the shallowness and depth, cannot be spoken of in the same breath. Thus, we know that to fragment one’s virtue—this is the mark of the sage alone!

The *Shide Tang* edition omits the characters "而游" (1). The character "簸" is amended following the *Shide Tang* edition (2). According to the *Shiwen*, it does not mention the pronunciation "精" for "取"; its reference to "一音所" pertains to the character "播," hence it states that the character should be written as "數." Guo’s explanation is gravely mistaken (3). The character "恃" is amended following the commentary and the *Shide Tang* edition (4).

Confucius traveled to Chu, where the madman of Chu, Jie Yu, wandered near his gate and sang:
“O phoenix! O phoenix! How your virtue has declined!
The age to come cannot be awaited; the age past cannot be pursued.
When the world possesses the Dao, the sage brings completion;
when the world lacks the Dao, the sage preserves life.
In this present time, one can but barely escape punishment.
Blessings are lighter than feathers, yet none know how to bear them;
calamities are heavier than earth, yet none know how to avoid them.
Enough! Enough! Bestow virtue upon others no more!
Perilous! Perilous! To tread where lines are drawn upon the ground!
Beware the thorns! Beware the thorns! Do not harm my path!
My path is crooked and uneven—do not harm my feet!”

(1) *Commentary*: One should follow the times and proceed straightforwardly, fulfilling what is fitting in the convergence of circumstances. The rise and fall of the world are so vast as to be imperceptible, hence the question: *How has it come to this?*
*Subcommentary*: *How has it come to this?* means *How could it be thus?* *Traveled* means *went to*. At the time, Confucius journeyed from Lu to Chu and lodged at an inn. In Chu, there was a worthy man named Lu Tong, styled Jie Yu, who, knowing Confucius had traveled far to offer counsel, sang this song in mockery. *O phoenix! O phoenix!* Thus he lamented the sage, likening him to the auspicious bird that appears when the Dao prevails. When the world possesses the Dao, it should manifest; when it lacks the Dao, it should withdraw. How could one bear such sagely virtue and yet go to a declining and disordered state?

(2) *Commentary*: One should simply respond to what is fitting in the present moment.
*Subcommentary*: The age to come, though there may be a lord who embraces the Dao and could be served, is as fleeting as a galloping horse, and thus cannot be awaited. The age past, with its sage rulers like Yao and Shun, has long since transformed, and cannot be sought again. One should simply respond to what is fitting in the present moment, without need to gaze ahead or look behind.

(3) *Commentary*: Entrust it to its natural course, and principle will spontaneously bring about completion or preservation. Completion and preservation are not of my doing—how could they change their rhythm with order or chaos? When order prevails, one naturally seeks completion, thus abandoning completion without failure. When chaos reigns, one naturally seeks to preserve life, thus forgetting life without perishing.
*Subcommentary*: When a lord possesses the Dao and the age is enlightened, the sage spreads the Dao and enacts teaching, bringing completion to the world. When one encounters a benighted ruler and an age of decline, one may only preserve life and avoid harm, concealing one’s brilliance and obscuring one’s traces.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *How could they* is read *yu wei*. *Order and chaos* is read *zhi li*.

To align with the lower realm.

*Commentary*: Without peering ahead or glancing behind, one fully meets the present moment, merging obscurely with the age as one—only then can the wondrous accord be preserved and penal law be avoided.

*Subcommentary*: *Fang* means "to meet." In this time of ruin and disorder, precisely the age of the declining Zhou, one treads with caution and speaks with restraint, barely escaping punishment and execution. Yet to cling to traces and respond to summons—is this not delusion? These are the words of Jie Yu, mocking Confucius.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Jin* is read *jin*.

*Commentary*: Feet capable of walking are set free; hands capable of grasping are left unburdened. One listens to what the ears hear, sees what the eyes see, knows to halt at what lies beyond knowing, and ceases at what lies beyond ability. Employing what is self-employable, acting as is self-actable, indulging the nature within without the slightest attachment to what lies beyond one’s lot—this is the utmost ease of non-action. There has never been a case where non-action failed to preserve one’s nature and life; nor has there ever been a principle by which preserving nature and life did not bring good fortune. Thus, good fortune is nothing other than what was earlier called preservation—it is not borrowed from external things, nor does it bear the weight of a goose feather! To move in accord with one’s nature, never exceeding proper measure—this is the utmost ease under heaven. To lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself—this is the utmost lightness under heaven. Yet because knowledge injures the nature by its boundlessness, and the heart disturbs the true by its likes and dislikes, people abandon this utmost ease of non-action to pursue the utmost difficulty of action, discard this utmost lightness of self-lifting to take up the utmost burden of bearing others—this is the common affliction of the world.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Utmost ease* is read *zhi yi*. The same below.

"《知以》" is read as "wisdom."
"《欲恶》" is read *wulu*.

**6**
*Commentary*: When one lifts what is within one’s nature, even bearing ten thousand *jun* brings no sense of weight; when external things are imposed, though the burden weighs no more than a *zizhu*, one may yet be unequal to the task. What is internal is fortune—thus fortune is utmost lightness. What is external is misfortune—thus misfortune is utmost heaviness. That misfortune, so heavy, is never avoided—this is the world’s great delusion.

*Exegesis*: The faculties of seeing, hearing, knowing, and ability all have their limits. To remain within those bounds is to preserve life; to seek beyond them is to court premature death. Preserving life is thus fortune, while premature death is misfortune. Yet the fortune within one’s bounds is lighter than a goose feather, and though covetous strivers do not know it is already borne within them, the misfortune beyond one’s bounds is heavier than the earth itself, and deluded souls do not know to shun it from themselves. This is the common affliction of the vulgar world, and thus the burdens of Confucius and Lu are cited to illustrate its weight.

*Phonetic Gloss*: "《知避》" was formerly written as *置*, glossed as "to set aside." "《不胜》" is read *sheng*.

**7**
*Commentary*: To draw a line on the ground and bid a man follow it is to leave tracks that cannot be concealed; to possess one’s own [virtue] and confront things is to fail to merge with them. Thus the great person does not illuminate the self to dazzle others but lets others find their own illumination, does not impose virtue upon others but entrusts them to their own [virtue]. Thereby one pervades and unites the myriad things, mysteriously merging self and other, blending utterly with the world to share a single fortune both within and without.

*Exegesis*: *Yi* means "to halt." *Dai* means "danger."

Confucius was born at the end of the declining Zhou, in an age of dissipation and decadence. Clinging to the sagely traces, he traveled from state to state in response to summons, yet repeatedly met with rejection and slander. Thus it is said: to speak again and again is not as good as halting and refraining from action. If one were to employ the Five Virtues to govern the common people, setting aside the self to imitate things, it would surely bring danger to oneself—just as drawing lines on the ground to make tracks and bidding others run after them is but a waste of cunning labor, with no way to conceal them. To lead things with one’s own [virtue] follows the same principle.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Huadi* is read *huo*.

**8**
*Commentary*: *Miyang* means "lost yang." By losing yang and embracing solitude, not swayed by externals, one’s own conduct remains whole. If all under heaven preserve their own wholeness, then all who bear the name of "self" will be wholly preserved.

*Exegesis*: *Mi* means "lost." *Yang* means "brightness" or "movement." Lu Tong advised Confucius to conceal his traces and hide his brilliance, advocating the non-action of solitary reliance and forgetting the bright wisdom of responding to things. Thus, one halts within one’s proper bounds, without harming the wholeness of one’s life-conduct.

*Phonetic Gloss*: Sima [Qian] says: *Miyang* means "concealed yang," referring to feigned madness.

**9**
*Commentary*: To bend and complete one’s conduct is self-sufficient.

*Exegesis*: *Xi* means "emptiness." *Qu* means "compliance." Emptying the heart and following the nature of things, all who bear the name of "self" become self-sufficient.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Xiqu* is read *quni* (去逆反). Character books write it as □. *Guangya* says: □ means "bent."
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: According to the present *Shuowen* and *Guangya*, both write it as .
◎ Qingfan notes: *Xi* is written as  in the *Shiwen* cited by the *Exegesis*, which is correct. *Shuowen*:  means "bent conduct," from ⻌ and *zhi* phonetic. *Guangya*:  means "bent." *Jiyun* writes it as , saying: "It means a thing is bent. Also, it means to receive in a bent manner." *Yupian* reads it as *qiuji* (丘戟反). *Shuowen* further says: □ (read like *yin*) means "concealed," depicting a bent and hidden form. Originally written with □ as □, now written as .

*Collation*: (1) *Quewu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, where "one’s conduct" is written as *xiqu*. (2) "Govern" and "chaos" (治者乱者): the Shidetang edition omits the two *zhe* (者) characters. (3) The character *de* (德) is amended following the Zhao Jianyi edition.

The mountain tree brings ruin upon itself; the fat of the lamp consumes itself. The cassia is edible, so it is felled; the lacquer is useful, so it is cut. All people know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless.

**1**
*Exegesis*: *Kou* means "to fell." Trees in the mountains, such as catalpa and catalpa ovata, being of useful timber, are wantonly felled. Fat provides bright illumination, filling lamps and torches, and because it is useful, it is burned. Not only fat and wood—this applies to people as well.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Shanmu zikou ye gaohuo ziqian ye* is read *ziran* (子然反). Sima [Biao] says: The tree grows the axe-handle and thus is felled; the fat ignites fire and thus consumes itself. Cui [Zhuan] says: The mountain has trees, so it is burned by fire.

**2**
*Exegesis*: The heart of the cassia is pungent and fragrant, so it is hewn; the lacquer is used for vessels, so it is cut. Both are destroyed by the axe for their abilities.

*Commentary*: What is useful serves others as a function; what is useless preserves its own life. Those who cut their flesh and skin for the world are what the world knows. To allow the common people not to lose their own wholeness while both self and other attain harmony—this is so subtle that one remains unaware of its wonder within oneself.

*Exegesis*: Catalpa, cypress, orange, and pomelo; fat, fire, cassia, and lacquer—these are useful. The crooked-trunked tree, the tree of Shangqiu, the white-foreheaded ox, the high-nosed pig—these are useless. Yet the world all flaunts its talents as the use of what is useful, unaware that the fragmentation of its virtue is the use of what is useless. Thus Guo’s commentary says: What is useful serves others as a function; what is useless preserves its own life.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Menran* is read *moben* (亡本反).

**Book 2, Part 2**
**Inner Chapters: "Virtue Fills the Symbol" (Dechongfu) V**
**Inner Chapters: "Virtue Fills the Symbol" (Dechongfu) V**

**1**
*Commentary*: Virtue fills the inner, and things respond to the outer. Inner and outer merge mysteriously, so true as if a tally command, yet the physical form is forgotten.

*Phonetic Gloss*: Cui [Zhuan] says: This is the verification of abandoning form and discarding knowledge, filling it with virtue.

In Lu there was a man named Wang Tai who had lost his feet. Those who followed him in study were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Changji asked Confucius, saying: "Wang Tai is a man who has lost his feet, yet those who follow him in study divide Lu equally with you. He stands without teaching, sits without discussing, yet those who go to him empty return full. Is there truly a teaching without words, a formless shaping of the heart? What manner of man is he?"

**1**
*Annotation*: His surname was Wang, given name Tai, a native of Lu. To be amputated of one foot is called *wu* (兀). Though his form was maimed, his heart was truly empty and forgotten, thus his virtue filled the tally and he was placed at the head of this chapter.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Wu* (兀者): pronounced *wuhu* (五忽反), also read as *jie* (界). Li [Yun] says: to be amputated of a foot is called *wu*. Note: in seal script, the characters for *wu* (兀) and *jie* (介) are similar. *Wang Tai* (王骀): pronounced *tai* (台), Xu [Shen] also reads it as *dai* (殆). A person’s name.

**2**
*Commentary*: The number of disciples was comparable to that of Confucius.
*Annotation*: *Ruo* (若) means "like." Those who accompanied Wang Tai in travel and study were comparable in number to the followers of Confucius.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Cong zhi* (从之): read as written; Li [Yun] also reads it as *caiyong* (才用反). The same below. *Xiang ruo* (相若): *ruo* means "like"; the disciples were comparable in number to those of Confucius.

**3**
*Annotation*: His surname was Chang, given name Ji, a worthy man of Lu. Wang Tai traveled and taught, outwardly forgetting his bodily form while inwardly filling his virtue. Thus, those who followed him in study numbered three thousand, dividing Lu equally with the disciples of Confucius. Chang Ji, not yet comprehending his essence, was thus perplexed.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Chang Ji* (常季): Some say he was a disciple of Confucius.

**4**
*Commentary*: Each attained what they sought and was thus fulfilled.
*Annotation*: Though his disciples were many, he never lectured or expounded. Standing, he did not teach; sitting, he did not discuss. Those who came sought instruction with empty hearts and returned with full understanding. Alternate interpretation: those who came without learning or virtue also departed empty.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Li bu jiao zuo bu yi* (立不教坐不议): Sima [Biao] says: standing, he did not instruct; sitting, he did not discuss.

**5**
*Commentary*: He marveled that one with a maimed form could have a heart so full. For when the heart is whole, it leaves the body behind, forgets the five viscera, and wanders alone—yet the world cannot depart from it.
*Annotation*: He never taught his disciples through words or discussion. Though maimed in form, devoid of appearance, his profound Dao and supreme virtue filled his inner heart. There must have been something to this, for the multitude followed him.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Wu zang* (五藏): pronounced *cailang* (才浪反). The same below.

**6**
*Annotation*: Chang Ji marveled that one so maimed could gather such a vast following. To reveal the beauty of his filled virtue, he thus posed this question.

Confucius said: "This Master is a sage. I have merely lagged behind and not yet followed him. I shall take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me! Why limit it to Lu? I shall lead all under Heaven to follow him."

**1**
*Annotation*: Master Yan [Confucius] addressed Wang Tai as "Master," replying to Chang Ji: "Wang Tai is a sage who embodies the Dao. You fail to recognize such a man, hence your doubt. I have merely fallen behind and not yet gone to study under him. I shall revere him as my teacher and seek his instruction—how much more should those of later learning, inferior to me! To seek his guidance and hold his words in reverence is only fitting."

**Annotation on "丘也直后而未往耳"**
Li [Yu] says: "He merely remains behind the multitude and has not yet gone to study under him."

◎Qing Fan’s note: *Zhi* (直) here means "only." *Lüshi Chunqiu* ("Loyalty and Integrity"): "Only Wang Zijing adorned himself for him but did not kill him." Gao You’s commentary: *Zhi* means the same as *te* (特, "only"). In the *Odes* ("Yong Feng," "Bo Zhou"), *te* (特) is written as *zhi* (直). The *Records of the Grand Historian* ("Biography of Shusun Tong"): "I was only jesting," where the *Han History* writes *zhi* as *te*.

**2**
*Annotation*: When the spirit is whole and the mind complete, the body merges with things. One who merges with things cannot be distanced by all under Heaven—how could it be limited to a single state!
*Exegesis*: *Xi* (奚) means "why." "Why merely rely on the single state of Lu? I shall guide all within the realm to follow his abundant virtue, yet still fear I may not fully grasp his Way."

**Annotation on "能远"**
Yu Wan’s pronunciation.

Chang Ji said: "That man is maimed, yet his following surpasses even yours, Master. His distinction from the common is indeed vast. If this is so, how does he employ his mind uniquely?"
**1**
*Exegesis*: *Wang* (王) means "flourishing." *Yong* (庸) means "ordinary." *Xiansheng* (先生) refers to Confucius. That Wang Tai, though maimed, has disciples and followers more numerous than Confucius himself. Such strangeness and wonder surpass the ordinary—his difference from common people is surely great.
*Annotation*: *Er wang* (而王): Yu Wan’s pronunciation. Li [Yu] says: "to surpass." Cui [Yuan] says: "to rule as lord." *Qi yu yong yi yuan yi* (其与庸亦远矣): "He differs from the common." Cui [Yuan] says: *Yong* means "ordinary people."

**2**
*Exegesis*: *Ran* (然) means "thus." Wang Tai’s abundant virtue draws all things to him—what art does he employ in his mind? Chang Ji, not idly, raises this doubt.

Confucius said: "Death and life are indeed momentous, yet he does not change with them. Though heaven and earth should collapse, he would not be lost with them. He examines the flawless and does not shift with things, guiding the transformations of things while guarding their essence."
**1**
*Annotation*: Though people change daily, death and life are the greatest of changes.
**2**
*Annotation*: He moves with change, so death and life do not alter him.
*Exegesis*: Mountains and boats may vanish, firewood and fingers may flow away—though all things undergo such changes, none surpass death and life in magnitude. Yet Wang Tai’s mind merges with the Creator, shifting with transformations, his traces blending with the world. He moves with life and death, so change cannot change him.

**3**
*Annotation*: This is compliance.
*Exegesis*: *Yi* (遗) means "loss." Though the round heavens should topple and the square earth crumble, he remains unmoved by peril, thus never losing himself.
*Annotation*: *Sui tian di fu* (虽天地覆): Fang Fu’s pronunciation. *Zhui* (坠): also written as *dui* (队), Zhu Lei’s pronunciation. Li [Yu] says: "Even heaven and earth cannot change him—how much less life and death!"

**4**
*Annotation*: Clarifying the inherent constancy of nature and destiny.
◎Qing Fan’s note: *Wu jia* (无假) is likely a corruption of *wu xia* (无瑕, "flawless"), meaning he examines his own flawlessness, thus allowing things to shift without being enslaved by them. The *Huainanzi* ("Spiritual Essence") reads *shen hu wu xia* (审乎无瑕). *Xia* (瑕) and *jia* (假) share the same phonetic root, leading to frequent interchange. In the *Records of the Grand Historian* ("Hereditary House of Zheng"), "Fu Jia" (甫假) appears in the *Zuozhuan* as "Fu Xia" (傅瑕). In the *Rites* ("Tan Gong"), "Jian Jia" (肩假) appears in the *Han History*’s "Table of Ancient and Modern Persons" as "Gong Jian Xia" (公肩瑕), providing further evidence.

**5**
*Annotation*: Allowing things to shift of themselves.
*Exegesis*: His numinous mind rests in tranquility, his wondrous essence aligned with the true origin. United with the Dao, he is not swayed by things.

**6**
*Annotation*: Taking transformation as destiny, without opposition or conflict.

**7**
*Annotation*: Never departing from the ultimate perfection.

*Exegesis*: Comprehending the allotted destiny and becoming one with external things, he moves solely with destiny and things, acting without deviating from tranquility—thus he ever abides in his fundamental origin.

*Master Chang said, “What does this mean?”*
*Exegesis*: The meaning runs deep and is difficult to grasp; he seeks further clarification to resolve his doubts.

*Confucius said, “Viewed from what makes them different, the liver and gallbladder are as far apart as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what makes them the same, the myriad things are all one. One who is thus—unaware of what the ears and eyes deem fitting, yet roaming his mind in the harmony of virtue—sees only their unity and perceives no loss. To him, losing a foot is like shedding dirt.”*

*Annotation*: When natures of pleasure and suffering diverge, judgments of beauty and ugliness turn opposite.
*Exegesis*: Though the myriad things arise in profusion, they all return to emptiness and quiescence. Inverted distinctions—clinging to right and wrong—arbitrarily erect divisions within the profound Dao. How is this different from the liver and gallbladder, born of the same body, yet deemed as distant as Chu and Yue, separated by thousands of miles? Those who cleave to differences are all alike in this.

*Annotation*: Though what they deem beautiful differs, all share the capacity for beauty. If each cherishes what they find beautiful, then the myriad things share one beauty; if each affirms what they affirm, then the world shares one affirmation. Were one to emphasize differences and treat them as distinct, nothing in the world would not be different. Yet one of vast and boundless vision—who governs heaven and earth, encompasses the myriad things—knows that differences need not be treated as such. Thus, emphasizing what is shared, nothing in the world would not be the same. Further, knowing that sameness is not absolute, one embraces what is absent, and then right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, all dissolve into nothingness. From those of middling understanding down to the crawling insects, none fail to esteem themselves and disparage others, to find themselves beautiful and others ugly. Yet this is merely clarity about oneself and obscurity about others. As for those of profound penetration and merging insight, they illuminate the world through the world itself. If the world says, “I am not,” then they reveal that nothing in the world is not; if the world says, “That is,” then they reveal that nothing in the world is so. Without “is” and without “is not,” all blends into one—thus they ride change and follow transformation, encountering things without fear.

*Exegesis*: One of profound penetration and vast vision sees the two poles and the myriad things as a single finger or horse. Thus, he forgets himself and follows things, perfectly attuned to all beings. Yet those who see sameness see sameness, and those who see difference see difference. The ultimate discussion of the wondrous realm transcends both sameness and difference.

*Annotation*: What is fitting arises from what is not fitting. Without beauty and without ugliness, nothing is unfitting. Without anything unfitting, one forgets what is fitting.
*Exegesis*: The ears and eyes deem fitting what pertains to sounds and sights. Yet ordinary sentiments make distinctions, becoming mired in sounds and sights, thus producing what is fitting and unfitting, permissible and impermissible. But Wang Tai, merging all things and equating life and death, how could he harbor judgments of beauty and ugliness within the senses and their objects?

*Annotation*: Utterly forgetting what is fitting, nothing is not entrusted. Entrusting all without exception, nothing is unattained; nothing unattained, nothing is not harmonious. Thus, the mind wanders freely between virtue and the Dao, unbounded and unfettered, nothing not fitting, nothing not fittingly so.
*Exegesis*: Having merged all things and forgotten what the ears and eyes deem fitting, he roams the realm of virtue and the Dao, freely entrusting himself to the ultimate境.

*Annotation*: Embracing the wondrous mind of the utmost subtlety, nothing is not the same. Nothing not the same, then in life and death, transformation and change, nowhere is not oneself. Thus, life is the time of my gathering; death is my following. Time is my assembly; following is my dispersal. Though assembly and dispersal differ, both are mine—life is merely my moment, never a gain; death is also myself, never a loss. In the change of life and death, all is one. Having witnessed this oneness, one sheds all attachments, merges self and other, treats life and death as waking and dreaming, the body as a temporary lodging. Departing life is like casting off sandals; severing a foot is like discarding dirt—I have never seen this ensnare the mind.
*Exegesis*: *Wu shi* (物视), “seeing things,” means to regard things. Wang Tai equates life and death, levels self and other. Life is my time, yet he sees no gain; death is my following, yet he sees no loss. Regarding the myriad things, he merges them into one. Thus, though maimed of foot, he sees it as discarding dirt.

Common Season said: "He cultivates himself through his knowledge, attaining his mind through his mind. Having attained his constant mind, why should things gather most to him?"

*Exegesis*:
*[1] Note*: This suspects Wang Tai has not yet forgotten knowledge to preserve himself.
*Subcommentary*: "He" refers to Wang Tai. It means Wang Tai cultivates goodness and refines himself, yet still employs mind and knowledge. This suspects he has not yet forgotten knowledge to entrust himself to solitude.

*[2] Note*: This suspects he has not yet relinquished mind to attain himself.
*Subcommentary*: This suspects Wang Tai cannot forget concerns to entrust himself to attainment, still using mind to attain mind. Now, attaining the mind means no thought, no deliberation, forgetting knowledge, forgetting awareness—like dead ashes or withered wood, utterly devoid of emotion. Placed within the square inch of the heart, it arises beyond sight and hearing, equal to the two poles’ covering and bearing, compliant with the three luminaries’ illumination. It mingles with dust and filth without disturbing its spirit, treads upon hardship and obstruction without offending its thoughts. This is not attainment as attainment, yet attainment lies in non-attainment—this is true attainment. If one attains it through the artifice of mind and knowledge, it is not genuine attainment.

*[3] Note*: Attaining the constant mind is level passage. This suspects he does not achieve level passage to encounter things, thus always making things come to him.
*Subcommentary*: "Most" means to gather. If one can achieve emptiness, forgetting, and level equanimity, attaining the true constant mind, one should certainly harmonize with light and conceal brilliance, no different from the common. How could one stand apart from things, causing the multitude to return to him!

◎ My late father remarked: Knowledge manifests externally, while the mind abides within; through knowledge one attains the mind, following the external to preserve the internal. The mind is the unceasing true mechanism; the constant mind is the unerring fundamental substance. Through the mind one attains the constant mind, embodying the Dao through realization.

*Shuowen* states: "最 (*zuì*) means to encroach and seize," akin to saying nothing can encroach upon it. Guo Xiang’s punctuation is erroneous.
◎ Qingfan’s note on *Shuowen*: " (*cuì*) means to accumulate, composed of □ (pronounced *mò dí*) and 取 (*qǔ*), with 取 also indicating pronunciation." Xu Kai explains: "In antiquity, the character for 'gathering things' was written as ." As people commonly see 最 but rarely , all instances of  in texts and transmissions are written as 最.

Confucius said: "People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many stillnesses. Receiving its mandate from the earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant through winter and summer; receiving its mandate from heaven, only Shun alone is upright. Fortunate to rectify his own life, he thereby rectifies the lives of all. The proof of preserving the beginning lies in the substance of fearlessness. A single brave warrior, boldly entering the nine armies—even one who seeks fame and can compel himself to such extremes—still behaves thus. How much more so one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, merely lodges within the six bodily forms, mirrors the ears and eyes, knows what knowledge knows, yet whose mind never perishes! He will choose a day to ascend to the celestial realm, and people will follow accordingly. How could he deign to make things his concern!"

【一】*Note*: The stillness of water that enables reflection is not stillness pursued for the sake of reflection. Thus, when Wang Tai gathered the multitude, the people naturally turned to him—how could he have drawn them to follow him!

*Subcommentary*: "Mirror" means to reflect. Still water allows reflection because it is clear; Wang Tai gathered the multitude because he was serene. Still water has no intention to reflect things, yet things mirror themselves in it; Wang Tai had no intent to attract followers, yet the people naturally flocked to him.

*Exegesis*: "鉴" is pronounced *jiàn* (ancient *zhàn* rhyme). "Flowing water" in Cui’s version is written as *mèi* water, which he notes may also be written as *liú*. ◎ Qingfan’s note: "Flowing water" contrasts with "still water" in the text. Cui’s version as *mèi* is incorrect. In clerical script, *liú* (流) is sometimes written as □ (see the *Posterior Stele of Shi Chen’s Sacrifice at the Confucian Temple*), resembling *mèi* (沬) in form, hence Cui’s error. The *Huainanzi*’s *Shuoshan* chapter states, "People do not mirror themselves in *mèi* rain," with Gao’s commentary: "*Mèi* rain may also be written as *liú* puddles." This further confirms *mèi* as a corruption of *liú*.

【二】*Note*: If one acts deliberately, one cannot abide in the stillness of the myriad things.

*Subcommentary*: "Only" means alone. Only stillness—water’s inherent tranquility—can still the many stillnesses, that is, cause things to pause and reflect. This is akin to Wang Tai’s empty forgetfulness and serene quiescence, enabling him to contain and still the multitude. By this power, he became the gathering point for all.

【三】*Note*: The pine and cypress uniquely receive the concentrated qi of nature, thus standing as the finest among trees—not through any deliberate effort.

*Subcommentary*: All grasses and trees rely on the fertile earth. Yet those endowed with firmness and vigor, remaining undiminished through the harsh winter, like the pine and cypress that preserve their verdure year-round, receive qi naturally, without contrivance. Wang Tai’s gathering of the multitude follows the same principle.

【四】*Note*: Those who uniquely receive the upright qi of nature are exceedingly rare. Among lower beings, only the pine and cypress; among higher beings, only the sage. Thus, all that is not upright comes to seek rectification. If all things were verdant, the pine and cypress would hold no distinction; if all people were upright, none would admire the great sage and turn to him.

*Subcommentary*: Humans, endowed with the three powers, receive their mandate from heaven, their forms round-headed and square-footed, their kinds innumerable. Yet one who embodies uprightness and true qi, like Yu Shun, is unique—not by effort, but by natural disposition. Wang Tai’s alignment with the Dao follows the same principle. Guo’s note, "Among lower beings, only the pine and cypress; among higher beings, only the sage," refers to the fact that human heads are above (and removing the head causes death), while tree heads are below (and removing the root causes death). Thus, humans are called "upper beings," trees "lower beings." Upper beings consume those beside them, and those beside consume the lower. Lower beings are grasses and trees; those beside are insects and beasts.

【五】*Note*: He was fortunate to rectify himself, not to rectify others by rectifying himself.

*Subcommentary*: Receiving qi from the supreme, he rectified the Dao of life—not by intention, but by fortunate adherence to nature. Having rectified himself, he could rectify others. Rectifying self and others, benefiting self and others, his conduct was complete within and without—this is the great sage. Yu Shun exemplified this, as did Wang Tai. Yet Shun received the abdication of others, thus serving as the model.

【六】*Note*: He does not abandon fame yet leaves nothing unaddressed.

*Subcommentary*: "Proof" means completion, verification. The Son of Heaven commands six armies; the feudal lords, three—hence "nine armies." There may be one man, endowed with brave and martial qi, preserving the mind that guards the good beginning, verifying the integrity that fulfills the end, harboring a fearless will within, displaying a valiant bearing without. He enters the nine armies to seek fame and position, yet can subdue his heart to pursue reputation, forgetting life and death. How much more so Wang Tai! The state of embodying the Dao is described below.

*Exegesis*: "保始之征" (*bǎo shǐ zhī zhēng*): Li explains, "Proof means completion; beginning and end can be preserved and completed."

《Nine Armies》: Cui (version corrected to Li) states: "The Son of Heaven commands six armies; the feudal lords, three—together they form nine armies." Jianwen explains: "Military texts speak of attacking the nine heavens and seizing the nine lands, hence the term 'nine armies.'" *Ziyao* reads *yao* (遥) as *yao* (一遥反).

【Seven】*Note*: Profoundly embodying all without exception.
*Subcommentary*: Governing the two poles is called "officiating Heaven and Earth"; embracing the cosmos is called "storing the ten thousand things." Even a brave warrior entering the army, seeking only fame and position, can disregard life and death, forgetting them entirely. How much more so one who officiates the two poles and unites the ten thousand things, seeing death as life—is this not fitting!

【Eight】*Note*: What is called a temporary lodging.
*Subcommentary*: *Yu* (寓) means "to lodge." The six limbs refer to the head, torso, and four limbs. Wang Tai regards the singular body as insubstantial, penetrating the reality of the ten thousand existences. Thus he mingles the dust and filth of the vulgar world while lodging spirit within form—merely a transient encounter, how could it be a binding attachment!
*Exegesis*: *Six Limbs*: Cui explains: "Hands, feet, head, and body."

【Nine】*Note*: Humans employ ears and eyes, yet he employs ears and eyes without needing ears and eyes.
*Subcommentary*: *Xiang* (象) means "to resemble." Harmonizing light and dust, he seems to employ ears and eyes, yet does not require them.

【Ten】*Note*: When knowledge moves with transformation, there is nowhere it does not profoundly merge—this is the oneness of knowledge. When the heart flows with life and death, there is no time it is not alive—this is the heart that has never died.
*Subcommentary*: *One knowledge* is wisdom. *What is known* is the realm. The wisdom that knows illuminates the realm it knows; realm and wisdom merge profoundly, with no discrepancy between them. Thus knowledge and non-knowledge become one. Though he follows transformations in form and principle, the heart has never perceived death—how could there be room for stagnation in between!

【Eleven】*Note*: It is merely a matter of not missing the convergence; this person makes no choices, following Heaven’s course and acting in due time. Thus those who borrow and imitate are ranked highest by this standard.
*Subcommentary*: That Wang Tai—does he select auspicious days to ascend the mysterious Dao? Not at all; he simply abides in emptiness and forgetfulness, merging with it. The perfected person is without intention, like still water reflecting—yet the world’s borrowed and false men follow him by this means.
*Exegesis*: *Bi qie* (彼且) is read as written; Xu reads *ziyu* (子余反), and the same below. *Jiaren* (假人): Gu reads *guya* (古雅反), meaning "to borrow"; Xu reads *xia* (遐), connecting it to the previous phrase, with "person" belonging to the next clause.
◎Qingfan’s note: *Dengjia* (登假) is equivalent to *dengge* (登格). *Jia* and *ge* were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Book of Songs* writes *zouge* (奏格) or *zoujia* (奏假) as evidence. The *Erya* states: *Ge* (格), *zhi* (陟), *deng* (登), and *sheng* (升) all mean "to ascend." Though it says *deng* (登) and then *ge* (格), ancient texts often used reduplicative language. The *Chu Ci*’s *Li Sao* reads *zhi sheng huang zhi he xi* (陟升皇之赫戏兮), where *zhi* (陟) also means "to ascend."

【Twelve】*Note*: His tranquility and indifference preserve his wholeness.
*Subcommentary*: Only that Wang Tai, profoundly merging with the true and uniting with the Dao—illusory things naturally come to him, yet how could he ever take them as his own concern!

*Collation Notes*:

(2) Yu Yue notes that the following *zai* (在) is a corruption of *zheng* (正).
(3) *Quemiu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, where this sentence reads: "Yao and Shun alone are correct, [correct] at the head of the ten thousand things."
(4) The Tang manuscript writes *guan* (官) as *gong* (宫).

Shentu Jia, an amputee, studied under Bohun Wuren alongside Zichan of Zheng. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay." The next day, they again sat together in the same hall on the same mat. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now I am about to leave—can you stay, or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not yield—do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?"

【One】*Subcommentary*: His surname was Shentu, given name Jia, a worthy man of Zheng and an amputee. His surname was Gongsun, given name Qiao, style Zichan, a worthy minister of Zheng. Bohun Wuren was the honorific title of their teacher. *Bo* (伯) means "elder"; *hun* (昏), "obscure." His virtue stood as the elder of things, concealing his light as if obscure, utterly forgetting self and others—hence the name Bohun Wuren. Zichan and Shentu Jia both studied the mysterious Dao; though their paths diverged, they shared the same teacher. Thus these three are cited to illustrate the fullness of virtue.
*Exegesis*: *Shentu Jia*: Li explains: "Shentu is the clan; Jia, the given name."

The *Miscellaneous Chapters* renders this as "Màorén."

【Two】*Annotation*: He felt shame at walking alongside an amputee.
*Subcommentary*: Zichan, holding power at the center of the path, enjoyed glory, wealth, and nobility; Shentu Jia, his form maimed and incomplete, had lost all appearance of dignity. Though Zichan had studied under Bohun Wuren, he had not yet forgotten or relinquished such concerns, still clinging to honor and disgrace. Ashamed to be seen with one whose form was impaired, he took precautions in advance, ensuring they would not walk side by side.
*Exegesis*: *Amputee*: Pronounced *yuè*; also *wǔguā* in some readings.

【Three】*Annotation*: He questioned him directly, wishing to ensure they would not walk together.
*Subcommentary*: Zichan retained a sense of honor and disgrace, while Shentu had forgotten all distinctions of noble and base. Though words had been spoken earlier, Zichan had paid them no heed, so they still shared the same hall when at rest and the same seat when seated. Seeing this, Gongsun (Zichan) questioned him directly.

【Four】*Annotation*: He always considered his own position in government superior, so he simply said, "Are you equal to one in power?"—thus revealing his lack of deference.
*Subcommentary*: To *violate* is to avoid. Their paths of advancement differed, and their stations of noble and base were not the same. I hold power in court and am thus exalted and great; you are lowly, your form impaired—you ought to show me respect. Yet instead of yielding, you seek to place yourself on equal footing.
*Collation*: The Zhao Jianyi edition includes the character *yě* (也) after *xùn* (逊).
Shentu Jia said: "In the master’s gate, is it truly the case that one in power is held in such regard? Do you delight in your own power and thus place others behind you? I have heard it said: ‘When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, it is no longer bright. To dwell long with the worthy is to be without fault.’ Now, what you take as greatest is the master—yet you still speak in this way. Is this not a fault?"

【One】*Annotation*: This concerns the dwelling of virtue, not the reckoning of rank.
*Subcommentary*: The *master* is Bohun Wuren. The master’s gate of the Dao is profoundly enlightened to the myriad wonders, blending honor and disgrace, equalizing life and death. Is it certain that one who takes pride in holding power must be like this?
*Exegesis*: *Dwelling*: Pronounced *chǔ* (昌慮反).

【Two】*Annotation*: He mocked his pride in his position and desire to place himself before others.
*Subcommentary*: You still take pleasure in glory and boast of your governance, pushing others behind while seeking to place yourself first. With such intentions, how can you be said to study the Dao?
*Exegesis*: *Delight*: Pronounced *yuè*; the annotation reads the same.

【Three】*Annotation*: To serve a clear master yet still not shed one’s mean and stingy heart—this is truly a fault.
*Subcommentary*: *Mirror* means reflection. When a mirror is bright, dust and grime do not settle; if they settle, it is not a bright reflection. Likewise, dwelling long with a worthy person leaves no room for fault; if fault remains, that person is not truly wise. Now what you value as weighty and great is the master’s Dao. Yet the master’s Dao consists in withdrawing the self and emptying the mind, while you remain self-important, deeply at odds with its wondrous essence. To speak as you do—is this not a fault?

Zichan said: “Since you are already thus【One】, you still contend with Yao in goodness. Do you not reckon your virtue【Two】sufficient to reflect upon yourself?”
【One】*Annotation*: Thus means your form is impaired.
【Two】*Annotation*: This means you do not examine yourself but instead belittle those in office, wishing to stand alongside the virtuous. Weighing your virtue, it is not enough to remedy the fault of your impaired form.
*Subcommentary*: *Reflect* means to return. Shentu Jia’s form is impaired as it is, yet he does not know himself. Instead, he seeks to run abreast with me—this is truly contending with Yao in goodness. Though you possess virtue, how can it suffice in words? Even if virtue were used to mend impairment, it would not yet be restored.
*Exegesis*: *Contend in goodness*: Read as written.

*Collation*: (One) The missing character in the corrupted text is not present in the Li or Zhang editions.

Shentu Jia said: “Those who describe their faults to claim they should not have perished are many【One】; those who do not describe their faults yet should not have remained are few【Two】. Knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it as fate—only those with virtue can do this【Three】. To wander within Yi’s drawn bow.”

The center is the central ground; yet whether one hits it or not is a matter of fate.【Four】 People who mock my lack of wholeness with their own completeness have been many【Five】—I would flare up in anger at them【Six】. But when I came to the Master’s place, I would cast off that anger and return to myself【Seven】. Did I not know that the Master cleansed me with goodness【Eight】? For nineteen years I have wandered with you, Master, yet you have never once treated me as one who is maimed【Nine】. Now you wander with me within the bounds of form, yet you seek me beyond form—is this not an error【Ten】?”

【One】*Annotation*: Many describe their own faults to claim they should not have perished.
【Two】*Annotation*: Few remain silent about their faults, accepting that they should not have survived.
*Exegesis*: Those who parade their own merits, shifting blame to others and insisting they bear no fault—such people are many in the world. Those who do not display their faults, taking blame upon themselves and accepting that they should not live—such people are few. Zheng Zichan’s extravagance and self-regard were of this kind.
【Three】*Exegesis*: *If* means to yield. Though one’s form is inherently impaired by fate, and though one may possess knowledge and plans, there is nothing to be done—one can only accept and yield to it, and all one’s actions will then be fitting. Without great virtue, who could do this?
*Exegesis*: *Knowing there is nothing to be done* is read as written, or alternatively as *wisdom*.
【Four】*Annotation*: Yi was an ancient master archer. The range of his bow and arrows was called *gòu zhōng* (the drawn bow’s reach). When profit and harm contend, the world is all Yi—those who do not forget themselves, who forget knowledge and flow with things, all wander within Yi’s drawn bow. Even Zhang Yi’s outward striving or Shan Bao’s seclusion could not escape the central ground; whether one hits or misses the mark depends solely on fate. Yet the petty-minded each encounter their own circumstances, unaware that fate is simply as it is. Those who escape the harm of bow and arrow consider themselves skillful, delighting in their own cleverness. When they do not escape, they resent their own folly, their wills wounded and spirits humiliated—such people have not yet grasped the nature of fate. My life is not something I myself produce; thus, within a single lifetime, across a hundred years, in all my sitting and rising, walking and stopping, moving and resting, inclinations and aversions, emotions and nature, knowledge and abilities—all that I possess, all that I lack, all that I do, all that I encounter—none of it is truly me. It is simply the principle of things as they are. To arbitrarily generate joy or sorrow within this is to go against nature and lose oneself.
【Five】*Exegesis*: Yi was a skilled archer in the time of Yao. Wherever his arrows reached was called *gòu zhōng*. His arrows never missed; within the drawn bow’s reach, all was inevitably harmed—whether bird or beast, few escaped. Those who did were merely spared by fate; escape or failure to escape had nothing to do with skill. Those who do not forget their form or abandon their knowledge all wander within Yi’s drawn bow. Thus, Shentu Jia’s maimed foot was suddenly struck by one of Yi’s arrows, while Zichan’s whole body happened to escape the central ground. Since this was not a matter of human effort, there is no cause for self-satisfaction.
*Exegesis*: *Yi* is pronounced *yì*; Xu reads it as *hú xì*. A skilled archer; the Xia dynasty had one. Another says: the usurper of the Xia throne. *Gòu* is pronounced *gòu*, meaning to draw a bow. ◎My late father remarks: The *Yùpiān* states: *gòu* means to draw a bow or crossbow. The *Book of Han*, in the biography of Zhou Yafu, says: *gòu* bows and crossbows were drawn to full tension. To wander within Yi’s drawn bow is to encounter danger everywhere. Yet there is always a central ground; to position oneself as not hitting the mark is to place oneself on the bowstring or arrow shaft, where one may be struck by the very tension. In wandering, whether one hits or misses is merely a matter of chance—there is nothing to be done, and accepting it is fate. This speaks to the maimed foot not being one’s fault. *Central* is read as written. *Center* is pronounced *yú liáng*; the old reading was *yú cāng*. Guo says: the range of bow and arrow is called *gòu zhōng*. *Central ground* is pronounced *dīng zhòng*; below, *not hitting the mark* and the annotation’s *central ground*, *hitting or not hitting the mark*, are the same. *Shan Bao* is pronounced *shàn*.
【Five】*Annotation*: All this stems from not knowing fate and thus indulging in such mockery.
【Six】*Annotation*: Seeing their ignorance of fate, he grew angry—this too was ignorance of fate.
*Exegesis*: *Fúrán* expresses a violent, rebellious heart. Not knowing the mandate of heaven, people recklessly judge wholeness and impairment, praising their own intact forms while deriding the maimed. Such people are many in the world. Enraged by their ignorance, he flared up in anger—this too was ignorance of fate.
*Exegesis*: *Fúrán* is pronounced *fúfú*.
【Seven】*Annotation*: Seeing the perfected person’s knowledge of fate and forgetting of form, he cast off his former anger and returned to his true state.
*Exegesis*: When he went to Bohun’s place and received the teaching of wordlessness, he abandoned his former anger and returned to his original nature.
【Eight】*Annotation*: Did he not know that the Master cleansed him with the good Dao? Or was he able to reflect on himself? This was to forget his form and leave behind his burdens.
*Exegesis*: Having arrived at the Master’s gate and entered the empty chamber, he cast off his anger and returned to his usual self. Did he not know that the Master washed his heart with the water of goodness? Or was it his own nature that enabled him to reflect? In seeking the cause, he could not determine its source. This was to forget the heart of learning and leave behind its entanglements.
【Nine】*Annotation*: Because he forgot his form.

*Exegesis*: I wandered with Bohun in the Dao and virtue, thus able to exhaust the subtle essentials of yin and yang and reach the ultimate refinement of the profound principle. Having abandoned knowledge and forgotten form, how could I be aware of my own mutilation!

*Explication*: The *Zhiwu Jie* edition also writes 兀 as 兀; both are acceptable.

【Ten】*Annotation*: The bodily form is external; one’s virtue resides within. Now you wander with me in virtue, not in bodily form—yet you seek my external adornments. Is this not mistaken!

*Exegesis*: As Guo’s annotation states: “The bodily form is external; one’s virtue resides within. Now you wander with me in virtue, not in bodily form—yet you seek my external adornments. Is this not mistaken!” This note requires no further explanation.

*Explication*: 《子索》 appears in one hundred variant readings in the *Collected Commentaries*. The annotation is the same.

*Collation*:
(1) The *Shi De Tang* edition writes 众.
(2) The *Quewu* edition, citing Zhang Junfang’s text, adds “吾之自寤邪” after 邪.
(3) The *Shi De Tang* edition omits 矣.
(4) The Zhao Jianyi edition adds 我 after 知.
(5) The Zhao edition omits 也.
(6) The *Shi De Tang* edition omits 矣.
(7) The *Shi De Tang* edition writes 遗 as 遣 and omits 矣.
(8) 能 is supplied based on the annotation.
(9) The present edition writes 兀.
(10) 好 is amended based on the annotation.

Zichan abruptly changed his expression and altered his demeanor, saying, “Sir, you need not elaborate further!”

*Annotation*: Having awakened, he found further words superfluous.

*Exegesis*: 蹴然 describes a look of startled shame. Zichan had not yet forgotten attachments or relinquished desires, often placing himself before others. Once reproached, he was struck with alarm, altering his haughty bearing to an ugly countenance. Realizing his error, he saw no need for further explanation.

*Explication*: 《蹴》 is read in six variant pronunciations. 《乃称》 is read as written, meaning “to raise” or, alternatively, as *cheng* (尺证反).

There was in Lu a mutilated man, Shushan Wuzhi, who came to see Confucius on his heels.

Confucius said, “You were not careful, and already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?”

Shushan Wuzhi, the mutilated man, replied, “I merely failed to recognize priorities and recklessly used my body—thus I lost my foot. Yet now I come, for what is more honorable than the foot still remains. Therefore, I strive to preserve it whole. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without omission. I took you, Master, for Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would be thus?”

*Annotation*: 踵 means "frequently."

*Exegesis*: Shushan is his courtesy name. 踵 means "frequently." Though maimed, this man of Lu retained his desire to learn, coming repeatedly to seek a teacher and inquire after the Dao. Lacking toes, he was thus named.

*Explication*: 《叔山无趾》 is read as *zhi* (止). Li [Yun] says: Shushan is his surname, Wuzhi his courtesy name. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: "courtesy name" is likely an error for "surname." 《踵》 is read *zhong* (朱勇反). Xiang and Guo say: "frequently." Cui says: lacking toes, he walked on his heels. 《见》 is read *xian* (贤遍反).

*Exegesis*: "You were not careful in cultivating yourself, transgressed the law, and previously suffered punishment—enduring hardship and calamity, your body maimed to this degree. Now you come seeking further instruction—what can be done?"

*Explication*: 《子不谨前》 is a complete sentence. Alternatively, the sentence may end at *jin* (谨).

*Annotation*: One who lives naturally allows principle to unfold of itself. Simply doing nothing and letting life take its course—this is valuing the body and recognizing priorities. But to forget one’s natural life, to be cautious and self-important—this is recklessly using the body without recognizing priorities. Thus the five organs war within, and hands and feet are maimed without.

*Annotation*: Losing one foot is not enough to diminish one’s virtue. Clearly, the body is but a temporary lodging.

*Annotation*: Abandoning self-importance and caution, letting life unfold naturally—this is striving to preserve it whole.

*Exegesis*: Wuzhi was deferential in conduct, valuing virtue and slighting the body. He sought only to borrow fame, not knowing to prioritize the Dao of preserving life whole. Thus he transgressed the law and suffered mutilation. Though his form was damaged, his virtue remained—so he came repeatedly, striving to preserve his virtue whole. Comparing virtue to the body, he said what was more honorable than the foot still remained. *Cun* (存) means "to remain."

*Explication*: 《去其》 is read *qu* (羌吕反).

*Annotation*: Heaven does not act for the sake of covering, yet it always covers; Earth does not act for the sake of bearing, yet it always bears. If Heaven and Earth acted for the sake of covering and bearing, they would rest at times. If a boat could sink yet act to keep a man afloat, it would sink at times. Thus, when things act for a purpose, they cannot fully sustain life.

*Explication*: 《不为》 is read *wei* (于伪反). The same applies to *bu wei* (不为) and *er wei* (而为) below.

*Annotation*: To reproach him for not being careful is to fall short of Heaven and Earth.

*Exegesis*: Heaven and Earth nurture all, covering and bearing without partiality. The sage’s virtue aligns with these two forces—surely he should be universally inclusive, not rejecting the maimed. How could the Master’s heart of saving all be thus? Confucius said, “I am indeed crude.”

*Exegesis*: What Confucius spoke of were but the traces of the sages. Wuzhi sought to learn the Dao of preserving life whole. Answering a shallow question with depth revealed his crudeness.

Wuzhi departed. Confucius said, “Disciples, take heed! Though Wuzhi is mutilated, he still strives to learn and make amends for past wrongs. How much more should one of whole virtue do so!”

*Annotation*: Hearing what he heard and departing, he preserved his non-action.

*Exegesis*: *Fuzi* (夫子) refers to Wuzhi. *Hu* (胡) means "why." Confucius, feeling his own crudeness and much ashamed, humbled himself to Wuzhi, inviting him in to expound what he had heard of the inner Dao. Yet after long dwelling in a thatched hut and offering straw dogs repeatedly, Wuzhi, disliking the words, departed in silence.

*Annotation*: One of whole virtue forgets life upon birth.

*Exegesis*: *Mian* (勉) means "to encourage."

Though Wuzhi is maimed and crippled, he yet preserves life whole in truth, mending his losses and repenting his past conduct. How much more should the worthy and the gentleman, whose form and virtue are both complete, forget life upon birth and let virtue fill them within! Such is the model for disciples to emulate.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Qianxing* (前行) is read *meng* in the lower tone.

Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, “Is Confucius yet far from the perfected person? Why does he so deferentially take you as his teacher? He seeks to make his name known through strange and wondrous marvels, unaware that the perfected person regards these as his own fetters.”

*Annotation*: He found it strange that Confucius should again study under Lao Dan.
*Exegesis*: *Binbin* (宾宾) describes a reverent and diligent demeanor. The man of profound virtue exhausts principle and fathoms the subtleties, forgetting words and abandoning learning, following his nature and born with knowledge. Yet Confucius clings to written texts and adheres to the traces of the sages, deferentially and diligently inquiring of Lao Dan about ritual. By your measure, he is not yet like the perfected person—why then does he study under you?

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Yu Lao* (语老) is read *yuju* in the falling tone. *Binbin* (宾宾): Sima Biao says it means “a reverent appearance.” Zhang Yi says it means “to esteem the worthy.” Cui Zhuan says it means “to show partiality.”

**Chapter Six: The Great and Venerable Teacher**
*Annotation*: Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things abundant, what they honor and take as their teacher is the non-hearted.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Da zongshi* (大宗师): Cui Zhuan says, “To abandon form and forget life is to take this as the great and venerable teaching.”

One who knows what Heaven does and what man does has reached the utmost. One who knows what Heaven does is born of Heaven; one who knows what man does uses what his knowledge knows to nourish what his knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling his Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.

*Annotation*: One who knows what Heaven and man do knows that both are natural. Thus he inwardly releases his person and outwardly darkens himself to things, becoming one with the mysterious multitude, letting things take their course so that nothing is left undone.
*Exegesis*: *Tian* (天) refers to spontaneity. *Zhi* (至) means “to reach the ultimate.” What Heaven does includes the three luminaries’ waxing and waning, the four seasons’ birth and killing, the unfolding and rolling up of wind and clouds, and the cold and warmth of thunder and rain. What man does includes grasping with the hands and walking with the feet, seeing with the eyes and hearing with the ears, knowing skill and clumsiness, and all that he enacts. Knowing what Heaven does, one sees that all is self-so, not the result of cultivation or effort, nor dependent on knowledge or power. Thus he inwardly releases his person and outwardly darkens himself to things, gazing upon the vastness with equanimity, becoming one with the mysterious multitude, exhausting principle and fulfilling his nature—hence he is called “utmost.”

*Annotation*: *Tian* (天) refers to spontaneity. The doer cannot do, and what is done is self-done; the knower cannot know, and what is known is self-known. Self-known is not known, and not-knowing is where knowledge arises; self-done is not done, and not-doing is where doing arises. Doing arises from not-doing, so not-doing is the master; knowledge arises from not-knowing, so not-knowing is the origin. Thus the true person abandons knowledge yet knows, does not act yet acts, is born spontaneously, attains through sitting in forgetfulness, so that knowledge is called “cut off” and doing is said to “depart.”
*Exegesis*: Clouds move and rain falls, rivers and mountains, valleys and streams—these are not the work of man but are born of Heaven. Knowing what is known, all is spontaneous. This explains the earlier “knowing what Heaven does.”
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Tian er sheng* (天而生): Xiang Xiu and Cui Zhuan read it as *shi er sheng* (失而生). *Zhi cheng* (知称) is read *chizheng* in the falling tone.

*Annotation*: Man’s life is a form of seven feet, yet the Five Constants are all present, so even this small body encompasses Heaven and Earth to sustain it. Thus Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, all that exists, cannot be without one another for a single day. If one thing is lacking, the living have no means to live; if one principle is not fulfilled, one’s Heaven-appointed years have no way to be completed. Yet what the body possesses, knowledge may or may not know; what principle contains, action may or may not enact. Thus what knowledge knows is little, while what the body possesses is much; what action does is small, while what principle contains is vast. Those above cannot measure it and seek to make it complete. What man knows need not be the same, and what he does must not differ—difference breeds artifice, and where artifice is complete, the true is never preserved. Some love knowledge and tirelessly exhaust their limbs, but what they love is no more than a branch, and the root is harmed along with it—this is using what they know to harm what they do not know. As for the fullness of knowledge, one who knows what man does knows its limits, so he acts without forcing; one who knows what man knows knows its bounds, so he uses it without excess. Thus he does not use the boundless to exhaust himself, and within his single body, what he knows and what he does not know meet in darkness and are both preserved—this is using what he knows to nourish what he does not know.
*Exegesis*: What man does refers to the functions of his four limbs and hundred parts. What knowledge knows refers to the eye knowing colors, taking color as what is known. What knowledge does not know refers to the eye knowing colors but not knowing sounds, taking sound as what is not known. Yet the eye sees for the hands and feet, the feet walk for the ears and nose—though they do not intentionally aid one another, their assistance is accomplished. Thus the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, four limbs, and hundred parts serve one another, each with its own office.

The brightness and darkness of the heart, too, have their limits—using what lies within its proper bounds, it never forces knowledge. Thus he employs what his knowledge knows to nourish what his knowledge does not know, and so fulfills his Heaven-appointed years without untimely demise. One who can do this may be called one whose knowledge is most excellent.

*Exegesis*: 《不丧》*xī làng* (息浪), same below. 《或好》*hū bào* (呼报), same below. 《不强》*qí liǎng* (其两).

Yet there is still affliction. For knowledge depends on something else to be fitting, and what it depends on is inherently unstable. How can we be certain that what I call Heaven is not truly man, or that what I call man is not truly Heaven?

*Annotation*: Though knowledge may be excellent, it does not compare to forgetting knowledge and entrusting oneself to Heaven, which is free from affliction.
*Exegesis*: Though knowledge may be most excellent, it still entails affliction—it does not compare to forgetting knowledge and following the solitary Dao.
*Annotation*: Knowledge cannot be without "can" or "cannot," and so it must depend on something. But one who entrusts himself to Heaven and lives accordingly meets things as they come and is fitting.
*Annotation*: What knowledge depends on is inherently unstable.
*Exegesis*: Knowledge must confront its object; without an object, it cannot be fitting. Since objects arise and perish unpredictably, knowledge too is contingent and impermanent. Only when both object and knowledge are forgotten, when subject and object are both transcended, can one be without "can" or "cannot"—and only then is there no affliction.
*Annotation*: My life has its limits—this is Heaven. The heart desires to extend it—this is man. Yet what man calls "man" is in truth nothing other than Heaven. Heaven is the natural; all things are natural. Thus order and chaos, success and failure, encounter and non-encounter are not the work of man but all arise naturally.
*Exegesis*: Whether we look near to the body or far to things, the functioning of knowledge is nothing but the natural. Thus Heaven and man are ultimately one in principle. Call it Heaven, and it is man; call it man, and it is Heaven. How could the common run understand this truth? The "I" here refers to Zhuangzi himself—one who merges Heaven and man, blending self and other.
*Exegesis*: 《庸讵》*qí shù* (其庶). 《则治》*zhí lì* (直吏).

Only with the true person does true knowledge arise. What is the true person? The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not dominate success, and did not scheme for scholars. Such a one, when he errs, feels no regret; when he is fitting, feels no self-satisfaction. Such a one climbs high without trembling, enters water without getting wet, enters fire without feeling heat. This is how knowledge ascends to union with the Dao.

*Annotation*: Only with the true person does all knowledge in the world attain its truth and remain unconfused.
*Exegesis*: The sage, in perfect union with the true and the Dao, forgets self and abandons things. With such sagely virtue, true knowledge arises—thus the true person is one, free from affliction. The form of the true person is described below.
*Exegesis*: A hypothetical question to clarify the meaning.
*Annotation*: If he does not resist even the few, then what he desires will be many.
*Exegesis*: "Few" means scarcity. Drawing from the ancients to guide the present, he exalts the root and restrains the branches, empties his heart to follow things, and fully complies with the myriad beings. Even if what comes is meager, he never resists.
*Annotation*: He does not rely on his achievements to put himself before others.
*Exegesis*: Acting without reliance, growing without domination—how could he dominate success and seek to put himself before others?
*Annotation*: He lets his heart proceed directly, and scholars naturally gather—this is not achieved through scheming.
*Exegesis*: With emptiness and tranquility, scholars gather of themselves—this is not the result of deliberate scheming.
*Exegesis*: 《不谟》*mò hū* (没乎).
*Annotation*: He simply preserves what is fitting without erring—he does not weigh gain and loss in his heart.
*Exegesis*: When the time has passed, he feels no regret; when his lot is fitting, he does not take it as a personal achievement.
*Exegesis*: *Yú Yuē* says: "To err" means to make a mistake in affairs. "To be fitting" means to act appropriately. Ordinary people, when they err in affairs, feel regret; when they act appropriately, they take it as a personal achievement. The true person is not like this. Hence it is said: when he errs, he feels no regret; when he is fitting, he feels no self-satisfaction. The main text clearly speaks of "erring," but Guo Xiang’s annotation says "preserves what is fitting without erring," which is incorrect.
*Annotation*: When knowledge ascends to the Dao, it is as distant as this. The principle is inherently complete—it is not that he fears death. Thus when the true person walks on land, it is not to avoid getting wet; when he distances himself from fire, it is not to escape heat; when he does not err, it is not that he deliberately acts fittingly. Though he does not take heat as heat, he never rushes into fire; though he does not take wetness as wetness, he never steps into water; though he does not take death as death, he never loses his life. Thus life—does it live itself by living? Achievement—does it achieve itself by achieving? One who entrusts himself to things and yet lacks nothing is a true person—how could he have fixed intentions toward what he encounters?
*Exegesis*: "Trembling" means fear; "wet" means damp; "ascends" means rises; "attains" means reaches.

The true person comprehends the non-duality of life and death, embodying the oneness of safety and peril—thus he enters water and fire without the slightest concern, ascends heights and treads perilous paths without the least alarm. The one of true knowing possesses this power, ascending to the profound Dao, and thus attains such mastery.

*Exegesis*:
- "Not trembling" (*buli*): pronounced *li*.
- "Not wet" (*buru*): *er zhu* (fanqie).
- "Ascends" (*dengjia*): *geng bai* (fanqie), meaning "to reach."
- "Distances from fire" (*yuanhuo*): *yu wan* (fanqie).
- "Fixed intentions" (*yougai*): *gu ai* (fanqie).

The true persons of antiquity:
- In sleep, they did not dream;
- In waking, they knew no sorrow;
- In eating, they found no savor;
- In breathing, their breath was deep and profound.

The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the common person’s breath barely passes the throat. Those who are cramped and constrained—when they speak, their words choke in their throats like vomit. The deeper one’s cravings and desires, the shallower one’s celestial mechanism.

The *Exegesis* states: Dreams arise from deluded thoughts and wandering emotions. The true person, free from emotional entanglements and devoid of discursive thought, thus remains serene in sleep, undisturbed by dreams. Upon waking, they abide in constant contentment, untouched by sorrow.

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "In waking" (*qi jue*): pronounced *gu xiao*.

*Annotation*:
3. "They found no savor": They ate merely to sustain life.

*Exegesis*:
Dwelling among the common folk, they partook of food without attachment to flavor, thus remaining unaware of its sweetness.

*Annotation*:
4. "Reaches the heels": The breath originates from the very root.

*Exegesis*:
The heel is the base of the foot. The true person’s mind and nature are harmonious and unhurried, their wisdom steady and still. Even their breathing is slow and measured, rising from the heels—this illustrates its depth and tranquility.

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "Deep, deep" (*shen shen*): Li explains: the appearance of inner breathing.
◎ Jia Shifu says: To abide in the realm of no-breath, and thus draw breath deeply—calm and still, without egress or ingress, without coming or going—such that pent-up anger cannot bind, and deep desires cannot assail. The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera all remain untouched by its circulation, and in retreat, it lodges in the heels, nourishing itself in the profound, vast, and boundless.
- "With the heels" (*yi zhong*): pronounced *zhang yong*.
Wang Muya says: The breath arises from the heels, pervading the entire body and penetrating deeply.

*Annotation*:
5. "Their qi is not smooth and flowing."

*Exegesis*:
*Yi* (嗌) means the throat; *wa* (哇) means vomiting. Ordinary people, their minds restless and competitive, speak and breathe only through the throat. Agitated in spirit and hurried in breath, they cannot attain deep stillness. Bent and constrained, their qi fails to harmonize, and their throats constantly feel as though choked with vomit.

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "With the throat" (*yi hou*): Xiang explains: panting breath, regulated by the throat, caused by the pursuit of desires.
- "Their *yi*" (*qi yi*): pronounced *yi*. Guo pronounces it *e*, meaning the throat.
- "Like vomiting" (*ruo wa*): pronounced *huo wa* (fanqie), or *hu gua*, or *yujia* (fanqie). Cui reads it *yu jia* (fanqie), meaning "bound," as in qi obstructed in the throat. Simplified Text says: *wa* means vomiting.

*Annotation*:
6. "Deeply rooted in tranquility, they return to oneness and desirelessness."

*Exegesis*:
Those who indulge in sensory pleasures and are burdened by deep desires possess only shallow celestial mechanisms. Had their wisdom been profound and far-reaching, how could this be so?

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "Their desires" (*qi shi*): pronounced *shi zhi*.

The true persons of antiquity:
- Did not rejoice in life, nor abhor death;
- Their departure brought no delight, their return no resistance;
- They came and went with effortless ease.
- They did not forget their origin, nor seek their end;
- They accepted what came and rejoiced in it, then forgot and returned to it—
This is called not using the mind to abandon the Dao, nor using human effort to assist Heaven.
This is called the true person.

*Annotation*:
1. "They merged with transformation itself."

*Exegesis*:
Qi gathers to form life, and life is my present state; qi disperses in death, and death is my natural course. Having merged with transformation, they harbored no joy or aversion.

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "Rejoice in life" (*yue sheng*): pronounced *yue*.
- "Abhor death" (*wu si*): pronounced *wu lu*.

*Annotation*:
2. "They remained composed and yielded to it."

*Exegesis*:
When the time came to be born, they felt no joy; when the time came to die, how could they resist or avoid it?

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "No delight" (*bu xin*): pronounced *xin*, or *qi*.
- "No resistance" (*bu ju*): also written as *ju*, pronounced *ju*.
Li explains: Delight in emergence leads to striving for life; resistance to entry leads to aversion to death.

*Annotation*:
3. "Entrusted to the supreme principle, they came and went without difficulty."

*Exegesis*:
*Xiaoran* (翛然) means unencumbered. Freely transformed, they roamed in accord with principle. Though they came and went in life and death, they harbored no attachment.

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "Xiaoran" (*xiao ran*): pronounced *xiao*. Also written as *shu*. Xu pronounces it *shu*; Guo and Cui read it *jiu*. Xiang explains: *xiaoran* means naturally and effortlessly so. Guo and Cui say: the appearance of coming and going without difficulty. Sima explains: *shu* means swift. Li concurs.
◎ Lu Wenchao says: The old text mistakenly wrote *jiu* as *dong*; corrected here following the Song edition.

*Annotation*:
4. "They forgot both beginning and end in transformation—how could they merely forget life and still seek meaning in death?"

*Exegesis*:
Beginning means birth; end means death. Having transcended both birth and death, they were free from attachment. How could they merely forget life while still seeking meaning in death? They regarded beginning and end as equal, finding contentment in whatever they encountered.

*Phonetic Gloss*:
- "Still seek" (*you fu*): pronounced *fu you*. Same below.

*Annotation*:
5. "They did not question what they received, but met all with equanimity."

*Exegesis*:
They rejoiced in whatever they encountered.

*Annotation*:
6. "Their return was not guided by knowledge—this was the ultimate."

*Exegesis*:
They returned to the state before birth.

*Annotation*:
7. "Humans are born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, they stir—this is the desire of nature. When things ceaselessly move humans, and humans endlessly pursue desires, Heaven’s principle is extinguished. The true person knows that using the mind opposes the Dao, and assisting Heaven harms life, so they do not act thus."

*Exegesis*:
"This is called" refers to the preceding passage, summarizing its meaning. *Juan* (捐) means to abandon. The foregoing wisdom, which forgets life, can be said to discard the mind of acceptance and rejection, abandoning the empty and unobstructed Dao. It also does not employ human distinctions to augment Heaven’s natural endowment. Those who can do this are called true persons.

**Exegesis of Text**:
*Juan* (捐): Xu pronounces it with the *quan* (全) rhyme. Guo writes it as *yi* (揖), with the *ru* (入) rhyme. Cui says: "Some write it as *ji* (楫), the means by which a boat is rowed."
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: "*Yi* (揖) was formerly miswritten as *ji* (楫). Given that below it says 'some write it as *ji*,' here it should be *yi*."
◎ Yu Yue says: "The character *juan* (捐) is erroneous. The *Exegesis of Text* states: 'Guo writes it as *yi*, Cui says some write it as *ji*, the means by which a boat is rowed'—this meaning is even more incomprehensible. I suspect all are errors for *bei* (偝). *Bei* is the character *bei* (背, 'to turn one’s back'), hence Guo’s commentary says, 'The true person knows that using the mind turns one’s back on the Dao, and assisting Heaven harms life.' Thus, the version Guo relied upon originally wrote *bei*."
*Ze bei* (则背): Pronounced *pei* (佩).

**Collation**:
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *shou* (受) as *ai* (爱).
(2) "Not using the mind to *juan* (捐) the Dao" should be "not using the mind to *sun* (损) the Dao." *Sun* (损, 'to diminish')—in the present edition, the character is damaged and mistakenly written as *juan* (捐). The *Suoyin* commentary to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the "Biography of Jia Yi," correctly cites this passage as *sun* (损).

If this is so, then:
Their minds are steadfast,
Their demeanor serene,
Their brows broad and unadorned.
Chill as autumn,
Warm as spring,
Their joy and anger flow with the four seasons,
Harmonizing with things as is fitting, yet none know their limit.

**Annotation**:
1. "Their minds are steadfast": Where they dwell, they find peace as their resolve.
**Exegesis**: If, as previously stated, one does not *sun* (损) the Dao with the mind, this is to harbor resolve and strength, enabling such a state. Thus, the *Laozi* says, "Those who act with strength possess resolve."
◎ Jia Shifu says: Guo Xiang’s commentary, "Where they dwell, they find peace as their resolve," should read "their minds are steadfast." The *Shuowen* states: "Resolve (*zhi*, 志) is that toward which the heart (*xin*, 心) directs itself." The *Book of Documents* says, "Like archery, it has its aim"—Kong’s commentary explains: "As in archery, which has its aim, the mind directs itself toward hitting the mark." In Buddhist texts, the nature and characteristics are thus and unchanging, eternally abiding—this is what is meant by "their minds are steadfast."
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Shuowen* does not contain a seal script for *zhi* (志); the citation likely comes from the *Zilin* or other character dictionaries.
**Exegesis of Text**: "Their minds are steadfast" should be "their minds forget." *Zhi* (志) is a graphical error for *wang* (忘).

2. "Their demeanor serene": Though they act, they do not disrupt tranquility.
**Exegesis of Text**: *Rong* (容) is also written as *ji* (寂). Cui’s edition writes it as *jia* (家). Lu Wenchang notes: "The old edition mistakenly wrote *jia* (家); now corrected. See the preceding discussion. The present text writes it as *ji* (寂)."

3. "Their brows broad and unadorned": *Kui* (頯) describes the appearance of great simplicity.
**Exegesis**: *Sang* (颡) means the forehead. *Kui* (頯) describes great simplicity. When the true person descends into the world, their vital essence stands apart from the ordinary. Not only is their wisdom bright and empty, their resolve vast and universal—their bearing is also refined and elegant, their appearance dignified and solemn. The "sun-moon angles" (of physiognomy) belong to this category.
**Exegesis of Text**: *Qi sang* (其颡): Cui pronounces it *xidang* (息党). Cui says: "It means *tu* (突)." *Kui* (頯): Xu pronounces it with the *qugui* (去轨) rhyme; Guo with the *kudui* (苦对) rhyme; Li pronounces it *qiu* (仇), also *kui* (逵), meaning "authority." Wang says: "Unadorned and plain." The *Xiang* edition writes it as *kuang* (□), stating: "*Kuang* (□) describes great simplicity." The *Guangya* says: "*Kuang* (□) means great," pronounced *wuzui* (五罪).

4. "Chill as autumn": They do not kill things to display authority.
**Exegesis of Text**: *Qiran* (凄然): Pronounced *qixi* (七西).

5. "Warm as spring": They do not give life to things out of benevolence.
**Exegesis of Text**: *Nuanran* (暖然): Pronounced *xuan* (暄); Xu pronounces it *kuanwan* (况晚).

6. "Their joy and anger flow with the four seasons": Those who embody the Dao and harmonize with change share the warmth and severity of cold and heat, yet never act with intent. Nevertheless, they manifest warmth and severity, the rhythms of life and death—thus, their joy and anger are named by analogy.
**Exegesis**: The sage is without intent; responding to stimuli, they act accordingly, adapting kindness or severity to the moment. Like autumn’s descent of frost, they are not intentionally stern; like spring’s nurturing of life, they do not deliberately bestow kindness. Thus, the true person moves like thunder, stirs like wind, flourishes like trees in bloom—covering and supporting, they align with the two poles; their joy and anger flow with the four seasons.

7. "Harmonizing with things as is fitting, yet none know their limit": Without intent toward things, they do not disrupt what is fitting for them. When nothing is unfitting, none can fathom their limit.
**Exegesis**: The true person engages with the world, responding to stimuli and adapting to the times. In their interactions with things, they always act fittingly. Yet with a mind empty and compassionate, they constantly aid others, their measure equal to the great void—thus, none know their limit. Therefore, when the sage employs military force, they may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. Their beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet they do not act out of love for others. Thus, those who delight in connecting with things are not sages; those who show partiality are not benevolent; those who rely on timing are not worthy; those who do not communicate benefit and harm are not gentlemen; those who act for fame and lose themselves are not scholars; those who sacrifice themselves without authenticity do not serve others. Men like Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Jita, and Shentu Di—these are those who serve others’ service, follow others’ paths, yet do not follow their own.
**Exegesis**:
(1) Yao attacked Congzhi, Yu attacked Youhu, Cheng Tang destroyed Xia, and King Wu of Zhou overthrew Yin—all acted in accord with Heaven above and human affairs below. Thus, they raised weapons to console the people and punish wrongdoing. Though they annihilated states, they did not lose the people’s favor.
**Exegesis of Text**: Cui says: "They destroy enemy states yet win their people’s hearts."
(2) They destroy where the people’s hearts desire destruction, thus not losing the people’s hearts. When the bright sun ascends the sky, the six directions are all illuminated—not out of love for others that it shines upon them.

Thus, when the sage dwells in the world, he warms it as the spring sun naturally harmonizes—those who receive his nurturing grace offer no thanks. He chills it as the autumn frost naturally descends—those who wither and fall bear no resentment.

**Exegesis**: Bestowing benefit and moisture, his deeds equal the spring sun—not merely for a moment, but extending through ten thousand generations. Yet like straw dogs or the common people, he harbors no partial affection.

**Annotation (3)**: The sage takes no delight; he simply does not obstruct, and things naturally flow through.

**Exegesis**: A mirror hung high reflects whatever comes before it—neither welcoming nor sending off, how could it have emotion? The great sage responds to the moment in the same way. Harmony without leading is not the same as delighting in connection. Thus, those who impose their intent upon things are not sages.

**Annotation (4)**: Perfect benevolence has no favorites; it abides by principle and sustains itself.

**Exegesis**: Perfect benevolence has no favorites—for if it had, it would not be perfect benevolence.

**Annotation (5)**: Those who observe the heavens are not as worthy as those who forget time and naturally align with it.

**Exegesis**: Those who track the waxing and waning of celestial signs and await the movements of heavenly timing—this is mere petty wisdom, not the mark of a truly worthy one!

**Annotation (6)**: Unable to unify the paths of right and wrong and pursue benefit while avoiding harm, one injures virtue and burdens what is fitting.

**Exegesis**: Those who cannot unite success and failure, equalize benefit and harm, and instead choose between glory and disgrace, clinging to right and wrong—such a one cannot even free himself, how can he lead others?

**Annotation (7)**: The true scholar forgets fame and finds self-fulfillment, so his name matches his reality, and good fortune responds to his person.

**Exegesis**: Those who distort their conduct to seek fame lose their true nature—these are mere followers of convention, not scholars of the Dao.

**Textual Note**: *Xing ming* (行名) is read with *ming* as in "fame." *Fu ying* (福应) is read as "fortune responds."

**Annotation (8)**: Losing one’s nature and distorting oneself to follow others—one is enslaved much, how can one enslave others?

**Exegesis**: Those who distort their conduct and lose their truth to seek fame—these are the ones who are driven and enslaved by others, how can they drive others?

**Annotation (9)**: All these abandon the self to imitate others, following them to the point of self-harm.

**Exegesis**: Hu Buxie, a worthy of old—some say a worthy of Yao’s time who refused Yao’s abdication and drowned himself in a river. Wu Guang, a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time, seven feet tall. Others say he lived in the Xia era, consumed herbs to nurture his nature, loved to play the zither, and when Tang offered him the throne, he refused and carried a stone to sink himself in Lu River. Boyi and Shuqi, the two sons of the Lord of Guzhu in Liaoxi, descendants of Shennong, of the Jiang clan. When their father died, they yielded the throne to each other and refused to succeed him. Hearing that the Earl of the West was virtuous, they went to observe him. When King Wen died and King Wu attacked Yin, Boyi and Shuqi grasped his horse’s bridle to remonstrate. King Wu did not heed them, so they hid on Mount Shouyang in Hedong, refusing to eat Yin’s grain, and starved to death. Jizi, a worthy minister of King Zhou of Yin, who remonstrated but was not heeded and was enslaved. Xuyu was Jizi’s name. Another explanation: he was Wu She’s son, named Yuan, styled Zixu, a minister of King Fuchai of Wu. He remonstrated faithfully but was not heeded, had his eyes gouged out, and died, his corpse sunk in the river. Jita, surnamed Ji, named Ta, a recluse of Tang’s time. Hearing that Tang had offered the throne to Wu Guang, he feared it would extend to him and drowned himself and his disciples in Kuanshui. Shentu Di heard of this and threw himself into the river. These several men all distorted their emotions and feigned conduct, stubbornly set on establishing their names, drifting beyond their proper bounds—thus they came to this. Starving themselves, drowning themselves, shortening their lifespans and cutting short their fates, their fragrant names and fine reputations were transmitted in the historical records. Yet these were merely driven by others—how could they drive others? Delighting the ears and eyes of the multitude, how could they truly satisfy their own natures?

**Textual Note**: *Hu Buxie*—Sima Biao says: an ancient worthy. *Wu Guang*—Huangfu Mi says: a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time, his ears seven inches long. *Boyi and Shuqi*—the two sons of the Lord of Guzhu. *Jizi Xuyu*—Sima Biao says: Xuyu was Jizi’s name, as recorded in the *Shizi*. Cui agrees. Another account: the *Shizi* says: Jizi Xuyu painted his body with lac to feign leprosy, let his hair loose, and pretended madness. Another says: the *Shizi* says: it was Bigan, and Xuyu was his name. ◎ Qing Fan’s note: the *Zhengyi* of the *Book of Documents*, the *Zhengyi* of the *Zuozhuan* for the fifteenth year of Duke Xi, and the *Zhengyi* of the *Lunyu* all cite Sima Biao: Jizi’s name was Xuyu, differing from the *Shiwen*. *Jita*—read *ta* as in "what."

Shentu Di was a man of the Yin dynasty who carried a stone and drowned himself in the Yellow River. Cui’s edition reads "Situ Di." *Jieshe*—pronounced *she*, as below. **Collation Notes**: (1) The Shide Tang edition omits the character *meng*. (2) The Shide Tang edition writes *xiao* as *xun*.

The true persons of old bore a demeanor lofty yet not crumbling,
as if insufficient yet not propped up;
expansive in their angularity yet not rigid,
stretched in their emptiness yet not florid.
How radiant, as if rejoicing!
How constrained, as if compelled!
How pressing, advancing my countenance,
how companionable, halting my power!
How stern, as if worldly!
How towering, as if beyond control!
How linked, as if fond of seclusion,
how muddled, forgetting their words!

With punishment as their body,
with ritual as their wings,
with knowledge as their timing,
with virtue as their guide.

With punishment as their body, they were supple in their execution;
with ritual as their wings, they moved through the world;
with knowledge as their timing, they acted only when unavoidable;
with virtue as their guide, they walked as far as those with feet could reach the hills—
yet others truly took them for diligent practitioners.

Thus, their liking was one,
their disliking was one.
Their oneness was one,
their not-oneness was one.
Their oneness joined them to Heaven’s company,
their not-oneness joined them to human company.
Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—
this is called the true person.

**Annotations**:
[1] In harmony with things yet not cliquish.
[Commentary] *Demeanor*—traces. *Righteous*—fitting. Descending into the world’s traces, they followed what was fitting for things, emptying themselves to achieve balance, never partial or partisan.
◎ Yu Yue says: Guo’s annotation glosses *yi* as "fitting" and *peng* as "clique," imposing meaning on the text, which is mistaken. Here it describes their *demeanor*—how could it speak of their virtue? *Yi* should be read as *e* ("lofty"). *E* and *yi* both derive from the phonetic *wo*, so they are interchangeable. The *Tian Dao* chapter says *er zhuang yi ran* ("and their demeanor lofty"), where *yi ran* is *e ran* ("lofty"). *Peng* should be read as *beng* ("crumbling"). The *Yi Jing*’s *Fu* hexagram says *peng lai wu jiu* ("friends come without blame"), which the *Han Shu*’s *Wuxing Zhi* quotes as *□ lai wu jiu* ("□ comes without blame"), confirming this. *Their demeanor lofty yet not crumbling* means their bearing was towering and grand yet not collapsing. The *Guang Ya*’s *Shi Gu* defines *e* as "high," and its *Shi Xun* defines *e e* as "high." "High" and "grand" are close in meaning, so the *Wen Xuan*’s *Xijing Fu* says *shen shan e e* ("divine mountains towering"), and Xue Zong’s annotation reads: *e e* means "tall and grand." The *Tian Dao* chapter’s *yi ran* can be explained the same way. Guo, unaware that *yi* is a loan for *e*, glosses it as "fitting" here and as "a self-sustaining demeanor" there, both relying on the original character’s meaning, which is incorrect.

[2] Empty and without surplus, like insufficiency; yielding to all yet never failing to rise—like insufficiency yet not propped up.

[Commentary] Concealing brilliance and embracing emptiness, they alone seemed as if their spirit and wisdom were insufficient; moving in accord with their nature, floating freely in self-contentment—thus they had nothing to rely upon or receive.

[Phonetic Gloss] *Bù chéng*: read as written. Li [Yi] says: "to welcome." Also pronounced *zhěng*. *Bù shàng*: *shí zhǎng* (fanqie).

[3] [Annotation] Constantly roaming in solitude yet not rigidly adhering to it.
[Commentary] *Gū* means "alone"; *jiān* means "rigid." Wandering freely, unconstrained, at ease in self-possession—they roamed the realm of solitary transformation without clinging to it.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Yú hū*: read as written; also pronounced *yù*. [Xiang] Xiu says: "a hesitant appearance." ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: "同" should be an error for "向."
*Qí gū*: pronounced *gū*. Wang [Bi] says: "*Gū* means standing apart from the crowd." Cui [Zhuan] says: "*Gū* means angular." ◎ Yu Yue says: Guo’s annotation—"constantly roaming in solitude yet not rigidly adhering"—reads *gū* as "alone," yet this does not correspond to the meaning of "not rigid." The *Shiwen*’s citation of Cui—"*gū* means angular"—also fails to align with "not rigid." Both are likely incorrect.

The mastery of nurturing life lies in never having encountered the *jī* and *qìng* of the sinews, let alone the great *gū*!
[Phonetic Gloss] Cui [Zhuan] says: "not entangled in the bones." It is suspected that this *gū* character is the same as that *gū* character. The entanglement of bones is the utmost in rigidity; if *gū* is not rigid, this is called the True Person. Cui failed to recognize that *gū* and *gū* are the same character, hence the differing glosses before and after. ◎ Li Zhen says: "In the phrase *yú hū qí gū*, paired with *zhāng hū qí xū*, the character *gū* is entirely incongruous. According to the annotations and commentaries, *gū* is glossed as 'solitary.' The *Shiwen* cites Wang [Bi], saying: '*Gū* means standing apart, unsupported.' Both convey the meaning of 'alone.' It is evident that the original text must have read *gū* as *gū* (孤), a phonetic loan. The *Erya*’s *Shi Di* section reads: '*Gū*-bamboo north of the door,' and the *Shiwen* notes: 'Originally written as *gū* (孤).' This is proof of the interchangeability of *gū* and *gū*. The solitary and independent are upright and angular, hence the character may also be borrowed as *gū*. As for the two characters *yú hū*, which recur in the phrase *yú hū zhǐ wǒ dé yě* below, it is suspected that an error has occurred here. The annotation reads: 'constantly roaming in solitude.' If we seek its meaning from the word *yóu* (游, 'to roam'), it may originally have been the character *yǔ* (□) or *yù* (). The *Shuowen* states: '*Yǔ* means walking in ease'; *yù* means hastening steps. Both accord with the meaning of *yóu*."

[4]
[Annotation] Vast and unburdened, they attain to true substance.
[Commentary] *Zhāng* means "expansive." The numinous abode is broad and unobstructed, equal in measure to the void, yet their wisdom and virtue are genuine, hence they are not superficial.

[5]
[Annotation] The Perfect Person is without joy, yet harmoniously at ease, thus appearing joyful.
[Commentary] *Bǐngbǐng* is the appearance of joy. Adapting to change and following transformation, they find contentment in whatever they encounter. Truly forgetting joy and anger, they are thus said to *seem* joyful.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Bǐngbǐng*: Xu [Xuan] reads *bǐng*; Guo [Xiang] reads *fǔxìng*. Xiang [Xiu] says: "an appearance of joy." Jianwen [of Liang] says: "an appearance of brightness."

[6]
[Annotation] In movement and stillness, in action and rest, they always abide in the ultimate of necessity.
[Commentary] *Cuī* means "to move"; *jǐ* means "to stop." The True Person, serene and still, responds to things without fixed direction. Compelled, they then move—not by initiating action, but responding only when unavoidable.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Cuī hū*: read *qiān zuì* (Yu [Yue]) or *xī zuì* (Xu [Xuan]); Guo [Xiang] reads *qiě léi*. Xiang [Xiu] says: "an appearance of movement." Jianwen [of Liang] says: "an appearance of swiftness."

[7]
[Annotation] They do not allow things to harm themselves.
[Commentary] *Chù* means "to gather" or "to accumulate." The mind is like still water, thus able to gather and benefit all beings. Therefore, they respond without attachment, bestow without depletion, and whether things suit or benefit them, their spirit and countenance remain undiminished.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Chù hū*: Also written as *chù*; read *chì liù*. Sima [Biao] says: "an appearance of rising indignation." Wang [Bi] says: "abundant in virtue and fullness." Jianwen [of Liang] says: "to gather."

[8]
[Annotation] They have no fixed direction.
[Commentary] Though they respond to movement and follow the world, engaging with things and seizing opportunities, they always remain at ease and without action, acting through true virtue—what is called "moving yet ever still."

[9]
[Annotation] The Perfect Person is without peril, yet moves in step with the world, thus appearing perilous.
[Commentary] *Lì* means "danger." The True Person is one with safety and peril, oblivious to fortune and misfortune, yet blending their light with the world, they *seem* perilous. Like Confucius besieged by the people of Kuang or King Wen imprisoned in Youli, though they encountered danger, they did not abandon the practice of non-action.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Lì hū*: read as written. Cui [Zhuan] writes it as *guǎng*, saying: "to encompass is to be broad." ◎ Yu Yue says: Guo Xiang’s annotation is entirely untenable. If following his interpretation, it should read "the world seems perilous," not the reverse—"seeming like the world." Now, I propose that *shì* (世) is a phonetic loan for *tài* (泰). In the *Rongru* chapter of the *Xunzi*, it says: "*Qiáoxiè* is the calamity of man." Liu Taigong’s *Buzhu* states: "*Qiáoxiè* is a variant of *jiāotài* (骄泰)." Elsewhere in the *Xunzi*, it may appear as *dà* (汏), *shì* (忕), or *tài* (泰), all interchangeable. *Lòuxiè* (漏泄) rhymes with *wàidàhàibài* (外大害败), and is also read as *tài*. Further evidence is found in the *Jiazi*: "*Jiǎnxiè* cannot obtain scholars." Thus, reading *shì* as *tài* is akin to reading *xiè* as *tài*. Fierceness (*měnglì*) corresponds to arrogance (*jiāotài*), and the *Shiwen* notes that *lì*, written as *guǎng* by Cui, means "broad"—also corresponding to *tài*, as *tài* means "great." If read literally as *shì* (世), the meaning becomes entirely incoherent. ◎ Qing Fan notes: *Lì* should follow Cui’s version as *guǎng*, which is correct. Guo Xiang’s annotation, "moving in step with the world," implies the meaning of "broad and great." Yet to say they are "without peril" and then "seem perilous" is contradictory. In classical texts, *lì* (厉) and *guǎng* (广) are often confused. For example, in the *Liyue* chapter of the *Liji*, it says: "The Son of Heaven then *lì*-adorns," while the *Shize* chapter of the *Huainanzi* writes it as *guǎng*-adorns. In the *Pingjin Hou Zhuan* of the *Shiji*, it says: "*Lì* the worthy and grant them emoluments," and Xu Guang notes: "*Lì* is also written as *guǎng*." In the *Rulin Zhuan*, it says: "to *guǎng* worthy talent," while the *Hanshu* writes *guǎng* as *lì*. In the *Dili Zhi* of the *Hanshu*, it says: "Qi Commandery’s *guǎng*," and the *Shuowen*’s water section notes that *guǎng* is mistakenly written as *lì*. All these are evidence. ◎ Further note: Yu Yue’s proposal that *shì* is a phonetic loan for *tài* is correct. In antiquity, there was no *tài* character; it was written as *dà* (大). The characters *dà* (大) and *shì* (世) were homophonous and synonymous in ancient times, hence interchangeable. The *Liji*’s *Quli* chapter says: "One does not dare to share a name with the heir apparent," and the commentary notes: "*Shì* may also be written as *dà*." In the *Chunqiu*’s 30th year of Duke Wen, it says: "The *dà*-chamber’s roof collapsed," while the *Gongyang Zhuan* writes it as *shì*-chamber. The *Wei Taishu Yi* of the *Gongyang Zhuan* is written as *Shi Shu Yi* in the *Lunyu*. The *Yue Daxin* of the *Gongyang* is written as *Yue Shixin*. The *Zi Dashu* of Zheng in the *Lunyu* is written as *Shi Shu*. All these are evidence.

[10]
[Annotation] Lofty and free, they are self-possessed.

The exegesis states: The sage’s virtue is vast and great, towering and loftily remote, transcending the world’s bounds—thus it cannot be restrained or controlled.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*《謷乎》* wǔ gāo fǎn; Xú wǔ dào fǎn.
Sīmǎ explains: the appearance of far-reaching aspiration.
Wáng explains: rising high above the common.

[11]
**Annotation:** Boundless and profoundly distant, none perceive its gate.

**Exegesis:** *Lián* means "long." The sage’s virtue is distant and enduring, continuous and unfathomable. The mind’s path is cut off—who perceives its gate? Muffled and silent, it seems as though barred, no sound or sight of others heard.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*《连乎》* read as written.
Lǐ explains: *lián* is the appearance of continuity.
Cuī explains: obstructed and linked, pronounced *niǎn*.
*《似好》* hū bào fǎn, same below.

[12]
**Annotation:** Unknowing and unrecognizing, the celestial mechanism stirs of itself—hence its *mèn*-like state.

**Exegesis:** *Mèn* is the appearance of absence of mind. Yielding and at ease, effortless and serene, the Dark Pearl is obtained at the Red Waters—thus words are forgotten. From the foregoing, the perfected person’s self-cultivation and benefiting of others, inner and outer virtues, have been set forth in sequence. From this point onward, the perfected person’s methods of governing and benefiting the world are elucidated.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*《悗乎》* wáng běn fǎn. The character may also be written as *免*.
Lǐ explains: the appearance of unmatchedness.
Wáng explains: neglect and oblivion.
Cuī explains: compliance and gentleness.

[13]
**Annotation:** Punishment is the embodiment of governance, yet it is not of my making.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*《治之》* zhí lì fǎn.

[14]
**Annotation:** Ritual is how the world conducts itself—it is not I who establish it.

**Exegesis:** Employing penal law as governance is the foundational principle of rule; employing music as guidance is the ornament of all things.

[15]
**Annotation:** Knowledge is the movement of the times—it is not I who initiate it.

[16]
**Annotation:** Virtue is what others follow—it is not of my creation.

**Exegesis:** *Xún* means to comply. Employing wisdom to illuminate the moment ensures timeliness is not lost; engaging with others through virtue accords with their dispositions. The foregoing briefly outlined these principles; what follows provides further explanation.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*《为循》* The original may also be written as *xiū*; both are acceptable.
◎ Yú Yuè remarks: Lu [Deming]’s claim that both are acceptable is incorrect. In the passage below, “those with feet reach the hill,” the character *xún* is clearly correct. The *Shuowen* states: *xún* means “to follow in sequence.” If written as *xiū*, it would lack meaning.
◎ Qìngfān notes: The character *xún* is indeed correct. The *Guangya* defines *xún* as “to follow.” The *Commentary on the “Bei Feng”* of the *Book of Songs* states: “to follow” means *xún*. In clerical script, the characters *xún* and *xiū* are easily confused. In the *Yi Jing*, the *Xici* passage “the cultivation of virtue” is glossed in the *Shiwen* as *xún* in Ma’s version. In the *Zuozhuan*, the *Jin Yu* line “Shū played the *xiū* sound” is written as *xún* in the *Justice* commentary to the *Rites of Zhou*. In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the *Biography of Shang Yang* states, “Tang and Wu did not follow the ancients and yet reigned as kings,” where the *Suoyin* notes that the *Book of Lord Shang* writes this as *xiū*. In the *Guanzi*, the *Nine Guards* chapter reads, “follow names to supervise realities,” where modern editions erroneously write *xiū*. All these are examples of the same confusion.

**[17]**
**Annotation:** Ren Zhi’s suicide was an act of self-governance, and thus, though it was killing, it was lenient.
**Subcommentary:** *Chuo* means leniency. The purpose of employing penal law as the foundation of governance is to halt killing with killing, to punish one and deter ten thousand. Thus, though it is killing, it is lenient and simple.
Therefore, the benevolent are the people’s enemies, while the law is the people’s father.
**Phonetic Gloss:** *Chuo hu* (綽乎): *chang lüe* (昌略) in reverse.
**Cui’s Version:** *Nao* (淖).

**[18]**
**Annotation:** It accords with what the world practices, and thus there is nothing it does not accomplish.
**Subcommentary:** Though ritual is but the thinnest of loyalty and trust, it is the foremost means of governing the world. Hence, “without learning ritual, one has no means to stand”; “do not act without ritual, do not speak without ritual.” If a person lacks ritual, why do they not swiftly die? Thus, ritual is essential to governance! It upholds human relationships and is the reason it flourishes so widely in the world.

**[19]**
**Annotation:** High and low receive one another—this is an irreversible flow. The small and the great form groups—this is an inevitable circumstance. Vast and without emotion, it is the repository of all knowledge. To bear the convergence of a hundred streams and dwell at the pinnacle of those who guide others—what is there to do? Entrust oneself to the world’s wisdom, commit to what must be, and yield it all to the world.
**Subcommentary:** Responding to stimuli in accord with the moment, wielding supreme knowledge to meet the times, principle has no visible or audible form, yet circumstances possess an inescapable momentum. Thus, the true master is vast and without attachment, entrusting all to the collective wisdom, abiding in the convergence of what must be, and riding it as one would wander.

**[20]**
**Annotation:** The mound is that by which things are rooted. In terms of nature, it is the root of nature. All things have their own sufficiency, and this sufficiency lies in their root. Yielding to the self-following of the myriad virtues, this is like those with feet reaching their root. When the root is attained, principle is exhausted.
**Subcommentary:** The mound is the root. Engaging with things through virtue, one accords with their nature. Each nature has its own allotment, and when one abides within that allotment, it is sufficient. Accord with this root-nature, and thus one reaches the mound.
**Jia Shifu’s Note:** Kong Anguo said, “The records of the Nine Provinces are called the *Nine Mounds*.” The *Zeyang* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* also speaks of “the words of mounds and villages.” Thus, all dwellings are called mounds. The ruins of Zhuanxu are called the *Imperial Mound*. Those with feet who can walk will ultimately return to their dwelling. Following ritual is like resting in the comfort of one’s home—those with feet will inevitably arrive.

**[21]**
**Annotation:** All these come to completion from that, and their completion does not lie within oneself. Thus, though one dwells at the pinnacle of a myriad affairs, one remains ever at leisure and at ease, suddenly unaware of affairs passing through the body, oblivious to words issuing from the mouth. Yet the great delusion of people is to truly believe that the perfected person acts with tireless effort.
**Subcommentary:** The perfected person moves like drifting clouds and rests like the valley spirit, with realm and wisdom utterly forgotten, the empty mind responding to the mysterious. How could they harbor attachment to things or be bound by emotions to salvation? Yet the common people, clinging to their paths, see the boat as the means to ferry all beings, the pavilion as the means to nurture the multitude, and truly believe the sage labors without rest. How could they know that above the Fen River, one is serene and profoundly still? Thus, the preceding text states, “Who would trouble themselves with things as affairs?”

**Phonetic Gloss:** *Chang xian* (常闲): read as *xian* (闲).

**[22]**
**Annotation:** Constantly without mind and in accord with that, thus likes and dislikes, approvals and disapprovals, are no different from those of others.
**Subcommentary:** Having forgotten attachment to beauty and ugliness, one also casts aside love and hatred. Thus, likes and dislikes arise from the emotions of the common, yet the sage’s wisdom is empty and all-embracing, never failing to be one with them.

**[23]**
**Annotation:** That it is one is the work of Heaven; that it is not one is the work of man. The true person is one with Heaven and man, equalizing self and other, not differing in their oneness from their non-oneness.
**Subcommentary:** Its oneness is sagely wisdom; its non-oneness is the emotions of the common. Yet since the sage and the common are not two, the non-one is also subsumed into the one.

**[24]**
**Annotation:** That there is nothing which is not one—this is Heaven.

**[25]**
**Annotation:** That it is “that” and “this,” “I” and “me”—this is man.
**Subcommentary:** To be one with Heaven and man, to equalize the myriad manifestations, is to be of the same kind as the mysterious Heaven. To be “that” and “this,” “I” and “me,” is to be of the same kind as the common multitude.

**[26]**
**Annotation:** The true person is one with Heaven and man, equalizing the myriad manifestations. The myriad manifestations do not oppose one another, Heaven and man do not overcome one another. Thus, they are vast and without anything that is not one, obscure and without anything that is not present, and mysteriously identical with that and this.
**Subcommentary:** Though Heaven is without that and this, and man possesses right and wrong, when one examines this resolutely, all returns to emptiness and quiescence. If Heaven were superior and man inferior, how could they be called equal? This is to blend Heaven and man into one, to obscure the distinction between victory and defeat. Those who embody this can be called true persons.

Life and death are fate; their constancy of night and day is Heaven.
What man cannot partake in—these are all the conditions of things.
They take Heaven as their father and still cherish it—how much more that which transcends it!
They take having a lord as better than themselves and still die for it—how much more that which is true!

**[1]**
**Annotation:** The constancy of day and night is the Way of Heaven. Thus, to know that life and death are the extremes of fate is not arbitrary—it is like night and day. To what could they be bound?

The constancy of dawn’s brightness and night’s darkness is the eternal Way of Heaven; the coming and going of life and death is the allotted fate of man. Heaven cannot be without day and night—how then can man be without life and death? Thus, to follow change and drift with the current, to what could I be bound?

**[2]**
**Annotation:** The true person obtains day in the day and night in the night. Taking life and death as day and night, how could there be anything one does not attain! That man has things he cannot attain and yet harbors sorrow and joy in his breast—these are all the conditions of things, not the principle.

Life and death, day and night, are the eternal Way of man and Heaven, never separate from the self—what is there to be bound to? Yet the vulgar crowd resists the workings of creation, unable to rest in their time and abide in their lot, to go along with change. They rejoice in life and abhor death, harboring sorrow and joy in their hearts. This is but the stagnant emotion of ordinary things—how could it be the penetrating wisdom of the true person!

**[3]**
**Annotation:** *Zhuo* (卓) refers to solitary transformation. The efficacy of mutual dependence is not as great as the perfection of solitary transformation. Thus, what man depends upon is Heaven; what Heaven gives birth to is solitary transformation. All men take Heaven as their father, and so even the changes of day and night, the cycles of cold and heat, they dare not resent, but follow Heaven and rest in it. How much more that which is *zhuo*—solitary transformation—reaching the mysterious and obscure realm! How could one not submit to it? Having submitted, then life and death, change and transformation, are but to follow fate.

*Zhuo* refers to solitary transformation. The multitude of men, receiving qi from the azure vault, take Heaven alone as their father, cherishing and revering it. Even the alternation of day and night and the shifts of cold and warmth, they cannot reverse or resist. How much more the abstruse and recondite realm of the perfect Way, the consummation of solitary and natural transformation, giving birth to Heaven and Earth, opening and closing yin and yang! One can only rest in it and submit—how could one resist and not comply!

**[4]**
**Annotation:** The *zhen* (真, true) is that which does not borrow from things but is natural. The natural cannot be avoided—how could it be merely the command of a lord!

*Yu* (愈) means "superior." The *zhen* is the solitary transformation just mentioned. Men take the lord and king alone as superior to themselves in honor and nobility, and still lay down their lives and devote themselves, not daring to avoid it. How much more the ultimate of the mysterious Way, the principle of the natural! Could one desire not to comply? To arrange and entrust oneself to transformation is surely fitting.

When the springs dry up, fish find themselves together on dry land. They moisten one another with their breath, wet one another with their foam—better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes. Rather than praise Yao and condemn Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Way.

The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to be good to my life is to be good to my death.

**[1]**
**Annotation:** Rather than be insufficient and love one another, how much better to have abundance and forget one another!

This begins with a metaphor. In the vastness of rivers and lakes, fish swim freely, each with enough deep water, no longer coming and going. They forget one another, and affection is cut off. But when the springs dry up, sturgeon and salmon are distressed, stranded together on dry land, their tails and gills exposed. Then they wet one another with foam, moisten one another with breath, coming and going in affection, drawing ever closer. Compared to the rivers and lakes, this is far removed. It is like the age of the great Way, when things each roamed freely, the sounds of chickens and dogs not reaching one another. When the pure wind scattered and the turbid waves arose, teachings emerged from principle, and the traces of sages appeared. They prided themselves on limping and hobbling as benevolence, on tiptoeing as righteousness. Fathers and sons, brothers, harbored emotions and deceived one another. The sage felt shame—rightly so. Thus, we know that fish lose water and so moisten one another with breath and foam, just as men lose the Way and so cling to one another in affection.

**[2]**
**Annotation:** Praise and blame both arise from insufficiency. Thus, the perfectly sufficient forgets good and evil, leaves behind life and death, and becomes one with change and transformation. Vast and unobstructed, there is nothing it does not accommodate—how could it know where Yao and Jie reside?

This completes the metaphor. Tang Yao was a sage-king, and Xia Jie a mediocre lord. Thus, to praise Yao as good and condemn Jie as evil, to take Yao and Shun as models to exhort posterity, is the foundation from which benevolence and righteousness arise. How much better to be without good and without evil, to forget both good and evil! To be without "is" and without "is not," to cast off both "is" and "is not"! Then, to go forth from life and enter death, to roam along with change and transformation; to come and go without destination, to tread the mysterious Way and find contentment in oneself.

How could this compare with those who warm and moisten the sagely traces, speaking of them as equals!

The bodily forms of birth, aging, and death—all are myself. Thus, the body bears me, birth labors me, old age rests me, and death gives me repose. Though these four transform, they have never ceased to be myself—why should I regret them?

The Great Clod is nature. The body is a constructed thing; birth, the beginning of nurturance; old age, the years of maturity; death, the day when qi disperses. Yet the one who bears the form must endure toil in life; in old age, lacking ability, one finds brief ease; in death, returning to nothingness, one rests by principle. Though these four transform, they have never ceased to be myself—so why should I feel any regret?

Death and life are both matters of fate. Without goodness, there is death; with goodness, there is life—not goodness alone. If, then, you deem my life to be good, then my death is good as well.

The bodily forms of birth, aging, and death—all are myself. Thus, if one deems the goodness of my life to be good, then my death may also be deemed good.

To hide a boat in a ravine or conceal a mountain in a marsh is called secure. Yet in the dead of night, a man of strength may carry them away, and the unwitting do not know it. Though one hides things great or small as is fitting, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to find no escape—this is the great truth of all things.

Yet men rejoice merely in possessing human form. If the human form itself undergoes ten thousand transformations without end, how immeasurable would its joy be! Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and all abide.

To excel in youth, excel in age, excel in beginning, excel in end—men still emulate this. How much more, then, should they emulate that on which the ten thousand things depend and by which the single transformation is sustained!

To speak of death and life as transformations inescapable, one first sets forth the extreme of what cannot be escaped, then clarifies it with the sign of inevitable change, to follow transformation without attachment.

The power of the powerless is none greater than that of transformation. Thus it lifts heaven and earth to hasten toward the new, bears mountains and peaks to abandon the old. Without the slightest pause, it has already traversed the new—so heaven and earth and the ten thousand things are never without change. The world is ever renewed, yet men regard it as old; the boat is daily altered, yet they see it as before; the mountain is daily transformed, yet they view it as of old. Now they clasp an arm and lose it—all has departed in darkness. Thus, the self of before is no longer the self of now. The self and the present pass together—how could they ever cling to the old? Yet the world does not perceive this, stubbornly believing that what it now encounters can be bound and held. How deluded!

In the darkness of midnight, this illustrates the profound obscurity of the true principle. The "man of strength" is the work of creation. To hide a boat in the sea’s ravine is fitting; to conceal mountains in the marsh is proper. Yet the power of creation bears them away and hastens onward—change is ever renewed, swift as flowing water. The deluded, their minds dull and foolish, truly believe that boat and mountain stand firm, unmoving and steadfast. How could they know that in darkness all shifts without cease? Yesterday’s self and today’s self are just the same.

Not knowing to embody transformation and seeking to hide things so they do not change—though one hides them most deeply and securely, each in its proper place, one cannot prevent their daily alteration. Thus, those who hide and possess cannot halt their escape; those who do not hide and yield to change cannot be altered by change.

To hide a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh is to hide the great; to hide a person in a room or an object in a vessel is to hide the small. Though great and small differ, all hiding is fitting, yet thoughts still flow and shift, ever renewed. Thus, the Way of transformation admits no escape.

To hide nothing and entrust all to it is to be one with things, to be undivided from change. Thus, there is no outer, no inner, no death, no life—embodying heaven and earth and uniting with transformation, one seeks escape and finds none. This is the great truth of constant abiding, not the petty intent of a single corner.

To hide the world within the world—is this truly hiding? It is to hide nothing at all. Thus, one equalizes life and death, obscures change, roams freely within the cosmos, and rides creation in play. Since one alters what cannot be altered, where is there escape? This is to embody the stillness of all things and grasp the true essence of the great Dao—how could it be the delusion of the vulgar or the petty wisdom of the worldly?

V.

Man’s form is but one encounter among the myriad transformations—nothing to rejoice in exclusively. Within the boundless, all that one meets is like man; why should only the human form bring joy while other things yield no delight?

◎ Qingfan’s note: *Wen Xuan* commentary on Jia Yi’s *Fu on the Owl* cites Sima [Biao] as saying: “It will again transform into nothingness.”

VI.

Originally not human, one transforms into human—yet in becoming human, one loses what was before. To lose what was before and rejoice is to rejoice in what one encounters. Transformations are endless; what is there one will not meet? Meeting and delighting in it, how could delight have any limit?

VII.

The sage roams the paths of transformation, drifts upon the ceaseless current of renewal. The myriad things and myriad changes—he changes with them. Since transformations are boundless, he too is boundless. Who can escape him? In life, one is as if gone; in death, one is as if present—so when is one not present?

VIII.

This is to equalize within the span of a hundred years, not to be young in goodness and old in decline. Yet one has not embodied transformation or equalized life and death. Still, in its even purity, it is enough to serve as a teacher for others.

◎ "Goodness and decline" (Cui’s edition reads "cunning," same pronunciation). Anciently written as *yao* (夭), pronounced *yu* in *biao*. Simplified text reads *yao* (夭). ◎ Lu Wenchong notes: Current text reads *yao* (夭). ◎ Qingfan’s note: The character *yao* (妖) is correctly written as *yao* (夭). *Yao* and *yao* were interchangeable in antiquity. *Records of the Grand Historian: Annals of Zhou*: "The abandoned child of a palace concubine," where Xu Guang notes: *yao* (妖) is written as *yao* (夭). Cui’s reading of *jiao* (狡) is incorrect. ◎ "Young in goodness" (*shao*), rhyming with *zhao*. ◎ "Old in decline" (*bi*), pronounced *bi*. Also written as *bi* (鄙). ◎ "Even purity" (*suì*), rhyming with *sui*.

IX.

This is to be profoundly one with the myriad things and embody transformation. Thus, to be revered by all under heaven is only fitting.

To be bound is to belong. Human understanding varies in brightness and obscurity. Even within a hundred years, within a single lifetime, some move with ease and equanimity, rarely stirred by joy or sorrow, untroubled by longevity or early death, youth or old age.

Though one may not yet transcend life and death, if one harbors no aversion, this alone suffices to serve as a teacher and guide for all things, for people to emulate and follow. How much more so when one merges with the myriad things, obscurely uniting with transformation! Belonging to the perfected person, this necessarily relies on sagely wisdom, serving as the master and model for all things—is this not fitting indeed!

◎ The Dao possesses sentiment and sincerity, yet is without action or form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained yet not seen. It is self-originating and self-rooted; before the existence of heaven and earth, it has endured since antiquity. It spirits forth ghosts and gods, empowers emperors, gives birth to heaven and earth. It exists before the Great Ultimate yet is not lofty; it dwells below the Six Poles yet is not deep. It precedes the birth of heaven and earth yet is not ancient; it endures beyond remote antiquity yet is not old.

Fuxi attained it and thereby harnessed heaven and earth. The Fu Xi clan attained it and thereby embraced the Mother of Qi. The Northern Dipper attained it and thus remains unerring through all ages. The sun and moon attained it and thus never cease. Kanhuai attained it and thereby embraced Kunlun. Feng Yi attained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jian Wu attained it and thereby dwelt upon the great mountains. The Yellow Emperor attained it and thereby ascended the cloudy heavens. Zhuan Xu attained it and thereby resided in the Dark Palace. Yuqiang attained it and stood at the North Pole. The Queen Mother of the West attained it and sat upon Shaoguang, her beginning and end unknown. Peng Zu attained it, reaching from the age of Yu to the Five Hegemons. Fu Yue attained it and thereby assisted Wu Ding, governing all under heaven, riding the Eastern Cord and the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, aligning with the ranks of stars.

Lǐ is pronounced like *shǐ*. Sima: "Name of an ancient sovereign."

*Yǐ qiè*: Xu: *kǔ jié* (to bind); Guo: *kǔ xì* (to connect). Sima: "The essential; having grasped the essential of Heaven and Earth." Cui: "To complete."

**Section Eight**
Commentary: Fu Xi was one of the Three Sovereigns. He could subdue oxen and ride horses, tame and domesticate animals, hence the name Fu Xi. *Xí* means "to unite." *Qì mǔ* is the mother of primordial *qi*, corresponding to the Dao. Having attained the supreme Dao, he could inscribe the Eight Trigrams, unfold the six lines, harmonize *yin* and *yang*, and unite with primordial *qi*.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Fú Xī*: pronounced *Xī*. Cui’s version reads *Fú Xī Shì* (Fu Xi Clan).
*Yǐ xí qì mǔ*: Sima: "*Xí* means 'to enter'; *qì mǔ* is the mother of primordial *qi*." Cui: "To take the root of primordial *qi*."

**Section Nine**
Commentary: *Wéi Dǒu* is the Northern Dipper, the guiding cord of all stars, hence called *Wéi Dǒu* ("Mainstay Dipper"). *Tè* means "deviation." *Gǔ* means "beginning."

Having attained the supreme Dao, he could traverse the cycle of beginning and end, sustain Heaven and Earth, and keep his mind free from deviation.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Wéi Dǒu*: Li: "The Northern Dipper serves as the guiding cord of all under Heaven." ◎Lu Wenchang: "Modern editions read 'all under Heaven' as 'Heaven’s.'"
*Zhōng gǔ*: Cui: "*Zhōng gǔ* means 'eternal.'" Zheng Xuan’s annotation to the *Rites of Zhou*: "*Zhōng gǔ* is akin to 'constant.'"
*Bù tè*: Pronounced *tā dé* in reverse, meaning "deviation." Cui’s version reads *dài*.

**Section Ten**
Commentary: The radiance of the sun and moon bears witness to the singular Dao, thus they traverse the cycle of beginning and end in illumination, ceaseless and without respite.

**Section Eleven**
Commentary: *Kūn Lún* is the name of a mountain, located north of the Northern Sea. *Kān Pī* is the name of a spirit of Mount Kūn Lún. *Xí* means "to enter." *Kān Pī* has the face of a human and the body of a beast; having attained the Dao, he entered Mount Kūn Lún to become its spirit.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Kān Pī*: Xu reads *fú méi*; Guo reads *fū bēi*. Cui’s version reads *Pī*. Sima: "*Kān Pī* is the name of a spirit, with the face of a human and the form of a beast." The *Huainanzi* reads *Qīn Fù*.
*Kūn Lún*: *Kūn* may also be written as *Mín*, both pronounced *kūn*. Below, *lún* is read *lì mén*. *Kūn Lún* is the name of a mountain.

**Section Twelve**
Commentary: His surname was *Féng*, given name *Yí*, a native of *Tóng Xiāng* in *Huá Yīn*, *Hóng Nóng*, born in the village of *Dī Shǒu Lǐ*. Having ingested the Eight Minerals, he attained water immortality. *Dà Chuān* refers to the Yellow River. The Heavenly Thearch bestowed upon *Féng Yí* the title of *Hé Bó* (River Earl), and thus he roamed and dwelled within the great rivers of *Méng Jīn*.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Féng Yí*: Sima: The *Qīng Líng Zhuàn* states: "*Féng Yí* was a native of *Dī Shǒu* in *Tóng Xiāng*, *Huá Yīn*. Having ingested the Eight Minerals, he attained water immortality and became the *Hé Bó*." Another account: "On the *gēng zǐ* day of the eighth month, he bathed in the river and drowned." Yet another: "He drowned while crossing the river."
*Dà Chuān*: The Yellow River. Cui’s version reads *Tài Chuān*.

**Section Thirteen**
Commentary: *Jiān Wú* is the name of a spirit. Having attained the Dao, he dwelled on the Eastern Marchmount as the spirit of Mount Tài.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Jiān Wú*: Sima: "A mountain spirit who did not die, living until the time of Confucius."
*Dà Shān*: Pronounced *tài* or read as written.

**Section Fourteen**
Commentary: The Yellow Emperor was *Xuān Yuán*. He mined copper from Mount Shǒu and cast tripods at the foot of Mount Jīng. When the tripods were completed, a dragon descended to the tripods to welcome the Emperor. The Emperor then led his ministers and seventy-two members of his inner court, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, riding clouds and mounting the dragon, transforming into an immortal and departing.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Huáng Dì*: Cui: "Having attained the Dao, he ascended to Heaven."

**Section Fifteen**
Commentary: *Zhuān Xū*, grandson of the Yellow Emperor, was also known as Emperor Gāo Yáng or the Dark Emperor. At the age of twelve, he donned the cap of adulthood; at fifteen, he assisted *Shǎo Hào*; at twenty, he ascended the throne. He mined copper from Mount Yǔ to forge tripods, capable of summoning the spirits of the Four Seas, possessing numinous efficacy. He passed away at the age of ninety-seven, having attained the Dao and become the Emperor of the North. *Xuán* is the color of the North, hence he dwelled in the Dark Palace.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Zhuān Xū*: Pronounced *zhuān*; below, *xū* is read *yù*.
*Xuán Gōng*: Li: "*Zhuān Xū* was Emperor Gāo Yáng. The *Xuán Gōng* is the palace of the North." The *Monthly Ordinances* states: "Its Emperor is *Zhuān Xū*, its spirit is *Xuán Míng*."

**Section Sixteen**
Commentary: *Yú Qiáng* is the name of a water spirit, also called *Yú Jīng*. He has the face of a human and the body of a bird, rides dragons in his travels, and is a descendant of *Zhuān Xū* and *Xuān Yuán*. Though he attained the Dao, he did not occupy the throne of an Emperor but became a water spirit. As the water position corresponds to the North, his title is the Northern Culmen.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Yú Qiáng*: Pronounced *yú*; Guo reads *yǔ lóng*. Sima: The *Shān Hǎi Jīng* states: "On an islet in the Northern Sea, there is a spirit with the face of a human and the body of a bird, wearing two blue serpents as earrings and treading upon two red serpents, named *Yú Qiáng*." Cui: The *Dà Huāng Jīng* states: "The spirit of the Northern Sea is named *Yú Qiáng*, with the divine tortoise as his emissary." The *Guī Cáng* states: "In ancient times, the son of King Mu divined with milfoil before *Yú Qiáng*." According to the *Hǎi Wài Jīng*: "The Northern *Yú Qiáng* has a black body and limbs, riding two dragons." Guo Pu considered him a water spirit with the face of a human and the body of a bird. *Jiǎn Wén* states: "The spirit of the Northern Sea, also named *Yú Jīng*, is a grandson of the Yellow Emperor."

**Section Seventeen**
Commentary: *Shǎo Guǎng* is the name of a mountain in the Western Culmen. The Queen Mother of the West is the essence of the Great Yin, with a leopard’s tail, tiger’s teeth, and a fondness for laughter. During the reign of Emperor Shùn, the Queen Mother dispatched an envoy to present a jade ring; during the reign of Emperor Wǔ of Hàn, she offered green peaches. Her appearance resembled that of a girl of sixteen or seventeen, exceedingly graceful and proper. She constantly resided on Mount *Shǎo Guǎng* in the West, beyond the cycles of life and death, hence none know her beginning or end.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Xī Wáng Mǔ*: The *Shān Hǎi Jīng* states: "She resembles a human, with a dog’s tail, disheveled hair, wearing a *shèng* ornament, skilled in whistling, and dwelling on the shore of the sea." The *Hàn Wǔ Nèi Zhuàn* states: "The Queen Mother of the West and the Upper Prime Lady descended to the Emperor, their beauty that of divine immortals."
*Shǎo Guǎng*: Sima: "The name of a cave." Cui: "The name of a mountain." Another account: "The name of the empty realm in the West."

**Section Eighteen**
Commentary: *Péng Zǔ* was a great-great-grandson of Emperor *Zhuān Xū*. Enfeoffed at *Péng* City, his Dao was worthy of being ancestral, hence he was called *Péng Zǔ*. Skilled in nurturing his nature, he was one who attained the Dao. The Five Lords were: *Kūn Wú* as the Lord of Xià, *Dà Péng* and *Shǐ Wéi* as the Lords of Yīn, and *Qí Huán* and *Jìn Wén* as the Lords of Zhōu, together forming the Five Lords. *Péng Zǔ* attained the Dao, thus enjoying longevity, living from the time of *Yǒu Yú* through the Yīn and Zhōu dynasties, for a total of eight hundred years.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Péng Zǔ*: Explanation found in the *Xiāo Yáo* chapter. Cui: "He lived for seven hundred years." Another account: "He was considered an immortal who did not die."

**Section Nineteen**

*The Five Lords*: Read as *bó* (lords). Alternatively pronounced *bà* (hegemons). Cui and Li state: "The Lord of Xià was *Kūn Wú*, the Lords of Yīn were *Dà Péng* and *Shǐ Wéi*, and the Lords of Zhōu were *Qí Huán* and *Jìn Wén*."

**Commentary**: The Dao is non-action. This speaks of attaining it through the Dao, thereby clarifying that it is self-attained. Being self-attained means the Dao cannot cause one to attain it; if I have not attained it, neither can I force attainment. Thus, all who attain it neither rely on the Dao externally nor depend on themselves internally—they spontaneously attain it and transform alone. The difficulty of life lies precisely in this spontaneous attainment and self-possession. Having attained life, why fret over failing to attain it and thus act upon it? Therefore, striving for life ultimately fails to preserve life, for life does not originate from oneself, and such striving injures one’s true life.

**Exegesis**: *Wǔ Dīng* was the name of an Yīn king, styled *Gāo Zōng*. *Gāo Zōng* dreamed of obtaining *Fù Yuè* and dispatched envoys to seek him throughout the realm. He was found at *Fùyán*, a rammed-earth worksite in *Héběi* County of *Shànzhōu*, and served as *Wǔ Dīng*’s minister, bringing sudden peace and prosperity. *Fù Yuè* was the essence of a star. There is a single star of *Fù Yuè* above the *Jī* and *Wěi* constellations. Since *Jī* and *Wěi* are among the twenty-eight lunar lodges, sustaining the eastern quadrant, it is said he "rode the eastern cord and mounted the *Jī* tail," and "stood among the ranked stars," for he aligned with stars like *Jiǎo* and *Kàng* in their celestial array.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Fù Yuè*: Pronounced *yuè*.
*Obtained him as minister*: *Xiàng*, read *xiàng* (to assist).
*Wǔ Dīng ruled all under heaven, rode the eastern cord, mounted the *Jī* tail, and stood among the ranked stars*: Sima states: "*Fù Yuè* was a minister of Yīn. *Wǔ Dīng* was the Yīn king *Gāo Zōng*. The eastern cord lies between *Jī* and *Dǒu*, the eastern strand of the Milky Way." The *Star Canon* says: "There is one star of *Fù Yuè* above the tail, meaning he rode the eastern cord and mounted the space between the *Jī* tail." Cui states: "When *Fù Yuè* died, his spirit rode the eastern cord and lodged in the dragon’s tail, becoming a constellation. Today, there is a *Fù Yuè* star above the tail." Cui’s edition adds below: "Born without parents, upon death he ascended in three years and his form vanished—this speaks of the spirit’s ineffable nature," totaling twenty-two characters.
*Spontaneously*: *Jué rán*, read *qú wù*.
**Collation Notes**
(1) The *Shì Dé Táng* edition omits *wéi* (to act).
(2) The ancient character follows the main text.
(3) The *Shì Dé Táng* edition reads *shén* (spirit) as *rén* (person).
(4) The *Shì Dé Táng* edition omits *fú* (therefore).

**Nán Bó Zǐ Kuí** asked *Nǚ Yǔ*: "You are advanced in years, yet your complexion resembles that of a child—how is this so?"

**Commentary**: *Kuí* is likely a corruption of *Qí*, as in *Nán Guō Zǐ Qí* from the *Rén Jiān Shì* chapter. *Nǚ Yǔ* was an ancient adept of the Dao. *Child* here means an infant. *Nǚ Yǔ* had long heard the perfect Dao, enabling him to cultivate and nourish life. Though aged, he retained the complexion of youth and the radiance of vitality. Being unlike ordinary people, *Zǐ Kuí* asked how he achieved this.

**Exegetical Notes**
*Nán Bó Zǐ Kuí*: Li states: "*Kuí* should be *Qí*, a phonetic error."
*Nǚ Yǔ*: Xu reads *yǔ*, Li reads *jǔ*. Another account: "She was a woman."
*Advanced in years*: Read *zhàng*.
*Child*: Originally *zǐ*, now corrected to *rú*, read *rú* (child). Li states: "A weak child."
**Note by Lú Wénchāo**: The current text reads *dīng zhàng*, consistent with other instances.
**Note by Lú Wénchāo**: The current text reads *rú*, which is the correct form.

He replied: "I have heard the Dao."

He replied: "Having heard the Dao, I let life unfold naturally—thus my qi and complexion remain whole."

**Commentary**
Hearing the Dao allows one to preserve life in its entirety, which is why one reverts to youth and regains the radiance of a child.

Nán Bó Zǐ Kuí asked: "Can the Dao be learned?"

**Commentary**
Witnessing such an extraordinary countenance, he was filled with admiration and thus inquired about the method.

**Textual Note**
The *Zhào Jiànyì* edition omits the character *Dao*.

He said: "Alas! How could it be? You are not the right person. Now, Bǔliáng Yǐ possesses the talent of a sage but lacks the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but lack the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might indeed become a sage! Otherwise, imparting the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I still maintained my practice and instructed him: after three days, he could transcend the world; having transcended the world, I maintained my practice further, and after seven days, he could transcend things; having transcended things, I maintained my practice further, and after nine days, he could transcend life. Only after transcending life could he attain morning clarity; attaining morning clarity, he could perceive the solitary; perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present; transcending past and present, he could enter the realm of neither death nor life. That which takes life does not die; that which gives life does not live. As for the Dao, it sends nothing away, welcomes nothing; destroys nothing, completes nothing. Its name is *yīngníng*. *Yīngníng* is that which is completed only through embrace."

**Commentary**
"Alas! How could it be?" means it is impossible. Nǚ Yǔ’s spirit was inwardly still, while his appearance outwardly radiant. Zǐ Kuí, seeing his countenance, eagerly requested to learn. Finding his question inappropriate, Nǚ Yǔ dismissed him as unfit.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*È è kě*: Both read as *wū*. Below, *è hū* is the same.

**Commentary**
Bǔliáng is a surname of the Jī clan; Yǐ is his given name. Emptiness and tranquility constitute the Dao; wisdom and acuity constitute talent. Bǔliáng possessed external talent but lacked inner tranquility, while Nǚ Yǔ possessed the Dao of emptiness but lacked keen talent—each was limited to one side, neither fully perfected. Yet when comparing talent to the Dao, talent is inferior while the Dao prevails.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Bǔliáng Yǐ*: Read as *yú qǐ*, or alternatively *qí qǐ*. Li states: "Bǔliáng is the surname; Yǐ is the given name."

**Commentary**
*Shù* means to admire; *jǐ* means near; *guǒ* means certain.

The superior scholar, upon hearing the Dao, still relies on diligent practice—without diligent practice, the Dao cannot be attained. Thus, though one may receive instruction, one must cultivate and study, admiring and drawing near to the mysterious Dao, resolutely becoming a sage. If this is not so, the teachings may be easily imparted, but the effort of cultivation and preservation is what makes attainment difficult. Now, though Nǚ Yǔ has long heard the supreme Dao and inwardly embodies stillness and tranquility, even in transmitting it, she must guard it herself. How much more so for the beginner—there is no room for slackness. Even if one speaks of it with the mouth and hears it with the ears, what benefit is there? Thus, it is not knowing that is difficult, but practicing that is difficult.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Yì yì*: Read as *yǐ chǐ*.

**Commentary**
*Wài* means to abandon.

**Commentary**
*Wài* means to forget. To be a teacher is not easy; transmitting the Dao is exceedingly difficult. Just as she was about to instruct others, she concentrated her spirit and stilled her thoughts, cultivating and preserving it for a full three days. Once her mind was empty and tranquil, all phenomena became void—thus, all beneath heaven and upon the earth were entirely nonexistent.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Cān rì*: Read as *sān*.

**Commentary**
*Wù* refers to things needed morning and night, intimately tied to oneself and difficult to forget.

**Commentary**
The myriad phenomena of the world are distant and thus easily forgotten; the things that sustain the body are close and thus difficult to abandon. Only after guarding it for seven days was she able to let them go. As Guo’s commentary states: *Wù* refers to things needed morning and night, intimately tied to oneself and difficult to forget.

**Commentary**
To dissolve the body and depart from form, to sit in forgetfulness and lose the self—after long practice, the abandonment deepens.

**Commentary**
To forget life is not to loathe death; not loathing death, whatever one encounters is accepted with equanimity. Suddenly unobstructed, one sees the moment and acts—this is *zhāo chè*.

**Commentary**
*Zhāo* means dawn; *chè* means clarity. Seeing life and death as one, forgetting both self and things, wisdom shines forth like the morning sun breaking through—thus it is called *zhāo chè*.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Néng zhāo*: Read as written. Li reads it as *chú yáo*. The same below.
*Chè*: Read as written. Guo and Sima state: *Zhāo* means dawn; *chè* is the Dao of profound attainment. Li states: One who can perceive with clarity does not require a full morning to achieve far-reaching insight.
*Bù wù*: Read as *wū lù*. The same below.
*Huòrán*: Read as *huàn huó*.

**8. Commentary**
To accept whatever one encounters, forgetting all that precedes or follows—this is to perceive the *Alone*.

**Commentary**
The supreme Dao is serene, transcending speech and form, neither non-being nor being, neither past nor present. It comes and goes alone, free from dependence or opposition. To behold this sublime realm is called *seeing the Alone*. Thus the *Laozi* says: "Silent and unmoving, it does not change."

**9. Commentary**
To proceed together with the *Alone*.

**Commentary**
Following the daily renewal of creation, moving with transformation without being swayed by external conditions—thus there is no distinction between past and present.

**10. Commentary**
Attachment to life gives rise to death; aversion to death gives rise to life. Only when there is no attachment and no aversion can there be neither death nor life.

**Commentary**
"Past and present" are but convergences. The distinction between past and present, the separation of life and death—these are the inverted views of the deluded. Time flows ceaselessly, ever new, without past or present; thus the Dao neither departs nor arrives, neither dies nor lives. Who but the disciple of *Nü Yu* can grasp this truth?

**11. Commentary**
*Shā* means extinction; *sǐ*, death, is also extinction. To say that this death has not yet perished, or that this life has not yet arisen—both death and life enter into the state of neither death nor life. Thus, in embodying the Dao, there is no arising or ceasing. If the Dao neither arises nor ceases, how can the emotions feel joy or aversion? To follow it is to find all things fitting.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*"Shā shēng zhě bù sǐ"*: Li says: *Shā* means "to lose"; to lose life is not to die. Cui says: To eliminate the pursuit of life is to "kill life."
*"Shēng shēng zhě bù shēng"*: Li says: To cling to life is not to live. Cui says: To constantly pursue life is to "generate life."

**12. Commentary**
To allow things to follow their own course—thus nothing is not escorted.

**13. Commentary**
To allow things to come of their own accord—thus nothing is not welcomed.

**Commentary**
*Jiāng* means "to send off." The Dao, as a thing, aids and saves without fixed method. Though it neither perishes nor arises, it also arises and perishes. Thus it welcomes boundless life and sends off measureless death.

**14. Commentary**
To allow things to destroy themselves—thus nothing is not destroyed.

**15. Commentary**
To allow things to complete themselves—thus nothing is not completed.

**Commentary**
Without sending, yet sending—nothing is not destroyed; without welcoming, yet welcoming—nothing is not brought to completion.

**16. Commentary**
One who merges with things is entangled when they are entangled, yet never fails to remain at peace.

**Commentary**
*Yíng* means disturbance; *níng*, stillness. The sage, compassionate and beneficent, aids all beings with the Dao. Though nameless in essence, they assume names in response to things. Moving yet ever still, though entangled, they remain at peace.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Yíng*: Guo reads as *yíng*; Xu as *yú yíng*; Li as *yú yíng*. Cui says: To be bound or attached.
◎ Jia Shifu says: Zhao Qi’s commentary on the *Mencius* defines *yíng* as "pressure." When the views of life and death press upon the mind, and the mechanisms of welcoming, completing, destroying, and sending press from without—yet the heart remains unmoved—this is called *yíng níng*. Placing oneself amid the tumult of flourishing change, where conflicts and collisions abound, yet the mind remains fundamentally at peace—this is near to perfection. Thus it is said: "Only after entanglement does one achieve completion."

**17. Commentary**
If things are entangled yet one alone remains untangled, this is ruin. To be entangled yet follow along—thus nothing fails to be perfectly accomplished.

**Commentary**
Only by harmonizing light and dust, moving yet ever still, can one then respond to the entanglements of things and skillfully bestow life and completion.

**Textual Note**
(1) The missing character in the Jiangnan ancient manuscript adds *gù* ("thus") before *shā*.
(2) The Shide Hall edition reads *yǐ* ("already") as *yǐ* ("thus").

Nanbo Zikui said, “Where alone did you hear this?”

**Commentary**
Zikui marveled at Yuyu’s discourse, so lofty and wondrous was its Dao, and thus asked, “From what place did you alone come to hear this?” From this point onward, there are nine layers: the first six pertain to teaching, the latter three to principle—all are the words by which Yuyu instructed Zikui.

She replied, “I heard it from the son of Deputy Ink. The son of Deputy Ink heard it from the grandson of Recitation. The grandson of Recitation heard it from Gazing Clarity. Gazing Clarity heard it from Whispered Assent. Whispered Assent heard it from Waiting Service. Waiting Service heard it from Singing Praise. Singing Praise heard it from Dark Obscurity. Dark Obscurity heard it from Triply Remote. Triply Remote heard it from Doubtful Origin.”

**Commentary**
*Zhu* means “of.” *Fu* means “deputy.” *Mo* means “ink”; ink refers to writing. Since principle gives rise to teaching, writing is called the “deputy.” Just as fish are caught only through the trap, principle is made clear only through teaching. Thus I heard it from writing, for it was by means of written words that understanding first arose.

**Exegetical Note**
Li [Yi] says: *Fu mo* means “that which can serve as deputy to the dark and the inked.” Cui [Yuan] says: All these names below are those of ancients, or perhaps merely figurative—there were no such persons.

**Commentary**
What faces the text is called *fu mo* (“deputy ink”); what turns away from the text is called *luo song* (“recitation”). At first, one relies on the text to generate understanding, thus grasping and reciting it. Next, one gradually awakens to its principle, and so recites it in a flowing manner. Moreover, since teaching arises from principle, it is called the “son”; and since recitation arises from teaching, it is called the “grandson.”

**Exegetical Note**
Li [Yi] says: *Song* means “to penetrate.” It encompasses and flows without obstruction.

**Commentary**
*Zhan* means “to see,” and also “to reach.” Through diligent recitation and the accumulation of effort over time, one gradually perceives the ultimate principle, and the inner chamber of the spirit becomes luminous.

**Exegetical Note**
*Zhan ming*: pronounced *zhan*. Li [Yi] says: “Spiritual clarity, thoroughly penetrating.”

**Commentary**
*Nie* means “to ascend,” and also “to whisper in the ear.” Having delved deeply into recitation and awakened to principle through teaching, the heart rejoices, and one privately assents, whispering to oneself. Though one has heard the Dao, one does not yet dare to practice it openly—this is also a gradual ascent into the wondrous subtlety of the profound.

**Exegetical Note**
*Nie xu*: Xu [Yun] reads *nie* as *nie* (to grasp). Li [Yi] says: *Xu* means “to grant.” To grasp and preserve it, without bestowing it anywhere.

**Commentary**
*Xu* means “to await.” *Yi* means “to employ,” and also “to practice.” Though one privately assents and the light of wisdom gradually brightens, one must still rely on teaching and follow it diligently, practicing without laziness. If one slackens and does not practice, the Dao cannot be attained.

**Exegetical Note**
*Xu yi*: Xu [Yun] reads *xu* as *xu* (“to await”); Li [Yi] reads it as *ru* (“weak”), saying: “Weakness is service.” Wang [Bi] says: *Xu* means “to wait”; *yi* means “to nurture and transform.”

**Commentary**
*Ou* means “song.” Having awakened to principle through teaching and practiced in accord with understanding, one’s abundant kindness becomes manifest, and songs of praise fill the roads.

**Exegetical Note**
*Yu*: pronounced *wu*, or as written. *Ou*: Xu [Yun] reads it as *wu hou*; Li [Xiang] reads it as *xiang yu*, saying: *Ou* means “to nurture,” the appearance of desiring transformation. Wang [Bi] says: *Ou* means “song.”

**Commentary**
Dark Obscurity is so named because it is what is called “non-being” yet is not non-being.

**Commentary**
*Xuan* is the name for what is profound and distant. *Ming* is the term for what is dark and still. Having inwardly merged virtue and outwardly manifested its fragrance, one gradually ascends to the ultimate void, thus reaching Dark Obscurity.

**Exegetical Note**
Li [Yi] says: *Xuan* is a forced name for what is dark; when one looks upon it, it is obscure. Xiang [Xiu] and Guo [Xiang] say: It is so named because it is what is called “non-being” yet is not non-being.

**Commentary**
One who ascends by means of names to reach non-being must attain non-being beyond names. Thus, though it is called Dark Obscurity, it is still not the ultimate, and so it is further entrusted to Triply Remote—this is the “profound within the profound.”

**Commentary**
*Can* means “three.” *Liao* means “remote.” The first is the remoteness of being, the second the remoteness of non-being, and the third neither being nor non-being—thus it is called “triply remote.” Though the realm of Dark Obscurity is wondrous, it is not yet the ultimate, and so only when one reaches the triply remote does one enter the doubly profound.

**Exegetical Note**
*Can*: pronounced *can*. *Liao*: Xu [Yun] reads it as *liao*. Li [Yi] says: *Can* means “lofty.” Lofty, distant, and vast—it cannot be named.

**Commentary**
The principle of spontaneity is such that it is formed through the accumulation of practice. One ascends from the near to the far, refines from the coarse to the fine, and thus only after seven layers does one reach the name of non-being, and only after nine layers does one doubt that non-being is the origin.

**Commentary**
The Dao transcends the four propositions and leaves behind the hundred negations; names and speech are cut off, and the mind’s knowing ceases. Though one has reached the triply remote, its wondrousness is not yet exhausted. Beyond the triply remote lies the root of the Dao—what is called the realm of the doubly profound, the gate of the myriad wonders. Even so, it is difficult to speak of it with precision. Thus, though it is not the origin, it is the origin; though it is the origin, there is no definite origin to which it can be traced. Doubtfully naming it the origin, yet there is no certain origin to which it can be traced—thus it is called Doubtful Origin.

**Exegetical Note**
Li [Yi] says: One further doubts that non-being is the origin, for the origin is not the name of non-being. *Yan cu*: pronounced *yan cu*. *Qi chong*: pronounced *qi chong*. The same below.

Zisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai said to one another, “Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who knows that death and life, existence and extinction, are of one body? I would befriend such a one.”

Four men looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.

**Exegetical Note**
The identities of Zisi and the other three are unverified. Observing their thoughts and conduct, they were all men beyond the mundane world, their affections as pure as still water, forging a bond of unadorned fellowship. They shared a mutual resonance in the realm of the empty and profound, and a communion of wordless understanding in the supreme Dao. Now, man arises from the void and nothingness, and nothingness precedes all—thus nothingness is taken as the head. From nothingness life emerges, and life follows in sequence—thus life is taken as the spine. Having been born, one must die, and death comes last—thus death is taken as the tailbone. Such is the natural order. Though head and tailbone differ, they belong to the same body; though death and life appear distinct, they share a single source. One who grasps this truth finds all circumstances fitting, how then could there be joy or aversion toward existence or extinction? Whoever understands this, I would befriend.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Zisi*: Cui [Yuan] says: In the *Huainanzi*, he is called Ziyong, who at fifty-four suffered from a hunched back.
◎ Qingfan’s note: Cui’s text reads Ziyong, which is correct. The present version of the *Huainanzi*’s “Spiritual Essence” chapter writes Ziqiu, differing from Cui’s edition. Gu Qianli says: *Qiu* should be *yong*. The *Baopuzi*’s “Abundant Analogies” chapter states, “Ziyong marveled at the greatness of heavenly principles,” where the character is correctly written as *yong*. *Yong* and *qiu* are graphically similar, and such mutual errors abound in the classics and transmitted texts.
*Ziyu*: Also written as *Yu*, pronounced *yu*.
*Zili*: Pronounced *li xi*.
*Tailbone*: Pronounced *ku gao*.

Their gaze met and the Dao was present—thus they looked at one another and smiled. Their hearts moved in harmony with the profound principle—thus they were in perfect accord. Soon after, Ziyu fell ill, and Zisi went to inquire after him. He said, “How wondrous is the Creator! To reduce me to this crooked state! My back is hunched, my spine curved, my five viscera exposed above, my chin tucked into my navel, my shoulders towering above my crown, and my nape pointing skyward.” The qi of yin and yang had fallen into disorder, yet his heart remained at ease and untroubled. Hobbling to the well, he gazed at his reflection and said, “Alas! The Creator has once again reduced me to this crooked state!”

Friendship required that he visit his ailing companion, so he followed the principle of things and went—unfettered by what lay beyond the bounds of proper conduct.

"Great indeed is the Creator!" *Wei* means "great." *Zaowu* is akin to *zaohua*, the creative force. *Juju* describes a cramped, contracted, and unyielding state. The vast furnace of creation forges all things without partiality—how could it single out my body alone to afflict with this cramped and twisted malady? In this light, it is nothing but fate. Ziyu, understanding the principle, thus sighed these words.

The hunchbacked curve of his spine left his back bones exposed. Bent forward and unable to straighten, his viscera pressed upward; his chin sank into his navel, his shoulders rose above his crown, and his nape curved like a hook, the great vertebra jutting like a growth. The qi of yin and yang had fallen into disorder and disharmony, leaving his entire body stricken with this severe affliction.

Yet he did not take it as a calamity. Life and death are but one body—how could illness and suffering disturb his heart? Though his form was crooked and contracted, his spirit remained at ease, untroubled by it all.

*Piánxiān*: the gait of one dragging a limp. Hobbling with effort, he approached the well and gazed at his reflection. Seeing his own appearance, he could not help but sigh in lament. For the great Dao follows nature, and the Creator treats all things equally—how could it single me out alone for this cramped and twisted fate? He voiced this sigh to make plain the principle of things.

Zisi said, "Do you resent it?"

Ziyu replied, "No, why should I resent it? Suppose the gradual transformation turned my left arm into a rooster—I would use it to crow at the hours of the night. Suppose it turned my right arm into a crossbow—I would use it to hunt owls for roasting. Suppose it turned my tailbone into a wheel and my spirit into a horse—I would ride them, needing no other mount.

Moreover, to gain is a matter of timing, to lose is a matter of following the natural course. Abiding in the proper time and following the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called 'suspended release,' yet those who cannot release themselves are bound by things. Furthermore, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven—what is there for me to resent?"

"In the phrase *'I would use it to crow at the hours of the night'* (《予因以求时夜》), one edition omits *'seek'* (求). *'Crossbow'* (弹) is pronounced *tú dàn*. *'Owl'* (鸮) is pronounced *hù jiāo*. *'Roast'* (炙) is pronounced *zhì*.

When one encounters the proper time, the world calls it *'gain.'*

Time does not pause even for a moment; following its course and departing, the world calls it *'loss.'*

Gain is birth, loss is death. Sudden gain comes when the time accords with life; swift loss follows when death aligns with principle. Thus, abiding in the proper time, one does not rejoice in life; dwelling in the natural course, one does not resent death. Since there is neither joy nor aversion, how can sorrow or delight enter?

If one cannot release oneself, the myriad things will bind one together. Therefore, those who can release themselves are unbound by anything, while those who cannot release themselves are bound by everything.

Abiding in the natural course and forgetting time, one remains detached and unentangled—this is what the ancients called *'suspended release.'* But those who, while alive, fret over death and harbor aversion in their hearts cannot release themselves inwardly and are thus bound by external things."

(As previously noted, "suspended release" signifies freedom from all attachments.)

Guo Xiang comments: *"Suspended release"* means being unbound by anything.

Another passage states: Heaven cannot be without day and night—how can I be without death and life, and why should I resent them?

The commentary explains: The dark heavens above still alternate between day and night; how much less can man, dwelling in the world, avoid the transformations of life and death? Moreover, things cannot overcome Heaven—this has always been so. Who am I to harbor aversion alone?

Shortly after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if on the verge of death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to visit him and shouted: “Away! Begone! Do not disturb the transformation!” Leaning against the doorframe, he said to him: “How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it fashion you into a mouse’s liver? Or into the arm of an insect?”

Zili’s commentary states: *Huán* means "to encircle." *Chuǎnchuǎn* describes labored breathing. Shortly after Ziyu finished speaking, Zilai fell ill once more, his breath raging as if near death. As the moment of passing approached, his wife and children gathered around him, weeping.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Chuǎnchuǎn* is read *chuǎnzhuǎn* (川轉反), or alternatively *chǐruǎn* (尺軟反). Cui’s edition writes it as *zhuìzhuì* (惴惴). *Huán ér* is read as written, or Xu pronounces it *huàn*. Li explains: "to encircle."

---

The annotation explains: Death and life are but waking and dreaming. In principle, one should accept sleep—why wish to be startled from it? The transformation of death is likewise fitting; there is no cause to be alarmed by it.

The commentary states: *Chì* is a sound of rebuke. The man who roams beyond the worldly sees death and life as one, yet when a friend nears the end, he visits with harmonious light. Thus he rebukes the family, bidding them stand back, for the transformation should not be disturbed.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Chì bì* is read *chìshī* (昌失反). *Wú dá* is read *dīngdá* (丁達反). Cui’s edition writes it as *dá* (靼), pronounced *dá*. *Dá* means "to startle." Zheng Zhong’s annotation of the *Zhouli Kaogongji* reads: "cannot be startled," confirming this.

---

The commentary states: *Yòu* means "again." *Xī* means "what." *Shì* means "to go." Leaning against the doorframe, he observed the transformation and spoke to him. He marveled at the great Creator, vast and impartial, who by chance made him a man, only to return him to change in an instant. Beyond this, where would he go? Into what would he transform? Would his five viscera become a mouse’s liver? Or his four limbs the arm of an insect? Yet wherever transformation leads, all is fitting.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Yǐ qí* is read *yúqǐ* (于綺反). As Xiang explains: "merely discarded into the earth." Wang says: "taking the most insignificant and base." *Chóng bì* (虫臂) is also written as *chóng cháng* (虫肠). Cui’s edition concurs.

---

Zilai said: "For parents, a child follows their command, whether east or west, north or south. Yet the yin and yang of Heaven are even more to man than parents. If they bring me near death and I refuse to heed them, then I am the one who is obstinate—what fault lies with them?

The great earth bears me in form, wearies me with life, eases me with age, and rests me in death. Thus to honor my life is to honor my death.

Now, if a great smith were to cast metal, and the metal leapt up crying, ‘I must become a *Mo* sword!’ the smith would surely deem it an ill-omened metal. Yet when one is cast into the form of a man and cries, ‘A man! A man!’ the Creator must surely deem him an ill-omened man.

Now, if I take Heaven and Earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith, where could I go and not be fitting?" Then he fell into a deep slumber and awoke with a start.

---

The annotation explains: From ancient times, some have defied their parents’ commands, but none have defied the changes of yin and yang or resisted the cycles of day and night.

The commentary states: From here onward is Zilai’s response to Zili as he neared death. A filial son obeys his parents’ commands without hesitation—how much more so the yin and yang of creation, which surpass even one’s parents! Thus while defying a parent’s teaching may occur in the world, resisting yin and yang has never been done.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Bù chì* is read *shīzhī* (詩知反).

---

The annotation explains: Death and life are but day and night, not so distant. When the time for death comes, it is not forbidden, yet to stubbornly refuse it is to resist principle and hasten one’s end. The swiftness of death arises from my obstinacy, not from death itself. *Bǐ* refers to death; since I am alive, I regard death as *bǐ* (the other).

The commentary states: *Bǐ* refers to the Creator. Within the workings of creation, I am brought near death. If I detest death and refuse to follow, then I am the one who resists yin and yang, who rebels against transformation. The fault lies with me—what crime is theirs? Guo’s annotation takes *bǐ* as death.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Bǐ jìn* is read as written. *Zé hàn* is also written as *hàn* (捍), read *hándàn* (胡旦反), or *hàn* (旱). The *Shuowen* states: *hàn* means "to resist."

---

The annotation explains: Principle is always thus.

The commentary states: This reiterates the earlier passage to confirm its meaning. The words are precise, hence their repetition. The explanation of the text does not differ from the previous intent.

---

The annotation explains: "A man! A man!"—he wishes only to remain a man. This is like the metal leaping up, for all know such metal is ill-omened, yet they cannot allow it to transform of its own accord. The Dao of transformation encounters all things without exception. Now, to encounter the form of a man—was this done intentionally? Life is not made by design; it arises of itself in time. To cling to it is surely delusion!

The *Commentary* states: *Xiáng* (祥) means "good." *Fàn* (犯) means "to encounter." *Mò* (镆) is the name of an ancient fine sword. In former times, Ganjiang of Wu forged swords for the King of Wu. His wife was named Moye, so the male sword was named Ganjiang and the female sword Moye. The great furnace and mighty forge smelt and cast metal and iron, shaping them according to the size of the vessel, all without exception. Yet the metal within the furnace suddenly leapt and bounded, earnestly entreating to become a fine sword. The smith was astonished and sighed, deeming it inauspicious. This is like the great forge of nature, carving and shaping all forms—birds, beasts, fish, and insects—each made in its kind. If by chance it becomes a man, one rejoices and cherishes it, earnestly entreating to remain a man. Yet within the workings of creation, this is deemed an ill omen.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Wǒ qiě* (我且) is read as written. Xu reads it as *zǐyú* (子余反). *Mò* (镆) is pronounced *mò* (莫). *Jī* () is read *sìjiē* (似嗟反). *Mò* is the name of a sword.

The *Annotation* explains: All know that metal bound to a fixed form is inauspicious. Thus, by clarifying that one is no different from such metal, the attachment to form may be dissolved. Once dissolved, there is nothing that cannot be.

The *Commentary* states: The two forces of creation are like a furnace and forge, molding and shaping all things, hammering and tempering all living beings. Vast and impartial, they nurture all equally. Whatever is encountered is fitting—what aversion or delight could there be? In the unfolding of transformation, there is nowhere it cannot go.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Dàlú* (大炉) is read *liènú* (劣奴反). *Wū* (恶) is read *wū* (乌). *Kějiě* (可解) is read as written, as below.

The *Annotation* explains: One remains at ease in waking and sleeping, unburdened by thoughts of life and death.

The *Commentary* states: *Chéngrán* (成然) describes a state of leisurely detachment; *qúrán* (蘧然) describes a state of startled joy. *Mèi* (寐) means "to sleep," likened to death. *Jué* (觉) means "to wake," likened to life. Though waking and sleeping differ, when has one not been at ease and carefree? Though life and death are distinct, have they ever not followed fate in free wandering? This concludes the passage where Zilai treats life and death as waking and sleeping.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Chéngrán* (成然) is read as written; Cui concurs. Li says: *Chéngrán* describes a state of relaxed release. Some versions write it as *xū* (戌), read *xù* (恤). Jianwen says it should be *miè* (灭). Another version writes it as *kuò* (□), read *hūkuò* (呼括反), meaning "to look upward." Another version writes it as *éran* (俄然). *Qúrán* (蘧然): Li reads it *qú* (渠). Cui writes it as *jù* (据), also read *qíjù* (其据反). *Qúrán* describes a state of having form. *Jué* (觉) is read *gǔxiào* (古孝反).

Where the Cui edition adds the line *"Fārán hàn chū"* (发然汗出), it notes: "Without constraint, the fluids flow freely." Cui comments: "When *róng* and *wèi* (营卫) harmonize and circulate, one does not fear transformation."

**Collation Notes:**
(1) In the Zhao Jianyi edition, *hàn* (悍) is written as *hàn* (捍).
(2) The character *zhī* (之) is omitted following the Shide Tang edition.
(3) The *Quēwù* (阙误) cites an ancient edition where *chéng* (成) is written as □, stating: "□ is pronounced *hūguō* (呼聒切), meaning 'to look upward.'" It also reads *hōng* (烘), with *méng* (蒙) and □, meaning "obscure."

Zisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang became friends, saying to one another: "Who can join together in non-joining, act for one another in non-acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander through mist, twisting and turning without limit, forgetting life and facing no end?" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so became friends.

**Note 1:**
**Commentary:** Those who embody heaven and earth and darkly merge with transformation—though hands and feet serve different functions, and the five viscera have distinct offices—never join together, yet all joints harmonize as one. This is joining in non-joining. Never acting for one another, yet inner and outer mutually aid each other. This is acting in non-acting. If one were to strain the mind to care for the limbs or move the thighs and arms to manage the viscera, the more one tended to them, the more inner and outer would falter. Thus, one who takes the world as a single body harbors no partiality in action.

**Exegesis:** These three were all transcendent men, darkly merged with transformation, unified in life and death. With shared aspirations and conduct, they became friends. Each followed their true nature and expressed their sentiments, saying: Who can be friends in the spontaneity of emptiness? This is joining without joining, acting without acting—acting without intent to act, joining without intent to join. Like the five viscera, six senses, four limbs, and hundred bones, each has its office and function, mutually serving one another. Yet where is the heart in joining, or attachment in closeness or distance? Though without intent to act for one another, the work of mutual aid is accomplished. Thus, to join in non-joining and act as friends in non-acting—such is the meaning here.

**Philological Notes:**
*Xiāngyǔ* (相与): as written. Cui says: "like kinship." Alternatively read *yù* (豫).
*Xiāngwéi* (相为): as written. Alternatively read *yúwěi* (于伪反).
*Àiwéi* (爱为): read *yúwěi* (于伪反).

**Note 2:**
**Commentary:** Without anything one cannot undertake.

**Exegesis:** *Náo tiǎo* (挠挑) means "to turn and twist." Ascending to heaven shows lofty lightness; wandering through mist shows non-attachment. Thus, one can follow transformation without end, turning and twisting with the Creator.

**Philological Notes:**
*Náo* (挠): Xu reads *érshǎo* (而少反); Guo, Xu, and Yao read *xūyáo* (许尧反).
*Tiǎo* (挑): Xu reads *túliǎo* (徒了反); Guo and Li read *túyáo* (徒尧反). Also written as *zhào* (兆). Li says: "*Náo tiǎo* means 'to turn and twist,' to turn and twist in the vast and boundless." Jianwen says: "the name of circulation."

**Note 3:**
**Commentary:** Forgetting life, one forgets all, and so can follow transformation and change, all without end.

**Exegesis:** *Zhōngqióng* (终穷) means death. Forgetting life and forgetting death, life and death merge as one, and so one follows transformation without end.

**Note 4:**
**Commentary:** If so, how can this be called friendship? It merely illustrates the utmost closeness without the nearness of partial affection.

**Exegesis:** Words forgotten in the realization of meaning, they looked at one another and smiled. Minds darkly merged with the realm, their hearts were in perfect accord. With shared transcendence, they became friends.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) In the Shide Tang edition, *biàn* (变) is written as *ér* (而). The Zhao Jianyi edition omits *fū* (夫) and *zhě* (者).
(2) In the Shide Tang edition, *guān* (官) is written as *guǎn* (管). The Zhao edition renders these two lines as: "though hands, feet, and five viscera differ."

Later, Zisang Hu died, his body unburied. Confucius, hearing of it, sent Zigong to assist with the rites. One strummed a zither, another plucked a lute, and together they sang in harmony: "Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain as men—alas!" Zigong hurried forward and said: "May I ask if singing before the corpse is in accord with ritual?"

**Note 1:**
**Exegesis:** *Mò* (莫) means "none."

The three gazed at one another, silent and wordless. In but a brief moment, Zisang Hu died. When Confucius heard of it, he sent Zigong to offer condolences and instructed him to provide for the funeral arrangements and receive the guests. This was to reveal the distinction between those within and beyond the worldly norms—thus, the roles of the Master and Qin Zhang were invoked.

**Collation Notes:**
*Mòrán* (莫然) is read as written. Cui [Yuan] says: "settled."
*Yǒu xián* (有闲) is read as written. Cui [Yuan] and Li [Xun] say: "a moment." Originally also written as *wéi xián* (为闲).
◎Qing Fan’s note: *Yǒu* (有) in the *Shiwen* is written as *wéi* (为). *Wéi xián* (为闲) is equivalent to *yǒu xián* (有闲). The meaning of *wéi* (为) as "to have" is widely attested. In the *Mencius*, *Teng Wen Gong* chapter: "Whether one will be a gentleman or a rustic," Zhao Qi’s annotation says: "*Wéi* (为) means 'to have'—even a small state has gentlemen and rustics." Again, in the *Disciple* section: "The disciples were silent for a moment," the annotation says: "*Wéi xián* (为闲) means 'a brief moment.'" In the *Jin Xin* chapter: "*Wéi xián* (为闲) without use," the annotation says: "*Wéi xián* (为闲) means 'a moment.'" In the *Liang Hui Wang* chapter: "Simply extend what they do," the *Shuo Yuan*, *Gui De* chapter, quotes *Mencius* with *wéi* (为) as *yǒu* (有). In the *Yan Ce*: "Thus, I dare not offer excuses," the *Xin Xu*, *Za Shi* chapter, writes *wéi* (为) as *yǒu* (有). All serve as evidence.

**[Section 2]**
**[Subcommentary]** *Qū* (曲) means "thin" or "flimsy." Some weave coarse mats or play the zither and sing in harmony, rejoicing together without a trace of sorrow. This is what is called "forgetting life in life," the ultimate attainment beyond the worldly realm.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Biān qū* (編曲): *Bì lián* (必連) in Fanqie; *Bù qiān* (布千) in *Zìlín*; *Fǔ tiǎn* (父殄) in Guo’s reading; *Fǔ lián* (甫連) in *Records of the Grand Historian*.
Li [Yun] says: *Qū* (曲) refers to silkworm trays.

*Xiāng hè* (相和): *Hú wò* (胡卧) in Fanqie.

**[Section 3]**
**[Commentary]** Weeping when others weep is a mark of worldly convention. To equalize life and death, forget grief and joy, and sing before a corpse—this is the ultimate attainment beyond the worldly realm.

**[Subcommentary]** "Alas, come!" is the sound of the song. The lines from "Sanghu" onward are the lyrics of their harmony. *Yī* (猗) is the sound of their responsive singing. For from nonbeing arises being, and this is called life; from being returns nonbeing, and this is called death. Now that you have returned to emptiness and stillness, you have reverted to the root and returned to the true. Yet I still dwell as a sojourner among men, a traveler who has not returned to his mulberry and catalpa. Thus, to equalize life and death, I utter this sigh of *yī*.

◎ Li Zhen says: "Alas, come!" is the sound of the song, yet it is also an expression of lament. *Shì Míng: Shì Yányǔ* states: *Jiē* (嗟) means "to assist"; when words are insufficient to express one’s intent, one utters this sound to aid oneself. *Lái* (來) means "grief"; it draws grief into oneself, hence the words are spoken with a lowered head to summon it. Mencius, turning back, and Ziqin Zhang lament that Sanghu has already returned to the true, and so they sing this song.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Wǒ yóu* (我犹): Cui’s edition has *dú* (独).
*Rén yī* (人猗): *Yú yí* (于宜) in Fanqie. Cui says it is a particle.
*Āi lè* (哀樂): Pronounced *luò* (洛).

**[Section 4]**
**[Subcommentary]** The rites of the worldly realm value restraint and decorum. Even when a neighbor dies, one does not pound grain in mourning. How much less should one remain indifferent before a friend’s corpse, playing the zither and singing as usual—how could this be in accord with ritual? Zigong, astonished at this, hastened forward to ask.

**[Collation]**
(1) The *Shì Dé Táng* edition has *shì* (侍) instead of *dài* (待). *Quē Wù* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition as having *shì* (侍).
(2) The character *shǐ* (使) follows *Shì Míng*.

The two looked at each other and laughed, saying: "How could he know the meaning of ritual!"

**[Commentary]** One who understands the meaning of ritual must wander beyond to order what is within, guard the mother to preserve the child, and follow the truth of one’s feelings without deviation. If one is instead constrained by reputation and bound by form, then filial piety cannot bear sincerity, and kindness cannot bear reality. Father and son, elder and younger brother, harbor feelings and deceive one another—how could this be the great meaning of ritual?

**[Subcommentary]** The great ritual moves in harmony with Heaven and Earth, unbound by form or name. It directly attains authenticity, following feelings without restraint. How much more so when one profoundly unites life and death—how could grief or joy remain in the heart? Yet Zigong is a Confucian scholar of the worldly realm, his nature still partial and attached. He values only coarse traces and has not grasped the wondrous root. What does such a person know of the depth of ritual? To be mocked by those beyond the worldly realm is only fitting.

**[Exegesis]**
*《恶知》* pronounced "wū," same below.
*《称情》* pronounced "chènɡ qínɡ" (chǐ zhènɡ fǎn).
Zǐgòng returned and reported to Confucius, saying: “What manner of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, yet cast off their bodily forms. Facing the corpse, they sang—countenance unchanged—beyond any name to call them. What manner of men are they?”

**[1]**
**[Subcommentary]**
*命* means "name." Zǐgòng returned to report to the Master, saying: Those two men’s feelings and affairs are hard to fathom. They cultivate their own virtue and power, yet possess no ritual propriety, forgetting and casting off bodily form, merging life and death as one. Facing the funeral, they sang with joy—spirit and form unchanged. Since their Dao cannot be fathomed, it is difficult to name them.

**[Exegesis]**
*《无以命之》* Cui and Li say: *命* means "name."

Confucius said: “They are those who wander beyond the bounds of the world, while I wander within them. Outer and inner do not reach one another, and had I sent you to offer condolences, I would have been crude indeed. They are now becoming companions to the Creator, wandering in the single qi of Heaven and Earth. They regard life as an excrescent hanging tumor, death as the bursting of an abscess. If this is so, how could they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from other things, entrusting themselves to a shared body, they forget their liver and gall, abandon their ears and eyes. Reversing and repeating, beginning and ending, they know not where it starts or ends. Vast and drifting beyond the dust and grime, they wander carefree in the work of non-action. How could they possibly trouble themselves with the muddled rites of worldly custom, performing for the eyes and ears of the crowd?”

**[1]**
**[Commentary]**
There is an ultimate principle where inner and outer merge. None who attain the utmost wandering beyond fail to merge with the inner, just as none who merge within fail to wander without. Thus the sage constantly wanders beyond to merge within, acting without intent to follow what is, so that though all day long he manifests form, his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Though he bends and rises amid ten thousand affairs, he is serene and at ease. To see form without reaching spirit is the common burden of the world. Thus, seeing him move among things, none can say he has left things behind or departed from men. Seeing him transform in body and respond to affairs, none can say he sits in forgetfulness, self-content. How could one say the sage is not thus? One must say this is not the ultimate principle. Therefore, Zhuangzi, in clarifying the lineage of the great stream to awaken the world, does not directly attribute this to Confucius. Otherwise, some might rely on what they see to reject it. Thus he transcends the sage’s inner traces and entrusts the beyond to those few. One should forget this entrustment to seek the great meaning of his composition. Then the Dao of wandering beyond to merge within will be clearly and naturally evident, and Zhuangzi’s book will indeed be seen as a discourse that traverses the vulgar to surpass the world.

**[Subcommentary]**
*方* means "realm." Those two men equalize life and death, unbound by the traces of teaching, so their minds wander beyond the universe. While Confucius and Zǐgòng, great Confucians of their age, practice the righteousness of mourning and the rituals of measured conduct, are keenly intent on grief and joy, and wander within the bounds of the world—this is how they differ.

**[Exegesis]**
*《而淡》* pronounced "dàn" (tú zhàn fǎn).
*《而离》* pronounced "lí" (lì zhì fǎn), same below.
*《而应》* means "response," same below.
*《数子》* pronounced "shù zǐ" (suǒ zhǔ fǎn).
*《坦然》* pronounced "tǎn rán" (tǔ dàn fǎn).
◎ Qìngfān notes: *Wén Xuǎn*’s commentary on Xiè Língyùn’s poem "Departing the Capital for My Prefecture" and Xiàhóu Xiàoruò’s *Eulogy for Dōngfāng Shuò* both cite Sīmǎ’s gloss: *方* means "constant," saying they wander in mind beyond the constant teachings. The *Exegesis* omits this.

**[2]**
**[Commentary]**
Condolence is a mundane affair of the bounded world. To apply it to those beyond is crude indeed.

**[Subcommentary]**
Profound and Confucian principles are divided; inner and outer ways differ. Judging by superiority and inferiority, they do not reach one another. Using the vulgar rites of the bounded world to offer condolences to those beyond is like reusing straw dogs—crude in the extreme.

**[Exegesis]**
*《使女》* pronounced "rǔ," same below.

**[3]**
**[Commentary]**
All are obscured in it, thus there is no duality.

**[Subcommentary]**
Comprehending the transformations of yin and yang, one joins the Creator in forming pairs; embodying the undifferentiated unity of the ten thousand things, one roams within the single qi of the Two Modes.
◎ Wang Yinzhi notes: In the "Fit for Emperors and Kings" chapter, it says, *"I am about to join the Creator in forming pairs,"* and Guo [Xiang] comments: *"Allowing others to act of themselves."* In the "Revolutions of Heaven" chapter, it says, *"Qiu does not join in transformation to form pairs,"* and Guo comments: *"One who joins in transformation to form pairs allows things to transform of themselves."* Now, Guo did not understand the meaning of the word *ren* ("pairs"). *Ren* means "to pair"; *wei ren* ("to form pairs") is like saying "to form a pair." The *Doctrine of the Mean* says, *"The humane are those who form pairs,"* and Zheng [Xuan]’s commentary reads: *"Read as the *ren* in *xiang ren’ou* (‘to form a mutual pair’), meaning to preserve one another with human intention."* The *Mao Preface* to the *"Fei Feng"* poem says: *"Those who can divide and cook as pairs, those who can assist in governing the people along the Zhou Way as pairs."* The *Rites of Betrothal* commentary says: *"Bowing at every gate is to show respect by forming a pair."* The *Rites of Feasting a Great Officer* commentary says: *"Bowing at every turn and at the stele is to form a pair with one another."* Thus, *ren* and *ou* share the same meaning, which is why the Han era had the phrase *"forming mutual pairs."* The *"Originating in the Dao"* chapter of the *Huainanzi* says, *"Joining the Creator in forming pairs,"* the meaning of which is the same as here. (High commentary: *"For governance,"* which is incorrect. See the *Huainanzi* for cross-reference.)
The *"Equalizing Customs"* chapter says: *"Above, one befriends the divine luminaries; below, one joins the Creator in forming pairs."* This is clear evidence.
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Yan Yanzhi’s *"Preface to the Third Day of the Third Month at the Winding Waters"* cites Sima [Biao] as saying: *"The Creator is the Dao."* The commentaries on Ren Fang’s *"Letter to the Chief Clerk of the Grand Marshal,"* the *"Edict of Empress Xuande,"* Lu Ji’s *"Inscription on the Stone Pass,"* and Shen Yue’s *"Stele Inscription for the Deceased Prince of Anlu of Qi"* all cite Sima [Biao] as saying: *"The Creator refers to the Dao."* The *Exegesis* omits this.

**[4]**
**[Commentary]**
Like a wart that hangs of itself, a growth that attaches of itself—this is the qi gathering in its time, not something to delight in.

**[Exegesis]**
*《縣》* pronounced *xuán*. The commentary is the same.
*《疣》* pronounced *yóu*.

**[5]**
**[Commentary]**
Like an abscess that bursts of itself, an ulcer that festers of itself—this is the qi dispersing of itself, not something to regret.

**[Subcommentary]**
Those three masters were men who embodied the Dao, who comprehended life and death and were obscured in transformation. Thus, when qi gathers and life arises, it is like a wart or growth attaching and hanging—nothing to delight in; when qi scatters and death comes, it is like an abscess or ulcer bursting and festering—nothing to regret.

**[Exegesis]**
*《決》* Xu [Shen] reads *gǔ xuè*.
*《肒》* pronounced *huàn*.

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current text’s main passage also writes *疣* (with *尤* altered to *丸*), while the pronunciation and meaning give *疣*, read *hú qiú*; this is likely an arbitrary emendation. *《溃》* is read *hú duì*.

◎ Qing Fan’s collation: The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* (vol. 16, under the *Dafangguang Sanjie Jing*) cites Sima [Biao]’s gloss: “Floating heat is an *jū*; blockage is a *yōng*.” The same citation appears in vol. 30 (*Chiren Pusa Jing* 2), vol. 37 (*Zhunti Tuoluoni Jing*), and vol. 95 (*Zhengwu Jing*). The *Shiwen* omits this.

**[6]**
**[Commentary]**
Death and life alternate without end; moving with them, there is nowhere one cannot go—thus one does not know where victory or defeat lies.

**[Subcommentary]**
*先* means “victory”; *后* means “inferiority.” Warts, growths, abscesses, and ulcers are all ailments, yet qi gathers and scatters, and illness knows no victory or defeat. If one compares this to life and death, how can one know where superiority or inferiority lies?

**[7]**
**[Commentary]**
*假* means “to rely upon.” Now, in death and life, gathering and scattering, transformations are boundless—all are different things. There is nothing different that does not rely upon something, so what is relied upon, though different, together forms a single body.

**[Subcommentary]**
Water, fire, metal, and wood—different things rely upon one another; the many depend on this lodging to form a single body. Thus we know the bodily form has always been empty and false.

**[8]**
**[Commentary]**
Entrust it to the principle and proceed in darkness.

**[Subcommentary]**
Having realized that bodily form is empty and false, with nothing to delight in or cherish, one can inwardly forget the viscera and outwardly forget the sense organs.

**[9]**
**[Commentary]**
If even the five viscera are forgotten, what thing is left to recognize? Never having begun to recognize, one can thus roam freely on the path of transformation, darkly merging with the waves of reversal, and not know where beginning and end reach their limit.

**[Subcommentary]**
*端* means “thread”; *倪* means “boundary.” *反复* means “coming and going”; *终始* means “life and death.” Having forgotten bodily form and disabled the senses, one can go and come with life and death, moving together with transformation. Since transformation has no limit, none can know its threads or boundaries.

**[Exegesis]**
*《反复》* read *fāng fú*.
*《端倪》* some editions write *淣*, same character; read *yá*. Xu [Shen] reads *yì*.

**[10]**
**[Commentary]**
The so-called "non-doing as vocation" is not mere folded-hands silence; the so-called "beyond dust and grime" is not seclusion in mountains and forests.

**[Subcommentary]**
*芒然* describes the appearance of utter unknowing. *彷徨* and *逍遥* are both names for self-contented ease. *Dust and grime* refer to the conditioned things of form and sound. Having already relinquished bodily form, one here further forgets mind and intellect, thus roaming beyond the bonds of worldly dust, delighting in the clear and boundless realm, and making this non-doing one’s vocation.

**[Exegesis]**
*《芒然》* read *máng rán*. Li [Yi] says: the appearance of being unbound.
*《彷》* read *páng*. *《徨》* read *huáng*.
*《尘垢》* read as written. Cui [Zhuan] writes *冢□*, saying: *冢* read *zhǒng*; *□* same as *垢*. The people of Qi call wind-dust *□*.
◎ Lu Wenchang says: Formerly *□* was written *逢*; now it is written *摓*, a corruption of *□*. Here corrected.

**[11]**
**[Commentary]**
What they display for the multitude is all dust and grime—it is not the dark reality beyond the realm.

**[Subcommentary]**
*愦愦* means "confused and chaotic." Those several masters are lofty, empty, and serene, arranging nothing and following transformation, following their nature and acting with authenticity. How could they force themselves to observe ritual forms, bind themselves to worldly customs, or display solemn demeanor to please the eyes and ears of the crowd?

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*《愦愦》* read *gōng-nèi* (反切); the *Shuowen* and *Cangjie pian* both gloss it as "chaotic." *《以观》* read *gǔ-luàn* (反切), meaning "to display." The commentary is the same.

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) In the Shide Tang edition, *肒* is written as *疣*; the commentary is the same.
(2) The character *冥* follows the Zhao Jianyi edition. The same applies below. In the Shide Tang edition, the first *冥* is mistakenly written as *私*, and the second as *弘*.
(3) The character *见* follows the Shide Tang edition.
(4) The character *郑* follows the *Zhongyong* commentary.
(5) In the Shide Tang edition, *极* is written as *及*.

Zigong said: "In that case, to which *Dao* does the Master adhere?"

**[Commentary]**
Zigong had not heard of *xing* and the *Dao* of Heaven, so he saw what the Master adhered to but not *how* he adhered to it. That by which he adhered was non-adherence—how could the world perceive this?

**[Subcommentary]**
The *Dao* within the world and the *Dao* beyond it differ in depth. Not knowing which *Dao* the Master followed, Zigong, as disciple to teacher, raised this doubt.

Confucius said: "Qiu is a man under Heaven’s punishment. Nevertheless, I share this with you."

**[Commentary]**
Taking the *Dao* within the world as shackles, it clarifies that what is prized lies in the *Dao* beyond it. Those who roam beyond rely on what is within; those who depart from humanity align with custom. Thus, those who possess all under Heaven do not take all under Heaven as their own. Only by relinquishing things can one enter the multitude; only by sitting in forgetfulness can one respond to affairs. The more one relinquishes, the more one attains. If one dwells in this ultimate state, then even if one wished to cast it aside, principle would naturally come of its own—this is what neither Heaven nor humanity can pardon.

**[Subcommentary]**
The sagely traces and rituals of propriety are but shackles upon form and nature. Since Confucius adhered to the *Dao* within the world, he was by natural principle a man under Heaven’s punishment. Thus, the *Dechongfu* chapter states: "How can one escape Heaven’s punishment?"

**[Commentary]**
Though bound by the world’s shackles, he merely shared this with you. It makes clear that he himself ever remained beyond them.

**[Subcommentary]**
Confucius, the sage, harmonized his light with things and rode the waves of the world, valuing these common rites. Though he descended into the *Dao* within the world and shared it with you, his mind roamed beyond it, detached and unclinging.

Zigong said: "May I ask about this *Dao*?"

**[Commentary]**
He asks about the meaning of roaming beyond while sharing within.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Dao* here means "way." He asks: "Though your traces mingle in the world, your mind roams beyond it—how does this mysterious union of inner and outer come about?"

Confucius said: "Fish come together in water; humans come together in the *Dao*. Those who come together in water dig ponds to secure their sustenance; those who come together in the *Dao* find stability without effort. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; humans forget one another in the arts of the *Dao*."

**[Subcommentary]**
*Come together* means "to go toward." For fish, nothing suits their nature more than deep water; for humans, nothing fulfills their intent more than the arts of the *Dao*. Though their emotions and wisdom differ, both follow this same pattern. This briefly sets forth the meaning, which is explained below.

**[Exegesis]**
*Xiangzao* (相造): read with the falling tone *qibao* (七报反), meaning "to go toward." The same applies below.

**[Annotation 2]**
Though what they go toward differs, both achieve their ends by acting without contrivance—uniting the outer with the inner—so that sustenance is secured and stability arises. All things follow this pattern without exception, yet none are aware of it, and thus the state of *wuwei* (non-action) is realized.

**[Subcommentary]**
This explains the preceding meaning. The Yangtze, lakes, Huai, and seas are all called "heavenly ponds." Fish dwell in the vastness of water, burrowing into mud and sand to nourish and sustain themselves. Likewise, humans abide in the great *Dao*, cultivating clarity and emptiness to nurture their nature, wandering freely without entanglement—thus attaining the tranquility and joy of their inherent stability.

**[Exegesis]**
*Chuanchi* (穿池): some versions write this as *chuandi* (穿地), following Cui’s reading. ◎ Yu Yue notes: *Ding* (定, "stability") is likely a corruption of *zu* (足, "sufficiency"). "Digging ponds to secure sustenance" and "acting without contrivance to attain sufficiency" follow the same structure. *Ji* (给) also means "sufficiency." *Zu* and *ding* resemble each other in form, leading to the error. The *Guanzi*’s "Zhong Kuang" chapter states: "When merit is *established* (*ding*), one gains or loses Heaven’s favor—yet human affairs remain the same." Modern editions mistakenly write *ding* as *zu*, providing mutual corroboration with this passage.

**[Annotation 3]**
When each is self-sufficient and forgets the other, nothing in the world fails to follow this principle. The perfected person is always sufficient, and thus always forgetful.

**[Subcommentary]**
This concludes the explanation of the preceding meaning. Fish swimming in deep waters, each sufficient unto themselves, forget one another; when the arts of the *Dao* fill the inner self, partial attachments dissolve.

Shall this be compared with those who, with moistened breaths, practice benevolence and righteousness—spoken of in the same breath? Facing the corpse and singing, its meaning is likewise thus.

**[Exegesis]**
*Xiangwang* (相忘): pronounced *wang* (as in "forgotten"). The same below.

Zigong said: "I venture to ask about the *jiren* (畸人)."

**[Annotation 1]**
He inquires about those previously referred to as "beyond the norms" (*fangwai*) and unpaired with the common world—where do they reside?

**[Subcommentary]**
*Ji* (畸) denotes "unpaired." Cultivating non-action and externalizing the form, they deviate from human relations and remain unpaired with the world. I venture to ask: what is the *Dao* of such a person?

**[Exegesis]**
*Jiren* (畸人): pronounced *jiyi*. Sima [Biao] says: "Unpaired." Unpaired with others, they are deficient in ritual and teaching. Li [Yi] reads it as *qiyi* (奇异), meaning "extraordinary."

[Confucius] said: "The *jiren* is unpaired with others yet equal to Heaven. Thus it is said: what is a petty person in Heaven’s eyes is a noble person in human eyes; what is a noble person in human eyes is a petty person in Heaven’s eyes."

**[Annotation 1]**
Those who inwardly merge with the Dao roam outwardly. Only by roaming outwardly while inwardly merging, following the spontaneity of the myriad things, allowing each to fulfill its Heaven-given nature and thereby perfecting the Dao of emperors and kings—only then are they unpaired with others yet equal to Heaven.

**[Subcommentary]**
From here onward, Confucius answers Zigong. *Mou* (侔) means "equal" or "the same." Those who do not cultivate benevolence and righteousness, who do not pair with things but follow their original nature, are the same as the principle of spontaneity.

**[Exegesis]**
*Er mou* (而侔): pronounced *mou*. Sima [Biao] says: "Equal," or also "to follow."

**[Annotation 2]**
In terms of natural principle, there is no small or great among humans. In terms of human norms, those who are equal to Heaven may be called noble persons.

**[Subcommentary]**
Those who embrace benevolence and practice righteousness are noble persons; those who deviate from the Dao and violate virtue are petty persons. Thus, those who perform stumbling benevolence and strained righteousness are called noble persons by human standards, yet petty persons by Heaven’s Dao. Hence, Zifan and Qinzhang, unpaired with the world, are called *jiren*—truly noble persons in Heaven’s eyes. The repetition here serves to reaffirm this meaning.

Yan Hui asked Confucius: "Mengsun Cai, when his mother died, wept without tears, felt no grief in his heart, and did not mourn in sorrow. Lacking these three, yet praised for his skill in mourning—he was the most renowned in the state of Lu. Is it truly possible to lack substance yet gain the name?"

**[Annotation 1]**
**[Subcommentary]**
Mengsun, by name Cai, was a worthy man of Lu. Embodying the Dao of non-action and understanding that life and death are not two, he outwardly conformed to worldly norms while his heart roamed beyond things. During his mother’s mourning, he did not neglect ritual, his demeanor was solemn and refined, and his appearance was most filial. Yet his tears did not flow, his heart felt no sorrow, and his voice carried no grief. Lacking these three, he was not called a filial son, yet within his homeland, all praised him, saying he mourned with perfect propriety.

**[Exegesis]**
Mengsun Cai: Li [Yi] says: "A descendant of the Three Huan [families], Cai was his given name." Cui [Zhuan] says: "Cai may also be written as *Niu* (牛)." ◎ Li Zhen notes: "Reading *yi shan chu sang* (以善处丧) as a complete phrase leaves the meaning incomplete and the phrasing awkward. The three characters *gai Lu guo* (盖鲁国) should belong to the preceding clause, not connected to *gu you* (固有) below. This parallels the phrase *gong gai tianxia* (功盖天下) in the *Ying Diwang* chapter, meaning Mengsun Cai’s skill in mourning made him renowned throughout Lu. The *Erya*’s *Shi Yan* states: *Yan*, *gai* also (弇，盖也). The *Xiao Erya*’s *Guang Gu* states: *Gai*, to cover (盖，覆也). The *Shiming*’s *Shi Yanyu* states: *Gai*, to surpass (盖，加也). All convey the sense of rising above, which is the meaning of *gai* here."

**[Annotation 2]**
The people of Lu observed his rituals, while Yan Hui examined his heart.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Gai* (盖) is a particle of introduction. Wailing in sackcloth and hemp, he conformed to the common customs of the world; yet his heart felt no sorrow, aligning with the forgetfulness of those beyond norms. The people of Lu, seeing only his outward conduct, praised his skill in mourning; Yan Hui, perceiving his inner heart, knew he lacked true filial substance. Thus, upon seeing Mengsun Cai, he was moved to doubt and wonder.

**[Textual Note]**
(1) The *Shide Tang* edition omits *chu* (处).
(2) The *Shide Tang* edition writes *yi* (壹) as *yi* (一).

Confucius said: "Mengsun has fully realized it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Though he sought to simplify, he could not; yet he had already simplified. Mengsun did not know why he lived, nor why he died; he did not know to seek what came before, nor what came after. As if transformed into things, he awaited the transformations he did not know—were they yet to come? And while about to transform, how could he know they would not transform? While not yet transformed, how could he know they had already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened!

Moreover, he was startled by the form but his heart remained unharmed; his dwelling changed, yet his emotions did not die. Mengsun alone was awake—others wept, and so he wept too. This was simply his natural response.

Furthermore, we all call it 'I,' but how do we know what we mean by 'I'? Do you dream of becoming a bird and soaring to the heavens, or of becoming a fish and diving into the depths? Do you know whether the speaker now is awake or dreaming? In attaining joy, laughter does not follow; in offering laughter, clapping does not follow. Abiding in spontaneity and departing from transformation, one enters the vast oneness of Heaven."

”One who exhausts the principles of life and death and responds fittingly to both inner and outer circumstances moves in accordance with Heaven’s course—this is no match for knowledge.

Mengsun probed the root of joy and sorrow, thus neither rejoicing nor grieving; he plumbed the source of life and death, thus forgetting both life and death. Since the root and its manifestations are unfathomable, he harmonized inner and outer as fitting. Responding to things without intent, how could this be matched by the workings of knowledge?

Discerning life and death yet finding no difference between them is like the progression of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer. Mengsun discerned but found no difference, just as the four seasons proceed.

Having discerned yet found no difference, there is nothing he does not accept; accepting all, he does not weigh life and death in his mind but entrusts them to spontaneous transformation.

Wherever he encounters, he is at ease.

He does not resist transformation.

First is life; after is death. To follow is to comply. Since he is one with life and death, he neither departs nor approaches; merging with transformation, he complies with it as a thing.

Life and death revolve, becoming one with transformation. Even now, he forgets what he once knew—how could he anticipate what he does not yet know and fret over it?

The transformation not yet known refers to future, untransformed matters. The present life is already forgotten—how much more the transformations yet to come! If one were to use the mind to prepare in advance, it would be better to cease and do nothing.

Having transformed and come to life, how could he know the time before he was born? Not yet transformed and having died, how could he know what comes after death? Thus, there is nothing to avoid or pursue, and he moves together with transformation.

At this moment, he is transforming into a human—how could he know what came before this transformation? Now, in life, he has not yet transformed and died—how could he know what comes after death? One should simply follow reason and proceed with transformation, moving together with it, without needlessly fretting over life or rejoicing in death.

Life and death are but waking and dreaming. Now, in a dream, one takes oneself to be awake—how then can one prove that waking is not a dream? If one cannot prove that waking is not a dream, then one also cannot prove that life is not death. Life and death, waking and dreaming—who knows where they reside? Wherever one encounters them, one finds contentment. Why fret over this while worrying about that?

Dreams occur in the haze of sleep; waking is the clarity of day. Confucius and Yanzi were bound by names and teachings, slumbering in the great dream, not comprehending life and death, never once awakening.”

[9] **Commentary:** These transformations are but the stirring of form, and thus one does not allow life and death to burden the heart.
**Subcommentary:** That Mengsun was profoundly attuned to transformation, perceiving life and death as mere startlings of form, and thus never allowed sorrow or joy to disturb his spirit.
**Philological Notes:** *Hai xing* (骇形) read as written. Cui [Yi] glosses it as "having the form of an infant."

[10] **Commentary:** He regarded the changes of the bodily frame as the daily renewal of a morning abode, and thus his nature did not take it as death.
**Subcommentary:** *Dan* (旦) means "daily renewal." *Zhai* (宅) is the dwelling of the spirit. He saw the body’s transformations as the daily renewal of this dwelling, and thus his serene essence remained untroubled by life and death.
**Philological Notes:** *Dan zhai* (旦宅) read as written. Wang [Bi] says: "Changing from dawn to dusk, the abode is where the spirit resides." Li [Shi]’s edition writes *da* (怛), with the first character read *dan mo* (丹末) and the second *zhi jia* (陟嫁), glossed as "a look of alarm." Cui [Yi]’s edition writes *da zhai* (靼宅), where *da* (靼) means *da* (怛).

[11] **Commentary:** The one who is ever awake encounters nothing that is not fitting, and so when others weep, he weeps too—this is simply what is proper.
**Subcommentary:** Mengsun, in profound unity with life and death, dwelt alone in wakefulness, responding to all things within and without without violating human reason. When others wept, he wept as well, for this was the fitting way to accord with things.
**Philological Notes:** *Suo yi nai* (所以乃): In Cui’s edition, *nai* (乃) is written as *e* (恶).

[12] **Commentary:** Life, death, and transformation—all are mine. Since all is mine, what have I lost? Never having lost myself, what cause have I for sorrow? Without resistance, when others weep, he weeps too; without sorrow, though he weeps, he does not grieve.
**Subcommentary:** My life, my death—all are mine together, never having ceased to be mine. What have I lost? If one clings to what is mine, what is not mine?

[13] **Commentary:** There is nothing that is not mine, and thus the profound unity of inner and outer pervades past and present, ever renewing with transformation—how could one know where I reside?
**Subcommentary:** *Yong* (庸) means "ordinary." Ordinary people, with their shallow and narrow perceptions, how could they know that what I call "mine" is nowhere not present? Though a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations arise, I am ever present. New I, old I—what cause for delight or aversion?
**Philological Notes:** *Yong ju* (庸讵): *Ju* (讵) read *qi shu* (其庶). The same applies in the following section.

[14] **Commentary:** There is nowhere one goes that is not self-fulfilling.

[15] **Commentary:** In dreaming, one takes it for waking—how then can we know that what we call waking now is not also a dream? Or that it is not waking? Since the transformations of waking and dreaming are without limit, the changes of life and death are never worth lamenting.

**Subcommentary:** *Li* (厉) means "to reach." Whether as fish or bird, one follows nature in carefree wandering, abiding in death or life with effortless self-possession. Since fish and bird hold no hierarchy, why should life and death bear superiority or inferiority to bind us? Mengsun mastered this source, and thus never harbored concern. Yet how do we know whether our present discourse on fish and bird unfolds in waking or in dream? In dreams, one takes it for waking; in what we call waking now, who is to say it is not dream? Thus we know: waking, dreaming, life, death—none can be fixed.

[16] **Commentary:** Wherever one arrives is fitting, and thus one forgets the fitting—hence there is no need for laughter. *Pai* (排) means "to shift." Ritual requires that weeping be sorrowful and laughter joyful; if sorrow and joy linger in the heart, one cannot shift with what is fitting. Mengsun was ever fitting, and so wept without sorrow, moving with transformation.

**Subcommentary:** *Zao* (造) means "to reach." *Xian* (献) means "to refine." *Pai* (排) means "to shift." Wherever one reaches is fitting, and this too is fitting—why must one await laughter to be joyful? If one requires external refinement to feel fitting, one cannot follow change or shift with things. Mengsun was ever fitting, and so wept without sorrow.

**Philological Notes:** *Zao shi* (造适): *Zao* read *qi bao* (七报). The commentary is the same.

「On *Xian Xiao* (献笑)」
Xiang [Xiu] says: *Xian* means "refined."
Wang [Bi] says: It means "manifest." When the mind finds fittingness, it manifests in laughter—hence "refined laughter."

Jia Shifu remarks: *Zao shi* (造适) means taking fittingness from the heart alone, forgetting both speech and laughter. *Xian xiao* (献笑) means taking laughter as joy alone, where all shifting dissolves into transformation. Exhausting the power of shifting to rest in profound tranquility, and mastering the function of transformation to transcend it—only then can one roam beyond the ten thousand things and unite with Heaven.

**Philological Notes:**
*Ji pai* (及排): *Pi* read *pi jie* (皮皆反).
*Bi le* (必乐): *Le* read *luo* (洛). The same below.

**Section [17]**
**Commentary:** Abiding in shifting and moving with transformation, one thus enters into stillness and vastness, uniting with Heaven. From here up to Zisi, their attainment is one. The mourning they hold differs, hence their songs and weeping are not the same.

**Subcommentary:** Wherever one is, all is fitting—thus one abides in and follows shifting, never departing from the self, moving with transformation. Such a person alone can enter the wondrous gate of vast emptiness, the singular Dao of spontaneity.

**Philological Notes:**
*Liao* (寥): Also written *liao* (廖), read *li diao* (力雕反). Li [Yi] reads *liang jiu* (良救反).
*Tian yi* (天一): Cui’s version reads: "Creating enemies does not reach laughter; refined mustard does not reach [ ], abiding in shifting does not reach subtlety, subtlety does not reach *xiong piao nian* (雄漂淰), *xiong piao nian* does not reach *dian shi* (簟筮), *dian shi* alone enters into *liao tian yi* (漻天一)."
*Yi shang* (以上): *Shang* read *shi zhang* (时掌反).

**Textual Variants:**
(1) Zhu Guiyao’s edition reads *nai* (乃) as *ying* (盈).
(2) Shide Hall edition reads *wang* (往) as *sheng* (生).
(3) Shide Hall edition reads *yi* (以) as *si* (似).
(4) Zhao Jianyi’s edition omits the initial *fu* (夫) in the commentary and the final *ye* (也).
(5) Shide Hall edition reads *shi wu* (是吾) as *zi wu* (自吾), and both *zai* (哉) as *yi* (矣).

Yierzi sought an audience with Xu You.
Xu You said: "How did Yao equip you?"

**Commentary:** *Zi* (资) means "to supply and aid."

**Subcommentary:** Yier was a worthy of antiquity. *Zi* means "to supply and aid." Yier first paid respects to Emperor Yao, then met Zhongwu. He asked: "Emperor Yao is a great sage, his virtue and Dao most lofty. Since you have met him, what teachings of respect, supply, and aid did he impart? I humbly request you to recount them."

**Philological Notes:**
*Yierzi* (意而子): Li [Yi] says: a worthy scholar.
*Zi ru* (资汝): *Zi* means "to supply."

Yierzi said: "Yao told me: 'You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness, and clearly speak of right and wrong.'"

**Subcommentary:** *Gong* (躬) means "oneself." Benevolence is compassionate nurturing of things; righteousness is decisive judgment and correction of wrongs. "Right" means clearly rewarding the good; "wrong" means clearly punishing the evil. These four are what human relations esteem. You must personally practice them and also clearly speak of them to others. This is Yier recounting Yao’s instruction.

Xu You said: "Why have you come here? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness, and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you roam the path of boundless freedom, unconstrained wandering, and ceaseless transformation?"

**Subcommentary:** *Er* (而) means "you."

"Why" means "what." *Zhi* (轵) is a grammatical particle. Yao has already inflicted the harm of teaching and punishment upon you—your wounds are already severe. Why have you come again?

**Explanation of Characters:** *Wei zhi* (为轵) is pronounced *zhǐ* (之 is the fanqie initial); Guo [Xiang] reads it as *rěn* (忍). Cui [Zhu] says: *zhi* means "particle." Li [Yi] says: it means "this."

**Commentary:** This speaks of how one will mutilate and cripple oneself with penal teachings, unable to roam again in the realm of self-attainment or the path unbound by constraints.

**Subcommentary:** *Qing* (黥) means "to tattoo the forehead." *Yi* (劓) means "to cut off the nose." *Zisui* (恣睢) means "unrestrained." *Zhuanxi* (转徙) means "transformation." *Tu* (涂) means "Dao/Way." Now, benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong injure one’s true nature—their harm is comparable to punishment. Since you have already been branded and mutilated by Yao, your nature and emotions constrained, how can you again roam with self-attainment, wander freely and uninhibited, or move with ease along the Dao of transformation? This means you will no longer be able to do so.

**Explanation of Characters:** *Qing* (黥) is pronounced *qíng* (其京反).

"Yi" (劓) is pronounced *yúqì* (鱼器反). Li [Yun] says: To ruin the Dao/Way and virtue/power in the name of benevolence and righteousness—is this not like being tattooed? To shatter the unity of the primordial in the name of right and wrong—is this not like having one’s nose cut off?

"Yaodang" (遥荡): Wang [Bi] says: "Unfettered and scattered."

"Zi" (恣): Pronounced *qīzī* (七咨反), or as the character is read.

"Sui" (睢): Guo [Xiang] and Li [Yi] say: Pronounced *xǔwéi* (许维反); Xu [Shen] says: *xǔbí* (许鼻反). Both Li [Yi] and Wang [Bi] say: "Zisui" (恣睢) means "the appearance of self-attainment."

"Fuyou" (复游): Pronounced *fúyòu* (扶又反). The same below.

Yi’erzi said: "Even so, I still wish to roam within its fence."

**Annotation:** *[He] does not dare again seek to tread the central Way, but only wishes to roam along its outer fence.*

**Subcommentary:** Though I have suffered such mutilation, my hope remains unabated. No longer daring to walk the central path, I wish only to tread the fence at the Way’s edge.

**Explanation of Characters:** "Qifan" (其藩): Pronounced *fǔfán* (甫烦反); Li [Yi] reads it as *fán* (烦). Sima [Biao] and Xiang [Xiu] both say: "Cliff." Cui [Zhuan] says: "Boundary."

Xu You said: "Not so."

The blind have no part in the beauty of brows, eyes, and complexion; the blind musicians have no part in the spectacle of blue, yellow, *fu*, and *fu* patterns.

**Subcommentary:** The blind have eyes but cannot see objects; the blind musicians have eyes like drumskin, without seams. Since the eyes of the blind and blind musicians are ruined, they cannot observe the colors of blue and yellow, nor do they delight in the beauty of brows, eyes, and complexion. This is like Yi’erzi, who suffered the mutilations of Yao—his emotions and wisdom were already impaired. How could he cherish deep mysteries or behold the manifold wonders?

**Explanation of Characters:** "The blind" is also written as *miǎo*. Cui’s version has *mù* (目), noting: *mù* may also be written as *xíng* (刑), meaning "mutilation" (tattooing and nose-cutting). "Have part in" is pronounced *yù*; the same below. "Beauty" is read as written, or alternatively *hūbào*. *Fu* is pronounced *fǔ*; *fu* is pronounced *fú*. "Spectacle" is pronounced *guàn*.

Yi’erzi said: "The loss of Wu Zhuang’s beauty, the loss of Ju Liang’s strength, and the loss of the Yellow Emperor’s wisdom—all occurred within the forge and hammer’s span. How do we know the Creator will not cease my tattooing and mend my nose-cutting, allowing me to ride completion and follow you, Master?"

**Annotation:** This speaks of the things under heaven—not all necessarily complete themselves. The principle of spontaneity also requires smelting and forging to become vessels. Thus, these three individuals all heard the Dao and afterward forgot their former pursuits. This is all figurative speech, meant to dispel the burdens of clouded action.

**Commentary:**
Wu Zhuang was a beauty of ancient times who, upon hearing the Dao, no longer adorned herself and thus forgot her own beauty. Ju Liang was a man of great strength in ancient times who, upon hearing the Dao and embracing femininity, no longer exerted his strength. The Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, possessed sagely wisdom, yet upon hearing the Dao, he too was able to relinquish his knowledge. A *lu* is a furnace; a *chui* is a hammer. These three individuals, having heard the Dao, thereafter forgot their former pursuits to align with their true nature—just as worldly vessels rely on the furnace and hammer’s forging to fulfill their use. Why then should the principle of spontaneity preclude the Master from instructing me to perfect the Dao? Thus, we know that the spontaneous workings of creation unfold within the furnace’s span, implying the necessity of cultivation and forging through study.

**Explication of Terms:**
*"Wu Zhuang" and "Ju Liang"* – Sima Biao states: both are personal names. Li Yi says: *Wu Zhuang* means "without adornment"; *Ju Liang* means "unyielding strength."
*"Lu"* – pronounced *lu* (furnace).
*"Chui"* – also written as *chui* (hammer). Xu Shen reads it as *zhuì* (to strike), also *zhī*, or in one reading, *shí*. Li Yi says: a *chui* is a fire-blowing tool with a hawk’s head and a hooked mouth. Cui Shannan says: *lu* refers to a jar; *chui* should be written as *zhuì*. The phrase *"between lu and zhuì"* signifies a small space. *Zhuì* is pronounced *zhàngwěi*.
*"Duan"* – pronounced *duàn* (to forge).

**Annotation:**
That which follows one’s nature directly is spontaneity. If one proceeds and harms their nature, yet upon harming it is able to change—this too is spontaneity. How do we know that my nature’s spontaneity will not cease the tattooing and mend the nose-cutting, allowing me to ride the attainable Dao and follow you, Master? To abandon me without instruction would hardly be the ultimate work of creation.

**Commentary:**
"Creation" here means the transformative workings of nature. Though I have suffered the mutilations of benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong—damaging my nature—how do we know that within creation’s workings, the nose-cutting will not be mended and the tattooing ceased, enabling me to reform and renew, to ride the attainable Dao and follow you, Master, seeking further guidance? To cast me aside without teaching would be contrary to the Creator’s intent.

◎Qing Fan’s Note:
*Cheng* (to ride) means "to bear" or "to carry." *Cheng* (completion) means "perfection," akin to the phrase *"the rites are now complete"* in the *Book of Songs*. Tattooing and nose-cutting mar the body’s wholeness; to cease and mend them is to restore completion. This speaks of the Creator allowing me to encounter the Master—how do we know I will not be made to bear a perfected form and follow you? This interpretation draws from Xuan Shi’s reading, which surpasses Guo Xiang’s.

**Textual Variants:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *chui* as *chui* (hammer).
(2) Zhao’s edition writes *xing* (nature) as *ran* (thus).
(3) The Shidetang edition writes *"know I"* as *"I know."*
(4) The Shidetang edition omits the character *ye* (also).

Xu You said: "Alas! It cannot be known."

Here is the translation:

---

"I shall speak to you of its general outline.

O my Master! O my Master!
You are all things yet do not act for *yi*,
You bestow blessings upon ten thousand generations yet do not act for *ren*,
You are older than high antiquity yet do not count as old,
You cover and bear heaven and earth, carve and shape all forms, yet do not count as skillful.
This is the realm in which you wander."

**Annotations:**
(1) The *Shu* (疏) notes: *Yi* (噫) is an exclamation. The supreme Dao is profoundly mysterious, beyond words and images, unmeasurable by thought—hence the sigh that it "cannot be known." Since Xu You’s request was earnest, it would be improper to remain silent; though the Dao cannot be fully expressed in words, I shall outline its rough contours for you.
The *Shiwen* (釋文) records: *Yue yi* (曰噫) — Xu pronounces it as *yi* (medical tone). Li [Yi] says: an exclamation. Cui [Yuan] says: disorder. Originally also written as *yi* (意), same pronunciation. Alternatively, read as the character itself, meaning "to call out *yi* by name."
*Wo wei* (我為) — pronounced *yu wei* (于伪反). The annotation is the same.

(2) **Annotation:** All is thus of itself; there is no deliberate love at work—where would *ren* and *yi* reside?
**Shu:** "O my Master!" refers to the supreme Dao. Since the supreme Dao cannot be grasped by the heart, I shall speak briefly of its essentials—namely, that my Master is thus. *Sui* (碎) means "to shatter." For example, when autumn frost descends and shatters the myriad things, is there any intent to sever or judge as *yi*? When spring’s harmonious *qi* nurtures and gives life to the myriad things, is there any intent of affection to count as *ren*? It is simply not so, yet so it is. Since Xu You takes the supreme Dao as his Master, and the supreme Dao is as such, how can you personally practice *ren* and *yi*? This is a rough explanation of the method for ceasing tattooing and mending nose-cutting.
**Shiwen:** *Sui* (碎) — pronounced *zi xi* (子兮反). Sima [Biao] says: to shatter. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The *Shuowen* writes it as *□*, also as *yan* (兖). Lu [Deming] always follows *chi* (敕), which is an error. Here, it follows the clerical script’s abbreviated form. The same applies below.

(3) **Annotation:** It is ever-renewing.
**Shiwen:** *Zhang yu* (長於) — pronounced *ding zhang* (丁丈反).

(4) **Annotation:** It is natural, hence not skillful.
**Shu:** Before the myriad forms existed, this Dao was already present, complete in wisdom and *de*—hence it is metaphorically called "elder" (*zhang*), though in reality it is not long. If there is no "long," how can there be "old"? This clarifies that it is "long yet not long," "old yet not old"—hence "older than high antiquity yet does not count as old." Though it covers like heaven and bears like earth, the Dao is the source; though all forms are carved and shaped, they all rely on creation, all receiving the natural endowment—hence the name of "skill" is extinguished. Since it is neither old nor skillful, neither right nor wrong, what can you clearly articulate?

(5) **Annotation:** To wander in non-action and take the teacherless as one’s teacher.
**Shu:** The realm in which my Master wanders is only as described above. This summarizes the meaning of "my Master" from the preceding passage.

Yan Hui said: "I have gained."
(1) **Annotation:** To take reduction as gain.
**Shu:** Yanzi received the teaching of Confucius, cherished it in his heart, and sought the Dao. Realizing his own progress, he presented his understanding to his teacher. Reducing the full to attain emptiness—hence taking reduction as gain.

Zhongni said: "What do you mean?"
(1) **Shu:** Since you say you have gained, what is the meaning?

He said: "I have forgotten *ren* and *yi*."
(1) **Shu:** He forgot the *ren* of universal love and abandoned the *yi* of judging right and wrong. What he called "gain" refers to this!

He said: "That is acceptable, but it is still not enough."
(1) **Annotation:** *Ren* is the trace of universal love; *yi* is the achievement of shaping things. Love is not *ren*, yet the trace of *ren* is enacted; shaping is not *yi*, yet the achievement of *yi* appears. Retaining *ren* and *yi* is insufficient to understand that the origin of love and benefit lies in the absence of intent—hence forgetting them is acceptable. But if one only forgets the achievements and traces, one has not yet attained profound understanding.
**Shu:** Having forgotten *ren* and *yi*, one gradually aligns with principle; yet the depth of understanding is still shallow, so it is still not enough.
**Shiwen:** *Gong xian* (功見) — pronounced *xian bian* (賢遍反). The same below.

On another day, he met again and said, "Hui, you have improved!"

**Shu:** *On another day*—meaning on a different day. With empty understanding renewed daily, he met again at another time. The progress spoken of is listed below.

**Shiwen:** *On another day*—Cui’s edition reads *on a different day*. The same below. *Met again*—pronounced *fú yòu*. The same below.

He asked, "What do you mean?"

**Shu:** What is meant by *improved*?

He replied, "Hui has forgotten ritual and music."

**Shu:** Ritual is the foremost cause of disorder, and music is the instrument of excess—these burdens are even heavier, so they are forgotten next.

He said, "That is acceptable, but it is still not enough."

**Annotation:** Ritual is the function of the physical form, and music is the instrument of joy in life. To forget the instrument is not as profound as forgetting that which gives rise to the instrument.

**Shu:** Though the mind is gradually becoming empty, it has not yet reached the ultimate.

**Shiwen:** *Joy in life*—pronounced *luò*, also *yuè*.

On another day, he met again and said, "Hui, you have improved."

He asked, "What do you mean?" **Annotation:** This is no different from the previous explanation.

Yan Hui replied, "Hui has attained *sitting-in-forgetfulness*." **Annotation:** With an empty mind free from attachment, one can sit upright and forget. The meaning of *sitting-in-forgetfulness* is fully expounded below. **Qingfan’s Note:** In *Wen Xuan*, the commentary on Jia Yi’s "Fu on the Owl" cites Sima’s gloss: "Sitting and forgetting one’s own body." The *Shiwen* omits this.

Confucius started and said, "What do you mean by *sitting-in-forgetfulness*?" **Annotation:** *Starting* describes his shocked and startled demeanor. Having forgotten so profoundly, he was moved to astonishment and admiration. What is meant by *sitting-in-forgetfulness*—what does this term signify? **Shiwen:** *Starting* (蹴然) is pronounced *zǐ liù*. Cui says: "A change of countenance."

Yan Hui replied, "Discarding the limbs and body, dismissing hearing and sight, parting from form and abandoning knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called *sitting-in-forgetfulness*." **Annotation:** *Discarding* means to destroy and abandon. *Dismissing* means to cast aside. Though hearing belongs to the ears and sight to the eyes, the function of hearing and sight originates in the mind’s intelligence. Having awakened to the truth that the body is not one’s own and all phenomena are empty, one can destroy and abandon the four limbs and the hundred parts of the body, and banish the intelligence of hearing, sight, and the mind. **Shiwen:** *Discarding* (堕) is pronounced *xǔ guī*; Xu also reads it as *dài guǒ*. **Annotation:** What is there that one does not forget in *sitting-in-forgetfulness*? Having forgotten the traces, one also forgets that which gives rise to the traces. Within, one is unaware of one’s own body; without, one does not recognize heaven and earth. Only then can one merge with transformation as one’s very substance and become thoroughly pervaded. **Annotation:** The *Great Thoroughfare* is the Great Dao. The Dao can bring forth and nourish the myriad things, hence it is called the *Great Thoroughfare*. Externally, one dissolves the form and body, seeing each as empty and illusory—this explains *discarding the limbs and body*. Internally, one removes the mind’s knowledge, becoming utterly unaware—this explains *dismissing hearing and sight*. Having become like withered wood or dead ashes, one darkly merges with the Great Dao. Such progress is called *sitting-in-forgetfulness*. **Shiwen:** *Abandoning* (去) is pronounced *qǐ lǚ*. *Knowledge* (知) is pronounced *zhì*. Cui says: "*Sitting-in-forgetfulness* means sitting upright and forgetting." **Lu Wenchang’s Note:** This should follow *starting* in sequence.

Confucius said, "To merge is to be without preferences; to transform is to be without constancy. And you are truly worthy! I, Qiu, ask to follow after you." **Annotation:** When nothing is not the same, there is nothing one does not find fitting. When there is nothing one does not find fitting, how can there be likes or dislikes? **Shiwen:** *Without preferences* (无好) is pronounced *hū bào*. The note is the same. *How can there be dislikes?* (何恶) is pronounced *wū lù*. **Annotation:** One who merges with transformation follows only where transformation leads, hence there is no constancy. **Annotation:** Having merged with the Great Dao, one is without right or wrong, likes or dislikes. Having become one with transformation, one does not cling or abide in constancy. **Annotation:** *Truly* means certainly. *You* means you, Yan Hui. "Having forgotten to such an extent, you are certainly a great worthy. Though I, Qiu, am your teacher, I now fall behind you. To follow and learn from you—this is my wish." This expresses humility, yielding to oneself in order to advance Yan Hui.

Ziyu and Zisang were friends. When it rained continuously for ten days, Ziyu said, "Zisang is likely in distress!" He wrapped some rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard something between singing and weeping, accompanied by the zither: "Father! Mother! Heaven!"

"Alas, man!"

There was something in his voice that could not bear its own sound, yet he hastily recited his verse.

**Annotation:** These two acted for one another in a way that was no act at all. Now, wrapping rice to feed him arises from the natural principle of heaven and is simply so of itself—it is not that one acts for the other and only then goes.

**Annotation:** Rain lasting three days or more is called *lin*. *Dai* means "nearly." Zisang was poor; with this continuous rain, he was nearly starving. This matter is beyond doubt an example of friendship beyond the ordinary, where one follows principle in going—though he wrapped rice to bring, there was no sentiment of acting for the other.

**Textual Note:** *Lin yu* (霖雨) is also written as *lin* (淋), pronounced *lin*. The *Zuozhuan* states: "Rain lasting three days or more is called *lin*." *Guo* (裹) is pronounced *guo*. *Shi* (食) is pronounced *si*, with the same pronunciation in the annotation.

**Annotation:** *Ren* means "to bear." *Qu* means "sudden and swift." Zisang, having suffered from hunger, thus produced the sound of the zither, asking from whom this hunger and poverty came—was it from father and mother? Or from man and heaven? This was the meaning of his song and weeping.

Unable to bear this act, he suddenly burst into poetic song.

**Textual Note:** *"You bu ren"* (有不任) is pronounced *ren*. *"Qi sheng er qu"* (其聲而趨) is read with *qu* as *qizu*. Cui [Yuan] says: "Not bearing its sound means exhaustion; suddenly reciting his poem means having no melody or tune."

**Collation Note:** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *lin* (淋).

Ziyu entered and said, “Why do you sing your poem like this?”

**Annotation:** He suspected it carried emotion, which was why he hurried out to distance himself from principle.

**Commentary:** One with death and life, forgetting sorrow and joy, [joining] in non-joining—this is friendship beyond the ordinary. Now you sing your poem as if harboring resentment, so I entered in surprise and asked the reason.

He replied, “I pondered who brought me to this extremity but could not find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? The heavens cover without partiality, the earth bears without partiality—would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one who caused this but could not find them. Yet I have come to this extremity—it is fate, is it not?”

**Annotation:** All things are natural; there is no doer.

**Commentary:** Parents in their kindness would not wish their child to hunger or freeze; heaven and earth are impartial—how could they alone impoverish me? Considering the master [of fate], all is spontaneous; seeking the cause, no sign appears. That I have come to such extremity is simply my allotted fate—what is there to resent?

The annotation states: One who is without intention and allows all things to transform spontaneously is fit to be an emperor-king.

**Explanation of Text:** Cui [Yuan] says: To practice the teaching without words, causing all under heaven to naturally regard themselves as oxen or horses—this is what it means to be fit as an emperor-king.

Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times received no answer. Nie Que then leapt up in great joy and went to report this to Master Pu Yi.

**Annotation:** The four questions with four non-answers refer to the four questions in the "Equalizing Things" chapter. The Way of the emperor-king is nothing like the forgetting of knowledge, and thus this meaning serves as the opening of the chapter. Laozi said: "One who governs the state with wisdom is a thief of the state’s virtue."

**Explanation of Text:**
*Nie Que*: Pronounced as five-jie (knot) in reverse.
*Below*: Pronounced as qiu-yue (hill-joy) in reverse.
*Wang Ni*: Pronounced as wu-xi (five-stream) in reverse.
*Four questions with four non-answers*: Xiang [Xiu] says: This matter is found in the "Equalizing Things" chapter.

Master Pu Yi said, "So now you have come to know it? The Lord of Yu did not measure up to the Lord of Tai.

The Lord of Yu still concealed benevolence to entice people; though he gained people, he had not yet emerged from the realm of the unnatural. The Lord of Tai, however, lay in tranquil ease, awoke in carefree leisure; now taking himself for a horse, now taking himself for an ox; his knowledge was true and sincere, his virtue profoundly genuine, and he had never entered the realm of the unnatural."

**Annotation:** Master Pu Yi was a worthy man of Yao’s time, eight years of age, whom Shun took as his teacher. He declined the throne when offered, and was also known as the Master Clad in Straw. Nie Que, having grasped the wondrous principle of non-knowing, leapt up in joy and ran to tell Master Pu Yi, recounting Wang Ni’s profound meaning. Pu Yi was a great worthy beyond the world, who had attained the ultimate Way of forgetting words. The principle of non-knowing is fundamentally enduring—only now have you come to know it?

**Explanation of Text:**
*Master Pu Yi*: The *Shizi* states: Pu Yi was eight years old when Shun yielded the throne to him.
Cui [Yuan] says: He was the one clad in straw, Wang Ni’s teacher.
The *Huainanzi* says: Nie Que sought the Way from the one clad in straw.

**Annotation:** The Lord of Yu and the Lord of Tai are both traces of worldly affairs, not that which leaves the traces. That which leaves the traces is traceless—who in the world could name it? Never having been named, how could there be victory or defeat? Yet the traceless one rides the transformations of the multitude, treads through the ages; the world has its level and perilous times, and thus the traces may fall short.

**Annotation:** The Lord of Yu refers to Shun. The Lord of Tai refers to Tai Hao Fu Xi. In the age of the Three Sovereigns, customs were pure and harmonious; in the time of the Five Emperors, the winds were shallow and competitive.

The age of strife and competition relies on cunning to nurture things, while the age of purity and harmony entrusts itself to authenticity to govern the world—thus the meaning of "falling short" may be understood.

**Annotation:** As for *Tai Hao*, Sima [Biao] says: an ancient sovereign. Cui [Zhuan] says: an emperor. Li [Yi] says: the Great Courtyard Clan; also says: the nameless ruler. **Qingfan’s Note:** The *Lushi Qianji* 7 cites Sima [Biao] as saying: "An ancient sovereign, a nameless designation," slightly differing from the *Shiwen* citation.

The one who takes what he likes as the right person and what he dislikes as the wrong person is confined to the realm of right and wrong. He who can emerge from the realm of the wrong person must enter the state where there is no wrong person—thus there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong. How could this be merely concealing virtue to entice others?

**Annotation:** Shun concealed benevolence and righteousness, seeking the allegiance of the people to win their hearts—this was not yet forgetting the self to harmonize with the world, and so he had not emerged from the realm of right and wrong. Some texts write *zang* (藏) as *zang* (臧), meaning "good." To be good at benevolence and righteousness is to seek the hearts of others.

**Annotation:** Where the human perspective remains, one demands virtuous conduct from others. Where the human perspective vanishes, one moves among birds and beasts without confusion. In one’s dealings with others, one drifts in the boundless merging of all things—why would one seek to entice others? Emerging from the non-human, one forgets the distinction of "not-me." Entering the non-human, the duality of self and other is forgotten—one does not respond with the heart. Whether as horse or ox, one forgets not only others but also the self.

**Annotation:** *Xu xu* describes a leisurely, unhurried manner; *yu yu*, a self-contented demeanor. In the time of Fuxi, the pure wind still prevailed, so when he lay down, he was at ease and unhurried; when awake, he was joyful and self-contented.

**Annotation:** *Xu xu*: as written. Cui [Zhuan] writes it as *qu qu*. *When awake*: *jue*, pronounced *gu xiao*. *Yu yu*: as written. Sima [Biao] says: *Xu xu* means composed and steady; *yu yu* means without knowledge. Simplified Text says: *Xu xu yu yu* describes the state of sleep. **Qingfan’s Note:** *Yu yu* is the same as *xu xu* (盱盱). The *Shuowen* says: *Xu* means to open the eyes wide. *Yu* and *xu* are phonetically and semantically close. The *Huainanzi’s* *Chuzhen* chapter says: "The myriad people were *sui sui xu xu*." The *Lingguangdian Fu* says: "The simplicity of the primordial age was *sui xu*." Zhang Zai explains: "*Sui xu* describes a guileless form." This aligns with Sima’s note on "without knowledge." The *Huainanzi’s* *Lanming* chapter says: "Lying down, they were *ju ju*; rising, they were *xu xu*." Gao You’s commentary says: "*Xu xu* means without cunning or skill." Elsewhere in the *Huainanzi*, *xu xu* is written as *mian mian*. Wang Niansun’s *Dushu Zazhi* cites various texts to argue that these are corruptions of *xu xu*, both meaning "guileless and unknowing."

If this is so, how could there be right and wrong persons? This may be called emerging from the realm of the wrong person.

**Annotation:** Forgetting self and other, leaving behind right and wrong, one may be called horse or ox at another’s beckoning. If even the distinction between human and beast is absent, how could there be right and wrong?

**Annotation:** Entrusting oneself to natural knowledge, one’s feelings are sincere.

**Annotation:** Following one’s true knowledge, one’s nature is without pretense—thus it is genuinely sincere.

**Annotation:** Entrusting oneself to natural attainment, one is without falsity.

**Annotation:** Taking non-virtue as virtue, virtue has no object—thus one is without falsity.

**Annotation:** Not entering the realm of right and wrong is how one transcends the age of Youyu.

**Annotation:** Having followed one’s nature and kept virtue unfeigned, one can surpass the bounds of conscious knowledge and not enter the realm of right and wrong.

**Collation:** Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *zang* (藏) as *zang* (臧).

Jianwu met the madman Jieyu. Jieyu said: "What did Rizhong Shi tell you?"

**Annotation:** Jianwu and Jieyu have been explained earlier. Rizhong Shi was a worthy man, the teacher of Jianwu. Since he was your teacher, what did he instruct you? This is Jieyu posing the question.

**Annotation:** *Ri* (日): *ren shi*. *Zhong* (中): *zhong*, or as written. *Shi* (始): Li [Yi] says: Rizhong Shi was a worthy man. Cui’s edition omits the character *ri* (日), saying: "Zhong Shi was a worthy man." **Yu Yue says:** The *Shiwen* cites Li [Yi] saying Rizhong Shi was a worthy man’s name, which is likely incorrect. *Zhong Shi* is the name; *ri* means "the one who says." The question is: "What did the one who says, Zhong Shi, tell you?" In the *Zuozhuan*, Year 7 of Duke Wen: "The one who says: the state of Wei is not harmonious." Year 26 of Duke Xiang: "The one who says: he will pass by here." Year 7 of Duke Zhao: "The one who says: the lord considers Gongsun Duan capable of handling the matter." Year 16 of Duke Zhao: "The one who says: let us request the jade ring." All these instances of *ri* share the same meaning. Li [Yi] takes *Rizhong Shi* as a three-character name, which is mistaken. Cui’s edition omits the character *ri*.

**Annotation:** *Yuyu* (以语): *yu ju*. *Nu* (女): *ru*. The same applies hereafter.

Jianwu said: "He told me that a ruler of men, issuing standards, models, principles, and measures from himself—who would dare not listen and be transformed?"

---

"[...] **Annotation [1]:** *Shi* (式) means 'to employ.' Teaching me the Way of being a ruler and the methods of transforming things requires issuing wisdom from oneself to order and regulate, and employing benevolence and righteousness to guide customs. Then, who among the common people of the four directions would not listen and obey? How could the distant masses dare not submit and be transformed?

**Explication of Pronunciation and Meaning:** *Chu jing* (出经) is a complete phrase. Sima [Biao] says: *chu* (出) means 'to enact'; *jing* (经) means 'constant.' Cui [Yuan] says: *chu* (出) means 'to issue from'; *fa* (法) means 'standards.' *Shi yi du ren* (式义度人) is a complete phrase. *Shi* (式) means 'model'; Cui [Yuan] says: *shi* (式) means 'to employ'; to employ benevolence and righteousness to model and regulate people.

◎ Wang Niansun says: The *Explication of Pronunciation and Meaning* states that *chu jing* is a complete phrase and *shi yi du ren* is a complete phrase, but the explanations cited are not harmonious. In this case, *yi ji chu jing shi yi du* (以己出经式义度) should form one phrase, and *ren shu gan bu ting er hua zhu* (人孰敢不听而化诸) another. *Yi* (义) should be read as *yi* (仪). (*Yi* [义] and *yi* [仪] are interchangeable in ancient script. The *Shuowen* says: *yi* (义) is the dignity and bearing of oneself. In the *Wenhou zhi ming*, *fu yi he* (父义和) is glossed by Zheng [Xuan]: *yi* (义) is read as *yi* (仪). In the *Zhouguan*, the *Sishi* governs ritual *yi* (仪), and Zheng’s note says: the old text writes *yi* (仪) as *yi* (义); Zheng Sinong says: *yi* (义) is read as *yi* (仪). In ancient times, *yi* (仪) was written only as *yi* (义), whereas today *yi* (义) is used for *yi* (谊). In the *Xiaoya*’s *Chuci* ode, *li yi zu du* (礼仪卒度) appears in the *Han shi* as *yi* (义). In the *Zhouguan*, the *Daxingren*’s *da ke zhi yi* (大客之仪) appears in the *Da Dai Liji*’s *Chaoshi* chapter as *yi* (义). In the *Yueji*, *zhi zhi li yi* (制之礼义) appears in the *Hanshu*’s *Liyue zhi* as *yi* (仪). In the *Zhouyu*, *shi min gui yi* (示民轨仪) is cited in the *Dayi* commentary as *yi* (义).) *Yi* (仪) means 'model.' (*Jing* [经], *shi* [式], *yi* [仪], and *du* [度] all refer to standards and models. Those who explain it otherwise err.)

**Collation [1]:** The missing text in *Que wu* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, where *du ren* (度人) appears as *shu min* (庶民).

Jie Yu the Madman said: "This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea to dig a river or making a mite carry a mountain. Does the sage’s governance extend to externals? He simply rectifies himself and then acts, ensuring only that those who are steadfast can fulfill their tasks. Moreover, birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets, and field mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape the peril of fumigation and digging—yet you consider these two creatures lacking in knowledge!"

**Annotation [1]:** To regulate things by oneself is to cause them to lose their true nature.

**Annotation [2]:** Entrusting oneself to the myriad things means accomplishing nothing while remaining effortless; using one’s own body to govern the world means tasks will never be completed and burdens will not be borne.

**Explication:** To impose one’s own standards on things is to cause them to lose their authenticity; deceptive virtue is not the true Way. The vastness of the sea is profound and boundless, difficult to fathom, yet digging it into a river ensures no success. Just as the great Dao is distant and obscure, difficult to comprehend, yet carving it into principles makes achievement elusive. Moreover, insects are tiny, while mountains are towering; to make them bear the load is impossible. To order and regulate with wisdom and govern things with benevolence—attempting small schemes for great ends—follows the same principle.

**Explication of Pronunciation and Meaning:** *She hai zao* (涉海凿) is pronounced *dai luo* (待洛) in the initial tone; the same applies below."

Guo pronounced *cu he* in the falling tone. **Li’s Commentary on "River":** To wade into the sea is to sink into the waves; to carve a river ensures no success. **Pronunciation:** *Yin wen*. Originally also written as , same character. **"Cannot bear"** pronounced *sheng*.

**[3] Explication:** To preserve only what lies within one’s inherent nature and destiny.
**Explication:** To govern according to one’s inherent limits is to never extend governance beyond them. To govern the external is to speak of what cannot be governed.

**[4] Explication:** Each fulfills the measure of its nature and destiny.
**Explication:** Only after following the true nature can transformation proceed.

**[5] Explication:** Not to do what lies beyond one’s capacity.
**Explication:** *Que* means "true." To follow the true nature of things, and for matters within one’s ability, to employ them accordingly—this is to remain within inherent limits and not to extend beyond them.
**Explication of Pronunciation and Meaning:** *Que hu* (確乎) pronounced *ku xue* in the falling tone. **Li’s Commentary:** "Firm in appearance." **Cui’s Version:** Written as 橐, pronounced *tuo*. ◎ **Qing Fan’s Note:** In the *Wen Xuan*, Liu Xiaobiao’s *Disquisition on Destiny* commentary cites Sima’s note: "*Que hu* means unchanging." The *Explication of Pronunciation and Meaning* omits this.

**[6] Explication:** Even birds and beasts each have their means of self-preservation, so when emperors and kings employ them without interference, they achieve completion on their own.
**Explication:** *Zeng* means "net." *Yi* refers to shooting with an arrow tied to a cord. *Xishu* is a small mouse. *Shenqiu* is a sacred mound or altar. Birds fly high to escape nets, while mice burrow deep to avoid fumigation—all follow their nature spontaneously. How could they await instruction to evade harm? If birds and mice act thus, so too do humans. Thus, to model governance on Confucian principles is the height of delusion.

**Explication of Pronunciation and Meaning:** *Zeng* (矰) pronounced *ze neng* in the falling tone. **Li’s Commentary:** "Net." **"Harm"** in Cui’s version written as 菑. *Xi* (鼷) pronounced *xi*. *Xun* (熏) pronounced *xiang yun* in the falling tone.

**[7] Explication:** Do you truly not know that these two creatures each preserve themselves without instruction?
**Explication:** *Er* means "you." Have you never known that these two creatures, without instruction, evade harm and preserve themselves? Since they burrow deep and fly high, how can they lack awareness? How much more so for humans—yet to model governance on Confucian principles, to deceive and manipulate in governing things, is not this delusion?

**[Collation Notes:]**
(1) The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character *kuang* (狂).
(2) The character *wang* (妄) follows the *Shide Tang* edition.
(3) The *Shide Tang* edition has *ru* (如) in place of *zhi* (知).

Tian Gen wandered to the southern slopes of Yin Mountain, arriving at the banks of the Liao River, where he chanced upon the Nameless Man and posed this question: "I beg to ask how to govern the world."

**[1] Explication:**
"Tian Gen" and "Nameless Man" are both surnames and given names, serving as allegorical figures in this dialogue. *Yin yang* refers to the southern slopes of Yin Mountain. The Liao River lies within the borders of the state of Zhao. *Zao* means "to encounter." Tian Gen, roaming by the mountains and rivers, happened upon the Nameless Man and questioned him, his inquiry concerning the governance of the world.

**[Pronunciation and Meaning:]**
*Tian Gen*: Cui’s edition states this is a person’s name.
*You yu Yin yang*: Li notes, "Yin is the name of a mountain. *Yang* means the southern slope." Cui says, "Yin yang is a place name." Sima comments, "Yin means 'multitude,' indicating travel toward the south." Some versions write it as *Yin Tang*.
*Liao shui*: Pronounced *liao*. Li notes, "The name of a river."

**[Collation Note:]**
(1) The character *ben* (本) is omitted following the *Shide Tang* edition and the original text of the *Pronunciation and Meaning* section.

The Nameless Man replied: "Away with you! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such an inopportune question? I am about to become a companion to the Creator, and when I grow weary, I shall ride the boundless bird, soaring beyond the six directions to wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the vast and limitless wilds. Why would you trouble me with the governance of the world, disturbing my heart?"

**[1] Commentary:**
To ask about governing the world is to fail to begin with the Great Origin or end in the Mysterious Darkness.

**[Subcommentary:]**
You are a coarse and vulgar man—you should leave at once. The purport of your question greatly displeases my heart.

**[Pronunciation and Meaning:]**
*Bu yu* (不豫): Sima [Biao] says: "To resent the lack of gradual preparation, as it is too abrupt."
Simplified Emperor [of the Jin] says: "*Yu* (豫) means 'joy.'"
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: "The current text reads *bu yu* (不预)."
◎ Yu Yue says: "*The Erya*, 'Explaining Words': '*Yu* (豫) means 'weary.'' In the *Chu Ci*, 'Lamenting the Upright,' it says, *'Xing xing zhi er bu yu xi'*—Wang Yi’s commentary also states: '*Yu* (豫) means 'weary.'' Thus, the gloss of *yu* as 'weary' is its ancient meaning. The Nameless Man deeply resents Tian Gen’s excessive questioning, hence his words, *'He wen zhi bu yu'*—much like saying, *'Why does Master Xu not weary of trouble?' Simplified Emperor’s gloss of *yu* as 'joy' entirely misses the point."
*Da chu* (大初): Pronounced *tai*.

**[2] Commentary:**
Allow people to act of their own accord.

**[Subcommentary:]**
The Creator’s role in shaping humanity is such that each has their allotted share—why impose laws or take deliberate action to govern them? Since all is in accord with the Great Thoroughfare, one simply allows things to be without aiding them.

**[3] Commentary:**
*Mang miao* merely refers to the myriad fragments. Riding the myriad fragments, one gallops through the ten thousand things, thus able to move in and out with constant freedom, without any constricted or obstructed place.

**[Subcommentary:]**
*Mang miao* means "profound and distant." *Kuang lang* is the name for vastness and breadth. The bird is chosen for its traceless lightness in ascent. *Six extremes* is synonymous with the six directions. The sage who governs the world does so with tranquility and non-action, aligning with the nature of things as if in harmony with creation. Yet when he ceases activity and returns to the root, weary of the world, he then rides the profound and distant Way, soaring through the void to erase all traces, transcending the six directions in unbounded freedom, wandering in the realm of Nothing Whatever with perfect ease. He concentrates his spirit and wisdom on the mountain of She, abiding in purity and emptiness in the open wilds. In this state, how could there be any governance of the world? For he is one who embodies non-action.

The *Cheng fu* is pronounced as *fu*. *Mang* is read as *mo dang* in reverse. Cui’s version writes it as *meng*. *Miao* is read as *miao xiao* in reverse. *Mang miao* describes a state of lightness and emptiness. Cui says: "The bird with a *meng miao* head moves without leaving traces." *Kuang* is pronounced as *ku guang* in Xu’s reverse reading. *Lang* is pronounced as *li dang* in Xu’s reverse reading; Li pronounces it as *lang*. *Kuang lang* signifies the absence of stagnation. Cui says: "It is like vastness and openness." *Wu xia* is read as *hu jia* in reverse.

The annotation states: To let all things roam in the realm of self-attainment is to govern without governing. The commentary says: If one releases and entrusts all to spontaneity, then things transform of themselves. What art of governance could there be that would seek to impose order? Why stir my heart with such concerns?

The *yi* in *he yi* is pronounced as *yi* in Xu’s reading, or as *yu li* in reverse. Sima says: "It means method." One version writes it as *yi*, read as *niu shi* in reverse. Cui’s version writes it as *wei*. Yu Yue says: *Yi* is a character of uncertain identity; comparing the various explanations, it is likely a corruption of *nie*. Hence the reverse reading *yu li*, and Sima’s gloss of "method," which aligns with the meaning of *nie*. However, though the character may be *nie*, its sense is not that of *nie*; it should be read as *yi*. *Yi* originally takes *nie* as its phonetic, and in ancient texts, sound took precedence, so it may appear simply as *nie*. The version that writes it as *yi* corrects the loan character to its proper form. The *Yiqie jing yin yi* cites the *Tong su wen*: "Speech in dreams is called *yi*." The Nameless Man likely refers to Tian Gen’s questions as dream-speech, hence: "Why do you trouble my heart with such *yi* about governing the world?"

Qing Fan notes: The *Yiqie jing yin yi*, in its commentary on the *Sifen lü* (Volume 32), cites the *San cang*: "*Yi* (read as *niu sui* in reverse) means deceitful speech." Deceitful speech is no different from dream-speech. *Er zi zhi* is read as *zhi li* in reverse; the same applies below.

The **Shide Tang edition** writes *yu*.

**He further asked again.**
**[1]** **[Commentary]** Tian Gen had not yet understood, so he sought further clarification of his doubts.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *You fu*: *fu*, read as *fú yòu* in reverse.

The Nameless Man said: “Let your mind wander in the **bland**[1], align your *qi* with the **vacuous**[2], follow things as they are without harboring private designs, and the world will be governed.[3]”
**[1]** **[Commentary]** To entrust oneself to one’s nature without adornment is to be bland.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yu dan*: *dan*, read as *tú zàn* in reverse; Xu, *dà gǎn* in reverse.
**[2]** **[Commentary]** To rest in stillness, quiescent in one’s nature, is to be vacuous.
**[Exegesis]** You may roam your spirit in the realm of tranquility and stillness, unite your form and *qi* in the land of silence and solitude—both form and spirit utterly empty and still. Thus, the world will transform of itself without need for governance.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yu mo*: *mo*, read as *mò*.
**[3]** **[Commentary]** To follow one’s nature is to be public; to seek to augment it with the heart’s desires is to be private. Harboring the private is insufficient to sustain life, while following the public preserves it whole.
**[Exegesis]** Follow the natural dispositions of things as they arise, comply with the inherent nature of spontaneity, and do not impose private schemes or contrived methods to govern. Release and entrust all to spontaneity, and both self and other will be preserved intact.

Yang Ziju saw Lao Dan and said: “Suppose there were a man here, swift as an echo in vigor and strength, penetrating and perspicacious in all matters, diligent in the study of the Dao without weariness. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?[1]”
**[1]** **[Exegesis]** Surnamed Yang, given name Zhu, styled Ziju. He inquired of Laozi about the way of the enlightened king: Suppose there were a man of innate acuity, quick in spirit and intelligence, responsive as an echo, resolute and decisive in affairs, discerning and penetrating in all things, clear and astute, diligent in the study of the Dao without slackening. Could such a man be deemed comparable in virtue to an enlightened king or sage emperor?

Cui (Yun) says: “Nothing is not understood, nothing is not illuminated.” *Bu*: read as *qí juàn* in reverse.

Lao Dan said: “Such a one, in comparison to a sage, is like a petty functionary, easily displaced, bound by skill, wearied in body, and agitated in mind.[1] Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards bring hunters, the agility of gibbons and macaques brings snares, and the prowess of the hound that seizes the raccoon-dog brings tethering. Could such as these be compared to an enlightened king?[2]”
**[1]** **[Commentary]** Such exertions cannot preserve the body; they are not worthy of comparison to a sage-king.
**[Exegesis]** To compare such a man to a sage-king would be no different from a petty functionary laboring and altering his appearance, his skills and crafts wearying his spirit, his body transformed by toil, his mind agitated by entanglements.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Xu*: read as written. Sima (Biao) says: “Coarse, lowly.” Jianwen says: “Mutual.” *Yi*: read as *yì*. Cui, *yǐ chǐ* in reverse, says: “To treat lightly.” Jianwen concurs. *Ji*: Xu, *qí qǐ* in reverse. Jianwen says: “Art, skill.” *Xi*: read as written. Cui writes *xì*, or alternatively *jì*. Jianwen says: “Read as *xì*.” **◎** Lu Wenchang says: “Originally written as *xì*, identical to the character above. Now corrected to *jì*, as seen in the *Han shu*.” **◎** Qing Fan notes: Zheng’s commentary on the *Zhou li* states: *Xu tu* refers to commoners subject to corvée labor. *Yi* is read as in *Mencius*’ *yi qi tian chou* (“to till one’s fields”). *Xu yi* means petty functionaries laboring in service. Zheng’s commentary on the *Tan gong* states: *yi mu* means to tend to the grass and trees; *yi* means to tend. *Ji xi* refers to those who, as stated in the *Wang zhi*, “serve their superiors with a single skill, do not engage in dual occupations, and do not transfer to other offices”—that is, they are bound by their skills. The *Shi wen* states: Sima (Biao) says *xu* means coarse, Jianwen says *xu* means mutual—both are incorrect. *Chu xin*: read as *chì lǜ* in reverse.
**[2]** **[Commentary]** All these are bound by their patterns and skills, ensnaring their bodies—this is not to ride the empty and master the boundless.
**[Exegesis]** *Jie* means rope. *Yuan ju* are macaques. The skins of tigers and leopards bear patterns, hence they are hunted; macaques, swift and agile, are ever bound by ropes; dogs that seize raccoon-dogs are always tethered by the neck. If one likens a man swift as an echo to a sage emperor, then might these three creatures be compared to an enlightened king?

Yang Ziju, startled, said: “May I ask, then, what is the governance of an enlightened king?[1]”
**[1]** **[Exegesis]** Having erred in his question, he was alarmed and changed his countenance, earnestly seeking the meaning of the enlightened king’s governance.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Cu ran*: read as *zǐ liù* in reverse, the appearance of a change in countenance. *Zhi zhi*: read as *zhí lì* in reverse.

Lao Dan said: “The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; his transformation bestows upon the myriad things, yet the people do not rely on him. There is none who can name him, and he allows things to rejoice of themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and roams in the realm of Nothingness.”

**[1]** **[Commentary]** If there were no enlightened king, none in the world could attain self-realization. That they now do so is truly the enlightened king’s achievement. Yet his achievement lies in non-action, returning all to the world. When all in the world attain self-reliance, it seems not the enlightened king’s doing.
**[Exegesis]** The sage’s governance matches the workings of creation, covering all like the dark heavens, bearing all like the vast earth. Yet when his work is complete, he does not claim it, so it seems not his own.

**[2]** **[Commentary]** The enlightened king meets each thing’s nature, so each person says, “I am thus of myself,” and none know they rely on the enlightened king.
**[Exegesis]** He guides and transforms the people, leading them to abandon evil; he bestows upon the myriad things, granting them good fortune. Yet his profound power works unseen, so in daily use they remain unaware. The people say, “I am naturally thus,” not relying on the ruler’s ability.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Dai*: read as *tù dài* in reverse.

**[3]** **[Commentary]** Though his achievements cover the world, he does not claim them as his own name, so all things believe they have attained of themselves and rejoice.
**[Exegesis]** *Mo* means “none.” *Ju* means “to display.” He attributes merit to things, not displaying his name, allowing each to attain and delight in contentment.

**[4]** **[Commentary]** He dwells in the path of transformation, daily renewing without fixed form.

**[5]** **[Commentary]** When he embodies the myriad things, his roaming is in emptiness. If he cannot merge with things, he will be at odds with them without respite—how then could he roam in emptiness?
**[Exegesis]** *Wu you* is the wondrous origin. Establishing virtue and merit, his spirit is unfathomably subtle. Yet he is both trace and origin, so his mind constantly roams in the ultimate.
**[Textual Note]** **(1)** The *Shide Tang* edition writes *ling* as *jin*.

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew men’s life and death, survival and perishing, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death, fixing the time to the year, month, ten-day period, or day, as if a spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in abandonment.

Liezi saw him and was intoxicated in heart. Returning, he told Huzhi, saying: “At first I took the Master’s Dao as the ultimate—yet there is something even more ultimate!”

**[1]** **[Exegesis]** In Zheng there was a diviner of divine and wondrous skill, highly accurate, who came from Qi. His surname was Ji, his given name Xian.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Shen wu yue Ji Xian*: Li says: women are called *wu*, men *xi*. Ji Xian is his name.

**[2]** **[Commentary]** They did not wish to hear their death dates.
**[Exegesis]** His divination of fortune and misfortune was never in error; he fixed the time precisely, as if a spirit. Unwilling to hear of impending misfortune, they abandoned and fled.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Bu*: read as *xǔ jì* in reverse.

**[3]** **[Exegesis]** Liezi’s deeds are recorded in the “Free and Easy Wandering” chapter; they are not explained again here. Huzhi was a man of Zheng who had attained the Dao. His style was Huzhi, his given name Lin—Liezi’s teacher. Liezi, seeing Ji Xian’s minor arts, as accurate as a spirit, admired him in his heart as if intoxicated. Returning, he told his teacher in full.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Xin zui*: Xiang says: bewildered by his arts. *Huzhi*: Sima says: given name Lin, a man of Zheng, Liezi’s teacher.

**[4]** **[Commentary]** He meant Ji Xian’s attainment surpassed the Master’s.
**[Exegesis]** *Fuzhi* refers to Huzhi. *Zhi* means “ultimate.” At first, when he received instruction, he took the Master’s Dao as the ultimate. Now, seeing Ji Xian, he found his Dao even more ultimate. This was Yu Kou’s intoxicated speech.

Huzhi said: “I have taught you only its patterns, not yet its reality—how could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs! You take the Dao and contend with the world, and so you are surely believed. That is why others can divine you. Come with him and let me show myself to him.”

**[1]** **[Exegesis]** *Yu* means “to teach.” *Ji* means “exhaust.” I have taught you, beginning to exhaust its patterns, but as for its wondrous principle, you have not yet reached its reality. You cling to words and believe you have attained the Dao—how do you know the fish-trap and rabbit-snare are not the fish and rabbit?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Ji qi wen*: Li says: *ji* means “exhaust.” *De Dao yu*: read as *yú*.

**[2]** **[Commentary]** This refers to Liezi’s not yet embodying the Dao.
**[Exegesis]** A flock of hens without a rooster cannot lay eggs. With patterns but no reality, what Dao is there?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhong ci er wu xiong er you xi luan yan*: Sima says: you have not yet mastered the teachings, so you have not yet achieved it—like a flock of hens without a rooster, which cannot lay eggs.

**[3]** **[Commentary]** Without embodying the Dao, one has intentions. With intentions, one contends with one aspect of the world, and so is surely believed by it. Thus others can divine you.
**[Exegesis]** You use the Dao of words to contend with the world. Lacking great wisdom, you surely believe that petty diviner. That is why Ji Xian can divine you.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Shi kang*: read as *kù làng* in reverse. *Bi xin*: Cui says: pause here. *Xiang ru*: read as *xī liàng* in reverse.
**[Textual Note]** ◎ Lu Wenchao says: modern editions write *nǚ* as *rǔ*.

**[4]** **[Exegesis]** The perfected person is profound and distant, his spirit wondrous and hard to know. Root and trace are both still and active, beyond the measure of the ordinary. Thus he summoned him to come and showed himself to him.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Shi zhi*: also written as *shi* (to see). Cui says: *shi* (to see) means *shi zhi* (to show).
**[Textual Note]** (1) *Que wu* cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript, which writes *ji* (既) as *wu* (无). (2) The character *rǔ* (汝) follows the *Shide Tang* edition and Lu’s emendation.

The next day, Liezi took him to see Master Hu. Upon leaving, he said to Liezi: “Alas! Your master is dead! He will not live! It will not be ten days! I saw something strange—he resembled damp ashes.”

**[Exegesis]** *Xi* is an exclamation. Zilín showed his still and desolate appearance, and Jixian declared him near death. The omen of strangeness had already appeared; within ten days, the sign of lifelessness would be like damp ashes.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Xi*: Xu pronounces it as *xī*; Guo as *xǔ yì*. *Xun shu*: *suǒ zhǔ* rhyme.

Liezi entered, weeping so that his tears soaked his lapels, and told Master Hu. Master Hu said: “Earlier, I showed him the earthly pattern—sprouting yet neither stirring nor upright. This was nearly to let him see my blocked virtue-mechanism. Try bringing him again.”

**[Commentary]**
"Sprouting yet unmoving, neither stirring nor upright" describes a state akin to withered wood devoid of blossoms or damp ashes devoid of embers—this is the moment when the perfected person remains unperturbed. The perfected person moves like heaven, rests like earth, flows like water, and abides in profound stillness like a deep pool. Profound stillness and flowing water, celestial motion and terrestrial quiescence—though distinct, they are one in their spontaneity, unforced and self-so. Now, when Jixian saw him seated as if a corpse, lost in oblivion, he declared him near death; when he glimpsed his spirit stirring in celestial accord, he deemed him alive. If one could respond without engaging the heart-mind, allowing principle to align with the mysterious tally of its own accord, ascending and descending with transformations while measuring all by the world’s rhythms, then one would suffice as master of things, following the boundless flow of time—thus eluding the diviner’s calculations. This is the great purport of *Responding to Emperors and Kings*.

**[Exegesis]**
*Wen* means "pattern." *Zhen* means "to move." Earth, being without intent, remains tranquil, so its pattern is expressed through stillness. "Sprouting yet desolate, never stirring, without intent yet self-upright"—appearing like something toppled—this is the moment when the great sage remains unperturbed, which the petty shaman mistakes for lifelessness. Yet Master Hu’s demonstration encompassed four levels: first, revealing the wondrous root’s empty quiescence, still and unmoving; second, manifesting responsive traces, dynamic yet undisturbed; third, the root and traces merging, movement and stillness as one; fourth, root and traces both forgotten, movement and stillness both transcended. Here, he displayed the first: the wondrous root’s empty quiescence, still and unmoving.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*Xiang wu*: Xu pronounces it as *xǔ liàng*; alternate form *xiàng*, also written *xiàng*, identical. Cui’s version reads *kāng*, glossed as "previously."
*Di wen*: Same as "earth."
Cui: *Wen* means "principle."
*Bu zhen bu zheng*: All read as written.
Cui’s version reads *bu zhen bu zhi*, glossed as "like moving yet unmoving."
◎ Yu Yue notes: The *Liezi*’s *Huangdi* chapter reads *zuì hū bù zhèn bù zhǐ*, which should be followed. *Zuì* is read as *cuò*. The *Shuowen*’s *shan* section writes it as *cuò*, glossed as "mountain’s appearance"—correct. *Zhen* is a variant of *zhèn*. *Bu zhèn bù zhǐ* means "unmoving and unceasing," hence described as *cuò hū*, "like a mountain." The present text’s *zuì* is mistaken for *méng*, and *zhǐ* is mistaken for *zhèng*, losing the original sense. According to the *Phonetic Gloss*, Cui’s version reads *bu zhèn bù zhǐ*, matching the *Liezi*—this should be used to emend the text.
*Cheng ying*: *Ying* as in "response"; same hereafter.

【Passage Two】
**Annotation:** When the power-mechanism does not activate, it is called "blocked."

**Exegesis:** *Dai* means "approaching." *Du* means "obstructed." *Ji* means "movement." The mechanism of utmost virtue, though open, does not activate, manifesting as serene stillness—like dampened ashes. Petty sorcerers and mediocre practitioners approach this state in their limited perception.

**Phonetic Gloss:** *Du de ji* – Cui’s note: "The mechanism of my virtue is obstructed."

【Passage Three】
**Exegesis:** Earlier, he falsely claimed I was dead; now, summoned again, he is sent to return.

**Collation:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *xiang*.
(2) The *Quewu* cites a Jiangnan ancient manuscript, which correctly writes *zhi*.
(3) The *neng* character is supplied from the *Daozang* edition.
(4) *Zhi* mistakenly written as *zheng*, corrected per *Zhuzi Pingyi*.

The next day, he was again brought before Master Huzi. Upon leaving, he said to Liezi: "Fortunate is your master to have met me! He is recovering, fully alive again! I have seen his *blocked potential*."

**Note One**
**Exegesis:** This corresponds to the second state: traces manifest in response to stimuli, moving yet not quiescent. Displaying the *Ying*-aspect, his spirit and qi subtly stir—far from withered wood, now resembling his former vitality. Yet he misattributes this to my power, claiming credit for the recovery. How fortunate that he is mending!

**Phonetic Gloss:** *You chou* – Pronounced *chǒu liú*.

**Note Two**
**Annotation:** *Quan* means "mechanism." Only now does he realize that what he saw yesterday was the *blocked mechanism*, hence his earlier judgment of impending death.

**Exegesis:** *Quan* means "mechanism." Previously, at first glance, he resembled dampened ashes—his mechanism blocked, utterly devoid of responsive movement. Today, having met me, he has regained full vitality. The petty sorcerer, with his scant discernment, presumptuously claims credit for this.

Liezi entered and reported this to Huzi. Huzi said: "Earlier, I showed him *Heaven-and-Earth*, where names and realities do not intrude, yet the mechanism stirs from the heels. This is nearly perceiving my *excellent mechanism*. Bid him come again."

**Annotation One**
Within Heaven-and-Earth, the power of sheltering and bearing is manifest. Compared to the patterns of earth, is this not like the outer shell of an egg? This is the appearance of responsive movement.

**Exegesis One**
*Rang* means "earth." To show him *Heaven-and-Earth* is to display the appearance of responsive movement. Just as the two primal forces shelter and bear the myriad things, so too does the perfected person’s responsiveness mirror this principle.

**Phonetic Gloss:** *Gong jian* – Pronounced *xián biàn fǎn*.

**Editorial Note:** Lu Ji’s *Yan Lian Zhu* commentary cites Sima’s note: *Rang* means "earth." The *Shiwen* omits this.

**Annotation Two**
When one entrusts oneself to the natural and shelters and bears all, the celestial mechanism responds in profound mystery, and the adornments of fame and profit become discarded things.

**Exegesis Two**
Though he descends to tread the dust and harmonizes his radiance to benefit things, neither name nor reality enters his numinous abode.

**Annotation Three**
It always arises from the utmost root.

**Exegesis Three**
The *zhong* is the root. Though he moves in response to things, he never loses the timely measure, for this divine mechanism issues from the wondrous root—moving yet ever quiescent.

**Annotation Four**
The mechanism arises and excels in him, so he perceives it.

**Exegesis Four**
He reveals the excellent mechanism, responding to these two primal forces. When Ji Xian saw this appearance, he declared it excellent. To be fully alive is to perceive this excellence.

**Textual Note:** The character *wài* follows the Song edition.

The next day, he brought him again to see Huzi. Upon leaving, he said to Liezi: "Your master is not in equilibrium; I can find no basis to divine him. Let him settle, and I will divine him again."

**Exegesis One**
This is the third demonstration, showing the immediate identity of root and trace, where movement and quiescence occur as one. The perfected person’s virtue is full and wisdom complete; with an empty mind and concentrated illumination, root and trace are undivided, movement and stillness indistinguishable. The Dao is profoundly mysterious—how could a petty diviner fathom it? He spoke of settling his mind and traces to attempt another divination. Not daring to definitively predict fortune or misfortune, he merely said he would divine him again.

**Lu’s Reading of the Text**
*Bu qi* (不齐): read as *zè jiē* (侧皆反), also written as *zhāi* (斋). The same below.
*Qie fu* (且复): read as *fú yòu* (扶又反).

Liezi entered and reported this to Huzi. Huzi said: “Just now I showed him the state of *Great Vacuity, Nothing Prevailing*. This is likely how he saw my balanced qi-mechanism. The stillness of the leaping sturgeon makes a deep pool; the stillness of still water makes a deep pool; the stillness of flowing water makes a deep pool. There are nine names for the deep pool—here I have shown him three. Let him come again.”

**Annotation One**
Abiding at the utmost of Great Vacuity, the mind is vast and placid, merging mysteriously with the ten thousand directions. Thus, victory and defeat cannot be placed within it.

**Exegesis One**
*Chong* (冲) means emptiness; *mo* (莫) means nothing. The sage’s illumination is profoundly concentrated, equal in measure to the Great Void. Root and trace are immediately identical, movement and quiescence occur as one—there is no superiority or inferiority, so how could there be victory or defeat?

**Lu’s Reading of the Text**
*Bo xin* (泊心): read as *bái bó* (白博反), also as *pò* (魄).
*De cuò* (得厝): read as *qī gù* (七故反), also written as *cuò* (措), same meaning.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The modern text writes *cuò* (措).

**Annotation Two**
Nothing is not balanced, all is merged into one. Those who peer at heaven through a tube cannot see its limits, so it appears uneven.

**Exegesis Two**
*Heng* (衡) means balance. Trace is immediately root, no superiority or inferiority; the spirit and qi are equal, responding to the mechanism thus. The petty diviner, seeing only what is near, cannot fathom what is distant. His mind is confused, which is why he asked for equilibrium.

**Lu’s Reading of the Text**
*Guǎn kuī* (管窥): read as *qù guī* (去规反).

**Annotation Three**
The deep pool is but a term for stillness and silence. Water is always without intent, yielding to external things. Thus, whether flowing or still, whether the sturgeon circles or the dragon leaps, it remains profoundly self-possessed, never losing its stillness and silence. The perfected person acts when employed, rests when set aside; though action and rest differ, the mystery of silence is one. Therefore, I briefly cite three differences to illustrate this. Though waves surge and the nine transformations unfold, though order and chaos intermingle, those who abide at the utmost remain serene and self-content, placidly forgetting all doing.

**Exegesis Three**
This is an analogy. The *ni* (鲵) is a large fish.

"Huán" means to coil, and "shěn" means to gather. The body of water is without intent, its movement and stillness following external things. Whether the whale or sturgeon coils, the dragon or serpent leaps, whether it congeals in stillness or surges in turbulent flow—though its ripples may be clear and tranquil, and its forms manifold, its profound silence and absence of intent remain one in essence. Thus, the coiling of the sturgeon serves to balance qi, still water mirrors the patterns of earth, and flowing water reflects the expanse of heaven and earth. Though these three differ, their empty illumination is one.

As for the nine names of the deep pool, they are: the coiling of the sturgeon (*ní huán*), still water (*zhǐ shuǐ*), flowing water (*liú shuǐ*), spring water (*gǔ shuǐ*), overflowing water (*làn shuǐ*), soaking water (*wò shuǐ*), dammed water (*yōng shuǐ*), patterned water (*wén shuǐ*), and rich water (*féi shuǐ*). Hence, they are called the nine. All derive from the *Liezi*, where the text records them in full; here, only these three are briefly mentioned.

**Annotation**
*《Ní》* (鲵): read as *wǔ xī* (五兮反).
*《Huán》* (桓): Sima Biao says: *ní huán* are two kinds of fish. Jianwen says: *ní* is the whale, *huán* means to coil. Cui’s edition reads *ní jù*, stating: the place where fish dwell. It also notes: *jù* may be written as *huán*.
*《Zhī shěn》* (之审): Guo reads as written. Jianwen says: to dwell. Sima Biao says: *shěn* should be *pán* (蟠), meaning to gather. Cui’s edition reads *pān* (潘), stating: the domain where swirling currents converge.
◎ Yu Yue says: Sima Biao reads *shěn* as *pán* (蟠), meaning to gather; Cui’s edition reads *pān* (潘), stating it is the domain where swirling currents converge. Judging by the meaning of the character, it should actually be *fān* (□). The *Shuowen*’s water section states: *fān* (□) is a great wave, from water and *fān* (旛) as phonetic. The character *pān* (潘) is an abbreviated form. Sima Biao’s reading of *pán* (蟠) is mistaken. Guo’s edition as *shěn* (审) loses the original character. Further, the *Liezi*’s "Yellow Emperor" chapter states: "The coiling of the sturgeon’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the still water’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the flowing water’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the overflowing water’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the soaking water’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the spring water’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the dammed water’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the patterned water’s *pān* forms a deep pool, the rich water’s *pān* forms a deep pool—these are the nine deep pools." Though the nine deep pools are fully listed, they do not logically connect with the preceding and following text, suggesting they may be misplaced passages from elsewhere. Even the *Zhuangzi* as we know it already contained this issue. Though we dare not remove them outright, they are not essential to the meaning of this passage, so only three are cited here.
◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Annotation* cites Cui’s edition, where *shěn* is written as *pān* (潘), stating it is the domain where swirling currents converge. The *Liezi*’s "Yellow Emperor" chapter reads: "The coiling of the sturgeon’s *pān* forms a deep pool." The character should be *pān* (潘). The *Shuowen* states: "A deep pool (*yuān*) is swirling water." The *Guanzi*’s "Measuring the Earth" chapter says: "Water that emerges from the earth but does not flow is called a deep pool." This refers to water swirling and pooling to form a deep pool—some harbor creatures within, some stop and do not flow, some flow and collect in stillness to form a deep pool. The accumulation of water, whether flowing or still, follows its natural tendency to form deep pools. Thus, it is said: "The great thoroughfare bears no trace." Its spreading and overflowing are not the work of human effort.
*《Nine Names of the Deep Pool》*: The *Huainanzi* states there are nine swirling deep pools. Xu Shen’s commentary says: "Utterly profound."
*《Zhì luàn》* (治乱): read as *zhí lì* (直吏反).

**Exegesis Four**
To reveal the utmost mystery, further exemplification is required.

**Collation Notes**
(1) The *Shide Tang* edition reads *cuò* (措).
(2) The character *gǔ* (氿) follows the *Liezi*.
(3) The character follows the *Liezi*.

The next day, he again met with Huzi. Before he could steady himself, he lost composure and fled. Huzi said: "Pursue him!"

**Exegesis One**
Jixian’s previous and subsequent divinations were based on superficial observations, lacking profound insight; thus, he retained a limited perspective.

Now, in this fourth encounter, the Dao was utterly profound—both root and trace forgotten, movement and stillness both transcended. The sagely mind moves through emptiness, unfathomable to the ordinary, so that before he could steady himself, he fled in disarray.

**Exegesis on "Lost Composure and Fled"**
*Shī ér zǒu* (失而走) is read as written; Xu alternatively pronounces *zǒu* as *yì* (逸).

**Exegesis Two**
Seeing him flee, Huzi commanded, "Seize him!" Liezi pursued but could not overtake him. Returning, he reported to Huzi: "He has vanished! He is lost! I could not reach him!"

**Exegesis One**
Overwhelmed by terror, he fled with such speed that he vanished entirely—lost without a trace.

**Exegesis on "Vanished"**
Cui comments: *miè* (灭) means "to disappear from sight."

Huzi said: "Earlier, I showed him what had never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and followed his flow, so that he knew not who or what I was. Thus, he took me for a withered reed, for a drifting current—hence his flight."

**Annotation One**
Though its transformations are boundless, it remains deeply rooted in the profound mystery.

**Exegesis**
The wondrous origin, the obscure source, lies beyond the four propositions and apart from the hundred negations. It cannot be grasped by thought or captured by form and name. Having severed all words and images, without a fixed path or destination, it is unfathomable—thus he lost himself and fled.

**Annotation Two**
Without intent, one follows the transformations of things.

**Exegesis on "Commission"**
*Wěi* (委) is read as *yú wēi* (于危反). *Shé* (蛇) is read as *yǐ zhī* (以支反). *Wěishé* (委蛇) describes the appearance of perfect compliance.

**Annotation Three**
Floating freely, unattached to anything.

**Exegesis**
*Wěishé* signifies compliance and following. The perfected one responds to things with emptiness, forgetting self and intent, adapting to circumstances without clinging to any source. Being beyond all designation, he cannot be known as any particular "who."

**Annotation Four**
Transforming like withered reeds, flowing with the world’s currents—everywhere following without resistance. Though the perfected one is one, he moves with the changes of the age. Thus, the diviner could find no foothold for his gaze and fled in self-loss. This illustrates that one who would respond as emperor to the world acts without fixed method.

**Exegesis**
*Tuí* (颓) means to let go; *mǐ* (靡) means to follow. The highest virtue, without intent, responds only when moved. Letting go without attachment, following things as they are, it stirs the waves of the dusty world, drifting with the currents of the age, adapting to each moment without clinging. With a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, it remains beyond the diviner’s ken—hence Jixian’s rightful flight.

**Exegesis on "Withered"**
Xu pronounces *dì* (弟) as *tuí* (颓), *zhàng huí* (丈回反). *Mǐ* (靡), *dìmǐ* (弟靡), describes boundlessness. Cui comments: "It is like yielding and submitting."
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The *Zhengzitong* writes *dì* (弟) as *dì* (弟), though later lexicons followed this without ancient precedent. The *Leipian* lists *dì* (弟) with an alternate pronunciation *tú huí* (徒回反), glossing *dìmǐ* (弟靡) as "boundless in appearance." This follows the original. The *Liezi Huangdi* chapter writes it as *máomǐ* (茅靡).
*Bōliú* (波流) is read as written. Cui’s edition has *bōsuí* (波随), glossing it as "always following."
◎ Wang Niansun notes: Guo Xiang says, "Transforming like withered reeds, flowing with the world’s currents—everywhere following without resistance." The *Exegesis* records *bōliú* (波流) as *bōsuí* (波随) in Cui’s edition, glossing it as "always following." The latter is correct. *Shé* (蛇) and *mǐ* (靡) rhyme with *suí* (随). *Shé* (蛇) is pronounced *tú hé* (徒禾反). (The *wěi* (委) in *wěishé* (委蛇) is pronounced *yú hé* (于禾反). *Wěishé* (委蛇) is a reduplicative compound. In the *Shaonan Gaoyang* ode, *wěishé wěishé* (委蛇委蛇) rhymes with *pí tuó* (皮紽). *Pí* (皮) is pronounced *pó* (婆). In the *Zhuangzi Gengsangchu* chapter, *yǔ wù wěishé* (与物委蛇) rhymes with *wéi bō* (为波). *Wéi* (为) is pronounced *é* (讹). *Wěishé* (委蛇) is also written as *wěituó* (委佗). In the *Yong Feng Junzi Xie Lao* ode, *wěiwěi tuótuó* (委委佗佗) rhymes with *jiā hé yí hé* (珈河宜何). *Yí* (宜) is pronounced *é* (俄).) *Mǐ* (靡) is pronounced *mó* (摩). (In the *Zhongfu* hexagram’s second line, *wú yǔ ěr mǐ zhī* (吾与尔靡之) rhymes with *hé* (和). In the *Zhuangzi Zhi Beiyou* chapter, *ān yǔ zhī xiāng mǐ* (安与之相靡) rhymes with *huà duō* (化多). In the *Zuozhuan* under Duke Cheng’s second year, *shī zhì yú mǐ zhī xià* (师至于靡之下), *mǐ* (靡) is pronounced *mó* (摩). In the *Shiji Su Qin zhuan*, *qī nián yǐ chū chuǎimó* (期年以出揣摩), the Zou edition writes it as *chuǎimó* (揣摩).) *Suí* (随) is also pronounced *tú hé* (徒禾反). (The *Bōsuí* (波随) rhymes with □. The *Book of Songs* preface reads *nán xíng ér nǚ bù suí* (男行而女不随); the *Laozi* reads *qián hòu xiāng suí* (前后相随); the *Guanzi Baixin* chapter reads *tiān bù shǐ bù suí* (天不始不随); the *Lüshi Chunqiu Shenyin* chapter reads *rén xiān wǒ suí* (人先我随); the *Hanfeizi Jie Lao* chapter reads *dà jiān zuò zé xiǎo dào suí* (大奸作则小盗随); the *Huainanzi Tai Zu* chapter reads *shàng dòng ér xià suí* (上动而下随); the *Shiji Taishigong Zixu* reads *zhǔ xiān ér chén suí* (主先而臣随)—all rhyming with *hé* (和). The *Lüshi Chunqiu Renshu* chapter reads *wú xiān yǒu suí* (无先有随), rhyming with *hé duō* (和多). The *Jiazi Daoshu* chapter reads *yǒu duān suí zhī* (有端随之), rhyming with *hé yí* (和宜). The *Huainanzi Yuandao* chapter reads *huò nǎi xiāng suí* (祸乃相随), rhyming with *duō* (多). The *Shuowen* reads: *suí* (随) is written with the radical *chuò* (辵) and the phonetic *suí* (隋), pronounced *tuǒ guǒ* (佗果反). The *Shiji Tian Guan Shu* reads: *qián liè zhí dòu kǒu, sān xīng suí běi duān duì*, and the *Suoyin* notes: *suí* (随) is pronounced *tā guǒ* (他果反).)

Thereafter, Liezi returned home, believing he had never yet begun to learn. For three years, he did not venture out. He cooked for his wife, feeding pigs as he would feed people. He took no personal interest in affairs, carving and polishing only to return to simplicity. Alone, he stood like an unhewn clod. Though the world was tangled and sealed, he remained thus to the end.

**Exegesis One**
After Jixian’s flight, Liezi finally awakened to his own delusion, realizing at last the depth of Huqiu’s Dao and the shallowness of the spirit-diviner’s art.

Having recognized his own lack of learning, he begged to withdraw and return home, where he practiced and revered non-action, devoting himself to the profound enterprise.

**Note Two**
This means forgetting distinctions of noble and base.

**Exegesis**
For three years, he did not venture out, secluding himself from worldly affairs. He cooked for his wife, forgetting honor and disgrace. He fed pigs as he would feed people, regarding purity and filth as equal.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*For his* (為其): *yú wěi* (于伪反).
*Cooking for his wife* (妻爨): *qī pàn* (七判反).
*Feeding pigs* (食豕): *sì* (音嗣). The same below.

**Note Three**
This means responding only to what one encounters.

**Exegesis**
Having awakened to the ultimate principle, he regarded self and other as one. Engaging with worldly affairs, he made no distinction between near and far.

**Note Four**
This means abandoning ornamentation to embrace reality.

**Exegesis**
He discarded all tasks of carving and polishing, setting aside embellishment to return to the Way of simplicity and unadorned truth.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Carving and polishing* (雕琢): *zhú jiǎo* (竹角反).
*Abandoning ornamentation* (去華): *qiāng lǚ* (羌吕反).

**Note Five**
This means removing external adornment.

**Exegesis**
*Kuàirán* describes a state devoid of emotion. Externally, he shed all ornamentation; internally, he relinquished cunning and intellect. His form stood like withered wood, solitary and unpaired.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Kuàirán* (块然): Xu reads *kǔ guài* (徐苦怪反), also *kǔ duì* (苦对反).

**Note Six**
Though active, his true nature remained undispersed.

**Exegesis**
*Fēng* means to guard. Though he engaged with the world’s entanglements, harmonizing with others, he preserved his true essence, steadfast and unshaken.

**Phonetic Gloss**
*Entangled* (纷而): *fāng yún* (芳云反). Cui says: a state of chaos.
*Fēngzāi* (封哉): Cui’s version reads *róng* (戎), explaining *fēng róng* as scattered and disordered.
◎ Li Zhen notes: *Fēn ér fēng zāi* in the *Liezi Huangdi* chapter appears as □*rán ér fēng róng*. *Fēng róng* is correct. These six lines form rhyming verse: the two lines about feeding pigs rhyme with *rén* (人) and *qīn* (亲); the two about carving and polishing rhyme with *pǔ* (朴) and *lì* (立); the two about entanglement rhyme with *róng* (戎) and *zhōng* (终). The character *zāi* (哉) is a scribal error. The following four lines also rhyme. Only Cui’s version is uncorrupted, matching the *Liezi*. The *Shangshu*’s *gōng wú kùn zāi* (公无困哉) is cited twice in the *Hanshu* as *gōng wú kùn wǒ* (公无困我). Here, *wǒ* (我) is mistaken for *zāi* (哉), providing further evidence.

【7】【Annotation】Allowing things to fulfill their own ends.
【Exegesis】Movement does not depart from stillness—though scattered and disordered, it remains so.
Response does not stray from the real—ever embracing the One from beginning to end.

【Collation】(1) The lacuna cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, which includes *rán* (然) beneath *fēn* (纷). Another version reads *fēn ér fēng róng* (纷而封戎).

Be not the master of names,
Be not the repository of schemes;
Be not the bearer of affairs,
Be not the lord of knowledge.
Embody the boundless,
And wander without trace;
Exhaust what is received from Heaven,
Yet perceive no gain—
This is emptiness alone.

The mind of the perfected person acts as a mirror:
Neither sending forth nor welcoming,
Responding yet not storing,
Thus able to overcome things without harm.

【1】【Annotation】Following things, each finds its proper name.
【Exegesis】The body is already forgotten—where then would names reside? Thus one no longer serves as master of reputation.

【2】【Annotation】Allowing things to devise their own schemes.
【Exegesis】Empty and serene, without intent, one forgets and entrusts all to things, no longer harboring schemes in the mind’s repository.

【3】【Annotation】Entrusting things to fulfill their own tasks.
【Exegesis】Each follows its natural allotment, letting things act freely, no longer burdening oneself with affairs.

【4】【Annotation】Without intent, things each govern their own knowledge.
【Exegesis】Forgetting the mind and severing thought, one fully accords with all beings, never employing knowledge to lord over things.
【Philological Notes】*Zhǔ* (主) in *zhī zhǔ* (知主) is glossed as *zhì* (智).

【5】【Annotation】Following the self-so of the world, one roams amidst the ten thousand things without limit.
【Exegesis】Embodying the true source, one merges with the realm of wisdom—thus all is boundless.

【6】【Annotation】Entrusting things, one leaves no trace.
【Exegesis】*Dhèn* (朕) means trace.
Though roaming the world and aiding all beings, one conceals one’s tracks and veils one’s light—thus leaving no trace.
【Philological Notes】*Wú dhèn* (无朕) is read *zhí rěn* (直忍反). Cui glosses it as "sign."

【7】【Annotation】Sufficiency brings cessation.
【Exegesis】What is endowed by Heaven varies for each thing—each exhausts its capacity, never finding it insufficient.

【8】【Annotation】Perceiving gain precludes knowing when to stop.
【Exegesis】What the eye sees, though seen, is not truly seen;
What is gained within one’s allotment, though gained, is not truly gained.
Since no intent is formed toward seeing or gaining, though one sees and gains, there is no perception of gain.

【9】【Annotation】Without emptiness, one cannot bear the fullness of things.
【Exegesis】The reason one exhausts one’s allotment yet perceives no gain is simply through emptying the mind and forgetting all.

【10】【Annotation】Reflecting things without emotion.
【Exegesis】A mirror hung in the hall reflects whatever comes before it—so too does the perfected person respond with emptiness.

【11】【Annotation】Coming, it responds; going, it ceases.
【Exegesis】*Jiāng* (将) means to send off.
Things come and go, yet the mirror neither welcomes nor sends them away—what arrives is reflected, never concealed.
So too does the sage’s wisdom, empty and still, illuminate all without obscurity. Things stir, and it responds, yet not with the mind. Without sending or welcoming, how could there be concealment?
【Philological Notes】*Yìng ér bù cáng* (应而不藏) is read as written. An alternate version writes *cáng* (臧), also read as written.

【12】【Annotation】Things come and are reflected; reflection is not of the mind—thus, though the world is vast, there is no burden on the spirit.
【Exegesis】Things arise and perish, yet the mirror neither conceals nor reveals—thus it ever reflects things without being harmed by them.
So too does the sage’s power harmonize with the two poles, its brightness equaling the three luminaries, its illumination vast and impartial. The mind is not wearied, thus nothing is harmed. Overcoming things, it remains unscathed.
【Collation】(1) The *Shì Détáng* edition reads *nì* (逆). (2) *Zhì* (智) follows the original edition cited in the *Philological Notes* and the *Shì Détáng* edition. (3) The *Shì Détáng* edition reads *nǎi* (乃) as *jí* (即). (4) The Zhao Jiànyì edition reads *lái zhào* (来照).

The Lord of the Southern Sea was named Sudden,
The Lord of the Northern Sea was named Fleeting,
The Lord of the Central Realm was named Chaos.
Sudden and Fleeting often met in the land of Chaos, who treated them exceedingly well.
Sudden and Fleeting conspired to repay Chaos’s virtue, saying: “All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one lacks them. Let us try to bore them.”
Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Chaos died.

【1】【Exegesis】The Southern Sea is the realm of brightness, hence Sudden represents being.
The North is the domain of darkness, hence Fleeting represents non-being.
The Center is neither North nor South, hence Chaos represents neither non-being nor being.
【Philological Notes】*Shū* (倏) is read *shū* (叔). Li glosses it as "metaphor for form."
*Hū* (忽) is glossed by Li as "metaphor for formlessness."
*Hùn* (浑) is read *hú běn* (胡本反). *Dùn* (沌) is read *tú běn* (徒本反). Cui glosses *húndùn* (浑沌) as "without apertures." Li glosses it as "undivided clarity and turbidity," a metaphor for the natural. Jianwen explains: *shū* and *hū* take their names from swiftness, *húndùn* from harmony—swiftness metaphorizes action, harmony metaphorizes non-action.

【2】【Exegesis】The two minds of being and non-being meet in the realm of neither non-being nor being, harmonizing the two extremes into a single central intent—hence it is said that Chaos treated them exceedingly well.

【3】【Exegesis】The two, Shu and Hu, still harbored partial attachments, unable to achieve harmony. They yet arose with the mind of learning, falsely嫌ing Chaos’s lack of mind and deeming carving and boring beneficial.

【4】【Commentary】To act is to ruin it.
【Exegesis】To move the four limbs in attachment to boundaries, to bore the seven apertures in defilement by dust—this betrays the perfect purity of Chaos and follows the grasping of being and non-being. Thus one does not complete the full span of Heaven’s years but perishes midway. O learners, take heed and strive! Hence Guo’s commentary states: “To act is to ruin it.”
【Philological Notes】*Qī qiào* (七窍): read *kǔ jiào* (苦叫反). The *Shuowen* glosses it as “apertures.”
*Qī rì ér húndùn sǐ* (七日而浑沌死): Cui explains: “This means not following the natural but forcibly opening the ears and eyes.”

**Chapter 8: Webbed Toes (External Chapters, Book 4, Part 1)**

【1】
【Philological Notes】The chapter takes its name from its subject matter.
Webbed toes and extra fingers emerge from nature—yet exceed virtue.
Hanging wens and dangling wens emerge from form—yet exceed nature.
Those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness and apply them array them in the five viscera—yet they are not the proper alignment of the Dao and virtue.

Thus, webbing in the feet is the conjoining of useless flesh;
branching in the hands is the sprouting of useless fingers.
Those who multiply methods and web the passions of the five viscera indulge in deviant practices of benevolence and righteousness,
and multiply methods in the use of intelligence.

【1】【Exegesis】*Pián* (骈) means “to join”; *mǔ* (拇) is the big toe.

「This refers to the big toe of the foot joining with the second toe, merging into a single toe. *Zhi zhi* (branching fingers) refers to an extra finger growing beside the thumb of the hand, forming six fingers.

That which emerges from nature means these two conditions—webbed toes and branching fingers—both arise from natural endowment, present from the moment of life’s allotment. *Chi* (侈) means “excess.” *De* (德) refers to the five virtues: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. This speaks of Zengzi and Shishu, who by nature possess the five virtues, storing them in the five viscera—yet these are not surplus to their nature.

【*Shiwen*】
*《骈》* read as *bùtián*; *Guangya* states: “to join.” Li [Yi] says: “to join.”
*《拇》* pronounced *mǔ*, the big toe of the foot. Sima [Biao] says: “*Pián mǔ* refers to the big toe joining the second toe.” Cui [Zhuan] says: “all toes joining the big toe.”
*《枝指》* read as written. *San Cang* states: “*zhi zhi* means a hand with six fingers.” Cui [Zhuan] says: “pronounced *qí*, meaning a finger with a branch.”
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: *Qí* should be written as *qí* (岐); later scholars forcibly distinguished them.
*《而侈》* read as *chāngshì*; Xu [Shen] reads *chǔchǐ*. Guo [Xiang] says: “a look of excess.” Sima [Biao] says: “to overflow.” Cui [Zhuan] says: “to exceed.”
*《于德》* Cui [Zhuan] says: “*de* here means ‘capacity.’”

【2】【Commentary】
For the long, there is no surplus; for the short, no deficiency. Thus, webbed toes and dangling wens all emerge from form and nature, not from external things. Yet whether webbed or not, each nature is self-sufficient; only these alone are webbed or branched, appearing excessive compared to others—hence called *chi* (excess). Some deluded ones claim these are not of nature and seek to cut and discard them. This would mean the Dao has no place to abide, virtue no place to bear, humans discard talent, and things discard utility—how could this be the intent of perfect governance?

Things have small and large, abilities have few and many; what is large is webbed, what is many is a wen. The distinction between webbed and wen exists in all things. If none are employed, this is to discard the nature of the myriad things entirely.

【Exegesis】
The attached wen of flesh and the dangling small wen both arise only after form is endowed—thus they emerge from form and are excessive to nature. This is like Li Kuang, whose nature was keen and bright, arrayed in the viscera and palaces, not acquired through learning—hence not excessive to nature.

【*Shiwen*】
*《附赘》* read as *zhāngruì*; *Guangya* states: “a wen.” *Shiming* says: “a piece of flesh growing horizontally, attached to the body.” Another says: “a tumor.”
*《县》* pronounced *xuán*.
*《疣》* pronounced *yóu*.
*《而侈于性》* Sima [Biao] says: “Nature is the original substance of humans.” Webbed toes, branching fingers, attached wens, and dangling wens—these four each emerge from form and nature, yet are not the proper alignment of form and nature, appearing excessive compared to others. Excessive to form, they are surplus to nature; thus in the hand they are useless flesh, in the foot they are unapplied fingers.
Wang [Bi] says: “Nature is the substance of received life; virtue is the root of preserving life. Webbed and branched toes and fingers arise with birth and cannot be excessive to virtue; wens and tumors arise after form is complete and cannot be excessive to nature. These four are likened to talent, intelligence, virtue, and conduct.”
◎ Yu Yue notes: *Xing* (性) means “to be born.” Webbed toes and branching fingers are so from birth—hence said to emerge from nature. Attached wens and dangling tumors arise only after form is complete—hence said to emerge from form. *De* (德) is that by which things are born. The *Tian Di* chapter says, “That by which things obtain life is called *de* (virtue)”—this is the meaning. Webbed toes and branching fingers emerge from nature, yet in terms of virtue they are excessive; attached wens and dangling tumors emerge from form, yet in terms of nature they are excessive. Cui [Zhuan] says: “*De* means ‘capacity’”; Sima [Biao] says: “Nature is the original substance of humans.” To conflate nature, virtue, and form is to entirely miss the point.
◎ Jia Shifu notes: *Shiwen* cites Wang [Bi]: “Nature is the substance of received life; virtue is the root of preserving life.” Webbed toes and branching fingers arise together with birth—hence said to emerge from nature; attached wens and dangling tumors arise after form is complete—hence said to emerge from form.
*《夫》* pronounced *fú*, marking the beginning of a sentence.
*《至治》* read as *zhìlì*.
*《之分》* read as *fēnwèn*; the rest may be inferred by context.
*《物皆有之》* *Zhi* (之) may also be written as *ding* (定).

【3】【Commentary】
Those who merge with things have no excess. Thus, those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness, though arrayed in the five viscera, remain only the proper alignment of a single school—unable to merge with things without distinction and align each with its nature and life. Hence it is said they are not the proper alignment of the Dao and virtue.

The few and many of methods have no fixed limit in the world. Yet the difference between few and many has its own definite measure; even at the scale of a hair’s breadth, they cannot be made to reach one another. Thus, each abiding in its method, the few and many find their own fulfillment. Some deluded ones, hearing that the many cannot rectify the few, seek to discard the many and employ the few—this is to discard the entire world. Is this not absurd?

【Exegesis】
*Fang* (方) means “methods.” This speaks of the virtue of Zengzi and Shishu, whose nature abounds in benevolence and righteousness, arrayed in the viscera and applied—yet this is merely the knowledge of a single school, unable to merge with the myriad things. Heaven merges with things, thus it responds to benevolence and righteousness without being benevolent or righteous, responds to the many and few without being many or few, endlessly transforming with things, without partiality—hence this is the proper alignment of the Dao and virtue.

【*Shiwen*】
*《五藏》* read as *cáng*, as in subsequent instances. The *Huangdi Suwen* states: “Liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are the five viscera.”

【4】【Commentary】
It is simply that nature and life cannot be otherwise—it is not that they are so because they are useful.」

【Exegesis】
The conjoined big toe, though fused, offers no aid in walking—thus, though this flesh is joined, it ultimately becomes useless flesh. The extra finger sprouting from the hand, though it grows, does not enhance grasping—thus, though this flesh is formed, it remains a useless digit. This illustrates that what is received from the natural celestial nature exists of itself, not arising from any auxiliary function.

【5】【Commentary】
The dispositions of the five viscera are simply multifarious by nature; yet those deficient in them forcibly emulate and esteem them, leading to excess and perversion, thereby losing the perfect equilibrium within the body.

【Exegesis】
The followers of Zengzi and Shishu, whose natures abound in benevolence and righteousness, array these dispositions within the viscera. Those of meager nature, feigning admiration, strive to enact them, seeking heavenly principle—yet lacking natural spontaneity, they fall into excess and perversion. *Yin* denotes indulgent stagnation; *pi* denotes the appearance of impropriety.

【*Shiwen*】
*《淫僻》* The base text also writes *pi* as *辟*, pronounced *pǐyì* (徐: *fūchì*). The pronunciation is consistent in the commentary and at the end of the chapter. *《于仁义之行》* read as *yú rén yì zhī xíng* (下孟反).

Cui observes: Branched limbs and superfluous growths, though not the proper form of nature, still emerge from physical constitution and cannot be excised. The dispositions of the Five Viscera, though not the proper alignment of Dao and virtue, are likewise arrayed within one’s nature and cannot be governed. Now to impose the teachings of benevolence and righteousness to regulate the dispositions of the Five Viscera is like severing branched limbs and superfluous growths—it injures the principle of natural spontaneity and only exacerbates the malady.

*《横复》* pronounced *fúyòu* (扶又反). (The *Xu* edition writes *除* at the end of the chapter; the annotation is consistent.)
*《至当》* pronounced *dīnglàng* (丁浪反). Hereafter follows this pattern.

【VI】
【Annotation】
The functions of acuity and discernment each possess their proper measure; thus, multifariousness does not constitute excess, nor does paucity constitute deficiency. Yet the sway of emotions and desires invariably devalues the meager and esteems the abundant. Seeing what is estimable, one feigns admiration and exalts it, thereby exceeding one’s inherent capacity and encumbering one’s natural nature. If, however, one forgets what is esteemed and preserves one’s original measure, then one remains unburdened by nature’s abundance and retains the fullness of all dispositions.

【Exegesis】
To say that those of untrammeled original measure, sufficient in acuity and discernment, are imitated by the meager-natured who feign admiration—is this not a grave error?

【Collation】
(1) The missing character in *Quewu* is cited from Zhang Junfang’s edition as *方* written as □.
(2) Three characters supplied in accordance with *Shiwen*.
(3) The *Shidetang* edition writes *性* as *于*.

Thus, those whose vision is paired and excessive disorder the five colors, indulging in ornate patterns—are not the dazzling brilliance of azure, yellow, *fu*, and *fu* such an instance? This is none other than Li Zhu.

Those whose hearing is excessive disorder the five tones, indulging in the six pitch-pipes—are not the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo, of *Huangzhong* and *Dalü*, such an instance? This is none other than Shi Kuang.

Those whose conduct branches into benevolence uproot virtue to obstruct their nature, seeking fame and reputation, causing the world to clamor in praise of unattainable standards—is this not the case? These are none other than Zengzi and Shishi.

Those whose eloquence is paired and excessive pile up tiles and knot cords to craft sentences, roaming their minds amid the debates of "hard and white" and "same and different," exhausting themselves in vain praise of useless words—is this not the case? These are none other than Yangzi and Mozi.

Thus, all these are paths of excessive pairing and branching—none are the ultimate correctness of the world.

【II】【Commentary】Now, those possessed of ears and eyes never willingly afflict themselves by yearning for deafness or blindness; their affliction invariably lies in their longing for Li Zhu and Shi Kuang. Yet even if Li Zhu and Shi Kuang were inherently keen of sense, they would still be the very agents that disorder the mastery of ears and eyes.

【Exegesis】The five notes are *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*. The six pitch-pipes are *Huangzhong*, *Dalü*, *Guxi*, *Ruibin*, *Wuyi*, and *Jiazhong*—these six being yang. The six complementary pipes are yin, making twelve in all. Metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, leather, and wood—these are the eight timbres. Is it not so? To cling thus to these sounds—is this not the case of Shi Kuang? Shi Kuang, styled Ziye, was the music master of Duke Ping of Jin, preeminent in the knowledge of pitch and rhythm. Now, Li Zhu and Shi Kuang were endowed by nature with keen perception, yet the benighted multitude recklessly admires them, losing their original nature—how could they not be afflicted? Thus, even the keen perception of Li Zhu and Shi Kuang becomes the very agent that disorders the mastery of ears and eyes.

【Philological Notes】*Five notes*: also written as *five sounds*. *Shi Kuang*: Sima Biao states: a worthy minister of Jin, skilled in pitch and rhythm, able to summon spirits. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: a native of Nanhe in Jizhou, born blind.

【III】【Commentary】Now, the natures of Zengzi and Shishi were inherently inclined toward benevolence, yet those whose natures were not so inclined forcibly imitated them. In imitating them, their benevolence became counterfeit. The world never yearned for Jie or Zhi but invariably yearned for Zengzi and Shishi—thus, the flutes and drums of Zengzi and Shishi deluded the world, causing it to lose its true nature far more than Jie or Zhi ever did.

【Exegesis】Those whose conduct *branches into benevolence* are those whose inborn dispositions are replete with benevolence and righteousness, as if an extra finger had sprouted from their natural endowment. In wielding the five virtues, they become partial and mired in perverse excess, thereby obstructing their true nature. In their dealings with others, they amass fame and reputation, causing the common people to gallop in restless competition, just as the pipes and drums of a flute can stir and move things to admiration. Now, Zengzi and Shishi were inherently inclined toward benevolence and righteousness, yet those not so inclined forcibly imitated them, abandoning their shortcomings to emulate their strengths—hence the saying: they upheld an unattainable standard. *Zhuo* means "to pluck"; it refers to plucking false virtues and obstructing one’s true nature. *Zeng* refers to Zeng Shen, styled Ziyu, a disciple of Confucius. *Shi* refers to Shi Qiu, styled Ziyu, a minister of Duke Ling of Wei. These two men were both endowed by nature with benevolence and filial piety, hence their mention here.

【Philological Notes】*Zhuo virtue*: pronounced *zhuo*. Sima Biao states: to pluck. ◎Wang Niansun notes: *Se* (obstruct) and *zhuo* (pluck) are not of the same semantic category. *Se* should be *qian* (to pluck). *Zhuo* and *qian* both mean "to pluck or take." The *Erya* states: *qian* means "to take" (the *Chu Ci Li Sao* commentary and the *Shiji Su Sun Tong Zhuan* *Suoyin*, citing Xu Shen, both concur with the *Erya*). The *Fangyan* writes it as *qian*, glossing it as "to take; in southern Chu, *qian*." The *Shuowen* writes it as □, glossing it as "to pluck or take." (Fan Guang’s commentary on the *Erya* and Li Qi’s commentary on the *Hanshu* "Biographies of Ji Bu, Luan Bu, and Tian Shu" both concur with the *Erya*.) This passage speaks of the world’s people all plucking their virtues and taking their natures, striving for benevolence and righteousness to amass fame—not that they obstruct their natures. The *Chu Zhen* chapter of the *Huainanzi* states: "The learning of the vulgar world plucks virtue and takes nature, inwardly vexing the five viscera and outwardly exhausting the ears and eyes. Only then do they begin to summon gnats and shake the finest threads of things, swaying and brandishing benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, displaying their conduct and surpassing their wisdom before the world to clamor for fame and reputation." It also states: "Now, when the myriad things come, they pluck and take our nature, seize and extract our essence." Both are evidence of this.

Here the character for "hand" in clerical script is sometimes written as □ (as when *ju* 舉 is written with the "hand" radical or *feng* 奉 is written similarly). Thus, *qian* 搴 may also be written as □, its form resembling *sai* 塞, leading to the error of substituting one for the other.

The *Huanggu* 簧鼓 refers to the reed pipes of the *sheng* 笙; *gu* 鼓 means "to move." The *Zeng Shi* 曾史 refers to Zeng Shen 曾参 and Shi Qiu 史鰌: Zeng Shen practiced benevolence, while Shi Qiu practiced righteousness.

*Zhi* 跖 is pronounced with the falling tone (shí).

**Note [Four]**
**Commentary:** Those who gallop in their strange disputations and deliver their perilous words have never paused to consider the mouths of *Taowu* 梼杌, yet they must contend in debate between Yang and Mo—thus, Yang and Mo become the masters of chaotic doctrines.

**Exegesis:** Yang was surnamed Yang, named Zhu 朱, styled Ziju 子居, a native of Song. Mo was surnamed Mo, named Di 翟, also a native of Song and a grandee of the state; because he practiced the Way of Mo, he was called Mo. These two, along with their followers, were by nature contentious, each capable of delivering lofty and perilous words, stirring the natures of things and obstinately clinging to right and wrong. Like knotted cords or hidden texts, they made their meanings difficult to unravel. Their minds roamed in the realm of learning, fixated solely on rigidly upholding "whiteness" and debating right and wrong, sameness and difference—never stepping beyond the domain of depraved men. *Bie* 蹩□ means "to hold fast," also describing the appearance of exertion. *Yu* 誉 means "to praise and extol." The followers of Yang and Mo, all priding themselves on their petty learning, dazzled the multitude, boasting of useless words and bewildering the masses. Thus, were Yang and Mo not the teachers of chaotic doctrines? This refers precisely to Yang and Mo.

◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Explanatory Notes* state that *bikui* 敝跬 means "the appearance of exerting effort beyond measure." Now, considering *kuiyu* 跬誉 as akin to *zhiyan* 咫言: In the *Fangyan*, half a step is called *kui* 跬. In the *Sima Fa*, lifting one foot is called *kui* 跬. *Kui* 跬 is three *chi* 尺. *Kuiyu* 跬誉 refers to seeking fleeting, short-lived praise. *Bi* 敝 is like the *bi* 敝 in the *Zhou Li*’s *Gong Ren* 弓人, where sinew is desired to be *bi* 敝, meaning "worn out." Exhausting one’s essence and wearying one’s spirit for near-term fame and empty words is thus called "riding alongside disputation."

**Note [Five]**
**Commentary:** These several masters all followed their natural endowments, branching and diverging like extra fingers, each being the orthodoxy of their own school. Yet to take one orthodoxy and impose it on the myriad things is to render the myriad things unorthodox. Thus, the perfectly orthodox do not use their own orthodoxy to govern the world but allow the world each to attain its own orthodoxy.

**Exegesis:** These several masters were all naturally intelligent and eloquent, like conjoined thumbs or extra fingers growing from the side—endowments of their original allotment, not the result of human effort. Thus, following one’s nature to be benevolent is the Way of branching and diverging. Yet the deluded, abandoning their own nature to imitate others, seek what lies beyond their allotment, ceaselessly swaying the natures of things. Since these several masters cause such agitation, to take one orthodoxy and impose it on the myriad things is not the perfect Dao or orthodox principle of the world.

**Explanatory Notes:**
- *Ci shu* 此数: *sezhu* 色主 tone. The same pronunciation applies to *ci shu* 此数 below.
**Collation:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition has *zhong* 钟 for *zhong* 锺.
(2) The Li character is amended following the *Shi De Tang* edition and the original *Explanatory Notes*.

Those who are perfectly orthodox do not lose the true nature of their lives and fates. Thus, what is conjoined is not called "extra," and what is branched is not called "extended"; what is long is not called "excessive," and what is short is not called "insufficient." Therefore, though the teal’s legs are short, lengthening them brings sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, cutting them brings grief. Thus, what is long by nature should not be cut, and what is short by nature should not be lengthened—there is no need to eliminate sorrow. Do benevolence and righteousness truly contravene human nature? Why then are those benevolent men so full of sorrow?

The current reading "正正" is erroneous and makes no coherent sense. Guo Xiang’s forced interpretation is incorrect.

【Note 2】When a branch is taken to correct the trunk, the trunk is then called "branched."

【Note 3】When the trunk is taken to correct a branch, the branch is then called "extended."

【Subcommentary】Viewing the trunk from the branch’s perspective, the trunk is called "branched," though in truth it is not; viewing the branch from the trunk’s perspective, the branch is called "extended," though in truth it is not.

【Pronunciation Notes】*《不为跂》* "qi" is read in reverse. Cui’s edition has "枝," homophonous. Some read it as *qu zhi*.

【Note 4】When the short is taken to correct the long, the long is then called "excessive."

【Note 5】When the long is taken to correct the short, the short is then called "insufficient."

【Subcommentary】The "long" refers to figures like Zengzi, Shizi, Li Kuang, Yang Zhu, and Mozi, who by their inborn nature possess accumulated benevolence and righteousness, keen intelligence, and eloquent debate. Compared to the common multitude, they are thus called "long," yet they act in accord with their nature, so they are not truly excessive. The "short" refers to the masses, who fall short when compared to Zengzi and the like, and are thus called "short," yet their natural mechanism unfolds of itself, so they are not truly insufficient.

【Note 6】Each has its own proper measure; one cannot use this to correct that and thereby diminish or augment it.

【Subcommentary】The *fu* is a small duck; the crane belongs to the *cang* family. *Jing* means "leg." The principle of spontaneity nurtures all forms, and though their lengths differ, each body is sufficient for its function, all attaining carefree wandering. Yet the deluded seek to sever the crane’s long legs and graft extensions onto the duck’s short ones to make them equal, deeply violating the workings of creation and contravening their original nature—hence their sorrow and grief.

【Pronunciation Notes】*《凫》* is read *fu*. *《胫》* is read *xing ding*.

Names and Explanations states: "It is called *jing* (stem), for it stands straight and long like the stem of a plant." Originally written as *wei*.

《鹤》 is pronounced *hu ge* (户各反).
《断之》 is pronounced *ding guan* (丁管反), and the same applies below and in the commentary.

【Seven】【Commentary】Knowing that their nature and allotment admit no severing or grafting and leaving them be, one has no need to dispel sorrow—for sorrow will depart of itself.

【Subcommentary】All receive their nature and form with fixed limits: long or short, bright or dim, their original allotment differs. This is like the duck and crane, which admit no severing or grafting. Thus, each abides within its own bounds, and though one need not labor to dispel sorrow, sorrow departs of itself.

【Pronunciation Notes】《去忧》 is pronounced *qi lv* (起吕反). The commentary’s *qu you* (去忧) and *qu* (去) are the same.

【Eight】【Commentary】Humaneness and rightness are simply part of human nature—one need only let them be.

【Pronunciation Notes】《意》 is read as the character itself (如字), and the same applies below. It may also be written as *yi* (医).

【Nine】【Commentary】To fear that humaneness and rightness are not part of human nature and thus be anxious about them—this truly may be called excessive sorrow.

【Subcommentary】Alas! An exclamation of sighing. The sentiment of humaneness and rightness arises from Heavenly principle, following one’s nature to be so—not through imitation. Those humane persons, like Zengzi and Shishu, fail to embody the true essence and instead arbitrarily promote and encourage, claiming the Way of humaneness and rightness can be learned and perfected. Master Zhuang deeply laments this delusion, hence his sigh. To draw things from beyond one’s proper bounds is what is meant by "excessive sorrow." "Is it not part of human nature?" means it is part of human nature.

【Textual Notes】
(1) The missing character: The Jiangnan ancient edition reads *qi* (岐) as *qi* (跂). The current text writes *qi* (跂), but it is suspected that the *Shiwen* (释文) notes "Cui’s edition writes *zhi* (枝)"—*zhi* (枝) being a corruption of *qi* (岐), hence the alternate pronunciation *qu zhi* (渠支反).
(2) The two characters *zhi wu* (之无) are deleted following Liu Wendian’s corrected edition, with *zhi* (之) attached to the following *yan* (言).
(3) *Qi fei* (其非) is amended to follow the main text.

Moreover, those born with conjoined toes weep when severed, while those with supernumerary fingers wail when bitten off. Whether exceeding or falling short of the natural count, their sorrow is one and the same. The humane of this age strain their eyes in distress over the world’s calamities, while the inhumane sever the essence of their nature to glut themselves on wealth and rank. Thus, does not the pretense of humaneness and rightness violate human nature? Since the Three Dynasties’ decline, why has the world grown so clamorous?

【Note 1】To deem it insufficient is to weep when severing; to deem it excessive is to wail when biting off. Though the myriad forms differ, none escape sorrow. Only by abiding in one’s Heaven-given nature—neither severing conjoined toes nor biting off extra fingers—can things curve to completion without harm. What sorrow then remains?

【Exegesis】*Hé* (龁) means to gnaw through; *jué* (决) means to separate. "Exceeding the count" refers to a sixth finger; "falling short" refers to four conjoined toes. These two—conjoined toes and extra fingers—arise naturally. One should simply leave them be, for they are neither excess nor deficiency. Yet the deluded cannot let go of their indifference, stubbornly clinging to right and wrong. They deem extra fingers excessive and conjoined toes insufficient, arbitrarily severing and biting to conform to the count of five. Having harmed creation’s work, they weep and wail. Thus, though the methods of severing and biting differ, their sorrow is one.

【Phonetic Gloss】*Hé* (龁): Li’s pronunciation *hé* (纥), *hènfǎ* (恨发) rhyme; to bite through. Xu’s pronunciation *húwù* (胡勿) rhyme; Guo’s pronunciation *hútū* (胡突) rhyme. *Tí* (啼): Pronounced *tí* (提). Cui’s edition writes *dì* (谛).

【Note 2】If the traces of universal love are exalted, the world’s eyes grow confused. To exalt such traces, then lament the existence of calamities, is to plunge people into peril before rescuing them. Yet this is precisely what the present age calls humaneness.

【Exegesis】*Hāo* (蒿) means to strain one’s eyes in confusion. Humaneness is the trace of universal love. "This age" refers to the degenerate era.

The followers of Zengzi and Shun, practicing this universal love, lead the deluded to abandon themselves and imitate others. Once the path of seeking fortune is opened, the functions of ears and eyes grow confused. When ears and eyes are confused, calamities and difficulties arise; thus, they worry over the turmoil and seek to remedy it with humaneness and righteousness. Yet they do not know that the source of calamities and difficulties lies in the traces of the sages.

【Phonetic Gloss】*Hāomù* (蒿目): Pronounced *hǎogāo* (好羔) in rhyme. Sima: "Confusion." Li: "*Hāomù*, the appearance of a quick temper." ◎ Lu Wenchang: "In the current edition, *kuài* (快) is written as *jué* (决)." ◎ Yu Yue: "Sima and Guo’s annotations both treat *hāomù* as a single phrase, interpreting it as 'to confuse the world’s eyes,' but this meaning is hardly sound. *Hāo* is a loan character for *□*. The *Yupian* under the *mù* (目) radical: *□*, pronounced *yǔjū* (庾鞠), meaning 'eyes bright' or 'gazing afar.' Thus, *□* describes the appearance of distant gazing. The humane, grieving over the world’s ills, must gaze far into the distance, hence 'gazing afar (*□mù*) at the world’s woes.' *□* and *hāo* share similar ancient pronunciations, allowing for interchange. The *Lingtai* chapter of the *Book of Songs* writes *bái niǎo hèhè* (白鸟翯翯), while the *Mencius* (*Liang Hui Wang*) writes *hèhè* (鹤鹤), and the *Wen Xuan* (*Jingfu Palace Rhapsody*) writes *□□*. Thus, *hāo* interchangeable with *□* is akin to *hè* interchangeable with *hè* or *□*. The *Wenyan* commentary of the *Book of Changes* states: *quèhū qí bù kě bá* (确乎其不可拔). The *Shuowen* under the *tǔ* (土) radical: *què* (确), meaning 'firm and unshakable,' directly follows the *Changes*. This confirms that *què* and *què* are interchangeable, another example of such usage." *Hāolìng* (蒿令): Pronounced *lìchéng* (力呈) in rhyme, same below. *Yú nàn* (于难): Pronounced *nǎidàn* (乃旦) in rhyme. *Hòu zhěng* (后拯): *Zhěng* as in "to rescue."

【Note 3】Wealth and nobility become objects of greed precisely because there are those who exalt them. If no such exalted traces existed, people would rest content in their allotted stations, measure their strength to accept their tasks, and how could they sever themselves to imitate others, coveting what is beyond their reach?

【Exegesis】*Tāo* (饕) means to covet wealth. Those who, by nature, do not embrace humaneness and righteousness are called inhumane. Their intent lies in greedily pursuing rank and emolument, stealthily grasping at wealth and nobility. Thus, they sever their innate nature, lose the true essence of their allotted fate, and distort their nature with falsity, abandoning themselves to chase external things. This corruption arises precisely because the traces of the sages are exalted. From this, we know that to return to simplicity and restore purity, one must reject humaneness and abandon righteousness.

【Phonetic Gloss】*Tāo* (饕): Pronounced *tǔdāo* (吐刀) in rhyme. Du Yu’s commentary on the *Zuozhuan* states: "To covet wealth is called *tāo*."

【Note 4】This further reinforces the preceding point.

◎ Jiao Qingfan’s note: *Yì* (意) is read as *yì* (抑). *Yì* may also be written as *yì* (意), a grammatical particle. In the *Lunyu* (*Xue Er*), *yì yǔ zhī yǔ* (抑与之与) appears in the Han Stone Classics as *yì* (意). The *Mozi* (*Fei Ming*) reads: *yì jiāng yǐ wéi lì tiānxià hū* (意将以为利天下乎), the *Yanzi Chunqiu* (*Za Pian*) reads: *yì zhě fēi chén zhī zuì hū* (意者非臣之罪乎), and the *Hanshu* (*Xu Zhuan*) states: *qí yì zhě cónghéng zhī shì fù qǐ yú jīn hū* (其抑者从横之事复起于今乎). *Yì* (抑) and *yì* (意) are the same, and all follow the same grammatical pattern as this sentence. Whether written as *yì zhě* (意者) or simply *yì* (意), the meaning remains identical.

【Note 5】Humaneness and righteousness are, after all, natural to human feelings. Yet since the Three Dynasties, people have clamorously abandoned true nature to chase after traces, as if they could not keep up—is this not a cause for much sorrow?

【Exegesis】*Zì* (自) means "to follow." The Three Dynasties refer to the Xia, Yin, and Zhou. *Xiāoxiāo* (嚣嚣) is like *huānguō* (讙聒). Humaneness and righteousness arise from natural feelings. Yet since the Three Dynasties, people have abandoned true nature to pursue traces, clamorously competing—how foolish this is! Thus, the Xia practiced humaneness, the Yin practiced righteousness, and the Zhou practiced ritual, all exemplifying this *xiāoxiāo* state.

【Phonetic Gloss】*Xiāoxiāo* (嚣嚣): Pronounced *xǔqiáo* (许桥) in rhyme, or *wǔgāo* (五羔) in rhyme. The *Zilin* states: "A sound." Cui: "The appearance of grieving over the world."

【Collation Notes】
(1) The Shide Hall edition reads *jǔ* (舉) instead of the received text.
(2) The original *Shiwen* carving reads *kuài* (快), while the Shide Hall edition reads *jué* (决).
(3) The Shide Hall edition reads *chéng* (乘) for *qì* (弃).

Moreover, those who rely on hooks, marking lines, compasses, and squares to achieve correctness are but carvers of their own nature. Those who depend on cords, glue, and lacquer to achieve firmness are but invaders of their own power. Those who bend and twist with ritual and music, who coo and soothe with humaneness and righteousness to comfort the hearts of the world—these have lost their constant natural state.

The world possesses a constant natural state. In this constant state, the curved need no hook, the straight need no marking line, the round need no compass, the square need no square tool, the joined need no glue or lacquer, and the bound need no ropes. Thus, the world is allured into life yet knows not why it lives; all alike attain yet know not why they attain. Therefore, from ancient times to the present, this has never varied—it cannot be diminished.

Why then should humaneness and righteousness cling like glue, lacquer, and ropes, wandering between the Dao and virtue, thereby confusing the world?

【Exegesis I】
*Gōu* (钩) means "curved"; *shéng* (绳), "straight"; *guī* (规), "round"; *jǔ* (矩), "square." Things rely on hooks, marking lines, compasses, and squares to become curved, straight, round, or square—this is not their Heaven-bestowed nature. By analogy, those who await teachings and traces to practice humaneness and righteousness do not act from their true nature. To move with genuine spontaneity requires no borrowed learning. Thus, those who distort their nature and feign their feelings, abandoning themselves to imitate others in practicing humaneness and righteousness, are but diminishing and damaging their Heaven-bestowed nature.

【Exegesis II】
*Yuē* (约) means "to bind"; *gù* (固), "firm." *Qīn* (侵) means "to harm." *Dé* (德) means "true wisdom." Those who rely on ropes to bind and glue and lacquer to secure are but borrowing external things—they do not achieve true firmness. By analogy, those who study Zengzi and Shishu to practice humaneness are but feigning and falsifying—they do not act from their true nature. Having deviated from their original nature, they thus harm their own power.

【Exegesis III】
*Qū* (屈) means "to bend"; *zhé* (折), "to sever." *Xǔyú* (呴俞) is akin to "nurturing and caressing." To bend the straight into the crooked is to impose ritual with its nodal refinements; to sever the long to fit the short is to practice music of boundless dissipation. Nurturing partial love as humaneness, caressing rigid traces as righteousness—such is to counterfeit the true with the false, to soothe the hearts of things. Thereby, things lose their truth, people forsake their root. Having abandoned the root to chase the branch, they thus forfeit their constant, spontaneous nature. This then summarizes the errors of the preceding text to give rise to the gains of what follows.

【Textual Notes】
*Qū* (屈): Cui’s edition writes *qū* (诎).
*Zhé* (折): Read as *zhìrè* (之热反), meaning to bend and break the limbs for ritual and music.
*Xǔ* (呴): Read as *kuàngyú* (况于反); Li reads *kuàngfù* (况付反). Another version writes *yǔ* (伛), read as *yúyǔ* (于禹反).
*Yú* (俞): Read as *yú* (音臾); Li reads *yù* (音喻). Another version writes *xǔ* (呴), read as *xǔ* (音诩), meaning to soften the countenance in the guise of humaneness and righteousness.

【Exegesis IV】
Now, the myriad things of the world each possess their constant allotment. For instance, the smartweed bends while the hemp is straight; heads are round and feet square. Water congeals in winter and melts in summer; fish gather in spring and scatter in autumn. These arise from natural spontaneity, not borrowed from other things—how could hooks, ropes, compasses, squares, glue, lacquer, or twisted cords be applied to them! As it is with form, so too with nature. Thus, ritual, music, humaneness, and righteousness are but disorders of Heaven’s warp. Another explanation: *fùlí* (附离), where *lí* (离) means "to depend." Hence, the *Book of Han* states that in Emperor Ai’s time, those who attached themselves to the Dong clan all rose to ranks of two thousand bushels. The commentary explains: *lí* (离) means "to depend."

【Textual Notes】
*Mò* (纆): Read as *mò* (音墨). The *Guangya* says: "a cord."
*Suǒ* (索): Read as *xīgé* (悉各反). The same below.

【Annotation V】
Things possess their constant thusness. Left to themselves without interference, they merge into self-contentment without self-awareness.

【Exegesis V】
Spontaneously generating things, endowed with qi and receiving form—some square, some round, now bent, now straight—nurtured and poisoned, each suffices in its nature. None discerns its own thusness, all unaware of how they come to be. How could they deliberate on conditions or bind their feelings to gain and loss! Thus, to bend, sever, nurture, and caress is to lose their constancy.

【Annotation VI】
Being of the same stuff as things, one remains undivided from them and ever whole.

【Exegesis VI】
To perceive beginning and end as not one is the blindness of common feeling; to behold past and present as undivided is the luminous insight of sagely wisdom. Thus, though not born, they are born, yet know not how they are born; though not attained, they are attained, yet know not how they are attained. Though time may pass from past to present, the Dao suffers no loss. Amid a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, it remains ever one.

【Annotation VII】
Following the Dao and attaining it, one embraces simplicity and wanders alone, ceaselessly borrowing from things yet acting without contrivance.

【Exegesis VII】
What is the *Dao*? It is neither being nor non-being, neither arising nor ceasing, not to be sought through sagely wisdom—how then could it be grasped through forms and names! Yet the likes of Zengzi and Shishu, their natures steeped in humaneness, lead others by their own example, mired in the web of names and teachings. Their bonds resemble knotted cords, their fixations like glue and lacquer. Heart linking to heart, they continue unbroken. Those who cling to such conduct and wander in the realm of the Dao are like trying to learn squares with circles, or fish longing to be birds—vainly aspiring to the name, never attaining the reality. Forgetting not the fish and hare, they lose the straw dogs already cast aside. What value is there in this!

【Textual Notes】
*Liánlián* (连连): Sima explains: "to continuously practice humaneness and righteousness while wandering in the realm of the Dao."

【Annotation VIII】
The continuous practice of humaneness and righteousness only suffices to delude things, causing them to lose their truth.

【Exegesis VIII】
The teachings of humaneness and righteousness, the traces of wisdom—these deviate from the natural Dao and disorder the hearts of the world.

【Textual Notes】
*Zhǐzú* (祇足): Read as *zhī* (音支).
*Shǐsàng* (使丧): Read as *xīlàng* (息浪反). The same for *yǐsàng* (已丧) below.

A minor delusion confuses direction; a great delusion confuses nature. How do we know this is so? Since the time of the Yu clan, when humaneness and righteousness were summoned to disturb the world, none have not rushed to answer the call of humaneness and righteousness. Is this not to exchange their nature for humaneness and righteousness? Let us then examine this: from the Three Dynasties onward, none in the world have not exchanged their nature for things. The petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar, for fame; the grandee, for his house; the sage, for the world. Thus, though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations bear different names, in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one. Zang and Gu, two men herding sheep together, both lost their sheep. Asked what Zang was doing, he held a bamboo slip and read; asked what Gu was doing, he played at dice and gambled. Though their undertakings differed, in losing their sheep they were the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang; Robber Zhi died for profit upon Dongling. Though their deaths differed, in maiming their lives and harming their natures, they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is wholly given to sacrifice. Those who sacrifice do so for humaneness and righteousness.

Those whose sacrifice is for humaneness and righteousness, the world calls "noble men"; those whose sacrifice is for wealth and property, the world calls "petty men." Their sacrifice is one and the same, yet there are noble men and petty men among them. But if we consider the maiming of life and harm to nature, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi—what place is there for noble and petty between them?

---

**Note to [1]:** When east and west exchange directions, the body remains unharmed; but to pride oneself on humaneness and exalt righteousness is to lose one’s constant nature. To die for these is utter delusion.
**Explanation:** To take south for north is a minor confusion; to cling to traces and lose the real is a greater delusion.

---

**Explanation:** So it is. This sets up a hypothetical question to introduce what follows.

---

**Note to [3]:** One who does no harm to things is not acting for humaneness, yet the traces of humaneness appear; one who makes all principles accord is not acting for righteousness, yet the effects of righteousness are seen. Thus, what accords and does no harm is not the lure of humaneness and righteousness. Yet the world rushes about, abandoning the self to pursue the other and lose its constant nature. Therefore, the mind is not disordered by ugliness but ever by beauty; the age is not troubled by evil but ever by humaneness and righteousness—so humaneness and righteousness are the tools that disorder the world.
**Explanation:** Yu refers to Shun. *Zhao* means "to attract." *Nao* means "to disorder." Before the time of Tang Yao, people still preserved their simplicity; after Yu Shun, the pure wind gradually scattered. Thus, with the traces of humaneness, righteousness, and sagely virtue, he attracted the common people, causing the multitudes of the world to rush about in confusion, losing their lives and following sagely traces.

---

**Note to [4]:** Though the House of Yu did not alter the true nature of things, the nature of the world was already altered.
**Explanation:** From this we see that the use of humaneness, righteousness, and sagely traces has disordered the world, causing the common people to abandon the root and pursue the branch, altering their Heaven-given nature.

---

**Note to [5]:** Before the Three Dynasties, there were indeed traces of non-action. Yet even the traces of non-action are what men of action esteem, and to esteem them is to lose one’s natural plainness. Thus, though the sage has no choice, he may exchange the nature of effortless rule for the affairs of toil and hardship—how much more so the common people!
**Explanation:** Before the Five Emperors, the wind of non-action still prevailed; after the Three Dynasties, the teachings of action gradually arose. Different ages, different customs—so people abandoned themselves to imitate others, their true nature stolen away. To sacrifice oneself for things and never return—is this not lamentable? The note says, "to exchange the nature of effortless rule for the affairs of toil and hardship"—*pan yi* means "wounds." It speaks of Yu of Xia, who endured wind and rain, his hands and feet calloused, exchanging this toil for the work of non-action. If even the ruler does this, how much more the people below!

The term *pan yi* is read as written, meaning "wounds." According to the characters, it should be written as *ban yi*.

**Six**
**Note:** The quail dwells in nests and the fledgling feeds on regurgitation; birds fly without pattern—what do they惜 and refuse to殉? Thus, they remain ever in harmony with the world, adapting to whatever they encounter. Their traces are the traces of殉 to the world; what they meet may at times bring the changes of *pan yi* and bare shins—these are the traces of wounding one’s nature. Yet though they roam the eight directions, their spirit and *qi* remain unchanged; though their hands and feet bear *pan yi*, the one who dwells in form is not disturbed. Then what do they殉? They殉 nothing. Thus, they do not殉 what they殉, yet their traces are the same as those who殉 to the world.

**Exposition:** *Xun* means "to follow," "to strive for," "to seek," or "to pursue"—it refers to what the body follows. The petty man covets profit; the upright scholar values reputation; the great officer殉 for his family; the emperor strives for the four seas. Though what they殉 differs, their alteration of nature is the same. Yet the sage remains ever in harmony with the world, and though his traces are those of殉, he may endure the changes of *ban yi* and bare shins without ever burdening his spirit.

**Exegesis:** *Xun*: read *cí jùn* (辞俊反), or *cí lún* (辞伦反) in Xu’s pronunciation. Sima explains: "to strive for." Cui explains: "to kill oneself in following is called *xun*."
*Chun*: pronounced *chún* (纯), or *dūn* (敦).
*Kou*: pronounced *kǒu dòu* (口豆反).
*Tu*: pronounced *tū mù* (吐木反).
*Hui chi*: the first read *huī* (挥), the second *chì* (赤).

**Seven**
**Exposition:** The "several figures" refer to the four men from the Three Dynasties onward mentioned earlier. "Affairs and undertakings" refer to their differing pursuits of profit and reputation across the world. "Names and reputations" refer to the distinct titles of the petty man, the scholar, the great officer, and the sage. Though these four differ in their affairs and undertakings, and their names and reputations are not the same, in their harm to life and pursuit of things with their bodies, they are not unequal.

**Eight**
**Exposition:** This continues the previous analogy to introduce what follows. Mencius says: *Zang* is one who excels at learning from others; *Gu* is a young child. Yang Xiong says: a male slave’s son-in-law is called *zang*; *gu* is a child of good family. *Mu* means "to tend"; *wang* means "to lose." These two, each absorbed in their affairs, both lost their sheep.

**Exegesis:** *Zang*: read *zuò láng* (作郎反). Cui explains: "one who loves books is called *zang*." *Fangyan* says: "In the northern borders of Qi and the northern outskirts of Yan, a common man who marries a slave is called *zang*; a woman who marries a slave is called *huo*."
*Zang yu Gu*: read as written. *Erya* says: "good."
Cui’s version has a blank, explaining: "a child is called □."
*Mu yang*: *mu* as in "to tend and raise."

**Nine**
**Exposition:** *Xi* means "what." *Ce* means "bamboo slips." Ancient people had no paper and wrote books on bamboo slips. Moving five paths and casting jade pieces is called *bo*; without casting, it is called *sai*. Whether asking *Zang* or asking *Gu*, there is a difference in their books and *sai*, yet in tending sheep and losing sheep, there is truly no difference.

**Exegesis:** *Xie*: pronounced *xié* (协).
*Ce*: also written as *策*, pronounced *chū gé* (初革反). Li explains: "bamboo slips for writing, two feet and four inches long."
*Bo sai*: pronounced *xī dài* (悉代反). *Sai* is a type of *bo*. *Hanshu* says: "Wu Qiu Shouwang was summoned as an attendant for his skill in *ge wu*, referring to *bo sai*."

**Ten**
**Exposition:** This concludes the analogy. Boyi and Shuqi were both sons of the Lord of Guzhu. Guzhu was a descendant of Shennong, of the Jiang clan. Boyi’s name was Yun, courtesy name Gongxin; Shuqi’s name was Zhi, courtesy name Gongyuan. Boyi was the elder but born of a concubine; Shuqi was younger but born of the primary wife. Their father favored Shuqi and often praised him to Boyi. When their father died, the brothers yielded the succession to each other and did not inherit the former fief. Hearing of King Wen’s virtue, they went to Zhou. When King Wu campaigned against Zhou, they grasped his horse’s bridle to remonstrate. Their advice was not heeded, so they fled to Mount Shouyang, where they gathered ferns for food and refused to eat Zhou grain, eventually starving to death on Mount Shouyang. The mountain is in Hedong County, Pu Prefecture. Thirty *li* south of Pu Prefecture’s city, the temple and tomb of Boyi and Shuqi can still be seen, with dense forests and towering trees.

Da Zhi was the younger cousin of Liuxia Hui, named Zhi. He led nine thousand followers as a great bandit, hence his name. Dongling was a mountain name, also said to be Mount Tai, located in Qi Prefecture, fifteen *li* from Dongping, where Zhi died.

**Exegesis:** *Shouyang*: a mountain name in Puban County, Hedong. "Died" refers to starving to death.
*Dongling*: Li explains: "Mount Tai." Another says: "a mound name, now called Dongpingling, under Jinan Commandery."
◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Wenxuan*’s "Preface to Wang Wenxian’s Collected Works" cites Sima: "Dongling is a mound name, now under Jinan." Omitted in the *Exegesis*.

**Eleven**
**Exposition:** Boyi died for reputation beneath Mount Shouyang; Da Zhi coveted profit and perished on Dongling. Though what they died for—reputation and profit—differed, in their harm and injury, they were not distinct.

**Twelve**
**Note:** What the world cherishes is life. Now, to殉 it so excessively that life is harmed in both cases means the right and wrong of what they殉 are no longer worth discussing.

**Exposition:** From the worldly perspective, there is good and evil; from the Dao’s perspective, what is right and what is wrong? Thus, Da Zhi is not necessarily wrong, nor is Boyi uniquely right.
◎ Qing Fan’s note: *A Comprehensive Sound Glossary of All Scriptures*, volume 89, citing *Biographies of Eminent Monks of the Liang*, volume 4, records Sima: "Da Zhi was a violent and evil man." Omitted in the *Exegesis*.

**Thirteen**
**Exposition:** This summarizes the preceding to establish what follows. Yet the Dao has been lost for so long that none of this is fitting. Now, in the俗世, all are殉 to something—how could it be only Boyi and Robber Zhi? Those who follow benevolence and righteousness have never departed from fame; those who chase after wealth and property are bound to pursue profit. Fame and profit alone are the roots of harming life. They are not the heavenly principle but arise from worldly sentiment. Thus, neither the noble man nor the petty man can be taken as a true standard.

**Fourteen**
**Note:** The world all considers not harming to be good. Now, since all equally harm life, though what they殉 differs, it is no longer worth calculating. Why is life harmed? Why is nature altered? It is all due to esteeming the traces of non-action. If one knows that traces arise from non-action and are thereby completed, then one will cease esteeming excess and return to the profound limit of the self. Yao and Jie will be equal in self-attainment—how then can one distinguish between the noble man and the petty man?

**Exposition:** What is evil? Those who殉 to fame and profit may differ as noble men and petty men, but in harming life and damaging nature, there is no distinction between Robber Zhi and Boyi. This is merely the world’s inversion, unrelated to the true ultimate. By what can one take the noble man? By what can one distinguish the petty man? There is no difference.

**Exegesis:** *"You wu"* (又恶) is read as *wu* (乌). *"Qu junzi xiaoren yu qi jian zai"* (取君子小人于其间哉): The Cui edition omits *"xiaoren yu"* (小人于).

**Collation:**
(1) The character *zhi* (之) is supplied following Wang Shu-min’s suggestion.
(2) The character *jia* (家) is supplied following the main text.
(3) The character *xu* (序) is emended to *xu* (序) following *Wen Xuan*.
(4) The character *bian* (辨) is emended following the Shide Tang edition.

Moreover, those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness, though as accomplished as Zeng [Can] and Shi [Yu], are not what I call good. Those who bind their nature to the five flavors, though as accomplished as Yu Er, are not what I call good. Those who bind their nature to the five sounds, though as accomplished as Music Master Kuang, are not what I call keen of hearing. Those who bind their nature to the five colors, though as accomplished as Li Zhu, are not what I call clear of sight.

What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness but being good in one’s virtue alone. What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness but following the natural tendencies of one’s nature and destiny. What I call keen of hearing is not hearing others but hearing oneself. What I call clear of sight is not seeing others but seeing oneself.

Those who do not see themselves but see others, who do not attain themselves but attain others, attain others’ attainment but do not attain their own attainment, follow others’ following but do not follow their own following. Those who follow others’ following but do not follow their own following—whether Robber Zhi or Boyi—are equally excessive and perverse.

I am ashamed before the Dao and virtue. Therefore, above, I dare not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not engage in excessive and perverse actions.

**One**
**Note:** To bind this to that is called *shu* (属). Binding one’s nature to benevolence is merely殉 to benevolence, hence it is not good.

**Exposition:** *Shu* (属) means to bind. *Zang* (臧) means good. *Wu* (吾) refers to Zhuangzi himself. To abandon oneself and imitate others, to gain things and lose oneself—these are the false sentiments of the俗世. Thus, to bind one’s heavenly nature and learn benevolence and righteousness from others, though as accomplished as following the traces of sages like Zeng Can and Shi Yu, is contrary to one’s original nature. Therefore, it is not what the discourse on life calls good.

**Exegesis:** *"Shu qi"* (属其): Guo reads *shu* (时欲反), meaning to bind. Xu reads *zhu* (烛), meaning to attach. The same applies below.

**Two**
**Note:** Following one’s nature to master flavors is good.

**Exposition:** Mencius said: Yu Er was a man of Qi skilled in flavors. The *Shizi* said: Yu Er harmonized ginger and cinnamon for the ruler’s meals. To lack one’s own heavenly nature and imitate things to gain knowledge—even if one is as accomplished as Yu Er, it is not good.

**Exegesis:** *"Sui tong ru Yang Mo"* (虽通如杨墨): One edition omits this sentence. *"Yu Er"* (俞儿): Read as *yu* (榆). Li Shi reads *yu* (榆反). Sima: An ancient expert in flavors. Cui: The *Shizi* says: The chef Yu Er harmonized ginger and cinnamon for the ruler’s meals. The *Huainanzi* says: Yu Er and Yi Ya tasted the waters of the Zi and Mian rivers and distinguished them. One says: Yu Er was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time. Yi Ya is then Yi Ya, the expert in flavors of Duke Huan of Qi’s time. Another says: Yu Er was also a man of Qi. The *Huainanzi* writes *Shen Er* (申儿) in one edition; it is suspected that *shen* (申) should be *yu* (臾).

**Three**
**Note:** Not entrusting it to oneself but binding it to others—though as accomplished as them, one has already lost oneself. Thus, to each follow the use of their own ears and eyes without binding them to Li Zhu or Music Master Kuang is true keen hearing and clear sight.

**Exposition:** Li Zhu and Music Master Kuang were endowed with keen hearing and clear sight, able to follow their nature without learning. Now, to distort one’s nature and feign sentiment, to abandon oneself and imitate things—though accomplished, it is not worthy of praise.

**Four**
**Note:** Good at self-attainment, forgetting benevolence in benevolence.

**Exposition:** *De* (德) means attainment. Those who penetrate the profound Dao do not alter their nature to殉 to things. How could they cling to the worn-out straw dogs of the past or stagnate in the temporary lodges of former kings? Thus, one should know oneself, attain one’s own attainment—this is good. Is it not fitting?

**Five**
**Note:** To call benevolence and righteousness good is to harm oneself to殉 to them. This is not benevolent toward one’s own nature and destiny. If the self is not benevolent, how can one be benevolent toward others? Thus, to follow one’s nature and destiny is to be able to reach others. Reaching others without burdening oneself, both self and others equally attaining themselves—this can be called good.

**Exposition:** As for Zeng Shen, Shi Yu, Yang Zhu, and Mo Di—these four practiced benevolence and righteousness, yet they followed their nature and gave free rein to their emotions, receiving them as Heaven’s mandate. Like creatures with fused limbs, their conduct was not acquired through learning. The deluded, however, observing the benevolence and righteousness of Zeng and Shi, claim that imitation can achieve the same; hearing of Li Zhuang’s and Kuang’s intelligence, they believe such attainment is surely within reach. How could they know that these were shaped by the Creator’s nurturing power! Thus, Wang Bi’s commentary on the *Yijing* states: "Without embodying one’s nature in emotion, how can one long sustain its fulfillment?" This is what is meant here.

**Six**
**Note:** To sever oneself from detachment and abandon emptiness, relying instead on what one has heard and seen, is to exhaust all the world’s intelligence and clarity.

**Exposition:** Those who yearn for Li Zhuang and admire Kuang, chasing after what they hear and see, scatter their spirit and exhaust their ears and eyes—this is folly, not intelligence or clarity. If one listens only to what the ear can hear and sees only what the eye can see, preserving one’s allotted nature and remaining true to it without straying outward, then all things become intelligent and clear.

**Seven**
**Note:** This is to abandon oneself and imitate others. Though one may imitate them as if becoming them, one’s self is already lost.

**Exposition:** Those who cannot see what their eyes see but instead strain their sight to seek Li Zhuang’s clarity, or who cannot know what their knowledge knows but instead exhaust their intellect to emulate Shi Yu’s righteousness—these merely feign the attainment of others through learning, not the self-attainment of following one’s nature. Having thus fabricated learning to display outwardly and imitated others to please them, their hearts labor in pretense, and so they cannot attain their own fulfillment.

**Eight**
**Note:** If one takes the loss of nature as excess and perversity, then though the paths of loss may differ, the fact of loss is one and the same.

**Exposition:** *Yin* means stagnation; *pi* means perversity. Preserving one’s allotted nature and following the true Way—this is the correct path. Pursuing fame and striving for superiority—this is excess and perversity. Thus, those who abandon themselves to chase things, opening the road of vain hope, are no different in their perversity, whether they be Boyi in his goodness or Robber Zhi in his wickedness. The repetition of "attaining others’ fulfillment" here serves to link the preceding and following passages and strengthen the rhetorical flow.

**Nine**
**Note:** Ashamed of not embodying the Dao and the virtue, and repenting the absence of traces in profound return, one severs all conduct, forgets fame and profit, moves with ease through burdens, and leaves the self and others behind—this is all there is to it.

**Exposition:** The Way of emptiness and penetration, the virtue of utter forgetting—this is to renounce benevolence and righteousness, to abandon profit and fame. Yet Master Zhuang, subtly embodying the center of the circle and roaming beyond things, held his aspirations and conduct free of benevolence and righteousness, his heart and actions forgetful of right and wrong. Embodying the naturalness of non-being, he was ashamed of not enacting the Dao and virtue. The mention of "above and below" here distinguishes the superiority and inferiority of benevolence, righteousness, excess, and perversity. Saying "I dare not" expresses humility. Guo Xiang’s note on "moving with ease through burdens" explains: *Congrong* means leisurely and unconstrained; "blowing burdens" means acting without intent. *Chui* is wind; *lei* is dust—like a pure breeze stirring, lifting light dust.

---

**One**
**Note:** A nag and a fine steed each suffice for their own body and needs.

**Exposition:** The title refers to the subject matter of the passage. A horse’s hooves can tread frost and snow, its coat can ward off wind and cold; when hungry, it grazes, when thirsty, it drinks; when at ease and content, it lifts its hooves and leaps—this is the horse’s true nature. Though there be grand halls and stately chambers, they are of no use to it. Yet when Bo Le arrives, saying, "I am skilled in managing horses," he burns them, brands them, carves them, and paints them; he binds them with reins and fetters, confines them to black stables—and of the horses, two or three in ten die. He starves them, parches them, gallops them, races them, disciplines and aligns them; before them lies the peril of bit and ornament, behind them the threat of whip and lash—and of the horses, more than half die.

The potter says, "I am skilled in managing clay: the round fit the compass, the square the carpenter’s square." The craftsman says, "I am skilled in managing wood: the curved fit the hook, the straight the marking line." Yet do the nature of clay and wood desire to fit compass, square, hook, and line? Nevertheless, generation after generation, people praise them, saying, "Bo Le is skilled in managing horses, and the potter and craftsman are skilled in managing clay and wood"—this is also the error of those who govern the world.

"□ signifies a horse’s vigor." ◎Qingfan’s note: *Shiwen* cites Cui’s edition as reading "翘尾" (*qiáo wěi*, "raised tail") and quotes Sima: "陆 (*lù*), to leap." The character book writes □, glossing it as "a horse’s vigor." Now, the reading "足 (*zú*, 'hoof')" as "尾 (*wěi*, 'tail')" is correct. *Wenxuan*’s commentary on Guo Jingchun’s *Jiang Fu* cites *Zhuangzi* as writing "尾" for "足" and "陆" for "陆," noting: "陆 (*lù*), pronounced *liù*." *Guangyun*: "陆 (*lù*), *lìzhú* cut, to prance." *Lù* should properly be written as □. *Shuowen*: "□, crooked shin, read like *kuí*." Thus *lù* is a variant of □. *Kuí* takes *lù* as its phonetic, while *lù* takes *zú* (foot) and *lù* as components; ancient characters for "foot" were often interchangeable, their forms being similar. Judging from the *Wenxuan* commentary, *lù* is a corruption of *lù*. 《驽》 (*nú*), pronounced *nú*, a poor horse. 《骥》 (*jì*), pronounced *jì*, a thousand-*li* steed.

【二】【Annotation】The horse’s true nature does not abhor the saddle to reject riding, but simply has no desire for glory and splendor. 【Exegesis】*Yì* (義) means "nourishment," referring to the towers and terraces where the nobility keep their guards. It is also said: *Yìtái* (義台) is like *Língtái* (靈台, "Spirit Terrace"). *Lù* (路) means "grand" or "proper," referring to the main hall of the proper residence. The nature of the horse delights in the open wilds; though there be lofty towers and grand halls, they are of no use to it. How much more for the man of pure emptiness or the people of unadorned simplicity—content with thatched eaves and earthen windows, what care they for vermilion pillars and carved rafters!

【*Shiwen*】《義》 (*yì*), *xǔyí* cut, or read as written. Xu’s edition matches Cui’s. One version writes *xī* (羲). 《台》 (*tái*): Cui says, "*Yìtái* is like *Língtái*." 《路寝》 (*lùqǐn*): *Lù* means "proper" or "grand." Cui says, "*Lùqǐn* is the main chamber." ◎Qingfan’s note: *Shiji*’s *Wei Shijia Suoyin* cites Sima: "*Yìtái* is the name of a terrace." *Shiwen* omits this. ◎Yu Yue says: *Yì* is read *yí* in Xu’s edition, and this should be followed. *Zhouguan*’s *Sishi* office, Zheng’s commentary: "The old text writes *yí* (儀) as *yì* (義)." Thus *yì* is the ancient form of *yí*. *Yítái* (儀台) is like *Róngtái* (容台, "Reception Terrace"). *Huainanzi*’s *Lanming* chapter: "The *Róngtái* shook and collapsed." Gao’s commentary: "*Róngtái* is the terrace for conducting rites." *Yí* and *róng* differ in name but share the same reality, being the terrace for performing rituals—hence *Yítái*. 《而恶》 (*érwù*), *wūlù* cut.

【三】【Annotation】To intend to govern it is to fail to govern it.

To govern with goodness is to lack goodness.

【Annotation】*Liezi* states: His surname was Sun, given name Yang, courtesy name Bo Le, a man of the Qin Duke Mu’s time skilled in managing horses. *Shao* means to sear with hot iron. *Ti* refers to shearing the hair; *ke* refers to trimming the hooves; *luo* refers to fitting a bridle. *Ji* means to hobble the legs; *zhi* means to bind the front two legs. *Zao* refers to the manger and stable; *zhan* means planks of wood woven into a bed, placed beneath the horse’s feet to ward off dampness—what is called a "horse bed." Now, if one cannot follow the horse’s true nature but forcibly sears and shears it, this already violates Heaven’s principle, and many have died as a result. How much more so when one acts without intention, yielding to things, thus preserving life and nature; yet when one governs with intent, the natural lifespan is thereby cut short.

【*Shiwen*】*Bo Le*: pronounced *luo*, same below. Bo Le, surname Sun, given name Yang, skilled in driving horses. *Shishi Xingjing* states: Bo Le is the name of a celestial star, charged with overseeing heavenly horses. Sun Yang was skilled in driving, hence the name. *Ti zhi*: *chihi* (shear) reflex. *Zilin* says: to shave. Xu’s pronunciation: *shichi*. Xiang and Cui’s edition writes *ti* (剃). Xiang’s pronunciation: *hao*. *Luo zhi*: pronounced *luo*. Sima says: *shao* means to burn with iron; *ti* means to shear the hair; *ke* means to pare the hooves; *luo* means to bridle the head. ◎Wang Niansun says: Sima Biao says *luo* means to bridle and halter the head. Now, *luo* should be read as *luò* (音落), a character sometimes written as □, interchangeable with *luo* (雒) or *luò* (落). *Luò* signifies "to fall," meaning to strip away hair, mane, and hooves—this is called *luò*. *Shuowen* says: *luò* means to pare. *Guangya* says: *luo* means to shear. *Wuzi Zhibing Pian* describes the method of raising horses: "pare the hair, mane, and hooves, carefully trimming all around." This passage—"sear it, shear it, pare it, *luo* it"—closely resembles that meaning. Sima’s interpretation of *luo* as bridling is incorrect. Below, the text continues with *ji* and *zhi*, only then speaking of bridling. ◎Jia Shifu says: Sima says *ke* means to pare the hooves; *luo* means to bridle the head. This equates *luo* with *luò* (络). It is likely that the first four actions pertain solely to the horse’s body, while the following *ji*, *zhi*, *zao*, and *zhan* address the matter of bits and reins. *Luo* should be *lao* (烙), referring to the branding iron. Du Fu’s poem mentions "carefully examining the six seals bearing the official mark"—*liu yin* (六印) also refers to branding. *Ke* means to chisel the hooves; *luo* means to brand. Searing and shearing regulate the coat; paring and branding preserve external marks. To interpret it as *luò* (络) is mistaken. ◎Yu Yue says: Sima Biao explains *luo zhi* as bridling the head, taking *luo* as a loan for *luò* (络). Yet the text below continues with *ji* and *zhi*, only then addressing bridling—this is likely incorrect. *Luo* should be *lao* (烙). The newly appended *lao* in the *Shuowen*’s *huo* (火) section means "to scorch." Today, official horses are branded on the skin and hair for identification—this is the practice. *Ji*: *jūyí* reflex. *Guangya* says: a rein. *Zhi*: *dīngyì* reflex, Xu: *dīnglì* reflex, meaning to hobble. Li’s pronunciation: *shù*. Some editions write *zhù* (馵), which is incorrect. *Zhù*: *zhīshù* reflex. Sima, Xiang, and Cui’s editions all write *zhi*. Xiang says: Ma’s pronunciation: *sǒng*. Cui says: to hobble the front two legs. ◎Lu Wenchang says: The old edition lacked the pronunciation mark; according to convention, it should be included, so I have added it. *Bian zhi*: *bìrán* reflex. *Zao*: *cáilǎo* reflex, meaning a stable. Another says: a trough. Cui says: a horse pen. *Zhan*: *tǔbǎn* reflex, Xu: *zàijiǎn* reflex, also *shìjiàn* reflex. Woven wood forming a bed is called *zhan*, placed beneath the horse’s feet to dispel dampness—what is called a "horse bed." Cui says: a wooden fence. ◎Lu Wenchang says: *Líng* (灵) is *líng* (棂). *Shī* (湿) should be *shī* (湿); later generations often conflate the two. *Péng* (棚) likely should be *zhà* (栅). ◎Qingfan’s note: *Wenxuan*’s commentary on Yan Yanzhi’s *Zhe Bai Ma Fu* and Pan Anren’s *Ma Qian Du Lei* cites Sima: *zao* means a stable; *zhan* is like a lattice bed, placed on damp ground. *Shiwen* omits this. *Bu zhi*: *zhílì* reflex.

**[4] [Commentary]**
The skilled charioteer seeks to fully realize the horse’s abilities. To realize its abilities lies in entrusting it to its own nature, yet some drive it to gallop and race, demanding performance beyond its capacity—thus many fail and perish. If one instead employs the strength of both swift and slow horses according to their natural limits, though their tracks may span the farthest reaches of the eight wilds, the nature of all horses remains intact.

Yet the deluded, hearing of entrusting horses to their nature, claim one should release them and never ride; hearing of the wind of *wuwei* (non-action), they say walking is inferior to lying down. How far they stray, never to return! This utterly misses the profound intent of Master Zhuang.

**[Exegesis]**
*Jué* (橛) is the bit, referring to precious ornaments adorning the *biāo* (镳, bit rings). A whip with leather is called *biān* (鞭), without leather it is *cè* (策), both being horse prods. When galloping exceeds limits, hunger and thirst disrupt routine, and one restrains with the *héng’è* (衡扼, crossbar and halter), aligns with the *biāopèi* (镳辔, bit and reins), and intimidates with whip and prod—yet demanding abilities beyond their nature. Thus, even mediocre horses cannot endure, and most perish.

The sage’s governance of things suffers the same harm.

**[Philological Notes]**
*《骤》* (gallop): *shì jiù* reflex.
*《橛》*: Xiang Xu: *qí yuè* reflex. Sima: the bit. Cui: the *biāo* (bit rings).
*《饰》*: Xu: *shì* reflex. Sima: the *pái xián* (排衔, bit plate), meaning adornments added to the horse’s bit.
◎Qingfan’s note: *Wenxuan*’s commentary on Pan Anren’s *Xi Zheng Fu* cites Sima: *jué* is the long bit in a horse’s mouth. This differs from the *Shiwen*. ◎Another note: *Jué* is also written as *jué*. *Shuowen* under *zōu* (齺) states: *Zōu* is the bit in a horse’s mouth. *Shiji Suoyin* cites *Zhou Yu Fu Zhi*: "The upward-curving hook is the *jué*; the *jué* lies within the bit, made of iron, as large as a chicken’s egg." *Hanshu*’s *Sima Xiangru Zhuan*, Zhang Yi’s note: "The *xián* (衔) is the bit in a horse’s bridle. The *jué* is the long bit in a horse’s mouth." *Hanzi*’s *Jian Jie Shi Chen Pian*: "Without the threat of the whip or the restraint of bit and *jué*, even Zaofu could not tame a horse." *Yantielun*’s *Xing De Pian*: "It is like driving a stubborn horse without bit or *jué*." Thus, both *xián* and *jué* serve to control the horse.
*《鞭》*: *bì rán* reflex.
*《策》*: *chū gé* reflex. Du’s commentary on the *Zuozhuan*: the horse prod. *Zhuā* (檛) is pronounced *zhú guā* reflex.

**[5] [Exegesis]**
"Fàn tǔ" (范土) means "to mold clay." *Táo* (陶) means "transformation," also "to mold." *Zhí* (埴) means "sticky," also "clay." The potter skillfully blends water and earth to craft vessels, shaping squares and circles to perfectly match the compass and square.

**[Philological Notes]**
*《陶》*: *dào dāo* reflex, meaning "to mold."
*《埴》*: Xu: *shí lì* reflex. Cui: clay. Sima: *zhí* clay can be made into pottery. *Shangshu Zhuan*: "Sticky earth is called *zhí*." *Shiming*: "*Zhí* means *zhāng* (膱, sticky)." *Zhāng* is pronounced *zhī shí* reflex.
*《中规》*: *dīng zhòng* reflex. The same below.

**[6] [Exegesis]**
The hook measures curves; the plumb line measures straightness. The skilled carpenter works wood, ensuring its curves and straightness conform to hook and line.

**[Philological Notes]**
*《应绳》*: "Responds to the line," with *yìng* as in "response." Omitted pronunciations below follow this pattern.

**[7] [Exegesis]**
The nature of earth and wood is endowed by the Creator—without seeking curves or straightness, how could they aspire to squares or circles? Yet potters and carpenters recklessly judge them good or bad.

**[8] [Commentary]**
The world deems those who entrust things to their nature without artifice as unskilled in governance. Bending the crooked into straightness, training inferior horses to mimic the swift, forcing them into the compass and square to correct their nature until death—this is called "good governance." Is this not excessive?

**[Exegesis]**
This summarizes the preceding analogy. Yet the world’s foolishness leads it to mistake governance for goodness and non-governance for deceit—no deceit could be greater.

**[Emendations]**
(1) The character *shì* (士) is amended to *tǔ* (土) following the *Shide Tang* edition and the original *Shiwen*.
(2) The *Shide Tang* edition has *huò* (或) for *huò* (惑). My view: the true way to govern the world is not like this.

People possess an inherent nature: they weave to clothe themselves, till to feed themselves—this is called "shared virtue." Unified yet impartial, it is called "Heaven’s release."

Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their movements are steady, their gazes tranquil. In that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. The myriad things thrived in their native places; birds and beasts gathered in flocks, grasses and trees grew freely. Thus, one could leash and wander among beasts, or climb to peer into the nests of magpies.

**[Commentary]**
To govern through non-governance—this is true governance.

**[Exegesis]**
"Thus" refers to the preceding. The world’s foolishness mistakes governance for goodness and non-governance for deceit—no deceit could be greater.

Zhuangzi said: "In my view, those who excel at governing the world are no match for the potters and weavers of old. The art of good governance is expounded below."

**[Commentary]**
The people’s virtue differs in small ways but shares a common foundation. Thus, what cannot be abandoned in their nature is clothing and food; what cannot be discarded in their affairs is plowing and weaving—these are what the world universally shares and takes as its root. To abide by this Dao is the perfection of non-action.

**[Exegesis]**
Those people are the black-haired masses. It speaks of how all living beings possess an inherent, constant nature that does not depend on external things. *De* (virtue/power) means "to attain." Following their constant nature, each thing is self-sufficient—hence "shared virtue." Guo Xiang said: "What cannot be abandoned in their nature is clothing and food; what cannot be discarded in their affairs is plowing and weaving—these are what the world universally shares and takes as its root. To abide by this Dao is the perfection of non-action."

**[Textual Note]**
*Qu zhe* (去者): Pronounced *qianglü fan*.

**[Commentary]**
To let things be is to unify them of themselves—this is not partiality, hence it is called "Heaven’s release."

**[Exegesis]**
*Dang* (党) means "partial." *Ming* (命) means "to name." *Tian* (天) means "nature." The empty, unobstructed Dao nurtures and sustains all things, raising and nourishing them without partiality. If one governs with an intentional mind, it violates their natural state; but if one simply releases and entrusts them to their own course, all things become self-sufficient—hence it is named "Heaven’s release."

*Tian fang* (天放): Read as written. Cui’s version has *mu* (牧), glossed as "to nurture."

**[Commentary]**
This describes their self-sufficiency within, a state without seeking or reaching beyond.

**[Exegesis]**
*Tian tian* (填填) expresses a heart of contentment. *Dian dian* (颠颠) describes a bearing of lofty uprightness. In the age of utmost purity and harmony, the era of perfect primordial virtue, the mind has already cast off right and wrong, and conduct forgets self and others. Thus, guarding their true nature within, they abide in non-action with a heart full and content; without seeking externally, they wander in emptiness and tranquility with a bearing lofty and upright.

**[Textual Note]**
*Tian tian* (填填): Xu pronounces as *tian*, also read as *tu yan* (徒偃反). A manner of steadfast gravity. Cui glosses as "heavy and slow." Another says: "the appearance of deliberation." The *Huainanzi* writes it as *momo* (莫莫).
*Dian dian* (颠颠): Pronounced *ding tian* (丁田反). Cui glosses as "single-minded." The *Huainanzi* writes it as *mingming* (瞑瞑).

**[Section Five]**
**[Commentary]**
Not seeking gains beyond rightful expectation, they rest content within their own households.

**[Exegesis]**
*Xi* (蹊) means "path"; *sui* (隧), "way." *Zhou* (舟) is "boat." At this time, it was the era of utmost virtue. People knew to keep to their allotted share, and all things were pure and simple. Without plundering or seizing, paths and roads could be abandoned; with no coming or going, boats and bridges fell into disuse.

**[Textual Note]**
*Xi* (蹊): Xu pronounces as *xi* (兮). Li glosses as "path."
*Sui* (隧): Xu pronounces as *sui* (遂). Cui glosses as "way."

**[Section Six]**
**[Commentary]**
In the primal vastness, all things attain their due together—thus they share the world in tranquil indifference. How could nations differ or households diverge?

**[Exegesis]**
In that primal vastness, all was pure harmony and tranquil indifference. Thus, the myriad things, devoid of feeling, adjoined one another in shared hamlets; sentient beings, bound by kinship, dwelt together in common villages and districts. How could nations differ in governance or households diverge in custom?

**[Textual Note]**
*Lian shu qi xiang* (连属其乡): Wang glosses: "With no distinction between nations or divergence among households, their villages adjoined."
*Hun* (混): Pronounced *hu ben* (胡本反).
*Mang* (茫): Pronounced *mo gang* (莫刚反).
*Dan* (淡): Pronounced *tu zan* (徒暂反).
*Mo* (漠): Pronounced *mo* (莫).

**[Section Seven]**
**[Commentary]**
Abiding in the sufficiency of their nature, without desire to annex or conquer, all things remained whole.

**[Exegesis]**
Flying birds and running beasts went unharmed, thus thriving in flocks; herbs, grasses, fruits, and trees were left uncut, flourishing in luxuriant growth.

**[Textual Note]**
*Sui zhang* (遂长): Pronounced *ding zhang* (丁丈反), also read as *zhi liang* (直良反).
*Wu tun* (无吞): Pronounced *dun en* (敦恩反), also read as *tian* (天).

**[Section Eight]**
**[Commentary]**
Harmonizing with things without harming them, all creatures grew docile.

**[Exegesis]**
With no intent to harm other beings, other beings harbored no fear of humans. Thus, mountain fowl and wild beasts could be tethered and led to roam; the nests of birds and magpies could be climbed and peered into.

**[Textual Note]**
*Pan* (攀): Also written as *ban* (扳), pronounced *pu ban* (普班反).
*Yuan* (援): Pronounced *yuan* (袁). The *Guangya* glosses as "to pull, to draw."
*Kui* (窥): Pronounced *qu gui* (去规反).
*Wu xun* (物驯): Pronounced *si zun* (似遵反), or *chun* (纯).

In the era of utmost virtue, humans dwelt alongside birds and beasts, their kindred mingling with the myriad things. How then could one distinguish between the noble and the base?
Alike in non-knowing, their virtue remained unsevered;
Alike in non-desire, they were called plain and uncarved.
In plainness and uncarving, the people’s nature was preserved.

Yet when it came to the sages,
They strained and stumbled for benevolence, stretched and strained for righteousness—thus the world first grew doubtful;
They indulged in extravagance for music, contrived in minutiae for ritual—thus the world first became divided.
For if the uncarved block were not hewn, who would fashion sacrificial goblets?
If white jade were not shattered, who would shape ritual tablets?
If the Dao and its virtue were not abandoned, why would one grasp at benevolence and righteousness?
If nature and feeling were not estranged, why would one employ ritual and music?
If the five colors were not confused, who would devise patterned adornments?
If the five tones were not disordered, who would conform to the six pitch-pipes?
To hew the uncarved into vessels is the fault of the craftsman;
To destroy the Dao and its virtue for benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage.

**[Section One]**
**[Exegesis]**
Those who pursue perverse ends are the base; those who tread the upright Way are the noble. Yet in that time, they dwelt in nests and caves, indistinguishable from birds and beasts; they fed at leisure, drumming their bellies, mingling with creatures without distinction. How then could one know the noble? How could one discern the base?

**[Textual Note]**
*Wu hu* (恶乎): Pronounced *wu* (乌).

**[Section Two]**
**[Commentary]**
Knowing severs one from the Dao by striving for goodness.

**[Exegesis]**
Devoid of discriminating minds, they were alike in non-knowing. Without employing treacherous virtue to seek conduct, they embraced the One and did not stray.

**[Textual Note]**
*Bu li* (不离): Pronounced *li zhi* (力智反). The same in the commentary.

**[Section Three]**
**[Commentary]**
Desire severs one from nature by embellishment.

**[Exegesis]**
Alike in the desirelessness of the primal age, each thing remained pure and incorrupt; unlike the decadence of later times, all people were plain and uncarved.

**[Textual Note]**
*Su po* (素朴): Pronounced *pu bo* (普剥反).

**[Section Four]**
**[Commentary]**
No vexation from knowing or desiring.

**[Exegesis]**
The reason the people lost their nature was their entanglement in desire. Yet in desirelessness and plainness, their true nature remained unsullied—hence it is said to be "preserved." This line summarizes the excellence of the era of utmost virtue.

**[Section Five]**
**[Commentary]**
The sage is but the trace of the people’s attainment of their nature, not the source of that trace. Here, "when it came to the sages" means "when it came to their traces."

**[Section Six]**
**[Commentary]**
Once the traces of the sages became manifest, benevolence and righteousness were no longer genuine, and ritual and music estranged one from nature, merely attaining outward form. With the advent of sages came these ills—what then am I to do?

**[Exegesis]**
The preceding sections extol the virtue of plainness and simplicity; the following sections censure the errors of the sages’ traces. "When it came to the sages" refers to those who enacted the sages’ traces from the Five Emperors onward. *Bie xie* (蹩躠) describes the appearance of exertion; *di qi* (踶跂), the bearing of self-importance. *Chan man* (澶漫) denotes a heart of indulgence; *zhai pi* (摘僻), conduct of contortion. As the plain and simple Dao waned, artifice and falsity arose. Striving for righteousness through self-importance, straining for benevolence through partiality, prizing extravagance in music, and exalting ostentation in ritual—thus the world became divided, the people grew doubtful, the warp of Heaven was disrupted, and all began from this.

**[Textual Note]**
*Bie* (蹩): Pronounced *bu jie* (步结反).

The *Xiang Cui* edition reads *bì* (弊), homophonous. *Xie* (躠): In another edition, written as *xuē* (薛), pronounced *xī jié* (悉结反). The *Xiang Cui* edition reads *shā* (杀), homophonous. Another pronunciation: *sù gě* (素葛反). *Dì* (踶): Pronounced *zhí shì* (直氏反); *Xiang* and *Cui* editions identical; *Cui* edition also reads *tí* (缇). *Qí* (跂): Pronounced *qiū shì* (丘氏反); another pronunciation: *lǚ shì* (吕氏反); *Cui* edition reads *jì* (技). Li [Yun] says: *Bié xiè dì qí* (蹩躠踶跂) all describe the appearance of applying the mind to benevolence and righteousness.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Dì* (踶) lacks glosses in all editions. *Shuowen* states: *Dì* (踶) means *wèi* (躗). *Wèi* (躗) means *dì* (踶) (variant form). (Duan Yucai’s commentary: The old edition erroneously writes *wèi* (卫); now corrected according to the *dì* (踶) entry and the *niú* (牛) section’s *chì* (□) entry.)

*Chán* (澶): In another edition, written as *chán* (儃), pronounced *tú dàn* (徒旦反), or *tǔ dàn* (吐旦反). The *Xiang Cui* edition reads *dàn* (但), pronounced *chǎn* (燀). *Màn* (漫): Pronounced *wǔ bàn* (武半反). The *Xiang Cui* edition reads *màn* (曼), homophonous. Li [Yun] says: *Chán màn* (澶漫) means "indulgent and unrestrained." Cui [Zhuan] says: *Dàn màn* (但曼) means "excessive and overflowing." Another interpretation: *Chán màn* (澶漫) means "dragging and pulling." *Zhāi* (摘): Pronounced *chì lì* (敕历反), or *shè gé* (涉革反). *Pì* (辟): Pronounced *pǐ bì* (匹壁反); *Xiang* edition reads *bò* (檗); *Xu* reads *fū lì* (敷历反); Li [Yun] reads *fù lì* (父历反). In another edition, written as *pì* (僻), homophonous. Li [Yun] says: It means "to correct and expose depravity and contortion to establish ritual." Another pronunciation: *fù chì* (妇赤反), meaning "law." Cui [Zhuan] says: *Tī pì* (擿辟) means "excessive ornamentation."

◎ Lu Wenchang says: The current text reads *pì* (僻).
◎ Jia Shifu says: *Shiwen* cites Li [Yun] as saying, "to correct and expose depravity and contortion to establish ritual," and Cui [Zhuan] as saying, "*tī pì* (擿辟) means 'excessive ornamentation.'" *Tī pì* (擿辟) should be written as *zhāi pǐ* (摘擗). Wang Yi’s commentary on the *Chuci* states: *Pǐ* (擗) means "to split." *Zhāi* (摘) means "to select"; *pǐ* (擗) means "to divide"—referring to its over-elaboration and fragmentation.

*Shǐ fēn* (始分): Read as written. All subsequent instances of *fēn* (分) follow the same pronunciation.

[7] **Exegesis:** *Chún pǔ* (纯朴) means "whole wood," uncarved and unblemished. *Shú* (孰) means "who." *Xī zūn* (牺尊) is a wine vessel, carved with an ox’s head, used in ancestral temple sacrifices. A scepter with a pointed top and square base is called a *guī* (珪); half a *guī* is called a *zhāng* (璋). This briefly employs metaphors to illustrate the governance of an age marked by frivolous contention.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Xī zūn* (牺尊): Pronounced *xī*. *Zūn* may also be written as *zūn* (樽). Sima [Biao] says: "It is adorned with painted images of sacrificial oxen." Wang Su says: "Carved into the shape of an ox’s head." Zheng Xuan says: "The vessel is decorated with painted phoenix feathers, shimmering in a dancing manner." Pronounced *xiān hé* (先河) in reverse.

◎ Lu Wenchang says: The current text reads *zūn* (樽), a common variant.

*Guī zhāng* (珪璋): Pronounced *zhāng*. Li [Yun] says: "Both are names of ritual implements. A scepter with a pointed top and square base is called a *guī*; half a *guī* is called a *zhāng*."

[8] **Exegesis:** This synthesizes the metaphors. In the age of the Great Dao, right and wrong are not distinguished; in the time of utmost virtue, neither hatred nor love is debated.

Without love, human hearts naturally settle; without wrong, root and trace are forgotten. Thus, the *Laozi* states: "When the Great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness."

[9] **Exegesis:** Ritual restrains traces; music harmonizes the heart. If emotions do not dissipate, why harmonize the heart? If nature does not depart, why restrain traces? Thus, the harmonizing of hearts and restraining of traces arise from the loss of the Dao.

**Annotation:** *Qíng xìng bù lí* (情性不离): Read as written. Also means "separation."

◎ Lu Wenchang says: The current text reads *xìng qíng* (性情) instead of *qíng xìng* (情性).

[10] **Commentary:** All these transform simplicity into ornament, forsake the root to exalt the branch, and thus damage the pristine nature of heaven. Though the world values them, it does not value what is true.

**Exegesis:** Ornamentation inherently arises from contrast; music is prized for harmony. If each color and sound remains isolated, without mutual enhancement, then palace and commerce, *fǔ* and *fú*, cannot serve their purpose. This reiterates the metaphor to confirm the earlier meaning.

[11] **Commentary:** Craftsmen have the regulations of compass and square; sages have the traces they esteem.

**Exegesis:** This summarizes the preceding argument. Craftsmen, with vessels like the *xī zūn*, mar the root of unadorned simplicity; sages, with the traces of benevolence and righteousness, destroy the Dao of non-action. Since the harm is the same, their guilt should be equal.

**Collation:**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition omits *yǐ* (矣) and the initial *fú* (夫) in the commentary.
(2) The character *wèi* (躗) is deleted following the *Shuowen*.
(3) The *Shide Tang* edition reads *zūn* (樽); this text follows the *Shiwen* in emending to *zūn* (尊).

Horses, when dwelling on land, eat grass and drink water. When pleased, they rub necks together; when angered, they turn their backs and kick. This is all horses know.

When fitted with yokes and frontlets, horses learn to jostle, resist restraints, rear, bite bits, and steal reins. Thus, that horses’ knowledge and behavior descend into thievery is the fault of Bo Le.

[1] **Commentary:** If one guides their true knowledge and rides their natural state, then a journey of ten thousand *li* may be achieved without losing the nature of the herd.

**Exegesis:** *Mǐ* (靡) means "to rub" or "to follow." *Dì* (踶) means "to trample." *Yǐ* (已) means "to cease." The joy and anger of creatures are endowed by heaven; they move according to their nature, not through artifice. Thus, when pleased, they rub necks in harmony; when angered, they turn their backs and kick. Horses’ understanding extends no further than this—eating grass, drinking water, and finding joy therein.

**Annotation:**
*Jiāo jǐng* (交颈): *Jǐng* means "neck." Pronounced *jū yǐng* (居郢) or *qí yíng* (祁盈).
*Xiāng mǐ* (相靡): Read as written. Li [Yun] says: "To rub." Another gloss: "To love."
◎ Qing Fan notes: *Mǐ* (靡) was anciently read as *mó* (摩), hence interchangeable. (See *Tang Yun Zheng*.) The *Hanshu* (*Biography of the Princes of Huainan and Hengshan*) states: "Their customs were shallow, and their ministers gradually *mó* (靡) made it so." *Jiàn mǐ* (渐靡) is *jiàn mó* (渐摩). The *Xunzi* (*On the Nature of Evil*) states: "That one daily advances in benevolence and righteousness without self-awareness is due to *mǐ* (靡) making it so." *Mǐ* (靡) is *mó* (摩). (The *Liji* (*Record of Learning*) states: "Observing one another and improving is called *mó* (摩)." Zheng [Xuan]’s commentary: "*Mó* (摩) means mutual polishing.") The *Zuozhuan* (*Duke Cheng*, Year 2) states: "The army reached below *Mí* (靡) Mountain." *Mí* (靡) is pronounced *mó* (摩). The *Shiji* (*Biography of Su Qin*) states: "To bring forth and *chuǎi mó* (揣摩)." The Zou edition reads *chuǎi mǐ* (揣靡). *Mǐ* (靡) is read as *mó* (摩). Yuan Daitong’s *Liushu Gu*: "*Mǐ* (靡) and *mó* (摩) are interchangeable." Throughout this text, "when close, they *mǐ* (靡) one another in trust" is also read as *mó* (摩).
*Xiāng dì* (相踶): Pronounced *dà jì* (大计), *tú xī* (徒兮), or *tú qí* (徒祁). Li [Yun] says: "*Dì* (踶) means to trample." The *Guangya*, *Ziyun*, and *Shenglei* concur. The *Tongsu Wen* states: "A small trample is called *dì* (踶)."
*Mǎ zhī* (马知): Li [Yun] pronounces *zhī* (知) as *zhì* (智). The same below.

[Section 2] [Commentary by the Shu brothers]
*Héng* (衡) is the crossbar at the front of the carriage shaft. *È* (扼) is the neck yoke for the horse. *Yuètí* (月题) are the crescent-shaped ornaments placed on the horse’s forehead, aligned with the skull. *Jiè* (介) means solitary. *Ní* (倪) is *pìnì* (睥睨), a sidelong glare. *Yīn* (闉) means curved. *Zhì* (鸷) means to resist. *Màn* (曼) means to charge. *Guǐ* (诡) means deceit. *Qiè* (窃) means theft.

The horse’s true *zhì* (知) lies only in delighting in freedom and wildness; it does not seek adornment, nor does it crave glory and splendor. Yet when *yuètí* are affixed, and it is constrained by *héng* and *è*, this violates its natural disposition, leaving it unable to endure hardship. Thus, deceit and cunning arise: it glares sidelong, twists its head against the curved yoke, resists, and charges at its handler. It steals the reins to slip free of the bridle, or spits out the bit in deceit. All this stems from the violation of its true nature, giving rise to a hundred forms of falsity.

[Phonetic and Exegetical Notes]
*Héng’è* (衡扼): Pronounced *yú gé* (于革) [reflex]. *Héng* is the crossbar at the front of the shaft to which the yoke is bound. *È* is the neck yoke for the horse.
*Yuètí* (月题): Pronounced *tú xī* (徒兮) [reflex]. Sima Cui states: "The crescent-shaped ornament on the horse’s forehead, aligned with the skull."
*Jiè* (介): Xu [Yun] pronounces it *gǔ bā* (古八) [reflex].
*Ní* (倪): Xu [Yun] pronounces it *wǔ guī* (五圭) [reflex]; Guo [Pu] pronounces it *wǔ dì* (五第) [reflex]. Li [Yun] states: "*Jièní* (介倪) is like *pìnì* (睥睨)." Cui [Yun] states: "*Jiè* means to stand out, *ní* means to glare."
*Yīn* (闉): Pronounced *yīn* (因).
*Zhì* (鸷): Xu [Yun] pronounces it *chì èr* (敕二) [reflex]; Guo [Pu] pronounces it *zhì* (踬).
*Màn* (曼): Pronounced *wǔ bàn* (武半) [reflex] by Xu [Yun]; *wǔ jiàn* (武谏) [reflex] by Guo [Pu]. Li [Yun] states: "*Yīn* means curved; *zhì* means to resist; *màn* means to charge." Cui [Yun] states: "*Yīn’è zhì màn* (闉扼鸷曼) means to resist the yoke with a curved neck, charging and slowing." Sima [Biao] states: "It means to curve its neck against the yoke and charge." Another note states: "*Zhì màn* (鸷曼) means to swerve aside."
◎ Jia Shifu remarks: The *Shiwen* cites Li [Yun] as saying: "*Jièní* (介倪) is like *pìnì* (睥睨); *yīn* (闉) means curved; *zhì* (鸷) means to resist."

"Màn" means to charge. Cui [Yun] states: "*Yīn’è zhì màn* (闉扼鸷曼) means to resist the yoke and slow down." Sima [Biao] states: "It means to curve its neck against the yoke and charge." Another note states: "*Zhì màn* (鸷曼) means to swerve aside."

Now, examining the *Zuozhuan* of Duke Cheng’s second year: "They did not *jiè* the horses before driving them." Du Yu annotates: "*Jiè* refers to horse armor." The *Shuowen* states: "*Bǐ* (俾) means to benefit." *Ní* (倪) means *bǐ* (俾). This suggests the horse is aware of the armor upon its body. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Hereditary House of Jin*, states: "The horse was *zhì* and could not move." The *Shuowen* states: "*Zhì* describes a horse’s heavy appearance." *Yīn’è* (闉扼) is akin to being constrained; *zhì màn* (鸷曼) is akin to sluggishness and heaviness. This describes a horse burdened by armor, its qi obstructed and movement hindered, risking a snapped bit or severed reins. Li [Yun]’s interpretation of *pìnì* (睥睨) is mistaken.

*Guǐ* (诡): Pronounced *jiǔ bǐ* (九彼) [reflex].
*Xián* (衔): The bit in the horse’s mouth. Some say: "*Guǐxián* (诡衔) means to spit out the bit."
*Qièpèi* (窃辔): To gnaw the reins. Cui [Yun] states: "*Guǐxián qièpèi* (诡衔窃辔) means to reject the bit and gnaw the reins; *lìxián jué* (戾衔橛) means to twist the bit and chew the bridle; *dào gēnpèi* (盗鞎辔) means to steal the reins."

◎ Lu Wenchang remarks: The old text mistakenly wrote *gēn* (鞎) as *jiān* (艰); this has now been corrected.
The *Shuowen* states: The leather at the front of a chariot is called *gēn* (鞎).

【3】【Commentary】Though horses differ in nature, they are uniformly pressed into service, hence some exhaust their strength while feigning compliance.

【Exegesis】*Tài* (态) means deceit. A horse’s true nature thrives in the wild; when overdriven, its cunning arises, and the deceptions of *guǐxián qièpèi* (诡衔窃辔) are laid at the feet of Bole.

【Phonetic Gloss】*Tàizuò* (态作): Pronounced *tǔ dài* (吐代) [reflex].
【Collation】(1) The character *rán* (然) is amended following Wang Shumin’s proposal.

In the age of Heshu, people dwelt without purpose, wandered without destination, played with food in their mouths, and roamed with bellies full—such was the people’s true capacity.

Yet when the sages came, bending and shaping rites and music to correct the world’s form, dangling benevolence and righteousness to soothe the world’s heart, the people then began to prance and strain, to prize cunning and vie for profit, unable to stop. This, too, was the sages’ fault.

【1】【Commentary】This was the people’s true capacity.
【Exegesis】*Zhī* (之) means "to go." Heshu was an ancient sovereign; alternatively, he possessed a radiant virtue that drew the people to him, hence "Heshu"—likely the Flame Emperor. In that era of the Dao, the age of non-action, hearts were free of entanglement, dwelling in ease without striving. Moving by nature’s impulse, roaming without fixed path, they played with food in their mouths like infants, roamed with full bellies like children—no distinction. Such was the age of perfect simplicity, the people’s true capacity.

【Phonetic Gloss】*Hè* (赫): Some versions write *xū* (), pronounced *hū bái* (呼白) [reflex].
*Hèshūshì* (赫胥氏): Sima [Biao] says: Heshu was an ancient sovereign. Another opinion: he possessed a radiant virtue that drew the people to him, hence "Heshu"—likely the Flame Emperor.
◎ Yu Yue remarks: Sima’s gloss—"Heshu, an ancient sovereign"—is most apt. The alternative—"he possessed a radiant virtue that drew the people to him, hence 'Heshu,' likely the Flame Emperor"—is mere conjecture from the form of the characters, wholly unreliable. The Flame Emperor was Shennong. The *Qūqiè* chapter mentions both Heshu and Shennong, proving they were not the same. Heshu may be the Huaxu of the *Liezi*. *Huá* (华) and *hè* (赫) are phonetic alternates. The *Guangya* defines *hè* (赫) as "red," and many ancients named "red" used the cognate *huá* (华): Yangshe Chi was styled Bohua, Gongxi Chi was styled Zihua. Thus *huá* (华) also means "red." That "red" is called *hè* (赫) and also *huá* (华) confirms that Heshu is Huaxu.
*Hánbǔ* (含哺): Pronounced *yīn bù* (音步) [reflex].

【2】【Commentary】Their fault lay in exalting traces.
【Exegesis】Bending and twisting, performing rites and music to correct the body; dangling benevolence and righteousness to entice the heart, they caused the people to prance in self-importance, to prize cunning and spawn deceit, to scheme for profit and vie without cease. Alas! The fault of the sages’ traces.
【Phonetic Gloss】*Xuànqǐ* (县企): Pronounced *xuán qǐ* (音玄).
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern editions write *qǐ* (跂).
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Wenxuan* commentary on Fu Changyu’s poem "Zeng He Shao Wang Ji" cites Sima [Biao]: *qǐ* (企) means "to gaze." The *Shiwen* omits this.
*Dì* (踶): Pronounced *zhí shì* (直氏) [reflex].
*Qǐ* (跂): Pronounced *qiū shì* (丘氏) [reflex].
*Hàozhì* (好知): Pronounced *hū bào* (呼报) [reflex], *zhì* (智) below.

External Chapters: *Qūqiè* (胠箧) Ten
【1】【Phonetic Gloss】The chapter title is taken from its opening phrase.

To guard against thieves who pry open chests, rifle bags, and break into coffers, one must bind cords tightly, fasten bolts securely—this is what the world calls wisdom.

Yet when the great thief comes, he shoulders the coffer, hoists the chest, slings the bag, and flees, fearing only that the cords, bolts, and locks are not secure enough. Then what the world once called wisdom is revealed as merely stockpiling for the great thief.

【1】【Exegesis】*Qū* (胠) means "to open"; *qiè* (箧) means "box."

"Pouch" refers to a bag; *shè* (摄) means "to gather"; *jiān* (缄) means "to bind"; *téng* (縢) means "rope." *Jiōng* (扃) refers to a latch; *jué* (鐍) refers to a lock and key. Now, those who pry open chests, rifle pouches, and break into coffers to seize wealth are but petty thieves, not great ones. If one wishes to guard against them, what method should be used? One must gather and secure the chests and pouches, bind and fasten the ropes, and firmly latch and lock them to prevent careless concealment. This is the shallow wisdom of the common world.

【Phonetic Gloss】*Qū* (胠): Li reads *qǐ jū fǎn* (起居反). The *Records of the Grand Historian* writes it as *lā* (搚). Xu reads *qǐ fǎ fǎn* (起法反), with another pronunciation as *xū fá fǎn* (虚乏反). Sima states: "To open from the side is *qū* (胠)." Another says: "To open is *qū* (胠)." *Qiè* (箧): Read *kǔ xié fǎn* (苦协反). *Tàn* (探): Read *tǔ nán fǎn* (吐南反). *Náng* (囊): Read *nǎi gāng fǎn* (乃刚反). *Guì* (匮): Read *qí wèi fǎn* (其位反), meaning "coffer." *Bì shè* (必摄): Read as written. Li says: "To bind." Cui says: "To gather." *Jiān* (缄): Read *gǔ jiǎn fǎn* (古减反). *Téng* (縢): Xiang and Cui’s versions write it identically. Read *tú dēng fǎn* (徒登反). Cui says: "To fasten." According to the *Guangya*: "Both *jiān* (缄) and *téng* (縢) refer to rope." *Jiōng* (扃): Read *gǔ yíng fǎn* (古荧反). Cui and Li say: "To latch." *Jué* (鐍): Read *gǔ xué fǎn* (古穴反). Li says: "A bolt." Cui says: "A ring and tongue." *Zhī yě* (知也): Read as written, also pronounced *zhì* (智). The same applies below.

【2】【Annotation】Thus is the insufficiency of such wisdom.

【Exegesis】To gather, bind, fasten, and latch is to guard against petty thieves. Yet when the great thief arrives, he shoulders the coffer, hoists the chest, and flees, fearing only that the ropes, latches, and locks are not secure enough. The former precautions thus become provisions for the thief, proving that common wisdom is not to be relied upon.

Thus, let us attempt to discuss this: among those whom the world deems wise, are there any who do not accumulate for the great thief? Among those deemed sagely, are there any who do not guard for the great thief?

How do we know this is so? In ancient times, the neighboring towns of the state of Qi were within sight of one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs audible to each other. The nets and snares were spread, and the plows and hoes pierced the earth across more than two thousand *li*. Within the bounds of its four borders, wherever ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, cities, villages, districts, and hamlets were established—was there ever a case where the models of the sages were not followed?

Yet Tian Chengzi, in a single day, slew the ruler of Qi and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also stole the sagely wisdom and laws along with it. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a bandit, yet lived in the security of Yao and Shun; small states dared not condemn him, and great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held the state of Qi. Was this not because he had not only stolen the state of Qi but also its sagely wisdom and laws to guard his bandit’s person?

**Annotations:**
1. To elucidate the principle of forgetting words, the text begins with a tentative discussion. It states: the worldly wise, with their shallow schemes, and the manifestly sagely, who have not deeply grasped the Dao, intend to prevent and restrain, yet instead accumulate for thieves; though they seek to govern the world, they end up guarding for bandits. If one claims there are those who do not, it is to show that none fail to accumulate or guard for the great thief—proving that all inevitably do so.
2. This rhetorical question clarifies the argument’s intent.
3. Qi was the land enfeoffed to the descendants of the Grand Duke, where Duke Huan later convened the feudal lords nine times and brought order to the realm. Its people prospered beyond all others in the Three Qi. Thus, the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs could be heard across neighboring towns, whose roofs were visible to one another. Nets and snares were spread for hunting and fishing, while plows and hoes tilled the fields for agriculture. Its territory spanned over two thousand *li*, making it the most flourishing of the feudal states. *Lei* refers to the plow; *nou*, to the hoe.
4. Without earth, man cannot stand; without grain, he cannot eat. Thus, earth-altars were called *she* (社), and grain-altars *ji* (稷). *Ji* is the chief of the five grains, and *she* means "to sprout," for it brings forth all things. According to the *Art of War*: six feet make a *bu*, a hundred *bu* make a *mu*, a hundred *mu* make a *fu*, three *fu* make a *wu*, four *wu* make a *jing*, and four *jing* make a town. It also states: five households make a *bi*, five *bi* make a *lü*, five *lü* make a *zu*, five *zu* make a *dang*, five *dang* make a *zhou*, and five *zhou* make a *xiang*. Zheng Xuan says: twenty-five households make a *lü*, two thousand five hundred a *zhou*, and twelve thousand five hundred a *xiang*. *He* means "to encompass"; *he* (曷) means "how." Within the four borders of the Three Qi, the establishment of ancestral temples and the like all followed the models of the sages from Yao and Shun onward, forming the laws of the state.
5. To "follow the sages" is merely to imitate their traces. Yet traces are things of the past, not tools for responding to change—how can they be worthy of esteem and adherence? Clinging to fixed traces to govern the boundless, when the boundless arrives, the traces become stagnant. This is why one guards the state only to have it guarded by others.
6. Without stealing their sagely laws, he could not have taken the state.
7. Tian Chengzi was Chen Heng, a grandee of Qi and the seventh-generation descendant of Jingzhong. Jingzhong, having fled to Qi, was enfeoffed with fields (*tian*), hence the change to the Tian clan. In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, Chen Heng assassinated his ruler, Duke Jian. He seized territory from Anping to Langye, making it his own fief. His great-grandson, Duke Tai, relocated Duke Kang of Qi to the coast and declared himself Marquis of Qi. From Jingzhong to Duke Zhuang, nine generations held power in Qi; from Duke Tai to King Wei, three generations ruled as marquises. In total, this spans twelve generations. Zhuangzi lived in the time of King Xuan, but since Xuan is not counted here, it is called twelve generations.
8. What Tian Heng stole was not merely the state—by first stealing sagely wisdom, he gained the allegiance of the feudal lords. Thus, the traces of benevolence and righteousness serve only as the root of banditry.

The same applies below.

7. The *fu* commentary states: Tian Heng usurped the state of Qi, thus earning the reputation of a great bandit; yet he occupied the rank of feudal lord and enjoyed the peace and prosperity of the Tang and Yu eras.

8. The *fu* commentary states: In a small state of viscounts or barons, none dared to slander him; in a larger state of earls or marquises, who could have launched an attack? Thus, his descendants continued in succession, ancestral temples endured, and the lineage spanned twelve generations—all as explained previously.

The *Shiwen* notes: "Twelve generations held Qi." From Jingzhong to Zhuangzi, nine generations controlled Qi's governance; from Duke Tai to King Wei, three generations ruled as marquises of Qi—hence twelve generations.

Yu Yue remarks: The *Shiwen* states, "From Jingzhong to Zhuangzi, nine generations controlled Qi's governance; from Duke Tai to King Wei, three generations ruled as marquises of Qi—hence twelve generations." This explanation is incorrect. The original text concerns Tian Chengzi and should not trace back to Jingzhong. I suspect the original *Zhuangzi* text read "generation after generation held Qi," meaning that after Tian Chengzi, Qi was held by successive generations. In ancient texts, when a repeated character appears, a mark is placed beneath it to indicate duplication, so it should read "generation [two] held Qi." Scribes mistakenly inverted the characters, rendering it "two generations held Qi." As the text became unintelligible, they traced back from Tian Chengzi to Jingzhong, arriving at twelve generations, and arbitrarily inserted "ten" above it.

9. The *zhu* commentary states: Sagely methods are merely tools for human use and do not suffice as complete instruments for governance.

The *fu* commentary states: Wielding benevolence and righteousness to usurp a state, relying on sagely wisdom to preserve oneself—this reiterates the preceding passage to conclude its meaning.

The *Shiwen* notes: "To guard" is read as written; the old reading is *shou* (as in "hunt").

The *Jiao* (collation) notes: The *Quewu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, where "sage" appears as "sagely wisdom." In the following passages—"the good cannot stand without the Way of the sage," "Robber Zhi could not act without the Way of the sage," "the sage's benefit to the world is slight," "the sage arises and great bandits emerge," "strike down the sage," "the sage is dead," "the sage does not die," "though the sage is revered," "this is the fault of the sage," and "that sage is the world's sharpest tool"—all instances of "sage" are consistent.

Let us examine this: Among those the world calls most wise, are there none who accumulate for great bandits? Among those called most sagely, are there none who guard for great bandits? How do we know this is so?

In ancient times, Guan Longfeng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was pulverized. Thus, though these four were virtuous, they could not escape execution.

Therefore, Robber Zhi's followers asked him, "Does banditry also have a Way?"
Zhi replied, "Where is there no Way? To conjecture the treasures hidden in a room is wisdom; to enter first is courage; to exit last is righteousness; to know what is feasible is knowledge; to divide spoils equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world can become a great bandit."

From this, we see that the good cannot stand without the Way of the sage, and Robber Zhi could not act without the Way of the sage. Since the world's good people are few and the unvirtuous many, the sage's benefit to the world is slight, while his harm is great.

Thus it is said: When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when Lu's wine was weak, Handan was besieged; when the sage arises, great bandits emerge. Strike down the sage, release the bandits, and the world will begin to be ordered.

When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. Once the sage is dead, great bandits will not rise, and the world will be at peace without incident.

1. The *fu* commentary states: This reiterates the preceding meaning to introduce what follows.

2. The *fu* commentary states: This hypothetical question expands the theme.

3. The *zhu* commentary states: Violent and chaotic rulers could wield the authority of rulership to execute worthy men without opposition—all due to sagely methods. Without sagely methods, how could Jie and Zhou have maintained their positions to spread their poison, making the world tremble?

The *fu* commentary states: Guan Longfeng, surnamed Guan, was a worthy minister of Xia Jie, killed by Jie. Bi Gan, a prince, remonstrated with Zhou; Zhou cut out his heart to examine it. Chang Hong was a worthy minister of King Ling of Zhou. The *Shuoyuan* states: When Jin's Shu Xiang killed Chang Hong, Chang Hong repeatedly appeared in Zhou. Pretending to leave a letter, he told Shu Xiang, "Raise Jin's troops to attack Zhou, depose the Liu clan, and establish the Shan clan." The Duke of Liu told the king, "This is Chang Hong." Thus, he was executed. *Chi* means "to tear"; it also means "to disembowel" or "to pulverize." Wu Zixu was executed, his corpse cast into the river to rot. These four men were all loyal and worthy, yet they could not escape execution because lawless rulers, relying on the power of rulership and the authority of sagely traces, could trample loyal ministers and unleash their poison.

The *Shiwen* notes: "Bi Gan was disemboweled" is read *pou* (to cut open). Cui's edition reads *jie* (to dismember). "Chang Hong" is read *Chang* (straight) *liang* (good) *fan*. *Hongchi*: Xu reads *chi* (to tear) as *zhi* (paper) *fan*; Guo reads it as *shi* (poem) *shi* (clan) *fan*. Cui says: read as *tuo* (to drag), or it may be the character *shi* (to spread). *Chi* means "to tear." The *Huainanzi* states: "Chang Hong was torn apart and died." Sima Qian says: *chi* means "to flay."

Chang Hong was a worthy minister of King Ling of Zhou. According to the *Zuozhuan*, he was a grandee of Kings Jing and Jing of Zhou, and in the sixth month of the third year of Duke Ai of Lu, the people of Zhou put Chang Hong to death. Another account states: "to disembowel" is called *chi*. *Zixu mi* is read *mi* (密池反), while Sima reads it as written, explaining it as "to bind." Cui says: "to rot him in the river." According to the account, Zixu was Wu Yun, who remonstrated with Fuchai, but Fuchai did not heed him. He was given the sword *Shulou* to die and was cast into the river.

*Yan de* is read *yu* (于虔反).

**[4]** **[Commentary]** This posits a hypothetical question from the likes of Robber Zhi to open the discussion.

**[Annotation]** *Gu Zhi* is read *zhi* (之石反).

**[5]** **[Commentary]** This answers the preceding question. The Dao is present everywhere—where could one go that is not the Dao? Where the Dao resides is enumerated below.

◎Qing Fan’s note: "Where could one go that would lack the Dao?" should read, "Where could one go that would possess the Dao?" *Shi* (适) is interchangeable with *chi* (啻). (In the *Stratagems of Qin*, "Those who doubt me are not merely three men," *shi* is interchangeable with *chi*. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the "Biography of Gan Mao," reads, "Those who doubt me are not only three men.") Later scholars, not understanding this, mistook it for the *shi* in "to go to Qi, to go to Chu, to go to Qin," and thus erroneously altered it to "lack the Dao." The *Lüshi Chunqiu*, in the "Dangwu" chapter, correctly reads, "Where could one go that would possess the Dao?" (The *Huainanzi*, in the "Daoying" chapter, reads, "Where could one go that would possess the Dao?" The current text reads "lack the Dao," which is also a later, mistaken alteration.)

**[6] [Annotation]** These five qualities serve to prevent theft, yet they instead become the resources of thieves.

**[Commentary]** Within chambers and treasuries, wealth and treasures are stored. When thieves conceive wicked intentions, they measure and assess, determining presence or absence with uncanny precision—this is called *sagacity*. They unite in strength and purpose, unafraid of might, all vying to enter first—is this not *courage*? Amidst the clash of arrows and stones, they disregard their lives, rushing forward while others hold back—is this not *righteousness*? They act when success is possible and desist when it is not, discerning safety from danger and fortune from misfortune, ensuring victory in every venture—this is their *wisdom*. They value righteousness over wealth, take little while yielding much, and distribute goods with equity—this is their *benevolence*. These five qualities are none other than the sagacity, courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence mentioned earlier. To be a single thief, one must rely on all five virtues; without them, theft cannot succeed. Thus, it is known that no one in the world has ever become a great thief without sagacity and wisdom.

**[Philological Notes]**
*《之藏》* read as *cáilàng* (才浪反), or as the common pronunciation.
◎ *Qingfan’s note*: *Yì* (意) means "to assess" and is interchangeable with *yì* (億). The *Liyun* states, "The sage endures, treating the world as one family and the central states as one person," not through mere conjecture. The *Guanzi*, in the "Xiaowen" chapter, says, "The noble person excels in planning, while the petty person excels in guessing," where *yì* (意) means "to assess." The *Hanfeizi*, in the "Jie Lao" chapter, states, "Foreknowledge is to conjecture without basis." (*Note*: *Wàng* (忘) is a clerical variant of *wàng* (妄).) Wang Bao’s *Sizi Jiangde Lun* says, "The noble person holds to precise measures and does not recklessly conjecture." (*Note*: *Wǎng* (罔) carries the meaning of *wàng* (妄).) The *Shaoyi* commentary by Zheng states, "To measure is to assess," where *yì* (意) is also written as *yì* (億). In the *Lunyu*, "Analects: Xianjin," it reads, "His conjectures were often accurate," while the *Hanshu*, "Biography of Merchants," uses *yì* (意).
*《知可》* read as written, or alternatively as "knowing what is permissible or not."
◎ *Lu Wenchao’s note*: The current text includes the character *fǒu* (否).

**[7] [Commentary]** The Way of the sage refers to these five virtues. Viewed through this principle, those who do good do not tread the path of the five virtues and thus have no means to establish themselves or practice the Way. As for the likes of Robber Zhi, without relying on sagacity and wisdom, how could they carry out their thefts?

**[8] [Annotation]** How true these words are! Though these words are true, the world still cannot do without sages, for the knowledge of the world has not yet entirely vanished, and the sagely Way is needed to govern it. If the knowledge of the multitude remains while sagacity alone is lost, the harm to the world would be greater than if sages existed. Thus, though the harm of having sages is great, it is still preferable to the chaos of a world without them. Yet even this is not as good as the complete absence of harm. How extreme it is that the world, though all seek profit, cannot uniformly abandon its knowledge—how deluded and misguided it has become!

**[Commentary]** The paths of good and evil both arise from sagacity and wisdom. Boyi upheld integrity and became renowned, while Robber Zhi indulged in greed and seized profit. Yet the followers of Robber Zhi are many, while those like Boyi are few. Thus, it is known that the traces of sages benefit the world little but harm it greatly.

**[Philological Notes]**
*《无治》* read as *zhílì* (直吏反). The same applies to *shǐzhì* (始治) below.

**[9] [Annotation]** The lips are not chilled to freeze the teeth, yet the teeth grow cold; the wine of Lu was not thin to besiege Handan, yet Handan was besieged; sages are not born to incite great thieves, yet great thieves arise. This is the natural course of mutual generation, an inevitable tendency. Though sages do not establish themselves as models for the world, they cannot prevent the world from exalting them. Thus, regardless of rank or the authenticity of affairs, if one emulates the sagely model, the world will swallow its words and submit in silence—this is precisely what Robber Zhi relied upon to become a great thief.

**[Commentary]** The *Zuozhuan* states, "When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold"—this refers to Yu and Guo. Handan is a city of Zhao. Formerly, King Xuan of Chu convened the feudal lords, and Duke Gong of Lu arrived late with thin wine. Enraged, the king sought to humiliate him.

Duke Gong replied, "I am a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, performing the rites and music of the Son of Heaven, with meritorious service to the House of Zhou. Now, though I have already erred in presenting the wine, to reproach me further for its thinness—is this not excessive?" Thereupon, he departed without taking leave. Enraged, King Xuan raised troops to attack Lu. King Hui of Liang had long wished to strike Zhao but feared Chu’s rescue. Now that Chu and Lu were at odds, Liang seized the opportunity to attack Zhao, and Handan was besieged. This, too, is like sages being born—not that they intend to give rise to great thieves, yet great thieves arise, for circumstances compel it to be so.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*"Lu’s wine was thin, and Handan..."* (read *han*).
*"Dan"* (read *Dan*).
Handan was the capital of Zhao.
When King Xuan of Chu convened the feudal lords, Duke Gong of Lu arrived late with thin wine. Enraged, the king sought to humiliate him. Duke Gong refused to accept the rebuke, saying, "I am a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, senior among the feudal lords, performing the rites and music of the Son of Heaven, with meritorious service to the House of Zhou. Though I have already erred in presenting the wine, to reproach me further for its thinness—is this not excessive?" Thereupon, he departed without taking leave. Enraged, the king dispatched troops with Qi to attack Lu. King Hui of Liang had long wished to strike Zhao but feared Chu’s rescue. Now that Chu was occupied with Lu, Liang besieged Handan. This illustrates how affairs arise from one another—such is the resonance of cause and effect.
King Xuan was named Xiong Liangfu, son of King Dao. Duke Gong was named Fen, son of Duke Mu.
Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* states: When Chu convened the feudal lords, Lu and Zhao both presented wine to the king. Lu’s wine was thin, while Zhao’s was rich. The officer in charge of wine at Chu’s court demanded wine from Zhao, but Zhao refused. Enraged, the officer exchanged Zhao’s rich wine for Lu’s thin wine and presented it to the king. The king, deeming Zhao’s wine thin, besieged Handan.
◎ Yu Yue notes: The character *jie* here should be read as in *"jie qi wei"* ("lifting its tail"). The *Shuowen*’s explanation of the *shi* (swine) seal script states: *"Jie qi wei, gu wei zhi shi"* ("It lifts its tail, hence it is called *shi*"). The original meaning of *jie* is "to lift," so *"jie qi wei"* means "to lift its tail." Here, *"chun jie"* ("lips lifted") refers to the lips curling upward.
**[Annotation]**
The sage is that which the world exalts.

Should one sever what the world exalts and hold fast to plain simplicity, discard its prohibitions and replace them with few desires—this is how one strikes at the sage and preserves one’s own plain simplicity, how one abandons thieves and brigands and lets their villainy cease of itself. Thus the ancients said: "To guard against depravity and preserve sincerity, one need not rely on keen scrutiny; to quell excess and cast off ornament, one need not resort to harsh punishments." Such is the meaning here.

**[Annotation]**
*Pǒu* means "to strike." "Sage" here refers to the traces of sagacity. The sage’s wisdom encompasses all things, and his Dao sustains the world. Yet to speak of "striking" is to show the intent to reject benevolence and righteousness, to sever sagacity and abandon wisdom. By scorning rare and precious goods, one may forsake thieves and brigands without resorting to harsh punishments, and the world will know great peace.

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*Pǒu*: pronounced *pǔ-kǒu* (反).
*Jī*: pronounced *gǔ-lì* (反) in Xu’s reading.
*Zòngshě*: pronounced *shě* (舍), with the same pronunciation in the annotation.
*Xiánxié*: pronounced *sì-jiē* (反).
*Qùhuá*: pronounced *qǐ-lǚ* (反). The same applies to *qùyù* ("cast off desires") and *qùqí* ("cast off") in the annotation below.

**[11] [Annotation]**
A river runs dry not because the valley is empty, yet the valley is empty; a hill is leveled not because the abyss is full, yet the abyss is full. To sever sagacity is not to stop thievery, yet thievery stops. Thus, stopping thievery lies in casting off desire, not in exalting sagacity and wisdom.

**[Annotation]**
When wisdom and intelligence arise, deceit and falsehood follow; when the traces of sagacity vanish, great thievery ceases. It is like a river running dry and the valley emptying, a hill leveled and the abyss filling—how could one intervene? It is the natural course of things. Death is cessation.

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*"When the sage is dead, great thievery does not arise"*: Xiang explains: "That which daily renews is called life; that which passes away is called death. Thus it is said, 'the sage is dead.'" Riding the constancy of Heaven and Earth, guiding the ceaseless transformations of the new, attaining substance while diminishing its name, returning to truth while forgetting the path—then great thievery ceases.

**[12] [Annotation]**
Not only does thievery cease, but the traces of contention and striving vanish entirely.

**[Annotation]**
*Gù* means "matter." Sever sagacity, abandon wisdom, and the world knows great peace—people sing and play *jīrǎng*, and there are no affairs of deliberate action.

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*Zhēngshàng*: the *zhēng* of contention. The same applies hereafter.

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) The character *yáng* 佯 is amended to *ér* 而 following the original text of *Shuo Yuan*.
(2) The character *chén* 臣 is amended following the original text of *Guanzi*.
(3) Yu’s annotation was originally misplaced beneath the subcommentary; it has now been corrected according to standard practice.

The sage does not die, and great thievery does not cease.
Though one esteems the sage in governing the world, this is but to heap profit upon the thief Zhi.

**[1]**
When measures and pecks are made to gauge, they are stolen along with the measures and pecks;
When scales and balances are made to weigh, they are stolen along with the scales and balances;
When tallies and seals are made to authenticate, they are stolen along with the tallies and seals;
When benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, they are stolen along with benevolence and righteousness.

**[2]**
How do we know this is so?
Those who steal a belt-hook are executed, while those who steal a state become feudal lords. Where the gates of feudal lords stand, benevolence and righteousness abide—is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and wisdom?

**[3]**
Thus, in pursuit of great thieves, one hoists the banners of feudal lords, seizing the benefits of benevolence and righteousness along with measures, scales, tallies, and seals. Though chariots and caps of office be offered as reward, they cannot encourage; though axes and halberds be brandished in threat, they cannot restrain.

**[4]**
That these heaped profits embolden the thief Zhi to the point of defiance is the fault of the sage.

**[1] [Annotation]**
To exalt the sage in governing the world is to provide the likes of Jie and Zhi with their methods. What they are provided is weighty, and thus the profit they derive cannot be light.

**[Subcommentary]**
In an age of pristine simplicity, tranquil and without deliberate action, things return to their roots, and people all recover their destinies—how could they await the traces of teaching to attain obscurity? Yet when sagacity and wisdom are not forgotten, great thievery arises. Though one esteem the sage’s methods in governing the world, this is no different from heaping profit upon the thief Zhi. Why? The reason Jie unleashed his venomous harm and Zhi gave free rein to his rapacity was their reliance upon the traces of the sage. Had there been no traces of the sage, how could Jie have occupied the ninefold throne and poisoned the black-haired people? How could Zhi have amassed troops in the thousands and rampaged across the world? What they relied upon was weighty, and thus the profit they derived was not light. Reasoning thus, the fault lies with sagacity and wisdom.

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*"The sage does not die, and great thievery does not cease"*: Xiang explains: "The sage does not die" means clinging to the old without daily renewal, being led by names without creating substance. That great thievery does not cease is only fitting!

**[2] [Annotation]**
What confounds petty thieves becomes the resource and profit of great thieves.

**[Subcommentary]**
A *hú* 斛 is today’s *hán* 函, used to measure quantity. *Quán* 权 is the weight of a scale, and *héng* 衡 is the beam of a scale, used to balance weight. *Fú* 符 are split into two halves that form a whole—today’s bronze fish or wooden tallies. *Xǐ* 玺 are the jade seals of kings, grasped to summon the world. *Rén* 仁 is kindness; *yì* 义 is propriety. The king’s kindness blankets the black-haired people, and he follows propriety to establish norms, thereby nurturing the common folk. These eight are the world’s instruments of profit, indispensable to one another. When the sage establishes teachings to rectify the state and its households, Tian Cheng uses them to steal the state of Qi—is this not harm to petty thieves and profit to great ones?

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*"When measures and pecks are made to gauge"*: Xiang explains: From here onward, all illustrate that if the person is unfit, even methods are of no benefit.
*"Scales and balances"*: Li explains: *Quán* 权 is the weight of a scale; *héng* 衡 is the beam of a scale. *Chuí* 锤 is pronounced *zhíwěi*.
*"Tallies and seals"*: Pronounced *xǐ*.
*"To rectify"*: Pronounced *jiǎobiǎo*.

**[3] [Subcommentary]**
A *gōu* 钩 is a belt-hook. The rise of the sage’s traces was originally to punish evil and encourage good. Now, those who privately steal a belt-hook must suffer execution, while those who publicly seize the state of Qi become feudal lords. Without benevolence and righteousness, there is no way to lead the masses. Reasoning thus, is this not the theft of the sage’s traces to rob the state? How do we know this is so? The question is hypothetical; from *"Those who steal a belt-hook"* onward is the hypothetical answer.

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*"Steal a belt-hook"*: *Gōu* 钩 refers to a belt.
◎ Wang Yinzhi notes: *Cún yān* 存焉 should read *yān cún* 焉存. *Yān* 焉 means "in this." The *Lüshi Chunqiu* "Jichun" chapter annotation states: *Yān* 焉 means "in this." The *Pinli* states: "At the offering, one emits *qi* and thus fills one’s bearing," meaning one emits *qi* and thus fills one’s bearing in this. The *Yueling* states: "The Son of Heaven then first boards the boat," (the current text places *yān* 焉 after the preceding clause, beneath *"gào zhōu xiépèi yú tiānzǐ"* 告舟偕具于天子, which later readers, not understanding the syntax, altered. Here, it is corrected according to the *Lüshi Chunqiu* "Jichun" chapter and the *Huainanzi* "Shize" chapter.) meaning the Son of Heaven first boards the boat in this. The *Guoyu* states: "Then first issued commands," meaning commands were first issued in this. The *Liji* "Sannian Wen" states: "Thus the former kings then established the mean and regulated moderation," meaning the former kings established the mean and regulated moderation in this. (The *Xunzi* "Lilun" chapter writes *yān* 焉 as *ān* 安. Yang Liang notes: *Ān* 安 is a particle. Sometimes written as *ān* 安, sometimes as *àn* 案; the *Xunzi* frequently uses this character. *Yān* 焉, *ān* 安, and *àn* 案 are synonymous; see *Shici* for details.) The *Huainanzi* "Dahuang Nan Jing" states: "On the Cloud Rain Mountain is a tree called *luán* 栾, from which the assembled emperors then took medicine," meaning the assembled emperors took medicine in this. The *Guanzi* "Kuidu" chapter states: "When the people’s wealth is sufficient, the ruler’s taxes and levies then cannot be exhausted," meaning taxes and levies cannot be exhausted in this. The *Mozi* "Fei Gong" chapter states: "Heaven then commanded Tang at the *Biāo* 镳 Palace to receive the great mandate of Xia. Tang then dared to lead his masses toward the borders of Xia," meaning Tang then dared to attack Xia in this. The *Chuci* "Jiuzhang" states: "Then roaming freely as a guest," and "Then unfurling emotions and drawing forth sincerity," meaning roaming freely as a guest in this, and unfurling emotions and drawing forth sincerity in this.

Moreover, the *Zuozhuan* for the fifteenth year of Duke Xi states: "In this, Jin then instituted the *yuán* fields; in this, Jin then instituted the *zhōu* militia," while the *Guoyu* renders it as "therein instituted the *yuán* fields; therein instituted the *zhōu* militia." The *Stratagems of the Warring States* "Western Zhou" chapter states: "What does the lord have to fear in this?" which the *Records of the Grand Historian*, "Annals of Zhou," renders as "What does the lord have to fear herein?" Thus, *yān* and *yúshì* share the same meaning. The *Gongyang Commentary* for the eighth year of Duke Zhuang states: "I shall on the *jiǎwǔ* day then offer sacrifice to the troops in this," while the *Guanzi* "Minor Inquiries" chapter states: "Moreover, I observe that among the lesser feudal lords who do not submit, only Ju is thus," showing that *yúshì* and *yān* are synonymous. These four phrases rhyme *zhū* (诛) with *hóu* (侯) and *mén* (门) with *cún* (存), with the rhymes all falling at the ends of the lines. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, "Biographies of Wandering Knights," renders it as: "Those who steal hooks are executed; those who steal states become lords. At the gates of lords, benevolence and righteousness reside," which clearly demonstrates this.

---

The cap and chariot, the axe and halberd—these are the weightiest of rewards and punishments. Employing heavy rewards and punishments to prohibit theft, yet the great thieves pursue and seize them, turning them instead to the thieves’ own use. What is wielded with such weight thus becomes the very means by which great theft is accomplished. The great thief, acting with benevolence and righteousness, leveling with scales and steelyards, verifying with seals and tallies, encouraging with caps and chariots, and intimidating with axes and halberds, steals these public instruments—only then can the feudal lords be lifted and carried away. Thus, benevolence, righteousness, rewards, and punishments are precisely sufficient to execute those who steal hooks.

---

To pursue is to follow. To encourage is to urge. To prohibit is to restrain. *Xuān* is a chariot; *miǎn* is a crown. The establishment of sagely traces was originally meant to suppress villainy and deceit, yet Tian Heng employed their methods to steal the state of Qi. Scales, steelyards, seals, and tallies—he possessed them all, lifting the feudal lords and calmly facing south as a ruler. How could he be encouraged with caps and chariots or intimidated with axes and halberds? The smaller is called an *fǔ* (axe), the larger a *yuè* (halberd). It is also said: "gold-adorned axes and halberds."

---

Now, the unprohibitable nature of Robber Zhi arises from the weight of what he steals. The weight of that gain arises from the sagely not treating it lightly. Thus, the eradication of theft lies in devaluing goods, not in exalting sageliness.

---

That Robber Zhi could command ninety thousand followers and rampage across the world was also due to the Five Virtues. Without sagely wisdom, how could this have been achieved? Thus, one knows that the driving of horses and plundering of people—unrestrainable as they are—originate in the errors of the sages’ creation of laws. Hence it is said: "Fish cannot be removed from the depths; the state’s sharp instruments cannot be displayed to others." Those sages are the state’s sharp instruments, not what should be made manifest to the world. Therefore, abolish sageliness and discard wisdom, and great theft will cease; cast away jade and shatter pearls, and petty theft will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity and rusticity; smash measuring cups and snap steelyards, and the people will not contend; annihilate and destroy the world’s sagely laws, and only then can the people be engaged in discussion. Uproot and disorder the six pitch-pipes, melt and sever the *yú* and *sè*, stop up Master Kuang’s ears, and the world’s people will begin to contain their hearing; obliterate patterns and disperse the five colors, glue shut Li Zhu’s eyes, and the world’s people will begin to contain their vision. Break and discard hooks and cords, cast away compasses and squares, snap off the fingers of Master Chui, and the world’s people will begin to possess their own skill. Thus it is said: "Great skill appears clumsy." Eradicate the conduct of Zeng and Shi, gag the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will begin to attain profound unity. When people contain their vision, the world will not be dazzled; when people contain their hearing, the world will not be burdened; when people contain their knowledge, the world will not be deluded; when people contain their virtue, the world will not be perverse. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Master Kuang, Master Chui, and Li Zhu all externally established their virtue and thereby confused and disordered the world—such are the methods that have no use.

---

Fish that lose the depths are captured by men; sharp instruments made manifest become resources for thieves—thus they cannot be displayed to others.

---

To lose is to be deprived. Sharp instruments refer to sagely traces. To display is to make manifest. Fish deprived of water are seized by creatures; sharp instruments made manifest are grasped by men—thus they cannot be.

---

The sages—these are men like Yao, Shun, Wen, and Wu. My late father observed: If one borrows the sages’ wisdom to reap their benefits, the world will all borrow and employ them, making them indeed the world’s sharp instruments. The world borrows the sages as sharp instruments, yet only fears that others will uncover what they conceal—thus there are none who can make them manifest.

---

Displaying sharp instruments to the world provides resources for its thieves and bandits.

---

The sages govern the world by responding to things and adapting to the times, yielding or wielding weapons, their conduct and concealment not uniform—they cannot be rigidly grasped and made manifest to the world. If grasped and acted upon, their flaws will inevitably emerge, as with King Kuai of Yan and the Duke of Bai.

---

To remove what thieves rely upon is to halt them without imposing prohibitions.

When sagely wisdom is discarded, all things under heaven abide by their proper roles, and theft ceases of itself.

To devalue what is prized is to end transgression without resorting to punishment.

Jade is left in the mountains, pearls in the rivers—when jewels and treasures are no longer esteemed, how can there be theft and excess?

To eliminate what deceit depends upon is to leave no means for cunning and artifice.

Seals and tallies serve as tokens of sincerity. Yet deceitful men rely on them to advance their schemes. Burn them, shatter them, and one may return to simplicity and rustic purity.

For what is small and level serves as the tool of what is great and uneven.

Scales and measures determine quantity and weight. Once stolen, they become the thief’s own resource. Smash and destroy them, aligning with the wisdom of the ancients, and strife will vanish.

When nothing is feigned outwardly, one’s inner nature remains whole and unspoiled, free from self-betraying words.

To exhaust and destroy: to annihilate and ruin. The sagely laws refer to the Five Powers. Having shattered the ways of the Three Kings and ruined those of the Five Emperors, the thatched hut and all else are obliterated, straw dogs no longer displayed. Forgetting the trap and the snare, self and other merge into profound unity—only then may one discuss the most subtle realms and expound upon the distant reaches of the Dao and virtue.

What is prized—sounds and sights, separation and distance—are what those with ears and eyes cherish. Yet life is allotted its portion, and to be drawn by what one prizes is to lose one’s nature and life. If instead one destroys what is prized and abandons external things to follow one’s own nature, then hearing and sight remain whole, and each person preserves their true essence.

The *yu* resembles the *sheng*, with pipes arranged within a gourd and reeds placed at the ends of the tubes. The *se* is eight feet and one inch long, one foot and eight inches wide, with twenty-seven strings, crafted by Fuxi. When the ears are seduced by the five notes, one admires the acuity of Master Kuang; when the eyes linger on dark and bright hues, one yearns for the vision of Li Zhu—thus the heart-mind races wildly, and ears and eyes are utterly exhausted.

Thereupon, one pulls out the pipes and severs the strings, melts away warp and weft; destroys the melody of *Huanghua*, discards the song of *Baixue*; erases the patterns of *fufu*, scatters the hues of red and purple. Thus, one glues shut the eyes of Li Zhu and removes the pretense of imitation; stops up the ears of Kuang and Gu and dispels the leaders of disorderly crowds. Only then do all people attain self-mastery, and things no longer diminish the self. The ears reach the limit of what they can hear yet return to hearing silence; the eyes indulge their power of sight yet inwardly perceive no color. The celestial mechanism unfolds of itself, reaching the perfection of non-action—how could there be any distinction of brightness or darkness, superiority or inferiority?

Thus, the world attains peace, and the myriad things share in virtue. Following one’s own hearing and seeing, each person preserves their acuity. To *preserve* is to nurture within.

The *se* was originally also written as *sheng*. To *stop up* Kuang and Gu: Cui’s edition has *stop up* as *block*, meaning to obstruct. ◊ Lu Wenchang notes: The present edition lacks the character *Gu*.

The spider and the dung beetle, though base, weave webs and roll pellets—if they did not seek this from master craftsmen, it is because each thing possesses its own ability. Though their abilities differ, none dares deviate from what they practice, and so what is skillful may appear clumsy. Thus, one who excels in employing others has those capable of squares make squares, those capable of circles make circles, each entrusted with what they can do. People rest in their natures, not demanding of the common folk the skill of Gongshu. Therefore, when the many arts do not imitate one another, they appear clumsy, yet when all under heaven rely on their own abilities, great skill is achieved.

To employ their innate abilities is to discard compass and square, rendering the fingers of the master craftsman superfluous.

Hooks curve; plumb lines straighten; compasses circle; squares square. Gongshu was a craftsman of Yao who devised the methods of compass and square—also said to be a minister of Shun. To *break* is to snap or sever. Gongshu, endowed with natural ingenuity, wielded hooks and plumb lines, carved and cut diverse forms, and established compass and square, thereby leading the black-haired people of the world to blindly imitate, abandoning themselves to follow things—this is the very cause. If one were to cast aside compass and square, sever hooks and plumb lines, and snap the fingers of Gongshu, then each person would master their own inner skill. It is like the spider’s web and the beetle’s pellet—what do they have to do with the work of craftsmen? It is the ingenuity of the celestial mechanism! The saying originates from the *Laozi*.

To *break*: Guo and Li read *shì* (burn), Xiang and Xu read *yào* (melt). Cui says: to burn and sever. The *yu*: Xu reads *yú*. The *se*: originally also written as *sheng*. ◊ Lu Wenchang notes: The old edition mistakenly wrote *name* instead of *sound*; corrected according to the *Dasheng* chapter. The *spider*: read *zhī*. The *beetle*: read *jié*. The *dung beetle*: read *qiāng*.

To remove the leaders who disrupt the multitude is to allow the world each to return to its place and unite in the mysterious virtue.

To *cut away*: to eliminate. *To clamp*: to shut. *To cast aside*: to reject. *Mysterious*: origin, the Dao. Zeng Shen was supremely filial, Shi Yu was loyal and upright, Yang Zhu and Mo Di were endowed with vast eloquence. These four masters, by their innate nature, led the scholars of the world to abandon themselves and imitate things, thereby disrupting the multitude and losing their original nature. Thus, one must cut away acts of loyalty and trust, clamp shut mouths of vain disputation, cast aside the stumbling benevolence, and discard the striving righteousness. Then things do not lose their truth, people all attain their own fulfillment, follow their nature and preserve its principle—thereby merging with the mysterious Dao.

*Of conduct*: Meng reads *xíng*. *To clamp*: Li reads *jùyán*, also *qíyán*. *To cast aside*: reads *rúyáng*. *The leader*: also written as *rate*, reads *suǒlèi*.

To *melt*: to disperse. *Burden*: care and suffering. Merely flaunting one’s intelligence brings about the accumulation of cares, causing the people to stumble and disperse. If one could embrace intelligence within and not display it outwardly, then all things would be content and free from care.

*Not to melt*: Zhu reads *shī*, reads *zhuó*. Cui says: not to destroy. Xiang reads *yào*.

If one can know one’s inner portion, cultivate virtue without excess, then one naturally treads the central path of the turning circle, roams the world without confusion—how could there be inversion or perversion in between?

*Not perverse*: reads *pìyì*.

These several figures, each endowed with diverse gifts, caused the world to leap and imitate them. In imitation, one loses oneself; losing oneself through them, they become the source of disorder. The greatest affliction of the world is the loss of oneself.

The aforementioned masters, all endowed with exceptional qualities, could not conceal their brilliance or hide their radiance. Instead, they stirred the waves and provoked the俗, flaunting their names to attract followers and dazzle the multitude. The world, bereft of virtue, failed to return to its root—this is the cause of losing one’s origin.

*To dazzle*: Xu reads *yào*. The *Three Cang* says: firelight consuming. Sima and Cui say: to scatter. *These several*: reads *suǒzhǔ*.

As for the proper use of standards: sight does not exceed what is seen, so all eyes are clear; hearing does not exceed what is heard, so all ears are keen; action does not exceed what is possible, so all skills are masterful; knowledge does not exceed what is known, so all natures are content; virtue does not exceed what is attained, so all virtues are fitting. Why establish what lies beyond one’s nature, causing the world to rush about and be unable to return to itself?

To act in accordance with nature, and every act arises from nature—this is the subtlety of standards. Yet the followers of Zeng and Shi, by drawing others to themselves, brought no benefit to their age and instead harmed posterity. Though they set these standards, they were ultimately of no use.

Do you alone not know the age of utmost virtue? In ancient times, there were Rongcheng, Datíng, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong. In those days, the people used knotted cords for records. They found their food sweet, their clothing beautiful, their customs joyful, and their dwellings peaceful. Neighboring states were within sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs were within hearing, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling between them. In such an age, there was perfect governance.

Now, however, it has come to this: the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “In such-and-such a place there is a worthy,” then carry provisions and rush toward them. They abandon their parents at home and forsake their lords’ affairs abroad. Footprints crisscross the borders of the feudal lords, and carriage tracks extend beyond a thousand *li*. This is because those above excessively favor knowledge.

*Enough to record essentials.*

The twelve rulers above were all ancient emperors. At that time, there were no historical records, nor was the order of their succession known. They carved wood for contracts and knotted cords for trust. Above and below were at peace, and human hearts were pure. Thus the *Yi* says: In high antiquity, governance was by knotted cords; later sages replaced them with written contracts.

*Rongcheng*: Sima says: These twelve were all ancient emperors. *Li*: Xu reads *lìchí*, Li reads *lí*. *Xu*: Xu reads *chìliù*. *Fuxi*: reads *xī*.

*What is fitting is always sweet; what is proper is always beautiful. If one longs for extravagance and excess, there will never be satisfaction.*

*Dissatisfaction*: reads *kǒuqiàn*.

*Content with their portion, thus sweet; free from adornment, thus beautiful; undivided, thus joyful; tranquil, thus at peace.*

*Joyful*: reads *lè*.

*Utmost in having no desires.*

The villages and towns stood close together, not far apart, so that the crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs could be heard from one to another, reaching each other. Yet each nature was self-sufficient, with no demands upon the world, and they met their end by Heaven’s decree without coming or going—this was the perfection of non-action.

*Variant*: One version reads *without coming and going to each other*.

Collation: The Guo edition from the Yuanjia era and the Cui edition from the Yonghe era both omit the character *with*.

Such was the time when, free from desires and seeking nothing, one embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue—was this not perfection!

*Perfection of governance*: reads *zhìlì*. The annotation is the same.

The traces of perfect governance still led to such abuses.

*Yíng*: means *to wrap*. This was also the wind of perfect governance, spread abroad as teaching, valuing these written traces and causing people to study them. The path of exalting the worthy was opened, and people sought teachers and inquired after the Dao, stretching their necks and lifting their feet to travel far to other lands. Wheeltracks crisscrossed, footprints overlapped, and they wrapped their provisions and carried their burdens, undaunted by a thousand miles. Within, they abandoned their parents and were unfilial; without, they left their lords and were disloyal. Thus the traces of perfect governance led to such abuses.

*Neck*: reads as written. Li reads *jùyíng*. *Yíng*: reads *yíng*. Cui says: means *to wrap*. The *Guangya* says: means *to carry*. *Provisions*: reads *liáng*. *And hasten*: Qiyu reads *qīyú*; Xu reads *qīyù*.

◎ Qingfan’s note: *Guǐ* means *to clear tracks*. The *Shuowen* says: *Guǐ* means *the clearance of a chariot*, from *chē* (cart) and *jiǔ* (nine) as phonetic. (Note: *Chè* means *to penetrate*, hollow and open. The classics and commentaries often gloss *guǐ* as *the front of a chariot’s shaft*, but this is likely a corruption of *fàn*. The *Shuowen* says: *Fàn* means *the front of a chariot’s rail*, from *chē* and *fán* as phonetic.) Since chariot tracks and footprints are paired in the text, it is clear that *guǐ* refers to chariot tracks. (The *Kaogongji*’s *Jiangren* says *all accommodate the strength of nine tracks*, and Zheng’s annotation says: *Guǐ* means *the breadth of clearance*. *Jié* means *to intersect*.) Chariot tracks can run parallel or cross diagonally. When they cross diagonally, they intersect; *intersecting tracks* thus means *intersecting clearances*. The *Guanzi*’s *Xiao Kuang* chapter says *chariots do not intersect tracks*, where *chè* means *tracks*. Gao’s annotation: *Jié* means *to intersect*. The tracks of chariot wheels run lengthwise and crosswise, intersecting one another, hence called *intersecting tracks*. The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Biography of Sima Xiangru* says *intersecting tracks to reach the shafts*, and the *Suoyin* cites Zhang Yi’s annotation: *Jié* means *to bend*; *guǐ* means *chariot tracks*. Originally traveling west, they turned east, so the tracks also curved eastward.

Those above—namely, rulers who delight in knowledge—by knowing and delighting in it, incur such faults.

They exalted the traces of perfect governance and delighted in the knowledge of ordering things, thus bringing about these abuses.

*Above delights*: reads *hàobào*. The annotation below is the same.

If those above truly delight in knowledge and lack the Dao, then the world will be thrown into great chaos. How do we know this is so?

When the knowledge of bows, crossbows, nets, arrows, triggers, and traps becomes excessive, birds are thrown into chaos in the skies. When the knowledge of hooks, bait, nets, weirs, and fish traps becomes excessive, fish are thrown into chaos in the waters. When the knowledge of snares, fences, nets, and traps becomes excessive, beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes. When the knowledge of deceit, gradual corruption, cunning, obstinacy, sophistry, disputation, and the distinctions of same and different becomes excessive, the common folk are bewildered by argumentation.

Thus the world is repeatedly thrown into great chaos, and the blame lies in delighting in knowledge. Therefore, the world all knows to seek what it does not know but does not know to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it does not consider good but does not know to condemn what it already considers good. This is why there is great chaos.

Thus above, it obscures the brightness of the sun and moon; below, it scorches the essence of mountains and rivers; and in between, it disrupts the operations of the four seasons. Even the trembling insects and the fluttering creatures—none fail to lose their natures. How extreme is the chaos brought to the world by delighting in knowledge!

This has been the case since the Three Dynasties and after. Abandoning the people of diverse natures, they delight in the flattery of the restless; forsaking the tranquility of non-action, they delight in the clamor of empty words—and clamor has already thrown the world into chaos!

The ruler above, unable to practice non-action and tranquility, to be empty and in accord with the Dao, but instead ordering things with knowledge, will surely bring ruin to them, thus causing great chaos. Laozi said: *To govern the state with knowledge is the state’s thief.*

This is a hypothetical question to reveal the cause.

The more densely one attacks, the more skillfully one evades, so that even birds and beasts cannot be captured with knowledge—how much less so with people! Therefore, those who govern the world must not rely on knowledge; relying on knowledge is not subtle.

*Nets* are small and have handles, resembling the *Bì* constellation, hence the name *bì*. *Yì* refers to shooting with an arrow tied to a string. *Gǔ* are all nets. *Gǒu* is a curved weir, also a fish trap, made by sharpening branches—like today’s deer-antler spears or horse pikes—using ropes and wooden fences to catch beasts. *Jūfú* is a rabbit net. Since one uses knowledge to order things, how can there be no boiling turmoil? Thus, those who govern the state must not employ knowledge.

*Crossbow*: reads *nǔ*. *Bì, yì, triggers, and traps*: Li says: *Bì* is a rabbit net; *yì* is shooting with a tethered arrow; *jī* is the trigger of a crossbow. *Knowledge*: reads *zhì* here and below, as well as in the annotation and *knowledge of deceit*. *Hook and bait*: reads *rúzhì*. *Nets*: reads *zēng*. ◎ Lu Wenchang says: The current text writes *wǎng* as *net*. *Gǒu*: reads *gōu*, a fishing hook.

Bait is fish bait. The *Guangya* states: *gǔ* is called *wǎng*. *Zēng* is a fish net. The *Erya* states: a widow’s *gǒu* is called □.

◎ Wang Niansun says: *Diào* was originally written as *钓*, and *钓* is *gōu*. The current text writes *钩* because later scholars, knowing only that *钓* means "to fish," were unaware that it also serves as an alternate name for *gōu*, and thus altered it arbitrarily. Now, consider the *Guangya*, which states: *Diào* is *gōu*. The *Tian Zifang* chapter says: King Wen observed Zang and saw a man fishing, yet his *diào* did not fish—he did not hold his *diào* as one who fishes, but as one who *diào*s constantly. (Of these six *diào* characters, only the two in "his *diào*" and "hold his *diào*" refer to *gōu*; the remaining four are read as "to fish.") The *Mohist Canon*’s *Mo Pian* states: "Like wielding a *diào* over a deep abyss"; the *Huainanzi*’s *Shuō Shān* chapter says: "Holding a *diào* to ascend a mountain, raising an axe to enter the depths"; its *Shuō Lín* chapter says: "A one-eyed net cannot catch birds; a *diào* without bait cannot catch fish"; Dongfang Shuo’s *Qi Jie* says: "To use a straight needle as a *diào*—what fish could one catch?" Thus, the ancients called *gōu* *diào*.

Furthermore, the *Shiwen* states: *ěr* is read *rúzhì*; *zēng* is read *zēng*; *gǒu* is read *gǒu*—these are the pronunciations for *ěr*, *zēng*, and *gǒu*. Below, it states: *Diào* is *gōu*; *ěr* is fish bait. The *Guangya* says: *Gǔ* is called *wǎng*; *zēng* is a fish net. The *Erya* says: a widow’s *gǒu* is called □. These explain the meanings of the six characters *diào*, *ěr*, *wǎng*, *gǔ*, and *gǒu*. Later scholars, having already altered the *diào* in the main text to *gōu*, further changed the six characters in the *Shiwen*—*gǒu* read *gǒu*, *diào* is *gōu*—to *gǒu* read *gōu*, *diào* is *gōu*, compounding the error. Moreover, in the *Waiwu* chapter, Ren Gongzi made a great *gōu* with thick black silk; the *Shiwen* notes: *Gōu* was originally also written as *diào*, and the latter is correct. The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Qi Qi*, Fu Xian’s annotation to his poem *Zeng He Shao Wang Ji*, Xie Lingyun’s commentary on *Qi Li Lai*, and the *Taiping Yulan*’s *Zichan* section, volume fourteen, all cite this passage as *diào*. In the *Liezi*’s *Tang Wen* chapter, Zhan He used a flaxen needle as a *diào*; later scholars altered *diào* to *gōu*, unaware that the *Yulan* cites this passage as *diào*. Further below, in "casting the line and sinking the *diào*," modern editions write *gōu* instead of *diào*, another alteration by later scholars. The *Yunfu Qunyu*’s entry for *diào* cites the *Liezi*’s "casting the line and sinking the *diào*," showing that the edition it consulted still used *diào*. In the *Zhan Guo Ce*’s *Qi Ce*, "Have you not heard of the great fish of the sea? Nets cannot restrain it, *diào* cannot pull it"—later scholars altered *diào* to *gōu*, unaware that the *Yulan*’s *Lin Jie* section, volume seven, cites this as *diào*, and the *Huainanzi*’s *Ren Jian* chapter also uses *diào*. In the *Huainanzi*’s *Shuō Shān* chapter, "People do not cherish the pearls of the Yangtze and Han but cherish their own *diào*," Gao You’s commentary states: *Diào* is *gōu*. Later scholars, having already altered the *diào* in the main text to *gōu*, further changed the commentary to read *gōu* and *diào*, compounding the error. This arose because later scholars, unaware that *diào* is an alternate name for *gōu*, altered what they did not know based on what they did know, and the ancient meanings gradually vanished.

*Xuē* is read *qiào*. *Gé* is read *gǔbǎi*. Li says: *Xuēgé* are used to deploy nets. *Luōluòjū* is read *zǐxié*. *Fú* is also written as *fú*, read *fú*. The *Erya* states: bird nets are called *luō*; rabbit nets are called *jū*; *jué* is called *fú*; *fú* is an overturned cart. Guo Pu says: This refers to today’s *fānchē*.

◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Shiwen* cites Li’s note: *Xuēgé* are used to deploy nets. The *Shuowen* states: *Gé* means "long wood." Xu Kai says: Long branches are *gé*. *Xuēgé* means to scrape and cut them. Zheng’s commentary on the *Zhouli*’s *Yongshi* refers to *zuò’è*. The *Book of Documents*’ *Fei Shi* says *dù nǎi huò*. The *Zhengyi*’s *huò* is a beast-catching trap. Zuo Si’s *Wu Du Fu* says *qiàogé zhōu shī*, where *qiào* and *xuē* share the same meaning. *Gé* implies resistance. *Xuēgé* and *luōluò* are both used to block and intercept birds and beasts. The *Hanshu*’s *Chao Cuo Zhuan* says *wéi zhōng zhōu hǔluò*; Yan Shigu’s commentary states: This means to enclose and block. *Xuēgé* is the *huò* in pit traps. *Luōluò* shares the same meaning as the *bìyì* above. The *Yupian* states: *Yì* is a stake, also written as *yì*. The *Erya*’s *Shi Gong* says: *Yǐn* is called *yì*; Guo Pu’s commentary states: This is a stake. *Bìyì* means to deploy *yì* to stretch *bì*. In the *Ren Jian Shi* chapter, the stakes for monkeys are used to tether them. The *Shuowen* states: *Shuài* is a bird-catching *bì*. The *Book of Songs*’ *Xiao Ya* says *bì zhī luō zhī*. Bird nets are also called *bì*. Li’s note—"rabbit nets are called *bì*; tethered arrows are called *yì*"—is incorrect.

【Four】【Annotation】What those above possess in abundance, those below cannot secure in their scarcity. By nature scarce yet chasing abundance, one becomes lost.

【Exegesis】Cunning and deceit gradually poison and harm things. *Jié gǔ* means "slippery and cunning," also "treacherous and crafty." *Jiě gòu* means "deceit and falsehood." The cleverness of *gǔjī jiānbái* and the sophistry of *juéguǐ tóngyì* surely undermine truth and offer no benefit to worldly teachings. Thus, from afar, they resemble the inarticulate, while the foolish masses are misled by petty arguments.

【Shiwen】*Jiàn dú*: Li says: The poison of gradual infiltration runs deep without notice. Cui says: *Jiàn dú* means "profound harm." ◎ Qingfan notes: *Zhī* is interchangeable with *zhì*, meaning "cunning." The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhu Shu* commentary states: *Gù* means "crafty." The *Guanzi*’s *Xin Shu* says to discard *zhī* and *gù*; the *Xunzi*’s *Fei Shi Er Zi* says *zhī ér xiǎn*; the *Huainanzi*’s *Yuan Dao* says *ǒu zhì gù*—all share the meaning of this *zhī* character.

"Gradual" means deception. The *Xunzi*’s *Discourse on Military Affairs* employs *jiàn* in this sense: when upright discourse above embraces peril and danger, deception and falsehood arise below—all denoting the meaning of deceit. (Li Yi’s interpretation of *jiàn* as "the poison of gradual infiltration" misses the mark entirely.)

The *Book of Documents* states, "The people arise in mutual deception." Wang Niansun says: *Jiàn* means deception, for when the common people rise to deceive and cheat, the subsequent text reads, "None adhere to trustworthiness," thus overturning oaths and covenants. Those who gloss *jiàn* as "gradual transformation" fail to connect it with the following text.

*Jié* is pronounced *hùjié*; *gǔ* is pronounced *gānbā*. *Jié-gǔ* refers to what is difficult to manage. Cui says: "tangled and contorted." Li pronounces it *gǔ* (as in *gǔjī*, "slippery and artful"). Another interpretation: *jié-gǔ* refers to perverse speech.

*Jiě* is pronounced *kǔxiè*; *gòu* is pronounced *kǔdòu*. Sima and Cui say: *jiě-gòu* means "obstructed and angular." Another interpretation: "devious and crooked words."

【Five】【Commentary】*Měiměi* describes a state of confusion and obscurity. When one forgets personal concerns and follows things as they are, the world remains clear and harmonious; when one clings to traces and employs cunning, the world falls into great disorder. Thus, the muddled state of superiors and inferiors arises from the love of cleverness.

【Shiwen】*Měiměi*: Li says: "akin to *hūnhūn* (confused)." ◎ Qingfan notes: *Měiměi* is equivalent to *mèngmèng*. The *Erya*’s *Explanation of Terms* states: *Mèngmèng zhūnzhūn* means "chaos." The shift from *mèng* to *měi* parallels that from *méng* to *méi* (as in *méng* [ridgepole], now written *méi*). (The *Fangyan* says *méi* is called *méi*; Guo’s annotation: "The modern character is *méi*.")

【Six】【Commentary】To abandon what one knows in pursuit of what one does not know is to forsake the self and imitate others, exceeding one’s proper bounds.

【Exegesis】What one knows lies within one’s proper bounds; what one does not know lies beyond them. To forsake the internal in pursuit of the external—how could this not be delusion?

【Shiwen】*Shě jǐ*: pronounced *shě*; the same below.

【Seven】【Commentary】To esteem what one deems good is the origin of contention and rivalry.

【Exegesis】What is deemed not good refers to Jie and Zhi; what is deemed good refers to the sagely traces. Robber Zhi practiced evil to seize Dongling, while Tian Heng followed sagely traces to usurp the state of Qi. Thus, though Zang and Gu pursued different paths, both lost their sheep; though Yi and Zhi acted differently, both harmed their nature. The foolish masses recklessly pass judgment, declaring things good or not good—yet such distinctions are truly unreliable.

【Eight】【Commentary】Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action. Yet the movements of knowledge can indeed shake heaven and earth, governing the multitudes of beings. How, then, can a ruler fail to forget his knowledge?

【Exegesis】This continues the preceding discourse. Precisely because rulers have employed knowledge and clung to traces, the world has fallen into great disorder. *Bèi* means chaos; *shuò*, dissolution; *duò*, ruin. Creatures that cling to the earth are called *zhuìruǎn*; those that flit through the air, *xiāoqiào*—all are small and insignificant. Yet clinging to traces and employing knowledge brings such grave harm that it can stir yin and yang, shake heaven and earth, cause the sun and moon to eclipse, the mountains and rivers to collapse and dry up, disrupt the order of heat and cold, and make wind and rain untimely. Creatures of flight and walk, water and land lose their original nature—so poisonous is the love of knowledge.

【Shiwen】*Shàng bèi*: Li and Guo say: "must inwardly rebel"; also pronounced *pèi*. Sima says: "refers to eclipses." *Xià shuò*: *shīyuē* rhyme. Cui says: "means dissolution." Sima says: "means collapse and exhaustion." Cui and Xiang originally wrote *lì*, same as *shuò*. Xu pronounces it *yào*. *Zhōng duò*: *xǔguī* rhyme, means "ruin." *Zhī shī*: *shǐchǐ* rhyme. *Zhuì*: also written as *□* or *chuǎn*, *chuānyǎn* rhyme. Xiang pronounces it *chuǎi*. *Ruǎn*: *ěrzhuǎn* rhyme. Cui says: "*xuānruǎn* are wriggling insects." Another says: "*zhuìruǎn* refers to legless creatures." *Xiāoqiào*: *xiāo*; below, *qíráo* rhyme. Cui says: "*xiāoqiào* are plants." Li says: "refers to creatures like *xuān* in flight."

【Nine】【Commentary】*Tūntūn* describes teaching others by one’s own example.

【Exegesis】*Zì* means "from." The Three Dynasties refer to Xia, Yin, and Zhou. *Zhǒngzhǒng* describes the simple and unadorned; *yìyì*, the frivolous and cunning. *Shì* means "abandon." *Tūntūn* means teaching others by one’s own example. In the most ancient age of perfect simplicity, when the world was unspoiled, people emulated the round heaven in clarity and emptiness, modeled the square earth in tranquility and stillness, united the myriad things as one family, and lived like birds and beasts in ignorance. But when purity dissolved and craftiness arose, the Way was abandoned and virtue forsaken. The sagely traces of the Five Emperors became manifest, and the Three Dynasties employed knowledge to an even greater degree. They forsook the simple and unadorned, cherished the frivolous and cunning, abandoned the self-contentment of desirelessness, and delighted in teaching others with a mind of intention—thus throwing the world into chaos. Is this not lamentable?

【Shiwen】*Zhǒngzhǒng*: Xiang pronounces it *zhāngyǒng*; Li says: "means cautious." Another says: "means honest and sincere." *Ér yuè*: pronounced *yuè*, same below. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: "The modern text writes *yuè*." *Yìyì*: Li says: "means cunning." Another says: "means acting for others." *Tián*: *túqiān* rhyme. *Dàn*: *túzhàn* rhyme; Xu pronounces it *dàgǎn*. *Tūntūn*: Li pronounces it *zhīrùn*, also *zhīchún*; Guo pronounces it *dūn*, meaning "teaching others by one’s own example," same below. Sima says: "means lacking in knowledge." Xu pronounces it *xǔpēng*, also *xǔgāng*; Xiang originally wrote *tūn*, pronounced *hēng*. Cui’s text has the first instance as *hēnghēng*, meaning "lacking knowledge and dull." Another says: "*hēnghēng* means robust." ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: "The modern text writes *tūntūn* in both instances. According to the *shuōwén*, it may also be pronounced *hēng*." 【Collation】(1) Zhao’s *Jiànyì* edition writes *chuǎn*. (2) The *Shìdétáng* edition writes *mín* as *jī*; Zhao’s edition writes *mín*. (3) The *Shìdétáng* edition writes *wǎng*; this text follows the *Shiwen* in emending it. (4) The original *Shiwen* lacks the character *yīn*. (5) The character *zuò* follows the *Zhōulǐ* Zheng annotation in emendation. (6) The character *□* follows the *Huáinánzǐ* in emendation. (7) The character *□* follows the *Fāngyán* in emendation. (8) Zhao’s edition writes *zhǐ* as *zhèng*.

**Outer Chapters: "In Yu" XI**
**XI. Outer Chapters: "In Yu"**
【One】【Shiwen】The chapter is named for its theme. ◎ Qingfan notes: The *Wenxuan* quotes Sima: "*Zài* means observation; *yòu*, leniency." The *Shiwen* omits this. I have heard that to "be *in yòu* with the world" is not to "govern the world." To *zài* it is to fear the world’s corruption of its nature; to *yòu* it is to fear the world’s alteration of its virtue.

【Two】If the world neither corrupts its nature nor alters its virtue, does it need governing? In ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made the world joyful, each delighting in their nature—this was not *tián*. When Jie governed the world, he made the world weary, each suffering in their nature—this was not *yú*. That which is neither *tián* nor *yú* is not virtue. There is nothing in the world that is not virtue yet can endure for long.

【Five】

【I】
◎ Annotation: To *yòu* is to let things be at ease, which is governance; to govern them is to bring chaos. Man’s life is upright by nature, and if nothing sways it, then nature and destiny will not transgress, and desires and aversions will not err. Those above cannot be without action, and whatever those above do, the people all rush toward it—thus there are enticements and longings for desires, and the people’s nature becomes corrupted. Therefore, what is prized in a sage-king is not that he can govern, but that he does nothing and lets things act of themselves.

◎ Subcommentary: *Yòu* means leniency; *zài*, ease. *Zhì* means control. As the parable says, I have heard that when the worthy and sage entrust things to their own ease and leniency, the world is at peace; but if they establish teachings to control the common people, things lose their nature—like Bo Le training horses.

◎ *Shiwen*: *Wén zài yòu* (聞在宥): *yòu* is read as leniency. *Zé zhì* (則治): *zhì* is read as *zhílì* (直吏). The same applies to *zhì luàn* (治乱) below. *Yù wù* (欲恶): *wù* is read as *wùlù* (乌路). *Hào yù* (好欲): *hào* is read as *hūbào* (呼报).

【II】
◎ Subcommentary: Nature is the principle bestowed at birth; virtue is the name for meritorious conduct. Thus, the teaching of *zài yòu* is given to prevent the transgressions of alteration and corruption. If one does not let nature be at ease, one fears that things will become corrupt and lose their nature. If one does not *yòu* them, one fears that they will imitate others and their virtue will change.

【III】
◎ Annotation: Without governance, there is no alteration or corruption.
◎ Subcommentary: When nature is upright and virtue is settled, why trouble with the administration of government? Having governance is not as good as having none; having action is not as good as having none.

◎ *Shiwen*: *Yǒu zhì tiānxià zhě zāi* (有治天下者哉): Cui’s edition reads *yǒu zhì tiānxià zhě cái shī* (有治天下者材失), with a note: "To govern forcibly is to fail in one’s capacity."

【IV】
◎ Annotation: Though Yao *zài yòu*-ed the world, his traces were those of governance. Though governance and chaos differ, in their loss of the world’s *tián* and *yú*, in making things vie for esteem and fear contempt, and in their lack of self-attainment, they are the same. Thus, to praise Yao and blame Jie is not as good as forgetting both.

◎ Subcommentary: *Tián* means stillness; *yú*, joy. *Cuì* means sorrow. Yao ruled the people with virtue, and the people sang and played *jirang*, yet this violated their still nature. Jie harmed things with cruelty, and things suffered sorrow and exhaustion, violating their joyful nature. Though the governance of Yao and Jie differed, in causing things to lose their nature, they were equal.

◎ *Shiwen*: *Rén lè* (人乐): *lè* is read as *luò* (洛). *Tián* (恬): read as *túqiān* (徒谦). *Cuìcuì* (瘁瘁): read as *zàijì* (在季), meaning illness. The *Guangya* says: sorrow. Cui’s edition reads *zuì* (醉). *Yú* (愉): read as *yú* (瑜); Xu reads it as *yù* (喻). *Gù yù* (故誉): read as *yú* (余).

【V】
◎ Annotation: Only when there is *tián* and *yú* with self-attainment can there be long endurance.
◎ Subcommentary: Yao made the people not *tián*, and Jie made them not *yú*, neither accorded with the pure and harmonious nature. If one seeks long endurance, there has never been such a thing in the world. Is great joy not excessive? It aids the yang. Is great anger not excessive? It aids the yin. When yin and yang are both aided, the seasons do not arrive on time, the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved, and does this not instead harm man’s form?

If man’s joy and anger lose their proper place, if his dwelling is without constancy, if his thoughts and considerations do not attain self-mastery, if his way is not brought to completion—then the world begins to become twisted, perverse, aloof, and fierce, and afterward there arise the conduct of Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen and Shi Yu. Thus, to reward the good of the whole world is insufficient, and to punish the evil of the whole world is not enough. Therefore, the greatness of the world is insufficient for reward and punishment.

From the Three Dynasties onward, they have been clamorous, taking reward and punishment as their constant task—when do they have leisure to settle the feelings of their nature and destiny?

【I】
◎ Subcommentary: *Pí* means to aid. Joy arises from the *hún*; anger, from the *pò*. Man is endowed with yin and yang and shares the same *qi* as the Two Modes. Yao made the hundred clans joyful, aiding the yang’s warmth and ease; Jie made the people angry, assisting the yin’s gloom and severity. When man’s joy and anger exceed their measure, heaven loses its constancy: the height of summer is not hot, the depths of winter have no frost. Having lost harmonious *qi*, and with heavenly disasters added, people suffer many illnesses—is this not instead harming the form? One must not act or establish laws, for it will inevitably lead to injury.

【Exegesis】
*《毗于》* is read as written. Sima [Biao] says: "to aid." Another gloss: "to combine." ◎ Yu Yue notes: The *Exegesis* reads *pí* as written, and Sima says "to aid," with another gloss "to combine." Yet the following text states, "yin and yang combine in *pí*, the four seasons fail to arrive, and the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved"—thus the gloss "to aid" is already untenable, and if taken as "to combine," it is even more mistaken. This *pí* should be read as *píliú* (violent joy). The *Er Ya*’s *Exegesis of Terms* states: "*Píliú* means violent joy." When spoken together, it is *píliú*; when separated, it may be shortened to *liú*, as in the *Poem* "Sang Rou": "they pluck and gather its *liú*." Or it may be shortened to *pí*, as in the present text: "*pí* to yang, *pí* to yin." *Bàolè* (violent joy) is rendered by Mao’s commentary as *bàoshuò* (scorching). Zheng’s annotation says: "When plucked and gathered, it becomes scorched and sparse." Thus *bàoshuò* means "to peel and fall." Joy pertains to yang; anger, to yin. Hence excessive joy harms yang, and excessive anger harms yin. "*Pí* to yin, *pí* to yang" means to harm the harmony of yin and yang, so the four seasons fail to arrive, and the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved. If one follows Sima’s gloss of *pí* as "to aid," the next three sentences become incoherent. The *Huainanzi*’s "Original Dao" chapter states: "Great anger ruptures yin; great joy topples yang"—this is precisely the same meaning.

【II】
◎ Annotation: These are all like Yao and Jie, causing things’ joy and anger to exceed their measure and thus leading to such calamities. Man, situated between heaven and earth, is most capable of disturbing the multitude of beings and agitating yin and yang through the spiritual awareness of joy and anger. Thus, between gain and loss, when joy and anger gather in the hearts of the hundred clans, the harmony of cold and heat is ruined, the seasons’ rhythms are disrupted, the hundred norms fall into chaos, and the myriad affairs collapse.

◎ Subcommentary: By clinging to joy and anger, the hundred clans’ deliberations lose their truth. Once they deviate from the model of the law, this is ruin indeed.

【Exegesis】
*《思虑》* is read *sīlǜ* (deliberations). *《大过》* is read *tà* (excess).

【III】
◎ Annotation: Longing for reward gives rise to goodness, so rewards cannot suffice.

【Exegesis】
*《乔》* is read *xiāo* by Xiang, *qiāoyāo* by Guo, and *jiāo* by Li. *《诘》* is read *qì* by Li and *qǐliè* by Xu. Cui says: "*Qiáojié* means discontent." *《卓》* is read *chuò* by Guo, *dīngjiǎo* by Xiang. *《鸷》* is read *chì* by Li, *zhūlì* by Xiang, and *chìlì* by another. Cui says: "*Zhuōzhì* means unruly conduct." *《之行》* is read *zhīxíng*.

【IV】
◎ Annotation: Fearing punishment brings cessation, so punishments cannot prevail.

◎ Subcommentary: *Qiáo* means deceit and falsity; *jié*, reproach and interrogation; *zhuó*, aloofness; *zhì*, ferocity. Thus, they become deceitful and reproachful, aloof and unyielding, harboring ferocity and arrogance, lightly overpowering others. Beginning with Yao, followed by the evil of Robber Zhi and the goodness of Zeng and Shi, once good and evil are manifest, rewards and punishments are tied to them. Longing for reward, they do good; fearing punishment, they cease evil. Yet the axes of the world are insufficient to punish evil, and the treasuries of the cosmos are insufficient to reward good. *Jǐ* means "to suffice."

【Exegesis】
*《能胜》* is read *néngshèng* (to prevail).

【V】
◎ Subcommentary: If one forgets rewards and punishments, natural truth suffices.

【VI】
◎ Annotation: Forgetting rewards and punishments to be naturally good—only then is one’s nature and destiny greatly sufficient. Rewards and punishments are how the sage-kings address merit and fault, not to manifest encouragement or deterrence. Thus, when governance reaches its perfection, they are abandoned, and only then can one return to unity. Yet from the Three Dynasties onward, they have followed these traces, clamoring and competing with them, ultimately taking what is entrusted as their task—when do they have leisure to settle the feelings of their nature and destiny?

◎ Subcommentary: *Xiōngxiōng* means clamor, the act of competing. Fearing the executioner’s axe and coveting the chariot and cap of office, their hearts harbor a hundred anxieties, and their affairs branch into myriad paths, clamoring and competing without cease. Since the Xia and Yin, this trend has gradually fanned into flame. Rewards and punishments entangle and disturb, leaving them frantically busy all day—how could they have leisure to settle their nature and destiny?

【Exegesis】
*《匈匈》* is read *xiōngxiōng*.

【Collation】
(1) The character *为* is deleted following *Zhuzi Pingyi*.
(2) The Zhao Jianyi edition has *失* as *夭*; the Shidetang edition has *失*.

Moreover, is it delight in beauty? This is indulgence in sensuality. Is it delight in keen hearing? This is indulgence in sound. 【I】 Is it delight in benevolence? This is disorder in virtue. Is it delight in righteousness? This is perversion of principle. 【II】 Is it delight in ritual? This is competition in technique. Is it delight in music? This is competition in excess. 【III】 Is it delight in sagacity? This is competition in artifice. Is it delight in knowledge? This is competition in fault. 【IV】 If the world seeks to settle the feelings of its nature and destiny, these eight may exist or not—it matters not. 【V】 If the world does not seek to settle the feelings of its nature and destiny, these eight begin to shred, crumple, and entangle, throwing the world into chaos. 【VI】 Yet the world begins to revere and cherish them—how deeply deluded the world is! 【VII】 Is it merely a matter of error to be discarded? They fast and purify themselves to speak of them, kneel and sit to present them, drum and sing to extol them—what have I to do with such things? 【VIII】

【I】
◎ Subcommentary: *Yuè* means attachment. *Yín* means clinging. Longing for Li and yearning for Kuang, they become mired in sound and sensuality.

【Exegesis】
*《而且》* is read as written or *zǐyú* by Xu. *《说明》* is read *yuè* (delight), the same below.

【II】
◎ Subcommentary: Virtue knows no hatred or love; partial love disrupts virtue. The Dao knows no right or wrong; imposing wrongness violates the Dao. *Bèi* means opposition.

【Exegesis】
*《是悖》* is read *bìnèi* by Xu, or *púmò* in another pronunciation.

【III】
◎ Subcommentary: Ritual consists of raising hands, kneeling, and bowing—its forms rise and fall in gradation. Music consists of *Xiánchí* and *Dàxià*, its pitch-pipes and eight timbres. Delighting in ritual only aids superficial skills; loving music further fosters the excess of palace tones and lewd sounds.

【Exegesis】
*《是相》* is read *xīliàng*, meaning "to assist." The same applies below and in the commentary.
*《于技》* is read *qǐ* by Ji, or *qí* by Li. Cui’s reading is the same, glossing it as "improper."

【IV】
◎ Commentary: When aligned with the Dao, there is no delight; delight in it brings the calamity of excess and opposition. *Xiāng* means "to assist."

◎ Subcommentary: Delighting in sagely traces assists the world’s arts; loving schemes and calculations exacerbates the blemishes of right and wrong.

【Exegesis】
*《说知》* is read *zhì*.
*《于疵》* is read *jīsī*.

【V】
◎ Commentary: Existence and extinction have no fixed abode; entrusting oneself to the portion one has received, then one’s nature and destiny are at peace.

◎ Subcommentary: The eight are: acuity, discernment, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, sageliness, and wisdom. It is said that people receive different portions, their natures and dispositions each distinct. Those like Li Kuang, Pang Degong, Zengzi, and Shi Yu, who possess these by their original portion, may preserve them; the multitude, whose nature and portion fundamentally lack them, vainly emulate and stray from authenticity—it is fitting that they let them go.

【VI】
◎ Commentary: To insist on preserving these eight is to be unable to follow nature freely, thus becoming like minced meat, coiled and cramped.

◎ Subcommentary: *Luǎnjuǎn* describes a posture that does not unfold or relax. *Cāngnáng* depicts haste. All beings under heaven, knowing only what lies beyond their portion, cannot rest in what is given, coil themselves in self-constraint, vie in ostentatious human affairs, hasten in competition, and chase after things—all because they do not forget the eight, leading to such corruption.

【Exegesis】
*《脔》* is read *lìzhuǎn*. Cui’s version writes it as *栾*.
*《卷》* is read *juǎnmiǎn*; Xu reads it *jūrǔan*. Sima states: *Luǎnjuǎn* depicts a state of not extending or relaxing. Cui concurs. Another gloss: "to pull and drag one another."
*《獊》* is read *cāng*. Cui’s version writes it as *戕*.
*《囊》* is read as written. Cui states: *Qiāngnáng* is like *qiāngrǎng*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern editions write *獊* as *怆*.

【VII】
◎ Commentary: Not being able to relinquish them is already an error. To then exalt and revere them as precious—how can this not be utter delusion?

◎ Subcommentary: The previous eight disorder the warp of the world; not being able to forget them is already great confusion. To then honor and esteem them as models—how grievous this is!

【Exegesis】
*《乃复》* is read *fúyòu*.

【VIII】
◎ Commentary: It is not merely that they pass away like temporary lodgings—rather, they are treasured and valued to such an extent.

◎ Subcommentary: The meaning of the eight principles is like that of straw dogs: once past, they ought not be retrieved. Yet in earnest prohibition and solemn purification, with formal declarations of ritual propriety, rulers and ministers kneel and sit, presenting offerings to one another, striking up the songs of *Jiǔsháo*, dancing the measures of *Dàzhāng*. To prize and esteem a thatched hut so highly—Zhuangzi witnessed this and could do nothing.

【Exegesis】
*《而去》* is read *qǐlǜ*.
*《之邪》* in Cui’s edition, only this character is written as *邪*; all others write it *咫*.
*《齐戒》* is also written *斋*, both read *zhāijiè*.
*《跪》* is read *qíguǐ*; Guo reads it *wēi*.
【Collation】
(1) The character *邪* is amended following the Shide Tang edition.
(2) The Shide Tang edition writes *怆*, with the same note. Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *伧*.

Thus, when the noble person must perforce govern the world, there is nothing better than non-action. Through non-action, the sentiments of one’s nature and destiny are then at peace.

【I】
Therefore, one who values one’s person over governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes one’s person over governing the world may be charged with the world.

【II】
◎ Commentary: If one lightly regards one’s person to pursue gain, abandoning oneself to chase after things, then one’s person cannot even be at peace—what can one do for the world?

◎ Subcommentary: Valuing one’s person over profit, placing oneself within and things without, preserving and cherishing one’s spirit, not dissipating it in the world—such a one may be entrusted to sit above the ten thousand things and transform the world.

【III】
◎ Commentary: To unravel or display them is to harm them.

◎ Subcommentary: The five viscera are the abode of essence and spirit; acuity and discernment are the functions of the ears and eyes. If one distinguishes the sentiments and perceptions of the five viscera and flaunts the functions of acuity and discernment, then the spirit gallops within, and the ears and eyes are exhausted without.

【Exegesis】
*《无解》* is read as written; another reading is *xiè*, meaning "to scatter."

【IV】
◎ Commentary: In movement and stillness, silence and speech, one constantly lacks any deliberate intention, entrusting all to nature.

◎ Subcommentary: The sage is as still as a corpse in quiescence, as dynamic as a flying dragon in activity—how could there be any distinction between quiescence and activity, principle and teaching? Thus, in stillness there is movement: still as a corpse, yet a dragon appears; silent as an abyss, yet thunder resounds. This illustrates that stillness is movement, movement is stillness; principle is teaching, teaching is principle—they are not two.

【Exegesis】
*《龙见》* is read *xiànbiàn*. Xiang’s edition writes it *睍*; Xiang reads it *xiàn*, while Cui reads it *睍*.

【V】
◎ Commentary: The spirit moves in accord with things; heaven follows the Dao in its course.

◎ Subcommentary: The spirit, as spoken of in its wondrous relation to the ten thousand things, is both dynamic and quiescent, its power equal to the azure sky, following and nurturing living things.
◎ Jia Shifu states: Still as a corpse, yet a dragon appears—unseen, yet manifest; silent as an abyss, yet thunder resounds—unmoving, yet transformed; the spirit moves and heaven follows—non-action yet accomplishment.

【VI】
◎ Commentary: Like motes of dust moving of themselves.

【Subcommentary】*Lei* means dust. Unhurried and at ease, free and unforced, in emptiness and tranquility—like the wind stirring fine dust, akin to floating things in the void, the yang *qi* drifting lightly, following its course and lingering as it wills.

【Exegesis】*Cóngróng*: read as *qīróng*. *Chuī*: read as *chāngshuì*, also *chāngguī*. Some editions write it as *吹*, same meaning. *Lèi*: read as *lièwěi*. Sima explains: *chuīlèi* is like rising movement. Xiang and Guo say: like motes of dust moving of themselves.

【VII】
◎ Commentary: Let it be as it is by nature.

◎ Subcommentary: Self and things merge indistinguishably, all in accord with nature—why trouble with effort or leisure to impose further governance? Cui Qu asked Lao Dan: “If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?” Lao Dan replied: “Take care not to disturb the human heart. The human heart pushes downward yet strives upward; up and down it is imprisoned and tormented. Soft and yielding, it yet overcomes the hard and strong. Sharpened and carved, it burns like scorching fire, freezes like congealing ice. Swift as a nod, it twice touches the ends of the four seas. At rest, it is deep and still; in motion, it hangs high as heaven. Proud and unruly, it cannot be tethered—is this not the human heart alone?”

【I】
◎ Commentary: To disturb it harms its innate goodness.

◎ Subcommentary: Cui Qu, surname Cui, given name Qu, origin unknown. Having asked, “If one leaves the heart in freedom without governance, how can goodness be realized?” The reply: “Leave it free and let it be—it will naturally accord with principle. To impose laws and regulate things disturbs the human heart.” The discussion of the human heart follows below.

【Exegesis】*Cuī Qū*: Xiang’s edition writes it as *臞*. *Qū*: read as *qiúzhū*. Cui Qu is a person’s name. *Lǎo Dān*: read as *tǔlán*. *Nǚ shèn*: read as *rǔ shèn*. *Yīng*: read as *yúyíng*, also *yúyìng*. Sima explains: to pull. Cui explains: to entangle.

【II】
◎ Commentary: Push it and it sinks; urge it and it rises—so easily swayed.

◎ Subcommentary: The human heart pushes others down and elevates itself—this is common sentiment.

【Exegesis】*Pái*: read as *píjiē*. Cui’s edition writes it as *俳*. *Jìn shàng*: read as *shízhǎng*. Same in the commentary below. *Qí yì*: read as *yǐchǐ*.

【III】
◎ Commentary: Without pushing or urging, it remains secure.

◎ Subcommentary: The heart, drowned in up and down, is led by circumstances like a prisoner in bonds, tormented by vexation.

【Exegesis】*Qiú shā*: read as written, or *xú suǒlì*. Meaning it imprisons and destroys the ten thousand things. ◎ Jia Shifu states: “Up and down, imprisoned and killed”—this means deceivingly high and deceivingly low, constraining the heart so it is bound and slain, unable to find its own ease. *Nào yuē* is forced compliance, so the hard may be made soft; *lián guì* is directness, yet cold and heat shift endlessly, water and fire both applied—disturb it and it becomes uncontrollable. Guo Xiang’s commentary may be in error.

【IV】
◎ Commentary: To be soft and yielding is to make the hard and strong compliant.

◎ Subcommentary: *Nào yuē* means soft and weak. Forcing one’s nature to act with softness and weakness aims to subdue the hard and strong.

【Exegesis】*Nào*: read as *chānglüè*, also *zhíjué*.

【V】
◎ Commentary: Scorching fire and congealing ice arise from the accumulation of joy and anger. If one does not carve or polish, preserving one’s original simplicity, where would there be ice or embers?

◎ Subcommentary: *Lián* means pursuing fame. *Guì* means harm. Carving and polishing one’s reputation and conduct seeks to surpass others. If one acts against nature in anger, the cold becomes as severe as congealing ice; if one follows desire in joy, the heat surpasses scorching fire.

【Exegesis】*Liánguì*: read as *jūwèi*. Sima [Biao] says: harm. *Guǎngyǎ* says: sharp. *Zhuó*: read as *dīngjué*.

【VI】
◎ Commentary: What custom stirs.

◎ Subcommentary: The mind that chases external realms traverses the ten directions in a single thought—how much more in the span of a bow and a glance, does it not repeatedly overlook the four seas!

【VII】
◎ Commentary: Stillness may be made like an abyss; movement then binds to heaven and leaps.

◎ Subcommentary: The desiring mind has no fixed standard for departure. When it happens to be still, it is like flowing water encountering a deep pool; when it touches the external and stirs, it resembles the high heavens suspended—unceasing in its movement, it binds to heaven and leaps.

【Exegesis】*Xuán ér tiān*: read as *xuán*. The *Xiàng* edition lacks the character *ér*, explaining: aspiring to the lofty and admiring the distant, hence called "binding to heaven."

◎ Commentary: The transformations of the human mind know no bounds. If one follows and releases it, it becomes still and naturally penetrates; if one governs and restrains it, it becomes strained and haughty. Haughtiness is an uncontrollable force.

◎ Subcommentary: Driving down and elevating up, beauty and ugliness, joy and anger—haughty eruptions and arrogant pride cannot be restrained: does this not lie in the human mind?

【Exegesis】*Fèn*: read as *fěnwèn* in the *Xiàng* edition. *Guǎngyǎ* says: stiff. Guo [Pu] reads it as *bēn*. *Jiāo*: as written, or read as *jūbiǎo*. Guo [Pu] says: haughtiness is an uncontrollable force.

【Collation】(1) The *Shìdétáng* edition writes *zàng* as *cáng*. (2) The *Shìdétáng* edition lacks the character *zì*.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to disturb the human mind.【1】Thereupon, Yao and Shun’s thighs grew no flesh, and their shins no hair, as they nurtured the forms of the world. They wearied their five viscera for benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and qi to model laws and standards. Yet there were still those they could not overcome.【2】Thus, Yao banished Huān Dōu to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei, and sent Gong Gong to Youdu—these were the ones who could not be overcome by the world.【3】By the time this extended to the Three Kings, the world was greatly alarmed.【4】Below were Jie and Robber Zhi; above were Zeng [Can] and Shi [Qiu];【5】and the Confucians and Mohists all arose.【6】Thereupon, joy and anger suspected one another;【7】the foolish and the wise deceived one another;【8】the good and the bad condemned one another;【9】the extravagant and the truthful mocked one another.【10】And the world declined.【11】Great virtue diverged, and the nature and mandate dissolved into chaos.【12】The world delighted in knowledge, and the common people exhausted themselves in pursuit.【13】Thereupon, axes and saws were fashioned, inked cords were used to kill, and hammers and chisels decided matters.【14】The world was sharply and utterly disordered; the fault lay in disturbing the human mind. Thus, the worthy concealed themselves beneath the cliffs of great mountains, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with anxiety in their ancestral halls.【15】

◎ Commentary: The Yellow Emperor did not act for benevolence and righteousness; he simply merged with things, and the traces of benevolence and righteousness appeared of themselves. Once these traces appeared, the minds of later ages necessarily followed them—this was also the Yellow Emperor’s traces disturbing things.

◎ Subcommentary: The Yellow Emperor established standards in accord with what was fitting, lovingly nurturing the people. In truth, this differed from the partiality of benevolence and the restraint of righteousness. Later kings adhered to his tracks, and the common people named him a sage. The disturbance of the human mind began here. The corruption arose with later kings; the blame does not lie with the Yellow Emperor.

【Exegesis】*Zìxiàn*: read as *xiànbiàn*. The same below.

【2】◎ Subcommentary: *Bá* refers to the white flesh. Yao and Shun followed the traces of the Yellow Emperor, their minds and bodies emaciated and worn. Their thighs were gaunt, devoid of white flesh; their shins were bare, stripped of fine hair. They nurtured the world’s appearance and pacified the dispositions of the myriad things. Their five viscera were consumed with sorrow within, while their blood and qi maintained dignity without. They practiced benevolence and righteousness as their compass, established laws and measures as their models—yet still could not avoid banishing the wicked clans, for there were matters they could not overcome.

◎ *Exegesis*: *Gǔ* is pronounced *gǔ*. The base of the shin is called the thigh. *Bá*: *pànmò* or *xiàngfùmò* in fanqie. Li [Yi] reads it as *fúgài*, explaining it as "white flesh." Some say the character should be *fú* (蔽膝, apron). Cui [Yuan] says: *bá* means □. *Jìng*: *xíngdìng* in fanqie. ◎ Qing Fan’s note: "To dignify their blood and qi" is akin to Mencius’ "toil their minds." *Jīn* means "toil," as glossed in the *Erya*’s *Shi Yan* chapter.

【3】◎ Subcommentary: Formerly, the Lord of Grand Swelling had an unworthy son, whom the world called Hundun—this was Huan Dou. He allied with Gonggong and was banished to the southern wilds. The Lord of Red Cloud had an unworthy son, whom the world called Taotie—this was San Miao. He was a vassal of Yao and enfeoffed with the state of San Miao, located to the left of Dongting Lake and the right of Poyang Lake, in Yuzhang, near Mount Heng. The Three Peaks were mountain names in the western wilds, in the land of the Qiang tribes west of Qinzhou. The Shaohao clan had an unworthy son, whom the world called Qiongqi—this was Gonggong. He served as Yao’s minister of waterworks. Youdu lay in the north—this was the land of Youzhou. The *Book of Documents* records the execution of Gun, but this text does not elaborate. These four men all harbored malice and defied Yao’s transformation, so they were exiled to the four wilds. This shows that Yao could not overcome the affairs of the world. Though the banishment of the Four Fiends was carried out by Shun, it is attributed to Yao here because Shun was then acting as Yao’s regent.

◎ *Exegesis*: *Huān*: pronounced *huān*. *Dōu*: *dīnghóu* in fanqie. *Chongshan*: in the southern wilds. In the sixtieth year of Yao’s reign, Huan Dou was exiled to Mount Chong. *Banishing San Miao*: In Cui’s edition, *banish* is written as *kill*; the *Book of Documents* has *exile*. San Miao was the son of the Lord of Red Cloud, i.e., Taotie. *Three Peaks*: pronounced *wēi*; also written as 危. The Three Peaks were mountains in the western wilds, now part of Tianshui. In the sixty-sixth year of Yao’s reign, San Miao was exiled to the Three Peaks. *Gonggong*: pronounced *gōng*. Gonggong was an official title, i.e., Qiongqi. *Youdu*: Li [Yi] says this was Youzhou, in the northern wilds. The *Book of Documents* has Youzhou. In the sixty-fourth year of Yao’s reign, Gonggong was banished to Youzhou.

【4】◎ Commentary: The names of Yao and Shun as emperors and kings are but their traces. I lodge in these traces, yet the traces are not me—thus the world is startled of itself. The more startled the world grows, the coarser the traces become. Coarseness and subtlety are but the levelness or ruggedness of the path; does the traveler ever change his feet? Thus the sage is one, yet there are differences among Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu. To clarify these differences: they are but names of the times, insufficient to name the sage’s reality. Therefore, Yao and Shun—were they merely one Yao and one Shun? Though they bore the appearance of toil and sorrow and the traces of benevolence and righteousness, what underlay those traces remained whole.

◎ Subcommentary: *Shī* means "to extend." From the Yellow Emperor to Yao and Shun, the sagely traces stagnated, and things grew disordered. This disorder extended to the Three Kings, and the alarm grew even greater.

◎ *Exegesis*: *Shī jí*: *yǐzhì* in fanqie. Cui [Yuan] says it means "to extend." *Dà hài*: *hài* means "alarm." *Yù cū*: pronounced *cū*; same below.

【5】◎ Subcommentary: Jie and Zhi practiced the conduct of petty men as their lowest standard, while Zeng and Shi practiced the conduct of gentlemen as their highest.

【6】◎ Subcommentary: The Ru and Mohists clung to traces, and from this, disputes over right and wrong arose.

【7】◎ Subcommentary: What one loves, another hates; their doubts and divisions multiply.

【8】◎ Subcommentary: They adorn their wisdom to startle the foolish, deceiving and humiliating one another.

◎ *Exegesis*: *Yú zhì*: pronounced *zhì*; same in the commentary below.

【9】◎ Subcommentary: Good and not good, each side condemns the other.

【10】◎ Subcommentary: They fabricate falsehoods and trust in truth, mocking and ridiculing one another.

【11】◎ Commentary: None could equal the self-sufficiency of the inner.

◎ Subcommentary: The entanglements persisted, and the cosmos declined.

【12】◎ Commentary: They established minor distinctions and did not rest in division.

◎ Subcommentary: Joy and anger, right and wrong flared up in great tumult. Thus the heavenly years were cut short, and natures and lives scattered in chaos. *Lànmàn* means "dispersed and disordered."

【13】◎ Commentary: Knowledge is boundless, yet they delighted in it—thus they had nothing to meet its demands.

◎ Subcommentary: The sage exhausted boundless knowledge; how could the common people not be drained?

◎ *Exegesis*: *Hào zhī*: *hūbào* in fanqie; same in the commentary.

【14】◎ Commentary: They carved and polished natures and lives, thus reaching this state.

◎ Subcommentary: The inked cord levels the crooked and straight of wood; rites and propriety show men degrees of honor and severity. The mallet and chisel bore holes in wood; punishments and laws sever men’s bodies and heads. Craftsmen wield axes and saws to mar timber; sages employ rites and laws to wound the Dao.

◎ *Exegesis*: *Jīn*: pronounced *jīn*, also written as 斤. *Jù*: pronounced *jù*. *Zhì yān*: axes and saws shape, as in mutilating punishments. *Shéngmò shā yān*: both read as written characters. Cui [Yuan] says: referring to execution by flogging. *Zhuī*: pronounced *zhuī*. *Záo*: pronounced *zuò*. *Jué yān*: pronounced *gǔxué* or *kǔxué*. Cui [Yuan] says: corporal punishments, hence the use of mallet and chisel.

【15】◎ Commentary: If one were to follow natural spontaneity and dwell in what is fitting, then worthy and foolish would follow their natures, noble and base would tread their proper stations, ruler and minister, high and low would all attain their ultimate norm—and the world would have no afflictions. Yet this course has entangled the hearts of the world, setting them galloping without cease. Thus, those of middling wisdom and below all outwardly adorn their natures to dazzle and delude the multitude, hating the upright and reviling the correct, drawing throngs of followers in their wake. Thereby, those who uphold authenticity lose their ground, while those who exalt falsity usurp their handle. Thus the lord is beset with cares above, and the people are distressed below.

【Exegesis】"Jiji" means trampling upon one another. Another interpretation holds that chaos arises—cosmic chaos—with blame lying in sagacity and knowledge. The Dao of the noble person wanes, and they conceal their traces in forests and marshes. Though the lord of men resides in the ancestral temple, his heart is ever anxious and trembling. Lacking worthy assistants, he fears the state may topple into peril.

【Pronunciation Notes】"脊脊" is pronounced *jiè* (音藉), with an alternate reading *zài yì* (在亦反), meaning "to trample upon." Originally written as "肴肴." *Guangya* states: "肴 means chaos." "大山" is pronounced *tài* (音泰), or may be read as written. "嵁" is pronounced *kū yán* (苦岩反), with alternate readings *kǔ xián* (苦咸反) or *kū yán* (苦严反). "岩" is pronounced *yán* (音严), with an alternate reading *yǔ xián* (语衔反), or *yán* (音岩), *yǔ xián* (语咸)〔反〕.

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current text reads "岩."

◎ Yu Yue states: In the *Pronunciation Notes*, "大山" is glossed as *tài* (音泰) but may also be read as written; the latter is correct. This refers generally to great mountains and is not necessarily Mount Tai of the Eastern Marchmount. "嵁" should be "湛." In the *Fengshan Wen* of the *Wen Xuan*, "湛恩鸿" is glossed by Li as "湛 means deep." "湛岩" thus means "deep crags," and since the context concerns mountains, the water radical was changed to the mountain radical. The text speaks of mountains as vast and crags as deep—these meanings correspond precisely. Scholars who fail to grasp this read "大" as *tài* (泰), which is erroneous. In the *Tian Zifang* chapter, "其神经乎大山而无介，入乎渊泉而不濡," the *Pronunciation Notes* gloss "大" as *tài* (泰), an error identical to this one. In the *Wen Xuan*'s *Feng Fu*, "缘泰山之阿," and the *Gushi* line "孤生竹，结根泰山阿," the wind’s path and the bamboo’s roots need not specifically refer to Mount Tai. The original text should read "大山" in both cases, referring generally to great mountains. Later readers misread it as *tài* (泰) and altered the text accordingly.

The *Yi Xuan* reads *xuán biàn* (玄遍) in reverse. The *Wu Zhi* reads *wū lù* (乌路). The *Fan Tu* is pronounced *fán* (烦).

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition writes *dà* (大) as *tài* (太).
(2) The Zhao edition omits the character *hū* (乎).
(3) The character *dīng* (丁) is amended following the Shide Tang edition and the original *Shiwen* text.
(4) The Shide Tang edition writes *ér* (而) as *tiān* (天); the Zhao edition adds *tiān* (天) after *ér* (而).
(5) The Zhao edition writes *shèng* (圣) as *zhì* (至).
(6) The Shide Tang edition writes *ruò* (若) as *gù* (故).
(7) The Shide Tang edition omits the character *suì* (遂).
(8) The character *fǎn* (反) is amended following the Shide Tang edition and the original *Shiwen* text.
(9) The Shide Tang edition writes *yán* (岩); this text follows the *Shiwen* in emending it.

In the present age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another; those in cangues and pillories press shoulder to shoulder; and those subjected to punishment and execution stand in full view. Yet the Confucians and Mohists still stretch their legs and wave their arms amidst the fetters and shackles—how extreme is their delusion! How utterly shameless and devoid of shame they are!

I know not whether the wisdom of the sages does not in fact serve as the crossbeams and pegs of cangues and pillories, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not function as the chisels and tenons of fetters and shackles. How can one be certain that Zeng [zi] and Shi [yu] were not the first arrows in the quivers of Jie and Robber Zhi?

Thus it is said: “Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.”

The annotation states: "殊" means to be definitively sentenced to death. "桁杨" refers to restraints—devices that clamp the feet and neck, all called *hengyang*. During the Warring States period and the declining Zhou era, it was precisely the traces of sageliness that led to the branding and mutilation of the Five Punishments, filling the thoroughfares with *hengyang* and causing those sentenced to death to lie heaped upon one another, their mangled remains strewn across the roads. "Press shoulder to shoulder" and "stand in full view" make clear their multitude.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Shusi* (殊死) is read as written. The *Guangya* states: "殊" means "to sever." Sima [Biao] says: "to decide." Another gloss: "to execute." The *Zilin* says: "to die," as does the *Shuowen*. It further notes: The Han ordinance states, "When chieftains of the Man and Yi tribes commit crimes, they are to be *shu*-ed." Cui [Yuan] writes it as "夭死" (premature death). *Xiangzhen* (相枕) is read with the *zhen* rhyme. *Heng* (桁) is read with the *gang* rhyme. Sima [Biao] says: "a long foot restraint." *Yang* (杨) is pronounced *yang* as in "阳." Cui [Yuan] says: "Restraints that clamp the neck and shins are all called *hengyang*."

The commentary states: This calamity arises from the pedantic Confucians clinging to traces. They do not consider abandoning traces to return to the One, but instead wave their arms, employing traces to govern traces—truly, how extreme is their shamelessness and lack of shame!

The annotation explains: *Liqi* (离跂) describes the exertion of force. The traces of sageliness are tools that harm beings, yet the Confucians and Mohists still wave their arms and strain beyond bounds amidst the fetters and shackles, clinging to traces and sealing off teachings to remedy the ills of the age. How could such chaos ever reach its limit? Thus, the sigh is uttered: how utterly benighted and shameless they are!

The *Shiwen* notes: *Li* (离) is read with the *shi* or *zhi* rhyme. *Qi* (跂) is read with the *shi* or *chi* rhyme.

《攘》 is read with the *ryang* rhyme. 《桎》 with the *zhī shí* rhyme. 《梏》 with the *gǔ dú* rhyme.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Líqì* corresponds to the meaning in Xunzi’s *Rongru* chapter—“deviating from the norm and straining to criticize”—referring to setting oneself apart from the multitude.

《意》 is read as written, or alternatively with the *yī* sound. 《无愧》 in Cui’s edition appears as a lacuna. 《腐》 is read with the *fǔ* sound. 《方复》 with the *fú yòu* rhyme.

【Three】【Annotation】 The *héngyáng* uses *jiēxí* as its pins, while the *zhìgù* employs chiseled tenons for function. Sagely wisdom and benevolence-righteousness are traces far removed from transgression. When traces distance themselves from transgression, the people then esteem them; when esteemed, deceit and pretense arise. Once deceit and pretense arise, those without the implements to suppress villainy have never existed. Thus, abandoning what is esteemed prevents deceit from emerging; when deceit does not emerge, the *héngyáng* and *zhìgù* are abolished—what need then for chiseled tenons or *jiēxí*?

【Commentary】 *Jiēxí* are the wedges of restraints. *Záo* means “hole.” Inserting an object into a hole is called a *ruì*. Shackles without wedges are not secure; manacles without holes are useless. This is akin to governance: without sagely traces, no standards are established; without benevolence-righteousness, Jie and Zhi would not act. Sagely traces are the source of entanglement, while benevolence-righteousness is the root of harm.

【Pronunciation Notes】 《椄》 Li reads as written; Xiang and Xu read it as *qiè*. Guo and Li read 《槢》 as *xí*; Xiang and Xu read it as *tuó xiè*. Sima explains: *Jiēxí* are the wedges of restraints. Pronounced with the *xī jié* rhyme. Cui’s edition has a lacuna, noting it may be read as *dié* or written as *xí*. *Jiēxí* are the beams of fetters. The *Huainanzi* states: “The large ones are pillars and beams; the small ones are *jiēxí*.”
◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Wenxuan* commentary on He Yan’s *Jingfu Palace Rhapsody* cites Sima: “*Xí* are the wedges of restraints,” differing from the *Pronunciation Notes*. (The *Pronunciation Notes* include *jiē* before *xí* and omit *yě* after *xiè*.)

《凿》 reads *zào* in the Luoyang pronunciation, and also *zào* in the Baofu pronunciation. 《枘》 reads *ruì* in the Renrui pronunciation. Xiang’s edition writes it as *内*, with the same sound. The *San Cang* states: it is the tenon at the top of a pillar. The mortise at the head of a tenon fits into the wood like the tenon at the top of a pillar.

《远于》 reads *yú* as *yuàn*, with the same pronunciation below. 《而御》 reads *yù* in the Yulü pronunciation. The original text also writes it as *御*, with the same sound.

【Note】 *Hāo shǐ* are the fiercest of arrows, implying that Zeng [Can] and Shi [Qiu] serve as tools for Jie and Zhi.

【Subcommentary】 *Hāo* refers to the roaring sound of an arrowhead. Sagely wisdom is the instrument of usurping the state, while benevolence and righteousness are the resources of the violent. Zeng and Shi serve as the fierce arrows of Jie and Zhi, hence the statement.

【Pronunciation Notes】 《焉知》 reads *yān* as *yú*. 《嚆矢》 reads *hāo shǐ* in the Xujiao pronunciation. The original text also writes it as *嗃*. Xiang explains: *hāo shǐ* are arrows that whistle. Guo states: they are the fiercest of arrows. The *Zilin* says: *hāo* means a great cry. Cui’s edition writes it as *蒿*, explaining: mugwort can be made into arrows. It may also be written as *矫*, where *矫* means *sào* (clamor). Cui’s edition includes an additional twenty-four characters below this: *"If the mutual generation of being and non-being is so extreme, then Zeng and Shi and Jie and Zhi generate being and non-being—how could they not collide?"*

【Note】 Remove what causes entanglement.

【Subcommentary】 Abandon the instruments of usurpation and discard the resources of violence, and the world will be at peace—this is called great governance.

【Pronunciation Notes】 《大治》 reads *dà* as *zhì*. 《去其》 reads *qù* in the Qilü pronunciation.

【Collation Notes】
(1) The Shidetang edition writes *思*; Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *斯*.
(2) Zhao’s edition writes *矫* as *骄*.
(3) The Shidetang edition writes *奸*.
(4) The character *妾* is amended following the Shidetang edition; the original *Pronunciation Notes* also mistakenly wrote *燮*.

After ruling as the Son of Heaven for nineteen years, the Yellow Emperor’s decrees reached all under heaven. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelled on Mount Kongtong, he went to see him and said: “I have heard that you, Master, have attained the ultimate Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the ultimate Dao? I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate yin and yang to nurture all living things. How should this be done?”

【Collation Notes】
(1) The character *山* is amended following the *Quewu* edition’s citation of Zhang Junfang’s text and the *Chengshu* commentary.

【Commentary】
(1) The virtue of his transformation and decrees spread widely throughout the realm.
(2) Mount Kongtong lies on the northern border of Liangzhou. Guangcheng is another name for Laozi.
【Pronunciation Notes】
*Guangchengzi*: Some say this is Laozi.
*Kongtong*: Sima [Biao] says: the mountain beneath the Northern Dipper. The *Erya* states: "That which bears the Dipper’s pole is called Kongtong." Another account places it thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liangguo.
(3) The five grains are millet, glutinous millet, beans, hemp, and wheat. He wished to draw upon the profound principles of the Way, the essential qi of heaven and earth and yin and yang, to aid the growth of the five grains and nourish the people.
(4) *Suì* means "to accord." He wished to model the regulation of yin and yang by establishing offices and dividing duties, thereby harmonizing with the natures of all living things, and asked how this might be achieved.

Guangchengzi said: “What you wish to inquire about concerns the substance of things; what you wish to regulate concerns the ruin of things. Since you began to govern all under heaven, clouds have rained without gathering, grasses and trees have withered before turning yellow, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim. With a mind as narrow as that of a flatterer, how could you be fit to speak of the ultimate Dao?”

(1) *Annotation:* To inquire into the essence of the ultimate Dao may indeed be called "substance."
*Commentary:* 而 (*er*) means "you." Your wish to sow and cultivate the five grains and establish offices to regulate the two modes [of yin and yang]—what you ask is coarse and shallow, no more than physical form, far removed from the profound and mysterious. This is a rebuke.
*Exegesis:* 《質也》 (*Zhì yě*) The *Guangya* states: *zhi* means "correct."

(2) *Annotation:* To not allow things to be as they are of themselves but instead seek to regulate them is to ruin them.
*Commentary:* If you insist on establishing offices and dividing duties, compelling things to follow your will, you will violate the workings of creation and inevitably bring about harm and destruction.

(3) *Commentary:* 族 (*zú*) means "to gather." To appoint officials to manage yin and yang and govern all things with intent will surely invite calamity. Wind and rain will fall out of harmony, heat and cold lose their proper season; clouds will rain before gathering, leaves will fall while the trees are still green. Comets and eclipses will dim the three luminaries, human hearts will be disturbed, and the celestial patterns will grow desolate and perilous.
*Exegesis:* 《云氣不待族而雨》 Sima [Biao] says: *zú* means "to gather." Rain falls before clouds gather, indicating a scarcity of moisture.
《草木不待黃而落》 Sima [Biao] says: This indicates an excess of killing *qi*.
The *Erya* states: *luò* means "to die."
《益以》 Cui [Zhuan] writes this as *gài yǐ*.

(4) *Commentary:* 翦翦 (*jiǎnjiǎn*) describes a narrow and inferior state. You are a flattering and obsequious man, your mind petty and shallow—how could you be fit to speak of the ultimate Dao!
*Exegesis:* 《佞人》 Read as written. Guo [Xiang] reads this as *níng*.
《翦翦》 Read as written. Guo [Xiang] and Sima [Biao] say: "skilled in debate." Another says: "the appearance of obsequiousness." Li [Yi] says: "a shallow and limited appearance." Another says: "a cramped and small appearance."

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and dwelled in seclusion for three months before returning to seek him out.

*Commentary:* The Yellow Emperor withdrew, purified his mind, relinquished the throne of the Nine-Five, built a solitary chamber to escape the clamor, spread white cogon grass to maintain purity, and dwelled in seclusion for a time before returning once more to seek the Dao. 邀 (*yāo*) means "to encounter."
*Exegesis:* 《捐》 Read as *yuàn*.
《閒居》 Read as *xián*. The annotation below is the same.
《復往》 Read as *fù wǎng*.
《邀之》 Read as *yāo zhī*, meaning "to seek."

Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from downwind, crawling forward on his knees, bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and asked: “I have heard that you, Master, have attained the ultimate Dao. I venture to ask: how should one cultivate the body so as to achieve longevity?”

Guangchengzi sprang to his feet and said: “An excellent question! Come!”

“I shall speak to you of the ultimate Dao. The essence of the ultimate Dao is profound and obscure; its utmost reaches are dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will naturally align itself. You must be still, you must be pure; do not weary your form, do not disturb your qi, and only then can you attain longevity. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your form—thus your form will endure. Guard your inner self, seal off the outer, for excessive knowledge brings ruin.

I shall lead you to the heights of great brightness, to the source of utmost yang; I shall guide you through the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin. Heaven and Earth have their offices, yin and yang their repositories; guard your body with care, and all things will naturally flourish. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony, and so I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.”

“[2] *Commentary*: ‘Profound obscurity’ and ‘silent darkness’ both signify utter nothingness. Why do Zhuangzi and Laozi repeatedly extol *wu* (non-being)? To clarify that what gives rise to things is no-thing, and things arise of themselves. They arise of themselves—not for the sake of arising—so how could there be any further action upon what has already arisen?

*Subcommentary*: The utmost Dao is subtle and imperceptible to the heart-mind; thus it is likened to profound obscurity, deep remoteness, silent darkness, and absolute mystery.

*Philological Notes*: 《吾语》: *yú jù* (rhyme). Below, same. 《女》: *rǔ*. Hereafter the same. 《窈窈》: *wū liǎo* (rhyme).

[3] *Commentary*: Forget seeing yet see of yourself; forget hearing yet hear of yourself—then the spirit will not be disturbed, and the form will not go awry.

*Subcommentary*: When the ears and eyes refrain from outward seeing and hearing, embracing and guarding the spirit, external conditions cannot confuse; heart-mind and form unite, and one naturally merges with the upright Dao.

*Philological Notes*: 《不邪》: *sì jiē* (rhyme).

[4] *Commentary*: Allowing it to move of itself, one remains at ease and still, never cut short.

*Subcommentary*: Purify the spirit and still the thoughts; the body knows no toil. Not clinging to external conditions, the spirit abides in constant stillness. The heart-mind is at leisure, the form at ease—thus one attains longevity and enduring vision.

[5] *Commentary*: All these follow nature in movement, hence longevity.

*Subcommentary*: Engage in seeing and hearing yet perceive nothing; the sense faculties and their objects are empty, the heart-mind likewise at peace. Illumination is free of knowing and deliberation; response to the moment remains ever still. The spirit, serene, guards the form—thus one may attain longevity and enduring vision.

[6] *Commentary*: Preserving one’s true nature.

*Subcommentary*: Forgetting the heart-mind preserves the true.

[7] *Commentary*: Guarding one’s allotted portion.

*Subcommentary*: Cutting off seeing and hearing, one guards one’s portion.

[8] *Commentary*: Knowledge without bounds brings ruin.

*Subcommentary*: Without caution in wisdom and thought, the heart-spirit is exhausted; ears and eyes are spent on externals—how could this not lead to ruin?

[9] *Commentary*: To reach the source of yin and yang is to emerge upon the heights of great brightness and enter the gate of profound obscurity.

*Subcommentary*: Yang is movement; yin is stillness. *Suì* means ‘to emerge.’ When the perfected one responds to movement, wisdom shines like the sun and moon—this is called ‘great brightness.’ The source of utmost yang traces the descent of manifestations from their origin, hence it is said to ‘emerge.’ When there is no stimulus, the root is profoundly still, congealed in tranquility—this is the source of utmost yin. It demonstrates the return of manifestations to their origin, hence it is called ‘entering the gate of profound obscurity.’ Guangcheng revealed to the Yellow Emperor both the principles of movement and stillness, thus employing the two gates of yin and yang.

*Philological Notes*: 《我为》: *yú wěi* (rhyme). Below, same.”

**Annotations and Text:**

[10] *Commentary*: Simply allow things to follow their course.

[11] *Subcommentary*: The "offices of Heaven" refer to the sun, moon, and stars, which illuminate the four directions and govern the myriad things—hence they are called "offices." The "offices of Earth" refer to metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, which sustain the movements of plants and animals and bear the multitude of beings—thus they too are called "offices." The two qi of yin and yang, along with the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each have their appointed functions, like the viscera and bowels. All things follow their nature without hindrance, perfectly attuned—why defy the transformations of creation by establishing further offices and bureaus? Woman, simply practice non-action, guard your body with care, and all the myriad things will naturally flourish. Why trouble your heart and bring sorrow upon yourself?

*Philological Notes*: 《物将自壮》 *cè liàng* (rhyme). This means that if one does not govern the world, all things will follow their own course and grow strong thereby.

[12] *Commentary*: It is a matter of fully realizing the utmost of one’s nature and destiny, attaining the ultimate of long life. Only when the body does not meet an untimely end can one extend care to others.

*Subcommentary*: Preserve tranquility and a unified mind, abide in the wondrous Dao of central harmony, cultivate and protect the body—though one may enjoy a long lifespan, there will never come a day of decline.

*Textual Note*: (1) The character *zhēn* (真) is amended according to the commentary.

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and said, "Guangchengzi is indeed like Heaven!"

[1] *Commentary*: Heaven is non-action.

*Subcommentary*: He praised the lofty purity of the sagely Dao, which may unite in virtue with the mysterious Heaven.

Guangchengzi said, "Come! I will tell you."

Those beings are without end, yet all people deem them finite;
Those beings are unfathomable, yet all people deem them bounded.

One who attains my Dao,
above becomes a sovereign, below a king.
One who loses my Dao,
above sees light, below becomes earth.

Now, the hundred flourishing things all arise from earth and return to earth.
Thus I shall leave you,
enter the gate of the boundless,
and wander the wilds of the infinite.

I share radiance with the sun and moon,
I am constant with Heaven and Earth.
Approach me—luminous!
Distance yourself—obscured!
All people will perish entirely,
yet I alone endure!"

Returning to the profound stillness of the root, entering the gate of the boundless;
responding to transformations between Heaven and Earth, wandering the wilds of the infinite.

Utterly yielding to them.

To partake is to be one—
sharing radiance with the three luminaries,
abiding as long as the two poles.
How could it be a mere twelve hundred years!

Things come and go,
yet none perceive it.

The sage, empty of mind as a mirror,
when the moment calls forth a response, answers in perfect accord;
if no stimulus comes, remains dim and obscure.

"Approach me—luminous!
Distance yourself—obscured!"
Whether turning toward or away,
all is met with the same unburdened heart.

Seeing life and death as one body,
there is nowhere that is not presence.

To unite life and death is to illuminate transformation—
nothing was ever not the self.
No going, no coming,
I alone endure.

People cling to life and death,
and so suffer distress.

Cloud General was traveling east,
passed the branch of the Whirlwind Tree,
and there by chance encountered Vast Vagueness.
Vast Vagueness was just then slapping his thigh and leaping about in play.
Cloud General saw him,
startled, halted,
and stood in astonishment, saying:
"Old sir, who are you?
Old sir, what are you doing?"

Li Yun: "Cloud General" means the commander of clouds.
*Fuyao*: *Fu* is also written as *fu*, pronounced *fu*. Li Yun: *Fuyao* is a divine tree, growing in the Eastern Sea. Another says: it is the wind.
◎ Qingfan’s note: *Chuxue Ji* 1 and *Taiping Yulan* 8 cite Sima [Biao] as saying: "Cloud General is the commander of clouds." *Shiwen* omits this.
*Hongmeng*: read as written. Sima [Biao] says: it is the primordial qi of nature. Another says: it is the qi above the sea.
*Fu*: *fufu* (反切), one reading *fu*. *Pi*: in some editions written as *bi* (髀), pronounced *bi*. Xu [Shen] reads *fubi* (反切), also *fudi* (反切).
*Que*: in some editions written as *jue* (爵), same meaning. Pronounced *jianglüe* (反切).
*Yue*: Sima [Biao] says: "sparrow-leaping," like a sparrow bathing. Another says: like a sparrow’s hopping.

[Annotation 2] The commentary explains: [Cloud General] marveled at [Vast Vagueness’s] appearance and bearing, so unlike the common, and his movements so extraordinary, that he asked the reason for his journey, hoping to learn the Way of governing things.

[Annotation 3] The commentary explains: *tang* is an expression of startled doubt. *Zhi* means unmoving. *Sou* is the name for an elder.
*Shiwen*: *Tang*: *chizhang* (反切), one reading *tulang* (反切), Li [Zhouhan] reads *tudang* (反切). Sima [Biao] says: it is the appearance of wanting to stop.

Li [Zhouhan] says: the appearance of being lost in oneself.
*Zhi*: *zhi’er* (反切), also *zhuli* (反切), or *yulie* (反切). Li [Zhouhan] says: the appearance of immobility.
*Sou*: in some editions written as □, *sukou* (反切), Guo [Xiang] reads *suzou* (反切). Sima [Biao] says: a term for elders.

[Collation] (1) Zhao the Remonstrator’s edition writes *pi que* as *bi jue*, the same below. (2) *Shenmu* follows the *Shiwen* emendation.

Hong Meng clapped his thigh and sparrow-leaped without ceasing, then turned to Cloud General and said, “Roam!”

[Annotation 1] To roam is to wander freely through the transformations of nature.

[Shiwen] *Bu chuo*: *dielie* (反切). Li [Zhouhan] says: to stop.

Cloud General said, “I wish to ask you something.”

Hong Meng looked up at Cloud General and said, “Hmph!”

Cloud General said, “The qi of Heaven is disharmonious, the qi of Earth is pent-up, the Six Qi are unbalanced, and the Four Seasons are out of order. Now I wish to blend the essence of the Six Qi to nurture all living things—how might I do this?”

[Annotation 1] The two qi neither descend nor ascend, thus pent-up.
[Shiwen] *Yue xu*: *kuangyu* (反切). Also written as *hu*. ◎ Qingfan notes: In the *Shiwen*, *xu* is also written as *hu*. *Hu xu* are interchangeable in ancient texts. The *Shuowen* says: *xu* is an exclamation of surprise. In the *Zuozhuan* of the first year of Duke Wen, “calling the laborers,” Du [Yu]’s commentary says: *hu* is an utterance. In the *Canon of Yao*, “the Emperor said *xu*,” the commentary says: *xu* is an expression of doubt and astonishment. An exclamation of surprise or doubt is also an utterance. In the *Tan Gong*, “startled, he said *hu*,” the *Shiwen* writes *hu* as *xu*. In the *Monthly Ordinances*, “the great *yu* sacrifice to the Emperor,” Zheng [Xuan]’s commentary says: *yu* is the sacrifice of sighing and calling for rain. In the *Rites of Zhou*, the *Subcommentary on Female Shamans* cites Dong Zhongshu: “*Yu* is the art of seeking rain, a song of sighing and calling.” All are examples of this.
*Yu jie*: read as written. Cui [Yuan]’s edition writes *wan*, pronounced *jie*.

[Annotation 2] Yin-yang, wind-rain, darkness-brightness—these are the Six Qi.
[Annotation 3] Spring, summer, autumn, winter—their seasonal order is disrupted and delayed.
[Annotation 4] I wish to blend the essence of the Six Qi to nourish the myriad beings, hence the question.

[Collation] (1) The character *yu* is supplied from the *Shuowen*.

Hong Meng clapped his thigh, sparrow-leaped, and shook his head, saying, “I do not know! I do not know!”

[Annotation 1]

[Annotation 1] All things receive their nature from the spontaneous; if one were to impose intention to govern them, it would surely contravene the workings of creation—hence his shaking of the head and refusal to answer.

*Shiwen*: *Diao* (掉) is read *tiao* (徒吊反).

Cloud General could obtain no answer. Three years later, he traveled east, passing through the wilds of Song, where he chanced upon Hong Meng. Cloud General rejoiced greatly, hastening forward and saying, “Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?” He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and entreated Hong Meng for instruction.

[Annotation 1] He revered him as he would Heaven; repeating “forgotten me” expressed his hope to recall their former encounter.

*Shiwen*: *You Song* (有宋) is read as written, the name of a state. The variant *zong* (宗) is incorrect.

Hong Meng said, “Wandering aimlessly, I know not what I seek; roaming wildly, I know not where I go. The traveler moves with restless urgency, observing what is without delusion. What do I know?”

The *Subcommentary* states: "Floating and wandering through the world entails no grasping or seizing."

[Annotation 2] *Zhu* notes: "And thus naturally attains what it seeks."
The *Subcommentary* states: "Moving without intent is aimless wandering, without fixed direction."

[Annotation 3] *Zhu* notes: "One who is inwardly sufficient finds all things self-correcting upon a mere glance."
The *Subcommentary* states: "Hong Meng’s roaming heart dwells in vastness; the things it encounters are manifold. The wisdom of observation knows that the realm it perceives is without delusion. *Yangzhang* means abundance."
*Shiwen*: *Yangzhang* is read *yu zhang* (于丈反). The *Mao Poetry Tradition* states: "*Yangzhang* means loss of composure." Here, however, it signifies self-attainment and correctness.

[Annotation 4] *Zhu* notes: "It is merely this."
The *Subcommentary* states: "Floating and wandering, unburdened in heart and yielding to things—each thing corrects itself, so what do I know?"

Cloud General said, "I myself believed I was acting wildly, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot escape the people, and now they imitate me. I wish to hear a single word."

[Annotation 1] *Zhu* notes: "Riding the natural course of things is not for the sake of leaving traces, yet traces manifest of themselves. Wildness is not for the sake of summoning the people, yet the people follow of themselves. Thus, one is compelled by the people’s imitation and cannot escape."
The *Subcommentary* states: "Like Hong Meng, I govern the world without intent. Unable to avoid overseeing the people, they follow my traces and are thus led by things to imitate me."
*Shiwen*: *Zhi fang* (之放) is read *fang wang* (方往反), meaning "imitation." The *Zhu* concurs.

[Annotation 2] The *Subcommentary* states: "I wish to hear the essential teaching, that my profound doubts may be resolved."

Hong Meng said, "To disorder the constant principles of Heaven and contravene the nature of things is to fail in the mysterious work of Heaven. To scatter the herds of beasts and cause birds to cry out at night; to bring calamity upon grasses and trees and disaster upon insects—this is the fault of governing people!"

[Annotation 1] *Zhu* notes: "If one follows the nature of things without governing, then natures are not contravened and principles are not disordered. The mysterious and silent work is accomplished, and the natural is attained."
The *Subcommentary* states: "To disorder the constant Dao of Heaven and contravene the true nature of things is to invite deceit and cunning, so that the transformations of the natural are not fulfilled."

[Annotation 2] *Zhu* notes: "Separated from their source of stillness."
The *Subcommentary* states: "When traces are imitated and manifest, harm to things arises: beasts are startled into scattering, and birds are frightened into crying out at night."

[Annotation 3] *Zhu* notes: "All sit and receive harm."
The *Subcommentary* states: "Grasses and trees wither before frost, and calamity befalls insects. *Kun* means brightness, referring to those that emerge toward the sun."
*Shiwen*: *Zhi chong* (止虫) is read as written. Some versions write *kun chong* (昆虫). Cui’s version writes *zheng chong* (正虫). *Jie zuo* (皆坐) is read *cai wo* (才卧反).

[Annotation 4] *Zhu* notes: "The traces of governance are the very source of disorder."
The *Subcommentary* states: "Where Heaven governs, things perish—this is the fault of governing people."
*Shiwen*: *Yi* (意) is read *yi* (医). Some versions write *yi* (噫). The same applies below.

The *Collation Notes* state:
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition writes *kun* (昆) in place of *zhi* (止).
(2) The Zhao edition writes *yi* (噫) for *yi* (意), and the same applies below.

Cloud General said, "In that case, what am I to do?"
[Annotation 1] *Subcommentary*: He wishes to request the art of non-governance.

Hong Meng replied, "*Yi*! How poisonous indeed!
[Annotation 1] *Zhu* notes: The fault of governing people runs deep.
*Subcommentary*:

「*Duo* (咄) is interchangeable with *chu* (黜). (In the *Xu Wugui* chapter, *chu qi yu* [黜耆欲] appears as *duo* in Sima Biao’s edition.) Wei Zhao’s commentary on the *Zhouyu* states: *Chu* means to dismiss. *Chu* and *duo* (堕) share similar meanings. In the *Great Master* chapter, *duo zhi ti, chu cong ming* (堕枝体，黜聪明) serves as evidence. In clerical script, the character *chu* (出) is sometimes abbreviated as *shi* (士) (as in *ao* [敖] abbreviated as *mai* [卖], or *kuan* [款] abbreviated as *mai* [卖]). Thus, *duo* (咄) may appear as □, and due to its resemblance to *tu* (吐), it was mistakenly written as such. (The corruption of *duo* into *tu* mirrors the corruption of *tu* into *duo*. In the *Book of Han*, *Bi wei e tu qi wo* [必畏恶吐弃我] appears in the *Han Ji* as *duo* instead of *tu*.) Yu Yue said: *Tu* should be *du* (杜), meaning to block or suppress one’s intelligence.

[Annotation 4] *Commentary*: Unbounded by things.
*Subcommentary*: *Mingxing* is the qi of spontaneity. When body and mind merge into vastness, they unite with the natural whole.
*Exegetical Notes*: *Xing* (涬) is pronounced *huding* or *xing*. *Ming* (溟) is pronounced *muding*. Sima Biao says: *Xingming* is the qi of spontaneity.

[Annotation 5] *Commentary*: Sitting in forgetfulness, embracing solitude.
*Subcommentary*: *Hun* refers to the pursuit of knowledge. *Jieshi* means to release and dissolve. *Moran* signifies ignorance; cleansing the mind until it resembles dead ashes or withered wood, devoid of conscious *hun*.

[Annotation 6] *Commentary*: Only by forgetting knowledge can one truly return.
*Subcommentary*: *Yunyun* denotes multiplicity. Amid the ceaseless flux of arising and ceasing, all remains rooted in spontaneity. How could one rely on knowledge to return to the root?

[Annotation 7] *Commentary*: Abiding in primordial chaos without knowledge, allowing spontaneous return, one remains forever united with the source.
*Subcommentary*: Dwelling in chaos without knowledge, embracing solitude, one traverses myriad transformations without departing from spontaneity.
*Exegetical Notes*: *Hunhun* (浑浑) is pronounced *hubun*. *Dundun* (沌沌) is pronounced *tubun*. *Buli* (不离) is pronounced *lizhi*. The same applies to the commentary below.

[Annotation 8] *Commentary*: To know and then return is to deviate from true return.
*Subcommentary*: Seeking the root through knowledge is to stray from the nature of spontaneity.

[Annotation 9] *Commentary*: Inquiry disrupts the spontaneity of life.
*Subcommentary*: The Dao transcends names and words; principle eludes thought and emotion. To question the Dao with names or peer into principle with emotions—how far removed is this! Only by relinquishing emotions and forgetting names, surrendering to spontaneous transformation, can things attain their natural vitality.
*Collation Notes*: The Shidetang edition writes *zhi* (知) in place of *zhi* (之).

Cloud General said, "Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me and shown me the Way of silence. Through personal cultivation, I have now attained it." He bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, rose, and departed.

[Annotation 1] *Commentary*: To know without silence is to perpetually lose oneself.

*Subcommentary*: Heaven has sent down words of virtue and demonstrated the practice of profound silence. From the moment I stood in this body, only now have I awakened.

Ordinary people delight in those who resemble themselves and despise those who differ.
[Annotation 1] *Subcommentary*: Those mired in habit and delusion grow accustomed to favoring the like-minded and resenting the unlike.
*Exegetical Notes*: *Er wu* (而恶) is pronounced *wulu*.

They desire conformity and reject difference because they seek to stand out from the crowd.
[Annotation 2] *Commentary*: Their heart aspires to rise above the multitude as an outstanding figure.
*Subcommentary*: To affirm oneself and negate others, to favor the like and despise the unlike, is to crave distinction and renown, striving to surpass the masses.
◎ Jia Shifu says: To stand out from the crowd is to surpass others in talent and wisdom, compelling all to submit. Yet how can one know whether it is oneself who stands out from the crowd or the crowd that stands out from oneself? Aligning with the crowd’s preferences—conforming where they conform, differing where they differ—one remains one of them. Thus, delighting in conformity and despising difference is merely another form of aligning with the crowd. Joy and anger arise not from oneself but from the crowd, yet one clings to them as one’s own—this is the root of confusion.

[Annotation 3] *Commentary*: Since all desire to stand out, they remain ordinary. If I, too, sought to stand out, I would differ from them in no way and could never surpass them. Only by never opposing the multitude in any regard can one truly transcend them and become their master.
*Subcommentary*: People’s hearts are set on competition and distinction, a base and common impulse. How can one rise above the crowd? Only by harmonizing with their dust and radiance can one truly stand apart as their paragon.

[Annotation 4] *Commentary*: My own knowledge is no match for the multitude’s skills; thus, relying on them brings peace. Without such reliance, the countless masses become my adversaries.
*Subcommentary*: Employing the skills of the multitude and deferring to their insights eliminates contention. This is what is meant by "the wise see for them, the clever plan for them."
*Exegetical Notes*: *Yin zhong yi ning suo wen* (因众以宁所闻) means to entrust oneself to the multitude’s knowledge and perceptions, thereby attaining tranquility.

The *bu ru zhong ji* (不如众技) reads *qǐ* in the *qǐ* rhyme. *Zhong yi* (众矣): If I rely on my own knowledge to surpass the multitude, the multitude’s skills will outnumber mine—how can I avoid self-imposed distress?

*[Annotation 5] Commentary*: Those who seek to govern others’ states yet refuse to rely on the multitude’s self-governance, imposing their own will instead, merely chase the profit of the Three Kings’ dominion while blind to the peril of their own doing. Yet how did the Three Kings secure their profit? By entrusting themselves to the self-governance of all under heaven.

*Subcommentary*: Those who govern a state through their own partiality and obstinacy merely chase the profit of the Three Kings’ dominion, unaware that it spells their own ruin.

*Exegetical Notes*: *Ci lan* (此揽) is pronounced *lǎn*; the original text also writes it as *lan* (览).

*[Annotation 6] Subcommentary*: To seek illicit gain for a royal state through coercion and presumption—such fortune for a single person—inevitably leads to ruin. Not one in ten thousand survives; how fleeting is such a fate!

*Exegetical Notes*: *Jiao* (侥) is read as *gǔ yáo* in the *Gu Yao* rhyme; Xu Shen reads it as *gǔ liǎo*, and the character may also be written as *jiao* (徼). *Xing* (幸) is pronounced *xìng*. One interpretation: *jiao xing* (侥幸) describes an insatiable pursuit of profit. ◎Qing Fan’s note: *Jiao* means coercion or seeking. The *Exegetical Notes* sometimes write it as *jiao* (徼), which also means seeking (see Gao You’s commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, "Ode to the People"). *Ji he* (几何) is read as *jū qǐ*; Guo Pu reads it as *jù jī*. *Bu sang* (不丧) is read as *xī làng*, and the same applies below and in the commentary.

*[Annotation 7] Commentary*: The self and all under heaven arise through mutual reliance. If one insists on monopolizing all under heaven with a single self, all under heaven becomes obstructed—how can the self remain unobstructed? Thus, the self fails to achieve completion, and the myriad regions suffer ruin beyond measure.

*Subcommentary*: To rule as a sovereign with a presumptuous heart is to ensure no success in preservation and excess in ruin.

*Exegetical Notes*: *Wan fen* (万分) is read as written, or alternatively as *fú wèn*.

*[Annotation 8] Subcommentary*: This line laments that rulers fail to recognize the harm of presumption.

*Collation Notes*:
(1) The Jiangnan ancient manuscript reads *ci yi* (此以) as *yi ci yin* (以此因).
(2) The Shide Hall edition omits this line.
(3) The Shide Hall edition omits the character *zhong* (众).

Those who possess land possess great dominion. Those who possess great dominion cannot be possessed by it. To be possessed yet not possessed—only thus can one master all things. Understanding that the master of all things is not a thing itself—how could this apply merely to governing the people of all under heaven? Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called "possessing singularity." Those who possess singularity are called "most noble."

*[Annotation 1] Subcommentary*: The ninth and fifth hexagrams, lofty and revered, vast as the four seas—these are called great dominion.

*[Annotation 2] Commentary*: Those who cannot use things but are used by them are merely things themselves—how can they master all things? Unable to master all things, they are unfit to possess great dominion.

*Subcommentary*: Those who pursue the dominion of the Three Kings yet fail to let things govern themselves are instead governed by things. If the self is but a thing, how can it master all things? It is utterly impossible.

*[Annotation 3] Commentary*: Those who use things are not used by them. Not being used by things, they are not things. Not being things, they can govern the things of all under heaven, allowing each to attain its proper place.

*Subcommentary*: Not being used by things but using them. ◎Jia Shifu says: When a thing exists and one perceives it as a thing to be mastered, one remains bound to it for life. The greater the thing one perceives, the smaller one’s self becomes. Yet when one perceives no thing at all, all things submit of their own accord. If one does not even perceive a thing, how can one be concerned with its size? ◎Yu Yue says: Guo Xiang’s division of the phrase *bu ke yi wu wu* (不可以物物) into five characters as a single clause misreads the text. It should be read as *bu ke yi wu* (不可以物) for the first clause and *wu er bu wu* (物而不物) for the second.

*[Annotation 4] Commentary*: Relying on the self-governance of all under heaven, one roams boundlessly among the myriad things.

*Subcommentary*: The sage, attuned to nature and penetrating the workings of creation, employs the knowledge of the people and the senses of all beings—thus understanding that the master of all things is not a thing itself. How could this apply merely to wearing the imperial yellow, sitting in the Fenyang Palace, holding the jade seal, and governing all under heaven? One must instead transcend the six directions, soar beyond the heavens, traverse the nine provinces, and wander the slopes of Mount Guye.

*[Annotation 5] Commentary*: While others distinguish themselves, one alone roams in harmony with the multitude—this is what it means to come and go alone. To possess this singularity is to truly possess singularity.

*Subcommentary*: As per the commentary.

*[Annotation 6] Commentary*: Those who merge with the multitude in profound unity do not seek nobility from others, yet others cannot but revere them—this is the highest nobility. If, however, one clings to partial views and takes singular distinction as one’s aim, even if aligned with a single purpose, one remains but a thing among the common—no true singularity. Without singularity, to covet rank and titles, seizing what is not rightfully one’s own—how could the multitude submit? Thus, one is not most noble.

*Subcommentary*: While others seek to stand out, one alone roams in harmony with the multitude—a feat no other can achieve, hence called "possessing singularity." Those who possess singularity are joyfully embraced by the people, borne aloft by the masses. To be their sovereign is to be most exalted and noble.

*Exegetical Notes*: *Tao* (饕) is read as *tǔ dāo*. *Mao* (冒) is read as *wáng bèi* or *wáng bào*.

*Collation Notes*:
(1) The Shide Hall edition adds *ye* (也) after *zhi* (之).
(2) The twenty-seven characters from *ren jie zi yi* (人皆自异) to *ke wei du you yi* (可谓独有矣) are mistakenly inserted into the commentary and should be deleted.

The great person’s teaching is like form to shadow, sound to echo. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what lies in the questioner’s heart, serving as a counterpart to all under heaven. Abiding in no-echo, moving in no-direction, they grasp and guide you through the tumult of going and returning, roaming without end. Emerging and entering without side, with the sun having no beginning, they extol and discourse on the bodily form, harmonizing with the Great Unity—unified in the Great Unity yet without self. Without self, how could there be anything possessed? Those who perceive possession are the gentlemen of former times; those who perceive nothingness are friends of heaven and earth.

*Subcommentary*:
The hearts of the common people are form and sound; the great person’s teaching is shadow and echo. What intent does the great person hold toward all under heaven? Merely following form and sound like shadow and echo.

*Exegesis*:
The great person is the sage. Without intent, they respond—not by intent—thus the hearts of the common people are form and sound, and the great person’s teaching is shadow and echo.

*Annotation*:
- *To shadow/echo* (于向): pronounced *xǔ zhàng*. The original also writes *响* (echo).
- *Exhausting what lies in the questioner’s heart*: allowing each to fully express what they hold within.
- *Serving as a counterpart*: the questioner is the host; the response thus serves as counterpart.
- *Abiding in no-echo*: dwelling in stillness to await things.
- *Moving in no-direction*: transforming in accord with things.
- *Grasp and guide you through the tumult of going and returning*: *tumult* (挠挠) means self-movement. Lifting and guiding the myriad things, they restore their self-moving nature—this is the perfection of non-action.
- *Roaming without end*: moving in unison with transformation, hence without end.
- *Emerging and entering without side*: mystically identical, without outward mark.
- *With the sun having no beginning*: moving in unison with daily renewal, hence without beginning.
- *Harmonizing with the Great Unity*: their form and appearance differ not from heaven and earth.
- *Unified in the Great Unity yet without self*: possessing a self precludes Great Unity.
- *Without self, how could there be anything possessed?*: The difficulty in all under heaven lies in the self. Once the self is absent, the multitude of things need no longer be possessed.
- *Those who perceive possession*: merely those who beautify names.
- *Those who perceive nothingness*: allowing things to live in their singularity.

*Collation Notes*:
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition writes *响* (echo); the Shide Hall edition writes *向* (toward). Following the *Exegesis*, it should be *向*.
(2) The character *也* is amended according to the Shide Hall edition.

What is base yet cannot be left unengaged is *things*;
what is lowly yet cannot be left unaccommodated is *the people*;
what is hidden yet cannot be left undone is *affairs*;
what is coarse yet cannot be left unarticulated is *law*;
what is distant yet cannot be left unoccupied is *righteousness*;
what is intimate yet cannot be left unexpanded is *benevolence*;
what is measured yet cannot be left unaccumulated is *ritual*;
what is centered yet cannot be left unexalted is *virtue*;
what is singular yet cannot be left unchanged is *the Dao*;
what is numinous yet cannot be left unenacted is *Heaven*.

Thus the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist,
accomplishes virtue yet is not encumbered,
emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme,
converges in benevolence yet does not rely,
approaches righteousness yet does not accumulate,
responds to ritual yet does not avoid,
engages with affairs yet does not decline,
orders by law yet does not disorder,
depends on the people yet does not belittle,
follows things yet does not abandon.
Things are not worth acting upon, yet they cannot be left unacted upon.

One who is not enlightened by Heaven is not pure in virtue;
one who does not penetrate the Dao has no means of proceeding;
one who is not enlightened by the Dao—how lamentable!

---
*Annotations*:
- **The people**: Accommodating their nature and engaging them leads to order; opposing their nature and oppressing them leads to chaos. That the people and things are lowly and base arises from the failure to accommodate and engage. Thus, engaging the base brings honor; accommodating the lowly brings esteem—this is the inevitable correspondence.
- *Though the people dwell below, each possesses abilities; though things are light and base, all bear useful qualities. No material is to be discarded; no person is to be left unused—thus all may flourish.*
- **Affairs**: Affairs are concealed in that place, hence "hidden." Each has its own course, hence they cannot be left undone—only appropriately engaged.
- *Affairs may be hidden or manifest, natures skilled or unskilled; some are manifest here, hidden there; skilled here, unskilled there. One must only engage them, and all affairs will be settled.*
- **Law**: Law is the trace of wondrous affairs—how can one fail to articulate wondrous affairs because their trace is coarse?
- *Law refers to teachings. Using teachings to seek principle, principle is wondrous while law is coarse—like the fish-trap and rabbit-snare, one follows and articulates the traces.*
- **Righteousness**: Only by occupying it does one perceive its distance.
- *Though righteousness is distant from the Dao, if it accords with principle, one must still make judgments.*
- **Benevolence**: Intimacy suffers from partiality; only by expanding it does one achieve benevolence.
- *Intimacy, though partial and narrow, when universally and broadly extended, becomes great benevolence.*
- **Ritual**: Ritual’s measures risk being bound to singularity; thus, when embodied in each thing, they accumulate and become all-encompassing.
- *Accumulation means thickness. Measures refer to patterns. Ritual values reciprocity, yet human sentiment is shallow and thin. Thus, one outwardly displays refined conduct while inwardly fostering deep accumulation—this is true ritual.*
- **Virtue**: What is below in affairs, though centered, is not virtue.
- *Centered means compliant. Those who cultivate the Dao harmonize their light with the world, remaining humble and compliant toward things while maintaining lofty aspirations and pure conduct—though dyed, their virtue remains unstained.*
- *Centered: compliant. Compliant with their nature yet exalted.*
- **The Dao**: What is difficult in affairs, though singular, is not the Dao—how much less when not singular!
- *The wondrous root is singular qi, which pervades and generates the myriad things. How simple and easy—surely this is the Dao!*
- *Unchanged: as in "unchanging." The annotation below is the same.*
- **Heaven**: Insisting on non-action, though numinous, is not Heaven—how much less when not numinous!
- *Heaven’s numinous workings are unfathomable, manifesting and concealing without fixed pattern, flowing with opportunity without obstruction—this is its natural accord.*
- **Observes Heaven yet does not assist**: Merely following its self-so.
- *The sage observes the wondrous principle of nature, fully complying with the myriad things without assisting their inherent dispositions. The following explains the preceding text.*
- **Accomplishes virtue yet is not encumbered**: Naturally converges with the exalted.
- *Able to merge environment and wisdom, once exalted virtue is accomplished, one is naturally free from blemishes and burdens.*
- **Emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme**: Unscheming unity is what makes it easy.
- *Manifesting the wondrous singular Dao—how could one wait for schemes before speaking!*
- **Converges in benevolence yet does not rely**: Relying precludes expansiveness.
- *The Laozi says, "Acting without relying." Benevolent and compassionate love values appropriateness, hence there is no reliance.*
- **Approaches righteousness yet does not accumulate**: Following one’s nature and dwelling in the distant is not accumulation.
- *The sage’s thatched hut is not to be treasured; once the straw dogs are displayed, why accumulate and retain them!*
- **Responds to ritual yet does not avoid**: Naturally responds to ritual, not through avoidance or taboo.
- *The wondrous root is profoundly still; its traces respond to ritual—how could one be bound by avoidance or taboo!*
- *Yu Yue says: "Avoid" should be read as "oppose." "Avoid" and "oppose" share the phonetic element *wei*, hence the *Guangya*’s *Exegesis* says: "Avoid means to shun." Wei Zhao’s annotations to the *Zhouyu* and *Jinyu* both say: "Oppose means to shun." Thus, the two words are phonetically close and semantically connected. "Responds to ritual yet does not avoid" means "does not oppose."*

Guo’s commentary states: "Naturally responds to ritual, not through avoidance or taboo"—this is overly circuitous.

**Responds to affairs with principle, taking success or failure upon oneself; moves when movement is called for, without refusal or deference.**

In blending with the俗 while riding its waves, one engages with affairs as they arise, responding to the moment without grasping, without refusal or deference.

*Yingsheng* (for *应动*): *yìshēng* (rising tone).

**Guides the coarse with the wondrous, thus avoiding disorder.**

Following the nature of things, one governs them with the Dao, thus avoiding disorder.

**Relies on their self-soing, not lightly employing them.**

The people are the root of the state; when the root is firm, the state is at peace. Thus, one relies on and does not dare to employ them lightly.

**Thereby taking them on, not abandoning their root.**

Following the hearts of the black-haired people and the natures of the myriad things, though laws and teachings are applied, they are not made to depart from their original nature.

**Now, as for doing—how could one do for the sake of feet? One embodies this doing, thus it cannot be stopped.**

The endowments of things differ in their functions. Like the dung beetle rolling its ball or the spider weaving its web, these arise from nature, not from acquired learning. Thus, what is not inherent cannot be forcibly done, while what lies within one’s nature cannot but be done.

*Mò zú wéi* (nothing to be done) lies beyond one’s nature; *ér bùkě bù wéi* (cannot but be done) lies within it.

**Not understanding the natural leads to contrivance; contrivance renders virtue impure.**

Obscuring the principle of the natural results in the impurity of shallow and insubstantial virtue.

**Unable to empty oneself and await things, one loses harmony in every affair.**

Clinging to the empty and mysterious Dao-nature, one collides with things like a wall—truly, there is no path by which this may succeed.

**Ignorant of the principle of Heaven and man, confused about the meaning of ruler and minister, their actions stumble and falter—deeply lamentable.**

What is the Dao?
There is the Dao of Heaven, and the Dao of Man.

That which is revered through non-action (*wuwei*) is the Dao of Heaven; that which is burdened through action is the Dao of Man.

The ruler embodies the Dao of Heaven; the minister embodies the Dao of Man. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man are vastly distant from one another—this must not go unexamined.

To be above and entrust all things to their own spontaneity is the Dao of Heaven. Non-interference and non-action, revered and exalted above, accord with the natural Dao of Heaven.

To be burdened by action is to fail to follow one’s inherent attainment. Those who hold office and act are entangled in worldly affairs—this is the Dao of human relations.

To be one with Heaven’s entrustment of things is to naturally preside over them. The lord, above and entrusting things, accords with the non-action of the Dao of Heaven.

Each fulfills their appointed role.

When the ruler’s position is one of non-action, delegating to the hundred officials, and the officials each attend to their duties while the ruler does not intervene, both achieve self-attainment through non-doing. Thus, the ruler’s path is one of ease, while the minister’s path is one of toil—the disparity between labor and leisure cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

The ruler’s position is exalted, entrusted to stewards; the minister’s path is humble, exhausting sincerity in service to the ruler. Thus, the ruler’s path is ease, the minister’s path is toil—they cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

If this is not examined, the positions of ruler and minister will fall into chaos.

The Dao of Heaven is for the ruler and non-action; the Dao of Man is for the minister and affairs. With distinction in rank and difference in labor and leisure, each maintaining their proper place, both ruler and minister achieve non-action. If one fails to discern this principle, labor and leisure will be misaligned, and ruler and minister will fall into disorder.

Though Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformation is uniform; though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one; though the people are many, their lord is the ruler.

The ruler originates in virtue and is perfected by Heaven. Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action—nothing but the virtue of Heaven.

Their transformation is uniform through non-action and self-transformation.

Heaven and Earth give birth and nurture, covering and sustaining without end. Among all forms and substances, they are the most vast; yet their ceaseless transformation remains unchanging, their moment-to-moment renewal truly equal—this is what is meant by "nurturing them."

The myriad things, though numerous, are governed by their inherent attainment—this is what is meant by "poisoning them."

Though the common people are many, their lord is the ruler. Without self-interest, he presides over all.

The ruler takes virtue as his origin, and all things attain their proper state. What is attained is self-attainment, and thus, though attained, it is not owed gratitude—this is how Heaven is perfected.

Observing through the Dao, the rulers of the world are rectified; observing through the Dao, the duties of ruler and minister are clarified; observing through the Dao, the officials of the world are well-governed; observing through the Dao in all directions, the responses of the myriad things are complete.

Thus, that which pervades Heaven and Earth is virtue; that which flows through the myriad things is the Dao; that which governs the people above is affairs; that which enables skillful execution is technique.

Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by duty, duty by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by Heaven.

Thus it is said: The ancients who nurtured the world had no desires, and the world was sufficient; they practiced non-action, and the myriad things were transformed; they were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.

It is recorded: "Mastering the One, all affairs are complete. Without intent, one gains, and ghosts and spirits submit."

**Annotation [1]:** "Non-action" means that the ruler acts naturally, not perversely.
**Subcommentary:** Observing the principle of emptiness and penetration, one examines the patterns of responding to things. The ruler who practices non-action and follows the natural course does not employ perverse words, thus aligning with the correct Dao.

**Jia Shifu says:** "Words" are names. Rectifying the ruler’s name, the world naturally obeys his commands. Thus it is said: Naming must be expressible, and it is simply a matter of aligning with the Dao.

**Exegetical Note:** *Fei xie ye* (非邪也) is read as *sì jiē fǎn* (似嗟反). Some versions read *zuò* (作) instead of *wéi* (為).

**Annotation [2]:** Each fulfilling its proper role, non-action belongs to the superior position, and action to the inferior.
**Subcommentary:** The ruler’s Dao is non-action, while the minister’s Dao involves affairs. The distinction between honor and baseness, labor and ease, is inherently different. For example, the head naturally resides above, and the feet below. Observing through the Dao, the divisions of duty are clear.

**Annotation [3]:** When officials each fulfill their capacities, there is good governance.
**Subcommentary:** Offices have ranks, and abilities vary in excellence. When each receives their proper office, things are impartially achieved. Thus, the officials of the world are well-governed.

**Annotation [4]:** Through non-action, the world responds with its own non-action.
**Subcommentary:** The great Dao generates things, whose natures and dispositions differ. Following their own principles, all are complete. Some run, some fly, each serving its function without deliberate intent. How could one impose a design? Thus, observing through principle, the responses of the myriad things are complete.

The Master said: "The Dao covers and sustains the myriad things—how vast and great it is! The noble person cannot but hollow out their heart. Non-action as action is called Heaven; non-action in speech is called virtue; loving people and benefiting things is called benevolence; making the unlike alike is called greatness; acting without eccentricity is called magnanimity; possessing myriad differences is called richness. Thus, holding to virtue is called discipline; virtue’s completion is called establishment; following the Dao is called fulfillment; not allowing things to thwart one’s will is called wholeness. The noble person who understands these ten is vast in the greatness of their intent, abundant in their passage through the myriad things. Such a one hides gold in the mountains, conceals pearls in the depths, does not prize goods or wealth, does not draw near to nobility or riches; does not delight in long life, does not grieve over early death; is not honored by success, is not shamed by poverty; does not claim the world’s benefits as private gain, does not regard ruling the world as personal eminence. Eminence is clarity. The myriad things are one storehouse; death and life share the same form."

**Annotation [1]:** Having intent burdens one’s naturalness, so it must be hollowed out and removed.
**Subcommentary:** The Master is Laozi. Zhuangzi studied under Lao Jun, hence he is called the Master. *Kū* (刳) means to remove or cleanse. The Dao of emptiness and penetration encompasses all without exception. The Two Modes depend on it for covering and sustaining; the myriad things obtain it for transformation and generation. What does not proceed from this? It is the root of things. Marveling at its vast greatness, he exhorts the rulers of the age: Should they not model themselves on the Dao’s non-action and wash away the burdens of having intent?

**Exegetical Note:** *Fūzǐ* (夫子): Sima [Biao] says it is Zhuangzi. Another version says it is Laozi.

These two Masters state that the Yuanjia edition treats them as separate chapters, and the Cui edition does likewise.

**Annotations:**
- *Fùzài* (覆載): *fāngfù* (芳富) rhyme.
- *Yángyáng* (洋洋): pronounced *yáng*, also *xiáng*.
- *Bù kū* (不刳): *kǒuwú* (口吴) rhyme, also *kǒuhóu* (口侯). The Cui edition writes *xuān* (轩), glossed as "a countenance of ease and joy."
- *Ér qù* (而去): *qǐlǚ* (起吕) rhyme.

**[2]**
**Annotation:** Not acting for the sake of acting, yet this acting arises of itself—this is the Dao of Heaven.
**Subcommentary:** Acting through non-action, moving in accord with one’s nature. The heavenly mechanism unfolds spontaneously, hence it is called "Heaven." This is acting without acting for the sake of acting.

**[3]**
**Annotation:** Not speaking for the sake of speaking, yet these words arise of themselves—this is true virtue.
**Subcommentary:** Silent and without discourse, yet responding without limit, like a mirror hung high in a hall: when things come, it reflects them. Speech and silence are not distinct, hence it is called "virtue." This is speaking without speaking for the sake of speaking.

**[4]**
**Annotation:** This is to follow the natural tendencies of one’s nature and destiny.
**Subcommentary:** Compassion flows like clouds, love spreads like rain. Without partiality in the heart, virtue and grace extend universally. Entrusting to one’s nature and destiny, this is called "benevolence."

**[5]**
**Annotation:** The myriad things and myriad forms each abide in their proper place. Not drawing others to be the same as oneself—this is how greatness is achieved.
**Subcommentary:** Carving and sculpting the multitude of forms, each with its distinct nature. Following their inherent allotment, all harmonize with the natural. Acting without cutting or dividing, this is called "greatness."

**[6]**
**Annotation:** Mysteriously identifying self and other, the myriad things naturally find accommodation—hence there is surplus.
**Subcommentary:** Concealing one’s brilliance and obscuring one’s traces, blending with the world and riding its waves. If one’s cultivated virtue does not differ from others, and one’s established conduct is no different from things, yet the heart has no bounds—like waves stretching a thousand *li*, forests and marshes teeming with life—this may be called "magnanimity."

**[7]**
**Annotation:** I do not differ from anything, hence I alone possess these ten thousand.
**Subcommentary:** Occupying the position of the nine-fifth, wielding the might of ten thousand chariots, accommodating the myriad things’ differences, following the multitudes’ diversities—yet all natures attain fulfillment. Thus one may abundantly possess all under Heaven.

**[8]**
**Annotation:** Virtue is the guiding principle of humanity.
**Subcommentary:** One who can uphold the virtue cultivated beforehand may be called the guiding thread of the multitude of things.

**[9]**
**Annotation:** That which is accomplished without virtue cannot be called establishment.
**Subcommentary:** Only when virtue is fully realized can one establish merit and aid the world.

**[10]**
**Annotation:** The Dao does not favor any particular thing.
**Subcommentary:** *Xún* (循) means to follow. Only by following the empty and penetrating can one’s virtue be complete.

**Exegetical Note:**
- *Xún* (循): pronounced *xún*, sometimes written *xiū* (修).

**[11]**
**Annotation:** Inner self-possession.
**Subcommentary:** *Cuò* (挫) means to bend. Indifferent to praise or blame, blending honor and disgrace, not allowing worldly things to bend one’s integrity—this is the perfection of virtue.

**Exegetical Note:**
- *Cuò* (挫): *zuòwò* (作卧) rhyme.

**[12]**
**Annotation:** A great heart, thus no affair is unaccommodated.
**Subcommentary:** *Tāo* (韬) means to encompass. If the ten matters of the noble and worthy unfold before one, one can embrace all affairs, for the heart’s nature is magnanimous.

**Exegetical Note:**
- *Tāo* (韬): *tǔdāo* (吐刀) rhyme. The *Guǎngyǎ* states: "to conceal."
◎ **Yu Yue’s Note:** Guo’s annotation fails to grasp the meaning of *shì* (事).

To set the heart is akin to establishing the heart, speaking of the greatness of its establishment. The *Zheng* commentary on the *Liji*’s "Jiao Te Sheng" chapter states: "事 (*shì*) means 立 (*lì*), to establish." The *Shiming* says: "事 (*shì*) is 倳 (*zì*); 倳 (*zì*) is 立 (*lì*), to stand." Both serve as evidence. If we follow Guo’s annotation, then the heart suffices to accommodate affairs, rather than affairs setting the heart. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s "Lun Ren" chapter reads: "事心乎自然之涂 (*shì xīn hū zìrán zhī tú*)," where *shì xīn* are conjoined in the text, its meaning identical to this passage—sufficient proof of Guo’s annotation being in error.

**[13]**
**Annotation:** Virtue and grace overflow abundantly, allowing the myriad things to go their own way.
**Subcommentary:** *Shì* (逝) means to go. With a heart of magnanimous ease and virtue overflowing like a flood, all living beings naturally turn toward it.
**Exegetical Note:**
- *Pèi* (沛): *pǔbèi* (普贝) rhyme. The *Zilin* states: "to flow."
- *Shì* (逝) in the *Cui* edition is written *qǐ* (启), meaning "to open."
- *Pāngpèi* (滂沛): *pǔpáng* (普旁) rhyme.

**[14]**
**Annotation:** Does not prize rare and precious things.
**Subcommentary:** If one proceeds as before, this is non-action. Having no longing for glory, one does not value treasures. Thus, pearls born in water are not sought and so remain hidden in the depths; gold issuing from mountains is not pursued and so stays concealed in the peaks.

**[15]**
**Annotation:** Thus one can forget the self—how much more wealth and property!
**Subcommentary:** Though one may obtain pearls and jade, one does not covet them for personal gain; how then could one use goods and riches for profit!

**[16]**
**Annotation:** They come and go as mere lodging; the heart ever distances itself from them.
**Subcommentary:** Whether coming or going as a guest, one feels neither sorrow nor joy. Thus, one remains outwardly aloof from high office and inwardly distant from wealth and honor.
**Exegetical Note:**
- *Bù jìn* (不近): the *jìn* of *fùjìn* (附近), "to be near."

**[17]**
**Annotation:** What is called "suspended release."
**Subcommentary:** Even if one’s years are long, one does not rejoice; if life is cut short, one does not grieve.
**Exegetical Note:**
- *Bù lè* (不乐): pronounced *luò*.
- *Xuánjiě* (县解): *xuán* (上音玄), *jiě* (下音蟹).

**[18]**
**Annotation:** Forgets life and death in the breast—how much more the vicissitudes of success and failure!
**Subcommentary:** Wealth, honor, and prosperity are not taken as glory; poverty, lowliness, and obstruction are not taken as shame. If even life and death are not set in the mind, how could the feelings of glory and disgrace find a place!

**[19]**
**Annotation:** All are entrusted to the myriad things.
**Subcommentary:** Illuminating the cosmos, ruling all under Heaven, the treasures of the four seas are all at one’s command—yet one does not value wealth and property, entrusting them to the myriad states. How could one restrict them for personal use!

**[20]**
**Annotation:** Suddenly, one is unaware of glory residing in the self.
**Subcommentary:** Nurturing the black-haired people, ruling all under Heaven, one ascribes merit to things and forgets one’s own wealth and honor, thus not taking one’s greatness as glory.
**Exegetical Note:**
- *Bù yǐ wáng* (不以王): *wáng* pronounced *yù*; the same for *wáng dé* (王德) below.

**[21]**
**Annotation:** If not manifest, then silence alone.
**Subcommentary:** *Míng* (明) means to reveal. Though seated at Fenyang, having lost the world, if one must display wisdom, how can this be called concealing one’s light!

**[22]**
**Annotation:** Shedding like a cicada, nowhere to be found.
**Subcommentary:** Forgetting self and others, the myriad things may be as one’s storehouse; oblivious to change, life and death share the same form. If life and death bring no change to the self, how much less the vicissitudes of success, failure, life, and death!
**Exegetical Note:**
- *Tuìrán* (蜕然): *shìruì* (始锐) rhyme, also pronounced *yuè*.
**Collation Notes:**
(1) *Quēwù* cites the *Zhang Junfang* edition, where *cáng* (藏) is written as *shěn* (沈).
(2) The *Zhao Jianyi* edition writes *yǐ* (已) as *zhǐ* (止).

The Master said: "The Dao—how abysmal its dwelling, how limpid its clarity! Metals and stones cannot attain it, and thus have no means to resound. Therefore, metals and stones possess sound, yet without being struck, they do not ring. Who among the myriad things can determine this?

The person of royal virtue moves in purity and feels shame at becoming entangled in affairs. They establish the root and origin, and their knowledge flows into the numinous. Thus their virtue is vast. When their heart issues forth, things gather to it. Therefore, form does not arise without the Dao, and life does not become luminous without virtue. To preserve form and exhaust life, to establish virtue and illuminate the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue?

How boundless! Suddenly emerging, suddenly stirring, and the myriad things follow—this is called the person of royal virtue. Gazing into the darkness, listening to the soundless: within the darkness, they alone perceive the dawn; within the soundless, they alone hear the harmony. Thus, profound beyond profundity, they are able to embody things; numinous beyond numinosity, they are able to embody essence. Therefore, in their encounter with the myriad things, they reach the utmost void and yet supply what is sought. They gallop through time, seizing the lodging of things—great and small, long and short, far and near."

---
**Annotation [1]**
**Subcommentary:** The ultimate principle is profoundly mysterious, like an abyssal sea. Limpid and pure, it illumines even the finest details. "Abysmal" expresses its dwelling in stillness and depth; "limpid" expresses its constancy in purity despite movement. Some editions write *jūn* (君, "lord") instead.

**Exegetical Note:**
- *Liáo* (漻): Li reads *liángyóu*; Xu reads *lìxiāo*; the *Guang Ya* reads *xiàqiǎo*, glossing it as "appearance of clarity."

**Annotation [2]**
**Commentary:** Sound emerges from silence.

**Subcommentary:** Resonance arises from silence, response from truth. Metals and stones inherently contain the five notes, yet without being struck, they remain silent. This is like the heart of the perfected person, which truly holds sagely virtue—if things do not stir it, no response is manifest. Earlier, the abyssal waters were invoked to clarify the ultimate Dao; here, metals and stones are used to reveal the sagely heart.

**Annotation [4]**
**Commentary:** Response and stimulus are without fixed direction.

**Subcommentary:** This is like a bright mirror or an empty valley: things arrive, and it responds, yet without intent. Since things vary endlessly in length and brevity, the response likewise has no fixed shape or measure.
◎ Jia Shifu says: Within the abysmal stillness and limpid clarity, the heavenly mechanism moves of itself. The mechanism’s movement has that which moves it, yet its movement is without constancy. Metals and stones are likewise without constancy, yet the music of *Shao*, *Xia*, *Hu*, and *Wu* arises from what moves them. That which moves them cannot be determined by things.

**Annotation [5]**
**Commentary:** They follow their purity and go forth—it is not that they delight in becoming entangled in affairs.

**Subcommentary:** *Sù* means "true"; *shì* means "to go." The person of royal virtue is neither arrogant nor self-important. They follow their true nature and proceed, embracing simplicity in lofty purity, thus feeling shame at becoming entangled in worldly affairs.

**Exegetical Note:**
- *Fēi hào* (非好): Read *hūbào*.

**Annotation [6]**
**Commentary:** The root is established, and knowledge does not run counter.

**Subcommentary:**
The "spirit" refers to its unfathomable function. It ever abides in principle, proceeding to respond to things. The unfathomable spirit, in its knowing, pervades all things—this wondrous function necessarily relies upon the root. To show that the root can give rise to function, and that function does not deviate from the root’s meaning.

**Exegetical Note:**
- *Ér zhī* (而知): Pronounced *zhì*. The annotation is the same.

**Annotation [7]**
**Commentary:** Following simplicity, one communicates with the spirit, and thereafter it becomes ever more vast.

**Subcommentary:**
To be pure and without contrivance, to follow one’s true nature and proceed—thus the spirit’s knowing pervades all things while ever establishing the root. Function does not deviate from substance; movement does not harm stillness. When virtue and conduct are thus, is this not the great central Dao?

**Annotation [8]**
**Commentary:** Things seek it, and only then does it emerge—it does not precede things in initiating.

**Subcommentary:**
To seek. The utmost sage, empty of self, responds to things and self as one. Were it not for things seeking the sage’s virtue, the sage’s mind would have no means to manifest. The emergence of the sage’s mind truly arises from things seeking it. This shows harmony without initiating, not preceding things.

**Annotation [9]**
**Subcommentary:**
"Form" refers to the seven-foot body; "life" to the hundred-year span; "virtue" to the power of clarity and wisdom; "Dao" to the realm that can be traversed. The Dao can give life to the myriad things, thus without the Dao there is no life. Virtue can illumine the root of principle, thus without virtue there is no clarity. As the *Laozi* says: "The Dao gives birth to them; virtue nurtures them."

**Annotation [10]**
**Subcommentary:**
"Preserve" means to follow; "exhaust" means to fully realize. To follow the beauty or ugliness of form and appearance, to fully realize the brevity or longevity of life, to establish great virtue in order to rectify the age, to employ the utmost Dao in order to pervade all things—one who can do this is none other than the royal virtue!

**Annotation [11]**
**Commentary:**
*Hū* and *bó* both describe the appearance of responding without intention. Movement arises without intention, thus the myriad things follow it—this is called "vast and level." Therefore, one can preserve form and exhaust life, establish virtue and illumine the Dao, thereby perfecting royal virtue.

**Subcommentary:**
"Vast and level" is the name for broad and even. *Hū* and *bó* describe the appearance of being without intention. Things move it, and it emerges in accord with the trigger, following and yielding to things—thus things follow it. Since it possesses all excellences, it is royal virtue.

**Annotation [12]**
**Subcommentary:**
The utmost Dao is profoundly mysterious; the sage’s mind is concentrated and still. It cannot be seen with the eyes, for it is without color; it cannot be heard with the ears, for it is without sound.

**Annotation [13]**
**Commentary:** If one sees and hears without entrusting them to stillness, then there is obscurity and disharmony.

**Subcommentary:**
Though it is dark and without color, it can shape and transform the myriad images. Though it is silent and without sound, it can harmonize the tones of the eight winds. This shows that function arises from substance, and its efficacy is thus.

**Annotation [14]**
**Commentary:** Only by exhausting its source can one then act upon things.

**Subcommentary:**
It is both being and non-being, both stillness and response. Having dispensed with it again and again, it is profound beyond profundity. Having thus exhausted principle and fully realized nature, one can then act upon the multitude of things.

**Annotation [15]**
**Commentary:** Only by reaching the utmost in compliance can one then fully realize its wondrousness.

**Subcommentary:**
"Spirit" is the name for the unfathomable. Response and stillness are non-dual; being and non-being are thoroughly dispensed with. Thus, it is neither fathomable nor unfathomable, nor is it neither unfathomable—this is the essence and wondrousness of spirit.

**Annotation [16]**
**Commentary:** If I am steadfast in this and wholly entrust it to that, then that which seeks will be spontaneously supplied.

**Subcommentary:**
Having dispensed with it again and again, it is called "utmost non-being." Yet in engaging with things, it is without fixed method, adapting to the trigger as fitting. The thousand differences and ten thousand kinds—whatever seeks is supplied, like a mirror hung high in the hall, reflecting whatever comes before it.

**Exegetical Note:**
- *Ér gōng* (而供): Pronounced *gōng*; the original also writes it as *gōng*.
- *Què* (确): Pronounced *kùxué*.
- *Sī* (斯): Pronounced *sì* or read as written.

**Annotation [17]**
**Commentary:** All are indulged and entrusted to it, meeting only at their utmost.

**Subcommentary:**
To gallop; to meet. If one embodies the utmost non-being, one can thus respond to what is sought in a fitting manner. Therefore, one can comply with the times and follow what is entrusted, responding to things in manifold ways, ultimately converging without being fixed to one. Thus, it may be great or small, now short, now long, even to the farthest reaches. Whatever comes is indulged, adapting to the affairs of the trigger, supplying all that is sought, administering medicine according to the illness—there is nothing that is not fitting.

The Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Waters, ascended the Kunlun peaks and gazed southward. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found. He sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found. He sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Then he sent Imageless, and Imageless found it. The Yellow Emperor said: "How strange! Could it be that only Imageless could obtain it?"

**Annotation [1]**
**Commentary:** This illustrates the means by which the true is obtained.

**Exegesis:** Red is the color of the southern direction, and the heart is the organ of the southern direction. Water’s nature is flowing and mobile, its position in the north. This is like a deluded mind mistaking a mirror—dark and without illumination—hence it speaks of “north of the Red Waters.” Kunlun peaks are the body. South is the direction of clarity and brightness; *wang* (望) means “to observe and perceive.” *Xuan* (玄) denotes what is distant and subtle; the pearl is a treasure of precious value. This illustrates that all beings in the world, without exception, are deluded in body and mind, galloping in attachment, without awareness or understanding—dark as the northern direction, moving like flowing water, losing the true and forfeiting the Dao, all arising from this cause. Now, if one wishes to return to the root and revert to the source, to seek the true and inquire after the Dao, one must gaze southward to demonstrate illumination and insight, and “return” to signify the restoration of the mandate. Thus, it first clarifies where the true is lost, then reveals the method of attaining the Dao. The method revealed is set forth in the text below.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Red Waters*: Li [Yun] says: “The waters issue from beneath Mount Kunlun.”
*Return*: Pronounced *xuan*.
*Dark Pearl*: Sima [Biao] says: “The true of the Dao.”
◎ Qingfan’s note: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Liu Xiaobiao’s *Guang Juejiao Lun* cites Sima [Biao] as saying: “The Red Waters are a figurative name; the dark pearl is a metaphor for the Dao.” This differs from the *Explanatory Notes*.

**Commentary [2]:** This says that the use of knowledge is insufficient to attain the true.

**Commentary [3]:** "Seek" means to inquire. Thus, one cannot attain it by severing thoughts and seeking with the heart.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Shi zhi* (使知): Pronounced *zhi* (智). The pronunciation applies to the annotation and all instances below.
*Suo zhi* (索之): Pronounced *suo* (所), with the falling tone (白反). The same applies below.

**Commentary [4]:** It is not form, so one cannot grasp it with the eyes.

**Annotation [4]:** Cleverness and sharpness lead to contention, losing the true ever further.

**Commentary [4]:** "Contention" means disputation. One cannot seek it through verbal debate.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Chi* (吃): Pronounced *kouxie* (口懈反).
*Gou* (诟): Pronounced *koudou* (口豆反).
Sima [Biao] says: "Contention means exerting force."
◎ Jia Shifu notes: The *Guangyun* states: *Chi* (吃) is the same as *qi* (□). *Qi* means "sound"; *gou* (诟) means "anger," which is also a kind of sound. The *Jiyun* says this refers to forceful disputation. The wise seek it with spirit, Li Zhu seeks it in form and shadow, and the contentious seek it in sound and reputation—thus, the more they seek, the further they stray. "Vague semblance" (*xiangwang*) is as if present, as if absent, so it is said: "One obtains it with the pupil." Seeking it in form fails; seeking it beyond form also fails. The *Explanatory Notes* cite Sima [Biao]’s annotation—"contention means exerting force"—as erroneous.

**Commentary [5]:** "Vague semblance" means "without heart-mind." By departing from sound and form, severing thoughts and deliberations, knowledge and Li Zhu turn back at their limits, while contention in disputation, exerting force, loses the true. Only "vague semblance," free of heart-mind, uniquely attains the Dark Pearl.

**Annotation [6]:** To attain the true, one does not employ the heart-mind; "vague semblance" is itself the true.

**Commentary [6]:** Li Lou loses his nature by relying on keen sight and forfeiting the Dao, while the Yellow Emperor awakens to the principle, sighing that "vague semblance" obtains the pearl. He exhorts all students: thus, one need not depart from form or abandon wisdom, but may dismiss cleverness and break the body.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition writes *huan* (还) as *xuan* (旋).
(2) The character *shui* (水) follows the Hu Ke edition of the *Wen Xuan* annotation.

Yao’s teacher was Xu You, Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que, Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni, and Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.

**Annotation [1]:** The four men above were all recluses of Yao’s time, who loathed the filth of the world and embraced the Dao while holding fast to virtue. Pure and incorrupt, they kept apart from human society. Yao, knowing their worth, wished to yield the throne to them. Zhuangzi shows the transmission of lineage, thus listing their succession of master and disciple.

**Exegetical Notes:**
*Wang Ni*: Xu reads *wu xi* (五兮).
*Pi Yi*: Pronounced *pi*.

Yao asked Xu You, “Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to summon him.”

**Annotation [1]:** That is, to serve as the Son of Heaven.
**Annotation [2]:** To use his teacher as a means to summon and employ him.

**Commentary:** *Pei* means “to join.” *Jie* means “to rely upon.” Yao said, “Nie Que is a worthy man, possessing the virtue to join with Heaven’s position. Perhaps by relying on Wang Ni, I might from afar bend him to my will.” Yet uncertain of the matter, he asked Xu You.

**Exegetical Notes:**
*Yao zhi* (要之): Read *yao* (一遥反). The annotation is the same.

Xu You said, “How perilous it is—this bringing the world to the brink! Nie Que’s nature is such that his intelligence and wisdom are keen, his wit and agility swift; his nature surpasses others. Yet he would take what belongs to man and claim it as Heaven’s. He is precise in forbidding transgressions yet does not know whence transgressions arise. Could one such as he match Heaven?

He would ride upon men yet cast off Heaven, root himself in the body yet estrange its form, exalt knowledge yet blaze like wildfire, be driven by threads of affairs, be ensnared by things, turn his gaze in all directions and have things respond, adapt to every circumstance, transform with things yet never attain constancy. How could such a one suffice to match Heaven?

Nevertheless, he has kin, he has ancestors; he may serve as father to the multitude, yet cannot serve as the father of fathers. Governance is the harbinger of chaos, the calamity of facing north, the bane of facing south.”

**Annotation [1]:** *Ji* means “peril.”
**Commentary:** *Dai* means “imminent.” *Ji* means “peril.” To employ Nie Que and relinquish the throne of ten thousand chariots—signs of peril and ruin would not be far off.
**Exegetical Notes:**
*Ji*: Also written as *ji* (岌), pronounced *wu ji* (五急反) or *wu he* (五合反). Guo and Li say: “peril.”

**Annotation [2]:** One so surpassingly keen and swift would lead others to strain after him, repeatedly harming the people.
**Commentary:** *Rui* means “sagely.” *Gei* means “nimble.” *Min* means “swift.” The sage who governs the world lets his crown tassels hang before his eyes and fills his ears with silk floss, thereby blocking keen perception, desiring neither to hear nor see too much. Yet Nie Que inwardly harbors sagely wisdom, outwardly dazzles with keen intelligence, wields a swift and sharp tongue, and devises far-reaching plans. His virtue, conduct, nature, and understanding surpass others; once his traces become manifest, they will surely become a source of harm. The signs of peril and ruin are enumerated below.

**Annotation [Yishu]:** *Gei shu* reads as *shuo*.

**[3] [Annotation]:** Employing knowledge to seek the restoration of one’s natural state.

**[Commentary]:** Things have lost their true nature for a long time; now, by means of the arts of the heart and intellect, one compels them to return to their origin—thus, the natural essence is lost all the more.

**[4] [Annotation]:** Excess arises from keen intelligence, yet if one further employs knowledge to restrain it, the excess only grows worse. Thus it is said: there is no excess in eliminating knowledge, not in forcibly restraining it.

**[Commentary]:** The source from which excess arises is knowledge. Nie Que merely knows how to scrutinize and restrain the excesses of the common people, yet does not understand that the source of calamity lies in wisdom itself.

**Annotation [Yishu]:** *Zai qu* reads as *qǐ lǚ* in reverse. *Yu qiang* reads as *qí zhàng* in reverse.

**[5] [Annotation]:** If one were to grant him the world, he would thereby cause later generations to rely on knowledge and lose their true nature.

**[Commentary]:** If he were given the throne and allowed to govern the multitudes, he would surely deploy his heart and intellect, assaulting Heaven’s principles—thus, all things would lose themselves and never recover their natural essence.

**[6] [Annotation]:** To take the myriad things as one’s foundation is to unify the diverse transformations and harmonize the varied forms. Yet this course will lead later generations to take themselves as the measure for controlling things, causing the myriad things to fall into disorder.

**[Commentary]:** *Fang* means “about to.” The sage has no mind of his own and follows things as they are. Now Nie Que takes himself as the foundation, drawing things to himself and compelling the world’s diverse forms to submit to his transformation. The loss of things’ natures stems precisely from this; the calamities of later ages begin here.

**Annotation [Yishu]:** *Fang qie* is read as written. Whenever the phrase *fang qie* appears, it means “about to act.”

**[7] [Annotation]:** When the worthy occupy positions of precedence, knowledge and perception are revered in their wake, and the world races and dashes about like wildfire.

**[Commentary]:** Unable to forget knowledge and entrust things to their own course, yet exalting knowledge to govern the age, one will inevitably follow after traces, abandoning oneself to imitate others, galloping and chasing with the speed of fire.

**[8] [Annotation]:** This will initiate the beginnings of later generations’ toil and servitude.

**[Commentary]:** *Xu* means “beginning.” *Shi* means “servitude.” Unable to practice non-action, yet relying on knowledge to govern things, the labor and servitude of later ages begin here.

**[9] [Annotation]:** This will lead later generations to constrain and control things.

**[Commentary]:** *Gai* means “obstruction.” Unable to employ the Dao to connect with people, one instead relies on knowledge to obstruct things.

**Annotation [Yishu]:** *Wu gai*: Xu reads *hù gé* in reverse; *Guangya* reads *gōng cái* in reverse, glossing it as “to bind.” This aligns with Guo’s interpretation. Here, the *Guangya* pronunciation is adopted.
◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Yishu* cites *Guangya*, which glosses *gai* as “to bind.” I suspect *gai* should be *gāi*. The *Guangyun* defines *gāi* as “to encompass” or “to embrace.” The *Hanshu: Lüli zhi* states, “*Gāi* contains the myriad things”; the *Taixuanjing* says, “The myriad things are *gāi*-embraced.” *Xu shi* means its remnants suffice to *shi* (employ) the multitudes. *Wu gai* means its mechanisms suffice to encompass the myriad things.

**[10] [Annotation]:** This will lead later generations to point and command, moving things to respond to the ruler’s affairs.

**[Commentary]:** About to survey the four directions and pacify the myriad states, compelling the common people to respond to his transformative laws.

**Annotation [Yishu]:** *Ling ying* reads as *lì chéng* in reverse.

**[11] [Annotation]:** This will lead later generations to be unable to forget goodness, instead using benevolence to respond to what is fitting.

**[Commentary]:** Employing one’s own knowledge to respond to the fittingness of the myriad things, one is not without a mind—and thus not without peril.

**[12] [Annotation]:** This will lead later generations to chase after things and be unable to attain self-realization within.

**[Commentary]:** Imposing one’s own knowledge upon the multitudes, compelling the myriad things to follow transformation—once things lose themselves, the self also fails to attain realization.

**[13] [Annotation]:** All these are expedients suited to the times, yet today one receives their virtue, while tomorrow one bears their harm. Thus it is said: “There has never yet been constancy.”

**[Commentary]:** Governing things with knowledge results in policies issuing from many sources: one reaps their virtue in the present but suffers their harm later. Having departed from the purity of antiquity, there is no constancy.

**[14] [Annotation]:** Their affairs and methods can be traced and emulated.

**[Commentary]:** *Zu* means “gathering place.” Nie Que dwells in seclusion among mountains and marshes, elevating his aspirations, yet cannot blend with the world and is unfit to match Heaven. Among the mingled masses, his kind is rare—thus, his lofty and pure aspirations are indeed worthy of emulation.
◎ Jia Shifu says: *Zu* refers to the traces of comparison. *Zu* (ancestor) refers to the origin of living things. Following the traces of comparison to unite them, the myriad things are governed as one, and the ruler of things becomes the refuge of the multitudes. Tracing the origin of living things, the myriad things arise from nothingness, and the generator of things is the branching outflow. Without plumbing the origin of living things, yet busily comparing to seek unity, order and chaos arise from this, and the calamities of ruler and minister begin here.

**[15] [Annotation]:** “Father of the many fathers” is but a trace.

**[Commentary]:** *Fu* means “ruler.” Nie Que’s lofty non-action does not level him with the common world. Though his Dao may be transmitted, he is fit only to be the father of the many, not the father of fathers. The “father of fathers” is Yao. Yao sits enthroned above the myriad things, yet his heart roams to Mount Guye, where he visits the Four Masters in the land of Fenyang. Thus, from quiescence he moves, from movement he returns to quiescence; non-action becomes action, action becomes non-action—being and non-being occur simultaneously, movement and quiescence are one. Therefore, he may be the ruler among rulers, the father among fathers.

To exhaust the principles and fulfill one’s nature, delving into the ever more profound—this is how one becomes the father of the many fathers, and thus it is fitting.

Thus, Guo’s commentary states: “The father of the many fathers is but a trace.”

**[16] [Annotation]:** This speaks not only of governing lords but also of leading chaos.

**[Commentary]:** *Shuai* means “lord.” If one employs wisdom to govern things, though order may prevail at the time, disorder will surely follow. Both paths take wisdom as their lord.

**[16] [Textual Notes]:** *Zhi-luan* (治乱): *zhi* as in “govern,” *luan* as in “chaos.” *Zhi shuai* (之率): *shuai* as in *se-lei* (色类); also read *se-lü* (色律).

**[17] [Annotation]:** Jie and Zhou did not kill worthy ministers by their own power but relied on the traces of sagely wisdom to bring them to ruin.

**[Commentary]:** Jie and Zhou relied on sagely wisdom to kill worthy ministers, thus sagely wisdom is the calamity of those who face north.

**[18] [Annotation]:** Tian Huan did not kill his lord by his own power but drew upon benevolence and righteousness to harm him.

**[Commentary]:** Tian Huan drew upon benevolence and righteousness to kill his lord, thus benevolence and righteousness are the thieves of those who face south. The annotation states: “Tian Huan did not kill his lord by his own power but drew upon benevolence and righteousness to harm him.”

**[Textual Notes]:** *Sha jun* (杀君): read *shi* (试); alternate character *shi* (弒), same pronunciation.

**[Collation]:** The preceding character follows the Song edition.

Yao gazed upon Hua. The border guard of Hua said: “Ah! A sage! I beg to offer a blessing to the sage.”

**[1] [Commentary]:** *Hua* is a place name, today’s Huazhou. A *feng ren* is one who guards the borders of Hua. *Xi* is an exclamation. Seeing Yao’s sagely virtue illuminating the world, the border guard asked to bless him with longevity, wealth, and many sons.

**[Textual Notes]:** *Hua* (华): read *hu-hua* (胡化) or *hu-hua* (胡花). Sima: “A place name.” *Feng ren* (封人): Sima: “One who guards the borders.” *Yue xi* (曰嘻): read *xi* (熙). *Qing zhu* (请祝): read *zhi-you* (之又) or *zhou-liu* (州六).

“May the sage live long.” Yao said: “I decline.”
“May the sage be wealthy.” Yao said: “I decline.”
“May the sage have many sons.” Yao said: “I decline.”

**[1] [Commentary]:** Wealth, longevity, and many sons are indeed burdensome, yet one who embodies the Way does not reject non-action. Thus, through these two figures, the three afflictions are made clear. The meaning of his refusal is explained below.

The border guard said: “Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all people desire. Why do you alone not desire them?”

**[1] [Commentary]:** The three things mentioned earlier are the greatest desires of people. Why do you alone refuse them?

**[Textual Notes]:** *Nü du* (女独): read *ru* (汝); same below.

Yao said: “Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; long life brings many humiliations. These three are not what nurture virtue, and so I decline.”

**[1] [Commentary]:** When descendants flourish, anxieties multiply; when wealth abounds, affairs grow burdensome; when lifespan extends, disgrace accumulates. These three do not nourish the virtue of non-action but only add to the encumbrances of striving—hence his refusal of all.

The border guard said: “At first, I took you for a sage—now I see you are but a gentleman. Heaven generates the myriad people and must assign them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear remains? If you are wealthy and distribute it among others, what affairs remain? The sage dwells like the quail, eats like the fledgling, moves like the bird without leaving a trace. When the world follows the Way, all things flourish with him; when the world loses the Way, he cultivates virtue in seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs to become an immortal above, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. With the three afflictions kept at bay and his person ever free from harm—what humiliation remains?”

**Commentary:**
At first, I declared you possessed unparalleled illumination and thus embodied the sagely one who has realized the Dao—yet now, having abandoned all attachment to existence and non-existence, you are but a worthy gentleman.

**Annotation:** All things attain their proper place, and the will is settled.

**Commentary:** Heaven and Earth, in their transformative workings, endow the myriad beings with distinct capacities; measuring their talents to assign offices—what cause for fear remains?

**Annotation:** Entrusting it to the world, thus no affairs remain.

**Commentary:** When the hundred clans abound in prosperity and the four seas teem with abundance, entrusting it to the multitude of beings without claiming it as private—such is the absence of affairs through non-action.

**Annotation:** Without intention, yet naturally attaining tranquility.

**Exegetical Note:** *Chun* (鹑) is pronounced as *chún*. *Ju* (居): "quail-dwelling," denoting no fixed abode. Alternately: dwelling like the quail, akin to living in the wild.

**Annotation:** Depending on things to be sufficient.

**Commentary:** The quail, a wild bird, dwells without fixed abode. The fledgling, a young bird, must depend on its mother to be fed. The sage’s resting and dwelling are frugal, like the quail; his provisions are barely adequate, like the fledgling. Having no inclination toward extravagance, how could he harbor desire for rich flavors?

**Exegetical Note:** *Kòu* (鷇) is pronounced as *kòu*. The *Erya* states: "A hatchling that is fed is called *kòu*." *Kòu shí* (鷇食) means depending on things to be sufficient. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The character *shēng* (生) was formerly miswritten as *zhǔ* (主); now corrected.

**Annotation:** Following one’s nature in movement, leaving no extraordinary traces.

**Commentary:** *Zhāng* (彰) means patterned traces. The sage, having extinguished the heart-mind and obliterated knowledge, merges with things in obscurity—like a bird in flight, leaving no visible tracks.

**Annotation:** Recklessly and wantonly acting, yet naturally treading the great path.

**Commentary:** When the age is governed by clarity and peace, he governs the multitudes; when things come to move him, he responds with timely flourishing. Guo’s annotation of "recklessly and wantonly acting" seems contrary to the text’s intent.

**Annotation:** Even the deeds of Tang and Wu, if they accord with Heaven and respond to the people, are not without leisure. Thus, "non-action yet nothing left undone" is not the absence of leisure.

**Commentary:** When the times are turbulent, he conceals his brilliance and blends with the vulgar, cultivating virtue and withdrawing his traces to preserve the Dao of life, delighting in reclusion and dwelling in leisure, carefree and withdrawn from the world. This is what is meant by "concealment and emergence at will, use and disuse following the times."

**Exegetical Note:** *Jiù xián* (就闲) is pronounced as *jiù xián*. The annotation is the same.

**Annotation:** The perfected person attains the utmost longevity, mastering the transformations of thoroughgoing penetration. In life, they follow Heaven’s course; in death, they merge with the transformations of things. Thus it is said: "Weary of the world, they ascend as immortals."

**Commentary:** The sage comprehends the non-duality of life and death, the unity of change and transformation. Therefore, they fulfill the span of their allotted years, whether long or short, and weary of the clamor of the vulgar, dissolve and ascend. Why must there be the ascent of the Yellow Emperor at Mount Dinghu alone to be called an immortal? Why must the longevity of Anqi alone be deemed a thousand years?

**Phonetic Note:** *Shàng xiān* (上仙) is pronounced *xiān*.

**Annotation:** When qi disperses, there is nowhere it does not go.

**Commentary:** The essence-spirit ascends, merging obscurely with the Great Unity. Riding the clouds and commanding qi, it arrives at the realm of Heaven and Earth.

**Commentary:** The "three afflictions" refer to wealth, longevity, and many sons. One who harnesses the Creator and comes and goes, who rides transformation and roams freely—these three afflictions are fundamentally empty and null, and this seven-foot frame arises from non-being. What weight do calamity and disgrace carry?

**Textual Note:** The character *qióng* (穷) is emended to *tōng* (通) following Wang Shumin’s suggestion.

The border guard departed. Yao followed him and said, "May I ask—"

**Commentary:** After the border guard had finished speaking, he departed. Yao, having awakened to his error, thus sought to question him.

The border guard said, "Withdraw now!"

**Commentary:** Once his doubts were resolved, Yao should swiftly withdraw.

**Textual Note:** The lacuna is here supplied as *jǐ* (己) following the Jiangnan ancient manuscript.

When Yao ruled the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was enfeoffed as a lord. When Yao abdicated to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship and took up plowing.

Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the fields. Yu hastened to the lower position, stood, and asked, "In the past, when Yao ruled the world, you, sir, were enfeoffed as a lord. When Yao abdicated to Shun, and Shun to me, you, sir, resigned your lordship and took up plowing. May I ask the reason?"

**Commentary:** Bo Cheng Zi Gao—it is not known from whence he came; he was likely a man of the Dao.

**Phonetic Note:** *Bó Chéng Zǐ Gāo* (伯成子高): The *Tongbian Jing* states, "Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, my body has undergone one thousand two hundred transformations. In later ages, those who attained the Dao included Bo Cheng Zi Gao."

**Commentary:** In the age of Yao and Shun, he faced south and was called "the solitary one." Yet in the Xia dynasty, he retired to plow in the wilds. His appearances and withdrawals were suddenly different—what meaning did this hold?

Bo Cheng Zi Gao said, "In the past, when Yao ruled the world, he did not reward, yet the people were encouraged; he did not punish, yet the people stood in awe. Now you reward and punish, yet the people grow ever less humane. Virtue has declined from this point, punishments have been established from this point, and the disorders of later ages will begin from this point. Why do you tarry? Do not interfere with my work!"

He plowed with single-minded devotion, paying no heed.

**Commentary [1]:** Rewards and punishments exist to make encouragement and awe manifest. Yet Yao governed through non-action, and all things followed his transformation. Thus, the people did not wait for his commendations to exert themselves in goodness, nor did they require punishments to fear evil and refrain from it. This reveals Yao’s sagely illumination—such was his virtue.

**Commentary [2]:** Though rewards and punishments were vigorously enforced, the people still lacked benevolence. Once the highest virtue had declined, penal codes proliferated. Thus, we know the disorders of later ages began from this point.

**Annotation [3]:** During the time of Yu, three sages succeeded one another, their governance perfected and virtue complete. Yet as their achievements and excellence gradually faded, historical records had little to record, and even Confucius could not find leisure to discuss them. Thus, though they possessed the world, they did not engage with it—this was having yet not having. Examining their eras, Yu was the most outstanding; assessing their persons, though three sages, they were but one Yao. As no sage appeared in that time, the world’s heart suddenly turned to Qi. The most impartial and fitting ruler entrusted the world to the people, for taking and giving were not his own. Thus, he neither sought what was lost nor declined what was gained, departing in an instant and arriving without premeditation. For this, though he was slandered by men of integrity and his name ranked among the Three Kings, it is hardly surprising.

Zhuangzi used this to expose Yao’s flaws—flaws that began with Yao and reached their fullness with Yu. How much worse for later ages without sages! By entrusting distant traces to Bo Cheng, he abandoned governance entirely, seeking to abolish sageliness and return to unity, to discard knowledge and attain perfect tranquility. Yet in truth, this was never heard of.

Zhuangzi’s words cannot be questioned from a single path. Sometimes he shaves the traces of the Yellow Emperor and cuts the shins of Yao and Shun—how could he merely exalt Yao and disparage Yu? Thus, we must set aside his allusions and record only his intent to abolish sageliness and discard knowledge.

**Commentary:** *Hé* means "why not"; *luò* means "abandon." *Yìyì* describes the appearance of plowing. Bo Cheng addressed Yu as "Master." "Master, why do you not depart? Do not disrupt my farming!" Thereupon, he applied himself to plowing without a backward glance.

The three sages succeeded one another, and none was superior or inferior. Yet as the world shifted from simplicity to decadence, their traces differed. Guo’s annotation, "flaws began with Yao and reached their fullness with Yu," aims to show that having sages is not as good as having none, and action is inferior to non-action. Thus, he extols distant traces to illustrate the abolition of sageliness and the discarding of knowledge.

**Exegetical Notes:**
*Hé* is also written as *hé*, pronounced *húlà*. *Wú luò*: *luò* means "abandon." *Yìyì*: Xu pronounces it *yúzhí*, Li as "the appearance of plowing," another as "the bearing of a plowman," also *zhì* or *yúshí*. The *Zilin* defines it as "vigorous and robust." *Zhì chéng*: pronounced *zhílì*. *Néng xián*: *xián* as in "privy." *Bù yǔ*: pronounced *yù*. *Tóng*: pronounced *dòng*, also *tóng*.

**Variant [1]:** The Zhao Jianyi edition reads *biàn* as *shǐ*.

In the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing, without even the name of nonbeing. Where the One arose, there was the One yet no form. When things obtained this to live, it was called virtue. Before form, there were distinctions, yet they were continuous and without gaps—this was called fate. Movement was retained to generate things; when things took form and their principles of life were established, this was called shape. When shapes preserved spirit, each having its own pattern, this was called nature. Cultivating nature to return to virtue, when virtue reached its fullness, it merged with the beginning. This merging was emptiness, and emptiness was vastness. Mouths joined in harmony; when harmony was achieved, it merged with Heaven and Earth. This merging was profound and subtle, appearing foolish and benighted—this was called mysterious virtue, unity with the Great Compliance.

**Annotation [1]:** There was nonbeing, so nothing could be named.

**Commentary:** *Tài* means "great"; *chū* means "beginning." When primal *qi* first sprouted, it was called the Great Beginning, for its *qi* was vast and great, capable of being the origin of all things. Thus, it was named the Great Beginning. At the time of the Great Beginning, there was only this nonbeing, not yet being. Since being had not yet arisen, where could names reside? Hence, there was nonbeing without a name.

**Exegetical Notes:** The *Yi* says: "It is the beginning of *qi*."

**Annotation [2]:** The One is the beginning of being, the most wondrous. Being most wondrous, it had not yet the form of things and their principles. Where the One arises, it arises from the utmost One, not from nothingness. Yet why does Zhuangzi repeatedly speak of nothingness at the beginning? At the beginning, what had not been born obtained birth. Obtaining birth is difficult, yet it still did not rely on nothingness above nor await knowledge below. Suddenly, it spontaneously attained this life—why then seek life in what is already born, losing its self-generated nature?

**Commentary:** The One is the Dao, having the name of the One but not the appearance of the myriad things.

**Annotation [3]:** Nonbeing cannot generate things. Saying "things obtained this to live" clarifies that things generate themselves. Allowing them to generate themselves—this can be called virtue.

**Commentary:** Virtue means "obtaining," referring to obtaining this. When things obtained this to live, they did not rely on things externally nor derive from the self internally. Neither nonbeing nor being, neither self nor other, not knowing how they lived—this was called virtue.

**Commentary [4]:** Though they had not yet physical form, they received *qi* and had inherent distinctions. Yet these distinctions of length and brevity were continuous, without gaps—this was called fate.

**Exegetical Notes:** *Yǒu fèn*: pronounced *fúwèn*. *Wú xián*: read as written.

◎ My late uncle remarked: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao. That which continues it is goodness; that which completes it is nature." When things obtain their life, this is what is meant by "that which continues it is goodness"—yet the name "virtue" does not yet apply. Only when it congeals into fate, with nature contained therein, is this what is meant by "that which completes it is nature." Once fate is established, each takes form in its likeness; by embodying form, one returns to nature, each possessing its own norm—this is the work of fulfilling nature. Zhuangzi, in this regard, also grasped its elusive essence.

**Commentary [5]:** *Liú* means "stillness." Yang moves, yin is still; in their intermingling ascent and descent, they distribute across the Three Powers, transforming and generating the myriad things. When things attain completion, with the principles of life fully present, this is called "form."

**Exegetical Notes:** *Liú dòng*: *Liú* may also be written as *liú*.

**Commentary [6]:** Virtue, form, nature, and fate—these names arise from transformation, yet in their self-so essence, they are one.

**Commentary [7]:** *Tǐ* means "substance"; *bǎo* means "to preserve." Having received bodily substance and preserved spirit, form may be coarse or refined, while spirit may be foolish or wise. Yet each should follow its proper norm, all differing from one another. The original allotment is fixed, never to be altered—this is called "nature."

**Annotation [7]:** Always self-attained without contrivance.

**Commentary [8]:** Following this endowed nature, one cultivates and restores the original virtue of life’s beginning. Thus, when one reaches the state of virtue, one is identical with the Great Beginning.

**Annotation [8]:** Though not identical with the beginning, if one acts with purpose midway, then what one harbors is indeed a "thing." With a "thing" present, the power of nurturing virtue diminishes.

**Commentary [9]:** Identical with the Great Beginning, the mind becomes empty and vast. With the mind thus emptied, it can embrace all expansiveness.

**Annotation [9]:** Speaking without intention yet naturally uttering words—this accords with the cries of birds.

**Commentary [10]:** *Huì* means "a bird’s beak." With the mind emptied and traces obscured, one’s words merge with the cries of birds. Since bird cries are without intention toward right or wrong, how could the sage’s words bear attachment to love or hate?

**Exegetical Notes:** *Huì*: pronounced *dīngdòu*, or alternatively *chōngruì*, *xǐ*, or *huì*.

**Annotation [10]:** Heaven and Earth, too, move without intention.

**Commentary [11]:** Just as words accord with bird cries, virtue accords with Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth have no intention in their covering and supporting, just as the sage has no intention in speech—thus they merge with Heaven and Earth.

**Annotation [11]:** This merging arises from "sitting in forgetfulness," not from deliberate observation to achieve it.

**Commentary [12]:** *Mín* means "to merge." The sage inwardly aligns with the utmost principle and outwardly accords with all beings. Whether in traces or essence, nothing is left unmerged—hence the term *mínmín*. Such a one blends with the world, riding its waves, harmonizing with the dust of the myriad things, appearing foolish and confused, like one lost in darkness. Alternate interpretation: merging with bird cries and with Heaven and Earth—this, too, is *mínmín*.

**Exegetical Notes:** *Mínmín*: pronounced *wǔjīn*.

**Annotation [12]:** Virtue is profound, and that which it accords with is vast.

**Commentary [13]:** Summarizing the foregoing, one extols its excellence. Such a person may be called one of profound virtue, identical with the Great Beginning and in great accord with the world.

Confucius asked Lao Dan: "There is one who practices the Dao as if following a model—what is permissible is permissible, what is not is not; what is so is so, what is not so is not. A debater has said, *'Separating hardness and whiteness is like suspending the universe.'* Can such a one be called a sage?"

Lao Dan replied: "This is but a petty clerk’s skill—one who binds and wearies the form, startling the heart. A dog trained to hold fast grows anxious; the nimbleness of gibbons and apes comes from the mountain forests. Qiu, I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot utter. All those with heads and feet yet lacking hearts and ears are many; those with form and those without form or shape, all existing, are utterly nonexistent. Their movement is their stillness; their death is their life; their decay is their rise. Yet this is still not their *thereby*. There is governance in man—one who forgets things, forgets Heaven, is called one who forgets the self. The one who forgets the self is said to enter into Heaven."

The words of "this" and "that" vie to supplant one another, employing these arts to bind the body, thus wearying the form and startling the heart with apprehension. This answers the earlier question. *Ji* (技, "skill")—some texts write it as *zhi* (枝, "branch")—speak of "this" and "that" shifting and seizing, branching and diverging like leaves.

The above all lose their constant nature. "Chengsi" (成思) should be a corruption of "laitian" (来田); "zishanlinlai" (自山林来) ought to be a corruption of "laiji" (来藉). Gibbons and apes, swift monkeys, are hounds trained to seize foxes—often collared and leashed for the hunt, thus bound and not at ease, they grow anxious. Gibbons and apes dwell in mountain forests, roaming freely and unrestrained, their nimbleness in leaping and grasping their natural state; yet when captured and brought forth, they lose their true nature. *Li* (狸)—some texts write it as □—is the bamboo rat.

All those with beginnings and ends yet lacking hearts and ears are many—this speaks of their self-transformation. "Ru" (若) and "er" (而) both mean "you." "Beginnings and ends" refer to the cycle of existence. Reason transcends words and debate, hence they cannot hear speech. Nor can they be known by the heart’s deliberation or the ear’s hearing, so they are said to lack hearts and ears. All sentient beings without true nature are called "beginnings and ends," hence they are many. How can you, with your many displays of the gibbon’s skill or lofty, far-fetched arguments, compel others to imitate you? Is this not a mistake?

Those with form are ever-changing and cannot coexist with the formless and shapeless. Thus, one who governs the Dao does not cling to the old but follows the daily renewal of transformation. "Those with form" are the body; "the formless" is the heart. You say both heart and body exist, but through the lens of principle, I see them as entirely empty.

This speaks of movement and stillness, death and life, flourishing and decay, rise and fall—none of these are constant. All arise naturally, not by any deliberate use, so when released, they find their own harmony. Times have movement and stillness; beings have death and life; affairs have rise and fall—these six are the principles of nature, yet we know not how they come to be. How could they be tied to human thought or imitation? Simply follow and yield to the self-so of things.

Governance lies in man—not in the ruler’s self-will. Each person moves by their inherent nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolding of itself, not by the ruler’s decree.

Heaven and things are all forgotten—what more is there to possess? Not only are worldly affairs empty, but even the principles of Heaven are non-existent. Only when both affairs and principles are forgotten can one reach the ultimate of neither existence nor non-existence.

What man cannot forget is the self; yet if even the self is forgotten, what else remains to be known? This is to be unknowing and unperceiving, merging with the natural.

To enter is to unite. Of all things in the world, the hardest to forget is the self; yet if even the self can be forgotten, what in the world is worth preserving? Thus, one who forgets both self and things merges with the Dao of nature.

All beings share heads and feet; those without hearts cannot deliberate, like birds and beasts; those without ears cannot hear, like insects and fish. Their movement and stillness, their death and life, their decay and rise—all are the transformative mechanisms of Heaven and Earth. The transformative mechanism in Heaven and Earth is not exhausted by things; the formless and shapeless, shifting and surging within Heaven and Earth, are all part of this mechanism. Yet there is governance in man—how meddlesome man is! To force things to conform to governance is not as good as forgetting the self and letting things follow their own course. Only one who forgets the self can unite with Heaven in virtue.

In the *Yin* commentary to the *Bai Xin* chapter of the *Guanzi*: Heaven and Earth are those who forget form. Those who can emulate Heaven and Earth—are they not precisely those who forget the self? This aligns with the same principle.

**Textual Notes:**
(1) The *Zhao Jianyi* edition retains 狸 (*li*); (2) the missing character is emended to 狸 based on the *Shiwen* edition; (3) the *Shide Tang* edition reads 狸, while this follows the original *Shiwen* text; (4) the character 所 is deleted following the *Zhao* edition.

Jiang Lümen visited Ji Che and said: "The Lord of Lu said to me, 'I request to receive your instruction.' Unable to decline his command, I have already told him, but I do not know whether it was appropriate. Allow me to present it again.

I said to the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, elevate those of public loyalty, and eliminate partiality and self-interest—then which of the people would dare not be harmonious!'""

**Commentary:**
*Jiang* and *Ji* are surnames; *Lümen* and *Che* are given names. These two worthies are of unknown origin, and no reliable sources clarify their identities. The Lord of Lu refers to the Marquis of Lu, a descendant of Bo Qin, though it is uncertain which duke this was. The Lord of Lu met with Lümen and requested instruction on governing the state. Though Lümen initially declined, he could not refuse the lord’s command and thus explained the Way of governance. As he spoke hastily, he feared his words might not be perfectly apt, so he now dares to present what he said, offering it to the wise. If it is inappropriate, he humbly seeks correction.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Jiang* is also written as 蒋. *Lü* is pronounced with the initial *lì* and the final *yú*. *Miǎn* is also written as [variant], pronounced *miǎn*, or *wǎn*; Guo [Pu] pronounces it *wèn*. Jiang Lümiǎn is the name of a person. One account says: the surname is Jianglü, the given name is [variant]. Another says: the surname is Jiang, the given name is Lǚmiǎn. *Jì Chè* is also the name of a person, likely of the Jì clan. *The Lord of Lu*: some say this was Duke Ding. *Zhī zhòng* is pronounced with the initial *dīng* and the final *zhòng*.

**Commentary:**
*Ē* means "partiality." *Shú* means "who." *Jí* means "harmony." Now, the Way of governance must first require the ruler to personally embody reverence and frugality, simplicity and purity. Only then may he promote those of impartial loyalty and upright integrity, selecting forthright and selfless scholars to recommend the good and reject the flawed, jointly governing the people. Thus, the borders will be secure, the realm will be tranquil, the people will sing and strike the earth in joy—who would dare not be harmonious!

The *Shiwen* notes: *bù jí* is pronounced *jí*. The *Erya* says: "harmony." Another pronunciation is with the initial *cè* and the final *lì*. Guo [Pu] reads it as *sī yú*.

Jì Chè laughed heartily and said: "If one follows your master’s words, then in regard to the virtue of emperors and kings, it would be like the mantis raising its arms in anger to block the wheels of a chariot—it would surely be unequal to the task. Moreover, if one acts thus, one’s own position will be perilous, and the platforms from which one observes will be many. Things will gather, and those who tread in one’s footsteps will be numerous."

The first note states: One must necessarily practice reverence and frugality—not frugality born of forgetting frugality; one must necessarily elevate public-spirited loyalty—not loyalty born of forgetting loyalty. Thus, though free from partiality and self-interest, this is still insufficient to bear the burden of countering deceit and artifice.

The commentary explains: *Jújú* describes bending forward in laughter. That one must necessarily be reverent and frugal, must necessarily elevate public-spirited loyalty—these are all contrived sentiments, not the forgetfulness of the bland. Therefore, to take such words as the virtue of one who faces south [as a ruler]—how is this different from the mantis raising its arms in anger to oppose the chariot’s tracks? Using the small to imitate the great, it cannot bear the task.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Jújú* is pronounced *qíyù*. Another gloss says: the appearance of hearty laughter. *Tángláng* is pronounced *tángláng*. *Chēyì* is pronounced *zhé*. ◎ Qing Fan’s case: The *Shiwen*’s gloss of *yì* as *zhé* is correct. *Zhé* means chariot tracks. The ancient character *zhé* was interchangeable with *yì*. The *Stratagems of the Warring States* reads: "wherever the chariot tracks reach," with the note: *yì* is pronounced *zhé*. (The *Shuowen* has no *zhé* seal; *zhé* is simply *chè*.) The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the "Annals of Emperor Wen," reads: "tying chariot tracks upon the road," with the note also pronouncing it *zhé*. The *Book of Han*, in the "Annals of Emperor Wen," writes *jiézhé*, which serves as evidence. *Bùshèng* is pronounced *shēng*. The note concurs.

The second note states: All this is to place oneself in a lofty and conspicuous position, as if on a terrace from which one may be observed.

The commentary explains: Reverence, frugality, public-spirited loyalty—these are not true forgetfulness of the bland, but rather a self-display that dazzles the multitude. Since one’s position is already perilously high, collapse and ruin are inevitable, just as a towering terrace, though travelers may gaze upon it, will soon crumble.

The *Shiwen* notes: *Zìwéijù* is pronounced *qíjù*. The original text also writes *chǔ*. ◎ Lu Wenchang says: The present text writes *chǔ*. *Guāntái* is pronounced *gǔluàn*. The note concurs.

The third note states: This will cause things to exceed their inherent allotment of nature, straining and overreaching to attach themselves.

The commentary explains: When a terrace stands high and distant, people vie to gaze upon it, and those who stand and walk multiply; things compete to gather there. ◎ Jia Shifu says: "Many terraces" means that the people, observing the model and receiving the law, find the affairs onerous. Guo Xiang’s punctuation, taking "perilous" with "its terraces," is likely in error.

The fourth note states: Raising one’s feet to tread in others’ tracks is to be unsettled in one’s own proper step.

The commentary explains: When one’s display stirs things, they become unsettled in their allotted nature, and thus those who lift their feet to tread in others’ tracks, stretching on tiptoe, are many.

Jiang Lümen, startled, said: "I am utterly at a loss regarding your master’s words. Nevertheless, I wish to hear the drift of your words."

The annotations state:
*觑觑* (qūqū) describes a startled appearance.
*茫* (máng) means "to see nothing." Upon suddenly hearing lofty discourse, one is startled and alarmed; pondering it, one fails to comprehend, hence the bewilderment.

*Fanqie* glosses:
*《觑觑》* as *xǔnì* (許逆) or *shēngzé* (生責) in alternate readings. Some say it means "the appearance of alarm and fear."
*《茫若》* is sometimes written as *芒* (máng). Guo Xiang reads it as *wǔdàng* (武荡).

The annotations further explain:
*风* (fēng) means "teaching." What I previously said was deeply contrary to principle; I now wish for a single word that might serve as instruction.

◎ Yu Yue says: *风* should be read as *凡* (fán), meaning "to speak of its general outline." *风* originally derives from *凡* phonetically, hence they may be used interchangeably.

Ji Che said: "When the great sage governs the world, he sways and stirs the people’s hearts, causing them to form teachings and change customs. He entirely eradicates their harmful intentions and advances their solitary aspirations, as if their nature acted of itself, and the people remain unaware of how this comes to be. If this is so, how could he be like one who, as a brother to Yao and Shun, teaches the people, treating them as younger siblings in the primordial chaos? Rather, he desires to align with virtue, and the heart abides in stillness."

The commentary explains:
Each aspiration has its own direction and cannot be imitated. Thus, when he follows their natural swaying and sways them, though he sways, it is not an act of doing; when he follows their natural stirring and stirs them, though he stirs, it is not motion. Therefore, their harmful intentions are extinguished of themselves, their solitary aspirations advance of themselves, teachings are established and customs transformed, all without trace. They tread their nature and act of themselves, unaware of how it comes to be, all saying, "It is simply our nature."

The annotations state:
When the sage governs the world, he greatly accords with all beings. He rides their natural swaying to establish the law and follows their natural stirring to form teachings. Thus, teachings are accomplished without visible traces, customs are transformed without the people’s awareness. All eradicate their harmful intentions and cultivate their solitary aspirations. Unmoved by external things, they act as if by nature itself; following their nature in movement, they do not know how it comes to be. *举* (jǔ) means "all."

*Fanqie* glosses:
*《举灭》* *举* means "all."
*《闷然》* is read as *mèn* (门).

The commentary explains:
*溟涬* (míngxìng) means "most noble." He does not deign to defer excessively to Yao and Shun but rather treats them as brothers.

The annotations state:
*溟涬* means "most noble." If one governs the people by the former method, governance returns to ancient purity, and all beings attain their nature. How could one need to uniquely honor Yao and Shun and treat them as elder brothers? This manner of yielding and deference does not yield to Tang and Yu.

*Fanqie* glosses:
*《岂兄》* The Yuanjia edition reads *岂足* ("how could it be worthy").
*《溟》* is read as *míng* (亡顶).
*《涬》* is read as *xìng* (户顶).

The commentary explains:
*居* (jū) means "not to pursue external things." If the heart does not abide, virtue will not be aligned.

The annotations state:
*居* means "to settle and stabilize." When the heart races beyond its proper bounds, it clashes with external things; when it is empty, level, still, and settled, the myriad conditions become one. Thus, the difference or sameness of conditions lies in the stillness or disturbance of the heart. Therefore, if one wishes to align with Yao and Shun in virtue, one must first settle the heart.

The editor notes:
The three characters *举皆也* ("*举* means 'all'") were mistakenly included from the *Shiwen* and have been deleted according to the Zhao Jianyi edition.

Zigong traveled south to Chu and, returning to Jin, passed by Hanyin. He saw an old man preparing garden beds, digging a tunnel to enter the well, holding a jar to draw water and irrigate. He toiled strenuously, yet his achievement was meager.

Zigong said: "There is a device here that can irrigate a hundred beds in a single day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not desire it?"

The annotations state:
The south of the water is called *阴* (yīn). A place for growing vegetables is called *圃* (pǔ). The area within the ridges is called *畦* (qí). *隧* (suì) means "underground passage." *搰搰* (húhú) describes the appearance of exertion. *丈人* (zhàngrén) is a term of respect for an elder. Zigong traveled south to the land of Jing and Chu, passing by the south bank of the Han River, where he exchanged words with the old man. The ebb and flow of their dialogue is fully recorded in the text. Zhuangzi used these two worthies to illustrate the praise of primordial chaos.

*Fanqie* glosses:
*《圃》* is read as *bùhù* (布户) or *bù* (布). Li (Yun) says: "A place for vegetables is called *圃*."
*《畦》* is read as *hùguī* (户圭). Li (Yun) says: "The area within the ridges is called *畦*." The *Shuowen* states: "Fifty *mu* is called *畦*."
*《隧》* is read as *suì* (遂). Li (Yun) says: "It means 'path.'"

《瓮》 is read as *wēngsòng* (乌送) *fǎn*. The character is also written as *瓮*.

《搰搰》 is read as *kǔgǔ* (苦骨) *fǎn*; Xu and Li read it as *kǔhuá* (苦滑) *fǎn*; Guo reads it as *hūhuá* (忽滑) *fǎn*. It describes the appearance of exertion. Another pronunciation is *húmò* (胡没) *fǎn*.

[Commentary 2] *械* (xiè) refers to machinery. Upon seeing the elder expend much effort for little result, Zigong sought to instruct him in the use of machinery, hoping to achieve greater results with less labor. Thus, he offered his sincere advice, though he did not know whether the elder would accept it.

[Fanqie glosses]
《有械》 is read as *hùjiè* (户戒) *fǎn*. The *Zilin* writes it as *械*. Li says: "It means 'implements.'"
《浸》 is read as *zǐzhèn* (子鸩) *fǎn*. Sima says: "It means 'to irrigate.'"

[Collation Notes]
(1) *Quēwù* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, which includes the character *机* below.
(2) The character *户* is amended following the Shide Tang edition and the original *Shiwen* text.
(3) *械* is suspected to be a corruption of another character.

The gardener looked up and asked, "What do you mean?"

Zigong replied, "Carve wood into a machine: the rear is heavy, the front is light. When you pull the handle, it draws water as swiftly as boiling over. It is called a *槔* (gāo)."

The gardener flushed with anger, his expression turning to scornful laughter, and said, "I have heard from my teacher that those who possess machinery must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor a mechanical mind. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete; when purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit’s vitality is unsettled. One whose spirit’s vitality is unsettled is not borne by the Dao. I am not ignorant of such things—I am ashamed to do them."

【一】**Subcommentary:** *Naihe* means "how" (an inquiry into his method).

**Exegesis:** *Ang* (昂) is read as *yang* (仰).

【二】**Subcommentary:** *Ji* (机) means "pivot." When one lifts and draws the water, irrigating as if pulling, the speed is discussed in terms of its swiftness—like boiling water surging and bubbling. With its front light and rear heavy, it is what is now called a *jiegao* (桔槔, well-sweep).

**Exegesis:** *Qie shui* (挈水) is read as *koujie* (口节) in reverse. *Ruo chou* (若抽) is read as *chiliu* (敕留). Li [Yun] says: "to draw." Sima [Biao] and Cui [Zhuan] write it as *liu* (流). *Shu ru* (数如) is read as *suojiao* (所角) by Xu [Shen] and *suolu* (所录) by others. *Yi tang* (泆汤) is read as *yi* (逸). Some versions write it as *yi* (溢). Li [Yun] says: "as swiftly as boiling water overflowing." Sima [Biao] writes it as *yidang* (佚荡), also describing its rapid back-and-forth motion like unrestrained swaying. *Yidang* (佚荡) means "reckless abandon." *Gao* (槔) is also written as *qiao* (桥) or *gao* (皋), all pronounced *gao* (羔). Xu [Shen] reads it as *juqiao* (居桥). Sima [Biao] and Li [Yun] say: "a *jiegao* (桔槔)."

【三】**Commentary:** What is used in its proper time is indeed pure and complete. This man seeks to cultivate purity and completeness but clings to oneness and upholds antiquity, missing the essential point.

**Subcommentary:** Those who possess mechanical devices must engage in mechanical tasks; those who engage in mechanical tasks must harbor a mechanical mind. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity, whiteness, and simplicity are not fully realized. When purity, whiteness, and simplicity are not fully realized, the spirit hangs in suspense, its arising and ceasing unsettled. When unsettled, it is not borne by the Great Dao, and thus he is ashamed to act. This is one who has not yet embodied true cultivation, merely clinging to oneness and guarding whiteness.

**Exegesis:** *Wu shi* (吾师) refers to Laozi.

**Collation Notes:** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *ang* (昂) as *yang* (仰). (2) *Que wu* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, which writes *wei* (为) as *jie* (桔).

Zigong was struck dumb with shame, lowering his head and making no reply.

【一】**Subcommentary:** *Man* (瞒) describes a look of embarrassment. Having misspoken, he did not know how to respond.

**Exegesis:** *Man* (瞒) is read as *wuban* (武版) in reverse, or *mengan* (亡安). The *Zilin* says: "a level gaze." Li [Yun] reads it as *tiandian* (天典), meaning "a look of shame." One pronunciation is *men* (门), or *mogan* (亡干). Sima [Biao] writes it as *wu* (怃), pronounced *wu* (武). Cui [Zhuan] writes it as *fu* (抚).

After a pause, the gardener said, "What are you doing here?"

【一】**Subcommentary:** *You xian* (有闲) means "after a moment." *Xi* (奚) means "what." He asked Zigong: "Whose disciple are you? What do you study?"

Zigong replied, "I am a disciple of Confucius."

【一】**Subcommentary:** He answered: "a disciple of Master Ni."

◎**Qingfan’s Note:** The *Yiqiejing yin yi* (25) cites Sima [Biao] as saying: "a disciple." The *Exegesis* omits this.

The gardener said, "Are you not that one who broadly studies to rival the sages, who struts about to overshadow the masses, who plays the lone zither and sings mournful songs to sell your name throughout the world? You should be forgetting your spirit and qi, casting off your bodily form—then you might approach it! Yet you cannot even govern yourself—how could you have leisure to govern the world? Be gone! Do not hinder my work!"

**【一】Subcommentary:** *Yu yu* (于于) refers to flattery. It means: you, with your vast learning and extensive knowledge, imitate the sages; with fawning flattery, you overshadow all things. Sitting alone, you pluck the zither and sing, modulating your voice in mournful sighs, clinging to these sagely traces to sell your reputation, traveling through the states, traversing the world.

**Exegesis:** *Yu yu* (于于) is read as written. Some versions write it as *yu xu* (唹吁), with the same pronunciation. Sima [Biao] says: "an appearance of boastful exaggeration." Another says: "an appearance of practicing benevolence and kindness." *Yi gai zhong* (以盖众): Sima’s version writes *gai* (盖) as *shan* (善).

◎**Jia Shifu’s Note:** In *Responding to Emperors and Kings*, it says: "In sleep, he is leisurely; when awake, he is *yu yu* (于于)." The *Shuowen* states: "*Yu* (于) means *yu* (于), depicting the unfolding of qi." Thus, *yu yu* (于于) is the same as *yu yu* (于于), meaning "leisurely."

**【二】Commentary:** If one does not forget and does not cast off, then there is no way to approach the nearness of the Dao.

**Subcommentary:** *Ji* (几) means "near." You forget your spirit and qi, cast off your bodily form; only when both body and mind are forgotten can you then nearly approach the Dao.

**Exegesis:** *Duo* (堕) is read as *xu gui* (许规反).

**【三】Subcommentary:** *Er* (而) means "you." *Fa* (乏) means "to neglect." If all things govern themselves, then the world is ordered; if one uses oneself to govern things, then great chaos ensues. With Zigong’s virtue, he is not yet sufficient to govern himself—how could he respond to the world’s summons? It is proper that he depart swiftly and not hinder my work.

**Exegesis:** *Wu fa* (无乏): *fa* (乏) means "to neglect."

Zigong, humbled and discomfited, lost his composure, and only after walking thirty *li* did he recover.

**【一】Subcommentary:** *Bei zou* (卑陬) is an appearance of shame. *Xu xu* (顼顼) is an appearance of self-loss. Having been rebuked, he lost his countenance; after walking thirty *li*, he gradually returned to normal.

**Exegesis:** *Bei zou* (卑陬) is read as *zou hou* (走侯反), or in Xu’s version as *ce liu* (侧留反). Li [Yi] says: "*Bei zou* (卑陬) is an appearance of fear and shame." Another says: "an appearance of lost composure." *Xu xu* (顼顼): some versions write it as *xu xu* (旭旭), read as *xu yu* (许玉反). Li [Yi] says: "an appearance of self-loss."

His disciples said: "Who was that man just now? Why did you, Master, change your expression and lose your composure upon seeing him, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?"

**【一】Subcommentary:** *Fan* (反) means "to return." Zigong’s disciples called him "Master." "That man we just saw—what arts or learning does he cultivate, that upon a single glance, you lost your usual composure, your spirit and qi unsettled for the entire morning?" His disciples, finding this strange, thus questioned him.

**Exegesis:** *Xiang zhi* (向之) is read as *xu liang* (许亮反). Some versions write it as *xiang* (乡), with the same pronunciation. The same applies hereafter.

He replied: "At first, I believed there was but one such person in the world, unaware there could be another like him.

I have heard from the Master that in affairs, one seeks what is proper; in achievements, one seeks completion. To expend little effort yet attain great results—this is the Way of the sage.

Yet now it is not so. Those who hold to the Dao attain wholeness of virtue; those with wholeness of virtue attain wholeness of form; those with wholeness of form attain wholeness of spirit. Wholeness of spirit—this is the Way of the sage.

Entrusted with life, they move among the people yet remain unaware of their destination, vast and perfectly complete! The pursuit of profit, cunning, and skill must be forgotten from such a one’s heart.

As for this man, if his will does not align, he does not go; if his heart does not consent, he does not act. Though the world praises him and he obtains what he deems right, he remains aloof and unmoved; though the world condemns him and he loses what he deems right, he remains untroubled and unyielding. The world’s praise or blame neither adds to nor detracts from him—such is the person of perfect virtue!

As for me, I am but one tossed by the winds and waves."

[1] [Annotation] This refers to Confucius.

[2] [Exegesis] In the past, when I received instruction, only the Master stood unrivaled throughout the world. Now, having encountered this Venerable One, I find his Dao and virtue even more profound and far-reaching—thus my humility and inability to remain composed. Since I have yet to grasp the true and the false, I truly regard him as wiser than Confucius.

[Phonetic Gloss] *Fuyou* (復有): read as *fúyòu*.
*Furen* (夫人): read as *fú*; same below.

[3] [Annotation] The Way of the sage is simply to employ the hearts of the common people.

[Exegesis] Affairs are deemed proper when they accord with the times, and achievements are deemed complete when they attain their ends. Thus, when little effort yields great results, this is the mechanism of timely success. Zigong recounted what he had heard in the past, taking it to be the Way of the sage.

[4] [Annotation] This is the Way of the sage-king, not the Way of this man. Zigong, hearing his discourse on provisional cultivation, submitted to it, unaware that the one of pure whiteness moves in harmony with the world.

[Exegesis] Now, when the Venerable One questioned me, it was not like this. He said: One who holds fast to the Dao suffers no lack in virtue; one with wholeness of virtue suffers no harm in form; one with wholeness of form attains wholeness of spirit. Wholeness of spirit—this is to dwell among men, entrusting life to the world, moving alongside all things yet remaining unaware of one’s destination, vast and unfathomable, beyond measure. Thus, his conduct is pure and harmonious, his virtue and Dao perfectly complete, such that profit, cunning, and skill cannot enter his heart. This is the Way of the sage, not the art of provisional cultivation. Zigong, failing to awaken, mistakenly offered such words.

[Exegesis]
《茫乎》: *máng hū*, read with *mò gāng* as the fanqie.
《之心》: *xīn* ("heart/mind"), or in some versions *dào* ("Dao/Way").

[Chapter 5]
[Commentary] These are the followers of Song Rongzi, yet they do not suffice for wholeness of virtue. Zigong’s delusion, drowned in this man, is like Liezi’s heart intoxicated by Jixian.

[Exegesis] *Áo* is the bearing of arrogance and boastfulness; *tǎng* is the appearance of nonattachment. The Venerable One’s will and qi are pure and unadorned, unburdened by cunning or skill, his heart holding few desires, unconcerned with action. Though the whole world might praise him, calling him virtuous, he knows it brings no benefit and does not so much as glance at it. Though the whole world might slander him, ruining his reputation, he understands it causes no harm and does not accept it. Unmoved by praise or blame, he may be called a man of whole virtue. Though water’s nature is clear, when wind stirs, waves rise; if my heart is unsettled, it resembles those waves—hence, they are called the people of wind and waves.

Guo’s commentary states: These are the followers of Song Rongzi, yet they do not suffice for wholeness of virtue. Zigong’s delusion, drowned in this man, is like Liezi’s heart intoxicated by Jixian.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*"Yù zhī"* (誉之) is pronounced *yú*; same below.
*"Áorán"* (謷然) is read with the fanqie *wǔ gāo fǎn*.

*"Tǎngrán"* (傥然) is also written as *dǎng* (党) in some editions.

[The traveler] returned to Lu and reported to Confucius.
Confucius said: "That man was but feigning the arts of the Hun Dun clan.
He knows one thing but not two;
he cultivates his inner self but neglects his outer.
One who is lucid and enters simplicity, who acts without contrivance and returns to uncarved wood, who embodies nature and embraces the spirit, roaming amidst the world of men—would you truly be startled by him?
Moreover, the arts of the Hun Dun clan—how could you or I presume to comprehend them!"

**[1] [Commentary]**
Because he turns his back on the present and faces antiquity, ashamed to engage in worldly affairs, we know he is no true Hun Dun.

**[Exegesis]**
Zigong traveled from Lu to Chu, then returned to Lu and recounted the encounter to Confucius.
Now, *hun dun* means "without distinctions."
Since he turns from the present toward antiquity, we know he does not practice the true arts of the Hun Dun clan.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*"Hún"* (浑) is read with the fanqie *hú běn fǎn*.
*"Dùn"* (沌) is read with the fanqie *tú běn fǎn*.
*"Bèi jīn"* (背今) is pronounced *pèi*.

**[2] [Commentary]**
He merely recognizes the simplicity of ancient cultivation and embracing the unhewn, yet does not understand the ease of adapting to the times and responding to things.

**[Exegesis]**
"Knows one thing" refers to clinging to antiquity without change.
"Not knowing two" means being unable to follow the present and adapt to circumstances.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*"Zhī yì"* (之易) is read with the fanqie *yǐ chǐ fǎn*.

**[3] [Commentary]**
The true Hun Dun does not cultivate at all—how could he treat inner and outer as distinct and cultivate only one side?

**[Exegesis]**
Holding to the Dao and guarding simplicity is cultivating the inner.
Being unable to adapt to the times and respond to change is neglecting the outer.

**[4] [Commentary]**
This is the true Hun Dun: he moves with the world without losing himself, so though he roams amidst the world of men, his traces are obliterated—would he necessarily startle you?

**[Exegesis]**
When the heart’s wisdom is clear and attains the essence of simplicity;
when effortless tranquility returns to the source of uncarved wood;
when one awakens to true nature and embraces pure essence, mingling with the dust of the world—then even rivers and seas, forests and marshes, birds and beasts are not alarmed, so how could men be startled?
Yet it says, "Would you truly be startled?"—this makes clear that one *need not* be startled.

◎ Yu Yue says: *Gù* (固) should be read as *hú* (胡). Since *hú* and *gù* share the same ancient pronunciation, they are interchangeable. *Rǔ jiāng hú jīng yé* (汝将胡惊邪) means "Would you be startled upon encountering the true Hun Dun?" Guo Xiang’s commentary—"He moves with the world without losing himself, so though he roams amidst the world of men, his traces are obliterated—would he necessarily startle you?"—perfectly captures the meaning. In ancient texts, the character *hú* (胡) is sometimes written as *gù* (故). Examples include the *Luxury and Waste* chapter of the *Guanzi*: "The lord was about to depart, so I did not see him off," and the *Exaltation of Worthies* chapter of the *Mozi*: "Thus, he did not examine the root of governing through exalting worthies." Both instances demonstrate *gù* being used for *hú*. The Zheng Xuan commentary on the *Duke Ai’s Questions* chapter of the *Book of Rites* states: "*Gù* means *therefore*." Thus, using *gù* for *hú* is akin to using *gù* for *hú*.

**[5] [Commentary]**
To him, it is "him"; to us, it is "us." The Hun Dun is profoundly identical—who can comprehend it? What is comprehended is merely its traces.

**[Exegesis]**
The Hun Dun is without intention, transcending wisdom and thought. Even if sages and worthies were uniquely perceptive, how could they presume to comprehend it? This reveals its unfathomable depth, pushing it beyond the realm of sentiment and intent.

Zhun Mang was traveling east to the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea.
Yuan Feng asked: "Where are you going?"

**[1] [Exegesis]**
*Zhūn* means "pure." *Yuan* is a small wind, or else the great whirlwind *fuyao*. *Bin* means "shore"; the *Great Abyss* is the sea. Zhun Mang and Yuan Feng are both allegorical figures. Zhuangzi uses these two to illustrate the Great Dao, so he feigns them as host and guest, meeting on the sea’s edge.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*"Zhūn"* (谆) is read with the fanqie *zhī lún fǎn*, or else *shù lún fǎn*.
*"Máng"* (芒) is sometimes written as *máng* (茫), pronounced *wǔ gāng fǎn*.
Li [Yi] says: "Gazing at him, he seems earnest; examining him, he seems obscure—hence the name Zhun Mang." Another says: "It is a personal name." Yet another says: "It is mist."
*"Dà hè"* (大壑) is read with the fanqie *huǒ gè fǎn*.
Li [Yi] says: "The *Great Abyss* is the Eastern Sea."
*"Yuàn fēng"* (苑风) is also written as *wǎn* (宛), pronounced *yú ruǎn fǎn* in Xu’s edition.
Li [Yi] says: "It means small, referring to one who roams the world of men." Another says: "Yuan Feng is a personal name." Another says: "It is the great whirlwind *fuyao*."
*"Zhī bīn"* (之滨) is pronounced *bīn*.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: In the *Exegetical Notes*, *yuàn* (苑) is also written as *wǎn* (宛)—*yuàn* and *wǎn* are the same character. The *Stimulating Transformation* chapter of the *Huainanzi* reads: "The form is *yuàn* while the spirit is robust." Gao You’s commentary: "*Yuàn* means withered illness; *yuàn* is read like *wǎn* in Nanyang."

**[2] [Exegesis]**
*Xī* (奚) means "what." *Zhī* (之) means "to go."

"May I ask, Zhun Mang, where do you journey?"
He replied: "I am going to the *Great Abyss*."

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Intending to travel to the Eastern Sea.

"For what purpose?" he asked.

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Further inquiring what he seeks there.

He replied: "As for the *Great Abyss*—such is its nature: pour into it and it is never full; draw from it and it never runs dry. I shall wander there."

**[1] [Exegesis]**
The great sea is vast and boundless, its depths unfathomable. A hundred rivers flow into it yet it does not overflow; the Tail Socket drains it yet it does not run dry. This analogy applies to the supreme principle, and its meaning is likewise so. Thus, though he journeys to the azure deep, in truth he roams the mind in the great Dao.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Draw from it* (酌焉) is also written as *take from it* (取焉).

Yuan Feng said: "Does the Master have no intention toward the *horizontal-eyed people*? I wish to hear of sagely governance."

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Within the Five Phases, only the people have horizontal eyes, hence they are called the *horizontal-eyed people*. Moreover, Zhun Mang’s eastern journey takes him to the edge of the *Great Abyss*, where he observes its depth and distance to discern the methods of governance. Yuan Feng, having perceived this intent, thus posed the question: "Does the Master truly have no concern for the black-headed people?"

"I wish to hear of the methods of sagely transformation."

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Horizontal-eyed people* (横目之民): Li [Yi] says: "They belong to the class of insects, and he desires to govern them."
*Wish to hear* (愿闻): Some versions follow Sima [Biao]’s text, writing *ask* (问) instead; the same applies below.
*Sagely governance* (圣治): Pronounced *zhí lì*; the same applies below.

Zhun Mang said: "Sagely governance? Offices are established and measures implemented without losing their appropriateness; the capable are promoted without misjudging their abilities. **[1]** All circumstances are fully perceived, and actions are taken accordingly; **[2]** words and deeds proceed naturally, and the world is transformed. **[3]** With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all arrive together—this is called sagely governance. **[4]**"

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Commands are issued and offices established, each attaining its proper convenience; the worthy are selected and recommended without misjudging their talents. Thus, the world attains great peace, and the constant norms are ordered—such is the method of sagely governance.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Offices established* (官施): Pronounced *shǐ zhī* or *shǐ zhì*. Sima [Biao] says: "Policies are implemented and teachings disseminated, each attaining its proper place."

**[2] [Commentary]**
All are employed according to their nature.

**[Exegesis]**
Divergent paths and multifarious affairs abound, for steps vary with the times, and customs differ across ages. Thus, in governance, nothing precedes allowing things to follow their nature. One must observe their circumstances and discern their actions, then proceed in accordance with them—thus, nothing will be amiss.

**[3] [Commentary]**
If things are made to follow [the ruler], they will not be transformed.

**[Exegesis]**
All matters of implementation and teachings issued are entrusted to things themselves, not imposed by the ruler. Thus, the black-haired people of the world naturally follow transformation.

**[4] [Commentary]**
This means that with a gesture or glance, the people each attain their nature—this is because they are allowed to act of their own accord.

**[Exegesis]**
*Twist* (挠) means *move*. With a motion of the hand or a glance, the four directions submit, and the myriad states pay homage. Such is the efficacy of sagely governance. Some versions write *chin* (颐) instead, meaning that with a movement of the jaw, the four directions all submit. Here, three figures are distinguished: the sagely, the virtuous, and the spirit-like. The above concerns sagely governance; below, the two others—virtuous and spirit-like—are listed in order.

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Hand-twist* (手挠): The small *fanqie* reading is *ér*, and another reading is *liǎo*. Sima [Biao] says: it means *to move*. Another explanation: it refers to directing the four directions with a gesture. *Glance-direct* (顾指): read as written. Xiang [Xiu] says: *Glance-direct* means governing through gestures and glances. Some pronounce it as *yí* (颐). The original text also writes *yí*, with the *fanqie* reading *zhī*, meaning to raise the jaw and direct. ◎Qing Fan’s note: *Hand-twist* and *glance-direct* form a parallel structure. The commentary’s *gesture* corresponds to *hand-twist*, while *glance* corresponds to *glance-direct*; thus, the exegesis explains the four characters by separating *moving the hand* and *raising the eyes*. If, as Xiang [Xiu] says, *glance-direct* means *directing with gestures and glances*, the meaning is lost. *Glance-direct* means to glance at someone while directing them. Zuo Si’s *Wu Capital Rhapsody* says, *"Plucking banners as if at a glance-direct,"* and Liu Kui’s annotation: *"It means directing as one wishes."* Here, *glance-direct* shares the same meaning as the *Book of Han*’s *Biography of Gong Yu*: *"Directing with the eyes and commanding with qi"* (Yan Shigu’s annotation: *"Moving the eyes to indicate objects, emitting qi to command people."*).

**[1]**
"I wish to hear of the *virtuous person*."

**[Exegesis]**
The previous discussion of sagely governance has already been amply explained; the meaning of the *virtuous person* is what I deeply wish to hear.

[The Master] said: "The *virtuous person* dwells without thought, moves without deliberation, and harbors no right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. When all within the four seas share in its benefits, this is called *joy*; when all are provided for, this is called *peace*. They are forlorn, like an infant who has lost its mother; disoriented, like a traveler who has lost the Way. Wealth and resources are abundant, yet they know not whence they come; food and drink are sufficient, yet they know not from where they derive—this is called the *bearing of the virtuous person*."

**[Commentary]**
They follow nature alone.

**[Exegesis]**
In profound accord with the Dao’s realm, they attain what is without attainment—thus they are called *virtuous persons*. The *virtuous person* concentrates their spirit and sits in solemn stillness, utterly devoid of thought. Even when responding to things and enacting transformation, they never engage in scheming or deliberation.

**[Commentary]**
They harbor no right or wrong in their hearts but entrust it to the world.

**[Exegesis]**
Embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue, they forget both self and others—how could they harbor right or wrong, or contain good and evil?

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Beauty/ugliness* (美恶): read *wū-lù*.

**[Commentary]**
They have no self-serving inclinations.

**[Exegesis]**
The *virtuous person*’s beneficence is vast and far-reaching, pervading all beings. Thus, when wealth and resources are shared by all within the four seas, and provision is given to the myriad people without distinction, the entire world rejoices, and all under heaven is at peace. ◎Qing Fan’s note: *Called joy* and *as peace* form a parallel structure. *Called* (谓) here means *to be*. In ancient texts, *called* and *to be* were used interchangeably.

**[Exegesis]**
An infant who has lost its mother is forlorn, with no one to rely on; a traveler who has lost the Way is disoriented, with no place to turn. These two analogies illustrate the *virtuous person*.

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Forlorn* (怊乎): pronounced *chāo*. The *Character Forest* says: it means *disconsolate*. Xu [Shen] reads it *chí-yáo*; Guo [Pu] reads it *tiáo*. *Disoriented* (傥乎): pronounced *chǎng-dǎng*. Sima’s edition writes it as □.

**[Five] [Commentary]**
Virtue is the trace of the spirit-person, hence it is called *deportment*.

**[Exegesis]**
With few desires and bounded by one’s allotted share, resources and provisions are ever sufficient; not coveting rich flavors, food and drink are taken in moderation; with no demands upon life and fate, one knows not whence they come. These threads gather into the preceding meaning, hence it is called *the deportment of the virtuous person*.

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Deportment of the virtuous person* (德人之容): pronounced *yáng-xiōng*. Some say: according to the commentary, it should read *guest* (客).

“Would that I might hear of the *spirit-person*.”

**[One] [Commentary]**
Would that I might hear of that by which they leave traces.

**[Exegesis]**
Virtue is but the trace of the spirit-person; would that I might hear of that by which they leave traces.

It is said:
“The supreme spirit rides upon light, and with form perishes and vanishes. This is called *illuminating the vast expanse*. Giving free rein to fate and exhausting one’s nature, heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve and vanish. The myriad things return to their nature—this is called *profound obscurity*.”

**[One] [Commentary]**
To *ride upon light* is to be without light.

**[Exegesis]**
*Rides* (乘) means *employs*. *Light* (光) means *wisdom*. The highest spirit-person employs wisdom to illuminate things; though their brilliance may be like that of the sun and moon, it illuminates and then vanishes. Body and senses are cast aside, heart and form both abandoned—thus it is said *with form perishes and vanishes*.

**[Two] [Commentary]**
To be without self and yield to things, empty and void of all attachment, is not darkness or obstruction.

**[Exegesis]**
Their wisdom encompasses the myriad things, their clarity surpassing the Three Luminaries; no hidden thing is not illumined—how could this not be *vast*?

**[Three] [Commentary]**
When nature is exhausted and fate fulfilled, heaven and earth rejoice. When affairs do not obstruct joy, there are no affairs.

**[Exegesis]**
To fathom the utmost of life and fate, to exhaust the nature of generation and transformation—thus they abide between heaven and earth yet are never not carefree and joyful. Having grasped the illusory emptiness of self and things, the myriad affairs dissolve and vanish.

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Heaven and earth rejoice* (天地樂): pronounced *luò*. The commentary is the same.
*Dissolve and vanish* (銷亡): Xu pronounces it *xiāo*.

**[Four] [Commentary]**
When nature returns, there is *profound obscurity* without trace.

**[Exegesis]**
To forget illumination yet illuminate—illumination rises with the Three Luminaries in brilliance. To forget life yet live—life rejoices alongside the Two Modes. Thus they perceive the myriad things’ return to their origin, witness the four births’ restoration of fate, and so merge in chaos without division, profoundly one with the Dao.

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Profound obscurity* (混冥): pronounced *hú-běn*.

Menwu Gui and Chizhang Manji observed the troops of King Wu.

Chizhang Manji said: “Are they not inferior to the Yu clan? Thus they encounter this calamity.”

**[One] [Exegesis]**
Men and Chizhang are surnames. Wu Gui and Manji are given names. Two thousand five hundred men constitute a *troop*; *troop* means *multitude*. When King Wu attacked Zhou, his forces crossed the Meng Ford, and the two men observed together.

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Menwu Gui* (門無鬼): Sima’s edition writes *Wuwei* (無畏), stating: *Men* is the surname; *Wuwei* is the style.
*Chizhang Man* (赤張滿): Some editions write *Pu* (蒲).
*Ji* (稽): pronounced *gǔ-xī*. Li says: *Men* and *Chizhang* are surnames; *Wu Gui* and *Manji* are given names.

**[Two] [Exegesis]**
*Encounter* (離) means *suffer*. Yu Shun governed the age with yielding deference; King Wu saved the world with shield and spear. Between yielding deference and shield and spear, the disparity is vast. Judging by this, one arrives at the remark of inferiority. Moreover, arms are inauspicious instruments—hence they suffer the misfortune of slaughter.

Menwu Gui said: “Was the world made orderly by the Yu clan’s governance, or was it disordered and then made orderly?”

**[Exegesis on Characters]**
*Jūnzhì* (均治): pronounced *zhí-lì*. Below and in the commentary, *jūnzhì* is the same.
*Zhī yú* (之与): pronounced *yú*. Some editions write *yé* (邪).
*Fù hé* (复何): pronounced *fú-yòu*. The same in the following chapter’s commentary.
*Yáng* (疡): pronounced *yáng*. Li says: a head wound. The wound is used as a metaphor for disorder, seeking the remedy of the Yu clan to govern it. Sima says: *bǐyáng* (疕疡).
◎ Wang Yinzhi notes: *Yào* (药) was anciently read as *yào* (曜), its sound akin to *liáo* (疗) (see *Tángyùn Zhèng*). *Fāngyán* states: *yáo* (愮) means to cure. The regions of Jiang, Xiang, Jiao, and Hui call medical treatment *yáo* (愮), or *liáo* (疗). The commentary notes: *yáo* (愮) is pronounced *yào* (曜). It shares an ancient graph with *yào* (药). Thus, the *Shènjiàn*’s *Súxián* chapter says: “*Yào* (药) means *liáo* (疗).” The *Zuǒzhuàn* of Duke Xiāng’s thirty-first year reads: “It would be better to hear and *yào* (药) it.” The *Jiāyǔ*’s *Zhènglùn* chapter is the same, with Wang Su’s commentary: “*Yào* (药) means *liáo* (疗).” In the *Shījīng*’s *Dàyǎ* *Bǎn* chapter, “beyond saving by *yào* (药),” the *Hánshī Wàizhuàn* writes *yào* (药) as *liáo* (疗). The graphs for *yào* (药) and *liáo* (疗) were anciently interchangeable in meaning.
*Huànchuāng* (患创): pronounced *chū-liáng*.

**[Exegesis]**
**[1] [Commentary]**
The two sages both governed because of disorder, so yielding deference and the use of arms were merely differences of the times—there was no superiority or inferiority between them.

**[Exegesis]**
*Jūn* (均) means *píng* (平), “level.” If the world were at great peace, with all things in accord with principle, why would there be need for Yu Shun to establish laws and govern it? It was only because Yao’s years were waning and his virtue daily declining that he yielded to Chonghua, entrusting him with the task of ordering it.

**[1] [Commentary]**
When the world is level and governed, the wishes of each are fulfilled—why then calculate the virtue of the Yu clan and elevate him as ruler? Xu Wugui’s words are correct.

**[Exegesis]**
When the realm is clear and harmonious, and the aspirations of all are satisfied, why deliberate on the virtue of the Yu clan and elevate him as ruler? This grasps the meaning of Wugui’s words, affirming their reason.

**[2] [Commentary]**
The world was all afflicted by wounds of disorder, hence it sought the remedy of the Yu clan.

**[Exegesis]**
*Yáng* (疡) means a head sore. When the body suffers wounds, one seeks a physician to treat them—just as when the world encounters turmoil, a sage is needed to govern it. Thus, without illness there is no physician; without disorder, there is no sage.

Chizhang Manji said: “That the world be level and governed is the wish—why then reckon with the Yu clan as ruler! The Yu clan’s remedy for sores: applying medicine to the bald, seeking a physician for the sick. The filial son, holding medicine to cure his compassionate father, his countenance scorched with anxiety—the sage feels shame at this.”

**[3] [Subcommentary]**
With hair thick as clouds, no labor is needed for adornment;
Fortunate to be free of illness, why seek a physician!
Thus, when the world is clear and at peace, there is no need for a great sage.
These two lines summarize the preceding meaning.

**[Exegesis]**
*Tu* (秃): pronounced *tumu* (吐木反).
*Ti* (): pronounced *daxi* (大细反).
Sima [Xiangru] says: it means *bi* (髲, hair).
Also pronounced *tudi* (吐帝反).
Guo [Pu] (2): reads as *mao* (毛).
Li [Xun] says: *mao* (髦) means hair.

**[4] [Annotation]**
Those who govern the world do not do so for glory.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Cao* (操) means to grasp; *xiu* (修), to order.
*Jiaoran* (燋然) describes a withered, haggard appearance.
The filial son, in treating his compassionate father, does not boast of his merit;
The sage, in rescuing the world from calamity and chaos, does not seek honor or distinction!
Such affairs are undertaken out of necessity—hence the shame.

*Ci* (赐) means to receive favor.

**[Collation]**

(2) The character *wang* (王) is emended to *zhu* (主) following the Daoist Canon edition.

The filial son does not flatter his parents; the loyal minister does not fawn upon his ruler—this is the height of ministerial and filial virtue. **[1]**

When a parent’s words are affirmed as right and their actions praised as good, the common world calls such a child unworthy. When a ruler’s words are affirmed as right and their actions praised as good, the common world calls such a minister unworthy. Yet how can one know whether this must necessarily be so? **[2]**

When the common world calls something right and one affirms it as right, calls something good and one praises it as good, one is not called a flatterer. Then does the common world truly hold parents in greater reverence and rulers in greater esteem? **[3]**

When one is told, “You speak the Way to others,” one flushes with anger. When one is told, “You flatter others,” one bristles with indignation. **[4]** Yet all one’s life one speaks the Way to others, all one’s life one flatters others—**[5]** gathering metaphors, embellishing words, assembling crowds, so that beginning and end, root and branch, never align. **[6]**

One drapes oneself in robes, arrays oneself in colors, alters one’s expression and bearing to ingratiate oneself with the age, yet does not call this flattery. One joins the crowd, harmonizes right and wrong, yet does not consider oneself one of the multitude—this is the height of folly. **[7]**

To know one’s own folly is not great folly; to know one’s own confusion is not great confusion. The truly confused never awaken in their lifetime; the truly foolish never attain clarity. **[8]**

When three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for the confused are few. When two are confused, the journey is labored and the destination unattained, for the confused prevail. Now, with the whole world confused, though I have a direction I seek, it cannot be attained. Is this not lamentable? **[9]**

**[1] [Subcommentary]**
To serve one’s parents well is filial piety. *Yu* means falsity; *chan* means deception. To seek others’ favor through improper means is called *chan*. As minister or child, in serving father or ruler, to be neither fawning nor flattering, to be utterly loyal and filial—this is the highest virtue of minister and child.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Bu yu* (不谀): pronounced *yang zhu* (羊朱反); Guo [Xiang] reads *yi fu* (贻附反).
*Bu chan* (不谄): pronounced *chi jian* (敕检反).

**[2] [Annotation]**
This is simply to defy the common world and follow ruler or parent—hence the common world calls one unworthy. Yet where lies the ultimate rightness?

**[Subcommentary]**
*Bu xiao* means “unlike.” Whether a ruler’s or parent’s words and deeds are good or bad, one blindly follows them without any thought of remonstrance—thus the common world deems one unworthy. Yet where lies the true principle?

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Bu xiao* (不肖): pronounced *xiao* (笑).

**[3] [Annotation]**
The common world does not revere ruler or parent as more exalted by following them; it does not call such compliance flattery. This shows that reverence is insufficient to command others—rather, what commands others lies in following the common world. Thus the sage never stands apart from the age but necessarily waxes and wanes with the times. In an age of emperors, he is an emperor; in an age of kings, he is a king. How could he turn his back on the common world and impose his own way?

**[Subcommentary]**
*Yan* means reverence. This clarifies the instability of defiance and compliance. When the common world calls something right or good, to remonstrate is to follow principle. Yet to defy the common world and follow one’s parents is called speaking the Way or flattery—then to defy one’s parents and follow the common world, is this not sycophancy? With both opposition and compliance, with both affirmation and negation, when defiance and compliance are empty, where lies the true principle? Moreover, to defy one’s parents and follow the common world—can this be called reverence for ruler and parent?

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Zhi dao* (之道): pronounced *dao* (导). Same below.

◎ Qing Fan’s note: "Dao-ing" people is flattering people. The *Yu Fu* chapter states, "Anticipating intentions and speaking the Dao is called flattery"—*dao* and *chan* (flattery) share the same meaning. *Xunzi*’s *Fei Gou* chapter rejects flattery and sycophancy, while *Jia Yi*’s *Xian Xing* chapter says, "The ruler favors flattery and sycophancy but detests forthright speech." *Han Shi Wai Zhuan* likewise uses *dao-yu* (Dao-flattery). *Chan* (flattery) and *dao* are phonetic transformations.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Qi you bei* (岂有背): pronounced *pei* (佩).

**[4] [Annotation]**
The common world ultimately takes majority agreement as correctness, thus calling it "Dao-flattery," which provokes displeasure and rejection.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Ze bo* (则勃): *bo* as in *bu hu* (步忽).
*Wei ji yu ren* (谓己谀人): alternate text reads *zhong ren* (众人). Below the same.
Sima [Biao] says: *Zhong ren* means ordinary people.
*Ze fu* (则怫): *fu* as in *fu fu* (符弗); Guo [Xiang] reads *fu wei* (敷谓).

**[5] [Annotation]**
Nor do they inquire into the principles of the Dao, merely seeking mutual approval.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Bo* and *fu* both denote anger. *Dao* means "to convey"—here referring to their flattery and sycophancy to please ruler and kin. The common world, when called flatterers, reacts with anger and refuses the label, yet all their lives they practice "Dao-flattery," and the whole world does the same.

**[6] [Annotation]**
Those who harmonize parables and adorn their words deserve the charge of "Dao-flattery," yet the world again uses this to win people and gather crowds—such compliance with custom is never deemed culpable.

**[Subcommentary]**
Those who align with parables and embellish with empty words attract universal pursuit, thus gathering crowds. They maintain consistency from beginning to end, aligning root and branch. Since the multitude follows them, no one is held accountable. Some texts write *pi* (譬, parable) as *bi* (璧, jade disk), meaning "to align with jade tokens."

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Xiang zuo* (相坐): *zuo* as in *cai wo* (才卧). Annotation same.

**[7] [Annotation]**
The world is utterly foolish—how can one not comply?

**[Subcommentary]**
When the Yellow Emperor hung his robes and skirts to govern all under heaven, the upper garment and lower skirt symbolized heaven and earth. Crimson and purple hues were interwoven to create splendor, employing such ornate adornments to alter appearances and ingratiate an age. Yet these vain and deceptive men are not called "Dao-flatterers"—instead, they are deemed compliant courtiers, sycophants to their lords. Such is the way they band together with the vulgar, mutually exchanging favor and reproach, trading right and wrong, all while claiming superiority over the common crowd. This is the height of folly and delusion.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Yu fu* (与夫): *fu* as in *fu* (符).

**[8] [Annotation]**
That the sages share the same Dao while the traces of emperors and kings differ is truly due to the world’s delusions, which cannot be dispelled. Thus, one must follow and yield to them.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Jie* (解) means "awakening." *Ling* (灵) means "understanding." Those who recognize such folly and delusion are sages. By following and yielding, they are not themselves deluded. The profoundly deluded are the common folk, whose minds are dim and base, ensnared by every circumstance, living their entire lives without awakening.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Bu jie* (不解): *jie* as in *xie* (蟹), or *jia mai* (佳买) in alternate pronunciation.
*Bu ling* (不灵): Some texts write *wu ling* (无灵). Sima [Biao] says: *ling* means "to comprehend."

**[9] [Annotation]**
With all under heaven utterly deluded, even if I harbor a longing for the supreme Dao, it remains unattainable in the end. Thus, Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu did no more than follow the times.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Shi* (适) means "to go." *Zhi* (致) means "to reach." *Huo* (惑) means "delusion." *Qi* (祈) means "to seek." If three travel together and one loses the way, the destination may still be reached, for clarity outweighs confusion. If two are lost, the spirit labors in vain, for delusion prevails over understanding. Now, with all under heaven deluded, though Zhuangzi seeks the supreme Dao, there is no means to attain it—how lamentable!

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Qi xiang* (祈向): *qi* as in *xu liang* (许亮). Sima [Biao] says: *qi* means "to seek."
◎ Yu Yue notes: The character *qi* (祈) is meaningless. Sima [Biao] says *qi* means "to seek," so the text might simply read, "Though I seek it..." Guo Xiang’s annotation adds the word *qing* (情, "feeling"), which is likely superfluous. *Qi* (祈) is probably a corruption of *suo* (所, "that which"), meaning: "Though I have that which I aspire to, it cannot be attained." The characters *qi* and *suo* resemble each other, hence the error. The same applies below.

**[Textual Notes]**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *dao* (道) as *dao* (导) below as well.
(2) *Que wu* (阙误) cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, which includes the character *zui* (罪, "guilt") after *xiang* (相).

Great music does not enter the ears of village alleys. When "Broken Poplar" and "August Blossoms" are played, the crowd breaks into uproarious laughter. Thus, lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the multitude; the supreme discourse remains unspoken, for vulgar speech prevails. To be misled by two clay jars and bells is to lose one’s way. Now, with all under heaven deluded, though I have that which I aspire to, how can it be attained? Knowing it cannot be attained yet forcing the matter is yet another delusion. Thus, it is better to release it and not pursue. If one does not pursue, who shares the sorrow?

A man from Li in the dead of night fathers a child. He hastily seizes a torch to examine it, anxious lest it resemble himself.

**[1] [Annotation]**
It is not what the back alleys esteem.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Da sheng* (大声): Sima [Biao] says: This refers to the music of *Xian Chi* and *Liu Ying*.

**[2] [Annotation]**
When vulgar people hear a coarse tune, they laugh in unison.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Da sheng* refers to the grand music of *Xian Chi* and *Da Shao*, which is not heard in the back alleys. "Broken Poplar" and "August Blossoms" are likely rustic tunes of old, vulgar and base, provoking uproarious laughter. Formerly, Marquis Wen of Wei, upon hearing ancient music, grew drowsy and slept, but when he heard the new sounds of Zheng and Wei, he rejoiced—this is the same principle.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Zhe yang* (折杨): *zhe* as in *zhi lie* (之列).
*Huang fu* (皇荂): *fu* as in *kuang yu* (况于), or *fu yu* (抚于) in alternate pronunciation.

The original also writes *hua* as 華, pronounced like "flower." Sima's edition writes 里華. *Keran* (嗑然): *ke* as in *xu jia* (许甲). Li [Yun] says: *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are both ancient songs. *Ke* means the sound of laughter. The original also writes 嗌, pronounced *wu miao* (乌邈). Sima's edition writes 榼. *Zequ* (啧曲): *ze* as in *shi ze* (仕责). The original also writes 嗑.

**[3] [Annotation]**
Not to harbor it in the mind.

**[Subcommentary]**
Discourse of the utmost subtlety transcends the vulgar, hence it is called "lofty speech." How could it be confined to the minds of the multitude, when it is fitting to reside in the spiritual abode of the sages? Grand music does not enter the ears of back alleys; lofty speech naturally does not rest in the hearts of the crowd.

**[4] [Annotation]**
This is why the world has never employed the sage but always relies on itself.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Chu* (出) means to manifest. The words of the supreme Dao are bland and flavorless, not entering the ears of back alleys—how could they merely stop at the hearts of the multitude! Yet the words of the vulgar, adorned with ornate and false phrases, are like the tunes of *Broken Poplar*, pleasing to many listeners. Common sayings prevail along the thoroughfares, while the supreme words remain hidden and obscure. Thus, the *Qi Wu Lun* states: "Words are concealed in luxuriance."

**[5] [Annotation]**
Each clings to their own beliefs, hence they know not where to go.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Zhong* (踵) means the foot. Those who lose their way point north as south, and once the two delusions arise, their feet hang suspended, unable to advance. Even if one person alone wished to proceed, how could they reach their destination? This further explains the previous confusion.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Yi er fou zhong* (以二缶锺): *fou* should be written as *chui* (垂), and *zhong* as *zhong* (踵), meaning to let the feet dangle in midair, thus making it impossible to reach any destination. Sima's edition writes *er chui zhong* (二垂锺), explaining *zhong* as "attention." *Suo shi* (所适): Sima says: "to reach."

◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Pronunciation Notes* state *fou* should be written as *chui*, and *zhong* as *zhong*, meaning to let the feet dangle in midair, making it impossible to reach any destination. Sima's edition writes *er chui zhong*. Now, according to the *Shuowen*: *fou* is a pottery vessel used to hold wine or broth. *Zhong* is a wine vessel. The *Xiao Erya* states: "A *fu* and two and a half make a *sou*; a *sou* and two and a half make a *fou*; two *fou* make a *zhong*." Both *fou* and *zhong* are measuring vessels: a *fou* holds four *hu*, and a *zhong* holds eight *hu*. "To be deluded by two *fou* and *zhong*" means being unable to distinguish the differing capacities of the two vessels. Using them as measures, one becomes utterly lost, with no direction to follow. The previous text speaks of "one person deluded, two people deluded," referring to people; here, "deluded by two *fou* and *zhong*," refers to things. If everyone is deluded, who can enlighten them? To be deluded while holding measuring vessels is insufficient to determine quantities. When the entire world is vast and all are deluded, who can point the way? This presents two interpretations.

◎ Yu Yue says: The meaning of "two *fou* and *zhong*" is unclear. The *Pronunciation Notes* state *fou* should be written as *chui*, and *zhong* as *zhong*, meaning to let the feet dangle in midair, making it impossible to reach any destination. This does not align with Zhuangzi's intent. *Suo shi* means "where to go." Guo's annotation—"Each clings to their own beliefs, hence they know not where to go"—is correct. If following Lu's explanation, *shi* would mean "contentment," and it should say "cannot attain contentment," not "cannot reach *suo shi*." Now, *zhong* should be written as *zhong* (踵), and *er* (二) is a corruption of a single character, while *fou* (缶) is a corruption of *qi* (企). Beneath *qi* is *zhi* (止), and the vulgar form of *fou* (□) also has *zhi* (止) beneath it; the two shapes resemble each other, leading to the error. The *Wen Xuan*’s *Tan Shi Fu* commentary cites the *Zi Lin*: "*Qi* means to stand on tiptoe." The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* (15) cites the *Tong Su Wen*: "To stand on tiptoe is called *qi*." Thus, *qi zhong* means to stand on tiptoe. If one stands on tiptoe in confusion, they cannot reach their destination. Hence, below it says: "Now, with the whole world deluded, though I have a direction, how can I attain it?" "With the whole world deluded" emphasizes the vastness of the land; "deluded by standing on tiptoe" emphasizes its smallness. The previous text says: "If two are deluded, they toil without reaching, for the deluded prevail." Now, with the whole world deluded, though I have a direction, it cannot be attained. The whole world contrasts with two people, referring to the number of people; here, the whole world contrasts with standing on tiptoe, referring to the expanse of land. If *yi qi zhong* (一企踵) is corrupted into *er fou zhong* (二缶锺), the meaning is lost.

**[6] [Subcommentary]**
If two people let their feet dangle, reaching their destination is already difficult—how much more so when the whole world is lost! Thus, though one may have the heart to seek direction, its use is certainly unattainable. This explains the previous "Is it not also sorrowful?" The lament is profound, hence the emphasis.

**[7] [Annotation]**
Follow and align with them.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Shi* (释) means to release. When delusion runs deep, it is difficult to resolve in haste. Yet those who forcefully seek correctness are merely another kind of foolishness. Better to release and not pursue, so that self and others may find peace.

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Er qiang* (而强): *qiang* as in *qi zhang* (其丈). The same applies in the annotation below.

**[8] [Annotation]**
Pursue (abandon) to attain what is fitting in the moment, without forcibly urging resolution—thus together they may pass an age without sorrow.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Bi* means "with." If one allows things to resolve their delusions, discarding them without insistence, then both self and other may roam freely—with whom would there be worry or suffering?

**[Pronunciation Notes]**
*Bi you* (比忧): *bi* as in *pi zhi* (毗志反). Sima’s version reads *bi* (鼻), glossed as "beginning."
*Qu ling* (趣令): *ling* as in *li cheng* (力呈反). The same applies below.
*Ling jie* (令解): *jie* as in *xie* (蟹).

**[9] [Annotation]**
*Li* means "evil person." When the world does not wish to do evil, yet does so, it is either compelled by harsh servitude or deluded and estranged from their nature. However, the deluded reflect and return, while the evil contemplate goodness—thus, if I practice non-action, the world transforms of itself.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Li* refers to the ugly and afflicted. *Ju* means "swift," and *ji ji* describes haste. It speaks of an ugly person who gives birth at midnight, swiftly fetching a light to examine the child, their heart anxious and hurried, fearing it may resemble them. Yet even one so vile and hideous still hopes to cast off ugliness and follow beauty—how much more should the foolish and deluded weary of their confusion and seek awakening! If one releases them without insistence, naturally there will be no sorrow or suffering.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Lì* is pronounced *lài*, or may be read as written. ◎ My late father remarks: The case of an afflicted person giving birth at night offers another interpretation to complete the preceding meaning. One who conforms to the vulgar delights in the vulgar conforming to oneself, unaware of its wrongness. The afflicted, fearing their child may resemble them, do not seek such conformity—thus they alone recognize their affliction. Yet their conformity to the vulgar differs not from forcing oneself to conform to affliction; they remain oblivious to its wrongness, knowing nothing else. *Jù* is pronounced *jù* (giant *jù* reflex). Some versions write it as *qú*, with the same pronunciation. *Jíjí* is pronounced *jí* (urgent). *Kē yì* is pronounced *hé* (river). **[Collation]** (1) The character *shě* follows the Zhao Jianyi edition.

A century-old tree, hewn into a sacrificial *xī*-vessel, adorned with azure and yellow patterns—its offcut lies discarded in a ditch. Comparing the *xī*-vessel to the offcut in the ditch, beauty and ugliness differ, yet their loss of nature is one and the same. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi differ in conduct, yet their loss of nature is equal.

Moreover, there are five ways to lose one’s nature:
1. The five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear;
2. The five sounds confuse the ears, rendering them dull;
3. The five odors choke the nose, congesting the bridge;
4. The five flavors cloy the mouth, leaving it numb and impaired;
5. Preferences and aversions agitate the mind, scattering one’s nature.

These five are all harms to life. Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, striving apart, claim to have attained the Way—this is not what I call attainment. If entrapment can be called attainment, then the turtledove in a cage may also be said to have attained it. Further, when preferences, aversions, sounds, and colors kindle the inner self, and when caps of skin, egret plumes, sashes, tablets, and long ribbons constrain the outer, the inner is propped up by a lattice of restraint, the outer bound by cords and snares. Though one gazes dazedly from within the snares, believing oneself to have attained the Way, this is no different from a prisoner with bound arms and manacled fingers—if even tigers and leopards in cages can be said to have attained it.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Xī* refers to carving the shape of a sacrificial ox into a vessel, called a *xī*-vessel. *Jiàn* means "distinction." Once hewn into an ox and adorned with azure and yellow patterns, one offcut is cast into a ditch, unused. Comparing the two, beauty and ugliness differ, yet the loss of the wood’s nature is the same. This serves as an analogy.

**[Exegetical Notes]**
*Xī* is pronounced *xī*, or *sù hé* reflex. ◎ Qingfan notes: The *Mao Commentary* states that the *xī*-vessel is adorned with sand-like patterns. (See the *Bì Gōng* chapter of the *Book of Songs*.) Zheng Sinong says: The *xī*-vessel is inlaid with kingfisher feathers. (See the *Zhou Rituals* commentary on the *Sī Zūn Yí*.) Later Zheng says: *Xī* is read like *shā* (sand); the vessel is carved with phoenix motifs, their feathers rendered in a fluttering style. (See the *Míng Táng Wèi* commentary in the *Rituals*.) Wang Niansun cites Gao You’s commentary on the *Chù Zhēn* chapter of the *Huainanzi*: "The *xī*-vessel is like an openwork vessel." Thus, the *xī*-vessel is carved and painted with myriad forms, the most ornate of the six ritual vessels. Hence, the ancients cited it to illustrate lavish adornment. Some say it is adorned with sand-like patterns, others with kingfisher feathers, still others with phoenix motifs, or openwork carvings—though the accounts differ, they agree on its intricacy. However, Ruan Shen’s *Illustrated Rituals* claims the *xī*-vessel is adorned with an ox, deriving this from the character *xī* (牺) containing *niú* (牛)—a case of interpreting the script without basis. *Qí duàn* is pronounced *tú luàn* reflex; the same below.

The base text may alternatively read "reason." (2) **Subcommentary:** This is a combined analogy. The wanton cruelty of Jie and Zhi, and the practice of benevolence and righteousness by Zeng and Shi—though their traces of good and evil differ, their loss of the true is in fact the same. (3) **Subcommentary:** Deluded passions and lost nature arise in many ways, but to summarize, there are five. (4) **Subcommentary:** The five colors—blue-green, yellow, red, white, and black—confound the vulgar with greed, disturbing the eyes so that principle cannot be seen; hence, they are called "not bright." (5) **Subcommentary:** The five tones are *gong*, *shang*, *jue*, *zhi*, and *yu*. Indulgence in vulgar sounds obstructs the hearing of the Dao; hence, they are called "not keen." (6) **Subcommentary:** The five odors are rank, scorched, fragrant, fishy, and rotten. *Zōng* means blockage, referring to obstruction and injury. The nose, affected by the five odors, becomes congested and blocked, harming the bridge of the nose. External texts refer to fragrance as "odor." Thus, the *Yijing* states, "Its odor is like orchid"; the *Daoist Canon* speaks of the five fragrances, and the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says

(7) **Subcommentary:** The five flavors are sour, pungent, sweet, bitter, and salty. *Lì* means illness; *shuǎng* means loss. Indulgence in the five flavors defiles and muddies the mouth’s root, causing saltiness and bitterness to become chronic ailments, so that the tongue loses its sense of taste; hence, they are called "illness and loss."

**Philological Notes:** *Zhuó kǒu* (浊口) is also written as *zhòu* (噣), with the same pronunciation. ◎Qing scholar Jiao Xun’s note: The *Mao Commentary* on the *Odes* ("Si Qi") states, "*Lì* means illness." The *Lost Books of Zhou* ("Laws of Posthumous Titles") says, "*Shuǎng* means injury" (the *Guangya* concurs). "Causing the mouth *lì shuǎng*" refers to illness and injury to the sense of taste (see the *Huainanzi*, "Spirit and Essence"; Gao You’s commentary writes *shuǎng shāng*; the *Wenzi*, "Nine Safeguards," writes "causing the mouth to grow sores"—all later alterations by reckless hands).

(8) **Subcommentary:** *Qù* means to take; *huá* means disorder. Following the heart, one takes; opposing the emotions, one abandons. This disturbs and disorders the heart, causing the natural nature to race without cease, becoming frivolous, restless, and agitated; hence, it is called "flying and scattering."

**Philological Notes:** *Huá xīn* (滑心): Li [Yi] reads it as *gǔ*. It is also written as *zhòu* (噣).

(9) **Subcommentary:** In summary, the five matters discussed above are all blades that sever fate and axes that harm life—grievous harms to the people.

(10) **Subcommentary:** *Lí qì* describes the appearance of exertion. Yang Zhu and Mo Di each flaunted their own abilities, losing their nature and harming life, taking this as attainment. Since they deviated from the principle of naturalness, they were not what Master Zhuang could acknowledge.

**Philological Notes:** *Lí*: read as *lì zhì* (also *fǎn*). *Qì*: read as *qiū chǐ fǎn*.

(11) **Subcommentary:** Those whose hearts are constrained by benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and law do not act from their true nature. Having falsified their nature, they encounter hardship and suffering. If one takes such hardship as attainment, how is this different from the turtledove or owl in a cage, calling itself content?

(12) **Subcommentary:** *Pí biàn* refers to a cap made of leather. The *yù* is a bird, resembling a duck, dark blue in color, found in Yulin. Its iridescent feathers adorn caps, hence the name "yù cap." This bird’s cap is worn by those who know celestial patterns. *Jìn* means to insert; *hù* is like a *guī* (jade tablet), referring to the insertion of the tablet. *Shēn* is the sash; *xiū* is the long skirt. These all serve to adorn court attire. The frivolous and false, making gain and loss their trade, have their inner treasuries choked with sensory dusts—sounds, colors, and the like—while their outer forms are bound by caps, tablets, and sashes. Turning their backs on the Dao of non-action and deviating from natural nature, they take this as attainment—how is this different from the turtledove or owl?

**Philological Notes:** *Yù*: read as *yǐn bì fǎn*; Xu reads *shù*. Also written as *shù*, same pronunciation, a bird’s name. Also called *cuì*, resembling a swallow, dark blue, found in Yulin; its feathers adorn caps.
◎ Qingfan’s note: The *Shuowen* says: "The *yù* is a bird that knows when rain is coming." The *yù* is the kingfisher. The *Liji* states: "Those who know celestial patterns wear the *yù* cap." The *Yupian*, *Erya*, *Shiwen*, and *Hanshu Wuxing Zhi* all give the readings *yù* and *shù* for *yù*. The *Kuangmiu Zhengsu* says: "The *yù* is a water bird that cries when rain is coming. The ancients, knowing it understood celestial timing, made caps in its image for those who oversaw celestial patterns to wear. *Yù* is read as *yù*, though it also has the sound *shù*, hence the *Yifu Tu* and Cai Yong’s *Duduan* call it the *shù*-clan cap—merely a shift in pronunciation from *yù* to *shù*." This *Shiwen* also writes *yù* as *shù*. The *Hanshu Yufu Zhi* quotes the *Ji* as saying, "Those who know the heavens wear the *shù* cap." The *Shuoyuan Xiuwen* writes it as *guàn shù*, likely because *yù* has the sound *shù*, hence it is sometimes written as *shù*, *shù*, or *shù*.
*Hù*: read as *hū*. *Shēn*: read as *shēn*, the sash.

(13) **Subcommentary:** *Zhī* means obstruction; *yíng*, fullness. *Zhà* is a cage; *mò zhuó*, ropes. *Huǎn huǎn* describes the act of seeing. With gain and loss obstructing and filling the inner treasury, it is like piling firewood into a pen. With sashes and tablets binding the outer form, it is like being caught in snares. Externally and internally so constrained and exhausted, yet taking this as attainment—how is this different from a criminal with arms crossed and fingers bound, tied with ropes? Or like a tiger or leopard trapped in a pit, confined in a cage, distressed and suffering beyond measure, yet calling itself content—how is this different?

**Philological Notes:** *Chái zhà*: read as *chǔ gé fǎn*; Guo reads *cè*. *Wài zhòng*: read as *zhí lóng fǎn*. *Mò*: read as *mò*; *zhuó*: read as *zhuó*; Guo reads *gǔ diào fǎn*. *Huǎn huǎn*: read as *huán bǎn fǎn*, or *hù guān fǎn*. Li [Yi] says: "The appearance of strained vision." Another says: "The appearance of squinting."
*Jiāo bì lì zhǐ*: Sima [Biao] says: "*Jiāo bì* means reverse binding; *lì zhǐ* is like *lì lóu* [straining to see]." *Jiàn*: read as *hù lǎn fǎn*.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The character *yě* follows the *Mao Zhuan* original.

**Outer Chapters, "The Dao of Heaven" XIII**

(1) **Philological Notes:** The chapter is named for its theme.

The Dao of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus all things are completed. The Dao of the Thearch operates without accumulation, thus the world submits. The Dao of the Sage operates without accumulation, thus all within the seas obeys. Those who are enlightened by Heaven and penetrating of the Sage, whose six senses and four limbs are open to the virtue of Thearchs and Kings—their self-cultivation is obscurely and utterly still.

The stillness of the Sage is not because stillness is good, and thus still; rather, nothing in the myriad things can disturb the heart, and thus it is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects beard and brows, levels to the plumb line, and the great craftsman takes it as a model. If still water is so clear, how much more the spirit! The heart of the Sage is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking glass of the myriad things.

That emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action are the level of Heaven and Earth and the utmost of the Dao and virtue—thus Thearchs, Kings, and Sages rest therein. Resting, they are empty; empty, they are full—fullness is fulfillment. Empty, they are still; still, they move; moving, they attain. Still, they are non-active; being non-active, those who act are responsible. Non-active, they are at ease; being at ease, cares and troubles cannot abide, and lifespan is long. Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action are the root of the myriad things.

Turning southward with this understanding, Yao became a true lord.

Grasping this and turning northward, Shun became a true minister.

Abiding in this at the highest, it is the virtue of Thearchs, Kings, and Celestial Sons; abiding in this at the lowest, it is the Dao of Dark Sages and Uncrowned Kings. With this, retiring to dwell in leisure and roaming rivers and seas, recluses of mountains and forests submit; with this, advancing to govern and soothe the world, then merit is great, fame is illustrious, and all under Heaven is unified.

Still, one is sagely; moving, one is kingly. Non-active, one is revered. Unadorned and plain, none under Heaven can rival their beauty.

He who clearly understands the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the Great Root and Great Origin, the one who harmonizes with Heaven. This is how one harmonizes and regulates all under Heaven, the one who harmonizes with others.

Harmonizing with others is called human joy; harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.

**[5]** **Commentary:** When one deems stillness as good, there will come a time for movement.
**Exegesis:** The reason the sage remains empty and still is simply that their form is like withered wood, their mind like dead ashes—yet they do not know stillness *as* stillness. If one regards stillness as something fine and cherishes the intent to be still, then there will indeed come a time for movement.

**[6]** **Commentary:** This is true self-attainment.
**Exegesis:** The wondrous essence of the Two Modes is non-being; all myriad realms are empty. Thus, though they partake in change and merge with the dust, there is no clamor or disturbance—not because they cultivate restraint to achieve stillness.
**Philological Notes:** *Nao xin* (鐃心): *nào xiào* (nào xiào), also *nǚ jiāo* (nǚ jiāo), or *ér xiǎo* (ér xiǎo).

**[7]** **Exegesis:** Water, when stirred, flows in waves; when stilled, it becomes clear and tranquil. Suspended as a mirror, it illuminates without partiality, thus able to reveal the finest details of brows and beard. Pure and upright, it corrects all crookedness and serves as a standard. Even the skill of Gongshu must imitate water to find levelness. Hence the *Laozi* says: *"The highest virtue is like water."* This is the meaning of the analogy.
**Philological Notes:** *Zhun zhong* (中準): *dīng zhòng* (dīng zhòng). ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The modern text reads *zhǔn* (準).
*Da jiang* (大匠): Some say this refers to the Son of Heaven.

**[8]** **Commentary:** When one possesses the means yet allows things to act of themselves, what is illuminated is never obscure.
**Exegesis:** The sage’s virtue aligns with the Two Modes, their wisdom encompasses the ten thousand things—how could they be compared to the insentient water? If still water can yet clearly reflect brows and beard, how much more so the mind of a spirit-like sage! Thus, to mirror the subtleties of Heaven and Earth and reflect the profound mysteries of the myriad things is only fitting. This is the synthesis of the analogy.

**[9] Commentary:** All that is uneven or incomplete arises from deliberate action.

**Exegesis:** Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and quiescence—though these four bear different names, they share the same reality. In praising the beauty of non-action, these four terms are thus employed. Heaven and Earth attain equilibrium through them, and the Dao and virtue reach perfection by means of them.

**Philological Notes:** *Dàn* (淡): *tú zhàn* (徒暂反). ◎ Qing Fan notes: *Zhì* (至) is equivalent to *zhì* (质). *Zhì* means "substance." In the *Lǐ* (*Rites*), *Zá Jì* (*Miscellaneous Records*) reads: "Send so-and-so to fulfill [the duty]," where Zheng's commentary states: "*Shí* (实) should be *zhì* (至)." In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Su Qin's Biography* reads: "Zhao reached an agreement with Wei," where the *Suǒyǐn* commentary states: "*Zhì* (至) should be *zhì* (质)." In the *Book of Han*, *Biography of Dongfang Shuo* reads: "Not the most substantial," where Yan Shigu's commentary states: "*Zhì* (至) means *shí* (实)." The *Kè Yì* (*Carving Intent*) chapter originally writes: "the substance of the Dao and virtue."

**[10] Commentary:** It has never stirred.

**Exegesis:** By stilling thought, equilibrium and perfection are attained.

**[11] Commentary:** *Lún* (伦) means "principle."

**Exegesis:** Having stilled thought and quieted the mind, one merges in virtue with the emptiness of space. Merging with the emptiness of space, one unites with the true and real Dao. The true and real Dao is the principle of spontaneity.

**[12] Commentary:** It does not lose that by which it moves.

**Exegesis:** When principle is empty and still, stillness can yet give rise to movement—this is the attainment.

**[13] Commentary:** In non-action, the myriad talents and all things each perform their tasks and fulfill their duties. Thus it is said: "How majestic were Shun and Yu in possessing the world yet not engaging with it!"—this is what is meant.

**Exegesis:** To undertake affairs is the role of ministers; this refers to the duties and responsibilities of subordinates. When the emperor and king employ wisdom yet remain tranquil in non-action, their ministers each attend to their offices and bear their burdens. Thus, the sovereign practices non-action while ministers handle affairs, and so the imperial crown hangs before the eyes yet does not interfere.

**Philological Notes:** *Wēiwēi* (巍巍): *yú guī* (鱼归反). *Bù yǔ* (不与): *yù* (预).

**[14] Commentary:** *Yúyúrán* (俞俞然) describes a demeanor of ease and self-possession.

**Exegesis:** *Yúyú* describes a demeanor of ease, harmony, and joy. Deliberate action clings to circumstances, and worldly entanglements disturb the mind. Non-action brings self-possession, and worries and troubles cannot enter one’s thoughts. At ease and harmonious, one’s years and lifespan are thus prolonged.

**Philological Notes:** *Yúyú* (俞俞): *yáng zhū* (羊朱反). The *Guǎng Yǎ* states: "It means joy." Also pronounced *yù* (喻). *Cóngróng* (从容): *qī róng* (七容反).

**[15] Commentary:** Tracing their roots, all emerge from non-action.

**Exegesis:** These four lines encompass the root-source of the myriad things. Thus, the earlier words are reiterated to conclude their meaning.

**[16] Exegesis:** The beauty of yielding and deference finds no surpassing in the era of Tang and Yu; the flourishing of lord and minister reaches no prior heights before Yao and Shun. Therefore, these two sovereigns are cited to illustrate the four virtues. Though one faces south and the other north, their attainment is equal in its perfection.

**Philological Notes:** *Nánxiàng* (南乡): *xǔ liàng* (许亮反). Also written as *xiàng* (向).

**[17] Commentary:** These are the ultimate expressions of non-action. One who possesses the Dao and is embraced by the world yet lacks its titles—this is what is meant by the unadorned king valuing himself.

**Exegesis:** Employing this non-action to dwell above all things is the virtue of the Son of Heaven, Emperor Yao. Embracing this emptiness and tranquility while abiding below as a minister is the Dao of the dark sage and unadorned king. One who possesses the Dao yet lacks its titles—this is what is meant by the dark sage and unadorned king valuing himself, as with the Old Master and the Master of Lu.

**Philological Notes:** *Sùwáng* (素王): *wǎng kuàng* (往况反). As in the commentary.

**[18] Exegesis:** To "retire and dwell" means to conceal one's traces and live in seclusion. Employing this Dao in retreat, one may wander and delight in mountains and rivers, at ease and carefree in leisure. Thus, all recluses under heaven submit to such a one—this is the way of those like Xu You and Chao Fu.

**Philological Notes:** *Ér xián* (而闲): pronounced *xián*.

**[19] Commentary:** This is yet another, lesser expression. Thus, in retreat, one becomes like Xu You and Chao Fu; in advancement, like Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou. The scope of non-action is vast—what under heaven could not be achieved through it? If the sovereign does not assume the duties of the chief minister, then Yi and Lü remain tranquil in their offices; if the chief minister does not impose his will upon the hundred officials, then the hundred officials remain tranquil in their governance; if the hundred officials do not burden the myriad people with tasks, then the myriad people remain tranquil and secure in their livelihoods; if the myriad people do not alter their innate abilities, then all under heaven remain tranquil and content in their stations. From the Son of Heaven down to the common folk, even extending to insects and crawling things—who could achieve anything through action? Thus, the more one embodies non-action, the more exalted one becomes.

**Exegesis:** To "advance and serve" means to reveal one's traces and take office. One who embodies the wondrous essence of non-action and descends to mingle with the world may govern the people with benevolence and longevity, magnify perfect virtue in a sagely court, manifest unfathomable merit, and display the political achievements of a chief minister. Thus, all under heaven is united, chariots and writing share a single standard, and all is perfectly good and beautiful—could this not be the way of those like Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou?

**[20] Commentary:** Move when the time is right; halt when the time is right.

**[21] Commentary:** Naturally revered by all things.

**Exegesis:** In stillness, it is the exaltation of the dark sage and unadorned king; in motion, the nobility of the Nine-Five sovereign. Through non-action, one is exalted—emerging as the Son of Heaven, dwelling as the unadorned king. Wherever the Dao resides, who would dare not hold it in esteem?

**[22] Commentary:** Only simplicity and plainness can match heaven.

**Exegesis:** Unadorned simplicity, non-action, and emptiness—these are the root of the myriad things. Thus, what could rival their exalted beauty?

**[23] Commentary:** Heaven and earth take non-action as their virtue. Thus, clarifying their fundamental origin aligns one with heaven and earth without opposition.

**Exegesis:** When the numinous abode is bright and tranquil, the spirit illumines purity, and virtue harmonizes with the two forces, one may surely serve as the master craftsman of the people, the root of all existence, mysteriously uniting with the Dao of nature and attuning to heaven.

**[24] Commentary:** To follow heaven is to respond to humanity. Thus, when harmony with heaven is complete, harmony with humanity is perfected.

**Exegesis:** *Jūn* means "level"; *tiáo* means "accord." Without intention, response is like echo and shadow. Leveling and according with the myriad things, one fully accords with their nature, mingling traces with the dust—thus harmonizing with humanity.

**[25] Commentary:** When the joy of heaven is fulfilled, the joy of humanity is complete.

**Exegesis:** Lowering oneself to the dust of the world, one delights in the joys of the human realm; raising one's gaze to the natural, one rejoices in the joy of the heavenly Dao.

**Philological Notes:**

Zhuangzi said: "My master! My master!"

The myriad things are transformed yet not perverse,
Their blessings extend through ten thousand generations yet not called benevolent,
They endure since high antiquity yet not called long-lived,
They cover and bear heaven and earth, carve and adorn all forms yet not called skillful—
This is called the joy of Heaven.

Thus it is said: "One who knows the joy of Heaven,
In life follows the movement of Heaven, in death transforms with things.
At rest shares the power of yin, in motion moves with the wave of yang."

Therefore, one who knows the joy of Heaven
Harbors no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no burden from things, no reproach from spirits.

Thus it is said: "In movement, they are of Heaven; in stillness, they are of Earth.
With a single mind settled, they rule all under Heaven.
Their spirits bring no harm, their souls know no weariness—
With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit."

This speaks of extending emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—
This is called the joy of Heaven.
The joy of Heaven is the heart of the sage, by which they nurture all under Heaven.

**Note:**
(1) *Wéi lì* (为戾): "to be perverse"; here, the commentary explains: "transforming and intermingling, thus it is said."

The Dao of nature is no cruel tyrant to my teacher.
**Commentary:** "Crushing" means to break apart; "tyrant" means violent. Zhuangzi takes the supreme Dao of nature as his teacher, and by repeating this, he extols its virtue. What I take as my teacher is the great Dao, which nurtures all living beings. Even if it were to govern the myriad things, it would harbor no violent intent—thus, when autumn strips the leaves and they wither, they bear no resentment. This makes clear that even when cutting or shaping, it is not done out of malice.

**Annotation:**
*《子》* zǐ: read with the falling tone.
*《为戾》* wéi lì: read as *lìjì*, meaning "violent."

**Note:**
"Benevolence" is merely a term for partial love; without love, there is nothing to call benevolence.

**Commentary:**
"Benevolence" is the trace of partial affection. The great Dao opens and closes Heaven and Earth, creating and transforming all living things. Its boundless kindness is impartial, and so it is not called benevolent.

**Note:**
"Longevity" merely denotes a distant term; without a fixed term, there is nothing to call longevity.

**Commentary:**
How could it merely be longer than high antiquity? It even precedes the Lord of Heaven. Since it is neither born nor destroyed, how could it be subject to early death or long life? As Guo’s commentary says, "Longevity merely denotes a distant term."

**Annotation:**
*《长于》* cháng yú: read as *zhǎng yú*. The same applies at the end of the chapter.

**4. Commentary:**
"Skill" merely denotes what is wondrously made; all things are so of themselves, and thus there is nothing to call skill.

**Subcommentary:**
Riding the Two Modes to cover and bear all, taking the myriad things to carve and sculpt—yet the Two Modes regard generation and transformation as their skill, while the myriad things take spontaneity as their function. Since generation and transformation do not rely on external things, how could carving and sculpting depend on others? Thus, when each thing employs its capacity and all people follow their nature, the names of craft and clumsiness vanish. As Guo’s commentary says, "Skill merely denotes what is wondrously made."

**5. Commentary:**
Forgetting joy, joy is complete.

**Subcommentary:**
Wherever one dwells in ease, it coalesces into Heavenly joy.

**Annotation:**
*《天乐》* tiān lè: read as *tiān yuè*. The same applies throughout the chapter.

**6. Subcommentary:**
Once one knows that Heavenly joy is not sorrow or joy, one knows that life and death are without life and death. Thus, in life, one is one with the Dao of Heaven’s four seasons; in death, one merges with the transformations of the myriad things.

**7. Subcommentary:**
The wondrous root is emptily congealed; approaching utmost yin, it equalizes its stillness and quiescence. Its responsive traces align with the world, joining the great yang in its flowing waves.

**8. Subcommentary:**
Virtue harmonizes with Heaven, so Heaven bears no resentment; conduct accords with the world, so people raise no objections. I am obscure to things, so things do not burden me; I do not betray the hidden or the manifest, so what reproach could ghosts bring?

**9. Commentary:**
Though movement and stillness differ, the absence of intent unifies them.

**Subcommentary:**
"Heaven and Earth" illustrates the meaning of movement and stillness without intent.

**10. Commentary:**
Ever without intent, thus ruling all under Heaven without weariness or affliction.

**Subcommentary:**
When realm and wisdom merge in obscurity, it is called "oneness." When things cannot disturb it, it is called "stability." Only by stabilizing the one mind can one rule the myriad states. Since no ghost brings reproach, what misfortune or curse could arise? Moving yet ever still, thus the spirit does not weary.

**Annotation:**
*《而王》* ér wàng: read as *ér wáng*. The same applies to the commentary and below.

《祟》*suì*: read as *suì* (swift), or in Xu’s reading, *xīlèi* (like *xī*). Li [Yi] says: "misfortune."

**11. Subcommentary:**
One whose mind is congealed resembles dead ashes, yet stillness rules over restlessness—thus the myriad things submit in obedience.

**12. Commentary:**
When my mind remains ever still, the minds of the myriad things become open. Open, they submit; closed, they rebel.

**Subcommentary:**
The reason the myriad things submit when the one mind is stabilized lies solely in employing the wisdom of emptiness and stillness. By tracing the principles of the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) and penetrating the conditions of the myriad things, one transforms in accord with them without ever failing to be fitting—this is called the "Heavenly Joy."

**13. Commentary:**
What does the sage’s mind employ to nurture all under Heaven? Nothing but the Heavenly Joy.

**Subcommentary:**
The sage’s descent to tread the same path as the common and partake in the supreme joy of Heaven and Earth is precisely to nurture and sustain the black-haired people and bring harmony to the multitudes.

**Annotation:**
《畜天》*xù tiān*: read as *xù tiān* (sixth tone). The same applies to the commentary.

The virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant principle. In non-action, one employs all under Heaven with ease; in action, one is employed by all under Heaven and finds it insufficient. Thus the ancients prized non-action. When the ruler practices non-action, the subjects also practice non-action—this means the subjects share the same virtue as the ruler, and when they share the same virtue, they do not serve as ministers. When the subjects act, the ruler also acts—this means the ruler shares the same path as the subjects, and when they share the same path, there is no true lord. The ruler must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven, while the subjects must act to be employed by all under Heaven—this is the unchanging Dao.

Thus the ancient kings of all under Heaven, though their wisdom encompassed Heaven and Earth, did not deliberate on their own; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not speak on their own; though their abilities exhausted all within the seas, they did not act on their own. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success. Thus it is said: nothing is more divine than Heaven, nothing is richer than Earth, nothing is greater than emperors and kings. Thus it is said: the virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is the Dao of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the multitudes.

**1. Subcommentary:**
The kings take Heaven and Earth as their root, thus they cover and bear without intent; they master the Dao and virtue, thus they give life without possession. Though they undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they remain constantly in non-action. Such was the abundant virtue of Yao as a ruler.

**2. Annotation:**
"With ease" refers to leisure.

**3. Annotation:**
"Insufficient" means being hurriedly employed by things. When one desires to be employed by things, one can be made a minister, and when one becomes a minister, one also has ease.

**Subcommentary:**
"Insufficient" is an expression of haste. "With ease" refers to leisure. It means that when the ruler above practices non-action, his wisdom illuminates with breadth and openness, governing the realm with leisure to spare. When the subjects below act, their concerns are narrow and inferior, each attending to their duties, employed by the ruler, diligent in their offices, yet still fearing insufficiency. Thus it is known that non-action and action follow separate paths of labor and rest.

**4. Annotation:**
A craftsman practices non-action in carving wood but acts in using the axe; the ruler practices non-action in attending to affairs but acts in employing ministers. Ministers attend to affairs, while the ruler employs ministers; the axe carves wood, while the craftsman uses the axe. Each fulfills its capacity, and the principle of Heaven arises naturally—this is not action. If the ruler takes over the affairs of ministers, he is no longer a ruler; if ministers grasp the ruler’s authority, they are no longer ministers. Thus when each attends to its duty, the principle of non-action in both superior and inferior is perfectly realized.

**Subcommentary:**
Non-action is the virtue of the ruler; action is the path of the minister. If both superior and inferior practice non-action, the ministers usurp the ruler’s virtue; if both practice action, the ruler encroaches on the minister’s path. When the ruler encroaches on the minister’s path, he is no longer a lord; when ministers usurp the ruler’s virtue, how can they be called ministers? Thus when superior and inferior are confused, ruler and minister are disordered, deviating from nature and inevitably inviting danger and disaster. Therefore, the words on non-action must be carefully examined. Non-action belongs to the ruler. The ancients prized non-action. Guo’s annotation of this passage is most eloquent and reasonable.

**5. Annotation:**
The words on non-action must be carefully examined. Employing all under Heaven also involves a kind of action. Yet when one attains this action, one moves in accord with one’s nature, thus it is called non-action. Now, those who are employed by all under Heaven also attain this. But those below attend to affairs, so even when Yao and Yu served as ministers, they were still called acting. Thus in relation to superior and inferior, the ruler is still while the minister is active; in comparison to ancient and modern times, Yao and Shun practiced non-action while Tang and Wu had affairs. Yet each follows its nature, and the mysterious mechanism of Heaven operates—then in ancient and modern times, in superior and inferior, who truly acts?

**Subcommentary:**
When one occupies the position of ruler above, one must practice non-action and entrust matters to things, employing the talents of all under Heaven. When one serves as a minister below, one must attend to affairs and act, fulfilling the duties of one’s office. Then all under Heaven is transformed. This is the unchanging Dao of the hundred kings.

**6. Subcommentary:**
This refers to the ancient rulers of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Their wisdom was bright and penetrating, encompassing the Two Modes, yet they sat with folded arms in non-action, entrusting matters to their ministers. The wise devised plans, so they did not deliberate on their own.

**Annotation:**
"*Zhi sui*" (知虽) is pronounced as *zhi* (wisdom). The same applies to "foolish wisdom" below.

**7. Subcommentary:**
Their eloquence flowed like a river, adorning the myriad things, yet they entrusted all to their stewards, never speaking of it themselves.

**Annotation:**
"*Zi shuo*" (自说) is pronounced as *yue* (悦).

**8. Commentary:**
Those above err when they cannot practice non-action and instead usurp the duties of their ministers. If Gao Yao could not exercise his discerning judgment, if Hou Ji could not carry out his sowing and planting, then all talents would be deprived of their roles, and the ruler above would be burdened with labor. Thus, with regal crown and tassels veiling his gaze, he entrusts all under Heaven to others. When all under Heaven may act of their own accord, this is non-action that accomplishes everything—hence both above and below practice non-action. Yet the non-action of the ruler employs others, while the non-action of the ministers employs themselves.

**Subcommentary:**
When arts and talents surpass all within the seas, entrust them to worthy aides and take no part—what then is there to do? Only profound silence. Thus, the *Laozi* states: "This is called employing the strength of others."

**Annotation:**
"*Gao*" (咎) is pronounced as *gao* (羔). "*Yao*" (繇) is pronounced as *yao* (遥). "*Ming duan*" (明断) is read as *ding luan* (丁乱反).

**9. Commentary:**
This is what is meant by "of itself."

**Subcommentary:**
Heaven has no intent in generation, yet the myriad things are transformed and born. Earth has no mind in nurturing, yet the myriad things mature and grow. Thus, Guo’s commentary states: "This is called spontaneity."

**10. Commentary:**
Achievement is accomplished by others.

**Subcommentary:**
The king aligns with the nurturing of the Two Modes and follows the four seasons to bestow life, entrusting the myriad things to act of themselves—thus the achievements of all under Heaven are complete.

◎Wang Niansun notes: According to Guo’s explanation, a *cheng* (成) should be added after *gong* (功) to clarify its meaning. Yet *gong* itself means *cheng*—it speaks of non-action whereby all under Heaven is accomplished. (The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: "Accomplishes without acting.") The *Erya* says: "*Gong* means *cheng*." The *Sheng De* chapter of the *Da Dai Li Ji* states: "One who can perfect virtue and law is said to have *gong*." In the *Zhou Li*, the *Gao Ren* reports *gong* to the *Si Gong Shi* and *Shan Ren*, and Zheng’s commentary says: "*Gong* means *cheng*." The *Guanzi*’s *Wu Fu* chapter states: "Great officers are tasked with offices and discerning affairs; officials are tasked with duties and upholding their posts; scholars cultivate themselves and perfect their talents." (*Gong cai* means to perfect one’s talents.) The *Xunzi*’s *Fu Guo* chapter states: "The strength of the common people awaits it and then achieves *gong*." (It means awaiting it and then accomplishing.) "The myriad things are transformed, the myriad things mature, all under Heaven achieves *gong*"—these phrases stand in parallel, showing that *gong* means *cheng*.

**11. Subcommentary:**
The sun and moon alternate in brightness and obscurity; clouds, thunder, wind, and rain shade and cover unpredictably—thus nothing is more numinous than Heaven. It encompasses rivers and plains, contains mountains and streams, and bears all endlessly—thus nothing is richer than Earth. Occupying the position of nine-five, wielding the might of ten thousand chariots, illumined by sun and moon, uniting all under one—none surpasses the king in greatness of power and virtue. Thus, the *Laozi* states: "Within the realm, four are great, and the king is one of them."

**12. Commentary:**
This is to be one with the non-action of Heaven and Earth.

**Subcommentary:**
*Pei* means to unite. The virtue of the sage unites with the non-action of Heaven and Earth.

**13. Subcommentary:**
Comprehending the unpossessive nurturing of covering and bearing, he thus rides and governs the Two Modes. Following the ebb and flow of transformation, he can thus drive and command the myriad things. Entrusting the talents of the black-haired people, he employs the Dao of the human flock.

**Collation:**
(1) The *Shi De Tang* edition omits this character.
(2) The *Daozang* edition omits the character *er* (而).

The root lies above, the branches below;
The essential lies with the ruler, the details with the ministers.

The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the branch of virtue.
Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the penalties of the five punishments—these are the branches of teaching.
Rites, laws, measures, and numbers; forms, names, and comparisons—these are the branches of governance.
The sounds of bells and drums, the adornments of feathers and plumes—these are the branches of music.
Wailing and weeping, mourning garments, gradations of severity—these are the branches of mourning.

These five branches require the movement of spirit and the activation of the mind’s workings before they can be followed.

**1. Subcommentary:**
The root is the Dao and virtue; the branches are benevolence and righteousness. The Dao and virtue are pure and simple—this is the foundation of governance, practiced in high antiquity. Benevolence and righteousness are shallow and insubstantial—these are the branches of governance, practiced in later ages. Thus it is said: "The root lies above, the branches below."

**Annotation:**
Li says: "The root is the Way of Heaven; the branches are the way of man."

**2. Subcommentary:**
*Yao* means simplicity; *xiang* means complexity. The ruler’s Dao is leisurely and simple; the minister’s Dao is laborious and cumbersome. Cumbersome, thus they act and serve above; simple, thus they practice non-action and govern below.

**3. Subcommentary:**
The five weapons are: (1) the bow, (2) the *shu*, (3) the spear, (4) the dagger-axe, and (5) the halberd. *Yun* means movement. In an age of sagely brightness, one lays aside arms and cultivates culture; when virtue declines, one lays aside culture and cultivates arms. When culture is laid aside and arms are cultivated, the five weapons stir in chaos; when arms are laid aside and culture is cultivated, the four peoples live in peace. The root and branches of virtue may be known from this.

**4. Subcommentary:**
Rewards are chariots, caps, honors, and splendor—thus they are beneficial. Punishments are executions, mutilations, and humiliations—thus they are harmful. *Pi* means law. The five punishments are: (1) nose-cutting, (2) tattooing, (3) foot-cutting, (4) castration, and (5) capital punishment. When the Dao is lost and virtue declines, falsity daily increases, so penal laws are established to govern the common people. Yet this harms the root of principle and becomes but a branch of teaching.

**Annotation:**
"*Zhi pi*" (之辟) is read as *pi chi* (毗赤反).

**5. Subcommentary:**
Rites and laws refer to the laws of the five rites. *Shu* means calculation; *du* means measurement.

Shape refers to appearance and bearing; name refers to given name and taboo; *bi* means comparison and alignment; *xiang* means determination and scrutiny. Employing such methods to nurture the common people, governance departs from the purity of antiquity—thus it remains but a branch of governance.

**Annotation:**
"*Bi xiang*" (比详) is read as *pi zhi* (毗志反). Below, the same.
One pronunciation follows the character’s usual reading, glossed as: comparison, scrutiny, determination, and precision.
"*Zhi zhi*" (治之) is read as *zhi li* (直吏反). Below, from *zhi zhi* to *zhi zhi dao* (治之至道), and the annotation *zhi zhi dao* (至治之道), the same.

**6. Subcommentary:**
Music means harmony. *Yu* refers to bird feathers; *mao* refers to animal fur—speaking of adorning instruments with the feathers and fur of birds and beasts. The reason the sage-kings created music was to harmonize yin and yang above and pacify the customs of the age below. The ancients, upon hearing music, could discern the rise and fall of a state, whether an age was well-governed or chaotic, for their sounds differed. Thus, great music harmonizes with Heaven and Earth—it is not merely the feathers, fur, bells, and drums. Since the Three Dynasties declined, decadence has flourished daily; they prize the lewd sounds of Zheng and Wei, abandoning the refined rhythms of *Yunshao*. Thus, feathers and fur, elaborate adornments, and ostentatious bearing—these are not the root of *Xianchi* but merely the branches of *Pushui*.

**7. Subcommentary:**
*Die* means substance; *cui* means mourning. The upper garment is called *fu* (服); the lower, *shang*. Both the head and waist bear *die*. *Long sha* refers to the gradations of mourning: the five degrees—*zhan cui* (斩衰), *zi cui* (齐衰), *da gong* (大功), *xiao gong* (小功), and *si ma* (缌麻)—each with its own measure of wailing, weeping, and mourning attire. These are but the external traces of teaching, not the emotions welling from within—thus they remain the branches of mourning.

**Annotation:**
"*Cui*" (衰) is read as *cui* (崔). "*Die*" (绖) is read as *tian jie* (田结反). "*Long sha*" (隆杀) is read as *suo jie* (所界反).

**8. Annotation:**
Spirit, essence, and the arts of the heart are the root of the five branches.

**Subcommentary:**
*Shu* means ability; what the heart can do is called the arts of the heart. Spirit, essence, and the arts of the heart are the root of the five branches. These five branches must move in accord with nature, guided by spirit, essence, and the mind’s discernment, before they align with the five affairs—thus they are not forced or artificial. The branches of learning existed among the ancients, yet they were not what came first.

First the ruler, then the minister follows; first the father, then the son follows; first the elder brother, then the younger follows; first the elder, then the younger follows; first the man, then the woman follows; first the husband, then the wife follows.

The precedence of honor and the sequence of before and after are the movements of Heaven and Earth—thus the sages took them as models. Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—these are the positions of the numinous and bright. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the order of the four seasons. The transformations and creations of the myriad things, their sprouts and divisions, each have their forms. The waxing and waning of flourishing and decline are the currents of change.

Though Heaven and Earth are most numinous, they still have the sequence of honor and precedence—how much more so the Dao of humanity! In ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, rank is honored; in village communities, age is honored; in affairs, worthiness is honored—this is the order of the Great Dao. To speak of the Dao while violating its order is not the Dao; to speak of the Dao while not embodying the Dao—how can one grasp the Dao?

**Annotation:**
What comes first is the root.

**Subcommentary:**
The ancients here refer to the people of the middle antiquity. *First* means root. The learning of the five branches existed in middle antiquity, but such matters were tainted by artifice and ultimately not the fundamental root.

**Subcommentary:**
The precedence of honor and the sequence of before and after are the movements of Heaven and Earth.

**Annotation:**
"*Zhang xian er shao*" (长先而少) is read as *shi zhao* (诗照反).

**Annotation:**
Though this sequence of before and after pertains to human affairs, it all arises from the utmost principle—it is not something the sages fabricated.

**Subcommentary:**
The movements of Heaven and Earth refer to spring and summer coming first, autumn and winter following—this is the movement of the four seasons. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they still have honor and lowliness; how much more so human relations, which cannot lack precedence! Thus, the sages modeled themselves on the transformations of the Two Modes and observed the spontaneity of the four sequences, thereby establishing the great righteousness of ruler and minister and rectifying the essential Dao of father and son.

**Subcommentary:**
Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—these are unalterable positions. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is their sequence. These two examples suffice to clarify the myriad things.

**Subcommentary:**
The transformations of the myriad things never cease for even a moment: now rising, now falling; now living, now dying. A thousand clans, ten thousand kinds, their colors and categories differ, yet their sprouts and divisions each have their forms.

**Annotation:**
"*Meng qu*" (萌区) is read as *qu ju* (曲俱反).

**Subcommentary:**
Spring and summer flourish and grow; autumn and winter decline and wane. Some change from life to death, some transform from old to new—this is the natural principle of things, not a matter of deliberate intent. Thus, following the current and letting things be, all that is accomplished is fitting.

**Annotation:**
It is evident that the sequence of honor and precedence is something even things cannot lack.

**Subcommentary:**
The Two Modes give birth and nurture with unfathomable efficacy, most numinous and transformative among the myriad things—yet they still have honor and precedence. How much more so the Dao of human relations!

**Annotation:**
This is not only what human relations honor.

**Subcommentary:**
Ancestral temple affairs are weighty, so they must follow the order of *zhao* and *mu*, with succession by the legitimate heir—thus kinship is honored. In court, rank determines honor; in village communities, age determines precedence; in affairs, the worthy and capable are selected—this is the inevitable principle, hence called the order of the Great Dao.

**Annotation:**
"*Chao ting*" (朝廷) is read as *zhi yao* (直遥反).

**Subcommentary:**
To discuss the Dao while ignorant of its order is to speak empty words, not the language of the Dao.

Once its order is lost, it cannot govern things.

**Annotation:**
The reason we adopt the Dao is precisely because it has order.

**Subcommentary:**
Having failed to recognize this order, even if one speaks, it is not the language of the Dao—how then can one adopt the Dao to enact governance?

Thus the ancients who illuminated the Great Dao first illuminated Heaven, and only then did morality and power follow; once morality and power were illuminated, benevolence and righteousness followed; once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, the division of duties followed; once the division of duties was illuminated, forms and names followed; once forms and names were illuminated, the delegation of tasks according to nature followed; once the delegation of tasks was illuminated, the examination and remission of faults followed; once the examination and remission of faults were illuminated, right and wrong followed; once right and wrong were illuminated, rewards and punishments followed.

Once rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise were placed appropriately, the noble and the base occupied their proper stations; the benevolent and worthy, the unworthy and base—each followed their true nature. Abilities were necessarily distinguished, names necessarily adhered to.

By this, one served superiors; by this, one nurtured subordinates; by this, one governed things; by this, one cultivated the self. Scheming and calculation were set aside, and one necessarily returned to Heaven. This is called Great Peace, the ultimate state of governance.

**Annotation:**
Heaven is nature. Once nature is illuminated, things attain their Dao.

**Subcommentary:**
This further expounds the meaning of the order of the Great Dao. It states that the ancients who illuminated the Great Dao first illuminated the principle of nature, for nature is the root of morality and power, and thus morality and power followed.

**Annotation:**
When things attain their Dao, harmony arises, and principle naturally aligns.

**Subcommentary:**
First virtue, then benevolence; first benevolence, then righteousness—thus benevolence and righteousness followed.

**Annotation:**
When principle aligns, duties are not lost.

**Subcommentary:**
Having practiced the benevolence of universal love and illuminated the righteousness of correcting wrongs, one next ensured that each guarded their duties, without encroachment or contention.

**Annotation:**
When duties are established, the names of all things correspond to their forms.

**Subcommentary:**
*Xing* (形) means "body." Each guarding their duties without encroachment or contention, one next encouraged self-cultivation to attain reputation.

**Annotation:**
Nothing further needs to be altered.

**Subcommentary:**
Though self-cultivation was encouraged to attain reputation, one must still follow innate dispositions and employ natural abilities—one cannot falsify nature or feign emotion to seek fame.

**Annotation:**
When things are entrusted to their own natures, blame and responsibility are removed.

**Subcommentary:**
*Yuan* (原) means "remission"; *sheng* (省) means "removal." Though one followed innate nature in delegation, transgressions were not absent, so one should extend lenient grace and pardon their faults.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*Yuan sheng* (原省): *suǒ jǐng fǎn*. *Yuan*: to remit; *sheng*: to remove.

To *sheng* (省) means to abolish.

**Annotation:**
Each regards attaining its nature as right and losing its nature as wrong.

**Subcommentary:**
Though one pardoned transgressions and remitted faults, human hearts gradually thinned, so one next had to demonstrate right and wrong as a mirror and warning.

**Annotation:**
Rewards and punishments are the retribution of loss and gain. The Way of perfect governance begins in Heaven and does not culminate here.

**Subcommentary:**
With right and wrong made clear, good and bad became manifest, so one rewarded the virtuous and punished the wicked to exhort the common people.

**Annotation:**
Officials each matched their talents.

**Subcommentary:**
Employing these rewards and punishments in sequence to establish governance, the wise were placed in brightness or darkness as befitted them, while the talented—whether high or low—all occupied their proper stations.

**Annotation:**
Each acted according to their innate capacities.

**Subcommentary:**
The benevolent and worthy were wise; the unworthy were foolish. *Xi* (袭) means "to employ." When the sovereign was sagely and enlightened, transforming and guiding all fittingly, though the wise and foolish differed, each employed their inherent nature and never abandoned themselves to imitate others or boastfully display their abilities.

**Annotation:**
No interchange of duties.

**Subcommentary:**
As natures differed and things varied, skills and capacities were inherently distinct, and functions necessarily divided. Treating them like vessels, none failed to be harmoniously suited.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*Bì fēn* (必分): *fāng yún* (方云) *fǎn* (反).

**Annotation:**
Names corresponded to reality, so from names one attained reality without excess.

**Subcommentary:**
Names summoned reality, and because they corresponded to reality, names arose. If reality did not derive from names, then names exceeded reality. Here, names and reality matched, so it is said they necessarily derived from their names.

**Subcommentary:**
*Yǐ* (以) means "to employ." Employing the preceding nine methods, one could serve as a minister to one’s superior, as a ruler to nurture one’s subjects, govern externally, and cultivate oneself internally.

**Subcommentary:**
Utterly silent and non-active, entrusting all to the masses, blocking off cunning and closing wisdom to return to spontaneity—this could be called the sovereign of Great Peace, the beauty of perfect governance.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*Zhī móu* (知谋): pronounced *zhì* (智). *Dà píng* (大平): pronounced *tài* (泰).

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The *Shì dé táng* edition reads *yán* (言) instead of *guān* (官).
(2) The characters *dāng* (当) and *yóu* (由) are transposed according to the annotation.

The ancients said: "There are forms and names." Forms and names existed among the ancients, but they were not what came first.

**Annotation:**
"First" means "fundamental." Forms, names, and such methods were but the traces to which the sages responded—used out of necessity, not as the fundamental path. The *Shū* (书) refers to Daoist texts, which, having suffered burning in the Qin era, now lack reliable evidence when examined.

**Annotation:**
From first clarifying Heaven onward, to forms and names is five changes, and to rewards and punishments is nine—this is the natural order of priority.

**Subcommentary:**
The substance of governance must follow the turbidity or purity of the age. As eras vary in refinement or coarseness, governance likewise varies in leniency or strictness. Thus, five changes and nine changes could be implemented and articulated. If the sequence was not lost, this was the Great Peace of perfect governance.

**Subcommentary:**
*Zhòu* (骤) means "frequent" or "hasty." People of the degenerate age, ignorant of proper order, frequently spoke of forms and names as methods of governance, yet without embodying the nine changes that took spontaneity as their foundation. They grasped only the branches, not the root.

**Subcommentary:**
To hastily discuss rewards and punishments as a means to govern the age was to see only the twigs and leaves, not the root. *Shǐ* (始) means "root," differing only in name.

**Annotation:**
One who governs others must follow the proper sequence.

**Subcommentary:**
*Wǔ* (迕) means "contrary." Those who did not recognize the methods of governance, ignorant of sequence, inverted the Way and acted contrary to the nature of things—such could only be governed by others, how could they govern others?

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*Wǔ dào* (迕道): pronounced *wù* (悟). Sima: "transverse." To hastily speak of forms, names, rewards, and punishments was to possess the tools of governance but not the Way of governance. These could be employed in the world but were insufficient to employ the world—such were called sophists, partial men.

Rites, laws, measures, and degrees, with forms and names compared in detail, existed among the ancients. These were how inferiors served superiors, not how superiors nurtured inferiors.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*"Ér yuè"* (《而说》): pronounced *yuè* (悦), or read as written.

**Commentary:**
The Way of governance begins with clarifying Heaven’s principles; it does not abandon rewards and punishments, but one must not lose the proper sequence of priority.

**Subcommentary:**
Forms, names, rewards, and punishments are but the instruments of governance, not its essential Dao.

**Commentary:**
Those who would employ the world must thoroughly comprehend the Dao of sequence.

**Subcommentary:**
If forms, names, rewards, and punishments could be applied to the world, they would be insufficient to employ the world. Such are but sophists who adorn themselves with florid words, partial men of limited vision who grasp a single branch but cannot perceive the universal principle or awaken to the great Dao.

**Commentary:**
To delegate these matters to the many talents is to nurture inferiors.

**Subcommentary:**
This reiterates the previous point. The ancients did so, but they merely entrusted matters to the many talents without personal involvement—this is the art of ministers, not the Way by which rulers nurture the people. Here concludes the chapter, clarifying the intent of root and branch.

In ancient times, Shun asked Yao: “How does the Son of Heaven apply his mind?”

**Subcommentary:**
*Son of Heaven* means *emperor*. Shun asked Yao about the method of emperors and kings, how to align the mind with the great Dao.

Yao said: “I do not disdain the unteachable, nor abandon the destitute. I grieve for the dead, commend the young, and pity women. This is how I apply my mind.”

**Commentary:**
The *unteachable* refers to the so-called obstinate people.

**Subcommentary:**
*Disdain* means to slight or scorn. The *unteachable* are those so foolish they cannot be instructed. Yao answered Shun: “Even for the obstinate and unteachable, I diligently teach them without disdain or abandonment.” Thus the *Laozi* says, “To those who are not good, I also extend goodness.” *Disdain* may also be written as *teach*, but this is not used here.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*"Bù ào"* (不敖): pronounced *wǔ* (五报反).

**Commentary:**
I constantly extend kindness.

**Subcommentary:**
To the poor among the people, I always offer relief—this mind does not waver.

**Subcommentary:**
*Young children* means infants. *Pity* means compassion. When people die, I grieve and console them. For infants and widows, I show compassion and commend their care.

**Subcommentary:**
*Already* means *to cease*. Summarizing the above, this answers Shun’s question: “My application of mind ceases here.”

Shun said: “Fine indeed, but not yet great.”

**Subcommentary:**
The application of mind to governance is fine, but the Way is narrow and inferior—it cannot be called great. Having received Yao’s answer, Shun thus offered this critique.

Yao said: “Then what should it be?”

**Subcommentary:**
Having been critiqued, Yao thus sought further instruction: “What is the great art of the Way of governance?”

Shun said: “Embody Heaven’s virtue and emerge in tranquility. The sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed, like the constancy of day and night, like clouds moving and rain falling.”

**Commentary:**
To unite with Heaven’s virtue is to act yet remain still.

**Subcommentary:**
The method of nurturing life aligns with the mysterious Heaven’s virtue; though the traces are manifest, the mind remains ever tranquil.

**Commentary:**
All these occur naturally, without contrivance.

**Subcommentary:**
*Constancy* means *permanence*. The sun and moon radiate brilliance, illuminating the six directions; cold and heat alternate as the four seasons revolve; day and night follow their course; clouds drift and rain falls—these are the great virtues of Heaven and Earth, the constant Dao of nature. Without partiality in mind, how could there be deliberate nurturing? The Way of emperors and kings is likewise.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*"Yǔ shī"* (雨施): pronounced *shǐ* (始豉反).

Yao said, "How restless and chaotic! You are the union of Heaven; I am the union of man."

**Commentary:**
He reproached himself for being meddlesome.

**Subcommentary:**
*Jiaojiao* and *raorao* both describe a state of disturbance. Upon grasping these words, he reproached himself for being overly involved, and so they exchanged modest deference.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*"Jiaojiao"* (胶胶): pronounced *jiao mao* (交卯反). Sima [Biao] says: harmonious.
*"Raorao"* (扰扰): pronounced *er xiao* (而小反). Sima [Biao] says: gentle.
Note: If following the main interpretation, *jiaojiao raorao* describes a state of turmoil.

**Subcommentary:**
Yao humbly deferred, yielding to Shun, saying: "Your great virtue aligns with Heaven above, while my efforts merely accord with human affairs." Now, Yao and Shun were two sages whose virtue was without distinction; thus, this exchange between the two exemplars illustrates the proper way of governance.

Heaven and Earth are what the ancients revered most, and what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all celebrated together. Therefore, those who ruled all under Heaven in ancient times—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.

**Subcommentary:**
From this point onward, the words are those of Zhuangzi. Heaven covers and Earth bears, giving life to all things; among the Four Great of the world, these two stand supreme. Thus, he invokes the ancients to affirm their virtue in the present.

**Subcommentary:**
Only Heaven is great, and Yao emulated it. Thus, we know that the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Yao, and Shun all took aligning their virtue with Heaven and Earth as their highest achievement.

**Subcommentary:**
What did the ancient sage-kings who embodied the Dao do? They followed things without contrivance, their virtue uniting with the Two Modes [Heaven and Earth].

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*"Zhi wang"* (之王): pronounced *wang kuang* (往况反).

Confucius went west to deposit his writings in the Zhou archives. Zilu advised, "I have heard that among the Zhou’s *Zhengcang* officials there is one named Lao Dan who has resigned and returned home. If you wish to deposit your writings, you might try visiting him first."

**Subcommentary:**
His surname was Zhong, given name You, courtesy name Zilu, a disciple of Confucius. Seeing that the virtue of Zhou had declined beyond remedy, Confucius could not assist in its restoration. Thus, he wished to deposit his own writings in the Zhou archives, hoping they might serve as a model for future rulers. He consulted his disciples to weigh the matter. Laozi’s surname was Li, given name Dan, and he served as the *Zhengcang* official of Zhou, akin to today’s archivist, responsible for ancient texts. Seeing the Zhou court in turmoil, he resigned his post and retired to a quiet life. Thus, Zilu advised Confucius to visit him and seek his counsel.

**Phonetic Annotation:**
*"Cangshu"* (藏书): Sima [Biao] says: to deposit the books he had written.
*"Zhengcang"* (征藏): pronounced *cai lang* (才浪反). Sima [Biao] says: *Zhengcang* is the name of an archive. Another interpretation: *zheng* means "to oversee."
*"Shi"* (史): the historian of the archives.
*"Lao Dan"* (老聃): pronounced *tu gan* (吐甘反). Some say: Lao Dan was the name of Laozi in Confucius’ time.
*"Mian er gui"* (免而归): Laozi saw that the end of Zhou was beyond repair, so he resigned and departed.

Confucius said, "Very well."

Confucius went to visit Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused his request. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him.

Laozi, recognizing that the texts Confucius wished to preserve were but the withered straw dogs of former sages—unfit to be long retained lest they mislead later generations—thus refused. Confucius, having edited the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, established the rites and music, composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, and expounded the *Book of Changes*, these being the Six Classics; adding the Six Wefts, they became the Twelve Classics. He unfolded and expounded them in detail, thus turning and returning to his argument.

Lao Dan, moved by his discourse, said, "This is all too vast and reckless! I would hear its essentials."

Confucius replied, "The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness."

Laozi asked, "May I ask: are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?"

Confucius said, "Indeed. The noble person who lacks benevolence cannot achieve completion, and without righteousness cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity—what more is there to say?"

Laozi said, "May I ask: what are benevolence and righteousness?"

Confucius replied, "A heart that delights in all things, universal love without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness."

Laozi said, "Ah! These words come perilously close to folly! Is not universal love overly circuitous? And in claiming to be without partiality, one becomes partial. If you, Master, wish the Son of Heaven to lose nothing of his governance, then know this: Heaven and Earth have their constancy, sun and moon their brightness, stars and constellations their order, birds and beasts their flocks, trees and plants their standing. You, Master, should emulate virtue and act, follow the Dao and proceed—this is already perfection. Why then do you clamor for benevolence and righteousness as if beating a drum in search of a lost child? Ah! You, Master, confuse human nature!"

The myriad things are all self-sufficient.

Beasts with awareness and plants without feeling each attain their standing and possess their flocks and ranks—how could this depend on benevolence and righteousness?

This does not require universal love.

To follow one’s virtue and wander freely through the world, to move in step with the Dao of Heaven and tread the paths of men—there is no more wondrous way of conduct in the human realm than this.

If one strains body and mind, bearing the burden of benevolence and righteousness, forcing their practice upon the world to teach all living beings, how is this different from striking a great drum in search of a lost child? The louder the drum’s sound, the farther the lost one flees; the more prominently benevolence and righteousness are displayed, the farther one strays from the Dao—thus there is no way to attain it.

Love as the occasion demands, halt when righteousness calls—this is to forget benevolence and righteousness. To dwell upon them constantly is to disrupt the true.

The lost child is not found, the fault lies in the drum’s clamor; the true nature remains obscured, the error stems from benevolence and righteousness. Thus the sigh is uttered, and the matter concluded.

Shi Chengqi came before Laozi and asked, “I have heard that you, Master, are a sage. I did not hesitate to journey from afar, wishing to meet you, enduring a hundred lodgings with calloused feet, never daring to rest. Yet now I observe you and find you are no sage. There is leftover grain in the rat’s burrow, yet you cast aside those who are ignorant—this is not benevolence. Raw and cooked provisions lie unfinished before you, yet you amass and hoard without end.”

Laozi remained silent and unresponsive.

The next day, Shi Chengqi came again and said, “Yesterday I spoke critically of you, but today my heart is empty and still. Why is this?”

Laozi replied, “The one skilled in wisdom and divine sagacity—I have long since cast off such a name. In the past, when you called me an ox, you called me an ox; when you called me a horse, you called me a horse. If one truly possesses the reality, yet others give a name and one does not accept it, one will suffer harm twice over. I wear my usual garb, always my garb; I do not wear it because it is a garb.”

Laozi said, “As for those skilled in cunning wisdom and divine sagacity—I have long since cast off and moved past such a state. When you called me an ox, I called myself an ox; when you called me a horse, I called myself a horse. If one truly possesses the reality, yet rejects the name others give, one will suffer harm twice over. My bearing is ever my bearing; I do not adopt it because it is a bearing.”

Shi Chengqi, stepping aside like a wild goose in flight and treading cautiously, advanced and asked, “How ought one cultivate the self?”

Laozi replied, “Your countenance is steep and towering, your gaze piercing and sharp, your brow high and exposed, your mouth gaping and fierce, your demeanor stiff and strained—you stand as though tethered like a horse. Your movements are restrained, your reactions swift as a crossbow’s trigger, your scrutiny precise, your knowledge cunning yet tainted by excess. All this betrays a lack of trustworthiness. At the borderlands there dwells one called the Thief.”

◎ Qing Fan notes that *yì* should be read as *é*. *Yìrán* means "lofty," *éran* likewise. For further discussion, see Yu Yue’s *Pingyi* on the "Dasheng Shi" chapter. Both Guo Xiang’s commentary and the subcommentary err in this regard.

**[Six]**
**Commentary:** The mind is set on galloping.
**Subcommentary:** Though his form appears solemn, his heart and nature are restless and agitated, like a swift horse tethered, his mind set on running free.

**[Seven]**
**Commentary:** He cannot relax and let go.
**Subcommentary:** His emotions chase after external things, reacting to every encounter, unable to follow his natural inclinations, constrained in every matter.

**[Eight]**
**Commentary:** His approach and withdrawal are swift.
**Subcommentary:** *Jī* refers to the trigger of a crossbow. His mind clings and climbs, reacting to circumstances with such sudden force that it resembles the release of a crossbow’s trigger.

**[Nine]**
**Commentary:** He discerns right and wrong.
**Subcommentary:** Unable to empty himself and forget both opposition and compliance, he scrutinizes right and wrong, his mind fixed and judgmental.

**[Ten]**
**Commentary:** *Tai* means excess beyond one’s inherent nature. Skill in recognizing excess leads to clumsiness in embracing simplicity.
**Subcommentary:** *Tai* means "excess." Unable to forget cunning and knowledge, to perceive the principle of non-action, he resorts to deceitful wisdom and artifice, seeing only the multiplicity of worldly affairs.

**[Eleven]**
**Commentary:** All these ten traits reveal a lack of trustworthiness in one’s nature and life, leading to recklessness in the face of praise and blame—none of this is the Way of self-cultivation.
**Subcommentary:** *Xin* means "real." These ten traits are all deceptive behaviors, not true virtue.
◎ Jia Shifu remarks: Guo Xiang says, "All these ten traits reveal a lack of trustworthiness in one’s nature and life, leading to recklessness in the face of praise and blame." The phrasing here adds an extra turn. "All reveal a lack of trustworthiness" means that all his actions arise from artificiality, not aligning with the natural Dao, hence called "untrustworthy." His bearing, gaze, brow, mouth, and demeanor—any hint of restraint is like a horse tethered to curb its wildness, unable to trust his own heart. His reactions are swift, his responses mechanical, his knowledge and cunning prevailing—unable to trust the external world. These subtly divide into two meanings and cannot be counted as ten distinct traits.

**[Twelve]**
**Commentary:** This is like your conduct—you are no upright person.
**Subcommentary:** *Qiè* means "thief." At the borderlands, there suddenly appears a man who fears no laws, engaging only in theft. Internally, he corrupts customs; externally, he severs relations with neighboring states. No greater harm to governance and all things exists. Cheng Qi’s behavior is just as base—his every move is as wild and unruly as this thief.
**Exegetical Notes:** *Biān jìng* is pronounced like *jìng* (border). *Yǒu rén yān, qí míng wèi qiè*: A man of the frontier, untouched by the proper rites and music, may speak words that coincidentally align with the classics, but all is stolen knowledge—how can his Way be worth discussing? Sima [Biao] says: This refers to a man once found in distant lands.
**Collation:** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition has *jìng* instead of *jìng*. (2) The Shidetang edition has *zhī* instead of *rú*.

The Master said: “The Dao, in its vastness, does not come to an end; in its minuteness, does not omit anything—thus all things are complete within it. Boundless is its capacity to embrace all, unfathomable its depth. Form, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the outermost traces of spirit—who but the perfected person can rightly discern them?

The perfected person engages with the world—is this not grand? Yet it does not burden him. The world stirs in turmoil, but he does not join in its strife. He examines what requires no reliance and does not shift with profit. He attains the truth of things and holds fast to their root. Thus he transcends heaven and earth, leaves behind the ten thousand things, and his spirit is never constrained.

In harmony with the Dao, aligned with virtue, he sets aside benevolence and righteousness, treats rites and music as guests—such is the settled mind of the perfected person.”

**[One]**
**Subcommentary:** Zhuang Zhou studied under Laozi, hence he is called "the Master." *Zhōng* means "to exhaust." Though the two primal forces are vast, they remain within the Dao and cannot exhaust its measure. Though the tip of an autumn hair is small, it relies on the Dao to take form—thus the Dao does not omit even the smallest. Since it can be both vast and minute, we know all things are complete within it.

**[Two]**
**Subcommentary:** So vast it encompasses all, so fine it penetrates all, threading through the ten thousand things, embracing the two primal forces—thus we call it boundless in its breadth, profound in its depth.
◎ Qing Fan notes: *Guǎngguǎng* is akin to *kuàngkuàng*, describing emptiness and absence of people. The *Book of Han*, "Five Elements Treatise," states: "When an army sets out past the proper time, this is called *guǎng*." Li Qi says: *Guǎng* is pronounced *kuàng*. *Kuàng* and *guǎng* share the same meaning in ancient script. The *Book of Han*, "Biographies of the Five Sons of Emperor Wu," records: "How *guǎngguǎng* is the road!" Su Lin says: *Guǎng* is pronounced *kuàng*.

**[Three]**
**Subcommentary:** Form, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the outermost traces of spirit, not its true essence. They are remedies for the world’s ills, employed only when necessary. Who but the most sagely and spiritual person can rightly discern their coarse and refined aspects?

**[Four]**
**Commentary:** Engaging with the world, he does not fear its vastness.
**Subcommentary:** The sage’s power spans the realm, ruling over the world, occupying the throne of the ninefold virtue—is this not grand? Yet like the immortal of Guye or the sage of Fenyang, he forgets things and self, moving yet still, untroubled by the four seas.

**[Five]**
**Commentary:** He remains still and follows along.
**Subcommentary:** *Qì* means "power" or "influence." *Xié* means "to dwell." When the altars of soil and grain collapse and the world falls into chaos, those who rush about in the world stir up power—but the sage remains still and self-possessed, not joining in the tumult.

**[Six]**
**Commentary:** He examines what requires no reliance and does not shift with profit.
**Subcommentary:** He scrutinizes what is without falsehood and does not change for gain.

**[Seven]**
**Subcommentary:** He attains the truth of things and holds fast to their root.

**[Eight]**
**Subcommentary:** Thus he transcends heaven and earth, leaves behind the ten thousand things, and his spirit is never constrained.

**[Nine]**
**Subcommentary:** In harmony with the Dao, aligned with virtue.

**[Ten]**
**Subcommentary:** He sets aside benevolence and righteousness.

**[Eleven]**
**Subcommentary:** He treats rites and music as guests.

**[Twelve]**
**Subcommentary:** Such is the settled mind of the perfected person.

**[Exegesis]**
*Fèn* (奋) is pronounced *bǐng*. Sima [Biao] says: "might and authority." Li [Yi] reads it as *chǒu lún*. One version writes it as *dòng* (栋). ◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Exegesis* cites Sima [Biao]’s gloss—*bǐng* (柄) as "might and authority." The *Shuowen* states: "A *bǐng* is a handle." *Bǐng* (柄) is sometimes written as *bǐng* (棅). The *Guanzi*’s *Shanquan Shu* says: "To grasp the fullness and emptiness of the state’s calculations is called *guóquán* (state authority); this refers to the ruler. To regulate the weight of human affairs is called *jūn* (lordship)." A *bǐng* is that by which affairs are regulated. The great regulate the great; the small regulate the small. All who rise together to act in the world rely on something. The *Shuowen* says: "To *jiǎ* (假) is to borrow." Without something to borrow, there is no action; without action, one drifts like grass in the wind, like waves in the current, shifting with things. Without reliance and without shifting for profit—this is called "non-action yet nothing left undone." Guo Xiang says it means "following one’s nature and proceeding directly," which is incorrect.

**[Six]**
**Commentary:** Following one’s nature and proceeding directly.

**Subcommentary:** His will and nature are tranquil; he entrusts himself to fate and follows his nature. Neither glory nor position touches his heart—how could wealth or profit sway him?

**[Seven]**
**Subcommentary:** The sage’s spirit-mirror is penetrating and clear; he exhausts principle and fulfills his nature, thus attaining the truth of things. Yet his responses are boundless, and his movement does not disrupt stillness—he holds fast to the root.

**[Eight]**
**Subcommentary:** Though he grasps the charts and governs the realm, ruling over all directions, he forgets the two poles [heaven and earth] and abandons the ten thousand things. Thus, with non-action, affairs become non-affairs; his mind is at ease, his spirit sovereign—what exhaustion or constraint could there be?

**[Nine]**
**Subcommentary:** His mind of tranquil indifference communicates with the supreme Dao; his wisdom of empty forgetfulness aligns with the highest virtue. Here, realm and wisdom meet, and ability and object merge in darkness.

**[Ten]**
**Commentary:** He advances the Dao and virtue.

**[Eleven]**
**Commentary:** He takes essence and nature as his master.

**Subcommentary:** He retreats from the shallowness of benevolence and righteousness and advances the purity of Dao and virtue; he casts aside the flamboyance of rites and music and upholds the emptiness of non-action. ◎ Yu Yue says: *Bīn* (宾) should be read as *bìn* (摈), meaning to cast aside rites and music, matching the previous line’s "retreat from benevolence and righteousness." Guo’s commentary—"taking essence and nature as his master"—reads it as the original character, but the meaning becomes circuitous. The *Dá Shēng* chapter says: "Cast aside by his village, pursued by his district"—this is evidence of *bīn* being used for *bìn*. ◎ Qing Fan notes: Yu’s argument is sound. Since *bīn* and *bìn* share the same pronunciation, characters with identical sounds are often borrowed for one another. The *Zhōu Lǐ*’s *Sī Yí* states: "*Bīn* bows and presents gifts," and the *Exegesis* notes: "*Bīn* is pronounced *bìn*." In this book’s *Xú Wúguǐ* chapter, "*Bīn* to my humble self," the Sima edition writes *bīn* as *bìn*—further proof.

**[Twelve]**
**Commentary:** Settled in non-action.

**Subcommentary:** Serene and inactive, yet his use does not deviate from stillness—thus he is settled.

**[Collation]**
(1) The *Quēwù* edition cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript, which repeats the character *yuān* (渊).

What the world values in the Dao is the *book* **[One]**—yet a book is no more than words, and words have what is valued in them. What is valued in words is *meaning* **[Two]**, and meaning has what it follows. What meaning follows cannot be transmitted in speech **[Three]**—yet the world values speech for transmitting books. Though the world values them **[One]**, I still do not find them sufficient, for what they value is not what is truly valuable **[Four]**. Thus, what can be seen when looking are forms and colors; what can be heard when listening are names and sounds. Alas! The world takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the truth of things! Yet if forms, colors, names, and sounds are truly insufficient to grasp the truth of things **[Five]**, then the knower does not speak, and the speaker does not know—how could the world recognize this **[Six]**?

**[One]**
**Subcommentary:** The *Dao* refers to speech; the *book* refers to writing. The world’s people, with their shallow perceptions, either rely on speech to convey the heart or use writing to express intent, reciting and exchanging them as if they were precious. They do not realize there is nothing sufficient to be spoken.

**[Two]**
**Subcommentary:** The purpose of writing is to convey speech; the purpose of conveying speech is to express meaning.

**[Three]**
**Subcommentary:** *Suí* (随) means "to follow." What meaning arises from follows the Dao. Since the Dao is neither form nor sound, it cannot be transmitted in speech.

**Exegesis:** *Yánchuán* (言传) is pronounced *zhàng zhuān*. The same applies below.

**[Four]**
**Commentary:** What is truly valuable always lies beyond words and speech.
**Subcommentary:** Writing serves to record speech, and speech serves to convey meaning. Yet people of this degenerate age, their minds dull and obstructed, value words and writings excessively, unable to forget language in pursuit of principle. Thus, though they prize them, I still deem them unworthy of esteem—for words and writings are but dregs, not things of true value. Hence Guo’s commentary states: *What is truly valuable always lies beyond words and speech.*

**Exegesis:** *Wéiqí* (为其) is pronounced *yúwěi*.

**[Five]**
**Commentary:** Only those who forget words and abandon writings can grasp the true nature of things.
**Subcommentary:** What the eye perceives does not exceed forms and colors; what the ear hears is confined to names and sounds. Yet the world’s people, failing to comprehend the ultimate principle, mistake names, words, sounds, and appearances for the full reality of the Dao. How could they know that the profound and boundless lies beyond the reach of sight and hearing? Such ignorance is deeply lamentable. Hence Guo’s commentary states: *Only those who forget words and abandon writings can grasp the true nature of things.*

**[Six]**
**Commentary:** This expresses the meaning of *cutting off learning and discarding knowledge.*
**Subcommentary:** Those who know the Dao forget words; those who value virtue forget knowledge. Yet the deaf and deluded masses—how could they awaken? Only those of true understanding can embody this.
**Exegesis:** *Zhīzhě* (知者) is read as *zhī*; the same applies below. Alternatively, both may be read as *zhì*. *Qùshàng* (去尚) is pronounced *qǐlǚ*.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The *Shide Tang* edition includes the character *zāi* (哉) below.
(2) The character *zhī* (之) is supplied following the Song edition and the subcommentary.

Duke Huan was reading in the hall above. Below, Wheelwright Pian was hewing a wheel, and setting aside his mallet and chisel, he ascended and asked Duke Huan: “May I dare ask—what words are those Your Lordship reads?”

**[One]**
**Subcommentary:** Duke Huan was Duke Huan of Qi. *Lún* (轮) means “wheel”; *Piān* (扁) was the name of the craftsman. *Zhuó* (斲) means “to carve.” *Shì* (释) means “to set aside.” The lord of Qi was engrossed in reading, while Wheelwright Pian was crafting a wheel—noble and commoner differed in rank, their tasks in kind. Yet he set aside his tools to pose his question, intending to show that the profoundness of the ultimate Dao cannot be transmitted in speech. Thus, through the figures of Duke Huan and the craftsman, he briefly reveals the attainment of forgetting words.
**Exegesis:** *Huángōng* (桓公): Li [Xian] says: Duke Huan of Qi, named Xiaobai.
*Lúnbiǎn* (轮扁): Pronounced *piān*; alternatively, *fútiǎn*.
Sima [Biao] says: A wheelwright, named Pian.
*Zhuó* (斲): Pronounced *zhíjué*.
*Érshàng* (而上): Pronounced *shízhǎng*.

**Collation Note:**
(1) The *Shide Tang* edition has *zhě* (者) as *zuò* (作).

The Duke said: “The words of the sages.”

**[One]**
**Subcommentary:** These were the canons of Wen and Wu, the teachings handed down from Yao and Shun—words of the sages.

“Are the sages still alive?”

**[One]**
**Subcommentary:** He further asked: “Are the sages still living?”

The Duke said: “They have already died.”

**[One]**
**Subcommentary:** He replied: “Though the sages are dead, their teachings remain.”

“Then what Your Lordship reads are but the dregs and lees of the ancients!”

**[One]**
**Subcommentary:** *Fū* (夫): Wine sediment is called *zāo* (糟); soaked sediment is called *pò* (粕). Fine wine compared to the Dao and virtue is like dregs and lees compared to benevolence and righteousness—stale as straw dogs, what are they worth?
**Exegesis:** *Zāo* (糟): Pronounced *zāo*. Li [Xian] says: The sediment of wine.
*Pò* (魄): Pronounced *pǔgè*. Sima [Biao] says: Rotten food is called *pò*. Another says: *Pò* is what remains when sediment rots. Originally written as *pò* (粕), same pronunciation. Xu Shen says: *Pò* is the coarse sediment left after straining. Alternatively, pronounced *pǔbái*, meaning *húnpò* (魂魄).
*Yǐfū* (已夫): Pronounced *yífú*. A terminal particle. Alternatively, read as written.

◎ Qing Fan’s note on *Shiwen*: *Pò* (魄) is alternatively written as *pò* (粕), which is the version in Sima’s text. *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Lu Shiheng’s *Wen Fu* cites Sima: “Rotten food is called *pò* (粕).”

Duke Huan said: “When We read books, how dare a wheelwright pass judgment! If you have an explanation, you may live; if not, you shall die.”

**Subcommentary [One]:** Noble and base are separated by ritual; one must not speak lightly. Yet this common craftsman dares to offer his opinion. If his explanation is reasonable, he may be spared guilt; if he has no words, he will surely incur the death penalty.

Wheelwright Pian replied: “Your servant observes it through his own craft. In carving wheels, if done too slowly, the fit is smooth but not firm; if too swiftly, it is rough and does not penetrate. Neither too slow nor too swift—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart, yet the mouth cannot express it; there is a method inherent in the process. Your servant cannot make his son understand it, nor can his son receive it from him. Thus, though I am seventy years old, I still carve wheels in my old age.

**Subcommentary [Two]:** The ancients and what they could not transmit have perished. Yet what Your Lordship reads are but the dregs and lees of the ancients!”

**Subcommentary [One]:**
"Gan" means "leisurely"; "ku" means "hurried." "Shu" means "technique." If the wheel-carving misses its proper measure, it will not be secure. But when it is done just right, the mouth cannot express it. How much more is this true of the principles of teaching and learning!

**Explication of Terms:**
"Gan" is read as in the standard pronunciation, or alternatively as *han*. Sima [Biao] says: "Gan" means "leisurely"; "ku" means "hurried." "You shu": Li [Yi] says: *shu* is read with the entering tone (se zhu fan), meaning "technique." ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Given that the preceding and following instances all read *shu* with the entering tone, this annotation may contain an error.

**Subcommentary [Two]:**
This speaks of how things each possess their own nature, and how teaching and learning are of no avail.

**Subcommentary:**
"Yu" means "to make clear." Wheelwright Pian’s technique cannot be demonstrated to his son, nor can his son receive his instruction. Thus, though he has reached old age, he cannot escape the toil of the axe and adze. From this we know that things each have their own nature and cannot be imitated.

**Commentary [Three]:**
The affairs of antiquity have already perished in antiquity. Even if some part of them has been transmitted, how could it make the ancient present in the present? Since the ancient is not in the present, present affairs have already changed. Thus, one must sever learning and follow one’s nature, adapting to the transformations of the times before attaining the Dao.

**Subcommentary:**
The sages established their methods to benefit the world in accordance with the times. Since time does not stand still, the methods must also change. Thus, the people and laws of antiquity have perished in the past, while the laws and people of the present naturally arise in the present. There is no place for clinging to the traces of the ancient sages in the present age. From this we know that the books one reads are surely the dregs and lees.

**Explication of Terms:**
"Ren yu" is read as in the standard pronunciation, or alternatively as *yu*. "Ke chuan" is read with the retroflex (zhi zhuan fan). The commentary is the same.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The character *bu* ("not") is supplied in accordance with the main text.
(2) The Zhao Jiayi edition reads *gu* ("ancient") as *jin* ("present").
(3) The Zhao edition reads *mie* ("perished") as *jian* ("diminished").

*Outer Chapters, "Heavenly Revolutions," Chapter Fourteen*

**Outer Chapters, "Heavenly Revolutions," Chapter Fourteen**

**[1] Explication of the Title:**
The chapter is named according to its meaning. *Tian yun* ("Heavenly Revolutions") is rendered as *Tian yuan* ("Heavenly Roundness") in Sima’s version.

Does Heaven revolve?
Does Earth abide in stillness?
Do the sun and moon contend for their places?
Who presides over these?
Who maintains their order?
Who, dwelling in inaction, sets them in motion?
Is there some mechanism that compels them, leaving them no choice?
Or do they revolve ceaselessly, unable to halt themselves?
Do clouds give rise to rain?
Or does rain give rise to clouds?
Who bestows this abundance?
Who, dwelling in inaction, indulges in excess and yet urges them on?
Winds arise from the north, now west, now east, drifting upward in restless motion—who exhales and inhales them?
Who, dwelling in inaction, stirs and scatters them?
May I venture to ask the reason?

**[1] Commentary:**
They move not by revolving but by self-propulsion.
**Explication:**
Heaven, endowed with yang qi, is light and floats above; it moves of itself without intent.
**Explication of Terms:**
*Qi yun* ("Does it revolve?"): The *Erya* states: *yun* means "to shift." The *Guangya* states: *yun* means "to turn."
◎Qingfan’s note: *Yun* ("revolve") appears as *yuan* ("round") in Sima’s *Explication*. The characters *yun* and *yuan* were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Yueyu* reads: "A territory of a hundred *li* in breadth," with Wei’s commentary: "East-west is *guang* (breadth); south-north is *yun* (extent)." The *Western Mountains Classic* renders it as "a hundred *li* in *guangyuan* (breadth and roundness)." In the *Mozi*, "Against Fate (Upper)," the phrase "like one who sets the sundial by turning the potter’s wheel" appears as *yun* in the middle chapter, but as *yuan* in the original. *Yun* was also pronounced like *yun* (cloud) in antiquity. *Yun* and *yuan* are interchangeable. In the *Guanzi*, "Admonitions," the line "The four seasons descend as *yun* (clouds), and the myriad things are transformed" uses *yun* for *yun* (revolve). The *Shuowen* defines *zhen* as "also called *yunri* (revolving sun)"; Liu Kui’s commentary on the *Wu Capital Rhapsody* writes *yunri* as *yunri* (cloud sun), where *yun* is *yuan*. In the *Book of Documents*, *Taishi*, the phrase "though it is thus *yunran*" appears in the *Han Shu*, "Biography of Wei Xian," with *yun* written as *yuan*. In the *Book of Songs*, "Emerging from the Eastern Gate," "Let me delight in *yuan* (roundness)"—the *Explication* notes: *yuan* was originally written as *yun*. In the *Odes of Shang*, "Jing yuan," Zheng’s commentary: *yuan* appears as *yun* in the old text. All these serve as evidence.

**[2] Commentary:**
They abide not by stillness but by self-rest.

**[Subcommentary:]**
The earth receives yin qi, its turbidity sinking below, yet it too abides not by stillness but by self-rest.

**[3] Commentary:**
They vie not for place but by self-alternation.

**[Subcommentary:]**
Day and night illumine and overshadow, emerging and vanishing in alternation, naturally thus. Since they bear no sentiment toward alternation, how could they harbor intent in vying for place?

**[4] Subcommentary:]**
*Shu* means "who." *Shi* refers back to the preceding text. The four seasons and eight solar terms, clouds moving and rain descending, nurture the myriad beings, fostering all species—who is the sovereign that governs and enacts this? This line explicates the revolutions of heaven.

**[5] Commentary:**
All is self-so.

**[Subcommentary:]**
Mountains and peaks engender and rear, streams and springs flow and pour, embracing the ten thousand things, bearing them endlessly. Spring’s birth and summer’s growth proceed without error—who upholds this order to achieve such constancy? This line explicates the earth’s abiding.

**[6] Commentary:**
Without it, nothing could be propelled; with it, each has its own affair. Yet who, idle and unoccupied, propels and enacts this? Each moves of itself.

**[Subcommentary:]**
The sun and moon alternate, the stars and constellations shine brightly, each with its own measure, all proceeding from spontaneity. Who, dwelling in idleness, calculates and propels their course? This line explicates the sun and moon’s vying for place. The preceding three instances all pose hypothetical questions to reveal subtle truths. Thus we know all is self-so, with no thing causing it to be thus.

**[Explication of Terms:]**
*Tui er* (propel) is read as written; an alternate pronunciation is *tuī*. Sima’s edition reads *shui* (who).

**[7] Subcommentary:]**
*Ji* means "barrier." *Jian* means "closure." In the dark of winter’s severity and the obscurity of night, one conjectures with intent, supposing there must be a controller barring and sealing, that affairs are thus compelled. Yet by principle’s reckoning, all is self-so. The earth’s immobility follows the same pattern.

**[Explication of Terms:]**
*Jian* is read with the ancient *xian* rhyme, while Xu reads it with the ancient *xian* rhyme. Sima’s edition reads *xian*, glossing it as "drawing forth."

**[8] Commentary:**
Being self-so, it is therefore unknowable.

**[Subcommentary:]**
Consider how, in the height of spring, qi surges forth and the myriad things all come to life; day and night unfold in clarity, and the six directions are bathed in light. The sequence of qi revolves and turns, bringing forth this generation and nurturance. Tracing its principle and purport, no thing causes it to be thus. The revolving of the round heavens follows the same pattern.

**[9] Commentary:**
Neither can act upon the other; each is self-so.

**[Subcommentary:]**
When qi rises and ascends, it becomes clouds; when clouds disperse and descend, they flow and moisten to form rain. Yet tracing their beginning and end, there is no origin to be found. Thus we know neither can act upon the other.

**[Explication of Terms:]**
*Wei yu* is read with the *yu wei* rhyme; the same applies below and in the commentary.

**[10] Subcommentary:**
*Long* means "to arise," *shi* means "to cease." Who causes clouds and rain to arise and pour forth in torrents? Who ceases the sweet rains and brings about this severe drought?

**[Explication of Terms:]**
*Long shi* is read with the *shi* rhyme, *shi shi* rhyme.

◎ Yu Yue notes: This follows the preceding discussion of clouds and rain. *Long* should be *jiang* ("to descend"), meaning "to send down these clouds and rain." In the *Shangshu dazhuan*, Zheng’s commentary on *long gu* reads *long* as *jiang* ("to descend"). Since *long* is derived from the phonetic *jiang*, their ancient pronunciations were the same. In Xunzi’s "Discourse on Heaven," *long li zun xian er wang* appears in the *Han shi waizhuan* as *jiang*. In the *Zhan guo ce*, "In the eighth month, *jiang yu xia*," the *Fengsu tongyi*’s "Sacrificial Canons" chapter reads *jiang* as *long*. This is evidence of their interchangeability in ancient texts.

**[11] Subcommentary:**
Who, dwelling in idleness and at ease, urges and spurs another to create these excessive rains for pleasure? Sima’s edition reads *juan* ("weary").

**[Explication of Terms:]**
*Yin le* is read with the *luo* rhyme, or alternatively the *yue* rhyme. In *er quan* ("and urges"), Sima’s edition reads *quan* as *juan*, glossing it as: read as *sui* ("to follow"), meaning "who, doing nothing, merely follows the heavens in their ceaseless revolving."

**[12] Subcommentary:**
*Panghuang* describes the appearance of turning and revolving. *Xuxi* is like "exhaling and inhaling." *Pifu* is like "fanning and stirring." The north, being the domain of yin qi, is the source of wind. Yet wind blows without intent, drifting east or west as it pleases—now lingering in empty space, now exhaling and inhaling within the mountains, rising and falling in its fanning and stirring, with no fixed pattern. Who, dwelling in idleness, does this? It is simply the natural course.

**[Exegetical Notes:]**
*You shang* is read with the *shizhang* rhyme. *Pang* is read with the *bohuang* rhyme. *Huang* is read with the *huang* rhyme. Sima’s edition reads *panghuang* as *panghuang*, glossing it as: *panghuang* means a whirlwind. *Xu* is read with the *xu* rhyme. *Xi* is read with the *xiji* rhyme. *Pi* is read with the *fangpi* rhyme. *Fu* is read with the *fangfu* rhyme; Guo reads it with the *fufu* rhyme. *Pifu* describes the appearance of wind. Sima’s edition reads it as *fu*.

**[13] Annotation:**
This poses a question about the reason for things being as they are.

**Subcommentary:**
This line broadly questions what prior intent caused this.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) *Que wu* cites Li’s edition, where *shi* ("to apply") is written as *chi* ("to relax").
(2) *Que wu* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, where *you* ("there is") is written as *zai* ("exists").

Wu Xian Shao said: "Come! I will tell you. Heaven has the Six Ultimates and Five Constants. If emperors and kings follow them, there is order; if they oppose them, there is misfortune. The affairs of the Nine Rivers, when governed to completion and virtue perfected, illuminate the earth below. When the world upholds them, this is called the Supreme August."

**[1] Annotation:**
Though the proximate causes of things may be known, tracing their origins to the ultimate reveals no cause—things simply are as they are.

Thus, being as they are, there is no need to inquire further into their causes—one should simply follow them.

**Commentary:**
Wu Xian was a divine shaman and minister to King Zhongzong of the Shang. *Shao* was his name. The Six Ultimates refer to the six directions: the four cardinal points, above, and below. The Five Constants refer to the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—which are the inherent natures of human relations. This speaks of the natural principle: there are these Six Ultimates and Five Constants, and even the movements of the sun, moon, wind, and clouds follow the same pattern. One should simply allow them to unfold naturally, for they are complete in themselves—why impose intentions upon them?

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Wu Xian Shao*: *Chi* is read as *yao* in the *fanqie* system; Guo [Pu] reads it as *tiao*, or alternatively as *shao*. Li [Yi] says: Wu Xian was a minister of the Shang. *Shao* is a posthumous name.
*Wu yu*: *Yu* is read as *ju* in the *fanqie* system.
*Nu*: Read as *ru*; the same applies thereafter.
*Liu ji*: Sima [Biao] says: the four directions, above, and below.
◎ Yu Yue says: The Six Ultimates and Five Constants may well be the Five Fortunes and Six Calamities from the *Hongfan*. *Chang* ("constant") and *xiang* ("auspicious") were interchangeable in ancient script. In the *Yili* ("Ceremonies and Rites"), *Shi Sang Li*, it says: "Offer these *chang* matters," and Zheng Xuan’s commentary notes: "In ancient script, *chang* was written as *xiang*." This is evidence. The *Shuowen*’s *shi* section states: *Xiang* means "fortune." Thus, the Five Constants are the Five Fortunes. The text below says: "The affairs of the Nine Rivers, when governed to completion and virtue perfected"—this likely refers to the Nine Categories of the *Luoshu* that Yu received!

**[2] Annotation:**
While acquired learning may be altered, one’s Heaven-endowed nature cannot be opposed.

**Commentary:**
The emperors and kings align above with the Dao of Heaven and follow below the will of the people. Governing with effortless action and allowing things to take their course brings order to the world. But to defy the joy of all under Heaven and disrupt the harmonious *qi* of the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) is to act perversely, inviting chaos and misfortune.

**[3] Commentary:**
The "affairs of the Nine Rivers" refer to the matters of the Nine Provinces’ settlements. This means that when a ruler responds to Heaven and follows the natural course of things, governing without preconceived intent, the world attains great peace, and the people sing and play *jiqiang*. The lands of the Nine Provinces’ settlements achieve order and completion; the distant barbarian states of the Eight Wastelands perfect their Dao and virtue. Aligning with the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth), they nurture and sustain the myriad things; uniting with the Three Luminaries (sun, moon, and stars), they illuminate the earth below.
◎ Jia Shifu says: This speaks of Heaven’s movements as being spontaneous. When emperors and kings follow this spontaneity and respond with the Dao, Heaven and Earth also receive their shaping influence, and wind and rain are harmonized, the four seasons ordered. The "affairs of the Nine Rivers" are the Nine Categories that Yu received. *Zhuangzi* speaks of the Dao as not deviating from the sages—this is an example of that.

**[4] Annotation:**
This is because they follow what is spontaneously so.

**Commentary:**
When the Dao aligns with spontaneity and virtue equals the transformations of creation, the people willingly uphold it without weariness, and the common folk bear its burden without complaint. This may be called a return to simplicity and the governance of the Supreme August.
The Grand Steward of Song asked Zhuangzi about *ren* (benevolence).
Zhuangzi replied: "Tigers and wolves possess *ren*."
**[1] Commentary:**
The state of Song succeeded the Shang, so "Shang" here refers to Song.

The Grand Steward was an official title; his given name was Ying, and his courtesy name was Dang. Desiring to resolve his doubts, he questioned Zhuangzi about *ren* (benevolence).

**[Textual Note:]**
*Shang da* is read as *Tai*; the same applies to *da xi* below.
*Zai Dang*: Sima Biao states: "Shang refers to Song; *da zai* is the official title; *Dang* is the courtesy name."

**[2] Commentary:**
*Ren* is the manifestation of affection and love. Even fierce beasts like tigers and wolves understand mutual affection, which clearly shows that all beings possess the nature of *ren*.

The Grand Steward asked: "What do you mean by this?"

**[1] Commentary:**
The Grand Steward, not yet grasping the profound meaning, pressed further to inquire what was intended.

Zhuangzi replied: "The affection between father and son—how is this not *ren*?"

**[1] Commentary:**
The love between father and son arises naturally from Heaven; this is true *ren*—why ask again?

The Grand Steward said: "May I ask about perfect *ren*?"

**[1] Commentary:**
The affection of tigers and wolves is limited in scope, so he sought perfect *ren*, hoping to hear its profound principle.

Zhuangzi said: "Perfect *ren* is without partiality."

**[1] Annotation:**
"Without partiality" does not imply a deficiency of virtue. Consider the human body: there is no partiality in its parts. The head naturally resides above, the feet below; the organs dwell within, the skin and hair without. Within the body, outer and inner, above and below, noble and base, each fulfills its utmost function—yet there is no partial affection among them. This is the sufficiency of perfect *ren*. Thus, the five relations and six kinships, the worthy and foolish, near and far, do not lose their proper place in the world. This is the principle of spontaneity—what need is there for partiality?

**[Commentary:]**
Perfect *ren* forgets cares and severs thoughts, uniting with the Great Void as one body, merging the myriad things into singularity. How could partiality or impartiality be discussed? It is utterly without intent, yet accords with the world’s partialities.

**[Textual Note:]**
*Fu zang* is read as *cai lang*.

The Grand Steward said: "I have heard that without partiality, there is no love; without love, there is no filial piety. To call perfect *ren* unfilial—is this acceptable?"

**[1] Commentary:**
Without love or partiality, this is unfilial. To say perfect *ren* is unfilial—does this accord with principle? Shang Dang, failing to grasp the profound meaning, thus fell into shallow confusion. Zhuangzi, for his sake, provided a clear refutation, as elaborated below.

**[Textual Note:]**
In one version, *Dang* is written as *Ying*; the Cui edition follows this. Some say *Ying* is the Grand Steward’s courtesy name.

Zhuangzi said: "Not so. Perfect *ren* is lofty indeed; filial piety is simply insufficient to describe it.

**[1] Annotation:**
It must be spoken of in terms of forgetting *ren* and forgetting filial piety before it can be considered perfect.

**[Commentary:]**
Perfect *ren* forgets rightness and *ren*, esteemed and noble—how could one speak of it in terms of love and respect, mere proximate traces? It is fundamentally insufficient to describe.

**[2] Annotation:**
All names arise from insufficiency. Thus, transcending the names of *ren* and filial piety to enter the realm of namelessness—only then is perfection attained.

**[Commentary:]**
Shang Dang’s question remained mired in conventional bounds, while Zhuangzi’s answer soared beyond all limits. Thus, the principle of affection and love is not an excess of filial piety but a discourse that does not even reach filial piety.

**[3] Annotation:**
Ming Mountain lies in the northernmost reaches; to observe it while traveling south is to see Ying yet grow ever more distant from Ming Mountain. Perfect *ren* resides in impartiality; to speak of it in terms of *ren* and love is to make it ever more distant from the ultimate principle.

**[Commentary:]**
Ying is located in the south, Ming Mountain in the north. As Master Guo notes: "Ming Mountain lies in the northernmost reaches; to observe it while traveling south is to see Ying yet grow ever more distant from Ming Mountain. Perfect *ren* resides in impartiality; to speak of it in terms of *ren* and love is to make it ever more distant from the ultimate Dao." This annotation is quite clear and requires no further explanation.

**[Textual Note:]**
*Ying*: read as *yi jing* or *yi zheng*; the capital of Chu, located north of Jiangling.
*Ming Mountain*: Sima Biao states it is a mountain in the Northern Sea. ◎Qing Fan’s note: The *Su Qin Liezhuan* in the *Shiji*, as cited in the *Suoyin*, refers to Ming Mountain as being north of Shuozhou, differing from the *Shiwen*.

Thus, it is said: "With reverence, filial piety is easy; with love, filial piety is difficult. With love, filial piety is easy; to forget one’s kin is difficult. To forget one’s kin is easy; to make one’s kin forget oneself is difficult. To make one’s kin forget oneself is easy; to forget the world is difficult. To forget the world is easy; to make the world forget oneself is difficult.

The virtue of Yao and Shun was abandoned, yet they did not act for its sake. Their beneficence extended to ten thousand generations, yet the world knew nothing of it. How could this be merely a great sigh over *ren* and filial piety?

Filial piety, brotherly respect, *ren*, rightness, loyalty, trust, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exertions that enslave one’s virtue. They are not worthy of esteem.

Thus, it is said: The most noble surpasses the state’s ranks; the most wealthy surpasses the state’s wealth; the greatest aspiration surpasses fame and reputation. Therefore, the Dao does not change."

【4】【Commentary】Respect lies in outward traces; love follows the original heart. The heart arises from Heaven’s nature, thus it is difficult; traces are bound to human sentiment, thus they are easy.

【5】【Commentary】Though love and filial piety are difficult, they still linger within the realm of attachment—how much less do they compare to forgetting one’s kin, which is serene and free from entanglement? Since forgetting surpasses love, there is superiority and inferiority; by this measure, the difficulty and ease are made clear.

【6】【Commentary】When gibbons leap and sever their bowels, when old oxen lick their calves, kindness flows downward—this is the constant nature of creatures. Thus, for a child to forget its parents is easy; for parents to forget their child is difficult. Without attaining the Dao, who could practice this?

【7】【Annotation】The utmost *ren* harmonizes every joint, so that one goes through the day without self-awareness. When the sage presides, it is not through deliberate action but by allowing each to find its own fulfillment. When each fulfills itself, all affairs naturally harmonize, all beings naturally suffice—how could the world fail to forget itself? When all have forgotten themselves, where does the ruler reside? This is what is called mutual forgetting.

【Commentary】To mutually forget the world is to cast aside the throne as one would a worn-out sandal. To make the world mutually forget oneself is to have the people act in daily life without awareness. To govern with folded arms at Fenyang while roaming in spirit to Guye, the beauty of yielding and deference—this lies in emptiness and forgetting, and is the mutual forgetting of the world. Compared to what precedes, it is difficult; compared to what follows, it is easy. Yet it does not equal forgetting the Dao and stilling wisdom to merge with the transformations of creation, uniting virtue with Heaven and Earth. Thus, one indulges the natural dispositions of the myriad things, follows the inclinations of the hundred clans, so that great and small all attain their due, flying and sinking none are lost. Beneficence flows unseen, and all things are as they are—above, like branches swaying in the wind; below, like deer in the wild. At such a time, where does the ruler reside? This is to make the world mutually forget oneself, akin to the sovereigns before Xuanyuan, the ancient lords of pristine simplicity. Their virtue was unseen, so the world forgot them. This is to move from inferior to superior, from coarse to subtle, to relinquish and relinquish again, to delve into mystery upon mystery.

【8】【Annotation】Only by relinquishing Yao and Shun does their virtue become complete; if it remains bound in the heart, it is not self-attainment.

【Commentary】To relinquish is to forget and abandon. Yao and Shun, those two sovereigns of profound and far-reaching virtue, also forgot their virtue and acted without contrivance. This explains why mutually forgetting the world is difficult.

【9】【Annotation】Ever at ease, ever harmonious.

【Commentary】Their beneficence and grace nourished the multitude of beings, and ten thousand generations later, their virtue endures. Yet their utmost virtue flows unseen, and in daily use, it goes unnoticed. This explains why making the world mutually forget oneself is difficult.

【10】【Annotation】Lost in rivers and lakes, one then longs for a moistening drop.

【Commentary】*Da xi* means to sigh deeply. If those whose virtue equals Yao and Shun can yet forget and refrain from self-display, how could they sigh over *ren* and filial piety or lament over mere traces?

【11】【Commentary】*Ti* means deference. *De* is true nature. These eight matters above—filial piety, brotherly respect, *ren*, rightness, loyalty, trust, integrity, and incorruptibility—are all contrived emotions that strain one’s nature, forced efforts that abandon the self to imitate others, laboring and enslaving one’s inherent power. Thus, they are not worthy of esteem.

【12】【Annotation】*Bing* means to cast aside. If what is noble lies in oneself, and one forgets even oneself, how much more so titles and ranks! This is the utmost nobility.

【Commentary】*Bing* means to cast aside. Those who value titles and ranks do so for the sake of the self. If one forgets even the self, how much more so titles and ranks! This is the utmost nobility.

【13】【Annotation】The utmost wealth lies in self-sufficiency alone; thus, one casts aside the riches of the world.

【Commentary】The utmost wealth belongs to those who know contentment. For one who knows contentment, non-greed is their treasure—even if the wealth of a kingdom were poured before them, they would cast it aside and make no use of it. Thus, the *Laozi* says, "One who knows contentment is rich." This is what is meant here.

【14】【Annotation】The ultimate fulfillment is attunement; when attunement is attained, the names of *ren* and filial piety all depart.

【Commentary】The ultimate fulfillment is nothing other than attunement to one’s nature. Once one levels praise and blame, merges honor and disgrace, forgets self and other, and dissolves right and wrong, then fame and reputation are seen as mere spittle.

【15】【Annotation】This is because one discards the ornamental and takes the real.

【Commentary】*Yu* means change or diminution. Having forgotten wealth and rank and relinquished fame and reputation, one’s virtue and power become pure and thick, no longer shifting with external things.

【Textual Note】*Qu hua* ("discard the ornamental") is read as *qǐ lǚ* in the *Shiwen*.

【Collation】The *Shide Tang* edition has *yi* ("already") where the received text has *ěr* ("ear").

Beimen Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor, saying: "When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of *Dongting*, at first I heard it and was afraid; upon hearing it again, I grew weary; and when I heard it to the end, I was bewildered. Vacant and silent, I could no longer find myself."

【1】【Commentary】Beimen was his surname, Cheng his given name—he was a minister of the Yellow Emperor. To clarify the Dao of utmost joy, the text introduces these two figures to set forth the exchange. *Xianchi* is the name of the music. *Zhang* means to perform. *Xian* means harmony. *Dongting* refers to the space between Heaven and Earth, not the Dongting Lake of Taihu.

【Textual Note】*Beimen Cheng* is a personal name. *Dongting* is read as *tú sòng*.

【2】【Commentary】*Dai* means to recede. *Zu* means to end. *Fu* means again. *Huo* means darkness. Not yet awakened to the utmost joy, at first hearing, he was startled and fearful; upon hearing the sound a second time, he gradually grasped its purport, and thus his fear receded; when he heard it to the end, he understood that the utmost joy harmonizes with the virtue of the Two Modes, seen but not visible, heard but not audible—thus his mind, devoid of distinctions, became like one in darkness.

【Textual Note】*Zhi ju* is read as written, or as *jù* (alternate pronunciation below). One edition has *jué*, read as *kuàng fù*. According to the *Shuowen*, *ju* is the standard character, *jué* the ancient form. ◎Lu Wenchang notes: The *Shuowen* has *sǒng* as the ancient form of *ju*, and *sǒng* (same as *sǒng*, "to tower") is not a variant of *ju*. There is no *jué* character in the text. It is unclear what edition Master Lu consulted. *Fu wen* is read as *fú yòu*.

【3】【Annotation】"Could no longer find myself" refers to *zuowang* (sitting in forgetfulness).

【Commentary】*Dangdang* describes an even and unobstructed bearing. *Momo* depicts a state of unknowing. Upon the third hearing, he embodied and awakened to the mysterious principle—thus he was *dangdang* without bias, *momo* without knowledge, and in a state of *zuowang*, where self and other were both lost, he could no longer find himself.

The Emperor said: "You were nearly correct! I performed it with human affairs, verified it with Heaven, enacted it with ritual propriety, and established it with Great Purity.

【1】【Annotation】From this we know that the utmost joy is not a matter of sounds and tones. It must first accord with Heaven, respond to humanity, be realized in the heart and attuned to one’s nature, and only then be expressed in sound and performed in melody. Thus, the music of *Xianchi* could only be completed after the transformation wrought by the Yellow Emperor.

【Commentary】*Dai* means "nearly." *Zou* means "to respond."

The utmost joy first responds to human affairs, follows the patterns of Heaven, is enacted through the Five Virtues, and corresponds to spontaneity. Only then does it harmonize the four seasons and bring the myriad things to perfect harmony.

The four seasons arise in succession, the myriad things follow their birth; now flourishing, now declining, the warp of civil and martial order unfolds. Now clear, now turbid, yin and yang harmonize, and their radiance flows forth in sound.

Hibernating creatures begin to stir, and I startle them with thunder. Its end has no tail, its beginning no head. Now dying, now living; now collapsing, now rising. Its constancy is inexhaustible, yet it cannot be awaited. This is why you were afraid."

"‘*Hui*’ means ‘to accord.’ Ritual and righteousness are the Five Virtues. The Great Purity is the Dao of Heaven. After the Yellow Emperor truly heard the third movement of *Beimen Cheng*, he embodied and awakened to the mysterious Dao, forgetting knowledge and stilling thoughts. Thus, I approved of his understanding, saying, ‘You nearly accord with spontaneity.’"

Though one may follow the traces of ritual and righteousness, one forgets the root of spontaneity. This is the first movement.

"To follow is to accord; *lun* is principle; *jing* is constancy. The four seasons arise in succession, and all things follow their ordered birth. Summer flourishes, winter declines; spring is civil, autumn martial—the principles of generation and destruction are the constancy of Heaven’s Dao. Simply abiding by this is the utmost joy."

Spontaneity’s pitch-pipes fill the space between Heaven and Earth. One must only accord without seizing, and the utmost joy is complete.

"Purity is Heaven; turbidity is Earth. Yin ascends, yang descends, and the two qi harmonize. Thus, the myriad things are born, harmonious qi flows forth, and the Three Luminaries illuminate all—this is the utmost joy, the soundless sound."

I further attuned it to the harmony of yin and yang, illumined it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sound could be short or long, soft or firm; its transformations uniform, unbound by fixed norms. In valleys, it filled valleys; in hollows, it filled hollows. It sealed off and guarded the spirit, taking things as its measure. Its sound soared and resounded, its name lofty and luminous. Thus, ghosts and spirits guarded their hidden realms, while sun, moon, and stars followed their courses. I halted it at the bounded, flowed it into the boundless. I wished to ponder it but could not know it, to gaze upon it but could not see it, to pursue it but could not reach it. Suddenly, I stood on the Way of the fourfold void, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting. My eyes’ knowledge was exhausted by what they longed to see, my strength spent by what they longed to pursue—I could not attain it! My form filled the emptiness, even to the point of meandering. You meandered, and thus grew weary."

The Way that pervades all living things shines with a brilliance equal to the sun and moon. This is the second performance.

It unifies all in transformation, thus not clinging to fixed constancy.

It follows the long and short of all beings, accords with the soft and hard of the myriad things, and equalizes the principle of change—how could it guard the old and grasp the constant!

The Way of perfect joy leaves nothing untouched.

The Way of perfect joy pervades all without exception, filling valleys and hollows alike. This is what is meant by "the Dao is nowhere absent, yet wherever it is, there is nothing."

Seal off its apertures.

Close the gates of the heart’s knowing, guard the spirit in its serene stillness.

Great regulation does not sever.

In great and small, long and short, it follows the measure of things, never imposing its own divisions.

This is called "unfolding harmony."

It moves like thunder’s quaking, its sound vast and expansive.

Its name matches its reality, thus it is lofty and luminous.

High as the heavens above, bright as the sun and moon, its sound vast and great, its name likewise lofty and luminous.

It does not depart from its place.

Beings dwell in their brightness, ghosts and spirits guard their hidden realms—each attains its proper place without disturbance. Thus the *Laozi* says: "When the Dao benefits all under heaven, ghosts do not act as spirits."

It does not lose its measure.

The Three Luminaries shine forth, following their allotted paths; the net of the highest mystery is never in error.

It ever abides at the utmost.

Though it undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, it ever dwells at the mysterious summit, never departing from the wondrous root—active yet ever still.

It flows in response to change.

It moves with the ceaseless flux, adapting to each moment without clinging, thus still yet ever in motion.

Thus it darkly lets transformations proceed.

The perfect joy is the true Dao. To clarify that the Dao is not an object of the heart’s knowing, one may ponder it yet never know it; the Dao is not sound or form, thus one may gaze upon it yet never see it; the Dao is not material shape, thus one may pursue it yet never reach it.

This is called "vast and open without partiality."

Suddenly, one stands on the Way of the fourfold void.

Vast and open, impartial in its embrace, the sage, free of self, becomes one with perfect joy. With a mind as boundless as the Dao, they meet all things without bias, encompassing the ten thousand beings and uniting in virtue with the empty void.

Exhausted is the eye’s knowing by what it longs to see, spent the strength by what it longs to pursue—I could not attain it!

The knowing and strength of things each have their limits. The eye’s knowing has its bounds, thus it is exhausted; the strength’s pursuit has its measure, thus it is spent. Perfect joy is not a matter of heart or form, and cannot be bounded by limits. Thus I knew my efforts were in vain and ceased my pursuit. The heart, being limited, knows only its love for the nameless. This repeats the earlier passage on "I wished to ponder it..."

The body fills the empty void, becoming formless—formless, thus it can be supple and yielding. Supple and yielding, following nature, the emotions of dread and fear fade away.

The body fills the void, thus equaling the void in measure; supple and yielding, following nature, it accords with the ten thousand things without attachment—this is what is meant by "dissolving the body, dulling the senses, departing from form, and forsaking knowledge." Only by being supple and yielding, following nature, do the emotions of dread and fear cease. This explains the second hearing of the music.

I then played for him music without weariness, attuned to the mandate of nature. Thus it seemed to blend and surge forth in clusters, a forest of music yet without form; it spread and waved without trailing, deep and obscure yet without sound. It moved without fixed direction, abided in profound darkness. Some called it death, some called it life; some called it substance, some called it glory. Flowing and scattering, shifting without end, it did not adhere to any constant sound. The world doubted it and turned to the sage for inquiry.

The sage is one who penetrates to the truth of things and fulfills the mandate of nature. The celestial mechanism is not set in motion, yet the five senses are all complete—this is called the music of heaven, which speaks no words yet delights the heart. Thus the Divine Flame Clan composed this ode:

*"Hear it yet hear no sound,
See it yet see no form,
Filling heaven and earth,
Enveloping the six directions."*

You wish to hear it yet find no point of contact—thus you remain perplexed.

The mind, already weary, is met with music without weariness—this is its perfection.

Having heard the perfect music, yielding and following nature, the heart’s dread and fear fade away. Though this surpasses the first hearing, it still falls short of what comes after. Thus the music without weariness is played—dispelling weariness with the absence of weariness. As Guo’s commentary states: "The mind, already weary, is met with the absence of weariness—this is its perfection." This is the third playing.

The mandate inherent in all things is not a matter of human artifice—it is all natural. To attune is to harmonize. All living beings take nature as their mandate. Thus, in playing this music of the Pool of Harmony, one seeks to harmonize the spirit of creation and attune to the natural mandate of all things.

Blending without attachment, it arises with the clusters. It moves as one with the stirring of the wind, rising with the sounds of the forest groves.

The perfect music is simply fitting—fitting within the body, thus it has no separate form.

The sounds of the forest groves and the earth’s pipes arise without intention, forming perfect music that merely accords with nature—how could it have form?

It spreads of itself. It stirs the four seasons, disperses the ten thousand things, each finding its place—not by force or trailing.

This is the so-called perfect music. The perfect music is tranquil and transcends sight and sound, thus it is deep, obscure, and silent.

Master Jia Shifu says: *"The* Shuowen *defines clustered trees as a forest. 'Forest of music' means to rejoice together in a multitude. The five notes intermingle, and one cannot discern from whence the sounds arise—thus it is said to be without form. To 'spread and wave' is to shake and raise, like cloth unfurling without end, yet there is no one to trail it. 'Forest of music without form'—its sounds converge; 'spreading and waving without trailing'—its sounds linger; 'deep and obscure without sound'—its sounds are subtle."*

Does that which moves require a fixed direction before it moves?

Though the root of perfect music is soundless, its responses move with the times, truly without fixed direction—this is stillness in motion.

This is the so-called "tranquil extremity." Though it responds to things and adapts to circumstances, transforming endlessly, its deep root remains in tranquil extremity, ever abiding in profound darkness—this is motion in stillness.

It changes with the transformations of things. Spring gives birth, winter brings death; autumn bears fruit, summer flourishes. Clouds move, rain scatters; water flows, winds follow—the principle of nature renews itself daily in change. How could the Way of perfect music adhere to a constant sound?

The world doubts it and turns to the sage for inquiry. The sage, like the echo in a deep valley or the reflection in a bright mirror, responds to things without knowing whence they come, ceases with them without knowing whither they go. Things come, and the sage responds, responding yet forgetting all—how could they preemptively devise methods or fix their minds on responding to the world? Thus, flowing and scattering, shifting without end, not adhering to any constant sound, the world’s people are deluded and perplexed.

The sage is one who penetrates to the truth of things and fulfills the mandate of nature—thus all beings, with their truths and mandates, depend on them.

The virtue of forgetting joy is itself joy’s fulfillment—it is not prepared through deliberate effort.

The celestial mechanism is the pivot of nature. The five officials are the five viscera. Each of the five viscera has its governing office, hence they are called "officials." The eye sees, the ear hears, the hand grasps, the foot walks—spreading nets, rolling pellets, flying through the sky, running on the earth—none of this arises from imitation, but is endowed by the Creator. How could one need to apply the mind before being able to act! Thus, the offices of the five viscera are inherently complete, and the beauty of celestial joy lies precisely here.

Joy resides in harmony, not in words.

Embodying this celestial harmony does not depend on deliberate effort, so the spirit finds delight in a subtlety beyond all description.

This is joy without joy—the ultimate joy.

Yan Shi (Shennong) praised this supreme joy in his hymns. The great sound is soundless, so it cannot be heard when listened for; the great image is formless, so it cannot be seen when looked for. The Dao is present everywhere, filling heaven and earth; the great encompasses all, embracing the six directions. The six directions are the six directions of space. Even if one were to strain to listen, it cannot be grasped by the ear—thus, embodying this supreme joy, its principle is profound and subtle. The mind makes no distinctions, and the matter appears as foolish confusion.

The *Baoguo* is pronounced *bao*. Some versions write it as *bao*.

Joy begins with fear—fear gives rise to misfortune.
Next comes indolence—indolence leads to retreat.
Finally, there is confusion—confusion results in foolishness.
Foolishness gives way to the Dao, which can be borne and journeyed with as one.

**Annotations:**
Fearful listening breeds misfortune, for it is not yet great harmony.
**Commentary:** Below, the meaning of the three performances and three hearings is further expounded, culminating in the Dao of supreme joy. At first, upon hearing the supreme joy, one fails to grasp the great harmony, and the heart is filled with dread, unable to let go—thus inviting misfortune.

**Annotations:**
Retreat marks the fading of traces.
**Commentary:** After hearing it again, the mind begins to awaken, and the fear recedes into indolence, its traces vanishing.

**Annotations:**
Foolishness is ignorance taken to its limit.
**Commentary:** Upon hearing it at last, the spirit becomes pure and harmonious, the heart free of distinctions, akin to darkness and confusion—vast and silent, like one lost in stupidity. Neither indolent nor fearful, it aligns with the true Dao, carried effortlessly and arriving with all things.

Confucius traveled west to Wei. Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, “What do you make of the Master’s conduct?”

From Lu to Wei is westward, hence called a "western journey." Shi Jin was the Grand Music Master of Lu, named Jin. *Xī* means "what." He asks whether the Master’s practice of the Way of benevolence and righteousness to transform the Lord of Wei will succeed or not.

**Shi Jin said, "Alas! Your Master will meet with misfortune!"**

**Annotations:**
The Master, wise and discerning, is a pity—clinging to the sagely traces of former kings and upholding the ancient Way of Yao and Shun, he repeatedly endures hardship and meets with adversity.

**Yan Yuan said, "Why?"**

**Annotations:**
He asks why he will meet with misfortune.

**Shi Jin said, "Before the straw dog is set out, it is stored in a bamboo box, wrapped in an embroidered cloth, and the invocator fasts and purifies himself to present it. Once it has been set out, passersby trample its head and spine, and gatherers take it to burn for fuel. If one were to take it again, store it in a bamboo box, wrap it in an embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath it, even if one did not dream, one would surely suffer from dust in the eyes. Now your Master has taken the already-used straw dogs of former kings, gathered his disciples to wander and rest beneath them. Thus he was barred from felling trees in Song, erased his traces in Wei, met with hardship in Shang and Zhou—was this not like a dream? Besieged between Chen and Cai, seven days without cooked food, life and death as close as neighbors—was this not like dust in the eyes?**

**Annotations:**
The following six analogies are given: first, the straw dog; second, the boat and cart; third, the well-sweep; fourth, the wild pear and plum; fifth, the ape; sixth, beauty and ugliness.
The *chúgǒu* is made of grass, fashioned into a dog for exorcism. *Yǎn* is a bamboo container. The *shīzhù* are shamans. *Jiāng* means "to send off." Before the straw dog is set out, it is stored in a bamboo container, covered with an embroidered cloth, and purified with fasting to show sincerity. It is sent off as if it were present, in hopes of blessing—so highly is it valued.

The *qiè* is pronounced *kǔ dié* (苦牒); some versions write it as *kuāng* (筐). The *yǎn* is pronounced *yán shàn* (延善), or *guō yí* (郭怡) in Guo’s reading. Li says: "A bamboo container, the vessel for holding the straw dog." Sima says: "To join together." ◎Qing Fan notes: The character *jīn* (巾, cloth) is likely a scribal error for *shì* (饰, adornment). The *Taiping Yulan* quotes the *Huainanzi*: "Wrapped in patterned silk as adornment."

**Second Section**
**Annotation:** When discarded things are of no further use, they invite other misfortunes.
**Exegesis:** *Jiàn* means to tread. *Shǒu* is the head. *Jǐ* is the back. *Sū* refers to gathering grass. *Cuàn* means to cook. *Mī* means to be haunted. Before the straw dog is set out, it is treated with solemn reverence. After the ritual, it is cast aside on the road, where passersby trample its head and back, and gatherers take it for kindling. Yet when it is once more esteemed, placed in a bamboo container, covered with embroidered cloth, carried in processions, or kept by one’s side for sleep—even if it does not bring nightmares, it will surely cause repeated hauntings. Thus Guo’s annotation states: "When discarded things are of no further use, they invite other misfortunes."

**Philological Notes:**
*Sū zhě*: Li says: "Sū means grass; those who gather grass use it for cooking." The *Fangyan* states: "In the regions of Jiang, Huai, and southern Chu, it is called *sū*." The *Records of the Grand Historian* says: "They gathered firewood and grass for cooking," with the note: "Sū means to gather grass."
*Cuàn zhī*: Pronounced *qī wán* (七丸).
*Jiāng fù*: Pronounced *fú yòu* (扶又).
*Bì qiě*: Read as written, or *xú* (徐) reads it as *zǐ yú* (子余).
*Shuò*: Pronounced *shuò* (朔).
*Mī*: Li pronounces it *mǐ* (米), or *měi* (美). The *Zilin* says: "An ailment caused by something entering the eye." Sima says: "To be oppressed," pronounced *yì yǎn* (一琰).

**Third Section**
**Exegesis:** This analogy of the straw dog corresponds to Confucius’ hardships. The former kings—Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang—were the ancient sovereigns. Following the models of Wen and Wu, they took Yao and Shun as their ancestors and established teachings. Thus they gathered disciples, roamed in the realm of benevolence and righteousness, and rested in the land of ritual and trust. Yet the ancient ways cannot be clung to; the matter is like the already-used straw dog. The incident of felling the tree in Song: Confucius once traveled to Song, where he discoursed with his disciples beneath a great tree. Sima Huan Tui sought to kill the Master, and after Confucius departed, Huan Tui, resenting the place where he had sat, had the tree cut down. *Xuē* means to erase. The Master also traveled to Wei, where the people despised him and thus erased his traces, leaving him without employment. Shang was the land of Yin, and Zhou was the Eastern Zhou; Confucius journeyed through both and was once besieged there. All this suffering arose from clinging to sagely traces. Such distress—was it not like a nightmare?

◎ Yu Yue states: The first *qu* (取) is to be read as its usual sense, while the second *qu* should be read as *ju* (聚). The *Cui* Hexagram’s *Xiang Zhuan* in the *Zhouyi* says, “Gathering (*ju*) is through rectitude,” and the *Shiwen* notes: “*Ju* is written as *qu* in Xun’s version.” The *Book of Han’s* “Treatise on the Five Phases” reads, “Internally *qu* (*ju*) this,” and Yan Shigu comments: “*Qu* is to be read as *ju* in the *Liji*’s ‘Gathering the Doe.’” Thus, *ju* and *qu* were interchangeable in antiquity.

【Four】【Annotation】This all conveys the meaning of “cutting off sageliness and discarding knowledge,” with no room for hesitation. The rites of the former kings were meant to suit their times. When the time has passed and they are not abandoned, they become portents for the people, giving rise to the beginnings of forced imitation.

【Exegesis】At that time, King Zhao of Chu invited the Master, who led his disciples to lodge in the lands of Chen and Cai. The people of Cai, seeing the great number of followers, took them for bandits and thus raised troops to besiege them. For seven days, their provisions were exhausted, no cooking fires could be lit, and the disciples, starving and ill, could not rise. Distressed and sorrowful, they were nearly brought to death—was this not suffering from clinging to the already-used straw dog, as if trapped in a nightmare?

The best way to travel on water is by boat, and the best way to travel on land is by cart. If, because a boat can traverse water, one seeks to push it on land, then even after a lifetime it will not advance a few feet. 【One】Is not the distinction between past and present like that between water and land? Are not Zhou and Lu like boat and cart? Now, to seek to implement Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—【Two】laborious yet fruitless, and one will surely bring calamity upon oneself. They did not understand the transmission of the boundless Dao, which responds to things without exhaustion. 【Three】

【One】【Exegesis】A boat travels on water, a cart on land; even a thousand *li* is not difficult. But if one pushes a boat on land, seeking to transport goods, then even after a lifetime it will not advance a few feet.

【Textual Note】*Tuī zhī* (推之): Guo reads *tu* as *tui* (吐回反), also as the usual pronunciation. The same applies below.

【Two】【Exegesis】This is a metaphor. *Qí* means “to seek.” The past and present differ—is this not like the distinction between water and land? Zhou and Lu are different lands—how are they not like boat and cart?

【Textual Note】*Lù yǔ* (陆与): Pronounced *yú* (余). The same applies below.

《今蕲》: Pronounced *qí*, meaning "to seek."

【Three】【Commentary】As times change and generations differ, rites must also adapt. Thus, one should respond to things without attachment—this is how effort yields success.

【Exegesis】*Fāng* means "constant." *Zhuàn* means "to turn." Confucius clung to the traces of the former kings while living in the declining Zhou era, exhausting his mind and strength to no avail. Thus, he was stripped of his position and his tree felled, bringing misfortune upon himself. The wisdom of the sage is boundless, turning and transforming in endless ways to respond to the moment. Not understanding this Dao, he suffered such calamity.

【Textual Note】*Wú fāng zhī zhuàn*: Pronounced *zhí zhuān* (直专反), with the same pronunciation in the commentary below. Sima [Qian] says: *fāng* means "constant." ◎Qingfan’s note: *Zhuàn* should be read as *zhuǎn* (转), meaning "unrestrained turning." *Lǚ shì chūn qiū* ("The Annals of Lü Buwei"), *Bì jǐ* chapter: "As for the nature of the myriad things and the transmission of human relations," Gao’s commentary: *zhuàn* means "to turn." *Hàn shū* ("Book of Han"), *Liú Xiàng zhuàn*: "Yu, Qi, and Gao Yao mutually drew upon one another," meaning they turned to one another for support. *Huái nán zǐ*, *Zhǔ shù* chapter: "In life, one lacks nothing; in death, the corpse does not turn," while the *Yì Zhōu shū*, *Dà jù* chapter writes it as *zhuàn shī* (传尸). *Zuǒ zhuàn* commentary on the 25th year of Duke Xiang: "A copying error," with the *Shì wén* noting: *zhuàn* is written as *zhuǎn* in another version.

Have you not seen the well-sweep? When pulled, it bows; when released, it rises. It is drawn by others, not drawing others—thus, it bows and rises without offending anyone.

【One】Therefore, the rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for uniformity but for their efficacy in governance.

【Two】【Commentary】The aim is to suit the times and respond to the needs of governance.

【Exegesis】*Jīn* means "to prize." The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors lived in different eras, and their rites, music, and ceremonies were not passed down unchanged. Their excellence lay in adapting to the moment, not in rigid adherence. They did not value blindly following the present to match the past.

【Textual Note】*Yú zhì*: Pronounced *zhí* (直吏反), with the same pronunciation in the commentary.

【Three】【Exegesis】The crabapple, pear, orange, and pomelo differ in taste, yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Likewise, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors governed in eras of varying simplicity and decadence, yet all adapted to the needs of their time.

【Textual Note】*Zhā*: Pronounced *cè jiā* (侧加反). *Yòu*: Pronounced *yóu jiù* (由救反).

Thus, rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions are things that change with the times.

【One】【Commentary】What one deems beautiful, another may deem ugly. Therefore, they must adapt to the times to be universally fitting.

【Exegesis】The standards of the sage-kings are not fixed. They change with the times and cannot be rigidly adhered to. How can one cling to the past while living in the present, like tuning a zither with fixed pegs or carving a mark on a moving boat?

【Two】【Exegesis】*Qiè* means "satisfied." The Duke of Zhou represents a sage of a pure and ancient era, while the cunning ape symbolizes a decadent and competitive age.

If you take an ape and dress it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it will gnaw, tear, and rip them off until they are completely removed and it is satisfied. The difference between past and present is like the difference between an ape and the Duke of Zhou.

【Three】When Xishi clutched her chest in pain, the ugly women of her village saw her and admired her. They returned home and also clutched their chests in imitation. The rich people of the village, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and refused to go out, while the poor people took their wives and children and fled.

【Four】They knew that clutching the chest was beautiful but did not understand *why* it was beautiful.

【Five】Alas, how unfortunate that the Master met with such misfortune!

Thus, though ritual robes may be resplendent, apes and monkeys do not deem them beautiful; though the sagely legacy be noble, later ages do not hold it in esteem. Only when ritual robes are cast aside do apes and monkeys find contentment in their hearts; only when the sagely legacy is abandoned do the common people at last suit their nature.

---

【Three】Xishi was a beauty of Yue, her appearance surpassing in loveliness. When stricken with heart pain, she knit her brows in distress. Yet those of refined bearing, their forms naturally graceful, only grew more radiant in their frowns. Thus, when the women of her village saw her, they cherished her all the more. The ugly women of the neighborhood, seeing this, imitated her, forcing frowns though they were not ill, only doubling their ugliness. Therefore, the wealthy shut their doors and refused to emerge, while the poor took their wives and children and fled. To forsake one’s own nature and mimic others—such is the pattern of this folly. The felling of trees and erasure of footprints are all errors born of imitating a frown.

---

【Four】Moreover, with rites and rightness: when applied in their proper time, they are like Xishi; when clung to past their time, they become like the ugly women.

The reason her frown was beautiful lay in Xishi’s innate loveliness. Those ugly women, however, admired only the elegance of the frown, not understanding it arose from Xishi’s natural beauty.

【Five】In summary of what follows, this passage completes its meaning. The circumstances of the Master’s misfortune are fully set forth in this chapter.

【Collation】(1) The Zhao Advisor’s edition omits "Moreover" and the two instances of "then."

At fifty-one years of age, Confucius had yet to hear the Dao, so he journeyed south to Pei to visit Lao Dan. (1)
(1) *Subcommentary*: Though Confucius led three thousand disciples and was called the Uncrowned King, his cultivation of the Five Virtues had not yet granted him knowledge of the Great Dao. Thus, he traveled from Lu to Pei, journeying from north to south to meet the Old Master and inquire into the profound mysteries.

*Exegesis*: "To Pei" is pronounced *bei*. Sima [Qian] states: Laozi was a minister of the state of Chen. Chen corresponds to present-day Ku County, which borders Pei.

Lao Dan said: "Have you come? I have heard of you—you are a worthy man of the north. Have you attained the Dao?"
Confucius replied: "I have not."
(1) *Subcommentary*: [Laozi] had heard that Confucius was a worthy of the age but did not know whether he had grasped the ultimate Dao. Confucius answered that he had not. Since he gazed from Chu toward Lu, [Laozi] called him a northerner.

Lao Dan said: "How have you sought it?" (1)
(1) *Subcommentary*: He asked, "Where have you sought the ultimate Dao?"

*Exegesis*: "How" is pronounced *wu*; same below.

Confucius said: "I sought it in measures and calculations, but after five years I had not attained it." (1)
(1) *Subcommentary*: *Calculations* refers to arithmetic. A intercalary month every three years completes the lesser cycle of the celestial Dao; five years with two intercalary months completes the greater cycle. Thus, he spoke of five years. The Dao is not a matter of calculations, so he did not attain it.

Lao Dan said: "How else have you sought it?" (1)
(1) *Subcommentary*: He further asked, "What method have you used to seek the Dao?"

Confucius said: "I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I had not attained it." (1)
(1) *Commentary*: This is all an allegory by which [Zhuangzi] uses Confucius and Laozi to illustrate the meaning of lost learning.
*Subcommentary*: Twelve years constitute one full cycle of yin and yang. That he had not attained it shows that while the Dao may be approached through yin and yang, it is not itself yin and yang. Thus, the text below states: "There is a man in the Central Kingdom who is neither yin nor yang."

Lao Dan said: "Indeed. If the Dao could be presented as an offering, none would fail to offer it to their lord. If the Dao could be advanced, none would fail to advance it to their kin. If the Dao could be told to others, none would fail to tell it to their brothers. If the Dao could be given to others, none would fail to give it to their descendants. Yet it cannot be so—there is no other reason: (1) if there is no host within, it does not abide; (2) if there is no rectitude without, it does not proceed. (3) What issues from within is not received from without—thus the sage does not emerge. (4) What enters from without finds no host within—thus the sage does not conceal. (5) Fame is a public instrument—it cannot be taken in excess. (6) Benevolence and righteousness are the travelers’ lodges of the former kings—(7) one may stay a single night but cannot dwell there long; (8) to encounter them is to incur many reproaches.

(1) *Subcommentary*: The ultimate Dao is profoundly mysterious, transcending speech and form, neither existent nor non-existent, neither self nor other. Thus, it cannot be advanced to lord or kin, nor can it be told to siblings or disciples. The reason lies in nothing else: it is an allegory using the two sages, Confucius and Laozi, to clarify the mystery within the mystery.

(2) *Commentary*: If the heart lacks the capacity to receive the Dao, even hearing it will cause it to pass by.

(3) *Commentary*: Without a host within, external things also lack anything to rectify the self, and thus it never penetrates.
*Subcommentary*: Since there is no heart within to receive the Dao, there is also nothing without to rectify the self, and thus it cannot proceed.
◎ Yu Yue notes: *Rectitude* is a corruption of *match*. In the *Ziyi* chapter of the *Book of Rites*, "Only the gentleman can love his *match*," Zheng Xuan’s commentary states: "*Match* should be *rectitude*—a scribal error." This is a case in point. Here, it should read: "If there is no host within, it does not abide; if there is no match without, it does not proceed." This aligns with the *Gongyang Commentary* on Duke Xuan’s third year: "What issues from within has no match and does not proceed; what arrives from without has no host and does not abide." What arrives from without has no host and does not abide—thus this passage says, "If there is no host within, it does not abide." What issues from within has no match and does not proceed—thus this passage says, "If there is no match without, it does not proceed." Due to *match* being corrupted into *rectitude*, Guo’s commentary explains it as "rectifying the self," which is entirely mistaken. In the "Ze Yang" chapter, "What enters from without has a host and is not grasped; what issues from within has a match and is not resisted"—*match* should also be *rectitude*, the same error as here.

(4) *Commentary*: What issues from within is the Dao of the sage; it emerges only when there is one without capable of receiving it.
*Subcommentary*: *Issues from* means "comes forth from." What comes forth from within refers to the sage’s manifesting traces and teachings. Only when beings are moved by the sage does the sage respond and manifest. If external beings cannot receive it, the sage ultimately does not emerge to teach.

(5) *Commentary*: What enters from without is the cultivation of nature through learning. Though nature may be perfected through learning, it fundamentally requires an inner capacity. Without a host within, there is nothing to contain the sagely Dao.
*Subcommentary*: *Conceal* means "to store." What enters from without refers to the cultivation of nature through learning. Since it is received from without, it should reside in the heart. If there is no heart to receive it, the sagely Dao cannot be stored.
◎ Jia Shifu notes: "What issues from within is to follow one’s settled heart."

Those who learn by taking in from without absorb the words of a single master, delighting privately in their warmth and intimacy. If one follows their settled heart, then what comes from without cannot be received, and the sage cannot emerge to force them to accept it. If one learns the words of a single master and delights in them privately, then there is nothing within to serve as a host, and the sage cannot conceal himself in their heart to become their master.

*Commentary*: Names are what the world shares in common.
*Subcommentary*: *Name* means "to call out." *Public* means "impartial." *Vessel* means "use." There are two kinds of names: one is for designating things, the other for praise and blame. What is spoken of here is the name of praise and blame.
*Exegesis*: The *Explanation of Names* states: *Name* means "to call out." *Public* means "impartial." *Vessel* means "use." The *Master Yinwen* says: Names have three categories: first, names for designating things, such as square and round; second, names of praise and blame, such as good and evil; third, names of comparison and analogy, such as love and hate. What is discussed here is the name of praise and blame.

*Commentary*: To embellish beyond reality is to take excessively, and excessive taking brings chaos to the world.
*Subcommentary*: When fine reputations and good names are shared by the world, if one takes excessively, embellishment surpasses reality, and contention arises.

*Commentary*: Like a travelers’ lodge.
*Exegesis*: *Qū* is pronounced like *qú*. Sima and Guo explain: *Qū-lú* is like a travelers’ lodge.

*Commentary*: Benevolence and righteousness are human nature. Human nature changes, differing between ancient and modern times. Thus, when one wanders and passes through, it remains obscure; if one lingers and clings to one place, it becomes manifest. When it becomes manifest, artifice arises, and with artifice, excessive demands follow.
*Subcommentary*: *Qū-lú* is a travelers’ lodge. *Gòu* means "to see" or "to linger." A travelers’ lodge cannot be stayed in for long; benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom should be set aside once used. If a guest lingers too long, faults and flaws arise; if sagely traces remain, excessive demands follow.
*Exegesis*: *Gòu* is pronounced *gǔ* in the ancient tone, meaning "to see" or "to encounter."

The perfected ones of antiquity borrowed the Way of benevolence and lodged in righteousness, roaming in the emptiness of carefree wandering, feeding in the fields of simplicity, and standing in the garden of non-transaction. *Carefree wandering* means "non-action"; *simplicity* means "easy to nurture"; *non-transaction* means "nothing to give out." The ancients called this the wandering of gathering authenticity.

*Commentary*: Adapting to the times and changing without fixed traces.
*Subcommentary*: The true persons of antiquity harmonized their light and descended in traces, acting in accord with the moment and practicing universal love, responding to things and employing the multitude—how was this different from borrowing a path or lodging temporarily? Though their sojourn was brief, it was not real. Yet in movement they did not harm stillness, and in response they did not depart from the real. Thus, they ever roamed in the realm of self-contentment, wandering in the realm of non-action.
*Exegesis*: *Zhī xū* is pronounced *xū*. The original text also writes it as *xū* (mound).

Though it be provisional and simple, *gou-jian* means "temporary and unadorned." *Dai* means "to bestow." Knowing when to stop and when one has enough, one feeds from the fields of the provisional and simple; not diminishing one’s own possessions, one stands in the garden of non-transaction. Speaking of fields and gardens is to clarify that these are the grounds where the sages nurture life.

*Exegesis*: *Gou-jian*: Wang [Bi] says: *Gou* means "provisional," *jian* means "simple." The Sima edition writes *jian* as *xian*, glossing it as "to distinguish." ◎ Qingfan’s note: *Jian* in the Sima edition is written as *xian*. Note that *xian* and *jian* are the same. The *Huainanzi*’s *Yaolüe* chapter states: "Thus, moderating wealth and practicing frugal burials, one nurtures life in *xian* service" (*xian-fu* means "simple service"; *xian-fu* refers to the three-month mourning period). The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Pan Anren’s "Dirge for Attendant Gentleman Xiahou" and the *Lu Shi*’s *Hou Ji* both quote the *Huainanzi* as *jian-fu*. *Bu dai*: Pronounced *chì-dài*. Sima [Biao] says: "To bestow." *Zhi pu*: Pronounced *bǔ*.

*Commentary*: To act is to depart from humaneness and rightness.

*Commentary*: Since one follows simplicity, it is easy to nurture.

*Subcommentary*: Only because the encumbrances of carefree wandering are exhausted can one be without action and serene. *Gou-jian* means "provisional and simple," contenting oneself with sufficiency—thus, it is easy to nurture.

*Exegesis*: *Yi yang*: Pronounced *yì-chǐ*. The commentary is the same.

**【Six】**
*Commentary*: "Does not bestow" means not diminishing oneself for the sake of others.

*Subcommentary*: Not diminishing oneself to benefit another—thus, nothing is given. These three lines reiterate the preceding meaning.

*Exegesis*: *To make into things*: Pronounced *yú-wěi*.

**【Seven】**
*Commentary*: Wandering freely and following one’s nature—this is true essence. When essence is true, color is not false.

*Subcommentary*: The ancients’ sages practiced provisional simplicity and such methods, for their spirit and essence were genuine and without pretense. They roamed carefree, following their inclinations and wandering with transformation.

*Collation*:
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition has *xū* (虚) as *qū* (墟).
(2) The Shidetang edition has *sī* (斯) as *zé* (则).
(3) *Essence and truth* follows the Shidetang edition’s emendation.

Those who deem wealth right cannot yield emolument;
those who deem prominence right cannot yield fame.
Those who cling to power cannot share authority.

Grasping it, they tremble;
releasing it, they grieve—
yet without a single mirror to perceive
what they never cease pursuing:
these are the people Heaven punishes.

Resentment and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—
these eight are the instruments of rectification.
Only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them.

Thus it is said: Rectitude is rectification.
If one’s heart holds otherwise,
the Gate of Heaven will not open.

(5)
[Note 1] Never has the world seen one burdened by what they deem wrong—each perishes only for what they deem right. Those who perish for what they deem right do not stand in the garden of inexhaustible bounty.

[Commentary] To esteem wealth and despise poverty, to covet goods and bribes—how could such a one yield emolument to others? To esteem prominence and despise obscurity, to cling to glory and rank—how could such a one yield fame to others? To cherish power and authority, to vaunt oneself over things—how could such a one share authority with others? Only those who loathe the stench of worldly dust, who find glory and profit rank and foul, can cast them aside like refuse.

[Note 2] Those who grieve when releasing it cannot but tremble when grasping it.

[Commentary] Grasping authority, they fear its loss and so tremble; relinquishing power, they mourn its departure and so grieve.

[Textual Note] *Cao zhi* (操之): read *qī dāo* (七刀反). *She zhi* (舍之): read *shě* (舍). The note shares the same reading.

[Note 3] To know advance but not retreat is to forfeit one’s nature and life—hence they are punished.

[Commentary] Those who esteem wealth and crave power are dull of heart and benighted, mired in fame and profit, utterly lacking discernment. How could they perceive the profound Dao and rest their minds, still their wit? Such people, though no executioner’s blade has touched them, are already bound by their own nature—thus they are the people Heaven punishes.

[Textual Note] *Sang* (丧): read *sàng* (息浪反).

[Commentary] Resentment demands vengeance, gratitude repayment; what is due must be taken, what is not due given; ministers admonish their lords, fathers instruct their sons; life follows the verdant spring, death and punishment the withered autumn. These eight are the instruments of rectification—one cannot but wield them.

[Note 5] Clinging to the old without change is to lose rectitude.

[Commentary] *Xún* (循) means to follow; *yīn* (湮), to obstruct. Only those who follow human principle, adapt to change, and penetrate the nature of things without obstruction can wield these eight to govern. Rectitude and change accord with Heaven’s principle—thus it is said: Rectitude is rectification. Those whose hearts cannot do so find the Gate of Heaven barred and shut. *Tianmen* (天门) is the heart.

[Textual Note] *Yīn zhe* (湮者): read *yīn* (因). Li [Yi] says: to obstruct, also to stagnate. Guo [Xiang] reads *yān* (烟) or *wù jié* (乌节反). Sima’s edition has *yīn* (歅), meaning doubt. [Wang] Jianwen’s edition has *zhēn* (甄), meaning to block. *Tianmen* (天门): one says it is the heart; another, the great Dao.

[Emendation] (1) The Zhao Jianyi edition omits the character *ze* (则).

Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: “When chaff blinds the eye, heaven and earth and the four directions shift places; when mosquitoes and horseflies bite the skin, one cannot sleep through the night. Benevolence and righteousness, so harsh and bitter, stir the heart—no greater disorder exists! You, sir, would have the world not lose its uncarved simplicity. You, too, should drift with the wind and move, gather your virtue and stand—why then do you strain so mightily, like one bearing a drum in search of a lost child? The swan does not bathe daily to stay white, nor the crow blacken itself daily to stay black. The natural black and white of things are not worth debating; the spectacle of fame and reputation does not enlarge one’s being. When the spring dries, fish find themselves on dry land, where they moisten one another with breath and wet one another with foam—better they forget one another in rivers and lakes!”

[Note 1] Though the external thing be small, the harm to one’s nature is already great.

The Master Kong was mired in the traces of sageliness, and so when he spoke, his words turned to benevolence and righteousness. Now, scattering chaff into the eye blinds it, so that east and west cannot be distinguished; the bite of a mosquito or horsefly stings the skin, so that pain pierces the night and sleep flees. Thus, though external things be slight, the harm they bring is surely great. How much more so with benevolence, which is not Heaven’s principle, and righteousness, which does not follow one’s nature—abandoning the self to imitate others, one loses one’s original nature. What harm they bring—how could it be merely the blinding of the eye or the stinging of the skin?

*[Zām, "to bite."]*

*[Phonetic glosses: 播 (bō/pō),  (kāng), 蚊 (wén), 虻 (méng), 噆 (zǎn/zhá).]*
*[Sīmǎ: "to bite."]*
*[Tōngxī: "through the night."]*
*[Qìngfān’s note: xī means "evening"; tōngxī means "throughout the night." Lüshi Chunqiu’s "Rèn Dì" chapter says, "In the first month of summer’s evening, three leaves are cut to harvest barley." (Huainanzi’s "Tiānwén" chapter writes 夕, "evening," in full.) Shangshu Dàzhuàn says, "The moon’s morning, the moon’s middle, the moon’s evening," with Zheng’s commentary: "The first ten days are morning, the middle ten days are middle, the last ten days are evening." The character is also written 昔.]*

*[To impose them is to add to one’s nature, and so bring disorder.]*

Benevolence and righteousness are more venomous than mosquitoes and horseflies, stirring the heart with indignation and filling it with vexation, disturbing the nature of things—no greater disorder exists! *[Originally written 愦 (vexation), though this is uncertain.]*

*[Phonetic gloss: 憯 (cǎn), 愤 (fèn/fèn). Originally written 愦 (kuì).]*
*[Qìngfān’s note: 愤 in the original text is also written 愦; the latter is correct. The characters 贲 (bēn) and 贵 (guì) are similar in form, so characters using either component are often confused. Qiānfū Lùn’s "Fúchǐ" chapter reads "怀忧愦愦," while the Hànshū’s "Wáng Fú Zhuàn" writes 愤愤—proof of this.]*

*[When one’s substance is whole, benevolence and righteousness become manifest.]*

*[Move with the wind as it stirs, and hold fast to virtue as it stands—this is the Way of easy grasp and easy practice.]*

The *Exegesis* states: *Fang* 放 means "to let go, to follow one's nature." If one wishes to cause the common people to lose their pure and simple nature, nothing is better than severing benevolence and abandoning righteousness—this is to return to the profound extremity of the self.

Confucius, too, should propagate the teaching of non-action, responding to circumstances as they arise and engaging with things, embodying the supreme virtue of emptiness and establishing unfathomable spiritual power.

*[Variant reading: 放 (fàng), "to imitate" (fǎng wǎng fǎn). 放 (fàng) also means "to rely upon."]*

*[Phonetic gloss: 《亦放》 fāng wǎng fǎn. 《风而动》 Sīmǎ (Yì) says: 放 means "to rely upon," to act in accordance with the wind of non-action. 《易持易行》 both read with the sound chǐ.]*

The *Annotation* states: To raise up benevolence and righteousness in pursuit of the realm of the Dao and virtue is like striking a drum to seek a fugitive—there is no way to succeed.

The *Exegesis* states: *Jiàn* 建 means "to strike." *Jiérán* 杰然 describes the exertion of force. To raise up benevolence and righteousness in pursuit of the realm of the Dao and virtue—how is this different from beating a great drum to seek a runaway child? Thus, the louder the drum sounds, the farther the child flees; the more benevolence and righteousness are displayed, the more the Dao and virtue are abandoned.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《杰然》 Guō reads jū jié, also jū yè, jù jié. 《夫揭》 reads qí liè or qí yè.]*

The *Annotation* states: Each is naturally sufficient unto itself.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《鹄》 also written as 鹤, both hú. 《日黔》 reads jù yān, Xú reads qí jīn. Sīmǎ says: "black."]*

The *Annotation* states: Both are natural; there is no partiality.

The *Exegesis* states: *Yù* 浴 means "to bathe." *Rǎn zī yuē qián* 染缁曰黔 means "to dye with black." *Qián* 黔 means "black." *Biàn* 辩 means "to distinguish victory and defeat." The whiteness of the crane and the blackness of the crow are endowed by nature—how could they require daily bathing and dyeing to achieve this? By analogy, the natures of things follow the same principle. Black and white, in their unadorned simplicity, are each sufficient in their allotted portion; where they meet, they are fitting. Thus, it is only when they are insufficient in their portion that one debates victory and defeat.

*[Alternative interpretation: 辩 means "to change." Black and white are fixed in their distinctions; one cannot change white into black.]*

The *Annotation* states: The perfectly sufficient forget fame and reputation; only by forgetting fame and reputation can one be vast.

The *Exegesis* states: To cultivate fame and establish reputation is to attract the gaze of things—how narrow and petty is this, how unworthy of self-aggrandizement! Only by forgetting and relinquishing fame and reputation can one be called great.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《之观》 reads gǔ luàn. Sīmǎ’s version writes 讙.]*

The *Annotation* states: The praise of benevolence and righteousness all arises from insufficiency.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《泉涸》 hú luò. 《相呴》 xiàng xǔ, also xiàng yú. 《相濡》 rú zhǔ, also rú yú. 《以沫》 yǐ mò.]*

The *Annotation* states: This is to forget benevolence and thereby be benevolent.

The *Exegesis* states: This summarizes the preceding text, criticizing the flaws of benevolence and righteousness. When the spring dries up, fish moisten one another with foam; when simplicity scatters and purity disperses, one practices benevolence and righteousness to aid others. Yet when rivers and lakes are vast, each is sufficient and thus they forget one another; when the Dao and virtue are profoundly mysterious, one attains nature and thus becomes empty and tranquil. Since rivers and lakes are comparable to the Dao and virtue, and moistening foam is akin to benevolence and righteousness, measuring them in this way shows they are not to be spoken of on the same day.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《相忘》 both read as written.]*

*[Collation notes: (1) Quēwù cites the Zhāng Jūnfáng edition, which repeats the character 杰; the Zhào Jiànyì edition is the same. (2) 愤愤 follows the Hànshū emendation. (3) The Zhào Jiànyì edition writes 秉 as 乘. (4) 放 is suspected to be a scribal error for 仿.]*

Confucius, having visited Lǎodān, remained silent for three days.

His disciples asked: "Master, when you saw Lǎodān, what advice did you seek?"

The *Exegesis* states: Lǎozǐ was a great sage beyond the world, his transformations unfathomable and unmeasurable—thus, there was nothing to discuss.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《不谈》 also written as 不言.]*

The *Exegesis* states: Without specifying a name, it simply says "disciples," likely referring to those who had entered his hall and jointly raised this doubt. Having seen Lǎozǐ, he should have received instruction—why, then, did he remain silent for three days?

Confucius said: "Only now have I truly seen the dragon! The dragon coalesces into form and scatters into patterns, riding the clouds and qi, nurturing itself in yin and yang. My mouth gapes open and cannot close—what advice could I possibly seek from Lǎodān?"

The *Annotation* states: This refers to Lǎodān’s ability to transform.

The *Exegesis* states: The dragon’s virtue is constant transformation. By analogy, the perfected person’s concealment and manifestation are without fixed form. In essence, they coalesce into a wondrous body, the wondrous body being profound and obscure; in traces, they scatter into patterns, the patterns being radiant and resplendent.

The *Annotation* states: This speaks of their unfettered mastery, their natural sufficiency.

The *Exegesis* states: This means the perfected person rides the clouds and qi without intention, following yin and yang to nurture things.

The *Exegesis* states: *Xié* 嗋 means "to close." His heart trembled in awe, his mouth opened and could not close—how could he have the leisure to hear words of instruction?

*[Phonetic gloss: 《嗋》 xǔ jié, "to close."]*

*[Collation note: Quēwù cites the Jiāngnán ancient manuscript, which adds "his tongue lifted and could not speak" after 嗋.]*

Zǐgòng said: "Then are there indeed those who dwell like corpses yet manifest like dragons, thunder in their voices yet plumb the depths in silence, whose actions move like heaven and earth? Could I, too, observe such a one?" Thereupon, he sought an audience with Lǎodān on Confucius’ behalf.

The *Exegesis* states: This means the perfected person, in their dwelling, is as still as a corpse; in their emergence, they appear like a divine dragon. In speech, they resound like thunder; in silence, they are as profound as the abyss. Thus, when they rouse and act, they move like heaven and earth in generating things.

Having thus dwelt or emerged, spoken or fallen silent—how could there be any difference in their dwelling or emergence, speech or silence that would set them apart? Yet the perfected person must possess the power to emerge or remain, speak or keep silent without words. Thus, when Confucius beheld him, his mouth gaped open and could not close.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《龙见》 xián biàn fǎn.]*

*[Collation note: Quēwù cites the Jiāngnán ancient manuscript, which adds "至" before "人." Another variant in Zhāng Jūnfáng’s edition reads "哉" in place of "乎."]*

Zǐgòng, whose given name was Cì, sought to observe the dragon-like virtue of the perfected person and so went to meet him at Confucius’ behest.

*[Phonetic gloss: 《赐亦》 An alternate reading is "赐也."]*

Lǎodān was then sitting with legs sprawled in the hall when he responded, murmuring: "My years have turned and passed away—what would you teach or warn me of?" *[Annotation: "倨" means to sit with legs apart. "运" means time. Lǎozǐ, self-possessed and at ease, sat sprawled in the hall, carefree and unconstrained. Only when moved by others did he respond, softly voicing his words: "I am old and declining—what would you teach or warn me of?"]*

Zǐgòng said: "The governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors over the world differed, yet their reputations and renown were as one. Yet you alone deem them not to be sages—how can this be?"

*[Annotation: As customs grew thin or thick, their methods diverged; whether by toil or by arms, whether yielding or resisting, they differed. Yet their fame and good repute remained linked as one. "You dismiss the Three Kings as unworthy of sagehood—what is your meaning? Might I hear it?"]

*[Phonetic gloss: "夫三王" Some versions read "Three Sovereigns" instead of "Three Kings." According to the commentary, "Kings" is correct. The rest read "Three Sovereigns."]

*[Collation note: Quēwù reads "Kings" as "Sovereigns." Another variant in the Jiāngnán ancient manuscript adds "也" after "天下."]

Lǎodān said: "Young man, come closer! Why do you say they differed?"

*[Annotation: "Come closer and explain why you claim they differed."]

Zǐgòng replied: "Yao ceded to Shun, Shun ceded to Yu. Yu governed through labor, while Tang resorted to arms. King Wen submitted to Zhòu without daring to oppose him, while King Wu opposed Zhòu and refused to submit. Thus I say they differed."

*[Annotation: Yao and Shun are counted among the Five Emperors; from Xia Yu onward, they are the Three Kings. Yao yielded to Shun, Shun to Yu. Yu tamed the floods through labor, Tang overthrew Jié with arms. King Wen was imprisoned at Yǒulǐ yet submitted to Shāng Xīn, while King Wu crossed the Mèngjīn Ford to defy Yīn Zhòu. Their differing ways may be briefly described thus.]

*[Collation note: The Dūnhuáng manuscript reads these six characters as "Yao gave and Shun received."]

Lǎodān said: "Young man, come closer! Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors over the world.

The Yellow Emperor’s governance made the people’s hearts one: when their parents died, they did not weep, and none among the people found fault with this.

Yao’s governance made the people’s hearts affectionate: when they killed for their parents, none among the people found fault with this.

Shun’s governance made the people’s hearts competitive: pregnant women bore children at ten months, and those children could speak at five months. Before they could even crawl, they began to ask, ‘Who is this?’—and thus people first began to die young.

Yu’s governance made the people’s hearts mutable: each person had their own mind, and weapons followed suit. Killing thieves was not considered killing. People acted as their own kind, and the world was left to itself. Thus the world was greatly alarmed, and the Ru and Mohists arose.

Their beginnings had order, yet now we have women—what more can be said!

I tell you: the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was called ‘governance,’ yet no chaos was greater than theirs.

The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of sun and moon above, severed the essence of mountains and rivers below, and disrupted the workings of the four seasons in between.

Their knowledge was crueler than the sting of scorpions or centipedes, more savage than the beasts that lurk in the wilds. None could preserve the true nature of their lives, yet they still called themselves sages. Is this not shameful? Truly, they knew no shame!"*

*[Annotation: If the people had found fault, they would have been forced to weep.]

The Three Sovereigns practiced the Dao, and the people’s hearts were pure and unified. They did not exclusively cherish their own kin nor exclusively dote upon their own children, so when kin died, none wept, and the customs of the age did not condemn it. Yet if condemnation arose, those who forced themselves to weep would be many.

The Five Emperors practiced virtue, though not to the extent of the Three Sovereigns. They caused fathers and sons, brothers and kin to cherish one another in turn, establishing graded mourning rites to distinguish closeness from distance. This accorded with the people’s hearts and drew no censure. Yet the distinctions of closeness and distance were already a descent.

Shun, the last of the Five Emperors, saw customs grow increasingly shallow, simplicity scatter, and purity dissolve. The people’s hearts became restless and competitive, so that pregnant women bore children after ten months, and infants could speak at five. In ancient times, pregnant women carried their children for fourteen months before giving birth, and children did not speak until they were two. With simplicity transformed, the present diverged from the ancient ways.

Before they could even smile, infants already distinguished right from wrong, and the mind of discrimination began from this. Unable to harmonize self and other, their hearts competed over closeness and distance, and so they did not live out their Heaven-appointed years. The onset of early death began with the age of Yu.

As the Dao receded, artifice flourished daily, and the foolish people grew fond of calamity. They abandoned the traces of non-action and embraced the impulse to act, rewarding good and punishing evil as their guiding principle. Yet even Yu, moved by compassion, wept for those condemned to death. When the blade fell, it was only in accord with Heaven’s Dao.

Thieves deserved death, and killing them was in accord with principle—thus, though they were killed, it was not truly killing. This was the righteousness inherent in the use of arms.

Yet when the myriad things could not be brought into great harmony and each person distinguished themselves from others, they became as separate species. Carrying forward the currents of a hundred generations to meet the changes of the present age, the corruption reached this point—not through Yu’s doing, but through the world itself. The traces of sagely wisdom did not disrupt the world, yet the world inevitably fell into such disorder.

With artifice flourishing and distinctions growing daily, each person became their own kind and could not bring the myriad things into great unity. This was the consequence of the human mind. The traces of sagely wisdom brought it to this, yet it was not Yu’s fault—it was the world’s doing.

In the time of Zhuangzi, the six states vied for power, and wanton customs spread widely. Taking women as wives violated ritual and defied virtue more than ever before. Thus, we know that when the traces of sages first arose, they established order and principle, but in their decline, all fell into such corruption.

From order, teachings emerged, leading to this. With customs shallow and the age degenerate, what more can be said? The master speaks in grief and lament.

The governance of the Three Sovereigns was truly non-action. Yet the traces of non-action gave rise to corruption, so that in later ages, no chaos was greater than this.

The manifestations of corruption and chaos are enumerated below.

The stars and constellations rebel, comets arise, and the sun and moon lose their brightness. The mountains and rivers fall into discord, the great peaks and rivers collapse and run dry. The four seasons are disrupted, and cold and heat fall out of order.

The wisdom of non-action was employed to establish methods of governance, but later ages clung to its traces, thus giving rise to such corruption.

The harm wrought by the wisdom of the Three Sovereigns upon the people was more venomous than that of scorpions and centipedes. Thus, even the smallest creatures were disturbed, let alone the common folk—how could they find peace? To call this sagely is contrary to reason. The extent of this poisonous harm is deeply shameful.

《憯于》 is pronounced *cǎn yú*. 《蛎》 is pronounced *chì mài*, or alternatively *lì*. Originally also written as 厉. Guo [Pu] reads it as *lài*, or alternatively *chì jiè*. 《虿》 is pronounced *xū yè*, or alternatively *chì mài*. Some say: according to the characters, the upper should be written as 虿, and the lower as 蝎. *Tongsu Wen* states: those with long tails are called 虿, and those with short tails are called 蝎.

◎ Wang Yinzhi says: *Shiwen* states that 蛎 is pronounced *chì mài*, or alternatively *lì*, and originally also written as 厉. Guo [Pu] reads it as *lài*, or alternatively *chì jiè*. 虿 is pronounced *xū yè*, or alternatively *chì mài*. Some say: according to the characters, the upper should be written as 虿, and the lower as 蝎. I note that Lu [Deming] reads 蛎 as 虿 and 虿 as 蝎—both are incorrect. □ is pronounced *lài*, or alternatively *lì*. Lu [Deming] says it was originally written as 厉, which serves as evidence. 虿 is pronounced *chì mài*; 蝎 is pronounced *xū yè*. □ and 虿 are both alternative names for 蝎. *Guang Ya* states: 虿, □, and 蝎 [are the same]. (The current edition of *Guang Ya* omits the □ character. *Yiqiejing Yinyi*, Volume 5, cites *Guang Ya*: "虿, □, 蝎." *Jiyun* cites *Guang Ya*: "□, 虿." The character is now restored accordingly.) □ is pronounced *lú dá*. 虿 and □ are both names for creatures whose venom stings and harms people. The word 虿 is derived from □. (□ is pronounced *zhé*. *Yiqiejing Yinyi*, Volume 10, cites *Zilin*: "□ means to sting." *Zuozhuan Zhengyi* for the 22nd year of Duke Xi cites *Tongsu Wen*: "When a scorpion’s venom harms a person, it is called □.") □ is derived from 瘌. (瘌 is pronounced *lú dá*. Guo Pu’s commentary on *Fangyan* states: "瘌 means a painful sting." The character is sometimes written as 刺. Zuo Si’s *Wei Du Fu* says: "Thorns and brambles sting and pierce; insects and worms poison and bite.") *Guang Ya Shigu* states: "毒, □, 瘌, and 痛 all mean pain"—this is their meaning. □ and □ are homophonous in ancient pronunciation. *Zhuangzi* writes it as □, while *Guang Ya* writes it as □—in fact, they are the same character. (In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Annals of Qin*, the name 厉共公 appears in the *Basic Annals of Qin* as 剌龚公. The interchangeability of 剌 and 厉 is analogous to that of □ and □.)

《鲜规之兽》 Li [Yi] says: 鲜规 means "bright in appearance." Another says: it refers to small insects. Yet another says: it refers to small beasts.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The *Shide Tang* edition writes 皇 as 王.
(2) *Quewu* cites the Jiangnan Ancient Collection edition, which includes the character 昔 before 黄.
(3) The Tang manuscript writes 其杀 as 其服.

Zigong stood uneasily, shifting from foot to foot.

**Commentary:** Zigong had originally believed that Laozi alone surpassed the Three Kings, and thus sought to equate the Three Kings with the Five Emperors. Now, seeing Laozi extend his critique to the Five Emperors and even the Three Sovereigns, he lost the basis of his argument.

**Exegesis:** 蹴蹴 describes a startled and fearful appearance. Zigong wished to align the Three Kings with the Five Emperors; now, witnessing Laozi’s lofty and distant discourse—rejecting the Five Emperors and censuring the Three Sovereigns—his mind and form were shaken, and he lost his bearings. Thus, he stood 蹴蹴然, his posture upright but his spirit unsettled.

《蹴蹴》 is pronounced *zǐ liù*.

Confucius said to Lao Dan: "I have studied the Six Classics—*Poetry*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn*—and have long considered myself well-versed in their principles. I have advised seventy-two rulers, expounding the Dao of the former kings and clarifying the traces of Zhou and Shao, yet not one ruler has adopted my counsel. How difficult it is to persuade others! How hard it is to make the Dao clear!"

Laozi said: "Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-governed age! The Six Classics are but the discarded traces of the former kings—how could they be that by which the traces were made? What you now speak of are still only traces. Traces are what the shoe produces, yet are traces the shoe itself?

The white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils unmoving, and yet the wind effects transformation. The male insects cry from the upwind, the females respond from the downwind, and the wind effects transformation. Like naturally divides into male and female, and thus the wind effects transformation. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be done; if one loses it, there is nothing that can be done."

The Master of Records states: "They are the young of birds." *Regarding "gaze at one another with their pupils"*: pronounced *mòhóu*. *Regarding "their young are transformed by the wind without movement"*: The Master of Records states: "They await the qi of the wind to transform and give birth." He also says: "They form yin and yang by gazing at one another." *Regarding "the male insects cry from the upwind, the females respond from the downwind, and transform"*: One version reads "and are transformed by the wind." The Master of Records states: "The males belong to the soft-shelled turtle kind; the females, to the hard-shelled turtle kind."

Now, creatures of the same kind, male and female, each possess their own means of mutual resonance. The variations in this resonance are boundless. If they belong to the same kind, transformation is not difficult—thus, there are even those who resonate from afar and are transformed by the wind.

*Annotation*: Some explain that among the categories of things, this is like grasses and trees of different species yet the same kind. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "On Danyuan Mountain, there is a beast resembling a leopard but with fur, called the *shilei*; on Dai Mountain, there is a bird resembling a phoenix with five-colored patterns, called the *qilei*—both reproduce through their own males and females." *Regarding "boundless"*: pronounced *shēng*.

Thus, the perfected person follows and flows with these principles.

*Regarding "can be obstructed"*: pronounced *yōng*.

Though transformations have no fixed direction, all are possible.

Wherever one loses the Dao, nothing is possible.

*Textual Note*: (1) The *Quewu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, which includes the character *gǎn* ("resonance") after *ér* ("and"), and the same applies to the following clause. (2) The *Quewu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, which includes the character *yuē* ("say") after *gù* ("thus"). (3) Modern texts read *ér huà* ("and transform") as *ér fēng huà* ("and are transformed by the wind").

Confucius did not emerge for three months, then reappeared and said: "I have attained it! Crows and magpies nurture their young, fish coat themselves in foam, creatures with slender waists transform, and the elder brother weeps for his younger brother. How long it has been since I, Qiu, joined with transformation to become human! If one does not join with transformation to become human, how can one transform others?"

*Annotation*: This speaks of the spontaneity of things, each possessing its own nature.

**Annotation and Exegesis:**
Magpies dwell within their nests, mating to manifest yin and yang; fish remain in water, coating themselves in foam to become male and female; bees take mulberry grubs and, through incantation, make them their own offspring. Thus we know that the natures of things differ, each endowed by the great Dao. The spontaneity of things, each possessing its own nature, is so.

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Fùjiàn* ("reappeared"): *fúyòu* reflex.
Below, *xiánbiàn* ("all-pervading"): also read as the common word.
*Wūquè rú* ("crows and magpies nurture"): *rúyù* reflex. Li [Yun] says: to hatch and give birth.
*Yú fù* ("fish coat"): *fù* sound, also *fù* sound. Originally also written as *zhuàn* ("transmit"), *zhí zhuān* reflex.
*Mò* ("foam"): *mò* sound. Sima [Biao] says: "to transmit foam" means to nurture one another with foam. Another explanation: they coat their mouths with foam and together produce offspring.
*Xìyāo* ("slender-waisted"): *yīyáo* reflex.
*Zhě huà* ("those that transform"): refers to bees and the like. Sima [Biao] says: they take mulberry grubs and incant over them to make them resemble their own offspring. This is what the *Book of Songs* means by "the green caterpillar has young, the sphex carries them away."
◎Qing Fan’s note: The *Liezi* phonetic glosses cite Sima [Biao] as saying: "Young bees with slender waists take mulberry grubs, incant over them, and make them resemble their own offspring." This is more detailed than what the phonetic glosses here record.

**Annotation:**
This speaks of human nature, which abandons the elder to cherish the younger, hence the weeping.

**Exegesis:**
When an elder brother has a younger brother and loses affection, abandoning the elder to cherish the younger, he weeps. Thus we know that one must not cling to past traces but should follow the natural course. Free from entanglements between things and self, [Guo Xiang says:] this speaks of human nature, which abandons the elder to cherish the younger, hence the weeping.

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Shě* ("abandon"): *shě* sound.
*Zhǎng* ("elder"): *zhāng zhàng* reflex.

**Annotation:**
To align with transformation as a person is to allow oneself to transform naturally. If one were to propagate the Six Classics to persuade others, it would be superficial.

Laozi said: "Good. Qiu has grasped it!"

**Chapter 15: Carving Intent (External Chapters)**
**Chapter 16: Cultivating Nature (External Chapters)**
**Chapter 15: Carving Intent**

**Annotation:**
The chapter is named for its theme.

Those who carve intent and exalt conduct, who depart from the world and differ from common customs, who engage in lofty discourse and resentful slander—do so merely to reach extremity. These are the scholars of mountain valleys, men not of this world, those who favor withering away or plunging into the abyss.

Those who speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, who practice reverence, frugality, deference, and yielding—do so merely to cultivate themselves. These are the scholars of peaceful eras, men of instruction and edification, those who favor wandering in leisure and learning.

Those who speak of great achievements, establish great reputations, observe the rites between ruler and minister, and rectify the hierarchy—do so merely to govern. These are the scholars of the court, men who honor the sovereign and strengthen the state, those who favor achieving merit and annexing others.

Those who dwell in marshes and wilds, who abide in seclusion and open spaces, who fish and idle—do so merely to be without action. These are the scholars of rivers and seas, men who shun the world, those who favor leisure and tranquility.

Those who practice breathing exercises, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, who emulate the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—do so merely to prolong life. These are the scholars who guide *qi*, men who nurture the body, those who favor the longevity of Peng Zu.

**Exegesis:**
*Ke* means to carve; *yi* means intent. *Kang* means extremity. These partial and stagnant men, unable to grasp the principle, carve and discipline their bodies and minds, exalt their conduct, depart from the world and differ from common customs, standing aloof and apart. They discourse on the winds of the Five Emperors, expound on the teachings of the Three Sovereigns, resent the talented who meet no opportunity, and slander the wayless who indulge in excess. Their lofty intent dwells among the groves and winds, their carved traces lie beneath cliffs and crags. These are the scholars who hide in mountain valleys, men who revile the times. Some wither like Bao Jiao and Jie Zitui, others plunge into the abyss like Shen Tu and Bian Sui—mere one-sided scholars, how could they speak of the supreme Dao? *Yi* means to stop. Their arts stop here.

**Annotation and Exegesis**

*Ke yi* (刻意): Sima [Biao] says: "Ke means to carve; it sharpens the intent." The note explains: to carve the intent and make it acute.
*Guangya* says: "Yi means aspiration."
*Shang xing* (尚行): Read *meng* in the lower tone.
*Li shi* (離世): Read *li* as in "to depart," *zhi* as in "wisdom."
*Gao lun* (高論): Read *li* as in "strength," *kun* as in "exhaustion."
*Yuan fei* (怨誹): Read *fei* as in "slander," Xu [Shen] pronounces it *fei*. Li [Yi] says: "To resent the world’s lack of the Dao is to resent one’s own failure to meet opportunity."
*Wei kang* (為亢): Read *kang* as in "exhaustion." Li [Yi] says: "To be exhausted in loftiness is called *kang*."
*Ku gao* (枯槁): Read *ku* as in "withered," *lao* as in "aged."
*Fu yuan* (赴淵): Sima [Biao] says: "Withered and emaciated, like Bao Jiao and Jie Zitui; plunging into the abyss, like Shen Tu and Bian Sui."

**[Section Two]**
**Exegesis:** When they give voice to their breath, their words turn to benevolence and righteousness, employing these methods as the foundation of self-cultivation. These are the scholars of peaceful and well-ordered times, the men who instruct and enlighten others. Such were Zixia in the West River, Confucius dwelling by the Zhu and Si—some traveling to discourse and debate, others settled to lecture and expound. These are the pursuits beloved by students, but they are not the first concern of Daoists.

**Annotation:**
*Suo hao* (所好): Read *hao* as in "to love." The same applies below and in the commentary.

**[Section Three]**
**Exegesis:** They establish merit throughout the realm, erect great names for all ages, perfect the grand rites of ruler and minister, and uphold the great principles of high and low. They pacify and secure the altars of state, brighten and sustain the constant Dao. Then they exalt the ruler and subdue distant lands, strengthen the homeland and annex rival states. Are these not the scholars of the court, the ministers of the hallowed halls? Such were Gaoyao, Yi Yin, and Lü Wang.

**Annotation:**
*Wei zhi* (為治): Read *zhi* as in "to govern." The same applies below.
*Ci chao* (此朝): Read *chao* as in "court."

**[Section Four]**
**Exegesis:** They dwell in reclusion among mountains and marshes, roam freely through riverbanks and marshes, live in leisure while angling and fishing, withdraw from the world to abide in nonaction. The Son of Heaven cannot make them his subjects, the feudal lords cannot make them their friends. These are the men of ease and leisure—such as Chaofu, Xu You, and Gong Yueren.

**Annotation:**
*Sǒu* (薮): Read *sou* as in "marsh."
*Chu xian* (處閒): Read *xian* as in "leisure." The same applies below.
*Diao yu* (釣魚): The original also writes *diao* (釣). Both are read *diao* as in "to angle." ◎Lu Wenchang notes: The modern text writes *diao* (釣).

**[Section Five]**
**Commentary:** Though these men differ in their pursuits, each indulges his own inclination and follows his own path—this too is a way of attaining freedom. Yet this is merely self-attainment; how can it be universally applied? If one wishes to ensure that the myriad things each attain their proper place without losing themselves, one must entrust it to nonaction and non-attachment.

**Exegesis:** They exhale the old with a cold breath, inhale the new with a warm one—like bears climbing trees to hang themselves, or birds stretching their legs in flight. These are all methods of guiding and refining the spirit and *qi*, nurturing the body and soul, the way to prolong life, the art of preserving form. Thus Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, White Stone three thousand—such are the long-lived. The aforementioned men, though differing in their aspirations, each clung to one corner and failed to achieve perfect harmony. Only from *Ke yi* onward do they begin to grasp the subtleties of the profound Dao.

**Exegesis Notes:**
*Chuixu* (吹呴) is pronounced *kuàng yú fǎn*; the character may also be written as 喣.
*Huxi* (呼吸) is pronounced *xǔ jí fǎn*.
*Tu gu na xin* (吐故纳新): Li [Yun] says: "Exhale the old *qi*, inhale the new *qi*."
*Xiong jing* (熊经) is read as written; Li [Yun] reads it as *gǔ dìng fǎn*. Sima [Biao] says: "Like a bear climbing a tree to guide the *qi*."
*Niao shen* (鸟申) is read as written; Guo [Xiang] pronounces it *xìn*. Sima [Biao] says: "Like a bird stretching and groaning in flight."
*Daoyin* (道引) is pronounced *dǎo*; same below. Li [Yun] says: "Guide the *qi* to harmonize it, stretch the body to soften it."
*Ci shu* (此数) is pronounced *suǒ zhǔ fǎn*.
*Jin* (仅) is pronounced *qí jìn fǎn*.
*Yan neng* (焉能) is pronounced *rú qián fǎn*.

**Textual Note:** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *dao* (道) as *dao* (导); same below.

As for one who does not strive with intent yet rises high, who cultivates without relying on benevolence and righteousness, who governs without pursuing merit and fame, who finds leisure without retreating to rivers and seas, who attains longevity without guiding and refining—such a one forgets nothing, yet possesses all. Serene and boundless, all virtues follow in their wake. This is the Way of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.

**Annotation:** (1) That is, what is called "natural."
(2) **Annotation:** To forget is thus to possess; if one possesses, one cannot truly forget. Thus, to possess is not to possess by possessing, but to possess by forgetting.
**Exegesis:** The scholar who fathoms the profound and embraces change, the one who darkly accords with truth—such a person does not strive with intent yet their Way grows ever higher; they cultivate without relying on benevolence and righteousness; they forget merit and fame yet the world is well-governed; they leave behind rivers and seas yet remain serene and at ease; they do not guide and refine yet their lifespan knows no limit. Thus, they can regard all things and the self as one, forgetting all without exception, while all things return to them—hence, they lack nothing. This is to possess by forgetting, not to possess by possessing.

◎ Jia Shifu says: Benevolence and righteousness are what appear in human interactions. To love is called benevolence; to love others because of them is still to retain the perception of others. To act appropriately is called righteousness; to act appropriately because of others is still to retain the perception of the self. Without the perception of self or others, the names of benevolence and righteousness need not be established, and what one cultivates is true cultivation.

◎ Qingfan notes: *Wang* (忘) is a loan for *wang* (亡), meaning "to cease." The *Guanzi* ("Riding Horse" chapter) says, "Today’s goods are forgotten for tomorrow’s"; the *Records of the Grand Historian* ("Biography of Mengchang Jun") says, "Do not forget what we have agreed upon"—both use *wang* in the sense of *wang*. The *Book of Han* ("Biographies of the Five Sons of Emperor Wu") says, "I have heard that Zixu was loyal yet forgot his title"; Yan Shigu’s commentary: "*Wang* means *wang*." The *Huainanzi* ("Cultivating Effort" chapter) says, "Nanrong Chou was ashamed that the sagely Way had alone ceased in himself"; the *Xunzi* ("Encouraging Learning" chapter) writes *wang* as *wang*—all are examples of this usage.

**Annotation:** (3) If one forces oneself to act, one cannot be boundless, and all evils arise.
**Exegesis:** With the mind not fixed on one corner and traces darkly aligned with the five phases, one remains serene and empty, their Way inexhaustible, and all virtues follow in their wake.

**Exegesis Notes:**
*Dan* (澹) is pronounced *dà zhàn fǎn*; Xu [Shen] reads it as *tán*. *Ran* (然) in one edition reads *dan er* (澹而).

**Annotation:** (4) That which does not act for the sake of the myriad things yet the myriad things arise of themselves is Heaven and Earth; that which does not act for the sake of the hundred practices yet the hundred practices are perfected of themselves is the sage.
**Exegesis:** Heaven and Earth do not intend to nurture yet the myriad things are born; the sage does not intend to transform yet the hundred practices are perfected. Thus, Heaven and Earth use non-production to produce, and the sage uses non-action to act as virtue. Hence, the *Laozi* says, "Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; the sage is not benevolent."

**Exegesis Notes:**
*Bai xing* (百行) is pronounced *xià mèng fǎn*; same below and at the end of the chapter.

Thus it is said: Serenity, tranquility, stillness, silence, emptiness, nothingness, non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the essence of the Way and virtue.

Thus it is said: When the sage rests in this, they are at peace and ease. At peace and at ease, they are serene and tranquil. Serene and tranquil, then cares and troubles cannot enter, and perverse *qi* cannot invade. Thus, their virtue is whole and their spirit is not diminished.

**Annotation:** (1) If it were not for stillness, silence, and non-action, their equilibrium would be endangered and their essence lost.
**Exegesis:** Serenity and tranquility are the mind of concentrated stillness; emptiness, nothingness, and non-action are the wisdom of quiescent function. Heaven and Earth take this as the source of their equilibrium; the Way and virtue take this as the foundation of their essence.

**Exegesis Notes:**
*Tian dan* (恬惔) is pronounced *dà zhàn fǎn*; Xu [Shen] reads it as *tán*. Same below.
*Zhi ye* (质也): *Zhi* means "correct."
*Er sang* (而丧) is pronounced *xī làng fǎn*; same below.

**Annotation:** (2) To rest in serenity, tranquility, stillness, and silence, to repose in emptiness, nothingness, and non-action—then, though one may traverse perilous changes, one remains ever at peace and free from difficulty.
**Exegesis:** Resting the mind in the realm of serenity and tranquility, reposing the intellect in the state of emptiness and nothingness—then one treads through hardship with ease and traverses danger with equanimity.

**Exegesis Notes:**
*Ren xiu* (人休) is pronounced *xū qiú fǎn*, meaning "to rest." Same below and in the annotation.
*Ping yi* (平易) is pronounced *yǐ chǐ fǎn*; same below and in the annotation.
◎ Yu Yue says: The characters *xiu yan* (休焉) are mistakenly reversed in transmission. The original text reads: "Thus it is said: The sage rests in this; at rest, they are at peace and at ease." The *Tian Dao* chapter says, "Thus, the emperors, kings, and sages rest in this; at rest, they are empty"—the structure is similar and can be used to correct this passage.
*Wu nan* (无难) is pronounced *nǎi dàn fǎn*; same below.

**Annotation:** (3) Troubles arise from action; action also arises from troubles. Thus, peace, ease, serenity, and tranquility mutually complete one another.

The *Exegesis* states: Is it only that a tranquil and serene heart leads to peace and ease? Indeed, peace and ease also engender serenity and tranquility—thus it is known that peace, ease, serenity, and tranquility mutually complete one another.

**Annotation (4):** Merging imperceptibly with the right principle as it proceeds.

**Exegesis:** With the heart serene and the conduct at ease, both mind and action embody a single non-action. Thus, profound worries and worldly burdens cannot enter their sacred chamber, nor can perverse *qi* or malevolent vapors invade their viscera. "Invade" means to enter, a variation in phrasing.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Xie qi* (邪氣) is pronounced *sì jiē fǎn*; same below.

**Annotation (5):** Those who are neither at peace nor tranquil—do they merely harm their physical form? Their spiritual *power* and inner *virtue* are also lost within.

**Exegesis:** As for those who are tranquil and non-active, do they merely remain unharmed in outward form? Their inner *virtue* is also complete and whole. With both form and *virtue* at peace, their spirit and essence suffer no depletion.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The *Quewu* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, where *xiuxiu yan* (休休焉) appears as *xiu yan xiu* (休焉休).
(2) The Tang manuscript includes the character *ye* (也) after both *ru* (入) and *xi* (袭).
(3) The Tang manuscript includes the character *yi* (矣) after *kui* (亏).
(4) The *Shidetang* edition reads *xianzu* (险阻).

Thus it is said: In life, the sage moves as the heavens move; in death, they transform as things transform. At rest, they share the *power* of *yin*; in motion, they flow with the waves of *yang*. They do not precede fortune, nor do they initiate misfortune. They respond only after being stirred, act only when pressed, and rise only when unavoidable. They discard knowledge and contrivance, following the principle of heaven. Thus, they suffer no heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, and no blame from spirits. Their life is like floating; their death, like resting. They do not ponder, nor do they plan ahead. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not bound by expectation. In sleep, they dream not; awake, they know no sorrow. Their spirit is pure and unadulterated; their soul does not weary. Empty, tranquil, and serene—they accord with the *virtue* of heaven.

**Annotation (1):** Moving in accordance with nature.

**Annotation (2):** Shedding their form without attachment.

**Exegesis:** The sage embodies the unity of labor and rest, comprehending the oneness of departure and return. Thus, in life, they move like the heavens’ course; in death, they transform like the myriad things, submitting to the molding of the forge without the slightest obstruction in their heart.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Tui ran* (蜕然) is pronounced *shuì*, or alternatively *shǐ ruì fǎn*.

**Annotation (3):** In stillness and motion, they are without intent, entrusting themselves to *yin* and *yang*.

**Exegesis:** With spirit concentrated and thoughts stilled, they share the abundant *power* of great *yin*; when stirred to action, they move with the waves of *yang*’s *qi*. In stillness and motion, they follow the seasons, acting without intent.

**Annotation (4):** They initiate nothing.

**Exegesis:** To precede fortune with goodness or initiate misfortune with evil—having abandoned both good and evil, they have also forgotten fortune and misfortune. They respond only after being stirred; how could they be the first to act?

**Annotation (5):** They act only upon encounter.

**Exegesis:** *Po* (迫) means arrival or compulsion. *Dong* (动) means response. Harmonious yet not initiating, they respond to the moment as it arises.

**Annotation (6):** Rising in accordance with principle, they cannot but act.

**Exegesis:** *Yi* (已) means cessation. When the moment’s stimulus compels, and the matter admits no delay, they rise in response—not by premeditation.

**Annotation (7):** The principle of heaven is natural; knowledge and contrivance have no place in it.

**Exegesis:** *Xun* (循) means to follow. Within, they discard the mind’s knowledge; without, they forget contrived affairs. Like the undifferentiated state of primordial chaos, they follow the wondrous principle of nature.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Qu zhi* (去知) is pronounced *qǐ lǚ fǎn*.
◎ Qingfan’s note: *Gu* (故) means deception. The *Guoyu* states: "Many contrivances are made to alter one’s resolve." Wei’s commentary says: "This refers to devising many schemes to change one’s intent." The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Lun Ren* chapter says: "Discard craft and deception." Gao’s commentary: "Craft and deception mean falsity." The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhu Shu* chapter states: "Where contrivance is many, deception below is also many." Gao’s commentary: "*Gu* means craft." All are examples of this. The *Guanzi*’s *Xin Shu* chapter says: "Discard knowledge and contrivance." Yin Zhizhang’s commentary: "*Gu* means affairs"—this is incorrect.

**Annotation (8):** Disasters arise from opposing heaven.

**Exegesis:** Accordant with heaven, they suffer no disasters.

**Annotation (9):** Burdens arise from opposing things.

**Exegesis:** Harmonious with things, they bear no burdens.

**Annotation (10):** Those who are the same as others are surely affirmed by the multitude.

**Exegesis:** Identical to others, they incur no reproach.

**Annotation (11):** Identical to self-possession, they incur no blame.

**Annotation (12):** Floating without attachment.

**Exegesis:** The sage, without intent in action or stillness, unifies life and death. Thus, in life, they are like a fleeting bubble’s rise, transforming in an instant; in death, they rest as if weary, without lingering attachment.

**Annotation (13):** Entrusting it to the principle of heaven.

**Exegesis:** Their heart is like dead ashes, cut off from all entanglements.

**Annotation (14):** Responding as principle arrives.

**Exegesis:** Like a mirror hung high in a hall, it reflects whatever comes before it, never premeditating or anticipating affairs.

**Annotation (15):** Using the world’s own radiance, not their own brilliance.

**Exegesis:** The light of their wisdom shines brighter than the sun and moon, yet they conceal their brilliance and obscure their traces, never dazzling others.

**Annotation (16):** Using the world’s own trustworthiness, not their own expectation.

**Exegesis:** Responding to the moment’s stimulus, they are like a shadow following form—trustworthy as the four seasons, without error or deviation. They respond only when the moment arrives, never anticipating it.

**Annotation (17):** In sleep, they do not dream; awake, they know no sorrow.

**Exegesis:** Their spirit is pure and undefiled; their soul does not weary. Empty, tranquil, and serene—they accord with the *virtue* of heaven.

**Annotation (17):**
Accordant with the true, they are thus serene and dreamless; their encumbrances exhausted, they are ever content and free from sorrow.

**Textual Note:** 《其觉》 pronounced as *gǔ xiào* in ancient rhyme.

**Annotation (18):**
Desiring nothing.

**Exegesis:**
"Pure" means undefiled. Having no dreams, no sorrows, and accordant with the true and the Dao, their mind and spirit are thus pure and free from杂念.

**Textual Note:** 《粹》 pronounced as *suì* in ancient rhyme.

**Annotation (19):**
Fatigue arises only from desire.

**Exegesis:**
Tranquil and inactive, their mind and spirit are at ease, so their essence and soul remain ever responsive, never weary.

**Textual Note:** 《不罢》 pronounced as *pí*.

**Annotation (20):**
Thus do they unite with heaven and earth in their *virtue* of tranquility.

**Exegesis:**
In praising this emptiness and nothingness, they unite their *virtue* with heaven and earth.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The character *逼* is amended based on the preceding exegesis. The original text reads *迫而后动* ("moved only under compulsion"), where the exegesis explains *迫* as *至* ("arrival") or *逼* ("compulsion"). *逼* and *通* are graphically similar and likely miswritten.
(2) The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character *其*.

Thus it is said:
Joy and sorrow are the aberrations of *virtue*;
Anger and delight are the transgressions of the Dao;
Likes and dislikes are the failings of *virtue*.

Therefore:
A mind free from joy and sorrow is the perfection of *virtue*;
Unchanging unity is the perfection of stillness;
No resistance to anything is the perfection of emptiness;
No engagement with things is the perfection of tranquility;
No opposition to anything is the perfection of purity.

Thus it is said:
When the body labors without rest, it becomes worn;
When the essence is employed without cease, it becomes weary;
Weary, it is exhausted.

**Annotation (1):**
Grief arises from defiance of the heart; joy from compliance with it. Failing to comprehend this defiance and compliance is the perversion of *virtue*.

**Textual Note:** 《悲乐》 pronounced as *bēi luò*. The same below.

**Annotation (2):**
Delight arises from gratification of the heart; anger from frustration of the emotions. To harbor delight and anger without forgetting them is the transgression of the Dao.

**Annotation (3):**
To mistake non-preference for preference, non-aversion for aversion—this deluded heart is the fault of *virtue*.

**Textual Note:** 《好恶》 pronounced as *hào wù*.

**Annotation (4):**
The perfection of *virtue* is ever content, so the emotions have nothing to seize upon.

**Exegesis:**
Neither delight nor anger, neither sorrow nor joy—tranquil, empty, and equanimous—such is the person of perfect *virtue*.

**Annotation (5):**
Stillness and unity cannot be altered.

**Exegesis:**
Embracing the mysterious Dao of true unity, they merge with the dust of the world without change. Who but one of perfect stillness could achieve this?

**Annotation (6):**
Their mind is vast and utterly empty, leaving no trace of resistance.

**Exegesis:**
*忤* means opposition. In perfect accord with all beings, they harbor no resistance. Who but one of perfect emptiness could achieve this?

**Textual Note:** 《于忤》 pronounced as *wǔ gù*. 《确》 pronounced as *kǔ jiǎo*. 《纤介》 pronounced as *xiān jiè*.

**Annotation (7):**
Things come of themselves; the perfectly tranquil have no inclination to engage with them.

**Exegesis:**
Abiding in their nature, their spirit soars, unentangled with things. Without need or expectation, this is the perfection of tranquility.

**Annotation (8):**
If tainted by turbid desires, there will be resistance.

**Exegesis:**
Their wisdom shines with clarity, perfectly pure and undefiled. Thus they harmonize with the myriad things and accord with all beings. This discussion of *忤* ("resistance") and *逆* ("opposition") reveals the same principle, illustrating the two aspects of emptiness and purity—hence the repetition.

**Annotation (9):**
All things have their proper measure; it must not be lost.

**Exegesis:**
The body and spirit are endowed with limits, yet their employment knows no bounds—this must lead to death. To labor the body beyond its measure without rest is to invite exhaustion. To pursue things with the spirit without cessation is to invite weariness; weary, the essence and *qi* wither and perish.

**Collation Note:**
(1) The Tang manuscript includes the character *也* after *邪*, *过*, and *失*.

The nature of water is such that, undefiled, it is clear; undisturbed, it is level. Obstructed and confined, it cannot flow, nor can it remain clear. This is the image of heaven’s *virtue*.

**Annotation (1):**
This is the image of heaven’s *virtue*—unintentional yet perfectly attuned.

**Exegesis:**
*象* means to emulate. Water’s nature is clarity and levelness, reflecting all things. If it is mixed and defiled, obstructed and confined, it strays from its constant nature, unable to ripple or flow, nor to reflect things. Only when undisturbed and unobstructed can it remain clear and level, illuminating all impartially as a standard for things. This is the image of heaven’s *virtue*. By analogy, the sage’s mind is luminous and pure, reflecting all without partiality, emulating the natural and uniting in *virtue* with the mysterious heavens. Thus the *Laozi* says, "The highest good is like water."

Thus it is said:
Pure and undefiled,
Still and unchanging,
Tranquil and inactive,
Moving in accord with heaven’s course—
This is the Dao of nurturing the spirit.

The sword of Gan and Yue is treasured in a case, never dared to be used—such is its supreme value.

The spirit flows in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit. Above, it touches heaven; below, it coils upon the earth. Transforming and nurturing the myriad things, it cannot be represented in form—its name is "united with the Emperor."

**Annotation (1):**
To emulate heaven’s *virtue* is to be without intention yet perfectly attuned.

**Annotation (2):**
Nothing is not in perfect accord.

**Exegesis:**
Though they harmonize their light with the dust, their spirit remains concentrated and profound. This further explains the earlier statement, "their spirit is pure."

**Annotation (3):**
Ever abiding in what is proper.

Though a thousand transformations unfold,
the heart remains ever still and one.
This further explains "one and unchanging."

**Annotation (4):**
It is simply to be in perfect accord with all things.

Though they mingle with the world and stir its waves,
they do not hinder their emptiness and tranquility.
In their dealings with things,
they do not abandon non-action.
This explains the earlier "perfect tranquility."

**Annotation (5):**
To move in pursuit of desire is the way of men.

Moved by things yet responding without intention,
they align with heaven’s course—
spontaneously generating the myriad things without intention.

**Exegesis (6):**
To summarize the preceding:
the movement of heaven and such principles
are the arts of governing the body,
the Dao of nurturing the spirit.

**Annotation (7):**
How much less would one dare to lightly use their spirit!

**Exegesis:**
*Gan* is the name of a stream;
*Yue*, the name of a mountain.
Both Gan Stream and Yue Mountain produce fine swords.
Another account states:
*Gan* refers to Wu.
Thus, the two states of Wu and Yue both produced famous swords,
and so they are named after them.
Now, if one possesses such a treasure sword from Wu and Yue,
it is kept in a case and stored away.
Only in the gravest matters of state would one dare to use it.
Such is the reverence with which it is treasured—
how much more so for one who treasures and cherishes their spirit!

**Textual Note:**
*Gan-Yue Swords*—Sima Biao: *Gan* refers to Wu. Wu and Yue produce fine swords.
Li Yi: Gan Stream and Yue Mountain yield famous swords.
Note: Wu has a stream called Gan Stream; Yue has a mountain called Ruoye,
both of which produce fine iron used to forge renowned swords.
◎Qingfan’s note—Wang Niansun: *Gan-Yue* is equivalent to *Wu-Yue*.
In the *Book of Han*, *Bi-Rong* and *Rong-Di* are said to be as distinct from *Yu-Yue* as can be.
*Yu* is a corruption of *Gan*.
*Gan* and *Yue* are both state names, hence the phrase *Rong-Di* and *Gan-Yue*.
Yan Shigu took *Yu-Yue* as the *Yu-Yue* of the Spring and Autumn period,
further corrupting *Yu* into *Yu*.
The correct interpretation follows Sima Biao.
(*Huainanzi*’s *Yuan Dao* chapter: *Gan-Yue* produce *ge-chi* cloth.
Gao You’s commentary: *Gan* refers to Wu.
Liu’s edition emends *Gan* to *Yu*, stating: *Yu-Yue*, also written as *Yu-Yue*—incorrect.)
*In a case*—*xia*, pronounced *hu* (户) *jia* (甲).

**Annotation (8):**
One who embodies the ultimate of heaven and earth,
responding to the measures of the myriad things with their spirit,
is thus.
If one achieves such merit as to surpass heaven and earth,
it is simply by following heaven’s course—
not by lightly using it.

**Exegesis:**
*Flows*—pervades.
One who cherishes and nurtures their spirit
can thus reach the four directions, flowing without obstruction.
Below, it coils upon the thick earth;
above, it extends to the dark heavens.
In the four directions and above and below,
there is nowhere it does not reach.
Though it moves, it remains ever still—
not one who lightly uses it.

**Textual Note:**
*Coils below*—*pan*, pronounced *pan* (盘); Guo: *fan* (烦).

**Annotation (9):**
What it nurtures has no fixed direction.

**Exegesis:**
Transforming and guiding the people,
embracing and nurturing the myriad things,
it responds to circumstances without clinging to one direction—
thus, it cannot be confined by form or image.

**Annotation (10):**
In accord with the Heavenly Emperor’s non-action.

**Exegesis:**
*Emperor*—to examine.
To summarize the preceding:
this is the Dao of examining reality.
Also: in accord with the Heavenly Emperor’s non-action.

The Dao of pure simplicity guards only the spirit.
Guard it and do not lose it, and you become one with the spirit.
The essence of this oneness penetrates, aligning with heaven’s order.

A rustic saying goes:
“The common people value profit,
the upright value reputation,
the worthy esteem aspiration,
the sages treasure essence.”
Thus, *simplicity* means having nothing mixed with it;
*purity* means not diminishing one’s spirit.

One who embodies pure simplicity is called a *true person*.

**Annotation (1):**
Always guarding the utmost stillness with pure simplicity,
never swayed by externals—this is darkness.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao of pure essence and simple substance lies solely in guarding the spirit.
Guard the spirit without losing it,
and the spirit congeals in stillness—
the body becomes like withered wood,
the heart like dead ashes,
self and things both forgotten,
body and spirit as one.

**Annotation (2):**
Essence is the true nature of things.

**Exegesis:**
*Order*—principle.
Having become one with the spirit,
essence and wisdom are unimpeded—
thus, it merges with the principle of spontaneity.

**Annotation (3):**
To be one with the spirit is not merely to guard the spirit;
to not stray from one’s essence is not merely to treasure essence.
Yet in practice, one treasures and guards it.

**Exegesis:**
Zhuangzi sought to measure people,
whose aspirations differ,
so he broadly outlined four categories,
using rustic sayings to illustrate that words lack fixed reference.
The common multitude, bound by worldly customs, all value wealth and profit—
such are the followers of Robber Zhi.
The pure and upright value reputation—
such are Boyi and Jie Zitui.
The worthy and noble esteem lofty aspirations,
unbowed by the world—
such are Xu You and Zizhou Zhibo.
Only the sage who embodies the Dao,
free from partiality,
can treasure their spirit without being swayed by things.
Though they respond to change and follow the times,
they never lose their pure simplicity.

**Annotation (4):**
If purity means not diminishing,
then even if a hundred deeds are performed in unison,
ten thousand changes are encompassed—
this is the utmost purity.
If simplicity means not mixing,
then even if adorned with dragon patterns and phoenix forms,
radiant with extraordinary splendor—
this is the utmost simplicity.
But if one cannot preserve their natural substance
and mixes it with external adornments,
then even the hide of dogs and sheep—
how can it be called pure and simple?

The one who mingles with worldly things yet remains untainted by them—this is the utmost simplicity. The one who moves amid the clamor of dust and change yet suffers no loss to their spirit—this is the utmost purity. How could purity and simplicity be claimed only by those who stand alone atop lofty mountains or fold their hands in the stillness of forest whispers? Surely this is not so! This concludes the explication of the meaning of purity and simplicity.

---

To embody is to awaken and comprehend. Those who profoundly align with the principle of purity and simplicity find the true Dao wherever they are—thus they may be called people who have attained the true Dao.

**External Chapters: "Mending Nature" (Chapter Sixteen)**

This chapter is named for its theme.

To mend one’s nature through worldly customs is to seek, through worldly learning, the restoration of one’s original state. To disturb desire through worldly customs is to strive, through thought, to attain clarity. These are called the people of obscured darkness.

**Annotation (1):**
Having already mended one’s nature through worldly means, to then seek the restoration of life’s root through worldly learning—this is to pursue it by ever more mistaken paths.

**Commentary:**
To mend is to cultivate. Nature is life. Customs are habits. The original is the root. People receive their nature from the natural, each guarding their allotted portion of life. Following it as it is naturally leads one to accord with principle. Yet now they are habituated to artificial laws and cultivate their true nature, straining and forcing it—already exhausted and worn. Then they further practice the worldly learning of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom to seek the return to their original nature. Thus, the more they grasp at customs, the more they lose their nature; the closer they draw to learning, the farther they stray from the Dao.

**Philological Notes:**
*Mend* (缮): read as *shàn*; Cui [Yun] says: to cultivate. Another says: to refine.
*Nature* (性): nature, the root.

**Annotation (2):**
Having already disturbed their mind with desires, to then labor thought in pursuit of clarity—this only deepens the loss the more one strives.

**Commentary:**
To disturb is to disorder. To attain is to obtain. Desire refers to things like fame, profit, sensual pleasures—objects of craving. People’s minds become dim and disordered because they covet such worldly desires. Now, if they still employ discriminating thought and deliberate study, hoping to gain the Dao of luminous clarity, it is impossible. Only by learning without learning can one return to the root; by thinking without thinking can one attain clarity. Some versions read *to disturb desire through desire*.

**Philological Notes:**
*Disturb* (滑): read as *gǔ*, to disorder. Cui [Yun] says: to cultivate.
◎ Yu Yue says: The *Philological Notes* read *disturb* as *gǔ*, to disorder; Cui [Yun] says: to cultivate. The latter interpretation is superior. The preceding line reads *to mend one’s nature through worldly customs to seek the restoration of one’s original state*, and Cui’s commentary also glosses *mend* as to cultivate. The two lines share a single meaning: *mend* and *disturb* both mean to cultivate, hence *to seek the restoration of one’s original state* and *to attain clarity*. If *disturb* were glossed as to disorder, it would not cohere with the meaning of *seek*. *Disturb* can be glossed as to cultivate because *disturb* (滑) is akin to *gǔ* (汨). The *Shuowen*’s Water section: *gǔ* (汨) means to regulate water—this is its meaning. The *Yupian*’s Hand section: *hú* (抇) is also the character *gǔ* (搰). Thus, *disturb* (滑) and *gǔ* (汨) are like *gǔ* (搰) and *hú* (抇).
*Strive through thought* (思以): Li [Xi] reads as *sī yǐ*. The annotation also reads *labor thought*.
*Then further* (方复): read as *fú yòu*.

**Annotation (3):**
As for those who seek to dispel darkness, they must first depart from worldly customs and abandon desire before approaching the threshold.

**Commentary:**
To obscure is to block. Darkness is dimness. This concludes the preceding discussion. Those who seek the root through worldly learning and clarity through thought—such people may be called the obscured and darkened.

**Philological Notes:**
*Must depart* (必离): read as *lì zhì*.
*Abandon desire* (去欲): read as *qǔ lǚ*.

**Textual Collation:**
(1) *Quewu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, where the character after *worldly* (俗) is missing.
(2) *Quewu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, where *worldly* (俗) is written as *desire* (欲).

---

Those in antiquity who cultivated the Dao did so by nurturing knowledge with tranquility. Knowledge arises, yet they do not employ knowledge—this is called nurturing tranquility with knowledge. Knowledge and tranquility nourish each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature.

Virtue is harmony; the Dao is principle. Virtue leaves nothing unaccommodated—this is benevolence. The Dao leaves nothing unprincipled—this is righteousness. Righteousness is manifest, and things draw near—this is loyalty. Centered in pure substance and returning to emotion—this is joy. Trust in conduct, accommodating form, and following pattern—this is ritual. When ritual and joy are universally practiced, the world falls into chaos. If one rectifies others while obscuring their own virtue, virtue will not be overbearing. If it becomes overbearing, things will inevitably lose their nature.

**Annotation (1):**
Only through tranquility does knowledge not stray; only when knowledge does not stray is one’s nature not lost.

**Commentary:**
Tranquility is stillness. In antiquity, sages who governed themselves and the state through the Dao necessarily nurtured true knowledge with the method of tranquility, preventing it from straying outward.

**Philological Notes:**
*Cultivated the Dao* (治道): read as written, or as *zhí lì*.
*Nurturing knowledge* (养知): read as *yǎng zhì*. Below, interpret accordingly.

**Annotation (2):**
Not employing knowledge but allowing it to know on its own—though it may comprehend the myriad things, it remains serene and self-content.

**Commentary:**
To follow one’s nature in illumination is the arising of knowledge. To know without intent is not to employ knowledge. To proceed with knowledge without contrivance—this is to know without knowing, to be knowledgeable yet without knowledge, not the kind of knowing that knows through knowledge.

Thus, one may know throughout the day yet never have known, and never have failed to know; act throughout the day yet never have acted, and never have failed to act—ever nurturing this true knowledge with tranquility. If not thus, how could one be tranquil?

**Annotation (3):**
To know without acting harms not tranquility; to be tranquil yet act of itself harms not knowledge—this may be called mutual nurturance. When the two nurture each other mutually, how could the harmony of principle arise from elsewhere?

**Commentary:**
If one cannot be tranquil, how could that true knowledge arise? Without true knowledge, how could this tranquility be attained? Thus, tranquility arises from knowledge, enabling stillness; knowledge draws from stillness, attaining true knowledge. Therefore, knowledge and tranquility nurture each other mutually. This is the Dao of central harmony, residing within the heart’s inch, the principle of spontaneity issuing from Heavenly nature—it lies within oneself, how could it relate to others?

**Annotation (4):**
Harmony, thus nothing is not attained; the Dao, thus nothing is not ordered.

**Commentary:**
Virtue extends to others, hence central harmony is its meaning; principle pervades things, hence the Great Dao is its name.

**Annotation (5):**
That which admits all without exclusion is not acting as benevolence, yet the traces of benevolence proceed therein.

**Commentary:**
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching, embracing all without exception; its vast and boundless compassion and love manifest the traces of benevolence.

**Annotation (6):**
That which orders all without fail is not acting as righteousness, yet the efficacy of righteousness is evident therein.

**Commentary:**
The Dao can penetrate things, each thing accorded its principle; principle being fitting, the efficacy of righteousness is evident.

**Annotation (7):**
If righteousness is manifest yet not rooted in loyalty, things grow ever more distant.

**Commentary:**
When the principles of righteousness are clear and emotions flow from the center, without affectation, things naturally draw near.

**Annotation (8):**
When benevolence and righteousness arise from within and return to rest in the original disposition, the will is fulfilled—fulfilled, its traces are joy.

**Commentary:**
Since benevolence and righteousness proceed from within, the will and nature remain pure and true. Though one may engage with the world’s conditions, the heart ever returns to true feeling; the attainment of harmony and ease is called joy.

**Philological Notes:**
*Joy* (樂也): read as *luò*. The annotation is the same.

**Annotation (9):**
Sincere conduct, dignified bearing, and compliance with the patterns of spontaneity—its traces are called propriety.

**Commentary:**
When sincere conduct is manifest and demeanor accords with things without transgressing patterns, its traces are called propriety.

**Philological Notes:**
*Sincere conduct* (信行): read as *xìn xíng*. The annotation is the same. Below, *conduct* (行), *minor conduct* (小行), *conducting* (注行者), and *conduct established* (行立) follow this pattern.

**Annotation (10):**
To impose what one part alone treads, what one will alone delights in, upon the world—then one region gains while ten thousand regions lose.

**Commentary:**
Those who cannot empty the heart to respond to things but cling to traces to govern the world will surely be mired in the ornamented rites and drowned in wanton pleasures. Thus, when straw dogs are set out again, the world falls into chaos.

**Philological Notes:**
*Everywhere* (遍): read as *biàn*. ◎ Yu Yue notes: Guo’s annotation states, "To impose what one part alone treads, what one will alone delights in, upon the world—then one region gains while ten thousand regions lose." This refers to partiality as one-sided partiality, hence Guo explains it with "one part" and "one will." The *Philological Notes* render it as *everywhere* and read it as *biàn*, which is incorrect.

**Annotation (11):**
Each rectifying its nature and destiny and veiling itself in its own virtue does not impose this upon that. If one imposes this upon that, how could one not lose one’s nature?

**Commentary:**
*Veiling* (蒙) means obscurity; *imposing* (冒) means disorder. *That* refers to the sage who treads the true Dao. If one must impose disorder, then self and others lose their nature. ◎ Jia Shifu notes: Virtue suffices to rectify things, yet it humbly allows things to follow their spontaneity and veils itself in virtue, never forcing the world with virtue to impose upon it. To force the world and impose upon it is to rectify oneself but not allow things to rectify themselves—thus, things lose their nature in great number.

**Philological Notes:**
*Not imposing* (不冒): read as *mò bào*. Cui notes: *covering*.

**Textual Variants:**
(1) *Omissions and Errors* lacks the character *know*; Zhang Junfang’s edition adds a *know* after *know*, and all *know* in the passage are written as *knowledge*.
(2) *Omissions and Errors* has *loyalty* as *center*; Zhang Junfang’s edition reads *loyalty*.
(3) *Omissions and Errors* has *partial*; the Jiangnan ancient manuscript reads *partial* as *everywhere*.

In ancient times, people dwelt amid primal chaos, attaining equanimity with their age.

At that time, yin and yang harmonized in stillness, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, the multitude of beings did not die young, and though humans possessed knowledge, there was no use for it—this was called perfect unity. At that time, none acted, yet all was ever spontaneous.

**Commentary (1):**
This refers to the rulers before the Three Sovereigns, the nameless lords of remote antiquity. In that era, the pure wind had not yet dispersed, so they dwelt amid undifferentiated chaos and obscurity, becoming one with their age. Profoundly without trace, ruler and minister, high and low did not interact, all attaining the Dao of tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action.

**Philological Notes:**
*Amid chaos* (在混): read as *hùn*. *Obscurity* (芒): read as *máng*. Cui notes: *Hùnhùn mángmáng* refers to the time before division. *Indifference* (澹): read as *dàn*.

**Annotation (2):**
Simply following its spontaneity.

**Commentary (2):**
In that chaotic time, that age of simplicity, the whole world was tranquil and content, embodying non-action. Thus, yin ascended and yang descended, the two qi harmonized in stillness and peace; ghosts were hidden and humans manifest, each keeping to its place without disturbance.

Heat and cold followed their sequence, the four seasons kept their rhythm; with no disasters or calamities, the myriad things remained unharmed, and all living beings fulfilled their natural lifespans, none cut short by premature death. Though humans possessed the art of knowledge and discernment, they practiced non-action, and thus had no use for it.

When all things were spontaneous, they attained perfect unity. Equalizing self and other in non-action, blending right and wrong in tranquility and indifference, with no division between things and self—this was called perfect unity. *Mo* means "none." Acting without acting, this was non-action; not knowing why things were so yet finding them so—this was spontaneity. Thus, in that age, humans embraced the virtue of non-action, and all things embodied the Dao of spontaneity.

When virtue later declined, and Suiren and Fuxi first ruled the world, they followed the times but failed to achieve unity. As virtue declined further, and Shennong and the Yellow Emperor first ruled the world, they brought stability but not harmony. When virtue declined still further, and Yao and Shun first ruled the world, they initiated the currents of governance and culture, diluting purity and scattering simplicity. They departed from the Dao in pursuit of goodness, and acted with perilous virtue. Then, abandoning their nature, they followed the heart-mind. Heart-minds, with their knowledge and discernment, proved insufficient to settle the world. Thus, they adorned governance with ornamentation and expanded it with erudition. Ornamentation effaced substance, and erudition drowned the heart-mind. Only then did the people begin to grow confused and disordered, unable to return to their original nature and recover their primal state.

The decline of virtue occurred because sages did not succeed one another; those in power could not practice non-action and instead coveted the traces of non-action, leading to these ills. Once the world had lost unity, confusion became insoluble, so they relinquished effort and merely followed the times. They sought stability in what was stable, and nothing more. As virtue further declined, the ills grew graver. Thus, Shennong waged war against Gonggong, and the Yellow Emperor battled Chiyou; ominous forces did not cease, and warfare arose repeatedly. They sought only to punish the violent and eliminate the cruel, to console the people and condemn wrongdoing—merely striving to stabilize the world, yet unable to bring harmony to all living beings.

Sages have no fixed intentions; they allow the world to achieve its own spontaneity. Whether its achievements are pure or thin is not the sage’s doing. The sage can only allow the world to attain its own fulfillment—how could the world attain the sage? Thus, the traces of emperors and kings shift with the times, yet the Dao of the sage remains ever whole. Yao and Shun, at the end of the Five Emperors and the beginning of the Three Kings, initiated governance and culture, establishing the Five Constants to regulate the five phases and appointing officials to govern the people. The people, influenced by this, grew cunning and deceitful, and the five phases fell into neglect and peril. Branching currents and divergent streams persist to this day—was this not the result of destroying simplicity to create artifice, scattering purity to fabricate falsity?

The Dao of emptiness and penetration transcends both good and evil. Yet they abandoned their own nature to imitate others, striving for reputation and pursuing goodness. Goodness, once it departs from principle, is called "departure." *Xing* means acting contrary to one’s nature; thus, actions were established, but virtue was not preserved. *Xian* means perilous and obstructed. Unable to follow their nature and act with authenticity, concealing their traces, they instead feigned emotions and established conduct to seek fame. In truth, external conduct and superficial fame were hollow, causing inner virtue to become perilous—how could it remain pure and unblemished?

）This stems from the very same root.

【7】
**Commentary:** When the heart enslaves itself, nature departs.
**Subcommentary:** Abandoning the Dao of emptiness and penetration, forsaking the virtue of purity and harmony, they then leave behind their natural nature and follow the heart of discrimination.

【8】
**Commentary:** The hearts of self and others vie to be the first to know, no longer allowing nature to take its course.
**Subcommentary:** The hearts of self and others scheme against one another, competing in judgments of right and wrong, good and bad, striving to be the first to know.
**Exegetical Note:** *"Heart and heart-knowledge"* (心与心识) is read as written. All editions agree. Xiang Xiu’s version reads *zhí* (职), stating: *"The hearts of self and others vie to be the first in duty."* Since Guo Xiang’s commentary matches Xiang’s, it should also read *zhí*.
**Jia Shifu’s Note:** Guo Xiang says, *"The hearts of self and others vie to be the first to know, no longer allowing nature to take its course."* All editions punctuate *"heart and heart-knowledge"* as a phrase. Xiang Xiu’s version reads *zhí*, stating: *"The hearts of self and others vie to be the first in duty."* I suspect that *"heart and heart"* does not mean self and others possess different hearts, but that the heart itself is divided. The original heart is one, yet the heart that is drawn into motion is another. When drawn into motion, a single thought awakens and gives rise to *shí* (识, recognition)—in winter, it recognizes cold; in summer, it recognizes warmth. From this awakening, intention arises and gives rise to *zhī* (知, knowledge)—when eating, it seeks sweetness; when dressing, it seeks warmth. Buddhist thought distinguishes *manas-vijñāna* (mind-consciousness) into two realms. *Zhī* (knowledge) is the emanation of intention, hence the saying: *"Not recognizing, not knowing, following the decree of Heaven."* *Shí* (recognition) is the inner luminosity of the heart; *zhī* (knowledge) is the outward reach of the heart. When recognition and knowledge arise together, chaos proliferates—how can they suffice to bring stability to the world!

**Yu Yue’s Note:** The characters *shí* (识) and *zhī* (知) appear in sequence. The *Book of Songs* says, *"Not recognizing, not knowing,"* where *shí* and *zhī* share the same meaning, hence they are joined as *shízhī* (识知). If the heart relies on recognition and knowledge, it cannot stabilize the world, making it clear that only by being *"not recognizing, not knowing"* can stability be spoken of. All other scholars punctuate after *shí* (识), which is incorrect; Xiang Xiu’s version reading *zhí* (职) is even more mistaken.

【9】
**Commentary:** To forget knowledge and follow nature—this is true stability.
**Subcommentary:** When the heart clings to the realm of existence and knowledge discriminates without bound, the six directions become smoke and dust, the eight wilds surge and boil. The four seasons fall into disorder, the three luminaries erupt in comets. This is the source of calamity and chaos—how can it suffice to stabilize the world!

【10】
**Commentary:** Erudition is the ornament of the heart’s substance.
**Subcommentary:** Having already shown that the heart’s operation through knowledge cannot stabilize the world, they later relied on texts and learning to rectify the times, multiplying scholarship to aid the age. They did not know that substance is the root of refinement, and that literary embellishment obscures plain substance; that breadth is the branch of the heart, and that extensive learning drowns the heart’s spirit. Only by cutting off learning and discarding refinement can one attain the beauty of non-action.
**Exegetical Note:** *"Drowned in learning"* (博溺) is read *nàilì* (乃沥), while Guo reads *nùxué* (奴学).

【11】
**Commentary:** *Chu* (初) refers to the root of nature and destiny.
**Subcommentary:** When literary refinement obscures plain substance and extensive learning drowns the heart’s spirit, the foolish masses become the origin of chaos. Can one then return to the tranquility of their original nature and restore their natural primordial root? Alas! The fault lies in the heart’s knowledge and erudition!
**Textual Note:** (1) The *Shide Tang* edition has a lacuna. (2) *"Obscures"* (隐) is supplied based on the preceding subcommentary.

From this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world. World and Dao mutually lose one another. 【1】How can the person of the Dao arise in the world, and how can the world arise in the Dao? 【2】If the Dao cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Dao, even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, their virtue is concealed. 【3】

【1】
**Commentary:** The Dao endures in the world because it is not prized. Yet if the world endures, it will prize the Dao, and in prizing it, the Dao is lost. The Dao cannot prevent the world from prizing it, nor can the world avoid prizing the Dao—thus they mutually lose one another.
**Subcommentary:** *Sang* (丧) means to abandon. Observing the traces of events, we know that the frivolous age has discarded the Dao of non-action, just as the Dao of non-action has abandoned the age of purity and harmony. Thus, world and Dao mutually lose one another.
**Exegetical Note:** *"World loses"* (世丧) is read *xīlàng* (息浪). The same applies to the following instances and in the commentary.
**Qing Fan’s Note:** The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Jiang Yan’s *"Miscellaneous Styles"* poem cites Sima Biao: *"The world is full of heterodoxies that lose the Dao; the Dao does not favor the world, hence it is said to be lost."* The *Exegetical Note* omits this.

【2】
**Commentary:** If it is not prized, then they mutually arise.
**Subcommentary:** Therefore, the sage who embraces the Dao withdraws from the dusty world, unwilling to promote and govern the age. And how could the frivolous and artificial world inspire the sagely Dao!

【3】
**Commentary:** The reason they do not conceal themselves now is that they have feelings that give rise to action. How do they arise? By not being prized.
**Subcommentary:** In this degenerate age, the Dao cannot be employed, and the Dao of non-action no longer operates in the world. Even if a sage embodying the Dao descends into the mortal realm, blending with the masses, unknown to all, concealing their sagely virtue so that none can employ them—though dwelling in the marketplace, how would it differ from the mountains and forests? Thus, they are concealed, yet do not conceal themselves.

【1】
The so-called recluses of old did not hide their bodies to avoid being seen, nor seal their words to avoid speaking, nor conceal their wisdom to avoid expressing it—their time and destiny were greatly awry.

【2】
When time and destiny align and their Way flourishes throughout the world,

【3】
they return to unity without a trace.

When time and destiny do not align and their Way is greatly obstructed throughout the world,

they deepen their roots and stabilize their utmost essence to await their time—this is the Dao of preserving the self.

**Subcommentary [1]:** As for those who conceal themselves while still employing things, the Dao and the world would rise in mutual contention—what concealment would there be?

**Subcommentary:** In times of chaos and disorder, the sagely Dao cannot be enacted—how could this be a matter of concealing one’s brilliance or hiding one’s virtue?

**Annotation [2]:** None know to return to unity to still their traces, yet they pursue traces to seek unity. The more they attain traces, the more they lose unity—this is the height of delusion. Though they may rise to clarify it, open their words to express it, or display their wisdom to reveal it, how could mutual contention arise? It only leads to mutual loss.

**Subcommentary:** "Delusion" means false and deceitful. They do not hide their bodies to avoid being seen—though seen, they do not disrupt the multitude. They do not seal their words to avoid speaking—though spoken, they do not offend others. They do not conceal their wisdom to avoid expressing it—though expressed, they do not confuse. Yet when time and destiny are deluded and their fate meets with adversity, they follow the world’s rise and fall, preserving themselves and avoiding harm.

**Exegetical Note:** *Fújiàn* (弗見): read as *xiánbiànfǎn* (賢遍反). *Zhīsuǒ* (祇所): pronounced *zhī* (支).

**Annotation [3]:** This is a time of tranquility and indifference.

**Annotation [4]:** Returning to the nature of things, their nature unifies of itself—thus, no traces remain.

**Subcommentary:** When time aligns with the Dao and destiny belongs to clarity and peace, they propagate virtue and spread transformation, their Way flourishing throughout the world. Thereafter, each person returns to unity, every thing reverts to its root—self and other merge in darkness, leaving no sign or trace.

**Annotation [5]:** This is a time incapable of tranquility and indifference.

**Annotation [6]:** Though it be an age of affairs, the sage has never not been tranquil and indifferent. Thus, they deepen their roots and stabilize their utmost essence, awaiting things to unfold of themselves—this is how the Dao is never lost.

**Subcommentary:** When time encounters the absence of the Dao and destiny meets with excess and dissipation, their virtuous transformation cannot be enacted, and their Way is greatly obstructed throughout the world. Thereafter, they firmly secure their natural foundation, safeguarding and stabilizing their utmost nature, calmly adapting to change, abiding in constancy while awaiting the end of the age—how could there be any question of success or failure, fortune or misfortune in their midst?

**Annotation [7]:** There has never been a case where the self was preserved yet the world did not flourish.

**Subcommentary:** Abiding in obstruction yet ever joyful, dwelling in peril yet at peace, following the times in action or concealment—this may be called the Dao of preserving the self. The ancients who practiced preserving the self did not adorn their wisdom with eloquence, did not use their wisdom to obstruct the world, did not use their wisdom to obstruct virtue. Solemnly abiding in what is proper and returning to their nature—what more was there to do?

The Dao is fundamentally not a minor practice; virtue is fundamentally not a minor understanding. Minor understanding harms virtue; minor practice harms the Dao. Thus, it is said: rectify the self and that is all. To delight in wholeness is called attaining one’s aspiration.

**Annotation [1]:** Simply follow their true wisdom and that is all.

**Exegesis:** The ancients valued simplicity over eloquence and prized action above speech. Thus, those among the ancients who entrusted themselves to their own conduct would never employ florid rhetoric or adorn discriminating minor wisdom.

**Annotation [2]:** This is the sentiment of serene detachment.
**Exegesis:** "Obstruction" here means entanglement and encumbrance—refraining from unleashing the poison of knowledge to afflict and distress the common people.
**Phonetic Gloss:** *Dàn* (淡) reads as in *dàzhàn* (大暫). *Bó* (泊) is pronounced as *bó* (薄).
**Annotation [3]:** Simply guard one’s inherent virtue.
**Exegesis:** Knowing the limits of one’s allotment, one does not burden one’s self-possession with boundless pursuits.
**Annotation [4]:** *Wēirán* (危然) describes a solitary and upright bearing.
**Exegesis:** *Wēi* (危) means "solitary." To dwell alone amid a chaotic world, abiding in peril yet ever at peace, moving without disturbing stillness—constantly returning to one’s natural nature, acting in accord with it—what more is there to do? This expresses the state of non-action.
**Phonetic Gloss:** *Wēirán* (危然) is read as written. Guo [Xiang] says: "a solitary and upright bearing." Sima’s edition reads *dúlì* (独立), meaning "independent bearing." Cui’s edition reads *guǐ* (垝), pronounced like *guǐ* (垝) in *lěiguǐ* (累垝). *Guǐrán* (垝然) describes a self-sustaining and steadfast demeanor.
**Annotation [5]:** Roaming the level path.
**Exegesis:** The great Dao is vast and unobstructed, encompassing all things. Partial attainment obscures the Dao—thus, it is fundamentally not a minor practice.
**Phonetic Gloss:** *Yú tǎn* (于坦) reads as in *chìdàn* (敕但).
**Annotation [6]:** Vast and utterly unobstructed.
**Exegesis:** The person of supreme virtue, whose wisdom pervades the myriad things, would never fixate on right and wrong to make discriminations.
**Phonetic Gloss:** *Kuàirán* (块然) reads as in *kǔduì* (苦對).
**Exegesis:** Minor understanding and petty knowledge diminish the profound and mysterious abundance of virtue; petty learning and trivial conduct injure the vast and unobstructed great Dao.
**Annotation [8]:** To attain one’s aspiration is to be content in one’s heart, solitary and level, free from the emotions of sorrow or joy—this is the wholeness of joy.
**Exegesis:** When one’s self walks the upright Way, all one’s actions become effortlessly unobstructed. Without compliance or resistance, forgetting sorrow and joy, all one’s undertakings are fitting—this is the wholeness of joy. Only when joy is whole does one’s nature and aspiration find fulfillment.
**Phonetic Gloss:** *Lèquán* (樂全) is pronounced as *luò* (洛). The same applies below.
**Textual Note:**
(1) The *Shide Tang* edition reads *cún* (存) instead of *xíng* (行).
(2) The *Quewu* edition cites Zhang Junfang’s text as including *hū* (乎) below.
(3) "The wholeness of joy" follows the annotation in emending the text.

What the ancients called "attaining one’s aspiration" did not refer to carriages and caps of office, but rather to having nothing to add to one’s joy.
What the present age calls "attaining one’s aspiration" refers to carriages and caps of office.
Carriages and caps of office are not part of one’s nature and destiny; they are things that come fortuitously, like lodging. When they lodge with one, their coming cannot be warded off, and their going cannot be halted. Thus, one does not indulge one’s aspirations for carriages and caps, nor does one follow worldly customs in poverty and hardship. Joy is the same in both cases—thus, one is simply without sorrow. Now, if the lodging departs and one is no longer joyful, then from this we may see that even when there was joy, it was not without distraction. Therefore, it is said: those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to customs are called "inverted people."

**Annotation [1]:** To be complete within and sufficient.
**Exegesis:** "To add" means to augment.

Carriages are called *xuan*; caps of office are called *mian*. The ancients were simple and unadorned, embodying the Dao and practicing non-action. Their fulfillment lay in tranquility, and their joy did not depend on carriages and caps. Joy was sufficient in itself—how could it require augmentation?

**Exegesis:** People of the present age are mostly frivolous and superficial. They covet glory and rank, relying on these to satisfy their hearts. Thus, they wear caps of office and ride in carriages, considering this the realization of their ambitions.

**Exegesis:** "Fortuitous" refers to what comes unexpectedly. Carriages, caps, and worldly splendor are external things. What comes fortuitously is not part of one’s nature or destiny—it merely lodges temporarily. How could it endure?

**Annotation:** *Tanglai* (傥来): read as *tudang*. Cui’s edition writes *dang* (党), glossing it as "multitude." **Editor’s Note:** Cui’s edition writes *dang* for *tang*; *dang* is an ancient form of *tang*. *Dang* conveys contingency, as in the *Records of the Grand Historian* (*Biography of Han Xin*): "fearing his *dang* (party) would not comply," and the *Book of Han* (*Biography of Wu Bei*): "*Dang* (contingency) may bring unexpected fortune." Both instances equate *dang* with *tang*. In the *Xunzi* ("Discourse on Heaven"), "when strange stars *dang* (contingently) appear," Yang’s commentary glosses *dang* as "frequent," but Wang Niansun argues this lacks ancient basis. Hui Dingyu’s *Nine Classics: Ancient Meanings* says: "*Dangjian* (党见) means 'what is seen.'" To gloss *dang* as "what" follows the *Gongyang Commentary*, though this seems imprecise. Cui’s gloss of *dang* as "multitude" is particularly misguided.

**Annotation:** These are external things; their gain or loss does not pertain to the self.

**Exegesis:** When fortune comes fortuitously, one accepts carriages and caps as if drifting; when destiny departs like a lodger, one relinquishes splendor with equanimity. Since one has no desire to resist, how could there be any attachment to retaining them?

**Annotation:** *Keyu* (可圉): read as *yulü*; also written as *keyu* (可御).

**Annotation:** *Buwei* (不为): read as *yuwei*. The same below.

**Annotation:** Serene and self-possessed, one remains unaware of the lodging upon the self.

**Annotation:** Vast and self-content, one remains unaware of poverty upon the self.

**Exegesis:** *Si* means "to extend"; *qu* means "to vie." The ancients understood that prosperity and adversity were matters of destiny, and that glory and decay were not their own. Even if carriages and caps came their way, these were insufficient to extend their aspirations; even in straitened circumstances, they did not vie with the clamor of worldly customs.

**Annotation:** "That" and "this" refer to carriages and caps versus poverty and hardship.

**Exegesis:** "That" refers to carriages and caps; "this" refers to poverty and hardship. Both carriages and poverty are fortuitous; if one rejoices in the former, one must also delight in the latter. Since both are merely lodgings, they are the same.

**Annotation:** Nor is there joy or elation.

**Exegesis:** Neither carriages nor poverty bring joy or suffering. Accepting transformation as it comes, one is simply without sorrow.

**Annotation:** Those who are unhappy when the lodging departs were already distracted when it arrived—this is to exchange the inner for the outer.

**Exegesis:** People of the present age have shallow understanding. Thus, when things lodge with them, they rejoice; when things depart, they grieve. How can they not see that both states arise fortuitously? With lodging and departure come constant sorrow and joy—thus, even in joy, the heart is never free from distraction.

**Annotation:** Pursuing externals harms the inner; such a disposition is inverted.

**Exegesis:** With lodging and departure come alternating sorrow and joy. To lose oneself in things is to be utterly lost. Carriages and poverty alike belong to the dust of worldly custom. If one follows custom as the norm, one forfeits one’s nature, turns from truth, and strays from the Dao. Such a state of "settling" is truly inverted.

**Annotation:** Cui says: "to go against one’s nature and destiny is to be unaligned." Xiang says: "to exchange the outer for the inner is called inversion."

**Textual Note:**
(1) *Quewu* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, which includes the characters *zhi you* (之有) after *ming* (命).
(2) The character *zhi* (之) is amended to *shi* (是) following the Shidetang edition.

**Scroll 6 (Part 2) – Outer Chapters**
*Autumn Floods* (Chapter 17) / *Utmost Joy* (Chapter 18) / *Autumn Floods* (Chapter 17)

**Annotation:** The chapter takes its name from external things.

When the autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River. The current swells so vast that on either bank or between isles and shores, oxen and horses cannot be distinguished. Thereupon, the River Lord rejoiced, believing all the world’s beauty to be his alone. Following the current eastward, he reached the Northern Sea. Gazing east, he saw no end to the waters. Thereupon, the River Lord turned his face and, looking across the expanse toward Ruo, sighed: "There is a common saying: 'Those who hear a hundred teachings think none compare to themselves'—this describes me. Moreover, I once heard of those who belittled Confucius’s learning and disparaged Boyi’s righteousness, and I did not believe it. Now that I have witnessed the boundlessness of your waters, had I not come to your gate, I would have been in peril—I would have been forever ridiculed by those of great understanding."

**Annotation:** This speaks of its vastness.

The **Exegesis** states: The "River" refers to Meng Ford. *Jing* means "to flow through." *Si* means "bank." *Ya* means "shore." *Zhu* means "islet"—land in water suitable for habitation is called an islet. Great waters arise in spring and flourish in autumn. In the white autumn, yin *qi* grows fierce and abundant, often bringing prolonged rains, hence the waters rise in autumn. Thereafter, all the valleys and streams pour into the Yellow River, its currents flowing freely and filling to abundance. The waters swell vast, its banks stretching wide, its islets distant. Thus, gazing across the water, one cannot distinguish between oxen and horses.

**Explanation of Terms**:
*Qiu Shui* ("Autumn Waters"): Li [Yun] says: Waters arise in spring and strengthen in autumn.
*Baihu Tong* states: Water is level.
*Guan He* ("Pouring into the River"): Pronounced *guan* (ancient *luan* rhyme).
*Jing Liu* ("Flowing Through"): Pronounced *jing*. Sima [Biao] says: *Jing* means "to flow through." Cui [Zhuan] writes it as *jing* (path), meaning "to traverse directly." It is also written as *jing* (channel).
*Liang Si* ("Two Banks"): Pronounced *si*, meaning "shore."
*Zhu* ("Islet"): Sima [Biao] says: Land in water suitable for habitation is called an islet. *Shi Ming* states: *Zhu* means "to obstruct"—its body rises high, obstructing the water and causing it to flow around.
*Ya* ("Shore"): Also written as *ya* or *yá*, all equivalent.
*Bu Bian Niu Ma* ("Cannot Distinguish Oxen and Horses"): *Bian* means "to differentiate." The waters are so vast that distant objects cannot be discerned.

**Exegesis**:
The River Lord is the spirit of the Yellow River. His surname is Feng, given name Yi, a native of Tongti Village in Huayin. He attained the Dao of water immortality. As the river’s expanse grew vast, he rejoiced, believing all the world’s glory and splendor resided within himself.

**Explanation of Terms**:
*He Bo* ("River Lord"): Surname Feng, given name Yi, also called Bing Yi or Feng Chi, as previously noted in the *Da Zong Shi* chapter. Another account states: Surname Lü, given name Gongzi, with Feng Yi as his wife.
◎ Qingfan’s Note: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Mei Cheng’s *Qi Fa* cites Xu Shen: "Feng Chi is the River Lord." The *Explanation of Terms* states: The River Lord’s surname is Feng, given name Yi, also called Feng Chi. *Chi* and *yi* were interchangeable in ancient usage. The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su Xun* states: "Feng Yi attained the Dao and submerged himself in the great river." Xu’s commentary: "Feng Yi is the River Lord, a native of Tongxiang Village in Huayin. He ingested eight minerals and became a water immortal." The *Shi Jing*’s *Xiao Ya Si Mu* chapter reads *zhou dao wo yi* ("the Zhou road winds slowly"), while the *Han Shi* writes it as *wei yi*. Yan Zou’s *Kuangmiu Zhengsu* states: "Anciently, *chi* and *yi* were interchangeable—this is the evidence." Gao You’s commentary on the *Huainanzi*’s *Yuan Dao* chapter: "Feng Yi, also called Feng Chi, was an ancient adept who mastered yin and yang."
*Wei Jin* ("Believing All"): Pronounced *jin* (ancient *ren* rhyme).

**Exegesis**:
The "Northern Sea" refers to present-day Laizhou.

Gazing upon the ocean, one cannot discern clearly—water and sun reflect each other, hence "gazing upon the ocean." *Ruo* is the sea god.

The River Lord followed the current eastward until he reached the great sea. Casually glancing back, he saw no end or shore to the waters. Only then did he turn his face and gaze upward at Hai Ruo, sighing deeply with emotion, expressing his thoughts in rustic speech. Yet what he had heard was but one ten-thousandth of the whole; truly, it was not enough to boast of. Thus, believing none could compare to himself—this was the River Lord’s folly. Such is the coarse and vulgar talk of the unlearned, not a comprehensive discourse.

**Exegesis**:
*Northern Sea*: Li (Yun) says: "This refers to the region north of the Eastern Sea."
*Face and gaze*: Pronounced *mò gāng* (ancient *mang* rhyme), also read *páng*, or *wàng*. The original text writes it as *wàng*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: "Modern editions write *mang* as *wang*."
*Yang*: Pronounced *yáng*.
Sima (Biao) and Cui (Yuan) say: "*Mang yang* is like *wang yang*, meaning the appearance of looking upward."
*Xiang Ruo*: *Xiang* is pronounced *xiàng* (Xu’s reading) or *xiàng* (Xu Liang’s reading).
Sima says: "*Ruo* is the sea god."
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Exegesis* cites Sima and Cui’s original text as *mang yang*, explaining it as *wang yang*, the appearance of looking upward. Here, *yang* and *yang* are both loan characters; the proper character should be *yang*. The *Lunheng*’s *Gu Xiang* chapter states: "King Wu *wang yang*," meaning he gazed upon the sun. Since the sun is in the sky, one must look upward to see it, hence the gloss as "looking upward."
*Having heard of a hundred ways*: Li (Yun) says: "This means one ten-thousandth."
◎ Jia Shifu says: Li Gui explains: "*Having heard of a hundred ways* means one ten-thousandth." Here, *having heard* contrasts with *having seen* below. Though one may have heard much, one does not grasp its boundlessness. Estimating its extent with one’s own judgment and believing in one’s progress, only upon *seeing* its infinity does one suddenly feel lost. *Hundred* is a word for "many"; Li’s annotation is incorrect.
◎ Qingfan notes: *Hundred* was anciently read like *bo*, rhyming with *ruo*. The *Han Shu*’s *Zou Yang Zhuan* reads: "*Zhi niao lei bo*," rhyming with *e*. Cai Yong’s *Du Duan* reads: "The *La* prayer’s words: *sui qu qian bo*," rhyming with *zhai he*.

**Annotation**:
To know one’s smallness and not presume greatness is to have one’s principles and place settled in advance, leaving no room for the ambition of striving upward.

**Exegesis**:
*Fang* means "way." The world regards Confucius’s editing and fixing of the Six Classics as vast learning and broad knowledge, and Boyi’s yielding of the state as pure and noble, their virtues weighty. Yet there are also learned and enlightened scholars who, in lofty discourse, deem Boyi’s virtue light and Confucius’s learning meager—this is the River Lord’s "having heard," which he secretly doubted. Now, seeing the vastness of the great sea, boundless and unfathomable, he realizes that what he heard before was not false. Had the River Lord never come to Hai Ruo’s gate, his affairs would have been perilously complete. Having seen only the narrow and inferior, he would long have been mocked by those who master the great Dao.

**Exegesis**:
*Now I see*: Formerly read *du* (ancient *tu* rhyme). The *Shuo Wen* states: "*Du* is the modern character; *du* is the ancient character. *Du* means 'to see.'" Cui’s text reads: "*Now I see*," explaining: "*Du* means 'to show.'"
*Masters of the great Way*: Sima says: "This refers to the great Dao."
*Principle and place*: Pronounced *fú wèn* (ancient *wen* rhyme), same below.

**Collation**:
(1) The two *du* characters are corrected according to the main text below.

Hai Ruo said: "You cannot speak of the sea to a well-dweller, for he is confined by his dwelling. You cannot speak of ice to a summer insect, for it is bound by its season. You cannot speak of the Dao to a narrow scholar, for he is constrained by his teachings.

Now that you have emerged from the riverbanks and observed the great sea, you know your own ugliness and may be spoken to of great principles. Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers return to it, yet it never fills, though no one knows when they will cease. The Tail Hole drains it, yet it never empties, though no one knows when it will end. It does not change with spring and autumn, nor does it know flood or drought. This surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River, which cannot be measured or counted.

Yet I have never boasted of this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive my qi from yin and yang. I exist between heaven and earth like a small stone or tree in a great mountain. Since I still perceive myself as small, how could I boast?

Consider the Four Seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a tiny hole in a great marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? The number of things is called ten thousand, and humans occupy one part. Humans gather in the Nine Provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carts travel, yet humans occupy but one part. Compared to the ten thousand things, is this not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?

What the Five Emperors inherited, what the Three Kings fought over, what the benevolent worried about, and what the capable labored for—all of this is encompassed here. Boyi refused it to gain fame; Confucius spoke of it to display his learning. Their self-satisfaction was no different from your former boasting about water."

**Annotation**:
What living things find natural and secure has its own limits.

**Exegesis**:
Hai Ruo, knowing the River Lord’s narrowness, cites three things as analogies. A well-frog, hearing of the great sea’s hundred-foot waves without wind, would not believe it, for it is confined by its dwelling. A summer insect, upon hearing of winter’s ice and hail, would not believe it, for its heart is thick with summer’s time. A narrow scholar, a biased person, hearing of the all-pervading Dao—transcending sages, abandoning wisdom, making the tip of a hair large and Mount Tai small, making the short-lived equal to Pengzu—would not believe it, for he is bound by the teachings of names.

And so too was the River Lord’s case: until he reached the vast river and encountered Hai Ruo, he prided himself on his own greatness—its meaning was the same.

The well-fish, unable to be spoken to of the sea, was confined by its dwelling; the summer insect, unable to be spoken to of ice, was thick with its season’s time; the narrow scholar, unable to be spoken to of the all-pervading Dao, was bound by the teachings of names. Now the River Lord, emerging from his banks and shores and beholding the great sea, came to know his own shame. Having awakened to the limits of his dwelling, he could then be spoken to of the boundless principle.

Tailü is the place where the sea’s waters drain away. Located east of the azure sea, there stands a stone four myriad *li* in breadth and four myriad *li* in thickness, positioned at the tail-end of the hundred rivers and serving as their gathering gate—hence the name Tailü. Where the sea’s waters pour upon it, they are instantly scorched, and so it is also called Scorched. The *Shanhaijing* states that Yi shot down the nine suns, which fell to become Scorched—this claim is absurd and need not be recounted in detail. In spring, the rains are scant; in autumn, they are abundant. Yao suffered floods, while Tang endured drought. Yet the sea as a thing receives the myriad rivers without ever filling, drains into Scorched without ever emptying, remains unchanged in its abundance through spring and autumn, and knows no increase or decrease in times of flood or drought. In its vastness, it far surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River—how could one speak of measuring it? The disparity is too great.

The present account expands upon the details cited in the *Explanations of Text*. *Liangshu* is read as *liàng*. The commentary and subsequent instances follow the same pronunciation.

[4] [Commentary] Though the capacities of the hundred rivers are exhausted when suspended against the Yellow River, the Yellow River when suspended against the sea, and the sea when suspended against Heaven and Earth—each possesses its own measure. This opening statement, in its tone, seems to suggest that observing the great can clarify the small, yet its intent lies elsewhere. The affliction of the world is its lack of equilibrium: those who embody greatness are discontented (*yàng*), dismissing the small as utterly insufficient, while those of small substance are complacent, deeming the great to be entirely adequate. Thus, high and low vie in exaggeration, each losing themselves in self-regard—this is the very confusion of the people. To correct the confused, nothing serves better than first exhausting their disparities and then addressing their claims. What they call great is utterly sufficient, so that even the tip of an autumn hair cannot burden Heaven and Earth; what they call small is utterly without surplus, so that Heaven and Earth cannot surpass the tip of an autumn hair. Only then may the confused find cause to turn back, each recognizing its limit, things resting in their proper place, and those who wander freely moving at their own pace within the realm of self-contentment. This is the virtuous resonance that Zhuangzi sought to evoke. If, as the confused assert, small and great were to overturn one another, such overturning would know no end. As for those who behold the great yet cannot rest content with the small, or regard the little and deem themselves abundant—racing in the contest of victory and defeat, aiding the world’s people in their boasting—how could they grasp the purport of Master Zhuang!

[Exegesis] *Cun* means "to exist." *Xi* means "how." Nothing encompasses the myriad things more vastly than Heaven and Earth; nothing distributes *qi* and engenders transformation more vastly than *yin* and *yang*. Thus, when the Sea Spirit compares its form to Heaven and Earth, there is no hierarchy in which to lodge itself; when it speaks of receiving *qi* from *yin* and *yang*, it is but one entity among their manifestations. Therefore, it borrows things as metaphors—like a tiny tree or pebble upon Mount Tai—while the Sea Spirit, in the principle of Heaven, remains in scarcity. Each thing has its measure; how could it boast of its own abundance!

*Er xuan* is read as *xuán*. Subsequent instances follow the same pronunciation.

The reading of *angran* is *yù liàng* or *yú liáng*. The reading of *zhi jing* is *jìng*.

[Exegesis] *Lěi kōng* refers to an ant’s nest. *Tí* is a grass resembling barnyard millet, but its grains are exceedingly fine and few. *Zhōngguó* refers to the Nine Provinces. The Four Seas lie within Heaven and Earth, while the Nine Provinces reside within the Four Seas—are they not like an ant’s nest in a great marsh, or a grain of *tí* in a vast granary? This illustrates the vast disparity in their relative size and worth.

[Exegesis Notes] *Lěi* is read as *lì zuì*; earlier sources concur. Cui reads it as *lěi*, while Li reads it as *lì duì*. *Kōng* is read as *kǒng*. *Lěi kōng* means a small hole. Li explains it as a small mound; another gloss calls it an anthill. ◎ Jia Shifu remarks: The *Exegesis Notes* cite Cui’s gloss, "a small hole," and Li Gui’s, "a small mound," with another saying it is an anthill. Now, *lěi kōng* inherently carries two meanings, describing the configuration of height and depth. *Lěi* denotes something abruptly rising; *kōng* denotes something hollowed and low. Within a great marsh, some parts bulge upward while others sink deep—naturally undulating, these opposing forms always complement one another, hence the term *lěi kōng*. Sima Xiangru’s *Shanglin Fu* speaks of "mounds and hollows, dug and piled," which conveys the same idea: the terrain of mounds and hollows may be excavated into pits or heaped into hillocks. *Tí mǐ* is read as *tú xī*. Sima explains it as "small grains"; Li explains it as "the *tí* grass." According to Guo’s commentary on the *Erya*, *tí* resembles barnyard millet (read *pú mài*). *Dà cāng* is read as *tài*.

[Section Six]
[Annotation] The distinction between small and great follows its own hierarchy, and one cannot overreach it.
[Exegesis] *Hào* means "name" or "title." *Zú* means "multitude." Though the number of things does not stop at ten thousand, common speech often refers to "the myriad things," of which humans are but one. The Nine Provinces of *Zhōngguó* teem with people, yield the hundred grains, and see the coming and going of boats and carriages—among the myriad things, they too occupy but a single place. Yet when humans are compared to the myriad things, and the Nine Provinces to the cosmos, it is no different from a single hair on a horse’s body—how could it be worth dwelling upon?
[Exegesis Notes] *Rén zú* is read as *zūn hū*. Sima explains *zú* as "multitude"; Cui reads it as *zǐ* and explains it as "exhaustive." ◎ Jia Shifu remarks: The *Exegesis Notes* cite Sima’s gloss, "*zú* means multitude," and Cui’s, "exhaustive." Now, *rén zú* of the Nine Provinces refers to the totality of their population. *Zú* here is an exhaustive term. Though the Nine Provinces are vast and their people numerous, within the cosmos they are but one among the myriad things. Cui’s explanation is correct. ◎ Yu Yue remarks: The meaning of *rén zú* is unclear. Sima’s gloss of *zú* as "multitude" and Cui’s as "exhaustive" are both untenable. Moreover, below it says "humans occupy but a single place," so this passage should not refer to humans. *Rén zú* is likely a corruption of *dà shuài* ("in general"). In the "Ren Jian Shi" chapter, it says *shuài rán fǔ zhī*, and the *Exegesis Notes* note that *shuài* may be written as *zú*. This is evidence of the graphic similarity between *shuài* and *zú* leading to error. Once *shuài* was corrupted into *zú*, *dà* was altered to *rén* to match. According to the "Zhi Le" chapter, "when people in general hear of it," and the "Dao Zhi" chapter, "people in general have never failed to pursue fame and profit," the phrase *rén zú* does appear in this text, yet it makes no sense here. *Dà shuài* means "in general." Above it says, "reckoning the Four Seas within Heaven and Earth," and again, "reckoning the Nine Provinces within the seas"—*jì* ("reckoning") and *dà shuài* ("in general") share the same meaning.

[Section Seven]
[Annotation] It does not transcend a single domain.
[Exegesis] The Five Emperors succeeded one another through yielding, the Three Kings waged war to seize power, benevolent men toiled anxiously for their states, and capable scholars labored diligently in their duties. Though their undertakings differed, all their principles were exhausted within the tiniest of things.
[Exegesis Notes] *Wǔ cháng zhī suǒ lián*: Sima explains it as "the continuity of benevolence and righteousness"; Cui explains *lián* as "continuity." The base text also writes it as "Five Emperors." ◎ Lu Wenchang remarks: The current text writes it as "Five Emperors." ◎ Jia Shifu remarks: The ancient *Zhuangzi* edition from the Jiangnan collection writes *lián* as *yùn* ("to revolve"), which seems more fitting. *Suǒ zhēng* is read as *cè gēng*. *Rèn shì zhī suǒ láo*: Li explains *rèn* as "capable" and *láo* as "to serve."

[Section Eight]
[Annotation] Things have their fixed domains, and even the most discerning cannot transcend them. Thus, the distinction between great and small serves to elucidate that the ultimate principle admits no debate.
[Exegesis] Boyi yielded his rank to secure his fame, while Confucius expounded the Six Classics to display his erudition. Relying on such trivialities and priding themselves on them—how is this different from the River Spirit’s earlier boasting of his waters? This unifies the preceding metaphors and explains why Confucius’s vast learning is slighted and Boyi’s yielding is deemed insignificant.

The River Spirit said, "Then may I consider Heaven and Earth as great and the tip of a hair as small?"¹
¹[Exegesis] Nothing is greater in form than Heaven and Earth, and nothing is smaller in substance than the tip of a hair. Thus, by citing the great and the small, it clarifies that allotted endowments differ. The River Spirit presents what he knows and inquires of the Sea Spirit.

Moreover, another interpretation: If one takes self-sufficiency as greatness, I may surpass the Two Modes; if one takes nothing in excess as smallness, I may be smaller than the tip of a hair. Having grasped this insight, the River Spirit equalized self and other, thus expounding his understanding and inquiring whether it was admissible.

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied, "No. For things, their measure is inexhaustible;¹ their time knows no cessation;² their allotment is inconstant;³ and their end and beginning are without fixed pattern.⁴ Therefore, one of great wisdom observes both far and near, so that the small is not deficient⁵ and the great is not excessive,⁶ knowing that measure is inexhaustible;⁷ one verifies past and present,⁸ so that the distant does not cause frustration⁹ and the brief does not prompt striving,¹⁰ knowing that time knows no cessation.¹¹ One examines the full and the empty, so that gain does not bring joy nor loss sorrow,¹² knowing that allotment is inconstant.¹³ One comprehends the level path,¹⁴ so that life does not bring delight nor death calamity,¹⁵ knowing that end and beginning cannot be fixed.¹⁶

Calculating what man knows, it is not as much as what he does not know;¹⁷ the time of his life is not as long as the time before his birth.¹⁸ Seeking to exhaust the realm of the supremely great through the supremely small, he thus becomes confused and cannot attain self-realization.¹⁹ From this perspective, how can one know that the tip of a hair suffices to define the limit of the minutest!²⁰ And how can one know that Heaven and Earth suffice to exhaust the realm of the supremely great!"

¹[Commentary] Each thing has its own measure.
[Exegesis] Having grasped the doubt, he answers, "It is not admissible." The capacity of things differs according to their allotted endowments; each receives what is fitting and attains its proper state. Yet with myriad differences and countless kinds, where they attain fittingness, there is neither great nor small—how can one arbitrarily impose what one knows and suppress it as definitive!

²[Commentary] Death and life are both the course of time.
[Exegesis] Renewal never ceases.

³[Commentary] Gain and loss are both allotments.
[Exegesis] The allotted mandate changes with the times.

⁴[Commentary] It is ever new.
[Exegesis] Though it ends and begins again, it is never not new.

⁵[Commentary] Each is self-sufficient.
[Exegesis] The following explains that measure is inexhaustible. With the wisdom of a great sage, one observes distant principles and examines nearby affairs, so that even the tip of a hair, though small, is self-sufficient in its essence and not deficient.

⁶[Commentary] Nor is there excess.
[Exegesis] Though Heaven and Earth are great, in their essence there is no excess, so they do not suffice to be considered great. Without excess, there is no boasting; without deficiency, there is no striving.

⁷[Commentary] Observing them together, one knows that things far and near, great and small, each have their measure.
[Exegesis] With the wisdom of a great person, one knows the capacity of things. Though great and small differ, each accords with its nature; though rising and falling vary, their measure is inexhaustible. This concludes the explanation that the measure of things is inexhaustible.

⁸[Commentary] *Xiang* means "to clarify." *Jin gu* means "past and present."
[Exegesis] The following explains that time knows no cessation. *Xiang* means "to clarify." Having known that small and great are not small and great, one thus clarifies that past and present are not past and present.

⁹[Commentary] *Yao* means "distant."
¹⁰[Commentary] *Duo* means "brief."
[Exegesis] *Yao* means "distant." *Duo* means "brief." Having known that past and present are not past and present, one thus knows that long life and early death are not long life and early death. Therefore, when one’s lifespan is extended, one does not grow weary of life and become frustrated; when one’s allotted years are cut short, one does not rejoice in or strive for long life. Following change and submitting to transformation, one has never not been oneself.

¹¹[Commentary] Clarifying past and present, one knows that transformation does not cease at death and life, so one does not become frustrated by the distant or strive for the brief.
[Exegesis] This concludes the explanation that time knows no cessation.

¹²[Exegesis] The following explains that allotment is inconstant. Since the Dao of Heaven has fullness and emptiness, how can human affairs lack gain and loss? Thus, observing the changes of fullness and emptiness and understanding the principle of gain and loss, one obtains things unexpectedly—this is due to timing and not cause for joy; one loses things by chance—this is due to fate and not cause for sorrow.

¹³[Commentary] Examining the alternation of fullness and emptiness, one knows that allotment is not constant in gain, so one can forget sorrow and joy.
[Exegesis] This concludes the explanation that allotment is inconstant.

¹⁴[Commentary] Death and life are the proper Dao of daily renewal.

[Exegesis] The following explains the principle that end and beginning are without fixed nature. "Tranquil" means level; "path" means the Way. Not taking death as death, not taking life as life—thus death and life are without separation. Such is the understanding of the great Dao of level equanimity.

¹⁵[Exegesis] One who understands the tranquil Dao neither rejoices excessively at life nor deems death a calamity. Having grasped the non-duality of death and life, how can sorrow or joy be discussed?

¹⁶[Commentary] To perceive the daily renewal of end and beginning is to know that the old cannot be clung to or retained. Thus, one enters the new without alarm and relinquishes the old without surprise, for the transformations of death and life are as one.
[Exegesis] This concludes the explanation of the principle that end and beginning are without fixed nature.

¹⁷[Commentary] What is known has its limits.
[Exegesis] Forced knowing deviates from the real; not-knowing accords with the Dao. By this reckoning, deliberate knowing is inferior.

¹⁸[Commentary] Each life has its allotted years.
[Exegesis] Before birth, there is no joy and thus no sorrow; after birth, there is attachment and thus aversion.

¹⁹[Commentary] Nothing compares to resting content in one’s allotted portion.
[Exegesis] The smallest is wisdom; the greatest is the realm. To employ finite, limited wisdom in pursuit of an infinite, boundless realm—before the boundless realm is fully encompassed, the finite wisdom is already lost. Thus, one remains deluded throughout life, with no way to return to the root, having lost oneself in the pursuit of things and never attaining self-possession.

²⁰[Commentary] Seeking the great with the small can never succeed in principle; each resting in its portion, both great and small are complete. If the tip of a hair does not seek the workings of Heaven and Earth, then all beyond the body’s needs becomes superfluous. If Heaven and Earth are not seen as greater than an autumn hair, then regarding one’s own form, it is merely sufficient. How then can one determine the definiteness of the small or the definiteness of the great?
[Exegesis] All things receive their allotment, each different; though great and small differ, all may be called fitting. If the small aspires to the great, one becomes deluded and loses one’s nature; if each rests in its portion, all attain the same freedom. Thus, though the tip of a hair is small, its nature is sufficient to be called great; though the Two Modes are vast, they lack nothing to be called small. From this perspective, why must the boundary of the smallest necessarily lie in the tip of a hair? How can the domain of the greatest be exclusively exhausted by Heaven and Earth?

River Earl said: "Those who discuss the world all say, 'The most refined is without form; the greatest cannot be encompassed.' Is this a true reflection of reality?"

The annotation states: *Xin* means "real." Common worldly discussions, unable to distinguish right from wrong, all claim that the most refined lacks form and substance, and the most vast cannot be encompassed. Yet they do not know whether this principle is true or false in essence or understanding. As the River Earl has not yet grasped this, he raises this doubt.

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: "One who views the great from the perspective of the small cannot exhaust it; one who views the small from the perspective of the great cannot see it clearly. The refined is the subtlest of the small; the vast is the fullness of the great—thus their advantages differ. This is the nature of their condition.

The refined and the coarse are limited to what has form. What is without form cannot be divided by calculation; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by calculation. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect of things. That which cannot be discussed in words nor grasped by intention does not fall within the realm of the refined or the coarse.

[Annotation] The eye’s vision has a constant limit and cannot be boundless. Thus, regarding the great, there is always something it cannot exhaust; regarding the fine, there is always something it cannot see clearly. This is simply what the eye cannot reach. Both the refined and the vast are not nonexistent—how could one presume to know what is without form and cannot be encompassed?

[Exegesis] When one views vast things from the perspective of the small, one cannot exhaust their vastness, hence they are said to be "unfathomable." When one observes small things from the perspective of the vast, one cannot clearly discern their details, hence they are said to "lack form and substance." Yet these are merely limitations of the realm of the existent—how could they represent the meaning of the utmost absence?

[Annotation] Great and small differ, so their advantages cannot be the same.

[Exegesis] *Jing* means "subtle and small." *Fū* means "abundant and great." To clarify: the smallest within the small and the greatest within the great, though their endowment of *qi* differs, do not depart from what has form. The heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, each possessing its own fitting advantage.

[Phonetic Gloss] *Fū*: Li reads as *pǔhuí*; Xu reads as *fú*, meaning "abundant."

Guō reads *fāng yóu* in reverse; Cuī reads as *póu*. *Zhīyīn*: *Yīn* means "multitude." ◎ Qìngfān notes: *Yīn* means "great," hence the exegesis states "the greatest within the great," and should not be glossed as "multitude." *Yìbiàn*: Bì reads as *bìmiàn*; Xú reads as *fúmiàn*. The annotation is the same.

[Annotation] If it lacks form and cannot be encompassed, then it possesses no such differing advantages.
[Exegesis] Since great and small differ, their fitting advantages also diverge; thus, we know this condition has not transcended the realm of the existent.

[Annotation] There is fine and coarse, hence it cannot be without form.
[Exegesis] To speak of fine and coarse is necessarily to remain within the domain of form and name, and has not yet transcended the bounds of language and image.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Jīngcū*: Qī hú in reverse. The same below.

[Exegesis] That which lacks form and cannot be encompassed is the Dao. The utmost Dao is profoundly mysterious, beyond mind and form; thus, it cannot be distinguished by names and numbers, nor exhausted by measures and quantities.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Néng fēn*: As written.

[Annotation] It is merely absence—what fine or coarse could there be? That which is expressed in words and conceived in thought belongs to the realm of the existent, yet what is expressed and conceived is absence. Therefore, one must seek beyond words and thoughts, entering the domain of non-expression and non-conception, only then reaching it.
[Exegesis] That which can be articulated in speech or debated in discourse pertains to the coarse methods of existent things; that which can be grasped by the mind or attained through intention pertains to the fine details of existent things. Yet what neither the divine tongue can express nor the sagely mind can fathom is the wondrous principle. One must seek beyond words and thoughts—how could it be confined to the realm of fine and coarse?
[Phonetic Gloss] *Bùnéng lùn*: Some versions write *yù* instead.
[Collation] (1) *Quēwù* cites the Zhang Junfang edition, which includes the character *ěr* after *biàn*. (2) The character *xíng* is amended following the phrase "bound by form" in the subsequent text. (3) The character *suǒ* is supplied based on the preceding sentence.

Thus, the conduct of the great person does not involve harming others, nor does it excessively display benevolence and kindness. In action, they do not seek profit, nor do they despise gatekeepers and servants. They do not contend over wealth and possessions, nor do they excessively engage in deference and yielding. In affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they excessively consume by their own labor, nor do they despise the greedy and corrupt. Their conduct differs from the common, yet they do not excessively pursue eccentricity. Their actions follow the multitude, yet they do not despise flattery and obsequiousness. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them, while punishment and shame are insufficient to humiliate them. They know that right and wrong cannot be divided, nor can the fine and the coarse be distinguished.

It is said: *"The Dao-person does not hear, the utmost virtue is not attained, the great person has no self."* This is the utmost in moderation.

**Annotations:**
**[1]** The great person acts without intention, following the natural course. Wherever they step, they tread upon auspicious ground—how could they take the path of harming others?
**[Exegesis]** The great person responds to things as the heavens move—revolving without intent. Thus, wherever they tread is auspicious ground; their words benefit others, yet they never harm anyone.

**[2]** Without harm, they do not overvalue their own kindness.
**[Exegesis]** Their compassion is like the spring sun, yet they do not excessively bestow benevolence.

**[3]** They move in accordance with principle, and principle itself is free from harm.
**[Exegesis]** They act in response to the moment, not confining their heart to benefiting things.

**[4]** They employ others according to their abilities, and their position is fitting—this is not because they despise them and thus assign them to such roles.
**[Exegesis]** They blend honor and disgrace, unify poverty and prosperity, and thus regard gatekeepers and servants without contempt.

**[7]** Each is made to bear their own responsibilities.
**[Exegesis]** Whether foolish or wise, they follow their nature, embracing their innate skills—never borrowing from others or seeking beyond their proper duties.

**[8]** They take only what is sufficient.
**[Exegesis]** They consume only what is within their portion, contenting themselves without excessive greed or exhausting their minds and strength.

**[9]** Principle itself is free from desire.
**[Exegesis]** They embody the profound Dao, thus free from passions—not because they artificially value purity and despise greed and corruption.

**[10]** They alone are without "can" or "cannot," and thus differ from the common.
**[Exegesis]** They harmonize with the dust yet remain unstained, embracing all without distinction—thus their conduct differs from the vulgar.

**[Exegesis]** The perfected person has no fixed mind, never insisting on their own way—thus all their actions follow the multitude.

**[13]** Naturally upright.
**[Exegesis]** Their nature is loyal and steadfast, untouched by devious paths—not because they first despise flattery and obsequiousness before attaining uprightness.

**[14]** The world’s ranks and emoluments cannot encourage them, nor can punishment and shame humiliate them.
**[Exegesis]** (Omitted in translation as it repeats the main text.)

**[15]** They know that right and wrong cannot be divided, nor can the fine and the coarse be distinguished.

**Collation Notes:**
**[Family Elder Jia’s Commentary]** The conduct of the great person comprises five principles: fundamentally not harming others, which is not for the sake of benevolence; having no regard for nobility or baseness, wealth or profit in their heart—how could they engage in deference and yielding? Not leading others for personal gain—how could they be greedy or corrupt? Their conduct naturally differs from the vulgar, not for the sake of eccentricity. Following the multitude, not for the sake of flattery.

*"Affairs are not borrowed from others"*—like Xu Xing’s claim to govern by plowing alongside the people, eating only what they cook themselves.
*"Not excessively consuming by their own labor"*—like Laozi’s saying: *"I take no action, yet the people enrich themselves; I do nothing, yet the people naturally return to simplicity."* The greedy and corrupt will cease of their own accord—there is no need to despise them. Guo Xiang’s commentary fails to clarify this.

**[14]**
**Commentary:** External affairs do not touch the heart.
**Exegesis:** High office and generous emoluments—these the world deems glorious; punishment, demotion, and disgrace—these the world deems shameful. Yet when one realizes that glory and decay are not one’s own, and that success and obstruction have their appointed times, then what comes is not enough to encourage, nor what departs enough to humiliate.

◎Jia Shifu says: The world’s ranks and stipends are insufficient to spur, its punishments and shames insufficient to humiliate. Continuing from above: by non-action, the people transform themselves. Benevolence and yielding have no place to be applied; greed and flattery no use to be made. What need then for ranks, stipends, punishments, or shames? Guo Xiang’s saying that external affairs do not rest in the heart is mistaken.

**[15]**
**Commentary:** Thus they are profoundly one.
**Exegesis:** Each clings to right and wrong, so right and wrong cannot be fixed divisions; each deems itself great or small, so how can fine and coarse have boundaries? This is what is meant by "heaven and earth, the tip of a hair."

**[16]**
**Commentary:** Entrusting things to their own natures, their natures naturally flow—thus merit and fame return to things, and so are not heard of.
**Exegesis:** The sage who embodies the Dao, harmonizing light and concealing brilliance, ascribes achievement to things, leaving no merit or fame to be heard. Attributing it to others, one speaks of hearing it said.

**[17]**
**Commentary:** Gain arises from loss; if things each have no loss, then the name of gain vanishes.
**Exegesis:** Gain is the name for not losing. Yet the one who attains the ultimate, equal in gain and loss, having nothing to lose, also has nothing to gain. Thus the *Laozi* says: *"The highest virtue does not act as virtue."*

**[18]**
**Commentary:** Simply entrusting things to themselves.
**Exegesis:** The great sage responds to stimuli, adapting to things as square or round—thus having no self.
**Exegesis on the Text:** *"Wuji"* (no self) reads as *ji*.

**[19]**
**Commentary:** Binding them to reach their proper limits, thus they are obscure. Only that which is utterly formless and cannot be encompassed is so.
**Exegesis:** *Yue* means to rely upon; *fen* means boundary. The great person benefits things, which may take many paths, but in essence, nothing precedes relying on their proper limits. If one sees only what the eye can see, hears only what the ear can hear, knows only what the mind can know, and restricts oneself to these boundaries—this is the perfection of virtue.
**Collation Notes:**
(1) The missing text cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, which adds *"zhi tu ye"* (of these paths) after *"ren"* (person).
(2) Zhao Jianyi’s edition omits *"er"* (and) and *"ye"* (also).
(3) The character *"wei"* (act) is amended following the original text of the *Laozi*.
(4) The Shidetang edition reads *"xi"* (rest) instead of *"jie"* (touch); Zhao’s edition omits this sentence.

The River Lord said: *"Beyond things, within things—where do the distinctions of noble and base arise? Where do the boundaries of small and great emerge?"*
**[1]**
**Exegesis:** *"Beyond things, within things"* refers to the inner and outer of things’ natures. *"Wu"* (where) means *"he"* (what). The distinctions of noble and base, the boundaries of small and great—do they lie within the nature of things, or beyond it? To what place do they extend? The River Lord, not yet comprehending their source, thus makes this inquiry.
**Exegesis on the Text:** *"Wu zhi"* (where to) reads as *wu zhi*. The same below.

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "Observed through the Dao, things have no noble or base.
**[1]**
Observed through things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base.
**[2]**
Observed through custom, noble and base lie not within oneself.
**[3]**
Observed through distinctions: if you magnify what each thing considers great, then nothing in the world is not great; if you diminish what each thing considers small, then nothing in the world is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, that the tip of a hair is as a mountain—then the gradations of difference become clear.
**[4]**
Observed through function: if you affirm what each thing possesses, then nothing in the world is without; if you negate what each thing lacks, then nothing in the world is not lacking. Knowing that east and west, though opposite, cannot do without each other—then the divisions of function are settled.
**[5]**
Observed through inclination: if you affirm what each thing affirms, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if you negate what each thing negates, then nothing in the world is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed their own ways and negated the other—then the tendencies of conduct become clear.
**[6]**

**[1]**
**Commentary:** Each is self-sufficient.
**Exegesis:** The Dao is the wondrous principle of emptiness and penetration; things are coarse matters of form and obstruction. To view the wondrous through the coarse is to perceive great and small; to observe the coarse through the wondrous is to find no noble or base.

**[2]**
**Commentary:** These petty distinctions are what the Dao interweaves and equalizes.
**Exegesis:** When the sentiments of things are inverted and their judgments confused, each desires to esteem itself and belittle others. Others, too, esteem themselves and belittle the rest—thus, all harbor delusion, and so it is called "mutual."

**[3]**
**Commentary:** This is what is meant by inversion.
**Exegesis:** Glory and shame arise by chance, yet the vulgar mind mistakenly feels joy or sorrow. Thus, what comes by chance is deemed noble, and its attainment is called honor; what departs by chance is deemed base, and its loss is called disgrace. Such honor and disgrace depend on external things—how can noble and base lie within oneself?

**[4]**
**Commentary:** What is great is sufficient; what is small leaves no remainder.

Thus, by following its inherent nature to be called great, the tip of a hair and a mountain peak cannot differ in name; by following its lack of remainder to be called small, heaven-and-earth and a grain of millet share no distinction in designation. If, however, one observes differences without relying on this Way, then gradations accumulate, infinitesimal disparities tilt against one another, and they cannot be exhaustively examined.

**Exegesis:** *Difference* means distinction. If one takes self-sufficiency as greatness, then the tip of a hair and a mountain peak are equal in greatness; if one takes lack of remainder as smallness, then heaven-and-earth and a grain of millet are equal in smallness. Therefore, if one takes the tip of a hair as the basis for greatness, then the myriad things are all great; if one takes heaven-and-earth as the basis for smallness, then the myriad things are all small. Thus, though there be a thousand distinctions and ten thousand boundaries, with differing measures and quantities, when viewed through this principle, the pattern becomes evident.

◎**Jia Shifu says:** The Dao is what unites self and other; *things* are what the mind relies upon to weigh others; *custom* is what follows convention to determine noble and base; *difference* is the gradation of the myriad things; *merit* is the achievement required by both self and other; *inclination* is the aim of the single mind. Though tangled and chaotic, each is upheld by the Dao, and thus each has its root when spoken of. Noble and base, great and small—debated, contested, and overturned—are why the world is so rife with complications.

**[Chapter Five]**
**[Annotation]**
In the world, none do not mutually constitute "other" and "self," yet both "other" and "self" seek to act for themselves—hence the opposition of east and west. Nevertheless, "other" and "self" are as interdependent as lips and teeth. Though lips and teeth do not act for each other, when the lips perish, the teeth grow cold. Thus, the self-serving actions of the "other" vastly benefit the "self"—this is their opposition, yet they cannot do without one another. Therefore, if one disregards their self-serving actions and denies their merit, then the merits of the world will all be nullified; if one acknowledges their indispensability and affirms their merit, then the merits of the world will all be established. Yet if one forgets the merit of self-serving actions and instead dwells on the favors of mutual aid, the more diligently such favors are pursued, the more hypocrisy and shallowness proliferate. The world loses its proper work, and human nature becomes dissolute—thus, the apportionment of merit can never be fixed.

**[Subcommentary]**
East and west are opposite directions, yet without east, west cannot stand—this is their indispensability. Taking the body as a closer example: the eye sees, the ear hears, the hand grasps, the foot walks; the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and hundred parts each possess their own functions, all endowed with fixed roles. How could the eye see for the ear, or the foot walk for the hand? The merit of mutual aid is extinguished here. This is to negate what is not inherently theirs, and thus the myriad things are all negated. Yet if the feet do not walk, the four limbs grow weary; if the eyes do not see, the hundred parts become obstructed. Each part fulfills its own office without consciously aiding the other, yet the benefit to the other naturally arises. This is to affirm what is inherently theirs, and thus the myriad things all possess merit. Viewed thus, functions exist, and roles are each fixed. But if one forgets the merit of self-serving actions and instead dwells on the favors of mutual aid, then "self" and "other" lose their nature, and right and wrong become confused—how could this be the intent of Master Zhuang!

As for the character 然, it is to be read in its usual sense.

All things are natural, thus none are unnatural; all things mutually negate, thus none are without negation. Where none are without negation, there is no affirmation; where none are unnatural, there is no negation. He who embodies neither affirmation nor negation is Yao; he who embodies both affirmation and negation is Jie. Yet these two rulers each received their innate endowment from Heaven and could not transform one into the other. Thus, by observing Yao and Jie, one may perceive the tendencies and dispositions of the world—how they cannot be made to interchange is evident.

Now, all things deem themselves right, thus none are not right; all things mutually negate, thus none are without negation. Where none are without negation, the world has no right; where none are not right, the world has no wrong. Therefore, observing the inclinations of things: if one follows their self-affirmation, then the myriad things are all right; if one follows their mutual negation, then the myriad things are all wrong. The most extreme opposites in the world are Yao and Jie, and so these two rulers are cited to illustrate the duality of right and wrong. Yao regarded non-action as right and desire as wrong; Jie regarded non-action as wrong and desire as right. Thus it is said that Yao and Jie naturally negate one another. From this, the inclinations, dispositions, and aspirations of the myriad things in the world may be discerned.

Of old, Yao and Shun abdicated and became emperors, while Zihuai abdicated and perished; Tang and Wu contended and became kings, while the Duke of Bai contended and was destroyed. Viewed thus, the rites of contention and abdication, the conduct of Yao and Jie, the esteem and baseness of the times—these are not constant.

A roof beam may breach a city wall but cannot plug a rat hole: this speaks of differing implements. The swift steeds Qi Ji and Hua Liu may gallop a thousand li in a day, yet they are no match for a wildcat in catching mice: this speaks of differing skills. The owl snatches fleas at night, discerning the finest hairs, yet by day it emerges, glaring, and cannot see a hill or mountain: this speaks of differing natures.

Thus it is said: Should one follow right and reject wrong, follow order and reject chaos? This is to fail to comprehend the principles of Heaven and Earth and the conditions of the myriad things. It is like following Heaven while rejecting Earth, or following yin while rejecting yang—its impossibility is clear. Yet still one prattles on without ceasing: if not foolish, then deceitful.

The abdications of emperors and kings differ; the successions of the Three Dynasties differ. Those who miss their time and defy custom are called usurpers; those who meet their time and accord with custom are called righteous followers.

O silent River Spirit! How could you know the gate of esteem and baseness, the house of small and great?

Yao, knowing that the Mandate of Heaven had its destined recipient, abdicated to Shun; Shun, knowing that the dynastic succession was to change, yielded to Yu. Tang and Yu belong to the count of the Five Emperors, hence it is said that they became emperors through abdication.

Zi Zhi was the prime minister of Yan. Kuai was the name of the king of Yan. Zi Zhi was the son-in-law of Su Qin. Su Qin’s younger brother, Su Dai, came from Qi as an envoy to Yan and, citing the precedent of Yao’s abdication to Xu You, persuaded King Kuai of Yan to yield the throne to Zi Zhi. Zi Zhi then accepted. The people of the state resented his acceptance of the abdication and refused to submit to him, plunging the state into three years of chaos. King Xuan of Qi, following Su Dai’s plan, raised an army to attack Yan, whereupon King Kuai was killed in the suburbs and Zi Zhi was beheaded in the court, thus extinguishing the state of Yan. Was this not the result of imitating the old traces of Yao and Shun and bringing disaster to such an extent!

Tang of Yin overthrew Jie, and Wu of Zhou conquered Zhou; these two rulers both received the Mandate of Heaven, bringing about the purification of the Six Directions and the submission of the myriad states. Thus they succeeded the Three Kings of their time, hence it is said that they became kings through contention. When the times demand the use of weapons, one responds with Tang and Wu; when the times demand yielding and deference, one responds with Yao and Shun. Thus, in the myriad transformations and the encounter with things, one adapts to the moment—neither the traces of abdication nor those of contention can be rigidly adhered to.

White Duke was named Sheng, grandson of King Ping of Chu and son of Crown Prince Jian. King Ping heeded the words of Fei Wuji, took a daughter of Qin as consort, and estranged the crown prince. The crown prince fled to Zheng, where he married a woman of Zheng and fathered Sheng. After Grand Tutor Wu She was killed, Wu Zixu fled to Wu, and Sheng followed him there, tilling the fields together. The Chu minister Zixi welcomed Sheng back to the state and enfeoffed him at Bai County, where he usurped the title of duke. Sheng, holding the people of Zheng responsible for his father’s death, requested troops to avenge him. When his repeated requests were denied, he raised troops in rebellion. Chu dispatched the Viscount of Ye, Zigao, to suppress and destroy him—hence it is said that White Duke contended and perished.

Contention and yielding are the ways of Wen and Wu; Yao and Jie represent right and wrong. If one weaves the warp and woof of Heaven and Earth, then the martial is debased and the civil exalted; if one must quell calamity and disorder, then the civil is debased and the martial exalted. Thus the Way of Wen and Wu has its times of honor and disgrace, and the conduct of right and wrong likewise has its moments of use and disuse. Therefore, the rites of contention and yielding were prized in the times of Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu, but debased in the times of Zihuai and White Duke—they cannot be fixed as constants.

A *liang* is a roof beam, and *li* is a ridgepole. *Chong* means to strike, and *zhi* means to block. A large beam and ridgepole may be used to strike city walls, but cannot be used to block a mousehole—this shows that implements differ in their uses according to size.

The *qi*, *ji*, *hua*, and *liu* were all fine horses of antiquity. *Bu* means to seize, and *li* and *sheng* are wildcats. A fine steed with swift hooves can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet when it comes to seizing a small mouse, it is no match for a wildcat. This shows that skills differ, and one cannot apply a single standard to all.

To employ each according to its particular capacity is to ensure that nothing is misused.

The *chi* is an owl, also called a *zhi-hu*, a kind of earthen owl. By day its eyes are dim, but by night they are bright. Thus at night it can snatch fleas and lice, discerning the tip of an autumn hair, yet when it emerges by day, its eyes bulge wide and it cannot see the shape of a hill. This shows that the natures of things differ—how could this be true only of owls? Therefore, if one follows their natures and settles them accordingly, nothing will be misused.

The *chi* (尺夷反). Cui [Yuan] states: "The *chi* is the *xiu-liu*; it is the same as the *wei-xiao*." *Ye cuo* (七括反). Cui’s edition writes *zui* (最), with the same pronunciation. *Zao* (蚤), pronounced *zao*. The *Shuowen* says: "A jumping insect that bites people." The *Huainanzi* states: "The *chi* gathers fleas at night, discerning the tip of a hair’s end." Xu Shen says: "The *chi* gathers and feeds on fleas and lice at night without fail." Sima’s edition writes *wen* (文), stating: "The *chi* is the *xiu-liu*, which hunts for food at night." The present Guo edition also has an author’s note. Cui’s edition writes *zhua* (爪), stating: "The *xiu-liu* gathers people’s nails in its nest at night." ◎Wang Yinzhi says: "The character *xiu* (鸺) is a superfluous interpolation, influenced by the *chi xiu liu* in the *Shiwen*." (The *Pei Ya* already cites this in error.) He notes: "The *Shiwen* states, '*chi* (尺夷反), Cui says *chi xiu liu*,' but does not provide a pronunciation for *xiu*, which clearly indicates that the original text did not contain the character *xiu*. The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhu Shu* chapter also says: '*chi* gathers fleas at night.'" ◎Qing Fan notes: "*Zhua* (爪) and *zao* (蚤) are interchangeable, hence Cui’s edition writes *zhua*. The characters are graphically similar, so Sima’s edition writes *wen* (文)." The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhu Shu* chapter, in Gao You’s commentary, states: "The *chi* is the *chi xiu*, also called the *lao-tu*, which cries on people’s rooftops at night. Its eyes are bright at night, and it gathers people’s nails to place in its nest, hence the saying 'discerning the tip of an autumn hair.' By day, it sees nothing, hence the saying 'its nature and form are perverse.'" Xu Shen’s commentary says: "The *chi* gathers and feeds on fleas and lice at night without fail." The accounts of gathering fleas differ between Xu and Gao. Wang Yinzhi says: "Judging by reason, Xu Shen’s commentary is more refined." *Chen* (瞋), *chi yi* (尺夷反); Xiang [Xiu] reads *chu chen* (处辰反). Sima states: "To open wide." Cui reads *xuan* (眩), also *shi shen* (师慎反). Some editions write *ming* (瞑). ◎Qing Fan notes: "The *Shiwen* states that *chen* may also be written as *ming*. It is likely that *ming* is correct. The *Shuowen* says: '*Chen* means to glare angrily.' '*Ming* means to close the eyes.' With eyes closed, one sees nothing." In clerical script, *zhen* (真) may be written as *mian* (冥), or *ming* (冥) as *zhen* (□), leading to graphical confusion. The *Guanzi*’s *Xiao Wen* chapter says: "Duke Huan glared angrily," while the *Hanzi*’s *Shou Dao* chapter says: "Glaring angrily, gnashing teeth, straining ears." The *Huainanzi*’s *Dao Ying* chapter says: "Glaring angrily, rolling up sleeves, drawing swords." In all these cases, modern editions mistakenly write *ming* (瞑) for *chen* (瞋), which are further examples of this error.

**Commentary:** The principle of Heaven and Earth and the nature of the myriad things regard obtaining the self as right and losing the self as wrong, aligning with nature as order and losing harmony as chaos. Yet things have no fixed limit, and the self has no constant suitability. With differing natures and varying advantages, right and wrong have no fixed standard.

If one deems what is right by one’s own standards, then others cannot be deemed wrong—this is merely knowing the self while failing to see others. Thus, when viewed through the Dao, right and wrong have no fixed correspondence. Entrusting them to the equilibrium of Heaven and allowing both to proceed freely, then differing directions and distinct kinds all find their place.

**Subcommentary:** *Gai* (盖) is a term of inexhaustibility. *Shi* (师) here means following one’s own mind. Each thing follows its own *cheng*-heart, deludedly clinging to partiality: deeming oneself right while unaware that others deem one wrong, deeming oneself ordered while unaware that things deem one chaotic. Thus, following the mind to assert rightness, one fails to see that one’s own position may be wrong; following the mind to assert order, one claims one’s person is without chaos. How can one know that order and chaos share a single source, that right and wrong have no fixed ground? That order and chaos share a source is the principle of Heaven and Earth; that right and wrong have no fixed ground is the nature of the myriad things. Being blind to this truth, one’s words remain unclear.

**Exegesis:** *Shi shi* (师是): Some say *shi* means "to follow." *Shi zhi* (师治): Read as *zhì* (吏), with the same pronunciation in the commentary.

**【Eight】**
**Subcommentary:** Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, exist in mutual opposition. If there were Heaven without Earth, the myriad things would not take form; if there were yin without yang, living beings would not arise. Thus, it is clear that to assert rightness without acknowledging wrong, or order without acknowledging chaos, is impossible to uphold.

**【Nine】**
**Commentary:** Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, arise in mutual opposition; right and wrong, order and chaos, exist in mutual dependence. What, then, could one discard?

**Subcommentary:** To insist upon rightness without wrong, or Heaven without Earth, and to persist in such speech without ceasing—such a one is either utterly foolish or deliberately deceitful.

**Exegesis:** *Bù shě* (不舍): Pronounced *shě* (舍). The same below.

**[Ten]**
**Subcommentary:** The *Di* are the Five Emperors; the *Wang* are the Three Kings. The Three Dynasties are Xia, Yin, and Zhou. *Shàn* means "to transmit"; *jì* means "to continue." Some succeeded through lineage, while others yielded to different clans—hence the term "diverse transmissions." Some passed rule from father to son, while others seized power through rebellion—hence the term "diverse continuations." Some acted too hastily or too slowly, failing to align with Heaven’s timing; others lost the allegiance of the people, defying human affairs. Thus, Zihuai emulated Yao and Shun but lost his line, while the Duke of Bai imitated Tang and Wu yet perished—such cases are called "usurpations."

**Exegesis:** *Cuàn fū* (篡夫): Pronounced *chuàn* (初患反), meaning "to seize." Below, read as written.

**[Eleven]**
**Subcommentary:** Though warfare and yielding differ in form, their application varies with the times and cannot be rigidly held. For instance, Tang and Wu rose by force, while Yao and Shun yielded with courtesy—both accorded with Heaven’s Dao above and the people’s hearts below. Such acts are called "righteous."

**[Twelve]**
**Commentary:** What the world esteems may later be despised; what is deemed great in one age may be diminished in another.

Thus, following the traces of things, one cannot but diverge—this is why the Five Emperors and Three Kings differed. **Subcommentary:** The River Lord could not yet grasp the principle, so the Ocean Spirit rebuked him, urging silence and wordlessness, lest he waste breath in vain. For in matters of small and great, there is no fixed standard; in matters of noble and base, no set gate. The sentiments of things are inverted, and judgments are made recklessly. How then could you, woman, discern the gates of noble or base, great or small? The meaning is that she does not know.

**Exegesis:** *Nǚ è* (女恶) pronounced as *rǔ*; below, read as *wū*. **Collation:** (1) The missing text cites the Zhang Junfang edition, which adds *zhī* (之) beneath *cuàn* (篡). (2) The character *zhī* (之) is supplied from the Shidetang edition. (3) The two characters *chóng lèi* (重累) are amended following the *Wenxuan* commentary. (4) The character *bì* (痹) is amended following the *Guanzi*.

The River Lord said: "If so, then what should I do? What should I not do? How am I to decide in matters of speech and acceptance, pursuit and abandonment? What am I to do in the end?"

**[One]**
**[One] Subcommentary:** *Nài hé* (奈何) means "how" or "what to do." Though the River Lord comprehends the lofty principle, he has not yet grasped its ultimate purport, so he further seeks resolution of his doubts, hoping to hear an explanation. I wish to dwell in the world of men, safeguard my person, and cultivate the Dao—what should I do, and what should I not do? In matters of yielding and accepting, advancing and withdrawing, and the myriad affairs of things, how should I proceed? I beg your instruction, that I may follow it all my life.

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "From the perspective of the Dao, what is noble and what is base? This is called *fǎn yǎn*—reversal and recurrence. To constrain the will and cling to it is to greatly obstruct the Dao.

What is few and what is many? This is called *xiè shī*—alternation and application. To act with singular purpose is to be at odds with the Dao.

Solemn as a state with its ruler, yet without private virtue; reverent as a sacrifice with its altar, yet without private blessing; boundless as the four directions without end, without demarcation or boundary.

Embracing all things, who bears them up? This is called *wú fāng*—without fixed direction. All things are equal; what is short and what is long? The Dao has no end or beginning, while things have death and life, yet it does not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not abide in their forms.

Years cannot be lifted; time cannot be halted. Dissolution and growth, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is how we speak of the great principle’s direction and discuss the pattern of the myriad things.

The arising of things is like galloping, like racing—no movement without change, no moment without shift. What is to be done? What is not to be done? They will naturally transform of themselves."

**[One] Subcommentary:** *Fǎn yǎn* means "reversal and recurrence." Nobility and baseness arise from delusive attachment. When viewed through the principle of emptiness and penetration, the noble revert to baseness, and the base revert to nobility—hence it is called *fǎn yǎn*.

**[Two] Subcommentary:** *Ér* means "you." One who cultivates the Dao should act with spontaneity. Yet you constrain and cling to your will, holding fast with pride—thus you obstruct and fail to harmonize with the Dao of emptiness and penetration.

**[Three] Subcommentary:** *Xiè* means "to replace"; *shī* means "to apply." Things may gather the few to become many or scatter the many to become few, so their application alternates without constancy.

**[Four] Subcommentary:** Alternation and application, few and many, adapt to the moment, changing with the occasion—thus they equalize things. To act with singular purpose is to fail to merge with the principle.

**[Five] Subcommentary:** One who embodies the Dao appears majestic, guiding the myriad realms as a ruler guides a state. Nurturing the people, they bestow no private virtue.

**[Six] Subcommentary:** *Yóu yóu* describes their towering presence. Like the people’s sacrifices to the altar, the altar bestows no private blessing.

**[Seven] Subcommentary:** *Fàn fàn* describes their boundless reach. The sage’s resolve is impartial, aiding all beings with universal love. Like the four directions, vast and endless, how could there be boundaries or limits?

**[Eight] Subcommentary:** *Huái* means "to embrace"; *shú* means "who." The great sage’s compassion embraces all beings, yet their response is impartial—who would presume to support or uplift them?

**[Nine] Subcommentary:** Like a bright mirror or a deep valley, they adapt to every circumstance without fixed direction.

**[Ten] Subcommentary:** All things, though varied, are equally nurtured. The duck and the crane differ in length, yet each is sufficient in its nature.

**[Eleven] Subcommentary:** Death and life are but endless transformations, not true endings or beginnings. The Dao of emptiness and penetration has no end or beginning, while clinging things falsely calculate death and life. As the *Laozi* says: "Going ahead, one does not see its head; following behind, one does not see its tail."

**[Twelve] Subcommentary:** Responding to things without fixed direction, transcending and transforming alone—how could they rely on opposition to achieve completion?

**[Thirteen] Subcommentary:** They do not take form as their position and cling to it without change.

**[Fourteen] Subcommentary:** It is like yin and yang—spring gives life, autumn brings death; fullness and emptiness transform, flourishing and withering follow the seasons. How could one cling to form and skeleton, rigidly adhering to names and positions!

**[Fifteen] Annotation:** One wishes to lift it and make it depart, yet cannot.

**Explication:** *Lìng qù* (令去): *lìng* as in "command," *qù* rhyming with 呈 (*chéng*).

**[Sixteen] Annotation:** One wishes to halt it and make it stay, yet cannot.

**[Seventeen] Subcommentary:** Whether years are cut short or prolonged, whether time is fleeting or drawn out, all emerges from Heaven’s principle—it is not up to man. Thus, its coming cannot be lifted to make it depart, nor its going halted to make it stay; both must be entrusted to their course, for it has never been other than the self.

**[Eighteen] Annotation:** Transformation renews daily, never clinging to the old.

**[Nineteen] Subcommentary:** Yin wanes as yang waxes, summer’s fullness yields to winter’s emptiness; the qi’s sequence cycles endlessly, returning to its beginning. The Way of undifferentiated completion renews daily through transformation, proceeding straight ahead in accord with principle—no need for deliberate effort.

**[Twenty] Subcommentary:** The preceding discourse of Hai Ruo precisely expounds the meaning of the great Dao and elucidates the profound principle of the myriad things.

**[Twenty-One] Annotation:** One should simply follow its function.

**[Twenty-Two] Subcommentary:** Arising and perishing, flowing and fading—all ceaselessly in motion, swift as a gallop. Even a hundred years pass in a flash; why fixate on such things!

**[Twenty-Three] Annotation:** Thus, it cannot be grasped or clung to.

**[Twenty-Four] Subcommentary:** Flowing movement and transformation, the shifting of eras—swift as an arm’s turn, fleeting as a crack’s passage. Never has there been speech that moves without transformation, or words that mark time without change.

**[Twenty-Five] Annotation:** If one acts or refrains from acting amid these intervals, one disrupts their spontaneous transformation.

**[Twenty-Six] Subcommentary:** The myriad things, though tangled, all receive their nature from Heaven. At peace and entrusted to their course, they must transform of themselves—why trouble over acting or not acting!

**Textual Note:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *fàn* (泛).
(2) Zhao’s edition includes one additional character below.

River Lord said, "If so, then why value the Dao?"

**Annotation:** Because it transforms of itself.

**Subcommentary:** If acting and not acting were indistinguishable, then the principles of the common and the sage would be equal. Since one entrusts oneself to the spontaneity of transformation, why value the supreme Dao? The River Lord raises this question again, lingering over his doubt.

North Sea Lord said, "One who knows the Dao must penetrate principle; one who penetrates principle must be clear about adaptability; one who is clear about adaptability does not allow things to harm oneself.

The one of utmost virtue—fire cannot burn, water cannot drown, cold and heat cannot harm, birds and beasts cannot injure.

This does not mean one treats them lightly. It means discerning safety and danger, finding peace amid fortune and misfortune, being cautious in approach and retreat, so that nothing can harm one.

Thus it is said: Heaven is within, humanity without; virtue resides in Heaven.

Knowing the conduct of Heaven and humanity, rooted in Heaven, positioned in attainment—advancing and retreating, bending and extending, returning to the essential and speaking of the ultimate."

**Annotation:** One who knows the Dao knows its inability to act. If it cannot act, how could it generate me? I am born naturally, and my four limbs, hundred parts, five viscera, and spirit are already complete without acting—what further intention could there be after their formation?

One who penetrates this principle must be able to relinquish excessive knowledge, abandon the sentiment of preserving life, and ride transformation to respond with adaptability. Thus, one does not allow externals to injure the internal, nor things to harm oneself, and so remains constantly whole.

**Subcommentary:** One who can know the Dao of emptiness and penetration must penetrate the profound and mysterious principle of reality. One who penetrates this principle must be clear about the adaptability in responding to things. Having grasped the boundless nature of adaptability and reality, one can thus rest in transformation, untroubled by life and death. How could external things cause harm?

This answers the River Lord’s doubt and next clarifies the value of the supreme Dao.

**Annotation:** Where the mind finds peace, danger cannot endanger; where intention is without obstruction, suffering cannot afflict.

**Subcommentary:** The one of utmost virtue is one who has attained the supreme Dao. Though blending light with the world and dwelling in the dust of the vulgar, they are not assailed by the four seasons nor harmed by the three disasters. Having attained this internally, externals cannot injure them. This clarifies the value of understanding the Dao.

**Annotation:** Though the mind finds peace, one does not allow it to be violated.

**Subcommentary:** *Bó* means "to treat lightly." That water and fire do not invade, and birds and beasts do not harm, arises from the mind’s peace—what could injure cannot injure. Not only does one not avoid them, but one also does not treat them lightly.

**Annotation:** Knowing it cannot be escaped.

**Subcommentary:** That what could injure cannot injure is precisely because one discerns safety and danger, follows them without escape, and abides in constant accord.

**Annotation:** Finding peace in what fate encounters.

**Subcommentary:** *Nìng* means "peace." Misfortune is blockage and obstruction; fortune is passage and attainment. The one of utmost virtue follows whatever arises, embodying the mandate of fortune and misfortune, penetrating the gatelessness of fortune and misfortune. Thus, what they delight in is not fortune or misfortune, and what they encounter is always peace.

**Annotation:** Discerning what to approach and retreat from as not one’s own.

**Subcommentary:** Cautious in the indeterminacy of approach and retreat, discerning the timeliness of taking and abandoning—though following things in their changes, one always dwells in the most fitting.

**Annotation:** Not taking harm as harm, thus nothing can harm one.

**Subcommentary:** Unified in safety and danger, obscure in fortune and misfortune, moving with transformation—thus, nothing can injure. This summarizes the preceding meaning of being unharmed.

**Annotation:** The natural is within, and what the natural follows is without. Thus, the *Great Master* says, "One who knows what Heaven and humanity do attains the utmost." This clarifies that the division of internal and external is not a matter of acting.

**Subcommentary:** The natural nature is concealed within the heart; what human affairs follow lies in external traces—neither is a matter of acting. Entrusting oneself to spontaneity, thus nothing can harm one.

**Annotation:** Indulging human knowledge leads to dissipation and loss of the original.

**Subcommentary:** The beauty of utmost virtue lies in the natural. If one indulges human knowledge, the natural nature is dissipated.

**Annotation:** This is the knowledge of the natural, acting without exceeding its bounds. Thus, though acting externally, it is always rooted in Heaven and positioned in attainment.

**Subcommentary:** This is true knowledge. *Wèi* means "to dwell." Acting in the world with true knowledge, though encountering the myriad changes of things, one always takes the natural as the root, dwelling in emptiness and extremity without losing one’s nature—active yet tranquil.

**Annotation:** Responding to opportunities brings about these changes.

**Subcommentary:** *Zhí* describes the appearance of indecision in advance and retreat. The perfected one responds to the world, following the turbidity and clarity of things, now bending, now extending, without fixed attachment, meeting and parting in dark accord to suit the moment.

Though mingling among the common folk, the heart remains ever serene and still, ever abiding in the pivotal essence and returning to the root to restore the source. All speech arises from the utmost emptiness, movement never departing from stillness, words never departing from silence.

**Subcommentary:** *Fǎn yào* is pronounced *yú miào*.

**Collation:** A variant from the Jiangnan ancient repository reads *tiān* as *hū*.

He asked: "What is meant by Heaven? What is meant by man?"

**Subcommentary:** As the River Lord has not yet grasped the profound mystery, he raises this doubt, inquiring about the Way of Heaven and man, hoping for an answer to follow.

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "That oxen and horses have four legs is called Heaven; to bridle a horse’s head or pierce an ox’s nose is called man. Thus it is said: Do not let man obliterate Heaven, do not let the artificial obliterate fate, do not let attainment be sacrificed for fame. Guard this carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to one’s true nature."

**Annotation:** In life, can one do without yoking oxen or riding horses? And in yoking oxen or riding horses, can one do without piercing or bridling them? Oxen and horses do not refuse to be pierced or bridled, for this is the natural course of their fate. If it accords with fate, then though entrusted to human affairs, the root still lies in Heaven.

**Subcommentary:** Oxen and horses receive their four legs from Heaven, naturally, without relation to human affairs—thus this is called Heaven. To rein a horse’s head or pierce an ox’s nose arises from human intention—thus this is called man. Yet that an ox’s nose may be pierced or a horse’s head bridled, though they know not why, nor discern the cause, though the matter is entrusted to human sentiment, the principle ultimately returns to the Creator. To illustrate the unity of the Way of Heaven and man, he thus takes the two beasts, ox and horse, as examples.

**Annotation:** Piercing and bridling are permissible, but if one overworks them, driving them beyond measure or causing their steps to lose rhythm, then the heavenly principle is obliterated.

**Subcommentary:** To apply human affairs in accordance with nature is permissible for bridling and yoking. But if one pierces horses or bridles oxen contrary to creation, this may be called pursuing the falsity of human sentiment and obliterating the natural principle of Heaven.

**Annotation:** If one does not follow what arises spontaneously but instead acts with deliberate contrivance, where then is fate?

**Subcommentary:** To act in accord with one’s nature, without exceeding measure, is to reach a thousand miles while preserving fate. But if one spurs a nag to urge a steed, driving it beyond rhythm, this is to destroy the heavenly principle with human sentiment and artificial affairs, endangering life to the point of imminent ruin—where then is fate? Not only horses and oxen, but all things are thus.

**Annotation:** What one attains has its proper measure; to sacrifice it for fame is excess.

**Subcommentary:** Fame that may be sacrificed is boundless, while what one attains by nature is limited. If one sacrifices limited attainment for boundless fame, then the heavenly principle is obliterated and one’s nature and life are lost.

**Annotation:** The true lies within one’s inherent nature.

**Subcommentary:** Whether foolish or wise, short-lived or long-lived, impoverished or prosperous, honored or disgraced—all are received from nature, each having its proper measure. Only by carefully guarding and holding fast, not pursuing external things, attaining what lies within one’s measure without losing the Way, may one be said to return to the root and restore the source, recovering one’s true nature. This sentence summarizes the preceding profound principle.

Kui pities the centipede, the centipede pities the snake, the snake pities the wind, the wind pities the eye, the eye pities the heart.

**Subcommentary:** *Lián* means "to cherish" or "to esteem." Kui is a one-footed beast, its form like a drum, its foot resembling a human foot but with its heel turned forward. The *Shanhai Jing* states: "Within the Eastern Sea, there is Mount Liubo. On this mountain is a beast resembling an ox, dark in color, without horns, with one foot, that moves swiftly. Its voice is like thunder, and it is called Kui. Formerly, the Yellow Emperor, in his campaign against Chiyou, used Kui’s hide to cover a drum, and its sound carried five hundred miles." The centipede has many feet, and Kui, with few, envies its many—thus it pities the centipede. The centipede, having more than it lacks, pities the snake. The snake, small, envies the great—thus it pities the wind. The wind, dark, admires the bright—thus it pities the eye. The eye, external, admires the internal—thus it pities the heart. This illustrates that all things under Heaven receive their nature from the natural, and whether bright or dark, existent or nonexistent, there is no need for envy. Released and allowed to follow their course, they naturally accord with the mysterious Dao. Those who invert priorities, vainly admiring with deluded hearts, are thus presented with the coarse examples of Kui and the others to clarify the subtle principle of the heavenly mechanism.

Another interpretation: *lián* means "to pity." Kui, with one foot, leaps and bounds, and pities the centipede’s many feet as burdensome. The centipede, with feet, moves easily, and pities the snake’s footlessness as laborious. The snake, having form, enjoys comfort, and pities the wind’s formlessness as obscure. The wind, drifting freely, pities the eye’s confinement to form as stagnant. The eye, external and bright, pities the heart’s internal obscurity. This illustrates the inversion of things’ natures, vainly arising in pity, and thus takes Kui and the centipede as examples to cure such afflictions.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Kuí* is pronounced *qiú guī*, a one-footed beast. Li says: During the Yellow Emperor’s reign, the feudal lords on Mount Liubo in the Eastern Sea obtained a strange beast resembling an ox, dark in color, without horns, with one foot, that could run swiftly. Entering or exiting water brought wind and rain, its eyes shone like the sun and moon, and its voice was like thunder. It was called Kui. The Yellow Emperor killed it and took its hide to cover a drum, and its sound carried five hundred miles.
*Lián* is pronounced *lián*.
*Xiàn* is pronounced *xián*, or *xuán*. Sima says: It is the centipede. The *Guangya* says: *qū qú mǎ xiàn* (a kind of centipede).
*Sima says:* Kui has one foot; the centipede, many feet; the snake, no feet; the wind, no form.

The eye’s form is fixed here, yet its brightness flows there; the heart’s essence is subtle, its spirit roaming beyond. Kui said to the centipede: "With my single foot I stride and leap—nothing compares to me. Now you deploy ten thousand feet—how do you manage it?"

**[Note 1]**
**[Annotation 1]** *Striding and leaping* means bounding and prancing. I bound and prance with one foot, moving with joy, for the world is simple—none compare to me. Yet you drive ten thousand feet—are you not wearied by toil? How is your birth so unlike other creatures? This question is posed to reveal the workings of heaven’s mechanism.

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The modern text writes *zhuó* (踔) for *zhuó* (卓).

The *Guangya* says: *Zhuō* (踔) means “to transcend.” Li Shan’s commentary on the *Xidu Fu* notes: *Chuō* (逴) (*jiù jué* cut) and *lì* (跞) both mean “to surpass” or “to excel.” Their meanings are identical.

The millipede said: “Not so. Have you not seen one who spits? When ejected, the large droplets are like pearls, the small like mist, and those scattered in between are too numerous to count. Now, when I set my natural mechanism in motion, I do not know how it comes to be so.”

**[Annotation]**
**[1]** **[Exegesis]** When one spits, there is no deliberate intention regarding size, yet the sizes of the droplets naturally differentiate. Thus, the large are like pearls, the small like drifting mist, and the scattered fall in countless numbers. Now, the millipede’s multitude of feet are but the natural mechanism of heaven, moving and advancing without conscious effort—unintentional yet fully extended, much like the act of spitting. Kui posed the question from a human perspective, while the millipede answered directly from the workings of nature. The inherent principle is thus self-evident.

The millipede said to the snake, “I move with many feet, yet I do not match you who have no feet—why is this?”

**[Annotation]**
The millipede, with its many feet, is slow, while the snake, with no feet, is swift. Yet slowness and speed, presence and absence, are bestowed by creation. To clarify this principle, the question is thus raised.

The snake replied, “How can one alter the movement of the celestial mechanism? What need have I for feet?”

**[Commentary]**
When things come into being, they do not know they are being born. Likewise, when they move, do they know they are moving? Thus, the feet do not know how to walk, the eyes do not know how to see, and the mind does not know how to know—yet all proceed effortlessly of their own accord. The rhythm of slowness and speed, the clarity of perception, whether one excels or falls short—none of this belongs to me. Those who are deluded seek to claim their bodies and boast of their abilities, thereby resisting the celestial mechanism and harming their spiritual vessel. The perfected person knows the celestial mechanism cannot be altered, so they discard cleverness, abandon cunning, and, in utter oblivion, forget their actions and entrust themselves to spontaneous movement. Thus, in all things, there is no movement that is not free and unbound.

**[Annotation]**
The natural mechanism possesses this inherent function; slowness and speed, presence and absence, cannot be changed. Moving without intent, what need is there for feet?

The snake said to the wind, “When I move my spine and ribs to advance, there is something to it. Yet you arise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and rush into the Southern Sea, appearing as though nothing exists—why is this?”

The **Annotation** states: *Xié* (胁) means "ribs." *Péngpéng* (蓬蓬) denotes the sound of wind, or the appearance of dust stirred into motion. Since the snake has no feet, it must rely on the movement of its spine and ribs to advance. *Sì* (似) means "resemblance." Though the snake lacks feet, it possesses form and likeness, whereas the wind, formless and boundless, stirs without direction—from the Northern Sea to the Southern Sea, lashing the vast ocean, invisible yet forceful. The snake harbors this doubt and thus poses the question, hoping to hear the wind’s reply.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*Péngpéng* (蓬蓬): *bù dōng* (步东) *fǎn*, *xú fú gōng* (徐扶公) *fǎn*. Li [Yun] says: the appearance of wind.
◎ Jia Shifu notes: In the *Yùpiān*, *sì* (似) means "to resemble." That by which one moves is the feet; to move by means of the spine and ribs is to lack feet yet still resemble feet. What has form has resemblance; what is formless has nothing to resemble.

The wind replied: "Indeed. I arise *péngpéng* from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea. Yet if you point at me, you overpower me; if I contend with myself, I too am overpowered. Nevertheless, only I can snap great trees and topple vast halls—thus, my many small defeats are my great victory. To achieve such great victory is the sole province of the sage."

**Commentary:**
To follow the natural mechanism without contention is to be defeated in small things. Yet to harness the myriad things and govern the multitude of talents, allowing each talent to fulfill itself and each thing to act according to its nature, is to render all under heaven carefree—this is how the sage achieves great victory.

**Annotation:**
Though the wind travels from north to south, lashing the vast seas, if a person points a finger at it, the wind cannot break the finger; if one stamps a foot upon it, the wind cannot break the foot—these are its small defeats. Yet when a sudden whirlwind rises, twisting like a ram’s horn, it can send great halls flying and shatter sacred oaks—this is its great victory. It is like the enlightened sage who, though mingling with the foolish and stirring up dust amid the clamor of right and wrong, suffers small defeats. Yet in nurturing all living things and shaping the cosmos, matching the encompassing embrace of heaven and earth and the illuminating radiance of sun, moon, and stars, the sage achieves great victory. This is beyond the comprehension of ordinary minds; only the sage can attain it.

Confucius traveled to Kuang, where men of Song besieged him repeatedly, yet he continued his zither-playing and singing without pause.
Zilu entered to see him and asked, "Why does the Master remain so joyful?"

**Commentary:**
*Chuò* (辍) means "to cease." *Song* should be *Wei*, a scribal error. Kuang was a town in Wei. Confucius, traveling from Lu to Wei, passed through Kuang. Earlier, Yang Hu had raided and oppressed the people of Kuang, and Confucius resembled him in appearance. Moreover, Confucius’ disciple Yan Ke had once joined Yang Hu in oppressing Kuang and was now serving as Confucius’ charioteer. The people of Kuang, seeing Confucius’ resemblance to Yang Hu and Yan Ke driving his chariot, mistook him for Yang Hu’s return and thus mobilized troops to surround him. Confucius, understanding the inevitability of fate’s vicissitudes, continued his zither-playing and singing without interruption.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*Confucius traveled to Kuang, where men of Song besieged him repeatedly*: *sè zhǔ* (色主) reversed.
*Chuò* (辍): *zǐ hé* (子合) reversed.
Sima [Biao] says: *Song* should be *Wei*. Kuang was a town in Wei. The people of Wei mistakenly besieged Confucius, taking him for Yang Hu. Hu had once oppressed the people of Kuang, and Confucius’ disciple Yan Ke had been with him at the time. Later, Ke served as Confucius’ charioteer. Upon arriving in Kuang, the people recognized Ke, and seeing Confucius’ resemblance to Hu, they surrounded him.
*Bù chuò* (不惙): Another version writes *chuò* (辍), same pronunciation: *dīng liè* (丁劣) reversed.

[II] [Subcommentary] *Yú* (娱) means "joy." Since the people of Kuang had already surrounded him, by reason he should have been anxious and fearful—yet he continued his zither-playing and singing without cease. Why was this so? Not comprehending the Sage’s state of mind, they thus raised this question. Some versions also write *yú* (虞), meaning "anxiety." They wondered why the Master, though beset by cares, still did not cease his zither-playing and singing.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*Rù jiàn* (入見): *xián biàn* (賢遍) reversed.

**Textual Note:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s version writes *chuò* (辍).

Confucius said: "Come! Let me tell you. I have long avoided adversity, yet cannot escape it—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet cannot attain it—this is timing. (1) In the age of Yao and Shun, there were no men of adversity in the world, not because of their wisdom in gaining; in the age of Jie and Zhou, there were no men of success in the world, not because of their wisdom in losing. The circumstances of the times made it so. (2) He who travels by water without avoiding dragons and serpents is the courage of the fisherman; he who travels by land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers is the courage of the hunter; (3) he who faces crossed blades before him and regards death as life is the courage of the hero; (4) he who knows adversity is governed by fate, knows success comes with timing, and faces great peril without fear—this is the courage of the Sage. (5) You may rest now, for my fate is determined by what governs it."

[I] [Commentary] To clarify the inevitability of timing and fate, he thus speaks of seeking and avoiding.

[Subcommentary] *Huì* (讳) means "to shun" or "to resist." *Qióng* (穷) means "obstruction" or "adversity." *Tōng* (通) means "prosperity" or "success."

The Master summoned Zhong You and spoke to him of the ultimate principle, saying: "I have shunned adversity yet cannot escape it—is this not Heaven’s decree? I have long sought success yet cannot attain it—is this not due to the absence of an enlightened era? As for timing and fate, their coming cannot be resisted, their going cannot be detained. Thus, to be at ease and yield to them is to find harmony in all circumstances."

The Master wished to make this principle clear, so he framed it in terms of adversity and avoidance, though in truth there is no adversity to avoid.

[II] [Commentary] Do not weary the mind over adversity and success.

[Subcommentary] When one lives in the time of Yao and Shun, the world is at great peace, and people are like vessels, free within their allotted bounds—thus there is no obstruction. When one lives in the time of Jie and Zhou, the world is in violent chaos, and all things lose their nature—thus there are no successful men. Yet whether the times are level or perilous is determined by circumstances, not by the wisdom or folly of one’s fate, which brings such gains and losses.

[III] [Commentary] Each disposition finds its own peace.

[Subcommentary] When one’s disposition finds peace, fear is forgotten. This begins the analogy.

[IV] [Commentary] The Sage finds peace in all things.

[Subcommentary] The Sage understands timing and fate, grasps adversity and success, and thus remains courageous amid peril without ever being unsettled. This concludes the analogy.

[V] [Commentary] Fate is not self-determined, so there is no need to exert the mind. One who is at peace with fate finds freedom wherever they go; thus, even in Kuang, Chen, or Youli, it is no different from resting in the Purple Ultimate’s tranquil hall.

[Subcommentary] *Chǔ* (处) means "to rest" or "to dwell in peace." *Zhì* (制) means "allotted bounds" or "predetermined limits." He admonished Zilu, instructing him to set his mind at ease: "I am endowed with Heaven’s mandate, which has its own limits—how could human effort alter it?"

[Glossary Notes]
*Xián táng* (闲堂): pronounced *xián*. [Variant Readings] (1) The *Quewu* cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript as reading *yù* (遇). (2) The *Quewu* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition as adding *zhī shí* (之时) after "Yao and Shun" and likewise after "Jie and Zhou."

After no great while, armored soldiers advanced and declared: "We mistook you for Yang Hu, and so we surrounded you. Now that we see it is not so, we beg leave to withdraw." [Subcommentary] *Wú jǐhé* (无几何) means "a brief moment." Once they realized it was Master Xuan Ni rather than Yang Hu, the commanders and their armored troops came forward, bowed in apology, acknowledged their error, and lifted the siege.

Gongsun Long questioned Wei Mou, saying: "In my youth I studied the Dao of the former kings; in maturity I clarified the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I unite sameness and difference, separate hardness and whiteness; I affirm the un-affirmed, approve the un-approved..."

"I have confounded the wisdom of the Hundred Schools and exhausted the debates of all disputants—I once believed myself to have attained ultimate comprehension. Yet now, hearing the words of Master Zhuang, I am bewildered and struck with wonder. Do I fall short in discourse, or does my understanding pale in comparison? Now I find myself at a loss for words; I venture to ask: what is the Way?"

[Subcommentary 1] *Gongsun* is his clan name, *Long* his given name; he was a native of Zhao. *Wei Mou* was a prince of Wei, one who embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue, disdaining the filth of the world. "Former kings" refers to the legacies of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang. "Benevolence and righteousness" are the practices of the Five Virtues. Gongsun Long, endowed with keen intelligence and a talent for grand disputation, composed the *Discourse on Guarding the White* and gained renown for his dialectical skill. Thus he could unite difference as sameness and separate sameness as difference; affirm the un-affirmed and approve the un-approved. He challenged the writings of all schools, overpowering them, and silenced every debater, leaving none unvanquished. Born in the declining Zhou, he stood peerless in his time. Disciples such as Kong Chuan revered and followed him, and his name resounded through the age—none dared contest him. Thus he boasted of his learning, believing it to have reached the utmost subtlety. Yet upon encountering Zhuangzi, he was like a frog at the bottom of a well.

[Phonetic Gloss] *Gongsun Long wen yu Wei Mou*: Sima [Biao] says: Long was a man of Zhao; Mou was a prince of Wei. *Shao xue* (少学): *shi* as in *shizhao* (诗照). *Zhang er* (长而): *zhang* as in *zhangzhang* (张丈). *Zhi xing* (之行): *xing* as in *xiameng* (下孟). *Zhi zhi* (之知): *zhi* pronounced *zhi* (智).

[Subcommentary 2] *Hui* means "mouth." *Fang* means "Dao/Way." Though Gongsun Long excelled in rhetoric, he had not yet grasped the profound emptiness of the Dao. Thus, upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, he was stunned by their strangeness and suddenly realized the shallowness of his own learning, awakening to the depth of Zhuangzi’s speech. Was it merely that his arguments were inferior, or did his intellect and capacity also fall short? Hence he sealed his lips and humbly sought further instruction from Wei Mou.

【Pronunciation Notes】*Mang yan* (茫焉): *mang* as in *mogang* (莫刚), Guo [Xiang] reads *mang* (莽). *Lun zhi* (论之): *lun* as in *likun* (力困). *Ji yu* (及与): pronounced *yu* (余). The following auxiliary phrases follow this pattern. *Suo kai* (所开): read as written; also written as *guan* (关), both acceptable. Alternatively written as *he* (阂). *Wu hui* (吾喙): *hui* as in *xuhui* (许秽), or *changrui* (昌锐).

Prince Mou leaned against his desk, sighed deeply, looked up to the sky, and laughed, saying: "Have you alone not heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea: 'How joyful I am! I leap and bound upon the well’s ledge, then rest at the edge of its broken bricks. When I enter the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I trample the mud, it buries my feet and covers my insteps. I turn to the shrimp, crabs, and tadpoles—none can compare to me. Moreover, to monopolize the water of a single ravine and straddle the joy of this shallow well—this is perfection itself! Why do you not come in from time to time to see for yourself?'

The turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet placed its left foot inside when its right knee was already stuck. Thereupon it retreated and withdrew, then told the well-frog of the sea: 'A distance of a thousand *li* is insufficient to convey its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* is insufficient to measure its depth. In the time of Yu, floods came nine years out of ten, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, drought struck seven years out of eight, yet the shores did not diminish. Unchanged by the passage of moments or ages, unmoved by abundance or scarcity—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.'

Upon hearing this, the frog in the shallow well was startled and dumbfounded, utterly at a loss."

The noble scion embodied the Dao in purity and loftiness, transcending the mundane world. He discerned the shallow sophistry of Sun Long and perceived the profound words of Zhuangzi. Thus, he sighed toward heaven and scoffed in amusement, citing the two parables of the frog and the turtle to clarify the victory and defeat of the two.

The "shallow well" refers to a shallow pit. The "frog" is a toad. The *gan* is the well’s railing. The *zhou* are the bricks layered within the well. The *fu* is the instep of the foot. The *huan* means to glance back. The *han* is a red worm in the well, also said to be a cocooned grub. The *xie* is a small crab. The *kedou* are tadpoles. The *ye* is beneath the arm. The *yi* is beneath the mouth.

The turtle of the Eastern Sea, vast and immense in form, roams and plays upon the waves, dwelling briefly upon the flatlands. Yet the toad and the tiny creatures, confined to the shallow well—both inferior in form and cramped in dwelling—believed themselves content within the well. Unafraid even upon seeing the great turtle, they declared:

"When I emerge, I leap and prance upon the well’s railing; when I enter, I rest beside the broken bricks. Swimming, I touch my armpits and support my chin; wading through mud, I sink my insteps and submerge my feet. Glancing around at creatures like shrimp and crabs, gazing down at the tadpoles below—carefree and joyous, none compare to me."

**Section Two**
**Commentary:** This is like a small bird contenting itself among the reeds.
**Exegesis:** *Shan* means "to monopolize." *Zhi* means "to rest." The frog addresses the turtle as "Master," saying: "I alone monopolize the water of this gully and rest content in the joy of this shallow well—nothing in the world is more satisfying than this. Though my dwelling is humble, it allows for swimming and wading. Why not step down for a moment, Master, and visit this lowly abode?" Thus it boasts and vaunts itself before the turtle.

**Phonetic and Lexical Notes:**
*Fu shan* (《夫擅》): pronounced *shì zhàn* (市战反), meaning "to monopolize."
*Yi he* (《一壑》): pronounced *huǒ gè* (火各反).

**Section Three**
**Commentary:** This illustrates that the great does not roam in the small—not out of delight in doing so.
**Exegesis:** *Zhi* means "to restrain." The shallow well is narrow, while the sea turtle is immense. To embrace the vast within the small is impossible in principle, so no sooner had its right knee descended than it was already constrained. Thus:

**Phonetic and Lexical Notes:**
*Yi zhi* (《已絷》): pronounced *zhū lì* (猪立反).
Sima [Biao] says: It means "to restrain." The *Sancang* says: It means "to fetter."
*Fei le* (《非乐》): pronounced *yuè* (音岳), also *wǔ jiào* (五教反).

**Section Four**
**Exegesis:** *Qunxun* means "leisurely." Seven *chi* make one *ren*. With its left foot not yet entered and its right knee already restrained, the turtle retreated in hesitation and described to the frog the vastness of the sea. Those who consider a thousand *li* distant have not yet grasped the breadth of the sea; those who deem a thousand *ren* high have not yet fathomed its depths.

The vastness and depth of the sea are beyond human measurement—yet you take this pitiful well as the ultimate limit. How inferior this is!

**Phonetic and Lexical Notes:**
*Qun* (《逡》): pronounced *qī xún* (七旬反).

**Section Five**
**Exegesis:** *Qǐng* means "a brief moment," while *jiǔ* means "a long time." *Tuīyí* means "to change and transform." When Yao faced the great flood, he commanded Yu to govern it with success, hence the reference to the age of Yu. Yet in Yao’s ten years, nine were plagued by floods; in Tang’s eight years, seven suffered drought. Though drought came, the cliffs did not diminish; though floods rose, the waters did not increase. This makes clear that the boundless expanse of the sea, its fathomless depths, are not altered by moments or ages, nor do they advance or recede with quantity. Is not the joy of the Eastern Sea found here?

**Phonetic and Lexical Notes:**
*Jiǔ lǎo* (《九潦》): pronounced *lǎo* (音老).
*Fú wéi* (《弗为》): pronounced *yú wěi* (于伪反). The same below.
*Qǐng jiǔ* (《顷久》): Sima [Biao] says: "It means 'early or late.'"

**Section Six**
**Commentary:** To admire the great from the small is to lose oneself.

**Exegesis:** *Shìshì* describes a look of alarm; *guīguī*, a demeanor of self-loss. The frog, boasting of the well’s beauty, claimed nothing in the world surpassed it. But upon hearing the sea turtle’s words, it was stunned, bereft of its former certainty—hence its *shìshì* and *guīguī* demeanor, alarmed and self-lost. Now, Master Gongsun Long studied the Way of the former kings, upheld the practice of benevolence and righteousness, confounded the wisdom of the hundred schools, and exhausted the eloquence of all debaters. Yet upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, he was like the well-frog encountering the sea turtle.

**Phonetic and Lexical Notes:**
*Shìshì* (《适适》): pronounced *shǐ chì* (始赤反), also *zhàng gé* (丈革反); Guo [Xiang] reads *yú dí* (郭菟狄反).
*Guīguī* (《规规》): read as written, or *xū yì* (虚役反); Li [Yi] and Xu [Kai] read *jì shuì* (徐纪睡反). *Shìshì* and *guīguī* both describe a startled gaze and self-loss.

**Textual Variants:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *frog* (蛙).
(2) The Shide Tang edition omits *chū* (出) in "jump up," matching the lacuna; the Jiangnan ancient manuscript reads *chū tiào* (出跳), omitting *liáng* (梁).

Moreover, if one does not even know the limits of right and wrong yet still wishes to examine Zhuangzi’s words, it is like making a mosquito bear a mountain or a centipede race across a river—surely beyond its strength.

Furthermore, if one does not comprehend the ultimate subtlety of discourse yet seeks only momentary advantage, is this not the same as the well-frog?

For the Dao strides across the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Emperor, unbound by south or north, utterly liberated in all four directions, merging into the unfathomable. Unconfined by east or west, it begins in profound obscurity and returns to great penetration. Yet you seek to measure it with narrow scrutiny and probe it with debate—is this not like using a tube to view the sky or a awl to point at the earth? How petty!

Go now! Have you not heard of the young men of Shouling who went to Handan to learn its walk? Before mastering the state’s skill, they lost their own way and could only crawl home. If you do not leave now, you will forget your original path and lose your former learning.

**Commentary:** All things have their proper measure; one cannot forcibly emulate what is beyond them.

The *shangju* is the centipede, also called *shangju*, or *juqu*. Though Sun Long possessed keen intelligence and natural discernment, his was but worldly knowledge, not true understanding. Thus, to one who has not yet exhausted the realm of right and wrong yet seeks to scrutinize the profound words of Zhuangzi—how does this differ from making a mosquito bear a mountain or a *shangju* race across rivers and seas? Their strength is too feeble for their burden, their wisdom too slight for their ambition; they are surely unequal to the task.

**Exegetical Note:** Sun Long’s learning was narrow and shallow of mind—how could he presume to discuss Zhuangzi’s words, which plumb the subtlest depths? He could only parse right and wrong to chase fleeting fame and profit. To take this as the Dao—is this not like the frog in the shallow well? This concludes the analogy.

**Commentary:** It speaks of that which reaches everywhere.

**Exegetical Note:** *Ci* means to transcend, or to reach the utmost. *Taihuang* is Heaven. *Xuanming* is the wondrous root. *Datong* is the responsive trace. Zhuangzi’s words exhaust the subtleties of principle, ascending to the heights of the azure vault and descending to the depths of the Yellow Springs, traversing the four directions and eight limits with boundless freedom. This wisdom is hidden and unfathomable, beginning in the profoundest obscurity and returning to great penetration, its Dao darkly merging with all things.

**Phonetic Glosses:** *Fangci*: read *ci*; Guo reads *shizi*, also *zemai*. *Guangya* says: to tread, to step, to trample. Sima says: to fathom. *Taihuang*: read *tai*. *Shiran*: read *shi*. *Sijie*: read *humai*. ◎ Qingfan notes: "Unbound by east or west" loses the rhyme; the present text is a later corruption. Wang Niansun says: It should read "Unbound by west or east," rhyming with *tong*. (For example, in the *Da Ya*’s *Huang Yi* ode, "with your brothers" originally rhymed with "king," but now reads "brothers." In the *Yi Zhou Shu*’s *Zhou Zhu* chapter, "harsh and yielding, firm and soft" originally rhymed with "bright and dark, long and short," but now reads "firm and yielding." In the *Guanzi*’s *Nei Ye* chapter, "Can one know good and ill fortune without divination?" originally rhymed with "one," but now reads "ill fortune." In the *Fu Niao Fu*, "some rush east and west" originally rhymed with "same," but now reads "west and east." In the *Da Ke Nan*, "granaries without" originally rhymed with "offering," but now reads "granaries." All these are later corruptions by those who failed to grasp ancient rhymes and altered them at will.)

[4] **Annotation:** Those who roam the boundless cannot be grasped by discernment or debate.
**Exegesis:** *Suo* in *suozhi* is pronounced with the entering tone *bai*.

[5] **Annotation:** If a task is not one’s own, it may be abandoned.
**Subcommentary:** *Guigui* describes the appearance of scheming. To seek the Dao through observation, or to approach it with eloquent discourse and unadulterated sincerity—even if one applies the most meticulous care, one remains far from it. It is like gazing at the heavens through a tube: how could one know their vastness? Or probing the earth with an awl: how could one fathom its depths? Zhuangzi’s Dao harmonizes with the Two Modes; Sun Long’s virtue is no greater than an awl or tube. The disparity in wisdom and capacity is so vast that, since one cannot match him, it is best to depart swiftly.

[6] **Annotation:** To model oneself on another is to lose both.
**Subcommentary:** Shouling was a town in Yan; Handan, the capital of Zhao. *Yuzǐ* refers to youths not yet of age. The customs of Handan were renowned for their walking style, so young men from Yan traveled far to learn it. Yet, having forsaken their nature, they failed to master Zhao’s skill; in imitating others, they lost even their own way. Thus, they ended up crawling home on hands and knees.
**Exegesis:** Sima Biao says: *Shouling* is a town name. *Yuzǐ* refers to those not yet of age for corvée. *Han* is pronounced *han*; *Dan*, *dan*. Handan was the capital of Zhao. ◎ Qing Fan notes: *Yuzǐ* are the younger sons of the people. The *Rites of Zhou*’s *Minor Controller of the Multitude* states: for major state affairs, all citizens are summoned; for great emergencies, even *yuzǐ* are called. Zheng Sinong explains: *Yuzǐ* are surplus troops, so named because they are extra soldiers. In major affairs, the regular troops are summoned; in emergencies, even the surplus are called. The *Lost Books of Zhou*’s *Tiao Kuang* chapter says: in years of plenty, *yuzǐ* practice the arts; in lean years, *yuzǐ* cultivate the fields; in famine years, *yuzǐ* assist in transport. The *Book of Han*’s *Treatise on Food and Goods* also mentions *yuzǐ* in the sequence of studies. Su Lin says: those not yet liable for service are *yuzǐ*—this aligns with Sima’s “not yet of age for corvée.” *Pu* is pronounced *pu*, or *fu*; *fu*, *pubei*, or *fu*.

[7] **Subcommentary:** Zhuangzi’s Dao crowns the profound mystery, transcending all bounds; though Sun Long’s discourse is vast and eloquent, it remains within the world’s confines. Thus, to study Zhuangzi through Sun Long’s words is to grasp nothing of principle. If one’s heart stirs with longing and hesitation, never returning, one will surely lose one’s own learning and forget one’s original steps. This is the fitting analogy.
**Collation:** (1) The Zhao Jianyi edition includes the character *ye* (also).

[The text continues:]
Gongsun Long’s mouth gaped without closing, his tongue lifted without lowering—then he fled in haste.
**Subcommentary:** *Qū* means “to open.” *Yì* means “to flee.” Having heard Zhuangzi’s discourse, which surpassed all hearing and sight, and then encountering Wei Mou’s teachings, which transcended words and forms—

Within, distinctions arose; without, barriers stood—matters beyond Sun Long’s ken. Thus his mouth gaped without closing, his tongue lifted without lowering, and so his spirit wandered in disarray while his body fled in haste.

**Explication of Terms:**
*Kou qu* (口呿): *qu* rhymes with *ju* (據). Sima [Biao] says: “to open.” Li [Yi] reads it as *qu* (袪), also pronounced *jue* (巨劫).

Zhuangzi was angling at Pu River when the King of Chu dispatched two grandees to approach him first, saying: “I wish to burden you with the cares of my realm!”

**Subcommentary:**
Pu is the name of a river, belonging to Dong Commandery; present-day Puyang County in Pu Prefecture. The King of Chu was King Wei of Chu. Zhuangzi’s heart dwelt in nonaction, yet he lodged his traces in angling. The King of Chu, knowing Zhuangzi’s worth and wisdom, sought to bend him to serve as minister and counselor. Thus he dispatched envoys bearing jades and silks, sending them to Pu River to first declare his intent: he wished to entrust the realm’s borders to a worthy man, for the king’s affairs were many and not without their burdens and cares.

**Explication of Terms:**
*Pu River* (濮水): pronounced *bo* (卜), a river in Chen territory.
*King of Chu* (楚王): Sima [Biao] says: King Wei.
*First* (先焉): to declare one’s words beforehand.

Zhuangzi held his rod and did not turn, saying: “I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise, dead now three thousand years, which the king keeps wrapped in silk and stored in a casket upon the ancestral altar. This tortoise—would it rather have died to leave its bones honored, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?”

**Subcommentary:**
The tortoise possesses numinous power, so it is hollowed out for divination, able to decide fortune and misfortune. It is placed in a casket, covered with silk, and stored in the ancestral temple to divine state affairs—thus is it treasured and honored. The question is: “Would this tortoise rather preserve its life and flee harm, dragging its tail through the mire, or would it prefer to be hollowed of its bones to gain renown, honored in the ancestral temple?” Thus did Zhuangzi deeply grasp this truth, and so he haughtily paid no heed.

«**Exegetical Notes**»
*《巾笥》* Xīsì, variant reading Sī.
*《而藏之》* Li [Yun] says: “Stored in a casket, covered with silk.”

Two grandees said: “Better to live and drag one’s tail through the mire.”
**Subcommentary:**
The grandees answered Zhuangzi according to their nature: they deemed it fitting to live and drag one’s tail, not to die and leave one’s bones.

Zhuangzi said: “Go! I shall drag my tail through the mire.”
**Annotation:**
Each finds rest in what accords with its nature.
**Subcommentary:**
Zhuangzi preserved his lofty, far-reaching aspiration, prizing the carefree heart of mountains and seas. Like the marsh pheasant nurturing its nature, he equated himself to the mud-dragging tortoise. Thus he bade the messenger depart swiftly, that he might fully realize his non-action.

When Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him.
**Subcommentary:**
Surnamed Hui, given name Shi, a native of Song, he served as prime minister to King Hui of Liang. Hui Shi was broadly learned and rich in knowledge, skilled in disputing names and analyzing principles. As he was Zhuangzi’s friend, Zhuangzi went to call on him.
**Exegetical Notes**
*《惠子相》* Huìzǐ xiàng, same below.
*《梁》* Prime minister to King Hui of Liang.

Here, some visitor from Liang, knowing Zhuangzi’s surpassing talent and great virtue, warned Huizi: "The king will surely honor him with ceremony. Fearing rivalry for the prime minister’s seat, he told Huizi that Zhuangzi had come to replace him."

**Commentary:**
Deploying troops and marshaling ranks.
**Subcommentary:**
Hearing this report from a countryman, Huizi took it as truth. His heart filled with dread, fearing imminent peril, he deployed troops and marshaled ranks, searching the state for three days and nights to find Zhuangzi.

**Exegetical Notes**
*《子恐》* qī yǒng fǎn.
*《》* The character also appears as 搜 or 廋. *Suǒ qiú* fǎn, *Lǐ xī gōu* fǎn: "to seek." *Shuōwén* states: "to search."
◎Lú Wénchāo notes: The modern text reads 搜.

Zhuangzi went to see him and said: "In the south there is a bird called the yuānchú—do you know it? The yuānchú sets forth from the Southern Sea and flies to the Northern Sea. It alights only on the wútóng tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only from sweet springs. Then a chī, having found a rotting rat, sees the yuānchú pass by and looks up, crying, *'Hè!'* Now do you mean to frighten me with your state of Liang?"

**Subcommentary:**
The yuānchú is of the luan-phoenix kind, also called "phoenix fledgling." *Liànshí* is bamboo fruit. *Lǐquán* is a spring as sweet as sweet wine. *Hè* is the sound of anger and rejection. Huizi, fearing Zhuangzi would seize his position, had marshaled troops and deployed forces. Zhuangzi therefore went to see him and set forth this parable. The phoenix is a southern bird, an auspicious creature that appears in response to virtue. It alights only on the wútóng, rests only by the vast sea, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only from sweet springs. Yet a common kite, having chanced upon a foul rat, prides itself on its prize and looks up, crying *hè* at the phoenix. This is like Huizi, mired in glory and splendor, his heart set on the prime minister’s seat—how could he understand Zhuangzi’s lofty purity, his lack of desire to contend?

**Exegetical Notes**
*《鹓》* yú yuān fǎn.
*《雏》* chì jū fǎn.

Li Yun states: The *yuānyū* is of the same kind as the *luán* and phoenix.
*Lǐquán* is pronounced *lǐ*.
Li Yun states: A spring as sweet as sweet wine.
*Hè* is also written as *hū*, both identical.
Pronounced *xù jià* or *xǔ bó*.
Sima states: *Hè* is the sound of anger, fearing the other will seize what is theirs.
The *Shijing* commentary states: To repel someone with the mouth is called *hè*.

**Note [2]**
**Commentary:** Things have different tastes and desires; each has its own limit.

**Exegesis:** The owl takes a rotten rat as fine fare and looks up, crying *hè* at the *yuānyū*; Huizi takes the prime minister’s seat as glory and suspects Zhuangzi. This summarizes the preceding parable.

**Exegetical Notes**
*《嗜》* shì.
*《好》* hào.

Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on the bridge over the Hao River.
Zhuangzi said: "The *tiáo* fish swim leisurely—this is the joy of fish."

**Note [1]**
**Exegesis:** The Hao is the name of a river, in Zhongli Prefecture of Huainan. Today, Zhuangzi’s tomb is still visible, as is the place where Zhuangzi and Huizi once wandered. A bridge of stone spans the water—this is also called the bridge over the Hao River, where Zhuangzi and Huizi engaged in pure discourse.

**Exegetical Notes**
*《豪梁》* is also written as *濠梁*, same pronunciation.
Sima states: The Hao is the name of a river. A bridge of stone spanning water is called a *liáng*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: In modern editions, *豪* is written as *濠*.

**Note [2]**
**Exegesis:** The *tiáo* fish are white *tiáo*. *Cóngróng* describes their unhurried, carefree manner. Fish swim in water, birds perch on land—each follows its nature, and all things are free. Zhuangzi, deeply attuned to the feelings of things, thus knew the fish were joyful.

**Exegetical Notes**
*《倏鱼》* Xu pronounces as *tiáo*. The *Shuowen* gives *zhí liú*. Li pronounces as *yóu*, the white fish. The *Erya* states: *Jiū* is the black *□*. Guo’s commentary: This is the white *tiáo*. Another pronunciation is *xiǎo*, referring to the white *tiáo* fish.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: *倏* should be written as *鲦*, with the same pronunciation in the commentary. This text often mixes them. Also, *jiū* is the black *□*. Formerly written as *□*, now corrected according to the *Erya*.
*《从容》* qī róng.
*《鱼乐》* lè. The same in the commentary and below.

Huizi said: "You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?"

**Note [1]**
**Exegesis:** Huizi, not understanding the nature of things, rashly raises a doubt: Zhuangzi is not a fish—how could he know the fish’s joy?

Zhuangzi said: "You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?"

**Note [1]**
**Commentary:** This is meant to illustrate the principle that things are mutually distinct and cannot know one another. You are not me, yet you can know I am not a fish; thus, I am not a fish, yet I can know the fish’s joy.

**Exegesis:** If, because I am not a fish, I cannot know the fish, then since you are not me, how can you know me? If you, though not me, can know me, then though I am not a fish, why can I not know the fish? This reversal refutes the objection, leaving no room for difficulty.

Huizi said: "I am not you, so of course I do not know you. You are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete."

**Note [1]**
**Commentary:** He abandons the original point and engages in sophistry to press his argument.

**Exegesis:** Huizi is not Zhuangzi, so he does not know Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi is surely not a fish—how could he know the fish’s joy? The principle that one who is not joyful cannot know joy remains unshaken. He abandons the original argument and resorts to sophistry to press his point.

**Exegetical Notes**
*《以难》* nàn.

Zhuangzi said: "Let us return to the beginning. When you said, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’ you already knew I knew it when you asked me. I knew it here, on the bridge over the Hao."

**Note [1]**
**Exegesis:** *Xún* means to trace.

Hui Shi engaged in sophistry, uttering words without principle, abandoning the root to chase the branches, and losing the essence of his argument. Let us trace back to the source, and the difficulty will naturally dissolve. The meaning of returning to the root is expounded below.

**Note [2]**
**Commentary:** Tracing back to Hui Shi’s original statement: "If you are not a fish, then there is no way for you to know it. Now you are not me, yet you say, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’—this shows you know I am not a fish. If you know I am not a fish, then in all cases of mutual knowing, one may indeed know the other in this way, without needing to be a fish oneself to know the fish. Thus, following your question ‘How do you know?’—you already knew what I knew. Yet now you ask me again, and I simply know it here on the Hao. Why must I enter the water?"

That which a creature finds natural in its birth and at ease in its place—heaven and earth cannot alter its dwelling, yin and yang cannot reverse its nature. Thus, to know the joy of water-dwellers from the ease of land-dwellers is hardly the height of subtlety.

**Exegesis:** "You said" refers to Zhuangzi quoting Hui Shi’s words. When Hui Shi said, "You are not a fish, so how do you know the joy of fish?"—this sufficiently proves that Hui Shi, not being Zhuangzi, knew that Zhuangzi did not know the fish. Moreover, since you are not me yet know me, and knowing me, you ask me—why then should it be impossible for me, not being a fish, to know the fish, and knowing the fish, to sigh for its joy? Though the natures of creatures differ and the conditions of water and land are distinct, one who grasps the principle embodies their feelings. Thus, wandering by the Hao, I know the fish’s contentment and joy. In observing all things, must one enter the water? Therefore, through the two worthies, Zhuangzi and Hui Shi, the great essence of discourse is illustrated.

**Collation Note**

**Outer Chapters: "Ultimate Joy" (Chapter Eighteen)**
**Exegetical Notes**
*《乐》* lè (joy).

Is there in the world an ultimate joy, or is there not? Is there a way to preserve life, or is there not? Now, what should one do, and on what rely? What should one avoid, and where dwell? What should one pursue, and what forsake? What should one delight in, and what detest?

**Commentary:** Only after forgetting joy does joy become complete; only when joy is complete does the body endure. Shall we say there is joy? Yet ultimate joy is without delight. Shall we say there is no joy? Yet the body endures without sorrow.

**Exegesis:** This is a hypothetical question. *至* means "ultimate," *乐* means "joy." Within the realm, is there an ultimate joy that can nourish and preserve life, or is there not?

**Exegetical Notes**
*《至乐》* lè (joy). Throughout the chapter, where the pronunciation is not specified, it is the same.
*至* means "ultimate," *乐* means "joy."

**Commentary:** Choosing among these eight—none suffices to preserve life. Only by making no choice and following what one encounters can wholeness be attained.

**Exegesis:** *奚* means "what." If one wishes to practice the Way of ultimate joy to preserve life, what should one do, what rely upon, what avoid, where dwell, what pursue, what forsake, what delight in, and what detest to accord with the Way of ultimate joy? This is a hypothetical question, and the answer will be revealed below.

**Exegetical Notes**
*《奚恶》* wù.

The *Shide Tang* edition includes the character *者* after *遇*, while the *Zhao Jianyi* edition omits it.

What the world reveres are wealth, honor, longevity, and goodness; what it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and harmonious sounds. What it disdains are poverty, lowliness, early death, and wickedness. What it suffers are the inability to rest in ease, to savor rich flavors, to wear fine garments, to behold beauty, or to hear music. If these are unattainable, one is gripped by great sorrow and fear. How foolish it is to shape one’s form thus!

**Exegesis:** What the world reveres above all are abundant wealth, exalted rank, long life, and a virtuous reputation. What it delights in are flavors that please the palate, garments that adorn the body, colors that delight the eye, and sounds that charm the ear. Those who attain these cling to them as sources of joy.

**Exegesis:** Poverty, lowliness, early death, and a wicked name are deemed the lowest in the world.

**Commentary:** None of these, when lost, harms the form, yet their pursuit damages one’s nature. To grieve over their absence is sheer folly.

**Exegesis:** None of these things benefit a person, yet the common folk suffer when they lack them, finding no contentment and falling into sorrow, fear, and anxiety. To cultivate one’s form in this way—how utterly foolish!

The wealthy exhaust their bodies in toil, amassing riches they cannot fully use. How far they stray from their true form!

**Commentary:** To preserve one’s form, one need only know contentment.

**Exegesis:** The rich and powerful labor their minds and bodies, racing to accumulate wealth, hoarding it without spending. How could this be the way to nurture one’s form?

The honored pass their days and nights in ceaseless thought, weighing right and wrong. How distant they are from their true form!

**Commentary:** Thus, only by relinquishing life can one forget sorrow; only by forgetting sorrow can life become joyful. Only then does the form belong to oneself, wealth to oneself, and honor to oneself.

**Exegesis:** Born with a dull and troubled nature, one is burdened by sorrow from the start. Even the long-lived grow muddled, enduring endless sorrow without death. What torment! To shape one’s form in this way—how far it strays from the Way of ultimate joy!

The steadfast strive for the world’s approval, yet this is not enough to preserve their lives. Do I know whether such goodness is truly good or not? If it is good, it does not suffice to preserve life; if it is not good, it may suffice to preserve others.

**Commentary:** Goodness must be fitting; thus, it does not universally aid.

**Exegesis:** *Cheng* means "truth." Loyal and steadfast individuals sacrifice themselves for principle, their names enduring through the ages, seen as virtuous in the world. Yet we do not know whether this goodness is real or illusory. If it is real, it does not preserve one’s life; if it is illusory, it should not sustain others. Relying on remonstrance to bring peace may preserve others, but dying for loyalty does not preserve oneself.

Thus it is said: "If loyal admonition goes unheeded, withdraw and do not contend."

**Commentary:** Only the virtue of the mean is fitting.

**Exegesis:** The way of a minister is this: if the ruler is without the Dao, one should admonish with a loyal heart. If the ruler does not heed the advice, one must withdraw and cease, for contending against the ruler’s wrath invites execution.

**Exegesis:** When King Fuchai of Wu indulged in excess and folly, Wu Zixu remonstrated with loyalty and was put to death. Had he not remonstrated, his loyal name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there not?

**Commentary:** Thus, one should follow the central path as one’s guiding principle.

**Exegesis:** King Fuchai of Wu, licentious and without the Dao, executed Wu Zixu for his loyal remonstrance. Had Zixu not contended, his name for loyalty would not have been established.

Thus, whether to admonish or not, whether it is good or not, is truly not yet settled.

What the common world pursues and delights in, I do not yet know: is their delight truly delight, or truly not delight? I observe what the world delights in—those who flock together in pursuit—rushing headlong as if they cannot stop, all calling it delight. Yet I find no delight in it, nor do I find it not delight. Is there truly delight, or is there not?

I regard non-action as true delight, yet it is what the common world deems most bitter. Therefore it is said: *"The utmost delight is without delight; the utmost praise is without praise."*

"誙誙" is also written as "胫胫."

The common world takes sensory pleasures—sights and sounds—as the highest delight, yet Master Zhuang embodies the Dao and forgets blandness, thus perceiving neither delight nor its absence.

The delight of non-action is simply freedom from care. Those who take sensory pleasures as delight do not know whether such delight is truly certain. If we follow Master Zhuang’s words, emptiness, blandness, and non-action are the truest delight. The world deems clamor and ostentation as delight, fine words and flattery as praise. Thus, the utmost delight lies in having no delight, and the utmost praise lies in having no praise.

Heaven achieves clarity through non-action; Earth achieves tranquility through non-action. Thus, when the two non-actions unite, the myriad things transform. Vague and indistinct, with no origin to trace! Indistinct and vague, with no form to perceive! The teeming things, each in its place, all grow from non-action. Therefore it is said: *"Heaven and Earth act not, yet nothing is left undone."* Who among men can attain non-action?

I practice non-action and let the world’s right and wrong take their own course—thus right and wrong are settled. Clinging to action and fixating on right or wrong, right and wrong remain unsettled. Through non-action and emptiness, forgetting right and wrong, right and wrong are resolved.

When the people are content, my person nears preservation. The utmost delight—delight without delight—constantly brings ease without care, nurturing body and mind to fulfill one’s allotted span. Only non-action comes near to this.

Let me attempt to speak of it. Heaven is clear through non-action; Earth is tranquil through non-action. When the two non-actions merge, the myriad things transform. Vague and indistinct, with no origin to trace! Indistinct and vague, with no form to perceive! The teeming things, each in its place, all grow from non-action. Thus it is said: *"Heaven and Earth act not, yet nothing is left undone."* Who among men can attain non-action?

The myriad things flourish in abundance—such is their appearance. Now, in spring they are born, in summer they grow; the multitude of beings thrives in profusion. Who causes this to be so? All arise of themselves. Tracing their source and flow, they spring from the seed of non-action. Since they are sown by non-action, how could they be the work of action?

**Exegesis:**
*"The myriad things flourish in abundance"*—Sima Biao says: "flourishing abundantly," like the sound of *zhuzhu*. Li Yi says: "the appearance of proliferation." According to the *Erya*, *zhi* means "to preside"; each has its own presiding principle and is distinct.

**Note by Lu Wenchang:** The character 殖 was formerly miswritten as 淔; now corrected.

**Commentary [8]:**
If there were action, there would be things left undone.

**Commentary [9]:**
Attaining non-action, one finds joy in the absence of joy—joy arrives of itself.

**Exegesis:**
*Shu* means "who." Heaven and Earth are clear and tranquil, ascending and descending in non-action and emptiness, yet in their generation and transformation, nothing is left undone. The common people, their minds dull and benighted, cling to desires—who among them can attain this non-action? To speak of those who can is to speak of the utmost endeavor. Those who attain it find their power in harmony with the Two Modes, their darkness merging with the supreme joy.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition omits the character *zhe* (者).
(2) The Zhao edition has *zu* (足) written as *ding* (定).
(3) The Shidetang edition has *zhi* (殖).
(4) The Shidetang edition has *ji* (濟) written as *qi* (齊).

When Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi went to offer his condolences. Zhuangzi, however, was squatting with legs splayed like a winnowing basket, drumming on a clay pot and singing.

**Commentary [1]:**
Zhuangzi and Huizi shared a friendship of pure and simple waters. Since death had come, it was only proper to go and offer condolences.

**Commentary [2]:**
"Squatting with legs splayed" means letting the legs hang down in the shape of a winnowing basket. The *pen* (盆) is a clay pot. Zhuangzi understood that life and death are not two, and that sorrow and joy are one. Thus, when his wife died, he did not weep but drummed on a pot and sang, his legs splayed in squatting posture, carefree and content.

**Explication of Terms:**
*Ji ju* (箕踞): pronounced *ju*.
*Pen* (盆): refers to a clay pot.

Huizi said, "You lived with her, raised children together, and grew old with her. That you do not weep at her death is already excessive—yet you drum on a pot and sing. Is this not going too far?"

**Commentary [1]:**
You shared a home with your wife, raised children together, and aged side by side. That you do not grieve at her death is already a violation of human principles, showing a lack of feeling. To add drumming and singing—how can this be so extreme?

**Explication of Terms:**
*Zhang zi* (長子): pronounced *ding zhang* (丁丈) in the reverse tone.

Zhuangzi said, "Not so. When she first died, how could I alone not have felt a pang of sorrow? Yet I examined her beginning and saw that originally there was no life. Not only was there no life, but originally there was no form. Not only was there no form, but originally there was no *qi*. Amidst the indistinct and nebulous, there was transformation, and *qi* arose. The *qi* transformed and form arose. The form transformed and life arose. Now, it has transformed again into death. This is like the progression of the four seasons: spring, autumn, winter, and summer. She now lies at peace in the great chamber, and if I were to wail and weep after her, I would consider myself as not understanding fate. Thus, I stopped."

---

As for "然," it means "thus." The world delights in life and abhors death, mourning the dead and rejoicing in life. Therefore, when I first heard of her death, how could I alone not have felt a pang of astonishment and sorrow!

**Explanation of "无概":** *Gudai* (古代) reversed.
Sima Biao says: "It means to feel."
Another reading: *gu* (骨), the appearance of grief and disorder.

Zhuangzi, as a sage, profoundly understood the root of things. Thus, he observed that originally there was no life at the beginning, and before there was life, there was also no form. Before there was form, there was also no *qi*. From nothing came something, temporarily conjoined to form. Knowing this, he saw that this body was not worth grieving over.

The great Dao resides within the indistinct and nebulous, amidst the obscure workings of creation. There, the clear and turbid intermingle, transforming into the *qi* of yin and yang. The *qi* congeals and transforms into form. Once form is established, it transforms into life. From nothing emerges something, transforming into life; from something returns nothing, transforming into death. Life comes and death goes, cycling in transformation, just like the progression of the four seasons: spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Thus, the enlightened observe this and find no cause for sorrow or joy!

**Commentary:** One who has not yet understood grieves, while one who has already grasped the truth ceases. This is how the sentient are instructed, guiding them to extend this principle to dispel their burdens.

**Explanation:** *Yanran* (偃然) describes the appearance of peaceful rest. *Jushi* (巨室) refers to the space between heaven and earth. If I am to rest in death, lying between heaven and earth, like the passing of heat and cold, how could I follow with lamentation and sorrow? Recognizing that I do not comprehend the mandate of heaven, I ceased my wailing and played the pot.

**Explanation of "巨室":** *Ju* (巨) means "great."
Sima Biao says: "It means taking heaven and earth as a chamber."
**Explanation of "噭噭":** *Gudiao* (古吊) reversed, or *guyao* (古尧) reversed.
**Explanation of "将令":** *Licheng* (力呈) reversed.

**Correction:** The missing text originally read "万物皆化," and now it says, "今又变而之死." The character "生" is present below "化," and another version has "有."

Zhili Shu and Gu Jie Shu were observing the mound of Ming Bo and the wasteland of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once rested.

Suddenly, a willow sprouted from Zhili Shu’s left elbow, and he was startled and displeased by it.

**Explanation:** *Zhili* (支离) means "disjointed limbs," signifying the forgetting of form. *Gu Jie* (滑介) is like *guji* (骨稽), meaning "prominent bones," signifying the forgetting of wisdom. To illustrate the degeneracy of the age, they are called "Shu" (叔). *Ming* (冥) means "dark," and *Bo* (伯) means "elder." *Kunlun* refers to the human body. It speaks of the profound obscurity of spirit and wisdom, sufficient to lead all things. Kunlun’s mystery is near, within the human body. Though the mound and wasteland are uneven, they are akin to the common world. Yet the Yellow Emperor, the sage ruler, illuminated the realm, resting his mind and ceasing his wisdom, dwelling among the ordinary. Thus, we know the profound subtlety of the supreme Dao is not distant. Therefore, these two "Shu" are invoked to illustrate this principle.

**Explanation of "支离叔与滑":** Pronounced *gu* (骨). Cui’s version has a missing character.
**Explanation of "介":** Pronounced *jie* (界).
**Explanation of "叔":** Li Yi says: "Zhili forgets form, Gu Jie forgets wisdom. These two masters understood transformation."
**Explanation of "冥伯之丘":** Li Yi says: "The name of a mound, signifying obscurity."
**Explanation of "昆仑":** *Limen* (力门) reversed.
**Explanation of "之虚":** Pronounced *xu* (墟).
**Explanation of "所休":** *Xiu* (休) means "to rest."

**Explanation:** *Juejue* (蹶蹶) describes the appearance of alarm. The willow (*liu* 柳) is a tree that grows easily; it symbolizes coffins and outer burial chambers, a sign of impending death. The two masters roamed Kunlun, observing transformation. In an instant, a willow sprouted from the left arm, startling Zhili Shu, who seemed displeased by it.

**Explanation of "左肘":** *Zhujiu* (竹九) reversed. Sima Biao’s version has *fu* (胕), pronounced *fu* (趺), meaning "the top of the foot."
◎ Jia Shifu says: The *Shuowen* defines *liu* (瘤) as "a swelling." The *Yupian* says: "A *liu* is a fleshy growth." The *Guangyun* says: "A *liu* is a fleshly protrusion." The *Shuowen* also describes *xi* (瘜) as "attached flesh." The *liu* that grows on the body is a borrowed form; human life is also a borrowed form. Both are attachments of dust and grime to things. The characters *liu* (柳) and *liu* (瘤) are phonetically related.
**Explanation of "蹶蹶":** *Jiwei* (纪卫) reversed, meaning "movement."
**Explanation of "恶之":** *Wulu* (乌路) reversed. The same applies hereafter.

Zhili Shu said, "Do you dislike it?"

**Explanation:** Observing transformation together, the value lies in emptiness and forgetting. To be startled and alarmed seems to express aversion.

Gu Jie Shu said, "No, why would I dislike it? Life is a borrowed form. What borrows and gives rise to life is but dust and grime. Life and death are like day and night. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has reached us. Why should I dislike it?"

**Explanation:** *Wang* (亡) means "none." The principle of observing transformation lies in forgetting all. I originally have no self, so what is there to dislike?

**Explanation:** The *qi* of yin and yang, the five phases, the four limbs, and the hundred parts of the body are temporarily conjoined and borrowed to form this body. Thus, we know that life is but an accumulation of dust and grime, not a true thing.

**Explanation of "垢也":** Pronounced *gou* (苟).

**Explanation:** Taking life as day and death as night, heaven cannot be without day and night, so how can humans be without life and death?

**Commentary:** This first demonstrates emotion, then guides one to seek the ultimate principle to dispel it. If one claims, "I am originally without emotion, thus I am without sorrow," then those with emotions would cut themselves off from the vast and boundless realm, lost in the struggle between sorrow and joy.

**Explanation:** You and I traveled together, observing transformation. Transformation has reached us, which is the natural course of awaiting our end. What is there to dislike?

Having merged with the transformations of life and death, one thus attains the ultimate joy.

When Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he came upon an empty skull, its form still stark and dry. Striking it with his horsewhip, he questioned it, saying: "Did you, sir, crave life and lose the Dao, thus coming to this? Or did you meet with the affairs of a fallen state, the execution of axe and halberd, thus coming to this? Or did you commit some unvirtuous deed, bringing shame upon your parents, wife, and children, thus coming to this? Or did you suffer the miseries of cold and hunger, thus coming to this? Or did your years naturally reach their end, thus coming to this?"

Zhuangzi journeyed to Chu and encountered a skull—hollow bones devoid of flesh, a withered frame without luster. He struck it with his horsewhip and questioned it, wishing to clarify the equal nature of life and death. Thus, he used the skull as a vessel for his allegorical inquiry.

Did you, sir, covet life and stray from principle, leading to an untimely death, leaving your bones thus? Or did you perish in the wars of a ruined state, executed by axe and halberd, leaving your remains thus? Or did you commit some wicked or thieving act, despised by the world and shamed before your kin, dying in disgrace thus? Or did you wander as a scholar far from home, your clothing and provisions exhausted, perishing from cold and hunger thus?

「Or did you, in the spring and autumn of your years—possessing the golden years of age and the venerable longevity of one advanced in virtue—reach the end of your Heaven-ordained mandate, thus coming to this?」

With these words, his inquiry concluded. He drew the skull near, using it as a pillow, and lay down to sleep. In the depths of night, the skull appeared to him in a dream, saying: *"Your discourse resembles that of a skilled debater. Yet all you have spoken of are the burdens of the living—none of these exist in death. Would you hear the account of death?"*

Zhuangzi replied: *"Indeed."*

The skull, granting Zhuangzi’s assent, proceeded to speak of death’s account: *"In death, there is no lord above, no subject below. Nor are there the affairs of the four seasons—only the unhurried vastness of heaven and earth as one’s spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it."*

Zhuangzi remained unconvinced and said: *"If I were to bid the Master of Fate restore your form—returning to you your bones, flesh, and skin, and bringing back your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances—would you desire this?"*

The skull furrowed its brow deeply in distress and replied: *"How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of mortal life!"*

When Yan Hui journeyed east to Qi, Confucius wore a troubled expression. Zigong rose from his mat and asked: *"This humble disciple ventures to ask—why does the Master appear troubled at Yan Hui’s journey to Qi?"*

Confucius replied: *"Your question is well asked! Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I hold in high regard: ‘A small sack cannot hold a great vessel; a short rope cannot draw from the deep.’ Such is the way of things—destiny has its completion, and form has its fitting place, neither to be diminished nor augmented. I fear that Yan Hui, in discoursing with the Lord of Qi on the ways of Yao, Shun, the Yellow Emperor, and further invoking the words of Suiren and Shennong, will lead him to seek within himself and find nothing. Finding nothing, he will be confounded; and a confounded man courts death."*

The annotations clarify: *Chu* means "to contain," and *huai* means "to envelop." *Geng* refers to the rope used for drawing water. A vessel of small capacity cannot hold a large object; a short rope cannot draw from a deep well. This saying comes from the writings of Guanzi, which Confucius admired, and thus he cited it as an analogy.

Have you alone not heard of this? Long ago, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu received it and offered it wine in the ancestral temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared the grandest sacrificial feast as its meal. The bird, however, grew dizzy and sorrowful, dared not eat a single morsel, nor drink a single cup, and died after three days. This was nourishing the bird as one would nourish oneself, not nourishing the bird as a bird ought to be nourished. To nourish a bird as a bird, one should let it roost in the deep forest, roam the open plains, float upon the rivers and lakes, feed at will, rest in formation, and dwell in ease. Why should it hear the clamor of human speech? When the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* is played across the wilds of Dongting, birds hear it and fly away, beasts hear it and flee, fish hear it and dive deep, while men, upon hearing it, gather to listen. Fish live in water and thrive, yet men drown in it—they must differ in nature, for their likes and dislikes are not the same.

Thus, the sages of old did not impose a single standard of ability nor demand uniformity in affairs. Names were confined to reality, and principles were established to suit the occasion—this is called "orderly coherence and sustained good fortune."

Xu Fu returned.

The *lao* and *shang* of *Shao* music are nourishment for men, not sustenance for birds—just as Yan Hui’s teachings would bring no joy to the Marquis of Qi.

The *tan* and *lu* are the lakes and islets; *ni* is mud; *tiao* is the spawn of whitefish. *Weiyi* describes ease and unhurried freedom. The proper way to nurture a bird is to let it roost in dense forests, roam the river isles, feed on fish spawn, float upon the rivers and lakes, fly in flocks, and wander at leisure—this is how one nurtures a bird by the bird’s own nature. It is like the Marquis of Qi, who followed his own ways, roamed freely, and found contentment in nothing beyond himself.

Why should there be clamor? *Xianchi* and the *Nine Shao* are music beloved by men. When played across the wilds of Dongting, fish and birds despise the sound: the one dives deep, the other soars high. Since there is both delight and aversion, what use are the eight tones?

Fish love water and hate land; men love land and hate water. Between men and fish, their natures differ, their likes and dislikes diverge—thus their life and death are not the same. Yet this is not true of these two alone; all things are so.

Each follows its own nature.

The sages of antiquity followed the nature of things, treating men as vessels—no single ability was imposed, no uniformity in affairs demanded. Each was suited to its nature, each matter to its occasion. Thus, to persuade the Marquis of Qi with the Way of the Three Sovereigns would be deeply misguided.

Names were confined to reality, and principles were established to suit the occasion—this is called "orderly coherence." When nature is constantly fulfilled, good fortune endures.

On the road, Liezi encountered a century-old skull amid the withered reeds. Plucking a stalk, he pointed to it and said:
"Only you and I know that you have never died, never lived. Are you truly grieved? Am I truly joyful?"

Liezi plucked a reed stalk and pointed to the skull, saying:
"Only you and I know that you have never died, never lived. Are you truly grieving? Am I truly joyful?"

**Annotations:**
Each finds joy in what it encounters.

**Commentary:**
*攓* means "to pluck." *从* means "beside." Liezi, weary from travel, ate by the roadside when he saw a withered, ancient skull, its appearance suggesting great age. "A century old" is a general estimate. The skull lay hidden beneath withered reeds, so he plucked the reeds aside and pointed to it, speaking thus. The skull regards life as death and death as life, while Liezi regards life as life and death as death. Each clings to one side of the matter, neither sufficient to settle the truth—hence, "never died, never lived."

**Philological Notes:**
*《道从》* read as written. Sima Biao says: *从* means "roadside." Some versions write *徒* instead.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Yin Jingshun’s *Liezi Tianrui* commentary reads *从* as *徒*, with Sima Biao glossing *徒* as "roadside." This differs from the present text.
◎ Qingfan observes: *道从* should be *道徒*, a scribal error—*从* and *徒* resemble each other, so *徒* was mistaken for *从*. The *Liezi Tianrui* chapter correctly reads *食于道徒*.
*《攓》* read *jǔ niǎn*, *xú yǎn*, or *qǐ qián*. Sima Biao says: "to pluck." Some read *jué*.
*《蓬》* read *bù dōng* or *fú gōng*.
◎ Qingfan notes: The proper character for *攓* is *□*. The *Shuowen* defines *□* as "to pluck." *攓* is a loan for *□*, hence Sima’s gloss "to pluck." It is also written as *搴*. The *Li Sao* reads: "At dawn I plucked the magnolia from the hillside." (The *Shuowen* cites this with the proper character *□*.) The *Erya* says: *芼* means *搴*. Fan Guang comments: *搴* means "to pluck." The *Shiwen* reads *搴* as *jiǔ niǎn*. The *Hanshu* *Ji Bu zhuan* reads: "He plucked the banner several times," with Li Qi glossing *搴* as "to pluck."

**Annotations:**
The reality of joy and sustenance has no fixed abode.

**Commentary:**
"Are you content in the dark, truly nourished by obscurity? Am I delighted by human affairs—can human joys be certain?" Each finds contentment in what it encounters, but nothing can be definitively settled.

**Philological Notes:**
*《若果》* Some versions read *汝果*; the *Yuanjia* edition reads *汝过*.
*《养》* Sima Biao’s version reads *暮*, glossed as "death."
*《予果》* The *Yuanjia* edition reads *子过*.
*《欢乎》* Sima Biao’s version reads *嚾*, glossed as "a cry of life," meaning birth.
◎ Yu Yue says: *养* should be read as *恙* ("worry"). The *Erya* *Shi Gu* defines *恙* as "worry." "Are you truly worried? Am I truly joyful?" *恙* and *欢* form a pair, as do "worry" and "joy." This means that your death is not sorrow, nor is my life joy. *恙* and *养* are interchangeable in ancient script. The *Book of Songs* *Er Zi Cheng Zhou* reads: "My heart is full of *养养*," with the commentary glossing *养* as "worry," following the *Erya*. Sima Biao’s version mistakenly writes *养* as *暮*.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition reads *若* as *汝*.

How many kinds of beings are there?
When it obtains water, it becomes *jì*. When it obtains the border of water and earth, it becomes the raiment of *pín*. When it arises on a mound, it becomes *língxì*. When *língxì* obtains *yùqī*, it becomes *wūzú*. The root of *wūzú* is *qícáo*, and its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in time, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off skin, and their name is *qúdūo*. After a thousand days, *qúdūo* becomes a bird called *gānyúgǔ*. The foam of *gānyúgǔ* becomes *sīmí*, and *sīmí* becomes *shíxī*. *Yílù* arises from *shíxī*, and *huánghuáng* from *jiǔyóu*. *Màoruì* arises from *fǔquán*. *Yángxī* and the long-bamboo that does not sprout together give birth to *qīngníng*; *qīngníng* gives birth to *chéng*, *chéng* gives birth to horses, and horses give birth to humans. Humans, in turn, return to the *mechanism*. All things emerge from the *mechanism* and all return to the *mechanism*.

**Annotations:**
The varieties of transformation are beyond counting.

**Commentary:**
Yin and Yang create things, their transformations endless. To enumerate their kinds would be impossible.

**Philological Notes:**
*《种》* read *zhǒng*. The annotation reads the same.

The *Yǒujǐ* is pronounced *jūqǐ*. The *kěshèng* is read as *shēng*.

The generative *qi* moistens and engenders things, proceeding from non-being to being, thus perpetuating one another in succession.

When it encounters water, it becomes *jì*. This is an ancient character for "severed." Xú reads it as *jué*, while modern pronunciation follows *jì*. Sīmǎ’s version reads *jì*, stating: "Though the omens of the myriad things exist, they only arise in succession upon receiving the *qi* of water and earth." Some versions write it as *duàn* ("cut off") or *xùduàn* ("continuously severed").

Lú Wénchāng notes: The ancient character for "severed" should be written as such; this *jì* (without the silk radical) is in fact the character *jì* ("to continue").
Jiā Shìfù observes: The *Shìwén* cites Sīmǎ’s version as *jì*, stating that though the omens of the myriad things exist, they only arise in succession upon receiving water and earth. Some versions write it as *duàn* or *xùduàn*. It is likely that *xùduàn* is correct. The *Shuōwén* defines *xù* as *shuǐxì* (water plantain). The *Ěryǎ* glosses *xù* as *niúchún* ("ox lips"), and Guō’s commentary cites the *Máo Shī Zhuàn*: "a water plant like *xù*, severed inch by inch with nodes." *Xù* is the character *xù* ("to continue"), identical to the *xùduàn* of the *Běncǎo*.

When it encounters the boundary of water and earth, it becomes *pín zhī yī* (mossy garment). This is green moss, which in water resembles spread silk; commonly called "toad’s garment."

Sīmǎ states: "The roots of things lie at the boundary of water and earth, spreading in the water. Though invisible when viewed from above the water, they may be felt when pressed, like silk spread in water. The people of Chǔ call this *pín zhī yī*."

When it arises on mounds and hills, it becomes *língxì* (hill plantain). *Tún* means "mound" or "hill." *Língxì* is plantain grass. Once it grows on elevated land, it transforms into plantain.

Sīmǎ reads *tún* as *túmén*, while Guō reads it as *chún*. Sīmǎ states: "Things formed by water and born on land arise on mounds and hills, transforming into plantain, hence renamed *língxì*. It is also called *zéxì* (marsh plantain), changing with moisture and dryness. Yet their origins are unknown, for the transformations of things have no fixed form. When humans die, they may transform into grasses or trees, and the essence of grasses or trees may become humans."

When *língxì* encounters *yùqī* (decaying matter), it becomes *wūzú* (crow’s foot). *Yùqī* is compost or soil. When *língxì* ages, it transforms into compost.

The compost then generates the roots of *wūzú* grass.

Sīmǎ states: "*Yùqī* is the name of an insect; *wūzú* is the name of a grass that grows by water. When *yùqī* resides within *língxì*, it transforms into *wūzú*." Lǐ comments: "*Yùqī* is compost. *Língxì* in compost transforms into *wūzú*."

Jiā Shìfù notes: The *Ěryǎ* defines *fúwèi* and *mǎxì* as plantain, with Guō’s commentary stating: "Today’s plantain grass, called 'toad’s garment' in the Jiangdong region." The *Ěryǎ* also defines *yúxì*, with Guō’s commentary: "Today’s *zéxù*, also called *shuǐxì*, *mǎxì*, or *zéxì*—three names for the same type, though their habitats differ." Lù Jī’s *Shī Shū* states: "*Xù* (*zéxì*) has leaves like plantain." The *Tú Jīng* also states that *zéxì* grows in shallow water. Thus, *língxì* growing on mounds must be a distinct thing. The *Shìwén* cites Sīmǎ: "Things formed by water and born on land arise on mounds, transforming into plantain, hence renamed *língxì*." Plantain grows by roadsides and does not arise on mounds.

The roots of *wūzú* become *qícáo* (grubs). *Xū* is the name of a butterfly. With no fixed form in transformation, its roots become grubs while its leaves become butterflies.

Sīmǎ’s version writes it as *cáoqí*, stating: "This is a scorpion." Luò Qìngfān notes: The *Tàipíng Yùlǎn* (948) cites Sīmǎ: "*Wūzú* is the name of a grass growing by water. *Cáoqí* is an insect." This differs from the *Shìwén*.

Sīmǎ states: "*Húdié* is *jiádié* (brush-footed butterfly). Grass transforms into insects, and insects into grass, without end."

Yú Yuè notes: The *Shìwén* states, "*Húdié xū yě*, also called *xū*." This obscures the meaning; it should be read with the following sentence: "The *húdié xū yě* transforms into an insect," paralleling the later text, "*qūduō* after a thousand days becomes a bird." A thousand days signifies a long duration, while "*xū yě* transforms into an insect" signifies speed. The *Lièzǐ Tiānruì Piān Shìwén* states: "*Xū* means 'little,' referring to a short time." This captures the meaning.

Jiā Shìfù notes: The *Shìwén* cites Sīmǎ: "*Húdié* is also called *xū*." I suspect *xū* is not the name of a butterfly. The *Ěryǎ* defines *è* as *niǎoxiē* (bird scorpion), with Guō’s commentary: "A large insect like a finger, resembling a silkworm." The *Máo Shī Zhuàn* defines *zhú* as *sāngchóng* (mulberry insect). The *Shuōwén* defines *zhú* as "the silkworm in *shǔkuí* (hollyhock)." The *Guǎng Zhì* states: "*Huòzhú* comes in five colors; *huáizhú* has patterns and horns." The *Ěryǎ* mentions *sāngjiǎn*, *chūjiǎn*, *làijiǎn*, *luánjiǎn*, and *xiāojiǎn*, all types of *zhú*. When old, they become pupae and then butterflies. Butterfly eggs, warmed by fire, become *zhú* again. Those born under stoves seek warmth. The *Píyǎ* states: "Cocoons become moths, and moths lay eggs." Guō’s commentary on the *Ěryǎ* defines *luóluó* as silkworm moths, noting they emerge from silkworm pupae. This is correct.

The butterfly and the silkworm-*zhú* class mutually transform. The phrase "xū yě" refers to this mutual transformation. The *Bóyǎ* states: "The wild silkworm’s pupa becomes *qú*." Here, *qú* is a loan character for *qú*. [Eight] [Commentary] *Qúdūo* is the name of an insect. When it receives warm *qi*, it becomes this creature, appearing as if newly shed of its skin, its form and appearance refined and pure. [Exegesis] For *"transforming into an insect born beneath the stove"*, Sīmǎ explains: "It arises from receiving warm *qi*." For *"its form like shedding"*, *tuō* is read as *tuò*. Sīmǎ glosses *yuè* as "the freshness and beauty of newly emerged skin." ◎ Qìngfān’s note in the *Jíyùn* (Section Seventeen, *xuē*) cites Sīmǎ: "The insect’s newly emerged skin has a fresh and beautiful appearance," slightly differing from the *Exegesis*. For *"its name is qú"*, *qú* is read as *qú*. For *"duō"*, *duō* is read as *duó*. [Nine] [Commentary] *Gānyúgǔ* is the bird whose saliva transforms into the *sīmí* insect. [Exegesis] For *"qúdūo after a thousand days becomes a bird called gānyúgǔ"*, *gān* is read as *gān*. For *"the saliva of gānyúgǔ"*, *mò* is read as *mò*. Lǐ explains: "The juice from its mouth." For *"becomes sīmí"*, Lǐ explains: "An insect." [Ten] [Commentary] The midges in vinegar jars likewise become *xiējī*. [Exegesis] For *"sīmí becomes food"*, read as written. Sīmǎ’s version has *shí* (to consume). For *"xiē"*, *xī* is read as *xī*, and Lǐ reads it as *hǎi*. Sīmǎ explains: "*Shíxiē* resembles the midges on wine." *Miè* is read as *miánjié*, and *měng* as *wúkǒng*. ◎ Jiā Shìfù states: The *Lièzǐ*’s *Tiānruì* chapter says, *"Sīmí becomes food-xiē; yílù arises from food-xiē; huángkuàng arises from jiǔyóu; jiǔyóu arises from màoruì; màoruì arises from fǔquán."* Thus, *yílù*, *huángkuàng*, and the others are all types of *food-xiē*. The *Fāngyán* states: "*Cǐcáo* east of Mǐn is called *qiúcǐ*; in the region of Liáng and Yì, it is called *qū*." *Lù* should be *qū*; *yóu* should be *yóu* (a kind of beetle).

The *Hanshu*’s "Biography of Wang Bao" states: *"Fúyóu emerge from yin."* All are swarming small insects. Guo’s commentary on the *Erya*’s *mièměng* says: "A tiny insect resembling the *ruì*, fond of chaotic flight." *Màoruì* should be written as [ ]. The *Xunzi* says: *"Xiē* turns sour and gathers there," also a type of *food-xiē*. This metaphorically speaks of small insects transforming among themselves.

◎ **Annotation [11]** *Huángkuàng* is also an insect name.
**Exegesis** *Yí* is read as *yǐzhī*. For *"lù arises from food-xiē"*, *lù* is read as *lù*, with an alternate reading of *luò*. For *huángkuàng*, read as *kuàng*; Xú and Lǐ read it as *xiūwǎng*. Sīmǎ states: "*Yílù* and *huángkuàng* are both insect names." For *"arises from jiǔyóu"*, read as *yóu*. Lǐ comments: "*Jiǔ* should be *jiǔ* (long-lasting); *jiǔ* means old. *Yóu* is an insect name."

◎ Lú Wénchāo notes: According to the *Lièzǐ*, it reads: *"Sīmí becomes food-xiē; yílù arises from food-xiē; huángkuàng arises from jiǔyóu; jiǔyóu arises from màoruì."*

◎ **Annotation [12]** *Màoruì* is an insect name. *Fǔquán* is the firefly, also said to be the *fěnsǔ* insect.
**Exegesis** *Mào* is read as *mòdòu*, with alternate readings of *mòzhù* and *wángjiǎo*. *Ruì* is read as *rúruì*, with Xú reading it as *rúyuè*. For *"arises from fǔ"*, read as *fǔ*. *Quán* is read as *quán*; Guō reads it as *huān*. Sīmǎ states: "It is also an insect name." The *Erya* says: "It is also called *shǒuzhǎo*; another name is *fénshǔ*."

◎ **Annotation [13]** Both are plant names.
**Exegesis** *Yángxī bǐ* is read as *pízhì*. For *"bù (upper: sǔn; lower: zǐ)"*, read as *xīyǐn*. Sīmǎ states: "*Yángxī* is a plant name; its root resembles the turnip. It combines with *jiǔzhú* to form a thing, all arising from non-like kinds."

◎ **Annotation [14]** *Yángxī* combines with *jiǔzhú* to produce the *qīngníng* insect.
**Exegesis** For *"jiǔzhú produces qīngníng"*, Sīmǎ states: "It is an insect name."

◎ Lú Wénchāo notes: Yīn Jìngshùn says the *Zhuāngzǐ* connects *yángxī* to *qīngníng* as a single phrase. Sīmǎ’s explanation is indeed thus, but Guō’s edition separates them. The *Lièzǐ* writes *bù* as *sǔn*.

◎ **Annotation [15]** It is also an insect name.
**Exegesis** For *"qīngníng produces chéng"*, Lǐ comments: "Unheard of."

◎ **Annotation [16]** The source is unclear.
**Exegesis** For *"chéng produces horses; horses produce humans"*, the common edition contains many errors, hence it is recorded in full.

◎ **Commentary** This speaks of one *qi* and myriad forms, of transformations without death or birth.
**Exegesis** *Jī* means activation, referring to creation and transformation. Creation and transformation are no-thing. Humans arise from nothing into being, then return to nothing. Not only humans—all things are thus. Some transform from non-sentience to sentience, [some] from sentience to non-sentience, some from non-sentience to non-sentience, some from sentience to sentience, in ten thousand transformations without end. This ebb and flow of change is called life and death. Knowing transformations are boundless, how could one delight in life or loathe death? Embracing this purport is called utmost joy.

◎ Yú Yuē states: "*Jiǔ* should be *jiǔ* (long-lasting), a scribal error. *Jiǔ* means old. The preceding text, *huángkuàng arises from jiǔyóu*, in the exegesis cites Lǐ’s note: '*Jiǔ* should be *jiǔ*; *jiǔ* means old.' This is its meaning."

"When humans grow old, they return to the mechanism," speaks of humans aging and reverting to the mechanism. The *Tian Rui* chapter of the *Liezi* precisely reads: "Humans long-lasting enter the mechanism."

**Outer Chapters: "Attaining Life" Nineteenth | "Mountain Trees" Twentieth**
**Outer Chapters: "Attaining Life" Nineteenth**【1】
【1】【*Shiwen*】Named by its purport.

Those who grasp the essence of life do not strive for what life cannot employ; those who grasp the essence of destiny do not strive for what knowledge cannot alter. Nurturing form must first rely on things, yet there are cases where things are in excess while form remains unnourished. Having life must first mean not departing from form, yet there are cases where form does not depart while life perishes. Life’s coming cannot be refused, nor its going halted. Alas! The people of the world believe that nurturing form suffices to preserve life; yet if nurturing form indeed does not suffice to preserve life, then what in the world is worth doing? Though it may not suffice, what cannot be left undone cannot be avoided.

【1】【Annotation】What life cannot employ refers to things beyond one’s lot.
【*Shiwen*】*Da sheng*: *Da* means unimpeded, thorough. *Guang Ya* states: *Sheng* means emergence.

【2】【Annotation】What knowledge cannot alter refers to matters beyond destiny.
【Exegesis】All humans are born with their allotted portions—whether form is fair or plain, life long or short, and whether one is poor or rich, noble or base, foolish or wise, successful or frustrated—every detail is ordained by destiny. Thus, those who thoroughly grasp the nature of life and destiny, with luminous insight, never covet what lies beyond their lot nor burden themselves with extraneous affairs. Whatever is allotted by destiny is beyond the reach of knowledge or contrivance.

【3】【Annotation】Knowing one’s limits, matching things to life—life is thus fulfilled; excess harms.
【Exegesis】*Things* refer to resources, clothing, and food—daily necessities. Nurturing the body must first employ things, yet things have their limits and must not be boundless. Thus, there are vulgar men who accumulate excess yet fail to nourish their bodies.

【*Shiwen*】*Wu chen*: Pronounced *chǐ zhèng*.

【4】【Annotation】Clinging to form too greatly causes life to perish.
【Exegesis】Having this transient life yet failing to depart from form and abandon cunning, loving form excessively, one loses the Way of preserving life. Such cases exist in the world.

【*Shiwen*】*Wu li*: Pronounced *lì zhì*. *Tai shen*: Pronounced *tài*.

【5】【Annotation】What is not within my control should not occupy one’s thoughts.
【Exegesis】Life and death, coming and going, are entrusted to creation. Those who profoundly grasp this origin harbor no aversion.

【6】【Annotation】Thus, the more one nurtures, the more one loses.
【Exegesis】Longevity and early death, departure and arrival, are not within one’s control. Yet the people of the world, failing to comprehend this principle, covet abundant resources and lavishly nurture their bodies, mistakenly believing it suffices to preserve life—how lamentable!

【7】【Annotation】The more lavishly one nurtures, the sooner death arrives.
【Exegesis】Excessive nurturing of form hastens death, thus it is definitively insufficient to preserve life.

【8】【Annotation】Better to let go and follow it.
【Exegesis】Chasing after external things is originally for the sake of life. Since life is not preserved by nurturing, one realizes that worldly affairs are not worth pursuing!

【9】【Annotation】What each nature is allotted arises from the utmost principle, thus cannot be avoided. Therefore, those who skillfully nurture life follow and accord with it.
【Exegesis】Extraneous affairs are not worth pursuing; essential affairs cannot be left undone. Seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, walking with the feet, knowing with the mind—these are endowed by nature and principle. Though they may seem effortless, they cannot be shunned.

【Collation】
(1) *Hongming Ji*’s *Zheng Wu Lun* cites *zhi* as *ming*.
(2) *Shi De Tang* edition omits *yi*.
(3) *Tai* is amended according to *Shiwen* and the *Shi De Tang* edition.

To avoid being enslaved by form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Abandoning the world means freedom from entanglements; freedom from entanglements means upright equilibrium; upright equilibrium means alternating renewal; alternating renewal means nearing completion. What affairs are worth abandoning, and what life is worth forsaking? Abandoning affairs spares the body from toil; forsaking life preserves essence from depletion. When form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things; union forms their bodies, dispersion forms their beginnings. When form and essence are not depleted, this is called *transformation*; essence refined further refines, returning to assist Heaven.

【1】【Annotation】*Alternating renewal* means daily renewal. Entrusting oneself to daily renewal exhausts one’s nature and destiny.
【Exegesis】*Ji* means completion. *Alternating renewal* means daily renewal. To nurture form through action, nothing surpasses abandoning extraneous worldly affairs.

Abandoning the world eliminates care and entanglement; freed from care and entanglement, one aligns with the upright, true, and impartial Dao. Impartiality merges with the ceaseless transformations of daily renewal, thus exhausting the profound mysteries of the Dao.

【*Shiwen*】*Zeji*: Xu reads *qi* as *yi* in reverse.

【2】【Annotation】The reason for forsaking them.

【Exegesis】The world of men is hollow and insubstantial—what is there worth abandoning? The course of life is but empty illusion—what is there worth forsaking? Thus, abandoning worldly affairs spares the body from toil, and forsaking the course of life preserves the spirit from depletion.

【3】【Annotation】Neither is pursued.

【Exegesis】When form remains whole and undisturbed, one preserves the mandate of Heaven in its completeness; when essence is firm and undepleted, one returns to the original source. With form and spirit both intact, one becomes one with the virtue of the mysterious Heaven.

【4】【Annotation】Without partiality, thus able to nurture the myriad things.

【Exegesis】The Two Modes act without intent yet give rise to the transformations of the myriad things. Therefore, those who unite their virtue with Heaven and Earth become the parents of all living beings.

【5】【Annotation】Wherever they are, they take form; no fixed abode.

【Exegesis】When yin and yang intermingle, they form bodily substance; when breath scatters and disperses, it returns to the unborn beginning.
◎*Jia Shifu* says: Union is the mechanism of growth, the gradual onset of decay. Dispersion returns to the root, and the mechanism of growth once more comes to rest therein—thus it is called "forming the beginning." Ending gives rise to beginning: such is the movement of Heaven. This is how *transformation* occurs—not by clinging to constancy, but by fulfilling the Great Constancy.

【*Shiwen*】*Changchu*: Read *chang* as *changlü* in reverse.

【6】【Annotation】Moving in tandem with transformation.

【Exegesis】*Transformation* means to shift and turn. When the body is not wearied and essence remains undepleted, one can follow change and move with things in their ceaseless flux.

【7】【Annotation】Returning to assist its spontaneity.

【Exegesis】*Xiang* means to aid. To refine further and further is to refine essence again and again, thus returning to the root and aiding the Dao of spontaneity.

【*Shiwen*】*Xiangtian*: Read *xiang* as *xiliang* in reverse.

Zi Liezi asked Guan Yin: "The perfected person walks without obstruction, treads fire without burning, and moves above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?"

【1】【Annotation】With a vacant mind, one can master the manifold realities.
【Exegesis】The ancients addressed their teachers as *zi*, a term of esteem for those of virtue. Both senses apply here, hence *Zi Liezi*—Lie Yukou. *Guan Yin*: surnamed Yin, named Xi, styled Gongdu, served as magistrate of Hangu Pass, thus *Guanling Yin the Perfected*; a disciple of Laozi, he embraced the Dao and upheld virtue, so Liezi sought his counsel. *Zhi* means obstruction. The utmost sage, veiling brilliance and concealing radiance, moves through the world in hidden obscurity, blending with the dust without hindrance from external things. Thus, like an empty chamber, he remains unobstructed. Some versions read "empty" in place of "unobstructed."
【*Shiwen*】*Guan Yin*: Li [Yun] says: Magistrate Yin of the Pass. *Bu zhi*: Pronounced *zhenxi* in reverse.

【2】【Annotation】In perfect accord, nothing is impossible—not because things come to be permitted, but because nothing is impermissible.
【Exegesis】Indifferent to heat and cold, fire cannot harm him; undisturbed by high or low, his heart knows no fear.
【*Shiwen*】*Dao huo*: Pronounced *tubao* in reverse.

【3】【Exegesis】This summarizes the preceding question.

Guan Yin replied: "This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or reckless daring.
Stay, and I shall tell you!
All that bears form, image, sound, or color is but *thing*—how can things differ from one another? Why should any precede another? They are but *color* alone.
Thus, things arise from the formless and cease where transformation ends. He who attains this and exhausts its depths—how can things ever confine him?
He abides within the measure of restraint, conceals himself in the boundless principle, roams the beginning and end of the myriad things, unifies his nature, nurtures his qi, harmonizes his virtue, and thereby communes with the source of all things.
One who is thus—his celestial endowment remains whole, his spirit knows no fissure—how could things ever intrude?"

【1】【Exegesis】He who remains unharmed by external things does so by safeguarding the qi of perfect harmony, nurturing a mind of tranquility, not through the exertion of intellect, the discrimination of cunning, or the resolve of reckless daring.
【*Shiwen*】*Fei zhi*: Pronounced *yin zhi*. *Zhi lie*: Pronounced *yin li*.

The base text may also read *li*. 【2】【Exegesis】When the Lord commanded Yu-kou to sit again, I told you the ultimate words. 【*Shiwen*】*Yu yu*: Pronounced *yu ju*. *Nu*: Pronounced *ru*. The same applies hereafter. 【3】【Commentary】Only the mindless alone remain distant. 【*Shiwen*】*Xiang yuan*: Pronounced *yu wan*. 【4】【Commentary】They are but forms and colors—how could one precede the other? 【Exegesis】Forms, appearances, sounds, and colors—all that can be seen or heard—are mere things. If both are things, how could one be distant or precede the other? For both are but sounds and colors. Only one who is neither sound nor color, who transcends sight and hearing, can rise beyond appearances and stand before all things. 【5】【Commentary】Ever roaming the ultimate. 【Exegesis】One who is neither form nor color can thus create form and color; one who is without change or transformation can thus transform and change the myriad things. Therefore, all beings receive their forms from creation and rest in the wondrous root of transformation. 【6】【Commentary】The ultimate is not constrained by things. 【Exegesis】One who grasps the deep root of creation and the wondrous root of spontaneity, who exhausts principle and fulfills nature—how could the myriad things of the world ever restrain or control him? Thus, he comes and goes alone, appears and vanishes freely, rides the upright and wields discernment—what does he await? 【*Shiwen*】*Yan de*: Pronounced *yu qian*. 【7】【Commentary】Abiding within the bounds of what is received. 【Exegesis】The sage who attains the Dao dwells in a mind of emptiness and tranquility, his measure vast and boundless, never stagnating in the world. 【8】【Commentary】Obscurely harmonizing with ceaseless transformation. 【Exegesis】The great Dao has no beginning or end, neither start nor finish. It employs this primordial chaos as its guiding principle, so the sage conceals his mind and obscures his traces in the realm of the indistinct. 【9】【Commentary】Beginning and end are the ultimate of things. 【Exegesis】The beginning and end of things refer to creation. Life and death, beginning and end, are all creation—things inherently regard beginning and end as creation. Yet the sage wanders freely in the realm of spontaneity, roaming the field of creation. 【10】【Commentary】Adornment divides. 【Exegesis】Moving in accord with nature, he remains undivided. 【11】【Commentary】Not employing the mind to direct it. 【Exegesis】Exhaling and inhaling in emptiness and serenity, he thus nurtures his primal qi. 【12】【Commentary】Not allowing things to separate from nature. 【Exegesis】Embracing the One without departure, he thus constantly merges with mysterious virtue. 【13】【Commentary】All things arise from self-so. 【Exegesis】The source of things is spontaneity. Having unified his nature and harmonized his virtue, he responds to things, thus penetrating the origin of the ultimate Dao and communing with the root of spontaneity. 【14】【Exegesis】*Is* refers to the aforementioned sage. *Zi* means "from." One who is thus safeguards the Dao of spontaneity, keeping it whole and unharmed; his spirit is concentrated and luminous, without the slightest fissure. How could worldly things ever enter his sacred precinct? 【*Shiwen*】*Wu xi*: Pronounced *qu ni*. 【Collation】(1) The missing character in the Jiangnan ancient manuscript is *xing* above *se*. (2) The missing character in Zhang Junfang’s edition reads *zheng* instead of *zhi*.

When a drunken man falls from a carriage, though injured, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling; life and death, terror and fear do not enter his breast. Thus, he encounters things without dread. 【1】If one who is preserved by wine is thus, 【2】how much more so one preserved by Heaven? 【3】The sage is concealed in Heaven, so nothing can harm him. 【4】

One seeking vengeance does not break the Mo-ye sword; 【5】even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a flying tile. 【6】Thus, the world is balanced. 【7】There are no wars or strife, no punishments of slaughter—all arises from this Dao. 【8】【1】【Exegesis】From here onward, three analogies illustrate the sage’s spontaneity and mindlessness. The first is the drunken man, the second the sharp sword, and the third the flying tile—this is the first. When a drunken man rides in a carriage and suddenly falls, though injured, he surely does not die. This is because his mind is free of entanglements, his spirit whole and concentrated. Unaware of riding or falling, life and death do not enter him, so he encounters external things without fear or dread. 【*Shiwen*】*Zhi zhui*: The character may also be written as *dui*, pronounced *zhi lei*.

All subsequent instances follow the same pattern.

◎ Jia Shifu notes: One begins by guarding the qi and ends by nurturing the spirit—this is what Daoists call "refining qi to return to spirit."

《乘亦》 is pronounced *sheng*, or alternatively *shengzheng*.

《遌》 is pronounced *wu*; Guo reads it as *e*. The *Erya* states: *E*, meaning "to oppose." Guo’s annotation says: "to offend or clash."

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current text reads [as above].

《不慑》 is pronounced *zhi she*, meaning "fear."

Li and Guo read it as *xi*.

【2】【Annotation】 The drunkard merely loses what he knows—this is not the same as being naturally mindless.

【3】【Exegesis】 That drunken man, though impaired by wine, may still attain a moment of serene indifference and avoid harm from external things. How much more so for the sage whose virtue is complete and who is profoundly attuned to the Dao of spontaneity! Nothing can harm him, and thus it is fitting.

【4】【Annotation】 Not peering beyond the bounds of one’s nature—this is called "concealing."

【Exegesis】 The sage’s illumination equals the Three Luminaries, and his wisdom encompasses all things. Yet he conceals his brilliance and restrains his knowledge within the realm of spontaneity, so that nothing can harm him.

【5】【Annotation】 The Ganjiang and Moye swords, though wielded by enemies, are not broken by those who seek vengeance, for they are without mind.

【Exegesis】 This is the second analogy. Ganjiang and Moye are both ancient fine swords. Though they are used to kill and thus provoke enmity, those who seek vengeance never grow angry at the swords themselves and break them—precisely because they are without mind, and thus nothing can harm them.

【*Shiwen*】《镆》 is pronounced *mo*; it may also be written as 莫.
《干》 Li explains: Moye and Ganjiang are both names of ancient sharp swords. The *Annals of Wu and Yue* states: King Helü of Wu ordered Ganjiang to forge a sword, which took two forms—one called Ganjiang, the other Moye. Moye was the name of Ganjiang’s wife.

【6】【Annotation】 A flying tile, though it may strike someone, is not resented, for it is without emotion.

【Exegesis】 A flying tile that accidentally injures someone is never held in resentment, even by those with vengeful or narrow hearts, for the tile is an object without mind. This is the third analogy.

【*Shiwen*】《忮心》 is pronounced *zhi chi*; Guo and Li read it as *zhi*, meaning "harm." The character book defines it as "stubborn."
《飘瓦》 is pronounced *pi yao*; Guo and Li explain it as "falling."
《虽复》 is pronounced *fu you*; the same applies in the next chapter.
《中人》 is pronounced *zhong ren*.

【7】【Annotation】 All disharmony arises from emotion.

【8】【Annotation】 The Dao of no-emotion is vast indeed.

【Exegesis】 When the realm is at peace, distant lands are tranquil, the wilderness knows no war, and the court imposes no punishments of slaughter—all this arises from the Dao of non-action and the mindlessness of the sage. Thus, we know the greatness of the principle of mindlessness.

Do not open the Heaven of man but open the Heaven of Heaven. Opening the Heaven of Heaven gives rise to virtue; opening the Heaven of man gives rise to harm. Do not reject Heaven, nor neglect man—then the people will nearly attain their true nature!

【1】【Annotation】 Knowing without deliberation is opening the Heaven of Heaven; responding after knowing is opening the Heaven of man. Thus, opening the Heaven of Heaven is the movement of nature, while opening the Heaven of man is the function of knowledge.

【Exegesis】 Guo’s annotation states: Knowing without deliberation is opening the Heaven of Heaven; responding after knowing is opening the Heaven of man. Thus, opening the Heaven of Heaven is the movement of nature, and opening the Heaven of man is the function of knowledge. Guo has grasped the meaning—no further explanation is needed.

【2】【Annotation】 When nature moves, it meets things and is content with sufficiency, forgetting all else—thus virtue arises.

【3】【Annotation】 When knowledge is employed, it follows stimuli and seeks endlessly—thus harm arises.

【Exegesis】 To act in accord with nature and remain ever tranquil—thus virtue arises. To govern the world with knowledge brings the deepest harm—thus harm arises. As the *Laozi* says: "Governing a state with knowledge is the state’s thief; governing a state without knowledge is the state’s virtue."

【4】【Annotation】 Acting in accord with one’s Heavenly nature ensures that human principles are also preserved.

【Exegesis】 To constantly follow the nature of spontaneity is not to reject Heaven; to rely on knowledge to illuminate things is not to neglect man.

【*Shiwen*】《不厌》 Li reads it as *yu yan*; Xu reads it as *yu zhan*.

【5】【Annotation】 The afflictions of the people and the rise of artifice always lie in the function of knowledge, not in the movement of nature.

【Exegesis】 *Ji* means "to exhaust." Following Heaven and employing man, moving with nature and using knowledge—when human and Heavenly are undivided and the function of knowledge is no different, then all under heaven exhaust their true nature, and the people are without artifice.

【*Shiwen*】《几乎》 is pronounced *ji*, or alternatively *qi*.

Confucius traveled to Chu and passed through a forest, where he saw a hunchbacked man catching cicadas as if picking them up.

【1】【Exegesis】 *Goulou* describes the appearance of an old man with a bent back. *Cheng tiao* means "to catch cicadas." *Duo* means "to pick up." Confucius, on his mission to Chu, walked through the rustling forest and encountered an old man using a pole to catch cicadas—as if bending down to gather dust, without missing a single one.

【*Shiwen*】《痀》 Guo reads it as *yu yu*; Li and Xu read it as *ju ju*, or alternatively *qiu yu*.
《偻》 Guo reads it as *lü*; Li and Xu read it as *liang fu*.

「《承》」One version reads *mei*. ◎ Qing Fan’s note: *Cheng* is read as *zheng* (《說文》 writes it as □). *Zheng* means "to draw and take." In *Gen* hexagram, line six-two, "not rescuing what follows," Yu Fan says: *Zheng* means "to take." The *Shiwen* writes *zheng* as *cheng* (the Tongzhi Hall edition emends *cheng* to *zheng*) and glosses it as the *zheng* of "to rescue." In the *Huan* hexagram (emended from *Fu*), line six-one, "using a strong horse to rescue brings good fortune," the *Shiwen* notes: the *Zixia* edition writes *zheng* as □; □ means "to take." In the *Huangdi* chapter of the *Liezi*, "having disciples enter the current to draw him out," the *Shiwen* glosses *cheng* as *zheng*, citing the *Fangyan*: "to pull one out of drowning is called *cheng*" (modern *fangyan* writes it as *zheng*). In the *Zuozhuan*, twelfth year of Duke Xuan, "gazing into the dry well to rescue him," the *Shiwen* writes *zheng* as *cheng* and glosses it as *zheng*. All convey the meaning of "to draw and take." 《蜩》 is pronounced *tiao* and means "cicada." 《犹掇》 is pronounced *ding huo* and means "to pick up."

Confucius said: "You are skillful! Is there a Dao to this?"

Confucius’s disciple replied: “I have a Dao for this.

From the fifth to the sixth month, if I stack two pellets and do not drop them, I lose only a fraction—no more than a *zhu* or *zi*; if I stack three and do not drop them, I lose but one in ten; if I stack five and do not drop them, it is as effortless as picking them up.

I hold my body still as a withered tree stump; I steady my arm as a branch of dry wood. Though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things manifold, I attend only to the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, nor do I waver—how could I exchange the cicada’s wings for the ten thousand things and fail to grasp them?”

"The *zhu*" is pronounced *shu*.

[Three] The commentary states: the loss becomes even less.
The exposition explains: with the passage of time and the increase in stacked pellets, one in ten of the cicadas caught is lost.

[Four] The commentary states: the utmost of stillness and attentiveness, thus nothing is lost again.
The exposition explains: stacking five pellets on the pole’s end, none fall—such is the perfection of stillness and attentiveness. Thus, catching cicadas becomes as effortless as stooping to pick them up.

[Five] The commentary states: the utmost of immobility.
The exposition explains: *jū* refers to a withered, broken branch of a dead tree. *Zhí* means "to employ." I steady my body and mind like a withered tree stump, wield the pole with my arm as if it were a dry branch—so still and unmoving is this to the utmost. This is what it means to possess the Dao.
The *Shiwen* notes: *ruò jué* may also be written as *jué*; both are read *qí yuè*. *Zhū* is pronounced *zhū*. *Jū* is read *qí jū*; Guo [Xiang] reads it *jū*. Li [Yi] says: *jué* means "upright," standing straight like a stump or broken branch.

Lu Wenchang notes: the character *yě* was missing in the original block; it has been restored following the Song edition.
Jia Shifu observes: The *Liezi*’s "Yellow Emperor" chapter reads *ruò jué zhū jū*, with the commentary: "a broken stump." The *Shanhai Jing*’s "Classic of the Land Within the Seas" states: "The *jian* tree has nine *zhū*, and below it nine *jū*." Guo Pu’s commentary: "*Zhū* are twisted branches; *jū* are tangled roots." The *Shuowen* defines *zhū* as "the root of a tree." Xu Xuan adds: "Below ground it is called *gēn* (root); above ground it is called *zhū* (stump)." *Zhū jū* refers to the gnarled part near the root; *jué* is a stake made from a broken piece of wood. The body is like a severed stump, the arm like a withered branch—both convey the meaning of solidity and immobility. *Ruò gǎo* is read *kǔ lǎo*.

[Six] The exposition explains: the Two Modes are vast, the ten thousand things manifold, yet the mind’s focus and intent are fixed solely on the cicada’s wings. Beyond the cicada’s wings, there is no other object of thought.

[Seven] The commentary states: forsaking those, one attains this.
The exposition explains: *fǎn cè* means "to shift or waver." Externally, all distractions cease; internally, the mind becomes still. Though the ten thousand things abound, they do not divert awareness from the cicada’s wings. Thus, the task is as easy as gathering mustard seeds—how could one fail to succeed?

[Collation notes:]
(1) The Zhao Jianyi edition reads *jué*.
(2) The Shidetang edition omits the character *gù*.

(3) The character *shào* follows the Shidetang edition’s emendation. (4) The character *jiàn* follows the original text of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.

Confucius turned to his disciples and said: “To focus the intent without division is to congeal it in the spirit—this describes the hunchbacked elder, does it not?”

[One] The commentary states: When the mind and intent are applied with unbroken concentration, one may skillfully catch cicadas with pellets as if by divine art. Thus, the Master exhorted his followers, saying this refers to the hunchbacked elder.

[Pronunciation notes:] *Bù fēn* is read in its standard pronunciation.

◎ Yu Yue remarks: *Níng* should be *yí* ("to resemble"). Below, when Zi Qing carves wood into a *jù*, its completion astonishes onlookers as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits—this is what is meant by "congealing in the spirit." The *Liezi*’s "Yellow Emperor" chapter correctly writes *yí*, with Zhang Zhan’s commentary: "When intent is single-minded, it becomes akin to the spirit." This may be taken as grounds for correction.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: “I once crossed the abyss of Shangshen, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by divine skill. I asked him, ‘Can one learn to steer a boat?’ He replied, ‘Yes. Those skilled at swimming can do so after a few attempts. As for divers, they can operate a boat without ever having seen one before.’ I questioned him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?”

[One] The commentary states: *Shāngshēn* is the name of an abyss.

Its shape resembles a wine cup, hence the name, and it is located in the state of Song. The *jinren* refers to those who ferry people across. *Cao* means to grasp. Yan Hui once traveled through Li, crossing this abyss, where the ferryman handled the boat with such skill and ease, his movements so nimble and artful that they seemed the work of ghosts or spirits. Puzzled, Yan Hui asked the Master about it.

**Annotation:** *Caozhou* (操舟) is read with the falling tone on *cao* (七曹反). The same applies below.

**2.** **Commentary:** Though things have their inherent nature, they also require repeated practice to master.
**Annotation:** Yan Hui asked, “Can one learn this?” The ferryman replied, “Those skilled at swimming can do so after a few attempts.” Though things are endowed by nature, some must be cultivated through practice to become second nature.
**Annotation:** *Shuneng* (数能) is read with the entering tone on *shu* (音朔). The same applies to the commentary below.

**3.** **Commentary:** *Morén* refers to those who can dive deep into the water.
**Annotation:** The commentary states: *wùmò* (鹜没) means diving into the water. *Wù* is a duck. The ferryman, at ease in the water, dives beneath the surface like a duck and thus handles the boat.
**Annotation:** *Wù* (鹜) is read with the rising tone (音木), meaning duck.

Confucius said: “Those skilled at swimming can do so after a few attempts because they forget the water. As for divers who can operate a boat without ever having seen one before, to them the abyss appears like dry land, and a capsized boat seems no different from a cart rolling backward. Though countless dangers lie before them, none enter their minds—how could they not remain at ease? One who stakes tiles in a game plays skillfully, but if hooks are staked, he grows cautious; if gold is staked, he becomes flustered. His skill is the same, yet his focus shifts to external things. Those who fixate on externals are inwardly clumsy.”

**1.** **Commentary:** Through practice, it becomes second nature.
**Annotation:** Those fond of swimming grow proficient through repetition, their minds free of fear, forgetting the water.

**2.** **Commentary:** Seeing the abyss as dry land, they regard a boat capsizing in the depths as no different from a cart rolling back on a slope.
**Annotation:** Frequent swimming makes it second nature, so that even deep pools appear like solid ground. If the boat capsizes, it seems no different from a cart rolling backward on a hill.
**Annotation:** *Zhifu* (之覆) is read with the falling tone (芳服反). The same applies to the commentary below. The *Yuanjia* edition omits the character *che* (车).

**3.** **Commentary:** Though many dangers may arise, they do not weigh on his mind, for his nature is at ease.
**Annotation:** *She* (舍) refers to the mind. No matter how the boat moves or how many dangers appear before him, none disturb his thoughts. Having forgotten the water, why would he trouble his mind?
◎ Yu Yue notes: The character *wu* (物) is missing after *wan* (万). The original text reads: *fùquè wànwù fāng chén hū qián ér bùdé rù qí shě* (覆却万物方陈乎前而不得入其舍), with *fùquè wànwù* as one phrase and *fāng chén hū qián* as another. *Fāng* (方) means "together" or "alongside," derived from the original meaning of two boats side by side. The *Xunzi*’s "Zhi Shi" chapter states: *mò bù míng tōng fāng qǐ yǐ shàng jìn yǐ* (莫不明通方起以尚尽矣), with Yang Liang’s commentary: *fāng qǐ* means "arising together." The *Hanshu*’s "Yang Xiong Zhuan" reads: *suī fāng zhēng qiáo yǔ wòquán xī* (虽方征侨与偓佺兮), with Yan Shigu’s note: *fāng* means "moving alongside." Both confirm this usage. *Fāng chén hū qián* (方陈乎前) means "all things arrayed before him together." With *wu* (物) missing from the upper phrase, and *fang* (方) read as part of the preceding clause, what exactly is "arrayed before him"? Guo Xiang’s commentary states: *fùquè suī duō, ér yóu bùyǐ jīng huái* (覆却虽多，而犹不以经怀), implying his source included *wu* (物). If the text read *wànfāng* (万方) as it does now, it should refer to vastness, not multiplicity. The *Liezi*’s "Yellow Emperor" chapter correctly reads: *fùquè wànwù fāng chén hū qián ér bùdé rù qí shě* (覆却万物方陈乎前而不得入其舍), which should be used to emend the text.

**4.** **Commentary:** All encounters leave him at leisure.
**Annotation:** Steering the boat by nature, moving freely in the water, his mind unburdened—where could he not be at ease? This applies not only to boat-handling but to the study of the Dao: simply forget all concerns, and you attain mastery of life.
**Annotation:** *Wuwang* (恶往) is read with the falling tone (音乌). *Xianxia* (闲暇) is read with the rising tone (音闲).

**5.**
**Commentary:** The more weighty the stake, the more strained the mind.
**Annotation:** The *zhu* (注) here means "archery." When men wager with clay vessels or worthless objects, their minds unburdened by attachment, they shoot with skill and hit the mark. When they wager with belt hooks, the objects being slightly more valuable, fear of missing the target arises, and their minds grow anxious, causing them to fail. When they wager with gold, the most precious of stakes, their minds become strained and covetous, and their thoughts grow muddled, so they cannot hit the mark. Thus, the ferryman’s mastery arises from forgetting, while the archer’s confusion stems from clinging to things. Hence, attachment leads to clumsiness, while forgetting yields skill. Let this be a warning to all who pursue learning—take heed!
**Annotation:**
*Wazhu* (瓦注) is read with the falling-rising tone (之树反). Li [Yun] says: "to strike."
*Dan* (惮) is read as *tudan* (徒丹反), also *dan* (丹), or *zhandan* (丈旦反). It means "to dread" or "to loathe." Another gloss: "difficulty."
*(歹昏)* is read as *wudian* (武典反), also *hun* (昏), or *men* (门). Originally written as □. The *Shuowen* states: "□ means *mao* (瞀, confusion)." The *Yuanjia* edition writes *hun* (昏).
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern editions write □ as □, and *mao* (瞀) was formerly miswritten as *jin* (矜). Here corrected according to the present text.
◎ Qingfan notes: □ means "swift." The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s "Qu You" chapter states: "He who wagers with gold *shu* (殶) is *dai* (殆)." *Dai* means "doubt" (see the *Gongyang Zhuan* commentary to the fourth year of Duke Xiang), and also "confusion." The *shu* (殶) in "wagering with gold *shu*" is unattested elsewhere. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Gao* commentary also states it is unidentifiable. The *Liezi*’s "Yellow Emperor" chapter writes *wa kou* (瓦抠) for □, while the *Huainanzi*’s "Shuolin Xun" writes *jin zhi* (金鉒) for *qi* (跂), both following the *Zhuangzi* but not using the character *shu* (殶).
*Suoyao* (所要) is read as *yiyao* (一遥反).

**6.**
**Commentary:** Those who wish to nurture life and preserve the inner self must, above all, avoid attachment to anything.
**Annotation:** The archer’s mind is neither inherently skillful nor clumsy—it is the weight of external things that causes strain. The attachment to gold’s value muddles the mind, leading to confusion. This is not limited to archery; it applies to all things.
**Collation:**
(1) The *Quewu* states: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* commentary writes *shu* (殶); the rest is the same. Tian Kaizhi saw [this text] with Duke Wei of Zhou.

Duke Wei said, "I have heard that Zhu Shen studies the Way. You, sir, have associated with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?"

**Annotation:** "Studies the Way" means to pursue what is fitting and balanced.
**Exegetical Notes:**
- *Tian Kaizhi*: Li [Yi] says: *Kaizhi* is his given name.
- *Duke Wei of Zhou*: Cui [Hao]’s edition writes *Duke Wei of Zhou Zao*.
◎ Yu Yue says: The *Records of the Grand Historian*, "Annals of Zhou," states that King [Kao] (corr.) of Zhou enfeoffed his younger brother at Henan, who became Duke Huan. When Duke Huan died, his son Duke Wei succeeded him. This Duke Wei of Zhou is likely that person.
- *Suoyin* notes: According to the *Genealogical Records*, the Duke Huan of Western Zhou was named Jie and was the son of Duke Wei; the Duke of Eastern Zhou was named Ban, but Duke Wei’s name is not recorded. Cui’s edition may thus supplement the historical lacuna.
- *Zhu Shen*: The first character is read *shang* with a rising tone (六反), the second *shen* with a falling-rising tone (市轸反). The character may also be written as *Jin*, with the same pronunciation. Some editions write it as *Xian*.
- *Studies the Way*: Sima [Biao] says: It means to study the Dao of nurturing life.
- *Pursue what is fitting* (*wuzhong*): Read *dingzhong* (丁仲反). The same phrase appears in the next chapter’s annotation as *zhongshi* (中适).

**Exegesis:** His surname is Tian, his given name Kaizhi, and he is a student of the Dao. His surname is Zhu, his given name Shen, and he is a bearer of the Dao. A scion of the House of Zhou, his name is little known; he held a fief in Zhou and was posthumously titled Duke Wei. Having long heard that Zhu Shen studied the Dao of nurturing life, and knowing that Kaizhi had followed and learned from him, [Duke Wei] asked what he had heard, hoping to receive instruction in his methods.
**Exegetical Notes:**
- *You, sir, have associated with Zhu Shen*: Sima’s edition attaches *youzi* (吾子, "you, sir") to the preceding sentence and begins a new sentence with *Zi yu Zhu Shen you* (子与祝肾游, "You have associated with Zhu Shen").

**Collation:**
(1) The *kao* (考) character follows the emendation in *Yulou Zazuan*.

Tian Kaizhi said, "Kaizhi holds a broom to attend at the gate and courtyard—what could I have learned from the Master!"

**Exegesis:** Kaizhi refers to Zhu Shen as *Master*. *Bahui* means a broom. He says: I hold a broom to serve at the gate and sweep the courtyard—how dare I presume to inquire into the Master’s Dao! In ancient times, those who served their teachers all performed such tasks as holding brooms.
**Exegetical Notes:**
- *Cao* (操): Read *qicao* (七曹反).
- *Ba* (拔): Read *pomo* (蒲末反); Xu [Shen] reads *fumo* (甫末反). Li [Yi] says: It means "to grasp."
- *Hui* (篲): Read *sisui* (似岁反); Xu [Shen] reads *yizui* (以醉反); Guo [Xiang] reads *shui* (税反); Li [Yi] reads *xunhui* (寻恚反); Xin [Tang] reads *suizui* (信醉反); some read *suhu* (苏忽反). It means a broom.
◎ Lu Wenchang says: The character *you* (又) is missing before *xin* (信) in *xinzui* (信醉).
- *What could I have learned from the Master*: A complete sentence.

**Collation:**
(1) The *yu* (予) character follows the emendation in the *Exegetical Notes* and the *Shidetang* edition.

Duke Wei said, "Do not decline, Master Tian. I wish to hear it."

**Exegesis:** *Rang* means "to decline." The Dao of nurturing life is what I wish to hear—pray, do not hesitate to expound it.

Kaizhi said, "I have heard the Master say: ‘One who is good at nurturing life is like a shepherd: he watches those lagging behind and whips them.’"

**Exegesis:** I have received Zhu Shen’s teaching: nurturing life is like herding sheep—whipping those behind ensures balance.
**Exegetical Notes:**
- *Er bian* (而鞭): Read as written.
- Cui’s edition writes □, glossing it as *ni* (匿, "to hide"): He watches the weak and emaciated sheep lagging behind and hides them in the pen to nurture them.
◎ Jia Shifu says: Cui’s interpretation is incorrect. To whip those behind is to make those ahead proceed at ease. The annotation means: he watches those behind so that those ahead need not exert themselves—this is to carefully maintain the end. Guo Xiang’s annotation, "to whip those behind is to eliminate those who do not keep up," is also mistaken.

Duke Wei said, "What does that mean?"

**Exegesis:** Not yet understanding Tian Kaizhi’s words, he further raises a question.

Tian Kaizhi said, "In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who dwelt in the cliffs and drank from streams, sharing no profit with the people. Though he lived to seventy, his complexion remained that of an infant. Unfortunate, he encountered a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him.

There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented every high gate and hanging curtain, running wherever there was need. Though he lived but forty years, he died of internal heat-illness.

Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger consumed his outer form; Yi nurtured his outer form, yet illness assailed his inner self. These two men were alike in failing to whip those lagging behind."

"As for 'there was nowhere he did not run,' Sima [Biao] says: *zou* 走 means 'to arrive'; the phrase means there was no gate of wealth and nobility to which he did not arrive to pay homage. Li [Yi] says: *zou* 走 means 'to go.'

Yu Yue comments: The meaning of 'there was nowhere he did not run' is unclear. Sima’s explanation—that *zou* 走 means 'to arrive' and the phrase means there was no gate of wealth and nobility to which he did not arrive to pay homage—is also excessively circuitous. *Zou* 走 is a corrupted form of *qu* 趣. The *Li zhu* commentary on the *You tong fu* in the *Wen xuan* cites this passage as: 'There was a man named Zhang Yi; there was no gate with hanging curtains to which he did not hasten in pursuit of righteousness.' The character is correctly written as *qu* 趣, though the word *yi* 義 is superfluous. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* in the 'Bi yi' chapter states: 'Zhang Yi was fond of reverence; wherever there were gates, hanging curtains, or gatherings of people, there was nowhere he did not hasten.' Gao You’s commentary says: 'He would hasten whenever he passed by.' The *Huainanzi* in the 'Ren jian' chapter says: 'Zhang Yi was fond of reverence; when passing palaces, halls, or ancestral temples, he would invariably hasten; when seeing gates, gatherings of people, or crowds, he would invariably dismount. To grooms, stable-hands, and charioteers, he would extend equal courtesy. Yet he did not live out his years, dying of internal heat.' The meaning is even clearer. The *Zhuangzi*’s text is not [complete/clear], and thus scholars have been unable to grasp its meaning."

[3] The Commentary states: One who adheres to a single method to the point of excess misses the harmony of comprehensive integration. To whip the straggler is to correct what falls short.

The Subcommentary explains: Shan Bao, with few desires and a pure emptiness, cultivated his inner virtue, yet a tiger devoured his outer form. Zhang Yi, engaging with the world’s nobility, nurtured his physical frame, yet illness assailed his inner self unto death. These two men, each clinging to one extreme, failed to strike the mean—thus neither was whipped for lagging behind.

The *Exegesis* notes: *Qu qi* ("to remove it") is read *qǐ lǚ*.

The Collation records: The *Que wu* cites Liu Deyi’s edition, which includes the character *jian* ("to see") before *gao* ("high").

Confucius said: "Do not enter only to conceal, do not emerge only to display, but stand like withered wood at the center. Should one attain these three, one’s name will surely reach its apex. Those who fear the road—where ten travelers are killed and one survives—will have fathers, sons, and brothers warning one another, mustering a great retinue before daring to set out. Are they not wise? Yet what people truly fear lies upon the sleeping mat and amid food and drink, and because they fail to guard against it, they err."

The Commentary on the first clause: To conceal is already internal, yet to enter further is to overdo entry.

The Subcommentary: The commentary states: to enter is already entry, yet to conceal it further. Clinging to seclusion—this is Shan Bao.

The Commentary on the second clause: To display is already external, yet to emerge further is to overdo emergence.

The Subcommentary: *Yang* means "to manifest." To emerge is already emergence, yet to display it further. Clinging to emergence—this is Zhang Yi.

The Commentary on the third clause: To stand like withered wood, without intent yet perfectly balanced—this is the proper stance.

The Subcommentary: *Chai* means "wood." Neither clinging to emergence nor to seclusion, transcending both, like withered wood devoid of feeling, one abandons the two extremes and stands alone in the Dao of the central mean.

The Commentary on the fourth clause: When the name reaches its apex, the reality is fitting.

The Subcommentary: Names arise from principles, and principles generate names. Should one grasp the meaning of the preceding three phrases, then principle is exhausted and the name reaches its apex. Alternatively: attaining these three, one is named a person who has realized the ultimate.

The Subcommentary on the fifth clause: *Tu* means "road." When a road harbors bandits and perils to be feared, and of ten travelers, one is killed, kin will warn one another not to venture lightly. They gather a strong retinue, form a large company, assess the safety, and only then dare to proceed. How could they not know to preserve their lives and avoid harm?

The *Exegesis* notes: *Wei tu*—Sima Biao explains: "dangerous roads to be feared." *Zu tu*—read *zǐ hū*. *Yi zhi*—read as *zhì*.

The Commentary on the sixth clause: One in ten is killed, and they grow greatly fearful. Yet when it comes to the harms of sensual desire, all rush toward death without hesitation—this is a grave error.

The Subcommentary: *Ren* refers to clothing. On perilous roads, where one in ten is killed, people still caution one another and dare not proceed lightly. How much more so amid food and drink, where they fail to regulate themselves, or upon the sleeping mat, where they indulge in excess, rushing toward death with not one in ten thousand spared. The whole world acts thus—deep is the transgression.

The *Exegesis* notes: *Ren*—read *ér shèn* or *ér zhèn*. Li explains: "sleeping garment." Zheng’s commentary on the *Liji* states: "sleeping mat." *Dong jie zhi si di*—one edition omits *di*. *Bu mao*—read *mò*.

The Collation records: The *Que wu* cites the Jiangnan ancient edition, which has *qu* ("to take") as *zui* ("most").

The invocator Yuan Duan, officiating at the sacrificial pen, addressed the pig with a goad, saying: "Why do you hate death? I shall fatten you for three months, purify you for ten days, fast for three, spread white couch grass, and place your shoulders and haunches upon the carved platter—would you agree to this?" Counseling the pig, he said: Better to be fed husks and dregs and left in the pen. For himself, however, he would choose to live with the honor of a high carriage and cap, and in death to lie upon a painted bier amid the gathered mourners. Counseling the pig, he rejects it; for himself, he accepts it. How does he differ from the pig?

The Subcommentary: *Zhu* means "invocator," like the Six Invocators of the Grand Sacrificer today.

Yuan Duan wore the ceremonial cap and robes. *Ce* means "pen." *Zhi* means "pig." When offering sacrifices to the ancestral temples, there must be an invocator, fully attired in the *yuan*-crown and robes, holding a tablet while making offerings to the spirits. Before the sacrifice, he would stand by the pen and address the pig. The text of his address to the pig follows below.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Lao ce*: *Lao* is read as *chū* in the initial *gé* tone. Li [Yun] says: *Lao* is the pig’s stall; *ce* is the wooden fence.
*Shuō*: Read as written, or as *shuì* in the *shǐ ruì* tone.
*Zhì*: Read as *zhí lì*. Originally also written as *shǐ* (pig).

**Subcommentary:**
*Huan* means "to rear." *Zu* is the vessel for holding meat, here referring to the carved platter. Addressing the pig, he said: "Why do you seek to live well yet hate death? I shall rear you with fine food, purify you through fasting, spread white couch grass for the spirits’ seat, and place your body upon the platter—would you not wish for such treatment?"

The pronunciation of *huàn* is "患." Sima [Biao] says: It means "to rear." Originally also written as *xī*. *Rì qí* is pronounced *zè jiē* in the initial tone; the same applies in the following chapter. *Jiè* is pronounced *zài yè*, or alternatively *zài yì*. *Kāo* is pronounced *kū gāo*. *Diāo zǔ* is pronounced *zhuāng lǚ*—a platter adorned with carvings.

**Annotation:**
To seek abundance is to court the loss of one’s body; this principle holds equally true, with no distinction between humans and beasts.

**Subcommentary:**
*Cuò* means "to place." *Tuán* refers to painted adornments; *shǔn* is the hearse, meaning the decorated funeral carriage. *Jù lǚ* refers to the coffin and outer coffin. For the pig, a better plan would be to leave it in its pen, feeding it only distillers’ grains and chaff, without white couch grass or carved platters. Yet for oneself, one clings to life with the honor of riding in a grand carriage and wearing a crown, and in death is placed in a coffin, borne upon a hearse—would one not wish for such treatment? Why, then, for the pig’s sake, reject white couch grass and carved platters, while for one’s own sake, seek carriages and crowns and hearses? What difference is there between oneself and the pig? This is nothing but inverted folly, failing to grasp the nature of life.

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*Wèi zhì*: pronounced *yú wěi*; the same applies to *zì wèi* and *wèi zhì* below.
*Shí yǐ*: pronounced *sì*.
*Kāng*: pronounced *kāng*.
*Zāo*: pronounced *zāo*.
*Cuò zhī*: pronounced *qī gù*, meaning "to place"; also read as written. Originally also written as *措*.
*Tuán*: pronounced *zhí zhuǎn*, or alternatively *chì zhuǎn*.
*Shǔn*: pronounced *shí zhǔn*; Xu Shen reads it *chì xún*, while Li [Xun] reads it *chì zhǔn*. Sima [Biao] says: *Tuán* is like *zhuàn* (carved patterns); *shǔn* is like *àn* (a tray).
*Jù lǚ*: pronounced *lì zhǔ*. Sima [Biao] says: *Jù lǚ* is the name of a vessel, now used in tombs. Another opinion: *Jù lǚ* refers to the coffin and outer coffin. Yet another: *Jù* should be written as *zōu* (pronounced *cái guān*), and *lǚ* as *lóu* (pronounced *lì jiǔ*), meaning burial in a coffin coated with *zōu* and *lóu* and covered with *shà*.

◎Wang Niansun says: The *Shiwen* cites Sima [Biao] as saying *tuán* is like *zhuàn* (carved patterns), *shǔn* is like *àn* (a tray), and *jù lǚ* is the name of a vessel, now used in tombs. Another opinion: *jù lǚ* refers to the coffin and outer coffin. Yet another: *jù* should be written as *zōu*, and *lǚ* as *lóu*, meaning burial in a coffin coated with *zōu* and *lóu* and covered with *shà*. Now, *tuán* should be read as *quán*, referring to the hearse. Miscellaneous Records states that the hearse is called *shū chē*, and Zheng’s annotation says: *Shū* is read as *quán*. The *Rites of Mourning for a Scholar* (lower chapter) annotation says: the hearse for bearing the coffin. The *Rites of Zhou* calls it *shèn chē*; the *Miscellaneous Records* calls it *tuán*; it may also be written as *quán* or *tán*, all with similar pronunciations. The carriage’s body resembles a bed, with a central shaft extending front and back, fitted with front and rear yokes. The body has four sides, and below, front and back axles, with *quán* as the wheels. Xu Shen says: wheels with spokes are called *lún*; those without are called *quán*. *Quán*, *shū*, *tán*, and *tuán* are variant characters with the same meaning; here written as *tuán*, the meaning is the same. *Shǔn* should be read as *chūn*, also referring to the hearse. The *Tan Gong* says: For the Son of Heaven’s burial, the coffin is coated with *zōu* and borne on a dragon-painted *chūn* with an outer coffin. It also says: The Son of Heaven’s coffin is borne on a dragon-painted *chūn* with an outer shroud; feudal lords use an undecorated *chūn* with a shroud. The *Major Records of Mourning* says: The lord’s burial uses a *chūn*, and Zheng’s annotation says: For the Son of Heaven’s burial, the coffin rests on a dragon-painted *chūn*; feudal lords use a *chūn* without dragon paintings, while great officers do not use a *chūn*. The *Rites of Mourning for a Scholar* (lower chapter) annotation says: The *quán* resembles a long bed, with a frame, front and back fitted with metal, and axles locked in place. For great officers and above, it has four sides and is called *chūn*. (This refers to its use in ancestral temples.) *Chūn* and *shǔn* are interchangeable in ancient script. The *Miscellaneous Records* annotation says: the coffin is borne on a *shǔn*, which confirms this. *Jù lǚ* refers to the hearse’s adornments. As many decorations are gathered, it is called *jù lǚ*; also, its shape is high in the center and low on all sides, hence the name *lǚ*. The *Miscellaneous Records* annotation says: When about to bury, the hearse’s adornments are called *liǔ*. The *Rites of Zhou*’s *Feng Ren* says: to clothe the *liǔ* and *shà* materials. The annotation says: *Liǔ* means "gathered," referring to the gathering of all five adornments. Liu Xi’s *Explanation of Names* says: The carriage for bearing the coffin, its cover is called *liǔ*. *Liǔ* means "gathered," as all adornments are gathered there; its shape is also *lǚ*. The *Tan Gong* says: to set up *lóu shà*. Xunzi’s *Discourse on Rites* says: without *zhū*, silk threads, or *lǚ* threads, the *shà* is made to resemble the *fēi* curtains and *chóu wèi* shrouds. *Liǔ*, *lóu*, *lǚ*, and *lǚ* are variant characters with the same meaning. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Moderation in Mourning* chapter says: *lǚ shà* to supervise it. The character is also written as *lǚ*. The *Shiwen*’s alternate explanation, taking *lǚ* as the character for *lóu shà*, is correct. The other explanations are mistaken.

◎Jia Shifu says: The *Shiwen* cites Sima [Biao] as saying *tuán* is like *zhuàn* (carved patterns), *shǔn* is like *àn* (a tray), and *jù lǚ* is the name of a vessel, now used in tombs. I suspect *shǔn* is the same as *chūn*, and *tuán shǔn* refers to the painted *chūn*, as in the *Major Records of Mourning*’s "burial uses a *chūn*." *Jù lǚ* refers to the *qū bù* (curved bamboo screen), which Xunzi calls *bù qì* (screen vessels), and the *Major Records of Mourning* calls *āo*—for the lord, eight baskets; for a great officer, six; for a scholar, four. The *chūn* is used to bear the coffin, hence the phrase "upon the *tuán shǔn*"; the baskets and bamboo containers are placed between the outer coffin and the inner coffin, hence the phrase "within the *jù lǚ*." Both are burial adornments for great officers and above.

Duke Huan was hunting in the marshes, with Guan Zhong driving his chariot, when he saw a ghost. The Duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked, “What did you see, Father Zhong?” Guan Zhong replied, “Your servant saw nothing.”

**Annotation:**
The Duke here is Duke Huan of Qi, named Xiaobai. While hunting in the wild marshes, he had Guan Yiwu drive his chariot. The Duke, having seen a ghost, was seized by fear and grasped Guan Zhong’s hand to ask him. Guan Zhong answered, “Your servant saw nothing.” This passage illustrates that all manner of illnesses and afflictions often arise from groundless attachments.

The Duke returned and fell ill with lethargy, remaining secluded for days. A Qi scholar named Huangzi Gao’ao said, “The Duke has harmed himself—how could a ghost harm him? When the qi of pent-up anger disperses without returning, it leads to deficiency. If it rises without descending, it makes one prone to rage; if it sinks without rising, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it neither rises nor sinks but lodges in the center of the body, at the heart, it causes illness.”

**Annotation:**
*Ēiyí* describes a state of listlessness, also indicating a troubled and restless demeanor. Having seen the ghost, the Duke returned in distress and fell ill, hence his seclusion.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
One variant reads "the Duke returned" as "公反."
**Note by Lu Wenchang:** The modern text reads "公反."

The entry *èi* (诶) is pronounced *yú* in the *dài* tone according to the *fǎn* system, while Guo reads it as *xī*. The *Shuowen* states: "An exclamation of disdain." Li pronounces it *gāi* in the *fǎn* tone, with another reading as *āi*. The entry *yí* (诒) is pronounced *tǔ* in the *dài* tone according to the *fǎn* system, while Guo reads it as *yí*, and Li as *tái*. Sima states: "An appearance of weariness." Li says: "*Èiyí* describes the loss of one’s ethereal and corporeal souls." The entry *shù rì* (数日) is pronounced *suǒ zhǔ* in the *fǎn* tone. Sima’s edition reads *shù yuè* (数月).

The commentary notes: Huangzi, styled Gao’ao, was a worthy man of Qi. Upon hearing that the Duke was ill, he came to inquire, saying, "The Duke has bound himself with groundless worries, thus bringing harm upon himself. What power do ghosts possess to injure the Duke?" He sought to dispel the Duke’s ailment with sound reasoning.

The phonetic gloss: *Huángzǐ Gào’áo* (皇子告敖) is read as written. Sima states: "Huang is the surname; Gao’ao, the style; a worthy scholar of Qi." Yu Yue notes: The *Guangyun*, in the *zi* section of the sixth rhyme, states: "There are eleven compound surnames, among which is Huangzi, as seen in the *Zhuangzi*, where Huangzi Gao’ao appears." Thus, Huangzi is a compound surname. The *Liezi*, in the "Tang Wen" chapter, records the tale of the Kunwu sword and fire-washed cloth, stating that Huangzi deemed such things nonexistent—likely referring to the same person. *Guǐ è* (鬼恶) is pronounced *wū*.

The commentary explains: When one is enraged, perverse qi accumulates. As the essence and spirit disperse and fail to return to the body, the heart becomes deficient and vulnerable to spiritual affliction, leading to insufficiency in the Dao.

The phonetic gloss: *Fèn* (忿) is pronounced *fú fěn* in the *fǎn* tone, while Li reads it as *fáng fěn*. *Chù* (滀) is pronounced *chì liù* in the *fǎn* tone. Regarding "the qi of pent-up anger disperses without returning, leading to deficiency," Li states: "*Fèn* means fullness; *chù*, accumulation. When the spirit is obstructed, yin and yang congeal within, while the ethereal and corporeal souls scatter without, hence the term 'deficiency.'"

The commentary further elaborates: If perverse qi rises without descending, it attacks the head, causing fear in the heart and a propensity for rage. If it sinks without rising, yang is suppressed and yin dissipated, leaving the spirit disoriented and forgetfulness prevalent. The heart is the ruler of the five viscera and the dwelling of the numinous spirit; thus, when qi lodges at the heart, illness ensues.

The phonetic gloss: *Shàng* (上) is pronounced *shí zhǎng* in the *fǎn* tone, with the same pronunciation for subsequent instances.

"When *qi* fails to descend, it causes a propensity for rage; when it fails to ascend, it causes a propensity for forgetfulness." *Wáng* is pronounced *shàng* in the *fǎn* tone.

Li states: "Yang disperses and yin congeals, hence rage; yin arises and yang is suppressed, hence forgetfulness."

"Neither ascending nor descending, [lodging] in the middle": *Dīng zhòng* in the *fǎn* tone.

"Lodging at the heart causes illness": Li states: "When above and below are disharmonious, yin and yang contend and attack the heart. The heart is the ruler of the spirit; thus, illness arises."

**Emendation:** The character *shì* is supplied following *Zhūzǐ Píngyì*.

Duke Huan said: "In that case, are there ghosts?"
He replied: "There are. In the depths of water, *Lǚ*; in the stove, *Jì*. In the foul soil within doorways, *Léitíng* dwells; beneath the northeast corner, *Bèi’ā Guīlóng* leaps; beneath the northwest corner, *Yìyáng* dwells. In water, *Wǎngxiàng*; in mounds, *Zhēn*; in mountains, *Kuí*; in the wilds, *Pánghuáng*; in marshes, *Wēiyí*."

**Annotation 1:** The Duke inquires into the cause, and the answer affirms the existence of ghosts.
**Annotation 2:** In the depths of water—within the filthy mud—there is a ghost named *Lǚ*. The stove god appears as a beautiful woman clad in red, called *Jì*.

**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Shěn yǒu Lǚ*": Sima’s version reads *Shěn yǒu Lòu*, explaining: *Shěn* refers to murky water and mud; *Lòu* is the name of the spirit.
◎ Yu Yue notes: Sima states that *shěn* means filthy water and mud, so it should follow the phrase about *Wǎngxiàng* in water, not precede the stove god. *Shěn* should be *chén* (stove). *Chén* is phonetically akin to *shěn* (both share the *shèn* sound in *shuōwén*). The *Dàng* ode of the *Book of Songs* reads *qí mìng fēi chén*, while the *Shuōwén*’s *xīn* section cites it as *tiān mìng fēi chén*; the *Chángdì* ode reads *hélè qiě zhàn*, while the *Lǐjì*’s *Zhōngyōng* chapter cites it as *hélè qiě dān*. This demonstrates the interchangeability of *chén* with *chén* (sincerity) and *zhàn* with *dān*. Thus, *chén* (stove) being written as *shěn* is akin to *chén* (sincerity) being written as *chén* and *zhàn* as *dān*. The *Báihuā* ode states *áng hōng yú chén*, with the Mao commentary: "*Chén* means stove." Since stove and *chén* are of the same category, they are mentioned together: "*Chén* has *Lǚ*; the stove has *Jì*." Zheng’s *Píchén* is written as *Zào*; *chén* is a loan for *chén*. The *Hànshū*’s *Gǔjīn Rénbiǎo* writes it as *Pízhàn*, where *zhàn* is also a loan for *chén*. Li Shan’s commentary on *Wénxuǎn*’s *Zōu Yáng’s Letter to the King of Wú* states: "*Zhàn* is now the *shěn* character"; his note on *Dá Bīn Xì* reads: "*Zhàn* is the ancient *shěn* character." Thus, taking *shěn* as *chén* is equivalent to taking *zhàn* as *chén*.
"*Zào yǒu Jì*": Pronounced *jié* (Lu Deming), *hújié* in the *fǎn* tone (Xu), *jí* (Guo), or *jí* (Li). Sima explains: "*Jì* is the stove god, clad in red, appearing as a beautiful woman."
◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Suǒyǐn* to the *Shǐjì*’s *Xiàowǔ Běnjì* cites Sima, writing *Jì* as *Hào*, explaining: "*Hào* is the stove god, resembling a beautiful woman in red."

**Annotation 3:** In the foul soil within doorways, there is a ghost named *Léitíng*.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Tíng*": Pronounced *tíng*, also *tǐng*, or *tùnìng* in the *fǎn* tone.

**Annotation 4:** Beneath the northeast corner of a dwelling, there is a ghost named *Bèi’ā Guīlóng*, which leaps about like a child, one *chǐ* and four *cùn* tall, clad in black with a red headscarf, wielding a sword and halberd.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Bèi*": Pronounced *péi* (Lu), or *fúlái* in the *fǎn* tone (Xu). "*Ā Guī*": Also written as *wā*; pronounced *hùwā* in the *fǎn* tone (Lu), or *hújiā* in the *fǎn* tone (Xu). "*Lóng*": Pronounced *lóng*, also *lóng*. "*Yuè zhī*": Sima explains: "*Bèi’ā* is the name of the spirit. *Guīlóng* resembles a child, one *chǐ* and four *cùn* tall, clad in black with a red headscarf and large hat, wielding a sword and halberd."

**Annotation 5:** With the head of a leopard and the tail of a horse, named *Yìyáng*.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Yìyáng*": Pronounced *yì*. Sima explains: "*Yìyáng* has the head of a leopard and the tail of a horse" (one version reads "dog’s head"). Another version states it is the name of a spirit.

**Annotation 6:** The commentary (note 3) describes it as resembling a child, black in color, clad in red, with large ears and long arms, named *Wǎngxiàng*.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Wǎngxiàng*": Read as written. Sima’s version reads *Wúshāng*, explaining: "Resembling a child, red-black in color, with red claws, large ears, and long arms." Another version states it is the name of a water spirit.

**Annotation 7:** It resembles a dog, has horns, and its body is patterned.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Zhēn*": Also written as *shēn*; pronounced *suǒzhēn* in the *fǎn* tone, or *zhēn*. Sima explains: "Resembling a dog, with horns and a body adorned in five colors."

**Annotation 8:** As large as an ox, resembling a drum, and walks on one foot.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Kuí*": Pronounced *qiúguī* in the *fǎn* tone. Sima explains: "Resembling a drum and walking on one foot."

**Annotation 9:** It resembles a snake, has two heads, and is multicolored.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Fāng*": Pronounced *bàng*. Also written as *páng*, same pronunciation. The *Huáng* edition writes it as *huáng*, same pronunciation. Sima explains: "*Fānghuáng* resembles a snake, has two heads, and is adorned in five colors."
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern editions write it as *pánghuáng*.

**Emendation:** The character *wǎng* is amended following the *Shìdétáng* edition.
**Emendation:** The character *wū* is supplied following the phonetic gloss.

The Duke said: "May I ask what *Wēiyí* looks like?"
**Annotation 1:** Duke Huan encountered ghosts in the marsh and, having heard of *Wēiyí*, inquired about its appearance.
**Phonetic Gloss:** "*Wēi*": Pronounced *yúwēi* in the *fǎn* tone, or as written.

Huangzi said: "*Wēiyí* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a carriage shaft, clad in purple with a vermilion cap."

The creature, when it hears the rumbling of thunder-chariots, clutches its head and stands upright. Those who encounter it will nearly attain hegemony."

Duke Huan broke into a beaming smile and said, "This is precisely what I saw!"

Thereupon, he straightened his robes and cap and sat with Huangzi. Before the day was out, he was unaware that his illness had departed.

**Annotation 1:** *Zhěn* describes a joyful, laughing expression. *Dài* means "nearly." To see *Wēiyí* is to be on the verge of becoming a hegemon. Hearing this, Duke Huan laughed heartily and exclaimed, "What I saw was exactly this!"

**Phonetic Gloss:** *Zhūguān*: Sima’s edition writes *yúguān*, explaining it as a cap from the state of Yu, shaped like a conch. *Wù wén léi*: *Wù* is pronounced *wūlù*. *Pěng*: Pronounced *fǎngyǒng*. *Qí shǒu*: Sima’s edition matches this; one variant writes *shǒu* ("hands"). *Zhěn*: Pronounced *chǐyǐn*; Xu’s edition gives *chǐyī*; also *chǐsī*. Sima explains it as a smiling expression; Li explains it as a broad smile.

**Annotation 2:** This passage illustrates that when worries arise, afflictions follow—this is ignorance. When suffering departs and one’s nature is restored, this is understanding the Dao.
**Exegesis:** Hearing of *Wēiyí*, Duke Huan felt such delight that he straightened his attire and engaged in conversation. Before the day ended, his spirits were so uplifted that he no longer knew where his illness had gone.

Jì Shěngzǐ raised fighting cocks for the king.

**Annotation 1:** Surnamed Jì, named Shěngzǐ (also written as *Xiāo*, read accordingly). He raised cocks for the King of Qi to prepare them for combat. This passage shows that one need not be born with innate understanding of the natural Dao—cultivation through practice can also shape one’s nature.

**Phonetic Gloss:** *Jì Shěng*: Pronounced *suǒjǐng*; Xu’s edition gives *suǒxìng*. A person’s name; one variant writes *Xiāo*. *Wéi*: Pronounced *yúwěi*. *Wáng*: Sima explains this as the King of Qi.
◎ Yú Yuè notes: The *Liezi*’s "Emperor Huang" chapter also records this event, stating that Jì Shěngzǐ raised fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou, not the King of Qi.

After ten days, the king asked, "Are the cocks ready?"
He replied, "Not yet. They are still hollowly arrogant, relying on their qi."

**Annotation 1:** After ten days of training, the king asked, "Are they fit for combat?" He answered, "Their nature remains haughty, clinging to their pride and vigor, so they are not yet ready."

**Phonetic Gloss:** *Xūjiāo*: Pronounced *jūqiáo*; also *jùxiāo*. Li explains it as "lofty"; Sima explains it as "holding the head high."

After another ten days, the king asked again.
He replied, "Not yet. They still react to shadows and reflections."

◎ **Annotation 1:** Upon seeing or hearing other cocks, they still respond as if echoing shapes and sounds.
**Phonetic Gloss:** *Yóu yìng*: "Yìng" as in "response." The same below. *Xiàng*: Pronounced *xǔ zhàng* (許丈反); also written as 響. *Jǐng*: Pronounced *yú lǐng* (于領反), or as the common reading.

After another ten days, the king asked again.
He replied, "Not yet. Their gaze remains sharp and their qi still surges."

**Annotation 1:** Their glances are swift and fierce, their spirit and qi overbearing; their minds have not yet settled, so they are not yet ready.

After another ten days, the king asked again.
He replied, "Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they show no reaction. From a distance, they seem like wooden cocks— their virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee instead."

**Annotation 1:** *Jǐ*: Fully. Free from arrogance, their minds at peace, though other cocks may crow, they remain unmoved. The art of rearing fighting cocks reaches its perfection here.
**Commentary:** This passage speaks of nurturing to the point of wholeness, rendering one invincible to external challenges—how much more so when one attains wholeness within!
**Annotation:** With spirit settled and form composed, they appear from afar like wooden cocks—unmoving, unstartled. Their virtue is fully realized. Other cocks, upon seeing them, flee; none in the world dare challenge them.

**Textual Note:** The variant cited in *Quēwù* includes an additional "见" (*jiàn*, "see") before "者" in the line "异鸡无敢应者," following the versions of Rú Hǎi and Liú Déyī.

Confucius observed the Lüliang Falls, where the water plunged thirty *rèn* and its froth surged forty *lǐ*—a torrent even *yuán*, *tuó*, fish, and turtles could not swim.

Seeing a man swimming there, Confucius thought he was in distress and wished to die, so he sent his disciples downstream to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he strolled and swam beneath the embankment.

**Annotation:** Lüliang is the name of a waterfall. Interpretations differ: some say it refers to the place where the Yellow River cuts through the mountains in Lishi of Xihe, called Lüliang; others claim it is the Dragon Gate two hundred *lǐ* from Puzhou, where the river cascades down, also named Lüliang; still others identify it as Lüliang in Pengcheng County of Song. Eight *chǐ* make one *rèn*, so the height is reckoned at twenty-four *zhàng*. The present waterfall, however, is described as precipitously high—likely an allegory, exaggerated beyond reality. The *yuán* resembles a turtle but is larger; the *tuó* is fish-like but has legs. With the waterfall so high and its current so swift, the churning rapids send foam surging forty *lǐ*, making even aquatic creatures unable to swim—how much less could land-dwelling beings cross!

**Textual Note:** *Lüliang*—Sima [Biao] says: "A place where the river is cut off by rocks." Today, west of Lishi in Xihe, there is such a place where the river is severed, commonly called Huangliang. The *Huainanzi* states: "In ancient times, before the Dragon Gate was carved, the river flowed above Mengmen." ◎Qingfan’s note: The *Taiping Yulan* (183) cites the *Jun Guo Zhi*, which quotes Sima [Biao] as saying Lüliang is the Dragon Gate—less detailed than the *Shiwen*. *Xuan shui*—pronounced *xuán*.

《三十仞》*rèn*, pronounced *rèn*; seven *chǐ* make one *rèn*.
《流沫》*mò*, pronounced *mò*.
《鼋》*yuán*, pronounced *yuán*.
《鼍》*tuó*, *túduō* reflex or sometimes pronounced *tán*.
《鳖》This character is also written as 鼈, *biē*, pronounced *bìmiè*.

◎ **Annotation [2]**
The surging rapids boil and seethe, beyond human ability to swim. Suddenly seeing a man, one would think him drowned and in distress, so he commanded his disciples to follow the current and rescue him.

**Textual Note:**
《有苦》Read as written.
Sima [Biao] says: "Afflicted."
《拯之》The *zhěng* of "to rescue."

◎ **Annotation [3]**
A *táng* is a bank. Having grown at ease in the water, he let his hair loose and walked singing, carefree and untroubled, strolling beneath the bank.

**Textual Note:**
《数百》*shùbǎi*, pronounced *shǔzhǔ*.
《被发》*pīfà*, pronounced *píjì*.
《行歌》Sima’s version reads *xíngdào*. *Dào* means the path one habitually follows.

Confucius followed and questioned him, saying: "I took you for a ghost, but observing you closely, you are a man. May I ask: is there a *Dao* to treading water?"¹

¹ **Annotation [1]**
The man feared neither the rushing waves nor the singing current, so Confucius, marveling at this, followed and asked: "I thought you a spirit, but on closer inspection, you are a man. You tread deep waters—do you possess some *Dao* or technique?"

He replied: "No, I have no *Dao*. I began with what was familiar, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny. I enter with the swirling currents and emerge with the surging flows, following the water’s *Dao* without imposing my own will. This is how I tread it."

**Annotation [1]**
He answered: "I possess no technique—only long practice that has become skill, habituation that has shaped my nature."

**Annotation [2]**
"At first, I was born on land and thus became accustomed to it as my old home. Later, I grew up in the water, and through habit, it became my nature. Once water became my nature, my heart knew no fear, and I gave myself freely to it, merging with the natural decree of Heaven."

**Textual Note:**
《长乎》*zhǎnghū*, pronounced *dīngzhàng*. The same below.

**Annotation [3]**
The whirling water that grinds like a millstone as it enters is called *qí*; the churning water that wells up and bursts forth is called *gǔ*. Since I move in harmony with the water, my actions accord with Heaven’s decree, so I enter and emerge with the *qí* and *gǔ*, never giving it a second thought.

**Commentary:**
The water that grinds like a millwheel as it swirls inward is *qí*; the water that surges and overflows as it returns outward is *gǔ*.

**Textual Note:**
《与齐》Sima: *qí* is the water that swirls like a millwheel.
Guo: The water that grinds like a millwheel as it swirls inward is *qí*.
◎ Qing scholar Lu Wenchao’s note: *Qí* refers to the center of things. In the *Lü Xing*, it says, "Heaven *qí*s the people," and Ma’s commentary explains: "*Qí* means the center." In the *Guanzi*’s "Zheng Shi" chapter, it states, "In governance, nothing is more precious than attaining *qí*," meaning the center. (Wang Niansun notes: The navel is located at the center of the abdomen, hence it is called *qí*. *Qí* is *qí*.) In the *Han Shu*’s "Jiao Si Zhi," it says, "*Qí* is so called because it is the *qí* of Heaven," and Su Lin’s commentary explains: "The central *qí* of Heaven." This aligns with Sima’s interpretation of *qí* as swirling water like a millwheel.
《与汨》*yǔgǔ*, pronounced *húhū*.

Sima: It surges as waves.
Guo: The water that swirls and dips before surging forth is *gǔ*.
【4】【Annotation】Yield to the water, not to oneself.
【Exegesis】Follow the water, entrusting oneself to its flow, without allowing private inclinations to resist or refuse. If even yielding to water is thus, how much more should one follow only the Dao!

【5】【Exegesis】There is no other Daoist technique; the principle is fully expounded here.

【Collation】(1) The character *huí* (回) is amended following the original text of the *Shi Wen*.

Confucius said: “What is meant by ‘originating in *gù*, growing in *xìng*, and completing in *mìng*’?”
【1】【Exegesis】As this purport remains unclear, let us explain it again.

He replied: “I was born on a hill and am at ease on a hill—this is *gù*. I grew up by the water and am at ease by the water—this is *xìng*. I do not know why it is so, yet it is so—this is *mìng*.”
【1】【Annotation】This passage speaks of how people possess partial abilities. If one attains what they are capable of and yields to it, then nothing in the world is difficult. Applying this principle of effortless action to traverse the Dao of ceaseless generation, where could one not succeed!

【Exegesis】These three meanings have already been explained earlier; there is no need for further elucidation.

Ziqing carved wood into a *jù*. When the *jù* was completed, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits.
Duke of Lu saw it and asked, “What technique did you use to make it?”
【1】【Annotation】It did not seem like something made by human hands.

Ziqing, whose surname was Zi and given name Qing, was the Grand Artificer of Lu. Some say: *Zi* was his official title; *jù* was a musical instrument resembling the *jiāzhōng* bell. Others say: the *jù* resembled a tiger, carved from wood. Its carving and craftsmanship were so exquisite that they seemed unlike human work—those who saw it were astonished and suspected it was the work of ghosts or spirits.

【Exegesis】His surname was Zi, his given name Qing, and he was the Grand Artificer of Lu. It is also said: *Zi* was his official title; *jù* was a musical instrument resembling the *jiāzhōng* bell. Another account says: the *jù* resembled a tiger, carved from wood. Its intricate carving and skillful craftsmanship did not resemble human labor, so those who saw it were amazed and doubted, believing it to be the work of ghosts or spirits.

【Pronunciation Notes】*Zǐ* is pronounced *Zǐ*. *Qìng*: Li says he was the Grand Artificer of Lu. *Zǐ* was the official title; *Qìng* was his given name. ◎ Yu Yue says: In the *Zuǒzhuàn* of the fourth year of Duke Xiāng, the artisan Qìng addressed Jì Wénzǐ. Du’s commentary states: “Artisan Qìng was the Grand Artificer of Lu.” This is the same Zǐ Qìng. *Jù* is pronounced *jù*. Sima says: It is a musical instrument resembling the *jiāzhōng* bell.

【2】【Exegesis】The Duke of Lu, seeing its divine marvel, found it strange and asked: “What technique did you use to make this *jù*?”
He replied: “I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Nevertheless, there is one thing. When I was about to make the *jù*, I never dared to deplete my *qi*, but always fasted to still my mind.

【1】After fasting for three days, I dared not harbor thoughts of rewards, honors, or emoluments.
After five days, I dared not harbor thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness.
After seven days, I suddenly forgot I had limbs and a body.
At that time, I was without the court of the duke, my skill became concentrated, and my external bones dissolved.

Then I entered the mountain forest to observe the natural dispositions of things. Only when the form was fully realized in my mind did the *jù* appear, and only then did I set my hand to it. If not, I would stop. Thus, I united Heaven with Heaven—this is why the vessel seems divine!”

【1】【Exegesis】Zi replied: “I am but a craftsman of skill—what art could I possess? Though it is so, there is one method. When I wished to make the *jù*, I never dared to cling to distractions or deplete my spirit and *qi*, but always fasted and purified myself to still my mind.”

【Pronunciation Notes】*Hào* is pronounced *hūbào*.

Sima [Qian] says: “[损] means depletion.”
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The modern text writes *hào* (耗), which is incorrect.
《Qi》 Li [Yi] says: When *qi* is depleted, the mind stirs; when the mind stirs, the spirit is not concentrated.

【2】【Exegesis】Once the mind’s traces were aligned, for three days thereafter, matters such as congratulations and condolences, rewards and punishments, official ranks and emoluments—all such affairs—no longer entered the field of emotion.

【3】【Exegesis】As the days of fasting multiplied, the spirit gradually stilled, enabling both praise and blame to be doubly relinquished, skill and clumsiness alike forgotten.

【Pronunciation Notes】*Fēi yù* is pronounced *yú*.

【4】【Commentary】Gazing upon the duke’s court as if it were nothing, all longing and admiration ceased.
【Exegesis】*Zhérán*: not daring to alter one’s bearing. After prolonged purification, with emotions and intentions cleansed and empty, the hundred limbs and four extremities were all forgotten at once, remaining utterly still, equal to withered wood. Having no intent toward public or private, how could there be any attachment to the court?

【Pronunciation Notes】*Zhérán*: *dīng xié* reflex. *Zhérán*: the appearance of immobility. *Wú gōng cháo*: *zhí yáo* reflex. The commentary is the same.

【5】【Commentary】Matters external to one’s nature are gone.
【Exegesis】*Gǔ* means disorder. The mind concentrated on inner skill dispels external disturbances.
【Pronunciation Notes】*Gǔ xiāo*: read as written. Alternate text writes *gǔ xiāo* (滑消).

【6】【Commentary】One must select from among the finest materials.
【Exegesis】With external affairs dispelled and the inner mind emptied and stilled, one then enters the mountain forest to observe the natural dispositions of fine trees. Only when the form and appearance reach the utmost refinement, such that the wood is fit to become a *jù*, does one then set one’s hand to the work. If not, one stops and does not proceed.
【Pronunciation Notes】*Chéng jiàn*: *xián biàn* reflex.

《Cái zhōng》: *dīng zhòng* reflex.

【7】【Commentary】One must not depart from its natural state.
【Exegesis】Though human skill applies its ingenuity, the nature of the wood ever follows the natural, thus harmonizing with Heaven.

【8】【Commentary】Exhaustively following the marvel of the thing, it then seems as though wrought by spirits.
【Exegesis】That the subtlety of the *jù* appears as though crafted by spirits arises solely from following the heavenly nature and accord with the natural, thus achieving such perfection. This passage clarifies that following principle makes skill divine as spirits, while contrariness to nature labors the mind and makes one clumsy.

【Pronunciation Notes】《Shì yǔ》: read as *yú*.
【Collation Notes】(1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition writes *gǔ* as *huá*. (2) *Quē wù* cites the Jiangnan ancient manuscript as including *yóu* beneath *qí*. (3) Zhao’s edition omits *nǎi*. (4) The Shide Hall edition writes *yě* as *ěr*; Zhao’s edition omits it.

Dongye Ji presented his charioteering to Duke Zhuang. His advances and retreats aligned with the marking cord; his left and right turns matched the compass.
Duke Zhuang deemed even embroidery could not surpass it, and had him trace a hundred hooks before returning.

【1】【Exegesis】Dongye was the surname, Ji the given name—an adept charioteer of old who demonstrated his skill to Duke Zhuang of Lu. His left and right turns formed perfect circles; his advances and retreats followed straight lines. Duke Zhuang deemed even the finest woven patterns could not surpass such mastery.

(1) Sima Biao states: Xun Qing wrote *Dongye Bi*. (2) *Yǐ yù jiàn*: *xián* is read with the *fan* tone *biàn*; the same below. (3) *Zhuāng Gōng*: Li notes: "Duke Zhuang of Lu." Some say: "The Inner Chapters state that Yan He was to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei. Since he was not contemporary with Duke Zhuang of Lu, this must refer to Duke Zhuang of Wei." (4) Yu Yue remarks: "The *Aigong* chapter of the *Xunzi* records this event, with *Zhuang Gong* as *Ding Gong* and *Yan He* as *Yan Yuan*, thus referring to Duke Ding of Lu."

*Zhòng shéng*: *dīng zhòng* is read with the *fan* tone; the same below. (5) *Wén fú guò yě*: Sima Biao states: "Meaning it surpasses the patterns of woven and embroidered textiles."

【2】【Exegesis】As the horses turned, their path curved like a hook. After a hundred circuits, they retraced their tracks.
【*Shiwen*】Sima Biao states: "Ji, proud of his skill, drove in circles like a hook retracing its path, a hundred turns without cease."

Yan He encountered him and entered to see the duke, saying: "Ji’s horses are about to fail." The duke remained silent and did not respond.
【1】【Exegesis】Yan was the surname, He the given name—a worthy man of Lu who entered to see the duke. Duke Zhuang initially did not believe him, so he remained silent and did not reply.
【*Shiwen*】*Yán Hé*: *hù là* tone. The *Yuangjia* edition writes *tà*. Cui’s edition is the same.

Soon after, the horses indeed failed and returned. The duke asked: "How did you know?"
【1】【Exegesis】After a short while, the horses exhausted themselves and failed. The duke asked Yan how he had known.

He replied: "His horses’ strength was spent, yet he still demanded more of them—thus I knew they would fail."
【1】【Commentary】This illustrates the principle that the utmost cannot be exceeded.
【Exegesis】He answered: "The horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he demanded abilities beyond their capacity—thus I knew they would fail." This is not only true of chariots and horses but of all things. Even the craftsman Chui, though he turned his compass and covered his square, acted in harmony with things without mental deliberation. Thus his spirit-terrace was unified and unshackled.

Forget the feet, and the shoes fit;
Forget the waist, and the belt fits.
【3】【Commentary】When all parts of the body are at ease, one forgets the body entirely.
【*Shiwen*】*Zú jù*: *jiǔ zhù* tone. *Yāo dài*: *yī yáo* tone.

Know to forget right and wrong, and the mind is at ease.
【4】【Commentary】Right and wrong arise from disharmony.
【Exegesis】Shoes and belts exist for the feet and waist; once the feet and waist are forgotten, shoes and belts become comfortable. Likewise, the mind harbors sorrow and conflict due to right and wrong; once right and wrong are known and forgotten, the mind is always at ease.

No inner change, no outer compliance—this is the harmony of circumstances.
【5】【Commentary】One finds peace in what one encounters, thus there is no change or compliance.
【Exegesis】With outer wisdom still and the inner mind unmoved, the external world empty, one does not follow external affairs—thus one harmonizes with the true Dao and is always at ease.

From the beginning, one is at ease and never not at ease—this is the ease of forgetting ease.
【6】【Commentary】One who recognizes ease is not yet at ease.
【Exegesis】*Shǐ* means "origin." One who embodies the Dao is empty and forgetful, with an inherently constant ease—not joyful only after being moved by things, which would mean there are times of unease. This inherent constancy is always joyful, thus it is the ease of forgetting ease, not the ease of deliberate intent.

There was a man named Sun Xiu who, stepping to the gate, reproached Master Bian Qingzi, saying: "Though I dwell in my village and am not called unrefined, face peril and am not called cowardly—yet when tilling the fields I do not meet with the year’s harvest, when serving a lord I do not meet with the age’s favor. I am shunned in my village, driven from my district—what crime have I committed against Heaven? Why must I suffer this fate?"

Sun Xiu was a man of Lu, surnamed Sun, named Xiu.
【Exegesis】*Zhǒng* means "frequently." *Chà* means "to inform" or "to sigh." Unable to expound the Dao and resenting his adversity, he frequently came to the gate and sighed. Bian was his surname, and Qingzi his given name—a worthy man of Lu and Sun Xiu’s teacher. Sun Xiu, a worldly man who did not comprehend the mandate of Heaven, repeatedly came to the gate and said: "In my village, no one says I lack refinement; in the face of peril, no one says I lack courage. Yet when I till the fields on the plain, I meet with barren years and no harvest; when I serve at court to attend my lord, I do not encounter sagely rule nor secure a worthy office. I am exiled by the district and cast out by my village—what crime have I committed against Heaven that I should suffer such a fate?"

【Phonetic Gloss】
*Zhǒngmén*: *zhāng*, rhyming with 勇.
*Ér chà*: *chìjià*, also *hūjià*; Guo *dūjià*.
Sima: "to arrive."
Li’s edition reads 托, glossed as "to entrust."
*Zǐ Biǎn Qìngzǐ*: *piān*, also *fútiǎn*.
Li: "Bian is the surname; Qingzi the courtesy name."
*Línnàn*: *nǎidàn*.

Master Bian said: "Have you alone not heard of the conduct of the perfected person?"

"Forgetting their liver and gall, abandoning their ears and eyes, they wander in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roaming freely in the work of non-action—this is called acting without reliance, growing without dominion.

Now you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose the filthy, shining brightly as if bearing the sun and moon in your stride. You have preserved your whole bodily form, complete with the nine orifices, and have not halfway met an early end through deafness, blindness, lameness, or deformity to be counted among the ranks of men—this is already fortune enough. Why then do you have leisure to resent Heaven? Begone!"

---

"[Four] [Annotation] This is simply following one’s nature and acting spontaneously, not relying on effort to do so.

[Five] [Annotation] It grows of itself, not through any deliberate cultivation.

[Exegesis] In engaging with things and bestowing transformation, one does not rely on exhausting oneself; in nurturing the common people, how could one sever and appropriate for oneself! This accords with the ancient classics.

[Philological Notes] *Chang er* (長而): read *dìng zhàng* (丁丈反). The annotation is the same.

[Six] [Exegesis] You adorn your mind and intellect to startle the foolish and vulgar; you cultivate and tend to your bodily form to expose the filth of others. Shining brightly and plainly, you flaunt your abilities, as if bearing the sun and moon in stride through the world—how is this concealing one’s brilliance or veiling one’s radiance to nurture tranquility!

[Philological Notes] *Shi zhi* (飾知): read *zhì* (智). *Ming wu* (明污): read *wū* (乌). *Ruo jie* (若揭): read *qí liè* (其列反), or *qí yè* (其谒反).

[Seven] [Exegesis] *Er* (而) refers to you. You have preserved your bodily form whole, with the nine orifices intact, and have further avoided meeting an early end through deafness, blindness, lameness, or deformity. You have also been counted among the ranks of men—what greater fortune could there be than this? How then do you have leisure to resent the Way of Heaven? You should depart swiftly and spare further words."

[Philological Notes] *Jiu qiao* (九竅): read *kǔ diào* (苦吊反). *Bo* (跛): read *bō wǒ* (波我反). ◎Lu Wenchang notes: Formerly written as *bǐ wǒ* (彼我反), which was erroneous. Now corrected. *Jian* (蹇): read *jǐ niǎn* (紀辇反), or *jǐ yǎn* (紀偃反), or *xú qǐ yǎn* (徐其偃反). *Er bi* (而比): read as written (如字), or *pí zhì* (毗志反).

Sunzi departed. Bianzi entered, sat in leisure, and sighed toward the heavens.

[One] [Exegesis] Sun Qiu heard the Dao and left; Bianzi finished speaking and returned. In but a moment, he sighed in lament.

[Two] [Exegesis] Bianzi’s disciples asked the reason for his sigh.

Bianzi said, "Earlier, Qiu came, and I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person. I fear he was startled and may yet fall into confusion."

[One] [Exegesis] Sun Qiu repeatedly came to my door, complaining of his lot in life, troubled and discontent. I then told him of the profound and mysterious virtue of the perfected person. But his capacity is small, and my words were great—I worried that a leak in the mechanism might cause him distress, increasing his confusion. This is why I sighed."

The disciples said, "Not so. Were Sunzi’s words correct?"

"Was what the master spoke not correct? If it were truly incorrect, it could not have confused what is right. Was what Sunzi spoke not correct? Was what the master spoke correct? He was already confused when he came—what fault is his!"

[One] [Exegesis] If Sunzi’s words were correct and Master Bian’s words incorrect, then incorrect speech could not have confused what is right. If Master Bian’s words were correct and Sunzi’s incorrect, then he must have come seeking what is right precisely because he was confused. Examining the matter from both sides, what fault could there be? The master’s sigh was ultimately in vain.

[Variant] (One) Zhao Jianyi’s original text includes the character *zhe* 者 below.

Bianzi said, "Not so. Once, a bird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu delighted in it, preparing a grand feast to entertain it and performing the *Nine Shao* to please it. Yet the bird grew sorrowful, dizzy, and fearful, daring neither to eat nor drink. This is what it means to nourish a bird with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, drift upon rivers and lakes, and feed on whatever it encounters—then it would be at ease on level ground.

Now, Sun Qiu is a man of simple sincerity and limited understanding. When I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person, it was like burdening a mouse with chariots and horses or delighting a sparrow with bells and drums. How could he not be startled?"

---

**Note [1]:** Each has what suits it.
**Commentary:** This osprey is no auspicious omen; the Lord of Lu lavished rewards upon it, offering a grand feast of the finest meats—this matter was already made clear in the preceding passage, and there is no need for further explanation.

**Textual Notes:**
*"Delighted in it"* (說之): pronounced *yuè*.
*"Prepared"* (為具): pronounced *yú wěi*.
*"Performed the *Nine Shao*"* (奏九韶): the *Yuán Jiā* edition reads *"performed the *Shao* and *Wu*"*.
*"To please it"* (以樂): pronounced *yuè*; same below.
*"Feed it"* (食之): pronounced *sì*.
*"Whatever it encounters"* (委): pronounced *yú wēi*.
*"Serpent"* (蛇): read as written. Li [Yun] says: "The great bird swallows serpents." Sima [Biao] says: "*Weiyí* means mud."
◎ Yu Yue remarks: The nature of *weiyí* is unclear. Li says the great bird eats serpents, yet it is unheard of that one must feed serpents to birds. Sima says *weiyí* is mud—this, too, is mere conjecture. Now, in the *"Utmost Joy"* chapter, it is said: *"As for nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, wander upon level mounds, drift upon rivers and lakes, feed it as it moves in formation and rests—*weiyí* in its dwelling."* Thus, this passage should likewise read: *"feed it with... *weiyí* in its dwelling."* A lacuna in transmission has left the text incomplete. Moreover, only with *"in its dwelling"* does the phrasing align with the following clause *"then it would be at ease on level ground."* Without *"in its dwelling,"* the latter clause would lack coherence.

**Note [2]:** This chapter shows that those who skillfully nourish life each follow the suitability of their nature to reach perfection.
**Commentary:** *Xī* is a small mouse; *yàn* is a sparrow. Sun Qiu is a man of limited knowledge and narrow experience, requiring patient and gradual instruction. Yet I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person, of the profound and wondrous words of the great Dao—how is this different from burdening a tiny mouse with a great chariot or delighting a sparrow with the music of *Shao*? If one employs the grand where the small is fitting, how could he not be startled and fearful?

**Textual Notes:**
*"Simple sincerity"* (款启): Li [Yun] says: *"Kuǎn* means empty; *qǐ* means open—like an opening that reveals little."
*"Mouse"* (鼷): pronounced *xī*.
*"Sparrow"* (鴳): the character is also written as *鴳*, pronounced *yàn*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The present text writes *鴳*.

**Collation:** The *Quē Wù* edition, citing Liu Deyi’s version, includes the character *"ān"* (安) below.

**Chapter 20: "Mountain Trees"** *(Named after the opening event)*

As Zhuangzi walked through the mountains, he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. When asked why, he replied, "It is of no use." Zhuangzi said, "This tree, by virtue of its worthlessness, has fulfilled its natural lifespan."

**Commentary:** Like the tree that bent to fit the axle or the timber of Shangqiu, its lack of utility allowed it to complete its Heaven-appointed years.

**Textual Notes:**
*"In the mountains"* (山中): The *Shì Míng* says: "Mountain (*shān*) means to produce (*chǎn*), for it produces things." The *Shuō Wén* says: "Mountain (*shān*) means to disperse (*xuān*), for it disperses *qi* and generates the myriad things."
*"Great tree"* (大木): The *Shì Míng* says: "Tree (*mù*) means to cover (*mào*), for it covers the earth as it grows." The *Zì Lín* says: "Tree (*mù*) is the general term for all plants." The *Bái Hǔ Tōng* says: "Tree (*mù*) means to surge (*yǒng*)."

When Confucius emerged from the mountains, he lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, overjoyed, ordered his servant to kill a goose and prepare it.

The servant asked, "One can cackle, the other cannot—which should we kill?"
The host replied, "Kill the one that cannot cackle."

**Commentary:** *Lodged* means to rest. The servant addresses Zhuangzi as *"Master"* (*fūzǐ*).
**Textual Notes:**
*"Confucius"* (夫子): read as written. *Fū* refers to the Master, meaning Zhuangzi. Some versions write *"Master Confucius"* (*fūzǐ*).
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The present text writes *"Master Confucius emerged."*

**Commentary:** The disciples call Zhuangzi *"Master."* *Servant* refers to a young attendant.
**Textual Notes:**
*"Servant"* (竖): pronounced *shù*.
*"Prepare it"* (烹之): pronounced *pēng*, meaning to boil.
◎ Wang Niansun remarks: I suspect this *hēng* should be read as *xiǎng* (to offer). *"Xiǎng zhī"* means to offer it to Zhuangzi. The old friend rejoiced at Zhuangzi’s arrival, so he killed a goose to offer him. *Xiǎng* and *xiǎng* (feast) are interchangeable. The *Lǚ Shì Chūn Qiū*’s *"Bì Jǐ"* chapter reads: *"Order the servant to kill a goose and feast him,"* which serves as evidence. In ancient texts, *xiǎng* was written as *hēng*, and *pēng* was also written as *hēng*, so the *Textual Notes* mistakenly read it as *pēng*, and later editions altered *hēng* to *pēng*.
*(The original text writes *hēng*, hence the *Textual Notes* gloss it as *pǔ pēng*. If it were *pēng*, no gloss would be needed.)*
◎ Qingfan notes: *Goose* (*yàn*) is the *é* (鹅). The *Shuō Wén* says: *"É (鹅) is the □é (□鹅)."* *"Yàn (雁) is the é (鹅)."* The *Ěr Yǎ*’s *"Shū Yàn"* says: *"The domesticated goose is the é,"* with the note: *"Now in Jiangdong, it is called □."* The *Fāng Yán* says: *"Goose, east of the Pass, is called □é; beyond southern Chu, it is called é."* The *Guǎng Yǎ* says: *"□é is the yàn."*

**Collation:** *É (鹅)* is the *□é (□鹅)*. Emended according to the original *Shuō Wén*.

---

The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi, "Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by virtue of its worthlessness, fulfilled its natural lifespan. Today, our host’s goose, by virtue of its worthlessness, met its death. Master, where will you stand?"

Zhuangzi laughed and said, "I would stand between the useful and the useless. Yet to stand between the useful and the useless—though it may seem so—is not the true Way, and thus one remains entangled in care.

Now, if one rides the Dao and its virtue, drifting freely, it is otherwise. Without praise, without blame, now a dragon, now a serpent, one transforms with the times and refuses to cling to any single form. Rising and falling, one takes harmony as the measure, drifting upon the Ancestor of the Myriad Things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be ensnared?

This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor. As for the nature of the myriad things and the traditions of human relations, it is not so. Union invites separation, completion invites destruction; sharpness invites blunting, honor invites criticism; action invites loss, worth invites scheming, worthlessness invites deceit—how can one ever be certain?

Alas! Remember this, my disciples: it is only in the realm of the Dao and its virtue!"*

---
*Annotation (as per original text):
[1] One might suppose this to be the proper stance, yet even here one is not free from care, and so in the end, it is not where one should stand.

The *Commentary* states: "Having talent" means engaging in action; "lacking talent" means practicing non-action. Between these lies the "middle Way." Though one may depart from these two extremes and abide in this singular middle, since the middle itself has not yet been transcended, one remains like a person unable to govern others, or a wild goose unable to flock with its kind—thus resembling the Dao without being the true Dao, still subject to these cares and burdens.

The *Commentary* further states: Those who ride the mysterious Dao and supreme virtue to drift through the world do not act thus. Having transcended the two extremes and forgotten the singular middle, they can empty themselves and drift through the ages.

The *Commentary* explains: *Zi* means "to slander," *long* means "to emerge," and *she* means "to dwell." The Dao is neither talented nor untalented, so all praise and blame lose their hold.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Wuyu* ("without praise") is pronounced *yu*; *wuzi* ("without slander") is pronounced *zi* (or *ci*, according to Xu).

The *Commentary* states: This is the transcendence of the middle. Having transcended the two extremes and forgotten the singular middle, one transcends again and again, deepening into mystery upon mystery.

The *Commentary* continues: Once the singular middle is sublimely transcended and the four propositions are left far behind, how could one still be swayed by flattery or slander, or bewildered by emergence or dwelling? Thus, one drifts with the world, transforming in accord with the times—how could one cling to partiality and become fixed as a single thing?

The *Commentary* states: The perfected person can rise and fall with the times, taking harmony as their measure.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Yishang* ("one rise") is pronounced as written, or *shizhang*; *weiliang* ("as measure") is pronounced *liang*. ◎ Yu Yue notes: This originally read "one fall, one rise, taking harmony as measure," with *shang* ("rise") rhyming with *liang* ("measure"). Now it reads "one rise, one fall," losing the rhyme. Ancient texts often invert word order for rhyme, and later scholars, unaware, have altered many such passages. In the "Autumn Floods" chapter, "without east, without west" originally read "without west, without east" to rhyme with *tong* ("pervade"), but was later changed. The original text of *Zhuangzi* must have been so.

The *Commentary* states: With great harmony as their equal measure, they wander to the Ancestor of the Myriad Things.

The *Commentary* states: When things do not treat one another as things, there is no sorrow or harm.

The *Annotation* states: Thus, Zhuangzi also abides here.

The *Commentary* states: Guo's annotation says, "Thus, Zhuangzi also abides here."

The *Commentary* explains: *Lun* means "principle." Following the transmitted customs of the common world does not compare to the foregoing.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Ren lun zhi zhuan* ("traditions of human relations") is pronounced *zhi zhuan*. Sima Biao says: "Matters of a kind that can be transmitted and practiced."

The *Commentary* states: Union invites separation, completion invites destruction; purity invites injury, honor invites doubt. The ways of the world are perilous—how can one be certain? Moreover: purity wounds others, and when others cannot endure its influence, they strike back. When one exalts oneself above others, and others cannot bear the humiliation, they respond with doubt.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Zecuo* ("then blunted") is pronounced *ziwo*. Some versions write *cuo* ("to injure"), which is the same. ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current text writes *cuo* ("to injure"). ◎ Qing Fan observes: *Cuo* should be *cuo* ("to file"), as the current text writes *cuo* ("to injure"), a later alteration. The *Shuowen* states: *Cuo* means "to break or wound." Gao You's commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu* ("Must Be") says: *Cuo* means "to damage or injure." Gao You's commentary on the *Huainanzi* ("Cultivating Effort") says: *Dun bing cuo rui* ("to blunt weapons and injure their edge")—*cuo* means "to break or humiliate." (This is also a later alteration.) *Cuo* ("to file") does not mean "to injure." The current text's *cuo* ("to injure") is incorrect. ◎ Yu Yue notes: *Yi* ("doubt") should be read as *e* ("to incline"). The *Book of Songs* ("First Banquet at the Ancestral Temple") says: *Ce bian zhi e* ("the tilted caps incline"), where Zheng Xuan's commentary states: *E* means "to lean." *Zun ze e* ("honor invites inclining") means that loftiness must topple. In ancient texts, *e* is sometimes written as *yi* ("doubt"), as seen in the *Guanzi* ("Laws and Prohibitions"): *Fa zhi bu yi, ze min bu xiang si* ("If laws and institutions are not inclined, the people will not favor one another")—*yi* means *e* ("to incline"), meaning that if laws and institutions are not partial, the people will not act selfishly. It is also sometimes written as *yi* ("ritual"), as in the *Xunzi* ("Composing the Odes"): *Jun fa yi, jin bu wei* ("If the ruler's laws and rituals incline, they must be prohibited")—*yi* means *e* ("to incline"), meaning that if the ruler's laws incline, they must be prohibited to prevent such conduct.

The *Commentary* states: *Kui* ("loss") means "to diminish"—action invites loss. The worthy, with their lofty aspirations, are schemed against by others.

The *Commentary* states: Why must one act in accord with worthiness or worthlessness? Certainty leads to partiality and attachment to names, which is why there is completion and loss. ◎ Jia Shifu notes: Riding the Dao and virtue to drift is to transcend the world; the nature of the myriad things and the traditions of human relations are for those who enter the world with their bodies. Union and separation, completion and destruction, are mutually dependent; purity and injury, honor and doubt, action and loss, are mutually entailed; worthiness invites scheming, worthlessness invites deceit—each dazzles the other. That which cannot be certain is the unknown origin of fortune and misfortune, life and death. Purity invites injury, for the towering is easily broken; honor invites doubt, for the highest position is perilous; action invites loss, for suspicion of the outstanding is the common attitude. The old annotations miss this.

The *Commentary* states: *Beifu* ("Alas!") is an exclamation. *Zhi* means "to remember."

The *Annotation* states: Since nothing can be certain, one cannot rely on a single approach. Only those who transform with the times can traverse change and remain perpetually unobstructed.

The *Commentary* states: Those who employ the principle of the balanced middle abide in the realm of the Dao and its virtue.

The *Exegesis* reads: *Zhi xiang* ("the realm") is pronounced as written, or *xu liang*.

The *Collation* notes: (1) The Zhao Jianyi edition does not repeat this sentence. (2) The character *Xu* is amended according to the Shidetang edition.

Shi Nanyou of the South Market met with the Lord of Lu, who wore a look of sorrow.

Shi Nanyou said, "My lord bears a look of sorrow—why is this?"

**Annotation:** His surname was Xiong, given name Yiliao, and he lived in reclusion south of the market.

**Exegesis:** *Shinan Yiliao* (市南宜僚): pronounced *Liǎoxiāo* in some readings, or *Lìyáo* in Xu’s recension. Sima Biao notes: "Xiong Yiliao, who dwelt south of the market, whence his sobriquet." Li notes: "Surname Xiong, given name Yiliao." The *Zuozhuan* records: "South of the market there was Xiong Yiliao, a man of Chu." ◎ Yu Yue observes: The commentary to the *Huainanzi*’s "Mastery of Governance" chapter states: "Yiliao was his surname, Xiong his given name." It is likely that the characters for surname and given name were mistakenly transposed.

The Lord of Lu replied, "I have studied the Dao of the former kings and cultivated the undertakings of my predecessors. I revere the spirits and honor the worthy, embracing and enacting these principles without the slightest lapse. Yet I cannot escape misfortune—this is why I grieve."

**Annotation:** The former kings refer to King Ji and King Wen; the former lords, to the Duke of Zhou and Bo Qin.

**Annotation:** *Li* (離) means "to disperse"; *ju* (居), "to dwell in ease."

**Exegesis:** *Wu xuyu li* (無須臾離): *li* pronounced *lìzhì*. Treated as a complete phrase. Cui’s edition omits the character *li*. *Juran* (居然): In Cui’s reading, *ju* is linked to the preceding phrase. ◎ Yu Yue observes: Cui’s edition omits *li* and links *ju* to the preceding phrase—this should be followed. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s "Caution in Conduct" chapter reads *piánzhī bù jū* (胼胝不居), where Gao You glosses *ju* as "to halt." *Wu xuyu ju* means "without the slightest halt," directly opposing the preceding *xing* (行, "to enact"). Scholars, failing to grasp the sense of *ju*, and misled by the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s phrase "cannot be departed from for even a moment," have erroneously added *li* and linked *ju* to the following phrase, thus missing the point. Below, the text reads *ju de xing er bu ming chu* (居得行而不名處), where *ju* and *xing* are again paired. Guo’s commentary—"dwelling in ease, naturally attaining this practice"—is incorrect.

**Collation:** (1) Originally misplaced in the following section; now corrected.

Shi Nanyou said, "My lord’s method for dispelling misfortune is too shallow! Consider the richly patterned fox and the clouded leopard: they dwell in mountain forests, crouch in rocky caves—this is stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance. Though hunger and thirst press them, they still roam the rivers and lakes in search of sustenance—this is steadfastness. Yet even so, they cannot escape the snares and traps that ensnare them. What crime have they committed?"

The disaster lies in their pelts. Now, is not the state of Lu alone your pelt? I wish for you to carve away your form and shed your pelt, to cleanse your heart and cast off desire, and wander in the wilds where no one dwells. In the southern lands of Yue, there is a settlement called the Land of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unrefined, with little selfishness and few desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where duty leads, nor where ritual conducts. Wild and unrestrained, they yet tread the Great Dao. Their lives are joyful, and their deaths may be buried. I wish for you to leave your state, abandon custom, and walk in mutual support with the Dao.”

“《可乐》 is pronounced as *luò*. [12] **Commentary:** What is called "leaving the state and abandoning custom" refers to purging one’s heart. **Subcommentary:** *捐* means to discard. To abandon custom is to walk in mutual support with the Dao of effortless action.

The ruler said, “That Way is distant and perilous, and there are rivers and mountains in between. I have no boats or carriages—what is to be done?” [1] **Commentary:** Truly, this is to urge him to go south to Yue. **Subcommentary:** Delusion and awakening differ in nature, hence the separation between Lu and Yue.

Master Shinan said, “Let Your Lordship not be haughty in form or linger in residence, and I shall make a carriage for you.” [1] **Commentary:** *形倨* means to stumble and be hindered. **Subcommentary:** Do not rely on lofty status or display arrogance in bearing. **Philological Notes:** *无形倨* is pronounced *wú xíng jù*. Sima [Biao] says: “Do not be haughty in form.” *踬* is pronounced *zhì* (also *zhǐ*). *碍* is pronounced *ài*. [2] **Commentary:** *留居* means to stagnate and cling. **Subcommentary:** Follow things as they move, without attachment to glory. **Philological Notes:** *无留居*: Sima [Biao] says: “Do not linger in comfort at one’s residence.” [3] **Commentary:** When form is level with things and the heart transforms with them, one may entrust oneself to things for conveyance.

The ruler said, “That Way is secluded and distant, with no people—with whom shall I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?” [1] **Subcommentary:** Not yet having grasped solitary transformation, he cannot forget things. **Philological Notes:** *我无食*: One version reads *饿* instead of *我*.

Master Shinan said, “Reduce your Lordship’s expenses and diminish your desires, and though you have no provisions, you will yet have enough. [1] **Commentary:** This is what is meant by ‘knowing contentment, there is nothing that is not sufficient.’ **Subcommentary:** The Dao does not rely on things to be complete but is simply serene and indifferent. Let Your Lordship cross the river and float upon the sea. [2] **Subcommentary:** The *river* refers to wisdom; the *sea*, to the Dao. Cross the river of supreme goodness and wander the sea of the Great Dao. Gaze upon it, and you will not see its shores; the farther you go, the more you will not know its end. [3] **Commentary:** This is the remoteness of cutting off passions and desires. **Subcommentary:** How could one know its limit? Those who see you off will all turn back from the shore, and from this point, Your Lordship will be far away. [4] **Commentary:** When the ruler desires to depart, the people each return to guard their proper places. **Subcommentary:** As they see the ruler off on his journey to the realm of the Dao, the people return to their true nature and guard their original roles. *崖* means *boundary*. [5] **Commentary:** To stand transcendent and independent above the myriad things. **Subcommentary:** *自* means *from*. From this, the ruler’s feelings will be lofty, and his Dao and virtue profoundly distant.

Those who possess others become encumbered; those who are possessed by others become anxious. [6] **Commentary:** *有人者* means to possess them as one’s private property. **Subcommentary:** Ruling the state of Lu, with its abundant wealth and people, and claiming them as one’s own, deeply becomes a burden. [7] **Commentary:** *见有于人者* means to be employed and used by others. **Subcommentary:** Not yet having forgotten Lu, being possessed by others, he reveres ghosts, honors the worthy, pities the people, and toils for them—is this not anxiety? Thus, Yao neither possessed others nor was possessed by them. [8] **Commentary:** Though he had the world, he entrusted it to the hundred officials and committed it to the myriad things without partaking in it—this is not possessing others. Following the people and entrusting things without being employed by them—this is not being possessed by others. **Subcommentary:** As Guo’s commentary says: “Though he had the world, he entrusted it to the hundred officials and committed it to the myriad things without partaking in it—this is not possessing others. Following the people and entrusting things without being employed by them—this is not being possessed by others.” **Philological Notes:** *不与* is pronounced *bù yǔ*.

I wish to remove Your Lordship’s encumbrances and dispel your anxieties, that you may wander alone with the Dao in the land of the Great Vastness. [9] **Commentary:** This is to urge him to be utterly free of attachment to his state. **Subcommentary:** *大莫* means *great nothingness*—no one in the world can disturb it. **Philological Notes:** *大莫*: *莫* means *nothingness*.

When two boats are lashed together to cross the river, [10] **Subcommentary:** Two boats joined side by side are called *方舟*. **Philological Notes:** *方舟*: Sima [Biao] says: “*方* means *joined*.” if an empty boat comes and strikes them, even a man of narrow temper will not grow angry. [11] **Subcommentary:** *褊* means *narrow and impatient*. He does not grow angry because the boat is empty. **Philological Notes:** *惼心* is pronounced *biǎn xīn*. The *Erya* says: “impatient.” But if there is a man aboard, he will shout to make him open and close [his course]. If he shouts once and is not heard, and shouts again and is still not heard, then on the third shout, he will surely follow with angry words. [12] **Subcommentary:** *恶声* means *abusive language*. **Philological Notes:** *则呼* is pronounced *zé hū* (and similarly below). *张歙*: *xū* is pronounced *xū jí* (Xu says *xǔ zhé*; Guo’s subcommentary says *shè*). *张* means *to open*; *歙* means *to close*. Formerly he did not grow angry, but now he does; formerly the boat was empty, but now it is full. If a man can empty himself and wander through the world, who can harm him?” [13] **Commentary:** Though the world changes, in emptying oneself to avoid harm, it is one and the same.

The *Subcommentary* states: "Emptying oneself" means having no mind.

**Textual Note:** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition has *biān* (褊) for *biǎn* (惼).

Now, Beigong She [1] levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells. He built an altar outside the outer gate of the capital, [2] and in three months completed the upper and lower chimes. [3]

[1] *Subcommentary:* His surname was Beigong, his given name She. He lived in the Northern Palace, hence his surname. He was a grandee of Wei.
*Philological Notes:* Beigong She—Li [Yi] says: a grandee of Wei who lived in the Northern Palace, hence his designation. *She* was his given name.

[2] *Subcommentary:* Bells are the name of a musical instrument. To cast bells, one must first perform a sacrifice, hence the altar.
*Philological Notes:* "For Wei"—pronounced *yú wěi*. "Levied taxes"—pronounced *lì yàn*. "Built an altar"—pronounced *wéi tán*. Li [Yi] says: a sacrifice; one prays, hence the altar.

[3] *Subcommentary:* When the upper and lower tones are tuned, the eight sounds are complete, hence "chimes."
*Philological Notes:* "Upper and lower chimes"—pronounced *shàng xià zhī xuán*. Sima [Biao] says: the eight sounds are complete, forming chimes with high and low pitches.

Prince Qingji of Wang saw this and asked, “What method have you employed?” [1]

[1] *Subcommentary:* Qingji was a son of the Zhou king and a grandee of Zhou. Seeing the exquisite bell-altar, he marveled and asked.
*Philological Notes:* Prince Qingji of Wang—Li [Yi] says: a royal clansman. Qingji was a grandee of Zhou. Marveling at the swift simplicity, he asked.
◎ Yu Yue says: The *Commentary on the Lunyu* states that Wangsun Jia was a grandson of King Ling of Zhou, named Jia, and served as a grandee in Wei at that time. Thus, this Prince Qingji of Wang was likely also a prince of Zhou who served in Wei. Qi also had Prince Chengfu, as seen in the *Zuozhuan* under the eleventh year of Duke Wen.

She replied, “In the interval of unity, I dared not employ any method. [1] I have heard: ‘Once carved, once polished, return to simplicity.’ [2] Vast and without knowledge, [3] carefree and hesitant; [4] gathering in boundless obscurity, sending off the departing and welcoming the arriving; [5] those who come are not forbidden, those who go are not stopped; [6] follow their strength, [7] comply with their crookedness, [8] rely on their self-exhaustion, [9] thus morning and evening levying taxes yet not the slightest harm is done. [10] How much more so for those on the great path!” [11]

[1] *Commentary:* He simply embraced unity, not daring to impose methods to complicate matters.
*Subcommentary:* Guo’s commentary states: He simply embraced unity, not daring to impose methods to complicate matters.
*Philological Notes:* "Simply"—pronounced *bó rán*.

[2] *Commentary:* Return to one’s original nature.
*Subcommentary:* Guo’s commentary states: Return to one’s original nature.

[3] *Commentary:* Let it be in its pure simplicity.
*Subcommentary:* "Vast"—the appearance of having no feelings. Let it be in its pure simplicity.
*Philological Notes:* "Vast"—pronounced *tóng hū* (alternate readings: *tǔ gōng*, *chì dòng*; appearance of ignorance). The *Zilin* says: appearance of greatness. Also pronounced *tòng*.

[4] *Commentary:* Without direction.
*Subcommentary:* "Carefree"—without concern. "Hesitant"—retreating. All matters of doubtful deliberation have departed.
*Philological Notes:* "Carefree"—pronounced *tǎng*.

[5] *Commentary:* Without delight.
*Subcommentary:* "Gathering"—to assemble. Things assemble in boundless obscurity; their coming and going are neither welcomed nor sent off—this is letting things be. Alternatively: in dim confusion, the mind has no certainty, following their welcoming and sending, letting things come and go.
*Philological Notes:* "Gathering"—pronounced *cuì hū*. "Boundless"—pronounced *máng hū*. "Delight"—pronounced *xīn yuè*.

[6] *Commentary:* Let them be.
*Subcommentary:* The people welcome those who come without prohibition and do not detain those who depart.

[7] *Commentary:* Comply with the multitude.
*Philological Notes:* "Strength"—great power.

[8] *Commentary:* Without attachment.
*Subcommentary:* *Zhuàn*—pronounced *zhāng liàn*. Those who are strong and difficult to tax are followed and allowed; those who are crooked in human feelings are complied with and followed.
*Philological Notes:* "Crooked"—pronounced *qū fù*. Sima [Biao] says: those who crookedly attach to oneself are followed. Originally written as *zhuàn*, pronounced *zhāng liàn*.

[9] *Commentary:* Use their inevitability.
*Subcommentary:* Let the people each exhaust their own circumstances.
◎ Jia Shifu says: Levying taxes to cast bells is like the *Zuozhuan* under the twenty-ninth year of Duke Zhao, where the state of Jin was taxed one drum of iron to cast penal tripods—it was called levying taxes but allowed the people to contribute of their own accord, hence "rely on their self-exhaustion." The *Shuowen* says: "Exhaustion" means extremity. It means exhausting all they possess to contribute. Only by not daring to employ methods to seek but purely following nature did the people respond naturally. Today’s levies employ many methods, yet none can prevent the people’s clever evasion of them! Hence it is said: "Once carved, once polished, return to simplicity."

[10] *Commentary:* As before, without harm.
*Subcommentary:* Though taxes were levied, there was no coercion; each followed their nature, hence no harm was done.
*Philological Notes:* "Not harmed"—pronounced *bù cuò*.

[11] *Commentary:* Being at ease without attachment, using the world’s self-direction—this is the great path of thoroughfare. Hence it is said: "Plan it, manage it, and it is accomplished without a day’s effort."

The *Subcommentary* states: "Thoroughfare" means the Dao. Directly allowing things to take their course, without harm to oneself—how much more so when drawing upon the great Dao, where spiritual transformation operates through non-action! It is accomplished in three months—what is strange about this?

*Collation Notes:*
(1) The character *fu* (傅) is amended following the *Shiwen* and the *Shide Tang* edition.
(2) In the Zhao Jianyi edition, *hao* (毫) is written as *hao* (豪).

Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food.

*[1]* *Subcommentary:* King Zhao of Chu summoned Confucius, who traveled from Lu to Chu, passing between the states of Chen and Cai. As the Master’s retinue was large, the people of Chen and Cai mistook him for Yang Hu and thus raised troops to surround him. His disciples suffered from hunger, going seven days without cooked food, pressed to the point of extreme hardship.

Taigong Ren went to offer his condolences, saying: "Were you near death?"
Confucius replied: "Yes."
"Did you detest death?"
Confucius replied: "Yes."

*[1]* *Commentary:* He merely aligned himself with common likes and dislikes; the sage has no likes or dislikes.

*Subcommentary:* *Taigong* is an honorific for elders. *Ren* is his given name. *Ji* means "near." *Ran* means "thus." After Confucius was besieged, Taigong came to offer condolences and asked: "Were you near death?" He answered: "Thus." Taigong then asked: "Did you detest it?" He answered: "Thus."

**Phonetic Glosses:**
*"Da"* is read as *Tai*. *"Gong Ren"* is read as written. Li [Yun] says: *"Da gong"* is a title for high officials; *Ren* is his given name. ◎ Yu Yue notes: The *Guangyun* (1: dong) glosses the character *gong*: *"The* Shiben *records a* Da Gong □ Shu." *Thus, "Da gong" is a compound surname, not a title for officials.* *"Zi ji"* is read as *qi*, also as *ji*. *"Zi wu"* is read with the *wu* in *wulu* (反切: *wu-lu*). The same applies to the annotation below. *"Yu hao"* is read with the *hao* in *huba* (反切: *hu-bao*). The same applies throughout the chapter.

**Textual Note:**
The Zhao Jianyi edition omits the six characters *"Zi wu si hu? Yue: Ran."*

Taigong Ren said: "I have spoken before of the Way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird—its name is *Yidai*. As a bird, it is *fenfen-zhizhi*, appearing incapable. It takes flight only with support, and roosts only when pressed close to others. It dares not advance to the front nor retreat to the rear. It dares not eat first but must take the remnants. Thus, it is never singled out in formation, and outsiders never succeed in harming it, so it escapes calamity. The straightest trees are felled first; the sweetest wells run dry first. You, I suspect, adorn your wisdom to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose filth, and stride forth as conspicuously as if bearing the sun and moon—how could you escape harm? Long ago, I heard the Perfect One say: *'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who complete merit collapse; those who achieve fame suffer loss.'* Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common fold? The Dao flows but does not shine; it dwells in attainment yet does not claim a place. Pure and constant, it resembles madness. Erasing traces and relinquishing power, it does not pursue merit or fame. Thus, it bears no blame from others, and others bear none from it. The Utmost Person remains unknown—why do you delight in this?"

**Annotations:**
1. *Both expansive and unhurried, yet its mind is free of fixed attachments.*
2. *Always at ease, abiding in the mean.*

14. *Thus, it bears no blame from others, and others bear none from it.*
15. *The Utmost Person remains unknown—why do you delight in this?*

**Subcommentary:**
To illustrate the Way of longevity, he cites the sea bird as an analogy. *Fenfen-zhizhi* describes its slow, unsteady flight, incapable of soaring high. When flying, it must rely on companions and dares not take the lead; when roosting, it folds its wings tightly, pressed among the flock. ◎ *Fenfen* is read as *fen*; the character may also be written as *□*. *Zhizhi* is read as *zhi* (Xu reads *zu*); the character may also be written as *□*. Sima [Biao] says: *Fenfen-zhizhi* means leisurely and unhurried; another says: it describes low flight. Li [Yi] says: it refers to the sound of wings. *Pressed close to roost*: It dares not roost alone but huddles among the flock, barely finding space to perch—such is its extreme avoidance of harm. ◎ *Advancing not to the front, retreating not to the rear*: Always at ease, abiding in the mean. ◎ *Food not dared to be tasted first*: It merely follows things as they are. ◎ *Advancing and retreating in moderation* is the height of harm-avoidance; *eating and pecking in order* means it must follow the sequence. ◎ *Its remnants*: *Xu* means sequence. ◎ Wang Niansun says: The *Shiwen* states: *Xu* means sequence. This is incorrect. *Xu* means remainder—it dares not eat first but takes only what is left. The *Rangwang* chapter says: *"Its remnants are used for the state."* Sima Biao says: *Xu* means residue, i.e., what remains. The *Jiuzhang* of the *Chuci* says: *"The lingering winds of autumn and winter."* Wang Yi’s annotation: *Xu* means remainder. The *Dizi Zhi* chapter of the *Guanzi* says: *"Offer it as remnants."* Yin Zhichang says: *Xu* refers to candle stubs—stubs are also remnants. (See *Fangyan* and *Guangya*.)

◎ **4** ◎ *Annotation*: It moves with the flock.
◎ *Shiwen*: *Xinglie* (行列): *hùgāng* (户刚) *fǎn* (反). Below, *luanxing* (乱行) is the same. ◎ *Bùchì* (不斥): *chǐ* (尺).

◎ **5** ◎ *Annotation*: Harm and danger arise from employing knowledge in restless striving.
◎ *Exegesis*: By its humility and gentleness, it does not contend with things, so the flock of birds keeps to its ranks, and none is singled out or cast aside. Outsiders, in their haste, cannot harm it—thus it escapes the calamities of the human world.
◎ *Shiwen*: *Zúbù* (卒不): *zǐxù* (子恤) *fǎn* (反), meaning "in the end." ◎ Also *qīhū* (七忽) *fǎn* (反).

◎ **6** ◎ *Annotation*: This is the harm of talent.
◎ *Exegesis*: The straightest trees, being useful, are the first felled; the sweetest wells, being drawn from, are the first to run dry. Those who flaunt talent and wit meet the same fate.

◎ **7** ◎ *Annotation*: To scrutinize minor differences is to set oneself against the multitude; to merge in great sameness is to have no singularity in the world. Thus, what shines brightly is but the trace of what is profoundly obscure. Seeking to convey meaning through words and leave traces behind, he therefore took refuge in Chen and Cai to express his *intent*.
◎ *Exegesis*: This refers to Confucius, whose intent lay in adorning talent and wit to astonish the vulgar, polishing his person and mind to outshine others’ defilement, and displaying his brilliance to dazzle with his abilities.

Just as one who marches bearing the sun and moon aloft cannot escape calamity.

◎ *Exegesis*: Those who, like the great Sages, possess vast virtue and boundless power, giving life to all things, are called "greatly perfected." To fell is to take; to cast down is to ruin. Those who take credit for their abilities achieve no merit, while those who do not withdraw after success are sure to fall. Those whose fame shines brightly, unless they conceal their brilliance, will meet with disgrace.

◎ **9** ◎ *Annotation*: Merit is achieved through the many, so it is returned to them.
◎ *Exegesis*: Who can establish great merit, build towering renown, yet not claim it as their own, but instead attribute it to others? Only the Sage!

◎ **10** ◎ *Annotation*: It moves of itself, dimly and without ostentation.
◎ *Exegesis*: The Dao and virtue flow and fill the world, yet they conceal their brilliance, hence they are called "unilluminated."

◎ **11** ◎ *Annotation*: They all naturally attain this conduct, not by seeking fame before embracing it.
◎ *Exegesis*: Though one’s person is imbued with the Dao and virtue, flourishing in the world, they hide their name and obscure their traces, hence they do not dwell in fame.

◎ **12** ◎ *Annotation*: It moves without intention.
◎ *Exegesis*: "Pure and plain" refers to unadorned nature; "constant and unchanging" refers to blending with things. Without self-aggrandizement, one resembles a madman.

◎ **13** ◎ *Annotation*: Merit is achieved by others, so power does not reside in oneself, and name and traces vanish.
◎ *Exegesis*: Erasing sagely traces, relinquishing authority—how could one cling to merit or dwell on reputation?

◎ **14** ◎ *Annotation*: Following one’s nature and yielding to others, each bears their own responsibility.
◎ *Exegesis*: For this reason, one has no reputation. Since I do not reproach others, they in turn bear no blame toward me.

◎ **15** ◎ *Annotation*: Serene and without attachment, such is the perfected person.
◎ *Exegesis*: The person of utmost virtue does not display themselves in the world. You are sagely and wise—why then delight in fame?

Confucius said, "Excellent!" He then severed ties with his acquaintances, parted from his disciples, and fled to the great marsh. Clad in coarse cloth and deerskin, he ate wild fruits and acorns. Entering among beasts, he did not disrupt their herds; entering among birds, he did not disturb their flocks. Birds and beasts felt no aversion—how much less would humans!

◎ **1** ◎ *Annotation*: He adopted what others had discarded.
◎ *Exegesis*: Having received this admonition, Confucius found it excellent. He then withdrew from his social circles, left his disciples, dissolved his followers, and fled alone into the mountains and marshes. He exchanged his scholar’s robes for coarse cloth and deerskin, and forsook rich foods to eat wild fruits and acorns.

◎ **2** ◎ *Annotation*: Like plants and trees, without intention, they were not feared by birds and beasts.
◎ **3** ◎ *Annotation*: This is an allegory to illustrate the utmost sincerity and trust, moving with things yet remaining beyond harm.

◎ *Exegesis*: Like dead ashes, serene and still; like plants and trees, without emotion—birds and beasts were not startled, so how could humans feel aversion?

Confucius asked Zisang Hu, "I was twice banished from Lu, had a tree felled over me in Song, was forced to erase my traces in Wei, was impoverished in Shang and Zhou, and was besieged between Chen and Cai. I have endured these many hardships, yet my close associates have grown more distant, and my disciples and friends have scattered. Why is this?"

Confucius served as Minister of Justice in Lu. When the people of Qi heard of this, they selected female musicians and fine horses adorned with patterned trappings to gift to the Lord of Lu, sowing discord between him and Confucius, who was thus banished. Song was a successor state to Yin. Confucius, having been in Song and Zhou, was not employed, hence the term "impoverished." Facing these trials, his kinsmen and close associates grew ever more distant, while his disciples and friends became ever more scattered. Why should this be so?

*Annotation*: In *Zisang Hu*, *Hu* is pronounced *hù*. An alternate character is □, pronounced *yú*. Li [Yun] says: *Sang* is the surname; □ is his given name; he was a recluse. Some say: his surname was *Zisang Hu*, and his given name was *Yin*. Yu Yue remarks: This may be the *Zisang Hu* from *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. Since *Hu* is pronounced *hù*, it is identical to *Zisang Hu*. The alternate character □ is *yu*, the same as *雩* in *Shuowen*, which notes that *雩* may also be written as □. I believe that *Caisang Yu* in *The Table of Ancient and Modern Personages* is *Zisang Hu*, as discussed in the *Great and Venerable Teacher* chapter. *Yu* may be a corrupted form of □. In *Had a Tree Felled Over Me in Song*, one version reads *had a tree felled over me in Song, was forced to erase my traces in Wei*. Lu Wenchang says: The current text has *Wei* as *Song*; Lu [Deming] states that the following sentence’s *Song* and *Wei* should be transposed. In *These Many*, the emphasis is inverted. *Why Is This* is pronounced *yú*; the same applies below.

*Collation*: (1) The *Zhaojiangyi* edition has *Hu* as *Yu*; the *Shidetang* edition has it as *Hū*.

Zisang Hu said: "Have you alone not heard of the escape of the man on loan? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces, carried a child on his back, and fled. Someone asked: 'Was it for the sake of wealth? The child’s wealth is meager. Was it for the sake of burden? The child’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a child and flee?' Lin Hui replied: 'That was bound by profit; this is joined by Heaven. Those bound by profit abandon one another when pressed by poverty, misfortune, and harm; those joined by Heaven gather together when pressed by poverty, misfortune, and harm. The distance between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble person is bland as water; the friendship of the petty person is sweet as sweet wine. The noble person’s blandness draws close; the petty person’s sweetness severs. Those who unite without cause will part without cause.'"

The annotations clarify: "布" refers to wealth and silk. *Jie* (《假》) is pronounced *jiǎ* (古雅反). Li [Yi] says: it is a state’s name. ◎Qing Fan notes: *Wen Xuan*’s annotation to Wang Zhongbao’s "Chu Yuan Stele Inscription" cites Sima [Biao]’s commentary: "Jie is the name of a state." The *Shiwen* omits this. *Lin Hui* (《林回》): Sima [Biao] says: he was a fugitive from Yin. ◎Qing Fan notes: *Wen Xuan*’s annotation to Liu Xiaobiao’s "Guang Juejiao Lun" cites Sima [Biao]’s commentary: "Lin Hui is a person’s name." This differs slightly from the *Shiwen*. ◎Yu Yue says: In the preceding text, "the people of Jie fled," and Li’s annotation states: "Jie is the name of a state." Thus, Lin Hui must have been a fugitive from Jie. When Jie fell, its people fled, so Lin Hui carried the child and fled. "Yin" (殷) is an error for "Jie" (假). *Wei qi* (《为其》) is read as written; the same applies below. It may also be read *wèi* (于伪反). *Bu yu* (《布与》): "布" refers to goods and wealth.

The exegesis states: Jie is the name of a state, a fiefdom under Jin. Lin, by surname, Hui by given name, was a worthy man of Jie. "布" refers to wealth and goods. When Jie was destroyed by Jin, its people fled, and Lin Hui cast aside his precious jade disc, carried the child, and ran. Someone questioned him, suggesting it was for the sake of wealth. Yet if it were for wealth, the child had little; if for burden, the child was heavy. Abandoning something light and valuable to carry something heavy and worthless—why? The exegesis further clarifies: The jade disc represents profit-bound ties; the child represents kinship by Heaven. Kinship endures in hardship; profit-bound ties are abandoned in misfortune. The difference between abandonment and endurance is vast. ◎Qing Fan notes: *Wen Xuan*’s annotation to Wang Zhongbao’s "Chu Yuan Stele Inscription" cites Sima [Biao]’s commentary: "属 means connection." The *Shiwen* omits this.

The annotation explains: Without profit, the bond is bland; with shared Dao, it draws close. The exegesis states: Without profit, the bond is bland; with shared Dao, it draws close. With profit, the bond is sweet; when profit is exhausted, it severs. The annotation further clarifies: Those who unite without cause are joined by Heaven. If union is not based on cause, then cause cannot sever it. Yet those who unite for a cause will part for a cause. The exegesis explains: Those who unite without cause—such as the Heaven-joined bond of father and child—cannot be severed without cause. Confucius, when speaking of the traces of the former kings, said that closeness with friends is not a Heaven-joined bond but arises from the pursuit of fame and profit. This is union for a cause. When the traces are erased and the trees are felled, they depart—this is parting for a cause. It is not a Heaven-joined bond, which unites and parts without cause. Confucius said: "I respectfully heed your instruction!" He walked slowly, feigning leisure, and returned home. He abandoned learning, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer bowed before him, yet his affection for them grew ever deeper. The annotation explains: He cast aside adornment and embraced simplicity. The exegesis states: Having heard this lofty instruction, he walked slowly home, soaring and roaming at ease, free and self-content. He abandoned the learning of deliberate action, cast aside the books of sagely traces, and ceased the teachings of ornate refinement. Thus, he no longer observed the rites of bowing, yet his reverence and affection deepened daily. The *Shiwen* notes: *Wu yi* (《无挹》) is pronounced *yī* (音揖). Li [Yi] says: it means "nothing to grasp." *Qu shi* (《去饰》) is pronounced *qǔ* (起吕反). ◎Collation note: The Dunhuang manuscript reads "受" instead of "爱."

Later, Sang Hu said: "When Shun was about to die, he truly instructed Yu, saying: ‘Be vigilant! In form, nothing surpasses following; in feeling, nothing surpasses spontaneity. Following ensures no separation; spontaneity ensures no toil. Without separation or toil, there is no need to adorn form. Without adorning form, there is certainly no reliance on external things.’" The annotation explains: Follow form and act spontaneously, without distorting for profit. The exegesis states: "缘" means to follow; form must follow things, and feeling must be spontaneous. When the Great Shun was about to pass, he used this true teaching to instruct Yu, urging him to be cautious and follow these words. Thus, Sang [Hu] cited it to admonish Confucius. Some versions use "泠" (lìng), meaning "to enlighten." When Shun was about to pass, he truly enlightened Yu with these words. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhen* (《真》): Sima [Biao]’s version reads "直" (straight). *Ling* (《泠》) is pronounced *líng* (音零). Sima [Biao] says: "泠" means "to enlighten," referring to instructing Yu with the true Dao. "泠" may also be written as "命" (command) or "令" (order), both meaning "teaching." ◎Wang Yinzhi says: The *Shiwen* states that "真" in Sima’s version is "直," and "泠" is pronounced *líng*. Sima explains: "泠" means "to enlighten," referring to instructing Yu with the straight Dao. "泠" may also be written as "命" or "令," both meaning "teaching." I contend that "直" should be "□" (nǎi). "□" is the seal-script form of "乃" (nǎi), which in clerical script appears as "乃." The character "□" resembles "直," so it was mistakenly written as "直," and later as "真." "命" and "令" are interchangeable in ancient script (e.g., *Zhou Li*’s "司仪" uses "令" for "坛三成," and the *Jin Li* annotation cites "令" as "命"; the *Zuozhuan*’s "令不及鲁" has a variant "命"; *Zhuangzi*’s "田子方" chapter’s "先君之令" has a variant "命"; *Zhou Li*’s "大卜" annotation’s "以命龟也" also appears as "令"). Thus, "令" and "命" are correct. "□令禹" means "乃命禹" (he commanded Yu).

The annotation explains: Form is not artificial, so it remains whole; feeling is not forced, so it remains at ease.

The exegesis states: When form follows its nature, it constantly harmonizes with things; when one acts according to one’s inherent disposition, one’s actions remain free from corruption.

The annotation explains: Proceeding with simplicity and forthrightness.

The exegesis continues: Acting in accordance with one’s inherent nature, proceeding with simplicity and forthrightness—how could one then seek artificial embellishments or rely on external adornments to refine one’s form and nature?

The annotation explains: Simple and sufficient in itself.

The exegesis states: Since one does not seek artificial embellishments to adorn form, it is evident that each part is self-sufficient and does not depend on external things.

*Textual Note:* (1) The character 峄 is emended following *Dushu Zazhi*. (2) The character 籍 is emended to 迹 following the preceding text.

In the *Zhuangzi*, Zhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp and tied his shoes with strings when he passed by King Wei. King Wei said, “Why is the Master so distressed?”

The exegesis explains: “Coarse cloth” refers to rough cloth. Zhuangzi, being poor, wore garments of rough cloth that he had mended. 緳 refers to the straps of his shoes, or alternatively, his belt. His shoes were worn through, so he tied them with string. King Wei was King Hui of Wei. 惫 means “afflicted.” Wearing coarse cloth and tattered shoes, with his belt properly fastened, he appeared before King Wei. Seeing him, the king asked, “Why is the Master so impoverished and afflicted?”

*Phonetic Gloss:* In *Zhuangzi*, 衣 is pronounced *yù* (于既反).

The *Great Cloth* (《大布》): Sima [Biao] states: "coarse cloth."
《正緳》: pronounced *xiánjié* (贤节反), also *kǔjié* (苦结反). Sima [Biao] states: "a belt."
《系履》: Li [Yi] states: "the shoes were worn through, so they were tied."
◎My late father remarks: The *Shiwen* cites Sima [Biao] as saying, "緳 means a belt." Yet there is no other evidence that a belt is called *緳*, nor can merely tying one’s shoes be called *惫*. The *Shuowen* states: *絜* is "one end of hemp." *絜* and *緳* are interchangeable characters, meaning one arranges and binds the end of the hemp to fasten the shoes. With no silk straps, one ties them with hemp—hence the term *惫*.
《而过》: pronounced *gǔhé* (古禾反).
《魏王》: Sima [Biao] states: "King Hui."
《惫》: pronounced *píbài* (皮拜反), also *bójì* (薄计反). Sima’s text reads *病* ("affliction").

Zhuangzi said: "This is poverty, not affliction. A scholar who possesses the Dao and virtue yet cannot put them into practice—that is affliction. Wearing tattered clothes and worn-out shoes is poverty, not affliction. This is what is meant by ‘not encountering the right time.’ Have you alone not seen the soaring (*téng*) ape? When it finds itself among *nán*, *zǐ*, *yù*, and *zhāng* trees, it grasps the vines, swings among the branches, and reigns supreme—even Yi or Peng Meng would not dare cast a sidelong glance. Yet when it finds itself among *zhè*, *jí*, *zhǐ*, and *gǒu* thorns, it treads warily, glances about in fear, and trembles with dread. This is not because its sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened, but because its circumstances are unfavorable, and it cannot fully display its abilities. Now, dwelling among benighted rulers and chaotic ministers, how could one not be afflicted? This is like the fate of Bi Gan, whose heart was carved out as proof!"

【一】*Annotation*: When one encounters the right time and place, one may extend one’s finest skills, so that even the archers of old could do no harm.
【疏】*Nán*, *zǐ*, *yù*, and *zhāng* are all straight, fine trees. *Lǎnmàn* means "to grasp." *Wángzhǎng* means "to be at ease." Yi was a skilled archer of old; Peng Meng was Yi’s disciple. *Pìnì* means "to glance sideways." The character is also written as *miǎn*; one reads it according to the written form. This says that when a worthy or sage encounters the right time and place, it is like an ape among straight trees—leaping and bounding freely. Even a skilled archer would not dare cast a sidelong glance, much less draw a bow!
【释文】《螣》: pronounced *téng* (腾). Also written as *腾*.

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current text writes *téng* (腾). *Nán* is pronounced *nán* and is the name of a tree. *Lǎn* was formerly read as *lìgǎn*. *Màn* is pronounced *wàn*. Guo [Xiang] reads *wǔbàn*. *Ér wáng* is read *wǎngkuàng*; Sima [Biao]’s version writes *wǎng*. *Zhǎng* is read *dīngliàng*; another version writes *zhāng*, with the same pronunciation. Sima [Biao] reads *zhíliáng*, explaining: "The distance between two branches is great." ◎ Yu Yue says: Guo’s annotation states, "When one encounters the right time and place, one may extend one’s finest skills," reading *zhǎng* as "length" (long/short), yet this hardly accords with the original text’s meaning. Sima [Biao] says, "The distance between two branches is great," which refers to the tree itself—even less fitting. This should refer to the ape: when the ape obtains *nán*, *zǐ*, or *yùzhāng*, it leads its troop to dwell among them and acts as their lord, hence "reigns as king among them" (*wángzhǎng qíjiān*). The *Shiwen*’s readings—*wáng* as *wǎngkuàng* and *zhǎng* as *dīngliàng*—are quite apt. *Yì* is pronounced *yì*, or sometimes *hùxì*. *Péng Méng* is read *fúgōng*; Xu [Shen] reads *fúgōng*. Sima [Biao] says: "Yi was a skilled archer of old; Peng Meng was Yi’s disciple." *Miǎn* is read *mòliàn*; formerly *mòxiǎn*. Another version writes *pì*, read *pǔjì*. *Nì* is pronounced *yì*; Guo [Xiang] reads *wǔmǐ*. Li [Yi] says: "To look askance." *Chángjì* is read *qíqǐ*.

【二】【疏】*Zhè*, *jí*, *gǒu*, and *zhǐ* are all thorny, noxious trees. When an ape obtains such trees, it cannot display its agility and cunning. Thus, its heart grieves and trembles, its bearing becomes perilous and sidelong—not because its sinews and bones differ from before, but because the circumstances are unfavorable. A scholar encountering a chaotic age must act likewise.

【释文】*Zhèjí* is read *zhāngyè*. *Zhǐ* is read *jíshì*, or alternatively *zhǐ*. *Gǒu* is pronounced *jǔ*. *Dào* is read as written, or alternatively *zhídiào*. ◎ Qingfan notes: The *Shuowen* says: *Dào* means "fear"; in Chen and Chu, fear is called *dào*. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s "Lun Wei" chapter says, "The enemy is fearful, trembling, and terrified," which aligns with the sense of "quivering and trembling in fear" here. *Bùbiàn* is read *bìmiàn*; the annotation is the same. ◎ Wang Niansun says: In antiquity, the place one occupied was called *chùshì* ("position of power"). The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s "Biography of Cai Ze" states: "Kingfishers, rhinoceroses, and elephants do not necessarily die young in their habitats." Some say *shìjū* ("powerful position"). The *Yi Zhou Shu*’s "Zhou Zhu" chapter says: "One in a lowly position cannot act as a great one." Jia Yi’s "Guo Qin Lun" says: "Among the Qin kings, over twenty generations were lords of the feudal lords—such was their power." The *Huainanzi*’s "Yuan Dao" chapter says: "Inherent nature cannot be altered; one’s position cannot be shifted." Whether it is called *chùshì* or *shìjū*, the meaning is the same. The *Book of Han*’s "Biography of Chen Tang" says: "Thus, [Li] Ling relied on his natural endowments, occupied true soil, and dwelt in a high, open position."

【三】【注】If one forces action despite unfavorable circumstances, one will suffer execution. 【疏】This is the concluding analogy.

At that time, the Zhou royal house had grown weak, while the six states flourished. Thus, rulers were benighted above, and ministers chaotic below. Master Zhuang, though holding the Dao and embracing virtue, could not be employed; he concealed his traces to avoid harm, and so spoke these words. In former times, King Zhou of Yin was without the Way, and Bi Gan, though loyal in remonstrance, was disemboweled and died—was this not proof? Citing the past to verify the present, it serves as a mirror for later days.

When Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooked food. Leaning left against a withered tree, striking its withered branches with his right hand, he sang the wind of Yan Shi, possessing its form but not its measure, its sound but not its modes. The sound of wood and the sound of man, plowed clear and fitting to the human heart.

【Annotation】Yan Shi refers to Shennong.
The sage Confucius, at peace with poverty and success alike, though beset by hardship in Chen and Cai, did not abandon nonaction. Thus, with his left hand striking the withered wood and his right resting on the dead branch, he remained serene and content, singing the pure wind of Yan Shi. Wood is one of the eight timbres, yet though struck, it produces no melody; without voice, only the beating of wood—how could there be gong or shang? Yet the song’s sound and the wood’s sound, plowed clear and simple, were joyous and upright, resonating and fitting to the human heart.

"The *Biāo* of *Biāo Shì* must be read with a distant retroflex: *yáo fǎn*. It refers to the nonactive sovereigns of antiquity. *Lí rán* is read *lì xī fǎn*, or alternatively *lì zhī fǎn*. Sima [Biao] says: *lí rán* means the same as *lì rán*. *Yǒu dàng* is read *dīng làng fǎn*. Yan Hui straightened his posture, turned his gaze, and observed.

Confucius, fearing that [Yan Hui] might overestimate him and aspire to greatness, or cherish himself and fall into sorrow, said: 'Hui, to accept the decrements of Heaven is easy; to accept the increments of man is difficult. There is no beginning that is not also an end—man and Heaven are one. Who, then, is the singer of this song now?'

[Annotation] Having seen Confucius strike the wood and sing, Yan Hui straightened his body and turned his eyes to watch. Confucius, fearing he had not yet awakened and might mistakenly speculate—thinking that Confucius was magnifying his own virtue and power to aspire to great office, or pitying himself for his hardship and composing a lament—summoned him to instruct him.

[Annotation] Only by accepting it can one find it easy.

[Annotation] What comes fortuitously from external things cannot be controlled.

[Annotation] The principle of spontaneity entails that when one encounters the decrements of hardship and aligns with fate, acceptance comes easily. In human affairs, when increments such as rank and emolument arrive unexpectedly, relinquishing them is difficult. This shows that though Confucius struck the wood and sang, he harbored no sorrow or resentment.

[Annotation] What is called a beginning now was an end yesterday; thus, what is called a beginning is already an end. This speaks to the boundlessness of transformation.

[Annotation] *Zú* means "end." What is a beginning now was an end yesterday. This is meant to show that there is no beginning and no end, no birth and no death. If there is no death and no birth, how can there be sorrow over hardship?

[Annotation] All is spontaneous.

[Annotation] The so-called decrements of Heaven and increments of man are but traces of teaching. When one reaches the state of congealed principle, all is spontaneous—thus, they are not two.

[Annotation] If one allows things to be as they are, then the singer is not I.

[Annotation] The great sage is empty and forgetful, having lost both things and self. If I am not I, then who is the singer? If I have no self, where can the song reside?

[Correction] The character *jué* ("rank") is supplied here based on the subsequent pairing of "rank and emolument."

Yan Hui said: 'May I ask why accepting the decrements of Heaven is easy?'"

Confucius said: "Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, obstruction and stagnation—these are the movements of Heaven and Earth, the unfolding of the turning of things. This is what is meant by 'moving together with them.'

As a minister, one does not dare to depart from them. If even the Way of the minister is thus, how much more so the manner in which one awaits Heaven!"

[Annotation] One cannot escape them.
[Annotation] The preceding briefly states the name; what follows explains the meaning. *Zhi* means blockage. When fate reaches its end in obstruction, and the Dao and virtue cannot proceed—this is like Heaven and Earth’s emptiness and fullness, the turning of the four seasons, the movement of the myriad things, and the release of qi and climate.

[Explanation of Characters] *Qiong zhi* (穷桎): *zhi* rhymes with 實.
◎ Jia Shifu says: "Obstruction and stagnation mean that hunger, thirst, cold, and heat are sufficient to shackle a person, preventing self-contentment. Yet hunger and thirst drive them, cold and heat move them—one cannot resist and not receive them, but can only pass away together with them."
*Yun wu* (运物): Sima [Biao] says: *Yun* means movement.
*Zhi xie* (之泄): *Xie* rhymes with 列. Sima [Biao] says: it means release. Xu [Shen] reads it as 世.

[Annotation] This is what is meant by "not knowing or recognizing yet following the pattern of the Lord."
[Annotation] *Xie* means together; *shi* means to go. Having embodied the impermanence of the turning of things, one moves together with transformation and goes along with it, without joy or aversion in between.

[Explanation of Characters] *Yan yu zhi* (言与之): *Yan* means "I."

[Annotation] Wherever one is, there is peace. Not taking loss as loss—this is awaiting Heaven without receiving its decrements.
[Annotation] As a minister, one does not dare to flee the ruler’s commands. If even holding to the minister’s Way is like this, how much more so when it comes to awaiting the transformations of obstruction and passage, which must accord with the principle of spontaneity—how could one resist or refuse it!

[Correction] (1) The missing character in the Jiangnan ancient manuscript reads *wu* (物) as *hua* (化).

"What is meant by 'not receiving the increments of man is difficult'?"

Confucius said: “At the beginning, when one’s influence extends in all four directions, ranks and emoluments arrive together without end. What things find beneficial is not for oneself—my mandate lies in what is external. The noble man does not act as a thief, the worthy does not act as a pilferer. If I were to take these, what would it be for?

Thus it is said: Among birds, none is wiser than the swallow. Where its eyes find no suitable place, it does not linger to look, and though its food should fall, it abandons it and flees. Though it fears humans, it nests among them—such is the preservation of the altars of soil and grain.”

[Annotation] *Ganying pangtong* (感应旁通) means “resonance extending in all directions.”
[Annotation] Extending in all directions, one may thereby respond to what is lofty and great.
[Annotation] Not sought by oneself but received.
[Exegesis] *Shi* (始) means “root.” *Nai* (乃) means “fitting.” The wondrous root is empty and tranquil; its traces respond to the moment. Extending in all four directions, its concentrated illumination reaches the nine limits. Having no fondness for noble rank, its wealth and virtue are inexhaustible. That the myriad things seek benefit is fitting.
[Annotation] In human life, there must be the mandate of engaging with external things—unlike tiles and stones, which are limited to form and substance alone.
[Exegesis] Confucius, a sage, was endowed by Heaven’s mandate. Exercising this external virtue, he saved the black-haired people—not like tiles or stones in mere form and substance.
[Annotation] “Theft” and “pilfering” refer to taking for oneself. Now, when worthy men and noble men attain ranks and emoluments, it is not by taking for themselves but by receiving them.
[Exegesis] If worthy men and noble men do not act as thieves or pilferers, how much less would the great sage Confucius violate Heaven or go against principle to take ranks and emoluments for himself? If they come by chance and lodge with him, he receives them—that is all. It is without intent.
[Annotation] Swiftness in avoiding harm.
[Exegesis] *Yiyi* (鷾鸸) is the swallow. *Shi* (实) means “food.” In wisdom for avoiding harm and preserving its life, no bird surpasses the swallow. Flying into human dwellings to build its nest, if its eyes find the place unsuitable, it does not wait to look carefully but flies far away. Even if it drops food to the ground, it swiftly abandons it and flees, never turning back to retrieve it—such is its swiftness in avoiding harm.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Mozhi* (莫知) is read as *zhi* (智). *Yi* (鷾) is read as *yi* (意).

"The *er* (鸸) is pronounced as *er* (而). Some say: *yiyi* (鷾鸸) is the swallow. *‘Where the eye finds unsuitable’* is read *changlü* (昌吕) in reverse. It means that where it cannot stay, the eye has already perceived it through its network of vision, and so it abandons it.

[Annotation] There has never been one who distanced themselves from others yet was preserved by them. Fearing humans and entering human dwellings—this is why the bird is called wise.

[Exegesis] *Xi* (袭) means “to enter.” The swallow, fearing humans, attaches itself to them and dwells in their houses, lodging there to build its nest. Thus, people cherish and grow familiar with it, and so it escapes harm. This is just as the sage harmonizes their light while in the world, blending their traces among people, guarding against danger with caution, and not sinking into worldly realms. The common people gladly support them without tiring, and so they attain long life.

[Annotation] As for the perfected person, they are profoundly one with all under Heaven. Thus, all under Heaven gladly support them without tiring, joining together to establish them as the foundation of the altars of soil and grain. This is why it is difficult to receive the benefits of others.

[Exegesis] The sage’s virtue extends far, and all beings gladly support them. The preservation of the altars of soil and grain is thus fitting. This is what is meant by “the benefits of others.”

◎ *Jia Shifu* says: Where there is land, there is the altar of soil; where there is farmland, there is the altar of grain. The altar of soil is for dwelling; the altar of grain is for sustenance. Birds, too, have their dwellings; birds, too, have their sustenance. The swallow’s entering human dwellings does not rely on humans for shelter but rather establishes its own dwelling; it does not rely on humans for sustenance but rather provides its own nourishment.

[Collation] The character *sheng* (生) follows the *Laozi*.

“What is meant by ‘nothing has a beginning that is not also an end’?”
Confucius said: “Transforming the myriad things without perceiving what succeeds them—how could one know their end? How could one know their beginning? One simply remains upright and awaits it—that is all.”

[Annotation] Unaware of its changes.

[Exegesis] *Shan* (禅) means “to succeed.” The Dao universally gives life to the myriad things, transforming and changing all directions, revolving without cease, renewing itself daily, yet in daily use, one remains unaware. Thus, no one perceives its succession. Since it is renewed daily without change, how can there be a beginning or end?

[Phonetic Gloss] *Qishan* (其禅) is read *shizhan* (市战). Sima [Biao] says: “to bestow.”

[Annotation] Day and night succeed one another without end. Thus, one remains upright and awaits it, without harboring any concerns.

[Exegesis] For the end is the beginning, and the beginning is the end—how can one determine beginning and end? Since there is no end or beginning, there is no death or life. Thus, one follows change and submits to transformation, finding all encounters fitting. Holding fast to the true and upright, one awaits the Creator alone.

[Phonetic Gloss] *Yanzhi* (焉知) is read *yuqian* (于虔). The same below."

“What does it mean for man and Heaven to be one?” Confucius said: “Where there is man, there is Heaven; where there is Heaven, there is also Heaven. That man cannot possess Heaven is his nature. The sage, at ease, embodies passing and comes to an end.”

[Annotation] All that is called Heaven makes clear what is not done but is spontaneous.

[Exegesis] Among human relations and the myriad things, none is not spontaneous. Extending even to spontaneity itself, thus man and Heaven are not two, and the myriad things merge as one.

[Annotation] To speak of spontaneity is to speak of spontaneity—how could man deliberately possess this spontaneity? It is spontaneous, and thus is called nature.

[Exegesis] Spontaneity is that which is so without knowing why it is so—it is spontaneous, not made. How could it be something one possesses? If one claims to possess it, then it is not spontaneity. Thus, we know spontaneity is nature, not something man possesses. This explains the earlier meaning of “possessing Heaven.”

[Annotation] At ease and without affectation, the body moves with change.

[Exegesis] *Yanran* means at ease. *Shi* means to pass. The sage, understanding the non-duality of beginning and end, realizing the oneness of death and life, can thus calmly dissolve the body, follow transformation, and pass away—floating without beginning, submitting to change and coming to an end.

◎ Jia Shifu says: Mencius spoke of the mouth’s delight in flavors, the eye’s delight in colors, the ear’s delight in sounds, the nose’s delight in scents, and the four limbs’ delight in ease and comfort as nature, yet subject to fate. What Zhuangzi calls “man’s inability to possess Heaven” is precisely what Mencius meant by “nature being subject to fate.” Zhuangzi takes what is bound by things and desires as man, and spontaneity as Heaven, thus severing sounds and colors, abandoning scents and flavors, and dividing Heaven and man into two. When he speaks of man and Heaven as one, it is still a matter of abandoning man to align with Heaven. The sage exhausts nature to know Heaven, and this work does not go beyond daily eating and drinking. What is nature is subject to fate, yet it is not called nature; what is fate contains nature, yet it is not called fate—this is what is meant by Heaven and man being one.

Zhuang Zhou wandered within the fence of *Diaoling*, a chestnut grove, when he saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, and its eyes measured a full inch across. It brushed against Zhuang Zhou’s forehead and settled in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said: “What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly, its eyes are large yet it does not see?” He tucked up his robes, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada, having found a fine shade, forget its body; a mantis, seizing the cover, struck at it, seeing only its gain and forgetting its form; the strange magpie, following after, took advantage of it, seeing only profit and forgetting its true nature. Zhuang Zhou, startled, said: “Alas! Things indeed entangle one another, and the two kinds summon each other!” He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued and berated him.

[Exegesis] *Diaoling* is the name of a chestnut grove. *Fan* means fence, referring to wandering within the chestnut grove’s wicker enclosure. *Yun* means round. *Gan* means to touch. *Sang* means forehead. An extraordinary magpie came from the south, its wings seven feet long, its eyes a full inch round. It struck Zhuang Zhou’s forehead and then perched in the chestnut grove.

[Phonetic Gloss] *Diao* is read *diao* in Xu’s pronunciation. Originally also written as *diao*.

《Ling’s Fan》 is pronounced *fán*. Sima Biao states: *Diao Ling* is the name of a mound; *fan* means fence, referring to wandering within the chestnut grove’s wicker enclosure. *Fan* is sometimes written as *ye* (wild), the ancient form of *ye*. *Yi Guang* is pronounced *guāng làng* in *Guangyun*. *Yun Cun*: Sima Biao states: “capable of turning one *cun*.” ◎Wang Niansun says: Sima Biao explains *yun cun* as “capable of turning one *cun*.” However, Sima takes *yun* to mean “turning,” which is incorrect. *Yun cun* parallels *guang qi chi* (seven feet wide) in structure—*guang* being horizontal, *yun* thus vertical. “Eyes large *yun cun*” simply means “eyes a full *cun* in diameter.” In the *Yue Yu*, it says, “Goujian’s land spans a hundred *li* in *guang yun*”; Wei’s commentary states: “East-west is *guang*, south-north is *yun*.” Thus *yun* means vertical. The *Western Mountains Classic* says, “This mountain spans a hundred *li* in *guang yuan*.” *Yuan* is synonymous with *yun*. The *Zhou Officials’ Great Controller of Land* records the *guang lun* (breadth and length) of the Nine Provinces’ territories; the *Rites of the Officer of Earth* states, “one *chi* wide, two *chi* in *lun*”; Zheng’s commentary explains both: “*lun* means vertical.” *Lun* and *yun* are phonetically close and share the same meaning—*guang lun* is thus *guang yun*.

《Gan Zhou zhi Sang》 is pronounced *xī dàng*. Li Yi states: *gan* means to touch. 【二】【Exegesis】 *Yin* means great; *shi* means to depart; *jué bù* means swift movement; *liú* means to lie in wait. With wings too large to fly far and eyes too large to see clearly, Zhuang Zhou marveled at the magpie’s condition. He then conceived the idea of pursuing it, striding swiftly forward with sling in hand to lie in wait. 【Phonetic Gloss】《Wings vast, not departing; eyes large, not seeing》: Sima Biao states: *yin* means vast; *shi* means winding. Li Yi states: with wings too vast to depart and eyes too large to see clearly, it failed to notice the man. 《Jian》 is pronounced *qǐ qián*. 《Jué》: Li pronounces it *qū bì*, Xu as *jiǔ fù*. Sima Biao states: swift movement. This aligns with the *Analects*: “feet moving *jué* as if...” 《Zhi Dan》 is pronounced *tú dàn*. 《Liu zhi》: Li Jiu states: *liú* means to linger and await the opportunity. 【三】【Annotation】 Holding a leaf to conceal himself from the cicada, he forgot his own form was visible to the strange magpie. 【Phonetic Gloss】《Tang》 is pronounced *táng*. 《Lang》 is pronounced *láng*. 《Zhi Yi》 is pronounced *yú jì*. Sima Biao states: holding grass to conceal oneself. 《Bo zhi》: Guo pronounces it *bó*, Xu as *fù*. 《Zhi jian hu》 is pronounced *xián biàn*. 【四】【Annotation】 Eyes that can see, wings that can fly—these are the bird’s true nature. Now, seeing profit, it forgets them. 【Exegesis】 *Bo* means to capture; *zhen* means nature and life. Zhuang Zhou, sling in hand but not yet released, suddenly saw a cicada concealed among the leaves, delighting in the shade and oblivious to its body. A mantis, holding a leaf to conceal itself, intent on capturing the cicada, failed to notice its form was visible to the strange magpie. The magpie, following the mantis, seized the opportunity to capture the cicada, intent on profit and unaware of the danger to its life—this is what is meant by “forgetting the true.” 【Phonetic Gloss】《Qi zhen》: Sima Biao states: *zhen* means body. 【五】【Annotation】 Those who seek profit from one another are ever entangled. 【Exegesis】 Having witnessed the cicada and magpie forsaking their lives for profit, he was startled and alarmed, uttering a sigh. Thus he knew that those who seek profit from things must suffer entanglement. 【Phonetic Gloss】《Chu ran》 is pronounced *zhào lǜ*. 【六】【Annotation】 One who desires something from things will likewise be desired by them. 【Exegesis】 One who desires something from things will likewise be desired by them. Thus the cicada and magpie, both creatures of the world, summon harm through their pursuit of profit—this must be so. 【七】【Annotation】 *Sui* means to question. 【Exegesis】 *Juan* means to discard. The *yuren* was the warden of the chestnut grove. *Sui* means to question. Realizing that harm follows profit, he cast aside his sling and turned to flee. The warden, suspecting him of stealing chestnuts, pursued and questioned him. 【Phonetic Gloss】《Sui zhi》 is also written as *xun*, pronounced *xìn*, meaning to question. Sima Biao states: he took Zhou for a chestnut thief. 【Collation】 (1) *Quē wù* is written as *qiān*; Zhang’s edition has *jiǎn*. (2) Zhao Jianyi’s edition has *cháng* instead of *xiāng*.

Zhuang Zhou returned home and did not step into the courtyard for three months. Lin Qie followed and asked him: “Master, why have you not come to the courtyard at all of late?” 【一】【Exegesis】 Zhuang Zhou, having seen the magpie forget its life and been suspected of stealing chestnuts, returned home in shame and did not leave his courtyard. Lin, whose given name was Qie, was a disciple of Zhuangzi. Wondering why his master had shut himself indoors of late, he followed and asked him. 【Phonetic Gloss】《San yue bu ting》: one edition has “three days.” Sima Biao states: he did not leave his seat in the courtyard for three months. ◎Wang Niansun says: The *Phonetic Gloss* states, “three months not *ting*—one edition has three days.” Sima Biao explains: “he did not leave his seat in the courtyard for three months.” If Sima’s interpretation were correct, *ting* would require the addition of *chu* (to leave) for clarity. The following line reads, “Master, why have you been so *bu ting* of late?” If *bu ting* meant “not leaving the courtyard,” the phrasing would be even more awkward. I propose that *ting* should be read as *chěng* (content). *Bu chěng* means discontent; *shen bu chěng* means deeply discontent. Having forgotten his body and his true nature, he was humiliated by the warden—hence his discontent. The *Fangyan* states: *chěng* means clear, content. East of the Pass, it is called *xiǎo* or *chěng*; in the regions of Jiang, Huai, Chen, and Chu, it is called *chěng*. The *Zuozhuan* of Duke Huan’s sixth year states, “Now the people are starving, yet the lord indulges his desires”; the *Zhou Language* states, “Duke Guo of Guo exhausted the people to indulge his transgressions”; Wei and Du’s commentaries both explain: *chěng* means content.

The character *chěng* was anciently pronounced like *chéng* (呈), its sound close to *tíng* (庭), hence interchangeable with it. (Zhang Heng’s *Sikong Thoughts Rhapsody* rhymes *bù chěng* with *qíng*, *míng*, *shēng*, *yíng*, *píng*, *zhēng*, *zhēn*, *míng*, *róng*, and *níng*. The *Shuowen* states: *chěng* is composed of 辶 with *chéng* as phonetic. The *Zuozhuan* of Duke Xi’s twenty-third year reads “excessive punishments to *chěng* [his desires],” where the *Shiwen* notes *chěng* as *chéng*. The *Fangyan* states: *chěng* means to release. The *Guangya* writes it as *chéng*.) “Three months of *bu ting*”—one version reads “three days,” which is correct. Below it says, “Master, why have you been so *bu ting* of late?” If it had been three months, it could not be called “of late.” *Lìn* (蔺) is read with the entering tone as *lì xìn*. One version writes it as *lìn* (). *Qiě* (且) is read as *zǐ yú*. Sima [Biao] says: Lin Qie was a disciple of Zhuangzi. ◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Wenxuan*’s commentary on Guo Jingchun’s *Jiang Fu* cites Sima: “*Qǐng* means long duration.” Xie Lingyun’s poem *Entering Huazi Cave, the Third Valley of Mamasource* and its commentary cite Sima: “*Qǐng* means constant duration.” The *Shiwen* omits this. 【Collation】 (1) *Quewulun* cites the Jiangnan old manuscript, adding the character *gōng* below.

Zhuang Zhou said: “I preserved my form yet forgot my person. I observed the turbid waters and became lost in the clear abyss. Moreover, I have heard from the Master: ‘Enter their customs, follow their commands.’ Now I wandered in Carved Mound and forgot myself; a strange magpie struck my forehead. I roamed in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature; the warden of the chestnut grove took me for a criminal—this is why I have been so *bu ting*.”

◎ **Annotation (1):** When one’s person dwells in the human world, where the world holds both safety and peril, to extend the form of safety and ease into this world without measuring what is fitting for this world—this is to preserve one’s form yet forget one’s person.
**Explication:** *Yí yì* (夷易) is pronounced *yǐ chǐ* (以豉反). *Bù duó* (不度) is pronounced *zhí luò* (直落反).

◎ **Annotation (2):** To see another yet remain unclear, thus using the other to see oneself, is nearly to forget the Way of turning the mirror back.
**Exegesis:** I, seeing profit and pursuing things, clung to preserving my form, yet profit and harm summoned one another—this is to forget one’s person. Having witnessed the magpie and cicada, I returned home and did not step beyond the gate, doubting and reproaching myself. This is what is meant by observing the turbid waters and so becoming lost in the clear spring. Though it does not accord with one’s original nature and the true, it still retains the Way of turning the light back.
**Explication:** *Zì jiàn* (自見) is pronounced *xiàn biàn* (賢遍反).

◎ **Annotation (3):** It means not violating their prohibitions and commands.

The Exegesis states: Zhuang Zhou studied under Lao Dan, hence he referred to Laozi as "the Master." The enlightened move with the dust and enter the world, and where the world has prohibitions and commands, they follow and act accordingly. Yet now, having wandered into that carved mound, he was suspected of stealing chestnuts and lightly violated the legal statutes—words of regret and self-reproach.

◎ **Annotation (4):** To treat being questioned as execution. Zhuangzi extended impartiality to the world, thus often conveying meaning through words, even to the point of slandering Confucius, disparaging Lao Dan, striking above at the Three Sovereigns, and lamenting the afflictions of his own person below.

The Exegesis states: His intent fixed on the strange magpie, he forgot the prohibitions of the chestnut grove—this is to forget oneself. The character is also written as *zhen* (真), to be read as such. The gamekeeper called me a chestnut thief, thus bringing such shame and humiliation upon myself—this is why he did not remain in the court. Zhuangzi was a great man, yet he concealed himself in a lowly position, roaming the state of Song and nurturing his nature in the lacquer garden. How could he be one who lost himself in the clear abyss or fixated on profit and harm? Rather, he sought to evaluate and critique the natures of all beings, even at the cost of harming himself.

◎ **Philological Notes:** 《上掊》 pronounced *pǔ kǒu* (普口反).
◎ **Collation:** (1) The character *lìng* (令) follows the emendation in *Quēwù* citing Cheng Xuanying’s edition; Guo’s commentary also writes *lìng*. (2) *Quēwù* cites *Rúhǎi* and Zhang Junfang’s editions, where "chestnut grove" is written as □□. (3) Zhao Jianyi’s edition omits the three characters *yán yǐ chū* (言以出).

When Master Yang traveled to Song, he lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Master Yang asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied, “The beautiful one is self-aware of her beauty, so I do not recognize her as beautiful. The ugly one is self-aware of her ugliness, so I do not recognize her as ugly.”

◎ **Annotation (1):** His surname was Yang, given name Zhu, courtesy name Ziju, a native of Qin. *Nìlǚ* (逆旅) means an inn. Traveling to the state of Song, he lodged at an inn in the region. The beautiful one, relying on her beauty, caused others to forget her beauty and not acknowledge it. The ugly one, humble and self-deprecating, caused others to forget her ugliness and not acknowledge it.

◎ **Philological Notes:** 《阳子》 Sima [Biao] states: Yang Zhu.
◎ **Collation:** (1) *Quēwù* cites Liu Deyi’s edition, where *rén* (人) is written as *zhī* (之).

Master Yang said, “Disciples, take note! Act with virtue yet discard the conduct of self-regard—where could you go and not be beloved?”

◎ **Annotation (1):** The Way of self-regard is never admissible.

The Exegesis states: To cultivate virtue and establish conduct while discarding the heart of self-regard and disdain for others—where could one go and not be cherished? Thus, he commanded his disciples to remember this.

◎ **Philological Notes:** 《而去》 pronounced *qǐ lǚ* (起吕反). 《之行》 pronounced *xià mèng* (下孟反).
◎ **Collation:** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition includes the character *yě* (也) after *kě* (可).

**Scroll 7 (Part 2) – Outer Chapters**
**Chapter 21: Tian Zifang**
**Chapter 22: Outer Chapters: "Knowledge Wanders North"**
**Chapter 21: Tian Zifang**

◎ **Philological Notes:** The chapter is named after the person.

Tian Zifang sat in attendance upon Marquis Wen of Wei and repeatedly praised Xi Gong.

◎ **Exegesis:** His surname was Tian, given name Wuze, courtesy name Zifang, a worthy of Wei and the teacher of Marquis Wen. Marquis Wen was the seventh-generation descendant of Bi Wan and the father of Marquis Wu. Xi was his surname, Gong his given name, also a worthy of Wei.

◎ **Philological Notes:** 《田子方》 Li [Xi] states: Tian Zifang was the teacher of Marquis Wen of Wei, given name Wuze.
◎ **Qingfan’s Note:** The *Philological Notes* cites Li [Xi], stating Tian Zifang’s given name was Wuze. *Wuze* should be *Wu*. *Dù* (斁) and *zé* (择) both derive from *gāo* (睪), and were interchangeable in ancient script. In the *Book of Songs*, *Great Odes: "Si Qi"* (思齐), "the ancients were without *dù*" (无斁), Zheng’s commentary writes *wúzé* (无择). The *Shuowen* states: *Dù* means weariness, or alternatively, completion. Without weariness, there is constancy, hence his courtesy name was Zifang. (Zheng’s commentary on the *Rites: Tan Gong* states: *Fāng* means constancy.)

《数称》 pronounced *shuāng jué* (双角反), or *suǒ zhǔ* (所主反). The same below.
《溪》 pronounced *xī* (溪), or *xī* (兮). Sima’s edition writes *jī* (鸡).
《工》 Li [Xi] states: Xi Gong was a worthy.

Marquis Wen said, “Is Xi Gong your teacher?”
Zifang replied, “No, he is a fellow villager of mine. His praises of the Way often accord with principle, so I extol him.”

◎ **Exegesis:** Xi Gong was a villager of Zifang. When he spoke of the Way, his words frequently aligned with reason, so Wuze praised him—he was not his teacher.

Marquis Wen said, “In that case, do you have no teacher?”

Zifang said, “I do.”

Marquis Wen asked, “Who is your teacher?”

Zifang replied, “Dongguo Shunzi.”

Marquis Wen said, “Then why have you never spoken of him?”

◎ **Exegesis:** He lived east of the outer wall, hence his surname; his given name was Shunzi, and he was Zifang’s teacher. Since he was the Master’s teacher, why did Wuze never speak of him?

Zifang said, “His person is true—human in form yet celestial in nature, empty yet attuned to things while preserving the real, pure yet embracing all. When things lack the Way, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. How could one such as Wuze be worthy to speak of him?”

◎ **Annotation:** Without artifice.
◎ **Exegesis:** He is what is called a true Daoist.
◎ **Annotation:** Though his form is like that of others, he alone follows nature.
◎ **Exegesis:** Though his appearance accords with human principles, his mind harmonizes with nature.
◎ **Annotation:** Empty and in accord with things, thus his reality is never lost.
◎ **Exegesis:** *Yuan* means to follow. With an empty mind, he follows things while ever guarding the true source, moving yet ever tranquil.
◎ **Exegesis (Sound Gloss):** *Baozhen* (葆真) is pronounced *bao* (保). The original also writes *bao* (保).
◎ **Annotation:** The pure risk excessive fastidiousness; now pure yet embracing all, he is one with Heaven.
◎ **Exegesis:** As Guo’s annotation states: “The pure risk excessive fastidiousness; now pure yet embracing all, he is one with Heaven.”
◎ **Exegesis (Sound Gloss):** *Da jie* (大絜) is pronounced *tai* (泰).
◎ **Yu Yue’s Note:** Guo’s annotation takes “human in form yet celestial” (*ren mao er tian*) as a single phrase, but this misreads the passage. It should be punctuated as “human in form, celestial in emptiness” (*ren mao er tian xu*). “Human form, celestial emptiness” form a parallel construction, just as “attuned yet preserving the real” (*yuan er bao zhen*) parallels “pure yet embracing all” (*qing er rong wu*). *Xu* (虚) means aperture or cavity. The *Huainanzi*’s “Fanlun” chapter states: “If one follows the empty to go in and out,” with Gao You’s note: “*Xu* means aperture or cavity.” Since it denotes apertures, it also denotes the mind. The “Chuzhen” chapter says, “An empty room generates brightness,” with the note: “*Xu* means the mind.” The *Tai Xuan Jing*’s “Duan” section, first hexagram, says, “Cut off the mind, destroy the axe,” while the “Shi” section, first hexagram, says, “Pierce the empty, destroy the blade.” “Destroy the blade” is the same as “destroy the axe,” and “pierce the empty” is the same as “cut off the mind.” Thus, the “Yi” section, first hexagram, says, “Cherish awe, fill the empty,” which means to fill the mind. For further discussion, see the *Tai Xuan Jing*. Here, “human in form, celestial in emptiness” (*ren mao er tian xu*) is equivalent to “human in form, celestial in mind” (*ren mao er tian xin*), meaning that in form he is human, but in mind he is celestial. Scholars who fail to grasp the meaning of *xu* mistakenly attach it to the following phrase, leaving “human in form yet celestial” incomplete in sense. The two subsequent parallel phrases thus become uneven. The *Yangsheng Zhu* chapter’s “Follow the supervisor as the constant” (*yuan du yi wei jing*) has a gloss by Li (Xun) stating: “*Yuan* means to follow.” “Attuned yet preserving the real” (*yuan er bao zhen*) means “following yet preserving the real.” Prefixing *xu* here would render it meaningless.
◎ **Annotation:** Vast and clear, empty and upright, he rectifies himself alone, and the perversity of things naturally dissolves.
◎ **Exegesis:** When worldly things lack the Way, or when people are devious, Dongguo simply corrects his bearing to enlighten them, causing their deluded and disordered intentions to dissolve naturally.
◎ **Exegesis (Sound Gloss):** *Wu xie* (物邪) is pronounced *si jie* (似嗟反).
◎ **Exegesis:** The teacher’s profound virtue is so abstruse that Wuze, in his mediocrity, is unworthy to extol it!

Zifang departed. Marquis Wen, lost in thought, remained silent for the rest of the day. He summoned his ministers who stood before him and said, “How distant is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I took the words of the sagely and wise, the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, to be the ultimate. But now that I have heard of Zifang’s teacher, my body feels unstrung and unwilling to move, my mouth clamped shut and unwilling to speak. What I have learned is but a clod of earth—truly, Wei has become a burden to me!”

◎ **Exegesis:** *Tangran* (傥然) describes a state of self-loss. Upon hearing of Shunzi’s virtue, Marquis Wen was left adrift, bereft of grounding, and naturally forgot his own words—hence his silence for the rest of the day. Then, summoning the ministers who stood before him, he spoke with them, sighing over Dongguo’s Dao, so profound and distant as to be unfathomable. Truly, the man of perfect virtue could govern the myriad things as a true lord.

◎ **Sound Gloss:** *Tangran* (傥然) is pronounced *chi dang* (敕荡反). Sima [Biao] says: it denotes a loss of resolve. *Er yu* (而语) is pronounced *yu ju* (鱼据反).

◎ **Annotation:** He realized his own limitations.

◎ **Sound Gloss:** *Sheng zhi* (圣知) is pronounced *zhi* (智). *Zhi xing* (之行) is pronounced *xia meng* (下孟反). *Xing jie* (形解) is pronounced *hu mai* (户买反). *Kou qian* (口钳) is pronounced *qi yan* (其炎反); [Xu] (徐) reads it *qi yan* (其严反).

◎ **Annotation:** Not a true thing.

◎ **Exegesis:** At first, I pursued learning, taking the words of the sagely wisdom of the former kings and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness of Zhou and Kong as the ultimate principle.

Now, having heard the teachings of Master Zi Fang’s master, I find his Dao vast and expansive. It has caused my form to dissolve and scatter, leaving me unable to move or rest, my mouth and tongue bound and exhausted, with nothing to say. I realize that what I have studied is but the work of a clay man—crumbling at the first touch of rain, not a true thing at all.

A *clay puppet* is a clay man.

◎ **Sound Gloss:** *Zhi* (直) is read as written. Originally also written as *zhen* (真), and the following sentence is the same. The Yuanjia edition writes *zhen* (真) here, and *zhi* (直) in the next sentence.
◎ Lu Wenchang says: The current text reads *zhen* (真).
◎ *Tu geng* (土梗) is pronounced *geng meng* (更猛反). Sima [Biao] says: *Tu geng* refers to a clay man, which crumbles when exposed to rain.
◎ Qing Fan notes: The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Liu Xiaobiao’s *Guang Juejiao Lun* cites Sima [Biao] as saying: *Geng* means the stubble of earth; a clod. The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* (vol. 20) cites Sima [Biao] as saying: *Tu geng* is a wooden puppet of earth, or a wooden man; earth and wood paired together, referring to figures shaped like humans, all called *ou* (偶, puppets). This differs from the *Shiwen*.

◎ **Annotation:** To know what is most noble is to see human rank as a burden.

◎ **Exegesis:** Having heard the true Dao, I have collapsed in body and forgotten all, thus recognizing that official rank is but a mound of earth—nothing more than a source of worry and encumbrance.

◎ **Textual Note:** (一) The character *Xu* (徐) follows the *Shi De Tang* edition.

When Wen Bo Xuezi traveled to Qi, he lodged in Lu. A man of Lu requested an audience with him. Wen Bo Xuezi said, “It cannot be. I have heard that the *junzi* of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but crude in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet them.”

◎ **Exegesis:** His surname was Wen, his given name Bo, and his courtesy name Xuezi. He was a man of Chu who embodied the Dao. *Zhongguo* refers to the state of Lu. *Lou* (陋) means clumsy.

From Chu to Qi, he passed through Lu and stayed at his host’s lodging. The people of Lu were disciples of Confucius, and having heard that Wen Bo Xue was a worthy man, they requested to meet him. Wen Bo refused, saying, “I have heard that the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness and the sagely traces, yet clumsy in understanding the human heart—this is why I do not wish to meet them.”

**Exegesis:** *Wen Bo Xuezi*—Li [Yun] says: a worthy man of the southern lands.

Upon reaching Qi, he returned and stayed again in Lu, where the same man once more requested an audience.

Wen Bo Xuezi said, “In the past, you sought to meet me; now, you seek to meet me again—you must have some reason to move me.”

**Exegesis:** *Qi* means to seek. *Zhen* means to stir. When I traveled to Qi before, you sought to meet me; now that I have returned to Lu, you come again to seek an audience—you must have some other purpose, wishing to move me with it.

**Exegesis:** *Qi* is pronounced *qi* (祈).

He went out to meet the guest, then returned and sighed. The next day, he met the guest again, and upon returning, sighed once more. His servant asked, “Each time you meet a guest, you return and sigh—why is this?”

**Exegesis:** After meeting guests both times, he repeatedly sighed to himself. Wen Bo’s servant, finding this strange, questioned him.

Wen Bo Xuezi said, “I have already told you: ‘The people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual propriety yet crude in understanding the human heart.’ In the past, those who came to see me advanced and withdrew as if following a compass, as if adhering to a square; their demeanor was at once dragon-like and tiger-like. When they admonished me, it was as a son to a father; when they guided me, it was as a father to a son—this is why I sighed.”

**Exegesis:** Their steps were winding, their footprints serpentine.
**Exegesis:** Their bowing and yielding, their advancing and retreating—all conformed to square and circle; their movements were sinuous as a dragon, their bearing majestic as a tiger.
**Pronunciation Notes:** *Congrong* (從容) is read as *qī róng*; *panpi* (盤辟) as *bì yì*; *yi* (遺) as in the standard reading, though some texts write it as *wei* (逶), read *yú wēi*; *she* (蛇) as *yǐ zhī*.
**Exegesis:** The corruption of ritual propriety gives rise to such affectations.
**Pronunciation Notes:** *Qi dao* (其道) is read as *qí dǎo*.
**Exegesis:** They corrected me as a son admonishes a father; they instructed me as a father teaches a son. Though distance and proximity, honor and humility each have their proper sentiments, these are not of Heaven’s nature—why then such earnest pretense? Thus do we know that the corruption of the sage’s path leads to such artifice, and this is why I sighed.

Confucius met him and said nothing.
Zilu said, “Master, you have long wished to meet Wen Bo Xuezi. Now that you have met him and said nothing, why is this?”
**Exegesis:** He already understood his heart.

The two were in perfect accord, thus forgetting speech. Zilu found this strange and so raised his question.

Confucius said, “In the case of such a man, the Dao is present the moment one’s gaze meets his—no room remains for words.”

**Exegesis:** The instant the eyes move, understanding is already complete; there is no place for the resonance of virtue’s voice.
**Pronunciation Notes:** *Fu ren* (夫人) is read as *fú rén*.
**Exegesis:** For one who embodies awakened insight, the principle is grasped without words. The moment the eyes move, the profound Dao is already present—no need for further expenditure of speech or accommodation of his voice.
**Pronunciation Notes:** *Mu ji er Dao cun yi* (目击而道存矣): Sima Biao says, “One sees his eyes move, and the spirit is already manifest.” *Ji* means “to move.” Guo Xiang says, “The moment the eyes move, understanding is already complete.”

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, “When you walk, I walk; when you hasten, I hasten; when you run, I run. Yet when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly from behind!”

Confucius said, “Hui, what do you mean?”

Yan Yuan replied, “When you walk, I walk; when you speak, I speak; when you hasten, I hasten; when you debate, I debate; when you run, I run; when you discourse on the Dao, I too discourse on the Dao. But when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, and I can only stare blankly from behind—it is because you are trusted without speaking, you are in harmony without attachment, and though you hold no vessel of office, the people gather before you as water flows downward. I simply do not know how this comes to be.”

**Exegesis:** “Racing ahead, leaving all dust behind” means running swiftly. *Cheng* (瞠) describes the appearance of staring straight ahead. When one’s speed outstrips all traces, it cannot be matched, so one can only stare blankly from behind. *Qi* (器) refers to rank or office. The Master is trusted without speaking, moves in harmony with all things without attachment, and though he holds no position of lordship, the people tread before him as if drawn by a current. Not knowing how this comes to be, one can only accept it as it is—this is what is meant by “racing ahead, leaving all dust behind.”

**Pronunciation Notes:** *Ben yi* (奔逸): Sima Biao’s edition also writes it as *che* (彻). *Cheng* (瞠): *Chi geng* (敕庚) *fan* (反), also *chou lang* (丑郎) *fan* (反). The *Zilin* says: “the appearance of staring straight ahead.” Another pronunciation: *du geng* (杜哽) *fan* (反), also *chi meng* (敕孟) *fan* (反). ◎ Qing Fan’s note: The *Hou Hanshu* “Biography of Recluses” commentary and the *Wen Xuan* “Fan Weizong’s ‘Discourse on Recluses’” commentary both cite Sima Biao: “It means one cannot keep pace.” This is omitted in the *Pronunciation Notes*. *Bu bi er zhou* (不比而周): *pi zhi* (毗志) *fan* (反). *Tao hu qian* (滔乎前): *tu dao* (吐刀) *fan* (反), meaning without the vessel of lordship, the people gather before him like a surging current. Another pronunciation: *du gao* (杜高) *fan* (反).

**Textual Note:** (1) The character *you* (又) and *chou* (丑) are amended following the *Shi De Tang* edition.

Confucius said, “Alas! How can one fail to examine this?”

Alas! No sorrow is greater than the death of the heart, while the death of the person is secondary to it.

The sun rises in the eastern quarter and sets in the western extreme—all things without exception follow its course. Those with eyes and feet depend on it to accomplish their ends: when it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish. All things are likewise: some await it to die, some await it to live.

Once I received my completed form, I did not transform but waited for its end. I moved in imitation of things, day and night without pause, yet knew not where it would conclude. My form was thus completed, yet I knew my fate could not be foreseen before me—with this, I daily declined.

**Note (1):** When the heart takes death as death, it only hastens its own demise. The swiftness of its death arises from sorrow’s self-destruction. Without sorrow, it would be nothing; with sorrow, the death of the heart is the greatest sorrow of all.

**Exegesis:** To be all-encompassing without comparison, to be trustworthy without speech—this arises from an empty heart in accord with things. How could it be otherwise? How could one fail to forget concerns and reflect, to still the heart and examine closely? Of all the burdens of emotion, none surpasses the heart’s transformations. These transformations of arising and ceasing are deeply lamentable, while the sorrow of life and death is secondary.

**Pronunciation Notes:** *Wu ke* (恶可) is read as *wu*. *Cha yu* (察与) is read as *yu*. Below, *ai yu* (哀与) is the same. *Zi sang* (自丧) is read as *xi lang*; the same applies in the next chapter.

**Note (2):** All is visible.

**Exegesis:** Night’s darkness and day’s brightness, the sun’s rising in the east and setting in the west—these are like a person entering obscurity and emerging into clarity, dying and being born, departing and returning. Thus we know that human life and death are like heaven’s day and night. Using this analogy, what is there to lament?

◎ Jia Shifu says: When the sun rises, all things move with it; when it sets, all things rest. It is its light that governs this. No being that depends on light for movement can exist outside this principle. To move with the light, to live with the qi—this is simply to follow the natural order. If one cannot harness qi to sustain life, one likewise cannot forcibly summon light to initiate movement. The light of yesterday is the same as the light of today, yet one cannot grasp today’s light and use it to measure yesterday’s in every detail. To cling to today’s light in order to measure yesterday’s is to let it slip through one’s fingers. Each has its own pace and rhythm. Resemblance lies in the rhythm, but what makes them resemble is not the rhythm itself. Only when both are forgotten within the rhythm does one fully accord with the Dao. Only by forgetting can what should not be forgotten then abide. To be indifferent to human rhythms is to ride the sun’s light without knowing movement—this is called human death. To forcibly impose a rhythm in pursuit of alignment is to forget today’s light and seek it in the past—this is called the death of the heart. Death is that which clings rigidly without transformation, holds fast without yielding.

Zhuangzi’s words are sublime; they must be grasped with spiritual insight.

**[3] Note:** The eyes achieve the work of seeing, the feet achieve the work of walking.

**Exegesis:** The toes are part of the feet. All the body’s limbs are endowed by yin and yang; the eyes see and the feet walk by virtue of creation’s power. Without these, how could their functions be achieved? Thus we know that life and death are not within human control.

**[4] Note:** It is merely that one does not see it as existing, yet it never ceases to exist.

**Exegesis:** To see the sun rise is to call it existence; to watch it set is to call it extinction—this is the reckless attachment of ordinary sentiment, not the penetrating vision of the sage.

**[5] Note:** To await concealment is called death; to await manifestation is called life—yet in truth, there is no death or life.

**Exegesis:** The concealment and manifestation of things all depend on creation. Concealment is called death; manifestation is called life. Since the sun’s rising and setting entail no true existence or extinction, how can the concealment and manifestation of things involve life and death?

**[6] Note:** For that which cannot change from being into non-being, once a form is received, transformation continues without end.

**Exegesis:** Our forms and natures are bestowed by creation. Bright or dim, fair or foul—the boundaries are already set. Once fixed, there is no further change, only an enduring constancy awaiting exhaustion. Thus the years come to an end. Since beauty and ugliness are not subject to free will, the principle of life and death must likewise be entrusted to fate.

**[7] Note:** This arises from having no mind of one’s own.

**Exegesis:** The utmost sage is empty and still; when stimuli come, responses arise. Things move, and movement follows—this is the nature of having no mind of one’s own.

**[8] Note:** Ever transforming, ever new.

**Exegesis:** Change and renewal occur daily, vanishing without a trace.

**[9] Note:** Not taking death as death.

**Exegesis:** Following it, one does not see what comes after.

**[10] Note:** Fuming forth of itself—what else could bring it about?

**Exegesis:** *Xunran* describes the appearance of self-motion. Fuming forth, endowed with qi to form a body—nothing makes it so.

**Pronunciation Notes:** *Xunran* (熏然) is read as *xuyun*.

**[11] Note:** Not bound to what came before, it moves forward with change—hence it is called "departing."

**Exegesis:** *Cu*, meaning "to go." One who comprehends the changes of time cannot prearrange a pattern; embodying daily renewal, one thus moves forward with transformation.

**Pronunciation Notes:** *Ri cu* (日徂) is read as written. Sima’s edition writes it as *ju*, glossing it as "illness."

All my life, I have clasped your arm and lost you—how could this not be lamentable? You are perilously attached to what I am attached to. That has already ended, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like searching for a horse in a market where pottery is sold.

I have worn you so thoroughly that I forget you; you have worn me so thoroughly that you forget me. Even so, what cause for concern do you have? Though you forget what was before, I have what cannot be forgotten abiding within.

**[1] Note:** Transformation cannot be grasped and held in place.

Thus, though you clasp arms and guard one another, you cannot make it halt—if you mourn the dead, then this too is cause for mourning. Yet people have never taken this as cause for grief; why then mourn death alone?

**Commentary:** Confucius and Yan Hui, two sages of worth, cultivated the same body as if clasping arms; yet with daily renewal and swift transformation, firm grasping and steadfast holding cannot pause even for a moment. In the space between clasped arms, one is suddenly gone, the new already proceeding—thus is it lost. If one grieves over such loss, this is deeply lamentable.

**Pronunciation Notes:** *Neng ling* (能令) is read *li cheng*. The same applies in the following chapter’s annotation.

**Annotation:** A pottery market is no place to halt a horse—this speaks of seeking what once existed but can no longer be obtained. Human life is like a horse passing through a market, never pausing even for an instant; the succession of old and new continues unceasing, day and night. *Zhuo* (着) means "to see"—it says you are perilously close to what I see. What I see is daily renewal, and thus it has already ended; how can you still possess it?

**Commentary:** *Dai* (殆) means "near." *Zhuo* (着) means "to see." *Tang* (唐) means "road"; *si* (肆) means "market." What I see is the daily renewal of the old. Yan Hui and Confucius, speaking face-to-face in pure conversation, were not far from the principles of the past—thus it is said they were perilously close. Those past affairs have already vanished; yet you still seek what once existed, believing it remains in the present—this is what is meant by seeking a horse in a pottery market. A pottery market is no place to halt a horse; the horse you saw before has already passed through the road and market, and now, when you search again, it is gone. It is just like the traces of the past, which have vanished ahead, and when sought in the present, the thing has already transformed. Thus we know that the new never abides, and movement ceaselessly shifts.

**Pronunciation Notes:** *Nü* (女) is read *ru*. *Dai zhuo hu wu suo yi zhuo ye* (殆着乎吾所以着也): Guo reads *zhuo* as *zhang lü*; the annotation is the same. Another reading is *zhang lüe*. Sima says: What I am attached to is external transformation, and you are perilously close to this. What I alone do not transform is beyond your reach. *Shi qiu ma yu Tang si ye* (是求马于唐肆也): Guo says: A pottery market is no place to halt a horse. Li concurs. Another says: *Tang* means "inn." Sima writes it as *guang si* (广肆), glossing it as "broad courtyard"—to seek a horse in a market’s broad courtyard is not its proper place. *Ma chu* (马处) is read *chang lü*. *Ke fu* (可复) is read *fu you*. *Bu she* (不舍) is read *she*.

**Annotation:** *Fu* (服) means "to dwell in thought." *Shen wang* (甚忘) refers to the speed of passing—it says you depart suddenly, and in thinking of you, I am always left behind.

**Commentary:** *Fu* (复) means "to reflect and think." The you of before has already passed, and when I reflect on it again, I too have utterly forgotten.

**Annotation:** It is the same for all—whether worthy or sage, none can make it halt.

**Commentary:** Daily renewal does not distinguish between worthy and sage. Not only in you, but in me as well: when you think of me, the past affair has already vanished.

**Annotation:** What cannot be forgotten abides—this refers to succession through daily renewal. Though you forget the old me, the new me has already arrived; it has never ceased to be me, so why should I be concerned? Thus one can leave the vulgar world and transcend dust, merging with all things without obstruction.

**Commentary:** The Dao of transformation never pauses even for a moment. Though the old me is lost, the new me still remains—this is what cannot be forgotten abiding within. Thus it has never ceased to be me; why should you be concerned?

**Pronunciation Notes:** *Li su* (离俗) is read *li zhi*. The same applies in the following chapter’s text.

The collation notes:
(1) The Tang manuscript omits the character *gu* (故).
(2) Wang Shumin states: *Zhi bi* (执臂) should read *jiao bi* (交臂).
(3) Liu Wendian states: *Fu* (复) should follow the main text and read *fu* (服).

Confucius visited Lao Dan. Lao Dan had just washed his hair and was letting it loose to dry. He stood so still and serene that he seemed no longer human. Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he saw Lao Dan again and said: “Was I deluded, or was it truly so? Just now, Master, your form stood as if a withered tree, as though you had left all things and departed from humanity, standing alone in solitude.”

**Annotation:** The utmost stillness and tranquility.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Bei fa* (被发) is read *pi ji* (皮寄).
*Er gan* (而干) in some versions reads *gan* (干).
*Zhi* (慹) is read *nai die* (乃牒) or *ding li* (丁立). Sima Biao says: “the appearance of immobility.” The *Shuowen* says: “fear.”
*Bo* (泊) is read *bu ge* (步各).

**Annotation:** Only when body and mind are absent do external things depart.

**Commentary:** Having just washed his hair, he let it loose to dry, gathering his spirit in profound stillness. Motionless as a withered tree, he seemed no longer human. Seeing this, Confucius dared not approach but withdrew to a distance and waited quietly.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Bian er dai* (便而待) in some versions reads *shi* (侍).

**Commentary:** In that brief moment, Confucius entered and saw Laozi, saying: “When I saw you, Master, my eyes were dazzled, and I forgot both form and intellect—truly a sage! Yet now you stand apart from humanity, having abandoned all things, vanished into the unfathomable, and merged with solitary transformation.”

**Pronunciation Notes:**
*Jian yue* (见曰) is read *xian bian* (贤遍).

《眩》*Xuàn*, read *xuánbiàn*. 《与》pronounced *yú*. Same below. 《掘若》*Xū*, read *qū*. 《槁木》*gǎo mù*, read *kǔlǎo*. **Textual Note:** (1) The character *jué* (掘) is amended according to the main text.

Laozi said: “I roam my mind in the origin of things.”

**Commentary:** The origin is that which was not and then suddenly is. Thus, to roam in the origin of things is to clarify that things do not act to bring themselves into being but arise spontaneously.

**Subcommentary:** The origin is the root. The Dao pervades and gives life to the myriad things, hence it is called the origin of things. To roam the mind in the origin of things is to concentrate the spirit in the wondrous root, so that the form becomes like withered wood and the mind like dead ashes.

**Pronunciation Notes:**
《而欻》*ér xū*, read *xùnfú*.

Confucius said: “What does this mean?”

**Subcommentary:** Though he had heard the sage’s words, he did not yet grasp their meaning.

Laozi said: “The mind is exhausted and cannot know; the mouth is shut and cannot speak. I have tried to discuss it for you in terms of its manifestations. Supreme yin is solemn and still; supreme yang blazes and flourishes. Solemn stillness emerges from heaven; blazing flourishing arises from earth. The two intermingle and harmonize, and things are born. Some structure governs this, yet none see its form. It waxes and wanes, fills and empties, now dark, now bright, changing day by day and month by month. Daily it acts, yet none see its work. Life has that from which it sprouts; death has that to which it returns. Beginning and end revolve without end, yet none know where it ceases. If not this, then what else could be its source?”

The desire was to compel Confucius to seek beyond words and meaning. "Shut" means the mouth opens but does not close. The sage’s mind is not incapable of knowing, but there is no method by which it may be known; the mouth is not incapable of speech, but there is no method by which it may be spoken. To speak of it is to depart from its essence; to know it is to lose its truth. Thus we know the supreme Dao is profoundly mysterious, transcending words and meaning—hence his perplexity and silence.

I have merely attempted to discuss yin and yang as an analogy for what has no form, though I dare not claim certainty. The ultimate principle is wondrously subtle, beyond the reach of words or thought. I have tried to discuss yin and yang for you, sketching an image of the great Dao, yet though it resembles the truth, it is not the truth itself.

It speaks of their intermingling. Solemn stillness is the cold of yin qi; blazing flourishing is the heat of yang qi. They draw near to yang within yin and yin within yang, speaking of their harmonious union. Though some structure governs this, none see the form of that structure—it is simply so of itself. Yin wanes and yang waxes, summer fills and winter empties, night darkens and day brightens, changing day by day and month by month, ever renewing without cease—thus it acts daily. Yet it acts of itself, and none see its work. It sprouts from what is not yet gathered. It returns to dispersion. It returns to what is not yet born. Beginning and end revolve without end, as what meets it does not see its head, and what follows it does not see its tail. If not this, then what else could be its source? If not this vast, unobstructed, life-generating Dao, what else could be the root and origin of the ten thousand things? All things, in their multiplicity, depend upon the Dao.

Confucius said: “May I ask about wandering in this?”

He asked: “If one wanders the mind in the Dao, what is its method? If one attains this wandering, what power does it yield?”

Laozi said: “To attain this is the utmost beauty and utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy is called the perfected person.”

The utmost beauty is without beauty; the utmost joy is without joy. To realize the Dao, to find beauty and delight in it, and to wander the mind in joy without joy—this is the perfected person.

Confucius said: “I would hear of its method.”

The method is this: beasts that feed on grass do not resent changing marshes, nor do creatures born in water resent changing waters. They undergo small changes yet do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight do not enter their breasts.

The world is that in which the ten thousand things are one. If one attains this oneness and becomes identical with it, then the four limbs and hundred parts of the body will be but dust and grime, and death and life, end and beginning will be as day and night—none can disturb them. How much less could gain and loss, fortune and misfortune intrude!

To cast off what is servile is like casting off mud and mire, for one knows the body is nobler than what is servile. What is noble resides within me and is not lost amid change.

Moreover, the ten thousand transformations have never yet reached their limit—what is there to trouble the heart? Those who have become the Dao are released from this.

Confucius said: “The Master’s virtue matched Heaven and Earth, yet he still relied on profound words to cultivate the heart—among the noble men of antiquity, who could escape this?”

Laozi said: “Not so. Water in its stillness requires no effort, for its nature is spontaneous. The perfected person in their virtue needs no cultivation, yet things cannot depart from them—just as Heaven is naturally high, Earth naturally thick, and the sun and moon naturally bright. What cultivation is there to speak of?”

The virtue of the perfected person is not cultivated or contrived, yet it is spontaneously realized. Stillness in water is its inherent nature; drawing from it for benefit does not come from study or practice. The profound virtue of the perfected person is likewise: they remain serene in lofty seclusion, yet things cannot depart from them, their blessings extending to all beings without conscious effort. Like Heaven’s height, Earth’s depth, and the luminosity of the sun and moon—what cultivation is there? It is simply the natural state.

Confucius went out and told Yan Hui, “In my relation to the Dao, am I not like a vinegar gnat? Had the Master not lifted my covering, I would never have known the great wholeness of Heaven and Earth.”

*[Annotation: A vinegar gnat is a midge in a jar.]*
*[Exegesis: "Xī-jī" (酰鸡), pronounced "xǔ-xī" in the *Shuōwén*; Guo Xiang says it is a midge in a jar. Sima Biao says it is like the midges that fly above wine. Yu Yue’s note in the *Taiping Yulan* (395) cites Sima Biao: "Xī-jī are flying gnats above wine," slightly differing from the *Exegesis*. "Jar" (瓮) is pronounced "wēng-lòng"; "mèi" (蠛) is pronounced "míng-jié"; "měng" (蠓) is pronounced "wú-kǒng."]*

*[Annotation: Comparing my wholeness to that of Lao Dan is like comparing a jar to Heaven and Earth.]*
*[Exegesis: Vinegar gnats are midges in a vinegar jar, always hidden beneath the jar’s cover, thus unable to see the two poles of Heaven and Earth. Just so, Confucius was obscured by the traces of the sages, unable to perceive the principles of things. Had Laozi not lifted the covering, he would have remained ignorant of the great wholeness of Heaven and Earth and the wondrous Dao of emptiness and penetration.]*

Zhuangzi had an audience with Duke Ai of Lu.
The Duke said, “In Lu, there are many Confucians, but few who follow your Way.”

*[Exegesis: "Way" (方) means method. Zhuangzi lived during the Warring States period, contemporaneous with King Hui of Wei and King Wei of Qi, 120 years after Duke Ai of Lu. That he is said to have met Duke Ai is merely a parable. However, Lu was the successor state of the Duke of Zhou and should have been a land of ritual and refinement. Moreover, Confucius, who was born in Lu, vigorously promoted the teaching of the Five Virtues, so that his disciples numbered three thousand, all clad in Confucian robes with long hems and wide sleeves. Thus, Lu must have had many such men, while those who practiced the effortless Way were rare.]*

*[Exegesis: "Zhuangzi had an audience" is pronounced "xián-biàn" or read as written. "Duke Ai of Lu": Sima Biao says Zhuangzi was contemporaneous with King Hui of Wei and King Wei of Qi, 120 years after Duke Ai.]*

Zhuangzi said, “In Lu, there are few Confucians.”

*[Exegesis: Robes symbolize virtue; one should not change them lightly. Zhuangzi, with his profound understanding, thus mocked the scarcity of true Confucians.]*

The Duke said, “Yet the whole state of Lu wears Confucian robes—how can you say there are few?”

*[Exegesis: Duke Ai, being mediocre and dull, failed to examine their Way and merely judged by their attire, mistakenly claiming there were many Confucians.]*

Zhuangzi said, “I have heard that Confucians wear round caps to know the seasons of Heaven, square shoes to know the forms of Earth, and jade pendants with loose girdles to decide matters as they arise. A noble person who possesses the Way may not wear such robes, while one who wears such robes may not know the Way. If you truly do not believe this, why not issue a decree throughout the state: ‘Those who wear these robes without possessing the Way shall be put to death!’”

*[Exegesis: "Square" (句) means angular.]*

The term "缓" refers to multicolored silk cords used to thread jade *jue* pendants as ornamental girdle decorations. *Jue* means "to decide." Some texts also write this as "绶." Now, Heaven is round and Earth is square, and attire is worn to emulate their virtue. Thus, wearing a round cap to emulate Heaven enables one to know the auspicious and inauspicious signs of the Three Luminaries; wearing square shoes to model Earth enables one to know the water and land of the Nine Provinces; and trailing silk cords with *jue* pendants allows one to make decisions when matters arise. Therefore, those who embody the Way need not don such robes, while those who wear such robes need not embody the Way. Such individuals—both past and present—have always existed, which is why Master Zhuang employed parables and dialectical discourse.

*[Phonetic Glosses:]*
《冠》: *guan* (ancient reading: *gwan*)
《圜冠》: *yuan guan* (pronounced *yuan*)
《履句》: *ju ju* (pronounced *ju*; Xu reads *qi ju*)
Li [Yun] says: "square."
《屦》: Xu reads *ju* (as in *ju bei*)
《缓》: *huan* (read *hwan*)
Sima’s version writes *shou* (silk sash).
《佩玦》: *pei jue* (ancient reading: *gwat*)
◎Qingfan’s note: The *Shuowen* defines *xuan* and *jue* interchangeably; *huan* conveys a sense of spaciousness. The *Book of Jin* states, "loose sashes and light furs," where "loose sashes" means broad sashes. *Huan pei jue* describes the *jue* as the ornament worn, suspended from the belt with ample slack. The *Shiwen*’s citation of Sima’s version as *shou* is erroneous.
《而断》: *er duan* (read *dwan*)

Thus, Duke Ai issued a decree for five days, and no one in the state of Lu dared don Confucian garb. Only one man, clad in Confucian robes, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs; his responses were inexhaustible, shifting a thousandfold yet never at a loss.

*[Annotation:]*
To wear the robes without embodying the Dao is a crime deserving the harshest penalty. With the law so severe, none dared violate it. After five days of decrees, not a single Confucian remained.

*[Phonetic Gloss:]*
《号于国》: *hao* (to issue decrees)

Zhuangzi said: "With the whole state of Lu, only one man is a Confucian—can this be called many?"

*[Annotation:]*
One whose virtue is full within does not adorn himself without.

*[Annotation:]*
This "one man" refers to Confucius. As a sage, Confucius responded to circumstances with wisdom, like a mirror reflecting all—his transformations were boundless. That the entire state had but one such man cannot be called many.

Baili Xi took no heed of rank or emolument, which is why, though he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance.

*[Annotation:]*
Surnamed Meng, styled Baili Xi, he was a worthy of Qin. Originally a man of Yu, when Yu was destroyed by Jin, he entered Qin. Initially unrecognized, he lived in poverty, feeding cattle. Content with his lot, he remained robust and joyful, unmoved by wealth or nobility, so rank and emolument never entered his heart. Later, Duke Mu, recognizing his worth, entrusted him with state affairs without suspicion, hence "forgot his lowly status."

*[Phonetic Gloss:]*
《故饭》: *fan* (read *fwan*)
《忘其贱与之政也》: refers to forgetting his lowly status as a cattle-feeder.

The Lord of Yu took no heed of life or death, which is why he could move others.

*[Annotation:]*
One who is self-sufficient within keeps external affairs whole.

*[Annotation:]*
The Lord of Yu was Shun, surnamed Gui, styled Chonghua. Though beset by his stepmother’s trials and repeatedly thwarted, he never let life or death weigh on his heart. His filial piety was renowned, moving even Heaven and Earth. Thus, Yao wed him to his two daughters and entrusted him with the realm—hence he could move others.

When the Lord of Song was about to commission a painting, all the scribes arrived, received his bow, and stood in attendance. They licked their brushes and mixed ink, but half remained outside.

*[Annotation:]*
The Lord of Song wished to have maps of his state’s mountains and lands painted. The scribes all arrived, received his command, bowed, and stood ready. They prepared their pigments and ink, vying to display their skill. Excluding those who had bowed, half remained outside—so many were eager to compete.

*[Phonetic Gloss:]*
《受揖而立》: Sima [Biao] says: they received his command, bowed, and stood.
《舐》: Some versions write *shi* (read *shih*).

One scribe arrived late, strolling leisurely without haste. He received the bow but did not stand, then went straight to his quarters. The Duke sent someone to observe him, and he was found sitting with his robes undone, bare-chested. The Duke said: "This is the one—he is a true painter."

*[Annotation:]*
One who is sufficient within is at ease in spirit and settled in mind.

*[Annotation:]*
*Chanchran* describes his unhurried demeanor. Self-sufficient within, he showed no outward restraint. He walked slowly without haste, received the command but did not stand, entered his quarters directly, sat with his robes undone, and bared his body without fear. Seeing his spirit and bearing, the Lord of Song declared him a true painter.

*[Phonetic Gloss:]*
《儃儃》: *chantran* (read *thran*); Xu reads *dan*. Li [Yun] says: it describes a relaxed, unhurried appearance.
《般》: The character is also written as *pan*.
《礡》: *bok* (read *pok*); Xu reads *fok*. Sima [Biao] says: *banbok* means sitting with legs spread.
《裸》: Also written as *lei* (same pronunciation). Sima [Biao] says: he undid his robes to reveal his form for painting.
《神闲》: *shen xian* (read *shyen*)

*[Textual Note:]*
(1) Zhao’s remonstrance edition writes *ban* as *pan*.
(2) The original *Shiwen* text had a corrupted character, which should be *shi*.

The *Shuowen* writes: "𠵁, meaning 'to take food with the tongue.'" It is composed of "tongue" (舌) with *yi* (易) as phonetic. Pronounced *shen zhi* (神旨). Some versions write it with *ye* (也).

King Wen observed at Zang and saw a man fishing, yet his fishing was no fishing. It was not that he held his rod with intent to fish, but that he fished habitually.

*[Note 1]* Merely to pass the years.
*[Exegesis]* Zang is a place name near the Wei River. The "man" is an allegory for the Grand Duke. Before Lü Wang encountered King Wen, he angled at Zang, casting his line without bait, idly passing his days in carefree ease.

*[Phonetic Gloss:]*
《文王观于臧》 Li [Yun] says: Zang is a place name. Sima [Biao] writes: "King Wen, in plain clothes, observed at Zang."
《丈夫》 Some versions write it as *zhangren* (old man).

*[Note 2]* Ultimately seeking nothing.
*[Note 3]* Unconcerned with gain or loss, merely feigning to fish.
*[Exegesis]* He did not grasp his rod with the intent to covet fish, but roamed the banks of the Wei, merely passing the years. King Wen wished to raise him and entrust him with governance, yet feared the ministers, fathers, and elder brothers would not accept it. He wished to abandon the idea and release him, yet could not bear the people’s lack of a lord.

At dawn, he gathered his ministers and said: "Last night, I dreamt of a worthy man—his complexion dark, his beard full—riding a dappled horse with one crimson hoof. He commanded: *'Entrust your governance to the old man of Zang, and the people’s afflictions may yet be healed!'*"

*[Exegesis 1]* King Wen, having encountered the worthy man and wishing to entrust him with state affairs, feared that the royal kin and chief ministers would grow suspicious and envious. Yet if he were to abandon the idea and release him, he could not bear the thought of the common folk left without shelter.

*[Exegesis 2]* Desiring to employ the worthy, he thus ascribed it to a dream, addressing his assembled ministers: "Last night, I dreamt of a man of virtue—his complexion dark, his beard full—riding a dappled horse with one crimson hoof. He commanded me: *'Entrust your governance to the old man of Zang. By honoring the worthy and advancing the reclusive, the people’s desolation and disorder shall surely be cured.'*" *Dappled* is also written as *xing*; read according to the character.

*[Phonetic Gloss]*
《旦而属》 Pronounced *zhú*.
《之夫夫》 Both read *fú* (as in *fǔyú*).
Sima [Biao] says: *Fufu* means "ministers." Another version: *Fufu* was read as "ministers" in antiquity.
◎ Qingfan’s note: *Xizhe* means "night." In ancient times, night was called *xi*. Some versions write *xi zhe* (e.g., *Yanzi Chunqiu: Za Xia* has "the owl *xi zhe* cried"; *Shuo Yuan: Bian Wu* also writes *xi zhe*), others *ye zhe* (e.g., *Yanzi Chunqiu: Wai Pian*: "I *ye zhe* heard a man weeping in the west"; since night is called *ye zhe*, day is likewise called *zhou zhe*, as in *Yanzi Chunqiu: Za Shang*: "*Zhou zhe* the meal was served"), and still others *xi zhe* (e.g., *Yanzi Chunqiu: Xia Pian*: "*Xi zhe* Meng fought with the two suns").
《》 Pronounced *ér zhān*; Guo [Xiang] and Li [Yi] read *ér jiān*; also *ér xián*.
《驳马》 Pronounced *bāng jué*.
《偏朱蹄》 Li [Yi] says: "One hoof was crimson."
《瘳乎》 Pronounced *chì liú*.

*[Textual Note]* *Fufu* in modern texts is written as "ministers."

The ministers, startled, exclaimed: "It was the late king!"

The father of King Wen, Jili, in his lifetime had a dark complexion and abundant whiskers, and favored riding piebald horses—horses whose hooves were crimson on one side. What the king dreamed was none other than his late father’s instruction to him, which is why the ministers were so startled and fearful.

*[Pronunciation Note]*
《蹴然》 *zǐ liù* (反切); some versions write *愀*, pronounced *qǐ* (七小二反).
《先君王也》 Sima [Biao] says: "This refers to the spiritual influence of the late king."

◎ Yu Yue says: Below *先君* ("late ruler"), the character *命* ("command") is likely missing. The original text should read *先君命王也* ("the late ruler commanded the king"), which aligns with the following line: "the late ruler’s command to the king—let there be no other."

King Wen said: "Then let us divine it."
The ministers replied: "The late ruler’s command leaves no room for doubt—why divine at all?"

*[Annotation]* This was the late ruler’s decree, decisive and unquestionable. Divination is for resolving doubts; where there is no doubt, why divine?

*[Pronunciation Note]*
《之令》 Some versions write *命* ("command").
◎ Lu Wenchang says: The modern text writes *命*.
《王其无它》 Sima [Biao] says: "Do not disobey the command."

Thereupon, they welcomed the Elder of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No laws were altered, and no partial decrees were issued.

After three years, King Wen surveyed the state and found that the ranks of scholars had abandoned factionalism and dispersed their cliques; high officials no longer cultivated personal virtue; and grain measures dared not enter the four borders. When the ranks of scholars abandoned factionalism and dispersed their cliques, it showed unity of purpose. When high officials no longer cultivated personal virtue, it showed shared endeavor. When grain measures dared not enter the four borders, it showed that the feudal lords harbored no divided loyalties.

*[Annotation]* In harmonious accord between ruler and ministers, they welcomed the Elder and appointed him as chief minister, entrusting him with state affairs. Thus, the statutes and penal codes were uniformly applied without change, and no partial or biased decrees were issued.

The term *zhi* (植) denotes ranks or formations; it also refers to border stations arranged in rows to receive memorials of remonstrance, or to lodgings for remonstrance officials. *Yu* (庾) measures six *dou* and four *sheng*. After three years of governance, customs were transformed and mores altered; ruler and ministers trod the Way, leaving no room for admonition or correction. Thus, the ranks of scholars’ titles were abolished, the lodgings for memorials of remonstrance dismantled, and all between high and low prospered. High officials no longer displayed their virtue, while near and far followed the same track, and measures of grain dared not enter the four borders.

*[Pronunciation Notes]*
*Lie shi huai* (列士坏) is read as *guài*.
*Zhi* (植) is read as *zhí*.
*Sǎn qún* (散群): Sima [Biao] explains: *zhi* means ranks; *sǎn qún* means they no longer maintained followers. Another interpretation: *zhi* refers to border stations where lodgings were constructed in clusters to await remonstrators.
◎ Yu Yue remarks: Neither of Sima’s explanations captures the meaning of *zhi*. In the *Zuozhuan* (Year 2 of Duke Xuan), when Hua Yuan served as *zhi*, Du Yu’s commentary states: *zhi* means the commanding leader. The ranks of scholars must first have a leader before they can gather followers; thus, to disperse their followers, one must first dismantle their leader.
*Cháng* (长) is read as *zhàng*. The same applies below.

The *Officials Fail to Perfect Virtue*: Sima [Biao] explains: "They do not benefit from merit or fame."
*Yǔ hú* (斔斛) is read as *yǔ*. Li [Xun] states: Six *hu* and four *dou* are called *yǔ*. Sima’s text reads *yǔ yǔ*, explaining: *Yǔ* is read as *zhōng*, and *yǔ* is read as *yú*.
*Four Borders* (四竟) is read as *jìng*. The same applies below.

**[3]** *[Annotation]* This refers to harmonizing one’s light and blending with the dust.
**[4]** *[Annotation]* Maintaining purity and self-completion sets one apart from worldly affairs.
**[5]** *[Annotation]* The world places its trust in him, thus he unifies the standards of weights and measures.

*[Exegesis]* When the world achieves great unity, loyalty and remonstrance cease to compete; affairs know no division, and thus virtue remains unmanifest. When the five ranks observe their duties, the four directions enjoy tranquility. King Wen thereupon appointed him Grand Preceptor, faced north, and inquired: "Can governance extend to all under heaven?" Master Zang remained silent and unresponsive, then vaguely declined. By morning’s decree, he fled by night, and for the rest of his life, no word of him was heard.

**[1]** *[Annotation]* One who acts for the sake of achievement is not the self; thus, when the task is accomplished, the person must withdraw. When affairs are settled, the name must depart. Only when name departs and self withdraws can one extend influence to all under heaven.

*[Exegesis]* In an instant, [King Wen] bowed to him as teacher and mentor, facing north to serve him and inquire about governance. [Master Zang], unmoved by honor or favor, thus vaguely declined; his hidden intent dissolved all clamor, so he remained silent and unresponsive. Having achieved fame, he withdrew, attributing success to others. Unwilling to extend his influence to all under heaven, he fled and vanished without trace. Yet Lü [Shang], who aided the Zhou house and was enfeoffed in Qi, appears in historical records with no sign of flight—this claim of nocturnal escape is but Zhuangzi’s allegory.

*[Pronunciation Notes]*
*Grand Preceptor* (大师) is read as *tàishī*.
*Silent* (昧然) is read as *mèirán*.

《泛然》 reads *xūfūjiànfǎn*.
*Night flight* (夜遁) reads *túkùnfǎn*.
*[Collation]* Zhao Jianyì’s edition omits the character *也*.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, “Was King Wen perhaps still not [fully realized]? Why then did he dream?”
*[Exegesis]* Yanzi doubted whether King Wen had attained the ultimate virtue of the perfected person. The true person does not dream—why then did he dream?

Confucius said, “Silence! Say no more! King Wen fulfilled it—what criticism could there be? He merely followed the momentary [needs of the people].”
*[Commentary]* Entrusting all to his ministers without claiming authority for himself—this was fulfillment.
*[Commentary]* *The momentary* refers to the people’s feelings, the interval between awakening and unawareness. Thus King Wen followed and aroused them to align with their great nature.
*[Exegesis]* *The momentary* means a brief instant. *Followed* means to comply. King Wen, a sage, fully embodied the subtle principle. You should remain silent and not trouble yourself with criticism. He simply accorded with the nature of things, aligning with the people’s hopes. In the fleeting interval between their awakening and unawareness, in the instant of advance or retreat, he used dreams to stir their nature—nothing strange in that.

*[Pronunciation Notes]*
*Criticism* (刺焉) reads *qìyān*.

Lie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to full draw,
*[Commentary]* *Full draw* means the arrowhead reaches the bow’s limit.
placing a cup of water on his elbow.
The arrows flew in succession,
*[Commentary]* *Succession* means one arrow follows another.
and as each was loosed, another took its place.
*[Commentary]* *Took its place* means the next arrow was nocked.
At that moment, he was like a wooden figure.
*[Pronunciation Notes]*
*For Bohun* (为伯昏) reads *wéibóhūn*.
*Full draw* (盈贯) reads *yíngguàn*.
Sima [Biao] says: *the arrowhead*.
*Arrowhead* (镝) reads *dílì*.

The left hand was as if pushing against stone, the right hand as if clinging to a branch. The right hand released the shot while the left hand remained unaware—thus the cup of water could be placed there.

*[Commentary]*
Lie Yukou and Bohun Wuren are fully explained in the Inner Chapters. *Full draw* means the arrowhead is fully nocked. *Placed* means set down. Lie Yukou, an immortal of the wind and a master archer of Zheng, drew the bow with his right hand as if clinging to a branch, the arrowhead fully drawn, while his left hand stood firm as if pushing against stone. The cup of water was set upon his elbow, demonstrating the utmost steadiness and swiftness.

*[Pronunciation Notes]*
*Placed* (措) reads *qìgù*. *His elbow* (其肘) reads *zhújiǔ*. *Like pushing* (如拒) sounds *jù*; some texts write it as 矩.

The arrow flew away. As one arrow departed, another followed in succession.

*[Pronunciation Notes]*
*Arrow flew* (适矢) reads *dílì*. *Followed in succession* (复沓) reads *fúyòu*; the same applies below. *Succession* (歃) reads *sèqià* or *chūqià*.

The arrow had just been loosed and not yet reached the target when the cup was again placed upon the elbow, demonstrating the marvel of his swiftness.

*[Commentary]*
*Departed* (适) means went forth. *Succession* (沓) means repeated. *Placed* (寓) means set down. The bowstring was loosed, the arrow flew forth, and another followed in rapid succession—this is what is meant by "splitting the nock and entering." The arrow had just been shot and not yet reached the target when the cup of water was again placed upon the elbow, showing his swiftness. The character *寓* may also be written as *隅*, referring to the round arrowhead repeatedly striking the square nock, fully entering the slot and lodging in the corner.

He was utterly motionless.

*[Commentary]*
*Utterly motionless* means the pinnacle of stillness. *Wooden figure* refers to a wooden or clay puppet. This says that when Lie Yukou shot, he was so still that he resembled a figure of earth or wood.

◎ Jia Shifu says: *The arrow flew away, followed in succession* describes the release of the arrows; *the arrow had just been loosed, again placed* describes the drawing of the bow.

The *Shuowen* states: "Much speech flows *tàtà*, like water in its course." This describes one arrow just loosed as another surges forth. *寓* means "to lodge," signifying that as one arrow is released, another is already drawn in the bow.

*象人* is akin to Zheng Kangcheng’s term *xiangren’ou* (wooden figurine).

Bo Hun Wu Ren said: "This is the shooting of one who shoots—it is not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Have I not once ascended a high mountain with you, trodden upon perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of a ravine a hundred *ren* deep? Could you shoot then?"

*[Commentary]*
This means that though your skill is refined, it remains the shooting of intention—it is not the effortless, unintentional shooting of one who does not shoot.

*[Commentary]*
A *ren* is seven *chi*; seven hundred *chi* is the depth. *若* means "you." This is the shooting of one who does not shoot.

Thereupon Wu Ren ascended the high mountain, trod upon the perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of the ravine a hundred *ren* deep. Turning his back to the abyss, he retreated step by step, with two parts of his feet hanging over the void. He bowed to Lie Yukou and beckoned him forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself upon the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

*[Commentary]*
Earlier, he briefly expounded the meaning of shooting; here, he directly prepares to draw the bow. *逡巡* means to step backward. *进* means to yield. Having climbed the towering mountain, trodden upon the precarious rocks, and stood at the brink of the sheer abyss, he turns his back to the chasm and retreats, with two parts of his feet suspended in empty space. Yet he draws the bowstring as if at ease, bows to Lie Yukou, and yields to him. Overcome with terror, Lie Yukou cannot lift his head; he shuts his eyes, prostrates himself upon the ground, and sweats until it flows down to his feet.

*[Phonetic Gloss]*
*《逡巡》* is read *qūnxún* (seven-*xún* tone).
*《汗流》* is read *hànliú* (house-*dàn* tone).

Bohun Wuren said: "The perfected person peers upward into the azure heavens, plunges downward into the Yellow Springs, roams and ranges to the eight limits, yet his spirit and qi remain unaltered. Now you tremble with the intent to dazzle the eyes—how perilous this is for your shot!"

Shoulder Wu asked Sunshu Ao: "You have thrice served as Prime Minister without vaunting glory, thrice been dismissed without a troubled countenance. At first I doubted you, but now I see the radiant ease between your brows—how do you alone cultivate your mind thus?"

Sunshu Ao replied: "How do I surpass others? I know that what comes cannot be refused, what departs cannot be halted. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and so remain free of troubled countenance. How do I surpass others? Moreover, how can I know whether it lies in them or in me? If it lies in them, it is lost to me; if it lies in me, it is lost to them. I am just now lingering in hesitation, just now casting my gaze all around—how could I find leisure to attend to whether men are noble or base?"

Confucius, having heard this, said: "The true persons of antiquity—sages could not sway them with eloquence, beauties could not seduce them with excess, bandits could not plunder them by force, and even Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor could not befriend them. Death and life are indeed momentous, yet they wrought no change within themselves—how much less could rank and emolument! Such as these: their spirit threaded through the great mountains without obstruction, plunged into the abyssal springs without wetting, dwelt in lowliness and obscurity without weariness, filled heaven and earth, and even after bestowing all upon others, themselves possessed still more."

Fu Xi, pronounced as Xi.

Though people daily renew themselves, death and life are indeed momentous, yet they wrought no change within themselves—how much less could rank and emolument engage their hearts! To carve one’s flesh for the sake of the world is for both self and others to lose; to enable each person to find their own fulfillment is to give to others without diminishing oneself. Their spirit and luminosity filled heaven and earth, thus wherever they dwelt was fitting; wherever they dwelt was fitting, thus they did not diminish themselves for things but abided in the realm of self-fulfillment.

Obstruction means hindrance. *Ji* means exhaustion. The true person enters fire without burning, enters water without wetting, traverses the great mountains with spirit unobstructed, dwells in lowliness and obscurity without weariness, their virtue harmonizing with the two poles, thus filling heaven and earth. Not diminishing themselves for things, they possessed still more.

The King of Chu sat with the Lord of Fan. After a short while, those beside the King of Chu said three times that Fan was perishing. The Lord of Fan said: "That Fan is perishing does not suffice to lose what I possess. If 'Fan’s perishing does not suffice to lose what I possess,' then Chu’s existence does not suffice to preserve existence. From this perspective, Fan has never truly perished, and Chu has never truly existed."

This refers to three signs of perishing.

King Wen of Chu sat together with the Marquis of Fan to discuss alliances and covenants. Fan was the name of a state, descended from the Duke of Zhou, located within the borders of Ji Commandery; the present-day Fan City remains. The three referred to disrespect for spirits, failure to honor the worthy, and neglect of the people. Since Chu was large and Fan small, Chu harbored intentions of annexation, prompting its attendants to speak thus.

Yu Yue said: The attendants of the King of Chu spoke of three people from Fan perishing. Guo Xiang’s note, "This refers to three signs of perishing," is incorrect.

The self-attains the transformations of creation, content and unafraid—truly the descendants of the Duke of Zhou, whose generations never lack the worthy.

What abandons them does not take perishing as perishing, so existence also does not suffice to be taken as existence. Only in vastness without self-importance does one abide in constant presence.

Existence and perishing lie solely in where the heart places its concern; in the world, there is ultimately no existence or perishing.

Existence and perishing are but the heart’s gains and losses. Once obscured to gains and losses, the perished are not necessarily perished and may instead abide, while the existent do not alone exist and may instead perish.

**Outer Chapters: "Knowledge Wanders North" (Chapter Twenty-Two)**

Knowledge wandered north to the banks of the Dark Waters, ascended the Hidden Mound, and there by chance encountered Non-Action Spoken. Knowledge said to Non-Action Spoken: “I wish to ask you: What thoughts, what reflections lead to knowing the Dao? What dwelling, what practice lead to resting in the Dao? What following, what path lead to attaining the Dao?” Three questions, yet Non-Action Spoken gave no answer—not that he refused to answer, but that he did not know how to answer.

Knowledge, receiving no answer, returned to the south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Terrace, and there beheld Mad Qu. Knowledge repeated his questions to Mad Qu. Mad Qu said: “Ah! I know it—I was about to tell you, but midway I forgot what I wished to say.”

Knowledge, receiving no answer, returned to the Celestial Palace, saw the Yellow Emperor, and asked him. The Yellow Emperor said: “With no thoughts, no reflections, one begins to know the Dao. With no dwelling, no practice, one begins to rest in the Dao. With no following, no path, one begins to attain the Dao.”

Knowledge asked the Yellow Emperor: “You and I know it, yet those two do not—who is right?” The Yellow Emperor said: “Non-Action Spoken is truly right; Mad Qu resembles him. You and I will never come close. For the knower does not speak, and the speaker does not know—thus the sage enacts the teaching without words. The Dao cannot be attained; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence may be enacted, righteousness may be diminished, and ritual is mutual pretense. Thus it is said: ‘Lose the Dao and then virtue follows; lose virtue and then benevolence follows; lose benevolence and then righteousness follows; lose righteousness and then ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of disorder.’ Thus it is said: ‘One who practices the Dao daily diminishes, diminishes again and again until reaching non-action—with non-action, there is nothing not done.’”

"'Now that one has already become a thing, to seek again to return to the root—is this not difficult! How easy it is—only for the great person!'

[1] To follow its natural course is the teaching without words.
[The commentary:] The true knows not; the semblance forgets the mean. That we do not draw near is because of knowing. Practicing the teaching without words, one cites the *Laozi* as proof.

[2] The Dao abides in spontaneity; it cannot be attained through words.
[The commentary:] To attain is to obtain. The mysterious Dao cannot be obtained through words; to speak of obtaining it is not the Dao.

[3] Not losing virtue is called 'virtue,' yet to name virtue is not to reach it.
[The commentary:] The highest virtue does not act as virtue; to act as virtue is not the ultimate virtue.

[4] The ultimate benevolence has no partiality; what is now practiced as partial benevolence is merely something that can be enacted.

[5] To cut and sever is merely to diminish; it is not the great wholeness. The great wholeness is simply to give life.

[6] Ritual values reciprocity, yet it is mutual pretense—ornamentation that disorders virtue, not truth.

[7] Ritual has fixed norms, and thus arises artificial imitation.
[The commentary:] Abandoning the root to pursue the branches, scattering simplicity for refinement, the Dao is lost and purity dissipated, until one resorts to ritual. Thus, the *Laozi* is cited to confirm this meaning.

[8] To diminish is to shed artificial ornamentation.

[9] When ornamentation is gone and simplicity is whole, then though one acts, it is as if one does not act.
[The commentary:] Those who cultivate the Dao daily diminish artificial ornamentation. First, they diminish what exists; then, they diminish what does not exist. Both existence and non-existence are relinquished, reaching the non-action of neither existence nor non-existence. Serene and unmoving, with non-action, there is nothing not done. This again cites the *Laozi* to clarify the point.

[10] Things lose their proper place, and thus become things.
[The commentary:] Only the great person finds it easy to return to the root. The great person embodies transformation, and thus transforming things is not difficult.
[The commentary:] Inverted beings, with falsity in their hearts, pursue the branches and forget the root, taking the Dao as a thing. If they indulge their desires to return to the root and recover their mandate, how could they succeed? Yet to reverse course and return to the root is not difficult—only for the great sage.

◎ Jia Shifu says: What humans receive to live is qi. Once obtained to form life, qi flows daily within the great transformation, and we, as mere clods, receive its completed form, with no way to return qi and merge with the vast. The flower of the Dao as ritual, and qi’s flowing to become human—neither is what is originally so. To regard life and death as the same, to let qi’s gathering and dispersing proceed without our involvement, is non-action. When the Dao reaches non-action, the names of benevolence, righteousness, and ritual may be set aside—this is called returning to the root."

The living are the companions of death, and death is the beginning of life—who knows their order! Man’s life is the gathering of qi; when it gathers, there is life, and when it scatters, there is death. If death and life are companions, what cause have I for sorrow?

Thus the myriad things are one. What they deem beautiful is called wondrous and divine, while what they despise is called foul and rotten. Yet the foul and rotten transform again into the wondrous and divine, and the wondrous and divine transform again into the foul and rotten. Therefore it is said, “The world through-and-through is but a single qi.” Hence the sage values oneness.

---
**Annotations from the text:**
**[1]** Those who understand the Dao of transformation do not regard death and life as different.
**[2]** Each alternately becomes the beginning, so who can know which is death and which is life?
**[3]** Both are but gathering, both are but scattering.
**[4]** Sorrow arises from seeing them as different.
**[5]** Since death and life are not two, the principle of the myriad things must return to oneness.
**[6]** Each calls what it deems beautiful “wondrous and divine,” and what it despises “foul and rotten.” Yet what one deems beautiful, another may despise, and what one despises, another may deem beautiful. Thus all share in the wondrous and divine, all share in the foul and rotten—how could death and life, self and other, be truly distinct?
**[7]** Things themselves have no beauty or ugliness; it is human sentiment that turns toward or away. What sentiment deems beautiful is called wondrous and divine, while what it deems repulsive is called foul and rotten—thus inverting root and branch to such an extent. Yet natures differ, and preferences vary: what one finds beautiful, another may despise, and what one despises, another may find beautiful. Xi Shi and Mao Qiang are deemed beautiful by humans, yet fish dive deep at the sight of them, and birds take flight. Thus the foul and rotten become wondrous and divine, and the wondrous and divine become foul and rotten—how can there be any fixed standard of right and wrong, beauty and ugliness? Know then that the world’s myriad things are but a single harmonious qi.

**[Fu Hua]**

The sage who embodies the Dao encompasses all transformations with wisdom, thus prizing this true unity and merging indistinguishably with the ten thousand conditions.

Huangdi questioned Know, saying: “I asked Wuweiwei, but Wuweiwei did not respond to me—not that he refused to respond, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Kuang Qu, and Kuang Qu wished to tell me yet did not tell me—not that he refused to tell me, but that in wishing to tell, he forgot. Now I ask you: you know, so why do you not come near?”

Huangdi replied: “He is truly so because he does not know; this one resembles it because he forgets. You and I will never come near because we know.”

Kuang Qu heard this and took Huangdi to have spoken truly.

Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons follow clear patterns yet do not debate; the myriad things fulfill their principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of Heaven and Earth and penetrates the principles of the myriad things—thus the perfected person does nothing, the great sage takes no action, for this is to contemplate Heaven and Earth.

The *Great Beauty* refers to the beauty of covering and bearing.

**[2]**
**[Annotation]** Simply allowing things to be as they are.
**[Subcommentary]** The sage aligns with the covering and bearing of the Two Modes and harmonizes with the generation and completion of the myriad things—thus his mouth utters no words, his heart takes no action.

**[3]**
**[Annotation]** Only following and yielding.
**[4]**
**[Annotation]** Observing its forms, emulating its proper manifestations, no different from Heaven and Earth.

**[Subcommentary]** The great sage and perfected person, doing nothing and taking no action, contemplate the covering and bearing of Heaven and Earth, model themselves on the generation and completion of the supreme Dao—this is what it means to do nothing and say nothing.

Now, that numinous clarity and utmost essence, together with the hundred transformations,
though things die and live, are square and round, none know their root.
Yet all things have existed from of old, naturally so.
The Six Directions are vast, yet never leave its bounds;
the tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet depends on it to complete its form.
Nothing in the world does not sink and float, never remaining the same throughout life;
yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their courses, each keeping to its proper order.
Obscurely, as if absent yet present;
effortlessly, without form yet spirit—
the myriad things are nurtured yet do not know.
This is called the *root*;
by this one may observe Heaven.

**[1]**
**[Annotation]** The hundred transformations transform themselves, and the numinous clarity does not interfere.
**[Subcommentary]** That divine and sagely luminosity, of utmost essence and subtlety, blends with things and flows with transformations—now gathering, now scattering—without joy or sorrow. When speaking of "hundreds" or "thousands," it is merely to indicate the general scope.

**[2]**
**[Annotation]** The dead have already died of themselves, the living have already lived of themselves; the round have already been round of themselves, the square have already been square of themselves. There is no maker of their root, hence none know it.
**[Subcommentary]** Things now live, now die, now square, now round—transforming naturally, none know their root or thread.

**[3]**
**[Annotation]** Do they wait to be made before existing?
**[Subcommentary]** *Pianran* describes the appearance of universal generation. All things arise in their time, flourishing and multiplying; from ancient times they have existed of themselves—how could they depend on deliberate effort to come into being?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Pian* is read as *pian*, also as *fan*.

**[4]**
**[Annotation]** To consider the Six Directions as contained within the boundless is to belittle them.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Wei li* is read as *li zhi*; *qi nei* means unable to depart from self-transformation.

**[5]**
**[Annotation]** Though the tip of an autumn hair is minute, it is not nothing—yet there is no place to contain its substance.
**[Subcommentary]** The Six Directions are Heaven, Earth, and the four quarters. When beasts encounter autumn’s scenery, fine hairs grow at the tips of their fur—this is the *qiu hao*, the tip of an autumn hair. *Ju* means great. Though the Six Directions are vast, they still reside within the supreme Dao; though the hair-tip is minute, it relies on the Dao to complete its form.

**[6]**
**[Annotation]** Ever renewing.
**[Subcommentary]** All things in the world sink and float, rising and falling, living and dying, coming and going without cease. Their movement never stops, ever renewing in succession, never clinging to the old.

**[7]**
**[Annotation]** No need to make them so.
**[Subcommentary]** The two qi intermingle, the four seasons revolve—spring and autumn, cold and heat follow their natural sequence. Do they wait to be made before moving?

**[8]**
**[Annotation]** If it were clearly present as if existing, it would be absent.
**[Subcommentary]** Dimly, as if obscured, seeming absent yet present.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Hunran* is read as *hun*, also as *min*.

**[9]**
**[Annotation]** If it were bound to form, it would not be spirit.
**[Subcommentary]** *Shen* refers to that which subtly pervades all things. Effortlessly unbound, without visible form, its spiritual function is without limit.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Youran* is read as *you*, meaning without attachment or reluctance.

**[10]**
**[Annotation]** Though things are nurtured, their root in original nature is not grasped—hence they do not know how they are nurtured.
**[Subcommentary]** Nurturing and fostering all beings, sustaining the myriad things, its mysterious power works in hidden ways, yet in daily use it goes unnoticed. This true power is the root of the supreme Dao.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Wu xu* is also written as *chu*, both read as *chi liu fan*. The annotation is the same.

**[11]**
**[Annotation]** Observing together with Heaven.
**[Subcommentary]** *Guan* means to see; *tian* means nature. One who penetrates principle and comprehends the mysterious, who knows the root and recognizes the origin, may be said to observe the supreme Dao of nature.

**[Textual Note]** (1) The missing character in *Liu Deyi’s* edition is here supplied as *he* following the version of *Liu Deyi*. (2) The *Zhao Jianyi* edition includes the character *ye* after *zhi*. (3) The character *zhao* follows the *Shi De Tang* edition.

Nie Que asked the Way of Pi Yi.
Pi Yi said: “Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will come to you.
Collect your knowledge, unify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell.
Virtue will become your beauty, the Dao will become your dwelling.
You will gaze in wonder like a newborn calf, seeking no reason for things!”

**[1]**
**[Subcommentary]** Nie Que was a disciple of Wang Ni; Pi Yi was Wang Ni’s teacher. Make your form upright and refined, do not incline toward the perverse; let your seeing and hearing be pure and single, do not take in many objects. Naturally, harmony and principle will come to you.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Pi Yi* is read as *pi*, also written as *pi*.

**[2]**
**[Subcommentary]** Gather and restrain your private thoughts, making them balanced and equal; focus your mind and measures, allowing no dissipation. Then your spirit will naturally come to dwell.
◎ Yu Yue says: *Yi ru du* should be *zheng ru du*. These four lines vary the phrasing but express the same meaning.

Gather in your knowing—this is the intent of unifying your seeing. What you see is singular, thus what you know is gathered in. Make your measures upright—this is the intent of making your form upright. *Du* means "form." The *Daoying* chapter of the *Huainanzi* and the *Daoyuan* chapter of the *Wenzi* both read *zheng ru du*, which may be taken as authoritative for correction.

**[3]**
**[Subcommentary]** Profound and mysterious, the highest virtue flourishes in you; the boundless Dao dwells within your heart.

**[4]**
**[Subcommentary]** *Tongyan* describes the appearance of gazing directly with no knowing. *Gu* means "matter." When the heart is empty and level, seeing too becomes even and straight, thus like a newborn calf, it seeks nothing in matters.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Tong* is read as *chihong*; Guo reads it as *tu*; Li says: "the appearance of having no knowing." Before the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Pi Yi was greatly pleased, and departed singing, saying:

**[1]**
"Form like withered bones,
heart like dead ashes,
true in its actual knowing,
not clinging to the old to sustain itself.

**[2]**
Vague and dim,
without mind, unfit for plotting—
what manner of man is he!"

**[3]**

**[1]**
**[Subcommentary]** Before the discourse on the mysterious had concluded, this man had already awakened—sitting in forgetfulness, he merged with the Dao, his state no different from sleep. Thereupon, Pi Yi leapt with joy, praising his swift comprehension. Proceeding upon the great Way, he departed singing.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"Nie Que sleeping"*—his body inclined toward what was said, feigning sleep to avoid seeing or hearing. Having received the Dao so swiftly, Pi Yi rejoiced.
*"Greatly pleased"*—pronounced *yue*.

**[2]**
**[Commentary]** He moves with all transformations.
**[Subcommentary]** His form is like the bones of withered wood; his heart resembles the soil of dead ashes. Devoid of emotion, he directly embodies the true knowing of pure actuality, not relying on past affairs to sustain himself.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Like withered"*—pronounced *kulao*.

**[3]**
**[Commentary]** He is one who transforms alone.
**[Subcommentary]** Vague and dim, he stills illumination and dispels clarity, forgetting both heart and knowing, unfit for plotting. Not one whom the common can recognize—thus, "what manner of man is he!" All from *"form like withered bones"* onward are Pi Yi’s song lyrics.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Vague"*—pronounced *mei* (also *wupeng*); *"dim"*—pronounced *hui*. Li says: *"Vague and dim"* describes the appearance of obscurity.

Shun asked Cheng, "Can the Dao be possessed and held?"
**[1]**
**[Subcommentary]** Cheng was an ancient realized one, Shun’s teacher. The supreme Dao is empty and all-pervading, giving rise to the movement and stillness of all beings. Shun wondered whether this Dao could be found within his own body. Having encountered his master, he thus posed his question.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Cheng"*—pronounced as written. Li says: Shun’s teacher. Another opinion: In ancient times, there were four assistants—front as *yi*, rear as *cheng*, likely official titles.

Cheng replied, "Your body is not your own—how could you possess the Dao?"
**[1]**
**[Commentary]** The body is not something you can possess; it arises spontaneously, a mere clod of earth. If the body is not yours to own, how much less the Dao!
**[Subcommentary]** The Dao transcends the four propositions and eludes the hundred negations. If you cannot even possess your own body, how could you possess the Dao?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Possess the"*—pronounced *fu*; *"clod-like"*—pronounced *kuiran*.

Shun said, "If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?"
**[1]**
**[Subcommentary]** Not yet awakened to the fact that life arises from spontaneity and form from creation, he asked, "If my body is not mine, then whose is it?"

Cheng replied, "It is the form entrusted to you by Heaven and Earth. Life is not yours to possess—it is the harmony entrusted by Heaven and Earth. Nature and destiny are not yours to possess—they are the compliance entrusted by Heaven and Earth. Even your descendants are not yours to possess—they are the shedding entrusted by Heaven and Earth. Thus, in walking, you know not where you go; in dwelling, you know not what sustains you; in eating, you know not the taste. You are but the strong yang qi of Heaven and Earth—how could you possess it?"
**[1]**
**[Commentary]** If the body were yours to possess, then beauty and ugliness, life and death would be for you to control. Yet when qi gathers, you cannot prevent birth; when qi scatters, you cannot halt death. Clearly, it is a spontaneous coalescence—not yours to possess.
**[Subcommentary]** *Commission* means coalescence. Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang coalesce the qi of hardness, softness, harmony, and compliance to form your body, nature, and destiny. Thus, coalescence brings life; dispersion brings death. Since life and death, coalescence and dispersion do not depend on you, how can you claim your body as your own?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Entrusted form"*—Sima says: *Commission* means accumulation. ◎Yu Yue says: Sima’s explanation does not fit the meaning. In the *Strategies of Qi*, "I wish to entrust it to you," Gao’s commentary says: *Entrust* means to consign. In the *Zuo Tradition*, second year of Duke Cheng, "The king sent to entrust to the three officials," Du’s commentary says: *Entrust* means to assign. Thus, "the form entrusted by Heaven and Earth" means the form consigned and assigned by Heaven and Earth. The same applies to the three subsequent instances of *entrust*.

**[2]**
**[Commentary]** Qi coalesces and sheds like a cicada’s molting.
**[Subcommentary]** Yin and yang coalesce, giving rise to descendants, spontaneously transforming like a cicada’s shedding.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Entrusted shedding"*—pronounced *tuowo* (also *yue*, *chaiwai*, *shirui*, *shilie*).

**[3]**
**[Commentary]** All arise spontaneously within you—thus, you know not.
**[Subcommentary]** Walking, dwelling, eating, and tasting all follow spontaneity. Tracing their origins, none knows whence they come. Who walks? Who dwells? Who eats? Who tastes? None knows the source—all arise spontaneously. ◎Jia Shifu says: Daily, one sees walking but never knows the destination; daily, one sees dwelling but never knows what sustains it; daily, one sees eating but never knows the taste. Thus, one’s going is not self-directed; one’s dwelling for decades is not self-sustained; one’s eating and tasting are not self-discerned. The qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang moves and turns it—none can be possessed.

**[4]**
**[Commentary]** *Strong yang* is but movement. This clarifies that the Dao may be used to relinquish the body and forget life.
**[Subcommentary]** *Strong yang* means movement. How could this body, formed by the coalescence of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang’s moving qi, be possessed?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Strong yang qi of Heaven and Earth"*—Guo says: *Strong yang* is but movement. The text states that even Heaven and Earth move—how much less can the life born of qi’s coalescence be grasped and retained!

**[Collation]** (1) The missing or erroneous text cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, where "Sunzi" appears as "descendants."

Confucius asked Lao Dan: “Today, with leisure and ease, I venture to inquire about the supreme Dao.”

**[1]** **[Subcommentary]** *Yan* means "at peace." Confucius studied under Laozi, thus taking advantage of this tranquil, unoccupied moment to inquire about the profound Dao.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Yan"* (晏): Yu Jian’s reading; Xu’s reading: Yu Xian; another reading: Yu Jian. *"Xian"* (闲): pronounced *xian*.

Lao Dan replied: “Purify and fast, dredge your heart, cleanse and refine your spirit, shatter and strike your knowledge! The Dao—how abstruse and difficult to speak of! Let me tell you its broad outlines.”

**[1]** **[Subcommentary]** *Shu* means "to wash away." *Zaoxue* means "pure and bright." *Er* refers to "you." *Pouji* means "to break apart." *Yai* means "division." If you wish to inquire about the Dao, you must first purify your heart’s traces, fast with reverent sincerity, wash and rinse body and mind, clarify and settle the spirit, shatter sagely wisdom, and sweep away all emptiness. Yet the profound Dao is dark and obscure, difficult to articulate—let me present its divisions and speak of it in rough outline.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Zhai jie"* (齊戒): *ce jie* (side-by-side reading). *"Yao"* (窅): *yao*. Some say: "to soak." *"Pou"* (掊): *pu kou*; Xu’s reading: *fang gou*. *"Er zhi"* (而知): pronounced *zhi* (wisdom). *"Yaoran"* (窅然): *wu liao*. *"Jiang wei"* (將為): *yu wei*.
**[Collation]** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *zhai* (斋).

“Brightness arises from obscurity; pattern emerges from formlessness; spirit arises from the Dao; form originates from essence. Yet the myriad things beget one another through form. Thus, those with nine orifices are born from the womb, while those with eight orifices hatch from eggs. Their coming leaves no trace; their going has no boundary. No gate, no chamber—vast and unbounded, they reach in all four directions. Those who attain this are strong in limb, clear in thought, keen of ear and eye. Their minds do not toil; their responses have no fixed form. Heaven cannot but be high; Earth cannot but be vast; sun and moon cannot but move; the myriad things cannot but flourish—such is the Dao!”

**[1]** **[Commentary]** All these illustrate its solitary arising, needing no external aid.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Wu xing"* (無形): refers to the Great Beginning.

**[2]** **[Commentary]** All proceed from essence to the coarse.
**[Subcommentary]** *Lun* means "pattern." Bright and manifest things arise from the abstruse and obscure; human patterns and affairs emerge from formlessness; the heart of spirit and wisdom arises from the profound Dao; the categories of form, substance, and qi take root in the subtle and refined.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Xing ben sheng yu jing"* (形本生於精): refers to the constant Dao.

**[3]** **[Commentary]** Though the myriad things beget one another through form, all is spontaneous. Thus, womb-born and egg-born creatures cannot exchange their kinds—this clarifies that spirit and qi cannot be fabricated.
**[Subcommentary]** The formless Dao gives rise to things with form; things with form, in turn, beget one another through form, substance, and qi. Thus, humans and beasts, with nine orifices, are womb-born, while birds and fish, with eight orifices, hatch from eggs—all received naturally and cannot be interchanged.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Jiu qiao"* (九竅): *ku diao*. *"Luan sheng"* (卵生): *li guan*. *"Yi zhong"* (易種): *zhang yong*.

**[4]** **[Commentary]** Those who follow their natural disposition and wander the path without trace cast their forms amid Heaven and Earth, entrust their spirits beyond the eight directions. Thus, without gate or chamber, they reach boundlessly in all four directions, roaming the six directions in harmony with transformation.
**[Subcommentary]** To take non-arrival as arrival is to arrive without trace; to take non-departure as departure is to depart without boundary. Thus, they enter and exit without doors, come and go without edges, and so can expand to the four directions, pervading all things.
**[5]** **[Commentary]** Those born and encountering this Dao preserve their Heaven-endowed nature and settle their spirit.
**[Subcommentary]** *Yao* means "to encounter." *Xun* means "to penetrate." Those who encounter the Dao and meet the true principle find their bodies at peace, their limbs strong, their thoughts penetrating, their hearing and sight keen. The mind without mind is used without toil; the response without response answers without fixed form.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Yao yu"* (邀於): *gu yao*. ◎ Yu Yue says: The *Shuowen* has no *yao* character. Under the *chi* radical: *jiao* (徼), meaning "to follow." This is today’s *yao* character. It also says: *xun* (循), meaning "to follow in sequence." Thus, *yao* also means "to follow," and *yao yu ci* means "those who follow this." Guo’s commentary, "those born and encountering this Dao," takes *yao* as "to encounter," which is circuitous and lacks ancient authority—likely an error. *"Si lü"* (思慮): *xi si*. *"Xun da"* (恂達): *xun*.

**[6]** **[Commentary]** All these cannot but be so naturally—not that the Dao compels them.
**[Subcommentary]** The Two Modes rely on emptiness to be high and vast; the Three Luminaries depend on the profound Dao to move; the myriad things attain it to flourish—such is the Dao’s efficacy. Thus, the *Laozi* says: "Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes stable; the myriad things attain the One and live." This is the meaning.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Tian bu de bu gao"* (天不得不高): means that without the One Dao, it cannot be high. *"Dao yu"* (道與): *yu*. The same below.

**[Collation]** (1) The *Shide Tang* edition reads *zhi* (枝).

Moreover, extensive study does not necessarily yield true knowledge; eloquent debate does not necessarily bring wisdom—this the sage has decisively settled. (1)

As for that which, when augmented, gains no increase, and when diminished, suffers no loss—this the sage preserves. (2) Abyssal, it resembles the sea; (3) lofty, it cycles from end to beginning, (4) measuring and sustaining the myriad things without exhaustion. (5) Then is the Dao of the noble one external to these? (6) All things turn to it for sustenance yet it is never exhausted—this is its Dao! (7)

**[1]** **[Commentary]** To cast aside knowledge and wisdom and entrust all to spontaneity.

**[Subcommentary]** Vast reading of the classics does not necessarily yield true knowledge; grand eloquence and ornate words do not necessarily bring luminous wisdom. Thus, the *Laozi* says: "The good do not debate; the debaters are not good. The knowing are not learned; the learned do not know." This is what the sage has decisively cast aside.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Bo zhi bu bi zhi"* (博之不必知): to observe variant texts is called "extensive study." *"Yi duan"* (以断): *duan* (端管反). The commentary is the same.

**[2]** **[Commentary]** To let each preserve its proper measure alone, thus rendering knowledge and wisdom unnecessary.

**[Subcommentary]** Extensive knowledge and eloquent wisdom do not enhance clarity; silence and facing the wall do not diminish it. This is what is called "neither increasing nor decreasing, neither harming nor benefiting." The sage’s wondrous embodiment is thus preserved and cherished.

**[3]** **[Commentary]** Its bearing is measureless.

**[Subcommentary]** The Tail Hole drains it yet it is not depleted; the hundred rivers pour into it yet it does not swell. Profound and vast, it serves as a metaphor for the mysterious Dao.

**[4]** **[Commentary]** One who moves with transformation accumulates boundless cycles—this may be called "lofty."

**[Subcommentary]** *Weiwei*: a term denoting great height. The Dao transcends the Great One and surpasses the Two Modes, encompassing the infinite—hence the exclamation of its loftiness. Ending then beginning anew, this clarifies its lack of beginning or end, its ceaseless renewal, its elusive following.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Weiwei"* (魏魏): *yu wei* (鱼威反). *"Ze fu"* (则复): *fu you* (扶又反).

**[5]** **[Commentary]** Employing things without being enslaved by them—thus it is never exhausted.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Yun liang"* (运量): *yin liang* (音亮).
*"Wan wu er bu kui"* (万物而不匮): *qiu wei fan* (求位反).
This means allowing things to move by their own nature, each fulfilling its measure.

**[6]** **[Commentary]** Each draws from itself and is sufficient.
**[Subcommentary]** To bear and sustain the ten thousand things, to contain and nourish all beings—pervading the boundless without exhaustion—this is the Way of the sage and the noble person. This is not distant; it lies near, within the heart. Since it does not rely on external provision, how could it be other than internal?

**[7]** **[Commentary]** Returning to employ the myriad things, thus I am never exhausted. This clarifies that the Dao’s provision for things lies in its non-provision; through non-provision, things attain sufficiency—hence the saying, "This is its Way." It speaks of the supreme Dao’s non-action; only non-action is truly worthy of the name "Dao."
**[Subcommentary]** All that has awareness, all that is without emotion, receives this mysterious Dao. Yet its mysterious power operates in hidden pervasion, never exhausted. Now, Dao and things are neither one nor distinct, yet apart from the Dao there are no things—hence the saying, "This is its Way."
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Zhi shan"* (之赡): *she yan fan* (涉艳反). The same below.

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) *Weiwei* (魏魏) follows the Shide Tang edition; the commentary and phonetic gloss also read *Wei*.
(2) The *Quewu* text cites Liu Deyi’s edition, where all instances of *kui* (匮) appear as *yi* (遗).
(3) The character *wan* (万) is supplied following Liu Wendian’s proposal.

There exists in the Middle Kingdom one who is neither yin nor yang, abiding between Heaven and Earth, simply and only human—who will return to the Origin.

Viewed from its root, life is but a congeries of qi. Though there be long life and early death, how far apart are they? A mere moment’s discourse. How could it suffice to distinguish Yao from Jie?

Fruits and melons have their principles; human relationships, though difficult, are ordered by mutual ranking. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes beyond them without attachment. Harmonizing and responding—this is virtue; coinciding and responding—this is the Dao. Herein lies the rise of emperors and the founding of kings.

**[1] [Commentary]** Without partial designation.
**[2] [Commentary]** Aloof and self-reliant, content with whatever is encountered, utterly devoid of merit or fame.
**[Subcommentary]** The Middle Kingdom refers to the Nine Provinces. The Dao that humans receive is neither yin nor yang, neither soft nor hard, neither short nor long—thus transcending the four propositions and departing from the hundred negations. Abiding between Heaven and Earth, one is simply and only human, without bias. Some texts write *zhi* (值, "encounter") instead of *zhi* (直, "simply"), meaning that within the cosmos, one encounters being human without attachment.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Zhi qie"* (直且): read as written. Formerly *zi yu* (子余) *fan* (反).
**[3] [Commentary]** Not pursuing the branch.
**[Subcommentary]** Without bias, one is simply human—thus able to return to the root and revert to the Origin.
**[4] [Commentary]** Merely an aggregation of qi.
**[Subcommentary]** The root is the Dao. *Yin-yi* (喑醷) denotes the gathering of qi. Observing from the perspective of the Dao, one knows that life is but a thing of aggregated qi—how could it be worth cherishing?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Yin"* (喑): *yin* (音荫); Guo: *an* (音暗); Li: *yin* (音饮); alternate reading: *yu gan* (于感) *fan* (反). *"Yi"* (醷): *yu jie* (于界) *fan* (反); Guo: *yu gan* (于感) *fan* (反); Li: *yi* (音意); alternate reading: *ta gan* (他感) *fan* (反). Li and Guo both state: *an-yi* (暗醷) is the appearance of aggregated qi.
**[5] [Commentary]** Even life and death are not sufficiently distinct—how much less the interval between long life and early death!
**[Subcommentary]** Within a single lifetime, amid a hundred years, even if one lives long or dies young, how great is the difference? A fleeting moment’s discourse—how could it suffice to affirm Yao or negate Jie and make distinctions between them?
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Ji he"* (几何): *ju qi* (居岂) *fan* (反).
**[6] [Commentary]** All things have their principles; one need only follow them.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Guo luo"* (果蓏): Xu: *li guo* (力果) *fan* (反).
**[7] [Commentary]** Human relationships involve the vicissitudes of wisdom—thus they are difficult. Yet their wisdom merely orders them by mutual ranking; one need only follow and accord with them.
**[Subcommentary]** Those on trees are called *guo* (fruits); those on the ground are called *luo* (melons). Peaches, plums, and the like, gourds and calabashes—whether tree-born or vine-born—all have their principles. Human existence in the world is fraught with peril and difficulty, yet nobility and baseness, honor and humility, are mutually ranked. One need only follow them, and they naturally accord with the Dao—just as fruits and melons have their inherent principles.
**[8] [Commentary]** Following whatever is encountered.
**[9] [Commentary]** Rightly passing beyond what should be passed.
**[Subcommentary]** Encountering eminence and rank, one follows without resistance; having passed beyond them, one does not linger.
**[10] [Commentary]** *Tiao* (调) and *ou* (偶) mean harmonizing and coinciding.
**[Subcommentary]** Harmonizing the myriad things and responding accordingly—this is supreme virtue. Coinciding with circumstances and responding to stimuli—this is the sagely Dao.
**[11] [Commentary]** It is thus and no more.
**[Subcommentary]** The rise of emperors and kings, their response to the multitudes—nothing surpasses harmonizing and coinciding with the times, responding to stimuli and engaging with things.

One who lives between Heaven and Earth is like a white colt passing through a gap—suddenly, it is gone. Bursting forth, none fails to emerge; flowing smoothly, none fails to enter. Having transformed and been born, one transforms again and dies. The living things mourn it; humankind grieves for it. Unfastening Heaven’s quiver, casting off Heaven’s [bonds], in a whirl of confusion, the hun and po depart, and the body follows—thus the great return!

The formless takes form; the formed becomes formless. This is what all people know, yet it is not what the perfected strive for. This is what the multitude commonly discuss. Those who have attained do not discuss; those who discuss have not attained. Manifest insight encounters no value; disputation is inferior to silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is inferior to blocking [the ears]. This is called the great attainment.

The *Shiwen* notes: 《勃然》 *boran* (stepped swiftly), 《油然》 *youran* (smoothly flowing), 《漻然》 *liuran* (Lí: *liran*). [3] The commentary states: All are transformations. [4] The commentary states: The dead do not mourn. [5] The commentary states: The dead kind do not grieve. The *Shu* explains: Life and death, coming and going—all are but transformations. Entrusting them to the Creator, why cling to them? Thus, in death, living things and humankind share in the duty of grief, but those not of their kind or life do not grieve or mourn.

◎ Jia Shifu remarks: Living things mourn it, and thus we know mourning—only because they live, yet they do not know that life, too, will ultimately perish. Humankind grieves for it, and thus we know grief—only because humans possess awareness, yet they do not know that human awareness, too, will ultimately perish.

[6] The commentary states: To be uniquely freed. The *Shu* explains: *Tāo* is the quiver’s casing; *shù* is to bind the casing. People cling to right and wrong, delight in life and abhor death, thus binding themselves to life and death. Now, having unified right and wrong and forgotten life and death, they cast off Heaven’s natural quiver. The *Shiwen* notes: 《天弢》 *tiāntāo* (chìdāo), the *Zilin* states: the covering of a bow. 《堕其》 *duòqí* (xǔguī), 《天》 *tiān* (chénbǐ).

[7] The commentary states: Transformations are misty and obscure. The *Shiwen* notes: 《宛乎》 *wǎnhū* (yǔruǎn), 《絪》 *yīn* (yīn), also written as 烟 *yān* (yīn). 《缊》 *yùn* (yúyún), also written as 煴 *yūn* (same sound). ◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The current text reads *yānyūn* (misty and obscure).

[8] The commentary states: Do not apply the mind to their midst. The *Shu* explains: In the tangled, winding dispersal, all things follow their own course. The *hun* and *po* ascend to Heaven, bones and flesh return to earth, spirit and *qi* scatter and drift—freely they go from being to non-being. This is the great return.

[9] The commentary states: The formless takes form; if one forces form upon it, one ruins that form. The *Shu* explains: Before a person is born, they fundamentally lack form; thus, they arise from the formless. When *qi* gathers, form comes to be; when *qi* disperses, it returns to the formless. The *Shiwen* notes: 《则败》 *zébài* (bǔmài).

[10] The commentary states: Though they know this, they cannot allow it to take form naturally but instead impose form upon it, thus often ruining it. [11] The commentary states: Striving prevents attainment. The *Shu* explains: From the formless arising form, from form returning to the formless—this is what all people know. Yet these are but common matters of the world, not the profound concerns of the perfected.

[12] The commentary states: Though they discuss it, they still cannot help but strive, and thus they do not attain. The *Shu* explains: The coming and going of form and substance, of life and death—this is what the multitude commonly discusses. [13] The commentary states: Unawares, one attains. The *Shiwen* notes: 《悗然》 *mǎnrán* (wángběn).

[14] The *Shu* explains: Those sagely persons, having forgotten words and grasped the principle, have nothing to discuss. If they were to discuss it, they would not attain the Dao. [15] The commentary states: Obscurely attaining, one encounters it. The *Shu* explains: *Zhí* means to meet. Only by closing off wisdom and blocking the senses can one obscurely unite with the profound principle. If one relies on clear hearing and seeing, one will not encounter the real.

[16] The commentary states: By silencing and blocking them, one has nothing to pursue, and thus attains greatly. The *Shu* explains: Grand eloquence adorns words, distancing one from the real; forgetting words and abiding in stillness, one draws near to the profound Dao. Thus, the Dao cannot be sought through much hearing; seeking through much hearing is inferior to obscuring and blocking. If one can subtly grasp this meaning, one may be said to have deeply attained the great principle.

◎ Jia Shifu remarks: The Dao is formless. To see it and take it as the Dao is as if one had skillfully encountered it, yet fundamentally, there is no encounter. The *Shuowen* states: *Zhí* means to place. If one cannot lift and place it, then what one sees as the Dao here, another sees as a different Dao there, and there will be no end to disputation. Thus, disputation is inferior to silence.

Dongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: “Where does the so-called Dao reside?” [1] The *Shu* explains: Dwelling in Dongguo, he was called Dongguo Zi—Master Dongguo, the teacher of Wuze. He asked Zhuangzi: “This so-called empty, penetrating Dao—where does it reside?” The *Shiwen* notes: 《东郭子》 *Dōngguō Zǐ* (Lǐ: He dwelled in Dongguo).

Zhuangzi said: “It resides nowhere and yet everywhere.” [1]
[1] *Subcommentary*: The Dao is all-pervading; it is present in every place.

Dongguo Zi said: “Name a place, then I will accept it.”
[1] *Commentary*: He wished Zhuangzi to specify where it resides.
*Subcommentary*: As Guo’s commentary states: He wished Zhuangzi to specify where it resides.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Desire to make* (欲令): pronounced *lì*.

Zhuangzi said: “It is in the ants.”
Dongguo Zi asked: “Why so lowly?”
Zhuangzi said: “It is in the weeds and millet.”
Dongguo Zi asked: “Why even lower?”
Zhuangzi said: “It is in the tiles and bricks.”
Dongguo Zi asked: “Why still lower?”
Zhuangzi said: “It is in excrement and urine.”
Dongguo Zi did not respond.

[1] Zhuangzi said: “Your question, Master, fundamentally misses the essence. [2] When the inspector of the market’s swine-treader was asked about judging a pig’s fatness, the more he probed the lower parts, the clearer the condition became. [3] You must not insist on a single place, for nothing escapes the Dao. [4] The supreme Dao is like this, and so too are grand words. [5] The three—pervasiveness, universality, and completeness—are different names for the same reality; their meaning is one. [6]
[1] *Subcommentary*: The great Dao is nowhere absent, yet wherever it is, it is not confined. Thus, it is present everywhere, without rejecting the foul or base. Dongguo Zi failed to grasp this truth and believed the Dao to be lofty and pure. When told it was in tiles and bricks, he already found it too lowly; upon hearing of excrement and urine, he grew indignant and did not respond.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Ants* (蝼蚁): *lóu*, *yǐ*. *In* (在): *dài*. *Weeds* (稊): also written 稊. *Millet* (稗): *bài*; Li explains: *tí* and *bài* are two types of grass. ◎Lu Wenzhao notes: The current text reads *tí-bài*. *Tiles and bricks* (瓦甓): also written 甓, *bì*. *Excrement* (屎): *shǐ*; in older texts, *shī*. Sometimes written 矢. *Urine* (溺): *niào*.

[2] *Commentary*: To point to its manifestations and say it is nowhere absent, yet then to find fault with this, is to miss the essence.
*Subcommentary*: The Dao is nowhere absent—how could it be only in weeds and millet? Your question, Master, still falls short of the truth.

[3] *Commentary*: *Shǐ* means a large pig. When the market inspector treads on a pig to judge its fatness, the more he presses the harder-to-fatten parts, the better he understands the pig’s true condition. Now, when asked where the Dao resides, and one illustrates it by descending to ever baser things, it becomes certain that the Dao does not escape anything.
*Subcommentary*: *Zheng* is an official title, equivalent to today’s market magistrate. *Huo* is a personal name. *Jian* refers to the market overseer, equivalent to today’s butcher. *Shǐ* means pig. The method of judging a pig’s fatness, as asked of the butcher, is this: tread on the pig’s legs and haunches—the harder-to-fatten parts—to gauge its condition. Why? If even the lower, harder-to-fatten parts have flesh, then the easier-to-fatten parts must be rich with fat. Likewise, if the Dao is present in excrement and urine, the lowliest places, then it must pervade even the purest and most refined.
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Zheng Huo’s question to the market overseer* (正获之问于监): *gǔ*. *Treading on the pig* (市履狶): *xī*.

The *Every Descent Further Clarifies* (《每下愈况》), Li [Yun] says: *Zheng* is a pavilion guard; *Huo* is his name. *Jian-shi* (market overseer) is the chief of the market. *Xi* is a large pig. *Lü* means to tread. The market chief treads on the pig, pressing its thighs and legs—the parts where the pig is hardest to fatten—thus knowing whether the pig is fat. Inquiring into the Dao is likewise: by examining the lowly and base, one comes to know the Dao.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Shòu* (瘦): *sè* (色救反). *Zhī chù* (之处): *chāng lǜ* (昌虑反).

**[4]**
*Commentary*: If one must insist that there is something from which the Dao escapes, then the Dao is not all-encompassing. A Dao that is not all-encompassing is insufficient to be called the Dao.
*Subcommentary*: *Wu* (无) refers to the Dao of non-action. The great Dao is vast and boundless, governing all without exception. You must not say that the supreme Dao escapes or abandons things. If it truly escaped things, how could it be all-pervading?

**[5]**
*Commentary*: This clarifies that the Dao does not escape things.
*Subcommentary*: The supreme Dao is principle; the great teaching is instruction. Since principle does not escape things, the teaching likewise pervades all without bias.

**[6]**
*Subcommentary*: All-encompassing and universally pervasive, the Dao is present in all things. This further clarifies that the supreme Dao does not escape things. Though it may have three different names, in essence, its principle and purport converge as one.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Zhōu biàn* (周遍): *biàn* (音遍).
*Collation*: (1) The *Quewu* edition, citing Zhang Junfang and Cheng Xuanying, includes *wei* (谓) after *bi* (必).

We have wandered together in the Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever, merging in discussion without end or limit! We have dwelled together in non-action—serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease! My aspiration is emptied; I go forth yet do not know where I arrive. I depart and return yet do not know where I rest. I have come and gone yet do not know where it ends. I wander in boundless expanse, where great wisdom enters yet does not know its limit.

The one who gives things their thingness is without boundary with things, yet things have boundaries—what is called the boundary of things. The boundary of the boundless is the boundary that is not a boundary. It is said: fullness and emptiness, decline and decay—what is full and empty is not full and empty; what declines and decays is not decline and decay. What is root and branch is not root and branch; what accumulates and disperses is not accumulation and dispersal.

**[1]**
*Commentary*: If one wanders in what *is*, one cannot be universally all-encompassing. Only by merging in discussion does one realize the Dao is present in all things. Once one knows the Dao is present in all things, one can then be unbounded and without attachment, wandering in the infinite.
*Subcommentary*: The Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever refers to the abode of the mysterious Dao—where not a single thing exists, hence "nothing-whatsoever." The three terms—all-encompassing, universally pervasive, and present in all—describe wandering together in the realm of the supreme Dao. Since their essential purport is one, they merge in discussion, darkly aligning with the mysterious principle, thus without beginning, end, or limit.

**[2]**
*Commentary*: All this arises from non-action.
*Subcommentary*: This collectively extols the abundant power and virtue of the three—all-encompassing, universally pervasive, and present in all. Having wandered in the realm of the supreme Dao and dwelled in the domain of non-action, one can thus be tranquil and still, silent and clear, yielding and harmonious, at ease and unhurried.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Dàn ér* (澹而): *tú zhàn* (徒暂反).
◎ Qingfan’s note: *Mò ér qīng* (漠而清): *mò* also means clear; ancient texts often use such reduplicative expressions. The *Erya* states: *mò* (漠) means to examine, to be clear. Fan’s commentary: *mòrán* (漠然) is the appearance of clarity. *Mò* can also be written as *mò* (莫). In the *Zuozhuan*, twenty-eighth year, De Zheng responds in harmony, saying *mò* (莫); Du’s commentary: *mòrán* (莫然) means clear and still.
*Ér xián* (而闲): *xián* (音闲).

**[3]**
*Commentary*: Empty and vast.
*Subcommentary*: The sage who attains the Dao aligns with principle and the mysterious truth; their nature and aspiration are empty and open, silent and vast.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Liáo* (寥): *liáo* (音辽).

**[4]**
*Commentary*: If the aspiration is empty and vast, then there is nowhere to go; having nowhere to go, one goes yet does not know where one arrives. If there *were* somewhere to go, principle would not yet stir, yet the aspiration would already be *wù* (骛).
*Phonetic Gloss*: *Yǐ jīng* (已惊): as written. Also written as *wù* (骛), *wù* (音务).
◎ Qingfan’s note: Guo’s commentary—"if there were somewhere to go, principle would not yet stir, yet the aspiration would already be *jīng* (惊)"—*jīng* is difficult to understand; the meaning should follow the *Shiwen*’s *wù* (骛), which is correct. *Wù* and *chí* (驰) share the same meaning; the commentary means "not yet stirred, yet the aspiration has already raced ahead." Aspiration cannot be said to be *jīng* (惊). *Jīng* and *wù* are similar in form, hence the error. (In the *Huainanzi*, *chí* (驰) is written as *chěng* (聘), and *jīng* is further corrupted to *wù*.)

**[5]**
*Commentary*: This is following the natural course.

**[Subcommentary]**
The aspiration, being already still and silent, thus accords with the absence of going and returning. Even if one were to "go without going" or "come without coming," there would ultimately be no place of arrival, nor any abiding.

**[6]**
*Commentary*: It is merely that going and coming do not proceed from knowledge; they are not the absence of going and coming. Going and coming are the constant principle of the natural course—can they ever reach an end?

**[Subcommentary]**
Even if one were to go and return in accordance with the Creator, or follow the transformations of life and death, drifting with change and yielding to transformation, one would still not know beginning or end.

**[7]**
*Commentary*: *Fenghong* refers to the vast and empty. The person of great wisdom roams in the boundless expanse, freely following the course of transformations—hence, they do not know.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Panghuang* is the name for unrestrained wandering; *fenghong* describes the appearance of emptiness and vastness, referring to the state of attunement. It speaks of the person of great sagely wisdom who can accord with the principle of stillness, silence, emptiness, and vastness—thus, they wander freely and at ease, unrestrained and without limit.

*Phonetic Gloss*: *Pang* (彷): pronounced *páng*. Also written as *páng* (彷).

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*Huang* (徨): pronounced *huáng*.
*Feng* (冯): *pí bīng* (皮冰) *fǎn*, also *pǔ gēng* (普耕) *fǎn*, or *bù gēng* (步耕) *fǎn*.
*Hong* (闳): pronounced *hóng*.
Li [Yun] says: *Fenghong* (冯闳) both mean "great."
Guo [Xiang] says: It refers to emptiness and vastness.

**[8]**
*Commentary*: To "thing" things means there are no things, yet things spontaneously become things. Since things spontaneously become things, they are thus obscure.

*Subcommentary*: *Ji* (际) means edge or boundary. The one who can "thing" things is the sage. The sage is obscurely one with the myriad conditions, thus sharing no boundary of self and other with things.

**[9]**
*Commentary*: Things have boundaries, so they constantly interact yet cannot be obscurely one—this is what is truly called a boundary.

*Subcommentary*: The emotions of things discriminate, accepting and rejecting in endless ways, hence there are boundaries of interaction between self and other.

**[10]**
*Commentary*: The one without boundaries, though bearing the name of "thinging" things, simply clarifies that things spontaneously become things. The one who "things" things ultimately has no thing—where then is the boundary?

*Subcommentary*: The boundary that is no-boundary is the sage’s penetrating insight; the no-boundary that is a boundary is the deluded attachment of the vulgar.

**[11]**
*Commentary*: Having clarified that the one who "things" things has no thing, and that things cannot spontaneously become things, then who is the maker? All is suddenly and spontaneously so.

*Subcommentary*: Wealth and honor are fullness; poverty and lowliness are emptiness. Aging and illness are decline and decay; beginning and end are root and branch. Birth is accumulation; death is dispersal. The one who "things" things is not a thing—then who gives life to things? This clarifies that what can "thing" and what is "thinged" are both not things. Since things are not things, how can one speak of fullness and emptiness, decline and decay? Thus, what is called fullness and emptiness is truly not fullness and emptiness. As the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "If you can illuminate this, what is taken as right is actually wrong."

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*Shuaisha* (衰杀): *sè jiè* (色界) *fǎn*, Xu [Shen] reads *suǒ lì* (所例) *fǎn*. The same below.

The character *jīng* (惊) follows the *Phonetic Gloss*, the *Shide Tang* edition, and Guo Qingfan’s annotation; only the *Fusong* edition has *zhì* (至).

He Gandan and Shennong studied together under Lao Longji. One day, Shennong leaned on his armrest with the door closed, dozing at midday. At noon, He Gandan flung open the door and entered, saying: "Old Long is dead!" Shennong, still leaning on his armrest, rose with his staff, then suddenly cast it aside and laughed, saying: "Heaven knew my stubbornness, rudeness, and arrogance, so it abandoned me and let him die. Alas, Master! He died without having unleashed my wild words!"

**[Annotation 1]**
[Commentary] His surname was He, his courtesy name Gandan. This Shennong was not the Shennong of the Three Sovereigns but a later figure. The two studied together under Lao Longji, which was also a sobriquet.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Yú Hé* (于河): pronounced *yú hé*. *Hé Gān* (荷甘): pronounced *hé gān*. Some versions write it as *Kē* (苛). *Lǎo Lóngjí* (老龙吉): Li [Yi] says: "A man who embodied the Dao."

**[Annotation 2]**
[Commentary] *Yǐn* (隐) means "to lean." *Hé* (阖) means "to close." *Zhā* (奓) means "to open" or "to push aside." Those who study the Dao concentrate their spirit and settle their minds, closing their doors to lean on their armrests, preserving silence in meditation. When He Gandan heard of his teacher’s death, he pushed open the door to announce it.
[Phonetic Gloss] *Yǐn jī* (隐机): pronounced *yú jìn*. The same below.

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The present text reads *jī* (几, "armrest"). *Hé hù* (阖户): pronounced *hù là*. *Zhòu míng* (昼瞑): pronounced *mián*. *Zhā* (奓): Guo reads *chǔ yě*, also *shē*; Xu reads *dū jià*, also *chǔ yè*. Sima says: "to open."

**[Annotation 3]**
**[Commentary]** He rose, awakening to the fact that death is not worth alarm, and so returned to lay down his staff and laugh.
**[Exegesis]** *Bō rán* (嚗然) is the sound of setting down the staff. When Shennong heard of Ji’s death, he clutched his staff in shock; reflecting again that death is not worth mourning, he then laid it down and laughed.
◎ Yu Yue says: Having already said he "clutched his staff and rose," it is inconsistent to say he "leaned on the armrest." The phrase *yǐn jī* (隐几) may be a scribal interpolation from the earlier passage about Shennong leaning on the armrest, closing the door, and meditating by day.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Bō rán* (嚗然): pronounced *bō*, also *fú miǎo*, also *fú mào*. Li says: "the sound of setting down the staff." *Tóu zhàng* (投杖): some versions read *fàng zhàng* (放杖, "lay down the staff").
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: The present text reads *fàng zhàng* (放杖).

**[Annotation 4]**
**[Commentary]** From Jianwu downward, all took the ultimate words as madness and did not believe them. Thus, apart from Lao Long, Lian Shu, and their like, none were fit to speak with.
**[Exegesis]** *Fūzǐ* (夫子, "Master") refers to Lao Longji. His virtue was natural, so he was called *tiān* (天, "Heaven"). *Kuáng yán* (狂言, "mad words") are the ultimate words, which the world cannot comprehend, hence the ultimate words are called "mad." The Master knew I was eccentric and coarse, negligent and inattentive, so he abandoned our company, ceased, and died. With the wise man gone, the ultimate words are cut off; no one remains to discourse on the profound or instruct, to open and enlighten my heart.
**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Pì lòu* (僻陋): pronounced *pǐ yì*. *Màn* (慢): Wu reads *wǔ bàn*, Xu reads *wú jiàn*, Guo reads as written. *Dà* (訑): Tu reads *tú dàn*, Xu reads *tú jiàn*, Guo reads *dàn*. *Yǐ yǐ fū* (已矣夫): pronounced *yǐ fú*.

Yan Gangdiao, upon hearing this, said: "Those who embody the Dao are the ones to whom the noble persons of the world turn. Now, in Lao Long’s relation to the Dao, he had not attained even one ten-thousandth of the tip of an autumn hair, yet he still knew to conceal his mad words and die—how much more so for those who embody the Dao! Seen, it has no form; heard, it has no sound. In the discourse of men, it is called *míng míng* (冥冥, "obscure"), yet this is but a discourse on the Dao, not the Dao itself."

**[Annotation 1]**
**[Commentary]** Those who embody the Dao are the lords and masters of men.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yǎn* (弇): pronounced *yǎn*. *Gāng* (缸): pronounced *gāng*. *Diào* (吊): Li says: "Yan Gang was a man who embodied the Dao; *Diao* was his given name." *Xì yān* (系焉): means "to be the refuge of all things."

**[Annotation 2]**
**[Commentary]** The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet he had not attained even one ten-thousandth of it.

**[Annotation 3]**
**[Commentary]** This makes clear that the ultimate Dao cannot be attained by words but only by personal realization.

**[Exegesis]** His surname was Yan, his given name Gang, a recluse. *Xì* (系) means "to attach" or "to belong." Hearing of Longji’s death, he offered this discourse: "Those who embody the Dao are revered by the world; the worthy and the noble turn to them in devotion. Now, Lao Long’s relation to the profound Dao was not even one ten-thousandth of the tip of a hair, yet he still knew to conceal his unbridled words and die in accord with the Way—how much more so for those who have awakened to the mystery! Thus, those who deeply embody the Dao and forget words to grasp the principle are exceedingly rare."

**[Annotation 4]**
**[Commentary]** Though called *míng míng* ("obscure"), it is still not the Dao, which shows that the Dao is nameless.

**[Exegesis]** The profound Dao is empty and vast, its wondrous essence beyond form and sound, neither visible nor audible. Thus, when scholars discuss it, they call it *míng míng* ("obscure"), yet this is still not the true Dao.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yóu fù* (犹复): pronounced *fú yòu*.

Thereupon Tai Qing asked Wu Qiong: "Do you know the Dao?"
Wu Qiong said: "I do not know."

**[Annotation 1]**
**[Exegesis]** *Tài* (泰) means "great." The ultimate Dao is vast and boundless, tranquil and empty, embracing the infinite, hence the names Tai Qing ("Great Clarity") and Wu Qiong ("Without Limit"). Tai Qing asked about knowing the Dao, and Wu Qiong answered that he did not know, intending to show that the Dao transcends form and sound and cannot be sought through verbal knowledge.

He then asked Wu Wei.
Wu Wei said: "I know the Dao."
Tai Qing said: "In your knowing the Dao, are there also numerical principles?"
Wu Wei said: "There are."

Tai Qing said: "What are its numerical principles?"
**[Annotation 1]**
**[Exegesis]** Since you claim to know the Dao, do you have names and numbers for it? What are these numerical principles? Please give a brief account.

Wu Wei said: "I know that the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be gathered, can be dispersed—these are the numerical principles by which I know the Dao."
**[Annotation 1]**
**[Exegesis]** Noble as an emperor, base as a servant; gathered as life, dispersed as death—its numbers are boundless. This is but a rough sketch, meant to show that it is not a name yet has names, not a number yet has numbers.

Thereupon Tai Qing, having heard these words, asked Wu Shi: "If this is so, then between Wu Qiong’s not-knowing and Wu Wei’s knowing, which is right and which is wrong?"
**[Annotation 1]**
**[Exegesis]** The ultimate Dao is mysterious and all-pervading, tranquil and without action, unfathomable in its response, without end or beginning—hence the names Wu Qiong ("Without Limit") and Wu Shi ("Without Beginning"). Between Wu Qiong’s not-knowing and Wu Wei’s knowing, who is right and who is wrong? Please determine which is correct.

Wu Shi said: "Not-knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external."
**[Annotation 1]**
**[Exegesis]** Not-knowing accords with principle, hence it is profound and abides within. Knowing deviates from the Dao, hence it is coarse and external.

Thereupon Tai Qing, struck to the center, sighed and said: "Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?"
**[Annotation 1]**
**[Commentary]** That which is attained not through knowing is called *ming* (dark enlightenment).
**[Exegesis]** Tai Qing, having grasped the central Way, sighed in realization that not-knowing is true knowing. Who knows the knowing of not-knowing? This shows how rare true knowing is.

Wu Shi said: "The Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is not it. The Dao cannot be seen; to see it is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken; to speak it is not it. Do you know that which gives form to forms yet itself is formless? The Dao should not be named."
**[Annotation 1]**
**[Commentary]** Thus, it is perfected in the realm of not-hearing and not-seeing, and only then is it attained.
**[Exegesis]** The Dao has no sound, so it cannot be heard with the ears—what is heard is not the Dao. The Dao has no color, so it cannot be seen with the eyes—what is seen is not the Dao. The Dao has no name, so it cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not the Dao.
**[Annotation 2]**
**[Commentary]** Forms form themselves; that which forms forms is ultimately no-thing.
**[Exegesis]** That which gives form and color to the myriad things is itself not form or color—hence it is said to give form to forms yet itself is formless.
**[Annotation 3]**
**[Commentary]** There is the name "Dao," yet ultimately no-thing—thus, the name does not fit.
**[Exegesis]** Names have no power to attain the Dao; the Dao has no reality that corresponds to names—hence, to name the Dao is inappropriate.

Wu Shi said: "One who answers when asked about the Dao does not know the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao admits no questions; questions admit no answers. To question what admits no questions is to question emptiness. To answer what admits no answers is to lack inwardness. Responding to the emptiness of questions with what lacks inwardness—such a one outwardly does not observe the cosmos, inwardly does not know the Great Beginning. Thus, they do not pass beyond Kunlun, nor do they wander in the Great Void."
**[Annotation 1]**
**[Commentary]** To ask out of not-knowing, and to answer such a question, is not the Dao. Not to answer is not what the questioner can attain—thus, though they ask, they ultimately do not hear.
**[Exegesis]** The Dao transcends names and words, so it cannot be questioned or answered. Thus, both asking and answering about the Dao show ignorance.
**[Annotation 2]**
**[Commentary]** This is the meaning of abandoning learning and teaching to return to naturalness.
**[Exegesis]** To embody the Dao is to leave words behind—what questions or answers could there be? These words reiterate the preceding text.
**[Annotation 3]**
**[Commentary]** This is called demanding emptiness.
**[Exegesis]** *Qiong* means "emptiness." To insist on questioning what admits no questions is to demand emptiness.
**[Annotation 4]**
**[Commentary]** To feign existence where there is none is to be external.
**[Exegesis]** To insist on answering what admits no answers is to become externally divided.
**[Note]** Jia Shifu said: The Dao admits no questions—if one conjectures about the Dao and questions it, one first impoverishes oneself, hence "questioning emptiness." The Dao admits no answers—if one conjectures about the Dao and answers it, one follows externals, hence "lacking inwardness."
**[Annotation 5]**
**[Exegesis]** *Yu* refers to the four directions and heaven and earth; *zhou* refers to past and present. The Great Beginning is the root of the Dao. One who meets the emptiness of inner wisdom with a mind external to principle may be said to outwardly not recognize the cosmos of the six directions, and inwardly not know the wondrous root of their own body.
**[Annotation 6]**
**[Commentary]** As for those who ramble through heaven and earth, wander afar, and enter into darkness—this is simply not answering.
**[Exegesis]** Kunlun is a lofty and distant mountain; the Great Void is a profound and mysterious principle. If one remains attached to names and words, still clinging to questions and answers, one has not yet traversed the distant or wandered the profound.

Guang Yao asked Wu You: "Do you, Master, exist? Or do you not exist?"

**[1]**
**[Exegesis]** *Guang Yao* ("Radiance") denotes the faculty of vision—wisdom itself. *Wu You* ("Nonbeing") is the realm it observes. Wisdom possesses the power of illumination, hence the provisional name *Guang Yao*; the realm is empty and quiescent, hence the provisional name *Wu You*. Yet wisdom may be bright or dim, while the realm has no depth or shallowness. Thus, when wisdom questions the realm—does it exist or not?—*Guang Yao* finds no ground for inquiry. Who could discern its form? It is profound and void, seen all day yet unseen, heard yet unheard, grasped yet unattainable.

**[Exegesis]** The wondrous realm is beyond sound and form, where seeing and hearing cease. Thus, when examining its appearance, one finds only stillness and emptiness.
◎ Yu Yue notes: The *Huainanzi*’s "Dao and Its Applications" chapter includes the phrase *"Wu You did not respond"* above *"Guang Yao could not question it."* These five characters should be restored here, for only with *Wu You*’s silence does *Guang Yao*’s inability to question arise. Without them, the meaning is incomplete.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*Yaoran* (窅然): read *wū liǎo*.
*Bozhi* (搏之): read *bó*.

*Guang Yao* said: "Perfect! Who could attain this!"

"Now I can possess nothingness, yet I cannot attain non-nothingness; when one reaches the state of non-existence, how could one arrive at this!"

**[Annotation]** This expresses the meaning of cutting off learning. When one severs it from the Dao, then the learner returns to the root. Thus, the excellence of learning lies precisely in non-learning!

**[Exegesis]** Guang Yao’s luminous wisdom is still shallow—he can only grasp nothingness and lose being, yet cannot transcend both being and non-being. Thus, he sighs that non-existence is profoundly deep; who could attain such mystery! Yet this "non-existence" does not merely mean the absence of being, but also the absence of absence itself—all four propositions and a hundred negations are entirely void. The word "non-" in "non-existence" negates all things without exception; its expression is concise, yet its principle vast—hence it is called "non-existence." As for "how could one arrive at this," the realm of non-existence exhausts principle and fulfills nature, and unless one is a sage of profound virtue, who could embody it? Thus, those of shallow learning and petty wisdom have no way to reach it.

A smith under Da Ma, who forged hooks, was eighty years old yet never missed a hair’s breadth.

Da Ma said: "Is it skill? Or is there a Dao?"

**Annotations and Text:**

① **Annotation:** (Weighing) the lightness or heaviness of the forged hooks without the slightest deviation in hair’s breadth.
**Commentary:** "Da Ma" is an official title, the Grand Marshal of Chu. *Chui* (捶) means "to forge by hammering." *Gou* (钩) refers to a belt hook. The Grand Marshal had a craftsman who, from a young age, excelled at forging hooks. Though he had reached eighty years of age, his skill in forging hooks grew ever more refined. With concentrated mind and focused attention, he made no error even as fine as a hair’s breadth. The hook here refers to a steelyard hook, meaning he could precisely gauge the weight of the hook, knowing its exact heft without the slightest deviation.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*"Da Ma’s forger of hooks was eighty years old yet never missed a hair’s breadth."*
*Chui* (捶): Guo reads as *ding guo* (丁果), Xu as *zhi lei* (之累), Li as *zhi shui* (之睡).
*Da Ma*: The Grand Marshal.
*(Weighing)*: Guo says, "Weighing the lightness or heaviness of the forged hooks without missing a hair’s breadth." An alternate explanation holds that in the region between the three Wei rivers of Jiangdong, people commonly called forging *chui* (捶), with the same pronunciation and character. Guo’s interpretation is incorrect, and this explanation is not followed here.
◎ Lu Wenchong notes: "Forging hooks" was originally written as "forging iron" in older editions; corrected here according to the Song edition. Other editions concur.
*Dian* (玷): Read as *ding tian* (丁恬).
*Chui* (捶): Read as *ding guo* (丁果).

② **Commentary:** The Grand Marshal marveled that, though the craftsman was advanced in years, his forging grew ever more precise. He suspected the craftsman’s skill arose from some special Daoist technique.
**Phonetic Gloss:**
*"Skill?"* Read as *yu* (余). The same below.

① **Collation Notes:**
(1) The Tang manuscript writes *hao* (豪) as *gou* (钩).
(2) The character *dian* (玷) is amended here following the *Shiwen* and the Shide Hall edition.
(3) The Shide Hall edition writes *gou* (钩).

The craftsman said: "Your servant has his *shou*. From the age of twenty, I have delighted in forging hooks. To other things, I pay no heed; apart from hooks, I observe nothing. This is how the user relies on the non-user to prolong its use—how much more so for one who employs nothing yet lacks nothing! What thing does not draw sustenance from this?"

① **Commentary:** He possessed no other technique but held fast to his *shou*. From youth, he had devoted himself single-mindedly to this craft. Beyond forging hooks, he observed nothing, and through long practice, it became his nature, thus attaining such mastery.

◎ Wang Niansun notes: *Shou* (守) is the character *Dao* (道). In the *Da Sheng* chapter, Confucius asks: "Is your skill the result of the Dao?" The craftsman replies: "I have the Dao." This is evidence. The character *Dao* was anciently pronounced like *shou*, hence the interchange. (In the rhymed passages of the Nine Classics, *Dao* is always read as *shou*; the *Chu Ci* and the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi follow this pattern. In the Qin Stele Inscription of Kuaiji, "pursuing the lofty and bright" is written with *Dao* in the *Records of the Grand Historian*'s "Annals of Qin Shi Huang," where *Dao* is replaced by *shou*, sharing the same pronunciation. The *Shuowen* states: *Dao* is written with *chu* (辶) and *shou* (首) as phonetic. The modern edition omits the phonetic component because the two Xu brothers did not understand the ancient pronunciation and excised it.)

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*"Delighted in"* Read as *hu bao* (呼報反).

② **Commentary:** Utterly without distraction, all things respond to his call.

**Exegesis:** That he maintained his skill in forging hooks into old age was due to his reliance on not directing his mind to observe other things. If even borrowing non-use as use allows one to sustain it for a lifetime, how much more so for the sage who embodies the Dao—neither using nor not-using, yet capable of great use! Is it not fitting that all things draw sustenance from him?

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*"To prolong"* Read as *ding zhang* (丁丈反).

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The character *zhi* (之) is supplied here following *Dushu Zazhi*.

Ran Qiu asked Confucius, “Could one know what existed before Heaven and Earth?”

Confucius replied, “Yes. The past is like the present.”¹

¹ **Commentary:** Heaven and Earth endure eternally; there was never a time when they did not exist.

**Exegesis:** Ran, surname Ran, personal name Qiu, was a disciple of Confucius. Here, master and disciple engage in dialogue, inquiring whether the state before the existence of the Two Modes could be known. Since transformation renews itself daily, there is no present and no past—the past is like the present. Thus, Confucius answered that it could be known.

Ran Qiu, having posed his question poorly, withdrew. The next day, he returned and said, “Yesterday, I asked, ‘Could one know what existed before Heaven and Earth?’ You replied, ‘Yes. The past is like the present.’² At the time, I understood clearly, but today I am confused. May I ask what this means?”

² **Exegesis:** He failed to grasp the intent of his own question and thus withdrew. Yet upon reflection, he returned to seek clarification.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*"The next day"* Read as *fu you* (扶又反).
*"Returned"* Read as *xian* (贤遍反).

**Exegesis:** When he first posed the question, his mind was bright and clear. Later, in quiet reflection, his thoughts grew dim and obscure. He dares to ask: why was he once enlightened and now benighted?

Confucius said, “Your former clarity came because the spirit first received it.³ Your present confusion arises because you now seek it with what is not spirit.⁴ There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end.⁵ Could there be descendants before there were descendants? Is this possible?”⁶

³ **Commentary:** To empty the mind and await its mandate is to receive it with the spirit.

⁴ **Commentary:** To think and seek further only leads to greater confusion.

**Exegesis:** Initially, he had not yet awakened; he sharpened his spirit and applied his mind to seek understanding, so he was bright and clear. Later, having grasped the meaning, he no longer exerted his spirit but simply let things be as they are, making no further inquiries—thus, he became dim and obstructed. “Seeking” here means not seeking.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*"Now seek"* Read as *you wei* (于伪反).

⁵ **Commentary:** Not only can the nonexistent not transform into existence, but the existent also cannot transform into nonexistence. Thus, that which exists as a thing, though it undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, cannot become nothing even once. Since it cannot become nothing even once, there has never been a time when Heaven and Earth did not exist.

**Exegesis:** Since things renew themselves daily through transformation, there is no beginning and no end, no past and no present. Thus, we know there was never a time before Heaven and Earth.

⁶ **Commentary:** This speaks of the endless succession of generations.

**Exegesis:** Descendants beget descendants in an unbroken line, generation after generation without end. Heaven and Earth, and all things within them, have no origin, no time when they did not exist. “Is this possible?” means it is not possible.

**Phonetic Gloss:**
*"Descendants before there were descendants"* This refers to the necessity of cause; things cannot arise without reason. Generations succeed one another, so there cannot be descendants without ancestors. Likewise, Heaven and Earth cannot have come into existence after having once been nonexistent.

◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern editions read “descendants” as “descendants and ancestors.”
◎ Jia Shifu comments: Heaven and Earth revolve without ceasing; descendants succeed one another without end. If one supposes there were descendants, then to seek what came before descendants is to confuse oneself from the outset. The revolutions of the great transformations of Heaven and Earth have no beginning and no end. How could one seek what came before Heaven and Earth? Thus, it is said, “The past is like the present”—together, they form an expression of boundless continuity.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The character *fu* (夫) is amended following the *Shide Tang* edition.

Ran Qiu did not respond.

Confucius said, “Enough! No answer is needed. Do not use life to give rise to death,⁷ nor use death to give rise to life.⁸ Do life and death depend on one another?⁹ Each has its own integral form.¹⁰ Was there something that existed before Heaven and Earth?¹¹ That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. A thing cannot emerge before that which gives rise to it, just as there are things. Just as there are things,¹² there is no end.¹³ The sage’s love for others never ends, for he takes this as his model.”¹⁴

⁷ **Commentary:** Death is simply the solitary transformation of the dead; it is not that life gives rise to this death.

⁸ **Commentary:** Life, too, is simply the solitary transformation of the living.

**Exegesis:** “Enough” means to stop; “no answer” means there is none. Gathering and scattering, death and life—all are solitary transformations, renewed daily, never relying on anything else. How could they depend on one another? Thus, one does not use life to give rise to death, nor death to give rise to life. Since Ran Qiu had no response, Confucius stopped him from answering further, for the principle was exhausted here—what more was there to say?

⁹ **Commentary:** It is self-sufficient in its solitary transformation.

¹⁰ **Commentary:** Death and life each form their own integral whole.

**Exegesis:** Death is a solitary transformation—how could it become something else? Since death does not depend on life, we know that life does not depend on death. Death and life, gathering and scattering—each forms its own integral whole, so there is no mutual dependence.

¹¹ **Commentary:** Who could exist before things? If I take yin and yang as prior to things, yin and yang are themselves things. Who, then, existed before yin and yang? If I take spontaneity as prior, spontaneity is simply the self-so of things. If I take the supreme Dao as prior, the supreme Dao is ultimately nothingness. Since it is nothingness, what could precede it? Then who existed before things? Yet there are things, and there is no end—this makes clear that the spontaneity of things is not caused by anything else.

**Exegesis:** That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing.

Thus, that which is not a thing has no before or after. When a thing emerges, it is a thing, and there can be nothing prior to this thing. How do we know this is so? Because it remains a thing. Extending this reasoning, there is ultimately nothing prior to things. Then who existed before things? It is clear that things arise spontaneously, and spontaneity has no end. Thus we know that heaven, earth, and the myriad things have always existed since antiquity, with no time before their existence.

**Exegesis by Shi Shifu:** That which precedes heaven and earth is the Dao. Yet if we call it "generative," then the Dao is also a thing. If we call it a thing, then what gave rise to that which precedes things? Things succeed one another endlessly, and if we trace the origin of things to find what preceded and gave rise to them, how could things ever cease? If they ceased, something would have initiated them; if they do not cease, what could initiate them? Therefore, when a thing emerges, it cannot precede other things.

**Commentary:** Taking spontaneity as the source, its grace flows through a hundred generations without end.

**Exegesis:** The sage who attains the Dao, with compassionate love and nurturing care, extends grace through a hundred generations without limit. This is because their virtue harmonizes with heaven and earth, and their wondrous embodiment is spontaneous. Thus they empty themselves toward others, forgetful of all concerns, neither cherishing the myriad things nor treating the people as straw dogs. They act in accordance with this principle.

**Textual Notes:**
(1) The Tang manuscript omits "thing" after "者."
(2) In the phrase "犹其有物也," the Liu Deyi edition does not repeat the character.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, "I once heard the Master say, 'Do not send off, do not welcome.' May I ask about their wandering?"

**Exegesis:** Yan Yuan requests the Master’s teaching. To "send off" means to see off. The sage is like a mirror, neither sending off nor welcoming. Having heard this, Yan Yuan did not yet understand the principle, so he inquired of Confucius about its meaning.

Confucius said, "The people of antiquity transformed externally but remained untransformed internally. The people of today transform internally but remain untransformed externally. Those who transform with things are one with the untransforming. At peace with transformation and non-transformation, at peace with blending with them, they must blend without excess. The hunting parks of Xiwei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of Youyu, the halls of Tang and Wu—these were the masters of the Confucians and Mohists, who used them to engage in mutual disputation. How much more so the people of today! The sage dwells among things without harming them. One who does not harm things cannot be harmed by things. Only one who harms nothing can join others in sending off and welcoming. The mountain forests! The marshes and wilds!"

Let me bring forth joy that fills me with delight! Yet before the joy is complete, sorrow follows in its wake. Joy and sorrow come unbidden—I cannot resist their arrival, nor can I halt their departure. How lamentable! The people of this world are but transient lodgers in the realm of things.

They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. Yet ignorance and inability are inescapable for all. To strive to avoid what no one can escape—is this not also cause for sorrow?

Ultimate words transcend words; ultimate actions transcend action. To equal the knowledge of what knowledge knows is but shallow indeed.

---

Harmony is the state of accord. The masters of Confucianism and Mohism, who are the most difficult in the world to harmonize, can still be harmonized by those who are without intent—how much more so the ordinary! Harmony is the state of accord. The masters of Confucianism and Mohism, who endlessly dispute right and wrong, are the most difficult in the world to harmonize, yet the sage and the noble person can still follow and harmonize them. How much more so the people of this age, who are not masters of Confucianism or Mohism! To adapt and transform with them is only fitting.

Shih-wei, the Yellow Emperor, the sage-kings of Yu, Tang, and Wu, and the masters of Confucianism and Mohism—none fully embodied the Dao of inner transformation without change, and thus they arrived at disputes of right and wrong, showing that they still contended over such matters. Only when the five flavors blend and contend can harmony arise; thus it is called "accord."

Utmost compliance. Abiding in the worldly while blending one’s light, benefiting without harming—thus one does not injure. It rests with me alone. The empty boat and drifting tile, in perfect accord with all beings, are joyfully embraced by them, and so one dwells without harm.

Without intent, one attains utmost compliance; with utmost compliance, one can be without anticipation or reception, yet surpass those who anticipate and receive. Only by peacefully accepting all things, so that self and other remain unharmed, can one interact with the world and illuminate the truth that there is no reception, yet reception occurs.

Mountains, forests, riverbanks, and wilds are not inherently superior to me, yet I delight in them—this is joy without cause. Joy without cause is also sorrow without cause. Thus, all that brings joy is not truly joy, and all that brings sorrow is not truly sorrow. Ordinary emotions cling and fixate, falsely generating delight and aversion. Suddenly beholding towering mountains and lush forests, sacred riverbanks and secluded wilds, one feels joyful admiration, deeming it bliss. Yet before long, sorrow follows, for emotions shift with circumstances, and joy and sorrow transform. This is joy without cause, sorrow without cause—thus the world’s joys and sorrows are not worth reckoning.

One cannot sit in forgetfulness and attain self-realization, yet remains bound to joy and sorrow. An inn is a lodging for travelers. The coming of poverty and success cannot be warded off, nor can the departure of joy and sorrow be halted. Yet the common people, unversed in this truth, are like guests at an inn, detained by things, mistaking the illusory for the real—how deeply lamentable!

What knowledge encounters, it knows; what it does not encounter, it does not know. What one cannot do, one cannot force oneself to do. From this, we see that knowing and not knowing, being able and not being able, are not determined by me—they should be entrusted to nature.

Wisdom has its brightness and dimness, ability its skill and clumsiness; each is endowed with its inherent portion, which cannot be forced. Thus, what one’s portion encounters, one knows; what it does not, one cannot know. What one’s nature can do, one can do; what it cannot, one cannot. Like birds flying and fish swimming, spiders weaving webs and dung beetles rolling balls—following nature, is this not their inherent disposition?

My late uncle said: Each has what it knows, each has what it can do—there is no forcing one another; each has what it does not know, each has what it cannot do—there is no surpassing one another. To force what one knows to comprehend what one does not, to force what one can do to accomplish what one cannot, and then to claim this as knowledge or ability, to impose it upon the world and make all equal—this breeds contention over right and wrong and multiplies joy and sorrow. Therefore, forget what you know, and knowledge will naturally align; forget what you can do, and ability will naturally align. Ultimate words transcend words; ultimate actions transcend action. Having already forgotten oneself, how could one have leisure to equalize the world? Those who equalize the knowledge of what knowledge knows are those who, based on what they know, forcibly impose it upon the world.

Receiving life, each has its allotted portion. Since one is not a sage, one’s wisdom cannot encompass all things. Thus, knowing and not knowing, being able and not being able, are endowed differently, with each having its own mechanism. Yet the common people stubbornly resist what they cannot escape.

What humans cannot escape are matters beyond their allotted wisdom and ability. Yet the vulgar and base cannot accept their portion, so they strive with deluded clarity, seeking to uniquely escape—how profoundly foolish and deeply lamentable!

All is self-realization. The words of ultimate principle transcend words, so they are abandoned. The actions of ultimate principle transcend action, so they are abandoned.

Those who attain through knowledge are merely learners, thus their understanding is shallow. Seeing the worthy and thinking to equal them, abandoning oneself to emulate others, seeking principle through learning, employing knowledge to inquire into the Dao—this is superficial, not profound understanding.

**Chapter 23 of Miscellaneous Writings, Volume 8 (Part 1): "Gengsang Chu"**

This chapter is named after a person. Some versions title it *Gengsang Chu*.

Among the disciples of Lao Dan was one named Gengsang Chu, who had uniquely attained the Dao of Lao Dan. He went north to dwell in the mountains of Weilei. Those among his retainers who were cunningly clever departed from him, and those among his concubines who were ostentatiously benevolent kept their distance. Only the dull-witted remained with him, and the restless were employed as his servants.

After three years, Weilei flourished abundantly. The people of Weilei said to one another: "When Master Gengsang first arrived, we regarded him with surprise. Now, when we reckon our daily gains, they seem insufficient, but when we tally our yearly harvest, there is surplus. He must be a sage! Why do we not together honor him as our ancestral spirit, worship him as our earth deity, and revere him as our grain god?"

[2] [Annotation] *Huaran* refers to ostentatious cleverness; *qieran* refers to affected benevolence.
[Exegesis] Weilei is the name of a mountain, located in the state of Lu. "Retainers" are servants and slaves; "concubines" are attendants. This means that people regard benevolence and wisdom as servants and concubines, but Gengsang Chu entirely discarded benevolence and wisdom in his dealings with the noble-minded.

Having become a recluse, Chu dwelt in the mountains and marshes, his nature honest and unadorned, his heart disdaining superficial splendor. The men and women of the mountainside vied to serve him as retainers and concubines. Thus, those who were *huaran*—flaunting their cleverness to dazzle—he expelled and sent away; those who were *qieran*—affecting benevolence to set themselves apart—he caused to keep their distance.

[Philological Notes] *Wei* (畏) is sometimes written as *wei* (猥), both pronounced *wěi*. *Lei* (垒), in Cui’s edition, is written as *lei* (累), both pronounced *lěi*. Li Yi says: Weilei is the name of a mountain. Some say it is in Lu, others in Liangzhou. *Huaran* is pronounced *huò*. *Zhi* (知, "cleverness") is pronounced *zhì*, as in the annotation. *Qieran* is sometimes written as *qieran* (契), both pronounced *qiè*. Xiang Xiu says: It means "cleverness." Also pronounced *qiè*. The *Guangya* says: It means "to lift." *Yuanzhi* ("kept their distance") is pronounced *yuǎnzhī*. Sima Biao says: This means that people regard benevolence and wisdom as servants and concubines, but Gengsang discarded them entirely.

[3] [Annotation] *Yongzhong* means "uncarved simplicity."
[Philological Notes] *Yong* (拥) is pronounced *yǒng*. *Zhong* (肿) is pronounced *zhǒng*. In some editions, it is written as *zhǒng* (踵).

[4] [Annotation] *Yangzhang* means "self-contentment."
[Exegesis] *Yongzhong* and *yangzhang* both describe the appearance of unadorned self-contentment. Having discarded benevolence and wisdom, he returned to plainness, and so the simple and unrefined *shi* dwelt with him, while those of unbridled nature were employed as his servants.

[Philological Notes] *Yangzhang* is pronounced *yǎngzhǎng*. Guo Xiang says: *Yongzhong* means "uncarved simplicity"; *yangzhang* means "self-contentment." Cui Zhuan says: *Yongzhong* describes ignorance; *yangzhang* conveys an unfeeling manner. Xiang Xiu says: Both phrases describe rustic clumsiness. Sima Biao says: Both describe an ugly appearance.

[5] [Annotation] This is because he discarded wisdom and relied on foolishness.
[Philological Notes] *Darǎng* is pronounced *érzhǎng*. In some editions, it is written as *ráng* (穰). Cui’s edition is the same, also pronounced *ráng* or *rǎng*. The *Guangya* says: It means "abundance." Lu Wenchang notes: In the *Liezi*’s "Heaven’s Blessings" chapter, *rǎng* is also used for *ráng* (穰). *Sǎrán* is pronounced *sùtiǎn* or *xǐlǐ*. Cui and Li say: It describes a startled appearance. Xiang Xiu pronounces it *sūhěn*.

[6] [Annotation] One who moves in harmony with the four seasons seeks no immediate gains.
[Exegesis] *Darǎng* means "abundance." *Sǎ* describes a slight startle. After three years of dwelling there, the mountains flourished greatly. The people of Weilei said to one another in private: "When Gengsang Chu first arrived, we were slightly startled. Now, when we reckon our daily gains, they seem insufficient, but when we tally the year’s harvest, there is surplus. He must be a sage! For he moves in harmony with the four seasons, seeking no immediate gains—thus daily reckoning seems insufficient—but his distant virtue ensures that yearly reckoning yields surplus. The heavens complete a minor cycle every three years with an intercalary month, and so after three years, Weilei flourished abundantly."

[Philological Notes] *Rì jì zhī ér bùzú* ("daily reckoning seems insufficient"): Xiang Xiu says: There is no small profit from day to day. *Suì jì zhī ér yǒuyú* ("yearly reckoning yields surplus"): Xiang Xiu says: Following the seasons, there is great abundance.

[7] [Exegesis] *Shù* means "to admire"; *jī* means "near." *Shī* means "to preside over."

Gengsang, a man of great worth, admired and drew near to the virtue of the sage. Why not together honor him as lord, preside over the affairs of the southern throne, establish altars of soil and grain, build ancestral temples, and offer prayers and sacrifices according to ritual—would this not be excellent?

[Textual Notes]
(1) The character *shì* (飾) is amended following the commentary.
(2) The character *shì* (士) is restored following Liu Wendian’s corrected edition.
(3) The character *hěn* (很) is amended following the *Yunhui*; the Shidetang edition mistakenly omits it.

When Gengsangzi heard this, he faced south yet remained unsettled. His disciples found this strange.

[1] [Exegesis] Suddenly hearing that the people of Weilei would make him lord of the southern throne—this contravened the Way of non-action, so he was displeased. His disciples, not understanding this intent, were thus puzzled and found it strange.

Gengsangzi said: “Disciples, why do you find me strange? When the qi of spring stirs, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in due season, the ten thousand treasures ripen. Do spring and autumn achieve this by deliberate effort? The Dao of Heaven has already unfolded.”

[2] [Commentary] Spring’s generation and autumn’s fruition both accord with the natural Way, so no action is taken.
[Exegesis] Spring’s growth and autumn’s harvest are the constant workings of yin and yang; summer’s flourishing and winter’s storage are the regular patterns of things. Thus spring and autumn do not intentionally bestow upon the myriad beings—yet the natural Dao has already operated of itself, so one forgets the virtue of their arising and possessing.
[Philological Notes] *Zhèng dé qiū ér wàn bǎo chéng* (“when autumn arrives in due season, the ten thousand treasures ripen”): Heaven and Earth regard the myriad things as treasure, and by autumn they come to fruition. The Yuanjia edition reads *wàn shí* (“ten thousand fruits”). ◎ Yu Yue says: The character *dé* (得) is likely superfluous; the original text probably read *zhèng qiū ér wàn bǎo chéng* (“when autumn arrives in due season, the ten thousand treasures ripen”). The *Yi*’s *Shuogua* states: *Duì zhèng qiū yě* (“Dui corresponds to the proper autumn”), and “the myriad things rejoice in their completion.” The subcommentary says: “In proper autumn, the myriad things all rejoice in their completion.” This passage is evidence. The character *dé* (得) was likely mistakenly added due to the following sentence: *Fū chūn yǔ qiū qǐ wú dé ér rán zāi* (“Do spring and autumn achieve this by deliberate effort?”). The meaning of *chūn qì fā ér bǎi cǎo shēng, zhèng qiū ér wàn bǎo chéng* (“When the qi of spring stirs, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in due season, the ten thousand treasures ripen”) is already complete; there is no need to add *dé* (得) to create parallelism with the preceding line. *Dà dào yǐ xíng yǐ* (“The great Dao has already unfolded”): Some editions read *tiān dào* (“the Dao of Heaven”).

[3] [Commentary] They simply proceed of themselves, not through knowledge.
[Exegesis] Four walls, each one *du* (堵) in length, form an *huán dǔ* (環堵), what is called a “square-zhang chamber.” As still as a corpse, hence “dwelling like a corpse.”
[Philological Notes] *Huán* (環): Read as written. The *Guangya* says: “round.” *Dǔ* (堵): Pronounced *dīng lǔ*. Sima Biao says: “One *zhang* is called a *du* (堵).” *Huán dǔ* (環堵): Each side is one *zhang*, indicating its smallness.

[4] [Commentary] He did not wish to be a measuring mark for things.
[Exegesis] *Qièqiè* (竊竊): Whispering in pairs. *Zǔ* (俎): A stand for cutting meat; *dòu* (豆): A vessel for holding dried meat—both are ritual implements. The flock of dragons has no head: the sage’s guiding words.

Gengsangzi said: “Now, with the humble folk of Weilei whispering among themselves to place me among the worthies with ritual vessels—am I one to be measured? This is why I remain unsettled by the words of Lao Dan.”

[5] [No additional exegesis provided in the original.]

The cultivation of obscurity nurtures tranquility, leaving a path for later worthies to follow. Now, the petty folk of Weilei whisper in pairs, seeking to honor me as a worthy and revere me as their master—this is to make me a measuring mark for things. How could this be the way of one who dwells in reclusion!

[Philological Notes] *Zǔ dòu* (俎豆): Pronounced *cè lǚ*. Cui says: “*Zǔ dòu* means to set me among the common folk.” *Biāo* (杓): Guo reads as *dí*, also *pǐ yāo*, or *diào*. The *Guangya* says: “the tip of a tree.” Guo says: “to be a measuring mark for things.” Wang says: “This is to make oneself a target for others.” Xiang says: “Ma’s edition writes *diào*, pronounced *dí*.” *Biāo* (标): Pronounced *bì yáo*, also *bì xiǎo*.

[5] [Commentary] Lao Dan said: “When merit is accomplished and affairs are settled, the people all say, ‘We did this ourselves.’ Now, the folk of Weilei reverse this, which is why I am unsettled.”
[Exegesis] The Old Master said: “Achieve success without claiming it, lead without dominating.” Chu, having reverently received his teacher’s instruction, finds the people of Weilei acting contrary to this, and so remains unsettled.

[Textual Variants] (1) The character *chéng* (成) follows the *Shi De Tang* edition. (2) The modern edition reads *tiān dào* (天道).

The disciple said: “It is not so. In a ditch of ordinary size, great fish have no room to turn their bodies, and so the *ni* rule there; on a hillock of a few paces, mighty beasts have no place to conceal themselves, and so the fox becomes its omen. Moreover, to honor the worthy and empower the capable, to put goodness and benefit first—this has been so since the time of Yao and Shun, how much more should it apply to the people of Weilei! Master, you should listen to them!”

The disciple’s note states: “This means that great persons must possess abundant emolument.”

The subcommentary explains: A length of eight *chi* is called a *xun*; twice that is a *chang*. A distance of six *chi* is called a *bu*; seven *chi* make a *ren*. The *ni* is a small fish with legs—this is not the great fish *kun*. *Zhi* means “to dominate.” How could a ditch of mere *xun* and *chang* accommodate the circling of *kun* and *jing*? Yet the tiny *ni* fish is deemed fine there. A hillock of only *bu* and *ren* cannot conceal a mighty beast, yet the ominous fox is taken as an auspicious sign. Thus we know that great beasts must hide in deep mountains, and great persons require generous emolument.

The *Shiwen* glosses:
- *“Xun-chang ditch”*: Eight *chi* make a *xun*; twice a *xun* is a *chang*. A *xun-chang* ditch corresponds to the breadth and depth of the *xu* and *kuai* in the *Zhou Ritual*. The *xu* is eight *chi* wide and deep; the *kuai* is two *xun* wide and two *ren* deep.
- *“To turn its body”*: Pronounced *xuan*, meaning “to revolve.” Cui’s edition reads *dai*.
- *“Ni”*: Pronounced *wu-xi*. The character *qiu* is pronounced *qiu*.
- *“Dominates it”*: The *Guang Ya* states: *Zhi* means “to bend.” That is, the small fish can twist and turn. Wang comments: *Zhi* means “to dominate,” as the *ni* monopolizes the small ditch.
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Shiwen* says *zhi* means “to bend,” meaning the small fish can twist and turn. *Zhe* (“to break”) and *zhi* (“to control”) were originally interchangeable characters. The *Book of Lü*’s “*zhi* with punishment” is cited in the *Mozi* as “*zhe* then punish”; in the *Analects*’ “Yan Yuan” chapter, “a word can *zhe* a lawsuit” appears in the Lu *Analects* as “can *zhi* a lawsuit”—this is evidence.
- *“A hillock of bu and ren”*: Six *chi* make a *bu*; seven *chi* make a *ren*. It is one *bu* wide and one *ren* tall. Kong Anguo says: eight *chi* make a *ren*. The *Xiao Er Ya* states: four *chi* make a *ren*.
◎ Jia Shifu says: Water is where fish gather; hills and mounds are where beasts gather. Even a *xun-chang* ditch or a *bu-ren* hillock must have something that gathers there, for there is something to take refuge in. The greater the virtue, the more gather to it. Guo Xiang’s use of the great fish and beast as metaphors, saying that great persons must have abundant emolument, is mistaken.
- *“Qiu”*: Pronounced *yu-jie*.
- *“The fox becomes its omen”*: Li comments: *Xiang* means “portent.” Foxes and raccoon dogs are inauspicious. Each has its proper place; if the proper place is not lost, then great persons possess abundant emolument. Wang comments: Wild foxes rely on it to create omens. Cui comments: The *gu* fox takes the small hill as good fortune. *Xiang* means “good.”

The subcommentary to the second note explains: To honor the worthy and elevate the capable, to put goodness first and bestow its benefits—even the sage-kings Yao and Shun acted thus. How much more should the people of Weilei! Master, as one who comprehends all things, should deign to listen!

Master Gengsangzi said: “Come, my disciple! The beast that can hold a carriage in its mouth, once it leaves the mountain in its solitude, cannot escape the disaster of nets and snares. The fish that can swallow a boat, once it drifts and loses the water, is tormented by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not disdain the heights, and fish and turtles do not disdain the depths.

The note states: To avoid harm and distance oneself from profit is to be whole.

The subcommentary explains: That beast is so vast its mouth can hold a carriage; once it stands alone and leaves the mountain, it cannot escape the disaster of nets and snares. The fish that can swallow a boat is no small creature; once it drifts and loses the water, ants can harm it. Thus birds and beasts seek high mountains, and fish and turtles seek deep waters—is this love of the unusual? It is to preserve their bodies and avoid harm. If even birds and fish act thus, how much more should humans!

The *Shiwen* glosses:
- *“Han”*: Pronounced *han*.
- *“The beast that holds a carriage”*: Li comments: A beast as large as a carriage. Another says: large enough to hold a carriage.
- *“Stands alone”*: Pronounced *jie*. The *Guang Ya* says: “alone.” Also pronounced *gu-xia*. One edition reads *fen*, meaning “to separate.” The Yuangjia edition is the same.
◎ Yu Yue says: The *Fangyan* states: a beast without a mate is called *jie*. One edition reads *fen*—incorrect.
◎ Qingfan notes: *Jie* in the *Shiwen* appears in one edition as *fen*. *Fen* and *li* (“to leave”) form a coherent meaning, so the edition reading *fen* is correct. In ancient texts, *jie* was written as *fen*; *fen* was later corrupted to *jie* (介), and the two shapes being similar, transcription errors are common. The *Guliang Zhuan* for the 30th year of Duke Zhuang reads: “Yan Zhouzi *fen*zi”; the *Shiwen* notes: *fen* appears in one edition as *jie*. The *Zhou Ritual*’s *Da Zongbo* commentary on “pheasants take their heads *jie* and die” notes: *jie* appears in one edition as *fen*. The *Chunqiu Fanlu*’s “Establishing the Origin and Spirit” chapter has *jie* blocking perilous terrain, where *jie* is a corruption of *fen*. The *Huainanzi*’s “Miu Cheng” chapter says: “Disasters arise *fen-fen*,” which Wang Niansun emends to *jie-jie*—this is evidence.
- *“Leaves the mountain”*: Pronounced *li-zhi*. Below and in the note, the same.
- *“Swallow a boat”*: Pronounced *chi-en*, also *tian*.
- *“Drifts and loses the water”*: Pronounced *tu-lang*, meaning to drift and lose the water. Cui’s edition reads “leaves the water and dwells on land.”
- *“Then ants”*: Pronounced *yu-qi*.
- *“Torment it”*: Read as written. Xiang comments: Ma’s edition reads *zui* (“most”), also *qiong* (“exhaust”).

The note to the second passage states: If one entangles oneself in emolument and salary, one is coarse and shallow.

The subcommentary explains: *Miao* means “distant.” Those who retire to preserve their lives must distance themselves from the dust of the world and deeply enter mountains and springs. If one entangles oneself in emolument and salary, one is coarse and shallow.

The *Shiwen* glosses:
- *“Deep and distant”*: Pronounced *mi-xiao*.
- *“Coarse”*: Pronounced *qi-nu*.

All subsequent instances follow the same pattern.

Moreover, how could these two men ever be worthy of praise! In their disputations, they are like those who recklessly breach walls only to plant thistles and weeds. Combing their hair strand by strand, measuring rice grain by grain—how could such petty fastidiousness ever serve the world! Promote the worthy, and the people will contend; entrust the rapacious, and the people will steal. These few measures are not enough to enrich the people. The people’s pursuit of profit is so relentless that fathers are murdered by sons, rulers by ministers; in broad daylight they commit robbery, and at noon they bore through walls. I tell you: the root of great disorder must have arisen in the age of Yao and Shun, and its branches will endure for a thousand generations. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another!

---

**Note to the first passage:**
The two men refer to Yao and Shun.

**Subcommentary:**
The two men refer to Yao and Shun. The sagely traces of Tang and Yu are the root of disorder among men—how could they be worthy of praise!

**Shiwen Gloss:**
*“The two men”*: Xiang, Cui, and Guo all say: Yao and Shun.

---

**Note to the second passage:**
This will cause later generations to recklessly engage in breaches and plant defilement and chaos.

**Subcommentary:**
This will cause later generations to recklessly engage in breaches and plant defilement and chaos. *Bian* means “to distinguish.” To establish the ways of Yao and Shun outside the nature of things and teach later men to imitate their traces is like breaching a fine wall only to plant thistles and weeds as a barrier.

**Shiwen Gloss:**
*“Thistles”*: Pronounced *pu-kong*.
*“Will cause”*: Pronounced *li-cheng*.

---

**Note to the third passage:**
This is like managing the tip of an awl.

**Subcommentary:**
It is like carefully selecting and combing each hair or measuring each grain of rice for cooking—such trivial benefits are far outweighed by the harm.

**Shiwen Gloss:**
*“And comb”*: Pronounced *zhuang-bi*. Also written as *栉* or *楖*, all equivalent. Guo reads *jie*; Xu reads *ce-ji*.
◎ Lu Wenchang notes: Modern texts write *栉*.
◎ Wang Yinzhi notes: The *Shiwen* reads *扻* as *zhuang-bi*, also written as *栉* or *楖*, all equivalent. Guo reads *jie*; Xu reads *ce-ji*. According to the *Yupian*, *扻* is pronounced *ku-gan*, meaning “to strike.” It cannot be read *zhuang-bi* or *jie*. *扻* should be *□*, the same as the *□* in the *Yupian*. In clerical script, the hand radical was mistakenly moved to the left. The *Yupian* reads *□* as *qi-zi*, meaning “to grasp.” Here it is borrowed for *栉* (“to comb”), hence the pronunciations *zhuang-bi* and *jie*. Characters with the *ci* phonetic may be read as *ji* or *jie*. The *Shuowen* states: *Ci* (堲), to enlarge a road with earth, from *tu* (土) and *ci* (次) as phonetic. The ancient form *{堲}* (一) is from *tu* (土) and *ji* (即) as phonetic, citing the *Book of Yu*: “My *ji* (堲) slanderous words and perverse conduct.” The *Yupian* reads *cai-zi* or *cai-ji*. The *Shuowen* states: *Zi* (咨), a bracket, from *mu* (木) and *zi* (咨) as phonetic. *Zi* (咨) is from *kou* (口) and *ci* (次) as phonetic, as in “mountain *jie* (节) and painted beams.” The *Kang Gao* reads: “Do not employ *ci* (次) to enfeoff your daughter.” The *Xunzi*’s *Zhi Shi* chapter cites this, writing *ci* as *ji*. These are all examples.

「□ is the *comb* in "to comb one's hair," and should be read with the *rù* (入) tone. However, since its character uses *cì* (次) as the phonetic component, it may also be read with the *qù* (去) tone, hence Xu Mì’s pronunciation as *cè-jì* (侧冀反).

*《Shùmǐ》* (数米) reads *sè-zhǔ* (色主反).
*《Érchuī》* (而炊) reads *chāng-chuí* (昌垂反).
Xiàng (向) says: "This is but minor profit-seeking." **[IV] [Annotation]**: "Mixed and unified, without restraint, this is no way to bring about salvation."

**[Cushí] (疏)**: "Following the traditions of Yao and Shun, yet indulging in private scheming—this is but a petty Dao, how can it suffice to save the world!"
**[Shìwén] (释文)**: "*《Qièqiè》* (窃窃) as the character reads."

Sīmǎ (司马) says: "Whispered speech."
Another interpretation: "The appearance of calculating and measuring."
Cuī (崔) reads it as *chá-chá* (察察).

**[V] [Annotation]**: "When one suppresses and frustrates their nature to await what they truly cherish."
**[Shìwén] (释文)**: "*《Yà》* (轧) reads *wū-qiè* (乌黠反), Xiàng (向) pronounces it *yǐ* (乙).
*《Lì-fú》* (戾拂) reads *fú-fú* (符弗反).

**[VI] [Annotation]**: "If truth is insufficient and one relies on knowledge to follow, then it becomes falsehood. Falsehood in pursuit of life—what else is this but theft?"
**[Cushí] (疏)**: "Yà (轧) means harm. When one promotes the worthy and assigns tasks based on ability, prioritizing knowledge over virtue, then deception and rivalry flourish, and a hundred schemes of theft and trickery arise. The paths of competition open wide, and thus mutual harm ensues."

**[Shìwén] (释文)**: "*《Rènzhī》* (任知) is pronounced *zhì* (智). The annotation is the same."

**[VII] [Annotation]**: "Nothing left to look back upon."
**[Cushí] (疏)**: "Counting things" refers to promoting the worthy and assigning tasks based on knowledge. This teaching fosters superficiality and cannot cultivate the sincerity and virtue of the common people. Yet the people’s greedy hearts are ever eager for gain, and private resentments and grievances give rise to regicide and treason, endangering the state. They commit theft in broad daylight, assaulting cities and breaching walls at noon.

**[Shìwén] (释文)**: "*Yǒushā* (有杀) pronounced *shì* (试). The original also reads *shì* (弒). The same below. *Xuèhuài* (穴坏) pronounced *pǔhuí* (普回反). Xiàng (向) pronounced *péi* (裴), saying: *huài* (坏) means "wall." This speaks of having nothing to fear or restrain. ◎Qìng Fān’s annotation: □ is the same as *péi*. In *Huáinánzǐ*’s *Qísú* (齐俗) chapter, "凿培而遁之" (high walls breached to flee), Gāo Yù’s annotation says: *péi* (培) is the rear wall. (*Qísú* chapter must include acts of burrowing, scaling, and leaping over □—deliberate transgressions.) □ is also the same as *péi*, hence Gāo’s annotation: □ is the rear wall. *Lǚshì Chūnqiū*’s *Tīngyán* (听言) chapter also uses *péi*, while *Hànshū*’s *Yáng Xiōng* biography uses *huài*, with slight phonetic variation but identical meaning.

**[VIII] [Annotation]**: "Emperor Yáo and Shùn left their traces, yet false adornments spread afterward, leading to these calamities."
**[Cushí] (疏)**: The refined deference of the Tang and Yù dynasties gave way to treasonous chaos. The roots of this disorder trace back to Yáo and Shùn, and their ill effects persist for a thousand years—Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows, devouring one another.

**[Shìwén] (释文)**: "*Wúyǔ* (吾语) pronounced *yújù* (鱼据反). *Nǚ* (女) pronounced *rǔ* (汝). The same below.

**[Jiào] (校)**:
**(1)** The character *qí* (堲) is supplemented according to *Shuōwén Jiězì*.
**(2)** The character *jiān* (奸) is corrected according to the original *Huáinánzǐ* text.

Nán Róng *zhì* (趎), sitting upright with a solemn demeanor, said: "If one of my age has already grown old, where then shall I entrust my Dao to reach such words as these?" **[1]**

**[1] [Cushí] (疏)**: Nán Róng, given name *Zhì* (趎), was a disciple of Gēngsāng.

「Shùrán—an expression of startled awe—betokened Nán Róng’s demeanor. Upon hearing this teaching, his heart filled with reverence and admiration. Thus, with solemn composure and earnest sincerity, he humbly sought further instruction:

*"Zhì is old, his spirit dimmed by age—upon what learning may I rely to grasp such words as these?"*

**[Shìwén]**: *Nán Róng Zhì* is pronounced *Chāngyú* (昌于反), *xiàng* (向) as *chóu* (畴), *yī* (一) as *shàojù* (绍俱反) or *xúzhí* (徐直俱反), and also *chùjù* (敕俱反) or *chǔyóu* (处由反). Lǐ [Xingzhong] notes: "A disciple of Gēngsāng." The *Hànshū* *Gǔjīn Rénbiǎo* records him as *Nán Róng Chóu*. Some texts render his name as *tóu* (俦) or *shòu* (寿). The *Huáinánzǐ* writes *Nán Róng shuì* (帱), describing him as *"kèluó bùxī"* (欶蹻趹步), ceaselessly marching a hundred *shè* without rest. Others also use *chóu* (畴). ◎ Lú Wénpiàn remarks: *"The current text of Huáinán Xiūwù Xùn reads chóu (畴). The earlier 'kèluó' (欶蹻) was corrupted as 'chùmiǎn' (敕蟜); now corrected according to the original text."* Gāo Yù’s annotation explains: *"Kè (欶), like zhù (箸); luó (蹻), footwear; bù (步), to hasten. Kè is pronounced 'jiǎo' (角); luó as 'qiè' (略); bù as 'jué' (决). Zhù is 'zhuó' (着), pronounced 'zhí' (直略); bù (趋), to stride. Some versions omit 'bù' (步), a missing character."*

Gēngsāngzǐ replied:
*"Preserve your form intact **[1]**, cherish your life **[2]**, and let no restless scheming cloud your mind. If you abide thus for three years, then you may attain these words **[3]."**

「**[1]** **[Annotation]** *Guard your allotted portion.* **[Reading]** *Its portion* is pronounced *fú-wèn* (扶问).
Later interpretations sought meaning beyond the text.

**[2]** **[Annotation]** *Do not grasp at anything beyond your life.* ◎ **Yú Yì** remarks: *The Shīmíng* (释名) under *Shì Zīróng* (释姿容) states: *"Bào (抱), to preserve; xiàng qīn bǎo (相亲保), to protect what is close."* This shows that *bào* (抱) and *bǎo* (保) share the same meaning. *Bào rǔ shēng* (抱汝生) is equivalent to *bǎo rǔ shēng* (保汝生). Gāo Yù’s annotation—*"Do not grasp at anything beyond your life"*—takes *bào* (抱) literally, failing to grasp its figurative usage through *fǎjiè* (假借).

**[3]** **[Exegesis]** When the mind ceases to chase external phenomena, it attains *quánjué* (全角, "preservation of the whole"). To *guard one’s allotted portion* (守其分内) and *preserve one’s life* (抱生者) is to cultivate stillness. Once the division is rectified and life preserved whole, the spirit concentrates and the body relaxes, so no further exertion of thought or worry is needed. Only after three years of *xūjìng* (虚静, "emptiness and tranquility") can one truly reach these words. This is the teaching of **Gēngsāngzǐ** to **Nán Róng**.

**[Reading]** *Thinking* is pronounced *xī-lì* (息吏). Same as below. **Nán Róng** replied:
*"The eye and its form—I do not know their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves;
The ear and its form—I do not know their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves;
The heart and its form—I do not know their difference, yet the mad cannot find themselves.
**[1]** The form and its form are also divided**[2]**, yet external things may interfere with this, making it so that one seeks the other but cannot attain**[3]**.
Now you tell me, **tréng**[4]: *'Preserve your form, cherish your life, and let no restless scheming cloud your mind.'*
**Tréng**, I strive to hear the **Dao/Way** and understand its depths!"**[5]**»

**[1] [Annotation]** The eye with the eye, the ear with the ear, the heart with the heart—though their forms resemble one another, their capacities differ. If they differ, then one cannot imitate or emulate the other.
**[Commentary]** The blind and the deaf do not differ in outward form from ordinary people with sight and hearing, yet the blind cannot perceive colors, and the deaf cannot hear sounds. The mad and the sane may appear alike in appearance, yet the mad lose their nature and cannot find themselves. **Nán Róng** cited these three instances to illustrate the unity of the body—how one may fail to grasp the **Dao/Way**’s deepest truths just as the blind and deaf fail to perceive the world. Hence, the *Inner Chapters* state: *"It is not only the physical form that is blind and deaf—even wisdom may be so."*

**[Textual Notes]** *可* (kě) is pronounced *qì-zhàng* (其丈反). The same applies below.

**[2] [Annotation]** [The forms] have not yet been closed off.
**[Textual Notes]** *亦辟* (yì pì) is pronounced *bì-yì* (婢亦反), meaning "open." **Cuī** (崔) says: "It means *relative*." Pronounced *bì-yì* (必亦反).
◎ **Jiāshì Fù** (家世父) says: **Guó Xiàng**’s annotation—*"The form and its form are also divided"*—means *"have not yet been closed off."* The *Textual Notes* explain: *辟* (pì), pronounced *bì-yì* (婢亦反), means "open." This is a homophonic substitution. **Zhèng Kāngchéng**’s annotation on the *Great Learning* states: *辟* (pì) means *"to illustrate."* The *Shuōwén Jiezi* (说文解字) under the *Speech* radical says: *"Pì (譬), to illustrate."* The *Fāng Jì* (坊记) uses *pì* (辟) for *"prevent"* and *"compare,"* while the *Zhōng Yōng* (中庸) uses it as *"like walking far"* and *"like ascending high."* *Pì* (辟) and *pì* (譬) are interchangeable, both meaning *"to illustrate."* **Guó Xiàng**’s annotation is incorrect. The *Han Shū* (汉书) *Bào Yǒng Zhuan* (鲍永传) says: *"Those who speak are a warning; those who hear are not yet enlightened."* **Cháng Huái Tàizǐ**’s annotation says: *"Pì (譬), to make clear."* To be clear about the similarity between forms is also to illustrate.

**[3] [Annotation]** Though the two forms are open, they cannot attain one another—there is an obstruction between them.
**[Commentary]** *Pì* (辟) means "open." *Jiàn* (间) means "distinction." The blind and the sighted both have open orifices, yet sight and blindness create a distinction in perception. The blind and deaf seek hearing and seeing, yet they cannot attain them—just as **Nán Róng** seeks enlightenment but finds no path to it.
**[Textual Notes]** *或间* (huò jiàn) is pronounced *jiàn-chè* (厕之间). The annotation is the same.

**[4] [Annotation]** Early separation by form makes transformation difficult.
**[Commentary]** *"Preserve your form, cherish your life"* has been explained as before. The repeated emphasis on *"hearing"* clarifies the question’s intent.
**[Textual Notes]** *勉闻道* (miǎn wén dào): **Cuī Xiàng** (崔向) says: *"Miǎn (勉), ‘also.’"* The original text may have a missing character. *达耳矣* (dá ěr yǐ): **Cuī Xiàng** says: *"Only reaching the ears, not penetrating the heart."*

**Gēngsāngzǐ** said:
*"My words are exhausted. The bumblebee cannot transform into a cicada, the wild chicken cannot brood over a duck’s egg, but the domestic chicken can. The chicken and the chicken—though their *virtue/power* is not inherently different, some can and some cannot, for their innate capacities differ in magnitude. My capacity is small, insufficient to transform you. Why not go south to see **Lǎozǐ**?"* **[2]**

「**[1] [Exegesis]**
The *bumblebee* (奔蜂) refers to the slender-waisted ground wasp. *Breast* (藿) means *bean*. *Shuǎi* (蠋) is the large green grub found in beans. *Yue chicken* (越鸡) is the *Jing chicken* (荆鸡). *Lu chicken* (鲁鸡) is what we now call the *Sichuan chicken* (蜀鸡). The slender-waisted wasp can transform silkworm larvae into its own offspring but cannot transform *bean grubs*. The *Jing chicken* is small and cannot brood over a *wild goose’s egg*; the *Sichuan chicken*, being larger, can. This illustrates that my capacity is inferior and cannot yet transform you—my words have exhausted their meaning.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Delun* (奔蜂): Pronounced *fù-gōng* (孚恭). Sima [commentary] says: "A small wasp." Another reading: "Ground wasp."
*Huǎi shuǎi* (藿蠋): Pronounced *shù* (蜀). Sima [commentary] says: "The large green grub in beans."
*Yueji* (越鸡): Sima Xiang says: "A small chicken." Another reading: "Jing chicken."
*Neng fú* (能伏): Pronounced *fú-yòu* (扶又).
*Hú* (鹄): Also written as *hè* (鹤), same meaning. Pronounced *hù* (户各) or *hù* (户沃).
*Luán* (卵): Pronounced *lì-guǎn* (力管).
*Luji* (鲁鸡): Sima Xiang says: "A large chicken, the Sichuan chicken of today."
**[Regulatory Note]** *Tai Ping Yu Lan* (太平御览) 918 cites Sima [commentary]: "Yue chicken: small chicken. Lu chicken: large chicken, the Sichuan chicken of today." Slightly different from the *Release Text* citation.

**[2] [Exegesis]**
The chicken possesses five virtues: wearing a crest (礼), having spurs (义), calling one another when feeding (仁), knowing the seasons (智), and facing enemies with courage (勇). Though the *Jing* and *Lu* chickens differ in size, their five virtues are the same. Their ability or inability lies in their innate capacities—some large, some small. I am like the *Jing chicken*, my capacity insufficient to transform you. Why not journey south to seek **Lǎozǐ** as your teacher?

**[Collation Note]**
**[1]** The text is missing a character in the *Jiangnan Ancient Cang* and *Li-Zhang* editions, reading: *"Nánróng Zī yíngliáng"* (南荣趎赢粮), arriving at **Lǎozǐ**’s place in seven days and seven nights.
**[1] [Exegesis]**
*Yíng* (赢): To wrap or carry. With ardent reverence for the Sage, he traveled without rest, day and night, for seven days before seeing **Lǎozǐ**.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Yíngliáng* (赢粮): Pronounced *yíng* (盈). According to *Fāngyán* (方言), *yíng* means *dàn* (儋), used in Qi, Chu, Chen, and Song regions. Another reading: *guǒ* (果).
**[Annotation]** Lu Wénpiàn notes that the pronunciation *guǒ* may also be written as *luǒ* (裸).

**Lǎozǐ** said: *"Are you from the place of Sanchu?"*
Nánróng Zī said: *"Yes."* **[1]**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
*Zì* (自): "From." Asking: "Are you coming from the land of Sanchu?"
Nánróng Zī replied with *"Wéi"* (唯), a respectful affirmative sound.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Yuē wéi* (曰唯): Pronounced *wéi* (惟癸).

**Lǎozǐ** said: *"Why did you come with so many others?"*
Nánróng Zī, startled, looked behind him. **[2]**

**[1] [Annotation]**
He came with three companions, hence the rebuke.

**[Exegesis]**
*Xiè* (偕): Together. **Lǎozǐ**, the Sage, discerned his motives like a mirror. Though he had not yet abandoned *ren* (仁) and *yì* (义), he reproached him for bringing others. The logic was that he had come with three companions, so he mocked him for claiming a larger group.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Xiè sān* (挟三): Pronounced *xié* (协).

**[2] [Exegesis]**
*Jùrán* (惧然): A startled expression. Not yet understanding **Lǎozǐ**’s words, he was suddenly told of the others behind him, glancing back in fear of many people.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Jùrán* (惧然): Pronounced *jù-jì* (向纪俱). Also written as *jié* (戄), same sound, or *qiú* (况缚).
**[Regulatory Note]** *Jùrán* is the same as *qǔrán* (瞿然), an expression of surprise. The original character is missing. *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字): *"Qǔ"* (九遇切), lifting one’s eyes in startled surprise. *Qǔ* and *jù* are both borrowed characters. *Lǐ Dàn Gōng* (礼檀弓) uses *qǔ* for *"incidentally startled."* *Shǐjì Mèngzǐ Zhuan* (史记孟子传) and *Hànshū Huì Jì Zhǎn* (汉书惠纪赞) also use *qǔ* in similar contexts.

**Lǎozǐ** said: *"Do you not understand what I mean?"* **[1]**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
*Wèi* (谓): Speech or intent.

I spoke together with you, yet you mock me for arriving with these three precepts. You looked behind you—this shows you did not grasp my meaning.

Nánróng Zǐshì bowed his head in shame, then raised his gaze and sighed, saying:
*"Just now, I forgot my response and lost my question."*

**[1]**
**[1] [Exegesis]**
*Bowing*: lowering the head in shame. Recognizing his own ignorance and failing to comprehend the Sage’s words, he thus lowered his head in humiliation, raised his eyes to the sky in sighing, his spirit dazed, his emotions in disarray. Was it merely that he lost his composure? He had also lost his inquiry.

**[Textual Notes]**
*"Factor lost my question"* (因失吾问): The *Yuánjiā* edition reads *"hear"* (闻) instead of *"question"* (问). **Qìngfān’s Note**: *"Question"* (问) is synonymous with *"hear"* (闻). In ancient usage, they were interchangeable. In *Lúnyǔ—Gōngyě Cháng* (论语公冶长), *"Hearing one thing, knowing ten"* (闻一知十), the *Shìwén* (释文) notes: *"Hear"* (闻) was originally written as *"question"* (问). In *Xuánzǐ—Yáo Wèn* (荀子尧问), *"Not hearing the things"* (不闻即物), *Yáng Shè* (杨倞) comments: *"Hear"* (闻) was sometimes written as *"question"* (问).

**[Correction]**
**[1]** The two characters were supplemented based on context.

**Lǎozǐ** said:
*"What do you mean by this?"* **[1]**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Asking what meaning lies in his words.

Nánróng Zǐshì replied:
*"Do I not know? People call me *zhūyú*—a fool.
Do I know? Yet practicing virtue brings me sorrow upon my body. **[1]**
To act without *rén* harms others; to act with *rén* brings sorrow to myself.
To act without *yì* injures others; to act with *yì* brings sorrow to myself.
How can I escape this? These three precepts are my afflictions—I wish to ask about them through Sāng Chǔ."* **[2]**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
*Zhūyú*: like being utterly foolish, without knowledge. If one remains mired in ignorance and worldly confusion, one earns the name of foolishness. If one applies wisdom in human affairs, one risks bodily harm. Since the harm falls upon oneself, it is said to bring sorrow to the body.
**Family Tradition Note**: In the *Zuǒzhuàn—Shuānggōng Sìnián* (左传襄公四年), *Dù Yú* (杜预) annotates *"zhūrú"* (朱儒) as *"short and stunted."* *Zhūyú* thus refers to one whose wisdom is stunted and small.

**[2] [Exegesis]**
*Rén*: the practice of universal love.
*Yì*: the function of fulfilling proper order.
Both are the teachings of the ancient sages, yet they are not means to preserve the self or avoid harm. Thus, acting without *rén* or *yì* harms others; practicing them risks betraying true nature and the Dao. I do not yet know how to reconcile this within my heart to avoid such afflictions. I entrust these three precepts to Sāng Chǔ as an intermediary, hoping you will grant me an answer below.

**[Correction]**
**[1]** The character *"make"* (使) was altered to match the preceding clause.

**Lǎozǐ** said:
*"Earlier, I observed you within the space of my eyebrows and eyelashes, and thus I came to know you. Now you speak, and your words confirm it. **[1]**
You are so meticulously troubled, as if you had lost your parents, and now you raise a pole to seek the sea. Alas, you are a lost soul! How bewildered you are! **[2]**
You wish to return to your true nature and innate endowment, yet you have no path to enter—how pitiful!"* **[3]**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Earlier, I observed your form and demeanor, and thus I discerned your heart. Now your spoken words align with the three precepts you hold. Your speech thus verifies my understanding.

**[Textual Notes]**
*"Toward me"* (向吾): Also written as *"toward"* (向) in some editions, same meaning.
*"Eyebrows and eyelashes"* (眉睫): Pronounced *jié* (接). *Shìmíng* (释名) states: *"The hairs of the eyes."* **[2] [Exegesis]**
*Guīguī*: finely fragmented, as in overanalyzing. You apply your mind in such fragmented ways to these three precepts, like a child who has lost its parents. You are like someone in *Dàn* (儋) raising a pole to seek the sea, attempting to measure its depths—how could this succeed? You are a person who has lost the true self and the Dao, a drowning child adrift, with no clear path to return.

**[3] [Exegesis]**
You seek to restore your original nature and innate endowment, yet you lack the means to do so—this is truly lamentable.

「[Textual Notes]
*Guīguī*: Li Yun: "Loses the divine appearance." Another reading: "Fine and minute appearance."
*Ruò sàng*: Pronounced *xīlàng* (息浪). Gloss same as above.
*Jiē*: Pronounced *qílì* (其列) or *qíyè* (其谒).
*Gān*: Pronounced *gān* (干).
*Er qiú zhū hǎi yě*: Xiàng Yun: "Speaking of using a small, limited thing to measure the vast depths of the sea."
*Nǚ wáng rén zāi*: Cuī Yun: "A person lost in nature and innate disposition."

**[3] [Exegesis]**
Though you cling to the traces of the sages, drowning in the virtues of *rényì* (仁义), even if you strive to return to your original nature and innate endowment, your afflictions have already taken root—there is no way to enter (the Dao). The great sage’s compassion is profound, and this is truly lamentable.

South *Róngzhuó* (荣趎) sought to enter and take refuge in the dwelling, called forth what you love, and removed what you hate. After ten days, he grew troubled and again saw the Old Master.

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Having lost the object of inquiry, his understanding and awareness became dim. Thus, he withdrew to his home, reflecting for a decade, searching for the Dao’s virtues he favored, and eliminating the virtues of *rényì* (仁义) he despised. Unable to grasp the Dao, he fell into sorrow, hoping to seek further instruction, and thus again saw the Old Master.

[Textual Notes]
*Suǒhǎo*: Pronounced *hūbào* (呼报).
*Qù qí*: Pronounced *qǐlǜ* (起吕).
*Suǒwù*: Pronounced *wūlù* (乌路).
*Fù yòu*: Pronounced *fúyòu* (扶又).

The Old Master said:
“You have washed yourself, but your *yùyù* (郁郁) still lingers—how could it be so? Yet within you, there remains a *jīnjīn* (津津) still—there is still evil there **[1]**.
Those whose *wéi* (外) is bound cannot be seized with urgency; instead, they must be closed within **[2]**.
Those whose *nèi* (内) is bound cannot be seized with earnestness; instead, they must be closed without **[2]**.
Those whose both *wéi* (外) and *nèi* (内) are bound—even the Dao’s *virtue/power* (德) cannot sustain them, let alone those who abandon the Dao and act recklessly **[3]!”**

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Returning home for a decade, he discarded the Five Virtues (五德), cleansed and purified his defilements and accumulated merits. From my observation of your *qi* (气), it is *yùyù* (郁郁) yet calm—though you exert effort, the *jīnjīn* (津津) still leaks through. Thus, I verify that evil remains.

[Textual Notes]
*Sǎzhuó*: Pronounced *dàjiǎo* (大角).
*Yùyù*: Cuī Yun: "How could it be so?" (孰洒貌).
*Jīnjīn*: As the character. Cuī Yun: "Lǜlǜ" (律律), meaning "evil appearance" (恶貌).
*Yóu yǒu wù yě*: Lǐ Yun: "Evil schemes still linger" (恶计未尽也).

**[2] [Gloss]**
*Bàn*: "To close" (关闭).
Ears and eyes are the *external* (外); the mind and methods are the *internal* (内).
To fully embrace life and preserve it, nothing is better than forgetting your internal methods and abandoning your external senses.
If one’s external senses are bound by sounds and colors, then one’s internal mind is clogged within.
If one’s internal mind is bound by cravings and aversion, then one’s external senses are lost without.
Only when there is neither gain nor loss can one be said to be in harmony.

**[Exegesis]**
*Wéi* (韄) means "to bind or constrain."
*Bàn* (揵) means "to close."
*Fán* (繁) means "urgency."
*Miù* (缪) means "earnestness."
It is said that if a person’s external senses (ears and eyes) are bound by sounds and colors, then their internal spirit is closed off within.
If one’s internal mind and wisdom are bound by cravings and aversion, then their external senses are closed off without.
This mutual binding is a natural consequence.
Even if one tries to restrain with the mind, seize with urgency, or earnestly weave nets, there is no way to achieve harmony.
Only when the spirit is settled within and the senses are still without can one align with the Dao’s way of preserving life.

[Textual Notes]
*Wài wéi*: Xiàng Yun: Pronounced *huò* (霍). Cuī Yun: "Vast and expansive" (恢廓也). Also as the character.
This word is also written as *wéi* (韄), pronounced *huò* (获), *yǐhuó* (乙虢), *wūmiào* (乌邈), or *jī* (羁). Lǐ Yun: "To bind" (缚也).
*Shū* (三苍): "To adorn with a sword and bow" (佩刀靶韦也).
◎Lú Wénfǎn: "Now written as *wéi* (韄)."
*Ér zhuō*: Xu Yun: Pronounced *zéjiǎo* (侧角).»

「崔作促，云：迫促也。
*[Inner] Wéi*: Pronounced *jìniàn* (郭其辇反), *qíyǎn* (徐其偃反).
*Guan*: "To close" (关也).
*Xiàng*: Also pronounced *jiǎn* (蹇), same below.
*Miào*: Pronounced *mòhóu* (莫侯反), also *chóu* (稠), meaning "to bind" (结也).
*Cuī Xiàng*: "To weave and bind" (绸缪也).

◎Yú Yì said: "Guo provides no annotation here, yet annotates the following text: *Even if one uses both hands to seize it, weaving nets to hold it, one cannot stop it.* Thus, interpreting *fán* (繁) as *fánshǒu* (繁手) is surely untenable. *Fán* is likely a corruption of [□]. □, colloquially written as *jiǎo* (缴). In the *Han Shu* biography of Sima Xiangru, *míngjiā kēchá jiǎo rào*, Xu Sheng says: *Jiǎo rào* means *to entangle*. Here, [□] and *miào* (缪) are used together—[□] refers to *jiǎo rào* (entangling), *miào* refers to *chóu miào* (weaving and binding). The *Guang Ya* explains that [□] and *chóu miào* both mean *to entangle*—their meanings are identical. □ and *fán* resemble each other in form, leading to the error."

◎Jiāshì Fù said: "The *Shuowen Jiezi* states: *Wéi* (韄) is the silk cord for a sword belt. Xu Shí said: *Silk* refers to its binding threads. The *San Cang* states: *Péi dāo bǎi wéi* (佩刀靶韦). Thus, *wéi* conveys the meaning of binding and tying. *Wài wéi* (外韄) means to restrain the ears and eyes;"

「The governance of the ears and eyes grows chaotic and convoluted, shifting and multiplying beyond grasp—then one must internally restrain the heart to still the restless movements of the ears and eyes. *Internal wéi* (韄) means to restrain the heart; yet when the heart is entangled and erratic in a hundred ways, it too cannot be grasped—then one must externally restrain the ears and eyes to sever the heart’s connections. When both internal and external are restrained, one enters a state of profound oblivion, forgetting both self and Dao/Way, with no reliance or attachment; then even virtue/power cannot penetrate and take root—how much more so can the lingering of malevolent desires persist!

Guo Xiang said: "When sounds and sights are restrained externally, the heart’s faculties grow clogged internally; when desires and evils are restrained internally, the ears and eyes are lost externally. Even partial restraint is not possible—how much less so when both internal and external are restrained!" This seems not to be Zhuangzi’s original intent.

【Three】【Annotation】 Partial restraint is not possible; how much less so when external and internal are both restrained! If the ears and eyes are dazzled and confused externally while the heart’s faculties wander unrestrained internally, even if one uses both hands to seize them and weaves and binds them tightly, one cannot stop it.

【Exegesis】 Partial fixation at the edges already contradicts natural spontaneity; how much more so when internal and external are both drowned in restraint, deepening the confusion. Even if there are scholars who cherish Dao/Way and virtue/power, they still cannot uphold it—how much less so for those who abandon the lofty Dao/Way and solely pursue this confusion, hoping to achieve restraint?

The *Laozi* says: "The *Sutras of Vitality* (衛生之經) —can one embrace the *One* (一)?
Can one refrain from losing it?
Can one know auspicious and inauspicious without divination?
Can one cease (action)?
Can one stop (desire)?
Can one abandon others and seek within oneself?
Can one be effortlessly light?
Can one be unstrained and at ease?
Can one be like a child?
A child all day cries yet its throat never grows hoarse—this is the ultimate harmony.
All day grasping yet its hands never tire—this is the fulfillment of virtue/power.
All day gazing yet its eyes never blink—its focus is not external.
It moves without knowing where it goes,
It acts without knowing what it does,
It flows with things in harmony,
Yet remains aligned with their Dao/Way.
This is the *Sutras of Vitality* already.

【Annotations】
【One】 Do not depart from its nature.」

**Commentary:**

The *True* is guarded without division. **[2]**
**[Annotation]** Returning to self-acquisition. **[2]**

**Commentary:**
Self-acquisition of its nature. **[3]**
**[Annotation]** When aligned, it is auspicious; when excessive, it is inauspicious—no need for divination.
**Commentary:**
Treading the Dao/Way brings auspiciousness; yielding to things brings inauspiciousness. This is the natural order—why consult divination?
◎ Wang Yansun remarks: *"Auspicious and inauspicious"* should read *"inauspicious and auspicious."* The rhyme demands *"lost auspicious"* (失吉), and *"cease"* (止) rhymes with *"self"* (己).

In *The Heart-Methods* of *Guanzi*, it asks: *"Can one focus entirely? Can one embrace the One? Can one know auspicious and inauspicious without divination?"* This confirms it.
(*In the Inner Cultivation Chapter, "auspicious and inauspicious" is also mistakenly reversed, but not in The Heart-Methods.*)

**Textual Notes:**
*"Aligned"* (当则) — *Dinglang* rhyme. This is omitted later. **[4]**
**[Annotation]** Ceasing at one’s proper measure.
**Commentary:**
Not pursuing beyond one’s measure. **[4]**
**[Annotation]** No lingering on past traces.
**Commentary:**
What has passed is not pursued. **[5]**
**[Annotation]** Preserving oneself without imitating others.
**Commentary:**
*"Seeking"* (诸) — *"at"* (于). Abandoning the intent to imitate others, pursuing the Dao/Way of oneself. **[6]**
**Textual Notes:**
*"Abandon"* (舍) — pronounced *shè*. Same below. **[6]**

**[Annotation]** No lingering traces.
**Commentary:**
Moving and resting without constraint. **[7]**
**Textual Notes:**
*"Effortlessly light"* (翛然) — pronounced *xiāo* (like *xiāo* in "whisper"), or *yù* (like "nurture"). Cui’s version reads *"random"* (随), meaning *"to follow."* **[7]**

**[Annotation]** No obstruction.
**Commentary:**
Flowing with things without contrivance. **[8]**
**Textual Notes:**
*"Unstrained"* (侗) — also written *tóng* (*Dàdǒng* rhyme), or *tòng* (*Xiàngchù* rhyme), meaning *"straight without burden."* The *Sān Cāng* says: *"[壳] [直]"* — appearance of straightness. Cui agrees. The *Zìlín* says: *"Great."* ◎ Lu Wēnpán notes: Now written as *tóng*. *"Obstruction"* (碍) — *Wǔdài* rhyme. **[8]**

**Commentary:**
Like a child. **[9]**
**[Annotation]** Sound emerges naturally, not from joy or anger.
**Commentary:**
*Sē* (嗌) — throat constriction. *Shā* (嗄) — voice breaking. Qi flows freely, the heart untouched by joy or anger, so all day it cries yet the throat neither constricts nor breaks. Pure harmony preserved, reaching this state. **[10]**
**Textual Notes:**
*"Cries"* (嗥) — *Hùgāo* rhyme. Also written *háo* (same sound). **[10]**

「《而嗌》—*Yì* (益). Cui says: *"throat."* Sima says: *"throat."* Li reads it as *è* (厄), meaning *"choked."* One version reads *"while not choked"* (而不嗌). Case: As Li’s reading, it includes *"not"* (不). *《不嗄》—Yú-Mài* (于迈) rhyme. Also written *yōu* (嚘), with Xu pronouncing it *yōu* (忧). Sima says: *"The Chu people call utter silence ‘sé’ (嗄)."* Cui’s version reads *hè* (喝), meaning *"mute."* ◎Yu Yì says: The *Shìwén Jié* (释文) states that *sé* (嗄) was originally *yōu* (嚘), with Xu pronouncing it *yōu* (忧)—this should be followed. Laozi’s *"all day cries yet not choked"* (终日号而不嗄) was written as *□* (嚘) in Fu Yi’s version, another variant of *yōu*. In *Yáng Zhī Tàixuān Jīng* (扬子太玄经), *"Three days of softness"* (夷次三日柔), *"the infant cries"* (婴儿于号), *"three days without yōu"* (三日不嚘)—both Song-era editions by Lu and Wang follow this. Clearly, *yōu* rhymes with *rǒu* (柔), proving that *Yáng Zhī*’s Lao-Zhuang texts used *yōu* (嚘).

**[11] [注]** *Rèn shǒu zhī zì wò, fēi dú dé yě.* **[11]**
**[疏]** *Jū jì* (拘寄), *[while not]* laboring or wearying—this is because their pure harmony and Daoist virtue align with the utmost Dao.

**[释文]** *《终日握》—Lǐ yùn:* *"To curl the hands"* (卷手曰握). *《不》—Wǔlǐ* (五礼) rhyme, *xiàng* (向) pronounced *yì* (艺). Cui says: *"to hold."* *Guǎng Yǎ* says: *"to grasp."* ◎Yu Yì says: *Shuōwén* has no such character. Under the *jiǎo* (角) radical: *bì* (觬), meaning *"to curve."* Likely this character. If speaking of the horn, it uses *jiǎo*; if speaking of the hand, it uses *shǒu*—thus *bì* (觬) transforms into *wò* (握), showing how characters multiply over time. *"All day the hands grasp yet do not [curl]"*—meaning the hands do not clench into fists. Cui says: *"to hold"*—this is incorrect.

◎Jiāshì Fù says: The *Shìwén Jié* cites Cui as saying *"to hold"* (寄), and *Guǎng Yǎ* says *"to grasp"* (捉). Now, examining *Yáng Xióng Tàixuān*’s *"Xuan"* (玄), it says: *"The praises of the Dao sometimes use qi, sometimes use likeness, sometimes use completed things."* *"Wò"* (握), meaning *"to imitate."* Xióng’s intent is to use *"wò"* as *"nǐ"* (拟). *Shuōwén* says: *"Nǐ"* means *"to measure."* Meaning there is no standard to measure or infer. *Shuōwén* says: *"Gòng"* (共) means *"same."* Whether seizing things or taking things, it is done without measuring—its virtue is the same. *"Gòng qí"* (共其) follows the character. Cui says: *"One"* (壹)—incorrect.

**[12] [注]** *Rèn mù zhī zì jiàn, fēi xì yú sè yě.* **[12]**
**[疏]** *Shùn* (瞬), meaning *"to move."* The eyes move naturally, yet the gaze does not flicker—it does not linger on external dust.

**[释文]** *《不瞬》—Also written *shùn* (瞬), same meaning. Pronounced *shùn* (舜), meaning *"to move."* Sometimes written *míng* (瞑), pronounced *mò* (莫). *《偏不》—Xu* pronounces it *piān* (篇).

**[13] [注]** *Rèn zú zhī zì xíng, wú suǒ qù.* **[13]**
**[疏]** *Zhī* (之), meaning *"to go."* Like a boat drifting without tether, thus though it moves, it has no fixed destination.

**[14] [注]** *Zòng tǐ ér zì rèn yě.* **[14]**
**[疏]** *Tián zhuì wúwéi* (恬惔无为), the utmost stillness and emptiness.

**[15] [注]** *Sī shùn zhī yě.* **[15]**
**[疏]** *Wěi wù wúxīn* (接物无心), bending and following naturally.

**[释文]** *《委》—Yú-Wēi* (于危) rhyme. *《蛇》—Yǐ-Zhī* (以支) rhyme.

**[16] [注]** *Wù bō yì bō.* **[16]**
**[疏]** *Hé guāng hùn jì* (和光混迹), blending like waves in the current.

**[17] [疏]** *Zǒng zhǐ yǐqián, jié chéng [qí] yì yě.* Nán Róng Zhì says: *"Then is this the virtue of the Perfect One? [1]"*

**[1] [注]** *Ruò [yī] néng zì gǎi ér yòng cǐ yán, biàn yù zì wèi zhìrén zhī dé.* **[1]**
**[疏]** As previously discussed in the *Yángshēng Jīng* (卫生之经), following it aligns with the Dao. Is this the virtue of the Perfect One?

**[校]** *[Yī]—Zhào Jiànyì’s version omits "Ruò" (若) and "biàn yù zì" (便欲自).*
*"No! This is what is called ‘ice melting, frost thawing’—can it be done? [1]*
**[1]**
The Perfect One—*xiāng yǔ jiāoshí hù dì ér jiāolè hù tiān* (相与交食乎地而交乐乎天), not clashing over profit or harm among people and things, not regarding each other as strange, not plotting against each other, not scheming together—*qiáorán ér wǎng, tóngrán ér lái.* This is called the *Yángshēng Jīng* (卫生之经) already. [4]"

**[1] [注]** *Néng hū* (能乎), clarifying it is not natural. **[1]**
**[疏]** Nán Róng was constrained by Confucian *rén yì* (仁义), his days long bound. Now hearing the Sage’s teachings, he finally understands *yángshēng* (卫生). Like winter ice encountering spring sun—his rigid heart now melts and disperses. This is enlightenment through learning, not innate nature. *"Néng hū"* (能乎) clarifies it is not true. This is Laozi’s reply to Zhì.

**[释文]** *《冰解》—Pronounced *xiè* (蟹).*
**[2] [注]** *Zì wú qí xīn, jiē yǔ wù gòng.* **[2]**
**[疏]** The Perfect One has no emotions, responding to things as they arise—thus able to share the people’s nourishment from the earth and commune with all beings in Heaven’s joy. *"Jiāo"* (交) means *"to share."*

**[释文]** *《交食》—Cui says: "Jiāo"* means *"together."* Li says: *"shared."* *《交乐》—Pronounced *luò* (洛).*
◎Yu Yì says: Guo’s annotation says, *"Selflessly, all things are shared."* The *Shìwén Jié* cites Cui as saying *"jiāo"* means *"together,"* and Li says *"shared."* None truly grasp the meaning of *"jiāo."* In *Xú Wúguǐ Piān* (徐无鬼篇), it says: *"I share joy with them in Heaven, I share nourishment with them on Earth."* Though the meaning differs, the intent is the same. *"Jiāo"* means *"to invite"*—anciently written as *"jiào"* (徼). In the *Lùn Yú* (论语), *"Wén Èr"* (文二年), *"The Duke of Lu wishes to invite blessings from Duke Zhou and Duke Lu."* Here, *"jiào fú"* (徼福) is akin to *"jiào shí hù dì"* (邀食乎地) and *"jiào lè hù tiān"* (邀乐乎天)—the phrasing is identical in meaning.

「作邀者后出字，作交者假借字。 *Shī* *Sāng Hù Piān* (《桑扈》) says: *"彼交匪傲"* (彼交匪傲), the *Hàn Shū* *Wǔ Xíng Zhì* (《汉书·五行志》) renders it as *"匪儌匪傲"* (匪儌匪傲)—this is the precedent.

**[三]**
◎ **[Cù]** says: *"Rǎn"* means *"to disturb."* The **至人** (Perfect Person) maintains a **虚心** (empty heart), aligning with the **世** (World), and rides the waves with all things. Thus, they can pacify the strange and unnatural among the masses, and cut off schemes and plots from the common folk. If they do not treat external affairs as their own concerns, how could **利害** (gain and loss) ever disturb them!

**[Shìwén]** *《Xiàng Rǎn》* (《相撄》) is read *"yú yíng"* (于营), Xu also pronounces it *"yīng"* (婴).
The *Guǎng Yǎ* (《广雅》) states: *"to disturb."* Cui says: *"akin to **贯** (pierce/penetrate)."*

**[四]**
◎ **[Cù]** says: Repeating the earlier passage to conclude its meaning.
**[Jiào]** (校) The second *"无"* (without) is removed according to the correct text.
It says: *"Then is this the **至** (Perfect) **Dao/Way**?"*
**[一]【注】** *"Does this mean that by merely hearing this, one can attain the Perfect Dao/Way?"*
**[Cù]** says: *"Hearing this, one can attain the utmost heights."* Nán Róng (南荣) being unlearned, repeats the question to Lǎo Jūn (老君).
Lǎo Jūn says: *"Not yet. I have already told you: 'Can you **养子乎** (nourish your own children)?"*

「【一】'When one's **children** (子) move, they act without purpose; when they walk, they go without direction. Their body is like a withered tree's branch, and their mind is like extinguished ashes【二】.
If such is their state, calamity will not come, and fortune will not arrive. Calamity and fortune are absent, yet who would dare to speak of human disasters! 【三】”

【一】【注】This does not mean that calamity is absent because of these words, but rather that those who merely hear them without practice cannot attain the Perfect Dao/Way by themselves.
If it does not come from oneself, then even hearing the Perfect words, one can only use them as scripture—how could one truly attain the Perfect Dao/Way?
Thus, the learned do not attain it, and those who attain it do not rely on learning. 【疏】The words *"能"* (able) are an encouraging exhortation.
Though these words are profound, they are still like **fishing nets and traps** (筌蹄), for once it is said *"吾固告汝"* (I have already told you), one must then **absorb and cultivate** (因禀学) them.
Yet the learned do not attain it, and those who attain it do not rely on learning—this is because the **nature of the Perfect Dao/Way** (筌) is beyond ordinary understanding, hence *"未也"* (not yet).
This is **Lǎo Jūn**’s repeated answer to **Nán Róng**.

【二】【疏】In **emptiness, stillness, and repose** (虚冲凝淡), utterly **serene and without attachment** (寂寞无情), their being aligns with a withered tree that does not flourish, and their mind resembles extinguished ashes that forget warmth.
With **body and mind thus forsaken** (身心既其双遣), how could their actions and movements be known?
This is the **essence of longevity** (卫生之要).

【释文】*《若槁》* pronounced *"kǔ lǎo"* (苦老).

【三】【注】Calamity and fortune arise from **gain and loss** (得丧), while human disasters stem from **affection and aversion** (爱恶).
Now, if one’s body is like a withered tree and mind like extinguished ashes, reaching the utmost **detachment** (无情), then affection and aversion, gain and loss, come of their own accord.

【疏】Indeed, calamity and fortune spring from **gain and loss** (得丧), and human disasters arise from **beauty and ugliness** (美恶).
Now, if one’s form is like a withered tree and mind like extinguished ashes, forgetting both gain and loss, forsaking beauty and ugliness,
they are still without **obscurity and confusion** (冥昧), so how could human disasters exist?

【释文】*《恶有》* pronounced *"wū"* (乌).
*《爱恶》* pronounced *"wū lù"* (乌路).
Same below.

**Those whose virtue and bearing are serene and steadfast** (宇泰定) emanate from **the luminous Dao/Way of Heaven** (天光)【一】.
Those who emanate from **the luminous Dao/Way of Heaven** (天光) are seen by others as **the luminous Dao/Way of Heaven** (人见其人)【二】,
and **objects see their own nature** (物见其物).
【一】People who **cultivate the Dao/Way** (修) have **constancy** (恒)【三】;
those with **constancy** (恒) are **abandoned by others** (人舍), yet **assisted by Heaven** (天助)【四】.
What others abandon is called **Heaven’s people** (天民);
what Heaven assists is called **Heaven’s child** (天子)【五】.

【一】【注】When one’s **virtue and bearing are serene and steadfast** (德宇泰定), their emanation is **the luminous Dao/Way of Heaven** (天光), not human brilliance.

【疏】The body is the dwelling of the spirit, so the Perfect Sage is likened to a vessel of **virtue and bearing** (道德).
Moreover, when **virtue and bearing are serene and steadfast** (德宇安泰) and **quietly settled** (静定), their emanation of **spiritual illumination** (发心) and **perception of things** (照物) comes from **natural wisdom** (自然之智光).

【释文】*《宇泰定》* **Jiāshìfù** says: *"器宇"* (instrumental bearing) refers to the **calm and expansive bearing** (器宇闲泰) that leads to stillness and steadfastness.
**Wáng** says: *"器宇"* (instrumental bearing) refers to the **calm and expansive bearing** (器宇闲泰), meaning that when one’s bearing is calm and expansive, it is settled and steadfast.
◎ **Jiāshìfù** (家世父) says: *"In an empty chamber, white purity is born; in stillness, auspiciousness abides.
The human heart naturally reveals its inclinations, and **the luminous Dao/Way of Heaven** (天光) shines forth—this is natural and cannot be concealed.
Cultivate what is natural, and the responses will come.
Each person cultivates themselves, and each person perceives themselves, hence *"人见其人"* (people see their own nature).*

【二】【注】When **the luminous Dao/Way of Heaven** (天光) naturally emanates, others see **their own nature** (人见其人), and objects see **their own nature** (物见其物).
Each perceives their own nature without seeing others’, hence their **serene and steadfast bearing** (泰然而定).

【疏】Ordinary people cannot fathom the Sage’s perfection; they only see them among the masses, unaware of **the luminous Dao/Way of Heaven** (天光) extending far.

【三】【注】When one **cultivates the Dao/Way in others** (修人), they attain it themselves—this is why they maintain **serene and steadfast bearing** (常泰).

【疏】**Constancy** (恒) means **permanence** (常).
Though **the Dao/Way transcends learning** (绝学), its cultivation still requires **seeking** (资求).
Thus, those who truly **cultivate the Dao/Way** (真修) can converge on the **permanent and settled Dao/Way** (凝常之道).

【四】【注】Because they maintain **permanence** (常泰), they can **return to their dwelling** (反居我宅) while naturally **receiving Heaven’s assistance** (获助)【二】.

【疏】Those who embody **permanence** (体常), in all their actions meet with **auspicious harmony** (吉会),
are **abandoned by the common folk** (苍生之所舍止) and **assisted by Heaven** (皇天之所福助)—is this not fitting?

【五】【注】When they **act in the world**, they are **Heaven’s child** (天子); when they **remain in seclusion**, they are **Heaven’s people** (天民).
These two states both arise from **serene and steadfast bearing** (泰然而自得), not from **effort** (为).

【疏】When they **act in the world**, they become **rulers and sovereigns** (君后); when they **remain in seclusion**, they are **free and virtuous individuals** (逸人).
All achieve this through **embodying the Dao/Way and maintaining permanence** (临道体常), hence their **attainment of such merit** (致斯功).

【校】（一）The four characters *"物见其物"* (objects see their own nature) are added based on the missing text and **Zhāng Jūnfáng**’s (张君房) version and commentary.
（二）**Zhào Jiànyì**’s (赵谏议) version lacks the two characters *"自然"* (natural).

**The learned** (学者) are those who **learn what they cannot learn** (学其所不能学);
**those who act** (行者) are those who **practice what they cannot practice** (行其所不能行).

The **discerner** discerns what he cannot discern.
To know and stop at what he cannot know—this is the utmost attainment;
If there is anything that does not conform to this, the **Heavenly Balance** will undermine it.

---
**【One】** *Commentary*: Whatever one is capable of, even if one acts, it is not *forcing*; even if one practices, it is not *learning*; even if one speaks, it is not *discerning*.

**Exegesis**: When one acts within one’s proper sphere, though one acts, it is not *forcing*—thus, though one learns, it is not *learning*; though one practices, it is not *practicing*; though one discerns, it is not *discerning*. How much less would one *force* beyond one’s sphere to learn what one cannot?

**Textual Note**: *"The learned learn what they cannot learn"*—this speaks of how all people desire to know what they cannot know. Whatever they are capable of, they are thus capable of what they are capable of. Those who are capable of what they are capable of—even if they practice, it is not *practicing*.

---
**【Two】** *Commentary*: What one cannot know, one cannot force oneself to know; thus, stopping here is the utmost (achievement).

**Exegesis**: Following what one is capable of and stopping within one’s proper sphere, one does not force oneself to know what one cannot. This is the most refined state of approaching learning.

---
**【Three】** *Commentary*: Though the mind may wish to *force*, the act will inevitably fail, and reason will ultimately prevent it.

**Exegesis**: If one’s heart strays beyond one’s sphere and does not regard what is within one’s sphere as correct, this is to undermine one’s innate nature.

**Textual Note**: *"Undermine it"*—read as *méi* (迈), or alternatively as *zé* (则). The *Yuán Jiā* edition reads *zé*.

---
**Collation**: (One) The *Shì Dé Táng* edition includes the character *yě* (也).

---
To **provide all things to shape form**,
To **store the unforeseen to nurture the mind**,
To **hold reverence centrally to reach the other**—
If this is so, yet all evils arrive,
They are all **Heaven’s doing**, not **human doing**,
Unworthy of **corrupting completion**,
Unfit to be **internalized in the Spirit Hall**.

The **Spirit Hall** has what it holds,
Yet it does not know what it holds,
And what cannot be held—it cannot hold.

---
**【One】** *Commentary*: Following one’s own preparedness and aligning with the shaping of form.

**Exegesis**: *Jiāng* (将) means *to align*. The vast furnace of creation and transformation is complete in all things; one need only align with their formed nature and inquire into the principles of learning.

**Textual Note**: *"Provide all things"*—*bèi* (备) means *complete*. *Jiāng* (将) means *to align*.

「【Two】 *Commentary*: The mind naturally generates intention—it is not premeditated but arises spontaneously.
*Exegesis*: The sage of perfect attainment has no fixed emotions; when things stimulate him, he responds in kind. He encompasses holy wisdom, and when encountering things, his mind arises naturally—never premeditating or scheming beforehand.

*Textual Note*: *"Intention"*—*亿度* (yìdù), pronounced as *yì-luò* (待洛反).

【Three】 *Commentary*: The Dao/Way naturally illuminates all—it is not a matter of inner arrogance while outwardly revering.
*Exegesis*: The *"central"* (中) refers to inner wisdom, the *"other"* (彼) to external circumstances. Holding one’s divine intelligence in reverence, one dare not trifle with it. When wisdom is concentrated and tranquil, and circumstances are clear and open, the Dao/Way is naturally understood.

【Four】 *Commentary*: Heaven’s principles inherently possess their own limits and depths.

【Five】 *Commentary*: When one acts and brings about evil, that is the doing of humans.
*Exegesis*: Take the case of King Wen’s imprisonment in the *Yǒu Lì* (羑里), or Confucius’困困 at the hands of the people of *Kuāng* (匡). Their wisdom was not lacking, nor were they unworthy sages—yet they encountered such boundless misfortunes and adversities, for it was due to the *Heavenly timing* (天时) and *destiny* (运命). How could such evil be their own doing?

【Six】 *Commentary*: Accepting it as one’s fate, thus their completion is not corrupted.
*Exegesis*: *"Corrupt"* (滑) means *disorder* (乱). Those who embody the Dao/Way and grasp truth are at peace with their times and understand destiny. Even if they face boundless evils, they cannot disorder the mind of great completion.

*Textual Note*: *"滑"* (húan) is pronounced as *"骨"* (gǔ).

【Seven】 *Commentary*: The *Spirit Hall* (灵台) is the mind—clear and unobstructed, so that worries and troubles cannot penetrate it.
*Exegesis*: *"Internalize"* (内) means *enter*. The *Spirit Hall* is the mind. Its subtle essence is empty and tranquil, so that worldly affairs cannot enter its *Spirit Hall*.

*Textual Note*: *Guō Yún* (郭云) says: *"The Spirit Hall is the mind."* It is said that the mind has *spiritual wisdom* (灵智) capable of holding and maintaining. *Xǔ Shèn* (许慎) says: *"Above the human heart, where the *qi* travels."* ◎ *Yú Yì* (俞樾) says: *"The phrase ‘万恶不可内于灵台’ (millions of evils cannot be internalized in the Spirit Hall) should not be deleted, as the text above reads: ‘If this is so, yet all evils arrive, they are all Heaven’s doing, not human doing, unworthy of corrupting completion,’ which already suffices. The evils that cannot be internalized in the Spirit Hall are then further explained below. The passage below reads: ‘The Spirit Hall has what it holds, yet it does not know what it holds, and what cannot be held—it cannot hold.’ All of this follows from the previous statement. Readers who do not carefully examine the meaning mistake that ‘万恶不可内于灵台’ (millions of evils cannot be internalized in the Spirit Hall) belongs with ‘不足以滑成’ (unworthy of corrupting completion), thus deleting ‘万恶’ (millions of evils). The *Wén Xuǎn* (文选) *Guǎng Jué Jiāo Lùn* (广绝交论) by *Lǐ Shàn* (李善) quotes this text correctly, reading ‘万恶不可内于灵台’ (millions of evils cannot be internalized in the Spirit Hall)." *Gāo Shān Sì* (高山寺) manuscript reads *冥* (míng) instead of *闲* (xián).

【Eight】 *Commentary*: The *"has what it holds"* (有持) refers to the mind’s immobility toward things—yet in truth, it does not hold.
*Exegesis*: Only the noble mind that can hold is said to hold, yet it does not know the reason for this.

【Nine】 *Commentary*: If one knows what the mind holds, then it holds.
*Commentary*: To hold is to lose.

*Exegesis*: If there is a mind that clings and holds, it will lose it far away. Thus, it is not possible.

When one does not see his sincerity in action—
Every action is misguided,
Every deed is taken on without abandon—
Every (misguided) action further leads to loss.

Evil done in the light of day—humans can punish it;
Evil done in secret—ghosts can punish it.

Only when one understands both humans and ghosts can he walk alone.

*Textual Note*: *"不见其诚己而发"* (Not seeing his sincerity in action) refers to not reflecting inward while outwardly rushing.

【One】 *Commentary*: This is the false action of reckless intention.
*Textual Note*: *"Every action is misguided"*—*丁浪反* (dīng-làng fǎn). The *Ěr Yǎ* (尔雅) says: *"Every"* (每) means *"even though"* (虽). It refers to even though there is action, it does not hit the mark.

【Two】 *Commentary*: Intention arises not from one’s own sincerity—how can it be correct?
*Exegesis*: Earlier, those who openly obtained the Dao/Way had their wisdom illuminated and clear. Below, those who lose their true understanding have their minds confused and contrary to reason. *"Sincerity"* (诚) means *"reality"* (实). Without first reflecting on the reality of wisdom, one recklessly gives rise to false intentions. Since the mind is not true, every intention is contrary to reality and thus misguided.

*Textual Note*: *"幽闲"* (yōu-xián) is pronounced as *"闲"* (xián).

【Three】 *Commentary*: Affairs do not stay within their proper place.

*Exegesis*: *"Deed"* (业) means *"affair"* (事). Worldly affairs disturb and agitate—each time they enter the mind, one does not grasp their violation or compliance, so they cannot be abandoned.

【Four】 *Commentary*: Intention arising from one’s own sincerity is what is called *obtaining*.

*Exegesis*: Every time one recklessly gives rise to false intentions, following previous circumstances, one thinks it is obtaining—yet it further loses truth.

【Five】 *Exegesis*: Humans and ghosts, secret and open, are said to be different paths. Yet when one pushes sincerity and fulfills truth, there is no separation between Dao/Way and reason. If one goes against their proper place and loses truth, they will inevitably invite retribution and response. Enmity and resentment are felt in kind—this is why they are punished, as in the case of *Dù Bó* (杜伯) and *Péng Shēng* (彭生).

*Textual Note*: *"镆"* (yú) is pronounced as *"金耶"* (jīn-yē).

Those who dwell within the *Spirit Hall* (券内者) walk in the *Nameless* (无名);
Those who dwell outside the *Spirit Hall* (券外者) aspire to *periodic profit* (期费).

Walking in the *Nameless*—only the *Yong* (庸) can shine;
Aspiring to *periodic profit*—only the merchant can do so,
But when people see his *foot* (跂), they regard him as *proud and arrogant* (魁然).

Those who exhaust themselves with things—things enter them;
Those who exhaust themselves with *moderation* (且)—their own bodies cannot contain them, how much more could they contain others?

Those who cannot contain others have no kin;
Those with no kin abandon all humans,
For *war is not more cruel than ambition*,
And *no place to escape in Heaven and Earth*.

*Textual Note*: *"券"* (quàn) here refers to the *Spirit Hall* (灵台). *"无名"* (wúmíng) is the *Nameless* (无名). *"期费"* (qīfèi) refers to *periodic profit* (期费). *"跂"* (qì) means *foot*. *"魁然"* (kuírán) means *proud and arrogant*. *"且"* (qiě) means *moderation*. *"尽"* (jìn) means *abandon*. *"镆"* (yú) is pronounced as *"金耶"* (jīn-yē). *"阴阳"* (yīnyáng) refers to *Heaven and Earth* (天地).

The inner self, dwelling within its proper bounds, acts in accordance with the *Nameless* **[1]**.
Those who stray beyond their allotted measure, their ambitions lie in *periodic profit* **[2]**.
To dwell within bounds and act in the *Way* is to move without leaving a trace **[3]**.
To fix one’s resolve on *periodic profit* is the way of the merchant **[4]**.
When others see their *foot* **[5]**, they appear *proud and arrogant* **[6]**.

The one who exhausts himself with things—things enter him;
The one who exhausts himself with *moderation* **[7]**—his own body cannot contain him, how much more could he contain others?

Those who cannot contain others have no kin;
Those with no kin abandon all humans,
For *war is not more cruel than ambition*,
And *no place to escape in Heaven and Earth* **[8]**.

It is not *Heaven and Earth* that harm them—
Their own hearts are what drive them to ruin **[9]**.

---
**[1]** *Textual Note*: **"券"** (quàn) means *bound/allotted measure*. The inner self, confined to its proper domain, acts without regard for reputation.
**[2]** *Textual Note*: **"期费"** (qīfèi) refers to *extreme expenditure*—the relentless pursuit of profit, akin to *gluttonous extremes* (綦).
**[3]** *Textual Note*: **"庸"** (yòng) means *utilize*; those aligned with the *Way* act without leaving a name or trace.
**[4]** *Textual Note*: **"贾人"** (gǔrén) refers to *merchants*—those who fix their resolve on profit, trading in what they do not inherently possess.
**[5]** *Textual Note*: **"跂"** (qì) means *to tiptoe or strain*—here, the outward display of ambition.
**[6]** *Textual Note*: **"魁然"** (kuírán) means *arrogant and self-assured*, though others perceive their precariousness.
**[7]** *Textual Note*: **"且"** (qiě) retains its prior meaning of *moderation*—here, the futile attempt to restrain excess.
**[8]** *Textual Note*: **"镆(金耶)"** (yú/jīn-yē) as *war*; **"阴阳"** (yīnyáng) as *Heaven and Earth*—the ultimate bounds of existence.
**[9]** *Textual Note*: The harm stems not from external forces but from the self’s corrupting desires.

「The impoverished truly manifest their sincerity through their actions, yet the merely *moderate* [且] only align with one another in their shallowness.

To *aspire* [志] to *appointments* [期会] is to *moderate* [且], while to act in *namelessness* [无名] is to exhaust their intentions. Thus, they can fully realize their purpose.

**[6]** *Textual Note*: **"穷"** (qióng) means *completion*—the beginning and end.
*Explication*: It refers to *abiding* [舍止].

Those who align with the *Dharma* [物] and *Self* [我] in profound resonance and exhaust the *principles* [理] to their *essence* [性] are thus dependent on external things.

**[7]** *Textual Note*: **"且"** (qiě) refers to *those who strain outward* [□外而跂者].
*Explication*: The *tiptoeing* [跂] cannot stand firm—how can they then *comport themselves* [自容]?
If they cannot *comport themselves*, how can they *comport others* [容人]?
When one fails to be *comported*, they depart.

*Explication*: They merely *dally* [涉] with others in superficiality, *moderating* [苟且] in vain pursuits of fleeting fame and profit. Though their bodies remain *proud and haughty* [矜企], their minds are restless in *competition* [躁竞], unable to *comport themselves*—how then can they *comport external things* [容物]?

*Suggested Reading*: In *"The Treatise on Things"* [《物且》], **"且"** (qiě) is pronounced with the *initial* [始]. ◎ *Yu Yue* [俞樾] notes: **"且"** (qiě) is the same as *merely moderate* [苟且].
In the *Ode* [《诗》] *"Dongmen"* [《东门之枌》] passage *"Gudan"* [谷旦] at *"Chai"* [差]*,* the *Han Commentary* [《韩诗》] reads *"Jian"* [旦] as **"且"** (qiě)**,** saying: *merely moderate* [苟且].
This is a *repetition* [重言] for *merely moderate*, while the *single term* [单言] is **"且"** (qiě)**.
The preceding text, where *things* [物] and *exhaustion* [穷] are discussed, *Guo Xiang* [郭象] notes that **"穷"** (qióng)** means *completion*—the beginning and end. Thus, **"穷"** (qióng)** carries the meaning of *exhaustion* [穷极].
*Merely moderate* [苟且] and *exhaustion* [穷极] are diametrically opposed in meaning.
*Suggested Reading* states: **"且"** (qiě) is *initial*—this is incorrect.
*"Firm"* [《焉》] is pronounced *Yan* [于虔]. The *note* [注] is the same.

**[8]** *Textual Note*: If one’s body cannot even *comport itself*, then though they are not *themselves* [己], much less can they have *affection* [亲]!
Thus, they are entirely *others* [他人].

*Explication*: Narrow-mindedness and *inability to comport* [不容] mean no *affection* [亲爱]; lacking *affection*, they are entirely *others*.
With *hostility* [逆忤] so frequent, *enemies* [雠敌] are not few. Seeking *safety* [安泰], how can it be attained?

**[9]** *Textual Note*: The *mind’s* [志] attachments are like *congealed ice* [凝冰], thus their harm as *war* [镆(金耶)] surpasses even *swords and spears* [剑戟].
*Explication*: *Weapons* [兵戈] are mere instruments of sharpness. *镆(金耶)* (yú/jīn-yē) is a *fine sword* [良剑].
Yet, *bitterness* [憯毒] and *injury* [伤害] are nothing compared to the *mind*—
when the *mind’s* [心] attachments arise, they are swift yet not hasty, thus their *harm* [损害] surpasses even *镆(金耶)*.
By this measure, *swords and spears* [剑戟] are inferior.

*Suggested Reading*: **"憯"** (cǎn) is pronounced *Qi Kan* [七坎]. *Guang Ya* [《广雅》] states: *pain* [痛].
The *Yuanjia* [《元嘉》] version reads *Qian* [潜].
◎ *Qing Fan* [庆藩] concludes: **"憯"** (cǎn) and *cruelty* [惨] are the same.
*The Sayings of the Classics*: *cruelty* [惨] means *poison* [毒]. The character may also be written as **"憯"** (cǎn).
*Regional Speech*: *cruelty* [惨] means *to kill* [杀], aligning closely with the meaning of *poison*.
**"镆"** (yú) is pronounced *Mo* [莫].
**(金耶)** is pronounced *Ya Jie* [也嗟]. *镆(金耶)* is the name of a *fine sword* [良剑].

**[10]** *Explication*: *Raid* [寇] means *enemy* [敌]. The *mind’s* [域心] gains and losses, its *joy* and *anger* waging *war* within the chest—this is the *enemy* of *Heaven and Earth* [阴阳].
Even *mighty foes* [勍敌] and *great raiders* [巨寇] may be escaped, yet when *war* [兵] arises from within the *mind*, how can one evade *evil* [邪]!

**[11]** *Textual Note*: When the *mind* [心] governs *qi* [气], *Heaven and Earth* [阴阳] are *constrained* [征结] in the *Five Organs* [五藏], and wherever *qi* resides, it is all *Heaven and Earth*—thus, it cannot be escaped.
*Explication*: This *harm* [贼害] does not stem from *Heaven and Earth* [阴阳] themselves, but arises from the *mind’s* [心] *restlessness* [躁竞] and *competition* [竞], causing such effects.

*Suggested Reading*: **"五藏"** (wǔzàng) is pronounced *Cai Lang* [才浪]. The following all follow this pronunciation.

---
*(Note: □ represents a missing character, which in context appears to be 躁 [zào]—"restless" or "agitated".)*

**[Corrected Text]**

**[Collation Note]** (1) The characters *凝冰* follow the Song edition and the subsequent *Explication*.

The **Dao/Way** is complete—its division is but its **partition** (1).
Its **formation** and its **ruination** (1) are one.
What one **abhors** in its **partition**, is its **partition** to be **complete** (2);
What one **abhors** in **completeness**, is that it **has** what makes it **complete** (3).
Thus, to **exit** without **returning**, one **beholds its specter** (4);
To **exit** and **obtain**, this is called **"obtaining death"** (5).
To **extinguish** yet **retain substance**, this is the **one** of **ghosts** (6).
With **form** to **embody** the **formless**, it is **settled** (7).

---
**(1) [Note]** Formation and ruination are **unconstant** in their **partition**, yet the **Dao/Way** flows through all.
**[Explication]** Things receiving *qi*, each have their **limits**—beauty and ugliness, goodness and evil, **partitioned** into formation and ruination.
Yet what one calls **formation**, another calls **ruination**; the **Dao/Way** unifies them, **complete** in all.

---
**(2) [Note]** To **not uphold** one’s **partition** yet **seek completeness**, this is why one **abhors partition**.
**[Explication]** Honor and disgrace, life and death—**naturally** bestowed by **Heaven**—within one’s **inherent partition**, **sufficiency** lies in **self-return**.
To **transgress** one’s **partition** and **seek sufficiency** elsewhere is to **wander** in the realm of **right and wrong**, **abhorring** the **partition** one has received.

---
**(3) [Note]** If one’s **inherent partition** is **already complete**, why would one **abhor completeness**?
**[Explication]** If **Nature** has already **endowed sufficiency**, yet one **complains** of it—how could one know that **sufficiency** was **already complete** from the start?

---
**(4) [Note]** To **not return** and **guard** within one’s **partition**, then death comes soon.
**[Explication]** To **exit** in **folly**, **chasing** the realm of **right and wrong**, unable to **return** to one’s **origin**—this is to **court death**, hence one **beholds the specter**.

---
**(5) [Note]** To **not exit** is to **not obtain**; this is to **obtain life**.
**[Explication]** When the **mind** **chases** after **things**, **indulging desires**, and **gains** from it—this is called **"obtaining death’s root."**

---
**(6) [Note]** One has **extinguished** one’s **nature**; though **substance** remains, what **differs** from **ghosts**?
**[Explication]** To **obliterate** one’s **true nature**, to **claim** that **life and death** are **indistinguishable**—thus, one is **one** with **ghosts**.

---
**(7) [Note]** Though **substance** exists, if one is **vast** and **without attachment**, then **life is preserved** and **form is settled**.
**[Explication]** *Xiàng* means **"to resemble."**
Though **form** appears, it **resembles** the **formless**—for **form** is **not truly present**.
In **vastness**, **forgetting self**, the **mind** becomes **serene and luminous**, **still and settled**.

---
**[Collation Note]** (1) The Gao Shan Temple edition includes the characters *成也毁也* after *其分也*.

**Exit** without **origin** (1),
**Enter** without **orifice** (2).
To **have substance** yet **no place** to reside,
To **have length** yet **no root** to **plunder** (3),
To **have emergence** yet **no orifice**—this is **substance** (4).
To **have substance** yet **no place** to reside is **Space** (5).
To **have length** yet **no root** to **plunder** is **Time** (6).
There is **birth**, there is **death**, there is **emergence**, there is **entry**—
**Entry and exit** (1) yet **no sight of form** (7),
This is called the **Heavenly Gate** (8).
The **Heavenly Gate** is **non-being**—
All things **emerge from non-being** (9).
What **cannot** be **held as being** by **being**,
Must **exit from non-being** (10),
Yet **non-being** is **neither being nor non-being** (11).
The **Sage** **conceals** within this (12).

---
**(1) [Note]** **Sudden** and **self-arising**, yet **no origin**.
**(2) [Note]** **Sudden** and **self-perishing**, yet **no root**.
**[Explication]** *Exit* is **birth**; *entry* is **death**.
From **non-being** arises **being**—**being** has **no root or source**.
From **being** returns to **non-being**—**non-being** is **without orifice or cavity**.

---
**[Explication]** *Plunder* means **end** or also **origin**.
*Root* is also written as *piāo* (摽); here, it follows the character’s reading.
It speaks of **emerging from non-being** into **being**—though **substance** exists,
**Tracing** its **cause**, there is **no place** to **reside**;
From **ancient times to now**, it is **vastly long**—
**Searching** from **past to present**, yet **no beginning or end** can be found.

---
**[Release Text Notes]**
*出无本入无窍* (chū wú běn rù wú qiào): *Chū* (exit/generate) is **birth**; *rù* (enter) is **death**; *běn* is **origin**; *qiào* is **orifice**.
Thus, it is known that **form** is **burdened by the formless**—
Because **emergence and entry** have **no origin or orifice**.

**◎ Family Tradition (Father’s Commentary):**
Guo Xiang took *exit* and *entry* as **life and death**.
But *exit* and *entry* are **not** life and death—
They are **analogous** to life and death.
**Form** is **substance**; if **form** has **no place** to reside, then there is **emergence**.
The **formless** is what **sustains**—yet it has **no beginning, end, root, or extremity**—thus, there is **entry**.
**Emergence and entry** have **no orifice**, yet **substance** is **fixed**.
**Heaven and Earth**, the six directions—this is **Space**, spoken of in terms of **vastness**.
**Ancient times to the present**—this is **Time**, spoken of in terms of **duration**.
To **enter and exit** within **Space and Time** yet **see no form**—
This is called **settlement**.
*"Oùrán"* (欻然) is read as *wù* (勿).

**Exegesis and Commentary:**

**【Textual Notes】**
*"Húchǔ"*—read as *Chāngjù* (昌据反).
*Below* follows the same reading.
*"Yǒu zhǎng"*—read as *Dīngzhàng* (丁丈反), meaning "increase."
*Also* as the character itself.
*Below* follows the same reading.
*"Běn piāo"*—*běn* also written as *piāo* (摽), same.
*Fǔ* (甫) read as *xiǎo* (小反).
*Cui* says: "end."
*Lì* read as *bùyáo* (怖遥反), *Xú* again as *fúyáo* (敷遥反).
*Below* follows the same.
◎ *Lú Wénpiàn* says: *"Piāo"* should be *"biāo"* (标).

**【Commentary】**
It speaks of the *emergence* having its own *substance*—yet its *emergence* lacks an orifice or root from which it issues.

**【Exegesis】**
Though it *emerges*, there is no orifice—
For the common observer, it seems to have *substance*, yet truly it does not.
If there were an orifice, it would require *substance*;
But *substance* is unattainable, so the orifice is nonexistent.

**【Textual Notes】**
*"Yǒu suǒ chū"*—"All that emerges must have a source."
*"Ér wú"*—This clarifies that the source is *nonexistent*.
If it is *nonexistent*, how could there be emergence?

*"Kǒu zhě yǒu shí"*—If there is an orifice, it must have *substance*;
Seeking *substance* yields nothing, so the orifice is also nonexistent.

**【Commentary】**
*Space* (*yǔ*) has four directions—up, down, and the four cardinal points—yet these directions are without limit.

**【Exegesis】**
*Space* refers to the four directions and above/below.
Though things arise, they seem to have *substance*, yet searching *Space* reveals no origin.
If *Space* is nonexistent, how could there be a place?

**【Textual Notes】**
*"Yǒu shí ér wú húchǔ zhě yǔ yě"*—The *Three Ancient Readings* (*Sānpáng*) say: "The four directions and above/below constitute *Space*."
Though *Space* may seem to have *substance*, no fixed place can be found.

**【Commentary】**
*Time* (*zhòu*) has the length of ancient and modern eras, yet this length is boundless.

**【Exegesis】**
*Time* refers to past antiquity and the present.
The seasons stretch long, called *ancient and modern*;
Examining successive ages reveals no beginning or end.
If *Time* is nonexistent, how could there be an origin?

**【Textual Notes】**
*"Yǒu zhǎng ér wú běn piāo zhě zhòu yě"*—The *Three Ancient Readings* say: "Past antiquity to the present is *Time*."
The *Shuōwén Jiězì* says: "The covering of a boat or carriage is called *Time*."
*Zhǎng* means "increase."
*Běn* means "beginning."
Though *Time* may increase, its beginning and end remain unknown.

**【Commentary】**
Death, life, emergence, and entry—
All occur *wùrán* (欻然), spontaneously, without cause, thus no form is seen.

**【Exegesis】**
*Emergence* and *entry* are like *life* and *death*.
Though they bear these names, probing their nature reveals no visible form of their emergence or entry.

**【Commentary】**
*The Heavenly Gate* is the collective name for all things.
It is called *Heavenly Gate*, akin to the *Gate of All Marvels*.

**【Exegesis】**
*Heaven* refers to the natural order—
The natural order is defined by having no origin.
All existence arises from nowhere, its source unfathomable;
Thus, *Heaven* is the gateway of creation.

**【Commentary】**
Death, life, emergence, and entry—
All occur *wùrán*, spontaneously, with no agent behind them.
Yet there is gathering and dispersal, concealment and revelation—
Thus they bear the names *emergence* and *entry*.
Only in name do they exist; truly, there is no emergence or entry.
Where then is the *Gate*?
Thus, the *Gate* is *nonbeing*.

If the *Gate* is *nonbeing*, then there is no *Gate*.

**【Exegesis】**
The natural order’s principle, the gateway of transformation—
Only in name does it exist; in reality, it is nonexistent.
Yet all things arise from this *Gate*, hence Guo’s note: "The *Gate* is *nonbeing*."
If the *Gate* is *nonbeing*, then there is no *Gate*.

**【Commentary】**
Before *being* emerged, what gave rise to it?
Thus, it must arise from *itself*—how could *being* itself be its cause?

**【Exegesis】**
If *being* exists, how could it give rise to *being*?
Before *being* emerged, who gave rise to it?
Seeking this *being* reveals nothingness.

**【Commentary】**
This clarifies that *being* cannot create *being*—it arises from *itself*.
If *nonbeing* could create *being*, what would *nonbeing* be?

**【Exegesis】**
Both *being* and *nonbeing* are nonexistent;
This *being* emerges from *nonbeing*—not that *nonbeing* can generate *being*.
If *nonbeing* could generate *being*, what would *nonbeing* be?

**【Commentary】**
If *nonbeing* is absolute, then *being* is nonexistent.
If *nonbeing* is nonexistent, then *being* spontaneously emerges.

**【Exegesis】**
Not examining the four negations—
All is *nonbeing*, hence "one *nonbeing*."
*(Note: Original text appears truncated; "四句" likely refers to the four negations in Buddhist logic—*abhāva*, *śūnyatā*, etc.)*

**【Commentary】**
The Sage of ancient times, attuned to the Dao, harmonized with reality—
Concealing the spirit, hiding wisdom—
This is their state.

**Textual Corrections:**
(1) Omitted text from *Zhāng Jūnfáng*’s edition: *"Chū rù"* (出入) corrected to *"chūrù"* (出入).
(2) *"Jìng"* (竟) corrected based on the following sentence.

---
**Ancient Masters’ Insight Reached Its Peak.**
How did they attain it?
Some say: *"Before anything existed, they reached the peak, exhausted it—nothing more could be added."*
The next level: *"Things exist,"*
Yet they see *birth* as *loss*,
And *death* as *return*—
Thus, they are divided.

The next says: *"At first, there was *nonbeing*;*
Then *being* arose, *being* swiftly perished.
Taking *nonbeing* as the head,
*Being* as the body,
*Death* as the tail—
Who knows the unity of *being* and *nonbeing*, *life* and *death*?
I would count them as my friends.

---
**These three, though differing, are kin—**
Like *Zhāo* and *Jìng* (昭景),
Like *Zhuó* and *Dài* (着戴),
Like *Jiǎ* and *Fēng* (甲氏, 着封)—
They are not one.

**【Exegesis】**
The ancient Sage, attuned to the Dao, merged with reality—
Thus called *"attained."*

**【Exegesis】**
Asking how they attained it—
*(Original text truncated; likely refers to the method of their attainment.)*

**【Exegesis of Terms】**
*"Éhū"* is pronounced *Wū*.

**【Exegesis】**
This reveals the true nature of the *attained*—
Once knowledge reaches its peak, all within is void,
Thus all phenomena are used without attachment—
Not a single thing remains.
This is the utmost subtlety, exhausting principle and perfecting nature,
A boundless, wondrous emptiness beyond further refinement.

**【Exegesis】**
In the next stage, they have not yet grasped true emptiness,
Yet perceive all myriad things as substantial.

**【Annotation】**
*"Sāng"* means to lose and turn toward aggregation.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*"Wéisāng"* is pronounced *xīlàng*.

**Annotation:** Same as above.

**【Annotation】**
*"Róngyè"* means to return and dissolve.

**【Exegesis】**
*Sāng* means *loss*.
Common folk regard *life* as gain and *death* as loss.
Now, to reverse their deluded perception,
*Life* is called *loss*—for it is *nonbeing*;
*Death* is called *return*—returning to emptiness and stillness.
Though not yet attaining the utmost subtlety,
They equalize *life* and *death*.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*"Róngyè"* is pronounced *yì*.

**【Annotation】**
Though they seek equality, distinction remains.

**【Exegesis】**
Though *life* and *death* are equalized,
They still perceive their difference,
Thus arising from *nonbeing* to make distinctions.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*"Yǐ fēn"* is pronounced *fāngyún*.

**【Exegesis】**
In the next stage, their understanding dims slightly—
At first, there was *nonbeing*;
Then *being* arose, swiftly perishing.
Thus, they take *nonbeing* as the head,
*Being* as the form,
*Death* as the tail.
Who knows the unity of *being* and *nonbeing*, *life* and *death*,
And cultivates it thus?
Zhuangzi would befriend such a person—
Such individuals are rare indeed.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*"Wéi shāo"* is pronounced *kǔgāo*.

**【Annotation】**
Some take *being* and *nonbeing* as one,
Some take them as singular,
Some equalize them through division—
Thus, three categories.
Though these three differ in completeness,
All refrain from judgment within,
Hence called *public kin*.

**【Exegesis】**
The three refer to:
Taking *nonbeing* as the head,
*Being* as the body,
*Death* as the tail.
Within one unity, these three distinctions arise—
Like the three clans of the Chu lineage under one surname.

**【Annotation】**
Though these four are *public kin*,
They are not one—
Thus, the previous three already differ.

**【Exegesis】**
*Zhāo* and *Jǐng* are the three public clans of Chu.
Long ago, Qu Yuan was the Grand Tutor of the Three Gates,
Overseeing the three clans and three surnames—
This is the case.
The text is abbreviated, thus simply stating *Zhāo* and *Jǐng*.
Royal princes, upon coming of age, wore robes and crowns—
Each held ranks, fulfilling their duties,
And received surnames through their offices,
Thus *Jiǎ* (甲) as a clan—
Their merits recorded, they were granted fiefs,
Branches spreading—
Hence, they are not one.

Like the Dao itself,
Divided into *being* and *nonbeing*, *life* and *death*,
Each with distinct names and realities—
Thus, their clans are cited as analogy.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*"Zhāojǐng yě zhuó"* is pronounced *dīnglüè* or *zhānglǜ*.
*"Dài"* is also written as *zǎi*.
*"Yě jiǎ shì yě zhuó"* is pronounced *zhānglǜ* (long) or *dīnglüè*.
*"Fēng yě fēi yī yě"*—
One interpretation says:
*Zhāo*, *Jǐng*, and *Jiǎ* are all of Chu’s same lineage.
*Zhuó* and *Dài* refer to wearing crowns,
Generations serving in Chu’s court, revered by all.
*Zhuó* and *Fēng* refer to holding fiefs,
Their glory enduring.
Though *Zhāo*, *Jǐng*, and *Jiǎ* are three surnames,
Their origins are the same.
Cui (崔) says:
*Zhāo* and *Jǐng* are two surnames honored by Chu,
All of the *Jiǎ* lineage, granted illustrious fiefs—
Though not one surname, they share the same public kin,
Illustrating the unity of *life* and *death*.
These two interpretations differ from the annotation.

◎ *Jiāshì Fù* says:
Gu’s annotation calls the four *public kin*,
Seemingly treating *Zhāo*, *Jǐng*, and *Jiǎ* as clans.
The *Exegesis of Terms* says:
*Zhāo*, *Jǐng*, and *Jiǎ* are all of Chu’s same lineage.
It also cites Cui, saying:
*Zhāo* and *Jǐng* are two surnames honored by Chu,
All of the *Jiǎ* lineage, granted illustrious fiefs.
Doubtless, Cui’s interpretation is correct.
Wang Yi’s *Annotations on Chu Ci* states:
The Three Gates oversaw the royal clans’ three surnames:
*Zhāo*, *Qu*, and *Jǐng*.
There is no *Jiǎ* as a surname.
*The Book of Characters* says:
*Shǒu* (首) means *to wear*.
*The Yà* says:
*Dài* (戴) refers to the road’s beginning, facing the mound.
*Zhuó* and *Dài* refer to *Zhāo* and *Jǐng* succeeding as surnames;
*Jiǎ* is the beginning of the day—
Speaking of first receiving a surname to be granted a fief,
Then succeeding as a surname.
Though of the same public kin,
Their origins are not one.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*"Yǐ fù"* is pronounced *fúyòu*.

**Collation:**
(1) The text is missing; as in the *Hǎi* edition, *zhōu* (守) is mistakenly cited as *zōng* (宗).
*"Yǒu shēng"* (有生) is pronounced *hēixiàn*.
*Bìrán* (披然) is pronounced *yíshì*.
It was said: *"Yíshì"*—this is not what was spoken.
(3) Nevertheless, it is unknowable.
The *là* (腊) of *làzhě* has *fēngtí* (膍胲)—
It can be dispersed, yet cannot be dispersed.
(5) Observing a hall, they circle the ancestral temple,
Then suddenly stop—
This is called *"Yíshì."*

**【Annotation】**
This is merely the gathering of *qi*.

**【Exegesis】**
*Hēixiàn* means *blemish*.
To call this formless *being* merely a gathering of *qi* into a blemish—
This is not what is honored.
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*"Yǒu shēng (hēixiàn)"* is pronounced *xúyújiǎn*.
Sima (司马) says: *Hēi* (黡) means *blemished*,
Blemished—desiring to peel away.
Li (李) is pronounced *wūgǎn*.
*Zìlín* says: *Hēi* is the black at the pot’s bottom.

「(2) **【Annotation】**
Once the *qi* has dispersed (*bìrán*), yet distinctions arise,
Then each becomes what it is called (二).
This is impermanent, hence it is said to be *"moved"* (*yí*).

**【Exegesis】**
*Bì* (披) means *dispersed*.
The Dao does not disperse me, yet things have their distinctions (*shìfēi* 是非),
These distinctions are not fixed, hence they disperse and move (*yíxǐ* 移徙) without permanence.
The state of their movement (*yí*) is detailed below.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Bì* (披) is pronounced *pǔpí*.
*"Yíshì"* (移是)—some say: □*Rán* (然) gathered while alive, *bìrán* (披然) dispersed while dead.

(3) **【Annotation】**
The movement (*yí*) of what is called (*suǒshì* 所是) has already been spoken of.

**【Exegesis】**
It tests the distinctions of form and substance (*lǐxíng shìfēi* 理形是非),
Hence the words are merely spoken.
Yet the movement of distinctions (*shìfēi* 是非) is not what is spoken of.

(4) **【Annotation】**
If one does not speak of its movement (*yí*),
Then its movement cannot be known—
Hence one tests it through speech.

**【Exegesis】**
Though distinctions (*shìfēi* 是非) do not depend on speech,
Without speech, one cannot know distinctions.
Hence one speaks of distinctions (*shìfēi* 是非) to dispel them.
Names do not rely on speech—
Only then does one know that distinctions are without distinctions (*shìfēi wú shìfēi* 是非無是非).

(5) **【Annotation】**
Things each have their use (*yòng* 用).

**【Exegesis】**
*Là* (腊) refers to the grand sacrifice.
*Fēngtí* (膍胲): *Fēng* (膍) is the cow’s hundred leaves (i.e., its hide),
*Tí* (胲) means *complete*—also referring to its hooves.
At the time of the grand sacrifice (*là*),
The sacrificial animals are fully prepared—
Even their limbs and five viscera are displayed.
Once the sacrificial rites are concluded,
They are then dispersed—
This is called *proper* (*shì* 是).
If the sacrifice is not yet finished,
They should not be dispersed—
This is called *improper* (*bùshì* 不是).
Thus one knows that *proper* and *improper* are without permanence (*yíshì wúcháng* 移是無常).

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Là* (腊) is pronounced *lìhé*.
*"Zhě zhī yǒu fēngtí"* (者之有膍胲) is pronounced *pī* (毗).」

「Sīmǎ yún: The cow’s hundred leaves (*fēng* 膍) are indeed its hide.
Originally, *fēng* (膍) was sometimes written as □, pronounced *pī* (毗), meaning *roe deer*.
*Tí* (胲), pronounced *gǔlái* (古来反), refers to the great toe.
Cuī yún: *Tí* (胲) means *complete*.
In the grand sacrifice (*là* 腊), all sacrificial animals are fully prepared, and the feast includes *fēngtí* (膍胲). Though these may be dispersed, the ritual demands that nothing essential should be discarded—this is the proper order.

**【Sixth Annotation】**
*Yǎn* (偃) refers to the screened privy (*píngzhè* 屏厕).

**【Exegesis】**
*Yǎn* (偃) is the screened privy (*píngzhè* 屏厕).
When the sacrificial rites are complete, the *zhāi gōng* (斋宫) and the feasting are done,
And the remaining sacrificial meat (*yúzhì* 胙) is placed within the halls and chambers.
The participants observe and move about within the *qǐn miào* (寝庙).
After prolonged feasting, they must retire to a private place,
Thus they go to the screened privy (*yǎn* 偃) to relieve themselves.
Feasting is deemed proper within the *qǐn miào* (寝庙),
While relieving oneself is deemed proper within the screened privy (*yǎn* 偃).
Thus *proper* and *improper* are without constancy—
How can anything be definitively fixed?

The grand sacrifice (*là* 腊) illustrates that gathering and dispersing are without permanence,
And that the designated chambers and places are not fixed—
All are without *proper* or *improper*.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Yǎn* (其偃) is pronounced *yúwǎn* (于晚反).
Both Sīmǎ (司马) and Guō (郭) state: It is the screened privy (*píngzhè* 屏厕).
It is also pronounced *yújàn* (于建反).
◎ Qìngfān (庆藩) notes: Guō (郭) and Sīmǎ (司马) both say *yǎn* (偃) is the screened privy (*píngzhè* 屏厕).
Guìfú (桂馥) states: *Píng* (屏) should be *yǎn* (庰), and *yǎn* (偃) should be *yàn* (晏).
In *Jíjiù Piān* (急就篇), *yǎn* (庰) is described as a name for a private, screened place (*bìyǎn* 僻偃).
Now, I consider *yǎn* (偃) should be *yīn* (匽).
The *Zhōu Lǐ* (周礼) mentions that attendants (*gōngrén* 宫人) serve at the privy (*yīn* 匽), which I suspect may be a miswritten character for *yǎn* (庰).
*Zhōu Lǐ* (周礼) further states: *Yīn* (匽) is a roadside privy (*lùyǎn* 路厕).
The *Yàn Cè* (燕策) records that the *Sòngwáng Zhòu* (宋王铸) sent attendants to serve at the *píng* (屏), which is also a miswritten character for *yǎn* (庰).
Thus, *yǎn yīn* (庰匽) refers to the screened privy (*yǎn* 庰).
The *Kāiyuán Zhànjīng* (开元占经) quotes Gān Shì (甘氏) as saying:
The seven stars of *Tiān yǎn* (天溷) are outside the *píng* (屏).
The *Huáinán Zhù* (淮南注) states: *Tiān yǎn* (天溷) is the privy (*yǎn* 厕),
And *píng* (屏) is what shields the sky’s shadow (*yǐn* 翳).
*Píngyǎn* (屏厕) is pronounced *bùdìng* (步定反) or *bìlǐng* (必领反).
The same applies below.

**【Seventh Annotation】**
The *qǐn miào* (寝庙) is where the feast and reception (*xiǎngyàn* 飨燕) take place,
While the screened privy (*yǎn* 偃) is where one relieves oneself (*sǎoshuō* 溲).
When one relieves oneself in the screened privy (*yǎn* 偃),
The *proper* (*shì* 是) of the *qǐn miào* (寝庙) shifts to the screened privy (*yǎn* 偃).
Thus, the shifting of *proper* and *improper* alternates between one and the other—
Who could maintain constancy in this?

Hence, the *Perfect Sage* (*Zhìrén* 至人) follows this principle and rides upon it,
And thereby achieves balance (*jūn* 均).

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Wéi shì* (为是) is pronounced *yúwěi* (于伪反).
◎ Jiāshìfù (家世父) says:
*Yǒushēng* (有生) is *chén* (尘, dust).
□ (*yǒu* 有, here referring to *yǎn* 偃) is the accumulation and retention of dust (*chén* 尘).
Thus, it is said that one exchanges life (*shēng* 生) for death (*sǐ* 死),
And the transformation is called *shifting proper* (*yǐshì* 移是).

Although there is life (*shēng* 生),
Like *fēngtí* (膍胲) clinging to one another,
Dispersal leads to death (*sǐ* 死),
Yet it cannot be permanently dispersed.
Those with life must also face death,
Just as the *qǐn miào* (寝庙) requires the *yǎn* (偃, privy act).
These are interdependent and thus arise together.

The phrase *shifting proper* (*yǐshì* 移是) signifies
That life is seen as a burden (*lèi* 累),
Death as return (*guī* 归),
And self-perception as a hindrance (*lèi* 累).
To equalize life and death (*qíngshēngsǐ* 齐生死),
One transcends the labels of *proper* and *improper*, name and reality (*shìngmíngshí* 是非名实).
If one regards life as a burden,
Then one must inevitably hold onto a fixed perception (*jǐ* 己),
And thereby create distinctions of *proper* and *improper*, name and reality (*shìngmíngshí* 是非名实),
Which give rise to the contentions of foolishness, pride, and shame (*yúróngrù* 愚荣辱).

The shifting of *proper* (*yǐshì* 移是) has its limits—
There are things that cannot be shifted.
This is the reason life (*shēng* 生) is called □ (*yǎn* 偃).

*Sǎoshuō* (溲) is pronounced *suǒliú* (所留反).

**Corrections:**
(1) The text from *Jiāngnán Gǔzàng* (江南古藏本) and *Lǐzhāng* (李张二本) omits the character *shuō* (溲) after *yǎn* (偃).
(2) The *Shìdétáng* (世德堂本) has *yě* (也) instead of *yǐ* (矣).
Please use the term *shifting proper* (*yǐshì* 移是) consistently in speech.»

Thus, life (*shēng* 生) is taken as the root **[1]**, and knowledge (*zhī* 知) as the teacher **[2]**, yet one rides upon distinctions of *proper* and *improper* **[3]**. Names and realities (*míngshí* 名实) are indeed produced **[4]**, and one thereby takes oneself as the standard **[5]**. This makes others regard it as one’s principle (*jié* 节), and one thereby repays with death for one’s principle **[7]**.

If such is the case, then to act is seen as wisdom, inaction as foolishness, clarity as honorable name (*míng* 名), and adversity as shame (*rǔ* 辱) **[8]**. Those who engage in *shifting proper* (*yǐshì* 移是) are the people of today **[9]**, just as the cicada and the *xuān* bird (*xiāo jiū* 蜩鸠) share the same delusion **[10]**.

---
**[1] Annotation:** The transformations of things—there is no moment without life (*shēng*), and wherever life is, that is the root (*běn* 本).
**Exegesis:** Those who can forget life and death have no *proper* or *improper*. It is only because they are entangled in life that they cling to *proper* distinctions. If one must abandon life, where else would one rest? Thus, it is said that *shifting proper* takes life as the root.

**[2] Annotation:** Though the known may differ, each takes their own knowledge as teacher.

**[3] Annotation:** To ride upon distinctions of *proper* and *improper* is to have no *proper* or *improper* at all.
**Exegesis:** Because of the heart’s attachment to its teacher’s knowledge, the heart rides upon the function of *proper* and *improper*—how could one who takes their teacher’s knowledge as inverted *proper* and *improper* truly have no *proper* or *improper*?

**[4] Annotation:** The names and realities of things indeed each have their own.
**Exegesis:** All things, spoken of thus, are but empty illusions—straw dogs and myriad phenomena. Where do names and realities apply? Those who invert [truth] assert that these names and realities are definitively real.

**[5] Annotation:** *Quality* (*zhì* 质) means *master* (*zhǔ* 主). Each thing claims itself as *proper*, sufficient to be the master of *proper* and *improper*.
**Exegesis:** *Quality* means *master*. Blindly grasping names and realities, one thereby takes oneself as the master of names and realities, contending over *proper* and *improper*.

**[6] Annotation:** All claim themselves as *proper*, so none understand.
**Exegesis:** *Principle* (*jié* 节) is ultimate integrity (*zhì* 操). Having lost sight of names and realities and become entangled in *proper* and *improper*, one makes the unenlightened firmly cling to empty names as their integrity.

**[7] Annotation:** What one upholds is not true liberation.
**Exegesis:** Upholding *proper* and *improper* to form resolve—unyielding and steadfast—one dies clinging to it.
**Phonetic Explanation:** *"Repay with death for one’s principle"* (*yǐ sǐ cháng jié* 以死偿节) is pronounced with *cháng* as in *liàng* (亮). The *Guangya* states: *cháng* means "to repay," "to reciprocate." It is said that one kills oneself to establish a name, and when the principle is fulfilled, the body dies—thus, "to repay with death for one’s principle."

**[8] Annotation:** Unable to adapt to circumstances as they arise.
**Exegesis:** To flaunt as wisdom, to conceal as foolishness, to clarity as honorable name, and to adversity as shame—if such is the case, how could one harmonize with adversity, prosperity, honor, or shame?

**[9] Annotation:** The ancient and pure had no *proper* or *improper*—what shifting could there be?
**Exegesis:** Those who rigidly cling to names and realities, who are entangled in *proper* and *improper*, who are superficial and deceitful—these are the people of today. How could they be the pure and unadorned scholars of antiquity?

**[10] Annotation:** *Shared* (*tóng* 同) is what they share.
**Exegesis:** The cicada and the *xuān* bird (*xiāo jiū* 蜩鸠) take reeds and weeds as *proper*. Though these two creatures share the same *proper*, it is not true enlightenment. Those who engage in *shifting proper* are of this kind. The cicada is like the *xuān* bird, and the *xuān* bird is like the cicada—thus, "shared in the same delusion."
**Phonetic Explanation:** *"Cicada"* (*xiāo* 蜩) is pronounced *tiáo* (条). *"Xuān bird"* (*jiū* 鸠) is sometimes written as *xuān* (*jiū* 鸴), with the same pronunciation.

---
**Collation Notes:**
(1) The *Jiāngnán Gǔzàng* (江南古藏本) and *Lǐzhāng* (李张二本) manuscripts omit the character *fēi* (非) after *jīn* (今) above.
(2) The *Zhào Jiànyì* (赵谏议本) has *shì* (是) instead of *zú* (足).

When one treads upon a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one excuses oneself by claiming arrogance (*fàngmiǎo* 放骜) **[1]**, upon a brother’s by feigning maternal tenderness (*yūxǔ* 妪诩) **[2]**, and upon a parent’s, one remains silent **[3]**. Thus it is said: the utmost *ritual* (*lǐ* 礼) does not apply to others **[4]**, the utmost *rightness* (*yì* 义) does not apply to things **[5]**, the utmost *wisdom* (*zhī* 知) does not deliberate **[6]**, the utmost *benevolence* (*rén* 仁) has no kin **[7]**, and the utmost *trustworthiness* (*xìn* 信) rejects gold **[8]**.

**[1] Annotation:** One falsely claims detachment to apologize.
**Exegesis:** *Tread* (*diàn* 蹍) means to step or trample. Trampling upon the foot of a stranger in the marketplace—one excuses oneself, saying, "I was arrogant and reckless in my mistake," not doing it intentionally.

**[2] Annotation:** One feigns maternal tenderness without apology.
**Exegesis:** Trampling upon a brother’s foot, one acts with maternal tenderness and pity, not shamed by words.

**[3] Annotation:** One acknowledges natural humility.
**Exegesis:** If a father tramples upon a child’s foot, one remains silent without further excuse. Thus, it is known that words of apology are hollow and insincere.

**[4] Annotation:** *Ritual* that does not apply to others is to regard others as oneself. To regard others as oneself means no apology is needed—this is the utmost *ritual*.
**Exegesis:** Both sides forgotten, one regards others as oneself. Not distinguishing between self and others, how could there be apologies? This is the utmost *ritual*.

**[5] Annotation:** Each attains its proper place, so all things are oneself.
**Exegesis:** Having transcended the duality of self and other, one perfectly attains harmony. Not knowing that there is anything outside oneself, how could there be distinctions of *proper* and *improper*?

This is the utmost *righteousness* **[1]**.

**[6] Annotation:** One knows only after deliberation—this is not innate knowledge.
**Exegesis:** To illuminate nature spontaneously is not to know through scheming. This is the utmost *wisdom*.

**[7] Annotation:** By analogy with the five *zàng* organs—though they have never met, *ren* (benevolence) has already reached its fullness.
**Exegesis:** Like hands and feet, they naturally assist one another without conscious effort, yet their harmonizing function is complete. How could there be affection between them?

**[8] Annotation:** Gold and jade are merely the substance of petty *faith*—true *faith* transcends them.
**Exegesis:** *Bì* means "to discard." Gold and jade are but the substance of petty *faith*; true *faith* casts them aside.

---
To pierce through *zhi* (arrogance), to dissolve *miù* (delusion of the heart), to remove the burdens of *virtue*, to unblock the obstructions of the *Dao* **[1]**.

Wealth, honor, eminence, prestige, reputation, and profit—these agitate the *zhi* **[2]**.
Appearance, movement, expression, speech, *qi*, and intention—these ensnare the mind **[3]**.
Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—these encumber *virtue* **[4]**.
Departure, approach, taking, giving, knowing, and ability—these obstruct the *Dao* **[5]**.
If these twelve categories do not disturb the chest, one attains rectitude; rectitude brings stillness; stillness brings clarity; clarity brings emptiness; emptiness allows *wuwei* yet accomplishes all **[6]**.

The *Dao* is the revered manifestation of *virtue* **[7]**.
Life is the radiance of *virtue* **[8]**.
Nature is the essence of life **[9]**.
When nature moves, it is called *wei* **[10]**.
When *wei* is artificial, it is called *loss* **[11]**.
Knowledge is *jie* (reception);
Knowledge is *mó* (deliberation) **[12]**.
What the knowing does not know is like *nì* (glancing) **[13]**.
To move only when unavoidable is *virtue* **[14]**.
To move without ever opposing oneself is *zhì* (governance) **[15]**.
Names may be contrary, yet their reality aligns **[16]**.

**[1] Exegesis:** *Chè* means "to destroy." *Bó* means "to disrupt." *Miù* means "to bind." This section briefly names the categories; their detailed explanations follow below.
**Annotations:** *Zhī-bó* originally also written as *bèi*, same meaning. *Zhī-miù* as written. One version reads *miù*, pronounced *wúng-hóu* (same as *miù*).
*Zhī-dé* pronounced *qǐ-lù*.

**[2] Exegesis:** Honor, wealth, abundance, elevation, dignity, fame, and gain—these six are the instruments that disrupt emotions and will.

**[3] Exegesis:** Mien, movement, complexion, discourse, *qi*, and sentiment—these six bind and ensnare the spirit. Some texts also use *miù* (delusion), clarifying the heart’s falsehoods.

**[4] Exegesis:** Hatred, love, joy, anger, grief, and pleasure—these six are the afflictions burdening *virtue*.
**Annotations:** *È-yù* pronounced *wū-lù*. *Āi-lè* pronounced *luò*. *Lèi-dé* pronounced *liè-wěi*. Later annotations match this.

**[5] Exegesis:** Departure and dwelling, acquisition and bestowal, cognition and deliberation, skill and ability—these six obstruct the True Dao.

**[6] Annotation:** *Dàng* means "movement."
**Exegesis:** The afflictions of the fourth and sixth [sections]—if they do not agitate within the chest, then the mind and spirit remain balanced. Balance brings tranquility, tranquility brings clarity, clarity brings openness, openness brings serenity and non-action. Responding to things without exhaustion.

**[7] Exegesis:** Dao is the method of cultivation; virtue is the conduct toward others. To revere people over method, hence one honors the Dao.
**Annotation:** *Yú Yù* says: In *Shuō Wén* (Explanations of Script): *chǎn* (陳) means to array offerings and garments in the courtyard. In *Xiǎo Éryá* (Minor Commentary on Words): *chǎn* means "to array." Here, *qīn* (欽) is a borrowed character for *chǎn*. What sustains life is virtue, and when arrayed, it becomes Dao—thus, it is called the *chǎn* of virtue. The *Hàn Shū* (Book of Han) annotation on Emperor Aidi cites *Lǐ Fěi* as saying: "Arrayed" means Dao. This is its meaning.

**[8] Exegesis:** The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *shēng* (生, "generation"), thus the generation and transformation of all things is the radiant manifestation of supreme virtue.
**Annotation:** *Dé zhī guāng* (德之光) – One version reads *xiān* (先) instead of *guāng*.

**[9] Exegesis:** *Zhì* (質) means "root." Natural disposition is the root of what is received at birth.

**[10] Annotation:** Movement arising from nature is thus called *ěr* (耳, "ear"); this is true action, not contrived action.
**Exegesis:** Moving in accordance with nature, acting within one’s proper role—acting without contrivance is true action, not contrived action.

**[11] Exegesis:** Responding to things and moving—this is the desire of nature. To distort nature and feign emotions is to act beyond one’s role; this is called losing the Dao.

**[12] Exegesis:** Engaging with things before them, deliberating and attending to affairs—this is called *zhī* (知, "knowing").

**[13] Annotation:** The eye’s ability to see is not knowing how to see while seeing; it sees without knowing it sees—this is natural. If one knows before acting, then knowing is false.
**Exegesis:** *Nì* (睨) means "to glance." The eye opens to see without knowing how it sees, yet vision has clarity and darkness. The mind knows without knowing how it knows, yet knowledge has depth and shallowness. The eye cannot force vision, nor can the mind force knowing. If there were limits, it would be like glancing. If one forces it, it is false.

**[14] Annotation:** If movement arises from compulsion, it is forced movement—this is where loss lies.
**Exegesis:** When movement comes from necessity, harmonious yet not forced, using it without constraint—this is supreme virtue.
**Annotation:** *Jiāshì Fù* says: When interacting with things, knowledge arises naturally. Deliberating accordingly, one earns a name. What one does not know is still grasped through intuition, like glancing. Knowledge arises this way, yet the Dao is corrupted by it. Moving only when unavoidable and fully trusting nature—why speak of knowing at all?

**[15] Annotation:** Moving to imitate others brings disorder.
**Exegesis:** Moving in accordance with nature, without abandoning oneself to conform to things, aligns with proper principle—thus, there is no disorder.

**[16] Annotation:** There are names of "self" and "other," hence opposition; when each attains its reality, it follows naturally.
**Exegesis:** There are names of "self," "other," "right," and "wrong," hence opposition in names. Without the reality of "self," "other," "right," or "wrong," their essences align naturally.

**Text:**
Yì was skilled in hitting minute targets but clumsy in avoiding self-praise.
The Sage was skilled in Heaven but clumsy in human affairs.
He who is skilled in Heaven and clumsy in human affairs—only the *quán rén* (全人, "complete person") can do this.
Only insects can understand insects; only insects can understand Heaven.
Does the complete person hate Heaven? Does he hate the human aspect of Heaven?
And yet, what of my Heaven and my humanity?

**[1] Annotation:** Skill in hitting brings praise naturally.
**Exegesis:** Yì was an ancient archer. *Gōng* (工) means "skillful." Yì bent his bow and shot arrows, mastering the subtleties of archery. With such skill, he earned his name, yet avoiding self-praise was impossible.

**[2] Annotation:** Following nature is Heaven; deliberate action is human.
**Exegesis:** The earlier passage used analogy; this is its application. The Sage harmonizes with nature, his achievements matching creation. He makes all things function without revealing his traces—this is truly difficult. Hence, the earlier passage says, "Making the world forget me is difficult."

**[3] Annotation:** Skill in Heaven means clumsiness in human affairs—this is the *quán rén* (complete person), the Sage.
**Exegesis:** *Lǎng* (俍) means "good." The *quán rén* is the *shén rén* (神人, "divine person").

**[4] Only insects can understand insects; only insects can understand Heaven.**
**[5] Does the complete person hate Heaven? Does he hate the human aspect of Heaven?**
**[6] And yet, what of my Heaven and my humanity?**

「》This is the sound of *yú* (余, "excess"). The later chapters are the same.

**[3] Annotation:** The Sage who skillfully harmonizes with nature is clumsy in human affairs—this is the *quán rén* (complete person), the Sage.
**Exegesis:** *Lǎng* (俍, "good/adept") means "good." The *quán rén* (complete person) is the *shén rén* (神人, "divine person").

**[4] Annotation:** To return and guard over insects is to be skilled in Heaven—this is the *quán rén*.
**Exegesis:** Birds fly, beasts run, yet they are skilled in insects; spiders weave webs, dung beetles roll balls—these are skilled in Heaven. All are endowed by the Creator, yet how could they achieve this through mere imitation?

**[5] Exegesis:** The complete person’s virtue is boundless, his divine power unfathomable. Would he scorn his own innate nature and hate what others are endowed with? No! He simply follows his natural inclination.

**[6] Annotation:** To act without knowing, yet still in accordance—this is what is meant by "skillful in Heaven."
**Exegesis:** Whether Heaven or humanity, he sees no distinction between them, acting in total alignment. The earlier passages spoke of Heaven and humanity as separate, yet here they are merged—no distinction is seen between them. *Wú* (吾, "my") is the author’s self-referential term.

A single sparrow alights where the archer stands, and the archer will surely capture it—this is *wēi* (威, "awe/force") **[1]**. But if one uses the whole world as a cage, then the sparrow has no place to flee **[2]**. Thus, King Tang of Shang enclosed Yi Yin within the kitchen **[1]**, and Duke Mu of Qin ransomed Bai Li Xi with five-colored sheep pelts **[2]**.

**[3] Exegesis:** Thus, those who cannot be captured by what they love are nonexistent **[4]**. **[1] Annotation:** Force is used to seize things, and things will surely flee it. **[2] Annotation:** All things in the world have their own inclinations; if their inclinations are satisfied, where would they flee to? **[3] Exegesis:** The Great Dao is vast and boundless, encompassing all without exception. Hence, using Heaven and Earth as a cage means the sparrow has no escape. To know that force alone can seize things is fundamentally contrary to the Creator’s intent.

**[4] Exegesis:** To follow their inclinations is to make all things in the world effortless to obtain; to constrain their nature and forcefully capture them is never possible.

**[5] Annotation:** The Sage’s Way is to act without knowing, yet still in accordance—this is what is meant by "skillful in Heaven."
**Exegesis:** Whether Heaven or humanity, he sees no distinction between them, acting in total alignment. The earlier passages spoke of Heaven and humanity as separate, yet here they are merged—no distinction is seen between them. *Wú* (吾, "my") is the author’s self-referential term.

**[6] Exegesis:** To act with awe and seize things is contrary to virtue and wisdom, so few are captured while many flee. To rule the world with awe is the same in principle.

A single sparrow alights where the archer stands, and the archer will surely capture it—this is *wēi* (威, "awe/force") **[1]**. But if one uses the whole world as a cage, then the sparrow has no place to flee **[2]**. Thus, King Tang of Shang enclosed Yi Yin within the kitchen **[1]**, and Duke Mu of Qin ransomed Bai Li Xi with five-colored sheep pelts **[2]**.

**[3] Exegesis:** Yi Yin was a lowly servant of the Shī clan, skilled in cooking, and carried a jade tripod to serve King Tang. Tang knew of his virtue and also followed his nature, so he appointed him as a kitchen official to contain him. Bai Li Xi was exiled to Di, where the people valued sheep pelts, so Duke Mu of Qin redeemed him with five-colored sheep pelts from Chu. It was also said that Bai Li Xi favored wearing a five-colored sheep pelt robe and was called "Five-Zhu Duke." Both Tang and Mu were sages and virtuous rulers, able to attract worthy men, so they obtained these two individuals, using them as able ministers. They did so by following their natural inclinations.

**[4] Exegesis:** To follow their inclinations is to make all things in the world effortless to obtain; to constrain their nature and forcefully capture them is never possible.

**[5] Annotation:** The Sage’s Way is to act without knowing, yet still in accordance—this is what is meant by "skillful in Heaven."
**Exegesis:** Whether Heaven or humanity, he sees no distinction between them, acting in total alignment. The earlier passages spoke of Heaven and humanity as separate, yet here they are merged—no distinction is seen between them. *Wú* (吾, "my") is the author’s self-referential term.

**[6] Exegesis:** The Sage honors without delight, insults without anger—only those who align with Heaven’s harmony can do this. His anger emerges from non-anger; his action arises from non-action. To seek tranquility, he balances his *qi*; to seek divinity, he follows his heart. When forced to act, he does so out of necessity—this is the Dao of the Sage.

**[Annotations for *wēi* (威):]**
**[1]** *Wēi* (威) as *hū* (或, "perhaps") per the *Lìwén* (释文) variant.
**[2]** *Wēi* (威) as *wú* (无, "none") per the *Lìwén* (释文) variant. *Wú* (无) here means "no possibility of."」

**[7] Exegesis:**

**[1] Annotation:**
*Huà* (画) is what adorns one’s appearance. Since the mutilated man’s form is already impaired and ruined, he no longer cares for praise or blame—thus he *zhuǐ* (拸) and discards it.

**Commentary:**
*Jiè* (介) means "mutilated." *Zhuǐ* (拸) means "to abandon." *Huà* (画) means "adornment." Adornment and fine attire are meant to enhance one’s bearing, but a mutilated man’s appearance is already ruined. Thus, he no longer concerns himself with honor or disgrace—he abandons all such adornment.

**Textual Notes:**
The character *jiè* (介) is pronounced *jiè* (界) in sound. Guo (郭) says: "It means mutilated." Another reading, *qià* (黠), is also attested. The *Guangya* (广雅) defines it as "alone." The Chu (崔) version renders it as *wú* (兀). *Zhuǐhuà* (拸画) is pronounced *chìzhǐ* (敕纸) or *tā* (他), also *zhǐ* (纸). It is also written as *yí* (移). Sima (司马) says: *"Huà* (画) refers to adornments for the body; since he lacks limbs, he no longer cherishes them." Another interpretation: *yí* (移) means "to depart." Chu (崔) says: *"Zhuǐhuà* (拸画) means to disregard conventional standards."

◎Yu Yü (俞樾) notes: Guo’s annotation states that *huà* (画) adorns appearance, and since the mutilated man’s form is ruined, he no longer cares for praise or blame—thus he abandons adornment. However, the phrase *"wài fēiyù"* (外非誉) seems better explained by disregarding conventions rather than mere appearance. Chu’s interpretation—that *zhuǐhuà* (拸画) means to disregard conventional standards—is more fitting. In the *Han Shu* (汉书), Sima Xiangru’s biography mentions *"āi yǐ lùlí"* (痑以陆离), where Zheng Xu (师古) annotates: *"āi* (痑) means self-indulgence." This aligns with the meaning of *zhuǐ* (拸). In the *Guoliang Zhuan* (谷梁传) of the sixth year of Duke Huan, *"yǐ qǐ wǒ"* (以其画我) is rendered *"huà wǒ"* (化我) in the *Gongyang Zhuan* (公羊传), with He Xu (何休) explaining: *"Unseemly conduct is called *huà* (化)."* This too aligns with the meaning of *huà* (画). Truly, once a man’s limbs are mutilated, he no longer cares for his body, and neither praise nor blame affects him—thus he disregards all conventions.

The character *bùfù* (不复) is pronounced *fúyòu* (扶又).

**[2] Annotation:**
He has no reliance on life, so he fears not death.

**Commentary:**
*Xūmǐ* (胥靡) refers to convict laborers. A son of a thousand gold pieces naturally values his life, but a slave or convict does not hold his own life dear. Since he does not cherish it, he ascends heights without fear.

**Textual Notes:**
Sima (司马) says: *"Xūmǐ* (胥靡) are convict laborers." Another interpretation: *"Xūmǐ* (胥靡) refers to those with *liè* (癃, urinary incontinence)."

Cui Yun: *"This refers to castration."* **[3] [Annotation]:** He does not recognize what others hold dear. **[Commentary]:** *"Kui"* (馈), originally also written as *"kui"* (愧), should be read according to the character. Now, returning to one’s innate nature, all things are accomplished through it. Since he does not abandon himself to serve others, he casts aside shame and gratitude, thus forgetting the Dao of human relationships.

Compare it to limbs or clothing—each serves its function in mutual reliance. How could one ever express gratitude for their use?

**[Textual Notes]:** *"Fu"* (夫复) is pronounced *fú* (服), *fúyòu* (扶又).
*"Xu"* (謵) is pronounced *xí* (习).
*"Bùkuì"* (不馈) is pronounced *qìkuì* (其愧).
The *Guangya* states: *"Kui"* (馈) means *"to abandon"* or *"to give away."* Another pronunciation is *"kui"* (愧).
The *Yuanjia* edition reads *"kui"* (愧).
*"While forgetting others"*—*"fu"* (复) here means *"to repay"* or *"to reciprocate."*
*"Xu"* (謵) means *"to indulge"* or *"to play with."*
Now, those who indulge in habits, even in small matters, hold them dear. Yet, if one repays or reciprocates what they have received without returning it in gratitude, this is the utmost foolishness—one who fails to grasp what others cherish. Without reciprocity, there is no human connection, hence *"forgetting others."*

◎ *Jiashishi Fu* says: *"Fei yu"* (非誉) is used interchangeably with *"huǐ yù"* (毁誉, praise and blame). This refers to criticizing his vulgarity. To disregard praise and blame, to abandon life and death, and to forget oneself—this is the case. To repay without gratitude and forget others is to forget propriety.

The *Shuowen Jiezi* states: *"Xu"* (詟) is *"speech that loses its breath."* *"Xu"* (謵) is the same as *"xu"* (詟).
*"Fu xu"* (复謵) means when others speak in submission to coerce one, yet one responds in kind.

Zheng Xuan’s *Shiyi Li* commentary: *"Kui"* (馈) means *"to return"*—whether offering things to deities or humans, it is called *"kui."* To give things to others is *"kui,"* and to speak to comfort others is also *"kui."* *"Fu xu"* (复謵) *"bùkuì"* (不馈) means forgetting distinctions of rank. Forgetting others and oneself, one aligns with the harmony of Heaven.

**[Textual Notes]:** The annotation that *"xu"* (謵) is pronounced *"xí"* (习) and means *"to play with"* is incorrect.

**[4] [Annotation]:** Without human sentiment, one naturally becomes a *"tianren"* (天人, one in harmony with Heaven and humanity).

**[Commentary]:** Following the natural inclinations of Heaven, forgetting human conventions, and thus merging with the principles of nature.

**[5] [Annotation]:** Even those with mutilated bodies and convict laborers align with Heaven’s harmony—how much more so those who naturally embody it!

**[Commentary]:** Aligning with Heaven’s harmony means transcending right and wrong, so one is treated with reverence without delight and with contempt without anger.

**[Textual Notes]:** *"Wu"* (侮) is pronounced *wú* (亡甫).

**[6] [Annotation]:** This expresses the idea that *"wu"* (无, non-being) cannot generate *"you"* (有, being), yet *"you"* cannot act as *"wu."*

**[Commentary]:** Those who act in anger or action are not those who do not act in anger. Thus, one who follows non-action and non-anger is truly aligned. Knowing this, one understands that action originates from non-action, and anger from non-anger. Cultivating this awareness, one remains unperturbed by contempt.

**[7] [Annotation]:** Balancing *qi* (气) brings stillness; sufficiency in principle harmonizes the mind, and divine efficacy manifests. When acting out of necessity, all deeds are just. Thus, the Sage takes this as the Dao—seeking non-action beyond mere emptiness!

**[Commentary]:** *"Yuan"* (缘) means *"to follow"* or *"to conform."* To seek stillness through exertion requires regulating the will and *qi*. Divine transformations begin with surrendering the mind. To harmonize within action yet remain aligned with principle, one must conform to necessity. Necessity means responding naturally to stimuli—what lies within one’s duty. Such examples are why the Sage upholds this as the true Dao.

**[Collation Note]:** The characters *"xu"* (謵) and *"xi"* (詟) were originally reversed; corrected according to the *Shuowen Jiezi*.

**Volume Eight: *Zapian* – *Xu Wu Gui* (徐无鬼) [Twenty-Fourth]**

**[1] [Textual Notes]:** The chapter is named after the person, Xu Wu Gui.

Xu Wu Gui, by way of female official Shang, visited Wei Wu Hou. Wei Wu Hou comforted him: *"Master, you must be weary! Suffering from the toil of mountain forests, you have thus deigned to see me."*

**[1] [Commentary]:** Xu Wu Gui was surnamed Xu, with the courtesy name Wu Gui—a recluse. Female Shang was a minister of Wei. Wei Wu Hou, named Ji, was the son of Wei Wen Hou and the tenth-generation descendant of Bi Wan. Xu Wu Gui wished to admonish Wei Wu Hou, so he used the minister as an intermediary to seek an audience.

**[Textual Notes]:** *"Xu Wu Gui"* (徐无鬼) was a recluse from Mount Mian in Wei. Sima Qian’s text reads *"Mian Mountain recluse Xu Wu Gui."* *"Female Shang"* (女商) was a person’s name. Li [Fan] says: *"Xu Wu Gui and Female Shang were both favored ministers of Wei."*

**[2] [Commentary]:** Having long dwelled in the mountains, enduring hardship, poverty, and illness, he suddenly lowered his aspirations, mingling with the world. His heart was moved, and the ruler sought to console him.

**[Textual Notes]:** *"Wu Hou labored him"* (武侯劳之) is pronounced *lìbào* (力报). The single character *"mountain forests"* (山林) is read as-is; the rest follow the same pronunciation as the next chapter.

Xu Wu Gui replied: *"I am the one wearying you, my lord! What labor could you have for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, your vital essence will falter. If you suppress your desires and restrain your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will suffer. I seek to weary you—what labor could you have for me?"*

Wei Wu Hou remained silent in detached composure.

**[1] [Annotation]:** Desires and aversions, internal and external, find no resolution.

**[Commentary]:** *"Pì"* (黜) means *"to dismiss."* *"Zhān"* (掔) means *"to withdraw."* If desires overflow and aversions deepen, the vitality of life weakens. If desires are suppressed and aversions withdrawn, the body becomes unbalanced, causing ears and eyes to suffer. Thus, I seek to console you—how could you have time to weary me?

**[Textual Notes]:** *"Yíng qí"* (盈耆) is pronounced *shízhì* (时志). The same pronunciation applies below and in the annotation.

「《长》 (Dīng zhàng) is pronounced *dīng zhàng* (丁丈).
《好》 (hào) is pronounced *hūbào* (呼报).
The same pronunciation applies below in the annotations and chapters.

《恶》 (wù) is pronounced *wūlù* (乌路).
The same pronunciation applies below in the annotations and chapters.

《黜》 (chù) is pronounced *chùlǜ* (敕律), meaning **"to dismiss"** or **"to retreat."** It is also written as *chù* (出), with the same sound.
司马 (Sīmǎ) reads it as *duō* (咄).

《掔》 (qiān) is pronounced *kǔtián* (苦田) or *kǒuxián* (口闲), meaning **"to fix"** or **"to withdraw."**
《尔雅》 (Ěryǎ) says: **"to hold firm."**
崔 (Cuī) says: **"to draw away."**
司马 (Sīmǎ) says: **"to pull."**

**[二] [Annotation]:** This is a repetition of the previous meaning.

**[三] [Annotation]:** He did not speak to him.

**[Commentary]:** *"Chāorán"* (超然) means **"detached"** or **"lost in thought."** Since his words did not accord with the situation, he remained lost in thought and did not respond.
[释文] 司马 (Sīmǎ) says: *"Chāorán"* (超然) is like **"lost in thought."**

**[Textual Notes]:** *"不说"* (bùshuō) is pronounced *yuè* (悦). The same pronunciation applies below in the larger text.

A little while later, Xu Wu Gui said: **"I once told you that I perceived you as a dog【一】. The lower kind of dog clings to its food until sated, which is the virtue of a weasel【二】; the middle kind gazes at the sun【三】, and the highest kind seems to have lost its body【四】. My perception of you as a dog is still not as favorable as my perception of you as a horse【五】. When I perceive you as a horse, the straight one fits the plumb line【六】, the crooked one fits the hook【七】, the square one fits the compass【八】, the round one fits the circle【九】—this is the finest horse of a feudal state【一０】, yet it is still not as grand as the finest horse in the world【一一】. The finest horse in the world has natural excellence【一一】—it appears anxious, as if it has lost something【一二】, or as if it has forgotten its body【一三】. Such a horse surpasses all others, leaving dust far behind, and its source is unknown【一三】."**

Wei Wu Hou was greatly delighted and laughed【一四】.

**[一] [Commentary]:** Having observed that Wei Wu Hou was lost in thought and not pleased, he spoke of dogs and horses to test his reaction, hoping to cheer his heart.

**[二] [Commentary]:** He holds firm to his emotions and desires, only coveting food, and his nature is as greedy as a weasel—this is the lowest kind of dog.

**[三] [Commentary]:** His spirit and *qi* are lofty and distant, gazing as far as the sun, and his physique is such—this is the middle kind of dog.

**[四] [Commentary]:** The "one" refers to the **body**. His *qi* and spirit are steady and resolute, as if he has forgotten his own body—this is the highest kind of dog.

**[六] [Commentary]:** Refers to the **horse’s front teeth**.

**[七] [Commentary]:** Refers to the **horse’s neck**.

**[八] [Commentary]:** Refers to the **horse’s head**.

**[九] [Commentary]:** Refers to the **horse’s eyes**.

**[一０] [Commentary]:** Combining the above perceptions, this is the finest horse among the feudal states.

**[一一] [Commentary]:** His virtue and talent are naturally complete, requiring no training—this is the finest horse in the world, the kind the sovereign rules over.

**[一二] [Commentary]:** His eyes seem to look back anxiously, as if he is worried; his hooves move slowly, yet he appears to be fleeing—his spirit and appearance suggest he has forgotten himself. Such a horse is the finest under Heaven.

**[一三] [Commentary]:** *"Yì"* (轶) means **"to surpass."** His swift gallop exceeds all other horses, swift as the wind, leaving dust far behind—since this excellence is not taught, its source is unknown.

**[一四] [Annotation]:** The words of a true person are how modest! Only what is pleasing to the senses can delight him.

**[Commentary]:** Xu Wu Gui spoke at the right moment, so Wei Wu Hou laughed and was delighted.

When Xu Wu Gui departed, Nǚ Shāng said: **"Master, why did you alone delight my lord? I delight my lord by speaking of poetry, books, rites, and music when he is at ease, and by discussing military strategies—golden armor and six *zhuó* (弢) of chariots—when I address him formally. Those who serve him well are countless, yet my lord has never opened his mouth to speak【三】."**

Now, Master, how did you alone bring such delight to my lord that he rejoices as he does【四】?

---
**[一] [Commentary]:** Having finished discussing matters, he took his leave. Nǚ Shāng, wondering at the king’s laughter, thus inquired of Xu Wu Gui.

**[二] [Commentary]:** *"Poetry, books, rites, and music"*—these are the Six Classics. *"Golden armor and six zhuó"* refers to the titles of *Zhōu Shū* (周书), or some say, secret prophecies. Originally written as *"six táo"* (六韬), meaning the *Six Táos* of Tàigōng—namely, *Wén*, *Wǔ*, *Hǔbào*, *Lóngquǎn*—and the six *zhuó* (弢). *"Horizontal"* means distant; *"following"* means close. Since Wú Hóu favored martial matters and despised the literary arts, he treated military strategy as the *"following"* and the Six Classics as *"horizontal."*

---
**[三] [Annotation]:** It is only the *Lèyīn* (乐鴳) that delights with bells and drums, so he is troubled. ◎ Qìng Fàn notes in the *Wén Xuǎn* annotation of Guō Jǐngpú’s *"You Xiān"* (游仙) poem that *"start amǐ"* (启齿) means *"to smile."* The *Shìwén* entry is omitted.

**[Release Text]:** *"Yǐ shuō"* (以说) as written, or with the reading *shǐruì* (始锐). All below follow the same.
Sīmǎ (司马) renders it as *"yuè"* (悦).
*"Zòng shuō"* (从说) reads *zǐróng* (子容).
*"Jīnbǎn"* (金版) is also written as *"bǎn"* (板), read as *bóbǎn* (薄版), or as written.
◎ Lú Wénpián (卢文弨) notes: *"Today’s text reads as ‘bǎn’ (板)."*
*"Liù zhuó"* (六弢) reads *tǔdāo* (吐刀).
Sīmǎ and Chuǐ (崔) say: *"Jīnbǎn liù zhuó"* (金版六弢) are all titles from *Zhōu Shū*. Some say: secret (*shì*) oracles (*yì*).
Originally also written as *"liù táo"* (六韬), referring to Tàigōng’s *Six Táos*—*Wén*, *Wǔ*, *Hǔbào*, *Lóngquǎn*—and the six *zhuó*.
*"Lè"* (乐) pronounced *luò* (洛).

「Chapter’s ending is the same.

*"Yàn"* (鴳) is pronounced *jiàn* (谏) with the reading *yì* (谏) reversed.

**[Section Four] [Commentary]**
Serving the martial lord (武侯) with utmost loyalty and integrity, one might offer counsel or dissent—yet even so, one’s merits would stand out. Such devoted ministers are countless, yet my lord has never once opened his mouth to utter even the faintest smile (微笑).

Now, what art (術) do you possess, Master, to bring such joy (欢说) to my lord?

**[Release Text]**
*"Wújūn yuè"* (吾君说) is pronounced *yuè* (悦).

**[Collation]**
The character *yì* (谶) is corrected according to the *Release Text*’s original form.

Xú Wúguǐ (徐无鬼) said: *"I merely told my lord of the dogs and horses."*

**[Commentary]**
Medicine has no rank—what heals the ailment is good. Thus, he simply told the lord of the dogs and horses, with no further embellishment.

Nǚ Shāng (女商) said: *"Is that so?"*

**[Commentary]**
Does he mean to say that he directly told the lord of the dogs and horses? He finds this art too shallow and thus asks in wonder.

He replied: *"Have you not heard of the exiles from Yue?*
After a few days away, they rejoice at seeing those they know;
After a month or two, they rejoice at seeing those they once saw in their homeland;
And when a year has passed, they rejoice at seeing even those who resemble people—
Is it not that the longer they are separated, the deeper their longing grows?

Those who flee into empty voids (虚空), clinging to the narrow paths of *lǐliè* (藜藋) and *qúyòu* (鼪鼬), stumble along in their desolation—yet they delight at hearing the faint footsteps of others, and even more so,
When brothers and kinsmen cough and call beside them!

For long has there been none to speak true words (真人之言) and thus provoke the lord’s laughter (謦欬) at his side!"*

---
**Annotations:**
- *武侯* (Wǔhóu): "Martial Lord" (refers to Zhuge Liang, a historical figure)
- *藜藋* (lǐliè): "Wild plants" (symbolizing harsh, barren conditions)
- *鼪鼬* (qúyòu): "Weasels" (narrow, winding paths)
- *謦欬* (qīngkài): "Coughing and calling" (loud, joyous sounds)

「["One"] **Annotation:** Each reflects on what brings them delight in their own nature.
**Commentary:** Those exiled far from home, whether for crimes against the law or unjust governance, leave their native land. Just a few days after their departure, they suddenly encounter an acquaintance—how could they not feel joy and relief at once! This is the first analogy.

**Textual Notes:** *越* (yuè) means "far." Sima [Zhenru] notes that *流人* (liú rén) refers to those who have been exiled for their crimes. *数日* (shǔ rì) is read with a reversed tone for *日*.

["Two"] **Commentary:** As time passes, homesickness intensifies. Though not familiar, they see someone from their homeland—a former acquaintance—and rejoice at the sight.

["Three"] **Annotation:** If one finds what they desire, they cease longing; without longing, they forget why they rejoiced in the first place.
**Commentary:** A year after their exile, the distance grows greater, so they take delight in seeing someone who resembles a fellow villager. Is it not because the longer they are separated from home, the deeper their longing becomes? The Martial Lord, who loved dogs and horses, had long been detached from affairs of state—like those exiled, he suddenly heard laughter and talk, and his spirits lifted. This is the second analogy.

**Textual Notes:** *及期* (jí qī) is pronounced as *基* (jī).」

「**Exegesis:**
The *Fu Tao* ("Escaping") is rendered *xún* ("to patrol") in the *Shiji* version.
*The Xu Kong zhe* ("The Vacant Space")—the *Shiji* explains: "The ruins of old burial mounds, left desolate."
*Lí* ("prickly chaffvine") is pronounced *lì-xī* (力西).
*Hù* ("mallow") is pronounced *tú-diào* (徒吊).
The original text sometimes uses [□] (homophonous with *hù*).
*Zhù* ("blocking") is pronounced *zhú-jǔ* (诛矩), the *Shiji* glossing it as "to obstruct."
*Shēng* ("weasel") is pronounced *shēng* (生) or *xìng* (姓).
*Hú* ("weasel") is pronounced *yóu-jiù* (由救).
*Zhī jìng* ("the path")—the original also uses *jìng* (径), the *Shiji* explaining: "Path, meaning *dào* (Way)." The original also uses *jì* (迹), while the *Yuán Jiā* version uses *dié* (迭), pronounced *yì* (逸). Chu Hong notes: *Dié* is *jì* (迹).
◎ Qingfan notes: *Lí* (prickly chaffvine) is *hāo* (蒿). *Hù* (mallow) is the modern *huì hù* (灰藋). The *Erya* records *bài-shāng hù* (拜商藋), with Guo Pu’s annotation: "Shang hù resembles *lí* (prickly chaffvine)." Both *lí* and *hù* grow in uncultivated lands, towering above men, forcing passage—hence the *Shiji*’s *Zhongni’s Disciples* transmission: "Sorting through prickly chaffvine and mallow." Here, the "path blocked by weasels and weasels" is likewise described as towering.
*Liáng wèi qí kōng* ("the noble in his vacancy")—the *Shiji* explains: *Liáng* (noble) means *liángrén* (良人, "the virtuous man"), referring to the one who patrols the void. *Wèi qí kōng* means "to dwell amid the emptiness." *Liáng* is sometimes written *liàng* (踉), homophonous.
◎ Lu Wenbian notes: Modern script writes *liáng* as *liàng*.
◎ Jia Shìfù notes: In the *Exegesis*, *liáng wèi qí kōng*, the *Shiji* glosses: "The virtuous man, referring to the one who patrols the void." *Liáng* is sometimes written *liàng*. Referencing the *Qiúshuǐ* chapter’s "leaping *liàng* upon the well’s beam," one version uses *tiàoliàng* (跳踉). Pan Anren’s *Shooting Pheasants* ode describes one who "staggered *liàng* and then came leisurely." The *Yùpiàn* defines *liàng* (踉) as "rapid movement." Here, the path of prickly chaffvine, mallow, weasels, and weasels has gaps—one staggers *liàng* within them. The *Shuōwén* defines *qiāng* (跄) as a motion, while *shū* (舒) speech is *qiāngliàng*, and hurried speech is *liàng*. The *Exegesis* errs.
*Qìrán* ("joyfully") is pronounced *gǒu-jù-gōng* (郭巨恭), *lǐ-qū-gōng* (李曲恭), or *qū-yǒng* (曲勇), meaning "startled," or *xú-gǔ-jiāng* (徐苦江), *qú-héng* (袪扃). The *Shiji* glosses it as "a joyful expression." Chu Hong notes: "The sound of a traveler’s footsteps."
*Ér xǐ yǐ* ("and rejoiced")—Li Feng notes: "This illustrates the Martial Lord’s lack of sovereign virtue, confined to defense—though stern in court, it displeased him. Yet when he heard what he longed for, like an exile hearing human voices, how could he not brighten with joy and smile in relief?"
*Qīng* ("laughing") is pronounced *kǔ-dǐng* (苦顶) or *qìng* (罄).
*Kè* ("coughing") is pronounced *kǔ-ài* (苦爱) or *qì* (器).
Li Feng notes: "*Qīngkè* (laughing and coughing) signifies speech and laughter. Even hearing a familiar voice brings great joy—how much more so with kin and loved ones’ laughter!"

**Fourth Annotation:**
This is why he never spoke.

The True Man’s words, by which he won my lord, are natural.
At first, he was delighted to receive them; but with time, he forgot their worth.

**Exegesis:**
The Martial Lord longed to hear of dogs and horses—his exile had lasted long. Like a fugitive, weary from travel, his homesickness deepened. Now, with the True Man’s teachings from the *Six Classics* and the *Taigong’s Military Methods* beside him—laughter and speech—this was not fitting. This unites the previous analogies.

**Exegesis of Text:**
*Jiǔ yǐ fú* ("Long has it been") is pronounced *fú* (扶). This follows the later placement.
**Collation:**
(1) The *Hǎizhāng* version of Zhang Junfang’s text omits *yú* (于) before *jù* (俱), reading as *hù* (乎).
(2) The *Shìdé Táng* version also uses *ér* (而).

When Xu Wúguǐ visited the Martial Lord, the Martial Lord said:
*"Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating *zhú-lì* (橡栗) and weary of *jiū* (韭). You have honored me for long!
Now, are you old? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or is it that I, your lord, have the blessings of the state’s altars?"*

**First Annotation:**
*Gān* (求) means "to seek."
Long dwelling in the mountains, sustaining oneself on vegetables and fruits, aging and weary—would one not seek nourishment to sustain their declining years? Perhaps to inherit virtue and secure the ancestral temples.

**Exegesis of Text:**
*Zhú-lì* ("acorns") is pronounced *shù* (序) or *shí-rǔ* (食汝). The original also uses *zhú-lì* (橡栗).
◎ Qingfan notes: The *Shuōwén* defines *zhú* (橡) as the fruit of *qiú* (栩), stating: "Qiú is *zāo* (□, same as 芓), its fruit is grass-like. (Modernly borrowed as *cǎo* (草), colloquially *zào* (皂).)" Another entry: "Cǎodǒu (草斗), the fruit of *lì* (栎), also called *yàng* (样)." Gao You annotates *Lǚshì Chūnqiū*: "Zhú (橡), *zàodǒu* (皂斗), resembling chestnuts." The *Shiji*’s *Xiàngrú Zhuan* has Yǐng Shào’s annotation: "Lì (栎) is a timber tree." Observing these, *lì* is also called *qiú*, *zāo*, or *cǎi*; its fruit is called *zào* or *yàng*. Thus, *yàng* is the fruit of *cǎi*. The *Shiji*’s annotation here refers to soft acorns, so *cǎi* is also called *yàng*.
The *Shuōwén*’s *yàng* (样) character is now written *zhú* (橡) in transmitted texts. (Note: In the *Shān Mù Piān*, *zhú-lì* (杼栗) appears as *zhú-lì* (芧栗) in the *Xu Wúguǐ Piān*, showing *zhú* (芧), *zāo* (□), and *zhù* (杼) are interchangeable. The *Huáinán Běn Jīng*’s *líng-zhù-zī-bào* (菱杼紾抱) is annotated by Gao: "Zhù (杼) is the fruit of *cǎi* (采)." Wang Yirang states: "Zhù (杼) is watergrass. *Zhù* read as *zhú* (芧), also written *zhù* (苎)." The *Shiji*’s *Xiàngrú Zhuan*’s *Shànglín Fú* has *Jiǎng Zhú Qīngtán* (蒋芧青薠), with Zhāng Yì’s note: "Zhú (芧) is *sānjiān* (三棱)." In the *Wénxuàn*, *zhú* is written *zhù* (苎). Those writing *zhù* use the character, while *zhú* borrows it.
*Jiū* ("scallions") is pronounced *jiǔ* (久). Some later texts incorrectly place [□] beneath it.
◎ Lu Wenbian notes: [□] is the grass radical; [□] beneath is the vulgar *jiū* (韭) character.

The old character □ was originally written as 廾, which is an error; it has now been corrected.

◎ *Yǐ Bīn* (以宾) must be read as *yǐ-rèn* (必刃反). The original was sometimes written as *bīn* (摈). Sima Qian states: "摈 means to abandon." It was also sometimes read as *yǐ-rén* (必人反). Li (likely Li Fan) says: "It means guest or visitor."

◎ *Yù Gān* (欲干), Li says: "干 means to seek."

◎ *Shè-Jì zhī fú yé* (社稷之福邪), Li says: "This refers to offering good counsel and wise plans that can benefit the state and its people."

---

【校】(1) The character *zāo* (皂) is amended according to Lü Buwei’s *Chūnqiū* annotations. Xu Wúguǐ states: "Xu Wugui, born in poverty and lowly station, never dared to eat or drink the food and meat offered by his lord, but came to serve him." (2)

【疏】Though living in poverty and obscurity, content in mountains and thickets, how could he desire to glut himself with food and drink for mere sustenance? No! He came to labor for his lord. The lord asked: "What is this? Why would you labor for me, your humble servant?" (3)

【疏】Here, *dá* (奚) means "why." The lord inquires about his intentions. The reply is: "I come to labor for your lordship’s virtue and body." (4)

【疏】Since food cravings are insatiable and physical labor exhausts the spirit, he merely seeks to comfort him.

◎ The Wúhòu of the *Bā* (武) asked: "What does *yé* (邪) mean?" (5)

【疏】The lord asks what his words imply.

Xu Wúguǐ replied: "The nourishment of Heaven and Earth is uniform **[1]**, ascending heights cannot be deemed excessive, nor dwelling in the lowly deemed insufficient. Yet your lordship alone is the sovereign of a great state, causing the people of the land to suffer **[2]** in order to feed your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth **[3]**. The Dao **[4]** does not indulge itself without limit **[5]**.

The Dao loves harmony and abhors deceit **[6]**. Deceit is a malady, hence the labor **[7]**. What malady does your lordship possess that you do not recognize? **[8]**

**[1] [Annotation]** He does not claim it for himself but allows it to proceed without restraint.

**[1] [Commentary]** Heaven and Earth are the two fundamental principles, their blessings pervade all beings. In providing sustenance, they are universally impartial, not indulging in excess or luxury for any single entity. These words are Xu Wúguǐ’s admonition to his lord.

**[2] [Annotation]** This is so, contrary to the balance of Heaven and Earth.

**[2] [Commentary]** Ascending to high station as a noble does not mean one should take pleasure in it as if it were endless; dwelling in lowliness as the common folk does not mean one should burden them as if it were insufferable. Yet your lordship alone boasts the might of a great state, causing the people of this land to endure hardship, indulging in the pleasures of color, sound, fragrance, and taste to satiate your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. This defies the natural order of Heaven and Earth, and I fear your lordship will not take this path.

**[3] [Annotation]** He merely grants it to others.

**[3] [Commentary]** The sage sovereign and the enlightened person treat all beings with equanimity, never excessively craving flavors and tastes for themselves.

**[4] [Annotation]** Harmony is sharing with all things; indulgence is deceit.

**[4] [Commentary]** The enlightened and virtuous seek to align with all things and abhor private excess.

**[5] [Commentary]** Deceit refers to private gain at the expense of righteousness; this is what is meant by malady. Your lordship alone suffers from this malady—how deep is your affliction?

**[Annotation]** *Ji* (几), near.

**[Annotation]** *Chéng* (成), accomplishment; *féi* (伐), conquest.

**[Annotation]** *Biàn* (变), deviation.

**[9] [Annotation]** *Lì* (丽), beautiful; *qiáo* (谯), watchtower.

**[10] [Annotation]** *Zī* (锱), a fine horse; *bān* (坛), altar.

**[11] [Annotation]** *Nì* (逆), contrary.

**[12] [Annotation]** *Qiǎo* (巧), cleverness.

**[13] [Annotation]** *Móu* (谋), strategy.

**[14] [Annotation]** *Zhàn* (战), warfare.

**[Commentary]** If your lordship persists in this course, cultivate sincerity in your heart to respond to the sentiments of Heaven and Earth without provoking discord **[16]**. For if the people perish, how could your lordship still employ the cessation of warfare? **[17]**

**[Commentary]** The appearance of loving the people will only be a facade, for the people will not truly revere it. The practice of righteousness to halt warfare will only incite competition, for the name of righteousness will provoke rivalry. Even if one wishes to cease warfare, how could it be achieved when father and son, ruler and subject, deceive one another with false affections?

**[Commentary]** If you proceed with this path, you will be close to ruining the foundation of *wuwei* **[18]**. The deeds of benevolence and righteousness, the accomplishments of halting arms and refining culture, though their traces may appear, will only lead others to emulate them in falsehood. The harm to the people and the provocation of warfare begin from here.

**[Commentary]** *Ji* (几), near.

**[Commentary]** Benevolence and righteousness, though they have outward forms, will inevitably give rise to further forms. Once the initial traces are established, subsequent actions must follow.

**[Commentary]** When achievements and reputation are attained, contention and rivalry will inevitably arise, leading to conquest and warfare.

**[Commentary]** When one alters laws and deviates from natural order, it will only bring harm to the people, provoking external enemies and fostering more conflicts and wars.

**[Annotation]** *Wuwei* (无为), non-action.

**[Commentary]** The lord of Wú **[19]** asked: "Is this feasible?"

**[Commentary]** *Ji* (几), near.

**[Commentary]** The traces of benevolence, righteousness, and halting arms are already manifest, and others will follow suit, making them instruments of harm. Though your lordship may profess benevolence and righteousness, you are perilously close to hypocrisy.

**[Commentary]** *Ji* (几), near.

**[Commentary]** The lord of Wú **[19]** said: "I have long wished to meet you, Master. I desire to love my people and uphold righteousness while ceasing warfare—is this possible?"

**[Commentary]** *Ji* (几), near.

**[Commentary]** To cultivate the benevolent virtue of loving the people and the righteous act of halting warfare, to refine culture and cease arms—such governance, though its traces may appear, will only be a means for others to emulate in falsehood. Thus, it becomes the very instrument that harms the people and provokes warfare.

**[Commentary]** *Ji* (几), near.

**[Commentary]** The people will merely follow the outward appearance of benevolence and righteousness, not embracing their true essence.

**[Commentary]** Benevolence and righteousness both have outward forms, and thus the initial traces established will inevitably lead to further actions.

**[Commentary]** *Ji* (

The false gives rise to form and contrivance, and yet there is also conquest—this is not the original intent, but a shift in circumstances. Once falsehood and conquest arise, how could there be no war?

**Family Tradition (家世父曰):**
To feign virtue and righteousness for reputation, to daily display the forms of virtue and righteousness in one’s breast, yet to arbitrarily shape all that conforms to these forms—when one achieves the name of virtue and righteousness, one grows self-conceited.

**Small Yá (小尔雅):**
*Fá* (伐), to boast. This means boasting of one’s own merits.

Virtue (仁) [Righteousness (义)] can be arbitrarily shaped, yet it is not truly settled within. There must be internal shifts. When shifts occur, the ears, eyes, hands, and feet all lose their natural function, and joy, anger, sorrow, and delight violate their proper measure—this is external war. All deliberate actions are perilous.

*Hè liè* (鹤列), arraying troops.
*Lì qiáo* (丽谯), a high tower.

Sima (司马) says: *Hè liè*, drums and gongs.
*Lì* (丽), as in the character; also read *lì zhì* (力智反) and *lì zhī* (力支反).
*Qiáo* (谯), originally also written as *zhào* (嶕), pronounced *xiāo* (逍反).
Sima, Guo, and Li all say: *Lì qiáo*, the name of a tower—ornate and towering.

**[Ten] [Commentary]**
Infantry are called *tú* (徒). One should not merely act righteously for the sake of loving the people, nor should one indulge in grand displays of soldiers and swift horses.

**[Explication (疏)]**
*Hè liè*, arraying troops—speaking of the orderly deployment of soldiers and horses, like cranes in formation.
*Lì qiáo*, a high tower—speaking of its ornate and towering height.
*Zhī tán* (锱坛), the name of a palace. The ruler should not merely stir the heart to cease warfare for the sake of righteousness, nor should he laboriously display soldiers beneath high towers, or swift horses in the palace grounds.

*Wú tú* (无徒): Sima says: *Tú* (徒), infantry.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* (史记) in the *Chen She World Family* (陈涉世家) mentions the Battle of Qiáo Gate (战谯门中). Yan Shigu (颜师古) annotates: "A high tower was built on the gate to observe the distance; such a tower is also called *qiáo* (谯)."

**[Eleven] [Commentary]**
If one gains but harbors treachery within, one loses [harmony].

**[Explication (疏)]**
Do not conceal treacherous intentions while falsely claiming gain.

*Wú cáng* (无藏): One version reads *zāng* (臧), matching Sima’s text.
*Nì yú dé* (逆于得): Sima’s version reads *dé* (德).
Li says: All unjust greed—acquiring and hoarding what is not right—this is harboring treachery within virtue. Who can greedily gain and yet not lose virtue? It is certain that one should not hoard but instead abandon it.
He also says: Greed is contrary to the Dao.

**[Twelve] [Commentary]**
Guard one’s simplicity, and each will have their own strengths—thus achieving balance.

**[Explication (疏)]**
Great skill appears clumsy; each should cultivate simplicity. None should contend with cunning to outdo others.

**[Thirteen] [Commentary]**
Follow true knowledge, and each will have their own strengths—thus achieving harmony.

**[Explication (疏)]**
Forgive the heart and abandon scheming; follow true knowledge. Do not vie with others in cleverness or swiftness.

**[Fourteen] [Commentary]**
Respond to things with the Dao; things submit, and there is no name for victory.

**[Explication (疏)]**
Act first with purity and simplicity; use the Dao to subdue others. Do not conquer through warfare.

**[Fifteen] [Commentary]**
If one does not know what constitutes goodness, then even if victorious, it is not true victory.

**[Explication (疏)]**
To act in accordance with Heaven and align with humanity—even if one exterminates evil and rebels—though one may destroy nations and slaughter people, it does not lose the people’s affection. If, however, one slaughters the people, annexes lands, and does so out of greed, nourishing oneself and indulging desires—though one may conquer enemies in battle and achieve victory over others, one does not know where this victory lies, nor whose goodness it truly serves.

**[Sixteen] [Commentary]**
If one cannot yet cease, then nothing surpasses cultivating the sincerity of one’s self.

**[Explication (疏)]**
Sincerity (*chéng*) is authenticity (*shí*). To disturb (*rǎn*) is to agitate (*rǎo*). When matters cannot be halted, one must govern the state. If one cultivates the authenticity within the heart—responding to the dual forces of Heaven and Earth in life and death—there is no need for laborious laws or agitation of the common people.

The armies are not arrayed for battle—this is not a retreat.

(When) the great harmony with Heaven and Earth is achieved, and the transformation is applied without contrivance, the people naturally overcome the remnants of evil, escaping harm and death. Why then labor over schemes and laws to lay down arms?

The Yellow Emperor was about to meet **Great Yuán** (大隗) at **Jùcí** (具茨) Mountain, with **Fāngmíng** (方明) as charioteer, **Chāngyǔ** (昌宇) riding beside him, **Zhāngruò** (张若) and **Xiūpéng** (謵朋) leading the front horses, and **Kūnhūn** (昆阍) and **Huágǔjī** (滑稽) following in the rear carriage. When they arrived at the wilds of **Xiāngchéng** (襄城), the seven sages were all bewildered and did not know where to seek the Way.

**[One] [Explication (疏)]**
The Yellow Emperor is **Xuānyuān** (轩辕). **Great Yuán** (大隗) refers to the Dao being vast and yet subtly empty and tranquil. It is also said: **Great Yuán** (大隗) is the name of an ancient sage. **Jùcí** (具茨) is the name of a mountain, located within the borders of **Yíngyáng** (荧阳) and **Mìxiàn** (密县), also called **Tàiyuán** (泰隗) Mountain. The Yellow Emperor, being a sage, had long contemplated profound truths, now desiring to seek the mysterious Dao, so he made his way to **Jùcí** Mountain.

**[Release Text (释文)]**
*Dàyuán* (大隗): Pronounced *wù* (隗) with the fifth tone. **Sīmǎ Cuī** (司马崔) reads it as **Tàiyuán** (泰隗). Some say: **Great Yuán** (大隗) is the name of a deity. Another says: **Great Dao** (大道). *Jùcí* (具茨): One version reads as *Cìcí* (次茨), same meaning. Pronounced *zī* (资) or *jiù* (疚) (according to **Sīmǎ** [司马]). A mountain name. **Sīmǎ** (司马) says: It is located east of **Yíngyáng Mìxiàn** (荥阳密县), now called **Tàiyuán** (泰隗) Mountain.

**[Two] [Explication (疏)]**
**Fāngmíng** (方明), **Huágǔjī** (滑稽), etc., are all names of people. "Riding beside" (*cānshèng* 骖乘) refers to the person on the right of the carriage. "Leading the front horses" (*qiánmǎ* 前马) means guiding ahead. "Following in the rear carriage" (*hòuchē* 后车) means accompanying behind.

**[Release Text (释文)]**
*Chāngyǔ* (昌宇): Pronounced *yǔ* (宇).
*Cānshèng* (骖乘): Pronounced *shèng* (乘) with the *zhéng* (绳) tone.
*Xiū* (謵): Pronounced *xí* (习). **Yuánjiā** (元嘉) reads it as *wèi* (谓).
*Péng* (朋): Pronounced *péng* (朋) with the **Shū** (舒) tone. **Cuī** (崔) reads it as *péng* (朋), the original also written as *péng* (朋), pronounced *dēng* (登) or *fú* (扶) with the *héng* (恒) tone.
◎ **Lú Wénfèn** (卢文弨) says: The current text reads as *Xiūpéng* (謵朋).
◎ **Qìngfàn** (庆藩) notes: *Péng* (朋) in **Cuī**’s (崔) version, as the character *péng* (朋) often confuses with *duō* (多). Ancient texts with the character *duō* (多) are mistakenly written as *péng* (朋), resembling its form. *Records of the Grand Historian* mentions the spirits, gods, rivers, and mountains of the Five Emperors, as well as their sacrifices and mountain ascents, with **Xú Guǎng** (徐广) stating: *Duō* (多) is also written as *péng* (朋). In *Book of Han*, **Hòuqùbìng** (霍去病) is noted for his merits as a military officer (*bù duō* 仆多), with **Shīgǔ** (师古) stating: The *Table of Meritous Subjects* reads it as *bù péng* (仆朋). All are errors from transmission.
(The *Zhōuzhègōngzhòngchǐ* (周策公仲侈) in *Hanzi* (韩子), *Shíguòpán* (十过篇), and *Book of Han*’s *Ancient and Modern Biographies* all read as **Gōngzhòngpéng** (公仲朋), which is also a (case of) (transmission) [[error]] [[correction]].)

*Qiánmǎ* (前马): **Sīmǎ** (司马) says: Two men guide ahead of the horses.
*Kūnhūn* (昆阍): Pronounced *hūn* (昏).
*Hua* (滑): Pronounced *gǔ* (骨).
*Gǔjī* (稽): Pronounced *jī* (鸡).
*Hòuchē* (后车): **Sīmǎ** (司马) says: Two men accompany behind the carriage.

**[Three] [Commentary]**
This refers to the names of the sages; once names arise, the Way is lost. Even if one seeks **Great Yuán** (大隗), how can one attain him?

**[Explication (疏)]**
*Dú* (涂) means "Way" (*dào*). In present-day **Lùzhōu** (汝州), there is **Xiāngchéng** County, located south of **Tàiyuán** (泰隗) Mountain, where the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao. From the Yellow Emperor onward to **Huágǔjī** (滑稽), there are seven sages in total. The commentary states: "Once names arise, the Way is lost," and even if one seeks **Great Yuán** (大隗), how can one attain him? This commentary is correct, so no further explanation is given.

**[Release Text (释文)]**
*Xiāngchéng zhī yě* (襄城之野): **Lǐ** (李) says: A place name.
*Qīshèng* (七圣): The Yellow Emperor (1), **Fāngmíng** (方明) (2), **Chāng** [□] (3), **Zhāngruò** (张若) (4), **Xiūpéng** (謵朋) (5), **Kūnhūn** (昆阍) (6), **Huágǔjī** (滑稽) (7).

While there, they encountered a boy tending horses, and asked him about the Way, saying: "Do you know of **Jùcí** (具茨) Mountain?" The boy replied: "Yes."

「【一】【Commentary】 The boy tending horses was a **Dao/Way**-attained individual. "Tending horses" is called *mù* (牧). While passing by, they encountered this boy and asked him about the **Dao/Way** and its location, saying: "Do you know the whereabouts of **Jùcí** (具茨) Mountain?"

【二】【Commentary】 "若" (*ruò*) means "you." "然" (*rán*) is equivalent to "yes" or "indeed." When asked about the mountain’s location, he replied, "I know." Then they asked: "Do you know the whereabouts of **Great Yuán** (大隗)?" He said: "Indeed."

【一】【Commentary】 "存" (*cún*) means "to be located." Again, when asked about the **Dao/Way**’s whereabouts, he replied that he knew its place. The Yellow Emperor exclaimed: "How extraordinary, this young boy! Not only does he know **Jùcí** (具茨) Mountain, but he also knows where **Great Yuán** (大隗) resides. I beg you, teach me how to govern the world."

【一】【Commentary】 The Emperor was astonished that the boy knew the **Dao/Way**’s location and thus inquired further about the principles and methods of universal governance.

The boy replied: "To govern the world is no different from this! Why bother with further matters? When I was young, I wandered freely within the **Six Hēng** (六合). I once suffered from **mào** (瞀) sickness, and an elder instructed me, saying: *'If you ride the Sun’s chariot and wander in the wilds of **Xiāngchéng** (襄城).'* Now that my illness has mostly subsided, I shall again roam beyond the **Six Hēng** (六合). To govern the world is no different from this. Why should I bother with further matters?"

【三】
The boy said: "If each thing simply follows its own nature, there is no need for intervention—only then can one govern the world."【一】
【Commentary】 *Deliberate inaction* (奚事) is the same as *what* (何) *is there to do*? *As* (若) *as* (如) one wishes to cultivate the governance of the world, it is also like tending to one’s own self. If the self is left without artificial interference, what can external things affect it? Hence, the ancient sages taught: *"I act with non-doing, and the people transform themselves."*【二】
To ride the Sun’s chariot and wander freely—*the Sun’s rising is the start of the journey, and its setting is the time to rest.*【二】
Within the **Six Hēng** (六合), I refer to the realm of dust and clamor. The **mào** (瞀) sickness is the vertigo and disorientation caused by wind. I speak of my youthful wandering in the domain of the **Dao/Way**, where my heart dwelled beyond the defilements of the world, yet I still suffered from vertigo and confusion, unable to grasp the true essence. Fortunately, the **Sage** (聖人) taught me to cultivate the **Dao/Way**—to labor by day and repose by night, to ride the Sun’s chariot in boundless roaming, thus dwelling in tranquility and wandering without constraint. The original text also has the reading *"作"* (zuò) as *dedicated*, meaning to ride the Sun’s chariot in constant renewal and transformation.

【Annotations】 *"少"* (shào) in *"予少"* (shào) is pronounced *shào* (as in 召). *"瞀"* (mào) is pronounced *mòdòu* (莫豆), though Guó (郭) reads it as *wù* (務). Lǐ (李) explains it as the appearance of vertigo, while Sīmǎ (司馬) says it should be read as *□* (omitted), meaning vertigo and *□* (omitted). *"長者"* (chángzhě) is pronounced *dīngzhàng* (丁丈). Sīmǎ (司馬) explains *"乘日之車"* (chéngrìzhīchē) as *riding the Sun as a chariot*, though the *Yuánjiā* (元嘉) edition reads *"居"* (jū) instead of *"車"* (chē).*【三】
The governance of the world has no greater principle than *self-abandonment* (自放任). Once self-abandonment is achieved, what can external things disturb? Hence, *"I act with non-doing, and the people transform themselves."*【三】
【Commentary】 *Syuan* (痊) means *to remove* (除). The illness of false perceptions and delusions has long been cured, yet my heart still roams among external things, stained by worldly attachments. Governing the self and governing the state—how can they differ? When the boundaries between self and external things blur, there is no need for intervention.

【Annotations】 *"少痊"* (shàochuán) is pronounced *qìquán* (七全). Lǐ (李) explains it as *to remove* (除). ◎Qìngfān (庆藩) notes that in the *Wénxuǎn* (文选), Pán Ānrén’s (潘安仁) *"Xiánjū Fù"* (闲居赋) commentary cites Sīmǎ (司馬) as saying *syuan* (痊) means *to remove* (除). The annotation for this character is omitted in the *Shìwén* (释文). *"且复"* (qiěfù) is pronounced *fúyòu* (扶又).

The Yellow Emperor said, *"Truly, governing the world is not what my son should be concerned with*【一】*. Though this be so, I beg to ask about governing the world*【二】*.*" The Little Boy declined to speak【三】.

【一】【Commentary】 The work is done by the people.
【二】【Commentary】 To let the people find their own way is the Dao.

【Annotations】 The Little Boy had nothing to say.
The Yellow Emperor again questioned him【一】.
The Little Boy replied, *"Governing the world—what is there to distinguish it from tending horses? It is merely to remove those things that harm the horses*【二】*.!"*

【一】【Commentary】 The Yellow Emperor earnestly pressed his inquiry upon the Little Boy.
【二】【Commentary】 Overfeeding is what harms the horses.
【Commentary】 Those who harm the horses are those who overstep the proper measure.
To govern oneself, one must first guard one’s proper measure—thus, the method of tending horses can be applied to nourishing the people.
Since the Yellow Emperor had questioned earnestly, the Little Boy gave this brief reply in response.

【Annotations】 *"去其"* (qùqí) is pronounced *qǐlǚ* (起吕).

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and kowtowed, addressing the Little Boy as *"Heavenly Master"* before withdrawing【一】.

【一】【Note】 The Master, by aligning with the natural Way and removing excess, has arrived at the Great Void.

【Commentary】 Having suddenly awakened to the sage’s words, he revered him with body and mind, withdrawing from extraneous matters to reach the Great Void—where the command rests in the natural Dao. Is this not my Master?

Those of wisdom grow discontent when deprived of contemplation【一】,
those of eloquence grow discontent when denied discourse【二】,
those of keen insight grow discontent when barred from sharp debate【三】—
all are ensnared by external things【四】.

【一】【Commentary】 In an age of hardship and peril, when calamities arise, the wise must ponder and strategize—if thwarted, they take no joy.

【二】【Commentary】 The eloquent, like the County River’s flow or the harmony of *zhìluó* music, find no sequence in speech—then they take no joy.

【三】【Commentary】 The alert and discerning, if denied the exchange of guest and host, or if their words clash like blades, take no joy.

【四】【Note】 Unable to find inner fulfillment, they seek pleasure in externals—thus they are ensnared.

Each is bound by what brings them joy, yet all things come unbidden—
not by force, but by their own nature.

【Commentary】 These men are each constrained by their own narrow paths,
unaware of the greater Way, ensnared by the things before them.

The aspiring scholar thrives in court【一】,
the capable commoner seeks official honor【二】,
the strongman takes pride in hardship【三】,
the bold take joy in peril【四】,
the martial delight in war【五】,
the ascetic clings to fame【六】,
the legalist excels in governance【七】,
the ritualist values decorum【八】,
the virtuous seek noble alliances【九】.

The farmer without fields to till grows restless【一０】,
the merchant without markets to trade in grows restless.

The commoner with daily labor is industrious【一一】,
the artisan with skilled craftsmanship grows strong【一二】.

The greedy fear poverty【一三】,
the arrogant grieve when power is not supreme【一四】.

Those who thrive on change delight in upheaval【一五】—
when opportunity arises, they cannot help but act【一六】.

These are all who conform to the seasons,
not swayed by what is easy【一七】,
driving their bodies and natures through all things,
never returning to their origin—
alas!【一八】

The *Release Text* ["Noble Alliance"] speaks of gatherings and assemblies. ◎ Master Jia Shi Fu says: *"Noble Alliance"* refers to mutual interaction and exchange, where virtue and righteousness are practiced among those who associate.

Zheng Xuan’s annotation in *The Doctrine of the Mean* reads: *"Ren"* (人) is pronounced as *"xiāng rén"* (相人), meaning "to inquire after one another." Thus, when people associate, benevolence becomes manifest, and it is for this reason that the virtuous hold such alliances in esteem. The *Release Text*’s claim that *"Noble Alliance"* refers to gatherings and assemblies is incorrect.

【一０】【Annotation】 When intentions align, their pursuits align—thus they associate. 【Exegesis】 *"Associate"* (比) means harmony and joy. In ancient times, markets were established around wells, hence the term *"market wells"* (市井). If one strays from their proper calling, discord must follow.

*Release Text*: *"Not Associate"* (不比) is pronounced *pí zhì* (毗志), as below.

◎ Yu Yü says: *"Associate"* (比) is interchangeable with *"regulate"* (庀). In the *Commentary on the Rites of Zhou*, the *Exegesis of the Suì Teacher* states that within the *Zhou Li*, wherever *"associate"* (比) appears, the earlier Zheng [Xuan] readings render it as *"regulate"* (庀). This is correct. In the *Annals of Lu*, it is said, *"Zǐ Jiāng will regulate the governance of the Ji Family,"* and again, *"He regulated his household affairs at night."* Wei Zheng’s annotation states: *"Regulate"* (庀) means *"to govern."* Farmers govern the cultivation of uncultivated land, so without such land, they have no governance to attend to. Merchants govern the affairs of markets, so without markets, they have no governance to attend to. Guo [Xingjian]’s annotation says: *"When intentions align, their pursuits align—thus they associate."* Thus, reading the original character is incorrect. *"Merchant"* (商贾) is pronounced *gǔ*.

【一一】【Annotation】 When labor fulfills its purpose, diligence follows. 【Exegesis】 Common folk each have their duties; morning and evening, they act in accordance with their nature, thus striving of their own accord.

【一二】【Annotation】 If work does not match one’s skill, laziness ensues. 【Exegesis】 *"Strong"* (壮) means *"flourishing."* The hundred craftsmen, each with their tools, when their work aligns with their nature, flourish all the more.

*Release Text*: *"Then Strong"* (则壮) – Li [Fan] says: *"Strong"* (壮) is akin to *"swift."* *"Then Lazy"* (则惰) is pronounced *tú wò*.

【一三】【Annotation】 When things attain what they crave, joy follows. *Release Text*: *"What They Crave"* (所耆) is pronounced *shí zhì*; *"and Joy"* (而乐) is pronounced *luò*.

【一四】【Exegesis】 *"Excess"* (尤) means *"exceedingly."* Greedy competitors must amass wealth to satisfy their desires; arrogant boasters rely on power to indulge their hearts. If their pursuits contradict their nature, sorrow and grief inevitably arise.

「◎ *Regretfully omitted* [Regretfully omitted] *Qing Fan’s* annotated selection of Jia Longsha’s [*Péng*] [*Fú*] Bird *Fu* and Ruan Xizong’s *Caoyou* Poems, both citing Sima [Xiangru]: *"Qua"* (夸) means *"empty reputation."* *Release Text*: [Omitted].

【一五】【Annotation】 Power and influence arise from shifting circumstances.
【Counsel】 When calamity strikes, power and influence grow even greater—thus, those who rely on power to oppress others delight in turmoil.

【一六】【Annotation】 All these scholars have their uses, but their efficacy depends on the times. When the times demand it, they cannot help but act. If they fail to meet the times, even if they wish to exert themselves, how could they succeed? Thus, nobility and lowliness are not fixed.
【Counsel】 The scholars mentioned earlier, when they encountered the right moment, adapted their nature to circumstances—thus, they could not refrain from action.

【一七】【Annotation】 A scholar’s abilities have their limits, like the four seasons, which cannot be altered. When things align with their proper order, each has its use. Thus, following the seasons brings order, while defying nature brings ruin—ruin without cause is sheer destruction.
【Counsel】 *[This]* [Compare] [to the] four seasons—order in sequence. A scholar’s actions have strengths and weaknesses; their rise and fall follow the times, like the changing warmth and cold of the seasons, unchanging in their nature. *"Not defying"* [nature] means they cannot be altered by external forces.

【一八】【Annotation】 Those who do not confine themselves to one skill but roam the world to seize opportunities often return in humiliation—this is cause for sorrow.
【Counsel】 Exhausting body and mind, lurking in the world ahead, until death comes, yet they do not return—how foolish and pitiable! Truly, this is worthy of lamentation.

◎ *Family lineage*: My father said: *"Those bound by things* [物] *are tools for practical use, their power originating from within; the times provide opportunity, the means for action, arising from without. Nature has its dependencies, talent its biases—inner and outer forces combine to form ability, yet their interplay never ceases."*

*Release Text*: *"To seize"* (以要) – *yáo* (遥反). *"Crawl"* (匍) – *fú* (扶), also *pú* (蒲). *"Creep"* (匐) – *fú* (服), also *púběi* (蒲北反).

*Zhuangzi* says: *"If an archer does not aim but still hits the mark, calling him a skilled archer would make all under heaven* [Yi]—is that acceptable?*
【一】【Annotation】 Hitting without aiming refers to a random hit, not true skill. If such randomness were called skill, then all under heaven could be called* [Yi]—is that acceptable? It is not.
【Counsel】 *"Aim"* means aligning with the target. If an archer shoots without aiming and randomly hits, calling him skilled—is that acceptable?

*Huizi* says: *"Acceptable."*

*Zhuangzi* says: *"The world does not have a single correct view, yet each holds what they deem true—if all under heaven were* [Yao]—is that acceptable?*
【一】【Annotation】 If random hits are called skill, then those who privately affirm their own views could be called* [Yao]. Zhuangzi uses this to show that random hits are not true skill, nor are self-affirming views true* [Yao].
【Counsel】 Each clings to their own truth, so there is no universal truth. Yet Tang Yao, the sage, deemed what was right in opposition to Jie. If each holds their own truth, then all are sages—is that acceptable? It is not.

*Huizi* says: *"Acceptable."*

*Zhuangzi* says: *"Then the Ruists, Mohists, Yangists, and Jingists—four schools—along with Confucius, make five. Which of them is truly correct? Perhaps someone like* [Lu Ju]?
His disciple said: *'I have grasped my master’s Dao! I can cook rice in winter and make ice in summer!'*
*Lu Ju* said: *'This is merely calling heat with heat and cold with cold—this is not what I call the Dao. Let me show you my Dao.'*
Then he tuned his zither, placing one string in the hall and one in the chamber. When he struck the *gong* pitch, the *gong* strings resonated; when he struck the *jue* pitch, the *jue* strings resonated—the tones harmonized.
If one altered a single string’s tuning, it would clash with the five tones—yet when struck, all twenty-five strings vibrated, yet without discord, and the master of sound emerged.
Is this the case? Or what?"*

「【一】If all were like Yao, why would the Five Schools still dispute each other?【二】
*Rú* (儒), of the *Zhèng* (郑) clan, was named *Huǎn* (缓).
*Mò* (墨) was named *Zhái* (翟).
*Yáng* (杨) was named *Zhū* (朱).
*Pǐng* (秉) was the given name of *Gōngsūn Lóng* (公孙龙).
These four scholars—all renowned for their brilliance, surpassing others in wisdom, and masterful in debate—along with *Huì* (惠), made five. Each claimed their own perspective as correct, yet none could definitively prove whose was the true *Dao/Way*. If all under heaven were like Yao, why would these five still dispute each other?

【释文】*Fù yòu fǎn* (《复相》).

【二】*Rú Jù* (鲁遽), of the *Lǔ* (鲁) clan, was named *Jù* (遽), a person from the early Zhou dynasty.
He said that in winter, one could gather dry ashes from a thousand-year-old fire and wrap them around a flame, which would emerge in an instant and allow for cooking the *dǐng* (鼎). In summer, one could fill an earthenware jar with water, boil it, then suspend the jar in a well, and within moments, it would freeze into ice.
Yet the confused masses, like him, only assert their own views and deny others—no different from *Rú Jù* (鲁遽).

【释文】*Rú Jù* (鲁遽), pronounced as *qú* (渠), also *qí jù* (其据)反.
*Lǐ Yún* (李云): *Rú Jù* (鲁遽) is a personal name.
It is also said: a person from the early Zhou dynasty.
*Fàn* (《爨》), pronounced as *qī luàn* (七乱)反 or *qī duān* (七端)反.

【三】The thousand-year-old ashes are *yáng* (阳, "solar/active qi"), and fire is also *yáng*—this is calling *yáng* with *yáng*.
The well is *yīn* (阴, "lunar/passive qi"), and water is also *yīn*—this is calling *yīn* with *yīn*.
Thus, *Rú Jù*’s words were not those of his disciple.

【四】*Qǐ* (俱) also asserts *yáng* with *yáng*, yet claims his own view as correct.

【释文】*Wéi zhī* (《为之》), pronounced as *yú wěi* (于伪)反.
*Fèi yī* (《废一》): *Fèi* (废) means "to place."
*Qǐ* (俱) also asserts *yáng* with *yáng*, yet claims his own view as correct.

【五】If one alters the tuning of a single string in the hall, the strings indoors would no longer resonate in harmony—this is because the *lǜ* (律, "pitches") differ.
When one changes the tuning of a string, the twenty-five strings all vibrate—this is because the adjustment is made through *jí huǎn* (急缓, "tension/relaxation").

【释文】*Gǎi diào* (《改调》), pronounced as *tú diào* (徒吊)反.
*Annotations* (注) are all the same.
*Wú dàng* (《无当》), pronounced as *dīng làng* (丁浪)反, meaning "to harmonize."

【六】Without sound, there is no means to resonate; with sound, only the same pitch would respond.
Now, if one alters this single string and all twenty-five strings vibrate in response, it is because the adjustment relies on tension and relaxation.

【七】*Rú Jù* (鲁遽) boasted of this to his disciple, yet even so, he merely relied on the same pitch responding to the same pitch—this was not uniquely his own skill.
Beyond the harmony of pitch, what other strange techniques exist?
Though their resonance differs, they all ultimately take the Five Tones as their sovereign.
Since there are no other techniques, why should he boast?

【八】The Five Schools each uphold their private views as correct, yet this is no different from *Rú Jù*’s disciple boasting of his own abilities—none can truly distinguish themselves.

*Huì Zǐ* (惠子) said: *“Now, the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and *Pǐng* (秉)ists are debating with me, using words to contradict each other and voices to suppress one another. Yet none of them can definitively prove me wrong—then what is the difference? ”*

【释文】*Xiāng fú* (《相拂》), pronounced as *fú fú* (扶弗)反.

*Zhuāng Zǐ* (庄子) said: *“The people of Qi who abandoned their child in Song—when they entrusted him to the doorkeeper, they did not ensure his safety; when they sought the *lín* (林, "small bell") *zhōng* (钟, "bell"), they bound it with ropes for fear of damage; and when they sought the *Táng* (唐, "lost") child, they never left their own borders, yet still claimed to have left descendants.
Now, the people of Chu who abandoned the doorkeeper—midnight, when no one was around, they fought with the boatman. Yet they never truly departed from the *cén* (岑, "hill") and were still capable of incurring resentment.”*

【释文】*Xiāng fú* (《相拂》), pronounced as *fú fú* (扶弗)反.

【一】They abandoned him in a foreign land and commanded the doorkeeper to guard him, but his body was not preserved intact.
This reflects the cruelty of the people of Qi, yet they still considered themselves righteous, hence their actions.

*Cén* (《蹢》), pronounced as *chéng yì* (呈亦)反, meaning "to abandon."
*Sīmǎ Yún* (司马云): The people of Qi hated their child and abandoned him in Song, entrusting him to the doorkeeper, causing his body to be incomplete, yet they still considered themselves righteous.

【二】They instead claimed that their love for the bell was correct, binding it with ropes for fear of its breaking or injury.
This reflects their devaluation of their child for the sake of the bell, yet they still considered themselves righteous.

【释文】*Lín zhōng* (《钘锺》), pronounced as *jīng* (刑) or *xú hù tíng* (徐户挺)反.
*Lín* (林), as noted by *Xǔ Hù* (徐户), resembles a small bell with a long neck.
It is also said: it resembles a jar but is larger.
*Yǐ shù fú* (《以束缚》): *Guō Yún* (郭云) says it means "to fear its breaking or injury."
This case demonstrates their contempt for their child while valuing the bell, yet they still considered themselves righteous.

【三】*Táng* (唐) means "lost."
They lost their child yet could not search beyond their own borders, leaving behind his *qì lèi* (气类, "essence/lineage"), yet still they never considered themselves wrong.
The absurdity of people’s self-righteousness is evident here.

【疏】*Lín* (钘) is a small bell.
*Táng* (唐) means "lost."
They searched for their lost child yet never left their own borders;
they bound the small bell with ropes for fear of its damage;
they devalued their child while cherishing the bell—this was their cruelty, yet they still claimed to be righteous, leaving behind his essence/lineage, and said, ‘This is my doing.’”

「◎ *Yú Yè* (俞樾) said: "There is one who abandoned his lineage,"—this should be read as a connected clause with the preceding *fú* (夫).

"There is one who abandoned his lineage," *fú* (夫), parallels the structure in *Zhuàn* (左传) of the 24th year of *Xiāng* (襄), where it reads: "There is one with virtue," *fú* (夫); "There is one with fame," *fú* (夫). Here, *lèi* (类) refers to "kind/lineage."

The *Shī* (诗) passage *"Chángcháng zhě"* (裳裳者) interprets this as the case of *Huá Xù* (华序) abandoning the virtuous—*zhèngyì* (正义) explains: "Here, *lèi* (类) means kind/lineage." This is correct.

If one searches for a lost child yet never leaves his own borders, then that lost child cannot be found, and there must be one who abandoned his lineage—thus the saying, *"There is one who abandoned his lineage," fú* (夫), is a rhetorical inversion to make this clear. *Guō Zhù* (郭注) misread the word *táng* (唐), and his interpretation is incorrect.

【*Shìwén* (释文)】 *"Táng zǐ"* (唐子) refers to the lost child.
*"Yí lèi"* (遗类) means "abandoned," *yí* (遗) here meaning "lost," as he abandoned his lineage.

*Huì Shī* (惠施) abandoned the *Dào* (道) yet loved to argue, just as the people of *Qí* (齐) abandoned their child yet cherished the bell.
*"Yuǎn suǒ"* (远索) should be read as *"suǒ yuǎn"* (所百反).

【*Sì* (四)】【*Zhù* (注)】 They all lodged in others' homes yet could not cast themselves into highlands.

【*Wǔ* (五)】【*Zhù* (注)】 *Chén* (岑), meaning "bank/shore." In the dead of night, alone boarding a stranger's ship, he had not yet left the shore when he already fought with the boatmen.

The conduct of these two men from *Qí* (齐) and *Chǔ* (楚) was such, yet they never admitted their wrongdoing. Now, the five scholars claim righteousness—how different is this from them?

【*Cí* (疏)】 The people of *Yǐng* (郢) in *Chǔ* (楚), because their children were guests lodging nearby the riverside, threw stones at the doorkeepers of the wealthy households.

In the dead of night, when there was no one about, they would enter others' boats, yet before the ships had even left the shore, they were already fighting with the boatmen. They harbored no gratitude nor virtue, instead fabricating grievances, their folly and vulgarity reaching such extremes that they still claimed, "This is my doing."

The disciples of *Huìzǐ* (惠子) were of this kind.

*Chén* (岑) means "bank/shore." ◎ *Yú Yè* (俞樾) said: "Examining the clause ‘*fú* (夫) the people of *Chǔ* (楚) lodged while the doorkeepers were stoned,’ the *fú* (夫) should belong to the preceding ‘*There is one who abandoned his lineage,* fú’ (有遗类矣夫). ‘*Tì* (蹢)’ should be read as *zhuì* (谪)."

*Yáng Xióng* (扬雄) in *Fāngyán* (方言): *zhuì* (谪) means "anger."
*Zhāng Yí* (张揖) in *Guǎngyǎ* (广雅) explains: *zhuì* (谪) means "to reproach."

The people of *Chǔ* (楚) lodged while they reproached the doorkeepers, meaning they stayed in others' homes yet angrily blamed their doorkeepers. This aligns with the following passage, where in the dead of night, when there was no one about, they fought with the boatmen—all these are the deeds of the people of *Chǔ* (楚), illustrating their self-righteousness.

*Guō Zhù* (郭注) said: "They all lodged in others' homes yet could not cast themselves into highlands"—this interpretation is utterly inconsistent with the meaning.

【*Shìwén* (释文)】 *"Ér yǔ zhōurén dòu"* (而与舟人斗) — *Sīmǎ* (司马) said: "In the dead of night, boarding others' ships, the boatmen would surely push them into the water." *Jiǎn* (挤) means "to push."

◎ *Jiāshì Fù* (家世父) said: "The *Shuōwén* (说文) defines *tì* (蹢) as ‘to stop one's foot.’ In the *Yì* (易) passage, ‘*yíng zhì fú tì zhú* (羸豕孚蹢躅),’ the *Zǎijì* (载记) of the third year asks, ‘*wèn tì zhú yǎn* (问蹢躅焉),’ and the *Shìwén* (释文) explains: *tì zhú* (蹢躅) means ‘to be unable to walk.’ The doorkeepers guarded the gates, and if one could not walk properly, they would be ordered to stop him. *Yì chéng* (趼锺), should be read as *yì zhǒng* (趼踵), as in the *Tiāndào piān* (天道篇) passage: ‘*bǎi shě zhòng yì ér bù gǎn xī* (百舍重趼而不敢息).’"

The *Shuōwén* (说文) defines *zhǒng* (踵) as "to pursue," or alternatively, "the appearance of going and coming." *Shùfù* (束缚) means "to bind with ropes."

He was ordered to stop by the doorkeepers, so his feet did not need to be bound; yet when he hurriedly pursued the bell, his feet were bound, and this was an additional restriction. The *Ěryǎ* (尔雅) explains palace terms: "Paths inside the temple are called *táng* (唐), paths in the hallways are called *chén* (陈)." The *Máoshī* (毛诗) passage of *Chénfēng* (陈风) explains: *táng* (唐) means "hallway paths."

In the *Tiánzǐ Fāng piān* (田子方篇), it is said: "He sought horses in the *tángsì* (唐肆)," and *Sīmǎ* (司马) also said: *tángsì* (唐肆) means "broad courtyard." *Tángzǐ* (唐子), like *Ménzǐ* (门子) in the *Zhōulǐ* (周礼), refers to those who give orders.

If one never left his own borders yet abandoned his lineage, it implies his lineage was numerous. Doorkeepers assessed his abilities, runners measured his endurance, and attendants in the hallways served all—yet each claimed righteousness and self-sufficiency, without necessarily excelling beyond others.

Their mutual accusations were even more absurd, as they failed to examine the truth and instead sought victory through their own assumptions.

The people of *Chǔ* (楚) lodged in others' homes while they reproached their doorkeepers—this was the duty of the doorkeepers. The *Shuōwén* (说文) states: "Doorkeepers are commonly assigned to close the gates at dusk."

How could one, in the dead of night, in a place with no one about, fight with the boatmen? They assumed that a place with no one about meant there was no one at all; they assumed that fighting with the boatmen meant they were fully engaged in combat—yet the fabricators of grievances are endless, while they themselves have never truly left the shore.

The people of *Qí* (齐) toward those of *Sòng* (宋), and the people of *Chǔ* (楚) lodging as guests, were not of the same lineage nor accustomed to each other, so without cause they fabricated grievances—yet they could still fight with the boatmen in the dead of night.

Those who claim righteousness do not know why they are righteous;
those who condemn do not know why they condemn.»

The old annotations stray too far from the text.

The *Qí* (齐) man smeared white clay upon his guest’s nose tip like a gnat’s wing, and bade the craftsman *Jiàngshí* (匠石) carve it. *Jiàngshí* wielded his axe with such skill that it whistled through the air—yet he carved it blindly, with his eyes closed, and the clay was all removed while the nose remained unharmed. The *Qí* man stood upright, his composure never shaken.

The Prince of *Sòng* (宋) heard of this and summoned *Jiàngshí*, saying, “Try it for me.” *Jiàngshí* replied, “I could indeed carve it. But alas, my own Dao/Way has long since perished.”

Since the death of my Master, I have no Dao/Way to serve as my standard, nor anyone with whom I can converse.

The *Qí* man removed the white clay while the nose remained unharmed, and stood upright, his composure never lost.

The Prince of *Sòng* (宋) heard of his marvelous skill and once summoned *Jiàngshí* to attempt it himself.

**【释文】** *For "Guǎrén"* (寡人), read *yú* (于) as *wěi* (惠) in the *Pseudoreading*.

**【注】** It is not the Dao/Way of one who is inherently unperturbed, nor the art of one who can converse without words, that would have no use in this case—even with the most exquisite words and skillful carving.

**【疏】** *Zhì* (质) means "unperturbed composure." Though *Jiàngshí* was skilled, he required the unperturbed composure of his subject; though *Zhuāngzi* (庄子) was virtuous, he still relied on the art of conversing without words. Since the passing of *Huìzi* (惠子), *Zhuāngzi* had lost his companion, thus the craftsman ceased his masterful strokes of the axe, and *Zhuāngzi* abandoned his subtle words by the *Háo* (濠) River.

**【校】** (一) *Zhào Jiànyì* (赵谏议) reads this as *màn* (漫).
(二) The text is missing; it incorrectly cites the *Jiāngnán Gǔ Zàng* (江南古藏) edition and *Lǐ* (李) edition with the additional phrase, *"míngmù zìshǒu"* (瞑目恣手).
(三) The character *nǎi* (乃) is corrected according to the *Guǎngyùn* (广韵).

「When Guān Zhòng was gravely ill, Duke Huán asked him, "Comrade Zhòng, your illness is severe—how can I govern the state when you are gone?" Guān Zhòng replied, "With whom do you wish to entrust the state?" The Duke said, "Bào Shūyá."

Guān Zhòng said, "That is not possible. His nature is upright and scrupulous, and he does not associate with those who are not his equal. Moreover, once he hears of someone’s fault, he never forgets it. If he were to govern the state, he would soon offend the sovereign above and alienate the people below. His days in office would not be long!"

The Duke asked, "Then who is suitable?" Guān Zhòng answered, "If there is no alternative, then Yì Péng may be entrusted. His character is such that, though he holds himself aloft, he does not act haughty, and while he feels shame for those who do not surpass him, he pities those who do not equal him. The sage divides people by virtue, and the worthy by wealth. To govern by virtue alone without wealth is to fail in winning the people’s hearts; to govern by virtue while also yielding wealth to them is to never fail in winning the people’s hearts. In his governance of the state, he does not hear of trivial matters, and in his management of the household, he does not see minor faults. If there is no alternative, then Yì Péng may be entrusted."

King Fú of Wú floated upon the river, ascending the **Qǔ** (狙) Mountain. The **Qǔ** (狙) apes saw him and, in terror, abandoned their perches and fled into the dense thickets. But one old **Qǔ** ape remained, leisurely grooming its claws, and then, with a display of cleverness, approached the king. The king shot at it, but the ape was swift and agile, dodging the arrows with ease. The king then ordered his archer to shoot, and the ape seized the dead body of the arrow. The archer took aim and shot again, and the ape grasped the arrow once more. The king commanded his retainer to shoot, and the ape held the dead body of the arrow.

---
**【注】** (一) *Sensitivity and quickness.* *Give* means *to follow up and secure.*
**【疏】** The **Qǔ** (狙) are **Jū** (狝) monkeys. Since the mountain abounds with them, it is called **Qǔ** Mountain. *Sensitivity* (恂) means *fear and alarm.* *Thickets* (蓁) are clusters of thorny bushes. *Leisurely* (委蛇) means *composed and unhurried.* *Grooming its claws* (攫搔) is a correction—originally *虫* (insect), but should be *爪* (claws). The term *敏给* (敏给) means *swift and nimble.* King Fú of Wú floated upon the river, gazing about in leisure, while the **Jū** (狝) monkeys fled in fear into the deep thickets. Only one old **Qǔ** ape, relying on its agility, approached the king. The king, astonished and angry, quickly shot at it, but the ape was too agile to be hit. The king then ordered his archer to shoot, and the ape caught the arrow mid-flight. The retainer shot again, and the ape seized the arrow once more.

The **Qǔ** ape’s claw was originally written as *搔* (scratch), pronounced *sù-bào* (素报反). Xu’s version reads *□* (with *qī-huó* 七活反), while Sima Qian’s text uses *tiáo* (条). *Jiàn* (见) is pronounced *xián-biàn* (贤遍反). *Qiǎo* (巧) is read as *qiǎo* (如字), though some pronounce it *kǔ-xiào* (苦孝反); Cui’s version uses *gōng* (攻). *Wáng shè* (王射) is pronounced *shí-yì* (食亦反). The same pronunciation applies below.

---
**Commentary:**
*"Jié"* (捷) means *swift*. Though the arrows flew swiftly, the ape could still *bó* (搏) them.

**Exegesis:**
*"Bó"* (搏) means *to intercept*. *"Jié"* (捷) means *swift*. *"Shǐ"* (矢) refers to *arrows*. Though arrows fly swiftly, the ape intercepted each one—its agility was such.

**Textual Notes:**
*"Bó"* (搏) is pronounced *bó* (博). Yu Yüeh (俞樾) notes: In Guo’s annotation beneath *"mǐn-gěi"* (敏给), he defines *"gěi"* (给) as *"continuously grasping"* (续括). Yet this seems misplaced, as *"mǐn-gěi"* are synonyms—*The Book of Han*’s Li Xian’s commentary on *Lü Yan*’s *"gěi-jié"* (给捷) states *"gěi"* means *"mǐn"* (敏). The *Guoyu* and *Xing E* chapter of *Xunzi* also pair *"mǐn-gěi"* as synonyms. Thus, Guo’s interpretation diverges from ancient usage. *"Mǐn-gěi"* should describe the ape’s nature: *its swift agility, intercepting arrows with its hands*. *"Jié"* (捷) here aligns with *"jiē"* (接)—*Erya* equates *"jiē"* (接) with *"jié"* (捷). In *Zuozhuan* (Zhuang 12, Xi 32, Wen 16), *"jié"* is used interchangeably with *"jiē"* (接). Thus, *"bó-jié shǐ"* (搏捷矢) means *to intercept arrows with its hands*. Guo’s claim that *"jié"* means *"swift"* is redundant—arrows are inherently swift.

---
**Exegesis:**
*"Mìng"* (命) means *to summon*. *"Xiàng"* (相) means *to assist*—referring to the king’s attendants. Having failed to strike the ape himself, the king summoned his retinue to shoot in haste. The ape then clung to a tree and died.

**Textual Notes:**
*"Xiàng zhě"* (相者) is pronounced *xī-liàng* (息亮反). Sima Qian explains: *"Those who assist the king in hunting."* *"Qū shè"* (趋射) is pronounced *cù* (促), meaning *urgent*. *"Shì sǐ"* (执死) is explained by Sima Qian as *"dying after being seized."*

**Collations:**
(1) *Shìdétáng*’s version uses *zhuā* (抓).
(2) The *jǎ* (假) character is corrected per *Shìdétáng*.
(3) *"Néng bó"* (能搏) is amended per *Shìdétáng*.

The king turned to his friend, Yan Buyi, and said:
*"That ape, relying on its cunning and agility, dared to defy me—thus meeting its doom! Beware! Alas, let not your beauty ever make you arrogant toward others!"*

Yan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to refine his appearance, abandoning music and ostentation. After three years, the people praised him.

---
**Exegesis:**
Yan Buyi, surnamed Yan, styled *Buyi*, was the king’s friend. *"Zhì"* (殛) means *to die*. *"Yú"* (予) refers to *myself*.

The ape boasted of its strength and cunning, relied on its agility and ease, and acted arrogantly toward the king, thus meeting its doom. Alas, this cunning beast serves as a warning: do not indulge in sensual pleasures or display haughtiness in the world.

◎*Qìng Fān* notes: *Nan Guozi Qi* is also referred to as *Nan Guozi Qi* in *Qiwùlùn* (齐物论). The ancient sounds of *bó* (伯) and *guō* (郭) were close, so their characters are interchangeably used. According to the *Tángyùn* (唐韵), *bó* (伯) was pronounced like *bó* (博) in ancient times. The *Zhōulǐ* (周礼) used *bó* (柏) for *qì* (几) in seating arrangements, borrowing *bó* (柏) for *guō* (椁).

Could your body truly be made as lifeless as a withered corpse (槁骸),

Their **future grows ever more distant** (日远)!"」

**Commentary:**
The *Shān Xué zhī Zhōng* refers to the **Southern Mountain Cave of Qí**. *Tián Hé* was the personal name of the **Qí monarch**. When **Zǐ Qí** secluded himself in the mountain cave, his **virtue and renown spread far**, and when the Qí king caught a glimpse of him, the people took it as an honor, hence the threefold rejoicing of the entire state.

**Textual Notes:**
The *Shān Xué zhī Zhōng* passage matches the **Sīmǎ edition**. **Lí Yún** states: "It is the southern mountain cave of Qí." One variant reads *zhī kǒu* (之口). *Tián Hé* refers to the **Qí ruler**, and since he **revered virtue**, the people celebrated him. **Lú Wénpián** suggests this is **Qí Tàigōng Hé**.

---

**Commentary:**
My **reputation precedes me**, so others recognize me; I am the **merchandise being sold**, hence *Tián Hé* sees and trades me.

**Textual Notes:**
*"Yù zhī"* (鬻之) is pronounced *yàng liù* (羊六反).

---

**Commentary:**
If I **conceal my light and obscure my traces**, with no reputation to proclaim, how could the world know of me? If my **name lacks value**, how could they see and trade me? It is only because I cannot **erase my presence or hide my essence** that I become the object of their buying and selling.

**Textual Notes:**
*"Bǐ wū"* (彼恶) is pronounced *wū* (乌). The same below.

**Commentary:**
*"Sàng"* (丧) means **loss or ruin**. **Zǐ Qí** laments those who **abandon themselves**, chasing others while losing their **Dao**.

**Textual Notes:**
*"Zì sàng"* (自丧) is pronounced *xī làng* (息浪反).

---

**Commentary:**
The **Dao** knows no gain or loss, yet beings experience sorrow and joy. Thus, those who lament their own ruin are also worthy of pity.

---

**Annotation:**
**Zǐ Qí** knew that **acting to save others** would only harm himself, so by **not pitying their pity**, their sorrow lessens, and he attains **tranquil indifference**, his form withering—thus his **distance grows daily**.

**Commentary:**
The **mysterious Dao** is **empty and boundless**, knowing neither ruin nor joy. Therefore, though **Zǐ Qí’s** successive lamentations vary in depth—whether for those who ruin themselves or those who pity them—none align with the Dao, making them all objects of pity. **Pitying again and again**, yet **releasing each time**, the teaching becomes clear, and the **profoundest principles** emerge, harmonizing with all wonders—thus the sorrow deepens and recedes ever farther.

Additionally, in the **12th year of Duke Xuān** (宣十二年), the *Zhuàn* (左传) records that **Yíliáo** (宜僚) was the prime minister of **Xióng** (熊), a distant ancestor of the **Chǔ** (楚), making him contemporary with **Sūn Chú Ào** (孙叔敖) but far removed from **Confucius**’s time.

*"The words of antiquity must be spoken at a proper occasion."* **[1]**

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Cháng* (觞) is the general term for wine vessels, meaning to entertain with wine. *Jué* (爵) is also a wine vessel, holding one *shēng* (升) of wine. **[2]**
When a man of antiquity desired to drink, he would first offer a libation to his ancestors. **Shì Nán Yíliáo** (市南宜僚) poured the wine as a libation, thus honoring the **sages** (圣人), and wishing to engage in discourse with **Confucius** here.

**Textual Notes:**
*"Cháng zhī"* (觞之) is pronounced *shāng* (商).
**Li Yún** (李云) says: *"It is the general term for wine vessels."*

**Case Analysis:**
In the *Zhuàn* (左传), **Sūn Chú Ào** (孙叔敖) was the prime minister of **King Zhuāng of Chǔ** (楚庄王), while **Confucius** (孔子) had not yet been born. The mention of **Sūn Chú Ào** (孙叔敖) here is likely an allegorical reference.

**Confucius** said: *"I have heard of **unspeakable speech** (不言之言), yet I have never spoken of it before—now I speak of it here."* **[3]**
**Shì Nán Yíliáo** (市南宜僚) toyed with a ball to resolve the feud between the **Zhōu** (周) and **Chǔ** (楚) families, while **Sūn Chú Ào** (孙叔敖) lay down with a feather fan, allowing the **Yǐng people** (郢人) to abandon their weapons. **[4]**
I wish I had a mouth three *cùn* (寸) long!" **[5]**

「【1】**Note:** The sage does not speak; what he does speak of is merely the speech of the common people, hence the term *"unspeakable speech"* (不言之言). If one considers speech as *"unspeakable"*, then even when words issue from the mouth, they are still deemed as *"never having spoken"* (未之尝言).

【2】**Note:** Now I speak of the *"unspeakable"* (无言) here.

**Exegesis:** The principles of governance and instruction are inherently *"unspeakable"* (不言), yet instruction and governance are what the sage has never explicitly spoken of (未之尝言). Thus, the sage subtly embodies this profound essence, so that throughout the day he speaks yet never truly speaks (终日言而未尝言). **Confucius**, responding to **Shì Nán Yíliáo**’s request, thus also speaks of the *"unspeakable"* here.

【3】**Note:** These two men resolved disputes through silence (息讼以默), maintaining an unruffled composure, and thus the conflicts and military threats naturally dissipated.

**Exegesis:** Surname **Xióng** (熊), given name **Yíliáo** (宜僚), he was a virtuous man of **Chǔ** (楚) and also a courageous warrior who was skilled in subduing (沈) or vanquishing (没) through silence (默). Dwelling in **Shì Nán** (市南), he was thus called **Shì Nán Zǐ** (市南子). When **Bái Gōng Shèng** (白公胜) plotted rebellion, intending to slay the Minister of Works **Zǐ Xī** (子西), the military officer **Sīmǎ Zǐ Qí** (司马子綦) reported to him that **Xióng Yíliáo** (熊宜) was a brave warrior, capable of defeating five hundred men if captured. Thus, he dispatched envoys to entrap him.

**Shì Nán Yíliáo** (市南宜僚) was leisurely rolling a ball between his hands, unperturbed by the envoys’ presence. The envoys, seizing the opportunity, drew their swords to strike him, yet **Yíliáo** (宜僚) showed no fear. Neither did he comply with their demands nor utter a word in protest. Unable to capture **Yíliáo** (宜僚), **Bái Gōng** (白公)’s rebellion faltered, failing to materialize—hence the phrase *"the feud between the two families remained unresolved"* (两家之难解).

Surname **Sūn** (孙), given name **Chú Ào** (叔敖), he was the Minister of Works (令尹) of **Chǔ** (楚), renowned for his virtue and power (德). **Yǐng** (郢) was the capital of **Chǔ** (楚). *"Invest"* (投) here means *"to lay down"* (息). **Sūn Chú Ào** (孙叔敖), though deeply knowledgeable and wise, reclined with high ease, embracing the Dao (逍遥), so profound in his understanding that he transcended the need for words (会理忘言). Holding a feather fan, he found contentment within himself (秉羽而自得), thereby preventing enemy incursions, deflecting conflicts from afar (折冲千里之外), ensuring the people of **Chǔ** (楚) lived in peace, cultivating the **virtue/power** (文德) of the land, and diminishing its martial ambitions (息其武略).

Given these two men’s extraordinary abilities, they could converse with **Zhòngní** (仲尼, Confucius) and be praised for their mastery of the profound Dao (玄道).」

The *Jié* (解) is pronounced *xiè* (蟹), with the same annotation as before.

According to **Sīmǎ** (司马), **Yíliáo** (宜僚) was a valiant warrior of **Chǔ** (楚), skilled in ball-playing. When **Bái Gōng Shèng** (白公胜) plotted rebellion and assassinated the **Língyìn** (令尹) **Zǐxī** (子西), **Zǐqī Shíqǐ** (子期石乞) said, *"There is a bear-like warrior named Yíliáo in the market; if we secure him, he could stand against five hundred men."* He went to recruit him, but Yíliáo refused. Pressed with a sword, he remained unmoved, continuing his ball-play as usual, saying, *"I will not betray you either."* Bái Gōng then killed Zǐxī. Zǐqī sighed, and the conflict between the two factions (two families) was resolved, yet Yíliáo was not involved in the strife.

**Regulation Notes:**
- *Gānqǐn Bǐngyǔ* (甘寝秉羽) is read as-is, with *yǔ* (羽) pronounced *hé* (翮), or alternatively *chì* (翅), the fan held by dancers in *yúwǔ* (雩舞). **Cuī** (崔) reads it as *yì* (翼).
- On *Yǐngrén Tóubīng* (郢人投兵), **Sīmǎ** (司马) explains: *"It means Sūn Chú Ào (孙叔敖) wished to rest peacefully and cultivate virtue within the ancestral temple, resolving conflicts from afar, so that enemy states dared not invade. Thus, the people of Yǐng (郢) laid down their arms, with no wars to wage."* Yǐng (郢) was the capital of **Chǔ** (楚).

---
**Regulation Notes (Further):**
- The *Tàipíng Yùlǎn* (太平御览) cites **Sīmǎ** (司马): *"Yíliáo was skilled in ball-playing; when Bái Gōng (白公) coerced him, he continued playing as before."* This is more concise than the *Shìwén* (释文).
- The *Húinán Zhǔshù* (淮南主术篇) states: *"In ancient times, Sūn Chú Ào (孙叔敖) lay in tranquil repose, and the people of Yǐng (郢) suffered no harm from his blade."* The term *tóubīng* (投兵) means *"no use of arms."* **Gāo** (高) comments: *"He merely rested peacefully to cultivate virtue, resolving conflicts from afar, so enemy states dared not invade."* This aligns with **Sīmǎ**’s annotation. **Wáng Niànsūn** (王念孙) corrects *"harm"* (害) to *"use"* (用), explaining that *"without using his blade"* was intended. The character *hài* (害) in cursive resembles *yòng* (用), and the *Húinán* often draws from *Zhuāngzǐ*. Thus, *tóubīng* also means *"no use."*

---
**On the Three-Inch Blade (Sānchǐ 三尺):**
If what one speaks is not one’s own, then even if one speaks all one’s life, it is as though one had never spoken. Thus, having a three-inch blade (喙三尺) is insufficient to be called long—ordinary people who close their mouths are no less silent. The blade refers to a dagger or short sword.

15. Virtue/power (德) arises from nature (性), not from words.

16. A dog need not bark to be a good dog; a sage need not speak much to be virtuous—how much less to attain greatness!

17. The greater the greatness, the less it can be claimed as one’s own achievement.

18. Heaven and Earth are fully complete in their greatness, yet they do not seek it.

19. The one who knows this self-sufficiency does not abandon self to seek things, thus there is no seeking, losing, or discarding.

20. Returning to the self, one finds harmony with the Dao/Way—this is the natural resonance of the Great Person.

21. Greatness comes from following one’s innate nature without strain, not from contrivance.

22. To follow the nature of things without effort, to align with the Dao/Way without artifice—this is the Way of antiquity, which endures without fading. Though its principles are eternal, its name is not erased across time. The Great Person’s virtue/power (德) lies in realizing the Dao/Way without artificial means, hence it is called *sincerity* (诚).」

「【Commentary】 *Sincerity* (诚), here means *reality* or *authenticity*.

To return to the origin and align with the natural course of all things—this is the Great Sage’s virtue/power (德) realized through genuine selfhood.

【Collation Note】 (1) Zhao Jianyi’s text has the character *yě* (也) after *xiōng* (凶).

Child Qi had eight sons, whom he arrayed before him and summoned Jiufang Xuan, saying: *“Examine my sons for me—who among them is auspicious?”*

【Commentary】 Child Qi was the Chu official Ziqi. *Chen* (陈) means to arrange in ranks. *Zhū* (诸) means “at.” Jiufang (九方) was a surname; Xuan (歅) was his name. *Shú* (孰) means “who.” *Xiáng* (祥) means “good fortune.” Jiufang Xuan was a master of divination.

He displayed the eight sons in the courtyard and commanded Jiufang Xuan to inspect them, asking which among them was most fortunate.

【Textual Notes】 *Jiufang Xuan* (九方歅) is pronounced *yīn* (因), as in *Li Wūjī* (李乌鸡) rhyme, or *yān* (烟), referring to a skilled horse-diviner. The *Huainanzi* records him as Jiufang Gao (九方皋). *“For me”* is read *wéi wǒ* (为我). *“Examine my sons”* is read *xiàng wú zǐ* (相吾子). Jiufang Xuan replied: *“Kun is auspicious.”*

【Commentary】 *Kun* (捆) was the name of one son. He said that among the eight, Kun was the most fortunate.

【Textual Notes】 *Kun* (捆) is pronounced *kùn* (困) or *kǒu* (口), the name of Ziqi’s son.

Ziqi was overjoyed and asked: *“How so?”* Jiufang Xuan replied: *“Kun will share meals with the sovereign and live out his days.”*

【Commentary】 *Qǔrán* (瞿然) describes a look of sudden delight.

Upon hearing Ziqi’s son’s auspicious fortune, he appeared suddenly delighted and inquired how this fortunate destiny was revealed.

【Textual Notes】 *Qǔrán* (瞿然) is pronounced *jìyù* (纪具), as per *Shiji* (史記). Sima Qian says: a joyful expression. Also written as *jǐng* (矍), pronounced *xūfú* (吁缚), meaning "wide-eyed gaze." *Zìlín* (字林) states: "a look of great observation." Li Yi (李颐) says: "a startled gaze." ◎Qìngfān* (慶藩) notes that *qǔrán* (瞿然) here and *jùrán* (惧然) in the *Gēngsāng Chǔ* (庚桑楚) passage both convey expressions of alarm. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines *qǔ* (□) as "raising one’s eyes in alarm." In the *Hànshū* (汉书), the *Jiāoxī Wáng* (胶西王) passage reads *qǔrán* (瞿然) in fright, with *Shīgǔ* (师古) annotating: "a look of losing composure." In the *Zōuyáng* (邹阳) passage, *chángjūn* (长君) *jùrán* (惧然) says, "What will become of me?" *Shīgǔ* (师古) annotates: "Read *jù* (惧) as *qǔ* (瞿); *qǔrán* (瞿然) means losing composure." In the *Dōngfāng Shuò* (东方朔) passage, *Wú Wáng* (吴王) *jùrán* (惧然) changes his expression, with *Shīgǔ* (师古) noting: "a look of losing composure." *Qìngfān* (慶藩) concludes that *Shīgǔ* (师古) interprets *qǔ* (瞿) and *jù* (惧) as "losing composure," tracing this back to the *Qí Fēng Dōngfāng Wèimíng* (齐风东方未明) passage, where *kuángfū qǔqǔ* (狂夫瞿瞿) is annotated by *Máogǔn* (毛传) as "without composure." Since the *Shiji* (史記) does not clarify the subsequent words, *qǔrán* (瞿然) should follow Li Yi’s (李颐) interpretation as "startled gaze."

Ziqi’s son wept uncontrollably and said: *“Why must my son reach such an extreme fate?!”*

【Commentary】 *Suǒrán* (索然) is a look of tears streaming down.

Jiufang Xuan’s insight was shallow and superficial, for he took sharing meals with the sovereign as a sign of fortune, while Ziqi’s wisdom was profound and subtle, recognizing this as an omen of misfortune. Thus, he pitied his son’s dire fate and wept.

Jiufang Xuan said: *“When one shares meals with the sovereign, blessings extend to three generations, let alone one’s parents! Now, if the son hears this and weeps, it is as if he were warding off virtue/power. The son may be fortunate, but the father is not.”*

【Textual Notes】 *Yùfú* (御福) is pronounced *yúlù* (鱼吕), meaning "to repel" or "to resist."

Ziqi said: *“Xuan, how can you presume to understand this, and say that Kun is fortunate? Such blessings are fully consumed in wine and meat, absorbed by nostrils and mouths—how can you truly grasp their origin? I have never sought to be a shepherd, yet my son was born in a hidden place; I have never loved farming, yet my son was born in a secluded field. If you do not blame fate, then what is the cause? My son and I have wandered together in the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth. I have shared with him the joys of Heaven, and with him the nourishments of Earth; I have not schemed with him, nor plotted with him, nor sought to make him a spectacle. I have shared with him the sincere essence of Heaven and Earth, yet never let worldly matters disrupt our harmony; I have indulged with him in the natural flow of existence, yet never in what is fitting for worldly affairs. Now, alas, he has encountered the retribution of worldly conventions! All who bear strange omens must also exhibit strange conduct—perhaps it is not our fault, but rather Heaven’s will! This is why I weep.”*

【Textual Notes】 *Yóu* (游) here is pronounced *yóu* (邀), meaning "to wander together." *Yú* (于) in *yú tiāndì* (于天地) is read as *yú* (于), indicating "in." *Suǒyí* (所宜) means "what is fitting." *Shìfù* (世俗) means "worldly conventions." *Zhuì* (罪) means "fault." *Jiāntiān* (天) is used here in its metaphysical sense.

The small witchcraft is but a fleeting fancy, its omens not distant—those who bind blessings are merely after the scent of wine and meat.

But the Dao/Way’s arts are profound, their principles here revealed: how could one know that wine and meat arise from where?

【Textual Notes】 The reason for strange omens lies in their unexpectedness. *Zāng* (牂) means "ram." *Ào* (奥) is the southwest corner (*wèi* 地), the domain of the ram; *Yǐn* (宎) is the southeast corner (*chén* 地), where the quail (*chún* 鹑) resides. Hence, it speaks of the ram and quail being born. Now, sheep require herding and nurturing, while quails depend on hunting in the fields—if one attains wealth and nobility through merit and deeds, then it is fitting. But here, blessings are bound without merit, and yet they share the same food as the sovereign—what difference is there between having sheep without herding or quails without hunting? Neither herding nor hunting, and yet strange omens appear!

【Variants】 *Wèi* (未) is read as *wèi* (未), meaning "unsettled." Some say it means "pig’s pen." *Ào* (奥) is read as *wùbào* (乌报), the southwest corner (*wèi* 地). One also says: "the ram’s domain." *Yǐn* (宎) is read as *wùdiào* (乌吊) or *xiū wùliǎo* (徐乌了), the southeast corner (*chén* 地), where quails are born, or "a hole." *Chún* (鹑) is read as *hū* (忽).

【Textual Notes】 *Yǐn* (宎) is the southeast corner, as *Yǐn* (窔) in *Ěryǎ* (尔雅) denotes. Its northeast counterpart is *Yǐng* (宧). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) states that *Yǐn* (□) is the sound of a door hinge, referring to the southeast corner of a room. *Yǐn* (窔) simply means "deep."

【Textual Notes】 *Zāng* (牂) originates from herding (*mù* 牧); *chún* (鹑) comes from hunting (*tián* 田). Sheep born without herding, quails found without hunting—suddenly appearing, swiftly arriving—this is called ill-omened. Omens are strange portents; to ride upon Heaven and Earth’s sincere essence yet meet worldly retribution is also a strange portent.

【Textual Notes】 *Suǒyǐ* (所宜) means "what is fitting."

【Textual Notes】 *Yóu* (游) at *yóu yú tiāndì* (游于天地) is read as *yóu yú mì* (游于汨), meaning "to wander in chaos." *Chuí* (崔) also reads it this way.

【Textual Notes】 *Yóu* (邀) is read as *yóu* (邀), meaning "to encounter." *Tiāndì* (天地) is "Heaven and Earth," without intention. *Zǐ Qí* (子綦) embodies the Dao/Way, empty and forgetful, aligning with nature’s flow, self-sufficient within his inherent nature, wandering freely between Heaven and Earth, all his actions in harmony, needing no forced merriment, food taken as it is met—how could he require rich flavors? *Yóu* (邀) is read as *yáo* (邀), meaning "to encounter." *Lè* (乐) is pronounced *luò* (洛).

「【Five】【Commentary】 *Guài* (怪), the unusual.

  Following what is fitting and giving free rein to one’s nature, he naturally detached himself thus.

  【【Explication】】 He forgets things, so he does not labor over them; he forgets wisdom, so he does not scheme; he follows what is fitting, so he does not act strangely.

---

【Six】【Commentary】 This is not something he does.

  【【Explication】】 *Chéng* (诚), true and real. He rides the true Dao/Way of the Two Principles (Heaven and Earth), flows with all things in effortless ease, so he does not contend with them. Thus, he does not alter or disturb them.

---

【Seven】【Commentary】 This is simply following, without choosing.

  【【Explication】】 *Wěiyí* (委蛇), akin to yielding and letting go. With no duality between mind and object, he moves with ease and lets things be. Since his actions are not truly actions, how could he seek what is fitting or proper to do?

---

【Eight】【Commentary】 If one does deeds for things, things will repay them. But I do not act for their sake and yet they repay me—why is this?

  【【Explication】】 Such repayment of deeds (or *shàng* (赏), reward) and *cháng* (偿, requite) of virtue is the concern of the mundane. If one embodies the Dao/Way and lets things be, without seeking fame or merit, why would one require repayment for deeds?

---
◎ *Lú Wénpián* (卢文弨) says: The current text has a *ér* (而) above *zhōng* (终).

  *Niè Quē* (啮缺) encountered *Xǔ Yóu* (许由), saying: “Where will you go now?【One】”

  【【Explication】】 *Niè Quē* (啮缺) met *Xǔ Yóu* (许由) and asked where he would go next.

  *Xǔ Yóu* (许由) replied: “I will flee from *Yáo* (尧).”【One】

  【【Explication】】 He answered: “I will escape from Emperor *Yáo* (尧).”

  *Niè Quē* (啮缺) said: “What do you mean?”【One】

  【【Explication】】 He asked what he intended.

(One) In a short while, the *Chǔ* (楚) envoy *Kuàn* (捆) was bound in *Yān* (燕), and a thief took him on the road, but selling him whole was difficult—it was not as easy as selling him with a mutilated foot. Thus, he mutilated his foot and sold him in *Qí* (齐), where he was bought by *Qú Gōng* (渠公) in the marketplace. His fate was to live out his days eating meat.【Two】

  【One】【Commentary】 Selling him whole risked his escape, so it was not as easy as selling him with a mutilated foot.

  【【Explication】】 *Wú jǐhé* (无几何), meaning shortly after. The *Chǔ* (楚) envoy *Kuàn* (捆), while traveling to *Yān* (燕), was seized by bandits on the road and bound as a slave. But selling him whole was feared, lest he flee, so it was difficult to defend against that. Therefore, his feet were mutilated—no fear of escape, so it was easy to sell.

---
  【【Explication】】 *Qú Gōng* (渠公), a wealthy man in *Qí* (齐) who served as the marketplace overseer. After *Kuàn* (捆) had his feet mutilated, he was sold to a wealthy merchant’s household in *Qí* (齐), where he served as the overseer’s attendant in the marketplace, eating meat for his entire life. The character *Qú* (渠) is also written as *Shú* (术). *Qú Gōng* (渠公) was a butcher, and since *Kuàn* (捆) was sold to a butcher’s household, they shared the same trade of slaughter, and *Kuàn* (捆) ate meat for his entire life.

许由 said:

“As for Emperor Yao, his benevolence was so extravagantly indulgent—*chúchú* in his kindness—that I fear he will become the laughingstock of the world. In future ages, people will even eat one another!

The people are not hard to gather—love them, and they will be devoted; benefit them, and they will come; praise them, and they will be encouraged; but if you drive them toward what they hate, they will scatter.

Love and benefit arise from virtue and righteousness, yet those who abandon virtue and righteousness are few, while those who uphold them are many. The practice of virtue and righteousness, however, is but a hollow pretense—merely a tool for the greedy and the crafty.

Thus, the decisions of one man can bring ruin to the world—like a single rotten fish spoiling the whole batch.

Yao knows how the wise benefit the world, yet he does not see how they also destroy it. Only those who stand outside the circle of the so-called ‘wise’ understand this truth.”

- *Chúchú* (畜畜): "Extravagant" or "overindulgent" (lit. "abundant, excessive").
- *Yǐn* (隐): "Eat" (as in cannibalism, a metaphor for societal collapse).

「*Its* reading follows the character. *Human cannibalism* is pronounced *yú*.

It speaks of those who would gallop off into benevolence and righteousness, abandoning agriculture entirely—when famine strikes, they will turn to eating one another.

**[II] Commentary:**
The people—if nurtured with care, they grow close; if benefited, they come willingly; if praised, they spur one another on. But if they are met with what they despise, they scatter in disarray. Thus, the masses gather or disperse with little difficulty.

**[III] Annotation:**
Once benevolence and righteousness are put into practice, they will be feigned as a pretense.

**Commentary:**
To benefit the common folk, to nurture all living beings, to establish merit and gather the people—nothing surpasses benevolence and righteousness. Yet few truly embody them from the heart, while many cling to the traces of the sages merely to gain fame and profit. Thus, those who practice benevolence and righteousness are but masking their true nature, lacking sincerity.

**[IV] Annotation:**
When benevolence and righteousness become visible, the greedy will seize upon them as tools to fulfill their ambitions.

**Commentary:**
The *qi* (instrument) refers to the traces of the sages. Those who are insatiably greedy for fame and gain, as treacherous as beasts, will inevitably use benevolence and righteousness as their tools.

**[V] Annotation:**
If benevolence and righteousness are merely outward displays of emotion, then their ruinous control will not be confined to one person.

**Commentary:**
Those who chase after honor and profit, relying on benevolence and righteousness, will indulge their poisonous schemes, bringing ruin to the world. Without the traces of the sages, how could this be?

**[VI] Annotation:**
*Yú* (覕) means to slice. All things take myriad forms, yet if one measure is used to cut them all, harm will ensue.

**Commentary:**
*Yú* (覕) means to slice. If one man seeks to dominate the world, it is like wielding a single blade to cut through all things—great harm will come to all involved.

**[VII] Annotation:**
To stand outside the circle of the "wise" is to recognize that their virtue is not genuine.

**Commentary:**
Though the traces of the sages may benefit one age, in the long run, they will breed ruin. Only those who transcend the pretense of the "wise" understand this truth.

**[Collation Notes:]**
(1) The *Shìdé Táng* edition reads *fú* (夫).
(2) The *Zhào Jiànyì* edition includes the word *yě* (也) below.

There are those who are *warm and alluring*, those who are *complacent and fleeting*, and those who are *twisted and insidious*.

**[Explanation:]**
This is a brief outline; further clarification follows below.

**Phonetic Glosses:**
- *Wǎn* (暖): *yū-wān* (吁爰反), *yū-wǎn* (吁晚反) – soft, yielding.
- *Shū* (姝): *chāng-zhū* (昌朱反) – alluring.
- *Rú* (濡): *rú* (儒), *rú* (如) – ease.
- *Xū* (需): *xū* (须) – brief repose.
- *Juǎn* (卷): *quán* (权) – twisted.
- *Lóu* (娄): *lǚ* (缕) – insidious.

「卷娄，犹拘挛也。
The *twisted and insidious* are akin to rigidity and constraint.

所谓暖姝者，学一先生之言，则暖暖姝姝而私自说也，自以为足矣，而未知未始有物也【一】，
Those who are *warm and alluring* take the words of a single master and then grow softly and enticingly pleased with themselves, deeming their own understanding sufficient—yet they do not grasp that originally, there was not a single thing to be known. Hence, they are called *warm and alluring*.

【一】【注】意尽形教，岂知我之独化于玄冥之竟哉！
*Commentary:* Though their minds and forms are fully shaped by external teachings, how could they know the Dao/Way of my singular transformation at the very limit of *Xuanming* (玄冥, the profound and dark)?

【疏】暖姝，自许之貌也。
*Explanation:* The *warm and alluring* are those who appear self-satisfied.

小见之人，学问寡薄，自悦〔自〕（一）足，谓穷微极妙，岂知所学未有一物可称也，
Men of limited vision, with shallow learning and few questions, delight in their own sufficiency, claiming to exhaust the subtle and reach the profound—yet they do not realize that all they have studied is not worth a single mention.

是以谓暖姝者，此言结前也。
Hence, they are called *warm and alluring*—this ties back to what was said earlier.

【释文】《自说》音悦。
*Phonetic Glosses:* *Zìyuè* (自说) is pronounced *yuè* (悦).

《之竟》音境。
*Zhījìng* (之竟) is pronounced *jìng* (境).

【校】（一）自字依正文补。
*Collation Notes:* (1) The word *zì* (自) is added here according to the original text.

濡需者，豕虱是也，择疏鬣（一）自以为广宫大囿，奎隈曲隈，乳间股脚，自以为安室利处，
Those who are *complacent and fleeting* are like the lice on a pig—picking out its sparse bristles, they fancy themselves as being in a vast palace and grand enclosure. They dwell in the hollows of its hooves and the gaps between its legs, thinking these to be comfortable lodgings and advantageous places—yet they do not know that when the butcher suddenly wields his knife, stirs the fire, and spreads straw, both the pig and the lice will be burned together.

此以域进，此以域退【二】，
This is how they advance within their own narrow confines, and this is how they decline within their own narrow confines【二】,

此其所谓濡需者也【三】。
Hence, they are called *complacent and fleeting*.

【一】【疏】濡需，矜夸之貌也。
*Explanation:* The *complacent and fleeting* are those who appear arrogant and boastful.

豕，猪也。
The pig is a pig.

言虱寄猪体上，择疏长之毛鬣，
The lice cling to the pig’s body, selecting its sparse and long bristles,

将为广大宫室苑囿。
to make them into vast palaces and grand enclosures.

蹄脚奎隈之所，股脚乳旁之间，
They dwell in the hollows of its hooves and the curves of its legs, in the gaps between its legs and beside its teats,

（蹄）用为温暖利便。
using these for warmth and ease.

岂知屠人忽操汤火，攘臂布草而杀之乎！
How could they know that when the butcher suddenly wields his knife, stirs the fire, and spreads straw, he will slaughter them?

即己与豕俱焦烂者也。」

「（Parable/Illustration） Those of shallow understanding in the world, indulging in sensual pleasures, are no different from the pig-louse and *complacent and fleeting* in their delight. 【Explanation】

*Peck* (虱) is pronounced *sè*.
*Kui* (奎) rhymes with *guì* (苦圭反), also written as *kui* (睽).
*Qu wei* (曲隈) rhymes with *huí* (乌回反).
Xu Xiang notes: "The space between its legs."
◎ Qing Fan notes: *Qūwēi* (曲隈) refers to the inner thigh (胯内). In general, when referring to *wēi* (隈), it denotes a hidden or recessed area. In the *Huainanzi* (淮南览冥篇), it says "渔者不争隈" (Fishermen do not vie for the *wēi*), and Gao Heng explains: *Wēi* (隈) is the deep curve where fish gather. In the *Liezi* (列子黄帝篇), "何曲之淫隈" (What is the excessive indulgence in the *wēi* of curves?), Yin Jingshun says: *Wēi* (隈) refers to the bends in water. In the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (僖二十五年左传), "秦人过析隈" (The Qin people passed through the *wēi* of Xi), Du Yu explains: *Wēi* (隈) is a secluded place. Thus, it is known that *wēi* (隈) refers to inner, curved, or recessed areas. Xu Xiang’s claim that *wēi* (隈) means the space between the legs is likely incorrect.

*Warm chamber* (暖室) rhymes with *nuǎn* (奴缓反) and *xūyuán* (虚袁反). One variant reads *ānshì* (安室).
◎ Lu Wenbian notes: "Today’s texts write it as *ānshì* (安室)."

*Operate* (操) rhymes with *cāo* (七曹反). 【二】

【Explanation】 *Domain* (域) refers to boundaries or realms. The pig-louse perishes as it follows the pig, and humans prosper or decline as they conform to external circumstances, hence they are said to advance or decline within their own *domains*.

【Annotation】 Those who lack the talent to transcend change and worldly affairs, contenting themselves with fleeting comforts, are all like pig-louse.

【Explanation】 This is the conclusion. ◎ The family elder says: "Advance within their own domain, decline within their own domain," meaning they rise or fall with the shifting preferences of the crowd. The *warm chamber* (暖姝) are those confined by knowledge; the *complacent and fleeting* (濡需) are those entangled in outward appearances; the *curled and weary* (卷娄) are those exhausted by responding to circumstances. These three share the same delusion, which is why Zhuangzi fled and abandoned them.

【Collation】 (One) The text is missing a reference to Zhang Junfang’s variant, which adds "long bristles" (长毛) after *máoliè* (毛鬣).
The *curled and weary* (卷娄) refers to Shun (舜).
The meat of a ram does not covet the ant, but the ant covets the meat of the ram, for the ram’s meat is *rancid* (膻).
Shun possessed *rancid deeds* (膻行), and the people rejoiced in them, hence his three relocations to Chengdu, until at *Xu* (虚) he had ten thousand households. 【二】
Emperor Yao, hearing of Shun’s virtue, elevated him from the humble land of *Tongtu* (童土), saying, "I hope to gain the blessings of his coming." 【三】
Shun was raised from the humble land of *Tongtu*, yet though his years grew long and his wisdom waned, he could not rest and return home—this is what is meant by *curled and weary*. 【四】
【一】【Explanation】 *Curl and weary* (卷娄) refers to bending the neck, bowing the back, and stooping forward in exhaustion.
The meat of a ram is *rancid* (膻) and foul-smelling, yet it has no desire to be coveted by ants; the ants hear its scent and come to it.
Shun had virtuous deeds, yet he did not seek the people’s favor, and the people rejoiced in him.
Thus, the ram’s meat is compared to Shun, and the ants are likened to the people.

【Explanation of Terms】 *The meat of a ram does not covet the ant* (羊肉不慕蚁) rhymes with *qí* (鱼绮反).
Li notes: "In old age, weary from labor, without the resolve to seek joy, it is like the ram’s meat not coveting the ant."
*Rancid* (膻) rhymes with *shānrán* (设然反).
*Rancid deeds* (膻行) rhymes with *shān* (下孟反).

「【二】【Explanation】 Shun avoided Dan Zhu, and yet he did not wish to be surrounded by crowds, so he fled three times, moving and shifting to evade him. The people admired his virtue, and ten thousand followed him, making wherever he settled a thriving city.

When he reached Deng (邓), it was a place name. *Deng* (虚) is pronounced *xū* (like "shu" in 墟).

Originally written as *xū* (墟).

【三】【Explanation】 *Tongtu* (童土) means barren land without grass or trees. Emperor Yao, upon hearing of Shun’s sage-like virtue, married him to his daughters, Ehuang and Nuying (娥皇、女英), and chose him as his successor, yielding the Mandate of Heaven to him. Shun dwelled in the unproductive land, endured trials of hardship, and yet his benevolence extended to the neighboring states through the *Chengyi* (承仪) ritual, while the common people benefited from his governance. 【释文】 *Tongtu* (童土) is read as characters, but also as *dù* (like "du" in 杜). Master Xiang explains: "Tongtu (童土) is land without grass or trees."

【四】【Annotation】 The form of a sage does not differ from that of an ordinary person, so their sensory faculties may weaken with age—yet their spirit remains ever whole. (二) If their virtue is not yet complete in youth, and their faculties decline as they age, then how could a sage truly be a sage? Could it happen in a single morning?

【Explanation】 Having ascended to the throne, his authority spanning the ten thousand chariots, he bore *min* (pity/compassion) for the common folk, worrying and caring for them. Thus, as his years grew long and his age advanced, his ears and eyes grew feeble, and he had no chance to rest. How could he return home? His form was bent and weary, his body labored and his spirit exhausted—this is what is meant by *curled and weary*. 【释文】 *Zǐ cháng* (齿长) is pronounced *dīng zhàng* (like "ding zhang" in 丁丈反). Annotation agrees.

「◎ Regency Fan annotates: According to the *Huáyán Jīng* (Sūtra of the Avataṃsaka) *Yīnyì* (Meaning and Sound), Master Sīmǎ (司马) says: *Chǐ* (齿) means "counting" or "reckoning." Annotation is missing.

*Rú shào* (若少) is pronounced *shī chào* (like "shi chao" in 诗召反).

【Correction】 (一) Zhào Jiànyì (赵谏议) reads it as *xū* (墟).
(二) Zhào's version omits the *ěr* (耳) character.

Thus, the **Daoist adept** abhors the **multitude arriving**【one】—when the multitude arrives, they do not harmonize, and if they do not harmonize, it is not advantageous【two】. Therefore, they have no particular favorites, no particular estrangements; they embrace **virtue/power** (德) in serene balance, letting the **Dao/Way** (道) flow naturally to order the world. This is what is called the **True Person**【three】.

With ants, they abandon knowledge; with fish, they gain strategy; with sheep, they abandon intent【four】.

【One】【Annotation】 The multitude comes of its own accord, not summoned by affection【one】.
【Exegesis】 The Sage three times distanced himself from the people—this was out of aversion.
【Sound Annotation】 *Wù zhòng* (恶众) is pronounced *wū lù* (乌路反). *Fēi hǎo* (非好) is pronounced *hū bào* (呼报反).

【Two】【Annotation】 The reason Shùn (舜) possessed the **dharma/realm** (天下) was simply that he had no alternative—how could one say he gained advantage through comparison?
【Exegesis】 *Bǐ* (比) means "harmonize." When the multitude gathers, there is no harmony, and without harmony, it is not advantageous to me.
【Sound Annotation】 *Bù bǐ* (不比) is pronounced *pí zhì* (毗志反). The following annotation is the same as above.」

「【Three】【Exegesis】 *Yáng* (炀) is "gentleness." The Sage who does not fathom the divine person—whether near or far—embracing and guarding gentleness and harmony, may indeed be called a true saint.
【Sound Annotation】 *Yáng* (炀) is pronounced *yáng* (羊, Goo Yung) by Guo, *yáng* (余亮, Yu Yung) by Xu. *Hé* (和) is pronounced *hé* (李云：炀，炙也， for "yáng" is *zhì* (炙, Zhih) when baked by harmonious *qi* (气)).

【Four】【Annotation】 To the people, he is obscured by beneficence; to Shùn (舜), he appears as toil.
【Exegesis】 He does not covet the kindness of a lamb’s heart, hence to ants, he abandons knowledge; he does not indulge in the *qi* (气) of teaching with his own scent, hence to sheep, he abandons intent. Having cast aside kindness and righteousness, aligning with the Supreme Dao/Way, without harming the smallest creature, forgotten in the rivers and lakes, thus to fish, he gains strategy. These words censure Shùn’s *qi* (气) of teaching, hence their inclusion here.

【Sound Annotation】 *Yú mǐ qì zhì* (于蚁弃智) is pronounced *qì zhì* (智). *Yú yú dé jì yú yáng qì yì* (于鱼得计于羊弃意) is pronounced by Sima: ants die when they encounter *qi* (气), fish live when they encounter *qi*, sheep sicken when they encounter *qi*. Another account says: the divine person has no *qi* (气), hence ants do not gather—this is why ants abandon knowledge; in the great Dao/Way of mutual forgetting, without the *power* (德) of clinging, this is why fish gain strategy; sheep abandon intent because they lack the *qi* (气) of teaching, yet ants do not gather.

◎ *Jiāshì Fù* (家世父) said: That which the Sage detests in the multitude’s gathering is their *harmonization* (比). The reason for *harmonization* is to indulge in advantage. The divine person, when the multitude gathers, does not *harmonize*—precisely because he does not indulge in advantage. Ants cling to the *qi* (气) because they seek advantage—this is their *knowledge* (智); sheep’s *qi* (气) is given to them as something to indulge in—this is their *intent* (意). Ants have no *knowledge* yet are said to have it; sheep have no *intent* yet are said to have it—only the *qi* (气) of advantage. Fish forget themselves in the rivers and lakes, people forget themselves in Dao/Way and arts—what is there to covet in the *qi* (气) of advantage? Hence it is said: *to fish, he gains strategy*.

【Annotation】 (1) The *Shìdé Táng* (世德堂) edition reads *zhi* (之), while the *Zhào Jiànyì* (赵谏议) edition omits it.

With eyes seeing eyes, ears hearing ears, hearts mirroring hearts (1). If so, his balance is measured by a plumb line (2), his transformations follow the natural course (3). The ancient true persons awaited *heaven* (天) without *human* (人) intervention (4), and did not force *human* (人) into *heaven* (天) (5). The ancient true persons—when they obtained it, they lived; when they lost it, they died; when they obtained it, they died; when they lost it, they lived (6).

【Annotation】 (1) These three refer to those who have not yet attained the absence of sensory perception and mental intent.
【Exegesis】 What the eyes see, what the ears hear, what the heart knows—if one does not pursue external things but knows to stop within their proper bounds, this is the Dao/Way of the true person.

【Annotation】 (2) They have not yet abandoned the plumb line to achieve self-balance.
【Exegesis】 The plumb line is upright without intent; the Sage forgets personal bias and remains equitable.

【Sound Annotation】 *Néng qù* (能去) is pronounced *qù* (起吕, Khih Lu).
【Annotation】 (3) They have not yet severed traces to achieve mysterious unity.
【Exegesis】 *Xún* (循) means "to follow." In the world, one shines harmoniously, through myriad changes and transformations, following the vast life of the people, yet never opposing the few.

【Annotation】 (4) To dwell in non-action and await action, action thus obtains.
【Exegesis】 As explained above, this is the Dao/Way of the ancient true person—employing the natural Way, emptying the heart to await things.

【Annotation】 (5) To seek non-action through action, the more one acts, the wilder it becomes.
【Exegesis】 If one does not use human intervention to choose or reject, one disrupts the natural wisdom of *heaven* (天).

【Annotation】 (6) Life and death, gain and loss—each follows its own nature; in life, it is gain; in death, it may be loss—there is no fixed constant.
【Exegesis】 If one speaks of dwelling in life, then life is gain; if one speaks from the standpoint of death, then life becomes ruin. Since life and death are without fixed nature, where does gain or loss truly lie? Alas, it is uncertain! Hence, blending life and death, gain and loss as one, he is called the true person.

◎ *Jiāshì Fù* (家世父) said: The mutual reliance of form and *qi* (气)—when obtained, one lives; when lost, one dies—is a *harmonization* (比) that aligns. The natural Way awaiting transformation—when obtained, one dies; when lost, one lives—is a *commission* (委) that listens. When obtained, it is life—hence there is *action* (有为) and *non-action* (无为); when obtained, it is death—hence there is *non-action* (无为) and *non-action* without *non-action* (无不为).

【Sound Annotation】 *Hùfù* (或复) is pronounced *fù* (扶又, Fu Yow).

【Annotation】 (1) The *Shìdé Táng* (世德堂) edition mistakenly cites Zhang Junfang’s (张君房) text; the character *人* (人) should be corrected.

Now, *yào* (药) indeed has its efficacy, yet *qín* (菫) is *zhèng* (桔梗), *jī yōng* (鸡壅) is *jī tóu cǎo* (鸡头草), *shǐ líng* (豕零) is the root of *zhū líng* (猪苓), resembling a pig’s egg, treating thirst disease. These are all lowly medicines. *Dì* (帝) refers to the sovereign—what more can be said of his times!

【Annotation】 (1) When it is needed, it is not lowly; when it is not needed, it is not noble. Nobility and lowliness are contingent upon time—who can remain constant?」

「Indeed, medicine has no inherent nobility or lowliness—what heals the disease is excellent. When the medicine and the disease align, it becomes the sovereign’s tool.

Thus, even the act of seeing with one’s eyes and hearing with one’s ears, grasping with one’s hands and knowing with one’s heart, all depend on circumstances—whether they flourish or decay. Therefore, in times when such qualities are esteemed, they serve as sovereigns; when they fail to meet the world’s needs, they become ministers. This is a certainty of affairs, so how can one exhaustively speak of it?

【Sound Annotation】 *Qín* (堇) is pronounced *jǐn* (谨, Jin), Guo’s reading as *jìn* (觐, Jin), and Xu’s reading as *jìn* (靳, Jin).
*Jié* (桔) is pronounced *jié* (结, Jie); originally also written as *jié* (结).
*Gěng* (梗) in ancient times rhymed with *měng* (猛, Meng).
*Jī yōng* (鸡壅) is read *jī yōng* (鸡头, Ji Yow) by Xu; originally also written as *yōng* (壅), with the same pronunciation.
*Shǐ líng* (豕零) is read by Sima as *shǐ náng* (猪囊, Shi Nang), meaning: another name for *zhū líng* (猪苓), its root resembling a pig’s egg, used to treat thirst disease.

These four are all names of medicinal herbs. *Shìdé Táng* (世德堂) reads: *"When it is needed, the herbs are sovereigns"*—Sima explains: "The herbs, at times, succeed one another as sovereigns, meaning their efficacy rises and falls, each fulfilling its proper use."*」

「◎ *Qìng Fān* notes: *"Shí"* (时) means *"change"* (more); *"Dì"* (帝) means *"master"* (chief). The herbs *Qín* (堇), *Jiégěng* (桔梗), *Jī yōng* (鸡壅), and *Shǐ líng* (豕零) succeed one another as sovereigns—each fulfilling its proper use.

*The Fāngyán* (方言) states: *"Shì"* (莳) means *"change"* (more).
(*Shì*—Guo’s reading as *shì* (侍); the ancient texts lacked the character *shì*, borrowing *shí* (时) instead.)

*The Ěryǎ* (尔雅) states: *"Dì"* (帝) means *"lord"* (ruler). The *Huáinán Zhènglùn* (淮南正论) chapter *"Shí"* (时) says: *"to replace and serve as sovereign."* The *Qísú* (齐俗) chapter says: *"this is to serve as sovereign"* (here *"Dì"* is mistakenly written as *"Cháng"* (常) in modern texts).

The *Tàipíng Yùlàn* (太平御览) cites *Féng Yǎn* (冯衍) and *Dèng Yǔ* (邓禹) annotations: *"This is to serve as the fitting one"* (where *"shì"* is read as *"zhí"* (嫡), and *Guǎngyǎ* (广雅) defines *"zhí"* as *"lord"* (ruler)).

Some say *"shí"* (时), some say *"dài"* (代), some say *"gēng"* (更), but their meanings are the same.
(*Fāngyán*: *"more"* is *"change"* (代); *Shuōwén*: *"change"* is *"replace"* (代).)

*Shèngyán* (胜言) is pronounced *shēng* (升).
*Jùjiàn* (句践) was a king of *Yuè* (越), yet he had only *3,000 soldiers* (甲楯三千) *sheltered* (栖) *at Kuāijī* (会稽).
Only *Zhǒng* (种) knew how the kingdom could survive, yet he failed to grasp his own doom.
Thus it is said: *"The owl’s eyes fit the night but not the day; the crane’s legs suit long strides but not short"*—when removed, they bring sorrow.

**[一]**
*Cush* (疏): *Jùjiàn* (句践) was the king of *Yuè* (越). *Kuāijī* (会稽) is a mountain. *Yuè* was ravaged by *Wú* (吴) forces, driven into retreat, and took refuge in *Kuāijī* mountain.

*Shìwén* (释文): *"Jùjiàn"* (句践) is read as *gōu* (钩). *"Jiǎdǐng"* (甲楯) is read *chún yǐn* (纯尹) by *Xu* (徐), or *yǐn* (尹). *"Qī yú"* (栖于) is read *xī* (西). *Lǐ* (李) notes: *"Qī"* (栖) means *"to ascend"* (登山). *"Kuài"* (会) is read *wài* (外), *"jī"* (稽) as *jī* (鸡).

**[二]**
*Cush* (疏): *Zhǒng* (种), a great official of *Yuè* (越), at the time of *Jùjiàn*’s great defeat, had only 3,000 soldiers left. Retreating to *Kuāijī* mountain, the kingdom’s annihilation seemed imminent. Yet *Zhǒng* plotted deeply and wisely, knowing that survival was possible. He then secretly forged an alliance with *Wú* (吴), and twenty years later, *Yuè* (越) extinguished *Wú* (吴).

The cunning fox dies, and the loyal dog is boiled; the enemy state is conquered, and the faithful minister perishes—such is the fate. After *Wú*’s defeat, *Fàn Lǐ* (范蠡) abandoned *Yuè* (越), wandering the *Jiānghǎi* (江海) region, altering his name and lineage, concealing his brilliance and obscuring his traces—he became *Táo Zhū Gōng* (陶朱公). The great official *Zhǒng* (种) did not flee, and was executed by *Jùjiàn*. Though he knew the kingdom could survive, he failed to see his own death.

(*Note: Some texts write "穜" instead of "种", reading it the same way.*)

*Shìwén* (释文): *"Zhǒng"* (穜) is read *zhāng yǒng* (章勇), a great official of *Yuè* (越). The *Chūnqiū* (春秋) *Yúè* (越) states: *"His surname was Wén (文), given name Shàoqín (少禽)."* *"Kěyǐ cún"* (可以存) is also written *"sùyǐ cún"* (所以存), meaning: *"to know that though Yuè was defeated, survival was still possible."*

**[三]**
*Zhù* (注): Each thing has its proper use at a given time; if it strays beyond its limits, it will sometimes fail, and sometimes fail, hence it brings sorrow.
(*Shì*—"to remove" (去).)

*Cush* (疏): The owl’s eyes are dark by day but open at night, thus fitting the night but not the day; the crane’s legs are long due to its nature, thus suited for long strides but not short ones. Branches and nodes are like this—when removed, they bring sorrow, just as *Zhǒng* excelled in preserving the kingdom but failed in safeguarding his own life.

*Shìwén* (释文): *"Xiā"* (鸱) is read *chǐ yí* (尺夷). *"Tìng"* (胫) is read *xíng dìng* (刑定). *"Jiě zhī"* (解之) is read *jiā mǎi* (佳买). *Sīmǎ* (司马) reads *"shì"* (去) as *"jiě"* (解). Another reading is *"xiè"* (懈).»

Thus it is said: *"When the wind passes over the river, it is harmed; when the sun passes over the river, it is harmed"* **[一]**.
If the wind and the sun were to jointly guard the river, the river would still not be fully shielded **[二]**, relying on its source alone **[三]**.
Hence, water guards the land with vigilance, shadows guard the person with vigilance, and things guard their own kind with vigilance **[四]**.

**[一]**
*Zhù* (注): Things with form naturally harm one another; only those beyond form are worn down without diminishing.

**[二]**
*Zhù* (注): Though already harmed, they remain unaware.

---
**[三]**
*Zhù* (注): The reason they remain unaware is not that they are not harmed; they rely on their source.

---
**[四]**
*Cush* (疏): *"Shěn"* (审) means *"settled"* (安定). Water is not settled unless it is land; shadows are unseen unless there is a person; things cannot stand unless they are created by their own kind. Thus the three guard their respective objects and consider themselves secure.

Yet new and old never remain constant; survival and ruin never pause. What was yesterday’s thing is today’s transformation; mountains and ships shift and vanish, and the ignorant do not know—such is the meaning.

*Jiào* (校): (*Note: Sīmǎ* (世德堂) reads *"fū"* (夫) instead of *"hū"* (乎).)

Thus, *"the eyes’ relation to brightness is precarious, the ears’ relation to sharpness is precarious, the heart’s relation to devotion is precarious"* **[一]**.
All things that excel in their domain are precarious; the completion of precariousness is not swift nor easy **[二]**.»

The calamity’s growth is here concentrated **[三]**,
Its reversal stems from merit **[四]**,
Its fruition awaits prolonged time **[五]**.

Yet people regard it as their own treasure—
Is this not sorrowful **[六]**!

Thus there are nations lost and citizens slaughtered without end **[七]**,
Yet they fail to question this—how tragic **[八]**.

**[One] [Annotation]**: If there is intent, there is no precipice—
Thus, it is precarious.

**[Exegesis]**: Devotion means pursuit.
To see with the eyes is what they perceive,
To listen with the ears is what they hear,
And the heart’s pursuit is what it follows.
If the eyes seek the brightness of **Lìzhū** (離朱),
If the ears demand the sharpness of **Shīkuàng** (師旷),
If the heart chases the boundless wisdom of **wúyá** (無崖),
How could desire not be perilous?
What chance of attainment is there!

**Jiāshìfù** (家世父) said:
Water guards the land—two entities,
Mutually reliant and interdependent;
The shadow guards the person—one entity becoming two,
Self-generated and self-transformed;
Things guard their own kind—returning and self-verified,
Embracing unity.

So it is called *precarious*—
No external distraction.
When the eyes stray, brightness arises;
When the ears stray, sharpness emerges;
When the heart strays, its devotion is revealed.
All that excel in their domain are external distractions **[二]**.

(And) when they reverse to their own inherent nature,
Yet cling to it as merit,
Striving for fruition,
Accumulating time while unaware of its end,
Exhausting the senses and mind in contention with myriad things—
Thus, it is sorrowful.

**[Two] [Annotation]**: Hence, it is valued that one has no power
And trusts in natural endowment.

**[Exegesis]**: Those who wield the wisdom of differentiation,
Emerging from the **藏府** (藏府),
And boast of their own abilities—
Necessarily court peril and ruin.
Thus, even with success,
It does not return fully and they regret their choices.

**[Three] [Annotation]**: Concentrated means gathered.
If one cannot forget wisdom,
Then the growth of calamity is manifold.

**[Exegesis]**: Growth means increase.
Concentrated means gathered.
When the **藏府** (藏府) are overburdened,
Their abilities are self-revealed,
Thus, misfortune and disasters grow and gather in abundance.

**[Phonetic Release]**: *«之长»* (zhī cháng) – **Dīngzhàng** (丁丈) rhyme.
Annotation as above.

「《Zī Xīn》—[Phonetic] *zī shēn* [so-pern] (反).
Guō [commentary]: *cùi* [gather].
Lǐ [commentary]: *duō* [many].

**[Four] [Annotation]**: If one returns to guarding one’s nature,
Then its virtue/power acts without effort and achieves completion.

**[Exegesis]**: Those who boast of their own abilities and thereby invite disaster—
It is because, upon achieving success, they do not retreat.
Thus, they court ruin.

**[Five] [Annotation]**: Desiring haste, one does not attain fruition.

**[Exegesis]**: When one sincerely strives for success,
Arrogance and self-praise are inevitable.
With lingering expectations, the days are indeed long.

**[Six] [Annotation]**: *Jǐ bǎo* [one’s own treasure]—
This refers to possessing knowledge and ability.

**[Exegesis]**: [Exiled] wanderers,
Their minds steeped in ignorance,
Treasure their own abilities,
And when success comes, they cling to it stubbornly—
Truly, this is most pitiable.

**[Seven] [Annotation]**: All bear the calamities of their own bodies.

**[Exegesis]**: Greedily seizing lands as their own great treasure,
Taking them by unjust means,
Nations crumble, families perish,
And countless common folk are slaughtered—
The ruin is boundless.

**[Eight] [Annotation]**: If one does not inquire into the origins of disaster,
It arises from the mind’s intentions,
And through cultivating the mind, one may avert disaster.

**[Exegesis]**: In the world, there are wise men—
Like tortoiseshell and mirrors.
If one does not inquire into the causes of ruin,
But only fears poverty and lowly status,
This is the height of folly.

**[Collation Note]**: (一) The current text reads *cùi* [gather].

The foot’s relation to the earth is to tread upon it,
Though it treads, it relies on the untrodden ground to move far.
The mind’s relation to knowledge is limited,
Though limited, it relies on the unknown to comprehend the **Dao/Way**’s intent.

Know the **Great Oneness**,
Know the **Great Yin**,
Know the **Great Vision**,
Know the **Great Equilibrium**,
Know the **Great Rectitude**,
Know the **Great Faith**,
Know the **Great Stability**—
This is the pinnacle.

The **Great Oneness** is penetrated **[through Dao]**,
The **Great Yin** is dissolved **[by its use]**,
The **Great Vision** is observed **[with clarity]**,
The **Great Equilibrium** is followed **[in harmony]**,
The **Great Rectitude** is embodied **[in action]**,
The **Great Faith** is verified **[by reflection]**,
The **Great Stability** is upheld **[with constancy]**.

**[One] [Exegesis]**: *Tread* and *step*—both imply walking.
The foot’s ability to move depends on the earth,
Yet it relies on the untrodden soil to walk far.
If there were no remaining ground,
There would be no way to advance safely and reach distant places.
This is an analogy.

**[Phonetic Release]**: *«恃其所不蹍»* (*shì qí suǒ bù tà*) – *nǚ zhǎn* [female-expanse] rhyme.
Lǐ [commentary]: One foot remains unmoving, thus able to traverse vast distances.

**[Note by Yú Yù]**: Both instances of *dian* [tread] should likely be *qiǎn* [shallow], either a scribal error or ancient interchange.
The foot’s relation to the earth is merely to accommodate it—
Thus, it is said: *The foot’s relation to the earth is shallow.*
Yet beyond what contains the foot, though seemingly useless, it cannot be discarded—
Hence: *Though shallow, it relies on the untrodden to move far and wide.*
The *Wàiwù Piān* states:
*"The earth is not lacking in breadth and grandeur—
Man uses only what fits beneath his feet."*
Then, if one were to dig beneath the feet to reach the Yellow Springs,
Would there still be any use for man?
This is the same principle.
Below, it states:
*"The mind’s relation to knowledge is limited,
Though limited, it relies on the unknown to comprehend the **Dao/Way**’s intent."*
*Shǎo* [limited] and *qiǎn* [shallow] share a similar meaning in context.
If rendered as *dian* [tread], it would not make sense.

**[Two] [Annotation]**: To forget the heavens and earth,
To abandon all things,
Then even the wings of a cicada may be known—
How much more so to comprehend the **Dao/Way**’s intent,
While harboring no intentional mind?

**[Exegesis]**: Knowledge has its bright and dark aspects,
Abilities have their few and many—
Each abides by its measure,
Then all things move freely.
Thus, the earth relies on the untrodden to walk,
The mind relies on the unknown to illuminate.
This is why one dwells in stillness and nurtures tranquility—
The natural principle of the **Dao/Way**,
As the ancient texts say:
*"Having it brings benefit; lacking it brings use."*
This is an illustrative analogy.

**[Three] [Exegesis]**: Here, the seven great capacities of knowledge are briefly named—
This may be called the ultimate attainment.
From here onward, their meanings are elaborated.

**[Four] [Annotation]**: **Dao/Way**.

**[Exegesis]**: Oneness is the principle of **Yang**.
The **Great Oneness** is the heavens,
Capable of permeating and giving birth to all things—
Thus, it is called *penetrated*.

**[Five] [Annotation]**: If one acts within one’s proper measure,
Then all affairs proceed without obstruction.

**[Exegesis]**: The **Great Yin** is the earth,
Operating without intention yet without division—
It is the form of things.
**[Phonetic Release]**: *«解之»* (*jiě zhī*) – *xiè* [crab] sound.
Same below.
Also *jiǎ mǎi* [fine-buy] rhyme.

「**[Six]** **[Annotation]**: To employ the self-revealing nature of all things—
this is also the **Great Vision**.

**[Exegesis]**: Each perceives what it sees as the **Great Vision**.

**[Seven]** **[Annotation]**: To follow their inherent nature,
allowing each to attain its own fulfillment—
this is the **Great Harmony**.

**[Exegesis]**: *Yuan* means *following*.
The **Great Following** ensures all things attain their full and balanced nature.

**[Phonetic Release]**: *«令各»* (*lìng gè*) – *li* [force] *cheng* [present] sound.
Same below.

**[Eight]** **[Annotation]**: To respond to things appropriately without fixed methods—
this is the **Great Rectitude**.

**[Nine]** **[Annotation]**: To accord with each thing’s proper measure—
this is the **Great Fidelity**.

**[Ten]** **[Annotation]**: When things are true and unyielding,
they naturally settle themselves—
thus, to hold them with **Great Stillness**—
this is *not* holding them.

**[Exegesis]**: All things are inherently empty;
to grasp and employ them—
their essence remains empty.

**[Eleven]** **[Annotation]**: Things have no beginning without their own natural unfolding.

**[Exegesis]**: The seven great capacities above
all arise from their own inherent nature.

**[Twelve]** **[Annotation]**: To follow them is to be enlightened;
there is no need for contrivance.

**[Exegesis]**: *Follow* means *to accord*.
Only by aligning with their natural endowment
does wisdom spontaneously illuminate.

**[Thirteen]** **[Annotation]**: Ultimate principles have their limits;
one must only *dimly* grasp them—
thus, their core essentials are obtained without labor or deliberation.

**[Exegesis]**: The profound and mysterious principles
have their own pivotal mechanisms,
yet employing them requires no exertion or intention.

**[Phonetic Release]**: *«枢»* (*shū*) – *si* [shear] *zhu* [vermilion] sound.

**[Fourteen]** **[Annotation]**: Those who first possess it are *them*;
thus, I expound without creation.

**[Exegesis]**: Guo’s annotation states:
Those who first possess it are *them*;
thus, I expound without creation.

**[Fifteen]** **[Annotation]**: To release and entrust to others,
others will themselves release;
releasing without effort—
thus, it seems as though not releasing.

**[Exegesis]**: The body learns from others to release;
if one does not cultivate virtue into nature—
it is not like not releasing.

**[Sixteen]** **[Annotation]**: To clearly perceive others’ knowing—
this is the **Great Vision**.

**[Exegesis]**: One who can forget their own knowing
seems as though they do not know—
thus, it appears as not knowing.

**[Seventeen]** **[Annotation]**: If I do not know,
then others’ knowing unfolds naturally;
when others’ knowing unfolds naturally—
then all under heaven come to know.

**[Exegesis]**: Not knowing while knowing,
knowing while not knowing—
this is not knowing through knowing;
thus, not knowing yet knowing—
this is true knowing.

**[Eighteen]** **[Annotation]**: To respond to things with fitting measure yet without fixed method.

**[Nineteen]** **[Annotation]**: Each thing must adhere to its own measure.

**[Twenty]** **[Annotation]**: Though all things differ in their *preposterous and chaotic* nature,
each thing possesses its own reality.

**[Exegesis]**: *Preposterous and chaotic* means *diverse*.
The myriad things in tumultuous disarray,
yet unified and governed—
all derive from the reality of the **Dao/Way**.

**[Phonetic Release]**: *«颉»* (*jié*) – *xu* [smooth] *xia* [down] *jie* [join] sound.
*«滑»* (*huá*) – *hu* [ lake] *ba* [eight] sound.
Previously stated: *Preposterous and chaotic* refers to *erratic confusion*.

**[Twenty-One]** **[Annotation]**: Each thing has its own origin;
they cannot be substituted for one another.

**[Exegesis]**: The ancient remains in the ancient,
not following the ancient to become the present;
the present remains in the present,
not following the present to become the ancient.
Things each have their own nature—
new and old do not interchange or replace one another.

**[Twenty-Two]** **[Annotation]**: Each thing must fulfill its proper measure.

**[Exegesis]**: Time does not pass back and forth;
the **dharma** does not shift or trade.
How could one rely on the ancient to become the present!

**[Twenty-Three]** **[Annotation]**: To *enforce and elevate*—
there is a great boundary.

**[Exegesis]**: As previously asked—
its **Dao/Way** is vast and profound;
is it not said that to *enforce and elevate* the wondrous principles
and *enforce* the true discourse?

**[Phonetic Release]**: *«扬搉»* (*yáng jiǎo*) – *jue* [angle], or *ku* [苦] *xue* [学] sound.
The *Three Cang* states: *搉* means *enemy*.
Qingfan notes: *搉* should be *敲* [enforce].
The *Shuowen Jiezi* says: *搉* means *to strike*.
In the *Han Shu Wuxing Zhi*, *"搉其眼"* [striking its eyes], Shenggu’s annotation says:
*"搉"* means *to strike out its essence*.
The characters *搉* and *敲* are mistaken due to similar shapes.
Xu Shen says: *扬搉* means *rough and crude laws*.
Wang says: *To enforce and elevate* means *to roughly enforce and vividly display*.

**[Twenty-Four]** **[Annotation]**: If one asks of the **Great Enforcement**,
then things have their utmost measure—
thus, the principle of *forgetting oneself and entrusting to things* can be known,
why should one be so confused!

**[Exegesis]**: *He* means *why not*.
*Deliberate* means *ask*.
The unenlightened, like one wandering at night,
why not consult the sages!
And when their weakness and loss lead to bewilderment and suffering—
what is this for!

**[Twenty-Five]** **[Annotation]**: Confusion cannot be resolved;
thus, the **Great Unconfusion** is the utmost stupidity—
this is why the sages follow and entrust to it,
so that sovereigns and kings distinguish their traces,
adapting to the world and assuming names.

**[Exegesis]**: The **Dao/Way** is vast, its virtue profound;
its transformations are infinite, its changes boundless.
The myriad things arise and pass away,
yet it does not deplete or exhaust.
Thus, it is said: *Why not call it the **Great Exhaustion**!* [13]
The **Dao/Way** is not questioned—
why should one be so confused!
To resolve confusion with *unconfusion*,
returning to *unconfusion*—
this is the **Great Unconfusion**. [2]」

「**[Exegesis]** The sages are free from confusion, yet confusion lies in the common emotions.
With the sages’ wisdom discerning the common confusions,
they forget and attain the original root,
returning to the true foundation,
yet cannot abandon their grasp on words
and cling to the sages’ traces—
revering explicit speech,
treating *unconfusion* as supreme,
this is why they hold *unconfusion* in awe—
how could they ever dispel confusion!

**[Exegesis]**: *Why not call it the **Great Exhaustion**!* [13]
*Unconfusion* is not questioned—
why should one be so confused!
To resolve confusion with *unconfusion*,
returning to *unconfusion*—
this is the **Great Unconfusion**. [2]

**[Annotation]**: This chapter is named after a person.
**Then-Yang** visited Chu [1],
and **Yi-Jie** spoke to the king,
but the king did not see him,
so **Yi-Jie** withdrew [2].

**[Exegesis]**: **Then-Yang** (姓彭, 名陽, 字則陽), a man of Lu,
traveled to serve the feudal lords,
later entering Chu to serve **Chu Wen Wang**.
**[Exegesis]**: Of **Then-Yang**, Sima says: his name was **Then-Yang** (則陽), and his courtesy name was **Peng-Yang** (彭陽).
Another account says: surname **Peng** (彭), given name **Then-Yang** (則陽), a man of early Zhou.

**[Exegesis]**: **Yi-Jie** (夷節), a Chu subject,
wishing to serve in Chu,
thus approached **Then-Yang** to speak to the king,
but the king, though esteemed, still did not see him.
**Yi-Jie’s** recommendation did not succeed,
so he left the court and returned home.
**[Exegesis]**: **Yi-Jie** was a Chu subject.
**Then-Yang** saw **King Guo** (王果) and said:
“Master, why do you not speak of me to the king?” [1]

**[Exegesis]**: **King Guo** (王果) was a virtuous and eminent minister of Chu.
*Speak of me* (谭我) means to recommend me.
Before, he had relied on **Yi-Jie**,
but since he had not yet been seen by the king,
now he spoke to **King Guo**,
hoping he would recommend me.
**[Exegesis]**: Of **King Guo**, Sima says: a virtuous man of Chu.
*Speak of me* (谭) is pronounced *tan*, also written as *tan* (談).
Li says: *speak* (说).
Guo’s pronunciation is *tu kǎn* (徒堪), Xu’s is *tu àn* (徒暗).
**King Guo** said:
“I am not as capable as **Gong Yue Xiu** (公閱休) [1].

**[Exegesis]**: *As capable* (若) means *like*.
**Gong Yue Xiu** (公閱休) was the title of a recluse.
Though **King Guo** was virtuous,
he feared **Then-Yang’s** hasty ambition for honor,
so he praised the recluse
to suppress his forwardness.
**[Exegesis]**: Of **Gong Yue Xiu**, Sima says: a recluse.
*Yue* (閱) is pronounced *yue* (悅).
**Then-Yang** said:
“What is **Gong Yue Xiu** (公閱休) doing?” [1]

**[Exegesis]**: *Del* (奚) means *what*.
Since **Then-Yang** had just praised **Gong Yue Xiu**,
saying he was not as capable,
now he asked *what he was doing*
to hear the reason why.
He said:
“In winter, I spear the turtles in the Jiang;
in summer, I rest in the mountain thickets.
If someone passes by and asks,
I say: *‘This is my dwelling.’* [1]
Since **Yi-Jie** could not do this,
how much less could I!
I am not as capable as **Yi-Jie**.

**Yi-Jie**, as a man,
had no virtue but only wisdom—
he did not permit himself,
yet relied on his cleverness to secure his connections,
wandering lost in the realm of wealth and nobility, [2]
not truly assisting with virtue,
but merely aiding in ruin. [3]

The frozen seek warmth in spring’s clothing,
the thirsty turn to winter’s icy winds. [4]
The king of Chu,
as a man, was stern in form and imposing;
toward crimes, he was merciless as a tiger—
unless it was a flatterer with upright virtue,
who else could endure this? [5] [1]

**[Exegesis]**: These words were spoken
to suppress **Then-Yang’s** forwardness.
**[Exegesis]**: *Spear* (擉) means to pierce.
*Fang* (樊) means *beside* or *thicket of trees*.
In deep winter, he pierces turtles by the riverside,
living leisurely on the riverbank;
in scorching summer, he returns to rest,
lying down in the dense forest and finding ease—
since he had no enclosed residence,
he points to the mountain’s edge as his dwelling.
This briefly describes **Gong Yue Xiu’s** conduct.

**[Exegesis]**: *Spear* (擉) is pronounced *chū jiǎo* (初角) or *chì jiǎo* (敕角).
Sima says: *to pierce*.
Guo’s pronunciation is *chù* (触), Xu’s is *dīng lù* (丁绿), another is *zhuō* (捉).
◎ **Lu Wenbian** (卢文弨) says: the old *zhuō* (捉) was mistakenly written as *cù* (促); now corrected.
◎ **Qing Fan** (庆藩) notes that *Guangyun* (广韵) cites Sima: *擉鳖* means *to pierce*, slightly differing from the exegesis.
*Fang* (樊) is pronounced *fán* (烦).
Li says: *beside*.
Sima says: *in the shade*.
*Guangya* (广雅) says: *edge*.
*This is my dwelling* (予宅) — Sima says: *he displays his reclusive dwelling in the mountain shade*.

**[Exegesis]**: These words imply
that I am not as fond of wealth and nobility as **Yi-Jie**,
who could secure his connections,
his intent being to pursue fame and fortune,
wandering lost in the realm of wealth and nobility,
yet lacking true virtue,
merely relying on cleverness to curry favor with superiors.
Though he acts thus repeatedly,
he still cannot succeed—
how much less could I, who cling to my stupidity,
dare to recommend myself!
These are the words of **King Guo’s** humble refusal.

**[Exegesis]**: *Having wisdom* (有知) is pronounced *zhì* (智).
The annotation is the same.
*Wandering lost* (颠冥) is pronounced *mián* (眠).
Sima says: *wandering lost* means *confused and lost*.
He speaks of **Yi-Jie’s** firm connections with the ruler,
his heart set on wealth and nobility.

**[Exegesis]**: *Ruined* (消) means *to harm or diminish*.
He says: **Then-Yang** relies on me to speak of him to the king,
yet this would only harm his reputation and virtue,
certainly not enhance his upright character.

**[Exegesis]**: These words imply
that though I follow the natural order of the seasons,
I cannot meet **Then-Yang’s** urgent needs.

**[Exegesis]**: The frozen,
when they obtain clothing,
are warmed by it;»

Those scorched by the heat (者), when they encounter water, are revived by it.
Yet they wait for the **Yánghé** (阳和) to thaw the frost,
or for the cold wind to relieve their scorching,
though this may seem contrary to human affairs,
it is in truth in accord with the Dao/Way of Heaven.

Following the Dao/Way to reach others,
his body bears no close favor,
he does not advance **Then-Yáng** (彭阳),
and his virtue/power is likewise.

**[Exegesis]**: *Scorched* (暍) is pronounced *yè* (谒).
The *Zìlín* (字林) says: *injured by summer heat*.
*The **to apply** (之施)* is pronounced *shī* (始豉) with the same reading below.

**[Commentary]**: Though his form holds the honor of ruling from the south,
and his majesty rests upon the noble rank of a thousand chariots,
his wrath blazes like a poisonous tiger,
humiliating all under Heaven,
there will be no pardon or reprieve.
Unless he is a great flatterer,
he cannot bear to be employed.

If a virtuous and upright man of the Dao/Way,
who could bend their heart and will to serve such a one?

**[Exegesis]**: *Who could bend* (能桡) is pronounced *niǎo* (乃孝) or *ráo* (呼毛).
Wang says: Only through supreme virtue/power and the Way can one truly subdue him;
flatterers, with their clever arguments, may only entangle him.

Thus, the Sage,
when in poverty, makes his family forget their want,
when in prosperity, makes nobles forget their rank and wealth,
and transforms them into humility.

In regard to things,
he takes joy in their harmony;
in regard to people,
he delights in their mutual understanding,
while safeguarding his own true nature.

Thus, sometimes he does not speak
yet others drink in his harmony,
or stand beside him
and are transformed by his presence.

What is fitting between father and son—
they return to their proper homes,
and he applies his virtue/power uniformly,
as Heaven and Earth do,
remaining tranquil and undivided.

His influence on human hearts is as distant as this.

Thus it is said: *Wait for the public to rest and release the King of Chu*.

**[Commentary]**: Though he blends the noble and the humble,
his proper order is never lacking,
so father and son, ruler and subject,
each occupy their proper station,
with none encroaching upon another—
is this not fitting?

His virtue/power, applied like the seasons,
is ever tranquil and undivided,
unhurried and at ease.

**[Exegesis]**: *One tranquil* (一闲) is pronounced *xián* (闲).

**[Commentary]**: His acts of benevolence,
in harmony with the four seasons,
are never rushed or forced—
his movements are undivided.

**[Exegesis]**: *And they drink* (而饮) is pronounced *yǐn* (于鸩).

**[Commentary]**: He spreads his virtue/power like a canopy over all beings,
and merges with the boundless sky.
The harmonious Dao/Way,
each finds their own fulfillment,
returning with contentment—
why should they labor under instruction?

**[Commentary]**: The Sage attains the ultimate subtlety,
completing the unity of all things,
yet remains unaware of it—
this is their nature.

Returning to the original command,
they shake off worldly concerns,
and take Heaven as their teacher;
others then follow their lead.

Though they worry about knowledge,
their actions are ever constant—
how could they ever stop?

**[Commentary]**: *Attains the ultimate subtlety* (达绸缪) refers to **Xuāntōng** (玄通).

**[Commentary]**: *Gliding and binding* (绸缪) means *interwoven and profound*.
The Sage who has reached the Dao/Way,
detached and liberated,
knowing the emptiness of all phenomena,
would never be ensnared by worldly entanglements!

The Sage of Rest, though not yet fully attuned to the Dao/Way,
thus merely leans upon it to speak of it.

**[Commentary]**: *Gliding and binding* (绸缪) is akin to *entwining and lingering* (缠绵).
Or it may also mean *profound and mysterious* (深奥).

**[Commentary]**: *Returning with contentment* (周尽一体) is the mirror of *attaining the ultimate subtlety* (玄通).
The refined and coarse are thoroughly illuminated—
thus it is said that all things are unified in harmony.
*Unity* (一体), here, refers to *Heaven* (天).

**[Commentary]**: *Yet remains unaware of it* (而不知其然) is the natural essence—
how else could it be?

**[Commentary]**: *Shaking* (摇) means self-shaking,
*acting* (作) means self-acting—
all return to their original command
and take their *Heavenly nature* (天然) as their teacher.

**[Commentary]**: This is not to seek fame
nor to elevate their reputation.
Their *nature* (性) moves them,
and their deeds naturally rise—
thus others cannot bestow a name upon them.

**[Commentary]**: *Command* (命), here, is *name* (名).
The Sage who aligns with the Dao/Way
has no name by origin,
yet since there is dust to be admired,
others follow and name them.

**[Commentary]**: *Their actions are ever constant* (忧乎知而所行恒无几时)
—though they fret over knowledge—
their deeds never cease,
and their worries never end.
How could they ever abandon knowledge
and cease from worry?
It is not possible!

**[Correction]**: (1) *Worldly concerns* (世德堂) reads *inner and outer* (内外).
(2) *Leader* (帅) follows the *Worldly Concerns* (世德堂) edition.
(3) *While* (而) follows the *Zhao Jianyi* (赵谏议) edition.

A thing born beautiful—
if others do not tell of its beauty,
then it remains unknown to people.

Whether they know it or do not know it,
whether they hear of it or do not hear of it,
its beauty is everlasting—
thus people’s delight in it is everlasting,
by *nature* (性).

The Sage’s love for people—
if others do not name it,
then it remains unknown to people.

Whether they know it or do not know it,
whether they hear of it or do not hear of it,
the Sage’s love for people is everlasting—
thus people’s trust in it is everlasting,
by *nature* (性).

**[Commentary]**: *Mirror* (鉴) is a mirror,
which reflects without partiality—
thus people admire its beauty.
Now, does the mirror know it reflects?
If a thing is born worthy of reflection,
then people simply call it a mirror.
If people do not tell of its beauty,
then none know it is beautiful to people—
just as the Sage is named by others.

**[Commentary]**: *Mirror* (鉴) is indeed a mirror.
*Tell* (告) means to speak.
Heaven’s creation is clear and luminous,
illuminating all things without partiality.
People admire and revere it,
thus it is called a mirror.
If people do not speak of its luminosity,
the mirror itself has no name.
This is the beginning of the analogy.

**[Commentary]**: *Its beauty is everlasting* (不知其美于人)
—though born with the capacity to reflect all things without thought—
people name it a mirror,
thus they admire its beauty.
If they do not speak of it,
then none know its beauty to people.

**[Commentary]**: *Everlasting* (终无已) means *never ceasing*.
The mirror’s reflection of things
is rooted in its *nature* (性),
not in whether people know or do not know,
hear or do not hear—
it reflects all that comes before it,
thus its illumination is everlasting.
If the mirror’s reflection depended on knowledge or hearing,
then it would sometimes fail or rest.
How could it endure in reflection?
Only because its luminous gaze is boundless,
thus it is beloved by all.

**[Commentary]**: *If by nature it is not beloved* (若性所不好),
how could it endure in reflection?

**[Commentary]**: The mirror’s ability to reflect
arises from its *Heavenly nature* (天然).
People’s delight in it
comes from the *造物* (造物, the Creative).
Since it is not contrived by nature,
thus its reflection is boundless.

**[Commentary]**: *Delight in it* (好之) is pronounced *hào-bào* (呼报).
Same as above.

**[Commentary]**: The Sage’s love is like a mirror—
yet through deeds for things,
people name it.
If people do not speak of it,
then none know the Sage’s love for people.

**[Commentary]**: The Sage’s benevolence extends to all under Heaven,
and their kindness flows through all generations.
All things benefit from their virtue,
and people name them accordingly.
When mutual admiration is expressed,
the title arises naturally.

If it is not thus by nature, how could there be the name of Sagehood?

**[Five]**: The Sage treats the common people as mere fodder and horses, yet their Dao aligns with loving all—thus they act without end. If love arises from being known, then it would sometimes wane.

**[Commentary]**: The Sage’s virtue is vast and boundless, their interactions with all things are without self-interest, and their benevolence pervades all living beings. The common people are but fodder and horses—how could they wait for recognition before loving them? It is because their compassion and salvation are without bias that their virtue knows no limits. This is a metaphor.

**[Six]**: What is beloved by nature endures long. **[Commentary]**: "Beloved" (安) is steadfastness. The tranquil aligns with the virtue of *yin*, the active with the waves of *yang*—thus they have no contrivance in motion or stillness. Hence, they can shatter mountains with swift thunder yet remain unshaken, stir the seas with mighty winds yet feel no alarm; this is the natural course of their true nature. If they contrive their nature and feign their emotions, then they would sometimes falter. Thus Wang Bi says: "If they do not align with their true nature, how could they long endure their aspirations?"

When gazing upon their former lands and cities, it is a joyful sight. **[One]**: Though even the humble grass and trees of the hills and valleys are left in their place, those who enter would find them still joyful. **[Two]**: How much more so for those who see and hear them! With a ten-*ren* high platform, they overlook the idle masses!

**[Commentary]**: The joy of recovering what was lost is as nothing compared to the joy of returning to one’s true nature. **[One]**: The former lands and cities are a metaphor for their true nature. Those who lose their homeland early in life, wandering in foreign towns, upon returning gaze at their ancestral roots with joyful delight. How much more so when, after long neglect of the Dao and pursuit of trivialities, they now return to their original Way—thus the joy is boundless.

**[Release]**: *Joyful sight* (畅然) is the appearance of delight.
**[Two]**: *Hemmed* (缗) means "to gather."
**[Release]**: *The hemmed* (之缗) is pronounced *zhī-niǎn* (民忍反), with the Xu reading as *hūn*. Guo says: "To gather." Sima says: "To flourish."

「**[Three]**
**[Commentary]**: To see what one has seen before, to hear what one has heard before—yet still to feel that boundless joy—how much greater the delight when one embodies the *ti-yong* and actualizes one’s true nature!

**[Exegesis]**: *Hemmed* (缗), meaning "to gather." The old homeland and capital, long abandoned, now lie in ruin—mounds and ravines obscure the land, overgrown with tangled brush. When travelers enter and seek one another out, nine out of ten are recognized; they see what they once saw, hear what they once heard, and the emotion of reunion swells with unbridled joy. How much more so when, after long abandoning the Dao, lost in the cycle of birth and death, one suddenly returns to the original source, reuniting with the True Origin and returning to the Realm of Supreme Mystery, gazing upon the Ultimate Dao—what joy could surpass this? What words could suffice to describe it?

**[Release]**: *"Nineteen"* refers to the nine recognized out of ten.
*"See-see, hear-hear"* means "what one has seen, what one has heard."
◎ **Yu Yü** says: The character *缗*, in the *Release*, cites Sima as saying "to flourish," and Guo as saying "to gather"—both interpretations are valid. The phrase *"入之者十九"* ("nineteen entering") is unclear in the *Release*, which states "nine recognized out of ten." But *"入"* here means "to enter the obscured depths of mounds and brush." If nineteen out of twenty enter unseen, then only one in ten remains visible—yet even then, they feel that joyful delight. Thus, it follows with *"how much more so when seeing what was once seen and hearing what was once heard!"* Guo’s commentary—*"to see what one has seen before, to hear what one has heard before, yet still to feel that boundless joy"*—makes the subsequent clause *"how much more so"* redundant, leading him to add *"how much more so when embodying the *ti-yong* and actualizing one’s nature!"*—a departure from Zhuangzi’s original intent.

**[Four]**
**[Commentary]**: What the multitude habitually does, though perilous, feels effortless—how much more so for the Sage, who knows no danger!

**[Exegesis]**: A *ren* is seven *chi*. A platform ten-*ren* high is perilously lofty, yet crowds ascend without fear. Habit shapes nature, and even such heights feel unburdened. How much more at ease is one who has attained the True Way—where could they not find peace?

**[Release]**: *"Tai-xian"* (台县) is pronounced *xuán*.
*"Crowd-ease"* (众闲) is pronounced *xián*.」

**[Commentary]**: Same as before. The *Yuanjia* edition reads *xián* [闲].

**[Annotation]**: Yu Yüeh says: This follows the clause *"seeing what one sees, hearing what one hears."* A ten-*ren* platform suspended before the eyes of the crowd—this is what all share in seeing and hearing, not like the obscure hills and grassy thickets where only one in ten passes through. Its boundless joy is thus self-evident.

Guo Xiang’s note says: *"What the multitude habitually does, though perilous, feels effortless."* This mistakenly reads *jiàn* [间] as *xián* [闲], rendering the meaning utterly incoherent. It stems from failing to grasp the passage above, thus missing its intent here.

**[Family Tradition]**: The *Shuowen Jiezi* defines *xián* [闲] as *"gap."* In the *Zhouli*, the artisans speak of *jǐngxián* [井闲], *chéngxián* [成闲], and *tóngxián* [同闲]—all referring to empty spaces. A ten-*ren* platform suspended in the crowd’s open expanse stands out boldly, visible to all who see and hear, beyond concealment.

To attain the *huánzhōng* [环中] and follow its completion—without forcing it outward but finding it within—one may then respond to the boundless.

**Rán Xiàngshì** attained the *huánzhōng* and followed its completion **[1]**, thus having no end nor beginning, no moment nor time **[2]**. He who daily transforms with things is yet one who does not transform **[3]**, never abandoning it **[4]!**

To imitate Heaven yet fail to imitate Heaven **[5]**, to perish with all things—how then does one conduct affairs **[6]**?

The Sage has never had Heaven, never had humanity, never had a beginning, never had things **[7]**, yet moves with the world without decay. His path is complete yet uncarved **[8]**, how does he harmonize with it?

Tang obtained his *sīyù* [司御] and *mén yǐn* [门尹], with Dēng Héng as his tutor **[9]**, learning from his teacher without constraint **[10]**, attaining the *suíchéng* [随成]. He governed by its name **[11]**, the name surpassing law, attaining its dual manifestation **[12]**. Zhòngní’s exhaustive deliberation served as his tutor **[13]**.

The **Róngchéngshì** said: *"Without days, there are no years **[14]**; without inner or outer **[15]."**

---
**[1] [Commentary]**: Rán Xiàngshì was an ancient Sage-King. Dwelling in emptiness, he followed things, and they formed spontaneously.
**[Exegesis]**: Rán Xiàngshì was the pre-*Sān Huáng* [Three Sovereigns] Emperor of Non-Action. *Huán* refers to the void within. The ancient Sage-King attained the True Void, embodying the mystery of the *huánzhōng*, thus his Dao flowed with all life, blending into all things.
**[Release]**: *Rán Xiàng* [冉相] is pronounced *xīliàng*. Commentary same as before. Guo says: Rán Xiàngshì was an ancient Sage-King.
**[Annotation]**: Yu Yüeh: The *Lùshǐ* [路史] *Xún Fěi Jì* [循蜚纪] records Rán Xiàngshì.

**[2] [Commentary]**: Suddenly moving with them.
**[Exegesis]**: No beginning means no past; no end means no future. No moment, no time means no present. Body and transformation merge, moving with things, thus transcending the three times.

**[3] [Commentary]**: Daily transforming with things, he remains ever without self, ever without self, thus ever untransformed.
**[Exegesis]**: Aligning with daily renewal, transforming with things, he moves yet remains still, thus his stillness is the unchanging Dao, towering yet unmoved.

**[4] [Commentary]**: Why does the artificer not simply abandon what he does?
**[Exegesis]**: *Hé* [阖], why? The void-attainer merges with creation, through myriad changes yet moving with transformation—never has he momentarily separated!

**[Release]**: *Chángshě* [尝舍] is pronounced *shě*. Commentary same as before.

「**[5] [Commentary]**: Only when one has no master does one attain to *shī* [師] the Heaven.
**[Exegesis]**: *Shī* [師] means to imitate; *tiān* [天] refers to the natural. The Great Clod [大块] in its spontaneous creation moves according to its inherent nature. If one deliberately seeks to learn from it, one strays from the natural, and thus fails. Hence, one attains only when there is no mastering.

**[6] [Commentary]**: Even when imitating Heaven, one still cannot escape *jùn* [殉], how much less worthy is this pursuit! Imitating Heaven is not even worthy of being called *shì* [事], let alone not imitating at all!
**[Exegesis]**: *Jùn* [殉] means to follow, to pursue. One who deliberately imitates creation and moves with things is not acting in accordance with his original nature—how can this be considered cultivating his true path? Moreover, since he still has desires, this is indeed *jùn* [殉]. If imitating is already called *jùn* [殉], then what of abandoning oneself to follow things? How can this be the Dao?

**[Release]**: *Jiē jùn* [皆殉] is pronounced *jùn* [殉] (with the *shǔn* [俊] rhyme).
◎The Master’s father said: His cessation is in harmony with fate; his actions respond to things; his abandonment is the fulfillment of nature and return to the original, blending into the world without trace. The phrase *"How can this be the Dao?"* means this is the very way of the Dao.

**[7] [Exegesis]**: The one who attains the Central Sage [中圣人] comprehends ultimate truth, thus able to dispel both Heaven and human affairs, and forget the self and things. Since it is said there is no end, when did it ever have a beginning? Moving with nature and merging with the Dao, he no longer imitates Heaven.

**[8] [Commentary]**: Only when all is abandoned does one attain *mínghé* [冥合].
**[Exegesis]**: *Tì* [替] means to discard, to obstruct. Blending indistinguishably with human affairs and proceeding alongside the world, he adapts to things with the times, never neglecting or failing. Yet he endures the world’s vicissitudes, fully experiencing them, yet never obstructed—all encounters are harmonized, without contrived imitation of the Dao. How can one, through imitation, seek to align with truth? It is utterly impossible.

**[Release]**: *Suǒxíng zhī bèi ér bù yì* [所行之备而不洫] is pronounced *yì* [洫] (with the *yì* [溢] rhyme).*」

「Guō Xǔ’s rebellion and Lǐ Xūyù’s rebellion were both *làn* [滥].
Wang Yún: *huài bài* [坏败]—ruin and decay.
Without contrivance, proceeding in harmony, where could one not arrive? Hence it is said: all are *xùn* [殉]—all are fulfilled.
What is done is fully realized, yet self and things remain unharmed—thus there is no ruin or decay.

**[9] [Commentary]**: Entrusting it to the hundred officials yet taking no part in it.
**[Exegesis]**: Surname: Guō; given name: Yǐn. *(Also)*: The title *Ményǐn* [门尹] is an office; surname: Dēng; given name: Héng.
The sage of the Shang, Yīn Tāng, with a heart unburdened and yielding to things, thus obtained worthy ministers to govern affairs. Though he served as their teacher and guide, he remained in silent repose, doing nothing himself.

**[Release]**: *Ményǐn Dēng Héng* [门尹登恒]—some say *Ményǐn* is an official title, *Dēng Héng* are personal names.
*Wéi zhī* [为之]—pronounced with the *wěi* [伪] rhyme. Same below.
*Fù zhī* [傅之]—pronounced *fù* [付]. Same below.
*Bù yǔ* [不与]—pronounced *yù* [预].

**[10] [Commentary]**: Allowing them to gather naturally, not confining them; letting them disperse naturally, not dissolving them.
**[Exegesis]**: *Cóng* [从]—to entrust.
*Yòu* [囿]—to gather.
With effortless simplicity and non-action, he entrusted his ministers, never accumulating merit as his own.

**[11] [Commentary]**: Even those under the *Sīyù* [司御] officials could follow things in their natural course, yet Tāng obtained them—thus his name was entrusted to things, while his achievements belonged to none but himself.
**[Exegesis]**: Worthy ministers, entrusted with their tasks, accomplished them in accordance with things, their merit attributed to the *Sīyù* officials—his name lay not in himself.

**[12] [Commentary]**: *Míngfǎ* [名法] are merely traces of what has passed—no more than sufficient.
Hence it is said: the effortlessly detached, entrusting governance to the officials, thus his name and traces appear in them alone.
**[Exegesis]**: *Yīngrán* [嬴然]—effortless detachment.
*Jiàn* [见]—to manifest. *Xiǎn* [显]—to reveal.

The completion of things’ names and the sage’s traces as law,
both belong to the teacher and minister—yet he does not partake therein.
Thus the two matters of *name* and *law* are both revealed in them,
effortlessly detached and leisurely released—achievement accomplished yet not claimed.

**[Exegesis]**
*The name of things* (*chéngwù zhī míng*): *Yīng* [嬴]—resonant, full.
*Law* (*fǎ*): *Liánjiàn* [两见]—mutually manifest, as in *lián* [连] and *jiàn* [见].
[Commentary] He attains the *Dao* of spontaneous completion to govern their names—
when *name* and *substance* align, the law is established, hence their mutual manifestation,
just as a mirror’s reflection reveals itself.

◎ *Jiāshì Fù* [家世父] says: *Suíchéng* [随成]—*húnchéng* [浑成], undifferentiated completion;
*liángjiàn* [两见]—*duìdài* [对待], reciprocal correspondence.
*Shuōwén* [说文]: *Fù* [傅]—to assist, to align.
Thus *suíchéng* suffices as *fù*—
the *Zhòngní* [仲尼]’s exhaustive deliberation was also assistance, likewise reciprocal correspondence.
*Sī* [司]—to discern.
*The name’s resonance*, the *law’s* decline.
*Éryá Shǔgǔ* [尔雅释诂]: *Fǎ* [法]—constant.
*Lǎozǐ*: *Míng kě míng* [名可名]—the *name* that can be named, yet transcends naming.
Discerning where *name* and *trace* reach reveals their completion—hence *liángjiàn*.

*Jièzhì* [寄治]—*Zhí lì* [直吏]—direct governance.

**[13] [Commentary]**
*Zhòngní* [仲尼] said: *"What thought, what deliberation in the world!*
Deliberation has been exhausted—
if even a thread or grain of thought remains,
how could one remain serene and unmoved,
responding to all stimuli without end,
to assist the natural unfolding of all things?"

**[Exegesis]**
*Fù* [傅]—assistance.
*Jìn* [尽]—absolute cessation.
*Kǒng Qiū* [孔丘], the sage, forgot the self and severed all thought—
thus he could transform all beings,
assisting the natural endowment.
If one harbors even a thread of thought,
how could one attain *zuòwàng* [坐忘] and respond to stimuli!

**[14] [Commentary]**
Now why do we have years and days to preserve?
Because there is *sǐshēng* [死生]—life and death.
If there were no death, no life,
then the reckoning of years and days would vanish.

**[Exegesis]**
*Róngchéng* [容成], the ancient sage-king,
*suìrì* [岁日]—merely the names for temporal sequence.
To reckon time thus requires *sǐshēng*—
when life and death cease, years and days dissolve.

**[Exegesis]**
*Róngchéng* [容成]—*Lǎozǐ*’s teacher.

◎ *Yú Yì* [俞樾] says:
The *Han Shū Yìwén Zhì* [汉书艺文志] lists *Yīnyáng* [阴阳] as *Róngchéngzǐ* [容成子] with fourteen chapters,
and *Fángzhōng* [房中] as *Róngchéng Yīndào* [容成阴道] with twenty-six volumes—
this is *Lǎozǐ*’s teacher.
In *Lièzǐ Tāngwèn* [列子汤问], *Huángdì* [黄帝] dwells with *Róngchéngzǐ* [容成子] in *Kōngdòng* [空峒] for three months—
this is another.
In *Huáinán Běnjīng* [淮南本经], *Róngchéngshì* [容成氏]’s time saw geese flying in orderly rows,
babies left in nests, grain stored at field edges,
tigers and leopards tamed, serpents trodden—
yet none knew how this came to be.
This refers to the ancient sovereign,
the *Zhuāngzǐ Qùqiè* [庄子胠箧] *Róngchéngshì* [容成氏],
ranked with *Dàtíng* [大庭], *Bǒhuáng* [伯皇], *Zhōngyāng* [中央], and *Lìlù* [栗陆].
Yet *Gāo Yù* [高诱] annotates: *"Róngchéngshì* [容成氏], a *Huángdì* [黄帝] official who devised the calendar"—
thus making him *Huángdì*’s minister.
This aligns with *Lièzǐ Tāngwèn*’s *Róngchéngzǐ* [容成子] dwelling with *Huángdì* [黄帝] in *Kōngdòng* [空峒],
but not this *Róngchéng* [容成].
Examining all accounts, *Róngchéngshì* [容成氏] appears in three forms:
the sovereign of *Huángdì* [黄帝], first;
*Huángdì*’s minister, second;
*Lǎozǐ*’s teacher, third.
Yet *Lǎozǐ*’s birth year remains unverifiable—
his teacher may well have been *Huángdì*’s minister.

**[15] [Commentary]**
Without *bǐwǒ* [彼我], there is no *nèiwài* [内外].

**[Exegesis]**
*Nèi* [内]—*wǒ* [我].
*Wài* [外]—*wù* [物].
To reckon *sǐshēng* [死生] creates *nèi* [内] as name.
When years and days are abandoned, *wǒ* and *wù*—what use remain?

**[Collation]**
(1) The *zhī* [之] character deleted per *Fù Sòngběn* [覆宋本] and *Wáng Shūbǐn* [王叔岷]’s suggestion.
(2) *Shìdètáng* [世德堂] edition reads *ér* [而] as *ěr* [耳].

Wei Ying and Duke Mou of Tian formed an alliance, but Duke Mou betrayed him. Enraged, Wei Ying prepared to send an assassin to kill him **[1]**.

**[1] [Exegesis]**
Ying was the given name of Duke Hui of Wei. Duke Mou of Tian was none other than King Wei of Qi, whose name was Mou, son of Duke Huan of Qi, a descendant of Tian Heng, hence "Duke of Tian." The two states of Wei and Qi had sworn an alliance, pledging not to wage war upon each other. After the alliance was made, not long passed before King Wei betrayed it, so Duke Hui of Wei, furious, prepared to send an assassin to kill him. Their alliance was formed in the twenty-sixth year of King Wei of Qi and the eighth year of Duke Hui of Wei.

**[Textual Notes]**
The character *魏罃* (*Wei Ying*) is rendered *罃* in Guo’s edition, pronounced *yīng* (as in *yīngmó*), but modern texts mostly use *莹*. Pronounced *yìgēng* (乙耕反).
Sima Qian notes that this refers to Duke Hui of Wei.
◎ Lu Wenbian remarks: The original alternated between *罃* and *莹*, but the latter is more consistent with modern texts, so it is corrected here. The *Shiji* records Duke Hui of Wei’s name as *罃*.
The phrase *与田侯* is sometimes written as *与田侯牟*.
Sima Qian states: Duke of Tian refers to King Wei of Qi, named Mou, son of Duke Huan.
However, the *Shiji* records King Wei’s name as *Yin*, not *Mou*.
◎ Lu Wenbian notes: The text contains the character *牟*, but the *Shiji* and *Zhan Guo Ce* both record King Wei’s name as *Yin*.
◎ Yu Yue remarks: The *Shiji* records King Wei’s name as *Yin*. There is no Tian Qi ruler named *Mou*, though Duke Huan’s name was *Wu* (午), which may be a corruption of *Mou*. However, Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Hui of Wei were not contemporaries.
The phrase *背之* is pronounced *pèi*.
*Sà zhī* (刺之) is pronounced *qī cì* (七赐反).

Public Sun Yan (Jixiu) heard of this and was ashamed, saying:
“Your Highness is a sovereign of ten thousand chariots, yet you act like a commoner seeking vengeance against a personal enemy! Let me take command of twenty thousand armored soldiers to attack them. I will plunder their people, seize their cattle and horses **[2]**, and make their ruler’s internal heat erupt from his back. Then we will take their state. If he flees, I will strike his back and break his spine.”

「**[3]** **[1]** **[Explanation]**
The *Xīshǒu* (犀首) was an official title—akin to modern *Hǔbēn* (虎贲) officers. This was the name given to a scion of the ruling house, here Public Sun Yan (公孙衍). The term *"million-chariot sovereign"* (万乘之君) refers to a feudal lord whose realm fielded ten thousand chariots. *"Mǐfú"* (匹夫) denotes an ordinary man, one without official rank, paired only with his spouse. *"Cóng chóu"* (从雠) means to retaliate against an enemy, as in avenging a grudge.

For a sovereign to act thus—where one wronged party should command armies of twenty thousand armored soldiers to crush his foe, plunder his people, and seize his livestock—yet instead sends a lone commoner to assassinate him in secret, is unworthy of a lord of ten thousand chariots. Hence, it is shameful.

**[Textual Notes]**
*The Xīshǒu* (犀首) was an official title of the State of Wei. Sima Qian compares it to modern *Hǔyá Jiāngjūn* (虎牙将军). Public Sun Yan held this office. The *Yuánjiā* variant reads *Chǐshǒu* (齿首). *[Regional Annotation]* The *Zhànguó Cè* (战国策) cites Sima Qian’s note: *"Xīshǒu"* was a Wei official title, akin to today’s *Hǔyá Jiāngjūn* (虎牙将军). The *Shìwén* (释文) is more concise.

*"Wànshèng"* (万乘) is pronounced *shéngzhèng* (绳证反).

**[2]** **[Explanation]**
General Sun Yan requested sole command, bearing the *yuè* (钺) axe of authority, to lead twenty thousand armored soldiers in assaulting the Qi capital. Victory was assured. He would then plunder the populace, seize their cattle and horses, and distribute spoils among the troops as rewards.

**[Textual Notes]**
*"Wèi jūn"* (为君) is pronounced *wéiwěi* (于伪反). The lower *"qǐng wèi jūn"* (请为君) aligns with the preceding context.»

**[3] [Exegesis]**
Clan-name Tian, given-name Ji, a general of Qi.
*Lǐ* (抶) and *zhé* (折) mean "to strike."
With his state ruined and his people scattered, his resentment smoldered within—his *qi* seethed in his heart, and a festering boil erupted upon his back.
His kingdom having fallen and his lordly general captured, he struck and crushed his back, shattered his spine and waist, then turned his army to present a triumphant report.
Was it not exhilarating?

**[Textual Notes]**
*"Ji yě chūzǒu"* (忌也出走): Ji fled in fear. Some say he was besieged.
The *Yuánjiā* variant reads *wáng* (亡) for *ji* (忌).
*"Lǐ"* (抶) is pronounced *chì-yī* (敕一反).
The *Sān Cāng* (三苍) glosses it as "to strike."
Guo [Yiwen] (郭) notes: *"Zhì"* (秩), also pronounced *zhū-lì* (猪栗反).
◎ Lu Wenfu (卢文弨) remarks: The original *zhì* (秩) was mistakenly written as *lǐ* (抶). Now following the internal phonetic glosses, we adopt *zhì*.
Some doubt it may be *zhì* (柣), though it too is not glossed as "to strike."
*"Zhé qí"* (折其) is pronounced *zhé-shé* (之舌反).

**[Collation]**
**(1)** The three characters *Gōngsūn Yǎn* (公孙衍) are supplemented according to the exegesis and Zhao Jianyi’s (赵谏议) text.
**(2)** The character *guān* (官) is supplemented from the *Guó Cè* (国策) Baoshu (鲍注).

Jìzǐ, hearing this, was ashamed and said:
"To build a city ten *rèn* high, yet once it stands ten *rèn* tall, to then demolish it—this is the laborers’ misery.
Now seven years have passed without raising arms—this is the king’s foundation.
Yǎn disrupts the people; he must not be heeded."

**[Annotations]**
**(1)**
Jì (季), a surname; Zǐ (子), a title of virtue. A worthy minister of the State of Wèi.
*Xūmǐ* (胥靡), forced laborers.
Jìzǐ, holding to the Dao, opposed warfare. Upon hearing Xīshǒu (犀首) request arms, he was ashamed and offered counsel.
To build a city seven *rèn* high—this is no small labor. Once the walls stand seven *rèn* tall, to then demolish them would be to waste the toil of the laborers. This is a metaphorical illustration.

**[Exegesis]**
*Jìzǐ* (季子): A minister of Wèi.
◎ Yú Yì (俞樾) remarks: The following ten characters likely contain a scribal error—"seven" (*qī*) instead of "ten" (*shí*). If the walls are already seven *rèn* high, they are nearly ten *rèn*—thus, their destruction would be regrettable. If they were already ten *rèn*, one would simply say they were complete; there would be no need to specify "already ten *rèn*." The later text states, *"Now seven years have passed without raising arms—this is the king’s foundation,"* clearly using seven as a metaphor for seven years. The error in the character is undoubted.
*"Again demolish"* (*yòu huǐ*): Pronounced *guài* (怪).

**(2)**
With arms laid down for seven years, the king’s foundation of peace is established. Xīshǒu now stirs strife—he must not be heeded.

Huá Zǐ (华子), hearing this, was disgusted and said:
"Those who advocate attacking Qí are troublemakers;
Those who advocate not attacking are also troublemakers;
And those who claim that either attacking or not attacking causes trouble—these too are troublemakers."

**[Annotations]**
Huá (华), a surname; Zǐ (子), a title of virtue. Another worthy minister of Wèi.

Those who cleverly advocate attacking Qí—meaning they stir up arms and conflict—are indeed agents of chaos, such as Gōngsūn Yuān.

Those who cleverly advocate not attacking—though their intent lies in preserving the king’s foundation of virtue and surpassing rival states—still harbor expectations of relief, and thus are also agents of chaos, as was Jì Zǐ.

Those who claim that either attacking or not attacking causes chaos—these have not yet forgotten the Dao of speech and action, still clinging to judgments of right and wrong, and thus cannot escape being agents of chaos. These are the words of Huá Zǐ speaking of himself.

**[Annotations]**
Huá Zǐ was also a minister of Wèi.

The king said: *"Then what should be done?"*

Huá Zǐ replied: *"The king need only seek the Dao!"*

The king, hearing this, summoned Dài Jìnrén.

Dài Jìnrén said: *"There is something called a snail—have you heard of it?"*

The king replied: *"Yes."*

Dài Jìnrén said: *"The snail is indeed a minuscule creature, yet it possesses two horns. Have you heard of this?"*

The king replied: *"Yes."* (Dài Jìnrén continued:)
*"There are nations dwelling upon the snail’s left horn called the Zhù Shì, and upon its right horn called the Mán Shì. They frequently wage war over this land, with countless dead, and retreat for fifteen days before returning. Have you heard of this?"*

The king sighed: *"Ah! Is this not mere idle talk?"*

Dài Jìnrén responded: *"Your servant requests to verify this for Your Majesty. Does Your Majesty suppose that the four directions—up and down—have any bounds?"*

The king said: *"None."* (Dài Jìnrén continued:)
*"If one knows how to wander freely beyond all bounds, yet remains within the realm of the civilized—does such a state exist or not?"*

The mind wanders within the boundless expanse—
when compared to the Nine Regions and their isles,
speaking of their vastness and smallness,
one might say they are as if present, as if absent.

The king said: *"Indeed."*

*"Within the realm of the civilized lies the State of Wei,*
*and within Wei lies the State of Liang,*
*and within Liang lies the King.*
*Between the King and the barbarian tribes—*
*is there any distinction?"*

The king said: *"None."*

*"A single state, positioned within the six directions,
when discussing its vastness or smallness,
is as if present, as if absent.
What difference lies between it and those barbarian tribes?
This is a fitting analogy.*

The king said: *"No distinction."*

*"The King and the barbarian tribes are but limited beings.
If limited, then regardless of size,
they cannot compare to the boundless.
Even heaven and earth, though within the boundless,
are as nothing.
How much more so Wei within Liang,
and the King within Wei—
that they should contend!"*

When the guest departed, the king stood in bewilderment,
as if something had been lost.

The guest left, and Huizi entered.
The king said: *"The guest was a great sage—
even the Sage cannot match him."*

Huizi said:
*"Blowing through a bamboo flute still produces a resonant sound,
but blowing through a sword’s hilt yields only a faint puff.
Emperor Yao and Shun are praised by the world,
yet discussing the Dao of Yao and Shun before this guest
is like that faint puff—
barely worth hearing."*

「The character *sè* (《嗃》), pronounced *xiào* (許交反), refers to a resonant sound from a bamboo pipe.
The *Yùpiàn* (玉篇) gives alternate pronunciations: *hūluò* (呼洛反) and *jiào* (呼教反).
The *Guǎngyǎ* (廣雅) defines it as "to resound."

The term *jiànshǒu* (《剑首》), as explained by Sima [Bian], refers to the small hole at the top of a sword’s hilt.

The character *xū* (《吷》), pronounced *xuè* (音血), also read as *yuè* (呼悦反), is described by Sima as a faint sound, like wind passing.

The phrase *suǒyù* (《所誉》) is pronounced *yú* (音余).

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at a seller of *jiāng* (浆) at the foot of Ant Hill [丘].
His neighbors, including husbands, wives, servants, and concubines, all ascended to the rooftops.
Zilu asked: *"What are these crowds doing?"*

---
**Annotations in text:**
[一] *Ant Hill [丘]*: A hill named after its location. *Jiāng* (浆) refers to a family selling water.
[二] *Crowds ascending*: *Jí* (极) means "high" or "rooftop." The disciples of Confucius, with their grand procession, drew the attention of the neighbors, who gathered to observe him. Zilu, unfamiliar with the scene, questioned it in bewilderment.

---
Confucius replied:
*"They are the servants of a sage.
He hides himself among the people,
conceals himself at the riverside."*

Confucius replied:
*"They are the servants of a sage.
He hides himself among the people,
conceals himself at the riverside."*

---

Yet his fame is diminished,
his purpose boundless,
though his lips speak,
his heart never truly does.
He stands apart from the world,
yet his mind does not deign to follow it.

Is this the hidden one of the people,
the *Yíliáo* of the Market South?
---

[三] His reputation fades, [四]
his Dao/Way endless—
though his mouth utters words,
his heart never truly speaks.
He opposes the world’s ways,
yet his spirit does not stoop to its company.

Is this the recluse among men,
the *Yíliáo* of Market South?
---

[一] Already! [二]
He knows I am attached to him,
knows I am bound for Chu,
and assumes I must now summon him at the behest of the Chu King.
Yet he would take me for a flatterer!

If such were the case,
he would shrink from hearing even my words—
how much more so from seeing my person in truth!
Yet why would he still remain? [五]

---

[**One**]
**[Explanation]** *Yǐ*, to stop. He will not come—better to cease calling him.

[**Two**]
**[Annotation]** *Zhuó*, to make clear.

[**Three**]
**[Explanation]** *Bǐ*, referring to *Yíliáo*. *Zhuó*, to make clear. He knows I recognize *Yíliáo* as a scholar of the *Lùshēn* lineage, and that upon arriving in Chu, I would surely recommend him to the Chu King. Thus, he would take me for a flatterer.

[**Four**]
**[Explanation]** The people of *Lùshēn* are naturally sincere and upright. They would be ashamed to hear the words of deceit, let alone see its bearer in truth—this is not what they desire.

[**Five**]
**[Annotation]** It would be better to abandon him and let him follow his own will.
**[Explanation]** *Ér*, thou. *Cún*, to remain. Why hide and flee for so long, yet you still ask to summon him, as if he were still there? Child, you went to see him—his dwelling was empty.

**[One]**
**[Annotation]** Indeed, he had fled.
**[Explanation]** Zhòngyóu lacked discernment, ignoring his teacher’s words, and went to his home to observe his great virtue. Though his plea to invite him was earnest, *Yíliáo* had already escaped, and his house stood empty.

The *Chángwú* boundary-keeper asked Zǐláo:
“When governing, do not act recklessly; when tending the people, do not neglect them.
Once, I cultivated grain—if I plowed recklessly, the harvest would be wild and unyielding; if I weeded carelessly, the grain would be stunted and broken.
The next year, I changed my ways: I deepened the plowing and carefully hoed, and the grain grew lush, filling my granaries until the year’s end.”

**[One]**
**[Annotation]** *Lǔmǎng mièliè*—to act hastily or to neglect meticulous care, failing to fulfill one’s duty.
**[Explanation]** *Chángwú*, a place name, so called for its tall *wú* trees. The boundary-keeper, also the local guardian of the region. Zǐláo, a disciple of Confucius, of the Qín clan, from the *Sòng* [or *Qīng*] lineage. *Zhìzhèng*, to govern and transform. *Zhìmín*, to administer and nurture.

Recklessness (*lǔmǎng*) is the failure to apply one’s mind.
Negligence (*mièliè*) is frivolity.

The people are the root of a state—when the root is firm, the state is at peace. One must attend to their nurturing with care, yet must not treat them lightly with idle disturbance. The boundary-keeper understood this Dao.

Thus, he warned Zǐláo.

---
**[Exegesis]**
*Chángwú* [Long Willow]—a place name.
The boundary-keeper, the guardian of the borderlands.
*Zǐláo*—According to Sima [Bian], this is Qín Láo, a disciple of Confucius by the name of Zhāng. Regrettably, scholars have conflated him with Qín Zhāng, a disciple mentioned in *The Family Sayings of Confucius*—a text falsely attributed to King Zǐyōng—and thus misidentified him. Jiā Qú and Zhèng Qóng, in their annotations on the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, took him to be Zhuan Sūn Shī, but Fú Qiàn refuted this, noting that Zǐzhāng was forty years younger than Confucius, who was forty at the time. Zhào Xī, in his *Mencius* commentary, also equated him with Qín Zhāng, citing *The Records of Ritual*’s mention of Zǐzhāng after mourning rites, though this is speculative. The confusion arises from shallow scholarship. The *Han Book of Ancient and Modern Worthies* lists him as Qín Láo, further evidence of textual corruption.

---
*Lǔmǎng*—pronounced *lǔ* (as in *lǔ* "lukewarm").
*Mǎng*—*mògǔ* rhyme, also read as the character itself.
*Mièliè*—like short grass, as Lǐ [Xún] suggests, meaning "unrefined." Guō [Yǎng] elaborates: recklessness and negligence are frivolity, failing to fulfill one’s duty. Sima [Bian] defines *lǔmǎng* as "roughness," referring to shallow plowing and sparse sowing, while *mièliè* means "severing the grass."

---
**[Annotation]**
*Lǔ*—*chūnqiū* rhyme.
*Mǎng*—*cāigǔ* rhyme; the two characters were often paired in antiquity, as seen in *Spring and Autumn Elucidations* ("beginning with roughness, ending in subtlety") and *Balancing Discourses* ("roughly outlining the main topic"). Some later scholars mistakenly altered *mǎng* to *sū*, but this is incorrect.

---
**[Exegesis]**
*Fù*—to plant grain.
*Yùn*—weeding, removing grass.
Shallow plowing and careless weeding lead to meager harvests—this is the consequence of neglect.

---
**[Annotation]**
Diligence in fulfilling one’s duty, the pinnacle of *wu-wei* [non-action].

---
**[Exegesis]**
*Biàn*—to change, refine.
*Qí*—to regulate, harmonize.
*Sōu*—to hoe, cultivate.
Last year’s reckless farming brought famine; this year, he altered his methods—deep plowing, meticulous weeding—so the grain flourished, filling the granaries by year’s end.

---
*Zhuāngzi* heard this and said:

*"Now, when people govern their bodies and regulate their minds, many fall into the boundary-keeper’s error—
suppressing their nature, severing their essence, extinguishing their feelings, and losing their spirit, all to conform to the crowd.
Thus, those who coarsen their nature—
their desires and aversions become like wild reeds and water plants,
sprouting to prop up their forms,
soon overrunning their true selves;
their boundaries collapse, their leaks unchecked—
boils, abscesses, and festering sores arise from internal heat, as does turbid urine and oily discharges."*

「【一】【Commentary】 In the present age, people are superficial and frivolous, indulging their passions and desires without restraint, until they come to govern their bodies and regulate their minds—just as the boundary-keeper does.

Zhuang Zhou heard this and thus expounded upon it.

【二】【Annotation】 The evasion, abandonment, extinction, and loss are all consequences of conforming to the crowd【一】. If each were taken to its utmost【二】, what would there be to fear?

【Commentary】 Those who evade the natural order, scatter their pure and harmonious nature, extinguish their true and genuine feelings, and forsake the Dao/Way of nurturing their spirit—all do so by yielding to external pressures and clinging too heavily to artificial constraints.

【Variant Readings】 *"離其"* (lì qí) reads as *力智反* (lì zhì fǎn). The same below. *"以眾為"* (yǐ zhòng wéi) reads as *如字* (rú zì). Wang Yi says: "The things that can be done by the crowd." Evasion, abandonment, extinction, and loss all stem from conforming to the crowd. Conforming to the crowd is what we call coarsening one’s nature. The Sima edition mistakenly reads this as *伪* (wěi).

【三】【Annotation】 Wild reeds and water plants harm millet and sorghum; desires and aversions injure one’s true nature.

【Commentary】 Wild reeds and water plants are reeds. The heart of desires and aversions often breeds perversity. Just as wild reeds and water plants harm millet and sorghum, so too do desires and aversions injure one’s true nature—all because of reckless superficiality and falsehood, which lead to such outcomes.

【Variant Readings】 *"欲惡"* (yù è) reads as *乌路反* (wū lù fǎn). The same as the annotation. *"之孽"* (zhī niè) reads as *鱼列反* (yú liè fǎn). *"萑"* (huàn) is pronounced as *丸* (wán), akin to reeds. *"苇"* (wéi) reads as *于鬼反* (yú guǐ fǎn), meaning reeds.

【四】【Annotation】 When the body’s supporting structures grow sparse, the spirit and *qi* are harmed.

【Commentary】 Wild reeds (蒹葭, *jiān jiā*), also reeds, begin as mere weeds and can still be easily removed. But once they spread and flourish, they inevitably harm millet and sorghum. Similarly, when the heart of desire first arises, it can still be easily suppressed. But once it grows rampant and deepens, restraint must be applied at the outset. Hence, Laozi says, *"Before its signs appear, it is easy to plan against it."*【Variant Readings】 *"蒹"* (jiān) reads as *古恬反* (gǔ tián fǎn), meaning *薕* (jiān). *"葭"* (jiā) is pronounced as *加* (jiā), also reeds.

◎Yu Yu notes: *"For nature’s sake, wild reeds and wild reeds"* (為性萑苇蒹葭, *wéi xìng huàn wéi jiān jiā*) is a six-character sentence. Guo Xiang’s annotation under *萑苇* (huàn wéi) states, *"Wild reeds harm the crops, desires and aversions injure one’s true nature."* This is a misreading. *"Begin to sprout to prop up my form"* (始萌以扶吾形, *shǐ méng yǐ fú wú xíng*) and *"soon overrun my true nature"* (尋擢吾性, *xún zhuó wú xìng*)—here, *尋* (xún) and *始* (shǐ) are paired in meaning, *xún* signifying "to proceed and follow through." As in the *Han Book’s* "Idols of the Sacred Mountain" (郊祀志), Jin Zhao says: *"Xún* means to follow through in one’s actions."* *"Begin to sprout to prop up my form"* speaks to how their growth initially seems sufficient to support one’s form; *"soon overrun my true nature"* speaks to how, once they have spread for long, they uproot and dominate one’s true nature. Guo Xiang’s annotation under *"扶吾形"* (fú wú xíng) reads, *"When the body’s supporting structures grow sparse, the spirit and *qi* are harmed,"*—this is also a misreading.

【五】【Annotation】 Using desires and aversions to lure one’s nature does not stop at what is proper.

【Commentary】 *Xún* means "to lure," *zhuó* means "to uproot." When one entices the heart with desires and aversions, it inevitably leads to the uprooting of one’s true nature, which does not remain within what is proper.

【六】【Annotation】 This is the retribution for coarsening one’s nature. Therefore, those who cultivate their nature must harmonize its utmost reaches!

「【Commentary】 *Kuì-lòu* refers to **cold sores** (lit. "human cold sores"). *Piāo-jū* is **hot toxin-induced swelling** (lit. "floating carbuncles"). *Jie* is also a type of **carbuncle**. *Sōu-gāo* means **leaking of semen/urine** (lit. "dribbling grease").

Indulging in sensory pleasures and drowning in sounds and colors thus leads to **mental confusion, spiritual disarray, and physical debilitation**—*qi* and form grow weak, and diseases erupt indiscriminately, regardless of time or place.

【Exegesis】 *"Bìng kuì"* reads *hui-nèi-fǎn*. Li [Fan] explains *lòu-fā* as: *"When vital *qi* dissipates and leaks—bursting above, draining below—it flows out without restraint."*

**Bó Jǔ**, a student of **Lǎo Dān**, said: *"May I roam the world?"* **[1]**

**[1] Commentary:** *Bó* is a surname; *Jǔ* is a given name. A **Daoist practitioner** and disciple of **Lǎozi**, he sought to **travel the world, observe governance, and discern human nature**.

**[Exegesis]** *"Bó Jǔ"* refers to **a virtuous, Dao-cultivating individual**. **Lǎo Dān** replied: *"Enough! The world remains as it is."**[1]

**[1] Commentary:** **Lǎozi** restrained him, forbidding his journey, declaring that **human nature and affairs differ not from this place**.

Again, **Bó Jǔ** pleaded, and **Lǎo Dān** asked: *"Where would you begin?"* **[1]**

Bó Jǔ, earnest and insistent in his plea, pressed on: *"Where shall I begin my journey?"*
*"I shall begin in Qi."* **[1]**

**[1] Commentary:** Bó Jǔ was a man of Lu, neighboring Qi. Since Qi’s governance was corrupt, he sought to begin there.

Upon arriving in Qi, he encountered a condemned man, bound for execution. He pushed aside the guards and forced the man to lie still, then removed his own formal robes to drape over the prisoner, and wept to heaven, calling out: *"Alas, my child! Alas, my child! The world has great calamities—you alone are first to suffer them, yet they say, ‘Do not steal! Do not kill!’**[2]

Only when honor and shame are established do people see their afflictions**[3]; only when wealth is amassed do they see what they contend for**[4]. Now you have set in motion the very afflictions of others and the very contests of others, driving people to ruin without respite—how could this not come to pass?"**[5]

**[1] Commentary:** Having traveled to Qi to observe its governance, he suddenly saw a condemned man about to be executed. He pushed aside the guards, forced the prisoner into a proper posture, removed his own formal robes, and covered the man’s body.

**[2] Annotation:** The great calamity of murder begins with what follows. If such calamities exist, how can mere prohibitions—‘Do not steal! Do not kill!’—avert them?

**[3] Commentary:** *Li* (離) means to suffer. *Zāi* (菑) means calamity. He called out to heaven, weeping bitterly, lamenting the injustice, hence the repeated *"Alas, my child!"* The crimes of theft and murder are the world’s greatest afflictions—why should this man alone bear them first? The conditions of these calamities are detailed below.

**[4] Alternative Explanation:** The condemned man refers to the officials of the court. They forcefully push one another to assume formal robes, layering oppressive systems upon the people, hence his lament to heaven, revealing how these calamities arise. The pretexts for these traps are laid out in the following passages.

**[5] Annotation (俞樾):** *"Alas, my child! Alas, my child!"* is an exclamatory sigh. In the *Shī Jīng*, *"Glide, my child! My child!"* (绸缪子兮子兮), the *Máo Zhuan* explains: *"Child!"* is a sigh of lament. In *Guān Zǐ*, *"Ah, this!"* (嗟兹乎) is used in the *Xiǎo Chēng Piān*, and the *Shuō Yuàn*’s *Guì Dé Piān* states: *"Ah, this! My ruin is certain!"* All treat *"Ah, this!"* as an exclamatory sigh. Further discussion is in *Jīng Yì Shù Wén*.

「This is rendered *"Alas, my child! Alas, my child!"* (子乎子乎), which carries the same meaning as *"Glide, my child! My child!"* (子兮子兮). The character **子** should be read as *"wū"* (户刀反).

The **释文** does not provide a pronunciation for **子**, having long lost its original meaning. **"哉"** (大菑之条) is read as *"zāi"* (哉), and **"离"** (离之) means *"to lose"* or *"depart from"* (着).

**[3] Commentary (注):** When each person finds what suits them, there is no distinction between honor and disgrace—gain and loss become entangled. Thus, honor and disgrace arise, and those who boast of their so-called disgrace while disdaining their so-called honor are indeed sick. **[Codicil (疏):** Honor lies in the cap and carriage (轩冕), disgrace in execution and humiliation (戮耻). The pursuit of honor and avoidance of disgrace lead to frantic competition—how can this not be a sickness!]

**[4] Commentary (注):** If one considers contentment as true wealth, what would they still strive for?

**[Codicil (疏):** When treasures pile high, the competition to acquire them begins.]

**[5] Commentary (注):** When those above indulge in certain preferences, those below cannot remain content with their proper station.

**[Codicil (疏):** They are rewarded with cap and carriage (轩冕) and entertained with pearls and jade (珠玑), yet this drives all ranks into frantic competition, leaving them exhausted and unceasing. To make them settle into their rightful stations—is this even possible?

The **释文** for **"所好"** (呼报反) reads *"hūbào."* In ancient times, rulers understood that **gain** (得) lay with the people, and **loss** (失) was their own responsibility **[1]**; **uprightness** (正) came from the people, while **wrongdoing** (枉) was their own fault **[2]**. Hence, when their form (one’s proper station) was lost, they would retreat and blame themselves **[3]**.

But now it is not so. They **hide** (匿) their faults while feigning ignorance **[5]**, making great demands yet daring not to punish **[6]**, burdening excessively while unable to bear the consequences **[7]**, and setting distant paths yet failing to reach them **[8]**. When the people see their strength exhausted, they resort to **deception** (伪) **[9]**, and with deception flourishing daily, how can the common folk (士民) avoid it **[10]!**

When strength is insufficient, deception arises; when knowledge is lacking, fraud follows; when wealth is scarce, theft emerges. The acts of theft and robbery—whom should they blame, and how can this be justified **[11]?**

**[1] Commentary (注):** If the ruler does not fail the people, then the people will naturally find what they need.

**[Codicil (疏):** They ascribe success to external forces (物), so they believe gain lies with the people. They accept the ill fortune of the state as their own responsibility, so they believe loss is their own fault.]

**[2] Commentary (注):** If the ruler does not wrong the people, then the people will naturally be upright.

**[Codicil (疏):** Without imposing burdens on the people, uprightness lies with them. When the ruler takes responsibility for his own mistakes and blames himself, wrongdoing is his own fault.]

**[3] Commentary (注):** How does one’s proper form (形性) come to be lost? It is all because the ruler distorts it, leading to such calamities. Hence, they blame themselves **[1]**.

**[Codicil (疏):** People are born with different endowments (受气不同), and their natural capacities (禀分) vary. If each is assigned tasks according to their abilities, all will find their proper place. But if one thing is mismanaged, and its form or nature is impaired, the ruler should take responsibility, retreat, and blame himself. In ancient times, **Yīn Shāng** (殷汤) cut his own hair in penance, and rain fell for a thousand *lǐ*—this is an example.]

**[Codicil (疏) for [4]:** The steps of governance differ with each age, and the clarity of virtue (浇淳) varies with the times. Thus, today’s rulers do not manage affairs as they once did.]

**[5] Commentary (注):** To **hide** (匿) is to invert its nature; to **reveal** (显) is to use its nature. Hence, when one is exposed by external forces, they will all recognize it.

**[Codicil (疏):** The laws and decrees they enact all invert the natural order (物性), concealing faults while making the people ignorant and unable to discern. Thus, the multitude of crimes arises. The **释文** for **"匿"** (女力反) reads *"nǔlì,"* and **"为物而愚"** (一本作遇) was originally written as *"yù"* (遇).

◎ **俞樾** notes: Below, it says *"great for difficulties while daring not to punish"* (大为难而罪不敢), *"heavy burdens yet unable to bear the consequences"* (重为任而罚不胜), and *"distant paths yet failing to reach them"* (远其涂而诛不至). Here, **"罪"**, **"罚"**, and **"诛"** all refer to **inflicting punishment** (加之以刑). But this passage uses **"愚"** (愚), which does not align with the rest. The **释文** states: **"愚"** (愚) was originally written as **"遇"** (遇). **"遇"** likely stems from a misreading of **"过"** (过). The **Guǎng Yǎ** (广雅) explains **"过"** as **"blame"** (责). They blame the people for their ignorance—this is called **"过不识"** (overblaming ignorance). The **Lǚ Lǜn** (吕览) *Shì Wēi Piān* (适威篇) states: *"To impose burdens as instruction while overblaming ignorance, to issue frequent commands while disapproving of non-compliance, to create grave dangers while daring not to punish—these are the ways of the ruler."* This aligns with the passage’s meaning, but it correctly reads **"过不识"** (overblaming ignorance). **Gāo Yù** (高诱) interprets **"过"** as **"blame"** (责), which supports correcting this text’s error. **"过"** was mistakenly written as **"遇"**, then further altered to **"愚"**.

◎ **Qìng Fān** (庆藩) notes that **"愚"** (愚) and **"遇"** (遇) were interchangeable in ancient times. In the **Yàn Zǐ Chūn Qiū** (晏子春秋), *"Yàn Zǐ"* (晏子) used **"遇"** (遇) in *"to debauch and deceive the people"* (淫愚民), while **Mò Zǐ** (墨子) used **"遇"** (遇) in *"to deceive"* (愚). In the **Hán Zǐ** (韩子) *Nán Miàn Piān* (南面篇), **"遇"** (遇) refers to *"the lazy and indolent people"* (赣寙惰之民), and in the **Sòng Gān Dào Běn** (宋干道本), **"遇"** (遇) was used instead of **"愚"**. In the **Qín Cè** (秦策), *"deceived and confused"* (愚惑) is equated with *"the hearts of criminals"* (与罪人同心), and in the **Mào Běn** (姚本), **"遇"** (遇) was used instead of **"愚"**. Previously, it was thought that following the **释文**’s reading of **"遇"** (遇) was more plausible, but now **俞 Shì** (俞氏) argues that **"过"** (过) was the original character, making his explanation more refined. The characters **"过"** and **"遇"** were often confused in ancient texts due to their similar forms. In this book’s *Yú Fǔ Piān* (渔父篇), *"Today, I have been blamed"* (丘得过也) is recorded, with the **释文** noting that **"过"** (过) could also be written as **"遇"** (遇). In the *Ràng Wáng Piān* (让王篇), *"the ruler’s fault"* (君过) was written as **"遇"** (遇) in the original text. This confirms the mutual misreading of these two characters. **"不识"** (不识) means to **ignore** the natural order while forcing the people to recognize it.**

**[6] Commentary (注):** When one is easily swayed by external forces, they will all dare to act.

**[Codicil (疏):** Since laws are difficult to establish and enforcement is not straightforward, those who firmly violate them are punished. The **释文** for **"大为难而罪不敢"** (王云) reads: *"All that the ruler imposes must conform to what the people can bear; otherwise, they will find it difficult and dare not obey. But if he makes great demands that exceed their capacity, and they cannot fulfill them, then he punishes them for their disobedience."* **"所易"** (以豉反) is read as *"suǒyì"* (所易).**

**[7] Commentary (注):** When one lightens their burdens, they will all be able to bear them.

**[释文 for "不胜" (音升):** The pronunciation is *"shēng"* (升). The commentary remains the same.]**

**[8] Commentary (注):** When one aligns demands with the people’s strength and capacity, they will all reach their goals.**

---

**[Commentary (疏)]** When one’s strength is weak yet the tasks are heavy, demanding what cannot be borne, or when the journey is long yet the deadline is tight, punishing those who arrive late—these are all unjust.

**[9] Commentary (注):** [The people act thus] to avoid execution and punishment.

**[Commentary (疏)]** When wisdom and strength are exhausted, one cannot escape punishment, and fearing punishment, they resort to deceit.

**[释文 for "民知" (音智):** Pronounced *"zhì"* (智). The same below.]

**[10] Commentary (注):** If the ruler daily fosters deceit, how can the common people ever attain truth?

**[Commentary (疏)]** The winds of deceit arise daily, and falsehoods proliferate like weeds—where then can truth be found?

**[11] Commentary (注):** Blame should lie with the ruler.

**[Commentary (疏)]** When one’s knowledge and strength are exhausted, deceit must arise; when taxes and levies grow more urgent, greed and theft inevitably follow—all stemming from the ruler’s lack of **virtue**, whose laws and decrees only multiply. If the ruler could forget personal affection, abandon private gain, and disregard treasures, then blame should rest with the sovereign—why punish the common people?

Schu (蘧) Boyu (伯玉), surnamed **Schu** (蘧), named **Yuan** (瑗), styled **Boyu** (伯玉), was a virtuous and eminent minister of **Wei** (卫). His **virtue** was profound and luminous, penetrating the void of principle, so he could renew with the sun and transform with each year.

**[释文 for "蘧" (其居反):** Pronounced *"qú"* (居).]

**[1] Commentary (注):** He could adapt to the world without clinging to rigid distinctions of self and other.

**[Commentary (疏)]** At sixty years of age, he had undergone sixty transformations. Never did he begin by affirming something only to later reject it as false, nor did he know the so-called *"is"* and *"non-is"* of fifty-nine years prior.

**[2] Commentary (注):** He followed the natural flow of things, and their transformations unfolded thus.

**[释文 for "诎" (起勿反):** Pronounced *"qū"* (勿). *Guangya* (广雅) defines it as *"curved."* Guo (郭) pronounces it *"chù"* (黜).]

**[Commentary (疏)]** In the first year of his office, he affirmed something as *"is,"* but by year’s end, he rejected it as *"non-is."* Within a single year, *"is"* became *"non-is,"* so what was initially affirmed was later deemed false.

**[3] Commentary (注):** The transformations of things have no fixed end.

**[Commentary (疏)]** Thus, when change brings renewal, the new is *"is,"* and when the old fades, it becomes *"non-is."* Therefore, last year’s *"non-is"* becomes this year’s *"is,"* and this year’s *"is"* will be next year’s *"non-is."* To cling to *"is"* or *"non-is,"* to fixate on the new while rejecting the old—this is the flow of inversion. Hence, the **Container-Cheng** (容成) School said, *"Without days, there are no years,"* and **Schu Yuan** (蘧瑗) understood this, thus transforming with things.

**[4] Commentary (注):** Things have no roots or origins, no doors or openings—suddenly arising naturally, so none can perceive their source or trace their emergence. Only those who transcend birth and death can glimpse their origins and measure their roots.

**[Commentary (疏)]** Things arise with change, yet their birth has no root; they emerge through transformation, yet their appearance has no gateway. If there are no roots or doors, then there is no birth or emergence. If birth and emergence lack form, how can years be compared to them?

**[5] Commentary (注):** What I do not know, others may know. Thus, relying on the knowledge of things, one knows all; but relying solely on one’s own knowledge, one knows very little. Now, if one does not depend on things to know and instead exalts one’s own [limited] knowledge, then things will not inform you—how can this not be called great doubt?

**[Commentary (疏)]** What one knows is conventional knowledge; what one does not know is true knowledge. Common people revere discriminative knowledge, sharpening their emotions to accept or reject, yet they fail to rely on their [discriminative] *ignorance* to illuminate true principle—truly, they are people of great confusion.

**[6] Commentary (注):** Unable to utilize others, one has nowhere to take refuge.

**[Commentary (疏)]** *"Yǐ"* (已) means *"to stop."* Those who sharpen their emotions to accept or reject, failing to *[know]* rest, will inevitably encounter calamity and have no place to escape.

**[7] Commentary (注):** Those who claim *"this is so"* may not be affirmed by the world.

**[Commentary (疏)]** Each affirms what they affirm, each approves what they approve—self and other stand opposed, yet who is right and who is wrong?

**[释文 for "然与" (音余):** Pronounced *"rán yú"* (余), or as written. *"然乎"* (然乎) means *"is this truly so?"*

**[Collation (校)]**

Confucius inquired of the Grand Historian **Dàshǐ Dàzhuó**, as well as **Bó Chángqiān** and **Xī Wéi** [1], saying:

*"The Duke Ling of Wei indulges in drinking and revelry, yet does not attend to the governance of his state; he hunts with great nets and snares, yet does not respond to the affairs among the feudal lords. How is it that he is called ‘Ling’ [2]?"*

[1]
**[Commentary (疏)]** *Tàishǐ* is an official title. The three names below are those of the historians. The matters he inquires about are listed in the following text.
**[Phonetic Gloss (释文)]** *Dàshǐ* is pronounced *tài*. *Dàzhuó* is pronounced with the sound of "吐刀" (túdiāo, reversed), a personal name. *Bó Chángqiān* is pronounced with the sound of "起虔" (qǐqián, reversed), a personal name. *Xī* is also written as *qí* (同), pronounced *xū* (虚岂) or *xī* (希); Guo pronounces it *jì* (郗), Li pronounces it *xī* (熙). *Wéi* is pronounced as follows: Li says that *Xī Wéi* is the name of the Grand Historian.

[2]
**[Commentary (疏)]** *Bì* refers to a large net; *yì* means to shoot with a bowstring and arrow. A degenerate ruler, lost in licentious music and fond of drink, pursues hunting of birds and beasts, neglects state affairs, and does not attend to alliances and diplomatic exchanges among the feudal lords. You historians must determine his posthumous title—he lacks the Way to such an extent, why is he titled ‘Ling’?
**[Phonetic Gloss (释文)]** *Zhàn* (湛) is pronounced *dīnán* (丁南), meaning prolonged enjoyment. Li pronounces *yín* (淫) as *chángyín* (常淫). *Lè* (乐) is pronounced *luò* (洛). *Bù yìng* (不应) means failing to respond appropriately. *Zhūhóu zhī jiè* (诸侯之际) refers to matters of alliances and diplomacy; Sima says: *"affairs of covenants and assemblies."*

**Dàzhuó** replied: *"This is indeed the reason for it."* [1]

「**[1] [Annotation]** *Líng* is indeed the posthumous title for one who lacks the Way.

**[Commentary]** According to the *Zhōu Gōng* system of posthumous titles: *"To act in chaos without harm is called *líng*."* Thus, *líng* is the title for one who lacks the Way. Here, it is because of his lack of the Way that he is titled *Líng*, hence the saying: *"This is indeed the reason for it."*

Bó Chángqiān remarked: *"The Duke Líng had three wives who bathed together in the same tub. The historian Shǐ, as a minister of virtue, was summoned to attend them, and though offered silk and escorted with deference, he was not allowed to complete the ritual. Such was his arrogance—yet when he saw a virtuous man, he treated him with such reverence! This is why he was called Duke Líng."*

**[1] [Annotation]** Men and women bathing together—this is a violation of propriety.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Tóng lán* (同滥) is pronounced *xú hū zàn* (徐胡暂) or *lì zàn* (力暂), meaning a bathing vessel.

**[2] [Annotation]** Though he honored him as a virtuous man, the labor of attending to him was burdensome, so he seized the silk offerings and escorted him with exaggerated deference, preventing him from completing the ritual. This was how he showed reverence for the virtuous.

*Bì* (币) refers to the silk given to attendants.

**[Commentary]** *Lán* is a bathing vessel. Shǐ (史), with the courtesy name Yú, was a virtuous high minister of Wèi. *Bì* (币) means silk.

Additionally, the system of posthumous titles states: *"The clarity of virtue is called *líng*."* When men and women bathed together and a virtuous minister was summoned to attend, the Duke Líng, upon seeing Shǐ Yú—his loyal minister—felt deep shame and awe. He sent attendants to seize the silk offerings and escort him with exaggerated deference, ensuring he was sent away before completing the ritual. To treat the virtuous with such respect is the mark of an enlightened ruler, hence the title *Líng*—a title of virtue, not degeneracy.

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Shǐ* (史) is pronounced *qiū* (秋). Sīmǎ [Zhū] says: *"This refers to Shǐ Yú."*»

「The *So Bó* [is pronounced] *Bó* [博].

The *Bì* [弊]—Guō [郭] renders it as *Bì* [币], meaning silk—was reversed by Xú Fúshì [徐扶世]. Sīmǎ [司马] pronounces it *Bì* [蔽], saying: *"He drew his garments to cover himself."* ◎Lú Wénbiàn [卢文弨] remarks: *"The text now reads *Bì* [币]."*

*"While exulting in virtue"*—Sīmǎ [司马] explains: *"It refers to the Duke Líng and the bathing women supporting each other in mutual concealment."* This interpretation differs markedly from Guō’s [郭].

**[Commentary]** *Líng* [灵] has two meanings: *(1) it signifies* **enlightenment** *(and)* *(2)* **virtue**—it can also be deemed good**, hence Zhòngní [仲尼] inquired about it.

**[Citation]** *"When men and women bathed together, the Duke’s arrogance and negligence reached their peak. Suddenly seeing a virtuous man, he was instantly filled with reverence and solemnity, thus deserving the title of *Líng*—an enlightened ruler."*

**[Correction]** *(1) The* *Zhāng Jūnfáng* [张君房] *copy mistakenly renders* *Lán* [滥] *as* *Jiàn* [槛].
*(2) The character* *Yì* [亦] *is corrected according to* *Fù Sòng* [覆宋] *copy and* *Wáng Shùjìn* [王叔岷] *’s explanation.*

*Wéi* [狶] *yǔ* *Chángqiān* [常骞], *Wéi* [卫] *Zhuānggōng* [庄公], whose name was *Kuō Luò* [蒯瞶], said: *"When Línggōng [灵公] died, we divined his burial at his ancestral tomb—it was unlucky. We divined his burial at Shāqiū [沙丘]—it was lucky. Digging several *rèn* [仞] deep, we uncovered a stone coffin, which we washed and examined. An inscription was found upon it, reading: *'Not relying upon his son, Línggōng seized this place to bury himself.'* Línggōng’s virtue was long established—what need had he of these two men to recognize it!"*

**[Explanation]** *Zǐ* [子] refers to *Kuō Luò* [蒯瞶]. It means Línggōng was not depending on his son to secure this burial site. All things have their predetermined fate, so events can be foreseen. Thus, whatever one does, one **must** do; whatever one does not do, one **cannot** do. Yet fools believe it lies within their own power—is this not delusion!

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Ancestral tomb"*—one copy reads *"great tomb"* [大墓].
*Shāqiū* [沙丘] is a place name.
*"Digging"*—its pronunciation is *qū* [掘之] with *yù* [月] tone, or *wù* [勿] tone.
*"Several"*—its pronunciation is *shù* [数仞] with *zhǔ* [主] tone.
*"Washing"*—its pronunciation is *xǐ* [洗而] with *lǐ* [礼] tone.
*"Not relying"*—pronounced *bù píng* [不凭].
*"His son"*—Guō [郭] reads it as an abrupt sentence. Sīmǎ [司马], taking *zǐ* [子] as an abrupt sentence, says: *"It means his descendants were insufficient to depend upon, so he took this place as his tomb."* ◎Jiāshì Fù [家世父] remarks: *"Guō Xiàng’s [郭象] annotation, that* *zǐ* [子] *refers to* *Kuō Luò* [蒯瞶], *is incorrect. The stone coffin had an inscription, indicating that the ancient burial practice was to say that descendants would be unable to uphold and preserve the tomb, and Línggōng seized it for himself."* The *Shìwén* [释文] also reads *"seized to bury himself"* [夺而埋之], which aligns with this.

*"Seized and buried"*—*ér* [而] means *"you"* (addressing the son). *Lǐ* [里] means *"residence"* or *"burial place."* One copy reads *"seized to bury himself"* [夺而埋之].
*Kuō* [蒯] is pronounced *qǐ* [起] with *guài* [怪] tone.
*Luò* [瞶] is pronounced *wǔ* [五] with *guài* [怪] tone—*Kuō Luò* [蒯瞶] was the name of *Wèi Zhuānggōng* [卫庄公].
*"His burial place"*—pronounced *rǔ* [汝] with *chàng* [昌] tone below.

**[Commentary]** *Shāqiū* [沙丘] is a place name, located north of the *Méngjīn* [盟津] River. *Zǐ* [子] refers to *Kuō Luò* [蒯瞶]. To clarify that all posthumous titles and names are determined before their signs manifest, and not contingent on external circumstances, the stone coffin at *Shāqiū* [沙丘] had its inscription beforehand. Could Línggōng have relied on *Kuō Luò* [蒯瞶] to seize the burial site? *Shǐ* [史] and *Chángqiān* [常骞]—how could they possibly recognize such matters!

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"To recognize"*—pronounced *shí* [识] with *xiàn* [贤] tone.

**[Correction]** *(1) Zhào Jiànyì* [赵谏议] *copy reads* *"seized to bury"* [埋].
*Shǎozhī* [少知] *questioned* *Dà* [大] *Gōng Tiáo* [公调], saying: *"What is meant by* **‘homely burial’** [丘里之言]?"*

**[Explanation]** *Shǎozhī* [少知] was a man of limited wisdom. *Tài* [太] means *great*, and *gōng* [公] means *proper* or *correct*.

The **Dao/Way** is vast and boundless, its **virtue/power** untainted by partiality, yet it harmonizes all things without strain. Hence, it is called **Tài Gōng Tiáo** [太公调].

If two persons were to debate its principles:

**[Phonetic Gloss]** *"Tài Gōng"*—pronounced *tài* [泰].

**[Correction]** *(1) Zhào Jiànyì* [赵谏议] *copy reads* *"Tài"* [太]. Followed below.

**Tài Gōng Tiáo** [太公调] would say: *"‘Homely burial’ refers to the blending of ten lineages and a hundred names to establish custom—uniting differences to create uniformity, yet dispersing uniformity to reveal new distinctions. Just as we point to the hundred parts of a horse yet cannot grasp the horse itself, yet when the horse is tethered before us, we name its hundred forms and call it ‘horse.’ Thus, hills and mountains amass lowly earth and stone to become lofty; rivers and seas converge countless streams to become vast. Great persons unite all to achieve **virtue/power** without partiality.

Therefore, those who teach from without have authority yet do not constrain; those who act from within have correctness yet do not oppose. The four seasons vary in their *qi*, yet since Heaven does not bestow them, the years are fulfilled; the five officials differ in their duties, yet since the ruler does not favor them, the realm is governed. When the **virtue/power** of the sage does not bestow, then **virtue/power** is complete; when all things differ in their *dharma* yet the Dao/Way does not favor, then there is no name. Without name, there is no action; without action, there is no lack of action. Time has its end and beginning, the world its transformations. Misfortune and fortune flow pure and unceasing, yet what seems contrary may also be fitting; self-sacrifice takes varied forms, yet what is corrected may also be misaligned.

Compare it to the great marsh: all materials cross it without hindrance; observe it in the great mountain: wood and stone alike ascend its heights. This is what is meant by **‘homely burial’** [丘里之言]."*

**[Explanation]** *(1) "Blending"*—it takes the ten lineages (each lineage ten persons) and a hundred names (each lineage ten persons), combining them to establish custom. *(2) "Homely burial"*—like the ancient practice of gathering the customs of villages and neighborhoods (ten families as a *qiū* [丘], twenty as a *lǐ* [里]), where local traditions varied, yet through debate, distinctions were clarified. *(3) "Great persons unite all"*—without partiality toward the world, the world’s customs align. *(4) "Reside in authority yet do not constrain"*—the sage’s teachings enter from without yet adapt to circumstances, so authority is held without rigid enforcement. *(5) "Act from within yet do not oppose"*—from within, the nature of all things emerges, each finding its proper place, so there is no resistance. *(6) "Years are fulfilled"*—*suìchéng* [岁成], lit. "yearly completion," meaning the seasons proceed naturally. *(7) "Realm is governed"*—*guózhì* [国治], lit. "state governed," with *zhì* [治] pronounced *lì* [吏]. *(8) "When the **virtue/power** of the sage does not bestow"*—the sage’s **virtue/power** is inherent, not granted; if it were bestowed, it would sometimes fail. *(9) "What is corrected may also be misaligned"*—though some acts align with the Dao/Way, others may diverge. *(10) "All materials cross it"*—*bǎi cái jiē dù* [百材皆度], meaning all things traverse the marsh without obstruction. *(11) "Ascend its heights"*—*mùshí tóng tán* [木石同坛], wood and stone alike reach the same heights.

**(10) [注]** Names halt at reality, hence **non-action**; reality each fulfills itself, hence **nothing is left undone**.
**[疏]** Merit belongs to things themselves, thus it is **non-action**; yet without clinging to this **non-action**, there is **nothing left undone**.

**(11) [注]** Hence, the **heartless** aligns naturally.
**[疏]** *Times* refers to the four seasons in orderly succession. *World* refers to human affairs, ever-shifting and unstable.

**(12) [注]** Flowing and returning in cycles.
**[疏]** *Chúnchún* [淳淳]—the image of flowing motion. Heaven’s seasons of cold and heat ebb and flow without constancy; human fortunes of calamity and blessing—how could they endure long? Hence the ancient text says: *"Calamity, oh calamity! It leans upon fortune; fortune, oh fortune! It harbors calamity within."*

**(13) [注]** What is perverse here may be fitting there.
**[疏]** *Fú* [拂]—*lì* [戾], meaning contrary. Things’ inclinations and aversions have no fixed standard; thus what is perverse here may be fitting there. Hence, those who grasp the Dao/Way do not rigidly adhere to what is逆 or顺.

**(14) [注]** Each follows what it deems true, unable to depart from it.
**[疏]** *Shùn* [殉]—to pursue. *Miàn* [面]—to face. Truth and falsehood clash in stubborn adherence; each pursues its own view, their directions diverging.

**(15) [注]** What is correct here may err there.
**[疏]** What is fixed as correct here may be flawed there—this illustrates how things’ natures invert, differing in their inclinations.

**(16) [注]** No talent is discarded.
**[疏]** *Bǐ* [比]—to liken. *Dù* [度]—to measure. Vast marshes and wetlands teem with life; by measuring each talent’s capacity, none are cast aside. The sage’s way of taking things follows this principle too.

**(17) [注]** Uniting differences to form unity.
**[疏]** *Tán* [坛]—foundation. Stones vary in size, wood in thickness; yet gathered upon the great mountain as a base, differences merge into unity.

**(18) [注]** Speak of villages and hamlets, and the world may be understood.
**[疏]** A summation of prior meanings.

---
**Minor’s Question:** *"Then calling it the Dao/Way—is that sufficient?"*
**[疏]** To name the Dao/Way by its principle—is this naming sufficient? The question arises to clarify that the supreme Dao/Way transcends naming.

**Great Public’s Response:** *"No. Counting all things, they do not stop at ten thousand, yet we say ‘ten thousand things’—we name the most numerous among them. Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yin and yang, the greatest of qi; the Dao/Way is their universal principle. To name it by its grandeur is acceptable, yet having already named it, how could we compare it further? Such reasoning falls far short—like comparing dogs and horses."*

**(1) [注]** Things with numbers do not even stop at ten thousand; how much less the boundless Dao/Way—could it be measured?
**[疏]** *Qī* [期]—limit. *Hào* [号]—speak of. Formed things are infinite; yet people limit them as ‘ten thousand things,’ speaking of the greatest general case. Likewise, the Dao/Way’s subtle principle is nameless in origin, yet by its function, it is forcibly named *Dao*—yet this naming is insufficient to grasp its essence.

**(2) [注]** Things attain harmony through it; it harmonizes all without partiality, yet we forcibly label it *Dao*.
**[疏]** Heaven covers, Earth bears; yin and yang nurture life—these are the greatest among forms and qi. The Dao/Way harmonizes all things, nurtures life without bias, hence it is called *public* [公].

**(3) [注]** This is the *Dao/Way that can be spoken of*.
**[疏]** The great harmony gives rise to all things, generating life in myriad forms. Speaking of its origin, it is truly nameless; yet by its function, we name it *Dao*—and this naming, though inadequate, is acceptable.

**(4) [注]** Having already named it, how could we further compare it to anything?
**[疏]** By its function, the name *Dao* already exists; we cannot compare this named principle to the nameless essence.

「By such comparisons, we stray far from the mark. **[5] [注]** Since there is no debate over its name, it falls short of the distant truth; thus, the *Dao* is said to remain insufficient. Only when it reaches the realm of the *nameless* and *unspeakable* can it attain its fullness—though named, nothing can be compared to it. **[疏]** Even when comparing only to beasts like dogs and horses, there is not only a difference in size but also in rank and worth. Now, to compare the *named Dao* to the *nameless principle*, there is not only a distinction between coarse and subtle, but also between deep and shallow—thus, it falls short of the distant truth.

**[校]** (1) The text is missing; Liu Deyi’s version reads *guang* (广) instead. Minor notes: *“Within the four directions, within the six concourses, from where do all things arise?”* **[1] [注]** Those who ask this may say the *Dao* generates them. **[疏]** Within the six concourses, between Heaven and Earth, how do all living things—both moving and growing—originate? Minor notes asks this to clarify their source. **[释文]** *恶起* (*wùqǐ*) is pronounced *wū* (乌).

The Great Public Harmony responds: *“Yin and yang illuminate, shelter, and regulate each other; the four seasons succeed, generate, and destroy one another **[1]**. Desire, aversion, approach, and avoidance arise from this; mating and union occur naturally **[2]**. Safety and danger transform; calamity and fortune arise; urgency and ease interact; gathering and dispersal take form **[3]**. This is what can be recorded as *name* and *reality*, what can be marked as *subtle* and *refined* **[4]**. Following their sequence, they act in harmony; their operations circulate, exhausting to return, ending to begin anew. This is what things possess **[5]**, what speech can exhaust, what knowledge can reach—the utmost of things **[6]**. Those who perceive the *Dao* do not follow what is discarded, nor trace what arises **[7]**—this is where discussion ceases **[8]**.” **[1] [注]** These are their natural operations, not without origin.**»**

The three luminaries illuminate one another **[1]**, the two *yīng-yáng* [2] alternate in dominance, winds and rains regulate each other, heat and cold succeed one another, spring and summer generate, autumn and winter destroy **[3]**. How could this involve human sentiment or deliberation? It is merely the natural *lǐ* [4] of things.

◎ Yu Yüeh remarked: *"This should be read as ‘harm’."* The *Er Yǎ* ["Explanations of Words"] states: *"‘Swathe’ means to sever."* The *Shìwén* ["Explanations of Texts"] says: *"‘Swathe’—the *Shèrén* [5] version reads ‘harm.’"* Thus, *swathe* and *harm* are anciently interchangeable characters. Sometimes *yīng-yáng* harm each other, sometimes they regulate each other—just as the four seasons succeed, generate, and destroy one another below **[6]**.

**[2]** All these occurrences are what is called *trends and choices* **[7]**, arising from the interplay of *yīng-yáng* and the succession of the four seasons.

**[Citation]** *"Ming"* [8] means to rise; *"yōng"* means constant. When aligned, one approaches and desires; when opposed, one repels and withdraws. It speaks of how things, within the *yīng-yáng* transformations, harbor these emotions and desires, opening and closing in union—this is their constant state.

**[Shìwén Glosses]** *"Desire"* is pronounced *wùlù* [9]. *"Ming"* [10] is pronounced *jūbiǎo* [11]. The same below. Also pronounced *gāo* [12].

「King [Wang Bi] said: *"Gāo"* [17] means lofty; *"jìng"* [18] means forceful, speaking of the swift and vigorous nature of what arises.

**[3]** **[Citation]** The man who encounters *Tài* [19] finds peace; the man who meets *Yōng* [20] faces peril. Peril brings calamity, peace brings blessing; gradualness extends life, haste cuts it short; dispersion leads to death, concentration to life. All these matters stem from the friction of *造化* [21] and are as boundless as the four seasons’ transformations—how could they be confined by human emotions and deliberations?

**[4]** **[Citation]** Beyond this, it reaches the realm of *naturalness*. The workings of naturalness—who can fathom their origins?

**[Citation]** *"Zhì"* [22] means to record. Within the realm of *yīng-yáng*, between heaven and earth, there exists something tangible and named, hence it can be classified and documented. Even if it be subtle and refined, it may still be articulated and recorded; but when it comes to the profound *重玄* [23] Dao, transcending all forms and names, it cannot be sought through words or symbols.

**[5]** **[Citation]** All these phenomena are inherent in things, arising naturally—it is not that there is no power to bring them about.

**[Citation]** The four seasons cycle in turn, regulating and governing one another; the five phases move in succession, driving and restraining each other. When things reach their limits, they turn back; when they conclude, they begin anew. The principles of all things are exhausted here.

**[Shìwén Glosses]** *"Suí xù"* [24] is pronounced *"suìbiǎn"* [25], meaning "to follow and transform in sequence." *Xù* may also be written as *"yuán"* [26] or *"xiǎng"* [27]. *"Qī yùn"* [28] refers to the phases’ sequential transformations, where one phase follows and replaces another in due order, and each phase governs and restrains the next.

**[6]** **[Citation]** Since phenomena have no further limits beyond themselves, it is said that knowledge cannot surpass the study of things.

**[Citation]** The profound Dao is beyond words and comprehension. If one attempts to define it through speech, debate, or thought, one can only reach the limits of tangible things—never attaining the realm of *玄玄* [29].

**[Shìwén Glosses]** *"Suǒ fù"* [30] is pronounced *"fú yòu"* [31].

**[7]** **[Citation]** Both "making" and "not making" arise from this; there is no external cause to follow.

**[8]** **[Citation]** Since all this arises inherently, there is nothing left to debate.

**[Citation]** *"Dǔ"* [32] means to see; *"suí"* [33] means to follow. Those who perceive the Dao, who grasp its profound mystery, focus their essence beyond phenomena, and in stillness, illuminate the cycle. They realize all things are ultimately Dao; the four phases are not fixed. How could they cling to emotions and things, dissecting the origins of "making" and "not making"?

This is what is meant by *"the Dao that cannot be spoken, the arguments that cease."* Shào Zhī asked: *"Does Ji Zhēn’s ‘not making’ or Jiē Zǐ’s ‘sometimes making’ align with true principles? Which view is correct in its essence, which comprehensive in its reasoning?"*

**[1]** **[Citation]** Ji Zhēn said, "The Dao does not act." Jiē Zǐ said, "The Dao sometimes acts." ‘Sometimes acts’ means the Dao has the power to make things arise.

**[Citation]** Ji Zhēn and Jiē Zǐ were both sages of the state of Qí, both studying at the *Jìxià* [34] school. Thus, Shào Zhī invoked the two sages to clarify the Dao. *"Mò"* [35] means ‘nonexistence’; *"huò"* [36] means ‘existence.’ Ji Zhēn held that the Dao is ‘nonexistence,’ while Jiē Zǐ argued that the Dao has the power to make things arise. Each upheld one perspective, yet neither provided a complete explanation. Now Shào Zhī questions this to determine the right and wrong, the correct and the erroneous, in their understanding of the Dao’s true nature and profound principles.

**[Shìwén Glosses]** *"Shì biàn"* [37] is pronounced *"biàn"* [38] or *"biān"* [39] (according to Xú). Dàgōng Diào said: *"The crowing of roosters, the barking of dogs—these are what people know. Even the most enlightened cannot articulate the Dao’s self-so transformation, nor can they grasp what it will bring about. To analyze it thus, the subtleties become boundless, the greatness unfathomable. ‘Sometimes acts’ and ‘does not act’—these are mere speculations, not ultimate truths. The Dao’s essence is boundless and endless; speech cannot capture it, and thought only distances us. What has not yet arisen cannot be avoided; what is already dead cannot be returned. Death and life are not far apart, yet their principles cannot be seen. ‘Sometimes acts’ and ‘does not act’—these are conjectures based on illusion. Observing the Dao’s origin, it extends infinitely; seeking its end, it knows no halt. Infinite and endless, speech cannot grasp it—it aligns with the Dao of things. ‘Sometimes acts’ and ‘does not act’—this is speech about its origin, corresponding with the Dao’s beginning and end. The Dao cannot be possessed, yet to lack possession is impossible. The Dao’s name is a borrowed vessel for its operation."*

「Or it acts, or it does not act—this is but one twist of things, yet how could it suffice for the Great Way?  【一七】
If words alone suffice, then speaking all day would exhaust the Dao;  【一八】
if words alone do not suffice, then speaking all day would exhaust things.  【一九】
At the utmost of Dao and things, words and silence are insufficient to convey it;
neither words nor silence can fully express the principle of its own nature.  【二０】
Non-speech, non-silence—this is where discourse reaches its limit.  【二一」

---
**Annotations (for context, not commentary):**
【一】*[Note]* Things have their own natural course; it is not something that can be willed by action.
Thus, from this perspective, Ji Zhen’s words are correct.

**Exegesis:** The sight of the eyes and the hearing of the ears—chicken crows, dogs bark—these arise from the spontaneous workings of Nature. Both the wise and the foolish recognize them alike.
Thus, even the greatest sage, with all his knowledge, cannot fathom what causes them to crow or bark, nor can he articulate their underlying principles. Their barking and crowing are natural; how could the Dao compel them to do so?
Hence, the view of the *Jiezi* is flawed in reasoning.

**Textual Clarification:** *Brǎi* (吠) is pronounced *fèi* (符废反). *Dàzhī* (大知) is read as *dàzhì* (大智).

---
【二】*[Note]* All things act without being willed, yet they do so of their own accord.

**Exegesis:** Even if we take the subtlest things, which lack discernible order, or the coarsest things, which cannot be measured—applying this reasoning to analyze them, not a single thing exists that does not act naturally on its own.

---
【三】*[Note]* Things have their own natural inclinations, yet all arise without being willed. Thus, "it does not act" is not to say that things do not act.
All things, in this way, are transformed through non-action.

**Exegesis:** If one does not align with the Dao, then one cannot escape the realm of things;
if one clings to one side, then one ultimately falls into error.

---
【四】*[Note]* It is truly self-willed.

**Exegesis:** Clinging to existence is itself the error.

---
【五】*[Note]* There is no willed origin.

**Exegesis:** To drown in non-existence is also an error.

---
【六】*[Note]* Indicating the nature of names and reality.

---
【七】*[Note]* The nature of things is ultimately the utmost emptiness.

**Exegesis:** If one’s mind clings to existence, then everything is seen as things;
if one’s mind clings to non-existence, then everything is seen as emptiness.
Thus, existence and non-existence reside in the mind, not in external reality.

---
【八】*[Note]* Therefore, one must seek it beyond words and thought.

**Exegesis:** That which can be articulated in words or grasped by thought is ever more distant from the Dao.
Thus, one must seek it beyond words and thought.

---
【九】*[Note]* Life suddenly arises; it cannot be controlled by one’s own will, and one cannot prevent it.

【一０】*[Note]* Death suddenly occurs; one cannot defy it.

**Exegesis:** To *prohibit* (忌) is to *restrain* (禁); to *obstruct* (阻) is to *hinder* (碍).
Life suddenly arises—it cannot be restrained or prohibited;
death suddenly occurs—what hindrance or obstruction could there be?
Only by following change and yielding to transformation can one find peace in all circumstances.
Some texts render *阻* as *zhù* (沮), meaning *to lament*.
Death comes in accordance with Nature, so there is no lamentation over loss.

**Textual Clarification:** *Bùkě zǐ* (不可徂) is also written as *bùkě zǔ* (不可阻).」

---

**【校】**
(1) Zhao Jianyi originally translated *徂* (zǐ) as *阻* (zǔ).
(2) The *Shì Dé Táng* edition has "its having" (其有所作) where the original text has "its being" (其有).
(3) Zhao’s edition omits the character *有所* (having).
(4) The character *之* (zhi) is deleted according to the *Shì Dé Táng* edition.

**Volume 9, Upper Section**
*Miscellaneous Chapters on External Things* (外物第二十六)
*Miscellaneous Chapters on Parables* (寓言第二十七)

---

**《外物》第二十六【一】**

**【一】**
**【Text】** The chapter is named by its subject.
External things are not to be trusted **[1]**,**
so Long Feng was executed, Bi Gan was slaughtered, Ji Zi was driven mad, and E Lai died **[2]**.
The sovereign cannot but desire his ministers’ **loyalty**,
yet **loyalty** is not necessarily rewarded **[3]**,**
so Wu Yuan was exiled to the Jiang River,
and Zang Hong died in Shu **[4]**,**
their blood concealed for three years and then transformed into jade **[5]**.

Parents cannot but desire their children’s **filial piety**,
yet **filial piety** is not necessarily loved **[6]**,**
so Xiao Ji died of grief,
and Zeng Shen wept in sorrow **[7]**.

Wood against wood produces friction and heat **[8]**, metal against fire produces melting **[9]**.
When **yin** and **yang** clash in their courses,
the heavens and earth are in great turmoil **[10]**,**
and thus there is thunder and lightning,
fire in the water, and the great huái tree is consumed **[11]**.

There is a sorrow so profound that one is trapped in two disasters and cannot escape **[12]**.
The cicada and the ant cannot reach completion **[13]**.
The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth **[14]**,**
buried in grief and stagnation **[15]**,**
as **benefit** and **harm** rub against each other,
generating much fire **[16]**.
The common people set the harmonies ablaze **[17]**.
The moon, though constant, cannot withstand fire **[18]**.
Thus, there is a moment of **lamentation** (僓) and the **Dao** is exhausted **[19]**.

**【一】【疏】**
[The heart] is fixed in rigid resolve—this is what is meant by "trust."
Yet between human affairs and things,
there are myriad shifts and threads **[20]**.
Only by aligning with the great **order** (大顺) of Nature
does one attain **emptiness** and **permeation** (虚通) everywhere.
If one opposes things and clings to emotions,
disaster and harm are certain to follow.

**【释文】** In *External Things* (《外物》), Wang Yun says:
*"He who forgets his own self
is naturally without concern for the world,
and thus external things have no need to be trusted.
But if one clings to some fixed view,
then even the **Dao** will never be perfectly attained."*

◎ Lu Wénbián says:
*"The Song edition reads 'trust' (必) instead of 'heart' (心)."*
◎ Qing Fan annotates:
*"The *Wén Xuǎn* commentary on Ji Chūyè’s *Discourse on Nurturing Life* (养生论) quotes Sima [Qian] as saying:
'External things' (物) refers to 'affairs.'
**Loyalty** and **filial piety** are internal [virtues],
yet external affairs are never fully trusted or received."*

*(Translation of 释文 omitted.)*

**【二】【注】**
The consequences of **good** and **evil** are both uncertain.

**【疏】**
Long Feng and Bi Gan are already explained in the *External Things* chapter.
Ji Zi was a younger brother of the Shang tyrant Zhou,
**loyal** in his remonstrance but ignored,
fearing Zhou’s harm, so he feigned madness—
yet he still could not escape execution.
E Lai was Zhou’s flattering minister,
and when Zhou’s fate was sealed,
E Lai shared the same downfall.

**【三】【注】**
[This is the result of] **sincerity** and **devotion** (精诚) to the utmost.

**【疏】**
Jade (碧) is a precious stone.
Wu Yuan and Zang Hong are already explained in the *External Things* chapter.
Yet regarding Wu Yuan’s exile to the Jiang River:
He remonstrated with King Fu Cha of Yue,
but Fu Cha killed him.
Taking horsehide to make a sack,
shaped like an owl (鸱鸟),
he stored Wu Yuan’s body inside,
and floated it upon the Jiang River—
hence, 'exiled to the Jiang River.'
Zang Hong was slandered,
banished and returning to Shu,
where he lamented his **loyalty** leading to slander,
so he slit his abdomen and died.
The people of Shu were moved by his fate,
concealing his blood in a wooden box,
and after three years, it transformed into jade—
this is the **sincerity** and **devotion** to the utmost.

**【释文】**
In *Wu Yuan’s blood concealed for three years* (《藏其血三年》), Lü’s *Spring and Autumn Annals* (《吕氏春秋》) states:
*"His blood was concealed for three years,
and it transformed into jade."*

◎ Qing Fan annotates:
*"The *Taiping Yulan* (八百九) quotes Sima [Qian] as saying:
'Zang Hong was **loyal** yet exiled,
so his blood did not decay and transformed into jade.'"*

*(Translation of 释文 omitted.)*

**【四】【注】**
Thus, the **perfected ones** (至人) have no heart **[21]**,
yet they respond to things **[22]**,**
adapting only to what is fitting.

**【疏】**
Xiao Ji was the son of Shang Gaozong **[23]**.
He suffered from his stepmother’s calamity,
grieving to the point of death.
Yet Zeng Shen was **paragon of filial piety**,
yet his parents hated him,
often beating him to near-death—
hence, his sorrowful weeping.
The bond between father and son is the **order** of Nature,
the tie between ruler and minister is **virtue** of utmost weight,
yet even **loyalty** and **filial piety** of the highest degree
still face rejection and misunderstanding.
How much more so the myriad affairs of the world,
which can truly be trusted or relied upon?
Only by forgetting oneself and things,
adapting to what is fitting,
can one preserve one’s life and avoid harm.

「【Exegesis】 *Qióng* is pronounced *tuí* (as in "decay"), or *huái* (as in "embrace"). Guo Xiang says: "It means *to follow* [the natural way]."

【Collation Notes】
(1) The original text mistakenly reads *mì*, corrected according to the *Shìdé Táng* edition. The following exegesis remains consistent.
(2) The *Shìdé Táng* edition reads *zhī* (as in "know") instead of *zhì* (as in "purpose").

Zhuangzi, being impoverished, thus went to borrow grain from the *Jiānhé Hóu* [1].
The *Jiānhé Hóu* said: "Very well. When I receive the tribute from my fiefdom, I will lend you three hundred *jīn* [2]. Will that suffice?"

---
[1] **Exegesis:** *Jiānhé Hóu* refers to *Wéi Wén Hóu*. Zhuangzi, of noble lineage yet indifferent to worldly affairs, his family being destitute, thus came to borrow grain.
**Exegesis of Terms:** *Dài sù* (借粟) is pronounced *tè* (as in "special"), or alternatively *tā dé* (as in "he obtains"). *Jiānhé Hóu* is pronounced *gǔ xián* (as in "ancient official"). The *Shuōyuàn* records this as *Wéi Wén Hóu*.

[2] **Exegesis:** *Nuò* (诺) means "to agree." Copper, iron, and their kinds are all called *jīn* (金), not referring to gold here. He waits until year’s end to receive the taxes, tributes, and fiefs of his people before lending to Zhuangzi.
**Exegesis of Terms:** *Jiāng dài* (将贷) is pronounced *tā dài* (as in "he lends").

Zhuangzi, indignant, flushed with anger, said: "Yesterday, as I came, there was someone calling out from the middle of the road. I looked back and saw a carp in the wheel ruts. I asked it: ‘Carp! What are you doing here?’
It replied: ‘I am a subject of the waves of the Eastern Sea. Do you perhaps have a *dǒu-shēng* (斗升) of water to revive me?’ [1]

Zhuangzi said: ‘Very well. I will travel south to the kings of *Wú* and *Yuè*, divert the waters of the *Xī Jiāng* to welcome you. Will that suffice?’ [2]

The carp, indignant, flushed with anger, said: ‘I have lost my native element, and I have nowhere to be! A *dǒu-shēng* of water would suffice to revive me. Yet you speak thus—it would have been better to seek me early in the dried-fish market!’ [3]"

---
[1] **Exegesis:** A humble servant of the waves, trapped in the wheel ruts—does the lord perhaps have water to save me?
**Exegesis of Terms:** *Ér hū* (而呼) is pronounced *huǒ gù* (as in "fire’s fault"). *Fù* (鲋) is pronounced *fù* (as in "attach"). The *Guǎngyà* says: it is *fèn* (鰿). *Fèn* is pronounced *jì* (as in "track"). *Bō chén* (波臣): Sima Qian says: "It refers to a servant of the surging waves."

[2] **Exegesis:** *Xī Jiāng* is the *Shǔ Jiāng*. Though many rivers flow northward, only the *Shǔ Jiāng* comes from the west, hence called *Xī Jiāng*.
**Exegesis of Terms:** *Jī Xī* (激西) is pronounced *gǔ dí* (as in "ancient enemy").

[3] **Note:** This illustrates that even the most fitting thing, if misapplied, is useless—though grand, it profits nothing.
**Exegesis:** *Suǒ* (索) means "to seek." *Shì* (肆) means "market."

The carp that habitually swims the sea’s waves,
when lost in the surging tides of its usual course,
could be saved by a mere dipper’s worth of water—
yet to rouse the *Xī Jiāng*’s torrent is unseemly.

Since it cannot rescue even for a moment,
better to seek me in the dried-fish market.

This illustrates that in all matters, great or small,
there is a fitting time and opportunity.
If one fails to seize the moment,
even the grandest efforts yield no benefit.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Ér suǒ* (早索) is pronounced *suǒ bái* (as in "white of the egg").
*Gū yú* (枯鱼) – Li [Fan] says: it means "dried fish."

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The text omits a "say" character after *yóu* (游) in Zhang Junfang’s edition.

---
The Prince of Rèn, fashioning a colossal hook and thick black line,
using five great oxen as bait,
squatted upon Mount Kuàiji,
casting his rod into the Eastern Sea,
fishing daily—yet for a full year, no fish took the hook.

Then a great fish swallowed it, dragging the massive hook downward,
plunging and surging, its scales flashing like white mountains,
the sea roiling, its voice rivaling the gods—
its terror echoed a thousand *lǐ*.

---
When the Prince of Rèn caught this fish,
he cured and salted it, and from the River eastward,
to the northern reaches of Cāngwú,
none could resist its flavor.

Afterward, the clever orators and persuasive scholars
were all astonished and told one another of it.

---
To raise a rod and wait by shallow streams,
to guard a carp—
how difficult to catch a great fish!
To adorn trifling tales before a county magistrate—
how distant from true enlightenment!

Thus, one has never heard of the customs of the Rèn clan,
for their way is far removed from the world’s common path.

---
**Exegesis:**
Rèn – a state’s name; the son of the Rèn lord.
*Jù* (巨) – great.

Kuàiji – a mountain’s name, now a prefecture.

---
After a year, a great fish took the hook,
dragging it down, plunging with wild haste,
flashing its head and tail, its scales gleaming—
thus the white waves rose like mountains,
the vast waves met the sun.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Qī nián* (期年) – originally also written as *qī* (期), same pronunciation. *Jī* (基).

「【Cushu】 Named as *Dà gōu* (大钩), yet after a year, no fish was caught.
*Dūn* (蹲) – *jù* (踞), meaning "to sit."
They sat upon the mountain.

**Exegesis of Terms:**

---

When the hook was taken by a great fish,
it dragged the hook down, plunging with wild haste,
flashing its head and tail, its scales gleaming—
thus the white waves rose like mountains,
the vast waves met the sun.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Dà yú* (若鱼) – Sima Qian says: a great fish named *Ruò* (若), the sea god.
Others say: *Ruò yú* (若鱼), meaning "this fish."
*Là* (腊) – pronounced *xī* (昔).
*Zhì hé* (制河) – pronounced *shè hé* (设河), should be written as *Zhè hé* (浙河), meaning "to the east of the Zhe River."
The *Han Shu Yìyì* (汉书音义) pronounces it *shì hé* (逝河).
In the north, all waters are called "river" (河), while the Zhe River (浙江) is now in *Yúhàng* (余杭) Commandery,
used by the Later Han as the boundary dividing *Wèihuì* (吴会).
Sima Qian says: the Zhe River (浙江), now in *Kuàijì* (会稽) and *Qiantáng* (钱塘).
◎ *Qìng Fān* (庆藩) notes: The meaning of *zhì* (制) in "to the east of the Zhe River" aligns with the pronunciation *shè* (设),
and the character should be *Zhè* (浙).
Ancient *zhì* (制) shares the same pronunciation as *Zhè* (浙).
In the *Lunyu Yán Yuán* (论语颜渊篇), the *Zheng* (郑) commentary says: "Ru reads *zhé* (折) as *zhì* (制)."
In the *Shu Lü Xíng* (书吕刑), *Mòzǐ Shàng Tóng* (墨子尚同篇), "to make" (制作) is pronounced *zhé* (折).

---

In the final days of the season’s end,
the people were light and frivolous,
reciting verses and words,
yet neglecting the profound Dao/Way.
When they heard of the great fish,
they were startled and spoke of it among themselves.
The character *qiāng* (轻) is sometimes written as *qiàn* (辁).
*Qiàn* (辁) means "to measure" or "to assess others."
Originally, it was also written as *qú* (軨), meaning "small."
It was also written as *qiāng* (轻).

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Qiàn* (辁) – pronounced *qī quán* (七全) or *zhěn* (砚) *zhuān* (专), also *quán* (权).
Li [Fan] says: *Qiàn* (辁), meaning "to assess others," was originally also written as *qú* (軨).
*Qiàn* (辁) – pronounced *fāng fèng* (方凤), meaning "to recite and explain."

---

*Lěi* (累) – fine fishing line.
*Niányú* (鲵鲋) – small fish.
With slender poles and fine lines,
hurrying along irrigation ditches,
they might catch *niányú* (鲵鲋),
but never the great fish.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Jiē* (揭) – pronounced *qí liè* (其列) or *qí yè* (其谒).
*Gān lěi* (竿累) – pronounced *liè bǐ* (劣彼), meaning "unable to match the strength of others."

*Gān* (干) – to seek.
*Xiàn* (县) – to be high or exalted.
Those who adorn minor actions,
boast in speech,
seeking fame and renown—
they shall never grasp the *Dàodé* (至道) of the Dao/Way.

The character *xiàn* (县) is sometimes written as *xuán* (悬).
Ancient *xuán* (悬) often lacked the radical *xīn* (心).

---

**Zhu** (注):
This speaks of differing aspirations,
thus the suitability for governing the world
varies with the great and the small.

**Cushu:**
Between human affairs in the world,
the Dao/Way is not always smooth or perilous.
Only those with open hearts and boundless understanding
can address chaos and order.
Those who seek fame and adorn their conduct
are far removed from this.

**Jiao** (校):
(1) The character *wù* (骛) follows the *Shì Dé Táng* (世德堂) edition and is corrected.
Zhao (赵) the *Jiàn Yì* (谏议) writes it as *jīng* (惊).
(2) Zhao’s edition writes *zhù* (趣) as *qú* (趋).
(3) The character *qiú* (求) follows the *Shì Dé Táng* (世德堂) edition and is corrected.
The characters *tú* (徒) *mò* (末) and *yàn* (砚) below are the same.

The scholars, when opening a tomb with *Shī Lǐ* (诗礼),
the great scholars recite in sequence:
*"The east has arisen, what is the Way to govern it?"*
**Cushu:**
Great scholars (大儒) – eminent scholars, referring to the Grand Masters (大博士).
To tell the students from above is called *lú* (胪).
*Lú* (胪) – to recite or transmit.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
**First Note:**
Great scholars (大儒) – eminent scholars, referring to the Grand Masters (大博士).
To transmit words from above to below is called *lú* (胪).
*Lú* (胪) – to recite or transmit.

---

The east has arisen—this refers to the dawn when the light of the sun begins.
The **Daoist** disciples, upon opening a tomb, fearing the dawn’s approach, hasten to warn one another, asking how they might proceed in their thievery.
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Lú* (胪) – read as *lì yú fǎn* (力于反), or alternatively as *lū* (卢).
Su Lin’s annotation of the *Hàn Shū* (汉书) states: When words are transmitted from above to below, it is called *lú* (胪).
*Lú* (胪) – also means "to proceed" or "to act."
*Lú* (胪) – read as *zhì luàn fǎn* (治恋反), or *zhàng zhuān fǎn* (丈专反).
Xiàng (向) says: When words are transmitted from above to below, it is called *lú* (胪) *zhuàn* (传).
*Lú* (胪) – read as *zhì luàn fǎn* (治恋反), meaning "hasten" or "urgently."
*Dōngfāng zuò yǐ* (东方作矣) – Sīmǎ (司马) says: This refers to the sun’s rising.

The lesser **Daoist** disciples say:
*"My robe and skirt are yet unsolved,
Yet my mouth contains a pearl [1]—
The **Dao** fixedly declares:
‘The green-green wheat grows on the mound and slope,
Unpaired in life, why then in death hold pearls? [2]’
Grasp its hair, press [1] its forehead—
The **Daoist** scholars strike with a golden mallet at its chin,
Slowly part its cheeks,
Lest the pearl in its mouth be harmed [3]!”*

**Exegesis of Terms:**
[1] Lesser **Daoist** disciples—these are the disciples.
The dead person’s skirt and robe are still unsolved, and upon touching its mouth, one knows it contains a precious pearl.
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Rú* (襦) – read as *wú zhū fǎn* (而朱反).

[2] This is a lost poem, long since deleted.
Generally, when the noble are buried, their mouths often contain pearls, so the disciples recite the *Qīngqīng zhī mài* (青青之麦) poem to censure this practice.
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Qīngqīng zhī mài* (青青之麦) – Sīmǎ (司马) says: This is a lost poem, censuring the dead.
*Líng pī* (陵陂) – read as *bǐ yí fǎn* (彼宜反).
*Bùshī* (布施) – read as *shǐ shì fǎn* (始豉反).

[3] **Annotation:**
The *Shī Lǐ* (诗礼) are the traces left by the ancient kings.
If not the proper person, the **Dao** does not act in vain—
thus, when the **Daoist** scholars are used for wickedness, the traces are insufficient to rely upon [2].
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*Jiē* (接) – to grasp.
*Àn* (按) – to press.

「**顪**—the mouth. **控**—to strike.

To grasp his temples, press his mouth, strike with an iron plantain—
yet still fearing damage to the pearl—
so they do it gently and with distinction.

Thus, **田恒** (Tián Héng) stole from **齐** (Qí) under the guise of **仁义** (benevolence and righteousness),
while **儒生** (scholars) recited the *Shī Lǐ* (poetry and rites) to justify grave-robbing;
from this, one sees that **圣迹** (the traces of the sages) are not to be trusted.

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*《压》*—also written as **压** (yā), same pronunciation.
*《乃协》*—read as *nǎi xié* (乃协反).
*《郭于琰》*—read as *guō yú yǎn* (郭于琰反), or *chì jiá* (敕颊反).
*《其顪》*—also written as **哕** (huì), read as *xū huì* (许秽反).
*Sīmǎ* (司马) says: The **顪** (yǎn) refers to the hair beneath the chin (i.e., the beard).
*《金椎》*—read as *jīn zhuī* (直追反).

**Annotation by 王念孙 (Wáng Niànsūn):**
The **儒** (scholars) strike his **顪** (yǎn) with an iron plantain;
the *Yìwén Lèijú* (艺文类聚) under the *Bǎoyù* (宝玉) section cites this,
where **儒** (rú) is written as **而** (ér)—this is correct.
**而** (ér)—thou/you (addressing someone).

From the point where I do not yet understand the *kùn rú* (解裙襦) below,
all are the words of a lesser scholar replying to a greater one.

You say: *"Thou strikest his beard with an iron plantain,
gently parting his cheeks,
lest thou harm the pearl within his mouth."*

Yet the pronunciation of **儒** (rú) and **而** (ér) is similar,
and the text above contains many instances of **儒** (rú),
so **而** (ér) was mistakenly written as **儒** (rú).

*《控》*—read as *kū jiāng* (苦江反).
*《徐别》*—read as *xú bié* (彼列反).

**Collation Notes:**
(1) 赵谏议 (Zhào Jiànyì) reads **压** (yā).
(2) 世德堂 (Shì Dé Táng) reads **持** (chí) instead of **恃** (shì).

A disciple of **老莱子** (Lǎo Lái Zǐ), while gathering firewood (**出薪**), encountered **仲尼** (Zhòngní),
and returned to report (**反以告**) [1]:

*"There is a man yonder—
his stature is tall above, yet short below [2],
his shoulders hunched, his ears receding behind [3],
his gaze sweeping as though surveying the Four Seas [4],
yet I know not his lineage or surname [5]."*

**Exegesis of Terms:**
*《老莱子》*—a person from **楚** (Chǔ).
*《出薪》*—to go out and gather firewood.

[2] **Annotation:** His upper body is long, his lower body short.
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*《趋下》*—pronounced as *cù* (促).
*Lǐ Yún* (李云) says: The lower body is short.

[3] **Annotation:** His ears recede toward the back, while his upper body bends forward.
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*《末偻》*—Lǐ Yún (李云) says: *"末上"* (mò shàng)—the forehead, referring to the front of the head,
or *"背膂"* (bèi lǚ)—the hunched back.
*Sīmǎ* (司马) says: His ears recede toward the back.
*《却近》*—nearness in retreat (附近之近).

[4] **Annotation:** His appearance is so solemn, as though he were scheming for others' affairs.
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*《视若营四海》*—A man who labors his body and strains his mind to respond to worldly duties,
losing his natural state.
Thus, **尧** (Yáo) had the metaphor of the *"亢龙"* (kānglóng, soaring dragon),
**舜** (Shùn) spoke of the *"卷偻"* (juǎn lǚ, hunched figure),
**周公** (Zhōugōng) likened him to a *"走狼"* (zǒuláng, prowling wolf),
and **仲尼** (Zhòngní) compared him to an *"逸狗"* (yìgǒu, stray dog)—
how could such descriptions not be credible?

*《儡》*—read as *lǚ* (律悲反), *yú guǐ* (旧鱼鬼反), or *yú wēi* (又鱼威反).

[5] **Exegesis of Terms:**
*《修》*—long.
*《趋》*—short.
*《末》*—shoulders and back.
The man observed:
his lower body is short, his upper body long,
his shoulders and back hunched,
his ears receding toward the back,
his gaze distant and lofty,
his bearing as though he were surveying the world—
yet I do not know his clan or surname.
Struck by his unusual appearance,
so I raise this question.

**Collation Notes:**
(1) The text is incorrectly cited from **张君房** (Zhāng Jūnfáng), with an erroneous **"拾"** (shí) character inserted below **出**.

**老莱子** said:
*"That is **丘** (Qiū)—
summon him hither [1]."*

**仲尼** (Zhòngní) arrived and spoke:
*"Qiū! Forsake thy artificial adornments and forget thy contrived appearance—
thus shalt thou be a **君子** (gentleman) [1]."*

[1] **Annotation:** It refers to **仲尼** (Zhòngní) being able to abandon his physical form and forget his knowledge,
thereby qualifying as a **君子** (gentleman).
**Exegesis of Terms:**
*《躬》*—the body.
Since **孔丘** (Kǒng Qiū) had arrived,
**老莱** (Lǎo Lái) addressed him:
*"Thou shouldst abandon thy body’s embellishments,
forget thy contrived appearance and inner scheming—
at such a moment, thou mayest be a **君子** (gentleman)."*

*《去》*—read as *qǐ lǚ* (起吕反).
**Annotation:** Same as above.

「《而》 (originally written as 女, now as 汝)
◎ Lu Wēnbiān (Lú Wēnbiān) remarked: "In modern texts, it is written as 汝."

**仲尼** (Zhòngní) bowed and withdrew [1],
his brow furrowed in alarm as he changed his expression and asked:
*"May one’s **业** (practice/virtue) [2] attain further progress?"

[1] **Annotation:** He received the words respectfully.
**Exegesis:** With reverence, he received the words and withdrew with a bow.

[2] **Annotation:** He inquired whether the **圣迹** (sage’s deeds) and **业行** (practices) of **仲尼** could be refined and applied for the benefit of the world.
**Exegesis:** The **业** here refers to the **圣迹** (sage’s deeds) and **业行** (virtuous practices) of **仲尼**—could they be further cultivated and put to use in the world?

**老莱子** (Lǎo Lái Zǐ) replied:
*"He who does not endure the harm of one age but **骜** (causes to be driven away) [1] the calamity of ten thousand ages—
is this not a fixed error?
Or has he lost the essence of his teachings and failed to grasp their intent? [2]

[1] **Annotation:** *惠* (huì, benevolent) and *欢* (huān, joy) are mistakenly conflated as *骜* (áo, arrogant/overbearing).
The shame of a lifetime’s folly [3],
the conduct of the common man—
it is merely a **进** (advancement) in one’s **名** (reputation) [4],
to **相引** (cite one another) [5] with fame,
and to **相结** (bind one another) [6] in secrecy.

Better to **两忘** (forget both) and **闭** (seal) what one praises
than to extol **尧** (Yáo) while condemning **桀** (Jié).
To act is to invite harm;
to move is to invite **邪** (evil/erroneousness). [7]

The **圣人** (sage) deliberates before undertaking any matter,
and each success is achieved with measured reflection. [8]
Why then does he **载** (carry) [9] this **终矜** (eternal adornment) [10] upon himself?
It is only to embellish thy **躬** (body)!" [11]

[1] **Annotation:** If one’s actions bring harm to the present age,
then their consequences will plague future generations—
thus, one should not act lightly.

[2] **Exegesis:** The **圣智仁义** (sage’s wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness)
may heal the suffering of the present age,
but if later generations take them as **奸** (deceitful),
they will become the cause of **祸** (calamity) for ten thousand ages.
Relying on the **圣迹** (sage’s deeds) to be arrogant,
one becomes like the **陈恒** (Chén Héng) [12]—
a fixed error indeed.
Some texts write this as *骛* (áo, also meaning "to drive away"), suggesting
that the deeds will cause endless turmoil for future generations.

[3] **Annotation:** *骜* (áo) is also written as *敖* (áo).
Five *报* (bào, retribution) readings.
Same below.

[4] **Exegesis:** *终矜* (eternal adornment) refers to the lasting embellishment of oneself.
Same below.

[5] **Annotation:** The shame of a lifetime’s folly—
the **中民** (common man) [13] merely advances his name
through such conduct.

[6] **Annotation:** *相引以名* (to cite one another with fame)
and *相结以隐* (to bind one another in secrecy).

[7] **Annotation:** *反* (fǎn, to act) is to invite harm;
*动* (dòng, to move) is to invite **邪** (evil/erroneousness).

[8] **Annotation:** *以每成功* (and each success is achieved)
through careful deliberation.

[9] **Annotation:** *载* (zài, to undertake).

[10] **Annotation:** *终矜* (eternal adornment).

[11] **Annotation:** *终矜尔* (eternal adornment upon himself)
is only to embellish thy **躬** (body).

[12] **Annotation:** *陈恒* (Chén Héng) refers to a historical figure known for arrogance.

[13] **Annotation:** *中民* (common man) refers to ordinary people.

「**[2] Annotation:** Stubbornly adhering to the traces of the Sage,
raising some while suppressing others according to one’s own will,
deviating from innate nature—
thus one falls into **窭** (poverty/impoverishment).

**[3] Annotation:** If one simply entrusts [matters] directly,
then the people’s innate nature will not be impoverished,
and all things will naturally be as they should—
no task will remain unattended.

**[Citation & Commentary]**
To lose one’s innate nature,
to neglect the fundamental roots—
thus one fails to reach the True Dao.

◎ *Family Tradition (家世父)*:
Not bearing to cause harm in one’s own time,
yet leaving ruin for ages—
one fancies oneself capable of governing the world,
yet knows not that his heart lacks any true preparation.
To lack preparation is to be **窭** (impoverished);
his wisdom and strategy also fall short.

Guo Xiang remarks:
*"If one simply entrusts [matters] directly,
then the people’s innate nature will not be impoverished,
and all things will naturally be as they should—
no task will remain unattended."*
This seems to stray from Zhuangzi’s original intent.

◎ *Regulation by Qingfan (庆藩案)*:
*"亡"* (wáng) is read as *"无"* (wú).
*"亡其"* is a rhetorical turn.
*Records of the Grand Historian, Biographies of Fan Sui and Cai Zhaozhao*:
*"亡其"*—does this mean the minister is despised and unusable?
(*Zhu Shu*: "亡" means to slight or scorn; the meaning is unclear.)
*Lüshi Chunqiu, Love of Kindred*:
*"亡其"*—should we not attack Rong Qi for his injustice?
*Han Strategy*:
*"亡其"*—should we abandon the art of filial conduct and neglect the rites of mourning?
Thus, whenever *"亡其"* appears, it is a rhetorical device.

---

**[4] Annotation:** If kindness brings joy,
then without kindness, one is **丑** (ugly/repulsive).
Yet kindness cannot be sustained indefinitely—
thus, a single act of kindness brings lifelong shame.

**[Commentary]**
Those who take delight in bestowing kindness
cannot extend it universally,
so arrogance and negligence abound.
Thus, using kindness to win over others
only creates a reservoir of resentment—
a lifelong source of shame and disgrace.

---

**[5] Annotation:** If one speaks of how easily one may advance,
then one must not recklessly bestow kindness.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"之行"* (zhīxíng) – *"行"* (xíng) as in *"行"* (xíng, to go), *"之"* (zhī) with *"孟"* (mèng) tone.
*"其易"* (qíyì) – *"易"* (yì) as in *"豉"* (shǐ).

---

**[6] Annotation:** *隐* (hidden) means *括* (to correct crookedness);
this is what is meant by *"progress"* (进).

**[Commentary]**
The wise and the foolish alike—
their natures are difficult to alter.
The mediocre, however, are easily swayed.
Thus, when they hear of Yao’s virtues,
they cite one another in emulation for fame,
and when they hear of Jie’s wickedness,
they bind themselves in secrecy.

**[Phonetic Gloss & Variants]**
*"相结以隐"* (xiāngjié yǐ yǐn):
Guo Xiang says: *"隐"* (yǐn) means *"括"* (kuò, to correct).
Li says: *"隐"* (yǐn) means *"病患"* (illness).
Though they cite one another for fame,
they also bind themselves through shared affliction.

◎ *Yu Ruo* remarks:
Li’s claim that *"隐"* means *"病患"* (illness)
is incorrect—illness is not what binds them.
Guo’s explanation that *"隐"* means *"括"* (to correct)
is also off—correcting crookedness is not what binds them.
*"隐"* should be interpreted as *"私"* (private/selfish).
In *Lüshi Chunqiu, Round Paths*, *"不相隐"* (not concealing from one another),
Gao Heng annotates: *"隐"* means *"私"* (private).
In *Wen Xuan, The Red and White Horse*, *"恩隐周渥"* (favor concealed in depth),
Li Shan cites *Guo Yu*: *"隐"* means *"私"* (private).
Thus, *"相结以隐"* means *"to bind through private favor."*
All prior interpretations are incorrect.

**[7] Annotation:** *闭* (closed) means *闭塞* (blocked/obstructed).

**[Commentary]**
To praise Yao’s Dao without condemning Jie’s deeds—
to rush about in this manner is to invite the depletion of one’s nature.
Thus, it is better to forget both good and evil,
to block out praise and blame,
so that all things may remain whole.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"誉尧"* (yù Yáo) – *"誉"* (yù) as in *"余"* (yú).
*"而闭"* (ér bì) – some manuscripts read *"门"* (mén, gate) instead.

**[8] Annotation:** Follow [nature], and it will be whole;
remain still, and it will be upright.

**[Commentary]**
To act contrary to innate nature
brings only harm.
To agitate the mind
invites only **邪** (erroneousness/evil).

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"反无非伤也"* (fǎn wú fēi shāng yě) – *"反"* (fǎn) means *"逆于理"* (contrary to principle).
*"动无非邪也"* (dòng wú fēi xié yě) – *"动"* (dòng) as in *"嗟"* (jiē), *"邪"* (xié) as in *"矜"* (jīn).

---

**[9] Annotation:** Affairs should not stray from their roots—
thus, each success is achieved.

**[Commentary]**
With deliberate pacing and ease,
the Sage acts without contrivance,
responding to circumstances while naturally arising.
His undertakings are always serene,
never opposing the natural order—
thus, his achievements are ever fulfilled.

**[Phonetic Gloss]**
*"圣人踌"* (shèngrén chóu) – *"踌"* (chóu) as in *"畴"* (chóu).
*"躇"* (chú) – *"直居"* (zhí jū).
*"以兴事以每成功"* (yǐ xīng shì yǐ měi chénggōng) – *"每"* (měi) means *"each time"* or *"whenever."*
*"踌躇"* (chóu chú) means *"from容"* (ease).
Though his undertakings succeed,
the Sage does not cling to them—
yet the harm lingers for centuries.
How much worse when one boasts of virtuous deeds
and endlessly records them!

*"不远"* (bù yuǎn) – *"远"* (yuǎn) as in *"万"* (wàn).

---

**[10] Annotation:** *矜* (adornment) cannot be sustained—
thus, it is abandoned and not possessed.

**[Commentary]**
*柰何* (nǎihé) – *"如何"* (rúhé, how).
How can one cling to the traces of *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness),
agitating the hearts of others,
endlessly recording one’s adornments—
never ceasing for a lifetime!
These are the words Lao Lai used to reproach Confucius.

◎ *Family Tradition (家世父)*:
*"反"* (fǎn) means *"to reverse chaos and restore order."*
To act against nature is to invite harm;
to move is to invite **邪** (erroneousness).
His *"反"* (reversal) is the *矜* (adornment) of the heart in contention;
his *"动"* (movement) is the *矜* (adornment) of the heart in display.
If one lets things transform naturally,
there will be no harm.
If one acts without action,
there will be no **邪** (erroneousness).

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) The transmitted text incorrectly cites Zhang Cheng’s version with *"易"* (yì) missing below *"行"* (xíng).
(2) The Tang-era manuscript omits *"终"* (zhōng) above *"矜"* (jīn).

*[Dream of the Ruler of Song]*
One night, the ruler of Song (conferred the posthumous name *Yuan*, i.e., *Song Yuanjun*)
dreamed that a man with unbound hair peered through his gate,
saying:
*"I came from the depths of the Zhai Road,
I was the envoy of Qingjiang,
sent by the River Spirit—
the fisherman Yu Qi captured me."*

**[1] [Commentary]**
The ruler of Song, posthumously named *Yuan*,

When the *Song Yuanjun* awoke, he inquired of a diviner, who replied:
*"This is a divine turtle."*
The ruler asked:
*"Is there a fisherman named Yú Jié?"*
His attendants answered:
*"There is."*

The ruler said:
*"Summon **Yú Jié** to attend court tomorrow."*

The next day, **Yú Jié** came to court. The ruler asked:
*"What did you catch in your fishing?"*
He replied:
*"My net caught a divine white turtle, five feet in circumference."*

The ruler said:
*"Present your turtle."*
When the turtle arrived, the ruler twice wished to kill it and twice wished to spare it. In doubt, he consulted the diviner, who said:
*"Kill the turtle to divine for auspicious fortune."*
So he carved the turtle, piercing it seventy-two times—but no oracle markings remained.

Confucius said:
*"The divine tortoise could be seen in dreams by the Primordial Lord, yet could not evade the net of Yu Jie;
The sage could endure seventy-two scorings yet yield no divination marks, yet could not avoid the calamity of being disemboweled.
Thus, even the wise have their limits—spirit and knowledge alike have their constraints.

Though one’s wisdom be supreme, it cannot outmaneuver the schemes of ten thousand men.
The fish fears not the net, but the cormorant.
To abandon petty knowledge is to illuminate the Great Knowing;
To abandon what is merely ‘good’ is to attain true virtue.

An infant, born without a stone teacher, still speaks—
For it dwells among those who speak.

**[Annotations]**
**[1]** Spirit and wisdom are not to be relied upon in this way. Only he who remains still, dwelling within his own capacities and not scheming beyond them, is whole.
**[Citation]** Spirit and wisdom are indeed unreliable. Thus, the sage in the world forgets form, spirit, wisdom, and calculation, aligning with withered wood in its lack of adornment, and with dead ashes in its stillness. He entrusts himself to the mysterious workings of Nature—hence, even Confucius, the great sage, spoke thus in accordance with this truth.

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*Jiànmèng* (见梦): pronounced *xián biàn* (贤遍反).
*Zhīnéng* (知能): pronounced *zhì* (智), same as below and in the annotation."*

**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*Zhīyǒu suǒ kùn* (至知): pronounced *zhì* (智). Same as below and in the annotation.

**[3]** **[Annotation]** A net has no sentience, yet it catches fish.
**[Citation]** A net lacks sentience yet captures fish—
*This illustrates* the Sage’s lack of scheming, so all under Heaven returns to him.
**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*Tiǎo* (鹈): pronounced *tú xī* (徒兮)反. *Hú* (鹕): a waterbird, also called *Táohé* (淘河).

**[4]** **[Annotation]** Small knowledge is selfish, great knowledge aligns with Nature.
**[Citation]** Small knowledge takes or rejects based on its own desires, while great knowledge is free from distinctions. It discards the idle and seizes the urgent, thus without distinctions, great knowledge shines brightly.
**[Phonetic Glosses]**
*Qù xiǎo* (去小): pronounced *qǐ lǚ* (起吕)反. Same as below and in the annotation.

**[5]** **[Annotation]** To abandon virtue is to let virtue have nothing to aspire to; when virtue has nothing to aspire to, those who possess virtue do not contrive but are naturally virtuous.
**[Citation]** To cast aside the petty pride of seeking virtue, and to embrace the great virtue of Nature—hence the earlier passage states: *"Separate from the Dao/Way to seek virtue, perilous to rely on actions alone."* And also the *Laozi* says: *"When all under Heaven knows virtue as virtue, then it is not virtue."*

「**[1]** **[Explanation]**
The pursuit of utility leads to the same fate as premature death, while true non-utility preserves life’s fullness. Hence, one must first comprehend non-utility before understanding its use.

**[2]** **[Explanation]**
*Dì* (垫), pronounced *jué* (掘), means to dig. Within the six directions of space, the earth is vast without bounds, yet human utility only requires enough room to fit one’s feet. If one were to dig beyond where the feet rest and plunge down to the Yellow Springs, a person would tremble in fear and be unable to move. Thus, it is clear that what is deemed useful is only so because of the *non*-utility of the rest.

**[Textual Notes]**
*《厕足》* (厕足): pronounced *cè zú* (侧足) or *shì zú* (测足).
*《垫》* (垫): pronounced *dīng* (丁)反.
*《致黄泉》* (致黄泉): *zhì* (致) means "to reach"; *zhì* (至) is also used.

Zhuangzi said: *"Thus, the utility of non-utility is also clear."*

**[1]** **[Commentary]**
The Sage aligns with the inner [truths], responding to circumstances as they arise; yet when speaking of the outer [perspectives], He expands upon the principles of things. When the heart is clear, actions flow; when the outer is illuminated, the inner is applied. This is the mutual reliance of such reasoning.

**[Explanation]**
If one simply stands within the space that fits the feet, movement is impossible. One must borrow additional ground to freely use one’s feet. The logic of non-utility is evident—hence Zhuangzi takes the *Laozi*’s words: *"To have is to gain advantage; to not have is to find utility."* He says:

*"Can a person who knows how to swim also choose not to swim? Can a person who does not know how to swim also swim?"*
**[1]** **[Commentary]**
What aligns with one’s nature cannot be avoided; what does not align with one’s nature cannot be forced. Thus, the Sage does not impose rigid rules, and all things naturally harmonize without knowing how they do so.

**[Explanation]**
People inherit different natures, and their uses vary accordingly. Some respond to words like an echo, while others are dull as if deaf to even beans and millet. Thus, what one’s nature can do must follow its own path; what one’s nature cannot do must not be forcibly pursued. Each guards its own domain, and thus nothing is lost.

**[Textual Notes]**
*《得强》* (得强): pronounced *dé qiáng* (其丈)反.

**[2]** **[Commentary]**
Only those with profound virtue and depth can truly bear such resolve and act upon it while trusting in their unique capacities.

**[Explanation]**
To drift along with desires, flee without return, decisively sever all ties, and remain unshaken by consequences—such resolve and actions are the mark of utter foolishness and vulgarity. How could they be the task of the most refined, true wisdom, or the profoundest virtue?

**[Textual Notes]**
*《之行》* (之行): pronounced *zhī xíng* (下孟)反.
*《任与》* (任与): pronounced *rèn yú* (余).

**[3]** **[Commentary]**
What humans take pleasure in, they do not shun even when it involves right or wrong, life or death.

**[Explanation]**
The foolish and deluded cling resolutely to their desires. Even if their homes are ruined and their bodies fall into disaster, they do not repent. They chase after worldly passions with the urgency of blazing fire, yet never look back. Wandering and fleeing with decisive resolve, they reach such extremes.

**[Textual Notes]**
*《覆坠》* (覆坠): pronounced *fù zhuì* (直类)反.
*《所好》* (所好): pronounced *suǒ hào* (呼报)反.

**[4]** **[Commentary]**
This is why they are called the "Great Equality" (齐同).

**[Explanation]**
Those who are esteemed by the times become rulers, while those whose talents do not fit the age become subjects—like Shun and Yu, who succeeded each other in accordance with the times. Thus, when the world changes, one cannot degrade those who once were rulers or subjects. The wandering and fleeing ones do not understand this.

**[5]** **[Commentary]**
The Sage follows the circumstances of the moment, thus able to move with the transformations of the world.

**[Explanation]**
The world has its rise and fall; the Sage moves with it. Hence, the enlightened never linger or stagnate.

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) The Tang manuscript lacks the word *yě* (也).
(2) The Zhao manuscript lacks the word *zé* (则).

(3) The *Shìdétáng* (世德堂) manuscript reads: *"This is why they are called the 'Great Equality' (齐) in humanity."* Zhao’s version reads: *"This is why they are called the 'Great Equality' (齐)."* Here, *qí* (齐) means "the same."

The Sage, who holds no reverence for the past nor contempt for the present, is the true student. Yet when observing the followers of the *Yǔwéi* (狶韦) tradition—those who venerate ancient emperors—how could one not be swayed by the times? Only the Sage can swim freely through the world without constraint, following others while never losing oneself.
**[3]** **[Commentary]**
The Sage adapts to the times, and wherever one stands, that is the right path.

**[Textual Notes]**
*《不僻》* (不僻): pronounced *bù pì* (匹亦)反.

**[4]** **[Commentary]**
The Sage has no fixed self to lose.

**[5]** **[Commentary]**
Teaching follows the nature of the student; thus, it is not a matter of learning.

**[6]** **[Commentary]**
The Sage accepts the natural intentions of others, hence the *Laozi* says: *"All things flourish in their own way."*»

Those who teach do not instruct, and those who accept intentions do not force conformity.

「**[Commentary]**
Only the Sage of supreme *virtue/power* (德) can harmonize with the times and transform others—this is not a matter of learned intention but of inherent nature, fully present from the start. To accept others' intentions without forcing conformity is to embrace their teachings and guide their nature, while the true *Dao/Way* (道) remains ever-rounded, never constrained by instruction.

**[Textual Notes]**
(一) The Tang manuscript lacks the character *乃* (乃).
(二) The *Zhào Jiànyì* (赵谏议) text corrects *政* (政) to *政* (正).

The eyes perceive clearly as *明* (ming), the ears hear distinctly as *聪* (cóng), the nose discerns as *颤* (chàn), the mouth tastes as *甘* (gān), the heart comprehends as *知* (zhī), and when *知* (zhī) is fully realized, it becomes *德* (virtue/power). **[1]**
The *Dao/Way* (道) does not wish to be obstructed—when obstructed, it stagnates; when stagnated and not resolved, it leads to *跈* **[2]** (conflict/contrariness), and when in *跈* (跈), all manner of harm arises. **[3]**
Those who possess *知* (discernment) rely on *息* (breath/qi)—when their *息* (breath/qi) is not harmonious, it is not the fault of *天* (Heaven). **[4] **[5]**
*天* (Heaven) continuously *穿* (penetrates/pervades) them, ceasing neither day nor night—yet people often block their own *窦* (pores/orifices). **[6] **[7]**
The body has layers of *阆* (obstructions), the heart wanders in *天游* (Heavenly Roaming). **[8] **[9]**
When the chamber is not open and clear, *妇姑* (wives and sisters-in-law) grow restless; when the heart lacks *天游* (Heavenly Roaming), the six *凿* (pores/senses) contend with one another, **[10] **[11]**
And even the vast forests and towering mountains, though beneficial to humanity, cannot overcome *神者* (divine obstruction). **[12]**

**[1] [Commentary]**
*彻* (chè) means "penetrating/complete." *颤* (chàn) refers to the perception of sharp and foul odors. When the six *根* (senses) are not obstructed, they penetrate fully; when *聪明* (clarity and wisdom) are not swayed by external influences, they manifest as *德* (virtue/power). **[Textual Notes]**
*《颤》* (颤): pronounced *shū yán* (舒延)反.

**[2] [Commentary]**
When the *Dao/Way* (道) should flow but is blocked, the natural order becomes stifled and contends in *跈* (跈). **[Textual Notes]**
*《哽》* (哽): pronounced *gēng méng* (庚猛)反, meaning "blocked/stagnated."
*《跈》* (跈): pronounced *nǚ zhǎn* (女展)反.
Guō (郭) says: "It means *践* (to tread)." *Guǎng Yǎ* (广雅) says: "It means *履* (to step) or *止* (to stop)." The text may also be written as *蹍* (同), but this is incorrect.
◎ *Wáng Niànsūn* (王念孙) says: "Guō's commentary, 'When it should flow but is blocked, the natural order becomes stifled and contends in *跈*,' is convoluted. The *Guǎng Yǎ* (广雅) explanation of *履* (to step) or *止* (to stop) does not align with the meaning of obstruction. The correct reading is *跈* (chè) as *抮* (tì), meaning *戾* (contrariness). When stagnation does not cease, it leads to *抮* (tì), and when in *抮* (tì), all manner of harm arises. *Guǎng Yǎ* (广雅) says: *抮* (tì) is *盭* (同). *Fāngyán* (方言) says: *轸* (zhěn) is *戾* (contrariness). Guō Pǔ (郭璞) says: 'It means to contend and reach a resolution.' In the *Mèngzǐ* (《孟子》), *Jié zǐ piān* (《告子篇》), *wǎn xiōngdì zhī bì* (紾兄之臂) while *duó qí shí* (奪之食), *Zhào Jì* (赵岐) says: *wǎn* (紾) is *戾* (contrariness). This aligns with the meaning here: 'When stagnation does not cease, it leads to *抮* (tì).'"

**[3] [Commentary]**
*生* (shēng) means "to arise."

**[4] [Commentary]**
The six *根* (senses) are inherently without *知* (discernment)—they do not rely on *息* (breath/qi).

**[Commentary]**
*天* (Heaven) bestows the six *根* (senses), and neglecting any one of them is not permissible. Hearing through the ears, seeing through the eyes, smelling through the nose, and knowing through the heart are all within their proper functions—using them appropriately is without fault. However, if the eyes linger on the colors of the *Sāng zhōng* (桑中), the ears indulge in the sounds of the *Lú shàng* (濮上), the nose is captivated by the fragrances of *lán xiè* (兰麝), or the heart is entranced by boundless *境* (scenes/realms), then the natural order of *天* (Heaven) is extinguished—how could this be called *彻* (penetrating)? Thus, when the six *根* (senses) are fully realized and penetrating, the *息* (breath/qi) flows freely and the vital functions are complete.

**[5] [Commentary]**
*殷* (yīn) means "harmonious/right." When *息* (breath/qi) does not arise from *知* (discernment), it is *知* (discernment) that leads to its disharmony; when disharmony occurs, the flow is obstructed. Thus, *知* (discernment) relies on *息* (breath/qi), but *息* (breath/qi) does not rely on *知* (discernment). Still, the application of *知* (discernment) is governed by the individual—it is not a matter of external compulsion.

**[Commentary]**
Some indulge the six *根* (senses) and chase after external *境* (scenes/realms); others block their *窍穴* (pores/orifices), harming their *生* (life). Both *通* (penetrating) and *蹍* (stagnating) are deviations from the *Dao/Way* (道)—these are all faults of human nature, not inherent in *天* (Heaven). **[Textual Notes]**
*《不殷》* (不殷): pronounced as *不* (bù) *殷* (yīn), or alternatively *于靳* (yú jìn)反.

**[6] [Commentary]**
The *Dao/Way* (道) has a constant, natural flow.

**[Commentary]**
*降* (jiàng) means "to stop." The natural order of *天* (Heaven) continuously *穿* (penetrates/pervades) all things, from day to night, never ceasing. ◎ *Jiāshì Fù* (家世父) says: "Those who possess *知* (discernment) rely on *息* (breath/qi)—*息* (breath/qi) is *气* (qi), and since *气* (qi) varies in purity and thickness, *天* (Heaven) cannot force uniformity upon it. *Ěryǎ* (尔雅) explains *殷* (yīn) as *齐* (zhī, uniformity), *中* (zhōng, harmony). When uniformity is achieved, harmony follows; when uniformity cannot be achieved, it is due to *天* (Heaven)'s lack of intervention. Yet *天* (Heaven) grants them the hundred *骸* (hái, limbs) and nine *窍* (pores) and commands them to move naturally, and grants them *心思* (xīnsī, mind and thought) and commands them to transform naturally—its purpose is merely to open and clear the way. *Shuōwén* (说文): *穿* (chuān) means "to penetrate." When there is ample space for self-preservation, the flow is unrestricted. *Yùpiàn* (玉篇): *降* (jiàng) means "to submit." It states that the accumulation of *气* (qi) never ceases or submits. Guō Xiàng (郭象) incorrectly comments that *殷* (yīn) means 'harmonious/right.'"」

「◎ Mr. Yu Yue remarked: *降* (jiàng) should be written as □, i.e., the *zhòuwén* (ancient script) form of *癃* (làng, urinary retention).

In the *Suwen* (素问) *Xuān míng wǔqì* (宣明五气) chapter, *bǎngguāng* (膀胱, bladder) not functioning smoothly is called *làng* (癃), and in the *Wǔcháng zhèngdà* (五常政大) chapter, it states that its ailment is *làng* and *bì* (闭, obstruction). To have no □ means not to be obstructed by *bì* (闭).

**[7]**
**[Annotation]** Without emotional constraints, one follows Heaven’s Way.
**[Commentary]** *Dòu* (窦, orifice), refers to *kǒng* (孔, hole).
The common people go against Heaven’s principles, blocking their root orifices, causing stagnation and drowning in unnatural obstruction.

**[Reading Guide]** *其窦* (qí dòu) pronounced as *dòu* (豆, like "dough").

**[8]**
**[Annotation]** *Làng* (阆) means spacious and vast.
**[Commentary]** *Làng* (阆) means empty.
It says that the human abdomen is empty, thus it can contain the stomach, and the stomach being empty allows *qi* (气) and fluids to pass through.

**[Reading Guide]** *胞* (pú) pronounced as *普交* (pǔ-qiào, like "poke"), meaning the fetus in the womb.
*有重* (yǒu zhòng) pronounced as *直龙* (zhí-lóng, like "jig-long").
*阆* (làng) pronounced as *浪* (làng, like "lang").
Guo (郭) said: spacious and vast.

**[Commentary]** *Yóu* (游) refers to emptiness.
Thus, the Dao/Way of Nature flows freely within it.

**[10]**
**[Annotation]** *Zhēng* (争) means contention over space.
**[Commentary]** *Bó* (勃) means contention or strife.
When rooms are not spacious, they cannot accommodate guests, so wives and mothers-in-law contend over living quarters, erasing distinctions of respect.

**[Reading Guide]** *勃* (bó) pronounced as *奚* (xī, like "hee").
*勃* (bó), contention.

*相攘* (xiāng rǎng) pronounced as *如羊* (rú-yáng, like "ru-yang").
Guo (郭) said: opposition.
Master Sima (司马) remarked: the six emotions contend and usurp.

◎ Mr. Qing Fan annotated: In the *Aigōng* (哀公) chapter of *Xúnzǐ* (荀子), Master Sima remarked: the six emotions contend and usurp. This differs from the *Reading Guide* by adding one *相* (xiāng, mutual) character.

**[12]**
**[Annotation]** The principles of Nature have places where things rest and flow freely.
**[Commentary]** The principles of Nature indeed have places where things rest and flow freely.

◎ Mr. Jia Shìfù remarked: The virtue/power of great forests and mountains lies in their benefit to humanity, meaning they bring joy to people because they are vast and spacious, accommodating all life.

*Shuōwén* (说文): *Shén* (神) refers to Heaven’s divine force that brings forth all things.
Xu Xian (徐锴) remarked: *Shēn* (申) is the same as *yǐn* (引, to draw out).
It says that the divine force is inexhaustible, meaning it brings forth all things without limit.

The **virtue/power** overflows into reputation **[1]**, reputation overflows into violence **[2]**, scheming arises from urgency **[3]**, knowledge comes from contention **[4]**, rigidity grows from obstinacy **[5]**, and governance succeeds only when it aligns with the people’s needs **[6]**.

When spring rains fall on schedule, grasses and trees burst forth in growth, and the agricultural tools—*chí* (铫) and *nòu* (耨)—begin their use **[7]**. Yet by the time they reach full planting, half their growth is already complete, and one does not realize it **[8]**.

**[1] [Annotation]** Indeed, high reputation brings deep gain, so those who cultivate **virtue/power** exceed what is proper.
**[Annotation]** Overflow (*yì*) means excess (*shēn*).
The Five **Virtues/Powers**—*rén* (仁, benevolence) and *yì* (义, righteousness)—are practiced in excess because of the love of reputation and desire for superiority.

**[2] [Annotation]** When violence is restrained, reputation surpasses **virtue/power**.
**[Annotation]** Violence (*bào*) means harm (*cán hài*).
Reputation is the instrument of contention; when it grows excessive, harm follows inevitably. The *Inner Chapters* state: "Reputation is the cause of mutual oppression."
◎ Mr. Jia Shìfù remarked: *Shuōwén* (说文): Violence (*bào*), the same as *xī* (晞, to dry in the sun). Mencius spoke of violence to the people, and the people endured it; Xunzi’s *Rich Nation* chapter spoke of reputation sufficient to "dry in the sun" (*bào zhì*). Both illustrate the meaning of violence. **Virtue/power** overflows into reputation, meaning that **virtue/power** spreads abundantly through reputation; reputation overflows into violence, meaning that reputation spreads abundantly through the display of violence. All five sentences share the same intent. Gu Xiàng’s statement, "When violence is restrained, reputation surpasses **virtue/power**," likely contains an error.

**[3] [Annotation]** Urgency (*jié*) leads to deliberation of plans.
**[Annotation]** *Jì* (稽) means to examine (*kǎo*). *Jié* (誸) means urgency (*jí*). Plans are scrutinized only when pressed by urgency.

**[Reading Notes]** *Jié* (誸) is pronounced *xián* (贤). Gu Xiàng pronounced it *xuán* (玄), meaning urgency. Formerly written as *xián* (弦), meaning "firm and upright."

**[4] [Annotation]** When one moves in harmony, knowledge is unnecessary.
**[Annotation]** When the mind is applied to discerning knowledge beyond its scope, contention and struggle arise.

**[5] [Annotation]** *Chái* (柴) means obstruction (*sè*).
**[Annotation]** *Chái* (柴) means obstruction (*sè*). *Shǒu* (守) means to hold fast (*zhí*). When emotions are rigid and fixed, what is created does not flow smoothly.

**[Reading Notes]** *Chái* (柴) also means "accumulation" (*jī*). Gu Xiàng said: obstruction (*sè*).

**[6] [Annotation]** The people’s needs are varied, so governance is established.
**[Annotation]** When setting up officials and institutions, one must follow the people’s convenience. If one seeks against it, disaster and chaos will ensue.
◎ Yu Yì remarked: In the *Analects*, Zilu’s chapter says, "Action must be decisive" (*xíng bì guǒ*). Huang Jian’s *Commentary on the Meaning* states: "Decisive" (*guǒ*) means "accomplished" (*chéng*). Governance succeeds only when it aligns with the people’s needs, hence "governance succeeds only when it aligns with the people’s needs."

**[7] [Annotation]** All things have their causes.
**[Annotation]** *Chí* (铫) is like *sì* (耜). *Nòu* (耨) means to hoe (*chú*). In the verdant spring season, when the rains fall, all grasses and trees sprout and grow, and then the farming tools are first prepared and maintained. This illustrates acting in accordance with the seasons, not against natural inclinations.

**[Reading Notes]** *Chí* (铫) is pronounced *qiāo* (七遥反), meaning "to shave" (*xiāo*), capable of cutting through. Also pronounced *nǎo* (他尧反). *Nòu* (耨) is pronounced *nǎi dòu* (乃豆反), resembling a hoe (*chú*), a farming tool.

**[8] [Annotation]** Things arise from their natural causes, so one does not perceive it **[1]**.
**[Annotation]** Planting (*zhí*) means growth (*shēng*). When *chí* and *nòu* are used, weeds are cleared, and if one encounters favorable spring days, the hoeing is finished, and growth flourishes—all by the natural timing, not by human effort. Thus, one knows that establishing laws and teachings must follow the seasons.

**[Reading Notes]** *Dào zhí* (到植) is pronounced *shí lì* (时力反), also *zhí* (值), meaning "to stand" (*lì*). Formerly also written as *zhì* (置). Sima Qian said: "When hoeing and pulling are done, the plants grow again—this is called *dào zhí*." ◎ Lu Wénpiān remarked: *Dào* (到) is an ancient form of *dào* (倒).

**[Collation Notes]**
(1) Zhao Jiànyì’s manuscript reads *qí* (齐) instead of *jué* (觉).
(2) *Níng* (宁) can also mean "to rest" (*xiū*) in the context of *lǎo* (老, aged).
(3) *Níng* (宁) can mean "to stop" (*zhǐ*) in the context of *jù* (遽, sudden).
(4) This is the labor of the weary, not what the idle have never experienced and inquire about.

The Sage’s way of governing the world is not something the Divine Person has ever experienced and inquired about **[5]**; the Virtuous Person’s way of governing the age is not something the Sage has ever experienced and inquired about **[6]**; the Gentleman’s way of governing the state is not something the Virtuous Person has ever experienced and inquired about **[7]**; the petty man’s way of conforming to the times is not something the Gentleman has ever experienced and inquired about **[8]**.

The *Yánmén* (演门) School had a man who died from his teachings, yet they appointed a corrupt official as their teacher, and half of their followers perished from his corruption **[9]**.

Emperor Yao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You fled from it; Emperor Tang offered it to Yu Guang, but Yu Guang angrily rejected it **[10]**. Ji Tā heard of this, led his disciples, and drowned himself in the *Kuàn* (窾) River. The feudal lords mourned him, and for three years, Shen Túdí followed suit by drowning in the Yellow River **[11]**.

The fishing net exists for the sake of fish, yet when fish are caught, the net is forgotten **[12]**; the snare exists for the sake of rabbits, yet when rabbits are caught, the snare is forgotten **[13]**; words exist for the sake of meaning, yet when meaning is attained, words are forgotten **[14]**.

How then can I find one who forgets words to speak with!

For those troubled by agitation, simplicity and stillness can heal it **[1]**.

**[2] [Note]** Not that one does not grow old.

**[Citation]** *Zhì* (眦) – read as *Zhī* (子斯反) or *Zhì* (子智反), also written as *jiǎn* (揃, 子浅反). The *Cāng* (苍) says: *jiǎn* means "to trim." The *Yùpiàn* (玉篇) says: "to obscure." ◎ *Qìng Fān* notes that *Shāo Gāi*’s *Hànshū Yīnyì* cites Sima [Xian] as saying: *zhì* means "to gaze." The *Shìwén* (释文) is omitted. The *shǒu* (手) variant of *niè* (搣) is also written as *niè* (搣), pronounced *miè* (武齐反). The *Zìlín* (字林) says: "to obscure." ◎ *Lǔ Wénpiàn* says: The old text had *wèi* (未), now following the *Sòngběn* (宋本). ◎ *Jiāshì Fù* says: The *Shìwén*’s *zhì-niè* (眦搣) can restore youth; *niè* (搣) is also written as *niè* (搣). The *Guǎngyùn* (广韵) says: *niè* means "to press" or "to rub." It seems to suggest pressing the outer corners of the eyes with both hands, though this does not align with the meaning of the surrounding text. *Zhì-niè* (眦搣) likely means that when the outer corners of the eyes cannot move freely, one should close the eyes to nurture the spirit, thus restoring youth. It is also noted that *niè* (搣) and *niè* (搣) are interchangeable, and *zhì* (眦) refers to the eyes; *zhì-niè* (眦搣) means "sunken eyes."

**[3] [Note]** Not that one does not hasten.

**[Citation]** *Jù* (遽) means "rapid" or "swift."

---

When the mind is strained by urgency, tranquility can still it. **[4] [Commentary]** Even if this were so, there remains exertion, hence the recluse transcends it all. **[Explication]** To cease from haste and attain peace, to cure agitation with stillness—these are the methods of petty scholars, whose labor burdens the spirit and intelligence! How could they be the concern of those who embody the Dao, who dwell in ease and freedom, whose hearts know neither toil nor sickness? Their bearing is serene and lofty, so they never pause to inquire or respond.

**[Citation]** *Yì* (佚) is pronounced as *yì* (逸). **[5] [Commentary]** "Divine beings" refers to "Sages" (神人即圣人也); "Sage" speaks of their outward deeds, while "Divine" speaks of their inner essence. **[Explication]** *Hài* (骇) means "to alarm" (惊). The Divine are those beyond measure (不测之号); the Sage is the name given to those whose traces are manifest (显迹之名). Since their teachings move people, they do not concern themselves with trivial inquiries.

**[Citation]** *Yǐ* (以) as in *yǐ-lín* (駴) is pronounced *hù* (户楷反). Wang [X] says: It means "to alter the perception of the common people" (改百姓之视听). Xu [X] pronounces it as *jiè* (戒), meaning "to refrain from governing from above" (上不问下).

**[6] [Explication]** Those who realize Emptiness (*kōng* 空) are merely "virtuous" (贤); those who perceive the universal truth are Sages (圣). From the profound to the shallow, they do not inquire.

**[7] [Explication]** Why then do virtuous beings and gentlemen alarm the states of the feudal lords? Because the Sage abandons what is false, hence they do not inquire.

**[8] [Commentary]** Each has their own stride, each their own station—high or low. **[Explication]** Those who chase the world’s petty gains, who merely conform for a fleeting moment, like the followers of Tian Heng—such are not worthy of regard. Thus, the virtuous and the refined despise and ignore them.

**[9] [Commentary]** To covet rewards and praise while claiming filial devotion is far from the truth; this is the excess of those who advocate meritocracy. **[Explication]** [Yánmén] (演门), the Eastern Gate: Some also read it as *yínmén* (寅门), depending on the text. The filial devotion of Yanmen’s son arose from his inner heart, yet his outward conduct was exaggerated—his body wasted from self-mortification. Only when Song Jun praised his extreme filial piety did he grant him nobility and appoint him as a minister. The people of his neighborhood, hearing of his rise through filial devotion, then feigned grief and pretended self-mortification, distorting their nature and emotions. Consequently, half of those who died were from this false imitation.

**[Citation]** *Yánmén* (演门) is pronounced *shàn* (善反). It is the name of a gate in Song [state]. **[10] [Explication]** Yao recognized Shun’s virtue and passed the Mandate of Heaven (禅以九五), yet Shun declined with humility, saying, "I dare not!" and retreated to Mount Ji (箕山). Tang bestowed the Mandate upon Yu (与务光), but Yu refused, scolding and raging, and fled to the forests of Lin (籁). These acts were all in accordance with their true nature—rejecting worldly honors and glory, not feigning humility to seek fame.

**[11] [Commentary]** Thus, the swaying of public opinion harms one’s true nature, leading to such extremes. **[Explication]** [Shēn] (申) was the surname of the recluse [Tú] (徒), whose given name was Di (狄); [Jì] (纪) was the surname of the recluse [Tuó] (佗). Hearing that Tang had abdicated in favor of Yu, fearing it might apply to them, they crouched by the water with their disciples. The feudal lords, upon hearing this, valued their integrity and simplicity, often visiting to comfort them, lest they perish. Di, upon witnessing this, admired their noble reputation and plunged into the Long River (长河), drowning himself. Thus, the swaying of public opinion led them to lose their true nature.

**[Citation]** *Jì Tuó* (纪佗) is pronounced *tú hé* (徒何反). *Zhù* (踆) as in *zhù cù* (踞存) is an ancient form of *dūn* (蹲). Xu pronounces it *qī shùn* (七旬反) or *zūn* (尊). *Kǎnshuǐ* (窾水) is pronounced *kuǎnshuǐ* (款水) or *kēshuǐ* (科水). Sima [Xian] says it refers to a river’s name. [Diòu] (吊) as in *diòu zhī* (吊之): Sima [Xian] says it means "to comfort them, fearing they might drown themselves" (恐其自沈，故吊之). *Tú* (踣) is pronounced *chū fāng fù* (徐芳附反) or *pǔ dú* (普豆反). The *Zìlín* (字林) says it means "to stiffen" (僵); Li [X] says it means "to fall" (顿). Guo pronounces it *bó bēi* (薄杯反). ◎ Lu Wénpiàn (卢文弨) says: Between the two pronunciations, there should be another reading (当有又字). Not all instances like this are accounted for.

**[12] [Explication]** *Qióng* (筌) is a fish trap made of bamboo, hence the character is composed with *zhú* (竹). Some also use a grass radical, meaning *xūn* (荪) or *qióng* (荃)—a fragrant grass used to bait fish by placing it in reeds and willows within the water to attract them. *Tí* (蹄) refers to a hare, also known as *yáng* (弶) or *sì* (四), since its feet are bound, hence called *tí* (蹄). These two matters are metaphors.

**[Citation]** *Qióng* (荃) is pronounced *qī quán* (七全反); Cui pronounces it *sūn* (孙), meaning fragrant grass used to bait fish. Some say: "It is piled reeds in the water, so fish come to feed upon them." Another says: "It is a fish trap." ◎ Lu Wénpiàn (卢文弨) says: If so, it is a hidden trap. See the *Zhōu Sòng* (周颂) poems. *Tí* (蹄) is pronounced *dà xī* (大兮反), meaning "the hare’s feet" (兔□). Another says: "The hare’s *yáng* (弶), binding its feet, hence called *tí* (蹄)." □ is pronounced *gǔ xiàn* (古县反). *Yáng* (弶) is pronounced *jù liàng* (巨亮反).

**[Section 13]**
**[Commentary]** This is a metaphorical exposition. *Yì* (意) refers to subtle truth.

Now, one obtains fish and hare through the use of *qióng* (筌) and *tí* (蹄), yet *qióng* and *tí* are fundamentally distinct from fish and hare. Just as profound truth relies on language, yet language itself is not the profound truth. When fish and hare are secured, the *qióng* and *tí* are forgotten; when profound truth is illuminated, conventional speech ceases.

**[Section 14]**
**[Annotation]** As for the Two Sages, they transcend all intent and thus speak of nothing at all.

**[Commentary]** To forget speech and attain truth—this is rare indeed, for even those who witness the Dao may struggle. Hence, such difficulty arises.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Dé* (得) is pronounced *fú* (符).
**[Collation]**
(1) The text omits a misattribution, citing Zhang Junfang’s version as *Mù* (沐) instead of *Xiū* (休); the Gaoshansi edition agrees.
(2) Zhao Jianyi’s version reads *qióng* (筌), consistent below.
(3) Liu Wendi’s correction: Should read □.
(4) *Yáng* (弶) is amended per the *Shìwén*.

**Miscellaneous Discourses: Parables (27)**

**[1]**
**[Textual Notes]** The title is named by its meaning.
*Yùyán* (寓言) [19], *Chóngyán* (重言) [17], *Zhīyán* (卮言): "The sun rises, harmonized by Heaven’s *nǐ* (倪)."

**[1]**
**[Annotation]** When entrusted to others, nine out of ten statements are believed.

**[Commentary]** *Yù* (寓) means "to entrust." The common folk are deluded and prone to suspicion; when they hear teachings from oneself, they harbor doubt. But when entrusted to others, nine out of ten are believed.

Thus, figures like Hongmeng, Yunjiang, Jiānwú, and Liánshū all employ parables.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Yùyán* (寓言): *Yù* (寓) means "to entrust." Since people do not trust oneself, one borrows others’ words, and nine out of ten are believed.

**[2]**
**[Annotation]** What the world holds in esteem is believed seven times out of ten.

**[Commentary]** *Chóngyán* (重言) refers to the words of elders or respected figures in the community. Even their speech is trusted seven times out of ten.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Chóngyán* (重言): The speech of those held in esteem.
◎ My ancestor said: *Chóng* (重) should be read *zhí róng* (直容切).
*Guǎngyùn*: *Chóng* (重) means "repetition."
Zhuangzi’s text is profound—its interpretations are boundless, its allusions inexhaustible.

Guo [commentator] mistakenly reads *Chóng* (重) as *zhù yòng* (柱用切); this is incorrect.

**[3]**
**[Annotation]** The *zhī* (卮) vessel, when full, tips over; when empty, it tilts upward—it does not cling to a fixed form. Speech, too, adapts to circumstances and follows others, hence "the sun rises." *Rìchū* (日出) means "daily renewal," aligning with one’s natural disposition. When one’s nature is fully realized, harmony ensues.

**[Commentary]** *Zhī* (卮) is a wine vessel.
*Rìchū* (日出) means "daily renewal."
*Tiān nǐ* (天倪) refers to one’s natural disposition.
*Hé* (和) means "harmony."

When the *zhī* is full, it tips; when empty, it tilts. Its emptiness and fullness adapt to external forces, its tilting and rising follow others. Speech without intent is like the *zhī*—thus, it does not cling to fixed forms, aligning with natural disposition.

Alternative interpretation: *Zhī* (卮) means "fragmented." Speech that is disjointed and lacks coherence is called *zhīyán* (卮言).

**[Textual Notes]**
*Zhīyán* (卮言) is also written *zhīyán* (卮言), pronounced *zhī* (支).
*Shìwén* notes: *Zhī* (卮) is a round wine vessel, pronounced *Lǐ qǐ yì* (李起宜反).
Wang [commentator] says:
The *zhī* vessel, when full, tips; when empty, it tilts—it adapts to circumstances, not clinging to a single form. Applied to speech, it follows others and varies, without fixed allegiance.

Sima [commentator] says: It refers to disjointed speech lacking coherence.
◎ Lu Wénpiàn notes: *Zhī* (卮) was originally written *zhī* (卮). According to *Shuōwén*, it was written □, with □ below; now often abbreviated as *zhī* (卮). If written as *zhī* (卮), there would be no need to note "also written as."

*Tiān nǐ* (天倪) is pronounced *yí* (宜), Xu [commentator] reads *yì* (诣).

*Yùyán shíjiǔ* (寓言十九): Borrowed from external discourse [1].
A father does not act as a matchmaker for his own son.
A father’s praise of his son is less trusted than that of someone unrelated [2];
"It is not my fault, but the fault of others" [3];
If it aligns with oneself, one affirms it; if it does not, one rejects it [4];
What aligns with oneself is deemed correct; what differs is deemed wrong [5].

**[1]**
**[Annotation]** Teachings originating from oneself are often distrusted by the common folk, hence the reliance on external voices. Figures like Jiānwú and Liánshū all employ such borrowed discourse.

**[Commentary]** *Jiè* (藉) means "to borrow," thus entrusting [it to others]. Nine out of ten statements are believed when attributed to others.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Jiè* (藉): Guo [commentator] says "to borrow"; Li [commentator] says "to rely on."

**[2]**
**[Annotation]** Though a father’s praise of his son may sometimes be believed, suspicion often arises due to inherent bias, hence the need for external validation.

**[Commentary]** *Méi* (媒) means "to mediate." When a father speaks of his son, few believe him; but when another praises him, many do.

**[Textual Notes]**
*Yù zhī* (誉之) is pronounced *yú* (余). Annotation matches above.

**[3]**
**[Annotation]** Even if one is personally convinced, those harboring habitual doubt still refuse to accept it. When entrusted to another, they believe—such is the burden of human perception.

**[Commentary]** *Wú* (吾) refers to the father. Though the father’s words about his son may be truthful, listeners unjustly suspect bias, leading to disbelief.

**[4]**
**[Annotation]** Mutual contradiction arises.

**[Commentary]** The common folk are perverse, arbitrarily deeming things good or bad. If it aligns with their own views, they affirm it; if it differs, they reject it.

**[5]**
**[Annotation]** In three cases of agreement and disagreement, two instances of disagreement lead to legal disputes over what is taken, proving that those who do not dispute must also disagree, yet only trust what aligns with their own views—external validation cannot resolve this.

---

「**[Commentary]** Those who are deluded and cling to distinctions between likeness and difference, arbitrarily perceiving what is right or wrong—once these distinctions are shown to be empty, right and wrong are extinguished as well.

**[Annotation]** The *Shìdé Táng* edition reads “borrowed from below” (借下) instead of “without” (无者).

**[17]** This repetition of ten out of seven is meant to reinforce what has already been spoken, thus establishing the *qí’ài*—**[1]** the venerable elders. **[Commentary]** Their age alone makes the common folk hold them in such high regard that even if their words are not externally validated, they are still believed seven times out of ten.

**[Commentary]** *Qí’ài* refers to those of advanced years and long experience. Having already spoken, they do not rely on external support, but as they are the aged, they are revered and trusted. The vulgar masses fall into such delusion and credulity.

**[Reading Text]** The character *ài* (艾) in “耆艾” is reversed in five instances.

**[2]** **[Annotation]** Age comes before all else in things, but if one lacks the principles of origin and conclusion to guide others, then this is not what should come first. *Qī* (期) means to await.

**[Commentary]** *Qī* (期) means to await. The vertical threads are called *jīng* (经), and the horizontal connections are called *wéi* (纬). This person merely relies on his advanced age to take precedence, yet he lacks the wisdom of fundamental principles. Thus, he is accorded the respect due to the venerable, but this has nothing to do with moral virtue being the proper basis for precedence.

**[Annotation]** The *Jiāshì Fù* says: “Already spoken” refers to words spoken beforehand and then repeated. The *Ěryǎ* explains *guì* (诂): *qí’ài* means “long” (长); *ài* means “experienced” (历). *Guō Pú*’s annotation states: “The aged often have much experience.” The *Shìmíng* says: “Sixty years old is called *qí* (耆); *qí* means ‘to point out’ (指), to point to matters and instruct others.” This is the meaning of *qí’ài* in taking precedence over others. The principles of *jīng* (经), *wéi* (纬), and *běnmò* (本末) are what should precede others, and people also await these qualities. Repeating words without weariness, exhorting and warning—through this, the *rén dào* (human Dao) **[Commentary]** may be preserved.

**[3]** **[Annotation]** This is merely a person of long-standing, yet the common folk blindly trust him; this is how the vulgar cling to the familiar and adhere to custom.

**[Commentary]** Without ritual propriety or moral conduct to take precedence over others, there is no human Dao. This is simply a person of long-standing, so he is revered—but the vulgar masses are so unknowing that they reach this point.

**[Annotation]** The *Gāoshān Sì* edition reads *láiqí* (来耆) instead of *niánqí* (年耆).

**[1]** The *zhī* (卮) speaks of the sun’s rising, harmonizing with the *tiān nǐ* (天倪)—**[Commentary]** following its natural course—**[Annotation]** thus extending through the year **[1]**. If one does not speak, it is uniform; **[2]** if speech is not uniform with silence, **[3]** and if silence is not uniform with speech, **[4]** then it is said **[Annotation]** **[1]**—there is no speech. **[5]** Speech without speech, **[6]** speaking throughout one’s life without ever failing to speak; **[7]** a lifetime of silence without ever truly ceasing to speak.

**[8]** There are things that can be done by oneself and things that cannot; **[9]** there are things that are so by themselves and things that are not so by themselves. **[10]**」

**[8]** How does it come to be so? It comes to be so by itself. How does it come to be otherwise? It comes to be otherwise by itself. How does it come to be possible? It comes to be possible by itself. How does it come to be impossible? It comes to be impossible by itself. **[9]** Things naturally have what is so, and things naturally have what is possible **[Annotation]** **[10]**, but there is no thing that is otherwise, and no thing that is impossible **[Annotation]** **[11]**. If not the *zhī* (卮) speaking of the sun’s rising, harmonizing with the *tiān nǐ* (天倪), who could attain its enduring course **[Annotation]** **[12]**! All things are seeds, their differing forms transforming through *shàn* (禅) **[Annotation]** **[13]**, beginning and ending like a cycle **[Annotation]** **[14]**, none surpassing in rank **[Annotation]** **[15]**, thus called *tiān jūn* (天均) **[Annotation]** **[16]**. *Tiān jūn* (天均) is the *tiān nǐ* (天倪).

**[Commentary]** **[1]** The *Way* (道) of Nature has no inherent right or wrong; without a master, it unfolds naturally. Who could fix it? Thus, it is vast and unrestrained, and one follows it accordingly—so each attains its natural lifespan.

**[Explanation]** *Shàn* (曼衍) means without intent. Following the daily renewal of change and aligning with the natural divisions of *tiān nǐ* (天倪), one can thus follow all things without attachment, responding to them without deliberation. Hence, they fulfill the *Way*’s natural course and reach the utmost longevity.

**[Note]** The *shàn* (曼衍) chapter reads *shàn* (曼) with the *zhàn* (战) radical.

**[Explanation]** **[2]** The principle is beyond speech; speech would distort it. Thus, it is simply stated that without speech, things naturally balance themselves.

**[Annotation]** The *Master’s Ancestral Lineage* says: "Not speaking is uniformity—like the *zhī* (卮) speaking of the sun’s rising, extending through the year, yet still remaining without speech. The *zhī*’s speech follows speech, yet also follows non-speech. There is speech yet truly no speech, and there is no speech yet truly not no speech—this is the *tiān nǐ* (天倪).

**[Explanation]** **[3]** Uniformity (*qí* 齐) is non-speech. Since non-speech and speech are not one, they are not uniform.

**[Note]** **[4]** If one entrusts it to things and employs speech accordingly, then the opposites of right and wrong naturally align. If one cannot adjust speech based on things to achieve uniformity, then one’s self and all things will again fail to align.

**[Note]** The *fù* (复) chapter reads *fù* (扶) with the *yòu* (又) radical. The same below.

**[Note]** **[5]** Speech is only the speech of others. Thus, though there is speech, I truly do not speak.

**[Explanation]** **[6]** Though words issue from my mouth, they are only the speech of others. This further clarifies the meaning of "speech without speech."

**[Note]** **[7]** It is only the speech of others issuing from my mouth.

**[Explanation]** This again elucidates the meaning of "speech without speech."

**[Explanation]** **[8]** Each holds their own perspective, so there is what is possible and what is so. But since self and other are empty, what is so and possible vanishes.

**[Note]** **[9]** Self (*zì* 自) means "from." From the partiality of self and other, there arises what is possible and impossible.

**[Explanation]** *Èhū* (恶乎) is the same as *yúhū* (于何). Since self and other are both empty and things and self are all illusory, how can there be what is possible and impossible? How can there be what is so and otherwise? By this reasoning, what is so and possible naturally ceases. This again clarifies the meaning of "there are things that are so by themselves and things that are not so by themselves."

**[Note]** The *èhū* (恶乎) chapter reads *wū* (乌). The same below.

**[Note]** **[10]** Each follows its natural course; each is naturally possible.

**[Note]** **[11]** In general, there is neither possibility nor impossibility, and they both reach their natural state.

**[Explanation]** **[12]** Common things and those who invert truth naturally hold that what is impossible is possible and what is not so is so.

**[Note]** **[13]** Though forms change and succeed one another, their *qi* (气) is fundamentally one.

**[Explanation]** *Shàn* (禅) means "to succeed." These things, as they appear, arise from the *Way*’s creation, receiving the same *qi* (气) yet differing in form and substance, circulating and transforming endlessly.

**[Note]** The *jiē zhǒng* (皆种) chapter reads *yǒng* (勇) with the *zhāng* (章) radical.

**[Note]** **[14]** What is now beginning was already ended yesterday.

**[Explanation]** The transformation of things is like a cycle—death gives way to life, and the end returns to the beginning. This describes the state of *shàn* (禅) and transformation.

**[Note]** **[15]** Principle is inherently so; thus, none surpass.

**[Explanation]** *Lún* (伦) is principle. Seeking the *Way* of change, one finds no principle to be attained.

**[Note]** **[16]** Is *jūn* (均) and *qí* (齐) arbitrary? They are the natural divisions of *tiān* (天).

**[Explanation]** *Jūn* (均) is the same as *qí* (齐). This summarizes the previous chapter’s meaning, stating that the *Way*’s natural balance and uniformity is also called the natural divisions of *tiān* (天).

**[Annotation]** The *Master’s Ancestral Lineage* says: "The arising of speech is like the transformation of all things. All things have seeds, growing endlessly yet unable to fix one form as their transformation. Speech has seeds, extending infinitely yet unable to fix one word as its beginning. Beginning and end have no clear trace—this is called *tiān jūn* (天均)."

**[Correction]** **(1)** The *Gāoshān Sì* (高山寺) edition adds a "speech" character below. **(2)** The "while" (*ér* 而) character is supplemented from the sentence above.

*Zhuāngzǐ* said to *Huìzǐ*: "At sixty years of age, Confucius had undergone sixty transformations **[1]**. What he initially affirmed, he ultimately denied **[2]**, yet we do not know whether the fifty-nine denials were indeed denials **[3]**.

「" **[1]** **[Annotation]** In harmony with the times **[1]**. **[Exegesis]** The ceaseless flux of all things never stops, with each new phase flowing and fading away—thus it is that at sixty years of age, Confucius underwent changes in step with the times **[2]**. Though Zhuangzi and Huizi met, they favored discussing the **Dao/Way** of the Mysterious, so Zhuangzi spoke of Confucius at a distance to illustrate the nature of transformation **[3]**.

**[2]** **[Annotation]** When the times change, the common sentiments also change; those who ride the currents of things to wander with their hearts—how could they differ from the common? **[4]**

**[3]** **[Annotation]** Change is ceaseless, and thus it cannot be constant. **[Exegesis]** For human lifespan is measured by years, and since years are not fixed, how could the count be constant? Therefore, what was affirmed last year is now denied. Hence, what is affirmed this year may still be the denial of last year; what is denied this year may become the affirmation of next year. Thus, the **Róngchéng Shì** (容成氏) said: *"There are no fixed years—only the passing of days."* **[Annotation]** The *Zhào Jiànyì* (赵谏议) edition also uses *huà* (化) **[5]**.

Huizi said: *"Confucius was diligent in his resolve and applied his knowledge **[1]**.*
**[1]** **[Annotation]** This means Confucius applied his resolve and embraced knowledge through effort, not by allowing himself to transform naturally. This reveals that Huizi’s understanding of the **Dao/Way** did not extend as far as that of the Sage **[2]**. **[Exegesis]** *Service* (服) here means *application*. Hui Shi had not yet attained full comprehension; he merely assessed Confucius, saying that through striving in resolve and diligent practice, Confucius applied his heart to learning the **Dao/Way**, thus attaining such wisdom—not by naturally yielding to transformation. **[3]**

Zhuangzi said: *"Confucius acknowledged this **[1]**, yet he never spoke of it **[2]**. Confucius said: *'One receives talent from the great root, and vitality returns to give life **[3]*.'* When one sounds, it accords with the **law/measure** (律); when one speaks, it accords with the **Dao/Way** **[4]**. Benefit and righteousness are laid out before him, yet his likes and dislikes, his judgments of right and wrong, merely follow the words of others **[5]**. When people truly follow in heart, they dare not stand alone in opposition, and thus he settles the **Dao/Way** of the world **[6]**. Oh, oh! I am far from attaining this **[7]!**"* **[1]** **[Annotation]** He acknowledged that transformation arises naturally, not through the exertion of knowledge, so he followed the times and yielded to things without fabricating speech **[2]**. **[Exegesis]** *Acknowledged* (谢) here means *to accept as given*. *While* (而) refers to *you* (汝), and *never* (未) means *not* **[3]**.

「“The Master [Confucius]’s mind of diligent service has long since accepted transformation as natural **[1]**. You should now awaken to your innate essence and cease idle speech **[2]**. If one forces their innate talents and knowledge while failing to restore their original essence, then life and death are but a fleeting breath **[3]**. Indeed, all beings receive their talents and wisdom from the **Dao/Way**’s wondrous source, and they fulfill their existence through the vitality of their spirit—how could they strain their minds in laborious effort and defy the **Creator/Workings of Nature** (造物)!

This is **Zhuangzi** recounting **Kong Qiu**’s words to reproach **Hui Shi** **[4]**.

**[5]**. The sound [of the lute] arises from the **law/measure** (律); words come from the **Dao/Way** **[5]**. Yet the **law/measure** and **Dao/Way** are the works of the multitude, and sages merely employ them—so nothing fails to accord, yet he never spoke of them or acted upon them **[6]**. The Master [Confucius], a sage, harmonized with **Yin-Yang** (阴阳) in his **virtue/power** (德), so his music’s rhythms aligned with the **lute’s tuning** (锺律), and his teachings were measured against the **standards of conduct** (模范) **[7]**.

**[8]**. *Service* (服) here means *employment* (用). I have no words of my own; my speech merely employs the words of others. The exposition of likes and dislikes, right and wrong, benefit and righteousness—these were never my own utterance, but simply what preceded me **[9]*. When I speak, I follow the **dharma** of others, adapting my discourse to their inclinations—yet this is still the employment of others’ words **[10]**. Thus, I make no claim to originality, but merely echo what others have said, and my words accord with the **Dao/Way** of the world **[11]**.

**[12]**. Oh, oh! I am far from attaining this **[12]!**

**[13]**. The words of **Hui Shi** were shallow and vain, unable to grasp even this **[13]**. For when one rides the current of things, they need not struggle against it—like grass bending with the wind, they dare not stand in opposition. Following their natural disposition, they settle into their **Dao/Way**’s inherent stillness, so they establish the **Dao/Way** of the world **[14]**.

**[15]**. **Zengzi**, twice in service, twice transformed in heart **[15]**, said: *“When I served to support my parents, even three *dou* of grain **[16]** made my heart content; later, in service after their death, even three thousand *dou* did not bring fulfillment, and my heart was sorrowful **[17]**.”* **[18]**. The meaning of *twice in service* (再仕) appears in the following passage **[19]**. **Zengzi**, surnamed **Zeng** and named **Shen**, was a disciple of **Confucius** **[20]**. The sorrow and joy that shifted his heart were because, when his parents were alive, even modest wealth brought gladness; but after their passing, abundant wealth could not assuage his grief—this was the so-called *twice transformed*, for he could not reach the fulfillment of honoring his parents **[21]**.

**[22]**. *[Annotation]* Three *dou* **[23]** is six *shu* and four *dou* **[24]**. *[Annotation]* *Heart’s content* (心乐) is pronounced *heart’s Lo* (洛) **[25]**. The following note is the same **[26]**. *[Annotation]* Six *hu* and four *dou* is called *trong* (锺) **[27]**. The following note is the same **[28]**. *Content* (洎) means *to reach* **[29]**. **Zengzi**, most filial, sought wealth only to nourish his parents—thus, when he served while they lived, even little wealth brought joy; but after their death, though wealth was plentiful, his heart was heavy with sorrow **[30]**. This was the *twice transformed*, for his joy and sorrow shifted with the absence or presence of his parents **[31]**.」

The *Sutra of "Not Reaching"*—its vessel inverted **[1]**.

**[Annotation]** *[Collation]* The *Shide Hall* edition omits the *wu* character.

A disciple asked Master Kong: *"Can one like Zengzi be said to bear no blame for his actions? **[1]"***

**[1]** **[Annotation]** *Xuan* (县), to bind **[2]**.
It is said that Zengzi sought office to provide for his parents—thus, though bound by wealth, he bore no blame.

**[Commentary]** *Xuan* (县), to bind. Among the disciples, there was no surname *Di*, so this must be from the ranks of the Four Classes or Ten Virtuous Ones. Zengzi, virtuous and filial, sought office to nourish his parents. Though his joy and sorrow shifted, he should bear no blame for seeking wealth. The disciples, doubting this, consulted Master Kong.

**[Annotations]** *Zeng* (参) reads *suǒjīn* **[3]**. *Wúsuǒxuàn* (无所县) pronounced *wúsuǒxuān* **[4]**. The following is the same. *Qízuìhū* (其罪乎)—*xuàn* (县), to bind. Though his heart twice transformed over wealth, his concern was for his parents. Though bound by wealth, he bore no blame. *Yǐwéi* (以为) reads *yúwéi* **[5]**.

Master Kong replied: *"He has already been bound **[1]**. One who bears no binding—can he truly feel sorrow? **[2]** To him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* are like watching sparrows, gnats, and horseflies pass before his eyes **[3]**. "

**[1]** **[Annotation]** Bound by wealth to provide.

The disciples, still in doubt, consulted Master Kong.

**[Annotations]** *Yǐyǎng* (以养) pronounced *yángshàng* **[1]**. The following is the same.

Master Kong said: *"One who nourishes his parents appropriately need not concern himself with wealth. If one can be unbound **[2]**, then he neither weighs noble or base in his heart, but remains serene and joyful, fully fulfilling what is fitting in filial care. **[3]**

**[2]** **[Commentary]** The filial son serves his parents, striving only for harmony—wealth’s abundance or scarcity matters not. He exhausts himself in care alone, hence even a laborer may be called filial, while three promotions may still be deemed unfilial. Zeng, though his heart held sorrow and joy, did he not bear the binding of wealth as guilt? Only the unbound can truly know no sorrow or joy. **[4]**

**[3]** **[Commentary]** *Bǐ* (彼), referring to the unbound. The unbound regard honor and wealth as fleeting as gnats, horseflies, and birds before their eyes—how could sorrow or joy arise within them? **[5]**

**[4]** **[Commentary]** *Bǐ* (彼), the unbound man. The crane is large, likening it to three thousand *zhong*; the gnat and horsefly are small, comparing them to three *fu*. The enlightened one, unbound by wealth, perceives three thousand *zhong* and three *fu* without distinction—like birds and insects passing before his eyes, gone in an instant. How could they bind him? **[6]**

**[Annotations]** *Rú guàn* (如鹳) originally read *guàn* (观). *Wén* (文) pronunciation for *wén* (蚊). *Chóng* (虻) pronounced *mènggēng*. Sima (司马) says: *"To observe sparrows flying swiftly, like gnats passing—suddenly, one takes no notice."* Wang (王) says: *"The crane and gnat contrast in size, illustrating the vastness of three thousand *zhong* and the meagerness of three *fu*."* The *Yuanjia* edition reads *rú guànwén* (如鹳蚊), omitting *chóng* (虻). **[7]**

Yu Yu (俞樾) says: *"The word *què* (雀) is a later interpolation. The *Yuanjia* edition omits *chóng* (虻), suggesting the original text lacked both *què* and *chóng*. The crane and gnat are ill-matched in metaphor—Wang’s explanation of size contrast is plausible, but the sage’s perception transcends such distinctions. Likely, the original read: *‘As he watches three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* pass, like observing gnats and horseflies before him.’* The *Huainanzi* (*Túzhēn* chapter) compares defamation to a fleeting gnat—its meaning aligns. The corruption likely began with *guàn* (观) mistakenly written as *guàn* (鹳), leading to later harmonizations: the *Yuanjia* edition omits *chóng* (虻), while the current text adds *què* (雀). Neither reflects the original *Zhuangzi*." **[8]**

**[Collation]** (1) Zhao Jianyi’s edition reads *guàn* (鹳) instead of *guàn* (观). The missing text, citing Zhang Junfang’s edition, reads: *"Guàn què (鹳雀) as guàn niǎo què (观鸟雀)."* **[9]**

Preyan Child You (颜成子游) said to Dongguo Ziqin (东郭子綦):

*"Since I first heard your words,
**One year** and I became wild **[1]**, **[2]**
**Two years** and I followed **[3]**, **[4]**
**Three years** and I was harmonized **[5]**, **[6]**
**Four years** and I became one with things **[7]**, **[8]**
**Five years** and I returned **[9]**, **[10]**
**Six years** and ghosts entered **[11]**, **[12]**
**Seven years** and Heaven was complete **[13]**, **[14]**
**Eight years** and I knew neither death nor life **[15]**, **[16]**
**Nine years** and I attained Great Mystery **[17]." **[18]**

**[1]** **[Commentary]** Detached from worldly gain. **[19]**
**[2]** **[Explanation]** Dwelling east of the city walls, he was called Dongguo—just as in the *Qíwùpiān* (齐物篇), Southguo Ziqin (南郭子綦). Child You was Ziqin’s disciple. *Wild* means unadorned simplicity. Hearing the Dao in one year, his learning was still raw, yet he began to shed artificiality. **[20]**

**[Annotations]** *Zǐqí* (子綦) pronounced *qí*. **[21]**

**[3]** **[Commentary]** No longer self-possessed. **[22]**
**[4]** **[Explanation]** Aligned with convention. **[23]**

**[5]** **[Commentary]** Unified with self and others. **[24]**
**[6]** **[Explanation]** Unentangled by boundaries. **[25]**

**[7]** **[Commentary]** In harmony with all things. **[26]**
**[8]** **[Explanation]** In harmony with all things. **[27]**

**[9]** **[Commentary]** Self-fulfilled. **[28]**
**[10]** **[Explanation]** Returned to the masses. **[29]**

**[11]** **[Commentary]** Transcended bodily form. **[30]**
**[12]** **[Explanation]** The spirit merges with principle and things. **[31]**

**[13]** **[Commentary]** No further striving. **[32]**
**[14]** **[Explanation]** Naturally complete. **[33]**

**[Annotations]** *Suǒfù* (所复) pronounced *fúyòu*. **[34]**

**[15]** **[Commentary]** All encounters bring ease and rest. **[35]**
**[16]** **[Explanation]** Wisdom fathoms creation, the spirit aligns with nature—thus unaware of life, death, gathering, or scattering. **[36]**

**[17]** **[Commentary]** *Miao* (妙), excellence. Good and evil are one. Thus, nowhere does he fail to penetrate. This speaks of prolonged Dao-hearing, where worldly stains dissolve utterly. **[37]**
**[18]** **[Explanation]** *Miao* (妙), profound subtlety. With time, learning deepens, surpassing the Four Sentences, severing a hundred faults. His understanding reaches the utmost mystery, encompassing all wonders—thus called *Great*. **[38]**

**[Annotations]** *Tiānlài* (天籁) pronounced *lìdài*. **[39]**

---
Life is artificial; death is natural **[1]**.
I urge the public: though death is natural,
yet life is contrived **[2]**.
And yet—how can this be so?
Where does it find its place?
Where does it not find its place?
Heaven has its cycles; Earth has its occupants.
Where then shall I seek it? **[40]**
Its end is unknown—how then can it lack *ming* (命)? **[41]**

「How can it be said to have *ming* (命) when its beginning is unknown? **[8]**
If there is something to correspond with it, how can it lack *guǐxié* (ghostly evils)? **[9]**
If there is nothing to correspond with it, how can it have *guǐxié* (ghostly evils)? **[10]**

**[1]** **[Annotation]** If life is contrived, it loses its *shēng* (生). **[11]**
**[Exposition]** In the Dao of humans, those immersed in contrivance inevitably return to the path of death and annihilation. **[12]**
**[Pronunciation Note]** *Shēng* (丧) pronounced *xīlàng*. **[13]**

**[2]** **[Annotation]** *Zì* (自), by also. By contrivance, there is death; by clinging to life, there is contrivance. Now, I urge the public because death arises from clinging to life.
**[Exposition]** The public, that is, the common folk. *Zì* (自), by also. What moves people to the brink of death is their private love for life, unable to remain impartial and just. Thus, I exhort them. **[14]**

**[3]** **[Annotation]** Yet life, as the *yáng* (阳) force, abruptly ceases without trace or effort—this is not by any means.
**[Exposition]** Life arises from the *yáng* (阳) qi, yet it comes without origin. Thus, it is not worth clinging to. **[15]**

**[4]** **[Exposition]** *Guǒ* (果), decidedly. The *yáng* (阳) qi gives rise to life—this is decidedly so. **[16]**

**[5]** **[Annotation]** And yet, decidedly so, hence neither finding its place nor not finding its place, and only then is it everywhere fitting.
**[Exposition]** The gathering of qi is life, yet life is not worth delighting in; the scattering of qi is death, yet death is not worth grieving over. If life and death are equal, then sorrow and joy dissolve. Thus, where can one find a fitting place, and where cannot one find a fitting place? It is fitting everywhere. **[17]**
**[Pronunciation Note]** *Wùhū* (恶乎) pronounced *wū*. Same below. **[18]**

**[6]** **[Annotation]** All is already self-sufficient. **[19]**

**[Exposition]**
The stars and their courses, the mysterious patterns arrayed in heaven—
the Nine Regions and Four Quarters, where all beings take their stand.
Within the workings of creation, all is already complete.
Where then must I seek beyond what is already present? **[20]**
**[Pronunciation Note]** *Tian yǒu lì* (天有历) is also written as *tian yǒu lìshù* (天有历数).

**[7] [Annotation]**
The principle must reach its own conclusion; it does not depend on knowledge.
If not by fate, then how?

**[Exposition]**
The rising and setting of heaven and earth, the birth and death of all beings—
trace their origins, and none know their beginning or end.
Fortune comes and fortune goes; if not by fate, then how?
Those who say there is no fate are in truth speaking of fate.

**[8] [Annotation]**
To know not *why* yet accept *that it is so*—this is called fate.
It seems as though there is intent, so the name of fate is discarded
to reveal its self-so nature, and only then is the principle of fate complete.

**[Exposition]**
Death gives way to life, just as spring follows winter and summer follows autumn—
without beginning or end, how could this be fate?
Those who say there is fate are in truth speaking of no fate.
This is again discarding the notion of fate.

**[9] [Annotation]**
The principle must have correspondence, as if some divine agency brings it about.

**[Exposition]**
Ghosts are the lingering *shénzhì* (神识, numinous awareness).
The ears and eyes respond to sound and color;
the mind responds to the world—just as echoes follow their cause,
how could there be no numinous presence?
Those who say there are no ghosts are in truth affirming their existence.

**[10] [Annotation]**
The principle corresponds of its own accord, not due to any external cause—
thus, though there is correspondence, there is no numinous agency.

**[Exposition]**
When a person sleeps, they are unaware of the external world,
though eyes and ears remain—yet they do not respond to color or sound.
If there were a numinous presence, how could they not respond?
Those who say there are ghosts are in truth denying their existence.
This is again discarding the notion of ghosts.

**[Collation Note]**
(1) The text is missing and incorrectly cites Zhang Junfang’s version, which includes the character *sī* (私) below.
The *Wángwàngliǎng* (罔罔两) asks the *Jǐng* (景):
“Why is it that you were once bowed and now stand upright,
that you once bound your hair and now let it loose,
that you once sat and now stand,
that you once walked and now stand still? **[1]**

**[1] [Exposition]**
*Wángwàngliǎng* (罔罔两) is the shadowy *wēiyīn* (微阴, subtle negative force) beyond form.
This is an allegory. *Rú* (若), “you.”
*Fǔ* (俯), to lower one’s head.
*Zhuō* (撮), to bind one’s hair.
Your sitting, rising, walking, and stopping—
your form alone moves as it must.
By measuring this, one sees that form is the sole basis.
It is said that this does not await [external cause],
yet the principle remains unclear.
This question-and-answer is set forth to illuminate *dúhuà* (独化, self-transforming singularity).”

**[Exposition]**
*Jǐng* (景): pronounced as *yǐng* (影), also read as the character itself.
Originally, it may have been written as *yǐng* (影).
◎ **Lu Wénbiàn** (卢文弨) remarks: The character *yǐng* (影) is attributed to Tao Hongjing’s authorship and is not an ancient form.

*Yě kuò* (也括): pronounced *guō* (活反).
Sima [Qian] explains: It means to bind one’s hair.

*Bèifà* (被发): pronounced *jǐ* (皮寄反).

**[Collation]**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s copy reads *yǐng* (影) for *jǐng* (景), and this is consistent below.
(2) The character *zhuō* (撮) is restored based on Cheng’s commentary and the lacuna-filled citation of Zhang Junfang’s text.

*Jǐng* (景) says:
“Why do you ask further of this *sōusōu* (搜搜) **[1]**
when the movement is of its own accord? **[1]**

I possess what I do not know its source. **[2]**
I am like the cicada’s shed shell, the serpent’s cast skin—
resembling them yet not them. **[3]**

Fire and the sun are my *tún* (屯, stagnation/accumulation);
darkness and night are my *dài* (代, substitution). **[4]**
Is it they that I await? **[5]**
How much more so those who await what is *wú* (無, non-existent)! **[6]**

When they come, I come with them;
when they depart, I depart with them.
When they are strong *yáng* (陽), I am strong *yáng* with them.
What need is there for questioning this strong *yáng*? **[7]”**

**[1] [Annotation]**
Movement occurs naturally; there is no need for further inquiry.

**[Commentary]**
*Sōusōu* (叟叟) is the appearance of motion without intent.
*Deliberate* (奚) means "why."
*Jǐng* replies:
"My motion is without intent, serene and self-sufficient—
I await nothing, spontaneously transforming.
You know nothing; why trouble yourself with questions?"

**[Explanation of Text]**
*Sōusōu* (搜搜) is also written as *sǒu* (叟), same meaning.
*Sōu* (叟) is pronounced *sùkǒu* (素口反), also *sùdāo* (素刀反), or like *xiāo* (萧).
Previously noted: a depiction of motion.

**[2] [Annotation]**
It occurs naturally, so I do not know its source.

**[Commentary]**
*Yú* (予) is "I."
All my actions and stillness follow the natural order—
I know no source, cannot explain their nature.
How could there be anything to await?

**[3] [Annotation]**
A shadow resembles form but is not form itself.

**[Commentary]**
*Tiáojiǎ* (蜩甲) is the cicada’s shed shell.
*Shétuì* (蛇蜕) is the serpent’s cast skin.
The grub transforms into a cicada, the serpent sheds its skin—
neither knows its own change.
The grub perishes before the cicada emerges;
the cicada does not arise *because* of the grub.
The serpent’s skin follows the same principle.
Thus, all things exist without mutual dependence,
each spontaneously arising—all called *zìrán* (自然, "self-so").
Hence, I say: My dependence is like the cicada’s shell and serpent’s skin—
it seems to have form but is not truly dependent on form.

**[Explanation of Text]**
*Tiáojiǎ* (蜩甲) is pronounced *tiáojiá* (条).
Sima Qian says: *Tiáojiǎ* is the cicada’s shed skin.
*Shétuì* (蛇蜕) is pronounced *shuì* (帨), also *tǔwò* (吐卧反), or *shǐruì* (始锐反).

**[4] [Commentary]**
*Tún* (屯) means "accumulation."
*Dài* (代) means "replacement."

The presence of fire and sun, my shadow accumulates;
when night falls or clouds obscure, my shadow fades and rests.
If my shadow depended on form alone,
then it would not require fire or sun.
Yet darkness and night possess form without shadow—
thus it is known that my shadow does not depend on form,
and the principle of spontaneous transformation is made clear.

**[Explanation of Text]**
*Wú tún* (吾屯) is pronounced *túmén* (徒门), meaning "accumulation."
◎Regency Fan annotates from the *Wénxuǎn* commentary on Xie Lingyun’s *Gaming the Southern Pavilion* poem: Sima Qian says:
*Tún* (屯), "accumulation"—when fire and sun shine, shadows appear, hence "my accumulation."
*Dài* (代), "replacement"—when darkness comes, shadows vanish, hence "my replacement."
*Yè dài* (夜代) means "night’s replacement," i.e., allowing rest.

**[5] [Commentary]**
My reason for dependence is fire and sun.
If they lack substance, fire and sun cannot produce shadow,
so shadows do not depend on fire and sun either.

**[6] [Note]**
Pursuing this to its extreme:
Even what is said to be dependent
ultimately reaches the point of no dependence,
and the principle of spontaneous transformation is manifest.

**[Commentary]**
What more is there to say of dependence?
If there is no fire or sun, form cannot produce shadow—
it does not depend on form.
Form arises without fire or sun,
and shadows arise—
how could they depend on form?
Thus, by comparing fire and sun to form,
it is clear that shadows do not depend on form.
Form and shadow do not rely on each other—
how much more so for other things!
Hence, all dharmas
are known to arise spontaneously.

◎My father of the family said:
When fire and sun appear, shadows arise;
when night falls, shadows retreat.
*Tún* (屯) refers to the initial growth of grass and trees;
*Dài* (代) means "change" or "replacement"—
when form changes, my shadow rests accordingly.
Shadows follow form, each mirroring the person’s likeness,
yet they are insubstantial, yielding to form’s every shift.
This is the grand essence of Zhuangzi’s *Responding to the World*.

**[7] [Note]**
They simply follow the strong vitality of movement,
coming and going in attendance—
without intent, beyond questioning.

**[Commentary]**
Form is what moves.
Strong vitality is the appearance of movement.
When shadows move in tandem with form,
they share the same time—
without dependence, all arise from spontaneous transformation.
The principle of spontaneous transformation transcends all names and speech;
names and speech are merely its outward expression.

*Surname* Yang, *given name* Zhu, styled Zǐjū (子居).
*"Zhī"* (之) in *"zhī Pei"* (之沛) is pronounced *bèi* (贝).
*"Yāo"* (邀) rhymes with *"yáo"* (古尧反), meaning "to seek," "to encounter," or "to intercept."
The *Yùpiàn* (玉篇) states: "to seek," "to gather," or "to obstruct."

**[2] [Commentary]**
Earlier, when I met Yang Zhu, I thought he had a mind for the Dao.
Now, seeing his arrogance, I know he is difficult to teach.
Disliking his unconventional ways, I sigh in disappointment.
Yang Zhu did not respond.

Upon arriving at his dwelling,
he offered water for washing and rinsing,
presented a towel and comb,
removed his shoes outside the door,
and knelt forward to say:

"Earlier, your disciple wished to invite you, Master,
but your journey was not convenient,
so I dared not.
Now that you are at ease,
I humbly request to inquire about my faults."

**[1] [Commentary]**
He felt ashamed of his own shortcomings and remained silent in reverence.

**[2] [Commentary]**
*Swashing* (盥) means to wash or rinse.
*Comb* (栉) means to comb.
Upon arriving at the lodging,
he proceeded to the place of rest,
offered water for rinsing and washing,
held the towel and comb,
moved forward with elbows and knees—
conducting himself with utmost respect and earnestness,
hoping to receive instruction and correction.

**[Release Notes]**
*"Swashing"* (盥) is pronounced *guàn* (管).
The *Xiǎo Éryá* (小尔雅) defines it as "to bathe" or "to rinse."
*"Rinsing"* (漱) is pronounced *shù* (所又反).
*"Towel and comb"* (巾栉) rhymes with *"zhāng yǐ"* (庄乙反).

**[3] [Commentary]**
Previously, though I wished to inquire about my faults after being reproved,
I encountered urgent travel matters and had no leisure to do so.
Now, having arrived at my host’s dwelling and finding myself at ease with no pressing affairs,
I earnestly hope to hear your instructive words,
so that I may benefit from them in the future.

**[Release Notes]**
*"Not at ease"* (不闲) is pronounced *xián* (闲).
Below, it is read the same.
One reading follows the character directly.

Laozi says:
*"With your haughty glare and domineering stare—
who would dwell with you?
Great purity may seem like shame;
abundant virtue may seem insufficient."*

**[1] [Annotation]**
*"Haughty glare and domineering stare"* (睢睢盱盱) depicts arrogance and overbearing demeanor.
People will fear the difficulty and keep their distance.

**[Commentary]**
*"Haughty glare"* (睢睢) and *"dominating stare"* (盱盱) suggest restless, tyrannical authority.
*"You"* (而) refers to yourself.
With your overbearing manner and ostentatious display,
all others recoil in sorrow—
who would choose to dwell with you?

**[Release Notes]**
*"Haughty glare"* (睢睢) is pronounced *guī hū wéi fǎn* (郭呼维反) or *xú xǔ guī fǎn* (徐许圭反).
*"Dominating stare"* (盱盱) is pronounced *xiāng yú fǎn* (香于反), also *xǔ wú fǎn* (许

「**[1]** The sovereignty of the world is the heaviest of burdens—
yet it does not harm one’s life to hold it;
how much less could other trifles concern you! **[2]**
Only those who do not seek the world’s sovereignty
can be entrusted with it. **[3]**

**[1] [Annotation]**
The deeds of Yao and Shun are recorded in the inner chapters.
The surname was **Zi**, the given name **Zhou**, and the courtesy name **Zhi Fu**—
a man who embraced the Dao, a recluse.
Yao recognized his virtue and offered him the imperial throne.
If I were to be Emperor,
I could certainly govern well,
so I say, *"It is indeed acceptable for me."*
**幽** (deep) and **忧** (labor) imply
my heart is immersed in profound reflection,
and I seek to cultivate my self,
striving to align with the Dao,
leaving no leisure to attend to the myriad affairs of state. **[Annotation]**
*"Zi Zhou Zhi Fu"* (子州支父) is pronounced **Fǔ** (甫).
Li Yun notes: *Zhi Fu* is his courtesy name, the same as *Zhi Bo* (支伯).
Wang Yun explains: *"幽忧之病"* (afraid of sorrow's illness) refers to his deep and enduring affliction.

**[Commentary]**
The imperial throne, with its weight of authority,
is the most exalted position among all human stations—
yet even this supreme honor does not cause him to neglect his life.
How much less could other lesser matters occupy his mind!

**[3] [Annotation]**
Only those who forget the world,
who do not seek its sovereignty,
can be entrusted with it.
Shun offered the world to **Zi Zhou Zhi Bo** (子州支伯).
**Zi Zhou Zhi Bo** said:
*"I am afflicted with a deep and laboring illness;
I must first heal myself,
leaving no time to govern the world."* **[1]**
Thus, the sovereignty of the world is a great responsibility,
yet he does not exchange his life for it—
this is how those who follow the Dao differ from the common crowd. **[2]**

**[1] [Annotation]**
Shun’s deeds are recorded in the inner chapters.
**Zhi Bo** is the same as **Zhi Fu**.

**[Annotation]**
Yu Zhi notes: *The Records of the Grand Historian* lists **Zi Zhou Zhi Fu** (子州支父)
but not **Zhi Bo** (支伯),
so **Zhi Fu** and **Zhi Bo** are one person.

**[2] [Annotation]**
The imperial throne is a heavy and great responsibility—
yet he does not barter his life for its honor.
Who but one who follows the Dao could remain so steadfast?
Thus, his conduct stands apart from the vulgar crowd.

Shun offered the world to **Shan Juan** (善卷),
who said:
*"I stand within the cosmos,
wearing animal furs in winter and coarse linen in summer;
spring, I till and sow, my body laboring enough;
autumn, I harvest and store, my body resting with sustenance."*」

The sun rises and I labor; the sun sets and I rest,
drifting freely between Heaven and Earth while my heart finds contentment.
Why should I covet the world? **[1]**
Alas, you do not understand me!
And so he refused.

Then he departed and entered the deep mountains,
where no one knew his whereabouts. **[2]**

**[1]**
Surname **Shan** (善), given name **Juan** (卷), a recluse.
Dwelling within the six directions, harmonizing with the four seasons,
he found fulfillment between Heaven and Earth,
soaring beyond worldly filth—
the Dao was within him, so he did not seek the world.

**[Annotation]**
*Shan Juan* (善卷): *Juan* (卷) reads *quàn* (勉反) or *jù* (居阮反), also *juàn* (眷).
Li (李) notes: Surname **Shan**, given name **Juan**.
Yu Zhi (俞樾) says: *The Treatise on Exalted Worth* (吕览下贤篇) renders it **Shan Zhěn** (善绻).
*Clothing furs* (衣皮): *yú* (于既反). Same below.

**[2]**
The ancients were pure and simple.
They addressed the Emperor as "child."
He lamented that Shun did not grasp the heart of the wild,
thus his sigh of sorrow.

Shun offered the world to his friend, the farmer of **Shíhòu** (石户),
who said:
*"Rolls and toils, this man of later times—
a man of unyielding strength! **[1]**
"*Shun’s virtue has not yet reached its fullness,"*
and so husband bore his wife on his back,
father carried his child in his arms,
and they entered the sea together,
never to return. **[2]**

**[1]**
*Hòu* (户) is also written as *hòu* (后), read as the character demands.
**Shíhòu** (石户) is a place name.
*Agriculturalist* (农) refers to a person—today, in the south, "farmer" (农) is how one addresses another.
This was Shun’s friend.
*Bo* (葆) means steadfast.
He said that Shun’s resolve was unshaken,
his sinews and strength laboring without rest,
his back bent from toil—
because of his ceaseless exertion,
he now offered the world in return,
and so he refused.

**[Annotation]**
*Shíhòu* (石户) is also written as *Shíhòu* (后).
*The farmer* (之农): Li (李) notes: **Shíhòu** (石户) is a place name.

「Agriculturalist, a commoner indeed. **[2]**

*The bent and weary* (卷卷) is pronounced *quán*, with *Guō* reading it as *juàn*—a depiction of exerting effort.
*Steadfast in strength* (葆力) is pronounced *bǎo*, also written as *bǎo*.

**[2]**
Ancient folk bore burdens,
often by head-carrying—
even now, in Koryŏ, this custom remains.
Since Shun’s **virtue/power** and transformation
had not yet reached their ultimate heights,
he took his wife and child,
refusing to set foot on their land,
and entered the vast **sea-island** (海州岛),
never to return.

**[Annotation]**
*Entered the sea* (以入于海): Sima [commentary] states:
Whenever "enter" (入) is mentioned,
it refers to dwelling upon the islands
or in the bays of the sea.

King Dànfù resided in **Mín** (邠) **[1]**
when the **Dì** (狄) people attacked **[1]**.
He offered them **leather and silk** (皮帛) but they refused,
he offered them **dogs and horses** (犬马) but they refused,
he offered them **jewels and jade** (珠玉) but they refused—
for the **Dì** people sought only land.

King Dànfù said:
*“To share a dwelling with a man’s brother
yet slay his younger sibling,
to share a dwelling with a man’s father
yet slay his own child—
I cannot bear it.
All of you, make yourselves at home!
What difference does it make
whether you serve as my subjects
or as the **Dì** people’s subjects?”*

「**[2]** Moreover, I have heard that one should not harm what one cherishes with what one uses to nourish it. **[2]**»
He then took his staff and left.
The people of **Mín** followed him in solidarity,
and thus he established his state beneath **Qí** Mountain.

**[3]** Indeed, King Dànfù **[3]****
could be said to honor life **[3]**.
Those who honor life,
though noble and wealthy, do not let nourishment harm their bodies,
though poor and lowly, do not let gain burden their forms.
Yet people of today who hold high office and noble rank,
all fear losing it and, seeing profit, lightly abandon their lives—
how can they not be deluded? **[4]**

*Shì* (事) means to offer.

*Xī* (奚) means what.

The **Dì** people are greedy and cruel, their hearts set on land—
I cannot bear to harm or slay them, so you must strive and dwell there.

**[3]**
**[Annotation]**
*Yòng yǎng* (用养), the land that sustains.
*Suǒ yǎng* (所养), the people sustained.
Originally, the land was used to nourish the people,
but now they kill the people to preserve the land—
thus, it is wrong.
Leaning on his staff, he departed,
and the people followed in procession,
thereby establishing a state at **Qíyáng**.

**[Annotation]**
*《Bù yǐ suǒ yòng yǎng hài suǒ yǎng》*
The land is what sustains the people;
now they contend by killing the people—
this is harming the people with the land.
Since the people are nourished by the land,
one must not harm the people for the sake of the land.

**[Annotation]**
In chaotic times, falsehoods prevail,
and hearts grow shallow and fickle.
They chase after rank and title and lose their lives,
pursue wealth and profit and perish their fates—
they know not the light from the heavy,
deeply ensnared in delusion.

**[Annotation]**
*《Bù yǐ yǎng shāng shēn, bù yǐ lì lèi xíng》*
The **Wáng** says:
The wealthy have nourishment, yet do not let it harm their bodies,
the poor lack gain, yet do not let pursuit of profit burden their forms.

**[Annotation]**
*(One)* The character *mèi* (昧) is corrected according to the original text in the annotation. The **Yuè** people killed their kings in three generations;
**Wángzǐ Sōu** feared this fate,
and fled to the **Dān Xué** cave.

The **Yue** state had no ruler, and though they sought **Prince Sou**, they could not find him. He followed them into the **Dan Xue** cave. **Prince Sou** refused to emerge, so the **Yue** people smoked him out with mugwort. They then conveyed him in the **Wang yu** [1].

**Prince Sou**, grasping the reins, ascended the carriage and, gazing heavenward, cried:
*"O ruler! O ruler! Why must you abandon me?"*

**Prince Sou** did not despise being ruler—he despised the calamities of rule. A man like **Prince Sou** may be said to have spared his life for the sake of his state, and this was precisely what the **Yue** people wished to find in their ruler [2].

---
**[1]**
**[Annotation]**
Sou was the name of the prince. **Dan Xue** was a cave in the southern mountain. The **Wang yu** was the ruler’s carriage. Some texts render this as *yu yu* [1], reading it as *yu li* (玉辂).

The people of **Yue**, having repeatedly slain their sovereigns, fled in terror to the cave. Though summoned, **Prince Sou** would not come out, so they smoked him with mugwort. Once they begged him to rule, they conveyed him in the **Yu yu**.

**[Annotation]**
*《弒其》* sounds like *shì*.
*《王子搜》* read as *sū* (素羔反), also *sōu* (悉遘反), or *yáo* (邀遘反). Li [commentator] says: "The prince’s name." The *Huainanzi* renders it as *yì*.
◎Yu Yu says: The annotation reads: *Sou*, the *Huainanzi* renders as *yì*. Yet there is no account of three generations of regicide before *Yì*. The *Shiji*’s *Yue shijia* *Suoyin* takes *Sou* as *Yì*’s son, Wu Zhen. According to the *Zhushu Jinian*, *Yì* was slain by his son, the **Yue** people killed his son, and installed Wu Yu, who was also slain, and Wu Zhen was enthroned. Thus, before Wu Zhen, the three rulers all met untimely ends—**Prince Sou** must surely be another name for Wu Zhen. The *Huainanzi* likely erred in transmission; the *Suoyin*’s correction should be adopted.
*《丹穴》* The *Erya* states: "The southern peak, where the sun rises, is called **Dan Xue**."
*《以艾》* read as *wèi* (五盖反).
*《王舆》* One text reads *Yu yu*.

「**Section II**
**Commentary:**
*Yuan* means "to draw" or "to pull."
*Suī* refers to the rope on a chariot.
When words fail to avert disaster, one sighs deeply and boards the carriage—not out of hatred for the ruler, but fear of calamity.
Since life is more precious than rank, one may be bent to serve as ruler.

**Textual Notes:**
*《Yuan》* pronounced *yuán* (as in "爰").
*《ér hū》* pronounced with the *huǒ-gù* rhyme.
The original may also read *tàn* (sigh).
*《yǐ shě》* pronounced *shě* (as in "舍").
*《fēi è》* pronounced *wū-lù* (乌路反).
The same *è* (恶) appears in the following passage and the next chapter.

**Collations:**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s copy reads *wáng* (王) as *yù* (玉).
(2) *Yāo gòu* (邀遘) is likely a misreading for *yāo* (邀).

The states of **Han** and **Wei** clashed over borderlands.
**Zi Hua Zi** visited **Zhao Xi Xi Hou**, who wore a troubled expression **[1]**.
Zi Hua Zi said:
*"If I were to inscribe a maxim before you and write: ‘Seizing it with the left hand will cost the right, seizing it with the right hand will cost the left—yet whoever seizes it shall rule all under Heaven—would you dare to seize it?’ **[2]**"*

---
**Commentary [1]:**
Zhao Xi Xi Hou was the ruler of **Han**.
Zi Hua Zi was a virtuous man of **Wei**.
As neighboring states, **Han** and **Wei** contested territories, arms clashed, and victory remained uncertain. The ruler’s anxious demeanor reflected his unease.

**Textual Notes:**
*《Zǐ Huá Zǐ》* Sima [Bian] notes: "A man of **Wei**."
◎Yu Yu remarks:
*The Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *"Guì Shēng"* (貴生) cites **Zi Hua Zi** as saying:
*"Preserving life whole is supreme; partial loss is secondary; death is worse; and being forced to act against one’s will is the lowest."*
Again, in *"Miù Tú"* (誣徒), it cites **Zi Hua Zi**:
*"The sovereign rejoices in the means by which he rules; the fallen rejoices in the means by which he fell."*
Gao [You] annotates both passages, calling **Zi Hua Zi** an ancient Daoist recluse.
The terms *"zhī dù"* (知度) and *"shěn wéi"* (審為) appear in both commentaries.
*《Zhāo Xī Xī Hóu》* Sima [Bian] notes: "The ruler of **Han**."
◎Yu Yu observes:
**Han** had a **Zhao Hou** and a **Xi Wang**, but no **Zhao Xi Xi Hou**.

---
**Commentary [2]:**
*Míng* refers to inscribed records.
*Shuò* means "to grasp."
*Fèi* means "to sever" (or "to discard").
If an inscribed maxim were placed before you—*"Take it with the left hand, and the right is cut; take it with the right hand, and the left is cut—yet whoever takes it shall rule all under Heaven"*—would you dare to take it?
*(This is a metaphorical question addressed to the ruler of **Han**.)*

**Textual Notes:**
*《Shuò》* pronounced *jù-bì* (俱碧) or *jù-fù* (俱缚), or *shǐ-jué* (史虢).
Li [Fan] explains: "To take."
◎Lu Wenbin notes:
The old pronunciation *jù-bì* (俱碧) and *jù-fù* (俱缚), or *shǐ-jué* (史虢), are erroneous.
Now corrected according to the Song edition.
*《Fèi》* Li [Fan] explains: "To abandon."
Sima [Bian] explains: "To fall ill."
Another reading clarifies:
*"Shuò"* refers to grasping the inscribed maxim;
*"Fèi"* refers to severing the right hand.

**Collations:**
(1) The Gao Shan Temple edition omits the character *néng* (能) after *jūn* (君).
Zhao Xi Xi Hou replied:
*"I would not dare to seize it. **[1]**."*

Zhao Xi Xi Hou replied:
*"I cannot sever both arms to claim all under Heaven."*

Zi Hua Zi said:
*"Excellent! **[1]** From this perspective, one’s arms are heavier than the realm, and one’s life is heavier still than one’s arms. The weight of **Han** compared to the realm is already far lighter **[2]**, and what you now contend for is even lighter than **Han** itself. Your lordship is indeed burdening your body and endangering your life in vain distress over what you cannot obtain!"* **[1]**

**[1] Citation:** Praising the lord’s words as perfectly reasoned.
**[2] Citation:** *Zhì* (自) here means *from* (i.e., *from this perspective*).

When examined thus, one’s life weighs more than one’s arms, one’s arms more than the realm, and the realm more than **Han**—yet the disparity between **Han** and the realm is vast. **[1]**

**[3] Citation:** What you now dispute is merely a borderland, yet you fixate on it with such sorrow, harming your body and depleting your vitality—all for something you may never attain. Is this not perplexing?

**Textual Notes:**
*《其轻于韩又远》* pronounced *jué-jù* (绝句).

**Collations:**
(1) The character *yì* (亦) restored from the main text.

Lai Hou said:
*"Well spoken! Many have instructed me, yet I have never heard such words before."*

Zi Hua Zi truly understands the balance of weight and measure. **[1]**

**[1] Citation:** Astonished by his sudden enlightenment and its brilliance.

The ruler of **Lu** had heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the **Dao**. He sent envoys with gifts to precede him. **[1]**

Yan He tended his humble gate, clad in coarse hempen robes, and fed himself by plowing oxen. **[2]**

When the **Lu** envoy arrived, Yan He received him himself. The envoy asked:
*"Is this the home of Yan He?"*
Yan He replied:
*"This is my home."*

The envoy presented the gifts, but Yan He said:
*"I fear that if I accept, those who hear of it may misconstrue and blame the envoy. It would be better to verify this first."*

The envoy returned and confirmed the matter, then came again—only then did Yan He accept.

**[3]** Thus, one like Yan He truly despised wealth and nobility.

**[1] Citation:** The ruler of **Lu**—either **Lu Ai Gong** or, as some say, **Lu Ding Gong**—of the **Yan** clan, named **He**, a recluse from **Lu**. *Bì* (币) refers to silk.
Having heard that Yan He embodied the **Dao** of purity and integrity, the ruler wished to appoint him as prime minister, so he sent envoys bearing silk to convey his intent.

**Textual Notes:**
*《鲁君》* alternatively reads *Lu Hou* (鲁侯).
Li [Fan] explains: *"Ai Gong."*

「**[2] Citation:** *Jūbù*, coarse hemp cloth. *Fàn*, to feed. Dwelling in humble alleys, clad in rough garments, he himself fed the oxen—thus clearly demonstrating his poverty and frugality.

**[3] Citation:** *Yú*, to give. Not wishing to accept the gifts, he feigned these words to deceive the envoy.
◎Yu Yü said: The character *yú* (欲) is a redundant repetition. "Fearful that those who hear may err and blame the envoy" means he feared the envoy might be blamed for mishearing.

**Textual Notes:**
*Jū* (苴) is pronounced *cū* (粗), with the rhyme of *qīyú* (七余). Li Fan explains: "It is hemp cloth with child threads." The original sometimes reads *cū* (粗), but this is incorrect.
*Fànniú* (饭牛) is pronounced *fǎnwǎn* (符晚).

*Yú* (遗) here means "to give." The envoy’s hearing (*tīng*) refers to the envoy himself, not a single listener. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Guìshēng* chapter correctly reads: *"Fearful that the hearing may be erroneous and blame fall upon the envoy."*

**Textual Variants:**
*《之使》* pronounced *suǒlì* (所吏).
*《家与》* pronounced *yú* (余).
*《而遗》* pronounced *wéiyí* (唯季).
*《复来》* pronounced *fú* (服) or *fúyòu* (扶又).
The following chapter follows the same readings.

**[Collation Note]**
(1) The omitted passage incorrectly cites Zhang Junfang’s text as *囗* (obscured).»

Thus it is said: The **Dao/Way**’s true essence is for cultivating oneself, its residual **virtue/power** for the state, and its coarse **qi** for governing the world. From this perspective, the labors of the **emperors** and **sages** are but the remnants of **saintly** affairs, not what is needed to perfect oneself and nurture life **[1]**. Yet today’s common **scholars** often endanger their own lives and abandon their existence to serve trivial matters—how tragic!

In all things, the **sage** must examine both the **means** by which he acts and the **ends** he pursues **[2]**. Now suppose **[1]** there is a man here who uses the **Random Lord’s Pearl** to shoot a sparrow at a height of a thousand *rèn*—the world would surely mock him. Why? Because what he employs is precious, yet what he seeks is trifling.

Life itself—is it not far more weighty than the **Random Lord’s Pearl**? **[3]**

**[1]**
**Explication:** *Glǔ* (绪) means "leftover" or "remnant." *Tǔ* (土) is "dung," and *jū* (苴) is "grass." Those who apply the true **Dao/Way** to sustain themselves must regard state affairs as remnants and treat the world like dung and grass.

**Textual Notes:** *Glǔyú* (绪余) follows the reading as written. *Xū* (徐) is pronounced *shē* (奢) above, *jiē* (嗟) below. Li Fan explains: *Glǔ* means "leftover," referring to remnants. ◎Qìngfān’s annotation in the *Wénxuǎn* (文选) cites Li Fan’s note on *Sǐmǎ Zǐcháng Bàorèn Shǎoqiè Shū* (司马子长报任少卿书): *Glǔ* means "leftover" or "remnant." This is more concise than the **Textual Notes**. *Tǔ* (土) is pronounced *chìyǎ* (敕雅), *piànjiǎ* (片贾), or *rú* (如) as written. *Jū* (苴) is pronounced *zèyǎ* (侧雅) or *zhīyǎ* (知雅). Li Fan says: *Tǔjū* (土苴) is like dung and grass. Sima Qian notes: *Tǔjū* (土苴) means "worthless remnants," all untrue things. Another explanation: *Tǔjū* (土苴) describes the appearance of "being without purpose."

**[2]**
**Explication:** *Yùn* (殉) means "to follow" or "to pursue." The **sage** observes where people go and what they say, then acts accordingly.

**[3]**
The **Random Lord**’s state was near the **Pu River** (濮水), where the **Pu River** yielded a precious pearl—this was the one the **sacred serpent** bore in gratitude for a debt, which the **Random Lord** obtained. Thus, it is called the **Random Lord’s Pearl**. Now, if a sparrow is perched a thousand *rèn* high and one uses this pearl to shoot it, the object sought is light, yet the means employed are heavy. To risk one’s life for trivial matters—this too is such folly.

**Textual Notes:** *Suǒyào* (所要) is pronounced *yáo* (遥). ◎Yú Yè says: Below *Random Lord* (随侯) should have *Pearl* (珠). Without it, the meaning is insufficient. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Guìshēng* chapter reads: *Life itself—is it not far more weighty than the Random Lord’s Pearl?* One should follow and supplement this.

**[Collation Note]**
(1) The **High Mountain Temple** edition omits the *mǎ* (且) above.

**Sima Zǐliè** (子列子) grew gaunt from hunger. A visitor spoke to **Zhèng Zǐyáng** (郑子阳), saying: *"Sima Zǐliè, the **Random Lord**—truly a man of **Dao/Way**—dwells in your lordship’s realm yet suffers want. Does your lordship not fear that this may be seen as a failing in your virtue?"* **[1]** Zhèng Zǐyáng immediately ordered an official to give him grain. **Sima Zǐliè**, upon seeing the envoy, bowed twice and declined **[2]**.

**[1]**
**Explication:** *Zǐyáng* (子阳) was the **Chancellor** of **Zhèng**. **Sima Zǐliè** (御寇) was a **Zhèng**-man with **Dao/Way** yet in poverty. **Zhèng Zǐyáng**’s cruelty drove away worthy **scholars**, and wandering guests criticized him.

**Textual Notes:** *Zǐyáng* (子阳) was the **Chancellor**. *Bùhǎo* (不好) is pronounced *hūbào* (呼报).

**[2]**
**Explication:** The **Chancellor** summoned the **Granary Overseer** and commanded him to give grain. **Sima Zǐliè**, being pure and exalted, declined and refused to accept it.

**Textual Notes:** *Jìlìng* (即令) is pronounced *lìchéng* (力呈).

As the envoy departed, **Sima Zǐliè** entered, and his wife, upon seeing him, struck her chest and exclaimed: *"I have heard that the wives and children of men of **Dao/Way** all enjoy ease and happiness, yet now he has a hungry look. When your lordship passed by and gave him food, he did not accept it—is this not a command from Heaven? **[1]!"**

**[1]**
**Explication:** Though given grain, he refused it—Heaven’s decree that he remain poor. She sighed and struck her chest, blaming her husband’s fault.

Thus, it is clear that **Sima Zǐliè**’s wife was far inferior to **Lǎolái**’s consort.

**Textual Notes:** *Fǔxīn* (拊心) is pronounced *fǔ* (抚) in **Xu**’s reading. *Déyì* (得佚) is pronounced *yì* (逸). *Lè* (乐) is pronounced *luò* (洛). *Jūn guò* (君过) is pronounced *wù* (卧) in the ancient form, or *yù* (遇).

**[Collation Note]**
(1) The **High Mountain Temple** edition reads: *"Is this not a command from Heaven?"* as *"Is this not Heaven’s decree?"* (岂非命也哉).

**Sima Zǐliè** smiled and said to her: *"Your lordship does not truly know me. He gave me grain based on others’ words, and when he blames me, he will again rely on others’ words—this is why I do not accept it."* Soon after, the people indeed rebelled and killed **Zhèng Zǐyáng**.

**[1]**
**Explication:** **Zhèng Zǐyáng** was harsh and cruel, and many resented him. His attendants had once broken his bow in error, fearing they would incur his wrath. When the people drove out a **wild dog**, they seized the opportunity to kill him.

**Textual Notes:** *Zùnàn* (作难) is pronounced *nàidàn* (乃旦). Below, the next chapter follows the same. *Shā Zǐyáng* (杀子阳): **Zhèng Zǐyáng**’s severity knew no pardon. His retainers, fearing his anger, killed him during the chaos of the people driving out a **wild dog**.

◎Yú Yè notes: The account of **Zhèng Zǐyáng** appears in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shìwēi* (适威) chapter and the *Huáinán*’s *Fànlùn Xuàn* (泛论训). However, the *Shǐjì*’s **Zhèng** clan annals state: In the twenty-fifth year of **Zhèng Wū** (繻公), the **Duke** of **Zhèng** killed his **Chancellor**, **Zhèng Zǐyáng**. In the twenty-seventh year, **Zhèng Zǐyáng**’s followers conspired to assassinate **Zhèng Wū**, yet this differs from other texts.

When **Chǔ Zhāo Wáng** (楚昭王) lost his kingdom, **Túyáng Shuì** (屠羊说) fled and followed him **[1]**. When **Chǔ Zhāo Wáng** recovered his kingdom, he intended to reward those who had followed him, and when he reached **Túyáng Shuì**...

Túyáng Shuì said, *"Great King lost his kingdom, and I lost my position as butcher of sheep; Great King recovered his kingdom, and I also return to butchering sheep. My rank and stipends have already been restored—what further reward could there be?"*

◎Commentary: Great King **Chǔ Zhāo Wáng** was named **Zhěn**, a son of **Píng Wáng**. **Wǔ Shì** and **Wǔ Shàng** were executed by **Píng Wáng**, while **Zǐyú** fled to **Wú**, tilling the fields in exile. Later, in the reign of **Wú Wáng Hé Lǘ**, he requested troops to attack **Chǔ**, thus breaking into **Yǐng** and avenging his father’s **chóu** (仇).

At that time, **Zhāo Wáng** was in dire straits, abandoning his kingdom and fleeing first to **Suí**, then to **Zhèng**. There was a lowly butcher named **Shuì**, who followed the king in his flight. The reasons for his flight are detailed below.

◎Textual Notes: *"Chǔ Zhāo Wáng"* was named **Zhěn**, son of **Píng Wáng**. *"Túyáng Shuì"* is pronounced **yuè**, or sometimes read as the character. The king said, *"Force him!"* Túyáng Shuì replied, *"Great King lost his kingdom—this was not my crime, so I dared not submit to his punishment; Great King recovered his kingdom—this was not my merit, so I dared not accept his reward."* The king said, *"Show yourself!"*

Túyáng Shuì replied:
*"The laws of Chu decree that one must earn great rewards and perform mighty deeds before being granted an audience. Yet my wisdom was insufficient to preserve the kingdom, and my courage was insufficient to face the enemy. When the Wu army entered Yǐng, I feared the difficulty and avoided the foe—not out of loyalty to Your Majesty, but from self-preservation. Now, if Your Majesty would abandon the law and break the covenant just to see me, this would not be the conduct by which I wish to be known across the world."*

The king then said to **Sīmǎ Zǐ Qí**:
*"Túyáng Shuì, though of lowly station, has set forth lofty principles. Zǐ Qí, offer him the rank of one of the Three Edlers [or: Three Ministers]."*

---
**Túyáng Shuì** said:
*"I know that the rank of the Three Edlers is nobler than that of a butcher’s stall, and that the emoluments of ten thousand *zhòng* are richer than the profits of a butcher’s trade. Yet could I, for the sake of rank and wealth, allow my lord to bear the reputation of reckless bestowal? I dare not accept it. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall."*

And so he refused.

*"Original Xiān resided in Lu, dwelling in a wattle-and-daub hut, its walls thatched with wild grass; its door of woven reeds was incomplete, its hinge made of a willow branch."*

「Yet the dwelling of **Yuán Xiān** was but a jar-windowed hut with two rooms, his coarse hempen garments serving as curtains. Rain leaked through the roof, dampness seeped from below, and he sat upright, playing his *xián* (一) and singing (一) in self-amusement.

(一) *Xián* here refers to *xián-gē* (弦歌), the plucking of strings and singing.

---

**Zǐ Gòng** rode in a grand carriage, draped in indigo inner robes and plain outer ones, so imposing that its canopy blocked the alleyway. He went to visit **Yuán Xiān**.

**Yuán Xiān** wore a cap of fine *huá* (一) (一) leather, his sandals without soles, and leaned on a staff of *lí* (藜) while answering the door himself (二).

(一) **Zǐ Gòng**, a disciple of Confucius, named Gòng (赐), skilled in speech and fond of splendor.

(二) *Yí* (縰) means to step lightly. **Yuán Xiān** used a cap made of fine *huá* (一) (一) wood’s bark, a staff of *lí* (藜) and *huì* (藿), and since he had no servants, he answered the door himself.

---

**Zǐ Gòng** exclaimed:
*"Ah! Master, what ails you?"*

Yuán Xiān replied:
*"I have heard this saying: Lack of wealth is called poverty, but learning without practice is called illness. Now, I am poor, but not ill."*

Zǐ Gòng hesitated and wore a look of shame.

Yuán Xiān laughed and said:
*"To seek the world’s approval in one’s actions, to curry favor with influential friends, to study for others’ gain, and to teach for one’s own—these are the deceits of benevolence and righteousness, the ostentations of carriages and horses. I cannot bear to do them."*

Thus, those who cultivate their spirit forget bodily comforts; those who nourish their form forget profit; and those who attain the **Dao/Way** forget their very selves.

Once, when **Zēng Zǐ** dwelt in **Wèi**, his patched robes had no outer layer, his skin was parched and cracked, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not kindle a fire, and for ten years he did not make new clothes. His hat’s cord frayed and snapped, his sleeves were torn so that his elbows showed, his sandals were so worn that the soles split apart. He dragged his unsoled sandals and sang the **Shāng** and **Sòng** hymns, his voice filling the heavens and earth, as if it came from metal and stone. Neither the **Son of Heaven** could secure him as a minister, nor the feudal lords could claim him as a friend. Hence, the man who nourishes his spirit forgets his body, the man who nourishes his body forgets gain, and the man who attains the **Dao/Way** forgets his heart.

「【Three】【Commentary】 His voice resounded like the **Shāng** and **Sòng** hymns (resonating), harmonizing with the **gōng-shāng** tones, and examining their lyrical meaning, it aligned with the **Yǎ**—the refined, cosmic order—echoing through heaven and earth. His **qi** and voice were pure and lofty, resonant like metal and stone, his demeanor noble and unadorned, surpassing the bounds of human conduct. Thus, neither the **Son of Heaven** could appoint him as a minister, nor the feudal lords could claim him as a friend.

【Four】【Commentary】 The **virtuous** and **accomplished** man does not let physical adversity diminish his resolve; the **humble and vigilant** do not let material gain harm their life. The man who attains the **Dao/Way** forgets the **heart-knowing** arts of ambition. Confucius said to **Yán Huí**: *"Huí, come! Though your family is poor and your dwelling humble, why do you not seek office?"* **Yán Huí** replied: *"I do not wish to take office. I have fifty *mǔ* of fields outside the city walls, enough to provide rice gruel; ten *mǔ* of fields within the walls, sufficient for flax and hemp. Playing the *qín* brings me joy, and what I have learned from my Master’s **Dao/Way** brings me contentment. I do not wish to take office."*

Confucius’ face grew grave, his expression changed, and he said: *"Noble indeed is Huí’s resolve! I have long recited: ‘The contented man does not burden himself with worldly gain; the man who knows his own worth loses nothing without fear; the man whose **virtue/power** is cultivated inwardly feels no shame without rank.’ I have chanted these words for ages, yet only now do I see them embodied in Huí—this is my true understanding."*」

The *Commentary* states:
*"Mí*—deer. *Zuò*—shame.*

The man who finds contentment in himself is not disturbed by gain or loss;
the one who cultivates his inner **virtue/power** feels no shame without rank!

Confucius had long recited these words, yet now he urged Huí to seek office—was this not a misstep?
Only when Huí reflected did he say, *"This is my true understanding."*

---
**Exegesis:**
*"Zhōu"*—reversed as *rán*.
Some texts render it as *"zhān"*—gruel.
*The Broad雅* says: *"Mí"*—also means *"ruined"* or *"broken."*
Another reading: *"jǐ yán"*—*jǐ* as in *"jǐ yán"* (to record).
*The Family Sayings* calls it *"thick gruel."*
One pronunciation: *"gān"*—as in *"gān □"* (now corrected from *"bǐng"* to *"yù"*).
*"Zhōu"*—sixth tone, also *"yù"*.
*"Zì yú"*—pronounced *"luò"*.
*"Qiào"*—seventh tone, *"xiù"* in *Jiǔ Zhōu*, also *"liǎo"* (seventh tone, *"liǎo"* as in *"liǎo"*).
*"Xíng xiū"*—below *"méng"* tone.
*"Bù zuò"*—*"luò"* tone.
*The Erya* says: *"shame."*
Also pronounced *"zuò"* (as in *"zuò"*).

**Collation:**
(1) The text omits *"xiàn"* (envy), citing *Jiāngnán Lǐ Shì*’s version as *"xiàn."*

**Middle Mountain Prince Móu** asked **Zhān Zǐ**:
*"Though I dwell upon the rivers and seas, my heart lingers beneath the **Arcade of Wei**—what should I do?"*

**Zhān Zǐ** replied:
*"Hold life most dear.
If life is held most dear, then worldly gain becomes light."*

**Middle Mountain Prince Móu** said:
*"Though I understand this, I cannot yet overcome myself."*

---
**Exegesis:**
*Zhān Zǐ*—a virtuous man of **Wei**.
Prince Móu of **Wei**, sealed as Middle Mountain, hence *"Middle Mountain Prince Móu."*
Though he harbored aspirations of retreat, lacking the **Dao/Way** of lofty detachment, he lingered between the rivers and seas while his heart clung to the splendor beneath the **Arcade of Wei**. Upon seeing a sage, he inquired of his method.

**Exegesis:**
*"Middle Mountain Prince Móu"*—Sima Qian says: A prince of **Wei**, sealed as Middle Mountain, named Móu.
*Zhān Zǐ*—a virtuous man. *Huáinán Zǐ* renders it as *"Zhān."*
*"Arcade of Wei"*—*Huáinán Zǐ* renders it as *"qí"* (later corrected to *"wèi"*).
Sima Qian’s text aligns, explaining *"qí"* as *"wèi"*—symbolizing the royal gate, where the sovereign’s heart resides in honor.
Xu Shēn states: *"The two observatories of the Son of Heaven."*

Lu Wénpiàn notes: *"Today, Huáinán Zǐ also renders it as ‘Wei.’"*

*Zhān Zǐ* said:
*"Hold life most dear.
If one cherishes the **Dao/Way** of life, then fame and profit become insignificant."*

**Exegesis:**
*"Hold life most dear"*—Li Shǒu explains: *"If one upholds the **Dao/Way** of life, then fame and profit grow light—lightness makes them easy to abandon."*

This man, though dwelling by the rivers and seas, still coveted honor and profit, so this admonition was given to him.

**Middle Mountain Prince Móu** said:
*"Though I know this, I cannot yet conquer myself."*

**Exegesis:**
*"Conquer"*—pronounced *"shēng"* (as in *"ascend"*).
Same below.

The **Zhānxian Zǐ** said:
*"If one cannot conquer oneself, then one should follow [one’s desires].
What harm can there be to the spirit?
If one cannot conquer oneself yet forcibly resists, this is called **severe injury**.
Those who suffer **severe injury** will have no longevity."*

**Exegesis:**
*"If one cannot conquer oneself, then one should follow"*—
If one cannot overcome desire, then one ought to yield to the heart’s will, lest one vainly generate resentment or ill will.

**Release Notes:**
*"Unable to conquer oneself, then follow"*—a complete sentence.
One reading breaks at *"god"* (神) as a separate sentence.
◎Yú Yì remarked:
*"The Release Notes say, ‘Unable to conquer oneself, then follow’ is a complete sentence—this reading is correct.
Again, it says, ‘One reading breaks at *god* as a separate sentence’—this is incorrect.
The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* ‘*Examine Responses*’ chapter also records this matter, rendering it as ‘Unable to conquer oneself, then let go (纵之). What harm can there be to the spirit?’
The *Wénzǐ* ‘*Below Virtue*’ chapter and the *Huáinánzǐ* ‘*Dao/Way’s Response*’ chapter both repeat the character *from* (从) twice, as ‘*from it, from it*’ (从之从之), making clear that *from* (从) and *god* (神) should not be read together.
Again, considering that *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* uses *let go* (纵), it should be read with the *zì* (子) tone, yet the Release Notes provide no pronunciation, which is also incorrect.
*‘No harm’* (无恶)—as the character.
Also read as *wūlù* (乌路).
*‘Huh’* (乎)—a complete sentence.
One reading joins *‘unable to conquer oneself’* with the following as a single sentence."

**【II】【Commentary】**
Though emotions cannot be overcome, the heart’s purity is stifled, and its desires are already impaired—yet further it defies the natural course, hence the term *heavy wound* (重傷). Such a person will inevitably die young, and thus cannot be compared with those who live long and in good health.

**【Release Notes】**
*Heavy wound* (重傷) read as *zhíyòng* (直用).
Same below.

◎**Yu Yue** said: *Heavy wound* (重傷) means *double wound* (再傷). Unable to conquer oneself is already a wound; yet if one forcibly restrains it and does not allow it to flow freely, that is a double wound. Hence it is said: *This is what is meant by heavy wound*.

The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* ‘*Examine Responses*’ chapter’s annotation by Gao Yu reads: *heavy* (重) as a repetition of *heavy* (重). This is correct. The Release Notes’ pronunciation of *zhíyòng* (直用) is incorrect.

**【Collation】**
(1) The Zhao Jiànyì edition lacks the characters *heavy wound* (重傷).

Now, **Wei Mou** (衛牟), a prince of the *ten thousand chariots* (萬乘) rank, though he dwelled in caves and secluded himself in rugged grottoes, it was hard for him to surpass the common scholar—though he had not yet attained the Dao/Way, he possessed its spirit.

**【Collation】**
**【I】**
Though born to great royal lineage and honored with noble status, he could still dwell in caves and hide in valleys, enduring hardship in body—though he had not yet ascended to the mysterious Dao/Way, he held a pure and lofty aspiration, sufficient to stir the greedy and inspire the common folk.

**【Release Notes】**
*Ten thousand chariots* (萬乘) read as *shéngzhèng* (繩證).

Though **Confucius** was hard-pressed between **Chen** and **Cai**, going seven days without cooked food, his gruel unsifted, his countenance wan, yet he played the lute and sang in his chamber.

**Preface** (子路) and **Zigong** (子貢) conversed, saying: *“Our Master has been twice exiled from Lu, his path cut off in Wei, trees felled against him in Song, he was hard-pressed in Shang and Zhou, surrounded in Chen and Cai. Those who slay our Master are guiltless, those who borrow from him face no prohibition. Yet he never ceases his lute and song—is this the shamelessness of a gentleman?”*

**【I】**
**【Commentary】**
The matter of **Chen** and **Cai** has already been explained in the outer chapters.

**【I】**

**【Release Notes】**
*"Hunger and privation"* (饥馁) read as *qíhuì* (齐会).
*"No cooked food"* (无火食) read as *wúhuǒshí* (无火食).
*"Gruel of broomcorn millet, unsifted"* (藜菜之羹，不加米糁) read as *líkǎi zhī gēng, bù jiā mǐchǎn* (gruel of broomcorn millet, unsifted).
*"Yet he sang and took delight in music"* (颜色衰惫而歌乐自娱) read as *his countenance wan and weary, yet he sang and took delight in music*.
The **Dao/Way**-attuned sage, does not deem such trials as matters.

**【Release Notes】**
*"No cooked food"* (不火食) lacks the character *火* (huǒ) in the *Yuán Jiā* (元嘉) edition.
*"Unsifted"* (不糁) read as *bùshā* (不沙).
*"Wan and weary"* (甚惫) read as *shìbèi* (时备).

**【II】**
**【Commentary】**
He served in **Lu** yet was exiled, wandered in **Wei** yet his path was cut off, lectured beneath the trees in **Song** yet **Sima Kuangui** (司马桓魋) sought to kill the Master, hating where he sat, so he felled the trees. Thus, those who would kill the Master should bear no guilt, and those who would oppress him should face no prohibition. **Zilu** and **Zigong** were yet unenlightened, so they voiced such words.

**【Release Notes】**
*"Felled the trees in Song"* (伐树于宋) refers to **Confucius** visiting **Song** with his disciples, practicing rituals beneath a great tree, when **Song’s Sima Kuangui** sought to kill **Confucius**, so he felled the tree, and **Confucius** then departed.
*"Oppress"* (藉) means *to harm* (毁) or *to trample* (凌藉); also *to bore* (凿) or *to bind* (系).
**【Correction】** The *Zhào Jiànyì* (赵谏议) edition reads *"release"* (释) instead of *"choose"* (择). **Yan Hui** had no response, so he entered to report to **Confucius**.
**Confucius** pushed aside his lute and sighed deeply, saying: *“Zilu and Zigong are petty folk. I shall summon them and speak to them.”*

Zilu and Zigong entered. Zilu said, *“To reach such a state—this may truly be called ‘exhaustion’!*”

**【Release Notes】**
*"Sighed deeply"* (喟然) is a sigh of lamentation.
*"Zilu and Zigong"* are petty, trifling men.
He summoned them to come and spoke to them of the **Dao/Way**.

In such hardship, how could one not be exhausted?

**【Release Notes】**
*"Sighed"* (喟) is pronounced *kuì* (去愧反) or *kǔ* (苦怪反).
*"Spoke to them"* (语之) is pronounced *yǔjù* (鱼据反).

**Confucius** said, *“What words are these?*
To be *thorough* in the **Dao/Way** is to be *thorough*—that is *thoroughness*.
To be *exhausted* in the **Dao/Way** is to be *exhausted*—that is *exhaustion*.

Now, I, Zhōu, cling to the **Dao/Way** of *virtue* and *righteousness*, yet encounter the calamities of a chaotic age—what *exhaustion* could there be?
Thus, in self-reflection, I am not exhausted in the **Dao/Way**;
when facing peril, I do not lose my *virtue/power*.
When winter’s chill arrives and frost and snow descend,
I thereby know the thriving of pine and cypress.

The straits of **Chén-Cái**—for me, this is indeed fortune!”

**【Release Notes】**
*"Fortune"* (幸) refers to how the cold of winter distinguishes trees—
one knows the true scholar in adversity,
and *virtue/power* is revealed through trials—
this is indeed fortune.

**◎ Qìng Fān’s Note:** *"What exhaustion could there be?"* (何穷之为) —*"for"* (为) here means *"to say"* (谓).
In ancient usage, *for* (为) and *say* (谓) share the same meaning.
The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (*Palamedes’ Spring and Autumn*) *Shènrén* ("Advising the Ruler") chapter renders it *"what exhaustion to say?"* (何穷之谓).
The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* *Jīngyù* ("Explanations") chapter renders *"why not?"* as *"胡谓不可"* (胡为不可).
The *Hànshū* (*Han Records*) *Gāodì Jì* ("High Emperor’s Annals") renders *"for"* (为) as *"谓"* in *"Lì Shíjì"* (郦食其) as *"a village gatekeeper"* (里监门).
This is further evidence.

(*Note:* In the *Zhuàn* (*Leftist Commentary*), *"one"* (一) is used as *"to say"* (谓).
The *Hánshī Wàishuān* (*Han Poetry External Transmission*) uses *"What words"* (何谓) in *"King Wáng’s desire to use this speech."*
The *Xīnxù* (*New Sequence*) *Záshì* ("Miscellaneous Matters") uses *"What words"* (何谓) in *"How could it reach this?"*—
the character *say* (谓) is used interchangeably with *for* (为) in all these cases.)

**【Exegesis】**
In *"Confronting Peril"* (《临难》), it should read *"the great cold has arrived"* (大寒乃至). ◎ **Yu Yü** remarks: *"Tian"* (天) is a mistaken substitution for *"da"* (大). In the *Guoyu* (*Rulu*), *"Great Cold descends"* (大寒降), **Wei Zhao** annotates: *"This refers to the eleventh month (season of *Chou*), after the Great Cold."* If rendered as *"the cold of heaven has arrived"* (天寒既至), the meaning is lost. The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (*Palm Springs Annals*) *Shènrén* ("Cautious Person") chapter also records this event, correctly as *"Great Cold"* (大寒).

In *"The Narrow Pass"* (《之隘》), pronounced *è* (厄), also *xiè* (懈). **【Collation】**
(1) Zhao Jianyi’s copy reads *"lu"* (露) instead of *"xue"* (雪).
(2) The lacuna in the Jiangnan Ancient Cached Text inserts after *"mao ye"* (茂也): *"Huan Gong obtained it from Gu, Wen Gong from Cao, and the Yue King from Willow Ridge"* (桓公得之莒，文公得之曹，越王得之会稽), sixteen characters.

Confucius plucked his *qin* and sang with a *xuērán* (削然) sound, while **Zilu** brandished his shield with a *qǔrán* (扢然) vigor. **Zigong** exclaimed:
*"I do not know how high the heavens are, nor how deep the earth!"*

**【Citation】**
*SXuērán*—the sound of plucking the *qin*.
*Qǔrán*—a display of vigorous action.
This marks the mutual enlightenment of teacher and disciple, their shared joy.

**【Exegesis】**
*SXuērán*—as written. **Li Yun** says: *"The sound of plucking the *qin*."* Also written as *"shāo"* (梢), pronounced *xiāo* (消). ◎ **Lu Wenbian** notes: *"The Song edition reads 'shāo' as 'qiào' (俏)."*
*Qǔ*—pronounced *qì* (讫) or *jù* (巨), *yǔ* (鱼). **Li Yun** says: *"A display of vigorous dancing."* **Sima** says: *"A display of joy."* *Dryan*—a shield. Those who attained the **Dao** in antiquity found joy in adversity and in prosperity. Their joy was not in adversity or prosperity itself, but in **virtue/power** (德) manifesting here—then adversity and prosperity were but the sequence of cold, heat, wind, and rain.

**【Citation】**
*"Also joy"* (亦乐) pronounced *luò* (洛), same below. ◎ **Yu Yü** remarks: *"De"* (德) should be *"dé"* (得). The *Lǚlǜ* (*Palm Springs Annals*) *Shènrén* ("Cautious Person") reads *"Dao obtained here"* (道得于此), then adversity and prosperity are one, like the sequence of cold, heat, wind, and rain. It is likely that *"one"* (一) was omitted after *"adversity and prosperity"* (穷通) in this passage.

**【Citation】**
Thus, **Yuyu** found contentment at **Yeyang**, while **Gongbo** found fulfillment at **Gongshou**. **【Citation】**
The four seasons of yin, yang, heaven, and earth bring cold and warmth. How could mortals dwell within them without experiencing adversity or prosperity? Thus, those who attained the **Dao** found joy in adversity and prosperity, like the inevitability of wind and rain—what cause for concern?

**【Exegesis】**
*Yú at Yeyang*—*Guangya* (*Broad Explanations*) defines *"yú"* (虞) as *"ān"* (安), meaning *"at ease in Yeyang."* One variant reads *"yú"* (娱), meaning *"to rejoice."* *Gongbo*—pronounced *gōng* (恭), same below. *"Obtained at Gongshou"* (得乎共首)—**Sima** says: *"Gongbo’s given name was He, virtuous in conduct and fond of worthy men. When the calamity of King Li of Zhou occurred, the throne was vacant, and the feudal lords sought to enthrone Gongbo. He declined, but unable to refuse, he ascended the throne. In the fourteenth year, a great drought ignited roofs, and divination at Taiyang revealed: ‘King Li is the omen.’ Thus, Chou Gong deposed Gongbo and installed King Xuan. Gongbo returned to his ancestral domain, wandering content at the peak of Gongshou Mountain. Gongshou Mountain is now in Hezhong (River Interior)."* **Lu Lianzi** says: *"After Gongbo returned to his state, he found fulfillment at the peak of Gongshou Mountain."* *Jìnián* (*Chronicle of Years*) states: *"Gongbo He ascended the throne."* **Meng Kang** annotated the *Han Records* (*Gujin Renbiao* "Ancient and Modern Biographies"), claiming he served as a *san gong* (三公). The text was originally *"qiūshou"* (丘首). ◎ **Lu Wenbian** notes: *"The modern Shu text reads ‘sheltering the throne’s affairs’"* (摄行天子事). ◎ **Qing Fan** cross-references *Lushi Fahu* (*Historical Records Expansion*), citing **Sima** as saying: *"Gongbo He cultivated virtue and valued worthy men. When King Li’s calamity occurred, the throne was vacant, and the feudal lords, knowing Gongbo’s virtue, sought to enthrone him. He declined, unable to refuse, and thus ascended. In the fourteenth year, a great drought ignited roofs, and divination at Taiyang revealed: ‘King Li is the omen.’ Chou Gong then installed King Xuan. Gongbo returned to his ancestral domain, wandering content at the peak of Gongshou Mountain."* This slightly differs from the **Exegesis**. ◎ **Fan** further notes that the **Exegesis**, citing **Sima**, states Gongbo wandered content at the peak of Gongshou Mountain, yet does not specify its location, suspecting *"Gongshou"* (共首) may be *"Gongtou"* (共头). In the *Xunzi* (*Master Xun*), *"Until Gongtou, where the mountain tunnel lies"* (至共头而山隧), **Yang Shao** annotates: *"Gong is the name of a county in Hezhong; Gongtou is the name of the mountain in Gong County."* **Lu** says: *"Gongtou is the same as Zhuangzi’s Gongshou."* The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (*Palm Springs Annals*) *Chénglián* ("Sincere and Frugal") also reads *"Gongtou."* Here, *"shou"* (首) is likely a mistake for *"tou"* (头). (*"Tou"* and *"shou"* share the radical *"ye"* (页), which is also the radical for *"shou"* (首). In antiquity, *"tou"* and *"shou"* were interchangeable.*)

**【Collation】**
(1) Gao Shan Temple edition reads *"dé"* (得) instead of *"dé"* (德).

Shun yielded the Mandate of Heaven to his friend, the Northern man Wuze (無择), who said: *"How strange is this later ruler! He dwells in the fields of plow and furrow yet seeks to enter Yao’s court! Not only does he wish to surpass me, but he also intends to stain me with his shameful conduct. I am ashamed to see him."*

Thereupon, Wuze cast himself into the clear and cold abyss of Qingling (清泠之渊).**[1]**

**[1] Annotation:** Confucius said: *"A gentleman who aspires to virtue (仁) may even sacrifice his life to fulfill it, but he must not seek life at the expense of virtue. Those who uphold lofty ideals, transcending the common world, and those who sink into greed, losing their very souls—it is for such that Heaven and Earth send their judgments."*

**[Exegesis:] The Northern man, named Wuze (無择), was a friend of Shun. "Hou" (后) refers to Shun as a ruler. "Lǒng" (垄) denotes the raised furrows, while "gōng" (畎) denotes the lower furrows, together forming the term for plowed fields. The abyss of Qingling (清泠渊) lies within the borders of Xīyǎn County (西崿), in Nanyang (南阳).

Shun tilled the fields at Lìshān (历山), grew up among the furrows and plows, and frequented Yao’s court. When Yao abdicated in his favor, his deeds were surely as such? Yet he sought to defile me with his dishonorable conduct. Out of shame and humiliation, Wuze thus cast himself into the abyss of Qingling.*"*

When **Tang of Shang** plotted to overthrow **Jie of Xia**, he first consulted **Biàn Suí**, who replied: "This is not my affair."
Tang asked: "Who, then, may be trusted?"
Biàn Suí answered: "I do not know."

Tang knew of their virtue and consulted them for counsel. Since it was not the duty of recluses, they replied with ignorance. **Yī Yǎn** (伊尹), surname Yī, name Yǎn, with the courtesy name **Zì** (贽), was a sage aiding the age. *Mù* (忍) means to endure; *gòu* (垢) means humiliation.

I was born in a chaotic age, and men without the **Dao/Way** (无道之人) twice defiled me with their shameful deeds—I cannot bear to hear of them again."*

Mùguāng declined, saying:
*"To abandon one’s sovereign is not righteous; to slaughter the people is not virtuous; for others to face peril while I reap the benefits—this is not integrity. I have heard it said: ‘What is not righteous, one does not accept its emoluments; in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its soil. How much more so to be honored by you!’ I cannot bear to remain long."*

He then took up a stone and drowned himself in **Lú Water**.

**[1] Exegesis:**
*"Enjoy"* means *"accept."* *"Abandon one’s sovereign"* refers to deposing Jié (桀). *"Slaughter the people"* refers to warfare.

**[2] Annotation:**
An old saying claims: *"Those like Biān Suí and Mùguāng viewed the world as beyond the six directions—something no one could fathom. This is erroneous. One who scorns the world cannot hold anything dear; if nothing is held dear, there is no place of death. To see the world as beyond the six directions means it should be entrusted only to Yáo, Shùn, Táng, and Wǔ. Detached and indifferent, they drift with the multitude, indifferent to gain or loss—why then would they cast themselves away? Such as these two may be revered for their devotion to principle and high ideals, but they cannot be said to have withdrawn from the world."*

In the rise of the **Zhōu**, there were two worthies dwelling in **Gūzhú**, named **Bóyí** and **Shūqí**. The two spoke to each other:
*"We have heard that in the west there is one who seems to embody the Dao—let us go and observe him."*

When they reached **Qíyáng**, Wǔ Wáng heard of them and sent **Shūdàn** to meet them, swearing an oath:
*"I will grant you two ranks of wealth and one level of office."*

They slaughtered a sacrificial beast, buried the oath, and swore blood-brotherhood.

**[1] Exegesis:**
**Gūzhú** was a state in Liáo West. **Bóyí** and **Shūqí**, brothers who declined the throne, heard of Wén Wáng’s virtue and thus went to observe him. Their deeds have already been explained in the *Wàipiān*.

**[2] Exegesis:**
**Qíyáng** is the southern slope of **Qí Mountain**, the site where Wén Wáng established his capital—now Fúfēng. **Zhōugōng** was named **Dàn**, the younger brother of Wǔ Wáng, hence *"Shūdàn."* At that time, Wén Wáng had already passed away, and Wǔ Wáng ascended the throne, preparing to attack Jiè. To soothe and win over the virtuous, he had Zhōugōng swear an oath with them, granting them two levels of wealth and one rank of office. They then slaughtered a beast, anointed the oath with its blood, and buried it beneath the altar.

The two looked at each other and laughed:
*"Ah! How strange! This is not what we call the Dao."*

In ancient times, when Shénnóng held sway over the realm, his sacrifices were rendered with utmost reverence yet without supplication for favor; in his dealings with people, he governed with absolute loyalty and sincerity yet demanded nothing in return.

He governed through harmony and order, and ruled through harmony and governance—never using others’ flaws to establish his own virtue, nor their lowliness to elevate himself, nor seizing opportunities to profit from circumstances.

Now, the Zhou see the chaos of Yin and hastily institute governance. They plot above and act below through bribery, obstruct with arms to preserve their power, slaughter beasts and swear oaths to pledge their word, flaunt their deeds to sway the masses, and wage war to secure gain—this is but to perpetuate disorder in exchange for tyranny.

I have heard that ancient worthies, in times of order, did not shirk their duties, and in times of chaos, did not cling to mere survival. Now the world is in darkness, and the virtue of Yin is decaying. If they were to unite against the Zhou and destroy me, it would be better to withdraw and preserve my integrity.

The two men then traveled north to the Shǒuyáng Mountains, where they starved to death.

Men like Bǒyí and Chǔqí, when it came to wealth and honor, if they could avoid them, they would never rely upon them. With lofty principles and unyielding conduct, they took joy only in their own resolve, serving no worldly purpose—such was the resolve of these two worthies.

Joy is fortune. In the age of Shénnóng, simplicity and sincerity remained unspoiled, and the seasonal sacrifices were conducted with utmost reverence. The common folk were loyal, trustworthy, and diligent in their duties, yet they sought nothing beyond their proper course.

The ruler governed in harmony with the natural order, and the people followed their innate inclinations. Yet even so, they never wished misfortune upon others as their own gain, nor did they covet others’ dangers as their own advantage.

Swift in governance, the tyrant’s cruelty became manifest. He plotted strategies and distributed wealth to bolster his military might, employed persuasive rhetoric to sway the masses, and openly flaunted his schemes—thus perpetuating the Zhou’s chaos to replace the excesses of the Yin.

The *Analects* states: *"Bǒyí and Chǔqí starved beneath Shǒuyáng’s slopes, yet their death was not spoken of."* Yet here it says they died there, making clear their resolve to endure hunger until the end—not necessarily that they perished from it. The essence of this passage lies in fostering a spirit of noble retreat and refusal of worldly advancement. Thus, even those of greedy ambition, though they traverse the royal highways and enter the imperial courts, may still pause mid-journey in sighing reflection. How much more so the ordinary man!

Men like Bǒyí and Yǔxù were worthy to stand alongside Yù and Kè, to rival Yī and Lǔ. Those who dwell in seclusion yet broaden the Way for all—though they may not all become sagely ministers—are surely elevated above those mired in dust and squalor. Their deeds may be difficult to emulate, yet their influence endures with little corruption, and thus their legacy may be preserved.

*"What then are the flaws of Bǒyí and Yǔxù?"*
Yǔxù’s flaw was that his feigned refusal of office encouraged others to adorn their own rejections for personal gain, leading to the likes of Zhī Kuài’s hypocrisy. Bǒyí’s influence, however, allowed tyrannical rulers to unleash their cruelty unchecked, as none dared oppose them. The flaws of Yī and Lǔ were that they emboldened the ambitious and greedy to seize power through treachery. Only the Sage leaves no trace, and thus no flaw.

If Yī and Lǔ are taken as the Sage’s legacy, then Bǒyí and Chǔqí must also be so. If, however, Bǒyí and Chǔqí are not the Sage’s legacy, then neither are the deeds of Yī and Lǔ. The Sage follows the natural course of things, leaving no imposed pattern. Thus, what we call "Sage" is merely the name given to one who leaves no trace.

*"Tú"* means defilement. If they had remained alongside the Zhou, they feared their virtue would be sullied, so they withdrew and starved upon Shǒuyáng’s slopes. Shǒuyáng Mountain lies south of Pǔ Prefecture, near the river.

**Zhuózhí (Thief-Zhí) [Twenty-Ninth]**
This chapter takes its name from a person. Confucius was friends with Liúxià Jì, whose brother was named Zhuó Zhí. With an army of nine thousand men, Zhuó Zhí rampaged across the land, plundering the feudal lords, breaking into fortified homes, driving off cattle and horses, seizing women, and hoarding wealth until he forgot his own kin—neither honoring his parents nor his ancestors. Wherever he passed, great cities fortified their walls, and small towns took refuge within. The people suffered greatly.

**[Chapter Twenty-Ninth: Thief-Zhí]**

**Commentary:**
Surname Zhǎn (展), given name Qín (禽), courtesy name Jì (季), with the fief of Liǔxià (柳下) as his title—thus called Liǔxià Jì. Some say he dwelt beneath willow trees, hence his appellation. Zhǎn Qín lived during the reign of Duke Zhuāng of Lǔ (鲁庄公), roughly a century before Confucius. The mention of "friend" is likely metaphorical. Zhí (跖) was the name of Zhǎn’s brother, a notorious bandit, hence "Thief-Zhí."

He would **pierce holes in dwellings** and **unfasten door hinges**, seizing others’ cattle and horses. Some manuscripts read "空" (empty) or "驱" (drive) instead. *Bǎo* (保) refers to small fortified towns. His depredations were so vast that the common folk **suffered greatly** from them.

**Collation Notes:**
(《释文》) In *"Confucius and Liǔxià Jì as Friends"*, Liǔxià Huì (柳下惠) is surnamed Zhǎn (展), given name Huò (获), courtesy name Jì Qín (季禽). Some say his courtesy name was Zǐ Qín (子禽), and that he resided in Liǔxià while bestowing virtue and benevolence. Others claim *Huì* (惠) was his posthumous title, or that Liǔxià was the name of his fief. According to the *Zuòzhuan* (左传), Zhǎn Qín was a man of Duke Lǐ of Lǔ (鲁僖公), living **over eighty years before Confucius**, and if counted until Zǐlù’s death (子路之死), **over a century and a half**—thus, the term "friend" is metaphorical.

*Zhí* (跖) is read with the *shǐ* (石) radical. Lǐ Qí (李奇) annotated the *Hànshū* (汉书), stating that Zhí was a great bandit of the state of Qín (秦). **Yú Yì** (俞樾) notes that the *Zhèngyì* (正义) of the *Shǐjì* (史记) *Bóyí Transcription* (伯夷传) also claims Zhí was a great bandit of the Yellow Emperor’s time. The exact era of Zhí remains undetermined. Confucius did not contemporaneously know Liǔxià Huì, nor did Liǔxià Huì know Thief-Zhí; readers should not take this as literal history.

*"From"* (从) is pronounced *cóng* (才用反).
*"Coercive force"* (卒) is pronounced *zú* (尊忽反).
Below follows the same pronunciation.

*"Hinged doors"* (枢户) is pronounced *shūhù* (尺朱反), *kǔgōu* (徐苦沟反).
Sīmǎ (司马) explains: "To break into others’ homes by unfastening their door hinges and seizing their goods."

*Rú* (入) *bǎo* (保) is annotated in the *Lǐjì* (礼记) by Zhèng (郑): "Small fortified towns are called *bǎo*."

**Textual Correction:**
(一) The erroneous manuscript mistakenly cites Liú Dé (刘得) as reading *gōu* (枢) instead of *kǎo* (抠).

Confucius said to Liǔxià Jì:
*"As a man’s father, he must command his son;
as a man’s elder brother, he must instruct his younger brother.
If a father cannot command his son,
or an elder brother cannot instruct his younger brother,
then the bonds of father-son and brotherly love are lost.
Now, Master, you are a man of talent in the world—
yet your younger brother is Thief-Zhí,
a scourge to all under heaven,
and you cannot instruct him.
I, Zǐ (丘), am ashamed for you.
I beg to go and persuade him on your behalf."*

Liǔxià Jì replied:
*"Master says that as a man’s father he must command his son,
and as a man’s elder brother he must instruct his younger brother.
But if a son does not obey his father’s command,
or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s instruction,
even if you, Master, were to employ your eloquence,
what could you do to **subdue him**?
Moreover, Zhí’s nature is like a **gushing spring**—
his thoughts like a **whirling wind**,
his strength sufficient to **repel enemies**,
his words sufficient to **adorn wrongdoing**.
To act in accordance with his desires brings joy;
to oppose his desires brings wrath.
He is easily **provoked by words**.
Master, you must not go."*

Confucius refused to heed the warning, and Yán Huí drove the carriage while Zǐgōng sat at his right. They went to see Zhí.

Zhí was just then resting his soldiers on the southern slope of Dàshān, slicing men’s livers to eat raw. When Confucius stepped down from his carriage and approached, he addressed the attendant:

*"A man from Lǔ, Kǒng Qiū, has heard of your noble virtue and respectfully bows twice to announce himself."*

Zǐgōng rode beside him in the carriage.

The attendant led them in, and when Zhí heard of their arrival, he flew into a rage. His eyes blazed like stars, his hair bristled beneath his cap, and he shouted:

*"Is this not that cunning deceiver from Lǔ, Kǒng Qiū? Tell him this: ‘You fabricate words and contrive speeches, falsely invoking the names of Wǔ and Wǔ【一】. You wear a cap of twisted wood, gird yourself with the flank of a dead ox, spout empty rhetoric, eat without tilling, clothe yourself without weaving, wagging your lips and beating your tongue to stir up strife—you mislead the rulers of the world, causing scholars to abandon their roots and blindly chase titles and wealth under the pretense of filial piety and fraternal duty【三】. Your crimes are grave and extreme—be gone at once! Otherwise, I shall add your liver to my daily meal!’"*

*"【One】【Commentary】* The Sage Confucius followed the constitutional models of Wǔ and Wǔ【一】, tracing his lineage to Yáo and Shùn, refining rites and music, and leaving his legacy for posterity.

*【Two】【Commentary】* *‘*胁*’* means *‘*rib*’*—the cap worn by the Master bore elaborate, ornate decorations, its leaves dense and flourishing like branches of a tree. Moreover, he used oxhide for his belt, broad and sturdy, resembling the ribs of an ox.

*【Explanation of Text】* *‘*冠*’* is read with an ancient reversed tone. *‘*枝木之冠*’* is read as-is. Sīmǎ [司马] says: ‘The cap is adorned with extravagant embellishments, like the branching of a tree.’ *‘*带死牛之胁*’* is pronounced *jié* [劫]. Sīmǎ says: ‘He took oxhide to make a wide, thick belt.’

*【Three】【Commentary】* *‘*儌幸*’* means *‘*to hope in vain*’*—to feign filial piety and fraternal duty while secretly aspiring to titles and wealth. Thus, though he repeatedly sought office, he was mocked by Jiēyú with *‘*Fèng fèng*’* [凤兮]; abandoning his roots and lingering in superficial pursuits, he earned the scorn of Zhī Jīn’s *‘*chúgǒu*’* [刍狗] reproach."

「【Explanation of Text】 *Móushuō* is pronounced *miù*. *Xiàodì* is pronounced *tì*. The original also reads *tì* [悌].
*Ér miù* is pronounced with the ancient *Yáo* tone. ◎Yú Yì says: *ji* [极] should be *zhì* [殛]. The *Er Yá* ["Explanations of Words"] states: *zhì* means *zhū* [诛, "to punish"]. It refers to a grave crime deserving severe punishment. *Ji* and *zhì* were anciently interchangeable. In the *Shū* ["Classic of Documents"], the *Hóngfàn* ["Flood Control"] chapter states *Gǔn zé zhì sǐ* ["Gun was punished and put to death"], the *Duōshì* ["Many Ministers"] chapter states *dàfá zhì zhī* ["great punishment was inflicted upon him"], in the *Lǐzhēng* ["Spring and Autumn Annals"] *Lǐ* 28th year, it says *míng shén zhì zhī* ["the divine punishment was clear"], and in the *Zhāo* 7th year, the *Zhuàn* ["Commentary"] states *xī Yáo zhì Gǔn yú Yǔshān* ["Emperor Yao punished Gun at Yǔ Mountain"]. The *Shìwén* ["Explanations"] all say: *zhì* was originally *ji* [极].

Confucius replied to *Fùtōng* ["Complex Communication"]: *“Chóu dé xìng yú Jì, yuàn wàng lǚ mù xià.”* ["I have been fortunate to associate with my elder brother, wishing only to gaze upon his footsteps beneath the curtain."]

【Commentary】
He speaks of his fortune in associating with his virtuous elder brother, yet dared not look upon his face directly—only wishing to observe his footsteps beneath the curtain. Some versions read *qí* [綦] instead. *Qí* means "footprints," so "wishing to follow his footsteps" is akin to "looking at his feet."

【Explanation of Text】
*Fùtōng* is pronounced *fúyòu* [扶又], the same below. *Yuàn wàng lǚ mù xià* ["wishing to gaze upon his footsteps beneath the curtain"]—Sīmǎ’s [司马] text reads *qí* [綦] for *mù* ["curtain"], saying: "He dared not look upon the sole of his foot, only gazing at the laces and turning away."

Confucius hurried forward and advanced, then stepped back and withdrew, twice bowing before **Zhizi** the Bandit.

**Zhizi** the Bandit flew into a great rage, stretching out both his feet, gripping his sword, and glaring with eyes like a snarling tiger, he roared: *“Chou, come forward! If what you say pleases my will, you shall live; if it displeases my heart, you shall die.”*

Confucius said: *“Chou, I have heard that there are three kinds of **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) in the world: to be born and grow tall, beautiful and peerless, such that the young and old, noble and humble, all take pleasure in seeing you—this is the highest **virtue/power** (*shàngdé* 上德); to understand the **Dao/Way** (*wéi* 维) of Heaven and Earth, and to be able to distinguish among all things—this is the middle **virtue/power** (*zhōngdé* 中德); to be bold and resolute, gathering the people and leading armies—this is the lowest **virtue/power** (*xiàdé* 下德). For a person to possess even one of these three **virtues/power** (*dé* 德), he is sufficient to rule the south and claim sovereignty. Now, General, you possess all three of these **virtues/power** (*dé* 德): your stature is eight *chǐ* [尺] two *cùn* [寸] tall, your face and eyes radiant, your lips like red cinnabar, your teeth like polished seashells, and your voice harmonizes with the yellow bell. Yet you are known as **Zhizi** the Bandit—Chou privately feels shame for you and does not accept this name. If the General has the intention of listening to me, I request to dispatch envoys south to **Wu** and **Yue**, north to **Qi** and **Lu**, east to **Song** and **Wei**, and west to **Jin** and **Chu**. I will have them construct for the General a great walled city hundreds of *lǐ* [里] in circumference, establish towns with tens of thousands of households, and elevate the General as a **sovereign** (*zhūhóu* 诸侯). Together with the world, we will begin anew, disband the armies, and rest the soldiers. We will gather and nourish our brothers and younger siblings, and together honor our ancestors. This is the conduct of **sages** (*shèngrén* 圣人) and **talented scholars** (*cáishì* 才士), and the wish of the world.”*

「【One】【Commentary】 *Jī* (激) means "bright" or "illustrious." *Bèi* (贝) refers to "pearls." *Huángzhōng* (黄钟) is the name of one of the six *lǜ* (律) pitches in the ancient Chinese musical system.

The Bandit—Chou is deeply ashamed for you and does not accept this name. If the General truly possesses these three qualities—your stature of eight *chǐ* (尺) and two *cùn* (寸), your radiant visage, your lips like vermilion, your teeth like pearls, and your voice resonating with the pitch of *Huángzhōng*—yet bears the name "Bandit—Chou," then I, Chou, am ashamed and refuse to acknowledge it.

The General, if you have the intention of listening to me, I request to dispatch envoys south to **Wu** and **Yue**, north to **Qi** and **Lu**, east to **Song** and **Wei**, and west to **Jin** and **Chu**. I will have them construct for the General a great walled city hundreds of *lǐ* [里] in circumference, establish towns with tens of thousands of households, and elevate the General as a **sovereign** (*zhūhóu* 诸侯).

**The Bandit—Chou** roared in fury: "Come here, Chou! Those who can be swayed by profit and admonished with words are nothing but the foolish and common people! Now, my great stature and fine appearance, which others see and delight in, are the virtues bestowed by my parents. Even if you, Chou, do not praise me, can I not know myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter others to their face often slander them behind their backs. Now you speak to me of great cities and countless people—this is to sway me with profit, as if the common people would raise me to endure forever! How can such a thing last long? The greatest cities are those that encompass the entire world. **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun** ruled the world, yet their descendants had not even a place to insert a needle; **King Tang** and **King Wu** established themselves as **sovereigns** (*tiānzǐ* 天子), yet their posterity perished utterly. Is this not because their gains were too great?【One】【Commentary】 Speaking of great cities and countless people, implying that such prosperity cannot last long.

【Commentary】 The descendants of Yao and Shun were deprived of the throne because Yao passed it to Shun instead of his own son, **Dan Zhu** (丹朱), and Shun, in turn, passed it to **Yu** (禹), leaving no heir in the **Xia** (夏) and **Shang** (商) lineages.

【Commentary】 The descendants of the **Shang Dynasty** (商) and **Zhou Dynasty** (周) rulers, **King Tang** (汤) and **King Wu** (武), though they once held supreme authority, later faced usurpation and assassination. Is this not the consequence of the heavy burden of **prosperity** (*lì* 利) upon the **Four Seas** (四海) bringing about their downfall?

Furthermore, I have heard that in ancient times, wild beasts were numerous while humans were few. Thus, people lived in tree nests to avoid them, gathering acorns and chestnuts by day and resting in the trees by night. Hence, they were called **"Youchao’s people"** (*yǒuchāo* 有巢氏之民). In those days, people did not know clothing, so in summer they piled firewood, and in winter they burned it. Hence, they were called **"Zhisheng’s people"** (*zhīshēng* 知生之民). In the era of **Shennong** (神农), when people lay down they did so in comfort, and when they rose they were contented【One】, knowing only their mothers, not their fathers, living alongside deer and elk, tilling the land for food and weaving for clothing, without any intent to harm one another. This was the peak of **virtue** (*dé* 德).

Yet, **Huangdi** (黄帝) could not uphold **virtue** (*dé* 德), and fought against **Xiyu** (蚩尤) in the wilds of **Zhuolu** (涿鹿), spilling blood for a hundred *lǐ* [里]. **Yao** and **Shun** appointed ministers【Three】, **Tang** overthrew his ruler【Four】, and **King Wu** killed **King Zhou** (纣).【Five】 From that point onward, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many tyrannized the few. Since **Tang** and **Wu**, all have been disruptors of the people.【Six】」

「【One】【Commentary】 *Jūjū* (居居), the bearing of tranquility. *Yúyú* (于于), the appearance of self-contentment. 【Exegesis】 *Yú* (于) as in *Shāng* (橡), pronounced like *xiàng* (象). *Yú* (于) as in *Yáng* (炀), pronounced *yángliàng* (羊亮反).
◎ *Qìng Fān* notes that *yúyú* conveys vastness. In *Fāngyán* (方言), *yú* means "great."
In the *Rites of King Wén’s Heir*, where it says, *"Yú yú at his own person to better his lord,"* Zheng Xuan’s commentary reads: *"Yú is read as yú (迂),"* meaning expansive, vast.
In *Tán Gōng* (檀弓), *"Yú yú"* is explained in the *Zhèngyì* (正义) as also training *yú* in vastness. *Yúyú* is a reduplication.

【Two】【Commentary】 *Zhì* (至), meaning to attain. *Xīyú* (蚩尤), a feudal lord. *Zhuólù* (涿鹿), a place name—today’s *Yōuzhōu* (幽州) *Zhuó Commandery* (涿郡). *Xīyú* invented the Five Weapons and fought *Huángdì*, thus spilling blood for a hundred *lǐ*.
【Exegesis】 *Xīyú*, a feudal lord in *Shénnóng’s* era, the first to forge weapons. *Shénnóng’s* eighth successor was *Yúwàng* (榆罔). In *Xīyú’s* time, his clan grew strong, and he contested kingship with *Yúwàng*, driving him out. *Yúwàng* allied with *Huángdì* to slay *Xīyú*.
The *Hànshū Yīnyì* (汉书音义) states: *"Xīyú was an ancient sovereign."* Another account says: *"A greedy commoner."* *Zhuólù* (涿鹿), pronounced *zhuó* (卓). Also written as *Zhuó* (浊).

Why does the world not call you *Thief Qiú* (盗丘), yet brands me as *Thief Zhí* (盗跖)?

【One】【Commentary】 *Kǒngzǐ* modeled himself on *Wén* and *Wǔ*, elucidating *rén* (仁) and *yì* (义) as doctrine for posterity.

You, with sweet words, persuaded *Zǐlú* (子路) to follow you, urging him to remove his tall crown and unsheathe his long sword to receive your teaching—yet the world declares *Kǒng Qiū* (孔丘) could curb violence and forbid wrong.
But in the end, *Zǐlú* sought to kill the ruler of *Wèi* (卫), the deed failed, and he was flayed alive at *Wèi’s* eastern gate—proving your teaching fell short.

【One】【Commentary】 A tall, dangerous crown and a long sword were the garb of the bold. Having submitted to *Kǒng* (孔), he discarded them.

Do you claim to be a sage or a wise man?
Yet you were twice exiled from *Lǔ* (鲁), banished from *Wèi* (卫), impoverished in *Qí* (齐), besieged in *Chén-Cài* (陈蔡), finding no place in the world. You taught *Zǐlú* to suffer this fate—unable to protect himself or others—how noble is your **Way**?

The world holds *Huángdì* in highest regard, yet even he could not preserve **virtue** (*dé*), fighting at *Zhuólù* and spilling blood for a hundred *lǐ*.
*Yáo* was not filial,
*Shùn* was not pious,
*Yǔ* was one-sided and crippled,
*Tāng* exiled his lord,
*Wǔwáng* slew *Zhòu*,
*Wénwáng* was imprisoned at *Yǔlǐ* (羑里).
These six—whom the world extols—who examines them finds they were all seduced by self-interest, distorting truth and perverting nature. Their deeds are shameful indeed.

【One】【Commentary】 He refused to cede the throne to *Dānjú* (丹朱).

【Exegesis】 *"Wéi"* (以为), pronounced *yúwěi* (于伪反), same below.
*"Yáo bù cí"* (尧不慈): he did not pass the throne to his son.

【Two】【Commentary】 He was hated by his father.

「【Three】【Exegesis】 He labored tirelessly to tame the waters, enduring winds like combing one’s hair and rains like bathing, thus contracting the affliction of *piāncuì* (偏枯), rendering half his body paralyzed.

【Four】【Exegesis】 *Yǔlǐ* (羑里) is the name of a prison in the *Yīn* (殷) dynasty. *Wénwáng* (文王) endured the calamity of *Zhòu* (纣), confined in prison for seven years before finally being released.

【Exegesis】 *"Wénwáng jū yǔlǐ"* (文王拘羑里): In the *Zhòu* dynasty’s 20th year, *Zhòu* imprisoned *Wénwáng*.

【Five】【Exegesis】 The six "sages" refer to *Huángdì* (黄帝), *Yáo* (尧), *Shùn* (舜), *Yǔ* (禹), *Tāng* (汤), and *Wénwáng* (文王). All were seduced by the pursuit of *wànshèng* (万乘), thus losing their **Dao/Way** (*zhēndào* 真道) and forcibly defying nature (*zìrán* 自然). Hence, their conduct is truly shameful.

【Exegesis】 *"Ér qiǎng"* (而强): Pronounced *qǐqiǎng* (其强反).
*"Kěxiū"* (可羞): As written.
The original also reads *"kě'è"* (可恶), pronounced *wūlù* (乌路反).

【Correction】 (One) The *Jiāngnán Gǔzàng* (江南古藏) edition mistakenly cites six as seven.

The so-called **virtuous/accomplished men** (*xiánshì* 贤士) of the world are *Bòyī* (伯夷) and *Shúqí* (叔齐). *Bòyī* and *Shúqí* declined the throne of *Gūjǔ* (孤竹之君) and starved to death on *Shǒuyáng* (首阳) Mountain, their bones left unburied. *Bàojiāo* (鲍焦), by name, was a recluse of the *Zhōu* (周) era. He adorned his conduct with what was not of the world, carrying burdens while gathering firewood, and gathering acorns for food. Thus, he had no descendants, did not serve the Son of Heaven, nor befriend the feudal lords.

*Shēntú Dí* (申徒狄) remonstrated yet was not heeded, and so he took a stone and cast himself into the river, where he was eaten by fish. *Jièzǐ Tuī* (介子推) was supremely loyal, cutting off his own thigh to feed *Wén Gōng* (文公). Later, when *Wén Gōng* failed to acknowledge him, *Jièzǐ Tuī* grew angry and departed, perishing by fire while embracing a tree. *Wěishēng* (尾生) made an appointment with a woman beneath a bridge, but when she failed to come and the waters rose, he did not leave, and so died clinging to the bridge’s pillar.

These six **virtuous/accomplished men** (子者), no different from those who flay dogs or drive pigs to market while begging in broken pots, all abandoned reputation (*lì* 离) for a light death (*qīngsǐ* 轻死), unmindful of their own nurture and life span.

【One】【Exegesis】 The two died in poverty on *Shǒuyáng* Mountain, and no descendants buried them. *Bàojiāo* (鲍焦), whose surname is *Bào* (鲍), was a recluse of the *Zhōu* (周) era. He adorned his conduct with what was not of the world, maintaining strict integrity in his conduct. He carried burdens while gathering firewood, and collected acorns to fill his stomach. Thus, he had no descendants, did not serve the Son of Heaven, nor befriend the feudal lords. When *Zǐgòng* (子贡) encountered him, he said: "I have heard that one should not tread upon land whose government is not just, nor accept benefits from a ruler who is unworthy. Now you tread upon this land and accept its benefits—is this acceptable?" *Bàojiāo* replied: "I have heard that a **virtuous/accomplished man** (*liánshì* 廉士) values advancement while scornful of retreat, and the **wise** (*xiánrén* 贤人) feels shame easily but scorns death lightly." He then embraced a tree and stood until he withered away.

【Two】【Exegesis】 *Shēntú* (申徒) drowned himself; this has already been explained in the previous section. He remonstrated yet was not heeded, though it is unclear what his specific argument was. *Cuī Jiā* (崔嘉), though understanding, had no precise words of remonstrance.

【Exegesis】 *"Fù shí zì tóu yú hé"* (负石自投于河): *Shēntú Dí* (申徒狄) was about to cast himself into the river, when *Cuī Jiā* (崔嘉) stopped him, saying: "I have heard that a **sage** (*shèngrén* 圣人), a **virtuous/accomplished man** (*rénshì* 仁士), and a father of the people should not, even if their feet were wet, fail to rescue a drowning person—is this acceptable?" *Shēntú Dí* replied: "No. In ancient times, *Jié* (桀) killed *Lóngféng* (龙逢), and *Zhòu* (纣) killed *Bǐgān* (比干), and yet they lost their kingdoms;

「Wú killed Zǐxú, Chén killed Xiè Zhì, and yet their kingdoms were extinguished.
It was not that the sages were without virtue—it was because they were not employed.»

Thus, he drowned himself in the river and died.

【Three】【Exegesis】
Jìn Wén Gōng (晋文公, the Duke of Jin) was Wén Chǒu (重耳), who, fleeing the *Lì Jī* (骊姬) calamity, wandered to other states. Stricken by hunger along the way, he sliced his own thigh to feed his followers. Three days after his return, when he bestowed fiefs upon his retainers, he forgot Zǐtuī (子推). Zǐtuī composed the *Lóngshé* (龙蛇) ode, inscribed it upon his gate, and in fury fled. The Duke, ashamed and remorseful, pursued Zǐtuī to Jiè Shān (介山). Zǐtuī concealed himself, so the Duke set fire to the mountain, hoping he would emerge. When the flames reached him, Zǐtuī embraced a tree and burned to death.

【Release Text】
*"Yǐ shí"* (以食): pronounced *sì* (嗣).
*"Fán sǐ"* (燔死): pronounced *fán* (烦), meaning "to burn."

◎ *Qìng Fān* (庆藩) notes in the *Zuǒzhuan* (左传): "Jiè Zhītuī (介之推) spoke not of rewards, and rewards did not reach him." It further states: "The Duke of Jìn sought him but could not find him, so he granted him the fields of *Miánshàng* (绵上), saying: 'To mark my guilt and to honor the virtuous.'" The *Lǚshuō* (吕览) records: "Jiètuī carried a pot and a mat, unseen all his life." The *Shǐjì* (史记) states: "When messengers summoned him, he fled. It was heard that he had entered the mountains of *Miánshàng*, so the Duke enclosed those mountains and granted them as *Jiètuī Tián* (介推田), naming it *Jiè Shān* (介山). A thorough examination of the classics reveals no account of Jiètuī burning to death. The tale of *lìkū* (立枯) originated with *Qū Yú* (屈子) [(see *Chūyī Jiǔzhōu* (楚辞九章·惜往日): *Jiè Zǐtuī ér lìkū* (介子推而立枯兮))], while *Zhuāngzi* (庄生) introduced the account of burning death [(as noted in *Yóngzhāi Sānbǐ* (容斋三笔), which mistakenly attributes it to *Xīnxù* (新序), but this is incorrect)]. *Dōngfāng Shùo* (东方朔) in his *Qī Jiàn* (七谏) and the *Hànshū* (汉书) in the *Jǐng Jí* (丙吉) transmission all perpetuated this error. Now, we must correct it with the accounts from the *Zuǒzhuan* and *Lǚshuō*.」

「**Chapter Four: Commentary**

The Six Sons (六子) refer to **Bóyí** (伯夷), **Shūqí** (叔齐), **Báojiāo** (鲍焦), **Shēntú** (申徒), **Jiètuī** (介推), and **Wěishēng** (微生). These six men did not align with the **Dao/Way** (玄道), instead contorting their emotions and feigning conduct to stand out from common customs, thereby gaining fame and passing it down through the ages. What difference is there between them and **Zhāng Zhì** (张磔), who was flayed alive like a dog, drifting in water, or a destitute beggar carrying a gourd to beg for alms? Such trifling figures are not worthy of mention or hearing. The actions of these Six Sons are identical to these: all are those who value fame over life, neglecting to return to their roots and nurture their existence, failing to fulfill their natural lifespan. The character *豕* (shǐ) can also be read as *死* (sǐ), and *乞* (qǐ) can also be read as *走* (zǒu); *随* (suí) is read as above.

**Explanation of Text:**
The *Wěishēng* (微生) passage is also written as *Wěishēng* (尾生).
In the *Strategies of the Warring States* (战国策), **Wěishēng Gāo** (尾生高) is recorded, with **Gāo Yù** (高诱) identifying him as a man from **Lǔ** (鲁).
*磔* (zhì) is pronounced *Zhì* (竹客反).
The *Guǎngyǎ* (广雅) states: "To flay" (张).
*操* (cāo) is pronounced *Qiūcāo* (七曹反).
*瓢* (piáo) is pronounced *Píyáo* (婢遥反).
The phrase *而乞者* (ér qǐ zhě) is interpreted by **Lǐ** (李) as: "These four above did not meet their proper ends, just like pigs, dogs, and beggars wandering in ditches."
*乞* (qǐ) can also be written as *走* (zǒu).
*离名* (lín míng) is pronounced *Lìzhì* (力智反).
*本* (běn) can also be written as *卒* (zú).

**Corrections:**
(1) In the **Shìdé Táng** (世德堂) edition, the characters **Bóyí Shūqí** (伯夷叔齐) are not repeated.
(2) A missing character: *六* (liù) was mistakenly written as *四* (sì); the **Jiāngnán Gǔzàng** (江南古藏) edition states: *四* (sì) should be *六* (liù).
(3) A missing character: **Zhāng Jūnfáng** (张君房) edition has *利* (lì) instead of *离* (lí).

Among those called **loyal ministers** (忠臣) in the world, none surpass **Wángzǐ Bǐgān** (王子比干) and **Wǔzǐ Shū** (伍子胥).
**Wǔzǐ Shū** drowned in the river, **Bǐgān** had his heart carved out—these two are deemed loyal ministers by the world, yet they ultimately became the laughingstock of all under heaven.

**Chapter One: Commentary**
From the perspective of the **Dao/Way**, down to **Wǔzǐ Shū** and **Bǐgān**, none are truly worthy of veneration.

**Chapter One: Explanation of Text**
They are objects of scorn for those who follow the **Dao/Way**.

**Explanation of Text:**
*剖心* (pōu xīn) is pronounced *Pòkǒu* (普口反).

The reason **Qióng** (丘) speaks to me is this: if one tells me of matters concerning **ghosts** (鬼), I cannot understand them; but if one tells me of human affairs, they are no more than these examples—all of which I know and have heard. Now, I speak to you of human desires: the eyes wish to see colors, the ears wish to hear sounds, the mouth wishes to savor flavors, and the **spirit-qi** (志气) seeks fulfillment. Among humans, the upper limit of lifespan is a hundred years, the middle eighty, and the lower sixty. Subtracting the time lost to illness, emaciation, death, mourning, and suffering, the days one can truly open their mouth and laugh within a month are no more than four or five. The heavens and earth are boundless, yet human life is limited. With finite lives, we cling to boundless desires—suddenly, we are no different than **qílì** (骐骥), galloping past a narrow gap in an instant.

Those who cannot articulate their true intentions and cultivate their natural lifespan are not true **followers of the Dao/Way** (通道者).
All that **Qióng** (丘) has spoken of, I have rejected. Hurry away, return to your roots, and do not speak of such matters again!
Your **Dao/Way** (道) is a frantic, grasping, deceitful, and false affair—it cannot preserve the true self. Why should it be discussed at all?

**Chapter One: Commentary**
The eyes see, the ears hear, the mouth discerns flavors, and the **spirit-qi** (志气) seeks fulfillment—these are natural inclinations, given by **Nature** (造物). How could they be feigned? They are inherent to one’s being; the **Dao/Way** is embedded within them.

**Explanation of Text:**
*以说* (yǐ shuō) is pronounced *Yúshuō* (如字) or *Shǐruì* (始锐反).

**Chapter Two: Commentary**
The heavens endure long, the earth persists eternally—yet human life is fleeting, its limits pressing. With a finite body, we entrust ourselves to boundless desires—what difference is there from **qílì** (骐骥) galloping past a narrow crevice? The pronunciation *上寿* (shàng shòu) is read as *Shòushòu* (受) or as *Shàngshòu* (如字). The same applies below.»

**Translation:**

**《瘦》**—*sè* again reversed. ◎ **Master Wang Renshu** says: In the *Shìwén*, *shòu* (瘦) is pronounced *sè* again. I note that *shòu* should be *yǔ* (瘐), a scribal error. *Yǔ* also means *disease*. Diseases of wasting (*yǔ*) form one category, death and mourning another, and sorrow and affliction a third. The original character for *yǔ* was *yù* (愈). The *Ēryá* states: *"Yù* (愈), disease."* In the *Mao* transmission of the *Zhāngyǎ* *"Zhēngyuè"* (正月), *"Hú bǐ wǒ yù"* (胡俾我愈), the commentary aligns with the *Ēryá*. In the *Book of Han*, Emperor Xuandi’s annals record: *"Those condemned to death by flogging or imprisonment, if they die from hunger, cold, or wasting (*yǔ*) in prison,"* where **Sū Lín** explains: *"Yǔ* (瘐), disease—prisoners’ sickness, legally termed *yǔ*."* **Shī Gǔ** states: *"Yǔ* (瘐), pronounced *yǔ* (庾), sometimes written as *yù* (愈)."* The *Tablet of Prince Wáng Zǐhòu* reads: *"Fùhóu Lóng, imprisoned and dying from *yǔ* (庾)〔yǔ〕 (二)."*

**Chapter Three: Commentary**
*Jí* (亟), urgency. *Kuángkuáng* (狂狂), loss of nature. *Jiéjié* (伋伋), insufficiency. The **Dao/Way** of sages’ traces, the practice of **virtue** and righteousness—like that of **Sū Lú’s** hut or the sacrificial **chúdòu**—if clutched without release, only deepens their ruin. Madness (*kuángkuáng*) loses its truth, insufficiency (*jiéjié*) falls short—these hollow deceits, what merit do they hold for discussion?

**Phonetic Notes:**
- *Néngshuō* (能说) pronounced *yuè* (悦).
- *Jíqù* (亟去) pronounced *jílì* (纪力反), meaning *urgent*. Originally written as *jí* (极).
- *Wúfù* (无复) pronounced *fūyòu* (扶又反).
- *Kuángkuáng* (狂狂) as written, or *jiǔkuàng* (九况反).
- *Jíjí* (汲汲) also written as *jiéjié* (伋伋), pronounced *jí* (急) or *jí* (及).
- *Zhàqiǎo* (诈巧) pronounced *kǔxiào* (苦孝反), or as written.

**Collation Notes:**
(一) **Zhào Jiànyì’s** text reads *jiéjié* (伋伋).
(二) The character *yǔ* (瘐) follows the *Book of Han* correction.

Confucius bowed twice and hurried away, stepping out and mounting his carriage, where he grasped the reins three times in failure, his vision blurred as if seeing nothing, his face ashen like dead embers. Leaning against the handrail, head bowed, he could not catch his breath.

Upon reaching the eastern gate of Lu, he happened upon Gōuliú Xiàjì. Gōuliú Xiàjì said, *“You have been absent these past days, your carriage bearing signs of haste—have you gone to see Zhí the Robber by chance?”*

**Phonetic Notes:**
- *Shàngchē* (上车) pronounced *shǐzhǎng* (时掌反).
- *Sānshī* (三失) pronounced *xīzàn* (息暂反), or as written.
- *Mángrán* (芒然) pronounced *mògāng* (莫刚反).
- *Yǒuxíng* (有行) as written.

**Collation Notes:**
(一) **Zhào Jiànyì’s** text reads *rán* (然) [twice].

**Explanatory Notes:**
- *Shì* (轼): The horizontal bar at the front of a carriage, where one leans while seated.
- Zhí (跖): A legendary outlaw and bandit, renowned for his boldness and debates on *wùlǐ* (物理—principles of nature/human affairs).
- *Wéi* (微): Here, meaning "without" or "in secret."

Gōuliú Xiàjì added, *“Has Zhí perhaps gone against your will as before?”*

Confucius replied, *“Indeed.”*

Confucius sighed to the heavens and said, *“This is like one who, without ailment, sears himself with cauterization—racing to prod a tiger’s head and braid its whiskers, nearly falling prey to its jaws!*”

---
**Collation Notes:**
(一) The phrase *“as before”* refers to the opening of this chapter where Gōuliú Xiàjì says: *“To defy one’s will is to provoke anger—would it not be as if I spoke against your intentions as I did before?”* Confucius replied: *“Indeed, as you said.”*

(二) **Explanatory Note:**
This passage illustrates the principle that when acting in accordance with the desires of the multitude, even a tyrant like King Zhòu may be removed; yet without aligning with the people, even a bandit like Zhí cannot be governed. The metaphor of probing a tiger’s head and braiding its whiskers—nearly falling into its jaws—mirrors Confucius’ perilous journey to persuade Zhí, risking danger akin to this folly. The chapter’s intent is to disparage the pursuit of saintly deeds and scorn the pursuit of fame and gain, hence its critique of Yáo and Shùn while belittling Yí and Qí. The analogy of Confucius and Zhí serves this satirical purpose. Guō Xiàng’s interpretation, however, errs in its distance.

**Phonetic Notes:**
- *Zìjiǔ* (自灸) pronounced *jiǔyòu* (久又反).
- *Jízǒu liào* (疾走料) pronounced *liáo*.
- *Biānhǔ* (扁虎) pronounced *biānhǔ* (音鞭), or *púxiǎn* (蒲显反), *xúfúxiǎn* (徐扶显反). Some manuscripts read *biāntóu biānhǔxū* (编头编虎须), with *biān* (编) homophonous to *liào* (料).

Zǐzhāng asked Mǎn Gǔdé, *“Why not simply act?* Without action, one is not trusted; without trust, one is not entrusted; without entrustment, one gains no advantage. Thus, observing reputation and calculating profit, virtue is truly the path to follow. But if one abandons fame and gain, turning against one’s own nature, then the scholar’s pursuit of action cannot be for even a single day!”

---
**Collation Notes:**
(一) **Zǐzhāng**, a disciple of Confucius, bore the surname Zhuān Sūn, given name Shī, and the courtesy name Zǐzhāng—a man who followed the path of the sage. **Mǎn Gǔdé** is a fictitious name, implying one who satisfies his desires through greed and deceit. *“Swēi”* (盍) means *“why not.”* The passage urges him to abandon the pursuit of fame and gain.

---
Mǎn Gǔdé replied, *“The shameless grow rich; the overly trusting gain prominence. The greatest of fame and gain lie in shamelessness and trust. Thus, observing reputation and calculating profit, trust is truly the path to follow. But if one abandons fame and gain, turning against one’s own nature, then the scholar’s pursuit of action is but clinging to his innate purity!”*

---
**Collation Notes:**
(二) Without action in virtue, one is not trusted; without trust, one holds no office; without office, one gains no profit. Thus, action brings reputation, reputation brings profit—observing and calculating, virtue is truly the good deed worth pursuing.

(三) *“Fǎn”* (反) here means *“to defy.”* If one abandons fame and gain, it defies one’s nature; hence, the scholar’s conduct must never forsake virtue for even a day.

---
Zǐzhāng said, *“In the past, Jié and Zhòu, though noble as sons of Heaven and wealthy with all under Heaven, were now told to a thief: ‘Act as Jié and Zhòu did,’ and they would blush with shame, their hearts unwilling. Such is how the vulgar despise them. Zhōngní and Mò Dí, though reduced to commoners, were now told to an official: ‘Act as Zhōngní and Mò Dí did,’ and he would change his expression, praising their sufficiency. Truly, the noble are not defined by their station—whether as a son of Heaven or a commoner—but by the virtue or vice of their conduct.”*

---
**Collation Notes:**
(一) Jié, Zhòu, Zhōngní, and Mò Dí were discussed earlier. *“Zāng”* refers to Zāng Huò, and *“jù”* to theft—common rogues. Comparing a thief to a son of Heaven evokes shame and reluctance; comparing an official to a commoner elicits admiration and approval. Thus, nobility lies in conduct, not in rank.

---
Mǎn Gǔdé said, *“Small thieves are imprisoned, great thieves become lords; at the gates of lords, righteous men still dwell. In the past, Huan Gōng—Jiǎ Bái—killed his brother and wed his sister-in-law, yet Guān Zhòng served him. Tián Chéngzǐ—Jiāng Zhāng—murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Kǒngzǐ accepted his gifts. In speech, they are condemned; in deed, they are revered. This contradiction festers within the heart—is it not discordant?”*

The Classics thus say:
*"Who is vile, who is fair?
The successful are honored as leaders,
The unsuccessful are scorned as followers."*

---

**Commentary:**
*"Treacherous"* means *contrary*.
*"Discordant"* means *perverse*.

Huan Gong—named Xiao Bai—slaughtered his brother’s son, Ji You, and took his sister-in-law as wife. Guan Zhong, though a sage, served him as minister and ultimately achieved the unification of the feudal lords and the rectification of the world. Tian Chengzi Chang murdered his lord, Duke Jian of Qi, yet Confucius bathed and attended court to accept his gifts.

To murder a brother and wed his sister-in-law, to slay a sovereign and usurp the state—no greater depravity exists in human relations. Yet Yi Wu served as his minister, and Ru’s Master received his tribute. In speech, they are condemned as base; in deed, they are revered. Is this not a warring within the breast, a contradiction between words and actions?

---
**Exegesis:**
*"To take his sister-in-law"*—early readings vary.
*Sima* explains: *"To take her as a wife in the household."*
*"As minister"*—some texts read *"as prime minister."*
*"To murder his lord"*—reads *shān zhì* (申志).
*"In speech"*—reads *lì dùn* (力顿).
*"Contradiction"*—reads *bù zhàn* (布内).
*"Discordant"*—reads *yì fú* (扶弗).

---
**Commentary:**
*"The successful are honored as leaders"*—they become lords and are served.
*"The unsuccessful are scorned as followers"*—they are censured and defamed.
Thus, the text speaks only of success or failure—it does not concern morality or its absence. Who then knows where true virtue lies?

The cited text has since perished in the conflagration; no original remains.

Zi Zhang said:
*"If one does not uphold conduct,
Then kinship and distance lack order,
Nobility and lowliness lack principle,
Seniority and juniority lack sequence—
How then shall the Five Roots and Six Relationships be distinguished?"*

---
**Commentary:**
*"Kinship"* means *affinity*.
*"Order"* means *proper arrangement*.
The *Five Roots* refer to ancestors and descendants, or the Five Phases (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth), or the Five Virtues (Ren, Yi, Li, Zhi, Xin).
The *Six Relationships* refer to sovereign-subject, father-son, husband-wife, or parents, siblings, and spouses.

Zi Zhang said:
*"If one does not practice the Dao of Ren and Yi,
Then near and far lack proper arrangement,
Nobility and lowliness lack principle,
Seniority and juniority lack proper sequence—
Then how shall the Five Roots and Six Relationships be distinguished?"*

---
**Exegesis:**
*"Seniority"*—reads *dīng zhàng* (丁丈).

「The *Five Roots* [Sīmǎ’s commentary]: Year, day, month, stars, and celestial cycles.

The *Six Relationships*: Sovereign, minister, father, son, husband, and wife.

◎Yú Yì remarked: *"Sīmǎ’s commentary on the Five Roots as year, day, month, stars, and celestial cycles does not align with the meaning of near and far, noble and lowly, senior and junior. This is likely incorrect.*

Now, upon examination, the *Five Roots* are indeed the *Five Relationships* [Lún], and the *Six Relationships* are the *Six Roots* [Jì]. The *White Tiger’s Dialogue* [Bái Hǔ Tōng] in the chapter on *Three Halos and Six Roots* states: *"The Six Roots refer to uncles, brothers, kinsmen, maternal relatives, teachers and elders, and friends."* These are all the means by which distinctions of near and far, noble and lowly, senior and junior are made. Though it is not called the Five Relationships but the Five Roots, nor the Six Roots but the Six Relationships, this is merely the variation in ancient terminology.

In the *Family Sayings* [Jiā Yǔ], under the chapter *Entering the Officials*, the *Five Relationships* of servants are discussed. Wáng Shū’s annotation states: *"Relationships"* [Lún] are *"Roots"* [Jì]. Thus, *Relationships* and *Roots* can be used interchangeably.

*For distinction* [Wéi bié]—*bié* reads *bì* [彼列反].

The same below.

Mǎn Gǔdé said:
*"Did Yao kill his eldest son, Shun exile his younger brother, and thus establish distinctions of near and far? Did Tang exile Jié and King Wǔ kill Zhòu, and thus establish distinctions of noble and lowly? Did King Jì [Wáng Jì] act as the heir and the Duke of Zhōu kill his own brother, and thus establish proper sequence for seniority and juniority? If the Confucians falsify words and the Mohists advocate universal love, then how can the Five Roots and Six Relationships be distinguished?"*

【一】【Cōng】Yáo abandoned his eldest son Dān Zhū, not passing the throne to him (and) [therefore] [also] spoke of killing him. Shùn exiled his younger brother Xiàng to the state of Yǒuyú, commanding the officials of the realm to govern his territory, collect tribute, and levy taxes—hence the term *exile*. To abandon the heir and exile the younger brother, where is the principle of near and far?

【Shìwén】*"Yao killed his eldest son"*—Cuī [崔] reads: *"Yao killed his eldest son, Dān Zhū, as recorded in Kǎo Jiàn"* [考监明].
*"Shun exiled his younger brother"*—the younger brother refers to Xiàng. *Exile* [liú] means *banishment* [fàng]. Mèngzǐ states: *"Shun exiled Xiàng to Yǒuyú, preventing him from acting in his state. The Son of Heaven sent officials to govern his territory, and they collected tribute and levied taxes."* Hence, it is called *banishment*.

【二】【Cōng】Yīn Tāng banished Xià Jié to Náncháo, and Zhōu Wǔ killed Yīn Zhòu at Jì-jùn. How does this establish distinctions of sovereign-subject and noble-lowly?

【三】【Cōng】Wáng Jì, the younger brother of Zhōu Dà Wáng, was Jìlì [季历], the father of Wén Wáng. Tàibó and Zhòngyōng yielded the throne and did not ascend it, so the younger son Jìlì was made the heir. Guān and Cài, the elder brothers of Zhōu Gōng, wept and were slain—hence the phrase *"killed his brother"* [shā xiōng]. To abandon the rightful heir and establish the younger brother, and for a younger brother to slay his elder brother—how does this establish proper sequence for seniority and juniority?

【Shìwén】*"For heir"* [wéi shì] reads *dīnglì* [丁历反].

【四】【Cōng】The Confucians speak excessively, artificially creating distinctions of name and status; the Mohists advocate universal love, extending benevolence without discrimination. How can the Five Roots and Six Relationships then be distinguished?

*Though you uphold names as principle, and I uphold profit as principle. The substance of names and profit does not conform to reason, nor does it reflect the Dao/Way.*

I daily argue with you in the realm of *No Contract* [Wúyuē], saying:
*"The petty man pursues wealth, the noble man pursues prestige. The means by which they alter their emotions and change their nature differ; but when it comes to abandoning what they ought to do and pursuing what they ought not, they are the same."*

Hence, it is said:
*"Do not act as a petty man, and you will return to the Dao/Way; do not act as a noble man, and you will follow the natural principle of the Dao/Way.*

*Whether crooked or straight, they assist the Dao/Way to its utmost; facing all four directions, they harmonize with the rhythms of time.*

*Whether true or false, they grasp the Dao/Way’s subtle mechanism; standing alone yet complete in purpose, they wander with the Dao/Way.*

*Act without deviation, and you will not establish distinctions of virtue/power; you will lose what you ought to do.*

*Seek wealth without haste, and you will not achieve it; pursue prestige without abandon, and you will not attain it—you will abandon the Dao/Way itself."*

【一】【Cōng】*Reflect* [jiàn], means *illuminate* or *perceive*. Your heart’s inclination is fixed on prestige; my heart’s inclination is fixed on profit. Though prestige and profit diverge, both paths are not true substance—contradicting ultimate reason, how could they be clearly perceived in the profound Dao/Way?

【Shìwén】*"Though you uphold names"* [Qǐ zǐ zhèng wéi míng]—hypothetical speech. *For* [wéi] reads *yú* [于伪反]. The same below for *profit*.
*"Reflect"* [bù jiàn]—original text also reads *bù jiàn* [不鉴], same meaning.

【二】【Cōng】*Argue* [sòng] means *discourse* or *reason*. *Contract* [yuē] means *oath or agreement*. Abandoning what one ought to do means *forsaking oneself*; pursuing what one ought not means *chasing after external things*. To pursue profit is to be petty; to pursue prestige is to be noble. Though profit and prestige differ, the pursuit is the same. You and I, though differing in our inclinations, both speak of profound principles in the realm of *No Action* [Wúwéi], earnestly discussing the unspoken bond of mutual understanding.

【Shìwén】*"I daily"* [Wú rì]—*rì* reads *shí* [人实反].
*"No Contract"* [wú yuē]—*yuē* reads *yuē* [约], as in *agreement*.
*"Wander"* [pái huái]—*huái* reads *miào* [徘徊，于妙反].

【三】【Cōng】*You* [ér], means *thus*. Neither chasing after profit nor pursuing prestige, one can then follow nature’s root, aligning with the Dao/Way’s spontaneous principle.

【四】【Cōng】*Assist* [xiàng], means *aid*. Whether crooked or straight, one follows the Dao/Way’s natural course, observing all four directions and adjusting with the seasons’ ebb and flow.

【五】【Cōng】*Wander* [pái huái], means *to turn and vary one’s thoughts*. *Subtle mechanism* [yuán jī], means *the central pivot* [huán zhōng]. To grasp the central pivot’s Dao/Way in responding to truth and falsehood, to employ the heart of self-sovereignty in fulfilling one’s purpose—thus, one can fathom the boundless, ever-transforming principle.

【Six】【Commentary】 *What one does* [suǒwéi] is *true nature* [zhēnxìng]. Do not *turn your intent* [zhuǎn nǐ zhì], lest you perform the deeds of the sages; do not *fixate your mind* [chéng ér xīn], lest you study the Dao/Way of *ren* [仁] and *yì* [義]. To abandon oneself and imitate others will only cause you to lose your true nature.

◎ *Wang Yanzun* says: *"Do not turn and act"* [wú zhuǎn ér xíng]—*zhuǎn* is read as *zhuān* [专]. In the *"Shanmu"* [山木] chapter, it states: *"One dragon, one serpent, together transforming with the times, yet never willing to act in singularity."* This is the same as *"not acting in singularity"* [wú zhuān ér xíng]. This follows the earlier text—*"adjusting with the seasons’ ebb and flow"* and *"wandering with the Dao/Way"*—stating that one must follow the times and the Dao/Way without acting in singularity. If one acts in singularity and fixes upon *yì* [義], one will lose what one truly does.

Thus, the following text says: *"Rectify your words, and your actions must be true; thus, you will bear your calamities and avoid your misfortunes."* *"Your actions must be true"* is the same as *"acting in singularity."*

In the *"Qiushui"* [秋水] chapter, it says: *"Acting in singularity, it diverges from the Dao."* *"Singularity"* [yī] is also singularity. *"Not acting in singularity"* is the same as *"not acting in singularity."* The characters *zhuān* [专] and *zhuǎn* [转] were interchangeable in ancient times, and both could be written as *chuǎn* [抟]. In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the *Wu Wang Pi* [吴王濞] transmission says: *"Yan Wang chuǎn* [抟] *the Hu troops into Xiaoguan."* The *Yaoin* [索隐] says: *"Chuǎn, pronounced zhuān, meaning to command and lead the Hu troops."* In the *Han Book*, *chuǎn* [抟] is written as *zhuǎn* [转].

【Seven】【Commentary】 Do not *rush toward* [mò bēnfù] wealth and nobility, nor *pursue success* [wú xúnzú]. If one rushes or pursues, one will betray one’s *natural* [tiānrán] nature.

【Collation】 (1) The text is incorrectly cited; the *Zhang Junfang* [张君房] edition reads *"xī"* [昔]. *Bi Gan* was flayed, *Zi Yu* was gouged out—these were the calamities of *zhōng* [忠] [1]; *Zhi Gong* [直躬] drowned to prove his father’s innocence, *Wei Sheng* [尾生] drowned in pursuit of fidelity—these were the misfortunes of *xìn* [信] [2]; *Bao Zi* [鲍子] stood upright to death, *Shen Zi* [申子] neglected his own affairs—these were the harms of *lián* [廉] [3]; *Confucius* did not see his mother, *Jiang Zi* [匡子] did not see his father—these were the losses of *yì* [義] [4].

These are the traditions passed down from antiquity and spoken of in later times, illustrating that a *scholar* [shì] must rectify his words and ensure his actions are true—thus, he will bear his calamities and avoid his misfortunes [5].

「**[1] [Commentary]** *Bi Gan* was loyal in his remonstrance against King Zhou, who declared, *"I have heard that a sage’s heart has nine orifices,"* and thus had his heart cut open to inspect it. *Zi Yu* remonstrated with King Fu Chai, who killed him, and Zi Yu said, *"After my death, gouge out my eyes and hang them at the eastern gate of Wu so that I may witness the destruction of Yue in its conquest of Wu."* These were all instances of extreme loyalty leading to their calamities.

**[Reading Note]** *"Gouged out"* (*loù yǎn*) is pronounced with the *wu* rhyme.

**[2] [Commentary]** *Zhi Gong* proved his father’s guilt for stealing sheep. *Wei Sheng* made an appointment with a woman beneath a beam and drowned while waiting for her. These were all cases of upholding trust and thereby inviting misfortune.

**[3] [Commentary]** *Bao Zi* (Bao Jiao) was upright and incorruptible; when ridiculed by Zi Gong, he embraced a tree and starved to death. *Shen Zi* refers to *Shen Sheng*, the eldest son of Duke Xian of Jin, who, falsely accused by Lady Li, was slandered and, without defending himself, hanged himself.

**[Reading Note]** *"Bao Zi stood upright"* (*Bao Zi lì gān*): Sima Qian says *Bao Zi* was named *Jiao*, a man of the late Zhou. When the times were corrupt, he refused office and lived by gathering wild greens. Zi Gong saw him and asked, *"Why do you not take office and accept stipends?"* He replied, *"There is no worthy ruler to serve."* Zi Gong said, *"If you despise the ruler, you should not dwell in his land or eat his produce. Now you despise his governance yet reside in his territory and consume his crops—how can your resolve and conduct be so contradictory?"* Bao Jiao then abandoned his greens and starved to death. The *Han Shi Wai Zhuan* agrees. Another account says he withered away by the Luo River. *"Shen Zi did not defend himself"* (*Sheng Zi bù zì lǐ*): One text reads *"Sheng Zi buried himself"* (*Sheng Zi zì mái*). Others say it refers to *Shen Tu Di* embracing a jar by the river. Another version reads *"Shen Zi did not defend himself,"* referring to *Shen Sheng*.

**[4] [Commentary]** Confucius, immersed in the pursuit of the sage’s path, traveled among states accepting invitations, and thus did not see his mother upon her death. *Jiang Zi* (Jiang Zhang), of Qi, remonstrated with his father, who exiled him; Jiang Zhang never saw his father again, though he remained devoted to benevolence and righteousness, so absorbed in study that he forgot to return home.

**[Reading Note]** *"Confucius did not see his mother"* (*Kǒngzǐ bù jiàn mǔ*): Li [Fan] says, *"This is unheard of."* *"Jiang Zi did not see his father"* (*Jiang Zi bù jiàn fù*): Sima Qian says *Jiang Zi* was named *Zhang*, of Qi, who remonstrated with his father and was banished, never seeing him again. This account appears in *Mencius*.
**◎** *Lu Wenpiao* remarks: *"It is likely that ‘father’ and ‘mother’ in these two cases should be reversed."*»

At the fifth chapter, the text states that if one values the three *Dao/Way*s (benevolence, righteousness, and propriety), one may fall into *jiaoyao* (excessive rectitude); if one esteems the *shi* (noble/gentleman), one may encounter *shiwei* (deception among gentlemen). Therefore, the sage disdains mere conduct and holds the common man in contempt to preserve his inner integrity, only then can his conduct be exalted and his noble status affirmed.

**[Commentary]** From Bi Gan onward to Jiang Zhang, all were men of loyalty, sincerity, and integrity who met with misfortune. These are accounts passed down from antiquity, recounted by later generations.
Thus, sincere and loyal gentlemen, virtuous and upright individuals, who straighten their words to remonstrate with their rulers and rectify their conduct to serve their lords, inevitably encounter calamity and suffer misfortune. Those who follow the *Dao/Way* should deeply guard against such dangers.

**[Reading Note]** In *"what is passed down"* (*shuǒ chuán*), the character 申 (*shēn*) is pronounced *shèng* (专).
**[Collation Notes]** (1) The *Shide Tang* edition reads 申 (*shēn*) as 胜 (*shèng*), and the reading note also uses 胜 (*shèng*).
(2) The *Shide Tang* edition has 不 (*bù*) beneath 子 (*zǐ*).
(3) The Zhao edition reads 尚 (*shàng*) as 上 (*shàng*).

Wúzú, a man of insatiable greed, asked Zhīhé, who understood the *Dao/Way* of harmony and moderation and upheld propriety in purity and integrity:

“There has never been a man who did not seek fame and profit. If one is wealthy, people gather around him; if he is humble, they honor him; if he is honored, he becomes esteemed. To see one held in esteem, this is the *Dao/Way* to ensure longevity, physical comfort, and joy in life. Yet you alone show no interest in this. Do you not know what is insufficient, or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or is it that you cling to righteousness and never forget it?”

**[Commentary]** Wúzú refers to those greedy and insatiable individuals who never have enough. Zhīhé refers to those who inherently understand the *Dao/Way* of harmony and moderation, and who maintain purity and integrity. The dialogue is hypothetical, illustrating the consequences of greed and virtue. Wúzú said:

“In the end, no one in the world fails to pursue fame and follow profit. If one is rich, people flock to him; if he is humble, they exalt him; if he is exalted, he gains honor. He who is humble and honored will have his desires fulfilled, his nature content, and his body at ease, thus living long. You alone have no desire for wealth and honor? Do you know that fame is insufficient and thus not seek it? Or do you know in your heart what is right, but lack the strength to act, so you adhere to righteousness and never forget it, thereby dispelling your greedy desires and not taking what you should?”

**[Reading Note]** In *"Wúzú"* (*wúzú*), one version reads 无知 (*wúzhī*).

「The *Zéxià* [1] reads *xiájià fǎn* [2]. Below follows the same reading. The *Lèyì* [3] is pronounced *luò*. Below follows the same reading. The *Zhībù* [4] is pronounced *zhì*. Below, *zhī* and *móu* share the same reading.

**[Annotation]** *Zhī* (知) and *bù* (不) are pronounced *zhì* (智) here.

◎Qìngfān [5] notes that *yì* (意) is a word, read as *yì* (抑). *Yì* (抑) was an ancient character also meaning *yì* (意). In the *Lunyu* [6] *Xuéér* [7] chapter, *yì* (抑) and *yǔ* (与) are used interchangeably, while the Han *Shíjīng* [8] renders *yì* (抑) as *yì* (意). In the *Mòzǐ* [9] *Míngguǐ* [10] chapter, *qǐ* (岂) and *nǚ* (女) are used for *yǔ* (与), while *Bào* (鲍) uses *yì* (意). These are all corroborating instances.

**[Translation]**

The *Zhībù* [11] passage states: "This person, assuming he was born alongside me and dwells in my native place, believes himself to be one who transcends the common and surpasses the world. Indeed, he is one who clings solely to his own subjective standards, thus failing to discern the shifts of time across ages or the true boundaries of right and wrong, and instead aligning himself with the vulgar. The world abandons what is most precious—life—and forsakes what is most exalted—the Dao [12]. He takes this as his own doing! Thus, his reasoning on the Dao [12] of long life, bodily ease, and joyous contentment is far removed indeed [13]!

The agonies of sorrow and the tranquility of delight do not manifest in his physical form [14]; the dread of fear and the exhilaration of joy do not enter his mind. Knowing only *what is done* (*wéiwéi*) [15] but not *the source of its doing* (*suǒyǐwéi*) [16], even if he were a noble emperor, wealthy beyond the world, he would still not escape suffering [17]!"

Wúzú [18] further states:

“Now, wealth bestowed upon a person benefits him in every way—it fulfills all desires, exhausts all pleasures, and reaches all limits of indulgence. Even the sage cannot attain it, the worthy cannot rival it, and the bold rely on it for their strength and might. The clever use it for their shrewdness, the virtuous [19] for their moral power, and the noble for their authority. It is not merely the enjoyment of a kingdom but the stern governance of a sovereign father [20].

Moreover, the sounds, colors, tastes, and political power—these bring joy to the heart without need of study and ease to the body without need of ritual form [21]. The inclinations toward pleasure and avoidance of pain, the pursuit of gain and shunning of loss, are inherent in human nature. If the world is not mine, who could refuse it?” [22]

「【一】**[Annotation]** *Qióng* (穷) – Exhaustive; thorough.  *Jǐu* (究) – Ultimate; perfect.  *Shàn* (埶) – Pronounced as *shì* (势), meaning power or influence.
Exhausting all the good and beautiful things in the world, and thoroughly grasping the power and influence of humanity—who but the wealthy and noble could achieve such? Thus, even those of supreme virtue and sagely wisdom cannot reach them.

**[Annotation]** *Yīng* (雍) – Harmonious; concordant.  *Shàn* (善) – Good; virtuous.  *Shàn* (弒) – Usurpation (of throne).
Emperor Yao and Shun ruled in harmony, not because they cherished humanity’s benevolence, but because they did not let beauty and luxury harm life. The virtuous Shàn (善卷) and Xu You declined the throne, not out of false modesty in yielding, but because they did not let worldly affairs harm themselves. These were all cases of accepting what benefits them and declining what harms them, yet the world praises them as sages—this proves they had no intention of seeking fame, only avoiding peril.

**[Annotation]** *Yán* (阨) – Pronounced as *è* (厄), meaning calamity or distress; also *wǔmài* (乌卖) – same.
If one insists on upholding one’s reputation, enduring hardship to deny oneself sweetness, restraining nourishment to preserve life, then one is no different from a chronic invalid suffering long-term illness and prolonged distress, yet still clinging to life—though the days of such existence are already like those of the dying!

**[Annotation]** *Fèng* (冯) – To indulge in; to wallow in.  *Qì* (气) – Vital energy; also, in this context, refers to the breath or spirit of life.
The wealthy, enraptured by the clamor of bells and drums, the jingling of coins and keys, and the savor of coarse grains, livestock, and strong drink—these stir their desires, causing them to neglect their affairs. This is truly chaotic!

To wallow in the breath of luxury, like one burdened with heavy loads ascending a steep slope—this is truly suffering! To hoard wealth for comfort, to wield power to exhaustion, to indulge in ease when at rest, to revel in excess when bathed in prosperity—this is truly illness!

For the sake of becoming wealthy and pursuing gain, they grow full like walls yet know not to avoid danger, and wallow in excess without relinquishing it—this is truly shameful!

Wealth accumulates yet serves no purpose, luxuries are embraced yet never discarded, their hearts brimming with sorrow and distress, yet they still crave more—this is truly a cause for worry!

Within, the perils of suspicion and deceitful intrigues fester;
without, the dread of bandits and thieves looms.
Confined to guarded halls, yet daring not to walk alone abroad—
this is truly fear! **[Seven]**

These six afflictions are the gravest plagues of the world,
yet they are ignored and unexamined.
When disaster strikes, they exhaust their virtue and wealth,
only to find that even a single day’s reversal of fortune is unattainable. **[Eight]**

Thus, when sought by name, they are unseen;
when pursued for gain, they elude grasp.
Yet they fixate their minds and bodies in contention for these very things—
is this not bewilderment? **[Nine]**

---

As for the principle of equality bestowing blessings upon the virtuous
and drawing misfortune to those who hoard excess—
this is the natural order of Heaven.
All things follow this way, yet none more so than wealth. **[One]**

**[Codicil]** *Sāo* (嗛), meaning "to indulge to excess."
*Guanque* (管钥), flutes and pipes of the *xiaodie* (箫笛) class—
the wealthy, unrestrained in their licentiousness,
their mouths steeped in strong drink,
their ears deafened by *gongshang* (宮商) music,
their hearts slipping into wantonness at every turn,
stirred by every sensation—
their nature grows dim and confused,
their affairs forgotten, unnoticed—
how is this not chaos? **[Two]**

**[Collation Note]** *Guan* (管) pronounced as in the seal script.
Originally also written as *guan* (管).

「**《Pinyao》** pronounced as *yào* (药).
**[One]** originally written as *guanpinyao* (筦钥) or *xūn* (埙).
**《Kǒu sāo》** pronounced with *ku* as in *kǔ jiàn* (苦簟), *sāo* as in *kuài* (快).
**[Annotation]** Qing Fan (庆藩) notes: *sāo* (嗛) means "to delight."
*Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字): *sāo* (嗛), either "to take pleasure in" or "to hold in the mouth" **[four]**.
Zhao Ce (赵策) in *Shìshī* (食史) took delight in *sāo* (嗛) at Wei, while Qi Huan Gong (齐桓公) did not take pleasure in *Yíyá* (易牙) even at midnight.
Gao (高) in both cases notes: *sāo* (嗛) means "to delight."
In *Xúnzǐ Róngrǔ Piān* (荀子荣辱篇), "to delight in its stench without taking pleasure in the nose" **[sāo]**, Yang Shen (杨倞) reads *sāo* (嗛) as *qiàn* (慊), meaning "to satiate" or "to be weary of."
**[Error]** This reading is incorrect.

**《Láo》** pronounced as *liào* (力刀).
**[Three]** **[Codicil]** *Féngqì* (冯气), akin to *fènmèn* (愤懑).
When avarice and desire grow excessive,
toils and servitude become oppressive,
the heart is choked and submerged in *féngqì* (愤懑),
just as one burdened with heavy loads climbs a steep hill.
This weariness and exhaustion—
is it not suffering and hardship? **[Annotation]** *Féng* (冯) pronounced as *fèn* (愤), meaning "to be filled with resentment."
**[Note]** The same below.

**《Ér shàng》** pronounced as *shì zhǎng* (时掌).
**[Four]** **[Codicil]** Those who greedily amass wealth and treasures
to soothe their hearts,
or flatter and curry favor to exhaust their minds,
who dwell in ease and idleness—
their bodies sink into *chénnyì* (沉溺),
and when their physical and mental *qi* (气) are smooth and lustrous,
*féngmèn* (愤懑) arises.
Struggling in motion or stillness, burdened by suffering—
is this not a sickness? **[Annotation]** *Wèi* (慰) also written as *wèi* (畏).
**[Annotation]** Qing Fan (庆藩) notes: *Wèi* (慰) should be associated with *wèi* (蔚).
In *Huáinán Túzhēn Piān* (淮南俶真篇), "the five viscera lack *wèi* (蔚) *qi* (气)," Gao (高) notes: *wèi* (蔚) means "illness."
In *Miǎo Chēng Piān* (缪称篇), "dwarfs and blind teachers are those who suffer *wèi* (困慰)."
Gao (高) notes: *wèi* (慰) means "illness."
Thus, the terms *wèi* (蔚) and *wèi* (慰) were interchangeably used in ancient explanations.

**[Five]** **[Codicil]** *Dǔ* (堵), meaning "wall."
To seek wealth and profit is like a bottomless pit or a wall—
like a wall built with bricks and mud until it overflows,
the heart is filled with *féngmèn* (愤懑),
greed and covetousness never cease,
unaware of avoiding harm—
is this not shameful? **[Annotation]** *Shě* (舍) pronounced as *shě* (舍).
**[Note]** The same below.

**[Sixth Codicil]** *Qìjiào* (戚醮), meaning "affliction."
To accumulate without dispersing, to cling without release—
greed knows no satisfaction, affliction fills the heart.
If we examine it thoroughly,
is this not sorrow and distress?

**[Annotation]** Qing Fan notes: *Fúyīng* (服膺) while not releasing is the same as the earlier *féng* (冯) while not releasing.
*Fúyīng* (服膺) means "to rely upon."
In *Wén Xuǎn* (文选), the *Hàn Gāozǔ Gōngchén Sòng* (汉高祖功臣颂) has *féngyīng* (冯膺) but is missing the second character.
**[Annotation]** *Yīng* (膺) in *Wén Xuǎn* is mistakenly written as *yìng* (应).
Li Shàn’s annotation mistakenly takes it as "relying on auspicious omens," which is incorrect.
In antiquity, *yìng* (应) and *yīng* (膺) were homophonous and interchangeable.
In the *Kāng Gào* (康诰), *yìng* (应) means "to protect the people of Yin."
In the *Zhōu Gào* (周诰), *yīng* (膺) means "to bear the virtue of the people."
In the *Shī Jīng* (诗经), *Shì Gōng Yán* (閟宫篇), *yīng* (膺) refers to "the barbarians of Róng and Dí."
In *Shǐ Jì* (史记), the *Jiàn Yuán Lái Hóu Zhě Nián Biǎo* (建元以来侯者年表) writes *yìng* (应) instead of *yīng* (膺).
In *Mèngzǐ* (孟子), *Téng Wén Gōng Piān* (滕文公篇), *yīng* (膺) refers to "the barbarians of Róng and Dí."
**[Annotation]** *Yīngyì Yì* (音义) states: The *Dīng* (丁) edition writes *yīng* (膺) as *yìng* (应).

The *fúyīng* (服膺) of relying upon is akin to *fúshì* (伏轼) meaning "to rely upon the chariot pole,"
*(Shǐ Jì* (史记), *Lǚ Shēng Zhuàn* (郦生传): *fúshì* (伏轼) submits to Qi and yields seventy-odd cities; *Hàn Shū* (汉书) writes *féngshì* (冯轼).)
*fúqín* (伏琴) meaning "to rely upon the zither,"
*(Shǐ Jì* (史记), *Wèi Shì Jiā* (魏世家): *zhōngqín* (凭琴); *Suōyuàn* (索隐) states: *Spring and Autumn Annals* later editions write *fúqín* (伏琴).)
*yīnfú* (茵伏) meaning "to rely upon the cushion."
*(Shǐ Jì* (史记), *Kù Lì Zhuàn* (酷吏传): *yīnfú* (茵伏) never dared to equal; *Hàn Shū* (汉书) writes *yīnféng* (茵冯).)

**[Annotation]** *Qìjiào* (戚醮) is pronounced in the *yáo* (遥) rhyme.
Li (李) says: Also pronounced *yě* (也).
Again, pronounced *zǐmiào* (子妙).

**[Seventh Codicil]** *Yí* (疑), meaning "fear."
*Qǐng* (请), meaning "to seek."
An ordinary man, though innocent, bears the guilt of possessing treasure—
thus, at home, he fears the calamities of thieves and robbers,
abroad, he dreads bandits, plunder, and theft.
Hence, he surrounds his courtyard with walls, raises high windows and towers,
exposes his inner and outer chambers,
yet still trembles in fear with every passing stranger,
daring not to walk alone.
Such hardship—
is this not terror?

**[Annotation]** *Yí* (疑): Pronounced *xǔyè* (许业) or *qūyè* (曲业).
*[Nèizhōu Lóu Shū]* (内周楼疏): Li (李) says: "Inner towers encircle densely, outer verandas connect sparsely"—referring to defensive preparations.

**[Eighth Codicil]** The six [afflictions] refer to chaos, suffering, sickness, humiliation, sorrow, and fear.
*Pán* (殚), meaning "exhausted."
The gravest of calamities is overlooked until bandits strike suddenly—
life and death hang in the balance,
a lifetime of greed vanishes in an instant,
all wealth and treasures are stripped away,
and yet one seeks to return to a single day of poverty—
how could this be possible?

**[Annotation]** *Cáidān* (财单): Pronounced *dān* (丹).
Originally written as *qí* (蕲), pronounced *qí* (祁).
**[Annotation]** Family tradition states: The *Shìwén* (释文) originally wrote *qí* (蕲), pronounced *qí* (祁), but this is incorrect.
*Dān* (单) should be written as *dǎn* (亶).
In *Shǐ Jì* (史记), *Lìshǔ* (历书), *dān* (单) and *àn* (阏) are written together; Chuì Jǎn (崔骃) annotates: *Dānàn* (单阏) is also written as *dǎn’ān* (亶安).
*Dān* (单) and *dǎn* (亶) are interchangeable.
In *Hàn Shū* (汉书), *dàn* (但) is often written as *dǎn* (亶).
In *Jiǎ Yǔ Zhuàn* (贾谊传): "Not merely *dǎn* (亶) to invert the suspended."
In *Yáng Xióng Zhuàn* (扬雄传): "*Dǎn* (亶) expends spirit here."
*Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字): *Dàn* (但), meaning "to bare one’s upper body."
Thus, *dàn* (但) is the same as *chàn* (儃) written as *dàn* (但).
*Dān* (单) means "to return to a single day of nothingness," akin to saying "but to return to a single day of nothingness."
*Yùpiàn* (玉篇): *Dān* (单), meaning "one," also akin to "solely," sharing meaning with *dàn* (但).

**[Ninth Annotation]** This chapter speaks of those who know contentment always being content.
*Liáo* (缭), meaning "to entangle."
When bandits strike, the body is no longer one’s own—
at that moment, how could one still see name and profit?
Yet common folk invert this utterly:
their hearts are entangled in name and profit,
their minds are severed from all restraint in pursuit,
and thus, in this regard,
is this not the height of delusion?

**[Annotation]** *Liáo* (缭): Pronounced *liǎo* (了) or *yúdiào* (鱼吊), meaning "principle."
**[Collation]**
(1) Zhào Jiànyì’s (赵谏议) manuscript writes *guǎn* (管) instead of *quán* (筦).
(2) The *bǎn* (阪) character follows Chéng’s (成) annotation.
**[Annotation]** The text mistakenly cites Zhāng Jūnfáng’s (张君房) edition as *bǎn* (阪), which is the same as *bǎn* (阪).
(3) Zhāng Jūnfáng’s (张君房) edition writes *rǔ* (辱) instead of *wèi* (慰).
(4) The characters *xián* (衔) and *yě* (也) follow Guó Cè’s (国策) Gao’s (高) annotation.
