**The Ten Right Paths for Female Cultivation by the Queen Mother of the West**

**Preface to the Ten Right Paths**

The Pure Yang Master, having vowed to ferry all beings across the sea of suffering, previously composed the *Annotations on the Scripture of the Nine August Elixirs* as a guiding bridge for men’s immortal cultivation. Yet, unwilling to stand idle while women of innate predispositions and long-held Daoist aspirations lacked true transmission—risking stray paths and descent into ghostly realms—he ascended the Resplendent Radiance Tower on the first day of the tenth lunar month in the *jiwei* year. There, moved by the Unparalleled Immortal Maiden, he earnestly conveyed the oral transmission of the Queen Mother of the West to the Perfected Wei Yuanjun, originally titled *The Great Golden Elixir Formula for Women*. Expounding upon it, he revised it into *Nine Right Paths for Female Cultivation*, still prefaced with the name of the Queen Mother of the West, and appended the *Nine Precepts for Female Perfected* to rectify Daoist mores. Together, these form ten paths, all to be received under the compassionate sanction of the Dao. Those who fail to embody them shall bear the weight of their neglect. The Immortal Maiden exhorted all, for the Dao’s efficacy knows no bounds, yet its foundation begins with these ten paths. Thus, this preface.

The Unparalleled Perfected Sun Zhenyi declared: Though scriptures for female immortals exist in the world, most are riddled with convoluted and erroneous teachings, leading deluded followers to fabricate and misappropriate, deceiving both themselves and others. Some even guide souls into the abyss of spirits, spreading calamity far and wide. The Dao’s Ancestor, in profound generosity, lamented only their fall into ghostly realms. I, Zhenyi, have long grieved this! Fortunate to receive the Dao Ancestor’s commission to revise and refine, I meticulously collated and expurgated the texts. Adhering strictly to the original *Great Golden Elixir Formula for Women* of the Queen Mother of the West and incorporating the oral transmission of the Mysterious Shadow of the Great Dao by the Divine Mother of Jade Purity, I compiled nine paths and presented them for scrutiny. The Dao is not meant to remain forever hidden, and I was graciously permitted to revise them. Entitled *The Right Paths for Female Cultivation by the Queen Mother of the West*, they are prefaced with the *Nine Precepts for Female Perfected*, forming ten paths in total. I further sought to elucidate their profound mysteries, so that women cultivating the Dao—though the Earthly Way yields no completion—may yet fulfill their destined roles in assisting transformation and nurturing life. They may embody and practice this great Dao, receiving it under the compassionate sanction of the Dao. Henceforth, the female lineage shall not only avoid stray paths but also ascend directly to the celestial palaces. The resurgence of the Dao’s destiny is at hand. With reverent joy, I inscribe this preface at the Resplendent Radiance Tower in Wulin, a testament to my fortune.

Respectfully inscribed by Sun Zhenyi, disciple of the Orthodox Quanzhen Dao, with a hundred bows.

**The Ten Right Paths for Female Cultivation by the Queen Mother of the West**

**First Path: Receiving the Nine Precepts**
It is said that for female cultivation, one must first receive the Nine Precepts. The precepts state: Unwavering practice yields great benefit; the fruition of precepts spares one the torments of hell, ensures rebirth in a household of the Ten Virtues, inscribes one’s name in the Purple Palace, and ranks one among the immortals. Now, in promulgating the *Right Paths for Female Cultivation*, the *Nine Precepts* shall serve as the first path. The text reads:

1. Be filial, respectful, gentle, and harmonious; speak cautiously and without envy.
2. Maintain chastity and tranquility; distance yourself from all impure conduct.
3. Cherish all living beings; be compassionate and abstain from killing.
4. Be diligent and reverent in ritual and recitation; abstain from meat and wine. Wear plain garments and eschew ornate adornments.
5. Cultivate your nature and temper your emotions; do not give rise to afflictions.
6. Do not organize or attend vegetarian feasts.
7. Do not mistreat servants or slaves.
8. Do not conceal goodness or broadcast evil.

Only by upholding these Nine Precepts may one receive and uphold the right paths. For what is promulgated here is most precious and sacred. To transmit or receive without precepts is to profane the celestial treasure. Both giver and receiver shall share in the punishment. Be cautious and solemn.

**[Note: Each of the following paths begins with “It is said,” as the text was recorded by the disciple from the oral transmission of the Queen Mother of the West, akin to the Buddhist sutras’ opening “Thus have I heard” or the Daoist scriptures’ “The Dao declares.” Originally, the Nine Precepts were placed before the first path, preceding texts on purifying the body, speech, and altar. Only after the Patriarch Lü’s revision were the precepts expounded and compiled as the first path, making the Dao’s principle of not transmitting lightly immediately apparent.]**

It is said: The Second Path of the Right Way for Women’s Cultivation, titled **"The Original Destiny."**

To speak of women is to speak of yin substance, of the moon’s image. At the ages of thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen, when primordial *qi* is abundant and true blood is full, there exists within yin a single yang—like the moon at its fullest brilliance. But when the celestial waters descend, the primordial *qi* is breached, and true blood flows away. After marriage, should she bear sons or daughters, her primordial *qi* gradually wanes, her true blood steadily depletes. Though each month the menses return, each month they also bring fresh harm. Herein lies the difficulty of a woman’s cultivation.

If a woman wishes to preserve her destiny and return to the origin, she must seek the method of cultivation. With the method, her progress will be swift. This path is titled **"The Original Destiny"** because a woman’s destiny hinges upon the celestial waters. If the celestial waters are not transformed, how can her destiny be preserved? Without this, the return to the origin remains distant—yet the method of cultivation is most precious. Thus, the **"Nine Precepts"** form the first path, and **"The Original Destiny"** the second, embodying the principle of cultivating nature before destiny. Following this path, the next is titled **"The Origin of Nature,"** for the cultivation of nature is precisely what preserves destiny.

**[Note: While the first path was newly compiled by Patriarch Lü, the second through ninth paths were originally edited by the Unwavering Primordial Sovereign and later revised by Patriarch Lü, ensuring clarity. The language is direct to prevent the text from obscuring the meaning and misleading later generations. Readers must not dismiss it as lacking in archaic elegance and doubt its divine authorship. As for the tenth path, it was entirely composed by Patriarch Lü, further elaborating on the principles established thereafter.]**

---

It is said: The Third Path of the Right Way for Women’s Cultivation, titled **"The Origin of Nature."**

To speak of women is to speak of water’s nature, of a flower’s essence. In youth, when awareness awakens, she must discipline herself, refrain from idle play, and guard against reckless movement. At this time, a single drop of initial essence resides within the inner gate—like a star, like a pearl—this is the supreme treasure of the prior heavens, concealed above the earthly womb, centered within the yellow court. If, at this time, a woman knows to purify her nature, avoids lewd entertainments, refrains from listening to licentious words, maintains serene conduct, and moves in accordance with inner principles, then this essence will adhere to the celestial nature, becoming the primordial unity, the unchanging crimson pearl, and the celestial waters will not descend.

Alas, most women, ignorant and childlike, delight in motion. Whether in play or in haste, their *qi* stirs, their minds waver, their spirits become disordered, and their true *qi* unstable. Then this celestial treasure, like a star, melts away. Its heat, like fire, forces the gate open and rushes forth—what the world calls the celestial waters. From this point onward, even if she remains chaste and unwed, she is but an ordinary woman. There is no other reason: she does not recognize **"The Origin of Nature."** Those who aspire to cultivation must begin from this lower path.

**[Note: The "inner gate" refers to the yin portal. Below, it is also called the "spring gate" or "yin portal," hence the gate within the yellow court is termed the "inner gate." Furthermore, the initial essence of destiny, if one does not know stillness, will adhere to the celestial nature and transform into the primordial unity. Ancient sagely women practiced this—Bodhisattvas and Heavenly Consorts are proof. Though the world is not lacking in wise women, alas! Without inner immortal parents or outer sagely teachers and friends, their wisdom leads only to repeated falls.]**

---

It is said: The Fourth Path of the Right Way for Women’s Cultivation, titled **"Cultivating the Menses."**

Once the celestial waters have descended, the true *qi* is breached, and the true blood is depleted. Without cultivating the menses, true blood diminishes daily, true *qi* wanes daily. Even with diligent practice, what benefit can there be? The *Book of the Elixir* states: *"When bamboo is broken, it must be mended with bamboo."* What is the method? For those with monthly menses, first sever the Red Dragon. For those without, first restore and then sever. In all cases, begin with the method of encircling greatness.

At the hours of *zi* and *wu*, sit astride a crane, release all concerns, and knock the teeth seventy-two times to open the lung and transport points. Then, using both nostrils, take thirty-six gentle breaths to circulate the blood and *qi* throughout the body. At this time, fearing leakage of *qi* downward, one must sit firmly, not allowing slackness. Place both hands in a V-shape below the navel and above the gate, directing *qi* backward and upward with intention for thirty-six breaths. Next, raise both hands as if supporting the heavens, focusing the mind on the coccyx, guiding *qi* backward and upward for another thirty-six breaths. Then perform thirty-six slow lifts and thirty-six rapid lifts, until sensing the *qi* at the tailbone stirring with an ascending momentum.

After this, lower the hands and place them on the waist, using the shoulders to lift straight upward thirty-six times, until sensing the *qi* at the spine’s pass and lung transport points rising. If there is blockage, clench the teeth tightly, focus the mind on the back of the neck, and lift upward thirty-six times, until the jade pillow and mud pill are unobstructed. Only then, cover the upper lip with the lower lip, applying gentle pressure, so the *qi* from the mud pill descends to the bridge of the nose. At this time, merely rest the tongue on the heavenly bridge without force, focusing the mind on the point where the tongue touches—sweet dew will naturally descend. Then, slightly contract the nostrils, swallow the dew with intention, directing it straight to the vermilion palace. Hold it there briefly, then guide it backward, dividing it left and right to the waist, rotating thirty-six times on each side.

Then guide the intention to divide and direct it toward the navel wheel, rotating thirty-six times to the left and thirty-six times to the right, until the entire abdomen feels unobstructed and at ease. At this moment, the hands remain clasped below the navel and above the gate, with intention simultaneously directing left and right, lifting together thirty-six times—then one senses a single point entering the womb. Here, one should maintain a state of *nearly forgetting yet faintly retaining*, lingering but briefly.

This outlines the general method of refining the meridians. Within it lies an ineffable, supreme technique, which cannot yet be spoken of—yet it is encompassed by the phrase: *"abide in stillness and emptiness while observing."*

[Note on terminology: The "womb" here refers to the *inner gate* (*nei pin*), the mysterious aperture in men. As the *Book of the Elixir* states: *"Yang is called the mysterious, yin is called the gate."* Together, this is what Laozi termed the *"gate of the mysterious female"* and what the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Conduit Classic* calls the *"wondrous vessel."* Whether termed the wondrous vessel, the mysterious aperture, the gate of the female, or the womb—though the names differ, the cavity is one. This passage uses "womb" as a metaphor drawn from human affairs to clarify the point, for both the sacred embryo and the ordinary embryo take form here.

Another note: The phrase *"not beyond"* implies there is a subtle principle to be embodied, cautioning against carelessness.]

When the womb receives a swirling surge of warm *qi*, the spring gate must be tightly sealed—never relaxed—to savor the blissful subtlety. The greatest danger lies in the arising of thoughts or the slightest attachment, for this will cause the entire body to dissolve into tingling numbness. If this occurs, one must swiftly settle the mind, for here the paths of immortality and mortality diverge.

[This warns against laxity: if the gate is even slightly loosened, the true *qi* will leak away. What follows is even more perilous. At this stage, the gate must produce an extraordinary tingling sensation; with further lifting and sealing, the inner gate will yield an unparalleled delight. Without steadfast composure, the body will dissolve into numbness, slipping into the sea of desire. Even if one then seeks to settle the mind, it may be too late—hence, *"the paths of immortality and mortality diverge here."*

Master Taixu once said: *"The method lies in turning the back to Kan (☵) and tasting sweetness—only then can the passions be stilled."* Otherwise, the gate will yawn open, and essence will gush forth like a torrent. Alas!]

At this moment, one must swiftly quiet the mind for an extended time, silently awaiting stillness in the Zi Gong until it settles—this is precisely what Lady Wei Yuan meant by *"the treasure returns to the Northern Sea, secure and at peace."* Yet this remains but a *"yellow leaf to quiet a child’s cry"*—take care not to mistake it for the formation of the embryo.

[Note: The "Sea of Awareness" is the Southern Sea, and thus this Zi Gong is the Northern Sea, though its position lies north of the Central Ultimate and the Yellow Center—here, front and back define south and north, not above and below. Moreover, Lady Wei Yuan’s verse suffices as proof, so one must silently await stillness in the Zi Gong before ceasing practice. Another note: This method applies even to those whose *Red Dragon* has not yet been severed; when practicing up to and beyond the slaying of the Dragon, one must proceed with utmost stillness—any carelessness will ruin all progress, hence *"the paths of immortality and mortality diverge here."*

Further note: This stage constitutes the full *"round reflection"*—the return to the origin and reversion to the root. When the embryo is formed, the mysterious image is already complete. Yet this is merely the refinement and return of the Five Phases within the microcosm of the body, a minor return and reversion. It may be achieved through daily or hourly practice, as the *Canon of the Elixir* states: *"one grain returns to one grain"*—this is that very treasure. Thus, the analogy of the yellow leaf is used for clarity, but the methods of gathering, forging, guiding, and settling it are nothing less than the complete process of the *"Great Return and Mysterious Reflection."* One must grasp this with care and not pass over it recklessly.]

As for the fifth method in the proper path of female cultivation, it is titled *"Return and Reversion."* It speaks of women in the world—some who reach old age without their bodies being purified, others whose *Dragon* has already been severed by forty-five or forty-six—all of whom should cultivate to return to the original state, just like a maiden. This practice and method are the same as those in the previous four stages, only with the upward and posterior ascent changed to a forward and downward infusion, flowing back into the *"Stream and Sea."*

Gather the sweet nectar, swallowing only to retain it at the threshold, never allowing it to descend. Then, with hands, massage the *"Breast Stream"*—thirty-six rotations to the left, thirty-six to the right—until this threshold-stream reveals a melting, delightful savor. Next, divide the hands to massage both breasts: thirty-six slow strokes, thirty-six swift strokes, first light then heavy, each performed thirty-six times, totaling one hundred and forty-four. Naturally, one will feel the true *qi* suffusing both chambers and the stream, as cool liquid like a spring wells from the *"Twin Passes"* and surges into the *"Southern Sea."* Calm the mind and await it, never permitting the *qi* to disperse into the flanks afterward. Only allow all thoughts to settle in the *"Central Palace,"* while refraining entirely from guiding or directing—simply let it disperse of its own accord. One will then feel the whole body profoundly clear and harmonious.

Practicing thus without interruption each day, the weak will gradually grow strong, the frail will gradually become robust, and the aged will gradually regain youth. The face will bloom with color, the breasts will gradually retract like a maiden’s, and within, something will congeal like a peach pit. Within a hundred days, the *"Heavenly Water"* will assume the hue of rouge-water. After three days, proceed with the practices of the fourth stage, without the slightest addition or alteration—thus will the *"Red Dragon"* be severed once more. Yet only when the *"Infant Sun and Moon"* manifest as twin rings is true attainment achieved.

[**Note for Clarity:** The *Daoist Canon* states that even elderly women may still have *"trust-water,"* though this is not true menstrual blood but rather the fluids of food and drink, transformed by the *"ministerial fire"* of the *qi*-phase and failing to return to the liver and spleen. It may become intestinal bleeding, red discharge, or inverted menstruation—all symptoms of deficiency. Thus, those whose menses have ceased prematurely must first cultivate restoration to a maiden-like state before attempting to sever the *"Dragon."* **Further Note:** The character *"得见"* (*de jian*) should be read with the rhyme of *"现"* (*xian*), for here *"见"* (*jian*) takes the meaning of *"现"* (*manifestation*). Only when the mind is still and the body is quiescent can the signs appear. The *"manifestation"* (*现*) of *"若"* (*ruo*, "as if") is the very *"见"* (*perception*) of the body. These two characters—*"见"* and *"现"*—carry both shallow and profound meanings; they must not be read carelessly.]

If we speak of the sixth principle in the proper path of female cultivation, it is titled *"The Breasts."* This refers to how the breasts connect upward to the fluids of the heart and lungs and downward to the true essences of the Sea of Blood. When the breasts are refined to resemble those of a maiden or a child, this is the female body transformed into the male form. The method of practice does not depart from the fourth and fifth principles.

Women take blood as their foundation, yet the aim of this principle lies in refining the red to return to the white. However, as the foundation is often deficient, there is the step of refining fluids into blood. To transform fluids into blood, nothing surpasses the method of *"dew lingering at the palace gate,"* where the spirit is directed to the twin passes. Within the passes, old stagnant turbid fluids melt naturally and flow like streams into the sea. When the blood returns and life flourishes, the subtle essence of this lies in the fifth principle.

If one wishes to transform blood back into white, nothing compares to focusing the mind on the *"stream chambers,"* clenching the teeth tightly, and intensifying the emptiness and stillness of the heart-mind, so that *qi* naturally returns to the streams and reaches the chambers. Then, using both palms to knead the breasts—first slowly, then swiftly; first gently, then with greater force—perform this one hundred and forty-four times. The *qi* gathers and doubles in vigor. Afterward, withdraw the intent and direct it to the two flanks. Further, guide the *qi* with the eyes, rotating it left and right, completing seventy-two breaths. The *qi* must feel as if warmed by moxibustion.

The intent should then lead the *qi* in circling the wheel without counting the cycles, until the lower extremity feels as if boiling. Thus, the red transforms into fresh white, which must then be refined into *qi*, piercing the spine, ascending the ridge, crossing the pillow, and penetrating the valley. At this moment, the inner vision reveals the Three Mystic Mountains and the Pure Garden—yet this is not as pure as the tranquil state. One must swiftly engage in *"forgetting forgetting,"* suddenly entering the profound darkness of night. Abiding in stillness, over time, the eyes will perceive lightning flashes and thunderous roars, dew descending like rain, the Flower Pool overflowing, swallowing beyond measure. The *qi* descends smoothly to the palace gate and reaches the navel, suffusing the entire body with clarity and harmony. I remain in quiescent observation.

After one hundred unbroken days of practice, those with firm breasts will find them as flat as a youth’s; those with hollow breasts will find them as full as walnuts, like a maiden’s. Achieving the form of a youth results from the completion of the white-refining practice; attaining the form of a maiden results from the completion of the red-refining practice.

Within our tradition, those who have attained verification are not few; among them, one who has composed poetry is Mistress Feng. Her verses may serve as testimony. Her poem reads:

*"Left sun, right moon—one yin-yang,
Through the nose’s pass, the inner work is called ‘moving the Gang.’
Should you wish yin and yang to return to sun and moon,
Grasp the true fire and knead the twin chambers."*

Let the practitioner take heed.

[**Note:** The "twin passes" lie between the spine and the palace behind it. Within these passes are two cavities where the *niye* (muddy fluid) resides—left called *gao*, right called *huang*—places where medicinal power cannot reach and true *qi* does not naturally arrive. The *niye* lodges as a calamity within the body. When Nature creates a person, it establishes these passes to guard the heart, hence the name "twin passes." Though called *ni* (mud) and *ye* (fluid), it is not true fluid but rather a transformation of food and drink, a kind of humor. Borne by *qi*, it spreads through the lungs to moisten the meridians throughout the body—this is its function. When the body’s true *qi* is abundant, the substance is transformed and its uses are boundless. If true *qi* declines, the substance remains untransformed, flowing into the viscera and meridians without causing harm. However, when it encounters extreme yin *qi*, it congeals into *niye*—seemingly essence yet not essence—obstructing the pathways of *qi*. The places where it lingers most are the twin passes and the lower extreme. Of these, the twin passes harbor the greatest harm, for true *qi* does not reach them naturally. Thus, it accumulates like the ice and snow of Kunlun’s yin peaks, enduring the three *fu* (hottest periods) without melting. Though the heart’s *gang* of earth serves as a barrier and guardian, when spirit is vigorous, all is well; when spirit wanes, danger arises. The ancients understood this and devised the secret of "gathering spirit to warm the passes," though it is rarely heard in the world. Only Mistress Feng, who knew and practiced it with verification, recorded it in her poetry—hence its selection here as proof.

Yet Mistress Feng’s careful practice and verification relied first upon the secret of "emptying and stilling the mind." Only by emptying and stilling the mind could spirit return and *qi* flourish. Combined with the method of "channeling the stream and kneading the chambers," the *niye* was melted and surged forth from the passes, flowing abundantly to be refined. Thus, the wondrous interplay of presence and absence was achieved!

**Further Note:** The left chamber of the breast connects to the liver, the right to the lungs; the "stream" connects to the heart, kidneys, and spleen—hence the need for constant observation. Yet in ordinary times, one need only maintain it with intention, whether conscious or not. For a woman’s life-root is rooted in the heart, corresponding to the middle line of the *Kun* hexagram, which forms *Li* and harbors true fire. Yet blood is born of coolness, and when blood is abundant, spirit is at peace—thus, the emphasis on emptiness and stillness. This is the crucial ground for curing illness, nurturing life, recovering original vitality, and attaining the Dao. The practice of the *Qingjing Jing*’s "Three Observations" is most effective here.]

**Seventh Rule of the Proper Path for Women’s Cultivation: "Jade Fluid"**

This refers to the man who begins with purity and stillness. When his practice reaches the stage of circulating the river chariot, true essence is preserved in full, not leaking from the mysterious pass. Reversing its flow, it ascends to the crown, where dew descends like rain into the heavenly valley, flowing down to the flower pool—this is also called "jade fluid." Yet when the yin spirit manifests, the hun soul wanders the jade palace, the po soul pays homage to the imperial truth, a halo of light crowns the head, tides surge in the mysterious sea, and echoes resound in the jade purity—this is the true return of the elixir of jade fluid. The ancient perfected ones called it "the pouring of ghee upon the crown."

As for the jade fluid of women, it is the red dragon’s fluid transformed into the white phoenix’s marrow. Only when this marrow is abundant can one proceed with the reverse flow, avoiding empty practice. Though the method does not depart from the four rules previously shown, its subtleties must follow the six rules. Only thus can its uses be inexhaustible—just as the ancients said:

*"One grain after another,
Its use knows no end.
When the true seed is attained,
This work must still be pursued with vigor."*

Yet the means of attaining sufficiency and success all stem from mastering the emptying and stilling of the mind. Let the practitioner take heed.

[**Note:** For this rule, let us cite the self-account of the Immortal Jade Maiden:

*"In my past practice of returning the elixir, I began by forgetting the person through the method, forgetting the method itself. When the time came, I acted—thus, I forgot the self for the sake of the Dao. From this day onward, I forgot the days, forgot the hours, until one day even heaven and earth vanished. After a long while, I suddenly awoke as if from a dream, listening and seeing in stillness—yet utterly forgetting what the matter was. Only a scorching heat like fire remained, and then there appeared a grease like oil (this was the north pole’s aftermath—the red dragon’s fluid transformed into the white phoenix’s marrow). Boundless and without shore, sometimes sounding, sometimes silent like a reed, now flowing, now stopping, now surging, now spraying—at times suspended like a snow-white ribbon, at times pure like an ice-bound lake. The times were not fixed, nor the places; the eyes were not dazzled, nor the spirit wearied. Yet within this, seeing and hearing could still delude the nature. I then admonished myself: ‘Do not be lured by phenomena.’ Suddenly, I realized: ‘Heaven and earth and I are of one body.’ Turning inward to examine myself, I saw that my body was surely the same. If the principle was thus externally, it must also be thus internally—and if thus internally, then surely thus externally. Thereupon, I turned inward to reflect: I had no self. After abiding in stillness for a long time, the self appeared. Yet when I sought to delve deeper, there was no gate or opening. Suddenly, as if awakening from a dream, I felt within my body—at the lower extreme—a scorching heat like moxibustion, sounds like thunder. Wind and tide arose within, and in an instant, they pierced the gate, ascended the spine, passed the pillow, and reached the valley, pouring forth like sweet dew, then falling from the nose."*]

The Celestial Pond brims with water, so abundant that swallowing cannot keep pace. Yet in less than half a morning, the fluid surges into the Southern Ocean, soon flowing to encircle the waist and coil around the navel, smelting and refining. Heaven and earth share one body—externally so, internally so—truly so indeed. At this moment, I simply followed the ordinary sequence, and upon completion of the work, withdrew.”

Such was the immortal’s account, purely a transformation of inner cultivation. One can well imagine that in his daily practice, he must have first devoted himself to emptiness and stillness, then proceeded to forgetfulness and forgetting.

*Here, the author appends this passage to affirm the method as a true technique of inner alchemy.*

**On the Proper Path of Female Cultivation, Eighth Principle: "Embryonic Breathing"**

Embryonic breathing is the supreme Dao, the celestial ladder. After a woman completes the Return of the Elixir, her essence and qi become abundant, her body one with that of a man. Without embryonic breathing, the return to emptiness and nothingness would never come.

This single breath holds boundless efficacy, yet its method of cultivation is most simple. However, not all who practice achieve the same result—great differences arise. Is this determined by the Creator? Even the Creator merely allows things to become what they are.

When one first enters stillness to seek the breath at the nose, there is no thought, no deliberation. Morning and evening thus, one day suddenly touches the ancestral aperture, which opens of itself—neither sought nor rejected. The breath and the nose merge in harmony, vast and boundless, dark and unfathomable. One no longer knows whether the ancestral is the self or the self the ancestral. This single breath through the nose is what the ancient sages called *embryonic breathing*.

Within this aperture, yin and yang, the Five Phases, heaven and earth, and all beings are born. The breath responds to the mechanism of stimulus, naturally forming the six grades of immortals: celestial, aquatic, terrestrial, human, divine, and spectral. The key lies in extreme emptiness and stillness.

Those whose virtue aligns with the True One and cultivate accordingly become Celestial Immortals.
Those whose virtue aligns with the Mysterious One and cultivate accordingly become Aquatic Immortals.
Those whose virtue aligns with the Pure One and cultivate accordingly become Terrestrial Immortals.
Those whose virtue aligns with the Refined One and cultivate accordingly become Human Immortals.
The two lesser vehicles, whose virtue aligns with the Passionate One and cultivate accordingly, become either divine (if inclined toward yang) or spectral (if inclined toward yin).

The attainment of the virtuous cannot be called true immortality. Such differences arise from the mechanism of stimulus and response. Though called heavenly endowment, is it not self-acquired? Practitioners, take heed.

[With reverent attention to this discourse, the art of embryonic respiration is the true supreme Dao, the true ladder to heaven—how could one not strive diligently?]

If we speak of the ninth principle in the proper path of female cultivation, it is titled *"Namo."* For in the great accomplishment of female practice, none surpasses the Bodhisattva. Through ascetic discipline and devoted cultivation, one attains the realization of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. The source of this power lies in the two characters *Namo.* Within these two words is concealed a profound mystery. Only by embodying and guarding this body as the Buddha—like a seven-tiered crystal stupa firmly enshrined upon Mount Putuo—can one proceed. Before the stupa stands a Red Child, the leader of the consciousness aggregate, whom the Bodhisattva allows to wander eastward and southward in search, until after fifty-three pilgrimages, he at last meets the Buddha, and the koan is resolved. Then, relying on the Dragon Girl of the Southern Ocean, she offers the wondrous pearl of freedom, which is shielded by the Purple Bamboo Grove. The White Parrot is left to fly up and down at will. Holding the vase of purity, she inserts a willow branch to gather the natural nectar of sweet dew. Seated steadfastly upon Mount Putuo, she employs the *dhāraṇī* method, placing the syllable *Oṃ* upon the ground of true intent, thus securing the supreme treasure within the fish basket. Reciting *Garuḍa-vadha*, she casts all of *sahā* into the Southern Sea, where waves may surge unceasingly—yet she remains in perfect ease, observing the self in self-liberation.

This great dharma, however, cannot do without the fourth principle of inner work, which must arise moment by moment from the preceding principle. Thus, step by step, one returns to true emptiness and true quiescence. When merit is complete and conduct perfected, one may exchange smiles with the Bodhisattva, serene and at peace as the moon’s reflection. Practitioners, take heed.

[With due caution, this principle wholly transforms function through the mechanism of transformation. It is to be grasped intuitively, not idly discussed. One must only devote oneself earnestly to *Namo*, embodying this body as the Buddha—living, fluid, and unbound by any fixed notion.]

If we speak of the tenth principle in the proper path of female cultivation, it is titled *"Vigilance in Endings."* For women embody the virtue of *kun*, the way of earth—without achievement, yet ever completing what is begun. Thus, they too should assist in nurturing and transforming under the bright sun of civilization. Yet the work still begins with emptiness and quiescence, costing not a coin nor expending a thread of effort. Seated, one achieves it unseen, while virtue merges with the workings of creation—this is healing the world through one’s very being.

The practice relies purely on harmonizing the heart with emptiness and stillness. When the breast is calmed to purity, the celestial realm knows peace. When the womb of earth is unobstructed, villages and towns prosper. When the four limbs flow freely, the four barbarian lands are pacified. Thus, when the body is harmonized, the self is at ease; when the self is at ease, the world is governed. The resonance is immediate: a moment of clarity and harmony yields a moment of true virtue. Though no effect is seen, the effect is inherent.

Yet one must fear that foundational study remains shallow, the Three Fields unaligned—how can one whose own body is unfulfilled possess the capacity to fulfill the world? The secret lies in morning and evening devotion: when others advance by one, advance by a hundred; when others advance by ten, advance by a thousand. Even the foolish will surely become enlightened. Practitioners, take heed.

[With due reverence: This precept was reissued by the Queen Mother of the West to the entire commandery. The Peerless Primordial Sovereign, in obedience to the oral transmission of the Jade Purity Divine Mother, compiled and refined the lesser methods of past teachings to conclude this final precept. Truly, it is an unparalleled canon since the dawn of creation—Lü Dongbin called it the greatest fortune of the cosmos, and the Primordial Sovereign declared it the rightful revival of the Dao’s destiny. Such profound hopes are placed upon later scholars that any who obtain this text are entreated to exhort one another in its study.]
