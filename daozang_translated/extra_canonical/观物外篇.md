**Observations on Things, Outer Chapters**
*(Based primarily on the *Siku Quanshu* edition of Zhang Xingcheng’s *Extended Exegesis on the Outer Chapters of Observations on Things*, supplemented by the *Daoist Canon* version)*

Heaven’s numbers are five, Earth’s numbers are five; combined, they make ten, the completeness of numbers. Heaven transforms from one into four, Earth transforms from one into four. The four possess form, while the one is formless—this is called the ultimate of being and non-being. Heaven’s formal numbers are four, but in function, three are used and one is not; Earth’s formal numbers are four, but in function, three are used and one is not. Thus, the formless one models the natural, the unused one models the Dao, and the three that are used model Heaven, Earth, and humanity.

The formal [aspects] undergo eight changes, the functional [aspects] undergo six changes. Therefore, in the imagery of the eight trigrams, four remain unchanging, two reverse, and six trigrams transform to become eight. In the imagery of the hexagrams, eight remain unchanging, twenty-eight reverse, and thirty-six changes complete the sixty-four. Thus, lines are limited to six, trigrams exhaust at eight; calculations culminate at thirty-six, and hexagrams reach their limit at sixty-four.

Trigrams are completed in eight, doubled to sixty-four; lines are completed in six; calculations exhaust at thirty-six, and double to three hundred eighty-four. Heaven has four seasons, each season four months, each month forty days—four times four is sixteen, each subtracting one, so a season has three months, a month thirty days. The four seasons are formal numbers; the three months and thirty days are functional numbers. Though the formal numbers comprise four, one is always unused, so the functional numbers halt at three and culminate at nine. Formal numbers are consistently even, hence four and twelve; functional numbers are consistently odd, hence three and nine.

Why is it that large numbers are insufficient while small numbers are always full? Because the great is unseen while the small is visible. Thus, seasons halt at four, months at three, yet days fill to ten. Therefore, a person’s limbs are four while fingers are ten. Heaven manifests in the south and lies hidden in the north, reaching six yet leaving seven. Thus, people know what is before them but are ignorant of what is behind, and overlook what is to the left and right.

Heaven’s formal numbers are four but use three; Earth’s formal numbers are four but use three. Heaven restrains Earth, Earth restrains Heaven, yet restraint lies with Earth, just as the surplus of day resides in night. Thus, Heaven is three and Earth is four. Heaven has the three luminaries, Earth the four phases. Yet Earth’s vastness is both visible and concealed—does this refer to its surplus?

*Qian* has seven offspring, *Dui* six, *Li* five, *Zhen* four, *Xun* three, *Kan* two, *Gen* one, and *Kun*, being wholly yin, has none. *Qian* has seven offspring, *Kun* six, *Dui* five, *Gen* four, *Li* three, *Kan* two, *Zhen* one, and *Xun*, being rigid, has none.

Heaven has two correct [positions], Earth has two correct [positions], and together they employ two changes to form the eight trigrams. Heaven has four correct [positions], Earth has four correct [positions], and together they employ twenty-eight changes to form the sixty-four hexagrams. Thus, in the lesser completion of trigrams, four are correct and two change, totaling six trigrams. In the greater completion of hexagrams, eight are correct and twenty-eight change, totaling thirty-six hexagrams.

*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are the ancestors of the thirty-six hexagrams; *Dui*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, and *Gen* are the ancestors of the twenty-eight hexagrams. *Qian* and *Kun* undergo seven changes, so the extremes of day and night do not exceed seven divisions. *Gen* and *Dui* undergo six changes, so the moon halts at six, totaling twelve. *Li* and *Kan* undergo five changes, so the sun halts at five, totaling ten days. *Zhen* and *Xun* undergo four changes, so forms halt at four, totaling eight.

The correct and changing hexagrams together number thirty-six, while the lines further comprise two hundred sixteen—these are the functional calculations. Thirty-six minus four is thirty-two; minus another four is twenty-eight; minus another four is twenty-four. Thus, the number of hexagrams is thirty-two positions, expressed by subtracting four; Heaven’s numbers are twenty-eight positions, expressed by subtracting eight; Earth’s numbers are twenty-four positions, expressed by subtracting twelve.

The four are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*; the eight include *Yi*, *Zhongfu*, *Da Guo*, and *Xiao Guo*; the twelve include *Dui*, *Zhen*, *Tai*, and *Jiji*. The sun has eight positions but uses only seven, expressed by subtracting *Qian*. The moon has eight positions but uses only six, expressed by subtracting *Dui*. The stars have eight positions but use only five, expressed by subtracting *Li*. The celestial stems have eight positions but use only four, expressed by subtracting *Zhen*. The sun has eight positions, yet its number halts at seven, expressed by subtracting *Tai*.

The moon begins with *Dui* because the moon cannot match the sun’s numbers, so the twelve months always leave twelve days. *Qian* is yang within yang and cannot change, so a year is only reckoned in twelve months. *Zhen* is yin within yang and cannot change, so the twelve hours of a day are not visible. *Dui* is yang within yin, *Li* is yin within yang, and both can change, so the numbers of the sun and moon can be divided.

Thus, yin numbers begin with twelve, yang numbers with thirty, always preserving two sixes. Taking the year to see the months, the months to see the days, the days to see the hours—yang governs yin. Thus, Heaven’s four changes contain Earth’s four changes; the sun’s changes contain the changes of the moon and stars. Therefore, one hexagram contains four hexagrams. The sun occupies one position, the moon one position, the stars one position, the celestial stems one position.

The sun has four positions, the moon has four positions, the stars have four positions, and the celestial stems have four positions. Four fours make sixteen positions. With this one change, the numbers of the sun and moon are exhausted. Heaven has four changes, Earth has four changes; changes have growth and decline. Sixteen changes exhaust the numbers of Heaven and Earth.

The sun begins with one, the moon with two, the stars with three, and the celestial stems with four. Extending this, yang numbers are always six, yin numbers always two, and the cycles of the great and small are exhausted. Three hundred sixty changes make twelve myriad nine thousand six hundred. Twelve myriad nine thousand six hundred changes make one hundred sixty-seven billion nine thousand six hundred sixteen myriad. One hundred sixty-seven billion nine thousand six hundred sixteen myriad changes make twenty-eight thousand two hundred eleven trillion nine hundred ninety myriad seven thousand four hundred fifty-six billion.

Taking three hundred sixty as the measure of an hour, twelve myriad nine thousand six hundred as the measure of a day, one hundred sixty-seven billion nine thousand six hundred sixteen myriad as the measure of a month, and twenty-eight thousand two hundred eleven trillion nine hundred ninety myriad seven thousand four hundred fifty-six billion as the measure of a year, the numbers of the great and small cycles are established. Dividing twenty-eight thousand two hundred eleven trillion nine hundred ninety myriad seven thousand four hundred fifty-six billion into twelve, the first six divisions are growth, the latter six are decline, corresponding to the twelve months of a year, advancing or retreating three hundred sixty days.

Dividing one hundred sixty-seven billion nine thousand six hundred sixteen myriad into thirty corresponds to the thirty days of a month, advancing or retreating sixty days in accordance with the waxing and waning of the great cycle. Dividing twelve myriad nine thousand six hundred into twelve corresponds to the twelve hours of a day, advancing or retreating six days. Three hundred sixty corresponds to the measure of an hour, following the advance and retreat of the small cycle to match the times of day and night.

Of the sixteen changes, removing the intersecting numbers and taking the usable numbers yields twenty-eight thousand two hundred eleven trillion nine hundred ninety myriad seven thousand four hundred fifty-six billion. Dividing this into twelve divisions, the first six are growth, the latter six are decline; each division contains thirteen billion nine thousand nine hundred sixty-eight myriad of one hundred sixty-seven billion nine thousand six hundred sixteen myriad. For every one hundred sixty-seven billion nine thousand six hundred sixteen myriad years, one division opens, advancing sixty days. Six divisions open six parts, advancing three hundred sixty days. There remains one part, so seven divisions open, advancing three hundred sixty-six days. The retreat follows the same pattern.

Of twelve myriad nine thousand six hundred, removing three—the intersecting numbers—and taking seven—the usable numbers—three usable numbers form six, and with the remainder, there are seven. Seven yields nine myriad seven hundred twenty years; halving it yields forty-five thousand three hundred sixty years, advancing six days. A day has day and night, numbers have waxing and waning, completing twelve days. Every three thousand six hundred years, one day advances; in forty-three thousand two hundred years, twelve days advance. The remaining two thousand one hundred sixty years advance the six remainder days, combined with the intersecting two thousand one hundred sixty years, together advancing twelve divisions to form intercalary days. Thus, the changes of the small cycle complete three hundred sixty-six days in sixty changes.

Six represents the Three Heavens, four the Two Earths. Heaven governs the essence and relies on Earth as its form; Earth divides the function and follows Heaven as its use. Heaven and Earth depend on each other, essence and function adhere to one another. *Qian* is one; the fifth line of *Qian* divides to form *Dayou*, corresponding to the number three hundred sixty. The fourth line of *Qian* divides to form *Xiaoxu*, corresponding to the number twelve myriad nine thousand six hundred. The third line of *Qian* divides to form *Lü*, corresponding to the number one hundred sixty-seven billion nine thousand six hundred sixteen myriad. The second line of *Qian* divides to form *Tongren*, corresponding to the number twenty-eight thousand two hundred eleven trillion nine hundred ninety myriad seven thousand four hundred fifty-six billion. The first line of *Qian* divides to form *Gou*, corresponding to the number seven *ti* nine thousand five hundred eighty-six myriad six thousand one hundred ten *gai* nine thousand nine hundred forty-six myriad four thousand eight *jing* eight thousand four hundred thirty-nine myriad one thousand nine hundred thirty-six *zhao*.

These are called the divided numbers. Dividing the great into the small proceeds from above downward, thus corresponding to yang numbers. One generates two as *Guai*, corresponding to the number twelve. Two generates four as *Dazhuang*, corresponding to the number four thousand three hundred twenty. Four generates eight as *Tai*, corresponding to the number five hundred fifty-nine million eight hundred seventy-two thousand. Eight generates sixteen as *Lin*, corresponding to the number nine hundred forty trillion three thousand six hundred ninety-nine myriad sixty-nine thousand one hundred fifteen billion two thousand myriad. Sixteen generates thirty-two as *Fu*, corresponding to the number two thousand six hundred fifty-two myriad eight thousand eight hundred seventy *gai* three thousand six hundred sixty-four myriad eight thousand eight hundred *jing* two thousand nine hundred forty-seven myriad nine thousand seven hundred thirty-one *zhao* two thousand myriad billion. Thirty-two generates sixty-four as *Kun*, corresponding to the number of the infinite.

These are called the extended numbers. Extending the great into the small proceeds from below upward, thus corresponding to yin numbers. Heaven governs the essence, so eight changes culminate in sixteen.

The earth divides its function, thus six changes culminate in twelve. Heaven begins with one and ends with seven *ti* nine thousand five hundred eighty-six myriad sixty-one hundred ten *gai* nine thousand nine hundred forty-six myriad four thousand eight *jing* eight thousand four hundred thirty-nine myriad one thousand nine hundred thirty-six *zhao*. Earth begins with twelve and ends with two hundred four *gai* six thousand nine hundred eighty myriad seven thousand three hundred eighty-one *jing* five thousand four hundred ninety-three myriad eight thousand four hundred ninety-nine *zhao* seven hundred twenty myriad billion.

Only with earth does two arise, and only with two do day and night emerge. Two and three transform, interweaving to form, thus the *Yi* generates numbers from two, changes through twelve, yet one is not a number—though not a number, numbers are completed through it. The heavens move without cease, never knowing day or night; humans dwell upon the earth and thus conceive day and night, so the numbers of the earth’s surface serve human use.

From *Lin* upward in heaven and *Shi* upward in earth, these are the numbers of *yun* (cosmic movement). From *Tongren* downward in heaven and *Dun* downward in earth, these are the numbers of *nian* (years). The numbers of *yun* belong to heaven; the numbers of *nian* belong to earth. From *Bi* upward in heaven and *Gen* upward in earth, these are the numbers of *yong* (function). From *Mingyi* downward in heaven and *Pi* downward in earth, these are the numbers of *jiao* (interaction). From *Zhen* upward in heaven and *Jin* upward in earth, these are the numbers of *you* (existence). From *Yi* downward in heaven and *Yu* downward in earth, these are the numbers of *wu* (non-existence).

Heaven’s numbers begin with *Qian* and end with *Zhen*, the remainder entering into non-existence, for the celestial stems are not manifest. Earth, subtracting one, begins with twelve, for earth’s fire constantly lies concealed. Thus heaven takes *ti* (essence) as its foundation yet constantly conceals that foundation, while earth takes *yong* (function) as its root yet constantly hides that function.

One season ends at three months, one month ends at thirty days—both omit their *chen* (stem-branch) numbers. Therefore, among the sixty-four hexagrams of eight eights, eight remain unchanged, while seven are mutable. Seven times eight is fifty-six, its principle also deriving from this.

Yang lines correspond to day numbers, yin lines to night numbers. Heaven and earth interlock, yin and yang intersect, thus day and night intermingle, hardness and softness alternate. In spring and summer, yang is abundant, so day numbers exceed night numbers; in autumn and winter, yin is abundant, so day numbers are fewer than night numbers.

The *ce* (counting rods) of *ti* numbers total three hundred eighty-four; subtracting the *ce* of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* yields the *yong* numbers: three hundred sixty. The *yong* of *ti* numbers is two hundred seventy; subtracting the *ce* of *Qian*, *Kan*, and *Li* yields the *yong* of *yong* numbers: two hundred fifty-two. Of the *yong* of *ti* numbers (two hundred seventy), one hundred fifty-six are yang, and one hundred fourteen are yin. Subtracting the *ce* of *Li* yields one hundred fifty-two yang and one hundred twelve yin—these are the actual *yong* numbers. For yang discards *Li* and employs *Qian*, while yin discards *Kun* and employs *Kan*.

Thus heaven’s yang *ce* number one hundred twelve, earth’s yin *ce* number one hundred twelve, and the yang *ce* forty—subtracting the yang of north and south. At the extreme south is great heat, at the extreme north great cold, where things cannot grow, hence they are omitted. Are the forty the surplus of heaven? Yang encroaches upon yin, day encroaches upon night, thus they belong to earth. Combined, these yield one hundred fifty-two yang and one hundred twelve yin.

Subtracting the *ce* of *Qian* from yang and *Kan* from yin yields one hundred forty-six yang and one hundred eight yin—these are the *yong* of *yong* numbers. Thirty-six yang, multiplied by three, becomes one hundred eight; thirty-six yin, multiplied by three, becomes one hundred eight. Three yang and three yin—yin and yang are evenly divided. With one surplus part of yang as thirty-six, combined they yield one hundred forty-six yang and one hundred eight yin.

Thus the *yong* of *ti* numbers is two hundred seventy, while the actual *yong* is three hundred sixty-four, and the *yong* of *yong* numbers is two hundred fifty-two. The hexagrams number sixty-four yet are employed only up to thirty-six; the lines number three hundred eighty-four yet are employed only up to two hundred sixteen.

Sixty-four divided yields two hundred fifty-six, so removing the initial and top lines of one hexagram also yields two hundred fifty-six—these are the numbers of generating life. Thus *Li* and *Kan* govern the generation of life, for *Li* has four yang and *Kan* four yin, so that which generates life must be four. One hundred twelve yang and one hundred twelve yin—subtracting the lines of *Li* and *Kan* yields two hundred sixteen. The forty of yin and yang together make two hundred fifty-six.

Therefore, the eight trigrams employ six lines, governed by *Qian* and *Kun*. Six lines employ four positions, governed by *Li* and *Kan*. Thus heaven’s dawn and dusk do not generate life, but midday does; earth’s north and south do not generate life, but the center does.

What are *ti* numbers for? They generate life. What are *yong* numbers for? They govern movement. Movement belongs to heaven, generation of life to earth. Heaven moves alone, thus its *yong* numbers multiply among themselves, and the *yong* of *yong* numbers becomes the time for generating life. Earth generates in pairs, thus the *yong* of *ti* numbers—yang multiplied by yin—becomes the number for generating life.

Heaven’s number is three, thus six times six and again six—hence *Qian*’s *ce* is two hundred sixteen. Earth’s number is two, thus twelve times twelve—hence *Kun*’s *ce* is one hundred forty-four. *Qian* employs nine, so three times eight is twenty-four, and nine times that is two hundred sixteen; two times eight is sixteen, and nine times that is one hundred forty-four.

Kun employs six, thus three times twelve is thirty-six, and six times that is likewise two hundred sixteen; two times twelve is twenty-four, and six times that is likewise one hundred forty-four. Kun takes three from twelve, four from sixteen, one and a half from six, as the surplus portions of Qian, so Qian obtains two hundred fifty-two, and Kun obtains one hundred eight.

The four yang hexagrams have twelve lines—eight yang and four yin—multiplying the yang by thirty-six and the yin by twenty-four yields three hundred eighty-four. The *ti* has three hundred eighty-four, yet the *yong* stops at three hundred sixty—why? Because Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are not employed. Why are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li not employed? It is because the non-employment of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li completes the *yong* of three hundred sixty. Thus the myriad things transform and change, yet these four do not change. Precisely because they do not change, they are able to effect change.

The *yong* stops at three hundred sixty, yet there are three hundred sixty-six—why? It is the fullness of numbers. What use is the fullness of numbers? It is the complete *yong* of Qian. When Qian and Kun are not employed, Kan and Li are used by half. Why is Qian fully employed? Because yang governs fullness. Why are Qian and Kun not employed? Because solitary yang does not generate, and solitary yin does not complete. Why are Li and Kan used by half? Because Li is in the east and Kan in the west, standing at the midpoint of yin and yang, serving as the gates of spring-autumn and day-night.

Sometimes Qian is employed, sometimes Li and Kan—why? Speaking in terms of yang, Qian is employed; speaking in terms of surplus portions, yang encroaches upon yin, day encroaches upon night, thus Li and Kan are employed. Yang governs surplus, hence Qian is fully employed. Yin governs emptiness, hence Kun is entirely unused. Yang encroaches upon yin, yin encroaches upon yang, thus Li and Kan are used by half. Therefore, the heavens’ south is fully visible while the north is fully invisible, and east and west are each half. Li and Kan are the limits of yin and yang, thus Li corresponds to *yin*, Kan to *shen*, yet the numbers always exceed them—this is the overflow of yin and yang. Nevertheless, the *yong* numbers do not surpass *yin*, and the intersecting numbers do not surpass *shen*.

Qian is forty-eight, divided into four parts, one part is overcome by yin; Kun is forty-eight, divided into four parts, one part is the yang that overcomes it. Thus Qian obtains thirty-six, and Kun obtains twelve. Yang governs advance, hence advancing makes three hundred sixty days; yin governs diminution, hence the twelve months diminish twelve days.

Counting in sequence: Qian one, Dui two, Li three, Zhen four, Xun five, Kan six, Gen seven, Kun eight. Counting in reverse: Zhen one, Li and Dui two, Qian three, Xun four, Kan and Gen five, Kun six. Qian forty-eight, Dui thirty, Li twenty-four, Zhen ten, Kun twelve, Gen twenty, Kan thirty-six, Xun forty. Qian thirty-six, Kun twelve, Li, Dui, and Xun twenty-eight, Kan, Gen, and Zhen twenty.

Consider further the alignment of Li above. The circular number has one, the square number has two—this is the meaning of odd and even. Six is one, twelve is two. Heaven is round and earth is square; the round begins with one and accumulates to six; the square begins with one and accumulates to eight. When transformed, it begins with four and accumulates to twelve. The six always transforms by six, the eight always transforms by eight, and the twelve also transforms by eight—this is the natural Dao.

Eight is the *ti* of heaven and earth, six is the *yong* of heaven and earth, twelve is the *yong* of earth. Heaven transforms the square into the round yet always preserves its one; earth divides one into four yet always holds to its square. Heaven changes its *ti* but does not change its *yong*; earth changes its *yong* but does not change its *ti*. The six combines its one to become seven; the twelve combines its four to become sixteen. Yang governs advance, hence heaven combines its one to become seven; yin governs retreat, hence earth removes its four and stops at twelve. Thus yang always preserves one while yin always obscures one, so the *ti* of heaven and earth stops at eight, the *yong* of heaven culminates at seven, and the *yong* of earth stops at twelve.

The round wears away the square for its *yong*, thus one transforms into four, and removing one from four leaves three; three transforms into nine, and removing three from nine leaves six. The square extends the round for its *ti*, thus one transforms into three, combining to make four; four transforms into twelve, combining to make sixteen. Thus the *yong* numbers are completed at three and culminate at six, the *ti* numbers are completed at four and culminate at sixteen.

Therefore, the round has a diameter of one and a circumference of three, beginning with one and accumulating to six; the square divides one into four, and divides four into sixteen—all is the natural Dao. One employs two to generate three, and removing one from three leaves two. Three generates nine, removing one from nine leaves eight, and removing three leaves six. Thus one employs three, and three in turn employs two; three employs nine, and nine in turn employs eight and six. Therefore, two generates four, eight generates sixteen, and six generates twelve. Three combines with one to make four, nine combines with three to make twelve, and twelve further combines with four to make sixteen.

Thus four takes one as its root and three as its *yong*; twelve takes three as its root and nine as its *yong*; sixteen takes four as its root and twelve as its *yong*. Six transforms to become thirty-six, eight transforms to become sixty-four, and twelve transforms to become one hundred fourteen.

Six transformed six times yields three hundred eighty-four. Eight transformed eight times—sixty-four transformations—also yields three hundred eighty-four. The circular undergoes six transformations; advancing by sixes, sixty transformations yield three hundred sixty. The square undergoes eight transformations; thus eight times eight yields sixty-four. Yang governs advancement, hence the progression to sixty. Why does the milfoil count not use six but seven? It incorporates the remainder. Removing the remainder leaves six, hence the tally number is thirty-six. Thus fifty is the tally for the sixty-four hexagrams in an intercalary year, while forty-nine is used for the sixty hexagrams in a common year. The "returning of the surplus and hanging of the one" is like the intercalary month in a year. Why are four removed from the hexagrams? Heaven changes, and Earth responds in kind. Thus when the milfoil removes one, the hexagrams remove four.

The circular has a diameter of one and a circumference of three; doubled, it becomes six. The square has a diameter of one and a circumference of four; doubled, it becomes eight. The *Yi* begins with three lines—the application of the circular, with a diameter of one and a circumference of three; doubled, it becomes six, hence the six lines. The *Yi* begins with four images—the form of the square, with a diameter of one and a circumference of four; doubled, it becomes eight, hence the eight trigrams. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all have four in their forms and three in their functions. The sages composed the *Yi* to reveal the principles of nature to people.

Cutting the square to form the circle mirrors the movements of Heaven; dividing the great into the small mirrors the transformations of Earth. Thus Heaven employs six transformations, and Earth employs four. One and eight make nine; cut to seven; eight cut to six; sixteen cut to twelve; twenty-four cut to eighteen; thirty-two cut to twenty-four; forty cut to thirty; forty-eight cut to thirty-six; fifty-six cut to forty-two; sixty-four cut to forty-eight.

One divides into four, eight into thirty-two, sixteen into sixty-four, extending to ninety-six dividing into three hundred eighty-four. One generates six, six generates twelve, twelve generates eighteen, eighteen generates twenty-four, twenty-four generates thirty, thirty generates thirty-six; extending this, sixty transformations generate three hundred sixty—this is the number of movement. Four generates twelve, twelve generates twenty, twenty generates twenty-eight, twenty-eight generates thirty-six—this is the number of living things.

Thus Qian’s yang tally is thirty-six; Li and Xun’s yang tally is twenty-eight; Kan and Gen’s yang tally is twenty; and Kun’s yang tally is twelve. In the circular, one transformation generates six, removing one leaves five. Two transformations generate twelve, removing two leaves ten. Three transformations generate eighteen, removing three leaves fifteen. Four transformations yield twenty-four, removing four leaves twenty. Five transformations yield thirty, removing five leaves twenty-five. Six transformations yield thirty-six, removing six leaves thirty. Thus retaining it yields six by six, and removing it yields five by five. Five retains one from four, four retains one from three, three retains one from two, two retains one from one.

Thus one generates two, removing one leaves one; two generates three, removing one leaves two; three generates four, removing one leaves three; four generates five, removing one leaves four. Therefore, two takes one as its root, three takes two as its root, four takes three as its root, five takes four as its root, and six takes five as its root.

Reflect further: the square undergoes one transformation to become four; four generates eight, combining four yields twelve; eight generates twelve, combining eight yields twenty; twelve generates sixteen, combining twelve yields twenty-eight; sixteen generates twenty, combining sixteen yields thirty-six. One generates three, combining yields four; twelve generates twenty, combining yields thirty-two; twenty-eight generates thirty-six, combining yields sixty-four.

What is the great expansion in the *Yi*? It is the number upon which the sages relied. The heavenly numbers total twenty-five, combined as fifty; the earthly numbers total thirty, combined as sixty. Thus it is said, "The five positions interact and each has its correspondence." Fifty is the milfoil number; sixty is the hexagram number. Five is the minor expansion of the milfoil, hence fifty is the great expansion. The eight trigrams are the minor completion of the hexagrams, thus sixty-four is the great completion.

The milfoil’s virtue is circular, modeling the numbers of Heaven, hence seven times seven is forty-nine. Fifty retains one in its expression. The hexagram’s virtue is square, modeling the numbers of Earth, hence eight times eight is sixty-four. Sixty removes four in its expression. The milfoil is the number of application; the hexagram is the number of form. Application takes form as its foundation, hence it retains one; form takes application as its root, hence it removes four. The circular is rooted in one; the square is rooted in four. Thus the milfoil retains one while the hexagrams remove four.

The milfoil’s applied number is seven, as its remainder also embodies the principle of retaining one; "hanging the one" likewise embodies retaining one. The milfoil’s applied number, "hanging one to symbolize three," leaves forty-eight as the tally for one hexagram. Four times twelve is forty-eight. Twelve minus three is nine for application; four times thirty-two are the removed tallies, four times nine is thirty-six, the applied tallies, corresponding to Qian’s thirty-six yang lines.

Twelve minus five yields seven for application; four times five is twenty, the removed tallies; four times seven is twenty-eight, the applied tallies, corresponding to Dui and Li’s twenty-eight yang lines. Twelve minus six yields six for application; four times six is twenty-four, the removed tallies; four times six is twenty-four, the applied tallies, corresponding to Kun’s twenty-four yin lines. Twelve minus four yields eight for application; four times four is sixteen, the removed tallies; four times eight is thirty-two, the applied tallies, corresponding to Kan and Gen’s twenty-four yin lines, combined with the upper hexagram’s eight yin lines to make thirty-two.

Thus, seven and nine are yang; six and eight are yin. Nine is the utmost number of yang; six is the utmost number of yin. When numbers reach their extremity, they reverse, hence the changes in hexagrams. Zhen and Xun have no tallies, for they correspond to unused numbers. Heaven’s virtue is hardness, so the soft is not manifest; Earth’s body is softness, so the hard does not arise—thus Zhen and Xun have no tallies. Qian employs nine, so its tally is nine. The fourfold multiplication corresponds to the four seasons, each season having ninety days. Kun employs six, so its tally is also six.

There are four odd numbers: one, two, three, and four; four tally numbers: six, seven, eight, and nine. Together they make eight numbers, corresponding to the eight changes of the eight directions. The numbers of the combined remainders in hexagram formation are six: five and four fours; nine and eight eights; five and four eights; nine and four eights; five and eight eights; nine and four fours. These correspond to the six changes of the circular numbers.

Odd numbers culminate at four, and five is unused; tally numbers culminate at nine, and ten is unused. Five is one; ten is two—thus five and ten are discarded, and four and nine are employed. Odd numbers do not use five; tally numbers do not use ten—this is the extremity of presence and absence, likened to the numbers of nature.

Why are there sixty-four hexagrams yet only sixty are used? The sixty hexagrams comprise three hundred sixty lines, hence the *jiazi* cycle ends at sixty. After six *jia* cycles, the Dao of Heaven is exhausted. Thus the tally numbers correspond to thirty-six and twenty-four, which together make sixty; thirty-two and twenty-eight also together make sixty.

Qian has forty-eight; Kun has twelve; Zhen has twenty; Xun has forty; Li and Dui have thirty-two; Kan and Gen have twenty-eight—together they make sixty. The milfoil’s numbers are complete, so the yang tallies thirty-six and twenty-eight together make sixty-four. The hexagram numbers discard four, so the yin tallies twenty-four and thirty-two together make fifty-six.

Nine advancing becomes thirty-six, all yang numbers, thus it is yang within yang; seven advancing becomes twenty-eight, yang preceding yin, thus it is yang within yin; six advancing becomes twenty-four, all yin numbers, thus it is yin within yin; eight advancing becomes thirty-two, yin preceding yang, thus it is yin within yang.

Four advancements of the milfoil make one hundred; four advancements of the hexagrams make one hundred twenty. One hundred is ten; one hundred twenty is twelve. When the combined remainders in hexagram formation yield five and four fours, the tally number is four nines; when they yield nine and eight eights, the tally number is four sixes; when they yield five and eight eights or nine and four eights, the tally numbers are both four sevens; when they yield nine and four fours or five and four eights, the tally numbers are both four eights.

The formation of nine requires one change to correspond to Qian; the formation of six requires one change to correspond to Kun; the formation of seven requires two changes to correspond to Dui and Li; the formation of eight requires two changes to correspond to Gen and Kan.

Five and four fours, subtracting the "hanging one" number, yield four thirty-twos; nine and eight eights, subtracting the "hanging one" number, yield four twenty-fours; five and eight eights or nine and four eights, subtracting the "hanging one" number, yield four twenties; nine and four fours or five and four eights, subtracting the "hanging one" number, yield four sixteens. Thus the numbers three, four, five, and six are discarded to form the tallies nine, eight, seven, and six.

Heaven is one, Earth is two; Heaven is three, Earth is four; Heaven is five, Earth is six; Heaven is seven, Earth is eight; Heaven is nine, Earth is ten—interweaving and varying, their numbers crisscross like Heaven and Earth interlocking, day and night alternating.

One is the beginning of numbers yet not a number itself, thus two twos make four, three threes make nine, four fours make sixteen, five fives make twenty-five, six sixes make thirty-six, seven sevens make forty-nine, eight eights make sixty-four, nine nines make eighty-one, yet one cannot be transformed. One hundred is ten; ten is one—these also cannot be transformed. Thus numbers discard one and culminate at nine, all employing their changes.

Five fives are twenty-five, the number of Heaven; six sixes are thirty-six, the tally of Qian; seven sevens are forty-nine, the applied number of the *Dayan*; eight eights are sixty-four, the number of hexagrams; nine nines are eighty-one, the number of the *Xuan* and *Fan*. Is the number of the *Dayan* the source of calculation methods? Thus the origin of calculation lies in nothing more than squares, circles, curves, and straight lines. Multiplication generates numbers; division diminishes them.

Though calculation methods may be numerous, they do not exceed these principles. Yin has no one; yang has no ten. Yang attains yin and generates; yin attains yang and completes. Thus, the milfoil numbers are four and nine, while the hexagram numbers are six and ten—just as the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches interweave, the Stems conclude at six and the Branches at five.

Three fours are twelve; two sixes are also twelve. Doubling twelve yields twenty-four; three eights are also twenty-four, as are four sixes. Tripling twelve yields thirty-six; four nines are also thirty-six, as are six sixes. Quadrupling twelve yields forty-eight; tripling sixteen is also forty-eight, as are six eights. Quintupling twelve yields sixty; tripling twenty is also sixty, as are six tens. All these are natural correspondences.

Four nines are thirty-six, and six sixes are thirty-six. Yang’s six incorporates half of yin’s six, hence nine. Thus, in terms of two hexagrams, yin and yang each have three; in terms of six lines, Heaven, Earth, and Humanity each have two. Within yin and yang, there are Heaven, Earth, and Humanity; within Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, there are yin and yang. Hence, the numbers rely on "three of Heaven and two of Earth."

Yang’s number is one, extended to ten—such are the Ten Heavenly Stems. Yin’s number is two, extended to twelve—such are the Twelve Earthly Branches, the twelve months. One change yields two; two changes yield four; three changes yield the eight trigrams. Four changes yield sixteen; five changes yield thirty-two; six changes complete the sixty-four hexagrams. The *Yi* has a true number—three alone. "Three of Heaven" means three threes make nine; "two of Earth" means doubling three makes six. "Three of Heaven and two of Earth" form the derived numbers, not the correct numbers of Heaven and Earth. "Derived" means modeled—modeled after the correct numbers of Heaven and Earth to generate them.

The generative numbers of the *Yi* total 129,600, summing to 4,320 generations. This is the great number of waxing and waning, the extended number of thirty years’ celestial cycles—precisely this number. A year has 360 days, yielding 4,320 celestial cycles; multiplying by thirty gives this number. All *jiazi* and *jiawu* mark the beginnings of generations. These are the numbers of *Jingshi*, commencing with the day *jia*, month *zi*, star *jia*, and celestial cycle *zi*. It is also said: these are the numbers of *Jingshi* for the day *jia*, with the month *zi*, star *jia*, and celestial cycle *zi* following.

One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, and hundred million are the derived numbers of Heaven. Twelve, one hundred twenty, one thousand two hundred, twelve thousand, and one hundred twenty thousand are the paired numbers of Earth. Dividing by five yields ten; if "three of Heaven and two of Earth" are applied, it yields six; doubling Earth’s two yields four. These are the numbers of Heaven and Earth dividing the Supreme Ultimate.

From *Fu* to *Qian*, there are one hundred twelve yang lines; from *Gou* to *Kun*, there are eighty yang lines. From *Gou* to *Kun*, there are one hundred twelve yin lines; from *Fu* to *Qian*, there are eighty yin lines. Yang numbers exceed three hundred sixty; yin numbers fall short of three hundred sixty. Humanity is the spirit of the myriad things, lodged in the category of movement. Movement is yin, hence one hundred twenty. There are beings of a day, a month, an hour, a year, a decade, and up to hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands—all exist. Heaven and Earth are also things, and they too have their numbers.

The inverse and opposite hexagrams all consist of six yin and six yang lines. In the *Yi*, the six-yang and six-yin hexagrams number twelve pairs. Excluding the four cardinal hexagrams, there are eight-yang and four-yin, or eight-yin and four-yang, each numbering six pairs; ten-yang and two-yin, or ten-yin and two-yang, each numbering three pairs. The round pertains to the stars—do the numbers of calendrical reckoning originate here? The square pertains to earth—do the methods of dividing lands and fields imitate this? The round represents the numbers of the *Hetu*; the square, the patterns of the *Luoshu*. Thus, Fuxi and King Wen followed them to create the *Yi*; Yu and Ji Xu arranged them to compose the *Fan*.

Once the Supreme Ultimate divides, the Two Modes are established. Yang descends to intersect with yin; yin ascends to intersect with yang—thus the Four Images are born. Yang intersects with yin, and yin with yang, generating Heaven’s Four Images; hardness intersects with softness, and softness with hardness, generating Earth’s Four Images—thereupon the eight trigrams are complete. The eight trigrams intermingle, and then the myriad things are born.

Thus, one divides into two, two into four, four into eight, eight into sixteen, sixteen into thirty-two, and thirty-two into sixty-four. Hence it is said: "Dividing yin and dividing yang, alternately employing softness and hardness, the *Yi*’s six positions thus form a pattern." Ten divides into a hundred, a hundred into a thousand, a thousand into ten thousand—like roots having trunks, trunks having branches, branches having leaves: the larger they grow, the fewer they become; the finer they grow, the more numerous they become. United, they form one; extended, they become ten thousand.

Therefore, *Qian* divides, *Kun* gathers, *Zhen* lengthens, *Xun* diminishes. Lengthening leads to division; division leads to diminution; diminution leads to gathering. *Qian* and *Kun* establish positions; *Zhen* and *Xun* first intersect; *Dui*, *Li*, *Kan*, and *Gen* intersect again. Thus, *Zhen* has little yang and much yin remaining; *Xun* has little yin and much yang remaining; *Dui* and *Li* gradually gain yang; *Kan* and *Gen* gradually gain yin—hence the celestial cycles and fire are not seen.

When the primal qi divides, yin and yang are distinguished. That which obtains more yang becomes Heaven; that which obtains more yin becomes Earth.

Thus, when yin and yang are balanced, form and substance are complete; when yin and yang are biased, nature and disposition diverge. If form and substance further divide, that which has more yang becomes firm, and that which has more yin becomes soft. If nature and disposition further divide, that which has more yang reaches the extreme of yang, and that which has more yin reaches the extreme of yin.

*Dui*, *Li*, and *Xun* obtain more yang; *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Zhen* obtain more yin—thus they serve the functions of Heaven and Earth. *Qian* is the extreme of yang, *Kun* the extreme of yin—thus they do not serve a function. *Qian* divides one-fourth of its yang to give to *Kun*; *Kun* divides one-fourth of its yin to offer to *Qian*. *Qian* and *Kun* each unite to produce the six children: the three sons are all yang, the three daughters all yin. *Dui* divides one yang to give to *Gen*; *Kan* divides one yin to offer to *Li*; *Zhen* and *Xun* exchange two.

Taken together, yin and yang are balanced—thus water and fire give rise to and overcome one another, and only then are the myriad things completed. The names and positions of *Qian* and *Kun* cannot be altered; the names of *Kan* and *Li* may be altered, but their positions cannot; the positions of *Zhen* and *Xun* may be altered, but their names cannot; the names and positions of *Dui* and *Gen* may both be altered.

*Li* resembles *Qian*; *Kan* resembles *Kun*; *Zhong Fu* resembles *Qian*; *Yi* resembles *Li*; *Xiao Guo* resembles *Kun*; *Da Guo* resembles *Kan*—thus *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhong Fu*, *Yi*, *Da Guo*, and *Xiao Guo* are all unalterable.

*Li* resides in Heaven and corresponds to night—thus within yang there is yin. *Kan* resides on Earth and corresponds to day—thus within yin there is yang. *Zhen* first intersects with yin, and yang is born; *Xun* first diminishes yang, and yin is born. *Dui* is the growth of yang; *Gen* is the growth of yin. *Zhen* and *Dui* are the yin of Heaven; *Xun* and *Gen* are the yang of Earth—thus *Zhen* and *Dui* have yin above and yang below, while *Xun* and *Gen* have yang above and yin below.

From the perspective of incipient generation, Heaven has yin above and yang below—this is the meaning of "interpenetrating harmony." From the perspective of completion, Earth has yang above and yin below—this is the order of honor and humility. *Qian* and *Kun* establish the positions of above and below; *Li* and *Kan* arrange the gates of left and right. Heaven and Earth open and close through them; the sun and moon enter and exit through them. Thus, spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the dark and new moons, the crescent and full moons; the length of day and night; the degrees of celestial motion and their waxing and waning—none do not proceed from this.

From below to above is called ascent; from above to below is called descent. Ascent is generation; descent is diminution. Thus yang is born below, and yin is born above—hence all things are born in reverse. Yin generates yang, yang generates yin; yin again generates yang, yang again generates yin—thus they cycle endlessly.

Yin and yang divide to form the Two Modes; the Two Modes intersect to form the Four Images; the Four Images intersect to form the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams intersect to form the myriad things. Thus, the Two Modes generate the classes of Heaven and Earth; the Four Images determine the forms of Heaven and Earth. The Four Images generate the classes of the sun and moon; the Eight Trigrams determine the forms of the sun and moon. The Eight Trigrams generate the classes of the myriad things; the doubled trigrams determine the forms of the myriad things.

Class is the sequence of generation; form is the intersection of images. To infer class, one must return to generation; to observe form, one must follow images. Generation is to reverse-predict the not-yet-come; images are to sequentially observe the already-formed. Thus, the sun and moon are of one class: they emerge together yet occupy different positions, occupy different positions yet share the same image. Extending this principle, how can things escape it?

Heaven changes with the seasons, and Earth responds with things. In seasons, yin changes and yang responds; in things, yang changes and yin responds. Thus, seasons can be known in reverse, and things must follow to completion. Therefore, yang advances and yin follows; yin moves in reverse and yang follows. In terms of form, Heaven divides to become Earth, Earth divides to become the myriad things—yet the Dao cannot be divided. In the end, the myriad things return to Earth, Earth returns to Heaven, Heaven returns to the Dao. Thus the noble person values the Dao.

Where there is change, there must be response. Thus, change within responds without; change without responds within; change below responds above; change above responds below. Heaven changes, and the sun responds—thus the changing follows Heaven, and the responding models the sun. Therefore, the sun governs the stars; the moon meets the celestial houses; water is born from earth; fire lies hidden in stone; fliers roost in trees; runners rely on grass; the heart and lungs connect; the liver and gallbladder are linked—there is no other reason than the Dao of change and response.

Yang intersects with yin to produce creatures with hooves and horns; the firm intersects with the soft to produce creatures with roots and fibers; yin intersects with yang to produce creatures with feathers and wings; the soft intersects with the firm to produce creatures with branches and trunks. Heaven intersects with Earth, Earth intersects with Heaven—thus there are creatures with feathers that run, and creatures with feet that soar; within grass there is wood, within wood there is grass.

Each may be inferred by its class—thus the generation of things does not exceed this. Runners are suited to below; fliers are suited to above—this follows their class. Things in the land must have counterparts in water, like shadows and reflections. That land has many runners and water many fliers is due to intersection. Thus, what is large on land must be small in water; what is large in water must be small on land. The fur of tigers and leopards resembles grass; the feathers of eagles and hawks resemble wood.

Wood is the child of stars—thus its fruits resemble them. Leaves are yin; flowers and fruits are yang. Branches and leaves are soft; roots and trunks are firm. Humans have large bones and complex bodies; trees have large trunks and complex branches—this accords with the numbers of Heaven and Earth. Moving creatures have horizontal bodies; rooted creatures have vertical bodies. Humans should be horizontal yet are vertical. Fliers have wings; runners have toes. Human hands are wings; human feet are toes. Fliers eat wood; runners eat grass. Humans eat both and also consume fliers and runners—thus they are the most noble among the myriad things.

Bodies must unite to generate life—thus yang and hardness unite to form the heart and lungs; yang and softness unite to form the liver and gallbladder; softness and yin unite to form the kidneys and bladder; hardness and yin unite to form the spleen and stomach. The heart gives rise to the eyes; the gallbladder gives rise to the ears; the spleen gives rise to the mouth; the lungs give rise to the bones; the liver gives rise to the flesh; the stomach gives rise to the marrow; the bladder gives rise to the blood.

Thus, *Qian* corresponds to the heart, *Dui* to the spleen, *Li* to the gallbladder, *Zhen* to the kidneys, *Kun* to the blood, *Gen* to the son, *Kan* to the marrow, *Xun* to the bones, *Tai* to the eyes, *Zhongfu* to the nose, *Jiji* to the ears, *Yi* to the mouth, *Daguo* to the lungs, *Weiji* to the stomach, *Xiaoguo* to the liver, and *Pi* to the bladder.

Heaven and Earth possess eight images, yet humans possess sixteen—why? Because humans are born from the union of Heaven and Earth, just as children are born from the union of father and mother; thus, they possess sixteen images.

The heart resides within the lungs, and the gallbladder resides within the liver—why? Those who speak of nature must return to Heaven; those who speak of form must return to Earth. Within Earth lies Heaven, just as within stone lies fire—thus the heart and gallbladder mirror this.

Why are the heart and gallbladder suspended upside-down? Plants and trees are the body of Earth, and both humans and plants grow in reverse—thus they are suspended upside-down.

Why are the mouth and eyes horizontal while the nose and ears are vertical? Because form must unite. Thus, creatures that move should be vertical yet are horizontal; rooted creatures should be horizontal yet are vertical—all through union.

Heaven has four seasons; Earth has four directions; humans have four limbs. Therefore, the joints of the fingers can reveal Heaven, and the lines of the palm can discern Earth. The principles of Heaven and Earth are fully present in the hand—how can one not hold them in esteem?

The spirit is governed by the heart; qi is governed by the kidneys; form is governed by the head. When form and qi unite, the spirit presides within—this is the Dao of the Three Powers.

The four limbs each possess their own meridians. Each meridian has three sections, and each section has three indicators, corresponding to the numbers of Heaven. The four limbs each have one meridian, reflecting the four seasons. Each meridian has three sections, corresponding to the three months of a season; each section has three indicators, corresponding to the three ten-day periods of a month. Four times nine is thirty-six, the number of *Qian*’s stalks, the supreme number of Heaven.

The *Suwen* states: “The twelve joints all connect to the qi of Heaven.” The twelve joints correspond to the twelve meridians of humans, referring to the three yin and three yang meridians of the hands and feet. The three indicators also correspond to the sinking, floating, and middle states—yin and yang may be excessive or deficient.

The heart stores the spirit; the kidneys store essence; the spleen stores the hun; the gallbladder stores the po. The stomach receives substances and transforms them, transmitting qi to the lungs, blood to the liver, and water and grain to the bladder and intestines.

Heaven is round and Earth is square; Heaven is high in the south and low in the north—thus it appears like an inclined canopy. Yet Earth is low in the southeast and high in the northwest—thus the southeast abounds in water and the northwest in mountains.

Heaven covers Earth, and Earth bears Heaven; Heaven and Earth envelop each other, so there is Earth above and Heaven below. Heaven is vast and unfathomable above, so we observe the Dipper’s movements to divine Heaven. Where the Dipper points is where Heaven moves. The *Kui* points to *zi*, the *Biao* points to *yin*—stars take *yin* as day. The Dipper has seven stars, so daylight does not exceed seven parts.

To elaborate: Heaven’s movement determines day and night; the sun’s movement determines cold and heat. Summer is shallow and winter is deep—this is the union of Heaven and Earth. Leftward rotation and rightward movement—this is the union of Heaven and the sun. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, following Heaven’s movement. In summer it is in the north, in winter in the south, following the union of Heaven and Earth. Heaven completes one revolution and surpasses one star, corresponding to the sun’s movement. Spring aligns with *you*, summer with *wu*, autumn with *mao*, and winter with *zi*—this corresponds to the sun’s union with the seasons.

The sun advances by slowing; the moon retreats by quickening. The sun and moon meet, adding half a day and subtracting half a day—this is how intercalary days arise. The sun completes one great revolution and advances six days; the moon completes one great revolution and retreats six days—this is how intercalary discrepancies arise.

When the sun moves through yang degrees, it is full; when it moves through yin degrees, it is deficient—this is the Dao of host and guest. When the moon moves away from the sun, its light grows and its motion slows; when it nears the sun, its po grows and its motion quickens—this is the principle of ruler and minister.

When yang wanes, yin arises—thus the sun descends and the moon emerges in the west. When yin flourishes, it opposes yang—thus at the full moon, the moon rises in the east.

Heaven is the father, the sun the child—thus Heaven rotates leftward while the sun moves rightward. The sun is the husband, the moon the wife—thus the sun rises in the east while the moon is born in the west.

When the sun and moon eclipse each other, it is the union of their numbers. When the sun faces the moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed—like water and fire overcoming each other.

Thus, the noble employ wisdom while the petty employ force. The sun follows Heaven’s rotation; the moon follows the sun’s movement; the stars appear with the moon—thus the stars follow the moon, the moon follows the sun, and the sun follows Heaven.

Heaven is half bright and half dark; the sun is half full and half deficient; the moon is half full and half waning; the stars are half moving and half still—these are the transformations of yin and yang.

Heaven is always visible day and night; the sun appears by day; the moon appears by night yet is half unseen; the stars are half visible by night—these are the ranks of nobility. The moon can be seen by day, so it is yin within yang. The stars can be seen by night, so they are yang within yin.

Heaven is odd and Earth is even—thus those who divine celestial patterns observe only the stars, while those who examine terrestrial patterns observe only mountains and waters. By observing the stars, the body of Heaven is revealed; by observing mountains and waters, the body of Earth is revealed.

The body of Heaven contains things; the body of Earth bears things. Thus, the body approaches the Dao.

The far south is intensely hot; the far north is intensely cold—thus the south melts while the north congeals, becoming the death-ground of the myriad things. In summer, the sun follows the Dipper northward; in winter, it follows the Dipper southward—thus Heaven and Earth unite, cold and heat harmonize, and things are born.

Heaven’s virtue is hardness, so the soft is not manifest; Earth’s body is softness, so the hard does not arise. Thus, *Zhen* (Thunder) is Heaven’s yin, while *Xun* (Wind) is Earth’s yang.

Earth is yin, yet within it yang responds to yin—thus the utmost yin is the *chen* (celestial stems), and the utmost yang is the sun, both belonging to Heaven, while Earth possesses only water and fire. Therefore, all things upon Earth have form and substance.

Yin subdues yang to give rise to form and substance; yang subdues yin to give rise to nature and disposition. Thus, yang generates yin, yin generates yang, yang overcomes yin, and yin overcomes yang. The yang that cannot be subdued does not appear on Earth; the yin that cannot be overcome does not appear in Heaven.

Where subdued yang is slight, the body must be soft—thus it fears yang and is employed by yang. Where subdued yang is abundant, the body must be hard—thus it resists yang and is employed by yin. Therefore, water and fire move and follow yang, while earth and stone rest and follow yin.

Yang generates yin, so water forms first; yin generates yang, so fire forms later. Yin and yang generate one another, and body and nature require each other. Thus, when yang departs, yin is exhausted; when yin is spent, yang perishes.

Metal and fire, when conjoined, flow; water and fire, when harmonized, ignite—each according to its kind. Water, when excessively cold, congeals; when it encounters fire, it is exhausted—each according to what it overcomes.

Yang obtains yin and becomes rain; yin obtains yang and becomes wind. The hard obtains the soft and becomes clouds; the soft obtains the hard and becomes thunder. Without yin, there can be no rain; without yang, there can be no thunder. Rain is soft and belongs to yin, yet yin cannot act alone—it awaits yang before arising. Thunder is hard and belongs to form, yet form cannot act by itself—it must await yang before erupting.

How profound! When King Wen composed the *Yi* (*Book of Changes*), did he not grasp the functioning of Heaven and Earth? Thus, *Qian* (Heaven) and *Kun* (Earth) unite to become *Tai* (Peace); *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) unite to become *Jiji* (Completion).

*Qian* arises at *zi* (midnight), *Kun* at *wu* (noon); *Kan* culminates at *yin* (tiger), *Li* at *shen* (monkey)—corresponding to Heaven’s seasons. Placing *Qian* in the northwest and *Kun* in the southwest, the eldest son takes office while the eldest daughter succeeds the mother; *Kan* and *Li* attain their positions, *Dui* (Lake) and *Zhen* (Thunder) form pairs—corresponding to Earth’s directions.

The laws of the king are fully embodied herein. *Qian* and *Kun* are the root of Heaven and Earth; *Li* and *Kan* are their functioning. Thus, the *Yi* begins with *Qian* and *Kun*, centers on *Li* and *Kan*, and concludes with *Weiji* (Incompletion). *Pi* (Stagnation) and *Tai* (Peace) stand at the center of the Upper Canon; *Xian* (Influence) and *Heng* (Duration) head the Lower Canon—all speaking of their functioning.

*Kun* governs the three daughters in the southwest; *Qian* governs the three sons in the northeast. The Upper Canon begins with three, the Lower Canon ends with four—both embodying the meaning of *Tai* (Peace through union). Thus, the *Yi* is about functioning: *Qian* employs nine, *Kun* employs six, the *Dayan* (Great Expansion) employs forty-nine, yet the "hidden dragon does not act."

How great is this functioning!

Herein I perceive the heart-mind of the sage. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite, they form *Tai* (Peace); when transformed, they become the miscellaneous hexagrams.

*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* serve as the functioning of the Upper Canon; *Dui*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, and *Xun* serve as the functioning of the Lower Canon. *Yi* (Nourishment), *Zhongfu* (Inner Truth), *Daguo* (Great Exceeding), and *Xiaoguo* (Small Exceeding) stand as the rectitude of both canons.

The *Yi* speaks of the alternation of one yin and one yang. *Zhen* and *Dui* mark the initial union, thus occupying the positions of dawn and dusk; *Li* and *Kan* represent the culmination of union, thus occupying the positions of midnight and noon. Though *Xun* and *Gen* do not unite, yin and yang remain intermixed, thus occupying the oblique positions of mid-function. *Qian* and *Kun* are pure yang and pure yin, thus occupying the positions of non-function.

*Qian* and *Kun* run vertically while the six children run horizontally—this is the root of the *Yi*. *Zhen* and *Dui* run horizontally while the six hexagrams run vertically—this is the functioning of the *Yi*.

Heaven’s yang lies in the south and its yin in the north; Earth’s yin lies in the south and its yang in the north. In humans, yang resides above and yin below; once united, yang descends and yin ascends.

The celestial number is twelve, where the sun and moon conjoin is called *chen* (celestial stem), the body of Heaven. The body of Heaven is the qi of the formless. Heaven’s yang is in the south, thus the sun dwells there; Earth’s firmness is in the north, thus mountains dwell there. Hence, the Earth is high in the northwest, and Heaven is high in the southeast.

Heaven’s spirit abides in the sun; the human spirit emanates from the eyes. The human spirit, when awake, rests in the heart; when asleep, it rests in the kidneys—thus mirroring Heaven, this is the Dao of day and night. Clouds move and rain descends, lightning flashes and thunder resounds—each follows its kind. Blowing, exhaling, sighing, and calling forth wind, rain, clouds, mist, and thunder—these utterances are of the same kind.

All things possess the sequence of *Taiji* (Supreme Polarity), *Liangyi* (Two Modes), *Sixiang* (Four Images), and *Bagua* (Eight Trigrams), as well as the images of antiquity and the present. Clouds differ as water, fire, earth, and stone—other kinds are likewise.

The degrees between the two solstices span one hundred eighty east-west and sixty south-north. The month of the winter solstice follows the path of the summer solstice’s sun; the month of the summer solstice follows the path of the winter solstice’s sun.

The four cardinal hexagrams are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. Observing their images, there is no reversal or inversion—hence they are called "cardinal." When yang is within yin, yang moves in reverse; when yin is within yang, yin moves in reverse. When yang is within yang or yin within yin, both move in accord. This is the principle of true ultimacy, visible upon consulting the diagrams.

The smallest grasses enter into *Kun*. The wood of the Five Phases is the kind of all things; the metal of the Five Phases emerges from stone. Thus, water, fire, earth, and stone do not encompass metal and wood—metal and wood arise between them.

That which receives Heaven’s qi moves; that which receives Earth’s qi is still. The kind of yang is round, yet when formed, it becomes square; the kind of yin is square, yet when formed, it becomes round. The branches and trunks of trees, the scattered formations of earth and stone—these do not change. Leaves and flowers are formed by water and fire, thus they transform and change.

East is red, south is white, west is yellow, north is black—these are the true colors. They may be verified in the times of dawn, noon, dusk, and night.

At the midnight of the winter solstice, yin reaches its extreme; at the dawn of the spring equinox, yang reaches its midpoint; at the noon of the summer solstice, yang reaches its extreme; at the dusk of the autumn equinox, yin reaches its midpoint. In all, there are three hundred sixty, halved to one hundred eighty—this is the number between the two solstices and two equinoxes.

Within yang there is yin; within yin there is yang—this is the Dao of Heaven. The yang within yang is the sun, the Dao of heat. The yin within yang is the moon, which, being of yang’s kind, can appear by day. The yang within yin is the stars, thus appearing by night. The yin within yin is *chen* (celestial stems), the body of Heaven and Earth.

*Chen* to Heaven is as the body of Heaven and Earth. Earth has the Five Phases; Heaven has the Five Wefts. Earth possesses only water and fire, yet Heaven also has the sun and moon—the moon is true water, the sun is true fire. The true essence of yin and yang generates the Five Phases, hence the numbers of Heaven and Earth are each five. The yang number alone exceeds seven; thus, beyond the five viscera, there are the pericardium and the Gate of Life, making seven. The true heart is *Li* fire; the Gate of Life is *Kan* water—from these, the five viscera are born. They are the masters of spirit and essence, the root of nature and life.

*Gan* (trunks) signifies the meaning of "stem," yang; *zhi* (branches) signifies the meaning of "branch," yin. There are ten trunks and twelve branches—thus, within the yang number there is yin, and within the yin number there is yang.

Fish are the kind of water; insects are the kind of wind. Eyes and mouth protrude, while ears and nostrils are hollow. Hollows receive sound and scent; things cannot close them. Protrusions see colors and distinguish flavors; things can close them. Though these four resemble one, each embodies its four aspects.

Water is the ground of fire; fire is the qi of wood. Black is the ground of white; cold is the ground of heat. Burrowing beasts resemble the stems of grass; forest-dwelling birds have feathers like the leaves of trees—kind makes them so.

The flowers of stone are like dissolved salt. The creatures of water differ not from those of land; each has the nature of cold and heat. In general, land is the yin within yang, while water is the yang within yin.

The sun, moon, and stars together form Heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone together form Earth. Ears, eyes, nose, and mouth together form the head; marrow, blood, bones, and flesh together form the body—this is the number five.

Fire is born from non-being; water is born from being. From *chen* to the sun is generation; from the sun to *chen* is functioning. Thus, accord is generation, and reversal is functioning.

The *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines—this is true astronomy. Eagles and roc-kind eat living prey, while chickens and ducks do not transmit living prey. Tigers and leopards eat living prey, while cats and dogs eat both living prey and grain.

By analogy, all can be known. Horses and oxen both belong to the yin kind; when finely distinguished, horses are yang while oxen are yin. Flying creatures delight in wind and excel in ascending flight, while walking creatures favor earth and thrive in descending movement—this is the work of yin and yang *qi*. The eggs of birds and insects are like fruits and grains. Grains produce many seeds, and insects do likewise. Silkworms, for instance: in one year, they become moths and lay eggs; in the next, the eggs become silkworms. Turnips and the like: in one year, they grow roots and shoots; in the next, the shoots bear seeds. All these are annual beings.

The *qi* of Heaven and Earth circulates: when it moves from north to south, there is order; when from south to north, there is chaos. After long chaos, it returns north to south. The Dao of Heaven and human affairs are alike—extending this to successive dynasties, one sees the principle of waxing and waning.

Creatures in water do not close their eyes; those in wind do. Walking creatures’ upper eyelids meet the lower; flying creatures’ lower eyelids meet the upper—kind determines this. Those in water with scales and fins belong to the flying kind; turtles and otters belong to the walking kind.

The Four Symbols, when interwoven in application: the sun and moon are Heaven’s yin and yang; water and fire are Earth’s yin and yang. The stars are Heaven’s firmness and softness; earth and stone are Earth’s firmness and softness. Flying and walking: chickens and ducks are of this kind. Walking and flying: dragons and horses are of this kind.

Yang governs expansion and growth; yin governs contraction and urgency. When the sun enters the expanding phase, yin follows yang; when it enters the contracting phase, yang follows yin.

The spirit is humanity’s master. As sleep approaches, it resides in the spleen; in deep sleep, in the kidneys; as waking nears, in the liver (or, some say, in the gallbladder); upon full waking, in the heart. Heaven and Earth’s great waking is in summer; the human spirit is stored in the heart.

Water-dwelling creatures are ruled by yin, with yang secondary; land-dwelling creatures are ruled by yang, with yin secondary. Thus, water creatures die when removed from water, and wind creatures die when submerged. Yet some cross between realms: turtles, crabs, geese, and ducks are of this kind.

Heaven and Earth intersect in three-tenths. Heavenly fire is formless fire; earthly fire is embodied fire. The formless takes form through things. The fire of metal and stone burns fiercer than that of plants and trees—this is due to the nature of the thing.

When *qi* and form flourish, the *hun* and *po* flourish; when *qi* and form decline, the *hun* and *po* decline with them. The *hun* transforms with *qi*; the *po* abides with form. Thus, while form exists, the *po* remains; when form dissolves, the *po* scatters.

Stars are the sun’s surplus; celestial stems are the moon’s surplus. The tiniest stars, like dust and sand, fall to become mounds and hills.

Storage is Heaven’s movement; the treasury is Earth’s movement. When Heaven and Earth move in parallel, they pair to form the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams interweave to form the sixty-four hexagrams.

The *Yi* takes root in *Qian* and *Kun* and arises from *Fu* and *Gou*. For *Fu*, the firm intermingles with the yielding; for *Gou*, the yielding intermingles with the firm—from this, endless transformation proceeds.

Dragons can grow large or small, yet they too have constraints. Subject to the *qi* of yin and yang, they transform when the time is right; if they transform repeatedly, they lose the power.

A year’s intercalary months consist of six yin and six yang. In three years, thirty-six days accumulate—hence one intercalary month every three years. In five years, sixty days accumulate—hence two intercalary months every five years.

The *Xiantian* diagram is the circle’s center. The moon’s body is inherently dark; it becomes bright by receiving the sun’s light.

In the human body, water becomes blood; earth becomes flesh. The gallbladder and kidneys share yin; the heart and spleen share yang. The heart governs the eyes; the spleen governs the nose.

Yang within yang is the sun; yang within yin is the moon; yin within yang is the stars; yin within yin is the celestial stems. Soft within soft is water; soft within firm is fire; firm within soft is earth; firm within firm is stone.

The nose’s breath is seen by the eyes; the mouth’s words are heard by the ears—this is resonance by kind.

The theory of the canopy’s support claims Kunlun slopes downward on four sides to form the sea. Reasoning reveals otherwise: Earth is square and still—how could it resemble the round, moving Heaven?

Animals grow from the head; plants grow from the root. For those growing from the head, life resides in the head; for those growing from the root, life resides in the root.

The ocean’s tides are Earth’s breath. Their correspondence with the moon arises from kindred nature.

*Zhen* is the dragon: one yang stirs beneath two yin—this is *Zhen*. In the depths of the abyss, are there not creatures that move? Are these not dragons?

Wind and water kinds are opposites in size. Heaven’s yang resides in the southeast, where the sun and moon dwell; Earth’s yin resides in the northwest, where fire and stone abide.

From *Zhen* to *Gen* is one section—this clarifies King Wen’s Eight Trigrams. “Heaven and Earth take their positions” clarifies Fuxi’s Eight Trigrams. The interweaving of the Eight Trigrams clarifies how they combine to form sixty-four.

“Counting what has passed” follows the sequence: moving with Heaven is leftward rotation—these are the already-generated hexagrams, hence “counting what has passed.” “Knowing what is to come” reverses the sequence: moving against Heaven is rightward rotation—these are the not-yet-generated hexagrams, hence “knowing what is to come.” The numbers of the *Yi* are thus formed by reversal.

This section directly explains the diagram’s meaning: reversal is like anticipating the four seasons.

The *Yaodian* states a full year is three hundred sixty-six days. The sun’s surplus is six days of excess; the moon’s surplus is six days of deficiency. If one removes the twelve surplus days of the sun and moon, three hundred fifty-four days remain—the number of days in a solar year. Dividing by twelve yields twenty-nine days.

The *Suwen* states: the lungs govern skin and hair; the heart, the vessels; the spleen, the flesh; the liver, the sinews; the kidneys, the bones—from above to below, from exterior to interior.

The heart governs blood and the kidneys govern bones—this is the method of exchange. Exchange is application. The statement “Qian represents Heaven” and the like refers to the fundamental image; “represents metal” and the like refers to the derived image. When Heaven and Earth operate in parallel, the viscera and bowels pair with the four [directions]: the viscera are Heaven, the four bowels are Earth.

Qian is odd, yang, and strong—thus nothing in the world is as strong as Heaven. Kun is even, yin, and compliant—thus nothing in the world is as compliant as Earth, for it complies with Heaven. Zhen is arousal—one yang arises. Arousal is movement, thus nothing in the world moves like thunder. Kan is sinking—one yang sinks into two yin. Sinking is descent, thus nothing in the world descends like water. Gen is cessation—one yang halts there, thus nothing in the world halts like mountains. Xun is entry—one yin enters beneath two yang, thus nothing in the world enters like wind. Li is adherence—one yin adheres to two yang, its hexagram forming a pattern of brilliant adornment, thus nothing in the world is as adorned as fire, or as clinging. Dui is joy—one yin emerges externally and delights in things, thus nothing in the world delights like marshland.

Fire is dark within and bright without, hence Li’s yang is external—fire’s application is external. Water is dark without and bright within, hence Kan’s yang is internal—water’s application is internal.

Why does man dwell in form among the walking kinds? The walking kinds are Earth’s eldest sons. From *Tai* to *Pi*, between them lies *Gu*; from *Pi* to *Tai*, between them lies *Sui*.

Heaven has five celestial bodies: the sun, moon, stars, and Heaven itself make five. Earth has five phases: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth make five. There are warm springs but no cold fire—yin can follow yang, but yang cannot follow yin. Where there is thunder, there is lightning; where there is lightning, there is wind. Rain arises from water, dew from earth, thunder from stone, lightning from fire. Lightning and wind are both yang at its extreme, thus where there is lightning, there must be wind. The hardness of wood cannot be shattered except by thunder; the softness of grass cannot be moistened except by dew.

Yang is noble and numinous: noble, thus it commands things; numinous, thus it conceals its application. Therefore the Dao gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things yet does not manifest itself. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things also take their model from the Dao.

Yang is the Dao’s application; yin is the Dao’s substance. Yang employs yin; yin employs yang. When yang is employed, yin is honored; when yin is employed, yang is honored. Yin approaches the Dao, thus it is likened to the Dao.

Six changes yield thirty-six; eight changes yield sixty-four; twelve changes yield three hundred eighty-four. Six sixes changing yield sixty-four changes, which become three hundred eighty-four. Eight eights changing yield forty-eight changes, which become three hundred eighty-four.

Before the Limitless, yin contains yang; after images appear, yang divides yin. Yin is yang’s mother; yang is yin’s father. Thus the mother gestates the eldest son to become *Fu*; the father begets the eldest daughter to become *Gou*. Therefore yang arises in *Fu* and yin arises in *Gou*.

Nature cannot be completed without substance; substance cannot arise without nature. Yang takes yin as its substance; yin takes yang as its substance. Movement is nature; stillness is substance. In Heaven, yang moves and yin is still; on Earth, yang is still and yin moves. Nature attains stillness through substance; substance follows nature in movement—thus yang unfolds slowly while yin moves swiftly.

Yang cannot stand alone—it must obtain yin before it can be established, thus yang takes yin as its foundation. Yin cannot manifest itself—it must await yang before it can be seen, thus yin takes yang as its initiator. Yang knows the beginning and enjoys the completion; yin emulates its pattern and exhausts its labor. Yang can know and can see; yin cannot know and cannot see. That which can know and see is being—thus yang’s nature is being, while yin’s nature is non-being. Yang is not partial in any way, while yin is partial in every way. Yang departs, while yin constantly abides. That which is not partial and constantly abides is full—thus yang’s substance is empty, while yin’s substance is full.

Does the root of Heaven and Earth arise from the center? Thus Qian and Kun repeatedly transform yet never depart from the center. Man dwells in the center of Heaven and Earth; the heart dwells in the center of man. At midday it is flourishing; at the full moon it is complete—thus the noble person values the center.

Originally there is one qi: when it arises, it is yang; when it wanes, it is yin—thus the two are one. The four are two; the six are three.

Eight is merely four. Thus one speaks of Heaven but not Earth, of ruler but not minister, of father but not son, of husband but not wife.

Yet Heaven attains Earth and the myriad things are born; the ruler attains the minister and the myriad transformations proceed; the father attains the son, the husband attains the wife, and the family Way is accomplished. Therefore, where there is one, there is two; where there is two, there is four; where there is three, there is six; where there is four, there is eight.

Where there is intention, there must be speech; where there is speech, there must be image; where there is image, there must be number. When number is established, image arises; when image arises, speech becomes manifest; when speech becomes manifest, intention is revealed.

Image and number are the trap and snare; speech and intention are the fish and hare. To obtain the fish and hare and forget the trap and snare—this is permissible. To abandon the trap and snare in pursuit of the fish and hare—this is not yet seen to succeed.

Heaven changes and man imitates it—thus *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* are the changes of the *Yi*. Man acts and Heaven responds—thus good fortune, misfortune, regret, and humiliation are the responses of the *Yi*.

If *yuan* and *heng* are taken as change, then *li* and *zhen* are the response. If good fortune and misfortune are taken as response, then regret and humiliation are the change.

*Yuan* is good fortune; good fortune is *li*. The response to *heng* is misfortune; misfortune is responded to with *zhen*. Regret leads to good fortune; humiliation leads to misfortune. Thus within change there is response, and within response there is change.

The response within change is the Dao of Heaven—thus if *yuan* is the change, *heng* responds to it; if *li* is the change, *zhen* responds to it. The change within response is the affair of man—thus change brings misfortune, response brings good fortune; change brings humiliation, response brings regret.

Regret is the precursor of good fortune; humiliation is the root of misfortune. Therefore, the noble person follows Heaven, not man.

*Yuan* is spring, it is benevolence. Spring is the beginning of the seasons; benevolence is the foremost of virtues. The season is not yet flourishing, yet virtue suffices to nurture others—thus one speaks of virtue, not the season.

*Heng* is summer, it is propriety. Summer is the flourishing of the seasons; propriety is the ornament of virtue. Flourishing must decline, and ornament cannot save it—thus one speaks of the season, not virtue. Hence it is said, “Great indeed is the *qian*’s *yuan*,” yet the ninth line holds regret.

*Li* is autumn, it is righteousness. Autumn is the fruition of the seasons; righteousness is the standard of virtue. The myriad things reach fruition and obtain benefit, yet righteousness is not connected to benefit—thus one speaks of the season, not virtue.

*Zhen* is winter, it is wisdom. Winter is the end of the seasons; wisdom is the decline of virtue. *Zhen* brings good fortune; the lack of *zhen* brings misfortune—thus one speaks of virtue, not the season. Hence it is said, “*Li* and *zhen* are the nature and the emotions.”

The Dao gives birth to Heaven; Heaven gives birth to Earth. When its work is accomplished, it retreats—thus the son succeeds the father in abdication, and *qian* retreats by one position.

Image arises from form; number arises from substance; name arises from speech; intention arises from function.

The numbers of the world emerge from principle; to violate principle is to enter into technique. The world’s people use numbers to enter into technique, thus losing principle.

All affairs under Heaven are achieved through the Dao, and then joy and sorrow cannot reach one.

Heaven can be exhausted by principle but not by form. Can the technique of the Hun Tian school exhaust Heaven by form?

To refine righteousness and enter the spirit is to achieve function. Without refining righteousness, one cannot enter the spirit, and thus cannot achieve function.

The Dao of governance must penetrate its changes; one cannot be like a lute peg fixed in place—just as the commands of winter cannot be enacted in spring.

That which is naturally so and cannot be altered are the inner image and inner number; all else are outer image and outer number.

The changes of Heaven’s Dao are the authority of the king’s Dao.

Each hexagram has its nature and its substance, yet all do not depart from the gate of *qian* and *kun*—just as the myriad things receive their nature from Heaven and each becomes its own nature.

In man, it is the nature of man; in birds and beasts, it is the nature of birds and beasts; in grasses and trees, it is the nature of grasses and trees.

Heaven takes qi as primary and form as secondary; Earth takes form as primary and qi as secondary. That which is in Heaven and on Earth is likewise.

Qi nourishes nature; nature encompasses qi. Thus when qi exists, nature exists; when nature moves, qi moves.

Heaven’s images and numbers can be deduced, but its spiritual function cannot be fathomed.

That which is naturally so is Heaven; only the sage can seek it out. Imitation is the work of man—yet if one acts or halts in accord with the seasons, even man is Heaven.

Birth is nature—Heaven. Completion is form—Earth. The sun entering the Earth is the image of conjoined essence.

The body is four, the changes are six—encompassing spirit and qi. Qi’s changes must be six, hence three hundred and sixty.

In all affairs, when seven-tenths of the utmost is reached, one may stop. For the sun at the summer solstice halts at sixty degrees, and when combined with dawn and dusk, the division of light and color can be discerned—this is approximately seven-tenths.

Though the diagram has no text, my words throughout the day never depart from it, for the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all contained within it.

Qi is merely one—*qian* presides over it. Spirit is also merely one—riding qi and transforming, entering and exiting between being and non-being, without direction yet unfathomable.

Without knowing *qian*, one cannot know the principles of nature and destiny.

Speak only when the time is right, responding to change with words—words do not originate from oneself.

Benevolence matches Heaven and Earth—this is called man. Only the benevolent can truly be called man.

Birth and completion, completion and birth—this is the Dao of the *Yi*.

Qi is the dwelling of spirit; form is the dwelling of qi.

Heaven is six, Earth is four. Heaven takes qi as its substance and spirit as its spirit; Earth takes form as its substance and qi as its spirit. Only man encompasses the myriad things and becomes their spirit.

Like the sounds of birds and beasts, each can perform one according to its kind—only man can do all. Extending this to other affairs, none are otherwise.

Only man attains the interwoven function of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon—other kinds cannot. Man’s birth may truly be called noble. If Heaven and Earth bestow nobility yet man does not honor it himself, this violates the principle of Heaven and Earth, and no misfortune could be greater.

The bright and dim states of a lamp are the image of the sun and moon. The moon is the shadow of the sun; emotion is the shadow of nature. The heart is nature, the gall is emotion; nature is spirit, emotion is ghost.

The heart is the Supreme Ultimate—it is also said that the Dao is the Supreme Ultimate. Form may be divided, but spirit cannot. Yin affairs occupy the greater part, for yang is one while yin is two.

After the winter solstice comes exhalation; after the summer solstice comes inhalation—this is the yearly breath of Heaven and Earth. To rejoice with things in their joy, to grieve with things in their sorrow—this is to express with proper measure. If I do not objectify things, then I can master things.

To follow the self is emotion; emotion leads to obscuration, obscuration to confusion. To follow things is nature; nature leads to spirit, spirit to clarity. Concealed in Heaven, concealed in Earth, arriving without movement, not seized by yin and yang—this is spirit.

Of Heaven’s calamities, one in ten may still be averted; of man’s calamities, nine in ten cannot be escaped. The learning of the prior Heaven is of the heart; the learning of the posterior Heaven is of traces.

That which enters and exits, has and has not, dies and lives—this is the Dao. Spirit is nowhere yet nowhere absent. The perfected person communicates with other minds because they share the same root.

The Dao and the One are strong names for spirit. To take spirit as spirit—this is the ultimate word. The body is Earth, rooted in stillness; what enables it to move is the agency of blood and qi.

Generation after generation, Heaven and Earth accomplish their work; differentiation and classification, the sage accomplishes his ability. To observe things through things is nature; to observe things through the self is emotion. Nature is impartial and luminous; emotion is biased and obscure.

Yang governs opening and issuing forth; yin governs closing and drawing in. When the sun is at *zi* in Water, life arises; when it departs, death follows—this is the meaning of union and non-union. Yin opposes yang as two, yet when yang comes, life arises; when yang departs, death follows. The life and death of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are governed by yang, thus all return to the One.

Spirit has no direction, but nature has substance. Issuing from nature, it appears in emotion; issuing from emotion, it appears in countenance—responding according to kind. If Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things, then the myriad things are the myriad things; if the Dao generates Heaven and Earth, then Heaven and Earth are also the myriad things.

Man’s nobility encompasses the myriad things. By valuing himself, he attains his nobility, and thus can employ all kinds. Generally, man’s good and evil take shape in speech and manifest in action, at which point others come to know them. Yet when they first sprout in the heart and arise in thought, ghosts and spirits already know them—this is why the noble person is cautious in solitude.

Qi transforms and form changes. Among the kinds of man, all the natures of the myriad things are complete. Man’s spirit is the spirit of Heaven and Earth; man’s self-deception is how he deceives Heaven and Earth—how can he not be vigilant?

Man’s fear of ghosts is like ghosts’ fear of man. When man accumulates goodness and yang increases, even ghosts fear him; when he accumulates evil and yin increases, ghosts do not fear him. The great person aligns his fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits—what fear could he have?

The learning of the utmost principle does not reach completion without utmost sincerity. The learning of the principles of things may have points that do not connect, but they cannot be forcibly connected. Forced connection implies a self, and a self loses principle and enters into technique.

When the heart is unified and undivided, it can respond to the myriad things—this is why the noble person empties his heart and does not move. The sage benefits things without a self. In brightness there are sun and moon; in darkness there are ghosts and spirits.

The sage’s Six Classics are utterly without trace, like the Way of Heaven. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records actual events, and good and evil take shape within them. The method of the *Doctrine of the Mean* is that what comes from within is Heaven, what comes from without is man.

In the method of tones, opening and closing pertain to the pitch-pipes of Heaven; purity and turbidity pertain to the pitch-pipes of Earth. What first closes then opens is spring; what purely opens is summer; what first opens then closes is autumn; winter closes and has no sound. The east is the sound of spring, yang is the sound of summer—this shows that those who create tones also have their attainments. The *xian* tone is the sound of winter.

Still and unmoving, returning to the root and recovering stillness—this is the time of *kun*. Moved and thus penetrating the causes of all under Heaven, yang moves within, with not even a hair’s breadth between—this is the meaning of *fu*. To move without seeing movement is delusion—this is movement in the time of *pi*. To move upon seeing movement is *wu-wang*. Yet the reason there is disaster is that yang is weak and has no response. If there is a response and then movement, this is *yi*.

“Essential qi becomes things”—this is form; “the wandering soul becomes change”—this is spirit. It is also said, “Essential qi becomes things”—this is substance; “the wandering soul becomes change”—this is function.

The learning of the noble person takes moistening the self as its foundation. Governing others and responding to things are all secondary matters. Cutting and dividing are matters of talent and strength; discerning and distinguishing are matters of knowledge and understanding; magnanimity and tolerance are matters of virtue and capacity. These three cannot be lacking.

Those without virtue blame others, resent others, and are easily filled—once filled, they stop. Those who can move according to the principle of Heaven have the workings of creation within themselves. Learning that does not connect Heaven and man cannot be called learning. To inquire into the highest under Heaven is as if nothing exists.

Those who attain the principle of Heaven not only moisten the self but also moisten the heart. Not only do they moisten the heart, but they also moisten their nature and life. Calendars cannot be without error. Those who study calendars today know only calendar methods, not calendar principles. Those who can arrange calculations are like Luo Xiahong; those who can predict movements are like Gan and Shi. Luo Xiahong knew only calendar methods, while Yang Xiong knew both calendar methods and calendar principles.

Yanzi did not transfer his anger nor repeat his mistakes. Transferring anger and repeating mistakes are both matters of emotion, not of nature. Without reaching the level of nature and life, one cannot be called a true lover of learning. Yang Xiong’s *Canon of the Mysterious* may be said to have perceived the heart of Heaven and Earth.

The *Book of Changes* has no fixed form. If it is said to have established norms, then it has a form. Yet one fears that it might be taken as having a fixed form, and so it is said: “It cannot be reduced to a fixed standard.” Where there are established norms, there is constancy; where it cannot be reduced to a fixed standard, there is change.

Zhuang Zhou’s eloquence stands alone for thousands of years. For instance, when the Cook Ding dissects an ox, he speaks of “hesitating” and “looking around in all directions,” and when Confucius observes the waters of Lüliang, he says the way of treading water admits no partiality—these are all words of the highest principle.

The *Book of Changes* is the instrument by which the sage nurtures the noble person and diminishes the petty person. In nurturing, it opens the way before it comes to pass; in diminishing, it closes the way before it comes to pass. Now diminishing, now nurturing; now opening, now closing—all is so utterly seamless that no trace remains. Who but the most spiritually attuned under Heaven could attain this?

In *Great Exceeding*, the root and the branch are weak. Only one with great virtue and great position can remedy this. Ordinary circumstances may allow for remedy, but those with great virtue and great position may exceed—Yin and Zhou were such men, and they were not to be feared. Those with great virtue but no great position cannot exceed—Confucius and Mencius were such men, and they were not to be overstepped.

Does their position not match their virtue? How great is position! It is the dwelling-place for awaiting the proper time to act.

Next, *Return* follows *Splitting*—does order arise from chaos? *Coupling* follows *Parting*—does chaos arise from order? The times! The times!

There has never been *Splitting* without *Return*, never *Coupling* without *Parting*. Guard against what must be guarded, and the state and household will endure, descendants will flourish. Thus the sage values prevention before things arise—this is called the great guiding principle of the *Yi*.

The study of the precelestial is the method of the heart, so all diagrams begin from the center—all transformations and affairs arise from the heart. The path one walks must not be narrow; if wide, there are few obstructions.

Those who know the *Yi* need not cite or explain it to be considered knowledgeable. Mencius never spoke of the *Yi*, yet the Dao of the *Yi* resides within it—only few perceive it. To use the *Yi* is to know the *Yi*; Mencius may be called one who skillfully employed the *Yi*.

What is called "emperor, king, hegemon" is not limited to the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons. Employ non-action, and one is sovereign; employ kindness and trust, and one is emperor; employ impartiality, and one is king; employ cunning and force, and one is hegemon.

Spirits and gods are formless yet functional—their nature and appearance can be known, for their effects are visible. The ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet of humans; the branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and colors of plants—all are the work of spirits and gods.

Who governs the blessing of the good and the calamity of the licentious? Who possesses keen perception and uprightness? Swift without haste, arriving without movement—who entrusts these? All are the nature and appearance of spirits and gods.

The *Yi* has intent and images; all intentions are established to clarify images. It encompasses three types below: verbal images, which do not imitate things but speak directly to clarify matters; analogical images, which imitate a single thing to clarify intent; and numerical images, such as seven days, eight months, three years, or ten years.

The numbers of the *Yi* exhaust the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth. Some ask: Do Heaven and Earth also have a beginning and end? Since there is waxing and waning, how could there be no end and beginning? Though vast, Heaven and Earth are also forms and vessels—merely two things.

The *Yi* has inner images, which are its principles and subtleties; and outer images, which designate a single unchanging thing. In humans, the Dao of Qian becomes male, the Dao of Kun becomes female; in things, the Dao of Qian becomes yang, and the Dao of Kun becomes yin.

"Spirits have no direction, and the *Yi* has no form"—to be fixed in one direction is to be incapable of transformation, which is not spirit. To have a fixed form is to be incapable of adaptability, which is not the *Yi*. Though the *Yi* has form, its form is image—it borrows images to reveal form, yet fundamentally has no form.

In matters great or small, the Dao resides within. To be content with one’s lot is called the Dao; to be discontent is called contrary to the Dao.

The tuning of pitch and numbers proceeds to seven and stops, for at the summer solstice, the sun rises in *yin* and sets in *xu*. During the three periods of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*, the sun enters the earth, and the eye sees nothing—these three numbers are inactive, corresponding to the three periods. Thus the numbers of living things are the same: it is not that the numbers are inactive, but that they exist unseen.

The six voids are the six positions, empty to await the affairs of change and movement. Where there is form, there is substance; where there is nature, there is emotion. Heaven governs function, Earth governs substance. The sage governs function, the common people govern substance—thus they "use it daily yet do not know it."

The law began with Fuxi, was completed under Yao, reformed by the Three Kings, reached its peak with the Five Hegemons, and was severed by Qin. The traces of order and chaos through the ages cannot escape this.

Spirit is the master of the *Yi*, hence it has no direction. The *Yi* is the function of spirit, hence it has no form. Following principle is the norm; beyond principle lies the extraordinary.

Fire is governed by nature, with form secondary; water is governed by form, with nature secondary. Yang is nature, yin is emotion; nature is spirit, emotion is ghost.

The *Yi* begins with Qian and Kun, centers on Kan and Li, and concludes with the union and non-union of water and fire—all are supreme principles.

The Supreme Ultimate is one and unmoving. When it generates two, the two are spirit. Spirit generates numbers, numbers generate images, images generate vessels.

The Supreme Ultimate is unmoving—this is nature. When activated, it becomes spirit; spirit becomes numbers, numbers become images, images become vessels. The transformations of vessels return to spirit.

All hexagrams not directly derived from Qian and Kun arise from *Peace* and *Stagnation*. *Stagnation* and *Peace* are the union of Qian and Kun. Qian and Kun arise from the odd and even; the odd and even emerge from the Supreme Ultimate.

Heaven causes me to possess—this is called fate. Fate within me is called nature; nature within things is called principle.

In the lunar cycle, yang qi arises from the north and is exhausted in the north—this is called the cyclic transformation of change. When spring yang gains power, there is often drought; when autumn yin gains power, there is often rain.

The primordial One, the second One—these generate the beginning of Heaven and Earth, which is the Supreme Ultimate. Within the myriad things, each has its own beginning—this is the root of generation.

The heart of Heaven and Earth is the root of the generation of the myriad things. The emotions of Heaven and Earth are their appearances, shared with the appearances of spirits and gods.

Zhuangzi and Huizi strolled above the Hao Bridge. Zhuangzi said: "The minnows swim leisurely—this is their joy." This is exhausting one’s own nature to exhaust the nature of things. Not only fish are so—all things under Heaven are so. One like Zhuangzi may be called adept at understanding things.

Laozi knew the substance of the *Yi*. "Without thought, without action" is the realm of spirit’s wondrous unity. The sage uses this to purify the heart and retreat into secrecy.

The Supreme Ultimate is the ultimate of the Dao; the Supreme Mystery is the origin of the Dao; the Supreme Simplicity is the root of color.

The Great Unity is the beginning of numbers; the Great Beginning is the inception of affairs. Yet their success is one and the same. If the grand broth can be harmonized and the dark wine can be diluted, then Creation itself may be harmonized or diluted. Exchange places, and there is no self. Sincerity is the instrument of inherent nature, boundless and without direction. How profound!

Lord Liu was adept at concealing his utility. Works such as the *Plain Questions* and *Secret Teachings* may be called the ultimate in the principles of arts. When Gusou killed a man, Shun regarded abandoning the world as discarding a worn-out sandal. Secretly carrying his father on his back, he fled and dwelt by the seashore for the rest of his life, joyful and forgetting the world. Though the sage is vast as all under Heaven, he cannot alter the love of Heaven-endowed nature.

Someone asked about "manifesting it in benevolence, concealing it in utility." It is like the illumination of the sun and moon, the completion of the year by the four seasons—this is manifesting benevolence. That its measures and calculations are so, yet one does not know why they are so, is concealing utility.

The noble person, in studying the *Yi*, delights in images, delights in numbers, delights in words, delights in meaning. *Dui* means joy. All else entails harm, but only in the fellowship of friends discussing and learning is there no joy in this—hence it speaks of its utmost.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* does not descend from Heaven or emerge from Earth; it measures the principles of things and gauges the feelings of people, acting where it finds peace—this is to attain it. The virtues of *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* each encompass matters of good and ill fortune, regret and remorse. Though one may act in virtue, if it contravenes the times, there may still be misfortune.

When Tang exiled Jie and King Wu punished Zhou, they were not deemed regicides. As Mencius said: "A man and woman not passing objects directly is ritual, but if a sister-in-law is drowning, one grasps her hand—this is expediency." Thus, Confucius both honored Boyi and Yi and also sided with Tang and Wu. Boyi and Yi were benevolent; Tang and Wu were righteous. Yet only Tang and Wu were permissible—any others would be usurpation.

Yin is the shadow of yang; ghosts are the shadow of humans. Duke Mu of Qin rendered service to Zhou, was able to reform his faults and change his errors, and was the foremost of the hegemons. Marquis Wen of Jin diligently served the king for generations and moved King Ping to Luoyang—he was next. Duke Huan of Qi convened the feudal lords nine times without chariots of war—he was next. King Zhuang of Chu was mighty—he was next. Though Duke Xiang of Song was a hegemon, his power was weak; he assembled the feudal lords but was seized by Chu and is not worth discussing.

Those who study the *Spring and Autumn Annals* must first determine the merits and faults of the Four States—without this, affairs lack coherence and fail to grasp the heart of the sage. During the Spring and Autumn period, none surpassed the Four States in merit, nor were any greater in fault. Thus, these four are the foremost in merit and the chief in guilt.

Some say the *Spring and Autumn Annals* is not a book on nature and destiny—this is wrong. When it records that the mouth of the sacrificial ox was injured, the divination was changed, and when the ox died, the suburban sacrifice was not performed, yet the Three Observances remained—this was to censure Lu’s affairs. How could the sage harbor intent? It is because of the absence of self—does this not arise from nature and destiny?

It is also said that the *Spring and Autumn Annals* teaches praise and blame through events—how could it allow one to establish private intentions? Further, it is said that the *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the sage’s editing, the utmost impartiality under Heaven. Not knowing why the sage was impartial—such as when the ox was injured, he knew Lu had usurped the suburban sacrifice; when six rows of dancers were first offered, he knew the former usurpation of eight rows; when the Pheasant Gate was newly built, he knew there had been no Pheasant Gate before—none of this was the sage’s intentional intervention. Thus, it is said the *Spring and Autumn Annals* is a book that exhausts nature.

The *Yi* as a book is meant to follow the principles of nature and destiny, conforming to the natural. Confucius cut off four things and unified them with one—he was one who attained destiny. Yanzi aligned his heart and treaded emptiness—he was a lover of learning. Zigong accumulated much in his learning, conjectured to seek the Dao, but could not hollow his heart and extinguish his views, entrusting himself to principle—he was one who did not accept destiny. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* follows the principles of the natural and does not establish private intentions—thus it is a book that exhausts nature.

The first and the top are the same, yet the top is excessive and does not match the first’s progress. The second and the fifth are the same, yet the second’s central yin does not match the fifth’s central yang. The third and the fourth are the same, yet the third, at the top of the lower trigram, does not compare to the fourth’s proximity to the ruler.

Humans are noble above all things, valuing themselves to attain their nobility—this is how they can employ all things. The *Plain Questions* and *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman* are books from the Warring States period.

"Manifesting it in benevolence, concealing it in utility"—was Confucius not adept at concealing his utility? Zhuangzi and Xunzi’s followers lost themselves in disputation. Boyi deemed it righteous not to eat Zhou grain, yet starved to death—he only attained benevolence. "When three walk together, there must be a teacher among them." To befriend the worthy of one’s village, then the worthy of the world, and still find the world insufficient, to esteem and discuss the ancients—none surpass this.

When righteousness is weighty, one’s inner self is weighty; when profit is weighty, one’s outer self is weighty. One who can heal what others can heal is not called a good physician. One who can heal what others cannot heal is the world’s good physician. One who can handle affairs others cannot handle can do what others cannot do.

People’s trouble lies in self-satisfaction; when full, they stop—thus Yu did not become self-satisfied. Borrowing to appear worthy, though one studies, one should always seem insufficient and not regard deep waters as lofty. If one applies the heart, there must be some attainment—only the difference lies in quantity and the depth or shallowness of wisdom and knowledge.

When principles are exhausted, one knows nature; when nature is exhausted, one knows destiny; when destiny is known, one knows the ultimate. Generally, when one’s position is lost before attainment, even attainment brings no joy.

If one’s attainment precedes loss, then loss becomes difficult to bear, and one must inevitably fall into ruin. A person must value the inner; when the inner is weighty, the outer becomes light. If the inner is light, the outer must become weighty, and the pursuit of profit and fame knows no bounds.

Those who speak of reading books are many, but those who truly read are few. If one attains the true joy of Heavenly principle, what book cannot be read? What obstacle cannot be broken? What principle cannot be mastered? The three—celestial timing, earthly patterns, and human affairs—are not easily understood.

Natural endowment comes from Heaven; learning and inquiry come from others. Natural endowment emerges from within; learning and inquiry enter from without. From sincerity comes enlightenment—this is nature. From enlightenment comes sincerity—this is learning.

Boyi and Liuxia Hui each grasped one aspect of the sage. Boyi attained the sage’s purity; Liuxia Hui attained the sage’s harmony. Confucius was at times pure, at times harmonious, at times active, at times still—thus he mastered the sage’s timing.

In the *Tai Xuan*, nine days correspond to two hexagrams, while the remaining hexagram corresponds to four and a half days. The Way of warfare requires that the people be prosperous, granaries full, treasuries replete, the army strong, and its cause just—only when celestial timing is favorable, earthly advantages secured, and all conditions met can one act.

The *Laozi*’s five thousand words largely elucidate the principles of things. Now, if one ascends two platforms of equal height, one cannot perceive their loftiness; only when one platform is higher does one recognize the lowness of the other. The same applies to a state, a family, or an individual: one who can govern the self can govern a family; one who can govern a family can govern a state; one who can govern a state can govern the world.

The heart is the root of the body; the family is the root of the state; the state is the root of the world. The heart moves the body—if the heart does not desire something, can the body act upon it?

A person’s spirit is precious when concealed and employed; if flaunted externally, few do not fail. Like a sharp blade, when an object comes, it cuts through—but if one relies on the blade’s sharpness to seek out what to sever, both blade and object will be damaged.

Words spoken from true sincerity require no labor of the heart and bring ease; over time, others will trust them. Deception and cunning may deceive for a moment, but in the long run, they must fail.

A person’s worth lies in virtue. Petty men may possess talent, but talent cannot be relied upon—virtue cannot be lacking. Heaven and Earth, sun and moon endure simply by their constancy; thus, one should aspire to the far-reaching and not be content with the near.

The noble person, whether in the fields or the court, acts according to the affairs of the fields or the court—thus, there is no situation in which one does not find contentment. Clever schemes may be applied for a time, but they are bound to reach their limit. Only perfect sincerity endures as long as Heaven and Earth.

If Heaven and Earth did not exist, perfect sincerity could cease—but since Heaven and Earth cannot cease, neither can perfect sincerity.

Building a carriage indoors, it can travel the world, for its wheels align with the ruts. If one follows principle and accords with human sentiment, wherever the sun and moon shine, one’s path can be followed.

Gathering the world’s goodness makes one vast; relying solely on oneself makes one small. The Han Confucians took "reversing the norm to accord with the Dao" as *quan* (expediency)—they grasped but one aspect. *Quan* serves to balance the light and heavy; the sage exercises *quan* by weighing what is light and heavy and acting accordingly, merely seeking what is fitting. Thus, holding to the center without *quan* is still one-sided.

Wang Tong said that the *Spring and Autumn Annals* embodies the *quan* of the kingly Way—none but Wang Tong could reach this understanding. *Quan* resides in the individual, then in the village, extending to the world—each has its own *quan*. Though their applications differ, the essence of *quan* is one.

A bow may be strong or weak, yet when two people draw the same bow, the strong find it weak, while the weak find it strong. The strong do not consider their strength excessive but deem the bow weak; the weak do not acknowledge their lack of strength but deem the bow strong. Why do they not reflect more deeply? The bow itself is neither strong nor weak—it is the difference in the two people’s strength.

Now, if a cup of food is placed before two starving men, if they yield to each other, both may eat; if they fight, not only will they contend, but one may not get any food at all. Both are human sentiments—few understand this, yet once grasped, all things under Heaven are like this.

The learning of what precedes Heaven centers on sincerity. Perfect sincerity can communicate with the divine; without sincerity, one cannot attain the Dao. Good medicine should never leave one’s hand; good words should never leave one’s mouth.

Affairs must be measured against one’s strength—only by measuring strength can one endure. Learning takes human affairs as its greatest concern; today’s classics are the human affairs of the ancients. Beyond the three commentaries on the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Lu Chun and Dan Zhu can be studied together.

Jizha’s talent approached Boyi’s; Shu Xiang, Zichan, and Yanzi were of equal standing; Guan Zhong employed clever schemes but later understood the principles of things—his talent and strength surpassed others. The Five Hegemons were the foremost in merit and the greatest in blame.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is Confucius’ penal code. Merit and fault do not conceal each other; the sage first praises merit, then censures fault—thus, even a guilty person’s merit must be recorded, and one cannot be without forgiveness.

The construction of two new observatories was a censure, for they replaced what had not existed before. The initial offering of six rows of dancers was a praise, for it corrected the former usurpation of eight rows.

A certain person received the *Spring and Autumn Annals* from Yin Shiru, who received it from Mu Bochang. Later, this person attacked Bochang, saying: "The *Spring and Autumn Annals* contains no praise—it is all censure." Tian Shugu said: "Sun Fu also claimed the *Spring and Autumn Annals* has censure but no praise."

He replied: "When ritual and law decay and ruler and minister are in chaos, if there are those who can perform even minor good deeds, how can one not promote them?"

Moreover, the Five Hegemons truly rendered service to the All-Under-Heaven. Though the Five Hegemons fell short of true kingship, were they not still superior to those who usurped and seized power? How could one not acknowledge them?

Those who study the *Spring and Autumn Annals* yet fail to distinguish between name and reality, or to determine the merits and faults of the Five Hegemons, cannot be said to have truly mastered the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Only by first establishing the merits and faults of the Five Hegemons can one grasp its overarching intent. To seek it in every single matter would lead to no coherent thread.

In all learning, the fault lies in excessive self-assertion. King Ping in name was a king, yet in reality he did not match even a single state’s lord. Qi and Jin, though merely marquises, in reality usurped the authority of kings. These are instances of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ distinction between name and reality.

Zigong wished to abolish the sacrificial lamb for the *gaoshuo* ceremony. The lamb was the name; the ritual, the reality. Though the reality had perished while the name remained, this was still preferable to the loss of both name and reality. If the name were preserved, how could one know that a true king might not arise in later generations? Thus, it was a matter of awaiting such a time.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* was composed because the ruler was weak and ministers strong; hence, it is called the Book of Names and Distinctions. The difficulty for the sage lies in accomplishing great deeds without losing benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust—how can this be achieved? It lies in cutting off the Four [Beginnings].

One who owns a horse lends it to another to ride, setting aside the self to follow others.

Someone asked: What is meant by "the difficulty of talent"?

He replied: It is only in facing great matters that the difficulty of talent becomes apparent.

The questioner asked: Why speak only of talent?

He replied: Talent is the fine natural endowment of Heaven; learning is how the scholar perfects that talent.

The questioner asked: Were there not ancient men who accomplished great deeds without learning? Why insist on learning?

He replied: Zhou Bo and Huo Guang were able to accomplish great deeds, yet precisely because they lacked learning, they did not attain perfection. A person without learning cannot illuminate principle; one who cannot illuminate principle is stubborn and unyielding.

One with outstanding talent must possess firmness. Firmness in due measure suffices to establish great deeds and endure hardship. If misapplied, it leads to wickedness. Thus, Confucius said of Shen Cheng, "How could he attain firmness?" One with evil intentions must lack firmness.

The noble person is enlightened by righteousness—this is the mark of the worthy. The petty person is enlightened by profit alone. Only the sage can forget both righteousness and profit.

The noble person fears righteousness and thus refrains from certain actions; the petty person simply has no fear. The sage, however, moves without transgressing the norm—what righteousness is there to fear?

Yan Hui did not repeat his errors. Confucius said of him: "If he had any fault, he never failed to recognize it." Recognizing it, he never repeated it—this is singularity without repetition.

Han Yu believed that one should eradicate faults from the heart and thereby prevent their recurrence, but this is to surpass even Yan Hui. To pass over faults or to approve of goodness are both private inclinations. How can one thereby attain the Dao?

Someone asked: Is not approving of goodness still better than approving of evil?

He replied: The sage does not act thus. Private inclinations, whether toward faults or goodness, are the same.

In learning and cultivating the mind, the danger lies in not following the straight path. Abandoning profit and desire, following the straight path, and acting with utmost sincerity—then there is nothing that cannot be penetrated.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth is simply straightness; one should seek it through straightness. To employ cunning and shortcuts in pursuit of it is to bend Heaven and Earth to human desire—is this not difficult?

In all matters, great or small, there is the principle of Heaven and humanity. Cultivating the self is the work of humanity; encountering or not encountering success is the work of Heaven. Remaining unmoved by gain or loss is how one accords with Heaven. Seeking success through perilous means and luck is to go against Heaven. In seeking, one acts as a human; in obtaining or not obtaining, one follows Heaven. Remaining unmoved by gain or loss is how one accords with Heaven. To forcibly seize what one desires is to go against the principle of Heaven. Those who go against the principle of Heaven will inevitably bring misfortune upon themselves.

The two observatories of Lu and the great suburban sacrifices were not in accordance with ritual. If the feudal lords had the four seasonal sacrifices as their regular offerings, it would be acceptable, but the great quinquennial sacrifice was not permissible.

Ran Yong could be made to face south [as a ruler] and could be entrusted with governance.

Who can exit without using the door? The door is the Way; there has never been one who could succeed without following the Way. Those who do not use the door are like those who sneak through cracks and crevices.

To hear much, choose what is good and follow it—though one hears much, one must choose the good and follow it. To see much and remember it—*shi* means to distinguish. Though one sees much, one must have a way to distinguish it.

Luo Xiahong revised Zhuanxu’s calendar into the *Taichu* calendar. Yang Xiong, taking the *Taichu* as his standard, composed the *Tai Xuan*, which consists of eighty-one hexagrams. Nine parts form two hexagrams, and every fifteen is separated by fourteen. In finer division, four and a half parts correspond to one hexagram. The qi arises from the center, hence the first hexagram is the central one.

"Origination, flourishing, advantage, and perseverance"—their changes are not constant; these are the transformations of the Dao of Heaven. "Good fortune, misfortune, regret, and remorse"—their changes are not fixed; these are the responses of the human Dao.

"'The alternation of one yin and one yang is called the Dao'—the Dao is without sound or form, invisible and intangible. Thus, it borrows the term 'Dao' from the path one travels." Human conduct must follow the Way. The alternation of one yin and one yang is the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Things arise and are completed through it.

"Manifest in benevolence"—the work of Heaven and Earth in generating the myriad things can be seen by humanity. The means by which they create the myriad things cannot be seen—this is "concealed in their function."

The ten heavenly stems belong to Heaven; the twelve earthly branches belong to Earth. The stems and branches combine the functions of Heaven and Earth.

The *Book of Changes* began with the Three Sovereigns; the *Book of Documents* began with the Two Emperors; the *Book of Songs* began with the Three Kings; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* began with the Five Hegemons.

From *Qian* and *Kun* to *Kan* and *Li* concerns the Dao of Heaven; from *Xian* and *Heng* to *Jiji* and *Weiji* concerns human affairs.

Human planning is the work of humanity; ghostly planning is the work of Heaven. When Heaven and humanity plan together and both are fitting, affairs succeed and are auspicious.

To adapt to the times and thereby manage the world’s affairs without transgressing the great norm of ritual; to adapt to the times and thereby follow the world’s principles without losing the great authority of righteousness—this is the Way of the noble person.

The theory of the five planets began with Gan De and Shi Shen.

When human intelligence is strong, the intelligence of things weakens.

Zhuangzi composed the "Robber Zhi" chapter to illustrate the utmost evil, which even the utmost sage cannot transform. This is because the supremely wise and the basest cannot be altered when they meet.

The one Confucian of the state of Lu refers to Confucius.

The world’s affairs begin with excess weight yet end in lightness; begin with excess thickness yet end in thinness. How much more so for those that begin with lightness or thinness?

Thus, few err through excess weight, but many err through excess lightness; few err through excess thickness, but many err through excess thinness. Therefore, the noble person does not fear erring through excess weight but constantly fears erring through excess lightness; does not fear erring through excess thickness but constantly fears erring through excess thinness.

In Zhuangzi’s "Equalizing Things," there is still the matter of comparison. Comparison leads to contention, contention to imbalance, and imbalance to disharmony.

"Without thought, without action" is the realm of spirit and wonder, the state of unity. This is what is meant by "unifying it with the One."

The sage uses this to purify the mind and withdraw, concealing it in secrecy.

"Not yielding to one’s teacher when it comes to benevolence" is the Way of advancing benevolence.

Duke Mu of Qin attacked Zheng and later regretted his mistake, swearing an oath—this was not merely a matter of hegemony. Had he been near the kingly Way and able to repent, he would have suffered no loss. This is why the sage recorded it at the end of the book.

Liu Xuan asked about non-action. The reply was: "Speak only when the time is right, and people will not tire of your words; laugh only when joyful, and people will not tire of your laughter; take only when it is righteous, and people will not tire of your taking. This is what is called non-action."

Master Wen Zhong said: "Those who delight in ease will surely know much sorrow; those who give lightly will surely love to seize."

Someone asked: "If the world all contends for profit and abandons righteousness, what can I alone do?"

The Master said: "Abandon what they contend for and take what they abandon—is this not the way of the noble person?"

Such are the words of principle and righteousness.

The division between heart and conduct has long existed. Such are the words of creation and transformation.

Zhuangzi’s qi was bold, as in the matter of Lü Liang—his words reached the utmost.

Robber Zhi spoke of affairs that were beyond remedy, which even the sage could do nothing about. The Fisherman spoke of affairs that could not be forced, which even the sage could not force. These words concern the principle of action and non-action: following principle is non-action, forcing is action.

Gold must be smelted a hundred times before it becomes refined; so too must people.

Does the Buddhist teaching, which abandons the Way of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, accord with the principles of nature?

For those who are devoted to the Dao, in general terms: "devotion" means to focus the mind in concealment; "virtue" is what one attains for oneself, having form and thus a basis. Virtue is rooted in benevolence, hence it is said to "depend."

Zhuangzi said: "Though the cook does not prepare the food, the invocator does not leap over the wine vessel and altar to take his place." This expresses the noble person’s thought not exceeding its proper place, acting according to one’s fundamental position.

When Hu Shegu of Jin killed Yang Chufu, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* recorded: "Jin killed its grandee Yang Chufu"—this was an omission in the superior’s words. If the ruler is not discreet, he loses his ministers, hence it records the state killing.

When one attains the qi of harmony, hardness and softness are balanced. If yang is excessive, one becomes overly hard; if yin is excessive, one becomes overly soft.

Did the author of the *Changes* understand the thief? The sage understands the principles of the world’s myriad things and unifies them with the One.

To oversee the lowly from a position of honor is called "overseeing"; to observe the lowly from above is called "observing."

"Do not conjecture, do not be inflexible, do not be obstinate, do not be self-centered"—taken together, these are one; taken separately, they are two. Taken together, they are two; taken separately, they are four.

Beginning with self-interest, one ends with self-centeredness. Self-interest gives rise to inflexibility; inflexibility is born of self-interest. Obstinacy gives rise to self-centeredness; self-centeredness is born of obstinacy. Self-interest has the mind’s inflexibility as its precondition; obstinacy does not transform the self, which is already fixed.

Learning by rote inquiry is insufficient to constitute a great enterprise. Learning lies in unceasing effort, which is why Wang Tong devoted himself to it until the end of his life.
