**First Chapter**

On the mid-autumn night of the *renyin* year of the Qianlong reign of the Great Qing, the moon shone bright and stars were sparse. Wu Yuan sat in silent meditation atop Xi Yun Peak, his spirit entering the dim and boundless realm, his form returning to the void and desolate state.

**[Collation Note:**
Here, the state merges with the mysterious—gates open and mountains appear, allowing deep entry. How lively it is! Within this, the "true midnight" (*zhengzi*) and "living midnight" (*huozi*) leap forth as if illuminated. Scholars must not read this as mere narrative.

This is not narration but a subtle revelation of the profound function at this very moment! The "Master" is the Master; do not take him as Wu Yuanzi. If understood as the disciples standing by, then the meaning of "Master" here is grasped. The essence lies in "not moving," "soundless," and "scentless," enabling the transition from awakening to forgetting. Thus, at midnight, one disciple arises and asks—a question with substance. The character *zi* (子) is not empty phrasing. The disciple moves, and his words emerge before the gate. Therefore, three questions receive no answer, for the answer lies within. Clearly, this is a vivid depiction of the yang stirring within stillness, an unparalleled image of the profound state.

Two thousand five hundred call him "Master." The Master does not move, makes no sound, emits no scent—yet there is one who observes. Who is this "one"? The Wu Yuanzi within the disciple. Know that the disciple’s question arises from within the gate. His mouth has three aspects: Heaven, Earth, and Human. Three as one is attainment; one as three is loss. Hence, three questions and three silences. The word "answer" holds great profundity. If not returned to the One, the answer loses its home—how could it be otherwise? Thus I say: "Three questions and three silences—the answer lies within." Scholars, take heed.]

The disciple again entreated, saying: "The Master utters not a single word—is this not like carving rotten wood or daubing a wall of dung, unworthy of discourse?"

Wu Yuanzi gazed intently for a long while, then replied with composure: "This is not what you can comprehend."

The disciple asked: "May I dare inquire the reason?"

Wu Yuanzi said: "I take heaven and earth as an inn, the sun and moon as passing guests, the myriad things as drifting threads, worldly affairs as dreams and illusions, human sentiments as bandits and foes, wealth and honor as floating clouds, the bodily form as withered branches, the Four Great Elements as deadwood, the six senses as hollow apertures, body and mind as ashes and dust—what movement? What stirring? What sound? What scent?"

[Verification: This response merely explains how one may attain immutability and the absence of sound or scent—yet in truth, it marks the initial step in awakening to the "Mysterious Pass." Wu Yuanzi longed to reveal it outright, but seeing the world mired in delusion, he could find no opening for swift admonition. Thus, he first instructed in relinquishing body and mind, hinting at the wondrous function of "borrowing the false to cultivate the true," which lies in treating the six senses as apertures. For when all is seen through, the mind’s resolve becomes singular. At that moment, one penetrates the realm of the subtle and imperceptible precisely through the apertures of the six thieves! Alas, why do seekers fail to comprehend? This is the universal malady of the age—there is no remedy but to guide them step by step.]

The disciple asked: "According to the Master’s words, is there then nothing at all?"

Wu Yuanzi replied: "How could there be nothing?"

The disciple asked: "What, then, is there?"

Wu Yuanzi said: "Only the knowledge of the Dao."

The disciple asked: "Is the Dao, then, without action?"

Wu Yuanzi replied: "How could it be without action? The Dao has substance and function, advance and retreat, opposition and compliance, urgency and slowness, cessation and fulfillment, beginning and end, priority and sequence, interweaving and layering, transformation and myriad great works and functions—how could it be without action?"

The disciple said: "This disciple has entered the Dao for many years, perused countless alchemical scriptures, and sought instruction from many teachers, yet remains utterly ignorant. I implore the Master’s compassion to slightly open my benighted mind."

Wu Yuanzi said: "The Dao is what heaven and earth conceal, what spirits and gods envy—it cannot be discussed lightly. Without purification and fasting, one must not presume to listen."

The disciple bowed and withdrew to perform the fast:

First, the fast of the body, wherein the Four Great Elements are unattached.
Second, the fast of the mind, wherein all thoughts are stilled.
Third, the fast of the eyes, wherein the light is turned inward in reflection.
Fourth, the fast of the ears, wherein no sound enters.
Fifth, the fast of the nose, wherein no fragrance or stench reaches.
Sixth, the fast of the tongue, wherein right and wrong stir not.

Having completed the six fasts, the disciple again approached and entreated, "This disciple has fasted! I now dare ask of the Dao."

Wu Yuanzi said: "Not yet. There remains one fast unfulfilled—how dare you ask?"

The disciple said: "Beyond these six fasts, what other fast is there? I beg the Master to make it clear."

Wu Yuanzi replied: "There is yet the fast of the heart’s realm. This realm is fouler than the six senses. The six senses are external thieves, coming and going at times. The heart’s realm is an internal thief, wherein the consciousness-demon dwells, the seed of kalpas of rebirth. Without fasting this realm, the six fasts are of no avail."

[Verification: Do not say the six fasts are of no avail—they are merely all acts of intention. When fasting reaches the heart, arising naturally, it may then be called true fasting. If these six fasts each arise naturally, they may be named the fast of the heart.]

The disciple, greatly startled, withdrew.

Thereupon, sweeping clean the myriad conditions, departing from all extremes, he responded with no abiding and gave rise to the mind. In that instant, it was as though frozen ice dissolved, leaving no residue.

Again, with utmost sincerity, he knelt before the Master and inquired: "By your compassion, Master, I have fasted the fastless fast, the fast beyond fasting. Fasting yet not fasting, not fasting yet fasting; not fasting—who fasts? Who fasts this fast? Not fasting *is* the fast. Knowing the fast is not the fast, the fast is without fast to fast. If one seeks the true fast, the fast does not see the fast. Since the fast is without fast, why force a fast?"

Wu Yuanzi replied: "You know the fast! You have fasted! You may now inquire of the Dao, you may now hear the Dao."

[Verification: When merit reaches this point, the body of the Dao appears in full—one touch and enlightenment dawns. If one were to recognize this from the outset, neither being nor non-being would arise, both person and dharma would be forgotten, and one would advance to the boundless realm of nothingness, naturally entering the infinite domain of transformation. Body and mind would merge with the workings of creation as one. Further, if one were to disperse the fast for forty-nine days without losing this state, when the time is ripe and the opportunity arises, one would spontaneously realize the natural attainment of the six supernatural powers. How could the primordial be obscured, or the embryo fail to form and perfect?

Such guidance could swiftly elevate one to the supreme knowledge of virtue. Yet here, the Master merely assents that knowing the fast and having fasted suffice to inquire of and hear the Dao, neither directly illuminating the truth nor urging progress. Had he tested the disciple on the spot, seizing the moment with a shout or a blow, all would have been settled at once. Instead, this opportunity was lost—how lamentable!

For such an advanced disciple, capable of self-exertion and diligent progress, the threshold of innate knowledge lay but a hair’s breadth away. Had I encountered such a one, I would have seized the moment, riding the wave of their fervor with skillful guidance, surely achieving extraordinary results. Even if obstacles arose, the "mysterious pass" would have opened wide and remained so. The practices of gathering, nurturing, and liberation would then unfold with each question, each illumination. The essential principle lies in non-abiding, non-attachment, and awakening without clinging.

Did Master Wu Yuan not grasp this? Perhaps he framed this exchange merely to clarify the supreme Dao. Yet even if such a high disciple had appeared, they would not have missed the opportunity as this one did.]

Someone asked, "What is the Dao?"

The master answered: "The Dao is the primordial ancestral qi that gives birth to all things. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped. It encompasses heaven and earth, gives life to the myriad beings. Vast, it has no exterior; minute, it has no interior. In Confucianism, it is called the Supreme Ultimate; in Daoism, the Golden Elixir; in Buddhism, Perfect Enlightenment. It has no name, yet we forcefully call it the Dao. To liken it is to miss it; to discuss it is to lose it. It is without form, without image, neither form nor emptiness, neither being nor non-being. Should one cling to the appearances of form, emptiness, being, or non-being, it is no longer the Dao."

[Verification: Note: The answer reveals the fundamental essence of the Dao. Presented in full, this is the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir—scholars now know what to pursue! Its essential meaning lies in non-attachment: to awaken without clinging, and that is all.]

Someone asked, "If the Dao is without form or image, being but a singular qi, why does the *Book of Changes* say, 'That which consists of one yin and one yang is called the Dao'?"

The master answered: "The phrase 'That which consists of one yin and one yang is called the Dao' speaks of the Dao in its function. 'Without form or image' speaks of the Dao in its essence. Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, the Dao encompassed yin and yang. After the Supreme Ultimate divided, yin and yang gave birth to the Dao. Without yin and yang, the qi of the Dao would not manifest. Only through the alternating movement of yin and yang does the qi of the Dao endure, remaining unharmed through ten thousand changes. In the realm of the primordial, it is the Dao; in the realm of the manifest, it is yin and yang. The Dao is the root of yin and yang; yin and yang are the expression of the Dao. This is what is meant by 'The Supreme Ultimate divides into yin and yang; yin and yang unite to form the Supreme Ultimate'—one becomes two, two become one."

Someone asked, "If the Supreme Ultimate divides into yin and yang, does that not make two yin-yang pairs? Why then do the ancients speak of two layers of heaven and earth, and four yin-yang pairs?"

The master answered: "The two layers of heaven and earth refer to the primordial and the manifest. The four yin-yang pairs refer to the primordial and manifest yin and yang. Primordial yin and yang are spoken of in terms of qi; manifest yin and yang are spoken of in terms of substance. Primordial yin and yang are the yin and yang contained within the Supreme Ultimate; manifest yin and yang are the yin and yang generated from the Supreme Ultimate. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir takes the qi, not the substance, returning from the manifest to the primordial—hence it is called 'the primordial Great Dao.'"

Someone asked, "If the primordial and the manifest, yin and yang, each have their boundaries, how can one speak of returning from the manifest to the primordial?"

The master answered: "Once the primordial is broken, manifest yin and yang arise. Yet within the movement and stillness of manifest yin and yang, the primordial is again generated. The perfected one, within the manifest, gathers that newly generated primordial qi, reverses its course, and circulates it to return to the origin and restore the wholeness of the Supreme Ultimate—this is called 'the Returned Elixir.'"

Someone asked, "Since yin and yang are already divided into primordial and manifest, why then speak of inner yin-yang and outer yin-yang?"

The master answered: "Inner yin-yang refers to the manifest yin and yang generated within the physical form. Outer yin-yang refers to the primordial yin and yang emerging from emptiness. The yin and yang of the physical form are the sequentially circulating yin and yang, born of Heaven and Earth. The yin and yang of emptiness are the reversely circulating yin and yang, generating Heaven and Earth. The terms 'inner' and 'outer' refer to their function."

Someone asked, "If yin and yang have inner and outer aspects, do the Five Phases also have inner and outer aspects?"

The master answered: "The Five Phases arise from yin and yang. If yin and yang have inner and outer aspects, how could the Five Phases not? Consider the ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches, each of which embodies dual Five Phases. Taking the Heavenly Stems: *bing* is yang fire, *ding* is yin fire; *jia* is yang wood, *yi* is yin wood; *geng* is yang metal, *xin* is yin metal; *ren* is yang water, *gui* is yin water; *wu* is yang earth, *ji* is yin earth. Taking the Earthly Branches: *hai* water is yang, *zi* water is yin; *yin* wood is yang, *mao* wood is yin; *si* fire is yang, *wu* fire is yin; *shen* metal is yang, *you* metal is yin; *chen* and *xu* earth are yang, *chou* and *wei* earth are yin. Yang is outer, belonging to the primordial; yin is inner, belonging to the manifest. This is how the primordial and manifest are distinguished, and how inner and outer elixirs differ."

Someone asked, "Inner elixir completes nature, outer elixir completes life—does this mean cultivating nature and life occur at different times? The *Book of Changes* says, 'Before Heaven, do not oppose it; after Heaven, follow its timing.' This suggests reverse practice and sequential movement are unrelated. Why then does the *Mirror for Compounding the Elixir* say, 'Primordial qi, manifest qi—who attains them is ever as if drunk'?"

The master answered: "The patriarchs, in their compassion, spoke plainly—you simply fail to awaken. Completing nature with the inner elixir is 'after Heaven, follow its timing.' Completing life with the outer elixir is 'before Heaven, do not oppose it.' Employing the reverse path, one takes preemptive control to seize creation and form the elixir. Following timing means using the sequential path, the natural fire-phase, to harmonize the Five Phases and release the elixir. These two stages of practice are what is meant by 'dual cultivation of nature and life.' Cultivating inner and outer together is 'employing both reverse and sequential.'"

Someone asked, "Are nature as yin and life as yang the yin and yang divided from the Supreme Ultimate?"

The master answered: "This requires distinction. Nature includes both temperament-bound nature and Heaven-endowed nature. Life includes both predetermined life and Dao-qi life. Temperament-bound nature and predetermined life are the manifest, embodied nature and life. Heaven-endowed nature and Dao-qi life are the primordial, formless nature and life. Cultivating manifest nature and life follows creation. Cultivating primordial nature and life reverses creation. The great practitioner borrows the manifest to return to the primordial, cultivates the primordial to transform the manifest, merging them into one—nature and life congeal, and this is called 'elixir accomplished.' Nature and life are the substance of yin and yang; yin and yang are the function of nature and life. There are only distinctions of authenticity and falsity, primordial and manifest—one must discern carefully and recognize clearly."

Someone asked, "If nature and life depend on yin and yang to congeal, then where there is yin, yang cannot be absent, and where there is yang, yin cannot be absent. Why then speak of 'when the host of yin is exhausted, the elixir ripens'? In the end, is yin used or not?"

The master answered: "What is used is true yin and true yang; what is not used is false yin and false yang. True yin and true yang belong to the primordial; false yin and false yang belong to the manifest. The primordial accomplishes the Dao; the manifest corrupts the Dao."

Someone asked, "What is true yin and true yang? What is false yin and false yang?"

The master answered: "Yin within yang is true yin; yang within yin is true yang—these are the yin and yang that are used, what the ancient classics call 'yin and yang of the same kind.' Excessive yang without yin is false yang; solitary yin without yang is false yin—these are the yin and yang that are not used, what the ancient classics call 'solitary yin, widowed yang.'"

The *Elixir Classic* states: *"Of the same kind, effort is easily applied; not of the seed, skill is vainly sought."* These two lines contain the entire method! Contemplating this "kind," one knows to seek the same kind within the primordial. Heaven and earth generate humanity, and dragons and tigers are boundless—among them, those whose stars and destiny align with the tide are likewise innumerable and may be met and gathered. Yet whether they can be seen or not determines feasibility. This Dao is known only to our Northern Lineage. As for the "seed," its meaning is even more refined! Without thoroughly understanding and applying the principle of the seed, one merely invites the ridicule of "boiling water and fire in vain." Those who read this critique should not skim it carelessly. Yet this method of gathering is not merely a matter of "not loosening the belt or removing the robe"! Its scope is vast as the Yin and Ebi rivers—within a hundred *li*, though faces never meet nor appointments made, it is like a magnet drawing iron, as if they sat side by side. Only when the "Mysterious Pass" opens does one act without delusion or illusion.

Someone asked: "The mutual resonance of yin and yang is the natural Dao of heaven and earth. Why then are there solitary and widowed states?"

The master answered: "I have already spoken of this! When yin and yang resonate, they are true yin and true yang; when they do not, they are false yin and false yang. The distinction between true and false lies solely in 'resonance' and 'non-resonance.'"

Someone asked: "Since the Dao of yin-yang resonance arises naturally, why is cultivation necessary?"

The master answered: "Postnatal yin and yang sometimes resonate and sometimes do not. The sage’s primordial learning reverses within the natural flow, ensuring perpetual resonance without dispersion. Thus, humans can overcome heaven and are not bound by yin and yang."

[**Collateral Evidence**: This answer should follow Master Ma Danyang’s *Secret Principles of Returning to the Origin*, avoiding deviation. It speaks of deep plowing to plant the seed, ensuring unwavering irrigation—this is the waiting. When human mechanism and timing align, it is called "heaven and human unite in activation," allowing one to borrow illusion to grasp the profound. Within this turning point, even spirits and gods cannot fathom it. Without a moment of primordial chaos, completion cannot be achieved; without placing body and mind beyond their bounds, there will be dangers of "flight and escape." Ancestor Zhong handled this with perfect ease, while Ancestor Lü gained it three times and lost it thrice. The key lies in the two words "clarity and harmony," which regulate and sustain, bringing everlasting spring in all seasons—human determination triumphs over heaven. Is this not the so-called primordial learning? By preceding heaven in every step and matter, one ensures that when the time comes, one does not lag behind. Do not indulge in wild speculation, lest you stray onto the wrong path. Though Wu Yuanzi has touched upon this, he did not lay it bare entirely. Fearing that later learners would still struggle amid thorns, I have thus expounded and supplemented it.]

Someone asked: "Does the resonance of yin and yang occur internally or externally?"

The master answered: "Yes. Postnatal yin and yang resonate internally; primordial yin and yang resonate externally. The internal arises naturally; the external arises through effort."

[**Collateral Evidence**: If discussing postnatal resonance, it entirely depends on reversal, yet the answer calls it "natural"; if discussing primordial resonance, it entirely depends on non-action, yet the answer calls it "effort." Is this distinguishing the internal and external of the two-colored body? Or the internal and external of the illusory Dharma-body’s qi resonance? From the perspective of the two illusions: the yang illusion conceals primordial yin, and the yin illusion conceals primordial yang. If proceeding from the primordial, one must reverse the flow—hence "effort"; if proceeding from the postnatal, one follows the natural course—hence "natural." Such an answer is broad and seems not to reflect Wu Yuanzi’s original intent. It should be understood in terms of the illusory Dharma-body’s qi resonance to reveal its subtlety. According to the elixir method: what takes form and has image is called postnatal and internal; what is soundless and scentless is called primordial and external. When the two illusions meet, spirit congeals and qi coalesces—this arises naturally. When pent-up energy bursts outward, reaching the void’s edge, this too arises naturally. Then, the Supreme Ultimate responds, and the primordial surges abundantly, filling the two illusions. The profound circumstances within are beyond description. Ancestor Lü’s three gains and three losses occurred precisely at this moment! One must proceed step by step in accord with effort to attain perfect stability. This is the true purport of Wu Yuanzi’s "effort"—scholars must not take it lightly.]

Question: "When speaking of external yin and yang, it must relate to this body of mine. Some say it lies in Heaven and Earth, others say it lies in another’s household—are these correct?"

Answer: "Fools, not understanding the meaning of 'external,' either ingest the qi of Heaven and Earth’s clouds and mist or extract the impure blood of women’s red lead and plum-blossom drops. Abandoning the upright for the perverse, they commit a hundred evils. Little do they know that 'external' encompasses Heaven and Earth, meaning it does not belong to me. At the beginning of life, it was originally my own possession, but once the primordial unity was broken, the false took charge while the true withdrew, growing ever more distant until it had no connection to me—hence it is called 'external.' This secret is difficult to recognize without encountering a true teacher."

[Verification: What is refuted here is correct. Yet this secret matter must be sought from its own kind. "Internal" and "external" are spoken of from the present perspective, but in truth, it is one thing—where are yin and yang, internal and external? Proceeding from the primordial as one’s foundation, Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, clouds, mist, red lead, plum-blossom drops—all their forms are false, but their qi is qi. How could qi be external qi? The ancient sages provided detailed guidance, all with wondrous uses, though not for beginners nor those who cling rigidly. Only by never straying step by step from the primordial can one trace back to what precedes the primordial. The Mysterious Pass opens in all directions; whatever one touches or encounters is none other than the primordial. It is like a vast gauze canopy of the Great Net, where every object is precious, all clearly visible. One need only possess a thousand hands and a thousand eyes to gather them at will. All that was lost is fully contained within. Yet without meeting a true teacher to open the Mysterious Pass beforehand and manifest this thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Dharma-body afterward, how could one recognize it? Wu Yuanzi guarded this secret closely. I therefore set it forth here to complete the record.]

Here is the translation:

---

Someone asked: “The primordial substance is distant from me, and if the body is purely yin, one cannot cling to this body in cultivation. Why then does the *Book of Changes* speak of ‘not far, returning to cultivate the body’?”

The master replied: “The Great Dao does not depart from this body, nor does it cling to it. Seeking it externally leads to heterodoxy, for what is not of the same kind as oneself is false. Seeking it within oneself, where only pure yin remains, is to be bound by the postnatal—yet there is a special method that can restore what is absent and return what has departed. This is what is called ‘returning to nothingness and reverting to the root.’”

[**Annotation for verification:** The mirror’s reflection here has been detailed in previous comments; those earlier remarks precisely address the unique method in this answer. Scholars should ponder this deeply, for when sincerely practiced, none will fail to verify it. To thoroughly grasp this special method, one must begin with Master Zhai’s single secret. Once this secret is mastered, proceed according to the oral instructions transmitted by Patriarch Ma, adding only the word *constancy*.]

Someone asked: “If the primordial substance is neither within nor outside the body, where exactly does it reside?”

The master replied: “It resides in the Mysterious Pass. The so-called Mysterious Pass is where the Four Great do not adhere—neither existent nor nonexistent, neither form nor emptiness, neither inside nor outside. It is also called the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the Abode of Life and Death, the Orifice of Yin and Yang, the Barrier of Birth and Death, the Chaos Cavern, the Altar of Dragon and Tiger, the Orifice of Tortoise and Snake, the Realm of Vagueness, the Land of Obscurity, the Gate of Inhalation and Exhalation, the Gate of Wu and Ji, and many other names—all referring to the ‘Orifice of the Mysterious Pass.’ Within the body, it is not the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys; not the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or intent; not the three hundred sixty joints nor the eighty-four thousand pores. Since ancient times, immortals have refused to clearly reveal it, leading to many heterodox schools that wildly speculate and privately discuss, all seeking it among the bodily forms—how grievously mistaken!

Now I will point it out to you: Know that this orifice lies where the Six Roots do not adhere, where the Five Phases do not reach. Vague and indistinct, within it is an orifice; obscure and profound, within it is a gate that opens and closes of itself. Call to it, and it responds; tap it, and it is efficacious. Bright and clear, it manifests fully formed. When deluded, it seems a thousand miles away; when awakened, it is right before you. Alas! To spiritually comprehend it depends on the individual—without decades of exhaustive inquiry into principle, one cannot perceive it.”

[**Annotation for verification:** This answer reveals that the master attained this stage through inquiry into principle, appearing to have grasped it yet not truly so. I, however, have witnessed it as described! The master’s error lies in reading books and exhausting principle. Those who recognize that practice begins with emptiness and stillness will know my words are not mistaken. The great flaw in this passage lies in the phrases “call to it” and “tap it,” and in later attributing its realization to exhaustive inquiry. This stage can only be entered through the two words *emptiness* and *stillness*. When the work reaches its utmost, all mysterious states must be perceived without attachment—what the ancient sages called “no thought, no deliberation.” Suddenly, one penetrates into the mysterious state, as if returning to one’s homeland, without the slightest surprise. Here, existence and nonexistence, movement and stillness, solidity and emptiness, form and void—all appear yet are not seen, are sensed yet not grasped. Whether the pass opens or not is not investigated. If one lingers even slightly, one falls into illusory delusion outside the orifice—this must be guarded against.

If one can silently abide by this secret, not a single thought arising, one suddenly awakens as from a dream. Boundless and without limit, unfathomable and beyond measure—this is what the ancient sages called “the initial state of the spirit truly entering the orifice.” Then, the mechanism suddenly merges into oneness—what the ancient sages called “the spirit forging into profound harmony.” Suddenly, one perceives all things with utter clarity, yet the center remains still—what the ancient sages called “the living primordial movement inherent in the Mysterious Orifice.”

This dynamic movement is precisely the initial mysterious state before the living midnight of the Zi hour. At this time, the practitioner must feel as though standing atop a towering peak, the eye’s reach boundless, vast and profound—what the ancient sages called “the mysterious state of the true Zi hour within the orifice.” Then, life and death interact, transformations endless, responding to myriad phenomena. Yet one remains still, the mind unmoved—what the ancient sages called “the living Wu hour within the orifice.”

At this stage, the method lies solely in advancing and withdrawing, gathering and returning to the primordial, preventing yin from overwhelming yang and thus attaining harmony. This also encompasses the bathing practice, constituting the true person, true resonance, and true response. For this Mysterious Orifice breathes in unison with creation—without utmost emptiness or profound stillness, there is no principle by which it can be entered. The ancient sages said that within it, “Heaven and Earth, the Five Phases, the Three Powers, yin and yang, and all birth and extinction are contained.” All great cultivators establish their foundation here. The six kinds of immortals—celestial, aquatic, terrestrial, human, divine, and demonic—all emerge from this. The Queen Mother’s *Ten Principles of Female Cultivation* expounds this fully. Its attainment arises from the resonance of mechanism and response.]

Someone asked: “The Mysterious Pass is said to be neither within nor outside the body, yet it is called the Orifice of Yin and Yang. Does the body itself not contain yin and yang?”

The master replied: “Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the Five Phases to form their bodies, which contain the qi of yin, yang, and the Five Phases. The numinous aspect of yin is the *po*; the numinous aspect of yang is the *hun*. The *hun* and *po* reside in the body like people in a house. The Mysterious Pass is the gate through which the *hun* and *po* enter and exit. Yet this gate has no form or appearance; it opens and closes within emptiness, and the *hun* and *po* likewise enter and exit within emptiness.”

The Mysterious Pass resides in emptiness, which is why it is neither within nor outside the body—even the body’s every movement and stillness occurs within emptiness. Thus, when you quietly reflect: How does this body walk? How does it stand? How does it sit, how does it lie? How does it speak? How does it remain silent? How does it bend? How does it extend? All such actions emerge from the Mysterious Pass. Where, then, does this subtle mechanism truly lie? If one can truly know it, it becomes the gateway of yin and yang, through which one may preserve life and destiny.

[Verification: It must be noted that this Mysterious Orifice cannot be grasped through conjecture. For this orifice is no ordinary orifice—it lies beyond the boundary of the precelestial and postcelestial. Yet according to the *Scriptures of the Elixir*, "Where the thought stirs is the Mysterious Female," so this Mysterious Orifice must ultimately be sought before the spine and behind the palace of the mind, in emptiness and stillness, awaiting the fruition of practice. Naturally, it will manifest without fail. This teaching was transmitted by the world-abiding immortals, the Perfected Ones Huang and Li, and has often proven spiritually efficacious. Not daring to keep it for myself, I humbly record it here.]

Question: "Since yin and yang reside within the body, the cultivation of one’s nature and destiny lies within oneself and cannot be borrowed from others. Why then did the ancients say, *'Do not claim this body as the Dao; you must recognize the deathless method of another household'*?"

Answer: "This refers to the postcelestial realm! From the very beginning of life, nature and destiny are one household, yin and yang a single qi. As one gradually grows and reaches the age of sixteen, the yang qi becomes full, and a single yin subtly arises. Thus, Qian and Kun interact: Qian, being empty, becomes Li, while Kun, being solid, becomes Kan. Within Li lies the nature, and within Kan lies the destiny. Kan has sunken its true essence, like a tiger fleeing to dwell in the west. Destiny is no longer my own possession—it is merely a thing of pure yin! If one clings to this body in cultivation, one merely refines the postcelestial essence and qi. How then can one attain the fully realized body of pure yang? Therefore, one must seek the deathless method of another household, which is the single yang essence sunken within Kan. Because Kan has sunken, it is not my own possession, hence it is called 'another household'—not some external household outside the body. To fixate on what lies outside the body is to slander the sacred Dao and will condemn one to the hell of having one’s tongue plucked. As Master Yuanduzi said, *'A single yang essence is hidden within the mountain of form, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the Mysterious Pass of the single orifice.'* This is the truth."

[Verification: This answer still pertains to the initial methods of stabilizing the foundation in the teachings of earthly immortals. Yet if the Mysterious Pass does not open, all efforts will be in vain. The late Master Taixu said: "Master Yuanduzi, though a Confucian who received the true transmission, regrettably kept some secrets. Yet when he said, *'Not in the heart or kidneys, but in the Mysterious Pass of the single orifice,'* he had already revealed what should not have been revealed—though not fully, just enough to mislead others." Such was the critique of the late master.

Now, considering Master Wuyuan’s answer, was he not also misled by these earlier teachings? Those earlier teachings were spoken with intent. Only our Southern School’s Patriarch Niwan Chen saw through them. Patriarch Chen lamented, saying, *"Patriarch Ziyang Zhang’s intent was not universal."* If even the sagely Patriarch Ziyang Zhang was misled by these teachings, how much more so Master Yuandu Zhao!

Having read his works, I note that he records an *Unobstructed Buddhist Assembly* and states, *"Without the true transmission, how can one know the method of gathering and refining?"* Thus, Master Zhao must have heard this true method of gathering and refining, yet like Master Wuyuan, he feared divine retribution and so revealed only this much. Still, when he said, *"Not in the heart or kidneys, but in the Mysterious Pass of the single orifice,"* he subtly hinted at the method.

For later students whose original qi is deficient and broken, only deep plowing and planting the seed will allow them to borrow the illusory to grasp the mysterious. Without deep plowing and planting, there is no way to return to the root and restore the original. To deep plow, one begins with the Three Observations. When the Three Observations are mastered, one can then plant the seed. What is the seed? It is the same kind. Recognizing the same kind and being skilled in gathering and refining, the embryo still depends on knitting and rounding—how could it merely stabilize the original?

Yet without guidance from beginning to end, none will avoid falling into heterodox teachings. I have heard the late Master Taixu say: "The prevalence of heterodox teachings stems from the failure to break through the pass. Those who do not recognize their kind cannot break through. The direct pointing to breaking through the pass is nothing other than placing this body and mind before the precelestial, practicing until one reaches the state of effortless spontaneity. Without exerting effort, the Mysterious Pass will naturally open, and one will see and enter it of itself. One must only guard against attachment to form or thought, and against missing it when it appears before one’s eyes.

When the initial glimpse of the practice arises, if a single thought stirs at the moment of seeing, the Mysterious Pass will instantly vanish. The wondrous state within is such that it must change with every thought, leading to the risk of losing the center. The method is simply to place one’s spirit and consciousness in a state of not-knowing and not-awareness. When one reaches the point where ten thousand thoughts do not arise and the single numinous spirit is also extinguished, one has entered the ultimate state of primordial chaos—this is the stage of deeply entering the Mysterious Orifice.

Suddenly, a thought stirs. In stillness, one observes and senses a response like breath—unstruck, it resonates of itself. This is the sign of the first stirring of yang. One must maintain absolute stillness, yet guard against the flaw of rigid fixation. The method is to merge movement and penetrate inward—this is the moment when the Mysterious Pass opens wide. If one falls into rigid fixation, the ancients called it 'stiffening within and without.'

At this stage of practice, the state will soon resemble spring and summer, with the warmth of the sun and the harmony of the wind, flowers bright and willows dark. If one becomes truly deaf and blind, sealing the six gates and leaving not a single orifice open, this is missing the opportunity. If one indulges in reckless wandering and loses one’s original nature, this is chasing after phenomena and will lead to self-deception. The method is to expand the true original qi, merging it with the original qi of the environment, while inwardly preserving one’s intent. With a single-minded focus on inner emptiness and stillness, one will sense an ineffable, profound moistening within. External phenomena may be manifold, but one merely listens without attachment—this is the wondrous state of the practice reaching high noon, when ten thousand paths open simultaneously.

The method is to retreat from yin, yet this is nothing more than inwardly storing one’s intent. The original qi will naturally return to the cave like clouds gathering in a valley, where one sees only rosy clouds swirling in the empty gorge. Suddenly, harmony turns to solemnity—this is the wondrous state of the *shen-you* hours.

In prolonged stillness and observation, the state manifests the image of winter, corresponding to the first line of the *Qian* hexagram. At this stage, the student must not stop. The method is to gather the spirit at the lowest point, so that the practice fills the entire body with harmony. Then, one may cease effortlessly—this is the initial method of the Mysterious Pass. After practicing thus for a hundred days, one may then consider advancing further.

Regarding the methods of planting the seed, those with strength may prepare the original seed in advance, while those without strength may retreat into seclusion amidst the marketplace. Ultimately, nothing surpasses forming an *Unobstructed Buddhist Assembly* to achieve completion—whether in seclusion or in the world, each will attain the supreme and wondrous function.]

As stated above, this accomplishes only the first step of "deep plowing," which the ancient sages called the foundational beginning of both *xing*-study and *ming*-study. This is the great Dao that Master Wu Yuan kept secret and never revealed. Fearing that later students might stray onto wrong paths and remain irredeemable for life, I have thus supplemented it here. Yet this is the oral transmission sworn in mountain vows and sea pledges by the ancient sages and perfected ones, imparted only at midnight and never before committed to writing. Students who encounter it must not treat it lightly.

Its essence lies entirely in the single step of "deep plowing":
If the work of deep plowing is shallow, the harvest will be meager;
If the work of deep plowing is mature, the harvest will fill the granary.
This is the ultimate principle—take care not to mislead yourself.

As for "planting the seed," it means constructing a living dragon and tiger within the cinnabar chamber to attract the true original *qi*:
For men, it draws forth the *qi* of *Kun*;
For women, it draws forth the *qi* of *Qian*.
When the two original *qi* mutually resonate in the empty space, something must be born.
Using my own medium, I guide them to unite within, forming a couple—this is the way of immortals to prolong life.

Only by expanding my *yin* and *e* boundaries, internally resonating with the Three Origins, borrowing the true fire within the false, stripping away *yin* to retain *yang*;
Refining day by day and month by month, forging them into one, acting in due time;
Drawing forth the response of the *Kun* Mother, who by decree bestows the True One of the human origin to unite within me—true matching true virtue—naturally igniting the true fire.
Refining the living millet pearl, guiding it with intention to descend into the Central Yellow Axis, like a pearl spiraling amidst radiant clouds and protective mists, stored as if a woman with child—this is the formation of the embryo.

The method lies solely in emptiness and stillness to preserve it, and thereafter only in daily warmth and timely nurturing.
Through such cultivation, when the work reaches a state that is "one yet not one, two yet not two," this is the secret of attaining the achievement of heavenly immortality.

Such was the profound discourse of my teacher, the Great Void Elder.
This is the true and real function of what Master Wu Yuan called "the body of pure *yang* completion."
Yet if one follows only what the Master indicated, it remains the illusory mutual resonance of *qi* giving birth to the origin—one has not yet attained the body of pure *yang* completion.
The methods of fire timing and technique have also not been fully revealed.
Thus, I have set them forth here to supplement them.

Someone asked: "Are *xing* and *ming* attributed to *kan* and *li*? Is the heart *li* and the kidneys *kan*?"

The master replied: "These are the *kan* and *li* of the postnatal illusory body, not the *kan* and *li* of the prenatal Dharma-body. In the Dharma-body’s *kan* and *li*, *li* sheds its *yang* to become *li*, while *kan* entraps its true essence to become *kan*. When *li* sheds its *yang*, what remains must be *yin*. When *kan* entraps its true essence, what it conceals must be *yang*. *Li* is the solar soul, the image of radiant brightness, yet outwardly masculine and inwardly feminine—within its *hun* lies *po*. *Kan* is the lunar soul, the image of obscurity, yet outwardly dark and inwardly luminous—within its *po* lies *hun*. Here, *yin* and *yang* intermingle, embodying the centered and upright essence of *qian* and *kun*, forming true *yin* and true *yang*, the root of *xing* and *ming*. In the Dao of the Elixir, these two *qi* are gathered and united to form the true, transcending the mundane and entering the sacred. How could this be compared to the postnatal, tangible *kan* and *li*?"

Someone asked: "If *kan* and *li* are true *yin* and true *yang*, then in 'withdrawing from *kan* to fill *li*,' what *yang* is withdrawn, and what *yin* is filled?"

The master replied: "This refers to returning from the postnatal to the prenatal. The *yin* to be filled is the *yin* of my own household—postnatal and thus illusory. This *yin* consists of the sevenfold cinnabar within *li*: the bodily fluids of saliva, tears, semen, essence, *qi*, blood, and marrow. These seven numinous substances are difficult to retain even for a moment. The *yang* within *kan* is the property of the other household—true prenatal *yang*. Withdrawing this *yang* from *kan* to fill the illusory *yin* within *li* is like a cat seizing a mouse: it is using the prenatal to transform the postnatal, employing true *yang* to subdue illusory *yin*. One must not mistake illusory *yin* for true *yin*. Illusory *yin* is born of heaven and earth, while true *yin* gives birth to heaven and earth—how could they be confused?"

Someone asked: "May we hear the actual manifestations of true *yin-yang* and illusory *yin-yang*?"

The master replied: "True *yin-yang* is like a husband and wife united by a proper matchmaker. Illusory *yin-yang* is like a man and woman engaging in clandestine, illicit union. When such a secret affair is exposed, *xing* and *ming* are harmed—it is not merely unbeneficial but harmful. A union arranged by a matchmaker is open and upright, bearing sons and grandsons—who could break it? Who could ruin it? Thus, the accomplished one uses the true to achieve the work and rejects the illusory, for the true brings success while the illusory brings failure."

Someone asked: "In harmonizing *yin* and *yang*, the Yellow Dame serves as the matchmaker..."

Where does the Yellow Dame reside?"

The master replied: "In the central earth. The *Yijing* states: *'The yellow center penetrates principle.'* It is the central earth that harmonizes *yin-yang*, unites the Four Images, and gathers the Five Phases. Without this earth in cultivation, how could *yin* and *yang* harmonize? How could the Four Images unite? How could the Five Phases gather? It is precisely earth that serves as the bond of *yin-yang*, the Four Images, and the Five Phases. Thus, in the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each has eighteen days when earth reigns—this is to affirm its bond."

Someone asked: "Does earth have distinctions of true and illusory, precelestial and postcelestial?"

The master replied: "How could it not? Consider how each of the four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—has eighteen days when earth reigns. This earth is formless earth, belonging to the precelestial, the *qi* of earth. The earth of the great land is formed earth, belonging to the postcelestial, the substance of earth. *Qi* is true; substance is illusory. Not only is earth’s truth and falsity like this—so too are the Four Images and the Five Phases."

Someone asked: "If illusory earth is not used, how then does the illusory earth of the great land give birth to things?"

The master replied: "The true borrows the illusory to enact its work; the illusory borrows the true to take form. Without the illusory, the true does not manifest; without the true, the illusory does not appear. The illusory resides within the true; the true resides within the illusory. The Great Dao’s return from the postcelestial to the precelestial follows this same principle."

Someone asked: "If *kan* and *li* lack *wu* and *ji*, though they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form. Are these *wu* and *ji* earths merely alternate names for true and illusory?"

The master replied: "*Wu* and *ji* here refer to what I call the precelestial earth, not the postcelestial. For the precelestial has *wu* and *ji*, and the postcelestial also has *wu* and *ji*. In the precelestial, *li* contains *ji*, and *kan* contains *wu*. *Wu* is the earth of movement within stillness, belonging to *yang*; *ji* is the earth of stillness within movement, belonging to *yin*. What is called 'guarding the central palace' is the still earth. What is called 'drawing in the precelestial' is the moving earth. Possessing these two earths to unite *kan* and *li*, water and fire interact to congeal the elixir—this is the reverse path. In the postcelestial, the single *yin* in *li* is illusory *yin*, an improper *yin*, bright externally yet dark internally, an unquiet *ji* earth. The single *yang* in *kan* is illusory *yang*, an improper *yang*, where upright *qi* is obstructed and deviant *qi* flourishes, a recklessly moving *wu* earth. Possessing these two earths harms one’s *xing* and *ming*, so that water and fire do not interact, and the Dao is ruined. With such distinctions, how can they be discussed as one?"

"Someone asked: 'In the precelestial, are *wu* and *ji* earths used together or separately?'

The master replied: 'In terms of the Returned Elixir, one draws the external *wu* earth with the internal *ji* earth, seeking the other through the self to gather the medicine. In terms of the Great Elixir, one directs the external *wu* earth toward the internal *ji* earth, returning emotion to nature to congeal the embryo—this is their separate use.

When gathering the medicine, if the internal *ji* earth does not initiate, the external *wu* earth will not harmonize; if the external *wu* earth does not move, the internal *ji* earth will not respond. Only when internal and external work in unison does the medicine spontaneously arise from emptiness.

When congealing the embryo, if the internal *ji* earth does not welcome, the external *wu* earth cannot approach; if the external *wu* earth does not move, the internal *ji* earth cannot act. Only when movement and stillness become one does the embryo naturally form—this is their joint use.'

Someone asked: 'How does one distinguish the principles of the Returned Elixir and the Great Elixir?'

The master replied: 'The Returned Elixir returns to the original source, turning the postcelestial back into the precelestial. The Great Elixir cultivates the original source, giving rise to a tangible form within the formless.

After a person reaches the extreme of *yang* and generates *yin*, day by day, *yin* erodes *yang*, and the precelestial *qi* dissipates, its measure greatly diminished. The "return" involves using methods to pursue and gather it, gradually collecting and restoring its original measure—like something lost that is regained, something departed that is returned. This is the Returned Elixir.

Yet even when the original measure is restored, without refinement by fire, it cannot transform the formless into form or the insubstantial into substance. Therefore, after completing the Returned Elixir, one must reinstall the furnace and reestablish the crucible; lead is added to mercury, and mercury is nurtured by lead. Using the fire of natural truth, one refines it into something genuine, transforming it into an indestructible substance—coeternal with heaven and earth, rivaling the sun and moon in brilliance—only then is the original source fully attained. Otherwise, if one completes the Returned Elixir but does not cultivate the Great Elixir, though the original source is present, it will not be firm, and there will inevitably come a time when what was gained is lost again.'

[Collateral Evidence: Now, the final step of the Returned Elixir is the wondrous function of blending with the common. The path of the Elixir necessarily passes through this essential step, though its subtleties and tendencies vary—one cannot generalize.

Yet all are called "reinstalling the furnace and reestablishing the crucible." The terms "crucible" and "furnace" are metaphors. Master Wuyuan’s teachings follow the methods established since the Han and Tang dynasties, which have not traced back to the Supreme Heart School of the Most High, hence the talk of reinstalling and reestablishing.

Some follow the tale of Pei Hang, others the hidden wonders of Ancestor Xue—all are treading the essential path to perfect the wondrous practice. Only in the Supreme Heart School of the Most High does one stand firmly in the precelestial: the Returned Elixir is here, and the Great Elixir is also here—this is the non-dual Dharma gate, most refined and subtle, most profound and mysterious, yet also most ordinary and near.

Contemplating its subtleties, one finds vastness like the great sea, wonders like the sands of the Ganges. The scholar need only cultivate a thousand hands and a thousand eyes, forging an infinite and boundless Dharma treasury. Within this treasury lies a great jewel that absorbs gold—one selects and adopts it.

This jewel arises from the Limitless, formless and imageless, soundless and odorless. The ancient sages could not name it, so they called it "jewel" because it generates substance from the insubstantial, though it is not truly a stone. How could it be lodestone? A person’s true unity closely resembles it.

As for the thousand hands and thousand eyes, and the infinite and boundless Dharma treasury, these are forged through the work of self-mastery. The late master, Tai Xu, expounded thus. In essence, the method is nothing more than releasing the ten thousand conditions, focusing the mind on *kun*, and initiating the work—thus, thus. Not daring to be selfish, I humbly supplement what Master Wuyuan did not teach.]

Someone asked: 'Are the Returned Elixir and the Great Elixir the same as the internal and external medicines?'

The master replied: 'There are several interpretations. In terms of the beginning and end of the Elixir path, the art of extending life is the external medicine, while the way of completing nature is the internal medicine. Without the external medicine, one cannot shed the illusory body; without the internal medicine, one cannot shed the Dharma body. The external medicine congeals the embryo, while the internal medicine liberates it.

In terms of the Returned Elixir, *kan* is the external medicine, and *li* is the internal medicine. In terms of the Great Elixir, true lead is the external medicine, and true mercury is the internal medicine. The words of the ancients each have their referents—one must not cling to the letter or fixate on images.'

Someone asked: 'True lead resides in *kan*, true mercury in *li*—once the Returned Elixir is congealed, lead and mercury have merged. Why then does the Great Elixir again involve lead and mercury? Are there not four leads and mercuries?'

The master replied: 'In the Returned Elixir, the lead in *kan* and the mercury in *li* are the precelestial lead and mercury hidden within the postcelestial. Extracting this lead and mercury is called the Returned Elixir, also known as the Golden Elixir, the True Seed, or True Lead. It touches the *yin* mercury of one’s self like a lodestone attracting iron.

This mercury is the sevenfold cinnabar within *li*. When mercury receives the *qi* of lead, it dries in an instant. Later, using the natural true fire within the already-dead true mercury, one nurtures it for ten months, applying the method of withdrawal and addition. The *qi* of lead flies away in flakes, leaving only a single essence of numinous cinnabar—pure *yang* without *yin*, and the Dharma body is complete.'

Someone asked: 'The Golden Elixir is formed by the union of lead and mercury. If one says mercury restrains lead, yet also speaks of nurturing for ten months until lead flies away and mercury dries—is this not contradictory?'

The master replied: 'This celestial mechanism has bewildered countless scholars throughout the ages. Among thousands, who truly understands it?'"

This numinous cinnabar is a primordial, supremely yang substance. Yet when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises, and the primordial enters the postnatal—within the true, the false appears. Without the true lead from another source to restrain it, this numinous cinnabar will never truly belong to me. For within true lead lies the primordial true unity of *qi*; when this lead-*qi* touches my numinous mercury, the mercury naturally ceases to flee. Once this mercury is dead, if the lead-*qi* is not fully withdrawn, the numinous cinnabar will not congeal.

Why is this so? Though lead is a primordial *qi*, it emerges from the postnatal—outwardly yin yet inwardly yang—carrying residual yin within! Only when this yin-*qi* is entirely drawn out can it become firm, strong, and upright, revealing a single grain of millet-like precious pearl, radiant within and without, penetrating heaven and earth. When released, it pervades the six directions; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy. As *Wuzhen* states:
*"To use lead, do not use common lead;
Once true lead is used, it too is discarded.
This is the wondrous secret of using lead—
To use lead is not to use it: these are truthful words."*

From this, one may grasp the meaning of using lead!

[Collateral Evidence:
If this is how lead is used, then the use of mercury may be inferred! If lead and mercury operate thus, then the four images, five phases, heaven, earth, humanity, and the myriad things—do they not all follow the same principle? This is the meaning of using *qi* without clinging to form. Here, one advances further still—this is the great Dao of using the primordial and not the postnatal!

This is what it means to comprehend the wondrous principle of return. Practitioners should embody and enact it. As the *Classic* says:
*"Refine essence to transform it into *qi*,
Refine *qi* to transform it into spirit,
Refine spirit to return to emptiness,
Refine emptiness to merge with the Dao,
Refine the Dao to emerge as spontaneity."*

Such is the sequence of return. When return reaches this stage, one may master life and death! Without attaining this, one will inevitably encounter demons and regress, retreating to the point of resigning to fate—how lamentable!

In examining its function, it all begins with exhausting the self. There has never been one who failed to exhaust the self yet could fully realize nature and fulfill destiny. Such was the teaching left by my master, the Great Void Elder.]

"Question: 'Do the *Returned Elixir* and the *Great Elixir* differ, and do their firing times also differ?'

Answer: 'They do differ. The firing time for the *Returned Elixir* lies in the *Living Zi Hour*, while that for the *Great Elixir* lies in the *True Zi Hour*. The *Living Zi Hour* does not fixate on the *Zi* and *Wu* moments within the marked hours. The *True Zi Hour* governs the completion of the elixir within a single two-hour period. As for the *Zi* and *Wu* within marked hours, at every moment there is the mechanism of yin’s birth and yang’s growth—advancing yang upon encountering *Zi*, retreating yin upon encountering *Wu*. As the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *"Within a single day, the twelve hours—wherever intention reaches, all may serve."* This speaks of gauging yin and yang’s waxing and waning through intention, precisely the *Living Zi Hour* of gathering medicine without fixation on marked hours.'

The elixir’s completion in a single hour occurs when, in this hour, one’s virtue merges with Heaven and Earth, one’s clarity merges with the sun and moon, one’s sequence merges with the four seasons, and one’s fortune merges with ghosts and spirits. It is difficult to attain yet easy to lose, tied to life and death, bound to nature and destiny. The perfected one, in this hour, exerts great effort and releases great mechanism. The numbers of Heaven and Earth are exhausted, the numbers of the myriad things are exhausted. They drive the dragon to the tiger, harness the tiger to ride the dragon, enter the Yellow Chamber, and congeal the supreme treasure. This is the *True Zi Hour* of elixir formation and harmonization.'

Question: 'How does one recognize the arrival of the *Living Zi Hour* and the *True Zi Hour*?'

Answer: 'How could one not know how to act? Taking the *Living Zi Hour* as an example: the precelestial true yang is obscured by the postcelestial, unable to manifest on its own. Even if it occasionally arises, it is mixed with human desire and thus lost as soon as it appears. Why? Because one mistakes the false for the true!'"

At this moment when the perfected one’s primordial yang first stirs, one applies the method to pursue and gather it, gradually drawing and collecting until the medicine accumulates sufficiently. Then one warms and nurtures it, until qi is full and spirit complete. When the *True Zi Hour* arrives, the great medicine arises. With a moment’s effort, one gathers and ingests it, whereupon it unites with one’s true mercury, restoring the primordial chaos of qi—this is the convergence with the great transformation of creation. After ingesting the elixir, for seven days one abides in chaos, dying and reviving, transmuting the postcelestial hexagrams, revealing the root and sprout of the precelestial. Thus one passes from effortful practice into effortlessness.

[Collateral Evidence: This passage expounds a method originating after the Qin and Han dynasties, hence its various allusions to Zhang. The practice is intricate and arduous, its effects elusive; among ten thousand practitioners, scarcely one succeeds. The flaw lies in failing to establish a foundation prior to the precelestial. Its methods emphasize deliberate action and application, yet the qi of the precelestial is never encountered. What it calls chaos is merely yang submerged in yin, requiring seven days for yang to emerge. Yet if one attains spiritual transformation, how would the world recognize it? Still, such practices align not even slightly with the great Dao. Our tradition warns against them; though our virtue is meager, we dare not endorse them.

Our master, the Venerable Tai Xu, also discussed this, noting that such methods—whether solitary or paired cultivation—require external assistance. For solitary practice, one enters samadhi and instructs an attendant to prepare a high-grade hand-bell, striking it near the ear as the sound fades, then striking again. Those in shallow samadhi awaken at once; those in deep samadhi may require three, five, or seven strikes, yet all awaken. If the body shifts position, scarcely two or three in ten will awaken. Upon waking, strange symptoms invariably arise. The same applies to paired practice. If one does not awaken, the attendant must direct their spirit to focus on the practitioner or even align their mouth and nose closely to induce awakening. Should confusion persist, in paired practice both perish; in solitary practice, one alone dies.

Our late master said: "Once, traveling past Dongting Lake, I passed a grass hut where the Venerable Jing resided, having long hosted open Buddhist assemblies. Before I entered, an elderly woman emerged in distress, followed by a child calling joyfully for Mother."]

The old woman was questioned in detail, and she replied, "Qing Gu has awakened!" She then turned back. Struck by this, I followed. Before I could ask, Qing Gu had already descended the steps, and upon seeing me, she exclaimed with great joy, "It is indeed you, it is indeed you!" She then led me inside. Qing Gu said, "To the east sat so-and-so, to the west sat so-and-so, to the north’s left sat so-and-so, and to the right was your disciple. When my spirit departed, I saw you standing solemnly by the hut, and so I awoke. I suspected it was a dream—could it truly be you?" She then recounted how the entire hall had entered samadhi while reciting the Buddha’s name, when this transformation occurred.

Upon hearing this, I carefully observed that no one in the hall bore signs of death. I then took the hand-bell and struck each in sequence. Those to the east and west all revived, but the one to Qing Gu’s left remained unresponsive after seven strikes. I then had Qing Gu sit to the right in samadhi and instructed her to gather and direct her spirit toward the still form. After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, that one too awoke. All prostrated themselves and kowtowed, saying, "We had just entered the land of mist, unable to distinguish east from west. Suddenly, the wind of the temple bell carried us, and our minds settled slightly—only then did we awaken."

To the left sat a monk, Qing Gu’s cousin from Tonglu and a disciple of the hut’s master, Venerable Jing, aged sixteen. The monk said, "I was blinded by the bewildering mist and mistakenly entered an ice cellar, my body stiff and unmoving. The bell’s sound hummed, but the mist grew thicker. Then, a warm qi suddenly penetrated my body and heart, reviving my spirit. I heard you calling me, and only then did I awaken as if from a dream."

I said, "This is entering samādhi. From now on, should this occur again, be careful not to shift your sleeping mats. Instead, use the chime to summon them—none will fail to awaken. When one among those in samādhi awakens first, take care not to descend from the seat. You must wait until all have awakened before descending.

This time, the entire hall entered samādhi—a rare opportunity through the ages. Yet alas, their faculties remained dull, unable to ascend to the clear void. Had they reached the harmony of spring, they might have beheld the stars and moon once more, seen jade-green waters a thousand fathoms deep, and lotus blossoms lining the banks—only to re-enter the primordial chaos and awaken. Then, they would not be far from the Dao!

Now, regrettably, Venerable Jing has also entered this state, and the hut has no master. Dare I adhere rigidly to the scriptures and neglect expedience? Yet, as the saying goes, 'Above, we are sheltered by the clouds of the immortals; the Buddhas and heavens will surely bestow their grace.' This is why I stood in vigil beside the hut. Qing Gu, take heed and encourage the others."

[The Master’s example was later recorded by Master Qiaoyun in *The Golden Canopy Diary*. This account may serve as a mirror for those who cultivate the true Way, and so it is appended here.]

Someone asked, "The Way of the Golden Elixir, once attained, is eternal. How then can there be the peril of death and revival?"

I answered, "The hour of midnight is the moment for receiving life. When true lead merges with mercury, and lead and mercury fuse, all pulses cease, and every thought is stilled. One enters the aperture of primordial chaos. If the slightest carelessness occurs, the Great Elixir will leak away. This is the critical juncture—life is received here, and life may also be lost here. Thus, the ancients said, 'In the chaos of seven days, death and revival occur; it all depends on companions to regulate the water and fire.'"

Another asked, "The signs of elixir formation lie within oneself. How can companions regulate the water and fire?"

I answered, "These are not external companions or water and fire, but internal ones—like-minded individuals who can harmonize yin and yang to augment one’s strength. As it is said, 'First, I am the host and they the guest; then, I become the guest and they the host. When we meet and our natures align, self and other merge, and lead and mercury unite.'

One water, one fire—within the crucible, they refine and boil. One dragon, one tiger—within the cave of creation, they devour and consume. Spirit congeals, qi gathers, and the infant takes form. Without the aid of companions, how could this be achieved? Yet such companions are most difficult to find.

Alas! If mortals seek the treasures of heaven, they must spend the wealth of the world. If one is stingy in conduct and miserly in giving, ten thousand immortals will refuse to come."

[Verification: According to the response, what is sought is an inner companion to harmonize the tiger and dragon, hence the phrase: "a person of like mind and shared intent." Yet this is not mere earth or water—it remains a convergence of qi, spirit, and virtue. What is obtained is a grain of celestial treasure, grain upon grain. Treasure yet not treasure, unlike the mere "stop-crying" trinket described by the Immortal Maiden—a yellow leaf, not true gold. Master Wuyuan, it seems, had not personally experienced this, and thus regarded the ancient sages' accounts of attaining emptiness and receiving celestial treasures as the formation of the infant. Later scholars must ponder this carefully.

If the companion is truly one who plants the seed, without loosening garments or undoing sashes, the dragon and tiger, both in pure qi and spirit, will penetrate emptiness together. Within the purity of emptiness, they devour and consume one another. Beneath them, I but expand the bounds of my vessel, awaiting in emptiness. The seed-dragon and seed-tiger, born of their spiritual union, will naturally descend into my valley. I need only double my stillness and emptiness, and they will merge with my mercury. Guard only against the arising of stray thoughts, and no other mishap will occur. Upon completion of the work, I will feel an immediate, profound peace within.

Should celestial fortune favor me, and at the moment of seed-union, the sacred Father and Mother of Heaven descend to unite in the void, there will surely appear a celestial treasure—like the sun and moon conjoined, suspended in emptiness. At that time, I must expand my vessel to its utmost, and my true yin, accumulated like the dark garden, fathomless and boundless. Then, with intent, I may ascend to meet it, and the celestial treasure will come as effortlessly as a needle drawn to a magnet, with no other disturbance.

If my vessel is not yet fully prepared and my true yin insufficient, I may only stealthily partake of its lingering radiance, my body warmed as if basking in sunlight. Should I overreach and presumptuously seek to ascend, there will be a conflagration like flames scorching Mount Kunlun, where jade and stone alike are consumed. Even with a companion of profound understanding, we would both be reduced to ashes.

The celestial treasure spoken of by the ancient sages is this very treasure. The "wealth of the world" refers to the vessel and true yin. For this celestial treasure burns hotter than a fireball, and without true yin to match it, my body would instantly be reduced to ashes—there is no remedy for this.

As for the treasure Master Wuyuan obtained, though it arises from the union of living dragon and tiger, and comes of its own accord, one must still examine oneself. If my cultivation of nature is incomplete and my cultivation of life insufficient, there will be extraordinary dangers. Only with a companion of profound understanding, silently aiding and protecting, can safety be ensured.

When the treasure returns to the Northern Sea, one must above all avoid the scorching fire of the Southern Sun—this fire is the fire of desire. At that time, extraordinary pleasures will arise. If I am not a virgin in purity, or even if I am, but my knowledge has awakened early, having heard of such things, and the world’s ways being as they are, true purity is no longer true. Once the body experiences such pleasure, it is difficult to avoid slipping into the sea of passion—this is the greatest danger, and one must guard against it strictly. The Master, too, has considered this, hence his earlier warning against carelessness.

At such a moment, the practitioner must swiftly gather body and mind into the realm of nothingness, and fix the emotions between the spine and the heart—this is what is meant by "following the back of Gen." Yet even then, there remains the risk of relapse. This is where an external guardian of profound understanding is needed, to remain vigilant within. All three must adhere to the practice, using the striking of a chime as the signal.

The ancient sages left a rule, recorded thus: Invoke the black killer of the bubbling spring, ascend to meet the mysterious life at the sea’s bottom. Reverse from the northern pole of the sea, rising from behind, passing through the back to the brain, gathering in the void. Then descend forward, and one will feel the fire descend from the face to the chest, where the wind of Xun stirs within. Suddenly, the great earth appears in its primordial chaos, and then heaven clears and earth settles. Only then may one silently guard the mysterious aperture, practicing the initial line of the Qian hexagram, with four inhalations and six exhalations, and stop—this is called "assisted regulation."

This is to perform the inner circulation within the companion’s body, ascending and then externally infusing my own. It must employ the ritual chime to achieve the four becoming one.

As for the deluded fabrications of the world regarding such sacred companions—those who are noble as emperors, wealthy as lords of all under heaven, whose virtue rivals the Four Companions and whose merit equals Yi and Zhou—without karmic affinity, one would never encounter them even once. The perfected ones, pitying this, devised the method of "deep plowing and planting the seed," employing the subtle art of "hooking the mysterious." This is not a love of the strange, but because such sacred companions are purely a matter of celestial affinity. Without it, attaining the Dao is difficult indeed!

How many of the ancient sages ever encountered such a one? Master Wuyuan revealed this but did not complete it, and what he completed was not detailed. Thus, I have supplemented it here.]

**Question:** The first precept for cultivators is to avoid stinginess with wealth. Yet it is said, "One must use the wealth of the world," and "If stingy, immortals will not come." In the end, should one use wealth or not?

**Answer:** Use it, yet do not use it. Wealth is what people cherish. Using wealth makes it easy to win the favor of others and to purchase the true treasures of heaven, placing both heaven and humanity within one’s grasp. Without wealth, to seek true treasures is to demand and force—heaven will not comply, nor will people submit. Even if one is only slightly stingy, how can immortals come? This is why the wealth of the world must be used.

Yet wealth easily corrupts virtue and harms one’s nature and life. If one clings to wealth, it will delude me, and I will be at its mercy in all things. Thus, virtue must come before wealth, with virtue as the root and wealth as the branch—this is why the wealth of the world is not to be used.

However, this "wealth of the world" includes both the "covering wealth" of the world and the "common wealth" of the world—these must be distinguished.

“Question: ‘Wealth suffices to win the favor of others, and wealth suffices to purchase the true treasures of heaven—does this not closely resemble the affairs of the inner alchemy furnace and fire?’

Answer: ‘The person here is one of the *Kun* direction, not a woman of the world. The treasure is a treasure of heaven, not gold or stone of the world. The person of the *Kun* direction is an immortal, undying one—namely, the immortals summoned by the wealth of the world. The jade of heaven contains within it a precious thing—this is the true treasure sought in the world. If one were to suspect this of women or gold and stone, it would be slander against the sagely Dao, the conduct of those newly born into the world.’

Question: ‘Does the use of the wealth of the world refer to *dharma-wealth*?’

Answer: ‘Wealth is wealth, dharma is dharma—they are two things, not one, and this is the teaching of the dual use of dharma and wealth. *Dharma* refers to the workings of cultivation, refinement, and forging. *Wealth* refers to the offerings of sincere prayer and supplication. With dharma but no wealth, it is empty and unreal, and the true treasures of others will not reveal themselves. With wealth but no dharma, the firing time will be amiss, and the vessels of one’s own household will be unfit. Dharma and wealth—neither can be lacking. Thus it is said: *dharma-wealth* means dharma contains wealth, and wealth contains dharma; this is not the gold, silver, or money of the world.’

Question: ‘If wealth is not gold or silver, why did *Baopuzi* hear the Dao for twenty years yet have no household savings and fail to gain power? *Shangyangzi* said: “The poor worry over lack of wealth; those with wealth worry over lack of companions.” Zhang Sanfeng said: “Golden blossoms bloom fresh and bright—without money, cultivation is difficult.” What do these mean?’

Answer: ‘The mechanism and secret here are not known without a teacher—one must not rashly guess.’”

The Way of cultivating the true has two paths: one pertains to *upper virtue*, the matter of preserving form through the Dao; the other pertains to *lower virtue*, the matter of prolonging life through techniques. Those of *upper virtue* are pure yang unbroken, preserving form through the Dao. Without relying on wealth, they practice effortless merit and may thereby complete their nature. When nature is complete, life is also complete. Those of *lower virtue* have already lost their primordial state, like the poor who lack wealth. They must borrow wealth from others, prolonging life through techniques and practicing the Way with effort, only then can they complete their life. When life is complete, they may begin to cultivate their nature.

*Baopuzi* heard the Dao for twenty years—this was hearing the matter of preserving form through the Dao. That he had no household savings and could not proceed was due to lacking the accumulation of *dharma-wealth*, unable to prolong life through techniques, not because he lacked gold or silver. If gold and silver were truly required, *Baopuzi*, being from a noble and official family, how could he have had no savings? Again, how could Ma Danyang, with the wealth of half a province, abandon his home to live in poverty in an iron pot? Why did Liu Haichan abandon his prime minister’s position to wander rivers and lakes? Why did the Number One Scholar Luo forsake riches and honor to embrace simplicity? The ancient sages and worthies all did likewise—would they abandon their own silver and money only to seek what is difficult for others to obtain? Clearly, there is another principle at work, not the worldly wealth of mortals.

[Verification: If wealth is thus, one may understand! With the wealth of half a province or the position of a minister, what could not be obtained? Even Qin Shi Huang and Han Wu Di—how could they not have possessed the cauldrons of five thousand and forty-eight, or the nine thousand and ninety thousand? As *The Rhapsody of the Palace of Epang* says: “Powdered faces and painted brows—there were those unseen for thirty-six years.” From this, one may awaken! If one desires to cultivate this Way yet the mysterious pass remains closed, the true origin unrecovered, the root and stem daily decline, the flowing pearls scatter in all directions—nothing will avail.]

To know that the mysterious pass is a single aperture—externally it enfolds the Three Powers, internally it fills the Four Great Elements, fundamentally without inside or outside, present in every place and yet nowhere. It is simply a single qi—how could there be opening or closing? It is only when external things obstruct and block themselves.

If one can place body and mind before the prior heavens, the Three Powers and I are originally one thing. Within this, the true origin is inherently without gain or loss. All that is lost is like the treasures of an inner vault moved to an outer one. I need only settle my inner vault, and every single thing returns as if on loan.

The so-called "upper virtue" and "lower virtue" are both spoken of in terms of the present. If one knows to awaken oneself and simply settles one’s inner vault, step by step without straying from the path of return—practicing the refinement of essence to return to qi, qi to return to spirit, spirit to return to emptiness, emptiness to return to the Dao, and attaining the Dao to return to spontaneity—then one’s inner vault becomes the supreme Dharma treasury. The three worlds and Three Powers return to a single grain of millet, and how can there be any division between upper and lower virtue? Where is there any distinction between completing nature and completing life?

This is the secret of return in the Supreme Heart-Mind Tradition. Master Wu悟元 never revealed it. I have therefore set it forth to complete it.

The Master’s use of "world" refers to this very body of ours; his "wealth" refers to the wealth of this body—namely, essence, qi, and spirit. What he calls "good" is the primordial; what he calls "ordinary" is the acquired. The primordial perfects the Dao, while the acquired corrupts it—this distinction cannot be left unmade. The Master revealed it but not fully, for fear of divine censure.

Yet I hold that the obscuration of the Great Dao stems ultimately from the failure of earlier sages to extend their intention universally. The world says of Ancestor Zhang Ziyang that his transmission fell to unworthy recipients three times, and three times he incurred heavenly punishment. I say the cause of those three punishments lay in his reclusion, which allowed licentious and heterodox teachings to cite his works as proof and alliance—so that what he bequeathed in writing became a grave source of misguidance for the world. Ancestor Chen Cuixu saw this clearly, hence his reproach of "failure to universalize." Master Zhang of Qiongguan, in his eulogy, likewise offered veiled criticism—reproaching his reclusion.

For truly, when heaven and earth delight in men who uphold the Dao, to compose writings that endure through the ages and ferry those with karmic affinity is as if mandated by heaven. Cuixu said: "I shall ferry all beings in the world." And again: "Would heaven not act as heaven should?" If this be so, then what is there to fear in revealing the profound mysteries of the Dao? Thus I have set forth this supplement here.

The questioner said: "If it is not of worldly wealth, then the notion of external protection is likewise absurd. Why then did Apricot Grove entrust the Dao to Daoguang, charging him, 'Hasten to a bustling metropolis and rely upon the wealthy and powerful'?"

The answer came: "Worldly wealth has truth and falsehood—how could external protection lack inner and outer aspects? The inner external protection is Metal Lord, by which the Dharma-body is perfected. The outer external protection is the worldly external protection, by which the illusory body is preserved. This body has not yet departed the mortal realm and remains subject to calamities. External protection is what safeguards my nature and life, aiding my attainment of the Dao. To dwell in bustling metropolises is to cultivate worldly methods. For this Dao readily invites slander. In such places, one blends with the俗 and harmonizes with its brilliance, so that none recognize you, allowing for secret cultivation and concealed refinement. Huineng concealed himself among hunters in Sihui. Daoguang returned to lay life to complete his great task—both share this intent."

[Verification: When Ancestor Xue concealed himself in bustling metropolises and relied upon the immensely wealthy and powerful, it was at Ancestor Shi’s behest. It was also said: “Those who undertook this had already been secretly transmitted *The Supreme Mind Transmission*. For bustling metropolises are the great treasuries of Elixir materials. The collections of the immensely wealthy and powerful are even more refined and accessible. Within them, the Ancestor expanded their barriers and penetrated their Mysterious Pass, welcoming the dawn and dusk—thus not only was the Dharma-body daily fortified, but celestial treasures must naturally bestow themselves.

Assuming a false name to blend with the俗 was but a temporary expedient. Ultimately, one dons the Daoist robe—how could this be merely following the fashion of venerating the Dao? Having inwardly engaged with the Mysterious, one should naturally wear the robe of the Dao, as in ‘speaking the words of Yao and wearing the garments of Yao.’

To say this was to avoid slander is still a worldly sentiment, seemingly not the Ancestor’s intent. To say it aligns with the Sixth Ancestor’s path is correct, yet their circumstances and conditions were not identical. The Sixth Ancestor’s Chan practice had already attained non-abiding and nothing-to-be-attained, so there was no need to definitively conceal himself in the sea of people. Moreover, amid the jealousy of those in monastic robes, dwelling among hunters sufficed as protection for the illusory body. His midnight transmission was without hindrance, and living among hunters was enough to safeguard the Dharma. The Dharma here refers to the Dharma-body; the illusory refers to the illusory form. Using the illusory to grasp the Mysterious is also a matter of great significance. With these two principles, his concealment was thus.

Ancestor Xue’s concealment in the sea of people was solely to obtain a single material—beyond this, there was no need for such measures. Our Master, the True Immortal of Mount Jizu, once spoke of this, and thus I append this account for joint verification.]

Someone asked, “Cultivating the Dao is a matter of radiant uprightness—why then does it readily invite slander?”

The master replied, “This Dao differs from the worldly way. The worldly way values fame, profit, affection, and love, while the Dao regards them as trifling. The worldly way takes cleverness and quick-wittedness as true, while the Dao recognizes them as false. The rich are not benevolent; the benevolent are not rich—these two stand in opposition. Thus the way of immortals is what the world does not delight in; if not deemed foolish, it is surely deemed perverse. The great practitioner, outwardly rounded yet inwardly square, blends with the world and harmonizes with its light—precisely for this reason!”

Another asked, “Those who cultivate the Dao originally seek to sever worldly ties and leave the dust, with all conditions stilled. Now, blending with the world and harmonizing with its light—does this not risk contamination by worldly dust?”

The master replied, “Emptiness, stillness, and non-action pertain to what follows after the Elixir is attained. If one practices non-action before obtaining the Elixir, how can the transformations of creation be seized? How can birth and death be transcended? Blending with the world and harmonizing with its light are precisely for seizing the transformations of creation and transcending birth and death! Though one remains in the worldly, one is in truth beyond it; though one dwells in the dust, one is in truth free of it. Only after the Great Elixir congeals does one attain emptiness and stillness without effort, and only then may one sever worldly ties and leave the dust. One then disengages from worldly affairs and undertakes nine years of wall-facing practice to achieve liberation.”

[Verification: It must be noted that the final statement in this answer was not yet thoroughly penetrated by the master in the *Heart Doctrine of the Most High*. Otherwise, had he fully revealed in the preceding answer the reasons for harmonizing with light and blending with the world, the profound subtleties of true cultivation would have been accessible. All practitioners in the world would no longer remain mired in conventional methods, and the necessity of wall-facing would dissolve—would this not be the great prajñā vessel? Alas, why did the master not fully penetrate this?

Though he bequeathed the great method of deep plowing and seed-sowing, he lacked the power to practice it and the circumstances to accomplish it. Consider our Ancestor Xue: after the primordial was shattered and the true lost, he could only provisionally conceal himself in bustling metropolises, opening the mysterious aperture to radiate light and gather the scattered primordial unity, refining and nurturing the sacred infant. Thereafter, relying on the devout and powerful households of great wealth, he reverently performed the rites to reach the celestial treasures of the Most High, forming our sacred infant and completing this great matter. Once this was done, the solitary was no longer alone, nor was the dual merely dual—what concern remained for the subsequent tasks of nurturing, nursing, transformation, and pulverization?

This secret was not disclosed, and the Great Dao remained obscure. Even if the embryo formed and emerged, without nine years of wall-facing, pulverization into the void was nearly impossible, for the Elixir thus formed contained falsity within the true. The flaw lay in seeking swift results without attaining the true faith in the realm of utter nothingness.

*The True Words of the Dao-Chant* describes this as leaving this arduous labor to the infant, taking the broad path yet straying into the narrow, bird-tracked byways. Though the work may be accomplished, one remains in the state of an ordinary being, and the nine years of nurturing are ultimately inferior to the sacred infant’s attainment.

In the *Heart Doctrine of the Most High*, the Great Elixir’s method of the Dao advances step by step, refining with each stage. This refining, step by step, is the study of destiny returning to spontaneity. Its efficacy lies in encompassing the mysterious state and forging the semblance of a millet-grain pearl—such was the method of the ancient sages.

Consider a field of one *mu*: though it yields but a *shi* of rice, the stalks amount to ten loads. After removing the husks and chaff, another *shi* remains. The practitioner must know that even slight coarseness in sifting renders the rice unfit for consumption. Such is the nature of the matter.]

Thus, the ancient sages in this Dao invariably began with refining the heart-mind, thereby enabling each step to return to the primordial, advancing until reaching the state of "emptiness beyond emptiness" and "stillness beyond stillness," where the primordial Heaven then manifests. In such emptiness and stillness, when cultivated to spontaneity, the Mysterious Pass opens. Once the Pass opens, one may draw from inexhaustible sources, and the celestial treasures are thereby attained. Through such perfect coalescence, one may gather to form shape or disperse to become qi, without needing the practice of "facing the wall."

Someone asked: "Does the nine-year practice of 'facing the wall' necessarily require nine years of seated meditation?"

The answer: "No. The term 'nine years' refers to the principle of the Nine Returns. 'Facing the wall' does not mean sitting motionless; rather, it signifies an undivided focus, a concentration of spirit, aiming to eliminate even the slightest impurity—like a towering cliff standing before one, where nothing is seen and all dharmas return to emptiness. This is the method of quietly nurturing the sacred infant’s embryonic transformation, not the side practice of seated meditation to still thoughts or 'facing the wall' to preserve spirit, nor does it equate nine years with nine revolutions."

[Verification: This practice, though seemingly stable after the completion of returning and coalescing, is in fact extraordinarily arduous, and few in antiquity did not abandon it midway. The *Heart Doctrine of the Most High* is far more sublime, as it thoroughly penetrates nature to thereby penetrate destiny. The supreme secret within the secret lies in thorough penetration and singular concentration, accumulating little by little—this aligns with the alchemical scriptures’ principle of "one grain upon another grain."

The late master, Tai Xu, said: "It is like deep plowing and sowing seeds, then harvesting and milling to exchange for silver—this is not yet refined. One must exchange white for yellow, yellow for pearls, and store them in the inner treasury. Through such transformation, the outer treasury becomes empty, and thus one avoids the calamity of maritime bandits. This is the sublime function of exchanging the coarse for the refined."

This is the supreme secret of returning from existence to non-existence, from the illusory to the real. Practicing thus day by day, month by month, year by year, truly accords with the principle of daily and monthly reckoning. Yet few can adhere to it, and those who accumulate without transformation end up storing both the refined and the coarse together, their treasuries overflowing. Externally, they suffer from maritime bandits; internally, their treasures rot. Silver turns into sparrows and clams, and coins transform into green flies.]

These all stem from a failure to comprehend the wondrous meaning of returning to the primordial Dao! The perfected ones of antiquity proceeded step by step toward emptiness, attaining the utmost spontaneity—thus aligning with the profound concealment of the sagacious merchant. Their comings and goings were at their own convenience, as if exchanging a million in wealth for something that could not even fill a fist. Therefore, they could gird their waists with a hundred thousand strings of cash and ride a crane to Yangzhou. They could cast off at will and transform at will, having already attained the state where even emptiness is pulverized. Why then labor for nine years facing a wall?

Someone asked: “Is this ‘infant’ the same as the infant of the infant and the maiden?”
The answer: “There is a distinction. The infant of the infant and the maiden is the yang within kan, the primordial qi concealed within the postnatal. The infant of the sacred embryo, however, is the primordial qi that emerges from emptiness and non-being to unite with true mercury, forming an image—this is what is called the yang spirit.”

Someone asked: “What is the difference in function between the yang spirit and the yin spirit?”
The answer: “The yin spirit is the postnatal spirit of consciousness, what the *Yinfu Jing* refers to as ‘spirit that is spirit.’ The yang spirit is the primordial spirit of the prenatal, what the *Yinfu Jing* calls ‘spirit that is not spirit.’ The spirit that is spirit follows the cycle of birth and death—it exists while alive and departs at death, serving as the root of karmic rebirth across ten thousand kalpas. The spirit that is not spirit reverses the course of creation, coalescing from the midst of nothingness. Unobstructed by birth and death, it sits transcendent and alone, the true seed of immortality and Buddhahood.

The great cultivator refines the primordial and transforms the postnatal, dissolving the karmic roots of rebirth across countless kalpas to reveal the indestructible vajra spirit of the primordial. They endure as long as heaven and earth, rivaling the sun and moon in radiance. As for the middle and lower vehicles, unaware of the primordial, they focus solely on their individual efforts, quietly guarding the spirit of consciousness. When a glimmer of wild wisdom arises, they mistake it for attainment. Little do they know that after the four great elements return to emptiness, the yin spirit, left without support, must seek another dwelling—this is what is meant by ‘the root of birth and death through endless kalpas, which the deluded call the original person.’”

[**Collation Note:** It must be carefully noted that the Buddhist vehicle does not regard the spirit of consciousness as the true mind. Later generations of Chan practitioners, misunderstanding the Buddha’s intent, took luminous awareness as the mind and cognition as the real—how could this align with Bodhidharma’s teaching of “mind is Buddha”? *The True Words of the Dao-Singing* focuses on refining the mind precisely because the mind *is* the Dao, yet it is occupied by the spirit of consciousness. Thus, one must apply effort to refine and extinguish this consciousness. Only when consciousness dies does the mind of the Dao appear. The mind of consciousness is the seed of rebirth; the mind of the Dao is the indestructible vajra spirit. The *Vajracchedikā*, *Surangama*, *Avataṃsaka*, and *Śūraṅgama* sutras—when have they ever taken consciousness as real?

To refine the mind while missing the point is the error of later Buddhist students. Yet these later students do not refine the mind at all; they merely follow and guard consciousness, thereby falling into delusion—a violation of the *Śūraṅgama*’s warning that “pure emotion leads to downfall.” To fall into following consciousness is far from what *The True Words of the Dao-Singing* means by refining the mind. When the text speaks of “refining” the mind, it means to extinguish consciousness so that the mind may live! If the mind is not occupied by consciousness, why would it need refining to become luminous?

Scholars must read with a discerning eye, and every point will align with the teaching. What Master Wuyuan describes as the learning of the middle and lower vehicles is the practice of following and guarding consciousness, not the practice of extinguishing or deadening consciousness. Upon close reflection, the distinction is inherently clear. If scholars read without discernment, they may mistakenly dismiss *The True Words of the Dao-Singing* as unworthy of following. Thus, I record these few words as a warning to later students.

For to follow and guard consciousness is the way of the middle and lower vehicles, while to extinguish and deaden consciousness is the path of the supreme vehicle. Though both pertain to the study of the mind, one leads to sagehood and the other to demonhood—scholars, take heed!]

Someone asked: “What is the origin of the primordial spirit and the spirit of consciousness?”
The answer: “The primordial spirit is the essence of the two fives, born within the primordial chaos of the great beginning. Neither form nor emptiness, without shape or image, it is the coalescence of the qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. When a person is first conceived, at the moment the father’s essence and mother’s blood unite in the darkness, a wisp of transformative, mist-like qi enters the womb. From formlessness, form arises; from imagelessness, images take shape. The five senses, hundred bones, four limbs, and five viscera emerge spontaneously, without deliberate design—even the parents know not how. Within the womb, the primordial spirit of numinous qi is already present, the primordial spirit concealed within. This is the origin of the primordial spirit.

The spirit of consciousness, however, is the postnatal yin spirit, which endures through ten thousand kalpas without decay, ceaselessly revolving in the cycle of rebirth. Only when the infant emerges from the womb does it enter the apertures, merging with the primordial spirit to become one. This is the origin of the spirit of consciousness.”

Someone asked: “Since the spirit of consciousness merges with the primordial spirit, refining the former is the same as refining the latter. Why then is refining the spirit of consciousness called cultivating one’s individual yin?”
The answer: “There is an explanation. At the beginning of life, the spirit of consciousness is originally united with the primordial spirit. But by the age of sixteen, when the body of pure yang is broken, they separate into two: the primordial qi disperses, the postnatal qi arises, and the spirit of consciousness takes control while the primordial spirit retreats into hiding. Over time, the spirit of consciousness reigns entirely, and the primordial spirit vanishes without a trace. Who then is it that does not die yet can live?

If one clings to the individual self in cultivation, one merely refines this spirit of consciousness. Even if one attains the ability to know past and future, when the house collapses, one must move elsewhere—ultimately falling into emptiness and annihilation!”

“Someone asked: ‘When the primordial qi disperses and the postnatal qi takes control, if one knows where the primordial resides, can it then be restored?’

The answer: ‘Though the primordial is obscured by the postnatal, it is not entirely merged with it. As the ancient immortals said: *“A single thread of yang qi, if not exhausted, does not die.”* Begin where this thread of undying qi remains—from nothingness guard being—and how could returning to the root and restoring the original be difficult?’

Someone asked: ‘The postnatal is a thing of form and image, so why is it called “nothingness”? The primordial is formless and imageless, so why is it called “being”?’

The answer: ‘The postnatal, with its form and image, is a turbid yin thing—possessing the false but not the true, hence called “nothingness.” The primordial, formless and imageless, is pure essence—possessing the true but not the false, hence called “being.” The elixir Way takes from Kan to fill Li, using being to fill nothingness.’

Someone asked: ‘The primordial is formless and imageless—how then can one take from Kan to fill Li?’

The answer: ‘Though qi has no form, its principle is fully present; the trouble lies only in people not knowing it! If one truly knows, one can shape the real into the empty, give form to the formless. Within heaven and earth, the yellow sprout grows and fills the cosmos; the golden flower blooms and unfolds. By methodically gathering and refining, gradually collecting and tempering—waiting only for the water to clear and the gold to emerge—one restores it in due time. What difficulty could there be?’”

For the act of "taking from Kan to fill Li" fundamentally embodies the true meaning of returning to the root and restoring the origin. Yet scholars, failing to inquire deeply, fixate instead on the word "take," thus seeking signs only in application. If one truly investigates the presence and absence within Kan and Li to verify the real and the false, a great gate opens for entry, and a broad path lies ahead. But when the essence is left unexamined while only methods are pursued, all subsequent inquiries remain confined to application—leaving the primordial visage ever obscure. With the primordial visage unclear, how can one probe into the mysterious pass? If the mysterious pass remains sealed, the great union and consummation within can never be attained. From where, then, does the origin return? To where does the true revert? "When the water clears, the gold emerges"—this indeed occurs in due time; yet the root of truth and falsehood remains obscure, and their faces unrecognizable. The obscurity of ancient and modern elixir methods stems from abandoning the root to chase the branch! I recall that the *Daoist Canon* contains the *Primordial Dao and Virtue Classic*, whose entirety clarifies the body of the Dao—yet none know to study and investigate it. This scripture’s meaning runs deep, and fortunately, Master Li of Xizhai provided annotations. I intended to further elucidate its essence, but how many would truly savor its depths? If one could grasp and ponder it, the sequence of before and after would become clear, and truth and falsehood would be discerned. I planned to employ it as the touchstone in the furnace of differentiation. Alas, my learning is shallow, my talent meager, and my years now waning; I shall have no chance to meet again the immortals who dwell in this world. When True Master Shen Taixu was still alive, I regrettably never encountered his writings. With doubts unresolved, difficulties unclarified, and a thirst to annotate and embody its teachings, I dare not presume to proceed.

Someone asked: “In the elixir Way, there are fire phases and cultivation practices—why then say it is not difficult?”
The answer: “It is not difficult in the moment of obtaining the medicine. What is difficult is the subtlety of the fire phases. As the *Awakening to Reality* states:
*Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,*
*Without knowing the fire phases, it is all in vain.*
*All depends on the power of cultivation;*
*A hair’s breadth of error, and no elixir forms.*
If the fire phases are precise and the effort meticulous, it is indeed not difficult.”

Someone asked: “If it is said that the medicine is obtained in a single moment, then fire phases and cultivation are useless—why then speak of their subtlety?”
The answer: “That ‘single moment’ refers to the effect of obtaining the medicine, while the ‘fire phases’ refer to the work of cultivation. Refining the elixir is easiest; refining the self is hardest. The sages condense years into months, months into days, days into hours. Within that single hour, they mobilize their spiritual power, gather the medicine and return it to the crucible, and form the three-hundred-day embryo in an instant—this is the easiest part. Yet if self-cultivation is neglected and fire phases are careless, the lead arrives but the mercury fails to greet it; Kan comes but Li does not receive. It arrives, yet I am unprepared—thus it is missed in plain sight, gained and then lost.”

The *Singing the Dao in Plain Words* serves as the compass of the alchemical scriptures precisely because it contains this essential teaching on refining the self. Study this text deeply, combine it with contemplative insight, and the Way of the Heavenly Immortals is complete.” Such was the testament left by my late master, the Venerable Tai Xu.

Someone asked: “How can one know when it arrives so that I may be prepared?”
The answer: “How can one be prepared without knowing? The Most High said:
*Vague and indistinct—within it there is something;
Obscure and dark—within it there is essence.
Its essence is most true, within it there is certainty.*

This ‘something’ is no ordinary thing—it is the medicinal substance.
This ‘essence’ is no impure essence—it is true essence.
This ‘true’ is no common truth—it is celestial truth.
This ‘certainty’ is no ordinary certainty—it is real certainty.
When this certainty arrives, the tiger roars and wind arises; the dragon chants and clouds gather.
The great cultivator, at this moment, drives the dragon to meet the tiger, and the tiger to join the dragon, gathering them in the Yellow Court’s earthen crucible to congeal and form the elixir.
This celestial mechanism—those who awaken to it find it near at hand; those who remain deluded are separated by a thousand miles.”

“[For reference: Now, this state of *huanghu* and *yaoming*—the arising of wind and gathering of clouds—all belong to the profound conditions within. Yet if the Mysterious Pass remains unopened, these profound conditions will not manifest; if the work of refining the self is incomplete, one will not awaken even when the aperture opens. If one does not first place body and mind before the prior-to-Heaven, one will not even know what refinement is.

To place body and mind before the prior-to-Heaven, begin with the Six Fasts. Once the Six Fasts are complete, proceed to fast the heart-mind. At this stage of fasting the heart-mind, the work naturally reaches its fruition. Without movement or stillness, without direction or location, one arrives at the true realm of natural profound conditions. The Pass is established and opened—like bright gauze draped across the void, every aperture remains open, yet all remains as still as before, and even the gauze dissolves. What lies before the eyes is already within this state, utterly without exit or entrance, where could there be inside or outside?

When the work reaches this point, myriad profound conditions unfold without concealment. I merely abide in ‘not having that which has’ and ‘not lacking that which lacks,’ simply turning inward, where the inner is as the outer. By concentrating solely on emptiness and stillness, this is precisely what is meant by ‘the function of the Mysterious Function’—within it, there is no possibility of error.]

Thus spoke my late master, the Venerable Tai Xu, in his profound discourse, which serves as a sufficient supplement to this answer, and so I have recorded it here.”

Someone asked, “Is the Yellow Court’s earthen cauldron the same as the Yellow Court acupoint within the body?”

The master replied, “This is the true earth that gathers the Five Phases and harmonizes the Four Images—formless and imageless—far beyond the corporeal Yellow Court within the body. In the Dao of the Elixir, the Yellow Court transcends being and non-being, unbound by any fixed location. From the perspective of gathering the medicine, it is called the Yellow Dame; from the perspective of refining the medicine, it is called the earthen cauldron; and from the perspective of congealing the embryo, it is called the Yellow Court. The Yellow Dame harmonizes yin and yang. The earthen cauldron smelts lead and mercury. The Yellow Court nurtures the Valley Spirit. If one mistakes the postnatal Yellow Court acupoint for the true one, how can it harmonize yin and yang, refine lead and mercury, or nourish the Valley Spirit? Lu Ziye said, ‘The true earth has no position; the true intention has no form.’ Does this not refer to the Yellow Court’s earthen cauldron?”

Someone asked, “If the earth has no position and the true intention has no form, does the congealed sacred embryo also have no position?”

The master replied, “‘No position’ refers to the moment of gathering the medicine. When the embryo is formed, yin and yang unite, and earth resides within. The Yellow Center penetrates principle, rightly positioned within the body, blending into a single qi. The Elixir Origin takes form—though without position, it truly has position. Yet this position is not the clinging to emptiness or attachment to form; it remains formless, distinguished only by movement and stillness.”

Someone asked, “Earth is fundamentally still, yet now you speak of its movement. Does this not verge on the artificial?”

The master replied, “This is not the ordinary movement and stillness of earth, but the movement and stillness of the primordial true earth. Movement pertains to yang and is the outer Yellow Dame; stillness pertains to yin and is the inner Yellow Dame. The outer Yellow Dame facilitates the harmony between the two families; the inner Yellow Dame transmits the momentary passage, thus having position and stillness. Movement gathers the medicine; stillness refines it. Without movement, how can the primordial qi be summoned? Without stillness, how can the primordial qi congeal into the embryo? This is the distinction between inner and outer, movement and stillness.”

Someone asked, “The earth’s function has inner and outer aspects. Does the function of the Four Images also have inner and outer aspects?”

The master replied, “The Four Images combined with earth become the Five Phases. The outer Five Phases gather the primordial to complete destiny; the inner Five Phases perfect the postnatal to fulfill nature. When both inner and outer are complete, this is the Dao of dual cultivation of nature and destiny.”

Someone asked, “Nature pertains to the inner, destiny to the outer—does this mean the body has no destiny?”

The master replied, “Heaven uses yin and yang and the Five Phases to transform and generate the myriad things. Qi forms the body, and principle is also inherent. Qi is destiny; principle is nature. Qi does not depart from principle, nor principle from qi—thus nature does not depart from destiny, nor destiny from nature. How can there be nature without destiny?”

Someone asked, “If the body already has destiny, then cultivating the body alone fulfills destiny. Why seek elsewhere?”

The master replied, “Destiny belongs to the primordial; nature to the postnatal. Since the primordial qi has scattered, destiny is deficient. If one clings to cultivating the self alone, what is cultivated is empty nature; if one clings to cultivating the body alone, what is cultivated is turbid matter. Even if one preserves the present qi without loss, how can one retrieve the already-lost qi and restore it? One must employ the other’s immortal method to summon and gather the lost measure of qi.”

Someone asked, “The primordial qi is formless and imageless. Once lost, it is gone. How can it be summoned back?”

The master replied, “The ancestral masters’ oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction hold the secret precisely here—the Dao transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas also lies here. That which is lost from whence it departed returns from whence it came. The primordial qi was lost when one yin came to mate; now it is summoned back at the very place where one yin came to mate. Thus, the medicine is present, requiring no external search—it can be obtained effortlessly. As the *Yijing* says, ‘Returning without going far to cultivate the body’ refers to this. However, to summon the primordial, nothing is more crucial than finding the right person. Without the right person, the primordial will not return. Ziye said:
*‘The medicine emerges from the southwest, the Kun position—*
*To seek the Kun position, how can one depart from the person?*
*Clearly I’ve explained it—you must remember—*
*Yet I fear when you meet, you may not recognize the truth.’*
Without the oral transmission of an enlightened master, how could one easily recognize this medicine and this person?”

[Verification: The primordial qi is the qi generated from the union of true yin and true yang of the primordial Taiji. In heaven, it is called "Qian’s origin"; on earth, "Kun’s origin"; in humans, "true origin" or "human origin." The qi of the Three Powers is called "origin," while the principle they receive is called "the One." The origin is life; the One is nature. Life is called "self"; nature is called "other." Originally one thing, one kind, one family, they are forcibly named differently due to their various embodied forms—hence terms like origin, the One, principle, qi, nature, life, other, self, yin, yang, dragon, tiger, and so on. In truth, they are but one Dao.

From this, later scholars cling to names and dispute forms, their minds and eyes bewildered by clashing views, while heterodox teachings spread. Even the wise cannot avoid confusion, the root of which lies in the "Law of Heaven" recording a clause on "reckless transmission bringing calamity." The ancient perfected ones, without exception, trusted antiquity, and thus their writings often concealed truths, inadvertently providing evidence for heterodox schools.

My master, Master Taixu, took pity on this and therefore set down the monastic precepts in writing, orally transmitting one principle: "Venerable Lü Jing once attended Master Qiu Changchun in the Alms-Bowl Hall at night. The Master explained: ‘Loss comes from man; return comes from man.’ He said, ‘These are the oral secrets passed down by my ancestor, Emperor Zhengyang, from his own lips. These two instances of the word *man* must not be confused. The first *man* refers to human affairs; the second *man* refers to human origin. It means that primordial qi, scattered among human affairs, cannot be recovered—only by seeking the origin in the Taiji can it be restored without fail. Know that the Three Origins in the world have no root beyond the Taiji. In heaven, it is called the Heavenly Origin; on earth, the Earthly Origin; in humans, the Human Origin. If the Human Origin is lost and not sought within oneself, how can it be restored? Thus it is said: *Loss comes from man; return comes from man.*

Moreover, there is a deceptive technique called ‘planting the seed’ by earlier sages. One must place one’s body and mind before the primordial, and not only will the origin return, but the One will follow. I then await it with emptiness and congeal it with stillness. This, too, is the subtle application of these two phrases.’"]

The Master of Discipline asked, “If so, why then is there also the teaching of the ‘Undying One of the Kun Direction’?”

The Patriarch replied, “The primordial resides in Kun, nurturing the myriad things; the Three Powers depend upon it, hence it is called the *Gate of Life*. This means the primordial dwells in Kun. As Kun occupies the southwest, it further possesses the virtue of nurturing and completing. Kun is also named the *Human Gate*, for humans are the foremost of the myriad things, thus called the *Human Gate*.

As for the term ‘undying’, while things undergo birth and extinction, the primordial knows no birth or extinction, and Kun likewise relies upon it for stability. The earlier sages, recognizing that it harbors the primordial of life, therefore named it the *Undying Direction*. Moreover, since things receive life through Kun’s dwelling, and humans are also things, it is called the *Undying One of the Kun Direction*. Here, the term ‘one’ does not refer to immortals or buddhas, but to the *Human Origin*—it must not be mistaken for an ordinary person.

If one understands and embodies this, welcoming it with emptiness and stillness, the primordial of prior heaven will unfailingly be restored. Once restored, the primordial naturally congeals—what need is there for a furnace? What need for a crucible? Furthermore, the furnace and crucible are metaphors of the ancient sages. The world, failing to comprehend, has spawned all manner of misguided interpretations.”

Such is the record in the *Pillow Secrets of the Vinaya School*.

The Master’s answer here reveals that nothing is more vital than obtaining the right person. He further states: “Qi is lost through union with a single yin; it must therefore be summoned and gathered at the very place where that union occurred.” This has become a favored proof-text for heterodox schools, so I record my teacher’s teachings to supplement what this answer leaves incomplete.

Moreover, is the loss of the *Human Origin* solely through union with yin? The Buddhist scriptures speak of loss “through emission by hand.” The *Compilation on Abstaining from Lust* describes loss “through external attachment to ‘dragon-sun.’” Medical texts record loss “through nocturnal emission.” Yet the claim is made that “one must seek restoration at the place of loss,” and that “the original substance lost is readily restored.” According to what I have set forth, neither the original place nor the original substance offers any possibility of recovery.

Following the teaching of my late master: “It comes from the Supreme Ultimate; it returns to the Supreme Ultimate.” Thus, if I seek restoration, I must welcome it from the Supreme Ultimate. This principle is perfectly correct and perfectly clear.

However, in the Master’s answer, the phrase “lost from where it was lost, seek it from where it was lost” must have been transmitted orally by later disciples of the Vinaya School, where the critical substitution of *what* (何) for *person* (人) carries great significance. Readers should examine this carefully.

Since the Master titled his work *Disputations and Challenges*, these two characters cannot remain unexamined—let readers weigh them judiciously.

In the autumn of the *renzi* year of the Qianlong reign, I sought the supreme Dao from the earth-dwelling immortal Huang Shouzhong. At the time, the immortal was over five hundred years old, having been born in the Song dynasty and entered China during the early Yuan. A Yuezhi native, he received the Three Great Precepts in the twelfth year of the Shunzhi reign from the eminent scholar Master Kunyang Wang. He said: “From where does one obtain human nature and life? From where does one seek what has been lost? Without mind-to-mind transmission, how can one return to the origin?”

Yet human nature and life possess both prior and posterior aspects.

The precelestial nature and life scatter and return to the Boundless. The postcelestial nature and life scatter and return to Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are but the postcelestial realm that follows the Boundless. The formless nature and life of the human body derive from the Boundless. The postcelestial nature and life of the human body take shape from father and mother—these are the Three Treasures of form. Thus, when lost and unguarded, they return to Heaven and Earth, which is what is meant by “the hun ascends to Heaven, the po descends to Earth.”

The perfected ones of antiquity, though their pre- and postcelestial aspects scattered and were lost, sought them all in stillness from the Boundless. This is because the qi of the Boundless encompasses both prior and posterior! The method of seeking in stillness is to empty and still my physical form, to immerse and still my Dharma-body. Thus, one summons without summoning, gathers without gathering, coalesces without coalescing—only following the natural course. For the qi of Nature fuses the Three Powers!

The Three Powers share a single qi, fundamentally without coming or going, without being or nonbeing, without movement or stillness, without birth or extinction. It cannot be named, yet by force of convention it is called the Supreme Ultimate. Though people say the Boundless gives rise to the Supreme Ultimate, in truth it is the Supreme Ultimate that gives rise to the bounded and the boundless! Hence it is called the Supreme Ultimate.

If so, the Boundless and the Supreme Ultimate bear a relationship like that of grandfather and grandson, concealing within them the wondrous function of overcoming to generate—this is precisely the alchemical work of return and reversal. Thus did my former preceptor explain it to me.

There is yet deeper plowing and planting, the inquiry into the mysterious through illusion, the great enactment of great function.

This is no mere oath sworn by sea or mountain—it may not be transmitted by word of mouth. Yet it is nothing other than accomplished through "silent seeking." The immortals who abide in the world, the patriarchs who uphold the precepts, and the profound discourses all proceed thus. However, this supreme Way of the Golden Elixir is preserved and practiced only within our Precept Tradition. Though the texts of external schools and sects fill libraries, none attain the mind-to-mind transmission of Precept Masters Shen and Huang—at best, they merely resemble it. Not that they have not heard of it, but rather, they dare not reveal it!

Someone asked: "Life and nature are my own life and nature; cultivation depends on oneself, and no other can take one’s place. Now you speak of ‘not departing from the person’—does this not mean seeking from another?"

I answer: "This person is no outsider, but the deathless one, the original true person. The ancient immortals said: ‘If you wish for a person not to die, you must seek the deathless person.’ This is called the Golden Duke. The Golden Duke was originally of my own household, but it wandered off and became lost in another’s home, deluded and unable to return. All that remains in my household is pure yin. If one clings to cultivating this solitary yin, how can it avail? Therefore, one must call back the Golden Duke to pair with my Wooden Mother, only then can the medicine be born and the elixir formed."

[Verification: As Master Wuyuan has clearly stated in his response.]

Yet without reflecting deeply upon these additional remarks, the principle remains difficult to fathom. When it speaks of the "deathless one," and again of the "original true person," and further states: "The Golden Duke was originally an object released from my own household, but it wandered into another’s home—only by calling back the Golden Duke can matters be resolved"—how perfectly clear this is! It refers to the primordial qi that has departed and returned to the Wuji. Thus, it must be called back. If one clings to the notion of self and other as the colored body, doubts will arise on all sides.

In savoring Master Wuyuan’s response, I find the phrase "to pair with my Wooden Mother" still lacking in precision. According to the oral transmission of his teacher Huang, when a person’s primordial essence is lost, it is not merely the Golden Duke that has strayed—Wooden Mother must also have departed in full. What remains in the body, the heart-mind that dwells within, are but the handmaids and concubines of the Golden Duke. The method lies in calling back the Golden Duke and welcoming home the Wooden Mother, thereby restoring the household’s prosperity—only then does it accord with the profound meaning. For when a single deluded thought arises, the spirit flees, the qi scatters, and essence inevitably leaks. There has never been a case where qi scatters and the spirit does not flee, or where essence does not leak. Thus, the primordial nature and life are no longer at home. What remains in the household is merely the acquired nature and life—hence the term "pure yin." Therefore, I say one must call back the Golden Duke and welcome home the Wooden Mother, so that metal and wood unite, and the Way of ceaseless generation is complete. If Wooden Mother does not return, the calamity of fan-flames will not cease, and the Golden Duke can never rest in peace. Master Wuyuan omitted this crucial point, seemingly a lacuna in his teaching, which I have thus supplemented.

---

Someone asked: "How is the Golden Duke called back?"
I answered: "Calling him back is exceedingly simple—the only difficulty lies in failing to recognize him. If one truly recognizes him, a single call brings him at once. Like an echo in an empty valley, there is none who does not come. The reason the Golden Duke departed is that I grew distant and neglected him. Now, knowing him as the savior of life, if one cherishes and loves him, he will return home at once, without the slightest effort."

[Verification: One must understand that the Golden Duke’s departure was due to the usurpation of power by treacherous ministers, the fan-flames stoked by favored concubines, and the full retreat of Wooden Mother, which brought the humiliation of dust upon the Golden Duke. The solution lies solely in expelling the treacherous ministers, welcoming home Wooden Mother, and purifying the governance of the palace—only then can the affairs of the court be restored, and the Golden Duke will surely grace us with his presence. That it requires no effort is the Way of dual cultivation of nature and life. In essence, the method is nothing more than quieting the heart-mind and settling the qi, attaining utmost emptiness and stillness, and proceeding to the point of natural spontaneity. Then, the governance of this palace and the court will be purified and solemn, the Golden Duke will arrive of his own accord, and Wooden Mother will return naturally. If even the slightest thought of recognition arises, there will surely be future calamities. Master Wuyuan’s answer did not touch upon this, for he missed the initial step of welcoming home Wooden Mother and instead fell into the realm of recognition, which does not fully align with the great Dao of the Golden Elixir. Thus, I have respectfully supplemented this to verify the insights of the enlightened.]

"Someone asked, 'Once the Golden Duke is summoned back, can one immediately receive the life force?'

The answer was, 'Not yet. The arrival of the Golden Duke means the true seed is in hand. From this point, one must apply genuine effort and cultivate it in due season. When the Yellow Sprout emerges, warm and nurture it until it ripens. Only by swallowing and ingesting it can one truly secure it.'"

[Verification: I once heard from the world-abiding immortal Zhang Pengtou—Zhang being his adopted surname, the son of the loyal minister of the former Ming, Qu Shisi—that during the Jiaqing era, he came to Jin Gai, appearing as a man of about thirty. I had long heard of his name! I inquired of him regarding the lineages of the Yin-Yang tradition, seeking to determine which school was the most authentic.

The immortal replied, 'Your master, the Venerable Tai Xu, should have already instructed you—why ask me?'

I knelt and explained, 'Indeed. My master said there are those who attain it from the Great Void, those who attain it in bustling cities, those who attain it in the elixir chamber, those who attain it at the altar, and even those who attain it upon the elixir throne. Yet none of these are heterodox paths.']

The immortal said, "Those who attain it from the Great Void take the Great Void as the Dharma-body and the Three Powers as the medicinal substances—this is the supreme vehicle of the highest order. Those who attain it in bustling cities take the Six Directions as the Dharma-body and the living tiger and living dragon as the qi-transformed materials for the medicinal substances.

"Those who attain it in the elixir chamber take the Dharma-body as the crucible and furnace, also using the dragon and tiger as seed and catalyst, thereby drawing forth the generative interaction of Yin and Yang within the Supreme Ultimate, gathering it with intention into the Yellow Court as the foundation of the elixir.

"Those who attain it at the altar take the elixir chamber as the crucible and furnace, and the Dharma-body as the Mysterious Orifice. They model the tiger and model the dragon, concentrating spirit in the elixir chamber, gathering it into the Mysterious Orifice to produce the True One. Some retain the One to pair with the Original, making it their seed; or they use the tiger and dragon as catalysts to draw in the Yin and Yang of the Supreme Ultimate, concentrating spirit in the elixir chamber, while the tiger and dragon also generate something. What is retained is the One generated by the interaction of the Supreme Ultimate with me, ensuring that nothing generated by the tiger and dragon remains. The One is returned to the dragon, the Original to the tiger, each silently returning to its place and resting—all these belong to the upper vehicle.

"Below this, there are still the middle and lower vehicles, which your master did not speak of. Follow my instruction and practice: empty your heart, still your spirit, forget your qi. If worldly wealth is abundant, what you attain will surely be rich. Should you wish to pursue this, cultivate virtue first, for great virtue brings great fortune. Heaven reveals this wondrous Dao to deliver one and thereby aid ten thousand. If your aspiration lies in long life alone, Heaven may not necessarily regard or protect you. Proceed according to your own capacity."

I bowed and received these teachings. On that day, a canopy of five-colored clouds lingered for a time before dispersing. The immortal master pointed and instructed, saying: "Young one, take heed. Today’s offering to the celestial spirits has already been perceived and acknowledged! Why not record this in writing to await the proper time for transmitting it to the world?" Now I set this down following my response, moved by gratitude for my master’s grace, daring not keep it for myself alone. I only wish that those of aspiration may wholeheartedly embody and practice these teachings—how fortunate, how deeply hoped for!

Someone asked: "In the Dao of connecting with destiny, is there a principle of inherent nature?"

I answered: "If one cannot cultivate inherent nature, how can one establish destiny? For inherent nature is the abode of destiny, and destiny is the dwelling of inherent nature. Nature and destiny were originally one family—how could one not cultivate inherent nature?"

Someone asked: "If nature and destiny are one family, then completing destiny should suffice to complete nature. Why then is there the saying that after cultivating destiny, one must still cultivate nature?"

I answered: "The nature cultivated while cultivating destiny is the nature endowed by Heaven. The nature cultivated after cultivating destiny is the nature of emptiness and nothingness. The nature endowed by Heaven arises from within yin and yang; the nature of emptiness and nothingness arises from within the Supreme Ultimate. They cannot be regarded in the same way."

Someone asked: "In cultivating the nature of emptiness and nothingness, is there a regimen of fire and timing?"

I answered: "The principle of cultivating nature is to preserve the form through the Dao and embrace the One in non-action. Though called non-action, it involves the work of guarding against danger and contemplating peril—it is not the doctrine of complete quiescence and annihilation. Thus one may return to the realm of true suchness and wondrous enlightenment."

[Verification: The principle of cultivating nature depends solely on sharpness or dullness; there is originally no regimen of fire and timing to speak of. If others advance by one, advance by a hundred; if others advance by ten, advance by a thousand. Without clarity and thorough understanding, there is truly no end to the principle.]

Great clarity and thorough enlightenment—how could one dare be the slightest bit negligent? Let us take the Buddhist sutras as evidence: Avalokiteśvara’s luminous illumination encompasses the great chiliocosm as if viewing the lines on one’s palm. The Buddha of the Śākya borderland’s radiance likewise illuminates three thousand great chiliocosms as if viewing the lines on one’s palm. The light of inherent nature may indeed be called supreme! Yet when compared to Vairocana Tathāgata, it is but a single petal of the thousand-petaled lotus throne—thus the Buddha of the borderland’s nature-light still lacks nine hundred and ninety-nine petals. From this, one may awaken to the truth that the nature knows no bounds—how then could there be any regimen of fire and timing to speak of?

---

Someone asked: “To return to the realm of true suchness and wondrous enlightenment—is this the ultimate end of the Dao?”

I answered: “Not yet. Only when one shatters the very emptiness of space is the matter truly settled. If one takes emptiness as the goal, emptiness still remains, and it cannot be called the ultimate end.”

[Verification: This so-called ultimate end refers to the principle of destiny, which is relatively near. But when speaking of the Dao, neither destiny nor nature has any limit. As the Buddhist sutras attest, the four great continents may be concealed within a grain of millet, and a mote of dust may contain them. Expounded further, the numbers of the world—countless as the sands of the Ganges, each grain itself containing countless billions of Ganges’ sands—are without end, just as the Dao is without end. Thus the dedicated cultivator’s practice knows no limit. To claim there is a limit is to admit that one’s accumulated virtue and merit are truly insufficient.]

---

Someone asked: “First cultivating destiny and then cultivating nature—this I have already heard. But there is also the teaching of first cultivating nature and then cultivating destiny. Why is this?”

I answered: “This refers to gradual cultivation following sudden awakening. For humans receive qi that may be pure or turbid, and the root of their nature may be sharp or dull. Those who receive pure qi and possess a sharp nature-root, upon encountering a master’s instruction, suddenly awaken to perfect comprehension and immediately recognize their original face before birth. Steady and secure, they henceforth never abandon the work of gradual cultivation, preserving that original face—this is what is meant by cultivating destiny through nature. As for those who receive turbid qi and possess a dull nature-root, even with a master’s instruction, they cannot immediately see through to the truth. Thus they must proceed from gradual to sudden, from effort to ease—this is what is meant by cultivating nature through destiny.”

---

Someone asked: “Is the Dao of cultivating destiny the work of gradual cultivation?”

I answered: “The primordial qi dissipates gradually. To restore it, one must likewise proceed gradually. As the *Awakening to Reality* states: ‘It all depends entirely on the power of cultivation; the slightest deviation will fail to produce the elixir.’ The ancient immortals also said: ‘Without shared language, they are not kin; without sufficient effort, the work will not be perfected.’ These all refer to the work of gradual cultivation.”

---

Someone asked: “The true fire has no fixed timing, and the great medicine is not measured by weight. If one receives the true instruction and practices single-mindedly, how could there be any deviation?”

I answered: “The true fire has no fixed timing—this means not rigidly adhering to the hours of midnight and noon. The great medicine is not measured by weight—this means that without sufficient effort, the work will not be perfected. Without fixed hours for midnight and noon, one advances or retreats as the moment requires, without any set schedule. Without sufficient effort, the work will not be perfected—one gathers and refines, nurturing qi and preserving spirit, without any weight or measure to constrain it. Yet the great Dao of the golden elixir is most subtle and minute, involving layers of auspiciousness, adversity, cessation, fulfillment, maturity, immaturity, urgency, and slowness—one cannot but be cautious.”

---

Someone asked: “May I hear the meaning of auspiciousness, adversity, cessation, fulfillment, maturity, immaturity, urgency, and slowness?”

I answered: “To restore the primordial is auspicious; to follow the acquired is adverse. When the medicine has ripened, it is time to cease the firing. When the medicine’s qi first arises, it is immature; when it has passed, it is overripe. To rush forward before obtaining the medicine is urgency; to proceed slowly after obtaining it is slowness. One who understands this may return the elixir, form the embryo, and wield reversal and compliance with perfect mastery.”

---

Someone asked: “The Dao of the primordial is the reverse Dao—why then speak of compliance?”

I answered: “It is to steal the qi of the primordial and return to yang. Compliance is to complete the work of the acquired and retreat from yin. Returning yang and penetrating yin, one follows the primordial without opposing heaven, and follows the acquired while respecting the seasons of heaven.”

---

Someone asked: “The primordial qi is also born of heaven and earth—why then does heaven not oppose me?”

I answered: “Though qi is born of heaven and earth, the perfected person can establish themselves prior to heaven and earth. Waiting for its arising and immediately gathering it, they cause heaven and earth to be unaware. Thus the *Book of Changes*, in the top line of the *Bo* hexagram, says: ‘The great fruit is not eaten.’ It preserves the one yang, halting its advance to serve as the foundation for return—this is what is meant by the study of the primordial.”

---

Someone asked: “The *Bo* hexagram strips away yang with yin—how can it return to yang from stripping?”

I answered: “The *Bo* hexagram is the transformative work of heaven and earth proceeding in compliance, preserving one yang without advancing. The sage’s transformative work proceeds in reversal, returning from *Bo* to *Fu*, turning the acquired back into the primordial, employing the six lines without being employed by them. It is simply to borrow yin to rescue yang! Its mechanism of stealing is such that none in the world can know or see it.”

---

Someone asked: “The Dao exists between heaven and earth, bright and upright—why then speak of stealing?”

I answered: “Heaven lends humans qi and destiny, but only as a temporary loan. If borrowed for too long, it must be reclaimed. Thus heaven and earth, taking advantage of human unawareness, secretly steal their qi—when it is exhausted, they die. The perfected person, deeply understanding the workings of creation, does not wait for qi to be exhausted but, taking advantage of heaven and earth’s unawareness, reverses the theft to steal the qi of heaven and earth, thereby prolonging life and enhancing longevity.”

“If one does not steal but takes openly, heaven and earth will become aware; even if one manages to reverse and control them, and by luck obtains something, what is gained is already false and no longer true. Thus it is said: what is seen cannot be used, and what is used cannot be seen. Only by acting before heaven does heaven and earth lie within my art, and nothing fails to serve my purpose.”

[Collateral Evidence: Though the Master’s answer is not original, it is not the orthodox teaching, still clinging to the worldly understanding of the word “stealing.” If one follows the *Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Exegesis of Characters*, the meaning is far more precise. “Stealing” signifies the arrangement of things within a vessel. “Arrangement” means storage, like a nation’s treasury or a household’s granary. In heaven, it is the Wuji; in the body, it is the established aperture. The perfected person conceals its name, hence calling it “stealing.” Interpreting the word “stealing” in this way seems more stable and fitting.

As for heaven and earth’s relation to human qi, qi has no sound or form, emerging naturally. When a person dies, qi returns; qi returns to its origin, and heaven and earth receive it—all occurs naturally. There is no intent to take or reclaim, so to say “heaven takes advantage of human unawareness to reclaim it” is flawed phrasing, still bound by the rhetorical habits of philosophical texts. Moreover, from the perspective of the Dao, the Three Powers are not merely one family but truly one qi, without exit or entry—what is there to take or give? To speak of gain or loss is merely human conjecture. The perfected person sees it thus: the Three Powers are one self, the Six Directions one mind; every thing and every being is stored within the Wuji. There is no gain or loss, no taking or abandoning, no coarse or refined, and no division between inner and outer treasuries.

Yet what is stored has its place, and what governs storage has its overseer. Taking and giving are the same: it is like taking gold from the treasury, a painting from the hall, a horse from the stable, clothes from the chest, tools from the shed, grain from the granary, food from the kitchen, or firewood from the yard. Each has its overseer; to take or give is merely a matter of intent, without need for commanding gestures.

If this is so, then returning to the prenatal is no difficulty. Herein one may grasp the meaning of “desiring benevolence, and benevolence arrives.” The pity is that scholars do not know how to fully realize their own minds! What is there to begrudge or hoard? What is there to take or reclaim? To say “heaven and earth are unaware” may pass, but to claim they “lie within one’s art” is a grave error. For the great Dao of returning to creation cannot be summed up with the word “stealth”—this is still the method of philosophical texts.

Moreover, the word “awareness” is a crucial principle in all practices of self-cultivation. When cultivation reaches completion, it is nothing more than perfect awareness. When one places oneself before the prenatal, silently awaiting the moment of qi’s emergence, it is precisely because the initial formation of qi is the Yellow Sprout and thus useful—not because one takes advantage of heaven and earth’s unawareness to carry out theft. When human desires stir and primordial qi scatters, creation gathers it into the Wuji—this is creation’s loving Dao, the meaning of fallen leaves returning to the root. When a person knows to return and seeks self-restoration, it is as ready and complete as eating when hungry or drinking when thirsty before one’s parents—no need to calculate taking.

Such is the principle. Once tainted by the methods of philosophical texts, the majestic teachings of the classics become mere cunning and deceit. A miss by a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles—how can one not be cautious in one’s phrasing?]

Question: "Since humans are born bearing the qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang and the Five Phases, we are but one thing among all in the cosmos. How then can we surpass heaven? And how can heaven be within the scope of our art?"

Answer: "The sage surpasses heaven precisely because he possesses the Dao that encompasses heaven and earth. To encompass heaven and earth is to operate in reverse beyond their bounds—thus, ‘my fate lies with me, not with heaven.’"

[Verification: This explanation indeed has its basis, yet the reason for ‘so surpassing’ remains insufficiently revealed; it is but a provisional account. The student must understand that the emergence of the Three Powers arises from the Supreme Ultimate. Heaven, earth, and humanity each receive the same Dao. Yet heaven and earth operate with mindlessness as their essence, while humanity employs mindfulness as its function. The reason creation lodges mindlessness in heaven and earth but mindfulness in humanity is that we dwell between them. Thus, all reversals of creation and all rises and falls of the world’s fortunes are ultimately brought to completion by heaven and earth. For these rises and falls follow the natural flow of qi-transformation. When the world waxes and wanes, when the course of destiny loses its Dao, the power to steer destiny lies with humanity, not with heaven and earth. If one can model oneself on the Dao, and the Dao models itself on spontaneity—if one can calmly embody the coming of qi’s mechanisms, supplementing what falls short and reducing what exceeds—then, whether the qi arrives as firm or yielding, strong or weak, warm or cool, dry or moist, stagnant or free, one always attains central harmony without bias or excess. Thus, life and death are properly ordered, advance and retreat are fitting. Applying this to ordering destiny, destiny prospers; applying it to refining the elixir, the elixir coalesces. In this way, one does not betray the office entrusted to humanity by the Dao. Heaven and earth rely on it for their positions, the myriad things rely on it for their nurturance. Because this principle exists, humanity too is called a Power and ranked alongside heaven and earth as one of the Three. When the student knows this principle, he embodies the Dao with every thought, allowing no private concerns to intrude—just like the ancient sages, neither belittling his person nor betraying his heart. With this mindfulness, creation entrusts him with governance and possession, not for his own sake but as something belonging to the Supreme Ultimate, now issued forth and stored within him. Hence the saying, ‘Humanity is the heart of heaven and earth.’ The rise and fall of the world’s fortunes are truly shaped by humanity; heaven and earth have no part in it. Since humanity bears this office, when even a single person remains unenlightened, it is as if he were flogged in the marketplace—this the Confucian tradition records. To ferry all beings across, the Buddhist and Daoist traditions take as their task. For this office and duty truly exist.

The Master’s answer pertains to the art of postcelestial adaptation—it is not the teaching of the classics and treatises, and this distinction must be made. Moreover, though humanity dwells within the Six Directions, tiny as a grain of millet in the vast ocean, by bearing this heart and receiving this office, the ancient sages undertook it without the slightest hesitation. They saw clearly that this heart is the primordial unity within the primordial qi of heaven and earth—vast without boundary, minute without interior. In the Dao it is called the Dao-heart, in Confucianism the Heaven-heart, in Buddhism the Buddha-heart. It is not the fleshy organ that produces blood. As for the ‘heaven’ in ‘humanity can conquer heaven,’ it refers to the postcelestial, not the precelestial. To speak of the Dao operating in reverse is not to reverse the Dao itself but to reverse its course and return to the origin. Note: This is the same ‘reverse’ as in the *Zuozhuan*’s ‘reverse marriage’—here, the term ‘art’ is applied to the Dao’s function. Lest later students be misled, this clarification is offered.]

"Someone asked, 'May I inquire about the Dao of human effort overcoming heaven?'

The master replied, 'The Dao is the primordial, formless qi of precelestial origin—the root from which heaven, earth, and all things arise. The sage’s work plants its foot in this formless void, and thus heaven does not oppose him. Observe the world: some suffer orphanhood, early death, or poverty. Yet if they perform a great virtue or establish a great deed, the orphaned gain descendants, the short-lived attain longevity, and the impoverished achieve wealth and honor. When virtue suffices to overcome heaven, how can the Dao’s triumph over heaven be surprising?'

[Verification: The answer is correct, yet it does not fully elucidate the principle of human effort overcoming heaven. Why not clearly reveal the sage’s work of standing in the void? This qi arises from the Supreme Ultimate, inherently without exit or entry, without coming or going. All responses arise from human resonance. Qi, having no intent of its own, merely follows the ebb and flow of resonance, which may be partial or dominant—qi bears no blame. The perfected person knows this and establishes their being in nothingness, examining the heart in emptiness. While the world’s hearts resonate unpredictably, heaven’s qi must manifest in the void. The perfected person, observing the first signs at their inception, discerns whether to nurture or suppress them, perceiving the pattern through tranquil scrutiny. Thus, they reverse the course at the first omen, either welcoming or obstructing it, with no effort expended. The world remains unaware, yet our Dao silently preserves wholeness. It is like a person in silent introspection, who becomes aware the moment a thought arises. At the first sign, they may choose to heed or ignore it, mastering their own response—why wait until the thought fully forms to resist it? The body is qi, and when a thought stirs, qi responds instantly, as swiftly as an echo. The speed of resonance between heaven and humanity is no different. To reverse the resonance is to overcome—what grand effort or great exertion is required? The master did not expound this, so I have supplemented it here.]"

"Someone asked, 'Does cultivating the Dao also involve accumulating virtue?'

The master replied, 'How could it not? The Dao cannot exist without virtue, just as yang cannot exist without yin. Virtue pertains to others; the Dao pertains to oneself. Those who study the Dao must first accumulate virtue, or spirits will despise them, inner demons will obscure their faculties, and they cannot penetrate deeply. Those who cultivate the Dao must first sow virtue, or heaven and earth will frown upon them, external demons will obstruct their path, and they cannot advance. Whether studying or cultivating the Dao, establishing virtue comes first—turning misfortune into fortune, encountering danger yet remaining secure, and surely attaining the Dao. For the Dao has limits, but virtue is boundless. Since ancient times, immortals and perfected beings, even after attaining the Dao, continue to accumulate merit and deeds in the world of dust, awaiting the fulfillment of three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds before receiving heaven’s decree. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states, *"Without cultivating practice and accumulating hidden virtue, demons will arise at every turn to obstruct."* How can one not cultivate virtue?'

[Verification: The answer is correct.]"

Those who can practice the *Three Nis’ Teachings on Healing the World* as expounded in *Master Lü’s Exegesis*, following its "Three Nis’ Healing the World" cultivation formulas, may heal the world in this very body—without spending a single coin or exerting the slightest effort—thereby attaining the verified state of "nurturing heaven and earth." Once a secret treasure of the Vinaya school, it has now been printed to preserve and benefit the world. Those devoted to the Great Dao may thus be free from the concerns warned of in the *Wuzhen Pian*, gaining profound benefits for both body and world. Yet the master did not mention this—perhaps he has not yet heard of it!

**Question:** "A true cultivator may be as poor as a beggar, relying entirely on alms for clothing and food. How can they have silver or coin to accumulate virtue?"

**Answer:** "Accumulating virtue does not necessarily require silver or coin. Virtue without wealth is even greater than virtue with wealth. For those who have left the household life, the two characters 'expedient means' are of utmost importance. Practices such as enduring hardship for the sake of others, speaking truthfully, never deceiving donors, dispensing medicine or offering tea, repairing bridges and mending roads, and guiding others toward goodness—whatever brings the slightest benefit to others, do it; whatever harms others, refrain from it. All these are ways of accumulating virtue and establishing conduct. Proceeding thus, one forges karmic ties with others, and heavenly blessings become attainable. Such actions not only benefit others but also oneself."

**[Verification: The answer is most apt.]**

"Those of superior virtue and those of lesser virtue alike must first uphold conduct. After three years of such practice, past karmic debts may be redeemed. Only then may one engage in healing the world, whereupon great merit may be attained."

Someone asked, "Does focusing solely on accumulating virtue hinder the work of cultivating the Dao?"

The answer came: "How could it hinder? Externally, one accumulates virtue; internally, one cultivates the Dao. Virtue aids the Dao, and the Dao perfects virtue. When Dao and virtue advance together, inner and outer realms are equally fulfilled—this is the solid, grounded endeavor of sages and worthies. It is not like the middle and lower vehicles, which cling to emptiness and non-action, mistaking mere mental fixation for the Dao."

[Verification: I humbly observe that the great Dao of healing the world is precisely the practice of healing the world through one’s own body—a truly grounded and profound learning of the sage, the supreme Dao, not mere magical power. Its efficacy is tangible and concrete: the body is at peace, and the world is governed. Yet one must first open the mysterious pass before proceeding. For what is undertaken here concerns nothing other than *xing* and *ming*, and its verification lies in the simultaneous attainment of virtue and merit—this is the highest vehicle of alchemical practice. Those who aspire to the great Dao may pursue this path. Its method involves regarding the head as heaven, the *jiangque* as the capital, and the abdomen as the marketplace. The essential secret is this: with intention, welcome the true *qi* of the Limitless, allowing it to descend into the abdomen and heart, penetrate the spine, and reach the back, with the aim of achieving a heart at peace and *qi* at rest, filling the entire body with harmony. Do not count the years; practice thrice daily, and the effects will manifest without need for inquiry. This teaching is the supreme Mahāyāna learning of the heart. Note: It is none other than the great Dao of the *Zhongyong*. When affairs are clear, one welcomes *qian*; when affairs are harmonious, one welcomes *kun*. By means of these two *qi*, one attains the center and harmony—this is the practical learning of integrating virtue into the Dao.]

Someone asked, "Confucians preserve the heart and nurture *xing*, Daoists cultivate the heart and refine *xing*, and Buddhists illuminate the heart and perceive *xing*—the sages of the Three Teachings all establish their teachings on heart and *xing*. Yet now you say, ‘The heart is not the Dao.’ This is truly perplexing."

The answer came: "The Dao is the Dao, and heart-*xing* is heart-*xing*—it is not that heart-*xing* is the Dao. When Confucians speak of preserving the heart and nurturing *xing*, it is to enact the Dao. When Daoists speak of cultivating the heart and refining *xing*, it is to avoid harming the Dao. When Buddhists speak of illuminating the heart and perceiving *xing*, it is to perfect the Dao. Thus, heart and *xing* are used to cultivate the Dao, but cultivating heart and *xing* is not itself the Dao. Moreover, to speak of preserving, cultivating, and illuminating is not to advocate emptiness and non-action! If one truly empties the heart and takes that as the Dao, then the heart would be the Dao. Cultivating the heart would grant longevity, and nurturing the heart would grant immortality—why then seek teachers, visit friends, or inquire after true secrets?"

Someone asked, "If the heart is not the Dao, might the Dao lie in the heart’s movement and stillness?"

The answer came: "The heart is the root of life and death, the very thing that harms the Dao. For one who cultivates the Dao, the first step is to cut off this thing at its root, so as to advance directly without obstruction. The sage said, ‘The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle.’ How greatly the heart harms people!"

[Verification: Note:]

The meaning of "only when the heart dies does the spirit live" refers to the discriminating heart. What follows below all pertains to the Dao-heart.

Someone asked, "Is the Dao-heart not a heart at all?"

The answer came: "The Dao-heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth. It is heart yet not heart—empty and vast, possessing every principle yet untouched by any thing. It is the spirit refined from the Five Agents’ essence, known by many names: True Yang, True Lead, True Seed, Black Tiger, Metal Duke, True Essence, Spirit Illumination, Gold in Water, Yang within Kan, The Other’s Elixir of Immortality, Ninth Third Noble Youth, Luminous Youth, and so on. In sum, it is called the Dao-heart. This heart has no form or appearance, no sound or scent, and is rarely encountered by people. Even if one should meet it, without true recognition, it slips away before one’s eyes. The sage, through methodical pursuit, gathers it from the void, forging the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood. In Confucianism, it is the Way of the *Doctrine of the Mean*; in Buddhism, the One Vehicle; in Daoism, the Way of the Golden Elixir. Later generations of monks and Daoists, unaware of the sage’s singular great Way, falsely claim that Buddhist and Daoist principles differ from Confucianism—how foolish they are!"

Someone asked, "If the Way of the Golden Elixir and the One Vehicle is the Way of the *Doctrine of the Mean*, why did Confucius rarely speak of *ming*?"

The answer came: "To say he rarely spoke is not to say he never spoke—only that he did not speak lightly. For the principles of *ming* are profound, containing the mechanism to seize creation and reverse life and death. To speak of them would startle and raise doubts. Yet the *Great Learning* and *Doctrine of the Mean* both concern the study of body, heart, nature, and *ming*, revealing great celestial secrets—only people fail to recognize them! Even the *Ten Commentaries on the Book of Changes* are nothing but the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining *ming*. Later generations, not understanding the great principle, contend over sects and slander one another. How would they know that the gate of Dao-meaning is the gate of all wonders, and also the gate of non-duality?"

Someone asked, "Since Confucius did speak of *ming*—"

"Why did he not also transmit the *fire-times*?"

He replied, "To elucidate the hexagrams and lines *is* to transmit the *fire-times*. The principles of fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation—these are the concrete practices of drawing out and adding, advancing and retreating. The great celestial mechanism is fully revealed therein; it is for people to comprehend it themselves!"

Someone asked, "Yan Hui stood at the head of the virtuous in the Sage’s school. Hearing one point, he understood ten; though he never opposed the Master’s Dao, he appeared foolish—yet this was sufficient to inspire the Master’s deep praise. Surely he had attained *ming*—why then did he die young?"

He answered, "Whether one attains *ming* or not is distinguished by principle, not by examining the illusory form. One who has not attained the Dao, though living, is as if dead. One who has attained the Dao, though dead, is as if living. For what dies is the illusory form, while the Dao does not die. Yan Hui grasped Confucius’ Dao, dwelling where others could not endure its excellence, yet finding joy within it. Having gained a single goodness, he bore it with dignity and never lost it—thus he had already obtained the primordial, true, unified *qi*, returning to the root and recovering *ming*, no longer bound by yin and yang. Having reached the state of the Sage, he no longer cherished this illusory form and could die at will. This is evident in the crisis at Kuang, when he said to Confucius, ‘With you here, Hui dares not die’—sufficient proof that life and death lie with oneself, not with Heaven. As for Confucius’ remark, ‘Alas, he died young,’ this was meant to encourage his many disciples by invoking Yan Hui. If he had truly died young, how could one who had attained the Dao die prematurely? And how could one who had learned to avoid early death teach others to die young? The meaning is clear—how could it be mistaken?"

"Someone asked, 'After attaining the Dao, one’s lifespan aligns with Heaven—why then did Yan Hui die at thirty-two?' The master replied, 'After attaining the Dao, one possesses a body beyond the physical—this is called the *true body*, or the *yang spirit*. The yang spirit is the indestructible true body of vajra. Once the Dao manifests and the yang spirit emerges, one looks back upon the illusory form as a heap of dung—what is there to cling to? The sages and worthies temporarily retain the illusory body only to cultivate the true body. Once the true body is established, the illusory form serves no purpose—why not discard it?'

Another asked, 'Confucius lived over seventy years before passing—does this mean he attained the Dao more slowly than Yan Hui?' The master replied, 'Confucius was driven by a desire to save the world, seeking to spread the Dao and awaken the people. When he obtained the *lin* beast during the western hunt, he realized the Dao could not be realized in his time. Yet, unwilling to let the great Dao vanish from the world, he edited the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, established the *Rites* and *Music*, expounded the *Zhouyi*, and composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—opening the ears of later generations and fulfilling his salvific vow. Once his heart’s work was complete, he departed this world. Yan Hui, having attained the Dao, already had Confucius preceding him in saving the world—there was no need for further effort, so he was free to transcend early.'

[Verification: Both Confucius and Yan Hui could freely master life and death, yet chose not to—this is evident in the classics. Did the master not see this? His words must serve a purpose. By strict principle: during the crisis at Kuang, Confucius trusted in Heaven, as did Yan Hui—thus they feared neither death nor life. As for Yan Hui’s early death, this was their submission to fate, not daring to defy Heaven’s decree. Hence Confucius mourned. If one claims Yan Hui dared not die while his master lived, would he have dared to die if his father lived? This affirms Yan Hui’s acceptance of fate, not the presence or absence of illusory methods. The three teachings’ core lies in *establishing ming*—precisely to align with fate. Thus, they remained unwavering in life or death, cultivating the self and awaiting destiny. The master must have understood this, yet his answer here serves a purpose. Earlier, he stated: 'The illusory has life and death, but the Dao has neither.' Later students may grasp this—yet those who study the Dao today do so with selfish motives. What more can I say? The world’s admiration lies entirely in the questions below, rooted in two great maladies: 'clinging to life' and 'craving the marvelous.' After the master’s next answer, I fear those who retreat in dismay will number far more than five thousand. Alas!]

Another asked, 'If the illusory body cannot attain the Dao, why do legends say the Yellow Emperor ascended to Heaven riding a dragon at Mount Dinghu, or that Master Xu lifted his entire household to fly away?' The master replied, 'Such events did occur, but not as commonly understood. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir involves *taking from Kan to fill Li*, *following Kun to return to Qian*. After attaining the Dao, all yin is exhausted, transforming into the pure *Qian* body—shattering the void to become a celestial immortal of the Great Luo Heaven. This is what is meant by 'riding the dragon to Heaven,' not that the fleshly body ascended on a dragon. As for the tale of 'lifting the household to fly away,' it refers to one disciple’s attainment elevating nine generations to Heaven. Alternatively, those of great merit and conduct may receive an imperial decree from the Jade Emperor, relocating their entire family to the celestial realm of bliss to enjoy heavenly emoluments, or moving them to a grotto-heaven or blessed land to escape worldly afflictions. The uninformed assume this means flying away as immortals. Yet immortals are forged through cultivation—without practice or realization, how could one become immortal? This clarifies the meaning of 'lifting the household to fly away.' Some fools even believe houses and earthly dwellings are physically transported. Consider: immortals dwell in the realm of emptiness—how could the void bear the weight of heavy, turbid structures like timber and earth? Moreover, immortals encompass Heaven and Earth—what could they not obtain, that they would still cherish these mundane materials? Alas! Even the illusory body is discarded—why cling to earth and wood? Why not reflect deeply?'"

"[For corroboration: I once inquired of this matter with the Great Void Elder. The Elder said: 'This Dao is absolutely true—refining the real from the illusory. First, one transforms the red into white; then, the white into qi; next, the qi into primordial qi. Further refinement returns it to emptiness, uniting with the Dao, naturally reverting to the primordial. Yet this is not a matter of one day doing this, the next that—it is a single hour’s work, accomplished through daily, monthly, and yearly practice. When the Dao is perfected and the moment of ascension arrives, the body is wholly composed of congealed primordial qi, and the garments and shoes one wears are likewise transformed by qi. Thus, one may stand in sunlight without casting a shadow.

I once encountered the Mud-Pill Elder three times to inquire of this. He replied: ‘Do you still doubt the truth of reversion?’ As I pondered, he took my kerchief in one hand and lifted my hat in the other, bidding me look down. I saw only the shadow of the kerchief—nothing beyond it. Startled, I then saw him place the hat upon my head while donning the kerchief himself. Again, I perceived only my kerchief’s shadow, while my head cast no shadow of the hat.

He smiled and said: ‘Now you understand! Yet the work must begin with solid, unadorned practice to return to emptiness. Even the slightest grain of sand untransformed leaves a subtle shadow!’"]

I then recounted the inquiry regarding the ascent of one’s dwelling, to which he replied: “There are two gates to this—one of method, one of the Dao. Method is illusory; the Dao is real. Examining past and present, over seventy instances of dwelling-ascent are recorded. Yet only the Yellow Emperor, Huan Xuan, and Tao Hongjing achieved it through the Dao. Others, such as Laozi, the Prince of Huainan, and Master Jingyang, employed methods to manifest the Dao, though in truth they merely relocated to remote islands to cultivate further, refining themselves toward emptiness. Whether they attained the Dao remains unknown. These are cases where the physical body ascended with the dwelling. As for the Yellow Emperor, Huan Li, and Tao Hongjing, theirs was a bodily ascension through the heavens, while the rest—over eight hundred in number—shed their mortal forms. Yet without the endorsement of the Three Officials and a jade edict summoning them, none could ascend by chance. Can such ascension be dismissed as mere illusion? Can immortality be equated with ordinary attainment?”

Thus my master recounted, and I here append it to corroborate the records in the immortal registers. My master further stated: “The sagely achievement of dwelling-ascent begins with the practice of ‘egg-guarding.’ The secret of egg-guarding: take heaven and earth as the Dharma-body, with the great qi spiraling, encompassing the earth below and the clouds above. From afar, draw it near, practicing without cease. Once the qi of the celestial stem converges, it forms a shield around the body, impervious to wind and storm—its efficacy is then manifest. Gradually, the gate opens, and serpents and beasts cannot enter—progress deepens. With unrelenting cultivation, awaiting the appointed time, relocation becomes effortless. Yet within three thousand years, only Wei Boyang, the Ancestral Master, and Xu Xuanping, the Master of Far Wandering, have succeeded. My teacher, Li Niwan, deemed the Dao not immediately essential to oneself, so I dared not pursue it.”

He also said: “The ascent of dwellings was undertaken by ancient sages only out of necessity, as seen with the Prince of Huainan and Master Jingyang. The Prince of Huainan’s three clans ascended through the power of the Eight Lords. Master Jingyang accumulated merit through alchemy, and his disciples followed. When they incurred heavenly censure and sought to mitigate it through method, he tested them by reducing singing girls to ashes. Of over eight hundred, only Yu Zhen, Yin Zhen, and eight others upheld the three precepts. Thus, the Long Isle was elevated, while seven hundred and ninety-one could not cross, leaving behind the *Prophecy of Dragon Sands*. The precepts must be observed; let past lessons serve as warning.”

My master’s words were not without purpose, and so I record them here.

Question: “If the illusory body is of no use, why do some practitioners, after death and during burial, leave their coffins empty, or plant bamboo staffs in their stead, or leave only clothing and shoes within? Does this not mean they have taken their illusory bodies with them?”

Answer: “This cannot be generalized. Some, after attaining the Dao, shed their illusory bodies while their Dharma-bodies manifest in a certain place. Having accumulated merit and perfected conduct over decades, their work complete and virtues fulfilled, they ascend to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, concealing the celestial mechanism—appearing to die yet departing in truth. The unenlightened, finding the coffin empty, mistake this for the transmutation of the physical body into immortality. Others, though their Dao remains unfulfilled, evade calamity by employing arts of illusion, substituting staffs or garments for their forms before vanishing without trace. This, too, is not the attainment of immortality through the physical body. As the Most High said: *‘My greatest affliction is that I have a body; if I had no body, what affliction would remain?’* Thus, to shed the illusory body is to relinquish attachment.”

Question: “Yet some remain in the world without discarding their illusory forms. Why is this?”

Answer: “This, too, cannot be uniformly explained. Some, having attained the Dao but lacking sufficient merit, retain their forms to continue their work. Others have completed their *ming* (destiny) but not their *xing* (nature), and so remain bound to the illusory body. If one has perfected both *xing* and *ming*, yet clings to the illusory form despite completed merit, refusing to relinquish it, this is called a ‘home-clinging ghost’—a state immortals do not delight in.”

[Verification: Note: The “home-clinging ghost” must be an obstinate immortal who fails to comprehend the study of *xing*. Not only is their *xing* unfulfilled, but their *ming* is not the *ming* of Heaven’s mandate, relying instead on the *shen* of consciousness to solidify the illusory body. To call this the completion of *xing* and *ming* is mere worldly discourse. If, however, one’s aspiration is to achieve the Supreme Vehicle—not clinging to form but refining it into an imperceptible, illusory semblance—this is the state of *‘complete reception, complete return.’* The ancients have attained this, and such cannot be dismissed as a ‘home-clinging ghost.’ This distinction must not be overlooked.]

Someone asked, “If one completes the cultivation of *ming* yet fails to complete that of *xing*, one remains burdened by the illusory body. Why not complete *xing* first and transcend it?”

The master replied, “It depends on what one originally received from one’s teacher. If one’s understanding was thorough from beginning to end—completing *ming* and then *xing*, shedding the illusory body to emerge as the Dharma-body—this follows naturally. But some grasp only the principles of *ming* without knowing those of *xing*. They may become ‘land-bound immortals,’ attaining longevity yet unable to cast off the illusory body. If they recognize there is still a higher path, seek a teacher, and inquire into the final step—moving from effortful practice to effortless attainment—they will no longer be ensnared by the illusory body. Then, a body exists beyond the body, form and spirit both perfected, and they merge with the Dao in truth.”

Someone asked, “The effortless Way is the work of those of supreme *virtue* who preserve their form in full. Why, then, do those of lesser *virtue* who prolong life also practice the effortless Way?”

The master replied, “Those of supreme *virtue* begin with no inherent deficiency; their spiritual chamber remains open. With the true oral transmission, one resolution brings a hundredfold clarity, and they cross directly to the other shore. Thus, in practicing the effortless Way, effortful work is already contained within it—*xing* is completed, and *ming* is preserved. Those of lesser *virtue*, however, suffer from a prior depletion of prenatal *qi*, and a hundred ailments arise. Even with a teacher’s transmission, they cannot achieve immediate purity. They must progress gradually, from striving to ease, and only after completing *ming* do they converge with those of supreme *virtue* on the same path, at last attaining effortlessness. This does not mean those of supreme *virtue* practice only effortless work, nor those of lesser *virtue* only effortful work. At the ultimate height of the Dao, neither effort nor effortlessness holds; heaven and earth dissolve into emptiness. Not only is effortful work unnecessary—even effortlessness is no longer needed. The terms ‘effortful’ and ‘effortless’ refer only to the starting point of cultivation. Not only do those of supreme and lesser *virtue* differ in their approach, but men and women also begin differently in their practice.”

Someone asked, “How do men and women differ in their starting points?”

The master replied, “For men, the essential step is refining *qi*. For women, it is refining form. Refining *qi* means subduing it, ensuring it returns. When *qi* returns, emptiness deepens and stillness solidifies, root is restored and *ming* recovered, and the White Tiger descends. Refining form means concealing it, aiming for its dissolution. When form dissolves, the Four Great Elements enter emptiness, the limbs decay, and the Red Channel is severed. When the White Tiger descends in men, they revert to a youthful body, postnatal essence no longer leaks, and they can form the elixir and prolong life. When the Red Channel is severed in women, they transform into a male body, impure yin blood no longer descends, and they can escape death and enter life. Thus, men’s cultivation is called ‘Greater Yang refines *qi*,’ while women’s cultivation is called ‘Greater Yin refines form.’”

Someone asked, “Do women refining form not subdue *qi*?”

The master replied, “Women are yin by nature, so their *qi* is easily subdued. But the Red Channel poses the greatest obstacle to the Dao, and this is where they must focus their efforts. Once the Red Channel is severed, *qi* naturally becomes docile—not like men, who are yang by nature and whose *qi* is difficult to subdue. For example, while it may take a man three years to subdue *qi*, a woman can achieve it in one. If a woman possesses the resolve of a true hero and receives her teacher’s oral transmission, practicing the Greater Yin method of refining form, she can attain the Dao in three to five years—her path is even more efficient than a man’s. Yet such heroic women are exceedingly rare. They must surpass men in fortitude a hundredfold to succeed. Those equal to men in strength will never achieve it.”

“Someone asked, ‘The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women—why then are there differences between them?’

“The master answered, ‘The Dao is the same, but its application differs. For their natures are not alike, and their physical forms are distinct. Thus, though the Dao of life and destiny remains one, its practice and effects vary greatly.’

“Someone asked, ‘How is the Red Channel severed?’

“The master answered, ‘The Red Channel arises from the body’s postnatal yin *qi*. When yin *qi* stirs, impure blood flows. To transform the blood, first refine the *qi*. Once *qi* is refined, the blood returns upward, entering the breasts, where red turns to white. Circulating throughout the body, it banishes the affliction of raging desire-fire. When desire-fire is extinguished, true fire emerges. From then on, all proceeds steadily and smoothly—preserving life and perfecting form is no longer difficult.’

“Someone asked, ‘When the golden elixir is accomplished and swallowed, does a woman transform into a man, and the old become youthful?’

“The master answered, ‘This speaks of principle, not of physical form. After a woman attains the Dao, she sheds all yin and becomes a body of pure yang—no different from a man who has attained the Dao. Thus it is said: a woman transforms into a man. After an elder attains the Dao, they return to the primordial and become a body of pure yang—no different from a child’s perfection. Thus it is said: the old become youthful. This does not mean their appearance changes.’”

Someone asked, “If the Dao has no concern with illusory appearances, why then are those with incomplete six senses not taught the Dao?”

The master answered, “Those with incomplete six senses are called the disabled and infirm—useless people. The Dao is what heaven and earth treasure, what steals yin and yang and seizes the workings of creation—this is the work of great sages. How could the disabled and infirm accomplish such earth-shaking deeds? They cannot do so not because they do not wish to, but because their form is limited and their qi obstructed. If the great Dao were entrusted to them, it would be like placing a precious treasure in a worthless place, and heaven’s punishment would surely follow. Thus, we dare not teach it. If one with incomplete six senses truly performs great deeds and cultivates great conduct, we may point them toward the lesser vehicle of nature and principle, guiding them to refine their path of coming and going. As for the great Dao of the golden elixir, we dare not teach it at all. This secret is known only to those who have heard the great Dao!”

Someone asked, “Are there not those with complete six senses who still do not grasp the principles of destiny, achieving only the cultivation of nature? Do they truly not know of the principles of destiny?”

The master answered, “The principles of destiny refer to the Dao of the nine returns, seven reversions, and the great return of golden liquid elixir—a transmission that occurs but once in ten thousand kalpas. If one is not a true man of resolve, bearing the unyielding will of vajra and the disposition of sages and worthies, they cannot attain it. Even a true teacher dare not transmit it. If they forcefully attempt to do so, spirits and gods will obstruct them in secret. This is because such a person is not a vessel capable of bearing the Dao. To transmit it to the unworthy is to leak the celestial mechanism. As for the Dao of guarding the center and embracing the One in the cultivation of nature and principle, even those of middling or lesser capacity, or those of virtuous conduct, may be guided to preserve their form. This is because the cultivation of nature and principle is an innate celestial mechanism, without the need to steal the workings of creation—it is not of great consequence. Nevertheless, it must not be recklessly transmitted to the unworthy. Generally, among learners, those of superior wisdom are few, while those of middling or lesser capacity are many. Thus, the patriarchs teach the cultivation of nature and principle to those of middling capacity and the principles of destiny to those of superior wisdom—establishing teachings according to the person. There are also teachers who transmit only the cultivation of nature, unaware of the principles of destiny, and learners who grasp only the cultivation of nature and principle, unaware of the principles of destiny. These cannot be discussed as one and the same.”

Someone asked, “If the great Dao of the golden elixir is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, will it not vanish from the world?”

The master answered, “The phrase ‘once in ten thousand kalpas’ expresses its utmost reverence and preciousness, not that it is lightly transmitted. Thus, after one attains the Dao, if they do not find a suitable person, they may remain in the world for hundreds of years, waiting until they find the right one before departing. For example, Zhēnyáng transmitted to Chúnyáng, and Chúnyáng to Hǎichán and Chóngyáng—each waited hundreds of years before finding the right person. The ancients were so cautious that the prohibition against reckless transmission is self-evident. When Zǐyáng transmitted to the unworthy three times, he suffered heavenly punishment three times—this is further proof that reckless transmission must not occur.”

[Verification: After the two patriarchs, Zhōng and Lǚ, completed both nature and destiny, they remained in the world because they had not found a successor. Our tradition understands the reason for their lingering presence. The Chan school, unaware of this, mocks them as “corpse-clinging ghosts.” Thus, the actions of the noble are often misunderstood by the common. This may be appended to the discourse on lingering form for further reflection.]

Someone asked, “If the great Dao of the golden elixir is only entrusted to those of superior wisdom, must those of middling or lesser capacity forever be unable to attain it?”

The master answered, “There are those who attain it—it depends entirely on how one studies! If one treads firmly on the ground, treats it as the great matter of life, ascends from the humble to the lofty, progresses from the shallow to the profound, and persists with ever-increasing effort until bitterness turns to sweetness, a true person will surely rejoice in guiding them. But if one is inherently shallow in roots and conduct, lacking great resolve, how could they ever hear of the great Dao of the golden elixir?”

Someone asked, “Is there a method to studying the Dao?”

The master answered, “Success or failure in cultivation depends entirely on whether one’s learning ascends to the heights or remains low. Where one does not reach, one remains deluded; what one does not know, one finds difficult. Though one relies on a wise teacher for transmission, one must also awaken through personal insight. Before hearing the Dao, one must conduct oneself as one devoted to nature and destiny. One devoted to nature and destiny is unburdened by wine, lust, wealth, or temper; greed, anger, delusion, and attachment are all cast aside. Apart from the Dao, they have no other concerns. With sincere heart and true intent, they draw near to those of the Dao, revering them as they would heaven, earth, and the gods, without the slightest deceit. They further cultivate bitter resolve and establish virtue, striving to accumulate merit. They do not cease until they attain understanding, and even if they spend their entire life without attaining it, they do not regret it. With such a mindset, sages and worthies will secretly guide them, and true teachers will gladly instruct them.

Nowadays, people do not study the Dao with sincerity. Even the intelligent refuse to humble themselves; if they do humble themselves, after a few days, they demand the Dao. At the slightest dissatisfaction, they assume they lack affinity and promptly depart. Throughout their lives, they do not accumulate virtue or establish conduct, but instead fixate on clothing and food, entangle themselves in worldly affairs, vie for superiority, indulge in greed, anger, delusion, and attachment—nothing is lacking. If they chance upon some minor side practice, they treasure it as if it were the greatest jewel, becoming self-satisfied and complacent. Even if a superior person stands before them, they pride themselves on their own attainment and refuse to seek correction. With such deceit in their hearts, how could they ever attain the true Dao?

A true person, when they first emerge, is already different from others. They possess both resolve and the ability to learn, are both honest and wise, and refuse to waste time or squander their future. After the Dao illuminates their heart and they see their nature, they know there is still more to be done. They must seek out enlightened teachers, and ultimately receive the transmission of the Apricot Grove, thereby completing the great Dao. Lǚ Dòngbīn failed three times in refining the elixir, but after obtaining Master Cuī’s *Mirror for Absorbing the Medicine*, his great elixir was finally accomplished.”

Those two masters both maintained empty minds and thus reaped the benefits of receptivity. Later learners, however, are arrogant in heart and overbearing in qi, claiming sagely wisdom and self-sufficiency. Unwilling to work earnestly for their nature and life, they indulge in empty posturing, yet still vainly aspire to immortality. This is not seeking fortune but inviting misfortune—how foolish indeed!

**[Reference Note: Here follows the account of how Lǚ Dòngbīn, through Master Cuī’s *Mirror for Absorbing the Medicine*, finally accomplished the returning elixir. Profound indeed! Profound! Such matters may be spoken of to those who understand, but are difficult to convey to the vulgar. If one merely treats this as a public case and reads the text repeatedly without grasping its essence, they will scarcely avoid plunging into water or fire, courting self-destruction. Even if one grasps the essence but lacks an empty mind—remaining arrogant and self-sufficient—they will still miss the opportunity before them, returning empty-handed from a mountain of treasure. The fault lies in their unwillingness to work earnestly for their nature and life, instead indulging in empty posturing.

This "empty posturing" refers to the "head" within the boundless body of my Dao—one of the Three Powers and the Eight Lords. Suspended at the summit of Mount Sumeru, what lies beneath this head is known to be taken as medicine, placed behind the mirror, and refined before it. Thus, one neither errs by attachment nor falls into emptiness. Swallowing it, one ingests it—this is called attainment, this is called completion. This is the public case of how Lǚ Dòngbīn, by refining Master Cuī’s *Mirror for Absorbing the Medicine*, finally accomplished the elixir.

I recall my teacher, the Venerable Tàixū, once expounded this profound meaning, yet he also spoke of a deeper mystery: when the mysterious pass opens wide, worldly wealth is exhausted. If one obtains this treasure without proper preparation, one may still face the peril of plunging into water or fire.

Thus, I append this answer to corroborate the earlier response of Wùyuán, for it was not without oral transmission. The later answer, however, was perhaps too profound to be openly revealed.]

Someone asked: “If Lǚ Dòngbīn failed three times in refining the returning elixir, was it because what he obtained was not genuine?”

The answer: “Lǚ Dòngbīn’s Dao came from the Perfected Lord of True Yang—utterly true, a thousand times true. How could it not be genuine enough to return? The issue was that after returning, he still lost it! In the practice of the golden elixir, one must know the maturity of the medicine when gathering it, know moderation when refining it, know auspicious and inauspicious signs when congealing the elixir, know addition and subtraction when nurturing it, and know the proper timing when releasing it. Moreover, there is the authenticity of the medicine, the measure of the dosage, and the sequence of its application—whether forward or reverse. There are countless intricate details, where the slightest deviation leads to a vast error. Lǚ Dòngbīn’s three failures in refining the returning elixir must have been due to subtle miscalculations in the firing times, some oversight in the finer points, causing him to miss the opportunity before him, obtaining it only to lose it again.

Thus, those who study the Dao must thoroughly understand the beginning and the end, penetrate the subtle and master the wondrous, harbor no doubts whatsoever, and only then may they proceed. Only then will they not err when tending the furnace.”

“[Verification: Now, considering the above: Lü Zu, being a sage, must have penetrated the subtle and mastered the wondrous—how could he have erred in the firing times’ subtleties? His oversight must have been in the earlier transmission of the method, specifically the lack of Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*. Within this mirror, the primordial qi fails to coalesce at the center, and the postnatal does not thereby transform. This is also called merely toying with emptiness. Without true yin to aid it, true water and true fire do not meet, the substance does not transmute—how then could it gather and be preserved for oneself? Lü Zu’s failure stemmed from this.

Having obtained the text, one grasps its meaning from its title and employs it in refinement, thereby achieving coagulation. Lü Zu, who began with purity and stillness, naturally attained Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*. Using it to toy with emptiness, emptiness itself wholly returns, yet the principle of purity and stillness remains unlost—profound, is it not? Profound indeed!

The marvel of the text’s title is thus: Wu Yuanzi understood this but dared not expound it to disciples. Here, he merely answers and hints with the four characters ‘harbor no doubts whatsoever,’ speaking thus to those of like mind among his disciples. The careless disclosure of the Great Dao is like this.]”

“Someone asked, ‘If one thoroughly penetrates the beginning and end and sets to cultivation, can one then attain the Dao?’

The master replied, ‘A master craftsman teaches others the compass and square but cannot impart skill. What a teacher transmits is no more than pointing out the true medicine and true fire, the great pass and great aperture. As for the subtlety of their application, the urgency or slowness of their practice, and the swiftness or delay of their fruition—these depend on the student’s strength, the keenness or dullness of their resolve, and the sharpness or bluntness of their nature-root. Thus, the methods of practicing the Great Dao comprise three approaches—upper, middle, and lower—each to be followed according to one’s capacity.’

Someone asked, ‘What are these three methods?’

The master replied, ‘The upper method is the method of spontaneity. The middle method is the method of expedience. The lower method is the method of grinding and polishing.

The method of spontaneity is sudden awakening and perfect penetration, where one resolution settles all; bare and pure, naked and free, perfectly rounded, radiantly luminous—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one never departs from this. Like a bright mirror or still water, nothing is not reflected, and nothing can deceive it. One moves with ease along the central Way, practicing it naturally—this is the union of heaven and humanity.

The method of expedience is returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, proceeding along the Dao while practicing counter to it. One transforms the false with the true and borrows the false to perfect the true. Adapting to circumstances and responding to conditions, one acts expediently, with inner and outer mutually relying upon each other.’”

The method of grinding and polishing is for those of dull nature and limited insight. They must apply effort to the ground of the heart, wholly abandoning worldly affairs. They harden their resolve, weary their sinews and bones, starve their bodies, enduring a thousand trials and a hundred refinements. They cling firmly to what is good, suffering what others cannot suffer, enduring what others cannot endure. What others achieve once, they achieve a hundred times; what others achieve ten times, they achieve a thousand. Through every hardship and affliction, they forge ahead with relentless effort, until suddenly their original face is revealed. From there, they proceed with steadfast and solid practice, converging with the upper and middle methods on the same track. This is the path of strenuous effort, seeking the Way through one’s own exertions.

These three methods are all secret teachings passed down orally by the immortals and perfected ones of old, instructing people to act according to their capacity. Those who cannot practice the upper method may practice the middle; those who cannot practice the middle may practice the lower. All ultimately aim at the completion of nature and life. Beyond these three, there are no other methods.

[Verification: It is said that even if the Most High were to return, these words could not be altered. Yet all begin with the practice of refining the heart, within which the preservation of life is contained. Through this single answer, the master’s merit is truly great! In the study of nature, if one’s practice of life reaches this level, it must be of the middle or upper grade. From here, one may advance to study Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Elixir*—one who refines thus will surely succeed, let alone those of the middle or upper capacity. As for us, we can only follow the lower method. Alas! Scholars must recognize that even one of Qiu’s caliber began with the lower method—how much more so for those whose capacity falls far short of Qiu’s?

I heard this from my late teacher, Master Taixu. He said: “Master Qiu was the Great One Descended to the Mortal Realm, yet he endured seventy-two great trials and countless small ones—freezing to death, starving to death, even being trampled to death, none of which were counted among the lesser trials. He accepted them all with equanimity and was ultimately selected by the Golden Gate as an immortal, ascending to the rank of Celestial Minister, becoming the teacher of ten thousand generations. The Fifth Patriarch was enfeoffed as an Imperial Lord, and even Master Liu was granted an imperial title. Who are we, that we should dare find the lower method too arduous?”]

My late teacher further recounted: “When Master Qiu’s Dao was perfected and he was summoned to the Celestial Gate, he was so overcome with grief that he could not rise. Master Lü memorialized: ‘Qiu, though descended as the Great One, endured such trials—how much more so for mortals of shallow capacity, who cannot withstand such refinement? If none can endure, the transmission of the Dao will be broken.’ This moved the Jade Emperor to console him: ‘Should mortals possess even a third of your resolve, their attainment will equal yours. The celestial immortals of the upper realms, though unanticipated, will bow in reverence as if their crowns were shattered.’ Master Qiu then expressed his gratitude and withdrew.”

This episode is recorded in the Daoist Canon—a great fortune for later learners—yet one must not cling to it for self-comfort. My late teacher, in recounting this, never allowed himself such ease, so profound was his warning to later disciples. Thus, I record it here to admonish myself.

Someone asked: “I have heard there are five ranks of immortals. Do they all follow the same Way?”

I answered: “They do not. The Way of the Celestial Immortals refines the Ninefold Return and Sevenfold Reversion into the Golden Elixir, completing both life and nature, forging an indestructible vajra-body, and manifesting a hundred million transformations, hidden or revealed beyond measure. This is the Way transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas.

The Way of the Earthly Immortals reverses the postnatal to restore the prenatal, returning to non-being and recovering the root to revive life, condensing spirit and gathering qi to preserve form and prolong existence—achieving undying longevity.

The Way of the Ranked Immortals involves receiving the talismans of the Three Bureaus and refining the wondrous methods of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, enabling flight through clouds and mist, evading the Three Calamities and Eight Difficulties, and moving without obstruction. This is the Way of the Southern Palace’s protective arts.

The Way of the Ghostly Immortals cultivates the emptiness of true nature, exhausting the past and foreseeing the future, exiting through the yin-spirit in *shijie*, avoiding evil destinies. This is the Way of preserving form through the Dao.

The Way of the Incipient Immortals subdues body and mind, nurtures essence and qi, prolongs life without suffering—this is the Way of cultivating the postnatal.

Of these five ranks, only the Earthly Immortal, by advancing one step further and practicing the Way of Non-Action, may ascend to the rank of Celestial Immortal. The others are all subject to kalpic reckoning; to attain the rank of Celestial Immortal, many barriers remain. Without the alchemy of the Golden Elixir to transmute them, success is nearly impossible.”

---

[Corroboration: I heard my late teacher, Master Taixu, say: “Those who refine the generative substance of the Supreme Ultimate as their sacred embryo attain the rank of Celestial Immortal. Those who refine the generative substance of Heaven-and-Earth as their sacred embryo attain the rank of Earthly Immortal. Those who refine the primordial true yin and true yang of the Void as their sacred embryo attain the rank of Divine Immortal. Those who refine the generative substance of the living dragon and lively tiger in the Void as their embryo attain the rank of Human Immortal. If one further knows how to draw in the One of the Supreme Ultimate to transmute it, this is the Water Immortal—unpredictable in transformation, slightly inferior to the Celestial Immortal, and not merely indestructible.”]

Someone asked: “To become a sage, an immortal, or a buddha—are these not all called ‘attaining the Dao’?”

Someone asked: “Why is it called the Golden Elixir, and why is it also called the Ninefold Return, Sevenfold Reversion, Golden Liquid, Great Return Elixir? Why speak not of the Dao but of the Elixir?”

The master replied: “The Dao is the primordial undifferentiated qi, what is called the Supreme Ultimate. The Elixir is perfect and unblemished, lively and free, an image of the Supreme Ultimate. The Elixir is the Dao, the Dao is the Elixir—their names are two, but their principle is one. Gold is a substance that endures through ancient and modern times without decay, coeval with Heaven and Earth; we take it for its firmness. Nine is the complete number of metal; seven is the complete number of fire—both belong to yang. ‘Return’ and ‘reversion’ mean restoring to the state of pure yang without yin. The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet the method requires action. Because of its non-action, the transformations of yin and yang cannot be without loss. The sage employs the method of cultivation: refining with metal and fire. This can restore what is deficient to wholeness and ensure that what is whole remains eternally unblemished. It returns to the Supreme Ultimate, returns to the Ultimateless, and reaches the state of no sound, no scent, the realm of profound stillness. Heaven and Earth may perish, but this does not perish—hence it is called the Ninefold Return, Sevenfold Reversion, Golden Liquid, Great Return Elixir. It is called the Elixir because it is named for the process of refinement through fire.”

Someone asked: “In cultivating this Great Elixir, is it better to practice in activity or in stillness?”

The master replied: “The Dao pervades waking and sleeping, reaches the hidden and the manifest, unbound by movement or stillness. As for the great cultivator, lively and free, outwardly rounded and inwardly square—why not dwell in the marketplace or serve at court?”

Someone asked: “In the marketplace or at court, one cannot avoid human sentiments and worldly affairs. How can one focus wholeheartedly on cultivating the Dao?”

The master replied: “Precisely in the marketplace and at court is the place to exert great function and activate great mechanism—this is the highest level of practice. The Golden Elixir exists within humanity and is sought within the marketplace and court. The ancients, dwelling in bustling capitals, relied on those with power to accomplish this—this is the very point! ”

Someone asked: “The Dao is in the Void, yet also in humanity, in the marketplace and court—why is this?”

The master replied: “Because it is in the Void, the common people use it daily without knowing. If they knew it, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, all would be the Dao. Humanity is the proper place for cultivation; the marketplace and court are the best places for action. How could it be that only in stillness, with the body at rest and all dharmas empty, is the Dao level?”

Someone asked: “If walking, standing, sitting, and lying down are all the Dao, why is there also the practice of refining sleep?”

The master replied: “Refining sleep is a matter for beginners. When ordinary people sleep, their spirit enters the cavern of yin, and their qi disperses to the four limbs. In dreams, they are upside-down, falling into nets, cauldrons, pits, and traps without exception. What is accumulated during the day is not equal to what is depleted at night. Therefore, one must temper the demon of sleep, causing the heart-spirit to reside in its chamber, the clear qi to ascend, and the turbid qi to descend—only then can the Dao be practiced without obstruction. The ancient immortals said: ‘Sleeping for an hour is dying for an hour. Sleeping for a day is dying for a day. With daily progress, one thousand days without sleep will suffice.’ They also said: ‘One year without sleep, the lower elixir forms; two years without sleep, the middle elixir forms; three years without sleep, the upper elixir forms.’ This is certain speech. If in emptiness, light is born, and spirit-illumination is constant, then even in sleep one remains awake—there is no harm in sleeping. The *Cantong Qi* says: ‘In sleep, the spirit embraces the gods; upon waking, one awaits the signs of life and death.’ This is not sleep that harms the work. Until one reaches this state, one must not sleep. The elder Zhang of Guoqing in Shu, and Zhang of Huangzhong—the Sleeping Immortals—both began by refining sleep and later achieved prolonged sleep. This is the proof of refining sleep.”

Someone asked: “Are there three elixirs: the upper, middle, and lower elixir?”

Answer: “It is all one elixir, but spoken of in parts. The lower elixir refines essence into qi. The middle elixir refines qi into spirit. The upper elixir refines spirit to return to emptiness. The three elixirs are named according to their stages. When one reaches the stage of returning to emptiness, essence, qi, and spirit merge into one qi—this is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor. The scriptures’ teachings on the ‘three fields’ and ‘three passes’ refer to this.

[Verification: Now, elixir methods do not mean refining essence today, qi tomorrow, and spirit the next day. Rather, all three methods are present within a single moment. Just as in a single elixir text, though the stages from beginning to end are many, one does not practice one stage today and another tomorrow. All stages are traversed within a single moment without omission, thus avoiding the risk of imbalance. Yet this is far beyond what those who have not opened the passes can achieve.

The passes consist of the three front and three rear passes. Opening the passes regulates the Conception and Governor Vessels. The three front passes regulate the Conception Vessel, while the three rear passes regulate the Governor Vessel. Only when the Conception Vessel is open can the Governor Vessel be regulated. In principle, this is so, but in practice, it is not. Rather, one regulates them directly through inhalation and exhalation.

During inhalation, qi is drawn from the Yin Heel Point at the perineum. From this point, it ascends in reverse, passing through the tailbone and spine, crossing the occiput to reach the crown, and entering the Heavenly Valley. The crown is Kunlun—man’s head. The Heavenly Valley is the center of the human brain, the upper elixir field. From the brain, it descends through the nose to the upper lip, where it meets the Conception Vessel at the Flower Pool. The Flower Pool is beneath the tongue, and the philtrum is its location—this is the established method for regulating the Governor Vessel.

Exhalation begins at the Flower Pool, following the path through the Jade Pillow (the chest) and reaching the Central Yellow (the middle elixir field). From there, it descends to the abdomen, settling in the deep region behind the navel, called the Sea of Qi—the lower elixir field. From there, it reaches the Yin Heel Point, located before the anus and behind the scrotum, where the Conception and Governor Vessels intersect—this is the established method for entering the Conception Vessel.

All this is achieved by guiding qi with intention, aligning thought with the Dao. This is the established method beginners must use to open the passes. As Ancestor Lü said: ‘When the three threes are open, half the work is done; when spirit opens them, the gentle wind is at rest.’ The gentle wind refers to nasal breathing. When the heart is utterly still and breath becomes so subtle it seems closed, this is the method of fetal breathing. When the Dao reaches fetal breathing, it is the spiritual achievement after the three threes are open—it is not a separate spiritual attainment.

At first, students must rely on guiding breath through inhalation and exhalation with intention. Once the passes are open and the three fields are unobstructed, as practice deepens into extreme emptiness and profound stillness, this fetal breathing naturally dissolves, becoming true breathing. Breath here means cessation. When practice attains true cessation, breathing ceases, all meridians stop, the six bowels and five viscera settle into perfect harmony, and the primordial qi is gathered from this stage.

Students must understand that ‘cessation’ and ‘breath’ refer to the utmost subtlety, where one is unaware of beginning or end. This is the qi circulating throughout the body. All the fine stages of elixir texts are encompassed within this single moment, circulating without omission. The great function of elixir texts—seizing the transformations of creation—must not be underestimated. Practicing thus daily without interruption, one will surely attain the rank of Heavenly Immortal, let alone lesser achievements.

The essentials lie in ‘two transformations,’ ‘one return,’ and ‘two unions.’ Now, step by step, returning again and again, daily progress may seem insufficient, but monthly progress is more than enough. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘Not far—return.’ It also says: ‘If one does not constantly maintain virtue, disgrace may follow.’ The practice is alive and fluid, depending on the individual. Let students take heed.]”

Someone asked, “Are essence, qi, and spirit postcelestial or precelesetial?”

The master replied, “They are precelesetial. The *Heart Seal Scripture* says: ‘The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence; dimly discerned, faintly perceived; invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing; from Nonbeing guard Being, and in an instant they are accomplished.’ How could they be regarded as postcelestial, tangible things? Thus, the great practitioner refines precelesetial primordial essence, and the essence of intercourse naturally does not leak; refines precelesetial primordial qi, and the qi of breathing and exhaling naturally harmonizes; refines precelesetial spirit, and the spirit of thought and emptiness naturally attains stillness. When the precelesetial is accomplished, the postcelestial is transformed. Let students diligently cultivate and practice, and only then will they see results. Otherwise, even the postcelestial cannot be preserved—how much less the precelesetial?”

---

Someone asked, “If it is said to be accomplished in an instant, why then speak of refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness?”

The master replied, “Accomplishment in an instant is the effect of obtaining the medicine. Refining essence, refining qi, and refining spirit are the gradual work of cultivation and the subtleties of the firing process.”

---

Someone asked, “The three superior medicines all belong to the precelesetial—is the Golden Elixir formed from these three?”

The master replied, “Though the three medicines belong to the precelesetial, they are formless and imageless, still belonging to yin, and cannot congeal the sacred embryo. Only when transformed by the precelesetial True One qi of emptiness and nonbeing can the formless generate form, the insubstantial generate substance, and the three medicines become purely yang!”

---

Someone asked, “If the formless generates form and the insubstantial generates substance, does the sacred embryo then have an appearance?”

The master replied, “It is a dharma-body, not a material form. The dharma-body is form yet not form. For this single qi congeals from emptiness and nonbeing, and is also called the yang spirit. When this spirit gathers, it takes form; when it scatters, it becomes qi. It enters water yet does not drown, enters fire yet is not burned; tigers and rhinoceroses cannot harm it, blades cannot strike it.”

“It moves freely without obstruction, unlike the corporeal body burdened by great suffering.”

Someone asked, “What of those who release the yin spirit?”

The master replied, “That is the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. Those who fully realize the true suchness of their nature—once true suchness is realized, the will remains undivided, and thus congeals into spirit. Over time, when stillness reaches its utmost, the spirit departs, traversing a thousand miles in an instant, perceiving the distant and knowing the future. Yet this is but a ghost-immortal, without shadow or form. Should one desire form, one must undergo rebirth, seeking out the enlightened in the next life to cultivate the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid and thereby attain it. Thus, the great cultivator, having completed the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir, proceeds to refine the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid, aspiring to reach the state of pure yang without yin and nothing more.”

[Verification: I once heard my late master, Tai Xu, say, “Even those who have attained ghost-immortality but have not shed the physical body—though they know of the supreme Mahayana—may still seek the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid through a swift method. They must empty and still the body and mind, extinguish sensory awareness, block perception and hearing, and cut off all thoughts, returning to the state of an infant before it can cry. With single-minded sincerity, they must welcome the True One of the Limitless, and the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid will naturally be swiftly obtained. Then, as if awakening from a dream, they will spontaneously ignite the true fire, neither martial nor literary, refining and nurturing it. One day, when yin is transformed into pure yang, the way of celestial immortality may be learned. Yet one must beforehand regard existence and nonexistence with indifference, remain unshaken by alarm, unmoved by joy, and beyond all this, view everything as dream, illusion, bubble, or shadow. Only then can the True One remain constant, and the postnatal be transformed by the primordial.

This primordial is the ‘cause,’ meaning dependence—dependence on the True One bestowed by the Limitless. This bestowed One is the mother of the Golden Fluid, capable of illuminating the body. The yin of the body is the Three Treasures within us: in the body, it is the prenatal; at its extreme, it is the postnatal—still a yin entity, transformed only by dependence on the One. Yet at this stage, the power of discernment in the body must inevitably diminish; one must not grow lazy. Initially, one may feel unable to sustain it, but gradually, one returns to the original state, entering ever greater peace. The limbs grow stronger, the complexion radiant, the eyes luminous. Then, by aligning with the celestial pivot and reflecting the True One within, one’s own True One is daily renewed. With unwavering devotion, how could one fail to fully restore the primordial unity and even see worldly wealth overflow? When the time is ripe, the Great Return Elixir descends, and one need never fear sinking into water or entering fire.” He also said, “If a ghost-immortal, having attained the Dao, does not add further practices, when calamity strikes and the four elements are no longer one’s own, with no refuge to rely on and no desire to transmigrate, how can one open a new path?”

My late master left this discourse, which I have carefully appended here to supplement what Wu Yuanzi did not address. Scholars may use it for verification.]

Someone asked, “Are those who seize wombs, usurp bodies, or return to old dwellings this yin spirit?”

The master replied, “No. The yin spirit of true suchness is the primordial spirit. It is called yin only because one has not fully realized the mandate. As for those who seize wombs or usurp bodies, they merely manipulate the consciousness-spirit, clinging to the seeds of samsara, utterly unrelated to the Great Dao. Thus, they pass from one existence to another, endlessly cycling through birth and death. Their only difference from ordinary people is that they cannot choose their dwelling place and do not enter other species. How could they ever achieve the clarity of mind, realization of nature, or the ability to enter samadhi and release the spirit?”

Someone asked, “If one has realized nature but not the mandate, will one be deluded in the next life?”

The master replied, “Some will be deluded, others not. Those not deluded are born with innate knowledge of the principles of nature and seek the Great Elixir to complete the Great Dao. The deluded lose their former path and require the guidance of an enlightened teacher to awaken to past causes. Consider the Ming dynasty’s top scholar, the Perfected Luo—had his father not reminded him, he might have nearly forgotten! Though deluded, he still possessed karmic roots, so a single reminder sufficed to awaken him. Without such roots, no reminder could rouse him. This applies not only to those who have realized nature but also to those of earnest aspiration who study the Dao their entire lives without encountering an enlightened teacher. After death, they are reborn with karmic roots. As soon as they emerge, they know of this great matter and remain within the Dao, refining it through myriad methods, single-mindedly devoted to cultivation, indifferent to glory, wealth, and nobility. All such people possess karmic roots. Without them, even if one is orphaned, impoverished, or faces a hundred hardships, one would rather endure suffering to the end than enter this path.”

Someone asked, “Those who cultivate nature must return to the human world to complete the Great Dao. Those who cultivate the mandate attain a lifespan equal to heaven’s—surely they do not return?”

The master replied, “Some do return. The arts of extending life are not attainable by those who are not true great men, nor practicable by those who are not of heaven-endowed supreme wisdom. Even if one attains them, one must also possess deep ancestral virtue, great personal merit, and countless celestial affinities converging to proceed without hindrance, smoothly and sequentially, to complete this great task. If one’s ancestors lack virtue, or one’s own karmic roots are shallow, though one may forge ahead boldly, the mandate may expire before the task is done.”

“Or one may be hindered just as one’s merit begins to take effect, and demonic obstacles arrive prematurely. Often there are those who possess the method but lack the resources, who grasp the Dao but lack the strength, and many perish while still embracing the Way. Though they may not have completed the Dao, their comings and goings are clearly distinct from those of ordinary people. Some die after achieving half their merit, others before reaching halfway. Those who die after half their merit is done will surely be born with innate knowledge in their next life. Those who die before reaching halfway will surely be born with the resolve to pursue the Dao. Thus, those who study the Dao must recognize their own karmic roots and not abandon themselves in despair—for once one loses the human form, it is difficult to regain for ten thousand kalpas.”

Someone asked, “Those born with knowledge—can they cultivate without seeking a teacher and succeed on their own?”

The master replied, “Though they possess innate understanding, they still have points of confusion. Without encountering an enlightened teacher to guide them, they will not attain the Dao. If they meet such guidance, they will suddenly awaken to perfect comprehension, resolving all doubts at once. From there, their practice will unfailingly lead to completion. I have encountered two such born-knowing individuals: one was Master Gu of Jiangsu, the other Master Wang of Longxi. Master Gu was deluded by his official career, Master Wang by the pursuit of wealth. Though they knew the Way, they did not value their nature and life—this was the source of their confusion. Such individuals must surely lack great ancestral virtue and personal merit, which is why they remain entangled, unable to escape the net. Who knows what their next life will bring? How lamentable!

Later learners, should you not cultivate virtue early?”

“A disciple asked, ‘Does this disciple possess past-life roots?’

The master replied, ‘Without past-life roots, how could you have heard the name of the Great Dao? How could you have heard the teachings of the Great Dao? Whether you possess past-life roots or not, you yourself do not know. I have a few words for you—you will know for yourself.’

Then he spoke a gatha:
*In a former life, your surname was Yuan,
In this life, your surname is Lu.
Yuan was named Chengde,
Lu is named Wogu.
This is the cause and effect between past and present—
Examine your steps carefully.
The meaning is quite clear—
Awaken early, you must awaken early.*

At these words, the disciple suddenly awakened. Kneeling, he offered a song:
*Having awakened to past and future lives,
Others are myself, and I am others.
Breaking open the chaos to enter the numinous cave,
I see at last that original, singular truth.
This singular truth is like dew or lightning—
No head, no tail, no face.
Pillar of heaven, pillar of earth, beyond thought,
In the dim and distant, transformation arises.
Fortunately, the kind teacher secretly revealed it,
So I recognize this ancient treasure.
The true countenance is right before my eyes—
Why labor elsewhere to establish practice?’*

Between master and disciple, in their exchange of questions and answers, they unknowingly saw the eastern sky brighten and the earth suffused with light. The disciples dispersed to attend to their duties. Master Wuyuan then strolled alone to the Pavilion of Cleansing the Heart.”

The Purple Clarity Elder states:
“That essence is not the essence of intercourse—
it is the saliva in the Jade Emperor’s mouth.
That qi is not the qi of breath—
know instead it is the mist of primordial simplicity.
That spirit is not the spirit of thought—
it may stand shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.”

These are what is called primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit. To call essence, qi, and spirit "primordial" is to speak of the things that are originally so. Before this body existed, these things already were; only afterward did the formless give rise to form, the insubstantial give rise to substance. They come from the time before father and mother united. At the moment of union, when the father’s essence has not yet been released and the mother’s blood has not yet enclosed, when emotions merge and intentions align, within that dim and distant state there is something—barriers secretly dissolve, and all becomes one, an undispersed cloud of mist. Then, as essence is discharged and blood receives it, essence and blood fuse, enclosing this single truth, transforming and taking shape. Already, essence, qi, and spirit reside within the form. Though called three, they are in truth one. "One" refers to the meaning of the primordial undifferentiated; "three" refers to the division of the numinous. One is the substance; three are the functions. For the primordial undifferentiated substance is pure and unadulterated as essence, flows through the blood vessels as qi, and is empty and lively as spirit. Three yet one, one yet three.

The so-called "three grades of superior medicine" are the functions; the so-called "complete and perfect" is the substance. One cannot speak only of three, nor only of one. Many learners do not understand that three are one and one are three. Some cling to the primordial and guard the one, falling into attachment to emptiness; others refine the three grades of medicine, losing themselves in attachment to form. Attachment to emptiness or form—neither is the wondrous principle of returning to the origin. To return to the origin is to return to primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit.

If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, one must first know that these three things lie hidden within the primordial undifferentiated. Separated from the primordial undifferentiated, they are no longer the original substance of primordial essence, qi, and spirit; losing this original substance, they are no longer the primordial things.

The *Heart Seal Scripture* says:
“The three grades of superior medicine—
spirit, qi, and essence.
Dimly, faintly, obscurely, profoundly,
seen yet unseen,
heard yet unheard...”

"From nonbeing guard being, and in an instant it is accomplished."

Called "dimly, faintly," called "obscurely, profoundly," called "being and nonbeing"—this reveals it as a formless thing. Only this primordial essence is like a pearl, like dew, pure and unadulterated, moistening the hundred bones; primordial qi is like smoke, like mist, threading through the hundred vessels; primordial spirit is most numinous, most sagely, governing all affairs. Knowing this, one may prolong life and extend years, attaining ageless longevity. If the cultivator can recognize these three medicines, then the cultivation of the Dao holds promise.

[Verification: If the cultivator can from the primordial undifferentiated embody and recognize the Three Treasures, they will not err. Moreover, the compassionate instruction of "moistening" and the like reveals the meaning of "nonbeing that is not nonbeing"—as clear as words on the palm, sufficient for realization. Having attained it, guard it, and one will not fall into attachment to emptiness. If one can reflect on the "from nonbeing" secret, one will not fall into attachment to form. The essential words of the ancient sages rely entirely on spiritual apprehension; hearing but not understanding is enough to lead one astray. If after reading this passage one still clings to form or emptiness, what more can I do!]

Postnatal essence, qi, and spirit.

Postnatal essence is the essence of intercourse. Postnatal qi is the qi of respiration. Postnatal spirit is the spirit of thought. These three are tangible and manifest, things that arise only after the body’s birth.

When male and female unite, essence and blood merge to form the embryo. Within the womb, there is only primordial qi, and no qi of respiration. When the ten months of gestation are complete and the child emerges from the womb, at the moment of birth, with a cry, it receives the tangible qi of Heaven and Earth, which enters the cinnabar field and unites with the primordial qi. From then on, qi moves in and out through the mouth and nose, externally connecting with the qi of Heaven and Earth—this is the root of respiratory qi.

Postnatal spirit also arises at this moment; this spirit is the consciousness that transmigrates through kalpas. It arrives first at birth and departs first at death. Whether one becomes human or beast, whether one does good or evil—it is this. Whether one is born or dies—it is this. Moving from this to that, shifting from old to new, there is nothing that is not this.

At the very moment of the newborn’s cry upon touching the earth, this spirit enters its aperture—thus, if an infant does not cry at birth, it cannot speak, for no spirit has entered its aperture. At the time of birth, spirit and qi govern one another, forming the root of the postnatal and the basis for the growth of the illusory body. As for the essence of sexual union, it is entirely a product of later existence. While in the womb, there is no such essence; even at birth, the body possesses none. Only when one reaches the age of sixteen, with primordial yang qi at its fullest, does it inevitably overflow and, having reached its peak, return. When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; as yin arises, yang wanes. Yin qi takes charge, and yang qi retreats. The formless yin then generates the tangible yin: the aperture in the kidneys opens, true water diminishes, and the fire of desire subtly arises. With the slightest stimulation, this fire flares upward, steaming the entire body, stirring the blood and vessels of the hundred bones, and boiling the fluids of the five viscera and six bowels. All surges upward to gather at the Baihui acupoint atop the head—this point being where the hundred vessels converge. From here, qi and blood descend along the spine to the Shenshu acupoint, where they first transform into a white substance, then pass through the Weilu to reach the yin aperture and finally discharge. This essence did not exist at birth, nor even afterward—it is merely the transformation of qi and blood! The kidney aperture is but the gate through which essence exits; how could essence ever reside in the kidneys? The so-called essence of sexual union arises only through union and sensation; without union or sensation, there is no essence. Even nocturnal emissions occur due to sensation; if they happen without sensation, it is because the kidneys are weak and the blood vessels unstable, with pathogenic fire driving the essence out. This is the origin of the essence of sexual union.

When yang reaches its extreme and yin arises, not only does essence come into being, but thoughts and deliberations also emerge, and the breath of respiration becomes coarse. Scholars must recognize that these three—essence, thought, and breath—are all products of existence after birth, not of existence before birth. If one relies on things that arise after birth to preserve life, prolong years, and transcend yin and yang, is this possible? Scholars should ponder this deeply.

[Verification: It is noted that the ancients cherished these three substances of the body, for if one can return them, the three may revert to the One, and what was later becomes no longer later. In essence, the method lies in nothing more than "returning to the nonexistent."]

**Primordial True Unity of Qi**
Yuan Duzi said: “The primordial qi comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness.”
*The Awakening to Reality* states: “The Dao, from emptiness and nothingness, generates the One qi; from this One qi, yin and yang are produced.”
The *Daoguang* says: “There is a thing prior to Heaven and Earth, nameless and originally quiescent. It can be the master of the myriad forms, yet does not fade with the four seasons.”
All these speak of primordial qi as the ancestral qi of living things, arising from emptiness and nothingness, the master of the myriad forms and the origin of Heaven and Earth. It is formless and imageless, soundless and odorless—unseen to the eye, unheard to the ear, and untouchable by the hand. Yet though formless, it can generate form; though imageless, it can generate images. In terms of its spirit, it is the spirit beyond spirits; in terms of its qi, it is the true unity of qi; in terms of its essence, it is the true unity of essence, also called the true seed, the golden elixir, or the immortal formula of another house. It cannot be compared to the qi of postnatal respiration, the spirit of deliberation, or the essence of sexual union, nor is it the same as primordial essence, primordial qi, or primordial spirit. For primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit, when in the postnatal realm, are yang, but when returning to the primordial, they become yin. Unlike the primordial true unity of qi, which remains indestructible through ten thousand kalpas, transcends all beings, and stands alone in honor—unbound by life and death, unconstrained by existence and nonexistence—it is the root of postnatal essence, qi, and spirit, and the sovereign of primordial essence, qi, and spirit. It is the most yang of things, the treasure of Heaven, yet few recognize it.

This thing is neither within nor without, neither bound by the five aggregates nor the eight consciousnesses, neither in the five viscera nor the six bowels, neither at the gates of the six senses nor in the hundred bones and apertures. It resides solely in the mysterious pass, the one aperture. If one seeks it with intention, one clings to form; if one guards it without intention, one clings to emptiness. It cannot be grasped by thought or discussed in words. It has always existed, yet when yang gives rise to yin, it flees to another house and is no longer ours. The perfected person employs methods to pursue and gather it, making the substantial insubstantial and the tangible intangible. Stirred, it takes form, coming from the midst of emptiness.

To refine and cultivate it, one employs the yin tally and yang fire to forge the elixir, coalescing it into a single grain as small as a millet seed. Swallowing and ingesting it, one ignites the treasure of the primordial, transforming non-being into being; transmutes the acquired into the innate, turning yin into yang. The Three Corpses and Five Thieves vanish without trace; the eighty-four thousand hair-spirit deities all become protectors of the Dao. Thus it is said: *"A single grain of golden elixir swallowed into the belly—only then does one know one’s fate is not ruled by Heaven."*

The deluded do not recognize this primordial True Unity of qi as the ancestral qi that gives life to all things, the primal qi before the separation of the Great Vagueness, the numinous root at the dawn of chaos. Some mistake *yuan* qi for the primordial True Unity; others take the qi of breathing in the cinnabar field as the primordial True Unity; still others regard embracing oneness and guarding the center as preserving the primordial True Unity, or seeing emptiness and stilling thoughts as observing the primordial True Unity. Then there are those hell-bound seeds who refine the five metals and eight minerals, or gather red lead and plum blossoms, believing these to be the ingestion of the primordial True Unity. How could such myriad divergent paths ever speak of the primordial True Unity?

The primordial True Unity of qi is the primordial ancestral qi that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and all beings. Vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all measure; in movement and stillness it is undivided, in yin and yang it is perfectly blended. In the primordial, it gives rise to yin and yang; in the acquired, it conceals itself within yin and yang. It is the true One, not the false one. To embrace and guard the true One—how could the true One be embraced or guarded? If it could be embraced or guarded, it would not be the true One, and what one embraces or guards would surely be the false one. To observe and still the true One—how could the true One be observed or stilled? If it could be observed or stilled, it would not be the true One, and what one observes or stills would surely be the false.

As for the thousand gates and ten thousand doors of the various heterodox schools, all mistake the thief for the son, abandon the correct to follow the perverse, and do not know what the true Unity of qi truly is. No wonder they reach old age without accomplishment and fall into emptiness and ruin!

When Wu Yuan first encountered the old man of Kan Valley, he was shown the great Dao of cultivating reality, with all matters made clear. Only the phrase *"the primordial qi comes from the midst of emptiness"* remained obscure to him, eluding his vision for thirteen years. He pored over elixir scriptures but never grasped its essence. Later, he met the Immortal Liu Zhangren, who pierced the source and origin, cracked open the iron pellet, and spoke with such clarity that all became luminous in his heart. Only then did he realize that true emptiness is truly empty, and the true One is truly one—not possessed by oneself, nor obtained from another; beyond words or images, grasped only through intention, apprehended only through spirit. Released, it pervades the six directions; gathered, it retreats into secrecy. It penetrates Heaven and Earth, enabling one to become a sage or a worthy, to attain immortality or buddhahood—all arising from this.

If one knows this primordial True Unity of qi, the great foundation is established, and all else is but secondary. Thus the ancient immortals said: *"Obtain the One, and all things are complete."*

---

**Verification:** With the proper method of cultivation, every step becomes the Dao. The ancient immortals said: *"Wherever green willows grow, one may tether a horse; every household’s gate opens onto Chang’an."* To seek the true One, one must practice sincerely and attain realization naturally—without profound cultivation, there is no chance of success. For the Dao expounded by Wu Yuan is the primordial great Dao, purely concerned with returning to the origin. If one does not place body and mind prior to the primordial, the mysterious pass will not open.

Thus, according to Wu Yuan’s revealed practice: without natural attainment, the primordial does not manifest, and what one obtains is not genuine. Only by embracing, guarding, observing, and stilling—beginning the work prior to the primordial and deeply cultivating the natural state—does one’s entire spirit verify the One. Seeking the One through the One is as easy as turning a hand. How could there be the flaw of mistaking the false for the true?

Based on what I have heard and this exposition, the essential warnings are against the two schools of *"red lead and plum blossoms"* and *"five metals and eight minerals."* The ancient sages practiced these methods only as catalytic agents, for they possess profound and wondrous functions. If used for ingestion, they are not the methods of the divine immortals and must be firmly rejected. Beyond these two, every other school may lead to fruition, but all must proceed from non-being as the principle. In the sequence of non-being, one must follow the order of internal observation, external observation, and distant observation. Only when one attains emptiness beyond emptiness, stillness beyond stillness, may one advance to seek the sagely Dao, shatter the void, and become non-dual and non-separate from the primordial True Unity of the void. This is the way to obtain the primordial True Unity of qi—a teaching I received from the Primordial Void Master and verified with the True Man of Jizu Mountain, offered here to supplement what Master Wu Yuan did not expound.

**The True and False Body and Mind**
People today speak only of body and mind, knowing only the illusory body and mind while unaware of the true body and mind. Abandoning the true to follow the false, no wonder their lifespan is not yet exhausted, yet body and mind are already weary, their form like that of the living while their soul enters the ghostly cavern!

Why is this so? The illusory body is the fleshly body; the illusory mind is the human mind. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intention all arise from the illusory body. Joy, anger, sorrow, joy, love, aversion, and desire all arise from the human mind. At the gates of the six senses, every encounter can destroy life. The seven emotions and deluded thoughts, each and every one, can lead to death. A bump or a collision, and they erupt. How many escape without harm to life and destiny? To regard the illusory body and mind as real is to take the thief as one’s son and the servant as one’s master. When Heaven does not grant more years, where will the body be?

Where does the heart reside? Without doubt, it is an illusory thing. As for the true body, it is the Dharma-body. The true heart is the Heavenly Heart. Yin and yang, the Five Phases—all arise from the Dharma-body. Infant boy, maiden girl, Wood Mother, Metal Duke, Yellow Dame, coral, giant clam, crystal, jade, gold—all are born of the Heavenly Heart. The five natures and causes are all seeds of Dao-attainment. The five supreme treasures are all resources for elixir-refinement. Gather them, cultivate them, and one may raise the dead, restore youth, and reverse aging.

Yet most do not recognize this Dharma-body and Heavenly Heart. Thus, the Dharma-body lies buried while the illusory body acts; the Heavenly Heart retreats while the human heart rules. Therefore, birth after birth, death after death, the wheel of rebirth turns endlessly, without cessation. Now, this Dharma-body supports heaven above and props up the earth below. It has no head, no tail, no back, no front, standing upright without leaning. In its hardness, it shatters empty space; in its softness, the ten thousand transformations all cease. In its firmness, it enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning, passes through metal and stone unimpeded. Tiger spells cannot harm it, blades and weapons cannot strike it—here lies the abode of life. This Heavenly Heart is neither defiled nor pure, utterly empty yet utterly numinous. Still and unmoving, it responds when stirred. In stillness, it is soundless and odorless; in motion, it is supremely divine and wondrous. In form and image, it is like a crescent moon, like an upturned bowl, like a millet grain—neither form nor emptiness, yet both form and emptiness; neither being nor non-being, yet both being and non-being—here lies the abode of nature.

Know this body and heart, and cultivate nature and life—then completing nature and life becomes as easy as turning one’s palm. Thus the ancients said: *"These two words, body and heart, lie hidden in ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures."* If the illusory body and human heart were so clear and bright that even the foolish could understand, why would ten thousand alchemical texts conceal them? The reason for concealment must lie in some secret, unspeakable truth—how could one regard the illusory body and heart as the true matter?

Alas! Is the body and heart so easily known? Without decades of exhaustive effort to fathom principle, the Dharma-body is not easily seen, the Heavenly Heart not easily understood. Without knowing body and heart, how can one cultivate nature and life? Scholars, take heed.

---

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach life."* The ancient immortals said: *"To cultivate nature without cultivating life is like a ghost of yin for ten thousand kalpas—hard to attain sagehood. To cultivate life without cultivating nature is like having family wealth without a master’s authority."* These all speak of the dual cultivation of nature and life. Yet nature has the principle of nature, and life has the principle of life—without exhausting principle, one cannot know them.

Now, nature has the Heaven-endowed nature and the qi-endowed nature; life has the fate of heavenly decree and the life of Dao-qi. The Heaven-endowed nature is good knowledge and good ability, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs. The qi-endowed nature is the difference between worthy and foolish, wise and unworthy, depending on whether one’s qi is clear or turbid, upright or perverse. The fate of heavenly decree is the unevenness of early death and longevity, poverty and wealth, success and failure. The life of Dao-qi is firmness, purity, and unity—equalizing life and death, enduring through kalpas, unopposed by heaven and earth, unbound by yin and yang.

The Heaven-endowed nature is true; the qi-endowed nature is false. The life of Dao-qi is true; the fate of heavenly decree is false. The true is the precelestial thing; the false is the postcelestial thing. The precelestial lies beyond yin and yang; the postcelestial lies within yin and yang. This difference between true and false makes nature and life distinct. If cultivators know how to cultivate the Heaven-endowed nature to transform the qi-endowed nature, and cultivate the life of Dao-qi to turn the fate of heavenly decree, then the Dao of nature and life is attained.

Moreover, nature is born of the heart. The heart is the abode of spirit; when the heart is bright, the spirit is clear; when the spirit is clear, nature is settled—thus the creation of nature depends on the heart. Life is a knock on the human heart; knock, and it must respond; respond, and qi stirs; when qi stirs, it becomes the stem of life. The person is the body—thus the creation of life depends on the body. Life belongs to another’s household; nature belongs to one’s own. First seek the other’s method of immortality to establish life, then seek one’s own original possession to complete nature. Body and heart are not two; nature and life are one household—thus both nature and life are completed.

The side doors and external paths do not know what life is: some take postcelestial qi as life, some take the turbid essence in the kidneys as life, some take orders as life. They do not know what nature is: some take numinous awareness as nature, some take dull emptiness and extinction as nature, some take the qi-endowed nature as nature. These all speak of life without knowing the aperture of life, speak of nature without knowing the source of nature.

What is nature? It is that which knows not, recognizes not—following the decree of the Emperor on High, this is nature. Round and full, radiant and bright, pure and bare, unadorned and free—this is nature. When Qian meets Xun, gaze upon the Moon Grotto; the Moon Grotto is nature. Observe its wonder through desirelessness; wonder is nature.

What is life? The union of male and female, the transformation and birth of the myriad things—this is life. The thing within the indistinct and vague, the essence within the profound and obscure—this is life. When Earth meets Thunder, behold the Heavenly Root; the Heavenly Root is life. Observe its aperture through desire; the aperture is life.

Only when one thoroughly fathoms this nature and life is one truly knowing of nature and life. Only when one knows this nature and life can one cultivate nature and life.

Alas! Those who know are already few—how much rarer are those who cultivate? Why do seekers not discern this early?

[Verification: Here, the entirety of nature and life has been laid bare! Truly, without decades of arduous effort, one cannot fully comprehend.]

The precelestial and postcelestial yin and yang.

Precelestial yin and yang are being and non-being. Postcelestial yin and yang are heart and kidney. The yin and yang of being and non-being are formless; the yin and yang of heart and kidney have form. Being is the single yang within Kan, the true yang, the wondrous being. Non-being is the single yin within Li, the true yin, the true emptiness. That yang is called true demonstrates it is no false yang. That yin is called true demonstrates it is no false yin. Where true yin and true yang exist, false yin and false yang must also exist. True yin and yang emerge from the precelestial, operating within the Supreme Ultimate. False yin and yang arise from the postcelestial, stored within the body. False yin and yang endure while the body endures; when the body perishes, they perish and decay. True yin and yang emerge from the formless, operate in the imageless, and are imperishable.

Now, the yin and yang of heart and kidney are transformations of the essence and blood from the union of father and mother, possessing both qi and substance—thus they exist and cease with the body. As for precelestial yin and yang, they issue from the Dharma-body, born of the singular qi of emptiness and non-being, possessing qi but no substance—thus they endure as long as heaven and earth. This is the distinction between precelestial and postcelestial.

Yet though precelestial yin and yang are born of the precelestial, once the body exists, they are concealed within the postcelestial, belonging to Kan and Li. Kan is outwardly yin yet inwardly yang: its outer yin is postcelestial yin, its inner yang is precelestial yang. Li is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin: its outer yang is postcelestial yang, its inner yin is precelestial yin. This is another distinction between precelestial and postcelestial.

Moreover, postcelestial yin and yang operate only within the body, following the course of creation. At the zi hour, a single yang arises—within the kidney, a yang qi ascends, circulating the blood by day. At the wu hour, a single yin arises—within the heart, a yin qi descends, circulating the blood by night. Yin and yang alternate in motion, revolving day and night. Once the precelestial is buried and the postcelestial takes charge, excessive thought harms the spirit, and indulgence in desire depletes essence. Spirit and essence decline, qi is silently consumed, and when qi is exhausted, death follows.

As for precelestial yin and yang, they operate in the void, reversing the course of creation. When the living zi hour arrives at Kan, a single yang returns—advance the yang fire to generate and nurture. When the living wu hour arrives at Li, a single yin comes to unite—retreat the yin tally to warm and nourish the Dharma-body. When the Dharma-body is accomplished and the ten months of qi are fulfilled, the sacred embryo emerges—then one becomes an immortal. This is yet another distinction between precelestial and postcelestial.

Alas!

The postcelestial yin and yang of the body alone cannot complete nature and fulfill destiny—how much more grievous is the sin of those who take male and female as yin and yang and practice deviant arts? If scholars can truly distinguish between precelestial and postcelestial yin and yang, they should urgently seek a true master for verification, and thus may achieve attainment. If one fails to recognize the true and false of yin and yang, vainly hoping that a word or half a phrase could seize the workings of creation and transcend the mundane to attain sagehood—how could such a thing be possible? Should scholars not reflect deeply upon this?

[Verification: The distinctions drawn here are most precise; scholars should take them as their standard, for they mark the path to progress in the Dao. To sincerely apply oneself in this practice yields great efficacy—unlike the side doors, which mistakenly regard near and distant applications as rooted in the tangible and the phenomenal. Master Wuyuan’s warning that "a word or half a phrase cannot fathom the mysterious" precisely refers to the profound subtleties herein! Yet if one truly establishes their foundation prior to the precelestial, they will naturally find resources at every turn. The late Master Taixu said: "When cultivation reaches the state of no-self, the three powers (heaven, earth, and humanity) become one thing, each dividing into three yet merging in forgetfulness. The perfected ones of antiquity could take the three powers as the Dharma-body, use being and non-being as yin and yang, and regard the true One as the Wuji. Being and non-being do not move toward movement; movement and stillness do not abide in stillness. Serene and quiescent, beginning and end as one—this is the celestial mind within me. If the perfected ones of antiquity could achieve this, scholars should follow their example, progressing from the temporary to the constant, from effort to ease—is this not wondrous?" Such are my master’s profound teachings. This may supplement what Master Wuyuan’s discourse did not cover, and thus I record it for verification.]

**Internal and External Five Phases**
When the Five Phases converge, the Golden Elixir is formed; when the Golden Elixir wanes, the Five Phases disperse—this is an inevitable principle. Yet yin and yang are two, so the Five Phases cannot be one. Why? There are internal and external Five Phases; there are the internal and external Five Phases of heaven and the internal and external Five Phases of earth. The Five Phases of heaven govern movement, while the Five Phases of earth govern qi.

The Five Phases of heaven are the ten celestial stems: *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *wu*, *ji*, *geng*, *xin*, *ren*, and *gui*. The Five Phases of earth are the twelve earthly branches: *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, *si*, *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, and *hai*. *Jia*, *bing*, *geng*, *ren*, and *wu* are yang and external; *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, and *ji* are yin and internal. *Yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, and *xu* are yang and external; *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chou*, and *wei* are yin and internal.

Yet the Five Phases are but one—how can there be four? It is because the Five Phases arise from the two qi of yin and yang. The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of earth is established as soft and hard. The Five Phases of heaven are transformed by heaven’s yin and yang, with metal, wood, water, fire, and earth each possessing the qi of yin and yang. *Jia*, *bing*, *geng*, *ren*, and *wu* contain yang qi, while *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, and *ji* contain yin qi—these are heaven’s yin-yang Five Phases. The Five Phases of earth are transformed by earth’s hardness and softness, with metal, wood, water, fire, and earth each possessing the qi of hardness and softness. *Yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, and *xu* contain hard qi, while *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chou*, and *wei* contain soft qi—these are earth’s yin-yang Five Phases.

The Five Phases of heaven govern movement, yet within movement there is stillness—this stillness within movement refers to *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, and *ji*. The Five Phases of earth govern stillness, yet within stillness there is movement—this movement within stillness refers to *yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, and *xu*. Considering the entirety of heaven and earth, the Five Phases of heaven belong to the external, while the Five Phases of earth belong to the internal. Considering heaven and earth as separate forms, then among heaven’s Five Phases, *jia*, *bing*, *geng*, *ren*, and *wu* are external, while *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, and *ji* are internal; among earth’s Five Phases, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, and *xu* are external, while *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chou*, and *wei* are internal. These are the principles of the four Five Phases, internal and external, yin and yang.

The human body is likewise: it possesses the Five Phases of the celestial stems and the Five Phases of the earthly branches. The Five Phases of the celestial stems are: original nature, original emotion, original spirit, original essence, and original qi as yin; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust as yang. The Five Phases of the earthly branches are: wandering soul, ghostly corporeal soul, consciousness, turbid essence, and deluded intention as yin; joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire as yang. As for the yang of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, and the yin of the stomach, gallbladder, triple burner, bladder, and large and small intestines—these are postcelestial, tangible, and phenomenal turbid substances, and thus do not belong to the four Five Phases!

Only these four Five Phases, when considering the Dharma-body and the illusory body together, operate the celestial stems to move the earthly branches. When considering the Dharma-body and the illusory body separately, the Dharma-body embodies benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust to complete nature, emotion, spirit, essence, and qi, while the illusory body contains spirit, soul, corporeal soul, intention, joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire.

The above distinguishes the internal and external Five Phases of heaven, earth, and humanity. The Five Phases possess the Dao of mutual generation: metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and earth generates metal. They also possess the Dao of mutual restraint: metal restrains wood, wood restrains earth, earth restrains water, water restrains fire, and fire restrains metal. Moreover, there is the Dao of restraint within generation and generation within restraint. Restraint within generation is the postcelestial path of sequential movement; generation within restraint is the precelestial path of reverse operation. If scholars can understand generation and restraint, discerning the reverse and the sequential, then the principles of the Five Phases will be perfectly clear.

[Verification: These subtle principles should be thoroughly pondered in leisure and embodied in practice, each grasped clearly in mind and sight. Practice repeatedly, and with deep embodiment, even in busy moments one may act without confusion; when forgetting arises, one will naturally not deviate. Scholars must not mislead themselves—for a deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles.]

Since our birth, we have turned our backs on the Dao and strayed from the true, losing the natural ebb and flow within, deviating from measure and rule—far from the inner harmony of an infant. At the outset of cultivation, one must place the body in emptiness and establish the mind in stillness, neither forcing nor forgetting. In such profound tranquility, without place or time, this is what is meant by extinguishing the moving mind but not the illuminating mind. When one reaches the point where emptiness is not empty and stillness is not still, then one may focus entirely on inner perception—all that appears within arises from the precelestial, yet one merely observes it all with tranquil vision. Over time, the visions grow ever purer, and only then may one proceed to sustain them, judiciously adding or removing without error.

To lay the foundation, one must first thoroughly ponder this discourse, follow its steps in practice, and embody each stage—guarding against distraction and attachment, not allowing perceptions to disturb resolve, and setting aside thoughts of efficacy. Forgetting time and days in steadfast practice—this is the crucial admonition. When all illnesses of the body are wholly dispelled, one naturally moves step by step within the rule, attaining the wondrous subtlety of every drop returning to the source. Scholars must not dismiss this as mere platitude. Though your wisdom surpasses Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun], without true practice, you cannot enter the gate.

Thus spoke the late Master Taixu. I, Yuanzi, moved by his compassionate intent, have recorded his teachings to share with fellow seekers.

[Internal and External Medicinal Substances]

Medicinal substances are internal and external; practice unfolds in two stages. Those who cultivate the Dao yet do not understand the two medicines—internal and external—are like the blind groping their way or the deaf straining to hear, never grasping the method. What, then, are internal and external?

The internal medicine is what one already possesses; the external medicine comes from another. What one already possesses is *ling-mercury*; what another yields is *true-lead*. *Ling-mercury* is not quicksilver, nor is *true-lead* black tin—both are celestial treasures, not the impure substances of the world.

Now, *ling-mercury* is the *Radiant Maiden*, mistress within; *true-lead* is the *Infant Boy*, master without. Though *ling-mercury* is a heavenly treasure, its nature is restless—exposed to fire, it flees. Without *true-lead* to restrain it, it wanders without trace, inevitably mingling truth with falsehood, breeding harm from kindness, like a woman without a husband, unable to preserve her integrity. Thus, *true-lead* tempers *true-mercury*; lead and mercury unite, husband and wife are joined, and when fire arises, it serves rather than destroys.

This *ling-mercury* is already present within oneself, requiring no external search. But *true-lead*, born after yang reaches its peak and yin arises, departs to another’s domain, no longer belonging to oneself. One must first seek this substance, bring it back to one’s own house, and pair it with *true-mercury*—only then can the peril of yin and yang falling out of harmony be avoided. Since lead belongs to another and mercury to oneself, there arise the names *internal* and *external*, the distinction between *self* and *other*.

The alchemical classics speak of *seven returns*—this means returning *true-mercury* to its original nature; *nine refinements*—this means restoring *true-lead* to its original nature. As for the term *other’s domain*, it does not refer to a literal *self* and *other* but rather to *true-lead* before its arrival, belonging to the *external*; once it arrives, it belongs to the *internal*. The terms *external* and *other* are used only in reference to its state before arrival—not that there truly exists another domain. The distinction between *internal* and *external* follows the same logic.

Tracing back to the moment of birth and the reception of qi, lead and mercury were originally one qi, without division into *internal* or *external*, nor separation into *self* and *other*. Only when the circle reaches its fullness and begins to wane do lead and mercury part ways, giving rise to the distinctions of *self* and *other*, *internal* and *external*.

Yet this lead and mercury have two meanings, which must not be overlooked. During the refinement of the *Returned Elixir*, one takes *black lead* to restrain *red mercury*; lead and mercury unite, forming the *Returned Elixir*—this is one distinction between the two internal and external medicines. Once the *Returned Elixir* is formed, it is also called *true-lead*. Ingesting this *true-lead*, it transforms one’s own *yin-mercury*, drying it in an instant. Then, using the now-dry mercury to nurture *true-lead*, the *Great Elixir* is formed—this is another distinction between the two internal and external medicines.

If scholars can grasp these two layers of internal and external medicines, the matters of the *Returned Elixir* and the *Great Elixir* will become perfectly clear.

*[Verification: The discussion of internal and external, self and other, is elucidated with utmost clarity. Scholars now know what to pursue! The further compassionate instruction on the two layers of internal and external medicines is especially rare. From here, the stages of practice may be traced step by step. How compassionate! How compassionate!]*

The emergence of this text may yet revive the fortunes of the Daoist lineage—who among scholars will diligently pursue and study it? Alas! What Master Wuyuan has revealed pertains only to the *Lesser Return*, for the secret of the *Greater Return* lies precisely in placing body and mind prior to the *prior-heaven*, drawing them to the primordial unity of the Three Powers, and merging them with the primordial unity of the self. Its essential function hinges upon the two words: *"from nothingness."* For from *wuji* does the One first manifest—yet this is not the *nothingness* cherished by later followers of Śākya. It is the utmost *being* that does not cling to being, thereby attaining the utmost *nothingness*. When obtained and ingested, this *nothingness* is called the Mother of the Myriad Things, the root of the Three Powers. Attaining this singular *nothingness* is the *Greater Return*. Thus did my late master, the Venerable Taixu, expound in his profound discourse, which I record here to supplement what this treatise has not fully disclosed.

**The Lesser and Greater Returned Elixirs**
As the *Awakening to Reality* states: *"The resplendent Golden Elixir forms in a single day."* And an ancient scripture says: *"The Returned Elixir is achieved in an instant, but its nurturing requires ten months."* Alas! Is the Way of the Returned Elixir so easily understood? For there is the *Lesser Returned Elixir* and the *Greater Returned Elixir*. The *Lesser Returned Elixir* is called the *Golden Elixir*, while the *Greater Returned Elixir* is named the *Seven-Return, Nine-Return Golden Liquid Great Elixir*.

The so-called *Lesser Returned Elixir* is the return from *post-heaven* to *prior-heaven*: using *lead* to restrain *mercury*, water to temper fire, the *Golden Duke* to pair with the *Maiden*, the *Black Tiger* to harness the *Red Dragon*, the *Dark Tortoise* to swallow the *Vermilion Bird*; employing the other’s substance to refine one’s own, restoring one’s original essence, reclaiming one’s fundamental truth. This is the Way of the Returned Elixir, hence its name, also called the *Golden Elixir*. As the scripture says: *"When gold returns to its original nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir."* This refers to the *Lesser Returned Elixir*. The term *"lesser"* signifies merely restoring what was lost, recovering one’s original state—like replenishing what was deficient or reclaiming what had departed. Though this elixir is returned, it has not yet undergone the refining fire; if care is not taken for even a moment, there is the risk of losing what was gained. Thus, it is called the *Lesser Return*.

From here, one must apply further effort: re-establishing the furnace, restoring the crucible, and nurturing this Returned Elixir with warmth, allowing it to reach the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, where *truth* descends and the *primordial* arises. Again, one moves the *yin tally* and *yang fire*, gradually withdrawing and adding, proceeding from *nothingness* to *being*, from the subtle to the manifest. After ten months, the embryo is complete, the melon ripens and the stem falls away, and the *Dharma-body* emerges—this is the *Great Elixir*.

As for creating a new heaven and earth, re-establishing the furnace and crucible, where the child begets grandchildren and grandchildren branch forth, becoming a *Perfected One of the Ten Poles and Great Luo*—this transcends the categories of the *Lesser* and *Greater Returned Elixirs*. Yet people today, unaware of the distinction between the *Lesser* and *Greater Returned Elixirs*, speak directly of the *Way of the Golden Elixir*, vainly hoping to achieve success with a word or half-phrase from a master. How foolish! Other heterodox paths are not worth discussing. Even among those who have obtained the true teaching, some know only how to refine the self but not how to gather the medicine; others know how to gather the medicine but not how to establish the furnace and crucible; still others know how to establish the furnace and crucible but not the method of harmonizing. There are those who know only the *Lesser Returned Elixir* and abandon the path halfway, unaware of the *Greater Returned Elixir*. Alas! The beginning is *with effort*, but the end is *without effort*. If one knows the beginning but not the end, achieving the Great Dao will be difficult indeed! Scholars must trace the origin and pursue the culmination, ensuring not a shred of doubt remains.

*[Verification: The discourse emphasizes the establishment of the furnace and crucible, as the ancient sages did. In my humble view, without sufficient worldly resources, even the beginning is difficult—how much more the end? Thus, the Most High, in great compassion, opened the gate of *provisional illusion* to bestow upon the Vinaya lineage: first consolidating the *primordial* to secure the Dharma, then welcoming the One to form the Elixir. How majestic! How free! Compared to what Master Wuyuan has expounded, this is indeed the subtlest and most wondrous path.]*

Yet if worldly resources remain insufficient, few indeed escape sinking into ruin. How much less can one hope for a fortunate encounter without prior cultivation! Thus, I have set forth what I have heard to supplement what this discourse has left incomplete. Yet in tracing the origin and pursuing the culmination, one inevitably invites slander; to ensure scholars remain without doubt is well-nigh impossible.

**On Navigating Fortune and Misfortune**
As the *Wuzhen* states:
*"Fortune and misfortune ever intertwine, like shadow and echo following close behind. Should one master the pivot of life and death, disaster turns to blessing in the turn of a palm."*
And again:
*"One must transmute the gate of death into the gate of life—never cling to the living gate as if it were the gate of death. Only when the mechanism of killing is understood in its reversals does one perceive how harm conceals grace."*

For the Dao of the Golden Elixir, one must first grasp the principles of fortune and misfortune; only then can one advance or retreat with the times, wielding them at will. Otherwise, ignorant of fortune and misfortune, unable to discern right from wrong, one acts recklessly—fire arises from wood, and calamity erupts unchecked, bringing not only no benefit but harm.

**What constitutes fortune and misfortune?**
*Regarding medicinal substances:*
- Just arising is fortune; past its prime is misfortune.
- The southwest is fortune; the northeast is misfortune.
- The spiritless is fortune; the conscious spirit is misfortune.
- Primordial essence and primordial qi are fortune; postnatal essence and qi are misfortune.
- The true body is fortune; the illusory body is misfortune.
- Heavenly nature is fortune; qi-nature is misfortune.
- The Dao-heart is fortune; the human heart is misfortune.

*Regarding gathering and refinement:*
- Water and fire in harmony is fortune; water and fire out of balance is misfortune.
- Metal and wood united is fortune; metal and wood separated is misfortune.
- The primordial transforming the postnatal is fortune; the postnatal plundering the primordial is misfortune.
- Swift or slow, timely action is fortune; gentle simmering or fierce refining, exceeding measure, is misfortune.
- Gathering the abundant to supplement the scant is fortune; forsaking the upright for the perverse is misfortune.
- Seeking life within killing is fortune; harboring killing within life is misfortune.

*Regarding the Returned Elixir:*
- Self and other both present is fortune; self alone without other is misfortune.
- Emotion returning to nature is fortune; nature departing with emotion is misfortune.
- Vital energy arising from righteousness is fortune; righteousness seized by force is misfortune.
- Dragon and tiger unharmed is fortune; spirit and qi scattered and chaotic is misfortune.
- The yang of the other household arriving is fortune; the yin of one’s own household congealing is misfortune.
- Self-stripping and self-renewing is fortune; self-arising and self-defiling is misfortune.
- Kan arriving and Li receiving is fortune; the other arriving and the self unprepared is misfortune.
- Lead restraining mercury is fortune; yin consuming yang is misfortune.
- Medicinal sufficiency with gentle nurturing is fortune; clinging to fullness without cessation is misfortune.

*Regarding the Great Elixir:*
- Tortoise and snake coiled together is fortune; dragon and tiger contending is misfortune.
- Elixir formation in a single moment is fortune; chaos persisting for seven days is misfortune.
- Like-minded companions are fortune; external demonic intrusions are misfortune.
- Guarding against danger and anticipating peril is fortune; water chilling or fire blazing is misfortune.
- Secure sealing and firm containment is fortune; oversight and delayed awareness is misfortune.
- Fetal completion and transformation is fortune; premature emergence before completion is misfortune.

The above encompasses the principles of fortune and misfortune in both the inner and outer elixirs. One must thoroughly penetrate each point and scrutinize every detail before proceeding. Moreover, there are the "Peeling" hexagram’s hard-won fruit, the "Return" hexagram’s calamities, the "Peace" hexagram’s mandate in disarray, the "Stagnation" hexagram’s subsequent joy, the "Decisiveness" hexagram’s voicelessness, the "Encounter" hexagram’s concealed splendor, the "Completion" hexagram’s ultimate chaos, and the "Incompletion" hexagram’s radiant fortune. Within misfortune lies fortune; within fortune lies misfortune. Fortune and misfortune are unfixed, their transformations endless. If one’s understanding is not true, one’s actions will be amiss—an error of a hair’s breadth leads to a divergence of a thousand miles. Yet if one penetrates the workings of fortune and misfortune, perceiving with true knowledge and clear insight, advancing and retreating, hastening and slowing, diminishing and augmenting—all will follow the heart’s intent, each step yielding power.

*[Verification: The discourse is most precise; scholars must not neglect it. Yet there exists an exceedingly simple and wondrous secret: if one can maintain purity and harmony in every thought, one naturally ascends to the Supreme Vehicle. For what Wuyuan discusses still belongs to the methods of earthly immortals—what Master Qiongguan called "a path cumbersome and difficult to accomplish." What I have set forth, however, is the method of heavenly immortals: "taking the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, and wisdom as fire." In examining the firing times, it is simply centeredness and harmony—neither hexagrams nor weights are involved. Wuyuan did not expound this, hence I have supplemented it thus. If scholars can further establish their footing in the prior-to-prior-heaven and govern body and mind with the two words "purity and harmony," they will naturally attain the state of centered harmony, entirely free from flaws. Thus spoke my late teacher, Master Taixu.]*

The Anterior and Posterior Crucible and Cauldron

*Awakening to Reality* states:
*"First take Qian and Kun as crucible and cauldron,
Then gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine.
Once these two are driven into the Yellow Path,
How could the Golden Elixir fail to form?"*
It also says:
*"In the crescent-moon crucible, jade buds arise;
Within the cinnabar cauldron, mercury levels."*
From this, we know that crucible and cauldron are the first essentials of cultivation. Without them, where could the medicine be gathered? Where could the Elixir be refined?

Yet this crucible and cauldron are not external vessels of bronze, iron, clay, or earth, nor are they the crucible and cauldron of chamber-alchemy women. They are the great crucible of the Dao’s creation, the majestic cauldron of its radiance. The ancients took Qian as the crucible and Kun as the cauldron, drawing on Qian’s yang vigor and Kun’s yin compliance. The Qian-crucible and Kun-cauldron are precisely this yang vigor and yin compliance. The so-called "crescent-moon crucible" and "cinnabar cauldron" likewise embody the principle of yin and yang, vigor and compliance. The crescent moon signifies the meaning of yang arising within yin; cinnabar signifies the meaning of yin existing within yang. Only when yang is vigorous and yin compliant, with yin aiding yang and yang aiding yin, do we have the true crucible and cauldron of the Dao. If one abandons these four characters—yin and yang, vigor and compliance—and seeks the crucible and cauldron elsewhere, one strays onto heterodox paths and departs from the true Way.

However, crucibles and cauldrons also differ in kind. There are those for the Returned Elixir and those for the Great Elixir. For the Returned Elixir, Qian and Kun serve as crucible and cauldron, while the Crow and Hare are the medicinal substances. For the Great Elixir, emptiness and nonbeing serve as crucible and cauldron, and the singular qi is the medicinal substance. Such is the distinction between the Returned Elixir and the Great Elixir.

Yet within the Returned Elixir, there is further the Kan-Li crucible and cauldron, which must be distinguished early on. This crucible and cauldron are most critical; without knowing them, even with the Qian-Kun crucible and cauldron, the Golden Elixir cannot readily form. Why? The crescent-moon crucible is where the true fire arises; the cinnabar cauldron is where the true water arises. Knowing this crucible and cauldron, one uses water to aid fire, bringing water and fire into the same chamber. The prior-heaven qi then naturally emerges from emptiness and nonbeing, coalescing into the supreme treasure. Once this treasure is formed, it re-enters the crucible and cauldron of emptiness and nonbeing, where the natural true fire is set in motion. The formless generates form; the insubstantial generates substance. Spirit becomes complete, the sacred embryo is liberated, and even the crucible and cauldron of emptiness and nonbeing are no longer needed.

As for the step beyond, there is yet another crucible and cauldron, which cannot be sought through words.

Alas!
*"Crucibles were never crucibles,
Cauldrons were never cauldrons.
The two words 'body' and 'mind'—
The whole world remains deluded."*

---

Internal and External Firing Times

The ancient immortals said:
*"True fire has no fixed time,
The great medicine is not weighed in ounces."*
*Awakening to Reality* states:
*"Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the firing times, all is in vain.
It all depends on the power of cultivation—
A hair’s breadth off, and no Elixir forms."*
These are all spoken with regard to firing times.

Later practitioners, not grasping the ancients’ intent in their words, either cling to the phrase *"true fire has no fixed time"* and fall into quiescent extinction or lapse into formlessness, or they cling to the line *"without knowing the firing times, all is in vain"* and either doubt the hours of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You, or become confused by the years, months, days, and hours of gathering and refining. Some, perplexed by the apparent contradictions in these sayings, do not investigate deeply.

Alas! The ancients’ words each have their subtle purpose. Though their expressions differ, their meaning is the same. The phrase *"true fire has no fixed time"* means that true fire has no single, fixed moment; when the moment of yang’s arising is encountered, yang is advanced; when the moment of yin’s arising is encountered, yin is withdrawn. It does not mean that fire is constantly active without regard to timing.

The line *"without knowing the firing times, all is in vain"* means that in applying fire, there must be a definite timing. After refining the self and awaiting yang, the moment of yang’s arising is the time to advance fire; the moment of yin’s arising is the time to withdraw yin. It does not refer to rigid, fixed times of the day.

*"No fixed time"* and *"knowing the time"* are one and the same mechanism. Thus *The Mirror of Ingredients* says:
*"Within a single day, the twelve hours—
Wherever intention reaches, all can be done."*
This means that within the twelve hours, there are moments when yin arrives and yang arrives. Anticipate their arrival: when yang arrives, advance yang; when yin arrives, withdraw yin. The arrival of yin and yang are all opportune times for action.

Here the meaning is clear—what need is there for tedious debate? Yet the firing times are not uniform: there are internal firing times and external firing times; there are times for gathering the medicine and times for refining it; times for conjoining the elixir and times for coagulating it; times for warming and nurturing, times for releasing the elixir, and times for ingesting it; times for forming the embryo and times for delivering it; times for cultivating nature and times for cultivating life; times for gentle refinement and times for fierce firing. Though the firing times are many, one must know their precise measures—when to stop, when to proceed, when the process is ripe or tender—adjusting their application to the moment without the slightest error.

Alas! The moon’s fullness depends on oral instruction; the arrival of the midnight hour lies in heart-to-heart transmission. How could the subtleties of firing times be easily grasped? Today’s practitioners, unaware of how exquisitely fine and minute these times are, cling to the ancient saying that “a single word or half a phrase suffices to penetrate the mystery,” and thus claim there is nothing to be said, nothing to be transmitted. Yet they do not realize that the marvel of that single word or half-phrase comes from a true master whispering in the ear, pointing out a single secret of heaven’s mechanism—not from verbal instruction on firing times. Even in a single craft or skill, how many rules and methods exist! How much more so for the great matter of nature and life—how could a word or half a phrase suffice for enlightenment? Let the seeker reflect deeply on this.

[Verification: The instructions here are exceedingly fine, truly the method of earthly immortals. From what I have heard, the crux lies in knowing the time and recognizing the moment. When time is known and the moment recognized, advance and retreat are measured justly, responding with gentleness or force as fitting, never missing the mark. The maintenance and regulation within this process rest with the practitioner. Extinguish movement but not awareness; when the mechanism appears, one naturally awakens. Responding to the moment with balance, one attains harmony. No thought predominates; swiftness lies in an instant’s turn, requiring no effort. Yet if one does not reach true emptiness and stillness but instead drifts into reckless confusion, then the time arrives unnoticed, the mechanism appears unperceived—this is greatly harmful.

If one can focus the will on quiescence, place the mind in emptiness, illuminate without deliberate illumination, and keep the single spirit ever-present, how could one ever lose the time or fail to perceive the mechanism? If this essential method is neglected in favor of other pursuits—even if one thoroughly masters hexagrams, lines, and the like—such intricate and cumbersome details only lead to disorder, making it nearly impossible to avoid the slightest error.

Thus, in the orthodox tradition of the Most High, all else is swept aside, and the sole foundation is to attain emptiness and unity, employing “harmony” and “clarity and harmony” as the means. The Southern School’s Patriarchs Chen and Bai once received verification from the Chan masters Zhong and Lü. Hence, Chen criticized *Awakening to Reality* as “narrow in its application of the mind,” while Bai, in his eulogy for Master Ziyang’s portrait, also offered subtle reproach, referring to it as “tainted with the qi of lead and mercury.”

Yet one must thoroughly ponder their discussions, step by step and stage by stage, grasping the essential meaning. With a tranquil mind, reflect again and again. Then the essential meaning within will be perfectly clear, leaving nothing obscure.]

When emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness becomes profound, with the singular spirit preserving its illumination, then the time’s arrival is surely sensed, and the moment’s arising is surely known. How could the fire-tending and timing fail to meet the standard and conform to the rule?

The essential aim of the Vinaya School is solely to return to the primordial and attain the state of harmony, preserving nothing more than the mind-to-mind transmission. As for claims that a single word or half a phrase constitutes the secret whispered into the ear by a true master—such notions may lead later students into doubt and stray into heterodox paths. Learners should examine this carefully, for it is hardly a sound argument.

Moreover, in my humble view, the Confucian School’s “all-pervading unity” likewise amounts to but a single phrase. This is the sudden illumination of the profound when learning nears completion—a truth of the highest order. Even if whispered into the ear, it must be because the student, seated solemnly before the master, shows obstruction in the dynamics of the mechanism, manifest in countenance and demeanor. The master, recognizing this, offers guidance in a low voice, lest a loud tone startle. Where is there any intent of secret instruction? Students must not misunderstand.

This is a passage of great consequence, and thus I dare not refrain from offering this explanation.

The *Wuzhen pian* states: “Cease all cunning pretense in your efforts; recognize the undying method of the other household.” It also says: “This supreme treasure exists in every household—only fools fail to recognize it in full.” Both passages point to the source from which the primordial medicine arises. Later generations, unaware of the ancients’ secret truth, encounter the phrases “other household” and “every household” and conjecture them to mean women, descending into the arts of chamber alchemy. With callous hearts and depraved conduct, they commit a hundred evils, sinking into the realm of beasts—countless are such cases. How could they know that the primordial qi emerges from emptiness and nothingness? How could it be sought in what is formed and visible?

Man receives the primordial qi, borrowing the essence and blood of mortal parents to take form, and thus the human body already contains this primordial qi. Yet this qi waxes by day and wanes by night; when yang reaches its peak, yin must follow. The yang of Qian Palace flees to Kun Palace, whereupon Qian, now empty, becomes Li, and Kun, now full, becomes Kan. Li means the departure of its yang; Kan means the entrapment of its true essence. Yang, sunken in yin, no longer belongs to me—hence it is called the “other household.” The *Wuzhen pian* says: “To know the source from which the medicine is produced, look only to the southwest as its native land.” The southwest is the direction of Kun, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born anew. Zi Ye says: “The medicine emerges from the southwest, the position of Kun—how could one seek Kun’s position apart from man? Clearly explained, you must remember, lest when you meet it, you fail to recognize it as real.” This person is called the “undying person,” or the “true person.” An ancient immortal said: “If you wish man not to die, you must seek the undying person.” This undying person is the “undying method of the other household.”

“My household” refers to my true yang having departed, so Li is mine; “other household” refers to my true yang trapped by yin, so Kan is the other. The division into Kan and Li gives rise to the names “other” and “self.” These names refer to the state before yang has returned. If yang does return, then the other is the self, and the self is the other—there is only one, with no distinction. The *Huanghe fu* says: “To emulate the procreation of male and female, one must activate the celestial mechanism.” To “emulate” or “leak” the celestial mechanism is to reveal the Daoist method through worldly means—not to speak of male and female, but of the “other” and “self” within the Dao. Later generations, unaware of the ancients’ profound intent in their words, take “other household” to mean an external household and engage in bestial acts, corrupting the teachings. They forfeit even the chance to be reborn as humans—how then can they hope for immortality?

In the alchemical classics, whenever “other” and “self” are mentioned, they refer to yin and yang; whenever “host” and “guest” are mentioned, they refer to operation; whenever “inversion” is mentioned, it refers to attraction and gathering; whenever “being” and “non-being” are mentioned, they refer to movement and stillness; whenever “dragon” and “tiger” are mentioned, they refer to nature and emotion; whenever “lead” and “mercury” are mentioned, they refer to rising and sinking. In essence, all these are nothing more than the two words “yin” and “yang.” In the end, they are nothing more than the two words “nature” and “life,” and in truth, nothing more than the two words “body” and “mind.”

Those wretched sinners of the world, ignorant of the great Dao of sages and worthies, take women as the “other household,” the first menstruation as the supreme treasure, and the plum fruit as the elixir of longevity. This is not cultivating the sagely Dao but slandering it—they shall surely enter the hell of torn-out tongues! Alas! What exists in every household yet does not belong to one’s own household is invisible in its use. If one seeks it, the essentials are method and resources. It must be sought in the “Divine Continent of the Red County,” for what is seen cannot be used. What is used cannot be seen; what is not even present in one’s own body, how can it be used in another? What is not seen within, how can it be sought without? This secret is known only to those who are profoundly versed in yin and yang, deeply understand the workings of creation, and recognize the primordial true unity of qi.

[Verification: Wu Yuanzhi’s teaching directly shatters ten thousand layers of darkness, rendering no small service to the study of the mysterious. Yet regarding the “undying method,” the character *fang* (method) is inseparable from *ren* (person)—this was not made sufficiently explicit. Wu Yuan was a believer in the ancients, and his shortcoming lay in the ancients’ excessive secrecy. As the saying goes: “The intention is not universal; what is revealed is not revealed.” This misled later learners. This is the reason my ancestor Zhang suffered heavenly punishment, though the world mistakenly attributes it to reckless disclosure, leading to his rebuke by the Perfected of Jizu who abide in the world.

A Daoist says: “The *Wuzhen pian*’s ‘undying person method’ corresponds to Damo’s ‘Divine Continent of the Red County’ and the ‘Great Red Heavenly Palace’ in the *Daoist Canon*. Zi Ye’s ‘how could it be apart from man’ refers to the ‘people of the Great Red Heaven,’ hence called the ‘true person.’”

Note: This Heavenly Palace is the original position of the human element. Once the human element is depleted and then restored, it must be sought in this palace. Regarding this palace, if we speak in terms of the body, its location does not depart from the heart and abdomen—thus the texts, Damo’s quest, and all else align perfectly. Moreover, in theory, man bears Qian and treads upon Kun. Kun’s position: in the primordial arrangement, Kun is due north; in the later arrangement, Kun is southwest. The ancients, considering the human element to rely on Kun, thus called it the “undying person of Kun’s direction.”

Further note: The *Falu* also designates Qian as the Gate of Heaven, Gen as the Door of Earth, Xun as the Ghost Road, and Kun as the Human Gate—can learners not awaken to this? This explanation originates from the Vinaya School and is provided to supplement what was not disclosed in this discourse.]

The *Wuzhen Pian* states: "The White Tiger’s *shoujing* is the supreme treasure," and further: "When lead meets the arising of *gui*, swiftly gather it." These all refer to *shoujing* as the primordial True Unity of *qi*. The White Tiger pertains to the west, belonging to *dui* metal. *Shou* signifies the ancestral *qi* of the prior heavens; *jing* signifies the constant Way of its movement. The ancestral *qi* of the prior heavens is concealed within *kan*, trapped by yin *qi* and unable to emerge on its own. The youngest daughter of *dui* possesses the true earth of the Kun Palace, acting in place of the mother to arouse the yang within *kan*, returning it to Kun—thus manifesting the *shoujing*, which is the crescent moon of the third day. It is also called the heart of heaven and earth, the *qi* of the prior heavens, and true lead. As it stirs beneath accumulated yin, moving from extreme stillness to motion, the yang *qi* first revives, becoming the constant path traversed by the ancestral *qi* of the prior heavens—hence the name *shoujing*. When spoken of in terms of its essence, it is *shoujing*; when spoken of in terms of its function, it is "lead meeting the arising of *gui*." Now, lead is kingly water. *Ren* water is clear, while *gui* water is turbid. When *ren* water first arises, it is like dew or pearls—difficult to obtain and easy to lose. The moment its sign appears, one must act swiftly. If there is the slightest delay, *gui* water arises, and kingly water retreats, sinking into the posterior heavens, rendered useless. To gather kingly water is to gather the true *shoujing*. This *jing* arises in the prior heavens and abides in the posterior heavens, giving birth to heaven, earth, and all beings. Following it leads to death; reversing it leads to life. Immortality lies here, and mortality lies here. Originally, immortals and mortals were no different, but when yang reaches its extreme, it generates yin, and the yang within Qian flees to the Kun Palace. The emptiness within Qian becomes *li*, while the fullness within Kun becomes *kan*. The prior-heaven Qian and Kun transform into the posterior-heaven *kan* and *li*, and the true *jing* thus conceals itself. The great cultivator, through method, retrieves this true *jing* within a single *shichen*, refining it into the elixir—called the Golden Elixir. Ingesting and consuming it restores youth and grants immortality. Thus, the Golden Elixir is none other than *shoujing*; before refinement, it is called *shoujing*, and after refinement, it is called the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir and *shoujing* are one and the same, not two distinct things.

Later generations, deluded and failing to grasp the profound intent of the ancestral masters, mistakenly equate *shoujing* with the first menstruation of a fourteen-year-old girl. Alas! *Shoujing* is *shoujing*—not the supremely pure and immaculate *jing* of sages and worthies, but the utterly turbid and filthy *jing* of ordinary mortals. *Jing* means "path," and path is the Way. The character for "Way" (*dao*) is composed of *shou* (head), *chi* (step), and *zhi* (halt). *Chi* and *zhi* represent the *qi* of movement and stillness. The head of *qi*—is this not *shoujing*? Thus, the Way is *shoujing*, and *shoujing* is the Way. This *shoujing* is formless and imageless, soundless and odorless. To describe it is to miss it; to discuss it is to lose it. It cannot be depicted in diagrams but can only be spiritually apprehended—far beyond the *jing* of impure blood. As for the theory of the five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days, this refers to the secret of yin reaching its extreme and prior-heaven yang reviving, not a fixed fourteen years. Fourteen years amount to five thousand and forty days—where do the remaining eight days reside? The number five is the generative number of earth; one thousand and ten are the completed numbers of earth; four is the generative number of metal. Earth pertains to Kun, and metal pertains to *dui*. From *dui* to Kun, yin reaches its extreme and generates yang. In the southwest, companions are found, and the moon appears in the *geng* direction—is this not *shoujing*? The eight days refer to the first quarter moon on the eighth day, when metal and water are evenly balanced, yin and yang harmonized, precisely at the center of the *huangdao*. This is yin generating yang, the *qi* of yang circulating and returning to the central path—is this not the five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days? Moreover, eight days exceed seven by one. Heaven and earth revive after seven days. When yin reaches its extreme and yang is born, seven days pass and eight days mark its circulation, increasing and returning to the central path—this aligns perfectly with the theory of five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days. The eight days also represent the union of three and five. When three and five unite, yang *qi* becomes pure, a single *qi* pervading all, standing centered and unbiased, like the full moon on the fifteenth day, radiant and complete, traversing the center of heaven and earth—this, too, accords with the theory of five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days. The seven-day revival, the eight-day crescent, the union of three and five—all signify the stirring from extreme stillness, the initial movement of yang *qi* upon the head of the path. The ancestral masters’ words are profound and of great significance—how could they be recklessly misconstrued as the first menstruation of a fourteen-year-old girl? As for the first menstruation of a fourteen-year-old girl, this is yang reaching its extreme and generating yin. Blood is yin; when menstrual blood flows, it is the manifestation of yin arising—how could one mistakenly identify this impure and turbid substance as the supremely pure *qi* of the prior heavens? The *Wuzhen Pian* states: "When bamboo is split, it must be mended with bamboo; to hatch a chicken, one must use an egg." The *Cantong Qi* says: "Work is easily done with the same kind; skill is difficult with a different species."

For when our innate prior-heaven endowment is damaged, only our own prior-heaven endowment can repair it—this alone is the true seed of the same kind. When our nature and life are not secure, only our own nature and life can sustain them—this alone is the true seed of the same kind. If one abandons one’s own original substance and seeks another’s, how can that be the true seed of the same kind?

Each person possesses their own nature and life. Another’s nature and life cannot become mine, just as mine cannot become another’s—this principle is self-evident without need for debate. If a man could attain the Dao by obtaining a woman’s first menstruation, why then could a woman not achieve immortality by obtaining a man’s essence? If a man cultivates the Dao by using a woman, then a woman cultivating the Dao must likewise use a man! This principle, too, is self-evident without need for debate.

I urge fellow Dao-seekers to swiftly fill the pit of karmic delusion, urgently open both eyes, distinguish between the deviant and the upright, discern right from wrong, accumulate virtue and establish conduct—thus securing a lasting foundation. How much better than toiling in the city of delusion, groping for bright pearls in a vat of black lacquer!

[Verification: How incisive this refutation! Like an elder magistrate’s final verdict, not a single word can be altered.]

Hang this upon the gates of the kingdom—who would dare utter even a single word of denial? This very essay alone is certain to elevate its author to the leadership of the immortals. Yet pity that in matters of the true seed of one’s kind, his vision remains unopened, his instruction too narrow—one suspects he has not received the full transmission of the Void’s singular work from a true master!

For man stands alongside heaven and earth as one of the Three Powers, all born of the primordial True One. If one of the same kind is allowed to decline, the Three Powers remain a single qi—one in three, three in one. Even if this body’s yang reaches its peak and wanes, the ancient sages said: when bamboo splits, mend it with bamboo. If one does not seek restoration where the Three Powers arise, where else could recovery be found? This principle shines clear: one must hold unwaveringly to the True One, using the One to seek the One, as the mind commands the body. Once the One descends to fill the breach, what difficulty remains in mending the break?

Yet people, in their blindness, drift with the current and chase after trifles, unaware of returning to the root and restoring the origin—thus yin grows while yang diminishes! Since Master Wuyuan has grasped the wondrous meaning of return, why does he not expand his wisdom’s power, morning and night, becoming a model for the world? Let him first test it in his own body: when bodily yin is exhausted, bodily yang becomes pure. If others advance one step, he advances a hundred; if others advance ten, he advances a thousand. From diligence comes ease, from ease comes attainment. Do not seek small gains, do not crave haste. From moments to hours, from hours to days, from days to months, from months to years—what need is there to seek other methods?

Mountains and rivers, the great earth—all are crucibles. The wriggling and the sentient—all are medicinal ingredients.

How to gather? How to congeal? How to refine and temper, warm and nurture, complete and transcend, until one shatters the void into dust? Master Wuyuan has heard these instructions in full! To act as a model for the world—is this not joy itself? Let none say his virtue and conduct are not yet vast, for there remain the Three Numinous Scriptures for Healing the World, which may be practiced in parallel without conflict.

Alas! If even one as self-cultivated as Master Wuyuan has attained such heights in learning and realization, though the cosmos be vast, how many others possess a heart-virtue like his? In the reigns of Qianlong and Jiaqing, how many Perfected Immortals tarried in the world—yet Master Wuyuan did not encounter even one. Not understanding the true, yet not entirely without understanding—let this serve as a humble admonition.

**Refining the Nine Cauldrons**
The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Of old, the sages and worthies embraced the origin and held fast to the true. They refined the Nine Cauldrons, concealing their traces in obscurity."* An ancient immortal also said: *"To refine qi, one does not ingest qi; to ingest qi, one must first refine qi. Ingesting qi does not confer longevity; longevity requires refining qi."* These are essential words from the alchemical classics, yet later generations fail to grasp their meaning.

Those who practice external ingestion use the Nine Cauldrons to refine medicinal substances. Those who craft inner elixirs in the chamber measure nine women to gather qi. Alas! How could the purport of the Nine Cauldrons refer to iron cauldrons or female vessels? To conjecture that it means iron cauldrons or female vessels is to transform the celestial ladder of the patriarchs’ salvation into a passport to the underworld—how lamentable, how grievous!

What is meant by "refining and ingesting"? It is to subdue the primordial qi, filling the abdomen with it—not the consumption of metals, minerals, herbs, or plants. What is meant by the "Nine Cauldrons"? It signifies the nine transformations of the Golden Elixir, the state of pure yang without yin—not the furnace fire exchanging nine cauldrons or the chamber elixir employing nine women.

The primordial qi is invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear, and intangible to the grasp. Like dew, like lightning, it comes without trace and departs without shadow—hard to obtain, easy to lose. The perfected one makes the solid form empty and the tangible form intangible. Gathering years into months, months into days, days into hours...

At this very moment, one seizes the primordial qi of three thousand six hundred years, reverses the seventy-two seasonal nodes at their crucial junctures, and subdues this single point of precelestial true yang. Entering the furnace of creation, it congeals into the sacred embryo—this is called "refining and ingesting." After the embryo is formed, one mobilizes the natural true fire to forge away all residual yin, revealing the original face of Qian’s primal yang. The result is an indestructible substance of adamantine perfection—this is called the "Ninefold Great Elixir," or "refining through the Nine Cauldrons."

This work of the body arises from the midst of emptiness and formlessness, devoid of male or female attributes, untouched by the vessel of mere temperament and flesh. Thus the ancient immortals said: *"The cauldron was never a cauldron; the medicine was never a medicine."* What they called "furnace and cauldron, medicine and substance" are but borrowed images of alchemical firing and refinement, metaphors for the method of cultivating the Golden Elixir—not actual furnaces and cauldrons.

The Golden Elixir is the Supreme Ultimate. Within the Supreme Ultimate resides the One Qi. When the One Qi moves, it generates yang; when still, it generates yin. Movement reaches its extreme and must return to stillness; stillness reaches its extreme and must return to movement. Yang reaches its extreme and must become yin; yin reaches its extreme and must become yang. Yin and yang are mutually rooted. From this arise the Four Images, Five Phases, Eight Trigrams, and the sexagenary cycle—all phenomena and all things emerge here. This is the Dao of creation’s natural unfolding.

Yet if one wishes to fulfill one’s nature and attain destiny, one must seize creation, reverse life and death, invert the Five Phases, and overturn the mechanisms of qi. One returns to the undifferentiated One Qi, restoring the original form of the Supreme Ultimate—how could a tangible furnace or cauldron accomplish this? The so-called "forging and refining of the Golden Elixir" is precisely the aim of perfecting the Supreme Ultimate.

The Supreme Ultimate is a thing of perfect roundness. When roundness reaches its extreme, it must wane. Thus one relies on cultivation to preserve its wholeness. The Supreme Ultimate is inherently without flaw, but through the interplay of yin and yang, it becomes flawed. To preserve the Supreme Ultimate, one must first harmonize yin and yang. When yin and yang blend, the One Qi circulates, restoring the original undifferentiated form of the Supreme Ultimate—this is called "gathering the medicine and refining the elixir."

Because the medicine must merge and transform, the vessel for its fusion is called the "cauldron." Because the medicine must be forged and refined, the instrument of its refinement is called the "furnace." Because the refined result is true and enduring, it is named the "Golden Elixir." Yet in truth, cauldron, furnace, and Golden Elixir are all provisional names and borrowed images, revealing only the ebb and flow of the process. If even names and images are absent, how could there be the filthy practices of female cauldrons, furnaces, and stoves?

Alas!
*"Ever since I grasped the art of longevity,
Year after year I seek a knowing soul by the sea.
Who among them is my true kindred spirit?
I cast these wild words—ponder them well!"*

The Mysterious Pass

The scriptures say:
*"Three thousand six hundred gates of Daoist arts exist,
Each clinging to its own root-sprout.
Yet know this: the subtle aperture of the Mysterious Pass
Lies beyond all three thousand six hundred gates."*

This aperture is the most profound and wondrous gateway—where life and death diverge, where sage and mortal part ways. It has been the secret transmitted from patriarch to patriarch through the ages, not something to be guessed at lightly. Later learners, failing to meet a true master, mistake it for the nostrils, the space between the brows, the fontanel, the Baihui point, the throat, the Jiaji spine, the coccyx, the heart aperture, the Yellow Court, the Cinnabar Field, the Pass of Origin, or the Sea of Qi. All such identifications miss the true Mysterious Pass.

The Mysterious Pass has no form, no image—how could it have a fixed location? It is neither form nor emptiness—how could it occupy a place? To assign it a position or location would reduce it to something with form and image, and it would no longer be the Mysterious Pass. This aperture does not cling to the illusory body, yet neither is it separate from it. Not clinging to the illusory body means it is not any tangible thing; not separate from it means it cannot be sought outside the body. Since it is neither within nor without the body, there must exist something beyond inner and outer—this is the celestial mechanism!

Thus, the ancients dared not commit it to writing, yet neither could they keep it entirely secret. They spoke of it in metaphors: the Gate of Life and Death, the Mysterious Female Portal, the Dragon-Tiger Altar, the Tortoise-Serpent Aperture, the Gate of Wu and Ji, the Pass of Life and Death, the Gate of Punishment and Virtue, the Door of Yin and Yang, the Gate of Myriad Wonders, the Abode of the Inaudible and Invisible, the Land of Immortals and Buddhas, the Aperture of Nature and Life, the Chamber of Original Spirit, the Cavity of Primal Emptiness, the Realm of Thunderous Silence—all these varied names refer to this single aperture.

Master Ziyang said:
*"This aperture is no ordinary cavity,
Formed by the union of Heaven and Earth.
Named the Cavity of Spirit and Qi,
Within it lies the essence of Kan and Li."*

Such words reveal the great celestial mechanism—why then do people fail to recognize it? Now, I, Wu Yuanzi, spare not these two flaps of skin to vividly transmit the patriarchs’ teachings, bringing forth what was unspoken and disclosing what was concealed. Through spiritual resonance and intuitive alignment, I declare to my fellow seekers:

This aperture resembles Penglai’s sacred isle—small without yet vast within, fathomless in depth. It is neither round nor square, where black and white merge, where darkness and light commune. Its gate stands five *zhang* high and four *chi* wide, with two doors—one open, one closed. To the left coils the Azure Dragon, to the right crouches the White Tiger; above soars the Vermilion Bird, below rests the Dark Tortoise.

Dimly, faintly—profound, obscure—within dwells the True Person, named Valley Spirit, styled the Ever-Living Longevity Master. By day he partakes of millet porridge, by night he sips the wine of primordial chaos. At times he sings in pure harmony, at times he seals his lips tight. One exhalation and the aperture’s gate opens; one inhalation and the aperture’s gate closes. Thus the *Daodejing* says: “The Valley Spirit never dies—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.” It is the aperture through which Heaven, Earth, and humanity are born, the homeland where sages, buddhas, and immortals are perfected. Here the furnace is established and the cauldron set; here the medicine is gathered and refined. Here the elixir is formed, here the elixir is released. Here the willed and the effortless converge, where all functions begin and end.

Yet this aperture lies beyond the four great elements, within the realm of stillness and emptiness. It cannot be sought with intent, nor grasped without it. Those who cultivate the Dao must first pursue this aperture, attaining true knowledge and clear vision before they may reach forth to claim Heaven’s treasure. Without knowing this aperture, no matter how diligent the effort or arduous the labor, all remains without progress. Should seekers not exert themselves and strive, devoting their hearts to plumbing its depths?

---

*[Collated Note: By careful examination of the oral transmission—]*
Wu Yuanzi’s insight, though drawn from texts, has never been verified by a true master. His error stems from relying on written descriptions to grasp the aperture, his aim fixed on attaining true knowledge—yet the poison has already taken deep root. The Three Worms within seize the opportunity to weave illusions, conjuring visions of towering gates, resplendent hues, and resonant sounds. Self-taught and self-deluded, he cites texts as proof, trusting in his own certainty to proceed. Little does he know he has already entered the thorny maze, the emerald jar, the demon’s cave!

Had he encountered a true master’s rebuke, commanding him to place his mind before the primordial, to still it further still, preserving only awareness, he would not have fallen into desolation. When the boundless arises—now existent, now nonexistent, now real, now illusory—manifesting and vanishing within, one must meet it with the mechanism of *qi*. Then whatever appears or recedes will naturally return, and one may discern the true and correct within the profound stillness of the mysterious scene. Though it renews moment by moment, shifting in every instant, one remains in tranquil observation, maintaining clarity without disturbance.

Only when emerging from samadhi does one engage in gathering, refining, warming, and nurturing—each stage unfolding naturally, with slight adjustments to prevent imbalance. This is the work that follows the opening of the Mysterious Pass, entered through the secret of “no-thought within thought.” Before its opening, one must simply place body and mind before the primordial, progressing from effort to ease, allowing it to manifest without forced pursuit. The “pursuit” spoken of by the ancients refers to returning to the primordial, without conceptualization intervening. Any such conceptualization in ordinary times will surely give rise to illusory phenomena during practice.

Wu Yuanzi’s affliction stems precisely from his habitual reliance on textual interpretation. Thus, his self-account must not be followed uncritically. To speak of a “pass” or “aperture” is merely to acknowledge this stage—there is no actual pass or aperture. The term *pass* implies obstruction, while *aperture* suggests passage and receptivity. Once rooted before the primordial and deeply immersed in spontaneity, the mysterious state before one *is* the state within the aperture—what need is there for pursuit?

The venerable Master Taixu, along with the Perfected Zhang of Disheveled Hair, the Perfected Li of the Muddy Pellet, the Perfected Huang of Chicken Foot Mountain, and the Perfected Li of Bare Feet, all affirmed in their teachings that the Mysterious Pass opens without fixed location, its scenes without fixed form. If it had a fixed location or form, it could not be called the Mysterious Pass! For this Mysterious Pass encompasses countless eons before and after. Within it, the subtlest principles and states—finer than dust—are complete, responding to touch as swiftly as an echo. Whether one enters depends entirely on the moment of contact; a misstep before or after will fail.

Thus, the ancients’ essential method of cultivation lay in attaining utmost emptiness and profound stillness, then discerning the arising of movement and stillness. If one stirs falsely, the pass will respond falsely—great consequences hinge upon this! How could the mechanism be rashly activated?

The ancients regarded this pass and aperture as encompassing all principles and containing all realms. Yet if practitioners have not purified themselves, or if their purity has not reached spontaneity, they will find it impossible to enter the true state of the Mysterious Pass. Reflecting on this, I sigh with sorrow: “Alas for Wu Yuanzi, who in former times never heard this! The matter is of great consequence—whether one enters or completes the Dao depends entirely on this aperture. How could I not offer this supplement?”

Having thus concluded my account, I drifted into slumber, unaware of where I wandered. At first, stars and moon spanned the sky; then distant mountains emerged like a painting, with a post pavilion nestled by flowing waters. Ascending to gaze, I beheld a vast expanse of calm waves, the moon mirrored in the lake’s heart, and a skiff cutting swiftly toward me. “Will you cross?” I asked—thrice, yet received no answer. Sensing its intent, I removed my sandals and boarded. The boatman said, “Now it is right!” Once aboard, I found it a mighty vessel. Great waves surged, yet the ship, though vast, did not capsize. When the waters stilled, we had already reached the shore.

By then, I stood in the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever: thus, the rising waves did not alarm me, nor did the calmed waters bring delight. The boatman regarded me with approval. We disembarked together, my sandals still upon my feet. I thought nothing of it, yet the boatman nodded deeply and said, “So it is—you truly know the workings of the Mysterious Pass.” With those words, the shore was no longer a shore but a pure abode. Behind it rose sheer cliffs, and below lay a pool. A youth entered from outside, announcing, “A guest has come.” Those who came forth to greet me were none other than Master Wu Yuan, bareheaded in a blue hemp robe, leading a company of four or five—two Daoist priests, three elders, and a man in white—ascending the slope along a bamboo path. At the sight of me, they bowed deeply in reverence; I returned their bow.

Upon rising, I awoke to find all sights and sounds vanished—already the third watch of the night! This is the wondrous principle of responsive resonance, though I know not who the boatman truly was. Here I record this to ponder further.

**Tian’gang’s Workings**
The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Following the Dipper to shake the Light, grasping the balance to fix the primal order."* Zhang Sanfeng says: *"Revolving the Dipper’s handle and pivot-star, forging a crucible of true sun and moon, sweeping away the three thousand six hundred paths."* The Dao of self-cultivation requires understanding the workings of the Dipper’s pivot, only then can one reverse the operations of creation, twist the cosmos, manipulate yin and yang, and avoid being manipulated by them.

The *Tian’gang* is the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, also called *Pojun*, *Yaoguang*, or *Biaoxing*. It is the mighty minister of the North Pole, wielding the scale of life and death, grasping the handle of creation, revolving the Five Phases, propelling the four seasons, generating the myriad things, leading the constellations, and serving as the pivot of qi’s movement. Its duty is weightiest, its merit greatest.

Humans, born of heaven and earth’s upright qi, also possess this *Tian’gang* qi, which governs life and death, holds sway over destiny—its function no different from the Dipper’s pivot above. Those who know this live; those who remain ignorant perish. Yet this pivot-star has both *xiantian* (precelestial) and *houtian* (postcelestial) aspects—this distinction must not be overlooked.

The *houtian* pivot-star courses through the twelve meridians daily, circulating the blood and qi of the entire body. Those who refine the pivot-qi seek to merge human and celestial *gang*, uniting inner and outer as one to repel the hundred evils. Yet in focusing outward, they lose the inward—empty yet not solid, bringing no benefit to others while first harming themselves.

As for the *xiantian* pivot-star, it is intimately bound to the original master, loving and harmonious, ruler and minister of one mind, advancing without conflict. But once the primal yang is broken, the *xiantian* enters the *houtian*, turning its back on the master to seek glory, allying with external foes. At first it guards one’s life, but later it harms it—like a tiger fleeing to dwell in the west, utterly estranged. Why? The pivot-star’s seat is inauspicious, but its pointing is auspicious. If it does not point to me but to another, then vital qi resides in the other while killing qi remains in me. Unceasing killing will topple my very life!

The great cultivator who seeks the deathless method of another does so precisely to obtain the vital qi to which the pivot-star points. The method of obtaining qi never departs from the pivot-star. If the pivot-star sits in my house, vital qi is in another’s; if it sits in another’s, vital qi is in mine. Thus, one must shift the pivot-star to sit in another’s house to achieve creation.

The method of shifting the pivot is not difficult—simply twist the other’s heel, and they will turn around, return home, and recognize their origin. This celestial mechanism is not bound to sound or form, nor does it fall into emptiness. It is not something one possesses, nor is it sought outside the self—utterly complete, luminously clear.

Those in the world encounter it yet fail to recognize it, often letting it slip away before their very eyes. This is what is meant by: *"The position before Pojun—vowed never to be transmitted to others."* Yet "not transmitting to others" does not mean it is truly withheld; rather, one fears that passing it to the unworthy would offend the gods and spirits!

It is not tolerated because this matter is the rarest treasure under heaven. Those who attain it master life and death at will, command their nature and destiny freely—neither heaven nor earth can enslave them, neither yin nor yang can restrain them. Only those of utmost loyalty and filial piety can bear its weight; only those of greatest virtue and power can uphold it. The noble man who obtains it remains steadfast in adversity, while the petty man who gains it treats life lightly. It is not something that any heterodox path can fathom even in part.

Alas! Those who awaken ascend instantly to sagehood; those who remain deluded sink into eternal perdition. *"The golden toad, the jade crow—recognize them truly, and you are a master."* Yet why do so many fail to recognize the pivot-star?

**[Reference Note:]**
This discourse should be revered as a sacred treasure by seekers, for it is the profound and hidden Dao of the celestial spirits. Master Wuyuan’s compassion in revealing it thus moves me beyond measure. Those who know and sincerely practice it will see the Three Corpses vanish of themselves. I have heard of this for forty-nine years! Yet I dared not disclose it before, fearing divine retribution.

Formerly, when Ancestor Lü achieved the Reverted Elixir thrice yet lost it thrice, it was because he had not obtained this one secret. Only after receiving Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingress of the Medicine* and further verifying it with Ancestor Zhong did he dare employ the Pivot-Star. Having secretly received the precepts of the Vinaya School to preserve it through generations, this became the *Mind-to-Mind Transmission of the Supreme*. With this one secret, the ancient sages merely coincided in obscurity. Yet all the world’s learners know only of "turning the light inward"—how could they know this is precisely the secret of twisting the Pivot-Star? As the saying goes, *"The people may be made to follow, but not to understand."* Henceforth, learners shall have their compass! For not only may the Reverted Elixir be congealed, but the self may thereby be perfected.

The late Master Tai Xu said: *"In the study of the Mysteries, step by step free from demonic obstruction—all depends on the secret of twisting the Pivot-Star."* To obtain and embody it is none other than the "turning the light inward" of reflective illumination. The Master has revealed it; thus do I, in turn, rejoice in secret for the sake of learners!

**Execution and Virtue, Life-Taking and Life-Giving**
The *Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: *"When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, stars shift and constellations alter. When Earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land. When Man unleashes his killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth are overturned."* The *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* says: *"Weapons are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the noble man—used only when there is no alternative."* Yet while killing harms life, it may also defend life; while punishment harms virtue, it may also perfect virtue. It all depends on spiritual illumination—it rests with the individual.

From the moment of birth, one inherits the nature of qi and disposition, receives the essence-blood qi of one’s parents, and accumulates the dust of the consciousness through kalpas and the filth of lifelong habits. Throughout the body, yin qi coils and swirls, with only a single point of yang qi hidden in the mountain of form, concealed and unseen. This is what the ancients meant by: *"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—what thing is the yang essence?"*

Though the body is yin, if one has not yet entered the postnatal state, the prenatal still governs, and it cannot do harm. The greatly wise, guarding against danger and foreseeing peril, fortify true yang so that it is not invaded by postnatal yin qi. Thus they directly transcend to the other shore, and the methods of punishment and killing are rendered unnecessary. As the saying goes: *"Laws are made to eliminate abuses; where there are no abuses, laws need not be applied."* This is why punishment and killing are not employed.

But when the prenatal lies hidden and the postnatal takes charge, yin qi surges forth, and the entire body becomes diseased. Some afflictions have already manifested; some have not; some are rooted in past kalpas; some arise in the present kalpa; some originate from Heaven, some from man. A hundred strange forms, ten thousand demonic obstructions—without the method to suppress yin and support yang, to transform the perverse and return to the correct, yin qi will grow daily more vigorous, inevitably consuming all yang, toppling life and destroying the nature. Thus punishment and killing become indispensable.

Punishment and virtue, life-taking and life-giving—these four depend on one another. For punishment perfects virtue, and virtue employs punishment; killing defends life, and life rescues from killing. If one only punishes without cultivating virtue, or kills without giving life, punishment and killing become excessive, inevitably harming harmonious qi. If one only cultivates virtue without punishment, or gives life without killing, then life and virtue lack authority, and external perils will stealthily intrude. Only when life-taking and life-giving are both employed, punishment and virtue both enacted, can one avoid unforeseen calamities and unpredictable anxieties.

Punishment and killing serve to transform yin qi; life-giving and virtue serve to preserve yang qi. When yang qi flourishes, yin qi naturally retreats; when yin qi dissipates, yang qi naturally stabilizes. How could the interplay of life-taking and life-giving, punishment and virtue be a small aid?

For the cultivator who understands the pivot of punishment and virtue, who knows the application of life-taking and life-giving, punishment becomes virtue, killing becomes life; within punishment lies virtue, within killing lies life. Employ punishment to safeguard virtue, employ killing to support life. Responding to adversity with compliance, adjusting to urgency and delay, advancing and retreating—nothing is impossible, nothing is necessary.

**[Reference Note:]**
Punishment and virtue, life-taking and life-giving—these are the indispensable means for gathering, refining, warming, and nurturing to achieve success. The foregoing discussion has already expounded this in detail, yet how to know and how to practice remain unaddressed. For there exists a secret to attaining knowledge and mastery! What is this secret? It lies solely in the four methods of *wielding, sustaining, illuminating, and guarding*. When these four methods are meticulously observed, the signs of opportunity are surely perceived, and one is not deluded by the transformations of qi. Thus punishment and virtue, life-taking and life-giving are aptly applied, and the Dao of the Elixir is perfected. This is the great key to the study of destiny—yet without the purity of the study of nature, few will not find it thorny.

**Higher Virtue and Lower Virtue**

The ancient scriptures state: *"Higher virtue acts without striving, and thus has no need for striving. Lower virtue strives, and thus has purpose in its striving."* They also say: *"Those of higher virtue preserve their form through the Dao; those of lower virtue prolong their lives through techniques."* These all speak to the distinction in the bodily constitution of higher and lower virtue, and thus their practices differ as well.

Those of higher virtue possess an unblemished body replete with virtue—people in whom the Qian yang has not been harmed. "Unblemished" refers not to the unbroken state of the postnatal body, but to the uninjured primordial yang. When the Qian yang is complete, it is pure and perfectly refined, a singular qi undivided, the Five Agents gathered, the Four Images harmonized, every treasure and rare jewel fully present. Without a method to preserve this wholeness, yang will inevitably generate yin as its fullness wanes. Those who recognize this seek the oral instructions of an enlightened teacher without waiting for yin to arise, employing the method of preserving form through the Dao. They mobilize the natural true fire to refine away all the yin qi of the body, using the six yet not being used by them, thereby accomplishing the postnatal work. When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, they attain eternal life without death.

As for those of lower virtue, after yang reaches its peak and yin arises, the primordial has already dispersed, the Five Agents are divided, the Four Images are disharmonious, and all treasures are lost. If one were to cultivate them with the Dao of non-action, it would be like cooking an empty cauldron without seeds—what could water and fire possibly achieve? Thus, they must steal from yin and yang, seize the workings of creation, and return from the postnatal to the primordial. Only then can the original treasures be restored from nothingness, return from absence, and the complete inheritance be reclaimed. Once the original substance is recovered, the foundation of life is secured. Then, establishing a new cauldron and furnace, they practice the Dao of non-action, nurturing the sacred embryo until, after ten months, the qi is full. The dharmakāya emerges, and they converge with those of higher virtue on the same path.

Later generations, not understanding what constitutes higher or lower virtue, have simply declared those who leak essence to be of lower virtue and those whose essence is whole to be of higher virtue—how grievously mistaken! The essence produced through intercourse is a postnatal substance, the grossest of the gross. How can this serve as evidence? As for the notion of "breaking the body at sixteen," it refers to the principle that "at two times eight [sixteen], a full measure of yang gives rise to yin, and with yin’s birth, essence is produced." This is a determination based on yin and yang, not on age. If judged by age alone, some experience essence at sixteen, others before sixteen, and still others after sixteen—what then? Clearly, the distinction between higher and lower virtue does not lie in the postnatal but in the primordial. When the primordial is whole, one is of higher virtue; when it is deficient, one is of lower virtue. This is the definitive principle.

There are also those who, failing to comprehend the great Dao, claim, *"Life is weighty, nature is light,"* or *"Nature is weighty, life is light."* Both are wrong. Nature and life must be cultivated together, and the practice must proceed in two stages. Those of higher virtue do not need to cultivate life before cultivating nature; when nature is perfected, life is perfected as well. Those of lower virtue must first cultivate life and then nature; when life is perfected, nature must also be perfected. The perfection of life is achieved through action; the perfection of nature, through non-action. The Dao of action and non-action is established for the practice of those of higher and lower virtue. Yet when the great Dao is complete, not only is action unnecessary, but even non-action is no longer needed. As for the supreme method beyond this, it possesses its own wondrous function, transcending the categories of action and non-action. If scholars do not understand the distinction between higher and lower virtue yet seek the essence of action and non-action, how can they know true action and true non-action? Without knowing true action and true non-action, not only can nature not be preserved, but life cannot be secured either. The very essence of nature and life is distinguished precisely in the difference between higher and lower virtue. Can scholars afford not to investigate this?

[**Annotation:** The argument is exceedingly precise, rarely expounded by the ancients. Without bodily practice and decades of exhaustive inquiry, one cannot discern it. **Private Note:** Whether essence has leaked or not affects the difficulty of achieving success. When the time arrives and yang arises, and the work reaches the stage of union, an unblemished youth will feel a pervasive tingling throughout the body, with qi ascending. For those who have leaked, the qi easily descends. When it ascends, it transforms into essence or qi, ensuring stability. But if it descends, thoughts turn to mundane desires, and it flows directly to the jade stalk—great danger indeed! This is a matter of utmost urgency; one must swiftly restrain it, guiding it upward through the tailbone to prevent leakage. Yet the human mind is ever-active, and qi is exceedingly responsive. At this stage, if a true youth has merely heard or known of such union, thoughts will naturally turn to the stalk, and qi will immediately flow downward. In my own youth, I leaked three to five times. This is precisely what Wuyuanzi meant by "primordial injury"—the injury occurs at the moment of hearing and knowing, even if the essence has not leaked. The aperture has already opened, and once the work reaches the point where thoughts stir, this transformation occurs immediately. This is simply the natural principle of the celestial mechanism unfolding! Today, youths who do not know this practice are rare indeed. Thus, even youths entering cultivation should, at the moment yang arises, be instructed to direct it backward and upward, employing the method of "sealing the Gen gate." Then, yang will naturally remain in the furnace without reaching the male root, blocking its exit—this is the crucial technique. Once leakage occurs, ensuring it does not happen again is exceedingly difficult! From the age of nine, I entered the Dao, and by eleven, I suffered a great leakage. Later, I nearly became weak, abandoned the practice, and only then preserved my life. Can one not be wary of this?]

Herein I append these supplementary remarks to share with fellow cultivators, for I have further insights regarding distinctions in ancient and modern alchemical texts that remain undiscerned.

My late master, the Venerable Tai Xu, once said: “I heard from the sagely master Ni Wan Shi that the discourse on ‘upper virtue’ and ‘lower virtue’ originates from Laozi, yet the *Cantong Qi*’s citation and that of ancient alchemical classics, though identical in wording, differ in meaning. The ancient classics distinguish them by ‘non-reliance’ and ‘reliance,’ aligning with the higher and lower vehicles. The *Cantong Qi*, however, distinguishes them by ‘non-doing’ and ‘doing,’ pertaining to different stages and functions within the body. The ancient classics’ interpretation closely accords with the *Qingjing Miaojing*. Among the *Cantong Qi*’s traditional commentaries, some attach the terms to temperament, others to stages of learning. My master, the Er Wu Elder of Song Mountain, held that the *Cantong Qi* solely expounds the Dao of elixir-crafting, while its oral instructions—such as ‘upper virtue, lower virtue,’ ‘upper opening, lower opening’—refer to bodily loci, diverging from the *Daodejing*’s original purport.”

The present Xiaogen Shi, having examined Yuan Zi’s distinctions, finds that the *Cantong Qi*’s traditional interpretations all constitute sound doctrine. Later learners would do well to synthesize these perspectives, hence their inclusion here.

**Doing and Non-Doing**
The *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*“At first, with effort, few perceive;
  Only at non-doing do the many recognize.
  Yet seeing non-doing as the essence,
  Who knows effort is the root?”*
This is the method of the entire process of authentic cultivation.

Later practitioners, unaware of what “effort” entails, have proposed myriad interpretations: circulating qi at midnight and noon; revolving the river chariot; heart-kidney communion; Conception and Governor Vessel union; gathering qi behind the brain; qi surging to the crown; regulating breath; refining the essence of intercourse; flying golden crystals from behind the elbows; shaking bones to sway marrow; swallowing the essence of sun and moon; ingesting the qi of clouds and mist; firing the furnace to refine minerals; controlling women to extract chamber elixirs; refining the qi of the celestial stem; or gathering the essence of the five viscera… Such methods number in the hundreds. Though their paths differ, they cling to form as one. To regard these as the ‘Way of doing’ is to miss the mark by a vast margin!

[For reference: Though the various methods refuted above are not the Great Dao, they remain practicable—yet to call them "vastly mistaken" stems from their being "efforts of doing." From what I have heard, even such ancient practices as "firing the furnace" and "controlling women" must never be attempted by those with tender five viscera (who must not ingest minerals) or by those whose physical form has not transcended into a body beyond the body (who will gain no benefit from controlling women). Beyond these two schools, even if the transmitted instructions are not authentic, one must still refrain from testing them upon oneself. Such was the caution in the Master’s posthumous teachings. Wuwuzi rejected them all—his wariness was indeed prudent!]

Yet what is meant by "non-doing"? Some propose guarding the Yellow Court; some, contemplating the fontanel; some, fixing attention on the tip of the nose; some, observing the Hall of Light; some, holding awareness below the navel; some, focusing on the spine’s midpoint; some, gazing into emptiness; some, observing the heart-mind; some, halting thoughts; some, forgetting form; some, silently paying homage to the Celestial Emperor; some, mirroring the body to concentrate spirit; some, imagining the spirit departing its sheath… Such methods number in the thousands. Though their mental foci differ, they all cling to emptiness as one. To regard these as the "Way of non-doing" is to err profoundly!

[For reference: Of the various methods described—apart from the two practices of mirroring the body to concentrate spirit and imagining the spirit departing its sheath, which must not be learned—the rest may serve as introductory teachings on the Dao, but none should be clung to as the Great Way itself. Such was the Master’s posthumous teaching.]

Clinging to emptiness or grasping at forms are all but busying oneself upon this stinking skin-bag, straining the mind upon this sack of filth. How could they know the Way of the sages and worthies, which clings neither to emptiness nor to form, but abides in that which is neither empty nor material?

[For reference: What is said here is correct. If one understands this as employing the provisional to return to the real, then one has entered the true path of cultivation. The learner must awaken to this, lest the author’s earnest intent be in vain.]

What is meant by "having an author" is not forced action or contrivance. Since the primordial endowment lies buried within, and one’s nature and life are not secure, without the method of grafting and the Way of return, how can one prolong life and fulfill the Great Dao? The active practitioner seeks to restore what has departed and reclaim what was originally possessed—this is the art of stealing from yin and yang, seizing the workings of creation, and reversing the course of life and death. It precedes heaven yet does not defy it; it follows heaven yet accords with its timing. Neither spirits nor divinatory stalks can fathom it; how then could ordinary people perceive it? Since it cannot be seen, it is not a matter of clinging to any form.

[For reference: The argument is sound. Yet one must first know that if the three barriers and nine apertures remain blocked, and the blood and qi obstructed, one will be too occupied with curing illness to undertake the distant work of grafting. The various methods shown by the ancient sages were precisely laid out as preparations for cultivating this Great Dao. If pursued for any other end, they become mere tinkering upon the stinking skin-bag—how could they not be rejected?]

The so-called "non-doing" is not the doctrine of withered wood or cold ashes. For when the true seed has not yet been obtained, one must employ methods to pursue and gather it. Once obtained, the original root returns, and one must swiftly secure and seal it, bathing and nurturing it with care, guarding against danger and anticipating risks to preserve this original root, lest it be gained only to be lost again.

[Verification: This argument is most sound. Yet one must know that the loss of the true seed arises from inner disturbance. Having employed methods to gather it, should one not urgently practice such techniques as stilling thoughts and contemplating emptiness? Moreover, inner observation, outer observation, and distant observation derive from the *Classic of Pure Serenity*; as Lü Zu said, "The Great Dao teaches people first to still their thoughts—if thoughts do not cease, all is in vain." How then could the methods of stilling thoughts and contemplating emptiness be rejected? Wu Yuanzi rejects them, but only those who mistake "withered extinction" for the Dao.]

When one attains a body beyond the body, with vast spiritual penetrations and the power of sincere foresight—who does not know this? At first, one seeks what belongs to others; in the end, one preserves what belongs to oneself. Only then does one embody the subtlety of non-doing within doing, beginning with the beginning and ending with the end.

How could those who cling to forms or fixate on emptiness ever glimpse its boundless depths? If a student encounters an enlightened teacher, they should first seek the Way of doing, then the Way of non-doing, and further seek the Way where neither doing nor non-doing is established. Only then can the work of cultivation achieve great clarity and thorough awakening, avoiding the pitfalls of beginning without end or abandoning the path halfway. Students must exert themselves diligently.

[Verification: Having reached this point, students may understand why rejection is necessary! For what they pursue obscures this while ignoring that, hence the censure of "clinging" and "fixation." Wu Yuanzi, though deeply versed in the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, would not impart it lightly. He would first transmit the methods of harmonizing principle and qi, unblocking the barriers, and only afterward proceed to the techniques of pursuit, gathering, and returning to the origin. Once the numinous root is restored, one must by necessity still thoughts, practice contemplation of emptiness, guide the celestial stems in reflection—thus ensuring the restored root is not lost. The profound meaning of secure sealing lies within this; it cannot be attained by clinging to being or non-being. Without rejection, there can be no awakening. This is the苦衷 behind establishing such distinctions. How could students fail to reflect deeply upon it?]

Midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk—ancient scriptures state: *"No need to seek midnight at the edge of the sky; within the body, a yang stirs of itself."* They also say: *"Winter solstice does not reside in midnight, nor dawn and dusk in mere comparison."* Thus, midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk are not fixed to any single time or direction. What they denote as midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk are but provisional names assigned by principle. For when the first yang arises, it is called midnight; when the first yin arises, it is called noon. When yang and yin unite, it is called dawn; when yin and yang unite, it is called dusk. In time, they mark the waxing and waning of yin and yang; in direction, they signify the central equilibrium of yin and yang. Therefore, it is by yin and yang that midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk are determined—not by midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk that yin and yang are defined.

Hence, when yang qi is just stirring, one must swiftly advance the yang fire, lest the yang qi dissipate—this is why it is said: *"At midnight, advance the yang fire."* When yin qi is just stirring, one must swiftly withdraw the yin tally, lest the yin qi grow unchecked—this is why it is said: *"At noon, withdraw the yin tally."* When advancing yang reaches equilibrium, the yang qi becomes harmonious. At this point, one should rest and temper it with yin, lest it become too rigid and restless—this is why it is said: *"At dawn, one should bathe."* When withdrawing yin reaches equilibrium, the yin qi becomes gentle. At this point, one should cease and temper it with yang, lest it become too yielding and weak—this is why it is said: *"At dusk, one should bathe."* As Zhang Sanfeng said: *"At midnight and noon, focus on the fire timing; at dawn and dusk, bathe the golden elixir."* This is precisely the meaning.

Later generations of heterodox and external schools, failing to receive the true transmission, all fixate on the celestial midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk. Some guard the kidneys at midnight, stabilize the mind at noon, and sit in stillness at dawn and dusk; others nurture yang at the winter solstice, suppress yin at the summer solstice, and practice non-action during the second and eighth lunar months. Alas! These are the celestial midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk—what do they have to do with me? Heaven has its own times, and I have mine. Born with the upright qi of heaven and earth, the human body embodies the transformations of heaven and earth, possessing its own yin and yang—why seek yin and yang from heaven and earth? If one seeks yin and yang from heaven and earth, one attains only the postcelestial, formed and manifest yin and yang. How can this restore my primordial, supreme yang qi and transcend the postcelestial yin and yang? Postcelestial yin and yang follow the course of creation, subject to birth and death. If one clings to postcelestial cultivation, one remains within the forging of the Five Phases. When the four great elements dissolve, the solitary spirit struggles to endure—inevitably, it must seek another dwelling elsewhere.

Yet midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk cannot be sought within the body, nor outside it. They must be sought in the realm of emptiness and non-being to find their true locus. For the arising of yang is not the stirring of the body, nor the stirring of the mind, nor the stirring of the kidneys, nor the stirring of the eyes, ears, nose, or tongue—it is the gestation of *Zhen* within *Kun*, the manifestation of the primordial within the postcelestial. The arising of yin is not the dullness of spirit, nor the turbidity of qi, nor the emission of essence, nor the engagement with forms, sounds, scents, tastes, or sensory objects—it is the concealment of *Xun* beneath *Qian*, the sudden advent of the postcelestial within the primordial. When advancing yang returns to the central path, the primordial is half restored; when withdrawing yin returns to the central path, the postcelestial is half dissolved. Advancing the yang fire and withdrawing the yin tally, yin and yang balance each other, neither excessive nor deficient, both aspects complete. Herein lies the Way of heaven and earth’s supreme centrality and uprightness, as well as the sagely Way of holding to the One and maintaining the center. If scholars can thoroughly investigate this point, the subtleties of cultivating the true mystery become clear.

Yet many misconstrue these four times, failing to delve deeply into their essence—how could this be? Alas, what a compassionate instruction this is!

Having traversed the profound mysteries and laid them bare in full, he entrusted them to the carving of pear and jujube. What the ancient sages could not divulge, Master Wu Yuan has now accomplished. For later learners, this calls for burning incense and prostrating in reverence, giving thanks to heaven and earth; adjusting robes and caps, bowing to the void in solemnity; and offering repeated devout gratitude to declare the fortune of those who behold this text.

Alas! The *Yinfu Jing* speaks of "the living zi and wu of heaven and man merging in activation"—has any of the ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures ever revealed this? The celestial immortal precepts of our Vinaya tradition are transmitted orally from mouth to mouth, yet Master Wu Yuan has entrusted them to the carving of pear and jujube. Since their publication, this is nothing short of heaven’s bestowal—the turning of the Daoist lineage’s destiny! How could one who obtains these secrets dare to treat them with arrogance or neglect?

The *Celestial Precepts* state: "Arrogance or neglect toward the true formula severs one’s spiritual root and blocks the mysterious aperture. To transmit without prior warning brings calamity upon nine generations." How could this be taken lightly?

My teacher, the Venerable Tai Xu, said: "If a master speaks and one does not heed, the master bears no fault. Let the receiver stand in awe—take care not to treat it lightly." Since this text rarely discloses its secrets, how dare I not caution those of like aspiration?

Life and death, being and non-being.

The *Book of Changes* states: "In the southwest one gains companions; in the northeast one loses companions." The *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* says: "Life is the root of death; death is the root of life." These all speak of the root of life and death, the aperture of being and non-being. If learners do not grasp this principle, they take the presence of breath as life and its absence as death. Alas! To regard life and death, being and non-being in this way is gravely mistaken. Little do they know that while human life and death do not depart from the qi of breath, their root source does not lie in the qi of breath.

From the moment of birth, one inwardly harbors the prenatal essence, qi, and spirit to nourish the Dharma-body, while outwardly receiving the postnatal essence, qi, and spirit to sustain the illusory body. By the age of sixteen, the postnatal assumes dominance, the prenatal retreats, and following the course of creation, yang qi gradually wanes while yin qi waxes—thus the root of life and death is established. Day by day, year by year, yin qi flourishes as yang qi declines; the upright cannot overcome the perverse. In a single day, there are a thousand births and ten thousand deaths. Suddenly, yang qi is exhausted, yin qi is pure—who then does not return to the great transformation?

As for infants and young children who die before engaging the postnatal, this is simply due to insufficient prenatal endowment: yang qi fails to arise and, over time, naturally dissipates. Only the great cultivator knows the barrier of life and death, understands the aperture of being and non-being. At the moment of receiving qi in the living body, they reverse the course of creation, seize the aperture of yin and yang. They can both bolster yang qi to gradually arise and restrain yin qi to gradually dissolve. Moreover, they enable yang qi to live forever without dying and yin qi to remain dead without reviving. This is what is meant by "seeking life within death" and "generating being from non-being."

The ancient immortals said: "The consciousness-spirit lives and then dies; the original spirit dies and then lives." The *Awakening to Reality* also states: "One must turn the door of death into the door of life; do not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death." This gate of life and door of death do not reside in the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; nor in spirit, soul, qi, or blood; nor in the five viscera or six bowels; nor in the hundred vessels or three fields. Rather, they lie where the four greats do not adhere, in the empty valley of the great void—luminous and clear, manifest and complete. Yet people, unwilling to humble their hearts, are disturbed by worldly affairs, entangled by love and attachment, deluded by wealth and sensuality. Thus, they fail to recognize it when faced with it, passing by the treasure in vain.

If one is truly of this lineage, recognizing this gate and door, steadying their steps: at the place where I am born, they return to the origin; at the place where I die, they revert to the root. Within darkness, they generate light; within the masculine, they embrace the feminine. What difficulty is there in attaining long life without death? Yet what is called "life" is the birth of the true body; what is called "death" is the death of the illusory body. If the illusory body does not die, the true body is hard to liberate; if the true body is not born, the illusory body does not die. Life and death do not coexist; the true and illusory do not share the same path.

This is unlike the heterodox schools, which take the life and death of the illusory body as real and the life and death of the true body as false; which regard the prenatal qi of emptiness and non-being as false and the postnatal qi of breath as real. If learners wish to resolve life and death, they must first exhaust the principle of life and death. Once the principle of life and death is clear, they can attain long life without death, and ultimately, neither life nor death. Only when cultivation reaches the state of neither life nor death is the matter of life and death truly resolved. This is what Zhuangzi meant by "gathering the spirit to attain long life, forgetting the spirit to attain non-life."

When one’s understanding of life and death reaches this point, life and death are equalized, being and non-being are no longer established—the great Dao may be accomplished.

[For reference: When discourse on the Dao reaches this depth, how many in the world truly grasp it? It is not that they do not know, but that they are unwilling to speak of it. My teacher, the Venerable Tai Xu, if he did not discuss it, would remain silent; if he did, he would speak thoroughly. Fearing misguidance of later learners, he dared not remain reticent.]

First and last, Kan and Li—
The scripture states: *"There is something wondrous and strange indeed: the heart and kidneys are not Kan and Li at all."*
This secret may be spoken to those who know, but cannot be conveyed to those who do not.
For the primordial creation of the cosmos is formless and imageless, neither bound to being nor falling into non-being;
formless yet able to generate form, imageless yet able to generate image—how could the heart and kidneys be Kan and Li?

The heart and kidneys are but postnatal entities of form and image, not only failing to be the primordial Kan and Li, but even failing to be the postnatal Kan and Li—they are merely the dregs of postnatal Kan and Li!
The true Kan and Li, when spoken of in terms of water and fire, are Kan as water and Li as fire.
Yet within water lies true yang, and within fire lies true yin—true yin and true yang are the upright and harmonious qi of Qian and Kun.
Thus it is said: *"Kan and Li are the heirs of Qian and Kun."*
Originally, yin and yang were one qi, but when the primordial Taiji divided, yin and yang emerged.
Once yin and yang emerged, Qian and Kun intermingled;
the yang within Qian flowed into the palace of Kun;
the yin within Kun entered the palace of Qian;
Qian, now emptied, became Li, and Kun, now filled, became Kan.
Thus, the primordial Qian and Kun transformed into the postnatal Kan and Li.
Li is so named because it has *departed* from its yang.
Kan is so named because it has *entrapped* its truth.
The Li trigram appears yang externally but is yin within—its yang has lost its substance, so its external yang must be false.
The Kan trigram appears yin externally but is yang within—its yin has entrapped its truth, so its external yin must be false.
Neither yang nor yin is pure; neither is authentic—this is the postnatal Kan and Li.
Yet though their external yin and yang are not true, the yin concealed within yang is true yin, and the yang concealed within yin is true yang.
True yin is hidden within false yang, and true yang is hidden within false yin—this is the primordial Kan and Li concealed within the postnatal.
Neither the primordial nor the postnatal Kan and Li have any relation to the heart and kidneys.
Later learners not only fail to understand the primordial but also fail to grasp the postnatal, mistaking the heart and kidneys for true Kan and Li, or even equating Kan and Li with male and female—how grievously mistaken!

The Kan and Li within a person are like the sun and moon in the heavens.
The sun and moon of the heavens move in their courses, governing the four seasons and nurturing the myriad things.
The Kan and Li within a person, in their activity and stillness, harmonize spirit and qi, sustaining life and nature.
The sun and moon of the heavens have no fixed abode—how could the Kan and Li within a person have a fixed location?
Yet once a person enters the postnatal realm and follows the course of creation,
the false takes charge while the true remains hidden: the primordial is obscured by the postnatal and cannot emerge on its own.
Thus, there is birth and death, and one cannot attain long life without death.

Only the great cultivator knows the primordial Kan and Li and also recognizes the postnatal Kan and Li;
within the postnatal, they return to the primordial, and within the common Dao, they walk the immortal’s path.
They extract the primordial true yang qi from Kan to replenish Li, and draw the primordial true yin qi from Li to return to Kan.
Thus, the postnatal yin and yang of Kan and Li are also transmuted and restored to their truth, once again merging Qian and Kun, uniting yin and yang as one qi—the Taiji perfected.
*"Primordial qi, postnatal qi—those who attain it are ever as if drunk."*

The ancient immortals said: *"A single drop of yang essence is hidden in the mountain of form, not in the heart or kidneys, but within the mysterious pass of the One Aperture."*
Thus, the heart and kidneys hold no yang essence and are not true Kan and Li—this is now clear.

As for the great Dao of the primordial, there is yet another Kan and Li that borrows yin to conceal yang and borrows yang to withdraw yin—a secret beyond the categories of primordial and postnatal.
Alas! To spiritually illuminate this depends on the individual.
How easily can Kan and Li be understood?

[Verification: The discussion is precise. Those who can comprehend and embody its inner workings will leap with understanding, deeply grasping the transmission of the ancients—how could this merely awaken the deaf or open the eyes of the blind?]

Refining the self and laying the foundation...

Lü Zu said: “The sevenfold-returning elixir lies within man, but first one must refine the self and await the proper time.” Master Ziyang said: “If one wishes to complete the ninefold transmutation, one must first refine the self and hold fast to the heart.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “Begin with rectitude, and the end will be well-ordered; without a firm foundation, nothing can be upheld.” Thus, to cultivate the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, one cannot proceed without refining the self and laying the foundation. Yet refining the self and laying the foundation are not two separate matters but one principle. Laying the foundation is not external to refining the self; refining the self is already within the process of laying the foundation. It is not that one first refines the self and then lays the foundation, nor that after laying the foundation one refines the self. What is called “refining the self” refers to the work of practice; what is called “laying the foundation” refers to the consolidation of qi. When the refinement of the self is perfected, the returning elixir may be attained; when the foundation is firmly laid, the chamber of spirit is secure. Are refining the self and laying the foundation trivial matters? Lü Zu refined the elixir three times because his self-refinement was not yet perfected; Master Ziyang encountered wind and thunder at midnight because his foundation was not yet firm. These two masters were the eyes and ears among immortals, the leaders of the teaching lineage—yet even their practice, when incomplete, still fell short of perfection. How much more so for others?

What does it mean to refine the self and lay the foundation? The “self” refers to private desires, to the existence of an “I” and a “self.” The “foundation” is the solid ground, the root. The reason people fail to attain the Dao is because they possess an “I” and a “self.” With the slightest trace of self, selfish thoughts fill the heart, and one cannot stand on solid ground. A hundred demons and obstacles obstruct the numinous chamber; every step is mired in yin, every affair becomes muddled. The six thieves multiply, the seven emotions form factions, the good heart is lost, the true nature is harmed, the original destiny is shaken, spirit grows dull, and qi becomes turbid. Wherever one turns, there is nothing but deluded thoughts and perverse intentions. How can one advance in virtue, cultivate the work, and attain the great Dao? Is it possible? No!

The ancestral masters teach that one must first refine the self and lay the foundation so that one may apply effort on solid ground, ascending from the humble to the lofty, progressing from the shallow to the deep, employing gradual advancement. Since birth, a person’s illusory body carries the qi of the parents’ essence and blood, concealing the yin of the karmic consciousness accumulated over countless kalpas, and is further imbued with the postnatal qi of the five phases. Within and without, it is purely yin, with only a single spark of yang essence hidden and unseen. The upright cannot overcome the perverse; the perverse obscures the upright. If one does not smelt and expel the yin qi within and without, how can the yang essence return? Thus, the work of refining the self and laying the foundation cannot be omitted.

To clarify the essentials of refining the self and laying the foundation: restraining anger and suppressing desires is refining the self; a heart turned to ashes and a will grown cold is refining the self; forgetting emotions and cutting off thoughts is refining the self; neither swayed by wealth and honor nor moved by poverty and lowliness is refining the self; neither coveting fame and profit nor clinging to sounds and sights is refining the self; diminishing the self to benefit others and humbly seeking instruction is refining the self; practicing all virtues and refraining from all evils is refining the self; an unyielding will and vigorous progress is refining the self; a steadfast heart, unwavering even unto death, is refining the self. Consolidating yin essence without harming spirit and qi is laying the foundation; relinquishing the entire body, dissolving self and other into emptiness, is laying the foundation; embracing heaven and earth in one’s heart and embodying the ten thousand things is laying the foundation; remaining incorruptible in seclusion and blameless in darkness is laying the foundation; unafraid of tiger curses and unbowed by power is laying the foundation; unmoved by life and death and unconcerned by illness is laying the foundation.

Refining the self and laying the foundation are inseparable. To refine the self is to lay the foundation; to lay the foundation is to refine the self. In the end, refining the self and laying the foundation are one and the same. If one can refine the self and lay the foundation, when the work is complete, the returning elixir may be formed, and the great elixir may be cultivated. Alas! When laying the foundation, one must employ the bellows and furnace; when refining the self, one must obtain true lead. Are refining the self and laying the foundation easy matters?

[Verification: This passage is the profound law of attaining the Dao. Let the scholar engrave it upon the heart, never ceasing for even a moment. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, silently recite each word in the heart at every moment to maintain steadfastness. Carefully contemplate: “To lay the foundation, use the bellows and furnace; to refine the self, obtain true lead.” How compassionate is this instruction!]

In my humble view, if the Mysterious Pass remains unopened, true practice cannot be grasped. Though celestial lead accumulates like a mountain, without bellows and furnace, it cannot be gathered. It is not that the bellows lack means, but that the furnace must draw it into the treasury. To complete the foundation of the great Dao, one’s work lies solely in vigilant solitude.

The scripture states: “After seven days in primordial chaos, death gives way to rebirth—all depends on companions to regulate water and fire.” It also says: “Entrust your heart to a knowing one, guard and uphold them, and tend the furnace’s fire with care.” Indeed, the cultivation of the great Dao entirely requires responsive companions; only then can one achieve anything. If companions are unsuitable—or if one lacks companions altogether—solitary yin, when set in motion, will surely invite misfortune. How then could one steal yin and yang and seize the workings of creation?

As the saying goes: “When two share one heart, their sharpness can cut metal. When three unite in purpose, they may yet avert peril.” Companions are the reliance of one’s nature and life, the support of virtue and the Dao—throughout the path of cultivation, they must never be forsaken. Yet companions are not all alike: there are internal companions and external companions.

External companions are those of kindred spirit and Daoist fellowship, bound in life and death, aiding each other through trials. They encourage goodness and admonish wrongdoing, harmonizing in intent to mutually benefit and together cultivate the great Dao.

Internal companions reside in the southwest, the direction of Kun—immortal beings. They bear the qi of unyielding resolve, possess bodies of upright integrity, and hold the talent for decisive action. They wield the power of life and death, grasping the handle of existence itself.

They expel evil and uphold the upright, reward goodness and punish wickedness; they turn misfortune into fortune, transform calamity into blessing. Internal demons cannot arise, external demons cannot invade—thus do they guard one’s nature, life, fate, and transformation. In spirit, they are the numinous officials; in the stars, they are the Celestial Stem; in the directions, they are Venus. Great cultivators take these as companions, uniting in heart and intent. Entrusting them with one’s nature and life ensures their preservation; committing to them the work of transformation allows its reversal. They open the Gate of Heaven and close the Door of Earth, keep the Gate of Man open and block the Path of Ghosts. Employing the mechanism of killing to seek the mechanism of life, they invert yin and yang with absolute certainty.

Thus, while external companions may sometimes be dispensable, internal companions are never to be lacking. Should the internal companion be lost even once, one’s nature becomes disordered and life destabilized, the heart deluded and the spirit confused. The primordial is lost, and the acquired arises—one moves from life into death, beset by a hundred demonic obstructions, nothing untouched. Therefore, in Daoist cultivation, forming a companion of like heart is the foremost step. Yet such a companion is the most difficult to recognize.

In its fundamental state, it is formless and imageless, soundless and colorless, without back or front. When it transforms for ill, it becomes a yaksha; when it transforms for good, it becomes bodhi. Its changes are boundless, its appearances and disappearances unfathomable. Most people overlook it face-to-face, unwilling to acknowledge it in earnest—thus do they grow ever more distant, cut off from the self. But if one with a kindred spirit suddenly encounters it and binds it as a companion of like heart, never parting even for a moment, and further gains an external companion to mutually encourage and support, with inner and outer working in concert, both the minor elixir and the great elixir may be accomplished.

Yet while internal companions are indeed difficult to attain, external companions are no easier. Without great merit, great conduct, great fortune, and great karmic affinity, one cannot possess both. Daoist cultivators would sooner forgo external companions than lack internal ones. Internal companions perfect the Dharmakāya; external companions protect the illusory body. The Dharmakāya is weighty, the illusory body light. As Master Changchun said: *“Let illness befall another, let death befall another. At the final moment, hold fast to the Dao and perish.”* Does this not speak to the lightness of the illusory body and the weight of the Dharmakāya? How can scholars remain unaware of this?

Scholars must understand that what the Daoist teachings call the "Great Crimson Heavenly Palace" is what the Buddhist teachings term "Divine Continent of the Crimson Land." The common belief that the Divine Continent of the Crimson Land refers to Bianliang is an unfounded conjecture, not to be taken as authoritative.

My true master, the Yellow Perfected One of Mount Jizu, taught that it belongs to the Wuji within the Taiji. The Wuji has no fixed position, yet the primordial possesses fixed names: Heavenly Origin, Earthly Origin, and Human Origin. We dwell amidst the Three Powers; when form perishes, it returns to earth, and spirit ascends to attach itself to heaven—this is merely because of their having form and appearance. Such is the case in the postcelestial realm.

Yet the life we attain is not this postcelestial form and spirit. Only when the primordial Unity of the One is exhausted do they each return to their kind. Hence the saying that some return to earth and others attach to heaven. If so, when our primordial Unity of the One is deficient or lost, we ought to seek its restoration in the Human Origin. The Human Origin is humanity’s precosmic state, abiding in tranquility within the Wuji. The ancients named this origin the "Human of the Kun Direction" because humans rely on Kun to stand.

Regarding this Human Origin: to say it exists is to affirm its existence, to say it does not is to deny it—movement and stillness, emptiness and reality, life and death are likewise. If one can possess as though not possessing, be without as though not without, act and speak or remain still and silent, and in all things emulate this, one has already merged with the precosmic essence. Proceeding with single-minded resolve to seek its restoration and fulfillment, one attains fulfillment and restoration swiftly, as if echoing a response. Naturally, there will be a spontaneous infusion—this is the wondrous method of exhausting the human Dao, fulfilling one’s aspirations, and accomplishing perfection.

Thus did my true master transmit it orally.

To exhaust the heart and fathom principle, the *Yi* states: "Trace beginnings to return to endings, and thus know the discourse on life and death." Mencius says: "To order beginnings is the work of wisdom; to order endings is the work of sageliness." For the great Dao of sages and worthies has a beginning and an end, a root and a branch. Only by knowing its beginning, illuminating its end, investigating its root, and exhausting its branches can one proceed from start to finish, achieving great clarity and awakening, with every step yielding benefit. If even one matter remains unclear, that matter will be shrouded in delusion; if knowledge is not true, practice will not flow. Scholars must first fathom principle, and only then can they enact it—devoted practice is indispensable, with neither aspect dispensable.

What principle is this? It is the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation. The Dao of creation and transformation has substance and function, a beginning and an end. Within it, yin and yang alternate in operation, waxing and waning in mutual transformation, their changes boundless. Yet its most essential point lies in a single *qi*, and this *qi* is never apart from emptiness and nothingness. This pivotal axis is neither void nor form, neither being nor non-being; it cannot be sought with intent, nor attained without intent; it is indescribable, unportrayable, unthinkable, undiscussable.

Flowing with it, one gives rise to humans and all beings; reversing it, one becomes immortal or Buddha. Within it, *xing* and *ming* reside, and from it life and death emerge. Those who awaken ascend instantly to sagehood; those who remain deluded sink into eternal perdition for ten thousand kalpas. To fathom principle is to fathom this principle. Only by thoroughly penetrating this principle can one enact it. Yet this principle involves timing, effort, adaptation, pace, urgency, restraint, concealment and revelation, square and round, fullness and deficiency, cessation and sufficiency—myriad operations in all.

First, one must clarify the Dao; next, master its methods. Employing both Dao and method, cultivating both *xing* and *ming*—this is the supreme One Vehicle, the path of solid footing. The path of solid footing demands gradual progression, without skipping steps or seeking shortcuts.

What is gradual progression?
1. Accumulating virtue and establishing conduct as the first step,
2. Refining the self and laying the foundation as the second,
3. Using lead to restrain mercury as the third,
4. Lead and mercury merging as the fourth,
5. Nurturing and returning the elixir as the fifth,
6. The great medicine arising as the sixth,
7. Ingesting the golden elixir as the seventh,
8. Congealing the sacred embryo as the eighth,
9. Directing mercury into lead as the ninth,
10. Withdrawing lead and replenishing mercury as the tenth,
11. Guarding against danger and anticipating peril as the eleventh,
12. Completing the embryo and ceasing the fire as the twelfth,
13. Nine years of wall-facing as the thirteenth,
14. Shedding the embryo and releasing the spirit as the fourteenth,
15. Nursing the infant as the fifteenth,
16. Repositioning the furnace and cauldron as the sixteenth,
17. Spirit transforming beyond measure as the seventeenth,
18. Shattering emptiness as the eighteenth.

These are all essential steps of the Dao, the full capacity of sagely practice. If one can discern them clearly, penetrate them thoroughly, proceed with beginning and end, and practice tirelessly, *xing* and *ming* may be fulfilled.

Yet worldly learners mistake the false for the true, unwilling to devote themselves to fathoming principle, dismissing *xing* and *ming*. Before entering the gate, they seek to ascend the hall; before fulfilling human affairs, they crave immortalhood. Expecting others’ true treasures without contributing their own effort, they retreat at the slightest discomfort, abandoning the path midway, blaming it on lack of affinity. With such conduct, how can they draw near the gates of sages and worthies?

The learning of sages and worthies is the study of fathoming principle, exhausting *xing*, and fulfilling *ming*. Its principles are subtle, its meanings profound—beyond the divination of milfoil and tortoise, beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits. It cannot be grasped in a word or half a phrase. Without decades of relentless effort in fathoming principle, one cannot glimpse even a fraction of it. Without accumulating virtue, establishing conduct, and advancing with unyielding courage and single-minded resolve, one cannot move a true teacher.

If a steadfast person treats *xing* and *ming* as the great matter, remaining diligent day and night, delving deeply into subtleties, exhausting the divine and knowing transformation—then, when bitterness ends and sweetness arrives, and fortune’s affinity suddenly appears, all past doubts, tangled and without resolution, will dissolve like melting ice. Only then will they realize their lifelong efforts were not misdirected.

Alas, worldly learners do not ponder what the matter of *xing* and *ming* truly is, nor inquire into what the Dao of *xing* and *ming* entails. They study the Dao in confusion, cultivate the Dao in confusion, vainly hoping to ascend to heaven in a single step or attain sagehood instantly. No wonder they are misled by blind and deluded teachers, spending their lives in the ghostly den.

Consider this: even a single skill or craft in the world requires meticulous, prolonged study to master. How much more so this great matter of life and death, the rarest endeavor under heaven—how could it be easily known?

In the past, my immortal teacher Liuxian initially studied in Shu, traveling between Baishi and Guiqing for over a decade without attaining ultimate realization. Later, in Hannan, he served the Honggou Daoist as his teacher, his resolve growing firmer, his practice more arduous—yet for eight or nine years, he still found no point of understanding. After journeying to Gansu’s Gaolan and Agan Town, he finally met my venerable master. Their karmic affinity aligned, and he at last awakened to the great Dao. Because of his sincerity in learning the Dao and his extraordinary merit and conduct, he wandered the rivers and lakes for over thirty years before catching the fragrant breeze. How foolish are those deluded souls who study for a morning and expect evening results, or learn yesterday and seek attainment today!

I urge fellow seekers to establish an indestructible resolve and cultivate enduring patience.

Banish delusive thoughts, prioritize the matters of inherent nature and life;
Pursue the principles of creation to their utmost, commit with unwavering resolve;
Peel away layer by layer, advancing one stratum at a time;
Only when you strip away to the very marrow of the Dao will you see that every grain of dust on earth is a treasure.
Walk with unforced steps, and every step is the Dao;
Attain great awakening, penetrate past and present;
Press forward without hesitation—how could the matters of inherent nature and life remain unfulfilled, the great Dao unaccomplished?

[Verification:
To study is to exhaust the mind in pursuit of principle, naturally restraining the origin and returning to the end—this is the learning of advancing knowledge and action in tandem.
Knowing resides in the mind, acting in the body; when knowledge and action advance together, body and mind become inseparable—this is what it means to stand on solid ground.
From the very first step, truly embody the return to the original state, and the mysterious pass will open of itself.
Once the mysterious pass opens, the great Dao of the Golden Elixir is restored, free from emptiness and delusion.
Yet the key to opening it lies precisely in the first step of self-restraint.
The method of self-restraint begins with purifying the mind and banishing delusion.
From this, commit with unwavering resolve, peel away layer by layer, until you reach the marrow of the Dao—only then will you know that truth and delusion are originally without form.
When the mind clings to delusion, delusion arises; when it clings to truth, truth appears.
The manifestation of truth and delusion lies in the movement of thought.
Thus the ancients took the point of thought’s movement as the Mysterious Female.
For yang is called "mysterious," yin "female."
The Dao of the Golden Elixir is the cultivation of returning to pure yang.
Yet when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises—there is no principle by which the midst can be free of yin.
The ancients cultivated it by returning everything to truth alone.
Thus, with each day’s birth, return anew, merging all into the One.
This One is indescribable; by force we name it the "Aperture."
Yet what is called "entering the aperture in study" is simply learning to return to the One, lest yang scatter and yin overflow.
Each day’s birth calls for each day’s return—how could learning have a shore?
Thus the ancient immortals said:]

"From the Primordial Heavenly Worthy at the dawn of creation to the present, there is no moment without gathering, no moment without refinement"—this reveals that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy is ever engaged in the work of return, and thus knows no suffering of birth, aging, sickness, or death.

Carefully examined, *Disputations on Cultivating the Real* in its entirety elucidates countless instances where the ancient sages sought to express what lay just beyond articulation, making it a work of profound merit for the Daoist teachings. Yet the omission of a personal account regarding the Mysterious Aperture leaves it incomplete. When perfected, the text would be flawless.

Scholars must understand that within the apertures of the body, true and illusory qi both reside—this is precisely what the *Book of Changes* means by "the Dao consists of one yin and one yang." What the Daoist gate values lies in resonance. True stimulus elicits true response; illusory stimulus elicits illusory response. Resonance follows kind—such is the principle.

Thus, both the self and others possess these true and illusory qi. The ancient sages practiced emptiness and quiescence with the aim of mastering the self to preserve the true. The true source of the supreme Dao lies not in the concealment or manifestation of qi’s mechanism, but in its unfathomable concealment and manifestation. When the heart does not waver and thought does not stir, the true is preserved. With true stimulus meeting true response, the Mysterious Aperture opens. When the true opens, what manifests and what conceals are also true. With concealment and manifestation both true, the gathering, refinement, and return are free from delusion, and the attained effect is likewise true.

This Mysterious Aperture encompasses past above and future below. Within it, truth and delusion each respond according to their kind. As stimulus arises, so does response—no spirit or deity can obstruct it for even a moment. Recognizing this essential subtlety, the ancient sages took mastering the self as the foremost step in attaining mastery of the mysterious learning.

Wu Yuanzi’s selection of this passage to bind the entire work reflects a deep grasp of the ancients’ intent in writing. Scholars must not dismiss the entire book due to a single omission. Wu Yuanzi’s lapse is but one oversight in a thousand considerations of the wise. My emendation here corrects one insight in a thousand considerations of the foolish. Compared to Wu Yuanzi, my learning is as the lesser shaman to the greater—this is my candid word, set down to share with fellow seekers.
