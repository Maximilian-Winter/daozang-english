# 黄帝阴符经注

**Huangdi Yin Fu Jing – Zhang Guo’s Annotations on the Huangdi Yin Fu Jing**
**Chapter Fifteen: Three Caverns Scripture and Teachings Division · Scripture of the Sixth Fast**

**Preface to Knowing the *Yin Fu***

The *Yin Fu* originated with the Yellow Emperor—indeed, the Sage embodied the Heavenly Dao’s subtle workings.

The *Classic* states:
*"He who seizes the mechanism thrives through ten thousand transformations, ascending to kingship;
He who loses it declines through ten thousand transformations, descending to ruin."*

Later, Yi and Lu grasped but its remnants, yet still sufficed to save the living—how much more so the Sage!

Its text is concise; its meaning profound.
The teachings of earlier sages, though many, obscure and reveal each other in turn.
Later scholars struggle to master it; even those who claim mastery are like climbers without a ladder to the heavens.

In recent times, Li Qin falsely attributed his work to sorcerers and demons, composing annotations that merely interweave human affairs, distorting the source.
Though unworthy to peer through the bamboo tube, I dare present my shallow insights.
Thus, the petty may steal a glimpse and presume to grasp Heaven’s mechanism—alas!

I, your humble servant, though foolish, have always believed otherwise.

「Morning I wish to hear of the Dao, evening I die without regret—
I chanced upon *The Obscure Symbols Classic* within the Daoist scriptures,
unknown whose hand crafted it in what age.

Its words and logic are profound and boundless,
as if sealed with the very essence of Nature.

Thus I compiled it, appending my own commentary.
I hope that future virtuous scholars will not lose the Dao’s intent.

**The Obscure Symbols Classic of the Yellow Emperor — Attributed to Zhang Guo**

The Classic states:
*"To observe the Dao of Heaven, to grasp its actions—
this exhausts the art of observation."*

To observe the Dao of Nature, there is nothing to observe.
Yet one does not observe it with the eyes alone,
but with the heart.

The heart is deep and subtle, seeing nothing it cannot perceive,
thus able to illuminate Nature’s essence.
This essence, though profound and subtle, can be discerned—
this is what is meant by **"Obscure"**.

To grasp Nature’s actions, there is nothing to grasp.
Thus one does not grasp them with the hands alone,
but with the **"mechanism"** (*机*).

The mechanism is fluid and adaptable, bound to no fixed thing,
thus able to align with Nature’s principles.
Only that which is fluid and adaptable can align—
this is what is meant by **"Symbol"**.

To illuminate with the heart and align with the mechanism—
thus the meaning of **"Obscure Symbols"** is complete.

Li Qin takes **"Obscure"** as **"darkness"** and **"Symbol"** as **"harmony"**,
placing this text as a preface—
how utterly misguided!

---
**Heaven’s Five "Bandits" — those who see them flourish**

The Five "Bandits" are:
**command** (*命*), **things** (*物*), **timing** (*时*), **achievement** (*功*), and **spirit** (*神*).

The Classic says:
*"The Sage’s wisdom
pursues the grand while neglecting the trivial,
refines the jade yet conceals no flaws.
Thus, when dwelling in peace, they follow the Dao and manifest virtue to transform it;
when facing peril, they employ expedient means and unleash the mechanism to save it.
Their aim is to rectify Heaven and Earth,
their strategy to benefit all humanity.
Hence, they use great righteousness to eliminate the world’s calamities,
great benevolence to promote the world’s benefits,
ultimate justice to redress its wrongs,
and absolute fairness to curb its selfishness—
thus, their plans that invert the scriptures yet harmonize with the Dao
are named in five ways; the Sage transcends them,
and so they are called **"Bandits"**.
Yet the world relies upon them,
and so they are called **"virtue/power"** (*德*).

Thus:
**The Bandit of command** (*贼天之命*), though seen as Heaven’s will,
the people do not recognize it as a Bandit—
this is why the Yellow Emperor succeeded the Yan Emperor.

**The Bandit of things** (*贼天之物*), though seen as Heaven’s will,
the people do not recognize it as a Bandit—
this is why Yao succeeded the Zhi Emperor.

**The Bandit of timing** (*贼天之时*), though seen as Heaven’s will,
the people do not recognize it as a Bandit—
this is why Shun succeeded Yao.

**The Bandit of achievement** (*贼天之功*), though seen as Heaven’s will,
the people do not recognize it as a Bandit—
this is why Great Yu succeeded Shun.

**The Bandit of spirit** (*贼天之神*), though seen as Heaven’s will,
the people do not recognize it as a Bandit—
this is why Tang of the Shang overthrew the Xia mandate,
and King Wu of the Zhou overthrew the Shang mandate.

Thus, those who perceive them prosper—
prosperity comes naturally.

The Duke of Zhou likened the Bandits to **"the five flavors"** (*五味*), using them as a metaphor.
Li Qin fails to comprehend,
misinterpreting the Yellow Emperor’s Bandit of command as the **"seduction of a maiden"** (*少女之命*), and the **"midday ascent"** (*白日上腾*) as unnatural.

---
**The Five Bandits lie within the heart, their execution in Heaven;
The universe lies within the hands, ten thousand transformations arise from the body.**

The Classic says:
*"The establishment of virtue is clear,
the employment of mechanism is subtle—
unleashed within, revealed without—
this is all."*

How could one brandish arms and wage raids for chaos?
To see the mechanism and grasp it,
though the universe be vast,
it does not depart from the span of one’s hands—
what of lesser things?

To know the spirit and embody it,
though myriad things abound,
they cannot escape one’s understanding—
what of fewer things?

Nature’s creative force is mine—
is this not magnificent?
Is this not grand?

Li Qin and his ilk take the Five Bandits as the five flavors,
claiming that following them leads to immortality and Daoist transcendence—
how they pervert the Dao most grievously!

---
**Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism.
The Dao of Heaven establishes humanity.**

The Classic says:
*"Humanity is Heaven’s nature, the mechanism is humanity’s heart.
Humanity’s nature is inherently aligned with the subtle and profound—
thus the Sage can embody the Five Bandits."*

When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism,
dragons and serpents rise from the land;
when humanity unleashes the killing mechanism,
Heaven and Earth invert.

The Classic says:
*"Heaven’s mechanism expands yet does not create life,
Heaven’s mechanism relaxes yet does not cause death.
Heaven has expansion and relaxation,
its use has both affirmation and negation.
When expanded, the killing威 is unleashed;
when relaxed, the killing威 ceases.
Humanity’s mechanism is likewise so.

Heaven wields *qi* as its威,
humanity wields *virtue/power* (*德*) as its mechanism.
In autumn and winter, the yin *qi* is stern and congealed—
this is Heaven’s expanded killing mechanism,
so dragons and serpents fear it and hide in hibernation.
When winter yields to spring, yin recedes and yang grows—
this is Heaven’s relaxed killing mechanism,
so dragons and serpents rejoice and awaken.

Heaven has cold and warmth,
virtue/power likewise has cold and warmth.
When virtue/power and punishment are strict and orderly,
this is the ruler’s expanded killing mechanism,
so the lowly fear it and submit.
When virtue/power falters and punishment becomes partial,
this is the ruler’s relaxed killing mechanism,
so the wicked rejoice and run wild.

Rank has its high and low,
mirroring Heaven and Earth,
thus it is said:
*'When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism,
dragons and serpents rise from the land,
and banditry and chaos take root;
when humanity unleashes the killing mechanism,
Heaven and Earth invert,
and high and low are thus overturned.'*

The Duke of Zhou, Zhuge Liang, and others
take the slaughter of ten thousand men,
great winds and storms,
and the sun obscured at midday,
as signs of Heaven and Earth inverting—
how mistaken they are!

---
**Heaven and humanity unite in virtue/power (*德*), ten thousand transformations rest upon their foundation.**

The Classic says:
*"Heaven moves the mechanism of calamity and blessing above,
the ruler shifts the mechanism of benefit and harm below—
thus, those with virtue/power flourish through ten thousand transformations,
reaching the heights of kingship;
those without virtue/power decline through ten thousand transformations,
falling to ruin.

Hence, it is said:
*'Heaven and humanity unite in virtue/power,
ten thousand transformations rest upon their foundation.'*
This is the natural order.

---
**Nature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed.**

The Classic says:
*"The Sage’s nature
is skilled in applying wisdom,
clumsy in applying force.
When in poverty or peril,
they plot the Dao to deliver it;
when confronting the strong or the clever,
they conceal righteousness to retreat.
This is the way to govern a state,
and likewise the way to employ troops."*

The nine orifices’ malice
lies in the three essentials—
they govern motion and stillness.

The Classic says:
*"The nine orifices’ functions
rest upon the three essentials as their mechanism.
The three essentials are: **mechanism (機)**, **emotion (情)**, and **nature (性)**.
To **mechanize (機之)** is to ensure nothing remains unsettled;
to **emotionally sway (情之)** is to ensure nothing remains uncorrupted;
to **align with nature (性之)** is to ensure nothing remains unrectified.
Thus, the Sage moves to suppress their emotions,
remains still to preserve their nature,
and finds joy to steady their mechanism.
The petty man does the opposite—
hence the later passage:
*‘Duke Zhou established the three essentials as ear, eye, and mouth;
Li Qin took them as heart, spirit, and will—all forgetting the mechanism.’
Both lost the true intent of the *Yin Symbol*.

Fire arises from wood—
when calamity strikes, it must conquer;
treachery arises in the state—
when stirred, it must collapse.
To know and refine this is called the Sage.

The Classic says:
*‘Wood’s nature is stillness;
when moved, it generates fire.
Unaware, the fire grows fierce,
and consumes its own substance.
So too, humanity’s nature is stillness;
when moved, it generates treachery.
Unaware, treachery takes root,
and disrupts the state.’

The enlightened perceive others’ vulnerabilities to set their mechanisms;
the wise discern others’ flaws to exploit their advantages—
thus, while the world calls them foolish,
they attain the Dao’s principle.

Hence, the living believe they’ve secured their lives,
the dead believe they’ve secured their deaths—
non-action yet nothing remains undone:
this is the Dao’s logic.

Heaven’s birth and death are the Dao’s logic.
Heaven and Earth are thieves of the ten thousand things;
the ten thousand things are thieves of humanity;
humanity is thief of the ten thousand things.
When the three thefts are just,
the Three Powers rest in harmony.

The Classic says:
*‘Heaven and Earth transform through yin-yang qi into the ten thousand things,
yet the things remain unaware of their theft.
The ten thousand things nourish humanity with flavors of good and evil,
yet humanity remains unaware of their theft.
Humanity governs the ten thousand things through schemes of benefit and harm,
yet the things remain unaware of their theft.
The three thefts harmonize mysteriously within the human heart,
the Three Powers align in stillness with Heaven’s principle.

To eat when the time is right—
a lifetime of unending benefit;
to act when the mechanism is ripe—
all creatures rest in ease.
To eat out of season, to act without mechanism—
nearly invites annihilation.
Thus it is said:
*‘To eat in season, the hundred limbs flourish;
to act in mechanism, the ten thousand transformations are at ease.’

Humanity knows its spirit as spirit,
yet does not know why the spirit is spirit.

The Classic says:
*‘Common folk do not recognize theft as theft,
only attributing it to the spirit’s power.
The *Ghost Valley Classic* says:
*‘When neither party is aware, it is called spirit.’
This is the function of subtle action realized.

Li Qin did not grasp this passage’s unity with the three thefts,
instead contrasting the Sage and the foolish—
how greatly he erred!

The sun and moon follow their numbers,
great and small have their fixed roles—
thus the Sage’s deeds manifest,
and divine clarity emerges.

The Classic says:
*‘The sun and moon follow their measures—
this is their appointed motion;
great and small have their fixed roles—
this is the hierarchy of ruler and subject.
To observe Heaven’s timing,
to scrutinize human affairs,
to seize humanity’s mechanisms—
thus the Sage attains deeds,
and divine clarity is revealed.
When the heart aligns with principle,
this is the ultimate good.

Li Qin took celestial cycles as the sun and moon,
and residual fractions as great and small,
claiming spirit-qi could generate the Sage’s deeds and divine clarity—
his errors are extreme.

Their theft of mechanisms
no one in the world can see or know.
The noble who attains it safeguards their life;
the petty who attain it risk their fate.

The Classic says:
*‘Their theft is subtle in motion,
yet its application is vast and clear,
its execution profound and mysterious.
The noble uses it—
in prosperity, they benefit all under Heaven—
Duke Zhou is such a one.
In adversity, they perfect themselves—
Confucius is such a one.
Is this not discernment in choosing advantage?

The petty use it—
confused by reputation, they lose themselves—
is this not the case of Lord Zhen?
To gain advantage while losing virtue—
is this not the case of Li Si?
Is this not failing to uphold the Dao with sincerity?

The blind excel in hearing,
the deaf excel in sight.
To sever the single source of advantage,
to employ troops tenfold.
To repeat day and night threefold,
to employ troops ten thousandfold.

The Classic says:
*‘The blind excel in hearing,
forgetting color to discern sound—
thus their acuity is sharpened.
The deaf excel in sight,
abandoning hearing to focus on vision—
thus their clarity is heightened.
Hence they achieve the work of ten men.
To act three times in a single day—
this is how they reach their goal.
To reflect three times in a single night—
this is how they refine their precision.
Thus they can command ten thousand men.

Li Qin did not know *troops* refers to the multitude,
mistaking it for *military strategy*—
a grave error.

The heart is born from things,
dies from things,
and its mechanism lies in the eyes.

The Classic says:
*‘The heart harbors emotions of love and hatred;
things possess utility or ruin.
The eyes observe them externally,
the heart responds and judges internally.
If good, they act in accordance;
if not, they refrain—
thus encouraging virtue and punishing vice.

Li Qin took Item羽’s failure to perceive the mechanism as the heart born from things,
and Shí Huán’s perception as the heart dying from things—
yet he failed to recognize utility and ruin.

Heaven’s ultimate selfishness
generates its ultimate public benefit.

The Classic says:
*‘Natural principle is subtle and unknowable—
this is the height of selfishness.’*

The **Dao/Way**’s natural function is manifest yet unassailable—
the height of public benefit.

The sage embodies it thusly.

Li Qin cites *The Art of War* (《孙子》):
*"Love your soldiers as you love your own children,
and they will follow you to death."*

Why so? The **mechanism** of capture lies in **qi** (氣).
*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"Capture things with **qi** (氣),
control them with **mechanism** (機)—
what need of brute force?"*

The **Great Marshal** (太公) asks:
*"Would one use brute force to dominate?"*

Li Qin fails to grasp the **mechanism** of capture,
mistaking it for the **Dao/Way** of beasts.
His annotations cite such as:
turtles devouring serpents,
yellow-bellied beasts consuming tigers—
how tragic!

The living are the root of death,
the dead are the root of life.

**Virtue/power** (恩) arises from harm,
harm arises from **virtue/power**.

The living are what people love,
for they are thick upon the body.
Excess leads to the loss of the **Dao/Way**,
and death comes naturally.

The dead are what people hate,
for they harm one’s affairs.
When the **Dao/Way** is most clear,
life is naturally preserved.

Where **virtue/power** (福) reaches,
that is called **virtue/power** (恩);
where calamity strikes,
that is called harm.

If one is harmed,
it benefits others—
thus harm generates **virtue/power**.

Li Qin cites *The Art of War*’s use of arms as life and death,
and **Great Marshal** (丁公) and **Master Guan** (管仲) as examples of **virtue/power** and harm—
how strange!

Fools call Heaven and Earth’s patterns **virtue/power** (恩),
I call the **Dao/Way** of time and things profound.

Others see folly in my **Dao/Way**,
I see wisdom in not foreseeing.

Others await its coming,
I await its coming with wisdom—
*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"Observe Heaven’s movement through the four seasons,
perceive Earth’s transformation in all things—
knowing all yet veiling it with ignorance,
a small **virtue/power** toward others,
to nurture oneself in deception."*

To know the seasons’ progression,
to know all things’ birth—
these are natural.

Thus the sage abides in the **Dao/Way**’s balance,
*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"Therefore, it is said: ‘Life and death lie within me alone.’*

A person’s death and life
are like drowning in water or burning in fire—
self-destruction.

To govern a state with the **Dao/Way**,
lies in diminishing its affairs alone.

To command an army with **authority** (權),
lies in annihilating its soldiers alone.

Thus, without the **mechanism** of death,
one does not die—
what concern are ghosts and spirits to me?

The sage cultivates the self to secure one’s family,
governs the state to pacify the world—
in establishing the **mechanism** of life.

To remove one’s own **mechanism** of death,
that is the **mechanism** of life.

To eliminate the **mechanism** of death
and take its **virtue/power** (情) of life—
that is the **mechanism** of death.

Li Qin fails to comprehend Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
and verifies it through fools, sages, and those who embody it yet remain ignorant—
his error is grave.

Thus it is said:
*"Drowning in water, burning in fire—
self-destruction,"*
as noted above.

The **Dao/Way** of ultimate stillness is natural,
thus Heaven and Earth, all things, are born.

*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"The **Dao/Way** of nature—
effortless yet nothing is left undone.
Motion and stillness both attain their essence,
the height of stillness."*

Stillness thus establishes Heaven and Earth,
generates all things—
naturally so.

**Master Yi** (伊尹) says:
*"In ultimate stillness,
one does not know how life arises."*

Heaven and Earth’s **Dao/Way** is subtle,
thus **yin** and **yang** prevail.

*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"Subtle, like a gradual permeation.
Heaven and Earth’s **Dao/Way**,
embodied yet applied subtly—
all transformations return to the proper order,
the gradual essence of subtlety."*

Thus subtlety permeates,
dividing **yin** and **yang**,
completing the four seasons—
the ultimate of firmness and compliance.

**Yin** and **yang** interact,
and their transformations proceed in compliance.

*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"The sage follows **yin** and **yang**’s **mechanism** (機).
Heaven and Earth’s positions are natural,
thus one follows them in mystery,
uses them in accordance—
all attain the **Dao/Way** of nature."*

Therefore, the sage knows
the **Dao/Way** of nature cannot be defied,
and follows it accordingly—
as noted above.

The **Dao/Way** of ultimate stillness,
even **laws** (律) and **calendars** (历) cannot fully grasp—
*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"In the **Dao/Way**’s ultimate stillness,
**laws** and **calendars** are applied yet cannot conform—
this is like beasts and birds."*

Hence there are wondrous tools,
generating all phenomena.

The **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) and **Celestial Stems** (甲子) hold
divine **mechanism** (機) and hidden **Dao/Way** (藏).

*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"The **Eight Trigrams**’s shifting arts,
from this arise.
Above, all phenomena;
below, all **mechanisms** (機).

Using the **Eight Trigrams** to embody Heaven,
using the **Nine Categories** (九畴) to model Earth.
Combining with **climate** (氣候),
threading with **Celestial Stems** (甲子),
reaching through **divine mechanism** (神機),
concealing with **deceptive storage** (诡藏),
the wondrous and cunning surging naturally."*

The **mechanism** of **yin** and **yang**’s mutual conquest
is clearly manifest in the **phenomena** (象).

*The Classic* (《传》) says:
*"The **mechanism** of **yin** and **yang**’s mutual conquest—
constantly subtle yet never defying its root,
its clarity is trustworthy and clear,
thus it can penetrate the **precise** (精) and **illuminating** (曜) **phenomena**."*

**Annotations on the *Heavenly Mechanism Classic* (《阴符》):**
The preface says:
*"If there is **mechanism** yet no sage to wield it, it fails;
if there is a sage yet no **Dao/Way** to guide him, it fails.
Thus *The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
‘Spotting the stag, without alarm—
only entering the forest.
The noble one almost does not hunt it,
for he regrets the effort.’
Thus the sage observes the times and uses their **Dao/Way** (符),
responds to **mechanism** and controls the matter—
thus he can wield life and death in his grasp,
achieve success across the world."*

*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"The noble one stores wondrous tools within himself,
waiting for the time to act."*

Therefore, the sage preserves them in the **spiritual platform** (灵台),
to observe **mechanism** and change.

When coiled, they conquer themselves;
when unfurled, they conquer others.
When examined, they are formless;
when applied, they reach their limits.

*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"**Yin** and **yang**’s unfathomable essence—
this is called **divine** (神)."*
And the *Heavenly Mechanism Classic* (《阴符》) embodies it.

Thus the sage’s unfathomable **Dao/Way** (符),
molds the world without blame.

Heaven is Earth’s sovereign,
the **Dao/Way** is the **virtue/power** (德) of the ruler—
thus the sage honors Earth and models Heaven,
establishes **virtue/power** and practices the **Dao/Way**.

He raises Heaven’s **Dao/Way** as the first principle,
and clarifies Earth to honor it.

*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"Thus one complies with Heaven,
waiting for the time to act."*

Therefore, when the sage would act,
he must first observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**’s fullness and emptiness,
then execute accordingly.

「When undertaking actions in accordance with circumstances,
there will be no wasted strategies.
*The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"Follow Earth’s **Dao/Way** while honoring Heaven’s **virtue/power** (時)."*

△昌知
The sage models Earth and honors Heaven,
establishes **virtue/power** and practices the **Dao/Way**.
He who dwells between Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and Earth’s **virtue/power**,
and constructs the most magnificent achievements,
has never failed to succeed through the **Five Bandits** (五賊).
The **Five Bandits** (五賊) are:
the first bandit steals life,
the second bandit plunders wealth,
the third bandit seizes opportunity,
the fourth bandit undermines merit,
the fifth bandit assaults **divine** (神) authority—
the **Dao/Way** of the **August Emperor** (皇), **Sage-King** (王), **Conqueror** (霸), and **Opportunist** (權變).
Thus the sage observes circumstances and responds to them,
measures time and acts accordingly.
Hence, **Duke Zhou** (太公) established the **Conqueror’s Code** (霸典) and extinguished the **Xia Dynasty** (殷朝),
enacted the **King’s Wind** (王風) and restored order to the **Zhou Dynasty** (周室).
Was this not following the times and circumstances,
and wielding the **Five Bandits**?

Therefore, the sage establishes his foundation among the **August Emperor** (皇) and **Sage-King** (王),
and adapts to circumstances within the **Conqueror’s Code** (權霸).
In governing a state and cultivating oneself,
if the **Five Bandits** are fully deployed,
then the world will follow in awe,
exhausting their lives without blame or resentment.
Hence it is said:
*"The **Dao/Way** of bandits,
the **virtue/power** of invisible armies."*
Ah! No greater thieves exist.
With the **Five Bandits** in mind,
and their control in hand,
there is no finer art in cultivating oneself and assisting the world.
As the text says:
*"Those who perceive it prosper,"*
is this not fitting?

△身知
The **Art of the Body** (術) states:
*"In man, the heart is the sovereign,
the palace of the **spirit** (魂),
and the repository of the **vital essence** (魄)."*
When one would execute the **Five Bandits**,
the heart is the most crucial.
If one plots with intent,
it must align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**.
Then, though the universe be vast,
one surveys it all within the palm of one’s hand;
though myriad things exist,
life and death never stray from the **Art’s** grasp.
Thus, Heaven and Earth are not too distant or too grand
to behold—how much less so
the sights and sounds before one’s eyes?

△機知
The **Dao/Way** of killing is the seed of two dynasties’ rise and fall,
and the portent of ten thousand lives’ fate.
In the days when clouds and thunder have not yet settled,
when the **play of yin-yang** (玄黃) flows like blood,
Heaven’s transformations unfold—
the **Dragon** (龍) emerges from the fields,
the **Serpent** (蛇) slithers upon the paths.
This is the **Dao/Way** of war,
hence it is called **"Dragon and Serpent Stirring the Earth"** (龍蛇起陸).
When man’s **Dao/Way** shifts,
spring commands autumn’s orders,
rewards are given to the disloyal,
punishments to the faithful—
this is the **Dao/Way** of chaos,
hence it is called **"Heaven and Earth in Reverse"** (天地反覆).
When Heaven’s and man’s **Dao/Way** of change arise simultaneously,
though myriad transformations occur,
the **Dao/Way** of success and failure is already determined.

△藏古
The benevolent must have courage,
yet the courageous are not necessarily benevolent;
the wise can feign foolishness,
yet the foolish are not necessarily wise.
Thus the sage, when his timing is right,
sees cleverness and accomplishes great deeds;
when his timing is wrong,
sees clumsiness and obscures his traces.
Hence **Zhuge Liang** (孔明) in his *Preface* (《序》) says:
*"Duke Zhou was eighty years old,
not because he did not encounter the right moment,
but because he discerned his master’s **virtue/power**."*
Ah! At the moment when life and death hinge upon cleverness or clumsiness,
and one recognizes the **Dao/Way** of retreat and concealment,
one can observe changes, perceive circumstances,
and wield the **Five Bandits**.

This is how it is:
The sage’s **Dao/Way** is to penetrate deeply and gaze far,
to act without missing a moment,
observing Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and measuring man’s fate,
responding to the times.
Thus *The Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"Who knows advancement and retreat,
survival and extinction,
yet never strays from the **Dao/Way**?
Only the sage!"*

△靜主
The **Nine Orifices** (九竅) are in Heaven the **Nine Stars** (九星),
on Earth the **Nine Regions** (九州),
and in man the **Nine Orifices**.
When the **Nine Orifices**’ **qi** is unbalanced,
it is called **"receiving evil"** (受邪).
To receive evil is to have one’s discernment and actions skewed;
when discernment and actions are skewed,
one cannot perceive circumstances or observe changes.
Thus the urgency of the **Nine Orifices**
lies in the **Three Essentials** (三要).
**Duke Zhou** (太公) said:
*"Ears, eyes, and mouth."*
Ears, eyes, and mouth are the heart’s assistants;
they are the **spirit**’s (神) gateways;
they are the pivot of wisdom;
they are the source of fortune and calamity.
Thus, ears without acuity cannot distinguish sounds,
eyes without clarity cannot perceive circumstances,
and a mouth without restraint cannot issue commands.
If the **Three Essentials** are not refined,
one cannot govern a state above,
nor manage a household below—
how much less can one command armies?
To suspend the lives of men,
to determine the fate of nations,
between stillness and motion,
one cannot act without purpose—
how can one treat them lightly and employ them?"*

△人齋
Fire is born from wood,
yet fire erupts and wood is consumed.
A nation is born from deceit,
yet deceit deepens and the nation falls into disorder.
It is like the silkworm that spins a cocoon,
yet the cocoon completes and it perishes;
or man who creates matters,
yet his schemes multiply and they harm his life.
Only the most enlightened sage can refine his conduct and cultivate his actions,
preventing evil before it sprouts,
and correcting disorder before it arises.
A tree encircled ten times by a man’s arms begins as a sapling;
a hundred-foot-high terrace starts with a single shovelful.
If small evils are not addressed with fear,
they will grow into great calamities.
Ah! If wood does not rub against wood,
fire has no means to ignite;
if a nation lacks corrupt governance,
deceit has no means to arise.
With beginning and end,
right and wrong remain undisturbed.
Who can know this?
Only the sage!

△安知

All things steal the vital essence of Heaven and Earth to take form and grow,
while man steals the shapes of all things to wield and employ them,
and all things steal the strength of man to cultivate and propagate.
Each steals from the other in turn, yet all fulfill their proper roles,
unaware that they are part of the great transformation of all things.

Thus, those who master the art of *qi* (機) follow these three principles,
using the Way to take what is needed while harming nothing.
Things, too, recognize the art of taking.
For this reason, it is essential to act at the right time,
and to act at the right moment.
Thus it is said: To eat in harmony with the seasons brings order to the body,
to act in accord with the *qi* brings peace to all transformations.
To act against the seasons and miss the *qi* is to invite calamity and disorder.

△Divine and Ancient—
The Old Master says:
*"When the work is done, do not claim it as your own;
act without clinging to the deed.*
This is the foundation of preserving life and establishing virtue."

The petty man, greedy for wealth, sacrifices his body for profit,
and, loving fame, struggles with force to gain renown.
He boasts of his marvels and seeks divine reputation,
yet all things resent him, and he will surely lose his life.
To seek gain is to invite loss—this is not divine.

The noble man accomplishes great deeds without claiming them,
prevents small misfortunes before they arise,
retreats from self to advance others,
and yields his abilities to benefit all things.
All things then honor him, and he does not seize their benefits.
His wisdom arises naturally, and he does not contend with things—
thus all things yield to him.
He does not linger behind, turning loss into gain—
this is the ultimate divine.

Thus the Old Master says:
*"To act is to court failure;
to cling is to lose.*
Truly, these words are profound!"

△The Sage-Sovereign

The **Sage-Sovereign** continues:

If a sage appears once every thousand years and a worthy once every five hundred, then the great and small among men are determined by the celestial cycles of sun and moon. When a great man emerges in the world, he fulfills his **virtue/power** and establishes sage-like achievements; when a petty man rises, he abandons the proper principles and brings forth calamity and chaos. Thus, **Taigong** spoke to **Xībó** of **Zhīrén Wàng** and yet he returned to **Zhōu**; **Liú Kūn** expressed himself in **Lángyá**, recognizing the **Heavenly Time** yet never left **Jìn Líng**; the **Mother** died knowing that the **Bright Sovereign** would surely arise and the **Brackets** would be restored, yet she did not punish him, for she saw that **Zhào’s army** would surely be defeated. Thus, the **Dao/Way of Heaven** and human affairs are such that the worthy can foresee them.

Assist the unworthy, and he will perish with his nine clans. Therefore, the *Yìjing* says:
*"The eldest son leads the army,
and founds the state, completing the lineage.
Do not employ the petty man—
he will surely disrupt the land."*

△**Mìnggǔ**

The **Dao/Way** of success and failure has not yet manifested, nor have the mechanisms of life and death been revealed—yet the petty man can perceive them, while the noble man can truly know them. Perception is easy, yet knowledge is difficult; what is seen is near, yet what is known is far.

The man who perceives the **mechanism** merely follows the times and seizes advantage, yet he cannot preserve his natural lifespan. The man who truly knows the **mechanism** traces beginnings and grasps endings, thereby ensuring the preservation of his life.

△**Bèigǔ**

The blind excel in hearing—**qi** does not depart from their ears;
the deaf excel in sight—**mind** does not depart from their eyes.
In their hearing, **qi** is wholly concentrated in the ears;
in their sight, **mind** is wholly concentrated in the eyes.
The ears and eyes are successive **tools/assistants** for each other.
When one is used, the other’s advantage is cut off.
Where the **mind** directs, there is no matter it does not master—
already possessing tenfold advantage, how much more so when it repeatedly applies this **tool/assistant**?
With threefold reflection and sincere calculation,
to follow the times while concealing or revealing,
to respond to the **mechanism** in action or retreat—
using this **tool/assistant** thus,
one attains a ten-thousandfold victory.

△**Wùzhāi**

The human **mind** moves without cause.
Life and death arise from external things.
Things move, and the **mind** is born;
things are still, and the **mind** dies.
The states of life and death—
do they not depend entirely on things?

△**Mùgǔ**

The eyes are the **gate** of **qi**,
and **qi** is the **master** of the **mind**.
The **qi**’s ebb and flow know no other path than the eyes.
Thus, those who perceive the **mechanism** all esteem the eyes,
while those who truly know the **mechanism** all esteem the **mind**.

△**Chǔnrán Zhī**

The **Dao/Way** of the **Ultimate Sage** is profound and without action.
Without action, there is no **mechanism**;
without **mechanism**, there is **ultimate stillness**.
The subtleties of **laws and calendars** lie in motion—
when moved, they can be known.
Yet when the **body** is void and empty,
no **method/technique** can apply its **control/measurement**—
just as warriors who do not lose their **mechanism**,
who do not expose their **signs/portents**,
though wise men may follow,
from where shall they be governed?

△**Xiànggǔ**

Wondrous instruments are the result of **yin** and **yang**,
capable of generating all things—
just as the human **mind** can create all phenomena.
Advancing forward, they manifest their forms.
The **Eight Trigrams** and **Six Jia**—
these are the secrets of **ghosts and gods**,
the arts of **yin-yang** interaction,
clearly arrayed in their states before us.
