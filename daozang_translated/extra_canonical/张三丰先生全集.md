**Preface to *The Complete Works of Patriarch Sanfeng***

Since ancient times, those who could alternately conceal and reveal themselves without straying from the true Dao—were they not the perfected ones? Those who could conceal but not reveal sank deep into seclusion, benefiting the world not at all; those who could reveal but not conceal wore themselves away day by day, achieving nothing for themselves. Yet when they emerged, they brought timely rain; when they withdrew, they dwelled amid mist and clouds—how could they be barren and inactive? Surely not. The highest immortals conceal themselves in the world yet deliver the world; they appear to others without clinging to them—this is the marvel of concealment and revelation.

Our Patriarch Sanfeng possessed the clarity to perceive subtle signs and upheld the principle of righteousness. As a Confucian, he could advance or retreat as circumstances demanded; as an immortal, he could soar or remain hidden. In the interplay of advance and retreat, flight and concealment, he embodied the great Dao of the dragon.

I, Xi Ling, a humble official mired in the dust of the world, once failed to grasp the root of things. In my youth, I studied the Confucian classics, hoping only to serve the age. Now, weary, I long to wander forever among the clouds and mountains, to roam with Anqi and Xianmen. Formerly, when I served as an official in Jiannan, then in Shuibei, and later in Chaozhou, the cares of office and the sea of worldly troubles weighed heavily upon me. Fortunately, I encountered our Patriarch, whose enlightening words awakened me. He summoned me and said: *"Now that a sage rules above, with worthy ministers and renowned officials assisting in governance, do not forget the days when you dwelled with me on Penglai."* Reflecting on this afterward, I was profoundly enlightened.

In this flourishing age, how could I willingly fade into obscurity? Yet when I consider the countless officials like myself—few who attain, many who lose—why should I remain entangled in the world’s net? Thus, I took the two volumes of the Patriarch’s alchemical classics and his various poems and essays, studying them day and night to seek liberation. In moments of leisure, whether in dreams, among mountains and rivers, or in the company of phoenixes and cranes, I was again favored with the Patriarch’s direct instruction. He taught that the Dao originated with the Most High and was transmitted by Master Xiyi. To conceal is to conceal; to reveal is to reveal. There is revelation within concealment and concealment within revelation—nothing concealed is not revealed, and nothing revealed is not concealed. In all this, he never sought audience with lords or engaged in lofty discourse on gold and stone, nor did he belong to the school of mere techniques.

I have recorded over thirty instances of the Patriarch’s miraculous manifestations and preserved them. The profound subtleties I personally received, I have kept in written form while omitting the oral instructions, fearing their premature disclosure. One day, when I soar ten thousand miles on the wind and ride a crane to the Three Mountains, to whom shall I entrust this book?

Written in the first month of the minor yang of the first year of Yongzheng’s reign, by Wang Xiling, *Tongyi Dafu*, Vice Director of River Conservancy for Henan Province, with reverence and purification.

**Preface**

At the beginning of the Ming dynasty, immortals appeared in great numbers: Zhou Dianxian of Nanchang, Zhang Jinghua of Linchuan, and Leng Qijing, the *Xielü Lang*—all silently observed the trends of the age and aided in extraordinary achievements. Yet their playful miracles, which astonished even the Son of Heaven, were later imitated by charlatans to deceive others.

Master Zhang Sanfeng rode a crane across Liaodong and gathered clouds in Jibei. Recognized by Minister Lian for his literary talent and insight, he was recommended for the post of county magistrate, but soon resigned to return home and wander with Master Chisong. By the Zhizheng era, the Master had already attained profound realization.

In the early years of Daoguang, I returned from Zhejiang and now serve as an instructor in Jiayang. In my spare time from teaching, I have come to cherish books on nourishing life. Once, at the study of Master Li, I obtained *The Complete Works of Sanfeng*, preserved by the late Inspector Wang Mengjiu of Jiannan. Only then did I learn of the Master’s conduct in literature and withdrawal—his purity and loftiness, unmatched by others. This is indeed a secret treasure from the celestial library.

Master Li, finding the book decayed beyond use after many years, was eager to have it printed and preserved. He also gathered inscriptions from famous mountains and copies from Daoist abbeys to fill its gaps, thus compiling it into a coherent and distinctive work.

Formerly, Emperor Taizong of Song said to his ministers: *"Chen Tuan of Mount Hua, who cultivated himself in solitude without pursuing power or profit, may truly be called a transcendent scholar."* Could Sanfeng be the one to carry on the legacy of Xiyi?

**Introduction**

I have read *The Complete Works of Patriarch Lü*, which meticulously compiles his regulated poetry from the Tang dynasty, his traces through successive dynasties, and serves to revive the primal wind and instruct later generations. Master Zhang Sanfeng’s virtue was lofty and profound, his writings vast and boundless, his beneficence universal—no different from Patriarch Lü. His works were once printed during the Yongle era of the former Ming, but the blocks decayed over time. Yet many of his writings survive in other collections.

Patriarch Lü’s works were compiled by Han San. Could Master Zhang’s works be allowed to scatter and vanish? Perhaps the time was not yet ripe. At the beginning of this dynasty, when Inspector Wang Mengjiu served in Jiannan, the Master manifested himself in his official residence. Many of Mengjiu’s virtuous policies in military and civil governance were inspired by the Master. Mengjiu preserved the old edition, gathered lost texts, and intended to print them, even planning to petition the governor to establish a shrine—yet none of these came to fruition. The time, it seems, was still not at hand.

The Recluse of Changyi Mountain and the Hermit of Dun Garden, who have forgotten fame and profit, obtained the Master’s writings from the home of Mengjiu’s sixth-generation descendant, Wang Tan, with seven or eight parts out of ten preserved. They supplemented it with texts from other sources and had it printed on pearwood blocks, fulfilling Mengjiu’s unaccomplished wish.

Though I have not yet traveled extensively to Wudang, Baoji, or other famous sites to collect the Master’s authentic traces in exhaustive detail, upon examining the beginning and end of this collection, I find it a rich and complete work, comparable to *The Complete Works of Patriarch Lü*. Even if some parts are missing, they can be supplemented later.

In the late Ming dynasty, the search for the Master spanned over a decade, yet he remained elusive. Alone, he concealed himself in the world while aiding it, sustaining the qi and the fortunes of the age in a place unknown to all. Unsullied by even the faintest dust, he stood so lofty as to be beyond reach—no transcendent immortal or sagely being surpassed him. The enlightened Ming sovereign bestowed upon him the title *"Penetrating the Subtle, Manifesting Transformation,"* yet *The History of the Ming* mistakenly relegated him to the ranks of minor occult practitioners. Such an error!

Those who read this collection will encounter the Master within its words and again beyond them, feeling as though they too might ascend, light as a feather, toward immortality. Those with true understanding will grasp this of their own accord.

Chengzi said: *"There are methods for warding off illness and prolonging life, but none for ascending to heaven in broad daylight."* Ouyang Xiu said: *"There are arts of nurturing life, but no such thing as immortals."* Yet I hold that warding off illness and nurturing life *are* the Dao of immortality. As *The Yellow Court Classic* states: *"Immortals and Daoists possess no divine powers; they accumulate essence and amass qi to attain perfection."* How just and balanced a view!

Now, the valley is emptiness; the spirit is numinous awareness. When emptiness and numinosity remain undimmed, one becomes a Confucian; when the valley spirit does not perish, one attains the Dao. How then is immortality different?

During the transition between the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Master Sanfeng alone preserved his nature and life amidst the chaos of the world. He sought no recognition from lords and princes, delving deeply into the Dao to realize it for himself. He silently reflected: when officials of prefectures and counties, burdened by toil, sent letters and gifts to summon him, these were but distractions that obscured his numinous awareness and harmed his valley spirit. Thus, he rejected them, cast them aside, evaded them, and concealed himself. Truly, as the saying goes: *"If there are immortals in the world, they must dwell deep in cliffs and ravines, fearing only that others might know of them."* Such was the Master’s steadfast integrity.

Amid wind and snow, he could sleep undisturbed—not merely warding off illness. His beard and brows remained unaged—far beyond mere life nurturance! Just as light is inseparable from the brilliance of sun and moon, and vastness from the waters of the sea, how can we deny the possibility of shedding the mortal coil, sprouting wings, ascending in broad daylight, and attaining immortality beyond the azure heavens?

In the early years of the Yongzheng reign, when Magistrate Wang Mengjiu governed Jiannan, the Master manifested his dharmakāya in the magistrate’s residence. One might well say he remained in the world even after five hundred years. Recognizing the truth and evidence of the immortal’s Dao, Magistrate Wang compiled the Master’s writings and deeds into a book, intending to broaden the perspective of those seeking to ward off illness and prolong life. Scholar Zhuo’an Liu obtained Wang’s compilation and supplemented its records, carving it onto printing blocks for transmission to later generations. Those who chant his poems and read his works should understand that the Dao of immortality is no empty claim.

**Biographical Account**
Zhang Sanfeng, a native of Yizhou in Liaodong.

**Names and Epithets**
His given name was Quanyi. Another name, Junshi; Sanfeng was his sobriquet. For his refusal to cultivate mere worldly blessings, he was also called Zhang Lǎtā. Of joyous and towering bearing, his form resembled a tortoise’s, his back a crane’s—great ears, round eyes, a beard bristling like halberds. Through winter and summer he wore but a single patched robe and straw raincoat. What he ate—whether a sheng or a dou—he consumed entirely; sometimes he ate but once in several days, sometimes not for months. Whatever he read, he never forgot. His wanderings knew no fixed abode; some said he could cover a thousand li in a day. Fond of jesting, he acted as if no one else were present.

Once, roaming the cliffs and ravines of Mount Wudang, he told people, “This mountain shall one day flourish greatly.” At the time, the Five Dragons, South Cliff, and Purple Cloud temples had all been ravaged by war. Sanfeng and his disciples cleared the brambles, removed the rubble, and built thatched huts to dwell in—only to leave soon after. The Taizu Emperor had long heard of his name, and in the twenty-fourth year of the Hongwu reign dispatched envoys to seek him, but they did not find him.

Later, he resided at Golden Terrace Abbey in Baoji. One day, he announced his impending death, left a gatha, and passed away. The county’s people prepared a coffin and laid him to rest. As they were about to inter him, sounds came from within the coffin. Opening it, they found him alive. He then traveled to Sichuan, where he met the Prince of Shu. Returning to Wudang, he journeyed through Xiang and Han, his traces ever more wondrous and elusive.

During the Yongle reign, the Chengzu Emperor sent the Supervising Secretary Hu Ying, accompanied by the eunuch Zhu Xiang, bearing an imperial edict, incense, and silks to seek him. They scoured the wild frontiers for years but did not encounter him. The emperor then commanded the Vice Minister of Works, Guo Jin, and the Marquis of Longping, Zhang Xin, to oversee over three hundred thousand laborers in the grand restoration of Wudang’s temples and abbeys, expending millions. Upon completion, the mountain was bestowed the name “Mount Taihe Taiyue,” and officials were appointed, seals cast for its governance. Thus was Sanfeng’s prophecy fulfilled.

Some say Sanfeng was a man of the Jin dynasty, that in the early Yuan he studied under the same master as Liu Bingzhong, and later learned the Dao at Upper Clarity Abbey in Luyi—yet none of this can be verified. In the third year of the Tianshun reign, the Yingzong Emperor conferred upon him the posthumous title “Perfected of Penetrating Mystery and Manifest Transformation,” though none could fathom whether he still lived.

**Further Biographical Account**
The Recluse of the Jetavana Grove records: Zhang Lǎtā, named Junshi, styled Xuan’yi; also called Xuanxuan. A native of Yizhou in Liaodong, he was the fifth son of Zhang Zhong’an. Of stalwart and imposing bearing, his form resembled a tortoise’s, his bones a crane’s—great ears, round eyes, a beard bristling like halberds, his topknot bound in one coil. He styled himself “Master Sanfeng of Preserving Harmony and Enduring Patience,” ever carrying a blade and measuring square. Through winter and summer he wore but a single patched robe. Sometimes he dwelt in desolate seclusion, sometimes wandered the marketplaces, vast and unconstrained, as if no one else were present. When questioned, he might remain silent all day; yet when discoursing on the Three Teachings and their scriptures, his words flowed ceaselessly, all rooted in the Dao, virtue, loyalty, and filial piety. He often foreknew events. Sometimes he ate but once in three to five days, or even once in two or three months—yet he could scale mountains as if flying. In the depths of winter, he might sleep in the snow, snoring like thunder. The people of his time marveled at him, hence his sobriquet, Zhang Lǎtā.

At the end of the Yuan, he resided at Golden Terrace Abbey in Baoji. One day, he announced his departure from the world and passed away. His followers prepared a coffin and laid him to rest, but when they opened it before burial, he had revived. He then entered Sichuan, reached Qin, traveled through Xiang and Deng, wandered Chang’an, and traversed Long, Min, and Gansu. In the early Hongwu reign, he entered Wudang, ascended Heavenly Pillar Peak, and visited all its famous sites. He had his disciple Qiu Yuanjing reside at Five Dragons, Lu Qiuyun at South Cliff, and Liu Guquan and Yang Shandeng at Purple Cloud. He himself built a thatched hut north of Banner Peak, naming it Encountering Perfection Abbey, and a grass hermitage at Earthen Wall, calling it Meeting Immortals Lodge, entrusting his disciple Zhou Zhide to guard it.

In the *gengwu* year of the Hongwu reign, he departed with a flick of his sleeve, vanishing without a trace. The next year, the Taizu Emperor sent Daoists from the Three Mountains to summon him to court, but he was nowhere to be found. Some said he dwelt in Cloud Gate Grotto in Qingzhou. In the early Yongle reign, the emperor dispatched the Supervising Secretary Hu Ying and the Commander Yang Yongji to seek him, but they did not find him. In the second month of the tenth year, the Chengzu Emperor wrote a letter and sent the Daoist Yuanxuzi to Wudang, where he built an altar at Xuanxuan’s old haunts, burned incense, and prayed for word of him—but to no avail. The emperor then composed a poem and bestowed it upon him, containing the lines: *“If you meet the true immortal Zhang Youdao, / Tell him I await him with longing.”*

By the end of the Tianshun reign, he appeared and disappeared at will.

Upon hearing this, the emperor bestowed upon him the title *"Perfected One of Penetrating the Subtle and Manifesting Transformations."* Later, he came and went from Mount Heming for half a year before vanishing without a trace.

From *Qixiu Leigao*
By Ming dynasty scholar Lang Ying

The immortal Zhang, styled Junshi, was called Quanyi. A native of Yizhou in Liaodong, he was also known as Xuanxuan, or by the sobriquet "Three Peaks Master of Preserving Harmony and Enduring Patience." In his time, people also called him "Zhang the Unkempt." In the third year of the Tianshun reign, he once came to pay homage to the emperor. I have seen his portrait: his beard and temples bristled upward, a single topknot hung down his back, his face was ruddy and his belly large, and he carried a bamboo hat. The emperor composed an edict for him, granting him the title *"Grand Perfected One of Penetrating the Subtle and Manifesting Transformations."*

From *Huaihai Zaji*
By Ming dynasty scholar Lu Xixing

The old immortal Three Peaks was a descendant of the Dragon-Tiger lineage. His ancestor, Lord Yuxian, was learned and skilled in astrological divination. He moved his family to Yizhou in Jin territory and lived among the common folk with his son, Chang. Only after Yizhou was taken by the Yuan did their names gradually become known, though Lord Chang remained one who roamed beyond the world. His wife, née Lin, had previously given birth to four sons in two pregnancies—Ao, You, Xiao, and Yao—all of whom died young. Later, she bore two more sons: Tong and Da. Tong was the old immortal. On the night of his birth, Lin dreamed that the Dipper Mother, the Primordial Sovereign, beckoned a great crane to alight upon the roof, where it let out three long cries before she awoke in startlement—only to find herself in labor. From childhood, he possessed extraordinary qualities, and in adulthood, he carried himself with talent and skill. While traveling in Yanjing, his old friend Liu Bingzhong saw him and marveled, saying, *"Truly, he is a celestial talent."*

He withdrew in silence, eventually securing a minor post in the bitter cold of Zhongshan, but upon returning home for mourning, he never again took office. He once remarked, *"Wealth and honor are like the wind-blown lamp or morning dew on grass; time passes like lightning or fleeting bubbles in rain."* Thus resolved, he dedicated himself to seeking the Dao. He sought masters on Mount Zhongnan and there received the wondrous teachings of the Fire Dragon. Gradually, he feigned madness and filth, so that none could recognize him. Throughout his life, he composed poetry and prose on tree bark, moss, tea dregs, spoons, and chopsticks—accumulating decades of work that he could still recite from memory, though he never transcribed it to show others. Thus, no one in the Yuan dynasty’s literary circles knew of him.

His son was Daoyi; his grandsons, Mingluan and Minghe. Luan, in the early Ming, relocated to Huaiyang. His sixth-generation descendant, the Daoist Huagu, was Luan’s direct grandson and a friend beyond the world to me. His family possessed a garden of exquisite beauty, where the old immortal once stayed. When questioned about past anecdotes, he presented several hundred poems of his travels, several precious scriptures, and a single scroll of alchemical secrets, commanding that they be preserved. Whenever Huagu spoke of these things to me, it stirred boundless reverie.

*Biography of Master Sanfeng*
Respectfully recorded by Wang Xiling

Master Sanfeng’s surname was Zhang, his given name Tong, and his courtesy name Junshi. His ancestors hailed from Longhushan in Jiangxi, and he often referred to himself as a descendant of the Celestial Masters. His father, Lord Yuxian, was learned in astrology and mathematics. At the end of the Southern Song, foreseeing that the imperial *qi* would rise from the north, he led his clan to Yizhou in Liaoyang. He had a son named Juren, also called Chang, with the courtesy names Zian and Zhongan, and the sobriquet Baishan—this was the Master’s father. In his prime, he possessed extraordinary talent, and when the Yuan Emperor Taizong summoned men of ability, dividing the examinations into three categories, Chang passed the policy essay section. Yet his nature was inherently indifferent to officialdom, and he spent his life in reclusion.

In the summer of the *dingwei* year of Emperor Dingzong’s reign, the Master’s mother, Madame Lin, dreamed of a primordial crane flying from the sea and sky—whereupon she gave birth to the Master on the ninth day of the fourth month, at the hour of *zi*. His appearance was striking, with the form of a tortoise and the bones of a crane, large ears, and round eyes. At five, his eyes were afflicted by a strange malady, and over time, his vision gradually dimmed.

At that time, there was a certain Zhang Yun’an, an extraordinary figure beyond the mundane world. He presided over the Biluo Palace and styled himself the White Cloud Chan Elder. Upon seeing the Master, he marveled, saying, "This child possesses the bearing of an immortal and the bones of a Daoist adept—truly no ordinary vessel. Yet his eyes are afflicted by demonic obstruction. He must take this poor monk as his master to dispel the dust-born veil and restore the radiance of his wisdom-pearl." He then sent the Master home. Madame Lin consented, and the Master became Yun’an’s disciple. After half a year of quiet seclusion, his eyes gradually brightened. He was taught Daoist scriptures, which he grasped upon a single reading. In his spare time, he also studied the books of the Confucian and Buddhist traditions, perusing them at will and comprehending their essential meanings before setting them aside. Seven years passed in this manner until Madame Lin grew homesick for him, and Yun’an did not detain him. Thus, the Master took his leave and returned home to devote himself to Confucian scholarship.

In the first year of the Zhongtong era, he was recommended as an exceptional talent; in the second year, his literary ability and erudition were noted, and his name was submitted to the throne for potential appointment. Yet this was not his true aspiration—he had merely sought to emulate Mao of Lujiang, who accepted an official post to honor his parents. In the autumn of the *jiazi* year of the Zhiyuan era, he traveled to Yanjing. At that time, the court had just established its capital there, and a decree summoned those previously listed for their literary talent to await employment. He lingered in the markets of Yanjing, his reputation growing daily, until he became acquainted with the Grand Councilor, Lord Lian Xixian. Struck by the Master’s talent, Lord Lian memorialized the throne to appoint him magistrate of Zhongshan and Boling, and the Master assumed office.

During his leisure from official duties, he visited Mount Gehong, said to be the place where Zichuan had cultivated the Dao. Reflecting on his own post, as desolate as the Goulou region, he mused, "Could I not follow Zichuan’s example?" The following year, however, he encountered the mourning of his father’s passing, and soon after, news of his mother’s death arrived. The Master then renounced all thought of official advancement. Observing the mourning rites, he returned to Liaoyang, where he grieved day and night. Seeking a lofty and secluded mountain, he arranged for his parents’ burial. Once the tomb was completed, he remained there for several years, reciting the *Dongjing* scriptures daily.

Suddenly, a certain Daoist adept named Qiu arrived at his door. Their profound discussion of metaphysical principles filled the room with a breeze of clarity, evoking in the Master a longing for the life beyond the world. After Qiu’s departure, the Master packed his belongings and set out on his travels, entrusting his fields and property to his clansmen with instructions to tend the graves. He took two young attendants with him and wandered north to Yan and Zhao, east to Qi and Lu, and south to Han and Wei, visiting famous mountains and ancient monasteries, composing poetry, and observing the world at leisure, sometimes staying, sometimes moving on. For nearly thirty years, he encountered nothing of significance.

Then he turned westward to Qin and Long, drawing in the qi of Mount Taihua and absorbing the marvels of Mount Taibai. He traversed the Baoxie Road, crossed Chen Cang, and found the valleys and marshes of Baoji Mountain deep and serene. There he settled. Within the mountain stood Three-Peak Mountain, its three summits towering and verdant, a delight to behold. Thus, he styled himself the Layman of Three Peaks.

In the first year of the Yanyou era, at the age of sixty-seven, he entered the Zhongnan Mountains and encountered the Fire Dragon Perfected, who transmitted to him the Great Dao. He changed his name to Xuansu, also called Xuanhua, and adopted the sobriquets Master Xuanyuan and Master Kunyang. After four years of dwelling in the mountains, his cultivation yielded no visible results. Hearing that those who pursued this path required both method and resources, and recalling his lifelong travels and generosity had nearly emptied his purse, he could not help but shed tears. The Fire Dragon, surprised, inquired into the matter and then transmitted to him the secret of transmuting cinnabar. He commanded the Master to leave the mountains and refine the elixir.

The Master took leave of his benevolent teacher and lived among the common people for several years, blending in without drawing attention. In the spring of the *jiazi* year of the Taiding era, he traveled south to Wudang, where he refined his spirit for nine years before finally achieving the Dao. Thereafter, he wandered in seclusion and openness for over a decade between the clouds of Xiang and the rains of Ba.

In the early years of the Zhizheng era, he returned from Chu to Liaoyang to visit his parents’ graves, then went back to Yanjing. There, he found that all the high officials and old acquaintances he had known were gone. He then retreated to the Western Mountains, where he encountered the Daoist adept Qiu from before. As they spoke of the heart and conversed on the Dao, sitting knee to knee in deep exchange, he realized Qiu was none other than Master Fuyang, the Perfected of Everlasting Spring.

After parting, he journeyed again to Qin and Shu, then from Jing and Chu to Wu and Yue, sojourning in Jinling. There he met Shen Wansan and transmitted to him the Dao of the Elixir. This occurred in the nineteenth year of the Zhizheng era. At their farewell, the Master foresaw that Wansan would face exile and urged him, "The royal qi of the southeast is still flourishing—we shall meet again in the southwest." He then returned to Qin and resided at the Golden Terrace Abbey in Baoji.

On the twentieth day of the ninth month, his yang spirit departed on a journey. A scholar named Yang Guishan, believing the Master had passed away, purchased a coffin and prepared his remains. As the coffin was about to be interred, a sound like thunder erupted from within. When opened, the Master was found alive. It turned out that his yang spirit had departed, and those of simple and honest nature had mistakenly believed him dead. Later, he took Guishan with him and vanished.

Two years later, the world underwent sudden upheaval—seas cleared anew, the Yuan dynasty’s reign abruptly ended, and the Ming’s fortune dawned. The Master then built a hut on Mount Taihe, feigning madness; people called him the "Slovenly Daoist." A Daoist named Qiu Yuanjing, serene and admirable, secretly took him as his disciple.

Later, he entered Chengdu and urged King Chun of Shu to embrace the Dao, but the king refused. Retreating to the region between Xiang and Deng, he vanished without a trace. In the seventeenth year of the Hongwu era, as the emperor saw all under heaven submit, he issued an edict seeking the Master, who did not respond. The following year, Shen Wansan was pressed to extend another invitation, but again, the Master declined. For emperors possess their own Dao—golden elixirs and liquid gold cannot divert a sovereign’s resolve to govern with diligence. Since ancient times, alchemists have courted disaster by entering court as immortals; those who ascend to sagehood and perfection never become like Tang’s Ye Fashan or Song’s Lin Lingsu—past missteps serve as warning enough.

In the twenty-fifth year, he vanished into Yunnan. Coincidentally, the emperor had exiled Wansan to the coast, and thus the Master fulfilled their pact, meeting him to refine the Great Medicine of Heavenly Primordial ingestion. The following year, the work complete, he first traveled to Fuquan Mountain in Pingyue, Guizhou, where he paid homage to the Perfected and worshipped the Dipper, awaiting the imperial summons to ascend.

In the first year of the Jianwen era, Wanpuzi sought the Master on Mount Wudang. Arriving just as he returned from Pingyue, they rejoiced in their reunion. In the fourth year of the Yongle era, the Academician Reader Hu Guang memorialized that the Master possessed profound Daoist arts and wondrous powers. In the fifth year, the emperor dispatched Hu Ying and others to search for him across the realm. In the tenth year, Sun Biyun was ordered to build a palace on Wudang and await his arrival, even sending a letter to invite him. Yet by the fourteenth year, no trace of him had been found.

Enraged, the emperor rebuked Hu Guang: *"You claimed Zhang Sanfeng harbored arcane mysteries—why does he dare not come before me?"* He commanded Guang to seek him out. Terrified, Guang hastened to Wudang by night, burning incense and weeping in prayer. On the first day of the fifth month that year, as the Southern Culmen celebrated the myriad longevity of the Old Lord, the immortals gathered at the appointed hour. The Master was among those summoned, and with the officials of the Dark Heaven Palace, he rode the qi in unison. Noticing Guang’s earnest plea, he halted his cloud chariot and promised that after an audience at court, he would fulfill the command to ascend to the Upper Clarity. Then, he drifted away like mist.

The following year, Hu Ying and his party returned to court, having never glimpsed the Master. *O my teacher! O my teacher!*

O hidden immortal among the reclusive! O divine being among the immortals! O celestial immortal among the divine transcendents! Having received the Jade Edict, he ascended to the grand assembly of the perfected, ranked among the Palace of Dui, his body refined into a celestial vessel—thus could he wield divine transformations, succoring the world and delivering its people. In every direction, above and below, wherever the void extended, his simurgh-drawn chariot arrived, for he embodied the profound vow and the vast Dharma-gate. Since Lüzu’s time, none but the Master alone had borne such a mantle.

I, Xi Ling, a dust-bound official of the mundane world, had nearly forgotten my original tone and root. While inspecting Jiannan, I seldom practiced benevolent governance, yet undeservedly enjoyed rich emoluments, thus betraying the imperial grace. For two years, the sun had rarely shone, and floods had repeatedly risen. Thereupon, I bared my feet, pared my nails, and reverently prayed to the spirit of Mount Mei. For seven days I offered incense, until radiant sunlight bathed all, and distant vistas unfolded—amidst wondrous peaks and strange waters, I fortunately encountered the Master. Discerning my humble sincerity, he summoned me into the Dao and bestowed upon me a chapter of the *Secret Formulae of the Elixir Canon* and two scrolls of the *Essentials of Swift Attainment*. Following his method in cultivation, I first glimpsed the mysterious workings. Henceforth, I repented my entry into officialdom. My spirit roamed mountains and rivers, and soon I resigned my post, built a hut beneath Lingyun, yet know not in what year or day I may shed the net of the worldly, gather jade blossoms, and offer peach fruits in homage to the Master.

Having served the Master for long, I learned his origins in great detail. Thus, purifying my turbid heart, I reverently compile this account to pass on to those who shall succeed in our lineage.

**A Biography of Master Sanfeng**
*By Yuanqiao Waishi*

The Master was a native of Yizhou in Liaoyang. His sobriquets changed repeatedly, and his wanderings knew no fixed abode, so that many could not fathom his whereabouts. He shared a teacher with Liu Bingzhong. During the early Zhiyuan era, he was recommended by Lian Xixian and appointed to office; in the later Zhiyuan era, he retired from his official post. In the early Hongwu reign, the Taizu Emperor repeatedly summoned him, but he never emerged, for he had concealed himself as an immortal to preserve his loyalty to the Yuan. Thus, he once styled himself "A Remnant Elder of the Great Yuan" and also praised himself as "A Recluse of the Great Yuan." Gentlemen deeply lamented that his renown as a divine immortal had overshadowed his solitary loyalty.

In his lifelong quest for the Dao, he endured countless hardships. After meeting his teacher on Zhongnan Mountain, he sought companions and the "lead" elixir across the ends of the earth, ultimately attaining the Great Dao on Mount Wudang. What is most extraordinary is that before the Master’s descent into the world, a place on Wudang had already been prepared for him. Formerly, Master Xiyi, while traveling on Mount Taihua, encountered the extraordinary figure Sun Jun, who inquired: "The Nine-Chambered Cliff on Wudang is secluded and tranquil—fit for dwelling. Your later disciple shall arise from this mountain, and your glory shall greatly flourish." For he already knew that the famous mountain had its master, and the Great Dao had its Dharma-heir. Is this not extraordinary?

I once heard in the records of the Venerable Kuzhu that Master Zhongli Quan had foretold: "One day, a man with two mouths shall be your disciple," and later he indeed met Lüzu. Could it be that when a perfected one descends, their birth year, month, day, hour, native place, and surname are predestined in the Great Luo Heaven? Otherwise, how could such words prove so accurate? Even Yuantong Zhenren, a disciple of the Master, could not inquire into the reason.

This *Primary Biography*, meticulously recorded, aligns with the *Immortal Mirror* and the *Ming Annals* in its investigations. Only then did I learn the Master’s native place and birth, his cultivation of truth and attainment of the Dao—so complete was he in all these.

**Daoist Lineage**
The wellspring of the Great Dao began with Laozi, who transmitted it to Yin Wen-shih. After five transmissions, it reached Master Sanfeng. Though Laozi’s transmissions were many, among the most eminent were Yin Wen-shih and Wang Shaoyang. Branching into various lineages, each had its own heirs. Here, I shall speak only of Wen-shih’s line.

Wen-shih transmitted to Ma Yi, Ma Yi to Xiyi, Xiyi to Huolong, and Huolong to Sanfeng. Some regard this as the "Hidden Immortal Lineage": Wen-shih concealed himself as a magistrate and on Mount Taibai; Ma Yi hid in Shitang and on Mount Huang; Xiyi on Mount Taihua; Huolong on Zhongnan; and the Master on Wudang. This is the theory of the Hidden Lineage. While all divine immortals can conceal themselves, this lineage is especially profound in its reclusion.

Confucius said: "Laozi is like a dragon!"—referring to his deep concealment beyond fathoming. Thus, this line is also called the "Dragon-like Lineage." Of Laozi’s Dao, Wen-shih’s line is the highest, while Shaoyang’s line is the greatest. Shaoyang transmitted to Zhengyang, Zhengyang to Chunyang, Chunyang first to Wang Chongyang, and Chongyang to Qiu Changchun, establishing the Northern Lineage. Chunyang also transmitted to Liu Haichan, Haichan to Zhang Ziyang, establishing the Southern Lineage.

Tracing Wen-shih’s line, it passed to Ma Yi and then to Xiyi; tracing Shaoyang’s line, Liu Haichan also transmitted the elixir method to Xiyi, where the two lineages converged. Thus, Master Sanfeng may be called of Wen-shih’s line, or of Shaoyang’s line—yet his pure wind and lofty integrity ultimately aligned him more closely with Ma Yi, Xiyi, and Huolong.

**Succession of Former Ancestors**
The details of the Most High Lord Lao are unknowable. Across kalpas, he manifested in countless incarnations, leaving no trace of birth. Once, he told Wen-shih: "My surname and given name are boundless, spanning kalpas beyond recounting—this is no empty speech." By the time of King Wu Ding of Shang, he divided his spirit to transform into a swallow, first gestating in the womb of the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden for eighty-one years. In the gengchen year of King Wuding’s reign, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of mao, he was born beneath a plum tree in Lai Village, Quren Hamlet, in Ku County. Taking the plum as his surname, he was named Er, styled Boyang. Born with white hair, he was called "Laozi"; his long ears earned him the name "Laodan."

At the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, he observed the customs of Western Qi and styled himself Master of Zhi Village. When King Wen sought to appoint him as a grandee, he declined, accepting only the post of Archivist of the Royal Archives. There he concealed himself in reclusion. Later, he would sometimes hide beneath pillars, sometimes by the riverside; sometimes he called himself the Ancient Master, sometimes the Ancient Sovereign, sometimes Father Boyang, sometimes Master Guangcheng. He built a hut by the river or spread the teachings in the Western Regions. In the Qin dynasty, he was known as the Ancient Recluse, though none knew that the Most High Ancestral Lord was in truth the Sage concealed within the world.

Master Wen-shi, surnamed Yin, named Xi, styled Gongwen, was a native of Tianshui—or, as some say, of Chengji. He was born in the *dingsi* year of King Cheng’s reign, on the eighth day of the fourth month at an auspicious hour. He sought no fame or position, once serving as Magistrate of Hangu Pass, hence his title Guan Yin Xi. One day, he encountered three gusts of harmonious wind and divined their significance through wind-observation; he saw a purple qi approaching from the east and divined its meaning through qi-observation; at night, he watched the celestial patterns and noted a star moving westward past the Pleiades, mastering the heavens’ signs. He knew a sage was about to arrive. When Lord Lao reached the pass and Yin Xi beheld his spirit and countenance, he was greatly astonished, recognizing him through physiognomy. He bowed as a disciple and received the Great Dao. He composed nine chapters, titled *The Master of Hangu Pass*, later known as *The Scripture of Primordial Beginning*. Crossing the Flowing Sands to the west, he later returned to the Central Lands, sometimes called Yin Zhe, sometimes the Daoist Master Yin. He concealed himself on the northern slopes of Mount Zhongnan, where people called him "the Hidden Sage of Zhongnan."

Master Ma Yi, surnamed Li, named He, with the Daoist name Chuyang, was a native of Neixiang. He concealed himself in Stone Hall Mountain.

Born with divine marvel, his hair was deep blue and his bearing refined. As he grew, he despised the world’s corruption and filth, retreating to the quiet of Mount Zhongnan for cultivation. There he encountered Yin Wenshi, who transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao and the art of physiognomy, instructing him to refine his practice beside the rushing waters of Nanyang, on the sacred Lingtang Mountain. Dwelling in a grotto for nineteen years, he wore only hempen robes through winter and summer, hence the name Master Ma Yi. On the mountain flowed a spring whose waters remained warm year-round, called the Valley of the Rising Sun; he would bathe there often.

One evening, twelve youths appeared and bowed, saying: “We are dragons. The Celestial Emperor, seeing your Dao perfected, has commanded us to assist in the great transformation.” Thereafter, all who sought rain found their prayers answered. As the villagers’ entreaties grew ever more numerous, he withdrew to Mount Huang—also called Mount Yi—in She, where people called him “the Hidden One of Huangshan.”

Master Xiyi, surnamed Chen, named Tuan, styled Tunan, with the Daoist name Fuyao Zi, was a native of Zhenyuan in Bozhou. During the Changxing era of the Tang, though he sat for the imperial examinations, he did not pass. Thus he put aside worldly cares, delighting instead in mountains and rivers.

He resided on Mount Wudang for over twenty years before retiring to Huaxian’s Yuntai Abbey. There he mastered the art of the hibernating dragon, often lying abed for over a hundred days without rising. He encountered Hai Chan, who transmitted the essentials of the Dao. Meeting the Master of Hemp Robe, they sat facing each other by the stove, using an iron rod to trace characters in the ashes, silently imparting profound mysteries. He also received from Master Yin Wenshi the art of physiognomy. Remaining in reclusion, during the reign of Emperor Taizu of the Song he was bestowed the title "Master of White Clouds," and later "Master of Profound Serenity." Histories refer to him as "the Recluse of Mount Hua."

Master Fire Dragon was a senior disciple of Master of Profound Serenity. He concealed not only his person but also his name. His native place cannot be verified, for he took heaven and earth as his dwelling. His deeds were scarcely recorded, for he made hidden virtue his legacy. *The Mirror of Immortals* merely notes his title and describes his demeanor as transcending the mundane—much like Red Pine or Yellowstone, known to the world only as ancient immortals. Having dwelt in reclusion on Mount Zhongnan, he was called "the Recluse Immortal of Zhongnan." Some say he was Master Jia Desheng; this awaits verification by scholars of broad learning.

Master Sanfeng, surnamed Zhang, named Tong, styled Junshi, was a native of Yizhou in Liaodong. For details, see the complete collection.

**Eleven Later Records of Immortals: Accounts of Reclusive Worthies**

**Master Sanshan** was surnamed Shen, named Wansan, also called Wanshan, and styled himself the Daoist of Sanshan. A native of Jinling, he was a great fisherman of the Qinhuai, kind-hearted and fond of almsgiving. He encountered Master Sanfeng, from whom he received the method of elixir refinement. After further cultivating the Great Medicine of Heavenly Origin, he consumed it and ascended with his entire household. At times he concealed himself on Tianmu Mountain, at others on Wudang, with no fixed abode. Like Master Sanfeng, he appeared and vanished at will, transcending the world. He was imperially bestowed the title "Perfected of Vast Vows." Born in the first year of the Tianli reign of the Yuan dynasty, on the eighteenth day of the ninth lunar month, at the hour of *wei*.

**Qiu Yuanjing** was a Daoist of Wudang. In the early Hongwu reign, Master Sanfeng wandered to Wudang, where Yuanjing met him and became his disciple. Sanfeng transmitted to him the wonders of the Dao and instructed him to reside at Five Dragons, where he built a hut to cultivate and fulfill his great task. In the spring of the *yichou* year, Emperor Taizu issued an edict seeking Master Sanfeng but failed to find him. He then summoned Yuanjing, and upon conversing with him, was pleased. The emperor appointed him Surveillance Commissioner and offered him a residence, which he declined. He was then promoted to Minister of Rites, but again refused, prompting the emperor to praise his lofty integrity.

**The Four Immortals of Taihe**—Lu Qiuyun, Zhou Zhide, Liu Guquan, and Yang Shandeng—were all natives of Chu. In the early Hongwu reign, Master Sanfeng entered Wudang and built a hut on Zhanqi Peak. The four sought him as their teacher, and he transmitted to them the secret of preserving quietude and centeredness. He then instructed Qiuyun to reside at South Cliff, Zhide at the Hall of Meeting Immortals, and Guquan and Shandeng at Purple Cloud Peak. They cultivated in stillness simultaneously and later all attained realization.

**Master Ice Vessel** was surnamed Ming, named Zheng. A native of Neijiang, he was skilled in talismans and incantations, which often produced miraculous effects. During the Yongle reign, Master Sanfeng traveled to Shu and frequently lodged at his home. Ming wished to transmit his methods of talismans and incantations to Sanfeng, who smiled and said, "I shall offer you the Dao—how can you teach me your arts?" He then composed *A Memorial on the Convergence of Dao and Method* and presented it to Ming, who was greatly astonished and begged to become his disciple. After residing together for over a year, Hu Yong visited Master Sanfeng and took Ming away with him; their whereabouts thereafter were unknown.

**Wang Zongdao** was a native of Huaian. He once studied the Dao under Master Sanfeng. In the third year of the Yongle reign, Emperor Chengzu sought Master Sanfeng and ordered Zongdao to be found. He went with Hu Yong, and upon being summoned, was granted a golden crown and crane-feather robe, along with an imperial letter and incense to travel throughout the realm. After ten years without success, he returned and was bestowed the title "Perfected of Perfect Virtue." Later, he entered Mount Lu to gather herbs and vanished without a trace.

**Master Li** was named Xingzhi, a native of Chu. During the Zhengde reign, he entered Mount Taihe and encountered Master Sanfeng, who transmitted to him the method of elixir refinement, enabling him to attain the Dao. He was fond of sitting upright in stillness, composed and dignified, earning him the name "Master Li." He practiced grain avoidance and daily drank a broth of wheat flour, so people also called him "Bran Li." Prince Yongding of Jing, having heard of him with admiration, dispatched an envoy to invite him. He was lodged at the Wudang Palace in Qi, wearing tattered robes and abstaining from food.

The prince repeatedly summoned him to the palace to seek the secret of longevity, but he never responded, merely stating, "For a Confucian, cultivating the self and ordering the household is itself the secret of the Dao." Though lavished with gold and silk, he paid no heed. Later, he took his leave to return home, and the prince sent an attendant to escort him, instructing him to demand a written reply upon completion of his mission. When they reached the boat at Hankou, Master Li suddenly vanished. The attendant hurried the boatman to cross the river, and midstream, he suddenly saw Li lying upon the water and crossing. When the attendant reached the shore, Li had also arrived, only to disappear again. The attendant rushed to the mountain and found Li sitting on a perilous cliff, clapping his hands and singing. Soon after, Li shouted to the attendant, "Convey my thanks to the prince—Li shall not return again." As the attendant sought the promised written reply, Li vanished in an instant. Later, the prince sent another attendant to the mountain, who was told that Li had undergone *shijie* (corporeal liberation). On the return journey, the attendant again saw Li holding a begging bowl, moving as swiftly as if flying. Before long, the prince, through Qian Zongzheng’s memorial, nearly lost his state, and only then did he realize Li’s words had not been spoken lightly.

Master Mengjiu, surnamed Wang and named Xiling, was a native of She County in Huizhou. He had once served as an observer in Jiannan, but his worldly ambitions grew ever fainter, and his inclination toward reclusion deepened.

Having encountered Master Sanfeng on Mount Emei, he attained the subtleties of his Dao. Later, he was appointed as Intendant of the Yongbei Circuit in southern Yunnan, but immediately requested to retire to care for his parents, though his petition was not granted. Soon after, he was appointed Vice Commissioner of River Conservancy for the entire province of Henan. Taking the opportunity to return home for a visit, he achieved *dan*-completion and underwent *shijie*. He was styled "Perfected Adept of Universal Penetration." He collated *The Essential Mysteries* and composed *The Authentic Biography of Sanfeng*, *Manifest Traces*, and other chapters that have been transmitted to later generations. He was born in the year *jiachen* of the Kangxi reign, on the eighteenth day of the tenth month, at the hour of *shen*.

To this day, the Clear Radiance Pavilion on Danxia Peak of Mount Lingyun in Jiazhou remains the place where, in his spare time from official duties, he secretly cultivated his spirit and refined the elixir. Within it stands the Hall of the Numinous Mountain, where a plaque records the names of several hundred elders from Jiannan who celebrated his longevity, all hailing him as the benevolent and pure Perfected Master of Universal Penetration, who cultivated himself and governed others.

As for Master Baibai, his surname and given name remain unspoken. His dwelling lay amidst the mountains and waters of Qingcheng, Great Emei, and Jiazhou. He played the zither, read books, and was deeply fond of Laozi and Zhuangzi. In the early years of the Daoguang reign, he met Master Zhang Sanfeng on Mount Sui, who transmitted to him the mysteries of *jiaogou* and the Mysterious Female, as well as the Great Talisman of the Golden Crucible. Later, he encountered the Pure Yang Patriarch, from whom he learned the subtleties of gathering medicinal substances. Resolved to cultivate with utmost dedication, he daily conversed with two or three recluses, discussing misty peaks and evaluating waters and rocks. His worldly ambitions had grown as cold as ice.

His writings include *The River Chart and Luo Writing: An Illustrated Exegesis of the Changes*, *The True Meaning of the Dao and Its Virtue*, and *The Inner Chapters of the Round Isles*, which elucidate the stages of inner and outer alchemy in ways unprecedented in the ancient immortals’ classics. When idle, he blended with the world and harmonized with its light, silently embracing the profound mysteries. He is listed in the lineage of the immortals.

The Ten Lodgings Recluse was a disciple of Shen Wanshan. From youth, he was fond of charity, and Wanshan gave him his youngest daughter in marriage, transmitting to him the art of cinnabar transmutation. His wealth then rivaled that of his father-in-law. His daughter, Yu Huigang, became the second wife of Xiping Marquis Mu Chun and was likewise skilled in the arts of alchemy, these being family traditions. The account appears in the "Biographies of the Yu Father and Daughter" in this collection.

Lu Deyuan was a man of Wu. Though his family had long been of modest means, he aspired to the study of immortals. When Shen Wanshan met him, he recognized his aptitude for the Dao and transmitted to him the subtleties of the profound mysteries, along with alchemical wealth, which then sufficed his household. He associated with Gu Aying and Li Mingfeng, and among the literary gatherings and wine societies of the southeast, scholars praised him as wealthy yet refined. In the early Hongwu reign, he once donated twenty thousand *hu* of military grain. Upon hearing of this, the Taizu Emperor remarked, "Not even the prosperous elders of Jiangnan could match this," whereupon Lu sighed, "The seeds of disaster have come." Soon after, he took up his zither and donned a monk’s robe, disguising himself as a Daoist priest and fleeing. When Gu Aying learned of this, he too shaved his head and became a monk. Li Mingfeng abandoned his estate, taking his wife and children to drift upon the rivers and lakes. Later, when countless great families of Jiangnan were confiscated, people began to trust in his foresight.

Mingyang Xiansheng bore the surname Liu and the given name Guangzhu. Kind, reverent, and wealthy yet refined, he did good as it ought to be done, seeking no reward. The enlightened esteemed him highly. Once, he traveled with Baibaizi and received the teaching of "preserving tranquility and abiding in the center." He then built a hut by the great river, wandering among clouds and waters, never setting foot in the cities. Several years after his passing, he suddenly descended with a poem:

*"Man gone, lone crane’s shadow in the empty hills,
Gazing back, the dusty sea is veiled in mist.
The immortals’ numinous essence never fades—
A path of pure wind leads to the stone altar."*

Thereafter, his cloud companions and rosy friends all declared him undying. His work, *Poems on the Golden Elixir*, survives in several volumes, still held by his younger brother, Dunyuan.

**Fist Arts Lineage**
Wang Yuyang Xiansheng said: "In the arts of valor, Shaolin represents the external school, while Zhang Sanfeng of Wudang is the internal school. After Sanfeng, there was Wang Zong of Guanzhong, who transmitted the art to Chen Zhoutong of Wenzhou—a man of the Jiajing era. Thus, the transmission of both schools flourished in eastern Zhejiang. During the Shunzhi reign, the most renowned was Wang Laixian, styled Zhengnan, a man of Jin. On rainy days with nothing to do, I read the tale of Li Chao in *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio* and thus recorded this afterward."

He further noted: "Among Zhengnan’s disciples were Seng’er and Sengwei, both monks. Correcting errors."

The theories of "Three Peaks" bedroom arts are often dismissed as vulgar in Daoist elixir manuals, yet these are not the *Mysterious Essentials* of the Patriarch. I once read in the *Mirror of Immortals* that during the Liu-Song dynasty, there was a man named Zhang Shanfeng, styled Boyangzi. Before he entered the Dao, he taught others the methods of bedroom arts to "penetrate the woman’s chamber." The Heavenly Emperor despised this, and he ultimately became a wandering immortal on a grassy isle. The Immortal Lady He Yiyang, while traveling on Mount Hua, once saw his secret golden elixir formulas, all of which he carried on his person. Yet without the Heavenly Edict, he could not ascend to the Jade Palace, and she deeply lamented this. From this, we know that "Shanfeng" (Mountain Peak) was a phonetic corruption of his name. Moreover, the Patriarch’s *Discourse on the Golden Elixir* also states: *"Those who practice the arts of bedroom intercourse are like one who dons hemp to extinguish fire or a moth that dashes into a flame."* Examining this carefully, we see that such criticism is not groundless.

Furthermore, "Three Peaks" is a term for heterodox schools, not limited to Zhang Shanfeng of the Liu-Song era. Within the "yin path," there exists the "Three Peaks" bedroom arts, but the vulgar do not understand this and thus conflate the *Mysterious Essentials* and other heterodox texts, mistaking hearsay for firsthand knowledge—these are those who have never read the elixir classics. The "Three Peaks" arts were already repudiated by the Song-dynasty immortals Zhang Ziyang and Chen Niuwan, and the Patriarch, being a man of the Yuan, need not even address it.

To trace the origins of this art: it is what the *Can Tong Qi* refers to as *"the yin path abhors the nine-and-one."* The error of the "nine-and-one" is precisely the method of bedroom intercourse, dividing the body into upper, middle, and lower "peaks" to absorb others’ essence and qi, falsely styling it as the "Mud-and-Water Golden Elixir." Such practices existed even before [Wei] Boyang. Thus, the *Mysterious Essentials* states: *"The path of effort is not the arts of bedroom intercourse, the techniques of 'lifting and stirring,' or the methods of 'ninefold agitation.'"*

The Patriarch also refuted the errors of the "Three Peaks"—what more need be said? I once read in the *Mirror of Immortals* that Peng Zu was titled the "True Lord of the Three Peaks of Grand Clarity and Radiant Brilliance," yet the arts of bedroom intercourse truly originated with him. His methods of "absorption and supplementation" in the bedchamber led to repeated disasters and marriages. Later, he was imprisoned by the King of Yin, who sought to execute him—this was the Heavenly Law’s judgment. Midway through his captivity, he escaped and entered Mount Hua to return to the true path.

The birthdate of Patriarch Sanfeng, according to the *Biography* composed by Meng Jiu based on his dreams, falls on the ninth day of the fourth month in the second year of Emperor Dingzong of the Yuan. Yet why do various transmitted accounts record it as the eighth day of the third month or the tenth day of the tenth month? Generally, when immortals and buddhas descend into the world, their auspicious dates for attaining the Dao, achieving transcendence, or ascending in flight are manifold. Take the Great Bodhisattva of Mount Putuo or Lord Fuyou—each year, their vegetarian feast days occur nearly every month. Yet those who venerate the Bodhisattva ultimately regard the nineteenth day of the second month as the true date, while those who celebrate Lord Fuyou ultimately hold the fourteenth day of the fourth month as authentic. Here, too, we take the *Biography* as the primary source for the Patriarch’s birthdate, while preserving the rest in the collected records, allowing devotees to offer reverence at any time, just as they do for the feast days of the Bodhisattva and Lord Fuyou—a commendable practice.

Some alternative traditions claim the Patriarch lived between the late Yuan and early Ming, unaware that he was in fact a figure of the late Song and early Yuan. He once recounted to Wan San: *"In the early years of the Yan You era, I was sixty-seven."* Counting backward, this places him precisely in the early years of Emperor Dingzong of the Yuan and the Chun You era of Emperor Lizong of the Song. The Yuan dynasty arose in the north, and the Patriarch, born in Liaodong, was registered in the Yuan census—hence his designation as a man of the Yuan. Wang Zuo’s original *Biography* states that he was born in the *dingwei* year of Emperor Dingzong, aligning with the Patriarch’s own account—truly without error.

Minister Hu Yong’an of the Ming, Hu Ying, sought out Patriarch Sanfeng during the Yongle era, though some mistakenly place this in the Chenghua period. Li Yucun’s *Poetry Talks* records: *"At Xiangfu Temple outside the small west gate of Mianzhu, there is a stele inscribed in the ninth year of the Jiajing era by Wang Rubin, Minister of Rites, with a poem by Hu Ying from the fourth year of the Chenghua era, seeking Zhang Sanfeng."* However, according to the *Ming Annals*, the fifth year of the Yongle era (*dinghai*) was when Hu Ying arrived in Mianzhu. Today, on the wooden wall behind the Hall of the Heavenly Kings, four characters—*"Xiangfu Chan Yuan"*—are inscribed in the Patriarch’s hand, the calligraphy soaring and dynamic. Since *"xiang"* replaces *"xiang"* (祥), might he have once visited this place?

Minister Qian Wenduan, Chen Qun, in his *Fragrant Tree Studio Collection*, includes the poem *"On the Ninth Day of the First Month, Watching Lanterns at Wangxin Village"*, with the lines: *"The immortal, ragged and trailing, arrives in empty azure; / The people stand on swings, gazing at crimson."* The annotation reads: *"Zhang Sanfeng and Qiu Changchun were contemporaries, both later becoming immortals after seeking the Dao."* In my humble opinion, Master Changchun sought the Dao during the Jin dynasty and emerged much earlier—he was not contemporaneous with Patriarch Zhang. However, Immortal Wang’s *Biography* records that during the Patriarch’s reclusive years, a Daoist named Qiu visited him, and after attaining the Dao, the Patriarch roamed the Western Mountains in the early years of the Zhizheng era, where he again encountered Master Changchun, engaging in heartfelt conversation. At that time, Master Qiu was propagating the Dao in the Yuan dynasty, and there were indeed instances of their teachings appearing simultaneously. But to say they sought the Dao together would be incorrect.

Popular versions claim the Patriarch’s original name was Junbao, but upon consulting the *Mirror of Immortals*, I discovered that *"bao"* was originally *"shi"*—a case of the characters for *"lu"* (鲁) and *"yu"* (鱼) being mistaken for one another. Moreover, the two characters *"Junshi"* appear to be a courtesy name rather than a given name. Later, in Lu Yanshan’s *Jottings from the Jade Hall*, I learned that the Patriarch’s name was Tong, his style Xuanyuan, and *"Junshi"* his courtesy name. A descendant of the Heavenly Master, he once resided at Jintai Abbey in Baoji County, Fengxiang. Zhang Chaoyong, Registrar of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices from Nanyang, once met him and observed that his feet never touched the ground. Minister Hu Yong’an later recommended Zhang Chaoyong as Prefect of Junzhou, and together they sought the Patriarch but did not encounter him. There was also a secret imperial edict stating that Wang Zongdao of Huaian had studied immortality with Sanfeng, ordering him to search for the Patriarch and accompany him. After three years, Wang was summoned to court, granted a golden crown and crane-feather robe, and sent with incense and letters to travel the world. Ten years later, he returned without having met the Patriarch.

Further, popular accounts give the Patriarch’s father’s name as *"Zi’an"*, which also seems to be a courtesy name rather than a given name. Upon reading the *Biography* preserved by Meng Jiu, I learned that his father’s name was *"Juren"*, his courtesy name *"Zi’an"*, and his sobriquet *"Baishan."* Among the Daoist manuscripts, there is a *"Confession of Sanfeng"*—clearly a slanderous fabrication, its language vulgar and base, and it must be refuted. The confession states: *"I, Zhang Sanfeng, a novice of over a hundred years—though still called a novice—am twenty-eight years old, a native of Liaoyang. My father is Zhang Zi’an, and I am his fifth son. From childhood, I suffered from eye ailments and was sent to the Jade Palace to become a disciple under Master Fu."*

Later, he once again wandered through Huguang and cultivated his nature and refined his truth at Tianzhu Hermitage in Xiangyang Prefecture. It states: *"Now, by the grace of the Yongle Emperor’s esteemed invitation to honor Daoist teachings, I can no longer conceal the truth, and what I have confessed is real."* This was clearly fabricated by fangshi and Daoist adepts to seek glory, yet they unwittingly slandered him instead. During the Yongle era, our Patriarch remained deeply secluded, as even the *Ming History* attests—how could he have submitted a confession to the court, self-promoting and parading before the imperial gates? Even the *Immortal’s Mirror* records his ascension in the Golden Hall, but this was merely a brief moment of discourse to demonstrate the indestructibility of the yang spirit. Later, upon examining Meng Jiu’s authentic copy, I found only a memorial from Hu Guang, and my long-standing doubts were finally resolved.

**Appendix: Memorial from Hu Guang**
The Memorial of Your Servant, Hu Guang, Academician Reader-in-waiting, humbly states: The perfected immortal Zhang Sanfeng was a native of Liaodong. Profound in Daoist arts and endowed with divine powers, he dwelled in reclusion on Mount Wudang, embodying the spirit of Chen Tuan. He may be reverently sought, but his presence cannot be commanded. With the Emperor’s august journey to emulate Guangchengzi in seeking the true Dao, your servant dared not conceal the truth and thus respectfully submitted this memorial.

There is also *A Brief Record of the Western Ocean*, which recounts the tale of Jin Bifeng’s visit to Nanjing to seek the Patriarch. It claims the Patriarch’s name was *Shoucheng*, a native of Jurong, who once served as a clerk in the county yamen before abandoning his brush to become a Daoist at the Chaotian Palace in Xishan Daoist Monastery. Through cultivation, he attained the rank of earthly immortal. Bifeng, ordered to seek out Minister Hu, presented him to the enlightened sovereign, who proclaimed him a celestial immortal, thereby confirming his ascent to the Great Luo Heaven. This is merely a novelist’s embellishment using borrowed names—nothing more than fiction.

Some may ask: Why was he called *Shoucheng* and said to be from Jurong? The answer: Without such details, the stage would lack its requisite dialogue and cues. Between the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the Patriarch authored many works. His poetry is collected in *Cloud and Water Anthology*, and his prose comprises several pieces, all preserved in Meng Jiu’s collection.

The *Mirror of Immortals* further records that Hu Guang presented the Patriarch’s Daoist poems, titled *Essentials of Swift Attainment*, including works such as *"The Rootless Tree,"* *"Song of the Great Dao,"* *"Song of Lead Refinement,"* *"Poem of the Jade Flower,"* two stanzas of *"Lichun Courtyard,"* *"Inscription Left at Qingyang Palace,"* *"Song of Golden Elixir’s Return,"* and *"Song of the Perfected Immortal’s Dao Attainment."* In recent times, transmitted copies have become increasingly muddled. For instance, the *Mysterious Essentials* carved by Zhang Lingji of Xiangyun Cave and Deng Lingmi originally contained *"Thirty-Six Poems on the Golden Elixir"* to symbolize the 360 degrees of the celestial sphere, but these have been reduced to sixteen, with the rest scattered and disordered. All Daoist sentiments have been excluded from publication, as the compilers evidently never saw the complete collection. Some common manuscripts surpass the Zhang and Deng editions in comprehensiveness but mistakenly include poems by Lü Dongbin. This compilation has been meticulously gathered and cross-referenced with Meng Jiu’s authentic copy, striving to restore its original form. Would the Patriarch approve?

Respectfully noted by Chang Yi. **Category: Manifestations**

Shen Wansan of the Ferry

Shen Wansan was a great fisherman of Qinhuai. Kind-hearted and fond of charity, he initially lived in modest comfort. In the nineteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he suddenly encountered a Daoist immortal—his bearing lofty, his form like a tortoise, his bones like a crane’s, with large ears, round eyes, and a height exceeding seven feet, his long beard bristling like a halberd. He wore a crescent moon cap, carried a blade and measuring rule, and donned a bamboo hat and patched robe through all seasons, never adorning his appearance. He could travel over a thousand *li* in a day, consuming a *sheng* or *dou* of food at a time, or fasting for months on end while his countenance grew ever more radiant.

Wansan found him extraordinary and often simmered fresh fish and warmed wine, inviting him to drink on the reed islets. Whatever the immortal needed, Wansan supplied to the utmost. One evening, as they drank beneath the moon, the immortal asked, *"Do you wish to know my origins?"* Wansan respectfully entreated him, whereupon the immortal tossed back his beard and laughed, *"I am Zhang Sanfeng."* He then recounted the tale of his mundane and transcendent existence, his cultivation and attainment of the Dao, before bursting into hearty laughter.

Hearing this, Wansan prostrated himself in reverence, calling him *"Patriarch,"* and begged for instruction. *"This humble one’s wish is only to relieve suffering,"* he said. *"I dare not hope for wealth or longevity."* The Patriarch replied, *"Though I dare not recklessly transmit the true teaching, neither do I wish to seal the Dao in silence. I have long seen into your heart—let me act on your behalf."*

Thereupon, they prepared medicinal ingredients and chose an auspicious day to begin the refinement. After forty-nine days, when they opened the crucible, the lead and mercury had each followed their own course. The Patriarch sighed in dismay, while Wansan blamed his own lack of karmic affinity. He exhausted his savings and even sold his boats and nets to fund the work. Midway through, the mercury suddenly flared like wildfire, burning away the thatched roof. Wansan lamented his meager fortune, and the Patriarch urged him to abandon the effort. Yet the couple bore no resentment and insisted on continuing, though their resources were depleted. They even considered selling their young daughter. The Patriarch feigned ignorance, secretly pleased by their resolve, and allowed them to proceed.

He then instructed them to prepare cinnabar-coated mercury. Summoning the couple before him, he took a small amount of the elixir, flicked a speck from his fingernail into the heated mercury, which instantly congealed like earth. With dead mercury, he transmuted copper coins into silver and gold, promising them longevity. The Patriarch then gathered a portion of the elixir’s essence and, before departing, advised, *"The *qi* of royal destiny surges in the southeast. We shall meet again in the southwest."* He then entered the Ba region.

With this, Wansan established his family’s fortune. He set up a furnace and refined the elixir on a grand scale, becoming the wealthiest man in the world within a year. Whenever he encountered the poor or distressed, he generously provided for them. Merchants borrowed his capital to trade, and his influence spread across the land. The world called him the possessor of a *"treasure-gathering basin,"* for his wealth flowed inexhaustibly.

At that time, the world was in chaos, ravaged by war. Fearing calamity, Wansan destroyed his alchemical furnace and utensils, styling himself the *"Daoist of Three Mountains."* To this day, the street in the southwest of Nanjing City marks his later residence. The Huìtóng Inn stands on the site of his former home, and the land by the rear lake was once his garden.

*The Immortals’ Mirror* remarks: "The completion of the external elixir aids the internal elixir." Yet the true Dao is rarely heard of, and for every thousand attempts, there are ten thousand failures. People often invoke [Zhang] Sanfeng’s name, but most are deceived without realizing it. One must first possess the vast fortune of ten thousand mountains before encountering such a path—otherwise, it is best to set it aside.

**Dwelling at Jintai Abbey**
In the *bingwu* year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan (1366), at Jintai Abbey in Baoji, there lived an elderly Daoist whose appearance suggested over a hundred years. On the twenty-seventh day of the ninth month, he suddenly announced his departure from the world, left a verse, and passed away. The scholar and commoner Yang Guishan prepared a coffin and completed the encoffining. As the casket was about to be interred, a sound like thunder erupted, and the lid burst open—he revived, leaping up to address Guishan: "I am Zhang Sanfeng. A descendant of the Celestial Masters, I devoted myself to the Dao from youth. Now my great elixir is complete, and my spirit roams the celestial seas. You, sir, are a good man—rare indeed, rare indeed!" He then taught Guishan the arts of evading the world and prolonging life, and soon after, took him away together.

Yuántōngzǐ observed: "If all in the world were like Guishan, no bones would lie exposed on the roads. Such a compassionate man—how could the immortals not ferry him across?"

**Concealed on Mount Taihe**
At the beginning of the Hongwu era (1368), the Patriarch [Zhang Sanfeng] entered Mount Taihe and built a hut beside Yuxu Palace, where he sat in cold meditation. Before the hut stood five ancient trees, their shade spanning several *mu*, their canopies wreathed in mist. He often rested beneath them, where fierce beasts did not devour and birds of prey did not strike. People marveled at him, calling him "Tattered Zhang" for his filthy, ragged robes. When asked about immortal arts, he never answered, but if questioned on the classics, he discoursed endlessly. He ascended mountains with the lightness of flight, and in the depths of winter, he slept in the snow, snoring like thunder. He often told the villagers of Taihe: "This mountain shall one day achieve great renown."

The Daoist Qiu Yuanjing inquired about his origins and only then recognized him as the Patriarch Sanfeng. He begged to become his disciple, and Sanfeng transmitted to him the wondrous arts of the Dao.

*The Mirror of Divine Immortals* comments: "Heretical and peripheral teachings most easily delude people—like arrows shot into empty space, they inevitably fall back to earth. Only by finding the true seed, cultivating in secret, and refining until the elixir is complete and the fruit ripe, can one become impervious to cold and heat, beyond the reach of yin and yang, moving freely and coming and going at will. This is the true attainment." Those like Sanfeng are worthy of reverence.

**Letter to Chang Yuchun**
In the sixth month of the *jiyou* year of the Hongwu era (1369), Chang Yuchun advanced on Daxing Prefecture, captured Kaiping, and pursued the fleeing enemy for hundreds of *li*, achieving total victory and pacifying the north of Ji. In the seventh month, his army reached Liuhe Prefecture, where Yuchun fell ill. He addressed his generals: "When I was born, an old man came to my door and handed me a letter, saying: *'Radiant Tail Star, mighty tiger minister, harmonious meeting with the lord, beneath the willows the spirit returns.'* The envelope read: *'A letter from Zhang Zhenren Sanfeng of Wutai.'* These same words appear again—now that I have reached Liuhe Prefecture and fallen ill, I know my end has come." Soon after, he died in the army camp at the age of thirty-four.

The previous year, in *wushen* (1368), when the Emperor had just ascended the throne, he had respectfully inquired of the forty-second-generation Celestial Master, Zhang Chongxu: "What of the northern campaign?" The Celestial Master replied: "The court is blessed; the great general shall return to the Dao."

The Prince of Shu, Chun—twelfth son of the Grand Progenitor, enfeoffed as Prince of Shu—was also named Chun (or sometimes mistakenly recorded as Cao). During the Hongwu reign, the Grand Progenitor invested his son Chun as Prince of Shu. At that time, the Two Rivers region had long been pacified, its people tranquil and flourishing. Suddenly, an old man appeared, his spirit whole and visage ancient, moving as swiftly as if he flew. One day, clad in a formal cap and broad sash, he appeared before the prince with graceful ease and spoke of entering the Dao. The prince did not heed him, yet marveled inwardly at the elder’s vigor and wished to retain him. The old man laughed and recited:

*"Why seek the swift path of Zhongnan’s peaks?
To me, your longing weighs no more than goose down."*

The prince esteemed his resolve. One day, the old man said to him: *"Though your fief is fine, you must cultivate a retiring heart and empty mind to preserve yourself from misfortune. I am Zhang Sanfeng. Soon I shall wander the vast expanse with the immortals of the sea isles."* The prince composed a poem to send him off, including the lines:

*"My master has deeply grasped the art of the Marquis of Liu,
Nurturing stillness in the cinnabar field to guard the Valley Spirit."*

He did not detain him, and the Patriarch departed. Some say that among the later princes—such as Prince Gu, Sui, and Prince Liao, Zhi—many failed to retain their fiefs, while the Prince of Shu alone dwelled in peace and prosperity, all thanks to the Patriarch’s counsel.

After meeting the Prince of Shu, Chun, the Patriarch roamed the vast lands of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, his cloud chariot unbound by fixed abode, his manifest traces most numerous, never lingering in stillness upon any single mountain. Some claim that upon first entering Chengdu and finding the Prince of Shu indifferent to the Dao, he withdrew to the Xiang-Ye region, dwelling on Mount Wudang for twenty-three years before one day setting forth on his wanderings, departing with a flick of his sleeve.

Yuantongzi, reading this passage, inscribed a quatrain:

*A white-haired immortal once entered the tent,
Met yet unrecognized—what could be done?
A few weighty words to the prince he imparted,
Preserving his fief in abundant repose.*

In the Hongwu reign, the Patriarch traveled to Shu and lodged at the residence of Commander Jiang of the Imperial Guards. His movements were enigmatic, yet none recognized him. He always wore a broad-brimmed bamboo hat, so large that it passed unimpeded even through narrow doorways, fastened with an iron-wire cord of exquisite workmanship. From dawn to dusk, he sat upon a flat boulder, and once, breaking a withered plum branch and planting it in the earth, it took root at once, its blossoms all drooping downward—hence the old name in Chengdu for such trees: "Water-Reflecting Plum."

At the Kaiyuan Monastery in Kuizhou’s western city, the former abode of Chan Master Liaoxiu of the Tang, the Patriarch arrived in the early Ming. Befriending the monk Guanghai, he stayed at the monastery for seven days. Upon parting, he presented a poem and left behind a pair of straw sandals and three pieces of aloeswood. Later, Guanghai offered the poem and these two items to Emperor Wen, who in return bestowed a jade ring and a *kāṣāya* embroidered with a thousand Buddhas. These remain enshrined in the monastery as treasures of the age.

Recorded in the *Gazetteer of Chengdu Prefecture* and the *Gazetteer of Kuizhou Prefecture*.

Three Times Declining the Imperial Summons.

In the seventeenth year of the Hongwu reign (1414), the Jiazi cyclical year, the Emperor, with all under heaven—both Chinese and foreign—having submitted, issued an edict to seek the Perfected One Zhang Sanfeng, yet none knew his whereabouts. The following spring, the court again pressed his disciple Shen Wansan to urge him, but he remained unattainable. The Emperor then summoned Qiu Yuanzhen to court. The Patriarch thereupon presented a poem and instructed Qiu, saying: *"Tell the Radiant Son of Heaven that I shall soon roam beyond the seas."* The poem read:

*"Flowing waters and drifting clouds heed no restraint,
Why must the court so earnestly pursue?
Henceforth I shall conceal my name and surname,
Roaming freely north and south of the mountains."*

The Emperor read it and released him. Soon after, he offered Qiu the post of Surveillance Commissioner and bestowed fine residences, all of which Qiu declined. Truly, he did not forget his master’s teachings. The *Mirror of Immortals* records the three imperial summons but omits the poem. Yuantongzi remarked: *"Was Yan Ziling not my master’s former incarnation?"*

**The Yunnan Rendezvous**
During the Hongwu reign, the city walls from Hongwu Gate to Shuixi Gate in the capital collapsed. Beneath them lurked a water spirit in its lair; every attempt to rebuild them crumbled anew. The Emperor, long resentful of Shen Wansan—whose age matched his own and whose wealth was vast—summoned him and said: *"Your household possesses a basin that gathers treasures. Can it also gather earth to rebuild this gate?"* Wansan dared not refuse. He accepted the command and began construction, but the foundations collapsed thrice. Only after secretly casting several pieces of cinnabar-gold into the earth did the walls stand firm, at a cost of untold thousands.

Once, the Emperor wished to reward the troops and summoned Wansan to lend him funds. *"My army numbers a million,"* he said. *"If each soldier receives but one tael, that will suffice."* Wansan delivered the sum in full. The Emperor, observing no sign of hardship in him, resolved to eliminate him, charging him on other grounds and sentencing him to exile in Lingnan. Wansan then abandoned his wealth, taking only his wife and servants, and fled, leaving his family’s fortune behind.

Before long, the decree came to banish him further to Yunnan. Upon arriving in Dian, Wansan, despondent, suddenly heard of an elder with the surname Gongchang who claimed: *"I have come to keep our appointment."* Wansan requested an audience and found it was none other than Patriarch Sanfeng. The Patriarch laughed: *"Do you still recall my words about the flourishing qi in the southeast and our meeting in the southwest?"* Wansan was enlightened. Thereupon, he practiced the *Tianyuan* alchemical arts and ingested the Great Elixir. By the following year, he had succeeded. Wansan and his entire household consumed it and all ascended as immortals.

Yuantongzi remarked: *"To cast aside wealth is to become a transcendent—his beneficence was already great."*

**Roaming Crane Cry Mountain**

In the final years of the Hongwu reign, a Daoist wandered to Crane Cry Mountain in Qiong. The mountain had twenty-four caves, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. When the Daoist entered the mountain, stone cranes cried out again, and all who witnessed it were astonished. After residing there for half a year, he entered Heavenly Valley Cave and did not emerge. On the cave door were inscribed four characters: *"Sanfeng roamed here."* At that time, he was already over a hundred years old. The *Comprehensive Gazetteer of Shu* records it as over three hundred years, which seems erroneous.

Yuántōngzǐ remarked: *"How extraordinary!"*

**A Poem to Warn of Disaster**
At the beginning of Emperor Jianwen’s reign, as dusk fell at the Ministry of Revenue’s gate, an old man strolled leisurely, resembling a local earth deity. When the wind passed, he suddenly vanished. The next morning, upon inspecting the double doors, a poem was found inscribed on the right panel:

*"Swallows build their nests in the pavilion,
The dragon’s heir is not in the deep.
Waves calm, yet winds rise again,
On the sea, inquire of the Three Threes."*

The last three characters were written at the meeting point of the double doors, leaving many perplexed. Zhuo, the Vice Minister of Revenue, saw it and realized that the three characters written across the door formed the central stroke of the character *fēng* (丰), signifying that it was the immortal Sanfeng. He also understood that *"swallows"* referred to the Prince of Yan, and *"dragon’s heir"* to Jianwen. The words were ominous, and the characters soon fell away. Zhuo secretly memorialized the throne, proposing to relocate and confine the Prince of Yan to Nanchang, so that if any upheaval occurred, it could still be controlled. However, his memorial was disregarded.

Yuántōngzǐ remarked: *"Vice Minister Zhuo was keen and admirable, yet loyal words grated on the ear, leading to the Prince of Yan’s usurpation. Was my master also compelled to inscribe this poem, or did he not already know that Jianwen would not heed the warning?"*

In the early years of the Yongle reign, a wandering scholar roamed the capital. His bearing was refined and lofty, his beard long and flowing, yet his attire and demeanor resembled that of a common traveler. He stayed in the capital for quite some time and formed a close bond with Hu Ying, a Supervising Secretary in the Office of Scrutiny for the Household. They often gathered for poetry and wine. The scholar enjoyed composing imitations of *Wen Xuan* but rarely kept drafts. When he heard that officials in the court, after finishing their duties, idly discussed matters of immortals and transcendents—and that the Reader-in-Waiting Hu Guang intended to recommend Zhang Sanfeng’s arts of immortality to the throne—he grew disdainful. One day, while drinking in Hu Ying’s study, he suddenly said, *"My friend serves a wise ruler well, but I shall withdraw deep into the mountains."* Startled, Hu Ying pressed him for the reason, but the scholar remained silent. After repeated questioning, he finally lifted his beard and laughed, *"I am Sanfeng."* With that, he departed abruptly, vanishing without a trace. Later, Hu Ying sought the Master Sanfeng and composed the lines: *"I recall my old friend who vanished thus—who now writes poems like Bao Canjun?"*

**A Single Encounter**
In the winter of the fourth year of Yongle, Zhang Chaoyong, a Registrar in the Court of the Imperial Stud from Nanyang, once saw a Daoist whose movements were extraordinary—his feet never touched the ground, his fingers twirled plum blossoms, and his lips murmured verses of *Autumn Waters*. Stepping forward to inquire, he discovered it was the immortal Sanfeng. The following year, the emperor ordered Hu Ying to search for him, and Hu recommended Zhang Chaoyong to accompany him, but Sanfeng had already vanished.

**Revealing the Way to Mingyu**
During the Yongle era, a Daoist traveler stayed in Neijiang at the home of the Daoist Mingyu. He claimed the surname Pang and subtly displayed his marvels—walking perilous heights without falling, wading through water without getting wet. Mingyu, skilled in talismans and incantations with many proven wonders, wished to transmit his arts to the traveler. The traveler smiled and said, *"I offer you the Way as tribute; how can you teach me your methods?"* He then presented Mingyu with a scroll titled *Memorial on the Convergence of Dao and Method*. Mingyu was astonished, knelt, and begged for his name, only then learning he was the Venerable Sanfeng. After residing there for over a year, Hu Ying tracked him down, but he would not stay. (The *Sichuan Gazetteer* records that he appeared before Hu with Mingyu, which contradicts the *Ming Records*; here, the latter is followed as correct.) Later, he wandered in and out of Mount Emei.

**Ascending in Broad Daylight at the Ming Palace**

Emperor Chengzu of the Ming, after encountering the Western monk Halima, began to nurture an inclination toward the Dao. Minister Hu Guang spoke of Zhang Sanfeng as one truly possessed of the Dao and its methods, presenting his *Essentials of Swift Attainment* for the Emperor’s perusal. Though the depths of Sanfeng’s mastery remained unfathomable, the Emperor sensed its resonance with profound mystery and dispatched envoys to seek him out.

In the spring of the *renchen* year, he further commanded Sun Biyun to journey to Mount Wudang to pay respects. On the sixth day of the third month, a letter was bestowed upon him. Three years later, Sun Biyun finally arrived at Wudang and presented the imperial missive. The Venerable Master read it, smiled, and replied with a single scroll. Biyun urged him to attend court, but Sanfeng would not remain indoors; when he ventured out, Biyun accompanied him, sending word to the Emperor.

In the spring of the *bingshen* year, the Emperor ordered a carriage to welcome him, yet Sanfeng had already departed elsewhere. The Emperor then reprimanded Hu Guang for his search, and Guang, greatly alarmed, hastened to Wudang to plead earnestly. Moved by his sincerity, the Venerable Master agreed to appear at court. He first vanished in a flight of his own, while the Emperor, seated in audience, suddenly beheld a tattered Daoist in a deerskin cloak standing before the steps, bowing with a cold smile. When asked if he was Sanfeng, the Emperor warmly invited him to sit and sought discourse on the Dao. The Venerable Master then chanted the tune *"Seeking the Dao and the Mysterious, I’ve Traversed the Ends of the Earth."* As the melody concluded, he descended the steps with unhurried grace. Suddenly, auspicious clouds and mist filled the palace hall, lingering for a long while before dispersing—Sanfeng was gone. The Emperor and his ministers marveled, now convinced of his true immortality. Upon Hu Guang’s return to court, the Emperor bestowed generous rewards upon him.

According to the *Ming Records*, in the *dinghai* year, the Emperor commanded Hu Ying and others to search for Sanfeng far and wide, returning only after a decade. Counting sequentially from *dinghai* to *bingshen* spans precisely ten years, during which, in the fifth month, the audience with the Emperor occurred. It remains unclear whether Ying and his party returned before or after the fifth month; if after, their paths would have crossed in vain.

The *Mirror of Immortals* comments: Some attain the Dao through marrow-washing and bone-changing without shedding their forms; others nurture an infant spirit to manifest their divine essence; still others refine their bodies in the Great Yin to achieve liberation through apparent death. All these serve as proofs of the Way. Yet the perfection of the unhewn jade in nurturing the fetal spirit, or Sanfeng’s ascension from the golden hall, could not have been achieved without rebalancing the Nine Cauldrons and reestablishing the cosmos. Thus viewed, the alchemical Dao is no trifling matter.

**Manifestations of Mysterious Radiance**
On the first day of the fifth month in the *bingshen* year of the Yongle reign, a grand assembly was held in honor of the Southern Pole Elder’s longevity. The Lord Lao commanded Yin Zhenren of the Grand Tenuity to transmit his decree to the assembled immortals. As Yin gazed northwest, he beheld a cluster of mysterious radiance descending from the sky. Drawing near, he saw it was Master Sanfeng. Yin conveyed the Lord Lao’s command, to which Sanfeng replied, *"I have already received the Jade Emperor’s summons."* With that, he departed. The Seven-Needle Master.

During the Tianshun era, there was a figure known as the Seven-Needle Master. He often carried seven medicinal needles to treat people’s sores and ailments, achieving many remarkable cures, and so people called him by this name. The Master also adopted it as his own. Skilled in painting landscapes, he soon gained the esteem of officials and nobles. Earlier, Zhang Sanfeng had been renowned for his immortal paintings, which the court repeatedly sought but failed to obtain. A court minister then brought the Seven-Needle Master to the emperor’s attention, and upon imperial summons, he presented a landscape painting that greatly pleased His Majesty. However, the Master was fond of wine and prone to cursing the powerful and favored. A corrupt official, coveting his skill, invited him to his home with lavish hospitality, hoping to secure paintings for personal gain.

One day, the emperor again bestowed fine silk for him to paint. By then, the Seven-Needle Master was drunk, lodging in a small attic. The corrupt official handed him the silk, which the Master left by his bedside. That night, the sound of violent retching filled the room. Anxious, the official lit a candle and saw the Master leap up, exclaiming, *"How exhilarating! How exhilarating!"* Looking around, he found sparrows hopping about, nearly ready to take flight—only their eyes remained unpainted. The official had no choice but to present the work to the emperor, who marveled at it and ordered the eyes be finished. The Master replied, *"If I paint the eyes, they will fly away."* The emperor did not believe him and pressed him. The Seven-Needle Master then took up his brush and hastily dashed in the eyes. The emperor, amused, remarked, *"Do these creatures truly wish to fly?"* As he spoke, countless sparrows soared into the clouds and vanished. They descended upon the corrupt official’s homeland, pecking every grain from his fields until not a single stalk remained—yet the neighboring lands were untouched.

The Seven-Needle Master also vanished. When the emperor learned of the affair, he issued another summons, but the Master could not be found. The emperor then consulted Minister of Rites Hu Ying, who replied, *"Could the Seven-Needle Master be Sanfeng in disguise? If you examine the characters for ‘Sanfeng’ (三丰) horizontally and vertically, they resemble seven needles (七针)."* The emperor was astonished. He posthumously honored him as the *"Master of Glutinous Rice Dumplings."*

During the Tianshun era, in Jianzhou, there lived an elderly man whose surname was forgotten. He made his living by selling glutinous rice dumplings daily. Whenever he saw a poor person pass by, he would give them a packet without asking for payment. If someone inquired about his reason, the old man would say, *"These are all weary travelers, their bellies empty. I sell dumplings each day only to secure my capital and earn a modest profit—this is enough. To share the rest with others is but a small kindness; why speak of it?"*

One day, as dusk approached, he had not sold all his dumplings. Suddenly, a Daoist passed by and begged for a packet. The old man gave him one, and after eating it, the Daoist asked for another. This happened dozens of times, and each time, the old man obliged. The Daoist laughed heartily and said, *"You are truly generous. I have no other skill, but in my pouch is a single purple pearl. Take it home and place it in your rice jar. When you open it the next evening, you will find something wondrous."* With that, the Daoist vanished like the wind.

The old man took the pearl home and did as instructed. At the time, his rice jar was nearly empty. The next morning, he opened it to find the jar full of rice. He smiled and said, *"So this is the ‘wondrous’ thing the Daoist spoke of."* He then used the rice to make dumplings, selling three parts and giving away seven. The next day, the jar was full again. He continued his work as usual, and those who benefited from his kindness all praised him with admiration.

Over time, the old man grew curious. He overturned the jar to inspect it, and the purple pearl was gone. From then on, the jar no longer produced rice. Some days later, the Daoist returned and said to him, *"I am so-and-so. You have shown great kindness. Would you like to transcend the world?"* The old man refused. The Patriarch then took out a pill and instructed, *"Eat this, and your lifespan will be extended."* The old man swallowed it and felt his chest and abdomen clear. After the Patriarch left, the old man lived to over a hundred years before passing away in perfect repose.

Master Yuantong remarked, *"It is a pity this old man did not seek the Daoist Way, yet his heart brimmed with compassion—surely he was destined for a long life."*

During the Chenghua era, occult masters flourished for a time, granted imperial patents and styled as "Perfected Ones" until nearly the entire capital was filled with them. Among them was the Western barbarian monk Zaba, who firmly propagated esoteric teachings and was favored with the title "Buddha of Great Wisdom." He rode in a lofty palanquin, and even high officials would clear the streets before his processional escort. One day, as Zaba returned to his bestowed residence, he suddenly saw a ragged Daoist inscribe a poem upon the mirrored wall:

*"Occult masters swarm the court in throngs,
A barbarian monk now overshadows the mighty.
Such slaves dare claim the names of Dao and Buddha—
The Venerable Lord smiles, the World-Honored One admonishes."*

The signature read: *"Broken Kun hexagram, supplemented."* Zaba, enraged upon seeing this, ordered his soldiers to seize the Daoist, but as dust and wind arose, the Daoist vanished. Some said, *"The broken Kun hexagram with supplementation forms the character 'feng'—thus all knew it was the true immortal Sanfeng."* Thereafter, Zaba’s influence gradually waned.

Master Yuantong remarked, *"Zaba lost face."*

In the Chenghua era, Daoist priests swarmed and bustled, entering and exiting the imperial court. The Patriarch deeply detested them. One day, encountering two alchemists surnamed Zhao and Wang, he knew their hearts harbored deceit and that they would soon journey north, wielding strange arts. Thus, he transformed into the guise of a religious master and deceived them, saying, *"I am Celestial Master Zhang. My flying talismans summon spirits—my methods are most efficacious. Would you two wish to learn?"* Zhao and Wang did not believe him. The Patriarch then traced symbols in the air, and suddenly, heavenly soldiers and generals appeared amidst the swirling clouds. The two men, astonished, knelt to beg for talismans. The Patriarch feigned secrecy as he instructed them, bestowing several talismans. The two laughed heartily as they departed.

At that time, Li Zixing had gained the emperor’s favor through the Five Thunder Rites. The two alchemists sought him out and thereby advanced their position. When the emperor inquired of their abilities, they replied that the Celestial Master had transmitted the talismans to them and requested the emperor to observe a three-day fast before witnessing their arts. The emperor followed their instructions. On the appointed day, a grand altar was erected, but after a full day of pretense, no magic manifested. Enraged by their deceit, the emperor ordered his guards to execute them on the spot.

Master Yuantong remarked, *"The true immortal’s loathing of alchemists is like a gentleman’s disdain for petty men. My master’s sevenfold mockery of alchemists used the orthodox Dharma to toy with heterodox arts, ensuring that all such sorcery would fail and their favor at court would wane. One such as my master should be enfeoffed as the Heavenly Master Who Sweeps Away Evil and Upholds Righteousness to Protect the State. Later, in the final years of the Chenghua era, the titles of Buddhist monks and Daoist priests were revoked—though this was at the urging of the Censorate, who can say it was not because my master had covertly exposed their arts, leading to their dismissal?"* The following six accounts should be viewed in this light.

**The Second Mockery of Alchemists**
The Patriarch once wagered with an alchemist surnamed Liu to command ghosts and spirits. When the alchemist first burned his talisman, the Patriarch secretly obscured it with his own power. When it came to the Patriarch’s turn, countless spirits and demons—fierce armored steeds and grotesque apparitions—appeared in the sky. The alchemist, astonished, knelt to beg for instruction. The Patriarch generously taught him, even revealing the wondrous method of beheading ghosts. Overjoyed, the alchemist carried his skills to the capital, where they were praised as highly effective—though he never employed the ghost-slaying technique.

Later, through the influence of Liang Fang and others, he gained entry to the inner court. One night, as a eunuch dallied with a palace maid, the emperor ordered Liu to burn a ghost-summoning talisman. Two ghosts arrived—a man and a woman—who flirted beneath the palace tower, gradually drawing near the emperor without reverence. Terrified, the emperor commanded Liu to draw his sword and strike them, only to discover they were the palace maid Yun’e and a certain eunuch. Enraged, the emperor deemed Liu’s actions an insult and had him executed on the spot.

Master Yuantong remarked, *"One talisman slew three evils—not because my master wielded a cruel hand, but because upholding righteousness to protect the state is true compassion."*

The fangshi Guo Chengxian was a rogue and a knave. Initially, he had some success with the Five Thunder Method and was on his way to the capital when Master Sanfeng intercepted him along the road. They met by the wayside, and the master concealed his true identity, calling himself the "Rival Celestial Master." He addressed Guo first: *"Do you carry the Five Thunder Formula on your person?"* Guo, astonished by his prescience, surmised he must be a divine being and dared not conceal the truth, answering repeatedly in the affirmative.

The Rival Celestial Master said, *"I possess an even greater Six Thunder Method to bestow upon you. Follow its practices, and you will be able to summon celestial maidens and ride the phoenix through the mortal realm. Recently, Li Zixing has wielded power both within and beyond the court. Present this method to him, and high office will be yours in an instant."* Guo rejoiced and begged to receive the transmission. After kowtowing in gratitude, he departed and sought out Li Zixing. First, he employed the Five Thunder Method before Zixing to gain his trust as a fellow practitioner.

Guo laughed and said, *"This is but a trifle. I possess the Six Thunder Method as well. The one who transmitted it to me said, ‘This method can summon celestial beauties.’"* Zixing leapt with excitement and urged Guo to demonstrate it. Guo, feigning importance, ordered an elaborate altar prepared—adorned with crimson lanterns and emerald curtains, transforming the setting entirely. Zixing’s concubines, dressed in their finest, leaned against the pavilion railings to witness Guo’s art.

Guo then followed the method, tracing talismans and circling the altar while chanting incantations. Sure enough, four or five celestial maidens descended gracefully, each riding a crimson serpent, and alighted upon the altar. Among them, two women were especially enchanting. Their twin voices wove a melody, clear as orioles, singing:

*"My lord holds the pass,
Discards his robes of office for crimson skirts.
This power, this fortune—how fleeting!
Leaning on the railing at dawn,
Tears stain the clouds’ song."*

The tune was crisp and delicate, at once mocking and admonishing, fearful and mournful. Zixing’s followers, at first captivated by the beauties, grew bewildered upon hearing the lyrics. The deeper they pondered their meaning, the more their dread mounted.

Suddenly, thunder and rain erupted in the sky, and windblown sand swirled violently. All the lanterns on the altar were extinguished, plunging the scene into chaos—fox dens and rat burrows seemed to collapse in a deluge of smoke and water. In an instant, the clouds dispersed, and a slender moon hung from the eaves. A groan arose from the depths of the darkened altar. When torches were relit, they revealed several of Zixing’s concubines, each straddling a dazed man, their naked bodies bent as if in a stupor. Upon closer inspection, these men were none other than the fangshi and disciples Zixing kept in his household.

Servants were forced to drag them away. When they searched for Guo Chengxian, he was still standing before the altar, muttering incoherent incantations, shaking his head, and counting on his fingers as if immensely pleased with himself. Overcome with shame and fury, Zixing drew his sword and struck him down, casting his corpse into the pond behind the garden. He forbade his household from speaking of the matter, yet that very night, the scandal spread far and wide. Zixing grew ever more uneasy, his terror deepening.

Master Yuantong remarked, *"The Six Thunder Method proves wondrous indeed—though I know not from whence my master obtained it. In the heyday of Han and Tang fangshi, such a text would have been invaluable."*

The Four Charlatans Fangshi

Peng Hua, having risen to the position of Vice Minister of Personnel, subsequently allied himself with Wan’an’s Zixing and thus gained entry into the Grand Secretariat, where he took part in the deliberations of state affairs. His power and influence grew daily, and he wielded authority as he pleased, banishing loyal officials and filling his household with fangshi.

One day, afflicted by a fever that proved resistant to cooling medicines, he ordered the fangshi Xiong Zhong to seek out a skilled physician. Xiong heard that beyond the capital gates there lived a certain individual well-versed in the arts of Qi Bo and the Yellow Emperor, so he set out to summon him. Along the way, he encountered a Daoist priest carrying a medicine satchel on his back and a painting board in hand, upon which were inscribed four lines:

*A single sheet of plaster,
mends wounds and sores.
Three doses of the Great Elixir,
ensnare the arts of fangshi.*

What was called "one sheet and three doses" was in fact a veiled reference to the priest’s own name. Taking it as a display of his medical prowess, Xiong paid it no further heed. The priest offered fever-relieving pills for sale, but when Xiong sought to purchase them, the priest deliberately inflated his price, claiming that his pills not only cured illness but also lightened the body. When Xiong expressed doubt, the priest swallowed one himself and hovered several feet above the ground without support. Xiong immediately prostrated himself, begging to buy a pill. The priest then cautioned, *"If consumed by a man of great nobility, this pill will enable him to ascend to the heavens in broad daylight. After his departure, securing a high position will be effortless."* Xiong, harboring no aspirations for immortality, merely wished to join the ranks of men like Peng Hua, holding power in key offices. He returned with the pill and recounted its marvels. Peng Hua, in his feverish delirium, swallowed it whole. His head soon throbbed as if poisoned, and he retched violently before succumbing to a wind-induced ailment. Xiong, seizing the opportunity, fled, and Peng Hua was later dismissed from office due to his illness.

Master Yuantong remarked, *"Fever rooted in the heart is difficult to cure with cooling remedies. Only by inducing vomiting to expel the fire and then afflicting him with wind could the heat in his heart be dispelled. As for the fangshi—his own heart burned far hotter than Peng Hua’s. Disdaining immortality, he craved only wealth and rank. Why wait for his master to ascend before fleeing?"*

The Five Charlatans Fangshi

In the western mountains of Taihang, there lived an immortal named Master Ma, famed for his divine arrows that could slay ghosts—many sought his aid, and none failed to see results. Daoist Deng Chang’en, who had long heard of his prowess, became a Minister of Rites and, being treacherous and ruthless, secretly murdered a man. Thereafter, the victim’s spirit haunted his residence as a malevolent force.

Deng dispatched his disciple Chen Wai’er to seek Master Ma’s art. On the road, Chen encountered a Daoist of towering bearing, bow drawn taut in hand, seven swords and three talismans at his waist. The stranger claimed to strike ghosts with unerring accuracy but refused to give his name. Suspicious, Chen traveled with him until dusk, when they took shelter in a ruined temple. As twilight deepened beneath the blackened boughs of ancient trees, ghostly wails arose. Terrified, Chen watched as the Daoist drew his bow through a crack in the window and loosed an arrow—the specter shrieked and fled. Chen, now filled with awe, begged to learn the skill the next morning. The Daoist readily imparted it.

Returning to the capital, Chen fabricated a tale: *"Master Ma has departed, but by good fortune, I obtained this divine archery—all thanks to Your Excellency’s blessings."* Delighted, Deng awaited nightfall. When the air grew thick with incense and the moon hung veiled, ghostly cries arose in the garden. He ordered Chen to demonstrate his newfound skill. Deng slipped behind the winding corridors to observe from a facing pavilion. Suddenly, a ghost flew into the building. Chen drew his mighty bow, loosed a flawless arrow—its fletching hissed through the air—and with a great cry, the target fell. Holding a candle, they saw it was Deng himself, struck in the left arm. Though spared his life, Chen fled at once.

Master Yuantong remarked, *"The crime of murder is grave enough, yet to seek the destruction of a man’s very soul—what cruelty could surpass this? Even had Chen truly learned Master Ma’s divine archery on Mount Taihang, who could say it would not turn against Deng Chang’en?"*

The Six Arts Charlatans

The grand secretary Wan An was inwardly cunning yet outwardly affable. At that time, Consort Wan’s favor was unrivaled, and the palace women addressed her kin as nephews and nieces. Her influence within and without grew ever more entrenched, so Wan An sought out alchemists and bedroom arts practitioners to present to her. The consort was overjoyed—yet before long, she died. Such was the consequence of Wan An’s pursuit of these arts.

The alchemist Lu Fengyuan, boasting of his mastery of the "art of plucking and battling," imparted his techniques to Wan An. Later, styling himself a Dharma Master, he ordered Wan An to receive the Dao on West Mountain. Lu arrived first and waited for him on the road for days, growing restless. Wandering the outskirts in boredom, he suddenly encountered a Daoist elder—pine-browed, crane-haired, with teeth tall and face ruddy, like the immortals Red Pine or Yellow Stone. When asked his surname, he did not answer; when questioned on the Dao, he remained silent.

The elder laughed and chanted:
*"Lu meets grievance, Lu meets grievance—
What fate brings you to Wan An today?"*
Then he vanished like drifting mist. Lu was stunned and hesitated to turn back.

By then, the sun had sunk behind the mountains, the forest darkened, and crows cawed in the gloom. Disoriented, he lost his way. Then he saw a woodcutter, a bundle of firewood on his back, who gave his surname as Zhang but would not disclose his given name. Lu begged for directions, and the old man pointed to a flickering lamp in the distance—there lay an inn. Bowing in thanks, Lu took his leave and sought lodging there.

Amid the creaking rafters, he heard sighs from the next room that night. Peering through a crack, he saw Wan An. His heart stirred with pity, and he longed to approach. He pried loose a rotting plank in the wall and slipped through, hoping to share a moment of intimacy.

Wan An, exhausted, had fallen asleep with his head propped on his hand. Hearing the wall creak, he suspected a bandit and seized a stool to strike—his assailant collapsed. His attendants rushed in with lanterns and found the man who had called himself Dharma Master Lu Fengyuan. When Wan An pressed him for an explanation, he learned it was merely a visit of concern. Lu prostrated himself in apology, and though in pain, Wan An returned the courtesy.

Lu asked, *"Why has Your Excellency not taken the main road, but come here instead?"*
Wan An replied, *"I followed my master’s command to journey to West Mountain. Last night, an immortal elder appeared in my dream and said:
*'Wan An, Wan An, seeking the Dao on West Mountain—
The great road there holds no fate for you.'*
So I took a side path by carriage, never expecting to meet you here—only to play this cruel jest."*

Master Yuantong remarked, *"To mistake a charlatan for a Dharma Master is foolishness indeed. A false master deserves a stool’s blow. Later, when Wan An still presented bedroom arts to the palace, Emperor Xianzong uncovered the scheme and dismissed him—leaving his disciple to miss his chance as well."*

At the close of the Chenghua era, the banished fangshi—Liang Fang, Li Zixing, Deng Changen, and Zhao Yuzhi—were successively pardoned. Yet the eunuch Jiang Cong insisted their crimes were beyond absolution, so while Liang and Li were left to die in disgrace, Deng and Zhao remained exiled to the frontier. During their initial banishment, travelers’ walls along the road bore verses in every place:

*"Li Zixing, Liang Fang—
their sins blazed bright.
Pardoned? No pardon is right.
Let them die in prison’s night.

Deng Changen, Zhao Yuzhi—
exiled to the western wilds.
Pardoned? No pardon smiles.
Forever parted from the Central Lands."*

The signature read: "Sealed by three sheets."

Master Yuantong remarked: *"These petty men, once disgraced, were already drained of life’s qi. Yet the hearts of small men are foolish—they still gazed back at the Three Terraces, hoping for restoration to power, much like Wan An when he was stripped of office. Thus my master inscribed these verses in jest, to settle the fate of their faction once and for all."*

**Poems on a Daoist Abbey’s Walls**
In the late Jiajing reign, an edict sought esoteric texts from across the realm. At Chongqing Abbey in the Nanjing Daoist precincts, four quatrains appeared on the walls, signed by the Reclusive Immortal Zhang Xuanxuan. A divine lamp would illuminate them by night, until one day, thunder and lightning snatched the characters away. The poems survive in the *Cloud and Water Collection*.

**Riot at Wei’s Shrine**
During the Tianqi era, shrines to Wei Zhongxian stood nearly everywhere under heaven, but none rivaled the splendor of the one outside Donghua Gate. One day, three ragged, mad Daoists strode in, stormed the shrine, and smashed Wei’s clay effigy, smearing its face with filth and mud. On the wall, they scrawled four lines:

*"A lewd shrine, decaying slow—
the royal house in ruins lies.
The brocade rivers and mountains
are left to ghosts to bestow."*

The character for "ghost" (*gui*) shared a radical with Wei’s name. The shrine’s guards, aghast, lunged to seize them—only for the three madmen to vanish. Fearing Wei’s wrath, the guards scrubbed the walls at once, yet the verses lingered with a faint fragrance, while the clay effigy reeked. That night, Wei’s entire body ached with pain.

Master Yuantong exclaimed: *"A joyous deed! A joyous deed! It should be added to the *History of Ming* to stir readers to roll up their sleeves and dance!"*

**Encounter with the Patriarch Lü**

In the early years of Shunzhi, as Qin and Shu remained unsettled, a Daoist roamed the land clad in furs, his comings and goings as elusive as mist. He would sigh as he walked, then suddenly laugh, then break into song:

*"Heaven and Earth—clear or not?
Leopards and tigers still prowl.
With a flick of my sleeve, I return to the Three Isles,
To gaze at Penglai’s limpid waters."*

Another Daoist approached, sword at his waist and whisk in hand, joining his voice to the song:

*"Before dawn’s fifth watch, the sky brightens,
Beyond the pass, clouds drift.
With you, I depart—
Heaven gains clarity through the One."*

Suddenly appearing, the sword-bearing Daoist addressed the fur-clad one: *"Master Sanfeng, now you may rest."* The other bowed in response, his words laced with Zen sharpness, beyond all unraveling. Then, in a burst of radiant light, crimson clouds swirled in the sky, weaving into the character *Lü*. The two Daoists ascended into the void and vanished. This account is recorded in *Ōu Yangzhen’s Miscellaneous Records of Chaos*. *"The withered plum blooms anew."*

During the Kangxi reign, along the road to Linyou at Ma Family Inn, stood a withered plum tree, its trunk gnarled and ancient, its planting year unknown. On a bitter winter’s day of snow and cold, a Daoist named Zhang, clad in tattered robes, arrived at dawn. He called for the innkeeper to prepare noodles, but before the dough had thickened, it was served to him. The Daoist said, *"I do not eat raw dough—give it to the withered plum instead, that it may rejoice."* He tossed the noodles onto the tree’s branches and, laying down his coins, departed. The innkeeper found this strange. The next morning, he looked and saw the withered plum had burst into bloom, its branches forming the character *feng* in abundance. The inn prospered greatly thereafter, and though the innkeeper often watered the tree with noodle broth, it withered once more.

Yuantongzi remarked: *"Lüzu revived the camphor, Qiuzu revived the cypress, and Zhangzu revived the plum—all may be said to have extended their virtue to the grasses and trees."*

---

*Green Clouds Ward Off Heat*

The Patriarch traveled through the Shu Mountains, where yellow brambles grew in abundance. At the height of summer’s heat, the village elders toiled in the fields, overcome by the scorching sun. The Master wove a circle from yellow bramble branches and placed it upon his head. Suddenly, green clouds like a parasol floated above him, drifting wherever he went. Many who witnessed this imitated him, finding great coolness and no heat-induced illness. The village elders composed a verse: *"Though yellow brambles crown the head, green clouds soon shade the brow; though the fields lie open to the sky, the blazing sun need not burn now."*

To this day, it remains a tale of the fields and gardens.

Yuantongzi said: *"Whether fashioned into a hat or brewed as tea, this plant is most excellent."*

---

*West Stream’s Feigned Slumber*

In Tongzhou there lived an old farmer, a man of considerable wealth who in life had been much inclined toward goodness. When he passed away, a Daoist came to offer condolences, introducing himself as the "Tianwai Sanren" (the "Untrammeled Man Beyond the Heavens"), a name he had taken from the Tang poem line *"beyond the heavens, three peaks."* He instructed the farmer’s son to bury his father in the Qinling Mountains, at a site where two earthen mounds like breasts stood with a pair of stones cradling between them. He further advised: *"When I select a burial ground for others, I require only that it be free of wind, water, mud, sand, and ants—nothing more. Never heed blind masters who urge you to relocate or alter the site."*

For ten years after the burial, all remained peaceful. Then, swayed by a certain geomancer’s persuasive talk of sealing and consecrating the grave, the son’s heart wavered, and he resolved to rebury his father. Hearing that the Daoist still resided at the West Stream Pavilion’s fields, he went to seek his approval. Upon arriving at the pavilion, he found the Daoist sound asleep upon a rock. The son pushed him repeatedly, but the Daoist, half-awake, murmured: *"Your father lies at rest—why disturb him?"* The son, failing to grasp the meaning, pushed harder, yet the Daoist only snored louder, refusing to answer.

The son returned home and, following the geomancer’s advice, had the grave opened. There, the old farmer’s bones gleamed like gold, and remorse struck him deeply. Though the geomancer insisted on his own reasoning, the remains were moved to another location. Within a decade, the family’s fortunes withered. When the son sought the Daoist again, he was told the man had departed the previous year for parts unknown. Later, he encountered the same geomancer—now blind and begging in the marketplace.

Yuantongzi said: *"The son of the old farmer was truly most unfilial."*

**Golden Foil and Radiant Dots**

In the early Hongwu reign, the Immortal Zhang Jinbo of Pingyang—so named for his family’s craft of gold-leaf paper—concealed profound Daoist arts while wandering among men. He often used gold foil as medicine to treat illnesses, and none failed to show miraculous results.

Then there appeared another man, Zhang Jindian, who wore a pale blue robe entirely adorned with golden dots, hence his name. Those who saw him were dazzled. Jindian declared: *"Let one who suffers illness take but a single dot of mine, and their malady will surely be cured."* When people sought to test him, the effects were as divine as promised, and he asked for no payment. At the time, epidemics raged through the southern provinces, and Jindian was mobbed daily by crowds clamoring for his dots, until his robe was stripped bare. Yet the next day, when he appeared in the marketplace, the dots were restored as before, and all bowed to him as a divine master. A month later, as the epidemics waned, Jindian said: *"My work here is done; I shall return to the cloud-wrapped mountains."* With that, he cast his golden-dotted robe to the ground. As people scrambled to seize it, Zhang transformed into a beam of golden light and soared into the sky.

Later, Liu Bowen heard of this and remarked: *"This must have been Zhang Sanfeng, who disguised himself as Jindian to complement Zhang Jinbo’s radiance."*

**Prescriptions from a Dream**

During the Ming dynasty, there lived a man named Zhu, a native of Yanzhou. Kind and filial, he suddenly developed an eye ailment that left him unable to see even those before him. Day and night, he prayed to Heaven, until one night he dreamed of a golden-hued divine figure with a beard like a halberd, his Daoist bearing ethereal. The figure beckoned Zhu forward and said: *"Your heart is sincere and reverent. I shall bestow upon you a wondrous prescription—one application, and your sight will be restored. Take one *liang* of fine saltpeter, melt it in a copper vessel, then add two *fen* of refined lead oxide and two *fen* of borneol. Stir swiftly with a copper spoon and store in a jar. Apply a small amount each time—the efficacy is beyond description."*

When Zhu awoke, he marveled at the dream and prepared the remedy as instructed. By the next day, his vision was restored. Overwhelmed with gratitude, he burned incense toward the heavens and prostrated himself in reverence. Later, while passing through Yuncheng, he stopped at Zhangxian Temple. Upon entering, he suddenly recognized the deity’s likeness as identical to the figure from his dream. Startled, he vowed to disseminate the prescription for the benefit of all. To this day, the formula remains recorded in the *Compendium of Materia Medica*.

**The Transcendence of Wang Mengjiu**

Wang Xiling, styled Mengjiu, was a native of She County in Huizhou. A Ming Jiajing-era *jinshi*, he was a descendant of the loyal and martyred Vice Censor-in-Chief. Though his family had long been prosperous, he upheld propriety and righteousness. After serving as an official in Jiangdu, Yangzhou, he settled there as a sojourner.

From birth, Wang possessed an extraordinary nature. As a child, he displayed precocious wisdom; in adulthood, he demonstrated administrative talent. He married a woman of the Liu clan, whose temperament was exceedingly serene. Once, she dreamed of the female immortal He Yiyang, who had a fondness for profound learning. For over twenty years, she and Wang recited verses together, until one day she passed away in meditation.

**The Transcendence of Wang Mengjiu (continued)**

Wang never remarried. Throughout his life, he rose from the position of *Biejia* official to become the Surveillance Commissioner of Jiannan in Sichuan, where he trained troops and cherished the people, earning their deep respect. After two years in office, Jiannan suffered from incessant rain. Wang cut his fingernails, walked barefoot to Meishan, and burned incense in prayer for seven days until the skies cleared—a response, it was said, to his benevolence. On his return journey via Shaluo Plain, he suddenly encountered the perfected master Zhang Sanfeng, who was traveling to Mount Emei. Though they had never met, their bond was as if of old. The master perceived his nature and said: *"Now the sagely Son of Heaven reigns above, aided by worthy ministers and noble officials. Do not forget the time we once shared in Penglai."* Wang then awakened fully: he had originally been a spiritual emanation of Shen Wansan, sent into the world, and now recognized Sanfeng as his true teacher. He sought further guidance, and the master imparted to him the essentials of the Golden Elixir.

In his leisure, Wang would sit in meditation between the towering peaks of Gaobiao and Lingyun. There, he built a hermitage and alchemical chamber, and on Jiuri Peak, he prepared his own coffin, naming it the *Hidden Release Abode*. By night, he communed with his immortal teacher. Under his governance, the land flourished, and the yamen gates grew over with grass—so little was there for him to attend to. Yet he could not yet depart, for his aged parents still lived. Later, when promoted to Yongbei in Yunnan, he requested leave to care for them, fearing entanglement in the mundane world. The appointment, however, fell on a *ding* year, which violated the established regulations, and his request was denied.

He was then appointed Vice Commissioner of River Conservancy for Henan Province. On his way to assume office, he passed through Yangzhou and crossed the Yangtze, where he again met Master Sanfeng, who transmitted to him a secret formula. Shortly after, he fell gravely ill and returned home. By then, his first wife, Madame Liu, had passed away years earlier. He instructed his son, Simin, to escort her coffin to Sichuan and inter it on Jiuri Peak. His own illness worsened, and for over a month, he abstained from grain, yet his complexion grew ever more radiant. One day, he said to his younger brother: *"Serve our father well. I am about to depart."* He bathed, dressed in formal attire, and as faint clouds descended from the sky, a single breath rose from his crown and he passed away.

This occurred on the seventh day of the second month in the *jiachen* year of the Yongzheng reign, at the *chou* hour. When his body was placed in the coffin, it was as light as a cicada’s molted husk—proof that he had attained the Dao and become a perfected being. His son, following his father’s last wishes, accompanied both coffins to Sichuan and buried them together on Jiuri Peak. Later, a woodcutter from Banan saw Wang on Mount Emei, accompanied by a towering Daoist master, traversing sheer cliffs in flight. His appearance remained as it had been in life, his beard and whiskers flowing in the wind.

**Postscript:**
This account is titled *The Transcendence of Wang Mengjiu*, yet it reads like a brief biography of Master Mengjiu. The reason is this: as Surveillance Commissioner of Jiannan, his virtuous governance and benevolent policies are still praised today. Moreover, his roots in the Dao and his vessel for immortality, combined with his fulfillment of both loyalty and filial piety, moved his ancestral master to descend and guide him. Here, I have gathered scattered records, selected forgotten anecdotes, and consulted inscriptions from his burial site to illuminate his life. In doing so, I also honor the diligence of his master in guiding the world, while chronicling Mengjiu’s own journey.

**Appendix: Master Mengjiu’s Self-Composed Record of the Hidden Release Abode**
The Daoist’s name is Xiling, styled Mengjiu, with the sobriquet Yuantong. A native of Shuijie Mountain in She County, Huizhou Prefecture, he sojourned in Jiangdu County, Yangzhou Prefecture. He served as *Biejia*, prefect, and in the Ministries of Revenue and Works, and as Surveillance Commissioner of Jiannan in Sichuan. He received the secret methods of self-cultivation from the school of Master Zhang Sanfeng.

Having admired the clear seclusion of Lingyun’s mountains and waters, he personally arranged his burial site, declaring upon its completion: *"Within these peaks lies a cavern shaped like the celestial seat of immortals. Aligned with the mountain’s *hai* direction, it shall serve as the future resting place for my bones."* He left behind a seven-character regulated verse, recorded here:

*"A propitious site to inter immortal bones,
Waters encircle, hills embrace—doubly kind.
Beneath the sun, pure springs bestow their virtue’s grace,
Crimson clouds and quiet chambers guard the sacred mound.
The Daoist long shed worldly burdens,
The filial son need not grieve the wind through trees.
Say not this old man was ever truly dead—
Why not display the tally plain for all to see?"*

On the third day of the fourth lunar month in the *guimao* year of Yongzheng’s reign (1723), Daoist Yuantong prepared his coffin and inscribed this record.

**Obscure Traces of Qin’an**
In Qin’an County, there was a man called Zhang Pengtou, who claimed to be from Zhongzhou yet also called himself *"a man from beyond the heavens."* His hair was coiled in a single topknot, and he wore the same tattered robe winter and summer, wandering the markets in a manner resembling madness. When well-meaning folk offered him food or drink, he would consume it all without regard for quality or quantity.

At first, no one ever saw him drunk or sated. Sometimes he would go without food or drink for days on end, yet showed no sign of hunger or thirst. At night, he would sleep on the open ground of temples or monasteries, often lying motionless for ten days at a time. The crowd, thinking him dead, would prod him with their feet, whereupon he would stretch, yawn, and open his eyes, saying, *"My sleep was not yet complete—why do you disturb me?"*

A local scholar named Cai had a villa west of the city at Stone Buddha Temple, where flowers and trees flourished in bright elegance, and winding railings enclosed the courtyard. He invited Zhang Pengtou to stay, and Pengtou accepted without hesitation. Cai, who delighted in social gatherings, used the villa as a retreat, daily hosting musicians to play bamboo flutes and pluck strings, while Pengtou remained utterly indifferent. Cai remarked, *"When evening falls, he lies stiff as a corpse, motionless through the night without so much as a breath."*

Once, Cai asked about his methods, and Pengtou replied, *"The foundational verses of the sacred texts are the gateways of the Three Teachings—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. The path begins with stillness, and only after mastering it do the ways diverge. The Confucian school grounds itself in all things, the Buddha empties itself of all things, and the Supreme One transcends all things. You are a man of learning—you should grasp this yourself."*

Cai’s wife was fiercely jealous, berating and cursing her in-laws. Cai feared her like a tiger. Learning that he and his friends were amusing themselves at the villa, she flew into a rage and stormed over to drive them out. Cai, trembling, told Pengtou, *"Do not worry. When she comes, I will handle it."* When she arrived, she found Pengtou sitting in the doorway. Her voice thundered with fury as she railed at him, then lunged forward and struck his cheeks with both hands. Pengtou sat unmoved, serene. She, however, felt her hands swell with unbearable pain, as if they were being crushed. She rushed home, her fingers swollen like hanging mallets, festering with boils. She wailed through the night and died by dawn.

By the forty-ninth year of Qianlong’s reign (1784), in the fourth lunar month, Pengtou suddenly urged Cai to return home. Cai, lost in revelry, resisted at first but eventually relented. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the rebel Ma Xinming, leading his band from Fuqiang, fled back to Stone Peak Fortress, laying waste to everything along the way as they passed Stone Buddha Temple—yet Cai’s villa was spared.

Later, a man called Chen Yexian also came to wander in Qin’an. A native of Pingliang, he dressed in Daoist robes but drank wine, ate meat, and lived like an ordinary man. He built a hut on the sheer cliffs of Dragon Gate Mountain, where even birds could scarcely land, yet he ascended and descended with ease. Though his traces were not far from people, if one sought him at the foot of the peak and called *"Master Chen!"*, he would appear. When asked about fortunes or misfortunes, he would only say, *"Let it be! Let it be!"* He once helped villagers move boulders up a cliff, and another time, he spat water to extinguish a fire. His wondrous deeds were too many to recount.

Hearing of Yexian’s arrival, Cai invited him to his home to meet Pengtou. Yexian seemed deeply abashed in Pengtou’s presence. After three days, he took his leave. Cai asked Pengtou what he thought of Yexian, and Pengtou replied, *"There are two paths to immortality. The superior path begins with stillness—first, one must banish stray thoughts, then master embryonic breathing, and finally, practice the arts of subduing dragons and tigers. These are all simple matters; the true challenge lies in refining the Golden Elixir. Once the Elixir is complete, one may ascend at will, coming and going freely. Yexian, however, follows the talismanic school—stillness brings clouds and mist, action brings thunder and lightning. Yet if he receives proper transmission of the secret essence from an authentic master, he too may join the immortals of the Southern Palace. Otherwise, in five hundred years, he will not escape the thunder tribulation. Fortunately, Yexian’s heart is kind, and he often uses his arts to relieve suffering. Though he walks a different path, I shall pass on the Great Dao to him."*

Before long, Pengtou also departed, vanishing like a wisp. Yexian was stout and dark-complexioned, with impeccable manners. Pengtou, with his gaunt, ancient face and luminous spirit, came and went in an instant, like a soaring dragon.

Master Empty Boat said: *"Hai Ting spoke of Zhang the Perfected One, who often wandered through towns, feigning madness with disheveled hair, calling himself 'Pengtou the Spirit.' The Perfected One dwells in the world without displaying wonders, yet if he did not reveal himself as an immortal, he might be mistaken for someone like Yexian. Thus, he swept aside the side doors to uphold the true Way, and by slaying the shrewish wife to save Cai’s family, he subtly revealed the marvel of uniting Dao with method. Alas, Cai remained blind to it."*

**Postscript to *Hidden Mirror***

During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor of the Pure Dynasty, Grand Secretary Zhang Tingyu, Duke Wenhe, was commissioned by imperial edict to compile the *History of the Ming*. In the preface to the *Biographies of Immortals*, he wrote: *"At the dawn of the Ming, figures such as Zhou Dian and Zhang Sanfeng left traces so arcane and elusive that none could fathom them, yet they shook the Son of Heaven to his core—surely they were no charlatans currying favor. How true these words are!"*

**Biography of Chen Leigu**

The immortal Chen Leigu, styled Kefu, was a native of Dinghai. From birth, he was untrammeled and spirited, his bearing uncommon. From youth, he cherished the arts of immortality, harboring no ambition for official rank. He encountered Lin Quan, a Daoist of Pingjiang, who transmitted to him the method of summoning thunder.

At a time of severe drought, prayers went unanswered. Someone jesting said: *"The Daoist Chen can call forth thunder and rain."* He was summoned to the official court, where they awaited his failure to humiliate him. Kefu immediately invoked his method, and in an instant, clouds gathered, thunder and lightning crashed, and rain fell over a foot deep.

He often visited Tianqing Abbey in Yin. One Mid-Autumn, as a group of alchemists gathered to admire the moon, Kefu declined to join them. In jest, they sprayed ink-water into the air, and suddenly dark clouds blotted out the moon, raining black rain. The guests fled in alarm, their robes dyed black. Realizing it was his doing, they invited him to their table. The clouds dispersed, the mist cleared, and the moon shone bright once more. His responsiveness was ever of this kind.

During the Zhiyuan era, the Yuan Shizu summoned him to court and appointed him abbot of Changchun Palace. In his leisure, he would shut his door and sit in quietude, refusing to receive guests.

**Biography of Chen Zhongxing**
Chen Gong of Wenzhou, named Yu, styled Zhongxing, served as *shanzhang* of Mingdao Academy in Yuanjiang and *jiaoshou* of the Eastern Prefecture. A native of Jinling, he was gentle in demeanor yet resolute within, deeply versed in the great principles. When the Ming Taizu crossed the Yangtze, the censor Qin Yuan recommended him. The emperor summoned him with a letter, and upon their conversation, was greatly pleased. He was entrusted with military affairs and consulted on matters of secrecy, offered the post of *gongfeng*, which he declined. Later, he was successively appointed Academician, Left Assistant Director of the Secretariat, Grand Academician of Hongwen, Minister of Rites, and Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices—all of which he refused. Even gifts of gold and silk were declined. The Gao Emperor visited his residence thrice, inviting him into the inner palace to be seated. When ill, he was sent imperial physicians and medicines. At seventy-two, he passed without illness. The emperor mourned deeply, thrice expressing his grief, and bestowed a coffin and silks. Among the officials and nobles of the time, none were thought to have received such favor. When the lord first met Taizu, he urged only restraint in killing, as the hope of the people. Asked about the governance of the Yuan, he could only weep. During his audiences, he would burn incense and sit solemnly, like an old mountain monk. Taizu repeatedly sent men to observe him, and he would simply recite from the *Vajracchedikā-sūtra*: *"Thus should one subdue the mind, thus should one subdue the mind."* Thus, he was never suspected from beginning to end. Yet his refusal of office may also be called loyalty to the Yuan. As *The History of the Yuan* does not record him, I have here set forth his memory.

**Biography of Wanpuzi**
Wanpuzi, surnamed Cheng, named Yao, styled Guangbiao, was a native of Xin’an. The son of the reclusive scholar Tuanxiao, he was of imposing stature and bold temperament.

His mother, née Ni, dreamed of a divine being presenting her with a red jade before giving birth to him. As a child, he possessed extraordinary intelligence, reciting classics and histories as if already well-versed. When Lady Ni passed away, he mourned with the grief of a grown man. From then on, he studied diligently each day, mastering what was transmitted from the hearts of Confucius and Mencius, as well as the essential teachings of the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*. In adulthood, he married Lady Zhou, whose given name was Xi and courtesy name Yuanji. She was deeply learned, able to discern discrepancies in the *Comprehensive Mirror* and historical records, earning the title of "Scholar of the Boudoir." Though born in the same year, he came into the world on the Winter Solstice, while Yuanji was born on the Summer Solstice—one embodying minor yang, the other minor yin.

He served his father-in-law, Jingfu, with filial devotion; in leisure, he listened to Guangbiao’s recitations and often engaged in discussions of principle. After Tuanxiao’s death, he observed mourning rites with strict adherence to propriety. Upon completing the mourning period, he journeyed north. Song Lian, upon meeting him, marveled, saying, *"Beyond the dust of the world, Tuanxiao lives on."* Soon after, he departed to study swordsmanship under Wu Zhen, mastering its techniques within a single month. He then girded his sword and set out to wander. Encountering Wang Zhongdu in Juqu, he received instruction in the Great Dao and was told to choose a place for cultivation. Returning to Mount Bei, he secluded himself for twelve years, achieving Daoist mastery at the age of thirty-six. Only then did he return home to see Yuanji and instruct their son in reading.

Thereupon, he slept alone in the central hall. Yuanji secretly observed him and saw him seated cross-legged upon the bed, a golden radiance emanating from his crown, illuminating the entire chamber. The next morning, she entreated, *"Why do you not transmit the Dao to me?"* Guangbiao replied, *"I intend to deliver all under heaven—how could I withhold it from you? Yet I have not yet repaid my master’s grace, and thus dare not do so."* He then journeyed to Mount Dahe, where he paid homage to Perfected Wang, who bestowed upon him the title *Wanpuzi*. After offering his thanks, he departed, carrying his sword to roam Jinyang. Turning toward Jing and Chu, he encountered Yao Guangxiao, who had left the household life at Miaozhi Hermitage under the Dharma name Daoyan. Though ordained in the Buddhist teachings, he delighted in discussing military strategy. Once, while traveling in Xinye of Nanyang, he visited the relics of the Reclining Dragon and composed a poem at the temple, taking great pleasure in it. Suddenly, a man seated beside him shouted, *"What monk are you, daring to mock the Martial Marquis?"* Startled, Daoyan saw a Daoist in robes, girded with a sword, his countenance refined and extraordinary. He bowed and said, *"An unintended sigh in verse—why does the Daoist master reproach me so severely? Pray, whence do you come?"* The Daoist replied, *"I am called Wanpu. I wander as I please, for the verdant forests and azure peaks are all my dwelling."* Then, laughing heartily to the heavens, he departed. Later, when Daoyan became the trusted advisor of the Prince of Yan and aided his usurpation of the throne, Wanpu thus shamed him for it.

In the early years of the Jianwen reign, when the Prince of Yan attended the imperial funeral and returned as far as Huaiyin, his second son, Gao Xu, led troops to meet him. Suddenly, a great storm arose, with sand and stones whirling in chaos, leaving no path of escape. Then a fierce shout rang out: *"For now, I spare you!"* At once, the sky cleared. A Daoist was seen, hand resting on his sword, smiling faintly.

The prince sought to question him further, but with a gust of wind, the Daoist vanished. Upon returning, he ordered Daoyan to divine the matter. Daoyan said, *"This is but the playful trick of an immortal."*

For after shaming Daoyan, Wanpu had already learned of the Prince of Yan’s journey to court and thus appeared midway, displaying his arts of concealment and warning him. In the fourth month of summer, during the minor memorial rites for the late Emperor Taizu, the Prince of Yan dispatched his heir and others to attend. The Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu, secretly memorialized the throne to detain them. The prince entered Huizu’s stables, stole a fine steed, and fled first.

At that time, Wanpu was visiting me on Mount Wudang. From afar, he saw the prince approaching, drew his sword, and pointed it at him. The horse reared in terror, whinnying and bolting uncontrollably, unable to be reined in until it reached the riverbank—where it seemed to plummet from the clouds and mist.

Later, when the Prince of Yan besieged Jinan, Magistrate Tie Xuan ordered his troops and people to feign surrender, defeating the prince beneath the city walls. Daoyan was also among the army, inspecting the camp when a man approached him and said, *"I possess the strategy to breach the city."* He handed over a sealed letter and departed at once. Daoyan opened it to find these words:

*"Advising on military affairs,
Yet failing to recognize feigned surrender’s ploy—
Your army’s fortunes at Jinan will wane.
How does this compare to Liu Chengyi?
Not at all."*

Daoyan read it, shame and fear mingling within him. Recalling the man’s features, he realized it was the very one he had encountered before the shrine of Zhuge Liang.

Wan Puba once more journeyed to the Huai region, where he encountered the Yan army advancing to attack Cangzhou, with Gao Xu guarding the rear. Suddenly, a violent hailstorm erupted, striking the northern forces and scattering them in retreat, leaving Gao Xu severely wounded as he fled. By chance, Master Zhou Yin of Yaozhen met him and, astonished, asked, *"The Prince of Yan is a ruler ordained by the Mandate of Heaven—why have you thwarted him?"* Puba replied, *"Sir, you are mistaken! The Prince of Yan, Zhu Di, is today’s Guan and Cai. Had there been no Duke of Zhou, he would have carried out his ambitions. Yet you ascribe the Mandate of Heaven to him—if this were so, then every powerful vassal who rebels against the state could claim the Mandate, and the moral order would collapse entirely. I have pondered this deeply and cannot yield to vulgar opinion. Thus, I twice shamed Daoguang and thrice humiliated Gao Xu, all to uphold the great ethical principles, preserve the teachings of propriety, and ensure that posterity knows the Yan prince’s army was intolerable even to recluses of the mountains and forests—proving he was no ruler ordained by Heaven. Since ancient times, when true men arise, they must eliminate the cruel and expel the violent. The highest, like Tang and Wu, or the next, like Gaozu and Guangwu, may then be called ordained by Heaven. In recent times, the Taizu Emperor founded the dynasty, pacified the rebels, and succeeded the Great Yuan—he too may be deemed ordained. Yet Heaven bestowed the realm upon the Ming, and we must honor as the Mandate of Heaven that which our ancestors transmitted. Had the Prince of Yan not usurped the throne, how could we know that Jianwen’s descendants would have lacked an heir? Moreover, since his enthronement, he has governed with filial piety and benevolence—Heaven originally had no intention of altering the succession. The Prince of Yan’s coercion of the weak was no different from a village bully seizing his clansman’s property—what has this to do with the Mandate of Heaven? Now Gao Xu is violent toward all things, aiding his father in rebellion, while Daoyan, that treacherous slave, abets his ambitions. Even those of shallow understanding are indignant—how much more so the heroic! I have heard, sir, that you are a worthy descendant of the Jiao-Li Duke. Yet recalling the Four Elders of Mount Shang’s assistance, why did they favor the younger son over the eldest? Even Lady Qi’s son once occupied the throne as Emperor Hui—would you, sir, acknowledge him?"* Zhou Yin of Yaozhen was left speechless and soon took his leave.

Puba returned to his mountain dwelling, where Yuan Ji paid him a visit, saying, *"The matter of marriage has been settled on your behalf. Shall I now transmit to you the Way?"* Thereupon, she taught him the secret of returning to the origin and restoring the primordial, and he cultivated it day and night. His son, too, nurtured the fetal embryo through inner alchemy, and after nine years, a grandson was conceived in the womb, capable of dividing his form to respond to phenomena and journeying in spirit a thousand *li*. Meanwhile, Yuan Ji’s countenance grew ever more youthful, as she awakened to past causes, and together with Puba’s son, they ascended the Jasper Isle.

**Eulogy:**
Cheng Wanpu was a loyal and righteous immortal. His shaming of Guangxiao, his thwarting of Gao Xu, and his remonstrance with Yin of Yao—bold indeed! Yet was his dragon-like nature not still untamed? Later, hearing of the nurturing of the grandson and his entry into the *Fu* Tower of Baoshan to compile the *History of Immortals* alongside Master Xu, he became most refined and scholarly.

**Biography of Huizhongzi**

Huizhongzi, surnamed Xu, named Renrui, and styled Jiwu, was the son of Xu Jingfu, the Marquis of Dianchi. His mother, née Hong, first bore a daughter named Dagu, then Huizhong, on the eighth day of the fourth month in the first year of the Hongwu reign. In his infancy, he died and revived, suddenly awakening to divine wisdom. Earlier, the Marquis of Dianchi had been bold and ambitious, spurring himself to military service and being transferred to distant posts, never able to return—Huizhong was still young at the time. He once studied under Professor Han, mastering the classics and histories, earning the local reputation of a child prodigy. Yet Huizhong’s nature was serene and detached, ever drawn to the cultivation of the mysterious. Each day, returning from the academy, he encountered a red-bearded Daoist who beckoned him forward and said, *"Young one, if you have the heart to learn the Dao, do you know that the Way is not far from man? Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness are its foundation."* He then transmitted a wondrous method, vanishing into the deep forest. Huizhong returned home and resolved to repay his origins, vowing loyalty and sincerity. Reflecting on his aged father’s long absence in the army, with no news for years, he wished to search for him everywhere. Yet his mother was alone and frail, with no one to attend her, so he dared not depart hastily. His elder sister had married Zhu Yunzhang of Loujiang, who devoted himself to knight-errantry, vowing to serve the court and seek official rank. Huizhong sighed upon hearing this, thinking, *"Brother Zhu harbors such ambitions!"* He kept his concern to himself, never speaking of it to his mother.

He married Tao Shi, whose childhood name was Zhonggu and later changed to Fu, styled Yugen. She was quick-witted and perceptive, able to read ancient classics. Though a year younger than Huizhong, they shared the same month, day, and hour of birth. She served her mother-in-law with devotion, earning the praise of being a "dual paragon of filial piety." With such a virtuous and compliant wife, Huizhong gathered disciples to teach, using his stipends to support his parents. Later, as his family grew, making a living became difficult, so he studied the arts of medicine, specializing in the treatment of smallpox and epidemic diseases. The people of the land whose lives he saved were beyond count.

Hearing that Zhu Yunzhang had died in battle while aiding the king, he prepared a boat to console his elder sister. Reflecting on his father’s military service, with no news of his fate, his resolve to seek him grew even stronger. He vowed to traverse the ends of heaven and earth to find him. At thirty, with a long beard of five strands, a river-like mouth, sword-like brows, a fine nose, and bright eyes, he favored sky-blue robes and pale yellow skirts, his bearing ethereal, like that of an immortal. Accompanied by two young attendants, he boarded a boat. In Jiangxi, children afflicted with illness sought his healing, and he distributed all gifts and surplus provisions to the poor. Wandering through Chu and Shu, he reached the Qutang Gorge and the Three Gorges. Learning that the Marquis of Xu was in southern Yunnan, he set out to find him. Upon arriving in Shufu and inquiring, he discovered that his father had once garrisoned Dali but had passed away two years prior.

Grieving to the point of near-collapse, he set out that very day, weeping as he rushed to Dali. After searching, he found the grave just outside the northern gate in Heping Ward. Stepping into the courtyard, his heart heavy with sorrow, he suddenly saw two youths rush out and stare in astonishment. Both sides were shocked and doubtful, for the Marquis of Xu, having heard that Hong’s son had died, had taken two concubines, the Ladies Yan and Tang, to continue the ancestral line, and these two sons were theirs. After exchanging glances and questions, they realized they were half-brothers by different mothers, and so he asked the two ladies to come forth and pay their respects. He then had his brothers lead him to the grave, where he built a hut and stayed for seven days, mourning with such grief that he wasted away in proper observance of ritual.

At this time, thoughts of returning home arose, and he wished to take the two ladies and his brothers back east with him. But as their marital ties were here, they were unwilling to relocate, so he bid them farewell and set out on his journey home. Upon first arriving at his residence, he entered the central hall to pay respects to his mother, only to see a mourning canopy. Lifting it, he found a coffin before him, and cried out in shock, “What is this?” The household gathered, weeping as they bowed. Lady Zhong said, “Ever since you left, the old lady was consumed by longing, and suddenly collapsed.” Hearing this, Huìtōng was overwhelmed with grief. He performed the rites of sacrifice and burial, then deepened his mourning at the grave.

One day, the red-bearded man from before arrived and said, “I am a hidden immortal of the Western Mountains. I have heard that your filial virtue has moved Heaven, and you are destined for eternal life and transcendence.” He then summoned Huìtōng and Lady Zhong before him and transmitted the secret of the Great Elixir. Huìtōng and Lady Zhong bowed and took the immortal as their master. After the immortal departed, they each swept the alchemical chamber clean and diligently cultivated their practice. In less than a year, the Golden Elixir was complete.

On another day, while traveling in the Western Mountains, he again met the immortal master, who transmitted the Divine Elixir. They then set up a furnace in the Grotto-Heaven of the Forest Chamber to refine it further. White clouds filled the sky, and crimson radiance covered the earth. From that moment on, the entire household ascended together.

When Huìtōng first entered the Western Mountains, he saw a stone gate in the depths of a perilous cliff. Bending low, he entered and crawled for a long time until faint light appeared. Striking a jade chime once, all things became luminous, and within the cavern, another world unfolded—a scene of transcendence. There, forests and springs stretched boundlessly, clouds and waters soared, and apes and cranes called to one another beyond the mist. Yet pavilions and towers were no different from those of the human realm. As he wandered through the courtyards, he saw halls named “Hall of Halls,” pavilions called “Pavilion of Pavilions,” verandas titled “Veranda of Verandas,” and towers inscribed “Tower of Towers.” Huìtōng nearly lost all sense of where he was.

Suddenly, two officials approached to welcome him, saying, “By the command of the Mysterious Sage, we have been awaiting one of immortal talent.” They led Huìtōng to a stone tower, its plaque reading “Jeweled Tower of the Flower Treasury.” The two officials left him inside and locked the door behind them. Huìtōng sat in quiet contemplation. An attendant served a meal, with a zither and books on the table and fragrant tea before him. Upon examining the tower’s walls, he found an edict from the Most High, ordering him to carefully examine the jade scrolls and compile the *History of Immortals*. Upon completion, he would be permitted to reunite with his entire family.

Thereupon, he took up the immortal brush, smoothed the cloud-silk, and diligently researched each day with meticulous care. All the immortal traces of past and present, the transmission of the Great Dao, were arranged and recorded in brilliant clarity, shining like stars and sun. Time passed uncounted—days and nights blurred together. Then, an elder appeared, unlocking the gate and entering. Huìtōng bowed to him, and the elder said, “I am Língwēizǐ, master of this grotto. Your achievement of such rare merit brings fortune to both immortals and mortals.” Huìtōng expressed his gratitude and requested leave to wander freely. The elder replied, “You may now go forth and observe. Your family has already been moved to the front residence. Please go and see them.”

With the joy of reunion between infant and maiden, Huìtōng descended the Jeweled Tower. A blue-clad youth led the way, first through the Gate of Wù and Jǐ, then to the Eastern Hall, where he glimpsed Lady Zhong in official attire. She curtsied and said, “You may now go and see your parents.” Entering the inner courtyard, he saw his mother seated beside a majestic, bearded elder on a carefree couch—his father, now a perfected immortal. Huìtōng wept as he bowed before his mother and asked how she had come to be there. She said, “After my passing, the red-bearded Daoist sent a vajra guardian to protect me day and night, saying they awaited your Daoist attainment so we could ascend together. The one seated beside me is your father.” In that moment, parents, wife, and children were all reunited in the Grotto-Heaven of the Forest Chamber.

Alas! Huìtōng’s immortal rank brought such honor to his entire family. Possessing the art of healing others, he had journeyed ten thousand *li* to seek his kin—truly a paragon of benevolence and filial piety. Yet when he departed, his father had already passed, and he could not see him; when he returned, his mother had died, and he could not send her off. No sorrow of a child surpasses this. But upon compiling the *History* in the Jeweled Tower and transcending with his whole family, he understood that Heaven’s reward for benevolence and filial piety is never amiss.

Later, he was enfeoffed as Grand Scribe of the Celestial Convergence and Universal Relief Envoy, while Lady Zhong was named Lady Yìyǐn of Pure Chastity. This account wondrously harmonizes with the alchemical classics and immortal brush.

**Eulogy:**
Xu Huìtōng was a benevolent, filial immortal. He sheltered and supported his mother, used medicine to seek his father—his learning and many talents shaping his character. Yet it is lamentable that in his distant search for his late father, he could not be present for his living mother, leaving this lingering regret. For a child in such a plight, only by leaving the household to seek the Dao could he hope for his family’s shared ascension. Had he not possessed immortal talent to complete the *History of Immortals*, how nearly impossible it would have been!

**A Short Biography of Shěn Xiànyáng**
Shěn Xiànyáng was the eldest daughter of Wànshān.

Her voice was resonant, her frame robust—she bore no semblance of a woman’s form. At three years of age, she vanished, and none knew where she had gone.

When Wànshān journeyed to Yunnan with his disciples, I went to meet him in Diān, where together we refined the Great Elixir of Heavenly Origin. Only after a full year did it reach completion. Later, Xiànyáng came to see me—more than thirty years had passed since our parting. Father and daughter met again, yet neither recognized the other. Only after careful inquiry did we realize she was his eldest daughter.

Separated from her kin in infancy, it nearly became an eternal farewell, though in her tender youth she remained unaware. At the moment of her departure from the inner chambers, she encountered Xuē Zhēnyáng, the one anciently called the Mysterious Maiden of Zhōngtiáo. She was given the name Yùxiá and the style Xiànyáng, entrusted with the divine sword and charged with guarding the myriad secret methods of the Jade Casket. Thus she received the transmission of the Great Dao of Spiritual Penetration.

While Wànshān and I were refining the Elixir of Heavenly Origin, she came to Yunnan at Zhēnyáng’s instruction to partake of the completed medicine together. Overjoyed, Wànshān produced the finished elixir, and the entire family consumed it, ascending in transcendence.

Xiànyáng’s boundless compassion moved her to a vow of universal salvation for all beings. She often declared, *"Those who endure aid the Dao; those who delight in killing必 lose their primordial essence."* Thereafter, she wandered the four directions with her father, transforming and liberating wherever she went.

Alas!

The lady may well be called a hero among female transcendents.

The Yu family father and daughter spread their teachings across the southeast, where many possessed immortal talents, yet only the Shen household could receive their alchemical secrets. Yu Shíshě, son-in-law to Wànshān, was a man of youthful generosity; Wànshān gave him his youngest daughter in marriage and transmitted the wondrous Dao of cinnabar, so that his wealth and prosperity rivaled that of his father-in-law. When Wànshān journeyed to Yunnan, Shíshě inevitably followed—no mere coincidence. Upon arriving in Yunnan, Xīpíng Marquis Mù Chūn treated him with deep kindness. Observing Yu’s daughter—her bearing refined and serene, her demeanor truly that of a transcendent—he wished to take her as a concubine for Shíshě, to which Shíshě consented. Yet upon entering the Xīpíng residence, the marquis, finding her dowry meager, treated her with scant courtesy. The Yu lady said, *"What you value is wealth—easily provided."* She instructed that mercury be heated, then cast her gold ring into it; a sound like a cicada’s cry arose, the true mercury evaporated, and the ring remained unchanged. When she used the mercury to polish copper and iron, all transformed into boundless golden treasures, much to the marquis’s delight.

During his seven-year governorship of Yunnan, the Xīpíng Marquis greatly expanded military colonies, and much of his success was owed to Lady Yu. Later, he sought a Daoist name from me and became my junior disciple, henceforth called Huìgāng, styled Jiànyáng. Together with her parents, she consumed the great medicine of Elder Wànshān and ascended in transcendence above the Kūnmíng Lake.

*Reed Bank Night Conversations*
The moon pale over the Yangtze, frost and dew blanketing the islets—did Master Wànshān’s disciples wish to hear of my origins? At my birth, a crane descended from the sea and sky, and all said it was Língwēi incarnate. Later, learning that Master Dīng still dwelled in the numinous realm, I thought: *He is human, and I am human—why should I not attain what he has?* Ever lamenting the fleeting nature of time and the impermanence of life, where wealth and honor are as transient as wind, lamp-flame, grass, or dust, I yearned day and night for the Great Dao. I abandoned fame and profit, renounced power and gain, and wandered rivers and lakes, seeking renowned masters. Though I received many teachings, all were peripheral minor arts, at odds with the true Dao, and my efforts were in vain.

In the first year of the Yányòu era, at sixty-seven years of age, my heart and fate grew anxious. Fortunately, Heaven took pity: upon first entering Zhōngnán, I encountered Master Fire Dragon, a lofty disciple of Elder Tú Nán, his bearing beyond the mundane. Kneeling, I sought the Dao, and moved by my sincerity, the master first instructed me in the work of refining the self, then revealed the oral formula for obtaining the medicine, and finally expounded on the subtleties of firing times, the nurturing of the embryo, and the principles of emptiness and completion. All was made clear. Thus I understood that to advance in the Dao, one must employ both method and resources. Though I had traveled widely and was inclined toward goodness, I had exhausted my coffers and emptied my chests—how could I fulfill my long-held vow? Unconsciously, my distress showed upon my face. The master, sensing something amiss, questioned me, and I, tears streaming, grasped his knee and confessed.

Having received the master’s gracious bestowal of the cinnabar-transmuting elixir, I was commanded to leave the mountain and cultivate it. I took leave of my benevolent teacher, veiling my light to mingle with the world, and set out to seek eight ounces of true lead and half a catty of true mercury. Together they entered the alchemical furnace, where through firing, refinement, and cyclical transformation, the nine revolutions were completed. With these resources, I would fulfill the great work.

Thereupon I built a crucible chamber, sat upright in solitude, emptied my heart to nurture qi, and stilled my qi to nourish spirit. As qi grew luminous, spirit became clear. I gathered medicinal ingredients far and wide, sipped wine of coiled peaches, and drank morning dew from the Jade Pool. Drunken yet lucid, I replenished qi and blood. Once half a catty of mercury was secured, eight ounces of lead would follow. As the lunar cycle neared completion, golden blossoms appeared of themselves. With ten hands I seized the tiger and captured the dragon, obtaining the primordial qi. Gradually I regulated the firing times, adding and withdrawing, naturally aligning with the celestial revolutions. I knew when to advance the fire at *fù* and retreat at *gòu*, and guarded against peril at *mǎo* and *yǒu*. After ten months, the sacred embryo manifested its form. Nine years of wall-facing, and I merged with the Dao in truth—just as the saying goes: *“Riding a crane through the azure vault as though on a broad highway, careless even if the blue seas turn to mulberry fields.”*

Such, in broad strokes, has been my journey.

Now let us take up the oars and sing together, to make this night’s joy complete!

The Four Elders of Shangshan—all were those who fled the chaos of Qin. The first was the Duke of Eastern Garden, surnamed Tang, named Bing, styled Xuanming, a native of Xiangyi. He maintained his lofty purity and secluded himself in gardens and hills, thus taking this as his title. The second was the Yellow Elder of Summer, by nature stern, named Kuo (or Guang in some texts), styled Shaotong. He withdrew to dwell in Xia Village to cultivate the Dao, hence styling himself the Yellow Elder of Summer. The third was the Master of Jiaoli, a man of Wu. A descendant of Taibo, surnamed Zhou, named Shu, styled Fudao. He roamed freely and contentedly, once residing in Henei, and later took the title Master of Bashang. These three are recorded in the *Records of Chenliu*, while Qi Li Ji remains unattested. Upon consulting Huangfu Mi’s *Biographies of Lofty Scholars*, I learned that the Elder of Qi Li was surnamed Zhu, named Hui, styled Wenli. He cultivated lingzhi to nourish life and dwelt among springs and rocks to preserve his true nature. Such was the pure breeze of the Four Elders!

**Preface to the Eight Ways of Reclusion**
Master Sanfeng, though repeatedly summoned by the imperial court, feigned reclusion to conceal himself deeply. With a sigh, he declared: “How wondrous is the use of reclusion! The Son of Heaven cannot make one his subject, nor the feudal lords his friend. One does not pay homage to lords and dukes, nor encounter the powerful and noble.”

He did not employ the arts of longevity to distract the sovereign’s resolve in governing with diligence. He sought for himself, applied for himself, attained for himself, and delighted in himself. From afar, he seemed like the white clouds drifting in the sky, ever-shifting in form; up close, he was like the bright moon reflected in water, rippling and elusive. Some concealed themselves amid the marketplace, others dwelt in mountain forests, still others mingled unseen among the common throng. Since the founding of the Great Ming, neither Taizu’s summons nor Chengzu’s search could reach him—was he a transcendent? A lofty sage? Or one who had attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal?

In his lifetime, he revered eight figures, once painting their portraits on scrolls and bowing before them. From the Han: Yan Guang and Fa Zhen; from the Jin: Tao Qian and Dai Kui; from the Tang: Lu Hong and Xuanyuan Ji; from the Song: Chen Tuan and Lin Bu. The *Yijing*’s *ninth line of the hexagram Dun* states: *“Abundant reclusion—nothing is not favorable.”* Could this refer to these eight masters?

Yan Ziling declined Emperor Guangwu, saying: *“When Yao of Tang embodied virtue, even Chaofu washed his ears. A scholar has his own aspirations—do not press me.”* Emperor Shun summoned the eminent Fa Zhen, who refused to appear. Guo Zheng remarked: *“His name may be heard, but his person is hard to meet. Fleeing fame, fame follows; shunning fame, fame pursues. He may serve as a teacher for a hundred generations.”* Dai Andao declined imperial appointments and fled into Wu; Tao Yuanming, of serene disposition, abandoned office to return to the wilderness. Emperor Xuanzong sought Lu Hong, offering rank to no avail, and Lu ultimately recluded himself on Mount Song. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang welcomed Xuanyuan Ji from Luofu and inquired about the Dao of immortality. Xuanyuan replied: *“A true king curbs desire and exalts virtue, naturally enjoying long-lasting blessings—why seek longevity further?”* Emperor Taizong of Song said to his ministers: *“Chen Tuan of Mount Hua cultivates himself alone, untouched by power or profit—he may truly be called a man beyond the world.”* When Song Qi and others asked him about the Dao of self-cultivation, Master Chen replied: *“A rustic like me is of no use in these times. You, sirs, should unite in virtue, promote culture, and govern well—this is the truest practice of cultivation.”* Lin Bu built his hut on Solitary Mountain and never left it, later receiving the posthumous title *Hereditary Tranquility*. These men were praised in the *Comprehensive Mirror* and commended in the *Outline of History*—unlike those who feigned reclusion on Zhongnan or fled to the northern mountains for mere show, they truly grasped the meaning of reclusion!

Now, those capable of lofty reclusion are themselves lofty immortals. Yet the alchemists and Daoist adepts of today clamor and jostle for advancement, flaunting their golden elixirs to deceive the sovereign. In the end, their fleeting delusions cannot escape swift heavenly judgment. Emperor Wu of Han favored immortals, and Li Shaojun gained entry—yet when his arts were exhausted, his head was displayed on a pike, and when Luan Da’s schemes failed, he was beheaded. Emperor Xianzong of Tang favored immortals, and Huangfu Bo prospered—yet before long, the Lis were executed, and shortly after, Liu Bi was put to death. As for Lin Lingsu and Wei Hanjin, who boasted of yellow and white (alchemy) and moved freely in and out of the palace—what became of them in the end under Emperor Huizong of Song? How grave it is! Petty men crave advancement, and mediocre rulers are often foolish.

How excellent were the words of Li Fan: "When the Dao flourishes and virtue abounds, the people are at peace and the state is well-ordered—what need is there to fret over the absence of a Yao or Shun’s longevity?" How excellent were Zhang Gao’s words to Emperor Muzong: "When the spirit is serene, blood and qi harmonize; when desires run rampant, illness and affliction arise. Medicine is for attacking disease—without illness, one must not partake of it." How excellent were Wang Zhaosu’s words to Emperor Taizu of Song: "To govern the world, nothing surpasses loving the people; to cultivate the mind, nothing surpasses reducing desires." How excellent was Pei Lin’s memorial to Emperor Xianzong, in brief: "Alchemists cannot be trusted. If true immortals exist, they must dwell deep in cliffs and ravines, ever fearful of being known. Those who hover at the gates of power, flaunting their strange arts, are all lawless men driven by profit."

Master Sanfeng was a true recluse, a true escapee. In conduct, he aspired to emulate Yan, Fa, Dai, Lu, Tao Qian, and Lin Bu; in admonition, he sought to follow the Yellow Emperor and Master Xiyi, embracing their loftiness. He wished only that those who sought him would forget him, and those who summoned him would abandon the summons. Thus would he vie with the Eight Recluses of old in transcendent withdrawal, becoming the great hermit of this sagely dynasty.

**Postscript to *The Imperial Edict Enfeoffing the Perfected Man of Penetrating Mystery and Manifest Transformation***

Since antiquity, those called "Perfected Men" must outwardly embody true qi, inwardly contain a true heart, uphold true integrity in society, and maintain true discipline in seclusion—only then do they truly attain it. The true Dao abandons the world without clinging to it, avoids people without being seen by them, is not shackled by power or profit, and does not deceive sovereigns with alchemical gold and silver. How could it resemble those practitioners of minor arts who falsely seek imperial decrees without shame?

From the Han to the Song, among those who grasped the subtle mechanisms—like the Eight Recluses I revere—their pure winds and towering integrity led them to flee fame, decline appointments, retire after accomplishing great deeds, or hide in times of decline. Their true essence remained concealed; how could they ever peddle longevity elixirs to the court?

From my youth, I was devoted to the profound principles of the Dao; in later years, I attained its true essence. Wild and unrestrained, I truly despised the vulgar. I hold that Perfected Men and True Lords, enfeoffed by the Supreme Emperor, are precious—what value is there in human imperial decrees? Only Emperor Yingzong of the Heavenly Compliance era, both enlightened and decisive, bestowed upon me this august mandate, which I accepted with utmost reverence.

Yet in the reigns of Chenghua and Jiajing, Tibetan monks like Zaba and the sorcerer-monk Jixiao were enfeoffed as National Preceptors and Chan Masters; alchemists such as Deng Changen, Li Zixing, Shao Yuanjie, Tao Zhongwen, Tang Zhi, and Liu Wenbin, along with hundreds of Daoist adepts, were all base and petty men—crafty, greedy, and treacherous. Falsely styling themselves as Dharma Masters and indiscriminately titled Perfected Men, they became laughingstocks in the historical records. At that time, worthless jade was confused with true gems, and fish eyes were mixed with pearls—I would never have accepted such a decree. Later, some were executed, others dismissed, their former titles revoked, leaving none unexposed. How gratifying! Was this not the Supreme Emperor’s solemn regard for imperial decrees, refusing to recklessly bestow them upon the unworthy, and silently stripping away their hollow titles?

**Written by the Old Daoist of the Great Yuan, Sanfeng**

**Memorial on the Concordance of Dao and Method to *The Ice Mirror of Ming***

I prostrate myself before the Great Dao, which is vast and relies on the Most High to transmit its mechanisms; its subtlety is most profound, and I hope the Quanzhen school will expound its teachings. Methods without the Dao lack their fundamental source; the Dao without methods cannot manifest its wondrous functions. Only when Dao and method are both complete do essence and function achieve perfect harmony.

I recall my time lodging with the Mingyu family, where I deceptively called myself Pang Dongchun, a wandering cloud from Tianshui, drifting through rivers and lakes. Lamenting the swift passage of days and months, I sighed over my advanced age; reflecting on my conduct, I found myself in the twilight of life. Sometimes I lingered in forests and valleys, sometimes I roamed secluded cliffs and streams. The books of Zhou and Kong I casually perused in my youth; the *Daodejing* of Laozi I loosely applied in my old age. With cloud companions and misty friends, I often set my mind on wandering beyond the world; with transcendent and extraordinary men, I received compassion for my constrained existence in the mundane. They pointed me toward the subtle and profound, obtaining the bellows of decay reborn; I trod this path, witnessing the unyielding blade of kalpas in the *Juan’e*.

Red lead and black lead, refined and tempered to form echoes and shadows;
Golden liquor and jade liquor, in sitting and lying, slightly attain free flow.
Though I have not yet reached the shore of the Dao’s completion,
I have surely galloped upon the track of the primordial origin.

Dragging my staff of bramble, I entered the grotto-heaven of Central Yang;
Inquiring of this Hua-Feng, it is the finest retreat of Inner Jiang.
Yesterday, Master Ice-Pot deigned to lower himself to seek the Dao,
presenting me with a jade-sealed letter, wholly devoted in sincerity,
and unfolding offerings of paper currency.
Though I first met his noble countenance,
I had long been familiar with his pure and refined voice.
The winds and thunders of the Six Jia he suddenly concealed within talismans and scripts;
The generals and officers of the Three Heavens were readily subject to his command.
Rescuing the distressed, aiding the imperiled, benefiting people and things.

You wish to bequeath this wondrous method to me—
how could I not offer you the primordial mechanism in return?
One text states: *"I was fortunate to encounter the crane’s neck and fish’s gills;
you, too, have met the calf’s nose and mouse’s ears."*
Like glue and lacquer, we are bound—how could parting be our fate?
With Dao and method conjoined, we forge an extraordinary bond.

Turning the body, I traverse the jade gourd,
heedless of east, west, south, or north!
Casually plucking the golden lotus,
ever abiding in spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

Since the immortal’s promise is granted,
I am deeply honored by your radiant discernment.

**Postscript to the *Preface to the Convergence of Dao and Method***

In my wanderings through the mountains of Inner Jiang,
I heard of the "Celestial Pass and Earthly Pivot,"
believing it must contain secret classics and numinous texts—
the very essence of nurturing nature and establishing destiny.
Yet upon ascending the Celestial Pass, it proved but a trifling mechanism of three pushes.
And when I sought the Earthly Pivot, it was merely Stone Bamboo Mountain.
Thus I sighed: *"Are not the world’s famed yet hollow things just like this?"*

I had heard that Master Ming was quite devoted to the Dao,
but upon accompanying him, found him utterly unremarkable.
He even wished to teach me talismans and incantations,
oblivious to the existence of the Golden Elixir—
how could this be called the Dao?
The Dao is inherent in the human body,
not some heterodox left-hand path.

First, learn stillness;
next, learn awakening;
then, learn refinement;
then, learn nurturance.
Only at the end does one emerge into the Qian and Kun,
coming and going to rescue and deliver,
diligently establishing merit and conduct,
awaiting the celestial mandate.

Thus, the Dao may encompass method,
but method cannot encompass the Dao.
Even if one employs wondrous arts to aid others,
it must be with the heart as method,
the spirit as talisman,
and qi as the force of water—
then, nothing applied will fail to be efficacious.
If one merely drives talismans and dispatches incantations,
restlessly and without cease,
sometimes effective, sometimes not,
bewildering the hearts of people,
the discerning will surely call one a mere "master of techniques."
When one day a yaksha comes to press,
and life hangs by a thread,
if talismans prove ineffective and incantations fail,
though one has long been called a Daoist,
where, then, is the Dao?

Therefore, those who wish to learn the Dao
must seek the Dao within the Dao itself,
and not mistake method for the Dao.
Preserve the spirit and transcend transformation—
then, there is no Dao that is not method.

**Postscript to the *Immortal Chess Game of Penglai***

The *Immortal Chess Game of Penglai* was composed by Longyangzi,
Leng Qian of Huxiang.
Qian, a native of Wuling, styled himself Qijing;
Longyang was his sobriquet.
In the early years of the Zhongtong era,
he associated with Liu Bingzhong of Xingtai, styled Zhonghui...

The monk Haiyun traveled widely. He read voraciously, with particular mastery of the *Book of Changes* and Shao Yong’s *Book of Supreme World-Ordering Principles*, and was versed in astronomy, geography, music, calendrics, and all manner of arts. In the mid-Zhiyuan era, when Bingzhong was appointed Grand Guardian and joined the Secretariat, Qian abandoned his Confucian studies. He roamed Xiaochuan, where he met Zhao Mengfu (styled Ziyang), a former Registrar of the Song dynasty, at the residence of Prince Shi Wei in Siming. There, they beheld a painting by the Tang general Li Sixun, which stirred something deep within Qian’s breast. He set about emulating it, and in less than a month, his landscapes, figures, and rock formations were indistinguishable from the general’s. His brushwork and coloring were even more delicate, conjuring a transcendent vision—thus, he gained renown in his time as a master of ink and color. While serving in Huaiyang, he encountered an extraordinary figure who transmitted to him the Great Elixir of the Central Yellow, revealing the profound insights of Peng Xiao’s *Awakening to Reality*. Qian grasped them instantly, as if they were his own creation. By the Zhizheng era, he was already over a hundred years old, yet his hair remained black and his complexion youthful, as if he were still in his vigorous prime. When the Red Turbans rose in rebellion, he took refuge in Jinling, dedicating himself daily to aiding others and benefiting all beings, his medical prescriptions and remedies working like miracles. After the founding of the new dynasty, he was falsely accused of painting a crane—a crime—and vanished into the wall as a transcendent. From that moment, no trace of his ink remained. This scroll was painted for me on the fifth day of the fifth month in the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era. I treasure it as if it were a jade of unparalleled value, never showing it lightly to others. Now, as I prepare to seek Master Leng among the Ten Continents and Three Isles, I fear that later generations may not recognize the sublime mastery of the landscapes and visions within his heart. Should they mistake this divine and extraordinary brushwork for that of some ordinary artist, I record this here. I now present it to the venerable Grand Preceptor Qiu, Duke of Qi, that upon viewing this scroll, his spirit may be refreshed and his qi invigorated, his thoughts drifting to the isles of Penglai. I urge him to treasure it well, as a token of our future reunion.

Signed on the third day of the first lunar month in the renchen year of the Yongle era by the Recluse of Sanfeng.

[Seal of Sanfeng appears below, as recorded in *Records of Extraordinary Figures of the August Ming*.]

According to the postscript in *Immortal Chess Game of Penglai* (also found in Caoqiao’s *Qixiu Leigao*), some have strenuously argued its inauthenticity, claiming: In the second year of the Yongle era, the scroll was presented to the Duke of Qi, a trusted minister of the Yongle Emperor—would Sanfeng have dared to conceal his visit? Further, the postscript states that Leng was from Wuling, yet he was in fact from Qiantang. Liu Bowen once met Qijing in Hangzhou, and even the *Gazetteer* records him as a native of Qiantang. Moreover, the postscript claims that after viewing Li Sixun’s painting, Leng mastered his technique and produced transcendent works, becoming renowned for his ink and color—why then does none of Liu Bowen’s poetry mention this, referring only to his skill in music and numerology? Additionally, if Sanfeng was a solitary wanderer, how could he have carried this painting to present it in the Yongle era? The postscript also states that Leng was already several hundred years old during the Zhizheng era—by the Hongwu era, he would have been over a hundred and twenty. Could one so old still serve as a minister? Even if he did, like Jiang Ziya or Fu Sheng, surely it would have been recorded—why does no text mention it?

Changyi responds: All five of Ying’s objections are groundless. This postscript’s language is lofty and untrammeled, unmistakably the hand of the immortal Sanfeng. As for its presentation to the Duke of Qi, it was merely to leave behind Leng’s painting. At the time, Sanfeng must have appeared and departed swiftly, like a crane’s elusive trace. The Duke of Qi had no need to conceal his visit, nor could the Yongle Emperor have hoped to detain him. First, immortals wander without fixed abode—if he was in Qiantang, he was a man of Qiantang; if in Wuling, then of Wuling. Why insist on a single origin? Second, though Liu Bowen met Leng, they were not constant companions, nor did he linger long. Even if he wrote poems, how could he have commemorated every encounter? Moreover, ink and color are minor arts—why would he praise them upon first sight? Third, a painting is not a cumbersome object, and presenting it was a gesture of respect. The Duke of Qi’s household was noble—surely he would have treasured it. Fourth, for immortals, a century is but an ordinary span. Serving as a minister in old age is no different from serving as an aged official—what doubt is there? ...

To Yuan Pu,

When your crane-borne carriage once visited me on Wudang, we sat upon my couch and spoke from the heart, utterly oblivious to the dusty world beyond. Yet my nature is restless, my heart set on saving the world, and like an untethered boat, I drift through the clouds and waters. You, too, had long been away from Mount Bai, and so you sheathed your sword and departed. Recently, I met your teacher, Master Wang Zhongdu, who praised your exceptional talent and keen insight, calling you the foremost among his disciples. He urged me, should I encounter you, to impart to you the true teachings. Alas! How could I presume to be your teacher? Yet I see in you a vessel of rare birth, destined to be guided by a host of immortals to become a leading figure of Penglai’s first rank. Your heroic spirit soars above the common, your ambitions towering—with the Green Snake in hand, you traverse the Nine Provinces, though I fear this may disrupt your tranquil cultivation. Mount Bai’s lofty depths are ideal for nurturing the embryo. If you can beget a son in the womb, and he in turn begets another, you may divide your body to serve the world without limit. Your wisdom is vast—I trust you will not find my words presumptuous. This humble advice, though slight, is meant as earnest counsel. If you deem me an old friend, that is enough.

The Cloud-Water Daoist Zhang Sanfeng bows in respect.

[Recorded in the *Yongle Encyclopedia*]

The earlier Confucians said: in reading, to take much is not as good as to take precisely. From the Son of Heaven down to the common scholar, the pursuit of learning is the same.

At the beginning of the Yongle reign, the court commanded Minister Hu Guang, Lecturer Wang Hong, and others to compile a work titled the *Great Encyclopedia*, comprising 22,879 juan in 11,095 volumes, with a sixty-juan catalogue. Its memorial text was once recorded in the *Cicada’s Refined Writings*. The *Imperial Digest* and the *Prime Tortoise* each contain no more than a thousand juan, yet those who seek abundance can only sigh in vain at the vastness. The *Great Encyclopedia* numbers in the tens of thousands—how could it ever be disseminated throughout the realm?

**Explanation of the Characters in *Awakening to Reality***
Alas! How is reality to be awakened? All in the world wish to awaken to reality, yet if their awakening is not real, it is no awakening; if reality is not awakened, it is no reality. Let us now clarify the meaning of the characters.

*Awakening* (悟) means to awaken and to seek. *Reality* (真) means the true and the correct. This much is known to all. But do they know that the written meaning of *awakening to reality* runs deep?

The character for *awakening* (悟) is composed of *I* (吾) and *heart* (心), teaching that cultivation must begin with refining the heart. As the Most High said: “Since time immemorial, I have observed the heart to attain the Dao.” Such is the way.

What, then, is *reality* (真)? The *Six Writings* state: “When a person receives qi at birth, the eyes form first, and where the spirit gathers, there is nothing that is not real.” Thus, the character is formed from *eye* (目) and *化*. *化* means transformation. It also takes the sound *hao* (浩), where *亠* represents the form of qi. From this, we know that those who seek to refine the Dao must first refine the eyes. Refining the eyes gathers qi, and refining the eyes also collects the heart—this is what is meant by “the mechanism lies in the eyes.” Recognizing this mechanism is true mechanism; recognizing this mechanism is knowing how to still the mechanism; recognizing this mechanism is entering the wondrous mechanism. To awaken thus is to be real thus. Let this be told to all in the world who seek to awaken to reality.

**Ode to the Knife and Ruler**
Master Sanfeng often carried a knife and ruler as he roamed, vast as the two great forces, boundless as the ten continents. A guest, perplexed by this, asked the reason, and the Master composed this ode:

This knife can cleave chaos;
This ruler can measure Penglai.
Thus they follow me without fail,
Knowing the tailoring of creation.

Behold its hundred points,
Twin forks like bright stars,
Its cord as white as snow,
Its edge sharp and true.
When it divides, it is swift as lightning;
When short, it fits just right—
Cutting water like clouds,
Swift as the decisive moment.
Its use is without limit,
Not confined to the small or fine.

To carve subtle principles,
To pare away the dust of clamor,
To measure the length of dawn and dusk,
To temper inch by inch with fire,
To gauge the breath of wind,
To nurture the embryo moment by moment,
To don a feathered robe and drift—
Scaling the Dragon Gate’s ten-thousand-foot height,
Like twin tiger swords.
Dreaming of Yizhou,
Yet unwilling to ascend with Fangzhang,
It soars beyond.

O knife! O knife! Wondrous beyond wonder!
O ruler! O ruler! Essential beyond essential!
Not Ou Ye’s smelting could forge it,
Not Gongshu’s craft could shape it.
It goes with me, heedless of mockery,
To seek the Weaver Girl’s cloud-silk,
And stitch the robes and hats of immortals.

Song:
A knife and ruler traverse the ends of the earth,
Homeless yet at home in the four seas.
A patched robe matches the drifting clouds,
While cinnabar is held within the sleeve.

**Preface to *The Essentials of the Mysterious***
Xuan Su laments that the span of human life is limited, while wealth and honor are fleeting—like a lamp in the wind or dew on grass, existence and extinction come in an instant. From ancient times to the present, this has ever been so, deeply worthy of alarm and reflection.

Thus, day and night, I yearned for the Great Dao, abandoned fame and profit, wandered lakes and seas, and sought out renowned teachers. Though I received much instruction, it was all from side doors and minor methods, bringing no benefit to body or mind. When I examined the alchemical classics, they too did not align, diverging from the Dao. My efforts were in vain, my nature and life in turmoil, and I never encountered a perfected one to fulfill my lifelong wish.

During the Yanyou era, by heaven’s grace, I first entered Zhongnan and met Master Fire Dragon, a senior disciple of Tu Nan. His temples were green, his complexion ruddy, and he stood apart from the world like a transcendent, his age unknown. Struck by wonder, I bowed and served him as my teacher, kneeling to inquire about the Great Dao. Moved by my sincerity, he first instructed me in the work of refining the self, then transmitted the oral formula for obtaining the medicine, and further revealed the subtleties of the firing process, along with the methods for warming and nurturing, the principles of embryo transformation, and the consummation of emptiness—all explained in full. Truly, this was mouth-to-mouth transmission, heart-to-heart instruction. To have heard such a teaching—what fortune could surpass it?

He also said that to achieve this Dao, one must employ both method and resources. Yet I, diligent in my travels and fond of good deeds, had emptied my purse and overturned my coffers—how could I accomplish this Dao? Unaware, my worry showed on my face, and the Master, sensing this, questioned me. I knelt again, weeping, and once more he took pity, teaching me the art of transmuting cinnabar and bestowing the medicine for quicksilver to stand firm. Thus, I left the mountain to dual-cultivate nature and life, then bowed in farewell to my benevolent teacher.

Thereafter, I blended with the world, seeking eight ounces of true lead and half a catty of true mercury. Together, they entered the furnace of creation, where I smelted the sun’s essence and the moon’s spirit, gathered the five phases, harmonized the four images, paired water and fire, balanced metal and wood, and congealed true earth. Through union and nurturing, transformation and division, three transcendences, and nine revolutions, I beheld yellow sprouts and white snow, bright mercury and transmuting elixirs—wonders beyond words. At this stage, how could I lack the means to complete the great work?

I chose a favorable site, built a thatched hut, and sat upright in a quiet chamber. Emptying my heart, I nurtured my spirit; calming my spirit, I cultivated my qi. When qi was refined and spirit clear, I then sought the crucible and vessel.

At dusk, I drank wine of pān-táo; at dawn, I feasted on waves of jade nectar. Drunken yet dazed, like an infant or newborn babe, I replenished qi and blood, warmed the cinnabar field, and reversed aging to reclaim youth—naturally sensing half a catty of mercury within. Only then did I await the eight ounces of lead. These measures required the moon’s full brightness, for the lead blossoms would then naturally reveal themselves. Seizing the moment, I captured the dragon and subdued the tiger, gathering that primordial speck of true lead to swallow into my belly, where it could dry my mercury. Gradually, with measured fire-tending, the proper weights and measures were observed. Once aligned with the celestial cycle’s count and the hexagrams’ unerring calculation, I advanced the fire and withdrew the talisman, knowing the return and union, guarding against peril by discerning the mao and you hours. After ten months, the sacred embryo manifested; after nine years of wall-facing, I merged with the Dao in truth. Mounting a crane, I ascended the azure heavens as though on a broad road, heedless of the seas’ transformation into mulberry fields—this was the hour of a great man’s accomplishment and renown.

Only then did I truly believe in this method of transcending the world. Though one might possess treasures like jade discs or outpace steeds with four horses, how could they compare to sitting and advancing in this Way? All this came from amassing hidden merits, repeatedly performing acts of kindness, and encountering a perfected being who brought it to fruition. By the grace of heaven, I, Xuán-Sù, was fortunate to achieve this. Though I dare not recklessly divulge the true transmission, neither dare I seal it in silence. Thus, I composed verses and discourses on the inner and outer elixirs of cultivation, compiling them into a record to awaken later learners, naming it *The Mysterious Essentials* and *The Essential Excerpts*. No other work more precisely captures the labor of practicing the Way, the oral instructions for attaining it, or the essence of its realization.

Should a determined scholar encounter this book, though they receive no direct transmission from Xuán-Sù, how would it differ from face-to-face instruction?

Written on the day after the full moon in the first autumn month of the guǐ-sì year of the Yǒnglè reign (1413), by the carefree Daoist Zhāng Sānfēng, styled Xuán-Sù.

In the mountains of Húnán, conversing with Attendant Hú by night:

Wāng Yuántōng said: "For nine years, Hú Yíng traveled on inspection, and while passing through Húnán, he rested in the mountains. One night at the third watch, when all was still, the tea had cooled and the lamp burned low, he suddenly heard a knock at the door. Presently, the door’s shadow opened of its own accord, revealing a Daoist whose appearance resembled Master Sānfēng. Hú was about to cry out in alarm, but the master swiftly covered his mouth and, brushing the table, spoke softly before departing. This matter was unknown to anyone in the Ming dynasty until yesterday, when the master descended to my summer retreat and recounted it. I now dip my brush to record it."

He said:

In his long sojourn through the realm, the venerable master has seen neither the dragon of Dǐnghú nor the steed of the empty valley—has not this journey been in vain? Yet moved by the bond of an old friend, I make bold to seek you out on this snowy night, arriving unannounced; pray do not be startled. Now the moon fills lake and mountain, the wind is pure in the lodge, the bell of the southern temple has faded, and the smoke at the western window has chilled—at this moment, does the master recall whether the old monk of Tiānchí was your former self? Say no more! Return to the court, and for my sake, conceal what should be concealed: what was seen, treat as unseen; what is known, treat as unknown. Thus may you avoid the exhaustion of carriage and steed, and spare yourself the toil of another ten-thousand-li journey. When you report back to the north, plan for next year. Along the way, present the people’s conditions to the imperial ear—this too shall be counted among the master’s virtues!

**Master Zhāng Sānfēng’s Four Principles for Recording the Recluse**
1. Those who conceal themselves in literary arts and Dao-learning, delighting in seclusion without emerging, are recorded as *chǔshì* (reclusive scholars), honoring their pure Confucian devotion.
2. Those who conceal themselves amid springs and rocks, their aspirations unwavering, are recorded as *yìshì* (recluses of leisure), honoring their steadfast integrity.
3. Those who conceal themselves amid times of order and change, resigning office without serving again, are recorded as *dáshì* (enlightened gentlemen), honoring their wisdom.
4. Those who conceal themselves in the gates of the mysterious and the pure land, unmoved by fame or profit, are recorded as *jūshì* (lay practitioners), honoring their pure cultivation.

The above four principles for recording the recluse truly capture the subtleties of appraisal—this is praise distilled into a single word. Some may ask: "Are not all four types recluses? Why distinguish them?" The answer lies in their *qi*-manifestations—whether in Dao-learning or refined leisure, in early retirement or shifting circumstances—each differs. Without such distinctions, their spirit and essence cannot be conveyed. Beyond these, categories like *gāoshì* (lofty scholars), *zhēngshì* (summoned scholars), *jiéshì* (principled scholars), and *yìshì* (righteous scholars) may all be subsumed under these four.

**General Assessment**
The calligraphic style of *Yǐn Jiàn* is pristine and archaic in every piece, its words simple and unadorned. It may be read as a brief biography of recluses—there is no need for exhaustive commentary.

*Yǐn Jiàn* by Master [Sānfēng]

The Master of Non-Existence
The Master was a great recluse of the Great Yuan, his conduct and concealment unfathomable—now absent, now present—hence his name. Born in the Yuan, he wandered through the Ming, his spirit roaming into the Qing. For six hundred years, he did not perish with the transformations of things.

Having traversed many ages and observed countless people, whenever he encountered those of lofty and steadfast aspiration, he delighted in commending them to others—not to compose a chronicle of recluses, but to weigh with those who wander freely among springs and rocks the proper balance of advance and retreat, of opportunity and timing.

The Master said: "The Dao of reclusion has two aspects. To withdraw in an age of decline is incompatible with serving a flourishing dynasty; to withdraw in a flourishing age is incompatible with exploiting reclusion to seize fame as a shortcut to office. Only thus do action and withdrawal align with propriety, and purity and loftiness find their record."

Hermits and rustics, as described above, were compiled into this volume, forming *Yǐn Jiàn*.

Liu Mengji
The Recluse Liu Mengji, styled Mengji, was a native of Rongcheng in Baoding.

Endowed with a nature of keen intelligence, he read books once and never forgot them. Initially devoted to classical studies, whenever he perused commentaries and exegeses, he would sigh, saying: "The profound subtleties of the sages cannot be exhausted here!" Upon encountering the teachings of Zhou, Shao, Cheng, and Zhu, he rejoiced, declaring: "I knew there must be such truths!" In daily life, he cherished Zhuge Kongming’s words, *"In stillness cultivate the self,"* and named his dwelling *"Jingxiu"* (Quiet Cultivation).

In the nineteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, an imperial edict summoned him to court, where he was appointed Left Rectifier of the Imperial Grand Secretariat. Citing his mother’s advanced age, he firmly declined, refusing even a single measure of the stipend. Later, when summoned again, he remained in reclusion and never emerged.

**Recluse Xiao Yizun**
The Recluse Xiao Yizun, a native of Fengyuan, initially served as a clerk in the prefectural office. When his words clashed with those in power, he promptly withdrew. For thirty years, he devoted himself to study without seeking official advancement. Once, a villager traveling at dusk encountered bandits; he deceived them, saying, *"I am Master Xiao,"* and the bandits, startled, released him and fled.

During the reign of Shizu, he was appointed Commissioner of Confucian Studies in Shaanxi but did not assume the post. Later, he was repeatedly offered the positions of Academician of the Jixian Institute and then Academician Reader-in-Waiting of the Jixian Institute, but he declined them all.

After some time, he was again appointed Right Mentor to the Crown Prince. Despite illness, he traveled to the capital and presented himself at the Eastern Palace, offering a calligraphic copy of *The Wine Admonition* as a gift, for the court at that time indulged excessively in drink. Soon after, he claimed illness and requested to resign, but his plea was denied. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to Academician of the Jixian Institute and Libationer of the National University, while retaining his previous title of Right Mentor to the Crown Prince. He again pleaded illness and firmly declined, then returned home. His friend Zhang Silian, upon hearing this, sighed and said, *"Unsullied and steadfast in his principles, worldly success and fame cannot sway his heart—Xiao may truly be called a man of lofty aspirations."*

**Recluse Qiu Shancun**
The Recluse Qiu Shancun, styled Yuan, was a native of Qiantang. He withdrew to wander rivers and lakes, mastering the classics and histories. During the Zhiyuan era, he was recommended as Instructor of Liyang, then transferred to Professor of the Baoqing Circuit, but he did not accept either post. Later, he was appointed Gentleman for Fostering Merit and Registrar of the Hangzhou Circuit Intendant’s Office, but he declined these as well. He lived beneath the western wall of Qiantang, composing under a thatched roof, secluding himself to craft verses. Sometimes he sat among flowers, speaking to himself and drinking alone. Once, his *Ten Poems on Leisurely Living* revealed a talent truly refined and self-possessed. Here are two of them, to glimpse the recluse’s spirit:

*Composing beneath the roof, my brush lacks strength,*
*Shutting the door to seek lines, my mind toils in vain.*
*Better to sit in silent darkness among the flowers,*
*Watching dragonflies and butterflies drift and glide.*

*Tea bowl and gauze hat—accustomed to greeting guests,*
*If not a poet, then surely a Daoist sage.*
*In slanting wind and fine rain, do not venture out,*
*Beyond the green shade at the gate, red dust swirls.*

**Free Spirit Qiu Yuanliang**
The Free Spirit Qiu Yuanliang, styled Wanqing, was a native of Huaihai. From youth, he embraced the aspiration to master the Dao, intending to achieve success and renown before withdrawing to seclusion. At the beginning of the Yuanzhen era, high officials recommended him as Rectifier of Omissions. After a long tenure, he lamented the constraints of office and abandoned all thought of official advancement, returning to Weiyang. A thatched cottage of a few rafters, pines planted and bamboo cultivated—he found the joys of a hermit’s life. One day, while gathering herbs in a deep ravine, he discovered a thousand-year-old *huangjing* root. After steaming and eating it, he felt his spirit and strength invigorated, able to ascend lofty peaks as if walking on level ground.

**Free Spirit Wu Boqing**
The Free Spirit Wu Boqing, styled Cheng, was a native of Chongren.

From childhood, he devoted himself to diligent study, composing works to expound the great Dao, and was truly a leading Confucian scholar of his age. He served the Yuan as a Hanlin Academician. At the beginning of the Taiding era, he claimed illness and returned home, shutting his door to lecture on the Dao. Though repeatedly summoned, he refused to serve, his reclusive virtue worthy of praise. Yet some criticized him for having been a provincial graduate of the Song dynasty. He was styled *Master Thatched Hut*.

**Chen Maoshu**
The Free Spirit Chen Maoshu, styled Li, was a native of Xiuning. By nature upright and filial, he devoted himself to the learning of the sages. At the beginning of the Yanyou era, he passed the provincial examination but did not proceed to the Ministry of Rites, instead teaching at home. For decades he never left his courtyard—was this not one who valued virtue and lightly esteemed fame?

**Du Boyuan**
The Recluse Du Boyuan, styled Ben, was a native of Qingjiang. Broadly learned and skilled in composition, he was once summoned to the capital during Emperor Wuzong’s reign but immediately sought to return, withdrawing to seclude himself in the Wuyi Mountains of Jianning. When Emperor Wenzong heard of his reputation, he was summoned but refused to come. During the Zhizheng era, the Chancellor Tuotuo recommended him, and he was appointed Hanlin Compiler. The emissary hastened to Hangzhou, but he again claimed illness and firmly declined. In daily life, he was serene and desireless, never speaking harshly or displaying anger. In his dealings with others, he was steadfast in Dao and righteousness. Scholars called him *Master Clear Jade*.

**Dai Ruyi**
The Recluse Dai Ruyi, styled Yu, was a native of De’an in Jiujiang. He lived in seclusion, accumulating learning, and declined all official summonses. He once said: *"Simplicity clarifies the will; tranquility attains the distant—this was Kongming’s lifelong study."*

Dai Ruyi accordingly composed *A Comprehensive Biography of Zhuge Liang* in three fascicles.

**Wu Bowei**
The Recluse Wu Bowei, styled Ke, was a native of Xuande. He was fond of reading the *Book of Changes* and would sit upright in solemn stillness each day. When asked, *"What do you take as the foundation of your learning?"* he replied: *"Stillness is the foundation."* His *Collection of Water and Clouds* circulated in the world.

**Zhang Guangbi**
The Perfected Zhang Guangbi, styled Yu, was a native of Luling. During the late Yuan, he served as Vice Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs and Vice Director of the Zhejiang Branch Secretariat, but when usurpers sought to recruit him, he refused to go. He passed his days in poetry and wine, styling himself *The Laughing Recluse*. In his *Spring Day* verse, he wrote:
*"A gust of east wind, a gust of chill—
the banana’s fronds outgrow the stone balustrade.
Just a few bouts of drowsy drunkenness,
and I watch spring’s light reach the peonies."*
This foretold the certain downfall of Zhang Shicheng. He once said: *"When I die, bury my bones by West Lake and inscribe: ‘Here lies the poet Zhang Guangbi’—that will suffice."* Later, it came to pass as he had said.

**Wu Yuanying**

**Wu Yuanying**
The Recluse Wu Yuanying, styled Lai, was a native of Jinhua. He lived in seclusion, never entering official service, and built his dwelling deep in the mist-laden mountains. Mastering the classics and histories to their utmost, he found contentment in quietude. Skilled in discoursing on literature, he once declared: *"Writing is like waging war—there must be both the orthodox and the extraordinary. The orthodox is method and discipline, like infantry ranks in clear formation; the extraordinary is unbound by method, endlessly transforming, with sitting, rising, striking, and thrusting all arising at once. Yet when the moment to cease arrives, each unit returns to its place, and never once is there disorder."* Those who heard him were convinced. His fellow townsmen Huang Jinqing and Liu Chuandao, also renowned for their literary prowess, were held in equal esteem by their age.

**Xu Baiyun**
The Recluse Xu Baiyun, styled Qian, was a native of Jinhua. From youth he devoted himself to study, apprenticing under Jin Renshan of the late Song, and after several years had plumbed the depths of his master’s teachings. Withdrawing into the Huashan mountains, he concealed his traces, nurturing his resolve in seclusion, seeking neither fame nor advancement. Though recommended by both court and countryside, he firmly declined all summons. Truly, he was at peace with fate and principle, no feigned recluse trading on reputation as a shortcut to office. In teaching others, he prioritized the cultivation of an enlightened mind and the transformation of one’s qi, yet never instructed them in examination essays, saying: *"Here lies the division between principle and profit."*

**Wang Yuanzhi**

The Scholar Wang Yuanzhi, styled Feng, was a native of Jiangyin. During the Zhizheng era, he was repeatedly summoned but declined all appointments. Fleeing turmoil, he settled in Wujing of Shanghai, where he built a thatched cottage and styled himself *"The Most Leisured Gardener."* He was the one the world called *"The Recluse in a Woven Hat."*

The Recluse Tao Zongyi, styled Zong, was a native of Tiantai. During the Yuantong era, he took refuge in Jilinli, south of Songjiang city. Fond of writing, he tilled the fields himself yet always kept brush and inkstone by his side. Beneath a tree, he placed an urn; whenever an insight came, he would write it down and toss it inside. Over time, these accumulated into volumes, which he titled *Nanjian Niegeng Lu*. During the Zhizheng era, he repeatedly declined official recommendations. In the sixth year of the Hongwu reign, he was summoned to the capital for his talents but firmly declined and was permitted to return home.

The Recluse Cai Qingzhen, styled Wei, was a native of Qiongshan. Well-versed in classics and history, he loved springs and rocks and remained in reclusion at the end of the Yuan. He built his dwelling deep in the mountains, and when scholars sought his instruction, they would bring a jar of wine and a pig’s shoulder to visit—he never refused to explain. People said no Confucian scholar in Hainan could surpass him.

The Recluse Gu Zhongyin, styled Dehui, was a native of Kunshan. Gifted with extraordinary talent and grace, he was generous with his wealth and fond of befriending guests. He built a villa west of Qianjing, constructing thirty-six pavilions and halls, which he named *"Jade Mountain’s Finest."* There, he gathered men of letters from all directions, hosting them with wine and poetry. After returning to Chuoxi for his mother’s mourning, Zhang Shicheng summoned him, but he shaved his head and built a hut by her grave, styling himself *"The Daoist of Golden Millet."* At the beginning of the Ming, hearing that the Taizu emperor was harsh and intended to suppress the wealthy clans of Jiangnan, he disguised himself as a monk and fled. His writings include *Jade Mountain’s Unpolished Drafts*, and he compiled over forty collections of poems by his acquaintances, titled *Elegant Gatherings of the Thatched Hall*, both of which circulated in the world.

The Recluse Li Gaogang, styled Mingfeng, was a native of Wu. Generous with his wealth and hospitable to guests, he was on par with Gu Zhongyin, and the scholar-officials of the southeast all held him in high esteem. Once, he supplied Zhu Yuanzhang’s army with twenty thousand *hu* of grain, yet remained indifferent, seeking no favor in return.

At the beginning of the Ming, due to the severity of the state’s laws, he arranged with the wealthy man of Jiading, Fang Erlang, to take their wives, children, and family wealth, and sail away by boat across the rivers and seas.

**Yang Lianfu**
The eminent scholar Master Yang Lianfu, styled Weizhen, was a native of Shanyin. He had passed the imperial examination in the previous Taiding era and was appointed magistrate of Tiantai. Later, he moved to reside in Songjiang, where he built the Yuanpu Lotus Terrace upon the waters of Songjiang. Scholar-officials from across the land and the talented literati of the southeast all deferred to him, flocking to his gate in droves. Once, he played an iron flute, performing *The Plum Blossom Melody*, and those who heard it took him for a transcendent being. The world called him *"Master Iron Cliff."* He wrote *On the Orthodox Lineage*, and readers universally regarded it as a just argument.

**Wang Shannong**
The recluse Master Wang Shannong, named Mian, was a native of Kuaiji at the end of the Yuan. Tall and heavily bearded, he had studied the classics in his youth but met with no success, so he burned his books. He read ancient military treatises, wore a tall hat, draped himself in a green straw cloak, donned long-toothed clogs, and wielded a wooden sword, singing as he walked through the marketplace. People took him for a madman of great talent and spirit, and they vied to associate with him. All his life, he was fond of painting plum blossoms, and whenever he finished a painting, he would admire it himself. When the Ming Taizu emperor heard of him and summoned him, he was served coarse rice and vegetable broth, which Shannong ate as he talked. The emperor was pleased and said, *"This is a man with whom I can share great affairs."* He offered him the post of Consultant Military Advisor, but Shannong declined.

One evening, he dreamed that the immortals of Mount Luofu summoned him. Upon waking, he seized his brush, cried out wildly, and painted a great plum tree. He inscribed a poem upon it, which read:

*"The tree by my ink-washing pool at home,
Each blossom blooms in pale ink’s trace.
Let no man praise its fair hue—
Only let its pure qi fill heaven and earth."*

The next day, he passed away. At the same time, the monk Pu’an, upon seeing his heart and seeing his work, declared, *"Wang Mian of Kuaiji is the Plum Blossom Immortal."*

The eminent scholar Ming Tianyuan, whose given name was Jun, was a northerner. During the reign of Emperor Shizu, he was a descendant of the Ming’an clan. His beard grew past his belly, and he carried himself with lofty elegance, standing apart from the crowd. He served the Yuan as a scholar-official, but when the dynasty fell, he shaved his head to become a monk—though his beard remained as before. In the early Hongwu era, Emperor Taizu, having heard of his reputation, summoned him and asked, *"You do not serve me, and I shall not compel you. But why shave your head yet keep your beard? Is there a reason?"* He replied, *"Shaving the head removes afflictions; keeping the beard marks a true man."* The emperor laughed and let him go. His writings, including *The Collected Works of Pu’an*, circulated in the world. He was one loyal to the Yuan yet attained the Dao.

The reclusive scholar Zhang Boyu, whose given name was Tianyu, was a native of Hangzhou and a descendant of Song Grand Tutor Zhang Jiucheng. His bearing was solemn and refined, and he excelled in both poetry and prose. He shared a literary friendship with Yang Zai and Yu Ji.

Later, he entered Mount Mao to study the Dao, where he encountered Chen Shangyang, who transmitted to him the teachings of pure cultivation. Inwardly serene, he gained realization and styled himself *"Outer Historian of Mount Juqu."*

The eminent scholar Yu Bogeng, whose given name was Ji, was a native of Linchuan. Endowed with divine intelligence, he could read by the age of three. In his prime, he bore a reputation for talent and served as Academician of the Kuizhang Pavilion, but soon resigned on grounds of illness. He admired Tao Yuanming and Shao Yaofu, and so constructed two study chambers: on the left wall of one, he inscribed Tao’s poems, calling it *"Tao Hermitage,"* while on the right wall of the other, he inscribed Shao’s poems, naming it *"Shao Hermitage."* Serene and untrammeled, he chanted verses in contentment. Contemporaries called him *"Master of the Two Hermitages"*—or simply *"Shao Hermitage."*

The eminent scholar Zhao Zichang, whose given name was Fang, was a native of Xiuning. At the end of the Yuan, he assisted Marshal Wang Tong in raising troops to defend their homeland and was appointed Director of the Jiangnan Branch Secretariat. In the second year of the Hongwu era, he was summoned to compile *The History of the Yuan*. After its completion, he declined office and retired to East Mountain. There, with one or two reclusive companions, he built a retreat by Clear Stream, moored his boat on sandy islets, and lived free of worldly dust. His classical scholarship was widely transmitted, and he was known as *"The Recluse of East Mountain."*

The eminent scholar Wang Defu, whose given name was Kekuan, was a native of Qimen. In the late Yuan, he lived in seclusion at Huangu Valley. At the beginning of the Hongwu era, he was summoned to compile *The History of the Yuan*. Upon its completion, he firmly declined office and retired as a Daoist recluse in the cliffs of Daoren Rock, where he delved deeply into classical studies. In teaching his disciples, he always emphasized stillness of mind and the cultivation of fundamental strength.

The reclusive scholar Xie Zilan, whose given name was Yingfang, was a native of Wujin at the end of the Yuan. He styled himself *"Old Man of the Tortoise Nest."* There were two Tortoise Nests—one by Lake Ge, the other on Mount Heng—each commemorated in his records. In summary, he wrote: *"A thousand-year-old tortoise nests in lotus leaves, using the leaves as its dwelling, requiring no effort of construction. At leisure, it wanders with farmers and rustics through mulberry and ramie gardens, past peach and plum paths, sharing earthenware bowls of unstrained wine, singing and dancing in exchange—like one dragging its tail through the mud."* Elsewhere, he wrote: *"Throughout my life, wherever I have gone, I have named my dwelling 'Tortoise Nest,' for I do not take beams and rafters as my nest, but the heavens and earth. Towering halls and carved walls know not their splendor; humble gates and earthen windows know not their simplicity."* Reading his words, one may sigh in admiration at his enlightened perspective.

The Old Man had once served the Yuan, but after its fall, he refused office. In his *Letter to Zhang Yunmen*, he wrote: *"A catfish on a bamboo pole—how laughable were the achievements of former years; a tortoise in lotus leaves—how fleeting this recent life has become. Compared to my mountain retreat and small garden, yours is far more transcendent."*

She Yuanji
Recluse Master Shen Yuanji, styled Zhen, was a native of Changxing. At the end of the Yuan, he withdrew to Mount Hengyu, styling himself *"Old Man of Tea Mountain."* At the founding of the Ming, he refused office, taking the yellow stones as his disciples and the white clouds as his companions, never emerging. Compared to those who come when beckoned and go when waved away, how vastly different was his character.

Xu Zhongyou
Eccentric Master Xu Zhongyou, styled Wei, was a native of Chunan. At the end of the Yuan, he was recommended as a *xiucai*, but at the founding of the Ming, he refused office, styling himself *"Resident of Pine Nest."* His mastery of song composition and tonal prosody rivaled the ancients. Once, in his *Man Ting Fang*, he wrote: *"Clear frost on the wattle fence, red leaves in the forest hills."* After Tao Yuanming of Pengze resigned his post, he no longer served princes or lords. His lofty integrity was as if measured out through the hole of a flute.

Huang Ziyun
Recluse Master Huang Ziyun, styled Shu, was a native of Xiuning at the end of the Yuan. At the beginning of the Hongwu era, he was summoned but exempted due to a lame foot, earning the nickname *"Master Clever Limp"* among his fellow villagers. At the same time, there was Lü Buyong, styled Zegeng, a native of Xinchang. In the second year of the Hongwu era, he was recommended as *jiaoyu* of his local school but declined due to deafness, styling himself *"Deaf Man of Stone Drum Mountain."* Both gentlemen were untrammeled by worldly conventions, embodying the noble spirit of mountains and forests.

Zhang Weizhong
Recluse Master Zhang Weizhong, styled Yong, was a native of Cixi. At the end of the Yuan, during the chaos of war, a usurper appointed him as *shanzhang* of Shangyu, but he refused. At the founding of the Ming, he was repeatedly summoned but never emerged, vanishing into the rivers and mountains, singing freely among the white stones. He exchanged poetry and wine with the scholar-officials of his time, but when urged to enter office, he politely declined. People said of him that his integrity did not sever him from the world, nor did his reclusion betray his kin—he was a man in the mold of Guo Linzhong.

Wang Zhongguang
Recluse Master Wang Zhongguang, styled Bin, was a native of Changzhou. Together with Han Yi of Wu County and Wang Lü of Kunshan, he was known as one of the *"Three Eminences of Wu."* His secluded heart was as desolate as drifting clouds, his resting mat set by the misty river. Once, in a linked verse with Gongwang, he wrote: *"I know my nature’s eccentricity resists following the vulgar, yet I rejoice in my idleness, unbound to others."* From these lines, one may glimpse their shared affinity for moss-covered peaks.

Chen Kechang
Recluse Master Chen Kechang, styled Zhou, was a native of Min County.

At the end of the Yuan, a commoner, he recluded himself at Stone Pool. Once, leaning against bamboo, he composed a song to express his aspirations. The song went:

*"Slender bamboo, so verdant,
Hollow within, upright without.
Unblemished integrity, steadfast bearing,
Unchanged through cold and heat.
Gurgling streams at dawn and dusk—
Where else could I find such fitting abode?"*

Liang Buyí
Recluse Master Liang Buyí, styled Lan, was a native of Taihe. He styled himself *"Master of Pleasant Fields."* Zou Zhongxi remarked that his reclusion delighted in the Dao, while Wang Xifan praised his nurturing of resolve amid gardens and hills. I see in him a self-contentment in his western fields, a leisurely air akin to Tao Qian, and a boundless spirit reminiscent of Wei Ye.

Cheng Tuanxiao
Gentleman Cheng Tuanxiao, styled Xiang, was a native of Xin’an at the end of the Yuan. After the Dao was made manifest, the transmission of Learning of the Way spread through the world. At the beginning of the Hongwu era, an edict was issued to seek out recluses far and wide. Some recommended Master Cheng, but he declined to rise. In the second year of Hongwu, the court again sought elders from the mountains and forests to compile *The History of the Yuan*. Once more, he was nominated, yet he never attended. Later, when an imperial decree summoned Confucian officials to compile ritual texts, Song Lian said, *"None but Tuanxiao is capable."* The memorial was submitted, but the Emperor, unwilling to compel him, ordered that he be consulted at his home. When urged to serve, he merely smiled without reply, saying only: *"An earthly rank cannot compare to the nobility of Heaven’s rank; what are achievements and fame beside the loftiness of the Dao’s name?"* Thereafter, he concealed himself deeply and never emerged, drawing comparisons from the court to the recluses of Shangshan.

Xu Fangzhou
Recluse Master Xu Fangzhou, styled Fang, was a native of Tonglu at the end of the Yuan. Fond of poetry and lyrics, he built a hut by the riverbank, where water, bamboo, clouds, and mist aided his chanting and whistling. When Liu Bowen was summoned, he invited Fangzhou to accompany him. Fangzhou, clad in a straw raincoat, met him, and they drank wine and composed poems before parting.

Han Gongwang
Gentleman Han Gongwang, styled Yi, was a native of Wu. Born during the Zhishun era of the Yuan, he grew to love reading, perusing all manner of texts. In his youth, he suffered from an eye ailment. Casting a divination, he drew the *Meng* hexagram and knew his illness could not be cured. Thus, he named his chamber *"Meng Studio."* During the Hongwu era, he abandoned all thought of official service. When the prefect, Yao Shan, pressed to meet him, Yi set sail into Tai Lake, drifting among the misty waves at his leisure. Yao sighed, *"This is what is meant by a man whose name may be heard, yet whose person cannot be seen."*

Jiao Shimou
Recluse Jiao Shimou, styled Mou, was a native of Jiangyin. He had been an old acquaintance of the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming. When the emperor established his capital at Nanjing, he thought of him daily and repeatedly summoned him, but Shimou did not come. Preparing to send envoys to fetch him, Shimou suddenly appeared, carrying chickens and pork, along with village wine, entering by the imperial road. Delighted by his arrival, the emperor entrusted the provisions to the Court of Imperial Entertainments to prepare a feast, and they drank together with great joy. Before the feast, three belts—one of gold, one of silver, and one of horn—were presented, and Shimou was bidden to choose one as a token of official appointment. He took the horn belt and was thereby granted the rank of *qianhu*. Shortly after, he walked straight out of Gaoqiao Gate, hung his official cap and belt on a tree, and departed.

Sun Taichu
Recluse Sun Taichu, styled Yiyuan, was a man of the early Ming. His bearing was elegant and luminous, his movements strange and elusive. He wore an *yuan* cap and a white unlined robe, always accompanied by an iron flute and a gourd ladle. Wherever his lofty spirit alighted, scholars and officials were moved by him. He once dwelled on the summit of Mount Taibai, calling himself the "Taibai Mountain Man." He also journeyed west to Mount Hua, south to Mount Heng, east to Mount Tai, and north to Mount Yi. In the south, he wandered through Wu and Kuaiji, lingering long without departing. Together with Liu Lin, Long Kuan, Lu Kun, and Wu Xuan, he was known as one of the "Five Recluses of Tiaoxi."

Wang Tinggui
Recluse Wang Tinggui, styled Gong, was a native of Changshu in the early Ming. He built his home north of Mount Yu, beside Xiaoxi Stream, where he planted ten thousand bamboo stalks and roamed leisurely among them. His carefree spirit was as cool and refreshing as his poetic sensibility was ethereal and distant. People said he was like autumn moonlight or spring clouds, inspiring reverence.

Master Wang
Recluse Master Wang, whose name was concealed out of loyalty and integrity...

In the early Yongle reign, he took up residence on East Mountain in Dongyang County of Jinhua Prefecture, styling himself "The Great Fool." His bearing was striking and majestic, his wit and understanding extraordinary. Clad only in hempen robes and a bamboo hat, he refused conventional attire, wandering daily among the villages south of the mountain, singing wildly to his own contentment. Those who feasted and roamed with him knew not his surname. Only when in the company of those surnamed Wang would he address them as "elder clansman," and so he came to be called Master Wang. Once, he said to the villagers: "When I die one day, I ask only that you gather my remains and hang them from the treetops." At times, he was also known as "The Woodcutter of Yuhua Mountain." Upon hearing of him, Zhang Sanfeng sighed and said: "This is a loyal minister of the Jianwen Emperor."

Xu Yanzhi
Recluse Xu Yanzhi, styled Boling, called himself "The Bamboo-Hat Master." A native of Qiantang, he possessed a quick and subtle nature, remembering every book he read at a glance. Yet his temperament was carefree and unrestrained, indifferent to minor conventions. When receiving guests, he often went barefoot with his hair unbound, his inner garments loose and trailing, much to the amusement of others.

Scholars and officials who came admiring his reputation would grow weary of associating with him after a single meeting, yet his vast talent and lofty spirit could never be obscured. By nature, he delighted in reclusion and was especially skilled at playing the zither. His writings include *The Correct Scores of the Great Sound*, *The Delights of the Drunken Peach*, *The Fragrant Terrace Collection*, *The Essence of Bookworms*, and *Manuscripts from the Hall of Old Rain*—was he not one whose exterior seemed rustic yet whose inner self was refined?

Wang Yuanfu
Recluse Wang Yuanfu, styled Yu, was a native of Leping in Raozhou. Well-versed in the classics and history, he delved deeply into the study of principle. Though the imperial court repeatedly summoned him, he refused to answer. Dwelling in secluded valleys, he remained serene and unperturbed. In the early years of the Xuande reign, he was again summoned for his mastery of the classics but firmly declined and returned home. His works include *Records of Words and Deeds* and other writings. Scholars called him "Master of the Pine Hollow."

Yu Guzhang
Recluse Yu Guzhang, styled Hangzhi, was a native of Fuyang. He lived in reclusion among hills and gardens, his name renowned across lakes and seas. Officials traveling through Zhejiang all wished to glimpse his countenance as a great joy. During the Zhengtong era, provincial and regional officials successively submitted memorials recommending him, but he never rose to the occasion. When relatives and friends urged him, he feigned deafness to decline. He wandered leisurely through mountains and marshes, sometimes conversing with trees and rocks as if in a mad or deranged state, so that people ultimately did not believe in him. One day, the Prefect of Wu in Hezhou again sought to recommend him, and the Master firmly declined with a poem:

*"The path to high office stirs thoughts of the coarse robe,
Yet distant Hezhou’s summons brings weary toil.
A lesser steed cannot follow the thousand-mile horse,
And empty fame may mislead even Jiu Fanggao.
Ji Kang trusted his indolence to suit the times,
Who says the Shaoshi’s price is set too high?
Though spring’s warmth may stir the Zhou flute’s breath,
The autumn wind has already silvered my temples."*

The Recluse Master Xu Mianren, styled Shu, was a native of Ningbo. During the Zhengtong era, he gained renown for his mastery of ancient prose. Scholars of literary refinement in eastern Ningbo all flocked to his gate to study. Dwelling amidst mountains and marshes, Master Xu refused to linger with any seeking fame, even if they were old friends. When young men among them admired the reclusive life, he would encourage them, saying: *"Green temples and blue mountains are perfectly suited to set each other off—Yan [Hui], Min [Sun], Yi [Yin], and Zhou [Gong] each followed their own Way."*

Later, he received repeated imperial summons but declined them all. He moved his family to Hangzhou and ultimately devoted himself to writing for the rest of his life.

The Recluse Master Xu Danchu, known as the Fisherman of Weixi, was another such figure. In the Zhengtong era, at the age of ninety, he suddenly abandoned his home to study the Dao, vanishing without a trace. A contemporary of the same age, Shi Neihan of Tongcheng, lived by Stone Pond north of the city walls. He lived to one hundred and three, with many children and grandchildren. On his hundredth birthday, he composed a poem in remembrance of Danchu:

*"Where did we keep our vow in Gengshen’s year?
Alone I chant verse in Jiawu’s spring—our shared birth."*
He, too, was a Jian Keng of the Ming.

The Recluse Master Shen Qinan, styled Zhou, was a native of Changzhou. During the Jingtai era, he was recommended as a worthy and good man but firmly declined the summons. He was known as the "Old Man of Stone Field."

Beyond poetry and prose, he excelled further in painting rocks—lofty, ancient, pure, and extraordinary—his brushwork mirroring his character.

The Recluse Master Fang Yuansu, styled Taigu, was a native of Lanxi. He called himself the "Master of Cold Stream." His spirit was clear and vast, untrammeled and transcendent. When asked, *"What does the Master do?"* he replied:
*"Ten thousand scrolls of books and paintings pass the days and months;
A bend of gulls and egrets shares my dawns and dusks."*

The Recluse Master Cheng Shupeng, styled Xuanfu, was a native of She County. He roamed forests and springs, singing and whistling, seeking neither fame nor advancement. The magistrate of his county knew Li Xianji but not Shupeng—such was his joy in obscurity. He called himself the "Daoist of Dragon Valley."

The Recluse Master Qin Zhongfu, styled Shi, was a native of Wuxi. His nature was supremely filial. When his father, the Reverent Xiujing, suddenly suffered heart pain, Zhongfu cut his chest, mixed his blood with wine, and gave it to him to drink. When his mother, Madam Yin, accidentally injured her knee, he sucked the wound and it healed at once. The prefecture and county reported his deeds, and an imperial edict commended his gate as *"Filial Son."* When the Emperor of Tailing ascended the throne, he was granted an official cap and sash.

The Master once built the Hall of Pure Inspiration Amid Streams and Mountains and the Pavilion of Limpid Distance, and behind them erected a pavilion named *"Dispelling Care."* His poem *"Strolling the Stream Bridge"* serves as a portrait of Zhongfu’s character:

*"Sweeping the pavilion, I read with unwaning delight,
Beneath green shade, the clear day stretches leisurely.
Leaning on my staff, I pace the stream’s bridge,
Gazing upon the ten-mile hills south of the lake."*

**Dong Luoshi**
Master Dong Luoshi, styled Yun, was a native of Haining. Renowned among rivers and lakes for his poetic skill, at sixty he traveled to Kuaiji and met Yangming. Their conversation spanned days and nights, after which he begged to become his disciple. Yangming refused. Luoshi returned home and wove a bolt of silk as an offering, saying, *"My sincerity has accumulated like these threads."* Thereupon he bowed and joined Yangming’s circle. His disciples urged him, *"Why do you weary yourself so in old age?"* He replied, *"I follow only what I love."* Thus he named himself the *"Daoist Who Follows His Heart."*

**Wu Kangzhai**
The Recluse Master Wu Kangzhai, styled Yubi, was a native of Chongren. He journeyed to the capital and studied under Yang Pu, whereupon encountering the profound origins of the Lu-Wang school, he harbored the aspiration to befriend the sages of old. Taking the worthies as his certain teachers, he gathered in his body and mind and championed the illumination of principle. In the second year of Tianshun, an imperial summons brought him to the Hall of Literary Splendor, where he was appointed Left Attendant of the Eastern Palace and Left Instructor of the Heir Apparent. He declined the post. The emperor sought to compel him to serve, but he refused thrice.

He then claimed illness and returned home, where he shut his gates to lecture on learning, with followers numbering in the thousands. He styled himself the *"Kangzhai Recluse."*

**Lou Kezhen**
The Recluse Master Lou Kezhen, styled Liang, was a native of Shangrao. In his youth, he traveled in the company of Wu Kangzhai. His learning took the gathering of the scattered mind as the gateway to reverent attention, and *"neither deliberating nor scheming, neither forgetting nor forcing"* as its essential tenets. Wang Yangming once received instruction from him. He styled himself the *"Master of One Studio."*

**Chen Baisha**
The Perfected Master Chen Baisha, styled Xianzhang, was a native of Xinhui in Guangdong. Having passed the provincial examination, he immediately withdrew into seclusion. Upon hearing that Wu Kangzhai was lecturing on learning in Linchuan, he abandoned his former studies to follow him. In teaching others, he did not rely on words or texts, taking stillness as the foundation and recognizing Heavenly Principle in all circumstances, with the crucial point being *"neither forgetting nor forcing."* He further said, *"The scholar takes spontaneity as the宗, self-forgetting as the great, and desirelessness as the ultimate."* The Provincial Administration Commissioner Peng Shao and the Governor Zhu Ying, having heard of his reputation, jointly memorialized the throne to recommend him, petitioning for his recruitment with propriety. A certain Minister of Personnel argued that Xianzhang, by precedent, ought to be subject to selection and was no mere recluse—why employ recruitment? Summoned to the capital, he was ordered to take the Ministry of Personnel’s examination. Xianzhang pleaded illness and did not attend, begging leave to return home to serve his mother. He was then appointed Hanlin Academician. Thereafter, he repeatedly declined imperial summonses.

**Xue Jingxuan**

Scholar Xue Jingxuan, styled Dexian, was a native of Hejin in Shanxi. Having passed the imperial examinations, he served as Vice Minister of Rites. During the Tianshun era, he spent several months in the Grand Secretariat but, witnessing Shi Heng and others wielding power, sighed and said, *"The noble person perceives the subtle and acts—he does not idle away the day."* Thereupon, he resigned his post and returned home, retiring to seclusion in the Longmen Mountains. His learning took the recovery of original nature as its core, his self-cultivation profound and meticulous, his words and deeds all worthy of emulation. He authored *Records of Reading* in twenty volumes, which scholars revered as authoritative.

**Zhang Haiguan**
Recluse Zhang Haiguan, styled Xishi, was a native of Qiantang. In the renwu year of the Tianshun era, he passed the provincial examinations but failed to succeed in the metropolitan examination, whereupon he was appointed Instructor of Shanyin. Soon after, he retired to the forests and springs. At home, he had several bamboo stalks, within which he built a pavilion named *"Curing the Vulgar."* He also wrote a preface in praise of it, which read in part: *"My desire for leisure having proven incurable, I hung my official cap at the Gate of Divine Might, nearly twenty years ago. Later, I became an old gardener at home, planting several hundred clumps of bamboo, each standing tall with stalks like whips and nodes like staffs. Amidst them, I built a small pavilion with six pillars, thatched with straw, embodying the essence of rustic simplicity. Seated in this pavilion, the clear sounds of bamboo chime like jade, curing the ears of clamor; the delicate fragrance soothes the nose of coppery stench; the clustered leaves, lush and green, cleanse the eyes of dust and haze; the bamboo shoots serve as tea and dishes, curing the mouth of gluttony; and the hollow heart and unyielding nodes may yet cure those who are self-satisfied and lose their integrity. Thus, I borrowed a line from the old poet Su [Shi] and named it the *Pavilion for Curing the Vulgar.* Alas! If there are those who dwell in lofty halls with painted beams yet remain vulgar in spirit, why not visit this pavilion even once?"*

**Jin Yuanyu**
Recluse Jin Yuanyu, styled Cong, was a native of Shangyuan. He once traveled to Chicheng Mountain in Zhejiang, lingering there and unwilling to leave, whereupon he styled himself *"Farmer of Chicheng Mountain."* In his dwelling, he often let out long, carefree whistles and gazed into the distance, leaving others unable to fathom him. In his personal conduct and interactions with others, he was lofty, unassuming, pure, and refined. Together with Shi Chiweng, he was known as one of the *"Two Recluses of Jinling."* Chiweng, whose given name was Zhong, was of a bold and uninhibited nature, refusing to serve the powerful. He styled himself *"Chiweng"* and named his residence *"Tower of Reclining Madness."*

**Tang Bohu**
Scholar Tang Bohu, styled Boyan, was a native of Wu. He ranked first in the southern provincial examinations but was later unjustly implicated and barred from office, whereupon he indulged in a life of unfettered wandering—yet his spirit moved between heaven and earth. When Chen Hao admired and sought to employ him, Bohu, discerning Hao’s rebellious intentions, feigned madness to escape. His extraordinary spirit overflowed, sometimes expressed in poetry, sometimes in painting. His literary brilliance and romantic charm illuminated the lands south of the Yangtze, and a stone was inscribed in his honor proclaiming him *"The Foremost Romantic Talent of Jiangnan."* In his later years, he turned to the Buddhist path and styled himself *"Resident of the Six As."*

**Luo Dafu**
Scholar Luo Dafu, styled Hongxian, was a native of Jishui.

Sir Luo Dafu, having ranked first in the metropolitan examinations, was appointed as *Zan Shan* in the court. He memorialized the throne to establish rites for the Eastern Palace in advance, but this offended the emperor’s will, and he was stripped of his post and returned home. There, he secluded himself, refusing to emerge. He carved out a stone grotto to dwell in, fashioned a half-couch, and sat in silent meditation for three years, able to foresee events before they occurred. He once said: *"One must not mistake fleeting visions for true attainment. Daily, one must gather and refine the self, lest the habitual tendencies of acquired nature seize the moment to arise anew—only then will a lifetime not have been lived in vain."*

**Zhao Huaixian**
Recluse Zhao Huaixian, styled Jin, was a commoner of Wucheng. During the Zhengde era, he was summoned by imperial decree but refused to answer. Those who sought his door found themselves led into deep ravines and secluded gorges. He would often sit in a small skiff, drifting upon rivers and lakes, content in solitary joy. The two ministers Nanyuan and Ruoxi formed the Jian Mountain Society and came to his hut to invite him to join, but he declined. Throughout his life, he cultivated tranquility and nurtured serenity. At the age of ninety, he composed his own funeral elegy and passed without illness.

**Shen Zideng**
Recluse Shen Zideng, styled Shi, was a native of Hangzhou and the son of Shen Rui, Vice Minister of Justice in the Ming court. Though born into nobility, his heart yearned for purity and truth.

Clad in rustic garb amidst the mountains, he would let forth long, resonant whistles. He styled himself "Green Gate Mountain Man," setting this example to admonish the worldly clans enamored of fleeting splendor.

**Chen Qiwei**
Recluse Chen Qiwei, styled Tiwen, was a native of Jiangyin. He built a thatched cottage west of the city outskirts, where he tilled several dozen *mu* of land to sustain himself. Whenever guests arrived, he would invariably prepare wine, and when the wine flowed freely, he would compose poems. One of his verses reads:

*When fish is caught, then wine is bought;*
*With wine at hand, guests are detained.*
*Such is joy—why pine for wealth?*
*Without fish or wine, the host fares best;*
*The guest fares ill—so let him rest.*
*Thus lying abed, why fear the dawn’s delay?*

Truly the words of one who has attained understanding. Among his contemporaries were the "Five Peaks" and "Ten Peaks" mountain recluses, most of whom aped the airs of the gentry in coarse cloth, a most contemptible affectation. Amidst the fields, he alone preserved his unfeigned nature.

**Gu Yingyu**
Eccentric Gu Yingyu, styled Liyu, was a native of Shangyuan. Having risen to the rank of Vice Commissioner, he promptly retired to seclusion in Baixia. Some questioned his early retirement, asking how he could sustain his integrity in retreat. He replied, *"Were my official purse filled, that would hardly be the way to nurture purity."* He dwelt in a small attic, which he inscribed with the name *"Cold Pine."* He once taught young students to support himself. When Minister Huo Weiya sought to bestow upon him a hundred *mu* of abandoned temple fields, he firmly declined. Such was his steadfast resolve in poverty.

**Zhu Junzuo**

**Zhu Junzuo**
Eccentric Master Zhu Junzuo, styled Jian, was a native of Yueqing in Wenzhou. Having risen to the rank of Vice Commissioner, he promptly resigned his post and returned home. He built a hermitage in the Yandang Mountains, where he dwelled with the untroubled air of one beyond the dust of the world. When some urged him to reenter official life, he replied, *"How could I trade my five treasures for five pecks of grain!"* The five treasures were Dragon Abyss tea, Singing Bamboo, Gold Star herb, mountain yam, and mandarin fish—all native to Yandang. Such were the gifts of the mountain he cherished.

**Master Xu**
Eccentric Master Xu Chang was a native of Chong’an in Min. He devoted himself to the study of principle and served as Instructor in Ming Classics in Putian. After mourning his parents’ passing, he returned home and, once the mourning period ended, refused to take office again. When urged to resume his career, Xu wept and said, *"I sought official stipends only to support my parents. Now that they are gone, what use is office to me?"* He built a retreat in the Wuyi Mountains and remained in seclusion, never emerging.

**Lai Yixian**
Eccentric Master Lai Qutang, styled Yixian, was a native of Liangshan in Shu. Renowned for his perfect conduct, he passed the provincial examination during the Jiajing era but declined to take office, choosing instead to care for his parents. His learning took the extension of knowledge as its foundation and the cultivation of human relationships as its essence.

Officials memorialized his virtues and recommended him for appointment as a Hanlin Academy Attendant, but he declined to assume the post. Throughout his life, his writings were vast, yet only his *Commentary on the Book of Changes* consumed his utmost effort. He first studied the *Changes* at Fushan Thatched Hall, yet after six years could not even glimpse its gateway. Thereupon he journeyed as a distant sojourner into the depths of Qutang’s mountains in Wan County, immersing himself in deep reflection, forgetting food and sleep. After a long time, enlightenment suddenly dawned, and only after twenty-nine years did he complete the work. Thereafter, in observing heaven and earth and examining the workings of creation, he moved without friction among things, abiding in effortless self-possession.

**Luo Zheng’an**
Recluse Master Luo Zheng’an, named Qinshun and styled Yunsheng, was a native of Taihe in Jiangxi. Though the court repeatedly summoned him, he never accepted office. During the Jiajing era, he was again nominated for Minister of Personnel, but firmly declined. At that time, when [Zhang] Cong and [Feng] E held power, Zheng’an dwelt in seclusion among the cliffs, shutting his gate to devote himself to the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge. He once said, *"To establish oneself and act in the world, one must first break through the barrier between rightness and profit—otherwise, one will remain forever entangled."* His writings include *Records of Knowledge Painfully Acquired*.

**Xie Zipei**
Eccentric Master Xie Zipei, named Yan, was a native of Fushun. A Jiajing-era *jinshi*, he served as Assistant Magistrate in Zhejiang, then returned home to care for his parents and never reemerged. In the early Wanli era, Provincial Governor Zeng Xingwu memorialized that Yan had lived in seclusion for thirty years, delighting in the Dao through writing, and deserved a capital-rank appointment to encourage recluses in the mountains and forests. An edict was issued to confer the title of Vice Minister of the Court of the Imperial Stud at his home. Contemporaries called him *"The Vice Minister in the Mountains."*

**Lu Zichuan**
Eccentric Master Lu Zichuan, named Shidao, was a native of Changzhou. He passed the *jinshi* examination during the Jiajing era. Having just begun his official career in the Ministry of Rites, he immediately resigned to care for his parents—this when he was not yet thirty.

Du shut his gate and swept no paths for over thirty years, hand-copying several thousand volumes of classical texts. Refined and erudite, he was revered by the world, yet his purity and devotion to the Dao surpassed all others.

**Li Yinnan**
Recluse Li Yinnan, styled Ziji, was a native of Macheng in Huanggang. During the Wanli era, when the age favored harsh strictures, he became an old gardener and never emerged. At the time, taxes in the two Guang provinces were repeatedly increased, and people across the south and north often bore the pallor of starvation. Yinnan composed *The Old Gardener’s Lament*, saying:

*"Alas, my garden—you and I endure still;
Alas, you worms—do not gnaw my vegetable roots.
Mince and porridge, mince and porridge—
Such is the fare of those above,
Not meet for rustics like me."*

Those who heard it all sighed in sorrow. Once, while hoeing, he unearthed a statue of a dragon deity and venerated it morning and night with utmost reverence. Suddenly, he dreamed of a figure in golden armor with a jade-green face who spoke with him briefly. Thereafter, his predictions of future events proved as swift and sure as an echo. One day, he told his younger brother and son: *"Now the three great bandits of Shu have been pacified. The worthy withdraw from the world; the next best withdraw to another place."* Then, turning his back on the deity, he vanished into the Sichuan wilderness.

**Yu Changru**

The scholar Yu Changru, styled Chunxi, was a native of Qiantang. A *Wanli* era *jinshi*, he served as a secretary in the Ministry of Personnel. After resigning his post, he found solace in the scenic beauty of Ge Hill and Qixia, wandering through mist in wooden clogs, ever content. Huang Yunyong recorded of him: *"He embodied Confucian conduct, cultivated the mysterious as his practice, took Chan as his refuge, entrusted himself to mountains and rivers, and made literary arts his play."* Truly, this encapsulates his life.

The scholar An Wosu, styled Xifan, was a native of Wuxi. He too served as a secretary in the Ministry of Personnel but was dismissed for his outspoken views. Upon returning home, he shut his door and never ventured out—when he did, it was aboard a single boat, where he painted the likenesses of Tao Yuanming, Zhang Jiying, Su Dongpo, Mi Nan’gong, and other renowned worthies upon the windows, making them his companions amidst mist and water. He roamed freely, delighting in his wanderings and forgetting to return.

The scholar Yao Gongshou, styled Shou, was a native of Jiashan. Rising from the post of censor to become prefect of Benning, he resigned and returned home, where he built the *"Rainbow Moon on Azure River"* boat. Sailing between Wu and Yue, those who glimpsed him took him for a transcendent being. At home, he constructed pavilions and halls, naming them *"Red Mound"*—people thus called him *"Master of Red Mound."*

The recluse Zhou Shuda, styled Yi, was a native of Jinchi in Dian. From childhood, he was remarkably precocious, and as he grew, his demeanor deepened in gravity. His learning took *"knowing when to stop"* as its ultimate principle. He tilled the land to support his mother, untouched by the allure of power or profit.

Once, he encountered a Daoist alchemist who wished to teach him his arts. Yi replied, *"What use is gold in abundance? Inner elixirs—how do they compare to few desires? Outer elixirs—how do they compare to frugal use? Desist! I am a Daoist of the Confucian gate, and my path of refining essence for grand use has long been established."*

The scholar Lu Siduan, styled Chengyuan, was a native of Pinghu. A *jinshi* of the Tianqi reign’s *yichou* year, he served as a vice-director before being sidelined for refusing to align with the Donglin faction. In his memorial, he wrote: *"I willingly stand alone, a petty man of stubborn integrity, and will never cling to the grass or lean on trees like those ambiguous gentlemen."* Thus, he incurred the Donglin faction’s enmity and was fiercely opposed. Dismissed from office, he returned home with a long whistle, embodying the spirit of the ancient *kuang* and *juān* recluses. Whenever he saw riverside households with small bridges and flowing streams, he would linger for ages, unable to tear himself away.

The recluse Wen Yinlin, styled Long, was a native of Yin County. With lofty aspirations, he dwelled in a humble thatched hut, savoring the rustic charm whenever wind rustled the bamboo or clouds chilled the pine roots. Some compared his poetry to riverside cottages—crooked tables, sparse windows—ever playing with the hues of water and clouds. I say his very nature was the same.

The recluse Chen Zhongchun, styled Meigong, was a native of Huating. While still in his prime, he abandoned fame to practice reclusion. He built a hut on the southern slope of Little Kun Mountain, ferried his books by boat, and styled himself the *"Nameless Angler."* On frosty nights when the moon cast its cold light and the iron flute’s notes rang clear, he felt Zhang Zhihe and Lu Tian sui were not far removed from his own time.

The recluse Yin Fangshu, styled Zhongchun, was a native of Xiushui. He tilled the fields in Nancun of Yongle, content in his solitude. He was the very man Chen Zhongchun described: *"Yet I envy old Yin the recluse, who plows alone amid the cooing of turtledoves."* His thatched walls and reed fences offered scant shelter from wind and rain. Admiring Wang Ji’s character, he also styled himself *"Master of Eastern Mound."* In his leisure from farming, he practiced medicine. With the money he earned, he would enter the market to buy tattered books and read them.

The recluse Zhu Baimin, styled Lu, was a native of Wu. Endowed with an extraordinary spirit, he once traveled alone to Mount Huang, journeying far to seek the peaks of Song and Hua. In the early Chongzhen reign, he rode a donkey to the capital, intending to present rhapsodies and eulogies, but left without success. He built a hut at the foot of Lotus Seed Peak on Mount Hua west of the prefecture, drawing water and grinding grain himself, unwilling to meet the powerful and wealthy. At times, he was grouped with Wang Jie’an and Zhao Fanfu as the *"Three Eminences of Wu,"* with Baimin foremost among them.

The scholar Li Yinzhong, styled Tianzhi, was a native of Pinghu. A *juren* of the Chongzhen reign’s *guiyou* year, he later changed his name to Que and styled himself Qianfu. He lived in seclusion on Dragon Abyss Mountain, beside Ten Thousand Pines Terrace, in a single thatched hut.

People praised him for his lofty retreat and distant withdrawal, his poetry resonant with the sound of limpid rivers and jade-green peaks.

**Xie Huixian**
The eminent scholar Xie Huixian, styled Lin, was a native of Yixing. A *juren* of the Chongzhen reign’s *guiyou* year, he concealed his traces at home, tending a single plot of vegetables, never entering the prefectural city. Chen Qinian’s poem in remembrance reads:
*"Half an acre of ox-palace encircles the vegetable field,
Hoeing rows and drawing water, alone in serene ease.
A pair of straw sandals worth a thousand gold—
Yet for ten years more, he treads not the city’s streets."*

**Lu Maoqu**
The lay scholar Lu Maoqu, styled Lian (also written as *Lian*), was a native of Wu County. Twice successful in the military examinations, after the *jiashen* year he shaved his head to become a monk, dwelling at the foot of Lotus Seed Peak. Amid wisteria’s graceful vines, he set his couch within the cliffside, ten thousand peaks facing his door, a single stream winding past his gate. He styled himself *"Liaoyuan Daoist"* and left behind *The Maple River Posthumous Manuscripts*.

**Li Zuoyan**
The eminent scholar Li Zuoyan, styled Yuankuan, was a native of Nanchang. Passing the Chongzhen *jinshi* examination, he served as Vice Commissioner of Education in Zhejiang, but was dismissed for offending Wen Tiren and returned home. There, he built a thatched hut on Deer Valley Isle.

With his disciples he discoursed on learning, maintaining a serene and unassuming demeanor. At the beginning of the Shunzhi reign, when recommended for office, he firmly declined on account of his aged mother and never emerged again in his lifetime.

**Fang Mizhi**
The eminent scholar Fang Mizhi, styled Yizhi, was a native of Tongcheng. Passing the Chongzhen *jinshi* examination, he served as Compiler, his reputation resounding throughout the realm. After the fall of the Ming, he shaved his head, changed his name to Hongzhi, styled himself *Wuke*, and took the sobriquet *"Yaodi Monk."* He wandered through famous mountains and never returned. His writings include *Illustrations of the Zhouyi*, *The Record of Snow-Boiling*, and *The Complete Works of Floating Mountain.*

**Liu Nianting**
The eminent scholar Liu Nianting, styled Boyuan, was a native of Cixi. Rising from the *jinshi* degree to the rank of Vice Surveillance Commissioner, he retired on grounds of illness and lived to over a hundred years. The Master had taken office in the fifth year of the Longqing reign, returned home in the sixteenth year of the Wanli reign, and by the eleventh year of the Chongzhen reign, he was already eighty. Amid perilous times and dynastic upheaval, the recluse endured, his resolve evident in his poem *"Self-Mockery at Eighty":*
*"They say I retired early—
Had I not, what good would have come?
How many longed to return but could not,
Their regrets deep as the yellow dog at the eastern gate."*
Those who heard it held him in high esteem. Later, he changed his name to *Tuokongzi* and vanished into the depths of the mountains, never to be seen again.

**Zhang Haodong**
The eminent scholar Zhang Haodong, styled Ruoxi, was a native of Huating. A *jinshi* of the Chongzhen *guiwei* year, after the *jiashen* year he concealed himself in the countryside, personally tending his garden.

Old friends who sought him out would find him hoeing the earth, straw hat upon his brow, exchanging bows amidst the purple gourds and white amaranth. His thatched cottage, a few rafters only, stood in quiet simplicity. At times, he called himself *"Master Cold Pine."*

**Wei Shuzi**
The reclusive scholar Wei Shuzi Xi, a native of Ningdu in Jiangxi, was a *xiucai* of the late Ming. With his younger brother Li, he built a hut on Mount Cuiwei in Jinhua, where they lived in seclusion together. Though high officials, hearing of his reputation, all wished to meet him, he never went. Li, styled Jizi, traveled widely among the famous mountains of the land, yet returned to dwell with Shuzi on Cuiwei, where a pair of cranes often came to keep them company.

**Liu Qiner**
The eminent scholar Liu Qiner Yongsui, a native of Wei County in Daming, was a *xiaolian* of the Chongzhen reign and appointed instructor of Changzhou. After the fall of the Ming, he concealed himself by Yangcheng Lake. When the provincial governor sought to recommend him for office, he firmly declined on grounds of illness. Though his family was poor and at times lacked even food and clothing, he remained composed. Often, he would take up the oars himself, rowing out to midstream to sing, returning only when the song was done. At dusk, he would linger alone beneath the mist-laden trees, watching the sun sink behind the mountains.

**Xia Yuanzhen**
The eminent scholar Xia Yuanzhen Dao, a native of Daming.

Liu Qiner had passed the *xiaolian* examination of the Chongzhen reign and immediately renounced all thought of official advancement. After the fall of the Ming, he led his wife and children into the mountains, tilling and weaving to sustain themselves. At times, he would take up the axe to craft spinning wheels for sale; people admired their sturdiness and refinement, all vying to purchase them. Clad in short robes, he would walk singing, his voice shaking the trees. Occasionally, he composed poetry and prose, but once the draft was complete, he would discard it. His sons were taught only to recognize characters and keep accounts; as they grew older, they herded cattle and carried firewood, their traces lost amid mist and clouds.

**Lin Mingjun**
The eminent scholar Lin Wei Mingjun, a native of Pingdu, was a man of ardent resolve who from youth excelled in poetry and ancient-style prose. When Sichuan fell in the Chongzhen reign’s *jiashen* year, Minister of War Wang Yingxiong received the imperial mandate to suppress the rebels. Lin was recommended as the foremost candidate and appointed Director in the Bureau of Operations of the Ministry of War. After the fall of the Ming, he refused to serve. During the Shunzhi era, he was nominated as Vice Prefect but declined on grounds of illness. Later, he was also nominated for the *Boxue Hongci* examination but did not attend. He built a hut beneath parasol trees, living in serene accord with the Dao, and remained in reclusion for over thirty years. Once, in Pingdu, he invited a spirit-writing séance; I happened to take up the planchette, and the spirit bestowed upon him the four characters *tie gan shi dan* ("iron liver and stone gall"). His extant works include *The Collected Writings of Danyuan Hall*, *The Poetry of Baziyuan*, and *Recent Works from Wutong Residence*.

**Huang Taichong** of the Qing dynasty.

The Recluse Master Huang Taichong Zongxi was a native of Yuyao. He studied under the Ming Confucian Liu Niantai, delving deeply into the teachings of former worthies, and thus his followers grew daily. In the eighteenth year of the Kangxi era, the Censor-in-Chief Xu Yuanwen specially recommended him to the court, but Taichong declined on grounds of illness. He purified his mind and sat in solemn stillness, striving to sweep away all external distractions. His writings spanned the ages, penetrating the myriad discourses, and he mastered all texts—from those on celestial offices and terrestrial records to the books of the Three Teachings and the Nine Schools. Scholars honored him as "Master Lizhou."

The Eminent Gentleman Qiu Zhi’ji
The Eminent Gentleman Qiu Zhi’ji, styled Zhaoaao and named Zhi’ji, was a native of Yin. In his youth, he studied the profound learning of human nature and destiny under Huang Zongxi. As a student of the Imperial Academy, he enjoyed great renown. Later, he served as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites but soon retired, citing illness. He engaged in deep inquiry into the secret principles of self-cultivation with Tao Cuncun of Kuaiji. Over time, his countenance became like pine and crane, radiating brilliance through the mountains and forests—truly one who had attained the vast and unshakable. His extant works include *Concise Explanations of the Four Books*, *Detailed Commentaries on Du Fu’s Poetry*, and *Insights into the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*.

The Recluse Tao Cuncun
The Recluse Tao Cuncun, styled Susi and originally named Shiyu, was a native of Kuaiji. In his youth, he traveled among the waters and mountains of Yue and the imperial palaces of Yan, and his literary brilliance flourished ever more. He passed the imperial examination in the Kangxi era but soon retired to reside in Shanyin.

He frequented the immortal realms of Huotong Grotto-Heaven, where he encountered transcendents from beyond the world who transmitted to him the secret methods of self-cultivation. Thereupon, he burned his examination essays. He composed *Five Daoist Sayings*, *Collected Commentaries*, and *Miscellaneous Principles of the Elixir School* to guide later disciples. Qiu Zhiji praised him, saying, "He roams carefree through forests and springs, delighting in Heaven and fulfilling his destiny." Truly discerning words. He styled himself "Layman of the Pure and Tranquil Heart" and also "Master of Penetrating the Subtle."

The Recluse Yan Qinming
The eminent scholar Yan Qinming, a native of Ronglu, passed the provincial examination in the Kangxi *bingwu* year. He delved deeply into the study of classics and history. When Wu Sangui occupied Shu, many scholar-officials were coerced into service, but Qinming alone upheld his integrity and refused to emerge. After Shu was pacified, he built a dwelling at the foot of Yuchan Mountain and spent his life without ever setting foot in the cities.

The Recluse Shen Yuexi
The reclusive scholar Shen Yuexi, styled Juru, was a native of Wan County. Embracing lofty ideals, he retreated into the mountains, styling himself "Wild Man of West Stream." Li Peizhi, the governor-general of Sichuan, knowing of his long-standing scholarship, urged him to enter officialdom, but he declined. He constructed a hall of several bays, declaring, "I find joy in cold amusement; all who gaze upon my countenance regard me as Chao Fu or Xu You."

The Eminent Scholar Cheng Wuqiao
The eminent scholar Cheng Wuqiao, styled Mengxing, was a native of Jiangdu. He passed the metropolitan examination in the Kangxi era and was appointed Compiler. After returning home due to mourning, he never reemerged, for he was one indifferent to profit.

He built the Bamboo Grove Garden and the Southern Ripple Villa, where he composed verses and reclined in leisure. Whenever jade-green bamboo swayed in the emerald rain or clouds drifted over the lake’s shade, he would brew tea and share cakes with secluded scholars and refined guests, composing poems inspired by the scene. Those who beheld him saw nothing less than the image of a solitary cloud or a wild crane.

The Eminent Scholar Zhang Huanhua
The eminent scholar Zhang Yishan, styled Liang, was a native of Lou County. Having passed the metropolitan examination in the Kangxi era, he promptly retired to seclusion at West Stream. There he constructed the Pavilion of Preserved Leisure, featuring ten scenic vistas replete with the finest waters, bamboos, flowers, and herbs. Yishan was skilled at playing the zither; whenever he encountered secluded landscapes or moments of perfect wind and moonlight, he would settle the strings and strike up a melody, causing even the chariots of immortals to pause in midair. Though his sons and nephews all attained high office, and some urged him to emerge from reclusion—assuring him that prestigious posts could be swiftly secured—he would only smile without reply. Having attained enlightenment as if passing an examination with an empty mind, he devoted himself wholly to Chan cultivation, styling himself "Daoist of Illusory Blossoms."

The Recluse Jin Shoumen
The reclusive scholar Jin Shoumen, styled Nong, was a commoner of Qiantang. His nature was aloof and unyielding, untouched by the trends of the age. In his later years, he pursued only the joy of others being busy while he remained at leisure.

In the final days of the twelfth lunar month, he would bring out his family’s home-brewed wine, inviting the village elders to gather, laughing and discoursing on the recluses and true gentlemen of past and present—truly a lofty scholar. In middle age, he embarked on a carefree journey, traveling extensively through Qi, Lu, Yan, Zhao, Qin, Jin, Chu, and Min before returning home. He once wished to roam a thousand *li* a day like the ragged Daoist, and again to strike the bell and sweep the ground like the attendant of Clear Cool Mountain. During the Qianlong era, he sojourned in Yangzhou, concealing himself amid painting and calligraphy.

The Recluse Li Keshan
The reclusive scholar Li Keshan, styled Guo, was a commoner of Changzhou. He savored the Dao in his reading, secluding himself on South Ridge, reciting scriptures through hunger, his gate marked by two wooden boards. At times, when firewood ran short, he remained untroubled. He once remarked, *"Wealth and rank may bring joy, but they are not so fine as the immortals; the bustle of court and market may be lived in, but they are not so fine as the forests and springs."* During the Qianlong era, Governor Ya sought him out upon hearing his name, but he avoided the meeting—truly a lofty scholar of Wu.

The Accomplished Zhao Oubai
The accomplished scholar Zhao Oubai, also known as Oubei, styled Yun Song, was a native of Yanghu. In the twenty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign, he placed third in the imperial examination. He served as an official in Guixi.

Having petitioned to care for his aged mother, he never again took office. With Oubai’s early retirement, his travels grew leisurely. He once wandered the peaks of Tiantai, Yandang, and Wuyi, his spirit soaring as if roaming with immortals. Passing Mount Fuquan in Guizhou, he lingered in the Ritual Northern Dipper Pavilion and copied the *Song of Sitting in Meditation* before departing. In his later years, after meals he practiced the *Free and Easy Wandering* method, thus attaining great longevity, presiding over forests and ponds for several decades.

**Yin Guoyuan**
The reclusive scholar Yin Guoyuan, styled Rumei, was a native of Yuanhe. Content in poverty and devoted to the Dao, his secluded integrity remained steadfast. When visitors sought him out, they found a winding stream beside his gate, marked by two wooden boards, nestled among sparse willows by a crooked bridge—his bamboo basket and gourd dipper often empty, yet he remained unperturbed. He once inscribed a couplet: *"Lying in the woods, one truly forgets the years; with a tranquil heart, one need not shame the immortals."* In my spiritual wanderings, I encountered this and judged him a true recluse.

**Wu Zhuqiao**
The accomplished scholar Wu Zhuqiao, styled Weiguang, was a native of Zhaowen. Having passed the imperial examination in the Qianlong era, he served as a secretary in the Ministry of Rites, then transferred to the Ministry of Ceremonies upon entering the Hanlin Academy. Yearning for misty mountains, he resigned from his lucrative post, his aspiration for a life among birds and clouds as deep as the purity of the Jishui and Ying rivers. Roaming the hills in carefree song, he delved into history and literature, collecting rare steles. His uninhibited ways with zither and wine were admired by all, yet I alone esteemed his lofty reclusion.

**Luo Yufeng**
The reclusive scholar Luo Yufeng, styled Pin, was a commoner of She County who later settled in Yangzhou. He once studied under Shoumen, his brushwork imbued with extraordinary spirit, particularly fond of painting ghosts and spirits. Whatever he encountered, he recorded in long scrolls, compiling the *Ghost Amusements*. In my spiritual wanderings through Yufeng’s studio, the ghosts all rose to bow—truly a marvel. Beyond painting, he excelled in poetry, delighted in mountain travels, and favored Chan Buddhism. He composed the *Record of Awakening Faith*, resolving the doubts of both Chan and Pure Land schools.

**Weng Dansheng**
The reclusive scholar Weng Dansheng, styled Chun, was a commoner of Huating. His nature was pure and untrammeled, his poetic style serene and leisurely—even Xu Yonghui and Luo Zhaojian could not surpass him. His friend prefaced his collected works, writing: *"He delighted in tranquility, embraced solitude, served his mother with beans and water, farmed, studied, and taught his younger brother. Unmarried at forty, he never sat for official examinations. His poetry was like the sparse strings of a zither, one chant evoking three sighs."* These eight lines capture Dansheng entirely.

Weng inscribed a poem on the wall while traveling in Yangzhou, with the lines:
*"Two parts of moonlight, shadowing the passes and mountains in dreams,
One surge of waves, voicing ancient and modern sorrows."*

I, Hua Lao Dao, happened to be wandering leisurely at the time and found the words *"dreams"* and *"sorrows"* unsuitable for a reclusive scholar. I altered *"dreams"* to *"shared"* and *"sorrows"* to *"flow,"* drawing from the meaning of *"Together we share this single moon, as the blue river flows without end."* When Weng passed by again and saw the changes, he bowed deeply in reverence, saying: *"Only

What is the Dao? It encompasses the generation of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and all things, bearing the mechanism of yin-yang and movement-stillness, possessing the profound principles of creation and transformation. It unites the Wuji and gives rise to the Taiji.

The Wuji is the Unnamed—what is unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The Taiji is the Named—what is named is the mother of the myriad things.
From the Unnamed comes the Named, and thus Heaven is born, Earth is born, humanity is born, and all things are born.

Now, speaking specifically of human birth:
Before father and mother conceived, there was but a vast emptiness, serene and boundless—this was the time of Wuji.
The Wuji is yin stillness; when yin is still, yang is also still.
At the moment of conception by father and mother, a wisp of numinous qi entered the womb—this was the time of Taiji.
The Taiji is yang movement; when yang moves, yin also moves.
From this, yin and yang interact, hardness and softness grind, the Eight Trigrams surge, and thus the Qian Dao forms the male, the Kun Dao forms the female.

At the outset of male-female union, the man’s essence and the woman’s blood blend into one—this is the root of the human body.
Thereafter, the father’s essence is stored in the kidneys, the mother’s blood in the heart; heart and kidneys are linked by meridians, following the mother’s breath. After ten months, the form is complete, and the child emerges from the mother’s womb.
At this moment, the nature is submerged in unawareness, with the Wuji concealing its spirit; the life-force depends on existence, with the Taiji nurturing its qi.
When the qi and meridians are still and the primordial spirit is inwardly stored, this is called true nature.
When the spirit’s thoughts are still and the primordial qi grows within, this is called true destiny.
In this undifferentiated, childlike state, what is present is precisely the Heavenly Nature and Heavenly Destiny.
If one can follow this Heavenly Nature to restore one’s Heavenly Destiny, this is what may be called the Dao—how then could the cultivation of the Dao fail to attain the Dao?

Alas, as consciousness sharpens and awareness deepens, blood and qi nourish growth, and the years pass. The Seven Emotions and Six Desires arise in endless profusion, ceaseless day and night.
The heart, long stirred, wearies the spirit; essence, much depleted, exhausts the qi. Birth and aging press close, and the afflictions of sickness and death take shape. Without replenishment, consumptive illnesses arise frequently, and to long preserve the body becomes difficult.

Observing this path of life and death, people regard it as ordinary—truly a pity! Yet when illness befalls the body, they seek physicians to regulate and heal, hoping to rise from deep affliction and prolong their years. At such times, though the will to live exists, of what use is it?

Witnessing the common aversion to death, I sought the wondrous art of longevity. After years of toil, I came to know the Immortal Dao.
The Immortal Dao is the Dao of long life, yet世人 often dismiss it as heterodoxy.
Yet what the Yellow Emperor and Laozi transmitted is none other than the principle of rectifying the heart, cultivating the body, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world—why then marvel at it as heterodoxy?

If one can cultivate the uprightness of body and heart, true essence and true spirit will gather within, and great talent and great virtue will emerge from within.
The *Classic* says: *"Only when at peace can one deliberate."* How profound the words!
I have long pondered this.

Just as Zhang Liang of Xiapei found tranquility before aiding the Han to avenge Han, and Zhuge Liang rested in Nanyang before assisting Shu to campaign against Wei; as Li Guang of the Tang nourished himself on Mount Heng before reviving the Tang and vanquishing the barbarians—so too did Ge Zhichuan govern Gou Lou, Zhao Qingyuan administer Jia Zhou, and Master Xu of Jingyang preside over his domain: all these attained the Dao and abided in the world, serving in office to bring peace to the people. Could their hearts not have been filled with the benevolence and righteousness of sovereign and father?

Confucius despised reclusion and the bizarre; Mencius rejected Yang Zhu and Mo Di. Yet reclusion here refers to the apocryphal prophecies and works like the *Feng Shan Shu*, while the bizarre denotes figures like Weisheng Gao and Chen Zhongzi. The Immortals’ way is not thus. When Master Changchun was summoned to court, his audience embodied the ancient virtue of cherishing the people and loving all things; when Master Xiyi retired to the mountains, he carried the integrity of lofty purity—where in this lies reclusion or the bizarre?

Yang Zhu’s self-centeredness and Mo Di’s disregard for kin are foreign to the Immortals’ way. Among the three thousand meritorious deeds, aiding others and benefiting the world take precedence; among the twenty-four exemplars of filial piety, Wu Meng and Ding Lan were both Immortal guests—how could they be equated with Yang and Mo?

Confucius spoke of "seeking the will," Mencius of "esteeming the will." What will is this? It is nothing other than *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness). *Ren* pertains to Wood, which conceals Fire within—its great function is to nurture and illuminate, hence *ren*. *Yi* pertains to Metal, which generates Water—its great function is to regulate and circulate, hence *yi*. The Immortals’ mercury and lead are the seeds of *ren* and *yi*. When Metal and Wood intermingle, Water and Fire nurture one another, then through reclusion one seeks the will, esteems the will, and thereafter mercury and lead arise, the elixir congeals. The will encompasses *ren* and *yi*, mercury and lead, and unites the Four Symbols of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire. To seek and esteem this is to act with sincerity; when sincerity and Earth unite, the Five Phases are complete. The great Dao’s affairs are thus fulfilled.

In their time, Confucius and Mencius only refuted reclusion, the bizarre, Yang, and Mo, yet never heard of them rejecting Buddhism or Daoism. From the Tang and Song dynasties onward, however, the two worthies Han [Yu] and Zhu [Xi] vigorously attacked the two teachings, and many great Confucians echoed them. Lesser scholars, picking up their scraps, sought to attach themselves to their tails—yet where, in the end, did they strike? Instead, they only drew smiles from the World-Honored One and sighs from the Most High.

These lesser scholars merely blew idle flutes, lacking the insight of Han and Zhu. Why say so? When Han and Zhu attacked the two teachings, they targeted those who were neither true Buddhists nor true Daoists—not those who genuinely studied Buddhism or Daoism. Otherwise, why would the *Collected Poems of Han Changli* contain so many exchanges with followers of the two teachings? There are poems sending off Daoist Master Zhang, poems sending off the Great Master Dian, and poems for Masters Hui and Ling. Some claim he used others to voice his critiques, as when he wrote of Master Hui: *"I detest the idle and indolent, / Pitying your foolishness and simplicity,"* or of Master Ling: *"I would gather the Way, / And crown your head with it,"* seeming to mock them. Yet why does he offer no disparaging words for Daoist Master Zhang, nor any dismissive remarks for Master Dian? For these two masters were true disciples of Immortals and Buddhas. Master Zhang, an unappointed minister, returned to the Real; Master Dian, with his wisdom and prajna, mastered Chan. Even Han Changli could not bring himself to attack or slander them.

Moreover, his family later produced Han Xiang, the Immortal Uncle, whose snowbound encounter at Blue Pass revealed his awareness that the distant traveler was no ordinary man. In his youth, Master Zhu [Xi] also dallied with the two teachings, but failing to find the gate, he was misled by false adherents. Thus he suspected their teachings of emptiness, absurdity, and desolation, turning back to oppose them. Yet in his later years, his learning deepened, and he grew fond of reading the *Cantong Qi*, even stating: *"The *Cantong Qi* was not written to elucidate the *Book of Changes*; it merely borrows this to convey the timing of advancing and retreating in practice."* In another letter, he wrote: *"Recently, on the road, I carried no other books, and at last grew familiar with the *Cantong Qi*,"* showing his newfound relish for the Immortals’ way. Thus, Han and Zhu only attacked those who were neither true Buddhists nor true Daoists—not those who genuinely studied Buddhism or Daoism. Otherwise, their own words would contradict themselves, rendering the two worthies laughable.

Though untalented, I have perused the hundred schools and synthesized the principles of the Three Teachings, recognizing that all three share this one Dao. Confucianism apart from this Dao is no Confucianism; Buddhism apart from this Dao is no Buddhism; Daoism apart from this Dao is no Daoism. Yet Daoism is uniquely called the Gate of the Dao, taking the Dao as its charge—what more need be said?

In fair assessment: *"Confucianism is for acting to benefit the times; Buddhism is for awakening to the Dao and enlightening the world; Daoism is for concealing the Dao and delivering people."* Each expounds its own wonders; together, they harmonize beautifully. Why engage in verbal disputes?

The Dao is nothing other than exhausting principle, fulfilling one’s nature, and arriving at destiny. Confucius rarely spoke of it; the Immortals expound it freely, illustrating it with metaphors. Though their terminology is abundant, the Dao’s meaning is subtle, so people fail to grasp it. Humans are nurtured by Heaven and Earth and born of father and mother. Following the natural course, descendants continue the ancestral line; reversing it, true Immortals and supreme sages emerge in succession—the principle is the same.

The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *"The practice of cultivating the body is not limited by gender. This great elixir of golden cinnabar, though grasped by the foolish and rustic, instantly elevates one to Immortal rank."*

Regardless of noble or base, wise or foolish, old and frail or young and strong—so long as one accumulates hidden virtue, practices benevolence and compassion, and fulfills loyalty, filial piety, trustworthiness, and sincerity in the human Dao, the Dao of Immortality is naturally not far away. One must also thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply fathom the workings of creation, discern truth from falsehood, obtain the correct qi of yin and yang, and seek the true origin of lead and mercury. Only then can one transform the bones and attain longevity, dwell in the celestial realm of unending light, enjoy the scenery of eternal spring, and endure as long as Heaven and Earth, shining as brightly as the sun and moon—this is truly the proper affair of a great man.

As for heterodox paths and deviant practices—such as controlling women to absorb yin essence, refining the Three Yellows, or ingesting the Eight Minerals—these are all fruitless side doors. Some advocate massage and daoyin exercises, exhalation and inhalation techniques, or the cultivation and consumption of medicinal herbs as methods of nurturing life. Though these may temporarily dispel illness, they cannot escape the inevitable decline of old age and the exhaustion of destiny, and will only be ridiculed by the enlightened. Master Boduan said: *"The method of breath retention, if one can forget all scheming and extinguish all thoughts, may also lead to samadhi and spirit departure."* Yet essence, qi, and spirit belong to yin, and their dwelling is difficult to secure, often subject to the suffering of displacement. There are also techniques claiming to replenish qi and blood through inhalation, known as methods of "drawing and adding to extend life." These may help avoid illness and prolong years, preserving health and vigor, but if one seeks to ingest and nurture the embryonic Immortal, they will surely fail. All other heterodox paths and deviant practices are truly heresies within our Dao—what are they worth?

Some argue that human life and death are all predetermined by fate, and that none can defy destiny to escape death. Yet they fail to consider that fortune is sought by the self, destiny is forged by the self, and hidden merit can extend one’s years. Those who study longevity need only take hidden virtue as the foundation and the Golden Elixir as the application—thus even destiny may be escaped.

I reverently recall our Most High Dao Ancestor and the successive Perfected Saints, who, moved by a heart of loving-kindness and a vow to broadly deliver all beings, expansively inaugurated the Mysterious Teachings and secretly transmitted the Immortal formula known as the Golden Elixir. From beginning to end, they thereby fully revealed the celestial mechanisms and greatly disclosed the primordial mysteries. Within it, the wondrous practices of conduct—three periods and three barriers, nine zithers and nine swords, medicinal materials and ritual implements, fire phases and talismanic charts—have all been elaborated in full. Each should diligently study the various scriptures to return to the root of one’s nature and destiny.

Though my discourse is common, its principles are most refined—what is said is true and not false. If one obtains this without doubt or suspicion, one may proceed with practice and begin cultivation. Even without encountering an enlightened teacher or good friend, upon obtaining this text, it is as if the teacher or friend stands before you, enabling sudden awakening to the supreme Dao. Compared to other circulating elixir scriptures, all align with the same principle, leaving nothing obscure.

Truly, this is the compassionate vessel across the sea of suffering and the luminous torch guiding the lost. Though the path may be arduous, one must not fear difficulty and settle for ease. Furthermore, after embracing the Golden Elixir, one should retreat to secluded grotto-heavens and conceal oneself in blessed lands. Do not flaunt alchemical gold and silver before the court, becoming a forerunner for false adepts. Conceal or reveal yourself to deliver beings, awaiting the celestial decree to ascend in broad daylight. Only by not displaying one’s talents can one become a supreme Perfected of the highest rank—one who endures through ten thousand kalpas without decay.

Later fellow practitioners, ponder and take heed.

This grand and expansive work first explores the source of the Great Dao, then expounds the principles of human life and the causes of birth, aging, sickness, and death, guiding others to turn their heads toward the Dao, rectify their conduct, and govern with peace—just as the heroic immortals of antiquity, who cultivated both fame and the body, achieving loyalty and filial piety, unlike the heretical teachings of Yang Zhu, Mo Di, or the recluses and eccentrics. It makes clear that this Dao is also the Confucian Dao, where nurturing mercury and cultivating lead differ not from dwelling in benevolence and following righteousness.

Han Yu and Zhu Xi refuted the two schools (Buddhism and Daoism), but they only rejected the false disciples of those traditions; here, a more comprehensive discussion is offered. It sweeps aside heterodox paths and deviant byways, returning wholly to the Dao of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining destiny—a resounding call that awakens the deaf and a monumental text that orders heaven and earth.

**Middle Section**
Between heaven and earth, the most numinous and noble is humanity; the most fleeting and swift is time; and that which can be vast and enduring is the Golden Elixir. Yet most people drown in the pursuit of fame, wealth, and power, or entangle themselves in love, desire, and worldly attachments, endlessly greedy like wolves or ceaselessly drawn like moths to flame. When the great limit arrives, how can regret avail them then? They resign themselves to awaiting death, knowing nothing of the method for longevity and agelessness, nor the wondrous efficacy of the Golden Elixir’s divine medicine. How lamentable!

This Golden Elixir’s divine medicine is not something absent from the world, nor is it unattainable in the heavens. It is sought only among its kind—an innate substance of the living body. Simple and easy, near rather than distant. I once composed a *Rhapsody on the Golden Elixir* to record it, its verses luminous and resonant. Now recalling its lines:

*"To forge the Golden Elixir,
First borrow heaven and earth as the Mysterious Female,
Learn the transformations of yin and yang.
Recognize the correspondence of the two eights,
Know the mutual concealment of Kan and Li.
Await the fullness of the metal qi,
Listen to the vastness of the tidal waters.
Then observe the lead blossoms after Gui,
Admire the moonlit evening in the Geng direction.
Wield the knife and spatula in an instant,
Cease the battlefield of dragon and tiger.
Summon the Metal Lord to return home,
Pair the Jade Maiden in the chamber."*

If one truly masters this Dao, even the foolish will become wise, and the weak will grow strong. As the former Confucians said: *"The sage does not speak of ease, lest it confuse people; nor does he speak of difficulty, lest it deter their progress."* If one pursues it with intent and cultivates diligently, one will surely enter sagehood, transcend the mundane, ascend to the realm of longevity, and eternally enjoy boundless joy—how could this be a small benefit?

Moreover, in the pursuit of fame, wealth, and power, some endure extreme hardship before success. If one redirects the heart that labors for such things toward cultivation, one will soon hold the Ninefold Return in hand, preserve the spirit through ten thousand kalpas, and compare this to fame and wealth—how short the one, how long the other!

Confucius said: *"Wealth and honor gained through unrighteousness are to me like floating clouds."* He also said: *"To practice benevolence is to prevent the unbenevolent from affecting one’s person."* Nothing is more unbenevolent or unrighteous than reckless greed and delusion. Master Hu said: *"One who is devoted to the Dao is not burdened by external things."* *Awakening to Reality* states: *"If one understands the mechanism of killing and its reversals, one knows that harm gives rise to grace."* Thus, to seek the Returned Elixir, one must first sever desire. To sever desire, one must diligently wield the mechanism of killing—keeping the spiritual sword ever at hand. When external desires arise, swiftly invoke the killing mechanism, never indulging the mind. With long practice, one becomes indifferent to circumstances and can proceed on the path of returning to the root and reverting to the origin.

The *Wings of the Book of Changes* says: *"All day long, acting with vigor—this is the Dao of reversal."* The Dao of reversal is the fruition of attaining longevity. Why do people not strive to practice it? Even the myriad things, like the grasses and trees, can return to the root and revert to the origin, enduring through the seasons. Humans, the most numinous of the myriad things, move toward death—are they not then inferior to grasses and trees? Can one not feel shame?

This path of returning to the root and reverting to the origin is no heterodox byway or deviant path. The world values virtue and conduct first, with hidden merit as the foundation. One examines the mechanisms of yin-yang transformation, seeks the wonders of the Mysterious Female and heaven-earth, distinguishes the substances of the two eights and Kan-Li, determines the timing of golden blossoms and water-moon, and deploys the power of subduing the dragon and taming the tiger. By clarifying the place where life and destiny are established, and through emptying the self and guarding stillness—where the other is host and the self is guest—with the radiance of sun and moon intersecting and the earthly branches Wu and Ji in use, the Elixir is completed as easily as turning the palm.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"When male and female unite their essence, the myriad things are transformed and born."* Humans receive this body from their parents—without them, how could one exist? Thus, the method of making the Golden Elixir is the same as the process of birth, except that following the natural course produces a human, while reversing it produces an immortal. Between following and reversing, heaven and earth stand far apart. One need only reverse the use of yin and yang, and success comes naturally—this is no heterodox byway or deviant path.

What I have discussed here boldly reveals the true mechanism, all drawn from the oral transmissions and heart-to-heart instructions of the successive sages. If one acts accordingly, one can seize the mysterious power of heaven and earth, plumb the unfathomable depths of ghosts and spirits—this is truly the oral formula of the Golden Elixir. Beyond this, there is no other transmission.

The former worthies said: *"Before the sages were born, the Dao resided in heaven and earth; after the sages passed, the Dao was recorded in the Six Classics."* Though my humble discourse does not dare compare to the sacred scriptures, it may serve as the proper path for seeking the Dao—like parting the clouds and mist to see the blue sky, or cutting through the brambles to find the great road. It is open and unobstructed, suddenly revealing a gateway. If scholars devote themselves to its study, they will naturally and silently align with the karmic conditions of immortality. Do not regard it lightly.

It is worth more than ten thousand gold, rarer than a hundred treasures. Do not show it to the unworthy—cherish it well.

*The Awakening to Reality* states: *"To learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality—only the Golden Elixir is most certain."* This text focuses on the external medicine of the Golden Elixir, while the internal medicine of the Golden Liquid is also encompassed within it. Repeatedly and earnestly, it urges people to awaken in time, refine the self, and seek the Lead. Its compassion for the world is as if inscribed on the spirit tablet—an old admonition, yet every line is a secret oral instruction. Those with aspiration may further seek the oral instruction within the oral instruction, and the Returned Elixir will not be difficult to attain.

**The Following Section**

That which is called "one yin, one yang" is the Dao. Those who cultivate the Dao cultivate this Dao of yin and yang. One yin and one yang are nothing other than one nature and one life. *The Doctrine of the Mean* says: *"To cultivate the Dao is called teaching."* The sages of the Three Teachings all based their teachings on this Dao. This Dao originates in nature and is rooted in life.

Life is like a decree: heaven bestows upon humans its mandate as a command. Nature is principle: humans follow heaven’s principle through their nature. If one wishes to follow this principle, then externally fulfilling ethical norms is its principle, and internally practicing vigilant solitude is its principle. Loyalty, filial piety, friendliness, and reverence reside within, yet their radiance shines outwardly. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight manifest externally, yet when guarded before they arise, they remain within. The sky is bright and clear, the earth is lively and free—fulfilling one’s nature, the internal elixir is accomplished.

To fully preserve one’s mandate, the diligent care given to it is this mandate, and the method of employing it is this mandate. Cultivating the mind and nurturing nature is the diligent labor of preserving life. Accumulating righteousness to generate qi is the method of employing the mandate. Refining qi to transform spirit, refining spirit to return to heaven—restoring one’s nature and simultaneously restoring one’s life, the external elixir is achieved.

I wish for those who come after to cultivate this true Dao, and so I speak plainly. In cultivating the Dao, cultivating the body is paramount, yet to cultivate the body, one must first rectify the mind and make the intent sincere. When intent is sincere and the mind is rectified, all worldly desires are eliminated. Only then can one discuss establishing the foundation: qi as the agent, spirit as the master.

At the outset of practice, scholars must recognize the moment when the first yang stirs and the time when true Lead begins to emerge. Its qi is swift as lightning, unable to long abide in the prenatal state. In an instant, it generates Water of Gui; in a moment, it transforms into flowing channels. By the time it takes form and materializes, it already belongs to the postnatal and is no longer usable.

Above Kunlun, there is a mysterious gate, its aperture exceedingly small. When yin and yang unite, no movement is permitted. One must wait for their emotions and nature to resonate, and naturally, self and other will communicate. All that has form cannot ascend into the aperture—only the true qi, like a bellows, can enter within. Thus, the sage directly points to the prenatal qi, surging to open this aperture.

It is also said: *"The path of cultivation can extend life and prolong years, refining the true to preserve the whole. It is without coming or going, without birth or extinction."* Yet today’s foolish people, upon hearing of the method that employs the yang of life, instead practice the deceptive arts of bedroom techniques. This is like wearing hemp to fight fire or a moth flying into a flame—coveting beauty, they indulge recklessly. By day, they exert themselves and labor excessively; by night, they indulge in passion and lust, causing their spirit to dull and qi to scatter, their marrow to deplete and essence to wither. Still, they do not awaken, willingly awaiting their end.

The worthies of old were not like this. They fulfilled both loyalty and filial piety, broadly practiced benevolence and righteousness, secretly performed kind deeds, and silently accumulated hidden merits. They regarded life and death as their sole concern, never allowing fame or profit to occupy their minds. By day, they minimized thoughts and worries; by night, they purified their minds and reduced desires. Thus, their spirit remained whole, their qi robust, their marrow full, and their essence abundant.

They often lamented the mortal body as fire within stone or bubbles upon water. Those who have not heard the Dao should urgently seek a teacher; those who have heard it should urgently seek the medicine. They should broadly study and widely adopt, faithfully receive and practice, seeking the great medicine of the prenatal and searching for the elixir formula of transcendence. They should hasten to begin practice, ever fearful that time waits for no one.

The Dao is not some minor technique of side doors—it is the wondrous Dao of the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir, transmitted orally and received in the heart. It is not the method of the Two Vehicles of fixed breathing, but the supreme Dao of the One Vehicle. Through effort, one enters effortlessness; through external medicine, one refines internal medicine. With the self, one seeks the other; with yin, one matches yang; with Lead, one joins Mercury; with qi, one unites spirit.

Effortlessness is not the method of guarding against danger or holding the city, nor the practice of warm nurturing or icy bathing. It is the work of shedding the embryo and transforming the spirit after obtaining the elixir. Effort is not the techniques of sexual arts or the methods of ninefold movement. It is the Dao of tranquil emptiness, guarding the feminine without aggression, still and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated. This is the task of refining the self and establishing the foundation before obtaining the elixir.

Effort and effortlessness mark the beginning and end of substance and function, as has been shown here. Internal medicine and external medicine are the methods of origin and manifestation, further detailed elsewhere.

External medicine is born within the womb of creation; internal medicine is produced within one’s own body. Internal medicine is essence; external medicine is qi. Internal medicine nurtures nature; external medicine establishes life. Only when nature and life are cultivated together does one accord with the Dao of immortality.

Great cultivators who seek the prenatal external medicine must refine the self to await the arising of yang. They use spirit and qi to forge the sword of wisdom, gathering the Water of Metal and harmonizing softness and hardness. The ancients, in gathering medicine and advancing fire, relied entirely on this.

Eliminate the afflictions of the seven emotions and dispel the harms of the five thieves. Without refining the self to remove the harms of thieves, one cannot constantly respond and remain still. How can the hun and po be controlled? How can emotions and desires not interfere?

If one wishes to enter the chamber and apply the work, to approach the furnace and begin practice, then although the external fire moves, the internal tally does not respond.

Only because hardness and softness remain unbalanced, the sword of wisdom lacks its edge, and demonic forces wreak havoc, disturbing the heart and spirit, giving rise to scattered desires. Thus, one drifts with circumstances, causing mercury and fire to scatter, and the sacred embryo fails to form.

If self-refinement is mastered, the heart harbors no stray thoughts, the body becomes like the Great Void—unstained by a single speck of dust, all concerns dissolved. When the heart dies, the spirit lives; when the body is empty, qi circulates. Only then may one seek the Dao of the first yang and the work of the two celestial periods.

Returning the elixir is easy; refining the self is most difficult! Rely on the sword of wisdom to cleave open the primordial chaos, wield the craftsman’s hand to chisel through the undifferentiated. Then employ the method of inverting yin and yang, the Dao of harmonizing water and fire, so that earth and heaven unite in harmony. Let yang dwell below, and fire will naturally rise; let yin rest above, and water will naturally descend. Only through enduring hardship and practicing forbearance, keeping body and mind unmoved—when one’s nature abides, the other’s qi will return of itself.

If one can do this, one attains the effect of guarding the feminine without striving, remaining still and serene, responsive yet unobstructed. At the moment before the Supreme Ultimate divides, stillness reaches its extreme yet has not yet given way to movement. Yang first revives but has not yet parted from yin. Await the descent of this true prenatal qi, then use the method to gather and guide it into the Yellow Court. Daily, refine one’s mercury, enclosing it securely. As mercury qi gradually accumulates and lead qi gradually disperses, the elixir coalesces within the crucible.

One must then regulate the true breath, circulating it through the six voids, until sound fades and intent unites—only then do qi harmonize and pulses settle, and the elixir begins to congeal. Wait until the sacred embryo’s qi is full, the ten-month work complete, the embryo transformed and the infant born. Nurture it with skill, so that its comings and goings are unobstructed, and it remains unswayed by demonic temptations. Only after the ninefold transmutation is perfected and the time of wall-facing arrives—refining essence into qi, refining spirit into emptiness—do form and spirit become wondrously one, merging with the true Dao. This is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.

This Dao was not transmitted by the ancients to the world, for fools lack steadfast belief and diligent practice, and instead slander it. Thus, it was kept secret. Since encountering the perfected one, I have set forth these essentials of self-cultivation to awaken later learners. Let those of like mind exert themselves together and ascend the immortal’s capital.

This text exhausts the truth of nature and life, revealing the principles of sages, immortals, and buddhas—rooted in origins, clear as commentary. It distinguishes the sequence of action and non-action, the division of internal and external medicine, the subtleties of nurturing and delivering the embryo, all laid out in these pages. Nothing more need be added.

The profound mechanism is directly expounded here, as the patriarch revised earlier works to instruct others. Thus, it is appended to the complete collection as two essays on the firing times of elixir refinement.

In beginning the work, one must not cling to action, for action belongs to the postnatal. Many in today’s Daoist circles fall into this error, hence few in the world attain authenticity. Nor should one fixate on non-action, for non-action leads to stagnant emptiness. Many in today’s Buddhist circles succumb to this flaw, hence few in the world become true disciples of the Buddha. The failure of this Dao to spread lies in its obscurity.

The initial work lies in extinguishing emotional attachments and sweeping away stray thoughts. Removing stray thoughts is the first step in laying the foundation and refining the self. Once the human heart is cleared, the celestial heart returns; once human desires are purified, celestial principle abides. Each day, first still the mind for a time, until body and mind are settled, breath and qi harmonized. Then gently close the eyes, lower the gaze, and inwardly observe the space one inch and three fen between the heart below and the kidneys above. Only by finding the place where qi stirs can one avoid falling into emptiness or clinging to stagnation—neither grasping nor abandoning, neither forgetting nor forcing. All thoughts vanish, and only the solitary spirit remains: this is called right mindfulness.

At this time, within this mindfulness, be lively and free; within that qi, be leisurely and unhurried. Exhale to the upper, but not so far as to disturb the heart; inhale to the lower, but not so far as to disturb the kidneys. With each opening and closing, each coming and going, practice for one or two weeks, and naturally the two kidneys will steam with fire, the qi of the cinnabar field will warm. Breath need not be regulated, for it regulates itself; qi need not be refined, for it refines itself. Once qi and breath harmonize, they naturally neither exit nor enter, neither come nor go in the upper, middle, or lower—this is called embryonic breathing, spiritual breathing, the true bellows and furnace, the return to the root and revival of life, the mysterious female’s gate, the root of heaven and earth.

At this stage, qi is like a flower just budding, like an embryo just forming. Naturally, true qi steams and nourishes the constructive and protective energies, ascending from the coccyx, piercing the spine, rising to the mud-pill palace. Descending the magpie bridge, passing the multi-storied tower, it reaches the Crimson Palace and settles in the middle cinnabar field—this is the initial stirring of the river chariot. But though qi arrives, spirit is not yet complete; this is not the true stirring, so do not attend to it. Simply maintain gentle inward focus, guarding the central palace, and boundless vitality will arise. This is what is meant by nurturing the bud.

After one or two months of practice, the spirit becomes ever more still. With prolonged stillness, qi increasingly generates—this is the work of spirit generating qi and qi generating spirit. After a hundred days or more, vitality flourishes, true qi gradually fills, and with the gentlest firing, blood and water become abundant. Naturally, kan and li unite in marriage, qian and kun converge, spirit merges with qi, and in an instant, true qi blends as one. Suddenly, a whirlwind rises, surging through the hundred channels—this is the true stirring of the river chariot. If a single point of numinous light is felt in the cinnabar field, it is the mysterious pearl beneath the water, the yellow sprout within the earth.

At this time, the first yang revives, like the red sun rising over the vast sea.

Like mist, like smoke—now hidden, now visible—then lead-fire is born. When qian and kun, kan and li have yet to unite, in utter emptiness and quiescence, spirit congeals within. With unbroken effort, all is forged into one mass—this is the harmonizing of the Five Phases.

When water and fire merge, the second stage of gathering begins; the river chariot reverses its course, and in the fourth stage, the medicine is obtained. Spirit dwells within, the radiance of the elixir never departs—this is called the Great Celestial Cycle, the practice of the Ninefold Great Return.

At this time, a single point of utmost yang essence congeals within, concealed in moments of desire stilled and passion quelled. It takes on form and shape. Having reached this stage, breath abides in the embryo, nurtured within and without without the slightest lapse—this is also called the ten-month work.

Moreover, within a single moment of stillness, there lies the work of refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness—not only in ten months. Even within an hour, a day, a month, or a year, it is the same. Sitting with eyes closed, concentrating spirit, calming the heart and regulating breath—this is the work of refining essence into qi. Turning the light inward, focusing spirit in the cinnabar field, allowing true breath to come and go, stillness within reaching its extreme and stirring, movement reaching its extreme and returning to stillness—this is the work of refining qi into spirit.

Thus, true qi returns to the origin, yin and yang revolve and repeat, uniting once more. Naturally, wind subsides and waves grow calm. At this moment, I fix my right mindfulness upon the cinnabar field—this is sealing the firing process. Practicing these three stages of work over months, days, and hours, one does not merely enter the ten-month enclosure.

Thus it is said: In a single moment of circulation, there is a Celestial Cycle for that moment; in an hour, a day, a month, or a year of circulation, there is a Celestial Cycle for that hour, day, month, or year. Yet within a single moment, the first half is warmth, advancing fire, the waxing moon, the upper crescent, the dawn of *zhun*, spring and summer; the latter half is coolness, retreating tally, the waning moon, the lower crescent, the dusk of *meng*, autumn and winter. An hour is divided into the first four moments and the last four, and so too are a day, a month, and a year. This is called gathering and clustering yin and yang, the Five Phases—within a single moment’s work, seizing a year’s qi and seasons.

Having reached this point, it is true emptiness, true stillness. After one or two years, or ten or a hundred, shattering the void to become one with the Great Void—this is the work of refining spirit to return to emptiness.

Once the ten-month work is complete, one must constantly tend to the infant. Step by step, mile by mile, gradually emerging—if one is careless or unrestrained, one may become lost and never return. The immortal scriptures say: *"Spirit enters, qi forms the embryo; qi returns, spirit coalesces into the elixir"*—this is what is meant by *"a single point falls into the Yellow Court."*

Yet those with fewer distracting thoughts attain the elixir sooner, while those with many attain it later. This method is simple, yet people lack the courage to persevere. If one can practice with constancy, one will surely pierce metal and stone, tread water and walk through fire, ascend to heaven and descend to earth. With further accumulation of merit and cultivation of conduct, refining the great medicine of spirit and elixir, one will attain perfection of both form and spirit, ascending in broad daylight with one’s entire household. This depends on the depth of one’s merit.

If one does not refine the spirit elixir but only allows the yang spirit to ascend, looking back at one’s old body as but a heap of dust—even so, one may take wing in broad daylight, enduring for ten thousand kalpas, coeval with the cosmos in eternal spring.

**On the Verification of the Return**

The method of the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions begins with work. First, the true yin within the upper yang orifice is drawn into the inner golden crucible of the qi sea, where it unites with the true yang of the lower orifice. The true yin within yang is one’s own original spirit, belonging to the three *hun*; the true yang of the lower orifice is the original qi within the body, belonging to the seven *po*. When these two qi merge, kan and li naturally unite, *hun* and *po* blend, spirit and qi congeal, and embryonic breathing stabilizes. Each day, like the joy of conjugal union, one must not cling to it—water and fire naturally achieve harmony, circulating through the four limbs like an external fire kindling into flame. Only when water and fire are balanced is this the Small Celestial Cycle.

When the firing process is harmonized and steaming, breath reverses course back to the original sea—then external yang naturally enters within, true fire naturally surges upward, the whole body softens with boundless bliss, and within the abdomen, a living dragon stirs, ascending and descending with countless transformations in a single day. The infant boy and maiden girl naturally unite—this is the stage of gathering yin to supplement yang.

Refining the jade liquid and returning the elixir is the foundation of refining the self, accumulating inner dharmic wealth. One abides in carefree ease, luminous day and night—this is the first step toward longevity and eternal vision. Ordinary people rely on the five grains to sustain life; going without food for days, they perish from qi hunger. If one is aged, with the lower origin depleted and marrow empty, unable to bear the qi of the five grains, then the five grains can nourish but also kill.

If one masters the inner and outer union, achieving harmony of water and fire, the reversal of qi and blood, the convergence of the five viscera’s qi, and the opening of the spleen and stomach—then food entering the abdomen can also transform into qi, generate essence, and nourish spirit. If one truly grasps the celestial mechanism of beginning, waiting until the marrow is full and the navel swells like a pregnant woman’s—though there is no actual fetal form, only qi full, essence abundant, and spirit complete—then with these three in fullness, one proceeds to true refinement, regulating spirit and refining emptiness. This is the time of a great man’s achievement and fulfillment.

I urge students to seek out a lineage master, earnestly pursue the perfected ones, and uncover the celestial mechanisms within and without the body. Clearly understand the swift method of beginning practice, refine the self and await the moment, and wait for the arrival of the first yang.

Select a secluded chamber and refine this Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. It must be a place of profound stillness where no cock crows nor dog barks, and outside, only trusted fellow Daoists should be present—no idle or unfamiliar person may approach, lest the primordial spirit be startled and dispersed.

Earlier I spoke of harmonizing with the world, yet now I speak of seclusion—why? To refine the self amid worldly dust and nurture qi within mountain forests is the moment to enter the chamber and commence practice. To transcend the mundane and enter sainthood—how could this be a trifling matter? One must be unstained by a single speck of dust, free from all cares, utterly unencumbered, cutting all ties as if severing with a blade, forever a wanderer in a foreign land, with no thought of retreat or regret.

Hold emptiness to refine spirit, guard the void to refine nature. Let the five viscera, sinews, bones, qi, and blood of the entire body transform into azure qi. With single-minded devotion, cultivate spirit to perfection, shaping it to obey command. As stars revolve and the Dipper turns, it will change at will. Nurture it until the body bears no wrinkles, like a spider’s form, with the seven orifices radiating light, luminous day and night. When the body becomes like the Great Void, only then is it the proper time to seek the Dao of immortality.

This verifies that qi is full and spirit complete, with abundant dharma wealth—only then can the Great Elixir be refined, and one may truly be called an alchemist. When the work is accomplished, the time will naturally arrive. The seven orifices shine with light, the Three Yangs flourish, and the spirit-sword takes form. Seizing the moment like sailing with wind and tide, one ignites the fire with thunderous roars and lightning flashes, capturing the celestial mechanism beyond the body. At the outset, one seizes and grasps, gathering the true lead from beyond the self, marrying the Dragon to the Tiger, driving the Tiger to join the Dragon.

If one knows how to gather and concentrate without missing the proper moment, the golden essence from the sea-bottom is suddenly drawn up, opening the spine’s passage to ascend to the Mud Pill Palace, then descending into the Crystal Palace, where it unites with the Wood Mercury. In less than half a moment, the gathering is complete, and true fire surges into the four limbs. The entire body’s bones and flesh feel as if scorched by fire or sliced by a blade—this is most difficult to endure. Even the bravest, at this point, will have no control.

Guard against danger and peril, bathing body and mind in ice. When water and fire achieve harmony, in an instant the whole body crackles like roasting beans, bursting open all at once. The body’s qi and blood coalesce into form and speech, clamoring as if gathered in a throng.

Beneath the tongue lie two cavities: the left is the Elixir Well, the right the Stone Spring—this is precisely the Lianquan point. As the bone meridians open, kidney water surges upward like an external spring, impossible to swallow completely, its taste strange and unlike sugar or honey.

Yet the most wondrous moment comes at the outset of tending the furnace: the earth yields its golden lotus, and heaven bestows its precious dew. Suddenly, a drop of true mercury descends, piercing the heart like ice. One then directs a spark of spirit-fire to gather and concentrate it within the Chamber of Union. All at once, it resounds like a thousand drums in battle, roars like ten thousand thunders—yet this is merely the transformation of the body’s hundred meridians, qi, and blood. Do not be alarmed. One must tread the Dipper’s steps, wield the sword, and clasp the seal. Here lies the most perilous point. Three revolutions, nine turns—summoning generals and subduing marshals. With such vigilance, one may witness in the void the Dragon and Tiger in union, heaven and earth in harmony, the sun and moon conjoined. One may see hosts of immortals and buddhas. When the work reaches this stage, myriad visions appear—do not mistake them, lest external demons take hold.

Once the primordial spirit is recognized and mercury and lead unite, after three days the Great Medicine is born. These three days are the most difficult to endure. The entire world becomes a realm of demonic illusions: wailing spirits on all sides, murderous vapors and war smoke in every direction. This is the great opening of the passes. Nine out of ten are terrified to death at this stage. The heart must remain fearless. Though the self has transformed into spirit, it is still yin spirit—yin spirit is most cunning, capable of infinite transformations, and myriad visions may assail. How could it willingly submit? As the ancients said: *"Only when you master the six penetrations can you escape birth and death; if you do not master the six penetrations, do not dream of attaining the Dao in primordial chaos."*

After thirty hours—two and a half days—qi flows unimpeded, reaching its fullness. Suddenly, the living pearl of the Greater Yang reverses its course, leaping from its shell into the mouth. A hundred thousand dragon spirits are struck with awe. This is the true yang elixir of primordial yang. Only upon tasting it does one realize that *"my fate is not ruled by heaven."*

The ancient immortals said: *"Only after this great death does one truly live,"* and *"With one battle, the world is pacified."* This is that very stage—the harmony of heaven and earth, the union of sun and moon. When the true yang medicine enters the mouth, in an instant the fire of the celestial cycle blazes forth. The skeletal frame melts into a mass of flesh, and the yang spirit departs the body, free and unobstructed. With single-minded devotion, hold to emptiness and nurture the void, using emptiness to nourish spirit, the void to nourish the heart, allowing the heart to transform spirit at will.

All things under heaven are born of me; all spirits pay homage and submit as guests. Weary of dwelling in the dusty world, one roams the Peng Isle at leisure. Three thousand jade maidens attend, and daily one feasts at the Peach Assembly, drinking immortal wine, wearing immortal flowers. The four great elements intoxicate, the entire body becomes utterly translucent. The tortoise and snake of the sea-bottom emerge, and ten thousand spirits obey command. Only now are true lead and true mercury inverted, the body enveloped in purple mist and radiant beams—a thousand auspicious vapors. This is the Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons.

After a hundred days of refinement, the Mysterious Pass opens of itself, the infant manifests, and the tortoise and snake appear, naturally entwined. Only at this stage may the adept gather external mercury. After six months of refinement, the body becomes like silver paste, blood transforms into white nectar, and the entire being exudes a fragrant aura. The breath from the mouth forms clouds. This is the maturation of the numinous elixir—a lump of dry mercury. Whoever consumes it will never die and can even revive the dead.

After ten months of refinement, the yang spirit departs the body, and one body can transform into a thousand or ten thousand. Only after twelve months does it seize the full tally of Heaven and Earth, the yang spirit now perfected. The entire body moves in and out as fourteen thousand yang spirits, stepping through sun and moon without shadow, entering metal and stone without obstruction, entering water without drowning, entering fire without burning. Blades and weapons cannot harm it, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it. Its transformations are boundless—it has become a true person.

The entire body’s qi and signs are nothing but true medicine. A chicken that eats it becomes a phoenix, a dog that consumes it becomes a dragon. This principle is so profound even ghosts and spirits struggle to comprehend it. Without having encountered such words, one would surely not believe in the great medicine of the golden elixir.

The work of creation and transformation undergoes three revolutions and nine cycles. Seven returns and eight reversions—fire timing is subtle. The oral instructions for gathering and assembling take only three to five days to overturn Heaven and Earth entirely. All is natural; the yin and yang of the human body’s creation are also natural. Only by embodying the creation of Heaven and Earth can one achieve success.

The matter must be personally experienced and tested until it reaches the state of naturalness. Though the work spans a year, the subtle fire timing lies within a hundred days, and the critical moments of movement and stillness, danger and ferocity, occur within just a few days. In an instant, internal and external forces converge, and in a moment, clarity arises—the sacred embryo is accomplished. It produces a pearl like a grain of millet, which, when swallowed, completes the fire of the celestial cycle. Shedding the husk and changing the bones requires only maintaining emptiness and nurturing the void; the rest unfolds naturally.

If one truly receives guidance from an enlightened teacher, one first refines the self amid the dust of the world, accumulating lead in the marketplace. Gathering years into months, months into days, days into hours—within the great stillness, it all occurs in a single instant, no more than half an hour, overturning Heaven and Earth. After ten months of firing, one embodies the natural law of Heaven and Earth. If one cannot seek life within death, how can one escape the three great calamities?

**On the Consumption of the Great Elixir**
The emoluments of the Three Pure Ones, the provisions of the Jade Emperor—how could those who are not sages and worthies receive them? Like Xu Jingyang, Master Ge, Yin Zhenjun, and over eight hundred others, all attained the Dao before refining and consuming the elixir to deliver the deluded.

The immortals say: *"When the inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir manifests."* This is the true transmission of the ancients. First, accumulate essence and amass qi, gathering the inner and outer dharmic wealth. When the qi is full and the spirit complete, golden light appears, shining day and night without cease. Only then is the inner elixir of one’s body complete, and the outer elixir of one’s body also manifests.

One must not read books by matching them to diagrams like seeking a steed. Only when the medicine sprouts during the time of unceasing brightness day and night may the adept gather the outer medicine of the body, pairing it with the inner yin and yang to obtain the golden elixir. When it enters the mouth, the fire of the celestial cycle ignites, and in an instant, clarity arises—releasing the hand without obstruction. This is the golden cicada shedding its husk, silently ascending to the Emperor on High, encountering immortal ascension, receiving celestial emoluments. Ten thousand spirits pay homage, able to mend Heaven and patch Earth, pluck stars and grasp the moon, command thunder and turn the Dipper, summon wind and call rain. With a single thought, ten thousand spirits obey, making Heaven and Earth appear as one’s palm. This fortune surpasses that of three generations of emperors, this wisdom exceeds that of seven generations of top scholars. Only at this stage may one refine and consume the golden elixir.

This elixir, like a grain of millet, when dropped to the ground, illuminates the sky with golden light—only then is it called the divine elixir. Without spiritual attainment, how dare one speak of consuming the outer elixir! This principle is profound, the celestial mechanism deep and distant. Gold begets gold, silver begets silver—there is no other numinous spirit beyond this. This art of the yellow and white is not the gold and silver of the mortal world. As the mother restrains qi, if one truly receives the correct transmission, one can produce the primordial great medicine. Recognizing the yellow sprout and white snow—this is the yellow and white, the mother that restrains qi to refine the divine elixir. However, all gold, silver, water, and medicine belong to the postnatal realm. Without knowing the true yin and true yang of the same kind, success is utterly impossible.

Alas, scholars of the world cannot distinguish truth from falsehood and do not encounter true masters. They are all blindly cultivating and recklessly refining. Those who truly cultivate life and destiny, if they have not yet met an authentic teacher, should quietly study the texts.

The *Great Auspicious Scripture of the Divine Elixir* does not utter a single empty word or a single false sentence. It is only that later generations fail to recognize orthodoxy and heterodoxy, unaware that the words of sages and worthies are all hidden metaphors. They encounter mediocre teachers, cling to side doors, and let poisonous doctrines enter their hearts without adaptability. Seeming right but wrong, they are self-important and self-righteous, their voices and expressions repelling others from a thousand miles away. Thus, the lofty depart in disdain—how much more so the immortals and sages!

Before encountering a true master, the scholar should be humble and cautious, accumulating merit and virtue. When facing demons, do not retreat; when slandered, do not grow angry. Value the Dao and disdain wealth. Upon meeting a true master, devote oneself wholeheartedly to seeking, swiftly breaking through the two true mechanisms within and without. Suddenly, one awakens to all the texts and is no longer deluded by others.

If one is a gentleman of great aspiration, sincerely devoted to life and destiny, sweeping aside side doors, firmly settling the mind-monkey, resolutely establishing will and qi, humbling the heart and lowering the intent—enduring demonic trials and hardships, earnestly seeking an enlightened teacher—one must exhaustively pursue the origin of the qi received at birth. The origin is the primordial ancestral qi, which unites with a single point of true yang and true yin.

True yang and true yin are born before Heaven and Earth, at the beginning of the primordial chaos. This luminous pearl, like a grain of millet, hangs in the void, radiant and resplendent. Yet without an enlightened teacher to point it out, one remains as if in a drunken dream. Departing from this, all is heterodoxy. This luminous pearl in the void contains all phenomena, conceals all existence, and gives rise to all things—all is this.

A grain of millet—
In the Daoist tradition, this is likened to true lead and true mercury.
Once truly attained, it must not be sought in Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, or male and female,
but only within one’s own body, setting up the furnace and establishing the crucible,
refining the self and upholding the heart.
When principle is illuminated and nature is perceived,
gathering the fire in an instant, within half a moment,
the mysterious pearl of the millet-grain appears above the winding river.
With a single dose taken, in an instant one aperture opens and a hundred meridians align;
the sinews and bones of the entire body, the five viscera and flesh,
all transform into qi, resembling external mercury.
At this stage, a hundred days of firing effort bring forth numinous wonders—
once attained, it is forever held, with no return.
Abiding in the world while preserving form,
refining spirit to return to emptiness,
one becomes one with the Dao.

In the Buddhist tradition, this is called true emptiness and the wondrous awakened nature.
The proper method begins with refining demons to perceive nature;
in a brief moment, the true fire of samadhi arises,
returning to the origin and restoring the root,
unifying all in a single vision.
The great earth becomes treasure,
radiant with ten thousand rays of rosy light,
the five eyes and six penetrations manifest,
and the indestructible vajra-body is forged,
completing the unfathomable mystery beyond ghosts and spirits.

In the Confucian tradition, this is spoken of as the Supreme Ultimate emerging from the Non-Ultimate.
Considering the external Heaven and Earth,
the Non-Ultimate is the vast expanse surrounding Heaven and Earth,
before the separation of sun and moon,
the four directions and above and below,
a state of primordial chaos like yin mist and watery qi.
Only when the time arrives and qi fills to the point of mutual excitation does the Supreme Ultimate arise.
At that moment, sun and moon are born,
clear and turbid separate—
above becomes Heaven, below becomes Earth.
Heaven’s clear qi is pure yang,
Earth’s turbid qi is pure yin.
Rain and dew descend from Heaven—yang generates yin;
the myriad things arise from Earth—yin generates yang.
Heaven and Earth are but emptiness,
encompassing the boundless and infinite.
The stars and deities of Heaven move and turn in their fixed positions;
the myriad things of Earth follow the four seasons and eight solar terms,
naturally arising—
all, in essence, is but emptiness.
The sun and moon are the essence of Heaven and Earth,
illuminating the thirty-three heavens above and the nine abysses and ten thousand springs below,
revolving east and west, ascending and descending,
the cycle of cold and heat.
The sun is the body of pure yang,
containing within a single point of true yin essence—
associated with the Azure Dragon, the Maiden, Wood of Jia, mercury, the Golden Horse, and the three hun-souls, which are external.
The moon is the body of pure yin,
containing within a single point of true yang qi—
associated with the White Tiger, the Infant, Metal of Geng, cinnabar, the Jade Hare, and the seven po-souls, which are internal.

The workings of the human body mirror those of Heaven and Earth;
thus, the human body also possesses true sun and moon.
The Dao is near—why seek it afar?

The three hun-souls pertain to nature, which resides at the edge of Heaven;
the seven po-souls pertain to destiny, which lies at the bottom of the sea.
The interplay of internal and external gives rise to the two words: *nature* and *destiny*—
comprehending these, the myriad volumes of alchemical texts are resolved.
Nature pertains to spirit and is yin;
destiny pertains to qi and is yang.
Thus it is said: “The Dao is called the unity of yin and yang.”
The thousand scriptures and ten thousand volumes are but different names for this.
Yet true nature and destiny, along with illusory phenomena,
remain unknowable without true transmission.

The immortals say:
“The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—
what, then, is yang essence?”
And again:
“Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and marrow—
these seven numinous substances all belong to yin,”
for they are the turbid yin of acquired dregs, not true yin.
True yin stands opposite true yang—
if true yin is unknown, how can true yang be known?
Scholars today not only fail to know true yang,
but also remain ignorant of true yin.
Yet if one knows true yin, one must also know true yang.
Without encountering an enlightened teacher, how can one fathom this?

Scholars must exhaustively seek the wonders of the three talents—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—within their own bodies,
discern the proper furnace and crucible within and without,
and grasp the true workings of yin and yang within and without.
Without attaining the essential teaching,
upon seeing the varied names in texts, the mind lacks certainty,
clinging to heterodox paths without discernment.
Failing to comprehend principle, the heart remains unilluminated;
with an unilluminated heart, one cannot perceive nature;
without perceiving nature, how can one attain destiny?
The ancients said:
*“Only because the golden elixir lacks oral transmission,
how can you be taught where to congeal the numinous embryo?”*
This is the *Guide to Ascending Heaven, Dispelling Delusion*.

The Dao/Way gives birth to Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad things—when released, it encompasses the vastness of empty space; when gathered, it retreats into profound concealment. The Two Modes, sun and moon, and the Five Phases are but the transformations within the Dao/Way. Each thing possesses a Supreme Ultimate, which is the Dao/Way. Within every person’s heart lies the primordial, which is also the Dao/Way. The Five Phases flow in sequence to give rise to humans and beings; when reversed, they produce immortals and buddhas. Thus it is said: *“When the Five Phases flow in sequence, the dharma-realm becomes a fiery pit; when reversed, the great earth yields its seven treasures.”* The essence of the Five Phases is hidden in the secret place of the four great elements—neither within nor without—yet people use it daily without awareness.

The people may be made to follow it, for this is the sequential flow; they cannot be made to know it, for this is the reversed flow. Fish dwell in water yet do not know it as water; humans reside within qi yet do not know it as qi. This analogy demands deep contemplation: turn the light inward, illuminate the heart, and perceive nature—how then could attaining the fruition of immortals or buddhas be difficult? Yet today’s Dao-seekers, each claiming cleverness, boasting of wit, and styling themselves as adepts, never attain true awakening. There are also those of shallow roots and blind eyes who, upon hearing the sages speak of external yin-yang, external furnaces and crucibles, and external medicines, cling to the delusion that women are the crucibles—how pitiful indeed!

I have observed those who ardently pursue the furnace and fire, yet a hundred fail to achieve one success. Some cite the Yellow Emperor’s casting of nine tripods to attain the Dao/Way, mistakenly believing that nine women must be used as crucibles—how utterly misguided! I have seen those who have progressed through five or seven crucibles yet still achieve nothing. Moreover, the moment a thought arises, primordial simplicity scatters; once the primordial is lost, even if the posterior remains, what benefit does it bring to body and heart? It merely sustains the four great elements. Such fools know nothing of Heaven’s silent operation—how the four seasons proceed and the hundred things flourish!

The human body’s transformations mirror those of Heaven and Earth, yet who knows how Heaven attained its singular clarity or Earth its singular stability? And who governs these transformations? If one can take stillness as the body, stability as the foundation, the celestial heart as the master, and the primordial spirit as the function—skillfully employing the mechanism of reversal to restore primordial truth, return to the root, and recover destiny—how could one not ascend to the sacred rank of Heaven and Earth?

As for the matter of employing a literary crucible, there is no such principle. If a person of karmic affinity encounters a true teacher, they should first practice the *jade liquid return to the elixir*, refine the self, harmonize the light, and cultivate through introspection—this is the work of perceiving nature and illuminating the heart. Having perceived nature, one may then seek the higher work: the *golden liquid return to the elixir*, where emotions return to nature, until reaching the state of true emptiness, where great function manifests. The Dragon Girl offers a single precious pearl, and golden light appears—only then is there an attainment that endures.

At the juncture of *hai* and *zi*, between *bo* and *fu*, when the first stirring of the Great Yang arises, one reaches into the moon’s cavern with the hand and treads upon the celestial root with the foot, merging the returning wind—from this arises the wondrous efficacy of a hundred days’ work. This is the *golden liquid return to the elixir*, the great Dao/Way of yin-yang and the Five Phases. Apart from the dual cultivation of nature and destiny through the *jade liquid* and *golden liquid*, and the Dao/Way of stillness and spontaneity, all else are but side doors and lesser methods.

I have established the furnace and crucible within and without my own body, mastered the oral instructions on gathering and refining, and understood the subtleties of medicine, fire, and timing. Yet, unaware of the celestial principles, I entered seclusion to undertake the great work of ingesting the external medicine and kindling the fire. At the secret juncture, when the empty space of the myriad spirits pays homage and celestial music plays above the crown, this matter is beyond even the comprehension of gods and ghosts. Alas, because I had not refined myself amidst the dust of the world, nor accumulated lead in the marketplace, my qi and vessels were not yet fully stabilized, and my foundation was not yet complete. Though principle was harmonized, nature remained unseen. Thus, myriad perils arose, the heart and spirit grew distracted, and I could not maintain control. Without a knowing companion to guard and protect me externally, the slightest sensory disturbance startled my primordial spirit, overturning the crucible and disturbing the furnace. The restless mind-monkey and wayward intent-horse fled, the spirit failed to guard its abode, and qi did not return to the origin—plunging me into the realm of yin demons.

What are yin demons? I shall not elaborate, for later learners would not understand. It is because the true yang scatters and yin qi takes control that, day and night within the body, spirits and ghosts wreak havoc. Whether eyes are open or closed, one sees ghosts and spirits coming and going; even in the ears, one hears their clamor. By day, idle moments are bearable, but at night, it becomes unbearable—one cannot remain still for even a moment. The life-master at the sea of qi in the body, the *dui*-metal’s *wu*-earth, surges upward, and the five viscera’s qi and blood follow, rising beyond control. The body cannot be subdued, and life is forfeit—truly the work of ghostly hands.

I temporarily abandoned my previous efforts, following my teacher’s guidance to conceal myself in the marketplace, accumulate lead amidst worldly dust, gather emotions back to nature, and reverse the mechanism of destruction. From youth to old age, the primordial truth stolen by Heaven, Earth, and beings—I now sought to reclaim it from the emptiness within worldly dust and return it to my celestial nature. Only then were the three treasures—primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit—complete. At last, the heart was illuminated, principle harmonized, nature perceived, the body and heart stabilized, and the Five Phases gathered. Only then could I proceed to the higher work and complete the great Dao/Way.

Reflecting on the sages of former times, many abandoned their practice midway, for they had not refined the self or stabilized the heart, nor had they returned metal to nature. Thus, when they obtained the medicine in the second phase and proceeded to the fourth phase of firing, unaware of the celestial principles and acting with carelessness, even the White Jade Toad lamented *“cutting the autumn bamboo again.”* Who realizes the subtlety, peril, and ferocity of the empty space’s workings? If one cannot seize and subdue it, it will surely not spare them.

If the practitioner discerns the two true workings—within and without the body—with perfect clarity and no obstruction, then they may proceed to nurture and refine, shedding selfishness and restoring the celestial principle. Thus, the work of returning the elixir becomes most simple and effortless. All day, one gathers the Yellow Sprout beyond the body, awaiting the primordial Jade Liquor—this is precisely the wondrous awakening of "drinking wine and wearing flowers" to attain immortality.

As for the state of primordial undifferentiation, there is no intention, no insistence, no fixation, no self; whether living or dying, one forgets both people and things. Like an idler who neglects livelihood, wandering streets and alleys, delighting in sights and soothing the heart, lingering in brothels and taverns, sitting in wordless oblivion—how could this not astonish and perplex the world? To gather the environment and accumulate lead, employing both method and wealth—how could this not invite the ridicule and slander of the vulgar?

Therefore, one must rely on powerful families in great metropolises for external protection, perceiving the Dao in plain sight while concealing one’s light and obscuring one’s traces. The immortals say: *"To covet the treasure of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world."* The treasure of heaven does not refer to the sky above but to the dwelling of the Nine Yang Cauldron within the body—thus did the Yellow Emperor cast the Nine Tripods and ascend. Yet deluded fools, upon hearing the words *"treasure of heaven,"* fixate on the sun and moon in the sky, taking the moon’s emergence in the *geng* direction as true water and true lead, using their eyes to measure degrees and gather it; or at the sun’s rise in the *mao* hour, they likewise employ their eyes to gather it as true fire and true mercury.

The heavens above and earth below, *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li*, the inner and outer furnaces of male and female—these are all metaphors for the inner and outer yin and yang of one’s own body, without any actual form of male or female. The immortals say: *"Whatever has form is all delusion."* The returning elixir has no substance—how profound are these words!

Those in the world who cultivate goodness never engage in harming others for personal gain. What men and women in the cosmos rely upon to live without dying is none other than this single point of yang essence. How could one who seeks immortality steal a woman’s essence to benefit their own body? How does this differ from those who kill? Moreover, the ancient sages spoke of *"that household’s male and female,"* *"the two families,"* *"the two nations,"* and *"the inner and outer furnaces"*—if one does not receive the correct transmission, how few will avoid misinterpretation?

I once encountered an enlightened teacher who, through direct instruction and personal guidance, revealed the two true workings within and beyond the empty space. Daring not keep this secret for myself, I transgressed the prohibitions to pass it on. The creation of heaven, earth, and humanity; the scriptures of the Three Teachings; the medicines and firing times; the union of sun and moon; the measures of waxing and waning—all these I have fully disclosed, not through written words but through true speech, so that practitioners may avoid the errors of misguided cultivation. Wherever this book resides, spiritual beings guard it. If one without affinity chances upon it, it will be no more than the blind singing empty verses.

The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is rarely encountered even in ten thousand kalpas—*"tramping in straw sandals yet finding nowhere to seek, yet gaining it without effort."* If the practitioner can nurture this square inch of the heart amidst haste, turmoil, displacement, and hardship, preserving it without loss, then the celestial principle is restored. Once the celestial principle is restored, one may then seek the higher work of ingesting the external medicine, and in an instant, become serene, shedding the mortal coil and transforming the bones, merging entirely into a single golden light, transmuting the great earth into treasure.

The body generates another body beyond itself; the yang spirit departs the form, embracing emptiness and nurturing the void—this is the Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons, attaining boundless freedom and transcending the three kalpas of wind, water, and fire, no longer subject to birth, aging, sickness, death, or suffering. Yet people today do not cultivate the Way but instead covet external elixirs and alchemical concoctions—this is the height of delusion.

This chapter is the concluding section of *Mysterious Essentials*, a general discourse on the sentiments of the Dao. *"Guiding the Lost to Ascend Heaven"* is the overarching title for the verses on the Dao’s sentiments. The closing line—*"if seen by the unworthy, it is but the blind singing empty verses"*—makes clear that this is a general discourse on the Dao’s sentiments.

**Commentary on the *Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: Dragon-Tiger Lead-Mercury Treatise***

The Daoist Lord’s discourse on the extraction and replenishment of dragon-tiger lead and mercury is intended for those of the future with roots and affinity to begin their practice here. Though it is said, *"Only immortals can become immortals,"* I insist that *"even mortals can become immortals."* The only fear is not understanding the principle of the Golden Elixir—then one truly enters hell to become a beast.

This dragon pertains to yang; once yang is lost, all becomes yin. This tiger pertains to yin; within yin lies the treasure, which is a single yang. The dragon is the mysterious pass of the self; the tiger is the mysterious gate of the other. The dragon is lustful, yet I do not leak—adding a drop of water to a bit of earth forms the character *yao* (瑶), becoming the supreme treasure of Jade Liquor. The tiger is voracious, yet I do not leak—adding the true fire to the character *jian* (柬) forms *lian* (炼), gathering the supreme treasure of Golden Liquor.

Tiger, tiger, tiger—fear not your gaping maw and fanged jaws, striking terror into hearts and souls. I possess the hand of the tiger-tamer, reducing you to emptiness within form and form within emptiness. With the dragon’s playful touch, I make you the meeting of dragon and tiger amidst wind and clouds, unafraid that you will not yield your tiger cub from the tiger’s den, entering my Three Fields.

Dragon, dragon, dragon—though you are a creature of lust and desire, I possess the hand of the dragon-subduer. Fear not your endless transformations—I use Nezha’s vajra ring to bind you, extracting your sinews to fashion a golden belt for nurturing nature and connecting life, worn always. How could you not then approach the True One of the Great Ultimate to request the unparalleled Dharma-door of the True One, merging with me into the Great Way of primordial unity?

Lead is the lead of the two bowstrings, mercury is the mercury of heaven and earth within my body. With the radiance of sun and moon, heaven and earth become "Earth-Heaven Peace" rather than "Heaven-Earth Obstruction." Since birth from parents, the human body originally possesses one mercury and one lead—the principle of male-female union. Thus it is said: *"Qian is father, Kun is mother; male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things transform into purity."* *"The Changes are the Primordial Ultimate of pre-heaven."*

Yet people fail to grasp this principle: they only cast mercury into lead, begetting sons and daughters, rather than casting lead into mercury to become buddhas and immortals. This iron mantou can shatter all obstacles—how could one not become the Three Abundances within Three Abundance?

**Annotation on Lüzu’s *Hundred-Character Stele*:**
*Nurture qi, forget words, and guard the One.*
All cultivators must first nurture qi. The method lies in forgetting words and guarding the One. Forgetting words prevents qi from scattering; guarding the One keeps spirit from departing. The secret says: *"Seal the tongue, still the mind; embrace spirit, settle the heart."*

*Subdue the heart to refrain from action.*
The human heart is ceaselessly restless. For cultivators seeking stillness, mastery lies in subduing the two eyes. The eyes are the gates of the heart—lower the lids, seal the orifices. Treat all matters as if the heart were a sword: deem worldly affairs profitless, sever them with blazing resolve, and never cling. The secret says: *"Gaze from eyes to nose, from nose to navel; upper and lower align, heart and breath interdepend. Focus intent on the Mysterious Pass—thus thoughts are subdued."*

*In movement and stillness, know the Ancestral Origin.*
Movement and stillness are the interplay of yin and yang. The Ancestral Origin is the source of embodied life. Cultivators must recognize the state before parents’ birth—this is the Mysterious Transformation. Where the body’s Qian and Kun, the Eight Trigrams, the Five Phases, and the Four Images converge is the state before heaven and earth divided, formed from a single luminous spark—the Great Ultimate. Below the heart and above the kidneys, within the nebulous center where thoughts arise without cease—this is the Ancestral Origin. Movement and stillness mean harmonizing true qi and stabilizing true essence. Inhaling connects to the Root of Heaven; exhaling connects to the Root of Earth—closing the gate is Kun, opening the gate is Qian. Exhalation makes the dragon chant and clouds rise; inhalation makes the tiger roar and winds stir. With each opening and closing, movement and stillness, the key is to keep the heart-mind unmoved, allowing true breath to flow naturally, continuous and unbroken. Refine breath to the breathless breath, forging it into oneness—thus spirit congeals, and the elixir is achieved.

*If no affairs arise, who else is there to seek?*
If one can nurture qi, forget words, and guard the One, subduing body and mind so spirit returns to the qi-cavern, intent fixed within the compass, merging into a single qi—like a hen brooding an egg, like a dragon nurturing a pearl, ever-present and unwavering—then with time and deep practice, the millet-grain pearl will naturally manifest, radiant as the sun. Silently transforming the primordial spirit, its numinous clarity is unfathomable—this is the Way.

*The True Constant must respond to phenomena; responding to phenomena requires non-delusion.*
This Dao is the True Constant. Yet engaging with affairs easily leads to confusion, so one must not be deluded by worldly matters. If one refuses all engagement, one falls into hollow emptiness. Instead, respond when matters arise, then let them go without attachment. Radiant and upright—this is non-delusion. True nature is pure; primordial spirit congeals. The secret says: *"Intent misplaced leads to error; non-action falls into void. When nature is undeluded, it abides; when nature abides, qi naturally returns."*

The human nature is fiery and volatile—joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure; love, aversion, desire, and hatred—ever-changing, stirred by the slightest touch, giving rise to delusive thoughts that disrupt stillness. One must truly quell anger to descend fire, truly diminish desire to ascend water. When the body is unmoving, it is *refining essence*—refining essence makes the tiger roar, and primordial spirit solidifies. When the heart is unmoving, it is *refining qi*—refining qi makes the dragon chant, and primordial qi is preserved. When intent is unmoving, it is *refining spirit*—refining spirit makes the two qi merge, the Three Origins blend, and primordial qi naturally returns. The Three Origins are essence, qi, and spirit; the two qi are yin and yang. When cultivators respond to phenomena without delusion, primordial spirit returns of itself, and true nature abides. When nature abides, the body’s pre-heaven qi returns, life is restored to its root—what difficulty remains?

The secret says: *"Turn light inward, reflect within the heart; inner thoughts do not stray, outer thoughts do not enter. When qi returns, the elixir forms of itself; within the crucible, Kan and Li unite."*

When cultivators are undeluded by worldly affairs, qi returns of itself. Then the two qi ascend and descend in the Central Palace, yin and yang unite in the elixir crucible. Suddenly, a wisp of warm qi from the kidneys surges into the heart’s palace—emotion returns to nature, like husband and wife in union, enraptured and intoxicated. The two qi intertwine, forming the elixir’s substance. Within the qi-cavern, water and fire intermingle in ceaseless circulation—spirit rides qi, qi stabilizes form, and without extraneous techniques, one attains longevity. The secret says: *"The three treasures—ears, eyes, mouth—seal them, do not let them leak. The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and wandering, guarding the compass."* Until the elixir field is full and the knife-point elixir forms.

*Yin and yang generate reversal; universal transformation sounds as a single thunderclap.*
At this stage, spirit does not stray outward, qi does not leak, spirit returns to the qi-cavern, Kan and Li have united. With ever-greater vigor and dedication, reaching the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the body rests in the boundless dark, the heart settles in the realm of nothingness—then true breath abides of itself, the hundred vessels cease, sun and moon pause in their course, the celestial pivot halts. The Great Ultimate is still yet generates movement; yang arises in Kun of the southwest. Kun is the abdomen, also called the Winding River.

Suddenly, a single spark of numinous light appears, no larger than a millet grain—this is the sign of the elixir’s birth. With a blazing radiance piercing through, the two kidneys seethe like boiling water, the bladder scorches as if roasted by fire. Within the abdomen, a roar like a howling gale arises; within the belly, a sound like rolling thunder resounds—this is the revelation of the *Heavenly Root* in the *Returning* hexagram.

As the Heavenly Root manifests, stabilize the heart-king and assist it with spirit, so that the qi, like fire pressing metal, ascends, piercing through the *Weilü* gate. Gently guide it, silently lift it—a harmonious mass of qi, like thunder’s shock, rises to the *Mud Pill Palace*, surging through the entire body. This is the *Heavenly Wind* hexagram of *Encounter*. From the *Moon Cavern* to the space between the brows, the primordial light leaks forth—this is the Great Ultimate moving and generating yin. It transforms into divine water, sweet dew, within which a millet-grain pearl descends into the *Yellow Court*, touching my spirit-mercury within *Li*, coalescing into the sacred form. One cycle of the *Fire Times* of the *Celestial Circuit* is completed. Refine it, temper it, and the elixir will crystallize of itself.

White clouds gather at the crown; sweet dew sprinkles *Mount Sumeru*. At this stage, the elixir is attained. The two qi congeal into the knife-point elixir; the gates and cavities open and align. Fire descends, water ascends—one qi circulates throughout. From the movement of the Heavenly Root within the Great Ultimate, passing the *Mysterious Valley Pass*, ascending through the twenty-four joints of the spine to the *Heavenly Valley Pass*, yin arises in the *Moon Cavern*. A fragrant, sweet savor descends the *Double Towers*, ceaseless and unending—this is called *"Sweet Dew Sprinkles Mount Sumeru."*

The oral instruction states: When the mouth is full of sweet dew, guide it with the eyes, receive it with the mind, and send it down to the elixir cauldron to congeal and nurture the primordial qi. Drinking the *Elixir of Immortality* oneself, who could know of this carefree joy?

At this stage of nurturing qi, the joints of the bones have opened, the divine water flows without cease, circulating up and down, ceaselessly coming and going. Swallow it from time to time—this is called the *Elixir of Immortality*. The oral instruction states: *"Flowing pearls irrigate and nourish the numinous root-nature—does the cultivator know or not?"*

Sitting, one hears the music of the immortals, as if from strings unplucked, clearly penetrating the workings of creation. At this stage of practice, the ears perceive the melodies of the immortals, along with the rhythms of bells and drums. The five qi converge at the origin; the three flowers gather at the crown—like evening crows returning to roost. The field of the heart opens and brightens; wisdom arises of itself. The three teachings’ scriptures become clear; past lives’ roots are silently comprehended. Future fortunes and misfortunes are foreknown. Mountains and rivers of the great earth lie as if in the palm of one’s hand; the gaze spans ten thousand miles. The six penetrations’ wonders are attained—this is no mere illusion.

I have truly reached this stage in my practice. Were I to utter falsehoods and mislead later students, Heaven would surely punish me. To encounter this and not practice it is to incur Heaven’s condemnation. Without meeting a teacher, this matter is difficult to know.

In all, twenty lines—these are the true steps to Heaven’s ladder. From *"Nurturing Qi, Forgetting Words"* to these twenty lines, all are the authentic oral instructions of Ancestor Lü, without a trace of falsehood, the very staircase to ascension in cultivation. Those who awaken to this instruction and its commentary should hasten to practice it. Do not recklessly disclose it, nor show it to the unworthy, lest you incur Heaven’s punishment. Cherish and uphold it, and you will ascend to the Heavenly Palace.

Ancestor Lü embraced the vast vow to deliver all beings and transmitted this *Hundred-Character Stele*; Ancestor Zhang embraced the great vow to deliver all beings and annotated this *Hundred-Character Stele*. The heart of Ancestor Zhang is the heart of Ancestor Lü. Thus it is said: *Pure Yang* and *Three Peaks* are the eyes and ears among immortals.

Written in the tenth month.
The Dao speaks in simple terms.

The Dao, in its stages, must be understood through the three periods and three passes. In essence, it does not exceed these four phrases: *"After non-action, follow with action; after action, return again to non-action."* The practice of internal alchemy likewise has its lesser three periods: accumulating essence and amassing qi as the first, opening the passes and expanding the apertures as the second, and laying the foundation and refining the self as the third. To begin with the first period, one must generally calm the heart and reduce desires, first seal the outer Three Treasures to nurture the inner Three Treasures. As the *Xici* states: *"Exhaust principle and fulfill nature to reach destiny"*—this is the Daoist progression, a step-by-step practice. What is meant by exhausting principle? Study the true canon, seek the true instructions, observe the workings of creation, contemplate the *He-Luo*, seize moments of leisure to preserve qi, and guard the spirit to lay the foundation. While exhausting principle on one hand, fulfill nature on the other, thereby securing an indestructible body to pursue the wondrous medicine of immortality. Nature is internal, destiny is external; joining the internal with the external and uniting them as one, the Great Dao is accomplished. The phrase *"to reach"* clearly contains the oral instruction of establishing nature and destiny, and of returning from the postnatal to the prenatal—yet those without sincerity will seek further within the instructions to resolve it.

The eight characters *"concentrate the spirit and regulate the breath, regulate the breath and concentrate the spirit"* are the foundational practice. One must proceed with single-minded devotion, advancing through the stages without interruption. To concentrate the spirit is to gather the already-cleansed heart and enter within. When the heart is not yet clear, do not rashly close the eyes; first encourage and exhort oneself, and only when it returns, cool and tranquil, may one draw it into the qi cavity—this is called concentrating the spirit. Once the spirit is concentrated, one sits as upon a high mountain gazing over all peaks and rivers, or as a heavenly lamp illuminating the nine depths and nine obscurities—this is what is meant by *"concentrating the spirit in emptiness."*

Regulating the breath is not difficult: when the heart and spirit are still, the breath follows naturally. I merely guard its spontaneity, directing the light of spirit downward—this is regulating the breath. To regulate the breath is to harmonize the breath of the Yin Heel Vessel with the qi in the heart, meeting within the qi cavity. When the heart ascends to the region below the navel, it is called *"doubting the spirit"*; when qi returns to the region below the navel, it is called *"regulating the breath."* Spirit and breath depend on each other; guarding their natural purity is *"not forgetting,"* following their natural purity is *"not forcing."* Neither forgetting nor forcing, acting with silence and softness, the breath becomes lively and the heart at ease. Here, apply the *"boring"* technique: use emptiness as the dwelling place of the heart, and profound stillness as the homeland of spirit and breath. After repeated efforts, refining again and again, spirit and breath suddenly forget each other, and spirit and qi merge. Unawares, yang arises in a trance, and one feels as if intoxicated—this is the true sign, the moment when the Mysterious Pass appears.

All terms in the alchemical canon such as *"prenatal,"* *"true,"* and *"original"* emerge from the cauldron of yin and yang, born after the profound obscurity of deep stillness—like the sages and perfected beings at the dawn of the primordial chaos. Henceforth, when reading alchemical classics, one may infer by analogy.

Learning the Dao is most difficult; transmitting it is also not easy. If those who transmit the Dao are so diligent, can those who learn it be lazy?

Those who transmit the Dao must endure hardship—can those who learn it be impatient? If one’s study is not refined, effort not diligent, heart not pure, and spirit not true, entering the Dao by such means will yield not a single success in ten thousand attempts.

Confucius said, *"To know the incipient is to be divine."* He did not speak of thought or intention but of spirit—clearly, the subtlest movement of breath cannot be known except by spirit. Now let us distinguish: the subtlest movement is the incipient, while the overt movement is the direct. To know the incipient, employing heart, intention, or thought will never reveal it.

Spirit! Spirit! Only when spirit is truly spirit does it qualify as prenatal. True spirit is true thought, true heart, true intention. How to discern what is true? The secret lies in this: when the fire of the Mysterious Pass ignites and profound obscurity suddenly awakens, that solitary, luminous awareness—*that* is it.

The alchemical tradition says, *"A single thought arises from the compass of the rule"*—this is true spirit, true thought. It also says, *"Within the faintest glimmer, the light of the heart appears"*—this is true spirit, true heart. And again, *"Wisdom arises in stillness, a single intention governs"*—this is true spirit, true intention. True spirit is refined from what is not spirit; let the learner take note.

The student of the Dao must originally break through conventional patterns to guide the heart into principle. When the heart of fervor departs, the heart of coolness arrives; when the human heart is extinguished, the Dao-heart appears. This is why I abandon fame, power, and profit, forsake children, family, and home.

To truly learn the Dao, one must treat it as a rare commodity to be hoarded—only then will there be results. The Great Dao takes cultivating the heart and refining nature as its foundation. Nature resides within the heart, while the heart envelops nature. Nature is the master of settled principle; the heart is the dwelling where nature abides.

To cultivate the heart is to preserve it—fortifying the city walls so the house does not collapse, which is the work of laying the foundation. To refine nature is to nurture it—watering and tending the roots so the inner medicine matures, which is the work of self-cultivation. When the heart is bright and nature at peace, passions and desires do not intrude, thoughts and worries vanish, and heart and nature stand open within and without, free from vexation or distress—this is the effect of cultivating the heart and refining nature, the inner elixir.

Some study the Dao for months yet make no progress, for they lack a sincere heart turned toward the Dao. If one’s heart is set upon the Dao, naturally it will be untroubled by worldly affairs; if the heart values the Dao, naturally it will be light toward worldly matters; if the heart is deeply devoted to the Dao, naturally it will be indifferent to worldly concerns.

Guard your nature so it does not scatter; preserve your spirit so it does not grow dull—how then could drowsiness or stray thoughts disturb you?

Alas! When principle prevails over desire, one is preserved; when desire prevails over principle, one is lost.

Plunge the heart into the abyss, and spirit will not wander outward. When the heart is entangled in affairs, fire stirs within. When fire stirs within, essence is inevitably shaken. When the heart is still, breath naturally harmonizes; when stillness endures, the heart naturally settles.

Put the heart to death to nourish qi; still the mechanism of the mind to purify the heart. Essence, qi, and spirit are the three inner treasures; ear, eye, and mouth are the three outer treasures. Always ensure the inner three do not wander after external things, and the outer three do not penetrate within to disturb. Let breath be continuous and deep, entering the cinnabar field. Let breath be husband and wife, spirit and qi be mother and child—when mother, child, husband, and wife gather without parting, the heart does not stray outward, intention does not wander in thought, spirit does not roam, and essence does not move recklessly. Constantly steaming the four limbs, this is the orthodox lineage of the golden elixir.

The Great Dao enters through the character *"center."* This *"center"* has two aspects: one within the body, one beyond it. The work must proceed in two layers.

First, seek the center within the body. As Master Zhu said, *"Guard the center to control the external."* To guard the center, one must turn the light inward, return the gaze, and focus attention within the compass—at the point one inch and three-tenths below the navel, neither clinging nor departing. This is seeking the center within the body.

Second, seek the center beyond the body. The *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of *"before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise."* At this unarisen moment, one neither hears nor sees, vigilantly guarding solitude. Naturally, nature settles and spirit clears; when spirit is clear, qi becomes wise. Only then does one see the original face. This is seeking the center beyond the body.

By using the center within the body to seek the center beyond it, human desires are easily purified, and heavenly principle is restored to brightness. The sages, immortals, and buddhas of all ages have taken this as the first step in their work.

In seated meditation, the most essential practice is to concentrate spirit and regulate breath—calm and composed, neither forcing nor forgetting. There is none who does not daily advance in skill.

To concentrate spirit and regulate breath, one need only make the heart level and qi harmonious. When the heart is level, spirit gathers; when qi is harmonious, breath is regulated. The character *"level"* in *"level heart"* is most wondrous. A heart without waves is level; a heart that holds to the center is level. *"Level"* resides in this center. When the heart is in this center, it does not stir waves. This center is the Mysterious Pass of the alchemical classics.

Without knowing the Mysterious Pass, no matter what else one does, it is like entering a dark room—where to begin? The Mysterious Pass is the qi cavern. The qi cavern is where spirit enters qi, as if dwelling in a deep cave. When spirit and qi long for each other, the substance of the Mysterious Pass is established.

The ancient immortals said, *"To regulate breath, regulate the true breath; to refine spirit, refine the spirit that is not spirit."* The true breath is the breath that breathes itself; the spirit that is not spirit is the spirit that is spirit itself.

Above all, eliminate the human heart and preserve the Dao-heart. Return this Dao-heart to emptiness and nothingness, dwelling in profound obscurity within the compass—only then can one nourish the true breath and attain the spirit that is not spirit.

Begin with the inner breath, for this is where one departs from the breath of parents and reestablishes the womb’s nurturing ground—here alone can merit be cultivated. As the mother breathes in, so do you; as she breathes out, so do you, as if reborn anew. In seated practice, embrace spirit with qi, bind intent to breath, and let them coil and drift within the cinnabar field, gathering without scattering. There, the inner qi and the qi drawn from without intertwine in the cinnabar field. Day by day, month by month, they flourish, extending to the four limbs, flowing through the hundred vessels, striking open the twin passes of the spine to ascend to the muddy pellet, then circling back down to the crimson palace and returning to the lower cinnabar field. Spirit and qi guard each other, breath upon breath interdependent—the path of the river chariot is open. At this stage, half the merit of laying the foundation is achieved; all that remains is to refine with diligent emptiness.

Regulate the breath by following the postnatal breath to seek the true person’s breath. As the ancients said: *"The postnatal breath stirs a gentle wind, which rouses the true person’s breath."* Yet in regulating the postnatal breath, one must let it regulate itself, for only then can the prenatal breath be awakened. I need only attain emptiness and preserve stillness. Once the true breath stirs, the Mysterious Pass is not far.

Proceed thus in practice, and the foundation may be attained with ease, not requiring a hundred days. The *Daodejing*’s lines *"Attain utmost emptiness, preserve profound stillness"* may be interpreted as a whole or parsed in detail. Taken as a whole, they simply instruct one in the practice of entering concentration. Parsed in detail: *emptiness* is the void, *utmost* is the central pole, *stillness* is tranquility, and *profound* is single-minded devotion. That is to say, guide one’s spirit into the space of the void and align it with the central pole, guard the spirit within tranquility, and devote oneself wholly to the work. The human heart is twofold—one true, one deluded. Thus, to seek the true heart, one must not generate deluded thoughts; this is the true heart. The true heart’s nature is most vast and luminous; its dwelling is most serene and unconstrained. With the true heart, one comprehends a thousand texts as one; with the true heart, one traces the myriad paths to their single source.

Yet if one wishes to employ the true heart in worldly affairs, one must first cultivate its strength and preserve its tranquility—only then can it labor without exhaustion and respond without disturbance. The alchemical verse says: *"When the heart wanders, draw it back; having drawn it back, release it. After use, seek stillness again; in stillness, awakening arises."* Who says one cannot attain stillness amid bustle? Wandering in cities or sitting in barren halls is not the Way. Yet if one does not wander through cities and mountains, one should let qi wander through the body’s passes and orifices; if one does not sit in hollow halls, one should let spirit sit within the body’s wondrous apertures.

The study of the Dao takes the foundation of the elixir as its root. Once the elixir foundation is solidified, one may return home to till the soil and care for parents, living as a refined scholar for some years before entering the mountains to seek a teacher and complete the great Dao. Those who abandon their families, forsake their wives, chant scriptures, and burn incense are merely idlers passing time—what worth do they have?

Preserving the body hinges on calming the heart and nourishing the kidneys. When the heart is calm, the fire of *li* does not flare outward; when the kidneys are nourished, the water of *kan* does not spill outward. If fire does not flare, there is no illness of spirit’s agitation, and the heart grows ever calmer; if water does not spill, there is no exhaustion of essence, and the kidneys grow ever clearer. When the kidneys are clear, the fire of life does not surge upward; when the heart is calm, the fire of spirit can shine downward. When spirit and essence congeal, one may ward off illness and speak of cultivation.

In nurturing spirit and qi, spirit serves as the master that gathers qi. Gather one part qi, and you gain one part treasure; gather ten parts qi, and you gain ten parts treasure. Qi is so precious that even a hundred taels of gold or jade cannot exchange for a single part. Why should a Daoist contend with the world for profit? Profit breeds resentment, resentment belongs to fire, and qi is also a kind of fire. When resentment arises, qi flees with it, and one cannot retain it. In severe cases, both mother and child scatter and vanish. Thus, in nurturing qi, nothing is more urgent than curbing resentment; to curb resentment, nothing is more urgent than nurturing the heart and spirit.

Rank and fame often arise unexpectedly—one must not harbor a mind set on official emolument. Confucius said: *"In learning, emolument lies within."* The same holds for cultivating the Dao: one must not greedily anticipate results. In every seated session, one must still the heart and congeal the spirit, not allowing the slightest thought of calculation or expectation to arise. Simply hold fast to the inner breath and work at it.

The method of refining the heart proceeds from small to great. In the scorching heat of the third *fu*, a single bowl of rice suffices—do not seek more; a slight coolness suffices—do not seek greater chill; a few mosquitoes are not to be feared—do not insist on their absence. From the minute to the vast, every moment presents an opportunity to refine the heart. Seeking sweetness in bitterness, life in death—this is the guiding principle of Daoist cultivation.

Though the Way of the golden elixir is said to be easy to know but hard to practice, one cannot refrain from seeking knowledge as the ground for practice. If knowledge is not upright, where can practice lead? If knowledge is not precise, where can practice enter? If knowledge is not yet mature, how can one speak of oral instructions?

Those who study the Dao must purify the heart and clear the mind to obtain the true medicine of clarity. Do not indulge the temperament’s nature, do not mobilize the spirit of thought, do not employ the qi of breathing, do not use the essence of intercourse. Yet when does true essence stir? Where is true spirit born? In what direction does true qi move? Where is true nature nurtured? These are matters that must be clearly distinguished and meticulously explained.

The qi of wisdom naturally clears the spirit, for qi is the temporal manifestation of the spirit within the human body—what difficulty is there in knowing this? The sole concern is that the heart is not still and settled. Drawing in qi is the first crucial step in cultivating the Dao; if one does not still the heart and investigate meticulously, one cannot know the end or the beginning—how then can one begin practice? To proceed in confusion, knowing this but not that, the heart grows ever more frantic, perpetually scattered and unable to gather. Thus, the originally unified heart divides into many, and how can one cultivate with a single heart? Those who study the Dao must be wholeheartedly sincere, striking with one decisive blow to avoid waging endless battles. Whenever beginning seated meditation, one must still both heart and spirit, empty and quiescent, such that even spirits and gods cannot perceive it. This practice should be self-examined and self-trusted, seeking self-realization. What is meant by "making the intent sincere" is to refrain from self-deception. Sincerity within naturally manifests without, which is why the noble person must be vigilant in solitude.

—Excerpts from Master Sanfeng’s Compiled Teachings—
The Master said: "The Azure Grotto Heaven has long been frequented by immortals and perfected beings, who have left behind elixir formulas—this too is the heart of awakening the world and delivering others. Why should those in the mountains seek other transcendent herbs or gather different immortal blossoms? This alone is the talisman of salvation, the medicine of longevity. Now, I have specially excerpted and preserved these teachings to share with those who cherish the Dao."

Master Baizi Qing’s *Formula for Regulating Breath* states: Regulating the breath involves method, implements, and firing times—these three interweave in subtle harmony. One must know them thoroughly, ponder them deeply, and then apply them with effortless mastery.

The firing times in breath regulation include:
- **Gathering breath**: One must be empty and humble, so that essence may enter the crucible—this is the method of "shrinking the earth."
- **Harvesting breath**: The spirit must remain unmoved and unshaken, so that the medicine naturally takes form—this is the "grasping clouds" technique.
- **Union breath**: One must attain the great stillness of the six extremes, with not a single thought arising.
- **Advancing fire breath**: The intent drives it forward—this is "arousing the Xun wind and moving the Kun fire."
- **Withdrawing tally breath**: The spirit gathers it in—this is "returning to the root and restoring life."
- **Mao-You bathing breath**: It is merely the soft character *rou*.

All these methods of breath regulation must be cross-referenced with the proper method, implements, and firing times. "Regulating" means adjusting and harmonizing them appropriately.

Master Zi Qing’s *Secret of the Mysterious Pass* states: The Mysterious Pass is the gateway to seeking the mysterious, the mechanism of the wondrous. It has both substance and function. What is meant by "substance"?

Still and unmoving.
What is meant by "function"?
Stimulated, it then penetrates.

There are times when it does not move.
At the first union of spirit and qi, subtle and interwoven, vast and boundless—this is one pass, the place where the Four Elements and Five Phases do not adhere.
At the moment of spirit and qi’s union, dim and silent, profound and obscure—this is another pass, the state of no sound or scent, no inside or outside.
When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, function then emerges: continuous and unbroken, rising and surging. True qi stirs within the compass—this is yet another pass, the place where the arising thought is the Mysterious Female.
When the thought arises, as if drunk and then sobered, a numinous awareness remains. In that instant, one awakens—this is another pass, the moment when timing meets spirit’s knowing.
Here, one employs this numinous awareness like a thread pulling a puppet: the mechanism moves, qi flows, and with the slightest urging, it passes through the Gate of Wei Lü—this is yet another pass, the time when the Dipper’s handle turns and the Northern Asterism is set aright.
Bathing at the Mao Gate is another pass.
Soaring to the Mud Pill Palace is another pass.

Returning to the root and reviving the mandate is another pass. Bathing at the You Gate is yet another pass. Great rest, great stillness—emptied and forgotten, returning to utmost quiescence is another pass.

Such is the substance and function of the Mysterious Pass. All the thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises are contained herein.

Master Zi Qing’s *Lu Ding Jue* states: *"The Four Hundred Characters"* should be studied closely, especially the verse *"This aperture is no ordinary aperture,"* which exhausts the subtleties of the crucible and vessel.

The term *"this aperture"* may be viewed in two aspects: inner and outer. *"No ordinary"* is a word of praise. When Qian and Kun unite, it forms the outer aperture; when spirit and qi are concealed within, it becomes the inner aperture. When spirit and qi intermingle, Kan and Li arise; when Kan and Li intermingle, primordial essence is produced. This essence is no common essence—it is the supreme treasure of the White Tiger’s first meridian. Whoever attains it ascends instantly to the immortal realm. This pertains to the Reverted Elixir.

As for the minor elixir, one may explain to others thus: *"This aperture is no ordinary aperture, formed by the union of yin and yang. Named the Cavern of the Two Qi, within it true yang is born."* Thus may it be clearly understood.

The immortals’ three secrets are: fire timing, medicinal substance, and crucible-vessel. This poem encompasses the marvels of the crucible-vessel.

Master Zi Qing’s *Dong Ji Lun* states: Confucius said, *"The subtle is the incipient movement."* He also said, *"The Creative’s movement is straight."* Mencius spoke of *"nurturing with straightness"*—by cultivating the subtle movement of straightness until it becomes great, it fills the space between heaven and earth. Straightness is the qi of firmness, the first yang line of Qian, the initial nine, the *"one"* attained by Yanzi. Straightness and oneness are one. Movement resides within the human aperture, present in all twelve hours. The essential is to preserve it through stillness, then observe it through movement.

Within the flavorless, seek flavor; within the uneventful, seek event—is this not the way? Lu Qianxu, styled Xianhui, was transmitted the Way by Master Huian of the Jiajing era. His *Lun Tiao Xi Fa* states:

*What is *"not forgetting"*?*
*Abiding by nature.*

*What is *"not forcing"*?*
*Following nature.*

*How to abide?*
*By relying on the breath.*

*How to follow?*
*By equalizing the breath.*

Relying on the breath, the breath becomes unobstructed; equalizing the breath, the breath becomes even.

*Is *"abiding"* distinct from *"following"*? Or are they one?*
Knowing how to abide, one knows how to follow; knowing how to follow, one knows how to abide. Whether two or one, the principle is not amiss. From the broad, return to the essential—this lies solely in concentrating the spirit. Do not employ intention; if intention is used, it is not true intention. True intention arises from stillness, like the primordial separation of the great simplicity, free from attachment—only then can it be employed. Thus, one must die to know life; without knowing life, one does not know death. Life and death are the profound mechanism of movement and stillness.

Master Qianxu’s *You Lun Tiao Xi Fa* states: In regulating the breath to guide inhalation, one need only concentrate the spirit into the qi cavern. With the spirit dwelling in the qi cavern, silently focus on the yin heel vessel. Without seeking union, it unites of itself; without striving for connection, it connects of itself. As the ancient immortals aptly said: *"The principle of spirit conjoining across form is most detailed."* This is what is meant by *"the spirit leaving form to join qi"*—there is a separate oral transmission.

*"Men do not loosen their garments; women do not untie their sashes"*—revering as if before the divine, cherishing as one’s parents—all this is merely concentrating the spirit and gathering qi. Thus it is said: *"The Dao returns to nature."* The *Can Tong Qi* states: *"What nature does is not perverse conduct."* This is the meaning.

Master Qianxu’s *San Lun Tiao Xi Fa* states: Now, water unites with water, fire with fire, wind with wind, clouds with clouds—this is the constant principle. In regulating the breath, qi unites with qi—why force it? One need only concentrate the spirit into the qi cavern, letting the spirit’s light illuminate the yin heel vessel. Without expectation, they meet—this is the resonance of a single qi, naturally and spontaneously. The *Tun* hexagram says: *"The noble submits to the lowly, greatly gaining the people’s favor."* The *Xian* hexagram says: *"Cessation brings joy; the male submits to the female—thus there is free flow."* The *Book of Changes* has already spoken clearly of the way of union.

Yet the method of regulating the breath involves both technique and application; the alchemical path from beginning to end does not depart from it. The Master said: I discussed the seven reversions and nine refinements of the golden liquid great elixir with Hanxuzi. Hanxuzi replied: According to your words, these are all the wondrous functions of the medicinal spoon. Later, I saw Hanxuzi’s *Wu Ji Er Tu Pian*, which deeply accorded with the original intent, and so I recorded and transmitted it.

Those who seek to understand longevity cannot penetrate the numinous without this. Hanxuzi said: The *Wu Zhen Pian* states: *"If Kan and Li lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the four images, they cannot form the elixir. Only because each holds true earth does the golden elixir achieve reversion and return."* These four lines exhaust the marvels of harmonizing the elixir’s foundation.

For within fire, wood-mercury is born; within water, metal-lead is produced. Wood, fire, metal, and water contain the four images between Kan and Li. At this time, Li contains Ji, and Kan contains Wu—with the two earths as mediators, the four images may unite.

Some ask: Is true intention not earth? Earth has Wu and Ji—does this imply two intentions? It seems so, yet it is not. As intention, it is one; as earth, it is two. Taking one intention and dividing it into two yields the two earths, thus distinguishing inner and outer. Yet one must know movement and know stillness.

Originally, Wu earth is the external medicine, true yang within yin. Movement is primary, so one seizes Kan’s moment—only by detecting its movement. Knowing movement is intention; thus, the moment of knowing movement is one earth.

Ji earth is the internal medicine, true yin within yang. Stillness is primary, so after filling Li, one nurtures through stillness. Knowing stillness is intention; thus, the moment of knowing stillness is one earth. This one intention divides into two intentions, thereby acquiring the name of two earths. Yet when the two intentions merge into one, there is no longer any constraint of two earths, nor any fixation on inner or outer—only the capacity for both movement and stillness.

Originally, Ji earth is the internal elixir, yet it may transform into Wu earth: as the sun of Li reflects the moon of Kan, planting lead yields lead, and one sees only Wu without Ji—stillness enters into movement. Wu earth is the external elixir, yet it may shift into Ji earth: as the yang of Kan supplements the yin of Li, planting mercury yields mercury, and one sees only Ji without Wu—movement merges with stillness. These two intentions unite as one, unbound by the distinction of two earths.

Then do each of them harbor true earth, each holding one earth? Or do they together hold one earth? The perceptive and discerning will naturally understand.

The Dao of the golden elixir’s return cannot proceed without this true intention. Not only does it harmonize the four images, but it also commands them. Why? Within wood, fire is concealed; cast into the realm of water, fire ignites. Wood carries metal upward, mercury departs and returns. Fire, meeting metal, reverses its course. Within water, metal is born; refined by the work of fire, water boils. Metal follows wood upward, lead departs and returns. Metal, meeting fire, completes its cycle.

The art of metal and fire’s return is none other than the great elixir of seven reversals and nine returns. If one seeks the accomplishment of the great elixir, how can it be achieved apart from this true intention?

Master Ziyang said:
*"The red dragon and black tiger part east and west,
The four images intertwine within Wu and Ji."*

Immortal Tao observed:
*"The dragon emerges from fire, the green dragon transforms into the red dragon;
The tiger arises from water, the white tiger is renamed the black tiger."*
These four characters—*dragon, tiger, red, black*—already embody the four images.

*"Intertwine"* means to gather and cluster. In my humble view, those who practice elixir-making, desiring the four images to cluster, must ensure the five phases converge. The *"within Wu and Ji"* does not refer to the centers of Li and Kan, but rather to the central palace, the center. Though east and west are separated, the spatula unites them. Two substances transform into the four images; the four images coalesce into one village. One village assembles the five phases. When the five phases gather, the elixir congeals. Thus, the following lines state:
*"From this, Reunion and Encounter may be applied,
Who says the golden elixir cannot succeed?"*

Reunion and Encounter signify the fire tally of the tenth month. Advancing fire in Reunion, retreating the tally in Encounter, adjusting through addition and subtraction—naturally attaining the proper measure, the golden elixir may then be accomplished.

Elixir masters take *"Wu Ji"* as *"blade"* and *"two earths"* as *"spatula,"* structuring the characters to resemble their forms, precisely indicating the intent of forging and uniting. While the two earths as spatula are widely understood, *"Wu Ji"* as blade is less known.

Master Qianxu remarked: *"A scholar, grasping the meaning, interpreted the character '㇗' as the sound 'nie,' representing the top of 'Ji,' and '丿' as the sound 'pie,' representing the side of 'Wu.'"* Though lacking prior basis, this seems apt.

Master Hanxu countered: *"It is not without basis. In qin tablature, numbers are assembled to form a character, each stroke drawn from a single note. The method of plucking left and right is fully contained within one character—this is the very basis of qin tablature. '㇗' is the head of 'Ji,' '丿' is the side of 'Wu.' The two earths, Wu and Ji, are combined in the two characters 'blade' and 'spatula,' urging one to merge the two earths of Li’s Ji and Kan’s Wu into one place."*

Such is the nature of immortals’ veiled language.

*Imitating the Ancient* (after the *Cantong Qi*) states: *"I dare not speak idly, but emulate the writings of the ancients."* The title is taken from this.

The primordial ancestral qi,
Vague and dim, profound and still.
Originally formless, without trace,
At first a nameless, undivided whole.
When chaos first split open,
Taiyi sprouted forth in bud.
The Two Modes joined in virtue,
Sun and moon waxed and waned in light.
Qian intermingled with Kun’s transformations,
Kun sought Qian’s completion.
Different names yet one in origin,
A single root from which all springs.
Within and without, void and solid,
Hard and soft held in balance.
Yin and yang harmonized in governance,
Transforming and dividing into forms.
True essence, true qi,
Flickering and elusive in the void.
Kan and Li inverted,
The Five Phases set in motion.
When the *Jiji* gives birth to spirit,
The *Weiji* brings death’s approach.
The Dao of immortals is guarded with care,
The ghostly path inclines toward perversion.
Those who seek the Heavenly Dao
Swiftly shun the gates of ghosts.
From immortals aspiring to Heaven,
The Dao and qi endure forever.

**Again:**

The great Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Embraces harmony and holds the center.
The profoundest of the profound,
The subtlest of the subtle—its source.
Profound and subtle interpenetrate,
Splitting open the vast primeval mist.
The aperture’s bellows and key,
The Vermilion Bird scorches the sky.
The metal trigram’s moon appears,
In the southwest, a companion is found.
Laughing, they pour the dark wine,
Feasting within the Yellow Center.
The two eights achieve perfection,
Raven and hare blend as one.
The spirit’s radiance, silent and still,
The Yellow Elder within the imperial chamber.
The Xun wind stirs and blows,
The cauldron brims with crimson clouds.
Water and fire advance and retreat,
Dawn as *Zhun*, dusk as *Meng*.
Midnight and noon in motion,
Dawn and dusk yield no effect.
When the tenth month’s count is full,
The hexagrams’ images reverse and end.
The work of destiny complete,
Pure yang qi surges forth.
The subtle workings of spirit,
The Dao’s methods boundless.

These two chapters are commonly conflated into a single piece in popular editions, titled *"General Discussion on Internal and External Fire Timing in Golden Elixir"*—a practice I privately dispute. Later, upon obtaining Wang Xianzang’s edition, I felt a sudden clarity.

**The Heaven-Climbing Ladder**
A wanderer of the Great Yuan, drifting far,
Beard bristling like a halberd’s edge.
A single tune ascends the ladder to heaven,
Worth more than a flying staff of tin.
Recalling the first days of seeking the Dao,
My heart stood firm as unturned stone.
I resigned my post, roamed seas and peaks,
Toiling in search of the elixir’s secrets.
I bade farewell to my parents’ graves,
Leaving my homeland behind.
Parted from my middle-aged wife,
Stepping out as dawn broke white.
Abandoned my young children,
Turning from the burning house.
What others find hardest to complete,
This traveler has done.
What others find hardest to sever,
This traveler has cut away.
To witness the fruit of eternal life,
Soaring aloft on a crane’s back.
Postnatal nurturing strengthens,
Feet outpace the toil of service.
My heart stirs with longing,
As fleeting years slip like a galloping colt.
I crane my neck toward Zhongnan Mountain,
Sighing thrice to the heavens.
Heaven sent the Fire Dragon Master,
Whose deep, resonant voice—bold and measured—
Composed an ancient song, *"Reading the Moon."*
I pondered each word.
Knowing my inner elixir was formed,
I did not dwell on foundational work.
He bestowed upon me the outer elixir’s skill,
With earnest, tender instruction.
Refining the self, I forgot worldly cares,
Gathering the medicine in due season.
The prenatal has no weight,
The fire timing no hexagrams or strategies.
Only distinguish old from young,
Merely discern civil from martial.
Seek purely with true intent,
The *daogui* defies detailed explanation.
For ten months, embrace the primordial embryo,
For nine years, face the wall in meditation.
Exchange the cauldron to beget a new generation,
Ride the dragon to summon thunder.
Heaven and earth decay in time,
But the immortal elder’s life knows no end.

**The Master’s Oral Transmission**
The sacred master’s oral secrets,
A formula bequeathed through ages.
Passed to the people of this world,
How many truly comprehend?
A torn robe is mended with cloth,
A withered tree is nurtured with soil.
What can mend a person’s decay?
The mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.
Take the elixir from within *Kan*,
A golden flower blooms, one branch revealed.
Auspicious clouds unfold at heaven’s edge,
Propitious light fills the grave’s void.
Returning, I am dim and silent,
Like one drunk, like one entranced.
The great elixir, small as a millet grain,
Sheds its husk to dwell in effortless non-doing.
Roaming freely through heaven and earth’s expanse,
The myriad forms become a pearl in the palm.
If one can ingest this medicine,
Lifespan aligns with heaven and earth.
Should it fail to extend life,
My words are all falsehood.

**Reply to Emperor Yongle**
Heaven’s mechanism is not lightly disclosed,
Lest the present age lack ferocity.
Through a thousand trials, ten thousand hardships,
I now transmit it to the pulse of heaven and earth.
The emperor sought me to inquire of the golden elixir,
The patriarch left behind the secret of eternal life.
What is the secret of eternal life?
When Dao is full and virtue abundant, it is the true plan.
Curb desires, settle the mind, calm the spirit’s cares—
The immortal’s arts hold no other skill.

Below this is a five-character verse:
*"The golden elixir weighs one *jin*,
Close your eyes, silently preserve the spirit.
It is taken from within your home,
Why labor to seek it outside?
Refine the *Li* maiden’s mercury,
Swallow the *Kan* man’s essence whole.
Golden elixir and fire timing—
Each word is the primordial sound."*
This was written by Ancestor Lü,
Presented in reply to Emperor Yongle.

**Song of the Dao’s Sentiment**
The Dao’s sentiment is no ordinary feeling,
Once you grasp heaven’s mechanism, do not treat it lightly.
First, lay down all worldly concerns,
Then delve deeply into the principles.
Before refining the returning elixir, refine your nature,
Before cultivating the great medicine, cultivate your heart.
When the heart is cultivated, the elixir’s sign naturally arrives,
When the nature is purified, the medicinal materials naturally grow.
When medicinal materials grow, redouble your efforts,
Thunder rumbles faintly, shaking the empty void.
Where lightning flashes, seek the true seed,
When the wind’s signal comes, find the root source.
A myriad rays of rosy light envelop the golden cauldron,
A thousand *zhang* of purple clouds shroud heaven’s gate.
If you reach this point, do not be startled or afraid,
Steadily guard the cavern’s gate with your primordial spirit.
Like a cat seizing a mouse, a hare meeting a hawk,
Hasten your efforts, redouble your diligence.
All myriad phenomena are not of this kind—
A single speck of red light is the utmost truth.
This red light is the breath of spring,
Within it, as if dust on a bright window.
Suspended is a speck of prenatal medicine,
Distant as a grape, near as gold.
At this point, rely entirely on caution,
The slightest thought arising loses the celestial truth.
Wait for that speck to submit of itself,
Within your body, it transforms into the four seasons’ spring.
A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance,
Each rain’s passing brings renewal.
All day, languid as a drunkard,
Patiently awaiting the cavern’s spring.
The body’s yin essence is entirely stripped away,
Transformed into a lump of pure yang gold.
At this moment, breath ceases like a minor death,
Forged into a single piece—complete truth.
Only then is the work accomplished,
Then return to the dusty world to accumulate merit.
When merit is full and work complete, heaven’s decree arrives,
The yang spirit emerges, the true numen revealed.
These words must not be spoken to the unworthy,
Do not lightly discuss them with those who do not understand.
Within them lies the profound principle of penetrating the mysterious—
Beyond this truth, there is no truth.
Gather your belongings, seal them firmly,
One day, upon success, they may affirm your heart.
Affirm your heart—
Fifty-two lines for you to seek.
Should there be falsehood, heaven’s punishment will strike,
Speaking to the unworthy invites the lash that destroys the body!

**Song of Refining Lead**
Who understands the method of refining lead?
Attain this, and you become a true immortal.
I lamented my old age, finding no path,
Roaming the five lakes and three isles.
At sixty-seven, I entered Zhongnan,
Meeting a true person who transmitted the supreme treasure.
True lead arises before heaven and earth,
No need for metals, stones, plants, or herbs.
Refine it through eighty-one cycles, and if the work is complete,
Within the profound darkness, golden treasure is born.
A single golden bone stirs heaven and earth,
The two eights harmonize to generate a beautiful form.
Once the beautiful form is born, it dwells in the earthen cauldron,
You must, thought by thought, seal it firmly.
When the first yang fire arises, nurture it gently,
When the second yang fire arises, there is divine power.
If it reaches the *Tai* hexagram of the three yangs,
A roaring, fierce fire burns the empty void.
Retreat all yin talismans to generate the numinous essence,
Once the numinous essence is born, heaven and earth are complete.
Should there be any deficiency, harmonize again,
Return to the earthen cauldron to generate the numinous essence.

The full count of five thousand four hundred completes its measure,
Only then is the true marvel of refining lead exhausted.
I exhort those of like mind who come after:
Do not regard the refining of lead as easy.

*Song of the Primordial Qi*
Born as the primordial qi of pre-heaven,
It hides within the mountain of form, hard for men to encounter.
I clearly reveal it—you must remember:
A single string of spring water enfolds its configuration.
Draw it from the lower gate and swallow it through the mouth,
The twelve thunder gates all tremble in fear.
Drunk, ah! Drunk, ah! Once more drunk, ah!
The cinnabar field is suffused with spring, red as jade.
Freely drinking the fragrance of the nectar jar,
The wind of Xun stirs the primordial harmonious qi.
Yin demons are vanquished, a spring fills the breast,
Spirits wail and ghosts weep, heaven and earth overturn.
When merit is complete and the work fulfilled to three thousand,
One rides the phoenix and mounts the crane, ascending as an immortal.

*Song of Lead and Fire*
The great medicine arises at its appointed time,
At the *hai* hour, the beginning of *zi*, the fifth watch—hark!
Spirit and essence unite, merging their radiance,
In a state of vague indistinctness, a bright moon is born.
Once the union ceases, it flows downward in a bubbling stream,
The first yang returns—do not lightly release it.
Swiftly seal the Gate of Great Mystery,
Fire drives the medicine past the Weilu acupoint.
At the moment of gathering, use the eyes to guard the Niwan,
Lower the left and raise the right, then pause in stillness.
This is called "gazing at the principle, ascending the brain to the mysterious,"
Then lowering the right and raising it again in alternation.
When the count of six sixes is complete, the medicine matures,
Yang reaches its peak, yin arises, shifting to the right.
One must open the gate to withdraw the fire,
The gaze descends to guard the Kun field.
Right raised, left lowered, just then fixed in place,
The count of two eights completes one celestial cycle.
This is the true fire-phase of nature,
Naturally ascending and descending, spontaneously drawing and adding.

Neither crescent nor full moon, neither dark nor new,
No bathing rites nor lengthy scriptures remain.
Metaphors swept away, names cast aside—
Only these two lines hold the true essence.
*"Left and right"* should be read as *"before and after"*—
Take heed. Recorded by Sanfeng himself.

**Song of Realizing the Dao**
Spirit does not wander outward, essence does not leak,
Qi is not dissipated, the numinous sprout takes root.
The Five Phases and Four Images enter the Central Palace—
Why fear the golden elixir will not form itself?
Within, the true spirit; without, its response appears,
All around, empty blossoms descend like white snow.
At the return of the first yang, the hours of Hai and Zi converge,
Amidst them emerges a perfect full moon.
Hasten to apply effort and skill—
Gold at its fullest luster cannot be plucked.
Breath stirs the fire of the Mysterious Pass,
The azure sky splits, the primordial chaos cracks.
The Yellow River reverses its flow, ascending Kunlun,
The nine orifices and three barriers all open wide.
Transformed into jade nectar, it is swallowed into the belly—
A mute tasting honey, beyond words to tell.
At this stage of practice, be most vigilant,
Gather and bathe in accord with the seasons.
The two grades of yin and yang share the same nature,
Yet their inner and outer fire-tally differ.
The numinous medicine arrives in but a moment,
But its nurturing still requires ten months.
To mature further, pass another three years—
Three threes as nine, the elixir’s face turns away.
With the elixir complete, let out a long cry and depart the mountain,
Manifesting or concealing, leave traces of transformation.
The Celestial Emperor hears the name and sends down a purple writ,
Summoning me to ascend the heavens in azure flight.
Those who later diligently cultivate by this,
Become guests at the assembly of the Three Pure Ones.

**Song of Sitting in Meditation**
At first, when sitting, learn to contemplate Chan—
This subtle message lies in the Mysterious Pass.
Secretly, subtly, regulate the breath,
Within the cauldron, yin and yang refine.
Nature must be awakened, life transmitted—
Do not treat the fire-phase as trivial.
With eyes closed, observe the heart and guard the original destiny,
Purity and non-action are the root.
Within a hundred days, signs appear—
A single point in Kan rises upward.
The Yellow Dame acts as matchmaker,
Infant and maiden unite in perfect roundness.
The beauty is endless—who can it be told to?
The whole body, from head to toe, qi surges to the heavens.
Who knows this subtle message?
A mute dreaming, unable to speak.
Swiftly act, gather the primordial—
A speck of numinous medicine pierces the three barriers.
From the Elixir Field it ascends straight to the Niwan peak,
Descending past the heavy tower to the Great Central Origin.
Water and fire in harmony, true lead and mercury—
Without wu and ji, the elixir will not form.
The heart must die, life must be firm,
The radiance of spirit illuminates the three thousand worlds.
Beneath the shadowless tree, the golden rooster crows,
At midnight, the red lotus appears.
At the winter solstice, the first yang begins its return,
A thunderclap shakes the heavens.
The dragon calls, the tiger rejoices,
Immortal music resounds—no ordinary sound.
In the midst of the indistinct, preserve being and non-being,
Boundless transformations lie within.
Mysterious within the wondrous, wondrous within the mysterious,
The river chariot transports it past the three barriers.
Heaven and earth in harmony, the ten thousand things are born,
Daily drinking sweet dew, sweet as honey.
Immortal is Buddha, Buddha is immortal—
One nature, perfectly luminous, not two kinds.
The Three Teachings were originally one family:
Hungry, eat; tired, sleep.
Falsely burning incense, bowing in Chan—
How could they know the Great Dao lies before their eyes?
Deluded, they fast and miss the chance—
Once the human body is lost, ten thousand kalpas of difficulty follow.
Foolishly chasing the illusory path to the Western Heaven,
A blind man stumbling through the mountains at night.
The subtle mechanism is no trivial matter—
To leak the celestial secret is a crime as heavy as mountains.
Grasp the Four Upright Principles, contemplate with intent,
Break through the Mysterious Pass, wondrously penetrating the mysterious.
From Zi to Wu, Mao to You, the nights are unbroken—
Early seek a bright teacher to congeal the elixir.
One who recognizes true lead and mercury,
Becomes an immortal of ageless life.
Cultivate day by day, each day firm,
Do not view the practice with short-sighted eyes.
After three years and nine months, the work is accomplished,
Refining a single grain of the purple golden elixir.
Who composed this song?
The Immortal Sanfeng of Pure Emptiness.

**Song of the Dao’s Essential Secret**
The Dao’s song, the Dao’s song—
Without knowing the essentials, one is surely beset by demons.
Observe the Mysterious Pass, regulate the true breath—
Knowing these two essentials, cultivation is complete.
With the original spirit, enter the Sea of Qi,
When spirit and qi merge in silence, you attain the true sovereign of the first mystery.
With the original qi, enter the Yellow Court,
When qi and spirit harmonize in obscurity, you attain the most luminous of the second mystery.
One mystery is wondrous, one mystery is the aperture—
With desire, observe the aperture; without desire, observe the wondrous.
These two mysteries are the true mechanism—
Who knows they emerge from the same source under different names?
To observe the Mysterious Pass, there is no other secret—
First, within the aperture, regulate the true breath.
Spirit tranquil, qi still—utterly natural,
The wondrous arises from non-arising, the Supreme Ultimate appears.
The ancient immortals spoke sparingly,
Fearing the leakage of true secrets, they did not speak idly.
Some said it is fixed in the center,
Others said it is unfixed, to be grasped on one’s own.
Now, I speak it all—
It lies between the fixed and the unfixed.
Fixed is called the aperture, unfixed the wondrous—
What Laozi spoke of as "mysterious and again mysterious."
Pointing clearly, I ferry the sentient—
Leaving this for my disciples as a reward.
Those who encounter it but do not cultivate become lesser ghosts,
Whether saint or commoner depends on the person.
At the outset, practice is most difficult—
Departing from distraction, yet still sunk in torpor.
A true scholar, resolute in learning,
Must distinguish spirit and qi as pure and turbid.
The primordial spirit is most clear and luminous,
The postnatal spirit is but turbid matter.
Sweep away the turbid, guard the clear,
Seal the Three Treasures within the numinous valley.
This numinous valley is the aperture—
Within the aperture, regulate the breath with deep reflection.
One breath departs, one breath arrives,
Each breath interdependent, each moment close.
Subtly, silently, unnoticed by others,
Spirit and qi gather, surging through the nine orifices.
Practice thus to attain the aperture’s wondrousness—
Whence could torpor and distraction arise?
**Song of the Great Dao**
Now, lend your ears to my words—
The Dao has the primordial and the postnatal.
The postnatal dregs are of no use,
The primordial speck is called true lead.
To be ignorant of true lead, to lose one’s original nature—
This is the first illness in cultivation.

Within the Jade Clarity Hall, few tread the path—
I now reveal to you the immortal’s realm.
Life must be transmitted, nature must be awakened,
To ascend beyond the mortal lies within your grasp.
In stillness, awaken nature; in motion, gather the elixir—
Within, the tortoise and serpent coil in reverse.
At the stirring of the first yang, commence the work,
Vigorously turn the Celestial Gate.
Yin arises at noon within the yang of Kan,
At Mao and You, proceed with measured calm.
The Dipper’s handle turns the wheel toward the Purple Palace,
Laughing to welcome the guest, Master Yellow.
In the Yellow Dame’s chamber, meet the maiden of cinnabar—
The maiden and the infant naturally pair.
To lay the foundation, refine the self,
Refine it to purity, then clearly gather.
The mentor first guides me through a provisional practice:
First unseal the nine orifices by opening the gates.
The nine orifices originally lie at the Weilu point,
Begin by surging from the Yongquan beneath the feet.
From Yongquan, rise gradually to the knees,
Beneath the knees, the work demands great effort.
The Buddhists call this "reed sprouts,"
Like a crawling insect, like a piercing thorn.
Pass the knees, ascend slowly to Weilu,
Where a hard object seems to resist.
Only then proceed with all higher practices—
The three provisional stages hold their oral secrets.
Once the three passes burst open in a single strike,
Turn the flow upward to the Mud Pill Palace.
Pierce the Golden Lock Pass, descend the Magpie Bridge,
The Twelve-Storied Tower—how wondrous indeed!
The Twelve-Storied Tower is the Crimson Palace,
Within the Crimson Palace lies the Yellow Court, precise and true.
The Yellow Court must be refined to essence,
For within its center dwells a single spark of spirit.
Do not blindly obscure what is hidden—
The Yellow Court is the true Mysterious Pass.
If you fail to recognize the Mysterious Pass in its exact place,
Where will you lodge the true lead once gathered?

Have you not seen the *Awakening to Reality* poem?
"One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root."
When true essence returns, the golden void remains,
A single luminous pearl never parts from you.

Have you not seen the *Book of Concordance*?
Its likeness to Penglai is no false comparison.
"Below is closed, called the supreme closure of non-closure,"
The two apertures’ method requires qi’s mutual dependence.

From now on, when discoursing on the Dao or expounding on profound principles,
All else is but emptiness apart from this.
Once the passes are opened and the work accumulated,
Forging the sword demands discerning the true message.
Though Moye was wrought of iron,
How much truer is my sword, originally straight!
Heaven is the furnace, earth the forge,
Gold and water must balance—never act recklessly.
At Zi and Wu, practice to temper and complete,
To be hard or soft, to take or discard.
When the sword is whole, gather true lead,
Draw from the primordial chaos before separation.
If you gather only postnatal qi,
You merely prolong life, not transcend it.

At the second seven-hour mark, the true mechanism appears—
Seek it within the divine land of the Red Continent.
If both method and resources are obtained,
Reflect carefully to distinguish them well.
Rosy clouds, the hue of a pheasant,
Lips like cinnabar, skin as snow.
Wise and discerning, nature gentle and kind,
Eyes like lacquered pearls, hair pure black.
Qi refined, gaze steady, steps composed—
Only then calculate the years and months within.
Five thousand four hundred births yield the Yellow Path,
In profound obscurity, born of fleeting glimpses.
Follow the time to gather, determining rise and fall,
Not a hair’s breadth may be overstepped.
At this juncture, know the crescent moon’s third day,
The marvel lies in the west, in the white of Geng and Xin.
The sword of wisdom sharp, the heart sincere,
Strike the bamboo to resonate, then pluck the zither.
The Heavenly Ladder is indispensable—
Who can fathom such subtle, hidden mechanisms?
Do not recklessly angle for the giant turtle in the sea’s depths,
Lest you startle it away, never to return.

Guard the furnace without harm, distinguish the timing with care,
After gathering the postnatal, merely extend the years.
One double-hour divides into six watches,
The golden elixir forms within two.
The remaining four watches hold divine work—
The marvel lies in heart-transmission, not to be divulged.

When true lead arrives, ignite the spirit-fire,
From west to east, first seek me.
Move my true mercury, a single red speck,
To welcome and meet, forming one pearl.
Pass the three passes, ascend to the Mud Pill Palace,
Descend the Twelve-Storied Tower into the Broad Cold.
Neither foolish nor wise,
Neither sober nor drunk.
Were it not for expending spirit throughout the body,
How could husband and wife unite as one?

When the elixir is settled, the heart rejoices,
The hexagrams *Tun* and *Meng* respond at dawn and dusk.
Know that bathing lies within,
At Mao and You, do not advance.
Guard the city walls, cease the martial work,
The numinous cinnabar fills the crucible, crimson.
Thus, after ten months, the work is complete,
The vessel, the elixir chamber—all emptied in an instant.

Enter the deep mountains, embrace the One,
All things voided, no effort spent.
Cold, heat, hunger, toil cannot assail,
For nine towering years, face the wall.
From the Northern Sea at dawn to Yingzhou at dusk,
Suddenly, when merit and practice are fulfilled,
The Three Officials of the Water Palace tally the years,
A sealed elixir missive descends from the Jade Heaven.
Green luan and white crane dance in flight,
Until the final investiture in the Illuminated Realm,
Forever becoming an immortal, ageless and undying.

**Song of the True Bellows and Key**
Speak not of the Great Dao as effortless action—
What is this toying with bellows and key in the chamber?
When desire stirs, not a moment’s rest,
Purple qi and red light scatter in brilliance.
The Azure Dragon delights, the White Tiger despises,
The Azure Dragon coils around the tortoise shell.
Two streams of true qi pierce the Heavenly Palace,
Decisively ascending to the Three Clarities Pavilion.
Within the pavilion, a jade pool is clearly seen,
Holding the medicine of immortality.
Follow the time to gather and take it,
Consume it to enjoy Penglai’s bliss.

**Song of the Mysterious Pass**
The Mysterious Pass, a single aperture, holds the true secret,
As Qian and Kun split open, Penglai’s expanse unfolds.
Within the Yellow Court dwells an original elder,
Holding the zither, awaiting the moon at heaven’s edge.
The second water is clear, the third water turbid,
Golden flowers bloom, the Dui trigram’s head wanes.
On Mount Emei, purple mist soars,
The mist transforms, melting the red furnace’s snow.
The dragon’s chant compels, the tiger’s roar presses,
The numinous tortoise drinks the Golden Crow’s blood.
Riding the dragon, sword at the waist, drunk I return home,
Turning the three passes to face the Northern Palace.

**Song of Refining Lead**
The Supreme Dao, proclaimed anew,
Distinguishes the prenatal from the postnatal.
It speaks only of lead born after Gui,
Not of yang arising before Gui.
Rein in the intent-horse, lock the mind-ape,
Without stray thoughts, the mind must be single-minded.

Cut away the three poisons—greed, wrath, and delusion—until they perish,
Root out the five thieves—lust and desire—until they lie hidden no more.
The Flowery Pond’s water, the Upper Valley’s spring,
The ancients used these to moisten the Three Fields.
Should you know the medicine that returns to the root and extends the years,
You must refine the Returned Elixir, the life-renewing lead.
Forth from the Northern Sea, coursing through the Western River,
Wielding the craftsman’s hand, plant the golden lotus.
Capture alive the tiger’s marrow to temper in the furnace,
Seize the living tortoise’s essence to simmer in the cauldron.
Prenatal qi, primordial mist,
A single draught of ghee preserves the countenance.
Once attained, let cold and heat transform as they will,
Consuming it, you leap beyond the gate of life and death.

Seek the first scripture, trace the new moon’s arc,
I now reveal the wondrous within the wondrous.
When water and fire achieve balance in a single union,
Yin and yang converge in three thousand cycles.
Reaching the other shore, no boat is needed,
Extinguish thought, dissolve emotion, sever false ties.
In stillness and clarity, behold the treasure of life,
In dimness and silence, guard the embryonic immortal.
Endure hardship for two or three years,
The yang spirit emerges, sacred work complete.
Tending the fire without mishap, mastering creation,
You live long without aging, your lifespan equal to heaven’s.

**Song of the Golden Elixir**
A single grain of golden elixir weighs one *jin*,
Those who know it attain everlasting life.
Lay the foundation, sweep away worldly affairs,
Refine the self, only to nurture the original spirit.
The Yellow Court’s earthen crucible, the prenatal mercury,
All cares vanish, worldly passions cease.
Departing from the self is not the Dao,
Clinging to the self is also void.

I now disclose the celestial mechanism’s principle,
Revealing it to all heroic seekers of the Dao.
Before your eyes lies the path to longevity,
Yet countless mortals remain deluded about their original nature.
Sweep the spirit-terrace clean of every thought,
In tranquil leisure, enact the mysterious work.
Breathing in emptiness, the spirit guards its abode,
The hundred channels return to the source, clear as water.
Within the body, true lead manifests,
A single crimson radiance, bright as the moon.
The Mysterious Pass comes and goes without fixed place,
Yin and yang ascend and descend in their appointed hours.
Within the year, take from the month; within the month, take from the day,
At mid-autumn, the moon’s orb appears.
For thirty days, remain seated at home,
Never straying from the Purple Tenuity’s star.
Facing south, observe the Northern Dipper’s handle,
Just as noon strikes the third watch.
In the northwest, install the furnace to refine the numinous medicine,
In the southeast, erect the tripod to enact the divine work.
Tripod and furnace face each other, true hands at work,
The wisdom sword hangs in the Crystal Palace.
The Yellow Dame beckons as matchmaker,
The numinous tortoise enters the furnace, ever deeper.
Ghee pours upon the crown, the true bellows’ key,
Gathering the prenatal qi in its purity.
One breath, one twist at the Celestial Valley’s point,
The river chariot transports it up Kunlun’s peak.
Crossing the Magpie Bridge, it enters the Flowery Pond,
Descending the twelve-story tower of the Double Loft.
Passing the tailbone, spine, and the three passes,
The Metal Lord returns to its abode in the Yellow Court.
Lead seeks mercury like a cat hunting a mouse,
Mercury pursues lead as a rabbit flees the hawk.
Nine revolutions of the divine elixir enter the golden tripod,
Ten months of gestation complete the work of creation.
Unaware of cold or heat, true creation unfolds,
The body transforms into pure yang, true gold.
Accumulate three thousand deeds of merit in the world of dust,
Ascend at daylight to pay homage in the Jade Capital.

**Song of the Returned Elixir Breaking Delusion**
The Returned Elixir’s secret, the Returned Elixir’s secret,
I now explain it to you in careful detail.
Three thousand side paths of minor arts,
Apart from this golden elixir, all are crooked ways.
All manner of dross and base matter are of no small account,
Only true yin and true yang are rightly grafted.
When yin and yang unite, lead and mercury join,
Infant and maiden blaze in the empty sky.
Dragon and tiger ascend and descend in spiraling flight,
The numinous tortoise at the sea’s bottom plays with stars and moon.
The long yellow sprout, the flying white snow,
The golden dew in water—this is the prenatal secret.
The true Yellow Dame, the true bellows’ key,
The golden elixir is the medicine of immortality.
First lay the foundation, then introduce the medicine,
A hundred days’ effort firmly grasped.
If you guide the two qi back to the Yellow Path,
The three families meet, the immortal embryo forms.
Refine the nature, join the life,
Do not waste months and years among mortals.
If you return lead and mercury to true earth,
Adding mercury and refining lead, they never perish.
The crow’s eight ounces, the hare’s half-*jin*,
These two enter the village of Wu and Ji.
Martial at both ends, civil in the center,
The four images captured and cooked in one vessel.
Ten months of diligent work, the fire’s timing perfect,
Pure yang refined, life without end.
Transfer the tripod, shift the embryo for three to five years,
Nine years facing the wall, the yang spirit emerges.
Mysterious is the ancestor, the female is the origin,
Prenatal and pre-earth, the root of all things.
Point and open the eye that pierces earth and heaven,
Turn the celestial pivot, the Dipper moves in reverse.
Open the aperture, qi flows of itself,
The thunder revolves the Dipper’s handle, its sound roaring.
Clouds drawn from the sea’s bottom, the dragon churns waves,
Wind stirs in the muddy pellet, the tiger’s roar resounds.
If you master the method of inverting yin and yang,
The creation of heaven and earth is accomplished in an instant.

Expound the *Awakening to Reality*, discuss the *Uniting the Three*,
This principle was originally one and the same.
Though this medicine is obtained from the chamber of love,
The great medicine of the golden elixir is not the same.
Though you refine qi, though you refine essence in vain,
Seal the tailbone, yearn for ascension,
Without the golden elixir, all is futile.
Beasts and birds know how to preserve their horns and antlers,
The tortoise draws breath through its nose to regulate qi,
The deer circulates qi through its tailbone to refine essence.
The crane’s embryo is ever steadfast,
By night it companions clouds and pines, quietly nurturing spirit.
Beasts may live a thousand years,
Yet humans fail to awaken to longevity.
Throughout the world, people covet fame and profit,
Unafraid of Yama’s ledger of sins.
Humans are born and die, beasts perish,
When the three-inch breath severs, ghosts become neighbors.

The prenatal medicine, the postnatal medicine,
These are the true wondrous substances of yin and yang.
The prenatal medicine can transcend,
The postnatal medicine extends the life of the shell.
If mortals grasp the mechanism of grafting,
They attain great enlightenment and never die.
Refine the nature, perfect the life,
Gather the prenatal to plant in the muddy pellet.
The youth refines, essence and qi complete,
In stillness, a single qi can ascend to heaven.
Only the formless body remains unbroken,
This is the Great Luo Immortal of true cultivation.
In youth, original yang is lost,
Midway through life, one leaves home, the nature wild and reckless.
The yang line flees into the yin lines of the Kun trigram,
Transforming into the Li trigram, hollow and stretched.
Take the solid center from the Kan trigram’s position,
Return to the root, revert to yang, restore the original.

True water and fire pair with yin and yang,
Let mortals not indulge in reckless speculation.
Though you sit in emptiness through non-action,
You cannot escape death to be buried in Beimang.

Practicing stillness, guarding the Central Yellow,
To old age, all differences are but vain effort.
Even if you comprehend the true suchness of nature,
The yin po will reincarnate into the realm of ghosts.

The elixir of life, the nectar of returning soul,
The Golden Elixir is the king among medicines.
If you swallow but a single grain into your belly,
You reverse aging, regain youth, and live long.

Neither abandon your wife nor forsake grain,
Hold fast to the fast, expound the Dharma, journey west.
Though you master myriad heterodox methods,
Apart from this same kind, all are but madness.

I have revealed all the celestial mechanisms,
The Returned Elixir is truly the immortal’s recipe.
Generations of immortals hence attain this,
Transcending the mortal world to ascend to heaven.

I exhort later Dao seekers,
Do not heed the false masters’ short and long.
If you obtain the oral formula of the Golden Elixir,
You extend years, abide in the world, and live boundlessly.

By this cultivation, forge the path of longevity,
Repay the master’s kindness, give thanks to heaven.
Hold fast to this formula, make it a vessel of compassion,
When merit is complete and work perfected, move the Jade Emperor.

Who crafted the Golden Liquid to break delusion?
For ten thousand ages, it has flowed through Yuanhua Zhang.

*Dragon-Tiger Returned Elixir: Song of Pointing to Delusion*

Though you inquire everywhere for the immortal’s ladder,
Only at the first stirring of yang does it become wondrous.
Water submerges Kunlun, the azure sea churns,
The tiger’s roar on the cliff is the ancestral foundation.

A direct pointer to the carefree, swift method:
A bright moon illuminates Mount Sumeru.
The tiger in water, the dragon in fire,
Within the Eight Trigrams and Five Phases, they manifest brilliance.

Seize the dragon, and purple mist arises,
Subdue the tiger, and golden flower dew appears.
How do these two images establish the root of the Dao?
Only because the path of Caoxi has long been borrowed.

Male pairs with female, yin pairs with yang,
Their union is a clear battle.
Wu-ji earth serves as the Yellow Chamber,
When spirit and qi are pure, it is the Medicine King.

Refine the grain of Purple Gold Elixir,
Ride the crane, mount the phoenix, and pay homage to the Jade Emperor.

---

The tiger hides in the azure sea, sleeping with the child,
The dragon circles above Fusang in the sunlight.
Wait until the yang of spring stirs,
The tiger emits golden light, the dragon spits saliva.

A sword at the waist gathers the dragon’s mist,
When the dragon returns, the tiger naturally retreats with it.
The two follow each other into wu-ji,
A furnace of true fire slowly simmers.

From midnight to year’s end, the fire timing is strict,
At mao and you, be vigilant, do not idle.
Swallow the ancestral qi, the jade nectar,
Who can fathom the true emptiness within form!

Refinement lies only in the place of one’s birth,
The Ten Kings of the Underworld share this method.
Swiftly awaken, do not be foolishly greedy,
Do not dismiss the old man’s words as heresy.

Though you expound the Three Treasuries’ Dharma,
Without awakening to non-arising, it is all in vain.
Break through this iron steamed bun,
And you shall be carefree and at ease for millions of years.

*Annotations on the Nine August Elixir Scripture: Third Month, Generating the Hun Soul—Golden Elixir’s Three Returns, One Reversion Song*

Month by month,
All are the true essence and blood within the young lotus.
No need to set up furnace or tripod,
Only employ non-action to draw it through.

Nor wait for the qi of the two crescents,
Wait only for the star palace between the brows.
Nor wait for eight taels or half a catty as the living child,
Wait only for the exact five thousand four hundred of the proper month.

No need for spirit to commune across bodily separation,
Only use the upward exhale and downward inhale of the two ○.
First, the whole body warms,
Second, the fontanel opens,
Third, the celestial eye opens, and you see the great thousand worlds.
At this point of efficacy, it is truly
The generation of the womb, the birth of the embryo, the arising of the hun soul.

I instruct the Dao-cultivating disciples:
You must ride the crane amidst the clouds,
Never be buried in the sands and dust.

---

*Annotations on the Nine August Elixir Scripture: Fourth Month, Generating the Po Soul—Golden Elixir’s Four Returns, Two Reversions Song*

The Old Ancestor is named the Demon-Quelling Protector of the Dao,
Penetrating the seven po to restrain them at you.
Within you lies true gold,
Gold can preserve longevity.
The imperial true po, the life’s origin,
From this, the wondrous primordial origin arises.

On the wedding night of the bridal chamber,
Forget passion amidst the circumstances.
*Tali, moli, jinzha, muzha, tuonam, om,*
*Like me, like me,*
*Namo prajñāpāramitāye.*

---

*Annotations on the Nine August Elixir Scripture: Seventh Month, Opening the Heart and Seven Orifices—Golden Elixir’s Seven Returns, Five Reversions Song*

The Dao Lord sits in the Great Tenuity,
Descending to give birth to the Great Heavenly Honored One.
Bestowing these true Dharma words,
Guiding people to ascend to Jade Purity.

A single-character formula,
Seven months as its symbolic form.
Two on the left, three on the right, called five,
The Supreme Ultimate is naturally imbued with the five numina.

Only when the five numina attain it do the seven orifices open,
You must move the celestial eye to come here.
Those who truly cultivate the Dao,
Break through the mechanism to ascend the jade terrace.

---

*Annotations on the Nine August Elixir Scripture: Tenth Month, Firmness of Form and Spirit—Golden Elixir’s Ten Returns Song*

The Immortal Girl Nongyu plays her jade flute,
Each note blowing into the primordial orifice.
This orifice is called the root of heaven and earth,
When the prenatal is sufficient, the hundred scenes naturally give birth to spirit.

The eight scenes generate the twenty-four heavens,
The nine orifices naturally open to the numinous.
The sacred embryo originally borrows the true qi,
The Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool floats golden liquid,
The heart of the lotus.

Heart after heart aligns with the yellow sprout,
Fragrance arises within the brocade universe.
Seizing the true fragrance’s wondrous mist,
It preserves me for kalpas, ever abiding.

Ever since the Pure Yang Patriarch revealed this,
Wise men of ten thousand generations have used it with care.
On Penglai Isle, leave your name,
At Yingzhou Assembly, emulate Lord Xu,
In broad daylight, uplift your dwelling and ascend.

Three years today, earnestly exhorting:
May all people possess longevity,
Yang unites with the primordial root.

---

*Song of Securing the Leak*

Speak of the mysterious, discourse on the mysterious,
Move the spirit, turn the nine orifices,
The three passes and eight gates all topple.
Close the Yellow Chamber, refine the elixir furnace,
Do not let the six thieves come to clamor.

The master laughs *ha-ha*,
Guarding the Yellow Court, proud and aloof.
The infant comes, the old woman calls,
The two households unite in wondrous mystery.

The Golden Elixir is cradled in the embrace,
The whole body radiates a haze of light.
Seated in the cinnabar field, called the Pure Void,
Purple qi and red light ever shine.

Ascend to the summit of Mount Sumeru, the Niwan Palace,
Descend to the Yongquan point, penetrating the profound mysteries.
Within the Seven Treasures Pool, steal the treasures away,
Discard all impure essence and杂 qi.

Jade branches and golden blossoms, fresh as new,
Crafted from coral and agate, chariots of carnelian.
Secure the leaking body, seal the leaking orifices,
The unyielding cauldron firmly secures all leaks.
The Twelve-Storied Tower opens wide,
The seven meridians and eight vessels unite with the Triple Burner,
All bones and limbs bear witness to the effect.

The large intestine encircles, the small intestine gleams,
Above and below, the Magpie Bridge stands steady and sure.
Cross the Zhaozhou Bridge to drink tea,
By the Sweet River, listen to voices call.
The great circulation flows, the small circulation arrives,
The three families meet in shared joy.
I fortify this leaking body,
For ten thousand years and a thousand autumns, free from age.

Refine the corporeal form into the Great Yang,
Essence, qi, and spirit complete, guard the Central Yellow.
Lead and mercury simmered into the supreme treasure,
A single grain of Golden Elixir radiates its light.
The Infant manifests, ever-present,
Attaining longevity equal to Heaven, escaping impermanence.

Whoever masters the *Song of Securing the Leak*
Holds the very method for eternal youth.

*Song of Realizing the Dao*

A worm in the mundane world,
Drifting through the mortal realm,
All day adrift, with no recourse.
The true apertures, none understand,
Yet once found, the true gate lies therein.

Seek no one’s favor, nor their love,
No one’s disdain, nor their reproach.
No meditation, no prostrations,
No seated practice, no lazy precepts.
Roam the ends of the earth, behold the world,
When wine is met, drink a few cups,
When meat is met, eat a few bites.
Beg a bowl of rice, fill the belly,
Find a scrap of cloth, cover the four great elements.
A broken house? Build it yourself.
The master within must be at peace.

Enter not the arena of fame and gain,
Care not for success or failure,
Owe no taxes to the state,
Incure no debts to children.
If others seek me, I remain unattached.

At dawn, wander by the five lakes,
At dusk, lodge within the green mountains.
A boulder for a pillow,
The blue sky as a blanket.
Tigers and leopards dare not intrude,
Demons and monsters dare not harm.
Unaware, sleep until the sun glows red,
Free from fear, shock, or dread.

From now on, shatter the gate of right and wrong,
Leap free from the red dust beyond.
Clap hands, slap thighs, laugh *he-he*,
At ease, at ease—truly at ease.

---

*Palindrome Poem*

By the bridge, the courtyard faces the willow-lined bay,
In the bright moonlight, half the door stands ajar.
From afar, the crane returns late to the cave,
Quietly strumming the lute, seated with idle clouds.
Seeking fire for the elixir, the stove is never empty,
Gathering herbs for immortality, the mountains are fair.
The gourd hangs high on the tree, the recluse long hidden,
Far from the clamor, the waters murmur softly.

*Thirty-Six Poems on the Golden Elixir*

**Nurturing the Dao, Returning to the True**

For decades, adrift on rivers and lakes,
Meeting the master, I bit through the iron steamed bun.
Who prepares the sweetest nectar?
The midnight lamp’s oil may yet suffice!
Trust the Dao—form and spirit enter the wondrous,
Only then know life and nature must be fully cultivated.
Once a glimpse is grasped,
Forget the world’s ten thousand bushels of sorrow.

**Leaving the Dust, Returning to Seclusion**

A heart at leisure, free from worldly dust,
In the realm’s stillness, nurture the spirit.
The plain lute plucks the moon from the sky’s edge,
The dark wine drains the spring from the jar’s depths.
The five qi ascend to the origin with the sun’s growth,
The three flowers gather at the crown, ever renewed.
Refining the great medicine, transcend the ordinary,
Carefully inscribe poems to warn those who follow.

**Sweeping the Realm, Cultivating the Mind**

The inner and outer scenes weave like hemp,
Yet there is ground for boasting in one’s pursuits.
Let go—no delusion, the true shortcut,
Turn back, reflect—this is my home.
The six roots purified, without obstruction,
The five aggregates empty, without blemish.
Utterly forgotten, the heart’s square inch grows still,
A bright moon illuminates the Southern Flower.

**Overcoming the Sleep Demon**

Drowsy qi and slumber bring no light harm,
At the first watch, weariness arises.
There must be something—ever vigilant,
Only the heart must stay sharply awake.
Though the body may seem drunk with thoughts,
Rouse the spirit, sit until dawn.
With this one whip, awaken fiercely—
What endeavor cannot be achieved?

**Seeking the Mysterious Pass I**

A single aperture, the Mysterious Pass, the road’s head,
Neither heart nor kidney, most profound and secluded.
Searching the bladder and perineum is labor in vain,
The spleen, stomach, and Niwan Palace—seek not at random.
The root of spirit and qi ever flickers,
Within the cavern of emptiness, explore carefully.
It turns out to be but the place of numinous clarity,
Nurture the Returned Elixir, ride the crane in flight.

**Seeking the Mysterious Pass II**

The puppet on stage nods its head,
Know that all is pulled by strings.
Though pulled by another’s power,
Who pulls me? Who schemes?
Rely on the master’s constant moonlight,
Ensure every place is graced with fine elegance.
If refining the elixir requires the winter solstice,
Seek it within the stillness of the numinous terrace.

**On the Mysterious Pass in General**

The body itself is Heaven and Earth—seek not without,
The aperture of empty numinosity is most profound.
Two or three may be permitted as companions,
One or four may join as peers.
The five earths build the center, governing growth,
Where the Xun wind rises, hardness and softness are determined.
Once the wondrous return to the origin is known,
Within the six-six palace, spring and autumn recur.

**Forging the Spirit Sword**

The master transmits the method of forging the green serpent,
In the Kun crucible and Qian furnace, it is tempered and refined.
Neither iron nor gold, yet brimming with life and death,
Formless and shadowless, it moves with numinous power.
Drawn from the scabbard, Heaven and Earth grow narrow,
Sheathed in the breast, a mustard seed swells.
Though ten thousand taels of gold cannot find it,
It lurks by the body, slaying demons unseen.

**Postnatal Foundation-Building**

Qi depleted, blood weakened—time to replenish,
The enlightened master imparts the oral formula.
Jade fluid from the Flower Pool, swallow with the hours,
Peach Grove’s nectar, sip with the days.
Abandon thoughts, forget concerns—return to the child’s heart,
Return to the root, restore life—this is the immortal’s work.
The cinnabar field grows warm, the face regains youth,
Mocking those who cling to empty heads white as snow.

**Postnatal Refinement of the Self**

Who knows the work of refining the self?
The essence-spirit ever attends me.
Not a speck of dust stains the heart—utter stillness,
Ten thousand cares forgotten—the nature grows dull.
No thieves of the perverse can invade the inner realm,
The disciple serves the stern master all day.
When hungry, drink the wine of immortality,
Daily drunk, muddled as mud.

**Obtaining the Medicine Through Self-Refinement**

Refinement of the self follows the foundation’s completion,
Ten thousand cares at heart already forgotten.
A wheel of moonlight serves as companion,
The thunder’s roar at midnight known alone.
Snowflakes in stillness scatter white specks,
Sprouts from emptiness grow golden branches.
Seizing the primal yang’s returning essence,
A thousand-year-old crane-rider is conceived.

**Commencing Self-Refinement**

Body apart yet spirit conjoined—the principle is clear,
Two counterparts must align in practice.
Set the furnace, erect the crucible, seek the true seed,
Face the world yet forget emotion, recognize the native land.
Seize the dragon’s head to gather the purple mist,
Split the tiger’s tail to reveal golden light.
A speck of true lead swallowed into the belly,
All things shine bright, life endures long.

**The Primal Crucible**

Once the primordial aperture is discerned,
The crucible of heaven and earth is recognized.
No need for spiritual effort to regulate water and fire,
The numinous qi naturally permeates skin and flesh.
Morning by morning, the yellow crane nests in the golden tripod,
Night by night, the silver toad pours into the jade flask.
To grasp the truth of the golden elixir,
Cultivate where the body has yet to form.

**The Primal True Lead**

The world abounds with those who love the mysterious,
Yet few know this primal lead.
Within five thousand days, the yellow path is born,
In thirty hours, the black lead is recognized.
Not after heaven and earth divided,
But before father and mother conceived.
Such a supreme treasure exists in every household,
Only the foolish fail to see it clearly.

**The Primal Great Medicine**

Believe in the golden elixir—its principle is most refined,
Few understand this primal speck.
It belongs to all, rich or poor,
And grows in every being, wise or foolish.
Swallowed into the belly, it quickens with life,
Held in the palm, it vanishes without form.
If the world asks me, I cannot answer,
But point afar to the moon rising at *geng*.

**Seizing the Primal**

I smile to see the wondrous mystery in the divine land,
Whispered secrets passed ear to ear.
Split open chaos to seek gold and mercury,
Cleave the primordial to grasp the watery lead.
A grain of millet holds the northern sea,
The toad’s light illumines ten thousand paths in the west.
Should one gather and swallow it,
How could a mortal not become immortal?

**Coalescing the Primal**

Once the golden elixir is known, act swiftly,
Its marvel lies in the subtle and minute.
A speck of true lead stirs at the female gate,
The three families’ foundation lies in the mysterious chamber.
Coalescing in the cinnabar field, jade leaves grow,
Returned to the earthen crucible, immortal fungi flourish.
To fathom the primal principle,
Recognize the red flower atop the black turtle.

**Recognizing and Gathering the Medicine**

The sun at sea’s bottom, the moon atop the mountain,
At the assembly on Spirit Mountain, seek the eggplant’s hue.
Flowers bloom, birds sing—spring fills the sky,
Inverted, dragon’s saliva pairs with tiger’s blood.
Divine radiance pierces the jade flask’s field,
The secret tally follows *kun*, *shen*, *zi*, and *wu*.
A hundred days of the knife’s measure—great elixir complete,
Elixir complete, one becomes a dweller of Penglai.

**Direct Indication of True Lead**

True lead is the flower within the moon,
West and north engender each other, one family.
Within the female lies the male—a supreme treasure,
From black emerges white, the numinous sprout appears.
Gold abundant, water scarce—this is precious,
Yin flourishing, yang weak—nothing to boast.
Know too that it contains *wu* earth,
Ever the furnace’s fire stirs cinnabar.

**Direct Indication of True Mercury**

True mercury is the essence within the sun,
East three, south two—white engenders white.
Fire hidden in wood is no idle tale,
The male harbors the female—a precious treasure.
Let not a trace of yin’s impurity taint it,
Ensure the whole body shines with the great yang.
Within it, *ji* earth nurtures the primordial qi,
Refining the numinous sprout to gradual growth.

**Lead and Mercury Conjoined**

True lead and true mercury unite,
Sticky as lacquer, inseparable in intent.
Mercury poured into lead is like bathing the sun,
Lead tempering mercury is like adding oil.
Lead harmonizes mercury’s nature, ever companion,
Mercury delights in lead’s affection, joyfully swimming.
The five phases within and without gather in array,
Forming the red-and-white head of the great elixir.

**The Wondrous Inversion**

Seeking truth and visiting the Dao—what difficulty?
Only that one’s heart must know inversion.
Do not seek the supreme medicine in mountains and forests,
But find true lead within the city.
The green dragon locks *li* and *kan* in embrace,
The white tiger draws *dui* into *qian*.
This art, once set in motion,
Naturally ascends against heaven’s path.

**Harmonizing the Elixir’s Head**

Once the yellow path is born, the sprout begins,
True yang must return in due season.
The samadhi fire issues from *li*,
A thunderclap resounds from *zhen*.
Qi and spirit harmonize to nurture the numinous essence,
Heart and life interdepend to form the sacred embryo.
Once the inner message is grasped,
The three passes and nine apertures open at once.

**The Three Families Meet**

Summon the yellow matron to act as matchmaker,
From nothing, something is nurtured and grown.
Yet it was the serpent girl who waited then,
Luring the young lord from without.
The two apertures communicate without barrier,
The chambers of time and palace meet undivided.
Harmoniously joined, boundless potential,
A child is born—the sacred embryo.

**The Ninefold Great Return**

The ninefold returning elixir begins with practice,
Know that the spring emerges from the mountain’s base.
Set the furnace’s wondrous use upon *kun* earth,
The fire’s work relies on *xun* wind.
*Dui* tiger and *zhen* dragon blend,
*Kan* man and *li* woman harmonize.
Once the four images return to center,
The mechanism of creation rests in my body.

**The Subtlety of Fire Timing**

Years, months, days, hours—gathered in a moment,
A moment’s lapse parts yin and yang.
Withdraw and add according to the hare and rooster’s advent,
The work of ascent and descent—dragon and tiger fierce.
Guard against danger, cease the fire’s work,
Weigh grains and scruples, align with the hexagrams.
Naturally, the count completes the celestial cycle,
Day by day, thus practiced for ten months.

**Spiritual Transformation After Birth**

Elixir complete, my life obeys no heaven,
Mountains and valleys may shift as they will.
Honor and disgrace touch me not—I delight everywhere,
Profit and fame hang not—I follow the moment’s whim.
I know only the scene within the gourd’s heaven and earth,
Who recalls the mortal world’s cyclical years?
Should you ask where my trace returns,
Drunk, I point afar to the edge of white clouds.

**Nine Years Facing the Wall**

Nine years facing the wall, nurturing the spirit’s form,
Silent and dim, as in self-refinement.
Unbound, unconstrained—freedom attained,
Following conditions, knowing when to cease.
The heart shines with the sun and moon’s great radiance,
I and heaven-and-earth stand as inner and outer.

**Shattering the Void**

Shattering the void is no trifling matter,
Gathering the six directions into a millet grain.

**Exchanging the Cauldron and Dividing the Embryo**
Reinstalling the furnace and cauldron, establishing Kun and Qian,
With skillful hands, the elixir is moved into the upper field.
Virtue exalted, the spirit advances further,
The void pulverized, the method boundless.
From now on, the discarded returns to form,
Hereafter, the divided embryo enters the mystery again.
Children nurture grandchildren, grandchildren nurture sons,
Old man and old woman ascend as immortals together.

**Transforming the Mechanism to Communicate with the Spirit**
Nurturing the great-grandchild until gradually grown,
A flourishing lineage surpasses ancestors with wise planning.
Last night by lamplight, a fine match was made,
Today in the hall, a brilliant hero is born.
Each child stands like a jade tree,
Their immortal descendants cluster like golden stalks.
A company surpassing linked jade disks,
Tax-free fertile fields tilled only by oneself.

**Ninefold Spiritual Transformation**
Ninefold cinnabar elixir, years deep,
Nurturing the relic that ghosts and gods revere.
A furnace of white snow, pure as jade,
A cauldron of yellow sprouts, finer than gold.
Once seen, phoenixes dance with simurghs,
Behold tigers roaring and dragons chanting.
The five metals and eight stones all become treasures,
Refining the celestial origin to ascend with one’s dwelling.

**Cultivating the Celestial Origin**
Who knows the grade of the celestial elixir?
Born from non-being, rare in the world.
Heaven and earth as the furnace, true creation,
Yin and yang as the medicine, naturally subtle.
The chicken that eats becomes a crane, soaring through blue clouds,
The dog that feeds becomes a dragon, flying in broad daylight.
Only here is the ultimate in loftiness and wonder,
Permitting you to join hands and return together.

**Carefree and Unfettered**
The Daoist has long since stilled ears and eyes,
Carefree and unconstrained, free from bonds.
At dawn, rising with the sun at Fusang,
At dusk, lodging at the cloud’s edge on Kunlun.
How many years since the blue ox crossed the pass?
This Dao lies clearly before one’s eyes.
Last night, after three refrains on the jade zither,
The wind chilled the sky, the moon shone bright.

**Attaining the Dao and Delivering Others**
Twin iron flutes blow through the dawn mist,
Meeting again after so many years.
Once entrusted with the affairs of non-action beyond the world,
Now inscribed at the brush’s tip, never to be fully conveyed.
A few white hairs—you have grown old,
While I have ascended the blue clouds several times.
The world’s thorough inquiry ends only thus—
Why not roam together and return to the grotto-heaven?

**Summarizing Inner Work**
With pure and still body and mind, refine the inner medicine,
Cultivate qi and blood to restore youthful bearing.
Borrowing the lead cauldron to seek the true seed,
Infusing my mortal frame into the sage’s foundation.
Ten months of gestation with gentle fire,
Nine years facing the wall, nurturing the spirit-child.
Chang’e most loves the child’s youth,
Night after night, pipes and songs feast at the Jade Pool.

**Summarizing Outer Work**
True lead and true mercury unite as husband and wife,
Their mutual joy produces a child.
The young son grows up and leaves the ancestral estate,
The great-grandson takes charge, building a new foundation.
Expanding the family’s fortunes into three enterprises,
Grandly displaying the ninth branch of the lineage.
A room piled with gold—what is there to envy?
Behold the ascent of the entire household to the Jasper Pool.

**Ode to the Primordial Cauldron**
Whose daughter is this fourteen-year-old girl?
At her brows, a radiant glow.
All crave lust and desire,
I see her as my true mother.
A speck of spiritual elixir penetrates,
Her whole body exudes fragrant sweat.
In an instant, she dries my mercury,
Transforming my bones into pure yang.

**Twenty-Four Poems on the Golden Elixir**
*(These twenty-four poems on the Golden Elixir correspond to the twenty-four solar terms.)*

Luzhou’s Liao Fusheng, in his pirated edition, plagiarized for fame, once compiled ancient immortal poems into a collection titled *Awakening the Dao with Elegant Words*. He omitted the names of the perfected ones in most cases, attempting to pass them off as his own work—precisely what Master Zhengfeng called *"a ghost’s scheme of miserly greed stealing the mysterious Dao."* Now, following the authentic version of Immortal Wang, corrections have been made to restore the original. May those who love the Dao not be led astray.

Gathering the primordial to refine the later heaven,
The two qi circulate, sharing a common root.
To know the formed originates from the formless,
One must recognize the first and last crescents.
In the vast, dim moment when heaven and earth were dividing,
Before the dark parents were born.
Ingesting it, one remains in chaos like a dream,
Transforming into an infant with a lifespan of ten thousand years.

The moon itself has no light, borrowing the sun’s glow,
Each month from new moon to full, yin and yang are fixed.
The toad and crow unite in true essence,
The Oxherd and Weaver Girl meet in the boundless.
Naturally, the soul responds to the sacred spirit,
While heaven endures and earth lasts long.
If the student grasps the mystery within,
Their name will hang high in the Purple Palace, fragrant for ages.

Seven days of yang descend the Magpie Bridge,
The couple on the bridge roam freely.
Reversing the sea’s waters to flow into the Celestial Valley,
Inverting the sail to steer the Dipper’s handle.
Holding heaven and earth, dividing creation,
Relying on the years and months to traverse the cycle.
The immortal’s hands often do thus—
How could they contend with the petty with mere words!

The bellows blow with the wind of Xun,
Drawing Kun’s fire from the primordial chaos.
Slowly lifting it to Kunlun’s peak,
Gradually swallowing it back into the earthen crucible.
Lead and mercury unite to form the supreme treasure,
Spirit and essence congeal into an infant.
When it leaps beyond heaven and earth,
It no longer belongs to the turning of the celestial sphere.

Installing the furnace and establishing the cauldron to refine the golden elixir,
Water fears drying, fire fears cold.
Before forging, guard it constantly,
In the stages of *tun* and *meng*, watch diligently.
Drawing lead and adding mercury must be tight,
Beware of danger, do not relax.
A hair’s difference, and the work fails,
Abandoning halfway makes restarting difficult.

Dragon ascends, tiger descends, turning the river chariot,
Red fire captures and refines white sand.
The two qi congeal the embryo, lead naturally diminishes,
The three flowers gather at the crown, mercury returns and increases.
Opening the furnace, stir gently to form stalactites,
Raising the cauldron, know it is like horse’s teeth.
Grasp both substances without letting go,
Releasing them loses the beautiful golden flower.

Gathering from Kun’s earth where water and metal abound,
Planting in Qian’s home, entering the River of Love.
Yang fire and yin talismans follow advance and retreat,
Lead dragon and mercury tiger naturally harmonize.
Nectar collects in the east,
Wine intoxicates in the west with fine silk.
Only with utmost sincerity and diligent care,
After ten months of gestation, the embryo transforms into a blue maiden.

Seizing a speck of heaven and earth’s essence,
Yin and yang unite and naturally form.

Husband and wife unite to gather the three clans,
Wu and Ji intersect to cluster the five phases.
At new and full moons, the stirring and obscuring—chicken and rabbit leap,
At dark and crescent moons, the waning and waxing—tiger and dragon contend.
Heaven and earth are gathered within the mysterious pass,
The river chariot revolves with thunderous sound.
Within the body, water and fire are yin and yang,
The two qi mutually embrace and transform into purple light.
Daily, the ambrosial elixir extends life’s wine,
Hourly, one swallows and gulps the returning-soul nectar.
This mystery is not for the mediocre to know,
The great medicine must be tasted by the resolute.
When the nine revolutions are complete, return to the Great Beginning,
Earth’s softness is refined away, transforming into Heaven’s hardness.
Fire’s nature blazes, water’s nature flows,
The river chariot’s conveyance naturally cycles.
A fragment of Kunlun jade is priceless,
A luminous pearl of the vast sea is cast in darkness.
Samādhi first arises from below Li,
A single talisman first floats from within Kan.
Who can fathom one’s own subtle signs?
Do not broach the subject before others.
To cultivate immortality, one must cultivate Heavenly Immortality,
Observe carefully the divine elixir of golden liquid.
Add in the Li palace, withdraw from Kan,
Entrust to Dui’s position, plant in Qian.
Life and death are settled—not by spirit or qi,
But by the work on nature and destiny in mercury and lead.
In the world, those who chatter of the Dao—
Can ordinary folk grasp this true essence?
Refining the self to seek the real is not difficult,
First capture the rabbit’s marrow to pair with the crow’s liver.
Lead the dragon to the tiger, return to the root cavity,
Restrain mercury, cast lead into the gate of reviving life.
Golden qi comes and goes, passing through the spine,
The river chariot conveys upward to the mud-pill palace.
Husband and wife together enter the Yellow Dame’s abode,
Fire and timing harmonized, the elixir naturally forms.
Opening and closing, Heaven and Earth take the shape of bellows,
Stirring and obscuring—breathing the essence of Kan and Li.
The cauldron harmonizes the four images, true lead descends,
The furnace prepares the three talents, wondrous mercury arises.
One existence and two non-existences transform together,
Two non-existences and one existence mutually complete.
If one wishes to know the marvel within the mystery,
Carefully discuss the pairing with the blue maiden.
The central palace’s Wu and Ji know their own resonance,
Two substances, the matchmaker brings, share one heart.
The maiden of mercury blows the flute without holes,
The lord of metal cradles the zither without strings.
Deep and dense—who can fathom?
Vast and obscure—who can seek?
Once the returning elixir is accomplished,
All the earth shall be turned to gold.
The gentle lead cauldron permeates the curtains,
Recognize the living midnight hour within the body.
At the tiger’s roar, swiftly gather,
At the dragon’s first cry, urgently act.
Guarding the city, wild battles turn heaven and earth,
Entering the chamber, beware danger—Kan and Li alternate.
Seizing the round essence of tortoise and phoenix,
I invite you to partake and ascend to the Jasper Pool.
Enter the chamber with an empty mind to refine the great elixir,
The divine work’s wondrous use is not difficult.
Able to perceive Heaven’s craft and partake of primordial qi,
Understanding how to drink the knife’s edge and seize the purple pellet.
At new and full moons, talismans arrive—the three clans unite,
At dark and crescent moons, fire retreats—the five phases cluster.
Even if Chang’e flees to the moon’s cave,
How can she compare to the blue maiden riding the colored phoenix?
Mercury within wood, gold within water,
Do not idly seek in Li’s palace or Kan’s position.
Only by distinguishing host and guest in Qian and Kun,
And relying on dragon and tiger to determine rising and sinking,
Can metal and wood form the three clans,
Thus enabling husband and wife to share one heart.
Returning to the courtyard, they gather and meet,
The Yellow Dame as matchmaker is their confidant.
The true furnace, true cauldron reveal true mechanism,
Gathering the medicine must rely on the hour of Hai’s end.
The lead mother’s misty radiance stirs,
The golden embryo leaps as fire approaches.
Do not forget to regulate the breath and true rest,
Simply guard emptiness and revolve Kan and Li.
In battle, do not lightly release the enemy,
Be vigilant and cautious, ever on guard.
When the ten months’ work is complete, creation is firm,
If fire is added further, the elixir will be harmed.
In the immortal’s chamber, qi and blood are wholly forgotten,
The precious tripod and golden furnace need not be watched.
Facing the wall for nine years, the form sheds its husk,
The body transcends the three realms, sprouting wings.
Only because the millet grain was swallowed and returned to the belly,
The work overflows, complete—riding the phoenix.
Above, swallow the two crescents,
Step by step, guard and enter the jade field.
Coming and going, guest returns to host,
Husband and wife, wife and husband—reversed and harmonized.
Forming the elixir, one rejoices at the infant’s sign,
Emerging from the husk depends entirely on the holy mother.
Roam near and far, observe the four directions,
East and west, south and north—freely revolve.
Concealing brilliance, hiding traces in the red dust,
With action, who knows the marvel grows ever more real?
Taming tiger and subduing dragon requires mingling with the world,
Transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood startles all.
Deep and secret—cultivating the elixir’s way,
Bright and clear—manifesting the divine.
The *Mirror of Medicines* reveals all mysteries,
By this, ancients and moderns reach the celestial ford.
*The Golden Cinnabar*, *Triplex Unity*, and *Pointing to the Mystery*,
*The Emerald Void*—nature, destiny, loyalty, and immortality.
The *Precious Writ of the Yin Talisman* exceeds three hundred,
The *Sacred Text of the Dao and Virtue* spans five thousand.
In the *Mirror of Entering Medicines*, the bellows is expounded,
Within the *Awakening to Reality*, the fish-trap and rabbit-snare are explored.
The golden elixir’s urgent admonitions,
All discuss the prior and posterior crescents.
The work of fire and timing is fundamentally natural,
One who masters this mystery is a divine immortal.
The five phases cluster, stealing from Heaven and Earth,
The eight trigrams cycle, becoming sages and worthies.
In the crucible of creation, the sun and moon are refined,
Within the cauldron of Qian and Kun, the golden lotus is born.
If one grasps this subtle principle,
Follow me in flight to pay homage before the Emperor.
Reverently bow to the Star Lords,
Prostrate to the stars and constellations, guarding one’s body.
The twenty-eight lunar mansions all shine brightly,
The three hundred sixty degrees are fully arrayed.
The highest sages can gather years, months, and days,
The central palace preserves and unites qi and spirit.
Their illumination grants long life,
Their concealment renews like the two luminaries.
*Eight Poems on the Great Elixir*, inscribed in the Wudang Daoist chamber for disciples:

Cultivating the Dao, refining the real, departing the world’s dust,
Roaming clouds and waters, delighting in Heaven’s truth.
The numinous medicine within the body is not metal or stone,
The divine sand within the belly is not mercury!
Gathering and refining depend on the sun and moon,
Refining and heating—fire and timing match geng and shen.
The Yellow Dame as matchmaker unites the three families,
Drinking wine, admiring flowers—spring fills the land.
Gather the lead from another’s home,
Seize essence, refine qi, replenish the prior Heaven.
The prior crescent’s eight ounces, the posterior crescent’s eight,
When the inner medicine returns, the outer medicine returns.
The purple palace and mysterious chamber drip precious dew,
The yellow sprout and white snow transform into the golden toad.

The immortal’s wondrous work ever thus:
In fire, one may plant the nine-jointed lotus.
First barrier, middle barrier, and last barrier,
Lower field, middle field, and upper field—
Layers originally divided in perfect order,
Fire-work must follow the method with utmost care.
The chamber’s windows brighten by the third watch,
Day and night, the nine cauldrons glow crimson.
Civil and martial, yin and yang diligently refined,
Ten thousand apertures open to face Heaven.
The inner workings I know for myself—
Who has glimpsed such profound and wondrous mystery?

First, seek the dragon and tiger locked in battle,
Then behold the tortoise and snake singing in harmony.
Heaven and Earth inverted to observe fortune and adversity,
Fire talismans rise and cease in the Void and Danger.
Southern stars and Northern Dipper shine fore and aft,
Sun and moon, crow and toad, fly to and fro.

The great Dao of cultivating truth is the ancestor of Heaven and Earth,
Gathering yin and yang to master the work of creation.
To restrain the celestial soul and give birth to the White Tiger,
One must capture the earthly spirit to produce the Azure Dragon.
Circulating the supreme treasure to unite at the center,
Transforming the yang spirit to ascend to the upper palace.
A single qi condenses into one grain of elixir—
If one can swallow it, their countenance becomes youthful.

Daoist methods and side doors number in the thousands,
Yet without knowing the firing times, all is in vain.
First delve into the wondrous principles to attain true awakening,
Then bow to an enlightened teacher to receive the oral transmission.
To unite the three families in harmony,
Rely solely on the steadfastness of the Dao-heart.

Morning and night, temper the spirit and qi,
Refining until the true spirit coalesces and ascends to the Nine Heavens.
To seek truth, one must recognize the aperture of emptiness—
The work lies solely in where the intent arrives.
Coming and going, reversing and refining yin and yang,
Rising and descending, Kan and Li in inversion.
Vaguely, indistinctly, the Supreme Ultimate arises,
Faintly, obscurely, the infant takes form.
Exiting the mysterious and entering the feminine comes naturally,
As if forgotten, as if preserved—guarding the furnace and hearth.

Knowing the prior to refine the golden elixir,
If the fire cools or the water dries, the work is incomplete.
Supreme virtue, non-action, perfects the sage,
Lesser work, effort, lies in the Zhou Tian.
When the first yang stirs, Heaven and Earth are revealed,
When the two treasures unite, buddhas and immortals are born.
Planting flowers in the moon lasts but a moment,
Yet the toad’s radiance emerges, illuminating the western land.

*Jade Flower Poem*
Jade branches and trees belong to the immortals,
Such flowers unknown in the mortal world.
Their purity untouched by common rain and dew,
Their lofty bearing ever veiled in ancient mist and rosy clouds.
Ageless through the years, never growing old,
Peerless in the world—let none boast idly.
I would pluck them to return to Heaven,
Planning to borrow the divine raft from Bo Wang.

*Seven Absolute Quatrains*
The true heart vast and boundless,
Infinite immortals arise from within.
Mortals cling to their petty forms,
Yet none recognize the single pearl of mystery!

Again:
Buddha’s seal points to emptiness as awakening,
Dan Yang’s secret breaks the "nothing" to reveal "something."
Seize the original, primal point of truth,
And for myriad ages, the body shall not decay.

Again:
Flowing upstream straight to Penglai,
Scattering sweet springs to moisten the nine realms.
From this, the elixir field receives moisture,
And golden sprouts bloom everywhere at once.

Again:
Years, months, days, and hours are but empty marks,
Hexagrams, lines, and weights—mere fragments.
If one grasps the unbroken thread of intent,
It is precisely the time of neither forgetting nor forcing.

Again:
The great medicine is but a single pill,
Yet it must seek its kindred to rejoice in union.
If mortals ask for the secret of longevity,
First seek the dual elixirs of yin and yang.

*Essential Mysteries, Part Three*
Ascending the high terrace—following the *Cantong Qi*’s line,
*"Close the eyes and ascend the high terrace,"*
as if breaking through the profound mystery,
making the heart and eyes bright,
like ascending a high terrace to see all near and far.
This tune takes its name therefrom.

The wondrous workings of the golden elixir are hard to express,
Who can discern the subtle principles of the mysterious and minute?
Fortunately, meeting an enlightened teacher’s guidance,
One breaks through the sky within the water.

First, they teach us to guard the mysterious pass,
Sit cross-legged to harmonize spirit, principle, and qi,
Banish thoughts, seal the senses, and lower the eyelids.
Next, they teach us to stir the wind of Xun,
Circulate water and fire,
Guard the true essence,
Preserve the original yang,
And turn the celestial gate.

Then one sees the Yellow River’s waters surging upstream,
From the Bubbling Spring,
Through the Tailbone Pass,
To the Spine Bridge,
Ascending to the Mud Pill Palace.
Passing the Hall of Light,
Entering the Flower Pool,
The divine water gradually rises,
Descending the Towering Pavilion,
Entering the Crimson Palace,
Until reaching the elixir field.
This is the work of laying the foundation and refining the self—
Henceforth, one dwells in the world to prolong life.
This is the lesser returning elixir’s work.

If one further seeks the supreme path of ascension,
They must once more establish the furnace and set up the cauldron,
Gathering the prior Heaven to match the posterior Heaven.
At midnight and noon, focus on the firing times,
At dawn and dusk, bathe the golden elixir.
They further teach us first to understand the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,
Then to distinguish yin and yang.
Heaven exists only with the Mother,
Without the Mother, there is no Heaven—
This is the root of the great Dao.

Count the Zhou Tian from the beginning,
Invert and arrange Qian and Kun.
Diligently refine the posterior Heaven,
Seize the prior Heaven to become a sage or immortal.

I have already bowed to an enlightened teacher,
Heart to heart, mouth to mouth, the transmission received.
When laying the foundation, first clarify the bellows and key,
When refining the self, use only true lead.
The fullness within Kan is taken from Li,
The emptiness within Li is filled by Kan’s return.
In reversal, the immortal dragon swallows the tiger’s marrow,
In sequence, the mortal tiger seizes the dragon’s saliva.

What delights is the Wood Dragon concealing mercury,
What is cherished is the Metal Tiger spitting lead.
The moon’s fullness depends on the oral formula,
The midnight hour’s wonder lies in the heart’s transmission.
Gathering the prior Heaven’s work relies entirely on Wu and Ji,
Seizing the posterior Heaven’s qi begins with the dragon and tiger’s first crescent.
Azure Dragon and White Tiger locked in battle,
Jade Hare and Golden Horse grappling in one place.

Beware only of lacking the sword of wisdom within,
Fear only being unable to pull the boat at the rapids’ edge.
Wait only for the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking,
Await only the Maiden’s lotus blossoming.

This matter is hard to speak of—
Within five thousand days, you must calculate,
In thirty hours, silently revolve.
Before midnight and after noon, observe clearly:
Lead-yang not yet stirred,
Gui appears before,
True lead, true yang follow behind.
When the medicine arrives at the furnace,
Do not be negligent at this moment—
Swiftly seize and draw it into the pass,
Then apply the six hundred measures of withdrawal and addition.

In the tenth month, the embryo is complete, the infant appears,
Facing the wall for nine years, alone revealing the true essence,
Only then becoming an immortal beyond the world in Penglai’s paradise.

Following the ancestral masters’ lyrics and melodies,
No prior notation exists—only to elucidate the Dao’s intent.
Yet these notations were all created by the ancients;
Why not innovate from our own antiquity?
*"Ascending the High Terrace"* takes its name from the *Cantong qi*,
Fittingly harmonizing with the profound sound’s elegant title.
Some say the theme is ingenious but the divisions too numerous,
Unaware that in lyric forms like *"The Whistling Patrol"* or *"Oriole’s Song Sequence,"*
Three or four divisions are common—what harm in four here?
One must not be constrained by *ling*, *man*, single, or double forms.

*The Celestial Immortal* was vulgarly rendered as *"Southern Palace Lyrics,"*
Its original name being *The Celestial Immortal’s Lure*.
As the *Wuzhen pian* states: *"To learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality;
Only the golden elixir is most authentic,"* whence the original name was drawn,
Imploring deep reflection.
The latter four tunes differ slightly,
Yet by lyricists’ standards of division, this piece stands as the first form.

Seeking heaven within earth,
Chasing lightning amidst clouds.
Moment by moment, rein in the galloping mind-horse,
Instant by instant, lock the restless heart-ape.
Day and night without sleep,
Refining the self’s work without pause,
Holding fast to the will with ever-greater firmness.
Guard the Three Treasures within, abiding in the deep abyss,
Seize the Five Thieves without, observing the celestial gardens.
Let self and other rest in suchness and stability,
Make yin and yang invert and overturn.
Repelling all demons with the sword of wisdom,
Gathering the Black Tortoise’s incipient qi,
Drawing from the White Tiger’s first crescent.
Erect the Heavenly Root,
Suspend the Moon’s Hollow.
Display divine powers by planting lotuses in fierce flames,
Wield the craftsman’s hand to pole a boat on weak waters.
Sweep clean to still the heart and quiet the mind,
Nurture to fill the essence and complete the qi.
No envy for lovely, delicate flowers,
Only awaiting the sweet path of nectar and springs,
Causing the passionless to relinquish their mortal guise.
Assault the divine continent, breach the crimson realm,
Seize the golden essence and carefully lead it,
Escort it into the cinnabar field.
Guard against peril, dispel distractions,
Stabilize the breath, calm the spirit, sever delusive ties,
Bathe and cleanse the heart, cease all strife—
The sacred embryo emerges unobstructed.
Facing the wall for nine years,
Refining spirit to return to emptiness,
Thus is our work’s course complete.

**Second Form**
Behold the *Returning to the Root and Restoring Life* chapter,
Observe the *Nurturing Nature and Cultivating Truth* scroll.
Only then know water within metal,
Only then recognize heaven within earth.
Subtle and wondrous, wondrously subtle—
Life and death are but a thread apart,
Dragon and Tiger concealed in the two crescents.
Expound the mysterious female in the *Dao and Virtue* immortal scriptures,
Plumb the *Wuzhen* sagely canon’s *wu* and *ji*.
Discuss the *geng* direction where metal is born,
Speak of the *dui* position where medicine’s river flows,
Pointing clearly to the crimson realm.
Like dew, like lightning,
Like mist, like smoke—
Only awaiting the Black Tortoise’s exhalation,
The White Tiger’s spittle.
Slay the Three Corpses, extinguish the demon’s lair,
Capture the Five Thieves, still the horse, lull the ape to sleep.
Pursue the spirit-qi into the returning sea,
Circulate the true qi through the bubbling spring,
Gather the golden essence into the cinnabar field.
Naturally penetrating,
Flowing through every joint of the body.
Heart like fire,
Intent like lightning—
Nurturing the golden elixir,
Mercury gradually added, closing *dui* and forgetting speech.
Nine years facing the wall, work unceasing,
The Great Ultimate’s spirit roams the boundless,
The sevenfold infant naturally appears.
Six Thieves vanish,
Five Phases complete their numbers,
The world’s people know to return to Penglai’s paradise.

**Third Form**
First regulate the breath evenly,
Then unite metal and wood.
Lead-essence concealed in the female’s gate,
Mercury-fluid hidden in the mysterious portal—
The root of creation.
In the profound and obscure, there is trust;
In the indistinct and imperceptible, no sight or sound.
Nurture the medicine’s sprout, ever keeping the furnace whole,
Pluck the yellow sprout, never letting the tripod be damaged.
Let the original spirit not stray from the square inch,
Seek the golden water to irrigate Kunlun.
Wield the sword of wisdom to pursue and press the demon horde,
Guard the Three Treasures, hold the heart and intent with care,
Seize the Five Thieves, diligently refine the self,
Sever greed and wrath, dispel ten thousand cares,
Encounter scenes without staining a single dust.
I only await:
At Qujiang’s shore, the moon spits forth *gengshen*,
On Xingshan’s peaks, treading snow to seek spring.
Gather the golden essence as it departs the crimson waters,
Harmonize the true breath to circulate through the body,
Circulate one’s own mercury to envelop the yang essence.
The furnace fire ever warm,
Moment by moment, ceaselessly advancing.
Like the foolish, like the dull,
Silently sitting, forgetting speech,
Guarding poverty to preserve the whole truth.
I turn to the deep mountains, facing the wall where none inquire,
In the quiet chamber, with ashen heart, only I am intimate.
Regulate the spirit-breath,
Rely on our teachings—
Not speaking of ten months’ gestation,
Only nine years’ toil,
Today, the work complete, the merit round, one verifies the origin.

**Fourth Form**
Leisurely perusing the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*,
Quietly savoring the *Entering the Medicine Mirror*—
Originally, lead is but one flavor,
Falsely given many names.
It lurks in the water’s depths,
Bestowed upon the crown of the reclusive,
Residing in the alchemical pit.
Scarlet, it hides in sweet springs,
Densely packed, it conceals itself in the cinnabar well.
I only await:
At the winter solstice, when the first yang stirs,
At the autumn equinox, when the second qi ascends.
The Flowery Pond’s trustworthy pearl bursts forth,
Acting with benevolence, establishing virtue,
Setting up justice, preparing punishments,
Guarding against deceit,
Drawing forth joyful passions.
Observe the divine continent’s qi flourishing, yang surging,
See the crimson realm’s *gui* stirring, lead arising.
Scarlet, the Dragon’s head erects,
Crimson, the Tortoise’s eye rounds,
Black, the Tiger’s mouth roars.
Contending to display their powers,
Making yin and yang invert,
Uniting metal and wood.
Seize the northern Dark Warrior’s tortoise essence,
Lock it in the Yellow Court.
Bathe and constantly sweep the Three Fields clean,
Temper and nurture, ensuring the ninefold transmutation’s numinosity.
Accumulate eight hundred deeds of hidden virtue,
Name inscribed in the Upper Clarity,
Spirit ascends to Jade Capital,
Feasting concludes, drunk on the peaches of immortality.

**Fifth Form**
No indulgence for the galloping mind-horse,
How could the restless heart-ape be released?
Three Corpses unperturbed,
Six Thieves all subdued.
Demon realms all forgotten,
Preserving robust spirit,
Harmonizing strong qi and blood.

All cares forgotten, leaving behind greed and wrath,
Myriad entanglements cease—no false thoughts arise.
I dispatch the divine maiden to tend the furnace and forge the sword,
Pairing metal and water to balance soft and hard.
Relying on the smith’s hands, I seize and capture as easily as turning a palm,
Unlocking the elixir’s gate, loosing the Dragon and Tiger’s bonds.
I drink the wine of extended years,
Savor the nectar of prolonged life.
The elixir enters my belly, fragrance suffuses my body,
Passion yields to nature, bones transform, yang revives.
Still the heart’s landscape, seal the earthen crucible tight,
Extinguish the mind’s spring, close the chamber deep.
Far from sound and color, I guard the true constant,
Vigilant against harm—should I encounter indulgence, I do not lightly lose myself.
After ten months, the infant descends,
Nurtured to full numinosity, meeting the spirit, I stride alone through the immortal realm.
Who knows that within stillness, heaven and earth are vast?
I love the long days and months within the gourd.
Let the world’s slander and praise be as they may—
Clad in cloud-robes and crane-feathered cloak,
Holding the cinnabar script and jade tablet,
The immortals of the Purple Palace all celebrate.

This tune, *"Heavenly Immortal’s Invitation,"* was composed by the Patriarch,
Its name’s meaning most refined and proper.
For it must be thus—this is the great Dao of the Golden Elixir.
Were it taken as a *Nangong* lyric, it would be diminished.
The *Nangong* belongs to the talismanic school,
Distinct from the Golden Elixir.
Those who reach the *Nangong* still face rebirth before attaining the Way.
As the *Supreme Scripture for Salvation* states:
*"Those of shallow learning, whose immortal rank is unfulfilled,
When their destined end arrives, their bodies pass through the Great Yin.
At the hour of passage, fellow students and perfected ones
Burn incense and recite the scripture ten times to deliver the corpse.
By this method, the hun-soul ascends directly to the Nangong,
Where, according to their merit, they await rebirth,
Turning the wheel without annihilation before achieving immortality."*
Thus, the *Nangong* stream consists of those who seize bodies and transmigrate.
How could the sublime purport of Heavenly Immortals be named after the *Nangong*?

This lyric must not be divided arbitrarily.
Here, it is split into two parts where division is possible.
The Zhang-Deng edition divides it into three:
The first part as *"Magpie Bridge,"*
The second as *"Jade Maiden Shakes the Immortal’s Girdle-Pendants,"*
The third as *"Coda,"*—likely arranged for *Daoist ballads*.
Yet *"Magpie Bridge"* and *"Jade Maiden"* are ancient tune names.
Since the Patriarch’s composition does not rigidly follow old melodies,
Such reckless naming lacks meaning.
Here, I follow the Wang edition.
*"A Branch of Flowers"* is also titled *"Fair Golden Flower."*
As Elder Yuchan’s *"Song of Joy"* says:
*"At midnight, a branch of spring in the yellow sprout,"*
And this collection’s *"After the Fifth Watch"* reads:
*"A branch of spring’s hue, the golden flower’s beauty,"*
Thus, this tune’s name is taken from these lines.

The lyrics follow the Peng Haogu selection, the Zhang-Deng edition,
And *The Mirror of Immortals* for collation.

**First Stanza**
Cultivating the work of creation,
At the outset, harmonizing primordial qi.
Since receiving the master’s transmission,
I alone guard non-action.
The Jade Fluid ever refined,
Original qi returns to its true seat.
Piercing the Three Passes,
Passing the Tail Gate,
Reversing the River Chariot to ascend Mud Pill.
Striking Kunlun, thunder shakes the earth,
Sweet springs well forth, fragrant as honey.
Entering the Jade Pool, it transforms into Golden Fluid,
Freely drinking the sweet dew that drips down.
Descending the Twelve-Storied Tower’s steps,
Firmly sealed and guarded, I hold fast—
Originally, these are the three: essence, qi, and spirit.
Returning to the root, restoring life,
Originally, these are the five: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, gathered in confluence.
Within the mysterious, the deathless Reverted Elixir;
Within the wondrous, the root of life-extension.
Who does not practice? Who does not comprehend? Who does not act?
All lies in failing to grasp the precelestial aperture—
How could one dare to act recklessly?
I, too, amidst the flowers,
Drum the bamboo, play the zither, my heart like still water.
From now on, I fathom the true message,
Forgetting things, forgetting form.
Before midnight and after noon, I persist;
At dawn and dusk, the hours of bathing.
What need to speak of the wheel of birth and death?
What need to speak of the Girl and Infant?
All is but the gathering of that single grain of millet from uncarved chaos.

**Second Stanza**
The heart like a lotus rising from water,
The mind like lightning flashing through clouds.
Last night, over a trifle,
I strayed into the Pleasure Garden.
Hour by hour, I rein in the mind-horse,
Moment by moment, I lock the heart-ape.
Day and night without sleep,
Refining the self, my work unceasing.
Sealing the Three Treasures within the Yellow Chamber,
Capturing the Five Thieves, I gaze outward upon the Upper Court.
Commanding self and other to be thus—steady, unshaken,
Making yin and yang invert, overturn.
Brandishing the keen-edged sword, I drive back the hordes of demons,
Daring to pluck those fresh blossoms beyond the wall.
I don my iron face, born of my mother,
Leaving them not the slightest room to stir.
Lovely celestial forms, delicate ten fingers—
None can sway my mind-horse or heart-ape.
I am a touchstone—truth or falsehood instantly revealed;
A steel steamed bun—hard to bite;
A sea of purity—untouched by a speck of dust;
A luminous pearl—ever suspended in emptiness.
The Dao firm, my resolve distant,
From youth, I tempered body and heart.
Cutting off fame and profit, refusing greed,
Seizing the Three Corpses, searing them in the crucible.
My heart is steadfast,
My mastery of creation unseen by others.
I grieve only that my work remains unfinished, my name unmade,
Time wasted in vain;
I grieve that days and months race like shuttles, youth fleeting.
One day, I shall turn the Celestial Gate,
Soaring midair—
Only then will I expound the cold, aloof teachings of the Daoist school.

**Third Stanza**
First, comprehend heaven and earth’s mechanism,
Next, pair yin and yang.
Heaven existed before the Mother,
Without the Mother, there would be no heaven—
This is the root of Daoist teaching.
Counting the celestial cycles from the beginning,
Reversing and settling qian and kun.
The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission,
The hour of midnight’s wonder lies in heart-to-heart teaching.
Raising my sword, keen and bladeless,
I fear only the rushing rapids where the boat is hard to moor.
I am moved by the Yellow Dame’s guidance,
I await the Maiden’s unfolding lotus—
This matter is hard to speak of.

Five thousand days—count them with steadfast resolve,
Thirty hours—silent reckoning in the dark.
I raise the dragon’s head upright,
He suspends the moon’s cavern in empty space.
Manifesting divine power, planting lotus in fierce flames,
Wielding the craftsman’s hand to pole a boat against the current.
I do not envy the beauty of delicate blossoms,
I await only the sweet dew and nectarous spring.
Assaulting the divine realm, shattering the crimson land,
Seizing the golden essence to lead it carefully,
Guiding it into the cinnabar field.
Guarding against peril, dispelling stray thoughts,
Bathing in nature’s purity.
Facing the wall for nine years,
Only then does one become an immortal of Penglai beyond the mortal world.

**Fourth Stanza**
In seeking the profound Dao,
I traversed the ends of the earth.
Forsaking fame, power, and profit,
Abandoning home, estate, and fields.
Through myriad hardships,
Clothes tattered, shoes worn—yet the master remained unseen.
I grieve that sixty or seventy years of light pass so swiftly,
Entering Zhongnan, moved to receive the Fire Dragon’s oral transmission.
Commanded to descend the mountain, to seek companions and hunt for lead.
Visiting renowned sages far and wide,
Only to find them scheming, miserly, and thieving the mysterious Dao.
Yet it was my destined karmic cause to transcend the world,
Fortunate to meet Shen Wansan, who upheld righteousness and scorned wealth.
Alas, his strength was too meager to fulfill the task,
So I had no choice but to tend the furnace and refine the elixir.
After nine cycles were complete,
I entered the Pleasure Garden to gather herbs and enact talismans,
Spending five years on Mount Wudang.
Facing the wall to harmonize the spirit for another nine years,
Suddenly, the imperial summons arrived.
Though I wished to avoid the sovereign’s gaze,
I feared for Minister Hu’s life.
Riding clouds straight to the Chaoyang Hall,
The emperor rejoiced, his dragon countenance beaming.
I longed to transmit the teachings mouth-to-mouth,
But feared defying the Jade Emperor’s decree—
Thus, I mounted the phoenix and soared to the nine heavens.

*Ode to the Hibernating Dragon*
*Fisherman’s Song*

The Hibernation Method is soundless yet resounds,
Its voice and speech heard only by the inner heart.
The spirit silent, the qi obscure,
The hibernating dragon, though asleep, remains awake.

*Hibernating Dragon’s Chant*
Sleeping immortal, sleeping immortal,
High upon stone roots, years forgotten in repose,
The Three Lights sink, yet nature remains whole.
Qi by qi returns to the Mysterious Cavity,
Breath by breath follows nature’s course.
Do not scatter, must remain serene,
Nurturing mercury’s nature to perfection,
Waiting for lead’s blossom to appear.
No loss, no negligence,
True firing times, operated within.
Seven returns, no hardship,
Nine refinements, why lament?
Quietly observe the battlefield of dragon and tiger,
Secretly invert yin and yang.
People call me a drowsy fool,
Yet I sleep—yet sleep not.
Mastered, true reclining meditation,
Cultivated, the true primordial embryo.
When the hibernating dragon stirs, it ascends to heaven.
This hibernation method—who transmitted it?
Folding arms for a pillow, from Mount Ni’s self,
Joy lies within, unknown to others.
Five dragons leap from the deep abyss,
Heaven bestowed this method to Tu Nan.
Who in Tu Nan’s lineage could inherit?
The slovenly Daoist Zhang Fengxian.

*Two Odes to Beautiful Golden Flower*
**Note on Title:** As *Cantong Qi* states: *"Ancient records title it* Dragon and Tiger*, the Yellow Emperor praises* Golden Flower.*"* *Dragon and Tiger* and *Golden Flower* are both ancient scriptures left by sages. Alchemists compare the golden flower to true lead, hence the *Contract* says: *"At last obtaining the golden flower, turning and interdependent. The flower is white liquid, congealing into utmost hardness."* This speaks of mercury transformed by true lead into liquid, entering the Yellow Court to become the supreme treasure. It also says: *"Lead’s body is black without, yet harbors the golden flower within."* Thus, in elixir-making, white gold is extracted from black lead, refining the earth of wu and xu. Named *"Beautiful Golden Flower,"* the golden flower’s value is thus supreme. The tune’s name is taken from this.

Golden flowers bloom fresh,
Without wealth, cultivation is difficult.
Dare not speak to others,
Each calculates their own means.
Seeking external protection, yet no worthy master met,
Holding fast to heaven’s mechanism for years.
Testing briefly, wonders grow more profound,
Relying on the sword of wisdom to gather the primordial.
Only now do I know the Dao lies before me,
At last believing the golden elixir has a true transmission.
Blowing the flute without holes,
Plucking the stringless zither.
Delighting in yellow sprouts and white snow,
Cherishing the first scripture’s red lead.
Drinking the wine of life extension,
Ingesting the soul-returning elixir.
Engaged in the work within the pot,
Playing with the golden toad at the sea’s bottom.
Seizing sun and moon to refine in the furnace,
Seizing heaven and earth to simmer in the crucible.
This is my true cultivation secret,
A layman’s guise.
Regretting that in the past, I had no wealth,
Day and night pleading to heaven, pitiful indeed.
Now, at last, fortune turns,
Awaiting only the completion of my work and the perfection of merit,
Then casting off to become an immortal beyond the world.

*Again*
Golden flower, jade bud fresh,
The world finds it hard to discern.
For longevity, one must subdue qi,
For grafting, true lead is needed.
Laying the foundation, refining the self,
After gathering, the postnatal jade liquid returns as elixir.
Even if one attains longevity in this world,
One must still seek the nine refinements of golden liquid.
Alas, those who study immortality,
Each and all blindly cultivate and recklessly refine,
Step by step, who understands true investigation?
Throughout heaven and earth, yellow sprouts grow everywhere,
Across the cosmos, white flowers bloom in full,
All awaiting the moment when water is exhausted, gold is born, and the moon is full.
Here, I wield the precious sword upon Southern Mountain,
Slaying the seven emotions and six desires,
Severing the entanglements of love and affection,
Sweeping away the floating clouds of ten thousand li,
Not a speck of dust remains.
Startling the five ghosts and three corpses, their hearts turn cold.
I invert yin and yang,
Employing divine strategy to silently harmonize the Zhou Tian,
Guarding body and mind against danger and peril.
Gently shaking the earth’s axis,
Slowly turning the heavenly gate,
A thunderclap resounds beyond the heavens.

*The Heavenly Mechanism in a Single Secret*
As *The Song of Knocking on the Hexagrams* says: *"People of this age do not grasp the principle within the flower, a single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold."* The tune’s name is taken from this.

I tell you the true oral secret,
Point to the moon at heaven’s edge.
When the moon is full, the jade bud appears,
When the moon wanes, the golden flower falls.
Three and five follow the seasons,
Old and young carefully distinguished.
Sent to the Yellow Dame’s abode,
Never let it leak or escape.
Grafting, grafting,
The spirit turtle drinks the Golden Crow’s blood to the last drop.
Resolute, resolute,
Become a guest of Penglai’s three isles.

*The Song of the Mysterious Pass’s Union*
The Great Dao is beyond words,
Its wondrous principle hard to exhaust,
The Mysterious Pass—a single secret of Damo.
Above, to Kunlun’s Niwan peak,
Below, to the deep abyss of Yongquan’s cave.
Lead as mother, mercury as father,
The leaves of lead and mercury—yin and yang—unite as one,
The maiden and infant rest together.

*The Song of Yin-Yang Union*
Inverting Kan within Li,
Dragon and tiger meet in wind and cloud.
A wondrous point encompasses heaven and earth,
Its minute size unknown to men,
Returning three and revolving five to penetrate heaven’s mechanism.
Li returns to Kan, Kan returns to Li,
Kan and Li’s water and fire move east and west,
Infant and maiden become husband and wife.
Yin steals yang’s essence to take Kan’s reality,
Yang subdues yin’s spirit to fill Li’s emptiness,
Three threes and six sixes divide heaven and earth.
These practices are not easy,
Transforming heaven and earth, leaking primordial qi.

*Pure Chant of the Grotto-Heaven (Six Refrains)*
From Qiu Zu’s *Song of the Azure Sky*: *"Day and night, the pure youth fills the grotto-heaven,"* referring to the moment when the solitary truth is fully revealed. The tune’s name is taken from this.

**First Refrain**
I only await to cleave open the chaos and embrace the primordial,
To split asunder the vast emptiness and reveal the aperture.
I only await to find a single drop of life-continuing nectar,
To seek a sprig of soul-returning herb.
I but see the tiger’s roar summon the tide of qi,
The stirring of *gui* sprouts the medicine’s shoot.
When the Yellow Dame teaches the zither’s harmony,
And the Metal Duke strikes the bamboo clappers,
Unawares, the cinnabar field burns hot—
The life-treasure has returned to the Yellow Way.
At that moment, regulate spirit and breath in even measure,
Silently witness water and fire commingle.

**Second Refrain**
I take up the bottomless basket, borne by another’s labor,
I cradle the stringless lute to my breast.
Gently I pluck the crimson phoenix’s head aright,
Stealthily I bore into the black turtle’s aperture.
Seizing yang qi, I cross the Magpie Bridge,
Wielding yin talismans, I swiftly enfold.
Suddenly, the mud-pill palace boils like broth,
The cinnabar field blazes like fire.
Setting up *zhun* and *meng*, I forget dawn and dusk,
Permeating the four limbs, the warmth steams through.
Should demonic visions beckon,
Here I remain—still, thus, unshaken.

**Third Refrain**
Refining the self, I pacify the five thieves,
Transforming the scene, I merge the seven emotions.
Subduing the six desires, I bring them to quiescence,
Sweeping clean the three fields, I leave them pristine.
Nature settled, it naturally attains numinosity,
The heart emptied, inner illumination shines.
Harmonizing firm and yielding,
Metal and water in concord ascend to meet yin and yang,
Reversing their course.
Once the *jiji* work is complete,
The ten thousand spirits all heed command.
Hearing the summons, I ascend in flight—
My name is already inscribed on the steps of the Cinnabar Terrace.

**Fourth Refrain**
I only await to conceal myself in the marketplace, silently cultivating the work...

I await only to choose a propitious place for my practice;
I await only to wield the sword of wisdom, nurturing the white snow,
Relying on the craftsman’s hand to plant the yellow sprout;
I await only to stir the fire and refine true emptiness,
Seeking the light to shatter primordial chaos;
I await only to gather the two qi into the Li chamber,
Harvesting the single yang to enter the Zhen palace.
Following Master Jingyang’s footsteps, I ascend on wings of cinnabar phoenix;
Emulating the divine prowess of the Yellow Emperor, I soar astride a fiery dragon.

**Fifth Refrain**
Gather the essence of lead, pair it with the sprout of mercury,
Erect the furnace and tripod, cultivate the mystery’s essentials.
Seize the mechanism of heaven and earth’s creation,
Comprehend the wondrous waxing and waning of sun and moon.
Unite water and fire, kindling left and right,
Commanding hun and po to intermingle in exchange.
Follow the four seasons without missing their sequence,
Align with the eight nodes, responding to the trigrams’ lines.
Discern dawn and dusk, clarify growth and decline,
Observe the celestial Dao—twelve circuits of the celestial sphere must be completed.

**Sixth Refrain**
The seven-return great pearl illumines the nature,
The nine-return golden liquid completes the great elixir.
With a thunderous clap, the true person emerges from the crown.

**Two Lyrics of the Pleasure Garden of Beautiful Spring**

In the Pleasure Garden of Beautiful Spring, the moon’s wheel hangs high,
Jade trees bloom anew, breaking the silence.
At midnight, the cinnabar furnace is opened,
At the third watch, the Dipper’s handle is turned.
Who has ever reached the Silver River of the Milky Way?
The Cowherd and Weaver Girl laugh from the edge of heaven.
In the Purple Palace, the assembly of immortals gathers—
Return, return! The dust of the mundane is washed away.

Again,
In the Pleasure Garden of Beautiful Spring, the sun’s radiance is clear,
The golden liquid and returned elixir are already refined.
To make emotion return to nature,
One must merge nature with emotion.
Wealth, honor, and fame—ask no more,
The infant boy and maiden girl are most enchanting.
The furnace and tripod radiate light—
From here, one journeys to the summit of Kunlun.

**West River Moon**
The Dao resides in the mysterious pass, a single aperture,
The aperture embraces primordial qi and primordial essence.
Primordial essence and primordial qi nourish the primordial spirit,
When the spirit is full, movement and stillness arise naturally.
In movement and stillness, three revolutions and nine transformations,
Circulating through the changes of heaven and earth.
Heaven and earth inverted, planting the flower’s root—
The root blossoms, and the West River Moon shines true.

**Two Lyrics on the "Rootless Tree"**

**To the Tune of "Partridge Sky"**
*(Note: The fifth and sixth lines are three-character phrases, rhyming as one, following the "Partridge Sky" form. One version reads "Difficult / To debate with worldly folk," combining two lines into one, resembling "Auspicious Partridge." Both versions are preserved here.)*

The Dao’s methods flow with orthodoxy and heterodoxy,
Those who enter heterodoxy and turn from orthodoxy fill the earth.
Rarely seen are phoenixes soaring through the clouds,
Many are those who drown, becoming well-frogs.
Difficult to debate,
Amid the clamor,
All take red earth for cinnabar.
To know the true path to the mysterious,
Study closely the flower beneath the rootless tree.

**To the Tune of "Selling Flowers"**
Beneath the rootless tree, the eternal constant is spoken,
The six paths unite in spirit, sharing one light.
Comprehending matters before and after the sound of majesty,
Originally without coming or going, bearing a dignified form.

**Twenty-Four Daoist Songs on the "Rootless Tree"**
*(In the world, there are two interpretations of the "Rootless Tree," elucidating the primordial mystery without omission. Those with aspiration for the Dao should peruse them.)*

**Topic Explanation:**
The "rootless tree" refers to the lead qi within the human body.
Within the realm of emptiness, the alchemist nurtures a rootstock—both precelestial and postcelestial arise from nothing into being. Thus it is said: *"Though spoken of as rootless, it indeed has roots."*

Those refining the postcelestial must enter nothingness to seek being, then cast being into nothingness;
Those refining the precelestial must enter being into nothingness, then return from nothingness to being.
The cultivation of the root and foundation is thus.

All twenty-four songs urge one to study closely the immortal flower beneath the rootless tree. The subtleties of medicinal substances, celestial timing, grafting, and harvesting are fully contained within—these are the immortal verses of Daoist songs.

---
The rootless tree, its flower now secluded,
Who in this red dust would cultivate?
Floating life’s affairs are a boat on the bitter sea,
Tossed to and fro, never free.
Boundless and shore-less, hard to moor,
Ever sailing through the perils of dragons and fish.
If you would turn your head, it is the shore—
Do not wait for the winds and waves to wreck your boat.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flower now faint,
The old tree renewed by grafting tender branches.
Peach grafted onto willow, mulberry onto pear,
Passed down as a model for those who cultivate the true.
Since ancient times, the immortals’ method of grafting—
Even the aged can be healed with medicine.
Seek a bright teacher, inquire of the method,
Begin swiftly—even then, it may be too late.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flower now verdant,
From ancient times to now, flower-wine immortals abound.
In the brothel’s camp, within the wine’s forest,
Avoiding meat and lewdness, avoiding lust.
Lust forfeits the treasure of long life,
Meat and wine pass through the gut, yet the Dao resides in the heart.
Open the door, I tell you:
Without wine and flowers, the Dao cannot be achieved.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flower now solitary,
I ask: does yin and yang find its kind?
A hen’s egg cannot hatch a chick,
Turning from the furnace of yin and yang’s creation.
A woman without a husband is a resentful maiden,
A man without a wife is a widowed bachelor.
Alas, the deluded ones, so muddled—
Sitting in solitude, refining qi until it withers.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flower now askew,
Departing from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.
Gold separated from wood, mercury from lead,
Yang widowed, yin solitary—each to its own side.
In the world, yin and yang pair man with woman,
Bearing sons and grandsons, generation after generation.
Following the flow makes one mortal,
Reversing it makes one immortal—
It lies only in the inversion of the cheekbones.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flower now fresh,
Born in the Kun direction—Kun is human.
Pluck the flower, wear it,
Gather the flower’s heart,
Layer upon layer of the flower’s pistil, resplendent in spring’s beauty.
Worldly folk do not grasp the principle within the flower,
A single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.
Borrow the flower’s name to make the flower’s body,
Every line of *"Knocking on the Trigrams"* speaks truly.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flower now lush,
Its smiling face and delicate features like powdered silk.
Guard against the monkey and horse, stubborn and unruly,
Hang up the iron face born of your mother.
Draw forth the true treasure sword of the Azure Dragon,
Pluck every blossom from the garden wall.
Hoist the sails to the wind, fully laden return—
How could one journey empty-handed to the mountain of treasure!

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now in flight,
Shedding to bloom again at fixed times.
When the lead-flower appears, as *gui* wanes,
Once more the Western Garden’s branches bloom full.
Just gathered beneath the moon, they’re mended at dawn—
Patching the robe in the morning sun.
This subtle mystery, rare in the world,
Must be pondered with immortals, carefully weighed.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now in bloom,
Plucked from the crescent-moon furnace.
They lengthen years, lessen illness and woe,
Forming good bonds to prepare the dharma-wealth.
From this, the treasure of heaven may be wrought—
Let the deluded masses laugh at my folly.
I urge the wise: cease your cleverness,
Without a true master, do not force your guesses.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now full,
Fruits ripened, their flavor complete.
Like crimson tangerines or pellets round,
Guard the embankments well—never idle.
Learn the method of plants: gathering at the head,
Returning life to the root, reverting to the origin.
Choose a sacred site, build a Daoist hut,
Unite with the primordial to complete the great return.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now flourishing,
Spoken of as rootless, yet it has roots.
The three talents’ apertures, the two-five essences,
When heaven and earth unite, the ten thousand things are born.
When sun and moon conjoin, cold and heat align,
When man and woman unite, conception begins.
How clear this is, I tell you plainly—
Only fear we meet yet fail to recognize the truth.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now fine,
Facing the scene, forgetting emotion, savoring moonlight.
Golden essence flourishes, dazzling the eye—
Do not pluck the wrong melon in the garden.
The five metals and eight stones are all false,
The ten thousand herbs and grasses all fall short.
The golden toad, the jade crow—
Recognize true lead, and you are the master.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now many,
Blooming everywhere beyond the river of desire.
Hard to pluck, what can be done?
Step by step, tread the dragon-tiger’s den.
Returning with yellow blossoms to the cave,
Your name inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.
Laughing heartily, oh white clouds,
Prepare the celestial ladder to ascend the Great Loft.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now fragrant,
The lead cauldron warm, revealing its treasure’s glow.
On the golden bridge, gazing toward the winding river,
In the moon, the sun is clearly seen.
Swallow the black liver and hare’s marrow,
Replace the old dust-laden intestines.
The realm of fame and profit, the land of love and attachment—
Never again turn back, vainly busy.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now fresh,
Talisman fire sears mercury and lead.
At the furnace’s edge, the scene appears—
Gathering depends entirely on the dharma-boat.
A master craftsman, strong and steady, holds the helm,
Though the vast sea’s waves churn beneath.
Pass the three barriers, pierce the mud-pill,
Early on, open the nine apertures of the body.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now lush,
Recognize true lead as the primal ancestor.
Essence, qi, and spirit refined in one crucible,
The woman transforms to man, the old to youth.
To capture the White Tiger in the west,
First subdue the Azure Dragon in the east.
Of like kind, work diligently—
When the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now fair,
Heaven responds with stars, earth with tides.
The dragon-slaying sword, the tiger-binding rope,
Revolving the celestial stem, turning the Dipper’s handle.
Forging a furnace of true sun and moon,
Sweeping away the three thousand six hundred paths.
Treading the clouds, free and unfettered,
All sins and worldly dust vanish with a stroke.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now lofty,
Ocean waves surge as the moon plays with the tide.
The Silver River’s path pierces the nine heavens,
The raft’s shadow spans the void, moored to the Dipper’s handle.
Touching the Weaving Maid’s shuttle-stone,
Treading the Cowherd’s magpie bridge.
Meeting the immortals’ court, with bold spirit,
Stealing the Queen Mother’s peaches from Jasper Pool.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now paired,
Dragon and tiger ascend the altar, locked in battle.
Lead enters mercury, matching yin and yin,
The dharma-image of the mysterious pearl, priceless.
This is the true seed of the homeland,
Returning the old to youth, life everlasting.
Ascend to heaven, to the realm of utmost bliss,
Spared from the wheel of rebirth and meeting King Yama.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now wondrous,
Cultivated in the moon for but a moment.
Cloud-seizing hands, cloud-stepping ladder,
Plucking the first primordial branch.
Drinking wine with flowers, spirit refreshed,
Laughing at the drunken immortal, limp as mud.
Entrusting to a confidant, guarding with care,
Ever fearful the furnace’s fire may fly away.

The rootless tree, its flowers now golden,
Born in the central realm of wu and ji.
The eastern maiden, the western youth,
United as husband and wife in the bridal chamber.
Yellow Dame urges them to drink the ghee-like wine,
Daily intoxicated, ever drunk.
This immortal formula, this soul-returning nectar,
Raises the dead to life—truly the Medicine King.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now radiant,
The moon’s essence pressing upon the sun’s soul.
The golden crow’s marrow, the jade hare’s essence,
These two seized and simmered in one vessel.
Yang fire and yin tally divide at midnight and noon,
Bathing rites added at dawn and dusk’s gates.
Guard the Yellow Court, nurture the Valley Spirit,
A man conceiving—how the world will laugh!

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now crimson.
Plucked bare, the red blossoms leave the tree empty.
Emptiness is form, form is emptiness,
Discerning true emptiness within form.
When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes,
Yet the dharma-form endures, never falling into void.
Named Perfect Penetration, called the Great Hero,
Nine generations ascend beyond the nine heavens.

Again,
The rootless tree, its flowers now formless,
Shadowless, shapeless—hard to depict.
Nameless, yet answering when called,
Seized and placed within the alchemical furnace.
Circulate the samadhi fire of the celestial cycle,
Temper true emptiness to return to the Great Void.
Visit the immortal capital, receive the heavenly tally,
Only then is one a true man of courage.

*Daoist Airs of the Four Seasons*
Spring’s hues delight the heart,
Peach and apricot blossoms renew the eye.
The mountain garden’s fresh scenes,
Seem to banish all cares.
The immortal’s joy is to wander spring’s grotto-realm,
Master Zi Jin plays his jade flute,
The jade flute’s notes for the knowing ear.
I thought it mere idle pastime—
Lighting a stick of incense,
Stroking a tune upon the zither.

Summer’s delight—the lotus pond,
A pair of mandarin ducks skims the water’s face.
Arranged in mirrored pairs,
They drift with the cool breeze beneath the moon.
The immortal’s joy is Lü Dongbin’s meeting with Zhongli,
The two elders leaving behind the land of longevity,
Riding clouds to ascend Mount Zhongnan.
I thought it mere idle pastime—
Lighting a stick of incense,
Playing a game of chess.

Autumn’s scene—sparse clouds,
Distant peaks turn russet, trees shed their leaves.
Night reveals the Silver River’s spread,
Where the Herdsman ferries the Weaver Maid across.
The immortal’s joy is the fortune-teller’s retreat in Chengdu,
Master Junping carrying his jade flask,
Earning a hundred coins each day to buy wine.
I thought it mere idle pastime—
Lighting a stick of incense,
Reading a scroll of scripture.

Winter’s sight—snow flies,
A thousand miles of passes and mountains like jade heaped.
He Jing hides in his hut to sleep,
The cold sky, a crane guards Solitary Mountain.
The immortal’s joy is Han Xiangzi’s salvation of Wen Gong,
Though he urged him to turn back, he would not,
Only meeting again on the road to Blue Pass.
I thought it mere idle pastime—
Lighting a stick of incense,
Painting a plum tree in bloom.

*Four Daoist Airs*—composed in reclusion on Mount Zhongnan, sung for my own pleasure.
Styled after the *Bamboo Branch* songs, each stanza a sharp pause,
Seeming disjointed, yet the wonder lies precisely in the unbroken thread of disjunction.
Self-inscribed.
Left at Green Goat Palace, *Four Daoist Airs*.

Seeking old friends across the ends of earth—none to be found,
I sigh at those lost fools who would learn to be immortals.
Some cling to stubborn emptiness,
With yin but no yang, their refining is solitary;
Some wield crucibles and vessels,
Abandoning life and death to prattle of "gathering and battle."
Each grasps but one corner,
The Mysterious Pass unknown to them all.
Do not dress up non-action as adornment—
All is but an empty facade.
How to find cloud companions and rosy friends,
To blend with the world and harmonize its light for a few years?

To seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,
For the Primordial is what immortals transmit mouth-to-mouth,
And immortals but slumber amidst the flowers.

Again—
To refine millet-grain elixirs, one must have both method and resources,
And for matters of the heart, one must entrust two or three as companions.
How to find a Zhang Huanwei to discourse on the mysterious,
Or a Ma Banzhou to cultivate refinement together?
Xue Daoguang once returned to the secular,
Wang Chongyang was fortunate to meet a good fate.
Old Master Boduan sought friends in Fufeng County,
Bodhidharma attained the Dao in the Pavilion of Eternal Spring.
Only then did I realize that even the willow lanes and flower streets are fit for Chan meditation—
No more talk of pure non-action and idle sitting in vain.

To seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,
For the Primordial is what immortals transmit mouth-to-mouth,
And immortals but slumber amidst the flowers.

Again—
Seeking a true master with utmost diligence, countless times,
All claim to have received authentic transmission,
Some immortal and their dharma kin.
One speaks of replenishing the Upper Field,
Another of benefiting the Lower Origin.
One says guarding the Central Yellow is the Dharma-eye,
While others mock the space between the two kidneys as the Mysterious Pass.
With such a thousand gates and ten thousand doors,
Atop a hundred-foot pole,
Countless worthies have been led astray.

To seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,
For the Primordial is what immortals transmit mouth-to-mouth,
And immortals but slumber amidst the flowers.

Again—
Let those who would learn immortality heed my words:
Never blindly cultivate or recklessly refine.
You must know the inner and outer yin and yang,
And what kind of thing their kindred is.
One must refine yin and yang according to yin and yang,
And refine the worldly according to worldly methods.
Following the flow, one becomes human;
Reversing it, one becomes immortal—
A single phrase transcends thousands upon thousands.
No more talk of pure non-action—
Without obtaining the Returned Elixir, all is in vain.

To seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,
For the Primordial is what immortals transmit mouth-to-mouth,
And immortals but slumber amidst the flowers.

*Five Watches Daoist Airs*
**Note on Meaning:** *"Five Watches"* must be lived—it signifies unceasing effort, not that the first watch is one watch’s effort, the second two, and so on. The rest follow by analogy.

**First Watch**
Alone I herd the green ox at the first watch’s beginning,
Never letting it run wild or wander idly.
Here I shift scenes and alter moods,
Plucking flowers and breaking willows,
Secretly refining and cultivating in seclusion.
Closing the six gates, I guard in non-action and stillness,
Capturing the five thieves with methodical restraint.
Matching hardness and softness,
Enduring through spring and autumn,
Qi flourishes, spirit complete—
What worry is there in gathering the medicine?

**Again**
In the second watch, matching and harmonizing,
Dispelling all yin, driving back the demon horde.
I only wish to summon the phoenix to nest,
Call the turtle back to its cave,
And guide the tiger home to its den.
When lead arises, know to guard it carefully,
And when the moon appears, recognize it truly.
Do not err in action,
Lest the distant hour pass—
The Red Waters merge with the pearl,
And creation dances in joy!

**Again**
In the third watch, as the first yang stirs,
The gates of the Red County open,
And true qi begins to rise.
At this moment, lead’s splendor is faintly revealed,
First containing the jade bud,
Half-spitting golden essence.
Lock the heart-ape—dragons chant in response to clouds,
Tether the mind-horse—tigers roar as the wind rises.
Gather a sprig of magic fungus,
Send it into the Yellow Court,
Seal it without worry—
A hundred days’ work bears efficacy.

**Again**
In the fourth watch, the last drops of ghee are drunk,
Riding a raft like Zhang Qian,
Laughing at the sight of Magu.
Relying on this drop to irrigate the Three Fields,
Fusing and opening the hundred channels,
Moistening skin and flesh.
Circulating through the sturdy cauldron’s earthen pot,
Ascending and descending—guard as at first.
All thoughts vanish,
All sounds and sights are cast away.
Nurturing the fetal immortal—
Ten months’ work.

**Again**
At the fifth watch’s end, adding mercury and drawing lead,
Changing the crucible, dividing the elixir,
Moving the elixir to the Upper Field.
From now on, yang grows and yin wanes,
Nature is perfected, life is complete,
Body is firm, form is solid.
Quietly harmonizing the spirit, it gradually expands,
Diligently facing the wall—nine years to return to the origin.
Work complete, merit fulfilled,
Eight hundred and three thousand—
Uniting with the Dao as true,
One becomes an immortal.

**Five Watches Daoist Airs**

**First Watch**
Lead and mercury complete,
The Three Corpses and Six Thieves all scatter.
Heart-ape and mind-horse firmly tethered,
The lead crucible warm and never cold,
No demon dares lift its head.
Calm the spirit, let nature take its course,
The dragon chants, the tiger rejoices.
Mastering this wondrous principle through practice,
Fire and water throughout the body pair as Li and Kan.
To become immortal or sage—what lament is there?
To achieve longevity is not difficult.
I recall the *Fire Dragon’s Direct Pointers* to the Returned Elixir,
Carefree and at ease—
At ease, an immortal.

**Again**
In the second watch, the elixir edict arrives,
Riding dragons and phoenixes beyond the spring clouds.
The Great Return is at hand—everyone cherishes it,
At last believing the golden elixir is fine medicine.
Mother sees her darling child in one embrace,
Peacefully asleep, feigning dullness.
In the realm of purity, unstained by dust,
From now on, all karmic debts are extinguished.
Becoming one who never ages,
Nurturing peach-cheeked and apricot-faced youth.

**Again**
In the third watch, the living Zi hour,
The immortal’s fair scene appears in the Flowery Pond.
The spirit turtle drinks the golden crow’s marrow,
The elixir phoenix brings the jade hare’s fat.
Mysterious bright wine—
Drunk as if mad,
All yin gone, the radiant yang season.
A branch of golden spring blossoms,
The fair one’s heart inclined, consenting,
The young lord delights in mutual play.
Having met the return to origin and reversion to root,
Lifespan equals heaven’s.

**Again**
In the fourth watch, the night watch deepens,
After lead arises from Gui, yin and yang part.
Just at the first string, the golden water is full,
Like the oriole and flowers of a second-month spring.
No greed for wealth,
No love for fame.

Drinking nectar of jade,
Listening to celestial music.
The azure sky merges with the pristine clear waves,
Before the Hall of Void-White, the steed of intent is tethered,
Beneath the shadowless tree, the monkey of the heart is locked.
Three cycles and nine revolutions—the true person appears,
Having met the primordial Great Dao,
Lifespan rivals heaven and earth.

**Again**
In the fifth watch, having gathered it,
Fame and fortune are all cast aside.
With whole heart longing for Penglai’s scene,
The Ten Isles and Three Mountains become home.
Free from the fire of desire,
Without entanglements,
This longevity
Lies within oneself.
Nurture gratitude for parental kindness, never falter,
Meet others without speaking of hardship,
Fear neither blade nor beast.
Though alluring beauty hangs her curtain,
Never again yearn for wayward blossoms or wall-side willows.

**Five Watches’ Daoist Songs**

**First Watch**
Entering the meditation chamber,
Body and mind in purity—no need for haste,
The heart’s monkey and intent’s steed must not be lightly released.
Guard the spirit terrace’s white jade light,
Within it hides the idle true person.
The master sits upright atop Kunlun,
The Yellow Dame leads into the bridal chamber.
Infant boy and maiden girl pair as one,
The three families meet by Qujiang’s winding shore.

**Again**
**Second Watch**
Ascending the meditation mat,
Contemplating parents before birth,
The original face ever appears.
Gathering the primordial to mend the later heaven,
The three passes revolve to the Mud Pill Palace.
Divine water of the Flowery Pond frequently swallowed,
Water and fire unite to warm the lower field.
Within the crescent moon crucible, the supreme treasure simmers,
Three cycles and nine revolutions refine the elixir.

**Again**
**Third Watch**
As the first yang arises,
Kan and Li consummate their marriage,
Free from entanglements, ever pure.
The mud ox from the sea’s depths surges straight upward,
Unbroken qi threads through Kunlun.
The gold-water couple comes to union,
White snow of immortality abides in the Yellow Court.
Having refined the golden elixir, the indestructible body,
Only then is the mystery of the mysterious pass fully known.

**Again**
**Fourth Watch**
Seeking the ancestral wind,
The great meaning from the West lies within,
Constantly applying effort.
The bright moon hangs in the sky, red to the crown,
Illuminating one’s own master.
Only then knowing lead cast into mercury within the crucible,
The true lineage appears within the exquisite pagoda.
The golden elixir refined, true emptiness achieved,
For a thousand years, ten thousand ages, the body remains unmoved.

**Again**
**Fifth Watch**
Aligning with heaven’s mechanism,
The aperture of the mysterious pass—few know it,
Who recognizes the realm of life and death?
All relies on wu-ji to birth the infant,
Golden light resplendent, the Muni appears.
The supreme treasure gathered within the cinnabar field,
Nurturing the spiritual root to equal heaven.
The yang spirit’s wondrous form merges with the Great Void,
A single grain of millet pearl encompasses heaven and earth.

**Five Watches’ Daoist Songs**
In stillness observing faces and images,
Searching for the root of the Dao’s aperture.
Within the Taiyi crucible, the celestial circuit revolves,
The true fire of samadhi forges and refines.
Arrows pierce the iron drum of the nine kings,
The three passes revolve to the Mud Pill Palace.
Grasping the precious moon to pair with the sun’s slumber,
At this moment, lead and mercury meet.

*To the tune of "Moon over the West River."*
This is an ancient immortal’s song, borrowed by the patriarch as the prelude to *Five Watches’ Daoist Songs*, hence preserved as is.

**First Watch**
The steed steady—let not the monkey leap.
Qi settled, spirit clear,
The heart’s ground naturally swept.
Guarding the Yellow Court,
Revolving the primordial Dao.
In tranquil leisure observing,
The mystery within the mystery revealed.
Seizing the moment when the heart is stilled,
Nature abides at heaven’s edge, life at the sea’s bottom—
Awakening to the bronze mirror.

Bronze mirror,
Formless, radiant, hard as iron.
Look at yourself,
Transforming heaven and earth,
Gathering the sun’s essence—
All heed
The Dharma King’s decree.

**Again**
**Second Watch**
Within the crucible, myriad lotus blossoms bloom.
The yellow sprout refined,
A single point descends from heaven.
Drawing life from death,
Formless yet possessing form.
Illuminating the ten directions,
Everywhere resplendent.
Behold the celestial channel, bright and gleaming,
Herding the flock, clapping hands in laughter,
Early leaping over Cloud Dream.

Leaping over Cloud Dream,
Feet stomping the spirit terrace, crying aloud.
Look at yourself,
Holding the golden tablet,
Inscribing your name—
Having attained
The effortless Dao.

**Again**
**Third Watch**
Regulating with towering stillness, utterly unmoved.

A lone pillow in solitary sleep,
Piercing the dream of millet’s golden steam.
The white crow arrives at dawn,
The Great Ultimate’s cavern radiant and bright.
The seas run dry,
Each pearl played in hand.
Purple Yang Palace stands alone, leafing through profit,
Wandering idly in the Crystal Palace’s halls.
What fine Nine-Ranked Land of No-Birth—
The Great Marshal’s hall lined with vajras.

Look at yourself,
Climbing heaven’s ladder—
How to know
The coral stone,
True lapis lazuli?

**Again**
**Fourth Watch**
With fierce courage, battling the demon king.
In the Formless Palace,
Wielding the double-tailed sword.
Vanquishing the demon king,
Ten thousand leagues become one expanse.
Body and form unbound,
Entering Penglai’s courts once more.
Who knows this news?
You ponder and laugh to yourself.
What wondrous mystery within the mystery—
A single set of chess pieces clamoring on the board.

Look at yourself,
Pawns and advisors,
Cannons arrayed,
Chariots and horses advancing,
Checkmate in sight.

**Again**
**Fifth Watch**
Just awakened, self-aware, the heart unfolds in realization.
Swiftly redouble efforts,
Advance another step beyond the peak.
Rushing to Purple Yang Palace,
Breaking through the Caoxi path.
These labors—
No need to speak of them lightly.
Lifting the golden visage, grasping the sword’s hilt,
Keep it sealed, let nothing leak.
Unleashing the dragons to wrestle,
Dragons wrestle—
Do not let the lambs grow hungry and thin.

Look at yourself,
Vigilant on the dike,
Thieves do not steal,
The guard has wandered off—
Awaiting the celestial cycle.

**Fifth Watch’s Daoist Ballad**
The Yellow River’s current reversed in a single flow,
Nurtured to tenderness, soft as an infant child.

If mortals ask of the path to longevity,
Laugh and point east to Penglai beyond the azure sea.

**First Watch**
Cultivation demands meticulous care—
Do not let the mind-steed gallop east and west,
Gallop east and west.
The gibbon is locked within the square inch of the heart,
While this old master rides the black ox.
One more phrase—
The rest follows likewise.
The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as one,
The precious sword plunged into the furnace.
Dragon and tiger entwine,
Kan and Li unite,
Water and fire inverted to achieve completion.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* the Buddha of the primordial chaos,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.
Blossom’s bloom, leaf’s fall—
The moment when yang arises and yin expires.
Were it a mundane flower,
The bloom would bring forth leaves as well.
The rest follows likewise.

**Again**
**First Watch**
Cultivation lifts the true thought,
At the crossroads, refine the golden elixir,
Refine the golden elixir.
No need for water, fire, or charcoal—
Only awakening through seated meditation.
The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as two,
The Yellow Dame leads the infant away.
Ascend to the Mud Pill Palace,
Pierce the Mysterious Pass—
Infant and maiden unite in harmony.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Śākyamuni Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Second Watch**
Cultivation demands unity,
Maiden and infant stand on either side,
Stand on either side.
The Yellow Lord and Yellow Dame serve as matchmakers,
Binding the two families in karmic ties.
The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as three,
Speaking of life and death is no difficulty—
Yet though it seems not difficult,
It lies not here but there.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* the Tathāgata of the Western Paradise,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Second Watch**
Cultivation demands single-minded focus,
Hand gripping the shadowless sword,
The shadowless sword.

**Third Watch**
The Six Thieves rush to the Demon King’s hall,
The Three Corpses’ heads roll before one’s eyes.
The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as four—
Now I meet my enlightened teacher,
Who points me down a single path,
Hour by hour, moment by moment, I apply the work.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Maitreya, the Laughing Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Third Watch**
Cultivation demands vigilance against peril,
Let not the Six Thieves sway you,
Sway you.
Gather qi, condense spirit—all sinks downward.
Burn paper money to send them away.

The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as five—
Now I have mastered the work.
Gather the primordial,
Mend the later heaven,
Rolling forth beyond the Cloud Gate to the heavens beyond heavens.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Cundi, the Guiding Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Third Watch**
Cultivation must not leak the mechanism,
The Yellow River reverses its flow, ascending the heavenly ladder,
Ascending the heavenly ladder.
Stand firm at the Mysterious Pass on the Black Ox’s hoof,
Inverting and inverting, fill *li* with *kan*.

The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as six—
The lion refines the fire monkey.
Now I think,
To wander the clouds,
Crossing the *jiazi* cycle to reach Yingzhou.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* the Eighteen Arhats,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Fourth Watch**
Cultivation demands wholehearted devotion,
Light the lamp of wisdom in the twin trees’ grove,
Light the lamp of wisdom.
Illuminating the World-Honored One’s departure,
Wait for him before the gates of the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as seven—
Someone in the void lends a hand.
Ride the Black Ox,
Cross the Mysterious Pass,
Refining a golden elixir, round and whole.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Dipamkara, the Ancient Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Fourth Watch**
Cultivation demands diligence,
Watch for the *xun* wind rising from the southwest,
Rising from the southwest.
Water and fire in harmony, inverted in use,
The medicine and fire together enter the furnace.

The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as eight—
The infant and maiden flourish in splendor.
The master,
Recognizing them,
Forge them into one—this is the true adept.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Mahāpakṣa, the Golden-Winged Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Fifth Watch**
Cultivation—the golden rooster crows,
The deluded do not walk this path,
This path.
The iron tree blooms, its pistils not few,
When complete, it naturally has root and branch.

The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as nine—
Speaking of it, everyone possesses it.
Speaking of possession, yet it is not,
Speaking of absence, yet it is—
This debate never ends.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Mahāmāyūrī, the Peacock Radiant Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

**Again**
**Fifth Watch**
Cultivation—the sun crimson,
Beware lest the fire-timing come to naught,
Come to naught.
A thousand rays of rosy light surge like golden lotuses,
When complete, success is natural.

The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as ten—
Now I return home.
Seeing the master,
Smiling,
I ask, “Where is the true person?”

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Dīrgha-karṇa, the Long-Eared Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

The recitations of the five watches end at dawn,
In the east, the first blush of peach-red appears,
The first blush of peach-red.
East rising, west setting—hurrying mortals to old age,
Avoiding the three disasters to repay the teacher’s kindness.

The golden elixir’s blossom is drawn as eleven—
Now I come to the deep mountains.
Erect a thatched hut,
Taming dragons and subduing tigers—naturally at ease.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful recitation:
Recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Amitābha Buddha,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

The recitations of the five watches conclude in radiant clarity,
A single crimson light—this is the ultimate truth.
The Yellow Dragon pierces through the Three Passes’ summit,
Today, riding the crane, I ascend in flight.

The golden elixir’s twelve blossoms open as one,
The Jade Emperor’s cinnabar script arrives.
Donning immortal robes,
Transforming upon the lotus dais,
The golden body is refined—imperishable.

Recite, recite once the name of the Buddha,
*Namo* Amitāyus, the Buddha of Infinite Life,
*Namo* the blossom’s bloom, the leaf’s fall.

Though the *Nine Watches* are not nine in time,
This is named “Nine Watches” (*geng*, falling tone),
Speaking of the repeated refinement
To complete the nine revolutions’ count.

The gate that gives me life is the path that takes my death,
How many are truly awake? How many truly awaken?
Last night, the iron man reflected alone—
Long life and immortality are made by man.

This verse belongs to Ancestor Zhong,
Also cited by the Patriarch to begin the *Nine Watches*.

**First Watch**
Turn the heart toward goodness,
For life and death are truly arduous.
Since departing the ancient Vulture Peak,
At the primal chaos’ first division, descending to the world.
In the West, there was a root,
Abandoned, its origin lost.
Coming to the Eastern Land,
Nature and life fell into the mundane.
Lost was
The Old Mother’s state before birth.

**Second Watch**
In the years of growing to adulthood,
Roots and sprouts take hold in the city’s midst.
Hunger and thirst teach up from down,
Yet none know whence life and death arise!
Dwelling in the second chamber,
Truth and falsehood remain unrecognized.
No path of escape is cultivated,
Only the present moment is heeded.
Following the six thieves,
The master of the house is ruined.

**Third Watch**
Banish thoughts of lust and waywardness,
Firmly lock the intent-horse and mind-ape.
In streets of flowers and willows, curb desire,
Lest another’s wife or daughter become your kin.
All is broken precepts,
All is demonic entanglement.
Two ghosts come to beckon—
Dare not turn to look back.
Entering hell’s gates,
Then the Tathāgata’s face will be hard to see.

**Fourth Watch**
Wisdom and folly are hard to discern,
Only the awakened see through the snare.
Behold how worldly men do not endure,
A hundred years of light pass swift as arrows.
Turn back early,
For this is the prime of life.
Seek a radiant teacher,
Receive the oral transmission,
That you may be shown
The original face before your mother’s birth.

**Fifth Watch**
Take refuge in the Tathāgata,
Sever the bonds of love for life and death.
Seeing worldly affairs stirs sorrow,
Lest one incur the debt of rebirth.
Lock the mind-ape fast,
Lest it be harmed.
Raise the true thought,
Boundless and without limit.
Ride the fragrant breeze,
Return home in good time.

**Sixth Watch**
Examine closely your original lineage,
Confine the ape and monkey within the chamber.
Whether coming or going, do not relax,
Guard the deep palace day and night with sword in hand.
Lock the four gates,
Suppress the demonic winds.
See through the red dust,
All is but emptiness.
Master of the house,
Recite the true scripture ceaselessly.

**Seventh Watch**
To shed the dust of the world,
Rely on the guidance of the gracious teacher.
Uphold the Three Regulations and Five Precepts,
Vow resolutely never to break them.
Worldly matters are small,
The matter of life and death is great.
Sever the cycle of rebirth,
Become indestructible as vajra.
Amidst the surging waves,
A single white lotus appears.

**Eighth Watch**
Guard the true lead,
Amitābha sits inverted at the mysterious pass.
Inhalation and exhalation of primordial yang revolve up and down,
Three before and three behind, borne as one.
The Yellow River flows backward,
The mud ox plows the field.
The magpie’s nest crowns the head,
Golden lotuses rise from the earth.
Atop Mount Sumeru,
A ray of numinous light shines forth.

**Ninth Watch**
Refine the three families with bitter toil,
The furnace’s fire never errs.
Beneath the shadowless tree, golden flowers bloom,
The two words *nature* and *life* branch forth at both ends.
Three carts transport,
Zhaozhou pours the tea.
Journey to the West,
Pay homage to the Buddha’s family.
The little infant,
Laughs with joy upon seeing its mother.

**Seven Laments on Leaving the Household Life**
These seven *Laments on Leaving the Household Life* have often been appropriated by Daoist priests as their own, and some suspect them to be the work of Luo Hongxian—this is not so. The final piece states: *"Fifty-two lines of mystery within principle, / Clearly and plainly spoken for you,"* referring to the *Daoist Songs*. From this, it is evident they were undoubtedly transmitted by Master Feng. Further examination of Wang’s edition confirms this.

**First Lament**
Leaving the household—how strange!
Seeing through the world’s path, as distant as cloud and mud.
With a heart unstained by worldly affairs,
Let others chase fleeting fame and profit,
Let others cling to beloved children and fair wives.
Toil of form is not worth remaining—
How could I spend my days in ceaseless striving?
How could I waste my days in endless scheming?
In cultivation, one must resolve with soaring ambition,
Become a man of noble spirit,
Shatter the mechanism of life and death,
Free from vexation, sorrow, and care.

**Second Lament**
Leaving the household—how secluded!
Cutting off deluded thoughts and worries.
How can one live without worldly dust?
How could I seek profit and covet gain?
How could I idly give up?
Resolutely, I will not fall into impermanence’s grasp,
Vowing to seek a teacher,
Vowing to pursue true cultivation.
Naturally, there will come a day when the elixir is perfected,
Then I may ride a crane or sail a boat,
Then I may wander at leisure,
Who has fathomed the wondrous mystery of the true Dao?

**Third Lament**
Leaving the household—how profound!
Learning to borrow the false to refine the true.
In movement and stillness, sitting and walking, fix the true heart,
Cherishing the nurturing of qi and uplifting of spirit,
Delighting in wood descending and metal ascending.
The numinous light appears, round as a mirror,
In an instant, every aperture becomes spiritually attuned.
The Yellow River’s waters revolve around Kunlun,
Naturally, one recognizes the true transformation of mystery.

**Fourth Lament**
Leaving the household—how abstruse!
Seeing through seated meditation and Chan inquiry.
What thing is the master that appears?
Within the mystery, silently wordless,
In motion and stillness, adding mercury and drawing lead.
Like a fool, like a drunkard, yet the spirit never tires.
When stoking the fire, civil and martial contend,
When nurturing, after midnight and before noon,
Water and fire conjoin in mutual refinement.

**Fifth Lament**
Leaving the household—how refined!
Prepare as a mighty general and valiant soldier.

**Sixth Lament**
Guard against the Six Thieves’ pilfering,
Let them ride mists or soar on clouds,
Let them be battle-hardened and fierce in strife—
All are subdued by wondrous skill.
Raise the Eye of Wisdom, ten thousand steeds charge as one,
Grasp the Sword of Wisdom, sever demonic essence.
The Three Corpses yield, the Demon King submits,
Revealing a heart of red loyalty and devotion.
Naturally, one sees a prosperous nation and a peaceful people,
With a single battle, all is settled in tranquility.

**Seventh Lament**
Leaving the household—how lofty!
One learns a life of ease and carefree wandering,
Embracing reversal and inversion, penetrating the mysterious and wondrous.
A single meal—how much can one eat?
Three cups of wine, and the face blooms like a peach of immortality,
Laughing through the streets of flowers and willows.
A small gourd always hangs at the waist,
A few packets of the Ten-Thousand-Spirits Elixir carried along,
Everywhere offering convenience to others.
When fortune smiles, fine wine and delicacies,
When times are lean, water and a simple gourd.
Wealth and poverty, honor and lowliness—all shaped by Heaven.
Let others don purple robes,
Let others ride steeds adorned with golden sable.
In the blink of an eye, impermanence arrives,
A three-inch breath grows faint and fleeting,
A household wails and clamors—
What care is given to filial sons or worthy grandsons?
In the end, cultivating the Dao is supreme,
Prolonging life, dispelling illness, and dissolving calamities.
Free from worry, free from care, free from vexation,
Awaiting the hour to ascend on clouds,
To join the Eight Immortals and cross the Immortal Bridge,
Only then is the mystery within the mystery revealed.

**Eighth Lament**
Leaving the household—how true!
The source of the heart must be cleansed to purity.
Only then is the principle within the mystery made clear,
Yet who inquires into refining the true and nurturing nature?
I have traversed rugged mountains and towering peaks,
Wandered through prefectures, counties, and cities,
Blending with the bustle of markets and crowds.
Some avoid meat and abstain from lust,
Some bear insults with magnanimity, keeping wealth and principle distinct,
Honored as friends in the lands of the southwest.
Once, I too was drunk on the world’s ways, dazed and confused,
But with sober eyes, I see the four seas’ teeming multitudes,
The red dust churning, golden blossoms tender.
Who in this world truly recognizes the moon at the edge of the sky?
Which affair in this world is ever made clear?
Yet each clings to the aspiration of cultivating immortality.
Fifty-two verses of mystery within the mystery,
Spoken plainly and clearly for you.
Seek a radiant teacher, visit the lofty,
With earnest devotion, one may receive the gift of longevity.

**The Moon at the Edge of the Sky (Nine Songs of Daoist Sentiment, Taking "The Moon at the Edge of the Sky Emerges from Geng" as Its Meaning)**

**I**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light bright,
Illuminating the world as if through an overturned basin,
How many enmities lie hidden beneath that overturned basin?
Through kalpas of cultivation, one gains a human form,
Lose it, and for ten thousand kalpas it is hard to find again,
Hard to find the Eight Jewels of True Suchness.
Clinging to wife and children, like sheep among wolves,
Boasting of wealth and power, bullying the poor.
Yet Heaven’s retribution awaits those who bully the poor—
Better to leap free of the red dust,
Seek a radiant teacher, and early embark on cultivation,
Only then will one have a share among the immortals.

**II**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light dim,
Who would cease clinging to glory and splendor?
Without ceasing, how can the conditions for immortality converge?
Alas, worldly folk, moored to a lone boat,
Like bubbles afloat on water,
Once scattered, they are hard to reassemble.
Better to turn back early,
Seek a radiant teacher, reverse-ride the green ox,
Accumulate merit and deeds until the elixir is formed,
In times of steadfastness, wander the four seas,
In times of fulfillment, step onto Penglai Isle,
Only then will one’s name be inscribed on the golden memorial.

**III**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light cold,
To become an immortal is not so difficult,
Not difficult—if one but slays the Three Corpses.
The Alms Bowl for Subduing Dragons, passed down through generations,
The Vessel for Taming Tigers, its wondrous secrets hard to speak,
Hard to speak—do not reveal them to the unworthy.
Great spiritual powers plant lotuses in fire,
A master craftsman poles a boat against the current,
Poles against the current—do not falter.
The master steers the sail,
Amidst crashing waves, gathers true lead,
Only then does one ascend to the Hall of Numinous Dawn.

**IV**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light high,
An immortal crosses the Magpie Bridge,
Yet the Magpie Bridge’s path is perilous, hard to reach.
From the Palace of the Yellow Court, one gathers the sprouts of medicine,
Within the Silver River, the tides of water rise,
Only then is the mystery within the mystery revealed.
The Cowherd descends from the heavenly courts,
The Weaver Girl eagerly beckons,
Cowherd and Weaver Girl share their joy.
May Heaven bestow a Yellow Matron,
For a blessed union in the realm of the indistinct,
When merit is complete and deeds fulfilled, the celestial decree arrives.

**V**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light solitary,
The cultivator—a true man.
Only a true man enters the path of cultivation,
The Immortal Maiden Zhang once paid homage to Ancestor Lü.
The Dragon Girl offered a precious pearl,
The pearl summoned the protection of Chang’e.
From the Palace of Muddy Pellet, nectar descends,
Like pearl-orange wine, the finest ghee,
Ghee that, upon the tongue, is like sweet dew.
Advance the fire of yang, retreat the tally of yin,
Enter the Cinnabar Field, seal it firmly,
Only then will the path to Heaven be opened.

**VI**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light drifting,
An immortal plays a jade flute,
The jade flute’s notes open the heavenly apertures.
Heaven and Earth in harmony, unmoving and unshaken,
Inversion and reversal—one must raise the hand high,
Only then is the mystery within the mystery revealed.
White snow swirls up to the Ninth Heaven,
Yellow sprouts grow long into numinous shoots,
Who knows the subtleties of the primordial mystery?
The rolling pearl is hard to depict, hard to describe,
The Hall of Mañjuśrī stands firm and unyielding,
Only then does one repay the teacher’s kindness.

**VII**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light low,
The eighteen disciples play with the Mañjuśrī,
Mañjuśrī enters the land of longevity.
The meaning of the Western Advent is like drunkenness, like folly,
Avalokiteśvara, pure and without action,
Yet from non-action arises wondrous function.
Lead merges with mercury, life spans match Heaven’s,
Water and fire conjoin, forever secure,
The Three Corpses cower, the Demon King flees.
The Elixir of Longevity needs no cup,
Sweet as honey, one drinks the measured dose,
Intoxicated, one departs for the Feast of Peaches.

**VIII**
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light full,
Beneath the ancient pine, one awakens to the true mystery,
The true mystery—only the self may see.
Phoenixes soar over lofty mountains,
Parrots sing, guarding the Muddy Pellet,
Within the Muddy Pellet, the Infant’s face appears.
Holding the moon’s essence, neither ahead nor behind,
Embracing the sun in slumber, without earth or sky.

The Heavenless becomes the Palace of Exquisite Clarity,
May Heaven bestow a wisp of pure mist,
Embracing millet grains to ascend the cloud’s edge,
Only then may one approach the Hall of Divine Radiance.

Again,
The moon at the edge of the sky, its light gone,
Formless and shapeless, hard to depict,
Depictions hard to enter the manuals of cultivation.
Nameless, yet one hears the call,
Formless, who discerns near and far?
The wondrous function of kinship remains wholly concealed.
In thoughtless moments, what need for effort?
In the absence of desire, the true nature is thus,
Only thus is the path of one’s birth mother.
In the formless realm lies the true Way,
In freedom from entanglement, the immortal capital,
Only then may one tread upon the colored clouds.

*Twelve Songs of the Sweeping Light*

The sweeping light,
Illuminating the true,
Clap—one’s breast brims with spring.
Jade is not treasure, pearls are not precious,
The road to Mount Bei Mang does not follow the body.
All that has form and shape is false,
Only the scentless and soundless is true.
The body is not the Dao, the Dao is not the mind,
Do not mistake body and mind for the true person.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the lord,
Beneath flowers and moonlight, drunk and reeling.
Words are not script, learning is not literature,
The Lord of the East laughs at one’s meager knowledge.
Peach red, willow green, plum blossoms white,
Swept away in an instant, no need for reflection.
People bustle, things teem,
Yet none differ—one transcends the crowd.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the emperor,
The mechanism of divine transformation suddenly aligns.
Fish leap of themselves, kites soar of themselves,
Creation’s calculations are never concealed!
Qi transforms, form arises from its primal sign,
A single point of harmonious balance returns to the root.
Encompassing emptiness, giving birth to Heaven and Earth,
At a glance, all matters become effortless.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the master,
Suddenly, the path of arrival is seen with clarity.
By land, one rides a carriage; by water, a boat,
Yet without moving a step, one reaches paradise.
In an instant, the principle is most true,
Ascending to the sacred realm—no words are amiss.
Without peering through the window, without stepping beyond the door,
One grasps all under Heaven with certainty.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating life,
A single point of harmonious balance, the essence of the Two and Five.
Nature is principle, destiny is feeling,
The wondrous function of intermingling qi coalesces at once.
When deluded, seeking it leads to error at every turn,
Once awakened, grasping it makes every place divine.
Death follows death, life follows life,
Cultivation depends on planting, ruin on collapse.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the numinous,
Morning roams, evening rests in the Pavilion of Exquisite Clarity.
Awake, one is at peace; asleep, one is at peace,
When spring arrives, no place is not verdant.
To attain wisdom, one need not listen to the zither,
To brighten the eyes, one must read the wordless scripture.
Neither vague nor obscure,
Ever at peace, ever still, ever vigilant.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the One,
One penetrates, one completes, one returns to the One.
The sage is One, the worthy is One,
Heaven and Earth, the myriad things—none are not One.
The hundred cares of the world all converge in One,
The diverse paths of the world all return to the One.
The immortal is One, the ordinary is One,
One resolves all—naturally simple and easy.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the heart,
Confucian texts, Buddhist scriptures, immortal classics.
All are superfluous growths, mere excrescences,
Each expounding its own Dao.
To devise diagrams and symbols is a vain effort,
Clever metaphors and roundabout explanations are but idle chatter.
Do not cling to traces, do not adhere to words,
Such is the person who embodies the spirit and illuminates it.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating clarity—
At the dawn of primordial chaos, where were the written words?
The Qin burned books, the Han annotated scriptures,
Annotations perished, burned books endured.
Transmission from heart to mouth, instruction through texts,
All stir up trouble where none need exist.
No robe, no bowl, no sword, no zither,
Only then is one a person unstained by even a speck of dust.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating immortals—
Know now that "penetration" is but a forced term.
Apertures are not wondrous, the Mysterious Female is not profound,
Neither water nor fire, neither mercury nor lead.
No "Limitless" merging with "Great Ultimate,"
No "Prior Heaven" nor "Posterior Heaven."
Nature returns to life, life returns to Heaven,
Returning to life is returning to the root, to chaos before its division.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the Buddha—
Know that on the other shore, there is no Buddha.
Buddha is not mind, mind is not Buddha,
Vainly one keeps fasts and chants the name of Maitreya.
Do not mistake Vulture Peak for the Buddha’s land,
Beyond Vulture Peak lies another Buddha.
Perfectly round, radiantly bright,
This one move is what a thousand sages do not transmit.

Again,
The sweeping light,
Illuminating the sage—
A single mirror piercing Heaven and Earth.
Stillness within movement, movement within stillness,
All things flow unimpeded, none encroach upon another.
Flowers bloom and fall, the earth remains chaste,
Clouds come and go, the sky stays ever pure.
Rightness and greatness in light, light in rightness and greatness,
Divided yet able to unite, settled yet able to respond.

*To the tune of "Partridge Sky"*
To conquer demons, first conquer the demon of sleep,
This is the foremost whip in cultivation.
Endure one night’s hardship now,
And a thousand years of sun and moon will turn within your pot.

In foundational work, resolve must be firm,
Rely on the Mysterious Female to seek the Mysterious within the Mysterious.
Spirit returns, qi restores—elixir body forms,
Then open the furnace to refine the lead.

*Daoist Ballad at the Fifth Watch*
At the first watch,
All things cease,
Shake off torpor, sit at the bedside.
Steadfast and unmoving, the master guards,
In the crescent-moon furnace, the golden sprout stirs,
Within the forest of seven treasures, the true fluid flows,
True yang strikes through the three barriers in an instant.
In a moment, water and fire achieve harmony,
Irrigating the Mud Pill Palace, descending the Tower of Nine Stories.

At the second watch,
The heart must stand firm,
The Three Corpses and gods appear before you.
The seven emotions and six desires come to temper you,
Now wield the Azure Blade sword,
Ride backward on the white ox to ascend the mountain,
The yang spirit goes forth to battle the yin soldiers.
In a moment, water and fire achieve harmony,
In an instant, the three barriers are struck through.

---

At the third watch,
Hold fast to practice,
Gather the primordial—
The hare meets the hawk.
Within the profound darkness comes true sign,
Lead and mercury unite in the crucible and tripod,
Draw from Kan to fill Li, enter the inner court,
The Yellow Dame directs with intent to guide them.
In a moment, water and fire achieve harmony,
In the sixth month, ice forms at the well’s bottom.

---

At the fourth watch,
Apply diligent effort,
Raise high the lamp of wisdom.
Only then can tiger and dragon be firmly seized,
Zi Yang’s dual cultivation of nature and life,
Scattered, it becomes qi; gathered, it takes form,
The true person recognizes the nine returns and seven reversals.
In a moment, water and fire achieve harmony,
Retreat the yin tally to refine the yang spirit.

---

At the fifth watch,
Do not slacken,
Drive the white ox
Up the mountain.
The infant emerges to see the bright pearl appear,
A single grain of golden elixir, like a pearl’s gleam,
Gathered and released, it moves as it will.
The corpse-thief is locked in the Palace of Empty Kings.
In a moment, water and fire achieve harmony,
A hundred days’ work transforms the old into a youthful face.

*Mysterious Questions and Answers*
A hand-copied manuscript by a Daoist adept contains two self-posed and self-answered exchanges by Master Sanfeng, most profound. Some believe these were Emperor Yongle’s distant inquiries, to which the Master responded from afar—another plausible account.

Within it appears the question:
*"You, Daoist, open your mouth and speak of the Dao—then tell me: in this breath, who gathers and who seals it? Who lifts and who raises? Before father and mother were born, where did that single spark of true yang move and rest? Where did it cultivate its root and nourish its stem? Where did it establish life and settle its foundation? Give me the primordial sound, clarify this principle—take care not to speak in muddled confusion!"*

The answer follows:
That Daoist bowed deeply and replied: *"Look at me—this breath gathers and seals itself, lifts and raises itself. Before father and mother were born, that single spark of true yang moved and rested within the Void, cultivated its root and nourished its stem within the Void, established life and settled its foundation within the Void. This is the primordial sound I speak, the principle I clarify—why point east and guess west!"*

*The Cloud-Water Former Collection* comprises works composed by our Master Sanfeng during the Yuan and Ming dynasties. In the Yongle era, Hu Guang and others included it within the *Great Compendium*, and few copies circulated in the world. During the Jiajing reign, an imperial edict sought medical and esoteric texts, and this work was reprinted from the *Great Compendium* and distributed to state preceptors and others. In the fifty-ninth year of Kangxi’s reign, Xiling obtained this edition from a bookshop in Yangzhou and treasured it as a prized possession—the very copy once held in Huagu’s library. Should one arise in later times to reprint these blocks, they will surely transmit the Master’s person, allow readers to savor his poetry, and recognize his pure breeze and lofty integrity as beyond compare.

*Inscribed extemporaneously for Dream-Nine, Prefect of Da’e*
An immortal clerk from the celestial bureaus,
A great recluse come to the human realm.
For the people you pray for rain to descend—
On what day will you ride the wind home?
Stones lie as if toward Penglai’s peaks,
Peaches planted in the gardens of Lang.
When your work is done, how fine to return,
To refine your spirit-terraces early and well.

*Attending the Western Pool Immortal Assembly*
The Ten Continents and Three Isles gather heroes,
Riding cranes and phoenix-chariots to the azure city.
Sword and sash chime as jade towers recede,
Incense smoke curls around conch-palace halls.
In the golden palace, golden registers unfurl,
Before the white-jade hall, jade flutes resound.
A million pearls illuminate the chamber—
Cultivating the body, one rejoices in long life.

*Come from Beyond the Heavens*
Come from beyond the heavens, come from beyond the heavens,
Robes and cap unstained by dust.
Crane’s back turns clouds through empty cosmos,
Dragon’s breath sprays springs as rain from mountain crags.

*Small as Emei, Thunder Gate*
Roaming wilds, entering cloud-roots,
Green pines alone seal the grotto gate.
Stone cliffs pour a thousand-foot cascade,
The Daoist sits in clarity, warming the fishing ledge.

*Again*
Deep in white clouds, wandering idly,
Iron flute blown across peaks with sound.
Woodcutters seek me but cannot find—
Transformed into an ancient stone immortal.

*Visiting Dream-Nine’s Stone Hall by the Stream at Pure Radiance Lodge*
Green shade veils the gate of the Daoist’s home,
Incense smoke drifts on the wind in a slender thread.
In the grotto, wine’s fragrance flows like bamboo leaves,
By the stream, spring has passed, scattering peach blossoms.
Only our kind retain ever-youthful faces,
Even if dust and curtains veil the world.
Here, heaven and earth are truly different—
In the mountains, try driving a five-cloud chariot.

*Joyful Chant*
Joyful, joyful, joyful—beyond red dust.
Leisurely, leisurely, leisurely—amid white clouds.
Wondrous, wondrous, wondrous—a pine cliff’s single cry.
Come, come, come—lotus isle flowers bloom.

*On Stone Chamber Mountain, Inscribed in All-Oblique Pentameter*
All day seated in the stone chamber,
Ancient grotto naturally still.
Bamboo hides ten thousand shoots,
Green path sees few visitors.
Birdsong calls midday,
Qi stills toward emerald cliffs.
Stepping beyond the water’s ravine,
Deer-pace rustles fallen leaves.
Suddenly seeing woodcutters,
Two stand quietly opposite.
Asking my surname and style,
A smile—unrecognizable.

*Passing Yuantong’s Quiet Chamber*
Tonight the spring wind is exceptionally clear,
Graceful pavilion’s eaves chime in the breeze.
Fallen blossoms cover the ground—who knows?
Calling for red lanterns to light the green lattice.

*Inscribed on Dream-Nine’s Elixir Chamber: Collected Antiquities*
Pavilion gazes at the sea’s sun,
Wall hangs a map of Kunlun.
The great recluse dwells in the marketplace—
A true man amid the dust.

*Suffering in the Bustle*
Suffering in the bustle—misery extreme,
Dust-sea’s sorrowful songs weep in lines.
Worldly affairs like chess, moves not easily made,
Human feelings like gall, most difficult to taste.
Who understands the perils of wind and waves?
Wandering travelers meet, faces aged.
I wish this floating life would pause more often,
In white clouds’ depths, joy without end.

*Joy in Stillness*
Joy in stillness—who can convey its pleasures?
Fish and birds befriend one, dusk nears madness.
Wandering wilds in ease, a true blessed land,
Mountain dwelling’s delight is a pot of heaven.
Drawing clouds to mend peaks, floating green bamboo,
Channeling water to fill ponds, nurturing white lotus.
All share this pure flavor—
Who knows the hermit’s self-content?

*Left for Layman Ye at Tianzhu Monastery*
About to leave, yet lingering for half a moment’s talk,
Spring wind circles the path thrice.
Unknowing of fallen blossoms outside the gate,
Gently stirring the stove’s ash, seated in the small hut.

*Traveling the Mountains*
Fine rain misty, emerald peaks deep,
Countless fine mountains, shadows dense.
Desolate wild temple, few human traces,
Grass covers the immortal altar, the Daoist heart still.

*Self-Portrait for Wangzi*
Feigning madness, playing the fool,
Returning to truth, guarding the Dao, far from dust.
Turning away from perilous wind and waves,
In moonlight’s glow, the face appears.
Atop the mountain, the primordial crane’s cry,
By the stone, seated with white clouds as company.
Who can attain such scenes?
Telling fellow disciples, eyes widen in laughter.

*Song of Gathering Lotuses*
Lotus leaves and flowers fill the pond,
Cool-seekers sit at the water’s center.
Suddenly hearing a boatman beyond the mist,
Swaying hibiscus perfumes the ravine.

*Hearing Dream-Nine’s Son, Simin, Reading Aloud*
Most fitting to hear is the sound of reading,
From the next courtyard, each word clear.
Willows by the window, grass covers the ground,
Spring night’s rain passed, the study serene.

*Song of Riding Clouds for Dream-Nine*
Do not envy the wild goose’s distant flight or crane’s soaring,
Do not boast of the leopard’s misty fur or tiger’s wind-roar.
Hear my song—
Its qi burns even brighter.
From the fertile marsh, my life’s green dragon,
Named the celestial steed, stallion of stallions.
Westward crossing the Gobi’s endless sands,
A single leap ascends to join the blue clouds.
Cloud-journey distant,
Cloud-qi misty,
Cloud-ways vast,
Cloud-shadows shimmering.
Suddenly, several gusts of fierce wind blow into the four hooves,
Straight treading the thirteen myriad leagues to the azure vault.
Ah!
Swift beyond pursuit,
Lofty beyond reach,
Fear only that immortals, O, may long follow after you.

*Riding the Phoenix Chant*
I do not wish to sing *Great Wind* and cherish heroes,
Nor do I wish to ride the long wind and break ten thousand miles.
I have long wished to be like ancient Liezi,
Immortal, immortal—what joy!
Today the Dao is accomplished—such is this:
Floating, floating, cool, cool, vast, vast,
Riding the void, riding the wind, not knowing where it ceases.

**Inscription at Nengren Monastery**
Veil upon veil of rain for days on end,
Misty clouds enfold ten thousand trees.
River’s voice follows the bank as it winds,
Fisherman’s song drifts across the brook.
Heaven and earth vast within a poem,
Pavilions and terraces framed in a painting.
Where the latticed window leans aslant,
An immortal guest leaves the dust behind.

**Evening Clearing**
Light rain retreats, distant peaks turn green,
Evening brings autumn’s breath to the courtyard.
Though tomorrow’s sun may shine bright,
It will still carry coolness into the emerald screen.

**Quiet Chamber**
Far from the red dust, hidden in green vines,
In stillness, the sound of rain is often heard.
At dawn’s first light, the sky clears to azure—
Laughing, I ride the clouds to the Great Canopy.

**Inscribed at Mengjiu Monastery**
Within the small cosmos lies the great cosmos,
Here stands my home, the Non-Dual Gate.
I urge you, seekers of the Way in the world,
Do not wander lost in the dusty sea.

**Early Autumn Night Walk at Qianfeng Temple, Listening to a Lute**
Fresh rain washes away the lingering heat,
Early autumn brings a tender chill.
Wandering by night through the Yellow Leaf Temple,
A voice sings of the White Cloud Land.
The temple bell sinks into the abbot’s hall,
Lamp in the shrine illuminates the Dharma hall.
I love the playing of the *Green Silk* lute,
Its pure tones ringing clear and bright.

**Inscribed on a Stone at Zizhi Cave**
River clouds damp, river sky deep blue,
Beyond the mist, the temple bell just ceases.
Trees dark and dense, mountains hushed and still—
Leaning on my staff, I stand like a crane at rest.
Jade grass seals the cinnabar chamber at the cave’s mouth,
In this quiet, who recognizes the ancient immortal?

**Evening Scene**
Moonless night, deep mountains, wind howls with a tiger’s roar,
A stalwart passes, his sword’s glow crimson.
Immortal herbs gathered, the Daoist returns late,
Hearing a woodcutter’s song drift over the water.

**Changqing Monastery**
Twice I’ve wandered through spring rain and mist,
Each time lingering briefly in this small courtyard.
All things under heaven are but fleeting lodgings—
Flowers, wine, and idle verses bring carefree joy.

**Admonition to Mengjiu**
Wield the sword to cut away afflictions,
Pluck the lute to draw forth stillness.
The heart of the Dao awakens from this—
Flowing water passes the fisherman’s rock.

**Mountain Journey, Playfully Dressed as an Earth Immortal**
Wreathed in mist, I cross the Straw-Cloak Ridge,
Braving rain, I return to the Conical-Hat Mountain.
Do not say dragons and serpents cannot be grasped—
My long song already soars amid the white clouds.

**Night Crossing of Qinghui Pavilion While Traveling in the Mountains**
Clapping hands, I chant and whistle,
Slowly ascending the emerald slopes.
A thousand cliffs washed by fresh rain,
Ten thousand peaks wreathed in damp clouds.
Night pavilion’s lute falls silent,
Autumn steps grow lush with grass.
Cool inspiration stirs within—
Leaning against a tree, I stand by the rocky gate.

**Nine Peaks Mountain**
Crossing the river, I soar to the emerald summit,
Nine peaks shrouded in mist, beauty veiled in haze.
From the Pure Sound Pavilion, I gaze—
A crane from the east, like Su Shi’s immortal spirit.

**Leisurely Gaze**
Mountains borrow clouds and mist to hide their rugged bones,
Waters carry boats to ferry travelers.
A sweeping view of heaven and earth stirs poetic feeling—
All things in creation have their own causes.

**Early Spring**
Spring wind carries my crane-drawn chariot,
Again I arrive at the immortal’s small gathering.
New plums just hold their snow-white buds,
Tender peaches all bloom with water-red branches.
After a year’s brief parting, we meet once more,
Laughing together as we compose poems.
No need to cling to rigid rules—
Heaven and earth’s misty scenes are all worth pondering.

**Evening Stroll at Yueyang Tower**
Crickets chirp softly through the quiet window,
A touch of new coolness already feels like autumn.
Faint rain still patters from the eaves—
Do not lean on the high tower with your flute.

**Returning Home**
Return, ah, return!
The cloud-palace scatters, moonlight unfurls.
Riding a yellow crane nine thousand leagues,
I arrive at the cinnabar terrace by midnight.

**Stone Sail Mountain: Hermitage of the Daoist**
On a clear night, I burn incense in my hut,
Delighted by meditation on my rush mat.
Moonlight spills beyond the autumn window—
Laughing, I roll up the bamboo blind to read Daoist scriptures.

**Another Inscription**
Clouds embrace the cold mountain, the mountain embraces my hut,
The heart of the Dao, serene and still, naturally thus.
Cranes rest, tigers sleep beneath the pine cliffs—
Returning from gathering herbs, I read once more.

**Three Impromptu Poems at Weiyang**

**I**
Autumn mountains faint, waters stretch far,
Leisurely I drift my boat, chanting by the Twenty-Four Bridges.
A thousand rows of green willows, ten thousand crows in flight,
In the red glow of sunset, I listen to the flute’s melody.

**II**
At Guabu, the tide’s roar mingles with rain,
Autumn arrives with the wild geese at Wucheng.
Tonight, the moon is split in two—
Still, I love the Wu people playing their phoenix flutes.

**III**
Life’s journey offers boundless wandering—
Do not let the dust age your black hair.
Holding the golden elixir, worth ten thousand strings of cash,
I boldly ride a crane out of Yangzhou.

**Visiting Master Chen’s Chrysanthemum Pavilion**
The path winds, my staff slants by the eastern fence,
Sunlight fills the ground, illuminating yellow blossoms.
Green wine cups gleam in the sun like white silk,
A black hat in the wind recalls Meng Jia’s grace.
Three paths overgrown, few traces of dust,
Two ridges veiled in mist, wild shade deepens.
The Daoist paces, singing with hands behind his back—
No sign of the peak’s barbarian with his topknot.

**Ode to Red Leaves, Presented to Others**
Grasses and trees, though without feeling, seem full of it—
Crimson maples and dark cypresses, how pitifully they live!
Laughing, I point to the drunken cold mountains from my tower,
Leaning on the railing, I first mistake them for a light snow’s clearing.
True qi already withered, only color remains,
Facing the setting sun, all is silent.
Among the peaks, I love only the plum blossom—
Guarding its whiteness, defying frost, its nature stays pure.

**West Peak Pavilion**
Returning by moonlight, the traveler shuts the gate,
By the river pavilion, flowing water echoes in the empty mountains.
Leaning on the railing, I let out a long whistle—
A crane’s cry rises, a lone wisp of smoke returns to the ridge.

**Chant from the Mountains**
Ancient sun and moon in the mountains,
Great spring and autumn within the gourd.
I wish he would quickly compose a poem of resignation—
If he does not resign, it will all be sorrow.
Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow—
Turning men’s hair white!

**Minister Luzixia’s Journey**
The bridge is narrow—let others pass first,
The sky is vast—I alone soar through it.
Two lines of new verse convey my heart’s intent,
Again I see the moon over the sea, blown clear.

**Playful Verse**
Coming and going, originally without hindrance,
Going and coming, crossing with feeling.
Drunk, I ride the Azure Dragon through the Jade Capital,
Leisurely, I summon the White Crane to the Jasper Court.
Above, I keep company with lofty immortals,
Below, I can follow beggars on their rounds.
Clothed in leaves, a hat of clouds—
Such effortless mastery belongs to the master.

**Inscribed on a Stone After Rain at Mount Lu**
Flying waterfalls hang from the cliff’s stone,
Each fall a thousand fathoms.
Sudden rain washes the mist from the peaks,
Each peak presses close to the next.
The sea wind blows me here,
Mountain clouds follow me upward.

**Adorning the Hair with Jade Grass, Singing Fishermen’s Songs**
Jade grass blooms pinned in my hair,
Fishermen’s songs on my lips.
Clapping hands, I ascend the tower,
From the secluded chamber, the zither’s notes ring clear.
Freely I brush dragons and serpents,
Each character alive with form.
To know who I truly am,
Gaze toward the Brush-Rest Peak.

**Presented Upon Passing the Three Fragrances Pavilion**
Tigers roar, resonant, from the mountain ridge,
Fish chants echo, steady, in the Buddha hall.
Most wondrous beyond the sparse moon—plum blossoms,
Confucian texts read on until the fifth watch’s length.

**To Meng Jiu**
I sing of the rootless, yet rooted still,
Jade flowers and magic grasses seal the gate.
Within the grotto lies a small heaven and earth,
Sleeping warm upon the coiled stone.

**The Temple of Neng Ren**
Wind scatters withered yellow leaves across the mountain,
An old monk sits in quietude, the brushwood gate barred.
A single wintersweet tree, more fragrant than snow,
In broad daylight, with none about, I am even more at ease.

**Roaming South Peak**
Mountains like old friends, ever meeting,
Waters like travelers, turning back again and again.
Layered green-black waves curve into yellow,
Teaching me to linger at every step.

**Inscribed on Master Chen the Daoist’s Portrait**
Raising the blind, we gaze at the fresh dawn,
In the small chamber, tea smoke’s scent is pure.
Aloud he recites a scroll of the *Huangting*,
The Master seated within the plum-blossom canopy.

**Also Inscribed**
The Master’s bearing, lofty and austere,
A square kerchief on his head, legs crossed.
Wishing to view the sunlit mountains’ frost and dew,
He rises, staff in hand, his rush mat slung.

**Plum Islet**
North wind blows snow, ancient clouds grow cold,
On the ridge, plum blossoms bloom at this hour.
From three hundred trees, petals take flight,
All at once swirling back to the forest’s edge.

**Moon of the Horse’s Hoof**
Moon of the horse’s hoof, moon of the horse’s hoof,
Worldly affairs rush by, toiling and fretting.
Unknowing of the red dust’s bitterness,
How could one know the joy of pure emptiness?
Pure emptiness—
Seated on the rush mat,
A stick of incense burned,
A tune plucked on the zither.

**Inscribed on a Stone at Mount Huang**
Wind from beyond the heavens stirs the crane,
In the pond’s waters, a dragon appears.
Now I let forth a long whistle and depart,
For the thirty-six peaks of cloud.

**Spring from the Living Rock**
Chiseled stone yields a clear spring,
The spring’s flow still washes the stone.
Wearing a bamboo hat, I emerge from the mountain,
Laughing into the empty green mist.

**Chanting the Steep**
Heaven’s Pavilion Mountain.

**Heaven’s Pavilion Peak**
Heaven’s Pavilion Peak stands tall,
Riding a crane, I ascend the cliff and depart.
The empty mountains hold no one,
Alone, I meet the clouds.

**Inscribed on a Self-Portrait**
Wind and sun purer than wine,
Water and clouds as light as poetry.
Seated within the cosmos’ gourd,
This old immortal master.

**Four-Character Verse**
The field of nature bears no shadow,
The heart-ground clears itself.
After rain, the mountain’s hues—
Vivid, empty green.

**Revisiting Terrace City**
Again I tread the path to Terrace City,
Rowing once more with two oars.
Crows caw on the sparse willow bank,
Cicadas shrill in the autumn of Six Dynasties.
Winding waters encircle Jingkou,
Strange peaks embrace Stonehead.
In green shoes and plain cap,
I smile at the carefree gulls.

**Playful Chant**
Playfully I roam the red dust beneath emerald peaks,
The immortal’s work is but compassion.
With an even mind, the ten thousand things are naught,
Poems flow from my hand without need of craft.
Dragon’s qi unfurls in wisps of cloud,
Crane’s song soars high, the household at ease.
May all grasp the principle of longevity—
Joyous singing follows the flight through sea and sky.

**Inscribed at Round Clarity’s Spacious Mountain Lodge**
To step back is to leave blessings in reserve,
To withdraw when idle is the mark of the realized.
Gentle rain, faint clouds, wind rippling,
Oriole and blossom—spring in its prime.

**Also**
Flowers at two parts bloom with greater vigor,
The moon at fourteen is already full.
If one grasps the meaning of "timeliness,"
One attains the carefree realm of joy.

**Preface to *Later Cloud and Water Collection***
*Later Cloud and Water Collection* comprises works composed after Master Xi Ling’s encounter with the gentleman. The Master’s spirit roams sea and sky, his delight ever in bright chanting. Whenever he visits the Jiannan Circuit’s yamen, he invariably presents new poems. Gathered and transcribed, they form this volume, which one day shall be published alongside the *Earlier Collection*, to mark the Master’s vast seal and, perhaps, reveal his wondrous essence.

**Colophon by a Disciple of Round Clarity**
*Cloud and Water Collection*

**Ascending Huabiao Mountain**
Huabiao Mountain stands high, its crisp qi soaring—
Lingwei once rode a crane to ascend here.
Sudden rain streaks descend from empty skies,
Yet clouds ahead need not bar my climb.
Alone atop the peaks, the heart grows vast,
Gazing afar at Bohai’s surging tide.
One day I’ll follow Master Ding’s path,
Letting loose a long whistle on Pengqiu’s first tier.

**Composed While Traveling Among the Mountains of Liaoyang**
A thousand li to Liaoyang, come and gone,
Mountains in my eyes like paintings viewed.
Men praise the earth’s qi flowing from Changbai,
I seek cloud-capped peaks to refine the Great Elixir.
Wind sweeps past layered screens of pale mist,
Rain’s aftermath leaves each ridge cold and high.
Here lies a fine path to long life—
Entering the world, speak not of leaving it as hard.

**Composed in Autumn of the Jiazi Year While Traveling in Yanjing**
I do not wish to climb the Terrace of Gold,
I only wish to drink from the chrysanthemum’s cup.
Drunk, muddled, I forget heaven and earth,
Fame and profit through the ages—all mere dust.
Cease galloping, pause and rest,
Resolve worldly ties while still in your prime,
Then return to the Five Peaks and Three Isles.

**Presented to Minister Lian**
The true man does not reveal truth,
The mysterious gate does not display mystery.
What are these alchemists?
They swarm forward, offering themselves in vain!
Yao and Shun enjoyed long lives,
Their non-action and stillness were complete.
When did they ever consume metals and stones,
To thereby attain great age?

I admire Minister Lian,
Whose loyal sincerity is steadfast as a clenched fist.
In memorials he attacks heterodox teachings,
His resolve firm as iron and stone.
My family has two elders,
Who even now dwell as immortals.
Zhang Liang learned grain-avoidance,
Zhiyi hid in a fishing boat.
Pure, they drew near the Son of Heaven,
Yet never spoke of mercury or lead.
Their work accomplished, they boldly retired—
Such is the way of heroes.
Kings and emperors have their own affairs,
How could they linger at the edge of white clouds?

All who would be great ministers
Must first heed Confucius’ warning.
I admire Minister Lian,
Whose upright qi rivals that of the worthy Meng.
The age has given him the name *"Lian the Mencian."*

**Inscribed at the Hall of Perfect Goodness for Its Master**
Not a speck of dust is permitted to intrude,
Willows all around cast their deep shade.
The master himself knows how to halt,
No thing can shake his heart of perfect goodness.

**Composed in Gratitude After Lord Dong of Lianping Recommended My Name to Grand Guardian Liu Zhonghui**
Worthy meets worthy,
Encountering one who commends.
Ashamed I lack the timber of pillars,
Yet my name stirs the emperor’s ministers.
I seek the grottoes of Gou,
No desire to occupy a strategic post.
Declining honor, I go forth to expound the Dao,
Wishing to manifest as an official in the world.

**Seeing Off Minister Lian to Jiangling**
I have an aged parent,
Whose hair has already turned white.
I obtained a humble post—
A virtue of yours.
You cherish talent,
I do not covet salary.
You depart for Jiangling,
Where the people will all receive your blessing.

**For Grand Minister Liu Zhonghui of Boling**
Your name and style, sir, I bear in mind,
A mountain recluse entering officialdom.
One post permits my idleness,
A hundred clans all simple and good.
Prison yards grow autumn grasses,
Men long for their native villages.
Seek another worthy magistrate—
I will not sit in the zither hall.

**Reflections**
Mao Yi withdrew into seclusion,
Ge Hong never clung to office!
I would seek Li Taibai,
To speak together of the Great Return Elixir.
State and family are others’ burdens,
I alone grieve, solitary and bereft.
Tears stream down my face,
Wild geese cast shadows in the cold heights.

**In Reply to Grand Minister Liu’s Letter**
A true minister of a peaceful age,
How few through the ages!
The *Green Satchel* was but a trifle,
Yet you did not shame your sovereign.
Your single word weighs more than gold,
Your letter moves me deeply.
What you say of geomancy, none understand—
Only I, in silence, trust its depth.
Why do you, sir, esteem one so lowly?
This grace, this virtue, lifts me up.
Your letter arrived too late—
My parents’ remains were already interred, and I dared not disturb them.
A thousand dragons stretch from Changbai for ten thousand li,
From my youth I have guarded their secrets.
I seek no fame, no profit,
Only that my parents rest peacefully in that place.
The Grotto City’s Great Mountain and Lesser Peak,
A bridge of immortals at its gate—this delights me.
With this I answer you, sir—pray understand,
Do not say this youth presumes to argue.

One day I will visit you on the road to Xingzhou,
At the foot of Eight-Tiered Mountain, I ask you to reflect.

**Reflections on Reading the Biography of Zhang Liang**
The six states’ many lords, all in disarray,
Swept into Qin’s borders, then gathered by Han.
Had the Lord of Pei been like Xiang Yu,
Zhang Liang would never have served Liu!

**Composed Upon the Unexpected Visit of Daoist Qiu Before His Departure**
I see the master arrive from beyond the world,
The master sees me, his face alight with smiles.
Without office, I naturally seek the Yellow Stone,
With guests, why not share green wine?
The heart for leaving the world descends from sea and sky,
The mood for entering the mountains returns with the clouds of the peaks.
When shall we gird swords and carry long flutes,
To visit the perfected ones at Azure Terrace?

**Lament for Grand Minister Liu Zhonghui, Composed in Early Winter of the Eleventh Year of the Zhiyuan Era**
His learning encompassed all else,
A great minister of ancient times.
Serene, he forgot desires,
Lofty, he cast off the dust of the world.
Who in this age knew him?
In court, he repeatedly recommended others.
One day, passing Eight-Tiered Mountain,
I will pour clear wine to honor his spirit.

**At Thirty-Two, Traveling North Again**
Returning to You and Ji, I forget my emotions,
My black gauze cap exchanged for a Daoist’s garb.
Tomorrow I’ll gird my sword and carry my zither,
Ascending West Mountain to gaze toward Taihang.
*(West Mountain is a separate peak of Taihang.)*

**Song of the Upper Bend**
Sparse willows, pale yellow in the fading dusk,
The leisurely Ku River cleanses the dust’s haze.
Straw sandals carry me to the summit of Yao Peak,
Westward I gaze toward Changshan—only white clouds.

**Mount Heng**
Where the essence of Bi and Mao congeals,
Mount Heng’s qi stands lofty.
Vines and creepers cling to sheer cliffs,
Pines and cypresses roar with flying waves.
The northern wilds stretch empty and vast,
The numinous wind howls in fury.
I build my hut on Immortal’s Ridge,
My gaze afar stirs soaring ambition.
*(The mountain has a Peak of Gazing at Immortals.)*

**A Long, Long Song for the Northern Peak, Composed in the Jiawu Year of the Zhiyuan Era, at the Age of Forty-Eight**
A long, long song,
A long, long song—
Forty-eight years idly worn away,
How long can a man’s life last?
Clinging to Heng Mountain for sixteen years,
Journeys to Yan and Zhao become flowing waves.
Better to take up zither and sword, don hat and rain cape,
And eastward to Penglai sing the Daoist hymn.

**Eastward Journey**
This body drifts forever between water and clouds,
Roaming Qi and Lu at leisure.
I long to seek the guests of Fanghu and Yuanqiao—
Immortals dwell on the Three Mountains for ten thousand ages.

**For Magistrate Jia Ximeng of Tang County, Younger Brother**
I arrive at the Qing River,
Where tang blossoms bloom everywhere.
My elder brother rides forth like a tiger,
My younger brother slaughters a chicken in welcome.
Governance seeks companions in the mountains,
The cosmos is ruled by muddled talent.
Ever mindful of the "Four Knowings," never ashamed,
We sit together upon this terrace.
*(Within the district stands the Terrace of the Four Knowings.)*

**Visiting Mount Tai, Following Younger Brother Ximeng’s Rhyme**
Soaring beyond Heaven’s Gate, past Stone Barrier,
Life reaches this point to broaden its grand vista.
The western cliff stands like an immortal’s mound,
Who in the Eastern Sea casts the net of Renzi?
Seventy-two dynasties’ feng and shan rites are ancient,
Three thousand miles’ bounds are vast.
With you I sit beneath the Qin pines—
A gust of celestial wind strikes cold upon the face.

**Watching the Sunrise at Sun-View Peak**
The celestial rooster crows, the sea gate opens,
The sun surges from the waves, rising from the sea.
A crimson glow stretches unbroken for ten thousand li,
The peaks of the Three Mountains pile green in heaps.
From afar, the sound of sheng pipes and cranes descends from the void,
Only clouds and dragons return with the rain.
Yet other flying immortals brandish deer-tail whisks,
Making one crane one’s neck toward Penglai.

**Seeking the Hermitage of Zhang Zhonggao in the Mountains**
Dwelling in cliffs, drinking from valleys—an old family way,
Today I seek the old man but do not meet him.
A single long whistle from the immortal’s mound,
White clouds fly within Mount Tai.

**Red Rock Mountain**
Atop Red Rock’s summit stands Penglai Pavilion,
One may gaze toward Penglai but cannot approach.
Celestial winds and sea waters stir the heart,
Vast and boundless, they open and close of themselves.
I arrive in Dongmou, my vision unbound,
My poetic spirit bold and free as a hero’s.
At dawn I emerge beyond Fusang,
Where towers and palaces gleam with gold and silver.
Clapping hands, I sing long, and cloud-cranes take flight,
Immortals drift slowly before me.
Raising my cup, I offer libations to the sea, praying to the sea god,
To spread radiance for a thousand myriad li.
My distant longing yearns to see the heavens beyond the sea,
Heaven floats at the sea’s edge, the sea knows no bounds.
I wish to ride a whirlwind chariot and fly there,
Yet unable to grow wings, my heart drifts in vain.

**Mount Culai**
A hundred-zhang peak, a hundred pines,
Each pine’s ancient trunk an aged azure dragon.
Where are the Six Idlers of the mountain now?
How many times have I come seeking this peak?

**East of the Yellow River**
For three years, my footsteps have traversed the land east of the river,
Wearing the moon, donning the stars, my sleeves filled with wind.

Ascending mountains, I laugh and lean on a single bamboo staff,
By rivers, I idly pluck a three-foot paulownia zither.
When shall I meet a Dao companion amidst seas and peaks?
Where in this dusty world may I seek an immortal elder?
Better to find a quiet place,
To nurture my heart in forgetfulness and clarity.

**Evening Travel by Thunder Marsh**
Waters multiply, mountains layer, the path grows faint,
Here must be the land of white clouds.
At dusk, I walk alone by Thunder Marsh,
Gazing at Mount Shouyang beneath the bright moon and clear wind.

**Roaming Mount Zhongtiao**
Nine heavens float in lush verdure, towering and steep,
A green bamboo hat and blue straw cloak mirror the azure sky.
My heart yearns for the celestial realm,
As a feathered immortal lightly arrives at Zhongtiao.
No need to wash my feet in the Yellow River,
My shoulders ever bear the white sun.
Two flying wild ducks, light as cranes,
By the bridge in Wangguan Valley.

**Travels in the Central Plains**
North and south through the Central Plains, I seek the true,
Everywhere singing high to mourn ancient texts.
Rolling dust swallows the mansions of ministers,
Vast and dim, the sun sets over imperial tombs.
My body drifts like a broken stem on flowing water,
Shouldering a jade zither beneath the evening glow.
Tomorrow I depart again for Henei,
Carrying in my sleeve the clouds of Mount Taihang.

**Mount Wangwu**
Within the seas, the greatest cave-heaven,
Mount Wangwu is first among them.
Since ancient times, white clouds have flown,
To this day guarding the primordial chamber.
Grottoes echo with reed pipes,
Peaks cradle the sun and moon.
I wish to build a thatched hut and dwell here,
To refine my spirit into an immortal’s form.

**Mount Song**
The great fire of Li opens the cinnabar wall,
Marking the true summit of the Central Plains.
Spirits and immortals dimly stand on the Three Terraces,
Tai and Shao peaks tower, dividing two chambers.
Now I seek the Dao like a blue lotus,
Climbing the sixty-six wondrous peaks to their summits.
On stone I play the zither, thoughts drifting,
In clouds, cranes soar with scaled wings.
Suddenly thirsty, I recall dark wine,
Scooping mountain springs to rinse my mouth.
At dusk, the bright moon hangs on the pines by the stream,
Pine waves roar like thunder in several gusts.
Within stillness there is movement, yet movement is leisure,
With a coconut ladle and palm-leaf whisk, I sit among the rocks.
Though I meet no true master, it is joy enough,
Leaving my wild-goose prints to mark Mount Song.

**Western Journey**
Within my breast, the Five Peaks all explored,
Tai, Dai, Heng, and Song—three already passed.
Today I ascend Western Hua,
Where white clouds part to gaze at Zhongnan.

**Thoughts in a Guanzhong Traveler’s Temple**
Leaving my homeland, I wander everywhere,
Through frontier clouds and passes, moons of many autumns.
Ding Gong’s ambition was to return as a crane,
When will Zi Jin return to his old mound?
Today by the Wei and Shang, I am like a traveling goose,
Last year north of the river, like a drifting gull.
By the stream, I launch a boat to seek verses,
Ten thousand heads of wind-bent bamboo line both banks.

**Mount Hua**
Towering and sheer, great Hua overlooks all Qin,
Here the hundred-two rivers and mountains hold reverence.
Where the banished immortal scratched his head in the clouds,
Where the goddess bathed her hair after the rain.
Idly I seek pine nuts among green ridges,
Drunk, I rest my head on stone roots beneath the blue sky.
I love the traces of Xi Yi’s high reclusion,
And should bring later seekers into the mysterious gate.

**Impromptu Verse Passing the Clear Wind Grotto on Bright Moon Mountain**
On Bright Moon Mountain’s peak, I admire the bright moon,
At the mouth of Clear Wind Grotto, I sit in the clear wind.
Chanting to the wind, whistling to the moon, I shall grow old,
Facing the moon, listening to the wind’s endless song.

**Evening Travel in Baoji**
Suddenly I wander to Qin and Feng,
Lightly arriving at Baoji.
The road follows distant flowing waters,
Mountains press low the evening clouds.
Three peaks stand face to face,
My heart rests in a single cot.
I build a thatched hut to briefly rest my feet,
I too shall grow old by Pan Stream.

**Inscribed on the Wall of a Humble Hut**
Beneath Mount Chencang, a Daoist’s home,
No mulberry fields, no hemp.
Burying my name, hiding in a secluded place,
I gather firewood and draw water, living out my days.
Several layers of stone ridges stand like tigers,
A single thatched hut small as a snail.
Though my qi is strong and body hale in old age,
Where in heaven and earth may I seek cinnabar?

**Willow by the Ferry**
Ferry willow, ferry willow,
Year after year, thread after thread.
Ever binding partings for the official’s house,
Can you bind the path of wandering immortals?
A long whistle sounds from the Celestial Ford,
Tattered robes flutter, never looking back!

**Master Lü Chunyang of Dongting**
This meeting is not without cause—your verses, Master,
Seeking the Dao and the true for decades.
Graceful bearing, lightly playing the wind flute,
Majestic air, girded with a dragon-spring sword.
Your body comes from seas and peaks to this place,
Your hand brushes lake clouds to gaze at distant skies.
I wish to learn from you, diligently saving the world,
Parting at Dongting to journey to Western Sichuan.

**Leisurely Travel in Yan and Zhao: Qiu Changchun and I Then Roam West Mountain**
The sky is cold, the sun pale over Youzhou,
In Yan’s market, I seek again the old winehouse.
Newly learned madness, a drunken man,
Old friends and heroes now lie in desolate mounds.
Time’s passage is not like the days within a pot,
An ant’s life is but a bubble on water.
I meet a perfected one to discourse on the great Dao,
Roaming West Mountain’s clear snow together.

**Two Poems on Jicui Village in Liaoyang**
Bow in hand, I chase flying birds,
Who knows it is an old man returning?
On the white poplar’s grave, I leave verses,
Half the city’s people are right, half are wrong.

Scenes tangle like hemp,
My worldly affairs barely settled, I left home early.
Do not wait until the nest is imperiled and eggs broken,
Fame and power are but flowers before the eyes.

**Composed Descending from Kuizhou to Jiangling**
Twelve peaks of Wu, each clearly traversed,
From Kuimen I whistle and descend to Jingzhou.
At dawn I chant beneath the setting moon of Emei’s sands,
At dusk I face the slanting sun of Yanwei Isle.
Mountains and waters vast, I miss my Dao companions,
Heaven and earth boundless, few are my immortal peers.
Better to ride a crane from Liaodong,
Returning home to visit my old mound.

**Meditating on the Past at Red Cliff**
Red Cliff has several sites,
The one in Jiayu is where Zhou Lang broke Cao’s forces.
Sheer cliffs press the water’s bend,
Here the three-part enterprise began.
Where are the dragon’s struggle and tiger’s fight now?
Moon pale, wind clear, I come again.
The rolling Yangtze washes day and night,
Vast battle ramparts stir with wind and thunder.
Inspired, I long to summon Su Shi to whistle,
Play the flute, board a boat, and journey together.
Most divine, to be rain and cloud,
Do not compare the dusty dream to a true person.
Immortal rings descend dimly from the sky,
One piece of grace, one piece of spring.

**Inscribed at a Shu Market**
Mornings hidden in Qingcheng, evenings entering E,
Through Shu’s comings and goings, I’ve seen many men.
Eyes watch the white sun hasten away,
Mouth sings the Blue Immortal’s stamping song.
One gourd, a priceless treasure,
Two rivers’ wind and moon, a nest of peace.
Roaming through mountain forests and dusty markets,
Everywhere I leave poems—do you recognize me?

**Chant of the Two Lakes**
Transformed into a fisherman, I punt my skiff,
Roaming freely between Hunan and Hubei.
Wine drained, I could swallow Cloud Dream whole,
Chanting done, I soar high past Ezhou.
Gazing afar at the moon over Wu lands,
A long whistle pierces the autumn of Chu skies.
Laughing, I meet an old man by the Xiang’s banks,
Who points to Jiayu where he casts his hook.

**Jiayu, the County’s Name**

**Writing My Thoughts**
Heart and fate fluttering, pitiable indeed,
Wind-lantern, rain-lightning press upon my years.
If I never ascend the waves’ garden, I’ll become a ghost,
Where among cloud-capped peaks will I meet an immortal?
Nine deaths endured, I still bear the power of the Dao,
Three lives lived, yet I fear falling into worldly ties.
I offer petals of incense to Zhongnan in advance,
Surely a true person sits by the stone’s edge.

**Zhongnan Presents Itself to Fire Dragon Master**
White clouds and blue mist vanish in the distance,
I’ve arrived at the immortals’ Jasper Flask.
Wagering my hempen sandals to seek the earth’s navel,
Only then do I behold the Great Dao in Heaven’s Capital.
Heaven and earth’s single qi hides in the cinnabar chamber,
Sun and moon’s twin orbs illuminate the crimson furnace.
Truly, I met you too late, Master,
Mercifully, hasten to ferry this cold scholar.

**Leaving Zhongnan, Two Poems**
All my life fond of goodness, I sought immortal elders,
A hundred thousand taels of gold scattered like dust.
Deep gratitude to the perfected one for transmitting the wondrous formula,
Exiting the mountains to seek companions and aid primal work.
One straw cloak, one bamboo hat, descending Zhongnan,
Clouds white, mountains clear, the ten thousand forms contained.
When the great elixir is smelted and complete one day,
I’ll return to bow deeply before the immortal’s hut.

**Song of Elixir Completion**
Deep in the grotto, the ancient spring is hidden,
Heart empty, qi still, nurturing the primal spirit.
I seek directly the thousand-year medicine beyond the world,
Unstained by half a speck of human dust.
Now drinking peach wine,
Now plucking lingzhi roots,
Drunk and dazed, qi and blood flourish.
Eight ounces of true lead, half a catty of mercury,
Moon full, flowers appear—scenes beyond description.
Seizing tigers, capturing dragons are mere trifles,
The precelestial qi demands diligence.
Fire phases distinct, degrees precise,
Ten months’ work complete, I shed the sacred and true.
Where do fools seek the elixir’s method?
This is my family’s unparalleled gate.

**Two Impromptu Poems at Taihe Mountain**
Taihe Mountain’s white cloud nest,
Facing the wall, my work deep as Bodhidharma’s.
Today the Dao is achieved, I speak of its wonders,
Yet words fall short—practice is far greater.

Nine years without affairs, without poems,
Silent and dull, I know not myself.
If there’s anyone in the world like me,
I’d gladly transmit the cinnabar formula to them all.

**Inscribed at Wudang Mountain**
Seventy-two peaks in verdant array,
Wudang’s mountain hues resemble Heng’s.
Tomorrow I’ll fly past Hunan,
Eight or nine peaks I’ll traverse alone.

**Hengshan**
Today I’ve fully toured the Five Marchmounts,
Perched atop the peak on a yellow crane.
First I sought the northern guardian,
Only stopping at Shang and Heng did I rest.
Though ten thousand li separate Yan and Chu,
The two mountains are just Kan and Li embraced.
The Dao’s wondrous work follows the same track,
Again I see Xiang’s robes flowing in nine streams.

**Ascending Yueyang Tower, After Du Fu’s Rhyme**
I long to climb Junshan’s summit,
Soaring in song, I reach this tower.
One lake divides north and south,
A thousand li of water and clouds afloat.
Beyond the sands, geese in rows,
At the sky’s edge, a few boats.
Where rivers and streams gather,
Vast and great, they do not rush.

**Inscribed for the Officials of Henan Who Have Heard My Name—Mocking Them**
Discarding fame and wandering at will,
I often view lords and marquises with cold eyes.
Civil officials and generals are but dust,
Green brows and red rouge all skulls.
The crane’s chariot flies high beneath southern peaks’ moon,
Crows caw in chaos over Beimang’s autumn.
Lush grasses all wither,
Better to ask the cloudy mountains for the way ahead.

**Evening Stroll in Xianyang**
Wild geese at the sky’s edge arrayed beyond the clouds,
I too chant long on Xianyang’s road.
Xianyang’s ancient road, grass tangled,
A hundred generations of kings and lords all withered husks.
Westward ten thousand li, many are my reflections,
How can mortal life compare to the immortals’ bliss?
Let the seas turn to mulberry fields,
The crane’s form and pine’s bearing never age.

**Passing Wugong by Moonlight, Flying to the Gorge’s Plank Path**
Patched robe and palm-bark bowl unkempt,
Last night I flew past the Wei’s western bank.
White clouds startled the Liangshan geese,
Cool moon hastened the Lu Inn’s roosters.
Often I’ve traveled the Qin-Shu roads,
Carving cliffs, I’ve seen all the inscriptions.
My body moves through perilous planks as level ground,
Only then do I know the phoenix chariot surpasses horse hooves.

**Jinjiang River**
The river flows from Min Mountain to Shu’s capital,
Following the current east, it exits Kui and Wu.
I wish to emulate Master Yuan Zhen,
Renaming myself a misty-wave fisherman.

**Chant on the River**
I’ve learned the fisherman’s *ena* song,
Singing high, I steer my magnolia boat.
Cloud sails in disarray, lost in the Three Chu,
Misty waters vast, passing the Nine Rivers.
Gathering heaven and earth into my small skiff,
I let years and months rush past like rapids.
This body, unrestrained, is originally unmoored,
A lone goose skims the waves, a single shadow.

**Roaming Mount Lu**
From afar, the screen peaks unfold ninefold,
Arriving, I first know this is an immortal land.
I call back the mountain tiger to chant beneath the moon,
Summon the cloud dragon to embrace the stone beam.
When the high bank roars, flying waterfalls,
Where faint mist floats, incense fills the censer.
The Daoist’s mood deepens with secluded delight,
Receiving Mount Lu’s days and months as long.

**Chant of Wu and Yue**
North and south of the great river, I drift at will,
Roaming through Suzhou and Hangzhou, my Dao deepens.
Riding a crane, I whistle atop Wu Mountain,
Flying a simurgh, I shun seekers at Yu’s cave.
Vast Dongting hides fishing boats,
Faint Tiao Creek washes travelers’ lapels.
Wu and Yue’s waters graceful, peaks strange,
I float alone, my back to the sunset zither.

**For Zuo Si Yuanwailang Jia Guangbi Yu of Luling, Who Met Me in Hangzhou and Claimed a Love of Lakes and Mountains—I Write This to Encourage Him**
You and I meet, our surnames the same,
Do not relegate lofty aspirations to emptiness.

Here now the translation:

---

Now the scene shifts between ease and gloom,
Yet since ancient times, the wise and bold have kept their course to the end.
For a thousand years, West Lake has sheltered recluses,
While south of Six Bridges, old heroes grow gray.
Riding donkeys or drifting in boats, they leave behind fine tales—
Let me tell you, sir, of this spirit.

**Song of Leisure at Tianmu**
Ling’an’s refined essence gathers at Tianmu,
Each dawn I release white clouds to drift.
A stone pool pours high from twin peaks,
Its ripples round and bright as sun and moon.
The Daoist’s thirty-six grotto-heavens,
Inscribed in jade and jasper, passed down through ages.
I build a hut and dwell briefly atop the mountain,
Where blue simurghs and white deer keep me company.
When leisure comes, I go to Hangzhou,
Laughing freely amidst lakes and hills, tasting true delight.
Transformed into a wandering monk, I lean on my staff—
On Three-Lives Rock, who might I meet?
Plum Blossom Isle, Willow Embankment,
Jade flutes and painted barges drift east and west.
The Daoist whistles long and returns to the mountain,
Gazing back, the world below is lost in mist.

**For Abbot Guanghai**
Deep in the pagoda, you sever worldly ties,
Your *śamatha-vipaśyanā* practice perfectly aligned.
Heavenly flowers faintly reveal subtle blessings,
Wind-borne leaves chant the *Mahāyāna* sutras.
By day, your chamber is still, clouds its canopy,
By night, the courtyard empty, the moon its lamp.
In samādhi, the ten thousand forms dissolve into nothing—
Who, arriving here, can still see the old monk?

**Meeting My Uncle, the Two Historians of Hangzhou**
Seeing through floating life, you flee the city’s bustle,
Your song’s rhythm steady as you climb Mao Mountain.
Old brother, I gift you nothing else—
Only the immortals’ one flavor: leisure.

**In Jinling, for Shen Wansan**
The Qin Huai flows past great fishing families,
Seeing through floating clouds like evening mist.
By moonlight, we boat and buy green wine,
As you ask me of cinnabar elixirs.
Who grasps the wondrous principle of the Yellow Center?
Here in White Down, heroes boast of this alone!
I wish you’d use your wealth to fathom the Dao’s law,
So your whole household may live without sighs.

**Parting from Wansan**
Heroes clamor, all bent on conquest,
You and I speak only of the Way.
Today the *qi* of kings flourishes in the southeast—
One day, I’ll meet you again in the southwest.

**Two Poems on West Lake**
On the lake stands a red pavilion, in the pavilion a man,
Before the pavilion, water mirrors the man before my eyes.
Who is that in green straw cape and bamboo hat?
I am the true one in the painting of mist and waves.

People sing, people laugh, filling crimson boats,
Willow-lined long pavilions and short pavilions.
Yet I love the fisherman’s serene elegance most,
Who gently poles his skiff to Xiling.

**For the Daoist of Jinsu**
Jade Mountain’s finest spot, a lovely garden,
How many wanderers step into its painted screen?
Suddenly, all is swept away—
A heart made clear, thoughts stilled, waters cool and pure.

**Chant of Returning to Shu**
The six directions are my home,
The two luminaries my lamps.
Though I am a man of Liaodong,
Roaming Shu feels like returning home.
Faint, faint the clouds of Wu Mountain,
Curved, curved the moon of Mount Emei.
Bright, bright the waves of the Jin River,
Cheerful, cheerful the land of Ba.
Everywhere I spread the subtle Dao’s wind,
My mad delight perfectly content.
Where does the simurgh’s chariot stop?
Again, I lodge at Qingcheng.

**Returning to Qin**
From Shu to Qin, I do not shun Qin,
Long dwelling in Western Qin, I seem a man of Qin.
On Baoji’s stone, I inscribe my verses—
Who recognizes this carefree being beyond the world!

**In the Late Autumn of the Bing-Ox Year of Zhizheng 26 (1366), at Jintai Abbey, My Wandering Soul Returned After Seven Days—I Write This Gatha for Yang Guishan to Hint at the End of Yuan and the Beginning of Ming (For the 28th Year Would Be the First of Hongwu)**
The primal *qi* vast, returns to Great Purity,
Again it follows the Vermilion Bird down to the jasper capital.
Seven days of stripping away, the soul revives—
All under heaven gaze upon the bright sun and moon.

**Entering Shu**
Sword Gate’s grandeur, Shu’s mountains high,
Flying back and forth, even the crane grows weary.
Countless emerald peaks scattered in tiers,
A thousand layers of jade ridges encircle all.
From time to time, a shepherd’s flute blows autumn grass,
Everywhere, woodcutters’ winds roar in evening waves.
I love most the moon atop Emei’s peak,
Its pure radiance shining white on the Daoist’s robe.

**Fisherman’s Song**
Xiang rain, Dongting clouds fill my fishing cape—
Escaping fame, hiding my name, what joy!
New sun and moon point to brightness,
Old mountains and rivers point to origin,
Rise and fall, success and ruin—let them be.
Sleeping by Dongting till the long sky dawns,
Who knows the lofty man Zhang Zhihe?

**For Master Jiao Shimou**
Ziling bowed high before Emperor Guangwu,
A lone guest star shining through the ages.
Now I see Master Jiao before me—
Who matches his noble integrity and pure conduct?
In youth, he befriended the future Ming emperor,
His reputation resounding like wind through Xu’s nest.
When his old friend rose to become Son of Heaven,
Several times imperial summons came to the mountain hollow.
With a pig’s trotter and a jug of wine,
He went directly to see the emperor to repay his friend.
Loudly he called for the *Guanglu* to prepare mountain delicacies,
Facing each other, they drank, laughed, and clapped hands.
Before the feast, three belts of horn and silver-gilt—
The emperor ordered him to take them, to test his heart.
Forcibly he took the horn belt in play,
His hidden feelings silently dwelling in the cloudy groves.
From then on, the court called him *Qianhu*,
But the master smiled coldly—what was that worth?
Lightly he cast it all aside and entered the famous mountains,
Like Zhang Liang forever parting from Han Gaozu.
Beginning and end reflect each other,
Wondrously fitting nature’s course.

Having long studied mountains and waters, I have particularly set my mind on the great Mount Emei of Shu and the Wudang of Chu. For each, I built a hut as a retreat for my wandering spirit—stepping out, I enter the realm of the green phoenix’s ten thousand li; stepping in, I nestle in a single wisp of white cloud. On a fine evening of clarity at Wudang’s *Qiyun Hut*, gazing toward the *Liuyue Hut* on great Emei, I composed this:

To Chu and Shu I come and go,
Building huts to recline in two famed mountains.
In stillness, a stir—yet stillness remains;
In leisure, true ease is found.
Awaiting only the purple missive from the palace gates,
I study the cinnabar formulas to ferry others across.
On Wudang, night faces the moon of Emei—
From afar, I recall my disciples have already closed their passes.

*Idle Gaze from Qiyun Hut*
Verdant woods fill the emerald slopes,
The Daoist stands at leisure by the rocky door.
Fierce birds and raptors harbor no suspicion—
Beyond the gate, they tread through mist and fallen leaves to return.
Wind rolls mountain clouds flying over waters,
Rain scatters willow floss, spring’s remnants fade.
The pure hut knows no affairs all day,
Two scrolls of the *Huangting* nurture the true nature.

*Idle Chant*
A few cries of apes and cranes echo the pine pass,
Sitting in cold solitude, the drifting cloud’s intent grows idle.
Though traces exist, they are as if beyond the world;
With no mind, why depart from the human realm?
Beneath the forest shade, the chessboard’s residual kalpas lie empty,
In the furnace’s depths, the elixir’s union appears.
Peach blossoms on flowing waters—gone beyond recall,
One turn of the head, ten thousand mountains intervene.

*Again*
Heaven and earth stretch vast—a single cloud,
Why trouble to bind oneself to fame and renown?
Blurred crimson and green—three trees of blossoms,
A herd of deer roams high and low across the fields.
Naturally, the clear void connects with the celestial river,
No need to sigh over withering by the Fen.
In vain, one carves the spirit’s terrace—
Chaos has ever known no divisions.

*Departing for Ba-Shu: Presented to My Disciple Qiu Yuanjing*
Through bitter resolve and austerities, you guard *Qiyun Hut*,
The great Dao I shall one day entrust to you.
Do not lightly abandon my hut to venture forth,
Lest others compose a *"Northern Mountain"* ode for you.

*Inscribed at Xuantian Abbey, Presented to the King of Shu*
Casually I hooked the sea’s great turtle,
Returning with a laugh, I followed the Jin and Tao.
Blossoming peach trees unfurl in spring’s perfection,
Emerald bamboos thrust forth, their joints tall.
My heart dwells in the phoenix’s palace, the dragon’s scales’ assembly,
My body rests in Tortoise City, weary from horse’s hooves.
Why speak of Zhongnan’s swift path to office?
For me, worldly ambition is lighter than a goose feather.

*Left in Chengdu at the Jiang Family Residence*
Coming and going, I traverse with feeling,
Playfully wandering Jinjiang City with a gourd.
My body harbors the great Dao, yet none recognize it—
They only love the plum branches sprouting from the earth.

*Refusing the Summons, Composed in the Eighteenth Year of Hongwu*
Flowing waters and drifting clouds cannot be reined,
Why must the court persist in its summons?
From now on, I shall conceal my name and surname,
Roaming freely north and south of the mountains.

*Reading the Collected Works of the Late Yuan Dynasty’s Yang Lianfu, Formerly Regional Supervisor*
Iron Cliff blows the iron flute,
Its pure tones fill the cliffs.
In this declining age, his fame looms large,
Yet in the deep mountains, the qi’s aspect is empty.
His writings transcend the cosmos,
His integrity, that of an aged hero.
Only the moon of Huating
Remains as lofty as this gentleman.

*Formerly Composed "Eight Escapes" and Wrote Eight Eulogies to Express Admiration—Here Recorded Are the Eulogies*

*Yan Ziling’s Radiance*
Resplendent Yan Guang,
Humble Emperor Guangwu.

The Emperor said, "Ziling, why not assist me?"
Yan replied, "Your Majesty, do not press me so!
Returning to fish at Fuchun,
One rod for a thousand ages."

*Virtue Soars High as Fa Zhen*
Lofty and proud, Fa Zhen,
How many such men in a thousand years?
Only his voice is heard,
Never his form seen.
Neither angling for fame
Nor sinking into reclusion.
Confucius spoke of "seeking one’s will,"
Mencius of "heaven’s people."

*Tao Yuanming’s Seclusion*
Upright Tao Qian,
A worthy of the Jin court.
Five willows make a home,
Five pecks of grain cannot bind him.
Returning with the moon,
Arriving with gathered blossoms.
Amidst Chaisang,
Like the age of Getian.

*Dai Andao’s Loftiness*
Noble Dai Kui,
Holding high virtue as his destiny.
Embracing righteousness in dwelling,
Refusing office and fleeing.
Xie Yuan once offered—
Both name and self stood firm.
Joyful and carefree,
Strumming the zither to suit his nature.

*Lu Hong’s Soaring Spirit*
Transcendent Lu Hong,
Atop Mount Song’s peak.
A carefree recluse,
A blissful immortal.
Declining the offered post,
Leaving the bestowed robes unworn.
Where is his thatched hut?
White clouds fill the sky.

**Xuan Yuan’s Collection**
Lofty Xuan Yuan,
Far withdrawn to Luofu.
Eating of trees, clad in grasses,
Clouds his quilt, stone his pillow.
The emperor sought the Dao—
The master hid the Dao.
Not like gold or stone,
But like selling rouge and powder.

**Chen Xiyi’s Reclusion**
Vast and boundless Xiyi,
Holding fast to rectitude, harboring marvels.
No boast of cinnabar arts,
No display of primal mysteries.
Unfathomable to others,
Seeking only self-knowledge.
Reclining high on Mount Hua,
Master of my master.

**Lin Hejing’s Seclusion**
Distinguished Lin Bu,
Alone with solitary Gushan.
Apart from dust, free of filth,
Qi keen, spirit at ease.
Seeking plum blossoms he departed,
Summoning cranes he returned.
Never entering the city,
Forever chanting among the peaks.

**Eulogy for Jiao Xiaoran (Appended Here)**
Radiant Jiao Xian,
A worthy of the Han court.
Some call him recluse,
Some call him immortal.
A thatched hut his refuge,
Wind and thunder his bed.
Thrice summoned, he rose not—
Ah, Xiaoran!

**To Friends Before Journeying to Yunnan (With Preface)**
From the second year of Hongwu (1369) to the twenty-fourth (1391), I dwelt on Mount Wudang for twenty-three years. There I composed alchemical classics, let loose pure whistles, concealed my traces, and veiled my light—clouds came, cranes went. Recently, I heard that Shen Sanshan offended the court and was exiled to Yunnan, his son-in-law, my friend, implicated. The southwest beckons—shall I go? Thus I write this first to console those banished to the southern seas.

Within the gourd, sun and moon; within the cave, spring—
Twenty-three years, a body in stillness.
From afar I know the exiled of Yunnan,
Foolish rains and barbarian winds—missing old friends.

**Meeting Shen Sanshan in Yunnan and Gifting His Son-in-Law, Yu Shishe**
A household of immortals on a small outing,
Father and son-in-law dwelling by the Yunnan sea.
Jade Stream Gentleman, Yu Shishe,
Ice-pure Elder, Shen Sanshan.
All for ivory’s curse,
Never touching dragon scales, yet daring to offend.
Today I come to deliver you all—
Great elixir surpasses the great sword’s ring.

**To the Two Immortal Maidens, Shen Xianyang and Yu Feixia**
Xianyang the immortal maiden,
Senior disciple of Xue Zhenyang, eldest daughter of Shen Sanshan.
Young, she left the world; her father exiled to Yunnan,
She suddenly came to visit, and with my daughter took the great medicine,
Ascending in a rush.

My daughter—beloved of Shishe,
Lady of Xiping Marquis Mu Chun,
Received her grandfather’s transmission of the outer elixir.
Feixia was the name I bestowed,
Once recorded in a short biography.

Shishe was not without sons,
Sanshan also had boys.
The immortal maiden and my daughter—
Two magic mushrooms of Penglai.
Taking my celestial medicine,
They soared to Kunming Lake.
The old man opened his laughing eyes—
My Dao belongs to these charming fools.

**Yelang**
Morning parted from Kunming, descending to Yelang,
Where towering mountains hold immortal realms.
The Year of the Rooster, together we worshipped the Azure God,
Bird-paths high, I flew as the Yellow Crane.
Winding trails coiled far up Guansuo Ridge,
Peaks embraced the hills of Marquis Wu.
Ever are dense woods rich in secluded places—
Laughing at southerners dwelling here!

**From Qujing to Qianyang**
Above the true peak, purple simurghs soar,
Escorting me to view the mountains of Guiyang.
Along the way, flying chants linger unscattered—
The master has already passed the ancient town.

**Ritual Chant at Fuchuan Mountain, Pingyue**
This mountain’s clouds and waters all serene,
Nightly I burn incense in earnest devotion.
First wearing lotus flowers, I face the Northern Dipper—
The Star Lords grant me longevity.

**Crossing the Qian River at Wuya Pass**
A thousand miles of Yangtze, misty azure haze,
Crimson clouds flying to Wuya.
Cliffs cold, trees fallen—the immortal realm apart,
Waters graceful, mountains wondrous—scenery splendid.
At the wanderer’s tower, pouring bamboo wine,
On the cowherd’s ox, plum blossoms fall.
Inspired, I gaze upon heaven and earth’s vastness,
Laughing and carefree through endless years.

**Ba Yue Mountain, Gift to Monk Dingyi**
Ba River rises Ba Yue,
Layer upon layer of green.
Not Lu Mountain,
Yet within it stands Incense Burner Peak.
By chance I pause here,
Delighted to meet the high monk.
I have a bamboo staff—
Transformed, it becomes a green dragon.
I gift it to the Chan monk—
One day, perhaps, you’ll follow!

**North Ford Tower, Five Li North of Shunqing Prefecture (Poem Stele Still Stands)**
Who called me to wander within Shu?
North Ford Tower surpasses Yueyang Tower.
Misty sandbanks, fishermen’s songs rise,
Waters mirror the river city, years gathered.
Endless clear waves surge day and night,
A thousand layers of whitecaps float past and present.
With boundless passion, I ascend and gaze—
Only now do I know this is the first prefecture south of the pass.

**Lingyun Peak**
Among Shu’s mountains, Lingyun holds the spirit’s grace,
Waters and woods pure, far from worldly dust.
In nine-peaked mists, simurghs and phoenixes cry—
Immortal sounds unheard by mortal ears.

**Crane Cry Mountain**
Buying wine in Linqiong, entering emerald haze,
The cliff-dweller shoulders white clouds home.
Carefree in the twenty-four immortal caves,
The stone crane joyfully cries and takes flight.

**To Wanpuzi, Visiting Wudang**
Such as you are a heroic immortal,
Riding tigers and dragons—what a stalwart!
Roaming the world, propping up sun and moon,
At your sword’s tip, playing with clouds and thunder.
On the battlefield, thrice seizing Gao Xu’s might,
In conversation, twice shaming Guangxiao’s talent.
Today I urge you to return to your grotto—
The infant still needs to be reborn.

**Song for Master Wang (A Minister of Jianwen Emperor)**
Master Wang,
Loyalty and righteousness complete,
Styled himself "Great Fool,"
Also called "Nature’s Truth,"
Concealing his name, hiding his nature like a madman.
Sometimes dwelling in the valleys of Yuhua,
Sometimes by the marshes of Jinhua Mountain.
Among mountain villages, he came and went,
Scholars and poets shared wine and verse.
Drunk, his spirit turned to his former lord,
Tears welling, weeping to heaven.
His usual clothes differed from others—
Wearing hemp, donning a bamboo hat, his heart’s affairs conveyed.
At times, he spoke to rustics:
"After death, hang me from a treetop.
Is it not that the earth has no clean soil?
With all my heart, I wish to be a crane-nesting immortal?"

**Reply to the Yongle Emperor**
Your Majesty,
Boundless fortune and virtue.
I am but a rustic,
Of no use in these times.
Yet bearing your imperial brush,
Repeatedly descending to Taihe,
Carriages and horses sent many times,
Startling the gibbons and cranes.

May it please Your Majesty,
to purify the heart in governance,
to restrain desire and exalt virtue—
the people’s fortune is the sovereign’s fortune,
the people’s longevity is the sovereign’s longevity.
Alchemists’ gold and minerals are best not trusted.
I humbly present a poem, begging Your Majesty’s perusal.
Additionally, three oral songs are appended,
all expounding the recluse’s path of desire-renunciation and self-cultivation.
Should they not be dismissed as heterodox arts,
your servant would be most fortunate.

When earth and heaven harmonize and transformative works succeed,
court and countryside alike enjoy peace and the Way prospers.
Within the Hall of Imperial Supremacy, dragon and tiger lie still;
beyond the clouds of Wudang, drums and bells ring clear.
Though dwelling in the wilds, I am of no use,
Your Majesty’s inquiry into the humble grass-cutter shows compassion.
How dare I weary the sagely ear with my humble words?
Yet purifying the heart and curbing desire is the path to longevity.

The audience for the Southern Culmen’s Longevity Assembly,
held on the first day of the noon month in the fourteenth year of Yongle.

At dawn, the enlightened sovereign once more pays homage to the origin,
within the Southern Culmen Palace, sumptuous feasts are arrayed.
The red sun before the steps heralds myriad years of longevity;
auspicious clouds fill the hall where immortals gather.
The Dao aligns with hexagram qi, the body abides in *Dui*;
names follow the sequence of lines, yielding precedence to *Qian*.
Holding the cinnabar script, he returns to the blessed land—
the heart’s work of delivering others knows no bounds.

**Inscribed on the Wall of Chongqing Temple in Nanjing**
For ages, the cinnabar classics have been enshrined in sacred scriptures,
two words—*stillness* and *tranquility*—can prolong life.
Why seek formulas everywhere,
only to let heretical texts disrupt canonical models?

**Again**
The sojourner of mist and clouds holds the secret of longevity,
roaming emaciated through mountains and marshes, embracing ageless spring.
Who will discourse on this principle with the imperial house?
Failing to cultivate the Way of governance, they turn to cultivating the Real!

**Again**
Heaven’s net has already ensnared Shao Yuanjie,
Hell has just claimed Tao Zhongwen.
If they possessed elixirs of immortality, they should not have died—
now that they are dead, what more can be said?

**Again**
The Jade Emperor’s clerks recognize no Son of Heaven,
the golden towers and terraces belong to the hidden and vanished.
I wish the sovereign would sit in dignified repose,
purifying thought and restraining desire—this is the mysterious tone.

**Reading *The Collection of Puan***
Puan’s Daoist countenance was full of purity and abundance,
his words on the vicissitudes of time ever evoked sighs.
Rather than serve another, he gladly shaved his head,
yet kept his beard to restore his former self.
Who would appreciate the verses composed at the tolling of the bell?
His staff soaring through the void, he found joy in solitude.
A single point of cinnabar heart concealed the candle of wisdom,
its bright light gleaming to illuminate the darkest paths.

**Recluse’s Chant: Composed in the Southern Crags of Wudang**
Who can seek the hermit Sanfeng?
The nine-chambered cloud crags lie deeper still.
Vast pine smoke forms a painting without ink;
rushing stream waters submerge a zither without strings.
A black gibbon accompanies me, dissolving worldly cares;
a white crane attends me, steadying the heart of the Dao.
I laugh at those yellow-crowned ones chasing wealth and honor—
not one among them is a true friend.

The *Palace Poems of the Western Park* self-annotates: During the Zhengde and Jiajing reigns, [the author] once received an imperial patent of nobility. At that time, the palace daily amused itself with spirit-writing games, so these poems were composed to preserve a tone of admonition—lest it be said that immortals know nothing of state propriety.

In the Western Park, none stir as the white day lengthens;
The Supreme Lord reveres Lü Chunyang in solemn devotion.
The immortals have long understood their proper station—
They would never accept a stick of incense from the hands of Yan Song of Fenyi.

Again:
In gold-speckled script, memorials ascend to the Jasper Pool,
Silently awaiting the green phoenix’s descending brush.
The Sacred Chariot alone harbors the intent of King Mu of Zhou—
Palace ladies clamor to see the goddess wield her brush.

Again:
Mad Zhang is summoned, then Mad Zhou,
Their wild cursive transcribing the *Zhidào* chapters of Kongtong.
The Son of Heaven on the altar of offerings □□□,
“I now enfeoff you as a celestial immortal.”

Again:
Five-colored clouds escort the Sacred One’s arrival,
Only then is the Tower Reaching Heaven revealed as another realm.
Here, no suburban or ancestral rites are performed—
A single stick of incense is lit, a bow toward Penglai.

**Preface to *Three Cloud-Water Collections***
The *Three Cloud-Water Collections* are works composed by Master Sanfeng during his second journey to Jiannan. In the Yongzheng era, the Master came here to rouse Governor Meng Jiu from his slumber, often sojourning among the lofty peaks that pierce the clouds. After the governor departed, the Master vanished into reclusion. Recently, Elder Yuanyang, Layman Zhuo’an, and the recluses of Dun Garden and Panshan—all with hearts set on mountain forests, natures enamored of springs and stones—have seen the birth of hermits, and the Master has returned once more.

Between Qingcheng and Great Emei, one might encounter an old woodcutter wandering carefree among water and stone, or an old fisherman chanting verses amid streams and mountains. In black robes or yellow crowns, myriad transformations unfold—only with time does one realize the Master is among them, a fortune for our kind.

The Master’s dharma-form is rarely revealed, and even when shown, none recognize it. His refined words and wondrous phrases are shared only through brush and paper. He never speaks of fortune or misfortune, nor of alchemy or cinnabar. What he often discusses are loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, kindness, humility, harmony, and purity. Occasionally, he composes poems and songs, their echoes arresting clouds and waters. As his impromptu verses accumulate, ink marks grow abundant. Thus, they are printed and preserved, that others may know the joy of immortals is no more than this—what difference does it make?

**Three Cloud-Water Collections**
**Song of Revisiting Jiannan, with Preface**
Since Governor Wang departed Jiannan, I have not returned to Jiazhou for another hundred years. Recently, the Lesser Weaving Star shines brightly over Lingyun’s Nine Ravens. Between the Qingyi and Changyi rivers, I compose this poem of revisiting Jiannan, to record my search.

Transforming into simurghs, cranes, clouds, and mist,
Again into fishermen, woodcutters, and old immortals.
In concealment or revelation, roaming where fate allows,
The Lesser Weaving Star illumines Nine Peaks’ summits.
Now tracing cliffs and valleys to chant verses,
Now gazing at water and stone, playing with streams,
Now riding a yellow calf to the mountain’s front,
Now cradling a green zither by the pine’s side.
Neither knowing nor regretting, dwelling in groves and gardens,
Neither envying nor seeking, tending the field of nature.
These are all recluses and sages—
I wish to visit them, to keep their company.

Wondrous is the ancient grotto-heaven of Qingyi,
Emei’s qi linked in a single hook.
Dragging an iron staff to seek secluded depths,
There, a few speak of spontaneity.

How joyous!
A hundred years since last in Jiannan,
Returning, still the same as Zhang Xuanxuan.

**White Cloud Hermitage**
At noon, beneath the forest’s shade, rain’s coolness lingers,
A thousand tall bamboos shelter the sutra hall.
The old monk chants, clouds just clearing,
The room is small, the day long, the self at ease.

**Humming by Dongting**
Beyond the flowers, wind stirs osmanthus to fall,
Autumn’s air is pure, the sky vast,
Wild geese soar high over Dongting’s bends.
Dongting’s bends—
A flute plays long,
The joy of roaming immortals.

**Fisherman’s Song**
A single boat, spacious for sitting or lying,
Where waves are perilous, all is serene.
Clouds drift lightly,
Waters stretch boundlessly—
Dongting’s mist and rain, a poem to behold.
At dawn, sitting alone beneath Jun Mountain,
Only reed flowers brush the fishing rod.

**Rain on the Seventh Night**
Having heard the flute of Prince Jin at Mount Gou,
Again comes autumn rain’s jade-like chime.
A great wind blows down the Milky Way’s waters,
Not a sound of sorrow or lament.

**Travels in Shu**
Returning from Penglai to wander Shu’s lands,
Ever detained by white clouds.
In misty straw cloak and rain hat, a leisurely guise,
Transformed into a farmer, free and joyous.

**Winter Excursion to Emei**
Hand in hand, we roam Emei’s peaks,
Winter’s chill stirs the treetops.
Wind comes from the northern ridges,
Yellow leaves fill cliffs and valleys.
Deep in the forest, along broken steps,
Lies snow of a thousand autumns.
With Dun Garden
Day after day,
Secretly, quietly.
Poems are chanted slowly,
Wine is sipped endlessly.
In drunkenness, wild laughter—none recognize me.
Green shade covers the ground, the sun at the railing,
With you, I sit upon the rock of Pantu.

**Farmer’s Invitation**
Fields and gardens face the window, all views fair,
Guests arrive to speak of farming’s joys.
The farmer’s delight—
Truly unerring,
Spring wind and spring rain reach the thatched hut.

**Inscription on Hanxu’s Alchemical Poems**
A body of immortal bones, a brush in hand,
Inspired, he sings a hundred poems.
From now on, the price of golden elixir rises—
Ten thousand taels of gold cannot buy it.

**The Vast Flow of Bishui**
The vast flow of Bishui reveals the Dao’s mechanism,
Deep in the pond’s pavilion, fish take flight.
A single white cloud drifts into the void,
Beyond the sky, rosy light reflects emerald radiance.

**To Panshan**
Worry not, grieve not,
Let not worldly cares disturb your heart.
The mountain’s bright moon, the river’s waters—
Cleansing the breast, all things cease.

**Double Clarity Pavilion, Harmonizing with Immortal Ran’s Original Rhyme**
Beyond the pavilion, two or three visitors,
Within the pot, sunlight spans millennia.
Young lords, each ascend the path of blue clouds,
Our kind should dwell in the Jade Tower.
Laughing, we cast aside metal and wood,
Who counts the years from the beginning?
Year after year, joy at Penglai’s gatherings,
No songs of worldly vexation are sung.

**Immortal Ran’s Original Rhyme for Double Clarity Pavilion**
Five thousand volumes fill the belly’s texts,
In a blink, eight hundred autumns at Penglai.
Starlight, cold, drips into water,
Vast clouds swallow distant towers.
Countless poems written in sand,
Beyond the pavilion, ten thousand bamboos planted.
When wind arrives, the sound of flutes arises,
The Daoist claps hands, singing a pure song.

**Winter Solstice**
Yesterday, yang lay hidden beneath yin,
Today, yin appears beneath yang.
Yin and yang, clear yet divided,
Seeing off guests to the mountain hall.
The mountain hall’s wooden beams creak,
Soughing frost of the tenth month.
With much frost, yin’s breath congeals,
Geese fly south, faintly.
From Dongting, a long whistle,
A flute passes through the Three Xiangs.

**Pavilion of Radiance on New Year’s Eve**
A grand gathering on New Year’s Eve,
Pavilions and terraces renew with the year.
Rivers and mountains stand like paintings,
Lanterns and fires all belong to spring.
Scattering rain over a thousand mountains,
Dispelling dust for ten thousand miles.
In the misty moonlit trees,
Here, I see my true self.

**Clear Ripple Temple**
Qingyi’s waters encircle Clear Ripple Temple,
A sight of clear ripples—painters scarce.
Evening mist on the river, sails distant,
Spring rain among trees, chime sounds faint.
In what year was the Longevity Society founded?
Here, the treasure staff often flies.
The old man in straw cloak and hat—none recognize him,
By the sun’s edge, idly singing, cranes return.

**Moon Over the West River**
Beyond clouds, the cosmos forgotten,
Within the pot, spring and autumn uncounted.
Returning in the third month, free and joyous,
The rivers and mountains before my eyes remain unchanged.
Flowers and trees planted in season,
Pavilions and terraces visited at leisure.
Since ancient times, famous mountains have housed our kind—
Facing scenes, we chant poems and pour wine.

**Affairs at the Daoist Abbey**
Spring’s gloom dimly guards the primal gate,
Beyond the balustrade, flower branches tenderly wrinkled.

All day we sit facing each other behind lowered blinds,
Silent, colorless, speaking of karmic causes in the capital.

**The Radiant Terrace Study**
Tonight, all disciples gather in one hall,
The Daoist writes "Radiant Terrace" himself.
Not only do the disciples discuss wonders—
Even I boast of the brush’s divine inspiration.
Sea winds and sky breezes follow my elbow,
As I wield the brush, unaware of dragons and serpents dancing.
Shaking the Five Peaks, soaring over the blue isles,
The assembly joyfully claps and laughs.
Laughing, clapping hands—the calligraphy endures, the terrace never decays.

**The Immortals’ Joy in the Empty-Void Rhythm**
In the Azure Grotto, the Daoist’s home,
Tranquil, pure, far from the world’s clamor.
Waterfalls cascade like cinnabar cliff rain,
White lotuses idly planted in mountain ponds.
Wine in hand, the clear day passes among the woods,
On stone, the zither embraces the fading glow.
This is the perfect place for cultivating the true—
Why seek elixirs from sea or sacred peaks?

**Appendix: Original Poem**
On Penglai Isle, the ancient immortals’ abode,
Cultivating longevity, far from the world’s clamor.
Iron trees ever perch with thousand-year cranes,
Jade peaks smile as four-season flowers are plucked.
The sleeping dragon awakens to wander green cliffs,
The fierce tiger is ridden to reach crimson clouds.
A wisp of white cloud seals the cave,
A furnace of pure fire nurtures cinnabar.

**Old Immortal’s Portrait**
Eight hundred, three thousand—long since victorious,
Now the good fruit grows even more abundant.
Marvelous traces appear again and again,
With bamboo staff and palm-bark sandals, wandering everywhere.
Thousand-year elders all become old friends,
The ten-thousand-year calendar records long life.
In recent years, mingling in the mortal world,
I’ve learned to change my name like Fu Qiu.

**Appendix: Lüzu’s Response**
Long following the sun and moon, discerning emptiness and gain,
Yet to ascend the Jade Capital on cloud and mist.
The Five Elders should add a sixth to their seat,
The Eight Lords often see off the Ninth on his journey.
Among mountains, I often meet Red Pine,
In the world, I’m mistaken for White Stone Sage.
Past and present affairs all seen through—
The Ten Isles and Three Mountains are fully known.

**Appendix: Hanxu’s Response**
Last night, the flute-playing girl surnamed Ying
Yielded to the young man ascending the Celestial Capital.
Who in the world’s dust would know of my presence?
Alone, I soar through moonlit skies.
Early on, I learned to scatter like the world’s carefree,
Once studying under the ancient master of Gandhara.
Each meal of lingzhi and fuling suffices,
Roaming seas and peaks, I’ve earned a name for longevity.

**Appendix: Zangya’s Response**
Once following Laozi to flee Qin’s Ying,
A hundred generations’ years cannot compare.
Ancient temples, long beards flowing,
Through Three Mountains and Five Peaks, singing as I go.
I once refined the great elixir, inexhaustibly,
Again witnessing Fusang wither and revive.
A smile at Penglai’s shallow waters—
I’ve forgotten my surname and given name.

**Appendix: Panshan’s Response**
After consuming the divine elixir, qi flourishes,
Clouds and waters roam freely through the four capitals.
Flowing with heaven and earth, truly carefree,
Roaring across seas and mountains, wandering alone.
The old crane nurtures a doubly pregnant embryo,
Having eaten the peach of immortality, its fruit reblooms.
My simurgh-drawn carriage briefly visits Pengzu’s tomb—
I laugh at his breath exercises, vainly seeking fame.

**Old Recluse’s Portrait**
First entering Peach Blossom Spring to escape chaos,
Not following false recluses to pay court in the divine capital.
Moving my home to emerald peaks, my heart grows stiller,
Speaking of red dust, my feet grow weary of walking.
Embracing the urn, the old man calls me a dear friend,
Like Jieyu the madman, I bow to the master.
Children and grandchildren each tame simurghs and cranes,
Forgetting the world’s profit and fame.

**Appendix: Lüzu’s Response**
Transformed into simurghs and cranes, qi flourishing,
In recent years, nearing a hundred capitals in lifespan.
In grottoes, mist and clouds roar defiantly,
Among mountains, sun and moon flow naturally.
Planting melons unlike Donglingzi,
Escaping the world before Beiguo Sheng.
Peach blossoms by the stream separate from the mortal realm—
I’ve never heard of current affairs or names.

**Appendix: Hanxu’s Response**
Who knew Xiang Yu’s defeat would bring seclusion?
Together forgetting Liu Pi and the Han’s Western Capital.
Ten acres of lingzhi fields call forth dragon breeds,
A staff of goosefoot follows the deer’s path.
In ancient grottoes, the heart is empty, ever content,
After many years, fallen teeth regrow.
Wandering between green streams and white stones,
Always concealing or evading names.

**Appendix: Zangya’s Response**
Hand-planted green pines have grown tall,
Carefree, untroubled, avoiding the capital’s bustle.
With open heart, like the Ji and Ying rivers, embracing heaven and earth,
Accompanying Chaoyou, settling where I go.
Autumn gardens, spring fields, roaming ancient times,
Fishing mountains, woodcutting waters, passing a lifetime.
Uninvolved in the slightest worldly dust,
I simply take namelessness as my name.

**Appendix: Panshan’s Response**
Not learning the official recluse’s ways like Hou Ying,
Riding an ox, singing loudly, surpassing the capital’s splendor.
Among troops of apes and birds, I’ve transformed,
In depths of cloud and mist, I fly alone.
Plum blossoms for wife, cranes for children—my immortal kin,
Green temples, gray beard—my hair ever grows.
No wonder the old man’s lofty aspirations—
The pure wind long disdains glory and fame.

**South Peak**
Wandering mountains as I please, I love the mountains,
Within and beyond the mountains, returning with the clouds.
In green straw cloak and bamboo hat, walking the peak’s summit,
On the fifth night, the crescent moon just curved.

**Chaoyang Palace**
Cricket chirps clamor in the Buddha hall,
Most desolate places feel not desolate.
Idly chanting beyond the twelve balustrades,
Moonlight hazily reaches the upper realm.

**Night Gathering at the Mountain Study**
Cool winds gently blow beyond the woods,
A slender moon hangs on bamboo tips.
Tonight in the flower hall, sharing wine,
Discussing the Dao, clapping hands—all immortals.

**Wu Peak’s Summit**
The great river encircles the walled city,
Clearing skies, bright tiles open the tiled roofs.
Beyond, merchant sails drift with the clouds,
Within, the monastery nestles among bamboo.
Strange peaks rise straight, waves mighty,
Fresh air soars, mist and haze recede.
This place truly becomes a realm beyond the world—
Carrying wine, treading leaves, ascending the high terrace.

**Visiting Qingyi Mountain**
Newly clear, the mountain’s hues are fine,
Taking this chance to visit Qingyi.
The traveler adjusts cloud-piercing clogs,
Village taverns flutter wine-selling flags.
Carrying wine, treading the high summit,
Sweeping stone, discussing the Dao’s mysteries.
What place compares to this?
Nanjing’s Swallow Rock.

**Visiting Dizhu Mountain**
The path winds through groves of strange bamboo,
People walk atop the high peak’s summit.
Briefly sweeping moss flowers to sit and talk,
In osmanthus groves, the noon bell rings clear.
Beyond the pines, a hundred birds’ songs are heard,
Exploring the secluded, hand in hand, ascending the high ridge.

Here follows the translation:

---

Casually borrowing a line from the Cassia Palace,
A mountain breeze carries my quiet recitation.
On the Flower Festival, a hundred flowers fragrant,
Visiting the sublime, I carry wine to the heights above.

I love the wondrous seclusion of Wu You,
Where mist and rosy clouds embrace the ancient Wenchang.
Entering the emerald haze, then emerging from it,
In Wu You Mountain, white clouds drift.
Pine groves and bamboo isles entwine,
A long whistle—returning beyond the heavens.

**At Bamboo-Embraced Study, Listening to Disciple Yang Panshan Read *Cloud and Water Anthology***
Young Yang, tall and lean of form,
Loved my poems of cloud and water from years past.
In bamboo courtyard on a clear wind, moonlit night,
I hear him scratch his head, chanting slowly.

**At Listening-to-Tides Pavilion, Seeing Li Xilai Off to Langzhong**
Come back, then go again,
Go, but return soon.
Wine shared with one departing,
The pavilion opened for farewell.
Tide sounds drive distant shores,
Moonlight chills the empty cup.
Urging the guest, we set another feast,
Lingering by the pond together.

**Inscription for Bamboo-Embraced Study**
A winding path leads to seclusion far from worldly clamor,
The empty study leans half-hidden in a deep village.
Tower bells drift from beyond the clouds,
Balustrades encircle stone roots.
A thousand tall bamboos house avian friends,
A small pond nurtures fish progeny.
Most delightful after rain, gazing through the window—
Countless green mountains reach the temple gate.

**Ode to Flowers and Wine**
Flowers blooming bring joy, their fall sorrow,
Do not let cups of wine before them go unfilled.
Drinking wine while wearing flowers—spirit soars,
With flowers and wine, depart and return again.

**Inscription for Moon-Reflecting and Sun-Containing Pools**
Red railings mirror the Poet Immortal’s abode,
Deep blue waters cradle the Buddha’s dwelling.
Best to view beneath crape myrtle blossoms—
Branch by branch, tree shadows stand among the pond’s fish.

**Heavenly Gate Invitation (Two Poems)**
Stepping steadily through Heaven’s Gate, eyes smiling wide,
Palaces of gold, terraces of jade.
Mortals, do not gaze for the immortal chariot’s call—
Only those who mount the cloud ladder may ascend.

Where does the cloud ladder lead?
The cloud ladder lies within yourself.
If you know the wonders of refining qi and returning the elixir,
You may rise from the earth to the azure sky.

**At Poet Immortal’s Temple, Honoring Li Bai and Su Dongpo**
I often burn incense and bow to the poems of these two masters,
Their literary brilliance and grace guide later generations.
If their spirits across the ages could meet,
Together we would ride the moon to Mount Emei.

**On the Lantern Festival, Visiting Yang Zi’s Newly Built Panshan Thatched Cottage**
I am the Old Man of Three Peaks,
My gate framed by a mountain shaped like the character "one."
Tonight I come to your dwelling,
The scenery deeply resonant.
Spring’s breath arrives at the new house,
Woods and ponds enter the small bay.
The Yang family’s pure and noble estate,
Truly transcends the dusty world.

**Xuanran Terrace**
On Xuanran Terrace, the guest
Sits in stillness, far from worldly dust.
Tree shadows float on cinnabar cliffs,
Bell sounds strike the white clouds.
Three peaks of Emei stand in the void,
Nine summits divide in the distance.
Best is the Yangtze at nightfall,
Autumn tides heard in quiet.

**River Pavilion**
With spirit roaming seas and mountains,
A long whistle crosses river peaks.
Autumn’s breath fills the pavilion,
High windows sealed by clouds.
The world cannot be without bamboo—
Here, a realm apart unfolds.
Within the hut, sun and moon are stored,
Beyond the cliffs, forests and springs embrace.
Poetry and wine delight through the ages,
Heaven and earth entrusted to the seven-stringed zither.
Most cherished in fine scenery—
Lamp and moon illuminate the gate.

Wine abounds, poetry grows wilder,
Mountains still, the room grows clearer.
What night is this tonight?
Brush and Dao converse in feeling.
A thousand ancient characters on the desk,
A single lamp beyond the eaves.
Gaze afar at the village,
The host’s refined taste arises.

**Inscription for *The Eastern Transmission of the Dao and Its Virtue, with Orthodox Commentary***
Huiweng’s preface sets the definitive critique,
His introduction opens the Eight Virtues’ gate.
Again we see purple qi come from Guanzhong,
Truly behold the Mystic Descendant beneath Li’s tree.
Desiring to guide later generations to shared transcendence,
He makes the primordial Dao ever more revered.
How many commentators praise this edition—
A treasure case long guarded to stabilize Kunlun.

**Self-Immolation Verse Beneath a Painting**
Heavenly immortals do not cling to old forms,
How can a single brushstroke reveal the Dao?
In the radiance of fierce fire, I depart today,
Yang spirit scattered, filling empty space.

**Xuanran Terrace**
At dawn, roosters crow in deep white clouds,
The fifth watch heard in the bronze clepsydra.
Wild geese early pierce distant autumn frontiers,
Seven stars brightly reflect the pure altar.
Heaven and earth laugh boundlessly,
From isles, flying chants bear color and sound.
Best is the mountain tower’s jade flute,
Early autumn’s slanting moon crossing the river city.

**Matching Changyi’s Rhyme**
Dwelling in mountains, cease talk of soft red affairs,
Beyond the gate, the Brocade-Washing River flows long.
---

**Planting Life-Extending Herbs**
Everywhere roots are planted for life-extending herbs,
At every moment, a stake is driven to steady the heart.
I arrive at the ornate pavilion where wind stirs the seat,
As others chant the *Huangting* sutra, sunlight fills the window.
Most beloved is late autumn’s tender affection,
Where feathered immortals join in singing the feathered immortals’ tune.

**Most Desolate**
Alas! Worldly mortals never resolve their dust-bound passions,
Never dreaming of the carefree freedom beyond the world.
At home, they’ve lost their priceless treasure—
With what will they buy passage to the Three Isles?
Vainly aging, vainly aging!

**Matching Master Lü Chunyang’s Original Rhyme**
Harmonious sounds often played on the flute,
Refining qi never apart from the zither.
A message to the Perfect Yang Master:
You must know the great Dao’s sentiment.
Heaven opens with a solitary moon shining,
Clouds rise as ten thousand mountains sink.
On a distant isle, a leisurely recluse—
Why trouble to seek the great forest?

**Linked Verses with Immortals at Shuangqing Pavilion (Limited to Fifteen Rhymes in *Xian*)**
A modest feast set on Penglai Mountain,
Cool night enters the jade-green cliff.
Heaven and earth are the wanderer’s path,
Sky and land the scattered one’s domain.
A great cry from the crane in the clouds,
A distant call to the sail upon the sea.
Sala trees on the Three Isles,
Immortal geese seal autumn’s letters.
Straw hat bearing Yingzhou’s rain,
Mist-clad fire-washed robes.
Wind and flute play in rustling harmony,
Dragon chariots emerge from jagged peaks.
Folding notes to invite the bright moon,
Inscribing poems on vermilion scrolls.
Jade nectar arrayed in painted pavilions,
Treasure staffs leaning against star-lit pines.
This place is originally free of dust,
All transcendents wholly apart from the mortal realm.
Rainbow robes sing in the upper realms,
Magic herbs gathered on sacred cliffs.
Laughing words of the vicissitudes of time,
Spread out like stone tripods’ chime.
Raising my head to the empty azure,
Joining the rhyme in response to *Shao* and *Xian*.

**Cloud Pavilion: Winter Journey from Penglai to Shu**
With a soaring cry, I depart east of the sea gate,
Leaving Penglai once more to arrive here.
My belly brims with primordial essence, luminous and steadfast,
From the outset, wondrous hands move through emptiness.
Ten thousand lines of grass-script characters fall from twin brushes,
A thousand peaks of mist and glow blaze red along the way.
Behold the layered beauty of Shu’s mountains—
Most pitiful are the maple leaves fading from frost.

**Hearing Master Hanxu Play the Zither as Autumn Rain Clears and Geese Cross the Frontier**
After rain, the mountains are still, listening to the zither’s silk,
Silver lamps of sacred incense illuminate the pavilion.
Longing to merge with the Great Void,
Straightaway reducing all existence to emptiness.
The river’s distant sound answers the moon trembling on water,
Mist’s first settling as wind enters the pines.
Most beloved is the pure heart transmitted through fingertips—
No need to raise one’s gaze to send off the flying geese.

**Sharing a Verse with a Lay Practitioner**
Wind carries the rapids’ roar to the pavilion,
Clouds bring rain’s breath into the mountains.
On the western cliff, the sound of axes felling wood,
By the northern stream, the striking of poles to cast fishing lines.
I mingle my traces with fishermen and woodcutters—
Who knows the mountain and water conceal an immortal elder?
Laughing, I share this verse with the lay practitioner,
Beyond the world, a path may yet be found.

**Linked Verses**
Together in this fine wind and sunlight, Han Qingfu,
All transcendents join in song, Bai Ziqing.
A long chant through the empty world, Qiu Changchun,
A single laugh crosses the river tower, Sanfeng.
Qi merges with heaven and earth, Qingfu,
Heart one with the moon on water, Ziqing.
How many affairs through the ages, Changchun—
Forgotten in the grotto-heaven’s autumn, Sanfeng.

**Pure Chant**
Pure tea, pure fragrance, pure Dao-heart,
Pure fast, pure night, plucking the pure zither.
If one can avoid the turbid to speak of purity and stillness,
They leap into the cloudy mountains, nowhere to be found.

**Early Spring Outing with Li Changyi to Pan Mountain for a Small Feast**
The east wind is like a great elixir,
Reviving withered roots at its arrival.
Pathside grasses sprout thickly together,
Everywhere in gardens and groves.
Rapeseed flowers yellow as millet,
Village waters clearer than wiped glass.
Together we love the southern stream’s banks—
Green mountains’ qi and appearance are splendid.

**For Li Yuanyang**
Since relinquishing the seal and returning home,
If you again covet the mortal realm’s descent,
Simply nurture your nature’s celestial dawn and dusk,
Never let spirits and gods know your heart’s ground.
Heaven and earth vast, the zither’s three refrains,
Qi’s breath harmonized, a single flute’s branch.
To cultivate transcendence within yin and yang,
You must cultivate beyond yin and yang.

**Double Ninth Day: Outing to Mount Emei with Master Hui, Lan Yangsu, and Bai Yuchan**
After rain, we soar to great Emei,
Gazing down at the dusty world’s miasmic mists.
All transcendents gather in refined assembly,
Ten thousand miles of empty clarity, each singing freely.
Cranes cry into clouds, harmonizing with Lan’s clappers,
Phoenixes call through the heavens, Bai’s chariot passing.
Only old Lü remains without verse or melody—
Laughing, he cleaves the cliff with his sword.

**The Day After Double Ninth**
Misty villages, river trees, a vast scene,
Painting’s intent, poetry’s sentiment, stirring long interest.
A message to the mountain altar’s disciples:
No harm in enjoying the rain to make up for Double Ninth.

**Two Poems Inviting Disciples to Tour Qingcheng’s Grotto-Heaven**
Seeking the immortal’s abode to trace immortal footsteps,
We ascend Min Mountain’s first peak.
Tenth month’s minor yang, spring’s qi so fine,
In the grotto-heaven’s depths, we speak at leisure.

The immortal’s abode remains, unfolding jade-green windows,
Qingcheng’s subtle discourse—scenery unmatched.
A single clear chime from the cloud gate at dawn,
The mountain moon lingers by the pavilion, not yet crossing the river.

**Laojun Mountain in Xinjin**
Hand beckoning immortals to ascend the clouds,
Zhangzi comes to play the jade flute.
Who can recognize the Supreme Clarity’s wondrous realm?
Only within the heart’s vast emptiness.
*Ha-ha!* Hand in hand, carefree;
*He-he!* Striding the heavenly bridge together.
Two gourds brimming with fine wine,
All drunk, we visit Master Song and Qiao.

**Palace of Longevity**
Where emerald trees pierce the sky,
Clouds journey to this palace.

Beyond the yellow leaves on the winding path,
Mountains lie within the crimson walls of Chicheng.
A secluded courtyard hosts the returning elder,
Whose lingering radiance recalls Master Fan.
Come dawn, we’ll scale the loftiest peak,
Where vast qi rides the boundless sky.

**Pavilion Where Cranes Nest for Drinking**
The immortals’ modest feast atop the highest summit,
Precisely at the heart of Qingcheng’s emerald point.
Countless white clouds encircle the few seats,
Towering screens of sky-piercing peaks array east and west.

**Wooden Bridge at the Heavenly Master’s Grotto**
A wooden bridge spans the azure-clouded stream,
Where flowing waters murmur beneath low-hung green shadows.
Best where the two cliffs converge,
To hear the transcendent birds call across the forest.

**Linked Verses on Qingcheng Mountain**
Wu and the Daoist delight in long recitations of Lü Dongbin,
Soaring beyond the heavens, their steps tread jade-green peaks.
The mountain rejoices as the dragon reveals its grand visage—Liu Haichan,
Immortals pause their cranes to speak of shared hearts—Bai Ziqing.

Three terraces rise faintly through the mist—Zhongshan,
Nine chambers ascend layer upon layer into the deepening haze—Feng.
Still I recall the year I left the world’s net—Haichan,
Lightly treading the cloud-path, chanting beneath the pine’s shade—Ziqing.

**White Cloud and Green Cloud Streams**
Clouds drift on gentle winds,
Mountains hush as waters ripple.
Endless cool clarity,
All arises between spring and stone.

The Daoist blows his iron flute,
The old monk shuts his wicker gate.
Freely wandering east and west ravines,
Perfected beings come and go together.

**Crane-Crying Mountain**
When the Daoist arrives, the stone crane cries,
His spirit soars to the Heavenly Valley, where long life is inscribed.
Now the two streams murmur ceaselessly,
Aiding my dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar.

**Heavenly Valley Grotto**
The Heavenly Valley is where long life abides,
Its stone apertures resound with endless song.
To lodge the spirit, this is the place,
Where one sits and refines the great elixir to completion.

**To the Master of Changyi Mountain Dwelling**
Autumn rains for nights on end dispel the summer’s heat,
The fine eve of the Ghost Festival defies the painter’s art.
Stream winds and ridge moons—friends of immortals,
Beneath bean trellises and melon arbors lies the recluse’s hut.

Our company follows the old master’s teachings,
The mountain dweller can annotate Confucian classics.
Burning incense, we read the *Yi* and discourse on profound principles,
For Dao and Confucianism share a single source at heaven and earth’s dawn.

**Late Autumn at Yueyun Tower**
On the autumn river’s tower, gazing at autumn lamps,
Each autumn lamp glows bright upon the waters.
I have chanted my way here from the two lakes,
The vast sky’s expanse still echoes with lingering sound.

**Playfully Summoning Yuanyang from the Ethereal Mountain**
The Daoist hides himself in the misty peaks,
Where grotto winds whisper and waters ripple.
The white dragon slumbers in the cold jade pool,
The yellow crane returns at dusk to the pine’s tranquil summit.

Fingering auspicious blossoms by the stone table,
Shouldering an iron staff, he strides the heavenly pass.
You two, come early to visit,
Amid thirty-six peaks and twenty-four bends.

**Visiting Chaoyang Temple**
I come from the sea and mountains,
Bearing sea-clouds with me.
Fluttering my sleeves, I release the clouds to fly,
As they depart, they seal the mountain temple.

**Roaming Mount Luofu**
Playfully riding Luofu’s great butterfly,
My spirit wanders vividly through silent peaks.
Suddenly revealing my true form,
Once more a straw cloak and bamboo hat.

On Jade Toad Peak I linger,
Gazing afar as Haiqiong flies toward me.
The two of us clap hands and let out long cries,
How towering and rugged the green cliffs!

Green-haired immortal, yellow rustic,
Many transcendent beings hide and appear in these mountains.
Why not be the host here?
Sweep the stones, set out cups, and drink several rounds.

Sea winds gust from beyond the heavens,
Blowing forth Luofu’s wondrous realm.
How joyous! Truly joyous!
Hand in hand with Ziqing, we return to Penglai.

**After the Rain, Gazing at Mount Emei’s Slopes—Composed in the Immortal’s Style**
Emei’s emerald brush sweeps the rain-cleared sky,
My distant chanting spirit infuses each word with transcendence.
Gathering the mist’s glow into my brush,
Unleashing my bold qi before the tower.

Who can grasp the painting within the poem?
In stillness, free from sorrow, is the truest grace.
Enamored of these misty peaks spreading across half the sky,
My secluded inspiration fills the mountains and rivers.

**Ascending Wawu Mountain**
A great ridge looms high and distant, pressing upon Emei and Min,
At its summit, clouds part to reveal a fresh vista.
Ten thousand trees roar with tiger-like winds,
All peaks, after rain, emerge as dragon spirits.

Pizhi Cliff holds snow of a thousand autumns,
Maitreya’s Grotto knows not a speck of dust.
The earth’s rivers and mountains lie beneath my feet,
This western realm surpasses all others.

**Appended: Linked Verses on Pan Mountain**
Wawu Mountain’s height levels a single beam,
Where immortals fly into the city of transformed beings.
A fine radiance shines forth, cloud-light whitened,
A crisp qi gathers, stone-breath purified.

Ten thousand ravines’ pines and firs exhale distant echoes,
A thousand cliffs’ rain and dew fill the new clarity.
Ribbon after ribbon of silk cascades from the sky,
Pouring the Silver River with a resounding rush.

**Rising Yangtze**
Northwest rains, southeast clears,
The clear river suddenly swells with surging waves.
Children along the banks clap their hands in unison,
Mountains charge, waters stand—thunder roars.

With a sudden crash, rapids part the rocks,
Like horses, like oxen, their hooves race free.
An immortal descends from the void,
Only to see the river’s heart churn with flying snow-like waves.

Transformed into a drifting raft, it sways and drifts,
Following wind and wave to Penglai’s isles.

**Early Autumn Mountain Dwelling**
Plantains, rain-washed, gleam with natural verdure,
Lotus blossoms, wind-tossed, offer effortless cool.
Just right for discussing Chan by the waterside pavilion,
Where osmanthus fragrance lingers within.

**Viewing Fupeng Mountain in the Rain**
Middle Emei refuses to reveal her long brows,
Just as slanting winds and fine rains begin.
Fishermen before my eyes merge into a painting,
Ink-dark clouds overhead urgently summon verse.

The mountain, like an upturned canopy, is no small sight,
Peaks, in retreat, appear all the more wondrous.
Laughing at my straw cloak and bamboo hat,
I stand opposite you, both of us lost in mist.

**Birthday of Lord Zhang Huan of Han**
In Tang, he left his surname in Suiyang; in Song, his name as Martial Ancestor,
His ever-circling heroic qi props up the ages.
Slaying bandits with thunderous might, his troops were invincible,
His strategies pure as ice and snow, his wisdom unclouded.

At Dangyang, his battle cry struck Cao pale,
His inscribed war drum echoed the Han’s valor.
A general of both martial and civil prowess,
Drunk in Chengdu, he worshipped beneath his banner.

**Six-Character Lines on the Scene**
Sparse rain drips from parasol leaves,
Autumn winds turn willows pale yellow.
Chanting as I walk by smartweed blooms by the pool,
I see a painted scroll of watery homeland.

**Long Rain**
Wind and rain darken the new autumn,
An immortal clad in imperial qi treads the waters.
Temple bells beyond the clouds grow damp,
Sails on the river and sky fade into the mist.

Early on the jade altar, the moon departs from the Pleiades,
A jade flute’s long chant fills the wind-swept tower.

Seeking to summon the white dragon back to its cave,
Heaven’s heart and human affairs both stretch into the distant.

**The Night After Lantern Festival, Gathering with Disciples at Listening-to-the-Wind Pavilion**
Wind through bamboo, a rustling tune fills the tower,
Master and disciples converse deep into the night among the groves.
The Lantern Festival has passed—why dwell on it?
Do not let time slip away like flowing water.

**Two Quatrains for a Recluse**
Long have I known Tuanyang as a star of seclusion,
Beneath Mount Emei, nurturing the true spirit.
Leisurely inviting rustic scholars to speak of elixir arts,
Through the night’s cold mist, the door remains unlatched.

White clouds drift over deep paddy fields,
The song of rice-planters fades into emerald peaks.
Last night, the cuckoo’s cry never ceased;
This morning, a fine rain taps at the thatched eaves.

**Inscribed at Wang Sheng’s Residence, Ziping’s Abode**
Half a room’s mountain hues reflect the eaves,
Green bamboo casts deep shade upon the green gauze.
Here the old man’s joy runs deep—
A Peach Blossom Spring where ancients once dwelled.

**Two Quatrains on an Outing to Dragon Gorge with Disciples**
Within Dragon Gorge’s mouth, green mountains rise,
Bay after bay, one curve after another.
Come the clear, bright winds of Pure Brightness,
I’ll don cloud-clogs again to seek the heights.

Just as the mountain bell tolls the evening sky,
Disciples, please ascend the rush-woven mats.
I shall transform into a cloud immortal,
Roaming the pavilion, whistling through the dusk mist.

**Returning to Xuanran Terrace**
Tonight, my spirit descends from the Great Purity,
Heavenly winds carry the sound of jade flutes.
The cloud thoroughfares unfold, the Three Heavens still,
Snow and moon intertwine, illuminating ten thousand miles.

Await my descent, riding a crane with my whole being,
I leave you this word to await the cock’s crow.
On Green Robe Isle, beside the Clear Ripple Temple,
Pavilions rise in tiers, like a jade-green city.

**Late Spring**
Today, the weather is fine,
Spring winds stir the green willows.
Water follows the traveler’s path,
Flowers waft their fragrance across the stream.

Butterflies flutter among the grasses,
Mayflies dance over the wall.
I observe all these creations,
And turn my head, sighing at the vicissitudes.

**Lyrics of the Clear Stream Commandery**
Spring has departed for so long—
When the cuckoo cries at dawn, one must rise at the fifth watch.
Even birds are diligent;
Who among those on meditation mats can dispel this?
To make the spirit lively, the heart must first die—
The man of dead heart is the very seed of immortals.

**Scene Before Us, Shown to Disciples**
True friends have always been few,
Yet after rain, the mountains are abundant.
Clouds emerge, speck by speck, from the horizon,
Majestic peaks traverse the ridges.

Forests and springs, wind and sun at rest,
Wild temples, water and mist in harmony.
All things in the pond are alike—
Red lotuses mirror the green waves.

**Dispelling Summer Heat**
To dispel summer heat, ascend the ancient Buddha’s tower,
Where all mountains and rivers gather before your seat.
River winds fill your sleeves, cloud waves roar,
A single laugh, a long chant—vast qi flows.

**Two Poems on Xuanran Terrace at Summer’s End**
Roaring rapids reach the temple gate,
Ascending the tower, leaning on the pavilion, the four mountains darken.
Only a single red lamp remains,
Laughing with immortals, we raise our wine cups.

Wind and rain patter into the painted pavilion,
The mountain temple’s coolness nears autumn.
Across the river, wild trees entwine with cloud and mist,
As if gathered by Ni Zan’s brush.

**Early Autumn**
The Dipper’s handle spans the Milky Way,
Early autumn gradually points west.
Phoenix-tree winds suddenly rise,
Blowing the moon past the bridge’s embankment.

**Autumn Night Rain, Shown to Tuanyang and Ziping**
Speaking of discussing the Dao, years are not counted,
Carefree beyond the world, like the immortals of old.
Sweep away every speck of dust, root by root, until pure—
Only then may one attain our family’s highest Chan.

Autumn’s hues arrive from ten thousand miles west,
Phoenix-tree rain falls upon the green moss.
Smiling, I take up a few lines to inscribe on the mountain stone,
Reciting them with a graceful air, facing the wine cup.

**Autumn Night in a High Tower**
In the quiet of night, atop the high tower,
The autumn river reveals distant lamps.
Fisherfolk laugh and converse,
Sitting side by side, mending silk nets.

**Autumn Rain**
Rain from the leaking sky scatters,
On level ground, water and clouds arise.
Vast and dim, the three autumns darken,
A lone traveler in a straw cape wanders.

Who has seen the flying immortal’s shadow?
The incoming geese have not yet been heard.
I would ride a swan and depart,
Where misty isles meet the sea’s clarity.

**Hearing Geese on an Autumn Night**
Rain patters until the third watch,
The wild temple’s bell rings, exceptionally clear.
Just as the geese’s formation crosses the autumn frontier,
Wind and snow stretch across ten thousand miles of passes.

Where is the land of rice and millet?
I laugh as the wild geese fly south.
The vast azure vault of the night sky—
Immortals ride you to the Xiao and Xiang.

**Autumn Clear Skies, Shown to Tuanyang and Ziping**
August Heaven bestows good rain,
Ponds and embankments swell with autumn water.
Birds rejoice in the leftover red grain,
The immortal’s chariot soars on white clouds.

Each thing and self at ease,
Heaven and Earth follow their own return.
Roaming in spirit, I play with creation,
Qi gathers, knocking at the Chan gate.

Refined inspiration links the cinnabar peaks,
Lofty chants stir the emerald ridges.
New poems composed wherever I tread,
I scrape the wall to write on the mossy cloak.

**Ascending Xuanran Terrace on the Ninth Day**
Last year on this day, we gathered at the mountain pavilion,
Heaven specially granted clear skies for the Double Ninth.
This year, as before, follows this pattern—
The Daoist rings the noon bell, its clarity unbroken.

**Cold Dew**
On this day, Cold Dew arrives,
Deep in the night, white dew turns cold.
Cool autumn comes beyond the frontier,
Yellow leaves fall at the forest’s edge.

Distant peaks yield lamplight,
High clouds swirl with the geese’s calls.
Laughing, I blow my long flute and depart,
Leaning on the railing of the tower.

**Autumn Night at the Tower of Ten Thousand Views**
At will, I ascend to this place,
Heavenly winds, vast and surging, shake the tower.
Wielding my brush, I sweep away mist and rosy clouds,
Across the river, a fisherman’s lamp emerges from the water’s bend.

**Autumn Day at Dongpo Tower**
Seven-star flowers bloom before the tower,
Withering at dusk, opening at dawn—most pitiable.
Yet they possess a frost-defying heart,
Thus enhancing autumn’s beauty even more.

**Plum in a Vase**
In the cold, jade buds just contain their fragrance,
Cultivated in snow, their season endures.
Do not place them in a bronze vase for display—
Only then can their fragrance fill the courtyard.

**Evening Scene**
River clouds faintly outline the sandbar,
Again, the temple bell rings from the tower.
I long to ride the wind with a long whistle,
As flocks of crows caw, separated by mist.

**Facing the Scene**
Beyond the tower, the great river flows,
Green mountains open across the shore.
Peak after peak of clouds cannot obscure them—
I myself return from the sea’s summit.

**Autumn Day, Gathering with Disciples at Xuanran Terrace for Wine and Song**
Clapping hands, whistling in the wind,
Clear songs fill the hall.
Water’s light floats the railing white,
Mountain qi enters the tower green.

Raising wine, we discuss profound principles,
Before the window, we chant Daoist scriptures.

**The Heavens Should Laugh Heartily**
The master and disciples forget all formality—
Each lets go in joyful abandon.

**Autumn Night, Reassembling with Disciples at Xuanran Terrace**
Fine rain beyond the gauze window,
The chirring of insects—too poignant to bear.
Clouds seal a thousand trees in darkness,
The night still, a single lamp glows green.

Who can utter forbidden lines?
None before us have ever tried.
I pluck a banana leaf to write,
Grass-script forming dragon shapes.

Such joy is rare this year—
Tonight, let us not squander it.
Listening to wind, listening to rain,
Discussing the Dao, discussing poetry.

Each sings *"The Rootless Tree"*—
No need to boast of rhyme-bound verse.
Unfettered by rules of law,
We chant in carefree delight.

**Moonlit Rivers and Mountains**
Rivers and mountains in the moon—sought within a painting,
Leaning on the pavilion, opening the window to gather far and near.
Peaks press into the clouds, deepening into night,
Bamboo tips brushed by dew, autumn’s weight congealing.

Insects chirr-chirr on mossy steps,
Lamp’s glow flickers upon treetops.
Gazing afar, banyan shade cradles evening mist,
Vague, misty trees veil the high tower.

**Autumn Evening**
The Milky Way faint in the night,
Autumn wind stirs the osmanthus grove.
Cool clouds linger at dawn along three paths,
Cold dew invades the tower.

Bamboo shadows stir lofty thoughts,
Mountain dwelling deepens the Dao’s intent.
Of late, no other words—
Worldly distractions no longer trouble the heart.

**Lamentable**
Lamentable—people of the world do not study immortality,
Fearing illness’s clinging through all four seasons.
How could they know a single qi is matchless?
When qi fills the body, life may be prolonged.

**Laughing Heartily**
Laughing heartily, singing loudly,
Dancing drunkenly through mist and waves,
Donning a fisher’s straw cloak, roaming rocky slopes,
At day’s end, the rivers and mountains brim with joy.

I pass beyond the slanting sun’s village—
Who knows I dance drunk in bliss?

**With Disciples, Awaiting Rain**
Today, great rain sweeps the southeast,
Locust wind and plum rain deeply stir the heart.
Heaven does not explain clearly—
Within this, yin and yang form a single qi.

**Hall of Bamboo Love**
White rain, pure wind,
Washed clean from the Peng Palace.
Jade blossoms cover the ground, fragrance drifting,
Wafting onto the bamboo screen.

In this triple-heat season,
The mortal world drowns in vexing heat.
How unlike our immortal realm’s bliss—
A tumbleweed flying over the sea.

**Delighted by Guangyu’s Arrival at Yueyun Tower**
Bound by fate, a thousand miles bring us together,
Unburdened, one body roams afar.
I love Layman Li of Langzhou—
He drifts here to Yueyun Tower.

**Joy, Joy, Joy**
Speak, speak, speak—joy, joy, joy!
The wind stills, the moon not yet risen,
The shoals gleam clear, autumn’s air solemn.
I have a Dao of feeling,
To speak of it in depths and shallows.

If one can shed all worldly vulgarity,
The primordial true qi will often warm the body.
Unafraid of wind and cold,
Unscathed by pestilence,
Years may be prolonged, descendants continued.
All things arise from the spirit—
When the spirit acts, great fortune is gained.

No talismans, no medicine needed,
Simply sweep away all celestial calamities—
Joy, joy, joy!

**Dawn Chant**
Atop Sunrise Peak at dawn,
Suddenly, the mountain temple’s drum hastens the planting.
At Fusang’s summit, the celestial rooster still crows,
A band of red clouds unfurls the dawn’s light.

**Instructing Disciples Zhu and Li**
You two are rare in this ancient age,
Withdrawing far from the city’s clamor.
A settled mind suits few desires,
Cultivating qi shuns excess speech.

Parting from Lang’s waters a thousand miles,
Dwelling once among fine mountains.
From now on, seek your original nature—
Thus escape the world’s snare.

**Inscription for Clan Member Dexuan’s Tomb**
A household of filial piety and brotherly love, the Hall of a Hundred Endurances,
Cultivating ancestral virtue, fragrance flows naturally.
Dexuan rests peacefully beneath Square Mountain,
His estate producing nine fragrant lingzhi.

**Instructing Liu, Bai Jiu, and Li Yuxi**
White wine and fishing rod—guests of the rivers,
Green mountains and Daoist robes—wind of the recluses.
Both of you are laughable,
Youthful yet bearded like old men.

Beyond the world, mist and rosy clouds are ancient,
By the river, the atmosphere is empty.
Early study the principles of purity—
Amid a few wisps of white cloud.

**Seeking the Secluded**
Elegant waters, elegant mountains—seeking elegant scholars,
Fine mountains, fine waters—delighting in fine guests.
By chance hearing a green simurgh’s call beyond the clouds,
One knows a Penglai visitor has arrived at the gate.

**Early Autumn Affairs, in the Style of Master Hui**
After new autumn’s new rain,
The moon rises, tender coolness born.
River’s reflection holds the sky’s azure,
Starlight illuminates vast clarity.

Leaning on the tower, blowing a jade flute,
Riding a crane to cross the Jasper Capital.
Coming and going without fixed abode,
Whistling freely, treading Peng and Ying.

**Seeing Off Langquan and Langshan Returning to Langzhong, Linked Verse with Daoist Bicheng**
Cloud-water wanderers like wild geese, Sanfeng,
In early spring, northward to Bicheng.
A thousand miles of mountains and passes, far—Sanfeng,
A single body of virtue, plump—Bicheng.

Unasking of the pavilion’s length—Sanfeng,
Who knows the world’s right and wrong?—Bicheng!
Drifting, coming and going—Sanfeng,
Willows by the riverbank sway gently—Bicheng.

**Early Mid-Spring, Instructing Disciples**
One year never repeats another,
Years and months like arrows loosed from a bow.
Beneath the flowers, a fine spring feast,
Rouse the poetic spirit to sing in harmony.

**Soaring Chant**
Chanting clearly at Yunmeng’s dawn,
Soaring past Dongting’s spring.
Drifting without fixed abode,
Swinging my arms, entering Emei.

**Haha!**
Who else is as carefree and refined?
—The Returning Daoist.

**Inscription for the Painting *Maiden Xian Listening to Maiden He Play the Sheng***
Treading Peng Island, ascending clouded skies,
Seeking the immortal of Green Mist Cave.
A melody from the jade sheng—how cold its tones!
Since parting, Lang Garden has passed a thousand years.

**Volume Six of the Complete Works of Master Zhang Sanfeng**
*Recompiled by Li Xiyue of Hanjia, the Long Yi Mountain Scholar*
*Respectfully inscribed by Zhang Daoyuan, styled Shen Shi*
*Published by Zhu Daosheng of Langzhong, styled Latecomer*
*Collated by nephew Ying Chuncheng and Zhu Zan, styled Suyuan*
*Son Huang Panxi*

**The Heavenly Mouth Chapter**
The ancients said: *"The sage speaks for Heaven."*
I am no sage—how could I presume to speak in Heaven’s stead?
Yet it is only to uphold the August Supreme Emperor,
Whose hidden virtue aids the people below.
To rouse the deaf and awaken the blind—
This is the radiant intent of His illumination!
To exhort goodness and correct transgressions—
This is the true cause of universal deliverance.
Though my tongue stammers and falters,
I do not shirk my dull roots;
Though the world teems with multitudes,
I beg you to heed my words.
Thus I compose these didactic essays, numbering several,
And name them *The Heavenly Mouth*,
In gratitude for the venerable Biweng’s exalted praise.

**The Orthodox Teaching Chapter**
From ancient times to now, there have been two teachings—no third.
What are these two? The orthodox and the heterodox.
Why no third?
There is only the One, only the Dao.
How then does it divide?
How does it become three?
Since the advent of Kong, Lao, and Muni,
Even unto the present age of Kong, Lao, and Muni,
Though it seems there are Kong, Lao, and Muni,
In truth, there are no Kong, Lao, or Muni.
Kong was fundamentally a Confucian,
Lao fundamentally a Daoist,
Muni fundamentally a Buddhist—
Yet where they diverge, they ultimately do not diverge.
Because they do not diverge,
They must converge.
Thus, they are neither Kong nor Lao,
Neither Lao nor Muni.
Muni, Kong, and Lao—
All are called the Dao.
Kong’s "cutting off the four,"
Lao’s "embracing the One,"
Muni’s "emptying the five"—
All are self-cultivation.
Kong’s "benevolence toward the people,"
Lao’s "aiding the world,"
Muni’s "delivering from suffering"—
All are benefiting others.
Self-cultivation and benefiting others—
Their aim is one.
Those who distinguish Kong, Lao, and Muni
Do so because they see names but not reality,
Or forms but not principles.
To see them as Kong, Lao, and Muni
Is not to see Kong, Lao, and Muni.
Though not Kong, Lao, and Muni,
They remain Kong, Lao, and Muni.
Kong, Lao, and Muni—
All were ancient sages.
The sages’ teachings
Take orthodoxy as their foundation.
Anything not orthodox
Is called a heterodox teaching.
The Yangists and Mohists of the Confucians,
The fangshi of the Daoists,
The demonic monks of the Buddhists—
These too are the three teachings.
Though divided into three,
They are but one heterodoxy.
Thus, those who divide the three teachings are foolish;
Those who distinguish orthodoxy from heterodoxy are wise.

**The Confucian Canon Chapter**
Beyond the Six Classics,
Those whose words may serve as models
Must be sought among Kong’s disciples.
They did not discourse on transcending the world,
Nor expound on esoteric scriptures,
Fearing people would fall into perilous abysses
Without true practice.
Kong and Yan’s aspiration
Was only that people would retire to seek their will
And practice righteousness to attain the Dao.
The Dao lies in aiding others—
Mountains and forests are no different from court and market.
The Dao lies in self-cultivation—
Court and market are unstained by mountains and forests.
Thus, their words brim with profound meaning,
Yet those who grasp them are rare.
The second passage of the *Great Learning*—
This is Kongzi’s self-cultivation.
"For benevolence, employ the four restraints"—
This is Master Yan’s refinement of the self.
Before the work is perfected, one does not leave the humble lane;
Once the work is mature, one does not forget the state.
Thus, they sought action in reclusion,
And attained reclusion in action.
In reclusion, there were Kong and Yan;
In action, there were also Kong and Yan.
Even in neither action nor reclusion,
There were still Kong and Yan.
Spiritual illumination resides within me;
Transformations follow the heart—
This is the true Great Dao.
Kongzi transmitted to Zengzi,
Zengzi to Zisi.
The *Doctrine of the Mean*—
Its Dao is wondrous and luminous.
Those who awaken to the mystery
Steal it away to realize the truth.
Like the sands of the Ganges,
After Zisi, only Mencius is esteemed.
Holding the heart and nurturing qi,
Neither aiding nor forgetting,
Filling heaven and earth,
Utmost in greatness and firmness—
All may be delivered.
Silently drawing it forth,
The subtlety of *haoran* qi—
Its oral transmission is hard to express.
Refuting the heterodox and aiding the orthodox,
Yang and Mo were overthrown.
I wish for scholars and commoners alike:
Seek not the truth on the Three Isles,
But take it from the *Four Books*.
Regard Yan, Zeng, Si, and Meng as enlightened teachers,
Take the roles of subject, minister, disciple, and friend as your practices,
Regard body, heart, nature, and destiny as mercury and lead,
And the refinement of righteousness and benevolence as ascension.
When cultivating the Dao, do not covet its use;
When nurturing the Dao, do not hasten its practice;
When attaining the Dao, you may then manifest it.
If the Dao cannot be manifested,
Drift away and return,
Transmit it to the famous mountains—
Its source and flow will naturally endure.

**The Chan Essence Chapter**
What is meant by "Shi" in "Shijiamouni"?
*"I favor ‘Shi,’ so I use it to open the teaching,
Taking ‘Shi’ to mean severing the ten thousand conditions."*
What is meant by "Buddha"?
The Great Being said:
*"I favor ‘Buddha,’ so I employ it to establish the teaching,
Taking ‘Buddha’ to mean awakening sentient beings."*
Thus have I heard: the Master Shi departed the world;
Thus have I heard: the Master Buddha awakened the world.
The entire canon, hundreds of scriptures,
All aim to transcend worldly defilements
And awaken those sunk in delusion.
Thus, Muni is pure,
And the Great Being attains purity.
Muni encompasses purity,
The Great Being universalizes purity.
Not clinging to purity,
Not destroying purity,
Not begrudging purity—
Even to the point of no purity, not purity,
Not purity, yet purity—
This is great purity,
This is perfect purity.
If one can chant the tide-sound,
One will surely attain a pure heart,
A prajñā heart.
But attaining prajñā,
One forgets prajñā.
If prajñā is not forgotten,
It is not prajñā.
Since it is not prajñā,
It cannot be called prajñā.
Not not-prajñā—
This is prajñā.
One who attains prajñā
Is called a Shi;
This may become a Shi,
This has the Shi of Shi,
This Shi is not the having of Shi,
This Shi naturally has the Shi of Shi.

This is called the Buddha,
This may become the Buddha,
This has the Buddha of Buddha,
This Buddha is not the having of the Buddha of Buddha,
This Buddha naturally has the Buddha of Buddha.

Thus is Muni,
Thus is the Great Being,
Thus even the śramaṇa bhikṣu.

Can one become a Shi without this?
No.
Can one become a Buddha without this?
No.
Why?
This Shi is the Shi;
not-Shi is not the Shi.
This Buddha is the Buddha;
not-Buddha is not the Buddha.
Why?
Beyond the Shi there is no Shi;
grasping the Shi makes the Shi.
Beyond the Buddha there is no Buddha;
grasping the Buddha makes the Buddha.
Why?
The Shi of Shi, the intent of Shi—
when both are without Shi-intent,
then is true Shi-intent.
The Buddha of Buddha, the thought of Buddha—
when both are without Buddha-thought,
then is true Buddha-thought.

Not-Shi yet Shi is the supreme vehicle,
Not-Buddha yet Buddha is the Great Vehicle.
The scriptural treasury of Shi and Buddha—
it is through Shi and Buddha that the treasury is formed,
this is called the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye.

**Mystic Sound Chapter**
Mystic learning takes virtue and power as its essence,
the Golden Elixir as its function,
and only then can one become an immortal.
There are five ranks of immortals,
but in truth, only four.

First, the Human Immortal.
The Human Immortal refines primordial essence to replenish primordial qi,
having cultivated the foundation of immortality.
Yet they can only nurture health
and do not transcend birth and death—
these are immortals among humans.

Second, the Earth Immortal.
The Earth Immortal refines primordial qi to congeal the inner elixir,
free from the affliction of leakage.
Yet they may walk on land
and do not leave the dusty realm—
these are immortals among the earth.

Third, the Divine Immortal.
The Divine Immortal refines primordial qi to transform primordial spirit,
attaining the wondrous power of divine penetration.
Water and fire cannot harm them;
they are also called Water Immortals.
When spirit is refined to return to emptiness,
they become Heavenly Immortals.
Thus, below Heavenly Immortals are Divine Immortals,
below Divine Immortals are Earth Immortals,
below Earth Immortals are Human Immortals,
and below Human Immortals,
there are only ghosts, no immortals.

Ghosts are pure yin,
Immortals are pure yang.
Humans possess half yin and half yang,
thus they do not escape birth and death.
Severing the yin half makes an immortal,
severing the yang half makes a ghost.
Therefore, humans exist between the possibility of immortality and ghostliness,
momentarily suspended between the two.
To escape this in-between state,
one must abide in the ranks of Heavenly and Divine Immortals.

Turn back to recognize the shore,
let go and leave the dust.
The myriad words of elixir scriptures
all reside within oneself.
Mistaking the self for the other
is to fall into heterodox paths.

The legacy of former sages
must be skillfully pondered.
It is neither metal nor stone,
neither mercury nor lead,
neither furnace nor cauldron,
neither woman nor man,
neither sun nor moon,
neither kun nor qian,
neither father nor mother,
neither dragon nor tiger,
neither crow nor hare,
neither female nor male.

Where lies the mystery?
The mystery lies in the mysterious place.

Where lies the wonder?
The wonder lies in the wondrous place.
I possess true transmission,
yet dare not speak recklessly;
people possess true sincerity,
yet do not shut their doors.
To broadly accumulate hidden merits
is to first become an immortal of the highest rank;
to broadly practice convenience for others
is to first establish the foundation of immortality;
to broadly cultivate cause and effect
is to first plant the root of immortality.
If one finds such a person to seek my Dao,
I shall willingly expound the supreme Dharma,
pointing out subtle words,
as if parting clouds and mist to behold the azure sky,
then depart with a long whistle.

This chapter delineates the ranks of immortals,
clear and luminous.
I only hope that people will accumulate hidden merits to seek true transmission,
for the Dao of divine immortals is truly not difficult to attain.

**The Five Virtues Chapter**
Human life possesses five virtues,
which I have likened to the five phases of Heaven and Earth.
The five classics of the human body:
benevolence pertains to wood, the liver;
righteousness pertains to metal, the lungs;
propriety pertains to fire, the heart;
wisdom pertains to water, the kidneys;
trustworthiness pertains to earth, the spleen.
Thus, not one of the five virtues can be lacking,
just as not one of the five classics can be severed,
or one of the five phases cut off.
All say wood cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no benevolence?
Without benevolence, one must lack the thought of nurturing and fostering,
their liver already severed,
and wood withers and dries!
All say metal cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no righteousness?
Without righteousness, one must lack the consideration of expediency,
their lungs already severed,
and metal rusts and dulls!
All say fire cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no propriety?
Without propriety, one must lack the radiance of brightness,
their heart already severed,
and fire wanes and extinguishes!
All say water cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no wisdom?
Without wisdom, one must lack the clarity of purity,
their kidneys already severed,
and water darkens and dries!
All say earth cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no trustworthiness?
Without trustworthiness, one must lack the sentiment of mutual trust,
their spleen already severed,
and earth crumbles and collapses!

Thus, one who would be human
must first possess the five virtues of the heart,
and only then the five classics of the body.
Benevolence does not sever the liver, and its qi flourishes;
righteousness does not sever the lungs, and their qi is balanced;
propriety does not sever the heart, and its qi is luminous;
wisdom does not sever the kidneys, and their qi is numinous;
trustworthiness does not sever the spleen, and its qi is awakened.
Virtue envelops the body,
the body envelops the heart,
the body serves the heart’s use,
and the heart is illuminated by virtue.
This body is the heart,
this heart is the body,
these five virtues are the five classics.
When virtue is lost, the classics are lost;
when virtue is perfected, the body is perfected;
when the body is perfected, the classics are perfected,
and only then can one assist and harmonize with the five phases of Heaven and Earth.

**The Filial Conduct Chapter**
The osmanthus palace arrays its pillars with couplets,
and of a hundred deeds, filial piety comes first.
The cultured ancestor could practice filial piety,
his fragrance enduring for ten thousand myriad years.
Thus, in his own person,
attaining the Dao is attaining immortality,
attaining immortality is attaining sagehood,
attaining sagehood is attaining worthiness.
His radiance opens the sun and moon,
his love and longing connect Earth and Heaven.
If the people of the world desire to emulate filial piety,
filial piety is truly the origin of a hundred deeds.
Yu Shun ordered the hundred offices,
with filial piety foremost in illumination and exaltation.
King Wen of Zhou rectified the hundred measures,
with filial piety foremost in reputation and command.
Master Zeng valued the three ways,
yet serving parents was uniquely great.
Min Ziqian excelled in the four virtues,
yet serving his mother was uniquely earnest.
Since ancient times, there have been many filial children,
and I shall briefly expound a few.
Do not regard this as a mere classic of filial piety,
but observe it as a model of filial conduct.
Some carried rice on their backs,
some left behind savory broth,
some gazed at white clouds,
some wore patched robes,
some wept until their strength waned,
some cherished fresh tangerines,
some prayed and bamboo sprouted,
some moved stones to release springs,
some remembered the crow’s return to feed its parents,
some entreated fish to leap from the abyss,
some held the Anyang decree,
some set aside the *Liao’e* ode,
some thought of their parents and ceased feasting,
some served their parents and carved their cheeks—
these were all streams of worthies and sages,
how could they lack words of virtuous merit!
Yet among their hundred fine deeds,
none surpass the entanglement of filial piety.
Only filial piety can make one a friend,
shifting filial piety can become loyalty;
only filial piety molds one’s wife,
and through filial piety, one gains trust among friends.
One act of filial piety encompasses the five relationships,
and you must know that filial piety can be emulated.
Supreme filial piety lies in the heart,
love and longing reveal one’s true nature;
moderate filial piety lies in the body,
serving and nurturing should be earnest and diligent.
Though one may speak of filial piety with their mouth,
they must be able to act as they speak.
Though one may feign filial piety on their face,
they deceive both others and their kin.
The virtue of filial piety is boundless,
each thought gains a portion,
portion by portion and inch by inch,
inch by inch it reaches the heavenly spirits.
Filial piety upon filial piety,
sincerity upon sincerity,
I compose this *Classic of Filial Piety*,
the great classic within the classics.

**The Debauchery and Evil Chapter**
The osmanthus palace inscribes its pillars with verses,
and of ten thousand evils, debauchery is foremost.
Thus, the retributions for evil are many,
but none are as shameful as the retribution for debauchery.
Heaven’s punishments are each extraordinary,
Heaven’s penalties are each manifest.
Some seduce another’s wife,
and their own wife is seduced by another;
some embrace another’s daughter,
and their own daughter is embraced by another;
some are killed for their lewdness;
some are cut off from descendants for their lewdness;
some lose their family’s wealth and property;
some forfeit their official rank and longevity;
some bear base and ignoble descendants;
some follow deceit and fraud to their ruin—
the retributions for debauchery are endlessly tangled,
and brush and ink cannot fully recount them.
Who can this evil be spared?
Why do they not turn back!
Some say the debauched are full,
and only when their sins are complete does retribution arrive,
yet the moment one is debauched, retribution follows,
for Heaven’s mirror brooks no partiality.
One case of a lewd ghost
is truly lamentable, truly lamentable!
I exhort you, people of the world,
do not violate the precept against debauchery.
What you have not seen, do not think of;
what you have seen, do not act wantonly toward.
Do not jest with virgins,
do not trifle with chaste widows.
When you encounter another’s wife or concubine,
regard them as sisters.
Do not defile maidservants or slaves,
do not frequent prostitutes or actresses.
The rouge and powder of a moment are flowers,
but one’s spirit scatters in an instant.
To preserve the body, one must emerge from the pit;
to escape suffering, one must cross the shore.
Even with your own wife and concubines,
intimate passions should also be moderated.
If you desire to bear upright and dignified children,
you must establish respectful boundaries.

On occasions of sacred deities’ birthdays, solar or lunar eclipses, the appointed days for stove sacrifices, inauspicious anniversary dates, times of dark and gloomy convergence, or during swift thunder and lightning, one must separate quilts and beds, or even beds and chambers.

Heavenly spirits observe such reverence and bestow blessings of their own accord. Celestial immortals honor such conduct, and those who seek the Dao may attain it. If one further refrains from all evil, one becomes a true hero of greatness.

**The Chapter on Giving and Retribution**

For wealthy and noble families, accumulating goodness is easy, yet seeking good retribution is not. It is not that goodness goes unrewarded, but that retribution is measured by its weight. For poor and humble families, accumulating goodness is difficult, yet receiving good retribution is not. It is not only that goodness is rewarded, but that retribution is likewise measured by its weight. As for those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor humble, their accumulation of goodness and receipt of retribution are also proportionally meted out.

In terms of monetary aid: for the wealthy and noble, a hundred taels yield ten merits; for the poor and humble, ten taels yield ten merits. In terms of aiding others: for the wealthy and noble, helping a hundred people yields ten virtues; for the poor and humble, helping ten people yields ten virtues. Those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor humble, should naturally be judged by the standard of the common man.

For the wealthy and noble to claim the standard of the common man is improper; to claim the standard of the poor and humble is even more so. What one generation amasses, the next dissipates; what one generation strengthens, the next weakens. Nevertheless, if the wealthy and noble perform good deeds appropriately, even a few hundred taels will surely bring great retribution—one need only expand and fulfill it. For the poor and humble to forcibly imitate the common man is improper; to forcibly imitate the wealthy and noble is even more so. Extravagant support invites sin, while cold and hunger deepen the resentment of wife and children. Yet if the poor and humble perform good deeds appropriately, even as their household teeters on collapse, great retribution will surely follow—one need only weigh and apply it judiciously.

Heaven does not fail the good. Yet if one dwells in wealth and nobility but begrudges resources, expecting meager retribution for great goodness or delayed retribution for swift goodness, and thus neglects to cultivate virtue, calamity will inevitably strike, and misfortune will not be rare. A once-prominent clan may vanish in an instant like melting ice, and a lordly gate may crumble to ashes upon a second glance—all of this kind. If one dwells in poverty and humility yet boasts of merit and retribution, expecting scant reward for little goodness or delayed reward for delayed goodness, and thus treats virtue lightly, the calamities summoned will be stranger still, and the misfortunes encountered even more severe. Amid the desolation of war and the ravages of plague, all stem from this. Those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor humble, follow the same principle.

Why is this so? Those who dwell in wealth and nobility possess the influence and authority to accumulate goodness. Even if one’s goodness goes unrewarded in this life, it is one’s due—clothed in abundance, fed in abundance, renowned and esteemed. To enjoy such peace and prosperity, passing it to one’s descendants, is itself a form of good retribution. Yet if one scorns goodness and refuses to act, expecting retribution while indulging in reckless greed, Heaven will transfer one’s authority to the virtuous without the slightest hesitation.

Those who dwell in poverty and humility lack the influence and authority to accumulate goodness. For such a person to perform even small acts of kindness is no extraordinary feat—cherishing words and objects, loving others and all things. If one consistently cultivates such habits, piling earth into mountains and gathering water into seas, good retribution will surely follow. Yet if one neglects goodness and refuses to act, expecting retribution while dulling one’s heart and will, Heaven will deepen one’s hardship to punish the wicked, showing no trace of partiality.

Thus is good retribution; thus is evil retribution. Those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor humble, may observe this. You who are rich or noble, you who are poor or humble, reflect upon it.

Alas! The principle of giving and retribution is seen most clearly by sages and worthies, and handled most profoundly by immortals and buddhas. Even the chivalrous may sometimes exceed proper bounds, yet if the common people could but emulate such chivalry, it would suffice.

In my youth, I delighted in giving, and by good fortune ascended to the Nine Heavens. Thus, I have thoroughly discerned the retribution between Heaven and humanity. How could this be mere abstruse theory? Even the heart of Heaven operates thus. Yet what does Heaven say?

**The Chapter on Fullness and Decline**

The affairs of the world and the state are ever subject to waxing and waning, obscurity and clarity, fullness and decline. The common people attribute this to the workings of Heaven, while the enlightened ascribe it to the human heart. The principle is sound, the words pure—what need have I to expound further? Yet in this world, there are those who decline before reaching fullness, or who, though poised to decline, do not. The reasons for this I shall earnestly elucidate to admonish the world.

The momentum of a state’s power, secure at its height, may yet face peril in a single generation, and sigh over its impending ruin in the next. What holds true for the state may be applied to the individual. If this is decline, why do some revive through restoration? If this is not fullness, why do great crises suddenly arise, only to halt at a certain point?

For it is this: failing to draw near to worthy talent allows treacherous villains to corrupt governance; neglecting the cultivation of poetry and ritual leads descendants into extravagance and recklessness. In times of peace and prosperity, one must remain mindful of treading perilous paths. Anticipating danger and taking precautions, the noble person should remain vigilant to fulfill Heaven’s allotted span. Yet Heaven has no fixed span—if one daily maintains fullness, even ten thousand years may be attained.

The vital energy of a state, chaotic at its nadir, may yet revive as its fortune wanes and waxes anew, its power declining only to rise again. If this is not decline, why does it teeter like eggs stacked precariously? If it has already declined, why does it once more enjoy stability and peace?

For it is this: reining in the reins at the edge of a cliff may avert disaster; turning back upon witnessing the scene may extend the dynasty’s legacy. Even in the smallest pleasures of feasting and drinking, one cannot expect unending joy. Extrapolating from the minor to the major, the noble person should awaken sharply to avert Heaven’s predestined calamities. Yet Heaven has no fixed calamities—if one daily guards against decline, even the mediocre may endure.

Ah! The heart of Heaven resides in human affairs—why then do people not strive toward goodness?

**On Praise and Blame**
Why do others blame me? Why do they praise me? Why do they blame others? Why do they praise others? One who craves praise yet falls short of merit invites blame; one who guards against blame and corrects their faults earns praise. Thus, those who blame or praise me do so without cause, while I bring blame or praise upon myself with cause. Those who blame or praise others do so without reason, while others invite blame or praise with reason.

I love that all under Heaven seek no praise yet act in ways worthy of praise; I despise that all under Heaven fear no blame yet indulge in conduct that invites it. I am ashamed that all under Heaven, unaware of praise and blame, fade into obscurity. To fade into obscurity is to self-destruct without others’ blame.

Those who, in life, self-destruct through their faults will surely be praised by others; those who, in life, self-aggrandize through their merits will surely be blamed by others. Yet if praise exceeds reality, the wind of mutual flattery will arise; if blame exceeds reality, those who demand perfection deserve condemnation. Let the world take heed and be warned.

**On Longevity and Shortness**
Who is fated for long life? Who for short? The August One gazes below—no separate eye discerns. To teach all beings to live long, the great earth must teem with life. Thus, benevolence brings longevity, wickedness invites calamity; merit brings longevity, faults shorten life; nurturing brings longevity, dissipation scatters one’s essence.

Even immortals, Buddhas, sages, and worthies cannot escape kalpas—singing as speech, they summon the lost to return.

**On Prosperity and Adversity**
The prosperous know no endless sorrow; the sorrowful lack cultivated virtue. Flourishing and withering are but spring and autumn—yet I dwell in both, free in concealment or display. Life rushes past like an arrow—why rejoice in prosperity? Why sigh at adversity?

Circumstances may bind, but not the hero; fate may be endured, so play idly. Reading to cultivate the Dao, one’s noble qi coils like a dragon. With Yan Hui’s gourd and Zengzi’s zither, Confucius would approve; with Fu Yue’s zither and Mi Heng’s robe, I too may follow.

The dragon in the hut soars to the clouds; the donkey by the lake roams carefree. Clouds emerge to bring timely rain; streams recede to visit the pine and peach immortals. Or, without ambition for office, one may lean on a staff like Wang Zhi—why torment oneself to death in the weeds?

**On Character**
The boundaries of human character must be clearly discerned. Some possess an upright qi, standing apart from the crowd—others call them arrogant, but I call them resolute. Some dwell in humble light, indistinguishable from the world—others call them fickle, but I call them harmonious. Some roam freely, following their nature—others call them lazy, but I call them at ease. Some chant and sing as they please, following Heaven’s decree—others call them mad, but I call them enlightened. Some hold themselves with solemn dignity, their bearing stern—others call them haughty, but I call them dignified. Some establish themselves with simplicity, their nature steadfast—others call them dull, but I call them unadorned. Some distinguish right from profit, free of self-interest—others call them affected, but I call them principled. Some possess lofty aspirations, untouched by dust—others call them eccentric, but I call them noble. Some exude warmth and harmony, though unversed in letters—others call them vulgar, but I call them refined. Some embrace purity as their bond, ignorant of scriptures and repentance—others call them foolish, but I call them awakened. Some eat and drink no differently, untouched by cold or heat—others call them strange, but I call them immortal.

In the mingling of worthy and unworthy, some appear similar yet differ in essence—one must observe closely.

Do not thin others’ hearts while thickening your own, belittle others’ hearts while prizing your own, deny others’ hearts while clinging to your own—then the spirit of the perfected will emerge. Shun lived in the mountains, differing little from others, yet upon hearing a single good word or seeing a single good deed, he shone like a crimson beacon in the sky.

**On Joyful Living**
An old man from Ancheng said to Lord Weicheng: “I hear that to live in an age of peace, one must be a man of peace—neither above nor below, dwelling in ease and benevolence. Do you know the joys of such a life? Let me compose a brief ode to describe them.

Red dust rolls, the bitter sea surges.
Follow my path, guard my conduct;
Nurture my vastness, preserve my loftiness.
Preserve great harmony, dispel worldly cares;
Quell strife, temper restless qi.
Endure cold to deepen learning and cultivation;
Forget desires, dwell in the grove.
As an official, avoid transgressions;
As a scholar, escape resentment.
Teach children to shun debauchery and gambling;
Instruct women to keep the household solemn.
Farming yields no shortage for taxes;
Study neglects no moral garden.
Drink communal wine to cure deafness,
Become the great toe of the people.
Dignified in bearing, ancient in appearance;
Unfettered in spirit, whole in essence.
Amid the clamor of right and wrong,
All grievances vanish.
Able to release life and abstain from killing,
One nurtures nature and prolongs years.
Discuss maxims with village elders;
Teach the young to weigh deeds and faults.
Perfect yourself to perfect others,
Transforming thousands, ten thousand faces.
Spread a mat in the thatched hall,
Seat the mountain elder as guest of honor.
Plant lotuses in the pond, the gentleman’s flower;
Cultivate chrysanthemums by the fence, as Tao Yuanming did.
Let plum blossoms perfume the mountain soil;
Fill the ravine with the recluse’s bamboo.
Content wherever one is—
Is this not joy beyond joy?

Now you, sir, wear a double frown, a heart of stagnant blood.
Your feet tread the marketplace,
Your body cast aside the springs and rocks.”

Entering yet finding no peace, departing yet gaining no benefit.
Greedy for gain and fond of strife,
Ever scheming, ever gluttonous.
Grinding against the dusty marketplace,
Watching the sunset fade to nothing.”

The man of Dangerous City then sighed deeply: “Alas!
The immortal elder’s teaching has brought me to this point!
I humbly receive his instruction.”
With a deep bow, he withdrew.

**The Chapter on Yielding**

In a chamber of harmony, a family of accumulated virtue,
West wall and east hall—fit places for inscribed maxims.
Take, for instance, the matter of enduring loss:
Most men find it unjust.
Yet if we can practice forbearance,
We nurture harmony for ourselves
And lay up virtue for our children and grandchildren.
Here, I distill the profound sayings of sages, worthies, and wise men
Into a few lines, to exhort others.

Some say:
*“What benefits others benefits oneself,
What suits others suits oneself.
If I benefit others at my own expense,
If I suit others at my own cost.”*

Some say:
*“Those who endure loss enjoy abundant fortune,
Those who profit excessively always lose in the end.”*

Some say:
*“If everyone must win,
Who in the world is left to bear the loss?”*

Some say:
*“Heaven and earth are governed by the law of fullness and emptiness;
When one has endured every loss, the calamity is exhausted.”*

I, too, have a saying:
*“When I have endured much loss, Heaven cannot bear it—
Old Heaven will surely grant me advantage.”*

Disciples, take heed!
Those who endure loss never truly suffer it.

**The Chapter on Loyalty and Empathy**

Loyalty and empathy—these are the single thread transmitted by the Proclaimed Sage.
What is this “single thread”?
Loyalty is the essence, empathy the application.
“Loyalty” (*zhong*) means centering the heart;
“Empathy” (*shu*) means treating others as one would oneself.
Does not the meaning of “establishing oneself to establish others” lie herein?

Loyalty permeates empathy.
To practice empathy as the Way of benevolence (*ren*)
Is to refrain from imposing what one does not desire—
Thus the Heavenly heart remains undisturbed by human desires.
To practice empathy in the world
Is to endure offense without retaliation—
Thus the human heart remains free from violent opposition.
To practice empathy in governance
Is to refrain from imposing what one detests—
Thus the minister’s heart avoids cruel policies.

The principles of sages and worthies flow back to their source,
Truly fit to be practiced throughout one’s life.

If one desires only to follow one’s own heart
And not the hearts of others,
Then the heart will surely generate
A bias for oneself and against others,
A preference for oneself and disregard for others,
A concern for oneself and indifference to others,
A pursuit of self-interest at others’ expense,
A drive to succeed at others’ failure.
Such a heart is not the heart of others—
And if it is not the heart of others,
How can it be one’s own heart?
Though one may desire to follow one’s own heart,
Greed harms it;
Though one may not desire to follow one’s own heart,
Resentment corrupts it.
When the heart is corrupted, it is lost.
When the heart is lost, there is no center.
When the center is gone, the root of benevolence dies—
No wonder such a heart lacks empathy.

Thus, those who are disloyal also fail to grasp the thread.
I urge you, scholars,
To seek the intent of this single thread,
To preserve its truth—
Then you will not be traitors to the gate of Confucius.

**The Chapter on Emptiness and Nothingness**

Emptiness and nothingness—this is the shared teaching of Laozi and the Buddha.
What is emptiness?
An empty heart.
When the heart is empty, the spirit is clear;
When the spirit is clear, nature is wise.
From this arise great liberation and profound awakening.

What is nothingness?
No-self.
When there is no self, there are no others;
When there are no others, there are no desires.
From this arise great purity and boundless joy.

Now, my two disciples,
You do not understand emptiness and nothingness,
But only probe into “solid existence.”
The term “solid existence” may sound fine,
Yet in the end, how many are led astray by it!
Daily seeking the tangible, discoursing on gold and stone—
Nothing is gained.
Daily seeking the existent, pondering Chan verses—
The six senses are defiled.
Of the infinite sands of the Ganges,
Who attains the first *paramita*?

I pity your ignorance and open your wisdom.
Observe how an empty heart leads to wisdom—
Know that emptiness can grasp the real.
Observe how no-self leads to no desire—
Know that nothingness can encompass being.

Confucius abandoned the self,
Yan Hui purified his heart—
Even the Confucians valued this.
How much more should you?

**The Chapter on Nurturing Life**

Of all human desires, none surpasses the desire for life.
To attain life, one must value it;
To value life, one must never treat it lightly.
Sacrificing oneself to fulfill benevolence,
Offering one’s life in peril—
This is not treating life lightly.
Preserving life in ordinary times,
Using it in such moments—
This is not vain existence.
Though one may die, one yet lives.
Only those who value life can become
Loyal ministers, righteous scholars,
Chaste women, steadfast maidens.

If one lives in times of peace,
Encounters an age of prosperity,
Whether noble or humble,
Fulfills filial piety and loyalty,
Becomes a venerable elder of the state,
A paragon among men—
Then one who cherishes life must know how to nurture it.

The discourse on nurturing life differs from that of cultivating the true.
Cultivating the true can escape calamity—this is the Dao.
Nurturing life can prolong years—this is technique.
Yet without understanding the principles of Heaven, Earth, and humanity,
Past and present,
One will never find a verified method.

The people of antiquity,
With their unadorned customs,
Few in cares, few in thoughts,
Few in words, few in laughter,
Few in sights, few in sounds,
Clothed in coarse garments, eating simple fare,
Unknowing and unperceiving—
Thus they preserved their true nature
And lived long lives.

The people of today,
With their growing vanity,
Many in cares, many in thoughts,
Many in words, many in laughter,
Many in sights, many in sounds,
Clothed in finery, eating rich foods,
Their wills and spirits dissipated—
Thus they harm their natures
And meet early deaths.

The harmony of Heaven’s Way lies in return:
The sun, though slanting, returns to noon;
The moon, though waning, returns to fullness;
The rain, though ceasing, returns to clarity;
The thunder, though roaring, returns to hibernation.
Thus it retains its inexhaustible spirit,
Perpetuating the celestial cycle in constant renewal.

The disharmony of the human way lies in excessive depletion:
Essence is spent in dissipation,
Qi is lost in deficiency,
The spirit’s movement never ceases,
The body’s form cannot be preserved.
Thus it is difficult to restore an exhausted self,
And one lingers in the world but a brief morning and evening.

Thus, in nurturing life,
Medicine and diet come after,
Preservation comes first—
One may learn from Heaven’s Way,
Or one may learn from the ancients.

**Five Kalpas Chapter**
Alas, how sorrowful!
All humans are bound to the Five Kalpas.
What are the Five Kalpas?
Birth, aging, sickness, death, and suffering.
Must one not be born?
One should be born upright, born justly,
Not born in delusion.
To be born as a sage or worthy—even if one dies young—is still to have lived,
With radiant spirit in the world,
A name that endures,
A fragrance that lingers—
How is this different from immortals or buddhas?
Yet there are those born in evil,
Born in violence,
Born in cruelty:
After one life, they shall not be born again,
Or rather, they *will* be born,
But born into kalpa after kalpa,
All falling into evil destinies,
Enduring the uninterrupted torments of hell.
Though they wish not to be born, they cannot escape.

Birth is the first kalpa.
Thus, sinking into the world,
Struggling in the human realm,
Unknowing of repentance,
Unmindful of change—
Leisurely, one ages:
This is the second kalpa.
Thus, essence depleted, form withered,
Spirit gone, qi exhausted,
Medicine cannot restore,
Nurture cannot revive—
Weakly, one falls ill:
This is the third kalpa.
Thus, impermanence arrives suddenly,
The final hour has come,
Where is one’s home? Who are one’s wife and children?
Hastily, one dies:
This is the fourth kalpa.
Thus, evil must be repaid,
Transgressions must be repaid,
One drifts through the netherworld,
Weeping and wailing in anguish—
This is the utmost suffering:
The fifth kalpa.
Fortunate if rebirth comes one day,
Yet one’s fate may bear the blade of war,
Or the disasters of water and fire,
Or the afflictions of myriad illnesses,
Or the hardships of endless poverty—
Still one will wander within the Five Kalpas without end,
Not to mention the knife mountains and hells.
Those who fall into this kalpa
Cannot dissolve their sins through karma or merit.
Thus, in this one life,
One must cultivate goodness and accumulate blessings,
Return to the root and restore the origin—
Only then may one ascend to the Terrace of Spring,
Or together enter the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
To be born is to attain long life,
To attain long life is to transcend birth,
To transcend birth is to be unborn,
To be unborn is to be undying,
To be undying is to achieve liberation.
Let all people take heed!

**Revering the Divine Chapter**
The divine—how wondrously it moves all things!
The Supreme Lord established teachings through the divine way,
Thus the divine truly governs good and evil.
All who are wise, bright, upright,
Are entrusted with the divine’s authority.
Heavenly spirits are *shen*,
Presiding over the guiding of all things;
Earthly spirits are *qi*,
Presiding over the sustaining of all things.
Such is the vast virtue of the divine—
The people receive it daily yet remain unaware.
Only by fully exhausting the human to align with Heaven and Earth
May one be deemed sufficient.

As for the sacred peaks and rivers, suburban altars,
Temples and shrines—
Those who erect steles and carve statues
Do so to revive the ancient spirits.
With towering halls and resplendent majesty,
All who gaze upon them cannot but stand in solemn reverence.
Yet when incense burns brightly, those who pray for blessings multiply;
When supplications grow frequent, those who seek fortune arrive—
How could the divine be deceived by mortals?
The origins of the divine are not uniform,
But all arise from the upright *qi*.

As the *Lu Yu* states:
*“The sage kings established sacrifices:
Those who enacted laws for the people were sacrificed to,
Those who died in service were sacrificed to,
Those who labored to stabilize the state were sacrificed to,
Those who averted great disasters were sacrificed to,
Those who warded off great calamities were sacrificed to.”*
Moreover, mountains, rivers, and the altars of soil and grain
All rendered great merits to the people.

For *“enacting laws for the people”*—
Originally, no repayment was expected;
*“Dying in service”*—
Originally, no gratitude was hoped for;
*“Laboring to stabilize the state”*—
Originally, no favor was sought;
*“Averting great disasters,” “warding off great calamities”*—
Originally, no entreaty was awaited;
Spreading merit and virtue among the people—
Originally, no prayers were required.
Even in the solemn rites of spring and autumn,
Or frequent fasts and offerings,
The ancestral temple’s purpose is but to pray to the divine
To protect our lord and state—
Yet this concerns not the self;
Or to pray to the divine
To protect our parents—
Yet this concerns not the self;
Or to pray to the divine
To bless the people and all things—
Yet this concerns not the self;
Or to pray to the divine
To deliver the lingering souls of the departed—
Yet this concerns not the self.
Moreover, one purifies the body,
Cleanses the mind,
Calms the thoughts,
Purifies the heart and liver,
Reveres the heart to revere the divine—
Thus, without seeking blessings, one naturally attains them.
Therefore, revering the divine
Is not as wondrous as revering one’s own heart.
The human heart is the divine,
The divine is the heart.
Only without shame in the heart
Can one be without shame before the divine.
One may face the divine,
And still face the heart—
Yet the divine is not separate from the heart.
It dwells in your chamber,
It dwells in your heart.
Just as the divine of Heaven abides in the sun,
Wherever the sunlight reaches, what place is not illuminated?
The divine of the human heart abides in the eyes—
Wherever the gaze falls, what thing is not seen?
Yet people seek to flatter the divine,
Hoping to erase their sins—
How could this be possible?

Beware:
The way of revering the divine has two paths—
The obsequious flattery of the vulgar is not among them.
The superior person maintains a heart of uprightness and magnanimity,
Establishes merit and conduct with profound sincerity.
In all places of dwelling,
They fear the divine’s scrutiny.
Blessings and felicity
Still arise from divine thought—
Such a person,
Though they never burn incense or hold candles,
Nor bow reverently at temple gates,
Has already attained the great way of revering the divine.
The middling person maintains a heart of caution and respect,
Speaking of the divine with trembling reverence.
When good thoughts arise,
They are spurred by the divine’s encouragement.
With merit and virtue,
Their heart bears the divine’s protection—
Such a person,
Though they may fast, bathe, and pay homage to bodhisattvas,
May be said to have grasped the lesser way of revering the divine.
As for those who outwardly feign humility
While inwardly harboring great wickedness,
Rushing about on the first and fifteenth days—
The divine will say:
*“You have come at last—
I have been seeking you!”*

"Do not flatter Me, do not profane Me—if you offer Me incense, I shall bind you in chains. Return and reform your heart; perhaps then it may yet be acceptable!"

**On Loving Others**
Of all things that live, none is more spiritually endowed than humankind. Having been granted such spiritual endowment over other beings, one must cherish life. Do not ensnare others with schemes, do not harm others with weapons, do not poison others with drugs, do not oppress others with power. Those who ensnare, harm, poison, or oppress others will face the visible punishments of the state and the invisible retribution of Heaven—none shall escape.

Consider how even creatures that fly and speak or dance, plants that bear fragrance or color, animals that can be tamed or delighted in, and hidden beings that can be nurtured or amused are still cherished by people. How much more precious, then, is a human life! Now I exhort you, people of the world: live together in harmony, do not oppress one another. In all your comings and goings, reflect upon the virtue of loving others, the merit of completing others, the deeds of loving others, the deeds of completing others, the benefits of loving others, the benefits of completing others. For in completing another’s name, you complete your own name; in completing another’s merit, you complete your own merit; in completing another’s deeds, you complete your own deeds; in completing another’s benefit, you complete your own benefit—all is love.

In completing another’s name and merit, deeds and benefit, do not obscure the loyalty of loyal ministers, do not usurp the achievements of meritorious officials, do not slander the chastity of women of integrity, do not defame the purity of young maidens, do not envy another’s ability nor falsely claim it as your own, do not resent another’s talent nor conceal it, do not hide another’s goodness nor steal it, do not spread another’s evil nor imitate it, do not secretly obstruct another’s advancement, do not recklessly erase another’s writings, do not ruin another’s grand undertakings, do not undermine another’s good deeds, do not sabotage another’s noble plans, do not diminish another’s wealth or longevity, do not seize another’s land, do not meddle with another’s property, do not aid villains in seizing the geomantic blessings of the virtuous, do not ally with petty men to lead astray the descendants of the noble. The compassion of universal kinship is too vast to enumerate fully.

Thus, the Everlasting Heavenly Worthy tirelessly admonishes: do not humiliate the good and upright, do not deceive the poor and destitute, do not separate father and child, do not divide flesh and blood, do not break marriages, do not mock the deaf and blind. Furthermore, rescue those in peril, aid those in urgent need, pity the orphaned, tolerate others’ faults, relieve suffering, provide for the hungry and cold, support your kin, assist neighbors and friends, show compassion to the orphaned and widowed, respect the elderly, and care for the poor—all these are acts of loving others.

Alas! Heaven has created countless beings to serve as the ground for the benevolent to practice benevolence and the virtuous to accumulate virtue. If one can extend the heart broadly and protect and nurture the multitudes, then those who dwell in wealth and nobility and love others will surely enrich their descendants, while those who dwell in poverty and lowliness and love others will surely attain prominence. Heaven blesses the good, the Emperor favors the virtuous—since ancient times, such blessings have been most abundant and swift. Therefore, to those who wish to understand the Dao of living in the world, I still urge: "Love others."

**On Medicine**
The Dao of medicine can either preserve a nation or sicken it; medicine in the world can either save lives or take them. One cannot be careless in this art. Within it lies principle, its study is inexhaustible, and its practice knows no end. Medicines are categorized as sovereign, minister, assistant, and courier; illnesses are distinguished as deficient or excessive, chronic or acute. While all physicians may speak of these, few truly understand them.

The sages’ learning was profound, yet their aspirations remained humble; their virtue was lofty, yet their hearts were modest. Those who practice the art of medicine should be the same. Do not underestimate yourself, do not mislead yourself, do not deceive yourself. To deceive yourself is to deceive others; to mislead yourself is to mislead others; to underestimate yourself is to underestimate others—such sins will be visited upon your own person.

Thus, in this path, achieving merit is easy, but incurring faults is also easy; accumulating blessings is difficult, but inviting misfortune is not. To seek merit without fault, blessings without misfortune, one must hold oneself in vigilant restraint. The subtleties of pulse and principle are profound—those with shallow learning cannot grasp them.

Now I exhort you, physicians: when you approach a patient’s bedside, first inquire about their history—do not experiment with medicine on them. Now I exhort you, patients: before the physician, first clarify the origins of your illness—do not gamble your life to test the physician. To gamble your life to test the physician is your own fault; to experiment with medicine on others is the physician’s fault.

Furthermore, when aiding those in critical condition, do not inflate your fees; when saving the destitute, do not calculate payment. If you can clearly discern the symptoms, proceed to rescue them; if you cannot, defer to those more skilled—this is the accumulation of steadfast and sincere goodness.

I further urge you, scholars of the Confucian tradition: study medical classics extensively, delve deeply into the principles of medicine, do not hoard knowledge nor act recklessly—benefit yourself and others. Fan Wenzheng and Lu Xuangong, as ministers of the state, devoted great attention to medicine. How can one neglect the Dao of medicine?

**On Physiognomy and Divination**
The superior person has a countenance, the inferior person has a countenance, but the mediocre person has no fixed countenance. The superior person has a fate, the inferior person has a fate, but the mediocre person has no fixed fate. Only the superior and inferior have natures that are difficult to change—this need not be discussed. Here, I speak only of you, the mediocre person, neither superior nor inferior, capable of rising or falling, sometimes rising, sometimes falling.

Neither rising nor falling is still falling; capable of rising or falling is still falling; sometimes rising, sometimes falling is still falling. Only by breaking free from the cycle of falling can one cease to be inferior. Countenance can be transformed by oneself, fate can be forged by oneself—this is no lie from the ancients.

Even those who practice physiognomy and divination can only read your appearance, not your heart; they can only calculate your fate, not your virtue. If they cannot read your heart, they cannot truly read your appearance; if they cannot calculate your virtue, they cannot truly calculate your fate.

Do not be deceived by physiognomists, for wisdom lies in understanding the heart behind the appearance. When the heart’s essence is upright, even a plain countenance is auspicious. Do not be haunted by diviners, for virtue transcends fate. When one’s moral nature is steadfast, even an ill-starred destiny becomes fortunate.

I urge you, people of the world, to read your own countenance and calculate your own fate. I urge you, physiognomists, to exhort others to cultivate the heart. I urge you, diviners, to exhort others to accumulate virtue. All discussions of bone and qi should be guided by the classics; all reckonings of fortune should be derived from canonical texts. When you speak of fate, speak also of virtue; when you discuss appearance, speak also of the heart. Embed moral transformation within the arts of physiognomy and divination, and the Three Patriarchs of the *Máyī* tradition and Master Zǐpíng will surely grant you sustenance.

**On Geomancy**

Heaven covers both good and evil; earth bears both good and evil; only the immortal masters conceal and store good and evil for heaven and earth. Heaven is impartial in its covering; earth is impartial in its bearing; the immortal masters are impartial in their grace. When people are swayed by selfish desires, their perception of principle becomes obscured.

Geomancy is the principle of heaven and earth. Where heavenly principle exists, human desire cannot intrude. Thus, this Dao can only be fully expounded by the sagely—those who are wise, enlightened, and upright. Yet today, people recklessly discuss fengshui, profaning the mountain spirits. They exhume the bones of their kin in pursuit of fortune and blessings, consulting geomancers to discern misfortune and auspiciousness. Some seek sites on behalf of others; some search for themselves. They swindle people of their wealth, demanding praise for their craft. With such hearts, how can they comprehend heavenly principle? It is no wonder that nine out of ten geomancers live in poverty!

When the immortal masters bestow a site, the virtuous receive virtue, and the wicked receive wickedness. The virtuous do not accept undeserved favor; the wicked do not bear unjust blame. This is the impartiality of principle, the clarity of the heart. When I have discussed geomancy with others, I have always coupled it with the law of retribution—this is the way it must be.

Those who govern the earth are immortal masters; their office is divine, not mundane. If people seek land from mortals, why not seek immortality from mortals as well?

**Admonitions for the World: On Guarding Against Lust**

The Dao of heaven is such that what goes forth must return—this principle is immutable, and its consequences are inevitable. Human beings, born between heaven and earth, are endowed with the finest essence of the Five Phases and possess the qi of uprightness. The proper union of husband and wife is the natural order of human relations. To transgress propriety and disrupt ethical norms is to descend to the level of beasts. Lewd and licentious conduct is something the virtuous must resolutely guard against.

Of all creatures in the world, none are more foolish than animals, yet the *suījiū* bird mates for life without confusion, and the solitary wild goose cries out but does not join the flock. How can humans, who bear the name of "human," be less enlightened than birds, failing to live up to their own nature?

Alas, these benighted masses do not understand that desire is emptiness, akin to an illusion or a bubble. They still covet the rosy cheeks and temples of beauty, indulging in entangling affections. Yet if they would but turn their gaze inward, they would awaken to the truth: all hearts are the same. When you lust after another’s wife or daughter, consider this—if your own wife or daughter were to consort with another, your heart would be pierced as with a thorn, your eyes would burn as with fire. You would strike out in fury, pursuing and slaying without hesitation. How then can you take pride in your own lust for others?

At such moments, heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, stand above you, bearing witness at your side. Their eyes blaze with anger, their teeth gnash in wrath, plotting retribution. Disaster will strike without delay. Reflecting on this, how can one not shudder with dread?

Moreover, abandoning oneself to the blade of lust, one’s head may be shattered at the neighbor’s threshold before the dream of the *yángtái* is even over, and the gates of the netherworld will already be sealed. The green-tinged blood and pale gore—all are the work of the allure of rouge and powder. The beauty was but a tiger in cosmetics—how can this not be believed?

Even if one escapes such extremes, the strong may cry out to the authorities, while the weak harbor hidden resentment. Families bear inexplicable shame; husbands and wives sever bonds of a lifetime. Death or survival becomes uncertain; calamities multiply. Some secretly plot revenge; others inflict covert harm. As for the loss of one’s children, the stain on one’s reputation—it becomes a tale told for generations.

The cruelty of murder extends only to one person, but the poison of lust is no less than killing that person across multiple lifetimes. Those who indulge in lust are themselves unprincipled. With their soft hearts and seductive bones, they cannot control others but are inevitably controlled by them. Thus, they abandon filial piety and fraternal duty for private passions, casting aside parents and siblings as if they were mere bystanders. Beyond this one obsession, they are utterly oblivious.

As a result, wives, concubines, and children lack proper supervision, and the inner chambers descend into filth and chaos. Though retribution unfolds silently, they remain utterly oblivious. Furthermore, those who indulge in lust will see their children die young and their descendants dwindle. Why? Because one’s descendants are sown by one’s own spirit and essence. When one’s finite essence is squandered on the endless flowers and willows of desire, it is like felling a tree with an axe—once the sap is exhausted, the fruit must wither. The frailty of one’s offspring is inevitable.

Generation after generation grows thinner, weaker, until the lineage is severed entirely. This is the natural consequence. The severity of the calamity of lust—how can it be fully described?

Alas! How fleeting is human life—barely a hundred years, a mere instant. Even those who disregard reputation and squander their lives must still care for their descendants and ensure the continuity of their ancestral sacrifices. If they would but consider this, they would have no time for regret—how then could they still seek pleasure and indulge their desires?

As for those in the empty gate who maintain pure conduct, or widows with hearts as cold as ice, they are not to be compared with the alluring temptresses of the world. It is not merely a matter of personal integrity or the well-being of one’s family—such conduct is simply impermissible, and no further elaboration is needed.

For those of resolve, let purity of heart be the foundation, shame the instrument, perseverance the guard, and vigilance the aspiration. Hold fast without laxity; cultivate with clarity. Consign all licentious texts to the flames; sever ties with dissolute companions. Concentrate your spirit and energy to pursue what is truly beneficial. Then you will see every name established, every profit reaped. The five blessings will gather upon you. Is this not the immutable principle, the inevitable consequence?

Thus is the exhortation. This is the original work. It was once published by Sun Nianqu of Changzhou in *The Complete Human Measure*.

**Admonition Against Licentiousness**

Heaven and Earth give birth to humanity, endowing us with the finest essence of the Five Phases and the vital essence of the Two Great Forces. Husband and wife—such is the constant Way of human relations; wanton dalliance and fleeting passions—these are the crooked paths of depravity. Should one peer over walls or bore through holes, transgressing principle and confounding human ethics, it would be as the boar’s borrowed coupling, the dog’s indiscriminate congress, the wild mandarin ducks, the doves nesting in confusion. Thus, though born human, one would be ranked with beasts. Moreover, even the dullest creatures know their mates: the *guan* and *ju* birds take their proper places without disorder, the phoenixes soar a thousand flights yet remain ever paired. If humans fall short of birds, what claim to humanity remains?

Alas, how is it that the foolish masses, neglecting the bounds of ritual and propriety, repeatedly violate the precept against licentiousness? With rosy cheeks and raven locks, they entangle themselves in love’s snares, stealing jade and pilfering fragrance, their madness growing daily. Yet know this: all share the same heart, and thus the same principle; all share the same principle, and thus the same feelings. I urge those in the realm of desire: when tempted to seduce another’s wife or daughter, turn back and reflect deeply. Imagine if your own wife or daughter were enticed away, her pillowside whispers and tender embraces lavished upon another—if you stood by, witnessing such a scene, would your eyes not burn, your heart not seethe? Would you not clench your fists in rage, striking out without a moment’s hesitation?

Alas! All share the same feelings, and thus the same principle; all share the same principle, and thus the same heart. To defile one is to defile generations; to defile another is to defile oneself. The thought of lust must be swiftly eradicated. The retributions for licentiousness and the admonitions against it—ancient sages and former worthies have set forth countless examples. May those who turn back seek them out and study them.

**Reverence for Sun and Moon**

That Heaven and Earth possess sun and moon is like humans possessing two eyes.

The eye delights in purity and uprightness—all people are thus. Were someone to relieve themselves before your eyes, you would surely seethe with rage; were they to bathe before your eyes, you would surely flush with shame; were they to curse before your eyes, you would surely bristle with fury. Yet why, when the radiant sun and moon gaze down upon you, do you fail to show them reverence?

Only with the advent of sun and moon were yin and yang divided, day and night distinguished, and vision made clear. Thus, when the sun sinks in the west and daylight fades, those with eyes yet grope in darkness; when the moon sets in the west and the clear night darkens, those with eyes yet wander in blindness. How can one receive the illumination of sun and moon, borrow their luminous brilliance, yet remain ignorant of their supreme virtue?

Now I exhort you, people of the world: harbor awe and reverence, embody respect and veneration. Do not relieve yourselves before sun and moon, do not bathe before sun and moon, do not curse before sun and moon. Those who relieve themselves before sun and moon shall be pierced by the arrows of a hundred thousand wrathful spirits and suffer strange maladies; those who bathe before sun and moon shall have their bones pricked by a hundred thousand yin soldiers and contract chilling ailments; those who curse before sun and moon shall have their transgressions silently recorded by ten thousand investigating deities, who will then harass and oppress them, annihilating them utterly. Thus, sun and moon must be revered. People of the world, take heed and be warned!

**Exhortation to Repair Ancestral Graves**

A dwelling is the abode of the living, just as a grave is the home of the dead. When tiles leak and walls crumble, wind and rain assail, the living cannot rest in peace—how then can the dead find repose when earth collapses and coffins cave in, when ants burrow and worms bore through?

Now I exhort the people of the world: each tend to your ancestral graves. Those with means may undertake the task alone, and the blessings that follow shall be theirs to receive; those without resources may still contribute their strength, and the spirits’ repose shall bring them sheltering shade. Spare no expense, shirk no labor. Those whose families have long prospered must remember that today’s glory is but the legacy of their ancestors; those whose fortunes have newly risen must remember that today’s prosperity is but the fruit of their forebears’ labors—what merit is yours? What virtue have you established?

In life, they clothed and fed you—how can you ever repay their boundless kindness? In death, you honor them morning and night—how can you not cherish the ground where they rest? Tend to their graves generation after generation, and your descendants shall repay you in kind; repair them year after year, and the gods’ benevolent retribution shall grow ever more manifest. Those who disbelieve shall meet with early death, poverty, extinction, and lowly station; those who believe shall enjoy longevity, wealth, peace, health, and noble rank.

I have seen fine tombs fallen into desolation and known the descendants’ fortunes to wither in turn. When stone tablets lie beneath cold mist, how many clans have seen their heirs decline? When barren mounds bury rotting grass, how many families have seen their children fall into ruin? Who among us is without feeling? Who can escape this fate?

Here now is a matter of common sense—you ought to grasp its principle. Those who discourse on fengshui heap sand upon branches, for appearance’s sake alone they seek enclosure; those who repair tomb foundations build terraces and steps, for the earth’s veins must not be harmed. Even among ordinary folk, on the very day they inter their ancestors’ remains, they plant dense hedges on either side and diligently pile up earth and stone. How is it that what was so carefully tended in former days is suddenly abandoned by later generations?

I now instruct you all: let each person sweep and pay respects, adding good soil where needed; let every year’s visit include the uprooting of noxious trees. Thus the grave mound shall suffer no collapse or subsidence, and the qi of the veins shall rise and flourish; the fine tomb shall sprout lush grass, and the roots of trees shall settle firmly. With the ancestral spirits at peace, worthy descendants shall multiply. Should you defy this teaching, you shall surely incur divine punishment.

Looking up and down, sighing in sorrow, one feels the poignant beauty of a world cut off from its glory.

On Geomancy
The earth stands at the center of the Three Powers; to speak of geomancy is to speak of the resonance between heaven’s principle and man’s. When man seeks to assess the land, heaven likewise assesses man; when man seeks to choose the land, the land likewise chooses man. Though many in the world discuss the principles of land, do they also know the principles by which land is obtained?

The principles of discussing land are governed by man; the principles of obtaining land are governed by heaven, while the land itself conceals and reveals them. To know the difficulty of seeking land and thus abandon the search is wrong; yet to know the difficulty of seeking land and still forcefully pursue it is also impossible.

Master Ziping once said: “The teachings of geomancy did not originally arise for the sake of shielding descendants; rather, descendants use them to settle the ancestral spirits, and the ancestral spirits in turn bless the descendants—this is the Dao that runs through all.”

Now, land is of three ranks, and those who obtain land are likewise divided into three levels. The highest rank of land corresponds above to the stars, below to the map of the earth; it is formed by heaven and earth, its trigrams settled and stable, entirely the work of nature, with no human effort involved. Only sages, heroes, and those of great virtue and hidden merit can obtain such land.

The middle rank of land also possesses natural scenery, yet within it there are transformations: the eight trigrams interact, the five phases push and pull, a mass of true qi subtly swells and rises. Only those of steadfast loyalty and integrity, with some measure of virtue and hidden merit, can obtain such land.

The lowest rank of land presents itself in every mountain and stream, spread across the land—seen once every ten li, twice every hundred li, found everywhere, sought anywhere. Yet one must still understand the dragon’s origin, the mountain’s orientation, the soil’s color, skillfully selecting and arranging, aligning mountains and rivers with the luopan, not forcing the luopan to conform to mountains and rivers. Only when land and man are mutually suited is harmony achieved. This rank is attainable by any steadfast, loyal, and blameless person.

These are the great principles of the three ranks; those below them need not be discussed, for there is no auspicious land for the unvirtuous. How easily can one speak of the oxen-sleeping auspicious mounds!

Alas! Though man may be skilled in assessing land, heaven is also skilled in assessing man! Though man may be skilled in choosing land, the land is also skilled in choosing man! Can one not strive to be a virtuous person, so as to obtain ancient land?

I have seen many in the world seek land, and so I compose *On Geomancy* to awaken them.

In the city of Langzhong, Zhu Daosheng, styled Wancheng, and his nephew Ying Chunchen, along with Zhu Zan, styled Suyuan, collated and proofread the text. His sons Huang Panxi and Doumu Yuanjun, the Supreme Nine Sovereigns’ True Scripture, offer this incense hymn:

Within the celestial Dipper, within the heart’s Dipper,
To revere the Dipper is first to revere the heart,
To revere the heart is also to revere the Dipper.
The heart’s tally: seven returns seven,
The numbers align: nine returns nine.
Precious censer burns incense, taking refuge in the Dipper Mother.
Thrice bathed, thrice perfumed, bowing deeply in reverence.

With sincere heart, we pay homage to:
The Primordial Divine Empress, the Sage of Tianzhu.
She governs the celestial pivot, traversing India.
Dwelling in the highest realm, she establishes the Great Central Heaven.
She commands the myriad spirits, roaming the Three Realms.
Her elixir refined in the nine tripods, her Dao succors all beings.
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—
The Qi of Brahmā, the Primordial Divine Empress, the Peerless Heavenly Dipper Mother.

With sincere heart, we pay homage to:
The Perfected Transmitter of the Dao, the Immortal Chosen by the Great Clarity.
Residing on Wudang, she inaugurated the teaching,
The true lineage of Wen Shi.
Like one entranced, she concealed her immortal traces in the splendor of spring;
Teaching filial piety and loyalty, she spread the mystic breeze across China.
She delivered the thirteen thousand from the Eastern Sea,
Husband and wife ascending together;
She continued the divine efficacy of the Dragon and Tiger,
Her Dao and methods both complete.
The precious raft of the ten directions, the master of the Three Teachings—
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Mercy, Great Benevolence,
Most Profound, Most Wondrous, Most Marvelous, Most Divine—
The Eastern August Minister, the Outer Minister of the Three Pure Ones,
The Thunder Spirit Officer, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Master,
The Primordial Qi’s Founding Ancestor, the Dao-Pervading, Culture-Distant True Lord,
The Manifest and Transformative Heavenly Worthy.

With sincere heart, we pay homage to:
The Jade Clarity’s Inner Minister, the Immortal Chosen from the Golden Portal.
She manifested as the teacher of the Three Teachings,
Wielding the law and issuing the commands of the Five Thunders.
Awakening from the yellow millet dream, she forgot worldly fame and glory;
Her precious sword’s radiance severed the demons of the human realm.
For the four births and six destinies, she responds to all who call;
Across the Three Realms and ten directions, no request goes unanswered.
On Yellow Crane Tower, she left her wondrous traces;
In Purple Mushroom Grotto, she refined the numinous cinnabar.
She enshrined the sacred image on cloud-clad cliffs,
Revealed immortal traces in the jade firmament.
She spread the incense fire of the Dharma gate,
Providing the ladder and ferry for the mystic lineage—
Great Sage, Great Mercy, Great Benevolence, Great Filial Piety,
The Mountain-Opening, Teaching-Inaugurating, Mystic-Responsive Patriarch,
The Heavenly Thunder’s High Minister, the Numinous Treasure Perfected One,
The Pure Yang’s Manifestation of the Orthodox, the Awakening Transformation,
The Emperor Lord Who Protects and Assists, the Wondrous Dao’s Promulgator,
The Heavenly Worthy of Universal Salvation, the Perfectly Illumined, the Free and Unfettered,
The True Buddha of Culture and Wisdom.

**Mystic Essence Incantation of the Scripture’s Opening:**
The Qi’s womb is without limit,
Primordial before heaven and earth.
Embracing creation in empty profundity,
Reverently awaiting the divine luminaries.
The moon emits the white-rayed mark,
Clouds return to the vermilion gate.
The celestial river follows the turning of fortune,
The imperial carriage does not tarry.
Virtue harmonizes with the Three Origins’ principle,
Merit transmits the Nine Sons’ numinosity.
Majestic are the true parents,
Luxuriant is the ancient scripture’s text.
The supreme Dao encompasses the profound and wondrous,
The true person embodies utmost sincerity.
With devout heart, one may move and align,
For myriad ages, inscribing longevity.

**The Primordial Divine Empress, the Dipper Mother, the Supreme Dao’s Nine Sovereigns’ True Scripture**

At that time, the Primordial Dao Empress, the Dipper Mother, Supreme Sovereign, dwelled within the Dipper Pivot Palace of the Qi’s Brahmā Heaven, together with the Heavenly Dipper Father, the King Who Rules the Zhou. Together, they gazed down upon the world below, where there was a true person, surnamed Zhang, named Tong, with the Daoist name Kunyang, who was the incarnation of the Nine Sovereigns’ fifth, the Celestial Bird. He cultivated the Dao during the transition between the Northern Yuan and Southern Ming, dwelling on Mount Emei’s Fufuquan, reverently worshipping the Dipper and awaiting the imperial summons for ascension. The Dipper Mother, moved by his sincere heart, turned the jade pivot, and with a sudden sound, manifested her luminous and wondrous form. Riding a chariot drawn by seven boars, she descended into the true person’s Dipper-worshipping altar within the span of a single double-hour. She wove clouds of radiance and suspended a precious throne, whereupon she expounded this *Nine Sovereigns’ True Scripture*.

The true person bowed deeply, prostrating himself before the throne. Then the Dipper Mother addressed the true person, saying: “Rise, and I shall speak to you. I am Molizhitian, the Myriad Sunlit Vastness. Before the Heavenly Sovereign, I had already emerged; before the Earthly Sovereign, I dwelled in the Western Continent’s Tianzhu, wielding great divine efficacy and traversing India. Later, I saw the Zhou King of the Northern Continent, Yudan Yue, who was devoted to the stellar sacrifices, kind-hearted and fond of goodness. Thus, I went to assist him. Seeking pure land, I built walls and gates, holding the scriptures of the Wuji Palace, truly nurturing the golden womb’s chamber. A single mass of divine qi, thrice transcending, gave birth to nine sacred heirs. The eldest was Tianying, the Human Sovereign, who later ascended as the Jade Perfected Immortal; the second was Tianren, the third Tianzhu, the fourth Tianxin, the fifth Tianqin, the sixth Tianfu, the seventh Tianchong, the eighth Tianrui, and the ninth Tianpeng—jewel forests and jade blossoms, towering and resplendent. These are the Nine Sons, their royal title the Nine Sovereigns. The Human Sovereign and his brothers divided and ruled the nine provinces, known as the Fang Clan, their benevolent influence vast and far-reaching, universally benefiting all beings. The Nine Sovereigns ascended, mother and sons dwelling together. The Primordial Beginning named me the Primordial Dao Empress, commending my virtue of nurturing the Nine Sovereigns. The Great Equalizer is in my grasp, and I hold the Dipper’s pivot. The Nine Sovereigns ascend to illuminate the nine stars, and the nine stars encircle the single enclosure. Relying on the wondrousness of the single qi, I further transformed the Seven Primordials. The Nine Celestial Bodies may descend into the world, while the Seven Primordials alternate in their revolutions.”

The Dipper Mother said: “If in the world there are those who cultivate virtue and practice the Dao, who reverently inquire about the Nine Sovereigns’ governance and the Seven Primordials’ alternation, simply expound to them the Northern Dipper’s arrayed stars, and all they govern may be known. The Dipper is the celestial chariot, revolving at the center, overseeing the eight directions, harmonizing yin and yang. It establishes the four seasons, harmonizes the five phases, determines the various records, shifts the nodal measures—all depend upon the Dipper. The first is Tian Shu, governing yang virtue; the second is Tian Xuan, governing yin punishment; the third is Tian Ji, governing fortune and goodness; the fourth is Tian Quan, governing misfortune and evil; the fifth is Yu Heng, governing life and death; the sixth is Kai Yang, governing the hundred grains; the seventh is Yao Guang, governing the six armies. The eighth, to the left of Kai Yang, is named the Auxiliary Star; the ninth, to the right of Yao Guang, is named the Minister Star—both assist the Dipper in accomplishing its work.”

Thus, the titles of the Nine August Stellar Lords of the Great Sage Northern Dipper are proclaimed:

First, the Yang Virtue Star Lord Cānláng of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Second, the Yin Punishment Star Lord Jùmén of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Third, the Fortune-and-Goodness Star Lord Lùcún of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Fourth, the Evil-Eradicating Star Lord Wénqǔ of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Fifth, the Life-and-Death Star Lord Liánzhēn of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Sixth, the Grain-Nurturing Star Lord Wǔqǔ of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Seventh, the Armies-Commanding Star Lord Pòjūn of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Eighth, the Left Auxiliary Star Lord Dòngmíng of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones;
Ninth, the Right Minister Star Lord Yǐnguāng of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones.

Such are the names and titles of these Stellar Lords, resplendent in celestial patterns. They hold the registers of life’s extension and death’s inscription, wielding authority over fortune, goodness, misfortune, and excess. Emperors and feudal lords, high ministers and common folk—all living beings belong to the Dipper’s palace.

Should any good man or good woman, afflicted by old age or illness, endure manifold sufferings, but repent their transgressions to dissolve faults, sincerely pay homage to the Dipper, recite these teachings of the Great Dao, and kindle the Nine August Divine Lamps to illuminate their life’s palace, they shall naturally turn misfortune into fortune, transform emolument into auspiciousness. The efficacies thereof are beyond full recounting.

The Dipper Mother declares: “The revolutions of the Northern Dipper depend upon the Seven Primes’ cycles of return. Its body is the Qian within Kun, its nature is firmness within softness. The Dao unfolds in the subtlety within subtlety, its qi derives from the yang within yang. At the end of the Qin, it manifested in the Western Han, appearing in person to expound the Dharma, converting the High Emperor.

Should any devotee seeking blessings wish to behold the august forms of the Seven Prime Golden Immortals, they must first sweep away worldly thoughts, purify the mind’s source, bow in reverence, and meditate with closed eyes. As celestial music floats in the void, the golden countenance shall appear of itself, the golden body shall reveal itself spontaneously—resembling the goddess Māgū, resembling the Lady of the Upper Prime. With the heroic qi of a woman, she compassionately delivers all beings. When the Seven Prime Lords ascend and descend in the central courtyard, all evil spirits retreat in haste, and a hundred blessings arrive in close succession.”

Thereupon, the *Incantation of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes for Resolving Calamities and Manifesting Efficacy* is proclaimed:

The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of one’s person;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the two illnesses;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the three corpses;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the four slaughters;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the five thieves;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the six excesses;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the seven injuries;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the eight difficulties;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the nine perversities;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Prime Lords resolve the calamity of the ten demons.

August are the Seven Prime Lords! Blessings extend to the faithful and good.
All illnesses they resolve; impermanence dares not encroach.

Divine in healing sickness, responsive as echoes through the valley;
To behold the radiant image, burn incense and await the moon’s rising.

The Dipper Mother declares: “The Seven Primes cycle and return; again we await the Nine August Ones’ homecoming.
Those who reverence the Seven Primes may be enabled to repel death and prolong life;
Those who reverence the Nine August Ones may further attain immortality and Buddhahood.
Should there be virtuous men and women who first pay homage to the Seven Prime Lofty Perfected, then to the Nine August Great Sages,
their dwellings and abodes shall surely know sweet dew descending and nectarous springs arising—
scoop and drink thereof, and they shall return to youth from old age, golden light enveloping their bodies.
Again, before the altar of the Nine August Ones, a full cycle of offerings made, nine years of practice upheld,
merit perfected and conduct fulfilled, they shall mount the crane and ascend into the void.
Such are the blessed rewards of revering the Dipper.”

Thereupon, the *Incantation of the Northern Dipper’s Nine August Ones’ Efficacy* is proclaimed:

The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve all calamities;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Two Luminaries;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Three Disasters;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Four Conditions;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Five Aggregates;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Six Dusts;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Seven Slaughters;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Eight Winds;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Nine Dark Realms;
The Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Nine August Lords resolve the calamity of the Ten Entanglements.

August are the Nine August Lords! Their grace illumines the nine regions.
Bodies free of obstacles and misfortune, forms neither born nor extinguished,
They come and go diligently to deliver the world, traversing heaven and earth in spring’s universal bloom.
The Dao’s methods know no bounds; auspicious clouds shelter the Perfected Ones on high.

The Dipper Mother further addressed the Perfected One, saying:
“The Seven Primes and Nine August Lords all arise from the continuity of my primordial qi. In the movement and stillness of this single qi, the alternation of yin and yang, the waxing and waning of the moon, the succession of day and night, dawn and dusk—all take their lead from it. In the transformative power of this single qi, the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams, the numerology of the River Chart and Luo Writing, the Changes—all are encompassed within it. Years, months, days, and hours; Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches; east, west, south, and north; mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks; birth from egg, womb, moisture, or transformation—none exist apart from the presence of this single qi. Vast, it embraces all; subtle, it penetrates all. Those who trust in it live; those who turn from it die. Those who follow it flourish; those who defy it perish. The great multitudes of the Three Teachings should all know this.

You were originally the Fifth Celestial Creature of the Nine August Lords, descended to the world below. Do not rely on past causes alone, but act in the present. If you cultivate now, past causes may be renewed. When the work of seven nines is complete, you will approach the sacred realm. Thus, I expound this scripture, entitled *The Primordial Qi Nine August Lords Perfected Scripture*. What I speak, you shall transmit—this is most intimate and direct.

Wherever this scripture resides, ten thousand spirits guard it, a thousand sages praise it, the Three Primes are outlined within it, and a single qi connects all. Those who study this scripture diligently will transcend life and death; those who study it diligently will comprehend the profound causes. Treasure and transmit it, but do not show it to the unworthy.”

As the Dipper Mother neared the end of her discourse, the celestial immortals and stellar hosts came to welcome her, returning to the Dipper Palace. Thereupon, the Perfected One, having received the wondrous Dharma, addressed the Dipper Mother, saying: “I now vow to propagate it widely, transmitting it to the virtuous. If there are men or women who receive, uphold, and recite it, I, together with the immortals and officials of the Dipper, shall protect them wherever they may be.”

Then, bowing again to the Dipper Mother, he offered this eulogy:

Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
One’s natal star descends with true numen.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
Parents are preserved in long life.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
The seven ancestors all ascend in transcendence.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
The nine lineages of descendants also attain perfection.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
All malevolent forces dissolve into dust.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
The ten thousand deviations naturally return to rectitude.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
All evils forever vanish and clear.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
The ten clans spontaneously flourish in glory.
Where the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* resides,
One perpetually safeguards harmony, benefit, and integrity.

The Dipper Mother said: “Excellent, excellent! You may propagate the true teaching; its merit is boundless. Guide and lead later generations to cultivate together the fruits of the Dao.”

The Perfected One bowed his head in reverence, giving thanks, and received the teaching with faith, vowing to uphold and practice it.

The Primordial Divine Dipper Mother, Supreme Dao of the Nine Sovereign Perfected Ones

The Primordial Pure Yang Lord, the Protector Emperor, said: “Formerly, I expounded the *Chapter on Gazing at the Stars and Revering the Dipper* to the Three Great Assemblies of Han San, for the transmitted Dipper rituals of the world consist only of rites of veneration, lacking esoteric secrets. Now, beholding the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* spoken by the Supreme Dipper Mother and the Perfected Lord of Kunyang, which unifies the great Dao of the Three Origins and illumines the numinous communion of the single qi, it is fully commensurate with the *Five Dipper Scriptures of the Most High*, preceding and following in equal measure. Superior practitioners who cultivate it will surely transcend the mundane and enter sagehood; middling practitioners who awaken to it will also perceive their nature and illumine their minds.”

May all beings across the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds, through a hundred generations and ten thousand ages, take refuge and revere this teaching—boundless shall be their merit and virtue.

Now, for those who perform the Dipper rites, I shall set forth the procedures in clear order. All who practice the *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* must first purify their ritual chamber, still their breath, and sever worldly attachments. Facing north, they bow in reverence, stand with hands clasped in auspicious reverence, as though the Celestial Countenance of the Dipper Mother has descended above, and as though a thousand perfected ones and ten thousand sages encircle them. Only then do they perform the Dipper veneration with utmost sincerity.

The body must be poised, the heart upright, the spirit settled, the mind discerning, the qi harmonious, and the voice even. Ascents and descents follow proper measure, advances and retreats observe refined form, movements and pauses adhere to ritual, and rises and prostrations maintain due proportion. First, they pay homage to the august titles; next, they recite the true scripture. Upon completing the recitation and rites, they then chant the two Dipper incantations.

Though I am not wise, I have privately examined the *Daoist Canon* and the *Buddhist Canon* and learned that the Sanskrit names of the Dipper Mother number over several dozen—too many for practitioners to recite in full. Here, I shall select the most concise and efficacious from the canon’s records and proclaim them for all virtuous adepts.

The *Dipper Mother’s Heart Mantra* states:

"Namo ratna-trayāya, tara yathā, tadyathā: akāṣa-maṣi, makā-maṣi, adū-maṣi, pūrvapāla-maṣi, mahā-pūrvapāla-maṣi, adanta, namo maṣi-māli, pūrya-maṣi. Namo suddhe, ra kṣa, ra kṣa svāhā, svā-satva-nandā svāhā, svā-tāra svāhā, svā-supūrṇa, vi-viyākṣa svāhā. Namo samanta, mudana, oṃ māli-je svāhā."

*Phonetic rendering:*
Namo laidan-na, dola-ye-ye, dani-yetuo, ajia-moxi, mojia-moxi, adu-moxi, bupolai-moxi, moha-bupolai-moxi. Adantuona, namoxi-moli, buyemo-xi, namo suidudi, laiqicha, laiqicha-mousa, wasadan-walanzuosuo, wadanlaisa, wasazibunala, feipiyao-sawaha. Namo sanmanda, muduonan, anmali-ji, mangsuohe.

Again, proclaim the *Northern Dipper Heart Mantra*:
"Oṃ, na, xī-xī-na, luó-luó-na, jié-dá-na, jié-na, na, na, oṃ, hūṃ, hūṃ, hūṃ, zhī-dì, shē-sū-zhà, ā-ruò-mì-zhà, wū-dū-zhà, shì-zhà, bō-tí-zhà, wēi-ruò-zhà, jù-luó-tí-zhà, shì-mó-zhà, sà svāhā."

*Phonetic rendering:*
Oṃ, goudina, jiji-na, luolou-na, xida-na, zhixi-na, batou-na, baye-na, oṃ, hūṃ, hūṃ, hūṃ-niàn-he, jùzhī-dì, shē-sū-zhā, ā-rě-mì-zhā, wū-dū-zhà, jù-qí-zhā, bō-lài-dì-zhā, yē-wēi-rě-zhā, jù-luó-dì-zhā, qí-mó-zhā, sà-pó-hē.

After the Pure Yang Imperial Lord proclaimed the Dipper incantations, the Perfected One bowed a hundred times and kowtowed, then offered this unifying eulogy:

"Atop Fortune Spring Peak, in the third watch of an autumn moon,
The vast sky stretches, deep blue, immaculate and dustless.
The Heavenly Mother’s compassionate heart
Responds and descends to the mountain pavilion.
Before the Dharma-expounding terrace, immortal blossoms gleam bright and fragrant—
In a flash, the moment arrives even now.
The Protector Imperial Lord
Recites the incantation to supplement the true scripture.
With great compassion and great vows,
The Heavenly Mother, too, rejoices."

To the Primordial Divine Marshal, Marīci Bodhisattva, Dipper Mother, Supreme Primordial Honored One—ninefold homage.
May this merit
Pervade all beings without exception.
Having now received and upheld it,
May its radiance be transmitted through ten thousand kalpas.

The *Three Sacred and Wondrous True Scriptures of the Former Three Teachings*—their three divisions—are penned in imitation of the *Huangting*. Their words fundamentally exhort one to revere the divine and sagely with utmost devotion, yet within them the Dao of the Golden Elixir is also fully contained. Both their form and meaning may be reverently upheld. Though I dared not presume to add even a single word of praise, having received them directly from my master’s hand and been commanded to annotate them forthwith, I withdrew and composed these notes.

**Preface to the Exegesis:**
*Former* refers to that which precedes the Great Ultimate. *Three Teachings* denotes the transmissions of *establishing life*, *completing life*, and *returning to life*. *Supreme Sages* is a metaphor for the highest-grade Golden Elixir. *Spiritual* compares to the primordial Yuan Spirit, most subtle and unfathomable. *Wondrous* encompasses the youngest maiden of the Dui trigram, who receives the yang radiance of the Zhen trigram’s youth. *True Scripture* is none other than true lead. Formerly, the Shangyang Perfected One annotated the *Most Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Lord for the Salvation of All*, and composed a prefatory verse:

*"The Supreme Lord’s auspicious abode lies before the Great Ultimate,
Even prior to the time before parents gave birth.
To save others is to save oneself—this true scripture saves,
And if you ask what the true scripture is, it is gui, which is lead."*

I, too, offer this same verse for this preface.

**Eulogy to the Opening of the Scripture by the Protector Imperial Lord:**
The primordial ancestral qi,
Silent, profound.
The zither plucks Dharma tones,
The flute plays immortal melodies—
Incense and blossoms fill the chamber like a jade grove.
Within the inner sanctum, deep and still,
The three supreme honored ones descend in their sacred presence.

The primordial ancestral qi is the great medicine.
*Silent, profound* describes the time before division.
The *zither* symbolizes the attainment of harmony.
The *flute* symbolizes regulated breathing, and also the void.
The line on *incense and blossoms* compares to lead blossoms emerging from the crucible.
The final two lines truly indicate a state utterly unstained, where utmost sincerity moves the divine.

A single gatha reveals the essence of the entire scripture.

At that time, the Cavernous Mystery’s Perfected Immortal Zhang,
With a dragon-coiling brush, expounded the true scripture.
The scripture declares: The three teachings’ ancient sages,
Whose Dao towers above ten thousand generations, receive luminous offerings.

In the Eastern Zhou, the Unadorned King was born on Mount Ni—
On the full moon of winter’s month, in Changping,
When the Zhou calendar fixed the first month at *zi*,
Winter’s month belonging to *xu*—now corresponding to the fifteenth day of the ninth month.

In the West, the body of Siddhārtha Gautama—
On the eighth day of the fourth month, in the city of Wei,
When the Shang king fixed the first month at *chou*,
The fourth month belonging to *chen*—now corresponding to the eighth day of the third month.

The Supreme Lord of the ten directions and three realms—
On the fifteenth day of the second month, descending in Chengling,
When the Shang king fixed the first month at *chou*,
The second month belonging to *yin*—now corresponding to the fifteenth day of the first month.

For thousands and hundreds of kalpas, the great potter’s wheel turns,
And primordial qi abounds, casting forth sagely heroes.
In heaven above and earth below, these three honored ones,
Through boundless kalpas, are known to all.

At that time—*er shi*—"that" being the counterpart to "this," and "time" the moment when yang arises. The Great Dao of Former Heaven all emerges from this very moment, which is why true scriptures often begin with these words.

The Patriarch expounded the *Dongming Jing*, ranking it among the "Caverns and Mysteries." *Dong* means "pervading all without obstruction," and *xuan* means "penetrating its subtleties." Now he expounds this *Lingmiao Zhenjing*, which encompasses the Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar. The *qiu* belongs to yin, the dragon to yang; when yin and yang converge beneath the brush, the Great Dao issues forth from the true scripture.

The scripture states that after the ancient sages emerged into the world and attained the Dao, they received offerings of bright sacrifice for ten thousand generations, exhorting later disciples to reverently bow before the sages and earnestly seek the Golden Elixir. Yet these three supreme sages were born on different days, which suggests that the medicine of Former Heaven and the *huozi* hour cannot be rigidly fixed.

The sages must wait for the great potter’s wheel to turn for thousands and hundreds of kalpas, until primordial *qi* is abundant, before their numinous spirits are nurtured—just as in the way of the Golden Elixir, one must surpass five thousand forty-eight days before the golden *qi* is full and the watery tide arises.

Above heaven and earth, only these three sages are most revered; within the body, only golden lead is most precious. Through boundless kalpas, their names are known to all, and after attaining the Elixir, one endures through eons without decay.

Now I expound these three sacred scriptures—water has its depths, trees have their roots. May people embody the grace of these three sages, and on their birthdays, express sincere devotion. No need for ritual vessels as in the court, no need for repentance assemblies with resounding conches. Only maintain fasting and solemnity, straighten your cap and sash, sweep the pure chamber clean of the slightest dust. In the empty, silent room, light a silver lamp; incense smoke spirals in a single wisp of clarity. Water, fruit, and tea flowers—pure and fragrant—bow humbly in reverence, awaiting the cloud chariot.

May the Primordial be preserved in its harmony and uprightness; may greed, delusion, desire, and anger be severed. May the five thousand characters of the *Daode* be studied; may the three teachings be practiced to wander in eternal spring. With a single thought of true inquiry, the mind is not scattered, and great blessings descend without delay.

The three sages govern the myriad spirits of the ten thousand scriptures—who can obstruct the bestowal of fortune and longevity upon me? The Patriarch, in reverence for the sages, expounds the true scriptures; thus, to honor the true scriptures is to honor the sages themselves.

The primordial unity of *qi* emerges from emptiness and nothingness, seemingly unfathomable in its source. Yet who knows that yang is born within *gui*, truly like water having its source and trees their roots? May people bear in mind the grace of this origin. When the true unity of *qi* arrives, they must express sincere devotion to welcome it, just as when encountering the sages’ birthdays.

The *Cantong Qi* says: *"With utmost sincerity and focused density, carefully await the celestial signs."* The noble person values this Dao, leaving ritual vessels and repentance assemblies to the keepers of such affairs—monks and Daoists. I only purify my heart, solemnize my spirit, enter the chamber, approach the furnace, straighten my cap and sash, and wait.

Take the Yellow Chamber as the pure abode, the Mysterious Pass as the empty room; sweep away every speck of dust, empty all thoughts. Golden and silver light appears, as if bright lamps. The silver lamp is a metaphor for the lead cauldron; a single wisp of clear incense is the first stirring of yang *qi*. Water, fruit, and tea flowers are metaphors for the medicinal substances of the Buddhist tradition.

At that time, the water’s source is utterly pure, the jade bud just blossoming—how could it not be pure and fragrant? The *Cantong Qi* says: *"The true person is most subtle, as if present, as if absent."* At that time, one must bow humbly, listen attentively, and watch closely; only then will the cloud chariot of the true person arrive. Await the true person as one awaits the sages.

*Ganyuan hengli zhen*—like the gathering of the five phases. Greed, delusion, desire, and anger must be utterly untethered. The five thousand words of the *Daode* expound this true and constant Dao. Weighing the teachings of the three traditions, one may then employ their great efficacy. Attaining it in an instant, one eternally preserves eternal spring—hence, *"a single thought of true inquiry, and great blessings descend."* "Without delay" means the Yang Elixir is formed in a moment.

The three families gather in the Central Palace, and the myriad spirits all heed their command—thus, *"governing the ten thousand scriptures."* Fortune and longevity depend entirely on the spirit of awareness within the primordial body—who dares obstruct it?

If you regard the true scripture as true gold, it surpasses worldly lead and silver. With utmost sincerity and focused density, cherish this rare treasure, and your household will surely not remain impoverished. It moistens the body and the house, enriching metal and wood; dwelling in peace and ease, joy knows no bounds. Not only does it reduce illness and prolong life, but it also establishes destiny and completes the horn.

In darkness, the black register of the netherworld is erased; in one’s steps, auspicious omens arise like mist. Before you, the great gate of destiny unfolds; after death, worthy jade-like descendants are nurtured. Accumulating merit and virtue harmonizes neighbors; virtue spreads through the village, transforming it into benevolence.

After a hundred years, the cicada sheds its shell to return to the Jade Capital; crimson clouds escort one to ascend the Heavenly Gate. The true scripture is true gold—the Patriarch here makes this clear. True gold is the treasure of long life; how can it be compared to common lead or silver?

Only with utmost sincerity and focused density, treasuring it as a rare jewel, will true gold return to the dwelling, filling the hall with yellow and white. How could one then lament poverty? Moistening the house and body, dwelling in peace and ease—all describe the coagulation of the Elixir’s head, the true *qi* embraced within.

Once the Yang Elixir is attained, it is not merely like refining the self and laying the foundation, merely reducing illness and prolonging life. It directly establishes destiny and completes the horn, ensuring long life and enduring vision. At that time, one’s name is inscribed in the immortal ranks, and the black register is erased—*"the dust of sin and the world is wiped away in a single stroke."*

In one’s steps, all is serene and tranquil; the great gate of destiny unfolds. The Elixir Furnace becomes the abode of immortals. Then, with the mother *qi* of the Yang Elixir subduing and the child *qi* of the Yin Elixir refined into the ninefold return of golden liquid, and further with the transmutation of the cauldron and the separation of the embryo, each golden brother and jade sibling will ride the crane.

Thus, concealing or revealing oneself among mortals, one accumulates merit and piles up virtuous deeds, first delivering oneself and then delivering others. When the celestial mandate arrives, one ascends in broad daylight—crimson clouds will gather in escort, and the gates of heaven open. Those of superior root and Dao-instrument must embody the scriptural principles and put them into practice to attain this. Do not suppose that merely reciting them with the mouth for a lifetime can lead to immortality.

Never meet a sacred birth with indifference, nor vent anger and spew harsh words. Indulgence in lust and licentiousness within the chamber will invite the celestial spirits to investigate and strip away what remains. In ordinary times, reverence for the sacred must be utmost and sincere; at this moment, one should be even more deeply cautious. If at this instant there is no inclination to prostrate in devotion, one may infer the habitual state of the heart.

When encountering a sacred birth, one must pay the utmost attention. At the time when Yang is born, one must concentrate the mind. If one still harbors anger, vents malice, or clings to lust for sensual pleasures, true *qi* will inevitably scatter. Not only does this harm oneself, but the celestial spirits, in their scrutiny, will also deprive one of years of life.

Awaiting the moment to refine the self requires utmost sincerity. When entering the chamber and approaching the Elixir Furnace, one must be even more deeply cautious. If one lacks solemn reverence in seeking Lead, then in ordinary refinement of the self, one may also infer a lack of purity.

This passage repeatedly admonishes, its meaning crystal clear. I wish for all to reverently uphold and follow it, purifying the heart and cleansing the mind until the solitary resolve is pure. Though unseen and unheard, the Three Sages ride the crimson clouds in solemn presence. The majestic demeanor of Confucius shines like the rising sun; the dharma-form of Śākyamuni is round like the autumn moon. The purple *qi* of the Pass streams forth in profusion, inspiring awe and vigilance in those who behold it. Gazing up at the lofty mountain with ever-deepening reverence, scholars and commoners alike are no longer of the mundane world.

Those who revere the sacred must express utmost devotion. Those who seek Lead must maintain profound stillness, purify the heart, cleanse the mind, and unify the resolve to observe its return. Purity and impurity stand in opposition; only with pure sincerity in seeking the Elixir can one succeed. Generally, when *qi* is settled and spirit is concentrated, purity arises; when emotions prevail, impurity follows. Seeking Lead in accordance with the proper timing is purity; acting recklessly out of season is impurity.

Moreover, the *qi* of prior heaven is deep and silent, without sound or shadow, unseen and unheard. Only by humbly restraining one’s seeing and hearing can one come to perceive and hear as if truly present. Beholding the sages riding the clouds is like witnessing the true person emerging from the cauldron. What the master calls *"a single red flower"* is the utmost truth.

Like the rising sun—newly manifested Yang light, the evening of the third day. Like the autumn moon—abundant Metal and Water, the night of the fifteenth. Like the purple *qi*—true *qi* surging, the fire of the Mysterious Pass igniting.

The Elixir school speaks of the third day and also of the fifteenth: the third symbolizes the newness of the *qi* of Metal and Water, the fifteenth its fullness. If the *qi* is insufficient, Water will not be born. The third and fifteenth must be viewed as one continuous moment, conceived as a single strand—one cannot calculate them by counting numbers. If one calculates by numbers, how can it be called the living *zi* hour?

Within the third is contained the fifteenth. On the third, the medicine is two parts tender; on the fifteenth, the Yang *qi* is pure and complete. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *"The three and five unite in harmony with the ninefold nodes."* At this time, when the fire is applied, there appears the image of purple *qi* entering the Pass. Otherwise, if even a moment is delayed, it falls into posterior heaven, and the Yang Elixir will be difficult to complete. Therefore, one must gaze vigilantly, never missing the moment of interaction.

Gazing up at the lofty mountain is what is meant by *"the mountain of form faces and welcomes the true person."* Those of the Elixir school who understand this, though they be scholars or commoners, transcend the mundane. The mechanism of entering sagehood lies in this single decisive effort—how can one not take this matter seriously?

The master’s oral instructions are fully revealed here for the benefit of fellow seekers.

In the Central Heaven, a rain of flowers pervades the cosmos; before the Dharma-throne, the atmosphere is renewed. Mountains, rivers, and the great earth radiate light; in the Lotus Society, flowers bloom in a spring of white snow. The Celestial Emperor, moved by compassion, expounds the true scripture and dispatches divine attendants to guard the *bing*-*ding*. On this day and night, the moon emerges in the *geng* direction; its clear radiance shines upon the empty and perilous stars. From the azure vault, the faint sound of flutes and reed pipes is heard; the incense-bearing devotee gazes into the void in welcome.

The scripture is honored as the host, the self as the guest. From this point on, through cultivation, one resolves inauspicious influences. The Central Heaven is likened to the realm of emptiness and nothingness. The rain of flowers symbolizes the birth of Metal and Water. The wondrous union of emptiness and nothingness with heaven and earth—within it lies the cauldron and furnace, the celestial stars and earthly tides, just as they pervade the cosmos.

The Dharma-throne is the place of Elixir refinement. What is the atmosphere before the throne? The *Niwan* says: *"Mountains, rivers, and the great earth burst into fierce fire."* Zhang Guo says: *"Upon opening the furnace, one already perceives the radiance."* Such is the atmosphere before the throne. The lotus society’s flowers bloom in a spring of white snow—the Lead flower appears as white as snowflakes.

The Celestial Emperor symbolizes the lord of the heart. Loving true gold, one employs the fire of spirit to refine it. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"Further relying on Ding Gong’s forging."* On this day and evening, precisely when the moon emerges in the *geng* direction, though it marks the time of expounding the scripture, it also signifies the time of seeking gold. The clear light shines forth, illuminating the cavern of the empty and perilous stars; the flutes and reed pipes of the azure vault resemble the scene of Mercury welcoming Lead in joyous union. The incense-bearing devotee is none other than the cultivator of the Elixir. I visit their home, yet they become the host and I the guest—host and guest float and sink, self and other are inverted. This is the wondrous method of seeking the Elixir.

From this point on, through cultivation, one obtains the Elixir and enters the cauldron, where Yin diminishes and Yang flourishes, resolving inauspicious influences.

When heaven and earth are not in harmony, recite the true scripture, and wind, thunder, rain, and clearing will arrive in due season. When the solar terms are not in harmony, recite the true scripture, and spring, autumn, winter, and summer will be properly aligned. When the nation is not at peace, recite the true scripture, and the four directions will rejoice in prosperity. When the people and creatures are not at ease, recite the true scripture, and the mountains, corners, and watery marshes will all be joyful. When the nine dark realms and nine hells hear the true scripture, stagnant souls and departed spirits may be delivered.

In renowned mountains and sacred cloisters, the true scripture is concealed,
To guide Daoist adepts and lead eminent monks.

*Recitation* refers to cultivation.
Heaven and earth are likened to the body.
When the body’s movements are erratic,
Storms rage, winds howl, Kan and Li flee in chaos,
Thunder crashes, dew chills—men and women grow frantic.
To ensure the harmonious unfolding of wind, thunder, rain, and dew,
One must diligently cultivate the true scripture.

The *solar terms* denote the four seasons.
When the governance of the four seasons falters,
Spring’s *mao* and autumn’s *you* deviate from their baths,
Winter’s heat and summer’s frost invert Yin and Yang.
To align spring, summer, autumn, and winter in proper order,
One must diligently cultivate the true scripture.

The *nation* is likened to the foundation of the Elixir.
When the true scripture ensures safety,
The four directions—east, south, west, and north—rejoice together.
*People and creatures* also mirror the foundation of the Elixir.
When the true scripture brings tranquility,
Mountains, corners, and watery marshes all exult.
As for the dark realms and departed spirits—all Yin and perverse—
The true scripture causes Yin to retreat.

In mountain cloisters, where Daoists and monks embody half of Yang,
The true scripture enables them to attain full Yang.
The wondrous essence of the true scripture unfolds layer by layer,
And its foremost importance lies in the sacred birth.
Even a fleeting moment of faith brings glory—
How much more so if one preserves it to ascend the highest vehicle?
A thousand auspicious signs defy full enumeration,
Yet to fathom the jade casket is to draw near Penglai’s isles.

Solemnly expounded, the *Scripture of Numinous Wonders*,
By the Master of Cavernous Mystery, the Heavenly Master’s descendant.
Layer upon layer of wondrous essence,
Here synthesized from prior metaphors to conclude.
People, creatures, nations, solar terms, and heaven and earth—
All encompass the stages of laying the foundation, refining the self,
Gathering the medicine, and harmonizing the Elixir.
Yet this true scripture centers solely on the great matter of the Golden Elixir,
Thus it begins with the sacred birth, likening it to the primordial generation of the Golden Elixir.
By capturing the true Yin and true Yang—eightfold and of the same kind—
In a single moment, refining them into a single Yang Elixir,
Its transformation occurs in an instant.
If one can trust and embrace it even for a fleeting moment,
That moment will shine with brilliance.
How much more so if one preserves it without loss,
Combining the Yang Elixir with the Yin Elixir
To refine the ninefold return of golden liquid—
Would this not be ascending the highest vehicle?
Once the nine returns are accomplished, a thousand auspicious signs gather.
If one penetrates the jade casket’s depths,
The Isles of Penglai lie not far away.

Who but the Master of Cavernous Mystery could expound this scripture,
Revealing its numinous wonders?
And who is this Master?
The Heavenly Master’s descendant, Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng.
Only a true master can discourse on the true Dao—
How could this be lightly spoken?

Within the *True Scripture of the Three Teachings’ Great Sage, Numinous Response*,
The metaphor speaks of the work of external alchemy returning to internal nature,
Gold merging with essence.
The *Three Teachings* symbolize the paths of nurturing, perceiving, and restoring nature,
Unified in meaning with the prior three teachings.
The *Great Sage* signifies the great return.
*Numinous* refers to the single grain of the numinous Elixir.
*Response* signifies inner and outer resonance.
The *true scripture* is the golden liquid.

**Hymn of Opening the Scripture by Lord Fuyou**
Nectar pours upon the crown, rich and fragrant.
The dharma platform swept clean, flower rains fill the sky,
White clouds part to reveal the clear peaks.
A gentle breeze pervades the courtyard,
From afar, the three sacred visages appear.
The opening verse already reveals this scripture’s theme:
The great return of golden liquid—no further annotation is needed.

The Cavernous Mystery Perfected One, Immortal Zhang,
Transmitted the *Scripture of Numinous Response* beneath the azure heavens.
The Dao has three sages, centered in their positions,
First initiating, then following—teachings flourish in resonance.
One sage in Zouyi, east of Yanzhou,
One on Potala’s peak, where the tide’s sound falls,
One as Lord Guan, who inaugurated the mystic wind—
The Dao spread through China and the barbarian lands.

The three central sages descended from the celestial palace,
Their grace vast and flowing like a boundless tide.
Gathering righteousness to invigorate the spirit,
Who could mold such utter greatness and firmness?
Responding to cries with boundless compassion,
Saving the suffering, reviving the dust-veiled.
Master Wen Shi moves like a soaring dragon,
Leading the host of immortals in transformative work.

The three sages’ numinous radiance, infused with celestial qi,
Stems from years of learning and cultivation.
The great man upholds lofty aspirations, refining the Confucian demeanor,
Dwelling in benevolence, acting by righteousness—transcending the multitude.
Guanyin, embracing solitary devotion,
Endured ten trials and nine ordeals to attain perfect enlightenment.
On Stone Tower Mountain, wreathed in clouds and mist,
Through bitter resolve and diligent refinement, the Elixir glowed crimson.
Ascending with the entire household, soaring straight upward—
To this day, the bright moon illuminates the pine-clad vines.

The *Scripture of Numinous Response*, passed down by the ancestral master beneath the azure heavens,
Is no different from the descent of sweet dew.
Though the three sages differ, they share the same path of restoring nature,
The same principle of guarding the center—thus all occupy the central position.
The first three sages initiated, the latter three followed—
Like the Golden Elixir arising first, the golden liquid following after.
As the *Triplex Unity* states:
*“Suddenly attaining the golden blossom, it transforms in succession.
Turning into white liquid, it congeals into utmost firmness.”*
And again:
*“The golden blossom first initiates, then dissolves into water.”*
The golden blossom is merely the primordial qi.
At this stage of practice, the resonance of teachings grows ever more resplendent.

When the first three sages emerged, their paths diverged,
Yet all embodied the essence of pure gold, infused with celestial brilliance,
Descending from the celestial palace to bless the world.
This mirrors the Golden Elixir entering the cauldron,
After uniting with the pure, crossing the Magpie Bridge,
Ascending Kunlun, then transforming into a cup of nectar,
Pouring upon the crown gate, descending the Magpie Bridge,
Returning to the yellow chamber to coalesce into the numinous Elixir.
Vast and flowing—truly the form of the wondrous liquid.
This Elixir, born of gathered righteousness (righteousness being metal),
Is utterly great and firm—heaven and earth cannot mold it.
It responds to cries, arriving like the return;
Saving the suffering, sweet dew showers the dust-veiled.
One day, breaking through the crown to emerge,
Agile as a soaring dragon, one may partake in the work of transformation.
Such numinous radiance arises solely from cultivation and nurturance.

The aspiration of the Second Sage, the Dao-refining of the Mercy Boat, and the Elixir-cultivation of Stone Tower—all are one with this. May all in the world uphold reverence, gazing upon merit and virtue as upon towering Mount Song. When the birthdays of the Three Sages coincide, tea’s fragrance fills the air and water-flowers bloom thickly. Silently reciting the true scripture, the breast is cleansed, as if bathed in sacred grace and beholding the true countenance. Solemnly entering the temple to harmonize the sheng and yong, solemnly entering the monastery to attune the drum and bell. Upon the pond, turtles rise to hear the bamboo struck; amid the clouds, phoenixes dance in time with the zither’s strings. The ritual chariot follows the green simurgh and white crane—where there is resonance, response comes manifold.

The arising of the Golden Liquid is what the Patriarchs wish people to honor. This birthday is the time when the Golden Liquid is born. The fragrance of tea and the lushness of water-flowers—this compares to its scent like ghee, its sweetness like honey. Only when the breast is cleansed may one partake of the Golden Liquid’s grace, coalescing into a numinous essence, as if beholding the golden radiance’s visage. Such Dao-flavor is not for ordinary people to taste.

Master Chenshangyang said: “When the knife-tip’s measure enters the mouth, circulate your true fire to nurture it.” In the midst of circulating the fire, one suddenly feels the true qi at the spine surging upward to the Mud Pill Palace, trickling with a sound, as if something touches the brain’s center. In an instant, like sparrow’s eggs, bead by bead from beneath the palate down the Tower of Nine Stories, it is cool as ice, rich as ghee, sweet beyond compare. When this state is felt, it confirms the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir—slowly swallow it back to the Cinnabar Field. Thereafter, it flows unceasingly. Closing the eyes to inwardly observe the viscera, each appears as if illuminated by candlelight, gradually enveloped in a golden radiance.

As for harmonizing with the sheng and yong, delighting with drum and bell—this is when the Golden Lord meets the Azure Maiden. Striking bamboo to summon the turtle, the turtle heeds the call; strumming the zither to beckon the phoenix, the phoenix answers the summons—this is the purport of the *Awakening to Reality*. The green simurgh symbolizes the dragon’s vigorous qi; the white crane, the tiger’s vigorous qi. When the dragon swallows the tiger, the inner and outer medicines congeal—where there is resonance, response comes, for sound and qi interflow.

This speaks of the Golden Liquid’s inner medicine, which must unite with the Golden Elixir’s outer medicine before success and felicity are achieved. Confucians revere it to open clarity and wisdom; monastics, to dispel delusion and deafness; Daoists, to rouse from stupor and darkness. Do not divide the Three Sages into three offices—the three teachings take different paths, yet their wonders are the same. Nurturing nature and preserving spirit, all under heaven harmonizes; perceiving nature and stabilizing spirit, the myriad dharmas are empty. The gate of mystery retreats, and many heroes emerge; refining nature and attuning spirit, they unite in one school.

Those who study the true Dao, regardless of the three teachings, need only honor the numinous medicine, coalescing it into the numinous Elixir. Then nurturing nature and preserving spirit, perceiving nature and stabilizing spirit, refining nature and attuning spirit—the three teachings all converge in one school.

The true scripture chants forth in resonant tones, like jade pendants and coral beads chiming exquisitely. As ink swells and recedes, the precious flame blazes—this is how the world should enshroud it in red gauze. It may be transmitted to caution merchants and laborers, displayed to exhort scholars and farmers, used to instruct the world and teach children, recited in every household and enshrined in every shrine, employed to guide toward fortune and avert misfortune—truly a jade resonance that perfects spring.

Carefully perusing the true scripture behind lowered blinds, one comes to know the Three Sages’ beginning and end. At times, it transforms things to flourish verdantly; sweet dew showers the heavens, hanging like hibiscus. The nine chapters’ literary force surges like the Yellow River—each word a precious raft ferrying people. The true scripture is likened to the Golden Liquid. Touching the Mud Pill Palace, it resounds—hence the resonant tones. When the Great Elixir coalesces, it shines like the Buddha’s garlands and the outer elixir’s coral, exquisitely interlaced. As ink swells and recedes, the precious flame blazes—this compares to adding lead and mercury. When the numinous elixir enters the cauldron, the hundred vessels return to their root, encircling and guarding the passes, moving in accord with the talisman’s wrapping—like red gauze enshrouding it. All beings who recognize this may enter the Dao.

The *Triple Concordance* says: “Concealing errors in the multitude of texts, transmitting them to confuse the world, thus causing officials to abandon office, farmers to neglect plowing, merchants to forsake goods, and scholars to suffer poverty—I grieve deeply for them.” The Patriarch shares the same compassion as Wei Boyang, hence the repeated exhortations to enlighten. If one carefully peruses the true scripture, the Three Sages’ beginning and end become known, and the Golden Elixir’s beginning and end also become known.

Mencius’ timely rain, the Great Earth’s sweet dew, Wen Shi’s word-source—all are like this. The Golden Liquid Great Elixir is truly the world’s precious raft. Whether one studies Confucianism, Buddhism, or follows the immortal’s path, without knowing the Three Sages’ wisdom, one remains ordinary. Amidst the teeming multitudes of heaven and earth, may people revere them without negligence or sloth.

The Three Sages’ books are like beans and greens—ready provisions for every household. The Three Sages’ Dao is like the vault of heaven—encompassing the eight directions and four extremes. Facing the scripture and contemplating the sages, one should be solemn and harmonious; let not the numinous terrace be disturbed by restless thoughts. Quietly nurturing the celestial mind like a young plant, the master’s bright moon remains dimly luminous. Moment by moment, guard against carelessness; gently and steadily, deepen your study.

The scripture hall’s four sides are warmed by cloud-like radiance—within, a single heart-flower holds purple down. Entering sagehood and transcending the ordinary rests with me. Those who do not know the Three Sages’ merit will surely fall into ordinariness; those who do not know the Golden Liquid’s Dao cannot become immortals. May people face the scripture and contemplate the sages; may people follow the scripture to refine the Elixir.

The method of refining the Elixir first requires sweeping clean the numinous terrace, allowing no thoughts to disturb it. After coalescing the Elixir, one must quietly nurture the infant, the heart like a bright moon—moment by moment, gently and steadily. This is the ten-month endeavor. The scripture hall symbolizes the Cinnabar Field. The warm cloud’s glow is as the *Awakening to Reality* says: “Within, there is the natural true fire, the furnace’s enduring red blaze.” When a single heart-flower coalesces, entering sagehood and transcending the ordinary rests with you.

Do not forget the lord and father, violating filial piety and loyalty; do not imitate the obstinate, flaunting Chan’s edge; do not follow heterodox paths, falling into confusion and descending into hell’s ghostly throngs.

The Three Sages in heaven shine with dazzling radiance, dispelling the dark and aiding the good to break through the gloom. The true scripture emerges with qi like a rainbow, its luminous brilliance surging toward the Dipper and Ox. Raising high the long sword, leaning upon Mount Kongtong, the celestial immortal and numinous sage is called Three Abundances.

Do not forget these four lines, which admonish one to establish the great foundation and seek the great Dao. The Three Sages in heaven, bright as the gleaming sun, silently protect the virtuous and good, sweeping away calamity and evil—this is like the Nine Returns achieved, the true Yang established and all yin dispersed. The scripture’s qi is like a rainbow, its light blazing and piercing the Dipper and Ox, just as the infant emerging from the womb, breaking through the crown and soaring into the heavens. Today, the long sword raised high, expounding the Dao while leaning upon Mount Kongtong, is none other than the one who attained the great Dao, ascending to the supreme rank—Immortal Master Three Abundances.

After the Three Teachings’ great sages’ numinous and wondrous true scripture—this refers to the completion of the Elixir. These Three Teachings share a common return. The great sages are the great Dao. Their numinous penetration is boundless transformation. The true scripture is the true sage.

*Where does the single Yang originate?*
The scripture’s cultivation is perfected, universally delivering good affinities. Incense congeals into precious talismans, golden lotuses surge from the earth, great Confucians, great Buddhas, great Perfected Immortals. Mounting the phoenix to ascend heaven, one again beholds the solemn three sacred forms. The true scripture’s cultivation is perfected—this means the great Dao is accomplished. Only then can one universally deliver good affinities, attaining the supreme rank. This passage’s intent is expressed in this verse.

The Cavernous Mystery Perfected Person Zhang Xuanyuan, embracing the true scripture, presented it to the world without reserve. Now he speaks again of the Three Sages’ chapter, three chapters completing the nine sages and nine Yangs. On the peak of Seven Curves, Wenchang the Literary Emperor, with Confucian learning, delved into the *Great Cavern*, becoming a divine sage—how could the worthies and sages not cultivate the Dao of immortality? The First Patriarch Bodhidharma, a single lotus stem, bore and protected the great vow-ship, branching into northern and southern lineages without end. The Three Sages’ numinous penetration pervades the eight directions, their cultivation of the body through ascetic practice spanning years. Filial piety, friendship, benevolence, and kindness—all virtues perfected—they broadly practiced the Three Teachings with sincere hearts. Crossing the river to face the wall, their resolve was steadfast, the Dao encompassing the Three Teachings, their spirits at ease. The ten trials on Zhongnan stood firm as mountains—great indeed, the Three Teachings’ shared burden.

People see the joy of non-action and naturalness, but who knows the effort that preceded it? The Patriarchs held the constant Dao, once more proclaiming it to the world, composing the third chapter to complete the number of nine Yangs, symbolizing the accomplishment of the Nine Returns. The three sacred persons all realized the great Dao, yet all arose from ascetic cultivation. As the *Awakening to Reality* says: *“Beginning with effort, none see it; only when non-action is reached do the multitudes know.”* This is the very meaning. Non-action symbolizes the facing-the-wall practice. If one speaks of numinous transformations manifesting, this is the sages’ compassion, yet it is also action in the world.

The Three Sages’ compassion fills the dusty realm, their transformative traces boundless and difficult to recount in detail. For seventeen generations, they served as ministers and nobles—*The Scripture on Hidden Virtue* often speaks of this—an eternal, vast grace worthy of song and praise, a blessing star shining brightly through the celestial palace. In the eastern and western lands, the Mahayana Chan is expounded; how could Shaolin Temple lack affinity? The monks of the Six Dynasties flourished—without the Master, who would have turned the raging tide? Girded with a sword, roaming the seas and skies, teaching the true essence to heroic men and women, inscribing extraordinary names upon mountains and rivers, their fame known even to women and children across the nine provinces.

This speaks figuratively of the Three Sages’ spiritual emanations and numinous transformations. It is hoped that later achievers of the true will also, like the Three Sages, compassionately instruct the world, transform the vulgar, cast out evil, and uphold the right, journeying to the Northern Marchmount in the morning and lodging in Cangwu by evening, universally delivering good affinities.

Now I proclaim this to the aspiring gentlemen ahead: the fruition of merit must be as perfect as the Three Sages’. To become a sage, a Buddha, or an immortal, one’s good heart and capacity must be vast and broad. Without cultivating virtue to nurture the root, one will constantly encounter demonic obstructions. When the Dao is accomplished, one may conceal one’s traces amidst the mortal world, ascending the immortal ranks in days to come.

This encourages later generations to aspire to the Three Sages, reverently pursuing merit, broadly cultivating virtue, and only then achieving the great Dao. The Three Sages’ hearts are like sweet springs, their abundant blessings flowing ceaselessly to aid later worthies. Had Qinghe forgotten the human world, why would he have manifested as a magistrate? Had Dharma concealed himself in nirvana, how would the five branches have spread to the western shore? Had Huiweng remained forever apart from the mundane, who would have delivered Kings He and Liu? The Three Sages’ hearts are most deeply entwined—who among later generations will follow in their footsteps?

This speaks of the Three Sages’ merits in reverse. Had the Three Sages, upon attaining the Dao, remained entirely concealed, how could there be such great compassion and such vast Dharma lineages? Though “who follows in their footsteps” seems the Patriarchs’ self-reference, it also exhorts later students.

Now I expound these words without fear of tedium, hoping others will diligently advance to exhaust the jade caskets. The Literary Patriarch’s true scripture unfolds the wondrous simurgh, annotated and interwoven with the *Great Cavern*, encompassing the numinous Elixir. The Enlightened Patriarch’s true scripture is seen in poetic seals, treasured within the abdomen to nurture the Mud Pill. As the Patriarch Bodhidharma’s verses say: *“Within the abdomen, the true scripture is circulated; the Mud Pill distinguishes host and guest.”* The Perfected Patriarch Lü’s true scripture is vast in scope, its poems, lyrics, songs, and discourses resounding with rhythm. Delivering ten thousand beings, ten thousand rejoice, his majestic precious carriage halts amidst the clouds.

This speaks figuratively of the Three Sages’ writings, all centered on the highest Elixir Dao. Wenchang the Literary Emperor, originally a Confucian, delved into the *Great Cavern* and became a divine sage—how could the worthies and sages not study the Dao of immortality? The First Patriarch Bodhidharma also likened Buddhism to the refinement of the golden Elixir, becoming a divine monk—how could true Buddhists not seek the Dao of immortality? As for Perfected Lü, that goes without saying. Delivering ten thousand beings, the Three Sages’ boundless hearts reveal the common source of the Three Teachings!

I wish all beings to prostrate with reverence, burning sandalwood incense on every auspicious birthday. Flowers, water, fruit, and lamps—pure and fresh—dust swept clean, the pine pass flung wide open.

Silently reciting the true scriptures, one beholds the sacred countenance—
a wheel of oceanic sun ascends three poles high,
crimson clouds spanning ten thousand miles illumine the great chiliocosm.

As if the deaf and mute were bearing the imperial carriage,
as if the flying tin-staff whirled midair,
once more red clouds rise from azure skies,
laughing to welcome the yellow cranes in dance.

Heavenly gods and marshals brandish thunder-whips,
the Three Sages ride the wind into purple mist.
This is but the symbolic manifestation of the Three Sages.
*Lingtong* (spiritual communion) illustrates the wondrous function of spirit-exit.
*Auspicious birth* compares to the moment of rebirth.
*Pine pass* compares to the upper cinnabar field.
Only when the dust of defilements is wholly shed does one return to emptiness.
*Beholding the sacred countenance* signifies seeing the dharmic image of one’s own body.
*The sun’s ascent and clouds’ radiance* symbolize the light of spirit.
The Three Sages’ *fajia* (dharma-chariot) is likened to the present *fajia*.
*The marshals’ thunder-whips*—these are the celestial guards in escort,
a single thunderclap beyond the heavens.

Do not say the planchette’s sand is hard to scale—
to this day, its teachings remain as vast as hills.
Do not claim the single sandal was left in the marketplace—
to this day, his disheveled locks still wander afar.
Do not suppose his true dwelling was confined to the Three Isles—
to this day, he often descends upon the altar of Mount Yue’s clouds.
This is but an illustration of the Three Sages’ *lingtong*.
Not only did they attain the Dao in their time and manifest in the world,
but even now, their teachings still enlighten the mortal realm,
their divine virtue unceasing.

The ode says:
*Nature’s capacity is perfect, the Dharma pervades the dust-mote realms.*
*Though the ten thousand conditions are stilled, the One True remains free.*
*Beholding all forms through myriad ages,*
*guiding the deluded multitudes, true cultivation never decays.*

How fine are these verses!

Alas! The Three Sages’ majestic grace spreads far—
may all people stand in awe before their solemnity.
To expound the true scriptures and compose commentaries,
one need not consult divination or pray for lots.
Only by accumulating virtue and nurturing purity
will divine blessings naturally descend in succession.
Wenchang’s brush-recordings are all false transmissions,
why study the barbarian monk’s staff-verses?
*The Numinous Treasure’s Perfect Methods* need not be pored over—
the true scriptures’ wondrous essence is like an acupuncture needle’s prick,
on the jade terrace, expounding the Dharma with beard raised in mirth.

This is but an illustration that those who partake of the Three Sages’ grace
must embody the Three Sages’ true Dao.
The Patriarch’s true scriptures are the grand vow memorial of cultivators.
Simply aspire to accumulate virtue and nurture integrity,
to perfect the great Dao—
no need to cast lots or seek divination slips.
After attaining the Dao, divine blessings will be bestowed in succession,
as if by repeated celestial decrees.
Those who falsely study brush-recordings,
seeking the Literary Emperor to awaken wisdom;
who idly discuss staff-verses,
claiming the Buddha’s Dharma was originally thus;
who practice *The Numinous Treasure* merely to ward off illness and prolong life—
all these are not the true transmission of the Three Sages.
The Patriarch composed three great scriptures, marking the great Dao,
justly serving as the world’s acupuncture needle.
An ancient immortal said:
*Why does this heart open the great Dao?*
*Only because it originally came from within the Dao.*
The Patriarch’s compassionate heart—
is it not the same as the Three Sages’!

The Master’s beard was most splendid.
In years past, wandering through Yunnan and Guizhou,
people called him “Zhang the Handsome-Bearded.”
Ascending the platform to expound the Dharma,
one could almost see him raise his beard in a smile.

*The Wondrous Dharma of Salvation: Precious Repentance to the Heavenly Worthies of the Highest True Scripture*
*Opening Verse*

Amidst the Great Harmony, a single qi turns the vast primordial chaos,
The teachings unfold in the mortal realm beneath the radiant moon’s glow.
Embracing the ten thousand phenomena, towering peaks stand in solemn array,
Compassion and literary grace adorn the brocade of his heart.

Forging the primordial Yellow and Mysterious qi,
Silently breathing the winds through the bellows and pipes.
The scripture serves as Heaven’s mouth, speaking to the lofty firmament.

At that time, the Most August Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal, Supreme Lord of the Highest Heaven, sat enthroned in the boundless expanse of his dominion, gazing down from the flaming heavens of Yama. Crimson clouds bore his throne, his body emanating thirty-two hues of sacred light, illuminating the world below. With sagely concern, he deigned to utter a jade decree, instructing the attendant ministers at his side, and addressed the assembly:

*"Now, as the seas and lands bask in the blessings of peace, many among the multitudes cultivate goodness. Yet one who practices virtue solely for oneself must also extend it to others; without such extension, even goodness is not truly good. Your vows are vast and profound—you must seize this moment to propagate the teachings, subtly aiding the flourishing dynasty. Let benevolent winds spread far, and nurturing rains fall ceaselessly. Surpass all others in compassion, and the ranks of immortals shall elevate you beyond sacred realms."*

Then, the Jade Void Preceptor, True Martial Sovereign of the Dark Warrior, bowed deeply and spoke: *"Your servant has nurtured the true Great Harmony since the time of the Yellow Emperor, attaining the supreme Dao and humbly serving in the Purple Empyrean for over four thousand years. Now, a single individual has emerged—descended from the Heavenly Master—styled Quanyi. He has amassed great merit and conduct, wielding profound spiritual powers, dispelling evil, expounding the true, and disseminating teachings to the enlightened and wise. At the Southern Culmen Assembly, he was enfeoffed as the Successor Martial Perfected, for his radiance illumines the Great Harmony, and his Daoist footsteps follow mine. The Most Supreme of the Jade Clarity bestowed the title 'Vast Compassion and Universal Salvation'; the Most Supreme of the Highest Clarity, 'Flying Dragon and Worldly Deliverance'; and the Most Supreme of the Grand Clarity, 'Perfected Lord of Literary Distinction.' The southwestern provinces have repeatedly received his boundless grace. I deem this Perfected One fully capable of great tasks, yet fear his rank may be too humble to widely propagate the teachings. If granted further favor, he will surely not betray your trust. Now, he has come to the August Heaven to respectfully present his petition."*

The Supreme Lord, upon hearing this, beamed with celestial joy and commanded that he be summoned to court without delay. The Perfected Lord then entered in full dignity, prostrating before the throne. His dark radiance enveloped his crown, and the sacred gaze upon him was filled with delight. The Emperor declared: *"Excellent! You, Perfected Lord Quanyi, deeply comprehend the great Dao. The Preceptor’s praise has already revealed your virtue. Indeed, you have extended your heart with boundless generosity, unfolding the mysterious scriptures. I now command the immortal historians of the Celestial Gardens to compose a precious proclamation on your behalf, bestowing upon you glory and honor. Henceforth, you, Perfected Lord Quanyi, shall be elevated to the rank of Sovereign Lord of the Cavernous Mystery, Right Minister of the Jade Void, and Assistant to the Heavenly Master in the Dharma. You shall oversee all directions without restraint, acting with full authority. Traverse the eight extremities above and below, and should you achieve merit without fault, further honors shall be bestowed."*

The jade decree descended, and the Perfected Lord received his mandate with reverence.

Having received the Perfected Lord’s obeisance, the Emperor withdrew to the Golden Palace and took his seat in the Vermilion Jade Hall. The Heavenly Master and his ministers then commanded the attendants of the Mysterious Heaven to escort the Sovereign Lord of the Cavernous Mystery on a tour of the Northern Culmen, where a three-day banquet was held in his honor. The assembled Perfected Ones and stellar hosts purified the rites and offered farewell libations. Thereafter, he roamed freely through the Three Clarities, where august instructions were graciously bestowed.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning spoke:
*"Before Heaven and Earth were divided, vast and indistinct they hung in chaos. The Five dwelt within the Ten, the Mysterious Pivot at the Yellow Center. The myriad things took form in the womb, nurtured by the Three Powers. Stillness gave rise to movement, and the primal chaos first unfolded."*

He further expounded the supreme Dharma-teachings:
*"The qi of Great Harmony is sown in the Father of Qian. As the eldest son of Zhen, it is born of the Mother of Kun. Emerging as the sun and entering as the moon, it opens the gate and closes the door. Grasping yin and yang, it is the root and ancestor of the Dao. Should one encounter it, life shall extend for ten thousand ages."*

The Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure declared:
*"Following the Dao, one becomes human; reversing it, one refines the elixir. The method of elixir-craft lies in yielding and humility. Establishing the center generates correctness; in utter stillness, one ascends. Below, close the earthly gate; above, open the heavenly portal. Whoever beholds this shall preserve the Dao-qi eternally. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances, guard my Dharma-body. The Fire Talisman dispels all demons; a single point enters the Yellow Court."*

In essential words, without prolixity, the Celestial Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue said:
*"The essence of the Supreme Dao does not lie in verbose speech. Cast aside external distractions, and concentrate the spirit in the Cinnabar Field. The human heart forgets and forgets again; the celestial breath flows on, unbroken. Moving within the inner chamber, follow its spontaneity. Whether long or short, whether before or after, the generative qi surges like a turning wheel. Practice this with purity, and one may attain immortality."*

In essential words, without prolixity, the instructions of the heavens were concluded.

The August Celestial Envoy arrived, bestowing once more a jade-bound chapter, along with a precious scepter, a sacred seal, a divine sword, a ceremonial tablet, a Nine-Virtue Reclining Moon Crown, a Seven-Star Jade Hairpin, a mantle of plain silk and brocade clouds, a robe of purple silk and floral embroidery, a crimson skirt of feathered hues, an Eight-Treasure Weightless Robe, Jade Sandals of Primordial Radiance, a Golden Chariot of Flying Clouds, a canopy of jade wheels adorned with feathers, wielding the Nine-Radiance Staff and bearing the Ten-Perfection Banner. Before him soared twin phoenixes; behind followed eight simurghs. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders illuminated the pure void.

Facing the celestial palace, he offered boundless gratitude. The Perfected Sovereign then bowed in farewell to the Celestial Worthies and Upper Saints, receiving their mandate to propagate the teachings. The Cavernous Mystery Perfected Sovereign descended to the Cloud-Wandering Pavilion, unfurling the vessel of deliverance for the world—this very sutra as its root and origin.

At that time, the Sky of Leaks had rained for days unending; the summer month congealed with cold. The people sighed in distress, their grain and millet submerged. As the Dharma assembly commenced, auspicious mists gathered thickly, propitious vapors descended in waves. A pure breeze scattered gently; bright stars mirrored the waters. At dawn, the sun emerged from the mountains, and he ascended the Wondrous Terrace to inaugurate the sacred instructions.

The Perfected Sovereign declared: *"How vast! The subtlety of the Supreme Dao is made luminous through words; the essence of the utmost encounter is rendered lucid through speech. The sutra may serve as Dharma—revere the sacred scriptures to model my Dharma. The sutra is the eternal Dao—revere the sacred scriptures to embody my Dao. It is neither possessed of dharma-form nor devoid of dharma-form; in daily practice and cultivation, dharma-form manifests. It is neither named as Dao nor unnamed as Dao; in the principles and norms of affairs, this is the name of Dao. Those who follow the sutra shall flourish; those who defy it shall perish. I proclaim the Dharma broadly across the seas, I expound the wonders of the Dao to distant lands, I guide the virtuous to the realm of immortals."*

He further said: *"Between heaven and humanity, there exist but two paths: blessing the good and calamity for the licentious. Thus, those who do good are granted a thousand auspices; those who do evil are visited by a hundred misfortunes. The cultivator who attains perfect goodness finds the heart settled, the six dusts unperturbed, the six roots thereby purified, the Three Corpses expelled, the Five Thieves eradicated. The Corpses and Thieves cannot unleash their poison; misfortune and harm cannot draw near. Within the accumulation of goodness lies the method to dispel calamity. It is not that after accumulating goodness does good fortune arise; rather, in the very moment of forsaking evil, evil retribution ceases. The Three Sagely Canons are boundless in their measure of goodness; the Three Sagely Sutras universally deliver through karmic affinity. Why do people not strive to practice them?"*

The Perfected Sovereign declared: "Now that the sacred scriptures are complete, all should revere and uphold them. The great assemblies of the ten directions and the multitudes of the six directions—when chanting these jade-like chapters, you must cherish their precious teachings. To read scriptures is to cultivate oneself; to expound sutras is first to deliver others. When compassion is widely bestowed, blessings and prosperity will ascend. Thus, I admonish you, faithful men and devout women: on every auspicious occasion, burn incense and prostrate in worship. Whether in secluded chambers or quiet pavilions, sweep the altar and open the texts, ever holding three great vows to amass boundless merit.

The first vow: may the sovereign be benevolent and sagely, and all people and creatures thrive.
The second vow: may parents enjoy robust health, and the clan flourish together.
The third vow: may lost souls and lingering spirits be delivered across the world to transcendence.

Hold these rare and measureless aspirations, aligning with the Three Non-Intentions. Without seeking fortune, fortune will descend of itself; without averting misfortune, misfortune will subside of itself. Wherever this scripture is chanted, gods and ghosts alike lend their ears. Let this decree be followed—all should revere and trust it."

The Perfected Sovereign declared: "The scriptural text is most weighty; reverent participation is supreme. The ancients said: utmost sincerity moves the divine, and the gods’ chariots descend from the void—people must offer utmost reverence. Do not boast of rare treasures from land and water, nor adorn the ritual feast with elaborate implements. Let the heart be pure, the chamber serene, and qi gather like fragrant mist. As if beholding the honored ranks of the sagely host—the Three Origins and Five Peaks, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, the three isles of the sea—all divine spirits descend upon your crown, arrayed in devotion, palms joined in reverence."

With sincere devotion, recite the sacred names and bow in worship—one name, one prostration:

With sincere devotion, this disciple bows in homage.

After thrice invoking and thrice bowing to the Divine Lord of the Cavernous Mystery, the Most High Emperor—

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthies and August Emperors gathered in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, descending upon the Palace of Empty Luminosity. The Three Pure Ones took their high seats, while the ranks of sages arrayed themselves in the center. Then a lofty perfected one, the Lord Emperor of Sincere Protection, stepped forth from the assembly, bowed his head, and addressed the Heavenly Worthies:

*"This disciple now observes that in the world below, a field of good affinity has arisen from the southwest. The great scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery are being opened, delivering countless beings. In accordance with the teachings, virtue is being disseminated to renew the people. The grace of Heaven knows no bounds. Your servant humbly offers the* Hymn of Praise to the *Scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery:*"

The *Scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery* are the precious instructions of the Heavenly Worthies, the auspicious radiance of the Four Great Continents.
Wherever these scriptures reside, the ten thousand spirits all protect;
Wherever these scriptures reside, the ten thousand immortals lend their aid.

Thereupon, the *Great Repentance of the Cavernous Mystery* was recited, and thanks were offered for the grace of Heaven.

When the Lord Emperor of Sincere Protection had finished reciting this hymn, he respectfully entreated the Divine Lord of the Cavernous Mystery to unfurl the jade case of the Golden Portal and to awaken the world with the thunderous voice of the Dao. The assembled perfected ones and ranks of sages all listened attentively.

Thereupon, the Divine Lord of the Cavernous Mystery began...

The August Heavenly Thearch’s precious instructions were proclaimed to the people below, saying: *"Compassion and purity form the heart of the Dao. Humility, harmony, sincerity, and silence form the conduct of the Dao. Loftiness, luminosity, breadth, and depth form the gate of the Dao. Nurturing the Three Wondrous Spirits forms the root of the Dao. The Dao values knowing death, for only then can one know life. It also values knowing life, for only then is the knowledge of death true. Without limit is death; the Supreme Ultimate is life. Its essence is profound and pure; its qi is vast and undifferentiated. Its spirit is empty and still. Its Dao is perfectly complete. Those who comprehend this ascend to the Azure Heavens."*

The Heavenly King of Dao and Virtue declared: *"The Three Teachings share a single source, one scripture for all ages. Assist my mysterious wind, propagate our true Dao. You, the assembled immortals, why not join in praise?"* Thereupon, the ranks of sages and perfected ones pressed their palms together, sang in response, and withdrew in harmonious voices.

Next, the Great Emperor of the Dark Heaven approached the throne of the Jade Void, entered the court of the Golden Portal, reverently presented the jade case, and earnestly entreated the bestowal of precious decrees. The decree proclaimed:

*"Prime Minister of the Jade Void, exalted perfected one of the Golden Portal. Your virtue flows between humans and spirits; your scriptures open the paths of the well and the dead. You have broadened the merit and conduct of the Three Thousand, awakening the myriad lost in delusion. Once you attained perfection on the Primordial Peak, now you succeed the Dark Heaven in unfolding transformation. Upholding the true teaching without bias or partiality, refuting heterodox paths with resounding clarity. You have executed the false practitioners of the cosmos, restoring the ancestral wind of Dao and virtue. Pointing to the prior heavens and facing the moon, summoning later disciples to ascend the clouds. The wondrous Dao is without fixed form; its mysteries are unfathomable. Utmost spirit, utmost sage, utmost great, utmost honored—your body harmonizes with nature, your spirit congeals in prajñā, the true sovereign of the Three Teachings, the qi of unified authority, the Dharma Heaven Master, Cavernous Mystery Emperor Lord, Dragon-like Six Patriarchs, concealed immortals dwelling in transformation, subtle and universal deliverance—Most High Heavenly Worthy."*

The Cavernous Mystery Emperor Lord bowed to receive the decree.

The myriad heavenly deities and sages then returned to their celestial palaces. Only radiant clouds drifted gently, and the resplendent sun shone brightly. The Emperor Lord returned to his original altar and expounded this scripture, addressing the world’s people thus:

May this merit extend through ten thousand generations,
And all sentient beings together attain the supreme Dao.

With devoted hearts, they bowed and chanted thrice the *Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of the Myriad Heavens* before withdrawing.

The *Cavernous Mystery Scripture* is the vessel for transcending the world. All within its teachings are the celestial instructions and Dharma words of the heavens. Our Master Three Peaks, following the scripture’s guidance, elucidated its profound mysteries and penetrated its subtle wonders. Thus was he enfeoffed as the Cavernous Mystery Emperor Lord and thus proclaimed this *True Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery*. Those who encounter it by karmic affinity must treasure and revere it.

Disciple Xiyue respectfully records this.

*The Scripture of Perfect Enlightenment in Bodhi*
A Verse:
Expounding the scripture, revealing wonders beyond the dust,
Three drumrolls of clouds ascend the Dharma throne.
The sun climbs the peak and swiftly passes,
Yet should return, crimson, to another mountain’s embrace.

The Bodhi declares: In times past, I dwelt in the Taihe Hermitage, diligently cultivating the Mysterious Teachings, inwardly embracing true suchness. Concealed or manifest, I delivered beings, appearing in myriad forms, employing myriad expedient means. I assiduously established merit and conduct, awaiting the celestial mandate. Though dust and grime covered my robes, I ever delighted in my tranquility.

Daily I sat beneath the Bodhi tree with my disciple Yuanqing and all the bhikṣu assembly, all of whom had attained perfection. Behold this wondrous seed of Bodhi—fragrance without fragrance, yet its fragrance is universally perceived; light without light, yet its light shines everywhere. Fragrance and light pervade all, yet all arises from no-mind.

I contemplated the supreme vehicle of the Buddha, wherein the original nature is complete, compassion universally protects, and natural quiescence illumines—all without contrivance. This is called Bodhi. The noble name of Bodhi truly originates here.

In former times, I journeyed in spirit to the Western Heaven, paying homage to the World-Honored One. I sought the Buddha’s intent and silently aligned with the Chan lineage. The World-Honored One rejoiced greatly and commanded its propagation, addressing the great assembly thus:

*"Divine light radiates brilliantly, the ocean of nature is limpid and clear.
Within the dust yet beyond it, concealed in the world yet delivering the world.
Manifesting as a healer to rescue the imperiled and relieve the distressed,
Advocating for the multitude to expound the Dao and transmit the scriptures.
Having realized the fruit of the Great Luo Golden Immortal,
Your Dao equals that of the Venerable Bodhidharma.
Great Benevolence, Great Vows, Great Compassion, Great Mercy—
Mysterious and Profound Ancestral Master, Savior from Calamities,
Heavenly Worthy of the Unkempt and Serene Light,
Buddha-Bodhisattva Mahāsattva!"*

The following day, I traveled to Potalaka in the Southern Sea, gazing upon the Venerable One. The sound of the tide was vast, the Buddha’s Dharma boundless. I sought the Buddha’s intent and attained the shared essence of the Śākya lineage. Thereupon, I recited the *Scripture of the Wondrous Bodhi*, extolling compassion. The King of Awakening, Avalokiteśvara, anointed me with sweet dew and bestowed a secret mantra to augment my merit.

Having made pilgrimage to both West and South, the fragrance and light flourished equally. The Dharma pervaded the dusty realms, the nature-body was perfectly replete, and the great vehicle of Śākya Buddha accorded entirely with my Dao. Now, with the burning of incense and the sounding of the drum, we recite the *Bodhi* aloud.

What is meant by "Śākya"?
The World-Honored One said: *"I favor Śākya, thus I established the teaching under Śākya, signifying the relinquishment of all entanglements."*

What is meant by "Buddha"?
The Compassionate Ferry said: *"I favor Buddha, thus I embodied the Buddha to establish the teaching, signifying the awakening of all beings."*

Thus have I heard: The Śākya Lord departs the world.
Thus have I heard: The Buddha Lord awakens the world.

Within Śākya, there is Buddha, yet no fragrance or light—yet fragrance and light arise spontaneously, like Bodhi.
Within Buddha, there is Śākya, with fragrance and light—yet originally no fragrance or light, also like Bodhi.

The scriptures of Śākya and the sūtras of Buddha serve but to transcend worldly defilement and awaken the deluded.

Therefore, the World-Honored One is pure, and the Compassionate Ferry is likewise pure. The World-Honored One encompasses purity, while the Compassionate Ferry universally purifies. There is no attachment to purity, no destruction of purity, no stinginess with purity—even to the point of no purity, non-purity, non-purity, yet also purity. This is the great purity, the perfect purity.

Those who chant the *Bodhi* shall attain a pure heart and a prajñā heart. Yet having attained prajñā, one forgets prajñā. To not forget prajñā is not prajñā; to be not prajñā is not called prajñā; to be not not-prajñā is true prajñā. Those who attain prajñā are called Śākya, may become Śākya, possess Śākya-Śākya, are Śākya yet not possess Śākya-Śākya, are Śākya yet inherently possess Śākya-Śākya.

They are called Buddha, may become Buddha, possess Buddha-Buddha, are Buddha yet not possess Buddha-Buddha, are Buddha yet inherently possess Buddha-Buddha.

Thus is the World-Honored One, thus is the Compassionate Ferry, and thus are the śramaṇa and bhikṣus.

Can one become Śākya without being thus?
No.

Can one become Buddha without being thus?
No.

Why is this so?

To be Śākya is Śākya; not to be Śākya is not Śākya.
To be Buddha is Buddha; not to be Buddha is not Buddha.
Why is this so?
Beyond Śākya there is no Śākya; to grasp Śākya is to be Śākya.
Beyond Buddha there is no Buddha; to grasp Buddha is to be Buddha.
Why is this so?
Śākya-Śākya-Śākya-intent—yet there is no Śākya-intent, only the intent of Śākya itself.
Buddha-Buddha-Buddha-thought—yet there is no Buddha-thought, only the true thought of Buddha.
To be not-Śākya yet Śākya is the supreme vehicle; to be not-Buddha yet Buddha is the great vehicle.
The scriptural treasury of Buddha and Śākya is thus the treasury of Śākya-Buddha, called the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye.

When the bodhisattva had spoken thus, at that moment blue phoenixes and white phoenixes intertwined, harmonizing in perfect celebration. All the bhikṣus and assembly rejoiced greatly, marveled at this rarity, bowed in reverence, and upheld the teaching. Then they recited the *Compassionate Ferry Mantra*, saying:

*"Bodhi truth, bodhi gate-truth,
Gate-bodhi truth, truth-gate-bodhi truth,
Bodhisattva truth, bodhi mahā-sattva."*

The *Bodhi Sutra* was obtained at West Lake’s Cijing Temple from the Venerable Ruzhan. The Venerable was a Dharma-grandson of Master Xu, a great monk of Jiangnan. From youth, he mastered Chan principles and devoted himself to the Mahāyāna. In later years, he presided over Cijing Temple and deeply revered this sutra. After his passing, Ruzhan treasured it for over twenty years. In the early Daoguang era, he traveled to Mount Emei. Fellow practitioners met with Ruzhan and found great affinity; thus, he revealed this sutra, saying that within the profound teachings lay this bodhi, yet people did not recognize it. At that time, Messrs. Liu and Yang were compiling the complete work and, having obtained this text, reverently transcribed and preserved it.

*Transmitted by the Buddha Lata Jingguang on behalf of the Great Compassionate One of Putuo: The Mind-Dharma Divine Mantra of Great Mercy*

The Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, from samādhi’s gaze, looked down upon the sea of suffering, sweeping away all unwholesome paths with the broom of Akṣobhya. Universally wishing that all beings in the three-thousandfold great-thousandfold world—whether koṭi, saṅkhyeya, or koti-koti—turn their hearts toward goodness, that their virtuous minds become as mighty as Nārāyaṇa, without distinction among all beings in the three-thousandfold great-thousandfold world—what are Pindola, what are Bharadvāja?—all may ascend to pāramitā, all may attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.

Then was spoken the *Dhāraṇī True Words*:

*"Oṃ, thought after thought, thought after thought,
Avinivartanīya-tathatāya,
Mahā-bodhi, bodhisattva,
Kānta-hṛdaya, bodhi mahā-sattva."*

Homage to Avalokiteśvara,
who personally transmitted the *Great Compassion Mantra*.
May this merit awaken boundless multitudes.

Threefold homage to the Great Compassionate Lord, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara Mahāsattva.

*Idle Talks by the Water and Stone*

Master Zhang says: The world says one must read for ten years and cultivate qi for ten years. By separating reading and qi-cultivation into two distinct matters, they fail to grasp the learning of the sages and worthies. Reading is for investigating principle; cultivating qi is for refining one’s nature. The work of nature and principle lies precisely in the unobstructed simultaneity of reading and qi-cultivation. The Sage declared: *“Learn and practice it at due times.”* This alone suffices for the ceaseless refinement and unification of nature and principle.

Master Zhang says: Tao Yuanming reclined beneath his northern window, calling himself a man of the era of Fuxi. This reveals his lofty integrity and unyielding spirit, evoking the grandeur of a bygone dynasty—his words were merely too transcendent for others to perceive.

Master Zhang says: The Daoist hopes that scholars will swiftly fulfill their ambitions for fame and office, exhaust their human duties, and then promptly let go. One who retires after achieving success does so at the right moment. The danger lies in drowning in the pursuit of fame and fortune, clinging endlessly—such a person is a fool.

Master Zhang says: Within nurturing lies great learning; within harmony resides true nature. You must tolerate what others cannot tolerate, endure what others cannot endure. Then the mind grows ever more serene, and the nature ever more pure.

Master Zhang says: Fame and office, great or small, must be advanced or withdrawn in due time. How can one know the right time? Simply reflect calmly within the pursuit of fame and office: *“My fame and office will not exceed this.”* If you can rise to this, you have grasped the moment. Or if there seems no end, better to fall short than to overreach. Han Xin was not the equal of Zhang Liang; Yuan Zhen was not the equal of Bai Juyi—both were blinded by their insatiable ambition. Had Zhang Liang or Bai Juyi also harbored such desires, Zhang could easily have risen again to the highest offices, and Bai could have been promoted to prime minister. Yet how could one be certain they would not have met the same ignoble ends as Han Xin or Yuan Zhen? Thus, only those who know when to advance and when to retreat deserve to be called wise.

Master Zhang sighs deeply: The years drift by like shadows, and I see in the world those who chase fame and fortune—some seize high rank in an instant, others amass great wealth in a few years. Among thousands, barely a handful succeed. Even if they attain lofty titles and vast power, these cannot overawe the Lord of the Underworld; gold and jade cannot buy exemption from impermanence. Some may live long in wealth, or rest secure in nobility, yet in the end, all return to the poplar-shaded grave, where autumn winds wail and the chill pierces the heart. If their descendants are unworthy, the estate crumbles in the blink of an eye—what benefit was there? Moreover, those of sudden wealth or sudden rank often fear slander, curses, and malicious gossip. If they fail to do good, others’ curses may wither them on the spot or reduce them to poverty—everyone rejoices, each heart gladdened. Yet Heaven’s retribution is clear and unshaken, not swayed by human words. If one can see through this and let go, one will naturally cease to envy others’ wealth or status. Seek instead the principle of contentment with one’s lot, and uphold the Dao of self-cultivation. While others clamor noisily, I remain silent; while others fret in vexation, I abide in cool clarity. Why trouble oneself over others’ success or failure, wealth or poverty, or the world’s injustices?

Master Zhang says: Lifespan is fixed for those above, fixed for those below, but uncertain for those in between. The middling sort, neither wholly good nor wholly evil, cannot be prolonged by Heaven, nor can they be cut short—thus, they are left to live or die as fate decrees. Preservation depends on cultivation. Cultivate the body and accumulate merit through virtuous deeds to aspire to longevity and enduring vision. As for the lowest sort, burdened with many faults and evils, even cultivation cannot grant them long life. Their essence and qi are stripped away, and they are punished with death. The highest sort are different. If they cultivate longevity, they may attain it. Even if they choose not to pursue it, their upright qi sustains them among the ranks of divine beings. Otherwise, they may return to the human world, but will surely be born into a family of benevolence and goodness. Such is the principle of Heaven—what is difficult to understand?

Master Zhang says: Since ancient times, when men of loyalty, integrity, and heroic resolve sacrificed themselves to perfect their humanity, they manifested the vision of the sevenfold returning elixir. In that moment of undivided heart and unwavering resolve, their vast and upright qi arose within, and they regarded blades, saws, cauldrons, and boiling oil as mere illusions testing their resolve, remaining unmoved. They gathered and concentrated their righteous qi, solidifying it into indestructible firmness. At this stage of the alchemical fire, the radiance of the hero’s spirit endures for ten thousand years without fading. When Daoist adepts enter the chamber to tend the furnace, they must possess this same resolve.

Master Zhang says: While one’s parents are alive, one should fulfill filial duties in a timely manner. Otherwise, once their faces are gone, regret and sorrow over lost opportunities will be unspeakable.

Today, amidst the autumn mountains and forests, let those observing mourning rites heed my words:

*"Again the autumn winds sweep through the woods,
Beyond azure clouds, a heart yearns for kin.
Yellow reeds and white grass wither in the frost—
How deep the tears that wet the Yellow Springs!"*

Recite this poem, and who would not be stricken with sorrow?

Master Zhang says: In matters of filial piety, each must fully follow their innate conscience. Though methods may differ, they all converge in the single word "filial." To spare your family’s longing, you should return home to serve your parents; to seek honor and renown, you should dedicate yourself to the imperial path. If you wish to preserve your body as a form of filial devotion, you must curb desires and purify the heart—empty words are of no benefit. You disciples, though you may not yet have achieved distinction or returned home often, would do better to curb desires and purify the heart, embodying the teachings of the sages Zeng and Meng. If you do not purify the heart and curb desires, you will vainly chase fame without attaining it, pursue profit without success, and seek all things in vain. Your body and spirit will wither, and while your parents’ faces may yet show no signs of age, you, their child, will already bear the weariness of old age. You may speak of filial piety, but it will not endure long—only to bring your parents worry over your illness and anxiety over your distant travels. Should misfortune strike and you, their child, die, you would only add to their grief, forcing them to bury you. Reflecting on this, where is the filial piety? Would you not become a lifelong sinner?

The Dao takes purifying the heart and curbing desires as its foundation, for this is truly the way to preserve the body. Add to this a gentle countenance, respectful demeanor, and sincere intent, and you will attain filial piety.

Master Zhang says: After Confucian scholars achieve literary honors, many take up positions as private tutors. Know that accepting such posts to support one’s parents is also a convenient path for Confucians. Yet Confucius and Mencius bequeathed the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* to later generations not to teach profit-seeking. In later times, when such remuneration became customary, using it to serve one’s parents is but a minor application with minor effect. Still, one must not be insatiably greedy, scheming for the ease of descendants and turning the classics into a den of profit—lest one become a sinner against the sages.

Master Zhang says: Those who wish to fulfill loyalty and filial piety and establish great integrity must first purify the heart and cultivate qi. Without a true heart and true qi, one cannot fully realize loyalty, filial piety, or great integrity. For loyalty arises from the true heart, and great integrity originates from true qi. To attain true heart and true qi, one must prioritize stillness, for only then can the true heart be preserved and true qi cultivated.

Master Zhang says: Seek inner joy, not outer joy. Confucius found joy within—this is inner joy. If you merely desire external things, you seek outer joy only to invite vexation.

Master Zhang says: Many Confucian scholars suffer from seminal loss, caused not only by impure heart-fire but also by staying up all night in conversation or reading, dissipating the qi of the *dantian* through ceaseless chatter, leaving essence without its companion and thus leading to seminal loss. Those who wisely preserve their bodies should speak less and read with moderation.

A young man once suffered from lethargy and weakness. Master Zhang said: "You should take advantage of these clear winter days. Move small stones to build a low wall, carry a mountain hoe to clear dead grass, and stop when you grow hungry. Do this daily, moving leisurely like a gardener, and your entire body’s qi and blood will flow freely without stagnation."

Master Zhang says: The heroic and outstanding do good deeds and act virtuously solely to follow what their hearts deem right, without harboring thoughts of seeking blessings through goodness. The luminous Lord on High has only the principle of blessing the good and punishing the licentious to govern ordinary people, not to reward the heroic. While the heroic may rightfully receive blessings for their goodness, this is not always the case. Yet their resounding deeds and virtuous actions endure through heaven and earth for a thousand years without decay. Their spirits feast on fragrant offerings in the unseen realm—how is this not the heavens’ reward for the heroic? I observe that throughout history, loyal ministers, filial children, righteous scholars, and benevolent people often meet untimely deaths or endure hardships, and I sigh in lament and sudden realization.

Master Zhang says: For Confucians, reading to establish character is an urgent task, and the way of preserving the body encompasses the establishment of character. To preserve the body, one must abandon arrogance, extravagance, dissipation, and excess, sweeping away depraved conduct—thus, preserving the body includes establishing character. The way of preserving the body was transmitted by Master Zeng and expanded by Mencius. Nurturing the heart and curbing desires, holding fast to one’s will and guarding one’s qi—these are the guiding principles of preserving the body. The Dao of self-cultivation takes this as its orthodox path. Yet people’s hearts are obscured: they dismiss preserving the body as commonplace and regard self-cultivation as strange. Thus, those who seek to understand self-cultivation and awaken to the Dao are already rare.

Master Zhang says: Without the teachings of Confucius and Mencius for a single day, the world would have no good people; without the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi for a single day, heroes would have no retreat.

The layman Wang once said that abstaining from meat removes its influence. Master Zhang replied: Meat and vegetables are not the same. Daoists abstain from the five pungent plants—medical texts list scallions, leeks, Chinese chives, garlic, and mustard greens. These five are acrid and foul-smelling, dispersing qi, hence the character for "pungent" (*xūn*) combines "grass" (*cǎo*) and "army" (*jūn*), as if to say they are "soldiers among the grasses," all possessing attacking properties. Those who cultivate qi avoid them. Buddhists emphasize vegetarianism to uphold the precept of not killing and to practice life-release, thus rejecting all meat from animals. Some people eat vegetarian meals on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month but still crave rich flavors at other times—this is not true vegetarianism.

For those who adopt vegetarianism to abstain from meat, I say: better a virtuous heart than merely virtuous lips—follow the gentleman’s teaching to keep distant from the kitchen. Nurturing qi naturally nourishes the belly; observe the perfected one’s prohibition against strong flavors. Master Zhang addressed two Daoist priests, Renru and Shouru, saying: "All people must cultivate both inner and outer—refine the inner to purity and depth, and outer blessings will follow. Stealing a moment of leisure amid busyness grants a moment of nurturance; reading for a day in stillness brings a day’s benefit. If one only chases outward things, the root is lost, and one grows ever more shallow."

Master Zhang told Zhuo’an: "To preserve the body, focus on calming the heart and nourishing the kidneys. When the heart is calm, the fire of *li* does not flare outward; when the kidneys are nurtured, the water of *kan* does not spill outward. If fire does not flare, the spirit remains unshaken and the heart grows calmer; if water does not spill, there is no leakage of essence, and the kidneys grow clearer. When the kidneys are clear, the fire of life does not surge upward; when the heart is calm, the fire of spirit can shine downward. Spirit and essence congeal and intermingle, forming embryonic breathing—this can ward off illness and prolong life."

On the third day of the third month, the disciples bathed by the banks of the Brocade River, fanned themselves beneath the green woods, and listened to the cuckoos’ calls. Suddenly, a leaf fell to the ground, folded like a letter. Opening it, they found something like *zilan* orchid seeds wrapped inside. Asking a local, they were told: "These are *Duyu* pearls." When asked their use, the reply came: "What use do they have?"

They replied, "We do not know."

Just then, Master Zhang, wearing a bamboo hat, strolled over leisurely and addressed the disciples: "Do you wish to know the story of the *Duyu* pearls? After the King of Shu entered the mountains, his people longed for him, so the king commanded the cuckoo to bestow these pearls upon the people of Shu. The cuckoo was the king’s avian messenger, originally named *Xiebao*. The king said, ‘Go back to our land and console my people.’ Thus, *Xiebao* was also called *Xiebao* (‘repayment’), for King Duyu ordered it to repay the people’s gratitude. The pearls may be red, yellow, green, or purple—no single hue prevails. They can ward off malevolent spirits in households. When encountering such spirits, secretly raise the pearl and cast it toward them, and they will disperse. But none must perceive this; silently recite: ‘King of Shu, King of Shu, pearl’s radiance, pearl’s radiance, cast out the ghost, the ghost departs, slay the ghost, the ghost perishes. I wield the sacred pearl, its rays ever bright. Where yin lingers, it is consumed; when yin is spent, yang returns. By the command of the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Master, swiftly, swiftly, as the law decrees!’

It is also said that the number of pearls can divinely foretell a year’s harvest—whether bountiful or meager.

Master Zhang said: "One should cultivate the body in stillness, act within one’s station, and find contentment in circumstance. Then the heart and nature will be at peace, and the spirit and *qi* will be serene and unperturbed."

Master Zhang spoke of enduring humiliation: "If you teach the young, you must enforce strict discipline. Otherwise, if their nature and temper are corrupted, when they grow older, you will resent them—this is to cherish them only to abandon them."

Master Zhang, accompanied by Yunshi, Zhuo’an, and others, wandered through the wild mountains in the cold of winter when they heard ghostly whispers all around. They inquired of the local earth deity and learned these were the ancestral spirits and paternal souls of the dead. The yin energy was desolate and chilling; graves lay desolate, coffins crumbled, and the clothing, caps, and skeletal remains all suffered the cold’s intrusion. Could one feel no shudder of pity and sorrow? This is why the ancients had the custom of visiting graves and offering winter garments.

Master Zhang told the mountain dwellers: "In summer, one should rise early to practice, then seek a slightly cool place after sunrise to collect the mind in quiet sitting. Never sleep during the scorching midday heat. If sleep does not dull the senses, it may be tolerable, but if it does, essence and fluids transform into sweat and escape—what a pity, what a pity!"

Master Zhang said: "Yesterday, I traveled to Liangjie Mountain and saw an old woman sitting on a cliff, laughing and then weeping. I suspected a fox spirit, but soon she fell from the cliff and died. I hurried forward to look."

The lightning strike had slain it—a thousand-year-old fox spirit. I knew not its deeds, so I asked the Fire Cart Spirit-Official, who replied, "It had eaten humans, hence the strike." If such creatures lurk even in broad daylight on Liangjie Mountain, what might lurk in the depths of remote, desolate cliffs!

Master Zhang sighed and said: "People rush about day and night, always claiming they ‘have no choice.’ But what truly leaves them no choice? Only the mind’s insistence on ‘having no choice’—hence their constant refrain. Yet if one’s present lack of choice must one day cease, then old age and death will surely end it. That is the true cessation—what ‘lack of choice’ remains? Those among you with wisdom and foresight, cease from this day forward."

Master Zhang instructed those treating consumptive illness: "In healing, one must have a tranquil heart, an even heart, a patient heart—never seek swift results. If medicine does not worsen the illness, that is swift enough. Then, one day a slight improvement, two days a slight improvement, three days a gradual improvement—though slow, this is infinitely better than daily decline and imminent death."

Master Zhang, wandering above Yueyun Peak and lodging at the Pavilion of Whispering Winds, addressed his disciples: "Today, the mountains are clear, the people serene, the mind distant, the place secluded—truly a rare scene. Let each of you compose a new poem, then invite Hanxuzi to pluck the zither once more, to stir our poetic spirits. Is this not joyous?

Even if one cannot play the zither, one must learn to listen well, to dispel all turbid desires and muddled delusions. Listening to the zither’s sound is like wandering in the primordial age, where all clamor fades, the mind roams freely, transcending the mundane—cool and virtuous, profound and serene. One feels as though playing the zither oneself, forgetting worldly affairs, meeting Yu and Zhou of old, encountering Confucius and Mencius, with Boya and Ziqi to follow. Such is the refined recluse. Otherwise, one remains but a vulgar, shallow soul—unworthy of shared company!"

Master Zhang loved this autumn’s qi—so pure, so solemn. He mused: "How I long to carry a flask of wine, a zither, a flute, and ascend the highest peak! There, I would laugh and gaze upon the vast earth, rivers, and mountains—mist curling, clouds drifting, sunlight warming the village hamlets, waves rippling on the endless river. Then, the flute’s notes would rise from the treetops, the zither’s sound would issue from the rocks, and the wine’s fragrance would mingle among the crimson springs and jade peaks. Mountain birds would sing, emerald hues would scatter—what bliss! Do any of you share this delight?"

Master Zhang told an elderly Daoist: "At your age, you must settle your heart and ground yourself in practice. Let ‘Leave it be’ govern worldly affairs, and all desires will melt like ice. Every person has apertures within, and within those apertures, vital qi. Without this qi, how could the body be preserved? Yet qi arises constantly, and people fail to observe it in stillness.

Let me offer you eight idle words as your evening drum and morning bell:
*Grasp the aperture, know the moment,
Attend closely, nurture qi.
Then you will think deeply, see through illusions,
Act wisely, and fulfill your destiny.*
This is no deliberate teaching—yet it is precisely what you must study with all your heart.

Stillness is spirit; stability is the mind. Even with apertures, if the mind is not settled within them, how can one perceive the subtle?"

Master Zhang addressed the mountain-dwelling Daoist community: "Huiweng urged people toward the Dao with boundless compassion. Though success may seem distant, this is the shared affliction of millennia of seekers. Yet with soaring resolve, the Dao does not bar the heroic. Fear only weakness and lethargy—with spirit roused, even the patriarchs will silently aid you."

Master Zhang spoke to the mountain recluses: "To be called a recluse in the mountains, one must know the joy of mountain forests. Yet this joy does not lie in the mountains themselves, but in one who delights in them—only then do the mountains enhance that joy. To dwell in harmony with the mountains, in emptiness and stillness, in seclusion and elegance, in simplicity and tranquility—this is to truly know the joy of mountain forests."

Master Zhang said: "To become idle in an instant—that is mastery. To say, ‘Wait, let me set things aside for a few days, then slowly explore’—that is the tongue of the mediocre, the heart of the foolish."

Master Zhang told Yuanyangzi: "If you can sever worldly attachments and withdraw from the red dust, your life’s course is set from this day. Henceforth, you will wander freely, forever secure. What joy! Fine weather, beautiful mountains and waters, pavilions, good friends, splendid scenery—from this day, receive them, savor them, awaken to them."

Master Zhang said: "The geography of immortals must be understood alongside the Dao of alchemy. Take Yuanyangzi’s Yi Yun Mountain Villa, for instance: its dwelling sits between two mountains, neither swallowing nor spewing, now open, now closed. Using the method of reliance and adhesion, it forms a home of peace—truly the Great Central Ultimate below the Yellow Court and above the Pass of Origin. Who else knows such celestial secrets?"

Master Zhang said: "Silent mountains are perfect for discoursing on the supreme Dao; a clear heart loves the scent of fine incense—this is the wondrous scene before us." He casually offered these two lines and asked Yuanyang to continue them.

Master Zhang told the Daoist community: "One must leave home while at home, transcend the worldly while in the world, not cling to affairs, not covet things—only then is one a seed of the Dao. There is no need to be bound by inaction, nor mired in overthinking."

Master Zhang wore a cape of cool lotus leaves, roaming carefree beyond the clouds. One day, he heard the sound of stepping songs emerging from the mist. His disciples listened—it lamented the difficulty of transmitting the great Dao and how the yellow-crowned disciples squandered their days. The song went:

*"Time flies swiftly, yet learning the Dao lags behind.
Amid flowing waters and empty mountains, I walk alone in thought.
I fear only the fleeting scenes before my eyes—
in an instant, my throat’s breath may cease, lost in ignorance.
While alive, lost in ignorance;
upon waking, naught remains but walking corpses of flesh.
I fear most when impermanence arrives—
cold bones, how pitiful!
In that moment of endless rebirth,
one knows not the rain striking the flower branches."*

Master Zhang took up Han Xian’s fisherman’s drum, beating in rhythm to convey the emotion, and sang *The Desolate Song of the Dusty Sea*:

*"Flying Dragon Child, roaming the heavens,
never speaking but of loyalty and filial piety,
journeying always to Penglai’s isles.
Seeking to transmit the Dao, I seek men,
sighing that causes and conditions never align,
lamenting how few in life ever turn back.
A candle in the wind, a boat on the water—
easily snuffed, swiftly swept away.
Who among the gardens of power and profit lasts long?
Even kin and friends may turn to foes.
In a blink, one falls into impermanence’s grasp,
buried beneath overgrown weeds and wild smoke.
Woodcutters pass, trampling the path,
shepherd boys wear down the gravestones.
Ask a rustic whose tomb this is—
a few words, then silence, ghostly weeping, sobbing.
Alas! The crane-riding immortal departs—no return."*

Master Zhang left the Clear and Subtle Heavenly Realm and entered the distant, tranquil mountains, where several disciples boiled spring water in warm hospitality. The Master said: "Today, I playfully gift *The Immortal Song of the Primordial Origin* to Yuanyang. Let all present sing it for me, adding to the tales of forests and springs." At that moment, Li the Mountain Recluse tapped bamboo to summon the tortoise, Yang the Layman struck the wind-summoning zither, and Liu the Rustic beat the drifting-cloud clappers. Then they sang for the Master:

*"Daoist Yuanyang, truly playful,
seeking the Dao, he cast off office like worn sandals.
Eight years without a partner, dreaming of solitary roosts,
night’s chill seeping through iron pillows and cold mandarin-duck quilts.
His temples whitened, yet his years still brim with vitality.
I urge you: seek the Yellow Matchmaker early,
take a lovely wife.
Man below, woman above—reversing Kan and Li,
male as female, harmonizing spirit and qi.
The Heavenly Terrace Immortal’s tender groom,
Old Man Zhang Guo’s beautiful bride.
Beautiful bride, tender groom—
in the bridal chamber, heaven and earth forgotten.
Nature and fate intertwined, lives shared to the eyebrows.
In profound oneness, then you’ll see your true heart;
in hazy indistinction, then you’ll grasp your true intent.
This Daoist sentiment is your first step on the immortal’s ladder.
Laughing, I pass it to you—
Sanfeng Daoist, brush in hand, inscribed."*

As the song ended, they saw the pavilion bathed in white moonlight, the sky beyond the tower a deep blue. Seated in a circle upon the stone altar, they looked at one another and smiled.

**On Poetry**
Master Zhang said: *"The Book of Documents* states: ‘Poetry expresses the will.’ The commentary says: ‘What is in the heart is the will; what is spoken is poetry.’ Thus, the will is the numinous essence within the human heart, and poetry is but the overflow of that numinous essence. Immortals refine this empty, wondrous nature through seven reversals and nine returns, forging the eternal, deathless Valley Spirit. Beyond the light and qi of sun and moon, it takes form; within their radiance, it remains formless. Where the spirit reaches, poetry arises. Though songs and poems differ, the numinous essence varies in each.

I have often wandered the wilds with the immortals, appearing and vanishing amid mist and rosy clouds. Whenever I encountered the sublime verses of the perfected ones, I committed them to heart and set them to brush, compiling them into works like *Leisurely Talks Among Water and Stone*. Lü’s poetry soars with lofty strokes and rings with resonant tones—his roaming verses are beyond compare. Here, I record a few to show how his numinous essence differs from others’."

*Visiting Yueyun Immortal Abbey on the Seventh Night*:
*"Just finished the feast on Mount Gou,
I return to wander this ancient temple.
Sparse wind through the plane-tree courtyard,
fine rain on autumn bean blossoms.
Distant peaks—clouds just gathered;
long sky—mists suddenly withdrawn.
Such coolness tonight—
a jade flute leans against the high tower."*

*Passing the Wuchang City Tower*:
*"Wuchang’s walls and gates stand as before,
the people of Chu dwell near the water’s edge.
Beyond the railing, the great river washes day and night;
within the pavilion, a long sword leans against the clouded sky.
Scholars sit and chant beneath the Southern Tower’s moon;
fishermen sing as they return through Western Ford’s mist.
The old man playing the flute is utterly at leisure—
his bright recitation echoes for a thousand years."*

*Six Quatrains with Han Qingfu Touring Mount Lu*:
*"Beyond the clouds, Lu Mountain’s nine-fold green—
I open the window to face the peaks and read the *Yellow Court*.
Who recognizes the scenery within?
I cast the scroll aside and step into the emerald screen."*

*"After rain, fresh reeds greenly soak the man;
I hasten deep into the path to escape the red dust.
Han’s reed pipe and Lü’s flute—both pass together,
one immortal sound, two transformed bodies."*

*"Where is there no joy? Where is joy not found?
On earth, carefree as in heaven.
A waterfall cascades three hundred feet upward—
in an instant, pure qi fills the cliffs."*

*"Words flow freely, brushstrokes follow—
I scrape away moss, green at varying heights.
Suddenly, the sound of a Buddhist drum drifts from the mist—
verdant woods, past Tiger Creek."*

*"A one-character poem, a one-character flight—
a yellow crane at the sky’s edge carries me home.
Before the altar, guests struggle to detain me—
my heart like idle clouds, a man of the emerald haze."*

*"Awakening the slumbering dragon at the sea gate,
in a moment, rain pours from the sky’s edge.
A long sword flies away once more—
I watch the southeast, where the trees’ shadows darken."*

All are clear and lovely. Among those whose numinous essence approaches Huiweng’s, none surpasses Master Han Qingfu. His *Idle Chant* reads:
*"Silently holding a stringless zither,
gently blowing a holeless flute."*

---

*"One pluck and heaven and earth grow clear,
one breath and heaven and earth expand.
One breath, then one pluck again—
all are songs of immortals."*

His *Matching Lü Dongbin* reads:
*"Tigers at the gate, cranes in the hut,
jade pipes winding, flutes like Xiangru’s.
I come not as a wanderer of clouded peaks—
the flowing waters of the Xiang write their twists in song."*

All his words are bold and vast.

Lan Caihe styled himself Master of the Long Whistle. His quatrain *Answering a Query on His Immortal Abode* says:
*"Singing his song to the end, he ascends,
the ancient Master of Mount Yue’s long whistle.
Ask where I dwell these days—
in heaven’s jade capital, where immortals reside."*

Once, I saw the linked verses *Treading Songs in Guanzhong* by Han, Lan, Cao, and He:
*"Vast as a jade flask, the cosmos spins,
a lone man taps the clappers, idly chanting.
Spring in Chang’an fades with wind and rain,
fallen blossoms carpet the earth as he strolls at ease."*

Truly, they capture the joy of carefree companionship, one chant echoing thrice in delight.

Kunlun Magu styled herself the Jade City Immortal. Her poetry excels in rich resonance. Her *Three Quatrains on Yueyun Altar* read:
*"Riding phoenix and simurgh down from the jade city,
she smiles at the moon’s clear light beyond the clouds.
Ten thousand miles of Kunlun, the sky’s winds carry her—
jade pendants and pearl girdles chime as she sways."*

*"Treading blue clouds, she crosses seas and mountains,
a jade flute in hand, her mind at ease.
From the clouds emerges a golden rosy cloak—
all the way here, she hums a pure tune."*

*"At Yueyun Altar, she seeks Huiweng,
two or three disciples tap the Daoist chime.
Wind’s voice ripples, clouds’ whispers fade—
lamplight glows crimson through the night."*

Her *Three Hymns of Pacing the Void* say:
*"I, a wandering immortal of Kunlun’s daughters,
have watched the seas turn to mulberry fields.
With powers spanning the eight directions, I roam in play—
my pendants’ chime sways at the edge of the azure vault."*

*"Golden blossoms high in my coiled hair,
I bid farewell to the Western Pond and Mother’s home.
Gentle winds of heaven brush my sleeves—
Pacing the Void bows before the purple cloud chariot."*

*"Brewing the wine of long life is no hard task,
for in my palm lies the magic elixir.
I, a daughter of heaven’s immortals,
drunk, share the moon’s palace with Chang’e."*

The Jade City Immortal often studied under the divine Miaogu. One day, master and disciple paced the void, descending upon the brocade river’s banks. The divine being inscribed these words:
*"Behold the river’s tide, its force vast and wild,
stirring the mountain clouds to drift and fade.
Across the river, lanterns flicker in the mist—
a fresh verse flows from the brush’s tip.
Thoughts linger, the window opens to gaze—
this pavilion, how crisp and bright!"*

The Immortal responded in kind:
*"Waters vast, mountains boundless,
before the pavilion, they surge and swell.
After rain, frogs’ drums clamor in the hall,
the tide’s roar rises with the moon’s ascent.
From the moon I come, by the clouds I gaze—
the evening breeze carries a cool, refreshing air."*

The Transcendent of Pure Elegance was hailed in the Tang as a master of poetry, his nature ethereal and free. He once descended to the mortal realm. His *Descending at the Double Clarity Pavilion on the Xiuxi Festival* reads:

*"I read through a thousand ages of books,
sword in hand, I sought the lords’ favor.
Trifles displeased me—
drunk, I hid in the wine-mound’s depths.
The Yellow Emperor’s era was not far,
Qin and Han passed like a rushing stream.
The affairs before my eyes, fleeting—
all dissolved without a care.
An old man, chanting as he walks the mountains,
deeply fond of Xie Xuan’s tower.
A hundred thousand poems I’ve written,
entrusting them to heaven and earth to keep.
I have my own true master within—
vast and boundless, I return to Yingzhou.
Today, discussing the Xiuxi rites,
all fades into a single cup.
Sea immortals send a summons,
riding the wind past ten continents.
Eastward, three divine beings,
a host of transcendents roam together.
A single draught of five thousand measures—
my belly swells with a river of words.
In the land of Nothing-Whatever,
I let out a long whistle and depart for the sea’s edge."*

His *Song of the Grotto-Heaven* declares:

*"Seeking the elixir among sea and mountains,
yet the elixir is not found in sea or mountain.
Heaven and earth wield the bellows’ key,
but the bellows are not the cosmos’ forge.
The golden pill was ever my own possession—
immortals must be forged from heroes.
Last night, drinking before the Queen Mother,
I heard the cloud-borne peaches have ripened.
Li Taibai’s long whistle, Anqi’s song—
none among the assembled immortals can match me!
I shall ride a horned dragon through the six directions,
the void so vast, no trace of snow remains.
A great wind blows from the north,
parting the layered cold clouds.
Oh, to have wine like rain,
drawn endlessly from the sky!
Oh, to have wine like a spring,
drinking it seated, eyes turned heavenward!
Wildly chanting, clapping hands, shoulders squared—
who am I? Li Qinglian!"*

Master Dongpo, a transcendent talent, stood shoulder to shoulder with Taibai, riding the wind and whistling to the moon, his spirit everlasting. His *Farewell to Autumn in Jiangnan* reads:

*"Fragments of autumn clouds drift far,
boundless autumn waters swell.
Beyond green mountains and crimson trees,
wild geese stretch toward distant passes.
North of Jibei, the cold grows sharper,
while Jiangnan’s air turns mild.
The Little Spring has just arrived—
welcoming and sending off, both pass in turn!"*

His *Inscription on Han Qingfu’s Portrait* states:

*"A courtier in the Hall of Fragrance,
born of the Ministry’s lineage.
A heart at leisure, forgetting wealth and rank,
from youth, drawn to mist and rosy clouds.
Planting the fruit of immortality in his bowl,
cultivating undying flowers in his garden.
The Eight Immortals share his longevity,
through ten thousand kalpas, he clutches cinnabar.
His head bows to the horse at Blue Pass,
his breast holds the crimson fire-crow.
Through a thousand autumns, uncle and nephew stand as sages—
Confucian and Daoist paths, both boundless."*

His *Self-Inscription on a Painting of Bamboo Hat and Straw Shoes* proclaims:

*"The mountain man’s old ways are those of a madcap—
drunk, he sketches a field-dweller’s hat and sandals.
Fine lines sometimes serve as paintings,
a carefree heart never parts from its winepot.
At the tower’s top, admiring the moon, he invites Chan monks;
at the valley’s mouth, braving the mist, he visits anglers.
Coming and going as he pleases, at ease—
a single long whistle, he vanishes into the forest’s depths."*

His *Passing East Peak* observes:

*"Long absent from East Peak,
the rivers and mountains remain as before.
Fallen plantains litter the ground—
the snow’s intent invites Chan contemplation."*

His *Impromptu Verses at Lake’s Mouth* include:

*"Wisps of mist, rippling waves,
beyond the pavilion on the water, painted boats abound.
Whose jade flute sounds across ten leagues?
I hear Hong’er’s singing as the oars rest."*

*"Wind slants, rain fine, the kudzu robe light,
two or three silver knives gleam above the water.
I love the unbroken fragrance of water caltrops and lotuses—
someone walks deep among the bamboo west of the stream."*

His *Ode to the Rain that Sharpens Swords* laments:

*"Jingzhou drenched in rain like balm,
all to temper the hero’s precious blade.
Most of all, the waters beneath Wuchang’s walls—
through a thousand autumns, they roar and surge like thunderous waves."*

His *Ode to the White Radish* quips:

*"Clearer than snow-water, whiter than frost,
in the old garden’s winter chill, its fragrance lingers.
I laugh at the mountain monks, ever vegetarian—
cooked with lard, they still cannot taste it!"*

His *Self-Gift* declares:

*"Never in my life have I knit my brows in worry—
today, Dongpo becomes a carefree immortal.
Resolved to leave traces in rivers and mountains,
I shall hang my name forever in mist and clouds."*

His six-line *Visiting the Heart-Mind Mountain Lodge of Pure Dao* muses:

*"Qi keen, spirit clear, the Dao abides,
mountains empty, people still, the zither’s notes profound.
A single mat wreathed in tea smoke,
three parts of wine’s lingering intent."*

His *A Few Words* lyric sings:

*"Cool shade winds,
winds through fallen blossoms,
beyond the window, birdsong faint.
Birdsong faint,
a single stalk of bamboo slants just so.
Emerald feathers trill through the dawn—
I’ve just awakened from a brief slumber."*

Such limpid, delicate brushwork, undiminished in its transcendent spirit—only a true immortal could achieve it.

Shao Yaofu was a Confucian immortal. Once, he manifested before Shi Cai, composing *Chanting the Yijing*:

*"Fu Xi, great sage,
drew the trigrams, passing them through the ages.
The mechanism of yin and yang’s transformations—
heaven and earth are the ancestors of the Changes.
I dwell in the Nest of Peace and Joy,
heaven and earth my companions.
Piercing the hearts of sages and worthies,
I find contentment in tranquility and ease."*

Vast and boundless, had it been placed in the *Striking the Earth* collection, it would still stand apart.

Bai Yuchan was a transcendent talent of the Daoist school, leaving behind many inscriptions on steles in famous mountains. Whenever he encountered lofty recluses, he would gift them with poems. His *Inscription on the Hall of Ease* reads:

*"Wind sighs through the forest,
bamboo crowds the window.
Rare to find a man of pure heart—
together, we speak of a new autumn evening.
Wine in hand, drunk in the thatched hall,
incense burning as we read the *Zhouyi*.
Qiong Mountain’s immortal arrives here—
host and guest, our joy knows no bounds."*

His *Presented to the Mountain Man of Yuanyang* advises:

*"Returning to the mountains, hidden from the world, you speak of long life,
day by day, wandering with the idle clouds at will.
Everywhere, turning the light inward to reflect,
each dawn, facing the scene, you must forget emotion.
Sweeping away the dust of labored dreams,
inscribing your name in heaven and earth, scattering the traveler’s fame.
Do not say the seclusion’s alchemy is bitter—
roaming the void, your heart is naturally empty and clear."*

Zhang Ziqiong of Raozhou attained the Dao in the early Yuan. His poetry brims with vigor and grace.

**“Self-Presentation” in Six-Character Lines** reads:
*"The heart like a bell’s toll on a snowy night,
the bearing akin to plum blossoms in frosty skies.
Wandering deep where white clouds drift—
who knows the immortal’s boundless ease?"*

**“Ode to Embryonic Breathing”** says:
*"Neither forced nor forgotten, the wondrous in-breath and out,
cultivation lies in mastering this art.
Harmonizing the two qi to birth embryonic breath,
then within its midst set the crucible and furnace."*

Qiu Changchun’s **“Autumn Crossing Yueyun Tower”** goes:
*"The vast sky’s wind fills the tower,
clouds surge from peaks into wooded hills.
Where rain’s murmur mingles with eaves bells,
a single courtyard in the abbot’s quarters—pure autumn."*

His verse brims with a lofty, untrammeled spirit.

Zhang Ziyang’s **“Self-Congratulation on Longevity”** poem declares:
*"The sea’s tally spans ten thousand ages of fleeting time,
eight hundred springs since attaining the Dao.
Parting with a child who rides a crane away,
the void shatters to reveal the whole self."*

None but the highest immortals could compose such lines.

The Elder of Serenity, primordial qi undivided, has a **five-character quatrain in “Answering a Question on His Surname”**:
*"One qi sifts past and present,
yin and yang’s wondrous transformations.
Ask my name and surname—
a sleeping lout, old Serenity."*

My master, the Fire Dragon, cared little for poetry, being indifferent to fame. Here is one of his **occasional quatrains** I recall:
*"By chance my Daoist name matches Zheng Huolong,
my true name hidden in the Great Void.
Since delivering Sanfeng across,
I’ve returned east of Penglai’s Weak Waters."*

The Flying Rosy Mist Immortal was my tenth-generation disciple, having consumed divine elixirs to soar through the skies. She once descended upon the Purple Cloud Abbey in Yunnan, leaving behind a quatrain before departing with only "Flying Rosy Mist" as her signature. The poem reads:
*"Long dwelt I in Jasper Pool’s jade towers green,
then rode a rainbow crane to sacred peaks unseen.
Should mortals ask my surname, Flying Rosy Mist—
once held I golden elixirs, serving the Bathed Marquis."*

Lu Qianxu, a native of Huaidong, attained the Dao under the guidance of Patriarch Lü during the Jiajing era. His prolific writings include *The Primordial Survey of the Laozi* in two fascicles, *Probing Annotations on the Yin Fu Jing* in one fascicle, *Probing Annotations on the Cantong Qi* in one fascicle, *The Rectified Treatise on the Golden Elixir* in one fascicle, *Probing Annotations on the Four Hundred Words of Master Ziyang* in one fascicle, *The Outer History of the Square Flask* in eight fascicles, and *The Nanhua Supplementary Ink* in eight fascicles.

Recently, among our fellow disciples, there is one known as Master Baibai, who annotated the *Daodejing* under the title *The Eastern Advent’s Orthodox Justice*. Qianxu inscribed a poem for him:
*"One commentary unveils the Dao’s profoundest gate,
once more purple qi arrives from the eastern state.
Zither plucked, flute played—true scholar’s art,
expounding dharma, debating sutras—peerless eloquent heart.
I sit in the Square Flask, gazing at the azure sea,
while you ascend Round Peak, Penglai’s heights to see."*

This morning we sat together in the riverside pavilion,
reciting the *Nanhua* and laughing at our own folly."

This is because Master Baibai also composed works such as *The Outer History of Round Peak*, *Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures*, and *Miscellaneous Explications on the *Awakening to Reality* and the *Triplex Unity***. As for planchette divination—someone asked—is not the art of tracing characters in sand a minor craft? Yet its devotees swarm, its proponents clamor, and its techniques flourish. From whence does this practice truly originate? Is it entirely trustworthy? Or not?

Master Zhang replied: Long ago, Master Hui desired to elucidate this mystery for Han San and the others but ultimately left the explanation unfinished. Today, I shall make it clear.

The character *jī* (乩) means "to examine" (稽), that is, to investigate and verify. As the *Shuowen* states: "Divination is used to resolve doubts." Thus, its radical derives from *zhān* (占, "to divine"), while its phonetic component is *yǐn* (乚), an ancient form of *yǐn* (隐, "to conceal"). The *Erya* glosses *yǐn* as "to divine" (占), with the commentary explaining: "*Yǐn* means 'to assess.'" The subcommentary adds: "Diviners observe omens to determine fortune or misfortune, but they must first assess and deliberate." Yet if the diviner’s words still require assessment, they differ not at all from undivined speech—so why divine at all? There is, however, a deeper principle at work.

Celestial immortals and earthbound transcendents dislike discussing fortune and misfortune; they only urge people to cultivate themselves and await their fate. Thus, when they speak of moral instruction or the elixir path, they conceal nothing. Even when prescribing remedies to save lives, they remain forthright. But for all other matters—such as inquiries into fortune or failure—they invariably conceal their meaning. This concealment is merely a pretext to avoid answering. For if they explicitly foretold fortune or misfortune, those destined for blessings might grow arrogant and turn fortune into calamity, while those fated for misfortune might become paralyzed by fear and, in dreading disaster, invite it prematurely. How can fortune be summoned? Only through virtuous deeds may auspiciousness descend.

Their veiled language suggests that the truth is self-evident without words, yet the purpose of concealment extends further. After achieving the Dao, immortals leave no shadow when treading the sun and moon, make no sound when passing through metal and stone—ordinary people cannot perceive them. Thus, in planchette divination, they inscribe serpentine characters in the sand, their words myriad in form, to demonstrate their indestructibility.

Yet planchette divination is a borrowed technique. Since ancient times, true adepts have condemned it as the practice of mere thaumaturges. Why, then, do immortals now descend to wield the stylus? Because in recent times, this art has become fashionable, and nobles and commoners alike believe in and favor it. Immortals, whose urgent task is to enlighten and awaken the world, thus employ the planchette to subtly guide all under heaven—turning the false into the real.

Those who study planchette divination fall into two categories: one succeeds, the other fails. The superior type prevails through virtue, sincerity, and karmic affinity. Even if they lack skill in divination, immortals still wish to deliver them—how much more so if they understand the art? The immortals seize the opportunity to guide them, dispensing with talismans and incantations, and high transcendents naturally descend into their chambers.

The inferior type fails through malice, deceit, and greed. Even if they excel in divination, immortals will not approach them—how much less if they act with irreverence? The immortals toy with them through the planchette, recklessly employing talismans and spells, thereby inviting ghosts into their chambers instead.

Since we have leapt beyond the Five Phases, neither heaven nor earth can constrain us, nor yin and yang mold us. Even if we wished to summon them, we would do so with reverence—what need have we for talismans and incantations? Ah! This is why thaumaturges deceive the foolish and why immortals despise thaumaturges.

Today, I speak of the planchette through the planchette itself, and this shall serve as its instruction.

Someone asked further: If the proper way to invoke the planchette lies in virtue, sincerity, and karmic affinity—not in talismans and incantations—then why does the Southern Palace school of immortals employ talismans and incantations to command spirits?

Master Zhang replied: Though the Southern Palace lineage employs talismans and incantations, these are transmitted by high transcendents to aid the world in averting calamities and dispelling harm. Such esoteric scriptures are not found in the mundane world of woodblocks and printing. Even if one obtains them, they must be used with a heart devoted to benefiting others to achieve profound merit. Should one employ them selfishly, the Heavenly Emperor will strike them down with thunderbolts, extinguishing their lives and revoking their arts.

Thus, even the Southern Palace’s talismans and incantations require reverence and sincerity to be efficacious. How can the vulgar planchette’s talismans and incantations compare? Much less when coupled with irreverence and insincerity! Herein, disciples, you may attain clarity.

Master Zhang said: Heaven originally harbors no intent to bless the good or curse the wicked. Auspiciousness and calamity are self-invited; if Heaven did intend to bless the good and punish the wicked, then auspiciousness and calamity would be self-evident. It is an inevitable principle that those who habitually do good will receive blessings—even if misfortune befalls them, it will be fleeting. It is an inevitable truth that those who habitually do evil will incur misfortune—even if fortune smiles upon them, it will be brief. Why seek answers outside oneself?

Yet I observe the benighted masses: when praying to gods, they seek divination slips and consult hexagrams; when supplicating immortals, they invoke the planchette and trace characters in the sand, as if gods and immortals must know their fortune or misfortune. Later, if the divination proves accurate, they believe; if not, they doubt. Their doubt and belief alike reveal the same old folly.

To be sure, gods and immortals know fortune and misfortune, but why would they reiterate what the human heart already understands? Those whose divinations prove accurate do so for a reason: the good inquire about blessings, and blessings arrive; the wicked fear misfortune, and misfortune descends. It seems to align with their expectations, yet this is not the efficacy of divination slips, hexagrams, the planchette, or sand-tracing. Those whose divinations fail also do so for a reason: the good inquire about misfortune, but no misfortune can befall them; the wicked seek blessings, but no blessings can be granted. It seems to contradict their expectations, yet this is not the inefficacy of divination slips, hexagrams, the planchette, or sand-tracing.

All divination by tortoise shell, milfoil, calculation, and numerology in the world is but this—why can one not know it for oneself? Throughout my life, I have never favored people seeking divination slips, consulting hexagrams, invoking the planchette, or summoning spirits through sand-tracing. I only wish that each person would cultivate virtue and constantly engage in introspection.

Master Zhang said: The immortals possess the wish to deliver others, and there are those who borrow the planchette’s brush to expound the Dao and discourse on the origin of things. The immortals possess a heart that cherishes others, and there are those who borrow the planchette’s brush to encourage goodness and punish evil. The immortals possess the intent to save others, and there are those who borrow the planchette’s brush to prescribe remedies and administer treatment.

If one speaks of determining fortune and misfortune, then human goodness and wickedness are already at play—this I have made clear in the previous chapter and shall not discuss further. What is truly strange are those in the world who set up the planchette to seek geomantic insights or summon spirits to discern the will of Heaven. These are all remnants of the arts of the fangshi; the celestial deities of the upper realms see through their deceit, and none have escaped Heaven’s punishment.

*Eulogies Through the Ages*
The Wen Emperor of the Yongle Reign, Ming Dynasty

To the True Immortal Zhang Sanfeng,

From the Emperor, with reverence:

I have long admired the True Immortal and yearned to personally receive your guidance. I have previously dispatched envoys bearing incense and letters, journeying to renowned mountains to earnestly invite you. The True Immortal’s virtue and power are lofty, transcending all existence, in harmony with the natural Dao, and wondrous beyond measure. Though my talents are meager and my Dao-cultivation shallow, my sincerity in wishing to meet you has never waned, day or night. With utmost respect, I once again send envoys bearing incense and this letter, humbly entreating your presence. I await your thunder chariot and phoenix carriage, that you may graciously descend and fulfill my earnest longing for your esteemed company.

Respectfully presented.

Additionally, my poem contains the lines: *"I send word to the True Immortal Zhang Youdao, / To say I await you with enduring longing."* This appears in *Records of Marvels Sought*, though the full poem is not included.

**Shu Prince Xianchun**—the eleventh son of the August High Emperor—was enfeoffed in the eleventh year of the Hongwu reign and took his princedom in Chengdu in the twenty-third year. He passed in the final years of the Yongle reign and left behind *The Sworn Garden Collection*.

**Eulogy to Master Zhang Sanfeng**

I recall the springs of Penglai and Langyuan,
Yet before the joyful echoes faded, the seas stirred dust.

The great family’s legacy bears few sons,
Scattered kin and friends—how many remain?
The old man who lost his horse knew it was fortune,
The cowherd immortal admired the Perfected Truth.

My master deeply grasped the Marquis of Liu’s art,
Skilfully nurturing the cinnabar field to preserve the Valley Spirit.

**Invitation to Zhang Sanfeng for a Journey**
Long ago I beheld the *Taiji* Diagram,
Where yin and yang turn and return.
The primordial *qi* rests in *Kun*,
Yet the Heavenly Heart cycles anew.

Our August Emperor donned his martial robes,
While the host of immortals emerged to aid his mandate.
Zhou the Madman painted his barrel,
Cold Harmony blew his reed pipe.
The Zhang clan was especially gifted,
Each bearing a heroic and numinous frame.
On the mountain stood the Iron-Crowned,
From Pingyang came the Golden Foil.
Yet you, Master, were the third among them,
Your lofty virtue even more resplendent.
All others strove for achievement,
But this old man alone remained desireless.
The age of Yao and Shun lives on here,
While Chaofu and Xu You alone find joy.

What method of cultivating the heart do I possess,
That I might receive from you the elixir of extended life?
A journey across ten thousand miles of sea and sky—
Let karmic conditions allow its continuation.

**Xiang Prince Xian of柏**
The twelfth son of the August High Emperor, enfeoffed in the eleventh year of the Hongwu reign and established in his princedom at Jingzhou. The prince was well-versed in Daoist teachings, styled himself *Zixuzi*, and passed in the early years of the Jianwen reign.

**Seeking Zhang Sanfeng’s Former Abode on Mount Taihe**
Profoundly mysterious, spirit immortal,
At dawn you drank from the Nine Crossings’ pure springs,
At dusk you lodged in the purple mists of Nanyan.
Fine mountains endure aeons—how many have passed?
Yet they do not share the world’s ceaseless change.
I come now, but see nothing—only grief remains.

A lone hut stands high atop an ancient pine,
Only an old gibbon reaches out to clasp my arm as I climb.
Zhang the Profound, spirit immortal,
From afar I revere your divine whirlwind soaring beyond the utmost bounds,
Your thatched dragon and towering crane ascending to the azure heavens.

**Ning Prince Quan**
The sixteenth son of the August High Emperor, enfeoffed in the twenty-fourth year of the Hongwu reign, established in his princedom at Daning in the twenty-seventh year, and relocated to Nanchang in the second year of the Yongle reign. Learned and fond of antiquity, he was conversant in both Buddhist and Daoist teachings, aspiring to transcendence. He styled himself *Xian*, akin to the Eight Lords of Huainan.

**Song in Memory of the Recluse Zhang Sanfeng**
Taihe’s recluse, Zhang Sanfeng,
Summoned by imperial decree yet never appearing—truly a hidden dragon.
Aged, he attained the Dao, master of the profound,
Living long and gazing afar like the pine.
Since ancient times, I have known no immortal—
Only you could follow in the soaring footsteps.
I have not seen the high one’s visage beyond the world,
Leaving my heart and nature sealed like dust.

Mount Lu’s peaks are veiled in clouds,
Mists and rosy hues fill my breast all day.
Master, come and teach me,
I wish to follow your iron staff into the jade peaks.
Alas!
The one I long for is not seen,
The waters are weak, Penglai’s mountains lie ten thousand leagues away.

**Shu Prince Ding Yougai**
Grandson of Prince Xian of Shu, posthumously honored as the Filial and Solemn Heir Apparent. Diligent in study, principled in conduct, skilled in poetry and *fu*, adept in cursive script. He authored *The Garden of Stability*, in ten fascicles.

**Inscribed at Xuantian Abbey, Recalling Master Sanfeng**
Blissful land, gladly revisited,
Ascending and gazing—what joy!

The Penglai Isles link to the sea-girt isles,
Cloud-washed grottoes stand apart from dust.
Feathered guests mount simurghs and depart,
Immortals return borne on phoenix wings.
They speak of the profound, sitting at leisure long,
Yet linger in hesitation when they would go.

**Shu Prince Hui Shenjian**
Grandson of Prince Xian of Shu’s great-grandson, author of *The Garden of Benevolence*.

**In Praise of the Portrait of Master Sanfeng**
There is a man—
Beyond the world, no common being.
Once from the Central Land,
He moved his dwelling to the northern wilds.
His extraordinary bones stand like a forest,
His fine beard bristles like halberds.
Not far from the age of Chongyang,
He follows the fragrant steps of Xu Jing.
How ethereal, the qi of the immortals!
How pristine, his heart like ice and snow!
Eager to seek a master and inquire of the Dao,
The years and months pass in haste.
Having received the secret from the Scattered Sage,
He again continued the lineage of Melon King.
He grasped the wondrous principle of preserving the One True,
And merged with the undivided purity of Yang.
South he wandered through Min and Chu,
East he ranged to Fusang.
Through the grotto-heavens of all the realms he passed,
Among transformed beings he soared.
Confucian, Buddhist, Laozi, Zhuangzi—
All their profound mysteries he penetrated,
Holding jade within, his treasure concealed.
In long sashes and short hemp robes,
He came to our land.
I know not how many years his age spans,
But only see his hair grown hoary.
Long has he followed the company of Red Pine,
Resembling the youth of Boyi on the ruined wall.

**Hu Ying**
Hu Ying, styled Yuanjie, a native of Wujin. In the second year of Jianwen, he served as Minister of Rites and was posthumously honored as Loyal and Peaceful.

**Visiting Master Zhang Sanfeng at Xiangfu Temple, Not Finding Him**
Long have I cherished friendship, yet parted from the crowd,
Alone in the mountains I pay homage to the white clouds.
Dragons bring rain to detain the guest,
Deer bear flowers to share with the monks.
Sparse stars emerge from bamboo at dusk,
Flowing water murmurs in the quiet night.
I recall the old friend who hid himself here—
Who now composes poems like Bao Canjun?

**Shen Yuanxiu**
Yuanxiu, also named Xiu, styled Wansan, sobriquet Sanshan. A man of southern China in the early Ming, his deeds are detailed in his collected works. According to the *Yuanjian Leihan*, Shen was also named Fu, styled Zhongying, and was the third son, hence the people of Wu called him Wansan. He was the wealthiest family in Jiangnan. He had two sons: Mao and Wang. When the Taizu Emperor established his capital at Jinling, he summoned Shen to court and ordered him to present a thousand ingots of silver and a hundred catties of gold annually. Horses, armor, grain, and funds were often drawn from Mao. Later, Mao was convicted of an offense and sent to Liaoyang for military service, where he dug into the earth and found golden oxen and horses, numbering in the thousands. **Refining the Elixir, Remembering Master Sanfeng**

The Patriarch transmitted to me boundless arts,
Forging the tripod, refining the elixir—crimson flames glow.
Eight hundred fire-oxen plow the moonlit night,
Three thousand beauties laugh in the spring breeze.
Golden sprouts gleam, first filling the cauldron,
White snow swirls, filling the sky.
The divine talisman atop the head is not yet ready to consume—
Nine cycles must complete the profound work.

**Again**
Deep thanks to my master for loving Wansan,
When shall we meet again in the southwest?
Heavy and turbid, yellow gold is but for almsgiving,
Light and pure, white jade holds the wondrous mystery.
At the hundred-foot pole’s tip, one must advance further,
The theme of a thousand autumns is the cultivation of immortality.
The earth’s primordial secret methods are inexhaustible—
I still seek the divine elixir, awaiting the Patriarch’s transmission.

**Inscribed on the Wall of Chaoyang Temple**
The old fisherman of Qinhuai,
With his boat as home, drifts like tumbleweed.
Since the true master transmitted the Dao,
He mounted a simurgh and flew into the sea and sky.

**Zha Shenxing**
At Fushan, the Ritual Terrace for Master Zhang Sanfeng still stands.
A clear pool reflects the shadows of trees, their branches sparse.
Before the pavilion lies the Bathing Envoy’s Pool and the Longevity Cassia.
By day, the corridors are quiet, the emptiness evoking the pacing of immortals.
After the world’s visitors depart and the chess game ends,
Clouds drift lightly from the mountain, rain clears at dawn.
Amidst the rolling dust of the mortal world, the lone pavilion remains,
After a hundred battles in the vast kalpa.
The crane returning to the marble pillar should shed tears—
Half the old city walls are now mounds of ruins.

**Wang Xiling**
Styled Mengjiu, sobriquet Yuantong. His affairs are recorded in his collected works.

**On the Boat at West Lake, Moved by Master Feilong’s Descent to Teach the Art of Guiding the Spirit**
Composing verses on the spot, I command my son Simin to record them.

Iron pillar in the fire, heroic bones,
Plum blossoms in the snow, the heart of a Daoist.
The iceberg looms, pressing down on the sky (referring to a certain governor),
Misty waters fill the lake as I chant idly.
I shall join the northern suburbs to watch the rising mist,
Too lazy to chant of the eastern lands’ submersion.
All thanks to the master’s clear guidance,
Even the sickly Lord Liu rests in peace.

**Chen Zheng**
Styled Qizhi, a great merchant of Qinhuai, who styled himself the Recluse of the Huai River.

**On Reading the “Biographies of Eccentrics” in the *History of Ming***
For ten years, the Cheng Emperor was not seen—
Such lofty purity is rarely found.
The *Mingwen* mistakenly swept away the *Biographies of Eccentrics*—
Who knew that on Mount Taihua dwelt the reclusive Xi Yi!

**Qian Chengqun**
Styled Jizhai, a native of Jiaxing County, Zhejiang. In the sixtieth year of Kangxi, he passed the imperial examination, served as Vice Minister of Justice, was promoted to Minister, and retired to his fields. He was posthumously honored as Cultured and Upright. He authored *The Fragrant Tree Studio Poetry Collection*.

**Respectfully Harmonizing**

**Imperial Composition on the Ninth Day of the First Month at Wangxinzhuang, Viewing Lanterns to Yuan Rhymes**

The farmer’s spring wine is rich and strong,
Just in time to welcome the imperial carriage—qi grows harmonious.
The village drum for the earth god joins the drum for prayers,
The wind at Lantern-Falling follows the wind at Lantern-Testing.
Immortals bring the ragged Daoist down from the empty azure—
Zhang Lata and Qiu Chuji both sought the Dao and ascended as immortals.
People stand by swings singing of crimson.
The village’s Mao Chang poetic lineage remains,
Yet whose traces today could match mine?
When I oversaw education in the capital region,
I once lectured on the Dao and discussed poetry here with scholars on a snowy night.

**Zhao Yi**
Styled Yunshu, sobriquet Oubei, also called Oubai, a native of Yanghu.
In the twenty-sixth year of Qianlong, he placed third in the palace examination and rose to the post of Guizhou-Xi Circuit Intendant.

**Li Dou Pavilion at Zhang Sanfeng’s Ritual Platform in Pingyue’s Gaozhen Temple**

The ancient temple of Gaozhen stands lush and verdant,
Still speaking of the immortal elder’s star-ward seals.
No trace remains of the stone-pillar crane,
Yet the name once drew the dragon of Dinghu—
Hu Ying sought Sanfeng, and sought the Jianwen Emperor as well.
Deep in the mountains, cinnabar grains may yet drift,
While the aged think only of keeping company with the Red Pine.
I have retired in leisure, hoping to study the Dao—
Perhaps on the road ahead, we may yet meet.

**Li Diaoyuan**
Sobriquet Yucun, a native of Mianzhou.
In the Qianlong *guiwei* year, he placed second in the palace examination, entered the Hanlin Academy, oversaw education in Guangdong, and served as Director of the Grand Canal.

**At Xiangfu Temple, Reading the Ming Poem Stele of Hu Ying’s Search for Zhang Sanfeng, Harmonizing Its Rhymes with a Preface**

East of the temple hall stands a stele carved in the ninth year of Jiajing by Wang Rubin, bearing the poem of Hu Ying, Minister of Rites, from the fourth year of Chenghua. According to the *Ming Annals*, in the fifth year of Yongle (a *dinghai* year), Hu Ying, a Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Revenue, was dispatched with Daoists to travel the realm in search of the immortal Zhang Sanfeng. He returned only after ten years. Some say he was also searching for the Jianwen Emperor. The stele’s dating to “the fourth year of Chenghua” and the title “Minister of Rites” are both errors.

Hu’s poetic thought was truly transcendent—
Who knew the purple clouds were his aura?
Not in Wu’s capital to gaze upon the sun’s light,
But in Shu’s land to recognize the stars’ divisions.
After the Heavenly Master’s departure, spirits guarded,
When the Daoist arrived, ghosts wailed.
Yongle’s reign—who mistook it for Chenghua?
Inscribing the stele, I laugh at Zhang Wujun’s folly.

**Excerpt from “Accompanying Chen Guangwen with Wine on a Second Visit to Thatched Hall”**

Where could one carry a wine vessel?
Only to Thatched Hall Temple.
At dawn, I kept my promise to stay the night,
And the gentlemen arrived in swift succession.
A narrow path led through secluded bamboo,
Its twists revealing fine charm.
The portrait stood in the central hall,
And I paid homage to two steles.
One was carved by the He family,
A rare block kept in their private collection.
The smaller stele bore
The mark of Prefect Ding.
Several more tablets stood tall,
Their brushstrokes making dragons and serpents flee.
Amid the grass, Tang poems floated,
Their characters dazzling like talismanic script.
Sanfeng or Shanfeng—
Who could resolve their sameness or difference?
Even the white-haired monk
Pounded his mortar all day.
Did not Du Fu say,
“Literature is a matter for all ages”?
*Note: The stele inscription writes “Shanfeng” for “Sanfeng.”
My humble opinion: This stele must have been inscribed before the name was changed.*

**Zhang Wen’an**
Styled Jimen, a native of Suining.

A *xiaolian* serving as instructor for the imperial examination, he took up his post at the school. He composed *The Pig-and-White Poetry Manuscript*. After visiting the Thatched Cottage, he proceeded to Green Ram Palace, then to Two Immortals Hermitage, and returned to drink at Gengtang Studio, where he wrote of these events:

An outing led toward the Thatched Cottage,
The path winding to Green Ram Palace.
Laozi glanced at me and smiled faintly—
His celestial countenance truly dragon-like.
The divine ram stood proudly, horns sharp,
Brought from the capital by my late father.
Prayers here grant sturdy limbs,
Each visitor rubbing the bronze in turn.
Behind the courtyard, bamboo soared skyward,
Ten thousand stems sheltering a single shrine—
*(several lines omitted for their vigor)*
The temple’s neighbor boasted fine courtyards,
The Two Immortals’ shrine shaded by thick osmanthus.
The path was too distant for clogs,
So arm in arm, we leapt the wall.
Golden fish, half a foot long, played in the shallow pool,
A few flowered dogs startled the quiet thickets.
Facing the gate, a great wall held a horizontal stone,
Its coiled dragons seething with radiant power.
As if clamped in the mouth, fingers traced the belly—
Who was the scribe? Zhang Sanfeng.
Returning, we spoke of these wonders,
Wine and dishes arrayed beneath twin red lamps.

**Zhang Ruixuan**
Styled Jiwu, sobriquet Fengzhou.

From provincial graduate to metropolitan examination top scholar, he served as Instructor of Huayang in Chengdu and Professor of Kuizhou Prefecture. Upon retirement, he returned to Jiazhou, styling himself the Old Man of Lingyun and, alternatively, the Half-One Recluse—yearning for wholeness. His writings include *The Yi Shuang Xuan Collection*. Sanfeng’s inked calligraphy of Meng Haoran’s five-line verse *“Spring slumber unaware of dawn”* adorns the wall of Gaoyuan Hall:

Falling blossoms and singing birds delight a lifetime,
Immortal traces all praise the brush’s clarity.
Wind and rain cannot erode the ink atop the mountain,
Dragons and serpents seem to coil round the hall’s pillars.
In those years, heaven sought him in vain,
Yet this place’s lofty mark has long borne renown.
Who now shields the green gauze o’er the hall?
Purple qi swirls through the luminous towers.

**Dong Chengxi**
Styled Baoguang, sobriquet Huyuan, a native of Dianjiang. A *jinshi* of the twenty-second year of the Jiaqing reign, he was appointed Bachelor of the Hanlin Academy, then served as Magistrate of Qingtian County in Zhejiang and Professor of Jiading Prefecture.

**Flower Morning Excursion to Gaobiao Mountain**

The towering pavilion looms over the city gates,
Countless mountain hues dazzle the eye anew.

Since the immortal’s wondrous ink first lingered here,
How many springs have passed with birds’ songs and falling flowers!

**Li Jiaxiu**
Jiaxiu, originally named Jia, styled Xilai, sobriquet Dun Sou, also known as Pian Sanren. In the Jiaqing reign’s *wuyin* year, he ranked first in the provincial examination; in the *jimao* year, he passed the metropolitan examination and was appointed Secretary of the Grand Secretariat. Later, he served as Professor of Baoning Prefecture before retiring to Jiazhou.

**Reflections at Golden Terrace Temple, Baoji**

Dust of travel brushed away, I ascend the jade-green peak,
Within Golden Terrace Temple, I pay homage to the Golden Immortal.
Two imperial edicts from former dynasties still carved in stone,
Across the river, three towering peaks pierce the distant sky.
Half a furnace refines sun and moon into elixir,
A single rattan staff plants itself amid clouds and mist.
Who knows where he soared on his crane?
Surely he roams without reckoning the years.

**Again**

Seven years as a Secretary, yet my career bore no fruit,
On my homeward journey, fortune favored me to meet the Master.
Late spring stirs, nearly waking from the millet dream,
The ancient cave feels like a visit to the Jade Capital.
Even the Son of Heaven could scarce behold his Daoist visage,
Why should a petty official weary himself in the dust of travel?
At dusk descending the mountain, I turn back again and again,
Vaguely seeing a flying dragon ascend to the Great Clarity.

**Zhang Qixiang**
Styled Songting, a native of Leshan County, a student of the Imperial Academy.

**Reflections at Three Abundances Pavilion**

Once I read the *Biographies of Eccentrics* in the *History of Ming*,
Master Feng’s immortal traces brim with marvels.
Unadorned, he followed nature’s course,
A single robe and straw cloak unchanged through the years.
His wanderings briefly lodged him at Golden Terrace,
Where he declared his intent to shed the dust of the world.
The coffin’s lid creaked open—he revived,
Leisurely and content, he came to western Shu.
Before him, no Hongwu; after him, no Yongle.
Why then did he alone seek audience with the Prince of Shu?
The scholar’s rare encounter added luster—
Hongwu called the Prince “Scholar of Shu.”
The two immortals’ temple walls preserve his wondrous ink,
Dragons and serpents writhe, capturing his spirited likeness.
A pure breeze blows into Hanjia,
At High Mark, he cast his brush—how extraordinary!
He played in the mortal realm, now hidden, now revealed,
Like a divine dragon, head and tail never fully seen!
Moreover, he traveled over a thousand *li* a day—
Who could pursue him to inquire after his well-being?
The Grand Secretary Hu, the Eunuch Zhu,
Vainly bore imperial seals and incense,
Searching the wild frontiers, yet never found him.
Little did they know the immortal’s traces lingered everywhere,
Scholars and officials revered him, delighting in his reclusive cultivation.
Approachable and affable, he often met with people,
Never summoned to the imperial hall to sit in the honored seat.
To this day, his portrait remains solemn in the pavilion,
Large ears, round eyes, a full jaw.
His beard bristles like halberds, his spirit like a mirror,
Responding to all who pray with voices in harmony.
I offer a heart of incense before the ancestral altar—
When shall I point to the Dao’s origin!

**Wang Yun**
Styled Zhusun, a native of Leshan County.

**Stone Carving of Zhang Sanfeng’s Self-Portrait at Fuquan Mountain**

Daoist grace and immortal bone emerge in the painting,
His fly-whisk sways, his bearing pure.
Tea bowl and incense burner ever at his side,
Three flowers crown his head—thus the Master’s appearance.

**Dong Jiang**
Styled Xingfan, sobriquet Xifan Layman, a native of Dianjiang. Xingfan excelled in music and song, and was skilled in calligraphy and painting. He once copied Master Sanfeng’s portrait, adding a jade zither played thrice and a jade flute, evoking the transcendent’s otherworldly elegance.

**Zhang Sanfeng’s Tide-Viewing Site on the Wu River in Zunyi Prefecture**

The sea’s turning knows no reckoning of years,
Travelers still speak of the immortal.
Here, rivers and mountains are free of dust,
Hills and valleys harbor an ancient affinity.
Across the river, temple bells chime as they cross the ridge,
Before the gate, snow-white waves threaten to overturn the sky.
From afar, I know the day he sat in stillness watching the tide—
More profound than reading the *Autumn Floods* chapter of the *Zhuangzi*.

**Yang Zhongtao**
Styled Chunping, sobriquet Futing, a native of Leshan County, a senior licentiate.

**Hu the Palace Attendant Visits Zhang Sanfeng**

A crane of the Yuan descends in flight,
Qi gathers between heaven and earth.
With imperial decree in hand,
He traces the immortal’s tracks through cloud and stream.
Treading the realm of empty clarity,
Chanting aloft on mist-wreathed peaks.
One shoulder bears sun and moon,
Two eyes discern the ancient pines.
Straw hat and sandals brave a thousand li,
Mists and rosy clouds traverse ten thousand layers.
The temple’s golden splendor stands revealed,
The palace meets the Jade Purity’s domain.
Ten years he traverses wind and dust,
Three Mountains’ stone caves sealed.
Returning, echoes linger still—
His lineage flows on, dragon-like in fruit.

**Li Chaohua**
Styled Qinfeng, a native of Leshan County, an outer licentiate.

**Hu the Palace Attendant Visits Zhang Sanfeng**

Phoenix edict descends the cinnabar steps,
Simurgh carriage enters the purple haze.
This journey wearies the attendant—
Where to seek the true immortal?
His lineage traces back to dragon and tiger,
His radiance concealed in market and town.
Lofty traces rival Qi Jijing,
Illusory deeds surpass Zhou Dian.
Rain and snow chill the star-borne carriage,
Mountains and rivers shift with the years.
He searches all the roads of Qin and Shu,
Treading through water and sky.
Sword and sash return to the three halls,
A decade of wind and frost endured.
With Jianwen, he sought the same figure,
The crane’s chariot drifting ever onward.

**Li Chaoba**
Styled Cuiyan, a native of Leshan County.

**Hu the Palace Attendant Visits Zhang Sanfeng**

In the boundless void of mist and nothingness,
Step by step, he seeks the crane’s trail.
The envoy risks a thousand years,
The emperor reveres Sanfeng.
Short robe and long sash in proper form,
Round eyes and large ears in noble mien.
A recluse in mist and rosy clouds,
An ancient immortal of heaven and earth.
With ritual gifts of books, incense, and silk,
He asks for pines by water and stone.
Some say he rides a tiger—
Where to find the soaring dragon?
A thousand li of clouds he treads,
Ten thousand paths of empty trails.
Returning to court, he speaks of illusory traces,
His lingering thoughts ascend to jade peaks.

**Liu Guangze**

**Reflections on Tiangu Cave**

A single aperture of primordial chaos links to long life,
When Zhang the Elder came, stone cranes cried.
A perilous cliff holds the immortals’ path to heaven,
Piercing clouds and splitting stone, the flute’s notes ring.
Within the profound darkness, jade gates gleam,
In purity’s midst, worldly passions fade.
To refine the elixir of return, this is the place—
Who has matched Du Dongying of Tang?
*(Du Guangting refined the elixir here!)*

**Zhang Shenghong**
Styled Ziyuan, sobriquet Heting, a native of Leshan County.

**Inscription on the Painting *Feng Xian Sleeps on Mount Taihe***

In hues of Huaxu’s realm it’s writ,
The sleep of immortals, rich and thick.
Taihe’s primal qi in union flows,
High-reclined ‘neath seals of cloud he goes.
Companions all are slumbering cranes,
Silent as hibernating dragons’ chains.
Let men call him slovenly—he cares not,
His rest lingers ‘mid the frosted pines’ knot.

**Song of Longing for Immortals on Heming Mountain**

Immortals, one and all, ride cranes away,
Yet this crane alone for Zhang’s house stays.
At first, Xuqing soared to heaven’s height (*See Immortal Biographies*; also in ancient verse: *"One by one, crane cries ascend the sky"*),
Then Sanfeng passed again—cliffs echoed loud and bright.
It sings not unless meeting perfected ones,
One cry, and fragrant winds arise anon.
Five hundred years and more have passed since then,
‘Mid pines, the sleeping crane lies still, unseen.
Perhaps its master yet in stillness bides,
Concealed in cloudy vales, in fetal breath abides.
Wait till he long-whistles into mountains deep,
Then, as before, it will to his call leap.

The recluse of Pingquan refines cinnabar,
Lute in hand, wine in tow, he treads mist and afar.
Cold streams babble day and night,
Deep cliffs, secluded, hide the immortal’s site.
Here the hermit dwells in quietude,
Surrounded by green walls exhaling cloudy mood.
Before the Bagua Pavilion, slow his pace,
Ascending the Welcoming Immortals’ Tower, step by grace.
I picture the master bowing to white clouds,
Gourd and patched robe far from worldly crowds.
Thrice summoned, he spurned Hongwu’s might,
Ten years sought in vain by Jianwen’s light.
His transformations boundless—who knows his face?
Last night in dreams, I met him in that place.
A feather-clad Daoist came, light and fleet,
To rouse the drowsy sleeper at the sacred seat.

**Zhang Sanfeng’s Bagua Pavilion on Heming Mountain**

The hidden immortal lets waters and clouds flow,
In the Bagua Pavilion, all things he does know.
He grasps precelestial qi’s ebb and tide,
Seeks secluded ground to ponder Fu Xi’s guide.
A hundred-fold great trees he once did plant,
One gate of primordial pass he’d grant.
To fathom yin and yang, creation’s art,
Guests arrive—best share the crane’s own part.

**Reading *Cloud and Water Collection***

Heaven’s winds blow, the sea stands tall,
Clouds race ten thousand leagues through azure’s hall.
The old Dragon Master loves soaring verse,
His echoes linger, piercing gold and stone.
Tattered hat, patched robe—he roams afar,
Strange waters, wondrous peaks are home by far.
In ancient grottoes, white deer slumber deep,
Great cauldrons forge cinnabar from cosmic sweep.
A myriad households’ seals—what are they worth?
Who matches the pines and rocks of this earth?
A true man’s noble aim aspires to purity,
How could he bear dust’s toil for fame’s futility?

The master once sailed the official’s sea,
When parents passed, he knew it time to flee.
In youth, Xiangping cast his home aside,
How could marriage delay his wanderings wide?
At the hundred-foot pole, he strove ahead,
Meeting a master who revealed heaven’s thread.
He recognized his former master’s face,
No more lost in willows’ or flowers’ embrace.

A bond from Elder Bi’s own hand,
A southern guest admires his mystic stand.
Eight hundred fire-oxen plow the moonlit night,
Three thousand beauties laugh in spring’s delight (*after Shen Wansan’s lines*).
Heroes of White Down gladly lend their aid,
Refining golden blooms with outer guard arrayed.
Turning back to Zhongnan, he met a fire-dragon,
His purse now empty, tears of joy were drawn.
When wind came over water, in delight he stood,
In Jinling, at ease, he strolled the neighborhood.
One day he gathered metal from the moon’s west side,
Like a leviathan, he leapt to heaven’s tide.
Elixir wrought, he brushed his sleeves and left,
Let dragons coil and tigers crouch—they’re bereft.
He drank his fill at taverns, staff in hand,
Cultivating vast qi through sea and land.
In his gourd, carefree, spring and autumn blend,
No need to seek lords’ or marquises’ attend.
Secret decrees sought him in borderlands,
His lofty integrity matched Chao and Xu’s stands.
North and south of mountains, songs resound,
Straw cloak and hat—he rests on cloudy ground.
Transforming into simurgh, crane, or fisherman,
Wherever he goes, he meets immortal sloven!
His nature vast as the cosmos’ round,
Benevolent clouds shade Jiannan’s ground.
To mend the unfinished in his heart,
Xian Shen first passed, then Wang Xian’s art.

The inspector of Jiannan—a Penglai guest,
In former life, his spirit was possessed.
On Mount Emei, praying for rain, he met his guide,
De Fu vanished like mist to Huan Valley’s side.
In Yangzhou, he shed his shell, returned to void,
Handed down heart’s transmission, left his alchemical abode.
Langhuan’s secrets guarded by ghosts and sprites,
What alchemist ever dreamed of such rites?
Six hundred years, the qi flows unbroken,
Like linked pearls or paired jades, the line’s unspoken.
Its light rivals sun and moon, illumining heaven and earth,
Its winds stir forests and springs, summoning heroes’ worth.
Morality so lofty, its wonders ne’er named,
Dew-drenched, it washes the Great Purity’s frame.
Those beyond the world sing *Cloud and Water’s* lay,
They should bow their heads to the master today.

**Nine-Chambered Cliff on Mount Taihe, Where Master Sanfeng Recluded**

The peak of Yuan Yue soars ten thousand *xun* high,
The perfected one once slept where white clouds lie.
A thousand ancient trees seal the cinnabar ridge,
A wisp of cold mist guards the emerald bridge.
At the cave’s mouth, winds play the flute’s clear tune,
‘Neath pines, the moon shines white on the zither’s croon.
Now, among the thirty-six cliffs’ array,
I still imagine the master’s golden words’ sway.

**At the Southern Cliff of Mount Wudang, Where Master Sanfeng Refined the Elixir—Composed from Lines of *Cloud and Water Poems* and *Mysteries Essential***

Flowing water, drifting clouds—they ne’er restrain,
A long whistle shakes the autumn sky of Chu’s domain.
He sought the thousand-year-old herb beyond the world’s ken,
Forgot the myriad bushels of mortal men’s woe.
Naturally, he dissolved the void in dew’s embrace,
Ever cold-eyed, he watched the lords’ and marquises’ show.
Within the cave, a small heaven and earth he kept,
Nurturing the returning elixir, on crane-back he leapt.

**Also**

Nine years he faced the wall, his spirit refined,
Who knew the hermit in seclusion joy would find?
A single millet-grain of pearl holds heaven and earth,
Two iron flutes blow apart the dawn’s misty dearth.
Tempering desires, calming the heart, stilling thoughts’ tide,
Burying his name, hiding like a madman, he’d abide.
His mind on purity, his spirit serene,
He concealed his traces, as if never had been.

The great elixir refined, he transcended the mortal plane,
Leaving all behind, a carefree immortal beyond the world’s chain.

**On History**
The Ming Emperor sought Three Peaks,
For ten years, he could not meet.
Heard he dwelt south of Southern Mountain,
Yet had gone north of Northern Mountain’s seat.
Wherever he roamed, joy and freedom he found,
His odd renown spread, unkempt and unbound.
The vast desert was his homeland,
Great Harmony his dwelling ground.
At that time, the fangshi throng,
Self-promoting, clamored long.
The Master, shamed by their display,
In ink’s dark midst, saw white hold sway.
Heaven and sea echoed with clouds’ roar,
Wind and dust obscured his form once more.
Flying dragon or hidden serpent deep,
Who could fathom his concealment’s sweep?

**Hidden Mirror Chronicle**
In the ninth dream of the Wang clan, it was said:
*"That the Master was a true immortal, many have heard;
That he was a recluse, few have known."*
In leisure, with a tranquil heart,
Jin Shijun, the Prefect, came to call.
Incense burned, they spoke of the Master’s wondrous trail.
The Prefect asked: *"Why not inscribe his seclusion as a mirror,
To illuminate the Master’s great integrity?"*
Xiling replied: *"So be it."*
Thus, emulating the *Outline and Details* style, he recorded it,
Naming it *Hidden Mirror Chronicle*, to honor truth’s pursuit.
From this, the Master’s hidden traces and his chronicle of years
Are both preserved herein—may future kindred spirits continue it.

**[Outline]** In the summer of the seventeenth Hongwu year, jiazi,
An edict sought the former Yuan’s retired elder,
A one-hundred-and-thirty-seven-year-old man,
The recluse of Mount Wudang, Zhang Three Peaks—he was not seen.

**[Details]** Three Peaks was from Yizhou.
Born in the second year of Emperor Dingzong of Yuan,
He retired as Magistrate of Boling during the Zhiyuan era.
He sought the Dao between Zhongnan and Taibai,
Receiving the true transmission of Master Xiyi.
His learning took loyalty, filial piety, compassion, and reverence as its essence,
The River Chart, Luo Writing, and Yi imagery as its application.
In the twenty-seventh Zhizheng year, dingwei,
Three Peaks was already one hundred and twenty.
In the intercalary seventh month of the wushen year,
The Yuan’s fate ended; Ming Taizu inherited heaven’s mandate.
Three Peaks then vanished into the deep mountains.
In the seventeenth year, meritorious ministers were enfeoffed,
All under heaven submitted; an edict sought those of high virtue and long life.
Hearing that the former Yuan’s Zhang Three Peaks, over a hundred years old,
Dwelt in reclusion on Mount Wudang, the emperor summoned him—he was not seen.

**[Illumination]** Writing *"former Yuan’s retired elder"* particularly marks his steadfastness.
Writing *"one-hundred-and-thirty-seven-year-old man"* particularly honors his longevity.
Writing *"recluse of Mount Wudang"* shows his lofty integrity and pure breeze,
Worthy to be a teacher for a hundred generations.

**[Outline]** In the spring of the eighteenth year,
Shen Wansan and Qiu Yuanjing were sent to seek the recluse of Mount Wudang, Zhang Three Peaks—he was not seen.

**[Details]** Wansan was from Nanjing.
Yuanjing was from Wudang.
Both were disciples of Three Peaks.
The Taizu emperor ordered the two to seek him,
Believing disciples could surely persuade their master—yet he remained unattainable.
Mr. Jin said: The phrasing *"sent Shen Wansan and Qiu Yuanjing"* to seek Three Peaks,
The single word *"sent"* directly reveals the Taizu emperor’s intent to constrain the hermit’s retreat.
Who knew that one of unyielding integrity,
Even disciples could not compel to appear?
Sought again, yet unseen—the edict grew more pressing,
His traces more concealed.

**[Outline]** In the summer of the twenty-fourth year,
Zhang Yuchu was sent to seek the recluse of Mount Wudang, Zhang Three Peaks—he was still not seen.

**[Details]** Yuchu was from Mount Longhu.
A descendant of the Celestial Master, he inherited the sword and seal, bearing the title *Zhenren* ("Perfected One"), and was of the same clan as Three Peaks.
At this time, Yuchu was sent to seek him, yet he remained unseen.
Mr. Jin said: Sending Zhang Yuchu to seek Three Peaks was to dispatch a clansman in search of another—another repetition of the earlier tactic. Thrice sought, thrice unseen: how could this compare to those who take shortcuts on Mount Zhongnan or trade on empty reputations!

**[Outline]** In the fifth year of Yongle, *dinghai* (1407),
Hu Ying was commanded to seek the recluse Zhang Three Peaks—he was not seen for ten years.

**[Details]** Hu Ying, a *jishizhong* (Supervising Secretary) of the Ministry of Revenue, had once been acquainted with Three Peaks.
The Chengzu emperor, admiring Three Peaks’ lofty character, now sent Hu Ying to seek him, traversing the realm while also investigating the whereabouts of the Jianwen emperor.
After ten years, he finally returned.
Mr. Jin said: Histories claim that the search for Zhang Three Peaks was to locate the Jianwen emperor’s refuge—this is not so. The recluse’s fame had stirred the previous court, and the Chengzu emperor, long aware of his renown while still a prince, could not have failed to admire his virtue, longevity, and revered stature. Would he not have yearned to present him at court, as the Song Taizong emperor had rejoiced at meeting Chen Tuan? To say he *"also investigated the Jianwen emperor’s whereabouts"* is perhaps a veiled way to convey the Chengzu emperor’s true intent.

**[Outline]** In the third month of the tenth year,
Sun Yuanxu, styled Biyun, was ordered to await the recluse Zhang Three Peaks at Mount Wudang—he did not come.

**[Details]** Five years had passed since Hu Ying and others were sent to seek Three Peaks, yet the Chengzu emperor’s desire to meet him never waned. Believing he would surely come to Wudang, he commanded Yuanxu to bring letters and gifts and wait for him there in advance.
Mr. Jin said: The phrase *"ordered Sun Yuanxu to await him at Wudang in advance"* reveals how deeply the Chengzu emperor’s longing for the recluse lingered! Could this truly have been for the Jianwen emperor?

**[Outline]** In the first month of the fourteenth year,
the emperor sent an *anju* (imperial carriage) to welcome the recluse Zhang Three Peaks of Mount Wudang—he did not come.

**[Details]** The previous year, Sun Yuanxu had been stationed at Mount Wudang to build a palace and await Three Peaks. By winter, Three Peaks finally returned to Wudang, and Yuanxu, overjoyed, dispatched a messenger to report to the emperor.
This spring, the emperor sent an *anju* to welcome him, but Three Peaks had suddenly departed elsewhere, leaving the emperor deeply disappointed.
Mr. Jin said: The Chengzu emperor’s *"command to welcome with an imperial carriage"*—his sincerity, his utmost courtesy—was unmatched in ancient or modern times. The master’s true nature was now revealed.

**[Outline]** In the fifth month of the fourteenth year,
Zhang Three Peaks, a 168-year-old recluse of Mount Wudang, entered court.

**[Details]** The emperor, his desire to meet Three Peaks so fervent yet so long unfulfilled, commanded Hu Guang to journey to Mount Wudang and weep in prayer.
Upon hearing this, Three Peaks concealed his body in a cave and projected his *yangshen* (spiritual essence), transforming into a recluse who wore a bamboo hat and a deerskin robe. He then soared into the golden hall and prostrated before the steps.
At that moment, the emperor was holding court. Seeing him, he marveled and inquired, recognizing him as Three Peaks. He then reverently asked about the Dao of longevity.
Three Peaks replied: *"Cultivate few desires, settle the mind, calm the spirit, and refine the thoughts—this is the Dao of longevity for Your Majesty."*
The emperor asked: *"Why have you repeatedly refused to see me, yet now come so readily?"*
Three Peaks said: *"I am but a rustic, of no use in these times. Thus, I have practiced grain avoidance, emerged from the *niwan* (mud-pill palace), and come before you today as my *yangshen*. In the past, the Taizu emperor could not drown Zhou Dian in the river or restrain Leng Qian before his banner—both were *dharmakāya*, not flesh. My appearance now is merely to repay your long and arduous search."*
With these words, he vanished.

The emperor bestowed upon him the title "Master Soaring Dragon."

When ministers Hu Ying and Hu Guang returned to court, they heard that Three Peaks had already come to pay homage to the emperor and departed. Jin Shi remarked: *"A reclusive elder of one hundred sixty-eight years,"* inscribing it prominently with full evidence—among the hermits of the mountains and forests, he was one for the ages. He further stated: *"Today, I appeared before Your Majesty as my* yangshen." *Thus, we know that those who soar in broad daylight and project their* yangshen *are capable of such feats. Truly, the master is like a dragon!*

**[Outline]** In the spring of the third year of Tianshun, the reclusive immortal Zhang Three Peaks came to court.
**[Entry]** The emperor had long revered men of virtue and Dao. Three Peaks, perceiving his sincerity, manifested in full spirit to pay homage. His face was purple, his complexion deep crimson, his long beard bristling like a halberd. His topknot hung behind his head, resembling the Dark Warrior. His belly was broad, his shoulders thick, and he arrived girded with a sash, wearing a bamboo hat. Bowing deeply, he said: *"Your servant Three Peaks wishes Your Majesty to cultivate the self and pacify the people, cast out the perverse and uphold the upright."* Then he vanished.

The emperor personally composed a eulogy to praise him, bestowing the title *"Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery and Manifest Transformation."* Jin Shi remarked: *"Recluses are called 'reclusive immortals' to signify that lofty men do not die."* Each audience and each enfeoffment is attested by clear records—how could the ancients deceive us? From this, the name of divine immortals has been eternally extolled without falsehood.

**[Outline]** In the spring of the twenty-second year of Chenghua, an edict specially enfeoffed the former hermit of Mount Taihe, Zhang Three Peaks, as *"Perfected Immortal of Concealed Radiance and Lofty Aspiration,"* and Zhou Dian as *"Perfected Immortal of Proclaiming the Dao and Assisting Transformation."*
**[Entry]** At the time, both Buddhist and Daoist clergy had recklessly usurped titles and seals, acting greedily and lawlessly. The emperor, displeased, followed the memorials of the censorial officials and stripped the Buddhist and Daoist clergy of their titles of *National Preceptor* and *Perfected One.* He specially enfeoffed Three Peaks as *"Perfected Immortal of Concealed Radiance and Lofty Aspiration"* and Zhou Dian as *"Perfected Immortal of Proclaiming the Dao and Assisting Transformation."*
**[Exposition]** The inscription *"former hermit of Mount Taihe"* extols his noble character and towering integrity, untouched by the base filth of alchemists. *"Perfected Immortal"* rejects false Daoists.

**[Outline]** In the autumn of the forty-second year of Jiajing, Zhang Three Peaks was enfeoffed as *"True Lord of Pure Emptiness and Primordial Mystery."*
**[Entry]** In his later years, the emperor was deeply fond of esoteric arts. Hearing that Three Peaks had manifested in Nanjing, he sought his writings everywhere and obtained *The Essential Mysteries.* Upon reading it, he sighed: *"A true immortal of our dynasty."* He then enfeoffed him as *"True Lord of Pure Emptiness and Primordial Mystery"* and issued an edict to build the Pure Emptiness Abbey at Three Peaks’ former dwelling to offer sacrifices to him.
**[Exposition]** *"Pure"* means unstained by things; *"emptiness"* means one with the great void—these two characters are most excellent.

**[Outline]** In the autumn of the third year of Tianqi, the spirit of Zhang Three Peaks manifested in the palace, and he was posthumously enfeoffed as *"True Lord of Soaring Dragon Manifestation, Vast Benevolence, and Salvation of the World."*
**[Entry]** Due to the many troubles of the times, the emperor had set up a planchette in the palace to summon immortals. Suddenly, a red light enveloped the throne, and within it appeared the true visage of Three Peaks. The emperor bowed and said: *"True immortal, teach me; true immortal, protect me."* The revealed words were profound, and after some time, he vanished. Moved, the emperor followed the precedent of *"Master Soaring Dragon, Manifest Perfected One"* and posthumously enfeoffed him as *"True Lord of Soaring Dragon Manifestation, Vast Benevolence, and Salvation of the World."*
Meng Jiu Shi remarked: *"The radiance of the master, a pure flood-dragon, has illuminated the Ming dynasty to its utmost."* **Collected Records**

At that time and place—In former generations, during the Han dynasty, Marquis of Liu Zhang Zifang, who hailed from Fengyi in Peiguo. His ninth-generation descendant, Celestial Master Daoling, resided at Dragon-Tiger Mountain in Xinzhou, Jiangxi, and thus transmitted the Dao within his family. A later descendant, Yu Xian, lived during the Song dynasty. Toward the end of the Southern Song, he migrated to Liaodong and fathered a son, Chang. Chang begot Sanfeng, whose departure from the household (as with Zifang) and original biography are recorded elsewhere.

He was a man of the early Yuan dynasty, and this is correct. His biography states that he was born on the ninth day of the fourth lunar month in the dingwei year of Yuan Dingzong’s reign, at the hour of zi—this account is accurate. That he was a man of the Jin dynasty is erroneous. The *History of the Ming* states: *"Some say he was a man of the Jin dynasty."* However, according to the *History of the Yuan*: *"In the ninth year of Taizong, Genghis Khan (jiaxu, May), the army marched south to conquer the Jin, attacking Yizhou. Prefect Gao Tongshan died in battle, and Liaozhou thereafter fell under Yuan rule."* By this reckoning, when the master was born, Liaozhou had long been under Yuan control, making it clear he was not a man of the Jin dynasty.

That he was a man of the late Yuan is erroneous. An anonymous biography claims: *"He emerged during the late Yuan."* This error requires no refutation. That he was a man of the early Ming is also erroneous, as seen in other biographies.

That he was a native of Yizhou in Liaoyang is correct, as all biographies concur. The *History of the Yuan* records: *"In the early Yuan, Liaoyang was established as the Eastern Capital."* During the reign of Shizu (Kublai Khan), the Liaoyang Branch Secretariat was established, governing seven circuits. The first was the Liaoyang Circuit, initially overseeing one prefecture, Posuo Prefecture (later abolished), and two subprefectures: Liaoyang Subprefecture and Yizhou (also called Gai Yizhou). The *History of the Ming* states: *"Yizhou lies 1,700 li from the capital."* During the Ming, Liaoyang Subprefecture was renamed Zou Liao Guard, later restored as Liaoyang Subprefecture and County, and finally reorganized into the Liaodong Regional Military Commission.

That he was a native of Tianmu is erroneous. The *Comprehensive Gazetteer of Sichuan* notes: *"Some say he was from Tianmu."* This likely stems from his having once resided there, as the *Preface to Cloud and Water* includes his *"Song of Tianmu Mountain."* That he was from Jizhou, Yizhou, or Yizhou is erroneous. These claims appear in popular editions, as all three—Ji, Yi, and Yi—are northern regions, and their names resemble "Yi" in sound, hence the confusion.

The tombs of his sacred parents lie on Jicui Mountain in Liaoyang. As seen in the *Preface to Cloud and Water*, in his poem *"Reply to Liu Zhonghui,"* the master writes: *"The Long White Dragon stretches a thousand li; I have concealed myself within it since childhood."* Jiuyangzi’s *Travels in Liaodong* records: *"Changbai Mountain lies sixty li south of the former Huining Prefecture, spanning a thousand li with peaks rising two hundred li. A pool on its ridge, eighty li in circumference and unfathomably deep, is called the Heavenly Pond. Its southern flow becomes the Yalu River, while its northern course forms the Huntong River. Between them, a great dragon coils within, and a smaller branch extends to Jicui Mountain in Liaoyang, where the ancestral tomb of Master Zhang Sanfeng lies."* The Great Mountain Palace at Cicheng and the Small Mountain Gate, with their immortal bridges, truly capture my admiration—this is no falsehood.

Names and Titles.

The Master once remarked: "My names and titles have often coincided with those of others, past and present. Upon learning of such overlaps, I would alter them to ease my mind—thus they have remained ever-shifting and uncertain. I was once named Tong, identical to the son of my distant ancestor, the venerable Gao; and Jin, the same as my collateral ancestor, the Han Grand Marshal, both recorded in the *Genealogy of the Marquis of Liu*. I was also named Silian, matching the courtesy name of Yu Susheng of the Yuan; Xuansu, the same as a Tang remonstrator during the reign of Emperor Taizong; and Xuanhua, identical to a disciple of Ge Xuan. From these two names, I took the first character of each to form Xuánxuánzǐ. Yet this too echoed the sacred title of the Most High, so I changed it to Shanfeng. But this coincided with Pu Yangzi, so I altered it again to Sanfeng. Then it matched that of a sexual cultivation practitioner—how laughable! Still, the name Sanfeng had been used for so long that I was reluctant to change it further. Reflecting on the hexagram Qian’s unbroken lines and Kun’s broken ones, I realized they could not restore pure Qian. Thus, I planted a root of unyielding qi within the earth of Kun, mending its discontinuity to restore its wholeness. From this day forth, I shall be called Quanyi, with the courtesy name Sanfeng—my names and titles now firmly settled.

As for my unkempt appearance and disregard for grooming, the world’s nickname for me—Zhang Latta—is a singular marvel, unmatched through the ages. Aha! *Record of the Grotto-Heaven!*

The name Tong appears in Lu Ziyuan’s *Jottings from the Jade Hall*. The name Jin is recorded in the *Gazetteer of Kuizhou Prefecture*. The Master himself noted that these two names matched those of his distant ancestors. According to the *Genealogy of the Marquis of Liu*: "Buyi succeeded to the marquisate and had two sons, Dian and Gao. Dian begot Mo, Mo begot the Grand Marshal Jin, Jin begot the Marquis of Yangling, Qianqiu, Qianqiu begot Zisong, Zisong begot Zhuang, Zan, Peng, Mu, and Shu, whose descendants distinguished themselves through meritorious deeds. Gao begot Tong, Tong begot Wuwang, Wuwang begot Liren, Liren begot Hao, Hao begot Gang, Gang begot Yi." Yi sojourned on Tianmu Mountain in Wu, where his wife, née Lin, bore Daoling. Later, he returned to Pei Commandery and eventually settled on Longhu Mountain in Xinzhou.

The name Silian appears in the *Old Gazetteer of Kuizhou Prefecture*. The Master himself noted that this name matched the courtesy name of Yu Susheng. According to the *History of the Yuan*: "Zhang Xian, styled Silian, a poet from Shanyin, was a man of talent and ambition. He journeyed to the capital and boldly discoursed on state affairs, but his counsel was ignored. He then retired to Fuchun Mountain, mingling with Buddhists and Daoists in reclusion. When Zhang Shicheng occupied Wu, he was appointed as a military aide. After Wu fell, he changed his name and fled to Hangzhou. He was the poet Yang Lianfu referred to as 'the iron-gated one.'" There was also a Zhang Silian from Suichang.

Residing at Shouguang Palace as a Daoist, he recited the *Supreme Scripture of Salvation* and gained enlightenment. Thereafter, he ceased speech and at times abstained from food. After more than forty years, he ascended as an immortal.

His name was Xuansu, as recorded in the *Preface to the Essential Writings*. His name was Xuanhua, as noted in the *Song of Returning the Elixir* within the *Essential Writings*. The Master himself stated that these two names matched those of the Jin dynasty physician Jiegu the Pure Elder, as well as those of Ge Yuan’s disciples. According to records, the Jin physician Zhang Jiegu of Mingzhou, also named Xuansu, failed the imperial examinations and transmitted his medical teachings instead. His courtesy name was Xuanxuan. The Master himself claimed this matched the sacred title of the Supreme Lord. As the *Old唐书* states, Laozi was styled the Mysterious Primordial Emperor, and Bai Juyi’s poem reads: *"The profoundly profound five thousand words of the* Daodejing." His courtesy names were Shanfeng and Sanfeng. The Master himself said these two names aligned with those of Puyangzi and the practitioners of *cai-zhan*. This has already been clarified in the *Rectification of Errors* within his collected works, and thus will not be repeated here. His courtesy name was Junshi. All biographies list this as his given name, but only Ziyuan’s *Random Notes* and his own biography correctly record it as his courtesy name. His courtesy names were Xuanyi, Quanyi, and Sanfeng. His sobriquet was Kunyang. As seen in his collected biography, the *Records of Grotto Heavens* state of the Master: *"From this day forward, he shall be named Quanyi, styled Sanfeng, and thus his name and sobriquet are firmly established."* Master Changyi notes: The Master’s names and sobriquets changed repeatedly yet often coincided. Later biographers should regard this statement as definitive.

**Legacy Sites**
Fuquan Mountain lies several *li* south of the prefectural city. The *Comprehensive Gazetteer* records it as *"the place where Zhang Sanfeng cultivated the Dao."* Formerly the site of Gaozhen Abbey, it later became the Ritual of the Dipper Pavilion. Before the pavilion lies the Immortal’s Bathing Pool, which neither overflows in summer nor dries in winter and can cure illnesses. According to the *Pingyue Prefecture Gazetteer*, the Chess-Stone at Fuquan Mountain, south of the prefectural city, is where later generations claim Zhang Sanfeng played *yi* with Marquis Longping Zhang Xin.

The Ritual of the Dipper Pavilion stands within Gaozhen Abbey, south of the prefectural city. Tradition holds that the immortal Zhang Sanfeng of the early Ming often performed the Dipper Ritual here. The *Seated Meditation Song* stele inscription within Fuquan Mountain’s Gaozhen Abbey was composed by the immortal Zhang Sanfeng, expounding on Daoist practice.

In Pingyue Prefecture, crossing the stone bridge at Shangmen Ferry and proceeding south along the street, one finds Gaozhen Abbey, the Daoist sanctuary of Master Zhang Sanfeng. Traveling northwest from there, one reaches Zhuobi Mountain, and ascending a slight incline to the west, Daoma Slope. Midway up the slope, a sheer cliff like a screen rises across the mountain, its thousand-*ren* precipice bearing the Master’s image: head crowned with a Huayang cap, staff in hand, walking sideways—clearly visible. Beside it, four large characters read *"Divine Trace Remains in the Cosmos,"* said to be the Master’s inscription, a numinous relic of the realm. The Sanfeng Shrine stands within Pingyue Prefecture’s city walls, containing a Ritual of the Dipper Pavilion. Before the pavilion lies a stone pool named the Immortal’s Bath, four to five *chi* deep, never drying in winter or summer. Nearby, a long-withered cassia tree revived when a Daoist, having bathed in the pool, hung his tattered robe upon it.

In the summer of the first year of the Tianqi era, Li Ruonan, the judicial commissioner stationed at Xintian, invited the *luán* spirit to descend. The brush wrote a *ci* poem: *"Ritual of the Dipper Pavilion, Ritual of the Dipper Pavilion—Zhang the Immortal borrowed this place to cultivate the Dao. Sun and moon hang overhead; wind and clouds pass like dust before the eyes. The Jasmine Sovereign, the Heavenly Sage of the *pū* Script, once tested my sincerity. Today, ranked among the immortals, manifesting numinous transformations, how dare I forget the traces entrusted to the Mystic Ford? Hearing my parents seek my name, I borrow these rustic words as a mirror."*

At Wu River in Zunyi Prefecture stands the site where Zhang Sanfeng observed the tide. Green mountains rise on the opposite bank, white waters flow before the gate, and to this day, his stone likeness remains. According to the *Guizhou Comprehensive Gazetteer*, two *li* east of Baoji County, springs scatter and flow down the mountainside, known as the Sal Tree Springs. The springs emerge from the summit of Jinbi Abbey, where the immortal Zhang Sanfeng once dwelled; his earthen cave still exists.

Master Sanfeng delighted in transcribing Tang poetry in a dragon-and-snake script. Those who obtained his works often carved them into stone as treasures for the world. The *Old Gazetteer of Chizhou* records: At Qingniu Abbey, a stele bears a regulated verse in an extraordinary calligraphic style, hailed as the Immortal’s Brush. The poem reads:
*"In immortal realms, idly seeking the herb-gathering elder,
A thatched hut retains our conversation this shared evening.
Behold the clouds’ depths below the mountain—
Truly, no human path leads through.
Springs draw lotus blossoms to the cave’s mouth;
The moon carries pine shadows east across the stream.
The heart set on fame finds leisure hard to dispel—
Tomorrow, hooves will tread the dust once more."*

This is a transcription of a Tang poem. During the Jiajing era, Grand Coordinator Liu Damu inscribed a colophon: *"This carving is like thunder, lightning, and spirits—unpredictably transformative, yet never straying from the Six Principles of Writing. Truly, none but an extraordinary person could achieve this. The Master of Nine Dragons should guard it well; if it were carried off by chariots or feathered carriages, would that not be a pity!"*

The *Records of Grotto Heavens* state: The immortal Sanfeng’s transcription of *"Idly Seeking in Immortal Realms"* bears the signature *"Written by the Jade Emperor’s Daoist Elder, the Grand Harmony Master."*

According to tradition, Immortal Zhang once secluded himself on the Great Harmony Mountain of Yuan Yue, hence his sobriquet "Master of Great Harmony." The common attribution of this calligraphy to Chen Tuan is mistaken. Lang Caoqiao claimed it was the work of some eccentric who had yet to enter officialdom, noting that it begins with *"Idly Seeking in Immortal Realms"* and ends with *"the heart set on fame."* How could an immortal utter such words? Yet he failed to grasp that the Master of Great Harmony simply admired Tang poetry and borrowed its lines to display his transcendent brushwork.

Today, the Two Immortals Temple in Chengdu Prefecture, Sichuan, also houses this stele—a re-engraved copy of the collapsed original. Elsewhere, on Mount Emei’s stone inscriptions, I have seen two other examples: *"Spring winds lean on the oars at Helü’s city; the Emperor’s son bids farewell to the vermilion phoenix gate,"* where each character twists like coiling dragons and serpents, the brushwork even more marvelous. The colophon reads *"Inscribed by Immortal Zhang,"* though these, too, are lines from Tang poetry. If judged by their content, one might again protest that *"The blue robe has now misled the scholar"* is hardly the language of immortals.

At Xiangfu Temple, the wall bears Zhang Sanfeng’s ink inscription of *"Soaring Fu Chan Cloister"*—substituting *"soaring"* for *"auspicious"*—its strokes writhing with the grace of coiled dragons in flight. This is the very calligraphy described in Tong Shan’s poem: *"Beside it, four characters large as fists, / split-bamboo script from Sanfeng’s own hand."*

*The Jinzhou Gazetteer* records that Bazhou County—now Bayue Mountain, fifteen *li* south of Tongliang—preserves Zhang Sanfeng’s fan, inkstone, and bamboo staff, still treasured by the temple monks.

*The Comprehensive Gazetteer of Sichuan* notes that a six-line poem in Sanfeng’s hand, brushed on silk, remains in the Zhuo family of Chengdu. It reads:
*"Vast qi surges through the cosmos,
Majestic and profound, with no other.
The white-jade-maned lion—
Originally, it dwells in my home."*
The characters surge with the force of celestial winds and oceanic waves, a relic of the late Ming.

*The Letters of Master Tong* describe the outer wall of the main hall on Gaobiao Mountain, where twenty characters of Meng Haoran’s poem are inscribed:
*"Spring slumber—dawn unnoticed,
Everywhere, birdsong.
Last night’s wind and rain—
How many blossoms fell?"*
The brushwork stretches and contracts, soaring and dancing with perfect control. Though much of the hall’s walls have crumbled and been replastered, this section alone remains unwhitewashed, its ink as fresh as the day it was laid down. Locals attribute it to Immortal Sanfeng’s brush.

*The Gazetteer of Leshan County* records that on Zhan Yun Peak of Jiuding Mountain, east of Jiazhou City, Zhang Sanfeng’s hand-carved inscription *"Dharma-Expounding Terrace"* is etched into the cliff. Above it stands the Clear Radiance Pavilion, where the immortal once discoursed with Prefect Wang.

The Lingyun Temple lies between Qiluan and Jifeng Peaks. Within it stands an ancient stele bearing an image of Immortal Feng seated on stone, reading. The inscription above, in clerical script, reads: *"Imperially Enfeoffed Flying Dragon, Salvation-of-the-World Perfected One, Penetrating-the-Mysterious Manifesting Transformation Celestial Worthy, Master Zhang Sanfeng."*

The former headquarters of the Jiannan Circuit now lie within the examination grounds of Jiading Prefecture. When Prefect Wang governed Jiannan, Master Zhang Sanfeng manifested himself there, prompting the construction of a pavilion at the foot of Gaobiao Mountain to honor him. The locals call it Sanfeng Tower. Before the tower stand several quiet chambers, their winding corridors and latticed railings opening onto wind pavilions and flower terraces—the very place where Prefect Wang once withdrew to cultivate stillness. Each evening, he would exit the rear gate of the headquarters and ascend the mountain by steps.

From the former site of Anle Garden, one brushes aside clouds and parts the trees to ascend, and upon reaching the tower’s front, must first burn incense and offer devout prayers to express a heart of purity and benevolence. The Immortal Elder, gazing down, acknowledges such sincerity. He then manifests his dharmakāya, engaging in discourse on scriptures and history, composing calligraphy and poetry—his transmitted secrets too numerous to recount.

In *Cao Shu of Seen and Heard* by Ruan Youtong

Several *li* southeast of Jiazhou, a solitary islet lies upon the river, near Wuyou and Ma’an, once recorded in old gazetteers as Qingyi’s Separate Isle. Master Zhang Sanfeng revealed his traces there, prompting local scholars and commoners to build pavilions and terraces in his honor. Within stand the Poetic Immortal Hall, Pure Yang Palace, Xuanran Terrace, Listening-to-the-Tides Pavilion, Bamboo-Embracing Studio, and two small pools named Moon-Imprinted and Sun-Encompassing. The Master left poems at each, a most refined affair.

In *Records of Grotto Heavens*

Within the mountains of Da County’s Heming, beneath the Welcoming Immortal Pavilion, stands a cypress planted by Zhang Sanfeng, its girth some fifty spans. Though now aged, only a withered stump remains, yet within it a young cypress has sprouted, nearly ten spans in girth.

In *Old Gazetteer of Sichuan*

Outside the Welcoming Immortal Pavilion on Heming Mountain, a stele bears Hu Ying’s poem in search of Zhang Sanfeng, its surface eroded by moss, leaving only the line *“A spirit of untrammeled brilliance, like jade concealed.”* The rest is blurred, yet it remains a treasured relic. The inscription’s colophon—*“Giving Secretary □ Ying”*—still bears three legible characters.

In *Old Gazetteer of Qiongzhou*

Within Heming Mountain stands the Eight Trigrams Pavilion, traditionally said to be where Master Zhang Sanfeng studied the *Yijing*. Its diagram places the Supreme Ultimate at its center, encircled by Fu Xi’s trigrams, illustrating the waxing and waning of yin and yang to clarify the advance and retreat of the elixir fire.

In *Records of Grotto Heavens*

When Emperor Hui perished in fire, rumors spread of his escape, with many former ministers following him. The Emperor grew suspicious. In the fifth year [of his reign], he dispatched Ying to distribute imperially composed books and seek the immortal Zhang Lǎotā, scouring every prefecture, county, and village. Secretly investigating the whereabouts of Emperor Jianwen, he returned only in the fourteenth year.

In *History of Ming: Biography of Hu Ying*

The Taizu Emperor commanded the Perfected Zhang Yuchu to seek Sanfeng, as recorded in a memorial by the Perfected One, preserved in the steles of Wudang. The Chengzu Emperor ordered the Giving Secretary Hu Ying to search the realm, leaving behind handwritten texts and poems, recorded in *Double Pagoda Annual Notes*.

In *Seven Revisions* (annotation)

During the Chengzu Emperor’s reign, Minister of War Hu Zhongduan was repeatedly dispatched to seek the Perfected Zhang Sanfeng, giving rise to the local saying in my hometown: *“Old Minister Hu chases Zhang Lǎotā.”*

In *Records of Pilgrimage in Bilin*

Old gazetteers record that Guiguzi, Yan Junping, Bai Yuchan, and Zhang Sanfeng all resided on Mount Emei. In *True Records of Divine Immortals*, it is said: Guigu was the teacher of Tai Xuan, dwelling on Qingcheng Mountain; Yan Junping remained on Emei, though his rank is unrecorded; Sanfeng, in the early Ming, befriended Guanghai, a monk of Kaiyuan Temple in Kuizhou. At their parting, he left a poem, a pair of straw sandals, and three pieces of aloeswood before departing. From this, it is certain that Sanfeng’s travels in Shu must have brought him to Emei. A thorough search of Bai’s collected works yields no mention of *“Emei,”* yet thirty *li* south of present-day Emei County lies Yuchan Bay. Along its cliffs, a path ascends to Yuchan Cave, capable of holding a thousand people. The cave’s walls shimmer like mica, faintly revealing the outline of a shoulder sash—traditionally said to be Yuchan’s place of liberation.

In *Supplementary Records of Emei* by Jiang Huchen

Within the city of Pingyue Prefecture, traces of Zhang Lǎotā’s Daoist cultivation remain at Gaozhen. During the Hongwu era, he wandered here, building a thatched pavilion. Secluding himself, he sat in silent meditation. Befriending Commander Zhang, he once drank and gambled with him, then pointed to the land of Yueshan Temple south of the city, saying, *“Buried here, one may be enfeoffed as a marquis.”* Zhang followed his advice and later earned the title Lord of Longping through military merit. Before the pavilion lies a pond that never dries, winter or summer, and beside it a cassia tree, also planted by his hand. Five *li* south of the prefecture stands Wu Sheng Pass. Across the stream, on sheer cliffs, remains an image of Sanfeng—wearing a Huayang cap, leaning on a staff as he walks, vivid as a painting. Beside it, Governor Guo Qingluo of the Ming inscribed four large characters: *“The Divine Lingers in the Cosmos.”* Below lies Night-Dripping Gold Bridge, where even on clear nights, droplets of rain fall. Further on is Sunset Glow, where slanting rays appear regardless of weather.

In *Travel Records* by Chen Ding of Jiangyin

Huang Gongwang, styled Zijiu, lived over ninety years, his eyes emerald-green, his cheeks crimson. One day at Tiger Dripping Temple in Wuling, standing on a rock with four companions, clouds and mist suddenly surged from the surrounding mountains, and in an instant, Zijiu vanished—presumed to have ascended as an immortal. I once suspected this tale was embellished by those enamored of his painting, but upon consulting the *Daoist Canon*’s *Jade Texts and Golden Writs*, I found that Gongwang had edited numerous works. His teacher was Jin Pengtou; his friends included Mo Yueding, Leng Qijing, and Zhang Sanfeng. Thus, it becomes clear that this elder originally hailed from the Ten Isles, and painting was but one of his cunning arts.

In *Miscellaneous Notes from the Purple Peach Studio*

Note: Gongwang’s paintings were unrivaled in his time. Zhang Zu and Leng Qian also gained fame as Northern School painters, their ink traces surely preserved in the homes of eminent scholars—hence the saying about their lingering traces.

*Addendum on Time and Place*
The people of Min.

The Error
*The Travels of Dian and Qian* states: "Sanfeng was a man of Min. During the Hongwu reign, he was conscripted under military registry to garrison Pingyue Prefecture, where he wandered the markets with disheveled hair and bare feet, begging—people called him the Slovenly Elder." ○ To claim the Patriarch was from Min may stem from his having once sojourned there. Yet the assertion that he was conscripted to garrison Pingyue Prefecture is utterly inexplicable. Could it be that when Shen Wansan was exiled to the frontier, the Patriarch was also banished to Guiyang? But then why did Emperor Taizu seek him out during the Hongwu era? [He was] a man of Baoji.

The Error
During the Ming, Du Mu traveled to Wangwu Mountain and recorded the Daoist Chen Xingchang, formerly of the Ziran Hermitage on Wudang, now eighty-eight years old, his spirit and qi still clear and flourishing, resembling one who has attained the Way. He had moved to this mountain twenty years prior, and his teachings were the true transmission of the immortal Zhang Sanfeng. He told me that Sanfeng’s given name was Yuanyuan, a native of Liaoyang, who styled himself the Retiring Elder of Sanfeng—few in the world knew his true name. He was still alive during the Zhengtong era, though his whereabouts became unknown. I asked: "People say he was from Baoji in Shaanxi—why is that?" Xingchang replied: "Baoji was merely a place he often stayed; he was not born there."

*Records of the Dao Altar*
An altar takes its name from the Dao, for the Dao is its root. Since divine immortals emerge from the Dao, those who invoke it must receive its descent through the Dao. Now, in setting up altars to summon immortals, scholar-officials often find this matter strange. Yet within it, some things are credible, others not. When the spirit-writing hand is upright, it is credible; when it is perverse, it is hard to believe. When the intent is sincere, it is credible; when it is false, it is hard to believe. When the style is pure and refined, it is credible; when it is vulgar and coarse, it is hard to believe. Moreover, the brush of an immortal must produce words of distinction. When a person speaks, they must establish their greatness. If the poetry and prose are crude, the principles shallow and careless, filled with monstrous and deceptive nonsense—how could these be the words of an immortal! Alas! Alack!

I have come to understand. The master said: *"What that lot does may be set aside and left undiscussed. I, with two or three of you, shall discourse on subtle principles, uphold purity and loftiness, and let the brush follow where inspiration leads. Then the hexagrams of the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*, the teachings of Dao and virtue, loyalty and filial piety, the maxims of former Confucians, the doctrines of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Yin Xi, and Lie Yukou, the essences of the *Triple Unification* and *Awakening to Reality*—all these may enrich our learning and give free rein to our words. How delightful this would be!"*

He also said: *"People seek immortality and liberation through divination of good and ill fortune, believing if it proves true and doubting if it does not. Yet you, my friends, should not indulge such foolish sentiments. Fortune and misfortune are decreed by Heaven—what benefit is there in knowing them? What harm in not knowing? Where principle abides, qi abides; where qi abides, fate abides. Principle is the master, qi is its flowing manifestation, and fate is the interplay of generation and restriction. Seek only where principle finds its peace, and even qi and fate will not oppose it."*

The disciples, suddenly enlightened, exclaimed: *"How grand your words! The teachings you impart to us are profound indeed."* Thereupon they recorded several passages of the *"Record of the Dao Altar"* to attest to its truth, that those who love the Dao might come to know the master.

The master then invited his disciples to ascend the clouds with wine, setting up an altar in the Eastern Slope Pavilion. There they expounded several chapters of the *Dao and Its Virtue*, each listening intently. He then commanded a lute-bearer to place the instrument upon the table, where fine incense was lit and ancient paintings unfurled. Together they descended, while their companions sipped tea in the front pavilion, joined by four or five mountain monks, laughing as they faced the river and hills. Suddenly, from the pavilion above, the sound of a lute arose—faint as a spring dawn in the grotto-heavens, vast as the clouds over the Xiao and Xiang rivers—yet no one was there. That day, all the disciples heard the master’s lute.

In early winter, with the cold biting and a light snow just clearing, the master descended from the mountains to discourse on the Dao and dispel the chill for his disciples. He said: *"Now I shall wander and chant among the snow—who among you will follow me?"* Soon after, a young novice reported: *"Before the gate stands a Daoist in a straw cloak, moving as swiftly as flight."* Hanxu, unable to catch up, later wrote a poem:

*"Few in the world knew the master’s worth,
I recognized him, yet my steps were slow.
Snow filled the bridge, no footprints left,
Clouds returned to sea and peaks, brimming with feeling.
Another wind has passed—how far it flew!
When will the crane-drawn carriage return?
Even chasing Han Yu was no easy task—
On the moonlit path home, I imagine his noble form."*

The master then entered Mount Qingcheng with his disciples, seeking a secluded place to build a thatched hut and cultivate stillness, lingering long without desire to leave. One day, upon the Flying Immortal Stone, he wrote: *"Now I shall reveal myself for you all to see."* Proceeding to the rear of the Supreme Clarity Palace, they suddenly saw a boy acting as if afraid of people, slipping into a great boulder. The disciples thought nothing of it. Later, leaning against a perilous cliff, they followed a narrow path, spiraling down to the Heavenly Master’s Cave, but saw nothing. Returning to the Supreme Clarity Palace, one disciple said: *"That boy today must have been the master—his vanishing into the stone was a lesson in retiring into profound concealment."*

The master kept his disciples in Mount Qingcheng for several days.

Gazing upon the marvels of Great Face Peak, where the azure void pierces the heavens; affirming the refined bond of shared hearts, as emptiness and purity arise in the courtyard. One day, he spoke to his disciples: *"Shall we return? General Yao’s snow has sealed the mountain."* Thereupon, they hastened their preparations and passed through Qiongzhou. Fifteen li beyond Taipingchang, they turned to look back at the famed mountain—already crimson clouds draped the ridges, and the snowy air filled the sky.

The master said to Panshanzi: *"If a scholar cannot rouse himself to serve in the court, he ought to withdraw into the hills and valleys, tending to his parents above and providing for his family below, content in a single hall. Devoting himself to the Dao through tilling the soil—this, too, is the learning of Yan and Min. But to rush through the clamor of cities, exchanging toasts and courtesies, wearying oneself in vain—how does this compare to the ease of a mulberry-picker?"* Hearing this, Panshanzi immediately moved his family into Pangu Valley, where he guarded his person and nurtured his body. His household affairs prospered, and he at last believed the master’s discourse on principle to be as responsive as drum to drumstick.

In the summer of the *jiawu* year, the *guoyi* bandits emerged from Dabao Fortress, burning and plundering villages. A girl of the Ding family, along with her younger brother, was captured. The bandits, taking pity on them, untied their bonds, intending to coerce them. The girl cursed them fiercely and refused to submit; seizing an opportunity, she threw herself into the river and perished. Earlier, when the bandits had first come, her father had drowned while fording the river, and her mother had also drowned—yet the girl had carried her mother’s corpse from the water. Her brother, held captive for three years, later escaped and returned to Lengqi, where he tearfully recounted the events. Prefect Xu Zhiyuan ordered the local gentry to publicize her story. The disciples in the mountains begged the master to compose an inscription, and he immediately wrote:

*"Ding Changying, a woman of heroic resolve,
When bandits from Dabao raided her village,
She held fast, refused dishonor, and drowned herself in the river,
Dying while clutching her mother’s corpse from the waters."*

After inscribing this, he added: *"This woman shall one day share eternal honor with the most steadfast of the chaste and loyal."*

Five years later, in Jiazhou, there was a woman of the Li-Wei clan. After her husband’s death, she maintained her chastity; then her mother-in-law passed away, followed by her father-in-law, who, impoverished, could not sustain himself. She returned to her natal family, the Weis, where she spun and wove to support her father while also caring for her father-in-law. She resolved to fulfill her duties of chastity and filial piety before becoming a Daoist nun. When her father fell gravely ill, fearing he would die at any moment and leave her with no refuge, he arranged through a matchmaker for her to remarry into the Song family. Upon hearing this, she wept bitterly and forced herself to say to her father: *"Tomorrow, I shall go to Li Lang’s grave to bid him farewell."* Her father consented. At dawn, she rode in a sedan chair beyond the western gate. Midway, she deceived the bearers: *"I am going to visit relatives behind the mountain. Here is a hairpin—take it back to my family, and you may exchange it for your fare."* Once she saw they were far off, she rushed to Guanyin Shoal and leapt into the river to preserve her chastity.

At the time, Magistrate Mao Huifeng of Leyi, hearing of this, prayed to the river deities to protect and preserve her body. The next day, her corpse was recovered at a Daoist abbey, her countenance as if still living. She was then buried alongside her husband’s son. Furthermore, a petition was made for official commendation, and a shrine was built, with the heroic Ding woman enshrined within. Only then did the disciples of Yun Tan believe that the master’s earlier inscription for Ding Changying had not been in vain.

**The Transmission of Master Sanfeng**

Sanfeng was a native of Yibei Liaoyang in Yizhou. His surname was Zhang, given name Junshi, courtesy name Xuanxuan, and sobriquet Sanfeng. He was enfeoffed as *"Permeating the Subtle, Manifesting Transformation Perfected Person."* He lived during the late Yuan dynasty.

The master’s father was named Zhang Chang, also called Zi’an. Sanfeng was his fifth son. In his youth, he suffered from an eye ailment that no medicine could cure. Thus, he was sent to Bile Palace, where he became a disciple of Zhang Yun’an, studying the Orthodox Unity teachings of the Complete Perfection tradition.

From birth, his master had possessed an extraordinary constitution—tortoise-shaped, crane-boned, with large ears, round eyes, and a beard like halberds. His topknot was bound into a single coil, and he sometimes wore a crescent moon cap. In his hand, he carried a bamboo staff, donning a single bamboo hat and a patched robe through winter and summer alike. Unconcerned with his appearance, people called him *"Zhang the Unkempt."* He could walk a thousand *li* in a day; when still, he would close his eyes in meditation. He might go ten days without eating, yet in a single morning consume a *sheng* or *dou* of grain, or abstain from food for days without discomfort. In truthful stillness, he was untouched by even a speck of worldly dust. Though he vowed to pursue the Great Dao, he did not achieve it. Instead, he wandered lakes and seas, eventually settling at Jintai Abbey in Baoji.

One day, he suddenly bid farewell to the world, leaving behind a verse before departing. His neighbor, Yang Guishan, prepared his coffin and completed the burial. As the coffin was being interred, a thunderous roar erupted from within. The crowd, terrified, opened it to find his complexion as if alive. Soon after, he revived. He endured hardships, traversing renowned mountains and vast marshes. By chance, in the Zhongnan Mountains of Yong, he encountered the Fire Dragon Master, who transmitted oral instructions, imparted secret wonders, and taught him to roam freely—blending his light, merging with the dust, seeking companions in Yue, and refining lead in Shen. Thus, his inner and outer elixirs were completed.

Thereafter, he journeyed through famous sites. On Wudang Mountain in Chu, he cultivated and refined himself, building a hut beneath an ancient grove before the Jade Void Palace. After nine cycles of the golden elixir, he attained the Great Dao. Fierce beasts did not startle him, and birds of prey did not snatch at him—people always marveled at this. He once told the locals: *"This mountain shall one day achieve great prominence."* After residing there for twenty-three years, he brushed his sleeves and departed.

He once entered Shu, where traces of immortals still lingered in its famous mountains. He was skilled at writing in "dragon-and-snake" cursive script, which the people of Shu treasured to this day. By the tenth year of the Yongle era, the emperor ordered Sun Biyun of the Orthodox Unity tradition to build palaces on Wudang Mountain and await his arrival. During the Tianshun era, he was posthumously honored as *"Permeating the Subtle, Manifesting Transformation Perfected Person."*

From then on, he appeared and vanished unpredictably, guiding countless souls, and none knew his ultimate fate. His writings, including *The Essential Chapters* and *Partridge Sky* lyrics, circulated in the world, expounding the applications of Daoism and the methods of attaining perfection.

The inner and outer alchemical classics—*Nei Wai Dan Jing*—are profoundly subtle in their phrasing. From ancient times, Wei Boyang’s *Triple Concordance*, Master Cui’s *Mirror for Entering the Medicine*, and Patriarch Lü’s *Knocking on the Hexagrams* have all embodied the ultimate principles of transcending the mundane and attaining sagehood. Yet their meanings are so refined and recondite that even after poring over ten thousand scrolls, one cannot grasp their essence. Only Master Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* elucidates the legacy of the ancestral masters in detail, yet even this cannot be swiftly comprehended. Alone among them, Master Sanfeng’s *Essential Chapters* is clear and precise, its oral instructions manifest, enabling later learners to achieve sudden enlightenment at a single glance.

It is this work that illuminates the true path of return and restoration, serves as the bridge and vessel for the mysterious lineage, clarifies the dual cultivation of nature and life, harmonizes the pairing of yin and yang, delivers the deluded masses, and bestows blessings upon all beings. It ensures the eternal transmission of the Supreme Dao without decline, reopening the gateway to the profound and wondrous—"mysterious and yet more mysterious, the gate of all subtleties"—in our present age. Moreover, it vigorously refutes heterodox schools and external paths, expunging falsehoods and upholding orthodoxy, guiding those of steadfast resolve and diligent practice away from straying onto errant paths, so they may attain swift results. Such is the compassion of the Perfected One, whose merit and virtue are beyond reckoning.

**Preface to the *Profound Essentials* Engraved at Xiangyun Cave Heaven by Wu Zhen:**
This book was transmitted by Ancestral Master Zhang Sanfeng. It extracts the profound mysteries of the Dao and distills its marrow, serving as the primordial secret and the true aim of Daoist cultivation for all ages. Some have mistakenly claimed it teaches the arts of "bedchamber techniques," a calumny most egregious. Yet one cannot fault them, for such slander arises from ignorance. During the Liu-Song dynasty, there was a certain Zhang Shanfeng who propagated the techniques of "bedchamber arts and essence absorption." Uncritical listeners conflated "Shanfeng" with "Sanfeng," thereby slandering the latter with such practices. This stems from careless minds and a penchant for idle speculation, failing to closely examine the book’s intent. Does not the *Discourse on the Golden Elixir* within it state: *"Those who take this for bedchamber arts are like one who dons hemp to fight fire or a moth that hurls itself into a flame"*? Upon careful review, such misguided criticism is readily refuted.

Through years of arduous study, we—Lingji and Lingmi—have painstakingly explored and collated these texts. Though we dare not claim to have plumbed their deepest recesses, we have, with no small delight, grasped two or three of their fundamental principles and sequences. We have traversed the fence but dare not grow complacent or idle; rather, we remain earnest and humble, seeking guidance from many quarters. The secrets of external alchemy, however, remain elusive.

This book has long lacked a printed edition, and hand-copied versions are rife with errors—transpositions of characters, decay, and illegibility. Thus, we now commit it to the engraver’s block to ensure its enduring transmission. May those of aspiration not lose their way, and may the wish of Ancestral Master Ziyang—*"ten thousand people, one character; ten thousand people, one character"*—be fulfilled, even if only in part. The spirit of the Ancestral Master in heaven must surely be guiding us in silence.

*Respectfully inscribed by Daoist disciples Zhang Lingji and Deng Lingmi after ritual ablutions.*

**Preface by Yueyun Altar**
Master Zhang Zi Qiong of Kunyang was one of boundless compassion, universally delivering all beings. When he encountered Confucians, he spoke of Confucianism; with Buddhists, he spoke of Buddhism; with Daoists, he spoke of the Dao. In matters of the Dao, he taught celestial immortality to those of great capacity, terrestrial immortality to those of middling capacity, and human immortality to those of lesser capacity. In matters of humanity, he expounded the practice of the Dao to the superior, karmic retribution to the average, and moral consequences to the inferior. His teachings were undifferentiated in form, yet he tailored his instruction to each individual’s aptitude. His aspiration was to guide every being in the world toward fulfillment—how vast was his vow to perpetuate the ancestral legacy!

**Preface to the Annotated *Lyrics of the Rootless Tree***

The *Awakening to Reality* of Tiantai elucidates the great matter of the return and restoration of the inner and outer elixirs. Yet in its time, those of shallow understanding and ignorance mistook it for a text on furnace-fire or sexual arts. Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp the principle of return, further appended superficial discourses on purity and stillness, riding its fame into circulation. Weng Baoguang, upon reading it, laughed and said, *"This is one who knows nothing of the Golden Elixir."* He then composed annotations to correct its errors. Lu Ziye and Chen Shangyang subsequently expanded upon it, and with the emergence of the *Three Commentaries on Awakening to Reality*, Ye’s notes faded into obscurity.

Master Zhang Sanfeng of Liaoyang was a celestial immortal. During his time in Wudang, he composed *Twenty-Four Daoist Songs of the Rootless Tree*, a work peerless with Zhang Boduan’s *Awakening to Reality*, though the world likewise misconstrued it as pertaining to sexual or furnace-fire practices. Hanxu sighed and said, *"The Dao does not spread because the Dao is not understood."* He longed to compose an exegesis to clarify it but lamented the absence of like-minded alchemical companions.

Liu Wuyuan of Qiyun, endowed with vast and penetrating eloquence, authored dozens of works transmitted to the world. Among them was his *Annotations on the Rootless Tree*. Hanxu obtained and examined it, finding its diction expansive and its principles perfectly comprehensive. Overjoyed, he exclaimed, *"He has anticipated what my heart already affirmed!"* Where Liu’s work left some matters unexhausted, Hanxu supplemented them, revealing in full the inner and outer medicines, the fire-phases of return, and the sequence of furnaces and crucibles. Thus, the *Two Exegeses on the Rootless Tree* stand as the *Three Commentaries on Awakening to Reality* do. Upon completing the work, he asked me to write a preface. Though unworthy, I record here the depth of his devotion.

*Respectfully inscribed by Qingxia Cave Master, with fellow disciple He Xifu, on the day of the Beginning of Autumn in the year Dingwei*

**Two Lyrics on the *Rootless Tree* (To the Tune of *Partridge Sky*)**

The transmission of the Dao’s methods knows true and deviant paths;
Those who stray from the true and embrace the deviant wander the earth.
Rarely seen is the phoenix soaring through the clouds,
While many, sunk in delusion, become frogs at the bottom of a well.
It is no difficult task to distinguish the clamor of chaos—
They mistake red earth for cinnabar.
To know the authentic path that penetrates the mysteries,
Study closely the blossoms beneath the *Rootless Tree*.

**Selling Flowers’ Cry**
Beneath the *Rootless Tree*, the eternal constant is expounded;
The six realms of sentient beings share a single light.
When you comprehend the affairs before and after *Vairocana’s* voice,
You see that fundamentally there is no coming or going—your bearing is majestic.

In the year *Jiazi* of the *Hongwu* reign’s seventeenth year, on the *Zhonghe* Festival, the remnant elder of the Great Yuan, Zhang Sanfeng, recorded this at the thatched hut of Mount Wudang’s Heavenly Pillar Peak.

**Lineage of the Perfected Zhang Sanfeng**
The Perfected was a native of Yizhou in Liaodong, surnamed Zhang, given name Junshi, style Yuanyuan, sobriquet Sanfengzi, also known as Kunyang. Some say his surname was Zhang, given name Zheng, style Junbao, sobriquet Yuanyuanzi. He lived at the end of the Song dynasty. Born with extraordinary qualities, his form resembled a tortoise, his bones those of a crane; he had large ears and round eyes. Standing over seven feet tall, his beard was long and bristling like a halberd, his topknot bound into a single coil, and he often wore a crescent-shaped cap. Clad in a single bamboo hat and patched robe, he endured both cold and heat without change. Neglecting his appearance, people called him "Zhang the Slovenly." He could consume a *sheng* or *dou* of food at a meal, yet at times would abstain from grain for months, remaining at ease.

During the Yanyou era, at the age of sixty-seven, he entered the southern reaches of Mount Song and encountered Lü Chunyang and Zheng Huolong, from whom he received the essential teachings of the Golden Elixir and cultivated the Dao to fruition. Some say he entered Mount Zhongnan and received transmission from the Fire Dragon Perfected, through which he cultivated the Dao to completion.

A fisherman of the Qinhuai, Shen Wanshan—also known as Wan San—was fond of virtue and delighted in almsgiving, yet constrained by poverty, he could not fulfill his aspirations. The Perfected One transmitted to him the art of transmuting stone into gold, thereby realizing his wishes. Wan San styled himself the "Daoist of Three Mountains," and his elixir chamber bore a couplet: *"Eight hundred fire-oxen plow the moonlit night; / Three thousand beauties laugh in the spring breeze."* The world called him the "Basin of Gathered Treasures," and Three Mountains Street in the southwest of the city was his former residence.

At the end of the Yuan dynasty, the Perfected One resided at Jintai Abbey in Baoji. In the ninth month of the *bingwu* year of the Zhizheng era, on the twentieth day, he declared his departure from the world, left a verse, and passed away. The scholar and commoner Yang Guishan prepared a coffin and completed the encoffining, but as the burial was about to commence, he revived—by then, he was one hundred and thirty years old.

Thereafter, he entered Shu and arrived at Mount Taihe, where he built a thatched hut at Jade Void Hermitage. Before the hermitage stood five ancient trees, beneath which he often perched. Fierce beasts did no harm, and birds of prey did not strike; all who witnessed this were astonished.

When asked about immortal arts, he would never answer; when asked about classics, he would discourse tirelessly. Once, he said to the villagers of Wudang, "This mountain shall one day achieve great renown." Later, during the Yongle era, the emperor ordered the restoration of Wudang. The Perfected One concealed himself among the laborers, toiling diligently, yet none recognized him—only Sun Biyun, the Perfected One of Azure Clouds, knew him well. At the time, Biyun served as the abbot of Wudang Mountain, and through their exchanges, he received much benefit from the Perfected One. The Perfected One’s name had reached the celestial court, and though the emperor repeatedly sent envoys to summon him, he never complied, only entrusting poems and lyrics to Biyun to present on his behalf. Later, he transmitted the Dao to the Daoist Yuan Jing and vanished without a trace.

**The Yongle Emperor’s Letter in Reverence of [Zhang] Sanfeng**

With utmost reverence, the Emperor addresses the True Immortal, Master Zhang Sanfeng:

For long have I admired the True Immortal, yearning to personally receive your guidance and example. I have dispatched envoys bearing incense and letters, earnestly inviting you from every renowned mountain. The True Immortal’s virtue and power are lofty, transcending all existence, harmonizing with nature, and attaining unfathomable mystery. Though my talents are meager and my virtue shallow, my sincere desire to meet you has never waned, day or night. With profound respect, I once more send envoys, bearing incense and this letter, humbly awaiting the arrival of your dragon carriage and phoenix chariot. May you graciously come, fulfilling my earnest and unwavering admiration.

Respectfully presented.

**Zhang Sanfeng’s Poetic Reply Entrusted to Sun Biyun for Presentation**

The sacred master’s oral instructions,
A luminous method bequeathed for ages.
Passed to the people of this world,
How many truly comprehend?

When clothes tear, patch them with cloth;
When trees wither, nourish them with earth.
When a person declines, what can restore them?
The mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.

Draw forth the treasure from Kan’s depths,
A golden flower reveals a single branch.
Auspicious clouds unfold across the heavens,
Propitious light fills the realm of death.

Returning, one is dull and silent,
Like one drunk or lost in stupor.
The Great Elixir, like a grain of millet,
Sheds its husk to realize non-action.

Roaming freely through heaven and earth’s expanse,
All phenomena become a pearl in the palm.
Whoever consumes this medicine
Shall live as long as heaven and earth.
If it fails to extend life,
Then all my words are false.

The Golden Elixir weighs one *jin*,
Close your eyes and silently preserve the spirit.
It is found within your own home—
Why seek it elsewhere?

Refine the mercury of the Departing Maiden,
Consume the essence of the Kan Man.
The Golden Elixir and the firing times,
Each word is the primordial sound.

**Annotations on the Venerable Master Zhang Sanfeng’s *Lyrics of the Rootless Tree***

**Liu Wuyuan of Yunqi Mountain, notes**
**Li Hanxu of Changyi Mountain, expanded explanations**

**[Liu’s Notes]**
*The Rootless Tree* is the title of these lyrics. All trees require roots to grow; without roots, they cannot endure. Human life in this world—birth, aging, illness, death—appears and vanishes in an instant. A century passes like a spark or lightning flash, much like a rootless tree. The Immortal Elder’s twenty-four lyrics, titled *The Rootless Tree*, awaken the world, urging people to see through the illusory dream of floating life and swiftly cultivate their nature and destiny.

**[Li’s Explanations]**
*The Rootless Tree* refers to the *qi* of the human body. All the body’s meridians arise from *qi*, which itself emerges from the realm of emptiness and nothingness—hence, "rootless." The alchemist nurtures roots within this empty realm, where both pre-heavenly and post-heavenly *qi* arise from nothingness. Thus, the rootless is the origin of the rooted. Those refining the post-heavenly must enter nothingness to seek being, then merge being into nothingness; those refining the pre-heavenly must merge being into nothingness, then return from nothingness to being. Such is the cultivation of the root’s cause. However, the *qi* of the human body differs in youth, prime, and old age, just as the *qi* of refinement varies in the early, middle, and late stages. The twenty-four chapters correspond to the year’s seasons, all urging one to observe the flowers beneath the rootless tree in due time—this is the perfection of the Dao’s sentiment.

**1.**
**[Liu’s Note]** Lamenting the world.
**[Li’s Note]** Urging people to nurture the hidden flower.

The rootless tree,
Its flowers deeply secluded—
Who would cease their craving for glory and splendor?
The affairs of floating life,
A boat upon the sea of suffering,
Tossed to and fro without freedom.
No shore, no bounds, no place to moor,
Ever drifting through perilous waters of fish and dragons.
If one turns their head,
There lies the shore—
Do not wait for the storm to wreck your boat.

**[Wu Yuan’s Note]** "I do not know to what tune this belongs."
**[Hanxu’s Note]** "Those who sing *Daoist sentiments* call it *Pulling Back the Black Clouds*."

**[Liu’s Notes]**
Flowers are the radiant essence of the tree.

The human body is like a tree, and the human true spirit is like the tree’s flower. All trees have roots, thus they can grow and bloom. Only the human body has no root—life and death are impermanent, wholly dependent on the movement of that single point of true spirit’s qi. When the true spirit flourishes, the body endures and lives; when the true spirit decays, the body perishes and dies. Human survival or demise, life or death, rests entirely on the flourishing or decay of this true spirit. Though it is the flower of the human tree, it is in truth the root of the human tree.

Master Yuyang called this true spirit the "Yellow Sprout"; Master Boyang called it the "Golden Flower"; Master Chunyang called it the "Spiritual Root"; Master Ziyang called it "True Gold"; Yaofu called it the "Heavenly Root"; the Immortal Elder called it "Golden Essence." The various alchemical classics also refer to this true spirit as the "Primordial Unity Qi." Though its names are manifold, they all describe this one thing.

This thing is born of the Primordial, concealed within the Later Heaven. It positions Heaven and Earth, governs yin and yang, moves the Five Phases, and nurtures the myriad things. Vast, it has no exterior; minute, it has no interior. Released, it fills the Six Directions; gathered, it retreats into secrecy.

In terms of its essence: in Confucianism, it is called the Supreme Ultimate; in Daoism, the Golden Elixir; in Buddhism, Perfect Enlightenment. In terms of its function: in Confucianism, it is called Illustrious Virtue, the Heart-Mind of Heaven and Earth; in Daoism, the Numinous Treasure, the Mysterious Pearl of Millet; in Buddhism, the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye, the Wondrous Heart of Nirvana.

The human true spirit is originally round and complete, radiant and luminous, pure and bare, unadorned and free—neither born nor destroyed, neither form nor emptiness. In the sage, it does not increase; in the ordinary person, it does not diminish. Yet through interaction with the Later Heaven, the common people lose it, while the noble person preserves it—thus arises the distinction between sage and ordinary.

The common people lose it by forsaking this true spirit and pursuing the false spirit. The noble person preserves it by retaining this true spirit and not chasing the false spirit. Because the common people cling to the false spirit, the true spirit becomes dim and obscure. Following their desires, they crave glory and splendor, vie for fame and profit, never ceasing. Mistaking the false for the true, a hundred worries disturb their hearts, ten thousand affairs weary their forms—like a boat upon the sea of suffering, tossed to and fro, ever drifting through the perilous waters of fish and dragons.

If one can suddenly awaken and turn back, they instantly transcend to the other shore. Do not wait for the storm to wreck your boat and lose your life. Once the human form is lost, escape is impossible for ten thousand kalpas.

**Li’s Exegesis**

For years, this mountain dweller has secluded himself beneath the *Rootless Tree*, ever desiring to expound its profound mysteries and summon those of like kind. One day, strolling through the mountain garden, I beheld the serene seclusion of flowers and trees, their natural abundance overflowing—suddenly grasping that this character *you* (幽, "seclusion") is the wellspring from which the twenty-four chapters of the *Rootless Tree* arise. *You* means depth, the realm of emptiness and nothingness. All such realms of emptiness are the sacred precincts where Daoists cultivate flowers and trees. Thus, my mountain teacher inscribed upon the *Bamboo-Embracing Studio*:

*"Three paths of secluded blossoms, fragrance at ease,*
*Four gardens of cultivated bamboo, shadows intertwined."*

How wondrous these words, harmonizing perfectly with this truth! Without deep seclusion, flowers cannot exude their fragrance freely; amidst the red dust of worldly affairs, peace is unattainable day or night. As for *"shadows intertwined"*—this is the hollow heart and tranquil *qi* depending upon one another, whereby one’s *qi* nourishes the heart, and the heart nourishes the *qi*. When *qi* flourishes and principle abounds, the heart is at peace and the spirit whole, preserving one’s true nature and containing one’s numinous essence.

Wu Yuan was right to take *"true spirit"* as the root and flower of the human tree. The *true spirit* is true knowing and numinous knowing. Numinous knowing pertains to *yin* nature, true knowing to *yang* emotion. When nature and emotion remain uncorrupted, the true spirit is complete. Yet alas, the seven emotions and six desires erode and deplete it, inwardly damaging one’s nature and outwardly harming one’s emotions—until the true spirit vanishes. With the true spirit gone, the tree has no flower, no root.

Wu Yuan’s essential meaning is thus. Yet I have more to say: flowers grow from the tree, the tree from the root, the root from nothingness. The essence of the true spirit is indeed conceived within the womb of emptiness—hence the phrase *"the flower is truly secluded."* This conception within emptiness is none other than humanity’s primordial wisdom, the *empty numinosity* within each person—formless and traceless, yet containing all principles and responding to all affairs. Sages and worthies employ it with abundance, immortals and buddhas cultivate it to perfection, but it must never be entangled with emotions and desires. Once entangled, one daily extracts *being* from *non-being* to meet worldly needs, and in daily extracting *being*, one daily loses *non-being*. In daily losing *non-being*, one daily loses the root; losing the root, one loses the tree; losing the tree, one loses the flower. The common saying goes: *"When people grow old, they go senile; when trees grow old, their hearts hollow."* Wisdom is exhausted, empty numinosity scattered—where then is the true spirit?

All this comes from clinging to glory and splendor, refusing to rest, daily engaging in the affairs of fleeting life. They never consider that a hundred years pass in an instant, that upon death all matters are abandoned, and the body sits in the boat upon the sea of suffering. Nor do they consider that when impermanence strikes, the nature sinks with the capsized boat—boundless and shore-less, mooring and anchorage lost. Drifting and wandering through the perilous waters of fish and dragons, they rush about in endless toil, vainly wounding their wisdom and shackling their empty numinosity. What benefit is there in this?

The Immortal Master, moved by profound compassion, steers the compassionate vessel to ferry them, saying: The reason worldly people sink deeply into the sea of suffering and struggle to escape is simply that they refuse to turn back and do not recognize the shore. If they would but turn back, that is the shore. The shore is the path of awakening. Those who ascend this path find wisdom restored, empty numinosity enduring, past errors amendable, and future truths still attainable. Though spirit and *qi* may have declined, there is still a way to return. Do not wait until the storm’s surging waves shatter your boat—only then may the boat and its passenger be preserved, serving as provisions for the other shore and aid in emerging from the abyss.

**Liu’s Note:** Exhort the diligent learner.
**Li’s Note:** Urge people to graft and cultivate.

*The Rootless Tree, its flower now faint,*
*The aged tree must graft fresh branches anew.*
*Plum on willow, mulberry on pear—*
*Pass this on as a model for those who cultivate the truth.*
*Since ancient times, immortals have had their grafting methods;*
*When people grow old, there is medicine to heal them.*
*Seek a wise teacher, inquire of the method—*
*Begin swiftly, for even then it may be too late.*

Wu Yuan’s annotated edition renders *wei* (微) as *wei* (危, "perilous"), which also aligns with the sense of decline. **Liu’s Commentary:** Many doubt that when old age arrives and vitality wanes, the spirit is limited—like a tree’s flower withering in peril, unable to return to its origin or restore its root. Thus, they abandon themselves to despair, awaiting death. Yet observe how in the world, old trees grafted with tender branches flourish anew—plum on willow, mulberry on pear. These are inanimate things, yet they can revive. How much more so for humans, the most numinous of all beings, endowed with heaven and earth’s upright *qi*? Can the old truly lack medicine to heal them? What is this healing medicine? It is the method of grafting in old age. To know this method, hasten to seek a wise teacher and inquire of the true formula. Once obtained, begin swiftly—for even then it may be too late.

**Li’s Exegesis:** *Wei* means decline. When people grow old, their primordial *qi* declines, and they must urgently graft and replenish. Observe the examples of plum on willow and mulberry on pear—these serve as models. *Ji* ("to lodge") corresponds to the alchemical method of dwelling in the *dui* trigram’s gate or lodging in the western neighbor’s body; *jie* ("to graft") corresponds to the alchemical method of joining nature with life or oneself with another. Thus, plum on willow and mulberry on pear are precisely the models for modern truth-cultivators and the grafting methods of ancient immortals. Grafting is the medicine for old age.

The method of grafting trees has its fine techniques. Speaking of plum, willow, mulberry, and pear, these are of the same kind. When grafting, split the old branch, insert the tender shoot, bind and secure it, pack it with good soil, and let *yin* and *yang* interlock—this is the method of grafting trees. The medicine for old age must likewise employ like with like, blending with wondrous soil, only then can one return to youth and restore the origin. This method is known to wise teachers—it remains for people to seek them out.

Swift cultivation may still be too slow, for time waits for no one—impermanence arrives in an instant, and if one’s nature remains unenlightened while life remains unestablished, one strays into the vast and desolate realm of ghosts. Immortal He the Maiden said: *"In the Gardens of Lang, peach trees bear drooping willow branches; on Fusang’s boughs, intertwined pears take form—this is the alchemical method revealed by the Eastern King and the Queen Mother of the West."* The words of Zhang Sanfeng are not without foundation.

Further, as Liu observes, the work of refining the self. As Li notes, the marvel of flowers and willows. *"The rootless tree, its blossoms fresh and green—flower-wine immortals from ancient times to now. In the brothel’s den, the meat-and-wine grove, one neither shuns flesh nor transgresses lust. To transgress lust is to lose the treasure of long life; meat and wine pass through the gut, yet the Dao abides in the heart. Open the gate and I shall tell you: without flowers and wine, the Dao cannot be achieved."*

In Wu Yuan’s annotated edition, *"green"* is rendered as *"pure,"* yet *"green"* signifies the freshness of new growth, akin to purity untainted. Liu comments: The path of the Golden Elixir takes absolute purity—utterly free of dross—as its destination. Yet to attain such purity, one must first emerge from the depths of turbidity. Only by remaining unstained amid the deepest murk does true purity arise. Thus it is said: *"The rootless tree, its blossoms pure—flower-wine immortals from ancient times to now."*

How can one see that flowers and wine may forge immortality? The brothel’s den and the meat-and-wine grove are the very snares that beguile mortals. Yet if one can perceive color without being ensnared by it, resisting the allure of sensual pleasures, and if one can wander through the grove of wine and meat without being burdened by them—neither abstaining from flesh nor indulging in lust—then the appetites of food and desire are transformed. The heart of the Dao remains constant, the human heart fades away, the true spirit suffers no harm, and the great Dao may be attained.

When it says *"not abstaining from flesh,"* it does not mean clinging to it, but rather letting meat and wine pass through the body while the heart remains untroubled. To refrain from lust is to have no brothel in the heart; to consume meat and wine is to have no wine or meat in the heart. Without the brothel in the heart, the immortal blossom of long life naturally blooms; without wine and meat in the heart, the wine of extended life naturally flows. With the immortal blossom and immortal wine, one arrives at the realm of pure truth. Those in the world who shun brothels and avoid meat and wine—how could they know that immortals emerge from the midst of mortal flowers and wine? How could they know that without flowers and wine, the Dao cannot be achieved?

The *"Song of Knocking on the Hexagrams"* says: *"Wine is a good friend, flowers a companion; seek the true person in the willow lanes and flower streets—the true person is found only in the play of flowers."* This harmonizes with the marvel of *"blossoms pure."*

Li explains: The appetites for food and desire weigh heaviest upon mortals. Immortal Zhang Sanfeng used flowers and wine as metaphors. Many crave flowers and wine, but who knows of the flower-wine immortals? The primordial *qi* within the body is fresh and verdant. If one can consume it, harness it, drink it, and adorn oneself with it, the spirit becomes clear and the *qi* invigorated—this is the flower-wine immortal, present from ancient times to now. Yet this is not the brothel’s den or the meat-and-wine grove of the world.

Brothels and wine-meat dull the spirit; the *qi* of meat and wine is turbid, and brothels stir lust. Both are harmful, but lust is the greater danger. Those who refine themselves well eat when they encounter food, without seeking more, so they do not abstain from flesh yet forget it entirely. They see color as no-color, do not cling to beauty, and thus do not transgress lust, for lust is extinguished. Otherwise, essence scatters and fluids leak, causing no small harm. As the *Yellow Court Classic* says: *"Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdant hue; only by sealing and guarding the light can one attain lasting peace."* Thus, to transgress lust is to lose the treasure of long life.

Meat and wine pass through the gut, yet the Dao remains in the heart—how could flowers and wine delude one? It is people who delude themselves with flowers and wine! Seek not mortal flowers and wine, and you will find immortal blossoms and wine. Immortal blossoms and wine aid the attainment of the Dao—they are the fresh, verdant flowers on the rootless tree, rich in flavor and vibrant in hue, most nourishing.

The immortal master opens the gate of the primordial and tells you: without such flowers and wine, the Dao is difficult to achieve.

Further, as Liu says, severing the side doors. As Li laments, solitary cultivation. *"The rootless tree, its blossoms solitary—pray tell, does yin and yang find their kind? The hen’s egg, though laid, cannot hatch a chick, for it has turned its back on the furnace of yin-yang transformation. A woman without a husband is a resentful maiden; a man without a wife is a widowed bachelor. Alas for the deluded, so utterly confused—sitting in stillness, cultivating alone, their qi withers away."*

Liu comments: The path of cultivating truth requires yin and yang to find their kind, only then can the treasure of the true spirit be perfected. If there is yin without yang, or yang without yin, this is a solitary blossom without its counterpart—the true spirit cannot form, just as the hen’s egg cannot hatch a chick. For it has turned its back on the furnace of yin-yang union and transformation. Likewise, a woman without a husband or a man without a wife—how can they bear offspring?

Those blind fools of the world, who do not fathom the principles of yin and yang or trace the source of transformation, muddle through their practice—some contemplating emptiness, some regulating breath, some visualizing spirits, some guarding cavities, some circulating *qi*—all are solitary cultivation in stillness, yin without yang. Not only do they fail to benefit nature and life, but they harm them, growing ever more desiccated with each passing day.

Li explains: *"Solitary"* refers to inner cultivation. Cultivating nature alone cannot establish life, for it is solitary and without a counterpart, failing to give rise to the treasure of life. It is like a hen without a rooster—though it may lay eggs, it cannot hatch chicks. Those today who cultivate nature to nurture *qi* do not realize their *qi* is but solitary yin.

To avoid desiccation, one must pair true yang with true yin—only then are they of the same kind. I ask those who cultivate the Dao: have you attained this pairing? Now, true yang is *yi* (righteousness), and true yin is the Dao. When *yi* and the Dao are paired, they are no longer solitary.

Yet within this lies three layered stages: first, true yin generates true yang; next, true yang pairs with true yin; then, from the intercourse of yin and yang, the true numinous *qi* of vastness is born. How could this be like the hen’s egg, difficult to hatch? Those who cannot hatch the chick have turned their backs on the principle of yin and yang and the furnace of creation.

Yin and yang are husband and wife. The Dao of the sages begins with husband and wife, and through them, the myriad things are transformed and born. The same holds for the men and women of the world. If a woman has no husband, she is solitary yin that cannot give life and becomes a resentful maiden. If a man has no wife, he is solitary yang that cannot be nurtured and becomes a widowed bachelor. This principle is clear and easy to understand, yet the deluded disciples of the world remain utterly confused. They believe that solitary cultivation in stillness can clarify the mind, reveal the nature, and allow one to ascend directly—all while neglecting the pairing of yin and yang. I fear that with each day of sitting and cultivating, they wander the halls of empty nothingness and play in the sea of extinction, until their *qi* grows ever more withered.

**Liu’s Note:** The pairing of yin and yang.
**Li’s Note:** The inversion of yin and yang.

The rootless tree, its flowers askew—
Departed from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.
Gold parted from wood, mercury parted from lead,
Yang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side.

In the world, yin and yang—man paired with woman—
Bear sons and grandsons, generation after generation.
Following the sequence makes one mortal; reversing it, immortal—
The difference lies solely in this inversion.

**Liu’s Commentary:**
The *Book of Changes* states: *"The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao."* The *True Sayings of Awakening* says: *"When yin and yang find their kind, they unite in intercourse; when the two eights correspond, they naturally join in kinship."* If yin and yang are each askew—if yang stirs but yin does not respond, if yin seeks but yang does not beckon, if yang exceeds and yin falls short, or if yang flourishes while yin is deficient—then the flower of true numinosity is askew, neither centered nor upright, and the Dao remains incomplete.

A person’s true passion is like gold, true knowing like lead—both are firm. Numinous nature is like wood, numinous knowing like mercury—both are yielding. True passion and true knowing, firm yet prone to sinking; numinous nature and numinous knowing, yielding yet prone to floating. If nature seeks passion and passion returns to nature, if the true governs the numinous and the numinous returns to the true, then firm and yielding respond, yin and yang harmonize, and they transform into a single *qi*, with life’s mechanism enduring unceasingly.

But if passion does not return to nature, if the numinous does not return to the true, this is what is meant by *"gold parted from wood, mercury parted from lead, yang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side."* How then can one return to the root and revert to the origin, coalescing the elixir of true numinosity? Observe the world: when man and woman pair, they bear sons and grandsons, generation after generation, perpetuating the lineage. Thus, in the Dao of cultivating the true, when yin and yang unite, they give birth to immortals and sages, also perpetuating the lineage without end. The difference lies only in whether one follows the sequence or reverses it—mortals follow, immortals reverse. The distinction rests solely in this inversion.

This *"middle"* is profound in principle and most subtle in practice. It is not the middle between inner and outer, nor the middle of the body’s upper and lower. It is the middle of yin and yang’s intercourse, formless and imageless, called the root of heaven and earth, the cavity of yin and yang, the abode of life and death, the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Birth and death occur here; sagehood and worthiness are determined here; whether one becomes human or beast depends on this. If cultivators can plant their feet firmly here and reverse the flow, then in the space of inversion, calamity transforms into fortune, punishment into virtue. This is what is meant by *"the elixir is completed in a single hour."*

Alas! The *"middle"* is not easily known, and the *"inversion"* is also difficult to comprehend. The sexual arts take the place of man and woman’s union as the *"middle"* and the man’s absorption of the woman’s essence as *"inversion."* The circulation schools take the Yellow Court as the *"middle"* and the ascent of *qi* and descent of blood as *"inversion."* All these are but the beginnings of error—how could they fathom the meaning of the *"middle"* and *"inversion"* in the Dao of immortals? Diligent learners should discern this early.

**Li’s Explanation:**
*"Askew"* refers to yin and yang being parted, unable to complete the elixir. When yin and yang unite in the middle, the knife and spoon congeal, and the Dao’s arts are fully realized. Gold and wood, lead and mercury—these are yin and yang. The essence of wood and the nature of mercury belong to yin; the *qi* of gold and the passion of lead belong to yang. Essence and *qi* depend on each other, nature and passion unite in intercourse. Gold cherishes wood’s benevolence, wood loves gold’s righteousness; mercury goes forth to welcome lead, lead comes to join mercury. Only then is there no illness of separation, and the great medicine’s true body is born.

If yin is solitary and yang widowed, each to one side, then yin and yang do not pair, remaining askew and incomplete. How can they transform and give life to the utmost reality, perpetuating it for ten thousand generations? The method of pairing is similar for immortals and mortals—only mortals use the sequence, while immortals use the reverse.

Master Wu Yuan said that the *"middle"* and *"inversion"* are beyond people’s understanding; I say that even the *"reverse"* is unknown to them. To grasp the *"middle"* and *"inversion,"* one must first know the wondrous use of *"reverse."* If one knows *"reverse,"* then gold, wood, lead, and mercury are all within it, yin and yang, *qian* and *kun* are entirely inverted, and all events revolve within the *"reverse."* The medicine is obtained, the elixir returned—success may be expected in an instant.

**Liu’s Note:** When the medicine is born.
**Li’s Note:** The principle of *kun* and *shen.*

The rootless tree, its flowers renewed,
Born in the *kun* direction—*kun* is the person.

Pluck the flower and wear it, gather the flower’s heart,
Layer upon layer, its pistils glow with spring’s radiance.
The world does not fathom the principle within the flower—
A single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.

Borrow the flower’s name, embody the flower’s form,
Each line of the *"Knocking on Hexagrams"* speaks truly.

**Liu’s Note:** *"New"* refers to the original substance long buried, suddenly reappearing. When the flower is renewed, its brilliance revives. Like the moon emerging in the southwest *kun* direction, beneath pure yin, a speck of subtle yang unfurls—akin to emptiness giving birth to light, the true spirit revealed, the original face restored. This original face is the undying true person within me. With this person, one is human; without it, one is not. It is what I receive from heaven to be human. Yet this true person rarely appears, not to be seen at will. Only in utter emptiness and profound stillness, when all conditions are stilled, does a fleeting image arise. Utter emptiness and profound stillness are the image of pure yin in *kun*, hence *"born in the kun direction—kun is the person."* This person has long been buried beneath dust and grime, leaving no trace. Once its image appears, it is the new flower—timing must not be missed. One must swiftly act, plucking and gathering it for oneself. *"Pluck the flower and wear it"* means to pluck the flower of this true person. *"Gather the flower’s heart"* means to gather the heart of this true person. Gradually plucking and gathering, from little to much, accumulating depth and radiating light, the true spirit remains undimmed. Then the flower’s pistils unfold layer by layer, all principles become luminous, following the heart’s intent wherever it leads, every step the Dao. Its splendor is like spring, yang qi spreading across the earth, flowers blooming everywhere. Yet this flower is possessed by all, seen by all, yet none comprehend it. Most let it slip by before their eyes. If one does grasp it, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood happens in an instant—hence *"a single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold."* The immortal elder, in compassion, borrows the flower’s name and embodies its form, now tangible, now intangible. Each line of *"Knocking on Hexagrams"* expounds the subtleties of the primordial, wishing for all to attain the Dao and each to become an immortal. Alas, the world does not fathom the principle within the flower, and some still wildly speculate with misguided practices like *"guiding the woman"* or *"chamber elixirs."* Even the immortal elder can do nothing about this—how lamentable!

**Li’s Explanation:** Master Wu Yuan speaks of the *"person"* as the original face, having once glimpsed this person, his words flow at length and his heart bears deep compassion, seeking to awaken both self and others. Yet the *"is"* in *"kun is the person"* remains obscure. The flower is likened to the person, and the person borrows the flower as metaphor. *"The flower is renewed"* is like a person returning to the root, cultivating emptiness and stillness, observing the solitary yang’s return—unawares, spring’s colors renew. This flower appears in the *kun* direction, meaning *kun* sees the flower, the flower sees the person, where the flower is born is where the person is born—hence *"kun is the person."* In elixir methods, lead is planted in the metal village, mercury sown in the fire land. Metal and fire reside in the southwest; the southwest gains its companion. Where metal and fire unite is precisely above the *kun* direction. This person is a golden body and fiery form, a mass of pure yang—our true qi, also called true emotion. Vague yet distinct, within it lies an image, hot as fire, radiant as a flower. The flower’s fragrance intoxicates like wine—obtaining it is like being drunk. At this moment, one must pluck and wear it without delay. One must further gather its heart, swallowing it whole. From flower to pistil, penetrating layer upon layer, truly it is a spring palace of splendor. The world knows only the exterior, not the interior, and thus cannot grasp the wondrous principle within the flower. The wondrous principle within the flower is pure heavenly mechanism. When the heavenly mechanism flows forth, a single secret is worth ten thousand gold. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh lines here are all from Lü Zu’s *"Knocking on Hexagrams Song."* Master Feng said: *"Lü Zu borrows the flower’s name for the human body and the flower’s form for the person’s form. Each line I use from 'Knocking on Hexagrams' speaks with utmost truth and savor."* **Liu’s Note:** Seize the moment to gather it.

**Li’s Note:** Before the furnace, settle into stillness.

The rootless tree blooms in full profusion,
Fair features and delicate charm outshine powdered faces.
Guard against the monkey and horse, stubborn and unruly—
Raise the iron mask your mother bore.
Draw forth the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon,
Pluck every fresh blossom from the wall’s edge.
Catch the wind’s sail, return fully laden—
How could one pass the mountain of treasure empty-handed?

*"Wall’s edge"* may be rendered *"jade blossoms,"* and *"jade blossoms"* as *"wall’s edge"*—I have seen both. This annotation takes *"wall’s edge"* as more evocative, so I follow it.

**Liu’s Annotation:** When the primordial true spirit shines forth, one root branches into ten thousand forms. Gazing upon images in their season, nothing exists that is not a flower in full bloom. At the height of its flourishing, its splendor is fully revealed, its essence spent outwardly, easily drawn into rivalry and vanity, flaunting its allure. Hence it is said: *"Fair features and delicate charm outshine powdered faces."* At such a time, one must guard against peril and contemplate danger, firmly tether the monkey and horse, raise the iron mask your mother bore, and grasp the treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon. In the face of phenomena, forget emotion, pluck every fresh blossom from the wall’s edge, allowing not the slightest attachment to form or dissipation of true qi.

The *"iron mask your mother bore"* is the unfeeling, unknowing iron visage. The *"treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon"* is the true nature, unstained and unattached. The iron mask your mother bore is the treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon—both emerge from the same source but bear different names. In terms of essence, it is the iron mask your mother bore; in terms of function, it is the treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon. The iron mask is the settled body; the treasure-sword is the instrument of wisdom. Settling gives rise to wisdom; wisdom perfects settling. Settling and wisdom depend on each other, essence and function never parted.

The primordial true spirit is form yet emptiness, ever-responsive yet ever-still, without leakage or loss. This is what is meant by *"pluck every fresh blossom from the wall’s edge."* The blossoms at the wall’s edge have just emerged but not yet left the wall, when true qi has not yet dispersed. Plucking them at this moment leaves no dross, pure as heaven’s truth. Gradually they grow, gradually they are gathered; gradually they are plucked, gradually they are reaped—one must pluck until nothing remains to be plucked.

Alas! The great medicine is hard to encounter; the great method is hard to meet. Fortunate to have met it, the moment must not be missed. Catch the wind’s sail, swiftly gather the fresh blossoms, return fully laden—how could one pass the mountain of treasure empty-handed, only to regret it later?

**[Li’s Exegesis]**
"Abundance" refers to the moment of fullness. The beauty of a fair face and delicate features is likened to the primordial unity of qi—just as the Immortal Elder’s *Five Watches’ Daoist Ballad* says: *"When the host of yin is spent, the radiant yang season arrives, / A branch of spring’s hue, golden blossoms resplendent."* The "powdered-cluster contest" marks the birth of the medicine, the very hour when the Flower Demon vies in beauty. Ancient immortals warned: *"When the primordial appears, the Medicine Demon easily arises."* Without refining the self to utter purity—seeing beauty yet unmoved—who could seize the golden blossom in but half an instant? Thus it is said: *"Guard against the ape and horse, ever more stubborn."* This echoes the *One Branch Flower* ballad: *"Her celestial form, her ten delicate fingers, / Could never stir my intent-horse or heart-ape."* Don the iron mask of your innate face, summon your power of stillness, and *"Let her try—she’ll not sway you in the slightest."* Draw forth the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon, pluck every fresh blossom from the wall’s edge—this aligns with *"Repel the demon horde, / Angrily raise the keen-edged sword of wisdom, / Dare to gather / The blossoms newly emerged beyond the wall."* Wu Yuan equates the iron mask with *ding* (stabilization) and the treasure-sword with *hui* (wisdom), a true connoisseur’s insight. Yet unless *ding* and *hui* arise from self-refinement, they are not true *ding* or true *hui*—useless when the moment demands. The *One Branch Flower* says: *"Moment by moment, guard the intent-horse; / Instant by instant, lock the heart-ape. / Day and night, sleepless, / Refine the self without cease."* Only when you’ve forged yourself into *"a sea of purity, unstained by a single mote"* have you attained true *ding*. Only when you’ve become *"a night-shining pearl, suspended in the void"* have you attained true *ding*.

The "wall’s edge" describes blossoms that have emerged beyond the wall yet remain upon it—these are the "emerged blossoms," where the fire is purest and the timing most precise. Without a master’s transmission, none can comprehend this; without having traversed the path, none can know it. If you recognize the moment the flower-branch emerges beyond the wall and act to gather it, you wield the immortal’s skill. "Plucking every one" means drawing it all in with a single breath, swallowing it whole into your own domain—not the gradual gathering and gradual reaping. Gradual gathering and reaping belong to the later work of nurturing, drawing out, and replenishing. Seizing the wind’s sail, returning fully laden, the four signs converge in the elixir—swiftly set the River Chariot in motion to bear it back. How could one pass the mountain of treasure empty-handed? That mountain is the birthplace of the primordial.

In the alchemical method, what is refined becomes medicine; what is gathered becomes medicine; what is nurtured becomes fire. Yet where there is medicine, there is fire—not the fire of gentle nurturing. This chapter’s annotation rightly interprets the gathering of medicine.

**[Liu’s Exegesis]** Advancing and retreating yin and yang.
**[Li’s Exegesis]** Nurturing and returning the elixir.

*The Rootless Tree, its blossoms in flight—*
*Once shed, they reopen on a fixed date.*
*When the Lead Blossom appears, at the exhaustion of gui,*
*Once more the Western Garden’s branches bloom full.*

*Just as the moon’s waning light was gathered away,*
*Swiftly turn to the morning sun to mend the monk’s robe.*
*This mystery—rarely known in the world—*
*Must be pondered with immortals, in careful detail.*

In Wu Yuan’s annotated edition, *"swiftly turn"* replaces *"again toward,"* differing in word but not in meaning. However, *"just as"* is rendered as *"waning,"* and *"gathering away"* is misconstrued as the removal of the human heart’s selfish desires—thus expelling the thief—leading to a double error.

**[Liu’s Annotation]**
When a person’s spirit declines and true numen dissipates, it is like blossoms scattering and withering. Yet even fallen blossoms have their season of return; so too does the enfeebled person have a path of restoration. What is this path of restoration? It is the path of returning yang within yin, of reopening what has withered. The "Lead Blossom" is the radiance of the Dao-heart’s true knowing. "Gui water" is the selfish desire of the human heart’s guest qi. When the Lead Blossom appears, the Dao-heart remains undimmed; when gui water is exhausted, the human heart abides in stillness. With the Dao-heart undimmed and the human heart still, the original numen suffers no loss or harm—its inherent perfection is restored, and the blossoms, once shed, bloom anew upon the branches.

Because gui water must be exhausted, *"just as the moon’s waning light was gathered away."* Because the Lead Blossom must appear, *"swiftly turn to the morning sun to mend the monk’s robe."* The human heart’s selfish desires are like an intruding guest qi, like the moon’s waning light. The Dao-heart’s true knowing is the original vital qi, like the sun’s radiance. Gathering the waning moonlight sweeps away the human heart’s selfish desires—thus retreating yin. Turning to the morning sun to mend the robe gradually augments the Dao-heart’s true knowing—thus advancing yang. Retreat yin until yin qi is utterly gone—only then is the waning light fully gathered. Advance yang until yang qi is wholly pure—only then is the robe fully mended. With yin exhausted and yang complete, one returns to the origin and restores the root. The original face is fully revealed—how could the promise of reopening after withering be mere words? This celestial mechanism of withering and reopening is scarcely known in the world. To grasp it, one must ponder it with immortals, tracing its beginning and end.

**[Li’s Exegesis]**
Wu Yuan’s annotation is excellent in principle, yet it does not address this chapter’s core meaning. Here, the discussion concerns the nurturing and returning of the elixir. "Flight" signifies ascent and descent—the morning advance of yang fire and the evening retreat of yin tally. "Shedding" refers to the elixir’s attainment, the leaf’s return to the root, precisely denoting the restoration of life. After life is restored, one draws upon the external furnace’s metal-water, extracts lead to replenish mercury, and nurtures the spirit-embryo. As *Awakening to Reality* says: *"The external furnace’s increase and decrease require effort."* As the *Triplex Unity* says: *"Observe and tend with care, / Discern and regulate cold and warmth. / Cycle through the twelve nodes, / And when each is complete, begin anew."* Master Feng says: *"At midnight and noon, focus the fire-tally; / At dawn and dusk, bathe the golden elixir."* Thus it is said: *"They reopen on a fixed date."* Seizing the wind’s sail, returning fully laden—when the four signs converge in the elixir, swiftly set the River Chariot in motion to bear it back. How could one pass the mountain of treasure empty-handed? That mountain is the birthplace of the primordial.

The "reopened" entity refers to the flower branches of the Western Garden mentioned below. When the lead-flower appears at the exhaustion of *gui*, the great medicine of the returned elixir arises after *gui* is born—once lead is born, it must be gathered. Gold, when distant from the full moon, is unfit for consumption; only after the initial surge of *gui*-water on the 5,048th day does one deliberate and apply effort, seizing the foremost treasure of the first meridian—this is the supreme method. *Gui* is born on the fourteenth day and exhausted on the fifteenth, when a single ray of yang light emerges—this is the precise moment. In terms of the human body, it is nothing but the great movement within great stillness. Gather and ingest it, and the returned elixir is formed. Yet once the great elixir is obtained, external lead is born anew, and the alchemist must take it for nurturing purposes, hence the saying: *"Once more, the Western Garden’s branches bloom with flowers."*

*"Just as the moon is faced, it is gathered away"*—this refers to drawing lead. *"Then toward the morning sun, the mendicant’s robe is patched"*—this refers to replenishing mercury. The method of gathering requires clarity on the moon’s waxing and waning, hence the reference to "facing the moon." The method of patching requires the sun’s dawn and dusk, hence the metaphor of "morning sun." Such are the subtle meanings of the mysterious arts. These profound subtleties are rarely known in the world; to understand them, one must seek the meticulous guidance of realized immortals, lest error arise.

**Liu’s Verse:**
The rootless tree, its flowers in full bloom,
Plucked within the crescent-moon furnace.
Prolonging life, dispelling illness and misfortune,
Best to forge good companions and prepare the *dharma-wealth*.

From this, the celestial treasure may be attained—
Let the deluded masses mock my folly.
I urge the worthy: cease your cunning,
Without an enlightened teacher, do not force guesses.

**Liu’s Annotation:**
The treasure of primordial true spirit is formless and imageless, without direction or location—how then is it gathered to form the returned elixir? Though formless and imageless, without direction or location, it too has a time of flowering. When it blooms, within the indistinct arises form; within the profound obscurity, essence appears. This essence is utterly true, containing within it a sign, its symbolic form resembling a crescent moon. Ordinary practitioners, unaware of the ancients’ intent in taking this image, variously misidentify it as the space between the kidneys, the bright hall between the brows, or the stubborn fleshly heart. Even worse, some demonic impostors point to a woman’s birth passage—grievously mistaken!

What is meant by the "crescent moon"? It is the moon in its reclining aspect. In the heavens, on the third day of each lunar month, beneath the dark body of the southwest *kun* earth, the crescent’s light emerges (●), its glow reclining—hence the name "crescent moon." In the hexagrams, it is the faint yang beginning to stir beneath pure yin (☷), forming *Fu* (復). In the human being, it is the movement after extreme stillness, the white arising in an empty chamber, the heart of heaven and earth stirring to life. This heart contains a single point of primordial ancestral *qi*, faintly revealing its traces from the depths of darkness, resembling the light of a crescent moon. Because this single point of ancestral *qi* is the root of heaven and earth, the origin of the five phases, capable of creating immortals and buddhas, sages and worthies, and securing nature and life, it is also called the "crescent-moon furnace."

This heart of heaven and earth aligns its virtue with heaven and earth, its brightness with the sun and moon, its sequence with the four seasons, and its auspices with spirits and deities—rarely encountered, difficult to meet. If one is fortunate enough to chance upon it, the moment must not be missed. One must swiftly act to pluck it, sealing and guarding it carefully to prevent leakage. Thus can life be prolonged and illness and misfortune dispelled. Yet such matters of prolonging life and dispelling misfortune cannot be undertaken by those without great merit and conduct, nor accomplished by those without great resolve and strength. One must externally cultivate good affinities to refine virtue, and internally prepare *dharma-wealth* with sincerity, only then can the imperial ultimate be moved to bestow the celestial treasure.

*Dharma-wealth* is not worldly wealth, but the wealth within the Dao—namely, single-minded devotion, true practice, and unwavering resolve, the *good-wealth* of an undivided mind. As the Perfected One of Upper Yang said: *"If heaven resists, one must seek it with *dharma-wealth* and utmost sincerity. To obtain the celestial treasure, human affairs must be fully exhausted. If human affairs are not exhausted, there is no *dharma-wealth*; without *dharma-wealth*, to vainly desire the celestial treasure is difficult."* How can one seeking the celestial treasure fail to first prepare *dharma-wealth*?

The celestial treasure is no other thing than the golden elixir refined from true spirit, the returned elixir restored to the heart of heaven and earth. Called "true spirit" or "heart of heaven and earth" when speaking of the unrefined state, it is termed "celestial treasure" or "golden elixir" once refined and matured. With the celestial treasure obtained, the ten thousand existences are emptied, root and dust are transformed, and one enters the state of unknowing, without self or others—let the deluded masses mock my folly. This folly requires the oral transmission and mind-to-mind instruction of an enlightened teacher; it cannot be known through forced guesswork. As the immortal elder said: *"I urge the worthy: cease your cunning, / Without an enlightened teacher, do not force guesses."* His warnings to later generations are many.

**Li’s Explanation:**
"Opening" refers to the initial sprouting of the jade bud. The crescent-moon furnace has no fixed location or time within the human body, for it arises with the first stirring of yang *qi*, light within stillness—hence the comparison to the new moon born from extreme darkness. This moon in the heavens has its *geng* direction and its third-day timing, both place and time identifiable. But within the human body, the place it appears is the *geng* direction, the moment it appears is the third day—neither can be predetermined.

What is the form of the crescent moon? It is as depicted in Liu’s diagram. "Crescent" implies both reclining and facing: nine parts dark, one part light, the yang *qi* newly born, thus white light appearing above as a crescent. What people today describe, having such a shape, is a facing moon, not a crescent moon—how then could it be "plucked down"?

Those who speak of "plucking it down" refer to its *qi* being in the void. When alchemists (*dan* practitioners) perceive this single thread of white light, they must not rashly set the *heche* (River Chariot) in motion. Instead, they should employ a spirit of serene detachment and an intention of harmonious equilibrium, gathering it from where the *qi* arises—hence the saying, *"Pluck it down into the reclining-moon crucible."* At the moment when spirit and *qi* unite, suddenly the yang light manifests in full, resembling the full moon of the fifteenth night—this is the Mid-Autumn Moon, the moment when *qi* is abundant and the tide surges. Only then should one drive it along the Yellow Path, escort it to the Yellow Court, whereby longevity may be extended and illness and calamity diminished.

"Good companions and *fa-cai*" refer to those of like mind who cherish the Dao and willingly offer their wealth to protect the Dharma and assist others in attaining the Way. In his commentary on this chapter in *Cultivating Reality*, Wu Yuan mistakenly interprets *fa-cai* as something within the body—this is merely a corrective against greed. Speaking impartially, *fa-cai* has two aspects: the inner *fa-cai*, which is true gold, and the outer *fa-cai*, which is a provisional treasure. Though borrowing the provisional to refine the true is indispensable, one should not covet it excessively. When the Heavenly Treasure is refined, one may feign foolishness and conceal brilliance, holding jade within and bearing uncut gems—though the deluded masses may mock one as a fool, all such matters may be dismissed without concern.

Yet how easily can the Heavenly Treasure be refined! Without an enlightened master, one cannot know its secrets.

**Liu Guan’s verse:**
*The Reverted Elixir ripens to perfection.*

**Li Zhi’s verse:**
*The Reverted Elixir enters the mountains.*
*The rootless tree—its blossoms now full,*
*Bearing fruit, its flavor complete.*
*Like the crimson tangerine, round as a pellet,*
*Guard its embankments, never neglect its care.*
*Learn the method of plants gathering their essence,*
*Return to life, revert to the root, restore the origin.*

**Liu’s commentary:**
The treasure of true numen departs but returns, the old made new again, unharmed and undiminished, restored to its original state—this is the blossom’s fullness. "Fullness" speaks of the fruit’s ripening, its flavor complete. When the Golden Elixir is accomplished, the Five Agents converge, the Four Images harmonize, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust merge into one principle, essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intention return to a single *qi*. Further refined by the firing of the talisman, it transforms into a purely yang substance, vibrant and fluid, red as the crimson tangerine, round as a pellet. At this time, one must guard its embankments, never neglecting its care for even a moment, concealing brilliance and nurturing obscurity. Learn the method of plants gathering their essence, return to life, revert to the root, and restore the origin, awaiting the stillness that gives rise to movement, uniting with the primordial to complete the Great Reversion.

This speaks of the Reverted Elixir’s accomplishment and the subsequent pursuit of the Great Elixir. For the Reverted Elixir merely restores the original substance of the present life—an affair of transcending the mundane, as Lü Zu said: *"With three leads, only one lead is obtained; the golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to take form."* The Great Elixir, however, builds upon the Reverted Elixir to undertake the work of ascent—an affair of entering sagehood, as Lü Zu said: *"Reinstall the furnace, reset the tripod, ride the tiger and mount the dragon to leave the mortal realm."*

If one only refines the Reverted Elixir without further pursuing the Great Elixir, one merely completes the initial stage of the Dao, becoming nothing more than a whole person—how could one enter the realm of the sages? The so-called "selecting a numinous site" and "establishing a Dao hermitage" refer not to external locations but to the numinous site and Dao hermitage within. When cultivation reaches the stage of reverting to the root and restoring life, the work of the Reverted Elixir is complete. Nurturing and warming it, spirit and *qi* become abundant, and the elixir becomes numinous—this is the Numinous Elixir. From this numinous site, reinstall the furnace and reset the tripod—this is establishing the Dao hermitage. "Selecting a numinous site" means awaiting the arising of the first yang. The first yang is the yang born from extreme stillness within the primordial—unlike the Reverted Elixir, which arises from the primordial within the postnatal. Though both are primordial, there is a distinction of before and after. To complete the Great Reversion, one must unite with the yang within the primordial—hence the saying, *"Uniting with the primordial completes the Great Reversion."* Only when the Great Elixir is accomplished does one enter the foundation of sagehood. If the Great Elixir remains unaccomplished, it is but a halfway endeavor, not the full achievement of Dao cultivation.

The Buddhist scriptures say:
*"The unmoving man at the hundred-foot pole—though he has entered, it is not yet true. Advance another step at the hundred-foot pole, and the ten directions become his entire body."*
Does this not refer to the completion of the Great Reversion?

**Li’s explanation:**
"Full" refers to the Reverted Elixir, signifying the unity of nature and emotion. Its method lies in attaining emptiness and guarding stillness. Observing the moon’s arising in the *geng* direction, likened to the first stirring of yang *qi*, one mobilizes one’s mercury to meet it. External contact sparks internal resonance, and internal touch evokes external response—like a magnet attracting iron, it is drawn into the Elixir Field, becoming the External Elixir. This method is supremely simple and easy, as the ancient immortals said: *"It can be accomplished in less than half a watch."*

The Elixir has two grades, which may be divided into three vehicles. The three vehicles of elixir refinement all gather the lead blossom and are called Reverted Elixirs, differing only in scale, sequence, and priority.

The first is the Initial Vehicle, called the Coagulated Elixir, also known as the Jade Liquid Reverted Elixir. Within the postnatal, it returns to the primordial, departing *gui* to take *ren*, nurturing it with jade liquid to round the Internal Elixir—this is the study of fulfilling one’s nature, the Immortal of Human Rank.

The second is the Upper Vehicle, named the Reverted Elixir, also called the Sevenfold Return. Using the primordial returned from the postnatal, it plants the seed of the primordial, establishing the Elixir Mother—this is the study of establishing life, the Immortal of Earth Rank.

The third is the Great Vehicle, named the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Great Reverted Elixir. Its medicine is likened to the full moon of the fifteenth night, primordial within the primordial. When the fire arrives, it moves, transforming into white liquid, which is swallowed into the abdomen and congealed to utmost hardness—this is the Golden Liquid Reverted Elixir, supremely numinous and wondrous, attaining sagehood and becoming a perfected one. This is the study of uniting nature and life, the Immortal of Heaven Rank.

When the flower is perfectly round, this speaks of the foundation of the Upper Vehicle’s elixir. The reckoning has borne one fruit, gathered one harvest—yet in its method of refining lead, the two substances mutually ingest each other, and the Five Phases are all complete. This is called "the fullness of flavor." Though this elixir is not the Great Vehicle’s elixir, it is already radiant as a red tangerine, round and smooth as a pellet. At this stage of practice, one must silently attend to it, continuously preserving it as if it were ever-present. Otherwise, if one’s embrace grows distant, it may easily scatter and be lost. Thus, one must guard and protect the embankment, never allowing the immortal leisure to slip away.

Learn the method of gathering the heads of grasses and trees—what the *Book of Changes* calls "with this, wash the heart and retire to concealment." Returning to life, reverting to the root, and returning to the original source—what the *Cantong Qi* calls "the true dwelling in whiteness, square and round, a mere inch in diameter."

Choose a numinous site and establish a Dao hermitage. Wu Yuan explains that the numinous site and Dao hermitage reside within the human body, yet they also have both inner and outer applications. For the inner numinous site and Dao hermitage, one must seek the purity of the numinous terrace, the harmony of spirit and qi, and therein establish the "Peaceful Hermitage of the Daoist’s Heart." For the outer numinous site and Dao hermitage, one must seek a numinous mountain and blessed land, free from the disturbance of worldly dust, and therein establish the "Thatched Hermitage of the Daoist’s White Clouds." In this way, both the heart and its traces are purified, true power fills to the brim, yang is born within lead, and when gathered and united, the Dao is accomplished in the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Great Reverted Elixir—then the sagely work is complete.

**Liu’s Saying:** The qi of True Unity.
**Li’s Saying:** The place of intercourse.

The rootless tree—its flower flourishes.
Speak of "rootless," yet it has a root.
The three talents’ aperture, the two and five’s essence:
When Heaven and Earth unite, the myriad things are born.
When the sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order.
When man and woman unite, conception begins.
How clear it is—told to you,
Yet still, I fear we may meet and not recognize it as true.

**Liu’s Commentary:**
The treasure of the primordial true numen possesses all principles and responds to the myriad affairs. Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all—nowhere is there obstruction, nowhere does it fail to succeed. This is the flourishing of the flower. Since the flower flourishes, though the tree is rootless, the flower has a root. What root is this? It is the aperture of the three talents that generate Heaven, Earth, and Man, the essence of the wondrous union of yin-yang and the Five Phases. Because it is the aperture of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, it is born prior to Heaven and Earth yet hidden within them. One qi divides into yin and yang, and yin and yang unite to form one qi. Thus, when Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang above and below unite, they merge into one qi and the myriad things are born. When the sun and moon’s yin and yang come and go in union, they merge into one qi and cold and heat follow in order. When man and woman’s yin and yang unite, conception begins. Observing Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, man and woman—only when one yin and one yang unite is there creation. From this, we know that the Dao of nature and life cannot be completed without the union of yin and yang into one. This one qi is the root of nature and life, the aperture of life and death. With this aperture, yin and yang unite and generate life; without this qi, yin and yang turn away from each other and bring death. Human life and death lie solely in the presence or absence of this qi. Yet people do not know what this qi is or where it resides. Some mistake it for the qi of breathing, or circulate it upward and downward in the Yellow Court, or gather it in the Cinnabar Field, or between the brows, or in the Heavenly Valley, or behind the brain—endless strange and bizarre notions, all ultimately leading to emptiness and loss.

What they do not realize is that the primordial qi of True Unity is invisible, inaudible, and intangible. The sage shapes the real into the formless and the existent into the nonexistent. What is real and existent are true yin and true yang; what is formless and nonexistent is the qi of the two eights’ waxing and waning. When these two are shaped, one qi resides in the center, congealing into the elixir—this is the work of the empty void. How can it be guessed at with things of form and image? How can it be made with apertures that have location and direction? Since the immortal elder saw that people did not recognize this one qi, he pointed to the aperture of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, and further illustrated it with the union of Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, man and woman—clearly indicating this one qi to people, only fearing that they might meet it yet fail to recognize it as true.

Wu Yuan, boldly and unafraid of blame, now transmits the immortal elder’s spirit and intent, clearly explaining it to all. Know that the primordial qi of True Unity is no other thing—it is the qi of a single point of true numen. Because this qi is firm, strong, centered, and upright, it is called True Unity; because this qi is easily known and simply capable, it is called true numen. True Unity and true numen, utterly devoid of dross, are thus called primordial things. True Unity and true numen emerge from the same source with different names—they are not two separate things. Does anyone recognize the true?

**Li’s Explanation:**
"Flourishing" means thoroughfare. The thoroughfare of one qi emerges from the word "union" below. Flowers grow on trees, trees grow from roots, and roots grow from nothingness—thus, the rootless has a root. The rootless root is the root that generates Heaven, Earth, and Man. This root is a single aperture of emptiness and nothingness, hence called the aperture of the three talents. This aperture is the place of intercourse, thus it is said, "the three talents’ aperture, the two and five’s essence." The two and five: Heaven’s five is one five, Earth’s ten is another five—thus, the two and five are two earths. When the two earths unite, the "knife-point" elixir is formed. The *Mud Pill* says: "The Mysterious Pass’s one aperture—none recognize it. This is the knife-point elixir, most wondrous and rare."

Here is the translation:

---

For the place where the two and five unite in essence is the very source from which the elixir is born. The great practitioner, recognizing this aperture of emptiness and nothingness as the site of intercourse, must be able to draw the primordial qi from the void, where its function in union is most profound! Thus, when Heaven and Earth unite, the myriad things are born; when the sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman unite, conception begins—all these are proofs of intercourse. This principle is perfectly clear, easily understood by all, yet no one understands it. The immortal masters, in their vast compassion, explain it to you: you need only meet at the place where the two eights converge, merging the two qi into one mass—then the great elixir may be born. Yet one fears that when dragon and tiger meet, they may exhale the qi of the two bowstrings, and the alchemist may fail to recognize it truly.

Another [Liu’s] saying: *"The golden essence blooms in splendor."*
[Li’s] saying: *"Recognize the golden essence."*

The rootless tree—its flowers are most fine,
Facing the scene, forget emotion, and play in the moonlight’s glow.
When the golden essence flourishes, its radiance dazzles the eye—
Do not mistake the melon in the garden.

The five metals and eight stones are all false,
The myriad herbs and thousand formulas are all amiss.
The golden toad, the jade crow—
Recognize them truly, and you are a master.

The *Wu Yuan* annotated edition reads *"when the moon opens month by month"* for *"facing the scene, forget emotion."*

[Liu’s commentary:] The primordial numinous treasure is firm and strong, centered and upright, pure and refined—its flowers are most fine. When they are at their finest, like the moon’s radiance unfolding, the golden essence flourishes, and one should contemplate it, lest it be missed before one’s eyes. *"Month by month it opens"* means it opens in due season, not out of season, following the moon’s fixed cycle, with movement and stillness in constant order, never deviating by the slightest.

The golden essence is the luminous essence of metal; in the moon, it is called moonlight; in man, it is called true essence. True essence is the essence of true numinosity, never dimmed, hence likened to moonlight and golden essence. The true numinosity of man is not easily known, but observing the moon’s truth reveals it; the true numinosity of man is not easily seen, but observing the moon’s radiance and the metal’s essence makes it visible. The essence and splendor of all things decay over time, yet the moon’s radiance opens month by month, and the golden essence never diminishes for ten thousand years. Just so is man’s true essence—though at times it may seem unrefined, this is due to the obscuring of postnatal yin qi, while its original substance has never perished.

When the golden essence flourishes, true essence flourishes; when true essence is at its peak, it illuminates the world, its qi filling the cosmos. White snow flies in the sky, yellow sprouts cover the earth, golden light dazzles the eye—left and right, everywhere are flowers. Yet this true essence has no form, no image, neither color nor emptiness. It cannot be sought with intention, nor guarded without intention; it can only be apprehended by spirit, not spoken by the mouth. Though it is bright and clear, manifest and complete, seen by all yet recognized by none, it is most difficult to recognize truly. The cultivator must delve deeply, investigating the subtlest principles with true knowledge and clear insight, before taking action—lest one mistake the false for the true, or seize upon what seems right but is not, and thus pluck the wrong melon in the garden.

Those blind practitioners of the world, who mistakenly believe the golden essence to be a tangible thing, may refine the five metals and eight stones or ingest the myriad herbs and thousand formulas—yet these are not of our kind. How could they form the elixir and extend life? Are they not greatly mistaken?

The toad is a creature of water, belonging to yin; yet when called *"golden,"* it is the yang within yin, the white within black—this is my true knowing. The crow is a creature that flies above, belonging to yang; yet when called *"jade,"* it is the yin within yang, the feminine within the masculine—this is my numinous knowing. Only true knowing and numinous knowing are of the same kind as myself, the treasures of my nature and life. Taking these two and uniting them to form the elixir, true yet utterly numinous, numinous yet utterly true—when true and numinous do not scatter, they merge with the heavenly principle, neither color nor emptiness, neither born nor destroyed. What is called moonlight is this; what is called golden essence is this. When the moon’s radiance opens and the golden essence flourishes, how could one not attain longevity?

Yet most people do not recognize what true knowing and numinous knowing truly are. If one recognizes them truly, one is a seasoned master of the Dao—none who do so fail to attain the Way. Alas! In the path of the golden elixir, a hair’s breadth of error leads one a thousand miles astray. How many truly recognize it?

**[Li’s Explanation]**
"Excellent" signifies beauty—the designation for the golden flower. Alchemists call true lead the "beautiful golden flower." As the *Cantong Qi* states: *"Lead’s body is black without, yet harbors a golden flower within."* From this black lead, one extracts white gold, pairs it with cinnabar mercury, and produces the primordial qi. This is precisely the beautiful golden flower. Returning it to oneself forms the returned elixir, yet the returned elixir must first refine the self. When self-refinement is pure, the returned elixir comes easily.

*"Facing scenes yet forgetting emotion"* describes the state after self-refinement is perfected: all beautiful sights stir no desire, and one’s sole focus is this single point of true qi. This true qi is called "moon radiance." Why is it also named "moon radiance"? Because the moon’s fullness reveals the timing of qi. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s glow—precisely when golden essence flourishes."* This aligns with the method of admiring moon radiance.

The moon waxes from the third day, which immortals compare to tender qi; by the fifteenth, it is full, which they liken to qi at its peak. When qi is full, golden essence thrives. Golden essence is the manifestation within moon radiance—same origin, different names. When it flourishes, yellow sprouts fill the crucible, and white snow suffuses the sky. The enlightened eye sees it blazing like a flower. The alchemist gathers it with the sword that reaches heaven, seizes the moment to stoke the fire, and refines it into the returned elixir. This flower alone is the true prize. Never discard the real flower to pluck false gourds from the garden, lest you lament your error.

Not only are gourds mistaken—even the five metals and eight minerals are false, not true; the myriad herbs and thousand formulas are all deviant, not correct. What seeks neither falsity nor deviation? Only this golden essence. Where does this golden essence arise? Observe the golden toad and jade crow—these are its birthplaces. The toad, a yin creature of water, is called "gold," for it is true yang within Kan; the crow, a yang creature of the sky, is called "jade," for it is true yin within Li. True yin and true yang interact, generating the qi of the two crescents, which in turn produces the true unity of qi. Moon radiance and golden essence are both this substance—only one must recognize it truly. If one does, one is a seasoned master, clear in fire timing and discerning of lead.

**[Liu’s Note]**
Gathering the medicinal ingredients.

**[Li’s Note]**
Plucking the yellow flower.

The Rootless Tree blooms with abundant flowers,
Scattered across the earth yet barred by the River of Love.
Hard to pluck, what can be done?
Step by step, tread into the Dragon-Tiger’s den.

Once the yellow flower is gathered and borne back to the cave,
One’s name is inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.
Laughing heartily, amidst the white clouds,
Prepare the celestial ladder to ascend the Great Luo.

**[Wu Yuan’s Note]**
Taking *ài* (love) as *ài* (obstacle) is mistaken.

**[Liu’s Note]**
Throughout the cosmos, the qi of the Dao fills all;
where the light of true spirit shines, there the flowers bloom—
so many, scattered across the earth.
Yet though flowers bloom everywhere, people fail to recognize them,
as if blocked by a river’s barrier.
Though one may wish to pluck them, it is most difficult,
and nothing can be done.
This difficulty arises because all in the world are bound by fame and profit,
entangled in love and affection,
abandoning the true to grasp the false,
taking suffering as joy.
Step by step, they walk into the perilous lair of Dragon and Tiger,
opposing the Way of life and destiny—
thus the flowers are hard to pluck.
But if one is a courageous man, resolute and decisive,
casting off worldly ties at once,
seeking a teacher’s oral instructions,
using the false to cultivate the true,
then among the myriad flowers, one may select and gather
the most central and upright yellow flower,
bear it back to the cave,
nurture it into the elixir,
prolonging life and enhancing vitality.
Thus one’s name is inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.
The yellow flower is the flower of central hue in the central earth of *wù-jǐ*,
pure and upright, brimming with vital force,
free of杂气.
When this vital force returns to the cave,
spring endures through all seasons,
as if dwelling in a nest of white clouds,
carefree and at ease—
another realm beyond the human world.
How could one not laugh heartily, knowing such joy?
At this stage, the Returned Elixir is attained.
Then, setting up the furnace anew and reestablishing the crucible,
one undertakes the work of ascent,
preparing the celestial ladder to become a Great Luo Heavenly Immortal.

**[Li’s Explanation]**
The innate substance of the primordial,
unaugmented by the worthy, undiminished by the foolish,
is possessed by all, born in each—
thus the flowers bloom in abundance.
Yet they are obstructed by the River of Love,
causing the original to be buried.
Though flowers bloom across the earth,
how can they be reached when the River of Love stands between?
The River of Love is the human heart of the posterior world of desire,
which obstructs the heart of the Dao of the prior heavens.
Once the Dao-heart is blocked,
plucking the immortal flower becomes difficult.
What, then, can be done?
The immortal master tells the seeker:
One must step by step seek, journey by journey inquire,
crossing one mountain after another, fording one river after another,
entering the Dragon-Tiger’s den—
only then may one glimpse the original.
This Dragon emerges from fire,
this Tiger arises from water and within it.
From the posterior heavens, they exhale the qi of the prior heavens.
The Dragon hides in yin, the Tiger in yang;
yin and yang unite, giving birth to Dragon and Tiger.
Dragon and Tiger unite, producing the golden flower.
This golden flower lies in the southwest, the *kūn* direction,
where earth is yellow—thus the flower is also yellow.
If one can gather this yellow flower and carry it back to the cave,
forming the golden elixir,
then one’s name is inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.
Laughing heartily—profound mastery attained.
Amidst the white clouds—deeply settled in tranquility.
Should one wish to advance further toward Heavenly Immortality,
one must again set up the furnace and crucible,
erect the celestial ladder—
only then can one become a Great Luo Heavenly Immortal.
Those who aspire to Heavenly Immortality
may thus prepare the celestial ladder.

**[Liu’s Note]**
Yang arises within yin.

**[Li’s Note]**
The medicine is produced within the crucible.

The Rootless Tree blooms with fragrant flowers,
In the lead crucible, warm and luminous, the treasure appears.
Upon the golden bridge, gazing toward the winding river,
Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen.

Swallowing the raven’s liver and hare’s marrow,
Exchanging all the dust-laden, old intestines.
In the realm of fame and profit, the land of love and affection,
Never again will one turn back, futilely toiling in vain.

**[Liu’s Annotation]**
The primordial true spirit gathers all virtues, unifying myriad perfections—its qi is most fragrant. At the moment of its purest fragrance, it is the time when the lead crucible glows warmly with treasure-light. The "lead crucible" is true knowing. Through this true knowing, one can cast off the old and embrace the new, cultivate immortality and attain truth—hence it is called the lead crucible. The "treasure" is the treasure of true spirit; without true knowing, true spirit does not manifest. For true knowing embodies the heart-mind of the Dao, and within the heart-mind of the Dao resides the primordial true unity of qi—this is called true spirit. The "warmth of the lead crucible" signifies the balance of firmness and softness, neither leaning nor bias, thus establishing the crucible. When the crucible is established, the heart-mind of the Dao emerges; as the heart-mind of the Dao emerges, the light of true spirit gradually arises—this is called the manifestation of treasure-light.

The "golden bridge" is metal; the "winding river" is water. Ascending the golden bridge to gaze upon the winding river reveals the image of metal within water. Metal within water is yang arising within yin—this is the sun seen within the moon, which is also the warm glow of the lead crucible manifesting treasure-light. When the light of the lead crucible appears, yin and yang unite in virtue, spirit and qi ride the moment in harmony. Thus, one enters the womb of creation, holding it fast without letting it depart—this is called "swallowing the raven’s liver and hare’s marrow." The raven’s liver is blue-green, the essence of the sun, symbolizing the numinous nature of numinous knowing; the hare’s marrow is white, the radiance of the moon, symbolizing the true emotion of true knowing. Swallowing the raven’s liver and hare’s marrow unites nature and emotion, so that emotion does not stray from nature, and nature does not stray from emotion—true to the point of numinosity, numinous to the point of truth. When nature and emotion become one, true spirit remains undimmed: round as a pearl, radiant as flame, bare and pure, unadorned and free. All postnatal accumulations are purged, the heart-mind of the Dao abides forever, the human heart is extinguished for good—thus the dust-laden, old intestines are wholly exchanged. With the intestines renewed, all things become empty; fame, profit, love, and affection—what is there to cling to?

**[Li’s Explication]**
The fragrance is neither perceptible nor foul—utterly pure and pristine, the fragrance of the primordial first appearing, unstained by the postnatal. The "lead crucible" is the external crucible. The method of refining lead requires establishing the external crucible in the southwest, called the "Land of Kun" or "Mother Kun." The mother’s body is inherently empty and must rely on the father’s solar essence to produce lead. The solar essence is dragon mercury—here, the "raven’s liver" below. The dragon is the eldest son, who takes the father’s place and enters the mother’s embrace, where qi and essence intermingle, and the crucible of primordial true lead is thus established. Ancestor Zhong said: *"The great yang moves into the bright moon"*—this is the method of establishing the crucible. The line below, *"Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen,"* refers to this moment of warmth. When the lead crucible glows warmly, the treasure-light appears. The "treasure-light" is the light of the treasure of life; when this light manifests, it is the primordial qi, its white image emerging from between the brows. Ancestor Lü said: *"The warm lead crucible, its light piercing the curtains,"* and also: *"Examine the space between the brows—there lies the sign."* This describes the same vision.

The "golden bridge" is the magpie bridge below, located on the path of the southwest, where the radiance of metal qi shines. The "winding river" is the qi encircling the magpie bridge, its light reflected in the southwest. Some past commentators, glossing Ancestor Lü’s line *"Upon the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams pure,"* mistakenly identified the winding river as the twelve curves of the small intestine, straying into demonic delusion. Others pointed to the space between mouth and nose—an even graver descent into delusion. Only Master Chen Niewan said: *"On the southwest path, the moon’s radiance shines bright; the great medicine returns, born from this place. I recall an ancient verse: ‘Above the winding river, the magpie bridge spans.’"* This truly captures the essence.

Why is this so? The southwest corresponds to *kun* (☷), and *kun* represents the abdomen. Where the precious radiance appears, the moon’s brilliance shines clearly; where the moon’s brilliance shines, the metal *qi* emerges in full. Thus, upon the golden bridge, one gazes upon the winding river, where the moon above the river shines directly upon the golden bridge.

The moon’s radiance gleams bright, and within yin, yang is born—hence the saying: *"Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen."* The sun is *taiyang*; the three-legged crow within it is the essence of the sun. To swallow the crow’s liver is to ingest the solar essence of the eastern direction; to consume the hare’s marrow is to partake of the lunar radiance of the western direction. When essence and radiance are combined, the great medicine is born; when sun and moon are both swallowed, the golden elixir takes form—thus the line: *"Swallow the crow’s liver and hare’s marrow, and all the dusty, old intestines are replaced."*

How then could love, fame, or profit disturb one’s pure heart? To turn back and dwell on such thoughts would be to waste the entire day in vain.

**Liu’s Verse:**
At the furnace, the work begins.

**Li’s Verse:**
The work of gentle nurturing.

The rootless tree blooms fresh and bright,
as talisman and fire refine mercury and lead.
At the furnace’s edge, the scene appears—
gathering all depends on the Dharma-boat.
A master’s hand grips the helm firm,
letting the vast waves churn beneath the sea.
Passing the three barriers, piercing the Mud Pill,
soon the nine apertures of the body are all opened.

**Liu’s Annotation:**
The treasure of true love, once all dust and grime are swept away, becomes utterly pure and pristine—how could its flower not bloom fresh? Yet its freshness depends entirely on the refining work of talisman and fire upon lead and mercury.

True numinosity is the essence of true knowing and numinous knowing; true knowing and numinous knowing are the functions of true numinosity. True numinosity divides into true knowing and numinous knowing, while true knowing and numinous knowing unite to form true numinosity. Refining the lead of true knowing and the mercury of numinous knowing is to refine true numinosity itself.

Refining means using true knowing to govern numinous knowing, and numinous knowing to align with true knowing. When true knowing and numinous knowing congeal, they restore the treasure of true numinosity—its flower’s freshness defies description. Yet while true numinosity is easily formed, the firing times are most difficult. As Master Ziyang said:
*"Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
without knowing the firing times, it is all in vain.
All depends on the power of cultivation—
a hair’s breadth off, and no elixir is made."*

The Dao of the golden elixir requires gathering the medicine at the proper time and refining it with the proper method. Without knowing the time or the method, even if the great medicine is within sight, it will not belong to you. Thus, when working at the furnace, within the indistinct there is form, and within the profound there is essence—a single spark of true numinosity’s light emerges from the formless, seeming to exist yet not, neither form nor emptiness. The scene appears before you: this is the moment when the great medicine arises.

At this time, even the Three Corpses, Six Thieves, Five Aggregates, and Seven Emotions—all manner of illusory scenes—may manifest. One must steady the Dharma-boat, grip the helm firm, forget all attachment to appearances, and let the waves churn beneath the sea without wavering. Through such effort, gradually gathering and refining, supporting yang and restraining yin, the longer one persists, the stronger the power. When the work is complete, essence naturally transforms into *qi*, *qi* into spirit, and spirit into emptiness. Passing these three barriers, the wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, the Dharma-body manifests, and the yin *qi* of the nine apertures throughout the body is all transmuted.

The three barriers are not the tailbone or spine of the artisan’s school, but the three stages of refining: refining essence into *qi* (the first barrier), refining *qi* into spirit (the middle barrier), and refining spirit into emptiness (the upper barrier). Passing these three, spirit merges with the Great Void, moving freely without obstruction—this is called "piercing the Mud Pill," for the Mud Pill Palace is where spirit is stored.

The nine apertures refer to the illusory body. After passing the three barriers and piercing the Mud Pill, the Dharma-body is accomplished, and the nine apertures and hundred channels of the illusory body, their yin *qi* transformed into yang *qi*, all shine with light. Even the million and four thousand hairs on the body become guardian spirits. Scholars must not let words obscure the meaning.

**Li’s Explanation:**
This chapter speaks of gentle nurturing. Wuyuan’s interpretation—that passing the three barriers, piercing the Mud Pill, and opening the nine apertures refers not to the tailbone or spine of the artisan’s school but to the three refinements, after which spirit merges with the Void and moves freely, illuminating the nine apertures of the illusory body—is valid. However, the preceding lines, if not understood in the context of gentle nurturing, would mix the stages of entering the chamber to return the elixir, gentle nurturing, and shedding the embryo into a single passage, which does not align with the immortal masters’ intent of providing step-by-step guidance. Here, we focus solely on gentle nurturing.

"Fresh" means radiant and bright—the deepening of the nurturing work, the image of daily renewal and monthly flourishing. "Talisman and fire" refer to the cyclical tasks of *zhun* and *meng*: at dawn, advancing the yang fire; at dusk, retreating the yin talisman.

The *zi* hour (11 p.m.–1 a.m.) is when yang is born, and advancing fire should begin at *zi*. By dawn, it is the *yin* hour (3–5 a.m.), yet fire is advanced at *yin* because yang’s fire is born in *yin*, and yang *qi* flourishes at this time. The *wu* hour (11 a.m.–1 p.m.) is when yin is born, and retreating the talisman should occur at *wu*. By dusk, it is the *xu* hour (7–9 p.m.), yet the talisman is retreated at *xu* because the fire’s storehouse resides in *xu*, and yin *qi* governs storage.

Retreating the talisman nourishes mercury; advancing the fire draws out lead. Lead governs mercury, and mercury embraces lead—lead diminishes day by day while mercury increases. Hence the line: *"Talisman and fire refine mercury and lead."*

"At the furnace" refers to the external furnace, not the furnace used when entering the chamber. When entering the chamber to refine lead, a crucible is necessary; for gentle nurturing, a furnace is used, but no crucible. Yet the furnace may be external or internal. As Master Ziyang said: *"Within, there is the natural true fire—
in the furnace, a blazing, enduring red."* This is the inner furnace.

Moreover, it states: *"For the external furnace, diligent effort in increasing and decreasing is essential—nothing surpasses the true seed."* This refers to the external furnace.

At the moment of tending the furnace, a wondrous scene appears before one. This is neither the manifestation of precious radiance nor the arising of illusory visions, but rather the civil fire of the inner furnace and the martial fire of the outer furnace. Through the interplay of civil and martial fires, one gradually gathers and refines, gradually refines and replenishes. During the period of gentle nurturing, the work must not be interrupted. It wholly depends on the master craftsman steering the Dharma-boat, undisturbed by wind and waves, lest they disrupt one’s primordial work. Only then can the Dharma-boat ferry abundantly, traversing ceaselessly—like Bodhidharma carrying gold across the sea, directly transcending to the other shore. Hence the lines: *"Gathering and refining rely entirely on steering the Dharma-boat; the master craftsman’s skillful hand firmly grasps the helm—heedless of the surging waves churning beneath the sea."* The latter three lines have already been clarified in Liu’s commentary, and thus will not be further explained here.

**Liu’s Words:** Recognize the true lead.
**Li’s Words:** The singular true lead.

The rootless tree’s blossoms bloom in full splendor—recognize the true lead as the primal ancestor.
Essence, *qi*, and spirit refine in one crucible; the woman transforms into a man, the old reverts to youth.
To capture the White Tiger in the West, first subdue the Green Dragon in the East.
Like attracts like—apply effort well: when the external medicine flows, the internal medicine flows as well.

In the *Wu Zhen Pian* annotated by *Wu Yuan*, *"splendor"* is written as *"lush,"* *"capture"* as *"lead,"* and *"West"* as *"garden"*—all without difference.

**Liu’s Commentary:** *"Lush"* denotes flourishing abundance. When the blossoms are at their peak, among them are both beauty and ugliness, partiality and uprightness intermingled. Only the true immortal blossom may be gathered and employed. What is this true immortal blossom? It is the true lead. The true lead is the true emotion of true knowing, the manifestation of true numinosity. As true knowing is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, outwardly black yet inwardly white, it is called true lead, also known as *gold in water*, *lead from the watery realm*, or *the flower of the moon*—its names are manifold, all symbolizing this single entity of true knowing. Only this true knowing contains the primordial true unity’s initial *qi*, the root of yin and yang, the source of the Five Phases, the seed of immortals and buddhas, the lineage of sages and worthies—it is the rightful primal ancestor for those who cultivate the Dao. Once this ancestor is recognized and brought home, revered and upheld without the slightest lapse, then essence, *qi*, and spirit naturally gather in one crucible, without need for force. For when the father returns, where can the child go? With the added work of talisman and fire refinement, even a woman may transform into a man, and the old may revert to youth. *"The woman transforms into a man"* does not mean a change in physical form, but rather that a woman, being purely yin, through cultivation and refinement, transmutes yin into yang, becoming like a man. *"The old reverts to youth"* does not mean a reversion in appearance, but rather that the old, whose *qi* is withered, through cultivation and refinement, returns to the root and reverts to the origin, becoming like a youth. However, the way for a woman to transform into a man or the old to revert to youth, though it begins with recognizing the true lead and true knowing, also requires first mastering the refinement of the self. If the refinement of the self is not thorough, true knowing will not come; even if it comes, it will not stay. Hence the line: *"To lead the White Tiger in the western garden, first subdue the Green Dragon in the east."* The White Tiger belongs to the west and metal, symbolizing true emotion; the Green Dragon belongs to the east and wood, symbolizing true nature. True emotion and true nature are originally of one family—why the need for leading and subduing? Because after their entanglement in the postnatal realm, the true becomes mixed with the false. True emotion turns into false emotion, kindness intermingled with harm—like a tiger leaving its den, rushing west to injure others, no longer belonging to oneself but instead residing in another’s home. Once true emotion becomes false, true nature is likewise obscured, transforming into false nature. With the false in control, the true retreats, and nature and emotion fall out of harmony—like the dragon in the east and the tiger in the west, never meeting. To restore the true, one must first eliminate the false; to lead emotion, one must first harmonize nature. The work of harmonizing nature is the work of refining the self. Refining the self means refining one’s temperament-nature. When the temperament-nature is transformed, true nature naturally manifests. With true nature manifest, it remains unshaken, and true emotion likewise emerges. With true emotion revealed, false emotion does not arise, allowing one to lead back the White Tiger to unite with the Green Dragon, where emotion and nature become mutually enamored. The White Tiger is the true lead, the primal ancestor—merely a different name for the same entity. Because true knowing is unyielding and strong, it is called the White Tiger; because true knowing is soft yet conceals strength, it is called true lead. *"Leading the White Tiger"* means obtaining the true lead. *"Leading"* does not imply force, but rather a leading without leading—when nature is settled, emotion naturally returns. This is simply the principle of like attracting like, the resonance of yin and yang within and without. Nature governs the interior and belongs to yin—it is the internal medicine; emotion governs the exterior and belongs to yang—it is the external medicine. Yin and yang are originally one *qi*, and nature and emotion are fundamentally of the same root. When the internal medicine flows, the external medicine cannot but flow as well. With internal and external communication, nature seeks emotion and emotion longs for nature. When nature and emotion harmonize, true numinosity congeals, and the Returned Elixir takes form. The Pure Yang Elder said: *"When nature abides, *qi* returns of itself; when *qi* returns, the Elixir naturally forms."* The Purple Yang Elder said: *"To refine the Nine Revolutions, first refine the self and hold the mind."* Both speak of the necessity of refining the self before the Returned Elixir. Alas! The true lead is easy to obtain, but refining the self is most difficult—the work of refining the self is truly great!

**Li’s Explanation:** *"Lush"* refers to the intensity of emotion. Lead is the true lead of the person. When true lead manifests, its emotion is at its peak. As long as one recognizes the true and obtains it, the Golden Elixir is immediately accomplished. For this true lead is the embodiment of the central yellow, the primal ancestor of the Great Elixir.

To obtain it and restrain mercury, the Three Families meet to form the Infant. Extending this further, thousands upon thousands, sons and grandsons, all trace their lineage from this true lead—hence it is called the Ancestor. Essence, *qi*, and spirit are refined in a single crucible; this is the state after lead returns and mercury is subdued, the Three Families having met.

Yet to create true lead, there first exists the wondrous method of the female transforming into the male, the old becoming the youth. Originally, the fire of the *Li* Palace is true essence; the water of the *Kan* Palace is true *qi*; between *Kan* and *Li*, there is the marvelous earth in use—true spirit, also called true intent. When *qi* and essence interact, with spirit presiding, then gold is born beneath the water, and mercury descends within the fire. Again, with spirit maintaining balance, regulating dominance and submission, through fierce refining and extreme tempering, the fire steams and the water boils, and the gold too ascends with the water—this is the power of essence, *qi*, and spirit refined in a single crucible. When it enters the *Li* Palace, the fire of *Li* is extinguished by the water of *Kan*, no longer flying nor fleeing. *Qi* is stabilized by spirit, essence is congealed by spirit, lead and mercury both die, merging into the fertile earth. The Three Families gather in the Central Palace, refining into a single Purple Gold Elixir—this is the marvel of essence, *qi*, and spirit refined in a single crucible.

Initially, the son of the Eastern House lodges in the West. The *Dui* of the West is precisely the Young Maiden, who acts in place of Mother *Kun*. Within the female crucible appears the *Zhen* male—this is the female transformed into the male. This male is called the Third Nine Young Lord, young in years, yet truly the Dao Father of Wood Duke, born by entering the womb of the child. Thus, Wood Duke is renamed the Young Master—this is the old transformed into the youth. This Young Master rides a white tiger, roaming the West with great ferocity. A Daoist once saw him and asked: *"You, the youth riding the tiger, were you transformed from Wood Duke?"* The Young Master, knowing the man’s heart held true awareness, dared not conceal the truth and answered: *"Yes."* The Daoist then turned and smiled, saying: *"The lead of the water region is but one taste. Master Cui’s words are true indeed."*

Now, to summon back the Young Master, one must first capture his white tiger, for the white tiger is the steed transformed from the Young Master’s primordial *qi*. If you wish to go to the West to capture his white tiger, you must first subdue the green dragon in the Eastern House. For the white tiger is the emotion of metal, and the green dragon is the nature of wood. When wood interacts with metal, fire arises within wood, and the fire in turn compels the metal to return. When metal merges with wood, water surges within metal, and the water in turn extinguishes the fire to stabilize it. These four, though distinct, are in truth the same; though of different kinds, they are in essence alike. Since they are of the same kind, it is fitting to employ my mysterious skill to bring them together. Thus, inner and outer unite, the outer returns and is subdued within, the external medicine connects with the internal medicine, and the internal medicine likewise connects with the external medicine. This passage speaks only of true lead, not of true mercury, for where there is lead, there is mercury—though mercury is unspoken, it is already within. Hence it is said: *"When the external medicine flows, the internal medicine flows."*

Lead, *qi*, male, youth, tiger—these are the external medicine. Essence, female, old, dragon—these are the internal medicine. As for spirit, it resides between the internal and external essence and *qi*.

**Liu’s Explanation:** Gathering the firing times.
**Li’s Explanation:** The six gates of firing times.

The Rootless Tree, its blossoms radiant,
Heaven responds with stars, earth with tides.
The Dragon-Slaying Sword, the Tiger-Binding Sash,
Revolving the Celestial Stem, wielding the Dipper’s handle.
Tempering a furnace of true sun and moon,
Sweeping away three thousand six hundred paths.
Ascending the clouds, roaming freely,
All sins, filth, and mundane dust vanish in a stroke.

**Liu’s Annotation:**
The true numen lies concealed within the postnatal, obscured by accumulated habits and guest *qi*. Its blossom is most difficult to unfurl. Should it chance to bloom, a single gleam of radiance pierces through the void—like a pearl, like dew—tender, delicate, and resplendent. Its appearance is most exquisite, as if half-opened, merging with the primordial *qi*. In heaven, it responds to the stars’ brilliance, yet not in full splendor; on earth, it responds to the tides’ swell, yet not in saturation. The stars’ brightness and the earth’s moisture are both signs of *yang qi* in its first stirrings.

When *yang qi* first stirs, it is the moment the true numen’s blossom is at its most tender. At this very peak of delicacy, it is easy for the conscious spirit to usurp its luminosity and spawn delusion, for nature to be disturbed and passions to shift. One must swiftly forge and temper with urgency, nip deviations in the bud, and uphold *yang* while suppressing *yin* to safeguard the treasure of life.

The Dragon-Slaying Sword serves to curb the *qi*-nature; the Tiger-Binding Sash serves to restrain wayward passions. When *qi*-nature does not flare, the true numen manifests; when wayward passions do not arise, true feeling is born. When true nature appears and true feeling arises, one revolves the Celestial Stem and wields the Dipper’s handle, turning killing into life and transforming punishment into virtue—thus may one temper a furnace of true sun and moon.

The sun is the image of *yang* containing *yin*, an analogy for the numinous awareness within true nature. This awareness is the feminine within the masculine, true *yin*. The moon is the image of *yin* containing *yang*, an analogy for the true knowing within true feeling. This knowing is the white within the black, true *yang*. Forging and tempering true *yin* and true *yang*—the two great medicines—into a single *qi*, they congeal into the elixir. Swallowed and ingested, it extends life and reverses destiny. This is the most sublime and wondrous Dao, not the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths that cling to emptiness or fixate on forms.

For when the Great Dao is accomplished, one ascends the clouds and roams freely, and all sins, filth, and mundane dust are swept away in a single stroke. Those three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, however, toil upon the stinking skin-bag, only inviting more sins, filth, and mundane dust—how could they ever dispel them?

**Li’s Exegesis:**
“Exquisite” describes its tender delicacy, the moment when the first *yang* germinates. Heaven corresponds to above, earth to below. When *yang* is born, a speck of starlight glimmers upon the brow—what the ancients called “heaven responding with stars”—and a vast tide of *qi* surges within the abdomen—what the ancients called “earth responding with tides.” Such are the portents of the medicine’s birth; they are no falsehood.

Master Wuyuan likened heaven’s stellar radiance and earth’s tidal moisture to the first stirrings of *yang qi*, neither vast nor saturated—another valid interpretation. Some also cite *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine*, where “heaven responding with stars” refers to the upper Magpie Bridge, and “earth responding with tides” to the lower Magpie Bridge, both holding profound principles.

Yet I have privately heard that “responding with stars” and “responding with tides” pertain to aligning with the moon and the hour—awakening to the moon through the stars, awakening to the hour through the tides. This is precisely the crucial firing time of the Great Return Elixir. I excerpt several lines from the *Can Tong Qi* as corroboration:

> *The metal reckoning is fifteen,*
> *The water number is the same.*
> *Before the furnace, fix the weights:*
> *Five parts water, with some to spare.*
> *These two are deemed authentic,*
> *The metal’s weight as in its prime.*
> *The third does not enter—*
> *Two parts fire accompany it.*

This is the true meaning of “responding with stars” and “responding with tides.” The metal must weigh fifteen taels, for metal corresponds to the moon’s number, signifying the metal essence’s vigor. Over five thousand forty-eight days, the celestial true *qi* is first complete. Fifteen taels of metal can generate fifteen parts of water—this is the first half of the month, the fifteen days. The water number matches the metal number, just as the tide number matches the star number.

If metal and water are insufficient, true water will not be born—this is what it means for heaven not to respond with stars or earth with tides. How then can one fix the weights? To align with stars and tides, take the first fifteen days of the month as the standard. From new moon to full, count one and a half days as one part. Two such periods—three days—usher in *geng*. Only then are there two parts of true water: heaven responds with stars, and earth with tides.

By the fifth day, it is three parts—three parts are not to be used. By the eighth day, it is five parts—five parts are even more excessive, neither responding with stars nor tides. Only two parts of water paired with two parts of fire constitute the true response to stars and tides. These two are the true signals of *kan* water. When metal first generates water, just at the two-part stage, the water source is utterly pure, possessing *qi* but no substance—this is the White Tiger’s first channel. As the tiger exhales *qi*, the dragon meets it with two parts of true fire, refining it into the elixir’s foundation.

As for the metal that generates two parts of water, it must wait until the fifteenth day, when the metal essence is at its peak and the water tide is born. This is the “second seven’s period,” when true lead first descends—this is responding with stars and tides.

One might ask: Why must the fire be two parts? The answer: In one hour’s work, divided into three *fu* and six *hou*, only one *fu* and two *hou* of fire are used. Thus, dragon and tiger are balanced, mutually consuming and merging. When the time arrives, one must wield the sword to subdue the dragon and grasp the sash to tame the tiger, revolving the Celestial Stem and wielding the Dipper’s handle to return to the Central Palace. When sun and moon conjoin their essences and are forged and tempered, the true Dao is attained.

My teacher from Wushan Mountain offered an even more precise and illuminating discourse, which I now elaborate in full:

*Qian* heaven is *yang*; the stars are heaven’s fire essence, *yin* within *yang*. *Kun* earth is *yin*; the tides are earth’s water *qi*, *yang* within *yin*. Essence is the father of fire; *qi* is the mother of water. When *qian* father and *kun* mother unite, *li* fire and *kan* water are born. Hence it is said: “Heaven responds with stars, earth with tides.” “Responding” denotes the mutual resonance between them.

The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Without the stars and moon, how could the square vessel yield water?"* From this we know that when celestial light illumines the earth, it responds with stars; when earth’s *qi* bears the heavens, it responds with tides. The immortals liken the stars of heaven to the fire within the human heart—fire being one’s nature, and nature belonging to the dragon. If not subdued, the stars scatter and fire disperses. Thus one must grasp the dragon-slaying sword to subdue it, the sword being great wisdom. They liken the tides of earth to the water within the human body—water being one’s emotions, and emotions being the tiger. If not tamed, the tides overflow and water flows unchecked. Thus one must hold the tiger-binding sash to tame it, the sash being great insight. Profound skill appears clumsy; great wisdom seems foolish. When insight and wisdom merge into darkness, the wondrous mind arises. To revolve the Celestial Stem and wield the Dipper’s handle requires the power of this wondrous mind. The Celestial Stem is the Northern Dipper, which governs life through its handle. Wherever the Dipper’s handle points, there life’s *qi* arises. When the wondrous mind within the human body moves the Dipper’s handle, it can transform death into life. As the Dipper’s handle revolves, the golden elixir enters within; when the golden elixir enters within, the wondrous mind returns to me. The wondrous mind is the true body of neither birth nor death, its virtue merging with heaven and earth, its radiance conjoining with sun and moon—it is the true sun and moon within the human body.

To seek the wondrous mind, one must return from the posterior heaven to the prior heaven. First, let the external sun and moon exchange their light externally, master the firing times, and know the cyclical signs; only then can it be attained. Upon returning, one must also let the internal sun and moon exchange their light internally, maintaining brightness day and night, harmonizing and nurturing—thus forging and tempering a furnace of true sun and moon. This is the wondrous essence of the golden elixir’s great Dao, the profound mystery of the seven returns and nine refinements. It sweeps away the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, allowing one to ascend the clouds and roam freely, erasing all karmic dust and worldly defilements with a single stroke. Without understanding this great Dao, there will never be a day of liberation; karmic dust and worldly defilements will only accumulate daily. How can one fail to awaken?

Moreover, **Liu’s Pointer** states: *"Invert the mechanism of qi."*
**Li’s Saying** states: *"Skillfully employ the thief’s mechanism."*

The rootless tree blooms high,
Ocean waves surge to the sky as the moon plays with the tides.
The Silver River’s path pierces the nine heavens,
The raft’s shadow spans the void, moored to the Dipper’s tip.
Touching the Weaving Maid’s shuttle stone,
Treading the Cowherd’s magpie bridge,
Entering the immortal court with bold courage,
Stealing the Queen Mother’s peach from Jasper Pool.

In the *Wu Zhen* annotated edition, *"moored"* is written as *"dry,"* and *"stealing"* as *"pilfering."*

**Liu’s Annotation:**
The prior-heaven great Dao encompasses heaven and earth, moves the sun and moon, and transcends the ten thousand existences. Its blossoms open exceedingly high—so high that the moon in the sky casts its light to the ocean’s depths. Though ocean waves surge to the heavens, water cannot drown the moon’s light; instead, the moon plays with the tides. This is like a person in the sea of suffering: circumstances cannot harm their true nature but instead refine it through those very circumstances. The Silver River’s path is distant, piercing straight through the nine heavens, yet difficult for mortals to cross. However, with a celestial raft spanning the void and revolving the Dipper’s tip, one can traverse it—as Zhang Qian once rode a celestial raft across the Silver River and witnessed the meeting of the Cowherd and Weaving Maid stars, a proven example. In principle, other rafts in the world can also cross the Silver River. What, then, is this celestial raft? It is the great Dao of the golden elixir. The great Dao of the golden elixir operates within the void, transforming the cosmos, reversing yin and yang, seizing creation, and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood—it is indeed a celestial raft. Yet the raft’s wonder lies in the operation of the Dipper’s tip. The Dipper’s tip is the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, *Yaoguang*, also called the Celestial Stem. Where it points is auspicious; where it rests is inauspicious, for life’s *qi* resides where it points. In an instant of turning the Dipper’s tip, yin and yang unite, and life’s sprouts emerge effortlessly. Thus it is said: *"Touching the Weaving Maid’s shuttle stone, treading the Cowherd’s magpie bridge."* The Weaving Maid belongs to yin; the Cowherd to yang. The magpie bridge is where they meet. Touching the shuttle stone and treading the magpie bridge, yin beckons yang, and yang comes to meet yin. When yin and yang unite, the golden elixir takes form. This principle is enacted within the waves, its workings performed in the void. Thus one can enter the immortal court with bold courage, pilfering the Queen Mother’s peach from Jasper Pool. Jasper Pool lies in the west; the Queen Mother is the old yin, the *Kun* mother. The peach is the elixir, the single yang of *Zhen*. The Queen Mother’s peach symbolizes *Kun* nurturing *Zhen* within. When the elixir in the west is stolen and returned to the east, it becomes one’s own, and the elixir is restored. Yet the wonder of this restored elixir lies in the union of yin and yang; the wonder of their union lies in reversing the *qi* mechanism amid the ocean’s waves, remaining unmoved and unshaken. To remain unmoved and unshaken amid the ocean’s waves is truly the courage of a great man. What heaven among the nine cannot be ascended? What Silver River cannot be crossed? What Queen Mother’s peach cannot be stolen? Those who cultivate stillness and forget form, acting only in quiescence, how could they know of this?

**Li’s Explanation:**
*"High"* refers to the void. *"Ocean waves surge to the heavens"* is what Master Ziyang called the time when *"the winds and waves are rough, giving birth to the mysterious pearl."* The winds rise and waves surge, their sound shaking the void—hence *"surge to the heavens."* Yet the mysterious pearl, like a full autumn moon, appears upon the sea—hence *"the moon plays with the tides."* Reversing the Silver River to pierce the nine heavens resembles Zhang Qian riding the raft, its shadow spanning the void, the *qi* mechanism reaching its zenith.

Yet before the river raft advances, there must first be a guide, lest the waters flow wantonly, straying from their course—this is why the tip of the Dipper serves as the mooring. The character *"moor"* here is most subtly chosen. For mortals, mooring a boat means resting for the night; but for the immortal voyager on the river raft, the Dipper’s tip is the only anchorage. To proceed straight and true, the momentum allows no mooring—yet to speak of mooring at the Dipper’s tip is precisely to moor where mooring is impossible, where mooring cannot be. Following the Dipper’s revolution, movement contains stillness, and within destruction, life arises. This is like the hero or bold knight who acts with unbridled resolve, riding the wind without mooring—such is the moment of grand culmination, of great flourishing. Not mooring surpasses mooring, and mooring is as good as not mooring. Such is the mooring at the Dipper’s tip.

The Weaving Maid and the Cowherd are the yin and yang stars of heaven, meeting once a year on the seventh night. The Weaving Maid belongs to yin, her loom’s shuttle likened to mercury; the Cowherd belongs to yang, and the Magpie Bridge is where the Cowherd and Maid reunite—this is the direction where metal and mercury converge. Above, the Dipper’s tip is mentioned; here, the Maid and Cowherd—thus the Dipper serves as their matchmaker. Without the Dipper, the Cowherd cannot meet the Weaving Maid; when the Dipper turns, the Cowherd crosses the river, and metal unites with mercury. As Patriarch Lü said: *"In the fire-advancing work, the Cowherd and Dipper are perilous."* Niwan remarked: *"The wonder lies in the Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Maid, and Cowherd."* Both express the same idea. Grasping the shuttle’s stone, mercury welcomes lead; treading the Magpie Bridge, lead and mercury become one. From this, heavenly fate is secured, ambition fulfilled, and one may encounter the immortal court with bold spirit. Why is this? Because they have stolen the Queen Mother of Jasper Pool’s peach.

Wu Yuan explained that Jasper Pool lies in the west, the Queen Mother is the Mother of Earth, and the peach symbolizes the yang embryo nurtured within earth—elixir is in the west, yet stolen and brought east to form the Returned Elixir. His annotation is clear, but *"steal"* does not match the immediacy of *"plunder."* Plundering the peach in the east is one; the hexagram *Kan* as plunder is two. Plundering the peach in the east is precisely going west to seize metal; *Kan* as plunder is precisely seeking lead from the water’s depths. How wondrous is the meaning of plunder!

**Liu’s Note:** Yin and yang strike and bind.
**Li’s Note:** Giving birth to the mysterious pearl.

The rootless tree, its blossoms in pairs,
Dragon and tiger mount the altar for battle.
Lead enters mercury, yin and yang conjoin,
Its form mirrors the priceless mysterious pearl.

This is the true seed of the homeland,
Returning the old to youth, life prolonged.
Ascend to heaven, to the realm of utmost bliss,
Spare yourself the wheel of rebirth and the sight of Yama.

**Liu’s Commentary:**
The Golden Elixir is formed when yin and yang forces clash and take shape—thus the blossoms must be paired to be of use. Yin and yang are one dragon and one tiger, one lead and one mercury. The dragon is true nature, mercury is numinous awareness, also the primordial spirit, both belonging to yin; the tiger is true emotion, lead is true knowing, also the primordial essence, both belonging to yang. The dragon and tiger in battle: nature and emotion held in tension. Lead entering mercury: spirit and essence congealing. When nature and emotion are bound, spirit and essence congeal, yin and yang unite, and the *qi* blends into one—true numinosity becomes perfectly luminous, the Dharma-body takes form, round and radiant, like a single mysterious pearl, a priceless treasure. This treasure is not an external thing but the true seed of our homeland, originally possessed but lost to the delusions of the postnatal world. Now, with yin and yang harmonized, what was lost is regained, what departed returns. Planted in the homeland, the root established, the Dao generates, generating without end—returning the old to youth, extending life without limit. Ascending to the heavenly realm of utmost bliss, one escapes the suffering of rebirth.

**Li’s Explanation:**
"In pairs" refers to the *qi* of the two crescents. When the *qi* of the two crescents unite, dragon and tiger mount the altar, devouring one another—battle means devouring. After a great battle, dragon and tiger are balanced. When the tiger battles the dragon, lead enters mercury; when the dragon battles the tiger, yin conjoins yang. When yang lead and yin mercury unite, the priceless treasure is born. As *Awakening to Reality* says: *"Tiger leaps, dragon soars, winds and waves surge—at the central true position, the mysterious pearl is born."* The mysterious pearl is the primordial unity of *qi*, the original source of immortals and buddhas, the true seed of our homeland, not an external thing. Veiled by the postnatal, it long ceased to manifest. Now, on the dragon-tiger altar, yin mercury and yang lead unite as true husband and wife, returning from within the postnatal Kan and Li to the primordial. Thus it is said: *"Its form mirrors the priceless mysterious pearl."* From this true seed of the homeland, those who obtain it return to youth, prolong life, ascend to heaven, reach utmost bliss, and escape the wheel of rebirth. This speaks of the method of dragon and tiger, yin and yang battling and uniting—one must seek the firing times in the commentary on *"When the blossoms are most fair."*

**Liu’s Note:** The Elixir returned in an instant.
**Li’s Note:** The Returned Elixir’s nurturing.

The Rootless Tree bears wondrous blossoms,
Cultivated in the moon for but a fleeting moment.
With hands that grasp the clouds, one ascends the cloud-ladder,
Plucking the first primordial branch.
Drinking wine and wearing flowers, the spirit soars,
Laughing at the immortal elders sunk in drunken stupor.
Entrusting to the knowing heart, guard it with care,
Lest the furnace’s firing times take flight.

**Liu’s Note:**
The primordial true spirit, though non-existent, can become existent; though deficient, can become whole—how wondrous the blossom! Yet what makes it wondrous is this: the primordial is veiled by the postnatal, utterly without trace. If one wishes to cultivate it, within a fleeting moment it can restore spring. The marvel of this restoration lies in plucking the first primordial branch’s blossom. This first branch is the ancestral qi of all life, the numinous root that gives birth to heaven, earth, and humankind. It does not fall into form, nor does it fall into emptiness; when contained, it is true emptiness, and when expressed, it is wondrous being. Utterly centered, utterly upright, utterly refined, utterly pure, it flickers in the indistinct and obscure like dewdrops, like lightning. It cannot be sought with intention, nor can it be preserved without intention. To seek it with intention is to cling to appearances; to preserve it without intention is to cling to emptiness. It lies in the stillness of nature and the forgetting of emotion, in turning the light inward and reflecting back, in utter emptiness and profound tranquility. Without plucking, it is plucked; without taking, it is taken. Naturally, the primordial true unity of qi arises from the formless, congealing into a pearl the size of a millet grain. Within and without, all is luminous—like wearing immortal blossoms, the spirit is refreshed, like drinking immortal wine. Wearing flowers and drinking wine, joy abides within, unknowing and unaware, following the decree of the Emperor. One enters the realm of intoxication. At this moment, the Returned Elixir has formed, and the original face is once more revealed. There is no need for external furnace adjustments; one must swiftly nurture it within the inner furnace, silently moving with numinous awareness, guarding it with vigilance. The mind must not scatter, ever wary of missteps in the firing times. The "knowing heart" is not an external knower but the heart that knows itself. The pacing of the firing times is known by the heart; if the heart knows without obscuring itself, the firing times will not err, and the Golden Elixir will ripen.

**Li’s Explanation:**
"Wondrous" means beyond human comprehension. Not only can humans not fathom it, but even yin and yang cannot. If it could be fathomed, yin and yang would not intermingle in the obscure and indistinct—how then could the primordial be cultivated?

Cultivating within the moon’s cycle begins when the third day yields the *geng* phase, where the medicinal material is fresh and tender. Within this *geng*-direction moon, the golden flower is cultivated by blending two parts fire with two parts water, stewing in primordial chaos for a moment—then the first primordial sprout emerges within the crucible. This is the work of a fleeting instant.

In that instant, when the first primordial sprout truly appears, the wondrous heart takes charge, immediately reversing the celestial course, soaring back to the Han River’s source. This is the hand that grasps the clouds, the ladder that ascends them—gathering the first primordial sprout.

To "drink wine" is to imbibe this first immortal elixir, where the primordial transforms into white nectar. To "wear flowers" is to don this first immortal blossom, where the primordial revives the spring of yang. Flower is wine, wine is flower; drinking and wearing them, wine becomes a loyal friend and flower a companion, filling one with harmonious spirit and qi, merging into a drunken haze. Thus it is said: *"Drinking wine and wearing flowers, the spirit soars—mocking the immortal elder, drunk as mud."*

The "knowing heart" is the shared heart, the selfsame wondrous heart. "Vigilant guarding" means observing the firing times with this wondrous heart. Yet guarding has many aspects, and the furnace’s fire has two extremes.

If the firing time is insufficient, one must adjust with *zhun* and *meng* to supplement and refine, requiring external furnace adjustments. If the firing time is complete, one guards it day and night with inner radiance, needing no external furnace adjustments. When the ten-month count is full and nine years have passed, the true person emerges from the crown of the head.

Otherwise, if the external furnace is removed prematurely when it should remain, the firing time will be incomplete and the elixir will not mature. If the external furnace lingers when it should be removed, the firing time will be excessive and the elixir will be harmed. If the inner furnace is abandoned too soon when it should persist, the firing time will lack purity and the elixir will not be efficacious. If the inner furnace remains when it should be released, the firing time will stagnate like ignorance and the elixir will not manifest. All these are errors in the furnace’s firing times.

This is why the knowing heart must guard with precision and care to avoid such missteps. "Flying" here signifies deviation—compare it with the earlier chapter *"When the Flower Takes Flight."* Further:

**Liu’s Explanation:**
Harmonizing yin and yang.

**Li’s Explanation:**
Obtaining the medicine and returning the elixir.

The Rootless Tree’s blossoms turn golden true,
Born in the central land of Wu and Ji’s hue.
The eastern maiden, the western man,
As husband and wife, they enter the nuptial chamber’s span.
The Yellow Matron urges them to drink the ghee’s wine,
Each day they grow drunk in warmth divine.
This immortal recipe, this soul-returning brew,
Revives the dead and restores life anew—such is the Medicine King’s due.

**Wu Yuan’s Annotated Edition:** *"Born in"* is rendered as *"color true."*

**Liu’s Annotation:**
Yellow is the true color of the central Wu and Ji. Wu, as yang earth, governs movement; Ji, as yin earth, governs stillness. Wu and Ji, dwelling at the center, unite to form true sincerity—also called true intent. When the blossom’s color is truly golden, the true spirit enters the central, upright position. Yet for the true spirit to be centered and upright, nature and emotion must be as one. The eastern maiden is the nature of Wood; the western man is the emotion of Metal. One nature, one emotion—paired as husband and wife, they enter the secluded chamber. With the Yellow Matron urging them to drink the ghee, harmonizing the firing times, what was disharmonious must harmonize, and harmony endures. The ghee wine is not the dregs of the mortal world, nor is it the tangible essence, fluids, or blood within the body. It is the qi of harmonious intermingling between yin and yang, coalescing into the true unity of essence, flowing as the true unity of water. Its flavor is sweet, its fragrance rich—ancients called it jade liquid, nectar, dew, or ghee, all metaphors for this single point of harmonious qi. To "urge drinking" is to refine what is not harmonious until it attains perfect balance. In the practice of the Dao, when yin and yang achieve harmonious union, one remains responsive yet serene. Gazing afar, phenomena dissolve into non-phenomena; observing closely, the body dissolves into non-body; turning inward, the heart dissolves into non-heart. Unknowing and unperceiving, one follows the Emperor’s decree, drinking the ghee daily and entering the realm of intoxication. This intoxicated delight is the immortal’s recipe, the soul-returning brew—able to revive the dead, restore life, the great Medicine King.

The Center, Wu-Ji, the Yellow Matron—all are alternate names for true sincerity. In terms of yin-yang harmony, it is called the Center; in terms of yin-yang movement, Wu-Ji; in terms of yin-yang harmonization, the Yellow Matron; in terms of action, true sincerity; in terms of stillness, true intent. Thus, one thing bears many names, but in essence, it is simply true sincerity. Recognize this sincerity, and upon it, apply steadfast effort. First, seek emotion through nature; then, return emotion to nature; next, harmonize nature and emotion; finally, merge them into oneness, forming the true spirit’s supreme treasure. From beginning to end, all success hinges on this single sincerity—how vast is sincerity’s power! Returning to the practical, when the true spirit is centered and upright, it is nature and emotion in harmony. When nature and emotion harmonize, true sincerity resides within. When true sincerity manifests, nature and emotion naturally remain inseparable, and the true spirit is inherently centered and upright. These three interdepend yet remain mutually reinforcing.

**Li’s Explanation:**
Yellow is the true color, the right awakening of Buddhism, the right qi of Confucianism and Daoism. In Buddhist scriptures, it is called the yellow flower; in immortal classics, the yellow sprout. Yet the yellow sprout has two kinds: one is the new medicine of the third day, the other the great medicine of the fifteenth. As *Awakening to Reality* states: *"Where the yellow sprout grows, Kan and Li intertwine"*—this is the new medicine of the third day. Where the yellow sprout grows is where Kan and Li should unite to cultivate the second yellow sprout. *Awakening to Reality* says: *"Plant the yellow sprout, and it gradually matures"*—this is the second yellow sprout, the great medicine of the fifteenth day. The yellow sprout’s maturation arises from Kan and Li’s union. Their union occurs in the central land of Wu and Ji. The Center is where essence and qi coalesce; the land of Wu-Ji is where movement and stillness harmonize. Once harmonized and coalesced, in an instant, the yellow sprout emerges from within—hence *"born in the central land of Wu and Ji."* This yellow sprout has many names; in this chapter, it is the western man. The western man is the qi of Metal; the eastern maiden is the essence of Mercury. Gathering the Metal qi to subdue the Mercury essence—this is the path of returning Metal and Mercury, the union of husband and wife entering the nuptial chamber. Once in the chamber, the Yellow Matron must guard them. The Yellow Matron is the "knowing heart" mentioned in the previous chapter. If the couple fears discord, their spirit, intent, and qi will struggle to reach the state of harmony, and the elixir will not form. Thus, the Yellow Matron attends them, urging them to drink the ghee. The ghee is the essence nurtured externally, the harmonious qi ingested internally. The Yellow Matron is the intimate confidante—naturally, the furnace’s firing times will not err. Between dawn and dusk, she urges them to drink frequently, each day growing drunk in warmth—a true delight. This wine is not of the mortal world but an immortal’s recipe, called the soul-returning brew. It can revive the dead, restore life—no minor or external medicine compares; it is the Medicine King. This chapter describes the work after the second firing’s quest for Lead and the fourth firing’s return of the elixir. Seeking Lead is an external affair: on the third day, when the moon emerges in Geng, one applies effort—called pairing water with fire, the Dragon approaching the Tiger, yin meeting yang, Li uniting with Kan, nature merging with emotion, Mercury investing Lead, the maiden marrying the man. All these describe the generation of the precelestial from the postcelestial, the union of essence and qi—an external medicine. Its work lies without, requiring but one talisman and two firings to establish the elixir’s foundation.

Returning the elixir is an internal affair: on the fifteenth day, when the moon is full, one applies effort—called extinguishing fire with water, where water is the celestial water of Tian Gui; the Tiger marrying the Dragon, where the Tiger is the Tiger of the Western Direction; yang subduing yin, where yang is the yang containing the true; Kan filling Li, where Kan is the precelestial Kan; emotion returning to nature, where emotion is the emotion of metal; Lead restraining Mercury, where Lead is the Lead of True Unity; the man pairing with the maiden, where the man is the man of pure yang. All these describe the precelestial governing the postcelestial. In sum, it is the union of true qi with true essence—an internal medicine. Its work lies within, requiring two talismans and four firings to congeal the golden elixir.

All this the ancients left undifferentiated; here I set it forth in detail, that when reading the elixir classics, one may clearly distinguish the two medicines.

**Liu’s Saying:** Congealing the sacred embryo.
**Li’s Saying:** Capturing and subduing the fire-medicine.

The rootless tree, its blossoms radiant bright,
The moon’s yin soul presses close the sun’s yang spirit.
Golden Crow’s marrow, Jade Rabbit’s essence—
These two seized and simmered in one vessel.
Yang fire and yin talisman divide at midnight and noon,
Bathing added at dawn and dusk’s gates.
Guard the Yellow Court, nurture the Valley Spirit—
A man with child! How the world laughs!

**Liu’s Annotation:**
The precelestial true spirit, its original luminosity,
Pierces heaven and earth, illuminating all—this is the blossom’s radiance.
What makes it radiant? The harmony of yin and yang qi.
Man’s singular self is pure yin, like the moon’s darkness without light,
Yet must borrow another’s deathless method to generate yang,
As the moon borrows the sun’s light to shine.
The moon’s yin soul pressing the sun’s yang spirit—
Yin and yang unite, their brilliance at heaven’s heart,
This is true knowing and numinous knowing conjoined,
The image of true spirit undimmed.
The Golden Crow’s marrow is the sun’s spirit,
In man, the feminine within the masculine—
The true yin of numinous knowing.
The Jade Rabbit’s essence is the moon’s soul,
In man, the white within the black—
The true yang of true knowing.
Earlier I spoke of Crow’s liver and Rabbit’s marrow;
Here, Crow’s marrow and Rabbit’s essence—
A great distinction, not to be conflated.
For Crow’s liver and Rabbit’s marrow are the medicine of the returning elixir,
True knowing and numinous knowing,
Yin and yang not yet united but on the verge of union—
Thus, the liver of the Crow, the marrow of the Rabbit.
Crow’s marrow and Rabbit’s essence are the medicine of the great elixir,
True knowing made numinous, numinous knowing made true,
Yin and yang already united and harmonized—
Thus, the marrow of the Crow, the essence of the Rabbit.
Not yet united but on the verge of union: forced effort,
The false restored to the true.
Already united and harmonized: natural function,
The true made truer still.
Take these two true medicines,
Knead them into one, refine the yang within yang,
Then apply the fire-times of midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk,
To complete the great elixir of golden liquid.
Yet this midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk—
Not the midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk of the horizon,
But the midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk within the body.
When true knowing appears, it is midnight—
One must use firm advancing fire to stir true knowing from the mysterious.
When numinous knowing arrives, it is noon—
One must use gentle retreating talisman to draw numinous knowing into the feminine.
When true knowing advances to the central balance, it is dawn—
One must ice-bathe this central balance to prevent over-advance.
When numinous knowing retreats to the central balance, it is dusk—
One must ice-bathe this central balance to prevent over-retreat.
This is the way of talisman, fire, and ice-bathing—
An unchanging method through the ages.
To apply effort by the horizon’s midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk is utterly mistaken.
When talisman and fire are unerring, bathing timely,
Yin and yang respond without bias,
The Mysterious Female is established, and the Valley Spirit arises within it.
The Yellow Court is the central rightful position,
The single aperture at the center of yin-yang union,
Also called the gate of the Mysterious Female.
When the Mysterious Female is yang and the Mysterious Male yin,
Yin and yang unite, and this aperture exists;
When yin and yang are biased, this aperture vanishes.
With this aperture, there is a valley; with a valley, there is spirit.
Without this aperture, no valley; without a valley, no spirit.
The valley is the Yellow Court.
Yellow is the color of the center;
Court means emptiness.
Because it is empty at the center, it is named the Yellow Court.
Empty, it is numinous; numinous, it is spirit—
This is the Valley Spirit.
Observe the mountains: two cliffs stand facing,
Between them a valley—
Call out, and the valley echoes—
This echo is the Valley Spirit, commonly called the cliff baby.
When man’s yin and yang unite,
Within them is spirit—
Just so.
Yet without reaching the state of yin-yang union,
There is no center, no valley—
How could spirit dwell there?
Only when yin and yang truly unite
Is there a center, a valley,
And spirit naturally arises—
This is what is meant by “the precelestial qi comes from the midst of emptiness,”
By “true emptiness containing wondrous being,”
By “to keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.”
When yin and yang unite as one qi,
The Valley Spirit abides in the Yellow Court—
This is called a man with child.
“Guard the Yellow Court” means guarding the center.
“Nurture the Valley Spirit” means embracing the One.
Guard the center, embrace the One—
Ten months’ work complete,
A body beyond the body,
One who endures as long as heaven and earth.
Such true and real dharmas are the work of emptiness,
Not wrought from form.
Those who fiddle with circulating work on the stinking skin-bag,
Falsely hoping to congeal the sacred embryo—
How could they know what makes the Valley Spirit the Valley Spirit?

**Li’s Explanation:**
Brightness is the arising of the great medicine,
The empty chamber generating whiteness,
Radiating great light,
The time of great awakening, great enlightenment.

The great medicine is the yang within lead, the gold within cinnabar—prior to the prior Heaven. Like the lunar essence dwelling in the heart of heaven, pressed close to the solar spirit, it forms a radiant orb of light, unlike the slender crescent of the third day, distant as the horizon, near as the moth-browed moon.

The word *pressed* is crucial—it means intimate closeness, the two refining each other in one place. When sun and moon conjoin as one, the solar spirit pours entirely into the lunar essence, illuminating ten thousand miles, the heart of heaven gleaming bright as snow. The two are captured and refined together—not seizing the golden crow first, then the jade hare, but seizing the golden crow to grasp the jade hare. Capturing one is capturing both.

At the moment of capture, there are the four fire phases of zi, wu, mao, and you, entering the gates. Thus the golden crow flies into the Palace of Broad Cold, and with the marrow of the golden crow, the essence of the jade hare is harmonized. Then the essence of the jade hare is entirely transformed into the marrow of the golden crow—this is the lunar essence pressing the solar spirit, skillfully refining them in one place.

At this time, the yang spirit is complete, the yin essence formless. The two become one, and within the one, the two remain. Yin is exhausted, yang is whole, and great light radiates forth. Thus it is called the yang within lead, the gold within cinnabar—prior to the prior Heaven. At this stage, it becomes the great medicine of golden liquid. Following the four fire phases of zi, wu, mao, and you in ingestion, this is the nine-times-cycled great returning elixir.

What is *zi*? The arising of yang is *zi*, so advance the yang fire.
What is *wu*? The descent of yin is *wu*, so withdraw the yin tally.
*Bathing* means natural regulation, neither hasty nor slow. This work should be applied when the yang fire arrives at mao and the yin tally arrives at you, so that yang is not too rigid, yin not too yielding—rigidity and softness balanced, ingress and egress harmonized.

Formerly, Master Tao Cuncun elucidated the secret of firing in the *Cantong Qi*, including his teacher’s *Song of Fire Phases* in his commentary. I deeply admire it and append it here for verification:

*I recall my immortal master’s Daoist method,*
*All belongs to our own that-move.*
*Originally no zi or wu to withdraw or add,*
*How could there be hare or fowl, punishment or virtue?*
*Ask when is my zi?*
*I say: at the time the medicine arises.*
*Ask when is my wu?*
*Nothing more than the medicine facing the golden gate.*
*Ask when is mao?*
*The red child arrayed in Fire Cloud Cave.*
*Without Guanyin the Savior,*
*The great medicine would surely burst.*
*This is the hour of bathing,*
*Beyond this, the boat crosses the Yellow River.*
*Again ask what is the you gate?*
*It is when the Conception and Governor merge.*
*Without the Yellow Skirt at this time,*
*How could the medicine be perfectly auspicious?*
*Beyond this is the xu treasury—*
*Seek the message within the treasury.*
*This is the mind-to-mind transmission,*
*The supreme Dao needs no other search.*

When the medicine arrives at the mao gate, one must employ the stillness of Guanyin. Guanyin’s stillness governs with strict control, preventing the red child from acting recklessly, so that sweet dew arises. At the you gate, one wraps it in the Yellow Skirt, preventing the primordial pearl from spilling, so that the white liquid congeals—this is the wondrous use of bathing.

The Yellow Court is the center. The Valley Spirit is the empty numen. Guarding the center and nurturing the empty numen, the Dharma-body manifests its image—a man resembling a woman with child, both amusing and endearing.

**Liu’s Explanation:**
The true emptiness Dharma-realm.

**Li’s Explanation:**
Perfect penetration, self-so ease.

The rootless tree, its flowers crimson red—
Pluck all the red flowers, and the whole tree is empty.
Emptiness is form, form is emptiness—
Discern true emptiness within form.
When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes,
Yet the Dharma-realm endures, never falling into emptiness.
Called perfect penetration, named great hero,
Nine generations ascend to the ninefold heavens.

Wu Yuhuan’s annotated edition writes *golden flowers* as *red flowers*, which is better, so I follow it. The character *vanishes* was mistakenly written as *Dharma*.

**Liu’s Commentary:**
The great Way of the golden elixir takes transcending all phenomena—soundless and scentless—as its ultimate goal. How could flowers have a red color? If there is even a trace of color, the post-Heaven qi and temperament are not yet fully transformed, and the great Way is not achieved. The ancient immortals said: *"Not an iota of yin qi unexhausted, not an immortal."* For if even an iota of yin qi remains, there is an iota of yang qi incomplete. The true spirit still has moments of damage—this cannot be called the Way of the nine-return, seven-reversion golden liquid great elixir.

Cultivators must pluck all the red flowers, eliminating the adventitious dust-roots accumulated since the beginningless kalpas, returning to the state where all things are empty, reverting to the soundless, scentless visage before parents were born. Yet this *emptiness* is not the same as the insensate extinction of wood or earth. There is a Way of borrowing the false to complete the true, of using the true to transform the false. Thus it is said: *"Emptiness is form, form is emptiness—discern true emptiness within form."*

If one is single-mindedly without thought, one clings to emptiness; if there is even a hint of thought, one clings to form. To say *"emptiness is form"* is not emptiness; to say *"form is emptiness"* is not form. Neither emptiness nor form, yet both emptiness and form—this is true emptiness abiding within form.

To say *"when true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes, yet the Dharma-realm endures, never falling into emptiness"* means that true emptiness, once fully realized, is originally without form. Without form, there is the Dharma-realm; with the Dharma-realm, it does not fall into emptiness. Because it is true emptiness, there is the Dharma-realm; because there is the Dharma-realm, there is no form. Without form, with the Dharma-realm—thus emptiness is true, and truer than emptiness.

Cultivating the Dao to the point of true emptiness yet possessing Dharma-aspects—Dharma-aspects yet abiding in true emptiness—this singular, wondrous existence pervades the Dharma-realm with perfect interpenetration, forming an indestructible vajra-body. Neither water nor fire can assail it, blades nor weapons can strike it, tigers nor rhinoceroses can harm it; this is called the Great Hero. Not only does one’s own body ascend to the ranks of immortals, but even nine generations of ancestors are liberated together, rising to heaven and becoming divine.

Formerly, when Śākyamuni Buddha cultivated the sixteen-foot golden body, his Dharma-aspect resided in the Mahāvīra Hall—this is precisely that Dao.

**[Li’s Explanation]**
The red is the great elixir’s symbolic form. The *Daoist Sentiments Song* and *The Rootless Tree* by the Immortal Master are both essential works; through them, one may perceive this truth. The *Daoist Sentiments Song* says:
*"Of ten thousand images, none are of the same kind;
A single crimson radiance is the utmost reality."*
When the red radiance manifests, the flower is truly red. Once the red flower is obtained, the true elixir is secured—apart from this red flower, there is no medicine to be gathered. When the nurturing process is complete and the furnace and cauldron are set aside, all those flowering trees are no longer discussed. Thus it is said: *"Plucking all the red flowers leaves the tree empty."* Once the flowers are empty, my Dao is attained; once my Dao is attained, emptiness is no longer empty. Since emptiness is no longer empty, emptiness is form; yet this form is not the form of form-aspects—it is the form of Dharma-aspects. Penetrating true emptiness as non-empty, true emptiness resides within form. When true emptiness is fully realized, form-aspects vanish entirely; when form-aspects vanish entirely, Dharma-aspects endure forever. The enduring of Dharma-aspects is true emptiness as non-empty.

Perfect interpenetration means that merit and practice are complete, all dharmas are mastered, and the substance and function of true emptiness are fully possessed. Once called "perfect interpenetration," one must be called "Great Hero"; once called "Great Hero," one must become a patriarch of immortals. How could the nine generations of ancestors not ascend together, rising to the ninefold heavens?

**[Liu’s Words]**
Return to utter vacuity.

**[Li’s Words]**
Attain the rank of the Three Purities.

*The Rootless Tree*:
*"The flower is truly without root,
Formless and shapeless, hard to depict.
Nameless, yet heeding the call,
Seized and placed within the alchemical furnace.
Circulating the samādhi fire of the microcosmic orbit,
Tempering true emptiness to return to the Great Vacuity.
Visiting the immortal capital, receiving the celestial talisman—
Only then is one a true man, a great hero."*

Wu Yuanben interprets the word *"middle"* as *"three fields,"* yet still understands it as the wondrous aperture of the middle.

**[Liu’s Commentary]**
The treasure of the primordial true spirit is fundamentally empty in substance, coalescing as a single qi—how could there be a flower? Since there is no flower, no form or image, it is difficult to depict or illustrate. If it cannot be depicted or illustrated, how could it have a name or surname? Yet though nameless and surnameless, it is utterly empty and utterly numinous—silent and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated, like an echo answering a call in a valley: within true emptiness lies wondrous existence. With this marvel of responsiveness, one seizes the opportunity at the point of resonance, capturing it and placing it within the alchemical furnace of the three fields, using the true fire of samādhi to temper and refine it into reality. From true emptiness, one may return to the Great Vacuity. When the Dao returns to the Great Vacuity, emptiness is no longer empty—only the One Real remains, with nothing else. The three fields are not the common Daoist terms for the *qihai*, *jiangong*, and *niwan*; rather, they are the cinnabar field where the three treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—converge. This is called the Gate of the Mysterious Female, also known as the Mysterious Pass, the Central Yellow Court, the Alchemical Furnace, the Altar of Taiyi, the Gate of Wuji, or, in sum, the Aperture of Vacuity. The treasure of the primordial true spirit governs the three substances—essence, qi, and spirit. Once the true spirit is restored, the three substances are all restored, self-generating and self-transforming, harmoniously blending in primordial unity. First, from non-being it creates being; then, from being it transforms into non-being. Tempering true emptiness is the marvel of transforming from being into non-being. Once being is transformed into non-being, both form and spirit attain perfection, becoming one with the Great Vacuity. With merit and practice complete, one visits the immortal capital and receives the celestial talisman, becoming a Perfected One of the Ten Poles and Great Loftiness—the great man’s work is accomplished.

**Eulogy:**
Revealing the secrets of Laozi and Zhuangzi,
Continuing the heart-transmission of Zhong and Lü.
Unveiling the wondrous principle of the primordial,
Cleaving open the tangled paths of the void.
Distinguishing true and false in the crucible,
Clarifying genuine and spurious in the medicine.
Emptiness and form blend into a single qi,
Hard and soft pair like two strings.
Hark!
The entire process of the elixir method is fully disclosed,
The fire phases of advance and retreat are wholly inscribed.
The *Twenty-Four Songs of Longevity*—
Whoever understands them becomes an immortal, never to die.

**[Li’s Explanation]**
The word *"non-being"* carries forward the meaning of *"emptiness"* from the previous chapter, advancing the idea to conclude the twenty-four songs. Refining the elixir to the point of emptiness is already perfect, yet if there remains a thought of true emptiness, then there arises a thought of Dharma-aspects—emptiness still falls short of non-being. Laozi said: *"Observe emptiness as empty; emptiness is no longer empty. What is emptied is already non-existent; even non-existence is non-existent—profoundly still and eternally quiescent."* This alone is great transcendence, great awakening, great purity, and great perfect enlightenment. Why? The wondrous existence of profound stillness appears as emptiness, yet is emptiness and non-being—it cannot be sought through form or image, nor depicted through illustration. Because it is formless and imageless, it is difficult to depict or illustrate; one can only abide in its profound stillness. Previously, when gathering the primordial, there were names like *"gold"* for essence, *"yellow"* for the sprout, and *"white"* for the primordial. But this profound stillness of the true has no name or surname. Though nameless and surnameless, it heeds the call—an echo in an empty valley, each sound answering the last. Questioned, it responds as if commanded; it is the utmost subtlety of heaven and earth.

Silent and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating—this is the utmost spirit of heaven and earth. Why is this so? Because the profound stillness of the true is concealed within nothingness. The principles of sages, immortals, and buddhas deeply penetrate creation, hiding existence within non-existence. At this level, the uncanny and wondrous manifest, as seen in figures like Leng Qijing, Zhang Jinghua, and Zhou the Mad Immortal.

Our Master Sanfeng, embodying the Dao as his essence, must grasp nothingness with nothingness to enter the intermediary realm of emptiness and non-being. There, great creation and transformation unfold: within the crucible, the true fire of the Zhou Tian Samadhi is stirred, refining and forging until the Dharmakaya of emptiness returns to the Great Non-Being. The Great Non-Being is the realm of the sagely and true—it is the Jade Purity’s Chaos of Great Non-Being and the High Purity’s Crimson Chaos of Great Non-Being.

Those who refine themselves into immortality receive only the ranks of the Grand Purity. Yet if one can return to the Great Non-Being, they first pay homage to the Dao and its virtue, then to the Jade Emperor, and finally to the Primordial Beginning, attaining the fruition of the Three Purities. This "return" signifies that all foolish men and women are originally beings of the Three Purities. However, due to errors in past thoughts, they descend through kalpas, remaining as foolish men and women, unable to regain the realm of the sagely and true. If they turn their hearts toward goodness, seek the Dao, and find a teacher, progressing from foundational cultivation to self-refinement, undergoing the seven returns and nine restorations, refining until emptiness and returning to non-being—from non-being, they return to the Great Non-Being—then they are once more guests of the Three Purities.

Yet to forge the true emptiness, the fire of the Zhou Tian Samadhi must be employed. The Zhou Tian is not the "River Chariot" but rather the movement within heaven, its coils unfolding across the void, deeply penetrating the subtle transformations of the Dao’s natural law. Samadhi is not the "yang fire" but rather the union of heaven’s one and earth’s two into three. Within the midst of heaven and earth, I establish the tripod and arrange the furnace, where spirit and qi merge in obscurity—this is the immortal’s fire for refining immortals, the celestial elixir of primordial spirit.

When merit is complete and conduct perfected, one ascends to pay homage to the Three Heavens, visits the immortal capitals, receives celestial decrees, and may be enfeoffed as a True Lord, an Imperial Lord, a Heavenly Venerable, or appointed to offices such as the Five Peaks, renowned mountains, grotto-heavens, or blessed lands as a master of immortal selection. Only then is one a true man, the greatest of great men—divine to the utmost degree!

In praise:
Scattering the flower-rain that fills the sky,
Spreading golden earth across the land.

With hands striking the fish-drum and clapper,
With mouth singing the immortal melodies of the Upper Grotto.
The Four Continents all receive the teaching,
The Dao’s sentiment spans ten thousand ages.

Ah!
Wherever the Primal Awakening speaks, true numina abide—
First hold fast to the intent of our school.
This mountain dweller proclaims the true instructions by the book,
Broadly opening the Non-Dual Gate to deliver the world.
