*Masters Section, Volume 14: Alternative Transmissions Beyond the Yijing*
*Daoist Category · Abstract*

We, your ministers, respectfully note:

*The Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, in one *juan*, was written by Yu Yan of the Yuan dynasty. This work employs Shao Yong’s *Xiantian Tu* (Chart of the Primordial Heaven) to elucidate the safeguards of the alchemical tradition. The *Xiantian Tu* has been transmitted since Chen Tuan, and since the Song dynasty, none have not revered it as the esoteric script of Fuxi, the foundational meaning of the hexagrams and lines. Though Lin Lixu of the Shu school attacked it on rational grounds, he could not expose the root of its borrowings. Outnumbered, he could not prevail.

By the Yuan dynasty’s *Yanyou* era, Chen Yingrun of Tiantai first identified it as the *Cantong Qi*’s furnace-and-fire theory. His argument was well-founded, yet those who venerated the *He* and *Luo* traditions deeply concealed its origins, resorting to endless sophistry. Only Yan’s work, *The Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, is entirely free of rhetorical embellishment. In its postscript, he states: “I name it *The Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, for while the alchemical teachings derive from the *Yijing*, they are merely imitations and attributions—never the *Yijing*’s original meaning.” Here, right and wrong are as clear as day, and he refuses to deceive his own conscience.

The postscript further notes that this work was appended to the *Collected Explications of the Zhouyi*. His son, Yu Zhongwen, also writes in his colophon: “*The Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, in one *juan*, was composed by my late father and appended to the *Collected Explications of the Zhouyi*.” However, in the *Tongzhi Tang* edition of the *Collected Explications*, Cheng De’s preface mentions “*The Essential Compendium of Yijing Diagrams*, one *juan*, and *The Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, one *juan*, appended therein,” yet the printed edition lacks this volume. Was it initially carved into wood, only to be excised upon realizing its incongruity?

The *Catalogue of the Daoist Canon* by Bai Yunji lists this work alongside *The Comprehensive Changes of the Yijing Diagrams* and *The Comprehensive Changes of Yijing Divination*, all under the *Taiyuan* section, *Ruo* character category, and uniformly attributes them to Lei Siqi. Upon examination, Jie Xisi’s preface to Siqi’s works mentions his writings: *The Original Meaning of the Laozi*, *The Hidden Meaning of the Zhuangzi*, and *Poems on Tao Yuanming*. Wu Quanjie’s preface also notes his other collected works, but neither mentions this book. Likely, Yunji erred by grouping the three texts in the same case.

Respectfully submitted after collation in the third month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.

**Preface to *A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yijing***

*A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, one juan, by Yu Yan of the Yuan dynasty. The work contains prefaces both at its beginning and end. According to the *Suzhou Prefecture Gazetteer*, Yan, styled Yuwu, was a native of Linwu Mountain in Wu County. Born during the Baoyou reign of the Song, he was renowned for his *ci* and *fu* poetry. After the fall of the Song, he lived in reclusion, devoted to writing, and never again entered official service. Proficient in the study of the *Yijing*, he was particularly fond of playing the zither. In his later years, he styled himself the "Stone Stream Daoist" and passed away during the Zhen period of the Yuan, at the age of seventy. Among his writings, he compiled over one hundred juan of *Yijing* exegeses by various scholars, titling them *The Essential Meaning of the Great Yijing*. He also annotated forty juan, including both the upper and lower canons and the Ten Wings, under the title *Collected Explanations of the Zhouyi*. Today, only the *Collected Explanations* survives, having been printed in the *Tongzhitang* edition of *Classical Exegeses*, with *A Compendium of Yijing Diagrams* (one juan) and *A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yijing* (one juan) appended to it.

His son, Zhongwen, wrote a postscript stating: "*A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, one juan, was composed by my late father and appended to his *Collected Explanations of the Zhouyi*. My father once encountered a recluse who showed him the *Xiantian* Diagram, pointing out the mysteries of Shao Yong’s *Huanzhong* (the Center of the Circle). Thus, this book primarily elucidates Shao’s teachings." Zhongwen’s postscript is no longer extant in the present edition, but it is recorded in the *Investigation of Classical Exegeses*. Written in the sixth month after the full moon of the bingxu year of the Qianlong reign (1766), by Wu Cheng of Songli’s Xiaoyin, at the Vase-Flower Studio, at the age of sixty-five.

*A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yijing* reveals the secrets of the *Xiantian* Diagram and the *Huanzhong*—the learning of the Han Confucian Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi*. Human life between Heaven and Earth begins with the Qian (dryness) of the head and the Kun (humidity) of the abdomen, inhaling the sun and exhaling the moon, harmonizing with the single yin-yang of Heaven and Earth. The *Yijing* embodies the Dao of yin and yang, and thus Boyang borrowed the *Yijing* to clarify its principles. Its essentials are encapsulated in the *Xiantian* Diagram. Though this is but a remnant thread of the *Yijing*’s Dao, it is also a vital concern for the gentleman’s cultivation of life—something one cannot afford to be ignorant of.

The marvel of the Diagram lies in its endless cycle, beginning with Kun and ending with Fu. Its supreme subtlety, however, resides in the juncture between Kun and Fu—the interplay of movement and stillness. I once studied this, perusing the *Cloudy Satchel* and vaguely grasping a fraction of its meaning. Then, I encountered a recluse who taught me the method of reading the *Yijing*, thereby fully attaining the secrets of the *Huanzhong*. Turning inward to examine myself, I found that what Shao Kangjie (Shao Yong) called the "Great Ultimate," the "Celestial Root and Lunar Grotto," and the "Thirty-Six Palaces" were all present within. This is the *Yijing* within the body. Now, I present the Diagram as follows, accompanied by the clear and unobstructed explanations of earlier scholars. A single glance will suffice for those of insight.

Written on the full moon of the eighth month of the jiashen year of the Zhiyuan reign (1284) by Yu Yan, the Stone Stream Daoist of Guwu.

**Introduction to *A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yijing***

This book was written by Yu Shijian, a Yuan dynasty scholar, and engraved by Master Huang Houfeng of our Ming dynasty at the Jisi Temple. During the winter solstice, while residing in my studio, I retrieved and perused it. The text abounds with profound statements, such as: "At the juncture of Kun and Fu, stillness reaches its extreme and the mechanism of change arises"; "Conceal the heart in the abyss, where qi unites with spirit"; "Exquisitely harmonized and congealed, it circulates without cease"; and "Maintain fullness, govern the spirit, and sustain the true qi." All these reveal the secrets of the *Xiantian* and *Huanzhong*, wherein the alchemical terms of the Mysterious Gate—medicinal substances and fire phases—are fully embedded.

Though the text focuses on the human body, the pivot of creation can be grasped through immediate experience and broadly illustrated. I have long marveled at how practitioners of life cultivation, in their pursuit of longevity and gratification of desires, often stray into byways and crooked paths, failing to awaken to this book. It sweeps away heterodoxy and returns to the correct path. Though titled *A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yijing*, it is in truth a wing of the *Yijing*. Master Huang’s decision to engrave and preserve it was indeed purposeful.

In my earlier travels across ten thousand *li*, I devoted years to quiet cultivation. Later, I met a master who confirmed my understanding, realizing that the marvelous mechanism of yang’s generation and the true master arise from within at appointed times. Yet, I regret that my will and energy remain unmastered—neither forgetting nor forcing, I have yet to attain the effortless responsiveness that reaches its subtlety.

Now, having obtained this book and verified its truths, I am overjoyed. Thus, I write this preface and have several copies printed to share with like-minded friends, urging them to cherish and cultivate it. To those who peruse this work, I caution: do not rigidly adhere to its hexagrams or the so-called "center of zi and wu." Instead, focus solely on clarifying the spirit and nurturing qi to attain self-realization. Is this not a true seed of our Dao?

Written on the winter solstice of the xinwei year of the Longqing reign (1571) by Dong Can, the Embracing Unity Recluse.

**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**
*Yi Wai Bie Zhuan (Outer Transmissions of the Yi)*
By Yu Yan of the Yuan Dynasty

**Diagrams Included:**
- *The Heart as Supreme Ultimate*
- *Prenatal Celestial Root and Lunar Grotto*
- *Prenatal Sequence of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams*
- *Earth Receiving Heaven’s Qi*
- *The Moon Receiving the Sun’s Light*
- *Prenatal Qian Above Kun Below, Postnatal Li South Kan North*
- *Qian, Kun, Kan, Li Corresponding to Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon*
- *Eight, Seven, Nine, Six Corresponding to Wood, Fire, Metal, Water*
- *Twelve Hexagrams of Qian-Kun Interchange*
- *Twelve Hexagrams of Kan-Li Interchange*
- *Ascending and Descending Hexagrams of Inversion*
- *Fire Phases of the Cantong Qi Vessel*
- *Prenatal Diagram*

The *Cantong Qi* states: "From Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning, it is like tracing a linked ring." Shao Kangjie’s poem says:
*"Ever since I grasped the ring’s central intent,
My chest has been at ease—one care dispelled."*
And again:
*"When Qian meets Xun, observe the Lunar Grotto;
Where earth meets thunder, see the Celestial Root.
Celestial Root and Lunar Grotto—idly coming and going,
Thirty-six palaces are all spring."*

I say: The Lunar Grotto lies above, the Celestial Root below; that which comes and goes between them is the heart. What are the "thirty-six palaces"? Qian is one, Dui two, Li three, Zhen four, Xun five, Kan six, Gen seven, Kun eight—these are they. "Thirty-six palaces are all spring" means harmonious qi circulating throughout the body. Thus, the thirty-six palaces are not in some distant realm but within our very selves. This Dao was known to Shao Kangjie and Zhu Ziyang, but not to vulgar Confucians.

Shao Kangjie’s *Huangji Jingshi Shu* states: "The Prenatal Diagram is the ring’s center." I say: The human body itself is the Prenatal Diagram. The heart resides at the body’s center, just as the Supreme Ultimate lies at the Prenatal Diagram’s core. Zhu Ziyang called this "the empty space in the middle." The diagram begins with Fu and ends with Kun, its end and beginning linked like a ring—hence the name "ring." The ring’s center is where the sixty-four hexagrams encircle its outer edge while the Supreme Ultimate dwells within. In the *Yi*, this is the Supreme Ultimate; in humans, it is the heart. If one knows the heart as the Supreme Ultimate, one may speak of the Dao.

It further states: "After the winter solstice comes exhalation; after the summer solstice comes inhalation—this is Heaven and Earth’s yearly breath." Zhu Ziyang said: "Between Heaven and Earth, there is only one qi. From this year’s winter solstice to next year’s winter solstice is but a single breath: exhalation is yang, inhalation is yin." I say: After the winter solstice, from Fu to Qian, it belongs to yang—hence exhalation. After the summer solstice, from Gou to Kun, it belongs to yin—hence inhalation. Exhalation is qi’s emergence, thus belonging to the period after the winter solstice; inhalation is qi’s return, thus belonging to the period after the summer solstice. In the grand scale, this is Heaven and Earth’s yearly breath; in the small scale, it is the human body’s single breath. The *Cantong Qi* states: "The dragon exhales, the tiger inhales; the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence." And again: "Exhalation and inhalation nurture each other; at rest, they become husband and wife." All metaphors in the thousand classics and ten thousand treatises ultimately boil down to these two words: exhalation and inhalation.

It further states: "One movement, one stillness—is this not Heaven and Earth’s utmost subtlety? Between one movement and one stillness—is this not the utmost subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity?" Zhu Ziyang said: "The diagram’s left belongs to yang, its right to yin." I say: The diagram’s left, from Fu to Qian, is yang’s movement; its right, from Gou to Kun, is yin’s stillness. Between one movement and one stillness lies the transition from Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning—the union of yin and yang. In a year, this is the winter solstice; in a month, it is the transition between the last and first days; in a day, it is the juncture between the end of Hai and the beginning of Zi. Meng Kang said: "Between Zi’s west and Hai’s east lies its center." I say: Within our bodies, Qian and Kun internally intermingle; when stillness reaches its extreme, the mechanism stirs and resonates with Heaven and Earth’s utmost pole. This is truly the utmost subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.

It further states: "Utterly still and unmoving—this is Kun’s image of no yang. Moved and thus penetrating all things under Heaven—this is yang stirring within, Fu’s meaning." I say: Stillness is the extreme of quietude—this is Kun, pure yin. Movement is the beginning of activity—this is Fu, the birth of yang. Between stillness and movement lies the space between one movement and one stillness.

It further states: "Before the Limitless, yin contains yang; after the appearance of images, yang divides yin." Zhu Ziyang said: "Shaozi’s explanation of the diagram’s cyclical nature: from Gou to Kun is yin containing yang; from Fu to Qian is yang dividing yin. Between Kun and Fu lies the Limitless’s mechanism." Zhong said: "Zhuzi’s statement that between Kun and Fu lies the Limitless is most discerning." And in a poem:
*"Suddenly, at midnight, a clap of thunder—
Ten thousand households, a thousand gates open in succession.
If you recognize the image contained within the imageless,
Xuanyuan himself may come to meet you."*
The image contained within the imageless is precisely the space between Kun and Fu—the Limitless containing the Supreme Ultimate. Who but Zhuzi could have elucidated Shaozi’s learning?

Shao Kangjie’s *Winter Solstice Chant* says:
*"At the winter solstice, Zi’s midpoint,
Heaven’s heart remains unchanged.
Where the first yang stirs,
All things are yet unborn.
Fine wine tastes faint,
The grand tone’s sound is rare."*
If you doubt these words, ask Fuxi again.
And:
*"What is called the Celestial Root?
Its principle is most subtle.
At the year’s end,
When the next day begins—
This moment is easily grasped in intent,
But hard to describe in words.
If one knows this intent,
What else could one not know?"*
Another poem, harmonizing with Academician Wei:
*"Each time I read to the Celestial Root,
I fear the masters will ask of its utmost mystery."*

Zhu Ziyang said: "Zi’s midpoint is when it is not yet fully Zi, just departing from Hai." And again: "Where the first yang stirs lies between zhen and yuan." I say: This is precisely the true mechanism of creation. Cheng Yichuan said: "Without stealing the mechanism of creation, how could one attain longevity?" How profound these words!

Shao Kangjie’s *Huanhu Chant* says:
*"Huanhu—yin and yang’s first transformation,
Yinyun—Heaven and Earth’s initial rotation.
Amidst it, a fleeting glimpse of fine scenery—
How to refine one’s skill to express it?"*
I say: Kangjie’s poem reveals the Celestial Root’s utmost mystery. Without personally entering the huanhu’s realm or truly reaching the yinyun’s domain, how could one know it as the utmost mystery?

Shao Kangjie’s *Huangji Jingshi Shu* states: "Heaven and Earth’s root—does it not arise from the center? Thus, though Qian and Kun repeatedly transform, they never depart from the center." And again: "From below to above is called ascending; from above to below is called descending. Ascending is generation; descending is dissolution. Thus, yang is born below, yin above—hence all things are born in reverse." And again: "Yin generates yang, yang generates yin; yin again generates yang, yang again generates yin—thus it cycles endlessly."

The *Qian-Kun Chant* further states:
"The Dao is not distant from man—
Qian and Kun reside only within the body.
Who seeks Qian and Kun beyond the heavens and earth?"

I say: Qian and Kun are the pure yin and yang; Kan and Li are the intermingled yin and yang. Qian, pure yang, is Heaven and thus resides above the center. Kun, pure yin, is Earth and thus resides below the center. Kan, yin containing yang, is the Moon; Li, yang containing yin, is the Sun—hence they dwell between Qian and Kun. The remaining sixty hexagrams begin with the rise of one yang within Kun, ascending until five yangs form the ultimate ascent, becoming the pure six yangs of Qian. Conversely, they begin with the rise of one yin within Qian, descending until five yins form the ultimate descent, becoming the pure six yins of Kun. This ascent and descent, this upward and downward movement, cycles endlessly.

Heaven and Earth are thus—so too is the human body. At the *zi* hour, qi reaches the *weilu*; at *chou* and *yin*, it resides in the waist; at *mao* and *chen*, along the spine; at *wu*, in the *niwan*; at *wei*, *shen*, and *you*, in the chest and diaphragm; at *xu* and *hai*, it returns to the abdomen—such is the daily ascent and descent. Each breath follows the same pattern: inhalation ascends from below, exhalation descends from above. In the heavens, this corresponds to the stars, as the Dipper points to *zi* and *wu*; on Earth, it corresponds to the tides, like the moon at *zi* and *wu*—for these are the center of Heaven and Earth.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "Harmonize the tally, move within the center," and again, "Though movements shift, the center is never lost," and further, "Float the raft, guard the compass’s center." If one knows the center within one’s body to align with the center of Heaven and Earth, then Qian and Kun are not in Heaven and Earth but within one’s own body. How could I find a companion of the round mechanism to discuss the Qian and Kun within the body and thoroughly explore the center within it?

Alas! The *Yi* says: "Supreme is Kun’s origin! All things rely on it for birth, thus it compliantly follows Heaven." The *Cantong Qi* states: "Ever compliant with Earth’s principles, it receives Heaven’s decree and spreads its proclamation."

I say: The human primordial qi is stored in the abdomen, just as all things are stored in Kun. The spirit enters the Earth’s center, just as Heaven’s qi descends to Earth. Qi and spirit unite, just as Earth’s Dao compliantly follows Heaven. Heaven and Earth generate beings through this; our bodies produce the elixir through this. The *Tai Xuan Jing* states: "Conceal the heart in the abyss, beautifying its numinous root"—this is of the same principle.

Shao Kangjie said: "The Moon’s body is inherently dark; it receives the Sun’s light and becomes bright."

I say: The Sun is the Great Yang; the Moon is the Great Yin. The Moon has no light of its own—its light is the Sun’s light. Yang is luminous; yin is dark. Yang bestows; yin receives. Thus, the Great Yin receives the Great Yang’s light to become bright. The human heart is the Great Yang; the *qi* sea is like the Great Yin. When the heart is settled, the spirit congeals; when the spirit congeals, qi gathers. If one can congeal the spirit into the qi, then qi and spirit unite—no different from the Great Yin receiving the Great Yang’s light.

Shao Kangjie said: "The spirit connects to the heart; qi is governed by the kidneys; form is governed by the head. When form and qi interact, the spirit presides over their center—this is the Dao of the Three Powers."

I say: Within the human body, the head is Qian, the abdomen is Kun, and the heart resides between them—its position is like the Three Powers. Qi is governed by the kidneys; form is governed by the head. Originally, the upper and lower do not interact—what enables their interaction is the spirit. When the spirit moves within the center, above and below merge, flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth—is this not the Dao of the Three Powers?

When the spirit guards the kidneys, it is still and hidden—this is Kun’s Dao. When it guards the head, it moves and circulates—this is Qian’s Dao. Stillness and concealment achieve wondrous union and congealment; movement and circulation achieve ceaseless flow. The congealed is the medicine; the ceaseless flow is the fire.

The *Yin Fu Jing* states: "The mechanism lies in the eyes."

Shao Kangjie said: "Heaven’s spirit manifests in the Sun; man’s spirit manifests in the eyes."

I say: Where the eyes go, the heart follows. Thus, the method of inner refinement is to direct the eyes to the nose, the nose to the navel, lowering the heart-fire into the *qi* sea—this requires but a moment’s effort.

The *Yi* states: "Qian is Heaven; Kun is Earth. Li is the Sun; Kan is the Moon." And again: "Qian is the head; Kun is the abdomen."

The *Tai Xuan Jing* states: "Yang qi secretly sprouts in the Yellow Palace."

The *Huangting Jing* states: "If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun." And again: "Exhale the Sun, inhale the Moon; maintain breath and storage."

I say: The head is above and round, the convergence of all yangs—this is Qian’s Heavenly image, so the *Yi* takes Qian as the head. Kunlun is in the northwest, Qian’s position, so the *Huangting Jing* takes Qian as Kunlun. The abdomen is below and hollow, the gathering place of the eight vessels—this is Kun’s Earthly image, so the *Yi* takes Kun as the abdomen. Heaven is mysterious; Earth is yellow, so the *Tai Xuan* takes Kun as the Yellow Palace. The Sun rises in the east; the Moon rises in the west, so the *Yi* takes Li as the Sun and Kan as the Moon. Breathing—exhalation and inhalation, ascent and descent, upward and downward movement—is endless, so the *Huangting Jing* takes breathing as the Sun and Moon. Some take the two eyes as the Sun and Moon, but this is incorrect: the two eyes merely have the *form* of the Sun and Moon, not their *function*.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "Nine returns, seven reverts, eight returns, six resides," and again, "Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond," and further, "Where metal and water unite, wood and fire are companions. These four, in primordial chaos, array as dragon and tiger."

I say: Six, seven, eight, and nine are the completion numbers of water, fire, wood, and metal. Wood’s number is eight, belonging to the east; fire’s number is seven, belonging to the south. Wood rises from the east and becomes fire’s companion in the south. Metal’s number is nine, belonging to the west; water’s number is six, belonging to the north. Metal descends from the west and unites with water in the north.

Alchemists speak of the "Red Dragon" and "Black Tiger": the Azure Dragon of the east’s seven lodges moves to the south and becomes the Red Dragon; the White Tiger of the west’s seven lodges moves to the north and becomes the Black Tiger. All are metaphors for the body’s breathing. In the end, what dragon or tiger is there? What metal, water, wood, or fire? What seven, eight, nine, or six? All are metaphors.

Some doubt: "Nine, seven, and eight speak of returning, while six alone speaks of residing—is this not inconsistent?"

I say: Six resides in the north, unmoving. The returns of the three directions all gather in the north—hence it is called "residing."

Qian above and Kun below are the Heaven and Earth of our body. *Tai* on the left and *Pi* on the right are the ascent and descent of our body’s Heaven and Earth. *Fu* is not the eleventh month, nor is it the midnight *zi* hour—it is the *zi* within the body. *Gou* is not the fifth month, nor is it the noon *wu* hour—it is the *wu* within the body.

Zhang Wuzhen said: "When *Pi* and *Tai* interact, yin and yang either ascend or descend"—this refers to the *Pi* and *Tai* within the body.

Kan in the north and Li in the south are the water and fire of our body. *Jiji* in the east and *Weiji* in the west are the ascent and descent of our body’s water and fire. *Zhun* resides in *yin*; *Dun* resides in *xu*—these are the fire timings of our body. *Yin* is not early morning; it is the *yin* within the body. *Xu* is not dusk; it is the *xu* within the body.

Zhang Wuzhen said: "*Zhun* and *Dun* act as movement and stillness, at dawn and dusk"—this refers to the *Zhun* and *Dun* within the body.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "At dawn’s first light, *Zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *Dun* assumes its charge. Day and night each employ one hexagram, following their sequence. When the cycle nears its end at dim twilight, it begins anew. The celestial stems and earthly branches serve as its measure. Movement and stillness vary in their timing—spring and summer govern the inner body from *zi* to *chen* and *si*, while autumn and winter govern the outer from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*."

I humbly observe: The *Cantong Qi* takes *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible, *Kan* and *Li* as the elixir, and uses the remaining sixty hexagrams to mark the *fire phases*. Each day has twelve hours, two hexagrams accounting for twelve lines—hence it speaks of employing two hexagrams: at dawn *Zhun*, at dusk *Dun*; at dawn *Xu*, at dusk *Song*, and so on through *Jiji* and *Weiji*, all as one. When *Zhun* is inverted, it becomes *Dun*, presenting the image of ascent and descent: *Zhun* rises from within, governing dawn, day, spring, and summer; *Dun* descends from without, governing dusk, night, autumn, and winter. All hexagrams follow this pattern. The sixty hexagrams are distributed across thirty days to mirror a lunar month, but what of shorter months? This is but a metaphor, not a literal thirty days. Some mistake this for a method of closing the eyes and counting breaths—how tedious and laborious! How could this be the Dao of utmost simplicity and ease?

The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*’s diagram of the Golden Elixir’s crucible, ingredients, and *fire phases*—though myriad in form, they share a single source. This wondrous art, so precise and unerring, was inscribed for countless ages to come, shining as brightly as the starry canon of Han, resplendent as the ancestral sea. Ponder it deeply, commit it to mastery, and turn it over in your mind a thousand times, up and down, until after ten thousand repetitions its brilliance becomes clear. Then the numinous may reveal itself to you, and your heart-mind will suddenly awaken. Trace its threads, seek its beginnings, and you will find its gate and threshold. The Dao of Heaven is impartial—it is ever transmitted to the worthy.

—Appended is the *Mingjing Tu* of Peng Zhenyi, slightly revised to form the *Nine Cycles*.

The *Yi* says: "The heavens move with vigor; the noble person ceaselessly strengthens the self."

Hu Anding remarked: "The form of Heaven appears azure when viewed from afar. The southern pivot dips thirty-six degrees below the earth, while the northern pivot rises thirty-six degrees above it, resembling an inclined pestle—this is the shape of Heaven. In terms of its function, in a single day and night it traverses over nine hundred thousand *li*. With each human breath—one inhalation and exhalation constituting one *xi*—Heaven moves over eighty *li*. In one day and night, as Heaven travels nine hundred thousand *li*, its vigorous function becomes evident." He further stated: "When a person’s *shen* and *qi* are gathered, life endures; when they scatter, life perishes. Heaven possesses the unyielding *yang* *qi*, circulating without cease, and thus its body remains eternal."

I humbly note: The *Cantong Qi* says, "The *guanjian* rise and fall, and the *zhoutian* rushes forth." *Guanjian* refers to the north and south celestial poles; *zhoutian* refers to the twenty-eight constellations; *benzou* refers to their movement. Heaven moves like a slung pellet, revolving ceaselessly day and night. Its north and south poles—one high, one low—form the *guanjian*. The human body is the same: above lies the *Celestial Pass*, below the *Earthly Axis*. If one can revolve the *Celestial Pass* and turn the *Earthly Axis*, then with each breath, the *zhoutian* completes one cycle.

I further note: The *Cantong Qi* states, "Following the turning *xuanji*, ascending and descending, above and below." The *xuanji* is the Dipper. Heaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism; humans use the heart as theirs. The heart’s movement within the body is like the Dipper’s movement in the heavens.

I further note: The *Yinfu Jing* says, "Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movement of Heaven—this is perfection." For the Dao of humanity and the Dao of Heaven are one. If a person can withdraw their gaze, return their hearing, conceal their heart-mind in the abyss, and govern the ebb and flow of breath to circulate without cease, then they move in harmony with the Dao of Heaven, and the mechanism of Heaven’s movement is theirs to grasp. Yet though the Dao of Heaven may be observed and its movement seen, grasping it is not easy. Who can grasp it? Only those with an empty heart-mind.

The *Yi* says: "The noble person is centered in the yellow, penetrating in principle, rightly positioned in the body. Beauty resides within and flows to the four limbs, manifesting in deeds and undertakings—this is the height of beauty."

Xu Jinzhai remarked: "Alchemists also draw from this meaning. Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* speaks of the *yellow center* gradually penetrating principle, moistening and reaching the skin and flesh—though the application differs, this pertains to the nourishment of principle, a gift bestowed by Heaven. That pertains to the preservation of blood and *qi*, a matter of personal cultivation."

I humbly note: The intent of the *Cantong Qi* is merely to borrow the Dao of the *Yi* to elucidate its own meaning. The passages it cites from the *Yi* do not necessarily adhere to their original significance. For the *Yi* resembles Heaven and Earth, and the human body also resembles Heaven and Earth. Thus Wei Boyang used the *Yi* to compose the *Cantong Qi*, with the *yellow center* referring to the *yellow path* within the body.

The *Yi* says: "Not far off is the return; there is no great remorse—supremely auspicious."

Zhu Ziyang stated: "Laozi said, 'In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.' Only frugality is called *early service*; *early service* is termed *accumulating virtue*. Other texts explain that *early service* means acting promptly. *Accumulating virtue* means one has already accumulated and further nurtures it with frugality. For those who cultivate and nourish themselves, if the body has not yet suffered loss and one adds frugal nurturing, this is *early service* and *accumulating virtue*. If one waits until damage has occurred before nurturing, the nurturing merely suffices to repair the loss—it cannot be called *accumulating virtue*. Thus *early service* is prized: it is early awareness, nurturing before loss occurs. Like my own body, now worn and depleted, resembling a dilapidated house—propped up here, collapsing there—though I wish to cultivate and nourish, what benefit can there be? This year, I received a letter from Cai Jitong, who has lately gained deep insight into the principles of nourishing life and mastered its methods. Yet his 'city walls are incomplete'—there is nowhere to apply his skill. It seems this is indeed the case."

I humbly note: The *Youji Xianji* records that Zhou Cong was a native of Sizhou. Xu Shenweng held him in high regard, saying, "I married young, but this man attained the Dao in his youth. His spirit is whole—I cannot compare." Such a one as Zhou Cong may well be what Laozi meant by *early service* and *accumulating virtue*.

I further note: The *Suwen* states: "At eight years of age, a boy’s *kidney qi* solidifies, his hair grows, and his teeth change. At sixteen, his *kidney qi* flourishes, *tian gui* arrives, his *essence* overflows, and with the harmony of yin and yang, he can father children. At twenty-four, his *kidney qi* is balanced, his sinews and bones are strong, his permanent teeth grow, and he reaches full stature. At thirty-two, his sinews and bones are robust, his flesh and bones full. At forty, his *kidney qi* declines, his hair falls, and his teeth wither. At forty-eight, the *yang qi* at the surface is exhausted, his face withers, his hair and beard turn white. At fifty-six, his *liver qi* weakens, his sinews cannot move, *tian gui* is exhausted, his *essence* diminishes, his *kidney* storehouse declines, and his body reaches its limit. At sixty-four, his teeth and hair are gone." It further states: "The people of high antiquity who understood the Dao modeled themselves on yin and yang, harmonized with arts and calculations, regulated their eating and drinking, maintained regularity in rising and resting, and did not recklessly exert themselves. Thus they could unite form and spirit and live out their Heaven-appointed years, reaching a hundred before passing. The people of today are not like this."

They take wine as their broth and recklessness as their norm, entering drunk into the bedchamber, using desire to exhaust their essence and dissipate their true qi. Unaware of how to maintain fullness, untimely in governing their spirit, they pursue the quick gratification of their hearts, drowning in pleasures of life, and rising and resting without regularity—thus they decline by fifty.

I say: when people reach old age, they often become forgetful and their spirit grows dim; this is why. When they move, they become fatigued and their qi declines; this is why. The Dao of inner refinement takes spirit and qi as its root. If the spirit is dim and qi declines, what then can serve as its root?

The *Yi* says: "Water flows ceaselessly, filling the *Kan* trigram." I note: The *Lingshu Jing* states that the sun travels through the twenty-eight lunar lodges, and the human meridians—up and down, left and right, front and back—comprise twenty-eight vessels, totaling sixteen *zhang* and two *chi* in length, corresponding to the twenty-eight lodges. A water clock drips one hundred *ke* to divide day and night. Thus, with each exhalation, the pulse moves and qi travels three *cun*; with each inhalation, the pulse moves again, and qi travels another three *cun*. In one complete breath, qi travels six *cun*. In ten breaths, qi travels six *chi*. In a day, it travels two *fen*, and in 270 breaths, qi travels sixteen *zhang* and two *chi*, circulating through the center and completing one cycle around the body as two *ke* of water drip. In a day, it travels twenty-five *fen*, and in 540 breaths, qi completes two cycles around the body as four *ke* of water drip. In a day, it travels forty *fen*, and in 2,700 breaths, qi completes ten cycles around the body as twenty *ke* of water drip. In a day, it travels five lodges and twenty *fen*, and in 13,500 breaths, qi completes fifty cycles around the body as one hundred *ke* of water drip. The day has passed through the twenty-eight lodges, the water clock is exhausted, and the pulse’s journey ends—altogether, it has traveled 810 *zhang*.

It further states: "The movement of qi is like the flow of water, like the ceaseless motion of the sun and moon. Thus, the yin vessels nourish the viscera, and the yang vessels nourish the bowels, circulating endlessly like a ring without beginning or end." I say: when the qi and blood of the human body flow smoothly, one is at peace; if there is any blockage, illness arises. The Dao of inner refinement ensures that each breath follows the last, like water flowing ceaselessly, so that true qi ascends and descends, irrigating the body just as water flows unimpeded.

The *Yi* says: "*Kan* is water, is the moon; *Li* is fire, is the sun." Xiang Ping’an said: "The heart takes *Kan* as its substance and *Li* as its function, so the heart desires emptiness and clarity. The kidneys take *Li* as their substance and *Kan* as their function, so the *dantian* desires fullness and warmth. In reduction and augmentation, all pertain to the three yangs: the fire of *Li* in reduction flies upward, while the fire of augmentation lies concealed below." He also said: "The fire of *Li*’s substance ascends, hence reduction; the fire of *Li*’s substance abides below, hence augmentation."

I say: the Dao of inner refinement is utterly simple and easy—it merely desires the descent of the heart’s fire into the *dantian*. The *dantian* lies behind the navel and before the kidneys, precisely in the center of the abdomen. Alchemists avoid speaking of the heart and kidneys, calling them not *Kan* and *Li*, but instead referring to breathing as *Kan* and *Li*. Yet they fail to consider that breathing is the function of *Kan* and *Li*, while the heart and kidneys are their substance. In the human body, the heart is the ruler, thus it alone resides in the center; the kidneys are the foundation, thus they alone reside below. Alchemists do not speak of the heart and kidneys but instead speak of the "body-heart," where the "body" is the abdomen and the kidneys lie within it—how can one abandon the kidneys? The kidneys belong to water, the heart to fire. When fire enters water, water and fire unite in marriage, like the conjunction of the sun and moon between the last and first days of the lunar month.

The *Yi* says: "Mountain and marsh exchange qi," and "The two qi respond to one another and interact." I note: The *Cantong Qi* states: "What is natural is not false or deceptive. The Dao is like the qi of mountain and marsh steaming together, rising as clouds and becoming rain." When the yin and yang of the human body intertwine and conjoin in the *dantian*, they ascend to the *niwan* and billow like clouds, transforming into sweet rain. Chen Xiyi’s poem says: "Suddenly the fire-wheel sears the earth’s veins; startlingly, the divine spring gushes from the mountain’s peak." This is the same principle. The "divine spring" in the *Liezi* refers to the exchange of qi between mountain and marsh, which occurs because of their emptiness. Only when empty can the two qi respond and interact; if not empty, they become obstructed and cannot communicate. How then can they interact? The Dao of inner refinement values the emptiness of the heart. When the heart is empty, the spirit congeals; when the spirit congeals, qi gathers; when qi gathers, clouds rise and rain falls—just like the mountain and marsh.

The *Li Sao*’s "Far Roaming" says: "The Dao can be received but cannot be transmitted. Its smallness has no inside, its greatness no bounds. Do not disturb your soul, for it will naturally become one with the spirit. In the middle of the night, preserve emptiness and await it—do not act before it." Zhu Ziyang’s commentary states: "The advice of Guangchengzi to the Yellow Emperor was nothing more than this—truly the essential secret of immortals."

The *Yi* says: "Opening and closing are called change; ceaseless coming and going are called penetration." Cheng Yichuan said: "The Dao of self-cultivation lies in the mechanism of exhalation and inhalation—opening and closing." He also said: "Opening and closing, coming and going, are seen in the breath of the nose." Zhang Hengqu said: "The breath of humans is the image of the mutual grinding of hardness and softness, the opening and closing of *Qian* and *Kun*." Zhu Ziyang’s *Tiaoxi Zhen* says: "The subtle mystery of *yinyun* opening and closing is boundless—who presides over it? It is the achievement of non-action."

I note: The *Cantong Qi* states: "The two functions have no fixed position; they circulate through the six voids. Coming and going are not constant; above and below have no permanence. They hide and sink, transforming within." The two functions are the nine and six; the six voids are the six lines of the hexagrams. This illustrates how each exhalation and inhalation, coming and going, rising and falling, over time congeals the spirit and settles the breath, thereby accomplishing transformation. Exhalation is the opening of yang; inhalation is the closing of yin. The yin and yang of the human body resemble those of heaven and earth. If one can guide the breath up and down, making it circulate ceaselessly, then the subtle mystery of opening and closing, coming and going, is entirely within one’s own body.

Some say: there is great opening and closing, and small opening and closing. The opening and closing of one breath is the opening and closing of one *ke*; the opening and closing of one *ke* is the opening and closing of one hour; the opening and closing of one hour is the opening and closing of one day; the opening and closing of one day is the opening and closing of one month; the opening and closing of one month is the opening and closing of one year; and so on to the opening and closing of a lifetime, of one cosmic cycle, of ten thousand ages—the principle is the same.

The *Yi* says: "As the sun goes, the moon comes; as the moon goes, the sun comes. Sun and moon push one another, and brightness is born. As cold goes, heat comes; as heat goes, cold comes. Cold and heat push one another, and the year is completed." Cheng Yichuan said: "The *Yi* speaks only of reversal and recurrence, coming and going, rising and falling." I say: the books of alchemists use broad analogies and elaborate metaphors, but they too speak only of reversal and recurrence, coming and going, rising and falling. Beyond this, all is heterodox teaching and reckless practice—it is not the true and natural Dao.

I note that *Wenzi* says: "Flowing water does not stagnate because it moves; the pivot of a door does not rot because it turns." *Wenzi* is Jiran, a man of the Zhou and a disciple of Laozi. The qi and blood of the human body likewise desire movement and circulation—if they do not circulate, minor blockage becomes a boil, major blockage an abscess. A boil is a knot; an abscess is a congestion; an ulcer is an obstruction.

I further note that *Zihuazi* says: "The ancients who knew the Dao built ramparts to guard against evil and dredged channels to nurture the true. They dwelt in deep stillness, untroubled by external things. Their breath moved in and out in harmony with spirit and qi. The hun and po guarded their precincts, sealing all openings. Single-minded and undivided, their true qi was preserved. Above and below, it poured and irrigated, circulating like flowing water, like the ceaseless movement of sun and moon. Yin nourished the viscera; yang fortified the bowels. The source and stream flowed abundantly, full yet never overflowing, surging yet never brimming—this is what is called enduring life." *Zihuazi* is Cheng Ben, with whom Confucius once conversed at length after their chariots met on the road.

The qi and blood of the human body circulate ceaselessly through above and below, day and night, like the waters of rivers and streams. People see only that the waters of rivers and streams flow eastward to the sea without exhaustion, yet they do not know that the great mountains and rivers, the caverns and hollows, all communicate. Have you not seen the waterfall of Mount Lu? Day and night it pours without cease—why? Because water flows through the earth, circulating in endless return. The movement of the sun and moon is the same: following the turning of heaven, they emerge and enter, come and go without end. If one knows that the sun and moon within one’s own body likewise circulate without cease, then the wonder of endless return lies within oneself and need not be sought in the distant and remote.

Medical texts say: the human body has the *Ren* and *Du* vessels. The *Ren* vessel begins below the *Zhongji* point, ascends through the pubic hair, follows the interior of the abdomen up to *Guanyuan*, reaches the throat, and belongs to the sea of yin vessels. The *Du* vessel begins at the *Xiaji* point, runs alongside the spine up to *Fengfu*, enters the brain, ascends to the crown, follows the forehead to the bridge of the nose, and belongs to the sea of yang vessels. It is called the *Ren* vessel because women rely on it for pregnancy and nourishment. It is called the *Du* vessel because it supervises and governs the sea of vessels. The deer circulates qi at the *Weilü* point, thus unblocking the *Du* vessel. The tortoise draws breath through its nose, thus unblocking the *Ren* vessel. If one can unblock these two vessels, then all vessels are unblocked. The *Huangting Jing* says: "All operate within the heart, circulating the celestial meridian. Preserve it day and night, and you will naturally attain long life." The celestial meridian is the yellow path of one’s own body; the breath moves in and out through it—these are the *Ren* and *Du* vessels.

Here, appended to the *Collected Explications of the Zhouyi*, is a separate volume titled *A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yi*, complete with diagrams and explanations. It unfolds the ultimate mystery of the *Primordial Diagram Within the Circle*, verifying it with the *Cantong Qi*, the *Yinfu Jing*, and other texts, and corroborates it with the profound teachings of Cheng Yi, Zhang Zai, and other Confucians. Thus it elucidates what Zhu Xi left unsaid and extends the implications beyond Shao Yong’s words. Though I have not had the leisure to devote myself exclusively to this pursuit, the wondrous workings of the elixir are not merely matters of superficial knowledge—I have tested them in practice. Therefore, I dare to point directly to what alchemists have guarded most closely, dispelling the confusions of learners.

I have often lamented that the books of alchemists are filled with obscure words and convoluted phrases, leaving readers without a crevice to enter. Often, they read until their eyes blur and their hearts break, then close the book with a long sigh. Cai Jitong and Xu Jizhong once collaborated with Zhu Xi to revise the *Cantong Qi*. Though they could examine its words and meanings, they did not grasp its essential truth and could only speculate. Now that I have obtained what I sought, how could I bear to remain silent and keep it for myself? Thus I have written this book and appended it to the *Collected Explications of the Zhouyi*, naming it *A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yi*. For though the teachings of alchemists derive from the *Yi*, they are but imitations and allusions—never the *Yi*’s original meaning. The details are recorded in the *Cantong Qi* and its *Explications* in three chapters; here I will not repeat them.

Written by Yu Yan of Shijian.

The Yuan Confucian Hu Shuanghu once composed *Wings to the Zhouyi* in three chapters and compiled the *Grand Mystery*, the *Cantong Qi*, and the *Dongji* into an outer volume. Yu of Shijian also wrote *Essentials of the Great Yi* and *Collected Explications of the Zhouyi*, drawing on the secrets of the *Primordial Diagram Within the Circle* and the teachings of Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* to create *A Separate Transmission Beyond the Yi*. Their engagement with the *Yi* can truly be called comprehensive.

The *Wings* was printed and circulated by bookshops; the *Essentials* and *Collected Explications* were once printed in Suzhou but are no longer seen. This *Separate Transmission Beyond the Yi* was a gift from my friend Xu Yiyuan Ao, also printed in Suzhou. It elucidates Shao Yong’s teachings extensively and is of great aid to the *Yi*. As Zhu Xi said: "There is nothing not contained in the *Yi*. If a teaching forms a coherent system and can be extended and applied, then it does no harm to the *Yi*."

Yet the world often seeks it mistakenly among cinnabar and furnace fires. Shijian’s writings include *Elucidations on the Cantong Qi*, but since it bears no connection to the *Yi*, it is not discussed here again. Written in the *xinsi* year of the Zhengde era (1521) by Huang Gong of Puyang at the Thatched Hall of Wanshan.
