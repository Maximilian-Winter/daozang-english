# 老子衍

**Wang Fuzhi’s *Expounding the Laozi*: Preface**

Those who annotated the *Laozi* in former times belonged to different schools, each transmitting divergent interpretations. By the time of Wang Bi and He Yan, they conflated it with the *Book of Changes*’ principles of qian and kun, simplicity and ease; Kumārajīva and Emperor Wu of Liang diluted it with the Buddhist doctrines of cause and effect in affairs and principles. Such forced patchwork and arbitrary synthesis have long been distortions. Down to Lu Xisheng, Su Ziyou, Dong Sijing, and more recently Jiao Hong and Li Zhi, they increasingly drew from Chan Buddhism, stitching it together with Laozi’s teachings, blending what they called "a special transmission outside the teachings." This is like the people of Min mistaking frost for snow, or those of Luo peeling a *pengqi* upon hearing of eating crabs.

Laozi himself said: "Carry your *po* and embrace the One without separation," "The great Dao overflows, drifting left or right," and "Use the harmonizing *qi* of the void." These are Laozi’s own explanations. Zhuangzi said: "Do good without seeking fame, do evil without courting punishment, follow the central path as your constant." This is Zhuangzi’s elucidation of Laozi.

To abandon these clear expositions and forcibly align Confucianism with the Dao is to slander the Confucians; to forcibly align the Dao with Buddhism is to slander the Dao. Such interpreters drive worldly teachings to serve their own doctrines of "turning away from dust and merging consciousness," becoming pests that endure. How can this be tolerated?

Having long examined these distortions, I now set aside all previous schools to expound Laozi’s meaning. It is like entering their fortress, seizing their supplies, exposing their defenses, and revealing their flaws. Only by seeing their flaws can the Dao be restored.

What, then, are these flaws? Those who discourse on the Dao often provoke the vulgar by deliberately opposing them—this is unjust; they seize upon partial insights and cling to them—this is unprincipled; they hack at wisdom and flaunt it—this is inauspicious. Laozi’s teachings suffer from all three errors. Thus, compared to the sagely Dao, which is adorned with ritual and music to establish the ultimate of central harmony, Laozi’s depth is insufficient.

Nevertheless, as the world shifts and the Dao is lost, collapse and ruin follow in quick succession. Those who cling to texts drift into hypocrisy and theft; those who obscure the subtle portents become harbingers of disaster. Rulers who govern the world stir up trouble to exhaust the people; those who seize the world deplete their strength and wisdom to ruin their subjects. If we probe Laozi’s subtleties to await the Dao’s self-restoration, there is still hope. The rise of Emperors Wen and Jing led to lasting peace; Zhang Zifang and Sun Zhonghe, though differing in their pursuits, averted peril. Such is the use of this teaching. Compared to Buddhism’s desolate harshness, which ultimately leads to entanglement in thorns, recklessly discarding the principles of things to seek fleeting marvels, is this not the wiser path?

Sima Qian said: "Laozi practiced non-action and transformed naturally; he purified himself and rectified naturally." This is close to the truth. As for the "like a dragon" praise attributed to Confucius’ disciples, what value does it hold?

Written in the year *zhanmeng xieqia*, the eighth month, day *yiwei*, by Wang Fuzhi of Nanyue.

**Chapter One**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
*[The eternal Dao is without Dao.]*
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
*[The eternal name is without name.]*
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth;
*[All names arise from it, yet it cannot be named by any single name.]*
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
*[Names are established by things, and names in turn generate things.]*
Thus, in constant non-being, one observes its mystery;
In constant being, one observes its manifestations.
*[Its boundaries.]*
These two emerge together but differ in name.
*[Different observations of the same constant: whether with desire or without, one does not divide the mind to respond. Abiding in the center and holding to the constant, one naturally attains the observation of mystery and manifestation.]*
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and again profound—
The gate of all mysteries.

**Commentary on Chapter One**

What is "can be" is not "eternal"; what is "eternal" has no "can be." Yet if we rely on the "eternal," then the "eternal" is one "can be." Thus, the "eternal" is not abandoned, yet there is nothing that "can be." By not abandoning the "eternal," human mechanisms are connected; by having nothing that "can be," the harmony of heaven is unified.

Since there is already a "beginning" and a "mother," I casually "observe" them. To "observe" is to ride upon their inevitability. Observing their "difference," there are countless transformations; observing their "sameness," what exists arises later, and what is non-existent is not the great beginning. Thus, those who respond by going forth see difference; those who abide and await see sameness.

Therefore, one consumes the ten thousand things without claiming benevolence; one enters the realm of artifice without encountering its sharpness. Knowing the world’s conditions, one does not force others to serve oneself; discarding one’s own excess, one does not cling to the old to confuse the new.

Thus, none can name its achievement, yet we style it "the host of mysteries"—for in dwelling within the grasp of meaning, opening the gate to traverse the hundred transformations of life and death, how fitting it is!

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises. Being and non-being give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low fill each other; sound and voice harmonize each other; front and back follow each other. These are the eternal knowables of all under heaven. Therefore, the sage abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words. [It is not that he does not allow all under heaven to know, but rather that he follows what cannot be known.] The ten thousand things arise yet he does not initiate; they live yet he does not possess; he acts yet does not rely; achievements are completed yet he does not dwell. Only because he does not dwell, they do not depart.

**Chapter Two**
Though the changes of all under heaven are myriad, they ultimately return to two ends. These two ends arise from one source—thus, when there is "beauty," there is also "ugliness"; when there is "goodness," there is also "not-goodness." If one clings to the one to encompass the other’s non-unity, then black and white contend, and praise and blame intermingle. The sage’s "embracing of the One" lies in this: when the one and the other become two, he slowly abides in the center. Thus, when that one and this one stand as fortresses, he knows their foundation is without fortress—then sits and gathers them in. The fortress-builder "dwells," while the one who sits and gathers "does not depart." This is called skillful contention.

Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend. Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal. Do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be confused. Therefore, in the sage’s governance, he empties their hearts [using the useless to employ the without], fills their bellies [using the useful to employ the with], weakens their ambitions [entering the ten thousand things with skill], and strengthens their bones [planting them to await]. He constantly ensures the people are without knowledge and without desire. He causes the wise not to dare act. By acting through non-action, there is nothing left ungoverned.

**Chapter Three**
Contention does not necessarily arise from "worthiness"; theft does not necessarily stem from "rare goods"; the heart is not necessarily "confused" by "seeing what is desirable." The ten thousand things lie in clumps, and delusive dreams arise—when my spirit and form cannot balance themselves, then wood grates against wood to generate heat, water clashes with water to produce bubbles. Yet if one governs them with this, their generation never ceases. Thus, the yang fire advances, and the position it has advanced to, now empty, summons yin. The yin tally retreats, and what it has retreated from drifts to encroach upon yang. Is there not always its opposite?

The "empty" returns to the "heart," the "full" returns to the "belly," the "weak" returns to the "ambition," the "strong" returns to the "bones"—these four numbers each have their return and find their joyous land. Then, without my going, governance is achieved. Who is the master that causes their return? And who holds their mandate at what time?

Can this reveal the nature of contention? Those who do not understand take no part in it. Thus, the sage inwardly uses it to purify the self and outwardly to govern the world.

The Dao is empty—*chong* (in ancient texts, *zhong*, the hollow within a vessel)—yet its use is never full. *It does not seek fullness, hence its "or"*—abyssal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts their sharpness, unravels their tangles; harmonizes their radiance, equalizes their dust. *Yang employs sharpness and embodies light; yin employs tangles and embodies dust.* Profound, it seems to endure. I know not whose child it is—it appears before the image of the Lord.

**Chapter Four**
All use tends toward fullness, yet only *"empty and used, it is never full"*! Its operation as a principle emerges from "tangles" and "dust," enters into "sharpness" and "light"; emerges from "sharpness" and "light," enters into "tangles" and "dust." Only the empty can be sharp, can be bright, can be tangled, can be dust—receiving the return of these four yet retaining none. Thus, when fierce qi comes to contend, a cold heart retreats to its place. Though there be a proud son, he cannot betray his ancestor; though there be a grand emperor, he cannot surpass his predecessor. Does it ever covet their sacrificial vessels or compete in their steps? It resembles and mirrors them, taking its name from things that cannot defy it.

Heaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent—he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs. The space between heaven and earth—is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, *only when exhausted does benevolence arise* the more it moves, the more it issues forth. Having issued, it must reach its limit. Much speech hastens exhaustion—benevolence must speak, yet it is better to guard the center.

**Chapter Five**
Wind arises from emptiness; the bellows awaits the drum—each requires the other to function, yet the vessel itself is not the use. Thus, sounds in unison need not respond, and qi in harmony need not seek. Therefore, heaven cannot give birth, earth cannot complete—heaven and earth cannot claim sole mastery, how much less the myriad things? How much less the sage? What is established in them is merely *"empty yet inexhaustible."* The Dao seams through their midst, so that fish may be made to fly and birds to swim—benevolence is insufficient to resemble it. Benevolence is heaven’s qi, earth’s nourishment, the work of finite ends.

The valley spirit does not die—*Lu Jifu says: "Form and formless unite and do not die"*—this is called the mysterious female. *Lu Jifu says: "The body unites with the heart, the heart with qi, qi with spirit, spirit with nothingness—united, it does not die; not dying, it does not arise; not arising, it can give rise to life"*—the gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth. Ceaselessly it endures, its use never strained.

**Chapter Six**

Those who seek to extinguish the *"valley spirit"* in this world are without limit—ascending mountains to hunt it, gazing into abysses to angle for it, entering states to govern it, traversing wilds to cultivate it. Yet the valley spirit cannot be extinguished: it may be hunted, angled, governed, or cultivated, but it does not precede things to claim merit. The heaven and earth of former times perish in the present; the heaven and earth of today arise from the former. Flowing ceaselessly, they pass one to the other—life thus knows no end, and this is called the root. Grasping the root kills the root; following the root preserves the root. *"Ceaselessly"*—how it clings! *"Never strained"*—how it seems abandoned! Those who follow the root to employ its benefits open the *"gate of the mysterious female"*!

Heaven endures, earth persists. That heaven and earth can endure and persist is because they do not live for themselves, do not give life to themselves—thus they attain long life. Things grow together with them, so the sage places himself last and finds himself first; sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is selfless? Therefore he fulfills his self. **Chapter Seven**

When the fetus grows strong, the mother becomes weak; when the grain ripens, the stalk is harvested—few doubt that heaven and earth too grow weak and are harvested. Yet heaven and earth cannot but feed upon the myriad things, though they never feed for the sake of feeding. Each embryo has its origin, each root its bud; they roam within the void, yet ultimately draw sustenance from what is their own.

The sage does not expose himself to peril—thus he comes last; does not place himself at the center—thus he remains outside. He feeds upon the myriad things yet shows no favor; is fed upon by the myriad things, yet they bear no resentment. Thus, without exerting effort, his merit seeps into the barren soil; without awaiting the ear, his virtue spreads through the generations. And so he matches the enduring constancy of heaven and earth.

**Highest virtue resembles water.**
Water benefits the myriad things yet contends with none, dwelling where the multitude shun—*for men prefer the high and disdain the low*—thus it comes near the Dao.
It abides in good earth, its heart in deep stillness; it befriends with true kindness, speaks with trustworthiness, governs with good order, acts with skill, moves in timely accord. *Not clinging to its goodness, it is truly good.* Only by not contending does it remain free from blame.

**Chapter Eight**

The five phases in their essence—water is the most subtle. Those who dwell well in the Dao value its subtlety, not its conspicuousness; they stay behind the multitude yet always precede them. Why? While others shun what is low, they arrive early without notice. Calculating in reverse, they gather slowly through non-contention—what loss is there for others to dispute? And what blame could fall upon them? If the multitude could recognize the goodness in what they despise, they too would rush to claim it. Yet human nature ensures this never comes to pass, so the sage monopolizes the advantage.

Hold and fill it—*hold it to make it full*—better to desist. Temper and sharpen it—*temper it to make it keen*—it cannot long endure. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them; *rightly, one guards them by not guarding.* Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall. To withdraw once merit is achieved—this is the Dao of heaven.

**Chapter Nine**

**Chapter Ten**

Is not the valley alone adept at fullness? Is not water alone adept at keenness? Abiding in the vessel yet holding nothing—flowing with the current yet never forcing. Thus, as it fills, it empties; as it sharpens, it dulls. Were it otherwise, taking heaven as fulfillment, life would never cease; taking heaven as withdrawal, qi would never recede—how could this be trusted?

Thus, Fan Li’s disappearance as Tao Zhugong followed its trace; Guo Ziyi’s obscurity grasped its mechanism; Xu You and Zhi Fu’s departure embodied its spirit. The trace takes advance as advance, retreat as retreat. The mechanism, even as it advances, retreats; even as it retreats, advances. Is this not the spirit?—achieving without achievement, fulfilling without fulfillment.

Yet even in its retreating trace, the spirit does not forget the Dao, nor does its encounter descend into mechanism.

Carry the po—*the po is the hun; to carry is for the po to bear*—and embrace the One—*the Three and Five as One*—can you remain undivided? Concentrate qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant? Purify the mysterious mirror—can you be without blemish? Loving the state and governing the people—can you act without action? The Gate of Heaven opens and closes—*the source from which life emerges is the Gate of Heaven*—can you remain feminine?—*only when transformation is complete does it receive.* Illuminating the four directions—can you be without knowledge?

**Chapter Ten**
*To carry is to be two with what is carried, thus divided. To concentrate and attain is no longer to be an infant. To purify and remove is already to have blemish. To love and govern is to act. To close and open is to lose half of the feminine. Illumination within, extension to the four directions—this is knowledge. This is the Dao of no constancy, yet leaning upon it for its name, both sides remain without suspicion—this is the perfection of wondrous virtue.*

**Chapter Eleven**

Thirty spokes converge upon a single hub—where its emptiness lies, *the hollow at the hub’s core*, there is the use of the cart. Clay is shaped to form a vessel—where its emptiness lies, *the hollow at the vessel’s center*, there is the use of the vessel. Doors and windows are cut to make a chamber—where its emptiness lies, *the hollow of the door and window openings*, there is the use of the chamber. Thus, what is present is taken for its benefit, while what is absent is taken for its use.

*Wu Youqing says: Qi sustains the body, yet things give rise to qi.*

What is created seeks to possess. Who knows that in seeking to possess, one preserves the void? Striving for presence, yet serving only absence—is this delight in emptiness? No, the void is where use is stored. Things stand before me, yet I cannot grasp them. Forms and numbers stand before the Dao, yet the Dao does not reside in them to obstruct itself.

Yin congeals and yang melts to form humanity, while the primal qi abides between them—encountered by those who rely neither on fire nor on talismans. Benevolence and righteousness, firmness and softness, become teachings, while the great uncarved block abides between them—encountered by those who rely neither on nature nor on emotion. Victory and defeat, gain and loss, become transformations, while the convergence of events abides between them—encountered by those who rely neither on order nor on chaos.

Thus, avoid what is hard, strike at its flaws, discard its name, and seek its reality. Wait but a moment, and the ten thousand mechanisms unite in one.

The five colors blind the eyes;

Five tones deafen the ears;
Five flavors dull the palate;
Racing and hunting madden the heart;
Rare goods corrupt conduct.
Thus the sage attends to the belly, not to the eyes—hence discarding that and embracing this.

**Chapter Twelve**
The eye takes mechanism as its mechanism,
while the belly takes non-mechanism as its mechanism.
Mechanism responds to mechanism,
but non-mechanism is what mechanism seeks to contain.
Between eye and belly lies the heart.
Only by withdrawing the heart to the belly can one observe things.
Thus turbidity must not be given a mind,
nor clarity be given traces.
Do not use ritual to curb desire,
nor knowledge to discern intent—
await things’ self-collapse, and Heaven will be effortlessly released.

**Chapter Thirteen**
Favor and disgrace are like alarm;
value great trouble as you do your own body.
What does “favor and disgrace are like alarm” mean?
Favor is inferior—
disgrace arrives and one is alarmed, but when it departs, one is at ease.
Yet favor arrives and one is alarmed, and when it departs, one is alarmed again—
thus it is even worse.
To gain it is alarming, to lose it is alarming—
this is called “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”
What does “value great trouble as you do your own body” mean?
The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.
If I had no body, what trouble would I have?
Thus one who values the body as the world may be entrusted with the world;
one who cherishes the body as the world may be charged with the world.

**Chapter Thirteen (continued)**
The multitude internalize the world within the body,
while the perfected person externalizes the body to the world.
For one who does not internalize the world—
can there be inevitable worries?
Favor arrives like alarm, disgrace comes like alarm—
this is internalizing the world by internalizing alarm to disturb oneself.
Great trouble lies in the world,
yet to internalize and value it as equal to the body—
when the body itself is trouble,
to value trouble as a heavy burden upon the body
is to internalize trouble to shackle oneself.
Only one without a body:
lets the ear be the ear, not bearing the world’s hearing;
lets the eye be the eye, not bearing the world’s seeing.
My ears and eyes are still,
and the world’s seeing and hearing do not dazzle.
Alarm and trouble depart from oneself
and dissolve into the world—
thus one treads upon the people’s path without stumbling.

Look and it cannot be seen—call it the Subtle;
listen and it cannot be heard—call it the Rare;
grasp and it cannot be held—call it the Minute.
These three cannot be exhaustively questioned—
thus they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright;
below, it is not obscure.
Unceasing, yet unnameable—
it alternates between being and non-being, with no beginning or end.
To name it as being is to lose non-being;
to name it as non-being is to lose being.
Endlessly continuous, it cannot be named—
it returns to nothingness.
This is called the formless form,
the imageless image—
this is called the Indistinct and Vague.
Meet it and you do not see its head;
follow it and you do not see its rear.
Hold to the ancient Dao to steer the present being.
The ancient is also the beginning,
the present is also being.
Empty the

Those who do not perceive its intervals
attempt to unite or oppose it—
thus all things become afflictions.
The Dao has no intervals,
yet people forcibly divide them;
thus they grasp and distinguish it—
and the Dao becomes mere name.
Riding the interval-less upon the intervalled,
one roams all day,
and affliction and name depart.
When affliction and name depart,
this is "nothingness."
As for things that exist:
some are light, some heavy;
some radiant, some dust-like;
some act, some rest—
this is called "lack of principle."
One name is yin, another yang—
yet the harmonizing qi perishes.
One name is benevolence, another righteousness—
yet the Great Harmony perishes.
The Dao is born before yin and yang,
yet dies in benevolence and righteousness!
Thus,
Li Zhu could not discern the meeting of black and white,
Shi Kuang could not fathom the convergence of gong and shang,
Qing Ji could not seize the gap in empty dust,
and the divine Yu could not clarify the division of heaven and earth.
Who but one of utmost constancy could partake in this?

The ancients who were skilled in the Dao
were subtly mysterious and profoundly penetrating,
too deep to be known.
Precisely because they could not be known,
one can only forcibly describe them:
hesitant, as if fording a river in winter;
cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;
solemn, as if a guest;
dispersing, as if ice melting;
thick, as if uncarved wood;
vast, as if a valley;
turbid, as if muddy;
placid, as if the sea;
driftless, as if without end.
Who can gradually clarify the turbid through stillness?
Who can gradually quicken the tranquil through movement?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Only by not being full
can one remain concealed and not newly completed.

Those who choose the wondrous are many,
yet few trace subtlety to its source.
Those who seek penetration are numerous,
yet rare are those who take mystery as penetration.
Just as ceremonial caps are unsuited to Yue,
if I have no intention of entering Yue,
then wonder lies not in whether one wears a cap or not—
how dare I test it on my body?
How dare I test its absence on my head?
How could I know that those who dare not test it
do not find Yue suited to me?
Sitting and dissolving it,
ice may be warmed,
the turbid may be clarified—
one may walk in rain without an umbrella,
go hungry without provisions.
In gradual waiting,
is there truly a Yellow River that cannot be stilled,
a horse’s horn that cannot grow?
The world is already thus,
yet those who vie for fame take blunted sharpness as achievement.
Long have they abandoned the old and delighted in the new,
yet cannot bring anything to completion!

To reach utmost emptiness,
[The *Kaiyuan Commentary* states: "To reach" means to ensure it comes of itself, as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*' "to summon the army."]
guard stillness with sincerity.
The ten thousand things arise together,
and I thereby observe their return.
Things flourish in abundance,
each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness,
[not that I still it—]
stillness is called regaining life’s mandate.
Regaining life’s mandate is called constancy,
[which cannot again be altered.]
To know constancy is called illumination.
Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.
Knowing constancy, one embraces all,
[the myriad changes may be contained.]
Embracing all, one is impartial,
[not hoarding goodness for oneself.]
Impartiality is wholeness,
[receiving all things that come.]
Wholeness is Heaven,
Heaven is the Dao,
the Dao is enduring—
throughout life, one encounters no peril.

Chapter Sixteen
[The lowest strike at the solid,
the next seek the hollow.
The lowest seize movement,
the next cling to stillness.
Between two solids,
emptiness thus arises naturally;
at the extremity of all movement,
stillness originally returns of itself.
Neither seeking nor clinging,
one attains the utmost, the sincere.
How to clarify this?
The ten thousand things arise together,
and in their flourishing,
their momentum exhausted, they return to whence they came.
Thus, the leaves of Deng Forest
may be counted without tally;
the rain of a thousand *li*
may be measured without vessel.
Yet abandoning this to act—
can it not be called reckless?
Therefore, with nothing to possess or contrive,
the world is at my disposal—
its Dao does not rely on action but on observation.
Observation is the eye.
To observe without acting,
the eye becomes the belly.]

The highest,
unaware of their existence;

The next rank,
cherishes and praises them;
the next,
fears them;
the next,
scorns them.
Where trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.
How measured, how precious his words!

[When one lacks self-trust,
one cannot trust the natural order of the world.
And not knowing restraint yet still speaking,
this invites scorn.]

When merit is achieved and affairs completed,
the hundred clans all say, "We are naturally thus."

**Chapter Seventeen**
[Relying on the Dao in this,
one doubts that as the Dao;
relying on the Dao in that,
one doubts this is not the Dao.
Having first differentiated,
then sought commonality,
the Dao is confounded in duality,
and afflicted in unity.
Both confounded and afflicted,
doubt does not depart.
Having already taken doubt as one’s own,
thus the true king, seeing no intimacy, grieves;
the hegemon, encountering no fear, trembles.
With doubt unresolved,
he resorts to binding words—
thus beginning with oaths and covenants,
and ending in armor and helmets.

Yet he who makes others forget him in spontaneity—
could his heart not be spontaneous?
Trusting that the world cannot transgress this,
he allows its flow to shift without departing from its source,
without erring in its return.
Empty and unburdened above the world,
he awaits the self-completion of things.

Thus, the world’s nature
cannot be forced, cannot be altered.
The governance of the highest,
neither obstructs nor facilitates,
like an elder’s guidance,
like exhausting another’s strength—
and people, idle and at ease, call it spontaneity.]

When the great Dao declines,
there is benevolence and righteousness.

When wisdom emerges, great deceit arises;
when the six relations fall out of harmony, filial piety and kindness appear;
when the state is benighted and disordered, loyal ministers emerge.

Sever sagacity, discard wisdom—
the people benefit a hundredfold;
sever benevolence, discard righteousness—
the people return to filial piety and kindness;
sever skill, discard profit—
thieves and bandits vanish.
Yet these three, made into ornament, are not sufficient.

Thus let there be that to which one belongs:
manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
reduce thought, diminish desire,
cut off learning, and be without care.

"Unceasing, as if existing"—
could this be that to which one belongs?

Thus the fish swims and water bears it; the bird flies and emptiness upholds it.
Of all that contains the world’s ornament, none is greater than plainness;
of all that supplies the world’s insufficiency, none is greater than simplicity.
To regard it as existent is yet far from intimate with its use;
to regard it as nonexistent is where human and Heaven’s mutual intimacy lies.
Linked to harmony to bring forth life—
thus one attains long life.
Severed from harmony to employ it exclusively—
thus it has no great use.

"Yea" and "ah," how far apart are they?
Beauty and ugliness, how distant are they?
What men fear cannot but be feared.
Vast and boundless—how it has not yet reached its end!

The multitude bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on the grand sacrifice,
as if ascending the terrace in spring.
I alone remain still,
without sign or omen,
dim and murky, like an infant yet to smile,
weary and forlorn, as if with no place to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
while I alone seem to have lost everything.
What a fool’s heart I possess!
The common folk are bright and clear,
while I alone am dull and obscure.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
while I alone am muddled and confused.
The multitude all have their uses,
while I alone am stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
and value feeding from the Mother.

Virtue’s power takes form only by following the Dao.
As a thing, the Dao is only vague and indistinct.
Indistinct and vague,
yet within it are images;
vague and indistinct,
yet within it are things.
Dark and obscure,
yet within it is essence;
its essence is most real,
within it is trustworthiness.
From present back to ancient times,
its name has never departed,
by which we observe the origins of the multitude.
How do I know the forms of the multitude’s origins?
By this.

The two pair and give rise to the "Mean."
"Vague and indistinct" have no pair,
without pair there is no "Mean."
How then can one know that between the paired,
it is neither left nor right,
and thus cannot be called the "Mean"?
The "Mean" enters into pairing yet embraces the paired.
Though there be hardened metal,
it may be forged and melted;
though there be piled earth,
it may be washed away and leveled.
Thus metal and earth cannot preserve their nature.
Though there be hot springs,
there are also cold fires;
thus water and fire cannot maintain their true essence.
What is it that is harder than metal without sharpening,
denser than earth without thickness,
hotter than fire without warmth,
colder than water without moisture?
It observes change yet does not shift,
knows what is so yet does not proceed.
Thus nothing is more real than the insubstantial,
nothing more trustworthy than the unreturning,
no name more enduring than that which does not alter between this and that,
and no form more perfect than that which does not differ from the myriad in even one part.
Seizing Heaven’s mechanism,
discarding semblances of the Dao—
only then may it be named "Vast Virtue."

To bend is to be whole,
to twist is to be straight,
to hollow is to be filled,
to wear out is to be renewed,
to have little is to gain,
to have much is to be confused.
Thus the sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven.
Not seeing oneself, one is thus illuminated;
not asserting oneself, one is thus distinguished.

Not self-boasting, thus possessing merit;
not self-aggrandizing, thus enduring.
Only through non-contention
does none under Heaven contend with it.
The ancient saying "To bend is to be whole"—
how could it be empty words?
Truly whole, it returns to wholeness.

Chapter Twenty-Two

The teachings of things involve coming and going.
To meet what comes is not as good as to await what goes;
to chase what goes is not as good as to await what comes.
Yet those who daily scrutinize coming and going with the mind
are neither ahead of the time nor in time with it.
Preceding, they lose what follows;
following, they lose what precedes—
toiling endlessly yet gaining nothing.
Thus lesser wisdom daily sees its excess,
while greater wisdom daily sees its insufficiency.
The great Dao abides in the center,
like one who, searching for a lost child or misplaced family treasure,
rushes about in confusion with armored steed,
yet finds nothing all day—
how long has multiplicity been a delusion?

One is called "emptiness," emptiness is called "constancy."
Abiding in constancy, employing emptiness,
nurturing the bent to become whole,
one comprehends the great pattern of coming and going.

Few words accord with nature.

Thus the whirlwind does not last the morning,
nor the sudden rain the whole day.
What brings these about? Heaven and Earth.
If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,
how much less can man?

Therefore those who engage with the Dao become one with the Dao;
those who engage with virtue become one with virtue;
those who engage with loss become one with loss.
Those who become one with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them;
those who become one with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them;
those who become one with loss—loss delights in obtaining them.
Where trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.

Only those who truly know the Dao see all as naturally trustworthy.

When Heaven and Earth violate their harmony,
they may act as heaven, act as earth,
yet cannot endure.
When man violates his harmony,
he may gain, he may lose,
yet cannot unite.
Flowing with yang, he is stifled by yin;
flowing with yin, he is stifled by yang.
Words in excess stumble; joy at its peak turns to sorrow.
The mind shifts a hundred times, startling even in sleep.
Not knowing the vastness of unity, he disbelieves much,
sitting and losing the constant Dao—
how can he hope for spontaneity?

All Dao is Dao, all virtue is virtue, all loss is loss.
Dao and virtue delight in roaming with the like—
how could they change even after long ages?
Without reaching extremes of joy or anger,
what fault lies in wind or rain?

Those who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm;
those who stride do not walk far.
Those who display themselves are not enlightened;
those who assert themselves are not distinguished;
those who boast of their deeds achieve no merit;
those who are proud do not endure.

In the Way, these are called:
excess like leftover food, growths like tumors.
Beings may loathe them—
thus those who possess the Way do not dwell in them.

---

Those whose minds grow ever more frantic lose ever more of the trigger;
those who cling ever more rigidly err ever more grievously.
When the prior trigger has passed,
to chase and attach to it
is like eating one’s fill and then setting out more.
When the later trigger has not yet come,
to force and bind to it
is like a body already formed and then adding extra limbs.
The calculations of the Way are inexhaustible—
to grasp partiality or excess in order to exhaust them
is surely to incur the hatred of beings
and to harm oneself.

---

There is a thing, formless yet complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent, empty,
it stands alone and does not change,
it moves in cycles and does not weary—
it may be called the Mother of heaven and earth.

I do not know its name—
forced to designate it, I call it *Dao*;
forced to name it, I call it *Great*.
Great means passing,
passing means far-reaching,
far-reaching means returning.

Thus the Dao is great,
heaven is great,
earth is great,
and man is also great.
Within the realm there are four greats,
and man occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
earth models itself on heaven,
heaven models itself on the Dao,
and the Dao models itself on spontaneity.

---

Forms and images have gaps;
the Dao has no gaps.
The Dao does not choose being,
nor does it choose non-being—
it goes along with them all.
Going without ceasing in its going,
thus it is called passing, far-reaching.
Abiding without contradicting its coming,
going along with them all in their coming,
then the passing and far-reaching immediately return.
Since the Dao is already thus,
those who model themselves on the Dao
also ride along with it in its going and coming.
And those who ride along with it in its going and coming,
by maintaining constancy, the world naturally reverts—
how could they worry that their measures will be insufficient?

“Bearing the *po* and embracing the One without parting”—
this is how it is used.
Taken from near at hand, the body,
it is like the stillness of the back, not the mechanism of the eyes.
Taken from afar, heaven and earth,
it is like great governance, not carving and dividing.
Thus it can serve as the king of the world.

Weight is the root of lightness, stillness the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the noble person travels all day without parting from their heavy provisions.
Though there be splendid sights, they dwell in leisurely detachment.
How could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his own person as light before the world?
Lightness loses its root, restlessness loses its ruler.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**

Where there is root, there is stem; where there is ruler, there is minister.
Yet is it not better to guard the root?
In a single breath’s span, the myriad movements contend,
yet cannot but come to rest.
The Dao does not stagnate in what comes to rest,
but through what comes to rest, observation is made—
then the Dao’s roaming in emptiness,
its ceaseless continuity, becomes visible.
If one cannot endure even for a moment,
but proceeds lightly,
then responses lie in one while contradictions lie in ten thousand;
grace resides in one corner while resentment fills the other three.
Thus the world is handed the handle,
and one’s own person is instead controlled.
Hence the Xia perished through the construction of the Mulberry Palace,
and the Zhou declined through the boats for Han conquest.
To rescue the world with benevolence is to drown it;
to save the world with righteousness is to sink it.
The world’s vastness may be swept away in an instant—
how much more the harmony within one’s own body?

Good conduct leaves no wheel tracks, good speech no flaws.

Good conduct does not tread upon solid ground, good speech does not cling to beauty. Good calculation requires no counting rods; counting rods achieve the small but forget the great. Good closure needs no bolt nor bar yet cannot be opened—Lu Jifu says: "If I do not open, who can open it?" Good binding needs no cord nor knot yet cannot be undone—no attachment, no separation, like a mother to her child.

Thus the sage is ever good at saving people, and so discards no one; ever good at saving things, and so discards nothing. This is called inheriting clarity.

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good; the not-good person is the resource of the good. If one does not value one’s teacher nor cherish one’s resource, though wise, one is greatly deluded. This is called the essential mystery.

Chapter Twenty-Seven
My possession of clarity is not clarity—how much less to cast clarity upon things and measure their lengths and shorts to make them shine? Thus birds are trapped by fullness, earthworms confined by emptiness, fish stranded on dry land—each secures its capture yet does not know that what seems not to be gained can be gain. If I wish to overcome them, I do not go forth to measure them.

All things adorn their forms to seek one another, or flee their beauty to provoke one another; all secretly probe their roots, conceal and possess them—then things come to me, and I do not go to things. The many full seek supply, but the one empty has no gaps. Thus the intentions of good and evil vanish, and what speech and conduct enclose and bind is an essential mystery beyond fathoming.

Know the masculine, keep to the feminine—Lu Jifu says: "Harmonious yet not leading"—become the world’s stream. As the world’s stream, constant virtue does not depart, returning to infancy. Know the white, keep to the black, become the world’s model. As the world’s model, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless. Know glory, keep to disgrace, become the world’s valley. As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to uncarved simplicity.

When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; the sage employs it and becomes the chief of officials—using what has not yet scattered. Thus great wisdom does not sever.

Chapter Twenty-Eight
Whether feminine or masculine, white or black, glory or disgrace, each has its counterpart and cannot intermingle. Then my Dao is nearly exhausted, and my knowing and keeping are no longer one. The knowing return to clarity, the keeping return to turbidity; the two arts divide, each returning to its likeness. One who roams the circle’s center may know this.

Yet if one devotes intent to knowing but achieves success through keeping, why is this? The guest is clarity, the host is turbidity—by the necessity of things reaching their extreme and turning back, what turns back can long be the host. Thus infancy can mature, but maturity cannot return to infancy; the boundless can become bounded, but the bounded cannot become boundless; simplicity can be carved, but carving cannot return to simplicity.

Yet the sage does not meticulously distinguish between what can and cannot be. Roaming the circle’s center, like a soaking rain upon an anthill, like a prairie fire scorching a thicket—without beginning or end, most solid and most empty—establishing order so that clarity and turbidity each return to their abodes, resplendently enacting great regulation.

Though compelled to seek its use, then the feminine, the black, the disgraceful—grasp their power to age the world’s vessels.

Chapter Twenty-Nine
Those who would take the world and act upon it, I see they do not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel—though it is a vessel, the sacred constantly flows through it—it cannot be acted upon, cannot be grasped. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.

Thus the sage practices non-action, and so does not ruin; does not grasp, and so does not lose. For things sometimes lead, sometimes follow; sometimes exhale, sometimes inhale; sometimes are strong, sometimes weak; sometimes are upheld, sometimes overthrown. All is as the sacred makes it so.

Therefore the sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes excessiveness.

The world is within me—what do I take? I am within the world—what do I do? The world is like me—what do I desire? I am like the world—what do I grasp? Measuring the world by myself, the world is sacred. Encountering myself with the world, the world is not sacred. Those who are not sacred make it sacred, and the world is disordered. Those who are sacred make it not sacred, and I am at peace.

Thus exhausting the world with the eight reckonings and removing my three deaths, then raging fire may burn the forest yet one can await its cold, vast floods may drown the heavens yet one can watch them dry. Water and fire lose their power, metal and stone forsake their steadfastness—how much more those with feelings who must be exhausted and those with qi who must contract?

One who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use arms to strengthen the world.

The matter favors remoteness. Where the army dwells, brambles grow. In the wake of great armies, lean years must follow. Goodness achieves its end and no more—it does not seize strength. Having achieved, do not boast; having achieved, do not vaunt; having achieved, do not grow arrogant. Achievement comes only when there is no other choice; having achieved, do not force it. Even in times when arms must be used, when calamity arises and victory is certain, one should still hold these five principles in mind.

When things reach their prime, they age—this is called not following the Dao. What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

[Chapter 30]
Those who employ arms at the lowest level do so to kill; at the highest, to preserve life. Yet even those who use life to sustain life are superfluous—how much more those who use killing to sustain life? People are never without life—why then should I urge them? Moreover, the gate of merit is the mansion of harm. People are never without life, yet one cannot rely on their living; things are never without death, yet one cannot depend on their dying. A moment’s failure of restraint, and one calls oneself resolute—is this not delusion?

Thus, those who are skilled at restraining violence wait for its dissipation rather than crushing its breath; those who are skilled at governing the passions block their growth rather than forcing their decline; those who value life hold to the balance between growth and decline, without trespassing against their critical juncture. Even in adversity, they do not perish early.

The weapon of war is an inauspicious instrument—some beings detest it, and thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell with it. The noble person at rest values the left, but in warfare values the right. War is an inauspicious instrument, not the instrument of the noble person; when compelled to use it, one should do so with utmost restraint. To triumph is not to be celebrated; those who celebrate it delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their will in the world.

Auspicious affairs honor the left, while inauspicious affairs honor the right. The deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right—this is to treat war as a funeral rite. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with funeral rites.

**Chapter Thirty-One**
Better to forget it beforehand than to lament it afterward; better to dwell in the realm of no merit through auspicious means than to claim merit through inauspicious rites. Those who cannot seize the initiative, cannot choose the auspicious, cannot exploit opportunities with abundance—such are they of whom it is said, *"How could they comprehend the meaning of ritual?"*

The Dao is eternally nameless—*Wang Fusi says: "The Dao is formless and unbound, eternally beyond naming"*—though its uncarved simplicity is small, none in the world can subjugate it. If lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will naturally submit. Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew, and the people, without command, distribute it evenly.

Once systems create names, and names are established, one must also know when to stop; knowing when to stop ensures one does not fall into peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams in relation to rivers and seas.

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
Valleys and streams form rivers and seas, but rivers and seas cannot revert to valleys and streams. The Dao disperses to become the world, but the world cannot revert to the Dao.

Those who rely on the Great Beginning remain nameless; those who halt at what is already so acquire names. Yet if, having acquired names, one can still halt, then the former name is fulfilled while the latter name does not arise. Beyond this, one may yet return to the Great Beginning. Heaven and earth are substantial; sweet dew is subtle. Rising from the earth, the earth claims no merit; descending from heaven, heaven does not perpetually possess it. This is the natural course after halting—without command, it distributes itself evenly. The subtlety of post-heaven aligns with pre-heaven; how much more so for that which has never begun to halt?

To know others is wisdom; to know oneself is clarity.

The one who overcomes others is mighty; the one who overcomes oneself is strong. The one who knows contentment is rich. The one who acts with perseverance has resolve. The one who does not lose their place endures. The one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.

[Wealth does not necessarily entail resolve, and resolve cannot be equated with wealth. Endurance has its limits, but longevity knows no end.]

To use qi to supplement qi, essence to supplement essence, and claim "I do not lose my place"—yet in the end, all return to decay. How is this different from Shan Bao, who perished externally, or Zhang Yi, who perished internally? For those who scheme with cunning and exert force to pursue their ambitions, clinging to a "place" yet unable to follow the natural "place" of no loss—such is their fate. To see that one’s essence and qi are not in excess may be called death, yet that which remains within—gentle as a maiden, flowing like clouds, subtle and mysteriously penetrating—has never perished. Without truly employing this subtle clarity, bending and stretching within the ultimate harmony of the Dao, as if embracing it without parting, how could one partake in this?

Thus, the laws of Youyu endured, but the Way of Tai Shi was long-lived. The calculations of mediocre scholars may stretch long, but the life of those who embody the Dao knows no bounds. These words record the achievements of the Profound Mystery.

The Great Dao flows everywhere, to left and right alike. The myriad things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse; its work is accomplished, yet it does not claim possession. It clothes and nourishes the myriad things yet does not act as their master—it may be called small. The myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—it may be called great. Because it never asserts its own greatness, [it may be named yet does not act—this is why it never acts as such] it accomplishes its greatness.

Who can claim to repay heaven and earth with life, only to resent them in death? Heaven and earth engage with things in constant exchange, merely prolonging their own existence. If even heaven and earth are thus, how much more so the Dao? Vast and boundless, without borders; flowing and interconnected, with means to communicate. Thus, east and west have no fixed direction, achievements and fame bear no attachment, host and guest have no fixed roles, one’s own life is valued yet the lives of things are not opposed. Truly, if one does not perceive what is desirable, it is not because desire is blocked; if one alternates in the role of master, it is not because one refuses mastery. How could those who hastily seek to establish their greatness ever comprehend this?

Hold to the Great Image, and all under heaven will come to you.

Those who come to you do no harm—though they forget one another in the arts of the Dao, they never truly part—thus attaining peace and great tranquility.

Music and delicacies entice the passing traveler to stay.
The Dao that issues from the mouth is so bland it seems flavorless,
seen yet not worthy of sight,
heard yet not worthy of hearing,
yet its use cannot be exhausted.

The thirty-fifth chapter:
The snake’s control lies in its neck; man’s control lies in his waist.
Bind its neck, and its sting is rendered useless;
"restrain the waist," and "the spine unfolds."
The image is subtle, yet its control is vast.

Thus, the clear and empty are the convergence of things,
while the heavy and turbid are their regulators.
Do not abandon the regulator, nor flee the convergence;
from emptiness gain fullness, from fullness gain emptiness.
Grasp the heavy and turbid to attain the clear and empty.

Try reflecting on this: when music plays and delicacies are prepared,
even the traveler hastening on his way finds his wandering heart stilled—
is this not a return to feeling?
This is what is meant by "constantly having desire to observe its manifestations."

Yet the neck and the waist are without feeling.
What is without feeling cannot be forced to accept what has feeling as its master.
Thus, in its profound subtlety and boundless use,
this is the ultimate of desirelessness.

Beginning with the heavy and turbid, returning to the clear and empty;
having attained the clear and empty, following the heavy and turbid;
whether with desire or without, the constant remains unchanged—
this is what those who hold to the Great Image alone attain!

When you wish to contract it, you must first expand it;
when you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it;
when you wish to abolish it, you must first promote it;
when you wish to seize it, you must first give it.
(What is firm is inwardly and outwardly steadfast, unchanged from beginning to end.)
This is called "subtle clarity."
(As Wang Yuanzhe said: "Even ghosts and spirits in their hidden depths cannot fathom it—how much less can men?")

The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
Fish must not leave the depths;
the state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.

Li Xizhai said: This is the way of the sage in mastering the heart and seizing the passions—Chapter Thirty-Six.
(To contain the Dao is to find one’s own ease;
to embrace the Dao is to preserve one’s own existence—
is this not like fish finding their own fulfillment in the depths?
Those who rely on names and reputations fear only that they will not be shown to others,
and so the Dao stagnates, and the world probes its limits.
Without gates, without poisons, all things look to me for this alone.
If I do not respond to them with this, then the world will have no way to reach me.
Having no way to reach me, where in the world can it go?
Thus the world dies to the Dao and encounters eternal life in the world—
this is the use of this instrument.)

The Dao is constantly without action, yet there is nothing it does not do.
If lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will transform themselves.
When transformation stirs desire, I will suppress it with the nameless uncarved block.
Suppressing it with the nameless uncarved block, desire will cease.
With desire stilled, the world will right itself.
(What transforms returns to the manifest;
what is right returns to the wondrous.)

Chapter Thirty-Seven:
(Those who conceal the uncarved block have the use of instruments for all time;
those who display the uncarved block find their use limited to instruments alone.
Thus the nameless and the named are companions, yet they cannot be without it.
Fearing its use and making the named its companion, they therefore cast aside desire.
Those who defend the state by fortifying the city do not seek the merit of repelling invaders;
those who guard the self by closing the gate do not resist the allure of external things.
Knowing the root of things to be right, they dare not set them right through transformation.
In their practice of the Dao, when measured by the profound mystery, it seems shallow;
when opened through the wondrous gate, it seems deep.
Deeming it useless, its use is manifest;
deeming it useful, its uselessness is manifest.
All day long it disperses yet is never empty;
in the faintest breath it communicates, wriggling as if it exists.
Two ramparts stand, and it guards well the space between;
two extremes race, and it awaits well their return—
then what need is there to speak of the uncarved block, and how can the profound exhaust it?)

Highest virtue does not act as virtue, and so possesses virtue;
lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and so lacks virtue.
Highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose;
lesser virtue acts with purpose.
(Acting in non-being is called acting without purpose;
acting in being is called acting with purpose.)
Highest benevolence acts without purpose;
highest righteousness acts with purpose.
Highest propriety acts, and when none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and forces them.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
when virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
when righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of disorder.
Foreknowledge—
(its clarity is not within, but arises from grasping prior conditions—
this is called foreknowledge)
—is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly.
Therefore the great man dwells in the substantial, not in the superficial;
(what is sharp and swiftly gains fame is superficial;
what retreats and nurtures the root is substantial.)
he dwells in the real, not in the flowery.
Thus he discards that and takes this.

Chapter Thirty-Eight.

The conduct of tigers and leopards—
advancing forward, they cannot look back.
Newly planted trees—
when their blossoms flourish, their roots cannot take firm hold.
Yet one cannot remain without advancing;
if there must be advance, let it be with simplicity at the fore!
Those who advance confront danger;
those who retreat observe change.
Those who confront danger are steadfast and unshaken;
those who observe change adapt to circumstances with measured discernment.
Thus, one does not wield the sharpness of knowledge to assail the world’s perilous clefts.
Why?
Because to lose the master is to delight in seizing fine reputations and clinging to them,
turning away from the encompassing beauty of the multitude—
these are virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety,
which can be named but do not endure.
Thus, to go forth is to exceed in floridity,
to return is to exceed in superficiality.
Only by first restraining those who advance
can one attain virtue without claiming virtue,
and act without contrivance.

Yan Junping said:
*"The utmost arrives, yet oneness does not remain."*
Does it not remain?
Truly, there is no means by which to retain it.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
spirits attained the One and became numinous;
valleys attained the One and became full;
*(valleys are empty yet receive the myriad things, hence they are called "full")*
the myriad things attained the One and came to life;
kings and lords attained the One and became the norm for all under heaven.
In their attainment, it is said:
Were heaven not clear, it would fear rending;
were earth not tranquil, it would fear crumbling;
were spirits not numinous, they would fear fading;
were valleys not full, they would fear exhaustion;
were the myriad things not alive, they would fear annihilation;
were kings and lords not the norm, they would fear downfall.
Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root,
the high takes the low as its foundation.
Therefore, kings and lords refer to themselves as "the orphaned," "the widowed," "the unworthy."
Is this not taking the humble as their root?
Is it not so?
Thus, to amass many carriages is to have no carriage.
Therefore, one does not desire to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.

Li Xizhai said:
*"Wheels, canopies, spokes, and axles—
assembled, they become a carriage,
yet each part has its name, while the carriage itself cannot be named.
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—
united, they form the Dao,
yet benevolence and righteousness can be named, while the Dao cannot.
If there is something to grasp, allowing its traces to appear externally,
the noble becomes like jade, the base like stone—
once they can be pointed out and named, people begin to distinguish noble from base."*

The foolish cling to the "One" yet cannot "employ" it;
the wise daily "employ" it yet cannot "unite" with it.
To "employ" is to lose the "One";
not to "unite" is to lack "employment."
The "One" embraces the myriad things,
entering them without opposing them.
"Employment" is without affairs,
engaging with affairs without clinging to them.
How much less can it be sought or grasped?
Thus, when wine ferments, buyers arrive;
when a lodging is repaired, travelers rest.
I do not "attain the One" but provisionally guard its turbidity,
using it as a bellows and basket,
and only then can the "One" be "attained" without refusal.
For the noble and base, high and low, are equal in relation to the "One"—
how can there be a fitting match?
Yet the noble and high are the storehouses of merit and fame,
while the base and low have no accomplishment.
Merit is established without mutual inclusion,
fame is fixed without mutual communication—
then even the myriad things are not exhausted,
how much less the "One"?
Thus, the principle of heaven and earth is impaired,
and the way of kings and lords is lost.
Those who use the great "carriage" to bear all under heaven
have long known what to take and what to discard.

Reversion is the movement of the Dao.

Movement both departing and arriving—this is called reversion. The qi-mechanism of transformation in things, all possessing departure and arrival, originates in the Dao’s flowing vastness, its ceaseless shifting, exhalation and inhalation, its subtlety in non-stasis.

Weakness is the function of the Dao. Firmness and strength rely on support and thus lose their function—this is not the Dao. The function of the Dao lies solely in movement through weakness.

The ten thousand things under heaven are born from Being, and Being is born from Non-being. When the Dao rests in Non-being, is this not reversion? That which ascends—is it not movement? As Zhao Zhijian says: Though things have not yet taken form, their qi already exists. Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things arise from the One Qi, and the One Qi arises from the Dao.

Chapter Forty:
Flowing, it may fill; full, it may halt—then it dies and becomes a vessel. People know the vessel’s utility but do not know it died in becoming a vessel. As for the Dao, it embraces the ten thousand things and enters the ten thousand things, now departing, now arriving, now arriving, now departing, coiling and subtle, never exhausted. When it presses forward and arrives, there is Being; when it draws back and departs, it entrusts itself to Non-being to generate Being, and thus may be named Non-being. Therefore, observing it through its reversion, one may perceive it directly.

Its child is light, its grandchild is water—truly, to embody its function is difficult. To force arrival with strength, to halt departure with weakness, to bring forth function through movement, is to cling to robust existence and obstruct the qi-mechanism of life’s departure and arrival. Thus, function always lies in weakness, and only then can the Dao be employed.

The arising of movement is the work of Heaven. The arising of function is the work of humans. Heaven models itself on the Dao, humans model themselves on Heaven—what place is there for force? Yet those who know the fundamental movement of the Dao’s body are few. Only by knowing movement does one know reversion; by knowing reversion does one know weakness.

The highest scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it. The middling scholar, hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt. The lowest scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs loudly at it. Without such laughter, it would not suffice as the Dao. Thus, established sayings declare:

The luminous Dao seems obscure;
The advancing Dao seems to retreat;
The level Dao seems uneven;
Highest virtue resembles a valley;
Vast virtue seems insufficient;
Established virtue seems lax;
True substance seems to change;
Great purity seems sullied;
Great squares have no corners;
Great vessels take long to complete;
Great sounds are scarcely heard;
Great images have no form.

As Lü Jifu says: Sinking into petty measures, one returns to great penetration.

The Dao conceals itself in namelessness.
[The constant name cannot be named.]

Only the Dao excels at bestowing and accomplishing.
As in Chapter Forty-One:

If there were one skilled in bestowing, others would seek to borrow from him, yet he does not cling to things to grant them. The Dao, too, is thus—yet I have never seen things borrow from the Dao. Why? Things and the Dao form a single body, and things are the Dao itself. Things come and go, live and return, daily drinking from the Dao, yet ultimately never moistened; daily illuminated by the Dao, yet ultimately returning to where there is no light. Without moisture, without illumination—this is the minor accomplishment of things. Without brilliance, without flow—the Dao’s function reaches its utmost. Thus, one may strive yet never apply force; one may act yet never see achievement. The names of "obscurity," "retreating," "disgrace," and "laxity" are not falsely ascribed. Yet those who accept them without refusal—can they not be called the highest scholars?

The Dao gives birth to the One, [the unifying qi harmonizes]. The One gives birth to the Two, [once harmony is achieved, yin and yang emerge. The unifying qi and yin-yang become two]. The Two gives birth to the Three, [yin and yang again divide to become three]. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the unifying qi.

What people despise are "orphan," "widow," and "worthless," yet kings and lords take these as their titles. Thus, some things are diminished yet gain, while others are increased yet lose. What others teach, I also teach. [The supreme Dao is not in words; it is known through resonance.] "The strong and violent do not meet a natural death"—I take this as the father of all teachings.

Forty-Second Chapter
[When it abides in the Dao, containing "Three" within the "One," the fullness of life cannot be fathomed, and its ultimate state is minimal. When it acts as life, it begins with the "unifying qi" and ends with "yin and yang." Once yin and yang are established, the affairs of life multiply, and the principle of life is exhausted. How much more so when, following the inclinations of yin and yang, one pursues purity to greedily grasp heaven and clings to turbidity to stubbornly hold earth, inhaling at dawn and dining at dusk, endlessly filling and pouring to flaunt abundance, while despising all else as insufficient? Then yin dies in turbidity, yang dies in purity—how can one even faintly resemble the so-called "harmony"? How much less attain the harmony that transcends harmony?

Reflecting on this, one then understands that ceaselessly preserving the minimal, diminishing the minimal to achieve "harmony," and diminishing "harmony" to attain the "One." Yet those who attain the "One" possess no "One," and those who achieve "harmony" make no achievement. Dispersing their factions, wandering their courts, yin and yang reside within me yet do not betray their origin—then the greatest "increase" is achieved, what more could be added?]

The softest in the world gallops through the hardest. Non-being enters where there is no gap; thus I know the benefit of non-action. Teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain this.

Forty-Third Chapter
[Those who rush north to reach Yan, those who race south to reach Yue—yet the chariot with no destination always finds level ground without obstruction, traversing all things without resistance. One who unties with an awl cannot undo an untangled knot; one who splits with an axe cannot cleave unsplit firewood. If one knows that the solid contains the hollow and thus follows it, then no matter how myriad the changes, my will is never thwarted. Those who flaunt their "hardness" and prepare defenses, or measure gaps to exploit fissures, are many—this is why the Dao ultimately withdraws into the "nameable."]

Which is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Excessive love incurs great cost; hoarding leads to heavy loss. Thus, knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. [Xue Juncai says: Delighting in what one already has is enough—why seek further disgrace? Fearing future loss, one knows the peril of excess.] This is how one endures long.

Forty-Four Chapter
[What is called the "perfected person" is not one who distances themselves from things to live in isolation, sitting idly to watch changes, knowing that in the end, I cannot control things, nor can things control me. Thus, disgrace has its origins, yet disgrace may come without cause; danger summons itself, yet danger may arrive uninvited. However, if one hastily seizes misfortune to accept a "name," it would be better to remain without attachment. Therefore, one is said to skillfully cherish "name" and skillfully dwell in "wealth," skillfully embrace "gain" and skillfully relinquish "loss."

"Gain" for the self quietly dissolves the disharmony of yin and yang; "gain" for the world disperses the ferocity of tigers and rhinos.]

Great accomplishment seems incomplete, yet its use is inexhaustible. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless. Great straightness seems bent, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems inarticulate. Cold overcomes restlessness; stillness overcomes heat. [Sheng reads as "overcome." Ye Mengde says: Knowing what overcomes, what can one not achieve?] Purity and stillness govern the world. [When the world is governed, it governs itself. If one seeks to govern the world, one only increases its cold and heat.]

Forty-Fifth Chapter
[When yin and yang interact, human affairs become complicated; when human affairs complicate, achievements and fame become prominent. Thus, those who delight in action are drawn to what is full and flock to it. Yet when one attaches to what is already full, it must diminish oneself, leading to the desire to overcome it. I see them shivering in the cold and rushing to the fire, or sweltering in heat and drinking ice—only to exhaust themselves. Do they enjoy such suffering? Initially, they followed what was easy to seek fullness, unaware it would come to this. But if one conserves early, remains unmoved by things, then yin and yang grow naturally, without attachment to achievements or fame. Beginning without dependence, ending without competition, the world is governed, yet I seem to have done nothing. Thus, in appearance, one seems lacking, yet in reality, enjoys abundance. Truly enjoying it, why worry about appearances?]

When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields. When the world loses the Dao, warhorses breed in the suburbs. No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment; no fault is greater than the desire for gain. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is always sufficient.

Forty-Sixth Chapter
[Disaster arises from the heart’s core, while fortune hides in namelessness. A single trigger’s movement is like an ant’s burrow, yet the clash of myriad killings is like a river’s breach. Therefore, those who follow the Dao do not seek fortune first, and the world knows no disaster. Is this due to forced restraint? Understanding the excesses and harms of yin and yang, delighting in wandering the garden of great harmony—how could one, with one’s limited knowledge, transgress what must harm others?]

】Without stepping beyond the door, one knows the world;
【Zhang An says: To step beyond the door is to depart from this and acquire knowledge】
Without gazing through the window, one sees the Heavenly Dao.
【Zhang An says: To gaze through the window is to fix upon that and gain sight】
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling, sees without looking, accomplishes without acting.

Forty-Seventh Chapter
【The Dao fills the space between inclination and aversion.
Where there is inclination, there must be aversion.
Without inclination, without aversion—this may be called the center.
Yet people grope blindly all day in search of the center and fail to find it, becoming the world’s laughingstock.
If all else fails, one might try reversing course.
Reversal is not the center, yet gradually its boundaries appear.
Suddenly, like light streaming through a crack;
Subtly, like silk threading a loom.
Things impart knowledge to me, yet I need not strive—
Only then do I realize that those who once chased lost children and pursued runaway horses were both toilsome and foolish.
Otherwise, how could there be in the world those who "know without traveling, see without looking, accomplish without acting"?】

In learning, one daily accumulates;
In cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes.
Diminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To govern the world, one must act without interference;
When there is interference, it is no longer sufficient to govern the world.
【The world cannot be governed by seizing—what the world offers to me is called "seizing" alone.】

Forty-Eighth Chapter
【To diminish what is present is to augment what is absent.
Abandon what is seized, preserve what has not yet been seized.
Without seizing, there is no loss.
Thus, though one may host a hundred affairs, the world comes as a guest.
Yet if one clings stubbornly to past knowledge as an unchanging rule,
Each day brings accumulation of gain—and with it, mounting loss.
Thus the moon borrows brightness from the sun, yet with each dawn, the true moon dies.
How can one forsake this inexhaustible treasury to curry favor with the world’s eyes and ears?
The world is boundless: those who seize bring gratitude, but those who lose harbor resentment;
Those who gain find fulfillment, but those who lose suffer ruin.
This is why even the highest rites cannot escape grasping arms, and why countless carriages end up with no carriage at all.】

The sage is ever without a heart of his own, taking the hearts of the people as his heart.
To the good, I am good;
To the not good, I am also good—thus virtue is goodness.
To the trustworthy, I am trustworthy;
To the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—thus virtue is trustworthiness.
In the world, the sage is all-embracing,
Unifying the hearts of the world.
The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.

Forty-Ninth Chapter
【Even with a sage, how could the world’s people all become like children?
From the One arise Two, and with Two come yin and yang;
From yin and yang come nature and emotion;
From nature and emotion come right and wrong.
When nature and emotion congeal and cling to the semblances of yin and yang, will they then be taken as constant?
What is constant in this is inconstant in that.
Only by grasping the Great Constant without clinging to constancy
Can one let the extremes of yang’s excess and yin’s stagnation run their course,
So that the people may await their arrival as passively as scorched earth or flooding waters;
As gently as a breeze, while the people become like panpipes and zithers.
If there is overflow yet no reception, if there is sound yet no retention,
Then goodness comes to roost like a child learning speech beside its elders—
How much more so for those who fix their ears and eyes on what is not good?
Alas! Many in the world have eyes and fix their gaze—
Those who make themselves a target will also be gazed upon.
The sage does not become a target, and thus the world becomes childlike from this.】

From birth to death.

From birth to death—
Those bound for life number thirteen;
those bound for death number thirteen;
and those who, while alive, move toward death’s realm also number thirteen.
[Su Ziyou says: "Nine are the paths of life and death, yet there is one path of neither life nor death."]
Why is this so?
Because they cling to life too heavily.

It is said that those skilled in nurturing life
walk the road without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,
enter the army without being struck by armor or blade.
The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger no place to unsheathe its claws,
the blade no place to lodge its edge.
Why is this so?
Because they dwell in no realm of death.

Chapter Fifty:
There are realms of death, but no realms of life.
Where there is no realm, there is life;
where there is a realm, there is death.
Let us examine this in detail.
When a person is born, the spirit abandons emptiness to take up function,
the form severs itself from solidity to cultivate the insubstantial—
is this not emergence?
Yet when qi makes emptiness its dwelling,
and form makes earth its substance,
is this not entry into death?

Nevertheless, having been born,
one assumes that what has emerged can be perpetuated,
drawing out threads to spawn further life,
roaming while clinging to a realm—
thus death is indeed death in stillness,
and life is also death in motion.
Those who die in motion
can be still, yet cannot be still within motion.
To be still within motion is to move within stillness,
to employ both motion and stillness while using neither.
To be still within motion is to name motion as stillness;
once named as stillness, stillness gladly returns to it—
this is what is meant by "maintaining stillness with single-mindedness."
To move within stillness is to name stillness as motion;
once named as motion, stillness revolves with it and does not die—
this is what is meant by "reversion is the movement of the Dao."

Thus, there are three who cling to realms,
three who take no realm as their realm,
and three who hasten toward realms yet ultimately attain no realm.
Beyond these nine, the subtlety of the One is difficult to express!
Yet those who nurture life employ motion,
and those who hasten toward death also employ motion.
How can this be demonstrated?
Those who nurture life worry over attaining a realm and move to depart from it.
Those who hasten toward death worry over not attaining a realm and move to enter it.
Though they daily traverse the boundary between emergence and entry,
how can they truly know motion?
How grave, then, is the peril of realms!
The rhinoceros’s assault must press upon the earth to display its power;
the blade’s killing must contend for a realm to secure victory.
When they encounter one who dwells in no realm,
all lose their murderous intent.
The killing is not in them—
death departs from me.
Thus, riding the wind’s sound, one moves lightly and well;
thus, Cloud General speaks freely and roams.

The Dao gives them life,
virtue nurtures them—
[The function of the Dao is called virtue.]
it shapes their forms,
and circumstances bring them to completion.
[All is the Dao’s spontaneity.]
Therefore, the myriad things
revere the Dao and honor virtue without exception.
The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—
nothing commands this, yet it is ever spontaneous.

Thus, the Dao gives them life,
virtue nurtures them;
it rears them, raises them,
brings them to fruition, ripens them,
fosters them, shelters them.
[Lu Xisheng says:
"Receiving its essence is called life;
containing its qi is called nurturing;
developing its form is called rearing;
nurturing its material is called raising;
weighing its completion is called fruition;
measuring its use is called ripening;
preserving its harmony is called fostering;
securing its life is called sheltering."]
It gives life yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
rears yet does not govern.
This is called profound virtue.

Chapter Fifty-One.

Since the Dao has already given life—why should I give life?
Since the Dao has already nurtured and sheltered—why should I act?
Why should I rear?

The neighbor cooks his granary’s grain to fill his own belly,
then smugly declares, “I fed myself”—who would believe him?
Yet he has never eaten from me,
and never fails to eat from this.

I alone perceive and know it,
follow and embrace it.
The world does not know me, yet accords me virtue;
I, in turn, have no choice but to accord it virtue.

Things take form,
circumstances reach completion.
Though I perceive and know them, I do not name them in words;
though I follow and embrace them, I do not alter or displace them.
Though those who accord me virtue do not know me,
through all ages they trust it.
Thus, because the myriad things do not know one another,
it may be called profound virtue.

The world has a beginning,
which serves as the world’s mother.
Once you grasp the mother,
you know her children.
If you then guard the mother,
you will not perish to the end of your days.

Block the openings,
shut the gates—
and you will not toil all your life.
Open the openings,
aid in affairs—
and you will not be saved all your life.

To see the small is called clarity;
to guard the soft is called strength.
Use its light,
return to its clarity,
and no misfortune will befall you.
This is called embracing the constant.

Chapter Fifty-Two.

[On “beginning,” there are three senses:
The Confucian speaks of beginning as holding authority;
the Buddhist speaks of beginning as encompassing all;
this “beginning” speaks of life-in-motion.
What moves in life is qi,
yet it is not merely qi.
If it were only qi,
then as it moves in life there,
here it would already be hollow.
Filled there, not empty here;
born before Heaven and Earth,
yet dying after Heaven and Earth;
its breath so subtle, its use without trace.
Small and without attachment—how much more so the great?
Weak and not needing “use”—how much more so “strength”?
Whom then could we follow to attain our “seeing” and “guarding”?

Thus, when we “guard” and “know,”
“knowing” lies in “guarding”;
when we “know” and “guard,”
“guarding” lies in “knowing.”
Life and breath endless,
the mechanism ripples in the vast.
Seek to grasp it, and it has already fled;
seek to examine it, and it has already shifted.
Swift and fleeting, scattered and dispersed—
where is the “constant”?
Yet within its inconstancy,
it secretly embodies the “constant.”
How could this lie at the bounds of “child” and “mother”?

If not so—
with the limited use of one’s own knowledge and strength,
chasing the transformations of “child” and “mother,”
one will hardly escape misfortune.]

Were I to have even a little knowledge,
and walk the great Dao,
I would fear only deviation.
The great Dao is level,
yet people prefer byways.

The court is swept clean,
the fields lie fallow,
the granaries are empty.
Yet they wear embroidered robes,
bear sharp swords,
gorge on food and drink,
hoard surplus wealth—
these are the pipes of thieves.
How could this be the Dao?

Chapter Fifty-Three: *The Malady of Zhou’s Flourishing Culture*

The world cannot endure "knowledge."
When "knowledge" is put into practice,
the true forms of things die within one’s ears and eyes,
and ears and eyes, too, will die within those forms.

Then should knowledge be abandoned?
Yet knowledge cannot be abandoned.
There are those who possess knowledge,
and those who employ my knowledge.
The knower claims long-standing mastery,
while the one who employs my knowledge uses only its "fragmentary" aspect.
Knowing the impermanence of the "fragmentary,"
one harbors no lingering attachments.
With no lingering attachments,
the world does not envy what one clings to.
Though practice may not be feared,
how much less so knowledge?

A fleeting gleam,
yet the reliance of a lifetime;
what one exalts,
others will follow and exalt.
Wang Mang and Cao Cao revering Yao and Shun as their *yu*,
the Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows revering Tang and Wu as their *yu*—
these are no different from the perverse qi of yin and yang
revering stagnant, congealed qi as their *yu*,
thereby stealing life.

That the Dao cannot be walked in a "fragmentary" manner—
is it not thus?

The well-established cannot be uprooted—
*(Lü Jifu says: "Established through constant non-being.")*
The well-embraced cannot slip away—
*(Lü Jifu says: "Embracing spirit through stillness.")*
Thus descendants maintain unbroken sacrifices.

Cultivated in the self,
its virtue becomes authentic;
cultivated in the family,
its virtue becomes abundant;
cultivated in the village,
its virtue becomes enduring;
cultivated in the state,
its virtue becomes bountiful;
cultivated throughout the world,
its virtue becomes universal.

Therefore, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

**Chapter Fifty-Four**
*(When one establishes self, world, state, and family, they divide into factions.
That faction "establishes," while this faction is "uprooted";
that faction "embraces," while this faction "slips away."
Yet can one of the Dao forcibly equalize and apply both?
Affairs each have their form, circumstances each their shape—
observing accordingly, one may avoid contention.
Flowing within these shapes and circumstances,
using what cannot be used to make them self-reliant—
this is called "knowing through this."
When there is no "self," what "observation" of self?
When there is no village, state, or world, what "observation" of mine?
When there is no "this," then there is "this."
Dissolving what is natural, coalescing what is inevitable—
not only do factions vanish, but the truth of self and things appears,
liquefying and interpenetrating, solidifying into endless longevity.
This is called "dying yet not perishing.")*

One whose virtue is profoundly stored
is like a newborn child.

A venomous creature does not sting him,
a fierce beast does not seize him,
a grasping bird does not strike him.
His bones are weak, his sinews soft, yet his grip is firm.
He knows not the union of male and female, yet his organ stirs—
such is the perfection of his essence.
He cries all day without growing hoarse—
such is the perfection of his harmony.
[Viewed thus, man is never without essence, never without harmony.
Yet if one were to establish teaching on this basis,
there would still be those who cling to the crash of a falling object as their original face.]

To know harmony is called "constancy,"
to know constancy is called "clarity."
To seek excess in life is called "ominous."
[To seek to augment one’s life is to invite disaster.]
The heart that commands qi is called "forceful."
[Qi arises from essence and harmony, yet one forces it to be hard and restless.]

When things reach their prime, they age—
this is called "not following the Dao,"
what does not follow the Dao perishes early.

[Chapter 55]

To bear alone the boundlessness of all under heaven is impossible.
Anxious that it cannot be borne, one’s heart races and qi scatters,
inner strife erupts and outward betrayal follows.
Yet still one establishes virtue as virtue,
spewing it forth as an external display,
unaware that within there is no clarity.
To contain and be like a newborn child is to have virtue without establishing virtue;
when virtue does not establish virtue,
taking and rejecting leave no trace;
no trace, then there is "harmony."
Not establishing virtue as virtue,
yin and yang return to unity,
yin and yang return to unity, then there is "essence."
Such a one—though immeasurably rich, needs no resources,
though immensely strong, cannot be broken—
could there yet be the afflictions of "commanding qi" or "augmenting life"?
Thus, close the doors and windows,
and the six directions cease to exist;
guard it in deep slumber,
and wind and thunder vanish.

The perfected person embodies boundless transformation,
as the infant manifests effortless resonance.

Those who know do not speak;
those who speak do not know.
Not only do they prevent others from glimpsing their joy or anger,
but they also ensure the Dao remains unbroken by union or separation.

Block the apertures, seal the gates,
blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,
harmonize the radiance, merge with the dust—
this is called "mysterious sameness."

Thus, they cannot be drawn near,
nor can they be kept distant;
approach them, and they seem utterly unlike,
yet turn away, and they do not depart from this.

They cannot be benefited,
nor can they be harmed;
rain cannot moisten the void to bring forth life,
nor can the sun scorch the void to produce heat.

They cannot be exalted,
nor can they be debased.
Exaltation and debasement are but names—
from exaltation arises debasement.
Without names, there is neither exaltation nor debasement,
and thus they are honored by all under heaven.

As Yan Junping said:
The five flavors linger on the tongue, the five tones resonate in the ear—
what is sweet is not truly sweet, what is bitter is not truly bitter,
what is *shang* is not truly *shang*, what is *yu* is not truly *yu*,
yet Yi Ya and Shi Kuang could distinguish them.
If even sounds and flavors are thus,
how much more so the subtle Dao?
The perfected person’s dwelling and movement—
when manifest, they share the same root with the myriad things;
when hidden, they merge their origin with emptiness and nothingness.
Speech and silence adapt to the moment without distinction,
spontaneous words arise daily to respond to change—
this is truly called "mysterious sameness."

Chapter Fifty-Six

If one seeks to align with what is alike,
then one must also diverge from what is different.
What I esteem, others may despise;
what I despise, others may esteem—
why is this?
Because my esteem reveals others’ disdain,
and my disdain reveals others’ esteem.
Only one who does not transgress against things
will find that things do not transgress against them.
Not that they do not transgress—
things simply cannot transgress against them at all.
Thus, they let things drift and dissolve,
sit and grow old with them,
whether bright as a row of torches,
dark as sunken earth,
sharp as Gan Jiang’s blade,
or tangled as a skein of silk—
they listen to the endless flux of right and wrong
yet never contend for sameness as a mark of worth.
Thus, they rise above all under heaven,
gazing upon the fortunes and misfortunes of the world.

Profound! Profound indeed!

Yet how can mere words suffice to establish this?

Govern the state with uprightness,
deploy troops with cunning,
and take all under heaven through non-action.
How do I know this is so?
By this:
The more taboos under heaven, the poorer the people grow;
the more sharp tools people possess, the more benighted the state becomes;
the more skill and craft proliferate, the more strange things arise;
the more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear.
Thus the sage declares:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;
I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;
I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves;
I harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.

Chapter Fifty-Seven

There are things under heaven that remain ungoverned—yet when one seeks to govern them, nothing but "uprightness" can achieve success. Using "uprightness" to correct what is not upright, how can one know that what is called "upright" will not itself become crooked? Thus "uprightness" must lead to "cunning," and governing the state must lead to deploying troops.

Now, one who practices non-action corrects what uprightness corrects yet does not govern—so even those who might wish to employ cunning find themselves obstructed by the absence of suspicion, and I thereby sit and take all under heaven. Those who are ever-active and meddlesome do otherwise, saying, "Governance is the natural state of things, while deploying troops is my last resort." Just as they share with all under heaven the peace and prosperity of stability, to call this a last resort—whose sorrow is this deception meant to assuage?

Thus, without names, there are no implements;
without implements, there is no advantage;
without advantage, there is no craft;
without craft, laws have nothing to test.
Therefore, those who wish to end warfare must first abandon governance.

The governance of the Dao is dull and unadorned, and its people are simple and sincere;
its governance is sharp and exacting, and its people are lacking and deficient.
Thus the sage is square but does not cut,
is sharp-edged but does not wound,
is straight but does not stretch,
is radiant but does not dazzle.

Misfortune—how fortune leans upon it;
fortune—how misfortune lies hidden within it.
Who knows their ultimate end?
There is no fixed norm.

[Having circled and soared through the interplay of principle and fate, one comes to know there is no fixed norm. Those who sharply discern and rush to welcome fortune while shunning misfortune believe there is a fixed norm.]

The fixed norm reverts to the strange,
goodness reverts to the ominous.
People’s delusion has endured for so long.

(Chapter 58)

[If there truly is no "fixed norm," then why does the sage not also discard "square," "sharp-edged," "straight," and "radiant"? To discard is necessarily to overcorrect, and today’s overcorrection becomes what later generations must correct. When a bow is drawn, its back bends outward; when released, its back bends inward. Does this mean nothing in the world can ever be right?

The sage, knowing there is no fixed norm, also knows there is no strange—only ever following the mean. "What people fear, one dare not fail to fear": thus the good cannot wield names to impose demands. "All under heaven fix their gaze upon me, and I treat them all as children": thus the unvirtuous cannot erect barriers to contend. Therefore, by keeping far from the harm of "cutting," "wounding," "stretching," and "dazzling," and by preserving the shelter of "square," "sharp-edged," "straight," and "radiant," the workings of fate lose their good and ominous turns, and the strange and the fixed norm are forgotten in name and reality.

Otherwise, seeking fortune by avoiding misfortune through accommodation only deepens delusion and hastens the ominous.]

Governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality.
To be frugal is to be early in compliance;
early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue.
[Han Fei says: Thoughts settled, thus virtue does not depart;
the apertures empty, then harmonious qi enters daily.]
With repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing that cannot be overcome;
nothing that cannot be overcome—then none know its limit.
None knowing its limit, one may possess the state.
Possessing the state’s foundational power, one may endure long.
This is called the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, of long life and enduring vision.

Chapter Fifty-Nine
[The passions of "people" are boundless; to take and "govern" them is to fall short of most passions. The reckonings of "Heaven" are infinite; to proceed and "serve" them is to find the unattainable ever distant. Following their exhausting exhaustions, chasing their vast vastness—this hopes for that one’s favor, while that one hopes for this, breeding resentment. Resentment cannot sustain a state, and exhausting oneself year after year also rots the "root" and withers the "stem," so that one’s "life" does not extend. By the time it fails to extend, regretfully seeking "compliance"—is it not too late!

Abiding at the center of the circle, there is little to "govern," little to "serve." Though passions are myriad, the passionate are one; though reckonings are myriad, the reckoning reckoners are not one. Some suspect stinginess and lack of virtue, yet the virtue of non-virtue means Heaven and humanity harbor no expectations at the outset, and thus no resentment or sorrow at the end. Yet in striking aside to guide the joints, provisions are inexhaustible—can there ever be an end?

Thus the male’s butting has its limit, while the female’s receptivity knows no cease. The one who "repeatedly accumulates virtue" finds the world drawn to her receptivity and returning to me. Seated in emptiness to discourse with all under Heaven—this is how the twofold difficulty of "possessing the state" and "enduring long" are both resolved here. Resolved here, then what could fail to be resolved here?]

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
With the Dao presiding over all under Heaven, its ghosts do not act as spirits;
Not that its ghosts do not act as spirits, but their spirit does not harm people;
Not that their spirit does not harm people, but the sage also does not harm people.
When the two do not harm one another, their virtues converge and return together.

Chapter Sixty

To move the forms of all under Heaven is to leave behind its qi;
To move the qi of all under Heaven is to move without remainder.
"Cooking a small fish" yet disturbing it—though the small fish itself is never harmed, its qi is already injured.
When its qi is injured, the qi then rises in rebellion and retaliates.
All under Heaven has its "ghosts and spirits," kneading order and chaos in the formless;
Our bodies have their "ghosts and spirits," stirring life and death in the formless.
The moment the mechanism of killing stirs, dragons and serpents rise from the land, and the power of life is ravaged.
In stillness, there is nothing; in motion, there is something—when spirits "harm people," how fearful!
"Bearing the soul and embracing the One without parting"—
preserve them together in the water before it ripples.
How could one govern all under Heaven?
Simply "preside" over it.

The great state lies in the lower reaches, the female of all under Heaven, the confluence of all under Heaven.
The female ever overcomes the male through stillness, through stillness holds the lower position.
【Stillness dwelling below, profound virtue bears all things.】
Thus when the great state humbles itself before the small state, it wins the small state;
when the small state humbles itself before the great state, it wins the great state.
Therefore, some humble themselves to win, some humble themselves and win.
The great state desires only to shelter and nurture others;
the small state desires only to enter and serve others.
Both obtain what they desire, yet the greater should take the lower position.

Chapter Sixty-One
【The Dao’s subtlety lies in receptivity.
To be receptive yet move—this is called "receptive" in name but not in reality.
To desire receptivity and move—this is truly receptive in reality but not in name.
All under Heaven responds in reality but contends over names;
yin and yang in relation to humanity are inherently thus—how much more so human affairs?
Pushed to its extreme, the desire to "shelter and nurture others" is not truly nurturing others;
the desire to "enter and serve others" is not truly serving others.
Why? Reality is originally movement—how much less can one remain still when desire is involved?
The greater it is, the more it can receive.
If one can become the convergence of yin and yang, one’s position below becomes even more pronounced.
Still the desires, still the movements—this is how rivers and seas become the kings of all valleys.】
The Dao is the mystery of the ten thousand things.

The treasure of the good person is what the unvirtuous cling to.
Fair words can purchase esteem, and esteemed conduct can be imposed upon others.
【Though the unvirtuous cling to it, this is why the good is prized.
Yet if one could purchase esteem but does not, could impose but does not—this is the mystery.】
Why discard those who are not good?
Thus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,
though one may offer a large jade disk before a team of four horses,
it is not equal to quietly presenting this Dao.

Why was this Dao prized in ancient times?
Was it not said: "Seek and you shall obtain; with transgressions, you shall be absolved"?
Thus it is treasured under Heaven.

Chapter Sixty-Two
【By this we may verify: does the one who embodies the Dao necessarily make no requests, nor ever conceal transgressions?
To make no requests is to be cut off; to conceal transgressions is to invite defilement—one who embodies the Dao does not dwell in these.
All under Heaven lies within the Dao; the good and the unvirtuous are but its transformative traces, while the Dao is their bellows and pipes.
Thus, there is nothing to choose, and one may deepen one’s breath thereby.
To know there is something to choose is to value the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes, to prize the large jade disk and the team of four horses as mere ornament—how could this be the Dao?
At times one may seek, yet never hoard treasure to isolate oneself;
one may wish to avoid transgression, yet never lose one’s safeguard to stand alone.
Harmonizing right and wrong and resting in the balance of Heaven,
all under Heaven becomes one with the Dao—who then could deem it base?】

To act without acting, to manage without managing, to savor the savorless.
Great or small, many or few—repay resentment with virtue.
[Lü Jifu says: Returning to nothingness, thus one may be great, may be small, may be many, may be few.]

Plan for difficulty while it is still easy; achieve greatness while it is still small.
The world’s difficult tasks must begin with what is easy; the world’s great tasks must begin with what is minute.
Thus the sage never strives for greatness, and so accomplishes greatness.
One who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted; one who treats much as easy will meet much difficulty.
Thus the sage treats all as difficult, and so ultimately meets no difficulty.

Chapter Sixty-Three
[What stirs growth and nurtures life—this is what people call “great.”
The exchange of kindness and resentment—this is what people call “difficult.”
Autumn’s fallen leaves are spring’s flourishing;
dense clouds gather, and rain dissolves them—
not that they are truly “great” or “difficult,” as careful observation reveals.
Is the Dao not like water?
Emerging subtly from peril, its flowing current never brims.
When full, it follows the end and appears full, unaware of the source that sustains it.
Were it so, the sage would be exhausted—
yet by relying on nothingness, he remains unwearied.
Without “greatness,” he is as if “minute”; without “ease,” he is as if “difficult.”
Preserving nothingness, he finds nothing beyond his grasp.
What is difficult? Only to preserve nothingness.]

What is secure is easy to hold; what shows no sign is easy to plan for.
What is fragile is easy to dissolve; what is subtle is easy to scatter.
[The Dao inherently possesses these four subtle signs.]
Act before things arise; govern before disorder begins.
A tree of arm-span girth grows from a tiny sprout;
a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;
a journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one’s feet.
[Even when fully grown, it still has its sprout; even when complete, it still relies on piled earth—though a thousand miles, it is no more than a step.]
One who acts fails; one who grasps loses.
[Su Ziyou says: Contending with misfortune for victory, adding to fortune as excess—thus misfortune cannot be averted, and fortune cannot be achieved.]
Thus the sage does not act, and so does not fail; does not grasp, and so does not lose.
People in their undertakings often fail when nearly complete.
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure.
Thus the sage desires what others do not desire, does not prize rare and precious goods;
learns what others do not learn, restores what the multitude has passed over.
[Liu Zhongping says: Desiring what others do not desire, not desiring what others desire;
learning what others do not learn, not learning what others learn—
thus restoring what they have passed over.]
He relies on the spontaneity of the myriad things and does not dare to act.

Chapter Sixty-Four
[Those who lose the Dao do not seek good fortune first or add to blessings as excess.
To govern by anticipating what has not yet arisen or what is not yet in disorder is to act by meeting too soon.
To be cautious when nearly complete is to act by following too closely.
That meeting and following are not the Dao has long been so—
is it not because they constantly go back and forth and thus fall into exhaustion?
Who knows that what has gone is even now coming, and what is coming is even now going?
And who knows that what has gone has never truly gone, and what is coming has never truly come?
Beware of following, for it begins as if meeting;
beware of meeting, for it begins as if following.
And who knows that meeting and following can be avoided, while avoiding meeting and following can also be guarded against?
Whether exhausted or avoided, one follows things.
To guard against both and attend to what is easy is to follow the Dao.
One who follows things is not constant; one who follows the Dao attains unity.
With unity, nothing to rely on—anticipating signs and “serving early”—
this is how one “relies on the spontaneity of the myriad things and does not dare to act.”]

Those of old who were skilled in the Dao did not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.

The people are difficult to govern because they possess too much knowledge.
Thus, governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane;
governing the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing.
To know these two is also a model.
Always knowing this model is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue runs deep and far, moving contrary to things,
and this contrariness leads to great compliance.

[Lu Jifu says: To return to the root contrary to things is to go against the current.]

The people are difficult to govern because they possess too much knowledge.
Thus, those who govern with knowledge are the state’s bane;
those who govern without knowledge are the state’s blessing.
To know these two is also a model.
Always knowing this model is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue runs deep and far, moving contrary to things,
and this contrariness leads to great compliance.

When one complies, one grows with the world—
growing knowledge, growing ignorance;
growing fortune, growing misfortune;
growing virtue, growing bane.
Nothing is certain in what grows, and compliance does not endure.
In guarding, I guard myself, and the world guards itself,
without mutual instruction.
The Dao’s way of bestowing this world is such that
the world does not belong to me, nor I to the world—
this “model” has long been thus and remains unchanging.
If one imitates this “model” by multiplying jars and urns,
the earth will crack upon the hills;
if one learns this “pattern” by multiplying ritual vessels,
the trees will wither upon the mountains.
Would the world then be my jars and urns, my ritual vessels?
They would not submit, and resentment and harm would arise.
When things desire to sprout, and I stop them at the bud,
the world preserves its richness.
When the heart desires to sprout, and I stop it at the incipient,
the hun and po preserve their constant brightness.
This is not to “make them simple” by design—
what is called “enlightening” is not true enlightenment.

The reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
is that they are good at lying low.
Thus, if the sage wishes to be above the people,
he must speak as if below them;
if he wishes to lead the people,
he must place himself behind them.
Thus, the sage dwells above, yet the people do not feel burdened—
[the people do not feel burdened, for the weight remains with him.
Generally, the higher is light and the lower heavy.
To dwell above without imposing weight on others—
only the sage can do this.]
He dwells ahead, yet the people do not feel harmed.
Thus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring.
Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.

[To lower oneself is not easy; to be “good at lowering” is even harder.
Thus, few in the world become rivers and seas.
If one seeks to suppress, the reaction will surely be extreme;
if one seeks to dredge, it will only deepen the unevenness.
And this is not all.]

Standing alone yet drawing all things to itself—such accumulation must be profound. When accumulation is profound yet nothing is discharged, attempts to suppress or dredge it will fail. Thus, only rivers and seas are "adept at lowering." Rivers flow into the sea, and the sea has its tail-gate. When the sage possesses virtue, transgressions pass without lingering. Receiving the world’s submission yet never sated, how could the world grow weary of him? Therefore, he returns his breath to his heels, his heels to heaven, illumines all with spontaneity, and transforms his long-held qi, entering the "Vast Heavenly Oneness."

The world says my Dao is great, yet seems formless. Precisely because it is great, it appears formless. Were it to take form, it would long since have been diminished! I possess three treasures, which I hold and preserve:
The first is compassion,
the second is frugality,
the third is not daring to place myself before the world.
Compassion enables courage;
frugality enables abundance;
not daring to place myself before the world enables me to become the vessel’s chief.
Now, to abandon compassion yet claim courage,
to abandon frugality yet claim abundance,
to abandon humility yet claim precedence—
this is death!
With compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.
Heaven will save such a one, shielding him with compassion.

A skilled warrior is not martial;
a master of war is not enraged;
one who conquers the enemy does not engage;
one who employs others places himself below them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
the power of employing others’ strength,
the alignment with heaven’s ancient ultimate.

Avoiding killing cannot endure, just as delighting in killing cannot last. Some act from desire, others from aversion—both claim life and death lie in their grasp, usurping heaven’s authority. If one does not indulge in delight, what need is there for avoidance? Thus, those who "govern with uprightness" seek to quell arms, yet arms arise all the more. The "skilled warrior" may deploy troops, yet no harm is done. To know heaven’s transformative traces is to see thunder and lightning without joy or anger. To know the ancient "model" is to witness growth and decline without killing or giving life. How could one who embodies the Dao employ others by asserting himself? He follows what is already so and thus employs them.

On the use of arms, there is a saying:
I dare not act as host, but as guest;
I dare not advance an inch, but retreat a foot.
This is called marching without ranks,
striking without arms,
seizing without foes,
wielding without weapons.
No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.
Thus, when evenly matched forces meet,
the grieving side prevails.

The Dao in the world is no different.
Yet this is but one instance—Chapter Sixty-Nine.

Abiding in the palace of the Dao, one is neither "host" nor "guest";
riding the momentum of the Dao, one both "advances" and "retreats."
Yet the "host" knows not the "guest," while the "guest" knows the "host"—
through their mutual knowledge, one infers the use of neither "host" nor "guest."
"Advance" leaves no ground for "retreat," while "retreat" holds ground for "advance"—
by its surplus space, one seizes the subtlety of both "advance" and "retreat."
Between "host" and "guest" lies a palace;
beyond "advance" and "retreat" lies their application.
"Without ranks," "without arms," "without foes," "without weapons"—
such is this way.
Avoiding deadly ground to attain "subtle clarity,"
what else awaits if not victory?
Should one seek this momentum in haste yet fail to grasp it,
what then is to be done?
Is there not recourse in reversing the situation and employing its nature?
Proceeding with "grief" in one’s "inevitability,"
one restrains one’s anger and does not lose one’s "Three Treasures."

My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.

The world knows it not, practices it not.
Words have their lineage, affairs have their lord.
Only through unknowing—
【things follow their nature, not my words, not my deeds,
yet I too abide therein unknowing】—
do they fail to know me.
Those who know me are rare,
thus those who emulate me are precious.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

Chapter Seventy

Great clamor arises from great silence,
great life begins in non-life.
Riding its clamor to harmonize with it—
harmony cannot prevail.
Chasing its transformations to nurture them—
nurturing cannot prevail.
Blowing through reed pipes with the lips,
the fingers cannot pluck the zither;
gazing upward to catch the cicada,
one cannot stoop to seize the grub.
Thus the world’s words become lips or fingers;
the world’s affairs become catching or seizing.
Ever chasing what is difficult yet never encountering it,
one hollowly boasts of one’s vast knowledge—
how could there be those who truly know me?
My own dwelling in "rarity"—
can the world not but "rare" itself?
Thus the great valley holds no faintest sound,
and the great transformation bears no infant form.

Rejecting clamor and remaining unmoved by change,
one dons coarse cloth to delight in this "ease,"
while holding jade within to subtly embody its "rarity."

To know yet to know not—this is noble;
to know not yet to know—this is sickness.
The sage is not sick, for he sickens of sickness.
Only by sickening of sickness does one not fall sick.

Chapter Seventy-One
Heaven and earth employ the world to toil me—only when they know me;
they appoint me to carve up the world—only when they know the world.
How could it be merely that the world cannot be fully known?
Even the knower, leaning at the edge of bounds, loses the flowing current.
Thus the sage, with oxen, forgets the plow;
with horses, forgets the harness;
with fields, forgets the tilling;
with timber, forgets the vessel.
Oblivious to himself, he does not see his storehouse;
oblivious to the world, he has no office to hold.
As for those who regulate the realm of the ten thousand clans
and emulate the positions of the hundred bones,
there are already those who came before me, peddling their surplus knowledge.
Just as they imitate it to toil themselves,
and suffer from its many omissions,
sinking and floating in new knowledge,
fleeing old vessels—
how could they not fall sick?

When the people do not fear power, then great power arrives.
[Li Xizhai says: "When the people do not fear power, none but those who have forgotten both self and world can achieve this."]
Do not encroach upon their dwelling,
do not weary their livelihood.
Only by not wearying them do they not grow weary.
Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself;
loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Therefore, he discards that and takes this.

Chapter Seventy-Two

Those who indulge in being perish in non-being,
filling their voids only augments their fullness.
Lift a hand or cast a glance—nowhere is not "narrow";
lift a hand or cast a glance—nowhere is not "weary."

There are those who *dwell*, and those who dwell *in dwelling*;
there are those who *live*, and those who live *in living*.
Those who dwell *in dwelling* merge with the inner reaches of dwelling,
vast and boundless, swirling and turning, broader than heaven and earth.
Those who live *in living* preserve the harmony of living,
gentle and yielding, carefree and at ease, delighting in the spring terrace.
Yet to abandon one’s own joy, to block one’s own vastness—how lamentable!
Restless through the night, unable to rely on oneself, seeking aid in "power."

Thus, discard "display" and one’s narrowness becomes vast;
discard "exaltation" and joy is no longer dependent on joy.
Daily wandering in tranquility and distance,
dissolving the boundless,
expansive with abundance,
fulfilled with aptness.
Forget the world and it becomes no burden;
the world, too, will forget you.

For those who dwell *in dwelling* and live *in living* are the world’s inherent nature—
why then should I "display" or "exalt" anything?

Courage in daring leads to death;
courage in not-daring leads to life.
These two—one brings benefit, the other harm.
Who knows the reason for what Heaven abhors?

The Way of Heaven:
triumphs without contention,
responds without speech,
arrives without summons,
plans with ease and spaciousness.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
sparse yet never failing.

Chapter Seventy-Three

Grasping "not-daring" with "courage" is *daring* indeed;
"not-daring" in what one "does not dare" is *courage* indeed.
The application of "courage" and "daring"
brings the retribution of "death" and "life."
Heaven wields its authority,
while we endure its changes—how *difficult*!

The sage fears this "difficulty,"
yet embraces "life,"
without shunning "death."
Thus "life" rests with oneself,
while "death" is left to the world.
Why? If one claims "life" for oneself,
there must be those who bear "death"—
such is the inevitability of qi and fate,
beyond reproach.

Only when one’s own "life" is not a matter of merit,
and the world’s "death" cannot be blamed,
does one stand beyond reward and punishment,
skillfully saving all beings.
I am free of "death" and "life,"
and the world, too, attains "life."

Those bound by qi and fate
toil endlessly over "death" and "life,"
while to me,
they are but the whistling of a sword’s tip.
Thus the sage breaks through "Heaven’s net"
to follow the "Way of Heaven."

The people do not fear death—why threaten them with it? If the people could always be made to fear death, then for those who act perversely, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? There is always an executioner who kills. To take the executioner’s place in killing is like taking the master carpenter’s place in hewing—those who replace the master carpenter in hewing rarely avoid injuring their own hands.

Chapter Seventy-Four

Wood meets the axe—how could it evade being split, whether hard or brittle? Thus Robber Zhi and Bao Jiao mocked each other endlessly. To pick apart their mockery, deeming some right and some wrong, and cling to chaff to force belief upon those who firmly disbelieve—this is to exploit another’s death to prove one’s own gain, seeking profit from it. Those who delight in killing harm nothing in the world, yet only strip away their own harmony.

The sage, knowing the inevitability of such patterns, pities Heaven and witnesses the transformations with open eyes. Transformations daily shift, and one cannot but yield to them; to yield to transformation while mourning it is profound indeed. Does one seek the reputation of near-benevolence? Those who claim the office of life to replace Heaven in giving life—just as they replace Heaven in killing—are fools. The sage never acts the fool, and thus appears unworthy.

The people’s hunger comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—thus they hunger. The people’s unruliness comes from their superiors’ meddling—thus they are unruly. The people’s disregard for death comes from their superiors’ lavish pursuit of life—thus they disregard death. Only one who takes no thought for life excels those who prize it.

Chapter Seventy-Five
Those who consume taxes are the superiors; those who hunger are the people. Those who meddle are the superiors; those who are unruly are the people. Though they do not know one another, they depend on each other—this is indeed so. To govern our lives while desiring to preserve them is no different from raising livestock. Who knows that though they do not know one another, they depend on each other? Are liver and gallbladder as distant as the northern Hu and southern Yue?

Thus, if you equate their differences, then liver and gallbladder become Hu and Yue; if you distinguish their sameness, then liver and gallbladder become Hu and Yue. In that there is this, in this there is that; that and this complete each other, and life and death do not contradict. How can all be so lavishly valued that none know what is slight? If one subtly makes them aware, then sinews, bones, blood, and flesh all become hollow, while emptiness and nothingness become full.

Thus it is said: “Empty yet used, it is never filled.” Truly, it is never filled—knowing how to enter without obstruction, why would one prize life so heavily and treat death so lightly?

Chapter Seventy-Six
When people are alive, they are supple and weak; when dead, they are stiff and strong. When plants and trees are alive, they are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus, the stiff and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life. Therefore, when armies grow strong, they perish; when trees grow strong, they are felled. Dong Sijing said: “People unite to attack what is strong and great; the lowly and weak remain above.”

Strength and weakness are but traces. How could a tree desire life and thus deliberately remain soft and fragile? When the celestial fluid does not reach it and only dregs remain, the form of stiffness and withering takes shape. Thus, stiffness and strength are accumulations of being; suppleness and weakness are transformations of non-being. If the transformation of non-being is still sufficient for life, how much more so what has not yet transformed? When forced to employ this transformation to remain supple and weak, it is because it has not strayed far from non-being. Without that strength, the supple would not congeal—this is how the world thickly cultivates its substance. Yet who knows that congealing is already the companion of death? Though substance is firmly established and cannot be without, when it employs the emptiness of Heaven and Earth to rise and fall, then not only is what remains above supple and weak, but even what lies below is far from withered and dry.

The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow: what is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted; what is excessive is reduced, what is insufficient is supplemented. The Way of Heaven reduces excess to supplement insufficiency. The way of man is not so—it reduces insufficiency to serve excess. Who can have excess to offer the world? Only one with the Dao. Thus, the sage acts without relying, accomplishes without dwelling, and does not wish to display worth.

Chapter Seventy-Seven
Only when a bow has “high” and “low” can one apply “pressing down” and “lifting up.” Only when people have “excess” and “insufficiency” can Heaven apply “reducing” and “supplementing.” Those who reduce themselves certainly do not lack reduction, but those who receive Heaven’s reduction suffer dire misfortune. The sage’s ability to avoid Heaven’s misfortune lies in not bringing misfortune upon the earth. How could only those who labor the world to serve themselves be serving excess? People are not yet unworthy yet desire to be worthy; they are not yet chaotic yet desire to govern. When fine reputations come their way and foul rumors are bestowed as gifts, is this not delighting in the world’s failure to perfect oneself? Thus, when one person rests securely in position, the world loses its footing; when one day’s will is carried out, a hundred men grieve. The impulse to kill arises from proclamations and oaths, and warhorses are born from merit and fame. Then how can the common man’s frugal self-service and the worthy man’s lavish self-service not be feared?

Nothing in the world is weaker than water, yet nothing can overcome what is hard and strong—nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard, none in the world do not know, yet none can practice it. Thus, the sage says: “Receiving the world’s filth, one is called lord of the altars of soil and grain; receiving the world’s misfortune, one is called king of all under Heaven.” Straightforward words seem contradictory.

Chapter Seventy-Eight

Without the power to "attack," yet harboring the intent to "attack," the mind stirs its power. Without the intent to "attack," yet possessing the power to "attack," the power unsettles the mind. When mind and power are both sufficient for "attack," each vies for dominance, and within the self, each clutches its spear and halberd, ever shifting. Yet to seek to "attack" all under Heaven—none have succeeded without crumbling.

Nevertheless, nothing is more perilous than the mind. Now, does water ever desire to oppose the hard and strong as an attacker? It bears the world’s "filth," yet through all ages, its intent remains unchanged, and its power follows. Why? Water’s lack of power is equal to its lack of intent; water’s lack of intent is equal to its lack of power.

Thus, one who "weakens their will" has no "changing will"; one who "empties their mind" has no "changing mind." Acting only where unavoidable, unaware of hardness or strength, peril or ease give no cause for altered concern—nothing more, than lodging the mind in boundlessness while inwardly free from self-entanglement. Lodging the mind in boundlessness, nothing is feared. Inwardly free from self-entanglement, harmony is perfected.

Harmony within, fearlessness without—who under Heaven can withstand it?

To reconcile great resentment, residual resentment must remain.

To repay resentment with virtue—how can this be deemed good? Thus the sage holds the left tally, yet makes no demand upon others. [The left tally is what the debtor holds to account for what is owed, merely awaiting the creditor’s claim.] One with virtue oversees the tally; one without virtue enforces uniformity. [Uniformity means to penetrate and equalize all things.] The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it ever accords with the good.

[Li Xizhai says: It, too, merely oversees the tally.]

Chapter Seventy-Nine

Since one does not wish to attack, one then “harmonizes” with it. For those who would act in the world, there is no other path but these two. Things are fundamentally equal—what need is there for me to penetrate them? If things are not penetrated, how then can I equalize them? Without intent, without power, resentment naturally does not grow. Those with intent find their minds settled and released; those with power find their strength exhausted and turn back. Not waiting for them to come to me at their wits’ end, but instead hastening to meet them with the virtue of equalizing and penetrating—this only deepens their resentment, and the resentment returns to me.

The sage, knowing this, sits and dissolves the shifts of yin and yang’s excesses and deficiencies, and Heaven naturally settles itself. The oppositions of stillness and motion, cold and heat, he sits and overcomes, and the body naturally finds peace. The disputes of Confucians and Mohists, right and wrong, he sits and illuminates, and the Dao naturally unifies itself. There is no other way: with no partiality, there is no estrangement; things seek, and one grants—yet the self does not impose.

A small state with few people.
Let them have tools of ten or a hundred times the utility yet not use them;
let the people value life and not journey far.
Though there be boats and carriages, none to ride them;
though there be armor and weapons, none to array them.
Let the people return to knotting cords and using them.
Sweet be their food, fine their clothing,
secure their dwellings, joyful their customs.
Neighboring states gaze upon one another,
the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way—
yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

Chapter Eighty

The world, too, is but thus.
Viewing "few and small" through "few and small,"
viewing "mighty and great" through "mighty and great,"
viewing the world through the world—
man aligns with Heaven, Heaven with the Dao,
the Dao with spontaneity.
Where then is there any place one would not find fitting?

Extending this principle to the vastness of the four seas:
if the worthy and noble "secure their dwellings" while the base and unworthy "do not come,"
then the worthy and noble are settled;
if the base and unworthy "secure their dwellings" while the worthy and noble "do not go,"
then the base and unworthy are harmonized.

Turning inward to seek within the self:
if the ears and eyes "secure their dwellings" while the heart-mind "does not go,"
then the ears and eyes remain whole;
if the heart-mind "secures its dwelling" while the ears and eyes "do not come,"
then the heart-mind is rectified.

The one who "embraces the One"
embraces its unity without severing its non-unity,
thus "mysteriously uniting" with the One,
free from the affliction of grasping or rejecting.

Trustworthy words are not fine; fine words are not trustworthy.

The good do not dispute; those who dispute are not good.
The wise are not encyclopedic; the encyclopedic are not wise.
The sage does not accumulate—
the more they act for others, the more they possess;
the more they give to others, the more they have.

The Way of Heaven benefits without harming;
[while humans see gain, there must be loss.]
The Way of the sage acts without contending.

Chapter Eighty-One

To "act for others" with what one "has" is to leave others with "having" while oneself is diminished;
to "give to others" with one's "abundance" is to leave others with "abundance" while oneself is impoverished.
Who can fathom the "acting for others" of those who act without acting?
Or the "giving to others" of those who give without giving?

The Dao scatters across the world—how vast the world is, thus it "does not accumulate."
When the Dao accumulates within the self,
there arises "beauty," "disputation," and "erudition."
Once there is "beauty" and "disputation," augmented by "erudition,"
there has never been one who "does not contend."

Yet at the very edge of the Dao,
it is like a ladle of water to the great sea—
scooped and drunk, it is already exhausted.
Bowing one's head to "act," how could one know the raising of the head to "contend"?
Without asking about "benefit," benefit naturally comes to be—
how could one meet with "harm"?

Those who do not measure the boundless with the bounded are themselves boundless.
"Resting in the harmony of Heaven,"
what is there to "do," what to "give," and what exhaustion could there be?
