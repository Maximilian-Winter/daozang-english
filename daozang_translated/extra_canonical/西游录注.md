Here follows the translation:

The *Annotated Record of Western Travels* (Xiyou Lu Zhu), compiled by Yelü Chucai of the Yuan dynasty and annotated by Li Wentian of the Qing, states: At the beginning of the dynasty, the Grand Chancellor accompanied the western campaign, journeying fifty or sixty thousand *li*, and remained in the Western Regions for six or seven years. His *Record of Western Travels* recounts these events, a text rarely seen, and thus an abridgment is provided here.

In the spring of the *wuyin* year, the thirteenth year of the Great Ancestor of the Yuan, the Grand Chancellor set out from Yunzhong. The *Collection of the Serene Layman* contains a poem titled *"Passing Yunzhong: A Gift to Minister Li."* Arriving at the Tianshan Mountains, the *Book of Han: Treatise on the Western Regions* records: "The King of the Biluo state rules from Qiandang, east of the Tianshan." Jin Zhuo’s annotation to the *"Annals of Emperor Wu"* states: "The Tianshan lies near the Pulei state, over eight thousand *li* from Chang’an." Yan Shigu comments: "The Tianshan is the Qilian Mountains." The astronomer Qi Yunshi, in his *Essentials of the Western Frontier*, writes: "The mountains of Hami are the Tianshan. Three hundred *li* north of the mountains lies Barkol. The Liugu River lies northeast of the city, its source in the Tianshan, and its waters are used to irrigate the fields." Crossing the great desert...

The *Northern Frontier Prepared Responses* by Song scholar Cheng Dachang states: "The Great Desert refers to the vast expanse of shifting sands, appearing boundless and desolate. Later historians of the Han dynasty altered the term to *qi* (碛). *Qi* denotes accumulated sand—its meaning remains the same." The *Great Tang Records on the Western Regions* notes: "Six hundred *li* west of Qiuci lies a small *qi*, beyond which lies the state of Balūka." Crossing the desert, Qi Yunshi’s *Record of a Ten-Thousand-*Li* Journey* recounts: "Anxi Prefecture, formerly called Great Bay, was later reestablished as Anxi Prefecture and now renamed a prefectural state. Five *li* beyond its northern gate, one crosses a dry riverbed and enters the sandy wastes. The locals call it *Gobi*, the ancient *Han Sea*. The land is composed of sand and stone as if forged into skin by smelting."

Arriving at the imperial encampment—here referring to the Yuan Taizu’s traveling court at Kharakhorum, as described in Qiu Chuji’s *Record of a Western Journey*: "the emperor’s former *wuli duo*." The *Record of a Western Journey* states: "On the twenty-eighth day of the sixth lunar month in the *xinsi* year, we moored at *Woli Duo*, the Chinese term for a traveling palace." It was also called *Naiman Guoli Duo*, for after Taizu conquered the Naiman, he established his encampment here to facilitate western campaigns. The following year—the *jimao* year—marked the fourteenth year of Yuan Taizu’s reign. A grand western expedition was launched, passing through the Altay Mountains. Cheng Dachang’s *Northern Frontier Prepared Responses* records: "During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Ashina Turks of the Göktürks occupied the northern lands of the ancient Xiongnu and dwelled on the southern slopes of the Altay Mountains." According to the *Collected Works of Master Zhanran*, Volume One contains the poem *"Passing the Altay Mountains in the Style of Another’s Rhyme."* The *Geographical Explanation of the Western Regions* states: "The Bogda Mountains of Urumqi rise in three peaks, soaring into the clouds. Midway up the slopes lies a pool, over ten *li* in circumference, called *Haizi* by the locals. To the south of the mountains are the so-called Seven *Daban*, which correspond to this location." As noted in the *Old唐书*: "From Jiaohe County in Xizhou, traveling north through Liugu Valley, crossing Jinsha Ridge, one reaches the city of the Beiting Protectorate." Further, Du Fu’s poetic annotations record: "From Jiaohe, traveling eighty *li* north to Longquan Inn, then entering the valley for one hundred thirty *li*, passing through Liugu Valley, crossing Taisha Ridge, and after one hundred sixty *li*, passing the Han garrison at Shihui, one arrives at the Beiting Protectorate." Today, Urumqi is the former seat of the Tang Beiting Protectorate, and Turpan the ancient seat of Xizhou. By comparing the distances between them, this *Daban* is the so-called Jinsha Ridge. Near the ridge lies a slope where the sand is fine and loose, causing horses’ hooves to slip—hence the names *Jinsha* ("Golden Sand") and *Taisha* ("Platform Sand"). The *Imperial Western Regions Atlas* states: "The present-day Altan corresponds to the ancient Altay Mountains. The *Old唐书* records that the Ashina Turks dwelled on the southern slopes of the Altay, and Pei Luo crossed west beyond the Altay—this confirms it." At that time, it was midsummer, yet snow congealed and ice accumulated, requiring the cutting of ice to forge a path.

Amidst towering pines and cypresses, flowers and grasses fill the valleys. West of the Altay Mountains, all waters flow westward into the sea. As Liu Qi’s *Record of a Northern Mission* states: "Leaving the northern frontier and traveling northwest, the land gradually rises, bordering the Xia state. For the first seven or eight thousand *li*, east of the mountains, all waters flow east; west of the mountains, all waters flow west, as the land gradually descends."

Qi Yunshi’s *Essentials of the Western Frontier* notes: "The rivers of Xinjiang diverge in their courses. Those of the southern route all flow east, originating from the southern and northern mountains—such as the Ulan Usu of Kashgar, the Jade River of Yarkand, the Karakash and Yurungkash of Khotan, the Hushqi of Ush, the Hunbash of Aksu, the Weigan of Kuqa, and the Kaidu of Karashahr—all converging eastward in Lop Nur of Turpan. All meltwater from the snows of the southern and northern mountains flows into it. Accumulating and pooling underground, it forms the ancient Puchang Sea.

The waters of the northern route, such as the various rivers of Ili, mostly flow west; those of the Irtysh in Tacheng mostly flow east; the Manas River of Urumqi mostly flows north. Some empty into lakes, some traverse reed marshes, some vanish into the sands, and many are fed by converging meltwater."

To its south lies the Uighur city.

From the *Supplementary Records of the Western Regions in the Yuan History*: "The land of the Uighurs. In the twentieth year of the Zhiyuan era, four postal stations and a paper-currency treasury were established in Uighur territory."

From the *Ming Shifa Lu*: "Huozhou, known in the Yuan as Uighur. Seventy *li* to the east lies Liuchen City, and one hundred *li* to its west lies Turpan, which was the seat of the ancient Kingdom of Gaochang."

According to the *Liao History: Military Defense Records*: "Among the subject states’ armies were the Uighurs, the Ganzhou Uighurs, the Shazhou Uighurs, and the Hezhou Uighurs." This refers to the city of the Hezhou Uighurs.

Hong Hao’s *Records of Songmo* states: "The Uighurs of Ganzhou, Liangzhou, Guazhou, and Shazhou all once had tribal encampments. Only those dwelling beyond the four commanderies established their own states, each with its own ruler." Another name for this place is *Shiba*.

The *Record of a Western Mission* states: "Proceeding northwest along the Longgu River, one reaches Bieshibali to the south after nearly five hundred *li*."

From the *Supplementary Records of the Western Regions in the Yuan History*: "Bieshibali. In the fifteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, Basachali was granted a tiger tally to oversee the postal and military stations of the Uighur city of Bieshibali. In the seventeenth year, the garrison commander Qi Gongzhi was stationed there. In the eighteenth year, at the request of Prince Ajiji, thirty new stations were established from Taihe Ridge to Bieshibali. In the twentieth year, the Pacification Commission of Bieshibali, Hezhou, and other regions was established. In the twenty-third year, one thousand newly surrendered imperial guardsmen were sent to garrison and cultivate Bieshibali, where a marshal’s headquarters was established."

The *Ming History: Western Regions Annals* states: "Bieshibali was a great state of the Western Regions. To its south lay Khotan, to its west Samarkand, to its east Huozhou, and to its north the Oirats. During the Yuan, the emperor considered establishing a pacification commission there."

The *Record of Western Travels* refers to it as "Biesimada City."

Ouyang Xuan’s *Genealogy of the Gao Clan of Gaochang* states: "Beiting is today’s Bieshibali City."

A Tang stele remains there. The *Record of Western Travels* states: "The Duan Prefecture of Beiting. In the third year of the Jinglong era, Yang He, the Grand Protector, governed with virtue, and two stone inscriptions from the Longxing West Temple remain, their merit and virtue still radiant. The temple houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures, and many frontier cities of the Tang still endure."

From the *Huai Xi Miscellany*: "Tenage’er was the Tang’s Jinman County, where fragments of a stele still stand."

The *Western Regions: A Topographical Account* states: "Dinggu Mountain in Kuqa lies north of the city. An ancient temple stands there, with many Tang steles, and a pagoda towering several dozen *zhang* in height."

The *Records of the Waterways of the Western Regions* states: "The four sources of Barkol Lake: the southeastern source is called Zhaomoduo Sha Wulumuqi, and its administrative seat is Gongning City. To the city’s south lies the Alagui Mountains, and to its east the Bogda Mountains. North of the mountains lies Fukang County. Traveling east along the mountains for one hundred ninety *li*, one reaches the Tang’s Shapozhen, the Mohe City where Ashina Helu resided. Fifty *li* farther east lies Jimusa, the pagoda city of the Western Turk Khaganate, which in the Tang was Jinman County of Tingzhou, later renamed Houting County—the seat of the Beiting Protectorate. The Yuan established the Beiting Marshal Headquarters in Bieshibali, also governing from this site. The old city lies over twenty *li* north of today’s Baohui City, in a place called Hubaozi. The ruined city contains a fragmentary stele of the Tang’s Jinman County, the stone split in two, each piece eight *cun* tall and six *cun* wide—one with seven lines of text, the other with six."

This is the so-called Hanhai Army.

In Liu Yu’s *Record of the Western Mission* from the Yuan, it is written: “The land of the Hanhai is exceedingly cold and high; even in the height of summer, the snow does not melt.” What is now called the Hanhai was in ancient times Mount Jinshan. The *Treatise on Geography* in the *Old Book of Tang* states: “The Beiting Grand Protectorate was originally Tingzhou. In the fourteenth year of the Zhenguan era, Gaochang was pacified. The Hanhai Army was established, and in the second year of the Chang’an era, it was formally established.” The Hanhai lies several hundred *li* from the city. The *Exegesis of Western Regions’ Geography* says: “From Hami east to Anxi Prefecture and west to Turpan, there are several hundred *li* of sandy wastes, devoid of water and grass, barren lands—these are called the Hanhai, now known as the Gobi.” Within this sea are islets, upon which lie the molted feathers of birds that alight there.

The *Records of the Grand Historian: Account of the Xiongnu* states: “General Huo Qubing was enfeoffed at Mount Langjuxu, performed the *chan* rites at Guyuan, and returned after reaching the Hanhai.” Ru Chun notes: “The Hanhai is the name of the Northern Sea.” Zhang Shoujie’s *Correct Meanings* says: “According to records, the Hanhai is the name of a great sea, where flocks of birds shed their feathers and nest upon the stones, hence its name.” Li Guangting’s *Illustrated Survey of the Western Regions* remarks: “According to Yelü Chucai’s *Record of the Western Journey*: ‘In the year *wuchen*, we reached the imperial encampment and arrived at what was Tang’s Gaochang,’ and so on—this identifies present-day Jimusa as the Hanhai, which differs from Liu Yu’s *Record of the Western Mission*. Moreover, his reference to Pulei Sea is also imprecise.”

The *Exegesis of Western Regions’ Geography* states: “Balikun is called Huining City. There is a lake there, the ancient Pulei Sea, also called Posihai, commonly known as the Haizi. It lies north of the city beneath the sandy mountains. It stretches over a hundred *li* from east to west, and its opposite shore spans several tens of *li*.” The *Book of Later Han* records Zhang Dang’s account of the Huyan King, who frequently moved between Pulei and Qinhai. The *Yuanhe Era Geography* notes that north of Nazhi County in Yizhou, one reaches Pulei Sea. Tang’s Yizhou is today’s Hami, which lies near Balikun, and Balikun was also the territory of the Han-era Pulei Kingdom. Thus, this lake is undoubtedly the Pulei Sea.

Two hundred *li* west of the city lies Luntai County.

The *New Tang History: Treatise on Geography* records: “From Yancheng in Tingzhou west to Luntai County is a total of three hundred and twenty *li*.” The *Record of Western Travels* states: “In the great city of Biesima, several hundred *li* to its east lies a prefecture called Xiliang. Over three hundred *li* to its west lies a county called Luntai.” The Master inquired, “How many stages must one travel to reach the imperial encampment?” All replied, “Proceeding southwest for over ten thousand *li*, one arrives.” A Tang stele stands there. The *Records of Western Regions’ Waterways* also discusses this.

Five hundred *li* south of the city lies Hezhou. The *History of Yuan: Biography of Yelü Xiliang* states: “From Ku’er, one reaches Hala Huozhou.” The *History of Yuan: Appendix on Northwestern Lands* records “Hela Huo” under “Alimali.” This is Tang’s Gaochang. The *History of Liao: Treatise on Military Guards* notes: “The subject-state army includes Gaochang.” The *History of Ming* records: “Huozhou’s terrain is mountainous, its rocks crimson as fire, hence its name. East of Huozhou lies a ruined city, the former capital of the Gaochang Kingdom, where the Han-era Wuji Colonel was stationed. To its northwest lies Beshbaliq, later annexed by Turpan.” It is also called Yizhou. The *Collection of Master Zhanran: Twelve Nostalgic Poems* contains the line: “Crossing the Gobi west of Yizhou.” The annotation explains: “Northwest of Yizhou lies the Gobi; Yizhou is also called Xizhou.” The *Western Regions’ Exegesis of Geography* states: “The *Yuanhe Era Geography* records that north of Nazhi County in Yizhou, one reaches Pulei Sea. Tang’s Yizhou is today’s Hami.”

Three to four thousand *li* west of Gaochang lies Wuduan City, which was Tang’s Yutian Kingdom. The *History of Yuan: Appendix on Northwestern Lands* renders it as “Hutan,” while the *Biography of Hesimaile* and the *Biography of Bayan Badulu* both write it as “Woduan.” The *Annals of Emperor Xianzong* records it as “Kuoduan”—all phonetic variations of the characters for “Wuduan.” Today it is called “Hotan.” The *History of Ming* writes it as “Aduan” and also retains the ancient name “Yutian,” though these are not two separate places. The *Western Regions’ Exegesis of Geography* explains: “Yarkand was the land of the Han-era Shache Kingdom. After the Tang, it was incorporated into Yutian, also called Hotan. The Han-era Yutian Kingdom was where the Tang established the Yutian Protectorate. The Uyghurs call the Han people ‘Heitai,’ and Hotan is a corruption of ‘Heitai.’ Legend holds that the Han general Ren Shang abandoned his troops there.”

The river yields black-and-white jade.

The *Essentials of the Western Frontier* states: "In the mountains of Yarkand, there is the Mierdi Mountain, over two hundred *li* south of the city, which produces jade. There is the Ma’erhuluke Mountain, over four hundred *li* southwest of the city, which also produces jade. Another great mountain lies southwest of Yarkand, connected to Mierdi Mountain. The Uyghurs call it Tashidabahan—likely the so-called Congling. The waters include the Jade River, which flows from Mierdi Mountain and branches southward into Hotan. Within Hotan’s borders, a range of snow-capped mountains gives rise to the Karakash River, the Yulongkash River, and the Halangguitake River, all rich in jade and vital for irrigation."

Beyond the Gobi Desert for over a thousand *li* lies the city of Bula. The *Supplementary Records of the Northwest* renders it as "Pula." The *Biography of Yelü Xiliang* states: "They arrived at Bula City." Li Guangting’s *Illustrated Survey of the Western Regions* notes: "Bula City is a phonetic evolution of ‘Bolao City’ from the *Record of a Western Envoy*. South of the city lies the Yin Mountains, also called the Pine Tree Ridge. The mountaintop holds a lake. Today’s Sailimu Lake lies amid four mountains—this is the lake."

South of Bula stretch the Yin Mountains, a thousand *li* east to west and two hundred *li* north to south. The *Record of a Western Journey* recounts: "At first, north of the Shatuo, we gazed southward at the horizon, where it appeared like silver mist. Asking those beside me, none knew. The master said, ‘It is likely the Yin Mountains.’ The next day, crossing the Shatuo, we met woodcutters and asked again—all confirmed it." Volume One of *The Collected Works of the Serene Scholar* contains *Six Poems Matching Rhymes While Crossing the Yin Mountains*.

Atop the mountains lies a lake, seventy or eighty *li* in circumference. The *Essentials of the Western Frontier* states: "Among Ili’s waters is Sailimu Lake, over two hundred *li* northeast of the city, separated by mountains. While all waters within the region flow into the Ili River, Sailimu Lake alone does not." The *Western Regions’ Exegesis of Geography* records: "Sailimu Lake lies over two hundred *li* northeast of Ili City, east of the Tarqi Ridge. To its north is a valley called Borotal."

To the south of the lake, the land is entirely covered with *linqin* trees, their canopies dense and lush, blocking out the sunlight. Exiting the Yin Mountains, one reaches the city of Alima. *The Record of the Western Mission* states: "Exiting the pass, one arrives at the city of Alimali, where streams crisscross the markets." *The Record of the Western Mission* reads "Exiting the pass to Alimali City"—it should be "Exiting the pass to Alima City," with an extraneous *li* character. This is the "Alima City" of *The Collected Works of the Serene Scholar*, not the "Alimali" of *Supplementary Records of the Northwest*. The Westerners call *linqin* "Alima," and as the orchards encircle the city, it takes its name from them. There are eight or nine dependent towns and villages. *The Zhiyuan Translation of Languages* states: "In Mongolian, 'pear' is called *Alima*." The region abounds in grapes and pears. The five grains are sown just as in the Central Plains.

Further west flows a great river called Yilie. Liu Qi’s *Record of the Northern Mission* recounts: "In the twelfth month of the fourth year of the Xingding era, we departed the northern frontier and traveled through increasingly elevated terrain. After seven or eight thousand *li*, and then another four or five thousand *li*, the land grew exceedingly warm, passing over a hundred cities, none bearing Han names. After nearly ten thousand *li*, we reached the Yili City of the Uyghur kingdom, the capital of the Uyghur king." The name "Yili" is a phonetic shift from "Yilie," likely derived from the Yilie River. *The Record of the Western Journey* states: "Following the south of Heavenly Lake, descending past Alima City, and traveling west for four days, one reaches Dalasumein. *Mein* means 'river.'" Xu Song’s postscript notes: "Alima City corresponds to the present-day Western Alimatu River, northeast of Gongchen City, emerging from the Taleqi Mountain Pass and flowing southwest to the Alimatu River, barely a hundred *li* away. Traveling west for four days to Dalasumein, this is the present-day Ili River. Calculating the four days’ journey westward, it should lie west of the present-day Chalin Ford." As for the Yilie River, Li Guangting states: "It likely refers to the present-day Chahanwusu River west of Zhandé City, subsumed under the general name of the Ili." *The Western Regions’ Exegesis of Geography* records: "The Ili River lies roughly one *li* south of Ili City, its source in the Kax and Kongjisi Rivers. Its mighty currents run deep and wide, gathering all waters within the region. Passing south of the city, it turns northwest, flowing over seven hundred *li* before entering Kazakh territory, where it vanishes into the sands."

According to *The Old Book of Tang*: "During the Zhenguan era, the Western Turkic Khaganate divided its tribes into two, with the Yilie River as the boundary. In the second year of the Xianqing era, Su Dingfang served as the Grand Military Commissioner of the Yili Circuit and campaigned against the Western Turks." The "Yili" mentioned here is the present-day Ili, named after the river. "Li" and "li" share the same name, while "lie" is phonetically similar. To its west lies the city of Husisuwoluoduo, the capital of the Western Liao. Chen Shiyuan’s *Translated Terms in Various Histories* explains: "*Wo’erduo* means 'tent palace' in Chinese. *The History of Liao* refers to it as *woluoduo*, a phonetic variation." *The Record of the Western Mission* states: "Passing between the six *tu* and two mountains, the land levels out with a dense populace, crisscrossed by irrigation channels, and strewn with old ramparts and walls. Upon inquiry, we learned this was the former residence of the Khitans. The distance from here to Karakorum is nearly fifteen thousand *li*." *The Veritable Records of the Tianzuo Era in The History of Liao* records: "Yelü Dashi established a capital city called Husisuwoluoduo." Furthermore, *The History of Liao’s Military Defense* mentions: "The vassal armies include the Humusi Mountain tribes." *Humusi* is the same as the "Husi" in *The Veritable Records*. Additionally, *The Table of Tribes and Clans* notes that in the second year of the Tianzan era of Emperor Taizu of Liao, the Humusi Mountain tribes were defeated. *The Table of Various Tribes* also lists the Humusi tribe. All these refer to the "Husi" in this record, later called *wo’erduo* after Yelü Dashi established his capital. *The History of Liao’s Administrative Divisions* states: "Where the ruler resides is called a *woluoduo*." *The History of Jin’s Official System* explains: "*Woliduo* is the place where government affairs are conducted." The city had several dozen dependent towns.

Further west several hundred *li* lies Talas City. *The Record of a Western Envoy* states: "On the twenty-eighth day, we passed Talasi Monastery." According to *The Record of a Western Journey*, there is "Darasu-mo'nian." The original annotation reads: "Mo'nian means river." Thus, "Talas" is the homophonic equivalent of "Darasu." This city takes its name from the river, whose upper reaches are already called the Darasu River. In this record, it is referred to as the Yili River, located east of the Central Prefecture of the Western Liao River. Flowing west for several hundred *li*, the river encircles this city, which is the Talas City in this record and the Talasi Monastery passed by Liu Yu. Further southwest over four hundred *li* lies Khujand City. *The Record of a Western Envoy* states: "On the fourth day, we crossed the Khujand River, where the ferryboats resembled official shoes. The locals said: ‘The river’s source lies in the great southern mountains, a land rich in jade.’ It is likely the Kunlun Mountains."

Eight Cities—Bapu, *The Supplementary Record of Northwestern Regions in the History of the Yuan* renders this as "Babu," which is homophonous with "Bapu" in this record but written differently. Kesan City, *The Supplementary Record* writes it as "Kesan," an alternate form of "Kesan" in this record. *The Biography of Hesimaili* renders it as "Kesan City." Balan City. *Record of Western Travels* states: "In the renwu year, during the first month of spring, the balan trees first bloomed, resembling small peach blossoms. By autumn, their fruits were harvested and eaten, tasting like walnuts." *Zhanran’s Collected Records of Western Travels in Verse* reads: "Having tasted balan without regard for price, / Brewing grape wine without paying tribute to officials." Other poems mentioning balan and grapes are too numerous to list. Khujand abounds in pomegranates, each as large as a chess piece, sweet with a slight sourness. Squeezing three to five yields a bowlful of juice, a supreme delight for the thirsty.

Khujand is written as "Huzhan" in *The Supplementary Record of Northwestern Regions in the History of the Yuan* and as "Huozhan" in *The History of the Ming’s Western Regions*. *The Biography of Xue Talahai* in *The History of the Yuan* records campaigns against the states of Huhuchan, which correspond to the lands of Khujand. Another passage in *The History of the Yuan*, *The Biography of Guo Baoyu*, states: "He pacified Bieshibali, Bieshilan, and other cities, then advanced to the Khujand River." From this biography, we know that "Khujand" and "Khujand" are homophonous, the city having taken its name from the river. Balan City is surrounded by balan orchards, hence its name. Its flowers resemble apricot blossoms but are slightly paler, and its leaves are like peach leaves but somewhat smaller. It blooms in winter and bears fruit abundantly in summer.

In Bapu, the largest watermelons weigh fifty *jin*. *Records of Songmo* states: "The watermelon is shaped like a flat gourd but round, its rind a deep green that turns yellow after a year. Its flesh resembles that of a sweet melon, filled with juice, and is especially cooling." Ming-dynasty scholar Zhang Yi’s *Qingshang Lu* quotes Yelü Chucai’s *Record of Western Travels*: "In Bapu, the largest watermelons weigh fifty *jin* and can hold a fox." The phrase "can hold a fox" is absent here, having been excised by *Laoxue Conglu*. A long-eared donkey can carry only two at a time.

Five hundred *li* northwest of Khujand lies the city of Edarala. *The Basic Annals of the Yuan History* records: "In the fourteenth year, Edarala City was taken," which corresponds to the homophonic transcription of "Edarala" in this text. *The Supplementary Record of Northwestern Regions* writes it as "Wutilar’er." Another entry in *The Basic Annals* states: "In the fifteenth year, in autumn, the city of Wotuoluo’er was attacked and captured," which is phonetically similar. The discrepancy likely arises from drawing on different sources, leading to repetition. Moreover, the western regions were fierce and unruly; it is not impossible that the city was retaken after rebellion, hence the two campaigns.

Li Guangting’s *Illustrated Survey of the Western Regions* notes: "When Qiuci submitted to the Yuan, it became Bieshibali, and its western border city was called Kuxian, which is the homophonic equivalent of today’s ‘Kuche.’ *The Biography of Yelü Xiliang* in *The History of the Yuan* records campaigns reaching Hunbasheng City. Today, south of Aksu, there is a Hunbashi Village. When Emperor Shizu was recalled from the lands of the Two Kings, he passed through Kuxian City to Hala Huozhou, then to Yizhou, crossing the great desert to return—this is also called Khujand." Zheng Wen’s *Record of Western Travels* states: "Five hundred *li* northwest of Khujand lies Edarala City." All refer to the same place. It governs over a dozen dependent cities.

This city’s chieftains once killed several imperial envoys and over a hundred merchants, seizing all their goods and wealth. The western campaign arose from this. *The Basic Annals of the Yuan History* states: "In the summer of the fourteenth year of Taizu’s reign, the sixth month, the Western Regions killed envoys. The Emperor personally led the army to campaign, taking Edarala City and capturing its chieftain, Hajji Erketü." Over a thousand *li* west of Edarala lies a great city called Xunsiqan. *Record of the Western Mission* says: "Passing Xunsiqan, the city is vast and its people numerous." *The Basic Annals of Taizu in the Yuan History* states: "In the fifteenth year, Xunsiqan City was taken." It also says: "In the sixteenth year, Xiemisigan City was attacked." Now, it is noted that after Taizu took this city, it later rebelled, hence the second attack in the sixteenth year. "Xiemisigan" is "Xunsiqan." *Supplementary Records of the Northwest* renders it as "Samarqand." *The Biography of Anzhuni in the Yuan History* says: "Taizu campaigned west to Xunsiqan." *The Biography of Guo Baoyu* says: "He took Xunsiqan City." It also says: "Leading troops to occupy Xunsiqan, he entered the Iron Gate and encamped at the Great Snow Mountains." *The Biography of Yelü Ahai* says: "He took Xunsiqan and other cities." *Ming Shifalu* states: "Samarqand, the ancient land of the Xiuxian Kingdom, lies west of Xuandu Mountain. The Tang established the Xiuxian Supervisory Prefecture there, appointing its five *dudu*. During the Yuan, the imperial son-in-law Temür ruled the land. To the east lay Yang’ershalu Haiya Sailanda Shigan, and to the west, cities such as Kesh and Dielimi, all subject to it."

Samarqand, as the Westerners call it, means "fertile," named for its rich and abundant land. *The Journey to the West* states: "Samarqand, a city ten thousand *li* away, is the finest place in the Uighur realm." Du Huan’s *Record of Travels* says: "Samojian is fertile, its people wealthy, and its land small. There is a sacred shrine called Bazhu." From *Zhanran’s Collection: Twelve Poems of Nostalgia*: "Moved by grace to bear the imperial decree, I entrusted my message to Xunsi." The annotation reads: "Xunsiqian is a city in the Western Regions. The Westerners say: ‘Xunsi means fertile; qian means city.’ Together, it is called the Fertile City." It is exceedingly prosperous. They use gold and copper coins without holes or rims. For dozens of *li* around the city lie gardens and groves, with flowing canals and gushing springs, square ponds and round pools, flowers and trees stretching endlessly—truly a splendid sight. Their melons grow as large as a horse’s head. The land yields no millet, glutinous rice, or soybeans, and rain is absent even in midsummer. Wine is brewed from grapes. Though mulberry trees grow, they do not raise silkworms, and all wear *qushu* clothing. From *Zhanran’s Collection*, Volume 7, *Two Playful Poems*: "A *qushun* robe, light and trimmed in teal, / New grape wine swirls in goose-yellow hues." Volume 5, *Poem on Begging for a Fan*: "A *qushun* roundly cut like a white jade plate, / The recluse himself trims the pale bamboo." *The Yuan History: Treatise on Carriages and Attire* states: "*Zhisun*, in Chinese, means ‘single-color attire.’ It was bestowed upon meritorious nobles, high ministers, and close attendants, and even musicians and diviners were granted such robes, though the quality varied. All were called *zhisun*." White is considered an auspicious color, while blue is worn for mourning, so all dress in white. Chen Cheng’s *Record of an Embassy to the Western Regions* says: "The ruler of Herat wraps his head in white cloth and braids his hair into a queue. Men shave their heads and bind them with white cloth. Women cover their heads with white cloth."

Six or seven hundred *li* west of Samarkand lies the city of Bukhara, where the land yields even greater abundance and towns are somewhat more numerous. *The Yuan History: Annals of Taizu* records: "In the fifteenth year, Bukhara was taken." *The Biography of Yelü Ahai* states: "Bukhara was subdued." *Supplementary Records of the Northwest* lists "Bukhara" beneath "Termedh." This appears to be the same "Bukhara" mentioned in the *Annals*. *Ming Shifa Record* says: "Bukhār lies seven hundred *li* west of Samarkand. Calculating by distance, since Samarkand is Samarkand, then Bukhār must be Bukhara." *The Biography of Yelü Ahai* further notes: "Following the Emperor in his western campaign, he captured cities such as Bukhara and Samarkand." In volume five of *The Collected Works of Zhanran*, the seventh poem of *Poems Presented to Marshal Pucha* reads: "Idly riding a lean horse past Bukhara, / Once more I arrive at the home of the Prefect of Xiyang." Volume six also contains *Dreaming of the Old Man of Ten Thousand Pines in Bukhara*. Samarkand was the capital of the Karluk tribe ruled by the Sogdians. *Record of a Northern Mission* states: "There are Muslim Karluks who are cruel by nature. They must slaughter animals with their own hands before eating, and even during fasts, they indulge in wine and dried meat without restraint." *Journey to the West* records: "Upon reaching the city of Almalik, the king of the Pusuman came to welcome them, and they lodged in the Western Garden." "Pusuman" and "Muslim Karluk" are both phonetic variations of "Karluk." Furthermore, according to *The Liao History: Table of Various Tribes*, there was a Puswan tribe, and *The Jin History* lists "Pusuwo" among the twelve pastoral offices. Here, they are referred to as the "Karluk tribe," suggesting they belong to the same group. In the annotations to *One Hundred Rhymes of Nostalgia* in volume twelve of *The Collected Works of Zhanran*, it is written: "Dashi Linya, a minister of the Liao, led his people into exile. In less than twenty years, he conquered dozens of Western Regions states, spanning tens of thousands of *li*. His lineage endured for several generations over a hundred years, and they greatly valued civil education."

The Western Regions still revere him to this day, posthumously styling him "Virtuous Ancestor." In the annotations to *Spring Outing by the River* in volume five, it is written: "Near Samarkand lies the Suli Tan of the Western Regions, where the former palace still stands." The cities of Bukhara, Khujand, and Otrar were all subject to it. *An Illustrated Survey of the Western Regions* states: "According to *The Annals of Yuan Taizu*, in the fourteenth year (jimao, 1219), the Western Regions killed envoys. The Emperor personally led a campaign and took Otrar. Otrar is present-day Aksu. The Yeshiding Stone River is the Bide'er River of Wushi." West of Bukhara, a great river flows into the sea. *The Annals of Taizu* records: "In the fifteenth year, summer, fifth month, the imperial encampment halted by the Yeshiding Stone River." However, at that time, the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand had already been taken, so this great river is not the Yeshiding Stone River but rather the present-day Amu Darya. This is known from *The Secret History of the Mongols* and *The Record of a Journey to the West*. To its west lies the city of Urgench. *The Annals of the Yuan History* states: "In the autumn of the sixteenth year, the imperial sons Jochi, Chagatai, and Ögedei divided their forces to attack and capture the cities of Urgench and others." "Urgench" is a homophonic rendering of the three characters "Yulongjie." In Mongolian, "official" is called *chi*, hence the name "Yulongjiechi." *The Secret History of the Mongols* says: "Crossing the Amu Darya, they encamped below the city of Ürünggechi." "Ürüngge" is even closer in sound to "Yuligan." *The Biography of Hesumaili* in *The Yuan History* renders it as "the land of Yuelianjiechi." *The Biography of Yelü Xiliang* records: "In the fifth month, they traveled west to Beilesali. In the sixth month, they reached Huanzhasun. Proceeding another nine hundred *li* west, they arrived at Yelikan City. Later, they returned with the two princes to Bula City." Note: Beilesali is Bula City. Huanzhasun is a phonetic shift of "Husi," the capital of the Western Liao. "Nine hundred *li* to Yelikan City" is a phonetic variation of "Yulongjie," which is Urgench, and also a homophonic rendering of the three characters "Yuligan." "Returning to Bula City" is again Beilesali. The translations were likely done by a single person, yet inconsistencies arose between earlier and later passages, and the compilers of the biographies were unfamiliar with Mongolian, leaving readers bewildered.

The Suli Tan Empress Dowager resided there. The region was even more prosperous than Bukhara. This empress dowager was likely the wife of Zhilugu, for at that time, the Naiman usurped Zhilugu’s kingdom and honored his consort as the Empress Dowager. Further west, along the great river, lies the city of Ban. *The Annals of the Yuan History* records: "In the sixteenth year (xinsi, 1221), summer, fourth month, the imperial encampment halted at the Iron Gate Pass. In autumn, the Emperor attacked the cities of Banlehe and others." *The Biography of Baicha Khan* states: "Baicha Khan was a native of Banlehe in the Western Regions. Initially, Baicha Khan was born in the River Central region. That night, the sky was clear and serene, the moon bright as day. In the Western Regions, white is called *baicha*, hence his name." Note: River Central refers to Samarkand; Banlehe is Ban City. Further west lies the Brick City. *The Record of a Journey to the West* says: "West of the southern bank of the Iron Gate lies a mountain stronghold called Tuanbala, its terrain perilously steep." This "Brick City" is a phonetic shift of "Tuan City." Thus, *The Record* states: "From there, traveling thirty *li* southeast, they passed Banli City." Since this city lies west of Banli, it is clear that "Brick City" corresponds to "Tuanbala" in *The Record*. *The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions* states: "Traveling southwest from the country of Jieshuangna for over two hundred *li*, one enters the mountains. The mountain paths are rugged, the stream crossings treacherous, with few signs of human habitation and scarce water and grass. Proceeding three hundred *li* southeast through the mountains, one enters the Iron Gate. The Iron Gate is flanked by mountains, their cliffs sheer and towering. Though a narrow path exists, it is perilous and obstructed. The stone walls on either side are iron-colored, and the gate is reinforced with iron bolts and hung with many iron bells. Due to its impregnability, it is so named. Exiting the Iron Gate, one reaches the country of Duhuoluo," and so on. This "Brick City" was likely the former territory of the Tang-era Tuhuoluo kingdom.

From here, proceeding west leads directly to the Black Indian City. The region also has its own script. Liu Qi’s *Record of a Northern Mission* states: "There are the Indu Huihe, dark-skinned and honest. Their written contracts and laws are all in the Huihe script, written with reed pens. Their language is unintelligible to the Chinese." *Record of a Western Mission* says: "The country of Yindu is closest to China, with a population of twelve million households. It is the Han-era Shendu." Giulio Aleni’s *Chronicles of the World Beyond the Administrative Regions* states: "Southwest of China lies India, the Five Indias of Tianzhu, situated along the Indus River." *The History of the Han: Treatise on the Western Regions* records: "The state of Wulei borders Yundu to the north." Yan Shigu notes: "Yundu is Shendu or Tiandu. These are all the same name, differing only in pronunciation." Minister Zhao Shaonan observes: "Tiandu is Tianzhu. The Tianzhu of *The History of the Later Han* corresponds to the Yundu of this *Treatise*, and later generations also call it the country of India." Its script and pronunciation differ from those of the Buddhist lands.

The land abounds with Buddhist statues. *The Western Journey Record* states: "Qishimi to the west is where the robe and bowl of Śākyamuni were transmitted." *Records Heard in Songmo* notes: "The Uyghurs revere Buddhism most devoutly. They gather in a hall, sculpting Buddha images within. For every fast, they must slaughter sheep. When drunk, they dip their fingers in blood to anoint the Buddha’s mouth, or lift its feet to their lips, calling this ‘intimate reverence.’ When reciting scriptures, they don robes and chant in the language of Western India."

*The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions* records: The state of Kashmir, formerly miswritten as "Chubin." They do not slaughter cattle or sheep but drink their milk. The locals have never seen snow. Wheat ripens twice a year. In midsummer, tin vessels placed in the sand soon melt. Horse dung falling to the ground boils and bubbles. Moonlight shines as brightly as summer sunlight. To its south flows a great river, cold as ice, its torrents fierce and swift, emptying into the Southern Sea.

*The New Tang History: Treatise on Geography* states: "Five small states lie on the western frontier of India, extending to the state of Tifengri. Within its borders flows the great river Maitrā, also called the Sindhu, which rises from the northern Mount Bökün, flows west to Tifengri, then north into the sea."

*Chronicles of the World Beyond the Administrative Regions* says: "In Eastern India flows a great river named the Ganges. The people believe that bathing in its waters washes away all past misdeeds."

The land yields abundant sugarcane, from which they extract juice to brew wine and refine sugar. Traveling northwest from India, one reaches the state of Kefucha.

*The History of the Yuan: Biography of Guo Baoyu* records: "In the year xinsi, the Sultan of Kefucha conquered the state of Naiman, led his troops to occupy Samarkand, and upon hearing of the Emperor’s approach, abandoned the city and fled south into the Iron Gate Pass, stationing his forces on the Great Snow Mountain. Baoyu pursued them, and they fled further into India."

*The Old Tang History: Traditions of the Western Rong* states: "The state of Persia borders the state of Tuhuoluo and Kang to the east, and to the north lies the Kesa tribe of the Turks."

Note: The so-called Kesa is likely the modern Russian Cossack region, corresponding to the Kefucha of this record. For thousands of *li*, the land is a vast plain without hills or mounds, and no cities or towns are established.

*Chronicles of the World Beyond the Administrative Regions* states: "At the northwesternmost reaches of Asia lies a great state called Muscovy, stretching fifteen thousand *li* from east to west and eight thousand *li* from north to south, divided into sixteen provinces. The Volga River is the largest, with eighty tributaries, all converging as its estuaries, and over seventy mouths empty into the Northern Arctic Sea."

*The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions* records: "Traveling fifteen or sixteen hundred *li* southwest from Sindhu, one reaches the state of Aduobachiluo, which spans over five thousand *li* in circumference. From Aduobachiluo, traveling seven hundred *li* north, one reaches the state of Biduoshiluo, within the borders of Western India, spanning over three thousand *li* in circumference. From there, traveling three hundred *li* northeast, one reaches the state of Aducha, also within Western India, spanning two thousand four or five hundred *li* in circumference. Its capital city measures over twenty *li* in circumference, with no great ruler but subject to the state of Sindhu. From there, traveling nine hundred *li* northeast, one reaches the state of Falana, spanning over four thousand *li* in circumference. Continuing northwest, crossing great mountains, fording broad rivers, passing through small towns and villages for over two thousand *li*, one leaves the borders of India and arrives at the state of Caojuzha."

The people raise many sheep and horses and ferment honey for wine. In this land, days are long and nights short; by the time a sheep’s shoulder is roasted, the sun has risen again. This precisely matches the account of the state of Guliwo in the *Tang History*.

*The History of the Yuan: Biography of Tutuga* records: "Qincha is over thirty thousand *li* from China. In summer, the nights are extremely short, and the sun sets only briefly before rising again."

*The Treatise on Geography: Supplementary Records of the Northwest* states: "Qiongelie is named after its river and is a vassal of Jili. Jisi is over twenty-five thousand *li* from the Great Capital. Days are long and nights short; when the sun sets, a roasted sheep’s rib is done, and dawn has already broken in the east." This is the state of Guliwo recorded in the *Tang History*.

*The New Tang History: Treatise on Geography* states: "On the north bank of the Xiane River lies the city of Fugui. Traveling directly north and slightly east for fifteen hundred *li*, passing through snow mountains, pine and birch forests, and various springs and lakes, one reaches Guliwo. Thirteen days’ journey further west lies the Dubo tribe. Six or seven days north of that lies the Jiankun tribe, where the Laoshān Mountains and the Jian River are found. North of the Guliwo and Dubo tribes lies a small sea, which can be crossed in eight days by horse when the ice is solid. North of the sea stand many great mountains. The people there are tall and imposing, with customs similar to those of Guliwo—days are long and nights short."

*The New Tang History: Traditions of the Uyghurs* records: "Guliwo lies north of the Han Sea, with five thousand warriors. The land abounds with lilies. It produces fine horses, their heads resembling camels’, capable of running several hundred *li*. The land extends north to the sea, the farthest from the capital. Beyond the sea to the north, days are long and nights short; when the sun sets, a roasted sheep’s shoulder is done, and dawn has already broken in the east—this is near the place of sunrise."

Yet the names of these states differ. Could it be that over the long passage of time, pronunciations have diverged?

*The Collected Talks of the Old Scholar of Shuzhai* states: "Commissioner Xu Xianchen said that in Anggila, the sun does not set; only a streak of dark qi veils it, and by the time a sheep’s shoulder is cooked, the sun has risen again. Liu Jingzhi of Baoding, who served as a judge, witnessed this himself." This also matches the account of Guliwo in the *Tang History*, though the place names differ—perhaps due to changes over time.

From this, it is evident that the sun and moon do not rise and set beneath the earth but revolve beneath the North Pole to create day and night, a truth supported by evidence.

Pursuing this line of thought, Xunsiqan lies nearly twenty thousand *li* from the Central Plains, while India is equally distant from Xunsiqan, and Fu cha is again equally distant from India. *The Western Envoy’s Record* states: "The *New Tang History* records: ‘Fulin lies forty thousand *li* from the capital, upon the Western Sea.’ The rare and wondrous goods it produces align precisely with those of today in terms of distance—there can be no doubt of this." Though the route winds and twists, it is undeniably remote, spanning countless tens of thousands of *li*.

The annotation to the *Shuangxi Collection*’s poem "Dingling" notes: "During the reign of the sagely Taizong of our dynasty, an edict was issued to He Rui and others to enter the Northern Sea. After several years of travel, they reached the Mountain of the Unsetting Sun."

Yu Hao’s *Archaeological Records of the Western Regions* cites the *Record of Western Travels*: "In the spring of the *wuyin* year, we departed from Yunzhong, reached the Celestial Mountains, crossed the great desert, traversed the shifting sands, and arrived at the imperial encampment. The following year, a grand western expedition was launched, passing through the Golden Mountains. It was midsummer, yet snow congealed and ice accumulated, so we hewed a path through the ice. Pines and cypresses soared into the heavens, while flowers and grasses filled the valleys. West of the Golden Mountains, all waters flowed westward into the sea. To its south lay a Uyghur city named Bieshiba, where a Tang stele stood—this was the Hanhai Garrison (cited in juan ten)."

Yu’s annotation explains: "The *Tang History: Uyghur Annals* states: ‘After the fall of the Uyghurs, their remnants took refuge in the mountains and forests, living as bandits among the various tribes. During the reign of Emperor Yizong, the great chieftain Pugu Jun struck north from Beiting, beheaded Shang Kongre, and sent his head to the capital. Thereupon, the two prefectures of Xiting were both recovered, and envoys were dispatched to submit to the court. Later, their history was lost to record. Yet their state never recovered, and they continued to trade sheep and horses at the frontier.’ This is the origin of the Uyghurs’ Five Cities. The Hanhai Garrison was established in Beiting by Guo Yuanzhen at the beginning of the Jinglong era. Bieshiba is a corruption of Bieshibali. During the Yuan, there was a Branch Secretariat of Bieshibali."

Several hundred *li* from the city lies the Hanhai Sea, within which is an islet entirely covered in feathers shed by the birds that alight there. Two hundred *li* west of the city stands Luntai County, where a Tang stele remains. Five hundred *li* to the city’s south lies Hezhou, which was Tang’s Gaochang and is also called Yizhou.

Li’s annotation notes: "The *Illustrated Gazetteer of the Western Regions* states: ‘Tang’s Yizhou is today’s Hami.’ It also says: ‘Today’s Zhenxi Prefecture is ancient Yizhou. Pizhan is ancient Gaochang.’"

Examining the *Yuanhe Junxian Zhi* and the *Taiping Huanyu Ji*, the Tang’s Beiting Protectorate-General commanded three armies to defend against the Türgesh and the Kirghiz. It oversaw the Hanhai, Tianshan, Yiwu, and Hanhai Armies, with a garrison of twelve thousand troops stationed within the city (as above).
