**The True Interpretation of the Journey to the West, Chapter One**

**The Spiritual Root Takes Form and Flows Forth; Cultivation of Mind and Nature Gives Birth to the Great Dao**

Wu Yizi said: This clarifies that the root-source of the Great Dao is the primordial qi of yin and yang, the precelestial origin of the Hunyuan Taiyi, the True Yi born from nonbeing. By fully realizing the mind and knowing one’s nature through cultivation, one may attain an indestructible golden body and live as long as heaven and earth.

The two guiding lines of this chapter place greatest emphasis on the first, which encapsulates the author’s overarching principle. Those who interpret it by focusing solely on the word "mind," recklessly imposing misguided annotations, obscure the root-source of the Great Dao and thus fail to comprehend it. Not only do they misunderstand the mind, but they entirely abandon the true essence of the immortal masters’ teachings on liberating the world—how lamentable, how pitiful!

The "spiritual root" spoken of first is the precelestial True Yi qi. As the *Classic* says: *"Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things."* It also states: *"These two emerge together but bear different names."* When it is in its qi-state, the True Yi qi is invisible, hence it is the beginning of heaven and earth. When it takes form, the True Yi pearl appears within the void, hence it is the mother of the myriad things. From the One qi arise yin and yang; from yin and yang arise the Four Images; from the Four Images arise the Five Phases; from the Five Phases arise the myriad things—all transformations of the True Yi qi.

As qi, it stands before heaven and earth and enters within them. It begins as being born from nonbeing, then reverts to being born from being. One who attains this One qi can encompass all phenomena. Thus it is said: *"Obtain the One, and all matters are complete."*

*The Awakening to Reality* states:
*"The Dao from emptiness gives birth to the One qi,
From the One qi arise yin and yang,
Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,
From the Three Bodies flourish the myriad things."*

The *Book of Changes* says: *"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things transform into purity."*

From the beginning, the Primordial One attained the Dao through a single precious pearl. The sages of the Three Teachings all directly explored this root-source, penetrating the workings of creation.

For the Dao gives birth to the One qi, the One qi gives birth to form, and within form is contained the original qi. Thus, *"Heaven One gives birth to water,"* and water is Ren-water. Ren is the ancestral qi of the True One that generates all things. Ren-water’s phase of long life is in *shen* (the ninth earthly branch), and *shen* is the monkey. *Shen*-metal is born from earth, and stone is the essence and core of earth’s qi—hence the Stone Monkey.

According to the celestial cycle of 365 degrees, the twenty-four qi, the Nine Palaces, and the Eight Trigrams, this aligns with what *The Awakening to Reality* states: *"The Five Phases and Four Images all rely on earth; how could the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams depart from Ren?"*

Yi is the wood of flowers and fruit, born in *zhen* (the east), the place where yang qi first arises. Its natal tone is metal within the sea, hence its location in the Flower-Fruit Mountain of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. This metal within water is the true gold of the precelestial True Yi before the birth of one’s parents—thus, without father or mother, it is born from a stone egg by Heaven as father and Earth as mother.

Its eyes emitted two beams of golden light, but after consuming postnatal water, the golden light receded and gradually faded, losing its originally endowed nature. Because it is metal within water, it dwells in the Water-Curtain Cave. Within it lies an iron-plank bridge, clearly a celestial and terrestrial creation, not something fashioned by human effort. Such an endowment, once obtained, means *"my fate is not determined by Heaven"*—one is no longer subject to the qi of old Heaven.

Indeed, it is the supreme sovereign of joy between Heaven and Earth, hence the title Handsome Monkey King. From what I have heard of the reckoning of Heaven and Earth, this fully clarifies the profound subtleties of the spiritual root’s origin and flow—yet nowhere is the word "heart" to be found. The immortal master employs a poetic turn, subtly shifting the focus onto the human body, making it abundantly clear: he borrows the name of the monkey merely to complete the perfection of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao. Were all people through the ages to achieve such perfection, they too would be called outer kings and inner sages, free to act as they please—not because the heart is difficult to master.

The following passage then explains that one must personally examine its wonders, fully comprehend the heart and know one’s nature, and diligently cultivate and uphold what is most precious. The human body is hard to obtain, a century passes in an instant; one should urgently awaken the heart of the Dao and strive for oneself. Know that the Way of immortals, Buddhas, and sages, the method of longevity and agelessness, is within everyone’s reach—yet how pitiful that all people in the world are mere pursuers of fame and profit, with not a single one attending to their own life and destiny. Thus, the immortal master points out a path: journey westward to inquire, reaching the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift, to seek out the whereabouts of a divine immortal.

Alas! Do immortals choose where they are born? Could it truly be that the Southern Jambu Continent has none, while the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift does? The immortal master’s intent is merely to indicate that the south is a land where fire flourishes, not a place where metal is born—only in the west is true gold produced. This aligns with the overarching theme of the entire book: the scriptures must be sought in the west.

He speaks of a filial gentleman, for filial piety is the foundation of practicing benevolence and is akin to the Way of immortals. Thus, they are neighbors, and within this lies a profound meaning. The Way of immortals is water giving birth to metal, not metal giving birth to water—an image of the mother nurturing the child in the womb, the child repaying the mother’s kindness, both mirroring the path of filial piety.

The woodcutter said, “Not far, not far. This mountain is called the Mountain of the Numinous Terrace and Square Inch; upon it lies the Cave of the Slanting Moon and Three Stars. Within the cave dwells a divine immortal, known as the Venerable Patriarch Subhūti.” *Subhūti* in Sanskrit means the true Dao in our tongue. Here, the text explicitly mentions the Numinous Terrace and Square Inch—a hook and three dots—readers will surely say this refers to the character for "heart," and how could I deny it points to the heart?

Alas! They are mistaken.

If one claims this refers to the heart, then by inquiring into the heart, engaging in meditation, sitting in dhyāna, dispelling desires, and following principle, one could attain longevity—why then seek immortality, quest for the Dao, or rush about east and west? To regard this heart as the heart of Heaven and Earth may be acceptable, but to take it as the heart of the human heart is far from the mark!

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Not far off is the return; in the return is seen the heart of Heaven and Earth."* Yet the heart of Heaven and Earth cannot be seen—only through the hexagram *Fù* (Return), Earth and Thunder, is the heart of Heaven and Earth revealed. For when stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and from movement, yang is born. Generation upon generation continues, all rooted in *Kūn* (Earth). Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says: *"By the mother is the foundation laid"*—that is, *Kūn* gives birth to *Fù*. It further states: *"The sixth line of *Kūn* upholds, binding beginning and end. It nurtures all children, ever the mother of kinds."* This is the mother of the ten thousand things. Hence the woodcutter says: *"That patriarch’s disciples are beyond count"*—meaning all things emerge from this. He adds: *"Now there are still thirty or forty following him in cultivation."* Those who follow are three in the east, four in the west, and ten in the center, while the patriarch himself is one in the north and two in the south—*Kǎn* and *Lí* in harmonious union, the five phases gathered in clarity.

He further instructs: *"Follow that small path southward; his home is not far."* From the west to the southwest is not far—is this not the position of *Kūn*? The *Book of Changes* says: *"In the southwest, one gains companions and proceeds with one’s kind."* The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *"Only in the southwest lies one’s native place."* The small path is the position of *Duì* in the west, *Duì* being lesser yin, hence called a "small path." "His home" is precisely what the *Wuzhen Pian* refers to as *"recognizing the deathless method of that other household."*

First, he says, *"Not far, not far,"* then simply *"not far,"* clearly alluding to the meaning of *"not far off is the return."* Finally, he says, *"about seven or eight *li* distant"*—seven and eight make fifteen, the phase of gold meeting the full moon, its meaning subtle indeed.

At the outset of the immortal master’s chapter, he cites Shao Yaofu’s poem:
*"At the winter solstice, half of *zǐ*,
The heart of Heaven remains unchanged.
Where the first yang stirs,
Before the ten thousand things arise."*
This clarifies the root of Heaven and reveals the locus of the heart of Heaven. *"Silent and still, with no trace of man"*—this is the extreme of yin stillness. Yet before stillness reaches its extreme, the heart of Heaven and Earth is not seen; only when stillness first stirs is the heart of Heaven and Earth revealed. Thus, the image of the Handsome Monkey King leaping onto a pine branch to pluck fruit elucidates the meaning of *Zhèn* (Thunder) wood’s initial stirring at the *zǐ* hour.

Such are the profound principles expounded. The boy says: *"My master was lecturing on the Dao but did not explain the reason. He sent me to fetch you—I suppose it must be you."* The Monkey King replies: *"It is I, it is I!"*—here lies another subtle meaning. For the essence of true yi resides in the east but dwells in the west—this is the principle of yin and yang inverted. Since birth, it has wandered in that other household; now, recognizing it and stating the cause, it is clearly one’s own original possession. Hence he says, *"It is I, it is I!"*—echoing the earlier phrase *"that other household."*

Seeing the Venerable Patriarch Subhūti seated upon the dais, with thirty young immortals standing to either side, this embodies the meaning of the *Cantong Qi*: *"The sixth line of *Kūn* upholds, binding beginning and end"*—five times six is thirty. Later immortals also take the *Kūn* direction as the place of the moon’s birth, symbolized by the crescent moon. The hook is the crescent, the three dots the three stars. The moon receives the true yang qi and generates brightness, within which lies the image of the three stars—essence, qi, and spirit. *Fù* is the first of yang, the new moon the first of the month. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says: *"Five times six, thirty days, the cycle completes and begins anew."* Master Wei equates the thirty days of the moon with the *Kūn* hexagram—both express the same idea.

The poem of the Greatly Awakened Golden Immortal, in its emptiness and true suchness, reveals in every line that only by recognizing the heart of Heaven can one be a great master of the Dharma. Yet to fully realize this heart, one must know one’s nature. Knowing one’s nature, one knows the subtlety of the heart of Heaven and completes the great Dao.

The Monkey King, with sincere heart and clear ritual, journeys from east to west—all to seek knowledge of his nature. He says: *"I have no nature,"* *"I have no parents,"* *"I suppose I was born from a tree,"* *"No, I grew from stone."* For after birth, he was stained by worldly desires and gradually lost his primordial nature, no longer knowing himself as a thing of *Zhèn* wood from the east, nor as the body of *Duì* metal from the west. How could he not abandon the endowment bestowed by Heaven and Earth?

Thus, the greatly compassionate Subhūti says: *"I shall take a surname for you from your own body. Ancient moon, old yin, cannot transform to bear male offspring—yet ‘infant’ fits perfectly with this discourse."* The immortal master has already revealed the wondrousness within nature; no further words are needed. The Monkey King exclaims: *"Good!"*

"Excellent! Excellent! Only today do I know my surname." He then exclaimed, "Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! From this day forth, I shall be called Sun Wukong!" Should one grasp the meaning of the characters *hao* (excellent), *xing* (surname), and *kong* (emptiness), one would be a being of vast wisdom, a true suchness of the ocean of original nature, awakened and perfectly enlightened. Thus it is said: *"When chaos first parted, no surnames existed—shatter the stubborn void, and you must awaken to emptiness."* Yet to perceive the true nature of the primordial, one must delve deeply into the acquired.

**Chapter Two: Penetrating the Wondrous Truth of the Dao—Severing Demons to Return and Merge with the Original Spirit**

Wu Yizi states: This reveals the true and wondrous transmission of the great alchemical Dao, subtly illustrating the method of *"taking from Kan to fill Li,"* thereby returning to the root and merging with the original spirit. The key lies in the two characters *"penetrating awakening"*—one must focus the mind here. The principles of the true and wondrous Dao require profound awakening and thorough penetration, and only with the transmission of a true master can one properly begin. It is not that this mind is the Dao, nor that awakening alone suffices. If self-cultivation through the mind alone could attain the Dao, then what is awakened? What is attained? This is but the practice of silent sitting in the gate of stillness—ultimately grasping at the moon’s reflection in water, all in vain. Thus, the chapter subtly hints at the meaning of *"severing demons"* to return and merge with the original spirit. When he retrieves the golden cudgel from his own cave, it fully embodies the principle of returning to the root and merging with the original spirit.

The immortal master’s poem reads:
*"The three families unite as they naturally are,
Pointing to the unborn, revealing the mystery of nature."*

People know the *"three families"* as three surnames, yet they do not know the three families are one surname. Knowing the wonder of the earlier poem—*"originally no surname"*—one then understands the wonder of this poem: *"the three families unite as they naturally are."* Though called three surnames, they are ultimately one surname; though called one surname, they are ultimately no surname.

When Wukong hears the master expound the Dao and recognizes its wondrous resonance, it is the moment when he can be spoken to of the Dao. On Rotten Peach Mountain, he ate his fill of peaches seven times. Rotten peaches symbolize the stripping away of the outer husk, revealing the kernel within. The *Cantong Qi* says: *"Stripping away the limbs, dissolving the form—when the Dao is exhausted, it returns, reverting to the primal Kun."* This is the time of *"stripping down to rise again."* The seven times signify the principle of *"the seventh day’s return."* At the moment when the Dao-heart manifests, the ancestral master declares that all four methods—movement, stillness, flow, and quietude—are side doors. Through question and answer, distinctions are made with clarity.

What is particularly startling is that within the *"flow"* category, the Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist traditions are deemed side doors, and within the *"stillness"* category, practices like *"pure quietude and non-action"* and *"guarding the spirit to enter samadhi"* are likewise labeled as such. This is bound to arouse astonishment. Why? The Confucian seeks to rectify the heart, the Buddhist to illuminate the mind, and the Daoist to contemplate the mind. *"Pure quietude and non-action"* is the heart-method of Laozi; *"meditating and entering samadhi"* is the mind-seal of the Buddha. All cultivate the mind, perfectly aligning with the interpretation of *"monkey-mind and horse-intent"* in *Journey to the West*, the understanding of *"gathering the scattered mind."* Yet now, it is said to be like *"setting a pillar in a wall"* or *"a brick in a kiln"*—abandoning this to seek the true mind elsewhere leaves one bewildered: where is it to be found?

Alas! This reveals the long-standing error in reading and interpreting *Journey to the West* as *"monkey-mind and horse-intent,"* the superficiality of *"gathering the scattered mind."* The immortal master has already made this plainly evident, and it is not my private opinion. The great sages of the three teachings devoted themselves to cultivating the Dao, not to equating the cultivation of the mind with the Dao. It is acceptable to say the Dao harmonizes with the monkey-mind; it is unacceptable to say the monkey-mind is the Dao. The common interpretations of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism as *"monkey-mind and horse-intent,"* as *"gathering the scattered mind,"* are why the master explicitly calls them side doors, not the supreme and true great Dao of the golden elixir.

This Dao, even the naturally most intelligent Wukong could not comprehend—thus he had to seek the transmission from Subhuti. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *"Even if one’s wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not force guesses."* Had Wukong not been of the most naturally intelligent and wished to force guesses from within himself, could he have heard of it? There are also those vulgar and foolish men who, with their *"yin-cultivation and yang-supplementation"* heresies, deceive and distort the sacred scriptures. Thus, the master first refutes their delusions in the *"movement"* category, urging those with aspirations to learn the Dao to pay close attention.

This Dao is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas—it is not imparted to those unworthy. The Patriarch Subhuti set it as a riddle within a tray, transmitting it in secret. Wukong was able to shatter the tray, kneel in faith, and receive it—truly a seed of Buddhahood. The Patriarch then chanted from his mouth: *"Difficult! Difficult! Difficult!"*

The Dao is most profound.
Do not treat the Golden Elixir as commonplace.
Without meeting a perfected master to transmit the wondrous formula,
One’s words will but parley the tongue dry!

Know then that the Way of the Golden Elixir must be received through a master’s transmission—it cannot be sought among men. Yet though Wukong shattered the tray’s riddle, discerning that three taps meant the third watch, that the closed gate was the back door for entry, and that the Dao was transmitted in secret, he still regulated his breath, gathered his spirit, and waited until the hour before or after midnight to stealthily open the back door, approach the sleeping couch, and kneel to beseech the Way of long life. The Patriarch intoned:

*"The wondrous formula of perfect esoteric and exoteric teachings—
Nothing else avails in cultivating nature and destiny.
All comes down to essence, qi, and spirit:
Guard them firmly, seal them well, let no leakage occur.
Let no leakage occur—conceal them within the body,
And the Dao you receive shall flourish of itself.
Remember this oral formula, for it brings great benefit:
Banish perverse desires to attain cool clarity.
Attain cool clarity, and radiance will shine pure.
Then ascend the cinnabar terrace to admire the bright moon.
The moon conceals the Jade Hare, the sun conceals the Golden Crow,
While the Tortoise and Serpent coil in mutual embrace.
Coiled in embrace, nature and destiny grow firm,
Enabling one to plant golden lotuses in fire.
Gathering and reversing the Five Agents,
When the work is complete, one becomes Buddha or immortal."*

This is the beginning and end of the Golden Elixir’s workings, every word encompassing all. If one receives the oral formula’s guidance, one may then hear the Dao. Within it, the three crucial words—essence, qi, and spirit—lest they be misconstrued, I shall explicitly point out: this essence is not the essence of intercourse, this qi is not the qi of breathing, and this spirit is not the spirit of thought. Take care not to grope within your own mind and fall into the delusion of the "monkey-mind and horse-intent," mistaking the "scattered mind" for the true.

The Patriarch revealed the root source, and Wukong memorized the oral formula, secretly upholding it. The workings of the Golden Elixir—warming and nurturing before midnight and after noon—after three years, his dharma-nature became quite penetrating. Yet after five hundred years, Heaven would send a thunder calamity, requiring him to see his nature and clarify his mind. Know that seeing one’s nature and clarifying the mind are matters *after* the Elixir’s completion. Without seeing nature and clarifying the mind, principle and desire remain mixed, unable to achieve purity, and one falls into heterodoxy. Thus, the heavenly spirits cannot tolerate it, and the thunder calamity is unavoidable. Such external disasters are still relatively easy to evade. But if one cannot see nature and clarify the mind, the body’s yin fire remains unremoved, and over time, it accumulates into harm, spontaneously generating fire calamities. If one cannot see nature and clarify the mind, the body’s yin qi remains uncleansed, and over time, it accumulates into misfortune, spontaneously generating wind calamities. These three calamities arise after the Dao’s completion, necessitating a return to the ultimate state of non-action and original truth.

After transmitting the oral formula, the Patriarch saw the practitioner master transformations: first climbing clouds, then the somersault cloud, all demonstrating that by seeing nature and clarifying the mind, one can transcend the mundane and share in Heaven and Earth’s transformations, progressing from strenuous effort to spiritual transformation. Readers of *Journey to the West* see the seventy-two transformations and the thirty-six-thousand-mile somersault and interpret them as the mind. But if it were merely the mind, it would be empty delusion—precisely the "scattered mind"—what true reality or solid foundation would there be? They do not know that this is the wondrous efficacy of the Golden Elixir, a true and practical skill. Transformations are not limited to ten thousand times ten thousand, but are summarized by the seventy-two seasonal qi movements; somersaults are not limited to ten thousand times ten thousand, but are summarized by the number of the two *zang* organs. This Dao is only for self-knowledge and should not be flaunted before crowds. Thus, since ancient times, Buddhas and immortals who attained the Dao would transcend and depart, concealing their brilliance, for they had truly seen their nature and clarified their minds.

When the practitioner transformed into a tree to play tricks, he inevitably startled the crowd—what kind of world would that be? Thus, the Patriarch said: *"Dare you flaunt this skill before others? If someone seeks it from you, should you fear misfortune, you may only transmit it to them; if you do not, they will surely harm you."* From this, know that as long as one has not left the mortal world, one must never flaunt one’s skills before others. Therefore, the Patriarch transmitted another method to him, saying: *"Go now. Return whence you came."* This was to teach him to return to his origin to avoid calamity.

Nevertheless, the seventy-two transformations correspond to the year’s seasonal nodes; climbing clouds represents the arrival of dharma-essence; "beware the intentional man" means to guard one’s mind closely; the thirty-six thousand miles correspond to the number of the two *zang* organs; transforming into a pine tree signifies the union of metal and wood, lead and mercury; the moving tongue that stirs up right and wrong signifies the need for discreet refinement; not flaunting before others is to guard against unforeseen calamities; "whence you came, thither return" means coming from the East and returning to the East—this is how one preserves life and nature. Only those who have received a master’s transmission may claim to have mastered it. In less than an hour, he saw Flower-Fruit Mountain and the Water-Curtain Cave, and the Handsome Monkey King knew bliss—for the Golden Elixir had succeeded. Here again is a riddle within a riddle, a mystery within a mystery, which no ordinary person could shatter. All are whispered secrets, wondrous methods within the oral formula.

The oral formula of the Golden Elixir could not be written down by the Patriarch, and fearing that worldly people would forever struggle to comprehend it, he subtly revealed its meaning to Wukong after his return to the cave, enacting a tale of demon-quelling. It was made clear that upon returning to the cave, one must first sever this demon. The Monkey King was metal within water, departing the East for the West. From the day of his departure, the water of due North mingled with the Water-Curtain Cave, and the monkeys of the cave mingled with the water *zang* of due North—hence, the "Demon King of the Turbid World."

"Due North belongs to *Kan*, hence he wields a blade; its color is black, so he wears a black headscarf, dons a dark robe, black armor below, and black boots. Within *Kan* lies metal, yet through turbidity it becomes a demon.

Wukong said, 'I hail from due South.'
Due South is the *Li* Palace.
No weapon, bare head, red garments, a yellow sash, and riding boots—all embody the essence of *Li*.
Within fire yet metal gleams—is this not the absence of weapons?
Round in form, like the sun—is this not a bare head?
The sun’s radiance—is this not red clothing?
The sun’s yellow path—is this not a yellow sash?
The golden crow within the sun—is this not black boots?
Most wondrous are the two hands hooking the moon at the edge of the sky.
The moon is true *yin*, coupling with the sun to birth yang’s soul.
The waxing moon is hooked by the left hand, the waning moon by the right.
When the moon is full, yang’s soul fills its wheel, and both hands hook it.
Thus, one who can hook the moon at the sky’s edge completes the great Dao, and the visceral demon severs itself—hence, the demonic metal is seized and turned to one’s use.
A single strike to the crown splits it in two—how marvelous!
The water of due North’s *Kan*, cleaved in two by one blade, transforms the odd into the even.
*Kan*’s water, now steadfast, reverts to *Kun*—is this not scorched dry, wholly returning to the unity of *Qian*?
The lost child vanishes and instantly returns home, while the *Water-Visceral Cave*’s monkeys, no longer adrift, tread solid ground, recognize their homeland, and escape *Kan* to fill *Qian* and exhaust *Li*.

Wukong then utters the words of the Dao’s absence in the South, pointing the way to the West.
Such brushstrokes in the Immortal Master’s book—without penetrating *yin-yang* or fathoming creation’s workings, how could one grasp their meaning?
This is what is called 'severing the demon to return to the root and unite with the primordial spirit'—is this not the true merit of sharing heaven’s lifespan, the great gateway to undying longevity?
With the attainment of pure yang, descendants endure unbroken, transformations boundless—how could heaven, earth, or the netherworld restrain them?

**Chapter Three: The Four Seas and Thousand Mountains All Bow in Submission, The Nine Netherworlds and Ten Kinds All Lose Their Names**

Wu Yizi said: This elucidates the great Dao of the Golden Elixir as the metal within water. One who attains its truth can, from the near to the distant, from the manifest to the hidden, extend their will without hindrance across the earth.
Since obtaining the metal from the *Demon King of the Turbid World*, Wukong swiftly seized the metal from the armory of Aolai Country, then gathered the tribute metal from the seventy-two caves. Flower Fruit Mountain became an ironclad golden fortress, its foundation unshakable, its reach boundless—yet it had not yet attained spiritual communion.
Thus, the Monkey King said, 'This blade of mine is truly fierce, but it does not fulfill my intent.'
For this Dao prizes centrality and purity, only then can it advance unimpeded.
Thus, the quest to seek broadly from the sea cannot cease."

Seeking the iron plate beneath the Iron-Plate Bridge is a principle of certainty. One who styles himself a Heaven-Born Sage, beyond birth and extinction, and claims extraordinary destiny must obtain the Ultimate Oneness to wield it.

The Dragon King produced a great halberd—this was Qian’s first yang, yet it was not to be used. He then brought forth a nine-pronged fork—this was Qian’s fourth yang, but it did not suit his intent. The weight of three thousand six hundred catties corresponded to four nines, thirty-six, encompassing the first, second, and third yang lines. Next appeared a painted-shaft square halberd—this was Qian’s third, fourth, and top yang lines, uniting three lines into eight nines, seven thousand two hundred catties—still not to his liking.

Only when the Heaven-River Bottom-Stabilizing Divine Iron was mentioned—Yu the Great’s gauge for measuring the depths of rivers and seas—did enlightenment dawn. This treasure had been passed from Yao to Shun, and Shun to Yu, transmitted through the sages as the essence of centrality, the very core of Qian’s fifth yang, the true mean of the Dragon’s virtue. None but a Heaven-Born Sage, possessed of effortless great courage, could bear such a burden! The Dragon King declared, "It cannot be lifted, nor carried!"

The iron radiated ten thousand beams of golden light—for from it arise all principles and all things. Its length of two *zhang* signified two fives making ten; the directions—east three, south two, north one, west four, center ten—were all embodied. The two golden bands at either end and the black iron in the center represented the principle of "grasping the two extremes and employing the mean." Named the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod, it weighed thirteen thousand five hundred catties—for compliance meant adapting perfectly to the mind’s every movement. Thirteen thousand five hundred catties corresponded to nine and five nines, forty-five—this was the nine-five. It also concealed the numbers three and four, twelve, symbolizing the directions of east, west, south, north, and center. Twelve thousand, plus fifteen, embodied the meaning of three and five. This instrument thus encompassed the entire hexagram of Qian.

As the Monkey King pondered and murmured, the rod shrank to a length of one *zhang* and two *chi*, as thick as a rice bowl—revealing its ability to transform at will, possessing constancy within inconstancy. The length of one *zhang* and two *chi* also signified three and four, twelve; the bowl’s mouth represented perfect roundness, showing inconstancy within constancy. For it was firm, strong, central, and pure—utterly refined. Such was the marvel of this enlightened instrument when grasped.

For centuries, readers and commentators of *Journey to the West* have all claimed this rod symbolizes the mind, fixating on the word "compliant." Yet do they not know the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s preface speaks of "the treasure of the sage, the correct Dao"? Is this truly the mind, or not? Why not ponder deeply the passage: "It begins with one principle, unfolds into ten thousand affairs, and in the end returns to one principle—when extended, it fills the six directions; when retracted, it withdraws into secrecy"?

The Golden-Hooped Rod, passed down through the sages, clearly embodies the essential principle of centrality. Daoist adepts call it "the metal within water"—the utmost truth and wonder within the great Dao, beyond words. When Wukong held it in his hand, he grasped the mean. "One guest does not offend two hosts," and "without a fixed destination, he does not leave"—this is the non-dual Dharma gate. "Walking three houses is not as good as sitting in one," and "seeking ten thousand things is still seeking one thing"—for three houses are ultimately one house, ten thousand things ultimately one thing, as the saying goes: "Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete." "Not going, not going, adapting to high and low"—this is not clinging to principle to chase after things, but awaiting their arrival to respond. "Beating the drum and striking the bell, all assemble in an instant"—its influence is vast, its spiritual resonance swift.

East is the Wood of the Azure Dragon, and only with the tribute of three beings was the rod made complete. Herein lies the meaning of consulting the Four Peaks and harmonizing the Four Symbols. Such was the subtlety of the immortal master’s naming.

The silk slippers emerged from water—this was the Dark Warrior, the north. The chainmail armor was forged from metal—this was the White Tiger, the west. The phoenix-winged crown blazed with fire—this was the Vermilion Bird, the south. Thus, from east, west, south, and north, all submitted without resistance. This was the guiding principle: "The thousand mountains and four seas all bow in submission."

Wukong leapt from the waves, his body not a drop wet. Golden light gleamed as he walked onto the bridge—for he now embodied the pure Qian hexagram, and the Dao’s essence was complete. Holding the treasure in his hand, he could make it large or small at will, displaying a divine power that modeled heaven and earth. The rod reached up to the thirty-third heaven and down to the eighteenth layer of hell. When he withdrew the cosmic form, it shrank back into an embroidery needle, which he tucked into his ear. Readers of *Journey to the West* marvel at such wondrous transformations, dismissing them as impossible—mere metaphors for the mind’s subtlety. Yet this is the most ordinary of principles: "When extended, it fills the six directions; when retracted, it withdraws into secrecy." How can this be called the "monkey mind" or "horse intent"?

This Dao commands not only the submission of demons, humans, and spirits but also the reverence of the hidden and the strange. The four monkeys and six kings make ten kinds. From the great—dragons, roc, lions, and macaques—to all creatures that fly, walk, or crawl, and all beings with consciousness, none are not encompassed by it.

Lord Laozi said: "The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Root of Creation. All men tread upon it to emerge, and all creeping things without exception proceed from it." For one who fully realizes their nature can fully realize the nature of all things. When one is fully realized, all are fully realized—and one can then "lay down the heart." Not "lay down the heart" but "lay the heart down," not "the heart laid down" but "lay down the heart"—the profound meaning therein is beyond the understanding of ordinary people.

Here yet arises a tangle of private interpretations and stolen insights. Critics who fix their gaze upon this point declare that the very harm of "laying down the heart" lies in its truth—at the threshold of life and death, to "lay down the heart" is to invite demonic delusions and drowsy torpor, plunging one into the netherworld. They regard Sun Wukong as never having attained the Dao, relying solely on forced preservation, missing the mark by a vast margin. The guiding principle states, *"The Nine Netherworlds and Ten Kinds are all erased from the register,"* for it is made clear that he has already attained the Dao, and thus nothing can bind him. The path of learning, indeed, seeks only to "lay down the heart." Yet if the Dao is truly perfected, one may follow the heart’s desires without restraint. Wukong has already obtained the Golden Cudgel, donned his full armor, and wields the mean with divine transformation—his powers unfathomable. Thus, the phrase *"lay down the heart"* is employed to reveal his unobstructed ascent to heaven and descent into earth. How could the mere word "death" stir his heart? Hence, the following passage first demonstrates his prowess by entering the netherworld and displaying his artifice.

Those who critique *Journey to the West* consistently mistake the heart for the Dao and "laying down the heart" for the heart’s harm, leading to myriad misinterpretations and a loss of truth. They fail to recognize that the heart is precisely the cause of life and death, the root of samsara. The sages speak of preserving the heart as the method for governing the world through moral teachings; the Buddhas and immortals speak of the heart’s absence as the way to transcend the world through non-action. Without penetrating the root, merely clinging to superficial theories of the heart, how can one escape the endless cycle of rebirth? For those who have not attained the Dao, death is death, and life is also death; for those who have attained it, life is life, and death is also life. Unifying life and death as one, one achieves longevity. Fear of death gives rise to the heart of death and thus fails to attain life; fearlessness of death dissolves the heart of life and thus fails to attain death. If one preserves the heart out of fear of death, death arrives swiftly; if one does not know where the heart is stored, it must reside where life arises—within death lies life, and within life lies death. Death after death, life after life—when will it end? Unaware of whether one is human or thing, enduring countless trials without liberation, this is the suffering of eternal death, not the joy of eternal life.

Wukong, asleep, saw two figures holding a writ bearing the name "Sun Wukong." The names they bore were inevitably one "Living Uncertain" and the other "Death’s Allotment"—inescapable, beyond human control. Wukong alone awoke in sudden realization, drew his treasure, and pounded the two death-summoners into mincemeat. He untied his bonds, stormed back into the city, turning the dead to life and the death-summoners to death. The Ten Yama Kings, thrown into chaos, could not command him and ordered him to inspect the Register of Life and Death himself. Upon reaching the *hun* section, entry 1,350, it matched the number of his treasure—also a combination of three and five. At 342 years, the "hundred" signified one hundred, also corresponding to the numbers of the five directions: east three, south two, west four, north one, and center ten. He took up the brush and struck through them all. The meaning of this single stroke is profound! The heart is the root of death. Its subtleties shall be expounded in another passage; for now, let us clarify the meaning of the character for "heart."

When the hook of the character *xin* (心, "heart") points upward, it signifies "not laying down the heart," and thus the ledger of death is recorded; when the hook points downward, it signifies "laying down the heart," and thus the ledger of death is erased. Striking through them all, he declared, *"Settled! Settled! From now on, you have no authority over me!"* Such actions shook heaven and earth. Yet for Wukong, it was as effortless as tripping over a blade of grass. A single stumble awakened him—this was the key. Ordinary people take their lives to be a dream; Wukong took death to be a dream. Ordinary people act as if dead while alive; Wukong erased his living name from within death. Venturing into the sea posed no obstacle to his body; entering the netherworld posed no obstacle to his spirit. His divine transformations in exiting and entering the netherworld reached their utmost subtlety. Why, then, did he trip over a blade of grass? The "blade of grass" (*caoda*) signifies the dawn of primordial chaos, like the initial hexagram *Zhun*, where chaos first parts, as if awakening from a dream. Yet without ascending to heaven, one cannot witness the power of its unfolding.

Observe how the two memorials reached directly to the heavens, as if serving as his passport. A celestial envoy arrived to welcome him, precisely as he was contemplating the heavens. How vast is the function of the Golden Elixir! Thus, the Perfected Lord of Purple Yang said: *"Swallow a grain of the Golden Elixir, and you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven."*

**Chapter Four: Appointed as Protector of the Horses—Heart Still Unsatisfied; Named Equal of Heaven—Intent Yet Unsettled**

Master Wu Yi Zi said: This reveals the great Dao of the Golden Fluid and Returning Elixir, where one’s lifespan equals that of heaven, soaring above the Nine Heavens, transcending all bounds—even the Heavenly Emperor cannot restrain him. The Heavenly Emperor, sovereign of heaven and earth, governs the netherworld, encompasses past and present, and has no equal. Only the sage can observe the Dao of heaven and grasp its workings, harmonizing yin and yang, uniting with the divine in virtue, and transforming all things to stand alongside heaven. Why is this so?

Gold is indestructible through kalpas; the Elixir is the essence of sun and moon, a mass of pure Yang qi. What heaven and earth circulate is qi; what the Golden Elixir transforms is also qi. The qi of heaven and earth encompasses all; the qi of the Golden Elixir contains all. Thus the *Cantong Qi* states: *"Nurture essence and cultivate spirit, commune with the virtue of the Three Lights. All evil disperses, and the true qi abides."* It also says: *"Hidden and submerged, it transforms within, enfolding the myriad things as the warp and woof of the Dao."* Both speak of the sage’s body and measure equaling that of heaven. What the *Book of Changes* calls *"harmonizing virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with sun and moon, fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits"*—how does this differ from the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s *"Heaven and earth take their places, the myriad things are nurtured, all learned and practiced from childhood"*? That the great sage equals heaven in name—what doubt can there be?

Those who read *Journey to the West* misread its key themes, taking *"heart still unsatisfied"* and *"intent yet unsettled"* as mere "monkey-mind and horse-will," seizing half a phrase or a single word to force their interpretations. All because they fail to grasp the vastness of the Golden Elixir’s Dao. The Dao of the Golden Elixir unites the Five Emperors and returns to the Supreme Ultimate, steers kalpas through the boundless, and transcends the constraints of heaven and earth—how could the post of Heavenly Stablemaster suffice to match its office? Even the empty title of "Equal of Heaven" cannot exhaust its measure.

When the Star of Metal and the Monkey King ascend together on clouds, why is the Star of Metal left behind? The Star of Metal is but one of the Five Phases; Sun Wukong embodies all Five Phases. Yet why does he block the gates of heaven, refusing entry? Even the heavenly deities cannot recognize him. The Star of Metal says they have never met, and that upon seeing the Heavenly Honored One, he may come and go as he pleases. Why then does Wukong say, *"Very well, I shall not enter"*? It is simply that he refuses to be bound by heaven.

The Star of Metal reports: *"The demonic immortal has arrived."* The Jade Emperor asks: *"Which one is the demonic immortal?"* To call Wukong a demon is a misnomer. Wukong responds at once: *"This old monkey is."* Accepting the title without refusal reveals his capacity for inclusion. All the immortal ministers recoil in shock—his stature is clearly beyond theirs. The Emperor then says: *"This demonic immortal from the lower realm, newly attained human form, does not understand court etiquette."* Though the Heavenly Emperor displays magnanimity, he has not yet discerned Wukong’s wondrous nature as the primordial True One. This is the root of his later inability to subdue him.

Wukong bows deeply toward the throne, accepting without refusal. Is this not Wukong encompassing the Heavenly Emperor? The Heavenly Stables lack a director, and the Jade Emperor issues a decree appointing him *Bima Wen*. Upon taking office, *Bima* works day and night without rest, embodying the meaning of *"Heaven’s movement is ceaseless; the noble person exerts unrelenting effort, vigilant even at dusk, ever striving."* Those who annotate *Journey to the West* misinterpret this as the fire-timing of midnight and noon—truly a heretical and absurd reading.

Yet what is called a "horse" in heaven would surely be called a "dragon" on earth. What is named the "Heavenly Stables" in heaven would surely be named the "Dragon Taming Bureau" on earth. Wukong asks: *"No rank—does that mean it’s extremely high?"* The crowd replies: *"It’s called ‘Unranked.’"* What is "unranked" in heaven becomes the highest rank when viewed from the earthly realm. Why then does Wukong say: *"I won’t do it, I won’t do it"*? In ancient times, Emperor Yao sought to yield the world to Xu You and Chao Fu, who washed their ears to cleanse the taint of such an offer. How could one as great as Wukong willingly remain in the post of Heavenly Stablemaster?

With a sudden crash, he overturns his seat, draws out his treasure, and smashes his way out of the stables, heading straight for the Southern Gate of Heaven. What resolute transcendence! Unaware, his heart ignites with fury, his mind seething with indignation—this reveals that to assign the office of stablemaster to one who steers kalpas is a fundamental contradiction, utterly impossible. The fire in his heart, the rage in his mind, arise from the natural effulgence of his golden light. Annotators again mistake this for "scattered thoughts and wild intentions." But in the radiant presence of the Heavenly Emperor, could one with scattered thoughts and wild intentions roam freely, unchecked and unchallenged?

Purple Yang the Perfected says: *"Swallow a grain of the Golden Elixir, and you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven."* The ancestral master Wei Boyang says: *"Heaven and earth, gods and spirits, cannot be fathomed. Use them to secure your body, conceal your form, and hide."* The forms, images, and numbers of heaven and earth are known to all. But the mechanisms of divine concealment and ghostly stealth remain beyond human comprehension. Only the sage knows that essence becomes things and wandering souls transform. Thus, understanding the conditions of ghosts and spirits, he masters their utility and secures his body. The cosmos rests in his hand; creation arises from his heart. He emerges from being and enters non-being, his presence and absence unfathomable. Knowing this, one understands that the great sage’s descent to earth and ascent to heaven are matters of true intent and real application, not subject to heaven’s constraints.

Thus, the Single-Horned Demon King pledges allegiance to him. A king with a single horn is a sovereign. The offering of the cinnabar-yellow robe symbolizes the principle of *"yellow at the center, penetrating all patterns."* Urging him to proclaim himself the Great Sage Equal of Heaven and raise his banner is to declare that authority rests with him, not heaven. The robe is yellow with a cinnabar hue—surpassing red, it embodies the meaning of *"Yang at its apex."* A king who rules himself is lofty indeed.

Herein lies the image of the Ascendant Dragon. Though it has subdued the root of future chaos and rebellion, when the Jade Emperor appointed Li Tianwang as the Great Marshal to Subdue Demons, seeking to capture and tame the Great Sage, he failed to examine the origins of his nurturance or the subtleties of his cultivation. Instead, he mistook the Great Sage for a demon—no wonder he could not subdue him.

Thus, when the Giant Spirit Deity struck once and fled, and Nezha struck once and fled, how could it be strange that one whose sageliness was whole triumphed over the lesser denizens of heaven? That the Giant Spirit fled without a fight was only fitting. Yet when Nezha transformed—sprouting three heads, six arms, and ten thousand thousand forms—this was the three horizontal lines of *Qian*, the image of myriad transformations following nature. The Great Sage likewise transformed—three heads, six arms, ten thousand thousand forms—also the three horizontal lines of *Qian*, the image of myriad transformations following nature. Their forms were equal, their strength matched.

Why, then, did the Great Sage pluck a single hair, reveal his original form, and strike Nezha’s left shoulder from behind, sending him fleeing? For Nezha stood first, as the lower three lines of *Qian*, while the Great Sage stood after, as the upper three lines of *Qian*. At the apex of pure Yang, it must transform and return to the first line, breaking its rigidity—was this not the plucking of a single hair to reveal his original form, striking from behind to wound the left shoulder?

Heaven mistook the Great Sage for a demon, taking truth for falsehood, and thus the Six Demons proclaimed themselves sages, inverting falsehood as truth. Not only could it not subdue the sage, but it could not even subdue demons. Heaven, seeing the sage as a demon, could not subdue a single demon; the sage, seeing demons as sages, could subdue a host of sages. All later subduals of a thousand demons and ten thousand monsters stemmed from this. His capacity had long since encompassed what lay beyond heaven—how could the empty title of "Equal of Heaven" bind him?

When the Heavenly King’s son returned to report and request troops, the Jade Emperor, astonished by his words, still deemed them mad and sought to execute him. This was precisely what the Buddha had foretold: *"All the hosts of heaven shall be struck with doubt."* The Star of Venus then memorialized, "Fearing we cannot subdue him at once, I beg to appoint him as the Great Sage Equal of Heaven, to curb his wayward heart." The Jade Emperor assented and issued the decree, as if heaven could thus indulge the sage.

Yet indulging the sage while failing to subdue him arose from the misguided attempt to "curb his wayward heart." For if Wukong were not a sage, he could not be indulged; once indulged as a sage, how could his "waywardness" be removed? To call it waywardness while indulging it was to indulge the waywardness itself—how could this lead to subjugation? The later chaos in the Peach Orchard was not Wukong’s doing, but the result of the Jade Emperor and the Golden Star indulging him to create disorder. What intent did Wukong have? When he saw the peaches, he ate them—what else could he do but follow the sage’s or the demon’s nature as it arose?

The Jade Emperor said, "Wukong, come forth. I now proclaim you the Great Sage Equal of Heaven." The rank was supreme. Yet what the Jade Emperor deemed the highest office, Wukong merely acknowledged with a bow, no different from his time as Keeper of the Heavenly Stables. He did not regard the title of Great Sage Equal of Heaven as the ultimate rank, for his greatness was self-proclaimed, his equality with heaven self-declared—it was not the emperor who made him great or equal. Since he had already made himself great and equal, how could one prevent him from being so? And how could one make him content or at peace?

The establishment of two empty offices was of no benefit—it only served to oversee his discontent and his incompleteness.

Wukuyi said: This reveals the Dao of heaven where things reach their extreme and must reverse—a mechanism beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits, the natural operation of the primordial True Unity’s qi, not something the Great Sage could claim as his own design. The immortal master merely borrows names and images to depict its wonder. Those who mistake this for a mere "monkey of the mind" take it as a display of literary skill, while those who fail to grasp the principle see it as mere stylistic variation—how far they stray from the truth by a hair’s breadth!

The Great Sage established himself in rectitude, matching heaven in name—this is the ninth line of Qian, the image of the ascendant dragon. When yang reaches its extreme, it must reverse: such is the natural principle. How could the Great Sage truly reverse it? How could the Heavenly Palace truly be overturned? The Heavenly Palace is Qian as heaven, the palace of the ninth line—could the Great Sage truly reverse it? Yet reversal must begin with disorder, and disorder must have its cause and occasion.

Why does the text speak of the "monkey of the mind" running wild, conjuring these illusions, weaving clusters of literary flowers merely to dazzle the eyes and mind? The Palace of Equality with Heaven stands to the right of the Peach Orchard, so the orchard must lie to the left. The Dao of heaven turns leftward. The Great Sage dwells at the pinnacle of pure yang, yang within yang—his qi shifts from warmth to heat, the time when the myriad things flourish, when yang reaches its extreme and becomes ascendant.

At the summer solstice, a single yin is born, yet its force cannot reverse into yin; instead, it turns leftward toward the Peach Orchard. The left side is the Green Dragon, belonging to wood, hence the peach—this is the idle provocation of a true person. The Jade Emperor’s authority over the peaches is the inevitable course of qi’s movement, not something the Great Sage could control.

Those who doubt may ask: If the Great Sage has attained the primordial Dao, mastering yin and yang without being manipulated by them, why can he not control himself from reversing? They do not understand that the primordial Dao moves both in accord and in opposition. The primordial Dao is opposed in its embodiment, reversing yin into yang, becoming sage, immortal, or buddha. Yet humans, creatures, demons, and ghosts follow its accord, as do the earth, the netherworld, and even the heavenly gods. To embody opposition while employing accord—this is how opposition gives rise to accord. This is what is meant by "the primordial Dao, which heaven does not defy," and "using the nine without being used by it."

When the primordial Dao is employed in accord, it reverses yang into yin, becoming human, creature, ghost, or demon. Then the gods oppose it, the heavens oppose it, and even the buddhas and immortals oppose it. To embody accord while employing opposition—this is how accord gives rise to opposition. This is what is meant by "the later heaven following heaven’s timing," and "using the six without being used by it." Master Cheng said: "The mind connects with what precedes heaven, yet its application must follow the later heaven; affairs align with what follows heaven, yet their understanding must precede heaven."

The *Wenyan* states: "Who but the sage knows advance and retreat, life and death, without losing correctness?" This rebellion in the Heavenly Palace precisely illustrates the Great Sage’s masterful employment of the primordial Dao in accord. The Peach Orchard is the emergence of the emperor from Zhen within the Kun palace. The three thousand six hundred trees correspond to the six sixes of thirty-six in the Kun palace. The first twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s initial two lines—this is the lower vehicle. The three thousand years for their ripening signify the lesser attainment.

The middle twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s middle two lines—this is the middle vehicle. The last twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s fifth and sixth lines—this is the higher vehicle. The ripened peaches are yang within yin. After this, visiting every three to five days: five days make a *hou*, fifteen days make a *qi*, and three times five is fifteen—this marks the descent of yin qi. Thus, the ripening of the peaches follows heaven’s movement.

The sudden scheme arises at the time when the yang body is about to transform. Removing his cap and robes is the image of *Bo* (Splitting) reaching its extreme. Eating his fill of ripe peaches: yang receives Kun’s yin qi, and yang gradually turns to yin. Returning to steal peaches after two or three days: two and three make five, another *hou*. The Queen Mother sends seven immortal maidens to pick peaches: the later hexagram *Gu* (Meeting) is when six yang lines encounter seven, bringing *Gu*—seven days complete *Gu*, hence the seven maidens.

The Great Sage transforms into a two-inch man, sleeping in the dense leaves atop a great tree—how wondrous! Green leaves form shade; two is a yin line, small is a yin image. Thus, the great becomes small, the odd becomes even, yang transforms into yin. Qian’s first line gains yin and becomes Xun. Sleeping marks the time when yang wanes and yin waxes. Following heaven in concealment is "using the nine" to "see a flock of dragons without a head"—employing hardness with softness, dwelling in ascendance yet concealing it in the beginning.

The lines "Only the clothes and hat were missing, nowhere to be found" and the like all carry profound meaning. The immortal maidens enter beneath the trees to pick peaches: yin gradually advances to strip yang. The first three baskets and the last three baskets—are these not "three days before *jia* and three days after *jia*," simply the first three and the last three? From first to middle, from middle to last, only sparse flowers and fruit are seen, subtly alluding to the time of decline on Flower-Fruit Mountain.

The immortal maidens look east and west, seeing only on the southern branch a peach half-red, half-white. The green-clad maiden pulls down the branch, the red-clad maiden plucks it—such wondrous meanings cannot be fully expressed. The southern direction refers to the peach borne on the northern branch; half-red, half-white marks the moment of near-ripening.

Only this—what meets the eye alone. The green-clad maiden pulls down the branch: green, the true color of yin, inwardly yin yet outwardly yang. The red-clad maiden plucks it: red, the true color of yang, outwardly yin yet inwardly yang. As the branch is lifted upward, the Great Sage awakens abruptly, revealing his true form—this is an unlooked-for encounter, called *Gou*. Pure yang suddenly meets a single yin, the first advance of the feminine. *Gou* arises when heaven’s heart, through *Xun*, receives the first of *Kun* as earth.

Wang Yuanmei said: “When *Bo* descends into chaos, *Gou* arises; when *Gou* descends into chaos, there is no sorrow—only in *Bo* does one fear *Gou*.” For one yin harbors the ambition to contend with five yangs, its vigor truly formidable. Here lies the very origin of the calamity that would disrupt the Peach Banquet. The Great Sage, recognizing the onset of disaster, flies into a rage, exclaiming, “You’ve stolen my peaches!” To steal peaches is to pilfer the profound mechanism of heaven and earth, to rob the creative workings of yin and yang.

Yet when the immortal maidens speak of the Peach Banquet and the Queen Mother’s august decree, of the sages of east, west, south, north, and center—this is clearly the convergence of the Five Phases. And the Great Sage’s primordial qi is its sovereign lord. Perceiving the portent of *Gou*’s beginning, he turns wrath to joy, employing the art of immobilization: “Stay, stay, stay!”—this is *Gou*’s first six, “bound to the metal *ni*.” Like the *ni* that halts a chariot, fastened with metal’s unyielding strength, it arrests firmly to prevent further advance, lest the yielding way entangle him. Here the immortal master, in utmost compassion, has already revealed the wondrous subtlety of commencing the Golden Elixir.

From this, the Great Sage leaps out of the peach garden and directly encounters the Barefoot Great Immortal—this is *Gou*’s first six, “the emaciated pig hesitates.” The pig delights in wood and hesitates, and though emaciated, it must leap and bound; one must prepare deeply, for its force cannot be easily stopped. Thus he devises a plan and transforms at once, assuming the guise of the Barefoot Great Immortal—this is *Bo*’s first six, “stripping the bed at the feet.” Bare feet signify *Bo*: yin is about to encroach upon the yang path, ascending from below.

Rushing toward Jasper Pool to return, no immortals appear, when suddenly a waft of wine fragrance reaches him. Exerting his divine power, he presses against the vats and jars, drinking to his heart’s content—this is *Gou*’s nine-two, “wrapping the fish, not reaching the guests.” Like a fisherman who arrives first, casting a net to catch all; those who come later, though skilled in fishing, cannot match him. Here *Xun* is the white cogon grass, the wrapped fish the beauty of yin things. Yet it is controlled early, lest it reach the assembled guests. In his drunken stupor, he mutters to himself, “Not good! Not good!”

"..."

Wishing to return to his palace to sleep, he takes a wrong step and loses his way—this is *Gou*’s nine-three, “the buttocks stripped of skin, his gait halting and hesitant.” *Xun* is the thigh; three, occupying the upper position, is the buttocks. The first is resented by the second; three, isolated and without support, seeks an encounter in its ambition, thus finding no peace in its place and faltering in its steps. This is the image of being trapped between advance and retreat.

Proceeding to the Tushita Palace, he suddenly awakens to realization: all this time, he had come to seek this elder, yet upon entering, not a soul is to be seen—this is *Gou*’s nine-four, “the wrapped sack holds no fish; misfortune arises.” Four and the first should correspond and meet, but the first has already encountered the second, leaving four unfulfilled. Having lost its destined meeting, it is like a sack without fish—popular favor has departed. The separation is about to begin.

Entering the Elixir Chamber, he sees five gourds, which contain refined golden elixir. Pouring it out, he drinks—this is *Gou*’s nine-five, “wrapping the melon with willow, containing inner radiance; there is a fall from heaven.” Willow grows in fertile soil, yet the wrapped melon remains uneaten. The willow’s binding of the melon is like the five yang forces restraining the initial yin—an effort doomed to collapse. Yet Heaven’s intent is still unfolding; one cannot contend by force. Only by concealing one’s brilliance, keeping inner power hidden, can the Mandate of Heaven be retrieved. The five gourds are the refined golden elixir—nine-five’s veiled radiance lies within, capable of reclaiming the Mandate. This is like a fall from heaven: what was not there suddenly appears. As I seek to consume the golden elixir to forge my destiny, Heaven bestows it freely. Here the immortal master reveals the principle of inner and outer golden elixirs, saving and delivering the world. The meaning of *Gou*’s time is vast indeed!

In an instant, Wukong sobers from his drunkenness, reflecting with unease, “Not good! If I alarm the Jade Emperor, my life will be forfeit. Flee! Flee!”

"Flee! Better to descend to the mortal realm and be a king!" Without retracing his steps, he took the Western Gate of Heaven, using the art of invisibility to escape, returning to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Ah! How wondrous! The world does not recognize the subtlety within these writings, mistaking Wukong’s violation of Heaven’s decrees as mere worldly flight—unaware that this is the Great Sage’s compliance with Heaven’s will in retreat. Ascending to Heaven and descending to the mountain is called the "Heaven-Mountain Retreat." The Great Sage, knowing the excess of yang and turning toward *xun*, five yang suddenly encountering one yin becomes *gou*—*gou*’s perilous momentum cannot be curbed. It is the root of *xun*; the mechanism of retreat; the gradual onset of *pi*; the foundation of *bo*; the inception of *kun*. To fail to retreat at this juncture is to lack awareness of the moment. This retreat is to depart from excess and conceal oneself in the beginning. Thus, the Great Sage’s disruption of the Peach Banquet was not his doing—it was the work of the qi’s course; the immortal maidens’ plucking of the peaches was not the Queen Mother’s dispatch—it was the qi’s course that sent them. All is the doing of *gou*. Thus, the chapter most thoroughly embeds the meaning of *gou*. Knowing the fierce calamity of feminine yin, only by the Great Sage’s compliance in discerning it and opposition in restraining it can the great Dao of primordial Heaven be made clear. Those who critique *Journey to the West*, reducing the Great Sage’s disruption of the Peach Banquet and rebellion in Heaven’s Palace to mere depictions of deluded desires, do grievous wrong! How lamentable! The Great Sage, returning to the mountain to feast, somersaulted back in an instant using the art of invisibility, arriving at the Jasper Pool—where the guests remained unaware—seizing the four great jars and returning to his cave to hold a drinking assembly. Such is the way of stealth and vigilance, soaring in excess yet following the heart’s desire: meeting it, one sees not its head; following it, one sees not its tail. Left or right, all is fitting.

Though the fermented brew had sown the seeds of chaos far and wide, it could still be silently shifted and subtly redirected. The two instances of "art of invisibility" in this passage precisely capture the unfathomable marvel of vanishing without a trace. When the Jade Emperor was informed and dispatched the Four Heavenly Kings with a hundred thousand celestial troops and eighteen layers of heavenly nets and earthly snares, the Great Sage paid them no heed—this is what is meant by "cares and woes cannot burden him, arrows and snares cannot reach him." He flees in name yet does not flee in truth. Who but the Great Sage could abide in such ease and self-possession?

The Great Sage repelled the Nine Luminaries and laughed, saying, "These deeds are indeed real—what do you intend to do now?" For the Four Heavenly Kings and the Nine Luminaries are none other than the *nine in the fourth place* of the hexagram, all yang and unyielding. The Great Sage, embodying *"fellowship with hidden weapons in the wilds,"* dared not rise openly to advance, and thus could oppose the five yang lines without fear—this is the *nine in the third place* of *Fellowship*. When the *nine in the fourth place* clashed with the Great Sage, they fought from dawn till dusk; all the horned demons were captured, save for the Four Vigorous Ones who escaped. The horned demon corresponds to the *top yang of Coupling*—unyielding in the highest position. At that moment, its rigidity had no place to manifest, no position to encounter, and unlike the *nine in the fifth place* of *Fellowship*, which *"contains brilliance and guards it,"* it was seized. Yet the *nine in the fourth place* could not claim full victory, for it bore the image of *"mounting the wall but failing to attack"* in *Fellowship*. The Four Vigorous Ones and the Great Sage correspond to the *nine in the fifth place* of *Fellowship*. Amidst the five yang lines, the central and correct position finds resonance with the *two in the second place*, and thus they could cover the retreat. *"First wailing, then laughing"*—why first wail? The *two in the second place*, separated by the *three* and *four*, could not aid the *five*, hence the wailing, born of private attachment. Later, meeting the *five* unharmed, they laughed—this too was private sentiment.

The Great Sage said, "Why fret? Just guard tightly, eat your fill, sleep soundly, and nurture your spirit." This is the *top yang of Fellowship*, *"fellowship in the wilds,"* where one’s aspirations remain unfulfilled. For the Great Sage harbored a will that spanned Heaven and Earth, yet the times were adverse, cutting him off from humanity and forcing him into reclusion—how pitiable! Reading the words *"nurture your spirit,"* my tears flow like rivers.

**Chapter Six: Guanyin Attends the Banquet to Inquire of the Cause; The Little Sage Displays Might to Subdue the Great Sage**

Wu Yizi says: This elucidates the principle of the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the alternation of prosperity and decline, the great going and the small coming, shifting with the times. It reveals how the Great Sage’s unfathomable transformations, though compliant in their application, never stray from the primordial Dao of Heaven. The passage brims with boundless meaning, encompassing all without a single superfluous word. I know not how the immortal master, when setting brush to paper, could so effortlessly weave such a tapestry, every thread a truth. It is because his Dao had reached its apex, his mind like the vast emptiness, where the transformations of Heaven and humanity are mirrored in his writing. The shallow grasp its shallows, the profound its depths—all depends on the learner’s own attainment. Yet how lamentable that the world has never truly understood!

Guanyin Bodhisattva appears throughout the text, and this passage serves as its guiding thread, revealing the marvel of divine insight. To *observe*—how profound its meaning! To observe is to manifest correctness to others, guiding them toward purity without self-assertion. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"Great observation is above; compliant and yielding, it is central. Correctness is observed throughout the world."* And again: *"Observe the Dao of Heaven, and the four seasons do not err. The sage establishes teaching through the divine Dao, and the world submits."* Below, there is the wish to observe oneself and the people; above, there is no ruler who establishes teaching through the divine Dao. Above, there is the virtue of observing oneself and the people; below, there is the crudeness of childish observation and admonition—this is not divine observation. Divine observation employs yin without revealing it to others, and thus it stands above compliance, worthy of the name *Great Observation*. Why? The Dao of observation is the Dao of Heaven. To observe Heaven’s divine Dao is to silently and subtly operate, teaching through the manifest to reveal the divine—not revealing the divine through teaching. This is the unmanifest power of the divine.

Thus, Guanyin Bodhisattva arrives at the moment when yang wanes and yin waxes, establishing teaching through the divine Dao so that the world submits. Guanyin Bodhisattva is *Great Observation*; attending the banquet is *temporal observation*; inquiring of the cause is *divine observation*. Seeing the banquet in disarray, though celestial immortals were present, none took their seats—this was the gathering of yang’s waning and yin’s waxing. Commanding Hui’an to scout the military situation was the pivotal moment of divine observation. Here, the immortal master first sets forth the image of the *Ding* hexagram, laying the groundwork for the Great Sage’s eventual submission.

The *Ding* cauldron has fire above and wood below, used for cooking and offering to the Supreme Emperor and the sages. The Peach Banquet was such an offering. Yet the Great Sage, though a sage, was not present—this was a failure to partake in the offering, leading to chaos. Was this not a loss of the proper balance and transformation in cooking? This Peach Banquet was a gathering of yin’s ascendancy and yang’s decline. Who but the divine observer, Guanyin Bodhisattva, could discern the cause of this ebb and flow? The trend was inevitable: yin would advance further, and yang would wane further. It was a gathering of *Adversity*, where yang would soon be stripped away. The times compelled it, yet not entirely—ah! The immortal master’s subtle admonition to the world is profound indeed!

For the *Ding* cauldron embodies the secret essence of the Golden Elixir, and thus the immortal master dared not speak of it plainly, instead setting forth this symbol to await the discernment of later generations. He specifically invoked Guanyin’s joined palms in a single offering to reveal the marvelous function of divine observation—knowing that yin was growing while yang was waning, just as petty men advance while noble men retreat, as at the mouth of the Guan River in Guanzhou.

The *Book of Songs* says: *“The old man pours and pours,”* and the following line reads: *“The young lad prances and prances.”* The “young lad” is yin, and he dwells at the mouth of the Guan River. The Manifestly Sage Erlang, True Lord, is the second line of *Kun*’s hexagram. *Kun*’s yin, moving in accord with Heaven, follows a path of radiant display, its power compliant and unfailingly advantageous. At this moment, for the Great Sage, what came before was *Gou* and *Dun*; what followed would be *Pi* and *Bo*.

The six brothers are the six yin lines; the twelve hundred grass-headed spirits are the two sixes that make twelve. The first and second lines show petty men joining ranks to advance, like *“pulling the creeping grass, each after its kind.”* The grass-soldiers form a *Cui* hexagram, an image of thronging and surging abundance. That they *“heed commands but not proclamations”* reveals their insubordinate nature. The divine troops, leading hawks and hounds, appear as nothing but hawks and hounds. The True Lord laughed and said, *“This little sage has come,”* clearly declaring his smallness.

Yet one must contend with him in transformations—how subtle is the meaning of *transformation*! The *Book of Changes* says: *“In *Bo*, the yielding transforms into the firm.”* If yin strips away yang, why speak of *transformation*? Generally, when noble men expel petty men, they denounce their crimes before the royal court and cast them out without hesitation. Thus in the *Guai* hexagram, five yang lines expel one yin, and it is called *Guai*. When petty men expel noble men, their reasoning is unjust and their words unrighteous. They cause yang to dwindle day by day without realizing it is changing, revealing the cunning of their schemes. The subsequent *“one transformation, two transformations, three transformations, four transformations”* are all part of their art.

The Little Sage then said: *“Gentlemen, with your heavenly nets and earthly snares, do not cover the space above.”* Generally, when petty men harm noble men, they first allow them freedom to roam, then secretly exploit their vulnerabilities, leaving no trace. Such is the venom of their plots. The passage where the six brothers are ordered to restrain the hawks and hounds, with their laughter and gestures, vividly portrays the demeanor of petty men. The Great Sage, seeing this, asked with a grin about their origins. Once their roots were revealed, he knew their yin-like adaptability and mutability.

Erlang shook himself and transformed, towering ten thousand *zhang* tall, brandishing the Three-Pointed, Two-Edged Divine Blade in both hands. The second transformation completes the *Kun* hexagram. *Kun*’s yin moves in accord with Heaven, its power and flame filling the sky—this is the natural course of events. Why raise the Three-Pointed, Two-Edged Divine Blade? The word *“point”* clearly signifies a petty man, while the *“two edges”* resemble two lips. It shows a heart without mercy but wielding a weapon of slaughter. With green face and fanged teeth, crimson hair—is this not a ravenous demon? Though the Great Sage’s upright *qi* fills Heaven and Earth, capable of resistance, how could he contend with the grass-headed hawks and hounds rising in pursuit, startling his wings into retreat!

The Great Sage, sensing the great calamity had begun, concealed his golden-hooped staff in his ear and transformed into a sparrow, alighting and perching on a treetop. This mirrors the first line of *Ming Yi*: *“In *Ming Yi*, it flies, its wings drooping.”*

For it coiled its brilliance, feigning no lofty flight; it concealed its tracks, lest its flight be seen. The six brothers raised a clamor together—how fearful it is when petty men, having gained power, bark in unison! Erlang’s phoenix eyes widened into circles—why such widening? For in ordinary times, he feigned restraint, but in haste, his ferocity was fully exposed. Transforming into a starving hawk, he spread his wings to strike—was this not reliance on the sharpness of talons and beak? The Great Sage became a great *ci* vulture, soaring into the sky, which is the line of *Ming Yi*’s six in the fourth place: *“Entering the left belly, one obtains the heart of *Ming Yi* upon exiting the gate.”* For when concealment among the near is no longer possible, one may yet enter the hidden recesses of the left belly. By upholding the virtue of humility and compliance, one attains the heart of *Ming Yi*, exiting the gate to flee far away. The *ci* vulture demonstrates humility and righteousness. Erlang swiftly transformed into a great crane, darting into the clouds to peck—still employing his beak.

The Great Sage plunged into the stream and became a fish, reaching the utmost in concealment. Erlang transformed into an osprey, resembling yet not resembling a green kite—this was a disguise; resembling yet not resembling a heron—this was a private bribe; resembling yet not resembling an old stork—this was feigning age. The Great Sage flicked his tail and fled, resembling yet not resembling a carp—this was following principle; resembling yet not resembling a mandarin fish—this was noble integrity; resembling yet not resembling a black fish—this was true purity; resembling yet not resembling a bream—this was inner rectitude. Erlang lunged forward to peck once more—still using his beak. The Great Sage became a water snake, slithering into the grass, neither viper nor serpent—concealed in the wild thickets. Erlang transformed into a gray crane, stretching forth a long beak like a pair of sharp-tipped iron pincers. Alas!

Erlang ever wielded his beak—yet it was in the end most fearsome. The Immortal Master’s brush, arriving here, unwittingly sets one’s whole body dripping with sweat.

The Great Sage next transformed into a bustard, a creature that thrives in flocks, keeps its ranks, and lives in company without cliques. Erlang, companion to hawks and crows, ought to have welcomed the flock and averted danger—yet he loathed the bustard’s association with phoenixes as a disgrace, and at once nocked his pellet-bow to strike, revealing how the upright and the crooked cannot coexist. But why did he not transform, instead resorting to the bow? In general, when petty men despise gentlemen, they seldom provoke trouble themselves but incite others to strike with pellets and bring harm. In seeming non-transformation lies the most extreme transformation.

The Great Sage seized the moment, rolled down the cliff, and transformed into a village shrine. This transformation’s subtlety, its hidden meaning, eludes the world’s understanding. Some critics praise it as the alchemy of prose; others mock it as a “monkey-headed shrine,” and for centuries none have glimpsed its depths. Truly, the Great Sage’s shrine-transformation is such that few can fathom its rarity.

Why did the Great Sage not transform into something else but chose instead a shrine so manifestly impossible to conceal? And why, of all places to flee, did he transform into Erlang and enter the very shrine he could not enter? The meaning is already plain and evident. To grasp it, one must read the *Hexagram Bo*’s top line: *“The great fruit is not eaten; the gentleman carries it away, while the petty man strips the hut.”*

At that moment, the Great Sage had no path to heaven, no gate to earth; steadfast in tribulation, all yang had dissolved, only the topmost line remained. The gentleman above shelters the host of yin, like a hut. Should the stripping reach its limit and consume the fruit, he would lose his own shelter. In the end, stripping yang is self-stripping. Thus the Great Sage transformed into a hut-like shrine to halt the stripping, then transformed into Erlang to merge with him, then entered Erlang’s shrine to show that the Great Sage’s shrine was Erlang’s shrine, and Erlang’s shrine was the Great Sage’s shrine—thereby making it clear. Hence the words: *“Sir, do not clamor—the shrine now bears the surname Sun.”* To strip Sun’s hut is to strip Yang’s hut; Yang’s hut is Sun’s hut. Thus the great fruit warns petty men not to consume it, and one should follow the times and halt.

Yet the tail was difficult to conceal, standing erect behind as a flagpole—another layer of subtlety. When gentlemen evade peril and withdraw from the world, it is better to act first than last. If all others go first and I alone lag behind, I miss the moment and court disaster. Thus to vanish without a trace is the ultimate withdrawal. To withdraw with the tail exposed leaves traces for prying eyes. Hence the *Hexagram Dun*’s first line: *“Withdrawal with the tail—danger.”* The Great Sage, at the *Hexagram Gou*, withdrew in accordance with heaven’s Dao of concealment, yet even so could not escape the peril of tail-withdrawal. Who recognizes the danger of tail-withdrawal?

The Immortal Master specifically uses the tail to illustrate the peril of tail-withdrawal. Yet withdrawal must not expose the tail, and stripping must not reach the tail. Now Erlang’s stripping has reached its peak above, even touching the tail—he should be warned to halt swiftly and turn back.

The Great Sage’s mouth became the shrine’s gate, fit for offerings but not for pursuit; his teeth became the door leaves, venerable and indestructible; his tongue became the bodhisattva, manifesting from compassion; his eyes became the window lattice, veiling brilliance with obscurity. Erlang sought first to smash the lattice, then to kick in the door leaves—envying its clarity and clamping its mouth shut.

The Great Sage was then in his tiger-transformation, yet the crowd instead raised the demon-revealing mirror, bowing humbly and spitting out slanderous words—an age-old pattern, nothing strange. The episode where he summons Li Hu and Zhang Long vividly portrays the postures of bribery and gluttony; such is the Immortal Master’s artistry in exposition.

Yet the crux lies solely in the Great Sage’s *observing and advancing*, and the Little Sage’s *stripping and coming*. What comes constitutes what goes; what is small constitutes what is great; observation is what constitutes stripping. Thus the sage looks up to observe the patterns of heaven, looks down to examine the principles of earth. Tracing origins and returning to endings, he knows the discourse of life and death. With spirit he knows the future; with knowledge he stores the past—thus he illuminates transformations and practices the workings of ghosts and spirits.

Those of old who skillfully managed petty men always followed the momentum of their expansion, remained still outside affairs, and gradually halted their advance. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: *“Follow and halt them—this is observing the image.”* In the time of stripping, follow and halt to observe heaven’s waxing and waning, the fullness of yin and the emptiness of yang. The gentleman follows heaven’s course and halts. He does not dare to be rigidly upright: following is how he halts, and halting is how he acts. Stripping does not advance; in *Fu*, advancing is favorable—there is no second way. The great fruit is not eaten—this is halting. Why is it not eaten? The fruit is yang. Yang cannot be stripped and advanced by yin; thus when stripping reaches its limit, it turns to *Fu*. Petty men lose their shelter and also follow the times to halt.

This is why Guanyin deploys Erlang: precisely to observe heaven’s course and follow its expanding momentum to gradually observe its halting—not to aid yin in dissolving yang. She does not use the pure vase to strike the Great Sage but has Laozi use the diamond chisel: precisely to remain still outside affairs, follow heaven’s course, and halt the stripping—to halt yin and rescue yang.

Yet stripping and halting are both heaven’s course. Following its stripping and halting it are both observing heaven’s course. In truth, the Great Sage’s observation is his own observation, merely borrowing Guanyin to expound the principle; his halting is his own halting, merely borrowing Laozi to reveal the meaning; his stripping is his own stripping, merely borrowing Erlang to follow its course. In truth, the stripping is not the Great Sage’s own stripping—he merely borrows the Great Sage to clarify heaven’s Dao of stripping.

To reproach others is to have each strip themselves as warning of their peril. Knowing the stripping and following its halt, knowing the following of its halt and its necessary return, knowing its necessary return—thus the Dao is made clear.

Guanyin pressed her palms together and said, “This humble monk requests that Your Majesty accompany the Dao Ancestor to the Southern Gate of Heaven to see for yourselves the truth of the matter.” This is precisely to observe the truth of heaven’s Dao in yin and yang. The Two Sages encircled the Great Sage but had yet to capture him—“the great fruit remains uneaten.” The pure vase was not used, preserving its immaculate clarity so that the body does not engage, a divine observation.

The Bodhisattva asked Laozi, “What weapons do you have?” Laozi replied, “I have, I have, I have.” From his left arm he took down a ring, called the *Diamond Chisel*, also named the *Diamond Noose*. This is the “golden hook” and “jade hook” of the *Ding* hexagram’s sixth line, fifth and top lines. The subtlety lies in the threefold “I have, I have, I have.” For the *Ding*’s fifth line, the hollow center is yellow, representing the ruler as solid. The fifth is empty, taking the second line’s solidity as its own solidity—thus Guanyin asks from her emptiness, and Laozi answers from his fullness.

All things move by their feet, but the *Ding* alone moves by its ears. The sixth line’s hollow center is virtue, forming the yellow ear-hook. Adding ears responds to the second line’s firm hardness. Like threading with a golden hook, it must remain consistent from beginning to end. In steadfastness, it is beneficial—thus solid yet hollow, hollow yet round, forming a ring. The top line’s jade hook, with yang on the left residing in yin, hard yet yielding, is tempered like jade, warm yet solemn. Thus, from the left arm comes the *Diamond Chisel*, gold conjoined with jade.

Why can it noose all things and be called a noose? The fifth line is hollow at its center, and emptiness can contain. The top is the elder, the fifth the ruler—thus it is Laozi. Only Laozi’s emptiness within and solidity without can subdue the upright and halt change. Erlang could not consume the Great Sage’s fruit, but the Great Sage could consume Laozi’s center, striking his heavenly crown and stumbling. Laozi’s following and halting is the Great Sage’s own following and halting. The hound’s bite sent him sprawling again—Erlang’s following and halting is the Great Sage’s own following and halting. The hound is *xu* (the dog), the eleventh earthly branch. The hexagram of the ninth month has *kun* within and *gen* without, following the season to halt. To act against the season is to halt in motion; to follow the season in halting is to move in stillness. The Great Sage’s entrapment and halt is precisely his own halting and movement.

The Seven Sages are the seven yin lines returning from *fu*. Piercing the *pipa* bones so he could no longer transform—this is the *Bo* hexagram. Halting the top line so the great fruit remains uneaten preserves the yang within the fruit to turn and restore *Kai Tai*. It halts where it cannot but halt. The halting without change is the Great Sage’s wondrous use of the primordial, not Erlang’s ability to pierce and restrain him.

Those who study the Dao and can observe its subtleties, who can establish themselves in the formless and wordless, embody Guanyin’s divine marvel—acting in yin without revealing it to others. In observation, the meaning is vast indeed!

The Immortal Master used the Great Sage and Lesser Sage to elucidate the Dao of the Golden Elixir, while I, with the Confucian Dao, elucidate the Lesser Sage and Great Sage, though I have not exhausted its wonders. I cannot but conclude: the Lesser Sage follows heaven and embodies *kun* yin. Viewed through the primordial Dao, in the later heaven it is the male. The Great Sage defies heaven and embodies *qian* yang. Viewed through the primordial Dao, in the later heaven it is the female. To follow heaven is to rebel against the Heavenly Palace; to punish rebellion is to embrace yin softness. Laozi, as the master of harmony, instead aids yin in restraining yang—the Golden Elixir operates in reversal. Thus, how can I speak of its wonders? I merely observe.

**Chapter Seven: The Great Sage Escapes the Eight-Trigrams Furnace; The Mind-Ape is Tamed Beneath the Five Elements Mountain**

Wu Yizi said: This concludes the preceding discussion of the primordial True Unity’s *qi*, which arises from Nonbeing into Being, from Being returns to Nonbeing, from Nonbeing once more emerges, and from this re-emergence attains Supreme Harmony. Supreme Harmony gives rise to *Qian*, *Qian* to *Gou*, *Gou* to *Pi*, *Pi* to *Kun*, and *Kun* to *Fu*—endlessly cycling, beginning anew, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.

The primordial is refined within the later heaven; the later heaven conceals the marvels of the primordial. The Immortal Master revealed these truths to the world through the later heaven’s Eight Trigrams and Five Phases, that people might observe, awaken, and cultivate this singular *qi* to transcend birth and death.

The Ancestor of Unity is Nonbeing; Nonbeing generates the One, and the One extends to Ten. The sequence of yin-yang circulation—One, Two, Three, Four, Five—is the true reckoning. Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten are but their complements. The reckoning culminates at Five, yet Five resides within One, Two, Three, Four; Three and Four reside within Two; and Two resides within One. Grasp the One, and the hundred follow; perform ten thousand virtues, yet never depart from the One. The hundred, thousand, myriad, and billion never stray from One or Five.

Speaking of the numerical flow of the Five Phases: Heaven-One, Earth-Two; Heaven-Three, Earth-Four; Heaven-Five, Earth-Six; Heaven-Seven, Earth-Eight; Heaven-Nine, Earth-Ten. Speaking of the paired reckoning of yin and yang: *Qian*-One, *Dui*-Two, *Li*-Three, *Zhen*-Four, *Xun*-Five, *Kan*-Six, *Gen*-Seven, *Kun*-Eight—none depart from the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, doubling them yields the sixty-four hexagrams; applying them to affairs yields the three hundred eighty-four lines; accumulating them, all things arise. The number one thousand five hundred twenty remains bound to the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams to the Five Phases; the Five Phases to yin and yang; yin and yang to the Supreme Ultimate; and the Supreme Ultimate to Nonbeing. Thus, the Eight Trigrams and Five Phases are ultimately One. The Immortal Master speaks of both, each bearing profound meaning.

When he speaks of the Eight Trigrams, it is that cultivators may observe their roots within the paired trigrams—just as I, in the opening chapter, presented a diagram to verify the Dao. The Immortal Master long ago made this clear. Let us first clarify the purport of the Great Sage’s escape from the furnace.

In the elixir practice, there is the tripod and the furnace: the upper is the tripod, the lower the furnace. The meaning of the tripod was subtly indicated by the Immortal Master in the preceding chapter, lifting the word “observe” to prompt discernment—not through convoluted spirits and gods, nor can its marvels be fathomed. The meaning of the furnace likewise cannot be fathomed through such convolutions. For within the later heaven’s Eight Trigrams lies the primordial *qi*. The Great Sage, with divine insight, grasped its firing times.

Lord Lao, wielding the Central Yellow of the tripod, struck the Great Sage’s primordial spirit to subdue him, relying on Erlang’s true earth and the hound’s steadfastness—like an eagle seizing a hare. Yet without the refining fire’s work, he could not be fully subdued. Nor could ordinary fire or the fire and thunder deities’ flames forcibly tame him; only the true fire of the Eight-Trigrams Furnace could refine him into elixir. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *“There is a natural true firing time—what need for kindling or bellows?”* Thus, the deities of the fire and thunder departments could not harm him; only Lord Lao could lead him away, cast him into the Eight-Trigrams Furnace, and refine the elixir with civil and martial fire.

The Great Sage, entering the furnace, burrowed beneath the *Xun* palace. *Xun* is the eldest daughter, the way of softness—manifesting the image of King Wen imprisoned in Youli. Only through yielding compliance could he unfold the primordial Eight Trigrams, ultimately unharmed. Wind stirred the smoke, scorching his eyes red—yet this revealed injury, while concealing brilliance nurtured obscurity, rightly employing clarity without harm. Hence it is said: *“Later called ‘fiery eyes and golden pupils.’”*

When the firing time was complete, the furnace was opened to retrieve the elixir. Suddenly, a sound arose from the furnace’s head, light blazed forth, and with a crash, the Eight-Trigrams Furnace was overturned. The Great Sage bolted outward like a white-browed tiger or a one-horned dragon—these two images of dragon and tiger now united as one. Lord Lao tumbled headfirst, barely escaping. Alas!

Marvelous, wondrous indeed! Earlier, Lord Lao struck the Great Sage’s Heavenly Crown with the crucible’s handle, causing him to stumble; now, Lord Lao tumbled headfirst while the Great Sage broke free. The former was the Golden Elixir’s compliance within the crucible to form the embryo; this is the Golden Elixir’s reversal from the furnace to cast off the embryo. The immortal master’s verse, *“The Primordial Body perfectly accords with the Prior Heaven,”* precisely depicts the marvel of elixir completion—each word a pearl of wisdom. The most crucial points of discernment lie in the phrases *“styled the First Mystery,”* *“not lead and mercury,”* and *“returning to transformation.”* For the mystery within the Mystery defies exhaustive speech. This is called *“styled the First Mystery,”* yet there remains something beyond; *“not lead and mercury,”* yet lead and mercury are still required. This is said to *“return to transformation,”* yet further transformation remains.

Laozi said: *“Mystery upon mystery—the gateway to all wonders.”* The first Mystery is already so intricate as to elude comprehension, and the second Mystery is even more so. Thus, the immortal master particularly emphasizes the phrase *“greatly disturbing the Heavenly Palace.”* Another verse contains two *“again”*s, precisely capturing the essence of *“Mystery upon Mystery.”* Why, then, did he once more wreak havoc in the Heavenly Palace? When the Prior Heaven’s true *yi*-essence enters the Eight Trigrams, it follows the timing of the Posterior Heaven; when it emerges beyond the Eight Trigrams, it precedes Heaven, and Heaven cannot oppose it. It contends with Heaven for its seat, unbound by Heaven’s dominion.

Earlier, the Great Sage’s disturbance of the Heavenly Palace led to his tempering within the furnace—first movement, then stillness, the initial phase of the work. This is the first Mystery. Now, the Great Sage’s renewed disturbance of the Heavenly Palace, followed by his confinement beneath the mountain, is stillness at its extreme giving rise to movement, and movement returning to stillness—the latter phase of the work. This is the Mystery upon Mystery. Yet while the first disturbance could be subdued by Lord Lao’s crucible, this one could only be quelled by Tathāgata’s palm. The former relied on the oppositional Eight Trigrams, the latter on the clustered Five Phases; though their methods of restraint differ, their wondrous function is one.

Most marvelous are the four lines of another verse. Readers must understand: the ape is paired with the heart, the heart is the ape—tightly bound and securely tethered, allowing no external pursuit. Thus, commentators on *Journey to the West* encapsulate the entire book with the four characters *“heart-ape, intent-horse,”* unaware that the ape is the Dao-body. The ape’s nature is slow, governing stillness; the monkey’s nature is restless, governing movement. This illustrates the Dao-body’s alternation between movement and stillness, corresponding to the human heart’s alternation between movement and stillness—not that the ape and monkey *are* the human heart. When the immortal master’s outline speaks of the *“heart-ape,”* saying the heart is the ape or monkey, the meaning is profound and demands the reader’s discernment.

If the heart is simply the ape or monkey, the expression is plain and shallow—why then the phrase *“profound meaning”*? For the Dao-body has stillness and movement, and the cultivator likewise has stillness and movement. Movement at its extreme must return to stillness, stillness at its extreme must give rise to movement, and movement at its extreme must return to stillness. The entire process of the Golden Elixir is contained herein—this is *“Mystery upon mystery, the gateway to all wonders.”* Hence, it is called *“profound meaning.”*

Why does the third line speak of uniting movement with stillness without mentioning the ape’s heart uniting with intent, but only the heart? Because in the Golden Elixir’s work, at the moment when stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement, one must subdue the monkey’s movement and pacify the ape’s stillness to accomplish the Great Dao. Thus, before the horse and ape unite, before heart and intent harmonize, one cannot be tightly bound and securely tethered but must be guided externally. Only when horse and ape unite, when heart and intent harmonize, can one be tightly bound and securely tethered, allowing no external pursuit.

The Great Sage’s transformation into three heads and six arms, dancing within the core, enduring through all ages, and eluding the grasp of divine generals—this precisely depicts the marvel of the Dao-body’s transformations. Those who interpret this as concerning the heart err greatly. Yet the Dao is no ordinary Dao; those who cultivate and subdue it become Tathāgatas. One must thoroughly investigate its origins before proceeding.

The Great Sage himself declared his spirit’s primordial root-source as the essence of the Prior Heaven, no mundane thing—this alone emboldened him to contend for precedence. In a single phrase, he revealed that while Heaven is of the Prior Heaven, so too is he. Thus, he dared to contend for precedence without yielding.

When the Great Sage was lured into submission, it was precisely the moment for the Golden Elixir’s inception. The five fleshy pillars and a wisp of azure *qi* corresponded to the time when heart and intent clustered the Five Phases. The inscription *“The Great Sage Equaling Heaven was here”* on the central pillar is what the Buddha referred to as: *“Within the cosmos, between heaven and earth, there lies a precious secret in the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidneys, but in the mysterious pass of the single aperture.”* Thus, he could not escape Tathāgata’s palm and remained within the Five Phases.

When the Buddha flipped his palm and thrust him beyond the Western Heaven’s gate, transforming the Five Phases Mountain to press him down, he clearly demonstrated that the path of the Golden Elixir must cluster the Five Phases to crystallize from emptiness. The human heart, attaining this alignment, gains a foundation and does not fall into oblivion. As *The Great Learning* states: *“Know where to rest, and you will be settled; settled, you will be tranquil; tranquil, you will be at peace; at peace, you may act without striving, gradually refining and transcending.”* The chapter’s subjugation of the demonic monkey and the grand assembly to pacify Heaven precisely embodies the principle of settled tranquility and peace.

*The Awakening to Reality* says:
*“Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,
Only with substance can transformation arise.
If the crucible lacks the true seed,
It is like boiling water and fire in an empty cauldron.”*
The Great Sage is the true seed. For activity is the function of non-activity, and non-activity is the root of activity. One must first engage in activity and then return to non-activity to complete the wondrous path of the supreme, utterly real Dao. If one begins with non-activity and pursues stillness and stability, the foundation of life will not be firm, and one will ultimately fall into oblivion.

Should one engage in activity yet fail to transcend, the ground of inherent nature remains unemptied, still bound within the Three Realms. The Perfected Lord of Purple Yang states:

*“At first, with effort, few perceive its worth,
Only when effortless do all acknowledge its grace.
Though effortless seems the wondrous key,
Who knows that effort is the root’s embrace?”*

The one who acts is the Mind-Ape beneath Five Phases Mountain. The one who acts yet abides in non-action is the settled Mind-Ape beneath Five Phases Mountain. Throughout the text, from the monkey’s transformation into a spirit to the final passages where “monkey” recurs without mention of “ape,” it precisely reveals the principle that only after taming the monkey can the ape’s stillness be attained. As for Five Phases Mountain taking root and sealing seamlessly, responding to the breath of mortals—this is the Golden Elixir swallowed into the belly. Hunger met with iron pellets, thirst with molten bronze—both are of the metal class. The ape is metal within water, embodying the principle of like aiding like, is this not the work of nurturing unity and embracing the One?

Thus, observing the Tathāgata’s palm-turning subjugation of the ape, one may awaken to the truth that within the postnatal Five Phases lies the prenatal true essence of the One, requiring no distant quest—easily subdued as the turning of a palm.

**Chapter Eight: The Buddha Composes the Sūtra to Transmit Ultimate Bliss; Guanyin Receives the Edict to Journey to Chang’an**

Wu Yizi says: The first seven chapters elucidate the Great Way of the Golden Elixir, which is cultivated through refining the prenatal true qi of the One. Its alchemical method, origins, firing times, beginning and end, secret techniques for commencement—all are encompassed without omission. Those who study the Dao, through silent observation and careful reflection, with a master’s guidance, may together realize bodhi and ascend to immortality.

The Immortal Master feared that the world’s foolish might believe immortals and buddhas are born, not attainable by ordinary beings through cultivation; or that enlightenment lies solely in the mind, attainable by oneself alone. Thus, the following text presents Xuanzang as an exemplar, and Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng, Sha Wujing, and the Dragon Horse as agents of transformation—demonstrating that immortality and buddhahood are within everyone’s reach, not innate or fixed; that mutual aid, not solitary practice, is the path.

Yet the text’s trials and monsters, its perils and hardships—spanning one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years—may well evoke fear, doubt, and hesitation, leading one to believe such a journey impossible, such tribulations inescapable, such merit unattainable. If so, then *Journey to the West* would become an obstacle, deterring seekers.

The Immortal Master’s intent in writing is to reveal that without true transmission, one faces endless trials and extreme suffering; with true transmission, one attains eternal bliss. Hence the chapter’s theme: *“The Buddha composes the sūtra to transmit ultimate bliss.”* It aims to rescue those undergoing trials with what is most proximate and effortless. For with this sūtra’s existence, one may avoid the remoteness of one hundred and eight thousand miles, the perils of eighty-one ordeals, and the protraction of fourteen years.

The opening chapter’s bold declaration—*“Journey to the West to release from tribulation”*—makes clear that the journey’s purpose is liberation, not the imposition of hardship. Yet the trials and tribulations arise because Xuanzang has not yet received true transmission. One might assume enlightenment comes only after reaching Vulture Peak, meeting the Buddha, and receiving the sūtra. How then does he shed his mortal form and attain realization at Cloud-Soaring Crossing?

It is not known that the Bodhisattva, upon receiving the edict to seek a monk, had already bestowed five treasures, instructed him to subdue his three disciples, and prepared his mount. Xuanzang had secretly received the *Tight-Fillet* incantation. The transmission of the true sūtra had already occurred when the Bodhisattva set forth for Chang’an—there was no need to reach the Western Heaven to attain the Dao.

The text’s insistence on the journey to the West merely points to the source of the Great Way; the one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years illustrate the critical importance of vigilance against danger, the stages of progress, and the firing times. The distance is not inherently far—it arises from insufficient effort in bearing the load, from taking the easy path of haste. Recognizing that one hundred and eight thousand miles are not truly distant, one sees the Dao before one’s eyes; the sudden awakening arrives with a single somersault.

The difficulty is not inherent—it arises from delusion by worldly ties, from the unevenness of leaks and gaps. Understanding that eighty-one ordeals are easily resolved, one finds boundless joy; the greatly courageous need only a single strike of the golden cudgel to conclude them.

The duration is not inherently long—it arises from ignorance of the firing times of medicinal substances and the subtleties of weights and measures. Knowing that fourteen years are not truly long, one may swiftly attain the sūtra; the adept, with the golden fillet’s restraint, is already within my grasp.

Without experiencing the extremity of suffering, one cannot know the truth of ultimate bliss; without enduring the bitterness of extreme suffering, one cannot know the joy of ultimate bliss. Without traversing one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years of remoteness, peril, and duration, one cannot comprehend that nine nines reduce to one nine, two treasuries to one treasury, five thousand forty-eight days to a single firing time.

This sūtra originates from the *Yinfu Jing* and the *Daode Jing*, composed by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. The Immortal Master merely entrusted the Buddha with expounding its teachings, the Tang era with disseminating its practice, Xuanzang with exemplifying its standard, and *Journey to the West* with unfolding its meaning—using allegory to reveal its essence.

If one were to insist that only by journeying to the West to fetch the sūtra, as Xuanzang did, can the Dao be attained, then the ancient past would lack buddhas and immortals, and future generations would be cut off from the seeds of buddhahood and immortality. Such a path would be excessively complex, difficult, and abstruse—unattainable by all—rather than the simplest, easiest, and most immediate Way, accessible to all. This would contravene the Buddha’s compassionate intent in transmitting the sūtra.

The Buddha’s transmission of the sūtra encompasses two wondrous meanings: for those who have yet to attain the Dao, it directs them to journey west like Xuanzang to fetch the sūtra; for those who have already attained the Dao, it guides them, like awakening, to reach the West and return to the Buddha. Though the methods differ, the transmission is one, and the transmission leads to one Ultimate Bliss. The subtlety of the sūtra’s essence lies in the discernment of the enlightened mind—thus, only the divine insight of Guanyin Bodhisattva can truly uphold its practice.

The opening verse speaks of those who meditate in dark contemplation, wasting effort in vain pursuits: like "grinding a brick to make a mirror," it cannot reflect form; like "piling snow for grain," it cannot sate hunger. They toil until old age without achievement, leading the young astray. Such sayings as "a hair swallowing the great sea" or "a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru" are baseless claims—even the "Golden-Headed Ascetic" would but smile in quiet amusement. If one awakens to this truth, they "transcend the Ten Grounds and the Three Vehicles"; if one remains mired in delusion, they fall into the "Four Births and Six Paths," trapped in the wheel of rebirth for ten thousand kalpas, unable to escape.

Who can hear the spring message of the cuckoo’s call at "Cliff of No-Thought" beneath the "Shadeless Tree," suddenly shattering the dawn dream? Thus, the "path to Caoxi is perilous" and impassable; the "clouds of Vulture Peak are deep" and unreachable. Boundless and formless, it defies grasp. Here, the voices of old friends fade into silence—yet know this: amid the "thousand-foot ice cliffs," the "five-petaled lotus blooms," rising transcendent, its fragrance curling through ancient curtains and lingering upon timeworn silks.

If one can "discern the source and flow" herein, they will perceive the Dragon King’s three treasures and may then obtain the elixir, becoming immortal and buddha. How could mere meditation at the gate of Chan ever glimpse its depths? For Chan seeks only within the nature of the essence, neglecting the root of life—wasting endless effort until, in old age, one merges into the great transformation. How lamentable! How pitiful! They neither recognize the affair of the "Mind-Ape beneath the Five Phases Mountain" nor understand the matter of "taming the Mind-Ape beneath the Five Phases Mountain."

Thus, when the Tathāgata returned to the Thunderclap Jeweled Monastery, he addressed all buddhas and bodhisattvas: "With my profound, subtle, and wondrous compassion and prajñā, I survey the Three Realms. The fundamental nature of the root is ultimately quiescent, identical to the emptiness of space, utterly devoid of anything." By "fundamental nature of the root," he means the original face. Though it is difficult to directly enter quiescence, by focusing on the nature of the essence in cultivation, one may, upon attaining the Dao, perceive that the original nature is ultimately quiescent—"identical to the emptiness of space, utterly devoid of anything." "Identical to the emptiness of space" does not mean inert emptiness; "utterly devoid of anything" does not mean absolute nothingness.

The matter of subduing the rebellious monkey is known to none in the Three Realms. This matter is most true and most wondrous, neither quiescent nor inertly empty—it is merely that "names arise with the beginning of birth and death," and the dharma’s appearance accords with this. If one claims the original nature is inherently empty and fails to recognize this matter, then it is not my profound teaching but merely clinging to quiescence, which is quiescence alone.

Laozi said: "The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things." The nameless is death, the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is birth, entering into the Five Phases. The rebellious monkey is "named birth and death’s beginning," its dharma-appearance deviating from the root source of its original nature—thus it cannot escape the Tathāgata’s palm or transcend beyond the Five Phases.

In the Buddha’s Ullambana jeweled basin, a hundred rare flowers and a thousand wondrous fruits are arrayed—this is the "named, mother of the myriad things," the image of returning to the origin after purity. This inquiry is the meaning of the Buddha’s words: "I possess a treasure, hidden within the mountain of form—do any of you recognize it?" Thus, the assembly entreated the Tathāgata to "clearly reveal the root," and the Tathāgata "proclaimed the true fruit," unfolding the wondrous mysteries of the Three and Five. The Chan mind is the bright moon; the true nature embraces heaven—this is the true sūtra of the Three Treasuries of heaven, earth, and spirits.

In sum: the Three Treasuries are but the Three and Five; the Three and Five are but the One and Five; the One and Five are but the One. This One is the direct path of cultivating truth, the gate of true goodness. This sūtra, originating in the West, must await retrieval from the East—only one with the silent observation and secret discernment of a great being like Guanyin can obtain it.

The Tathāgata said: "On this journey, you must tread carefully, not traveling in the clouds but keeping to half-cloud, half-mist, meticulously noting the distance of the path." This means the cultivator must proceed with grounded steps, advancing gradually, not indulging in empty fantasies or skipping stages. Yet one must also be fluid and spiritually attuned, free from attachment, for within it lies the sequence of fire-times and stages of practice—these must be carefully remembered and not transgressed.

Among the five treasures is "a brocade kāṣāya robe." The kāṣāya is the garment of non-defilement. "Brocade" is woven from deep threads of five colors. In the five colors, it is blue, yellow, red, white, and black; in the five virtues, it is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; in the Five Phases, it is metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; in the five relationships, it is ruler-minister, father-son, husband-wife, elder-younger brothers, and friends; in the five directions, it is east, west, south, north, and center; in the five tones, it is gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu; in the five flavors, it is salty, bitter, sour, spicy, and sweet; in the five seasons, it is spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the four seasons—extending to the five officials, five grains, and more, all of which cannot be exhaustively described. Yet all are but the One and Five, all are the treasure of "a single brocade kāṣāya robe."

"A 'nine-ringed monastic staff,' the rings symbolizing the image of perfect completion without end. In the principles of numerology, it is cyclical recurrence; in yin and yang, it is the ebb and flow; in the firing times of alchemy, it is the nine rings; in substance and function, it is the interlocking chain; in the four corners, it is encirclement; in spirits and deities, it is contraction and extension; in Heaven and Earth, it is their efficacy; in life and death, it is beginning and end; in the four directions, it is unimpeded passage; in the unfathomable concealment and revelation, it is wisdom; in adapting to circumstances and responding to opportunities, it is expedient means—all residing within the One and Five, all the treasure of 'a nine-ringed monastic staff.'

These two treasures—one embodying completeness, the other efficacy—are why those who come here with steadfast resolve to seek the sutras may don the robe to escape the cycle of rebirth and wield the staff to avoid harm from poisons.

Then there are the three bands, 'called the *tightening bands*, though identical in form, each serves a different purpose.' There are also the three incantations: 'Gold,' 'Tight,' and 'Forbid.' Gold signifies restraint, the measure of advance and retreat. Through gold’s restraint, none may evade its control. One is used to subdue the Great Sage, employing restraint as the means; another to subdue the Black Bear, using non-greed as restraint; and another to subdue Sudhana, using virtuous relinquishment as restraint. Though their applications differ, the method of tight restraint remains the same. This is the esoteric essence of elixir refinement. When lesser practitioners hear of it, they cannot but laugh in derision, so the immortal master conceals rather than explicates it. Why? Those who cultivate the Dao must purge all worldly entanglements, remaining unstained by even a speck of dust. Gold is the first thing to be restrained—this accords with common understanding, and all would readily accept it as true. Yet few realize that if gold’s primary function were abandoned even for a moment, one would become unrestrained and uncontrollable, unable to guide others into one’s own gate. Thus, gold must be employed first, and restraint must be tight, to prevent the peril of transgression and recklessness. Why? Because gold is something all see and readily assent to, something that catches the eye and stirs the mind. Once the thought of gold arises, the eyes grow dim and the mind agitated, leaving no room for leniency—one cannot but submit to gold’s command. The Perfected One said: 'To seek the treasure of Heaven, one must use the wealth of the world.' This is the esoteric essence. Though gold is of a single nature, its uses differ, and the thoughts it evokes vary, yet the method of tight restraint remains constant. If the worldly abandon restraint and transgress bounds, the sage enacts golden statutes to restrain them—another method of establishing boundaries.

This revelation may strike some as far-fetched, prompting laughter, but observe the passage: 'If he will not submit to your command, give him this band. Once worn on the head, it will naturally take root in the flesh. Recite the appropriate incantation, and he will be brought into my fold.' The meaning is quite clear. Thus, even if one does not begrudge the use of gold, the 'Gold, Tight, Forbid' restraints do not contradict the earlier explanation of common principles. Those who grasp this—devotees at the foot of Vulture Peak, the Golden Summit Immortals, who seek the Dao with unwavering resolve—may attain this state within two or three years. This is the true teaching. Swift attainment of the Dao is indeed possible, though the fourteen-year period is not an immutable term.

Yet among these five items, three remain, still embodying the meaning of Three and Five—this must not be overlooked. From this point, Sha Wujing manifests.

This Sha Wujing is the most essential and wondrous aspect of the elixir path, though readers often misconstrue him. Liu Zongyuan wrote: 'In the mountains of the Western Sea, there is a water so weak and diffuse it cannot bear even a mustard seed, sinking only when it reaches the bottom. Thus it is called *Weak Water*.' Yang Xiong’s *Rhapsody on the Sweet Springs* speaks of 'the eastern glow illuminating the Eastern Sea, the western radiance shining upon the Flowing Sands.' Weak Water and Flowing Sands are actual place names in the Western Regions, but the immortal master employs them as metaphors: the passions are easily drowned, the foundation of inherent nature is hard to stabilize, and one must rely on true earth to solidify it. True earth is true intention; Flowing Sands are earth without constancy. True earth is formless yet pervades the nine palaces. Without it, water, metal, wood, and fire cannot harmonize—its efficacy is unparalleled, hence the name 'Sha Monk.'

As for the title 'Roll-Curtain General,' the 'shattering of the glass goblet at the Peach Banquet,' the 'once every seven days, a flying sword pierces my ribs,' and 'what choice was there but to seek sustenance from travelers'—these seem devoid of meaning, yet profound significance lies within. The curtain separates inner and outer, safeguarding integrity and modesty, yet he carelessly rolled it up without scruple. The 'Peach Banquet' is meant to foster joyous harmony. The 'glass goblet,' formed from a thousand years of distilled water, is the supreme treasure of the West, the sole means of fostering harmony. His lack of sincerity caused him to shatter it, forfeiting that harmony, profaning the treasure, and neglecting his duty—his offense was grave. The 'seven days' mark the return of Heaven’s will. In the quiet of night, reflecting on the hidden recesses of his own conduct, he felt remorse and pain as if pierced by a flying sword. Was he not merely consuming the flesh of the sutra-seekers, becoming a useless demon? His 'nine skulls' symbolize the true earth of the nine palaces, so water cannot sink them. 'The sutra-seeker will find use for them'—their wondrous application will be detailed when he is subdued.

Here, 'taking the sands as his surname,' he is named 'Sha Wujing,' 'enters the *sha* gate,' and 'purifies his mind and cleanses his thoughts, never again harming life.' From this, we know that to take refuge in the Pure Land, one must employ true intention and sincerity, avoiding carelessness that leads to harming life."

For the foundation of long life lies entirely in this earth’s harmonious union. Earth is the essential element in the refinement of the elixir—those who interpret Sha Wujing as pertaining to metal and water fail to grasp the true function of earth and merely speculate in vain.

From this point, Zhu Bajie manifests his form. The pig belongs to *hai*, and within *hai* resides *jia*-wood. Wood can generate fire, hence the term “speech-ability.” The character *hai* (亥) contains *yi* (乙), signifying gestation, and *er ren* (二人), representing male and female. With two heads and six bodies, it embodies the tenth month of pure yin, yet the principle of yang never wholly perishes, thus embodying the ceaseless cycle of generation. Without the harmonious forging and refinement of the golden elixir, it cannot be accomplished.

“Tianhe’s Marshal Tianpeng, having drunk, flirted with Chang’e.” *Peng* (蓬) signifies whirling without constancy, encountering the unpredictable—its nature is crooked yet upright, following righteousness while favoring metal. Wine is water-metal; upon meeting wood-metal, it spins without direction, and even Chang’e is toyed with. His true nature, akin to that of beasts, led him to “take the wrong path” and enter a pig’s womb. *Jia* is yang-wood, *mao* is yin-wood, so he was rightfully paired with the Second Sister of *mao*. “Before a year had passed, she died”—this reflects the principle of yang’s birth and yin’s demise. “All the cave’s possessions became mine to enjoy,” for within *hai*, *yi* gestates and receives emolument from *mao*. “Living by devouring others,” he indulged solely in wine and lust, “harming life” and taking lives, thus becoming a demon. Only when the Bodhisattva enlightened him did he “awaken as from a dream,” accept the precepts in earnest, and “sever the five pungent roots and three corpses,” hence the name “Zhu Bajie.”

From this point, the White Horse manifests his form.

From ancient times to the present, those who revere this tale as a guide take the ape as the heart and the horse as the mind. Yet if one claims the horse is the mind—since the heart is the essence of the mind, and the mind is the function of the heart—then all the wondrous and unfathomable feats, such as "Great Sage Equaling Heaven" wreaking havoc in the Heavenly Palace or the somersault cloud, should rightly be attributed to the White Horse. Why then are they solely ascribed to the ape? This reveals that the White Horse cannot be the mind.

The White Horse is a metal symbol, a dragon-horse. *Qian* represents the dragon and the horse. The horse is a creature of pure *Qian*, embodying the ceaseless vigor of *Qian*. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must emulate the unrelenting diligence of *Qian*, possessing the great strength and burden-bearing capacity of the dragon-horse, only then can they journey to the West and obtain the scriptures. Ordinary horses, lacking such power, are inevitably hindered by Eagle Sorrow Gorge. If the horse were indeed the mind, would not those lesser horses also qualify? Yet why are they devoured by the dragon-horse, necessitating its presence?

However, another crucial principle must be clarified: for those who cultivate the Dao, taming the dragon is the foremost task. If one indulges in reckless abandon, they destroy their own luminous pearl, becoming a malevolent dragon. With unstable roots, how can one bear the Dao or travel far? Therefore, one must retreat into the deep abyss, conceal brilliance, and nurture obscurity, only then can their potential be properly harnessed. From this point, the Great Sage emerges from concealment.

The marvels of the innate true *yi* have been thoroughly expounded earlier, and need not be reiterated. To summarize clearly: wood, numbered three, resides in the East; fire, numbered two, resides in the South. Wood generates fire, and these two elements share the same palace, thus two and three combine to form five. *Wuneng* (*Hai*) unites water and fire as one family. Metal, numbered four, resides in the West; water, numbered one, resides in the North. Metal generates water, and these two elements share the same palace, thus four and one combine to form five. *Wukong* (*Shen*) unites metal and water as one family. *Wu* and *Ji*, inherently the generative number five, form the three fives. *Wujing* embodies the earth family, and the union of the three fives becomes the Supreme Ultimate.

*Tai* signifies the utmost greatness; *ji* denotes the utmost essential. Its principle lies within primordial chaos, and with a single movement, yin and yang are born. Yin and yang are *qi*. This is the principle that gives rise to *qi*, and *qi* in turn embodies the principle. Only with the *qi* of the innate true *yi* can the three families be generated; after the three families converge, they in turn generate the *qi* of the innate true *yi*, forming the spiritual infant. The infant relies entirely on the operation of this *qi* to shed its mortal form and become a true person.

*Xuanzang* is this infant, thus he cannot be separated from *Wukong*; indeed, neither *Wuneng* nor *Wujing* can be separated from *Wukong*. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: “East three and South two together make five, North one and West four share the same. *Wu* and *Ji* inherently reside in the generative number five; the three families converge to form the spiritual infant.” This is the true essence. Alas!

Revealing the Dao to this point,世人 cannot fathom its meaning, inevitably resorting to wild conjecture and misguided speculation, their perverse doctrines and defiled practices reducing the most true and supreme wondrous Way to mere child’s play. Those with the aspiration to study the Dao must swiftly seek a true master, receiving step-by-step guidance to avoid falling into the cycle of rebirth.

In the closing of this chapter, the Great Sage’s four characters—“seeing nature and illuminating the mind”—the word “mind” here precisely strikes at the human heart, echoing the earlier teaching of Patriarch Subodhi: “After attaining the Dao, one must see nature and illuminate the mind.” At the very outset of Daoist practice, to be able to see nature and illuminate the mind is indeed the subtlety of the three vehicles of Chan. Yet if one knows only non-action and not action, this is no more than solitary cultivation of a single yin element—how can the elixir be formed and the sacred embryo achieved? In the end, one falls into emptiness. How lamentable! How pitiful!

Master Ziyang the Perfected says:
*“To see non-action as the essential subtlety is not as good as action as the foundation.”*

Ancestor Shangyang says:
*“To reach old age in non-action, how can one attain joy? Entering the chamber to gather lead—this is called action. In the marketplace of great virtue, who will awaken?”*

To forge the vast expanse, first establish the firm boundaries.
Only when the millet-grain pearl is obtained is one not in error.
Nine years of sitting in forgetfulness—non-action’s merit is vast.
When the three thousand deeds are fulfilled, joy is shared with all.
Yet if one clings to non-action alone, without first engaging in action,
This is but the folly of the deluded, self-bound in attachment!
These earnest words are spoken to enlighten later learners.

For seeing nature and illuminating the mind are the specialized practices *after* obtaining the elixir;
The gathering of the Five Phases is the very foundation of buddhahood and transcendence.
If one only sees nature and illuminates the mind but does not gather the Five Phases,
One will surely fail to escape the cycle of rebirth.

Like the Tang monk who had yet to form the sacred embryo,
Who required the three families to complete its coalescence;
Like Sun Wukong, whose Five Phases were already settled,
Yet still needed to see the Tathāgata to achieve liberation.
When one reads the exchange of gratitude between master and disciple aboard the bottomless boat,
All becomes clear.

**Chapter Nine: Chen Guangrui Meets Disaster on His Official Journey; The River-Flowing Monk Avenges His Origins**

Wu Yizi says: To read without a discerning eye is to bury the ancient masters’ painstaking intent—
Like savoring fine delicacies yet tasting no sweetness,
Or obtaining a piece of Bian jade yet mistaking it for common stone.

Yet how arduous it is! In leisure, I have perused the commentaries and exegeses of classics and histories, parsing their distinctions thread by thread—yet discrepancies abound, and clarity remains elusive. How much more so with this book, whose allusions branch in myriad directions, whose metaphors coil in hidden meanings? For centuries, it has been lumped together with trivial tales and absurd fables, casually dismissed or lightly mocked, serving only as fodder for idle wit.

Alas! To read the books of sages is difficult; to read the books of immortals is even more so! To read the books of immortals without recognizing them as such, yet still seek to grasp their sublime essence—is this not harder still? To read without recognizing their immortal nature, yet strive to reveal their profundities so that all may perceive their transcendent wisdom and, without exception, become immortals themselves—is this not the most arduous task of all?

Take this very chapter: readers may dismiss it as merely recounting the Tang monk’s past, devoid of deeper significance. Its events seem contradictory, at odds with worldly norms and common sentiment, scarcely worthy of belief. Consider the gaudy decorations, the bride-selecting ball toss—rites unrecorded in proper wedding customs.

How could the mother of a *zhuangyuan* be reduced to living alone in a foreign land? Would the daughter of a prime minister lack an escort when assuming office? A prefect’s wife could never secretly appear by the riverside. A single plank as a raft—hardly a sound plan to safeguard an infant. The beloved daughter won by the bride-selecting ball—why would she vanish without a trace? The doting mother of an official in office—how could she become a beggar after parting? Even if constrained by bureaucratic rank, how could there be no promotion for eighteen full years? Though kin and acquaintances may be few, could there truly be no word at all from even the most distant relation? Seeking one’s mother and recognizing her—how could one simply stride into the inner yamen? Pouring out one’s heart so freely—could it be that in a city of such size, with its cold officials and desolate offices, there were no gatekeepers to bar entry, no servants or maids in attendance? And once the scheme unraveled and capture was imminent, how could one muster an army of sixty thousand? Such manifold absurdities weary the reader’s ear. Earlier scholars have often excised this chapter, deeming it dispensable.

Alas! The immortal master’s learning spans past and present; his breast encompasses the workings of creation. He is intimately versed in the ways of the world and human sentiment, in the canons and measures of governance—would he ever wield such a careless brush? Nay, the immortal master’s profound intent and sublime expression lie precisely here, beyond the ken of ordinary minds. For he traces straight to the origins of Xuanzang’s parents’ birth, thereby illuminating the foundational workings of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao. The eighty-one trials of later chapters are rooted in this; the attainment of true fruition is rooted in this. All revolves around saving the golden carp—water giving rise to metal, the principle of inversion and reversal.

Metal can generate water, yet without water, it falls to the butcher’s block and cannot preserve its life. Water can generate metal, and with metal, it connects to the divine and can even revive the dead. Thus, preserving the life of metal is to preserve one’s own life; saving metal from death is to save oneself from death—this is the unifying principle, the very purpose for which Guanyin was sent to Chang’an. Hence, the mother can give birth to the child, and the child can in turn give birth to the mother. Mother and child mutually generate each other, and the alchemical method is complete.

Observe: *"In the Joyous Hall prefectural yamen, a son was born. By his ear, the Star Lord of the Southern Pole whispered, ‘By Guanyin’s dharma-decree, in days to come, husband and wife, mother and child shall reunite. Remember my words well. Awake! Awake!’"* This is meant to awaken the world—how could it be intended for Joyous Hall alone? *"Joyous Hall"* is metal, the product of the mountain’s opening. *"River Flow"* is water, born of metal’s nurturing—metal generates water. *"Secretly cast into the river’s edge"*—metal generates water. *"Flowing straight to Golden Mountain, where the raft came to rest"*—metal generates water. *"Seeking my mother within the Jiangzhou yamen"*—water generates metal. *"Rushing into the residence to rescue his mother"*—water generates metal. *"Xuanzang desperately tearing at the bonds"*—water generates metal.

Yet without discerning the myriad falsehoods of the world, one cannot know the singular truth within water. Only the bodhisattva’s divine insight can faithfully uphold this true decree. Guanyin was sent to Chang’an to enable Chang’an to perceive the great Dao. Alas, Chang’an *"changed its reign title to Zhenguan"*—able only to glimpse the Dao faintly, like a woman’s chastity. With a *Zhenguan* sovereign above, the great Dao could not be perceived; below, with Wei Zheng as minister, the grand vision could not be nurtured. *"Wei"* sounds like *"falsehood"*—falsehood; *"Zheng"* means *"outward verification."* If the vision is chaste but not great, then verification is false and not true. The transformation through reverent inaction is distant, and none in the world can perceive it. This meaning is not my own fabrication—observe how the immortal master prominently introduces the four characters *"Zhenguan Wei Zheng"* at the chapter’s outset, making it abundantly clear.

Now examine the falsehoods in the encounters of Xuanzang’s parents: The selection of the top scholar and appointment to office—Chen Guangrui’s case—yet the one who took office was the bandit Liu Hong. Here lies the falsehood in seeking talent and employing men, plain to see. The daughter of a prime minister resorting to a bride-selecting ball to arrange her own marriage—here lies the falsehood in the proper beginnings of husband and wife, the perversion of marriage rites. An official murdered by bandits, with the brigand’s faction usurping power—rulers and ministers unaware, colleagues indifferent. Here lies the falsehood in the laws of ruler and minister. An official left unpromoted for eighteen years, allowing bandits to tyrannize the people unchecked—here lies the falsehood in the selection and appointment system. Binding a false prefect and commanding sixty thousand troops—here lies the falsehood in military governance and temple calculations. Literature as a ladder to advancement, yet unknowingly becoming a path to destruction—here lies the falsehood in literature. Office as a place to honor oneself, yet unknowingly becoming a road to ruin—here lies the falsehood in fame and achievement. Leaving one’s mother to take office, yet losing all news of life or death; seeking to honor one’s parents yet reducing them to beggary—here lies the falsehood in honor and disgrace. Taking one’s wife along, yet parting in an instant—here lies the falsehood in love and affection. Over many years, parents unable to inquire after their children’s survival, children unable to send word to their parents; kin unable to assist, friends unable to help—here lies the falsehood in family and friendship.

Chen Guangrui gained office and a wife—falsehood. Liu Hong gained office and a wife—falsehood within falsehood. Chen Guangrui gained the favor of ruler and people—falsehood. Liu Hong gained the favor of ruler and people—falsehood within falsehood. Chen Guangrui faced death and life—falsehood. Liu Hong faced life and death—falsehood within falsehood. Lady Zhang had a son yet had no son—falsehood in mother and child. Miss Yin had a husband yet had no husband—falsehood in husband and wife. The Kaishan couple had a daughter yet had no daughter—falsehood in filial piety and compassion.

All this serves as proof that all is false—yet all is also a manifestation of *Zhenguan*. None of it compares to the salvation of the golden-scaled carp. That single act in the water alone could span beginning to end, reuniting flesh and blood in true and tangible fulfillment. The Way of salvation lies solely in the child born of water repaying his mother’s kindness.

Miss Yin, after all, calmly cut her own throat—was this not the *zhen* ("integrity") she beheld? It mirrors the "Zhenguan" ("True Vision") at the chapter’s outset, bringing the core theme full circle. "The monk Jiangliu resolved to settle into meditation"—was this not the *da* ("greatness") he beheld? It reflects back upon Guanyin’s commission to journey to Chang’an, inverting the falsity of *Zhenguan*.

The key lies in one’s spiritual vision and discernment, in seeking the original face before parents were born—that is all.

**Chapter Ten**
*The Old Dragon King’s Foolish Scheme Violates Heaven’s Decree*
*Minister Wei’s Letter Entrusted to an Underworld Official*

Wu Yizi says: Why do people read plain and ordinary words yet dismiss them as strange and unorthodox? It is because their vision is narrow, their steps confined. They see the Rabbit Garden but not the Lacquer Garden; they tread the azure clouds but not the Blue Ox. What they perceive is small, and where they rush is lowly.

In this chapter, the rulers and ministers of *Zhenguan* fail to attain great vision. All their deeds exist only within a dream. No one is without dreams, and none fail to recognize the illusory nature of dreams. None fail to see that worldly affairs are as illusory as dreams—so why, then, do they doubt the Tang emperor and his ministers dreaming of dragons seeking rescue, dreaming of slaying karmic dragons, dismissing it all as absurd and unorthodox?

It is not only the Tang emperor and his ministers who dream such dreams. From ancient times to the present, anyone might have such dreams. Why doubt the emperor’s decree or the minister’s intent at the time, as if they were not all willingly partaking in the same dream?

The emperor says, "I dreamed thus."
The minister says, "I dreamed likewise."
The generals say, "I dreamed likewise."
The officials and attendants—who among them does not say, "I dreamed likewise"?
The entire nation, from ministers to commoners—who dares not say, "I dreamed likewise"?

At such a time, no one of great vision stands forth, robed in solemnity, tablet in hand, and declares: "This is a dream, a wandering spirit’s delusion." One who can perceive the mind and see the nature, who grasps the supreme and truly wondrous Dao, knows that all worldly affairs are illusion—how much more so dreams!

Had the Tang emperor suddenly awakened and said, "Truly, it was a dream," then the dream would not recur. The Jing River would have no dragon without a head; the prime minister’s hall would lack the sword for slaying dragons; the cloud’s edge would not drop a severed head; the city gate would not display a decapitated skull. They would not die in dreams, live in dreams, and dream without end.

Alas, theirs was *Zhenguan*—their vision was small. They believed the dragon had defied Heaven and sought their aid, and so they agreed to save it. They believed Heaven’s punishment was entrusted to them, and so they wielded the blade to strike. Those adept at divining the emperor’s will would surely urge, "You can save it," and thus the hand would move the pieces on the board. Those skilled at aligning with the minister’s heart would surely seize the moment to offer, "You can slay it," and thus the head would hang in the marketplace.

If it is a dream within a dream, awakening is still possible. Within the false, there remains truth—Guanyin saving the dragon with a willow branch is such a case. But if it is not a dream yet treated as one, there is no moment of awakening or revival. Within the false, there is only further falsehood—Wei Zheng sending a letter to Cui Jue is such a case.

Wei Zheng sought to interfere with Heaven’s punishments, and it is clear he would interfere with human punishments as well. He would meddle in the affairs of the underworld, and it is no stretch to see he would meddle in the affairs of the living. Where there is one falsehood, all is false; where there is one sign, all is sign—all wrought by those who cling to "Zhenguan."

The Immortal Master does not mean to disparage Wei Zheng but uses him to expose the illusions of worldly affairs through the ages. There is no sign that is not false, no vision that is not *Zhenguan*. In the final analysis, it is better to be an unranked scholar, a woodsman like Zhang Yu or Li Qiao who can read and has a firm perspective. Their words say:

Those who contend for fame lose their bodies for its sake;
Those who seize profit die for its sake.
Thus, the pursuit of fame and profit by scholars and officials is false, and their striving is but a dream.

Those who receive titles sleep embracing tigers;
Those who enjoy favor run with snakes up their sleeves.
Thus, titles and favor are all false, and their acceptance is but a dream.

They also say:
"Take care on the road ahead, be vigilant—
Tomorrow at the street’s end, few will be familiar."
How sharp and urgent their warning!

Yuan Shoucheng knew the fish would swim into the net, knew fate would violate the year’s decree, knew rain would fall in due measure. Forewarned, he did not enter the dream. The Jing River dragon, deluded by the yaksha, by the broken divination, by the wager, by Marshal Shi, abandoned all caution to vie for victory, defied the law, and acted recklessly—dreaming within a dream, he plunged deeper into the dream.

The Tang emperor dreamed of a karmic dragon seeking rescue and convened his ministers to discuss the strange dream. Wei Zheng dreamed of slaying the karmic dragon and, in the emperor’s dream, left his body to wield the sword. The Tang emperor dreamed the karmic dragon demanded his life, saw ghosts and feared them—all one great dream. The civil and military officials kept night watch at the palace gates to suppress ghosts—all the court was dreaming. Even the Tang emperor’s death and Wei Zheng’s guarantee of his longevity seemed to place the Son of Heaven’s life and death in his grasp. Sending a letter to Cui Jue, he claimed, "In a dream, I once met you," as if the authority of the King of Hell could be swayed by him—was this not the greatest dream of all?

Thus, the Tang emperor tucked the letter into his sleeve and closed his eyes, never to return. This clumsy dragon’s case was a realm of their own making, conjured in the hearts of the Tang emperor and his ministers. Its hidden signs await revelation in later chapters, but its dreamlike nature is no different from the ant in the locust tree or the deer beneath the plantain—all waking illusions.

At first, what strangeness was there? Yet the old dragon’s clumsy scheme was never truly his own; his delayed rain-bringing invited heavenly punishment. Its profound meaning and subtle principles cannot be conveyed in mere words. A poem hints at the intent:

*"Clouds and rain bestow life upon the myriad things—
Take care to act with precision, never tardy.
The clumsy dragon wagered against the mysterious decree,
Drawing the divine blade to follow close behind."*

The *Yin Fu Jing* says: *"Fire is born of wood, and calamity inevitably strikes."* Does this not describe such a case? Today’s temporal masters delude the world with arts of "controlling women and waging battle," inviting ruin upon themselves—just as the *Shi* military advisor taught the old dragon to delay his rain, to wager and compete, defying heavenly judgment. Should we not take heed?

The Immortal Master calls him the *Shi* military advisor—its meaning is clear.

**Chapter Eleven**
*The Tang Emperor Visits the Underworld and Returns to Life;
Liu Quan Presents Melons and Fruits to Reunite with His Wife*

Wu Yizi says: This chapter directly speaks of the Tang emperor’s entry into the dream to illustrate the Dao of yin-yang resonance—even the principle of exchange between man and woman. Where there is stimulus, there must be response; where there is cause, there must be effect, with not even a hair’s breadth of deviation.

Emperor Gaozu of Tang once dreamed of his own death, falling beneath his bed to be devoured by maggots. The Chan master Zhipu interpreted this as a sign of the multitudes rallying to him. The present dream of Taizong is unprecedented. Yet what one does by day, one dreams by night. His journey through the underworld—was this not the hidden truth of the "Zhenguan" era? The evil of hidden truths, conceived in the heart and taking form in dreams—here, one must take "the heart" as the master, for the peril of the human heart is the peril of hell itself. Like a shadow following the body, it cannot be erased.

In this chapter:
Taizong, lost and alone, trembles in terror, unable to find his way. In haste, he sends a private letter seeking refuge. At the Gate of Ghosts, he encounters the late Emperor Gaozu and his brothers demanding their due. He pleads the case of the clumsy dragon. The ledger of life and death is amended. He tours the underworld, heart pounding with dread. Passing through the eighteen layers of hell, his spirit quails. Gazing upon the Bridge of Helplessness, his heart again trembles. Arriving at the City of Wrongful Death, he is seized with terror. A horde of ghosts blocks his path, leaving him nowhere to hide; he begs Cui Pan for rescue and borrows Xiang Liang’s gold and silver to bribe his way free. Witnessing the Six Paths of Reincarnation, the judge urges Taizong to "illumine his heart and perceive his nature." Only when the underworld is free of cries of grievance will the mortal realm enjoy the blessings of peace. Every unwholesome deed may be amended one by one.

Thus, the chapter’s true purport is revealed: if one refrains from unwholesome acts in the mortal world, the underworld will naturally be free of hell’s perils. Every detail is painted from the heart, all drawn from Taizong’s past deeds and the unease they stir within him. Those who critique *Journey to the West* yet overlook this chapter’s focus on the heart are truly baffling.

The most striking moment comes when the wronged souls demand retribution, and the judge says, *"If Your Majesty offers them some money, I can save you."* Taizong replies, *"I came here empty-handed—where would I get money?"* This is what is meant by *"Ten thousand taels of gold cannot be taken, but a lifetime of karma follows you."* When the judge says money can save him, does he truly mean it? No—he means that here, money cannot reach, cannot be used—how then can it save you? Later, when he borrows Xiang Liang’s gold and silver, is this truly a loan? No—it means that in the mortal world, evil deeds bring evil retribution, and good deeds bring good retribution. In the underworld, the thirteen years of an emperor’s reign are no match for the thirteen treasuries of a commoner; the fifteen circuits of an emperor’s governance are no match for the single treasury entrusted to a commoner. The profound meaning lies in the reversal—readers must not cling to the surface!

In later chapters, when Xiang Liang and his wife’s accumulated wealth is revealed to be the fruit of alms-giving and virtuous deeds—not merely gold, silver, or paper money—the truth becomes clear.

Taizong enters the great dream because of the old dragon, and upon reaching the Gate of Ghosts, he should have encountered the ghostly dragon demanding his life. Why, instead, does he first meet the late Emperor Gaozu and his brothers, with no sign of the dragon? The Immortal Master embeds the intent of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* in hidden words. I reveal the unspoken meaning of *Journey to the West* to clarify what the Immortal Master left unsaid.

When the Sui dynasty’s governance faltered, the realm pursued the deer together. Raising the banner of righteousness to overthrow tyranny and rescue the people from fire and water—this was a cause both just and right.

How then could he employ Pei Ji’s cunning schemes, sending palace women of the Sui to attend the High Ancestor? By coercing him with an inescapable situation, he ensnared his father in unrighteousness, transgressing the bounds of filial duty and offending the august will of Heaven. The silent decree of retribution found its accomplices in his ministers and aides, who enabled the plot. The High Ancestor, like clouds moving and rain bestowing, failed in restraint—just as the old dragon was misled by the eel’s strategist. For defying the timely summons and delaying the clouds and rain, fearing celestial punishment and meeting the sword of wisdom, was this not fitting?

The dragon of the Jing River was none other than Li Yuan—hence called "old." The phrase *"rain and water together measured three feet three inches and forty-eight drops"* cryptically encodes the name "Li Yuan." Combining the two characters: three horizontal strokes form three feet, three vertical strokes form three inches, and the four water radicals with the eighteen strokes of *zi* make forty-eight drops. Further, when merged and arranged, they resemble the shape of the character "four," and when calculated separately, yield the number twenty-four (four times six); combined with the three water radicals and the character *ba*, they form another twenty-four (three times eight), totaling forty-eight drops. Removing the three vertical strokes subtracts three inches; removing the *ba* and *zi* from "Li" subtracts eight drops. The remaining strokes of "Li" (一) and "Yuan" (氵) combine to form "Jing." Thus, "Li Yuan" is veiled as "Jing." The dragon lurks in the depths, the old dwells in the turbid—Jing River was indeed his domain.

Yet when Taizong transformed the household into a state, he falsely claimed to rescue his father from peril while failing to avert the decree of Heaven’s justice. Concealing soldiers at Xuanwu Gate, he secretly accused his father of debauchery in the rear palace, then proclaimed his own unrecognized merits, forcing the events of the fourth day of the sixth month—seizing the throne by coercing his father and killing his brother, following the same path as Yang Guang. This was but a continuation of the Sui’s downfall. Guang perished in thirteen years, and Shimin died in thirteen years—was this not fitting?

Moreover, he took the consort of Prince Chaoli and fraudulently fabricated an heir, corrupting the bonds of husband and wife, father and son, brothers and sisters—so thoroughly that even the virtuous Lady Li, who cast herself into the noose to preserve wifely integrity, or Liu Quan, who risked death to present melons and uphold the husband’s authority, were not their equal. Thus, he was right to have the soul of Princess Wang seized, reuniting her in life and death with her kin, allowing husband and wife, father and child, brother and sister to reopen the lotus stem and gather in one chamber.

When Taizong wielded the blade, the bonds of fraternal loyalty were utterly extinguished, leaving no trace to extend to his sister. Such is the retribution of yin and yang, precise to the finest hair. Therefore, the Immortal Master, through Taizong’s own words, declared: *"When I return to the yang world, I shall repay only with melons and fruit."* The "southern melon" (*nan gua*): *nan* (south) is *li* (fire), belonging to the heart. It signifies that as long as the heart’s ground is luminous, the fruit will be the recompense. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"You cast me a quince, I return you a gemmed plum. Not as repayment, but to forever cherish the bond."* Lady Li’s noose and Liu Quan’s melon were the cast quince; Cuilian’s borrowed corpse and Yuying’s descent were the gemmed plum in return. Male and female embody the Dao of yin and yang; gift and reciprocity embody the principle of karmic retribution. To forever cherish the bond is to revive even after death. Compared to those who privately add two years of life or falsely borrow a treasury—though revived, they remain in a great dream—how vast is the difference!

Yet Taizong’s experience was but a dream, not true death. All the visions of hell were self-constructed within his mind. Thus, when his ministers spoke at the moment of returning to yang, they asked: *"What does Your Majesty still find unsettling?"* This is the true record. When the civil and military officials of the Eastern and Western Palaces all memorialized: *"How could Your Majesty’s dream of the former court last so long before awakening?"*—the words *"a dream"* were spoken with utter clarity.

**Note:**

Emperor Taizong ascended the throne at twenty-nine, changed the era name to *Zhenguan*, and lived to fifty-three. He reigned for twenty-four years in truth, not thirty-three. Now, when it is said that the thirteenth year of *Zhenguan* had two years added to it, the matter seems erroneous—yet therein lies a subtle meaning. For Gaozu Yuan reigned nine years, though in reality, it was Taizong’s scheming within the palace that coerced and usurped the throne. Thus, though *Wude* held the empty title, *Zhenguan* had already seized the divine regalia. If the nine years of *Wude* are shifted and added to the twenty-four of *Zhenguan*, does it not make thirty-three years? One and three make two and three; two and three make three and three—three threes precisely yield nine. Hence, the addition of two strokes already conveys the meaning of adding nine years, a stroke of the immortal master’s ingenuity.

Taking the thirteenth year as the time of his journey through the netherworld was to foreshadow the continuation of life after death. Adding two strokes revealed the hidden power of yin usurpation, exposing the concealed disloyalty to his father. Later, when Xuanzang returned after fourteen years, he did so beyond the falsely added years, so Taizong should not have lived to see it. Thus, the thirty-three years of his reign were merely a device to conclude the narrative of his westward journey and the transmission of scriptures for the salvation of the world.

Later generations, in discussing governance, extol the *Zhenguan* era of the Tang, nearly achieving a realm where punishments were laid aside. Yet the great root was already flawed, and all its branches and leaves were but falsehoods—what was there truly to admire? The immortal master used this to expound grandly, urging those who cultivate the Dao to refine their minds and selves in pursuit of the Great Way. If one resorts to deception and fraud, even the slightest unease in the heart is to forge one’s own hell. Thus, the Old Dragon, heeding the advice of his marshal, grew careless and unrestrained—yet could not escape a single sword. The Tang king, seeking Cui the Judge, could not set his heart at ease—and so had two strokes falsely added. Contrast this with Wukong, who set his heart down, stormed the halls of Fengdu, personally expunged his name from the ledger of the dead, and eradicated the ten classes of beings. Though all were dreams, their awakenings differed.

In sum, those who comprehend the Dao and set their hearts down will surely, like Wukong, clearly dissolve the records of death and ascend to heaven. Those who fail to comprehend the Dao and cannot set their hearts at ease will, like Taizong, secretly extend their lifespans—only to descend into the earth. Heaven and hell lie within the heart. Joy and terror both—how can one not be vigilant!

I once traveled to Daliang and visited the ancient Great Xiangguo Monastery. Its monastic halls stood towering and resplendent, with sandalwood relics spread across the fields—no less grand than the Bao Guo Monastery of Yandu. The last pavilion soared high into the azure, inscribed with the name "Sutra Repository." Ascending its layered stairs was like spiraling a conch; four tiers of flying eaves encircled it, crimson railings winding in curves. Gazing downward, all below appeared as ducks and ants, clouds and trees emerging and vanishing, their forms shifting with each step—truly a wondrous sight.

At its center stood a solemn altar, flanked by eight cabinets, their locks and bolts secure, housing the sutras within. In the right corner stood statues of a man and woman: the man with thick brows and a commoner’s topknot, the woman with a purple complexion and bared chest, both beaming with joy. I inquired of the guiding monk, who explained they were the "Water-Selling Lord and Lady." The tales of Taizong’s journey through the underworld, his borrowing of paper money, and his revival to rebuild the monastery aligned perfectly with *Journey to the West*. Examining the stele, I found records of the monastery’s founding, its origins unknown, flourishing in the sixth year of Tianbao during the Northern Qi, and restored under Emperor Ruizong of Tang. Though the annals detailed successive renovations in great depth, they made no mention of the deeds of Lord Xiang and his wife. Yet the couple had indeed contributed to the monastery’s merit. Their statues and the Sutra Repository endured through the ages, proving that the chronicler’s account was not entirely baseless mirages or illusions.

Alas! The two elders, toiling as water-sellers, amassed their wealth with great difficulty, yet delighted in benevolence and giving, never scheming for themselves. Their station was humble, but their vision was vast. Though they may not have fully comprehended the Dao, they glimpsed one facet of the great Way. As Laozi said: *"Putting oneself last, one finds oneself first; losing oneself, one preserves oneself."* Lord Xiang and his wife embodied this. Contrast them with those who hoard wealth and cling to stinginess, perishing in an instant—some even leaving descendants as beggars. What, then, was the purpose of their lives? How lamentable!

**Chapter Twelve: Xuanzang Holds Sincere Convocation—Guanyin Manifests to Transform the Golden Cicada**

Wu Yizi remarked: *"The vinegar fly calls the jar vast; the well-frog calls the sky small."* Yet the jar is not truly vast, nor the sky truly small—it is but the limitation of their view.

This chapter once more invokes the term *"Zhenguan"* to mark the inception of the convocation, revealing it as the *"Zhenguan"* of a woman, not the grand vision of a great sovereign. The governance of Taizong was *"Zhenguan"* indeed, yet Xuanzang surpassed it; the memorials of Fu Yi were *"Zhenguan"* as well, yet Xiao Yu surpassed them—both were, in essence, *"Zhenguan."* When Taizong bestowed upon Xuanzang a five-colored brocade kasaya, it was deemed the height of splendor and imperial favor. Little did he know of the Buddha’s gift of a brocade kasaya and a nine-ringed tin staff, the most resplendent and dazzling of treasures. After the Bodhisattva’s praise, Taizong’s offering paled into insignificance. When Taizong commanded Xuanzang to gather monks for meditation and sutra lectures, opening wide the gates of expedient means, it was called a grand convocation. Yet the Bodhisattva, striking the jeweled platform, cried aloud: *"Monk! You speak only of the Lesser Vehicle—can you expound the Great Vehicle?"* Once the Bodhisattva revealed the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka, it could elevate the deceased to heaven, deliver the afflicted from suffering, cultivate a body of boundless life, and attain the state of neither coming nor going. Xuanzang’s usual teachings, by comparison, could only harmonize with the mundane. Why? For beholding the supremely beautiful, the merely beautiful loses its luster; gazing upon the boundlessly great, the merely great diminishes.

The Bodhisattva manifested her true form of salvation, adorned in majestic splendor. From midair descended a scroll, inscribed: *"In the West lies wondrous scripture,"* and *"Seek the true golden body."* This wondrous scripture of the West is the true Dao of the Golden Elixir. Xuanzang, vowing to journey to the two heavens, was styled *"Tripiṭaka,"* for he embodied the true scriptures of the Three Baskets in one. The name united the Five Phases of the three traditions.

What is *"Tripiṭaka"*? In terms of scripture count: 5,048 scrolls form one *piṭaka*, totaling 15,144 scrolls. In terms of the Five Phases: Metal and Water form one *piṭaka*, Wood and Fire another, and Earth the third. In terms of yin and yang: Heaven is one *piṭaka*, Earth another, and Ghosts the third. Ghosts are the innate efficacy of the two qi, pervading all between heaven and earth. At this point, Xuanzang bore the name of the Three Baskets but not yet their reality—hence, he was called the *"Golden Cicada."* The cicada does not sing with its mouth, drinks but does not eat, dwells in lowliness yet ascends to heights, the most refined of creatures, symbolizing purity, non-action, and a nature that embraces emptiness. Gold is a body tempered through a hundred refinings, radiant and indestructible, symbolizing the luminous emptiness of the nature. Yet though the nature is complete, the root of life remains unsecured—this is the *"towering Buddhist hall with no Buddha within."* Thus, Xuanzang’s grasp of the Lesser Vehicle was but the hollow shell of a golden cicada. Only after the meeting of the three traditions could the foundation of life be fulfilled, forging a body of true, indestructible gold and beholding the Tathāgata—this is the teaching of the Great Vehicle.

Guanyin, sent by the Buddha’s decree, revealed her intent through the five-colored brocade kasaya and the nine-ringed precious staff. Xuanzang, in receiving these, had grasped the Buddha’s decree without remainder. The kasaya symbolized the gathering of the Five Phases; the nine rings, the ninefold return of cyclical refinement—hence, *"manifesting to transform the golden cicada."* Not *"deliverance,"* but *"transformation,"* like timely rain that causes seeds to sprout and burst forth.

Readers of *Journey to the West* may find what follows strange and fantastical, doubting its authenticity. Yet the three disciples to come are the meeting of the three traditions, the medicinal ingredients; the eighty-one trials are the ninety-ninefold return, the firing process. The dispositions of the Five Phases and the numinous power of the nine transformations are inherently mutable and unfathomable. Wherever the brush touches, it reveals true and wondrous forms, the most profound and ordinary principles. Within lie courageous progress, vigilance against peril, and every subtle precept of the Dharma, all fully present. The line *"the Great Thunderclap Monastery of the Western Heaven, the realm of Tathāgata, our Buddha"* is a most revealing declaration. Those with innate immortal bones, if they study this book deeply and discern its mysteries, will receive its teachings as if from a true master, and the treasures of the brocade kasaya and nine-ringed staff may be worn and wielded in this very life.

Yet Xuanzang must first obtain his three disciples before he can pay homage to the Tathāgata—this is easily understood. The three disciples had already attained the Dao of longevity, their life-roots firm and indestructible through ten thousand kalpas. Why, then, did they take Xuanzang as their master? This is difficult to fathom. The reason lies in the shared path of immortals and Buddhas: the Buddha speaks of the *"seven-foot golden body,"* while immortals speak of *"cultivating two persons"*—both are the progression from action to non-action. To perfect life without perfecting nature is like a precious mirror left unpolished, lacking radiance—this is not the true emptiness of action. To perfect nature without perfecting life is like building a house without a foundation, erecting pillars in vain—this is the barren emptiness of non-action. Thus, those who act must first see nature and illuminate the mind before transcending the Five Phases—this is why the three disciples took refuge in the Buddha’s Dharma. Those who do not act must gather the Five Phases before transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—this is why Xuanzang subdued the three disciples.

The three disciples had not fully realized the subtlety of non-action, yet Xuanzang embodied it—thus they took him as their master. Xuanzang had not fully realized the subtlety of action, yet the three disciples embodied it—thus he taught them as his disciples. When master and disciples unite as one, this is the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, the supreme and most authentic Mahayana Dharma. Only after ascending the bottomless boat and shedding the husk do they achieve the mutual aid of master and disciples, where neither owes gratitude to the other—this is the original intent.

The Patriarch said: *"Human life is like a bubble, an illusion. Without this bubble, this illusion, the great matter cannot be accomplished; but once the great matter is accomplished, what use is this bubble, this illusion?"* Ascending the bottomless boat and shedding the husk is precisely when the great matter is accomplished—it is the golden cicada shedding its shell and transforming.

Throughout the book, the master is styled as a "Buddha-child" and named *"Xuan"* (Mystery); the disciples are all "immortal-children" and named *"Wu"* (Awakening). Without awakening, there is no thorough mystery; without mystery, there is no thorough awakening. Immortals are Buddhas, Buddhas are immortals—there is no dual Dao, no dual function.

**Chapter Thirteen: Falling into the Tiger’s Den, the Metal Star Resolves the Crisis; At Twin-Fork Ridge, Boqin Shelters the Monk**

Wu Yizi said: Shun declared, *"The human heart is perilous."* Zhuangzi said, *"What is so impetuous and unbridled that it cannot be restrained? Is it not the human heart?"* Perilous, impetuous, and unbridled—these deeply reveal the treacherous nature of the human heart. The *"Five Sons’ Song"* in the *Book of Documents* says, *"Like driving six horses with rotten reins"*—the six horses are a metaphor for the human heart.

Yet controlling horses depends on reins and bridles, while controlling the heart depends on reverence. Reverence is how the sage begins and completes the Way. Thus, in cultivating the Dao and learning the Way, the very first step upon setting out is to fully restrain the perilous nature of the human heart, lest one fall into its traps.

This chapter marks Tripitaka’s first step on his western journey. The assembled monks debated the purpose, each describing the hardships ahead. Tripitaka said: *"When the heart arises, all manner of demons arise; when the heart is extinguished, all manner of demons are extinguished."* Some say these two lines succinctly capture the entire essence, leaving nothing more to be said.

Alas! To mistake the human heart for the Dao-mind is to mistake the heart for the Dao, to take the false as real—this is a grave error! One must recognize that all within this heart is demonic and must be severed and eradicated at the root. Only through unyielding strength and resolute decisiveness can this be achieved. If extinguishing the heart were the full extent of the purpose, why then journey to the West to obtain the Mahayana true sutras?

This is the blindness of the fleshly eye, failing to recognize the true form of the living Buddha—the wondrous seven-foot golden body. It is like setting out and reaching the border of mountains and rivers, only to take the wrong path and suddenly lose one’s footing, tumbling into a pit.

The chapter vividly illustrates this, for the phrases *"heart arises"* and *"demons arise"* merely point out the perilous nature of the human heart, teaching one to strike first—this is the starting point. Tripitaka mistook these two as the very trap, and his heart’s panic was the tiger’s appearance.

The human heart is like a tiger: the tiger’s trap and the heart’s trap ensnare a person in the same way. What difference is there between falling into the heart’s den and the tiger’s den? How can this be seen?

The concluding verse says: *"The white-browed king of South Mountain."* South is *li* (☲), corresponding to *bing* (丙), and the *bing* fire’s phase of growth begins in *yin* (寅)—the *yin* general. This clearly designates the *yin* general as the heart. Yet fearing that the world might not understand, the text introduces the two demons, the bear and the yaksha, as proof. The bear belongs to fire, born within *yin*; the yaksha belongs to earth, born within *bing*.

The demon king said: *"They delivered themselves to my door."* This entirely depicts the peril of the human heart ensnaring itself.

Yet the human heart is more perilous than the two demons, though not perilous when unified as one. Thus the Mountain Lord said: *"Devour the two, but spare the one—this may be done."* The Golden Star below signifies the original nature of the One. The two are the ordinary heart; the One is the Dao-heart. At this moment, Tripitaka sank into a stupor, lost and without mastery—unable to preserve his life. The way to preserve life rests solely upon the true One’s gold. *"Suddenly, an old man appeared, staff in hand"*—this is the original nature’s mastery, by which life may be preserved. Thus he thanked the old man for saving his life. The old man then asked: *"Have you lost anything?"* Tripitaka replied: *"Two attendants were devoured, and I know not where my luggage and horse have gone."* The old man pointed and said: *"Are not that a horse and two bundles?"* Tripitaka turned to look, and indeed, they were his belongings—only then did his heart settle. Though these seem idle words, they carry essential meaning. For the *"two attendants"* are the ordinary heart, fallen into the trap and devoured; Tripitaka, having beheld the master, retains only the Dao-heart. The *"one horse and two bundles"* symbolize the Dao-heart—his original possessions, unlost, forming the foundation for his westward journey. Only then could his heart be at ease.

The Golden Star led him out of the pit and pointed ahead to divine disciples, further clarifying that with the Dao-heart present, one must steel the heart and press onward. Though others may aid, the path cannot be walked alone to its end. The old man said: *"This is Twin-Fork Ridge, a den of tigers and wolves."* And again: *"Only because your original nature is fundamentally luminous were they unable to consume you."* Such insights are profoundly clear.

Threefold Basket, having encountered tigers and serpents, myriad demonic toxins—though knowing they arose from his own heart—found no means of deliverance. Alone and without recourse, he could only relinquish body and mind, surrendering to heaven’s decree. This was the moment when his original nature, fundamentally luminous, extinguished the human heart and temporarily preserved the celestial heart.

Yet this place was the crossroads where heavenly and mortal realms diverged, leaving him stranded amid towering ridges, neither able to advance nor retreat. The meaning of *"Twin-Fork"* echoed Mozi’s lament at the forked path, where one might turn southeast or northwest—where the White-Forehead King and Liu the Stalwart clashed in battle. Man and beast, vividly depicted, revealed the threshold between humanity and ferocity: only rectitude could dispel evil, only principle could overcome desire. If one could master reverence and self-restraint, cultivate courage and unyielding strength, then the heart’s demons would vanish, and one might feast on flesh and sleep upon hides.

*"Liu"* signified the power to overcome the Yin and halt the slaughter; *"Tai"* (Stalwart) denoted the capacity to contend for leadership and uphold household governance; *"Qin"* (Reverent) meant inner humility and outward dignity, mastering reverence to sustain the self. *"Wielding a rigid fork"* symbolized inflexible strength, while *"styled ‘Guardian of the Mountain’"* signified unshakable composure—reverence resided not beyond the heart but within it, as a fellow villager. The practice of reverence began within filial piety, thus making him a filial son. Only through reverence could he dwell unharmed in the tiger’s den; only through filial devotion could he guard the desolate mountain without peril. Tigers and wolves became his daily fare, for strength sufficed to quell desire; reciting sutras fulfilled his filial duty of deliverance, for sincerity could reach even the unseen. The single word *"reverence"* was the bridge spanning safety and danger, ease and hardship.

Yet he remained bound to the tigers and wolves, unable to transcend the snares of the world; he could only guard this mountain, not venture beyond its borders. Arriving at Two-Boundary Mountain, he escaped fear and obstruction, for here lay the parting of heavenly and mortal paths—he could not press forward as one. This was called *"able to detain the monk but unable to escort him."*

Alas! The mountain lord devoured monks yet detained them, consuming two; the mountain guardian devoured tigers yet detained the monk, preserving one. Yet it was not the tiger that consumed him, but the monk who consumed himself; not Qin who detained him, but the monk who detained himself. As for Twin-Fork Ridge and Two-Boundary Mountain, one must discern: *"Twin-Fork"* as the path where man and beast contend, *"Two-Boundary"* as the way where nature and destiny advance or halt—these distinctions could not be ignored.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Mind-Ape Returns to Rectitude, the Six Bandits Vanish Without Trace**
*Wu Yizi says:* The human heart is like weeds, the Dao-heart like fine grain. If one eradicates all mundane thoughts yet lacks sagely understanding, it is like clearing a field of chaff and barnyard grass—leaving it utterly barren. How then can one repay the debt of hunger? As the Patriarch said: *"If the cauldron lacks the true seed, one merely boils an empty pot with water and fire."*

The *"mind"* in *"mind-ape"* refers to the Dao-heart. The Dao-heart is not the spirit of deliberation within the heart, but the spirit of essence and oneness within the Five Phases. Only by attaining this heart does one possess the true seed, which is why the Lord of Yu specially emphasized the Dao-heart’s subtlety, refinement, and singularity, faithfully holding to the mean’s mystery.

Readers who mistake the human heart for the mind-ape, failing to recognize the Handsome Monkey King as the true seed of essence and oneness, are like those who take a parasitic wasp’s larva for their own child. Yet this heart remains bound to the Five Phases, still the root of birth and death’s cycle. Only by progressing from effort to effortlessness, forgetting both heart and Buddha, dissolving good and evil, does one attain the transcendent transformation of the supreme Mahayana, beyond the world.

The opening verse is the original text of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, each word a mani-jewel—it must be pondered deeply. The line *"To know it, one must master the mindless decision"* clearly points to the profound principle of not clinging to the heart. For the wonder of essence and oneness arises from emptiness, neither heart nor Buddha, but the formless true suchness, the bodiless true appearance—beginning in concentration, ending in utter oblivion; ever beginning, ever ending, indestructible through ten thousand kalpas.

Should one cultivate reverence and refine the heart with utmost devotion, even with the great power of Bo Qin, one may only escape the jaws of the tiger—how could one transcend beyond the boundaries of the realms? Yet this matter is difficult to comprehend, hence the verse twice employs the character "know" to instruct: only by truly knowing can one truly practice.

As when Bo Qin, standing at the Mountain of Two Realms, saw the monkey pleading for rescue and asked, *"How can I discern truth from falsehood?"* The monkey replied, *"It is true! I dare not deceive!"*—echoing the Tathāgata’s vow: *"I now pledge to ensure this matter for you, its fulfillment certain."* At the summit, six characters are boldly proclaimed, and the Monkey Spirit indeed emerges from the cave, bearing a profound principle beyond brush or ink. Only by knowing that the human heart must be extinguished and the Dao-heart must be born—extinguishing the human heart and birthing the Dao-heart—does the cultivation of the Way begin. Thus, rescuing the "heart-monkey" and renaming it *"Pilgrim"* marks the true knowing and the commencement of practice.

The first step in practice lies in subduing the tiger. *"Beyond the Mountain of Two Realms, a fierce tiger suddenly appeared."* This tiger is not the tiger that ensnares the heart within, but the tiger that sustains the body without—hence the words, *"Bring me clothes to wear."* At the sight of the Pilgrim, it prostrates in the dust, unmoving. The tiger’s nature is no longer wild, no different from the heart-monkey’s return to rectitude. Taking a garment becomes as one with the whole. The Pilgrim’s subduing of the tiger is the Tripitaka’s taming of the monkey—its significance is subtle indeed.

When the Venerable Sun boasts of his *"skills in subduing dragons and tigers,"* he foreshadows the subduing of the dragon as the second step. The verse contains the line: *"A hook of new moon pierces the dusk,"* a phrase of exquisite beauty. Readers may pass it by as mere embellishment of twilight’s leisure, unaware that after subduing the tiger, the crescent moon’s form has already taken shape—this must not be overlooked!

When Wukong debates the elder on their ages, he perceives the swift passage of time...

The Tang Monk and the elder trace their shared lineage, seeing self and other as one family. Master and disciples bathe, shedding grime in an instant to renew themselves; seeking needle and thread, they mend their faults even amid haste. All these depict the conduct of one returned to rectitude, yet hold no profound meaning.

But when suddenly six men burst from the roadside, roaring, *"Leave your baggage—or we’ll spare not your life!"*—here, the words *"life"* and *"spare"* carry a subtle truth. Earlier, at Twin-Fork Ridge, before the heart-monkey was subdued, one’s nature remained fundamentally luminous, yet life lacked a true master. Thus, one could only relinquish body and mind, entrusting them to Heaven’s decree. That life came from Heaven. Now, with the heart-monkey tamed, life bears a true seed—hence both *nature* and *life* are spoken of together. *"Spare you and let you pass"* means this life now depends on oneself. Though one may fall from the horse, the heart can rest easy in its affairs.

The heart is fundamentally empty, yet in truth, all things are complete within it. If the eye fixates on private gain, if thoughts arise from the bodily husk, this becomes a *private hoard*. But when one embodies the great and the public, gathering all beings into oneself, this becomes the *public treasury*. To neglect the public treasury while enriching the private hoard is to betray the lord and join the bandits—just as they say, *"You have nothing at all, yet you come back demanding things from us!"*

Thus, when the lord’s virtue is clear and bright, the six offices are harmonious; when the heart’s sovereign is at peace, the six officials fulfill their duties. The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—these are Heaven’s thieves. Men cannot see them, and the heart, lacking a master, is swayed: the eye sees and delights, the ear hears and rages, the nose smells and clings, the tongue tastes and craves, the mind conceives and desires, the body brims with cares. Thus, the bandits run rampant, plundering wantonly, and *nature* and *life* follow in their wake.

As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: *"The six entrances: the eye enters form, the ear enters sound, the nose enters scent, the tongue enters flavor, the body enters touch, the mind enters phenomena."* These six thieves are worldly bandits—all invited in when the master carelessly opens the door.

Wukong recognizes himself as the true master. *"Standing firm in the center"* means neither leaning nor drifting; *"feigning ignorance"* means unyielding strength. Wielding the weapon of wisdom, he extinguishes them all, strips them of their spoils, and repurposes them as clothing and provisions—this is using stillness to quell chaos, truth to vanquish falsehood. Unlike the human heart, which is disturbed by both mind and things, this is truly the thunderbolt’s might. If, in the moment, he had shown the slightest hesitation or mercy, it would have been like inviting thieves in—none escape unharmed. Hence he says, *"If I don’t kill them, they’ll kill you."* This is the thunderous shout of one who has experienced body and mind!

The Tang Monk, unaware of the bandits’ malice, remains ever compassionate, unable to act decisively—this is what it means to *"be unfit for monkhood, unworthy of the Western Heaven."* Thus, through Wukong’s words and deeds, the text portrays the endless harm wrought by a heart without a master.

The Tang Monk, his heart lacking resolve, yet claims *"I’ll decide for myself"*—this is throwing away his life in vain. He has already spoken his own doom; how can he fulfill his destiny? All stems from his inability to quietly observe and discern the unchanging unity of essence—hence Guanyin transforms into an old woman, bearing robes and hat, transmitting the spell, and pointing the way through delusion.

The old woman says, *"These were originally my son’s."* And again, *"My home is to the east; he must have gone there."*

She then says, *"I’ll call him back to follow you."*

Now, Wukong embodies the Dao-heart—he is the Metal Duke. The *Yi* speaks of what is easily let loose yet hard to subdue, easily lost yet hard to find. But since he was originally of my household, merely lodged in the West for a time, his return to the East already shows intent to return. One must recognize the call to *"summon him back!"* Thus, the *Awakening to Reality* says:

*"The Metal Duke was originally the Eastern House’s son,
Sent to the Western neighbor to lodge and take form."*

Recognizing the *"summons,"* he returns to his dwelling to nurture and unite, taking the Maiden as kin—here, the old woman’s guidance is most clear.

The *"gold-embedded flowered cap"* is the Golden Tight Restraint, as previously explained. Now, an embroidered robe is added, along with the *"True Spell of Settling the Heart"*—this depicts the character *"怀"* (to cherish). The robe bears the cap; Metal belongs to the Western Four. To establish the heart and don them—is this not *"怀"*? The meaning of *"怀"* inherently contains the sense of departure, yet returning is already implied. Just as *"cherishing the feudal lords"* makes the realm stand in awe, or *"cherishing the law"* keeps it ever in mind, the Dao-heart naturally abides. Thus she says: *"If he refuses to obey you, recite this spell—he will never dare leave again."* This is the one-word true spell, a truly wondrous formula.

The Dragon King urges Wukong to return to the Sangha, recounting the tale of Huang Shigong—showing that only with an empty heart can one attain the true fruit. The Bodhisattva teaches Wukong to turn back, entering the gate of tight restraint—showing that a single thought can take root. With no regret, one may press forward, and the Great Dao lies within sight.

Yet the Heart-Ape’s return to rectitude is a mutual awakening, not Wukong’s alone. For Wukong, it is the Heart-Ape of action, returning to rectitude by entering Xuanzang’s Buddhist gate. For Xuanzang, it is the Heart-Ape of non-action, returning to rectitude by gaining Wukong’s active Dao-heart.

The *"Six Bandits"* are everywhere beneficial, fully attesting to the Dao-heart. For Xuanzang, they nearly bring calamity—serving as whetstones for tempering. For Wukong, a single staff strike slays them—like gathering provisions for the Dao-path. It is said: *"The Trackless One"*—*"踪"* (track) lies within *"no return,"* while *"无"* (none) lies within *"return to rectitude."* When one returns, all returns; when one is rectified, all is rectified. The Heart-Ape is truly the seed of reality.

**Chapter Fifteen: Serpents Coil at the Mountain, Gods Secretly Protect;
The Eagle’s Sorrow Gorge, the Mind-Horse’s Reins Are Gathered**

Wu Yizi says: The Tai Bai Immortal’s song declares:
*"Dragons emerge from whore-fire,
Tigers are born in water."*

Regarding the Kan and Li of the body: it is clear that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—the principle of yin-yang inversion. The heart is Li, yang, the dragon; the yin within Li is the tiger. The kidneys are Kan, yin, the tiger; the yang within Kan is the dragon. Only by subduing the tiger can the true water within Li descend and follow the dragon. Only by taming the dragon can the true fire within Kan rise and approach the tiger. This is called the *"water and fire intermingling, Kan and Li coupling"*—the first essential step in internal alchemy.

The previous chapter’s work of subduing the tiger was accomplished in the mountains; this chapter’s task of taming the dragon must be sought in the waters. *"Snake-Coiling Mountain"* depicts the body’s internal entanglements; *"Eagle’s Sorrow Gorge"* symbolizes the perilous ford where one is easily drowned.

The *"fiendish dragon suddenly emerges to swallow the horse, then vanishes without a trace"*—showing its elusive leaps and untamed ferocity. *"Old Sun cannot bear his impatience, scolds the master for being a pushover"*—showing that restraint has its methods, while fear and hesitation are of no use.

*"By Guanyin’s decree, the Metal Spirit secretly aids"*—clarifying that quiet observation and discernment reveal the priority of preservation. *"Lifting the tiger’s pelt, calling the loach to return the horse"*—demands vigilant self-mastery, ensuring governance is never lax.

The *"two locked in combat"* resemble the meeting of the Zi and Wu hours. *"Sanzang says: ‘The other day, when you struck the tiger, you claimed to have the skill to tame dragons and subdue tigers—why can’t you subdue this one today?’"* Here, the taming of the dragon is explicitly raised, tightly paired with the previous chapter’s subduing of the tiger.

*"The Traveler arrives at the gorge, churning the waters like the Nine Bends of the Yellow River in flood."* The fiendish dragon, deep in the gorge, sits and lies in unrest. To subdue and still it, one must first rouse and stir it—this is the Daoist formula: *"Flanks bent, waist curved, the Yellow River flows backward."* This is the method of striking and circulating, the key to taming the dragon. Otherwise, if left to its leaps and bounds, the dragon emerges from water, refusing to turn with the mind and heed our command—how then can it aid our Dao?

Only through ceaseless diligence, constant movement and stillness, can the true dragon be tamed. If it burrows into the grass, leaving no trace, it means the heels have rested, and progress halts. Thus, one must earnestly investigate, seeking its tracks and whereabouts, never allowing it to follow its own path and destroy the true mechanism. This is why the Monkey King, in his urgency, recites the spell, and the Earth Spirit reveals the dangers of the gorge.

*"Crows and sparrows dare not fly over, for the water is so clear they see their own reflections, mistaking them for their kin and often plunging in to drown."* This illustrates that those who do not recognize the true dragon in the water and seek to subdue it instead mistake the water for harmless and drown—just as crows and sparrows, ignorant, take their reflections for companions and plunge to their deaths.

Heaven has set this sheer gorge, where even wings cannot cross—yet within lies the Black Pearl, urgently awaiting exploration. How then to begin?

Direct the intent, tightly grasp the dragon’s horns, and bear the weight for distant conveyance. Swallow the white horse, and intent transforms into dragon; transform the white horse, and the dragon dissolves into intent. Follow intent in transformation, and the dragon’s nature becomes docile, obeying the heart’s every desire. Thus, upon seeing the *Bimawen*, control and release come effortlessly.

Yet to subdue the tiger, one must first subdue the ordinary tiger before the true tiger appears. The true tiger has no form—it takes the ape as its form. As when, in the previous episode, the tiger was slain and its skin flayed for clothing. To subdue the dragon, one must first subdue the dragon-like before the true dragon emerges. The true dragon has no appearance—it takes the horse as its appearance. As in this episode, when the horse was swallowed and its hide transformed into scales.

These dragon and tiger reside within the self—it is merely the foundation of inner cultivation. Should one seek to harmonize with the external Five Phases to achieve the Great Dao, then the *shen*-monkey must become the tiger, and the *hai*-pig must become the dragon. One must not cling to the text or fixate on images, mistaking false dragons and tigers and thus blundering blindly in practice.

Why then could the *Xingzhe* not subdue the dragon himself and had to enlist the *Jiedi* to summon the Bodhisattva? For the dragon is a creature of unyielding strength, and only the soft Way can approach it. The slightest impatience or coercion only rouses its nature further—only Guanyin’s effortless mastery can tame it. Just as before, when the tiger was subdued, it was through the effortless power of the floral crown that bound it. Thus, the moment the *Xingzhe* saw the Bodhisattva, he invoked the method of the floral crown to restrain his own demonic impulses. Even the sinful dragon labeled the *Xingzhe* a demon, yet neither could escape the bounds of effortless mastery.

Subduing the unruly arises from effortlessness, yet journeying toward the Spirit Mountain demands action. The Bodhisattva declared, *"Only when you obtain this dragon-horse can you proceed."* From this point forward, true vigorous progress begins. She summoned the young dragon and said, *"When have I ever uttered even half the word ‘Tang’ to you?"* How profound the intent! To remain ignorant of the origins of the scripture quest is to reach a dead end at this juncture. But to grasp its true purpose is to cross this shore and enter boundless prospects.

The Bodhisattva continued, *"That monkey-headed fool relies solely on his own strength and refuses to praise others."* Some say this means he cannot empty himself, making it a demonic obstacle on the path of cultivation. Others claim the *Xingzhe* trusts only his own hasty courage and scorns the wisdom of others’ effortlessness. Neither is correct. This passage reveals the immortal master’s secret essentials of the Great Dao—a subtle method of transmitting the golden needle.

The *Daoist Canon*’s ten thousand scrolls speak only of the Mysterious Pass and the Female Gate. Laozi said, *"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth."* It clarifies the mechanism of yin and yang’s ebb and flow, their union and continuity, the root’s ingress and egress—what else could be the root of heaven and earth? Those who identify the Mysterious Female with mouth and nose, heart and kidneys, are mired in form and cannot speak of *"as if preserved."*

Dong Sijing said, *"Spirit is the convergence of qi."* Cao Daochong said, *"The Mysterious conceals spirit in profound obscurity; the Female harbors qi in harmonious emptiness."* Yu Yuwu stated, *"The two cavities of Kan and Li wondrously unite the two earths, blending spirit and qi without falling into names or appearances."* This comes closest to the truth.

Alas! The subtleties of internal refinement have been exhausted here, yet all speak only of the individual body. It is like crows and sparrows crossing a ravine, mistaking their reflections for companions—inevitably leading to fatal error. How lamentable!

Thus the Perfected One said, *"Do not cling to this body as the Dao,"* for this is the error of *"the monkey’s head stubbornly relying on its own strength."* Again he said, *"Recognize the elixir of immortality in that other realm,"* which is the truth of *"how could one refuse to praise another?"*

The following passage states: *"This time, as we proceed, there will be those who submit. First raise the words ‘fetching the scriptures,’ and without straining the mind, they will naturally yield in reverence."* This profoundly clarifies that straining the mind cannot be spoken of as the Dao, while submission is the means to fetch the scriptures. Straining the mind is solitary cultivation of a single element; submission is the gathering of the Five Phases. It is not attained through empty speculation but arises from the true accumulation of righteousness.

*"The Bodhisattva plucked the small dragon’s luminous pearl and instructed him earnestly, ‘Apply yourself diligently. Only after achieving merit will you transcend the mundane and restore your golden body of fruition.’"* This means that from now on, one must not rely on one’s own brilliance but must exert effort to succeed—take heed not to retreat or regret.

Most wondrous of all is when *"the Pilgrim seized the Bodhisattva and would not let go,"* saying four times, *"I will not go!"* Why? Taming dragons and subduing tigers pertains only to the Kan and Li of the individual body. Even if one has laid the foundation and refined the self, one remains an ordinary mortal—how can this fulfill destiny and transcend the world?

Thus he said, *"The Western Path is so treacherous. Guarding this mortal monk, when will we ever arrive? I will not go! I will not go!"*

Here the passage artfully presses forward to the marvel of the "three families meeting and proceeding together." Every line of the Bodhisattva’s exhortation is spoken in plain truth, without parable. *"Again, she bestowed a fundamental skill—plucking a willow leaf to transform into three life-saving hairs."* How profoundly subtle! The first three pertain to realizing nature, the inner lines of Qian; the latter three pertain to realizing destiny, the outer image of Qian. The first three and the latter three are ultimately the same, until all six lines become pure Qian, forging indestructible true gold—only then is the task complete. Yet the Pilgrim, taking the latter three as nature, truly embodies unfathomable transformation and boundless cyclicality. This is the very essence of great compassion and mercy, the fundamental intent of delivering the world and relieving suffering.

When the Pilgrim and Tang Monk reached the stream’s edge, they saw an old fisherman poling a raft to ferry travelers across. This raft, though substantial, carries the mortal monk to transcend the mundane and realize nature; later, the Cloud-Soaring Ferry, steered by the Guiding Buddha, is the bottomless vessel that ferries the sage monk to realize destiny as a Great Sage. Thus it is said: *"The vast true Suchness ascends the other shore; with sincere heart, nature is realized upon Vulture Peak."* This is the other shore of realizing nature, not the far bank of realizing destiny.

Upon arriving at the village gate to seek lodging, they received a saddle from the Dharma-protecting horse and a whip made of tiger sinew. What he rides is a dragon; what he wields is a tiger—just as they set forth on the path. Hence the words: *"The Bodhisattva bestowed saddle and bridle upon you. Strive diligently on the western journey; take care not to slacken or err."* Some say this signifies the mind-monkey returning to rectitude and the will-horse reined in, resolving seven or eight parts of the matter. Yet this merely glimpses the obstacles of mind and intent, without tracing the inner sanctum of nature and destiny! Such is the *"fleshly eyes and mortal frame, bowing in gratitude yet failing to comprehend—how many past achievements were squandered, provoking the Great Sage’s uproarious laughter!"* These half-hidden, half-revealed turns are most deceptive, hence the remark: *"He truly deserved a thrashing."*

Now, the meaning is clearly expounded: from the tangled heap, the treasure is plucked—pray, let all gather it, and spare yourselves the clout of old Sun’s golden cudgel.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Monks of Guanyin Monastery Scheme for the Treasure; The Monster of Black Wind Mountain Steals the Cassock**

Wu Yizi says: The Great Dao is profoundly subtle, its wonder lying in quiet observation and close scrutiny. With a pair of wisdom-eyes, one perceives that a thousand threads and ten thousand strands are but one affair—lest illusory shadows and empty flowers obscure the true essence and real meaning. These three chapters all prepare for the nineteenth, where Tian Peng is subdued, embodying the essentials of cultivating truth. Fearing that the world would not recognize this, the immortal master raises the banner of *"observation,"* threading it through the three chapters from beginning to end. One must observe both inception and conclusion; this must not be overlooked.

In this chapter, the folly of solitary cultivation of a single thing is made clear, and the perils of cunning and treachery leading to self-destruction must be known. The brocade cassock, a treasure of the heavens, is the color and form of the golden elixir. Only through accumulating virtue and amassing benevolence, radiating brightness and uprightness, honoring teachers and esteeming friends, and guiding through silent enlightenment may one hope for its reward. If one resorts to scheming and deceit, thinking only of oneself and not others, flaunting strength and cunning, and habitually straying into side paths—such are the ranks of wolfish schemers and rat-like thieves. They seek not longevity but hasten their own demise!

Thus, the root of cultivating truth most abhors a scheming mind. Of old, Master Duanmu encountered an old man by the Han River, who embraced a jar to irrigate his garden. Pitying his labor, Duanmu taught him to use a well-sweep. The old man said: *"I have heard that those who employ machinery must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor a mechanical mind. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are no longer whole; when purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit is unsettled; when the spirit is unsettled, the Dao cannot bear it. I am not ignorant of this—I am ashamed to do it."* Duanmu hung his head in shame. The old man continued: *"You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast off your bodily form, and only then may you approach it! If you cannot govern your own person, how can you govern the world? Begone, and do not hinder my work!"* For he detested excessive scheming.

The monk struck the bell and laughed, saying, *"You wouldn’t understand—this is ‘as long as I’m a monk for a day, I’ll strike the bell for a day.’"* He added, *"It was your grandfather Sun who taught me to strike it for fun."* This is what it means to follow conditions and accept one’s lot, to harbor no scheming mind, to play along with the occasion, and to embody the uncontrived delight of Heaven—true joy in forgetting all calculation. This stands in stark contrast to the old monk below, who stirred wicked intentions, with Broad Wisdom and Broad Scheming endlessly weighing gains and losses, each deploying their cunning.

The Dao is not beyond planning, yet there is oneself and others—when self and others are united as one, what one seeks is upright. Seeking uprightness is called *vital impulse*; where vital impulse abides, life endures. But if the old monk sought personal gain at others’ expense, he walked the path of perversion. Walking perversion is called *deadly impulse*; where deadly impulse reigns, destruction follows.

The Dao is not beyond stealing, yet to rob Heaven and Earth, to pilfer the workings of Creation without harm to either side or injury to the whole—this is called *knowing the mechanism*. Knowing the mechanism is *Heaven’s mechanism*; Heaven’s mechanism is spirit. But when the black bear seized the opportunity to stealthily carry things away, this was called *riding the mechanism*. Riding the mechanism is *human mechanism*; human mechanism is demonic. The absence of mechanism appears in spontaneity; human mechanism arises from contrivance.

Like the old monk who, once the cassock was in hand, wept bitterly by lamplight—Broad Wisdom and Broad Scheming’s schemes, fire attacks, and lethal force—this was human mechanism, riding the mechanism, walking perversion, and self-destruction. Yet with a numinous mind at work and seated awareness, hearing the crackle of firewood, he knew harm was afoot. Turning the tables, he ascended to the Southern Heavenly Lad to borrow the fire-repelling cloak, shielding Tang Monk while ignoring the rest. Where fire aids wind, this thing comes from illumination, harmonious yet not initiating—this was knowing the mechanism, Heaven’s mechanism, seeking uprightness to dispel perversion.

In this chapter, the two appearances of *"a honeybee"* devise a method, teaching one to observe closely and quietly, to recognize the error of harming others for personal gain, and the Dao’s counterstrike—how the Metal Duke cannot lack the Wood Mother. Tang Monk’s words, *"Do not compete in wealth with others,"* are the deep concealment of a wise merchant. The crowd’s words, *"You only harm yourself,"* are the self-invited consequences of fortune and misfortune. Though the admonitions are many, none hit the mark. Only by reading this closely can one grasp the art of narrative.

**Chapter Seventeen: Sun the Pilgrim Raises Havoc on Black Wind Mountain; Guanyin Subdues the Bear Spirit**

*Wu Yizi says:* The *Cantong Qi* states, *"Right and wrong pass through the viscera; inner observation yields reflection."* It speaks of the treasure of true yin and true yang, which cannot be obtained merely by scrutinizing the five viscera or scheming in thought. The old monk of the previous chapter, dwelling in Guanyin Monastery, schemed to seize the cassock—this was like inwardly observing the heart and employing the mind to plot. Little did he know that scheming with the mind stokes the heart-fire to a blaze, burning the heart-fire itself. Inevitably, it becomes a vast fire pit; not only does water fail to quell the flames, but the true treasure sinks into the lower field, just as the black bear stole away the cassock. This is the harm of misusing the mind’s mechanism. Thus, the opening laments: *"Cursed be that old skinflint who knew not men, scheming with his heart—today he has only harmed himself."* This is a sobering revelation.

Yet to abandon the method of observing the mind and forcefully direct effort toward the kidneys is to cling to the superficial talk of refining cinnabar and mercury—a mere side door, an external path! This black fellow is none other than the demon of the lower field. The Daoist is his qi, hence named *"Soaring Void"*; the scholar is his essence, hence clad in white. Calling it the *"Buddhist Robe Assembly"* shows they recognize only the name’s surface, not its inner reality. *"Black Wind Mountain, Black Wind Cave"* depicts the color of the Water Palace’s qi; *"iron helmet, black armor, dark robe, black boots"* shape the form of the Kan Palace. The Pilgrim’s entire account aligns with the essential aim of cultivating truth.

Only the line *"He said his body held elixir pills, but seeking them outside is futile toil"* directly condemns those who focus on the kidneys, refining mercury and extraction—an unlawful practice. It closely anticipates the later chapter where Tian Peng’s self-rescue represents the true, original, and natural union. *"The monster and the Pilgrim fought until the red sun stood at noon, then withdrew to eat."* This is the time when kidney qi wanes at noon and heart-blood flourishes, like closing the gate to draft a letter, inviting the venerable Gold Pond. *"Humble one"* denotes subordination; *"Venerable One"* denotes superiority. The meaning is clear.

The bear and black ape belong to fire yet appear as black men—these are the flames of desire within the kidneys; the Gold Pond belongs to wood yet is called the Cinnabar Chamber—this is the lustful fluid within the heart. Each has its season of encounter and can even offer mutual benefit, forming alliances. Drawn together by kindred qi, they say: *"Transmit to him some qi-absorption methods."*

The Immortal Master, fearing readers might misconstrue the previous monk as an impure mind, thus has the Pilgrim transform into a monk to clarify that the monk is none other than the Mind-Ape. *"Entering the cave, observing its couplets, a place of profound stillness and seclusion"*—this originally describes the realm of understanding destiny. Yet those who practice the demonic arts of extraction without comprehending the spiritual union of intercourse fail to know destiny.

After the deception is exposed and battle resumes, victory and defeat remain undecided. The Pilgrim says: *"I’m not much harder—let’s just call it an even match."* For the Pilgrim’s unyielding strength is like true gold, while the bear’s obstinate rigidity is like crude iron. Gold and iron do not merge, their banners and drums perfectly matched. Yet stubborn iron can be transmuted into gold—it simply lacks the alchemy of refinement to be gathered.

Thus, the journey to the Southern Sea to seek Guanyin is introduced, making clear that the method of subjugation must still be sought in the realm of contemplative freedom. Observe the marvel of subjugation: no longer forcing the scholar to slither like a snake, but simply snapping him in two, turning white into a face; no longer allowing the mess of filling earth, but cleaving the head into a cake, transforming black into cinnabar.

*"Seeing the words ‘Crafted by Lingxuzi’ at the bottom of the tray, the Pilgrim laughed: ‘Fortune! Fortune!’"*—for beneath these words lay the mechanism of destiny. Thus, the Bodhisattva seizes the opportunity, using the ploy to reclaim the kasaya. The immortal elixir cannot be formed apart from this, yet its function was misapplied, burying the treasure. Now, employing the very method of the other against himself, there is no need to rekindle the furnace and bell, sparing further toil. Why? True and false differ by but a single thought, yet fundamentally share the same principle. If one can master spiritual transformation, this can become that, and that can become this—this is the harmonizing elixir-head, the subtle workings of destiny in silent communion.

Thus, the Bodhisattva may transform into a demon, and the demon remains the Bodhisattva, revealing that self and other share a single source, never clashing. This sets the stage for the later self-mating of Metal Lord and Original Mother, who cannot bear even momentary separation. The Pilgrim eats the two immortal elixirs first—what is false can be transformed by the true; the Pilgrim then transforms anew—what is true shifts with the false. Transformation is boundless, concealment and revelation unfathomable, one becoming two, two becoming one—all is ultimately nothingness.

The moment the Pilgrim swallows the elixir, the demon is subjugated, demonstrating the principle of responsive spiritual communion. *"Already exited through the nostrils"*—showing the swiftness of transference. *"The Pilgrim, fearing delay, wished to strike him dead"*—this is *"no merit, yet merit lies within merit."* *"The Bodhisattva hastily stopped him, saying: ‘I have use for him elsewhere.’"*—this is *"having use, yet use is no use."*

*"The black man vowed to attain the true fruit; the Bodhisattva touched his crown and administered the precepts. Today, a wild heart is settled, and endless obstinacy is reined in"*—gaining the heart of freedom while restraining the desires of the senses, as circumstances dictate. The kasaya, lost and then recovered, the bear and ape return directly to the great sea, and the Black Wind Cave is transformed into a monastery for the beholder.

Chapter Eighteen: The Tang Monk Escapes Peril at Guanyin Monastery; The Great Sage Subdues the Demon at Gaolao Village

Wu Yizi observes: The *Book of Changes* states, *"Heaven and earth intermingle in misty vapor, and the myriad things transform into purity. Male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things come to life."* It clarifies that yin and yang employ union as their function. When heaven and earth unite, it is *Tai* (Peace); when mountains and marshes communicate, it is *Xian* (Mutual Joy); when water and fire merge, it is *Jiji* (Completion). Sometimes yin seeks yang, sometimes yang seeks yin; sometimes yang stirs and yin responds, sometimes yin moves and yang follows—only then can transformation and generation occur. From flying birds to hidden fish, from moving beasts to rooted plants, each possesses male and female, all following the Dao of one yin and one yang. If yin stands alone and yang is lacking, or yang stands alone and yin is lacking, then the qi of yin and yang becomes isolated and fails to unite—how can generation and transformation arise?

The *Cantong Qi* states, *"If a hen hatches an egg alone, her chick will not be whole."* It also says, *"If two women share a chamber, though their beauty be exquisite, even with Su Qin and Zhang Yi as matchmakers, their hair will rot and their teeth decay—ultimately, they will never know one another."* This principle is abundantly clear.

The Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi fundamentally derives from the *Book of Changes*. Thus, Laozi says, *"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Though it seems to endure ceaselessly, its use is inexhaustible."* And, *"All creatures emerge from it, and wriggling things none fail to follow."* Zhuangzi says, *"Supreme yin is solemn and still; supreme yang blazes and glows."* He also says, *"Though the corpse abides in stillness, the dragon appears; though the abyss is silent, thunder resounds. When the spirit moves, heaven follows."* For yin and yang, movement and stillness, each is the root of the other, and the Supreme Ultimate rides within them.

If one can embody the Supreme Ultimate, then the heavenly gate rests in the hand, and the earthly axis arises in the heart—this is the attainment of immortals, buddhas, and sages. But if a single thought errs, then movement and stillness alike depart from the heavenly principle; thus, the noble person values vigilance in solitude and introspection. If a single affair leans to one side, then movement and stillness alike lose their center; thus, the noble person values the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge. If one cannot investigate things and extend knowledge, but instead clings to one-sided yin or yang, cultivating only a single aspect—how can one become an immortal or buddha and transcend the mundane to enter sagehood?

Chen Niuwan says, *"There is something strange yet stranger still: the affinity of heart and kidney is not Kan and Li."* Yuanduzi says, *"The primordial qi of pre-heaven comes from the realm of emptiness. A single spark of yang essence is hidden within the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidney, but within the mysterious pass of the single aperture."* If scholars do not recognize yin and yang, do not know the proper timing, and cannot return to the source, but instead grope about within themselves, mistaking the flickering, luminous consciousness for the true reality, they will err again and again.

Alas! The Dao cannot be sought externally, nor can it be grasped by groping within oneself. It is profoundly mysterious and difficult to perceive. Those false masters who mislead their disciples, recklessly conjecturing that it is the art of bedroom alchemy or inner elixirs, stray ever further from the truth. The immortal master outlines the essentials, specifically revealing Laozi and Zhuangzi’s lofty and wondrous Dao—hence the name *"Gaolao Village."*

In the previous two chapters: one depicts the heart’s biased movement and the blazing of fire; the other, the kidney’s biased movement and the flaring of qi. Neither is the Dao, but rather calamity. If one mistakenly regards these two as the Dao, one falls into bias and encounters misfortune. Only by departing from this view can one escape this peril.

*"The Pilgrim turned the Black Wind Cave into a Cave of Crimson Wind"*—this is transforming a dark chamber into a realm of light, leaving a land of misfortune to ascend a mound of blessing. As master and disciples journey, spring’s warmth unfolds. The verses with *"mandarin ducks"* and *"butterflies"* depict the scene of paired flight in settled union—an exquisite depiction of yin and yang in harmonious union.

The most awakening moment lies in the passage where the place name is inquired. Wherever the Pilgrim goes, he never treats asking the name of a place as an urgent matter.

Here the repeated questioning is deliberate—if this place is indeed the true domain of Laozi and Zhuangzi, one cannot but investigate it with utmost care. To clarify this point is to *"grant convenience to others and to oneself."*

The subtlety lies in the two phrases: *"asking others brings no pleasure, but asking him yields commerce."* For to ask others is to stray from the Dao of Gao Laozhuang; to ask him, however, reveals the marvel of exchange and transaction. Later, when the Pilgrim sees the demon, he remarks, *"So this is the trade!"*—his heart already comprehends, echoing the earlier insight.

He says, *"This land on the border of the Ü-Tsang kingdom is called Gao Laozhuang."* The crow embodies the essence of the sun; the hare, the essence of the moon. In Ü-Tsang, the hare manifests, and through their mutual resonance, the boundary becomes distinct. The lofty origins of Laozi and Zhuangzi lie precisely here. The revelation that a daughter has *"taken in a demon as son-in-law"* is the very subtlety of their Dao.

To give a daughter in marriage is called *"marrying off,"* while to take a man into the family is called *"taking in."* The Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi excels in managing yin and yang—not by following the natural course, but by reversing it. Proceeding in sequence, ordinary fathers and mothers produce mortal offspring; reversing the process, numinous father and mother give rise to immortals. A woman taking a man as her mate is like the moon receiving the sun’s light to shine. Thus, Daoists use the moon to symbolize the Dao’s essence—its meaning is abundantly clear.

When master and disciples are introduced, the elder states that his third daughter, Cuilan, has taken in a son-in-law from Mount Fuling. *"Third daughter"* signifies the marvel of the youngest; *"Fuling"* suggests blessings as vast as a mound—implicitly evoking the trigram *dui* (joyful maiden) and *gen* (resolute strength). Fearing the Pilgrim’s ugliness, the elder remarks, *"Ugly he may be, but he has skill."* He also notes that the son-in-law’s appearance and conduct are strange. The Pilgrim replies, *"When night falls, we shall see the truth."* All this depicts the worldly habit of judging by outward appearances, unaware that beneath coarse robes may lie jade, or within an old clam, a pearl—hidden within are the wondrous openings to immortality and Buddhahood.

The Pilgrim, weapon in hand, shatters the demon’s barrier and calls out, *"Summon your daughter—is she within?"* The old man calls his daughter forth, who weeps as she describes the demon’s erratic behavior: *"He vanishes like mist, leaving no trace."* One must seek the true form of one’s daughter in solitude and retrieve the whereabouts of one’s son-in-law from the depths of delusion—yet one must not cling to superficial traces and overlook the reversal of husband and wife.

*"The Pilgrim transformed himself to resemble the woman"*—this is not a change of form, but the revelation of his true form. Why? The primordial *yi* qi is metal within water, outwardly yin but inwardly yang. In essence, he is female; thus, in terms of external yin, the Pilgrim becomes the wife—this is principle. Readers, take note: the immortal master explicitly identifies the Pilgrim as female, not as a transformed guise. The subsequent dialogue—feigned illness, sighs, and entreaties—faithfully captures the intimate exchanges of a married couple.

Old Sun as the wife, Old Zhu as the husband—truly a pair heaven-made and earth-matched, a flawless and proper lady. All this is real meaning, though it may appear as playful illusion. When the Pilgrim reveals his identity as the Great Sage who wreaked havoc in Heaven five hundred years prior, Old Zhu immediately recognizes his origins and knows he can be subdued—he flees at once. The Pilgrim pursues relentlessly, like an eagle seizing a hare, like a cat pouncing on a mouse—such is the nature of their bond. *"The karmic tie forged five hundred years ago"*—their union was predestined, unbreakable. Let us proceed to the next chapter for a fuller account.

**Chapter Nineteen: Wukong Subdues Bajie in Cloud Ladder Cave; Tripitaka Receives the Heart Sutra at Floating Pagoda Mountain**

Wu Yizi observes: From the sixteenth chapter at Guanyin Monastery to this Cloud Ladder Cave, the interplay of metal and wood unfolds—the grand workings of true yin and true yang. Only thus does one open the gateways of the heart without falling into emptiness. This is *"true emptiness"*—empty yet not empty, precisely what the *Heart Sutra* means by *"form is emptiness, emptiness is form."*

Hence, the chapter’s outline pairs *"Wukong subdues Bajie"* with *"Tripitaka receives the Heart Sutra"* as a tight parallel. To *"subdue Bajie"* is to receive the *Heart Sutra*. *"Cloud Ladder"* is the chariot of Heaven; *"Floating Pagoda"* is the ladder transcending Earth. Ascending from lower learning to higher attainment, step by step, one moves from effortful action to effortless Dao—this is the ultimate aim.

The Monkey of *shen* belongs to Metal, and Metal engenders Water—west four and north one, together making one-five. The Pig of *hai* belongs to Wood, and Wood engenders Fire—east two and south three, together making one-five. Within these two fives, *wu* and *ji* naturally merge into one-five.

Within yang there is yin; within yin there is yang.
Within generation there is restraint; within restraint there is generation—
what is called "taking turns as guest and host, mutually serving as husband and wife."

In the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases:
Wood and Fire belong to yang and serve as husband;
Metal and Water belong to yin and serve as wife.
The Monkey is wife;
the Pig is husband.

In the inverted sequence of the Five Phases:
within yang lies true yin, which is wife;
within yin lies true yang, which is husband.
The Monkey is wife, yet in truth husband;
the Pig is husband, yet in truth wife.
True yin and true yang find their subtlety in *wu* and *ji*.

Thus it is said: the essence of the three and the five wondrously converges and coalesces.
The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: "The Way of the noble person begins with the relationship between husband and wife; at its utmost, it is discerned throughout Heaven and Earth."
If one grasps the word *"utmost"* as the utmost of exhausting one’s nature and fulfilling one’s destiny, enlightenment is already present in that very understanding.

Ordinary people do not follow the central Way, stubbornly clinging to partial yin or partial yang. Blindly cultivating and recklessly refining, they neither recognize the Dao nor attain it—
how pitiable, how lamentable!

At the chapter’s opening, "flames coalesce to manifest form"—the Pig embodies the vital essence of the Southern Dipper’s generative *qi*, the radiant hue of the Li Palace. The "nine-toothed iron rake" marks the yang number reaching its apex at nine, the very image of true yin; its operation turns with the rake, entrusted entirely to the *qi*-mechanism of bearing and movement.

Old Pig’s account of his self-rescue mirrors Monkey’s own self-narration, with phrases like "pairing yin and yang," "dividing sun and moon," "harmonizing dragon and tiger," and "drawing in the Golden Crow" all distilling the marrow of the Nine-Cycled Great Return Elixir. When Monkey engages him in fierce battle yet does not immediately subdue him, instead withdrawing their forces to their respective sides, he subtly highlights the three characters "Gao Family Village" to redirect attention to the original theme—why? Lest the world mistake victory in battle for true excellence, unaware that the highest good lies in subduing others without fighting! Here, the Dao of the Golden Elixir reveals itself as no mere art of seductive song.

Monkey recounts how "Tian Peng descended to the mortal realm, having mistakenly entered the wrong womb, yet his numinous nature remained intact." He adds, "For a celestial deity to take such a son-in-law hardly tarnishes the family’s reputation." This shows the upright *qi* of yin and yang, incomparable to mundane malevolent spirits, thus setting up the following line: "It’s only that there were no matchmakers or witnesses to mediate." Why so? The union of husband and wife depends entirely on go-betweens; without them, natures fail to harmonize. This is precisely what the *Cantong Qi* means by "those without shared speech are no kin." Thus Monkey resumes the challenge, declaring, "You don’t resemble one who forcibly seizes another’s daughter without matchmakers or witnesses"—his intent directly foreshadowing the water monster Sha Monk as the go-between ahead, while here planting the notion to elucidate how marital discord arises from such causes. Profound and intricately woven, this meaning is unparalleled. Yet readers dismiss it as mere banter, casually glancing past, burying its depth.

Monkey pressed further, inquiring whether the rake was truly from Squire Gao’s household. Pig boasted of it as iron personally forged by Lord Lao, bestowed by Laozi himself—both claims truthful. "Yet it could not so much as scratch my scalp," for wood cannot overcome metal. Upon hearing of the journey to the Western Heaven to seek the scriptures, Pig relinquished his rake. Why? Having received Avalokiteśvara’s clear decree, he knew that clinging solely to the rake was a one-sided attachment, incompatible with attaining true fruition—what is called "abandoning the self to follow others" rather than relying solely on one’s own strength. Thus he said, "Why not have spoken sooner of the scripture-seeking matter, instead of relying on brute force to batter at my door?" This precisely echoes the moment when Monkey subdued the young dragon, when the bodhisattva remarked, "That monkey-head relies entirely on his own strength and refuses to praise others."

With sincere resolve, Pig burned his den, surrendered his weapon, bound himself, and pledged allegiance—for wood, by nature compliant and righteous, yearns for metal, just as crooked wood submits to the carpenter’s line to be made straight. Within these eight verses, the principles of metal and wood generating and overcoming one another are expounded, as are the dynamics of guest and host in harmonious exchange. When husband and wife are not estranged, their natures and dispositions remain unopposed—this is the very inception of the Western Paradise’s bliss.

Upon their return after subduing Pig, Squire Gao recognized his son-in-law, and Tripitaka rejoiced in gaining a disciple, bestowing the name "Eight Precepts." With evil cast aside and rectitude embraced, a feast could now be prepared to celebrate their reunion. In what follows, "Eight Precepts seized Squire Gao, inviting my humble wife" reveals how hard it is to sever karmic ties; "Monkey and Eight Precepts drank the vegetarian wine" shows how easily one succumbs to fermented brews; "Accepting a single thread, ten thousand kalpas of cultivation are undone" illustrates the heavy burdens of material gain; "If the scripture quest fails, I’ll return to be a son-in-law" exposes the fragility of the resolve for the Way; and again, "Lest some mishap occur, the monk’s vows be broken, the wife’s marriage be lost" reveals the futility of blind, misguided practice. Every line is a child’s song of admonition—do not dismiss it as mere idle jest.

The three disciples took their leave and set forth toward the west. The verse within—"With harmony of disposition and settled nature, all conditions converge; when the moon fills the golden flower, the hair is shorn"—its first line alludes in passing to the recruitment of Eight Precepts, while the second heralds the reception of the *Heart Sutra*. For once Eight Precepts was subdued, the golden elixir took form, and so, having passed the border of Ü-Tsang, they encountered the Bird’s Nest Chan Master. Why? The sun west and moon east mark the division of the twin orbs’ illumination...

The crow hidden in darkness, the hare revealed in light—these are but the radiant interplay of a single qi. When conditions converge and the moon waxes full, this is the true essence. The luminous moon of Chan mind may thus be verified. This *Heart Sutra* scroll appears precisely here, like the crow concealed within the moon, bright and unstained. In its transmission of secret truths, it points the way through delusion—here lies the crux.

Tripitaka bowed and inquired about the road ahead. The Chan Master replied, "The path is long, and the journey’s end will come, but demonic miasmas are not so easily dispelled." Thus he bestowed the *Heart Sutra*, for it alone could dissolve such afflictions. Yet the sutra held no direct signpost to the Western Heaven, so he concluded, "This is the comprehensive scripture of true cultivation, the gateway to Buddhahood."

Tripitaka, still grasping for answers, pressed further about the way to the West. The Chan Master had already made it plain, saying, "Ask that acquaintance of yours—he knows the road west." Monkey, understanding, gave a cold laugh. "No need to ask him—ask me instead." Tripitaka failed to grasp his meaning.

The exchange that followed—Tripitaka seizing Monkey’s words—was the very question he sought to ask. Monkey said, "He insulted my brother and me." This was a veiled answer to the road west. Tripitaka replied, "He spoke of the western path—when did he insult you?" One took it as an insult pointing the way; the other heard only directions, not abuse. Master and disciple, question and response—all was Chan subtlety, every word a revelation. One must awaken swiftly.

Monkey said, "You wouldn’t understand: ‘A wild boar carrying a load’—that was an insult to Eight Precepts. ‘An old stone monkey of many years’—that was an insult to me. How could you possibly grasp his meaning?" To say *"You wouldn’t understand"* was to demand understanding; to say *"How could you grasp it?"* was to demand comprehension.

The Chan Master’s words—*"He knows the road west"*—were a charge to Monkey to relay the message. Monkey’s *"Ask me instead"* was his acceptance of that charge. All was already clear.

Eight Precepts said, "The divine master knows all past and future." He had spoken plainly enough. "But let’s see if his words—‘You’ll meet water monsters ahead’—prove true." Ah! How wondrous!

Oh, how profound! Though many demonic miasmas lie ahead on the journey, why single out only the phrase *"water monsters ahead"*? In the mouths of those two, the great road to the Western Heaven was already laid bare—why should Tripitaka ask further?

In Chapter Twenty, *"Tang Monk in Peril on Yellow Wind Ridge, Pig in the Vanguard at Mid-Mountain,"* Wu Yizi says: This passage makes clear that once one has received the *Heart Sutra*, one must act swiftly, lest one mistake the mind for the Dao and thus obstruct one’s own progress.

The opening verse speaks of the practitioner of the Dao having a method—one that arises from the mind and is extinguished by the mind. But who is it that gives rise to the method, and who extinguishes it? One must discern this clearly for oneself. If one claims that all is but one’s own mind, then why rely on the words of others? One need only apply effort to the mind itself—yet this is like trying to twist iron into blood, to knot the void into form, and to expect effortless attainment. Such a path is utterly impossible. This is to mistake the thief for one’s own child—how could one ever reach the state where both mind and dharma are forgotten?

One must recognize that there exists an immortal elixir beyond such delusions. Do not let it deceive you. First, see through the five phases, shatter all obstacles with a single blow, and strive until the mind becomes no-mind, whereupon the dharma will naturally cease. Only then is it like the autumn moon in a clear sky—undivided, with both nature and destiny fulfilled.

If one claims that the mind is already the Buddha yet fails to recognize that it is neither mind nor Buddha, misinterpreting the verse *"Since all is already the mind, why rely on the words of others?"* as a command to rely solely on oneself, has one not strayed from the true gate? Thus, the text begins: *"This verse is how Master Xuanzang awakened to the* Heart Sutra *and opened the gate."* If the mind were truly the Dao, and the Dao required nothing more, why speak of merely *"opening the gate"*? Why would he still journey westward to seek the true scriptures? Are the true scriptures of the Western Heaven not the teachings of others? This reasoning is clear and awakening!

The *Cantong Qi* says: *"Qian and Kun are the gates of the* Yi."* Wukong and Wuneng are the gates of the *Yi*, and thus the gates of the *Heart Sutra*. To attain Wukong and Wuneng is to open the gate. Only then can one proceed with cultivation and enter the inner sanctum.

Earlier, Chan Master Crow’s Nest, fearing that Tripitaka did not recognize the gate of the *Heart Sutra*, pointed to the *"wild boar"* and the *"old stone monkey,"* prompting Monkey to speak. The Elder understood the meaning, and so he recited and contemplated it constantly. A single spark of numinous light shone through—clearly the realm of *"the setting sun conceals the fire mirror, the rising moon reveals the ice wheel."* The Great Dao lies ahead; one must press onward swiftly.

If one merely gropes within one’s own mind, mistaking the luminous and ever-aware consciousness for the true reality, unaware of the great road to the Western Heaven, one is like a ghost clinging to home—what is this but a *"home-clinging ghost"*? How can one transcend the mundane? Thus, the ancients mocked those who preserved their youth and dwelled in the world yet could not shed their shells and ascend, calling them *"corpse-clinging ghosts."* Their folly is much the same.

When Monkey says *"your family’s ghost,"* he scorns all those who cling to the mind in their practice. Tripitaka says: *"Wuneng, if your heart were still so heavy with attachment to home, you would not have left it. You should return."* Though these words seem to reproach the fool without remorse, was Monkey truly slandering the idiot? No—he was using the fool to illustrate how clinging to the mind in cultivation is like leaving home yet still longing for it.

Observe how the fool *"comes with a dead heart, resolutely"*—to come with a dead heart is still a method of the mind, yet to apply effort, one must have skill. But if one has only a dead heart without skill, every step will be thorny, and the path forward will be blocked. Thus, the old man shakes his head and waves his hand, saying: *"You cannot go to the Western Heaven; you cannot obtain the scriptures."* Yet when Monkey reveals his true abilities, the old man says: *"You must have some skill."* And again: *"With such skill, you may yet reach the West."* This is the wondrous truth of Laozi and Zhuangzi.

Thus, the old man is made the master. The subsequent passage—*"south of the village, two young men with an old woman, three or four children"*—is but a shadow, the esoteric essence of Laozi’s *Daode* and Zhuangzi’s *Nanhua*, a tale that startles the foolish and shocks the vulgar, yet is the great skill for reaching the West.

When Pig mentions *"back in Gao Village, I often terrified mortals,"* he exposes the truth of those who are startled by ghosts and spirits. When Monkey laughs and says, *"Don’t speak nonsense—tidy up that ugliness,"* he speaks of transforming the coarse into the wondrous.

Later, the offering of tea, the inquiry into lineage and age—all foreshadow the perils of Yellow Wind Ridge, implying that only one with great skill like Sun Wukong can proceed. The hungry ghost who eats half a bowl of rice yet remains half-full illustrates the vast distance to the West, showing that only one with an unshakable resolve like Zhu Bajie can bear the burden.

For the mind is not the Dao. If one insists that the mind is the Dao and seeks it solely within the mind, one binds the mind with the mind and blocks the path—like the tiger demon of Yellow Wind Ridge, who tricked Golden Cicada and bound him to the wind-stilling stake. Why? The wind is *xun* wood, yellow is the center, and when they obstruct the heart and chest like a towering ridge, the tiger demon’s stubborn delusion is like the mind’s endless fixation.

See how the tiger demon *"clutches his own chest, flays his skin, and stands by the roadside"*—every detail vividly depicts the character *"heart."*

Thus he roared: “We are none other than the vanguard of the Yellow Wind Great King’s forces!” For to cling to the mind as the Dao is to be deluded mid-journey, blocking the path ahead. *"Pig chased the demon into the jagged rocks and drew his twin blades of red copper."* The "jagged rocks" signify the stubborn, tangled impurity; "twin blades," the discordant duality; "red," the mind’s true hue; "blades," the mind’s unyielding endurance. Thus the tiger demon, as the mind’s obstinate grip, serves as the mountain’s path-blocking vanguard—what need for further explanation? Pig, wielding the resolve of a dead heart, becomes the trailblazer halfway up the mountain, striking first with a single crushing blow.

Observe how *"Sanzang panicked and recited the *Heart Sutra*,"* while the demon, equally flustered, deployed the *"golden cicada shedding its shell"* ruse—now transforming into a tiger, now flaying its skin—all revealing how this mind, refusing to die, twists and turns, becoming its own demon. The moment true mindfulness arises, it is the very instant the wind carries him away. It is not the tiger demon using the golden cicada to seize the golden cicada, but the golden cicada itself using the golden cicada to seize the golden cicada. *"Clasping the Tang Monk in both hands to present him to the Great King"* and *"binding him in the rear garden"*—all are acts of the Tang Monk’s own doing, self-offering, self-binding, his mind ensnared in poisonous harm, beyond liberation.

Pig and Monkey saw through the tiger’s skin as the cicada’s discarded shell, recognizing the trap. One stood guard, the other fought, pressing straight to the demon’s cave. Monkey exerted himself and vanquished the tiger demon; Pig seized the moment and crushed it with a single strike of his rake. This is to first eliminate the mind’s obstinacy, shattering the barriers of true emptiness. Only then can one uproot the demon’s roots and rescue the golden cicada’s wholeness. Such skill is like a harmonious couple, one leading, one responding, inner and outer aiding each other in principle—what household difficulty could remain? Thus the verse concludes: *"When the Dharma Master meets demons in distress, / Temperament in harmony subdues the chaotic fiends."*

This passage begins with *"Dharma"* and ends with *"Dharma Master,"* while the next chapter’s outline immediately follows with *"Dharma Protection,"* clearly illustrating the method of cultivating truth, its subtle foreshadowing and hidden threads like a gray snake in the grass—those with keen eyes will surely see through it.

**Chapter Twenty-One: Dharma Protection Establishes a Manor to Detain the Great Sage; Mount Sumeru’s Lingji Subdues the Wind Demon**

*Wu Yizi says:* This continues the preceding discourse. Having extinguished the self-aggrandizing gaze of the tiger, one must still sweep away the rat’s head with its many forks. For when the mind possesses *shishen* (discerning spirit) yet clings to self-reliance, it is dazzled by brightness and loses clarity, dispatching illumination yet failing to illuminate—its harm lies in discernment that does not discern. To recognize that *shishen* is not true is to realize that the non-spiritual in spirit is true. Hence it is said: *"To refine spirit, refine the non-spiritual spirit."*

Scholars who fail to grasp the intent of *"non-spiritual spirit"* may scrutinize minutiae and spawn demons, or plunge into deep doubt and multiply delusions. Some drift into heterodox paths, others waver between two possibilities—all are blind cultivation and reckless refinement, called *"wild blindness."* Han Yu said: *"One who cannot discern the grounds of gain and loss is called wild."* When spirit does not guard its abode, the illness lies in the heart, like a violent wind shaking without stability. Confucius said: *"To speak without observing another’s countenance is called blindness."* When heart-fire attacks the liver and assaults the eyes, it is like the Yellow Wind blowing and wounding the injured.

Thus, long-held stagnation breeds vermin, and accumulated delusion multiplies hardships—all stem from lack of clarity, leading to endless entanglement. This is why the *Rites* warn against *"hesitation"* and the *Book of Documents* values *"decisiveness."* To transform hesitation into decisiveness lies in nothing but clarity. Yet clarity still does not depart from *shishen*—it is the eye-opening medicine, most urgent and precise.

In this passage, the ophthalmologist serves as the great eye, while Lingji Bodhisattva is the one who, after applying the eye-opening medicine, reveals radiant illumination. Dispelling the fleeting glimpses of confusion and awakening the unobscured wondrous vision, one stabilizes the wild, erratic wind and severs the rat’s two-pronged hesitation. The rat’s nature is thievish and suspicious; it emerges from its burrow indecisively, always wavering between two ends. Thus the old demon is an ancient rat spirit from the foothills of Vulture Peak.

Observe how *"the old demon lowered his head in silence, pondering a scheme,"* and upon hearing the words, *"grew even more vexed, saying, ‘This fool knows nothing!’*”*

“I never ate his master—yet he struck down my vanguard in turn.” Such are the words of one without steadfast vision, who instead faults others. “The old demon scrutinized carefully and saw that the Traveler’s frame was coarse and stunted, not even four feet tall”—this was belittlement born of blindness. “The Traveler said, ‘You whelp, you’ve no eye for true measure!’”—this was mockery to his face. “With a single blow to the head, he grew six feet, then stood a full ten feet tall.” For the four great elements compose a body, which inherently possesses the true form of ten feet—never to be judged by outward appearance or superficial likeness.

“The Traveler revealed himself and devised a plan, but the old demon mistook the feint for substance. The two fought outside the cave, the Traveler employing the art of ‘a body beyond the body.’” Thus, with many defenses confounding the senses, the eyes grew dazzled and disordered, and so harm befell them. “The old demon unleashed his yellow wind technique—using madness to counter delusion—how could heaven and earth not darken? Thus his assault targeted the eyes.” This passage expounds that chaos cannot be quelled by further chaos; only clarity suffices to end disorder.

“Hairs shrank to tiny things, like wheels spinning in frenzy.” “Fire-eyes and golden pupils could not be opened.” “Pig could not dare lift his eyes or raise his head, unaware of victory or defeat, life or death, lost in doubt and hesitation”—all depict the state of wild delusion without anchor, the moment when wondrous illumination is lost. From lack of illumination arises wild delusion; from wild delusion, the mind loses its illumination. To cure wild delusion, one must first restore illumination. Thus the Traveler said, “Saving Master can wait. I don’t know if there’s an eye-doctor around—let him treat my eyes first.”

“The two paused to look and saw a farmstead, its lamplight flickering dimly.” Already, within obscurity, a sliver of light had been borrowed. “The brothers sought lodging, paid respects to the old farmer, and sat with him. The Traveler asked, ‘Does anyone here sell eye medicine?’” “The elder said, ‘That’s called the *Samādhi Divine Wind*—if it blows on you, you might still live!’” Then he added, “I once met an extraordinary man who transmitted a formula called *Three Flowers, Nine Seeds Ointment*.” This is the wondrous method of *Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown* and *Ninefold Cyclic Elixir*.

Pig laughed, “Sir, where’s your bright staff?” The Traveler replied, “You’re treating me like a blind man.” “Pig chuckled silently, the Traveler snickered softly”—both were veiled mockery, implying that those who blindly cultivate in ignorance have never encountered a true eye-doctor. Zhuangzi said, “Healing the eyes can forestall aging.” So it is.

In the eye-medicine passage, “the guardian” is none other than *shishen*. The entire farmstead was arranged for the eye-medicine application, a provision to retain the Great Sage—indeed, the universal eye-medicine for all beings. Is the “farmstead” (*zhuang*) here any different from Zhuangzi’s “farmstead”?

“The Traveler suddenly awoke; Pig guessed idly”—do not dismiss these as mere jest. They reveal the folly of those without steadfast vision and the ignorance of vulgar eyes. The verse says, “Wondrous medicine cures eye pain; vanquish demons without hesitation.” Clear and decisive, this is the moment when illumination may be attained. Thus, in the following passage, the name of Lingji Bodhisattva appears, and the Golden Star points the way.

Pig said, “You secretly protected Master but could not manifest openly, so you transformed this immortal farmstead.” This shows that the eye-medicine was secretly transmitted by the old farmer—a profound truth not to be openly displayed. The Traveler said, “Let me go to the cave and scout around.” Pig replied, “Find out whether he’s dead or alive. If he’s dead… if he’s not dead…”—all indecisive, wavering words, lacking illumination.

“The Traveler reached the cave entrance, but it was still barred, the demons asleep.” “He transformed into a mosquito and entered; the lesser demons snored on.” All was murky confusion, a realm of dreamlike unawareness. The old demon said, “Guard the door carefully. I fear that gust of wind didn’t kill Sun Wukong.” Such was his fearful hesitation. Then, seeing “a tightly sealed inner door, he slipped inside”—already entering its *samādhi*.

He saw “Master Tang bound to the Wind-Stilling Stake”—a state of constraint and bondage, from which there was no self-liberation. The Master “could only fix his heart on Wukong and Wuneng,” showing how the mind cannot govern itself but seeks external aid. Reciting the *Heart Sutra* alone—what use was that? A lesser demon reported, “I saw a big-eared one, but not the one from yesterday.” Such was the smallness of his perception.

The old demon said, “Sun Wukong is nowhere to be seen—he must have been blown to death by the wind, or else fled to seek reinforcements elsewhere.” Such was the delusion of his perception. The lesser demons replied, “If he’s been blown to death, it would be our good fortune. But what if he wasn’t killed—what then?” Such was the timidity of their words. All was wild conjecture and idle talk, hesitant and wavering, torn between two fears.

Suddenly, the old demon confessed, “Only the Bodhisattva Lingji could still my wind’s power.” This was the hollow admission of a guilty mind, the *shen* revealing itself unbidden—a confession made without torture. As for the Star of Metal, that luminous and merciful constellation, “pointing south with his hand,” “transforming into a gentle breeze and vanishing,” with “Pig Eight Precepts bowing in gratitude”—such was the guidance of a benevolent master, akin to father and mother, for whom one vows to attain the Dao and repay the great debt.

Wukong ascended Mount Sumeru and peered within, seeing only “a hall adorned in brocade splendor, a chamber of solemn dignity. Golden flames and jade mist, wisdom’s sword and virtue’s assembly”—all describing Lingji’s boundless *dharma*-power, a marvel beyond words. The Wind-Stilling Pellet was perfectly round and true, the Flying Dragon Staff swift and wondrous in its divine efficacy. “Revealing his true form, he was but a yellow weasel—having stolen oil from a lamp, dimming its flame, he fled here and became a spirit.” This was the unvarnished truth of his blindness laid bare.

“Seized and brought to Vulture Peak to see the Tathāgata”—precisely the exercise of great *dharma*-power, shattering the web of doubt, attaining the radiant form, and once more beholding the Tathāgata. “The two of them slaughtered a den of cunning hares, fox-spirits, musk deer, and horned stags”—what cunning, what suspicion, what deer-like panic, what branching confusion remained? This was “summoning Lingji to rescue the true monk and rediscover the great western road.”

Alas!

Amidst the lotus thrones and Buddha-realms, blossoms innumerable—knitting his brows, he looked intently.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Pig Battles the Flowing-Sands River; Mokṣa Enforces the Dharma to Subdue Wujing**

Wu Yizi says: “The Perfected One of Purple Yang said:
*Tiger leaps, dragon coils—wind and waves rage rough,
At the central true position, the Mystic Pearl is wrought.
Though fruit on branches ripens in due season’s span,
How could a child in the womb bear any pearl?*
This is the true purport of this chapter.”

The wondrous convergence of the Five Phases lies wholly in the two earths, wù and jǐ. Earth is the center of the Five Phases, presiding over the four seasons, each for eighteen days. Dispersed, it permeates the four times to engender and transform the myriad things; united in its twofold governance, it unifies the Nine Palaces and wondrously gathers the One Origin. Thus metal and water, meeting earth, congeal and gather; wood and fire, meeting earth, harmonize and blend. Wù is yang earth, jǐ is yin earth—metal, water, wood, and fire each possess their wù-jǐ position at the Central Palace, where the Five Phases converge and revert to the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity is but a forced designation. Though earth is one of the Five Phases, it is in truth their culmination. In the human body, it is the true; the true of intent is sincerity. With sincerity, movement and stillness are both true, and nature and feelings attain the mean—hence the noble person must make his intent sincere.

Sha Monk is true earth. The meanings of “flowing sands,” “weak waters,” “skulls,” and “rolled-up curtain” are all revealed in the eighth chapter. This chapter particularly clarifies that metal, water, wood, and fire cannot depart from earth; obtaining this earth, they assume their proper position at the Central Palace, whereupon the functions of the golden elixir are complete and the sagely embryo is formed.

The earlier gāthā of the Bird’s-Nest Chan Master says:
*“The wild boar shoulders his load and goes,”*
*“The ancient stone monkey of many years,”*
*“The water-monster met along the way.”*
“Met” is *gòu*, signifying the wondrousness of their encounter—thus they mutually rely on the great western road. Hence it first says: *“Having crossed Yellow Wind Ridge, one enters a stretch of level ground to the west.”* Yet why should great waters suddenly block the path, so difficult to ford? Not that it is truly hard to cross—precisely in the difficulty of crossing does one encounter and thereby attain passage, which is the great western road.

Yellow is the true color of the center, so from Yellow Wind Ridge the essentials of the Five Phases are drawn forth. In eight lines of verse, the embodiment of all five colors and the fullness of the Nine Palaces are depicted—each word is worthy of contemplation. When Bajie battles the monster, wood meets earth and they mutually overcome. The monster’s own account reveals the wondrousness of the three and five each as a five, within which it says: *“First I gathered the infant boy and the maiden girl, then I took up the wood-mother and metal-father as my staff.”* This is the true import. The two of them fought twice, yet through impatience could not subdue him—why?

When hearts and minds remain unaligned, there is need for patient mediation—this cannot be forced through coercion or haste. Thus when Wukong seeks stillness through impatience, his impatience only grows; when the water monster retreats to provoke action, his movement only makes stillness harder to attain. Hence Bajie’s plea for “ten thousand strategies,” and the Monkey King’s counsel to the master: *“Do not fret,”* followed by *“go beg alms and rest,”* showing that progress in cultivation should be gradual, not rushed. The remark on *“how hard it is to carry clouds”* reveals that ordinary beings can advance step by step but not all at once. The admonition that *“no methods should be applied, only thorough experience in foreign lands”* shows that dull natures value effort over ease. The observation that *“though they could protect, they could not go ahead to fetch the scriptures”* demonstrates that spiritual practice proceeds from difficulty, not ease.

When Bajie enters the water to challenge the monster, the origin of the treasure staff is recounted—phrases like *“length lies in the mind, thickness follows intent”* clearly reveal the operation of true intention and the mind’s radiant wisdom. *“This bout fought underwater then surfaced”* echoes the *Cantong Qi*’s *“where speech fails, they are no kin.”* The verse has already made this plain. For yin and yang to unite, true earth must mediate—just as a matchmaker is needed for a marriage. Where speech fails, hearts remain estranged, and harmony eludes. The line *“only because the wood-mother overcomes the elixir knife”* explicitly identifies Wuneng as wood and Wujing as earth.

*“The monster only clamors by the riverbank, refusing to come ashore”* depicts a nature still in flux, poised between two possibilities—most elusive to grasp. Once impatience takes hold, the creature vanishes without a trace, leaving no opening for action. Thus when Wukong’s temper flares and he leaps into a somersault, the monster conceals himself completely, nowhere to be seen. Only by turning inward in quiet reflection and summoning Guanyin Bodhisattva can the original face be revealed. Wukong then hastens to the Southern Sea to pay homage. The Bodhisattva says: *“You ape, ever relying on your own strength, unwilling to speak of protecting the Tang monk. Had you mentioned ‘the scripture-seeker,’ he would have submitted at once.”* For the protection of the scripture-seeker is the shared purpose of the three. To speak of *“the scripture-seeker”* is to establish common speech, align hearts, and dissolve suspicion through mutual sincerity.

The Bodhisattva calls Huian to fetch the red gourd, bids Wujing take refuge, and arranges the nine skulls in the pattern of the Nine Palaces, placing the gourd at the center—forming a dharma-boat. Excellent indeed! The Great Being’s compassionate vessel ferries the world, revealing the system of the golden elixir.

One who can harness and steer it finds their drifting nature settled, the tranquil waves passable, and thus avoids sinking to instead reach the far shore—all fundamentally rooted in this. The *"gourd"* symbolizes the two earths forming the jade tablet. *"At the center"* they wondrously merge and congeal. The *"arrangement of the Nine Palaces"* is all for my use; here, one establishes life and destiny—what peril or obstruction could remain?

A poem says:
*The Five Agents pair to match celestial truth,
Recognizing the old master from of old.
Refining the self and establishing the foundation—subtle use,
Discerning right and wrong to see the cause.
Metal returns to nature, reuniting with its kind,
Wood departs to seek affinity, yet remains of equal rank.
The two tablets complete the work in stillness,
Harmonizing water and fire without a trace of dust.*

For yin and yang must pair to match celestial truth. The old master was lost, but now may be recognized—this is the subtle use of establishing the foundation, the cause of dispelling the deviant and preserving the upright. Metal departs yet returns, restoring its original nature; self and other were ever of the same kind, metal and wood not of different ranks. Thus, the two tablets complete the work, forming the sacred embryo. From this stillness, nurturing and harmonizing, what trace of water or fire’s dust remains?

This single dharma-boat of the Great Being is like the dragon maiden’s single pearl—it is the original essence of human life. Thus, the Curtain-Lifting General is the true earth of true yin and true yang, the Yellow Dame of marital union, the essential subtlety of forming the embryo and establishing the foundation.

Mujaku then calls forth Wujing, who sincerely submits. The skulls are removed, the Nine Palaces arranged, the gourd placed at the center, and the master invited to sit upon it. Lightly and steadily they cross, waves calm and winds still; in no time, they reach the far shore. Truly, this is the great function of establishing life and destiny, of planting the feet firmly on solid ground.

Yet why is it also called *"pure and non-action"*? For though there is action, it does not adhere—like the Bodhisattva sending Mujaku to demonstrate the dharma without going herself. The operation lies with Wukong and Wuneng, the boat is formed by Wujing, while the Tang monk enjoys non-action. Though there is action, it is in truth non-action.

When Mujaku retrieves the gourd, it transforms into yin qi, the two earths become true, and the Nine Palaces merge completely. From this, the foundation is set, the golden elixir takes form, and the Way of non-action gradually manifests.

Ah! The method of the golden elixir’s function is clearly revealed here!

In Chapter Twenty-Three: "The Tang Monk Remembers His Origin; The Four Sages Test Meditative Resolve"

Wu Yizi says:
The Five Phases converge and cluster, forming the sacred embryo.
The original root is already attained, and life and destiny have their foundation.
From this point, one preserves and nurtures it, gradually shedding the embryo to approach spiritual transformation—thus may celestial immortality be realized.

Yet I fear that worldly people may misconstrue the wondrous Dao of convergence and clustering as the heterodox teaching of "absorbing yin to supplement yang," becoming infatuated at the sight of beauty, sinking into the sea of desire, forgetting their origin and drowning in mere words—how truly pitiable! Therefore, this passage urgently highlights how easily one may be deluded by feminine allure, and how crucial it is to maintain steadfast vigilance, never forgetting one’s original face.

Thus it is said: "This chapter of the tale reveals that the Way of seeking the scriptures does not depart from the Way of attending to the root within one’s own body." Ah! The immortal master’s words are most subtle—"attending to the root" runs through the entire work. Should one glance superficially, the profound principle would be buried and lost.

This "root" does not refer to what lies near or within, but rather to that which, in the opening chapter, precedes heaven and earth as the primordial spiritual root, and which, after the Five Villas’ episode, permeates the later heaven and earth, yet remains the primordial spiritual root. Every person possesses it in full, lacking nothing. Those who have lost it must attend to it to return; returning is but the restoration of what was originally present within. Those who have not lost it must attend to it to avoid forgetting; forgetting means forgetting what was never originally present within. Those who have lost and then regained it must attend to it to preserve it; preservation means securing what was originally present within, letting go of what was not, and fortunately returning to what was.

Hence it is said: "The Way of seeking the scriptures does not depart from the Way within one’s own body." In the verse, "the wayward monkey firmly bound" and "the inferior horse diligently reined" are acts of discipline upon the ground of inherent nature; "Wood Mother and Metal Duke" and "Yellow Dame with Crimson Child" are functions upon the root of life. Once the true message is recognized, this is the great wisdom. With a heavy burden and a long road ahead, all depends on diligent effort.

Should the slightest thought of slackness arise, it is a sign of failing to bear the burden fully—idleness and desire will then gradually sprout. If there is any impulse toward hasty progress, it is a sign of reckless haste and overstepping, inevitably leading to unruliness that cannot be reined in. Pigsy, resenting the weight of his load and urging the horse to speed, thus sows the seeds of trouble. This is like the Monkey King wielding his staff to tame the wayward ape, or spurring the inferior horse to gallop—both acts of discipline.

The episode "Testing the Chan Mind" is overt in its meaning, yet its subtlety lies beyond the words. For while testing the mind is the manifest intent, the alchemical method is still concealed within. Why? To test the mind is merely to test it—one or two beauties would suffice to captivate the soul; why wait for four? Yet the Dao is called the interplay of one yin and one yang. The master and his three disciples naturally form a fourfold harmony, the true number of yin and yang in balance, where none can be lacking. Only when one sees beauty as no beauty and faces temptation without attachment does one attain the unyielding, indestructible body. Scholars may find it easy to sever ties with the world and renounce all things, but when the body itself is subjected to restraint and confronted with temptation, the mind often shifts and resolve is lost.

To achieve true mastery, one must pass through the crucible of tribulation; to recognize pure gold in its full luster, it must be forged in searing flames. The trial by the Four Saints is like testing gold with a touchstone: when gold meets the touchstone, its true grade is revealed; when one encounters the trial of the Four Saints, the sacred and the profane are fully exposed. Nothing in the world stirs the heart more easily than beauty; if one remains unmoved by it, nothing can move the heart at all. This is why the transformed maiden tests them—like refining with fire, only true gold remains unaltered.

In the alchemical method, the female seeks the male, as in a marriage where the groom is brought into the bride’s home. This is no ordinary union, so the Four Saints take the form of women awaiting childbirth to summon a husband, with Pigsy as the groom and Friar Sand as the matchmaker. Yet the Four Saints are nothing other than the true qi of the One. From the One they become four, and from these four arise countless transformations—just as the Great Sage’s true gold can manifest boundless change. Only the Great Sage perceives this and recognizes the subtle work of enlightenment. The hidden meaning of the text is thus made clear.

The woman said, “I was born in the year *dinghai*, on the third day of the third month, at the *you* hour. Thus my husband is three years older than I.” “Three years older” means he belongs to the *shen* year. *Shen* is the Monkey—nothing other than the true *qi* of the One. This estate was left by one born in the Year of the Monkey, so are his wife and daughter not transformations of those not born in the Year of the Monkey? The mother and three daughters together total ninety-nine years in age, the extreme of yang numbers—this is the principle of old yang transforming into yin and producing the daughters.

The *Baihutong* states: “Fire is so called because it transforms.” Thus we know metal can transform into fire, and fire in turn can transform into metal. Here, the four women become the raging fire of four crucibles, and whatever encounters them is inevitably melted and refined. At first, one relies on this fire to congeal the elixir, and in the end, one relies on it to refine the elixir. This transformation is the most essential fire-work in the alchemy of the golden elixir, sufficient to forge and temper one into truth.

How do we know this is fire? The woman said, “I was born in the year *dinghai*.” Is not *ding* fire? Is not *hai* the wood that generates fire? And are they not in a pine and cypress grove, where the art thrives and fire blazes? If so, then her boasts of vast fields, livestock, silks, and embroideries are all the radiance of fire; her praises of Zhenzhen, Aiai, and Lianlian’s beauty are all the spirit of fire; her descriptions of the enjoyments of spring, summer, autumn, and winter are all the movement of fire. Her “sudden rage, turning to enter the screen, and bolting the waist-door” is the rising and falling of fire. Her disregard for Pigsy’s ugliness and eagerness to take him as a son-in-law, so long as he can manage the household, is fire’s indiscriminate melting of jade and stone alike.

Her “suddenly opening the door with a shout, raising a red lantern and a censer, fragrant clouds swirling, the clatter of jade pendants, leading the women in worship” is the fierce, swirling, searing, and refining power of fire. Her “leaving behind a pair of gauze lanterns, leading the fool step by step, the hall aglow with silver candles” is fire’s flickering brilliance, its thoroughness and precision, leaving no place to hide. Her words to the three daughters, giving them handkerchiefs to cover their heads and failing to find a match, are the unpredictable, lively, and elusive nature of fire. Her returning to the room, handing over a pearl-embroidered robe, and binding the fool are fire’s twisting restraint, its intricate and inescapable grasp.

“Those people vanished in an instant, leaving behind a grand hall with carved beams and painted rafters” is fire’s transformative concealment, its marvelous and swift changes, which cannot be grasped by form. When Pigsy “twisted left and right, unable to endure, repeatedly saying ‘let’s discuss this later’; letting go of the reins, calling his mother to arrange the marriage, boasting of his skills, declaring ‘no need to negotiate,’ his lust in disarray, insisting on bowing to them all, ‘all must cover their heads for me,’ and when he failed to catch them, you beckoned me; when he put on the pearl robe and fell to the ground”—all this is the state of being refined by fire, flying and leaping uncontrollably, bound and restrained, losing one’s original nature.

The most crucial point in this passage is Pigsy’s words, “In my youth, I once learned the method of *aozhan*.” Those who recklessly practice *caizhan* take female beauty as their crucible, believing the perverse doctrine of “absorbing yin to supplement yang,” thereby burning themselves to death—like moths flying into flame. How lamentable! Thus the poem concludes with its true meaning: *“The foolish do not know the root cause, / The sword of desire wounds the body in secret.”* This is the harm of seeking scriptures outside the body while neglecting the root.

The verse within states: *“From this, wash the heart and reform the faults.”* This is the essential point: after congealing the elixir, one must thoroughly wash the heart and guard against desire. Without guarding against desire, the original root, once obtained, will be lost again—how pitiful! If one can henceforth not forget the original root, only then is one truly virtuous. Thus it is also said: *“From the correct path, cultivate with care, / Sweep away love and desire to return to truth.”*

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Immortal of Longevity Hill Keeps an Old Friend / The Handsome Monkey King Steals the Ginseng Fruit at Wuzhuang Temple**

*Wu Yizi* says: These five or six chapters together elucidate that consuming the golden elixir is the original root of the body. Within the chapter, the “ginseng fruit of Wuzhuang Temple” expounds the principle of the golden elixir. The “Pure Wind and Bright Moon” striking the fruit and the “elixir plate” receiving it reveal the name of the golden elixir. Its meaning is drawn from the *Doctrine of the Mean*: “Establishing the great root of the world, one can assist heaven and earth in their positions and nurture the myriad things,” transforming the intent of “stiff flesh” into a wondrous awakening, deeply sufficient to break through deafness and enlighten the vulgar. If readers remain ignorant and dismiss it as absurd and unorthodox, they are like the mice in the pine and cypress, unaware of the fine cedar within the hall.

*Can* means “three.” The *Book of Changes* says: “Three for heaven, two for earth, and thus the numbers are established.” One, three, and five are the numbers of heaven; two and four are the numbers of earth. Three threes make nine, the number of old yang; three twos make six, the number of old yin. Two threes and one two make eight, the number of young yin; two twos and one three make seven, the number of young yang. All are “three for heaven, two for earth.” Three multiplied by two is five, which ultimately returns to one. One paired becomes three; three and five transform into three. Three threes are three; five fives are five. Extending this to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million, and even to the infinite, there is nothing that is not “three and two,” nothing that is not one.

Thus the Dao of Heaven is without beginning or end, and through the reckoning of numbers one may infer its mechanism. The Dao of Heaven is most wondrous, and by means of numbers one may illuminate the true principle. Principle is made manifest through numbers, and numbers emerge from principle; they may rely upon each other but may not be violated—hence it is called “relying on numbers.”

What is the One? It is the primordial *qi* of True Unity. Master Zhu said: “Heaven, through yin and yang and the Five Phases, transforms and gives birth to the myriad things. *Qi* forms their shapes, and principle is also bestowed upon them. This principle does not depart from *qi*, nor does *qi* depart from principle.”

The Way of the Golden Elixir takes the cultivation of *qi* as its foundation. The essence of cultivating *qi* lies in accumulating righteousness. If one cannot accumulate righteousness but instead feels shame when looking up and remorse when looking down, then principle is lost and *qi* is obstructed—how can it then fill Heaven and Earth with its vastness? Thus the Way of the Immortals, when it reaches Mencius’ teaching on “cultivating *qi*,” is nearly fully revealed. And when it is said that this *qi* is born of “accumulating righteousness,” the methods of the Elixir are almost complete. Those who cling to emptiness and stillness without understanding the accumulation of righteousness and cultivation of *qi*—the work of the heart—will ultimately perish.

Human life is like a fleeting glimpse of a horse or a dream of a butterfly; Heaven’s mandate is without constancy. One must swiftly turn the light inward, sever desires, and follow principle, embracing impartial vastness. When principle is attained, one’s nature is restored; when nature is restored, life is consolidated. With the vastness of the eye attained, this is called accumulating righteousness and cultivating *qi*; this is called establishing oneself and securing one’s destiny. Its most crucial point lies in vigilance in solitude.

In a single thought of numinous clarity, preserve the genuine and eliminate the false, never departing from it for even a moment. What Heaven has bestowed upon me is only this; and what I use to practice virtue and attain the Dao is only this. Relying solely on this as the master, one is not swayed by emotions nor bound by names and conventions. Gain and loss, constant change—none of these are heeded. This is what it means to be steadfast.

Vigilance renders the heart’s ground empty and vast—this is the state before arousal, the establishment of the great root of the world, the original face of human life. Unfallen into being or non-being, unconfined by place, without sound or scent, it is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate. Confucius’ joy was in this; Yan Hui’s unchanging joy was in this. Li Yanping’s silent sitting and embodied realization were realizations of this; Lu Xiangshan’s “first establishing the great” was first establishing this. Chen Baisha’s emergence of signs in stillness—this was the very sign.

Those who have not yet recognized this must still it to perceive it; those who have recognized it must still it to nurture it. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, one must move to embody this; when engaging with affairs and encountering things, one must face circumstances to verify this. This is what is meant by observing the mechanism of movement and stillness, being and non-being, and preserving the all-encompassing, unfathomable spirit.

Once the great root is established, the thousand branches and ten thousand leaves all flourish and grow unimpeded. Thus one can establish the heart for Heaven and Earth, secure the destiny of the people, and assist Heaven and Earth in nurturing the myriad things.

Yet even when one has fully attained this spirit—luminous and numinous, capable of responding to myriad changes, foreseeing past and future, equalizing life and death, transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—one may consider it the ultimate and complete, true and without further addition. But how is this spirit merely the yin spirit of the postnatal, not the yang spirit of the prenatal? When the Four Great Elements disperse, it remains solitary and is still bound by the regulations of Heaven and Earth, unable to regulate them. Heaven and Earth must settle this spirit in the place of utmost yang before it can fully attain its original root. The original root lies where I was born, inseparable from the primordial *qi* of True Unity.

Though principle is not mixed with *qi*, it is never apart from *qi*. Thus where *qi* transforms, there too is the abode of spirit and principle. *Qi* has no luminous, numinous spirit, but possesses a spirit of profound obscurity. The spirit that is not spirit is the ultimate spirit; the spirit of the ultimate spirit is the ultimate truth. When people speak of this spirit, they are utterly at a loss. Even those who claim to recognize it do not know where to begin, and some dismiss it entirely with the phrase “seeking the obscure and practicing the strange!”

Consider this: the *River Chart*, the *Luo Writing*, and the *Great Change* are the ancestral methods of the ancient divine sages, transmitted in the hearts of the Zhou and Confucius to enlighten later generations. What they expound—yin and yang in their proper and reversed sequences, the principles of the prenatal and postnatal—are these truly “seeking the obscure and practicing the strange”?

I do not say that fully attaining this luminous, numinous, and unwavering spirit is not the true Way, but rather that only when one reaches the utmost can one fully attain the luminous, numinous, and unwavering as the ultimate truth. Thus it is said: “If you wish for the Valley Spirit never to die, you must establish the root in the Mysterious Female.”

Let me clarify the meaning of this passage: At the beginning of the chapter, the Eight Precepts were bound by selfish desires, having lost their original root. The Traveler’s words in the *Xun* trigram faintly illuminated a hundred aspects, reminding and arousing their sense of shame and innate goodness. The *West River Moon* verse states: “There is only one original root, with no trifling profit to add to the bag. Safeguard this capital well, firmly guard it and do not let it dissipate.” This speaks of preserving what has not been lost, returning what has been lost, and, having lost and then returned, being vigilant—there is only one, with no possibility of addition.

From this, one knows that the depravity of those who practice sexual arts is like the Eight Precepts fainting in confusion, senseless. The Eight Precepts, ashamed, said: “From now on, I will never dare to act recklessly.” This is the moment of a scholar’s repentance and entry into the Way. Thus the author, in concluding the harm of lust, subtly reveals the root—this is the One.

The number One is contained within Five and reaches its utmost in the myriad. The outline speaks of “Mount Everlife,” and the inexhaustible myriad myriad is already encompassed within the myriad; it speaks of the “Abbey of Five Estates,” and the boundless permutations of five are already unified within Five.

The Five comprise three of Heaven and two of Earth, yet none depart from metal, wood, water, fire, and soil. Paired with the Five Teachings, they become benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; united in the One Origin, they form the Primal Chaos and the Supreme Ultimate. The text explicitly states: “When the Primal Chaos first divided and the Vast Mist began to separate, at the moment before Heaven and Earth unfolded, this Spiritual Root was produced.” This Spiritual Root is the same as the Spiritual Root in the opening chapter, yet it distinguishes between the prior-to-Heaven and the posterior-to-Heaven: the former, existing before Heaven and Earth, is the Spiritual Root that gives rise to Heaven and Earth—what is meant by “There is something prior to Heaven and Earth,” which is the prior-to-Heaven that Heaven does not transgress; the latter, arising after Heaven and Earth, is the Spiritual Root produced by Heaven and Earth—what is meant by “Within it lies a treasure, hidden in the mountain of form,” which is the posterior-to-Heaven that Heaven does not transgress. It emerges from the prior-to-Heaven and enters the posterior-to-Heaven. The Spiritual Roots of prior and posterior to Heaven are ultimately one qi, ultimately the Great Root, ultimately the progenitor of the Five Phases. Those who study the Dao, if they can obtain this prior-to-Heaven qi within the posterior-to-Heaven, can thereby master this qi to govern the myriad principles of the posterior-to-Heaven, without falling into isolation.

The outline speaks of the “Great Immortal”—between Heaven and Earth, only this Root is great; of the “Pilgrim”—between Heaven and Earth, only this is the movement of the Five Phases; of “retaining old friends”—retaining the old refers to traces already manifest; of “stealing the ginseng”—stealing the ginseng praises the power of Heaven and Earth. The text’s declaration to “offer incense and worship solely to the words ‘Heaven and Earth’” makes the fundamental intent clear. The boy says, “These two words—the one below cannot receive our incense,” meaning it belongs to yin and is insufficient to match the marvel of Heaven. The elder, having beheld the fine scenery of Mount Everlife, finds its secluded charm extraordinary and believes the Thunderclap Monastery is not far, but the Pilgrim laughs: “Too soon! Too soon!”

Here the Tang Priest has reached this stage—though he recognizes the original Root, he cannot examine it with true insight. To advance further, the original Root remains the original Root, yet still eludes his grasp. Only through reverent seeking, wholehearted devotion, and unwavering aspiration can it be fully preserved without loss. As the saying goes, “Recognizing the original Root is but the beginning of true work”—mere empty awakening does not bring one to Vulture Peak. Thus the Pilgrim speaks of such difficulty, urging him to sudden awakening: “If only your mind is sincere in seeing your nature, every moment of turning back is Vulture Peak itself.” This echoes the *Zhou Odes*: “Learning ever shines brighter toward radiance,” warning against needless doubts of distance or separation, lest the original Root be grasped and then lost again.

Only the Five-Zhuang Temple of Western Ox-Head Continent yields this “Herb of Returned Elixir,” also called “Ginseng Fruit.” The West is the direction of Lesser Yin, corresponding to autumn, the season when the myriad things bear fruit. Fruit embodies yang within yin—postnatal qi harboring the prenatal One. That ginseng grows between Heaven and Earth to become fruit follows the same principle. The character *草* (herb) is composed of *甘* (sweet), *日* (sun), and *十* (ten): two figures paired, encompassing the numbers of Heaven (one), Earth (ten), and the four directions with the center. Within lies the utmost yang, combining to form its image—hence *草* (herb), which also means “early,” urging swift return of the elixir. This is the true gold of the Golden Elixir, the rightful heir of returning to the origin—thus the name “Zhen Yuanzi” (Master of the Origin). If one can consume it, partaking of Heaven and Earth to become all things, how is this not to reign as lord of the world?

“It bears fruit once every three thousand years; to smell one grants three hundred and sixty years of life; to eat one, forty-seven thousand.” Among his scattered immortals, countless in number, forty-eight remain in sight. He takes forty-six to Heaven, leaving two to guard the temple: one aged one thousand three hundred and twenty, the other one thousand two hundred. Though the numbers of Three Heavens and Two Earths are interwoven to depict its marvel, this is no empty talk but solid truth—all ultimately deriving from the One and Five, extending to the myriad things.

Master Zhen Yuan instructs Pure Wind and Bright Moon to pluck ginseng fruit in welcome of old friends. The two lads, citing Confucius’ words, doubt they share the same path, revealing their deep understanding of how worldly scholars cling to Confucianism and doubt the Dao. The Great Immortal, recalling the Buddha’s assembly, clarifies their bond as old friends, pointing to the shared origin of Dao and Confucianism. When master and disciples arrive at the temple, they admire the scenery, read the couplets within, and inquire of Pure Wind and Bright Moon—yet these are not the “Heaven and Earth” incense offerings, for they speak of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy inviting one to taste the Dao Fruit of Chaos. All describe the reality of Two Earths and Three Heavens, the profound mystery of the prenatal True One, though people fail to recognize it.

The Pilgrim’s mischief is no mere temper—it exposes how worldly folk all claim sagely wisdom and heroic might. Even one as spiritually awakened as the Pilgrim struggles to yield and believe; how rare, then, are true kindred spirits! The Tang Priest, unaware of this rare treasure, trembles and retreats three feet—not from ignorance, but to show how worldly eyes, even in one with deep karmic roots like the Tang Priest, find it hard to receive such guidance. How many, then, abandon themselves to fate!

Pig, drooling with greed, schemes to taste the new; the Pilgrim turns invisible, climbs the tree, and steals the fruit. When one falls and vanishes, they summon the local earth god to investigate. This reveals how all covet the Golden Elixir, yet without true knowledge, none dare consume it hastily. The Pilgrim calls himself “the most notorious thief under Heaven”—no idle boast, for this path steals from Heaven and Earth, seizing the workings of creation, truly the ringleader of the treasury of principle.

The earth god says: “This fruit fears the Five Phases: it withers at wood, dissolves in water, burns in fire, and sinks into earth. Only when struck by metal does it fall; only when wrapped in silk can it be held.” For the Golden Elixir is the primordial qi of chaos, not leaning toward any single phase. To favor one is to fail in bearing true fruit—no margin for error, as the saying goes: “A hair’s breadth of deviation and the elixir will not form.”

The Great Sage steals three; the three share them, united in purpose. Pig, insatiable in greed, clamors and ruins the plan, unable to guard against danger. The two lads revile the Tang Priest, who says: “Virtue and righteousness matter most; have them apologize.” Yet the three disciples deny all—proof that the Tang Priest cannot partake of the Golden Elixir, foreshadowing the later uprooting of the tree. The Golden Elixir harmonizes the Five Phases and embodies the Five Virtues: the Tang Priest’s hesitation is lack of wisdom; the disciples’ denial, lack of faith. Without wisdom and faith, two of the Five Virtues are missing, three of the Five Phases unbalanced. With the root shaken, the fruit vanishes—is this not the inevitable workings of principle and fate?

Note: To the west of Persia lies a kingdom called Dashi. Its king often sends men by ship with provisions into the sea. After eight years, they still have not reached the western shore. In the sea, they see a square stone, upon which grows a tree with red branches and green leaves. On the tree, countless infants, six or seven inches long, neither speak nor cry but all can smile, moving their hands and feet, their heads fixed to the branches. When plucked, they wither and blacken in hand. The envoy brings back one branch, now kept by the king of Dashi. From this, we see such trees truly exist in the world—far from absurd. The immortal master merely borrows this to expound the Dao of the Golden Elixir, partaking of the creative workings of Heaven and Earth.

Those of limited knowledge like Jia Dao and Meng Jiao, unaware even of the infant tree, how could they ever grasp the wonders of the Golden Elixir!

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Immortal Zhenyuan Gives Chase to Seize the Pilgrim Monks; Sun Wukong Raises Havoc at Wuzhuang Temple**

Wu Yizi observes: The earlier verse states, *"There is but one original root—no trifling profit to swell the purse."* Yet Zhu Bajie, in his greed, seeks to add where nothing is to be gained; Tang Sanzang, in his ignorance, resists and obstructs. Whether excessive or deficient, both fail to savor the true flavor—for the flavor lies in the original.

The root is first uprooted; whence then does the Dao arise? If one does not thoroughly investigate and firmly cultivate this fundamental root, it is to abandon the source for the branches, to remain ignorant of the hidden mechanism within one’s sleeve. One may attempt to steal across Chen Cang in darkness, yet know not that one’s footing is weak. No matter how cunning the schemes, no matter how extreme the transformations, all remain but illusory passions and false appearances—shifting and erring, turning back and forth, with no means of deliverance. Would this not delay the journey, preventing one from ever reaching the Western Heaven and beholding the Buddha’s face? As the saying goes: *"The halo behind the neck is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet do not make one an immortal."*

This is like the Great Sage toppling the tree’s fruit, whereupon the two youths bolt the layered gates, declaring: *"You’ve ruined the immortal root of our Wuzhuang Temple! If you wish to reach the Western Heaven and pay homage to the Buddha, you’ll have to turn back, re-enter the wheel of rebirth, and be born again!"* Stern in word and just in principle, their admonition is as thunderous as a hibernating dragon’s roar, as nurturing as a compassionate sail in the rain.

Yet Wukong laughs, revealing the truth; the two youths curse, branding him a thief; Bajie clamors to strike, taking sides—all mistaking the false for the true. How could they not forsake the real for the illusory? By uprooting the divine tree and severing the elixir’s lineage, their cry of *"Let’s all scatter!"* is as apt as *"When the tree falls, the monkeys disperse"*—precise and unerring. The verse *"Wukong has ruined the Herb of Returning Life; the bright moon and clear wind chill the heart and gall"* serves as the sharpest awakening.

For one must first act, then gradually attain effortless mastery. If one merely awakens to the emptiness within *"emptiness"* but fails to recognize the *"fruit of emptiness"* within that emptiness, what result can a single awakening yield? Is this not to lose the Returning Elixir in the very act of awakening? Though the clear wind and bright moon remain, how can they be enjoyed? In the end, one will still fall into the dust, unable to accomplish anything.

Locking the gates and lying are but mixed tactics—where then is the method to revive the dead? Adding greens and serving tea are but misapplied, rigid views; shutting the doors and hurling abuse only create a scene of verbal strife. Unlocking the gates to flee by night is but groping in the dark—though one may temporarily escape the cage, one cannot evade the net. Rushing forth while others sleep is but stumbling and falling—though one may strive forward, one will ultimately lag behind.

Thus, Immortal Zhenyuan awakens the two drowsy youths to investigate the root of the harm, and pursues them for nine hundred *li* to seize back the reckless ones who have obscured their origin. His mastery of the universe within his sleeve is like the strings that manipulate puppets—what is meant by *"The Heavenly Gate in hand, the Earth’s Axis born in the heart."*

*"Each tied to a single pillar"* shows that every person is inseparable from their fundamental root—how can one stand without relying on it? The hasty use of the Seven-Star Whip made from dragon skin to strike them reveals that each must be interrogated to uncover their origin—how can one not reflect deeply and gain insight! *"Striking the legs"* strikes at their unsteady footing—how can they wander recklessly? *"Substituting the blows"* substitutes repeated inquiry so that they may hasten forward.

If one relies on cleverness and deploys petty wit, seeking to use the fragile willow’s form for the plan of rebirth and transformation, this is to take the false as real—even the real becomes false. Like stealing away at midnight, it is nothing but a dream. When master and disciples transform the willow tree into an illusory body while obscuring the truth that the human and tree are the real body, how can the elder not nod off in the saddle, his foundation unsteady?

Once reproached, their guilt collapses; the Great Immortal catches up and seizes them again, binding them as before. He wraps the three in cloth, then lacquers them—those who obscure their origin do so because they cannot turn inward to illuminate themselves. The many-eyed cloth is wrapped tightly around them so that their entire bodies may grow eyes to seek clarity; the outer lacquering ensures that, though the exterior is dark, the interior may shine with self-awareness. If one cannot turn inward to awaken to the root, one is not far from death—even if revived from such a tight encasement and lacquered for burial, it is still a stroke of fortune. Who would say it is inappropriate?

Why is Wukong alone ordered into the oil cauldron? Oil is water; the cauldron is metal. Beneath it burns wood and fire; within it lies stone and earth. Though the five phases gather in their forms, they remain easily stained by grease and fat. Moreover, they are divided and disharmonious, unable to unite as one. If scholars do not fathom the deep source within but merely follow the external traces, their desiccation will come swiftly.

Toppling the immortal root serves to chastise the confusion of truth and falsehood; mistaking the false for the true serves to test one’s exhaustion. Uprooting the tree and overturning the hearth follow the same principle—both are but a great uproar. When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter; when the cauldron leaks, the oil dries—how can one not regret the tumult?

Alas! The difficulty of descending into the oil cauldron is like the difficulty of ascending to the Western Heaven! Only by enduring the oil cauldron can one ascend to the Western Heaven. Wukong may be able to descend but cannot; he may be able to ascend but cannot. If he cannot protect Tang Sanzang, neither descending nor ascending, neither ascending nor descending—what is to be done? To protect Tang Sanzang, descend into the cauldron, and ascend to Heaven, one must still turn inward, reflect, and invite Guanyin Bodhisattva.

Chapter Twenty-Six: Sun Wukong Seeks the Formula on Three Isles; Guanyin Bodhisattva Revives the Tree with Sweet Springs

Wu Yizi states: This precisely speaks of ingesting the golden elixir as the fundamental principle of cultivating the body.

Formerly, the Fifth Patriarch, Great Master Hongren, transmitted a verse to the Sixth Patriarch, Huineng:

*"When the sentient come to sow the seed,
By the ground the fruit will grow.
The insentient, lacking seed,
Lack nature and thus no birth."*

Having received it, Huineng added: *"The robe covers only your body—do not transmit it further."* When Huiming pursued him to inquire about the Dharma, the Sixth Patriarch said: *"Do not think of good, do not think of evil. At just this moment, return to me Venerable Ming’s original face."* Ming greatly awakened and asked: *"Beyond these secret words, is there yet meaning?"* The Sixth Patriarch replied: *"What I now tell you is not secret; if you turn inward in reflection, the secret remains with you."* The Sixth Patriarch then instructed him to go north to receive others.

Later, the Sixth Patriarch arrived at Caoxi, where he was pursued by wicked youths. Concealing his traces among the Huai and Ji districts, he at last accomplished the great matter.

How can fruit arise without seed? How can nature take form without sentiment? That nature cannot exist apart from sentiment is like fruit that cannot grow apart from the earth. When the Sixth Patriarch spoke of not thinking of good or evil, he had already returned the original face—yet he still said, *"Not secret; you must turn inward in reflection."* Instructing him to go north to receive others—whom was he to receive? This may be clearly understood.

Otherwise, like passing through the Wuzhuang Temple only to miss the ginseng fruit before one’s very eyes—is this not to be without sentiment and seed, and how then can there be nature and life? The Venerable Xue Daoguang, with his wondrous awakening beyond the dust, keen wisdom, and perfect comprehension, ultimately turned inward in reflection, yet deemed it not the supreme vehicle. Seeking out a true person and receiving guidance, he was drenched in sweat and suddenly repented his past errors. Thereupon, he cast off his monastic robes, returned to lay life, and concealed himself in a bustling metropolis, relying on the powerful to resolve his great matter before attaining the true fruit. This was Daoguang’s turning inward to seek the method, humbling himself to gain benefit.

Thus it may be known that mere awakening is not the true seed, and without sentiment, nature cannot be fulfilled. Mencius said, *"Whether one dies young or lives long, one does not waver; one cultivates the self and awaits destiny—this is how to establish one’s mandate."* Master Jing said, *"Though one stands unmoving at the hundred-foot pole’s tip, to have entered thus is not yet true. Take one more step at the hundred-foot pole’s tip, and the ten directions are your entire body."* The *Awakening to Reality* states, *"Only when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form; the Dao resides in the subtle and imperceptible, harmonizing with nature. Once the golden elixir is swallowed into the belly, one knows at last that my destiny is not ruled by Heaven."* All speak of exhausting one’s nature to reach destiny, obtaining the primordial utmost essence as the supreme vehicle of the Great Dao.

Those who study the Dao in cultivating the self and dwelling in the world must not rely on self-strength; they must empty their minds, humble themselves before others, guard against deceit, and seek instruction—only after diminishing again and again can they gain true benefit.

Sun Wukong, with his divine transformations and extraordinary prowess, protected the Tang Monk, believing himself invincible in his strength—yet how much more invincible was the protection afforded by the ginseng fruit! How could Wukong escape the grasp of Zhenyuan? Why? Because empty awakening is not as real as the fruit.

The eight opening lines precisely diagnose the root malady, and the concluding line—*"For those stubborn in their rigidity, there are always others more rigid still"*—reveals that those mired in self-adherence remain utterly deluded. When the Immortal Zhenyuan took the pilgrim’s hand, it was the mechanism to guide the Tang Monk; when he demanded the tree be restored, it was to urge the cultivation of the Tang Monk’s root. He further said, *"If you can revive the tree, I will bow to you eight times and take you as my sworn brother."* For friendship is the mutual aid of having and lacking, and fraternal love is the support of hand and foot.

The immortals’ path begins with action and culminates in non-action—having is none other than non-being. If one cannot act as having, how can one act as non-having? The Buddha’s path begins with non-action and arises from action—non-being remains being. If one cannot be without non-being, how can one be with being? In silent accord and shared intent, they originally form a single principle, all seeking the same method of reviving the dead.

Though this passage speaks of the Monkey King’s quest across three isles for a remedy, it truly reveals the two schools’ unity in their original source. Could the Great Immortal not heal the tree himself? Yet he specifically invited Guanyin—this is to clarify that non-being precedes being, and to show that transformation has its wellspring. Though master and disciple each possessed their own spiritual root, they deferred to the Immortal Zhenyuan—this is to clarify that the self resides within others, and that their qi is not two.

From this discernment and pursuit, even the Three Stars of the Eastern Sea could not surpass its wonder. Naturally, they converged at Wuzhuang Temple, adding longevity, fortune, and prosperity. Even the Eastern Flower Patriarch could not surpass its divinity, and so extolled Wuzhuang Temple as a blessed land, a cave heaven, a spiritual root. Though the Nine Elders of Yingzhou could not advance further, they marveled at Wuzhuang Temple, hastening to welcome its master, offering him nectar to drink and jade lotus to eat.

Zhu Bajie tugging at the Star of Fortune to beg for fruit, rummaging about in chaos—this reveals his heavenly nature. Wukong laughing at Dongfang Shuo for stealing peaches without success, their mutual jesting—this too shows that it was not truly possessed. All these scenes, reflected through the ginseng fruit, in jest and play, truly convey that the ginseng fruit is not easily obtained.

Only upon reaching the rocky cliffs of Putuo and meeting Guanyin Bodhisattva did they recognize the subtle and imperceptible as the highest grade, the true flavor of Shaolin. Seeing that even the bear spirit had the affinity to attain the true fruit, how could the Tang Monk lack the means to save the spiritual root? Zhenyuan’s spiritual root was opened by Heaven; the sweet dew from the pure vase was wrought by the self.

The poem says:
*"To perfect the body of action, one must long practice the truly wondrous Dao.
This is indeed the true essence of the entire work."*

The *Diamond Sutra* states:
*"If one sees me in form, seeks me in sound, such a one walks the deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata."* For the truly wondrous Dao is profound and difficult to perceive, lying entirely in the heart’s inward reflection and tranquil observation. To cling even slightly to sound or form is to depart from the formless, odorless original substance—such a one walks the deviant path and is cut off from the Tathāgata.

It further says:
*"All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew, like lightning—contemplate them thus."* Some interpreters say that all conditioned things are illusory, understanding only the fleetingness of a galloping horse’s shadow or a butterfly’s dream, the spark struck from stone or the flower in the mirror—what real benefit is there in this? Those skilled in discourse assign a meaning to every word, never repeating themselves—how much more so the World-Honored One! These four lines are the essential pointer of the entire sutra; how can one reduce them to a single "emptiness" and treat "dreams," "illusions," "bubbles," "shadows," "dew," and "lightning" as one and the same?

Thus, only by grasping the meaning of *"like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows"* can one grasp the mechanism of *"like dew, like lightning."*

The common folk fail to grasp the true essence of the *sweet dew* and the *dragged lightning* as the *lingering root’s* genuine virtue. They abandon the *suchness* of conditioned existence to enter the unconditioned, believing that through perception and insight they have attained awakening. Yet I do not know what they perceive, what they see, or what they awaken to. By the twenty-fourth night of the twelfth month, all will dissolve and vanish—deeply lamentable!

The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states:
*"If one follows the inclinations of all beings,
then one honors the Buddhas with supreme reverence.
With the water of great compassion nourishing all beings,
one cultivates the wisdom flowers and fruits of the Bodhisattvas."*

When Guanyin arrives in the rear garden, she dips a willow branch into the *sweet dew* and takes the gentle and weak as the ferry into the Dao. She draws a *resuscitation talisman* on the practitioner’s palm, seizing it as the reins to congeal the *true essence*. Observing the water’s flow as the measure, she forbids violating the *Five Phases’* vessels, relying on *non-dependence* as the standard for action. The *lingering root* transcends the Five Phases and exists alone; the *sweet dew* nourishes the original transformation to benefit all things. The withered roots revive upon receiving it; the fallen fruits restore themselves. "The fruit tree returns to life, gaining an extra one"—is this not the clear proof of returning to the origin, restoring the root, and fulfilling the mandate?

This is indeed *"nourishing with the water of great compassion to cultivate the wisdom flowers and fruits."*

*"The great immortal urgently commands taking gold to strike the child,
knocking down ten, arranging them on the elixir field,
each eating one—thus forming the gathering of the *rénshēng* fruit.*
It speaks of the *golden elixir* belonging to all; the great immortal merely hosts as an expression of fulfilling old debts. From this point, the *golden elixir* is complete—ingested, it revives the dead as one revived, like the dead returning to life. The treasure of the immortals is obtained; the foundation for the Western Heaven is laid. All are immortals of eternal youth—why fear not seeing the *jiao-liu* golden Buddha?"

They become brothers; the two families merge into one. The wondrous Dao of ripening causes and conditions is thus fulfilled.

If scholars rely only on their own rigidity, refusing to yield, ponder, or seek instruction, how can they recognize the extraordinary *rénshēng* fruit of the Five庄 Observatory in the *Mount Wànshòu*?

Thus the patriarch said:
*"I possess a treasure, hidden in the *xíng* mountain."*
Do the others recognize it?

**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: The Corpse Demon Plays Three Tricks on Tang Sanzang**

The Saintly Monk, having consumed the *rénshēng* ginseng fruit, now has the *golden elixir* within him. Henceforth, he has shed his mortal form and transformed his bones—his spirit refreshed, his body robust.

Yet after attaining the elixir, one must still clarify the mind and perceive true nature, discarding the common mortal form and exchanging it for the refined. If he fails to recognize truth, to see through illusions, if he appears merciful yet slips into indulgence, if he seems wise yet is blinded by cunning deceit, then his virtue may become excessive and invite *róngxié* perversity, his wisdom may falter and risk abandoning the right path!

Thus, the Corpse Demon’s three tricks are revealed, and the Saintly Monk’s resentment in driving him away is justified.

The Corpse Demon is none other than the *qì* shell of those who cultivate the Dao. Originally a malevolent spirit that deludes, it can mislead others unaware. It appears as a youthful beauty, yet is truly hollow white bone; it seems like a tender youth, yet is actually frail and aged; it masquerades as a living *bóshā* (菩萨), yet is in truth *jiūpánchútú* (鸠盘荼); it feigns pity, yet is merely a fool toying with others.

For the human body harbors three Corpse Demons, which resent one’s attainment of the Dao, and during moments of slumber, they accuse one of transgressions.

Those who seek the Dao, if they cling to form and appearance without first annihilating the three Corpse Demons, will never escape the mortal shell nor ascend to the *Yùjīng* (玉京) of immortality.

Thus, those who cling to the body are like guardians of the Corpse Demon, and the Demon’s accusations against them are countless. Those who preserve the body must only focus on eliminating the Demon, for its schemes against them are unfathomable.

How great is the Demon’s power to bewitch and mislead!

In this chapter, *"Sanzang was journeying to the Zōngyá place when hunger struck"*—just when the Corpse Demon sought to claim him as its meal. The Pilgrim declared, *"Master, you lack understanding!"*—meaning he failed to see through the deception.

Sanzang, drowning in his own partiality and displeased, took this as a harm wrought by hunger, yet his clouded wisdom was the root of his straying from the right path.

Since Sanzang subdued the Pilgrim at *Liángjiè Shān* (两界山), he has upheld the right and banished the false, combining both wisdom and courage—his deeds truly magnificent.

The monk also knew the Pilgrim could not be separated for an instant, so why did he suddenly grow angry at his lingering laziness, forgetting the favor of saving his life at *Liángjiè Shān*, yet acting as if he had done some great deed?

The author’s meaning is subtle!

*Liángjiè Shān* is the place where right and false stand opposed. Earlier, when the Pilgrim was confined between its towering peaks, it was a test of perceiving true nature and the beginning of his fate. Hence, Sanzang subdued him to establish this foundation.

Now, *"journeying to the Zōngyá place"* signifies the boundary of fate and the preservation of true nature—so Sanzang cast him aside as a warning.

To the Pilgrim, it showed that talent and cleverness are not to be relied upon, nor achievements to be boasted of.
To Sanzang, it revealed that *Mìluó*’s (汨罗) lone loyalty must be discerned, while *Huáiyīn*’s (淮阴) superficial merits are easily misjudged.

The chapter concludes with the Great Sage recounting *"In Chang’an, there was Liu Bǒqīn who saw me off on my journey, and at Liángjiè Shān, he saved my life"*—down to the lines *"When the birds are done, the bow is hidden; when the hare is dead, the dog is cooked"*—each word dripping with sorrow, causing all ages of heroes to weep in grief.

Yet suspicion and mistrust arise from the separation of *yīnrǒu* (阴柔) forces, while banishment often stems from the slanderous tongues of those who speak ill.

Eight Precepts mistook white bones for a fair visage, believing the devourer to be a monk begging alms—thus dragging maggot-tails as fragrant rice and toad-meat as fried gluten. The Three Temptations of the Corpse-Mara were but tricks to blind the eyes. The more one indulged, the more skillful they became, yet in the end, they could never deceive the discerning. The bones remained white.

The Great Sage’s slaughter was the act of one with keen perception. Yet even after repeated victories, his merit led only to slander and suppression, burying his loyal heart.

The world’s fickleness and affairs’ reversals are timeless—no cause for astonishment. Only when a brother envies his elder does strife erupt within the household walls, while a master’s disdain for his disciple sparks sudden rejection between teacher and student. When wood rots, worms infest; when suspicion arises, slander spreads. All stems from failing to turn away from evil or to uphold the good.

The *Qiaoyao Song* states:
*"To grasp fate’s command, to lose ancestral nature—
Like a mirror without gems to hold one’s face.
A life as vast as heaven and earth, yet a fool’s grasp,
Holding wealth like a masterless pawn."*

Thus, one who embodies the innate luminosity without deceit is truly established in the Dao, achieving the utmost of effortless action.

In days past, Bodhidharma sat nine years facing the wall, penetrating truth through meditation, before returning to the West with but a single sandal—mastering the wondrous Dao of cultivating both life and nature. Beginning with the physical form, ending with its shedding.

One does not gaze upon white bones as if they were a fair visage, but as white bones; nor does one gaze upon white bones as white bones, but as a fair visage. Thus, one attains clarity.

There is a method of observing white bones, though it belongs to lesser teachings, yet worthy of note. Imagine the left big toe rotting, oozing foul fluid, gradually spreading to the calf, then the knee, then the waist—so too the right. Gradually, the rot spreads past the waist, to the abdomen, the chest, and finally the neck, until nothing remains but white bones. Observe them clearly, one by one, until, after long contemplation, you ask: *Who is it that observes these bones?* Then you realize the body is always separate from oneself.

Next, observe the bones from a distance—first one *zhang*, then five, ten, a hundred, thousands—until you see that these bones have nothing to do with you. If you dwell on this reflection, you will know that the self and the physical form are two distinct things. The self temporarily resides within the form—why cling to it forever, dwelling within it?

Thus, one may equalize birth and death, achieving a profound insight into shedding the shell and transcending the world.

The *"husband"* in this passage refers to one who shares the same journey and fate as me—not a spouse in the conventional sense. If mistaken as such, it remains one layer removed, not the immediate Corpse-Mara.

At first, the illusion took the form of a beautiful woman, with moon-like features and flower-like grace. Though clearly a demon, the Elder did not recognize it. With sweet words, it offered *"this meal to the monk."* Eight Precepts nearly succumbed—his nature driven by food and desire, yet unable to take its form.

When the Pilgrim returned and saw through the deception, he struck it down at once, crushing the false corpse beneath his palm. In an instant, maggots writhed and toads leapt. Was desire truly his nature? Or was it not?

Then the illusion took the form of an old woman.

The aged one is not like the youthful man—his face wrinkled like a crumpled silk pouch, the very same as the earlier fair young woman.

The Pilgrim recognized it, raised his staff, and struck. The false Corpse-Mara was again cast aside beneath the roadside.

In a blink, the young became aged, the aged became dead, and the dead turned to withered bones. Was the young one truly in peril? And the aged even more so?

Then the illusion transformed into an old man.

The Pilgrim laughed, *"I am the ancestor of the Tooth-and-Nail Tiger—how dare you hide a ghost in your sleeve to deceive me? I know you are a demon!"*

As the Great Sage’s staff rose, he felled the fiend, revealing its true form—a row of characters on its back: *"White Bone Matron."*

In the passing moment, the young aged, the aged died, and the dead became desiccated. The young, the aged, the dead—all reduced to a single White Bone Matron.

「Though it be called *"Three Illusions"*, it is in truth like the *"Three Precepts"*;
Though it be called *"Three Slayings"*, it is in fact the *"Three Births"*.

The Tripitaka Master did not regard it as a kindness, but instead as a grievance;
He did not see it as a merit, but rather as a crime—how deeply deceived he was!

What difference is there between this and the *"Five Relationships"* of one who marries three orphaned wives,
Yet is accused of assaulting his mother-in-law;
Or the case of *Zeng Can* who thrice reported a murder,
Only to see his virtuous mother cast into grief?

*"The wise fail to awaken the ignorant—only adding to their confusion,"*
Taking paper and ink to write a letter of censure,
With rewards and punishments unclear, actions reversed—
How lamentable! How thrice I sigh!

Thus, those who attain the Dao/Way as masters have the clear discernment of slaying the *Three Corpses*,
And controlling the *Three Pests*;
They possess the full ability of *Three Hair-Cutting* and *Three Marrow-Washings*.

If one cherishes only the body’s shell,
Yet fails to recognize it as mere white bone—
Then when the *yin-qi* invades and harasses,
How long before one escapes its grasp?
The *yang-virtue/power*’s observation and judgment
Shall never rise above!

It remains the state of the Monkey King unvanquished in the *Two Realms*,
Though he ingested the *Golden Elixir*,
Yet still fell prey to demonic hindrances—
How could he hope for a happy beginning and a happy end?

This holy monk’s regret in driving away the Monkey King
And thus losing his own splendor—
Truly, he deserves no pity!

As the Pilgrim prepared to depart,
His tears flowed unceasingly, his heart heavy with farewell,
He paid his respects with utmost sincerity,
His loyalty and devotion sincere and true—
His tender concern could not bear to leave,
Deeply moved by the spirit of ancient loyal ministers
Who, exiled from their homeland, still yearned for their lord.

Reading the lines:
*"Tears fell from his cheeks,
He paused mid-cloud, his steps halted—
Long did he linger before departing,"*
I found my own eyes brimming with tears.

**Chapter Twenty-Eighth: The Monkey King’s Troops Gather in Assembly**
**The Black Pine Grove: The Tripitaka Master Meets a Demon**

*Master Wuyi* said in *The Spring and Autumn Annals’ Rectification*:
*"When a subject serves his lord,
If three admonitions are ignored,
There is the ritual of abandonment."*

Indeed, it was out of reluctance to see him punished
That he was merely abandoned and not used.

The Great Sage was exiled after slaying the *Three Corpses*,
Just as one abandoned after three admonitions is suspected—
Thus, the Tripitaka Master relaxed his strictures
And drove him away.

This was a case of *believing slander and distancing virtue*,
Actions misplaced and ill-advised.
Even a mother’s kindness,
Once misapplied, becomes cruel and harsh.

The *qi* of indignation and fury,
Yet sometimes it reaches the heights of reckless and wild excess.
Who is to blame for this?—
Only the flatterers.

When the sovereign’s heart is clouded by confusion,
And chaos stirs within and without,
All stand in peril—
How deeply this should be feared!

This is the source of the themes *"Gathering in Assembly"* and *"Encountering a Demon"*—
The guiding thread of the tale.
*Yì* means what is fitting in conduct.
The bandits slaughtering common folk—
Their wickedness is extreme!
Yet why call it *"Gathering in Assembly"*?
Because the lord above values *virtue* (仁),
And none below dare oppose what is deemed *righteous* (義).
If the lord above deems non-slaying of demons *virtue*,
Then those below must surely deem slaying the innocent *righteousness*.

When *virtue* and *violence* lead the charge,
Then there is a pattern, a natural call—
The forces of destruction are summoned.
Yet thus it is:
The bandits’ *"Gathering in Assembly"* was not the Great Sage’s doing,
But the Tripitaka Master’s influence that made it so;
The Great Sage’s slaughter of the hunter was not his own act,
But the Tripitaka Master’s will that drove him to it.
To gather and to slay—
Originating in *violence*, yet justified by *virtue*;
To stop the killing, yet to open the door to more—
Evil flourishes within the guise of good.

To gather and to slay—
Emerging from the Monkey King,
Yet consummated by Eight Rules.
To exterminate demons is *not* *virtue*,
Yet to assemble them may be deemed *righteous*—
Good concealed within the cloak of evil.

Alas!
In this world, evil is indeed not to be done,
Yet good is also not to be done;
Good can be twisted into evil,
And evil can be dressed as good—
Such is the way of things!

The author sets forth his intent in *"Remodeling Flower Fruit Mountain"* to reveal how contradictions in taking and discarding, and distortions of beauty and ugliness, lead to inevitable harm—whereupon those between high and low cling to *virtue* and seize *righteousness*, inciting chaos and committing sins without restraint. What sorrow their ruin brings!

When the Pilgrim was banished back to Flower Fruit Mountain and gathered demons to kill men, it was as if those who rebelled became compliant, and those compliant turned to rebellion—how could this not betray the Buddha’s sincere intent to tame the Monkey King’s rebellious heart?

The Great Sage said:
*"A thousand days of good deeds leave virtue still insufficient;
One day of evil leaves evil in excess."*
Though these words reflect the Great Sage’s reflection, they are truly the Tripitaka Master’s own confession.

He who confesses his own crimes and invites demons upon himself—
The root of his suffering lies in *"heeding deceitful nature and unleashing the heart-monkey."*

This *"unleashing the heart"* is yet another layer deeper than the earlier *"unleashing the heart"*—
Not the *"unleashing"* that casts aside good for evil,
But the *"unleashing"* of failing to discern *righteousness* and *virtue* deeply enough,
Whereby evil is taken for good and good for evil.
Only those whose *righteousness* is refined and *virtue* mature can grasp this truth,
While the vulgar and deluded cannot fathom it superficially.

The profound allegory and wondrous symbolism of this chapter,
All centered on *"Yellow Robe Lord"* as its core,
Truly extends through to the thirty-first installment,
When the Beautiful Monkey King returns to Flower Fruit Mountain and dons the saffron-yellow robe.

In the Dao of the Golden Elixir,
Gold is the husband, Wood the wife—
Harmonized and united, neither can dominate.
Now the Beautiful Monkey, having been banished, covets the Wolf’s seat,
Abandoning the Golden Lord for the Wooden Mother—
Chaos and inversion prevail.
He who once opened the way to Flower Fruit Mountain and offered the Yellow Robe,
Now, banished to Flower Fruit Mountain, yields his throne to the Yellow Robe.

Why?
Because Gold has waned while Wood has flourished.

Within this tale, the Yellow Qi Mother falls into ruin,
while the Red Boy faces peril—
the Great Dao has already plunged into the City of Delusion,
and none can rouse or rescue it.

The Monkey King, with no other choice,
thus returns to his roots and origin,
gathers righteous allies to plot his restoration—
could he truly forget his own nature,
so casually abandoning the Triple Treasure?

What is meant by *"Yellow Robe Lord"*?

The constellation *Kui* belongs to Wood and overcomes Earth.
He who is overcome by me is my wife—
Earth’s hue is yellow, thus the Yellow Qi Mother;
he who overcomes me is my husband—
Wood overcomes Earth, thus the Yellow Robe Lord.

*"Robe"* signifies Wood encasing Earth from without,
forming the garment of yellow soil—
and when the Yellow Robe is donned,
it symbolizes seizing the moment to exercise power.

His depiction of the demon’s form,
as *"Green Face Blue Hands"*,
reflects Wood’s verdant hue.

As for Tang Seng, having ingested the Golden Elixir,
his enlightened spirit is now obscured—
his nature has fallen into the City of Delusion,
a state of being alive yet drawn toward death.

Just as one lost in the Black Pine Forest,
stumbling in a daze,
unaware of retracing his steps,
and blundering into the Yellow Mire’s wicked domain.

That fiend, hearing he was a monk,
laughed aloud: *"This is a ‘snake’s head, a fly’s fate—
clothing and food it shall be!"*

Then he roared with mirth: *"I said you were a highborn traveler,
and indeed you are! Now I shall devour you!
As you are destined for my feast,
I must strike you down!"*

The demon’s grip is unyielding—
he cannot be let go, nor can he escape.
Such words all expound the meaning:
*"Heaven’s path is shunned, yet hell’s gate is forced—
a proverb’s truth: ‘Yama does not summon, yet he comes to surrender.’"*

Thus, he summoned both disciples and attendants,
horses and baggage—all at once—
while the flesh of the *Soul-Stabilizing Stake*
was nearly swallowed whole by the *Star of Greed’s* maw!

Master Tripitaka’s life was already forfeit,
yet Sha Wujing still sought the alms-giver,
greedy for worldly flavors—
like a fool still lost in dreams,
bewildered and dim-witted,
unaware that the true master was already lost.

Only when they reached *"Bowl Mountain, Moon-Cave"* did they realize it was a demon’s domain—
a vessel of devouring, sucking in tongues like sustenance.

The cave, a den of *"Skin"* and *"Moon,"*
was a place where broken, rotting limbs
were truly the birthplace of human flesh—
and its final resting ground as well.

What is given to the master returns to the master,
what is taken from others returns to them.
While he craves my flesh,
I seek to turn his alms into my own—
yet fools of the world, when will you awaken?
Swiftly strike with ruthless force,
and battle this old demon to the end!

**The Twenty-Ninth Chapter**
*Escaping the River’s Peril to Reach the Realm*
*The Eight Precepts’ Grace in Exile Among the Mountains*

A sage once spoke:
*"Obscure and dark, yet within it lies essence;
Fleeting and vague, yet within it lies purity.
Its purity is most true, within it lies faith."*

In this chapter, the **Hundred-Flower Shame** of the **Treasure-Elephant Kingdom**, seized by a demon as a false couple, vanished without trace. Yet fate brought her to the **Tang Monk**, who carried letters and messages in return—
a tale of destiny unfolding.

Thirteen years prior, on the **Mid-Autumn Night of the Thirteenth Year of Zhenguan**—when the stars aligned with *"Zhenguan Year Thirteen, Auspicious Autumn Day"*—the journey for the **Sutra** was truly a quest for **Treasure**. When the heart first set out, the Treasure had already taken form. As the saying goes:
*"When the mind is set, the **Mysterious Pearl** manifests its image."*

Thus, though the **Tang Monk** wandered in obscurity and illusion,
unaware, **true faith** subtly permeated his path.

This was the very year and month when the **demon ensnared the Princess**—
when the chapter began:
*"Delusion cannot be forcibly extinguished,
True **Dao** need not be desperately sought."*
Meaning:
*"To sever delusion only deepens suffering,
To turn toward **Suchness** is itself a deception."*

If one but aligns a single thought with **True Practice**,
all defilements vanish—
and the moment of **delusion and awakening** is instantly clear.

Yet now, the **Tang Monk**’s single thought remained lost in confusion,
ignoring the **Golden Essence**,
lost in his **original nature**,
just as when he had been adrift in the river’s peril—
bound like an ignorant child to the **Soul-Stabilizing Stake**,
abandoned as an infant, floating on a board,
life hanging by a thread,
lost in darkness and illusion,
a masterless wanderer.

Who knew that within this chaos,
the **Princess**’s question arose—
for **Earth** harmonizes the **Four Symbols**,
secretly birthing **Metal** from its depths.

From this moment, **faith** subtly connected,
and the river’s peril could not be escaped.
**Water** and **Earth** converged,
and the **Golden Princess** returned.

**Earth**’s function was true—
the **Princess of the **Kun Palace****.

**Zhu Yang** said:
*"The Five Phases and Four Symbols rely entirely on Earth,
The Three Elements and Eight Trigrams cannot do without **Ren**."*
Without **Ren**, the Three Elements and Eight Trigrams cannot form,
without **Earth**, the Four Symbols and Five Phases cannot unite.

This **Princess of Kun** was the one who saved the **River’s Peril**.
Yet **Ren-Water** thrives in **Shen**,
and must pass through **Earth’s Shen** to complete the **Kun** form—
only then could **demons be dispelled and awakening preserved**.
The **Monkey of Shen** relies on **Earth** to act—
its meaning is profound.

**Eight Precepts** and **Sha Wujing** could not prevail in battle,
for **Wood** cannot subdue **Wood**—
yet **Wood** can subdue **Earth**.

**Hundred-Flower Shame** was the **Literary Leader of the Ladies’ Class**,
while **Third Princess** was the **Young Maiden of Kun Palace**.
The **"Treasure-Elephant Kingdom"** was the direction where **Geng-Metal** emerged—
truly the **key path** for the **Sutra Journey**.
The **"Soul-Stabilizing Stake"** was the **hidden meeting** where **incense-faith** was transmitted—
the true **target** for saving the master.

When battle raged,
a sudden cry rang out—**"Yellow Brother, abandon your blade and cease fighting!"**—
for **Earth** governs **stillness**.

First, the **Tang Monk’s** bonds were undone,
then the **false dream of the Golden Spirit** came to fulfill its vow and rescue the monk—
**deception made real**.

The verse reads:
*"Narrowly escaped the **Green-Faced Beast**,
Fortunately met **Hundred-Flower Shame"**—
to show that **Wood**, bearing green hues, became a spirit,
while **Flower**, leading the **Spring Festival**, bore **faith**.

**Faith** is **Earth of the Mind**.
The **Young Maiden of Kun**, having given birth and nurtured,
is called **"Baba"** when a woman reaches maturity—
she who mediates between husband and wife, the **matchmaker**.
Thus, the **Princess** is the **Yellow Baba**;
the **Tang Monk** is the **Innocent Child**.

A mother must protect her child—
thus, **faith in action** brings escape from peril.
A child must care for its mother—
thus, **faith’s arrival** keeps the monk behind.

The king received the letter and immediately asked his ministers and generals, *"Who will save the Princess?"* No one answered—truly a case of **wooden idols and clay statues** without resolve. For **Wood** cannot cut **Wood**, nor can **Earth** overcome **Earth**; what was already suppressed must rely on the **justice of the Golden Spirit**. Even the **Wood Spirit** like Eight Rules and the **Earth Spirit** like Sha Monk are but one-sided forces, unable yet to triumph decisively. The **rebellious demon** must be countered by none other than the **Golden Spirit**, and they must urgently devise a plan to return.

The ministers and generals proposed the Tang Monk, who then spoke of his disciples. Though they transcend the mundane and exhibit extraordinary transformations, how could they ever meet the true **Golden Spirit** and stand alone to achieve merit? Eight Rules, though master of great transformations, remains bound to **Wood**. The Foolish One said:
*"The east wind may yet suffice,
The west wind will soon be enough—
But if the south wind rises,
It will blow the heavens into a gaping hole."*

The text calls this **"foolish speech,"**
yet it is the truth.

Why? Eight Rules is the **mother of Wood**—
when the east wind first grows strong,
the west wind fades away;
but at the height of summer,
when the south wind blazes red,
it can surge to the skies and ascend straight—
this is the true principle of transformation.

Eight Rules drank wine in gratitude and ascended the clouds first;
Sha Monk drank wine to aid and urged the clouds to hasten.
**Water and Earth** united in heart,
and together they shattered the demon’s lair.

This is the logic:
*"He who seeks to conquer my strength must save my strength,
And he who seeks to conquer my strength must be overcome by my strength."*
Yet they could not escape this fate.

Eight Rules, though exerting no greater power,
was ensnared in the wilderness,
betraying the king’s favor.
Sha Monk, caught off guard,
was trampled and bound—
losing the support of his limbs.

Eight Rules is **Wood**;
the Yellow Baba is **Earth**.
**Wood** cannot save **Earth**,
yet it could shelter itself by clinging to **Wood**—
thus, the man slept peacefully in the vines.

Sha Monk is **Earth**;
the Yellow Demon is **Wood**.
When **Wood** prevails, **Earth** is ensnared,
yet even in bonds, it could swiftly be freed by its master.

Alas! The Princess,
the **Earth of Kun’s Palace**,
is the **inner Yellow Baba**;
Sha Monk,
the **Earth of Flowing Sands**,
is the **outer Yellow Baba**.
Both **Earths** entered the cave—
though divided as inner and outer,
they share the same **qi**,
with wondrous mutual aid and harmony.
Read the next installment to see this unfold.

**The Thirty-First Chapter:** *The Demon Invades the Dharma, the Horse Remembers the Monkey, the Ape Recognizes the Mind.*

The Sage said:
*"He who masters the Yellow Divide must regulate the spleen;
He who understands the body’s treatment must honor its root.*
The **Middle Palace** nourishes the hundred bones—
when the spleen is regulated, illness is cured;
**the people’s lives** are the extreme foundation of all transformations—
when the root is steadfast, the nation is secure.

If **original qi** is not strong,
and **evil qi** invades the organs,
people blame **evil qi** for the harm,
yet it is not **evil qi**—
they themselves weaken **original qi** and invite it.

If **internal warfare** is not quelled,
and **external warfare** presses the gates,
people rage at **external warfare** for its calamity,
yet it is not **external warfare**—
they themselves create **internal warfare** and brew it.

Thus, the **demon’s** reckless actions
can submerge the **Dharma** and harm the **Law**,
while **desire** without a master
cannot follow the heart and obey commands—
such is the inevitable force.

The **Daoist practitioner** follows the same principle
as treating illness or governing a nation.
When **Central Earth** is lost,
the **returning nature of Metal** is thwarted,
the mind is confused and life in peril—
this is its natural course.

The old demon abandoned Sha Monk in anger,
fuming over the news of the Princess’s letter,
knowing well that **external chaos stems from internal warfare**,
yet unaware that the Princess’s **faith**,
the **faith of returning to the Dharma**,
was the true **faith**.
The demon’s blade, raised to strike,
was also an attempt to let **evil submerge the Dharma**.

The Princess clung to life in defiance,
her **faith** unshaken.
Yet once **faith** had taken action,
speaking truth would lead to ruin—
for there are matters in the world
where **faith** need not be spoken to prove itself.
This is their kind.

Sha Monk’s prevarication on their behalf
was not **faith**,
yet once **faith** had taken action,
pointing to reality would bring harm—
for there are principles in the world
where one may lie with words
without faulting the heart’s **faith**.
This is their kind.

The Princess and Sha Monk,
united in **faith**,
transformed and harmonized as one **qi**,
mutually saving and protecting each other.
The master saves the monk,
the monk saves the master,
the master saves the monk again,
the monk saves the master again—
a ceaseless cycle,
darkly yet effectively at work,
ultimately achieving great success,
all from the **true and unerring nature of faith**.

The Half-Mountain Sage once said:
*"Knowing deceit as deceit,
yet deceit becomes truth."*
This is the Princess and Sha Monk’s **trickery of the demon** and **coaxing of the demon**.

*"Recognizing deceit as truth,
even truth becomes deceit."*
This is the Tang Monk and Eight Rules’ **driving away the monkey** and **transforming into the tiger**.

In days past, the Great Sage endured the **oppression of the Second Prince** and fled as a **tiger in flight**—
this was of his own volition.
The Second Prince swiftly used the **mirror of demon-revealing**,
branding the Sage as a demon.

Now, the Tripitaka Master suffers the **Yellow Demon’s** calamity and is trapped as a **tiger in a cage**—
this was not of his own volition.
The Yellow Demon slowly wielded his **crafty tongue**,
turning **good into evil**.

The root of their misfortune
lies in the Tripitaka Master heeding Eight Rules’ **slanderous words**,
and thus wrongly exiling the **pilgrim**—
so the pilgrim returned to **Flower-Fruit Mountain**,
grieving over the Second Prince’s **oppression**.
Consequently, the king also misplaced trust in the Yellow Demon’s **crafty speech**,
wrongly recognizing his beloved son-in-law,
and the Tang Monk was detained in **Treasure-Elephant Realm**,
while the Yellow Demon’s **magical obstruction** ensnared him.

The king took the old demon as his ideal son-in-law,
and the holy monk as a ferocious tiger—
just as the Tripitaka Master mistook the **White Bone** for a **beautiful maiden**,
and the **demon-slaying** for **harming the good**.

Why did the old demon suddenly shift from fury to joy
after the Princess’s letter and Sha Monk’s persuasive arguments?
It was not merely that he was truly fooled by the Princess and Sha Monk—
he also turned their **faith** against them,
using this very **faith** to deceive the kingdom
and devour the monk.
He suppressed his petty anger,
hoping to sell his grand treachery.

Thus, the Princess held a feast to calm her fright,
yet the demon suddenly changed his attire—
claiming to visit the kingdom to meet kin,
only to transform into a scholar at court.

How marvelous! How wondrous!
The Immortal Sage’s hidden meaning
subtly warns future rulers:
those who judge men by words alone,
bestowing empty honors,
even seizing power,
drowning in wine and lust without restraint,
devouring the innocent without remorse,
and betraying loyal ministers while defying the sovereign.

How so?
The **Kui constellation** is the celestial **Literary Star**,
while the yellow robe is the earthly **armor of the Yellow Emperor**.
*"On the fifteenth night of the eighth month, the Princess was taken away"*—
clearly, the osmanthus blossoms fell beneath the moon’s glow.
*"With an arrow, he shot the tiger to save the Princess,
yet the tiger spirit disguised itself as a pilgrim seeking scriptures."*
A web of flowery deceit,
resembling the eloquent strategies of the **Golden Gate examinations**.

At court, he spewed **Dharma-water**,
instantly stripping the monk of his true form—
fangs and claws bared, devouring the **Treasure Hall**,
his words could weave a **embroidered tiger** from his mouth.

Feasting on delicate maidens,
he relied on the **Divine Steed’s** swordplay—
yet met his match with a **full-court flush** in the leg.
Truly, his hands could cleave a **carved dragon**,
his words as they were, his deeds as they were—
a scholar without virtue—
how could he not be feared?

Thus, the virtuous do not elevate men by speech alone,
while the sage ruler must judge by **truth and sincerity**.
**Truth** is the unerring, the unfeigned.

The four seasons follow the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth without fail,
just as the tides of rivers and seas rise and fall at their appointed times without error.

When the Five Relationships lack **truth**, they collapse;
when the hundred virtues lack **truth**, they perish.
Thus, when ruler and subject share the same **virtue**, governance flourishes,
and when husband and wife align their hearts, progeny thrive.
Yet if superiors and inferiors deceive one another,
and inner and outer circles resort to deceit,
there has never been one who did not meet ruin—
body lost, family destroyed, nation fallen.

**"Truth"** is the word of a person,
springing from the heart and governed by the mouth.
When words do not come from sincerity, they become **deceitful speech**;
when falsehoods flow from the lips, they become **long-tongued slander**.
Deceitful speech confuses the ears,
while slanderous tongues topple cities.
Because of **embroidered tigers** woven from lies,
Qu Yuan drowned himself in loyal grief,
and because of jealous slander,
Bai Qi died on a peak of filial betrayal.

To invert right and wrong,
a deer may be called a horse;
to confuse true and false,
a boar may be mistaken for a pig.
Even the golden cicada transforms into a ferocious beast,
and boundless affection turns into a blade of cruelty—
all are harms wrought by the **tongue-demon**.

That the **Three Treasures** turned into a tiger—
what is there to find strange in that?
Yet the old demon, recognizing kin,
first used the pretense of hunting tigers as a means,
his words skillfully planted.

In general, deceitful men advance their schemes
by first feigning intimacy;
once intimacy is feigned, flattering words find easy purchase,
then they seek to establish merit;
through merit, favor is secured.
Thus, smooth-tongued flattery ensnares the golden-headed monk in an iron cage,
while sharp-tongued venom devours the green-faced demon in song and dance.
When such words arise,
who does not weep in sorrow?
Once a horse’s servant,
how could one not bow in submission?
The Small Dragon manifested from his body,
bowing to save the master—
success or failure, profit or loss,
were not his concern.

Loyal ministers and righteous warriors
should be stirred to action by this.
The Wood Mother’s grief drew him forward,
the Golden Official’s urgency brought him back—
scattered, then reunited;
obscured, then clarified.
Could this not be the work of a single sincere thought,
penetrating near and far?

Marvelous indeed!
The Small Dragon twisted in flattery,
singing and dancing to his desires.
With a sideways glance, he seized the moment—
five flowers, eight gates—
striking when defenses were low.
What difference was there
between the dagger of the **Poisoned Arrow** or the hammer of the **Surfing Wave**?
Though the deed was not yet complete,
it was enough to stir the heart.

Yet when the **full-court flush** struck the dust,
he barely escaped with his life by the river’s waters.
Crouched in endurance, his few companions wailed in grief.
As the poem says:
*"The horse and ape scattered, the golden and wooden withered,
the Yellow Wife parted ways, and **Dao** and righteousness grew thin."*
Truly, a cause for lament.

Eight Rules suddenly awoke from his dream,
hearing the white horse speak with human words.
Recalling the White Tiger Ridge and the White-Boned Lady’s tale,
he knew the tiger’s transformation stemmed from the white bones,
and the yellow robe arose from the white bones.
From constraint came regret,
from regret came enlightenment—
the very mechanism to turn peril into safety.

The Small Dragon spoke:
*"He is a monkey king of **ren** and **yi**,
who will surely seize the demon and save the master."*
This was the appearance of a true person,
while the demon’s evil faded—
the strategy of **End Wood** and **Pure Source**.

With tears dripping from his mouth,
his words were earnest and sincere—
how could Eight Rules not devote himself wholeheartedly?

Eight Rules saw the **Pilgrim**,
then slunk away toward the grassy cliff,
*"sliding and dodging"*—
the utmost in shame and reluctance.

The **Pilgrim** saw Eight Rules,
took his hand and led him to the Water Curtain Cave to play,
demonstrating his lingering affection for seclusion.
Yet because Eight Rules did not speak truly
but instead feigned sincerity,
the **Pilgrim** also pretended reluctance
and withdrew to the groves.

Eight Rules departed—
was he truly gone?
He feigned separation to deliver later words;
the **Pilgrim** did not go—
was he truly unwilling?
He lingered to demand true sincerity.

Eight Rules, after parting, turned back to curse,
his anger driving him to pursue;
the **Pilgrim**, though not leaving, secretly followed,
probing the truth to ensure he did not depart.
Both harbored hidden schemes,
yet neither forgot the master.

Now that the **Pilgrim** had obtained true sincerity,
how could he not reveal his true heart!

---
**Chapter 31: Eight Rules Rouses the Monkey King with Righteousness**
**The Pilgrim Subdues the Demon with Wisdom**

The sage **Treasured One** said:
In **Pali**, *"Shakyamuni"* is the same as the Chinese *"Neng Ren"*—
**"Ren"** governs life, **"Yi"** governs killing.
Killing to protect life,
killing is thus life.
To be able to give life but unable to kill—
that is not **true compassion**.

The **Pilgrim**’s killing of the White Bones was **Yi**,
and truly **Ren**.
Eight Rules deemed it un-**Yi**,
the **Master** deemed it un-**Ren**,
and thus suffered unjust demotion.
This is called **"internal Ren, external Yi"**
—not knowing that **Yi** is **Ren**.

Eight Rules, moved by the Dragon Horse’s earnest admonition,
regretted extinguishing the White Bones,
and knelt to beg the **Pilgrim** to rescue him from his peril—
this was to release **Ren** with **Yi**,
restoring him to his post as **Grand Councilor**,
and granting him authority over life and death.

Thus the Small Dragon said:
*"He is a monkey king of **ren** and **yi**,
who will surely seize the demon and save the master."*
In terms of **Ren** and **Yi**, this was the operation of the **Great Dao**;
in terms of **Metal** and **Wood**, this was the marvel of **elixir alchemy**—
one **yin**, one **yang**,
one husband, one wife,
their inversion and union never to be separated.

**Metal** is **Yi**,
**Wood** is **Ren**.
Wood clings to Metal in obedience to **Yi**,
Metal cherishes Wood in practice of **Ren**.
Mutually beneficial, they achieve the **True Fruit**.
Rooted in **One Nature**,
paired with the **Original Spirit**—
though called brothers,
they share the same **qi**;
though called demons,
they partake of the Five Phases.
If one could sever worldly attachments
and return to the origin,
then **Great Awakening** would be attained.

The opening word of this chapter is most lucid.
Yet the **Dao** of **Ren** and **Yi**
relies on **truth** as its foundation.
To a person, **truth** is as essential
as **water, fire, metal, and wood** are to **earth**.

「Water, fire, metal, and wood cannot generate without earth,
nor can a person stand without **truth**.
The **Pilgrim** rejects the Eight Precepts yet fails to practice them,
for he hates their words being untrue.
Once a word is untrue,
then no bond can be formed,
nor can good deeds be hidden.
Thus, the Monkey King’s decree was delivered:
*"That Eight Precepts is not honest at all!"*
In anger, he seized him back.

The Beautiful Monkey, sparing the **Bodhisattva**’s face,
declared:
*"I will not strike you—
only speak honestly,
do not deceive me!"*
Dishonesty is untruth;
honesty is **truth**.
This corresponds to the **truth** in the Princess’s entrusted letter.

The **Way** of subduing demons and returning to purity
depends on genuine sincerity.
Only this **truth** can turn the tide,
forbidding trickery or deceit.

The **Pilgrim** said:
*"Though my body returns to the Water Curtain Cave,
my heart remains with the **Taking Scripture Monk**."*
A loyal subject, though banished from his kingdom,
cannot bear to forget his lord for a single day;
the Great Sage, though returning to his mountain,
would never endure a day’s neglect of the **Monk**.
Thus, his earlier refusal was not his true intent—
he seized the Eight Precepts only to hasten their journey.

The Eight Precepts, sensing the **Pilgrim**’s intent,
flailed wildly and cried:
*"Look at that empty path—
how splendid to run!"*
Why? Knowing the **Pilgrim** would seize him,
he feigned useless words and instead
adopted the posture of fleeing through the air,
to provoke the **Pilgrim**’s swift resolve
and reveal his genuine sincerity.
This was the **Way**’s subtle art—
a feigned shadow to lure the true spirit.

The tale unfolds:
The Black Pine Grove’s golden pagoda shines;
the Princess entrusts her letter;
the Yellow Robe Demon disguises himself as a refined scholar,
enters the palace to claim kinship with the king,
and transforms the **Master** into a tiger.
The White Horse says:
*"Our elder brother is a man of **Ren** and **Yi**."*
These are the very events and words spoken—
yet the **Pilgrim** remains unaware,
his anger flaring, his heart stirred.

But one provocation alone would not suffice—
why? For the **Pilgrim** was bound by the **Monk**’s command;
the demon was not.
It is as if the **Pilgrim** were a retainer
left by the king to perform duties,
yet not permitted to stay.
Thus, the demon’s insult was enough to rouse him—
if the **Pilgrim** acted for the sake of subduing demons,
not for saving the **Monk**,
or for personal vengeance,
not for the **Monk**’s suffering,
then even without the **Monk**’s command,
he could act.
Hence, the **Pilgrim** feigned compliance to resolve his own dilemma:
*"It is not that I cannot go—
since the demon has insulted me,
I will accompany you!"*
This was the Great Sage’s radiant principle,
his ingenious expedient—
unfathomable to others.

The Great Sage then strode out the gate,
but the monkeys blocked his path.
He explained:
*"I protect the **Taking Scripture Monk**—
this is known throughout heaven and earth.
They did not drive me away,
but sent me home to play in ease."*
Now, this departure seems grand,
yet not truly for the sake of the **Monk** or himself.
Earlier, his rejection appeared as if the **Monk** loved him
and thus banished him,
spared him from toil,
for **Ren** and **Yi** transcend mere paths.
When the **Pilgrim** plunged into the sea to purify himself,
it was to cleanse his heart and thoughts.
The Eight Precepts recognized the **Pilgrim**’s sincerity,
with no ulterior motive.
Now, **Metal** and **Wood** unite,
and **truth** flows between them—
what could not be accomplished?

Yet, a skilled commander avoids the enemy’s sharpest strikes
and strikes where they are weak;
a master of exorcism follows the demon’s wild display,
then seizes its opening.
If one lacks the strength of restraint,
but only the boldness of fury,
advancing too forcefully,
demanding too much,
he will be warned against such recklessness.
Thus, subtlety alone can harmonize all under heaven;
depth alone can fulfill all undertakings.

From ancient times, great heroes
have never subdued demons or dismissed flatterers
without employing wisdom and strategy—
this is how the Great Sage’s intelligence
conquered the Yellow Robe Demon,
embodying the **real practice** of **Ren** and **Yi**.

The **Pilgrim** seized the two minor demons.
To capture the father, he first took the son—
attacking what must be rescued;
to save the mother, he must abandon the son—
removing the cause of her suffering.
To exchange two for one,
while the **Sand Monk** untied the bonds—
this was **earth** saving **earth**.

*"Like milk poured on the head,
sweet dew nourishing the heart—
the moment the truth is revealed,
joy fills the heavens,
spring blooms within the chest."*
This is the **true scene**, not mere embellishment.

The Princess reproached the Pilgrim for lacking integrity, while the Pilgrim countered that the Princess acted unfilially. Both examined Daoist principles at their roots: one feared a husband’s power over her, seeking to preserve her own trustworthiness; the other relied on the Princess’s attachment to him to fulfill his integrity. The Princess entrusted her message to him—an act of filial piety—while the Pilgrim subdued the demon to uphold righteousness and complete her filial duty.

Righteousness fulfills trustworthiness, and trustworthiness fulfills righteousness. Emotion and righteousness unite in strategy, while wisdom acts within. Thus, the Princess concealed herself, and the Pilgrim transformed his appearance.

Wondrous indeed! *"The Pilgrim changed into the Princess’s likeness."*

Gold can overcome water, yet why does it reverse to earth to sweetly endure wood’s dominance? The *Suishu* states: *"Without deceitful tactics, how could one pacify rebels and break through deceit?"*—this is how he fulfilled his trust.

Laozi says: *"The tongue is soft, the teeth hard. The teeth are hard, so they break. The tongue endures without wear because it is soft."* Softness thus accomplishes hardness.

Sunzi says: *"To take what you desire, you must first give it."* Giving is precisely how you take it.

The Pilgrim’s transformation as the Princess—trustworthy yet employing deceit, hard yet yielding softness—embodied the subtle Dao of giving to take. Like a cat dragging a mouse, he wailed pitifully, feigning mercy, mimicking a woman’s heartbreak at parting. Or like a hedgehog in a tiger’s mouth, he acted meekly, hiding his thorns, portraying a husband’s cruelty toward his child, bewitching others with seductive wiles.

He disrupted marriages while pretending to uphold them; he killed children while weeping for them; he stole treasures while devouring them. All was won through wisdom, not by outward appearances.

When the Pilgrim revealed his true form, he transformed into three heads and six arms—changing three oddities into six pairs, restoring the cosmos, aligning Heaven and Earth so all things flourished. This mirrored the *Bua* hexagram’s reversal into *Fu*, the symbol of renewal.

Thus, in the following chapter: *"Tang Seng regained the Monkey King, and they proceeded westward, encountering once more the season of spring."*

The Great Sage drove away the subterranean demon and uncovered the celestial constellation of Kui. The Jade Emperor dispatched his officials to subdue it, and the Princess of the Treasure Elephant’s origins were revealed. In an instant, she was returned to her homeland, where her parents reunited, fulfilling her wish to send the message and Tang Seng’s duty to deliver it. Earlier, through flattery, the water-spraying mouth lost its nature and altered its form; now, with true incantations, the demon’s qi retreated, and its original body was restored. No longer was there the confusion of the White-Bone Lady.

For evil and righteousness diverge, yet the conflict hinges on a single thought. True and false intermingle in enlightenment, ultimately sharing the same source. The Princess’s sincere trust led her from falsehood to truth, exhausting the path.

If one mistakenly takes falsehood for truth, then the demon is not the Sage—even if elixirs are swallowed, it remains like releasing a stolen heart. How could one fail to discern this?

The Great Sage returned to the Three Treasures, though as a disciple returning to his master, it was as if his heart reunited with his body, or a ruler restored to his kingdom—*"When the heart is upright, all is upright; when the ruler is virtuous, all are virtuous."*

Thus, the concluding words: *"The king returns to the treasure hall to stabilize the realm, the monk proceeds to the Thunderclap Peak to seek the Buddha."*

From the twenty-eighth chapter to this point, it is clear that after obtaining the elixir, one must still awaken to nature and clarify the heart. From striving to rest, from labor to ease, gradually reaching the state of *wuwei* and transformation. The meaning will be clear in the subsequent chapters’ dialogues between master and disciples.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Official of Pingding Mountain Delivers the Message, the Wood Mother of the Lotus Cave Meets Disaster**

A disciple of enlightenment said: If one understands the profound meaning of the six characters *"Pingding Mountain, Lotus Cave,"* then the following three chapters—where mountains press down, elixirs are refined, and illusions of Heaven and Earth are fabricated—along with the four chapters involving the As-You-Wish Jewel and the Golden Snare binding Sun Wukong, the gourd containing the Pilgrim, the female Nuwa mending the sky with stone, the banana fan’s true fire, and the bottle containing Sun Wukong—all their mysteries will be revealed.

As for the mountain, why is it called *Pingding*? At the beginning of the chapter, it states: *"The master and disciples were of one heart and body, all heading toward the Western Land."* West refers to the *Xie* (兑) position.

*Xie* is the hexagram of the maiden, depicted as (☵☰☵), three lines: one yin above, two yang below—two metals and one earth.

The three lines of *Kun* (☷) form *Xie*; *Xie* is the maiden, the upper line of *Kun* (☷☵).

Collectively, the six lines of *Kun* represent six hundred *li*. Below *Xie* is (☰☰), two yang lines—belonging to *Qian* (☰), metal—symbolizing the Golden Angle and Silver Angle, representing mountains. When the earth star is level, the metal star forms angles, likening mountains.

The Buddha said: *"I have a treasure hidden in the Form Mountain. Do you all recognize it?"* Master Yuanjue Chan said: *"At the top of the head, shining brightly—this is the Dao without Dao, called the true Dao."* This is like the pearl within the oyster, the profound meaning of Pingding Mountain.

*"Within it is a cave named Lotus."* Flowers are the manifestation of yang qi. The lotus blooms when yin follows the peak of yang, as in the *"Awakening to Reality"* passage: *"Next, the red flower emerges, followed by yin."* And *"The maiden’s flower first blooms in the northern land."*

Since *Xie* is the maiden, she internally nurtures the golden lotus, embodying the Five Treasures, capable of transforming treasures into demons or demons into treasures. Those refining the elixir believe demons possess treasures; by activating their spiritual mechanisms, they can steal the Purple-Gold Gourd. Ultimately, the gourd still belongs to Sun, as demons are transformed into elixir through demonic illusions.

If one doubts that treasures are not demons and complacently indulges in idle speculation, unable to escape the **幌金绳** (deceptive golden noose) and **圈套** (traps), then Tang Seng will still be devoured by the demon’s mouth—thus, transforming humans into demons through human illusions.

The Master Ziyou said:
*"The righteous practicing evil methods will see those methods return to righteousness;
The wicked practicing righteous methods will see those methods return to wickedness."*
Upside and downside, forward and backward—all arise from this, entering and exiting one another. Only when the **灵台** (numinous platform) is clear and one thoroughly understands the core principle will there be no doubt or fear.

Thus, I specially cite a few lines from the *Heart Sutra* to guide the lost.

Again, fearing that one may not grasp the *Heart Sutra*’s profundity—without first establishing a foundation—yet hastily rushing toward non-action—I also cite:
*"After completion of the work, when causes cease and the method becomes empty, naturally the body attains ease,"*
to clarify the sequence of effects.

The **功曹** (official of merit) transforms into a woodcutter to deliver the message.
This message elucidates the **宝象国** (Treasure-Elephant Kingdom)’s **百花羞** (Hundred-Flower Shame), emphasizing the infallibility of year, month, day, and hour to record the truth of its transmission, thus tightly linking it to the preceding passage as a guiding outline.

The most awakening phrase is *"must be in a stupor."* Why?
The *Rites* say: *"A bride is wed at dusk."* This signifies the union of yang departing and yin arriving.
Adding the maiden to marriage—few do not become stuporous upon marriage. To encounter this demon without stupor is impossible in this world.
The *Odes* say: *"That stupor is not wisdom."*
And again: *"Behold your dazed state."*
Truly deserving of tears and lamentation.
The Pilgrim weeps once, now wishing to recruit a heart-friend to jointly refine this demon.

For if one is weak in strength and solitary in form, then standing before the furnace will be futile;
But with united hearts and cooperative effort, the true fruit can be attained.
The master and disciple understand this at a glance, hence:
*"To cross this mountain, one must have Zhu Bajie."*

The pig is the **亥木** (Hai Wood), and wood can generate fire. If one does not grasp the subtle timing of fire and instead loses heart and scatters their efforts, how can they gather and apply their work?
Without Bajie’s fierce support, yet constantly invoking *"scattering the fire,"* this is the first and greatest peril of elixir refinement.
The patrol of the mountain was to exhort students, to probe the hidden truths within, and to caution against self-deception that leads to ruin.

The account of Bajie’s deceit and doubt reveals that while people may laugh at his stupidity, they fail to recognize that it mirrors the deluded misconceptions of all students under demonic influence—worthy of tears. Thus, the Pilgrim coldly laughs in place of weeping.
This cold laughter is more painful than tears.

The immortal master, fearing readers might not grasp the figurative depiction, specially adds the phrase *"drawing shadows and depicting forms,"*
—one to show the **Dao/Way’s** divine essence, the other to convey the figurative intent.
If one says, *"This is the marvelous method of capturing the spirit through depiction!"*
Does it truly describe Bajie’s stupidity?
One must truly comprehend the **red grass slope** where he stretches his waist—his heart in stupor and vision obscured;
The **woodpecker’s beak bleeding**—his heart in stupor and speech unguarded;
The **flying ear** struck again—his heart in stupor and hearing dull.
With the three external treasures (eyes, ears, mouth) failing, his heart’s obstinacy has already turned to stone.
He takes the **Stone Monkey** as teacher and friend, yet the mountain and cave are all stone.
*"My heart is not stone,"* yet he claims there is gold within, mistakenly pointing to the gold vein and recklessly guessing *"nailing iron leaves to the door."*
Is this the true meaning of the *Heart Sutra*?
*"Old Pig’s heart is flustered and cannot recall the truth"*—a concise summation.

With the three internal treasures (mind, breath, spirit) failing, his heart’s doubt has already turned to a ghost.
The tiger passes, the wind blows, the crows call—animals, plants, and all things are ghosts.
*"Loading a cart with ghosts,"* yet not personally receiving direct instruction, he assumes he can forcibly guess transformations and attain the demon’s perverse heart-realm by himself.
Self-surprised and self-blamed—what fault is there with others?

The **golden and silver kings** of Pingding Mountain’s Lotus Cave—are they not present before one’s eyes?
Once captured by a single drumbeat, they suffer misfortune—all due to failing to grasp the true message of fire timing and instead blindly acting in error.

The immortal master, embodying Heaven’s teachings, uses the metaphor of *"drawing shadows and depicting forms"* to illustrate the image of the **dragon-horse bearing the diagram**, revealing the source of the Dao, hence *"five mouths linked to the horse."*
The master and disciple’s single diagram clarifies the *River Diagram*’s **three-five** essence, all emanating from the **太极** (Supreme Ultimate).

Ah! These few words of profound mystery are difficult to describe—yet a single brushstroke of vermilion and indigo captures the marvelous transformation.

After carefully studying the last three sections, one attains their profundity.

**Thirty-Third Chapter: External Path Misleads True Nature, Original Heart Assisted by the Primordial Spirit**

Master Yu-Yi said:
The **Dao/Way** of the **golden elixir** originates from the *Zhou Yi* (Book of Changes) **Eight Trigrams**, which in turn originate from the *River Diagram*.
Heaven does not cherish the Dao, so the **dragon-horse bore the diagram** and emerged, guiding the ages of confusion—this is the *"true scripture without words."*

The *Lo Shu* diagram: **one, nine, three, seven** occupy the four cardinal directions;
**two, four, six, eight** occupy the four corners;
**five** resides at the center.
For **gold and water** generate each other—**Heaven One** and **Earth Four** combine as **one-five**;
**wood and fire** generate each other—**Earth Two** and **Heaven Three** combine as **one-five**;
**earth’s number** resides at the center, as **one-five**.
The Five Phases gather and harmonize—**three-five**’s wondrous convergence—an endless cycle of primordial essence.

Yet:
**Heaven One** generates water, **Earth Six** completes it;
**Earth Two** generates fire, **Heaven Seven** completes it;
**Heaven Three** generates wood, **Earth Eight** completes it;
**Earth Four** generates metal, **Heaven Nine** completes it;
**Heaven Five** generates earth, **Earth Ten** completes it.
The logic of generation unfolds in forward and reverse, hidden and revealed, beyond measure—all due to the **先天真一之气** (preheavenly true unity qi) spiraling within.

The adept cultivates the elixir, knowing the Five Phases in their **sequential order**—wood can generate fire;
knowing the Five Phases in **reverse order**—the mother conceals the child in the womb.
Yet fire can in turn generate wood, for within the yang lies the true yin—**the profound mystery of Heaven Three generating wood**.

The adept knows the Five Phases in their **sequential order**—metal can generate water;
knowing the Five Phases in **reverse order**—the child returns to produce the mother.
Yet water can in turn generate metal, for within the yin lies the true yang—**the genuine essence of Earth Four generating metal**.

Those who understand this are called **enlightened**, not deceived by external Daoist teachings;
those who attain this are called **divine**, not exceeding the primordial origin’s inherent power.

Zǐ Yóu said:
*"To exhaust one’s heart is to know one’s nature;
to know one’s nature is to know Heaven."*

The knowing know this, the exhaustive exhaust this—nothing more.

The metaphors within this passage—**embedding Heaven** and **releasing Heaven**—are but **the universe within a sleeve, sun and moon in a jar**, fundamentally no stranger than the ordinary.

The **Immortal Master** expounds these principles to reveal their subtleties, disseminating them widely among both refined and common folk, so that the wise and foolish alike may witness them and thus hope to **grasp their meaning intuitively**.

For instance, at the passage’s outset:
*"Taking the Eight Precepts into the cave"*—the Eight Precepts, wood by nature, are **restrained by Heaven Four’s metal**.
Immersed in the **Pure Water Pool**—
the Eight Precepts, wood containing fire, are **subdued by Earth Six’s water**, thus **encountering demonic forces in their natural order**.

Examining the diagram:
**San Zàng** represents the **Supreme Ultimate**.
*"Only seeing auspicious clouds wafting and celestial qi swirling"*—this is the **intermingling of Heaven and Earth’s primordial vapors**.
*"The traveler before the horse drops his talismans—above three, below four, left five, right six"*—
if taken literally as a **superficial interpretation of the text’s constraints**, one loses its **profound meaning**.
If the talismans are understood as **three odd and four even, five flowers and six doors**, one also misses their **true essence**.

The **talismans before the horse** properly demonstrate the **Dragon Horse’s *Hé Tú* numbers**.
Heaven Three generates wood, Earth Four generates metal—**three and four** are the **metal and wood** in union.
Metal and wood **converge through earth**, hence **left five** is Heaven Five generating earth,
and **right six** is Earth Six completing water.

The **essence of refining the elixir** is thus **comprehensively outlined in the entire diagram**.

Yet, **Three envelops Heaven One**—**Heaven One generates water**—**Earth Two generates fire**;
**wood contains water**, **metal contains fire** as well.
**Three and Five interpenetrate**, **Heaven Seven completes** it.
**Metal clings tenderly to wood**, **wood yields to metal**—
**Three and Five interpenetrate**, **Earth Eight completes** it.
**Three and Five combine into One Five**, **One Five combines into One Earth**—
**Three and Six interpenetrate**, **Four and Five interpenetrate**, **Heaven Nine completes** it.
**Wood can generate water**, **metal can generate fire**—
**Four and Six interpenetrate**, **Earth Ten completes** it.
**This exhausts the principles of yin and yang, the Five Phases**, and their **cyclical generation and decline**.

**Five and Six interpenetrate**—**having reached Ten**, they return to One**—
**still One, the primordial *Tài Jí* (Great Polarity)**.
**This encompasses the Dao of reversing perverse applications and restoring harmony**—
**for within it lies the Way**.

**Only here does the *qi* of the Primordial One**—
**swirling above, below, left, and right**—
**reveal itself as an entire *Hé Tú* (River Diagram) and *Luó Shū* (Luo Book),
**a complete *Zhōu Yì* (Book of Changes)**.
**Yet when the elixir discards the path of perverse application**, **its true Dao is already manifest**.

**The stroke of a true immortal’s pen!**
Thus, the demon beholds it and says: *"Words are not in vain—truly authentic."*

The *Fu* (Joy) manifests as the White Tiger—
when the tiger is about to devour a man, it must first humble its posture.

The demon sought to deceive Tang Seng well,
so it first assumed a yielding, humble form,
to trip his footing and disrupt his center—
thus becoming a demon.

For *Fu* is the fifth hexagram of the *Zhōu Yì*,
a transformation of *Shì* (Obstruction)—water and mountain.
*"The traveler bears [the demon] on his back,"*
its *Gèn* (Stopping) aspect—
*Gèn* is mountain, stopping his back,
so he halts and cannot proceed.

Mountain and marsh exchange *qi*—
thus it dispatches the mountain.
When dispatched three times, it becomes three *yīn*,
added to three *yáng*, forming *Tài* (Peace).
The marsh-mountain *Xián* (Binding)—
that is *Dì-Tiān Tài* (Earth-Heaven Peace),
called *"Tài Mountain presses the head,"*
earth above heaven.

The Five Phases of the two realms’ mountains,
the two *qi* of Tài Mountain—
once united in the Primordial,
entering the Post-Heaven—
how could it not stop his back,
halting him from moving?

Thus it seized Sha Wujing and seized Sanzang,
all halted and unable to proceed.

*"The Purple-Gold Red Gourd"*—the *Lí* hexagram, fire,
belonging to the heart, held by the cunning ghost;
*"The Sheep-Fat Jade Pure Bottle"*—the *Kǎn* hexagram, water,
belonging to the kidneys, held by the nimble insect.

*Kǎn* and *Lí* cannot be separated—
using the gold gourd, the jade bottle follows,
by natural law.

*"Bottom up, mouth down"*—
the inverted symbol,
able to reverse and restrain *Lí*-fire so it does not flare upward,
able to melt all true essences—
thus it is Laozi’s treasure for refining the elixir.

Why does it respond when called and enter?
Sound is the *qi* of the heart.
Like sounds attract, like *qi* seeks its match.
As the *Lí* palace’s female call,
it summons the *Kǎn* palace’s male to harmonize.
Thus it can transform elixir into demon,
or demon into elixir.
The marvel of resonance lies only in response or no response,
orthodox or perverse application—
a single breath, a single inhalation.

The Great Sage pressed beneath the Five Phases Mountain—
this is the Dao-heart unable to leave the dust.
This pressing beneath Tài Mountain—
this is the Dao-body unable to leave the world.
Hence the sighs of *"tree too tall," "name too high."*

For those who wish to transcend the dusty cycle,
nothing surpasses embodying the Complete True Dao.
To embody the Complete True Dao,
nothing surpasses refining and ingesting the Golden Elixir.
What is precious is sudden awakening—
then the spirit and clarity naturally arise.
This is the Original Spirit aiding the Dao,
so heavy burdens may be removed,
shoulders’ loads may be set down,
and the Purple-Gold Gourd treasure
no longer manipulated by demons.

The traveler transformed into Old Complete True,
self-proclaimed immortal,
not only saving himself
but wishing to save others—
his magnanimity truly encompasses heaven and earth.

The claim of *"packing heaven"* is not baseless,
yet why cannot heaven truly be packed,
and only the request to *Nèzhā* borrow
True Wu’s black-embroidered banner from the North Heaven Gate,
to obscure the sun and moon of the South Heaven,
to deceive the two demons?

The sage intended another meaning—
thus setting this symbol,
to expose those who falsely claim immortality,
who use the River Chariot to transport water for brain-washing,
deceiving the world with gold and jade treasures,
while obscuring the true, empty nature of the Original Heart.

Those who falsely claim immortality
demand money upon meeting.
Greedy and deluded men
know only of refining gold and silver,
hoping to gain their methods—
even the most meticulous and nimble,
once encountering them,
willingly revere, believe, and submit,
not sparing true treasures,
fearing to be left behind in sincerity.

Though they do not rob in broad daylight,
they truly deceive in darkness.

The traveler transformed into a seven-*cùn* Purple-Gold Red Gourd,
resembling a human form.
The *Zhǎng Fǔ* records:
*"A *cùn* of land, a *cùn* of field—
enough to sustain life."*
The *Huáng Tíng Jīng* says:
*"A *cùn* of land—this is the face,
the space between the brows is the *cùn* used."*
Now it is *"seven *cùn*"*—
thus encompassing the middle field, lower field,
and connecting to the seven orifices.

The human body is also a Purple-Gold Red Gourd—
in measure, it can pack heaven.
If the Golden Elixir is not obtained,
it is but a false form—
a false gourd.
Without the true capacity to pack heaven,
it must resort to deceiving heaven with trickery.

*"Nèzhā treads the Wind-Fire Wheel"*—
comparable to the River Chariot;
*"True Wu’s black banner"*—
comparable to the Dark Water;
*"North Heaven Gate"*—
comparable to the Water Palace;
*"South Heaven Gate"*—
comparable to the Vertex;
*"Sun, moon, stars"*—
comparable to the two eyes.

*"Toss up the gourd, unfurl the black banner,
obscuring sun and moon"*—
comparable to transporting water upward to the vertex,
to brain-wash and close the eyes.

*"Heaven and Earth dyed black, the cosmos stained indigo"*—
is this mere empty talk?
Such methods are truly inking heaven and earth—
like standing on a perilous cliff over the苦海,
one slip, and you plummet into the abyss,
never to return.
Tremendous danger!
Tremendous danger!

「How much better to release the heavens,
and not engage in the trickery of transporting and obscuring—
to let the azure sky and white sun
shine forth with the light of true noon!

Alas, what of those cunning and clever fiends,
who take falsehood for truth as a means to sustain their families and prosper?
They lose their true nature and stray from their original heart—
how pitiable this is!

If readers mistakenly view the Two Demons’ *shifting of mountains* as external Dao deceiving the true,
or the Six Jian’s *transporting of mountains* as the primordial spirit aiding the original heart,
they are superficial in their understanding.

**Chapter 34**
*The Demon’s Clever Scheme Traps the Monkey King*
*The Sage’s Flight Fools the Treasure*

Wuyi Zi said: The *Yin Fu Jing* states:
*"Heaven has five thieves—those who perceive them flourish."*

If a person can perceive them and practice in reverse,
then the cosmos lies within their grasp,
and myriad transformations arise from the heart.
Heaven is the heart.
The five thieves are the five elemental natures inherent within the heart.
Each element manifests its own nature,
and they mutually harm and destroy one another.
My primordial *qi* is all stolen by them,
and the heart of heaven is thus ensnared.

In the passage, the Two Demons declare:
*"We possess five treasures."*
These are the five elemental natures.
If one perceives them,
while the heart discards all illusions,
and the body becomes as vast as the Great Emptiness,
then weapons become treasures;
if one cannot perceive them,
while the heart gives rise to stray thoughts,
and they mutually suppress one another,
then weapons and treasures turn into thieves.

The text concludes with the Sage saying:
*"You old fool, if you let your servants run wild,
you’ll be held accountable for failing to restrain them."*

Lao Jun replied:
*"This has nothing to do with me.
Such trials are the fate your disciples must endure.
Without this, they cannot attain true fruition."*」

Sun Wukong’s heart now understood those words and penetrated their true meaning.

The *"Jade-Gold Red Gourd"* symbolizes the **Li** fire—flaming upward, externally yang yet internally yin. Its fiery nature like a gourd, red in hue, embodies the **Wǔgōng** (Three-legged Crow) and the sun’s essence. The *"Mutton-Fat White Jade Flask"* symbolizes the **Kǎn** water—gentle and moist, externally yin yet internally yang. Its smoothness like jade, white in color, is the **Yùtù** (Jade Rabbit) and the moon’s purity. The *"Seven-Star Blade"* symbolizes the **Jiǎn** (Mountain) and **Duì** (Lake) meeting in metal, the nature of earth and water converging in breath. The *"Banana Leaf Fan"* symbolizes the **Zhen** (Thunder) wood and **Xùn** (Wind) wind, the clash of wind and thunder. The *"Shaking Golden Lasso"* symbolizes the **Qián** (Heaven, firm) and **Kūn** (Earth, yielding)—the two *qi* intertwining, long and short as they will, swaying uncertainly, the very essence of the central land. In form, it encompasses the eight trigrams; in substance, it belongs to the five elements. The mother and child demons each hold one treasure, each embodying its nature, hence their monstrous forms.

The lesser demon, lost in delusion, attempts to usurp heaven, thus losing control of its elemental essence. The blame lies with the celestial assembly for deceiving with falsehoods, unaware of recognizing falsehood as truth. Their error stems from their own missteps—still groping blindly beneath the earth after their failed attempt to usurp heaven, unwilling to abandon the false, fearing the easy loss of truth while clinging to the false.

The Pilgrim transformed into a fly, and the Buddha’s *intention-jewel* also changed with him—this is the true principle. **Kǎn** and **Li**, the roots of creation, give birth to all things; their movement is inevitable. In the demon’s body, they are demonic treasures; in the Buddha’s, they are Buddhist treasures. Even a fly’s body can contain them—how could this be mere empty talk?

The two demons misused **Kǎn** and **Li**, losing their true nature. In anger at the false pretenses of the celestial deceivers, they sought to exploit the *intention-nature* by force, compelling the primordial *qi*. Thus, they begged the Old Mother to obtain the *Shaking Golden Lasso*.

The *lasso* is two strands intertwined, never unified. *Shaking* signifies doubt and confusion in the mind, without certainty. The nine-tailed fox holds it, for foxes are prone to suspicion; nine tails symbolize chaos. The *Chāibā Mountain Tiger* and *Yǐhǎi Dragon* display their mistaken grasp of dragons and tigers, boasting of their supposed prowess in subduing beasts.

The Pilgrim secretly observed their foundation, striking down their strength and transforming their doubt—what is taken for truth may still be false, while what is false may yet be true. Knowing falsehood as false makes it true.

The Pilgrim took the guise of an old nurse entering the cave, and Eight Rules mocked him for exposing his tail, revealing the truth hidden within falsehood—something that cannot be entirely erased. The demon king sought to offer Tang Sanzang’s flesh for longevity, while the Pilgrim demanded to cut off Eight Rules’ earlobes for wine, exposing the urgency of discarding falsehood within falsehood. Both ears must listen keenly.

The True Person’s teachings are not idle; they are not mere objects of ridicule or jest. The Dao of the Primordial does not cling to form or sensation, nor does it fall into perception and hearing. Round and radiant, it bears no trace—neither thread nor particle.

The Pilgrim had no choice but to manifest and disperse, transforming into a crimson glow filling the cave—*gathered, it forms shape; dispersed, it becomes qi*.

As the *Vajra Unveiling* states:
*"If one seeks me through form, or calls me through sound,
That person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata."*

Thus, those ensnared by form and sound remain prey to the tiger’s jaws, while those trapped by names and appearances are but hollow reeds.

When the Pilgrim used the golden lasso to snare the demon king, it became the demon’s own lasso binding its body—how could it escape its own trap? When the demon king used the lasso to snare the Monkey, it was demon confronting demon—how could it harm the Monkey’s slightest hair?

The two demons used the gourd to deceive the Pilgrim, calling him by name—this was seeking the Buddha through sound. Why not answer with false names to their delusion? The Pilgrim, in turn, called the demons from within the gourd—also using sound to deceive them, yet transforming falsehood into truth.

To break the golden lasso, a few strokes with a steel file suffice—wisdom manifests, and knowledge dissolves. To escape the gourd, a few shouts are enough—the physical form vanishes, and compassion pervades universally.

The golden noose tightens around the neck; the light behind it is still an illusion, yet liberation is still needed. The gourd’s darkness hides a treasure yet unrefined—urgent enlightenment is required.

Do not say the gourd belongs to its master by clever artifice—
Better to borrow hands to achieve what comes naturally.
In an instant, it rises—*that is me.*

Thus it is said:
*"Granted your schemes are cunning in a thousand ways,
Yet the gourd still bears the surname Sun."*

Sun Wukong—Wukong Sun. Forward and backward, inverted, all belong to the surname Sun.
Ah! From *"surname Sun"* one awakens to the mystery of sons and grandsons.

Taking **Kǎn** to fill **Li**, returning to the exposed primal *qi*—*"Catch a breath, and you’re off, disguised."*

Fools mistakenly guess this as the art of the bedroom.

**Chapter 35: External Paths Display Power to Deceive True Nature**
**The Monkey King Steals Heaven’s Treasure and Subdues the Demon**

A disciple of enlightenment says: The two young demons stole heaven’s treasures and became demons, turning the five treasures into five thieves. Sun the Great Sage stole heaven’s treasures and subdued the demons, turning the five thieves into five treasures.

The same heavenly treasures, the same act of theft—yet righteousness and evil are utterly distinct, depending solely on whether one cultivates or does not cultivate.

Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth—these are heaven’s treasures, and they are also humanity’s treasures. Heaven’s nature is humanity’s nature. If one exploits their nature one-sidedly, they mutually deceive and suppress each other: fire sees water as a thief, water sees earth as a thief, earth sees wood as a thief, wood sees metal as a thief, and metal sees fire’s force as a thief.

Each thief is a thief to its own nature, each nature is its own nature—yet they lose their true essence. When their natures are harmonized, they mutually generate: metal generates water, and the true yang within water can generate the yin of metal, while the yin of metal in turn can generate the yang of wood, and thus metal and wood intertwine as treasures.

Wood generates fire, and the true yin within fire can generate the yang of wood, while the yang of wood in turn can generate the yin of water, and thus wood and fire are both at their fullest as treasures.

They intermingle as parent and child, alternating as husband and wife, and together they attain their treasures. This is what is called "concentrating the five phases," reversing cultivation and transformation—just as **Nüwa** refined the five-colored stones to patch the sky.

The five-colored stones are earth. The method of cultivation relies entirely on the essence of earth. Earth has no fixed position, yet it governs the four seasons and embodies the central palace;

Fire, through it, does not flare,
Water, through it, does not overflow,
Metal, through it, endures long,
Wood, through it, does not wither.

Thus, *The Awakening to Reality* says: *"The five phases and four symbols rely entirely on earth."*

Metal, wood, water, and fire reside at the four corners,
And when viewed through earth, they are **external Dao**;
Earth dwells in the central palace,
And when viewed through metal, wood, water, and fire, it is **heart-monkey**.

Those who practice **external Dao** wield power
Are one-sided in their exploitation of nature,
Not the true method of **gold elixir**,
Hence they deceive the true essence.

Those who attain treasures with **heart-monkey**
Collect and harvest their treasures,
Obtain the true Dao of **gold elixir**,
Hence they subdue the evil demons.

Two key phrases, most clearly stated.

Readers who rigidly insist that **heart-monkey** is the human mind,
Or shallowly perceive **external Dao** as mere evil demons,
Fail to grasp their meaning.

The opening poem states: *"One’s original nature is round and bright, the Dao naturally flows through."*
A single phrase revealing the entire truth.

It further says:
*"Pure and turbid, how many times they turn with fate,
The eternal and the void, let them wander east and west."*
Illustrating the five phases’ cyclical transformations and the marvel of generation.

Thus it is said: *"This aligns with the Great Sage Sun’s profound Dao."*

The Great Sage Sun is also called **"Xingzhe Sun"**,
With a name that is ever-shifting—up, down, left, right,
Inverted without end—yet encompassing all phases.

He is the **central palace’s yang**,
For the Dao’s body is indeed such.

The **golden rope** of the previous section is also earth,
Yet it is vague and formless,
While the Great Sage Sun obtained its **pure steel’s true gold**.

Because of this true treasure,
He entered the gourd without dissolving,
For earth can quench flames;

Because of this true treasure,
He then obtained the gourd itself,
For fire meets earth and returns to its form;

Because of this true treasure,
He acquired the **jade purity bottle**,
For water sees earth and unifies in chaos;

Because of this true treasure,
He gained the **banana-leaf fan** and **seven-star sword**,
For metal and wood meet earth and intertwine;

Because of this true treasure,
He reversed the **silver angle** and **gold angle**,
For gold and silver meet earth and return to their roots.

The opening line thus declares:
*"The Great Sage Sun attained the true treasure of the demons."*
Linking past and present,
To show that the golden rope is the **true earth of the receptive female**.

This alchemy’s marvel of inverted control
Is akin to Nüwa’s use of earth to repair heaven.

Heaven is the ultimate yang,
Yet within yang there is true yin,
So Heaven One generates water and descends to nourish;

Earth is the ultimate yin,
Yet within yin there is true yang,
So Earth Two generates fire and ascends to blaze.

The **creative male** and **receptive female** are likewise.

The **Dao Ancestor of Highest Venerability**,
With the yang of the central palace,
Repairs the deficiencies of the creative palace,
And enlightens all ages.

The **"one stalk of immortal vine beneath the Kunlun Mountains’ foot, bearing this jade-red gourd"**
Is the supreme treasure for nurturing the elixir,
And must not be overlooked.

By reasoning, originally there were two—male and female.
Yet the female within the male is false,
While the male within the female is true.

The female cannot contain,
For the false cannot form the elixir;

The male can contain,
For the true can form the elixir.

*"Base upward, mouth downward"*
Is the logic of inverted correspondence.

When the silver angle is contained and shaken,
It is white gold entering the fire palace,
Transforming into one breath—

That is *"Gathered and returned to one place,
Turning into a pool of water."*

The progression now reaches **"King Wen of the Zhou, Confucius, and other sages"**
As the alchemists of old expound this principle,
Revealing its origin.

The silver angle contained within the gourd and transformed
Is not death,
But the demons returning to their true nature—
This is the act of **receiving life**.

Eight Precepts said: *"Do not weep, let your younger brother recite the ‘Receiving Life Sutra.’"*
Not mere idle words.

The method of elixir-making
First forges white gold as the elixir’s seed,
While the **gentle wind** aligns with fire’s rectitude at this moment.

Fire is not ordinary fire,
But the breath of **purple charcoal**—
The five phases’ natural transformations and their arranged operations.

The **Old Demon’s fury in his heart** reveals the timing of fire’s function.

Placing the **jade purity bottle** aside and using the fan and sword instead
Is the **gentle wind shaking the wood**, the **thunder emerging from earth**, and the **rising of the earth’s vigor**.

*"Gazing at the southern homocletic fire of Bing-Ding’s fan,
Only flames erupt from the ground—
Fierce and towering, scorching the sky and searing the earth"*
Marks the advance of the **yang fire**.

The Great Sage Sun avoided the fire,
Entering the **Lotus Flower Cave** to take the **ram-fat jade purity bottle**;
The Old Demon retreated to the **stone table**, drowsy and silent;
The Great Sage Sun quietly extracted the **banana-leaf fan**,
Revealing the retreat of the **yin symbol**.

The brilliance lies in the lines:
*"Causing gold and fire not to meet,
The five phases to disorder and harm the harmonious qi."*

Readers assume the **gold angle** is metal,
And **heart-monkey** is fire,
That metal and fire contend,
A common principle of suppression.

Yet they fail to see:
The **Monkey King hides gold and water**,
The **gold angle sits within wood and fire**;

「Water bears the **qi** of generating gold,
Fire bears the **qi** of generating wood;
Gold and wood share the **qi** of mutual support,
Wood and fire embody the **qi** of *jiéjì* [fulfilled/accomplished].

When gold and water intermingle, and water and fire are reconciled,
If gold and wood do not unite, then gold and fire do not contend,
And the lines—*"The five phases disorder and harm the harmonious qi"*—hold true.

Those who cultivate the **elixir** [丹 *dān*] seek not for gold and fire to contend.
When gold and fire contend, the five phases naturally flourish.
*"The Old Demon, defeated in battle, directly went to the Southwest to suppress the Dragon’s Retreat"*—
Seeking life from the source of my birth, pointing to *"Southwest gains a companion"* [得朋 *dé péng*];
Thus, he gained the aid of **Huli Seven** [狐阿七].

*"Huli Seven united as one, directly coming from the Northeast"*—
Returning to the source from where death comes, pointing to *"Northeast loses a companion"* [丧朋 *sàng péng*];
Thus, he fell to the **cudgel of Zhu Bajie** [猪八戒之钯 *Zhū Bājiè zhī yā*].

With both the **yang fire** and **yin symbol** exhausted,
The **gold angle** [金角 *jīn jué*] naturally returns to its origin.
The Great Sage Sun removed the **ram-fat jade purity bottle**,
Enveloped the Old Demon, and called out, *"Gold angle!"*
In response, it vanished without a trace.

Breath and resonance in harmony, no need for exertion;
*"Recalled the Seven-Star Sword, sweeping away all evil"*—
All were true uses of **earth** [真土 *zhēn tǔ*].

Seizing the moment unexpectedly,
Naturally unfolding the **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机],
Not through force, but the very essence—
This is the true meaning of *"gold and fire contending without harming the harmonious qi."*

The **Highest Venerable** [太上] transformed the **blind man** [瞽者 *gǔ zhě*],
Demanding the return of the five treasures,
And explaining the cause of their theft:
*"Without this, the **true fruit** [正果 *zhèng guǒ*] cannot be attained."*

He said that without seeing these five thieves,
One remains like the **blind man**;
But if one can reclaim these five treasures,
Then the **fruit** [果 *guǒ*] is secured.

Transforming thieves into treasures and enduring hardships,
This is the inevitable path of those who cultivate the **Dao** [修道者 *xiū dào zhě*].
What concern does the **Highest Venerable** have in this?

*"From the gourd and the jade purity bottle, two streams of **celestial qi** [仙气 *xiān qì*] poured forth,
Once again transforming into the two **gold and silver children** [金银二童子 *jīn yín èr tóng zǐ*].*
Returning to its original nature and essence,
All is but one **gold** [一金 *yī jīn*].

This is precisely—
*"Floating and elusive, all return to Tiāntóu Palace [兜率宫],
Free and unbound, ascending straight to Dàluó Heaven [大罗天]."*
The marvelous effect of the **gold elixir** [金丹 *jīn dān*] is such.

Aspiring cultivators must urgently seek the secrets within
The **Lotus Flower Cave** on **Flat-Top Mountain** [平顶山莲花洞].

Yet then—
The treasure of the **gold gourd** [金葫芦 *jīn hú lu*],
Which the **gold angle** [金角 *jīn jué*] governs,
Why did it instead manifest as the **silver angle** [银角]?

The treasure of the **ram-fat jade purity bottle** [玉净瓶 *yù jìng píng*],
Which the **silver angle** governs,
Why did it instead manifest as the **gold angle**?

The **gold** enveloping the **silver**—
True **masculine** [雄 *xióng*] transforming into false **feminine** [雌 *cí*],
A reversal in **elixir cultivation** [结丹 *jié dān*];

The **jade** enveloping the **gold**—
False **feminine** transforming into true **masculine**,
A reversal in **transcendence and rebirth** [脱胎 *tuō tāi*].

Alas!
The **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机] is nearly fully revealed.

The **Lotus Flower Cave** on **Flat-Top Mountain** [平顶山莲花洞]—
I once read Master Matteo Ricci’s *Explanation of the Form of Heaven and Earth* [《天地形说》]: Heaven’s body is a vast circle, and Earth dwells fixed at its center. Above, below, and on all four sides are human figures, their soles facing each other in perfect alignment.

For the **qi** of Heaven is clear and ascends, while the essence of Earth is turbid and descends. All around are Heaven’s dominions, so Earth must naturally rest at the core. The very center of Heaven becomes the very lowest point of Earth—thus all figures stand upright, balanced within.

This elucidates the profound truth of the **Dao/Way** of **Emperor Yao**, **Shun**, and **Xi He** [羲和] onward, a revelation truly surpassing all ages!

Calendrical calculations originate from Earth’s heart, yet through them the **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机] remains unexhausted—all this stems from the **soul’s luminous insight** [心之灵明神悟], does it not? Is this not the **soul’s embrace of Heaven and Earth** beyond measure?

Humans indeed possess the **gold gourd** that contains Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**—
The **monkey-heart** [心猿] subdues all entanglements,
Splitting open false paths to reveal the **bright moon** [月明].
**Master Treu-One** [悟一子] said: *The Journey to the West* expounds the **unspoken truths** of the *Yellow River* and *Lo River* [《河》、《洛》], clarifying the **marvelous Dao/Way of inverted yin-yang** [阴阳颠倒之妙道], and pointing to the **true path of cultivation** for all ages.

The earlier text concealed its meaning in veiled metaphors, leaving none unexpressed. Now I reveal the **essential core** of past **immortals and sages** [仙圣], taking the *Awakening to True Reality* [《悟真篇》] as proof, to transmit the **gold elixir’s** [金丹] true essence. This is no mere **Chan School** [禅门] misconception of emptying the **soul’s power** [性] through worship and scriptural pilgrimage!

A **clear mirror** [明镜] stills the waters,
A **radiant moon** [皓月] illuminates the **Chan heart** [禅心].
The ancients and moderns who speak of the **Dao/Way** call this the **sage’s attainment of the Buddha’s path** [圣修佛诣], and here its peak is reached.

Yet the **sage’s** so-called **"Divine"** [神] has depths beyond knowing,
And the **Buddha’s** so-called **"Fruit"** [果] is never truly absent.

「Abandoning the affairs of Laozi, to whom else shall I turn?
The upper section reveals Laozi’s **Five Thieves** [五贼] to subdue the **heart-mind** [心君], which is **Internal Alchemy** [内丹]. In truth, it is the very principle of **External Alchemy** [外丹].

The principle knows no distinction between inner and outer,
Yet the **elixir** [丹] has both inner and outer.
When the inner is established, the outer naturally follows;
When the outer is attained, the inner naturally completes.
Inner and outer, outer and inner—
Inner yet again outer, inner and outer sharing the same source,
Crushed into one seamless whole.

The **work** [功] spans beginning and end,
The beginning founds the end,
The end fulfills the beginning.
Again, the beginning is the beginning and end,
The end is the beginning and end.
Inner and outer, beginning and end—
Reversed and overturned, profound beyond measure,
Unspeakable in words,
The **sage’s** so-called **"Divine"** [神] and the **Buddha’s** so-called **"Fruit"** [果].

At the start of the chapter, the **Master** [师父] spoke fully of Laozi’s affairs,
Though it follows the previous text, it truly sets forth the next intent.
The practitioner says: *“Master, if one only subdues the nature and preserves the Divine, there is no need for further affairs.”*
This is the meaning of **still waters** [止水] and **Chan heart** [禅心].
If one can truly transcend affairs, what need is there for the elixir?
The **Three Treasures** [三藏] hope for long practice to reach the Western Paradise;
The practitioner laughs: *“You haven’t even left the outer gate yet!”*
Saying that by subduing the nature and preserving the Divine, one naturally attains the golden elixir,
This is like hoping for the Western Paradise while yet unstepping through the outer gate—
Hence the saying: *“Do not cling to it; simply let your heart-mind go free and advance forward—
The work will naturally complete itself.”*

“**Freeing the heart-mind**” [放心] means letting go of all attachments,
Yet it is truly the act of gathering the heart-mind without letting it go—
Freeing is the very act of not freeing.

“**Advance forward**” [前进] means that all worldly beings do not advance,
Only by retreating and secretly cultivating does one truly progress—
Retreating is the way to advance.

The work, when truly attained, must first manifest affairs,
Yet when it naturally completes itself, it is not forced.
These words carry deep meaning—
Do not read them as mere encouragement to rush blindly along!

When the **Emperor** [进敕] bestowed the **Precious Forest Monastery** [宝林寺],
The **Elder** [长老] nodded and said: *“Even the **scaled and shelled beings** [鳞甲众生] worship the Buddha,
Yet why would humans not practice the **Dao/Way**?”
He sighed, lamenting that the monastery had only the name of **Precious Forest**,
But lacked its true essence.

The **monk-officials** [僧官] struck the **laymen** [道人] lightly,
As the world does—no cause for surprise.
The practitioner shattered the stone lions,
Transmitting singularly and uniquely,
Startling the crowd and bewildering them.
*“It’s not convenient; you should move them away.”*
This can be seen as **perfect adaptability** [圆便],
Not an invention of Old Monkey—
It follows the method of **stealing the body and rebirth** [夺舍投胎].
*“If you don’t strike them, you’ll carry them in anyway.”*
Once the **stick and shout** [棒喝] has been given,
Though the **monk** [和尚] may turn back,
He remains bound to the **Two Vehicles** [二乘].
“**One bundle of poverty**” [一裹穷]—
A self-made affliction,
Lonely cultivation and rigid sitting,
A bundle of poverty within which no elixir forms,
Dishonoring the **Precious Dharma Jewel Monastery** [法宝珠林].

“**Four-bed platform**” [四张床]—
Master and disciple sharing the same couch,
Three families united,
The **Five Phases** [五行] gathered in harmony,
Only then does the **inexhaustible marvel** [妙赏不尽] appear.

On the **fifteenth day**, **pure yang** [纯阳] prevails,
The **Pre-Heaven Bagua** [先天八卦]—**Qian** [乾] Trigram—**three yang lines** [三阳爻].
The **thirteenth day**, **pure yin** [纯阴] prevails,
The **Kun** [坤] Trigram—**three yin lines** [□卦爻图略].

The **first three days** [初三日],
Kun conceives **one yang** [一阳] at **Geng** [庚] above,
The **Zhen** [震] Trigram—**two yin lines above, one yang line below** [上二阴爻，下一阳爻],
The **fire potency** [火候].
The **eighth day** [初八日],
Kun gives birth to **two yang** [二阳],
The **Dui** [兑] Trigram—**one yin line above, two yang lines below** [上一阴爻，下二阳爻],
The **front crescent** [前弦],
The **medicine and substance** [药物],
The **yang** [阳],
The **first eight** [一八].

The **fifteenth day** [十五日],
**Pure yang** [纯阳],
The **Qian** [乾] Trigram—**three yang lines** [三阳爻].」

On the **sixteenth day**, **Qian** [乾] generates **one yin** at **Shen** [申] above,
The **Xun** [巽] Trigram—**two yang lines above, one yin line below** [上二阳爻，下一阴爻],
The **fire potency** [火候].

On the **twenty-third day**, **Qian** generates **two yin**,
The **Gen** [艮] Trigram—**one yang line above, two yin lines below** [上一阳爻，下二阴爻],
The **rear crescent** [后弦],
The **medicine and substance** [药物],
The **yin** [阴],
The **two eights** [二八].

The *Cántóng* [参同] states:
*"Kàn-Lí* [坎离] are the **two functions of Qian and Kun** [乾坤二用].
Two without fixed positions, circulating through the **six voids** [六虚].
Coming and going are not fixed, above and below have no constancy."
Thus, the Sage adopts these **two eights** [二八],
And from them, **Kàn-Lí** [坎离] arise within—
This is called **"embracing One to contain Three"** [抱一函三].

The **secret verse** [诀] says:
*"Pre-Heaven **One Qi** [先天一气] transforms into **Qian-Kun** [乾坤],
**Gen-Dui** [艮兑] revolve at the **Zhen-Xun** [震巽] gates.
Only the **six voids** [六虚] generate wondrous efficacy,
**Kàn-Lí** [坎离] ebb and flow—**Dao** [道] holds supreme."

This is the **true utterance of the Moon’s brilliance** [月明之真言].
When insight is fully awakened, it is as if **taking the scriptures from the Western Heaven** [西天取经].

The **Sand Monk** further points out:
*"Gold in water"* [水中之金] is the **Five Phases converging** [五行攒簇],
Entirely dependent on **Earth’s correspondence** [全凭土配],
With the **three families united** [三家同会],
Only then does the **Sun’s fullness** [日圆] appear.
*"Water and fire intermingling each have their fate"* [水火相搀各有缘],
Encompassing the **mysteries of *Jìjiè*** [既济], **starting the work** [下手], and **warm nourishment** [温养].

The **Eight Precepts** further clarifies the **subtlety of waxing and waning** [圆缺不全之妙],
Which is the **unfinished secret** [不全之秘要] of *"The Moon emerges on the third day"* [三日月出庚] in *Cántóng*,
And the **true scripture of this very chapter** [本书本回真经].
It also indicates that after the **Moon’s fullness** [月圆],
One must fulfill **three thousand functions** [功满三千] to comply with **Heaven’s edict** [应天诏].

Each disciple expounds upon the **essential nature of cultivation** [本质阐发修炼玄机],
And thus the **entire oral transmission of the Golden Elixir** [金丹始终口诀] is fully revealed.

Yet fearing that one might **recite the *Heart Sutra* in vain** [空念《心经》],
While failing to grasp the **true scripture of Mahayana** [大乘真经],
The **Pilgrim**—through the fault of reciting incorrectly—
Fails to awaken to the **true scripture’s essence** [真经未取晓悟],
This is called **"splitting the side door to see the Moon’s intent"** [劈傍门而见月明意].

*"When the Moon reaches the Heavenly Heart,
The Phoenix comes to the water’s surface,
Such pure delight—
Few truly know its worth."*

The poet who composed this—
Did he understand?

**Thirty-seventh installment**
*The Ghost King Visits Tang Sanzang at Night*
*The Monkey King Transforms as a Child to Lead Away the Infant*

**Treasure One** [悟一子] says:
*"Above, the Moon’s body aligns with Pre-Heaven,
Yet the **wondrous efficacy of Kàn-Lí** [坎离之妙用] remains unseen.
From here onward, it clarifies how **evil masters fail to grasp the Moon’s intent** [月明的旨],
Misidentifying **heart and kidney as Kàn-Lí** [心肾为坎离],
Sealing the **tail-end orifice** [尾闾之穴] in vain,
Taking another’s child as their own,
Thus allowing **evil to occupy *Lí’s* position** [邪乘离位],
While the **true essence falls into *Kàn’s* domain** [真陷坎宫]."

The **case of the Wūjī Kingdom** [乌鸡国一案因果] is recounted to illustrate:
The **mother and child reuniting** [阿母婴儿，母子会合重逢]
Is the **true path of filling *Kàn* with *Lí*** [取坎填离],
The **Golden Elixir entering the mouth** [金丹入口],
The **correct method of reviving the dead** [起死回生之正道].

It must be clarified:
The **main theme—*"The Ghost King Visits the Three Sages"** [鬼谒三藏]—
Reveals that the **cause of falling into error** [失陷之由]
Lies in **mistaking the complete truth** [误认全真];
*"The Spirit Leads Away the Infant"* [神引婴儿]—
Shows that the **method of saving the whole** [救全之法]
Depends on **restoring faith between mother and child** [取信子母].

The **Ghost King** declares:
*"My home lies in the true west,
Known as the **Wūjī Kingdom** [乌鸡国]."*

The **three-legged crow, the black bird of day** [金鸡三足乌],
Is the **yin within the sun’s zenith** [日中之阴],
The **Heart Sovereign** [心君] itself.
When the **Sovereign’s fire rages unchecked** [君火亢炎],
Only **water can temper it** [非水不济].
The **complete truth arrives from the south** [南来全真],
Praying for rain to nourish the land,
And after long drought, rain falls—
**Water and Fire in Harmony** [水火既济],
Illustrating **Qian-Kun’s mutual response** [乾坤交感],
Where **Qian transforms into Kàn** [乾变为坎],
And **Kun transforms into Lí** [坤变为离].

Within **Lí**, the **void yin** [虚阴]—
**one yang line above and below, one yin line in the center** [上下各一阳爻，中一阴爻]—
Must be filled by the **true yang of Kàn** [坎中之真阳],
Only then is the **complete Qian essence** [乾体之真] restored.

If one **mistakes the false forms of the body’s heart and kidney** [一身心肾之假象],
And **clings to internal water-fire exchange as truth** [执水火内交为真],
This is **erroneously grasping the meaning of *"acquiring a companion in the southwest"** [西南得朋之义].

It is like the **true-west king** [正西国王],
Who **pledges brotherhood with the complete truth from Zhōunán Mountain** [结拜锺南山祈雨之全真],
Sharing bed and board,
**Seizing the true as false** [假夺其真],
While the **true is lost** [真者反陷].

**Kàn** [坎] is, in Pre-Heaven, the **true west** [本正西];
**Lí** [离] is, in Pre-Heaven, the **true east** [本正东].
The **true spirit of Lí** [离中真灵] resides in the west,
Thus the **true master of Kàn** [坎中之真主]
Is also the **true master of Lí** [离中之真主]—
They must not be **divided** [不得而二视之].

**Kàn** symbolizes a **well** [井].
The **Kàn Hexagram** [坎卦]—
**one yin line above and below, one yang line in the center** [上下各一阴爻，中一阳爻]—
Its **upper and lower lines** [上下二爻] represent the **eight angles of the four directions** [八角四方],
Clear as **jade-like glass** [透如琉璃],
Hence it is said:
*"Eight-cornered glass well"* [八角琉璃井边].
*"Suddenly, ten thousand rays of golden light"* [忽起万道金光]—
This is the **true gold within Kàn** [坎中之一真金].
One can generate ten thousand—
Hence the **ten thousand rays** [有万道].
*"Pushed into the well’s depths,
Covering the well’s mouth,
Transplanting a banana tree above,
Transformed into my likeness,
Seizing the realm and territory."*

This allegorizes those who **mistakenly identify heart and kidney as Kàn-Lí** [谬认心肾为坎离],
**Sealing the tail-end orifice in vain** [空闭尾闾之穴],
While **inverting the true essence** [逆陷其真];
**Usurping the Sovereign’s *Tài* [泰]**
And **stealing its false pretenses** [窃行其假].

「When they speak of *"the City Deity"* [都城隍], *"the Dragon King of the Sea"* [海龙王], *"the Judge of the Eastern Prison"* [东狱阎君], *"the wine gathering"* [会酒], *"kinsmen and friends"* [亲友], *"brothers"* [弟兄], all these phrases depict their alignment with the **yin spirits** [阴神], sharing **qi** [气] in harmony, making clear that all four great elements [四大] within their being belong to **yin** [阴].

This is the discourse of the **Ghost King** [鬼王] paying homage and distinguishing between **evil and righteous** [邪正]. It reveals the **Prince of the Original Palace** [本宫太子], who is the **true yang’s direct lineage** [真阳之嫡脉], the **root of the savior** [救主之根裔]. Yet, he must seek guidance from the place where he was born from his mother [伊母生身之处], tracing the clues to fulfill his mission. If the mother and child are severed [母子隔绝], the child cannot fully express filial devotion or sincere communication [尽孝通诚], nor repay the mother’s kindness nor rescue the father from his predicament [报母恩而拯父难]. This illustrates the loss of **yin-yang’s primal order** [阴阳失其宗位], for how could one’s **true nature** [天性] remain uncorrupted?

*"Leaving behind a white jade* [白玉珪]*"—*
The **bi** [珪] symbolizes **sincerity** [信], and two **earthly elements** [二土] complement each other, signifying the **harmonious union of husband and wife** [夫妻合意同心], not mere outward pretense [外假模样] or inner emptiness [内无实用] that could achieve this. Hence it is said:
*"I shall entrust a dream to the Original Palace,
Instructing them that mother and child should unite in harmony,
So that you, master and disciple, may align in sincerity."*

This entire ghostly tale [鬼话] is but the **divine revelation** [天机].
When **Tripitaka** [三藏] stumbled and awoke in shock [忽绊一跌惊醒], he had just realized the truth within the dream [梦中方觉].
The **Traveler** [行者] declared:
*"Master, dreams arise from thoughts.
A heart filled with dreams, like old disciple’s single true thought,
Is solely to behold the Buddha—
No dream shall ever reach me."*

He spoke of dreams as **illusions of the unenlightened** [蒙昧不真], for the **true person** [真人] knows no dreams. Yet **Tripitaka** is a true person—how then does he dream?

In ancient times, **Xinxie** [心斋] visited **Lord Yangming** [阳明公], and sat as a guest. When asked:
*"If the true person knows no dreams, why did Confucius dream of Master Zhou?"*
**Lord Yangming** replied:
*"This is the very essence of a true dream."* [梦真]
Xinxie heard this in astonishment [愕然], then knelt and bowed, facing north [逐下拜，执北面礼].

The dreams **Tripitaka** experienced came from the **lunar realm** [论月中]. *"Ghost"* [鬼] and *"cloud"* [云] are but the **soul of the moon** [月魂]. This is the **true essence of the lunar dream** [梦月中之真], not a false one. Hence, the Traveler saw within the moonlight a **white jade bi** [白玉珪] indeed, and said:
*"This matter is true."*

Yet many doubt this, unwilling to act decisively. The Traveler took full responsibility, saying:
*"All lies with old disciple.
Just follow my lead, and it shall be done."*

This is the **Buddha’s promise** [佛祖所云]—*"I now guarantee your success,
And this extraordinary affair shall be fulfilled."* [我今为汝保任，成此希有之事]

The brilliance of decisive action lies in **first binding the infant** [先结婴儿].
Why is binding the infant not beyond the **Kàn-Lí* [坎离] *fulfilled* [既济] *Dao/Way* [道]?
He transformed the **red lacquered box** [红金漆匣], placing the **bi** [白玉珪] within—
Two **earthly elements** [二土] in harmony,
This is to summon the infant to witness the **secret teachings** [秘法].

Marvelous indeed!
*"The Great Sage transformed into a two-inch-long novice monk,
Hiding within the box"*—
A **strange transformation** [奇变] into its **complement** [偶], a **great into small** [大变小],
The **primordial and postnatal** [先天后天] have no fixed form—
With or without substance, they are ever-shifting in appearance [无定体，有质无质无常形].
*"This treasure within the box
Can foresee the past and future of one thousand five hundred years."* [能知一千五百年过去未来之事]
Is it not the **refined essence of the three-five* [三五] *cycle* [之精灵] *?* [耶]」

「The name **"Establish the Emperor’s Treasure"** [立帝货] is given,
Capable of founding the great principle of the world,
Yet causing the Emperor to emerge from **Zhèn** [震].
It transmutes the **treasure** [宝贝] into a **true person** [真人]—
Not the **I, Zhou, Huò, or Gé** [伊、周、霍、葛] of old!

The **Great Sage** [大圣] transformed into a **white hare** [白兔儿],
As the **moon’s spirit** [月魂], the **refined essence of true yang within yin** [阴中真阳之精].
Without this essence, one could not **bind the infant** [结婴].
There are **unfathomable yin-yang transformations** [阴阳不测],
Marvels of **divine transcendence and alchemical change** [出神入化之妙],
Thus the **Crown Prince** [太子] shot an arrow at the white hare,
And the **Great Sage** [大圣] dove into the **red box** [红匣].

When **yin moves**, it becomes **yang**;
When **yang stirs**, it turns to **yin**—
This is what is meant by **divine transformation** [神化].

The **Tripitaka Master** [三藏] spoke of **seeking scriptures in the Eastern Lands and offering treasures** [东土求经进宝],
The Crown Prince replied: *"The Eastern Lands are indeed exhausted beyond measure!"* [东土其穷无比。]
Why so? Though **Golden Master** [金公] was born in the East,
He was truly **a parasitic guest of the West** [实寄生于西].
The West is rich, the East is poor—
This is his natural state.
One must **clearly discern** [认得],
To summon him without letting him **drift away to other lands** [流落他乡],
Only then can **mother and child reunite** [母子相见],
And the **child repay the father’s kindness** [子报父恩].

Thus the **Tripitaka Master** [唐僧] said:
*"You have not avenged your father’s wrongs—
In vain you claim to be human!"* [你的父冤未报枉为人！]

The **Disciple** [行者] leapt from the box,
From a **three-foot-tall child** [三尺之童] to full growth,
All in an instant.
Past, present, and future,
Ancient and modern—
All beings, all things are thus.
By understanding the **principle** [理], one knows them all—
Why bother with endless calculations?

But if one can **recognize** [识得] the **lonely one** [称孤者] in the present,
Then **true insight** [真知] into the **ten thousand ages** [千万年] will be **burningly clear** [灼见],
And **fully comprehended without remainder** [已了彻无遗矣].

For the **human form** [人身] arises from the **interaction of Heaven and Earth** [乾坤交感],
Yet the **true father of one’s birth** [生身之真父] has already **fallen into the abyss** [失陷于坎].
The present body is but a **pure yin phantasm** [纯阴之假体].
All mistake it for reality—
They are all in a **dream** [梦中].
The Disciple could not help but **speak plainly and directly** [正色直指]:
*"The one who departed as the wind spirit—
That is your **true father of birth** [生身之老父];
The one now seated—
That is the **fully authentic** [全真] one who **prays for rain** [祈雨]."*

How **sharp and decisive** [斩绝明快]!
Yet alas—
The **bewildered** [迷人] do not believe,
Instead, they **mistake the one presenting the white jade** [白玉珪] *as*
The **deceiver of my treasure** [骗我宝贝之人]!

Beyond the **name** [名], there is another **name** [名];
Beyond the **body** [身], there is another **body** [身].
*"The white hare pierced by the arrow—
That is **Old Monkey** [老孙]."
*
If one recognizes the **white jade rabbit** [白玉珪] and believes in it without doubt,
Then one may **recite** [念] the **enactment of filial gratitude** [养育恩] and **avenge the wrongs done to one’s parents** [替亲报仇].

The **Immortal Master** [仙师] in this passage
Reveals the **Dao/Way’s profound mysteries** [道妙] line by line from the **true parents of one’s birth** [生身父母],
Hence the saying:
*"Ask your **country’s mother, the queen** [国母娘娘] a single word—
See how their **husband-wife affection** [夫妻恩爱] fares!
Just this,
And you shall know the **true from the false** [真假].*
*
This is **whispered counsel** [悄语], **gentle admonition** [低言],
A **secret safeguard of one’s life** [密保性命之事],
Truly **urgent and earnest** [叮咛切嘱]!

**Chapter Thirty-Eight** [第三十八回]
*"The Infant Disciple Questions the Mother, Discerning Right from Wrong"* [婴儿问母知邪正]
*"Gold and Wood Merge with the Mystic, Revealing False from True"* [金木参玄见假真]

**Master Ru Yi** [悟一子] said:
*"The opening verse of this chapter reads:
‘When you meet me, speak only of the **cause of birth** [受生因],
And you will be one who has **attained the assembly of the Thus-Come One** [如来会上人].’
*
It states that if one knows the **source of birth’s cause** [受生因] from whence it comes,
Then one knows the **method of immortality** [不死之方] is also **constructed** [造] therefrom,
Is it not **transcendent and supremely awakened** [超然大觉]?
One who has **attained the assembly of the Thus-Come One** [如来会上人]!

**Confucius** [宣圣] said:
*"How can one know **death** [死] if one does not know **birth** [生]?
Only by knowing **birth** [生] does one then know **death** [死]."*

**Han Yang True Person** [汉阳真人] said:
*"One must take the **corpse** [死尸] as the **living body** [生尸],
Do not **cling to the label of ‘birth’** [生门] and **deny the label of ‘death’** [死门]."*

**Master Cheng** [程子] said:
*"If one can **trace the origins** [原始],
And **understand the principles of birth** [知得生理],
Then one can **grasp the end** [要终],
And **know the principles of death** [知得死理].*
*
All speak of this same **meaning** [义].

The mind, when made pure and still,
Sees the Buddha in the dust of the world—
Ten directions gaze upon the descending **Mighty One**.

This is the **Way** of keeping the heart clean while the body remains in the world;
The Buddha is vast within the dust, not confined to the Western Paradise.

The body, undivided in self and other, reveals the **mysterious principle**—
This **Mighty One** descends from the void, untouched by names and forms.

As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states:
*"Bodhisattvas belong to sentient beings;
Without sentient beings, all bodhisattvas would never attain supreme awakening."*
This is the meaning of the Buddha in the dust, seen by all ten directions.

*"To know the true master of today,
One must inquire of the mother who bore you in years past."*
This speaks of cultivating the **elixir** today, yet to grasp its true mystery,
One must delve into the origin of the mother who gave birth to you,
Only then will the truth be clearly understood.

As the *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"Urge you to seek the source of your birth-body,
Returning to the origin is the **Pharmaceutical King**."*

*"There is another worldly realm unseen by the world,
Each step a new beginning, each stride anew."*
This **teaching**, transmitted outside scripture, is rarely known by the world.
If one knows it and walks this path,
Each step blooms with fresh flowers—
Lotus after lotus unfolds.

As **Zhongyang True Person** said:
*"If you wish to leave secrets in the world,
Few are the true listeners."*

And the **Dan Jing** states:
*"One grain advanced, one grain refined—
Golden lotuses bloom, yet none recognize them."*

The verses here use symbols to reveal meaning—
What matters is transcending symbols to grasp the **meaning**,
And forgetting words to hold the **meaning**.

The tale of the **Princess**’ dream:
*"Remembering half, forgetting half,"*
For husband and wife reuniting are half true, half false—
How much more so in the realm of dream-death?

The forgotten half conceals a hidden meaning,
Only revealed later through the **Pilgrim’s** and **Eight Rules’** exploration of **metal and wood** mysteries,
Where truth and falsehood are discerned.

The **Prince** asks:
*"Mother, how deep was the love between husband and wife in the palace?"*
The **Princess** replies:
*"This matter remains unclear even in the underworld."*

*"Speaking of cold and warmth so starkly distinct,
With emotional ties severed—
One may perceive that true love is the **orthodox (正)**,
While separation is the **heterodox (邪)**.

This is entirely an empty illusion of **husband and wife**,
Yet falsely clings to lineage as a son—
**Suppressing the natural flow of Dao (天机)**,
**Defying the true nature of existence (真性)**—
What is more **heterodox** than this?

If one wishes to **correct the orthodox** and **remove the heterodox**,
They must first make **husband and wife, mother and child** believe in unity—
Only then can the **previous life** be saved,
Preventing its **degeneration and obscurity (沉沦埋没)**.

The **Princess** recognizes **White Jade Tablet (白玉珪)**,
**Unites it with the night’s dream (合诸夜梦)**,
And entrusts her son to **urgently invite the Holy Monk (圣僧)**,
To **discern the orthodox and heterodox (辨明邪正)**,
And repay his **filial virtue (父恩)**.

**Combining one tablet and two soils (总一圭二土)**,
**Uniting meaning and heart (会意联心)**,
From **death**, seeking **life (从死中求活)**—
Within **calamity**, **virtue emerges (害里生恩)**.

As in the *Awakening to Truth Chapter (《悟真篇》)*:
*"If one meets the killing intent and clarifies its reversals (若会杀机明反覆),
Only then does one know that within calamity, virtue arises (始知害里却生恩)."*

But—
*"To seek the Heavenly treasure (欲求天上宝),
One must use worldly wealth (须用世间财)."*

One must first **gather the Dao’s wealth (聚法财)**,
To **assist the practice of the Way (助道用)**.

**Sun Wukong (行者)** gathers a **wild wind of beasts (聚兽阴风)**,
And the **beasts of boundless measure (野兽)** respond in chorus,
With **great blessings (洪福)**,
Singing triumphantly as they return to the city—
This is the meaning.

Yet, those who practice this are as **numerous as cow’s hair (如牛毛)**,
While those who succeed are as **rare as rabbit’s horns (如兔角)**,
All because **truth and falsehood cannot be clearly discerned (真假未能确见)**.

The **discrimination between truth and falsehood (真假之辨)** lies in the distinction between **solitary cultivation (孤修)** and **mutual aid in practice (共济)**:
**Solitary cultivation** is **false** and difficult to fulfill,
While **mutual aid** is **true** and easily achieved.

If one does not **delve deeply with utmost care (精心穷究)**,
Nor **penetrate the profound mysteries (参透玄机)**,
Then they will **mistake the false for true**,
Or **mistake the true for false**—
**Erroneously acting**, they will never see the **true treasure (真宝)**,
How then can they **revive the dead and return to life (起死回生)**,
Or **remove the heterodox and restore the orthodox (除邪返正)**?

Thus, **Sun Wukong (行者)** has a matter in mind,
And **cannot sleep (睡不着)**—
After **consulting with his master (与师父计较)** and devising a plan,
He **delves into profound mysteries (深研几)**,
Revealing the **secret teachings of master and disciple (师徒传道之密旨)**.

**Sun Wukong** arrives at **Hui Gui’s (八戒) bedside** and calls for the **precious item (宝贝)**,
Saying, *"Let’s go steal it together."*
**Hui Gui** replies, *"I’ll go if it’s thievery."*
**Sun Wukong** says, *"Once we obtain the treasure,
I’ll buy it immediately."*
**Hui Gui** says, *"Then give the treasure to you."*
Both are **overjoyed (满心欢喜)**,
And on **clouds of boundless joy (纵祥云)**,
They **directly head to the banyan tree’s base and the well’s edge (径到芭蕉树下井边)**.

This is where **the metal father and wooden mother unite in meaning and heart (金公木母合意同心)**,
**Wood fully merges with metal (全木交并)**,
**Husband leads, wife follows (夫唱妇随)**,
**Plundering the Dao’s profound mysteries (窃天地之玄机)**,
And **stealing the vital breath of life from the killing intent (盗杀中之生气)**.

Those who **cultivate the elixir (修丹志士)**,
If they can **penetrate this profound truth (能于此处参透真妙)**,
Will have **the true treasure to act upon (真宝下手处)**—
As said in *"In the underworld’s gathering, none recognize it,
Only the banyan tree offers late-night contemplation (阎阳会上无人识，只与芭蕉作晚参)."*

**Hui Gui** descends into the well,
And suddenly sees the **Crystal Palace (水晶宫)**,
Asking the **Dragon King (龙王)** for the **precious item (宝贝)**—
This is the **symbol of filling the abyss (坎填离)**.

The **Dragon King** leads **Hui Gui** to the **Black Rooster King’s corpse (乌鸡王尸)**,
Pointing it out as the **precious item (宝贝)**,
And saying, *"**Sun Wukong** has the intention of **reviving the dead and returning life (起死回生)**,
Rely on you—**whatever treasure he seeks, he will obtain (要甚么宝贝都有)**."*

This **illustrates the elixir’s return and the reversal of yin and yang (寓丹道返还之妙，阴阳颠倒之用)**.
If one can **transform the killing intent into life-giving breath (转生杀之机)**,
And **practice it in reverse (逆而修之)**,
Then **calamity turns to fortune (灾中变福)**,
And **within harm, virtue arises (害里生恩)**—
As said: *"**The Five Phases (五行)** in their natural order are **hellish fire pits (法界火坑)**;
**Reversed practice (正行颠倒)** yields **seven treasures of the earth (大地七宝)**."*

**Hui Gui** **touches the corpse with one hand (一把摸着)**,
Yet **refuses to carry it out (不肯驼出)**.
**Sun Wukong** says, *"That is the **precious item (宝贝)**—
Why not carry it up?"*

**Hui Gui** **discerns the single stroke in the abyss (坎中之一画)** as **the essence of death (死质)** and not the **precious item (宝贝)**,
While **Sun Wukong** **discerns the true essence within the abyss (坎中之真主)** as **vital breath of life (生气)** and thus the **precious item (宝贝)**—
This is the **profound mystery of metal and wood in harmony (正金木相参之玄妙)**.

**Hui Gui** carries the **corpse back to the Monastery of Precious Treasures (宝林寺)**,
And says, *"My elder brother told me—
He can **revive the dead and return life (救得活)**."*

Was **Sun Wukong** truly **without intent (无意)**,
Yet **mocking him to take revenge (捉弄他报仇)**?

**The Great Sage (大圣)** has the intention of **reviving the dead and returning life**,
And the **Dragon King** had already spoken of it—
It is merely **borrowing Hui Gui’s actions (借八戒)** to **point out that the world truly has such elixirs (指世间实有起死回生之药)**,
Urging them to **seek it urgently (宜急早寻求)**.

If the **dead can be revived (死者尚可生)**,
Why fear that the **living cannot transcend mortality (生者不可仙)**?
This is **implicitly stated (隐然言表)**.

Ah! (吁！)"

The **imperial cap and robes** cannot halt decay—
Emperors and tyrants alike turn to dust.

If one does not refine the **Golden Elixir (金丹)**,
One’s life is but a ghost’s hollow abode.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
*A Single Grain of Elixir Obtained from Heaven*
*Three Years Later, the Old Master Revives in the World*

**Treasured Son** said: *"Zhuangyang True Person declared:*
*'Swallowing a single grain of elixir into the belly,*
*Only then does one know one’s life was originally from Heaven.'*
This speaks of the elixir being obtained from the **Yang world (阳世间)**,*
That life is self-made, not granted by Heaven.*

Yet the outline states *'obtained from Heaven (天上得)'*—
Is this not too distant, raising doubts in people’s minds?

But when it speaks of *'Heaven (天上)'*, it means **Heaven within humanity (人中之天)**,*
Not Heaven above (天上之天).

**Hui Gui** said, *"Master, do not believe him.*
He originally said one need not pass through the **Underworld (阴司)**—
In the **Yang world (阳世间)**, a physician can revive him."*

**The Great Sage** said, *"Let the Old Monkey try it in the Yang world."*
*"I shall now seek the **Venerable Laozi (太上老君)***
To beg for a grain of **Nine-Turn Reincarnation Elixir (九转还魂丹)**—
I shall certainly revive him!"*

For **Laozi’s wondrous Dao** exists within the **Yang world**,
And can be attained by all who seek it earnestly—
It is not in Heaven above, only waiting for those who find it.

**Lu Zu** said:
*"I hear people say they all seek me,*
*Yet they tread the world’s edges—no one truly finds me!"*

The **Immortal’s heart to save the world** surpasses that of mortals seeking salvation.
Yet mortals lack the **virtue and devotion** to receive salvation,
Refusing to **sincerely believe and hold firm in their hearts**,
Rejecting transformation, passing by **face-to-face with the True Ones**—
How can one force them to accept salvation?
All must await death before it is too late.

Speaking of this, one can only weep deeply!

**Hui Gui** guards the corpse and weeps—
*Is this the sorrow of **Bian Que’s lament (卞璞)**?*
*Or the pity of **Chu Fu’s grief (楚覆)**?*
*Or the mourning of **Chu Lin’s despair (锄麟)**?*
*Or the lament of **the collapsing city (崩城)**?*
*Or the wail of **Changsha’s grief (长沙)**?*

*Man’s life not yet ended, yet his heart already lost—*
*Oh, Heaven!*
Within a single cry, **yellow paths and black roads** intertwine,
Encompassing boundless suffering in the world’s salvation!

When the sorrow reaches its peak, those who hear shall surely weep—
How much more shall the **Elder’s heart ache with tears!**

**The Great Sage** arrives at **Li Hentian (离恨天)**, **Duosuo Palace (兜率宫)**.
**Laozi** instructs: *"The boys who guard the elixir,*
*Be cautious—thieves come to steal again!"*

When **The Great Sage** borrows the elixir and refuses to give it,
He turns to leave, but **Laozi** chases after him.
For the **Golden Elixir** is a **stolen treasure of transformation**—
Its presence or absence depends not on **Laozi’s stinginess**.
Fearful of theft, he must give it,
Yet giving it is the same as stealing—
The thief’s cunning is beyond all mortals’ sight or knowledge.

**The Great Sage** calls, *"Sha Monk, fetch water."*
**Hu Po** stirs the mixture in her voice.

He spits out the **Golden Elixir** into the corpse’s belly.
**Tripitaka** says, *"If one gains a human’s breath of life, it will suffice."*
**The Great Sage** exhales a **"huff"** of pure **qi** into the throat—
*"A loud sound—then the king’s **qi gathered, his spirit returned**."*

For the **Returning Elixir** has no form—
Without a breath of pure **qi**, it remains unseen.
*"Qi gathered, spirit returned"*—
This is when **metal returns to its original nature (金来归性初)**,
Only then can it be called **Returning Elixir**,
And the old king returns to his kingdom.

The **Water-Clothed Emperor** emerges from the **Kan Palace (坎宫)**—
Many are astonished, so **The Great Sage** clarifies:
*"This is the **Black Cock King (乌鸡国王)**, your true master!"*
He instructs the king to don **Daoist robes**,
Willing to ascend to the **Western Heaven**—
Yet why does **The Great Sage** then say,
*"You need not go to the Western Heaven—
You shall remain your emperor!"*

For a ruler who attains the **Dao in office** can
Practice the **Way of Yao and Shun (尧舜之道)**,
Transform the world, accumulate **virtue and deeds**,
Passing them to future ages,
Saving countless lost souls eternally—
This surpasses **Wei Fu’s merit and deeds a thousandfold**—
Why seek the **Western Heaven** again?

This passage’s poem reveals what *Awakening to Reality (悟真)* did not,
And transmits what the **scriptures** did not—
Yet readers dismiss it as idle chatter,
Equating **Heaven’s secrets and sacred instructions** with vulgar speech,
For they lack true guidance from a true master.

As the opening line states:
*"In the West, the secret is found—seek the True One."*
If one has not obtained the secret,
Even if a true treasure is before them,
How can they truly perceive it?

Next:
*"Metal and water harmonized—now refine the spirit."*
**Metal (金)** is the **Public (公)**, **Wood (木)** is the **Mother (母)**—
Their union forms the **elixir’s head**—
This is the shared meaning across countless scriptures.

If one has not obtained the secret,
They may mistakenly take *"harmonized"* as **alchemical union with a woman (闺丹御女之术)**,
Falling into heresy—
How then can they attain **Suchness (真如)**?

*"The elixir’s mother bears only confused dreams,"*
Meaning the **Ghost King’s dream**—
Half of it is not truly remembered.

Yet the elixir truly has a **Mother**,
And the Mother truly bears **confusion**—
Yet she conceals this mystery from her.

As it says:
*"The infant forever laments his parasitic body,"*
Meaning the **Quanzhen sect’s usurpation**—
The **Crown Prince** is the **parasite**,
Illustrating that the **Great Dao** has an **infant**—
Yet it is not empty.

Yet the infant truly has no form,
And the infant truly has a **parasitic body**—
This is the elixir’s profound mystery.

As it states:
*"One must seek the original master at the well’s bottom,"*
Meaning **Hui Gui’s descent into the well** and return with the **Ghost King**—
Illustrating **filling the **Kan (坎)** with **Li (离)**.*

Yet the **original master at the well’s bottom** has no form—
And the original master truly has a form—
Only those who seek shall find it.
And only by seeking through others can the elixir be perfected.

As it says:
*"One must also pay homage to Laozi in Heaven,"*
Meaning **The Great Sage’s** borrowing of the **Returning Elixir** from **Laozi**—
This implies that **elixir refinement must follow Laozi’s teachings.**

「Yet the **Laozi** is not in the **Heaven of Heaven (天之天)**, but in the **Heaven of Man (人之天)**.
*"Still one must pay homage"*—
This means bowing in reverence and returning,
Seeking from the **Heavens (天)**, then one may obtain the elixir.

It concludes with:
*"Awakening to the emptiness of form and returning to one’s true nature,*
*Truly the **Buddha** saves those with karmic ties.*
Meaning, after attaining the elixir,
One may perceive the nature and illuminate the mind,
Realizing **form is emptiness**, emptiness is form,
Returning to one’s original nature as void,
Then the **Buddha** may save those with karmic ties—
Seeing the **Buddha** is the **Immortal Sage**, the **Immortal Sage** is the **Buddha**.

Those with a predestined **Immortal Sage** connection,
Who can penetrate this verse,
The **alchemical elixir’s** profound secrets are complete—
Even **shelves of sacred scriptures** are no longer needed.

The **Master and Disciple** summon the **King’s** deposition,
The **Demon King** vanishes at the sight of the sky—
All recognize their **former master**,
For *"the true essence now resides in the Yellow Gold Hall (黄金室),*
*a single spark of wisdom forever departs not"*—
This is so.

The **liberation** comes not from the **Underworld (阴司), the Heavens (天), future lives (来生), or other realms (异世),**
But from one’s own **self (本身)** and the **manifest world (阳世)**.

In the following text, the **Demon King** is defeated—
If he were to **transform his guise** and still appear as the **King’s** form,
Would one not be unable to distinguish him?

Yet how does he change to resemble **San Zang (三藏)**,
So that the **Tight-Fitting Spell (紧箍咒)** can reveal him?

The **Immortal Sage** speaks metaphorically of the **original master’s** true and false nature being fixed,
Yet the **Master’s** transmitted secrets may vary.

If one encounters two **Masters**,
And cannot discern who is true and who is false,
Unable to distinguish and mistakenly takes the wrong one as genuine—
This would harm the true one.

Thus, the **verification** of the **living principle (活儿)** must be precise—
Only then is it the **true secret transmission**;
If one **blusters without verification**, it is false teaching.

**Sun Wukong** leaps higher,
Seeking **elevated insight** and **direct contact** with the **true principle**.

**Manjusri** holds the **Mirror of Demon Illumination (照妖镜)**,
Fixing the **Green Lion’s** demonic form—
*"By the **Buddha’s** decree, to avenge the grudge of the water calamity,"*
Meaning those who have suffered harm all mistakenly recognize their own **karmic sins (孽)** as fabricated.

*"This is a castrated lion—*
*It cannot defile purity."*
This refers to those who practice **solitude in the **Dharma of Emptiness (空门)****.

The **lion** is the **Master**.
The **Green Lion** is the **pretender Master**—
A **false Master** masquerading as the **true Master**,
How demonic! How tragic!

Yet in this world, there are many **castrated lions**—
How I wish **Manjusri Bodhisattva** would swiftly bring the **Mirror of Demon Illumination** to seize and remove them!

The **Mirror of Demon Illumination** is the **discriminative wisdom** that perceives others.

**The Forty-First Chapter: The Infant’s Play Disturbs the Zen Mind**
**The Monkey’s and Horse’s Knives Clash with the Wooden Mother’s Void**

**The Sage’s Disciple** says:
These three verses together reveal that,
After attaining the elixir,
One must fully perceive the nature and illuminate the mind,
Ascend to **highest clarity (上彻)** and descend to **lowest tranquility (下梧)**,
Sweep away the **six desires (六欲)**,
Practice **meditation, insight, and wisdom (禅定慧)**,
Face the wall in **non-action (无为)**,
And approach **transformation into the divine (神化)**.

First, it recounts **Sun Wukong** calling the **Daoist** to don his original attire,
Holding the **white jade staff (白玉珪)**,
Ascending the hall to proclaim himself **sovereign**—
This is the **Great Concealment (大隐)** not hindering residence in the court,
As the **wind stirs the world (风动天下)**,
And blessings extend to all people.

Then he declares:
*"I still act as my own **monk (和尚)**,
And go to cultivate **meritorious deeds (功德)**."*

This means that **laymen who attain the elixir (韦布之士)**,
If **greed, anger, and delusion (贪、嗔、痴)** remain unchecked,
And their **practices and virtues (功行)** are incomplete—
This is **cultivating life, not nature (修命不修性)**,
Also a **stubborn Immortal Sage** stuck in **deluded paths (滞迹)**,
Hard to transcend the **Three Realms (三界)**.

As the **Song of the Divine Elixir (敲爻歌)** states:
*"Only cultivating the **Master’s** nature, not the elixir,*
*The endless kalpas turn in vain—one never enters the **Sage’s** path.*
*Clinging to the **Dharma of Life (命宗)**,*
*Lost in the **Master’s** nature—*
*Like a mirror without reflection,*
*One’s face has no fixed image.*
*Lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth,*
*A foolish man with no mastery,*
*Yet holds wealth like a thief without true ownership."*

The **Immortal Sage** intentionally unleashes the **evil fire (邪火)** of **Hong Haier (红孩儿)** and the **filthy water (孽水)** of **Hei Shui Niao (黑水鼍)**,
To teach one to awaken to **true understanding**.

**Huiyan Sage**’s poem says:
*"There is a thing that precedes Heaven and Earth,*
*Formless, originally still and boundless.*
*It can be the master of all phenomena,*
*Yet does not wither with the four seasons."*

The **Dharma of Life (命)** is the **true nature (性)**.
**Nature** has **good, none evil**,
Yet the **mind** cannot be without **partiality and completeness**—
This is the **post-heavenal qi’s** purity and turbidity.

Thus, to **fulfill nature (尽性)**, nothing surpasses **dying to the mind (死心)**;
**Dying to the mind** means **dying to the mind that harms nature**.
To **die to the mind**, nothing surpasses **forgetting the contrivances (忘机)**;
**Forgetting contrivances** means **forgetting what disturbs the mind**.
To **forget contrivances**, nothing surpasses **nurturing qi (养气)**;
**Nurturing qi** means **nurturing the qi that moves the mind**.

**Hong Haier (红孩儿)** is the **innocent child’s heart**.
The **heart** is the **fire repository (火藏)**,
With **yang quality** and **yin nature**,
Externally bright, internally dark.
When **flame ascends (炎上)**, anger surges to the heavens;
When **first ignited (始燃)**, the **latent contrivance (伏机)** lies within.

*"Gathering fire-qi, it soars straight to the ninth sky,"*
This is **anger**.
*"Naked body, no clothing, dangling from the tree’s tip,"*
This is the **latent contrivance**.
Its **sudden rise and fall, ever-changing and unpredictable**,
Holds the **deceitful mind (昧心)** that plays with **true principle (正)**,
Desiring to **overthrow the enlightened wisdom (明眼)** that guards the **true principle**—
This is the **true contrivance**.

The phrase *"wasting one’s mental efforts"* is the **demon’s** confession.

The three **disciples** each grasp their weapons,
As if ready to strike—
The **Elder** rages at the **monkey’s** demonic tricks,
And in fury **seizes the horse** to scold.

All **portray** the **stimulated mind** in **anger**,
Disturbing the **Zen mind**.

*"Gully of the withered tree,"*
Wood dried, fire **flares**—
Tracing the **mind-demon’s** origin where its power thrives.
*"Red in hundreds of thousands,"*
Fire **intensifies**, color **burns bright**—
Describing the **mind-demon’s** rampant might.

Feigning **suffering from calamity and capture** to seek rescue,
And falsely claiming **lands, kinfolk** to offer **bribes**—
All are **exaggerations** of the **mind-demon’s** ever-shifting **deceitful schemes**.

**Bajie** wields the **staff of precepts (戒刀)** and cuts the **rope** to free the **demon**,
Unable to **perceive the mind** and thus **break precepts** to **free the mind**.

The **Elder** commands the **child** to **ride the horse** and take it away,
Yet **has not subdued nature** and thus **reluctantly allows the horse to follow its nature**.

*"Do not let the two monks carry it,"*
*"I am glad to carry it myself,"*
The **fire-demon** laughs and **recklessly subdues the gold**.

*"Only three catties in weight,"*
*"This frame is so light,"*
The **gold-demon** is **manifest yet secretly harbors fire**,
A **confused yet enlightened** state where **evil and true principle** persist through time.

The ancient poem thus states:
*"When Dao and virtue tower high, the demonic miasma rises high,
For the mind’s essence is inherently still—yet from stillness arises malevolence.
The Mind-Lord walks upright in the Middle Way,
Yet the Wood-Mother, dull and misguided, strays beyond and falls into chaos.

The Thought-Bird speaks not yet harbors amorous cravings,
The Yellow-Crone utters no words yet frets with anxious heat.
When rogue thoughts gain sway, they bring only fleeting joy,
For in the end, they dissolve from the very place where virtue was rooted.*

It speaks of how when the Middle Way is disturbed by agitation,
One cannot remain steadfast—thus stillness breeds malevolence.
The Mind-Lord is inherently upright,
Yet when fire stirs, the Wood-Mother falters—unable to grasp true principle, that is *"straying beyond and falling into chaos."*
Like the pulse of the Yin and Yang, the two chaotic paths,
Not guided by the Middle Way.

When lost, the Thought-Bird no longer obeys the Mind-Lord,
And amorous cravings arise—when cravings stir, the steadfast virtue is disordered,
Bringing upon itself anxious heat.

Only when rogue thoughts are rooted out from the place of virtue
Can one attain true stillness—stillness within movement,
Movement within stillness—like the steadfast virtue itself.
Then rogue thoughts have no power to run rampant.
This poem elucidates the core principle of the outline: *"Monkey-Horse-Staff-Gui-Wood-Mother-Empty."*
It is the true peril of a disordered mind.

When the mind is disordered, unable to remain steadfast,
The Monkey’s and Horse’s gold and water,
The Staff’s and Gui’s two soils,
The Wood-Mother’s wood and fire,
All lose their true nature and become empty—
That is the meaning: *"Where fire arises from wood, disaster will certainly strike."*

*"The Great Sage’s heart brims with resentment,"*
Steadfast virtue disrupted by movement;
*"That demon’s heart ignites with fury, stirring a whirlwind, hurling sand and stone,"*
Movement without steadfast virtue.

The Master’s traces vanish—
The mind is obscured, and nature falls into confusion.

The Pilgrim and Bajie confer, each parting their ways—
The mind is disordered, and the Five Phases become empty.

Sha Wujing says:
*"It has a beginning but no end."*
It means one can cultivate the vital breath (命) but not the nature (性).

Yet those who can truly begin and end are entirely reliant on the Thought-Soil (意土).
When the Thought-Soil is sincere, the Mind-Lord stands upright,
And delusion can be dispelled.
Sha Wujing is the Thought-Soil.
Thus the Pilgrim says:
*"Since the virtuous younger brother has such sincere resolve,
We shall still go in search of that demon,
To rescue the Master."*

The Great Sage’s heart burns with true anguish—
The Thought-Soil is sincere, and the Mind-Lord stands upright.

*"Transforming into three heads and six arms,"*
Three of Heaven’s, six of Earth’s—
Realigning the cosmos, fixing the upper and lower positions—
Steadfast virtue.

*"Strike eastward one path, strike westward another path,
And strike forth a band of impoverished gods."*
Ah!

Ah, wondrous indeed!

For truly, sincere intent must first attain knowledge—
to fail in attaining knowledge while striving for sincerity is folly, not sincerity.
How then could one clarify the heart and perceive the nature?

Thus the virtuous seeker values profound inquiry into subtle changes,
exhausting the divine to fathom transformations,
so as to exhaust their variations.

*"Strip one layer, hang one layer,
Pants without a crotch, trousers without a mouth."*
The utmost exhaustion—
to illuminate exhaustion by probing its essence,
and to exhaust its transformations utterly.

*"Six hundred *jie* drills piercing the mountain,
Encompassing thirty mountain deities,
Thirty earthly deities."*
Speaking of the Earth’s circular expanse,
vast and broad, six hundred *jie* in measure.

This is as the *Parameters of the Mysterious Unity* says:
*"Six-five, the receptive bearing,
Binding the beginning and end,"*
*"Sixty folds gathered on one axle."*
For the Earth thrice generates fire,
capable of piercing upward with fiery heat—
the *Li* hexagram’s symbol of clarity and dissolution.

When it follows Heaven’s bestowal,
it harmonizes its nature and nurtures all things;
When the Earth’s fire is excessive,
it distorts its nature and scorches all living beings.

The deities lament:
*"They grind our heads smooth,
leaving no incense, no paper—
no blood offerings at all.
They demolish our shrines,
strip our robes,
and leave us no peace."*

What harm is this but the rampant fury of fire’s nature?
Like a greedy official’s tyrannical blaze—
cruel and oppressive—
he plunders the people’s sustenance,
strips the earth bare.
Their hearts and their harm are one and the same.

*"Gutted-tree ravine, cloud-cave flames"*—
this describes the scorching inferno,
wooden fire raging, its smoke blinding the sky.

They speak of their parents—
the Bull Demon and the Rakshasa,
originally demonic,
refined in the Fire Mountain’s *sanmei* practice—
a perverse *sanmei*,
the extreme of evil,
not the true, upright *sanmei* of enlightenment.
They are called *"Holy Infant King"*—
infant yet self-sacred,
infant yet self-enthroned,
infant yet self-augmented—
merely ignorance incarnate.

Truly, *"Before refinement, the infant’s demon-fire prevails,"*
urgently requiring *"the Monkey-Heart and Wooden-Mother to uphold it."*
How terrifying, how perilous!

---
**Forty-first Chapter: The Monkey-Heart Defeated by Fire, the Wooden-Mother Captured by the Demon**

A sage of old said:
*"To let emotion return to its nature,
first teach fire to retreat within the heart.
Two forces merge as one essence—
golden elixir everywhere."*

Again he said:
*"To preserve longevity, first restrain desire.
If desire-fire does not falter, the spirit steadies itself.
Wood returns to fire, yet does not turn to ash—
if one restrains desire, life extends."*

For emotion arises from nature,
and wanders beyond virtue or vice—
all driven by fire’s transformations.
Without fire, nothing is born;
without fire, nothing is extinguished.

Thus fire’s power is most wondrous—
for good, it is potent;
for evil, even more so.

Nature is its root;
the heart, its dwelling;
the will, its trigger;
*qi*, its manifestation.
*"Most vast, most rigid,"*
filling heaven and earth,
unassailable.

If one nurtures *qi* rightly,
the heart remains undisturbed,
and nature steadies itself—
harmonizing with the Dao.

Mencius spoke of *"direct nourishment, vast and unharming"*—
this is adjustment, rectitude, and stillness—
the true essence of *sanmei*.

To preserve the heart and nurture nature
is to serve Heaven.
Heaven’s lifespan is unchanging—
this is the foundation of one’s fate.
Gathering virtue brings forth the elixir;
following the natural order receives its rectitude.
The Dao of the Golden Elixir is now fully revealed.

Ah! This Dao was nearly exhausted by Mencius.

The immortal master’s treatise
exposes those who harm the heart by failing to nurture *qi*,
thus fully elucidating Mencius’ chapter on *"nurturing qi."*

Zhuangzi said: *"Calmness nurtures *qi*."
Mencius taught that *"not forgetting, not assisting"* is the proper way—
both emphasize cultivation before disturbance arises.
But once *qi* is aroused and forcibly suppressed,
this is already a step behind.

The opening verse holds the crucial secret of proper nurturing:
*"Forgive all wrongs in an instant,
ignore gain and loss alike.
Conceal or reveal—let fate decide,
eat when hungry, drink when thirsty.
The spirit, still and serene, remains ever quiet;
if deluded, demons will intrude.
The Five Phases invert in the Zen halls—
when wind stirs, cold seizes."*

The meaning is clear—
no need for further explanation.

This is *"clarifying the heart, seeing nature,"*
where all attachments dissolve,
leaving not a thread behind.
Serene and forgetful,
quiet and unassisted—
this is the true nurturing of *qi*.

The final two lines warn:
If one cannot remain serene,
cannot forget or assist,
even in the Zen halls,
encountering scenes will stir the heart—
and this is not true nurturing.

Fire uses smoke as its messenger;
*qi* takes anger as its form.
Thus Mencius used the examples of She and Yi’s *qi*-driven courage
to illustrate its harm;
the immortal master used the Red Boy’s demonic *qi*
to depict its malevolence.

Fire is *qi*;
smoke is anger—
their meaning is one.

*"Five swift chariots"*—
light and easily agitated.
*"Pressing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth"*—
fire governs the Five Phases,
just as the heart governs the Five Organs,
and anger governs the Seven Emotions.
As the verse says:
*"All generation and transformation stem from fire,
fire pervades the boundless sky, bringing life to all."*

*"The demon lost the battle,
then pounded his own nose in defeat,
spouting flames from his mouth,
thick smoke from his nostrils,
and fiery sparks from his eyes."*
All depict his *qi* erupting,
shaking his heart.

Seeing him strike his own nose, bleed,
and declare victory by sealing the door—
this reveals his unchecked arrogance,
his reliance on fearlessness as strength,
exposing his *qi*-driven fury.

Eight Rules exclaimed:
*"This wretch is shameless, unashamed!"*
Again: *"He unleashes such merciless fire!"*
Again: *"No hope!"*
Again: *"No justice—he sets the flames!"*
A true portrayal.

Eight Rules panicked,
abandoning the Pilgrim,
unwilling to engage further—
unable to align with righteousness and the Dao, he faltered.

Sand Monk sought victory through the theory of *"mutual generation and conquest,"*
using Water to subdue Fire—
but this failed in principle,
forcing suppression where harmony was needed—
a forced imposition like Zhi’s.

The Pilgrim sought rain from the Eastern Ocean,
and the Dragon King sprayed water on the flames—
like the Song scholar’s desperate attempt to coax the shoots—
*"Pouring oil on fire,
the more he doused, the fiercer it burned."*

Not only was it useless,
but it *"attacked the heart with fire-qi,
driving the Three Souls from their dwellings."*
Then came:
*"Qi choked his chest, his tongue grew cold,
his spirit scattered, his life abandoned."*
The shoots withered.

Eight Precepts and Sand Monk made the Pilgrim *"sit cross-legged in meditation, practicing the massage-Dhyāna technique."*

*"In a short while, his qi passed through the Three Passes,*
*turned at the Bright Hall,*
*burst open the orifices,*
*and he called out: ‘Master!’"*
Sand Monk replied: *"Brother, you were born my master—*
*even in death, you remain in my words."*

There must be purpose in this,
yet do not expect immediate results—
keep the heart undistracted.

*"Together they sat beneath the pine grove,*
*and in a short time,*
*his spirit settled, his qi harmonized."*
Thinking of *"invoking Guanyin Bodhisattva"*—
this was the gathering of virtue in action,
gradually entering the subtle realm of nurturing the self.

Yet gathering virtue is how one nurtures the qi,
and understanding speech is how one gathers virtue.
Unable to discern speech,
one fails to grasp the truth—
true and false become indistinguishable,
and actions in motion or stillness lose their proper measure,
leaving no path for virtue to gather.

The demon revealed the *Ruyi* skin-bag
and lured Eight Precepts,
*"transforming into a false Guanyin to await him."*

The *Ruyi*—
born from his own mind;
the *"false Guanyin"*—
emanating from his words;
the *"skin-bag"*—
a deceitful utterance.

Words may be deceitful, lustful, perverse, or evasive,
but we focus on deceit,
for it most clearly obscures the mind—
and one example suffices for the rest.

Eight Precepts, unable to distinguish true from false,
*"saw the image and took it for a Buddha,"*
believed the deceitful words,
and was stuffed into the bag—
unable to discern speech, he was deceived,
and though he grasped at virtue, it failed to gather.

The demon said: *"With your eyes wide open, you still don’t recognize me!"*
—revealing his own ignorance of his own deception.

Eight Precepts cursed from within the bag:
*"You’ve schemed every way to trick me into eating—*
*I’ll make sure you suffer the heavenly plague!"*
His words, born of malice, only harmed himself,
for he truly invited ruin upon his own nature.

The Pilgrim endured the pain and entered the demon’s cave,
daring not to confront him directly,
*"and transformed into a ‘melting-gold bundle’ to cast down."*
This transformation’s subtlety
nearly defies recognition.

For the mind is a fire-hiding place—
one must not let it flare upward.
The character *bao* (包) carries the radical of *bao* (包),
and though enclosure may seem profound,
it ultimately harbors two kinds of discomfort.
To cast down the bundle,
to abandon enclosure entirely—
what liberation!

Thus, he transformed into a bundle and cast it down,
to extinguish the flame.

*"Melting-gold"*—
the image of fire refining gold.
Ancient seal script for the character *xin* (心) was simply an inverted *"fire"* (火),
not enclosed but made to submit downward—
just as the Pilgrim *"cast down the bundle,"*
and as before, the meaning of *"letting go of the heart."*

Again, he transformed into a fly to scout ahead,
not first rescuing Eight Precepts
but following the Six Generals—
this was cautious, silent observation,
discerning the root without confrontation,
temporarily easing tensions to restrain its outbreak.

This action already subtly penetrated the *sanmei* [三昧].

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Great Sage Reverently Pays Homage to the Southern Sea, Guanyin Compassionately Binds Hong Hai**

The Sage said: *"Nature is the decree of Heaven.*
*Let its scope be as vast as Heaven’s, its duration as enduring as Heaven’s,*
*let it arise from me, not from Heaven—*
*yet it does not command one to indulge in fine food or sensual pleasures.*
*Thus, it is undivided Heavenly Principle, without vice.*

*When it manifests, it is also undivided Heavenly Principle, fully virtuous—*
*this is called *following Nature*.*

*If one follows Nature, it is *holding the Mean*, it is *True Suchness*,*
*it is *Inner Elixir*, Sagehood, Immortality, and Buddhahood.*

*But if there is even a hair’s breadth of partiality or perversity,*
*it is no longer undivided Heavenly Principle.*

*All partiality and perversity are evil, are demonic forces,*
*are the private desires of the human heart obscuring truth.*

*The undivided Heavenly Principle is nothing but *Ren*—*
*it is *compassionate virtue*."*

*To preserve the undivided Heavenly Principle, one must cultivate *qi*;
*to cultivate *qi*, one must still the heart;
*to still the heart, one must quiesce the mind;
*to quiesce the mind, one must gather righteousness;
*to gather righteousness, one must know speech;
*to know speech, one must remove obstructions;
*to remove obstructions, one must attain knowledge.*

*This is called *refinement*."*

*Within this chapter, the Pilgrim transforms into King Yumao,*
*turning the Dao into demonic forces—*
*this is not following Nature.*

*The father and son’s reverent meeting, courteous and proper,*
*is Nature, yet he acts within it.*

*The boy calls himself *“Ignorant Son,”*—*
*ignorance is obscuration, lacking clarity,*
*unable to attain knowledge—*
*this is Nature, yet truth cannot be seen through it.*

*Of all Heaven’s natures, none surpasses that of father and son.*
*The father deceives his son, mistaking a false son for the true one;*
*the son, in his ignorance, mistakes a false father for the true one.*

*The lesser demons all knelt and said:*
*“Great King, you cannot even recognize your own father!”*
*Words that lose the true for the false,*
*and obscure the Heaven-given nature of one’s birth.*

*To seek longevity while obscuring one’s Heavenly nature*
*is like asking a false father for one’s birth chart,*
*bothering Zhang Daoling to calculate the Five Stars of Ziwei*
*in hopes of matching Heaven’s immortal lifespan—*
*how could this succeed?*

*To defy Heaven’s decree and violate filial piety,*
*how is it different from striking one’s father and rebelling against one’s son?*
*When conscience awakens, how could one not blush with shame?*

*There are also those who falsely claim Daoist learning and misrecognize Heavenly nature,*
*just as the Pilgrim falsely impersonates the demon king,*
*pretending to hunt morality like a royal hunt.*

*“Sitting in the central seat of the south”—*
*occupying it without doubt.*

*What they calculate is the distant concern of securing one’s livelihood and old age;*
*what they boast of are their boundless transformations;*
*what they gather are the clever appearances of mimicking others;*
*what they uphold is the false austerity of thunder-fasts;*
*what they recognize are the celestial omens of the *Liuzhi* [六爻].*

This is a heartless, depraved act of evil, yet they know not they are devouring men, these demons of life’s corruption!
The Pilgrim’s transformation—from true to false, then back again—is but a display of his cunning, his laughter a mockery of the unknowing.

When he changes, let the unseeing open their blinded eyes;
when he laughs, let the ignorant shrink their probing heads—
for wisdom lies in exposing folly at its root,
not in clashing banners on the battlefield.
It is like the water-worker who strives against the current,
or the arsonist who seizes the wind.

*"No need to worry—I’ll fetch the Bodhisattva myself."*
*"Straight to the Southern Sea, to the cliffs of Lankā,*
*and prostrate myself in homage!"*

How clear the vision, how direct the path!

The Bodhisattva spoke in fury:
*"That wretch dares mimic my form!"*
With a sweep of his gem-studded alms-bowl,
he hurled it into the sea’s depths.

The Pilgrim scoffed:
*"This Bodhisattva’s fire has not yet cooled."*

Before he could finish, the waves churned—
a tortoise surfaced, bearing the bowl ashore,
and knelt in twenty-four obeisances.

*"Ah, the Keeper of the Bowl!"* said the Pilgrim.

The Bodhisattva commanded:
*"Pilgrim, take the bowl!"*
Not a drop could be moved.

*"You do not know,"* said the Bodhisattva,
*"that it was always empty—
but cast into the sea,
it now holds all its waters within.
What strength could you have to lift the ocean?
Thus, you cannot take it."*

Alas!

「Ah! How wondrous this is!

The commentator says: *"The tortoise bearing the bowl,*
*along with the later episodes of the lotus petals crossing the sea,*
*the Dragon Princess plucking hairs—*
*all these exchanges, leisurely unfolded,*
*seem unrelated to the main text,*
*merely serving as a foil to the Red Boy."*

*"Like the painter’s words:*
*'‘Fine grasses and fallen flowers make a brocade land,’*
*these fallen flowers are but embellishments*
*to adorn the fine grasses,*
*thus completing the brocade."*

*Yet this passage reveals the Immortal Master’s*
*application of profound truth,*
*crafting a marvelous form—*
*truly the core of the main text.*

*His imaginings and strokes*
*possess a divine, ghostly artistry,*
*beyond mortal reach.*
*Among a hundred chapters,*
*this stands as peerless masterwork!*

*Laozi teaches:*
*"Through kindness, one attains courage;
Through frugality, one attains breadth;
By not daring to lead the world,*
*one achieves enduring greatness."*

*In ancient times,*
*the Duke of Zhou and King Wu,*
*in their wrath, settled the land;*
*Confucius, in his wrath,*
*rectified the four cardinal directions—*
*great courage indeed.*

*Yet only through great kindness*
*could such great courage arise.*
*The demon’s guise as a false Bodhisattva,*
*deceptive yet plausible,*
*confuses truth with falsehood—*
*the foremost trick of evil spirits,*
*most destructive in its harm.*

*The Bodhisattva, in great kindness,*
*thus raged:*
*"That wretch dares mimic my form!"*
*"With a sweep of my gem-studded alms-bowl,*
*I cast it into the sea’s depths!"*
*Clear in vision, resolute in deed—*
*this is “Through kindness, one attains courage.”*

*The *Huainanzi* states:*
*"There is essence yet it is not used,*
*there is spirit yet it is not employed.*
*In harmony with the Great Primordial Purity,*
*one stands within the realm of utmost clarity."*
*This is the Way of frugality.*

*"‘Always an empty bowl,*
*cast into the sea,*
*now it holds all its waters within—*
*you cannot lift it.’"*
*The empty bowl is the epitome of frugality,*
*and only through such frugality*
*does one attain boundless breadth,*
*as in the saying:*
*"‘A sesame seed can contain Mount Sumeru,*
*a hair can swallow the great ocean.’"*
*This is “Through frugality, one attains breadth.”*

*The *Book of Documents* says:*
*"One must have capacity,*
*then virtue grows great;*
*one must endure,*
*then salvation is achieved."*
*This speaks of vast Qi/breath,*
*encompassing all with serene cultivation.*

*Among the myriad creatures,*
*the tortoise is the longest-lived,*
*taken as a symbol of guarding the female*
*and nurturing with wisdom.*
*The sage composed the *I Ching*’s *Yi Hexagram*,*
*its first line modeled on the tortoise,*
*to show how the virtuous one*
*cultivates themselves.*

*"‘Seeing the waves churn,*
*a tortoise emerges,*
*bearing the alms-bowl to the cliffs,’*
*it carries its burden with ease,*
*lifting what others cannot—*
*is this not*
*'By not daring to lead the world,*
*one achieves enduring greatness’?"*

*This contrasts sharply*
*with the Red Boy’s reckless triumph,*
*void of cultivation.*

*The Pilgrim bowed in reverence:*
*"This disciple does not know."*
*I too bowed in reverence:*
*"This disciple does not know."*
*Will those who read this book in ages to come,*
*and grasp my meaning,*
*also bow and say*
*"‘This disciple does not know’?"*

*"The Bodhisattva’s right hand lifts the bowl,*
*resting it on his left palm—*
*flowing effortlessly,*
*a display of mastery,*
*the third *Dhyāna* of perfect stillness."*

*Yet how does the water arise,*
*if the bowl holds the sea*
*and the tortoise dives beneath?*
*Unknown to the common eye,*
*the bowl’s contents are not mere water,*
*but the very Qi of the ocean—*
*formless, untouched by substance.*
*Thus the Bodhisattva declares:*
*"‘My bowl holds sweet dew,*
*not like the Dragon King’s spray,*
*which can extinguish that demon’s*
*threefold *Dhyāna* flame.’"*

*With the true water of *Dhyāna*,*
*he subdues the false fire of *Dhyāna*—*
*using spirit, not mere form,*
*exemplifying the art of perfect cultivation.*
*What need then for the mind’s wild flames?*

*When the mind is unrestrained,*
*it seeks dominance,*
*burning fiercely like wildfire;*
*when the mind is still and true,*
*it guards the female,*
*nurturing like sweet dew.*

*The wildfire*
*is the demon’s torment,*
*consuming the heart;*
*the sweet dew*
*is the elixir,*
*irrigating the soul.*
*The tortoise is indeed the Red Boy’s*
*tailored antidote.*

*As for the alms-bowl,*
*it cradles true Qi,*
*vast and tranquil,*
*not merely empty and detached—*
*this is the Dao of*
*"non-action yet transformation,*
*stillness yet creation."*

*Should one harbor*
*a hint of grasping or attachment,*
*they could never fathom its depths.*
*Thus the Bodhisattva again*
*illustrates the Dragon Princess’s*
*and the precious bowl’s reluctance to part,*
*showing that such treasures*
*are not easily obtained.*

*It is not the Bodhisattva who is hard to part from,*
*but the Pilgrim’s own*
*indulgence and stinginess*
*that make the Bodhisattva’s gifts difficult.*
*Hence, the tight-skin cauldron’s removal,*
*and the Bodhisattva’s words:*
*"‘You are at ease.’"*
*To let go is not to abandon,*
*but to transcend.*

*The Pilgrim plucking hairs,*
*fearing it might save his life,*
*the Bodhisattva says:*
*"‘Not a hair shall you pluck,*
*for even my treasure, Shàncái,*
*I cannot part with.’"*
*Stinginess thus makes parting hard.*

*Wealth and desire*
*are external temptations,*
*while Shàncái is the true nature’s*
*wondrous manifestation.*
*The Bodhisattva reveals:*
*Shàncái’s reluctance to part,*
*showing how one sees goodness*
*in wealth,*
*divines its use,*
*discerns the difficulty of letting go,*
*and awakens to the act of release itself.*

*This is where the Master*
*blends truth with metaphor,*
*logic with divine inspiration—*
*a realm akin to*
*"the Heavenly Maiden scattering flowers,"*
*not to be read lightly.*

*Emerging from filth yet pure,*
*the lotus stands alone,*
*thus its petals can serve as*
*the universal vessel of compassion,*
*blown by the breath of Dao,*
*dispelling all afflictions,*
*what fear of the boundless sea of suffering?*

*To even the emotions*
*and achieve harmony,*
*one must endure.*
*Thus the *Gāng* blade can form*
*the Bodhisattva’s seat of Dharma,*
*as he sits serene,*
*clouds gathering around,*
*unfazed by even the mightiest trials.*

*The Dragon Princess splits the lotus,*
*ascending to the other shore,*
*while Huì’àn leans on the cosmic *Gāng*’s power,*
*transforming into a lotus platform—*
*both reveal the clarity of true nature.*

*The Bodhisattva overturns the alms-bowl,*
*pours the water like thunder;*
*extends the willow branch,*
*turns the blade into a hook.*
*The reader may think:*
*"‘The water poured to quench the fire,*
*a preemptive strike;*
*the lotus seat to ensnare the blade,*
*a victory without battle—*
*the utmost of goodness.’"*

All have lost their subtlety.

They do not grasp
that overturning the alms-bowl like thunder’s roar
is itself *delusion*—
for it points to their delusion
and lets them awaken on their own.

To awaken with wisdom against delusion
only makes the deluded more so;
to delude with delusion
makes the deluded awaken themselves.
Thus the Dao of skillful guidance
is to let them awaken with goodness,
not to let them delude with goodness.

Sitting on the lotus platform to learn the Bodhisattva’s way,
that is awakening—
for they hear of the path to awakening
and know their own delusion.
To awaken the awakened,
yet the awakened seem deluded,
to delude the awakened
yet the awakened grow ever more awake.
Thus the law of skillful transformation
is to let them awaken fully,
not to let them delude fully.

The alms-bowl tilted writes the character *迷* (delusion),
*come, come, come*—
observe how distant the land is from the surging tides,
where does the little cart still gallop on its old tracks?

The blade’s tip becomes the platform of awakening,
*sit, sit, sit*—
who knows the glory of the hollow is but a trick of the edge?
How could one endure an empty blade swung to nothing?

The Wayfarer rages in anger,
the great compassion of skillful guidance;
the demon rages in anger,
the great awakening of being ensnared in delusion.

Wondrous indeed!
The Bodhisattva asks twice yet gives no answer,
quelling their reckless striving.

The demon strikes with one spear,
piercing the heart and exposing its core—
sitting there,
pointing to that very place—
how could it ever have been truly fixed?

One must know the mind of *non-abiding* (無住) and birth—
*strike, strike, go*—
only when the heart dies
is it truly born anew;
urgently seek to lay all down at once.

*"Three top supports"* (三个顶搭)
clearly mark the three stars of the mind,
supporting heaven and earth as the Three *Talents* (三才).
Do not thrust into the flames of fire.

*"Five binding straps"* (五个箍儿)
embody the five virtues within the body,
gathering the spirit and consolidating the *qi*,
restoring innate virtue—
rejoicing in the golden nest of ease.

*"Called the Child of Wealth"* (善财童子),
human nature is inherently good,
and all talents are good—
merely affirming their goodness.

This is the cultivation of the boundless *Hàorán* *qi* (浩然之氣),
revealing true nature and clarifying the mind,
the wondrous Dao of great compassion and great pity.

Its essence points to no other than *"rightness and stillness"* (正定),
hence the saying:
*"A single word can recognize the sands of the Ganges,*
*boundless and profound is the law’s power."*

**Forty-third Chapter**
*Black River Demon Captures the Monk*
*The Western Dragon Child Snatches the Turtle*
**Awakened One** says:
This passage follows the Black Boy’s ability to stabilize his true nature and perceive the great compassion—
when the true heart is clear, wild impulses dissolve.
The Black Turtle, unable to nurture its true nature, churns waves and follows currents—
when false desires stir, the true nature sways,
demonstrating the harm of letting nature be swayed by the heart’s movements.
The former preserves the heart,
this cultivates the nature.

The Bodhisattva takes away the sea’s waters,
the child returns to its right fruit,
the Wayfarer releases the Three Treasures and Eight Rules,
firmly vowing to journey west.
The fire-nature of self-arising is already subdued,
yet the water-nature of outward dispersion still lingers.
*"Suddenly hearing the sound of water"* stirs the heart again,
unable to keep the mind as still as water.

Thus the Wayfarer raises the *Heart Sutra* (多心經) again to clarify the Six *Thieves* (六贼).
Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—
the Six *Thieves* of Heaven;
color, sound, scent, taste, touch, and *dharma* (法)—
the Six *Thieves* of the World.
If the Six *Thieves* of Heaven are not understood,
the Six *Thieves* of the World will ride in separately;
if the Six *Thieves* of the World are not removed,
the Six *Thieves* of Heaven will steal together.
Mutually harming and robbing,
the vital *qi* is lost along with it—
all from failing to forget the artifices and kill the heart to invite this fate.
Hence the saying:
*"Summoning these six thieves in confusion,*
*how can one reach the Western Paradise to see the Buddha?"*

If one seeks success,
it must be through purifying the heart and nurturing the nature,
not letting the heart hold even a speck of love, desire, greed, anger, or delusion.

The harm of greed and delusion
is no greater than the Black Waters surging like tides,
the little turtle as a demonic force.
*"The Black Water River God’s domain in Hengyang Pass"* (衡阳峪黑水河神府)
refers to the Kidney Palace (肾宫),
where the true spirit resides.
The little turtle, relying on its strength,
seizes and plunders its domain—
that is the unruly *qi* of greed and delusion.
It calls itself *"the foolish nephew"* (愚甥),
clearly a confession of guilt.
The foolish one is he who confuses right and wrong—
compare it with the Black Boy’s *"foolish son"* (愚男),
both reveal their greedy ignorance,
not humility.

The turtle dwells in the Black Waters yet names itself *"pure"* (洁),
like a man harboring filthy thoughts yet unaware of his impurity.
The Dragon King tells the Great Sage:
*"This is my younger sister’s ninth son. Because his father-in-law delayed the rains,
he was sentenced by the Heavenly Tribunals to be beheaded by Wei Zheng,
leaving behind this nephew, who nurtures his nature and cultivates truth in the Black Water River,
unexpectantly committing such evil."*

The ninth son, the youngest son.
The turtle’s purity—its youngest son;
the turtle’s impurity—is it not the second son?
Seeing this, does my earlier note that the Old Dragon is Li Yuan hold true?

Its father was in the murky waters of Jingyang (泾阳),
and his rains came too late;
its son is also in the Black Waters of Hengyang (衡阳),
yet commits this evil.
Jing (泾) as Heng (衡),
perhaps the family custom.

It knows the Heavenly Tribunals sentenced Wei Zheng to behead its father,
yet does not know the Three Treasures journey west to retrieve scriptures,
to transcend and deliver its father;
nor does it know the Three Treasures retrieve scriptures
for whom’s sake—
with a muddled heart and perverse actions,
it even thinks of boiling the Tripitaka Master’s flesh for food,
a blazing lust of desire,
only caring to fulfill its cravings,
unknowing of its father’s nature,
unknowing of its own fate.

Alas!
Ignorance of nature and injury to filial duty—
what filth is worse than this?

「Its source already polluted, its current cannot but be unclean—
where then is purity to be found?

Within the chapter, the tale of the Heavenly Tribunals beheading the Black Waters Dragon is again raised,
to show that without cultivating the heart to nourish one’s nature,
one cannot serve the Heavenly Dao—
thus incurring the Heavenly Tribunals’ punishment.

Mao Kang gathered troops to avenge wrongs,
and in one battle, the dragon was captured—
the Tripitaka Master and Eight Rules were freed,
and the dragon was spared execution,
*"for the sake of my noble father’s face,"*
and sent westward.

Though the dragon’s accomplices were pardoned out of leniency,
this was truly inviting Heaven’s favor.

The heart governs the Six Desires,
and among them, the Black Waters Dragon’s desire is most difficult to restrain.

The immortal master composed another passage,
using veiled speech and allegory,
highlighting its core essence—
to awaken clarity of nature and purity of heart,
subtly contrasting with the Black Waters Dragon and its journey through the Underworld.
The passage merely points to its ambiguous heart,
and uses symbols to convey its meaning—
its intent is profound.

*"The River God summoned the art of obstructing the waters,
blocking the upper current.
Soon, the lower flow dried up,
and a great path opened."*

This is the method of uprooting and sealing the source,
forcing the waters against their nature
and preventing the lower flow—
truly the key to cultivating nature and attaining immortality.

The great path westward was revealed,
Red Boy was bound while the Black Crocodile returned,
and the Three Mysteries of pure cultivation were attained.

Yet why does the text say that whenever demons and monsters capture the Tripitaka Master,
they claim:
*"The Golden Cicada reincarnation,
a body of true yang refined over ten lifetimes—
if someone eats even a piece of his flesh,
it will extend their lifespan and grant eternal youth"*?

Because this text is written specifically for the Dao of Gold Elixir.
Those demons and monsters symbolize those who practice perverse, heretical methods,
hoping vainly for longevity—
they are likened to refining gold elixir into a tangible, substantial form,
hence the *"Golden Cicada reincarnation"*;
the *"true yang of the primordial body refined over ten lifetimes"*;
and the *"eating his flesh grants eternal youth"*.

They do not know that the Elixir of Rebirth is originally formless,
unlike the Tripitaka Master’s blood and flesh—
this is why they are considered heretical demons.

It boasts of its name, *"Mountain Until the Black River,"*
spanning tens of thousands of words,
a vast and profound discourse,
expounding the mysteries of the Dao,
all rooted in the benevolent cultivation of the heart
by Master Zhuang.

Some say this text belongs to the lineage of Zhong and Lü,
but they do not know it traces directly back to Mencius’ Dao.

The discerning may judge accordingly.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The Law Body and Primordial Fate Encounter the Ox-Cart’s Power**
**The Rectified Heart Overcomes the Heretical Demons at the Ridge Pass**

A scholar said: These three passages are specifically written to refute external Daoist sects.

External sects, like those seeking entry through side doors and alleys,
twisting and turning, devious and unorthodox,
are rarely able to attain true fruition—
why?

For those who advance at the proper time,
their foundation must align with the Heavenly Dao’s path.
External sects, however, are like galloping recklessly along walls and byways,
never finding their true path.

The multitude of heretical practices disrupts the scriptures,
their licentiousness only serves to destroy the body.

Within the chapter, the three Daoists—Peach Force, Deer Force, and Sheep Force—
embody the external sects in all their forms.

The external sects number three hundred and sixty,
but they are divided into three categories:
opening the Three Passes,
operating the Ox-Cart,
ascending the Ridge,
and the methods of mud pellets, chest supplementation, and returning essence—
all these are recorded in *The Yellow Court* and *The Spirit Pivot*,
along with the true scriptures of the immortals.
Later generations failed to receive the true transmission,
and passed on these methods in error—
they seem plausible but are fundamentally false,
the most likely to mislead and cause harm.

Guangchengzi said:
*"Cease your laborious efforts with the Ox-Cart and Elixir Furnace,
for the Blessed Embryo of the Crane and the Breath of the Tortoise
are naturally everlasting."*

Because the human body contains Heaven and Earth,
each inhalation and exhalation has its own roots and connections.
The Governing and Conception Vessels follow the movement of the qi,
forming the natural rotation of Heaven’s fate—
like the Ox-Cart.

Those who falsely practice opening the Three Passes,
turning the pulley,
and forcefully manipulate their essence,
disturbing their bones—
all these are unnatural,
contrary to Heaven and harmful to principle,
and sever the Great Dao.

They do not realize that the Ox-Cart is Heaven’s natural design,
its divine movement ceaseless—
once human interference begins,
it becomes choked and stagnant,
blood congeals and qi solidifies,
and strange poisons and chronic diseases arise—
this is truly the method of hastening death.

The border of Ox-Cart Country lies between the Black River and the Heaven-Piercing River,
embodying the meaning of the Ox-Cart’s stagnation.

The disciples heard the commotion
and assumed it was an earthquake, mountains collapsing,
thunderous claps of lightning,
and cries of people and neighing of horses—
all descriptions of unnatural, forced actions,
evoking dread and astonishment.

*"The Tripitaka Master saw many monks gathered in clusters,
pulling the cart with all their might,
and striking drums for power,"*
—this reveals their failure to harmonize the Five Phases,
to align with the natural unity of things,
and to follow the effortless Dao.

*"The cart was loaded with bricks, tiles, wood, and plants,"*
—this shows they were collecting dross, heavy and impure substances.

After recounting the high slopes, the narrow Ridge Pass, and the great pass,
*"How can the cart be pulled up such steep cliffs?"*
—all these directly point to their erroneous forcing of energy,
and their ignorance of the subtle marvels of the Ox-Cart’s natural rotation.

The Tripitaka Master transformed into the Cloud and Water Immortal,
and questioned the foreman Daoist about the reason—
then went straight to the riverbank,
passed the Twin Pass,
and descended the Ridge,
requiring no effort at all—
how effortlessly he moved with the circumstances!

The monks said:
*"He knows how to refine elixir and transmute mercury,
and turn stones into gold."*

If the external sects regard operating the Ox-Cart as internal alchemy,
and refining lead and mercury for consumption as external alchemy,
then this is their beginning and end—
leading the blind and believing in delusion,
like a madman or a wild horse,
and ultimately, never achieving success even unto old age.»

The lifespan may be slightly prolonged,
yet it is but a ghostly existence in a spectral abode.
Thus the venerable master said,
*"You cannot escape,"*
*"You cannot die."*
Neither death nor life—
not true longevity,
but merely prolonged suffering.

How could one attain the *arhat*’s journey to the Western Heaven for scriptures,
or the divine powers of the Heavenly Worthy of Equaling Heaven,
to redress this injustice among mortals?

The Tripitaka Master said:
*"Five hundred souls are kin to me."*
The Buddha spoke:
*"All sentient beings are my disciples."*
Originally boundless and impartial,
with neither inner nor outer distinctions—
yet now you cling so desperately—
what then is this vast compassion?

*"Unsheathing the Golden Hoop Staff,
a single strike to slay!"*
Just as Vajrapāṇi wields his demon-subduing scepter
to crush demons and deliver the monks.

The Tripitaka Master revealed his true form,
and the monks bowed in reverence,
begging him to subdue the demon and restore order.
*"Quickly drag the Ox-Cart past the Twin Pass,
through the Ridge,
lift it high and hurl it to shatter—
let the bricks, tiles, wood, and plants all tumble down the slope!"*

Truly excellent!
Truly excellent!

Restoring the original essence of the Law-body,
shattering the sluggishness of the demon’s strength,
upholding the loyal and virtuous single mind,
righting the crooked ridge of demonic deceit—
direct, swift, and resolute,
combining wisdom and courage.

Life and vitality—body, mind, essence, and breath—
everyone may preserve them whole.

Most wondrous is when the Great Sage plucks a hair,
each teaching twists it into the fingernail of the ring finger,
clenches it in a fist,
and calls—it answers instantly,
each summoning the Great Sage to appear and guard them,
so that no demonic intrusion may prevail.

The ring finger belongs to the heart,
speaking of how one’s thoughts may be as fine as hair—
firmly held in mind,
with every thought invoking the Sage,
how could there be any demonic obstruction?

Every person’s heart harbors Confucius,
every monk’s hand holds the Great Sage—
still and unmoving,
yet responsive when called—
the most profound and wondrous Dao.

The Master’s words are divine and wondrous;
readers must truly grasp their meaning.

This is the radiant wisdom,
like awakening from a dream—
when the old monk of Zhìyǔ Temple first saw the Tripitaka Master,
he bowed and called him "Grandfather"—
was it not Zhìbái Jinxīng saving human life in a dream?

The Three Monks secretly visited the Three Pure Ones’ Hall,
extinguishing the lamp’s light,
transforming into the Highest Venerable, Primordial Beginning, and Numinous Treasure,
demonstrating that Buddha is Taoist, Taoist is Buddha—
though teachings differ in schools,
their essence is one.

To neglect Zhìyǔ Temple
is to extinguish the Three Pure Ones’ Hall.

If both sides harbor deceit—
monks gluttonously stealing offerings,
Taoists hiding their ears and groping for the golden bell—
they invite the laughter of the discerning.

**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Sage Leaves His Name at the Three Pure Ones’ Hall, the Monkey King Reveals His Law in the Country of Carrying the Chariot**

Wùyī Zǐ says:
This passage elucidates the elixir of the Saintly Water—
born of cultivation, not supplication;
true nature and emptiness are one,
relying entirely on divine efficacy,
not on sensory indulgence.

It shatters false paths,
pointing to ultimate truth.

Cool and detached in tone,
yet everywhere a warning.

The Three Daoists—Hǔlì, Lùlì, and Yánglì—
proclaimed themselves Great Immortals,
chanting sutras to avert calamities and seek longevity for the realm.
Yet ignorant of the Dao’s true essence,
how could they discern the Three Pure Ones’ authenticity?

They suspected the Celestial Vessel’s descent,
kneeling to beg for the Saintly Water elixir—
like common folk worshipping stars or invoking spirit-writing tablets,
praying for extended life.
Their delusion knows no bounds!

The Great Sage agreed to leave the elixir,
yet the "Three Immortals" carried it in a bucket,
a basin, or a bottle—
like mortals clinging to *Bāduànjǐn*, *Liùzìjué*, or *Shíliùzì hūxī*,
or refining autumn stone and red lead to swallow,
each sealing their own vessel—
far surpassing even the *Chénglù jīnjīng*,
yet still grasping at longevity and celestial favor.
How absurd!

The three monks each indulged in their own *niè*—
not jesting, but profound insight.
For swallowing saliva or inhaling qi
are both matters of *yin* substance;
autumn stone and red lead,
when refined, yield filth and impurities—
often stemming from *niè*.
Thus, the Sage spoke plainly:
*"You drink but the urine of your own niè!"*

Even the Three Teachings’ sages have referenced *niè* in speaking of the Dao:
The Buddhist scriptures say, *"The Dao lies in the dry excrement stake."*
The *Nánhuá* [Zhuangzi] declares, *"The Dao is in excrement and urine."*
The *Dàxué* [Great Learning] warns, *"Like hating foul odors."*
Yet even in the most putrid transformation lies divine marvel—
the receptive and pure restoring the original.
In the most turbid depths lies the purest essence.
*Niè* is not entirely unworthy of mention in the Dao—
yet how laughable that seekers of the Dao should fixate upon it!

Truly wise, the Great Sage said,
*"Just leave my name instead."*
For mortals, lost in wild speculation,
knowing not the Dao’s nature,
he must shout aloud:
**"Dao/Hao! Dao/Hao!**
**You fool, lost in such chaotic thought!"**

There are Three Pure Ones—
would they deign to descend to mortal form?
I shall reveal my true surname,
and make you understand.

The Wayfarer has no father or mother—
how then could he have a surname?
His surname was bestowed by the Ancestor of Bodhi,
the true transmission of life’s essence.

The surname is the very nature itself.
If you say, *"You take the Dao as your name,"*
do you truly know the Dao’s name?
Why such wild and groundless speculation?

Could the Three Pure Ones of highest sanctity
ever descend to this turbid world
and lightly cross over the common folk?
It is only because you do not know your true nature.

Now I shall reveal your true nature to you—
do you not know that all you consume
are but the urine of *niè*?
This is no forced interpretation—
observe *"Just leave my name instead"*—
why does it not leave a name,
but only speak of *"surname"*?
And why does it not leave a surname,
but only say *"true surname"*?

When you reach the closing line—*"fully realized in nature"*—
you will understand.

The Sage-Teachers used *"the Great Sage leaves a name"*
as a hook to draw attention,
to clarify the Dao’s true designation—
only the true nature itself.

In ancient times, the Divine Maiden conceived by Heaven’s grace,
and thus the character *"surname"* (姓) bears the radical *"woman"* (女).
For *"surname"* inherently contains the marvelous Dao
of nature’s generation and transformation.

Ah!
The surname is used to name,
the surname is used to represent nature,
the surname is used to name the Dao,
the surname is used to answer the call.

Spoken casually, yet each word is the Dao—
profound, unfathomable, divine!
Wondrous!

The Master and his disciples attended court, where the Old Daoist made a report, the Great Sage gave his account, and the Village Elder presented his petition—all recounting how the Carriage-Slow Kingdom sought rain through a contest of Buddhist and Daoist magical arts. The Sage-Teachers then explained the rain-invocation method to illustrate the vast difference between heterodox and orthodox Dao. It was not merely to showcase the Great Sage’s superior technique.

The Dao, fundamentally, is one nature permeating all things, revealing the true essence while harmonizing principle and practice. It transcends all oppositions in duality, merging with all things while operating alone. It is not a technique to be confined by techniques; it is not a display to be confined by displays. One cannot grasp the Dao by clinging to manifest techniques.

*"The Daoist ascends the platform, using the talisman as his signal."*
The talisman is but wood’s qi. One sound, two sounds, three sounds, four sounds—all commands arranged through tone and color. This is true technique, yet not the true nature.

The nature’s resonance has fixed responses, but techniques’ summons are unreliable. Thus, winds, clouds, thunder, and rain sometimes answer and sometimes do not.

The Great Sage used the staff as his signal.
The *Ruyi Staff* embodies the complete principle of the Five Phases.
One finger, two fingers, three fingers, four fingers, five fingers—all applied through divine transformation. This is true nature, encompassing true technique.

When technique empties, it becomes technique; when technique manifests, it reveals nature. Thus, winds, clouds, thunder, and rain always respond without fail.

This is what is meant by *"stabilizing nature and preserving spirit,"* practicing silently in meditation, with divine power operating alone—without loud incantations or displays of color.

If one speaks of technique apart from nature, it is like invoking rain through techniques alone—abandoning the root for the branches, not the true nature’s wondrous method.

Thus, the Wanderer says:
*"This is heterodox magic, not a true fruit of attainment—neither mine nor yours. If you can summon the Dragon King to appear in person,"*
then true nature is revealed, motion and stillness in harmony, hidden and manifest unfathomable—neither confined to display nor bound by technique.

The Wanderer’s call brought the Dragon King swiftly to manifest his true form:
*"Four dragons soared through mist and cloud, dancing toward the Golden Throne Hall."*
Breath and response in perfect communion—how vast and swift their operation!

How could those heterodox external arts ever steal such transformations or measure their extent?

The conclusion states:
*"The boundless, wondrous true method—
the utterly true nature shatters heterodoxy."*
This has already been made clear.

In the past, Master Lü heard Master Huanglongji’s Dharma talk. The master asked:
*"Who sits below?"*
Lü replied:
*"A wandering Daoist of clouds and water."*
The master said:
*"What if the clouds disperse and the water dries up?"*
Lü had no answer.

The master continued:
*"The Yellow Dragon appears."*
Lü suddenly awakened—realizing the Dragon’s manifestation was true nature, while refining water into gold was yet to grasp the true essence.

He left this verse:
*"Since first seeing the Yellow Dragon,
I scorn my past mistaken efforts."*

The Wanderer’s summoning of the Dragon King after the clouds dispersed and the water dried is the same meaning.

Those late learners of shallow arts, abandoning true nature for heterodoxy—how little they understand the true call!

---
**Chapter 46: External Forces Play Tricks, the Heart of the Orthodox Dao Triumphs—The Monkey King Reveals His Might and Destroys All Heresy**

A disciple of enlightenment says:
This passage clarifies that true nature, refined a hundred times, is unbreakable, while all heterodox paths will ultimately perish.

The human body is rare—one must urgently seek a true teacher, sincerely pursue genuine learning, and never indulge in craving the strange or seeking victory. Beware of straying into heterodox paths and inviting ruin upon oneself.

The Daoist, misplaced in his arts, ashamed to admit defeat, sought to challenge seated meditation for victory in fame.
*"The Cloud Ladder"*—heterodox and external.

The seated meditation school is the method of closing and stilling the breath, like forgetting all schemes and cutting off all thoughts, entering samadhi and transcending the mind. Yet, since spirit belongs to yin, it cannot yield true fruit.

Ancients compared it to grinding bricks to make mirrors—those beneath this level are called *"crowd-stakes of wood."* Here, it is called *"Cloud Ladder,"* roughly meaning coiled sitting, focusing thought on the crown, gradually ascending higher, hoping to rise into the sky through false teachings—clearly the deceit of demons, a true external path!

Since the Buddha has no seated form, seated Buddhas are killing Buddhas. Thus, the Wanderer says:
*"Speak of seated meditation, and I already concede.
Where is this ‘seated nature’ to be found?"*

Tang Sanzang said:
*"In my youth, I met a mountain-dwelling Zen monk who taught that stabilizing nature and preserving spirit—even at the gates of life and death—required seated meditation for two or three years."*
This shows that seated meditation is not true Zen but idle talk from a wandering monk in his youth.

Not only two or three years, but seated meditation to old age—it still avails nothing. True Zen is not confined to sitting.

The Tiger’s Strength leapt upward, and Tang Sanzang plucked him from the air—this depicts the false state of rising through thought.

Yet why, when struck by a great stinkbug, did he shrink his neck, and when bitten by a long centipede, did he get a nosebleed?
There is profound meaning here.

Those deeply versed in seated meditation practice on stinking bones and cultivate stillness on poisonous hearts.

The Buddhist scriptures say:
*"Sitting while alive, lying while dead—
just a stinking bone, why bother with practice?"*

The Daoist scriptures say:
*"Troublesome poisonous snakes sleep in your heart."*
This is what Lü Gong tested the monk’s Zen nature with, revealing him as a small snake.

As for *"guessing through the partition,"* it is the art of *shèfù*—mastery of the *Liu Ren Qi Men* divination, relying on fortune-telling and conjecture. Even if one excels in such arts, it has nothing to do with the body, heart, or true nature—also an external path.

Inside the cabinet:
*"Mountains, rivers, fields, and millet—
Heaven and Earth, geography—*
how did they turn into a *"broken, discarded bell"*?

「The myriad things have no fixed essence, yet their principles align in harmony.
The refinement of *two* is not as precise as that of *one*,
the ornate is not as concise as the plain,
the noble is not as secure as the humble.

The new will inevitably lean toward obscurity,
while the enduring cannot safeguard its transformations.

The eyes cannot be trusted,
wisdom cannot peer into the unseen,
and calculations cannot bind the true.

The remembrance of past reversals brings manifold omissions and illuminations,
while stillness in waiting reveals no form can escape observation.

Divine clarity and insight reside within the person—
thus, the Dao of supreme sincerity
is true knowing and genuine seeing,
not reliant on conjecture,
yet capable of foresight.

Why does the *lùlù* [鹿鹿] act thus?
Its strength is deficient, yet this is its inherent nature.

And what of guessing the *immortal peach*?
Why does it become a pit?

For limbs are easily stripped away,
while great fruits are never eaten—
falling like bubbles, only *virtue* endures.

Those who glimpse with skill
hold a complete bamboo in their chest;
those who strike with precision
see no whole ox in their gaze.

The adept do not cling to mere traces,
perceiving the boundless *generative transformations* within;
the shallow only observe the surface,
missing the wondrous *mutual transformations* beyond.

Divine luminosity moves in silence,
changing yet ever in flux—
coming and going without fixed form,
even spirits and deities cannot fathom it.
Hence, the sage values mastery of the *Yì* [《易》].

Why does the *divine ram* [神羊] have intelligence?
Its strength is deficient—
is this not fitting?

And what of guessing the *Daoist soil* [道土],
only to see it turn into a *monk* [和尚]?
Marvelous, this transformation!
The mortal is effaced in the *void*,
while the immortal and the Buddha merge as one.

The *Old Monkey* [老孙] becomes a *Daoist adept*,
and the *Buddhist teacher* [佛师] is the *Daoist master* [道师];
the *Daoist novice* [道童] turns into a *Buddhist disciple*,
for *Daoists* are originally *Buddhist followers* [佛徒].

*"Shaving the head bare"*—
what law ever had hair?
The *law beyond law* surpasses all laws;
*"donning the yellow robe"*—
emptiness far outweighs mere hue,
the *true color* of color reaches its ultimate.

The wooden fish is struck—
within, the *Yellow Court* [《黄庭》] is secretly chanted;
the voice *"Āmítuó"* [阿弥陀] is uttered—
splitting the spine to emerge from the world.

*"Bursting forth in unison, all chanting in harmony"*
is the moment of celestial blossoms descending.

*"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name."*」

"Those who cling to names and fixed forms,
with eyes like a tiger’s, glaring and menacing—
how vulgar they are!

The tiger’s strength is but a feeble show,
for it is its own delusion that blinds it.

The Three Powers* [三力] fail to reflect upon their learning,
instead wallowing in side paths;
hard to deceive by the true *dharma* [正法],
yet they conjure many illusory arts,
foolishly hoping to achieve their ends.

The *practitioners* [行者] of such ways
then use their very own techniques
to slay themselves—
what purpose could they have?

In ancient times, there were those who fought
and lost their heads yet still spoke,
‘*Even without a head, it is fine*’ [无头亦佳],
who joyfully endured flaying of flesh and heart,
or plunged into boiling caldrons like honeyed rice,
all forged through the tempering of their original *true nature* [本真性],
treating the body as illusion,
not letting illusion ensnare the body.

*Qi* [教气] may gather or disperse,
*principle* [理] transcends gathering and dispersing;
grasp the *principle*, and vast *qi* [浩气] abides with it.

The form may die or live,
*nature* [性] knows no death nor life;
know the *nature*, and the spirit remains unobscured.

A ruler may be without *virtue* [圣] or without *non-virtue* [不圣],
yet loyalty must never waver;
a father may be without kindness or without unkindness,
yet filial devotion must never falter.

There are those with the spirit to master blades and fire,
yet blades and fire do not bend nor oppress them—
as if blades and fire were but illusions.

This is like the *practitioner*’s *Great Unity Golden Essence* [太乙金精],
which has been refined through the *Eight Trigrams Furnace* [八卦炉],
a single moment of *true nature* [真性] manifesting in this way.

Thus, those who cultivate their *true nature*
face great calamities or critical junctures,
like *Bo Qi* [伯奇] and *Xiao Si* [孝巳],
*Bo Yi* [伯邑考] and *Shen Sheng* [申生],
who died for filial *virtue* [孝];
*Guan Longfeng* [关龙逢] and *Wen Tianxiang* [文天祥],
whose bodies were separated yet spirits unbroken,
akin to those who joyfully endure heart-splitting;
*Sun Jue* [孙揆] severed by the saw,
and *Fang Xiaoru* [方孝孺], *Tie Xuan* [铁铉],
*Jing Qing* [景清], *Huang Zicheng* [黄子澄],
*Lian Zining* [练子宁], who died in pieces for loyalty—
all were wise and preserved their bodies,
yet perfected their *true nature* [真了命],
unharmed in any way.

But those like *Kong Guang* [孔光],
*Hu Du* [胡度], *Su Weidao* [苏味道],
*Chu Yuan* [褚渊], and *Feng Dao* [冯道],
who fled calamities to save their lives,
though they lived long—
had already lost their *true nature*,
and thus marred their limbs in vain.

The *practitioners*’ entire *true nature* [本真性之全体]
is not an illusion;
it merely manifests through the body and sets forth *dharma*,
to distinguish the true from the false.

Thus the summary states:
‘*Manifest the sacred, extinguish the demonic*’ [显圣灭邪].

The head may be cut off,
but the *true nature*’s head cannot be severed—
‘*still grows anew*’ [长出一个],
yet chopping does not truly chop.

The belly may be split open,
but the *true nature*’s belly cannot be rent—
‘*remains whole as before*’ [依然长合],
yet splitting does not truly split.

The oil calamity cannot be endured,
yet the *true nature* may be immersed—
‘*playing in waves, defying the flames*’ [翻波顽耍],
for the oil calamity cannot harm the *true nature*.

The marvel lies in the passage:
‘*The practitioner feigns death within the oil pot*’ [油锅内行者假死],
a reminder to the world:
know only the *true nature*’s operation—
piercing metal, passing through stone,
entering water yet not drowning,
plunging into fire yet not burning;
weapons cannot harm the body,
tigers and rhinos cannot wound the form;
emerging alive, vanishing unharmed—
life and death in perfect accord,
not bound by knowledge of life and death,
nor by thoughts of gain or loss.

The moment one clings to knowledge of life and death, heart and intention,
one carries along the defilements of dust and fate—
unable to reach this state.

San Zang’s funeral prayer reads:
*“In life, I sought only the Dharma’s intent;
in death, I still cherish the Buddha’s mind.”*
This clings to knowledge of life and death, heart and intention—
losing the true Way.

Thus, the Eight Precepts say:
*“Master, this is not the right invocation.”*
*“The ignorant Primal Horse Attendant”*—
not bound by knowledge;
*“The damned Monkey King”*—
not constrained by life and death.

*“The Monkey King settled the account”*—
what heart remains?
*“The Horse Attendant severed the root”*—
what intention lingers?
*“The Practitioner could not endure—
revealing his true form”*—
clearly depicting a mass of true nature.

For nature knows no life and death—
the claim that death reveals the spirit
is not the ultimate truth.

Hearing this, the Practitioner lunged, struck, and shouted:
*“What spirit do I reveal?”*
Speaking of nature as the vitality of life,
not the spirit displayed after death.

Those who study the Dao should cultivate the true nature
while yet alive—
that is sufficient.

San Zang knew not the true nature,
erring toward false paths.
In life, he practiced the illusory arts of Mao Shan—
flaying the body, forging external cold dragons,
summoning rain, calling wind,
turning gold, refining mercury,
vainly hoping for longevity and national salvation,
pursuing the superficial while neglecting the root—
self-deceived and deceiving others.

He knew that false learning could fool the ignorant,
but did not know that falsehood, prolonged, leads to ruin.
He knew that snares could warn the vulgar,
but did not know that snares, prolonged, bring destruction.

Thus, the Tiger’s head did not escape the dog’s jaws,
the deer’s entrails fed the eagles’ bellies,
the sheep’s bones boiled to ruin in the pot—
the cold dragon could not save them.
This is why the King wailed:
*“Without the true transmission, do not forge the elixir—
your scheming mind brings no security.”*
And again:
*“What good are gold-turning and mercury refining?
Summoning rain and calling wind—all in vain.”*
How profoundly he saw the truth!

**Chapter Forty-Seventh**
*The Holy Monk Blocks the Heavenly River*
*The Golden Wood Extends Mercy to Save the Child*

Yu Yi Zi said:
The King of Car Wheel mistakenly trusted the power of the Heavenly Chariot,
nearly losing his life.
Thanks to the Practitioner shattering the vehicle,
the demonic Daoist was swiftly removed,
the true nature preserved,
and the land secured.
Once enlightened, he became a wise sage,
knowing that the Zen gate holds the Dao—
one must not be partial.

*“Honor the monk, honor the Daoist,
nurture talent”*—
truly, the Three Teachings converge in one nature,
the boundless wisdom of the true path.

Nature is Heaven.
Knowing nature is knowing—
originally, it is one and unbroken.
It is the genuine study of Heavenly Communication.

The Immortal Master feared that people would know *nature as nature*,
yet fail to know *nature as the very essence of being*—
distinguishing between partial and complete, pure and mixed,
grasping one aspect while neglecting the whole,
stagnant and unenlightened,
like one lost in darkness, blocked from progress.
Thus, he specially inscribed the three essentials of the Heavenly River,
depicting the Great Sage’s bamboo basket catching fish—
a marvelous metaphor to guide all ages through the mist,
the true Dharma-eye beyond scripture,
the secret essence of *Oneness Restoring to the Primordial*.

If scholars grasp this truth,
the nature-body returns to its source,
and the Golden Elixir’s path is complete.

Yet the Heavenly Communication path is vast and unobstructed—
few can walk it, though all possess it inherently.
San Zang asked:
*“Where shall we lodge tonight?”*
The Practitioner replied:
*“At the home of a man.”*
The text says:
*“A household offering alms.”*
*“A cluster of homes appeared.”*
*“Four or five hundred households.”*
*“Straight to the door of a home.”*
Later, each phrase subtly awakens the eye to *“home”*—
using the Chen Family Village as the skeleton,
hinting with brushstrokes that are neither direct nor detached,
like ash-snake grass-thread,
making readers trace and ponder endlessly.
Only at the closing of later chapters does its genius reveal itself—
as in *“This supreme treasure every home possesses,
yet fools fail to recognize it fully.”*

---

When the Master of the Three Treasures (San Zang) sought lodging from the old man,
the old man said:
*“From the Eastern Land to my place,
there are fifty-four thousand *li* of road—
how could you, alone and solitary,
traverse such a distance?”*

The Master of the Three Treasures replied:
*“I still have three disciples,
who protect this poor monk,
and thus I have arrived here.”*

Indeed, the Heavenly Communication (Tong Tian) path lies at the center of the ten-eight thousand (ten thousand eight thousand) *li*,
a Daoist path of perfect balance,
admitting no deviation or slightest error—
one who clings rigidly to solitary practice alone
could never reach it.

At this point, all hearers are astonished and perplexed,
none daring to accept its truth.

Thus, the Master of the Three Treasures called out:
*“Disciples, come here!”*
The old man, seeing them, was so terrified he collapsed to the ground—
the source of his cries of alarm and revulsion.

Yet who could know that within them lay the power to subdue dragons and tame tigers?
It is not a matter of belief or disbelief.

When the Master and his disciples finished their alms-keeping (zhai),
the old man bowed and said:
*“You seek the Sutras (taking dharma) —
why not walk the proper Dao?
Instead, you’ve stumbled back here?”*

The Practitioner replied:
*“We walked the proper Dao,
but a current of water blocked our way,
and we could not cross.”*

Each question and answer
clearly reveals that the Heavenly Communication River (Tong Tian He)
is the very path of Daoist cultivation,
and arriving at Chen Family Village (Chen Jia Zhuang)
marks the discovery of the essential means to cross it.

Though it seems not the proper path,
in truth, it is the proper path.

He then spoke of *“Lord of the Mystic Response”* (Ling Gan Da Wang).
*“Ling”* refers to the vital force of generation,
*“Gan”* to the interplay of clouds and rains—
though sweet dew and auspicious clouds
are sufficient to nourish all things,
yet unrestrained indulgence
can still harm the true vital essence (zhenyuan).

Within grace lies destruction,
beneath kindness lies injury—
ever consuming true yin and true yang,
like one who devours young boys and girls.

This metaphor speaks to its hidden subtleties—
not that he truly consumes young boys and girls!

Hence it is said:
*“Only because you love to devour young boys and girls,
are you not the radiant and upright deity.”*
Rather, it is the profound essence of transformation,
the merging of yin and yang at their utmost refinement,
which cannot be superficially discerned by mere appearances.

The old man said:
*“Our place belongs to the jurisdiction of the County of Original Assembly (Yuan Hui Xian),
within the realm of the Carriage-Delay Country (Che Chi Guo),
and is called Chen Family Village.”*
*“Yuan”* means true vital essence (真元),
*“Hui”* means the cyclical convergence of fate (运会) —
a ceaseless turning wheel,
a substance inherent in every home.

Thus, it is known that Chen Xuanzang dwells in Chen Family Village,
and Chen Family Village contains Xuanzang—
Xuanzang does not depart from Chen Family Village,
for they share the same vital breath (tizong yiqi),
not two distinct lineages,
nor something sought beyond the home
while lost within it.

*“One *Catty* of Gold”* (Yi Chèng Jīn) —
though its name is *young girl*,
she is but eight years old,
yet holds the true yang of sixteen *catty*;
*“Chen’s Gatekeeper”* (Chen Guan Bǎo) —
though its name is *young boy*,
he is but seven years old,
yet embodies the true yin of fourteen *catty*.

*“The rotating rites of sacrifice”* (Lúncì Jìsài) —
plainly, it instructs each household to display its treasures;
*“Preparing alms for the departed”* (Yù Xiū Wáng Zhāi) —
a call to cultivate the art of a virtuous death (shan si) early.

*“One *Catty* of Gold”* is the standard of balanced qi and flavor;
*“Gatekeeper”* is the beginning and end of the *Gate of the Phoenix* (Guan) and the *Heavenly Protector* (Chi).

This supreme treasure,
even if abandoned for broken wealth,
where could one purchase ten thousand *liang* of gold?

*“Mysterious and responsive in essence,
knowing greatness and smallness, beauty and ugliness,
the years and months of life—
nothing can alter it.”*

Ah! Marvelous indeed!

「*"Guanbao"* is the practitioner’s transformed body,
the practitioner becomes *Guanbao*—
how could there ever be two?
One transformation yields two,
a marvelous shift from odd to even—
please recognize that the *yin within yang* is **Water and Gold**.

*"Chengjin"* is the manifestation of the Eight Precepts (Bājiè),
the Eight Precepts transform into *Chengjin*—
truly, it is as if one is eight,
*yang generates yin*—
one must discern that the *yin within yang* is **Wood and Fire**.

These two supreme treasures resemble the **elixir essence** (dāntóu),
originally requiring two **elixir cauldrons** (dānwǎn).
When **Gold and Wood** harmonize and dispel the *fetus* (yàozi),
it is but the **essence of the Golden Fish**—
a single flavor.

First consume the male, then the female—
a metaphor for two stages of practice,
not bound to physical form or substance,
how could there be harm or injury?
The **Golden Elixir’s** beginning and end hold true marvelous methods,
too profound to utter, let alone fathom.

Once *"造化"* (Zàohuà) is grasped,
its principle revealed,
the door is opened,
and the male and female lifted—
already, the entire truth is laid bare.
Not contrived, nor forced—
originally, it has no artifice.
All medicinal substances of *yin* and *yang* are contained here;
do not recklessly conjecture or stray into false paths,
lest you weep and wail, entreating your fate in vain.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
*Magic Whips the Cold Wind, Snow Falls in Sheets*
*The Monk Ponders Worshipping the Buddha on Layered Ice*

Master **Wu Yi** said: *"The Zhuangzi* states:
‘The northern sea has a fish,
which transforms into a *Peng* (peng).’
The fish is the *yang within yin*;
the northern sea belongs to **Water**—
a parable hinting at **true gold within water**.

Its transformation into the *Peng* is the **Vermilion Bird** (Zhūquè).
The south belongs to **Fire**;
**Nine Ten Thousand** (jiǔ wàn) of southward flight—
the *yang* essence has reached its peak;
**Fire can again generate Wood**.

In summary, this endless cycle of the **Golden Fish essence** within water,
an unceasing transformation—
the adept who can gather this **essence of Water and Gold**,
what fear is there of not attaining **sainthood, immortality, or Buddhahood**?

Many are the **lowly scholars** (xiàshì),
not only unwilling to deeply believe,
but all mocking it as **empty delusion** (□鴳).
They do not know this **Dao** is most urgent, most true, most near, most simple—
absolutely not frivolous or fantastical.

Those who fail to grasp this
are like those who have a home yet do not know where it lies,
still wandering in the realm of **drunken life and dreamlike death**.»

The account of the Chen Family Village gathering’s rites and sacrifices unfolds thus:
Those who could truly believe and act upon the **Eight Precepts’** transformations
would proceed to Linggan Temple,
where they would recognize the **golden-character spirit tablet**,
kneel and follow its dictates—
this is called **clarity and purity of the master’s intent**,
daring not to muddle through the customary observances,
only then returning to their own homes.

Ah, the **Great Sage** and **Tianpeng** spoke:
*"Let us return to our own home."*
*"Where is your home?"*
*"To sleep at Old Chen’s place."*
*"Fool! You’re babbling again."*
*"You call me a fool! Just teasing him—why take it seriously?"*
*"To be fully human is to begin and end with sincerity."*
Each knock met its response,
mutual revelation stirring even the wanderer abroad
to yearn for his homeland,
the exile in distant lands
to tighten the reins of return.

Every home has its own home—
do not lodge in another’s.
Every home still has its own—
do not dream of another’s as your own.
To cease being a fool,
to jest and pass through—
that is true.
To speak nonsense yet begin and end with sincerity—
that is enlightenment.

The striking of the gong
resonates clear and piercing—
how much more than the evening drum and morning bell
to awaken the lost from slumber!

The **Pilgrim’s** exchange with the monster
merely reveals an old household custom.

When the **Eight Rules** manifested as a monster,
it had already found two **heaven-piercing giant scales**.
Having traced its path,
there was a method to capture it.

Returning to Chen’s home,
all were unharmed—
hosts and guests, masters and disciples—
united in joyful conversation, their delight evident.

The **Water’s gold** harbors **true yin and true yang**,
the **qi of the Five Phases and Four Seasons**.
It was originally Chen’s own possession,
yet not yet subdued.

The fish leaps in the deep—
the **Dao** reveals itself naturally.

The **Dao** is the **Dao**; I return to myself—
no entanglement with it.
I am confined within the **Dao**,
yet the **Dao** plays with me.

Birth, old age, sickness, death—
arising, dwelling, subsiding, emptiness—
all stem from the **Dao**.

The child of **creation** acts without intent;
**Tang Seng** seeks the **Sutra** with desperate urgency.
To strive against **creation’s flow**,
to contend and oppose—
this is the **Water’s gold**, not yet tamed,
and so it harbors the impulse to torment **Tang Seng**,
for **Tang Seng’s** own urgent, self-driven pursuit is its cause.

Ah, the **compassionate heart** of the **Carp Grandmother**,
saving **Tang Seng** from the monster,
demonstrating the **good method** of refining the **restless mind**.

If one sees this as aiding demons in cruelty,
it is to cling to literal forms,
not to grasp the author’s intent—
how can one fathom the **Heart Sutra’s** profundity?

The **Heart Sutra’s** marvel lies in **non-attachment**.
A mind fixed on objects is not the **wonderful mind**.
Once, a **wild fox** disguised as a woman
could discern where a man’s mind dwelled—
for the mind was fixed upon something.

**Master Daan** placed his mind in the **Four Fruitions of Arhat**,
yet the fox could not find it.
I say: the fox was merely a fox—
the mind that sought was its own fixation;
how could it search everywhere and fail?

I knew it through the very mind that sought.
What mind of mine knew it?

The **Tang Seng**’s mind to retrieve the scriptures was most urgent—urgent in his progress, unaware of retreat or survival, each with its own signs. How could he know that opposing the **Dao**’s natural unfolding only brings harm to himself?

The **Guanpo** said, *“I have long known that Your Majesty has the **Dao**-transcending power to summon winds and call rains, to churn the seas and overturn rivers.”*

When **Tang Seng** reached the riverbank, seeing the winds stilled and waves calm, he sought a flat-bottomed boat and crossed in an instant. Yet once in midstream, the **Dao**’s power and **qi** manifested—unexpected, swift, and decisive. Why resort to crude tactics of whipping winds, summoning snow, or freezing ice to ensnare him?

To stir winds and summon snow, to freeze the river—was it not to deliberately obstruct him, preventing swift passage and thus thwarting his **Dao**-transcending power? To make the crossing treacherous, forcing caution and thus dampening his **qi** and power? Was this not the **good method** of saving the monk and subduing the demon?

When the great snow fell and the ice grew bitterly cold, the cold penetrated to the core, and the plum blossoms bloomed in response. When faced with the extraordinary, strategy revived—thus, the extreme of cold births harmony, and the most blocked paths open. Without enduring severe cold, one cannot refine the true nature.

Eight hundred layers of ice—this was the most perilous path. To brave danger was to fall into traps; to recognize peril was to walk with caution. Thus, one who treads on a tiger’s tail receives its bite, and one who steps on frost knows its threat. Without plunging into the deepest abyss, one cannot still the restless mind.

**Guanpo** had long understood **Tang Seng**’s impulsive, restless nature. Precisely because this was the **Dao**-aligned path to heaven, she devised this trial—to temper his nature with cold and still his mind with the abyss. Was she not perhaps the very embodiment of the Great Earth?

How do we know this? Observe how the **Great Sage Equaling Heaven** did not wait for the **Journeyer’s** report but rushed to the bamboo grove to forge weapons. **Guanpo** was the **Great Sage**—when the **Great Sage** captured the fish, **Guanpo** was not present. The **Great Sage** was **Guanpo**. Every word and deed of **Guanpo** served only to protect **Tang Seng** and aid the **King of the River**.

It is clear: the **Spirit-Sensing King** is but a **Spirit-Sensing Bodhisattva**. The title remains, yet the **King** is transformed by a **Bodhisattva**. Then the **King’s** winds, his great snows, his manipulation of **Tang Seng**—were they not **Guanpo’s** manipulation of the **King** and **Tang Seng**, all of it the **Great Sage’s** manipulation of the **King** and **Tang Seng**, all in accordance with the Buddha’s will to guide the scripture-seeker?

**San Zang** said, *“This season is strange—I do not know if it is spring, summer, autumn, or winter.”* He saw that the **Dao** of heaven follows its natural course, and one must know its signs.

Again, he said, *“I did not know of the mountains and rivers’ dangers.”* He saw that the **Dao** of earth follows fixed principles, and one must know its changes.

Again, he said, *“In this world, nothing is heavier than name and profit. Others risk death for gain; my disciple serves the edict with loyalty—yet it is still for fame. How does this differ?”* He saw that greed for profit and fame are burdens, and one must know their harm.

If the restless mind is indulged, if one treads carelessly upon the layered ice, then one becomes a plaything of fate for eternity, unable to be a master of one’s own life. Thus, one must penetrate the **yin-yang**, deeply understand the times, know when to advance and retreat, guard against danger and foresee risk, abandon schemes and sever thoughts, still the form and rest the mind—only then can one remain true to the **Way**.

If one rushes forward in haste, it is as if one has passed the mark. The **Way** lies before you, yet you stumble past it. **Sha Wujing’s** words, *“In haste, one fears mistakes,”* are a sharp warning.

The **River of Heaven’s Passage** is the true path to retrieve the scriptures. The monsters within have not yet been subdued—how can one cross? The **gold in water** is the **Dao**’s marvel—true gold has not yet been obtained, and without it, there is no way to worship the Buddha.

The scriptures are the **gold in water**, not mere words. The Buddha is present in the world, not only in the Western Paradise. To seek the Buddha while recklessly risking danger—why not stay at Chen’s house to avoid error?

The **grass-shoe horse** was hasty; to walk on ice was reckless. To step into the abyss and sink to the depths—**Tang Seng** brought this upon himself. What blame is there for the monster?

**Guanpo** said, *“I dare not! I dare not!”*

For now, let him be. Better to endure two days, leisurely and at ease, enjoying oneself.

How reverent, cautious, and composed! Not only does this spare Tang Seng harm, but it also allows the monster to be contained, opens the door for the three disciples to rescue the drowning, and preserves the Great Sage’s ground for subduing demons. Who else but an embodiment of effortless transformation could do this?

The three disciples returned to Chen’s village and explained the spirit’s trickery. They headed straight to the water’s edge to seek their master and capture the monster—the moment of returning to origin and restoring essence lies here.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Monk Faces Calamity and Sinks into a Watery Abode—Guan Yin Appears in a Fish Basket to Save the Peril**

Wu Yi Zi said: *Gold elixir* is the convergence of true yin and true yang qi, following the natural cycles of Heaven and Earth through the four seasons and seventy-two solar terms, returning to the primal origin without artificial coercion. Only when one penetrates Lao Zi’s subtle and wondrous teachings does one realize the Dao’s simplicity and effortless ease—taking and consuming it grants fulfillment of nature and life, instantly ascending to sainthood.

This passage reveals the marvelous application of subduing the gold elixir, the secret essence of Guan Yin’s mission to Chang’an to relieve suffering and save from peril, marking the grand source and culmination of *The Scripture of Liberation from Calamity*. Its placement in the forty-ninth chapter underscores the *Great Correlation*’s number of fifty, with its full use manifesting in forty-nine—here lies its significance.

The immortal’s brush cannot fully convey its depth, so only Guan Yin’s miraculous fish-basket form is depicted to illuminate later generations. Its profound implications are boundless, encompassing all phenomena—only those who master yin-yang and comprehend the workings of creation can glimpse its essence. To say *Journey to the West* lacks ingenuity, relying solely on invoking the Southern Sea Bodhisattva in crises, is as blind as groping for a *zheng* (上“竹”下“龠”) in the dark.

The second disciple devised a plan to descend into the water to seek their master. When Zhu Bajie carried the real and false bodies of the disciple, it signified their shared resolve—urgent need to question a friend and seek their master. How could one not recognize another’s true form when there are forms beyond the body?

*"I’m right here, Old Monkey!"*
But calling to the deaf awakens no fool—*"You’re still carrying me!"*
At the sound of the song, your original form remains.

*Hurry, hurry—no delay!*
Lift your head—this is the Water Turtle’s domain.

Transformed into Shrimp Mother, question Shrimp Grandma—
The Great-Bellied One speaks of vitality;
Encounter Stone Lizi, listen to Stone Xiang—
The Living Tomb’s true master weeps over the path to death.

If the disciples could find their master together, what fear is there that the true scriptures won’t reach home?

The monk wept in grief, recounting the watery disaster—not out of hatred for water, but acknowledging that from birth to return to the source, water’s role is indispensable, never to be overlooked.

The disciple called out: *"Master, do not grieve over the watery calamity. The scriptures say: ‘Earth is the mother of the Five Phases; wood is the source of the Five Phases. Without earth, nothing grows; without water, nothing thrives.’"* This echoes the meaning: *"The Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth; the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams cannot depart from it."* The point is clear—no need for further annotation.

Having clarified the situation, the disciple ordered Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing to enter the water to fight separately—why? The monster is the *true gold in water*, a convergence of yin-yang and the Five Phases’ qi, already formed. Yet, obstructed by the talisman’s solar fire, its time has not come, so it cannot return to origin and attain its true fruition. Only Zhu Bajie’s wood-fire refinement and Sha Wujing’s true earth can subdue it.

*"Wielding a nine-pronged red copper mallet"*—a symbol of pure yang, standing alone and unyielding.

Zhu Bajie said: *"You fake being the Spirit King of Illusions, devouring children in Chen’s village! I’m Chen Qing’s one-catty gold—don’t you recognize me?"*
Not to make the king recognize him, but to let those refining the elixir do so.

At this moment, only a female form appears—no mention of boys. Beneath the water, a fierce battle unfolds among the three. Do not mistake this for the initial convergence of the Five Phases forming the embryo—this is the later stage of ten-month fire refinement after the embryo is formed.

The verse reads: *"With fate and affinity, the Dao is complete"*—yin-yang union.
*"Mutual generation and conquest, as countless as grains of sand"*—fire refinement.
*"Earth conquers water; water dries up to the bottom"*—water solidifies with earth.
*"Water generates wood; wood flourishes in blossom"*—wood thrives with water.

In Chan practice, this merges into unity;
In elixir refinement, the three families are distinctly subdued.
*"Earth is the mother, sprouting golden buds—
Golden water births the infant"*—earth generates gold and water.
*"Water is the root, nourishing wooden flowers—
Wood radiates fiery splendor"*—wood and fire refine the gold.
*"The Five Phases converge yet remain distinct—
Thus the faces change, each contending differently"*—
During refinement, though still converging, the fire’s intensity shifts constantly, each phase distinct—hence the monk’s battle with the monster involves ever-changing forms.

To read this verse merely as Five Phases generation-conquest rhetoric misses its profundity.

*"The two feigned defeat, luring it out to battle."*

The refining is yet incomplete—
Again it is quenched in water.
*"The fire’s power is insufficient; it cannot yet be subdued."*

*"The two return to challenge it"*—
The fire’s power advances once more.

The **Taoist** crone addressed the Great Sage:
*"The Great Sage of Heavenly Contention, born from the primordial unity of the Hunyuan Dao,
Refined in the Eight Trigram Furnace as the Golden Elixir Immortal,
Now submits to the Buddhist teaching.
Oh Great King, henceforth do not battle with him again!"*

She extolled the Great Sage’s origins,
Revealing that his elixir was forged from the **Hunyuan Dao**—
The **Hunyuan Dao** being the unity of **qi**,
Refined in the Eight Trigram Furnace.
When the fire’s power was perfected,
He must retreat and guard himself,
Waiting for the moment of **Dao**’s completion and transcendence.

This is as the **Cui Gong**’s *"Mirror of Entering the Medicine"* says:
*"Receive **qi** auspiciously, guard against perilous omens;
When the fire’s intensity is complete, do not harm the elixir;
Heaven and Earth’s essence refined—transformation is parsimonious."*

Thus the subsequent verses of the demon:
*"My noble sister’s vision is profound—
Tightly bar the gates!"*
*"Let any who call outside remain—
The gates shall never open!"*

The Pilgrim said:
*"You two must patrol the riverbank,
Lest he escape!"*
All were tactics of halting refinement and fortifying defenses,
Guarding against dangers and calamities,
Fearful of the *"midnight storm and thunder"* disaster.

**Danyang** Master spoke:
*"Fire in water rises, yet the mind must not be stirred;
Flowers bloom in snow—let the will extinguish the spring."*
This was when the monster had fortified its ramparts in layers,
Sealing the gates and refusing to emerge.
The **Dao**’s nature returns to its true essence—
A spontaneous, wondrous stillness.
The **Bodhisattva** of **Potalaka** moves with effortless grace—
Not awaiting the Pilgrim’s obeisance,
*"No one is permitted to attend—
She enters the bamboo grove to observe and play."*

Had the **Bodhisattva** known the demon would be subdued,
She would have prepared the instruments of capture beforehand,
To display their marvelous efficacy in **shen guan** [神观, divine observation].
This is not something to be shared with all.

The Great Sage then:
*"Let me sit for a moment,
Awaiting the Bodhisattva’s emergence."*
Since the time was not yet ripe,
He must patiently wait—
No need to agitate his restless mind.

When the **Red Boy** laughed:
*"In those days, your demonic passions clouded your heart,
But today you have attained the fruit of enlightenment—
Only now do you recognize my true goodness."*

This clearly marks the moment when the **Red Boy** revealed his true form.
Today’s demons, like the **Red Boy**,
Cannot achieve enlightenment without the **Bodhisattva**’s **Dao**-power and divine skill.
Though the principle of **Dao** is one—
To transcend the self and attain liberation—
The timing of their subjugation varies.

The Pilgrim’s heart burned with anxiety,
Fearful that delay would endanger his master’s life.
Yet time passed, and the elixir escaped its vessel—
His life was lost.

*"The Bodhisattva instructed,
‘Wait only for his own emergence.’"*
This refers to the elixir’s moment of **tui tai** [脱胎, transformation],
When it must be allowed to rise naturally.

Describing the **Bodhisattva**’s divine play in the bamboo grove—
All was effortless, unforced grace,
No artifice or pretense,
Revealing both male and female in one form,
Distinguishing purity from defilement.
Amidst the haste, she moved with perfect ease—
Within **zuo wang** [坐忘, seated oblivion], all was order.
The instruments of **shen guan** were truly profound,
As the **Ganlu** [甘露, sweet dew] of compassion fell upon the azure void.

Ah! How wondrous!

The River of Heaven’s demon’s root—
Only the Bodhisattva perceives its source;
In the bamboo grove, she strips the wicker—
What could the celestial hosts ever know?

To restore her household, few things she needs—
A single hand lifts a purple bamboo basket;
To rescue Tang Seng, time must not be lost—
No fetters bind the one who robes and sits.

Unadorned, the Bodhisattva appears,
Yet like a midwife pressed by urgent birth;
The basket tied at the stream’s head,
Plainly the fisherman against the current’s pull.

The Bodhisattva chants:
*"The dead depart, the living abide!
The dead depart, the living abide!"*
Divine! Divine!
The mechanism of life and death lies in her grasp—
Her secret technique, passed only by word of mouth,
Its wondrous inversion beyond speech.
Yet in shallow terms:
*"Abide"*—the essence of humanity,
Where heart-sprout and kidney-qi entwine,
Thus life is formed; entering my *"Gate"* is *"obstruction."*
*"Depart"*—the loss of unity,
Where the Seven Emotions and malevolent intent persist,
Thus death is sealed; when the *"ruin"* comes, it must *"perish."*

The living—this is *shen* [神, spirit],
Qi refined, ascending and abiding,
One’s attainment yields perfection,
Detached from humanity, self-sustaining—
Its abiding is its own, not the Bodhisattva’s.

The dead—this is *wu* [物, matter],
Substance impure, descending and departing,
Touch water, it breaks the law;
Meet the blade, it meets its fate—
Its departure is its own, not the Bodhisattva’s.

The *Sutra* says:
*"The Bodhisattva, in the Dharma, should dwell nowhere."*
Yet now it says *"abide"*—
Life arises from the living,
The living is without abiding, yet abiding arises from the living.
Departure stems from death,
Death is abiding itself—
Thus abiding leads to departure.
The chant’s manifest meaning is clear,
But its hidden marvels cannot be put to paper.

*"A radiant golden fish"*—
Suddenly enters the basket,
Only the Bodhisattva’s divine perception could mark its moment.

What intent does the Bodhisattva hold?
Tracing its origin, born from the lotus, unstained;
Examining her method, from the Nine Transformations, returning to One.

The *"tides surging from the sea"*—
Revealing the cause and conditions of its descent into the world as a spirit;

*"Counting the fingers, tracing the lines"*—
Calculating the time of its return to the origin.

*"Performing divine arts, weaving a bamboo basket, capturing the marvelous manifestation"*—
To show the common folk the vast compassion and great mercy—
For the divine response is such that the King is indeed the embodiment of a Great Sage.

As the *Sutra* states:
*"Guanyin Bodhisattva accomplishes such virtues,
Taking countless forms to traverse the lands,
Rescuing and liberating all beings."*

The Great Sage obtained the Dragon Girl and the Red Boy,
Revealing the true source of inherent nature;
The King obtained the boy and girl,
Manifesting the roots of life itself.

One and two are the same.

The people of Chenjiazhuang who hold faith—
Each household has its own divine-response Great Sage,
And the wondrous forms of the fish basket
Naturally possess the methods to subdue the divine-response King.
Yet why do they not revere and honor them with faith?

When the King is captured in the basket,
Tang Seng’s life is already saved,
The old turtle returns to its original abode and returns to the origin—
This is the completion of the Heavenly Passage and the Universal Salvation Boat.
Why bother with building ships or preparing oars?

*"Suddenly a loud cry from the river"*—
From *"knowing enlightenment is inherently divine,"*
*"It is truly real—*
*How dare it be false?"*

Crossing with a steady heart over ice thicker than layers—
*"A slight tilt, and the fruit of enlightenment is lost";*
Stepping on the lid, standing firm on either side—
Leading the horse upward, it is indeed the *River Diagram*.

Ah!

The turtle’s back emits a five-colored radiant light;
Within the Heavenly Passage, all mysteries of the formless are spoken.

Returning to the origin, it relies entirely on spontaneity;
Shedding its shell to become true, one must inquire of the Buddha and Ancestors.

Able to board the bottomless ship—
For here lies the root of divine essence planted.
Obtaining the scripture of written truth,
One must still traverse the *River Diagram*’s path.

Solemnly sworn to Heaven, not a word amiss—
I ask, I ask, do not forget.

**Fifty-First Chapter**
*Emotions Stirred by Lust, Nature Lost to Desire*
*The Godhead Dimmed, the Heart Bewildered by Demons*

Master Yu-yi of Enlightenment says: *The Journey to the West* expounds the Dao of the Golden Elixir, focusing solely on the two characters **"性" (nature/essence)** and **"命" (life/principle)**, which are in truth the original, true *qi* of the primal heavens.

Those who cultivate nature and life cultivate this single *qi*; when nature and life are both perfected, they return to unity.
Revolving endlessly, transforming in myriad ways, yet never departing from their source.

Various treatises establish doctrines:
Some first clarify nature, then life;
Others first clarify life, then nature.
Some say clarifying nature is the same as clarifying life,
Or that clarifying life is the same as clarifying nature.
Some emphasize nature alone, yet life holds no separate principle;
Others emphasize life alone, yet nature shares the same origin.
Some clarify nature but fail to grasp life’s subtlety,
Or clarify life but miss nature’s essence.
Some first grasp life, then later grasp nature,
Or first grasp nature, then later grasp life.
Some, failing to grasp nature, fall into emptiness and deceit,
Or, failing to grasp life, stray into demonic delusion.
Some, through false paths, fail to grasp life and lose their nature;
Others, through barren stillness, fail to grasp nature and cannot grasp life.
Some, led astray by material desires, fail to grasp nature;
Others, misled by illusions, fail to grasp life.
Some, not fully knowing nature’s beginning, cannot grasp it;
Others, not fully knowing life’s mysteries, cannot grasp it.

Some speak directly, some speak in reverse,
Some convey meaning through metaphor, some through symbols.
Some jest or indulge in idle musings to reveal inherent truth;
Others use cold, subtle words to demonstrate foundational practice.
Some hint at the essential keys,
Others openly reveal the true transmission.

Whether oblique or direct, indirect or allegorical.

The myriad demons may wield strange arts,
Yet all still revolve around refining **"性命"** (nature and life),
Or cultivating the **先天真乙之氣** (primal Daoist *qi* of the original Yang).

The first seven chapters follow a natural order.
Later ones, either ordered or without sequence,
Are inverted and rearranged—each chapter holds profound meaning.
Like the **造化** (Cosmic Transformation) carving all things,
No repetition exists; all ultimately stem from the **一元** (monarchal unity).

The *Paramartha Contract* says: *"孔窍其門"* (its gate is narrow and secret).
Ziyu Master says: *"引而不發"* (draw but do not release).
Only those who read well can **神觀默察** (divinely perceive and silently observe)
And thereby attain self-realization.

If a chapter’s teaching shifts with circumstance,
Unable to **安身立命** (settle oneself and establish one’s nature),
Then it is the *Yijing*’s *"思出其位"* (thinking beyond one’s station),
And the *Zhongyong*’s *"不能素位而願外"* (unable to abide in one’s inherent station yet craving the external).
All stems from **操守不固** (unstable moral discipline)
And **工夫未到** (unfulfilled practice).

The opening lines of *"Nán Kē Zǐ"* (The Southern Slope’s Child) reveal
A **心地工夫** (heart-mind cultivation) that is continuous and unbroken,
Every word piercing to the core.
Why single out *"南柯"* (Southern Slope)?
Because the world’s treacherous paths are **幻如南柯** (illusions like the Southern Slope).
If one’s heart clings to desires,
Unable to **隨遇而安** (adapt with equanimity),
Flitting from one place to another,
Then it is akin to being caught in a *Nán Kē* dream.

What is hardest for mortals to endure?
Nothing surpasses **饥欲** (hunger and craving),
And what most easily disturbs them?
**饥寒而思衣食** (hunger and cold, pondering food and garments).
In the text, the master and disciple share harmony of heart and unity of intent,
Pursuing truth and returning to the right path—
Thus refining nature and life.

Should hunger or cold arise,
One must **固穷** (embrace poverty with resolve),
Not recklessly act.
The Three Treasures (三藏) see the **楼台** (palatial halls) and desire to take alms,
The practitioner gazes at the **气色** (aura) and urges them not to enter,
Conveying the warning:
*"Do not knock at the gates of the mighty for gain,"*
*"Beware the ice-slick slopes and tread with caution."*
*"Dismount, sit level on the ground,
Do not stir your body.
Grant you a method to settle—
Draw a circle, charge you not to step beyond,
And steadfastly remain within.
This is **素位而行** (to move from one’s inherent station),
Not craving the external.
This is called **有坐性** (having settled nature),
Not merely tracing a circle like the *Yùzhàng Shù* (Jade Canopy Technique).

Having settled nature or lacking it—
Not in the sitting, but in the station.
To move from one’s inherent station is **有坐性** (having settled nature),
Not straying outside the circle.
Once one craves the external,
The settled station is lost—
Though one sits the whole day in stupor,
It is still **無坐性** (lacking settled nature),
Having stepped beyond the circle.

To dwell in wealth as though it were none—**有坐性**.
To endure poverty as though it were fixed—**有坐性**.
To face calamity as though it were trivial—**有坐性**.
To meet circumstances with ease,
Content and unperturbed,
Even without sitting, one sits.
Yet if the mind is restless,
Turned by external influences,
Then one has **性** (nature) and lacks **性** (nature).

To step outside this circle
Is to enter another—
As if trapped in the **罟獲陷阱** (nets and snares),
Yet unaware of how to avoid them.

Master and disciple both sit composed,
The practitioner does not shun a thousand *li* journey,
Serving the master with alms—
This is duty within the circle,
Not craving the external.
*"Until ancient trees rise to the heavens,
A village of dwellings is reached."*

The gate of brushwood creaked as an elder emerged, dragging a staff of *lú* (藜) and gazing upward to the heavens, proclaiming:
**"The northwest wind rises—tomorrow shall be clear!"**

A scruffy hound dashed forth from behind him.

Then he spoke again:
**"You’ve strayed from the path.
The Western Heaven’s way lies straight north ahead."**

But in his heart, fear struck him:
**"This monk is a ghost! A ghost!"**

Then he raised his staff to strike, and the Wayfarer replied:
**"Old one, no matter how you strike,
Just remember the tally of your blows—
One staff for one *shēng* (升) of rice,
Slowly measured out."**

Hearing this, the elder slammed the gate shut,
Shouting only: **"There’s a ghost! A ghost!"**

The Wayfarer said:
**"The Dao transforms the virtuous, and the virtuous release the foolish."**

With a hidden-body technique, he took a bowl of dry rice and returned.

Ah! How wondrous!
The Immortal Master’s parable is profound and veiled—
Unfathomable to the reader.
Common folk might think it merely depicts
A barking village dog and a miserly old man,
But who would know it’s a covert censure
Of those in high station who secretly hoard wealth,
Pretending to discern the *tian shi* (天时) and perceive human affairs,
Relying on their power to gauge the winds of fortune—
Truly, they are men of **shàng kuì fǔ zuò** (仰愧俯怍),
Who have stepped beyond the circle of **tian zuòxìng** (天坐性),
Likely akin to the *Mǎng Dàfū* (莽大夫) of the *Gāng Mù Shū* (纲目书).

How do we see this?
**"Ancient trees reaching to the heavens"**—
Is this not dwelling in the *Mù Tiān* (木天, the realm of wood)?
**"Dragging a staff of *lú* (藜)"**—
Is this not the *Tài Yǐ Zhàng* (太乙杖, the staff of the Supreme Unity), a *lú* staff?
**"Village dwellings and brushwood gates"**—
Is this not wandering in the wilds?
**"Gazing to the heavens and spotting a scruffy hound"**—
Is this not observing the winds while clinging to survival,
And feeling shame before the heavens?

**"You’ve strayed from the path—
The Western Heaven’s way lies straight north ahead."**
Not knowing his own error in facing south,
Yet instructing others of their westward deviation—
His heart is filled with shame,
Hence he cries: **"A ghost! A ghost!"**
If his mind clings to ghosts,
Is this not shame before humanity?

**"The elder raises his staff to strike.
The Wayfarer says: ‘Old one,
Just remember the tally of your blows—
One staff for one *shēng* (升) of rice.’"**
Indeed, he relies only on records to predict promotions,
Knowing nothing beyond his own stolen gains and self-satisfied sustenance—
His heart is filled with shame,
Hence he cries: **"A ghost! A ghost!"**
When he reflects on his deeds,
How could he not shame himself to death?

The Eight Precepts say:
**"I am not like that uncouth man,"**
And thus marks his own kind.

This man is neither virtuous nor foolish—
The Dao cannot transform him,
And the teachings cannot release him.

Such wretched souls—ashamed above, abashed below—
Though they hold office yet step beyond their station,
Their words betray their hearts, their deeds betray their speech,
Clear villains indeed! Better far were those who hide their faces,
Scratching for scraps to feed their parents, serve their masters,
Yet show the utmost reverence and respect.

The Sage’s words are not idle—
He stirs the spirit of loyal ministers,
Sets a warning for all who bear office,
Just as Mencius’ parable of the Qi man:
The wise man knows his own worth,
The fool knows his own folly—
Thus the noble refuse the taste of others’ fat and grain.

Tang Seng, bewildered by the fool’s tale of prison,
All left their circle together,
Sitting at the gates of princes and nobles,
Silent as a ghost’s lair, with no trace of man—
Not that there were none, but only beggars in the dead of night,
Living like ghosts in a tomb.

The fool entered and saw:
Silken curtains, ivory beds—
A heap of white bones, gaunt and shriveled.
To see one of noble rank yet neglect his nature and life—
The clear-eyed see only a pile of bones.

The fool wept and sighed:
*"Where now are the heroes and the bold?"*
A saying to stir the soul to wakefulness.

*"A flicker of lamplight in the tent"*—
The fleeting nature of life, like a spark soon gone.
*"Silken robes on the table"*—
The allure of purple and gold.
*"No matter right or wrong, he takes off his robe"*—
The shamelessness of office.
*"No one around—who could know?"*—
The fearlessness of the four watchful senses.
*"He stands unsteady, then crashes to the ground"*—
The fickleness of honor and disgrace.
*"He binds his own hands behind his back"*—
The ease with which one falls into the law’s snare.

Tang Seng, driven by hunger, left the circle and roused the demon.
The fool, clinging to warmth, fell into its trap—
All because desire clouded their nature, their passions unchecked,
Their ruin self-wrought. What blame to the demon?

Thus those who cultivate the Dao’s natural worth
Refuse the trappings of rank and finery.

The Pilgrim returned to the circle for food,
Found no one, no horses—
Looked back, and the towers had turned to jagged rocks.
The yellow millet still unripe, all changed in an instant—
The sea becomes land, land becomes sea—
Truly worthy of lament and song!

All because they could not steadfastly preserve their nature,
Dared to leave the circle, greedy for warmth and ease—
How could they not stray from the path,
Stumble into the jaws of demons?

The old man pointed to *"The Golden Cangshan Cave, where the One-Horned Rhinoceros King reigns."*
The *cang* is a helmet, armor for battle.
The rhinoceros with a single horn is *kàng*—
The king with a single horn is *zhǔ*—
One who steps beyond his station, restless and defiant,
A rebel lord, like the ancient *Huandou* of old.

Thus the tale begins with the master and disciples on their proper path,
Then suddenly a great mountain appears,
Its peaks towering, its ridges sharp—
San Zang holds the reins tight.

The lofty peaks contrast with the towering mountain,
The *cang* (helmet) echoes *Huandou*’s defiance.
Now the *"Cang"* character appears—
Hiding *Huandou* within the mountain’s grandeur.

*Huandou* aided *Gonggong* in rebellion,
Ravaging the age of sage rule—
The ultimate rebel, the most transgressive.
The Sage likens the demon to this ancient traitor.

The old man revealed himself as mountain god and earth spirit,
Accepted the alms bowl,
*"Wait until I rescue Tang Seng,
Then I will serve Tang Seng—
To show the Great Sage’s utmost reverence and filial piety."*
The mountain god does not overstep, does not accept improperly,
Proving the Great Sage’s respect is his due.

The Great Sage searched for the demon’s lair to battle,
The demon, hearing this, rejoiced:
*"Since leaving my palace,
I have not yet tested my skills."*

His joy was seized—
The *cang* (helmet) of defiance, restless and impulsive—
Not to be overcome by mere movement.

The Pilgrim, unable to win, grew frantic,
Lifted his *Jin’gu* Staff and split it into thousands of strands—
Thus, movement only fuels more movement,
And the more he stirs, the deeper he falls.

The demon’s trap was set by movement itself—
The old demon took the circle and bound the *Jin’gu* Staff,
All reduced to motion.

But motion cannot be contained—
All because the first impulse came from within.

Thus it is said:
*"Dao rises one foot, yet the measure stretches ten—
Nature disordered, passions clouded, home misjudged.
Alas, the Dharma-body has no seat—
At that moment, the moving thought was wrong."*

The Fifth Volume:
*The Monkey King’s Empty Schemes*
*Fire and Water Fail to Forge the Demon*

Master Wu Yi said: The rhinoceros is *chǒu*—
Earth of the ugly trigrams, in man it is *yì* (intent).
When intent runs wild with no restraint,
The heart follows, turning with no master—
Losing its grip, it forgets the principle,
And the *Jin’gu* Staff is bound away.

*"The Great Sage stood empty-handed, weeping:
‘Who would have thought my staff was lost?’"*
Meaning he had lost his resolve.

Man can master intent to overcome Heaven,
But Heaven cannot force intent upon man.
If intent is clouded by things and one falls into misfortune,
Yet knows not to reflect—
Only piously pleading to Heaven,
Like a guilty minister who has lost his way.

Without the staff to wield,
He only polishes his words and feigns respect,
Hoping the ruler will listen—
Though he trembles and grovels, bowing deeply,
Exhausting all artifice—
What good does it do?
It only deepens his delusion.

The Great Sage’s petition to Heaven—
A portrait of the deceitful minister—
How could the ruler take such a heart,
And make it sincere?

The Jade Emperor’s edict:
Let Han Xiang go with the Great Sage to investigate.
*The Zhou Ben Ji* names the Han clan as descendants of He.
*Han* is *He*—
Meaning *"how"*—
As in *"how shall we consult this?"*

Thus, upon close investigation, even the Five Emperors could not intervene, so the Monkey was ordered to select celestial generals. The Celestial Master, Xu Jingyang, merely said, *"Let him choose the generals according to his judgment."* Having selected the Li Heavenly King and his sons, as well as the Thunder Lord, the Jade Emperor granted his request—neither the Heavenly Belt nor the Celestial Master could oppose it.

When the Prince Nezha unleashed his magic, his transformations were boundless; when the Demon King hurled his ring into the sky, it ensnared the Six Divine Weapons. The Deng and Zhang lords dared not strike with thunder, and the Heavenly King exclaimed, *"How can this be resolved?"*—even the heavenly deities could not intervene.

They then summoned the Fire Deity of Vermilion Splendor to unleash flames, only to have the fire dragons themselves ensnared; next, they called upon the Water Deity of Wuhao Palace to flood the battlefield, but the waters surged outward uncontrollably. Even these lifeless yet tangible forces—fire and water—could not subdue him.

Finally, the Monkey transformed his own hairs into tiny monkeys, only to have them trapped as well. Resuming his true form, he realized that distant measures were futile and began to consider the principle of *"near-taking from within."* Yet how could he hope to restrain one so reckless when his efforts were confined to mere skin and hair?

The assembled gods deliberated:

The Demon King is easy to subdue—only the child’s nature is difficult to conquer.
Unless the treasure is obtained, the demon cannot be captured afterward.

For the strategy to subdue the demon, nothing surpasses first seizing what the demon relies upon;
To seize what the demon relies upon, nothing surpasses first mastering what one oneself employs.

Thus, Deng and Zhang the Two Masters said: *"If one must practice the art of stealth, none but the Great Sage can do it."*
Stealth means subtle transformation and silent operation.
To act with virtue is within oneself, not dependent on others;
Only by inwardly reflecting and rigorously self-examining,
Silently transforming within the heart,
Can one suddenly reclaim what was lost—
Not by mere theft of peaches or elixirs,
Nor by superficially grasping it as a skill.

Thus, the Pilgrim stole into the demon’s cave
And suddenly saw the Golden-Hooped Rod—
This was a fleeting enlightenment,
Yet the master of the staff returned to its rightful owner.
But it was not guaranteed he would not lose it again,
For seizing it through theft was but a glimmer in a crack,
Unable to perceive the whole,
And thus ultimately could not escape its bonds.

Earth resides in the central palace,
While Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire encircle it in function;
Distributed to the four corners,
Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire encircle it in form.
Departing from its proper office and achieving one-sided dominance—
If Earth accumulates and buries Metal,
Then the Golden-Hooped Rod is ensnared;
If Earth obstructs and Water is blocked,
Then Water’s force cannot break free from the bonds.

Earth, as the proper principle, is most divine;
Earth, as perverse, is also most divine.
This vile Earth steals its circle to ensnare all things.

Thus, when the spleen fails, danger is near;
When intent is corrupt, affairs fall into chaos.
Those skilled in distinguishing yellow (Earth) must regulate the spleen;
Those skilled in nurturing life must first subdue the intent.
For intent can harm the heart and disrupt the Five Virtues,
Just as Earth can harm nature and disrupt the Five Phases.

To tame the Earthly intent,
No amount of deliberation, strategy, coercion, or force can succeed—
This is why the heavenly deities, Thunder Lord, Fire Deity, and Water God were ineffective.

Thus, the precept states:
*"The mind-monkey, though plotting a thousand schemes,
Finds water and fire useless in refining the demon."*

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
*The Great Sage Raises Havoc in the Golden-Hooped Left "Mountain" Right "Pouch" Cave*
*The Buddha subtly instructs the protagonist:*
*"The Sage said to the Awakened One:*
*The Venerable Huiyan Zen Master replied:*
*'There is something prior to Heaven and Earth,
Formless, originally still and empty.'"*

The mind-monkey, though plotting a thousand schemes,
Finds water and fire useless in refining the demon.

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
*The Great Sage Raises Havoc in the Golden-Hooped Left "Mountain" Right "Pouch" Cave*
*The Buddha subtly instructs the protagonist:*

*"The Awakened One said:
The Venerable Huiyan Zen Master replied:
'There is something prior to Heaven and Earth,
Formless, originally still and empty—
It can govern all phenomena,
Yet does not wither with the Four Seasons.'

This points to the luminous and unceasing clarity,
The true essence of Heaven’s nature, where form and breath are none.
The Buddha’s teaching here is precisely this.

He who knows the **principal** [主] of intent dwells in the void,
He who comprehends the **principal** of intent abides in seated illumination.
Only when the protagonist is **obtained** can the Earthly intent be steadied;
Only when the protagonist is **known** can the **principal** be **obtained**.

If one relies on the power of transient perceptions and worldly wisdom,
Yet seeks to pacify emotions and still intent—
This is like summoning the heavenly deities, Thunder Lord, Fire Deity, and Water God,
Only to remain trapped in their schemes.

Even if one gains a fleeting glimpse of insight,
Suddenly recalling the old self—
It is but like a thief raiding a camp or plundering a fortress,
A mere skirmish of scattered troops and clever tactics.

*'The Pilgrim stole the Golden-Hooped Rod.
Then he tried to steal its binding circle,
Like a pickpocket’s trade—
Seeing the circle but not knowing what it was,
He couldn’t touch it.
Only the fire-arm glowed brightly,
Like daylight itself,
And when he saw all the traps and weapons vanish,
He rejoiced and rode the dragon back in flames.'*

This is the fleeting glimpse of insight,
The sudden recall of the old self—
So-called chasing the superficial while losing the root,
Gaining only to lose again—
How could they walk the path,
When Eight Rules, Sha Monk, and the Elder still held him bound,
And the White Horse with its baggage remained in the house?

Thus, the old sage scolded the Daoist path:
*'O thief-monkey!*'

The old demon scoffed, *"You waste your contrivances—you know nothing of my true power!"*
Indeed, he did not know the root.

All the gods, thinking themselves triumphant,
Rallied again for battle.
*"The gods remain bare-handed,
The Great Sage still fights empty-handed."*

What use is the brilliance of fire
To pierce the darkness of the boundless sky?
With nothing to grasp or exert,
How could they counter the phantom stirrings of the earth?

Thus the old demon cried, *"My children, move the earth and build!"*
Plotting to *"slay the Tang Monk and his three disciples to repay the earth,
So all may scatter blessings and enjoy their rewards."*
Earth’s movement harms essence and life—
The words made it plain.

*"Fire’s virtue resents its haste,
Thunder’s lord blames his impatience,
The Water Spirit falls silent in frustration."*
All were sharp-witted, yet recalled treacherous schemes,
Their discord and imbalance now evident.

How else could one discern this
Unless the Tathāgata’s wisdom-eye observed?

The Tathāgata—
Neither from nor to anywhere,
The very *"Heaven’s unalterable nature"*—
Is the *"Thus-Come-One"* who neither gains nor loses.

The *"wisdom-eye"*—
The innate luminous clarity of true nature,
Returning to self-illumination,
Transparent within and without,
Not a hair’s breadth obscured,
Neither clinging nor resisting,
Naturally pure and still—
Like a mirror’s calm water.

The Pilgrim arrived at the Sacred Summit,
Surveying the four directions,
When suddenly a voice called out:
*"Sun Wukong, where have you come from?"*

Not truly arriving at the Sacred Summit—
The *"Sacred Platform"* of the heart-mind is the place itself.
Awakening suddenly to the Tathāgata’s realm,
He replied: *"I have just arrived at this noble land."*

The Tathāgata asked: *"How did you come here alone?"*
A place unknown to others,
Yet known only to oneself.

The Tathāgata had long since perceived it through his wisdom-eye,
And already knew—
*"Though I know of that fiend,
I must not reveal it."*

This thing must be self-realized;
Words cannot convey it—
*"That which cannot be spoken is called speech."*

Again, the Tathāgata said:
*"I shall lend you my magical power."*

The Pilgrim asked: *"What power does the Tathāgata lend me?"*
The Tathāgata then commanded the Eighteen Arhats
To open the treasure vault
And take eighteen grains of *jīndānshā* (gold elixir sand).
Each took one grain,
And gave it to Wukong to aid his strength.
Thus trapped, the fiend could not move his body,
Nor lift his feet.

Marvelous!
*"Eighteen"*—the number of *"wood,"*
Which, if taken literally, suggests wood subdues earth as aid—
Yet this is mere empty reasoning.
Where could one exert effort?

Eighteen grains of *jīndānshā*,
Taken by the Eighteen Arhats—
Each took one grain.
*"Eighteen"* plus *"each"* becomes *"gé"* (格),
Meaning *"to restrain"*—
Only by restraining it can one seize it,
As in *"opening the golden treasure vault,
Each takes what they recognize."*

Thus, to cultivate sincerity,
One must first attain knowledge,
And knowledge lies in investigating things.

The character *"wù"* (物) bears the radical *"niú"* (牛).
The *Shuōwén* says:
*"The ox is the great thing.
The cycles of Heaven and Earth begin with the Ox."*
Heaven and Earth rely on the Ox to complete their revolutions;
Humanity relies on sincerity to harmonize the center.

Yet why did the eighteen grains of *jīndānshā* vanish?
*"Jīndān"* called *"shā"* (sand)—
The outer husk of the golden elixir.
The sage deliberately turned the phrase,
Lest scholars mistake *"investigating things"* for mere *"collecting things,"*
And fail to grasp the essence of investigation.
Only when knowledge is complete
Can one truly investigate.

If one merely examines things without true knowing,
Even if they exhaust all books from the age of Xuanyuan onward,
Memorizing every classification,
Or investigate all things within the cosmos—
Encompassing all plants and creatures—
It is still distant, superficial pursuit,
Chasing externals and losing the vital core,
Unrelated to life and essence.

*"Laughing at past delusions,
Seeking branches and leaves beyond."*

How could this be,
When the Arhats stood empty-handed in the clouds?
Names alone filled their minds,
Yet their hands were truly empty—
Where was the restraining?

Only when knowledge is complete
Can one truly investigate.
Selecting the good,
Then investigating thoroughly;
Only when precise,
Can knowledge be complete.

「To select the good and clarify principles,
To refine precision and grasp the central truth,
Only then can one subdue this creature without difficulty.

The Buddha’s command to the two revered beings—**Subduing Dragon** and **Taming Tiger**—who lingered behind:
*"The two revered beings said to the Pilgrim: ‘O **Sun Wukong**, do you know why we two are slow to depart?’*
*The Pilgrim replied: ‘I do not.’"*

Only when one understands the essential subtleties of **Subduing Dragon** and **Taming Tiger**,
Can one fully grasp and know them to their depths.

The **Arhats** explained:
*"The Buddha commanded: ‘Having lost the **Golden Elixir Cinder** (金丹砂),
Let **Sun Wukong** ascend to **Laozi’s** **Highest Primordial Heaven** (離很天太上老君處) to seek its traces.’"*

**Laozi** embodies the **Li** (☉) hexagram’s fifth line—
Five hollows within yet capable of containing all things,
Thus able to **calm the mind** and remain unmoving.

The **Golden Elixir Cinder** (金刚琢) is the **Li** (☉) hexagram’s **yellow ear** (黄耳),
Firm yet yielding, golden yet with jade-like purity,
Unchanging from beginning to end,
Thus able to **encompass all things** without leaving any trace.

In the sixth chapter, this treasure was used
And struck the **Great Sage** (大聖) at that moment—
Its meaning has been fully expounded.

This reveals why **Laozi** lost his **central void** (中),
Not because the **Golden Elixir Cinder** was truly lost from his **hollow core** (虚中),
But due to the **boy’s** ignorance and confusion,
Which stirred the **earthly passions** (意土) into chaos.

It is clear that the **human heart** (人心) possesses an **awakened child** (灵童),
Yet when obscured by ignorance, it fails to recognize,
Thus acting blindly and recklessly,
Creating mischief and havoc,
Endangering one’s **life and essence** (性命).

With a **transformative vessel** (化质之器具) turned against the **sage’s head** (圣魔头),
This is all because of the **unrestrained movement** (纵放出入) of this very thing.

The key to **subduing and returning** lies in
One’s own **secret discernment** (密察),
Not in reliance upon others.

*"The Pilgrim’s eyes did not waver,
Gazing east and west—"*
A **divine observation** (神观).

*"Suddenly seeing the boy dozing,
The ox nowhere in sight,
He cried: ‘Master, the ox is gone!
The ox is gone!’"*
Now tracking the **footprints of the culprit** (脚色),
True knowing and clear vision.

*"The boy awoke with a start,"*
As if emerging from a dream.

*"It has now been seven days,"*
The time of **seven-day return** (七日来复),
When **Heaven’s will** (天心) is restored.

Only upon uncovering the **stolen Golden Elixir Cinder** (偷去金刚琢),
Does one achieve **full mastery of things** and **complete knowing** (物格而知至).

**"Laozi brandished his banana leaf fan,"**
Holding the **pure and empty qi** (清虚之气),
To restore the **central void** (虚中之物),
Thus embodying the principle of **"grasping the center while preserving sincerity"** (执中存诚).

**"He shouted: ‘Ox! Why do you not return home?’"**

That demon instantly recognized the protagonist—
with one wave of the fan, the illusionary circle was cast aside;
with a second, the original form was revealed.
As the saying goes:
*"A single call awakens the enlightened child,
Two breaths restore the true form to the Supreme Clarity."*

*"Laozi mounted the ox and ascended to Heaven,
The assembled deities took up their arms and departed,
Master and disciple prepared their gear to leave the cave."*

The meaning is settled, the heart at peace—
all thanks to the Buddha’s wisdom eye revealing the truth.
Those who seek the Dao each possess the Buddha’s wisdom eye—
yet why do they alone fail to recognize the protagonist within?

The passage where Laozi says,
*"Seven returns of the Fire Elixir—
one grain consumed, seven days of slumber ensue,"*
holds a deeper truth.
*"Seven returns"* is the refined divine fire—
after ingestion, the bones grow numb, the sinews languid,
a natural seven-day repose,
which is in truth a great awakening, not a great sleep.

The immortal teacher deliberately lingered at the drowsy ox-tending spot,
revealing the secret in idle conversation.

The marvels of the Returned Elixir have already been fully disclosed in prior sections—
now let the discerning examine them closely.

**Fifty-third Chapter**
*The Spirit Lord Swallows the Meal and Conceives a Ghost-Born Babe*
*The Yellow Nurse Draws Water to Dissolve the Demon Womb*

A sage once said:
*"The disciple honors the master—
though taking what was not his own,
he retains a kernel of reverent filial devotion."*

The earthly deity’s words
seem to condemn him as directly defiled.

The thief takes his spoils and barely endures,
the monkey wears silk while sporting a ragged crown—
plainly, they are but kindling for a gate,
a dog barking at the golden **box** (*left "mountain," right "trap"*),
their bones exposed beneath borrowed robes.

All act at whim, defying proper bounds,
utterly lacking the stillness of sitting.

Though luck may spare them, how can they avoid shameful death?

The Tripitaka Master said:
*"Had I known I’d not escape this circle,
I’d never have risked this peril to my life."*

The Pilgrim said:
*"All because you didn’t trust my circle,
yet forced me to endure another’s."*

For man’s circle or my circle—
both are one circle.

Two **"men"** in harmony form **"sitting"** (*土*), but when discord arises and they part from the earth,
then man is man, earth is earth—
no sitting-nature remains, and they step beyond the circle.

The dispute lies in a single thought:
the moment of separation or union,
where truth and falsehood are divided.

To step out or enter—
only self-awareness matters.

The Tathagata points to the root:
the path of insight into the sitting-nature’s separation and union,
the true **dharma** for abiding and establishing life.

Thus it is said:
*"Wash away thoughts and cleanse the heart to return to true awakening,
eat wind and drink dew as you journey westward."*

The above speaks of cultivating the nature’s root—
exhaustive and complete.

Yet the sages say that exhausting nature reaches life,
never speaking only of nature itself.

For when nature is exhausted, life attains its fullness—
life lies within the exhaustion of nature.

This is the sage’s unchanging, immutable **Dao**,
encompassing all under heaven and future generations,
so that the wise, the foolish, the virtuous, and the unworthy
may all bow and accept, or rise and reach it.

Thus, the sage rarely speaks of life,
for its principle is too subtle,
lest it arouse in people the fear of hidden, difficult-to-understand depths.

Only in the *Zhouyi*’s **Dao** of yin and yang’s harmonious exchange,
the subtleties of *Kan* and *Li*’s completion,
the mechanism of all things’ transformation and birth,
does he speak at length without tiring—
never cutting off people from their own ultimate attainment.

In the following three chapters,
the cultivation of life is clarified to perfect the holy embryo,
using the **pre-heaven** true **yi** (*乙*) within the **bing** water (*壬*) to achieve authenticity—
not by clinging to a single aspect to cultivate,
and thus forming the false image of solitary yin or solitary yang.

I have read *Waiji Zazhi*:
*"In the northeastern sea corner lies a land of women,
with no men.
Gazing into a well causes conception,
and they bear daughters."*

The text refers to it as the **"Western Liang"** Women’s Realm (*西梁女国*),*
pointing to that very place,
where it will metaphorically embody the image of a man’s body being pure and untainted by yang.

Zhongli Gong said:
*"Tears, saliva, seminal essence, qi, blood, and bodily fluids—
seven kinds of refined substances, all yin.
If one uses these to forge the elixir,
how can one ascend to the Jade Capital as a spirit?"*

For after a man’s body is broken,
his **pre-heaven** true yang is already lost—
not only is semen obstructed,
but his qi is also yin.

If one clings to cultivating life within a single body
and seeks to restore true yang,
then it is as the *Cansong Qi* says:
*"A hen broods an egg—
its chick will never be whole.
A woman marries a woman,
refining yin with yin.
Why then does she weave and spin?
Why then does she give birth and transform?"*

Cultivators of the elixir, reading the works of immortals and true sages,
encounter phrases like *"a man’s pregnancy is no different from a woman’s,"*
and thus mistakenly think to form an elixir embryo within themselves
by using their own seminal essence and blood,
as if performing the marvel of husband and wife within one’s own body.

Without a true master’s guidance,
misunderstanding the profound intent,
they become like the Tripitaka Master and the foolish monk,
drinking from the **Child-Mother River**,
conceiving a ghost-born babe,
and falling ill as a result.

The **Yellow Nurse** laughed heartily:
*"You’re drinking water from that river over there?
What a prank!"*

「Good joke! Such utter confusion truly deserves to be laughed out of court. The Nurse speaks of the **Child-Mother River**—

*"The Welcoming Yang Inn* and *Illuminating Embryo Spring*!"
She says the **Child-Mother River** flows with pure yin, merging with the Yang, yet never lingering as a station,
and that the *Illuminating Embryo Spring* yields only female offspring, never male—pure yin, no yang at all.

If one cultivates yin to form an embryo,
with a tangible body and distinct shape,
it is clearly a *"clot of blood, lump of flesh."*
*"How can a man’s body, lacking a birth passage,
ever extricate it?"*
Unless it is through the *"flawed side, where the child’s intestine is nurtured,
and the neck is mistaken for the embryonic womb—*
the *"Gentle Hands, Steady Nurse"*—
not knowing where to apply force,
fearing only to *"squeeze and rupture the sac,"*
and then needing medicine to abort the embryo.

Such cold, mocking actions,
everywhere sharp with hidden meaning,
are nothing but a farce—
a grotesque performance of reckless folly,
seeking death in life’s guise—
to ridicule the world’s blind stupidity.
Do not dismiss it as mere jest or idle play!

The Nurse points out:
*"To the true south lies the **Yang-Solving Mountain** and **Child-Splitting Cavern**,
where the Embryo Spring descends."*

Now, the **Child-Mother River**’s yin waters
that the Tripitaka Master and the foolish monk consumed
had not yet reached the *Welcoming Yang Inn*,
untainted by yang qi—
so they could say it *"dissolves yin,"*
but why call it *"Yang-Solving"*?

It is because this water,
which humans fail to grasp as true yang,
earns the name *"Yang-Solving"*—
a mountain that can dissolve the true essence of this yang water,
only then capable of shattering the false formations of yin waters.
It is not to be mistaken for *"breaking a yin embryo"* as *Yang-Solving*.

The true south is the position of the **Li** hexagram,
which clarifies the *Yang-Solving* principle.
The Spring is a well—
a well is the **Kan** hexagram.
Within *Kan* lies the **preheaven true yang**,
the **true yi water** of the **wang** cycle,
the place where *Kan* and *Li* interact in harmony,
where spinning and weaving reach their peak—
the waters surge, and true essence is born.

From the beginning of creation,
all things with form and substance
arise from and transform through this **true yi water** of the three elements and eight trigrams.

「Thus, the **Sage’s Fire** absorbs this **true yi water** into its belly,
illuminating my **true yin mercury**—
then all the **yin evils** within my body are utterly annihilated,
just as the *Treasure of Enlightenment* says:

*"In the pool’s red dawn, yin demons vanish."*

The meaning of **true yin** and **true yang** is made clear in one verse—
the enlightened shall understand it themselves.

This is called the **"As-You-Wish True Immortal"**—
*"renovating it into the Gathering of Immortals Hall,*
*guarding the Falling Path Well."*
If one attains this **true yi water** and cultivates the body,
nothing shall be unfulfilled.

It is where the **True Immortal’s Water** resides—
the place where **Immortal Qi** converges.
One cannot obtain it lightly—
how could it not be guarded?

Yet if one seeks **true yi water**,
one must spend wealth to acquire it.

If there is no wealth,
one can only endure fate.

The **Old Mother’s** words are each a guiding clue—
she truly has a **compassionate heart for saving the world**!

The **Practitioner**, upon hearing this,
rides the clouds to the mountain,
and sees the **Old Daoist** fully explain its significance.

But why does the **True Immortal** grow angry?
Because **true yi water**, when taken in accordance with the **Dao/Way**,
becomes the **human essence**—
when taken against it,
becomes the **essence of the Immortal**—
taking it in accord is easy,
taking it against is difficult.
Easy brings fulfillment,
difficult brings no fulfillment.

The **anger and conflict** here
symbolize the difficulty of taking it against the **Dao/Way**,
fulfilling one’s wish yet not attaining it.

Unable to fulfill one’s wish,
one cannot bear to abandon the **precious virtue** of the **Sage’s Fire**.

This is why the **Sage’s Fire** and **Precious Virtue** are suddenly raised—
to contrast and debate their merits.

Without the **Yellow Mother’s** mediation,
seeking aid in vain,
the matter would never be resolved.

The **Sand Monk**, of the **earth element**,
is the **Yellow Mother**.

*"The Practitioner directly returns to the village dwelling,*
*summons the Sand Monk to seize the opportunity and take the water.
The Monk retrieves his **precious technique**,
strikes down the Daoist, and takes the water away."*

This makes clear:
without the **Yellow Mother’s** **precious staff**,
one cannot obtain the water.

*"The Practitioner snatches the True Immortal’s As-You-Wish Hook"*
—**true yi** is now in hand.

*"He breaks it into two segments,*
*then splits one of those into four."*

The **Hook** is **yi**—
for **true yi** transforms into the **Two Principles (yin-yang)**,
and the **Two Principles** into the **Four Phases (four symbols)**.

The **True Immortal** is also called **Master**—
what he holds is the **Hook**,
what he guards is the **Water**,
concealing the meaning of **preheaven true yi water** of the **wang cycle**.

*"Laughing heartily, he rides the clouds and returns"*
—seeing that what was not wished for
was taken against the **Dao/Way**,
yet now attains fulfillment.

The verse’s meaning is profound.

If one refines **true yin lead** as **yang**,
one must use this **yang water** of **true yi**.
This **yang water** is the **true yin lead** itself,
hence the saying: *"True yin lead, when refined, requires true yang water."*

Obtaining this **yang water** of **true yi**
and blending it with my **true yin mercury**,
then my **mercury** shall dry naturally—
hence the saying: *"True yang water blends with true yin mercury, making it dry."*

Yet if **true yin mercury** and **true yin lead** do not harmonize,
their **Qi** cannot be attained—
they have **form and substance** yet lack **mother Qi**,
and cannot form the **Elixir**—
hence the saying: *"True yin mercury and true yin lead lack mother Qi."*

One must add **Soul Sand** and **Flying Ascension’s** **precious medicines**—
those with **Qi yet no substance**,
are true **Immortal Elixirs**—
hence the saying: *"Soul Sand and precious medicines are Immortal Elixirs."*

If one only cultivates within the body,
it is no more than **swallowing saliva** and **absorbing Qi**,
**consuming evil** and **feasting on fluids**—
even if a **fetal form** is created,
it is a **pure yin** malady—
hence the saying: *"The child’s fetal form is falsely structured."*

Only when the **Yellow Mother** blends **golden water**
and applies the **refining technique**,
does it become the **true wondrous Dao**—
hence the saying: *"The earthly mother applies the technique—this is no ordinary matter."*

Understanding this,
one shall *"overturn false sects, uphold the orthodox teaching,*
*the mind of the Sage rejoices, returning to delight."*

This water *"requires but a single sip,*
*to dissolve the fetal Qi."*

That is—
when **true yi Qi** enters the **crucible** and illuminates the **mercury**,
it dissolves the **false embryo**,
forming the **natural Immortal fetus**—
a marvel of **one action yielding two results**.

Those who **swallow yin** and **consume substances**,
are they not **self-inflicted sins through the mouth**?

Thus it concludes:
*"Washing away oral sins, the body becomes pure,*
*melting away mortal fetuses, the body transforms naturally."*

In the **fifty-fourth chapter**,
the **Old Mother** speaks of *"slicing flesh to make a fragrant pouch"*—
this warns that when taking the water,
great peril lies ahead,
as if entering a **tiger’s den** to seize its cub,
requiring utmost caution.
Yet she has already foreshadowed the **terrifying nature** of the **Female Realm**.

The **fifty-fourth chapter** states:
*"The Western Liang Female Realm—*
*the mind-monkey devises a plan to escape the illusory world."*

A blind teacher misleads others,
severing the **ultimate Dao**—
such contrivances
not only harm life
but also disrupt **dharma-nature**.

The **Immortal Master** uses the **Western Liang Female Realm** as an allegory.

The verse says:
*"Within the realm, pure yin lacks the least yang"*—
this cuts through the confusion clearly.

For **male and female** copulation,
all things transform and are born.

The **female** attains it as **human seed**,
the **male** attains it as **Immortal seed**.
Their copulation is fundamentally distinct—
**yang** and **yin** differ in direction.

The **Female Realm’s** elderly and young women
all clap joyfully in unison:
*"The human seed has arrived!*
*The human seed has arrived!"*

They rejoice at seeing the **male**—
yet this is merely to fulfill their desires,
and to fulfill them is to bring forth **human transformation** alone.

As for the **Welcome to Yang Station** and the **Fetal Spring**,
along the way,
all seen—
from noble to common, in attire—
are but depictions of **pure yin without yang**.

This makes clear:
the **Practitioner’s path** has not yet succeeded—
how could he become an **Immortal** or **Buddha**?

The **station magistrate** reports,
and the **Female Sovereign** is overjoyed,
saying:
*"Last night I dreamed of this—*
*today’s joy is a sign of good fortune!"*
She declares:
*"Since the time of **Chaos** and the **Opening of Creation**,
across generations of emperors,
no man has ever come to my realm."*

I vow to pair with him in yin-yang harmony,
to bear sons and grandsons,
and perpetuate the imperial lineage forever.

For since time immemorial to this day,
there has never been one who paired with a man in yin-yang harmony,
bearing sons and grandsons.

Now, to see a man and fulfill his desires—
this is a rare event since the Opening of Creation.

Yet just as there has never been, from time immemorial to this day,
one who paired with a woman in yin-yang harmony,
fulfilling her desires,
and thereby attained Immortality or Buddhahood—

So too, to see a woman and desire to pair with her,
fulfilling her desires,
is an event as rare as last night’s dream.

Thus, though one cannot attain Immortality or Buddhahood
without the Dao of human transformation,
it is not through carnal union to fulfill desire,
but through spiritual union to reverse its mechanism.

This is why the woman rejoices at seeing a man,
while the man laments seeing a woman—
lamenting that she can dissipate his true *qi*,
and that his life and essence will follow.

The key lies in refining nature and forgetting desire,
transcending the realm while counteracting its forces.

*"The Grand Preceptor and Station Magistrate arrive at the hall to discuss betrothal and celebrate.
They stand in attendance, addressing her as 'Subject.'
They speak of auspicious dreams,
and boast of the kingdom’s wealth."*

The edict was issued to clear the way and welcome the bride,
spreading out feasts and arranging women in rows,
displaying the palanquin—
a scene depicting the perilous ease of seduction.

*"The Queen steps forward, seizing the Tripitaka Master,
cooing, 'Brother,'*
taking his unadorned hand,
sitting together in the dragon carriage;
leaning against his fragrant shoulder,
nestling against his peach-blossom cheek;
choosing an auspicious day for the feast,
sealing their union in marriage and enthronement,"*
portraying the most soul-shattering, will-sapping affair.

*"Then came the enchanting music of pipes and drums,
the allure of rouge and powder;
her slender fingers, poised to lift the cup,
arranging the banquet seats;
a single exchange chair, the dragon bed where he was seated—
she giggled, dripping with charm: 'Little Brother, you’re also surnamed Chen.'
Then she said, 'Let me bestow a Buddhist name upon you—how about it?'
To add a man’s name to hers, clearly a sign of affection;
to call him 'Chen' while referring to the Tang, subtly hinting at his eastern journey.
The terms 'Brother, you and I,'—
the manner of asking his surname and given name—
fully captured her boundless tenderness.*

Of all human emotions, none is more easily stirred
than desire for beauty,
and what if that beauty is the queen of a nation’s charms?
What if she alone is the object of that nation’s affection?
What if she is not only the queen of beauty, wealth, and nobility,
but also adorned with every courtesy,
possessing a thousand allures and a hundred graces,
intelligence and tenderness—
side by side, cheek to cheek—
an encounter as rare and fleeting as the dawn of creation,
yet now placed in an irresistible position,
at a moment when resistance is utterly impossible?

How perilous! How perilous!"

The commentator says that among the eighty-one trials of the Three Treasures, this is the greatest of all—how true his words are! Fortunately, the Pilgrim had a scheme of *"pretending marriage to escape the net"* to revive the dead and restore life.

The Pilgrim said, *"Master, you just grant her request—I, Old Monkey, will handle it."* The logic of the world is such that the firm can be subdued by the yielding, but the yielding cannot subdue the firm. The Land of Women is the Way of yielding. When the Queen invites a husband and then abdicates, she yields even more—when yielding reaches its utmost, it becomes the utmost firmness. How then shall I deploy my own firm *qi*?

The Pilgrim said, *"Master, rest assured. In this place, encountering this person, we must turn their own strategy against them."* For she uses her utmost yielding to control me, so I shall use her utmost yielding to counter her. All her yielding is for my use—this is yielding at its peak.

Why? Because the Dao of seeking the Sutras must pass through the Land of Women—there is no way to avoid it. The Land of Women has only people, and people must not be harmed. The goal is to obtain the *tongguan xinxingbao* (pass and credentials) and thus achieve both objectives.

The Master said, *"Disciple, if we indulge in wealth and nobility here, who will go to the Western Heaven to seek the Sutras? Would we not ruin the great Tang Empire?"*

The Pilgrim said, *"If you refuse her by law, she will not exchange the pass documents and will not let us proceed. If she takes a dislike, her cruelty may be extreme—she might order many to cut your flesh to make incense pouches."* This metaphorically speaks of our great nation’s true *yang* being wounded. He added, *"Would we ever willingly harm her?"*

**"Must we fight her?"**

*"This land’s people are not monsters—still, they are people. How could you bear to slaughter countless innocents?"*
This metaphorically speaks of how that small realm’s true *yin* is wounded.

*The Awakening to Reality* states:
*"Great or small, harm none—preserve both nations whole."*
For if she is unharmed, and we are aided, then the Dao’s marvel is complete.

The Pilgrim preemptively cast the *Ding Shen* spell and devised the *"False Kinship to Escape the Net"* stratagem—tricking her into stamping the pass documents and handing them over, so they could proceed westward. *"First, we spare her life; second, we preserve your vital essence."* Is this not mutual non-harm, achieving both goals?

This false kinship, this *Ding Shen* escape—all for securing the *Tongguan Baoyin*. Without the Land of Women’s pass seal, there is no path to the Sutras. Thus, the queen must personally add the name and affix her signature.

The Western Land of Women is the critical waypoint for seeking the Sutras, hence the *Yingyang Station* and *Zhaotai Spring*—its pass documents differ from other realms.

*"The Master leaned on the fragrant shoulder, together ascending the phoenix palanquin to the Western Gate."*
The three disciples *"united in heart, harmonized in purpose, their attire in order."*

The Master bowed to the queen: *"Your Majesty, return—let your humble monk depart to fetch the Sutras."*
Zhu Bajie barked at her: *"What business do we monks have with you, this painted skeleton, as husband and wife?"*
With one shout, know this: beauty is but a skeleton, and false kinship is but the Dao.

Once the pass is secured, liberation follows—three hearts must guard against peril.
*The Knocking on the Diviner’s Song* says:
*"Snatch away the smoke and flowers, severing lustful desire,
Recite the *chan* hymns, singing the rouge-laced verses."*
*The Danjing* says:
*"The non-color is true color; the non-uniting is divine union."*
This law of nature comes from the West—its intent is to escape the painted flowers.

The queen’s pass document uniquely specifies *"Chen"*—clearly marking the journey from east to west.
East is *Zhen* (☳, male), west is *Dui* (☱, female). Ah!
*Zhen* and *Dui* in union—seemingly worldly yet transcending it;
Yin and yang paired—false marriage yet true marriage.
Following yet not following; opposing yet achieving harmony;
Using yet not using; purity yet perfect application.
Neither leaving nor clinging to female beauty—true copulation is not carnal.
*"A woman suddenly appears beside the road,"*
and seizes Tang Sanzang—beware the allure of smoke and flowers!

---
**Fifty-Fifth Chapter**
*The Lustful Demon’s Trickery*
*Upholding True Nature Preserves the Body*

A Disciple of Awakening says:
This passage reveals how female beauty harms—its venom rivals that of scorpions, hence *"Poison Rivaling the Mountain."*
The *"Lute Cave"* symbolizes the scorpion’s form.
When scorpions become spirits, their *yin* venom is unmatched;
When women indulge in licentiousness, their harm is even greater.
The Pilgrim struck its head, Zhu Bajie its mouth—
The Tathagata could barely endure the pain,
The Bodhisattva dared not approach.
All depict the venom’s overwhelming might—
Not a scorpion-like woman, but a woman shaped like a scorpion.

The earlier queen—maiden, human—was the necessary path for seeking the Sutras.
Without her realm’s sovereign seal, one cannot proceed westward.
To fake marriage and escape through *Ding Shen* was not only to preserve life but to refine nature.

This later woman—lustful, a detour on the path—
If one falls into her snare, the poisoned hook will strike,
And unless one steadfastly upholds true nature while resisting temptation,
One harms not only nature but life itself.

Thus, when encountering the queen’s beauty,
Use life-preserving methods to refine nature—nature thrives through life’s integrity;
When facing the lustful woman,
Use true nature’s purity to safeguard life—life is secured through nature’s virtue.

This is the essence of *"Lustful Demon’s Trickery"* and *"Upholding True Nature."*

The Western Liang women all claimed:
*"We are *White Day Ascension* Arhats,"*
*"Mistaken for Chinese men."*
This points to the Land of Women as the true realm of *Dan* cultivation—where one ascends in daylight—
Not to be confused with Chinese men as mere mortals,
For they possess such transcendence.

Regret and awakening return to the court—harm none, benefit all.

In Tang Sanzang’s first great ordeal,
He fulfilled his greatest purpose:
Securing the queen’s pass seal and adding his name—
A marvelous stroke.

The Immortal Master, fearing worldly misinterpretation—
That one might think he gained through defilement—
Cast himself into the body, even to the point of ruin,
Yet none could save him.
Thus, he offers this parable as a warning.

The green stone screen door is unbreakable;
The bee clings to flowers, reluctant to part.
*"Human flesh filling"*—concealing treachery;
*"Clear sand filling"*—disguised as beauty’s allure.
*"Wealth, honor, glory"*—still worth sharing;
*"Leisure and ease"*—only she craves delight.
*"Just right for chanting scriptures, reciting the Buddha’s words as companions,"*
Yet clear as the Buddha’s mouth, hidden as a scorpion’s heart—
Like a sheep with a tiger.
*"Do not say ‘a hundred years of harmony is true,’*
For know this: the monkey’s head, the Buddha’s hand,
The inverted hook, the pig’s snare."

The queen, though human, moves with propriety—
One may counter her schemes with guile.
This demon, however, harms life through lust—
Only brute force and spiritual resolve suffice.

Splitting the white bread roll nearly revealed a hidden treasure;
The whole roasted meat package concealed a lustful trap—
Yet the Dao-heart remained unshaken, though the human heart was exposed.

Two who converse risk stirring desire—
The two disciples rush to rescue, fearing peril.

Courageously they stand their ground,
Only then revealing the woman’s weapons’ sharp edge—
No matter if you’ve refined her in the Eight Trigrams Furnace,
Or forged her from Heaven-Roaring Golden Cangue Metal,
She’s a wanton, cheap thing—
Calling her husband to lure him in, yet wasting the iron-mouthed blade
Honed at High Old Village to pierce the earth.

Ah, the Master Tripitaka!
A true monk with true precepts—
Cloud-like emotions, rain-like intentions,
Unseen, unheard, untouched by thought—
Forged into my ten thousand pounds of refined gold.

Ah, the demon woman!
Her yin-scheming, yin-poisoned hands—
Coaxing, binding, calling out, *"Good husband, good wife!"*
Almost draining a man’s very marrow.

Ah, the Bodhisattva’s mercy!
Revealing her feet, knowing her tail,
Pointing to her true form’s subjugation—
Unless one attains supreme enlightenment.

Ah, the star Maotai!
Manifesting her form, raising her head,
Her high cries dying on the slope—
Truly, the *"day-see"* snow melts away.

When the Yang Official arrives, the lustful demon is suppressed;
When the sun reddened in the pond, the yin-monster vanishes—
Whoever steadfastly cultivates true nature
Will not let worldly desires disturb them.

Thus it is said:
*"Severing dusty ties, abandoning form’s illusion,
Pushing through the golden sea to awaken the Zen heart."*

Once, reading the Buddhist scriptures,
Mañjuśrī’s disciple Kumārajīva—
A divine monk—
Composed *The Treatise on Reality* in two volumes,
Recited at the Grass Hall Temple.
Emperor Yao Xing and a thousand high-ranking monks and officials
Sat in solemn silence, listening.

Kumārajīva suddenly left his seat and said to Xing:
*"Two boys have climbed my desire-barrier—
They need a woman."* Xing then summoned palace maids,
And after one union, two sons were born.
How could this true monk have broken the precept?
Xing further forced ten courtesans upon him,
Setting up a separate dwelling for him to receive them—
What difference is this from embracing a *pipa*?

At that time, many monks followed Kumārajīva’s example.
He then gathered needles to fill a bowl
And said to the assembly:
*"If any can match this feat, only then may you keep a wife."*
He lifted a spoonful of needles and swallowed them,
No different from eating.

The monks, ashamed, bowed in submission.

Kumārajīva had already cultivated an indestructible golden body—
Thus he could swallow needles and still conceive children,
Dispelling desire’s barrier, not breaking the precept.
Receiving courtesans was but playful *samādhi*—
Not like embracing a *pipa*.

At his passing, the funeral pyre burned his body to ashes,
Yet his tongue did not rot—
Proving his immortality.

Before attaining the elixir, how could one break precepts
And embrace a *pipa*?

---

The Fifth-Sixth Chapter:
*The Mad God Slays the Grass Bandits*
*The Dao-Confused Monkey Frees His Mind*

The son understood:
*"The Buddha said: ‘All minds are false minds—
This is called mind.
Why?
The past mind cannot be obtained;
The present mind cannot be obtained;
The future mind cannot be obtained.’
For the mind’s essence is empty—
Responding to all things yet not enslaved by them;
Neither within nor without—
Boundless and impartial.
Neither welcoming nor following—
Acting where there is no action.
Like a mirror, like a valley—
Things come and are reflected naturally.

Thus, though myriad changes arise,
This mind remains pure,
Never disturbed by them;
Still, never driven by them—
This is the true mind.

If, before things arrive, one has a mind to welcome them;
If, when things arrive, one is attached to them;
If, after things depart, one chases after them—
This is the Buddha’s teaching:
‘All minds are false minds.’

False minds harm the mind—
Dust accumulates, darkening the mirror;
Filth clogs, blocking the valley.

Thus, having a mind is letting the mind go;
Having no mind is truly gathering the mind.

Yet cultivating the mind in non-existence
Still risks falling back into aimlessness—
Aimlessness leads to obscured nature and trembling life,
Driving one toward death—
The mind’s root of mortality.

Only when the mind dies does nature pierce through;
When nature pierces through, life is fixed—
And returns to its origin.

The secret of eternal life lies in killing the mind;
The secret of no-mind lies in killing the mind;
The secret of killing the mind lies in forgetting the self;
The secret of forgetting the self lies in nurturing *qi*;
The secret of nurturing *qi* lies in tranquility without madness.

These three principles first warn of the harm in intentional mind,
Then of the harm in intentional no-mind,
And finally of the harm in both intentional mind and no-mind.

Only when struck before the Buddha as a six-eared macaque
Does one grasp the wondrous truth of killing the mind.

Alas! Few understand, few bear the weight—
Thus the Immortal Master must deploy his eloquence,
Unfurl the celestial maiden’s subtle tongue,
And expound these three teachings to reveal the truth.

Whether one recognizes or not is beyond calculation.

At the start of the chapter, a single word encompasses all:
*"The Spirit Platform holds nothing—this is called clarity,"*
Speaking of the mind’s original emptiness;
*"Silent, with not a single thought arising,"*
For the mind’s essence holds nothing—
Thus, the mind values no-mind;
*"Monkey and horse firmly restrained, no wildness—
Spirit steadfast, no arrogance,"*
Saying that having a mind is letting it go;
*"Banish the six demons, awaken the three vehicles,"*
Killing the mind to gather it;
*"All threads severed, clearly understood,"*
The mind dies, nature returns;
*"The color-demon forever destroyed, transcending the true realm,
Sitting in enjoyment of the Western Paradise’s bliss,"*
Nature restored, life preserved.

When Tripitaka faced the female demon’s trial,
*"Gnawing nails, chewing iron, with life’s last breath preserving his true form,"*
Like one in stormy seas asking for the rudder,
Or crossing steep mountains holding the reins tightly—
The mind was killed, not let go.

Yet ships capsize when the waters are calm;

The horse’s stumble,
always occurs when the path is level—why?
Because the mind is let go yet cannot be killed.

*"Master and disciples stood on the flat plain,
Eight Rules wielded his cudgel to urge the horse forward,
spurring everyone to move along.
The Pilgrim brandished the Golden Hoop Staff—
a shout, and the horse slipped its reins,
galloping like a bolt of lightning.
The Master could not hold the bridle,
so he let it go, releasing the full length of the reins."*

All depict the mind’s wild impetuosity,
seeing intent and letting the mind go.

Once the mind goes,
the owner loses control,
while the bandits growl like wolves.
Thus, *"Just as he was riding steadily,
he suddenly heard the sound of a cudgel—
unable to sit firm,
he tumbled from his horse."*

This is the harm of letting the mind go
while acting with intent—
as Zhang Zhuo’s *Seeing the Dao Verse* states:
*"Cutting off delusion only breeds more affliction,
Striving toward Suchness is also perverse."*

The bandits cried:
*"Here we raise a ferocious resolve,
blocking the main road,
seeking only wealth and treasure!"*

To block the main road and demand wealth—
raising a ferocious resolve—
are all acts of the mind committing theft,
harming others for self-gain.

Though the tiger seems a hero,
its ferocious resolve is the heart of a beast—
what matter this world or that?
The Master, saying *"In that world, he becomes a beast,"*
was also using the mind to urge goodness,
hoping to turn this world’s heart back—
yet he could not escape the snare of the mind.

The bandits, hearing this,
fell into such great rage
that they beat, bound, and tormented him in every way,
hoping to seize their prize,
unaware that the disaster of their own destruction
had already arrived at their heels.

*"The three disciples saw their Master dangling from a tree,
the Pilgrim bearing a blue cloth bundle on his shoulder,
approaching to call out to their Master,
asking what foul deed had befallen him.
The Master said: ‘These highwaymen demand a toll.
Since I have nothing to offer,
they’ve hung me here,
waiting only for you to settle the matter.’
The Pilgrim said: ‘Why did you speak thus to them?’
The Master said: ‘They beat me so fiercely,
I had no choice but to name you—
it was a desperate plea for help.’
The Pilgrim said: ‘I accept your offering,
and that is precisely how I am offered.’"*

Marvelous!
The Celestial Sage writes of the artful words of surrender,
the false pretenses of abuse,
yet suddenly inserts the word *"offer"*—
*"Helpless, I put you forward,"*
*"I accept your honor, that is exactly how I am offered."*
It plainly points to the greed and deceit
of those who beat and bind—
the greatest thieves among the elite—
while truly portraying the peril in one’s very life-force.

The Pilgrim feigned giving much gold,
bundling the cloth as tribute,
and quoted the ancient text:
*"Virtue is the root;
wealth is the branch."*
saying: *"This is but trifling matters."*
Indeed, he feared the words might be too obscure,
too profound for those who merely chant *"the, he, that, ah"*
or for bandits blocking the road to rob—
lest even common scholars fail to grasp such meaning.
The bandits said: *"Leave your traveling funds behind,
or we’ll resort to violence!"*
The Pilgrim said: *"Agreed—
the funds must be divided three ways."*
Then: *"Let’s secretly keep some for ourselves."*
And again: *"If there’s more,
we’ll share some with you."*

The words ring true as bandits’ threats and pleas—
their twisted tongues of *"Leave your funds behind,
or we’ll strike you down!"*
and *"We’ll secretly keep some for ourselves,
if there’s more, we’ll share it with you!"*—
reveal their malicious intent.

Yet in the *"University"*’s teaching,
*"To grasp the outer limits of punishment
while neglecting the root of fear"*—
the Pilgrim’s righteous wrath was justified,
for he struck down the two robbers without fault.

But the Elder Master, heedless of the Pilgrim,
took a wrong path;
instead, he coddled the grass-bandits,
praising the lone *"Son of the Sun"*—
thus provoking the Pilgrim’s temper:
*"Even if there are Jade Emperor, Heavenly Kings,
and all the gods—
let them come and complain,
I fear nothing!"*

Here, the **Way** is obscured by delusion,
and the heart runs wild with folly.
The tale twists and turns—
readers must discern its meaning.

*"The Elder Master harbors resentment,
while disciples feign agreement, hide dissent"*—
a heart that knows yet strays from truth.

*"The Three Treasures wielded his whip,
shouting: ‘We seek lodging there!’*
For though his heart was set on goodness,
he failed to judge right from wrong—
thus fostering robbers’ audacity,
confusing the **Way** and inviting evil,
unwittingly opening the door to mischief.

*"The Pilgrim roared in fury:
‘Leigong is my grandson,
Yechang is my great-grandson,
Mian is my great-great-grandson!’*
Here, pride swells his tongue,
while madness seizes his spirit.

*"Master and disciples ate their meal in the hut,
when the Elder asked of his lineage—
the Pilgrim replied:
‘Such a worthless son?
Why keep him?
Let me hunt him down
and strike him dead instead!’
A heart that would purge evil
yet wanders beyond restraint.

*"Yang the Just gathered his men to raid the gate;
seeing the white steed,
he questioned its origin,
learning the **Sutra**-taking monk
had sought shelter here—
then burst from the hut,
clapping and laughing:
‘Brothers! Fortune!
Fortune!
My enemy is in my home!’"

「”His emotions stirred, and the thief appeared—
the thief appeared, and the **Dao** grew obscured—
the **Dao** obscured, and his spirit ran wild.
Within his own home,
not to let go was itself to let go.

*"The old man let the Master and disciples escape,
but the bandit soldiers caught up with the Elder.*
The Pilgrim said:
‘Fear not, fear not.’”
To let go yet not let go,
not to let go yet let go—
all in letting go.

The Great Sage raised his **Golden Hoop Staff**,
striking down many bandits.
The Elder, atop his steed,
saw this in alarm and fled his horse westward.
The Pilgrim seized the villain’s head
and presented it before the Tang Monk’s steed.

*"With intent to exterminate evil,
yet his mind was mad—
madness in mind,
and his spirit ran wild.”*

All because of his intent to *"stir up the crowd"*,
to *"seek him out and strike him down"*—
the letting go was itself the letting go.

*"The Elder chanted the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell**,
saying, ‘I have no need of you now—
return whence you came.’*
The Pilgrim cried:
‘Do not recite! Do not recite!
I am going!’
The moment he spoke ‘going,’
he vanished.

*"To recite the spell was meant to still the mind,
yet now he chanted to let it loose—
proving that to recite was to let go with intent,
to let go with harm in mind.
With a heart like this,
he could not embody the principle of **‘tranquil stillness, utterly free from thought’**,
thus the conclusion:
‘**The heart’s ferocity and madness leave the elixir unripe,
the spirit’s lack of steadfastness makes the Dao unattainable.**’

**Fifty-Seventh Chapter**
*The True Pilgrim Complains of His Sufferings at Mount Lava*
*The False Monkey King Copies the Script at the Water Curtain Cave*」

The **Awakened One** said: *"The Dragon Clan Master spoke: ‘The greatest affliction of humanity lies in having a body; if I had no body, what affliction would remain?’ But I say: The greatest affliction of humanity lies in having a mind; if I had no mind, what affliction would remain?’*

*The *Nanhua Jing* [Zhuangzi] says: ‘I guard my form and forget my body, gaze at turbid water and lose myself in the clear depths.’ But I say: I guard my mind and forget my body, gaze at turbid water and lose myself in the clear depths. Why so?*

*The mind’s presence is the grasping of **dharma**. The mind’s presence as unvirtuous is the grasping of **non-dharma**; the mind’s presence as virtuous is the grasping of **non-non-dharma**. All sages, through **non-doing as dharma**, distinguish subtly—one must abandon **non-dharma**, abandon **non-non-dharma**; if **dharma** is abandoned, what mind remains? Thus, without guarding, without mind, the depths of all phenomena are illuminated.*

*Yet to say ‘no mind’ while letting the mind loose into **emptiness** is more harmful than having a mind. Why? Before **perfect clarity** arises, virtue and vice are confused—this is the **vast and chaotic void**. ‘The Great Sage soared in the void, advancing and retreating in difficulty; seeing the Tang Monk again, he gave no reply, seized the horse, and chanted the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell**.’ To let the mind loose into **emptiness** is to fall into the **vast and chaotic void**. How could one know that the **no-mind of no-mind** is both having and not having, releasing yet not releasing—thus able to reach the Western Paradise? If one is merely **vast and chaotic**, how could one go?*

*The Pilgrim said: ‘Only fear that without me, you cannot reach the Western Paradise.’ The Monk replied: ‘I truly do not need you.’ Again chanting the **mantra**, he did not turn back his mind. This was true **vast and chaotic void**. The Great Sage could only rise again into the void—desiring to have no mind while also abandoning the true mind, unable to force others to awaken to this mind.*

*Suddenly enlightened, he said: ‘This monk is faithless; I shall report him to Guanyin Bodhisattva.’ Guanyin is the **pure ocean of divine insight and discernment**. The Pilgrim said: ‘The Master has forgotten his duty and betrayed his gratitude, driving away his disciple and ruining a piece of virtuous destiny, without considering the suffering of black and white.’ His mind was deluded and unperceiving—how great was the harm of **no-mind**!*

*The Bodhisattva said: ‘The Monk’s heart is entirely virtuous; you have slain many bandits. By my judgment, it is your own unvirtue.’ If one says the heart is entirely virtuous, then the unvirtuous mind should be abandoned. The Pilgrim said: ‘Even if I am unvirtuous, my merits should offset my crimes—I should not be driven away like this.’ If one says the mind has merits and crimes, the **anger-mind** is unvirtuous, yet even the virtuous mind is abandoned—how could this be right?*

*This reporting to Guanyin Bodhisattva was not a complaint, but in the place of divine insight and wisdom, the heart’s proper abandonment and non-abandonment were analyzed, and its subtle principle was determined. Only when the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell** was recited was the mind truly unbound, returning to its original nature. Yet ‘the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell** was transmitted by the Tathagata, but there is no **Loosening Fillet Spell**’—without a spell to transmit, it arises naturally, and without reaching the Tathagata’s realm, liberation is unattainable. Thus he said: ‘I shall go and petition the Tathagata to recite the **Loosening Fillet Spell**.’*

*Marvelous, the Bodhisattva! Neither abandonment nor loosening was possible, so she said: ‘Stay here for now.’ ‘Seated upon the lotus throne, directing the mind through the **Three Realms**, with wisdom-eyes gazing afar, encompassing the universe.’ This is as the *Vajra Sutra* says: ‘One must dwell thus, subduing the mind in this way’—already hinting at the subtle realm of **no-mind**. ‘In an instant, she spoke: “Sun Wukong, your master will soon face bodily harm; he will come to seek you shortly. You must remain here—I will tell the Tang Monk to return with you to fetch the scriptures and fulfill your true destiny.”’ The Great Sage bowed in submission, standing at the foot of the lotus throne.*

*Ah! A mind of pure clarity is the Buddha’s true meaning; **calm-abiding and insight** are inseparable, dwelling in the **Three Refuges** of the mind. To release yet not release is the truth of **no-mind**. Thus the chapter’s theme is declared: ‘The True Pilgrim complains of his sufferings at Mount Lava.’*

*The Monk left the village at the fifth watch, both hungry and thirsty; the Foolish One leapt into the air, carefully observing—yet saw no trace of the village. This was the spirit not guarding its dwelling, having a dwelling yet not seeing it, observing falsely. Desiring to ease hunger but unable to obtain alms; desiring to quench thirst but unable to find water—this was the false realm of **no-mind**. Thus he suddenly saw the False Pilgrim and took him for the True; saw false water and took it for true; heard the False Pilgrim’s words ‘without me, you cannot reach the Western Paradise’ and believed it was the True coming to harass him; saw the False Pilgrim’s changing expression and took it for the True’s; saw the False Pilgrim’s cudgel striking his back and believed it was the True. In his own delusion, how could he avoid being dazed and confused on the ground, losing his satchel and scriptures without knowing? This was the harm of **no-mind**, unable to distinguish virtue, vice, truth, or falsehood.*

*Eight Rules begged for alms to obtain food, and in a moment of **no-mind**, saw a grass hut and begged for rice, changing his appearance; having filled his bowl, he met Sand Monk drawing water, joyfully returning. He thought his mind was pure, free from defilement, as if he had obtained a full bowl. How could he know that ‘the white horse broke free, neighing and galloping beside the road, while the baggage and scriptures had vanished without a trace?’*

The mind, in its pursuit of stillness, only becomes more agitated—just as the False can disrupt the True in this way.

Eight Rules said, *"It must be the True Pilgrim’s remaining bandits, come here to strike and kill my master, and steal the baggage!"*
Sand Monk replied, *"My master’s life has not yet been harmed."*
The Elder exclaimed, *"You damned monkey! You’re the one who killed me!"*

He blamed the True for driving away the bandits, yet never faulted the False for driving away the True.
He knew the master’s life was unharmed, yet failed to see that the master had already lost his mind.
He saw the True striking him, yet did not see the False striking him in his likeness.
He did not see himself driving away the True, yet allowed the False to strike him in the True’s likeness.
This led to the False striking him and stealing his satchel, yet he took it as the True striking him and stealing his satchel.

Master and disciples alike were blind and deluded—all because of **no-mind**.

Eight Rules wished to reclaim his satchel and rest his master in a place of alms.
The woman said, *"Just now you said you were going from the Eastern Lands to the Western Heaven—why is there another now?"*
Eight Rules laughed, *"It is I!"*

For there is but one mind, yet true and false are divided—how could there be two?
If the True departs, the False arrives; if the False arrives, all actions and perceptions are but False.

When Sand Monk said, *"I’ll go, I’ll go,"*
he too was not exempt from wandering into the realm of the False.

Thus it is said:
*"Though the body lingers, the spirit flees without guarding its dwelling,
A furnace stands empty—how can it forge the elixir without fire?
The Five Phases of generation and restraint act without harmony,
Only when the mind-monkey returns to its pass does the Way proceed."*

The False Pilgrim was but an empty vessel of the Law’s form,
yet the True’s spirit did not abide—like an empty furnace without flame to refine.
Though the ingredients were present, the Five Phases each clashed in opposition—
how could their nature ever yield the elixir?
It must await the True’s mind returning to temper the spirit’s course,
only then could the Dao/Way be forged through divine alchemy.

Sand Monk arrived straight at the Peach Blossom Spring’s Water Curtain Cave,
where he saw the True seated high upon a stone platform,
reciting the scriptures again and again.
The True lifted his head and did not recognize Sand Monk,
shouting, *"Seize him! Seize him!"*

He mistook the False for the True, yet the True had departed—
though he recognized the True at every moment, he still did not see him.
He mistook the True for the False, yet the False had arrived—
though he raised his head to meet the True, he still saw the False.

The False Pilgrim declared:
*"I struck the False Pilgrim and stole his baggage—
not because I failed to ascend to the Western Heaven,
nor because I loved this place.
Now that I’ve mastered the scriptures,
I’ll journey alone to the Western Lands to worship the Buddha and seek the sutras,
and deliver them back to the Eastern Lands.
I’ve achieved this alone—
let the people of the Southern Continent [South Jambudvīpa] erect me as their ancestor,
and my name shall endure through the ages!"*

Wonderful! Marvelous!

The one who achieves success alone, desiring to cultivate the Dao in solitary unity, is merely indulging in the delusion of the wandering mind;
the one who seeks to establish an ancestor and transmit a name, fixating on self-centered transmission of the scriptures, fails to grasp the true essence of *wu-xin* [無心].

Sand Monk laughed and said, *"There has never been a saying of 'Sun Wukong seeking the sutras.'"*
If one claims Wukong could obtain the sutras, then enlightenment could come from mere thought—why then did the Tathāgata command the Golden Cicada to journey east to west, and entrust the protection of three disciples?

Was it not a waste of divine thought, with no practical use?
Here lies the hidden meaning of the next section: *"The difficulty of cultivating true stillness in solitary unity."*

Thus, the False Pilgrim declared, *"Worthy brother, you know only one aspect, not the two.*
The single mind is true; the dual mind is false.
The solitary unity is false; the dual unity is true.
How can you know one without knowing the other?"
This profound duality permeates the text before and after—do not read it lightly!

He further said, *"Do I not have a Tang Monk?"*
Those who fail to recognize the subtlety of the true mind, abandoning truth for falsehood, will manifest falsehood in their own hearts.
If Tang Monk is false, Eight Rules is false, Sand Monk is false, the White Horse is false—once falsehood takes root, all is false.

Seeking the Buddha in the Western Lands and obtaining the sutras is but empty words—how could one physically reach that realm?
Thus it is said: *"The False Monkey King copied the scriptures from the Water Curtain Cave."*
*"Sand Monk killed the False Monk"*—this reveals the true soil.
*"To the South Sea to worship the Bodhisattva"*—this is the sincere intent to trace the origin and exhaust the source.
*"Suddenly seeing Wukong standing beside him"*—this shows that the true mind never leaves the Pure Land, and true intent naturally aligns with the true mind.

The Bodhisattva said, *"When Wukong arrived here, four days have already passed.
I never allowed him to return—how could there be another Tang Monk summoned to seek the sutras on his own?"*
*"Go with Wukong to take a look.
What is truly difficult to extinguish is falsehood; what is easily removed is falsehood."*

For seeking the sutras requires a true monk, and a true monk must possess a true mind.
When true and false are confused and one cannot deeply discern the heart, one cannot deeply recognize the true self.

Alas! In the fifty-eighth installment—*"Two Hearts Disrupt the Great Cosmic Order"*—*"The Difficulty of Cultivating True Stillness in Solitary Unity"*—
Master Wujī said: *"Man has but one mind; those with mind possess this mind, those without mind also possess this mind.
With mind, there is true and false within the mind;
without mind, there is true and false within the absence of mind.
Their forms and functions are identical.
If one cannot extinguish falsehood and adhere to truth, the two minds will clash in confusion, unable to distinguish right from wrong—how then can one gather the Five Phases to cultivate true stillness?"*

The brushstrokes of this passage all depict the chaos of the two minds, yet the key focus lies in the phrase *"the difficulty of cultivating in solitary unity."*
For the secret of *"the difficulty of solitary cultivation"* lies within *"the disturbance of the two minds."*
Thus, only after the Monkey is struck down does the text clarify *"once again in harmony, united in heart"*—six words that encapsulate the essence of gathering the Five Phases to refine the elixir.

The Master’s teaching transcends the divine—it pierces through the demonic and uproots the celestial root!

Wukong and Sand Monk’s *"two streams of light"*—one rooted in genuine conscience, the other harboring doubt—already illuminate the meaning of *"harmony in heart and intent."*
*"The two examined outside the cave and saw a pilgrim identical in every way."*
This was when the Triple Gem released the true Wukong, bringing him along as well.
*"Mingled together, indistinguishable as true or false"*—this lies hidden within one’s own solitude, something no outsider can discern for them.

Thus, even the divine vision of the Falling Rock Mountain spirit could not perceive it.
Why?
Because the two minds are one mind, and external observation cannot unify them.

Even reciting the tight-fitting cauldron incantation could not expose it.
Why?
Because the two minds originate from one mind, and no incantation can forcibly separate them.

Even with the divine eyes of the celestial hosts or the Mirror of Demonic Detection, it remains indistinct.
Why?
Because the two minds belong to one Wukong—vision cannot exhaust its depths, nor can the mirror’s reflection reach its limits.

Even *"knowing oneself as a friend does"*—later shifts in stance, hidden and revealed emotions—cannot be fixed;
*"knowing one’s younger brother as a teacher does"*—sudden unity and separation, coming and going unpredictably—cannot be measured.

How profound is the difficulty of distinguishing true and false minds!
For they dwell in the most profound and obscure realms, beyond what can be observed through external appearances.
Thus, one must seek them within the profound and obscure.

Entering the Forest of the Dead’s Hall of Records, one searches for them in the Monkey Ledger—
and if there are no two minds, there is not even one mind, already erased in the chaos of the Great Uproar!

Speaking of the truth of *wu-xin* [無心], one realizes the two minds are both delusion.
To dwell and listen, the true essence will naturally reveal itself.
Thus, Dìzhàng Bodhisattva said, *"Wait! Wait!
Let me listen closely to discern truth from falsehood for you."*

*Dì* [谛] listening—what others cannot know, yet you alone perceive.
*Dì* listening, bowing in silence, soon recognizing the strange.
It is not called *"seeing"* but *"listening,"* nor merely *"listening"* but *"close listening."*
Rejecting sharp hearing and bright sight, using the heart’s profound listening—this is the breadth of insight and the height of perception.

Again, *"Do not expose it directly; do not assist in capturing him."*
Why?
Because the heart has the power of self-deception, and there is no method to bind the heart.
He who knows this heart possesses this heart;
he who is ignorant of this knowing also possesses this heart.

The two hearts contend, the heart refusing to obey the knowing—
instead, it rebels against knowing and disturbs the spirits of the dark depths,
so he cannot be captured.

The *Dì* listening as spoken is truly the *Dì* truth—
it must not be disrespected or neglected in listening.

*"The Buddha-Dharma is boundless,"*
already pointing directly to the marvelous realm of no-heart,
where the two hearts together cause harm.

The verse says:
*"A man with two hearts breeds calamity,
across lands and seas, suspicion and doubt arise.
He dreams of jade steeds in the Three Exalted Offices,
then counts the golden palanquin of the First Rank.
Northward campaigns and southern raids—all futile strife,
eastward and westward fleeting like the serpent’s coils—
left and right, ‘wū’ and ‘guì.’*
The Zen gate must master the secret of no-heart,
cultivating stillness to nourish the infant’s sacred essence.

Carefully ponder the last two lines—
know that no-heart alone is the One,
the true heart not belonging to the heart.

Test listening as the Buddha expounds the Dharma—
with both presence and absence unestablished,
form and emptiness leaning on neither,
only then attaining the marvelous sound.

The two hearts battle fiercely to the realm of thunderous hearing,
where the great assembly listens to their two voices—
yet none can discern.

Guanyin especially came to pay homage—
knowing the heart as heart,
but unaware of the four monkeys stirring the world,
disturbing heaven and earth.

Thus the Buddha smiled and said:
*"Your Dharma-powers are vast,
yet you can only universally survey the affairs of the revolving heavens,
not thoroughly know the things of the revolving heavens,
nor broadly gather the categories of the revolving heavens."*
Meaning you cannot grasp the fullness of things,
but deeply understand the stirring heart of the world.

*"Four monkeys"* refers to the four wisdoms of the heart.
The luminous clarity originates from the primordial heaven,
knowledge arises from the subsequent heaven.
From the presence of subsequent knowledge,
the primordial luminous clarity is disturbed by it,
so the knowledge-heart must be extinguished,
and the luminous clarity-heart will then manifest itself.

The false awakening of emptiness is the six-eared macaque—
the term for *"six consciousnesses."*
The Buddha did not allow this six-consciousness to arise,
covering the bowl and alms-basket with the round emptiness vessel,
revealing its true form—
striking with the luminous clarity-heart,
a single blow to the head, killing the heart.
The marvelous *Dì* of the dead heart is thus.

Yet this kind remains extant to this day,
and those who say *"this kind is utterly extinct today"*—
it is because the Buddha’s bowl and alms-basket,
and the golden cudgel of the false awakening of emptiness,
still exist to extinguish it today.

The *Book of Documents* states:
*"Unknowing and unrecognizing, follow the Dao of the Emperor."*

The *Book of Poems* says:
*"The Supreme Lord watches over you—
do not let your heart be divided."*

「"Recognizing and knowing are not the marvelous Dao/Way of the transmitted heart—
the single heart is the Supreme Lord’s heavenly heart.

Once the false practitioner is eliminated,
the false Tang Monk and false Eight Rules are struck down together—
then the heart has no divergent inclinations,
and the Dao/Way may be subtly cultivated.

Discard the heart’s semblance of the Dao/Way,
illuminate the Dao/Way’s harmony with the heart,
and elucidate the essential principle of unified mind and intention—
refining the true mechanism of the Five Phases’ convergence;
preparing the chariot and steeds,
the Great Dao/Way is in sight.

Thus it concludes:
*"The Great Dao/Way, midway, departs from chaotic Five Phases,
subduing demons to gather in the unified luminous essence.
Divine returns to the heart, abandoning meditation’s fixed path,
six consciousnesses purged, the elixir naturally forms."*
This is the *"true Nirvana"* of true meditation,
the *"one body, hard to cultivate"* of its profound intent.

**The Fifty-Ninth Chapter: Tang Monk obstructed by the Fire-Flame Mountain**
**Sun Monk adjusts the Banana-Leaf Fan**

The Awakened One said:
*"Dual-heartedness is not merely the mingling of Dao-heart and human heart,
nor just the Dao-heart’s feeble doubt at halfway—
it is also not just one person with two hearts,
but three disciples with three hearts,
and those who fail to align with the Tang Monk.*

*Why?*
*For the three families must unite as one to form the embryo.*
*If only one body cultivates alone,
it is hard to attain true Nirvana.*

Thus:
*"The Three Treasures followed the Bodhisattva’s teaching,
retrieving the Monk and severing the Eight Rules’ and Sha Monk’s dual hearts,
locking away the monkey-steed,
uniting their efforts to press onward toward the Western Heaven."*

*This chapter links the previous meditation on nature’s essence,*
*and sets forth the subsequent marvelous cultivation of life.*

*The Fire-Flame Mountain of this passage*
*is the true Yang’s ascending flame.*
*True Yang must be aided by true Yin to achieve balance,*
*and thus generate all things.*
*If Yang is one-sided without Yin,*
*then the ultimate Dao/Way loses its center,*
*the dharma-nature remains incomplete,*
*though one may possess myriad thoughts and deliberations,*
*they will still result in illusion.*

*Wandering east and west on false paths,*
*how can one gather the golden elixir,*
*and refine it into the Great Dao/Way?*
*The opening line specially declares:*
*"If myriad natures originally share the same essence,
the sea holds boundless capacity."*

*It speaks of the unity of human and self—*
*not separable from humanity alone.*
*"Thousand thoughts and deliberations end in delusion,*
*all colors and forms merge indistinctly."*

*It speaks of the divine mind and all colored forms,*
*all becoming illusion—*
*must be dissolved without trace.*
*"When the day’s labor is complete and the path fulfilled,*
*the round and luminous dharma-nature ascends supreme."*

*It speaks of knowing that human and self share the same nature,*
*and that unified cultivation of body and mind,*
*when labor is complete and the path fulfilled,*
*will bring forth the unsurpassed round dharma-nature.*

*"Do not let differences stray east and west,*
*lock them tightly in the cage.*
*Bring them back to settle within the elixir furnace,*
*refine them into the golden phoenix’s hue—*
*as red as flame."*

*It speaks of this path from east to west,*
*the sole way for seeking the scriptures,*
*do not let differences stray east and west.*
*Diligently cultivate, returning all to your own furnace,*
*then you may refine your own Yin elixir of the golden phoenix,*
*and attain the same hue as the Yang elixir.*

*"Luminous and radiant, delicate and resplendent,*
*let me ride the dragon in and out at will."*

*It speaks of attaining this round and radiant essence,*
*the original source of all—*
*let me ascend to heaven upon the dragon at will.*

The Three Treasures inquired:
*"Why does autumn still have heat?"*

The Eight Rules wondered if it were the country of *Sīhāli* (Shahāli),
where the sun sets;

The Sha Monk suspected it was due to *falling into summer order*.

Seeing the redness of the farmstead by the roadside,
it was merely the color of the Fire-Flame Mountain’s heat—
no deeper meaning.

The old man said:
*"Our land is hot in all four seasons,
it is the necessary path to the Western Realm."*

*He reveals that those who seek the elixir*
*must pass through this true Yang region,*
*refining and tempering it,*
*and abandon all other paths for seeking the scriptures.*

*"Red chariot,"*
*"hot breath of the cake,"*
*again alludes to the fiery hue.*

*The secret of entering the fire and sowing seeds*
*requires true Yin to aid,*
*only then can they be nurtured,*
*hence the saying:*
*"If you wish for cake’s flour and rice,*
*respectfully seek the Iron-Fan Sage."*

*The Banana-Leaf Fan, once waved,*
*stills the fire,*
*twice waved, raises the wind,*
*thrice waved, brings forth the rain—*
*the meaning of the Three Yins arising,*
*and the *Kūn* Dao/Way being fulfilled.*

*The Iron-Fan Sage resides in the southwest,*
*on the Jade-Green Cloud Mountain,*
*within the Banana-Leaf Cave.*
*The southwest is the *Kūn* direction,*
*as the *Yìjīng* says:*
*"The southwest gains companions."*

*"Jade-Green Cloud,"*
*"Banana-Leaf,"*
*borrowed to convey the meaning of a verdant, cool cave,*
*able to dispel the summer’s heat.*

*"Red flowers, inner and outer alike,*
*truly sought, only then obtained,"*
*is the same as:*
*"To seek celestial treasures,*
*one must use worldly wealth."*

*The woodcutter spoke of knowing the Iron-Fan Princess*
*is the *Luo Sā* (Rākṣasī) woman,*
*the wife of the Bull Demon King,*
*and Sun Monk was startled.*

*Borrowing the fan’s difficulty,*
*he recalled the tale of the Red Boy*
*and the Broken Cave at the Sunlit Mountain,*
*seeing that what the Rākṣasī loved was the Treasure of Virtue.*

*Now the Treasure of Virtue is unseen,*
*and there are no red flowers or outer/inner alike,*
*yet he dares to borrow the fan with empty hands—*
*is this not again the same as the Broken Cave at the Sunlit Mountain?*

*"Though the Monkey Girl may show her utmost solicitude,*
*it cannot pacify the Rākṣasī’s rage in her heart.*
*Only because the Treasure of Virtue is not seen,*
*does she push open the Eight Ten Thousand Paths with a single wave."*

*The dialogue between Sun Monk and the Rākṣasī*
*is a segment-by-segment, winding description,*
*all implying that to seek true treasures,*
*one must have wealth—*
*no matter how clever in words or forceful in action,*
*it is all in vain.*

*Sun Monk was blown by the Yin wind to the Xiao Xūmǐ Mountain,*
*and sighed:*
*"What a formidable woman!"*

*Knowing she could not be approached lightly,*
*yet not easily approached either.*

*He remembered the Venerable Lingjì Bodhisattva,*
*who, when inquiring about the path and progress,*
*spoke of the Banana-Leaf Fan as:*
*"The Banana-Leaf Fan was originally*
*a divine treasure of Kunlun Mountain,*
*from the time of Chaos’s primordial opening.*
*It is the essence of the Great Yin,*
*hence its power to extinguish fire."*」

The essence of Great Yin’s true water
clearly subdues the true fire of fierce flames.
If one employs the treasure of calming winds
with proper method to obtain it,
what need be feared of not achieving great success?
The Lingjì’s aid with the Calming-Wind Pill
is indeed an essential practice for sincere cultivation.

Having obtained the Calming-Wind Pill,
Sun Monk then borrowed the fan,
stacking three together—
unshaken, as a stable foundation brings peace,
a prosperous land and contented people,
seeking battle to gain from others
while suffering no loss to oneself.

*"Clutching the pill in his mouth,
he transformed into a cicada,
entering her belly."*

This speaks of utter sincerity,
placing one’s heart within another’s,
so that no secrets remain—
as if seeing their very lungs and liver—
only then can mutual aid be attained.

This is not achieved through deceitful tricks,
but through genuine sincerity that moves the heart.

Sun Monk said:
*"I, Old Monkey, have never practiced deceitful arts—
only true methods, genuine power,
already playing within your honored wife’s womb,
already seeing her lungs and liver."*

This is the divine interplay of inherent principle and qi,
not the result of contrived techniques.

*—As in the* **Odes***.*

The lines *"式饮庶几"*, *"式食庶几"*—
this is the art of touching hearts with sincerity.

Thus it is said:
*"I know you are thirsty,
so here’s a bowl to drink—
let it quench your thirst."*

And again:
*"Now here’s a bite to eat—
let it fill your hunger."*

Such delicate, respectful metaphors of true sincerity—
a brushstroke of divine calligraphy,
a dance of immortal ink—
these are the joys of the literati!

Yet when I seek with sincerity,
and they respond with falsehood—
what then?

The Demoness of the Sandstorm had already spoken:
*"Your vengeance against me remains unfulfilled,
and how could I ever lend you my fan
as you wish?"*

*Child* (子) is the breath of the mother (母).
If the mother does not see her child,
then no kindness can please her heart.

Though they use my respectful heart,
they do not employ my true affection.
They may grant me the fan,
but not the *true fan*—
for their emotions are not fully surrendered,
and the precious treasure still hides itself.
All because I have not yet understood them deeply.

Thus, the Pilgrim takes the false fan,
unable to discern its nature,
and misuses it—
first fan, second fan, third fan—
while the flames grow ever fiercer.

For fire is the path to scripture-taking,
and since he cannot find a way without fire,
the fan is the treasure of true yin
to temper the flames of passion.
Yet he cannot borrow what is useless—
he must depend on his own strength,
as in *"seeing the golden husband but not possessing him."*

The old man with the *upside-down moon crown*—
he alone knows the true treasures within the furnace.
The ancient sage said:
*"Plucked from the upside-down moon furnace,"*
and there lies a profound secret.

Thus it is said:
*"If you still wish to borrow the true fan,*
*seek the Great Strength King."*

The meaning of seeking great strength—
first, to bind and take the true yin,
requiring mastery over the *law treasures*;
second, to restrain the wandering true yin,
for the Great Strength King is hard to control.

The verses contain essential keys,
like the divine dragon coiling in flight,
its head and tail beyond measure.

**Sixty-First Chapter**
*The Bull Demon King Ceases Battle and Attends the Banquet*
*The Sun Wukong Twice Persuades the Fan*

Thus the Sage said:
*"The Bull Demon King is the master of true yin.*
*To obtain true yin,*
*one must first seek the Bull of Great Strength."*

The Bull is yin-earth and great strength,
but as a Demon King, his might is even greater—
for he is easily unrestrained
and hard to capture.

*The Classic of Correlating Correspondences* says:
*"The Great Sun flows its pearl,*
*always desiring to leave man.*
*Yet when it meets the Golden Phoenix,*
*it turns and binds with it."*

This speaks of the yin-essence (阴精) in man’s body—
the pearl of the Great Sun,
like mercury in lead,
easily lost.

If one can obtain the *Golden Phoenix’s yin-qi* (金华铅气) to restrain it,
then it may turn to temper the fire’s heat,
binding and stabilizing it.

This is the Bull King’s attendance at the Banquet,
and his turn to meet the Demoness—
the shadowed borrowing of the Golden Phoenix’s yin-qi,
and thus the chance to unite with true enlightenment.

The heart belongs to fire,
the kidneys to water.
Fire is yang, water is yin.
The monkey symbolizes yang,
the bull symbolizes yin.

At first, they share the same origin,
then they repel each other,
and finally serve one another.
*"Five hundred years ago, we swore brotherhood,"*
tracing their beginnings.

The Earth Spirit said:
*"This fire was originally set by the Great Sage,"*
a truth confirmed.

The eight trigrams of the Primordial Dao were inverted
and entered into the Postnatal—
the fire of *Li* (離) grew dominant.
Men see the *Li* fire’s excess,
but do not know it comes from their own inversion,
thus saying: *"You no longer recognize me."*

*"Five hundred years ago, when I raided the Celestial Palace,"*
*"when Laozi refined me in his Eight-Trigram Furnace,"*
*"when the furnace was opened and I knocked over the remaining flames,"*
*"I was the Daoist who guarded the furnace."*
His words are clear and well-reasoned,
not a forced argument.

The *Li* fire cannot temper the flames of passion
without the *Kan* water (坎水),
and thus it must seek the Great Strength
to borrow true yin.

True yin is water,
governed by the *Xun* consort (巽女).
Without borrowing the Great Strength,
it cannot be fully obtained—
thus one must seek the Bull Demon King
through all means of wealth and treasure.

Yet those with great strength
must be tempted by external desires.

*"Now residing at Accumulated Thunder Mountain in Cloud-Drift Cave,"*
speaking of thunder stirring the clouds,
of rain falling at will—
of unrestrained lust.

*"The Jade-Faced Princess, with a hundred thousand treasures,"*
speaking of wealth and beauty together,
and desires easily indulged.

*"Abandoning the Demoness, never looking back,"*
speaking of neglecting true yin,
of never returning.

The flames grow fiercer,
with nothing to temper them.

*"Seeking the Bull King, bowing to beg his aid here,*
*only then can I borrow the true fan—*
for one must restrain desire,
control emotions,
guard true yin without losing it,
as husband and wife remain inseparable,
only then can true yin be obtained
to temper the flames."*

*"Accumulated Thunder Mountain lies to the south,"*
the position of *Li*—
the place of postnatal true yin,
a secondary consort in the outer chamber,
not like the Iron Fan’s original mate,
who holds the true fan of the Primordial Dao.

*"The Pilgrim searched for clues,*
*and suddenly saw beneath the pine shade*
*a woman of extraordinary beauty,*
*plucking a fragrant osmanthus branch,*
*gracefully swaying as she approached."*
A true sign of yin-essence manifesting.

When he feigned curiosity to inquire,
used pretexts to provoke anger,
and then frightened away her attendants,
when he embraced her and played coy,
when he wept, laughed, and spoke tenderly—
all her emotions were vividly depicted,
as if one could see her form,
hear her very words.

Thus it is made clear:
how alluring objects move the heart,
worthy of love and pity;
how the Bull’s attachment
melts the soul and steals the breath.

The Bull King met the Pilgrim,
exchanged old greetings and warm words,
and explained the reason for the son’s journey to Bliss—
now the son’s worthiness of renunciation was clear.

The Bull King spoke:
*"The grief of harming my child,
you have already spoken of;
yet you deceived me with my beloved consort,
stormed my gate—why so?"*

He plainly declared that the son could be renounced,
yet beauty must be seized—
thus revealing how the Bull’s devotion to color
led him to perish for its sake.

The Great Sage begged for aid and relief,
asked to borrow the fan to quell the flames,
and spoke of *"brother’s heart of opening heaven and earth,
leading little brother to visit the elder sister."*

He spoke of *Kan* and *Li* aiding and renouncing—
this was the heart of heaven and earth;
husband leading, wife following—
this was the Way of yin and yang.

If the elder brother did not visit the elder sister,
true yin would not be seen,
and true yang would not be aided.

The Bull King, enraged by deceit of wife and destruction of consort,
fiercely contested—
all to show his love of beauty and hatred of virtue.

When he heard the request to *"come quickly to the feast,"*
he abandoned battle for the banquet—
for once lost to color,
he would surely drown in wine,
one obsession replacing another.

His spirit and emotions were in chaos.
Lost in the watery abyss, rampaging wildly—
how could he not lose his own supporting strength?

Yet wine is water-gold.
Obtaining the Golden Flower,
he ceased his battle,
and there was room for change and transformation.

Thus the Pilgrim ultimately gained the Golden-Eyed Beast,
and transformed the Bull Demon King;
the Demon King ultimately gained the Scattered Flower Feast,
and came to meet the Rakshasa.

*"The Green Wave Pool among the chaotic rocks,"*
even in filth, there is purity;
*"The crab and shellfish know no decorum,"*
yet even in recklessness, there is order.

The Great Sage stole the beast and transformed its form,
then directly arrived at the Banana Grove.
The reader may think this was a trick—borrowing the true fan’s illusory technique—
but in truth, he seized the very principle of *yin* essence.

The Fire-Eyed Sage, with his Golden-Eyed Beast,
straddling the Water-Splitting Beast—
water and fire now share a meeting in form.

The Monkey-Heart takes it as heart,
the Bull-Demon as body—
heart and *yin* now intermingle in harmony.

When seeing his old wife again,
her affection only deepens;
when the wife sees her golden husband,
their bonds grow ever tighter.

Though their union is borrowed in form,
the principle holds true essence—
how could the treasure not naturally reveal itself?
There lies a natural marvel beyond artifice.

They mimic the joy of reunited spouses,
postures brimming with life—
sometimes laughter hides a trace of jealousy,
sometimes solemnity conceals coquettishness;
sometimes feigned anger betrays true affection,
sometimes playful pique draws out honest words.

Hand in hand, cheeks pressed warm,
they leap like twin fish playing in water;
clouds and rain in their glances—
almost too vivid to wash clean the Twelve Peaks of Wu.

The reader may say they’ve captured the intimate tenderness of married love,
yet they’ve overlooked the profound allegory.

She says: *“Your Majesty favors your new bride,
abandoning me—what wind today blew you here?”*
Speaking of loving an external wife while neglecting the inner one—
a fortunate turn when he finally looks back.

She says: *“I never meant to abandon you—
only that Princess Jade-Face was crowned queen,
household affairs grew burdensome,
and friends demanded my attention,
so I lingered outside—
yet I’ve even set up another household.”*
Speaking of being seduced by wealth and desire,
lingering in distraction,
unable to turn inward,
thus making the outer heavy and the inner light.

Then, feigning anger, she scolds: *“When did that damned monkey pass through?”*
And slaps her chest: *“Alas! Alas!
My lord was wrong—
how could you give this treasure to that monkey?”
“It kills me!”*
Speaking of the Way of the Pilgrimage—
without true *yin*, one cannot advance.
How could one pass without the true fan?
And how could one obtain the true fan without me?
If the wife had given the treasure,
that would be a true mistake.

「Then she says: *“My lord, you are newly married to the Great Sovereign—
do not forget your true bond of *yin* and *yang*,
and drink a cup of this native *yang* water.”*
Speaking of how the true *yin* and *yang* within one’s body are like the bond of marriage,
while the *yin* and *yang* outside are like foreign waters—
one must not indulge in fleeting desires
and forget the source of one’s true essence.

Then she says: *“I, due to my concern for external governance,
have been long separated from my lord,
yet night and day I guard and protect your ancestral domain.”*
Speaking of when *yin* and *yang* lose their proper alignment,
and one must bolster the *yang* essence—
this requires strengthening the *yin* foundation.

Then she says: *“‘Kang’ (康) is harmony (齐).
‘My lord is the *yang* parent that nurtures the body.’”*
Speaking of how *yin* and *yang* in perfect balance
bring forth the flourishing of all things;
true *yin* without *yang* cannot sustain and nourish the ten thousand beings.

When they stand side by side, leaning down to embrace,
and speak in unison to nourish the treasure,
clinging to each other in intimacy,
and reveal the *bao-bei* (宝贝),
the profound interplay of *yang* revering *yin*
and the mutual devouring of opposites
is beyond mere description or analogy.

The Great Sage gains the treasure,
lost in dark musings and divine contemplation,
while the Demon Queen, drunk on wine,
speaks of true sentiment and principle.

For the treasure is originally my family’s heirloom—
yet through reckless indulgence and dissipation,
I lost sight of its true nature,
and now cannot even recognize it.

Thus the Demon Queen says:
*“Great King, you must have been day and night lost in pleasure,
your mind clouded by that Princess Jade-Face,
so how could you forget even your own treasure?”*

For those in the world who live in dreams or drunkenness,
these few words can serve as a sharp awakening.

*“With the left thumb holding seven strands,
chanting ‘□ left “mouth” (口), right “four” (四),
hush, exhale, inhale, laugh, blow, breathe’—
it instantly grows two zhang and two chi in length.
This treasure transforms endlessly—
a fire of eight hundred *li*,
which can be extinguished with a single fan.”*
Speaking of restraining the seven emotions,
while channeling the singular *qi* (气) of the fingers—
true *yang* then flourishes,
and its boundless transformations unfold,
as the nine palaces and eight trigrams
are all but manifestations of this *yang* water’s wondrous effects.
Extinguishing flames and tempering heat—
what could be more difficult?

The Great Sage holds the true treasure in hand,
demonstrating its methods,
yet lacking the incantation,
he clutches it to his shoulder.
This cannot be swallowed whole,
nor transformed at will—
thus he cannot keep it without losing it again.

The Bull Demon King scatters the feast,
the Water-Beast having been stolen,
yet the lead is dispersed and true *mercury* (真汞) loses control.
The cause of the Crab’s reckless rampage is understood,
and the scheme of Monkey’s theft of the beast is revealed—
seeing remorse and regret, there remains a chance for return.

Riding the clouds straight back to the Green Cloud,
the Demon Queen shouts in rage: *“Heaven-damned!”*
Both husband and wife were careless,
thus the true treasure was lost,
and they are now in frantic haste.

The monkey steals the grandmother’s treasure,
the Bull King seizes the grandmother’s weapon—
true and false *yin* and *yang* are both disordered,
and Wood, Metal, Water, Fire all clash at once.

**Chapter 61: Zhu Bajie Lends His Strength to Break the Bull Demon King
Sun Wukong’s Three Attempts to Borrow the Banana Fan**

A scholar once remarked:
Readers compare *“Three Attempts to Borrow the Banana Fan”* (三调芭蕉扇)
with *“Three Visits to the Thatched Hut”* (三顾茅庐)
and *“Three Battles at Zhu’s Village”* (三打祝家庄),
as though these were all sacred *Daoist* talismans (宝箓),
mere set phrases in the novel.
It is like reading *The Strategy of the Rabbit Garden* (《兔园策》)
and *The Dragon-Tiger Scripture* (《龙虎经》)
without discerning their true distinctions.

The Fire-Flame Mountain descends from heaven,
meeting the earth—
this is the union of *Qian* (乾, Heaven) and *Kun* (坤, Earth),
giving rise to the three *yang* (阳) energies,
the Great Sage’s primordial *yang* *qi* (真动之气) transformed,
as explained by the adept who guards the Eight Trigram Elixir Furnace (八卦丹炉之道人).

**The First Attempt (一调):**
The Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),
seeks to borrow from *Qian* (Heaven).
In the first borrowing, *Xun* (巽, Gentle Wind) is born as the eldest daughter—
*Xun* is wind, hence the fan;
obtained from *Qian*’s Metal (金), hence the Iron Fan Princess (铁扇公主).
As the eldest daughter of Earth (土),
she is the first *yin* (阴) to appear.

**The Second Attempt (二调):**
The Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),
borrows again.
In the second borrowing, *Li* (离, Fire) is born as the middle daughter—
*Li* is fire, hence she sits in the south,
the symbol of a sovereign facing south,
thus the Jade-Face Princess (玉面公主) is obtained.
As the middle daughter of Earth,
she is the second *yin* to appear.

**The Third Attempt (三调):**
The Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),
borrows a third time.
In the third borrowing, *Dui* (兑, Joy) is born as the youngest daughter—
*Dui* is the marsh, the union of Water and Metal;
positioned in the west with a white hue,
hence the White Bull (白牛).
The bull belongs to Earth yet bears Metal,
traversing all nine palaces,
its power vast—
thus the Great Power King (大力王),
the *yang* parent that nurtures the Iron Fan Princess’s body,
the true *yin* sovereign—
thus the third *yin* appears,
and the true fan is offered.

Through *Kun*’s three borrowings,
three *yin* energies emerge,
to subdue the fire and nurture all things—
all rooted in the primordial *yin* *qi* (真乙之气).
This is the subtle essence of the Great Sage’s
first, second, and third attempts to borrow the fan.

*“If I were to demand it directly from his face,
he would certainly refuse.
But if he fans me once,
I would be sent eight hundred and forty thousand *li* away!”*
This reveals how *yin* and *yang* have cycles of mutual borrowing,
and how Earth can act as the guiding *qi* (用神).

Above, it can adapt and shift with the flow—
Earth subdues Water in reverse borrowing,
yet Water may also bring harm in its counterattack.
Earth borrows Wood in false alignment,
yet Water naturally brings growth and benefit.

Thus it is said:

「When [the fan] is obtained in the guise of the Eight Precepts,
the Eight Rules (*bājiè*) intercepts the Way and ambushes the Great Sage,
tricking him into surrendering the fan—
now knowing the roots of its acquisition and release,
he transforms as a peach kernel (*xìngpiàn*) and tosses it into his mouth.»

The Daoists regard the mouth as the Fire Flame Mountain,
and the true *yin* enters the mouth,
still invoking the *Lǐ* [hexagram] symbol.
The practitioner seeks the true *yin* within *Lǐ*
to achieve *Jìjí* [hexagram],
without relying on Earth and Wood’s functions,
they cannot acquire and succeed.

Thus the following passage focuses on
the assistance of Earth and the Eight Rules (*bājiè*)
as the backbone of action:
*"The Tang Monk sits upon the road,
and the fire *qi* scorches him—
his heart burns, his throat parched,"*
a lone *yang* rising to excess.

*"He questions the Earth Spirit and observes its powers,
summons the Eight Rules and commands them to exert effort,
rolling up the curtain to accompany him,"*
for Earth resides in the Central Palace and never departs.

*"He recognizes the path while traveling,"*
as Earth’s influence thrives in the south,
its vigor borrowed and sustained.

*"When walking straight ahead,
suddenly, they see fighting.
The Earth Spirit says: ‘Tianpeng, do not advance,
what else could be done?’
This means Earth can aid Wood,
and when the moment arises, it acts—
no waiting is required.*

*"The Eight Rules vanquish the Bull King,
while the Earth Spirit detains the Great Strength [Sun Wukong]."
Wood flourishes, Earth thrives—
the moment of their conjunction.*

The Bull King, the Great Sage, and the Eight Rules
strive with fierce resolve,
forging harmony between Metal and Wood,
thus manifesting the true *yin*—
hence, the Jade-Faced Princess of Accumulated Thunder Mountain
comes to lend her strength.

*"The Eight Rules, vexed by the difficulty of obtaining the fan,
contemplates taking an alternate path,"*
lest impatience and doubt arise.

The Earth Spirit says:
*"Great Sage, do not grow anxious,
Tianpeng, do not slacken.
To speak of an alternate path
is to enter a side door,
not the way of true cultivation.
Your master sits upon the straight path,
longingly awaiting your success."*
This means only the Great Sage’s Metal
and Tianpeng’s Wood,
when joined and united in purpose,
can exert bold action
to obtain the true *yin* Water
and fulfill the Great Dao.

If one abandons this and seeks an alternate path,
it is to forsake the true Dao for a side door—
Water and Fire cannot be *Jìjí*,
how then could one find the path to the West and retrieve the scriptures?

This is the Dao of *Jìjí* Water and Fire,
precisely to sit and watch
upon the straight path
for the success of Metal and Wood.

The Traveler (*Xíngzhě*) growls in agreement:
*"Indeed, indeed—
you speak with reason."*
He says: *"Well done, the Earthly Constraints transform!"*
He says: *"Shatter the obstinate void
and seek the Buddha’s face!"*
This means to act within the *Kun* [hexagram] Palace,
and through powers and transformations,
to meet the Buddha—
not like the Chan school,
which clings solely to the *xìngzōng* [nature school]
and falls into the void of obstinacy.

The Eight Rules exerts effort and says:
*"What care have I for the Bull King’s coming or not?"
This means to drive the Bull back to Earth,
the action is mine,
while the Bull knows nothing.*

He says: *"Wood in *hài* [the hour of the pig],
its nature paired with the pig,
dragging the Bull’s child back to Earth’s kind."*
This means Wood and Fire are paired,
*yin* within *yang*.
To drag Wood and Mercury (*gōng*) back,
preventing their wildness,
and make them return to Earth,
then the true *yin* is obtained to subdue Fire—
this is the Eight Rules’ exertion.

He says: *"From *shēn* [the hour of the monkey] comes Metal’s birth,
yet without punishment or suppression,
there is much harmony and *qi*."*
This means Metal and Water are paired,
clarifying the central *yang*.

*"With the banana leaf,
as Water’s intention,
the Fire Flame is extinguished—*Jìjí* achieved."*
The meaning is self-evident.

*"Two lead the Earth Spirit and the *yin* soldiers,
advancing together,"*
their actions never stray from Earth.

「Thus, in the moment when the three contend in battle, the Earth Spirit blocks the Way, saying: *"Great Strength King, where do you flee? We are here!"* The Old Bull and the Pilgrim engage in their own transformations and struggles, mirroring their prior contest in the Heavenly Palace with the Second Prince.

This one acts in accordance with the **Pristine Dao/Way**, following the **Heavenly Dao/Way** and the **Human Dao/Way**;
That one defies the **Heavenly Dao/Way**, embodying the **Dao/Way of the Immortal**.

Together, they display the marvel of one **following** and one **defying**.

The Old Bull ascends from Earth to Heaven,
first ascending to the **Heavenly Dao/Way**.
Transforming into a **celestial swan**—Heavenly Unity (*Tiānyī*) generates Water,
Water generates Wood, in **harmony**;
The Pilgrim transforms into a **sea-eastern green**—the **eastern green** is Wood,
Wood, though born of Water, **counteracts** Water—**defiance**.

The Bull King then shifts into a **yellow hawk**—Yellow belongs to Earth,
Water, though subdued by Wood, **reverses and nourishes** Earth—**defiance**;
Earth, though subdued by Wood, **reverses and restrains** Water—
Earth dries, Wood withers.

Thus, the **sea-eastern green** cannot subdue the **yellow hawk**,
but the **yellow hawk** subdues the **sea-eastern green**—**defiance**.

The Pilgrim then becomes a **black phoenix**—Black belongs to Water,
Wood, though restrained by Earth, **reverses and nourishes** Water—**defiance**;
Water, though restrained by Earth, **reverses and counteracts** Earth—
Water overflows, Earth collapses.

Thus, the **yellow hawk** cannot subdue the **black phoenix**,
but the **black phoenix** subdues the **yellow hawk**—**defiance**.

The Old Bull again becomes a **white crane**—White belongs to Metal,
Wood, though subdued by Water, **reverses and nourishes** Metal—**defiance**.

The Pilgrim transforms into a **crimson phoenix**—Crimson belongs to Fire,
Fire, though subdued by Water, **reverses and nourishes** Fire—**defiance**.

Heavenly Unity’s Water refines the Five Phases (*wǔxíng*) to generate all things,
never straying from the five colors—**eastern green, yellow, black, white, crimson**—
this is the Dao/Way’s **harmony of following and defiance**, manifesting in transformations above.

The Old Bull descends from Heaven to Earth,
later entering the **Earthly Dao/Way**.
Transforming into a **fragrant tahr**—Earthly Unity (*Dì’èr*) generates Fire.
The tahr shares kinship with the deer,
sharing the **Mare’s mansion** (*mǎgōng*)—Fire;
born from the **white crane’s** Metal, thus Metal **reverses and nourishes** Fire—**defiance**.

The Pilgrim becomes a **starving tiger**—the tiger’s domain is the West—Metal;
born from the **crimson phoenix’s** Fire, thus Fire **reverses and nourishes** Metal—**defiance**;
By principle, Metal cannot subdue Fire,
yet the tiger possesses the power to devour the tahr—
Fire **reverses and is subdued by** Metal—**defiance**.

The Old Bull again becomes a **golden-money leopard**—the leopard is of Metal,
transforming from the tahr—Fire **reverses and becomes** Metal—**defiance**;
The Pilgrim then becomes a **golden-eyed lion**—the lion is a Fire beast,
transforming from the tiger—Metal **reverses and becomes** Fire—**defiance**;
The Old Bull again becomes a **human bear**—the bear belongs to Fire,
the leopard transforms into the bear—Metal **reverses and becomes** Fire—**defiance**;
The Pilgrim then becomes a **reclining elephant**—the elephant’s power lies in its trunk—Earth,
the lion transforms into the elephant—Fire **reverses and becomes** Earth—**harmony**.

The *Sutra* of **Peeling** (*Bō*) says:
*"To follow and then restrain—this is observing the **symbols**."*
Earthly Unity’s Fire refines the Five Phases to generate all things,
never straying from the five **symbols**—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.
This is the Dao/Way’s **harmony of defiance and following**, manifesting in transformations below.

Heavenly Unity generates Water,
Earthly Unity completes it—
Water and Fire **achieve mutual nourishment** (*Jìjí*),
all returning to Earth.
Thus, the Bull King retains his original form,
and the **white cow** appears.

Earth transforms into **white**—
then Wood is **balanced**, Water is **harmonized**, Fire is **quenched**, Metal is **clarified**,
and the **golden elixir** is nearly perfected.
Thus, the Pilgrim assumes his original form,
and the **ten-thousand-foot golden body** is fully manifest.

The verse says:
*"The clever monkey’s efforts descend the **Dao/Way**."*
Speaking of cultivation relying entirely on the mind’s concentration and exertion.

*"The precious fan must be used,"*
speaking of abandoning Metal and Water,
which do not aid Wood and Fire.

*"The Yellow Mother supports the origin,"*
*"The Wood Mother shares the same sentiment,"*
speaking of Earth and Wood’s application needing diligence.

*"In harmony, the Five Phases return to their proper unity—**the fruit of righteousness** is achieved."*
Speaking of the Five Phases converging into one,
not harming each other, and thus attaining **Western Paradise** (*Xīfāng*).

Here, the **Great Sage** and the Bull King vie in pursuit,
with the **Eight Rules** and Earth Spirit striving at every turn—
the **refining** of Metal and Fire,
relying solely on Earth and Wood’s application.

Their divine generals and the **Buddha’s power** in guarding and intercepting,
as well as the **Li Tianwang** and **Ne Zha**’s decapitation and **mirror-like** projection,
are none other than the **spirits of Fire, Water, and Earth** shining forth.

To the North stands **Bìlù** (*毘盧沙門*), the **Sage of Great Omniscience** (*Shéntōng Guǎngdà*), to the South, **Victory** (*Shèngzhì*), the **Sage of Boundless Virtue/Power** (*Fǎlì Wúliàng*);
To the East stands **Bìlú** (*毗卢*), the **Sage of Great Strength** (*Dàlì*), to the West stands **Unbreakable Venerable King** (*Bùhuài Zūnwáng*), **Forever Residing** (*Yǒngzhù*).
From all directions, divine soldiers and Heavenly Generals gather,
with **Li Tianwang**, bearing the **Tower**, and his son as heavenly guardians above.

*"The Old Bull returns, transforming into a great white cow,"*
a **symbol of returning to the origin and the unity of the elements**.

The **Prince** manifests **three heads and six arms**,
mounts the Bull’s back in flight,
and cuts off its head—
**_Qián_** transforms into **_Kūn_**, symbolizing **_yin_**.
The **Bull** loses its head, symbolizing **"Wǔ"** (*the hour of the horse*),
thus piercing forth a head,
spouting black **_qi_**, generating **_yin_**, ceaselessly—
**_yin_** fully revealed.

Ne Zha then blows **true fire**,
and **true _yin_** and **true _yang_** mutually nourish each other.
The refining complete,
the **mind-mirror** (*Xīnjìng*) is used to fix the original **symbol**,
preventing it from dispersing.
Great Strength subdued,
the **true treasure** shines forth—
this is the **orthodox path of taking refuge in the Buddha-Dharma**.

Ne Zha drags the **white cow** back,
the **Rakshasa** presents the **true fan**,
and the **Four Great Heavenly Kings** (*Sìdà Jīnjiāng*) declare:
*"Revered Sage, congratulations!
The **tenfold merit** is nearly complete!"*
This is the moment when the **golden elixir** is near perfection.

They further say:
*"You must now exert your utmost in cultivation,
never slackening for an instant!"*
This indicates that the **refining fire** for the **golden elixir** remains,
and one must not slacken for a moment.»

The **true fan** once waved, and the fire subsides;
twice waved, and the wind stirs;
thrice waved, and the rain descends.
Creation lies within my grasp,
demonstrating the natural sequence of **fire cultivation** (*huǒhòu*).

The verse says:
*"Ne Zha leads the white cow back to the Buddha’s realm,
no longer capricious—
water and fire unite, their nature naturally harmonized."*

For when **yin** and **yang** are joined, the cow’s strength is tamed;
when water and fire merge as one, the **Dao** returns to its true essence.

This is why the **Three Baskets** (*Sāṃzàng*) serve to
*"relieve dryness and dispel vexation,
purify the mind and settle the will."*

The Cow King directly returns to the **Buddha’s Pure Land** (*Fó jìngtǔ*), taking refuge in the **Pure Realm** (*jìngtǔ*);
The **Rakshasa** seeks its own **true fan** (*běnxuān*), departing to cultivate in seclusion.

At the moment of **elixir completion** (*dānchéng*), all furnace, cauldron, and refining implements
are cast aside.

*"Continuously waving the fan forty-nine times,
forever severing the root of fire."*

Forty-nine is seven times seven—
forty-nine cycles of **fire cultivation** (*yùnhuǒ*), all now fully revealed.

Yet this is not forced or contrived;
it is the natural unfolding.

The *Yì* says:
*"The great unfolding number is fifty,
but its application is forty-nine"*—
just so.

*"Where fire is, rain descends;
where fire is absent, skies clear."*
**Lǐ** below, **Kǎn** above—
**yin** and **yang** in perfect accord,
the image of serene heavens and tranquil earth.

Thus the conclusion:
*"When **Lǐ** and **Kǎn** are harmonized, the **true essence** unites;
water and fire balanced, the **Great Dao** is fulfilled."*

This chapter closely mirrors *Chapter 62: Seizing the Tower to Purify Filth, Binding Demons to Rectify the Self*—
where the **Second Brother** (*Èrláng*) subdues the **Great Sage** (*Dàshèng*), using **yin** to clip **yang** and thus forming *Pǐ*.
Here, **yin** nourishes **yang**, completing *Jìjí*—
thus both chapters employ **Li Tianwang** and Ne Zha father and son.

Its profound and wondrous phrasing,
and the inverted yet brilliant structure,
are such.

The *Yì*’s principle of correspondence holds true:
*"Jade veiled in stone makes mountains radiant,
pearls cradled in streams make rivers alluring—
the **Floating Pagoda** (*fútó*) stores treasures, its light illuminating the four quarters,
while a human body attains the **Dao**, its purity shining through face and back—
one principle alone."*

Readers say:
*"The **Pleiades** (*Qūyè*) shift their abode,
bound to the **virtue** of the sovereign;
**Mars** (*Yínghuò*) alters its course,
moved by the ruler’s heart.
The **Pearl River** (*Pǔzhū*) regards profit and loss as ebb and flow,
while **Jing Province’s** fields rise or fall with fortune’s division and union.
The waters of **Xīyáng Creek** are clear or turbid
as they reflect the governor’s greed or integrity;
the **stone mirror of Lin’an** (*Lín’ān shíjìng*) brightens or darkens
according to the official’s praise or censure.
The logic of **omens and responses** indeed has its truth."*

「The sixty-second chapter—*"Purifying the Heart by Sweeping the Pagoda"* and *"Binding the Demon to Return to the Dao by Cultivating the Body"*—

**Treasured in Understanding** said: *"When gold contains jade, the mountain shines; when water cradles pearls, the river enchants. The Floating Pagoda stores treasures, its light illuminating the four quarters, while a human body attains the Dao, its purity shining through face and back—one principle alone."*

Yet, when the **virtue** (*dé*) of the sovereign wanes, the **Pleiades** (*Qūyè*) shift their abode; when the ruler’s heart is misguided, **Mars** (*Yínghuò*) alters its course. The **Pearl River** (*Pǔzhū*) regards profit and loss as ebb and flow, while **Jing Province’s** fields rise or fall with fortune’s division and union. The waters of **Xīyáng Creek** are clear or turbid as they reflect the governor’s greed or integrity; the **stone mirror of Lin’an** (*Lín’ān shíjìng*) brightens or darkens according to the official’s praise or censure. The logic of **omens and responses** indeed has its truth.

This **Golden Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*), though its treasures depart and its light recedes, is a metaphor for the human body stained by defilement and thus losing its **Dao/Way** (*dào*), where ruler and subject alike falter in their **virtue/power** (*dé*) and their transformations are obstructed—truly a profound and practical meaning. In the previous chapter, the master and disciple achieved balance through water and fire, having already attained the **mystic Dao** (*miàodào*); now, with **dissipation and idle thoughts** (*sǎnchǎn xiāoyáo*) dispelled, the Western Paradise lies in sight.

Yet one must **embrace the One and preserve the Primordial** (*bàoyī shǒuyuán*), nurturing it diligently at every moment, so that the heart’s clarity remains untainted. Only then can one await the **fulfillment of merit and the completion of practice** (*hòuzú gōngwán*). If even the slightest negligence or indulgence arises, then **supreme virtue** (*zhìdé*) cannot be cultivated, and the **refined Dao** (*zhìdào*) will not solidify. Hence, the opening verse of *"Temporary Residence by the River"* (*Línjiāngxiān*) is inscribed to emphasize this essential truth.

It says:
*"In every twelve-hour span, forget not to tend it,
a hundred moments of practice fully gathered.
Three years, ten times eight thousand cycles—
do not let the **Divine Water** (*Shénshuǐ*) run dry,
nor let the **Sacred Fire** (*Huǒguāng*) grow weary.
Balancing water and fire without loss,
the **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*) linked like a hook.
Harmony of **Yin and Yang** (*Yīnyáng*) ascending to the **Cloud Palace** (*Yúnlóu*),
riding the **Luan bird** (*Chéngluán*) to the **Purple Palace** (*Zǐfǔ*),
and crossing the **Hawk bird** (*Guàhè*) to the **Penglai Isles** (*Yíngzhōu*)."*
The meaning is clear: in a year of **thirty-six thousand moments** (*sānwànliùqiè*), three years yield **one hundred and eight thousand moments** (*shísānwànbāqiānqiè*). Each moment must be nurtured with unwavering devotion—no room for idle indulgence. For the **alchemical practice** (*dàn*) that follows, the **preservation of merit** (*bǎogù*) lies in **washing the heart and purifying the mind** (*xǐxīn dílǜ*), rectifying one’s nature. Otherwise, the nature will remain obscured, and the **alchemical elixir** (*dàn*) will not solidify.

As the master and disciple arrived in the **Sacrificial Realm** (*Jìsài guó*), they saw a monk bound in shackles, his **blue robes** (*lánlǚ*) in tatters, and inquired whether he was the wronged monk from **Golden Light Temple** (*Jīnguāngsì*). The **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*)—**no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*)—are lost when a monk bears such wrongs. Thus, they sighed: *"A fox spared from death laments, creatures grieve their kind."* This **blood-stained Pagoda** (*xiěguì*) is but the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) defiled by blood; its treasures lost, the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) have themselves lost their essence—thus, it is a single calamity.

Together, they visited the temple gates to witness it. The **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) could not bear the sorrow, and after bowing to the Buddha, they turned away, unable to face the sight, yet still perceiving the **great unity of all beings as the heart’s truth** (*Dàtóng yītǐ wéi xīn*). The monks came to kneel and ask: *"Your forms are not alike."* The monk replied: *"It seems the celestial deities were disturbed; last night, all received a single dream. Today, they truly saw such strange appearances, hence recognizing them."* For though **no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*) may differ in name, the **Divine Mind** (*Shénmíng*) silently reveals itself, and through **subtle dreams** (*yōumèng*), all are made known.

With the monks’ recognition of forms through dreams, the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) subtly imply the **Three Illusions** (*Sānxiàng*)—**no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*)—and draw the **Sweeping the Pagoda** (*Sǎotǎ*) lesson close to the **Tang Monk’s** (*Tángsēng*) own body and mind. When the text reaches:
*"The king said: ‘Holy monk, your noble bearing is so resplendent—how do your disciples appear thus?’
The **Great Sage** (*Dàsèng*) heard and said: ‘Your Majesty must not judge by appearances.’"*
only then does the meaning of **no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*) fully reveal itself. The **text’s profound intent** (*Wénxīn yōuzào*) holds **divine subtleties and hidden mysteries** (*shéncáng guǐnì*).

**"Relics"** (*Shèlì*) are the Buddha’s physical remains. In ancient times, **Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty** (*Suí Rénshào*) composed the *"Record of the Relics’ Omens and Responses"* (*Shèlì Gǎn yìng jì*): When a pagoda was raised in **Thinking Awakening Temple** (*Sījué sì*) in **Qin Province’s** (*Qín Huázhōu*) **Hua State** (*Huá*), the heavens sent a **divine snow** (*yīnxuě*). As the **relics** (*shèlì*) descended, the sun shone brightly, casting a **five-colored radiance** (*wǔsè guāngqì*), several zhang above the earth, resembling a **chariot wheel** (*chēlún*), directly covering the pagoda. From tens of miles away, those gazing saw the **relics** (*shèlì*) as a **pure red glow ascending to heaven** (*zhèngchì shàngshǔ tiān*). Once the **relics** (*shèlì*) had settled, clouds and mists rose again, and the **auspicious snow** (*ruìxuě*) scattered like **heavenly flowers** (*tiān huā*) upon people’s robes, lingering without wetting them. The **Golden Light Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*)’s **relics** (*shèlì*) emitting light was an **already attested reality** (*yǐrán shíshì*).

Here, the **Golden Light Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*) contains **relics** (*shèlì*), and its **auspicious clouds and rainbow hues** (*xiángruì yá cǎi*) are revered by all, near and far—this is no fabricated tale. The realm’s **literati are unvirtuous** (*wénbùxián*), its **martial prowess is weak** (*wǔbùliáng*), and the ruler lacks the **Dao/Way** (*dào*). This leads to **demonic calamities** (*yāoniè*), **blood-soaked theft** (*yǔxuě dào bǎo*), and the **four quarters’ despair** (*sìfāng shīwàng*). The **Tang Monk** (*Tángsēng*) was summoned, yet the blame was unfairly cast upon the monks. How different is this from one who fails to **cultivate the heart and refine virtue** (*xīnxīn dídé*), yet still **complains of heaven and blames others** (*yuán tiān yóu rén*)?

They said: *"The **tyrannical ruler** (*hūn jun*), the **corrupt official** (*zāng guān*), **a thousand tortures and myriad oppressive demands** (*qiān bān kǎodǎ, wàn xiáng zhuīqiú*), **the previous two generations were already beaten to death—now they seize us for punishment.**"* All spoke of **excessive punishments and heavy taxation** (*fánxíng chóuniàn*), **greed and cruelty** (*tānxīn nǔshēng*), **rooting out even the faintest traces of dissent** (*zhīmàn zhūmǎ*), and **deep-seated corruption** (*jīxí jiùrán*)—the very stains that defile.

The **Tang Monk** (*Tángsēng*) asked: *"What hour is it now?"*
They replied: *"This hour has arrived,"*
*"Give me a fresh broom of **new bamboo** (*xīn dǎo*), so I may bathe and sweep away their sufferings."*

This speaks of **self-purification through renewal** (*zìxīn xīn rén*), layer upon layer. If one resolutely begins anew from this very day, as **Pan Cheng** (*Pán Míng*) swore in his **ritual bath** (*mùyù*), then the **lower cultivation will ascend to the highest** (*xiàxué shàngdá*), and the **defilements of the eyes will be cleansed** (*wūguì mùchú*).

As the **Disciple** (*Xíngzhě*) swept, he heard voices from the pagoda’s summit. Stepping upon the clouds to look, he saw within the **thirteen-layered Pagoda** (*shísān céng tǎ*), two demons seated at its core—one **warming rice** (*pánfàn*), the other with **a bowl and a pot** (*yīwǎn yīhú*), **drinking and gambling** (*cāiquán chījiǔ*). This describes **seeking the body’s treasures** (*jiǎnshēn huòbǎo*), yet one must **steadfastly trust and resolve with clarity** (*wùdúxīn míngjué*), not indulging in **idle doubts or hesitation**.

If one does not **choose one path and hold fast** (*bùzé yī gùzhí*), yet **repeatedly wavers in uncertainty** (*fǎnfù chíchí*), **endlessly probing without resolution** (*tàntāo wú dìng*), then within the heart, the two demons sit like guests at the pagoda’s core, **endlessly gambling and drinking** (*yīwèi húcāi*)—nothing but **foolish conjecture** (*húcāi*).

The **Disciple** (*Xíngzhě*) pressed forward, and the two demons said: *"This has nothing to do with us! There is one who stole the treasures elsewhere!"*
For **doubt and conjecture** (*cāiyí*) are the true afflictions, arising from **confused understanding** (*zhīshì zhuóluàn*).

They named **chaotic demons** (*Luànshíshān Bìbōtǎn*), **Sage Kings** (*Wànshèng Lóngwáng*) and **Sage Queens** (*Wànshèng Gōngzhǔ*), the **Nine-Headed Prince** (*Jiǔtóu fùmǎ*), and the **Nine-Leaved Spirit Mushroom** (*Jiǔyè Língzhī*)—all revealing the **Sage’s self-assertion** (*Sèngzì xióng*), **endless deliberations** (*wànlǜ duōsī*), **searching the heavens and the earth** (*jí dì sōutiān*), and **comprehensive scrutiny** (*wúbù zhōudào*). Yet within their own minds, they **flounder in doubt** (*bēnbēn bōbō*), **add to the suffering of the kalpas** (*tiānzǎ jiéjié*), and remain **utterly without certainty** (*quánwú dìngzhǔn*).

The two lesser demons were named *"Bēnpōér Bō"* and *"Zhēibōér Bēn"*, mirroring their frenzied, chaotic, and frantic demeanor.

*"Confessing that Sun Wukong’s divine powers are vast, yet he persistently seeks only the fault of those who stray from the Dao—*"*
For Wukong’s steadfastness in this very matter, he could discern the faults of those who were not steadfast, embodying the principle of **"using one to overcome myriad"** (*dé yī yǐ yù wàn*).

*"The Pilgrim said, ‘This fiend specializes in malevolent deeds,’"*—rightly perceiving the fault of those who lack steadfastness—
*"‘Locking the demon at the temple,’"*—rightly seeking the fault of those who stray from the Dao.

*"When the Tripitaka Master bowed before the king, and the monks petitioned on behalf of the wronged, explaining the circumstances of the tower’s cleansing and the capture of the thief, the king was startled by the differing appearances of the master and his disciples,"*—
for the king saw only the distinctions between **humans** (*rén*), **demons** (*shén*), and **all beings** (*zhòngshēng*), unable to seize the thief.

The Great Sage declared:
*"‘One cannot judge by outward form—if one loves the appearance of wealth and splendor, how could one ever capture a demonic thief?’"*
His words spoke of purifying the mind and heart, of **unimpeded great impartiality** (*kuòrán dàgōng*), **neither within nor without**, **unattached to forms**.

Once one clings to forms, then one is bound to assess based on outward appearance, while **private desires** (*sīyù*) flood the mind and **demonic thieves** (*yāozéi*) run rampant—how could one ever hope to seize them?
This duty, then, falls beyond the capacity of the Great Sage **without form** (*wúxiàng*)—who else could be fit for the task?

The Pilgrim’s grand palanquin and yellow parasol, borne by eight attendants, were **simply arranged** (*suǒ yóu tè jiǎn*) for ease of travel.

The Foolish One laughed and said:
*"‘Brother, you’ve won this round for yourself.’"*

「Indeed, this kind of duty and merit is bestowed upon me by my own nature, yet not wielded by the Lord **Zhūnyán**—this is what is called *heavenly virtue* (*tiānjué*), not *human virtue* (*rényuè*).

The two demons confessed:
*"‘There is a **Universal Sage Dragon King** (*Wànshèng Lóngwáng*), whose daughter is exceedingly charming,’"*—speaking of **inner chaos** (*nèi*) and **outer confusion** (*shì*), **reckless calculation** (*fēnsù*), **concealing emotions** (*yǐnqíng*) while **favoring partiality** (*piānzhǔ*) and **self-aggrandizement** (*zìdà*).
*"‘The **Nine-Headed Son-in-Law** (*Jiǔtóu Fùmǎ*) was summoned as a **divine match** (*zhāozhuì*), with **unrivaled divine powers** (*shéntōng wúdì*),’"*—speaking of **external distractions** (*wài*) and **turbulent thoughts** (*rǎosī*), **clinging to desires** (*fùyì jiǔchán*) while **boasting in excess** (*zìduō*).

*"‘The Dragon King and the Son-in-Law meet as companions,’"*—**heart-intent** (*xīnyì*) and **material cravings** (*wùyù*) **intermingle** (*jiāochéng*), **"first unleashing blood rain"** (*xiān xià xuèyǔ*), **soiling oneself to soil others** (*zìwū yǐ wū rén*).
*"‘Then stealing the **Sacred Relics** (*shè lì*),’"**—**obstructing others for self-gain** (*fáng rén yǐ lì jī*).

*"‘Now he illuminates the Dragon Palace, making the night as bright as day,’"**—**vaunting in private wisdom** (*zìqīn sīzhì*), claiming he can **pierce the dark** (*zhé yōu*).
*"‘He also steals the **Queen Mother’s Lingzhi** (*Wángmǔ língzhī*), nurturing treasures in the pond,’"**—**coveting celestial merit** (*tān tiān gōng*), **hoping in vain to become a Buddha** (*ān xī zuò fó*).

This kind of **cultivation of the self** (*xiūshēn*) is **frantic and exhausting** (*cùyòng bēnpó*), **in vain wasting the eons** (*wǎng láo bājié*). Hence, the guiding principle is stated: *"‘Binding demons and returning to the true path is cultivation of the self’"* (*fǔ mó guī zhèng nǎi xiūshēn*), meaning **true cultivation must be grounded in concrete action** (*qìshí xiàshǒu*), not mere words.

To **seize the thief and capture the king** (*qín zéi qín wáng*), who but the Great Sage could **restore order** (*guī*)? The **Eight Precepts** (*Bājiè*) declared: *"‘I’ll assist Brother in seizing them with ease.’"* This is indeed **true resolve to act** (*nǎi zhēn néng xiàshǒu*).

**Chapter Sixty-Three: Two Monks Dispel Demons, the Dragon Palace in Chaos, the Holy Ones Subdue Evil, and Gain Treasures**

The **Awakened One** (*Wùyī Zǐ*) said: **Dao/Way** is not **empty enlightenment** (*xūwù*), **cultivation is true merit** (*xiū shì shígōng*). **Action must be decisive** (*xiàshǒu yào zhuó*), **first restraining the eyes** (*xiān wéi zhì yǎn*).

The *Yīnfǔ Jīng* states: *"‘The mechanism lies in the eyes’"* (*qí jī zài mù*).
The *Zhèngdào Bǎizì Jué* proclaims: *"‘The Eternal must dwell in the eyes; in the eyes, the *qi* follows the essence’"* (*zhēn cháng xū zài mù, zài mù qì suí jīng*).
The *Yì* speaks of *"‘looking upward and downward’"* (*yǎng guān fǔ chá*).
The **Ancient Sage** (*Lǎo*) says: *"‘Observe the boundless, observe the marvelous’"* (*guān jiāo guān miào*).
The **Buddha** teaches *"‘still observation and quiescent observation’"* (*jìng guān zhǐ guān*), while the **Four Sages** (*Sìshèng*) emphasize *"‘Four Abstentions’"* (*sì wù*), with **vision** (*shì*) as their priority.
The **Crumpled Sage** (*Bāxiān*) writes of *"‘Three Essentials’"* (*sān yào*), with the **eyes** (*mù*) as their pivot.

Even the saying *"‘The Dao/Way is right before you, yet you fail to see its command’"* (*dào zài qiánmiàn, gù zé míng mìng*)—from ancient sages, immortals, **Buddhas and Patriarchs** (*fó zǔ*), **scriptures and classics** (*jīng zhuàn*), **poetry and prose** (*shī cí*)—all affirm the **eyes** (*mù*) as the **critical mechanism** (*yào jī*).

Alas, how **mortals squander heaven’s gift** (*shì rén gūfù tiānfù*), **emptily possessing two eyes** (*kòng jù liǎng yǎn*), yet **they become obstructions** (*zuò zhàng*), **clouding vision** (*zuò yì*), **willing to glance or peer** (*gān piē gān kuī*), **yet unable to gaze deeply or discern clearly** (*mò néng dòngzhǔ shú dǔ*)!

This is what **the Sacrificial Kingdom** (*Jìsài Guó*) called *"‘the fleshly eyes of a common mortal’"* (*ròuyǎn fān tāi*), yet who knows that **immortals, ancient Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas** (*púsà*) **are present in the very gaze** (*xiànzài qiánmiàn*)?

The Great Sage’s **Flame Eyes and Golden Pupils** (*Huǒyǎn Jīnqīng*)—why rely on these two demons to **open his vision** (*zuò yǎn*)? *"‘Take these two small demons and bind them as eyes’"* (*bǎ liǎng gè xiǎo yāo dài qù zuò yǎn*)—this **clearly demonstrates the first step in cultivation is to restrain the eyes** (*zhèng míng xiānshǒu xiàshǒu gōngfū, zài zhì liǎng yǎn yě*).

The Great Sage could **pluck a hair to forge a blade** (*mó máo kě biàn dāo*), yet why **uniquely transform his Golden Hoop Staff into a Precept Knife** (*jīngú bàng biàn yī jiè dāo*)? *"‘With one slice, sever the demon’s ear; with another, sever the demon’s lips. Cast them into the water and say, *‘I am the Heavenly Equal Great Sage here!*’*"* (*yī gē yāo ěr, yī gē yāo chún, piē zài shuǐ lǐ, shuō wǒ qí tiān dà shèng zài cǐ yě*)—this **shows the resolve to act with fixed principle as a Precept** (*shì yòng dòng wù zhí yīdìng zhī lǐ wéi jiè*), ensuring the **ears do not listen to demonic sounds** (*ěr wù zuò yāo tīng*), the **mouth does not speak demonic lies** (*kǒu wù zhāng yāo yán*), and the **two eyes, plunged into the verdant waves, remain unobstructed** (*liǎng yǎn rù yú bì bō ér wú bì*).

**Precepts for movement, for ears, for mouth** (*jiè dòng, jiè ěr, jiè kǒu*)—all are **Precepts for the eyes** (*zǒng shì jiè mù*). Only when the **eyes are truly restrained** (*zhì mù*), does the **Heavenly Equal Great Sage** (*zhēn yī shàngxiān zhī qí tiān dà shèng*) **manifest here** (*xiànzài cǐ yě*).

The two demons reported: *"‘Disaster is upon us!’"* (*shuō huòshì liǎo*), a **warning of restraint** (*gào jiè yě*).
The Son-in-Law laughed: *"‘Mount Tai is at ease!’"* (*shuō Tàiyuè fàngxīn*), **yet he does not know of restraint** (*bù zhī jiè yě*).

He brandished a **Moon-Crescent Claw** (*yuèyá chǎn*), crying: *"‘What Heavenly Equal Great Sage? I stole treasures—what concern of yours? Yet without cause, you injured my head, and now you disturb my sacred mountain!’"* (*shì shén yī bǐng yuèyá chǎn, jiào shì shén qí tiān dà shèng, wǒ tōu bǎobèi, yǔ nǐ hé gān? què wú gù shāng wǒ tóumù, yòu shàng wǒ bǎoshān sī nào!* )

The **"Bright"** is the power of the sun and moon. The clarity of the eyes is like that of the sun and moon. Now, the Son-in-Law wields the Moon-Crescent Claw—this is the **partial light of the hooked moon**, unable to discern the Heavenly Equal Great Sage, yet he **plunders treasures and misperceives the sacred mountain**, wrongly taking the **restraint of the eyes** as an injury to his own.

The Wayfarer spoke: *"This fiend is utterly devoid of reason! Though I do not accept the king’s favor, you stole his treasures—monks are my kin by shared qi. How could I not aid in clarifying the truth for them?"* For **establishing virtue** does not arise from gratitude, and **acting in power** is not solely for oneself—**without self, others, or living beings**, this is true clarity.

*"The Great Sage struck first with a rod, and Eight Rules followed with a spade. That monster has nine heads—all eyes."* Yet he cannot **discern the past to know restraint**, nor **look ahead to understand warning**; though his eyes are many, what good are they?

*"Its true form was revealed—utterly ferocious."* Eight Rules asked: *"What blood and qi have spawned this beast?"* The Dao states: *"Birds are beasts."* Though birds have two wings and beasts four legs, how can they be said to be the same? *The Rites* say: *"The gibbon can speak, yet it is not separate from birds and beasts."* Thus, beasts include those that speak. This nine-headed creature—what beast is it? Birds that speak, beasts that speak—this describes something **far beyond human kind**, beyond what a single bird or beast could name.

*"The monster spread its wings and flew askew, then from its midsection stretched another head, biting off Eight Rules."* It mimics **glimpsing obliquely, listening wildly, and biting madly**—completely contrary to the **"Four Avoidances"**, yet unaware of restraint, arrogantly claiming might.

*"The Wayfarer transformed into a crab, biting through the rope to rescue Eight Rules; then using a hidden-body technique, he stole the spade and passed it to Eight Rules."* The crab—**dissolving, scattering difficulty**. Hidden—**concealing, the aperture of revelation**. This is **liberation from entanglement**, guiding the nature of restraint to **stealthy action**.

*"Eight Rules charged into the palace, smashing gates and vessels, startling the old and young."* This is the **vigorous effort to eliminate the old and birth the new**. *"The Wayfarer suddenly saw the pursuit of Eight Rules and, midair, trod upon clouds and mist, striking the old dragon’s head to smithereens."* This is **clear-eyed and swift-handed**, seizing the thief’s heart with the **unmatched method of one overcoming ten thousand**. Xue Wenqing said: *"Private desires have long disturbed my heart—now I must decisively sever them all to preserve my serene, pure essence."* Here, one strike slays the old dragon of myriad saints, and the **Emerald Pool is no longer muddied by chaotic stones**.

Yet the old dragon of myriad saints acted without wisdom, **drowned in greed**. Though it possessed countless principles yet failed to discern right from wrong, though named "myriad saints," it was truly **a thief many times over**. To kill the thief’s heart—**easy to destroy**. But the nine-headed demon, seeing much yet acting as a thief, **relying on its cunning**—though called "nine-headed," it is truly **ten evils**. With many thieves, its evil is hard to eradicate. Thus, **a great heavenly decree must be issued**, like the **autumn’s stern killing of all things**, to punish and renew.

*"The Wayfarer suddenly heard howling winds and grim mists—closer inspection revealed the Second Prince manifesting with the Seven Sacred Brothers."* Two—**a pair**; seven—**the number of minor yin**, the time of autumn. *The Daoist Canon Song* says: *"The White Emperor moves qi, the Dao is renewed."* This is the **great hour for eliminating evil**, a **mighty strategy**, hence: *"This is a grand opportunity."*

Autumn’s qi kills, yet **Heaven’s benevolent heart operates within it—life within death**. Grass and trees wither and dissolve, yet all treasures mature. This is **Heaven’s punishment**, exterminating the stubborn, purifying the people’s resolve, as the virtuous uphold righteousness, **cutting off desires and cultivating virtue**—all paths to **cleansing and renewal**. The Dao values **self-knowledge and repentance**, only then gaining salvation. The Great Sage, having *"once been subdued and disliking confrontation,"* knew repentance.

*"Eight Rules requested the True Lord to halt, and with the Great Sage, they reminiscenced in the Second Prince’s camp through the night, awaiting dawn to battle."* This holds the meaning of **Ji Gong’s triple kindness and quadruple virtue**, waiting until morning.

Why did Eight Rules slaughter the dragon’s offspring, why did the hound bite off one of the nine-headed beast’s heads, yet the monster escape unharmed? Because **the wicked seed was fully uprooted**, the **den of the great rebel pacified**; killing one to **warn a hundred**, leaving open the door for self-renewal. The leader’s head must be struck—**to set an example**; some thieves may be pardoned—**to show utmost mercy**. *"Even now, a nine-headed remnant drips blood,"*—**executing fully to satisfy the moment is not as effective as prolonged punishment to warn the ages**. The hound’s growl from its jaws **declares judgment to clear the guilty**.

Stele, the ninth month’s hexagram, **hides treasure in the fire storehouse**. The scholar must **sever desires and cultivate sincerity**, **severely reproach oneself**, establishing **virtue, deeds, and words**, preserving the **few and rare** to differ from beasts—**thus**.

*"The Wayfarer transformed into the Son-in-Law’s form, reclaiming the two treasure chests,"*—**turning evil into truth, gaining two from one**. *"Eight Rules pounced on the princess, producing the dragon widow, and left her in the tower,"*—**restraining the demon’s allure while revealing its maternal heart, abandoning abandonment to preserve benevolence**. *"The king uncovered the indestructible relics and obtained the heavenly life-granting grass,"*—**resolving grievances, cherishing virtue, illuminating the obscure and clarifying the mysterious**.

「**Tripitaka** placed the Buddha’s treasure atop the tower, enshrined the **Dragon Widow** within its heart, and the **Wayfarer** declared: *"With the life-granting grass, I swept the thirteen-layered tower layer by layer, placed it in the bottle, and nurtured the indestructible relics—thus, restoring the old as if it were new."* This is **self-discipline and earnest practice**, each step firmly grounded in reality, each step a treasure from Heaven—how could it compare to those who speak of **emptiness and truth** in vain, pontificating on the tower’s forms without substance?

The realm is called **"Sacrifice and Strife"** (*jìsài*), revealing treasure yet lacking **virtue’s** cultivation; the temple is named **"Golden Radiance"** (*jīnguāng*), flashing brilliance yet failing to embody **tranquility**. Now, the **"Sacrifice and Strife"** realm’s **"Golden Radiance"** temple is renamed **"Subdued Dragon"** (*fùlóng*), where **mystery and insight** dwell in quietude, its light returning and reflecting—this is truly **great and enduring**.

As for the **ten thousand sages** and **nine-headed demons** who flaunt their private interpretations, engaging in **stealthy plunder** and **self-aggrandizement**, bestowing **sainthood** and **wisdom** upon themselves—what **benefit** do they truly bring?

Thus, the conclusion is drawn:
*"The demonic thorns extinguish the Heavenly’s joy,
The golden tower’s light shines upon the Earth—**truly**."*

**The Sixty-Fourth Chapter**:
*"Upright at the Thorny Ridge, **Taoist** Treats with Earnest Effort—
In the **Wood Immortal’s** Hermitage, the **Tripitaka** Discusses Poetry."*

**Taoist** said:
"The **Dao** is vast and unobstructed, the world’s path smooth and open—**originally**, there are no thorns. Thorns arise from within the human breast."

In every breast, thorns abound;
In every heart, thorns are found—
Yet thorns stretch across Heaven and Earth—
Why single out **Thorny Ridge** alone?

This passage **specifically** borrows **Thorny Ridge** to encompass all ages, past and present—**thus it is**. It borrows the **Wood Immortal’s** Hermitage discussion of poetry to encompass **all** who speak of the **Way**, from ancient times to now—**all** are thorns, **none** escape like this **poetic discourse**.

The *Nanhua* (*Zhuangzi*) says:
*"Lost in the radiant, lost in the radiant—it does not harm my path;
Retreating from the crooked, retreating from the crooked—it does not harm my feet."*
**This is the pain of thorns** filling the way ahead.

I **do not avoid** the **thorny** reputation—
I **borrow** the **Heavenly Pound’s** strength (*Tiān Pēng*)—
And **unify** the discourse: **All** grand writings and splendid phrases, adorned with **eloquence** and **rich imagery**, profound yet stirring, **exquisitely refined** and **unparalleled**—
Some **deliberately** craft obscurity to boast of **depth** and **mystery**;
Some **recklessly** speak against taboos to display **talent** and **emotion**;
Some **eloquently** argue with **endless twists**, rolling forth ceaselessly to **enrich debate**.

Yet **truly**, those who **do not connect** their words to **self-cultivation, heart, nature, and life’s essence**—**all** are thorns!
Not only this—**all** who write books and speak of **mystery**, **emptiness**, yet **cannot embody the Way** with **personal practice**, merely **wielding pens** and **playing with words**, repeating **heard teachings** and **rumored sayings**—though they **utter all** the **marvels of the Way**, worthy of **emulation** and **transmission**, it is but **parroted cleverness**, **mocking reverence**, all like the **Wood Immortal’s** poetic discourse—**the most severe thorns**!

Heaven **born** the **three teachings’** sages, each **guiding the world** with **divided heads**—
Yet their **origins** all stem from the **Dao of the Yellow River, Luo River, the Supreme Ultimate, and Yin-Yang’s creative transformation**.
Later generations, **Daoist, Buddhist, and Chan schools**, split into **sects and factions**, **endless schemes** emerging—
They **compete** in **discourse**, **flaunting interpretations**, **mutually slandering**—**all** are thorns **within thorns**!

The **Confucian teaching** upholds **central harmony and singularity**, **unimpeded fairness**—
*"Citizens as one’s kin, all things as one’s companion"*—
**This is the most fitting and unchanging principle**,
**No different** from **preserving the Middle, attaining steadfast wisdom**—
**Desireless yet with desire, selfless yet with self**—
How **diverse** is this from **Mencius’** *"Cultivating the Qi"*?

Yet **Confucius** praised **the Yellow Dragon** (*Yóu Lóng*), saying:
*"In the West, a sage will arise!"*
Later generations **clung** to **textual details**, unable to **embody and practice**—
They **must reject** *"mysterious"* words,
**Betraying** the **Dao of the Yellow Emperor’s** *"mystery"* yet **unaware**;
They **must denounce** the *"emptiness"* character,
**Betraying** **Confucius’** *"emptiness"* yet **oblivious**;
They **must doubt** *"True Yin"* (*Zhēnyī*) **Qi**,
**Ignoring** **Mencius’** *"nurturing Qi"* yet **unrecognizing**;
They **must oppose** *"True Emptiness"* (*Zhēnkōng*),
**Excluding** **Zi Si’s** *"self-sincerity"* yet **remaining silent**.

**To debate principles**, why **quibble over words**?
They **must deliberately** reject and **denigrate**,
Claiming **defense of the Sage’s Way**,
Yet **what of** *"unimpeded fairness"*?
Is this not **severing thorns** while **thorns** **pierce** the breast **most severely**?

According to the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* (*Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn*):
The **Daoist teaching** began with **Emperor of Primordial Beginnings** (*Yuānshǐ Tiānwáng*),
**Opening** the **chaotic void**, **establishing** the **three powers** (*sān cái*),
**Transforming** to **generate** the **ten thousand things**—
Till the **Zhou Dynasty**, when **Laozi** transmitted the *Dao De Jing* (*Moral Teachings*) in **five thousand words**.

According to the *Book of Zhou* (*Zhōushū*):
The **Confucian teaching** began with the **Yellow Emperor**,
Who **commanded** **Cangxu** to **create script**, beginning **writing and contracts**—
Till the **twenty-eighth year of King Jing of Zhou**, when **Confucius** was born,
And **proclaimed** its **teachings**.

According to **Emperor Wu of Liang’s** *Buddhist Lineage* (*Fó Tǒng*):
The **Buddha** was born in **Eastern India**,
At the time of **King Zhuang of Zhou’s** ninth year,
On the **eighth day of the fourth month**—
From **Emperor Ming of Han’s** *Yongping* eighth year,
The **Dharma** began to **enter China** and **prosper**.

It has been **investigated** that the people of **Eastern India** are **naturally robust**, fond of **battle and slaughter**,
Considering **death in war** as **auspicious**, **peaceful passing** as **inauspicious**.
**Laozi**, upon leaving **Hangu Pass**,
**Transformed** the **Floating Image** (*Fútú*) **method**,
Ordering **internal and external purification**, **no harm to the body**,
And naming it **"Floating Image"** (*Fútú*).

In the **ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou**, on the **eighth day of the fourth month**,
The **fixed stars** vanished, **falling like rain**—
That night, **Shakyamuni Buddha** was born,
Capable of **practicing** **Bo Yang’s** **Dao** (*i.e., Laozi’s teachings*),
And the people **followed** him, calling him **"Buddha"** (*Fó*).

**Buddha** is what China calls **"God"** (*Shén*),
The next rank is **"Bodhisattva"** (*Púsà*).
His realm **teemed with life**, **no widows, orphans, or lonely souls**—
Thus, people **wished to be reborn** there.

Then **Buddhist teaching** **originated from China**, spreading **westward**,
And **returned westward** to **re-enter China**—
**This is not a foreign teaching**!

**Laozi** **was truly the Buddha’s ancestor**,
The **Buddha truly performed Laozi’s teachings**—
**God is Buddha, Buddha is God**—
Only **different in pronunciation** between **East and West**!

**Confucianism** **originated from the Yellow Emperor’s** **script**,
**Revealing** the **marvelous Dao** of **three powers’** transformation and **generation**—
The **Yellow Emperor** was truly the **Confucian ancestor**,
**Confucius** merely **proclaimed** its **teachings**—
Yet **how** did later generations **consider Yellow Lao** as **contrary to Confucianism**?

The root of all confusion lies in ignorance of the **three teachings’** origins—
And those who bear **thorns in their breast** are the most extreme!

The **Buddha** is **God**; **immortals** are **God**.
**Perfect sincerity**—**ineffable and divine**—is what we call **God**.
Though all are called **God**, yet to claim **Confucianism** differs from the **two schools**,
Is this not to **plant thorns** within oneself?

The **Celestial Emperor** loved the **people** He created and transformed,
And specially begot the **sacred Son of Heaven** to govern and nurture them;
He specially begot the **three teachings’ great sages** to reveal the **principles of creation**,
To exhaust the **methods of teaching and transformation**,
And to refine the **qi and fate** of countless ages.
Born in the same era, yet guiding along separate paths—
The **Celestial Emperor** truly **oversaw them all**.

I have heard that **Zhuangzi** followed the **open lineage of the revealed tradition**,
That **Yashodhara**, wife of **Shakyamuni**, and **Rahula**, his son,
When ascending, wept and lamented bitterly—
How could this compare to today’s **widows and lonely souls**?

Later generations despised the **corruptions** of the **two schools**,
Yet failed to despise the **corruptions of Confucianism** as well.
Clinging rigidly, they scrutinized **single phrases or characters**,
And **slandered the sages**, defying **Heaven**—
Their own breasts bristled with **thorns**, yet they sought to **prune the world’s thorns**?

Now’s **Confucian scholar**, collecting **fleeting arts**,
Aspiring to **official rank and wealth**,
Their **initial thoughts and motives** are but **merchants’ schemes for profit and gain**—
They know not what **nature and life** are,
Nor what **benevolent governance** entails.
Their **knowledge and abilities** diverge utterly from the **scriptures’ teachings**—
The **heterodoxies of Confucianism** surpass those of the **two schools**,
Yet they fail to **prune the thorns**—
I do not know where this path will end.

Thus, I must speak of **thorns**,
To aid **Tianpeng** like a **myriad-legged insect** in battle.

If this book speaks of **demons and marvels**,
Men will see it as **thorns sprouting at every step of the Dao**—
Yet I see it as **orchids and osmanthus planted at every stride**.
The **discerning** will gather them.

At the **beginning**, the monks of **Fulong Temple** knew neither **advance nor retreat**,
And presumptuously hoped to join—
They do not grasp the **abundance of thorns** along the Dao.

The **traveler**, when the **tiger transforms**, must **halt and dwell**—
There is a **"Great Man’s tiger-transformation"**,
Unrecognized by the common crowd.

At **Jingjie Ridge**, one cannot proceed further—
As the poem says:
*"Everywhere brambles twine around ancient trees,
Layer upon layer, vines coil about the thick branches.
Who among men does not encounter thorns?
Yet who has seen the **Western Lands’ thorns** so vast?"*
This clearly states that the **West** too is thick with **thorns**—
It refers to **empty talk of poetry and prose**, like those at **Muxian An**.

The **Eight Precepts** say:
*"If you wish to cross, depend on me."*
The blame lies in one’s **own power to prune the thorns**.

The body stretches twenty *zhang* long,
The handle thirty *zhang*—
Both hands wield the hoe,
Left and right, clearing the way.

For the body holds the **Two Principles**,
The hands grasp the **Three Powers**,
Uniting the **Five Phases** to illuminate the **Precepts’ essence**—
Striving to prune the thorns with resolve.

Thus it is said:
*"From now on, the Eight Precepts break through,
Piercing the Western Path—smooth and clear."*

At an open stretch, suddenly met
By the **Eighteen Elders’** friends discussing poetry.
**Naive Master**, **Lofty Scholar**, and **Wisp-Clearing Hermit**
Recite verses all revealing their true nature—
Their meaning is self-evident.

Only they say:
*"We are not the ‘Four Sage Ministers,’
But the ‘Four Operatives’ of the deep mountains."*
To show that those who claim to cultivate the Dao
Yet flee the world’s clamor,
Feigning seclusion and lofty detachment,
Speaking grandly of **nature and life**
While utterly lacking substance—
All are **Confucian scholars’ Cao Cao**.

All deceitful pretenders
Must seek to associate with sincere gentlemen
To lend their names credibility,
Thus they contrive to ensnare **Tripitaka**
And engage him in **Chan** and Dao discourse.

**Tripitaka** responds with common teachings,
But when he says:
*"I’ve questioned **True Essence** at **Yuan Shi’s** anvil,
Realized **Muni’s** methods,"*
And again:
*"Who at the **Mystic Pass** can cross?
I’ve long cultivated **Great Awakening Chan**—
Only those with **root and resolve** may awaken,"*
This is the **Dao’s true truth**,
Not empty **Chan**—**Buddha is Immortal**.

The **Four Elders** say:
*"The **Venerable Monk** grasps the **Chan’s root essence,"*
A fitting observation.

**Wisp-Clearing Hermit** declares:
*"Though **Chan** is still, though **Law** is passed,
One must settle the **nature**, purify the **heart**—
All for the **Great Awakening’s true Immortal**,
Ultimately attaining the **Path of No-Birth."*
This strikes the mark.

When they say:
*"Our **Mystic** is far different,"*
They mean **nature’s original essence**—
Unbroken, unharmed,
Needing no cultivation,
Returning to verify the Dao.

This is **substance without cultivation**,
**Knowledge without practice**—
Externally boasting of lofty talk,
Internally lacking true benefit—
Thus they are **"Operatives."**

When they say:
*"We were born firm and solid,"*
Such words merely describe their **nature**,
With no profound meaning.

As for:
*"The Dao originates in China,
Yet they seek verification in the West—
Wasting grass-sandals for nothing,
Unclear what they’re searching for.
Stone lions’ hearts carved out,
Fox spirits’ saliva seeping to the bone.
Forgotten roots, they meditate in vain,
Chasing **Buddha’s fruit**—
All riddles of **Jingjie Ridge’s brambles**,
Empty **Luo-luo** jokes."*

They also say:
*"One must examine the face before them,
Within stillness, life unfolds.
Bottomless bamboo basket drawing water,
Rootless iron tree blooming.
Chained to **Lingbao Peak’s** foot,
Returning to the **Yahui Assembly** on dragon-clouds."*
Each word shatters the **Chan’s empty void**,
Drawing out the **mystic essence**.

The core of *Journey to the West* lies here—
**Jingjie Ridge’s** entire framework!

**Lofty Scholar** says:
*"Wisp-Clearing’s words reveal too much.
The **Venerable Monk** need not cling."*

This is how the **Master** uses their mouths
To reveal the **true Dao’s profound truth**.

Once the **true meaning** is reached,
One must know **false learning**.

The **Four Operatives** gather for **Moonlit Wandering**,
Not for **lectures on cultivation**;
The **Four Elders** dwell with **wood and stone**,
Only becoming **naked ghostly messengers**.

Polishing verses, crafting odd phrases,
Boasting of **literary skill**;
Taking pride in **reclusion’s leisure**,
Drifting in forests and valleys—**self-abandoned**.

Formless, useless,
Arrogant yet ordinary,
Pure in speech, corrupt in deed,
Unaware of death—
How pitiful!

Some mistakenly claim **True Cultivation**,
Hoarding **A-Jiao** to refine **yin essence**;
Jealous of the upright, they unleash **Red Lotus**,
Breaking **Precepts**—
This is how **Moon-Playing Poet** and **Peach Immortal** originate,
Exposing their deceit.

**Tripitaka** says:
*"You are all monstrous creatures,"*
All **Operatives**.

At first, they discussed **Dao** with **elegance**,
Now they lure with **beautiful women**—
Clearly exposed, no need for further explanation.

At dawn, the demons scatter in alarm,
The **Master and disciples** trace the roots—
They are **cypress, cedar, pine, and bamboo** turned monstrous,
Clearly the **Dao’s and Buddha’s thorns’ essence**,
Yet they feign **scholarly pretension**.

**Eight Rules** strives mightily,
Crushing them all—
How splendidly clear!

Students, beware—
Do not abandon **life-and-death’s true practice**
For empty **moral discourse**,
Nor compose **useless poetry**,
Content to be the **Four Operatives** of **Muxian An**.

**Lu Xiangshan** said:
*"Tell my fellow travelers—
Do not let words corrupt **Heaven’s order."*
**Zou Nan Gao** also said:
*"Tell the young at the window—
Do not waste your youth on **commentary and prose."*
One meaning.

**Chapter 65**
*The Demon’s Feigned Small Pure Land*
*The Four Disciples All Suffer Great Calamity*

「The **Master** said:
*"In the previous section, the demon assumed a lofty, boastful guise, relying on innate talent, yet neglecting **cultivation and practice**—only fostering idle **lectures and debates**, composing hollow **poetry and prose**, dwelling in secluded, leisurely places to appear as a **strange figure**. Here, the demon feigns the **Buddha’s** name, seizing **dharma and reason** to deceive, adorns its outward form with cunning artifice, and entices many of the **good** into confusion—none can distinguish it, though it appears **authentic**. The former harms itself and others in a minor way; this one harms others to the point of **destroying life and extinguishing nature**, even using **scholarship** to slaughter the **future generations of the world**—thus, it is the **great calamity**!

*"The **Tripitaka Master** has escaped the **thorny entanglements** of the **Ugly Peak**, now gazing upon lofty mountains that touch the **Heavenly realm**. Descending the pass to the west, he suddenly beholds a radiant **auspicious aura**, with swirling **colorful mists**, and **palaces and pavilions** faintly glimpsed through the **temple bells**. The **pilgrim** examines it closely—within the **auspicious signs**, there are also ominous **qi** and **portents**. Though it is **Léiyīn Temple**, the **path and way** are clearly **erroneous and misguided**.

*"The **Dao’s** true or false nature each bears its own **qi and portents**. The **true** flourishes from the **root of the heart**, while the **false** is mere outward adornment. The **qi** of the **rooted heart** is like flowers growing naturally from a tree—spirit vibrant, arising from **authentic virtue**. The **qi** of **adorned appearance** is like **clipped paper flowers**—colors dull and lifeless, born from **artifice and contrivance**. The distinction is clear: those with **clear insight** can discern it at once. Hence, the **pilgrim** observes carefully and knows this **path is flawed**.

*"Léiyīn Temple," though called such, is marked as **‘small’**—a **clear indication** of the **petty**. The **Tripitaka Master** cannot see its **smallness**, nor its **falsehood**, so he mistakes it for the **Buddha’s** pure **dharma-ground**, leading his **disciples** to bow in reverence. The **pilgrim**, however, sees its **smallness** and **falsehood**, and thus wields his staff, shouting:
*"How dare you falsely invoke the **Buddha’s** name and tarnish the **pure virtue** of the **Tathāgata**?"*
He **denounces the crime** and **demands justice**, with **rightful authority** and **proper words**. Yet the **Tripitaka Master** has already bowed and fallen into the **trap**—even the wisest cannot undo this now!

*"He was left behind with a **golden gong**, head and feet included. All was bound within it. The **Master and disciples** were seized together, their **bodies and minds** both ensnared. The **Buddha’s** form revealed itself as **demonic**, and the **Arahat** were all **minor demons**."*

This is precisely how the **petty’s Dao** is small yet its **demonic magic** vast—straying into false paths, how could one not waste their **heart of seeking the Way**? The **verse is plain**; no need for **explication**.

*"What is this **‘golden gong’**?"*

「“**Gong** (鐙) and “**Nao** (挠)” share the same meaning. Zhuangzi said, *“Heaven generates all things, none sufficient to **nao** (挠) the heart”*—meaning one must remain unyielding in their **Dao/Way** and never bend to falsehood.

The hearts of the **petty** are crooked, yielding to desires, steadfast yet unmovable, clinging to evil until the end, obstinate in their delusions, utterly dark with no glimmer of insight. This is what is called *“the lowest of the low cannot be swayed”*—like a **golden gong** (金鐙) sealed tight, unable to be pried open or emit a sound. Thus, the **pilgrims** were trapped inside it, in a black void from which they could not escape. Its **power** could even **spread and penetrate** like molten gold, rising to the high or sinking to the low, expertly sealing off all exits. So when I stood in the **high**, it used the **high** to constrain me, and I could not move; when I stood in the **low**, it used the **low** to constrain me, and I could not move. It was all because of its **obdurate, unyielding heart**—no crevice or opening to allow a person to turn or shift.

*"The **pilgrim** became **immovable like a drill**, the **minor demons**’ **power** too weak to **lift** it; the **Jade Emperor** dispatched the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** with spears, swords, knives, and axes—**bearing, lifting, prying, and levering**—yet the **golden gong** remained **coldly unmoved**."* This is precisely *“Heaven generates all things, none sufficient to **nao** (挠) the heart”*—its **shackles** were deep, its **fortress** unbreakable.

The **Golden-Headed Dragon** (亢金龙) said: *“Gazing upon this treasure, it must surely be a **wish-fulfilling** object.”* Its **black heart** mirrored its **wicked intentions**, yet its **authority and magical power** were enough to **ensnare** beings.

If a **gentleman** (君子) were unluckily trapped, he must **hold fast to the principle of moderation and rectitude**, **borrowing the strength of the Monkey and the Ox** (猿引犄角) to escape calamity, **concealing his light and entering its darkness** (韬其明而就其暗). Otherwise, none would avoid **disintegration of limbs** or **loss of life**.

Then the **Golden-Headed Dragon** transformed its horn into a **needle-sharp tip**, sliding it along the **seam of the gong** (钹口合缝), using a **force of a thousand pounds** before it could pierce through.

The *“seam”* (合缝) refers to the **central junction** of the two **gongs**, where their **mouths** open and close. The *“Golden-Headed”* (亢) is neither **flattery** nor **arrogance**, but rather **balanced strength**—neither lowly nor lofty—speaking of **upholding the principle of moderation**, yet its **power surpasses its form**, its **mind as fine as a hair**.

*"The **pilgrim** drilled the **seam** with its horn tip; its body shrank to the size of a **mustard seed**, crouching within the hole to emerge."* This is the **Dao/Way of subtle adaptability and emptiness**, **meticulous research**, **not boasting of its own abilities**, and **relying on the horn**—**discerning the openings within openings**, **treading beyond the heavens** (踏破天外天).

*"It drew out the **Golden Hoop Staff**, smashing the **golden gong**."* With one enlightenment, a thousand illusions dissolved; with one defeat, the **Four Great Elements** were shattered like **minced meat**. How could one rely on the **petty’s Dao/Way**? Even this **old demon** could not help but awaken in terror!

Yet its **ambiguous, black heart** could not be swayed or bent, though it could be **recognized and broken**. As for its **theft of the sayings *“All beings are my kin”** and *“All things are shared with me”***, this was the **ultimate truth of the Dao/Way**, beyond what even **humans and gods** could **ensnare or escape**. Hence, there was the **Post-Heaven Bag** (后天袋) as the **greatest calamity**.

The **demon** declared: *“This place is called **Little Western Heaven** (小西天), for I have attained the **true fruit** (正果), and Heaven bestows upon me this **treasure-hall and precious pavilion**.”* It **claimed to be the **Yellow-Browed Old Buddha** (黄眉老佛), **displaying its powers** to **wager a bet and challenge**, vowing to *“beat you all to death, then go to the **Tathāgata** to fetch scriptures—**the fruit is truly mine!**”* It sought to **make itself the ancestor**, **arrogantly inflating its own greatness**, yet it knew not that it was a **petty thief**, **usurping false titles**.

*"During the battle, the old demon untied its **old white cloth sack** (旧白布搭儿) and **bundled up all the holy ones** (圣众) within it."* Its **rageful heart** surged, and it **dragged many into its net**.

*"Each was bound tightly, no distinction between good and evil—all were cast to the ground."* It sought to **entrap them in its prisons**.

The **Buddha-Dharma** knows **no discrimination**, **no division between good and evil**—it is the **universal love**. Yet now it was twisted into **universal hatred**, turning the **living into instruments of death**. Its **demonic wickedness** was particularly extreme, hence their **great misfortunes**.

Speaking of the **Post-Heaven Bag**, it was the **greatest** of all. It embodied the **meaning of *“All beings are my kin”**, *“All things are shared with me”**, and *“The Buddha-Dharma knows no discrimination, no division between good and evil”***. The **sutras** state: *“If a **Bodhisattva** clings to **self-view**, **person-view**, **living-being-view**, or **life-span-view**, then it is not a **Bodhisattva**.”* How different was this from the **Confucian principle of *“boundless impartiality, neither inward nor outward”**?

If one claims *“The Buddha-Dharma knows no discrimination, no division between good and evil”***, then it **erases the distinctions** between **Yashodhara** (its wife), **Rahula** (its son), and the **filial piety of honoring parents and mourning the dead**—even the **sorrowful deeds** and **teaching of compassion to gods and humans**, all **loyalty, sincerity, filiality, and fraternity** would be **wiped out**. This *“no division between good and evil”* is **evil itself**, hence it is a **false Buddha**.

The **pilgrim** first **freed itself**, then **its Master**, then **Eight Rules** and **Sha Wujing**, then the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** and the **Five Directions’ Jie Di**, then **its horse**, and finally **retrieved its baggage**. Even in the **chaos of calamity**, it still **ranked kin and strangers, honored and humble, noble and base, urgent and delayed**—**ordering them by degree**. This alone was the **essence of the Buddha’s baggage and staff**—how could it be said that *“The Buddha-Dharma knows no discrimination, no division between good and evil”*?

Thus it is said: *“People are important, but the **baggage and staff** are even more important!”* Within the **baggage** were the **passports to pass the gates**, the **brocade and embroidered monastic robes**, the **jewel-encrusted alms bowl**—all **treasures of the Buddha-Dharma**. How could one not treasure them?

“It is said: *‘Your life and your master’s are most critical.* One who reads this may awaken to the truth that those who claim *‘the Buddha knows no distinction, no division between good and evil’* are false Buddhas, destroyers of the Buddha.

*‘When the Pilgrim saw the baggage and staff, he rejoiced greatly, rousing the old demon to battle’*—all for the sake of this baggage and staff. *‘The Pilgrim saw it clearly, but the others did not understand its meaning, and it was all packed inside’*—mixed into the undiscriminating sack of *‘no good, no evil.’* *‘The Pilgrim leapt to the Ninth Heaven, sighing for some time, calming his mind and spirit, questioning his own heart’*—unaware that he despised the empty, rootless arrogance of demons, seeking the Upholder of the Heavenly Magic to quell this great calamity, yet still not reclaiming its true master. Hence it is said:
*‘Before the Dao is complete, monkeys and horses scatter;
Without a steadfast heart and spirit, the Five Phases wither.’*

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Gods Suffer Poisonous Hands, Maitreya Binds the Demons**

The Master of One Awakening said: The Six Classics are all methods for cultivating the heart and governing the world, rooted in the sages and worthies, their essence and vitality flowing through them—illuminating the body and extending its function, encompassing both great and small, yet ultimately not departing from the one true treasure of sincerity. Later, vulgar scholars and false scholars plundered their teachings, seizing fame and gain, their intentions and motives driven only by selfish ambition, forgetting their original purpose. They even stole names and pretense, corrupting moral order, committing good deeds while sowing chaos—there was nothing they would not do. What was meant to save the world became instead a tool for its ruin. Their guilt is beyond measure!

Zhuangzi said, *“The Confucian scholars use the *Poetry* and *Documents* to dig up graves.”* I say that the Confucian scholars use the *Poetry* and *Documents* to extinguish nature and harm life—how different is this from the Yellow-Brow Boy secretly stealing the Buddha’s treasures from the undiscriminating sack, then pretending to be the Buddha and causing mischief? Here, the Immortal Master uses the Yellow-Brow’s false Buddha as a metaphor to expose the harm of false Confucianism, warning against its corruption of the world and human hearts.

When people’s hearts are clouded and unprincipled, only the grace of the sages’ *Poetry* and *Documents* can enlighten and guide them, leading to harmony and salvation. Yet today’s false Confucians borrow the Way of Yao and Shun but follow the deeds of thieves; they claim the words of Confucius and Mencius while pursuing their own predatory ambitions. Their destructive schemes surpass even floods and ferocious beasts. Even the sages could do nothing against them, hence the comment: *“The Great Sage has no recourse.”*

「The reader may say that the False Buddha of *Xiao Leiyin* should be countered by seeking the True Buddha of *Daleiyin* to rectify it—why then does he neglect this and instead engage in the deeds of *Wudang* and *Nicang*? Is this not an unnecessary detour, stumbling and faltering in vain?

Alas! The author’s profound discourse and grand writings on the Way and human hearts are buried in obscurity. The two Immortal Ancestors—one pacifying the Northern realm, the other subduing the *Sizhou* waters—both manifested their powers through taming floods. Yet fierce beasts, venomous dragons, water spirits, and all manner of tortoises, serpents, and dragon generals were not only conquered but also *put to use* by them. Thus, even floods and ferocious beasts are easier to tame.

Tracing their origin from birth to enlightenment, recounting their might in subduing divine beings and mastering supernatural abilities—without these two Ancestors, none could have calmed the chaos. Yet today, not only can they not calm the chaos, but the very generals of the gods are *stripped away* and seized—this is the ultimate evil of false teachings, far worse than floods and ferocious beasts! How could one not weep bitterly at this sight?

*"The Wanderer, weeping before the Functionary, said:*
‘Now I am ashamed to ascend the Celestial Palace, humiliated to stand before the Southern Seas. I dread to ask the Buddha of the origins, and am distressed to behold the Jade Image of the Tathāgata.
Those who were seized—true *Zhenwu* tortoises, serpents, and the Five Dragons—have left me no means to seek salvation. What am I to do?’

Ah, wondrous Immortal Master! Does the Wanderer truly grieve, fear, or feel shame and remorse, shedding tears as such? The deeper sorrow lies in the lamentation that the Heavenly Immortals and the Buddha’s teachings were established to *save the world and deliver from calamity*, yet scholars today *exploit these teachings to bring harm to the world*, seizing their truth while indulging in falsehoods. Even the Bodhisattvas and Tathāgatas have no recourse.

When one reflects on their origins and contemplates their form, the anguish becomes unbearable. How can one endure to see such corruption again?

The sages left their teachings to *guide the wise and transform the ignorant*, to cultivate the body and mind for the benefit of all beings. Yet today, their words are *plundered to gratify desires*, their principles *stolen to nurture deceit*.
Floods can be tamed, but this false tide cannot; ferocious beasts can be subdued, but this venom cannot.
If the *Nishan* and *Sizhou* were to arise today, they would surely *harmonize with the false teachings of Wudang and Sizhou* and find no means to counter them.

Alas! The Wanderer, as a disciple of the Buddha, fears to behold the Tathāgata; yet if the Wanderer were a Confucian scholar, he would be ashamed to ascend the *Xingtan* platform, distressed to hear the *Biyu* bell tolling.

It is not merely a matter of sorrowful lamentation, but rather an urgent warning against the severity of false teachings as a calamity.

That demon, upon seeing the tortoise, serpent, and dragon generals, raged and said:
*“What power do these beings possess?”*
The Four Generals of the Prince of *Taizi* laughed and replied:
*“What means do you have? You can only bully the water monsters of the Huai River.”*
In their unbridled rage and joy, they defile the gods and mock the sages, winning battle after battle, yet all are *seized and stripped away*—how can their harm not surpass that of floods and ferocious beasts?

At this dire and pitiful moment, only the foremost Buddha of the *Extreme Bliss Realm* can open His laughter, uphold the teachings of the world, and point to the true hearts of heaven, earth, and humanity—urging each person to *plant seeds of sincerity* in the fundamental nature, to *strive earnestly for genuine return*, and to *banish external false teachings*, seeking instead the already *shattered gold* of their original truth. This is the true *pillar to steady the raging waves*, the divine staff to crush the venom.

Suddenly, the Wanderer sees *Maitreya* descend, pointing to the *post-heaven sack* as the *sowing sack for humanity*—the foundation of *benevolent heart* and *benevolent governance*, encompassing all phenomena of heaven and earth. It is not something to be *stolen and used to deceive the ruler or mislead the world*.
The *Rangyabar* (狼牙棒) is the *striking mallet of the cosmic drum*—a sacred instrument to *awaken the customs and rouse the deluded*, enlightening the wise, the foolish, the virtuous, and the unprincipled. It is not to be *wielded to harm others or bring suffering to the multitude*.

The way to rectify this is to *pursue sincerity*;
the way to pursue sincerity is as clear as *planting melons*.」

The *sowing of melons yields melons*—the principle of planting roots and cultivating truth. *Maitreya* sows a field of melons and fruits to tempt their thirsty cravings, demonstrating the way to abandon superficiality and embrace reality. The method of action must first restrain and regulate, suppressing their old cunning.

Write the character **"restraint"** (禁) upon the palm, wield it in the hand so that no falsehoods, extravagance, ostentation, or avarice may arise. Attack and retreat in turn. Release restraint and use inducement, gradually drawing them near to truth, then seizing the opportunity to enlighten them; penetrate their core, making them aware of the critical bond between life and *Dao*, thereby subduing them and capturing their hearts. This is the great *pillar to steady the raging waves*’ technique of transforming the melon within, seizing the entrails, and striking at the heart to awaken their minds.

That demon then cries out, *"Master, spare my life!"*—only then does it recognize that life and *Dao* are the most precious of treasures, and the true Master is revealed. Afterward, the *post-heaven sack* and the *striking mallet of the cosmic drum* cannot be wielded in reverse, to harm the world.

Eating the melon’s reality reveals that true learning lies in the *Dao* of life; entering the *sack of Maitreya* reveals that the *sack of the Way* is rooted in one’s own self. Scattered fragments of truth must be gathered into unity; old habits, once abandoned, must be returned to their original source.

The Buddha and the Patriarchs return to *Extreme Bliss* (极乐), the gods each resume their proper stations, the disciples escape calamity and gain freedom, abandoning the *Small Thunder Sound* (小雷音) for the *Great Thunder Sound* (大雷音)—all this is the pursuit of the fundamental truth. Alas! The *yellow-browed* (黄眉) ones borrow the *sack of Maitreya*, which encompasses all phenomena, to become the *abyss of greed* that devours all beings. How tragic! Yet fortunately, the reality of the melon is obtained to reclaim them.

Now, among the *Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist* schools, many *yellow-browed* ones wield the *cosmic drum* and the *sack* together. How can one expect the *Wanderer* to endure such widespread planting of *Eastern Ling* (东陵) and the burden of repeated action?

**The Sixty-Seventh Chapter: Rescuing the Steadfast *Dharma-nature* of the *Tālā* (驼罗) Hermit, Freeing the Pure *Dao-heart* from Defilement**

The text states: *"This book reveals that great concealment does not prevent dwelling in the marketplace, but one must not be corrupted by market vices; detachment from dust does not prevent entering dust, but one must not be stained by worldly traces."* The false *immortals* of the *Wood Immortal Hermitage* (木仙庵) and the pseudo-*Buddhas* of the *Small Thunder Sound* (小雷音), though they appear to have devised their own methods, seem to avoid the world’s clamor and shun the dust—yet they are not the true essence of great concealment.

At the beginning, the *Three Treasures* (三藏) said, *"Let us seek lodging along that path?"* The Wanderer replied, *"The lodging lies ahead."* These words teach one to accept whatever arises and not to precalculate.

The *Immortal Master* (仙师) thus set forth the analogy of *sparse persimmons* (稀柿) and *extreme filth* (极污). The persimmon, once fallen, has just left the "wood" (木) to become the "market" (市). The *Seven Emotions* (七情) are likened to the seven passions of man. Love and attachment are hard to sever, yet they ultimately lead to poisonous harm. Accumulated over time, they become defilement; deep-rooted obstacles become mountains. The *yin-qi* (阴气) breeds into a *serpent’s den* (蟒穴), and the *Kāngzāng* (康庄) path transforms into the *Swine’s Way* (豕途). This is the origin of the *Tālā* Hermit’s *long serpent* (长蛇) that devours people, and the *Seven Emotions Mountain* (七绝山) that blocks the road like a *walled-off boar* (封豕).

*"Tālā"* (驼罗) is the *Sanskrit* term for *Tāla* (陀罗净土), the *Pure Land*. *"Five hundred or more households"* (共有五百多家) refers to the *Arhats* (罗汉), those who dwell there. The *Buddhist canon* (释典) names them *"Arahat"* (阿罗汉), meaning those who have extinguished all passions, capable of receiving universal offerings, untouched by the three realms, far from all evil, and enjoying pure *Dharma-nature* (禅性稳). Yet now, dwelling beside the *sparse persimmons*, they suffer continuous attacks by serpentine demons, their livestock devoured, their men and women in fear and peril—this is the *Dharma-nature* (性) of a neighbor to a *serpent’s den* (蛇窟), the *Pure Land* (净土) turned into a *field of slander* (舌场). How precarious it is, like one drowning or burning, needing urgent rescue!

Only one with great wisdom and great *pillar to steady the raging waves*’ power, such as the *Wanderer* (孙行者), can easily dispel and drive away such calamities, bringing peace to the world. Could those ordinary monks who rot like *spoiled melons* (烂西瓜) or those ordinary Daoists who are *boiled chickens* (落汤鸡) truly stabilize the *Dharma-nature* (禅性) and purify the *Dao-heart* (道心)?

Only the Wanderer’s supreme methods can be relied upon to shoulder this burden—no other can be summoned. Yet if one does not purify oneself and minimize attachments, or if one lingers over gold, silver, or fields, then it is greed and the pursuit of profit, consorting with the market’s vices. Even if one unites in removing harm, it remains an attack by one demon against another—never to be allowed.

Thus, the Wanderer appears to teach and demonstrates that, though he values gold and silver, he does not indulge in market corruption; though he sees fields, he does not fish with the market’s tricks. All this is but the accumulation of virtue.

The market’s heart is full of deceitful schemes, yet it resembles a serpent. The *Dao* scriptures say, *"The serpent of passions sleeps in your heart"*—this is it. Its accumulated habits are such that it seizes cattle and horses, it seizes chickens and geese, it seizes men and women—regardless of size or status, it is well-practiced in devouring them. Its eyes hang like twin torches, revealing hidden profits in the dark; its tongue dances like double hooks, swiftly blocking and misleading on either side. Only until dawn, when the *heavenly heart* (天心) resets, does it hesitate and conceal itself, yet its head and tail remain exposed, unable to escape the discerning gaze of the wise.

When its *qi* (气) is strong, the *soft-shafted spear* (软柄枪) displays boundless crafty tricks; when its path is exhausted, the *great mouth* (巨口) swiftly swallows all in an instant. Ah! How fearsome it is!

The common man fears it, dreading its fangs and jaws;
The perfected one confronts it, as if seeing its lungs and liver.

The perfected one’s body is firm and pure, untainted by grinding or dyeing.
Thus, though he walks through the marketplace with his mind,
He is not swayed by it;
Though he enters the dens of profit,
He is not harmed by them.

The most wondrous lies in the two meanings of *building a bridge in the serpent’s belly* and *changing the boat*:
To consume fat and blood while growing sluggish flesh—
What compares to an empty stomach harnessing the eastern rainbow,
Accumulating virtue through beneficial deeds?
To hoard wealth and fatten the phantom’s back—
What compares to bankruptcy and building a vessel of compassion,
Accumulating virtue through giving and relief?

Extinguishing the evil karma of cravings,
Binding the universal cause for universal liberation—
Fear and terror vanish,
Each fulfills its nature,
Merit and virtue complete,
All find peace in their essence—
What joy surpasses this?

Henceforth, with sincere heart and empty vessel,
Transforming form and cultivating the Way:
Expanding the heart-mind of ten thousand ages,
Long-blocked alleys now restored to their ancient paths;
Breaking free from the entanglements of a thousand years,
Accumulating filth like the Gourd Ridge,
Yet all attain enlightenment together.

This is as the Inner Canon of the Mysterious Sovereign states:
*"Facing phenomena while forgetting them,
Not sinking into the six demonic magics;
Dwelling in dust yet transcending it,
Not falling into the transformations of myriad entanglements."*

Thus the poem concludes:
*"All desires and dusty emotions are severed,
Peaceful and unobstructed, bowing to the Lotus Platform."*

Ah!

Ah! Marvelous indeed—
Wherever the Lotus Platform is glimpsed, each person’s heart becomes a Pure Land;
Where the Divine Flower Treasury is revealed, every household finds a path to the Western Heaven.

To transcend the Gourd Ridge’s filth and reach the Lotus Platform—
Who is pure, who defiled?
Who is blocked, who unobstructed?
Only the individual may awaken to this.

Yet why does the Camel’s Horn Village fear the serpent and not simply depart?
Why does the Gourd Ridge’s accumulated filth remain, its trees uncut?
Perhaps it is that the land has no harsh governance,
And the roots of karmic affliction are not easily eradicated!

---
**Sixty-Eighth Chapter**
*The Tang Monk Discusses Past Lives in the Land of Vermilion and Purple*
*The Monkey King’s Three Broken Arms*
*A Disciple Awakens:* This passage, up to the seventy-first, elucidates the cultivation of the Great Dao of Refining the Golden Elixir. Only Zhang Boduan’s *Awakening to Reality* captures its essence—one should follow his teachings with reverence, as the concluding section on *"The True Person’s Rustic Robe"* makes clear.

The heading explicitly declares *"Land of Vermilion and Purple,"*
Connoting the nobility of vermilion and purple,
Yet inverting to suggest that none surpasses the authenticity of Boduan.

The Lacquered Sage speaks of *"The Ox Adorned in Brocade,"*
The Master Confucius views *"Wealth and Honor as Fleeting Clouds,"*
Zilu values *"The Noble’s Rank Above Silk-Beams,"*
And Jin Ping warns of *"High Chariots and Four Horses Bringing Ruin."*
Chen the Recluse writes:
*"Though Purple Avenues teem with vain display,
Vermilion robes, though noble, pale beside poverty."*

From antiquity, sages have given profound counsel—
Yet how is it that people read ten thousand volumes and a thousand scriptures
And still fail to recognize the letters?

The Monkey King immediately roars in awakening:
*"Master, you do not recognize the three great characters—'Land of Vermilion and Purple'!"*

For vermilion and purple dust and glory are but illusions, dream-bubbles;
Imperial capitals and royal domains are but transient echoes of Zen.

「To know what comes next, one must observe the past;
The past, viewing the future, is like the future viewing the past.

Thus, the Tripitaka traces back to the Three Sovereigns and reaches the Five Emperors,
From yielding to others to waging conquests;
Contending for succession, merging and struggling for dominance;
Alternating between governance and chaos, life’s span stretched yet unequal,
Only to finally converge in the dream of the Tang King.

Alas! Within the winding, circuitous discourse,
Lies an infinite lament of sorrowful, profound truths.

Just as the yellow apricot flags atop the city walls,
Flutter wildly in the wind—
If not for old Sun Wukong’s clear vision,
Even if you master celestial lore, know geography, and debate *yin-yang*,
Or if you govern the realm and found states,
Send books to the *Yin Du* underworld,
Extend lives through alchemical arts,
All these efforts are but the work of *"Weizheng the Omen."*

Far better is to worship the Buddha,
Take the *Mahayana Sutras* of the Three Baskets,
And ascend to heaven by transcending the sufferings of karma!

*The Fa Yuan Zhu Lin* states:
*"Though the peacock boasts a splendid form,
It cannot fly as far as the wild crane;
Though vermilion robes carry wealth and honor,
They cannot match the virtue of renouncing the world."*

The kings of vermilion and purple,
Though adorned with splendor, face peril in their bodies;
Though their robes hold wealth and honor, their hearts ache with suffering—
Lamenting that no one comes to save them,
Yet they do not suffer the same fate as the Tang King,
Who dreamt his way into hell?

Those who gather at the *"Hui Tong Hall"*—
Meet without appointment, align without plan;
Ancient and modern worlds differ not,
Yet their boundaries share the same rules.

A king wears vermilion and purple while feasting on *guanglu* honors,
While common folk chase after food and fame, seeking profit and name.
Both share the same cravings of mouth and body,
Yet both fall ill unto the marrow of life’s vitality.

Thus, when the Eighth Rule hears of wine, rice, silk, and brocade,
Or fragrant foods, he cannot help but drool and enter the market.

When the Pilgrim sees the royal edict calling for worthy men,
And lands of vermilion and purple,
He cannot help but joyfully rush to serve as a royal physician.

In truth, wandering east to west, pursuing worldly gains is but a fleeting illusion;
One must know that bowing to lift the royal edict,
And accepting fate to heal the realm, is also of utmost importance.

The Eighth Rule seeks food and gains renown,
Yet unexpectedly, he ponders the royal physician’s edict—
Grandfathers, fathers, sons, and grandsons,
Nurses and elders—
All vie for the empty title in unison.

The Pilgrim, though jesting, acts with earnestness,
As if he truly holds the king’s position—
Revered and honored, obeyed and worshipped,
With ranks arrayed and bowing in procession—
In moments, he becomes a puppet.

For any true hero,
Their words are sharp and striking beyond measure—
Thus, if the vulgar do not flinch, it is not the mark of a hero;
For one with genuine wisdom,
Their actions are swift yet deliberate, not reckless—
Thus, if the first move is not refused, it is not true wisdom.

This is how the Pilgrim steps forward with a stern voice,
And how the king is startled into submission—
*"Dismiss him!"*

What truly startles the listener,
Is not *"stepping forward with a stern voice,"*
But *"a thousand years without relief."*

If one does not cultivate the Dao,
Even if their schemes for wealth and honor succeed,
It is but a ghostly, fleeting existence—
A life bound to death.

Born with sickness, dying from sickness;
Living as a sickly mortal, dying as a suffering ghost;
Through countless kalpas of rebirth,
When will this suffering end?
A thousand years without relief—
If spoken of in terms of *wànjié* rebirth,
Does it not startle the ignorant?

The depths of wisdom lie not in *"hanging threads to diagnose pulses,"*
But in *"each of the three fine hairs measuring twenty-four feet."*

*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*, *The Classic of Difficulties*, *The Fundamentals of Herbal Medicine*, and *Pulse Decisions*
Serve only to cure momentary ailments,
And prolong a single life.

If medical skill is commonplace,
Then the three fine hairs are likened to the Three Passes—
*Tian Guan* at the hand, *Di Zhu* in the heart—
And the five movements correspond to *jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.

To align the three fine hairs with the twenty-four *qi* of the seasons,
And to harmonize the three conditions with the seventy-two *hou* of fate—
This is to treat diseases spanning thousands of years;
A grand masterpiece of medical wisdom—
Yet the world struggles to grasp its profundity!

Thus, the Daoist sage concludes with this instruction:
*"The heart holds secret prescriptions to heal the realm,
Within it lies the wondrous formula for eternal life."*

I once visited Jingyang,
And inscribed this couplet at the Temple of the Medicine King:
*"How many commoners’ afflictions exist?
Drink it, eat it—
Better seek the Daoist’s elixirs for true cures;
The world’s incurable maladies in countless forms—
Names and profits—
What compares to the white clouds atop the mountain?"*

The compiler, it seems, must recognize the phrase *"Zhūzǐ Guó"* (Jade-Purple Realm) and be willing to shatter the butterfly dream of the mortal world—then proceed to read this book together.

**Chapter Sixty-Ninth**
*The Heart’s Nighttime Alchemy*
*The King’s Feast on Demonic Heresies*

A sage once said:
*"Floating glory and vain pursuits—
A dream steeped in yellow millet;
Worldly tastes and dusty bonds—
Swift as sparks on stone."*

Men call this the common talk of old monks,
Saying that within ritual teachings lies a place of joy.
Yet in truth, one’s life is but restless toil—
Clutching wind, embracing shadows—
And in an instant, eternal slumber descends.
From ancient times to now, how many have truly awakened?

Lu Zong said:
*"Seeking fame and fortune births hell’s torment,
Ritual propriety kills in the prison of the heavens."*
Truly, this awakens the dream and shatters delusion!

The Daoist sage’s work here
Specially highlights the pure night’s sincere heart,
Pointing to the path of awakening for self-recognition.
For to cultivate the Dao, one must first purify the heart;
To purify the heart, one must first dispel illness;
To dispel illness, one must first know its roots.

The ancient divine physicians,
Gazing at the lofty walls, their skill astounding the two young men.
Hanging threads to diagnose pulses—
Not absurd, but rather describing
Deep contemplation leading to penetration,
Silent cultivation reaching divine insight.

As birds have fixed mates, so too their cries when separated;
As humans cannot have one polarity dominate, so too illness arises from imbalance.
The marvelous prescriptions of medicine—
The blind and foolish cannot grasp them.

The Medical Officer said:
*"The eight hundred and eighty flavors—
Not all are used,"*
Seeing that their use cannot be exhaustive.

The Wanderer said:
*"Medicine does not cling to formulas,
Thus it fully conquers,"*
Seeing that the formula’s essence lies in its application.

*"Eight hundred and eighty flavors,"*
Clarifying the number two-eight.
Two-eight refers to what *The Parametric Concordance* calls
Nine Returns, Seven Circulations, Eight Reunions, Six Residences.
Nine and seven are yang numbers, combining into sixteen—
The full essence of a man’s true *jing*.
Eight and six are yin numbers, combining into fourteen—
The arrival of a woman’s *tian gui*.
Taking the moon’s waxing and waning as symbols,
Thus it is also said:
*"The waxing phase—eight of *Dui*,
The waning phase—eight of *Gen*—
Their combined essence forms the *Kan* and *Kun* bodies."*
*"Two-eight corresponds to one *jin*,
The *Yijing*’s unshaken truth."*

*The Awakening to Reality* says:
*"When the moon first hangs half-lit in the sky,
Already the dragon’s roar and tiger’s growl resound.
Now is the time to refine the two-eight,
Within a single hour, the elixir is complete."*
Speaking of yin-yang union,
The opportune moment for alchemical refinement.

Thus the Wanderer says:
*"When night is still, we best prepare the medicine."*
*"By midnight, the streets lie empty, all sounds hushed,
Eight Rules said, ‘Brother, hurry—let’s act early.’"*
All pointing to the urgency of the two-eight’s timing.

Taking *dàhuáng* (great yellow), the utmost yin;
And *bādòu* (croton seed), the utmost yang.
*"Dà"*—one, *rén* (person);
*"Bā"*—one, *jǐ* (self).
Person and self unite, essence complete—
Yin and yang harmonized, the medicine is ready.

Thus Eight Rules said:
*"Eight hundred and eighty flavors—
Just these two suffice,
Truly capable of reviving the dead, defying heaven’s will,
And becoming the complete elixir."*

Earlier, the Three Treasures answered the king:
*"Three stubborn brutes—none know the nature of the medicine."*
Now, the Sand Monk is well-acquainted with *dàhuáng*’s cold nature,
Eight Rules deeply versed in *bādòu*’s heat—
Yet if one clings only to the properties of the herbs,
Even knowing them, how can one heal the realm?
Still, they remain unenlightened.

The Wanderer said:
*"My brother, you do not know."*

The Wanderer said:
*"You too do not know."*

He spoke of these two flavors repeatedly as *"unknown"* to urge careful study of their subtleties—one must not grasp at superficial traces alone.

In the text, *"spun fine"*—when spoken of medicine, yet not just of medicine.

*"Bai cao shuang"* (Hundred Herbs’ Frost) takes the harmonizing of the earthen tripod;
*"Long ma niao"* (Dragon-Horse Urine) draws from the treasures of the Water Palace.

*"Guo hui"* (Kettle Ash) and *"jin zhi"* (Golden Juice)—their meaning is clear.

When stirred together as *"San Jiu"* (Three Nines), it gathers the Five Phases and divides the Three Realms.

Named *"Wu Jin Dan"* (Black Gold Pill), to reveal the essence of the Golden Elixir—the sovereign’s secret remedy lies here.

Ah! How wondrous!

The Immortal Master feared the world might remain ignorant, so within the medicine’s ingredients, he embedded six hidden marvels, each laden with meaning.

*"Laoya"* (Old Crow) is the yin of the *Lǐ* (Trigrams: *Lǐ* 离), taking its *qi*;
*"Lǐ yú"* (Carp) is the yang of the *Kǎn* (坎), drawing its essence.

*"Wangmu fen"* (Queen Mother’s Powder) is the yin-earth *jǐ* (己);
*"Laojun hui"* (Laozi’s Ash) is the yang-earth *wù* (戊).
*"Toujin san kuài"* (Three Headcloths) gathers the three blossoms of the crown;
*"Long xu wu gen"* (Five Dragon Whiskers) encircles the five radiant yangs.

Taking the body’s *qi* and essence, combining *wù* and *jǐ* to form the *gui* (圭), this is the marvelous Dao of Three-Five.

These are formless substances, arising from the void—beyond the ken of ignorant physicians. Hence it is said:
*"This is something the world cannot possess."*

The vulgar claim this remedy excels in curing false illnesses, unaware that common speech conceals profound principles, not deceit.

Even ordinary medicine uses rootless water, yet it too descends from heaven;
If the Dragon King sneezes and spits his essence, it is no ordinary rainwater.

As the Mud Pill Master said:
*"Saliva and spittle, precious fluids—
Only they can serve as the ladder to ascent."*

When the essence transforms into ambrosial dew,
Three cups descend the Three Nines,
Like the unceasing sound of a waterwheel,
Piercing the Three Passes—
And the root of illness vanishes.

This remedy heals the realm like a god—
Why not record it on bamboo and silk,
So all under heaven, in future ages, may take and nourish themselves?
Yet it is kept secret—why?

The Practitioner spoke: *"The king is indeed a great sage of virtue and power,"*
*"I shall assist you and stand by him."*

This wisdom is not lightly given—
Only to those of true virtue and power may it be entrusted.

The Ancestor said:
*"Gain a worthy disciple yet fail to pass on the Heavenly Treasure,
And pass it to the unworthy, the Seventh Patriarch suffers."*

Examine the past: the Purple Yang True Person thrice passed it to the unworthy,
And thrice met Heaven’s retribution—
A lesson to be heeded!

How could it be openly inscribed on bamboo and silk?
Thus, the Eighth Precept spoke of *"horse in the medicine"*,
Yet ceased to reveal it afterward;
The Practitioner, in anger at his concealment,
Suddenly invoked *"the Horsehoe Herb"* as a cover—
All to show that such secrets must not be recklessly divulged,
Lest calamity be invited.

The later text foreshadows the **Tài Suì**’s resolution of the Golden Bell,
The welcome of the Golden Saint,
And the true method for refining the Golden Elixir.
Yet without knowing the cause of its dispersion,
Or recognizing the marvel of its return,
One cannot grasp the king’s words at the feast,
Which reveal the root of the *"lost and scattered"* affliction.

The **Black** is the essence of the *Lì* hexagram—
It has its primordial mate,
But when separated, it does not return.
The **Black** alone, without pair,
Though it can internally nourish the Five Spirits,
Cannot externally harmonize with the One Qi.
It dispels only later-acquired diseases within the body,
Yet fails to retreat the original external afflictions.

Thus, even the *"Black-Gold Elixir"* is not yet the pure Yang,
The true crimson-gold Elixir.

The king said:
*"At the very time of the Duan’yáng festival,
In the Sea-Pomegranate Pavilion, I watched the Dragon Boat races.
Suddenly, a gust of wind arose,
And a demon appeared—
It called itself the **‘Rival Tài Suì’**,
Dwelling in the **Qílín Mountain’s Xiè Zhì Cave**,
And had seized the Golden Saint Palace to take it away."*

The **Duanwǔ** festival marks the throat of Heaven—
A sudden wind rising,
The Six Yangs first encounter One Yin, forming the *Gòu* hexagram.
The *Gòu*—Heaven’s wind—
(□ hexagram diagram omitted);
The gradual onset of *Bō*—
The root of *Fù*.

In a man’s body,
It is like first taking a woman and craving her child,
Or racing dragon boats and delighting in frivolity—
Hence the saying: *"Riding in the Flower Garden Sea-Pomegranate Pavilion,
Engaging in Dragon Boat races."*

At this moment,
The true gold of the Six Yangs of the *Qián* body is broken,
And sinks into the *Kūn* earth.
Then the Six Yins of the *Kūn* earth,
In turn, obtain the true gold and become *Fù*—
Earth’s thunder.
(□ hexagram diagram omitted),
The reverse of *Bō*—
The end of *Gòu*.

When thunder erupts from the earth,
The spirit of **Gōu Máng** manifests.
*"It calls itself the **‘Rival Tài Suì’**"*—
As if offering true gold and praying to it,
Is it not a **"Rival"**?

The **Qílín** is the beast of benevolence,
Its nature is to love all things;
The **Xiè Zhì** is the divine sheep,
Its wisdom discerns deceit—
It embodies the heart of love and hatred.

The **Tài Suì** lurks within,
And seizes the Golden Saint Palace—
Then I lose what I love,
And exchange it for what I do not love, breeding sorrow;
I gain what I hate,
And exchange it for what I do not hate, breeding doubt.
The maladies of sorrow and doubt arise from this—
Not the essence of the benevolent who do not sorrow,
Or the wise who are not confused.

Yet after years of sorrow and doubt,
After three years of stagnant accumulation,
A single dose of the **Líng Dān Elixir** can clear the passage;
If the **Tài Suì** is subdued and the Golden Saint welcomed back,
The method requires threefold folding—
It cannot be easily attained.

Avoiding the Maze Tower cannot keep evil at bay,
For one who flees the true south
Cannot ensure the evil’s departure.

Instead, one must recognize it—
Only when recognizing its nature
Does one know the disease’s root,
And can refine the medicine to cure the illness
And bring peace to the realm.

Hence it is said:
*"To pacify the realm, first know the king’s affliction;
To uphold the Dao, remove the heart of love and hatred."*

The *"king"* refers to the **Heart Sovereign**;
The *"heart of love and hatred"* is the **Sovereign’s Heart**.

**Chapter Seventy: The Demon’s Jewel Sets Off Smoke and Sand Fires; Tripitaka’s Disciple Steals the Purple Gold Bell**

Tripitaka’s son said: The Dao of the Golden Elixir is the *Yijing*’s Way.
*Qian* and *Kun* are its gateways,
*Kan* and *Li* its wondrous applications,
*Guà* and *Fù* its transformative mechanisms.

*Guà* must inevitably reach *Pǐ*,
*Pǐ* must inevitably reach *Bó*,
*Bó* at its extreme must return to *Fù*,
*Fù* must return to *Tài*.

Yin and yang wax and wane, cycling endlessly—
This is the "having come, having gone" spoken of in the text.

For those of great cultivation, first possessing a pair of enlightened eyes,
They must strike with fierce resolve—
Lest he return to the Flayed-Skin Pavilion.

Only by secretly penetrating the currents
Can one make the currents follow me,
Acting at the opportune moment,
Stealing the Purple Gold Bell in reverse,
Welcoming back the Golden Saint,
Perfecting the *Qian* essence,
And transcending the mundane.

The "Purple Bell" is the primordial true-yi treasure,
Mingled as one *qi*,
Divided into the Three Primordials—
Every person possesses it fully.

Yet at the moment of *Guà*,
It suddenly vanishes.

Like a ruler unable to secure internal peace,
Summoning external chaos,
Causing the nation to sink into doubt—
If not for wise strategies and grand talent,
Plotting recovery,
Merely hiding in a demon-avoiding cave
Will never truly repel the evil.

Seeking the palace maidens three times over—
How could this not hasten the nation’s ruin?

At the royal banquet, one speech reveals the disease’s root;
In the drink, the practitioner extinguishes the fire,
Clarifying the elixir’s principles.
This is to diagnose the illness and prescribe the remedy—
A display of masterful governance.

Such power is the key to unlocking the path of life and death,
A great Dao passed down by the enlightened master.

In the verses:
*"For the tripod’s furnace,"*
*"Gathering the tortoise and hare,"*
*"Harvesting yin and yang,"*
*"Awakening the Mystic Pass,"*
*"Moving the Heavenly Ganges,"*
*"Shifting the Dipper’s handle,"*
*"Retreating the furnace, advancing the fire,"*
*"Drawing lead, adding mercury,"*
*"Concentrating the Five Phases,"*
*"Harmonizing the Four Symbols,"*
*"Returning the Two *Qi*,"*
*"Uniting the Three Families"*—
Each word is the quintessence of the elixir’s alchemical fire and timing,
All pointing to the same Purple Bell.

The *Tài Suì* is fundamentally *Kun* earth,
Yet obtains *Qian* gold—
Already *Fù*.
But clinging to the female consort to seek *Guà*,
This is *Fù* returning to *Guà*.

Thus, the *Tài Suì* shakes the Purple Bell,
Releasing smoke and fire as harm,
Releasing flying sand as harm—
Though called a "strategy," it is truly demonic.

The king loses *Qian* gold and sinks into *Kun* earth—
Already *Guà*.
Yet, not forgetting the Golden Saint,
He resolves to welcome him back—
This is *Guà* returning to *Fù*.

Thus, the practitioner acts freely, shifting form to steal,
Changing "having come, having gone" into theft—
Though called a "strategy," it is truly Tripitaka’s disciple.

"Having come, having gone" is the natural flow of Heaven’s principle.
Those who study the Dao must, within this flow,
Seek out the marvelous method:
*"One immortal sends a five-colored celestial robe
To adorn the Golden Saint’s palace."*

Only by opening the "Dharma-eye of having gone without coming"
Can one enter the Dao and attain truth.

Thus, the practitioner:
First transforms into a fire-hawk soaring to the heavens,
Second into a grasshopper descending to the earth,
Third into a Daoist acolyte dwelling among mortals—
Piercing through past and present, above and below,
And striking down "having come, having gone" with a single blow.

*"The battle scroll is hidden in the Three Treasures’ bosom—
Do not let the king see it."*
What words are written within?
Some truths cannot be put into words,
And must remain secret—
This is the marvel of striking down "having come, having gone."

Yet how can one strike down the natural flow of Heaven’s principle?
Is this not deceiving the world?
No—striking down is striking to life.
Striking down means "having come, having gone";
Not striking down means "neither coming nor going."

Thus, neither coming nor going
Still does not depart from the form of having come and gone.

The practitioner strikes down to achieve the void,
Yet transforms again into existence—
*"When existence is true, it becomes illusion;
When nothingness departs, it enters the middle.
Existence and nothingness neither stand,
Inside and outside are all emptiness."*

Ah! Marvelous!

---

A pair of golden bells, bright and clear—
two souls bound as husband and wife,
matched and entwined, gazing like rings in a chain.
If one can pierce through this thing with the Dao’s insight,
it is the key to subduing demons and reclaiming the Sage.

The practitioner boldly enters the *Bōpí Tíng* (Shedding-Skin Pavilion),
ignoring the demon king’s questions,
displaying them upon his arm,
playing with them within the rites of propriety—
thus arises the marvel of effortless coming and going,
the subtle, perfect penetration of the Dao’s workings.

Though the practitioner appears to manifest "having come, having gone,"
in truth, he is "neither coming nor going."
Though he seems a trusted general of the Great King,
in truth, he is a trusted general of the Golden Sage—
yet he remains the Great King’s trusted general.
Stealing the golden bells is the secret technique
of the Sage’s subordinate to restore them.

Three golden bells:
Fire is the *shén* (spirit),
Smoke is the *qi*,
Sand is the *jīng* (essence).
When moved and shaken,
smoke, fire, and sand disperse as demons.
When still and embracing the void,
golden fire merges in the palace and congeals as the elixir.

This treasure is found in every home,
yet it fell into the demon’s grasp through the *gǔ* (fortuitous encounter) of the queen,
not originally belonging to the fiend.
The way to reclaim it
must still pass through stealing from the demon’s hand.
Thus, the loss of the bells stems from the *gǔ*,
and their recovery must also arise from the *gǔ*.

If not for the bond of husband and wife,
their mutual joy and delight—
if he did not take and hide the bells with her,
he could never act.
This is why it is said:
*"The thief in disguise steals as a husband."*

The Golden Sage’s palace declares:
*"‘Shared pillow, entwined bed—
the fate of past lives.’*
And thus the golden bells are tricked out,
entrusted to her keeping.
Again it says:
*"‘I have rejoiced with the Great King,
shared his pleasures.’"*
It feigns the demon’s burning rage,
to deceive the *jīnglíng* (spirits and essences).
The practitioner seizes the opportunity,
lightly snatching the three golden bells—
all done with true method.

Most wondrous is *"seizing the opportunity"*—
*"‘Stay beside me, and when the chance arises,
steal my treasure.’"*
The golden bells were entrusted as tokens of a husband’s joy,
and to steal them is to take what belongs to the husband-wife union
as one’s own—
to grasp the transformation of Heaven and Earth’s Dao.
Without seizing the opportunity, it cannot be obtained.
Yet one must deeply know the subtleties,
calmly and patiently perceive them,
not through crude haste or recklessness.

There follows the tale of *"one who does not know the peril,
who tugs at cotton—
pulling forth smoke, fire, and yellow sand,
disturbing the demon king"*—
to show why such treasures are hard to gain yet easy to lose.
The Immortal Master further uses the demon’s mouth
to repeat *"‘Search carefully’"*—
a reminder to the scholar.

The Great King and the Golden Sage’s palace,
are truly husband and wife—
truly, for in one *gǔ* (encounter),
they suddenly fall into calamity,
separated in an instant,
*"turning cleverness into folly."*
The *Tàisuì* (Great Age) and the Golden Sage’s palace,
are falsely husband and wife—
falsely, yet in one *gǔ*,
they become treasure, returning to the realm of possibility,
*"playful deception turns to truth."*

These closing words are profound.
Scholars, search carefully.

**The 71st Episode: The Practitioner Feigns a Name to Subdue the Monster-Tiger, Guanyin Manifests to Suppress the Demon King**

A disciple said: The *"Qiāo Yáo Gē"* (Song of the Divine Stems) states,
*"‘Crosswise and upright, no obstruction—
stillness is non-action, movement is form.’"*
Common folk do not grasp its meaning,
saying *"‘stillness is non-action’"* is the Dao,
while *"‘movement is form’"* is not.
Yet they do not know:
stillness without movement, movement without stillness—these are mere things;
stillness within movement, movement within stillness—this is the spirit.

Again it says:
*"‘Wine is a fine friend, flowers a companion;
in the flower streets and willow lanes, seek the True Person—
the True Person appears only among the flowers.’"*
And again:
*"‘Only through wine and flowers does one awaken to eternal life—
drink wine, wear flowers, and the spirits and demons weep.’"*
*"The spirits and demons weep"*—
the six bandits and three corpses of the ghostly realm,
no longer able to rage.

The ancient Buddhas asked:
*"‘Do you know the *lǎopó* (Old Wife) Dharma?
Do you know the *píkēzi* (Skin-Shell) Dharma?’"*
Again it is said:
*"‘The great matter beneath the *jiāshā* (robe) is unclear—most bitter!
The great matter beneath the *qúnchāi* (woman’s ornaments) is unclear—even more bitter!’"*
All speak of the profound truth of *"movement is form."*

The opening lines of this chapter:
*"‘Form is emptiness, emptiness is form—
if one truly penetrates the Dharma of form and emptiness,
why bother refining cinnabar and sulfur?’"*
This is the same meaning.

Scholars who do not carefully search
instead see it as foolishness,
not knowing the wondrous workings within foolishness—
beyond the grasp of mere cleverness.

The practitioner transforms as a foolish fly,
yet the demon cannot discern his traces—
*"‘Subtle and perfect penetration,
deeply unrecognizable—
great wisdom as foolishness.’"*

This marvel of the golden bells
cannot be understood without a true master’s whispered instruction.
The practitioner, standing by the queen’s ear,
softly calls:
*"‘Again feign the rites of husband and wife to lure him in,
so I may slip away and act.
Do not fear—I will find another way to save you.’"*
This is the key to secret transmission by ear.

First, as husband and wife,
the golden bells are gained but not recognized.
Second, as husband and wife,
the golden bells are understood and may be seized.
Two clear instances of husband and wife,
yet with the marvel of reversed and repeated transformations.

The queen hears this,
startled and doubtful—
like one who hears the Dao from the earth
and is met with skepticism,
thinking it mere ghost talk.
The practitioner says:
*"‘I am neither human nor ghost—
now I have transformed into a foolish little fly.’"*
Ah!
Marvelous!

In other chapters, the practitioner feigns the form of a fly—
his usual technique.
Here, the transformation into a fly
is the very truth of the *biànxìng* (shape-shifting).
Neither spirit nor ghost—just a fly.
The golden elixir’s enlightenment is shown
when the fly hums in response.

The queen said, *"Do not bewitch me with your sorcery!"*
Only when she was held in the queen’s grasp did she begin to understand and no longer doubt—
this was the very essence of *jiéyīng* (embryonic coalescence) taking root.

Master Sanfeng declared:
*"Open the door, I’ll tell you—
without wine or flowers, the Dao cannot be spoken."*

Master Qiu Chuji said:
*"Drink wine, eat meat,
yet guard against the allure of smoke and flowers to curb lust."*

For wine dissolves all obstacles—
the Dao does not forbid it,
so the practitioner said:
*"Drinking wine is the highest path."*

*Chūnjiāo*—this is the flower.
Spring is the Flower Festival,
*jiāo* is the flower’s grace—
all mere illusion.

*"The practitioner transforms into her likeness,
serving beside her—
now the moment arrives to strike."*

This is the hidden principle within flowers,
the true secret of seizing the celestial opportunity.

*"The false Chūnjiāo stands beside her, holding the cup,
saying: ‘Great King and Queen, tonight you must exchange cups—
a double-happiness goblet!’"*

The queen and the demon king spoke only of conjugal matters,
their words thick with passion—
the king’s bones softened, his limbs weakened,
yet he could not touch her.

All this was real—
the very purpose of *"guarding against smoke and flowers to curb lust."*

When husband and wife unite,
the primordial treasure naturally manifests within them.

But how could the treasure in his waist reach my hands?
It must be seized when he is lost in ecstasy,
unable to resist—
only then can the opportunity be seized.

Thus the practitioner transformed into three monstrous forms
to assault his body,
while the demon lord, unaware, exposed his shame—
the golden bells were freed.

The false Chūnjiāo, waiting beside them,
observed carefully—
thus the moment was seized.

This was a method with precise timing,
most wondrous and divine,
a secret transmission from master to disciple—
as *Wù Zhēn* says:
*"With *Gù* and *Gòu*, the transformations unfold—
who says the Golden Elixir cannot succeed?"*

Once the golden bells were seized,
the false was abandoned for the true—
the Golden Saint Queen would naturally reunite,
and the method of returning the External Elixir was thus demonstrated.

If one seeks the treasure in the body alone,
it fails to grasp the ultimate truth of *yīn-yáng* reversal and harmony.

Thus the practitioner again called himself *"External Grandfather,"*
demanding, *"Return my Golden Saint Queen!"*—
this was to illustrate the principle.

This Dao is originally a transmission beyond scripture,
so the queen’s words *"external instruction"* clarify its meaning—
do not dismiss it as vulgar jest,
but recognize its profound intent.

After obtaining it, nourishment and protection were essential,
for danger and risk must be guarded against—
thus war was invoked as a metaphor.

War is perilous, a matter of life and death.
Only by maintaining *femininity* without *masculinity*
can one preserve it without loss.

The practitioner said:
*"Two and three cycle as six—
my femininity, your masculinity."*

For *masculinity* leads to loss;
*femininity* leads to gain.

The demon king relied on his shaking bells to assert dominance,
unaware that he had been outmaneuvered by one who guarded *femininity*—
his presence flickered between existence and nonexistence;
*masculinity* was impossible to grasp.

The practitioner, guarding *femininity* while shaking the bells,
unwittingly violated the precepts of the self-sovereign—
his essence flickered between presence and absence,
*femininity* was no easier to maintain.

To transcend the names of existence and nonexistence,
to erase the traces of *yīn* and *yáng*,
this is the sacred form of Guanyin’s boundless freedom.

*"Only the cry rang through the void:
‘Sun Wukong, I have arrived!’"*
Was this not the empty void of the *Lingbeng*’s purity,
where smoke and fire instantly vanished?

The Golden-Haired Mastiff returned to its origin,
the purple golden bells restored to their source;
the arrow shot at the sparrow was self-inflicted,
the wind torn apart was the destruction of its own young.

Disaster arises from oneself and is self-remedied—
the Mastiff bore no blame.

Just as the ultimate Dao of the Golden Elixir:
loss comes from oneself, gain comes from oneself—
thus it is said:
*"Who can free the golden bells from the Mastiff’s neck?
Ask the one who tied them."*

This is the true transmission of Master Zhuyou,
revealed at the time of the Golden Saint’s return to the palace,
to demonstrate its essence and clarify the doctrine.

The character *"宗"* (ancestral lineage) with *"木"* (wood) added,
piercing through the Golden Saint’s body—
when wood and metal unite in *Gòu*,
five-colored light emerges—
this is the true ancestral lineage.

All under heaven, in future generations,
should inherit and uphold it.

Wearing it for three years,
removing it for one day—
only then could husband and wife reunite,
*femininity* and *masculinity* remain in harmony,
*yin* and *yang* preserve their proper order,
and the complete meaning of the Golden Elixir be fulfilled—
thus the great man’s purpose is accomplished.

What use are fleeting red and purple glories?
Hence it is said:
*"With fate fulfilled, doubts and ailments washed away,
with thoughts extinguished, the heart naturally at peace."*

**Chapter 72: The Spider Silk Cave—Seven Emotions Obscuring the True Nature**
**The Filth-Rinsing Spring—Eight Precepts Losing Form**

Master Wù Yīzǐ said:
The earlier lines *"washed away"* and *"thoughts extinguished"*
seem to introduce the themes of *"Spider Silk"* and *"Filth-Rinsing."*
Readers may mistakenly take the Seven Emotions as joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire,
thus losing sight of their true origin.

Eight Precepts losing form means failing to wash away filth entirely—
one must strive for absolute nakedness,
emptiness of all concerns,
and purity beyond all stains,
only then achieving self-perfection—
this seems correct but is not.

*The Cāntóng Zhì* states:
*"Discernment through the viscera’s laws,
inner vision clouded by thought.
The Dark Path rejects the Nine-One,
turbulence corrupts the primordial embryo.
Countless arts abound—
thousands upon thousands."*

Master Zhōnglí Wēng said:
*"Tears, saliva, semen, breath, blood, and sweat—
seven kinds of essence, all yin.
If these are used as elixir materials,
how can one ascend to the Jade Capital?"*

「The worldly folk arise from the realm of *business* and *perception*,
yet also depart through the same.
When the one *yang* flees, though the form be that of a man,
the body is entirely *yin*—
not merely are the seven true essences all *yin*,
the five *zàng* and six *fǔ* are also *yin* without *yang*.

If one seeks to cultivate only these *yin* essences within the *yang*,
it is *yin* without its counterpart—
like a hen brooding an egg,
hoping to hatch a child,
yet achieving nothing.
What is hatched instead
are moths and caterpillars of strange kind—
such as the *yin*-toxic creatures in this tale:
the bees, ants, and clams,
not the true offspring of one’s original nature—
how could one not lose sight of their true source?

Even worse are those who grasp but a trifle of *yin-yang* principles,
yet fail to comprehend the true *yin-yang* correspondence—
they recklessly assume that consorting with women and gathering *yin* essence
to refine *yin* further,
leaving their bodies or even their lives behind,
is most pitiable!

This is the root of the errors in the "misguided origin" and "losing form."

The opening verse reads:
*"The Three Treasures parted from the Red and Purple King,
just as they were practicing,
they saw a household,
and wished to go and take refuge in a vegetarian hall."*

The allegory speaks of those who seek the Dao:
they renounce wealth and nobility,
yet mistakenly believe they alone can attain it.
*"It turned out that household had no men."*
This is a place of pure *yin* and scarce *yang*—
just as the poem says,
*"the wandering bee mistook the true path."*

*"Silent and still, no roosters or dogs in sound,"*
these two creatures being *yang* are entirely absent—
the stillness of *yin* is evident.
*"They saw a woman kicking a rubber ball,"*
a symbol of *yin* and *yang* energies intertwining.
The stone cave, stone door, stone table, and stool—
all are of *yin* essence within and without.
Thus, they summed it up as:
*"A chill *yin* atmosphere."*

*"The elder’s heart was alarmed,
and in secret, he pondered many ills and few blessings,"*
his body and mind, through experience, now doubted.
Yet though alarmed,
*"there was no alternative—
he had no choice but to sit down."*
For beyond this, there was no other path to seek.

Little did he know that within this household,
the arranged provisions were merely
human oil, human flesh, and human brains—
all the *yin* essence of the human body,
utterly devoid of *yang* energy.
Thus he declared:
*"If such things were to be consumed,
this monk would never hope to behold the World-Honored One,
nor obtain the sacred scriptures!"*
This is the same meaning as:
*"If one were to use these *yin* essences as elixir materials,
how could one ascend to the Jade Capital?"*

Lost in delusion, they fail to recognize the true source,
mistake the entrance,
and are entangled endlessly,
unable to escape—
like a rope binding a high-hanging corpse.
Even if they seek to escape the outer layers,
there are still inner layers;
if they break free from the upper section,
there remains the lower.
The more they ponder,
the more the doors close—
what difference is there
between this and the silkworm spinning endless threads
at the entrance of a village?

An outside observer sees them weave through countless layers of Daoist teachings,
yet knows not that they are merely trapped in the Seven Female Demons of the Silkworm Ridge:
the silkworm, the silkworm moth, and the other six.

Alas!
A single tangled maze with no threads to follow,
seven enchanted gates forever blocking the path.»

If one seeks true liberation,
one must first bathe in the natural order of Heaven.
A spring of primordial filth—born of Heaven—must be raised,
to be found in the very center of the southern *cùn* (inch),
where the old is cast off and the new is born.

This place is where celestial immortals dwell,
yet also where demons tread.
Should one mistake demons for immortals,
and then devise new schemes,
even if the silkworm threads are all consumed,
one will only stray into false and perverse paths.

Thus, the practitioner, once transformed,
becomes a carrion fly,
nailed to the roadside—
and in an instant,
though all silkworm flies are gone,
he hears the creak of a wooden gate—
this is the man who alters his path and falls into another heresy.

To practice the art of seducing women
is to hasten one’s own death.

The practitioner says:
*"These seven beauties—
if they were to keep my master,
they would not even fill a single meal;
if they were to use him,
they would not last two days.
A single touch, and he would be dead."*

「Careful calculation reveals that the few who escape being boiled and devoured by the myriad demons are indeed rare.

Speaking of the hot springs’ origin, it traces back to Hou Yi’s shooting down the sun—nine arrows struck, one remained—symbolizing the *"yin-path’s aversion to the nine-one"* [i.e., the excess of yin]. Speaking of the women stripping and bathing, it vividly depicts the alluring beauty that melts the soul.

Those starved for lust, like hungry vultures, will spread their wings and claws, snatch away clothing, and pay no heed to modesty. Those obsessed with seduction, like loach spirits, will slither and probe, their legs and groins writhing, while abandoning their own forms.

The practitioner and Eight Rules [Eight Precepts]—both demonstrate this in person, revealing their true appearances. Snatching clothing and probing groins are all symbols of seduction and plunder.

When qi is strong, *"they are crude and heavy, unaware of cherishing jade or loving fragrance."* When disaster strikes, their entire body is injured, yet they stumble left and right like one struck by blows. *"Numb limbs, weak legs, dizzying head, blurred vision—even crawling is impossible, only groaning on the ground"*—these are real consequences. How could such things not end in death? *"The seven women laugh as they return to their old chamber, while Eight Rules keeps tumbling"*—they gain nothing from others but harm themselves.

The *Yin-Shu Jing* [Classic of the Mysterious Pivot] states: *"Fire is born from wood; when disaster arises, it will surely overcome."* This is exactly what is meant.

Moreover, yin manifestations are manifold—some cling to you like a shadow, yet are not of your true kind. Not only can they not nourish the body to form the elixir, but they will turn the entire body into poison. Their offspring—*dry children, ants, clams, spotted creatures, grasshoppers, wax moths, and dragonflies*—will swarm over the limbs, shifting and transforming endlessly, beyond all cure.

Even with medicines like *huang* [yellow], *ma* [hemp], *□* [a missing character, possibly *wu* 鸟戎, "martial bird"], *bai* [white], *diao* [falcon], *yu* [fish], and *yao* [hawk], it is already too late—this serves as a profound warning.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"I guard my form and forget my body, appearing in murky waters while lost in clear depths."* I say: *"If one forgets form while seducing women, lost in clear depths while gazing into murky waters."* Such heretical practices must be burned away with fire.

**Chapter 73: Resentment from the Past Brings Poisonous Disaster; The Heart-Master’s Misfortune Luckily Breaks the Light**

Master Wu Yi said: The earlier text spoke of solitary cultivation gone wrong, leading to schemes of seduction. Now, it shifts from seduction’s folly to the delusion of alchemical refining. All are the work of mistaken speculation by the recognizing mind.

Though they claim to see with ten thousand eyes, believing they’ve spread the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web, their vision extends no further than an inch—blindly practicing, blindly refining. How could they know the subtlety of true yin and yang? It is supremely simple, effortlessly pure, and effortlessly one—boundless in its greatness, yet without internal limits. It is found in daily life, naturally at ease, effortlessly grasped, and unfathomably subtle.

To refine cinnabar, mercury, and black lead—substances of foreign essence—is to brew poison and invite death. There is no possibility of longevity or transcendence.

Pure Yang Master said:
*"Alas for Zhang the Prefect of Jiangzhou,
who took medicine and lost his sight—his spirit withered.
He did not know the True Elixir has no substance—
to swallow gold and stone is sheer folly!"*

Zi Yang Master said:
*"Do not refine the Three Yellows or Four Spirits,
for seeking herbs is not the True Way.
If one seeks the true lead and mercury,
they are not common sand or quicksilver."*

Bai Juyi said:
*"Before Dongyue’s tomb, new graves rise,
At Beimang’s mound, the dead lie.
I’ve heard of those who erred in their elixirs,
obsessed with the art of eternal life."*

The *Biography of Wei Fu* states:
*"Once, one who twice drank the elixir of immortality was found dead in his coffin.
Another, after taking a single dose of the knife-elixir, rotted in his grave.
Lu Pi Gong swallowed the Jade Flower, yet worms crawled from his mouth.
Jia Ji swallowed the Golden Elixir, and the stench reached a hundred li.
Huangdi melted nine tripods on Jing Mountain, yet his tomb remains on Qiao Ridge.
Li Yu took Cloud-Dispersing Pills to ascend in secret, yet his head and feet were found apart.
Mo Di drank the Rainbow Elixir and drowned himself in water.
Ning Sheng swallowed the Stone Marrow and threw himself into fire.
Wu Guang chopped chives to enter a cold spring;
Xiang Cheng inhaled qi, yet his stomach and intestines rotted away."*

All these prove that alchemical refining and ingestion are not noble pursuits—they are not the Great Dao of natural transformation. These are the golden needles of this very text.

The *Daozang Song* [Song of the Daoist Canon] says:
*"Seeing those who learn Daoism along the streams,
their paths billow with fiery smoke.
They no longer await the sun’s light,
nor do they preserve the essence of yin."*

It laments the deceptive paths of alchemy,
blocking the natural source of life.
It is like seeking to form a fetus from external substances,
or hoping to bear fruit by gathering flowers—
such attempts are doomed to fail.

The Daoist master of Huanghua Guan refined mercury and lead.
On the gate of his observatory hung a plaque proclaiming *"Yellow Sprouts"* and *"Qixia Flowers"*—
sitting and concocting pills, these are the very marks of a practitioner,
yet they hide their malevolent intentions.

The Daoist said: *"This medicine must not be given to yin-people."*
They know that humans belong to yin,
yet they fail to see that they themselves are the poison within yin.

These charlatans, under the guise of secret arts,
deaf, blind, and ignorant, covet wealth and seduce the greedy.
They will not rest until flesh and marrow are exhausted—
only then will their insatiable hunger be sated.

The seven demons’ complaints—first stealing clothes, then committing deceit—
are the everyday grievances of their sect.
Those who harm others now turn to accuse them,
still clinging to the flesh of others while claiming others harm themselves.

*"Fetching the ladder to climb the rafters,
bringing down the medicine."*
The medicine has been stored for a long time,
intended solely to poison others.
They scrape the light and pure substance from the cauldron—
this is what alchemists call *"plucking feathers to ascend as a treasure."*

The Daoist said: *"My treasure, if given to a commoner,
would kill them with just a grain—
once swallowed, death is certain."*

「If given to immortals, it would kill them with just three *lī*—
*"Once swallowed, all will perish."*»
He bitterly pointed out that elixirs of gold and stone are poison beyond compare—
those who aspire to them will surely die; one must be cautious indeed.

Yet the Great Sage alone knew tea held poison—
why did he not stop it immediately?
Only after they had eaten did he intervene to settle the matter.

The Daoist said: *"You’ve brought this calamity upon yourself—
don’t you realize?"*
For in the Spider Silk Cave, he had taken his alms,
and disaster struck from deep contemplation without enlightenment;
in the Filth-Washing Spring, he had bathed,
and disaster arose from licentiousness beyond restraint.

He willingly invited the plagues of *xiaoke* (consumption), *laozhui* (wasting sickness), and *taizhe* (emaciation),
willing to squander his fortune and sacrifice his life for the death-drug—
his resolve was beyond mortal obstruction.
Thus, the evil master could poison him with impunity;
he trusted blindly, and though he died, he bore no grudge—
*"Self-made misfortune cannot be undone."*

At this end, the seven demonesses’ true nature—
their clinging, pus-and-blood essence—was revealed.
How could they ascend?

The Daoist’s ruthless desire for flesh
merely exposed his shortsightedness—
how could he transcend?

Though the silk cords gleamed with intricate weavings,
at the limits of thought, the *"spider"* still knew its doom;
though the golden flanks blazed with a thousand flames,
ten *li* away, the *"centipede"* could never match *"Wukong’s"* enlightenment.

The Old Mother of Li Mountain mastered the *Yinfu* (Obscure Symbols),
speaking of the Hundred-Eyed Demon King’s monstrous sight—
the pure *yin* recognition, harboring poisoned flames.
The *Pilao* (Pilao) nun governed *yang* energy,
resembling the purple clouds of Thousand-Flower Cave atop *Ziyun Mountain*,
manifesting supreme *yang* brilliance, piercing luminous clarity.

The embroidered needle—
neither steel, nor iron, nor gold—
forged in the eye of *Mao* (the star).
Illuminating natural wisdom,
abandoning the muddled crossroads of perception.
*"A sound breaks the golden light,"*
countless cleverness is but illusion;
*"Closing the eyes, feigning blindness,"*
when the sun rises, fire loses its glow.

The centipede’s *yang* poison revealed its true form—
where then is the Daoist’s *"yellow sprout"* and *"qi flower"*?

Wisdom shatters illusion;
*yang* subdues *yin*;
subtlety conceals profundity;
virtue eradicates evil;
one principle encompasses myriad truths;
the elixir dissolves poison—
this passage encompasses its essence.

A cultivator who, at the *Mother Hen’s* abode,
removes the *wuqi* (centipede) from the robe,
deeply grasps true and false,
and subdues the roots—
then all peripheral obstacles will be reduced to ashes,
and one may attain life while perfecting nature.

**The Seventy-Fourth Episode**
*Longcheng Reports the Demon’s Ruthlessness*
*The Disciple Demonstrates Transformative Power*

Treasure One said: *"Austerities and refining bring no benefit to longevity—
they only hasten death; this is demonic, not Dao!"*
Beyond this, where else might one seek truth?
One must empty oneself to serve others,
seeking a true master’s guidance.

If one boasts arrogantly or hesitates with doubt,
a monstrous obstacle will surely arise,
blocking the path to the West.

The opening states: *"Practicing merit, advancing in error,"*
warning disciples to proceed with caution in seeking instruction,
finding a genuine place to go.

*"The Three Saints broke free from desire’s net,
leaping from emotional bonds—
as they walked forward, they saw a towering mountain,
its peaks piercing the blue sky, truly obstructing heaven and sun.
An old man shouted: ‘Master of the West, halt for now!
On this mountain lurks a band of demons,
who have devoured countless mortals—
do not proceed!’"*

This arose from his own arrogance,
blindly rushing forward without seeking guidance,
raising a treacherous peak to block the path—
a demon born of his own hubris.

It foreshadows the later revelations of *yin-yang* mysteries,
for without humility and self-abnegation,
one cannot penetrate deeply and instead becomes a demon.

The *Laozi* says:
*"Not asserting oneself, one becomes eminent;
not praising oneself, one achieves merit;
not boasting, one endures."*
The *Zuozhuan* says:
*"When seeking something, one must first humble oneself."*
Confucius says:
*"Consider others below you."*
The *Dao Decalogue Stele* says:
*"Gentleness and weakness are the path’s crossing."*
All urge the practitioner to cultivate a yielding nature,
a humble heart seeking benefit to enter the Dao.

*"The Master said: ‘Your appearance is grotesque,
your speech vulgar—
I fear you’ll offend him,
and we’ll gain no truth.’"*
This is the passage’s core lesson.

The Disciple laughed: *"Let me change into a more refined form to ask."*
He transformed into a young novice—
truly able to alter his demeanor.

Yet phrases like *"degrading oneself to rise"* were still excessive.

The old man said: *"This novice spoke too boldly—
he’ll never grow again."*
Seeing his reckless words, he gave no reply—
arrogant speech earns no trust.

Eight Rules then bowed to ask,
begging for guidance once more.
Only with humility could true trust be earned.

Pointing to *"Lion-Tiger Ridge, Lion-Tiger Cave,"*
it symbolizes obstinate, unruly *qi*—
if the heart lacks mastery and restraint spreads unchecked,
south, north, east, and west—
all directions become demonic mouths,
and the body becomes mere meat.

Thus the Disciple said: *"I have my own plan."*
The Golden Star said: *"Only your transformative schemes
will allow passage.
If you delay even slightly,
the path will prove difficult."*

Three Sage heard these words and wished to inquire about taking another path to circumvent the obstacle—another transformative scheme—but the Disciple said, *"You cannot turn aside."*

As the *Li Sao* states:
*"The path is long and fraught with hardships,
dispatching many chariots to await the way.
The road does not bend left to turn,
but points toward the Western Sea as its goal."*

It laments the world’s tangled paths, where the straight way is unpassable.
To turn aside seems like a stratagem, yet abandoning the true path to speak of turning
is like abandoning the scripture to speak of expedients,
or abandoning the balance to speak of the hammer.
To reverse the scripture and distort the measure
is not the subtle art of weighing and balancing to judge lightness and heaviness—
thus it cannot be called an expedient.
Hence, *"You cannot turn aside."*

Since the Han dynasty, none have deeply understood this meaning.
The Immortal Master, along the journey to obtain the scriptures,
always pointed out the phrase *"You cannot turn aside,"*
profoundly illustrating that the true path—abandoning the yin-yang mysteries—
does not allow westward passage.
This can be said to be one who deeply grasps both scripture and expedient.

This is the power of transformative action,
and thus it is uniquely attributed to the Disciple.

For turning means:
the demon lords over me, and I flee the demon—
yet the demon remains, and the demons in the path of turning are even more numerous.
If the demon remains, how can I rely on turning?

The turning that does not turn:
I lord over the demon, and the demon submits to me—
the demon is already subdued, and the demons in the path of turning are already vanquished.
When the demon is subdued, that is the use of turning,
yet I do not lose the true path.

Thus, the great practitioner knows
that all external demons arise from internal demons—
not questioning the external, only the internal;
not fearing demons, only fearing myself.

The Disciple said: *"As long as we remain mindful."*

「“Transforming into a gnat” means:
to reduce the great to the small,
to refine the coarse into the subtle,
to embody the gentle and tender state of an infant—
yet never losing the pure, innocent heart.

The infant’s heart,
by nature, is true knowing (*liángzhī*),
free from all private intent—
demons cannot penetrate it.

Entering through the demon’s ear,
exiting from the demon’s mouth—
this very act of transforming into a gnat in a single thought
is already enough to pierce through the demon’s belly.

The heart commands fire (*xīnhuǒ*),
yet its emptiness and luminosity remain unobscured—
thus it is called *“the one who stokes the fire”* (*shāohuǒ de*).
Fire needs wind to spread,
and when it rides the wind, it burns even more fiercely—
thus it is called *“the master of the wind”* (*zǒngzhàn fēng*).

The most wondrous part lies in the *“Investigating the true and false”* section:
unifying great and small into one,
blending true and false into a single household—
this is the stroke of the divine creating ghostly illusions,
painting words of the heart’s inner deliberation,
not to be taken as literal reality (*shíxiàng*).

The true heart is originally the true master of the wind (*zhēnzhuānfēng*),
yet in the demon’s realm, it becomes false;
The true master of the wind is originally false heart (*jiǎxīn*),
yet in the demon’s realm, it becomes true.

Using false to investigate the true,
the false can become true;
Using true to follow the false,
the true also becomes false.

Thus it is said:
“When it aligns with me, it is true;
When it strays even slightly, it is false.”

This is the genuine speech of the small master of the wind (*xiǎo zhuānfēng*),
which is also the profound discourse of the great master of the wind (*dà zhuānfēng*).」

The demon of reckless speech stirs up martial ambition—
its origins lie in self-forged delusion.
The minor demon’s warnings—
*"swallowing the Heavenly Host,"*
*"contending with Heaven,"*
*"the Peach Blossom Feast"*—
mirror the Journeyer’s deeds from five hundred years past.

What the demon does, the Journeyer has done;
thus the Journeyer says:
*"If it’s mere boastful talk, I’ve done worse myself."*

Yet the claim—
*"once swallowed ten million Heavenly Soldiers"*—
though seemingly absurd,
merely captures the bold, exaggerated spirit.

As in Song Yu’s words:
*"Bent bow hung on the Fu Sang,*
*long sword leaned against Heaven’s pillar";*
or *"drinking like a great whale absorbing the hundred rivers";*
or Yang Da’s *"hand plucking stars from the sky";*
or Wang Xizhi’s *"brush strokes sweeping a thousand-man army";*
or Wen Tianxiang’s *"southern will to prop up Kunlun,*
*northern will to swallow the Yellow River whole"*—
all such speech is grand yet empty,
wild yet ungrounded—
the very demon of the Dao.

The Journeyer first *"darkly laughs,"*
then *"darkly ponders,"*
finally *"darkly startles,"*
threefold reflection to curb himself.

The *"Yin-Yang Qi Bottle"*—
its transformations boundless,
its subtleties fused in profound unity.
Encountered with crude boldness, few escape its grasp;
met with empty boasting, none avoid its depths.
Its aperture is both utterly void and utterly firm—
unless one studies it with meticulous care,
penetrating to its core,
one will never pass through.

The Journeyer says:
*"Only beware the bottle itself."*
To guard against it,
one must first cultivate evenness of breath and caution in speech.

The many-mouthed are the greatest harm to the heart—
thus to seize the cave’s demon,
one must first dispel the gate’s specter,
scattering minor demons,
removing the many-mouthed.

The marvel lies in the phrase *"Tang Seng’s flesh—no more than a few scraps"*—
speaking of flavor so sparse and simple,
so few and far between,
that all their clamoring is but wasted drooling.
What use are the many-mouthed then?

Yet if one speaks grand lies to deceive,
scattering minor demons may work—
how can it escape the Great Demon’s devouring?

In the seventy-fifth installment—
*"The Monkey’s Spirit Pierces Yin-Yang’s Aperture,"*
*"The Demon Lord Returns to the True Dao"*—
Master Wu Yi says:
This is the wondrous application of refining essence into qi,
the initial stage of transformation and change.

Of old, Lao Dan spoke to Confucius:
*"Banish your arrogant qi."*
For *"arrogant"* is the Dao’s demon.

If one uses softness and advances with weakness,
then nothing rigid remains unyielding,
nothing strong remains unweakened.

I cultivate my sharp edge well—
the demon loses its perfect defenses,
and the demon returns to my true self.

Unless one humbles the will,
penetrates Yin-Yang’s secrets,
and deeply grasps the workings of creation,
one will never fathom its depths.

Laozi said:
*"Without desire, I observe its marvel;
with desire, I observe its subtleties."*
Zhu Xi said:
*"Without study, do not force attack."*
Both point to the subtleties and marvels of Yin-Yang qi—
difficult to penetrate.

Later scholars, unaware of the Dao’s essence,
claim *"the heart is the Dao,"*
and by probing the heart with the heart,
lose all trace of subtlety and marvel.

Zhang Zai said:
*"From qi’s transformation comes the name Dao."*
Thus, it is already clear that the Dao belongs to Yin-Yang,
not to the heart—
though the heart is the master of piercing its subtleties and marvels.

*"The Great Sage transforms into a tiny wind-drilling insect,
entering the Lion’s Mane Cave"*—
this is the transformation of softness and weakness,
seeking with an empty heart.

*"Transforming into a fly"*—
the ultimate of softness and weakness.

Startling the old demon,
unaware it laughs,
its careless jest reveals its flaw—
how else could it be bound by the treasure bottle?

The treasure bottle unites Yin-Yang qi,
water and fire in primal chaos,
encompassing spirit and vitality—
nothing escapes its transformation.

In the human body, it is the root of the navel’s central yellow breath,
the alchemical *"play of the mysterious female,"*
where spirit is condensed and the path is sealed—
the so-called *"white jade linked rings."*

Central in position,
it contains the seven treasures, eight trigrams, and twenty-four qi—
nothing is excluded.

The body mirrors heaven and earth,
and this orifice symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate—
no duality exists.

Yet this, when followed correctly, becomes the marvel of human perfection;
when reversed, it becomes the marvel of elixir cultivation.

Students of the Dao reach this point,
bewildered and unable to probe—
only to retreat in despair.

Only by penetrating its inner workings
does one realize that the alchemical method is but this—
with only internal and external, correct and inverted, distinctions.

Yet how foolish to cling to this treasure bottle,
claiming *"essence begets qi, qi begets spirit,"*
condensing spirit here, fixing intent to seal it—
only to hasten one’s own transformation!

The old demon says:
*"Monkey, this time you enter my treasure bottle—
no more thoughts of the Western Path."*

The immortal sage’s words here awaken many spring dreams.
*"Sealed within the bottle"*—
condensing spirit at the qi-orifice,
the symbol of refining essence into qi.
*"Closing breath, forgetting speech"*—
silent and unmoving—
stillness belongs to water;
*"losing voice, breaking into laughter"*—
stirred and responsive—
responsiveness belongs to fire.

Thus, hearing words ignites fire—
the principle of dynamic response in stillness.

*"Forty snakes twisted into eighty"*—
the four symbols divided into eight trigrams;
*"three fire dragons spiraling above and below"*—
the interplay of sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire.

Again, three and four make seven,
two and four make eight,
three and eight make twenty-four,
four and eight make thirty-two—
counting in cycles,
they still align with the bottle’s *"seven treasures, eight trigrams, twenty-four qi,"*
and *"thirty-six persons."*

*"Long body, short body"*—
all reveal that movement and stillness adapt to the body,
yet one cannot perceive its subtleties to escape.

To cling here and seek transcendence—
this is to grasp a named form
while hoping for the origin of the nameless—
is it not self-deception?

The Journeyer says:
*"Who would have thought today I’d fall into this,
losing my very life?
It must be my past name
that brings this present calamity."*

Recalling the Bodhisattva’s transmission of the three-hair saving thread,
he returns to true truth.

Through transformation and study,
he pierces the heavens’ secrets,
opens the Bodhisattva’s law-eye,
reveals Yin-Yang’s hidden marvels,
shatters doubt,
escapes the fire-pit—
the true Dao of transcending birth and death!

*"Transforming into a cicada,
temporarily perching on a branch,
wandering atop the demon’s head;
setting down the cup,*
suddenly astonished to find the bottle empty—
how could one not cry out in shattering the pot!"

*"Empty"*—also *"control"*—
laboring in vain, boiling an empty pot with water and fire;
*"searching"*—also *"fleeing"*—
seeking a hollow cave in vain.

Alas!
*"The bottle is pierced—
no one can be sealed within."*
Like the body’s true yang already dissipated,
no elixir remains—
ancients likened it to *"breaking the forked sack."*
This is the meaning.

Studying to this point,
the Dao-heart manifests itself,
the demon’s audacity falters.

True essence refines into true qi,
true qi transforms into the body—
enlightenment dawns on true emptiness,
everywhere is the Dao.

Where the demon’s blade falls,
I become—
I, the demon’s manifestation,
split into two, yet still two selves—
though countless billions of bodies,
they are all still me;

I head meets—it becomes true,
True—*the original body of the demon*,
clasped to my form—
still, one and the same.
Though countless billions of demons,
they are all still true.

One becomes two, two becomes one—
thus the demon reveals its original form to devour the true self,
I am the true demon;
I enter the demon’s belly, subduing its head,
I am demon of the demon.

*"Stay through winter, reach Qingming"*—
symbolizing the ebb and flow of yin-yang *qi*;
*"Practice inhalation-exhalation, sneeze"*—
illustrating the false actions of mouth and nose.
*"Take the medicine elixir, trumpet-mouth"*—
soon the peach-blossom face glows red;
*"Scatter the wine-qi, somersault"*—
only then is the treasure hidden in the *utpala* belly revealed.

Ah!
*Transform qi!* *Transform qi!*
How shall it emerge?
This must have a method.

*"When Old Monkey thrusts his *jin-gu* staff into his crown—
a hole is pierced:
first as a sky-light,
second as a smoke-chute."*
Is this not the supreme method for *qi* to exit?

Those who expound the Dao reveal the heavens’ secrets to this point—
truly, they know deeply and speak exhaustively.

Divine!
Wondrous!

「Yet this is but the *true* understanding of the *Way*’s core, but the practitioner has not yet attained its *true* subtlety—thus it is the *"initial vehicle"* (初乘).

**Chapter 76: *Heart-Mind Dwells, Demon Returns to Its True Nature* (心神居舍魔归性)**
*Wood-Mother’s* descent betrays the demon’s true form (木母同降怪体真).
*The Awakened One* said: This reveals the profound art of refining *qi* and transforming *spirit*—the *"middle vehicle"* (中乘) of Daoist practice and change.

*The Zhuangzi* teaches: *"When the mind’s intent is undivided, it coalesces into *spirit*."* (用志不分，乃凝于神。)
*The Master* said: *"The heart is the sovereign of *qi*; *qi* is the root of *spirit*; *spirit* is the very *nature* itself. The form is the dwelling of *qi*; *spirit* is the essence of the form; *qi* is the vital *command*."* (心者气之主，气者神之根，神即性也；形者气之舍，神者形之精，气即命也。)
Indeed, refining the *form* (形) allows the *essence* (精) to transform *qi*; when *qi* gathers, it transmutes into *spirit*; when *spirit* is concentrated at the *qi*’s aperture (气穴), *qi* grows ever more potent, and *spirit* becomes ever more luminous (灵).
Yet this *essence* is not the *yin* essence of copulation (交感精), this *qi* is not the breath of respiration (呼吸气), this *spirit* is not the restless mind of deliberation (思虑神).
As *Duzijian* (督子) says: *"From the void it arises, not in heart or kidney, but in the *Xuanmen* aperture alone."* (从虚无中来，不在心肾，而在于玄关一窍。)
Scholars who fail to grasp *yin-yang* merely grope at their own bodies, mistaking the *manifest* and *luminous* cognition (昭昭灵灵之识神) for true attainment—thus they wander far astray.

In the text: *"The Old Demon roars, ‘Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Sage of Equal Heavenly Rank!’"* (老魔叫一声：‘大慈大悲齐天大圣菩萨！ ’)
Calling *"Great"* (大) repeatedly, he seeks *command* (命) through the *one* (人) within.
*The Pilgrim* replies: *"Shorten it by a few characters—just call ‘Old Monkey’s grandfather, Sun Wukong.’"* (行者道：‘省几个字儿，只叫孙外公果。 ’)
The Old Demon, thus addressed, truly calls out: *"Grandfather! Grandfather!"*
This shows that recognizing the *external* and *internal* dualities (外来二八厶厶) is the true way to borrow *command*.

Why send him out with a *single-vehicle* bamboo litter (一乘香藤轿)?
It signifies that only this *single-vehicle* method is genuine—all others are false.

*"The Pilgrim acts within the Demon’s belly"*—
his *heart-mind* (心神) dwells and refines, calming the *internal* to secure the *external*.
*"He binds his heart-liver with a single thread"*—
placing it in one fixed point, holding the *commercial* (商) to govern the *excessive* (多).
*"Then he shrinks his body, facing the Demon’s steel fangs and sharp blades"*—
controlling his *form* (形) and *spirit* (魄), using the *small* to subdue the *great*, the *yielding* to overcome the *unyielding*.
*"With a sneeze, the Pilgrim bursts forth—seeing the wind, he grows three zhang tall"*—
refining *qi* (气) reveals the *original spirit* (元神).
*"Severing the outer, the inner feels distress"*—
*internal* and *external* are one; *emotion* (情) does not part from *nature* (性)—this is not a clear-cut severance.

*"The Three Demons fall together, bowing their heads; the host of demons retreat, all returning to their caves"*—
this is the refining of *qi* and transforming of *spirit*, where the demon submits to its true *nature*.

Yet even at this stage, though the *yang spirit* (阳神) appears, the *yin qi* (阴气) has not yet integrated with *my* (我) *qi* as one—so the demon remains, like a traveler still midway.

In the text: *"The Master and Disciple pack their belongings and horses, waiting along the road"*—
and at its end: *"The Demon and monsters, united in heart and intent, march west for another four hundred li"*—
merely illustrating the midpoint of their journey.

The practitioner must now diligently apply *fire cultivation* (火功), proceed with utmost caution, lest he falter—
for if *yin qi* is not subdued, it will encroach upon the *original spirit*, when will he transcend?

*"The False Descents of the Two Demons"*—
*yin qi* not yet mastered.
*"The Three Demons’ ‘Separate the Tiger from the Mountain’"*—
*yin qi* not yet mastered.
*"The Thirty Monsters, arranging tea and meals, hosting the Tang Monk"*—
the lingering of *yin qi*.
*"The Sixteen Ghosts, in turn shouting orders, replacing the litter-bearers"*—
the harassment of *yin qi*.

*"Beholding the city’s malevolent *qi*"*—
the obstruction of *yin qi*.
*"Each harbors wrathful *qi*—thunderous clashes erupt; the Three Monks and Three Demons battle to the death"*—
*yin qi* and *yang spirit* intermingle, locked in struggle.
*"They bear the Tang Monk aloft, silence their banners and drums; the monsters swirl around him, the Elder sinks into a stupor"*—
*yin qi* overwhelms in its vast, desolate power, and the true *yang* is once more submerged.

Tracing the root of this failure:
*Wood-Mother* indulged in private schemes, while *fire cultivation* was weak.
*"At the slightest provocation, he scatters *fire*"*—
*fire cultivation* is weak.
*"He hoards his private stores"*—
*Wood-Mother* indulges in private schemes.
Only because of this weakness, he suffered defeat in battle—*fire* was exhausted by *earth*.
Only because of this indulgence, he was terrified into feigning submission—*wood* was overwhelmed by *water*.

Thus, the translation concludes.

The Dao of seeking the scriptures forbids complacency and sloth, demanding instead steadfast and arduous effort. The Pilgrim says: *"Let him endure some hardship, that he may know the difficulty of seeking the scriptures."*

Knowing that the quest cannot do without the *Wood-Mother*, yet that the monstrous forms must be subdued through mutual descent—when *metal* and *wood* harmonize, the male leads while the female follows, as brothers in affection, the elder and younger in accord. *"The Pilgrim obeys Eight Rules and strikes through the elephant’s trunk, while Eight Rules obeys the Pilgrim and beats the elephant’s hide. Two elephant powers, together subduing the monsters."* Is this not the true spirits uniting their strength, the true monsters manifesting their forms?

Thus, the guiding principle states:
*"The mind-spirit dwells in the demon’s nature, the Wood-Mother descends with the monster’s true form."*

In the seventy-seventh chapter—*Group Demons Mock True Nature, One Body Pays Homage to True Suchness*—Master Yu says: This is the wondrous application of refining the spirit back to emptiness, the supreme technique of transformation and action. Subduing the Lion’s heart earned the first stage; subduing the Elephant’s nature earned the middle stage; subduing the Peng’s *qi* earned the highest stage. When the Great Suchness Dao arrives, though it is said the mind-spirit dwells in the demon’s nature, the spirit and *qi* have not yet merged into undivided oneness, returning to the Great Void—then this mind-nature remains entangled in existence and cannot transcend the mundane. Thus, the Great Peng was not subdued in *qi*, and the Lion and Elephant followed suit—*"the group demons mock the true nature."*

The Master said: *"Subduing qi does not serve qi; serving qi requires subduing qi. Serving qi does not bring longevity; longevity requires subduing qi."* The Peng does not yield to *qi*, for it follows the true *yin* *qi*, roaming freely through heaven and earth without submission, making the demon’s influence vast. *"Lion"* symbolizes the mind, belonging to *fire*, prone to suspicion, hence its green hue. Fire not yet ignited but smoke arising—*fire* combined with *wood*—it is the leader of cultivation, the foundation of the Dao’s practice, hence called the Old Demon. Its domain is named *"Lion’s Ridge, Lion’s Cave."*

*"Elephant"* symbolizes nature, belonging to *earth*, generating *metal*, hence its white hue. It rests upon the body and resides in the west, *earth* combined with *metal*—it is the mighty strength bearing the Dao, the luminous essence embodying the Dao, hence called the Second Demon. To subdue these two demons is to attain the Two Vehicles, the wondrous application of cultivating nature.

The Great Peng is the *kun* of the Northern Sea in *Zhuangzi*, transforming into the Peng, soaring ninety thousand *li* southward. The Northern Sea is water—*"uttermost yin, solemn and austere, yet within it lies yang."* The *kun* in water is *yang*; transforming into the Peng, soaring ninety thousand *li* southward, it reaches the extreme of *yang* in its ninefold power. Thus, *"uttermost yang, blazing beneath the Great Brightness above."* The Peng belongs to the Phoenix, the Vermilion Bird of the South. The *Shi Han Ji* says: *"The Vermilion Bird blazes through the void descending,"* akin to the *Dan Jing*’s *"Crimson Phoenix,"* both referring to true *yang qi* and the wondrous application of nurturing life.

Those who read *Nan Hua* know it as self-expression but fail to grasp that it expounds the essential mysteries of the Great Dao thus. At the end, the Buddha speaks of *"Chaos first dividing, heaven opening, earth forming, all things born. The Phoenix obtains the harmonizing qi, nurturing the孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀

The opening lines—*"The Old Demon devours the Eight Precepts,"* where Wood and Fire are ensnared by Wood and Fire demons; *"The Two Demons drag away Sha Zeng,"* where Earth and Metal are ensnared by Earth and Metal demons; *"The Three Demons strike down the Pilgrim,"* where Water and Metal are ensnared by Water and Metal demons—

When bound together, their failure to subdue and unify into oneness reveals that their very nature is demonic, deceiving their own true nature.

*"One wing spanning nine ten-thousands"*—this is the meaning of *"Peng lofts nine ten-thousands,"* as previously explained.

Yet in the ninety-ninth chapter, when detailing the inner trials, the *"Monster’s threefold hue"* is revealed as the *"Sixty-Two Trials,"* where the Peng-Monster is crimson and gold-winged, stirring the Northern and Southern Seas, blending the hues of Lion and Elephant into the primordial *Wu Xing* true *Yi* qi—neither manifesting its color nor confining itself to a single name, thus its grandeur.

The Dao of transcendence demands mastery over this qi. If one fixates solely on the mind-nature as ultimate truth, then the very *hou tian* qi of our body falls under its devouring, cyclical, and ceaselessly digesting grasp—never able to uproot itself from its cage.

The Sun-Wukong of old, in his boastful defiance, declares:
*"My mighty lord can swallow ten ten-thousands of celestial soldiers in one gulp."*
*"My lord desires to challenge Heaven."*
*"Five hundred years ago, he devoured the Lion-Elephant Kingdom and seized its realm."*
This already foreshadows the meaning above.

*"The Old Fiend praised his strength and cunning, ordering the minor demons to fetch water, stir the pot, and haul out the iron cage to steam the monk and scatter them each to their own fate."*
*"Bound within the cage, he shall surely not escape."*
The lesser demons took turns stoking the fire, awaiting the moment when the monk’s vital essence would be consumed.

This speaks of how one cannot break free from the ceaselessly rotating *Wu Xing* steaming-qi, and how his bones and flesh must inevitably dissolve.

*"The Elder cried to the Pilgrim, ‘How shall we save our lives?’ The two monks wept in unison."*
This laments that all are unaware of the *Dao* of escape.

*"The Pilgrim laughed, ‘Master, fear not. Brothers, cease your tears. Whatever he may do, I shall suffer no harm.’ He then gathered his spirit, leapt into the air, and vanished from sight."*

The words speak of spirit and enlightenment, for it lies within the person. If one seeks to escape the cycle of life and death, there exists a method of leaping beyond the body.

Human existence within the *Wu Xing* is like being trapped in an iron cage, subjected to steaming—when the fire reaches its peak, none escape unscathed, their flesh rotting and bones dissolving. Thus, death is as inevitable as night follows day, with none spared.

The *Dao* of escape begins with subduing desires through *fùlóng* (伏龙, "Suppressed Dragon")—quelling passions as one draws fuel from beneath the cauldron, preventing the flames from surging. The Great Sage dispatched the Northern Sea Dragon to guard beneath the pot, drawing fuel as *fùlóng* does.

Next, it lies in cultivating virtue through precepts to soothe the mind, opening a boundless and uninhibited spirit, so that *qi* does not stagnate. The Eight Rules [Precepts] spoke of "stifled *qi*" and "releasing *qi*," for when the Pilgrim sealed the pot, the Eight Rules declared, *"Tonight, death is certain."*

The Elder wept bitterly, revealing how stifled *qi* becomes a demon—most pitiable of afflictions. The Eight Rules exclaimed:
*"Hark! O fire-tender, why add more fuel? You’ve sealed your own fate!"*
Truly wondrous!

The **Tianpeng** found himself trapped in the iron cage’s cruel fate, yet at the moment of dire peril, he lounged about with carefree ease, as though playing at leisure. Knowing he looked down upon all things, insufficient to be a demon, what was the breadth of his heart?

Thus, the fire-tending minor demon dozed and slept soundly.

When the Pilgrim revealed himself to save, the Eight Rules said:
*"Escape must mean breaking free from the cage’s roots—
do not again let it steam you!"*

He meant that to evade the Five Elements’ [五行] suffocating *qi* was to break free from the cage’s roots,
while to be unable to evade the Five Elements’ suffocating *qi* was to be trapped again within its steam.

If a cultivator cannot transcend the mundane and escape the cycle of existence,
though his virtue and conduct may be flawless,
he remains bound within rebirth,
his ordinary essence still rooted—
how could he avoid the fate of being recaptured and steamed once more?

Therefore, the Pilgrim declared:
*"If my master is no more than an ordinary being,
we three will leave anyway, no matter what."*

Yet this path of breaking free from the cage’s roots and escaping the world
is the grand liberation—
splitting apart the primordial chaos and piercing through the formless void,
not the petty tricks of ignoring discipline,
or scheming to climb walls.

When master and disciple climbed the wall,
the demon suddenly awoke,
seizing them all—
they were bound to be recaptured and steamed again.
Even if they did not wrong others,
how could they benefit themselves?

But how did they not face recapture and steaming?
How did the demon cling to the Tang Monk, refusing to let him go,
and thrust him into the **Jinxin Iron Chest** [锦香铁柜],
planning to devour him alive?

It was because he knew that all worldly shortcuts and minor arts
are but schemes to climb walls—
they inevitably lead to being locked in the chest.

Alas! Most mortals fall prey to the demon’s cruel jaws of life’s torment,
yet even the Tang Monk is no exception.
When the Great Sage hears this, how could his heart not be torn like a knife,
his tears not surge like a spring, and his voice not burst in great lamentation?
He says:
*"Strive to practice and refine the demon together,"*
*"Yet when the qi scatters and the heart is wounded, what can be done?"*
This is the great weeping!

Thus, he weeps for all beings now in this moment of distressed reflection,
of diligent cultivation and growth.
He manifests his form and devises a method,
urgently turning back to sweep away the Lion-Demons’ Den
and awaken with fierce resolve,
seeing the Tathāgata recite the *Songgu Caṣṭra*,
to achieve transcendence.

Look—
*"Directly ascending the Spirit Mountain,"*
*"Roaring like thunder!"*
How bold and diligent is his progress!

The Tathāgata points to the old demon’s two monstrous disciples,
declaring that the Great Phoenix is born from the Azure Dapeng,
and shares the same mother—孔雀—as the Peacock,
both being the very *Dharma-mothers* of compassion and mercy.
When the Peacock first emerged,
it swallowed a man in a single breath—
even the Tathāgata was swallowed whole,
meaning *"one mouth can devour ten million heavenly warriors."*
Yet the Tathāgata had already cultivated his *Jianliu Jīnshēn*—*
a golden body of six feet.
Thus, he could enter the demon’s mouth and split its back.

The Tang Monk had not yet attained the golden body,
and risked being swallowed by the demon’s jaws,
unable to transcend.
Therefore, he must subdue this demon
before he can achieve the *Jianliu Jīnshēn*—
a golden body of six feet.

So, all demons that bind me, steam me, swallow me, or lock me in their chests,
do so out of their love, their nurturing, their molding, and their creation—
not only do they harbor great grudges,
but they also bestow great kindness.

孔雀 and 大鹏,
both embodying boundless compassion and mercy,
are truly *Dharma-mothers*—
what more could one doubt?

Later generations, seeing the Peacock enshrined as a *Dharma-mother*,
take offense at the Buddha’s teachings on impartiality toward kin,
yet they fail to grasp Mencius’ words:
*"To cultivate one’s heart and endure with steadfastness,
one must first experience hardship and suffering."*

Nor do they recognize that the Great Phoenix symbolizes the *Zhenyi*—
the primordial *qi* of true essence,
which is indeed the mother of all who become immortals, Buddhas, or sages.

*"Fine pearls sink to the ocean’s depths,
hard gold is refined in raging flames—*
the most genuine truths emerge from great demons,
and those who penetrate to their core
are never won without peril and risk.*

If one seeks the Dao without first facing the Great Phoenix
and subduing it with bold resolve,
they will never become an immortal or a Buddha—
an unalterable truth.

*"The Tathāgata summoned Manjushri and Samantabhadra to the Lion-Demons’ country,
commanding the Pilgrim to battle the monsters,
luring them before the Buddha’s presence.
The monsters, seeing the past, future, and present Triple World-honored images,
as well as the Arhat and *Keshin*,
recognized the protagonist."*

Not recognizing the protagonist as the heart—
why so?
*"The past heart cannot be obtained;
the future heart cannot be obtained;
the present heart cannot be obtained."*
The Lion and Elephant demons,
being demons of heart-nature,
fail to recognize the true heart-nature—
this is the victory of the true heart.

Returning to the authentic form,
the ears vanish and the reliance is extinguished—
the heart-nature merges with the primordial *qi*.

*"Only the three demons refused to submit,
rising straight into the heavens.
The Tathāgata raised his hand and pointed upward—
the monsters could not fly away,
remaining only on the Buddha’s crown,
where they revealed their true forms:
a Great Phoenix with golden wings."*

This one,
the very essence of a single grain of golden elixir—
the *Zhenyi qi*,
which the Tathāgata has plainly shown how to subdue.

*"To the Tathāgata, they cried:
‘How dare you use the Great Dao’s power to bind me!’"*
The Great Dao’s power,
the Buddha’s true and direct teaching,
cannot be openly revealed—
it is transmitted outside the scriptures.

*"To escape difficulty, one must only take refuge."*
*"The Buddha’s ancestors dare not loosen their grip,
only commanding me to serve as a guardian in the radiant flames."*
This is *"obtaining one, all things are complete."*
Refining the spirit and returning to emptiness,
the supreme path of severing roots and salvation.

Yet one must first awaken great courage and firm resolve
to subdue this demon.

The Great Phoenix declares:
*"Monkey! You’ve gone too far in tormenting me!"*
His cruelty is the very seat of compassion—
the one who can apply the true Dao.

Unable to apply the true Dao,
one becomes a demon of the Lion, Elephant, or Phoenix—
a host of demons.
Able to apply the true Dao,
one becomes the Lion’s truth, the Elephant’s truth, the Phoenix’s truth—
a unified whole.

The Pilgrim realizes the Tathāgata’s method of subduing demons,
the *Shāmen* strikes the iron chest with a single rod,
saving the monk and setting them on their way—
this is the resolve of a true practitioner,
unyielding even in a hundred setbacks.

Thus it is said:
*"The true scripture must be taken by the true person,
while demons, though myriad in form, are all but illusions."*

**Chapter 78**
The *Bīqú* [比丘] pities his son and dispatches a shadow spirit,
The *Jīndiàn* [金殿] recognizes the demon and discusses Daoist morality.

The *Wùyīzǐ* [悟一子] says:
The *Dàodé* [道德]’s Five Thousand Words
center on *"obtaining one, all things are complete."*

*"One"* refers to the primordial *Zhenyi qi*—
the essence that generates heaven, earth, and all beings.
As the primordial *qi* gives birth to the fruit of *Hòutiān*—
the post-heavenly realm,
so too does the fruit contain *rén*—
the virtue of primordial harmony.
The post-heavenly *rén*,
the very presence of the primordial *qi*,
is possessed by all—
near and intimate.

If one attains *rén*,
then the life-force remains and branches flourish naturally—
the matter of longevity is already accomplished.

*"Rén"* mirrors *"two"* and *"person"* [人],
embodying the marvel of yin and yang merging in virtue—
not something a single person can fully achieve through solitary cultivation.

The *Yì* [易] says:
*"One yin and one yang constitute the Dao."*
Mencius says:
*"Rén is the very nature of being human.
Together, they form the Dao."*

Later scholars fail to grasp the true meaning of *Dàodé*,
misunderstanding the profound uses of *Kǎn* [坎] and *Lí* [离].
They err and fabricate false theories,
even claiming that *"harnessing yin to supplement yang"* is a cure for bodily ailments,
leading the blind to guide the blind—
like feeding arsenic to the hungry,
or carrying ice to ward off the cold—
inevitably harming life and shortening years.
This is to abandon the utmost *rén* and practice the greatest *bùrén*—
unrighteousness.

Ah, the great error! The great error!
The Immortal Master, in His boundless compassion,
used the metaphor of the *"goose-cage"* for the innocent—
*"Goose"* is a mispronunciation—
to show how the ignorant are ensnared in cruel bondage,
as though one were to place a helpless infant upon the slaughter’s block.

Examine its origin:
All stems from the *heart-sovereign’s* [心君] delusion,
bewitched by false and perverse teachings.
Thus, the text repeatedly speaks of *"the dim-witted ruler"* [昏君],
to reveal its meaning.

Every person possesses the *innocent’s heart* [赤子之心],
rooted in boundless compassion and mercy—
yet now, misled and confined,
they perish in ignorance.
What was once plainly called *"Bhikṣu’s Realm"* [比丘国]
has now been twisted into *"City of the Little Ones"* [小子城].

When the disciples see the goose-cage and pause in doubt,
they inquire at the *Golden Pavilion Inn* of the *drystation officer* [驿丞],
asking why such a cage exists—
suspecting he may lack the ways of nurturing life.

The officer replies:
*"Heaven tolerates no second sun, nor does humanity two principles.
To rear a child—
nine months in the womb, then born—
three years of milk and care,
gradually forming body and form—
how could one not know this truth?"*

Yet they *know* the way of birth arises from the natural *Dao* of Heaven and humanity,
yet forcefully contrive and brutalize life to such extremes,
claiming this holds some *Dao*—
I know not what *Dao* they speak of!
Thus it is called *"the affair of no-Dao"* [无道之事].

They speak of:
*"Daoists offering maidens,
kings indulging in favored consorts,
night and day lost in lust,
until their bodies wither and their lives hang by a thread;
gathering herbs complete,
using the hearts and livers of one thousand one hundred and eleven children as medicine,
so that, upon ingestion, one gains the power of eternal youth—
a rumor called *City of the Little Ones*" [小子城].*

How erroneous! How tragic!
Worse even than the deeds of *Ma Shu* [麻叔谋] and *Zhao Si* [赵思绾]!

「Is the world truly filled with such perverse practices as taking hearts as medicine? It is merely a metaphor to warn of the wickedness of those who stray from the true *Dao* and the dire consequences they bring upon themselves through ignorance!

Yet when they speak of a thousand one hundred and ten hearts,
they mean but one heart in truth.
All human hearts are the same—
the repetition only serves to emphasize their cruelty.
See the meaning in the single word *"one"* [一].

The *Daoist* practitioner says:
*"I fear they have wandered into false paths,
unaware of the true *Dao*,
merely taking external alchemy as genuine,
until I reveal the essence of *Xiantian* [先天],
and turn them back to the right path."*

For such practices as consorting with women and gathering herbs,
which destroy the body and extinguish life,
are but post-heaven dross [后天渣滓].
How could they be true?

If the essence of *Xiantian* [先天],
it is formless and void,
arising naturally.
Only through silent illumination [神明默运],
hidden cultivation of *yin virtue* [阴德],
and escaping the snare of delusion [摄脱讹笼],
can one rescue the ensnared and transform destruction into life—
no longer taking as medicine,
this very moment is the *Saviour of Living Beings Buddha* [救生药师佛],
and one attains the *Xiantian* method of transcending the world [先天度世之要旨].

The Three Treasures [三藏] chanted the *Dharma* of the *Yushifu* [药师佛],
the Great Sage [大圣] acted and issued his decree,
each creature employed their spiritual powers [神通],
as the cold winds and mournful mists [阴风惨雾]
carried away the *Ego-Cage* [鹅笼],
and the bewildered king began to awaken.

Thus, upon seeing the Three Treasures [三藏],
the king rejoiced and said:
*"These distant monks must surely possess the *Dao* and its practice [道行]."*
This was the golden hall’s discourse on *Chan* and the *Dao*—
it could not be suppressed.

The Three Treasures spoke of *Chan*,
all emphasizing the mind’s true nature and refuting the taking of external things.
They said:
*"Firm sincerity and awareness,
must first recognize the mind.
A pure mind shines alone,
a mind with attachments sees all phenomena clearly."*

They also said:
*"If the mind remains undisturbed,
all actions will be complete.
To speak of taking *yin* to supplement *yang* [采阴补阳],
is sheer falsehood;
to claim that ingesting elixirs grants longevity [服饵长寿],
is mere empty talk."*

Since the king had already misused his mind,
and fallen into false *Dao*,
the illness was the medicine of his own making.

The king’s attendant said:
*"Within the *Jie mie* [寂灭] school of *Dao*,
one must speak of recognizing *xing* [性].
You do not know from where *xing* is extinguished—
sitting in vain and blindly practicing *Chan*,
it is all futile striving and delusion."*

He also said:
*"You plunder the *f秀气* [f秀气] of Heaven and Earth,
and gather the *hua精* [华精] of the sun and moon.
You manipulate *yin* and *yang* to form the elixir,
and press *water* and *fire* to solidify the embryo.
You follow the seasons in collecting medicines,
and nurture the nine transformations to refine the elixir into completion."*

He further said:
*"Your quiet *Chan* teachings and *Shijie* [释教] doctrines,
which extinguish the *yin spirit* [阴神],
leave behind only the foul shell of the *Nirvana* [涅盘],
and do not escape the dust of the mundane.
Each word is a true saying from the *Daode Jing* [《道德》],
yet differs not from what the *Muxian An* [木仙庵] and *Fuyun Sou* [拂云叟] spoke of.
But he spoke of it in vain,
while you act falsely—
both are perverse delusions."*

The *Daoist* practitioner saw through their hypocrisy,
knowing their words were false,
and cried out:
*"Master, this attendant is a demonic heretic!"*

The attendant said:
*"Just now, upon entering the court,
I saw a marvelous elixir—
far superior to the hearts of a thousand one hundred and eleven children!"*

He had first lost his true heart through ignorance,
then extinguished his own innate virtue [良心],
and finally, through madness,
mistook human hearts for the true heart of the *Dao*—
all perverse delusions.

The king, blind to truth,
ordered the monks to take his heart as medicine—
as if he could extract its essence like one taking a woman’s body as medicine!
Could such a thing be attained?

He did not know that the *Dao* of *Xiantian* [先天]
has the wondrous, unfathomable transformations—
great and small inversions, head and face reversals,
shifting and changing beyond measure—
which are not confined solely to the heart.

Thus the *Daoist* practitioner said:
*"If you wish to succeed,
greatly do the small."*
*"Eight Precepts urinates a puddle—
a foul clump;
The *Daoist* practitioner molds mud into a piece—
like a monkey’s face;
A breath of *Xianqi* [仙气] is blown—
the Elder changes;
Shaking his body, he transforms into a monk’s face."*

The fleeting instant—
when inner and outer mutually aid,
shifting and transforming creation—
the wondrous Dao of Heaven’s mechanism,
silent yet cannot be concealed,
spoken yet cannot be revealed—
merely prattling of the *Dàodé Jīng* [《道德经》] while lost in delusion,
mistakenly hoping to extract or employ it—
how could they ever grasp it? Alas!

The *Bīqiú* [比丘] cannot beg for the true *dharma* [法] above,
nor for true sustenance below—
mere hollow title of the *Shìjiā* [释家] to beg for scraps,
not sharing the substance of *Níshān* [尼山]’s elixir fields—
yet they err in application and become petty disciples.
Pitiful!

The *Dàshèng* [大圣] thus manifested in person to teach,
unveiling the true nature of the heart,
laying bare all its contents—
*"Gulu gulu, tumbling out a heap,"*
*"one by one, picking them up for all to see,"*
to show that within this heart are myriad colored forms,
all illusory, none suitable as a medicinal guide.

Like the *zhǐdào* [止盗者] who locks the key and guards it—
better to open the chest and reveal its emptiness.

Thus it is said:
*"All red-hearted, white-hearted, yellow-hearted,
stingy, greedy, fame-seeking, jealous, calculating,
boastful, arrogant, murderous, cruel,
fearful, cautious, deluded—
and myriad other unwholesome hearts,
there is not one black heart among them."*

If you claim this *is* the black heart,
then outside these hearts, there is no black heart at all!

For *rén* [仁], *yì* [义], *lǐ* [礼], and *zhì* [智] arise from the heart—
the Dao-heart.
This heart is the innate nature of all heavens,
the pure knowing of pure ability—
no need to seek further,
only release from the myriad human hearts,
and the Dao-heart reveals itself.

Yet then, what *Mèngzǐ* [孟子] called *"shōufàng xīn"* [收放心],
was not to collect—
to release *is* to collect.

As *Bīqiú Wáng* [比丘王] spoke:
*"Collect it away! Collect it away!"*
Not knowing what use such collection holds within,
thus the Sage knows the essentiality of *wúxīn* [无心],
to cease thought and forget artifice—
unbounded, selfless.

If you take human hearts as the Dao,
and dig for distant traces,
though you expend every drop of vitality,
employ every means—
I know what you truly seek
is merely the black heart.

*"The Prime Minister demands the Dao;
‘I want your black heart.'"*
*(Translation notes: 采取 = "extract" or "employ" in Daoist alchemical context; 鬼神莫测 = "beyond Heaven’s mechanism"; 无我 = "selfless"; 无心 = "heartlessness" or "essence of no-heart"; 昧心错认 = "lost in delusion"; 妄希 = "mistakenly hope"; 好胜心 = "boastful/arrogant heart"; 杀害心 = "murderous heart"; 狠毒心 = "cruel heart"; 无名隐睛之心 = "nameless, hidden-in-the-eyes heart"; 红心/白心/黄心 = "red-hearted/white-hearted/yellow-hearted" [metaphorical terms for different emotional or moral states]; 国丈 = "Prime Minister" [here, a Daoist term for a high-ranking official or master])*

「The Daoist monk protests, *“I am a monk of pure heart—
this Prime Minister is the black-hearted one,
the perfect alchemical ingredient.”*»
Yet it is not that his heart can truly serve as an ingredient,
for if one takes the heart as medicine,
all people share the same heart—
what need to extract *yin* as the drug?
And why grasp the heart as the thing to extract?
Why abandon one’s own heart
and seek another’s?

It is not his true heart that is black and murky,
lost in profound confusion.

The heart, you see,
is the *fire* organ—
its *coagulation* belongs to the *Li* hexagram,
external *yang* yet internal *yin*,
external brightness yet internal darkness.

If one claims the heart itself is the Dao,
even if he practices to the point of *meditative absorption* or *transcendence*,
it remains but a *post-heaven yin* spirit—
not the *pre-heaven yang* spirit.
The fruit is not yet ripe,
and he still falls into the *wheel of rebirth*.

How much worse to mistake falsehood for truth,
to extract *yin* from *yin*,
and to peddle perverse teachings as the Dao?

*"The Great Sage meets the Prime Minister;
the enemy cannot be withstood.
He transforms his body into a streak of cold light,
invades the palace to seize the demoness,
then vanishes as cold light."*

Seeing her ride the wind like a phantom,
pursuing the *yin* path of deceit,
from this moment truth and falsehood can be discerned,
and the deluded ruler’s true nature revealed.

The Tripitaka Master says,
*“How can this shameful face be seen by others?”*
With just this one phrase,
he curses the myriad wicked deeds of all false pretenders in the world.

*The Canon of Supreme Unity* states:
*“The Dao of *yin* abhors the nine-one,
and the turbid chaos disturbs the *bāoyuán* [embryonic essence].
The myriad arts are countless—
ten thousand paths, ten times ten thousand.”*

Peng Zhenren says:
*“Men do not grasp the Dao’s fundamental principle,
but chase after side paths and crooked ways—
these are the myriad arts,
all belonging to *leftist* perversions,
chaos of Heaven’s order.
Those who seek longevity in the True
instead harm their own life.”*

*"The Great Sage and the Eight Rules seek the demon’s lair,
but only see countless willows—
the location of Qinghua [Pure Splendor] Manor remains unknown.
Just as it is said:
‘A thousand leagues of wild fields cannot be fully surveyed,
countless rows of willows vanish without trace.’*

This is the meaning of *“ten thousand paths, ten times ten thousand,”*
*“these belong to the myriad arts.”*

The earth spirit instructs:
*“Under a nine-pronged willow,
turn left three times,
turn right three times,
and call three times, ‘Open the door!’—
then the Qinghua Cave will appear.”*
This is the meaning of *“nine-one,”*
*“turbid chaos,”*
*“crooked paths,”*
*“leftist perversions.”*

The Great Sage follows the words and calls out,
*“In an instant, a resounding crack—
the two doors swing open,
no trace of the trees remains.”*
This is the meaning of *“chasing after side paths,”*
*“perversions,”*
*“chaos of Heaven’s order.”*

*"He sees on the stone screen the words:
‘Qinghua [Pure Splendor] Immortal Manor.’*
The *府* (Manor) is the *fǔ* [viscera],
*qing* like smoke,
*huá* like flowers—
for smoke and flowers blind one,
unaware that it is *“turbid chaos, embryonic essence.”***

*"He sees the old demon clutching a beauty in his arms,
and exclaims, ‘What a fine opportunity!’
The Sage leaps forward, brandishing his staff:
‘Hairy beast! What fine opportunity?’"*

The Great Sage shouts to incite the demon to battle,
while the Eight Rules [Guài] knocks down the willow tree,
causing fresh blood to spurt forth.
This is the *正見御女邪術* (right-seeing to subdue women, perverse Dao/Way), a beastly act of slaughterous intent,
which cannot bring eternal life—
instead, it is *“反傷生”* (backwardly harming life).

Only by penetrating to its root cause,
and eliminating this demonic evil,
can one attain true longevity.
Thus, at the very moment of the battle cry,
the **Southern Pole Old Man Star** (Southern Celestial Longevity Star) unexpectedly arrives.
The Longevity Star smiles and says,
*“Spare this creature’s life, O Two Gentlemen—
it is my match in vitality.”*
This refers to the vitality that grants eternal life—
how could one rashly act to end such a life?

The White Deer reveals its true form,
and pounces to slay the White Fox Demoness.
*“Together, we return to the Bhikṣu [monk], manifesting our forms and transforming into mortals,”*
signifying the Sage’s intent:
to split open the belly, gouge out the heart,
and deliver a sermon in person.
The Great Sage then addresses the king with a smile:
*“This is your Prime Minister,
and this is your Queen.”*
His words strike home with piercing clarity—
how could one not be moved to sweat and shiver in dread!

The king, ashamed and grateful,
with the heart of an ignorant child,
suddenly awakens to remorse and confession,
thus declaring:
*“You have saved a king’s son—
this is true Heaven’s mercy!”*

The Longevity Star explains:
*“I was playing chess with the Eastern Peak Emperor—
the game was not yet finished
when I went to find him.”*

The Longevity Star says:
*“If you return late,
this beast will be no more.”*
And again:
*“I wish to teach you the way of cultivation,
but you are already weak in sinew and spirit,
unable to refine the elixir.
Only these three dates remain—
they were gifts to the Eastern Peak Emperor for tea,
now I give them to you.”*
This passage, which readers might see as mere concluding words,
is in fact the immortal’s urgent admonition at parting,
urging one to hasten cultivation.

Life’s time is fleeting,
worldly affairs like a chess game—
one must cultivate with haste,
never delay.
Do not wait until your sinews weaken and your spirit fails,
for then you cannot refine the elixir.

The “three dates” symbolize:
one, restraining early desires;
two, seeking guidance from a teacher early;
three, beginning practice early.
The Master of Upper Yang declared:
*“Common mortals from seventy to a hundred and twenty years old
can all refine the elixir,”*
encouraging those who are frail in old age.
But here it says:
*“Weak in sinew and spirit,
unable to refine the elixir,”*
warning those who do not exert themselves in youth.
This is also the meaning of Confucius’ words:
*“At forty or fifty, one is still not to be feared,”*
not truly implying that a weak body cannot attain the elixir.

The king pleads for instruction,
and the Sage replies:
*“From now on, curb your lust for desire,
accumulate your hidden merit—
all worldly matters will then lengthen your deficiencies,
sufficient to dispel illness and prolong life.”*
Though the elixir’s method may not be spoken of,
the teaching of lengthening deficiencies is never abandoned.

*“As they leave the city,
suddenly they hear a gust of wind from midair,
and on both sides descend a thousand, one hundred, and ten-one egg baskets—
each household comes forward,
recognizing their children inside,
joyous and delighted,
leaping and laughing,
without distinction of age or gender,
male or female alike,
crowding the master and disciple back into the city.”*

Seeing the compassionate heart of the Sage,
all beings are united as one—
no distinction between great and small.
Once lost in delusion for long,
now awakened in a single day,
they return as if descending from the sky—
each reclaims their child,
no longer ensnared by harm.
What joy like this!

This is the verse:
*“Hidden merit saves a thousand lives,
the child’s city remains—
the Bhikṣu [monk] still prevails.”*

Yet, if the heart holds no medicine,
and one practices the Way of the World,
where should they seek the roots and sprouts?
Thus, the immortal teacher urgently reveals the next section’s teachings.

**The 80th Episode:**
*The Fair Maiden Nurtures Yang to Seek a Mate,*
*The Monkey-King Guards His Master and Discerns Demons.*

The Sage of Awakening says:
*“This chapter, up to the 82nd,
clearly states that cultivators must step by step guard their original nature,
returning to their innate purity.
Even a single misstep
will plunge them into bottomless emptiness,
making liberation difficult.*

At the chapter’s beginning,
the Sage cites an ancient saying:
*“If you seek temporal wealth and honor,
you must exert the effort of transcending death.”*
The Sand Monk says:
*“If you persist in the effort,
there will surely come a day of attainment.”*
Meaning: one must never slacken for a moment.

In the previous chapter,
desire was led astray by external allurements,
but if one can fiercely reflect and return,
it is still easier to restrain.
Now, it is made clear:
desire arises from the heavens,
thoughts spring from within—
these are the hardest to suppress.

The term *“fair maiden”* (姹女)
refers to the utmost essence of the *Kān* [Water] trigram;
*“nurturing yang”* (育阳)
is the yang cultivated within the *Kān* trigram.
*Kān* represents male,
so why is it called female?
Because its outer form is yin-like.
Post-heaven yang is nurtured within the center.”

When the affairs of men are in tumult,
remain ever still and unmoved;
When the heavens decree a tranquil gathering,
you must rise and manifest yourself.

For the marvel of yin and yang,
cycles endlessly without cease,
its utmost subtlety lies at the juncture of *Kūn* [Earth] and *Fù* [Return],
between motion and stillness—
this is the moment of *hài* [Pig]’s end and *zǐ* [Water]’s beginning.

Qu Yuan’s *"Far Roaming"* chapter states:
*"The vital breath is all-pervading and divine,
Within it, the night abides;
Empty and receptive, I await it,
Taking no action before its will."*

Zhu Xi comments:
*"This is what Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor—
nothing more than this."*

Dao cultivators, if they can preserve emptiness and await,
then countering and restraining it—
that is divine;
If they cannot preserve emptiness and await,
but instead comply and indulge—
that is monstrous.

Here lies the critical threshold of life and death,
most worthy of discernment and vigilance.

*"The master and disciples were just conversing leisurely,
when they saw another stretch of dark pine forest.
The Sand Monk said: ‘We have just passed the rugged mountain paths—
how have we come upon this dense black pine grove?
This must be intentional.’*
He further said:
‘Disciples, throughout our journey westward,
countless mountains and forests have been treacherous.
Fortunately, we have reached this tranquil and refined place.’"*

This grove contains strange and wondrous flowers and plants,
pleasing to the heart’s affection!
I wish to rest here awhile.”

But to sit beneath the black pines—
is that not merely to sit beneath the black pines?
The black pines’ shade, the black resting **qi**—
this is the **Dao**-manifestation of motion reaching its peak and seeking stillness.

At the moment of stillness, when one sits with closed eyes,
suddenly movement arises within the quiet—
and then the monstrous and evil **Dao** is born.
In the text, *"suddenly see"* and *"suddenly hear"*—
these are profound mysteries.

*"Only then did I see a beautiful woman bound to a great tree,
her upper half tied with rope to the branches above,
her lower half buried in the earth below."*

This woman is the **yang** essence of the *Kan* hexagram,
at the hour of *Hai*, when it descends from heaven to stir.
*Hai* belongs to **Wood**, hence her upper half is bound to the tree.
*Hai* passes to *Zi*, the hour of **Mouse** essence—
*Zi* belongs to **Metal**, hence she is the **Mouse** essence.
*Zi* ends and gives way to *Chou*, which belongs to **Earth**,
hence her lower half is buried in the soil.

The common man sees this as ordinary,
complies and follows suit—
seeking partners in every direction.

The **Dao** cultivator sees it as strange,
countering and restraining it—
fearing and guarding against its influence.

The immortal master then pointed directly and said, *"Ah! This fellow is clearly a demon—how strange! The venerable elder, with his ordinary mortal eyes, does not recognize it."*

Upon seeing it, one could not help but feel stirred, *"unable to restrain oneself."* The moment a thought of suppression arises, another thought of desire sprouts—pitying and cherishing, lingering along the path. Alas! Alas! *"The practitioner from the side coldly laughs,"* piercing through the demonic deceit, admonishing and restraining, relying entirely on this steadfast and tranquil mind.

*"Suddenly, they arrived at the Zenhai Temple, and once again heard a bell toll."* From the stirring of desire, another thought emerges—like a bronze bell struck, one awakens abruptly, realizing the boundless ocean of craving. Then, suddenly, the unyielding strength of true gold arises, severing and subduing it with resolve.

But why does the bell, though struck on earth, have its upper half like snow and its lower half like indigo? It is said: *"Bronze does not change its sound from external assaults; a man must not lose his resolve from the ungovernable desires of the world."* The Tripitaka Master stroked the bell and sighed, while the Dao cultivator picked up a stone and struck it—both employing the same principle.

Upon entering the temple, they saw *"the front in disarray, the rear in perfect order."* The *"Zen"* here refers to true gold. This steadfast mind, like true gold unchanging, though the front may be in disarray, the rear remains in perfect order—what is there to fear?

Yet this *"nurturing"* is but the cultivation of **yang qi**; this *"seeking"* is but the search for a partner; this *"protecting"* is but the safeguarding of the self. All lead to the profound and wondrous words of the next section.

**Chapter 81: The Mind-Monkey at Zenhai Temple Discerns the Demon; The Three Disciples Seek Master in the Black Pine Forest**

Sun Wukong said, *"This radiant form easily moves one—most difficult to restrain. Fools admire it and lose their lives, while the Sage encounters it and awakens to the True. Only if one sees clearly, knows it for a demon, and resolutely avoids it, can one wield the wisdom-sword, can one be true gold steadfast as Zenhai. If one fails to discern it truly, even a slight attachment—should one stumble over a single grain of rice—one falls into indulgence, unable to conquer with firm resolve, and Zenhai Temple becomes the demon’s lair. The Master takes him to the temple, yet this very act of escorting becomes a burden; summoning the novice monk to lead him to the rear for rest is but to harbor the root of calamity. Vague and entangled, languid and ensnared, like a sick man unable to move forward. It is due to his Dao power being insufficient that he is not cautious at midnight, succumbing to the wind’s blow, unable to proceed on the path. Though his own ailment weighs him down, he still cannot forget the compassionate female Bodhisattva, hoping to bring her food to eat—this is but lingering affection, sinking into the sickness of indulgence. How could he not be trapped along the way, step by step ensnared, desiring to send a letter home and retrace his steps?*

The **Pilgrim** could not help but burst into laughter, saying, *"Master, you are truly inept!"* All suffering stems from the drowsy thought of a single nap, from stumbling over a grain of rice with the left foot.* The left* here means *error*—speaking of those on the Dao path who must not falter by even a grain of rice. If not a Dao cultivator, then one is often erring in the eyes of all beings. The Buddha thus does not concern himself with it.*

You see the monks unable to subdue dragons or tame tigers, unversed in recognizing demons or spirits—within three days, six of them were devoured. Is this not the case of *"the foolish monk led astray by lust, thus losing his life"*?

Only the **Pilgrim** knew of the demon’s cunning and strove to eliminate it, yet still nearly fell into its trap. As for **Tang Seng**, his mind already lost, how could he not be ensnared by the demon and dragged into the **Hollow Mountain**, into the **Bottomless Pit**?

The demon excels in its deceptive allure—its flower-footed illusion, empty-flight lures—none can escape its schemes. Even the **Wise Monkey**, struck by two demonic breaths, dodged only to fall into its trap. How much more so **Tang Seng**, tender and pitying, unaware of danger, suddenly plunged into ruin—this was his inevitable fate.

This was the result of **Tang Seng’s** left-foot misstep over a grain of rice, while the demon, in turn, shed its flowered shoe. I moved with my left, and it met me with its left—left against left—yet a single step’s error led to total ruin. As the saying goes: *"A hair’s breadth difference leads to a thousand-li mistake."*

At that moment, his mind and spirit were in disarray, his homeland unsettled, chaos reigning without direction. Only now did he truly grasp the demon’s true menace.

Earlier, **Tang Seng** had merely thought of sending a letter home to the East, yet his body had not yet moved. Now, his body itself turns back eastward—how could the three disciples fail to follow suit?

For the demon originally arose from the **Black Pine Grove**, suddenly appearing, and must still be sought there. Swiftly setting aside distractions, he must now compose himself, renew his resolve, and earnestly seek salvation.

By uncovering the truth of **Hollow Mountain** and the **Bottomless Pit**, he may learn its whereabouts and act in unison to rescue them—urgent as the wind, swift as the clouds, with no room for delay.

This very entrapment is a trial that **Dao cultivators** must endure. Without falling into the pit, one does not know how easily one might be ensnared. Without falling, one does not grasp the depth of its abyss. Who would have known the **Hollow Mountain’s** bottomless depths, had he not experienced it firsthand?

Thus, the demon’s **Hollow Mountain** and **Bottomless Pit** are the very **realized terrain** of **true practice**.

All illusory forms arise from the spontaneous stirrings of the mind within stillness.

The land spirit pointed toward *"true south,"*—the **Li** trigram above, the **Kan** below. The central line of **Qian** sinks to form **Li**; the central line of **Kun** ascends to form **Kan**. This is the **Kun** yin consuming the **Qian** yang—just as the female demon ensnares the **Elder**.

The character *"flower shoe"* (花鞋) is composed of two *"people"* and two *"earth"* radicals, with *"hua"* (化, transform) and *"ge"* (革,革革,革革革,革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革

Ah! The cunning **flower-shoe demon** slips free from the snare—truly dreadful!

In the **Eighty-Second Chapter**, *"The Maid Seeks Yang"* and *"The Primordial Spirit Guards the Dao"*, Master Wu Yi remarked: This passage cleverly uses the *"Errant Spirit Falls into the Bottomless Pit"* to stage a **sutra**-like performance, with hidden subtleties at every turn.

Those with innate **Daoist** essence can silently guide their **spirit** and **mind**—the **Penglai** and **Eluyuan** lie before them.

Alas! Though the **Soul Mountain** assembly gathers a thousand **Buddhas**, which one can escape this very place?

When **practitioners** reach this juncture, they must swiftly gather their **spirit** and **mind**, resolutely seeking a path beyond. They must devise every means to find an exit.

Here lies a **secret Vajra**—the *"river-crossing ferry, the ladder to heaven"*! The **Ancestral Master** dared not reveal it, so it remains concealed within these **nine-nine** cycles, returning to their beginning.

The **true mechanism** leaps forth, yet is held back—just as **Ziyu** said: *"The capable follow it,"* and here it is!

The *Cansong Contract* states:
*"The river maid, most refined and spirit-like,
Encountering fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace.
Ghosts and dragons hide, none know her whereabouts.
To subdue her, yellow sprouts must be the root."*

The annotation reads: *"Yellow sprouts—i.e., rabbit marrow, the gold within water."*

The **flower-shoe demon** embodies the **Kun** trigram. **Kun** obtains the **Qian** central line to form **Kan**; **Qian** transforms the **Kun** central line to become **Li**. The maid’s pursuit of **Yang** is the natural interplay of **yin** and **yang**.

Those who study the **Dao** must retrieve the **Yang** from within **Kan** and solidify the **Yin** in **Li**, achieving an indestructible **true-gold** body.

Yet once **Yang** is ensnared in **Kan**, it is as if one has fallen into the **Bottomless Pit**—how then can one emerge?

For centuries, those who profane this **sacred text** have failed to grasp what the **Bottomless Pit** truly is—**sin**! **Sin**!

The **Kan** hexagram is void above and void below—clearly, a mountain hollowed with no bottom.

The lecture begins with *"two female demons at the well drawing water."* The well is **Kan**; the demons are the **crawfish**. Two **yin** lines are plainly shown.

Then it says: *"On their heads, they wear a tall, one-foot-two-to-three-inch-high **‘mishu’** (髟狄) knot—quite unfashionable."* These two lines reveal the **secret essence** of refining the **gold elixir**—though the **Daoist Master** has exposed it, mortals fail to recognize.

In **Daoist** practice, one’s **qi** and **nature** must be gentle and yielding—no rigid boundaries. This aligns with **Laozi’s** *"teeth firm, tongue soft"* and the **Dao of War**: *"The virtuous prevail."*

The **practitioner** says: *"Gentleness conquers all; harshness falters even a step."* Again invoking **willow** and **sandalwood** as metaphors, deeply grasping **Laozi’s** meaning.

*"Two demons come here to draw this **yin-yang** copulating water, setting a pure feast"*—the emphasis on *"good"* reveals that without **yin-yang** union, male remains male, female remains female, and *"good"* cannot arise.

*"Male and female copulate, all things transform and generate."* The **Daoist** path is complete.

The **bewildered**, reading this, mistakenly assume it refers to **sexual alchemy**—the farther they stray, the harder it is to find salvation.

When the **practitioner** leaps in, he plunges into *"a fine place indeed—this is a **Tian** realm of bliss!"*

Yet within, one must grasp it firmly—never *"lose true Yang, fall into the wheel of rebirth, and never rise again."* Swiftly seek an exit; do not forget, for it plainly teaches that **birth** comes from **life**, urging **respect** and **truth-preservation**, and to urgently find the **transcendent** union—never abandoning the original path.

**Tripitaka** says: *"I’ve forgotten the way in."*

This reminds all to seek the **ultimate cause** of escape from the very path they entered.

The **practitioner** says: *"Do not speak of forgetting the way—this cave is strange, not meant for easy entry or exit. You came by diving headfirst and descending; now to save you, you must dive from below and ascend."*

Still, *"who knows if you have the skill to dig your way out?"*

Alas!

The **Daoist Master** speaks in subtle, cold tones, pointing to the **sutras** of transcending the world—seeming like a descent to ascend, yet truly not so.

The **discerning eye** understands this here: one may grasp the **Dao** of *"following the natural order to become a sage, or opposing it to forge the elixir."*

The **practitioner** devises a way out, requiring within the wine cup to *"pour forth the blossom of joy"*—transforming into a **worm** to enter the belly, within the **liquid gold** to employ **alchemical techniques**.

Who knows? The blossom has already scattered—nothing can be done.

When the female seeks but the male does not respond, only the female’s heart holds *"Brother, the marvelous one"*—like **Yang** above and **Yin** below, the **Hexagram of *Nòu*** (☱), yet an empty joy. It is the image of *"the eagle soaring, its talons wheeling—upsetting tables and overturning dishes, smashing bowls and plates."*

The **practitioner**, unable to escape, must turn and reenter, shifting to the **strategy of the red suit** (♥), teaching **Tang Seng** the **secret alchemical precepts** of false union.

Later, their words and intentions align, their bond like *"fish and water"*—the **demon** then reveals the **dharma** of *"fruit ripening on the branch, the interplay of Yin and Yang, Sun and Moon."* With tender emotions deepening, the **practitioner** acts in time—*"a single somersault, and he flips into the belly."*

Now the female leads, the male follows—truly *"Brother, the marvelous one"*—as **Yin** above and **Yang** below, the **Hexagram of *Tāi*** (☳), a real belly. The **demon** says: *"Sun Wukong, how did you contrive to burrow into my stomach?"* The **practitioner** replies: *"It’s nothing strange—just eating your six-leaf liver and lungs, the three-hair heart, and all your five **zàng** organs clean, turning you into a **hollowed-out gourd spirit**!"* Within the belly, he *"punches, kicks, braces his limbs, and aligns the four directions,"* nearly tearing apart the skin-sack.

The **demon**, unable to endure the pain, collapses in the dust. When lifted, she says: *"My belly already holds a man! Quickly send this monk out!"*

What meaning do the **scholars** find in this spectacle?

The *"Awakening to Truth"* (悟真篇) states:
*"Though fruit grows on the branch, it must ripen in time—
the child in the womb, how could it differ?"*

This clearly enacts the scene.

One may also perceive the **alchemical marvel** of *"condensing the Five Phases"* and their role in **elixir cultivation**.

When the lesser demons all came to carry him, the monk inside cried out: *"Who dares lift me? If you must, then you yourself must send my master out!"*—a display of innate, unassisted **Dao** power, beyond mortal strength.

The demoness said: *"So long as the bright moon lingers over the Five Lakes, what need is there to fear no place to cast the golden hook? Send this wretch out, and I’ll seek another head elsewhere."* With a leap, she vanished in a flash of light, straight to the cave’s mouth.

Just then, the clatter of weapons rang out—*clink-clank, clink-clank*—in chaotic battle. The monk said: *"That’s Eight Rules wielding his *pá*! Call him once."* The Master then called: *"Eight Rules!"*

Hearing this, Eight Rules replied: *"Master Sand! The Teacher has emerged!"*

To call Eight Rules was to gauge the **fire’s readiness**; to summon Master Sand was to attend to the **refinement’s intent**.

Ah! Just as the verse states:
*"The mind-monkey enters the cave to subdue the demon,
Earth and wood unite at the gate to welcome the holy monk."*

This scene reveals the **alchemical subtlety** of the **elixir emerging from the furnace**.

The three share a single purpose—calculating perils, guarding against danger, ensuring the **principal and auxiliary** roles are fulfilled without neglect.

The **"Maiden of Vermilion"** seeks **yang** as the **Great Dao**,
while the **"Original Spirit"** guards the **Way** with hidden teachings.

All mortals enter her cave—
those who preserve their **True Nature** without drowning,
who calculate their own escape—who can do so?

The lost do not probe the **yin-yang** from the heart,
nor seek a teacher’s guidance to attain the **Supreme Vehicle**.
Instead, they mistake **copulation and domination** as the path,
and thus sow the seeds of **Hell**, never to escape in ten thousand kalpas!

Beware! Tremble!

The preceding chapter laid the roots of those who fall into the cave;
this chapter reveals the **karma and consequences** of those who emerge.

**Chapter 83: The Mind-Monkey Recognizes the Elixir’s Core**
**The Vermilion Maiden Returns to Her True Nature**

The Master of Awakening said:
The **Dao of transcending the world** lies in subduing the **golden essence**.
If one knows the method of subjugation yet lacks cultivation,
and fails to grasp its truth,
then one cannot return to the origin and restore the fundamental.

When **principle and desire** wage war,
they remain separate from **True Nature**,
inevitably **soaring and unrestrained**—
wild and rampant—
leaving one ungrounded.
This is what is meant by:
*"Cultivation insufficient, no square nor round."*

The **Tang Monk’s** repeated fall after escape
arises from incomplete understanding
and untrue attainment.

Thus, the essence of seeking the **elixir**
demands meticulous inquiry into the roots,
to recognize the **core of the elixir**.

The **Celestial Master** feared the world would mistake falsehood for truth,
so he revealed this passage
to discern its subtle profundity.
If one views it merely as *"water’s end and clouds’ ascent,"*
a sudden turn after exhaustion—
merely a literary flourish—
then the author’s **benevolent intent** is buried.

The **Sutra** states:
*"Gold returns to its original nature—
only then may it be called the **Returning Elixir**."*

When the practitioner forces the **peach** into his belly,
compelling the **monkey** to carry the monk out,
it is not from **voluntary harmony** or **natural liberation**.
Thus, upon emerging, he **reassembles his forces**,
engages in chaotic battle,
leaving the **Tang Monk** alone and unsupported—
this violates the **principle of harmonious integration**.
Since the **gold** does not return to **True Nature**,
but **water, fire, earth, and wood** contend,
the **gold** is a false form—
first misplaced on the **left**,
now misplaced on the **right**.
Hence, the **flowered shoe** on the **right foot**
again shifts and cannot settle.

The **essence of the child** is the substance of the **Kan (Abyss)**.
When it emerges from the earth,
it is also called the **Earth-Surging Lady**.
Have you not heard of the **Earth-Surging Golden Lotus**?
The **Golden Lotus** is the **Lady’s delicate toes**,
adorned with **flowered shoes**.

The **shoes**, clinging to the **Kun (Receptive, earth)**, walk—
this is **returning to True Nature**.
When cast off and rising into emptiness,
it is **soaring and unrestrained**—
the **gold** does not return to **True Nature**.

The **left** belongs to **yang**, the **right** to **yin**.
Previously, **excessive yang** spun left—
yet the **left was false**.
Now, **excessive yin** spins right—
yet the **right is false**.

**"Shoes"**—a **play on words**.
How can **left and right** scatter?
Thus, one cannot **stand firmly on the earth**,
cannot remain steady.

「Yet the **Xīnniǔ (Maiden of Beauty)** is my true nature, so why call her a **démon (妖)**?

**Returning to True Nature** is the **True Essence (真精)**,
while **departing from True Nature** becomes the **Démonic Essence (妖精)**.
**Returning to True Nature** makes me **whole in truth**,
while **departing from True Nature** turns me into a **démon’s essence**,
and I fall into its snare.

*"The Tang Monk was seized and held in one embrace,
his reins severed—both man and horse were dragged away."*
All because he could not subdue the **True Gold (真金)**,
his roots were not firm, and his reins were broken.

The **Tang Monk’s steed’s** strength in its hooves
was never greater than the **Démonic Essence’s flowered shoes**,
so it must be tamed and made its foundation.

The **Great Sage** saw the half-severed reins,
and felt helpless sorrow welling up—
tears streamed from his eyes.
He turned swiftly, with fierce resolve,
seeking the origin’s root,
only then could he find true remedy.

Seeing the **Golden Character Tablet (金字牌)**,
he recognized his father’s and elder brother’s names,
and thus knew the **Dan (丹, cinnabar)**—
was he not filled with joy?

If his father **returned to True Nature**,
where could his son go?
He **clutched the Tablet** and ascended to the **Heavenly Palace (天堂)**,
to **report to the Jade Emperor (玉帝)**,
and thus his kin could be saved.

This is the **strategy of capturing the thief by seizing the king’s hand**,
the **key to tracing origins and uncovering roots**.

When the **Jade Emperor** commanded **Tai Bai (太白, the Great White Star)** to summon **Li Tianwang (李天王, the Heavenly King of the Li clan)** to the **court of judgment (对簿)**,
the Heavenly King failed to recognize her as a **female**,
and **Ne Zha (哪吒)** revealed her lineage—
*"The thief from the Sacred Mountain stole the Buddha’s fragrant flowers and lamps."*
Only then did he realize she was his **sworn sister (结拜)** by fate.

Yet how could she be a **sworn sister**,
if she was born of his clan?
The Heavenly King bears the **Li (李) surname**,
which belongs to **wood (木)**.
By the **wood’s children (木之子)**, **fire (火)** is meant,
so how could his daughter be of **gold (金)**,
with a **golden nose and white fur (金鼻白毛)**?

A **golden form throughout her body**?
He did not know that **gold in water (水中之金)** can subdue wood,
yet **gold** also **engenders water (生水)** to nourish wood;
that **fire in wood (木中之火)** can restrain gold,
yet **fire** also **engenders earth (生土)** to give rise to gold.

The grudge came first, then the bond—
thus she became his **sworn sister** by fate.

The *Awakening to Truth* says:
*"The Gold Prince was once the Eastern House’s son,
sent to the Western Neighbor to take root and be reborn.
Recognized and called back to his ancestral home to be nurtured,
paired with a radiant maiden as kin by fate."*
Within lies a hidden marvel of inversion—
words cannot fully capture its depth.

Why call her **"Half-Observed Guanyin"**?
Guanyin is **water and moon**—
without water, no moon’s fullness.
The radiant maiden is but **gold in water**—
is she not half?

Now, *"the essence lies in the southeast black horn with its hidden aperture,"*
and the gold returns to its original nature in the Eastern House—
just as the nuptial chamber’s candles glow,
**black qi swirling, faint fragrance perfuming the air**—
the moment of perfect union.

*"The Pilgrim found Tang Sanzang and his horses and baggage,"*
and the **foot-strength** was already prepared.
This old demon, with no path left,
knelt in submission—
the Heavenly King and Prince escorting the demon back to the palace.

From now on, Tang Sanzang and his four disciples
may ride horses, carry burdens, and march onward along the Great Path.

Thus, those refining the **elixir** must first subdue and temper the **golden essence**,
enduring unyielding, unbroken—
only then can the **foot-root** stand firm,
and only then may they advance westward.

Now, these sentient beings drown in the **sea of desire** without repentance,
burn in the **pit of wrath** without cleansing,
fall into the **trap of greed** without complaint,
plunge into the **abyss of fame** without awakening,
sleep drunk in the **moat of death** without waking,
stray on the **path of delusion** without returning,
entangled in the **net of glory** without escape—
all blinded to their true nature, sinking into emptiness,
with no end in sight.

Alas!

The previous chapter concealed the true gold in **Zhenhai Temple**,
this one reveals the **golden position** and **golden furnace** as recognizing the **elixir’s essence**.
What is transcended: the **golden lotuses** on either side;
what is subdued: the **white-furred golden nose**.
Speak of this inner true gold—
it is the **elixir’s supreme secret**, not to be overlooked.

---
**Eighty-fourth Chapter**
*"The Unquenchable Flame of Gajidhara’s Great Awakening"*
*"The Law-King’s Natural Perfection"*

A disciple of enlightenment says:
This passage speaks only of **all dharmas being empty**,
with no attachment—
thus the great meaning is fulfilled.

Humanity’s nature is **originally round and awakened**,
with no division between self and others.
When **self and dharma** arise, division appears.
If **self has no dharma**, others extinguish my nothingness;
if **others possess dharma**, I extinguish their dharma with my own.
Only when **self and others both lack dharma**,
and the **heavenly body** is perfectly round,
does **Great Awakening** emerge.

In the **Dao**,
**insight** is the **gateway to marvel**,
**stillness** the **true essence**,
**wise thought** the **armor and shield**,
**discriminating wisdom** the **sword and spear**.
Breaking the **inner demon’s high ramparts**,
crushing the **outer foe’s fortified ranks**,
pacifying the chaotic and explaining the ensnared.

Deeply knowing that **form and substance** cannot long endure,
yet the **true spirit** persists through countless eons.
Understanding **transformation’s impermanence**,
the **abiding** lies only within myself.

Not originally **dharma**, it cannot be spoken of as dharma;
not originally **teaching**, it cannot be transmitted as teaching.
As it is said:
*"Round and red, not a thread nor a hair."*

Yet within it lies a **foundation of firm footing**—
if one drifts like a rudderless boat,
lost in empty vagueness,
the Buddha calls it **"vague and empty"**—
still, it is the plight of falling into the **bottomless abyss of emptiness**.

Confucius said:
*"One may stand with him, but not yet be entrusted with authority."*
Only when one can **stand firm** may one speak of **authority**.

The immortal master opened his mouth to say:

*"The Three Treasures clings to the Original Yang,
escaping the bottomless demonic pit—
followers must advance westward!"*

This is when one’s **foundation is firmly established**,
the moment one may **stand firm**.

Yet still, it is not yet sufficient.
Thus, the text suddenly presents an aged mother’s loud cry:
*"Monk, do not proceed!
Westward lies only the path of death!"*

This great sage, with his **compassionate vessel**,
splits the path with a single strike—
blocking the way, he makes clear:
*"Not to blend with the mundane,
nor to follow the round and square—
one step is unworkable!"*

Now, observe the **Destruction of the Dharma-realm** at hand,
uttering the **wish of ten thousand monks**,
slaying the **nameless**,
awaiting only the **named**—
until the ten thousand are gathered,
plainly pointing out that **all dharma is but an empty shadow**.

The Three Treasures then sought a **skillful path** to pass through,
but the aged mother laughed:
*"You cannot pass!
You cannot pass!"*

In that laughter, she rejoiced at his **not taking a direct route**,
and mocked his **twisting and turning in vain**.
One must walk the **middle path**—
there lies a **skillful gate**,
to traverse through;
do not stray into **devious side paths**,
lest you lose your way entirely.

Thus again he hurriedly called out to stop them.

For **skillful means** are not contrary to the **Way** itself,
but rather, to weigh the **light and heavy** along the **true path**,
to bend one’s heart without abruptness—
thus must one **seek the Dao** until the journey’s end.

Since the **Han dynasty** onward, none have truly understood its meaning,
and so they abandon the **middle path** to take **devious side paths**—
how could they align with **reason**?

Those who cannot uphold the **Way** invariably enter **erroneous paths**,
and cloak their **skillful means** in pretense to justify their **deviance**;
while those who practice **skillful means** in truth
must follow the **right path**, transforming the **Way** to serve the **orthodox**.

This is the **true skillful gate** of the **middle path**—
the **skillful means** of **sages, immortals, and Buddhas**.

Past readers of *Journey to the West* have seen the **Great Sage’s** appearance
as mere literary exhaustion, unable to grasp these **cool, idle words**—
all profound in meaning.

**Dao** is that which **does nothing yet nothing remains undone**.
Its **substance** is **emptiness and non-being**,
its **function** is **following and adapting**.
Without fixed form, without enduring shape,
it thus explores the **emotions of all things**;
neither preceding nor following things,
it thus becomes the **master of all things**.

With **dharma** or without **dharma**, it acts according to the **time**;
with **precepts** or without **precepts**, it harmonizes with **sentient beings**.
Thus it is said:
*"The sage is imperishable, for he guards with the times."*
And again:
*"Change and move without abiding, shifting with the flow of the age."*
This is the **true intent** of the **Great Sage’s** westward journey to guide the world.

The instruction having been made clear,
he turned straight back to the **Southern Seas**.

The **Pilgrim** then concealed his name to avoid danger,
transforming into a **moth-lantern** to advance by the **light**,
observing carefully and acting in accordance with the **opportunity**;
when the **Way** was clear, he changed his attire,
imitating the **disguise of a humble servant** in the **Song dynasty**—
truly blending with the mundane, not clinging to his own form.

He surveyed every detail of the inn’s guests,
attentive to the **hardships of the world**,
the **innkeeper’s wife** with child
adopting the **common guise** of the age;

seizing the moment to **steal**,
exploiting the situation to **play tricks**,
stirring the **true essence of Heaven’s machinations**,
revealing a **lively and spirited** manifestation of **qi**.

*"Disguised as a commoner near the city,
altering my name to suit the official’s register;
a **horse merchant**, with ten brothers;
a **Han man** leading horses into the shop,
a **woman** inviting guests upstairs;
asking for the **lamps** to examine the **wares**,
boasting of my **horse numbers**,
praising my **room’s breadth**;
negotiating the **room fee**,
discussing the **price of meals**;
calling for the **slaughter of livestock**,
stumbling on the **threshold**;
setting the **taboo day** for **abstinence**,
opening the **shop on the next day**;
**young mistress**, you’ll come tomorrow;
where shall I sleep? Leaning against the **counter**;
**daughter** holding a **child**, speaking close by;
no **buying or selling**, just a **horse merchant**;
wanting to **sleep in darkness**, there’s a **large counter**;
covering it with a **blanket**, come early."*

This is all the art of conforming to human nature and worldly affairs, revealing how the Wayfarer transcends self-attachment and adapts with boundless flexibility—*"able to wield an unimpeded mind, entering all things universally. Seeing without defilement, knowing without grasping. This is called true seeing, also called liberated knowing. The Buddha perceives beyond birth and death, all dharmas thus equal."*

Ah! Without worldly law, there is no Buddhist law—realizing that no-mind is the Dao-mind. The most subtle part is the *"Entering the Counter to Stir Ghosts"* passage.

Laozi says: *"A skilled merchant hides his goods as if empty."* If one has no worldly possessions, why not feign emptiness while revealing substance? Boldly brandishing the law like a torch, one knows the peril of being caught in darkness by light; robbing the horse merchant reveals the danger of arrogance inviting theft.

The law’s net is dense—everywhere, one must beware. All are the Wayfarer’s embodied teachings.

At this stage, the Great Sage displays boundless, transcendent transformations—left arm, right arm, left as right, nothing unsuited. Manipulated on the palm, left and right flow effortlessly. Thus, a single shake of the Golden Hoop scatters across the six directions; gathering into truth, it retreats into the hidden.

*"Form and spirit both perfect, harmonizing with the Dao’s truth—thus able to multiply the body into countless transformations, pluck a hair to forge countless weapons."* From the highest palaces and ministries to the lowest officials and commoners, noble or lowly, great or small—spontaneous divine power shifts forms and moves emotions.

This is the Wayfarer’s body transforming into a blade, shaving every hair clean, making self and others one, all rounded into perfection, unrestricted movement, natural as heaven—is this not like one suddenly awakening from a dream?

Ah! Destroying law through law, revering law to attain law—law has no fixed form. Such is its nature.

The Eighty-Fifth Chapter: The Heart-Monkey Envious of the Wood Mother, the Demon King’s Scheme to Devour Zen

The Sage said: This chapter—readers may say that the earlier demons were beyond comparison, but this one is merely ordinary, as if hastily written. Yet what seems unremarkable is truly wondrous: what can be thought of is not what should be thought at all.

The previous section exposed the emptiness of human nature and worldly affairs, revealing all dharmas as void. One must blend with the world, adapting to circumstances—whether square or round—though outwardly responding to events, yet rooted in the boundless luminosity of the heart’s essence. Fearful that others might not perceive this from the heart, the Immortal Master forcefully turns outward to inward, emphasizing the profound intent of *"The Heart Sutra is not to be sought far away,"* urging one to recognize this heart and never harbor the slightest obstruction, lest one fall into demonic snares.

For the Holy Heart is like a mirror-still pool—ever luminous, ever tranquil, ever responsive yet ever still. All uses arise from its singular essence, and its essence never strays from all uses. Thus it is said: *"The body of wisdom is silent and still, its function radiant and suchness."*

Yet if even a speck of obstruction arises, the heart’s essence grows murky and clogged, and its outer functions become deceitful—like mist veiling the soul’s faculties, where Zen is swallowed whole, as though dense fog concealed within the transparent layers of the *Lianhuan Cave*, shattering the sky-piercing pillars!

Thus the next section is titled: *"Hidden Mist Mountain, the Broken Peak, the Linked-Ring Cave."* The Five Peaks are the celestial pillars; the One Heart is the master of the body. When the peaks collapse, the sky lacks support; when the heart is obscured, the body loses its root. Actions unrooted in the heart become nothing but afflictions—what Zen remains?

Zen seeks to dissolve demons; the staff is wielded to subdue them. Yet how does the demon wield the staff and devour Zen? Zen stills but one mind, while the demon traverses the Six Realms. To bind Zen and extinguish dharma is for the demon to govern demons—how can it avoid becoming a gluttonous maw, greedily consuming living Zen?

Why? Because following desire is not Zen-mind. It splits into precepts, concentration, and wisdom—expanding into the Six Perfections, dispersing into myriad practices. Zen is but one of the Six Perfections—how can it encompass all dharmas? Few escape becoming demonic.

Moreover, Zen-mind is hard to purify, and the golden and wooden essences remain unmelted. How could one then reject all existence and eliminate all dharmas without falling into calculation? If all dharmas are void, it is not that there are no dharmas. The heart gives rise to all dharmas yet does not belong to them. Those who attain it find dharma at their command, verified from the heart, arising as desired—neither identical nor different, neither different nor identical; neither dharma nor non-dharma, neither non-dharma nor non-non-dharma. How could one seek it by clinging to traces?

Dharma is like a tuft of hair. External dharmas are like the body’s bearing—without dharma, it is a loss of decorum. The opening lines, spoken by the ministers, plainly state *"loss of decorum."* Yet the subtlety of dharma’s empty nature is beyond those who cling to worldly dharmas. The minister says, *"I do not know,"* the king replies, *"Indeed, you do not know,"*—each weeping profusely, truly pitiful.

When the king repents of killing and the entire kingdom takes refuge, changing *"destroying dharma"* to *"revering dharma,"* it embodies the principle *"The Buddha has no fixed form; no abiding birth-mind."* For clinging to dharma is to destroy dharma; not clinging to dharma is to revere dharma. Thus sitting in Zen is sitting as Buddha; sitting as Buddha is killing Buddha. Clinging to dharma is fixing the mind; a fixed mind is demonic mind.

The Elder on horseback joyfully declared, *"Wukong, this principle is excellent, of great merit."* Already, all dharmas return to One—every aspect radiates the Dao’s essence. Sha Wujing immediately continued, *"Brother..."*

「Where could one find so many artisans of such craft?」
In the secular world, this is called *"losing decorum"* (失仪); in the Buddhist law, it is called *"crafting appearances"* (整容).
Though seemingly opposed, they mutually complement each other—such is the law’s refusal to be rigidly fixed.
This is the principle that *dharma has no fixed form*, its transformations boundless, its wondrous play unfolding through roots and mind.

The Pilgrim recited this once, then swiftly chanted the four lines of the *Heart Sutra’s Preface* (《多心经》四句《颂子》):
*"The Buddha is not sought afar on Spirit Mountain—
Spirit Mountain stands within your own mind.
Each person has a Spirit Mountain stupa—
Practice beneath it, and you shall find."*

The Tang Monk said, *"All scriptures and teachings boil down to cultivating the mind."*
*"When the mind is pure, clarity shines alone;
When the mind harbors dharma, all worlds grow clear.
A moment’s negligence breeds slackness—
No success in ten thousand years, no matter how long.
But with a single thread of true sincerity,
The Voice of Thunder resounds right before your eyes."*

This *"mind"* is the very focus of the two preceding passages.

The Monkey was of the *Jin-Water Hour* (金水), the Pig of the *Hai-Wood-Fire Hour* (亥木火)—
Though they clash, they also complete each other.
The Monkey, laboring yet weary, harbors resentment from exhaustion;
The Pig, slack from idleness, deceives through comparison.
Below, it was precisely this negligence and lack of sincerity that caused the error—
Thus the sudden rise of wind and mist.

*"Eight Rules [of Conduct] shirks duty,
The Pilgrim deceives him, calling demons ‘good’ and mist ‘qi.’
Steamed rice, flatbread, vegetables—
Little eaten, but the mouth complains.
The horse must be fed first—
Fresh grass sought before its meal.
Fine food for the handsome, coarse for the ugly;
Mumbling ‘Great Sage!’ from his lips."*

Their words ring hollow, deceit between them—
Greedy, lazy, mouth and heart misaligned—
Is this not falling into the *Circle of Demonic Illusions*?

Had the Pilgrim not turned his mind inward and secretly intervened,
Their hidden deceit and broken precepts would have sealed their fate.
Thus, when the heart’s sincerity is absolute, demons retreat;
When the mind wanders, demons manifest.
Demons are not external—they are shadows summoned by one’s own heart.

Observe how the Pilgrim and Eight Rules were deceived by the clear wind and mist—
The demon, to deceive them, gathered the wind and dispersed the mist.
When the Pilgrim and Eight Rules sought to eat the offering,
The demon demanded the monk instead;
When the Pilgrim spoke of steamer’s vapor,
The demon scraped the pot to steam the monk.
Eight Rules and the Pilgrim disguised themselves as a short monk and false Pilgrim—
The demon became a false demon in return.
The Pilgrim employed the *Divided Body Technique*—
The demon countered with the *Sliced Plum Blossom Scheme*.
When the Pilgrim saw the demon defeated and turned back,
The demon retreated to its cave, silent and still.
The Pilgrim called Eight Rules *"Vanguard General"*—
The demon anointed a minor demon as *"Scout."*

Sincerity makes *Chan* the master, swallowing demons;
Negligence makes demons the master, devouring *Chan*.
Like the pole’s shadow or echo in the valley—
Blurred, indistinguishable.
*Chan* or *demon*?
One or two?

The demon bound the Tang Monk to a tree,
And the woodcutter likewise bound to the tree,
Each speaking of loyalty to lord and filial piety—
Their deepest, most sincere words.

The tree, with roots and branches,
Is the foundation of all things.
A just ruler and filial parent are the great Dao of heaven and earth,
While loyalty and filial virtue are the roots of human nature—
Both spring from the true nature of the heart,
Adorned with no false pretense or artifice.

To bow in devotion, serving with utmost loyalty,
And to nurture life while honoring death—
Not betraying the lord’s grace—
This is the true attainment of the sacred scripture.

To exhaust one’s strength in filial duty,
Nurturing life and honoring death—
Repaying the debt of parental kindness—
This is the true reverence for the living Buddha.

If one does not act from the root of true nature,
But instead feigns loyalty and filial piety in outward show,
Then it is like the hidden leopard of Aiyue Mountain,
Wielding the staff of demon-subduing in reverse—
Devouring *Chan* while disguised as virtue.

Lost in the root, cloaked in false filiality as demon—
How easily one may be lamented and defeated!

Oh, Three Treasures and woodcutter—
How could they not be moved to sorrow and grief?

The profound meaning leaps beyond the text,
Beyond the strokes of the brush.

Is it plain?
Or wondrous?
Can it be contemplated and imitated?
Or is it beyond contemplation and imitation?

The Eighty-Sixth Episode: *Mu* Mother Aids in Subduing the Fiend
*Jin* Father Applies the Dao to Exterminate the Demon

*Wu Yi Zi* said: This continues from the previous section, speaking of the Dao/Way being obscured by *Chan* (meditation).

Due to negligence and deceit, one must diligently awaken and discipline oneself—never allowing the slightest falsehood or pretense—then can one penetrate the inner and outer, and comprehend the interconnected cycles of cause and effect.

*"Hidden Mist Mountain, the Aiyue Leopard’s Linked and Pierced Illusion"*—its meaning was clarified earlier.

The one who calls himself *"Nan Shan Da Wang"* (Southern Mountain King), *Nan* (south) being the *Li* (trigram of wood) and belonging to the heart—
*"For hundreds of years, I have roamed here"*—speaks of his demonic form arising from long indulgence of the heart, hence he is singled out to refute his arrogance by invoking Laozi, the Buddha, and Confucius, the three great sages of the teachings.

The Fifth Patriarch said:
*"The body is the Bodhi tree, the mind the mirror platform.
Ever diligently wipe and polish it,
Lest dust gather upon it."*

Further still:
*"Bodhi has no tree, the mirror no platform.
Originally, there is no single thing—
Where could dust gather upon it?"*

Though their exhortations differ in tone,
both illuminate the mind’s proper clarity and purity.

The boar belongs to *Hai* (the eleventh earthly branch), *Hai* being wood;
the monkey belongs to *Shen* (the ninth earthly branch), *Shen* being metal.
When out of harmony, metal subdues wood, creating jealousy;
when in harmony, metal generates water to nourish wood,
and the fire within wood generates earth to foster metal—
thus it aids.

Metal and wood have both restraining and fostering relationships.
Metal becomes true gold when refined by water and fire;
wood thrives when nourished by metal and water.
The original pairing of husband and wife
never truly departs.

When husband and wife live in harmony, the household prospers;
when metal and water are balanced, the body and life align—
this is the Dao/Way of water’s inherent tranquility,
which calms inner and outer, repelling chaos.
Thus, the demon is subdued from this very source.

Yet though the demon comes from without,
its true origin lies within the mind.
So whatever the mind creates,
the demon knows;
whatever the demon creates,
the mind knows.

The practitioner recognizes this as *"the Plum Blossom’s Divided Petal Strategy"*,
and also knows *"the demon’s dwelling is here—my master must be in this very place"*,
both insights arising from the mind’s own discernment.

Yet the most perilous deception is when the false resembles the true—
like the demon crafting a human head from a willow tree,
which is easily discerned as false;
but far more treacherous is when it mimics the true,
such as the demon fashioning a fresh human head as the master,
seemingly real yet not—
most difficult to recognize.
Thus the practitioner brothers failed to perceive and wept together in lament.

The distinction between true and false is subtle,
yet the root of right and wrong is easily confused.

But why did they weep as one?
Was it because the practitioner truly believed in the illusion
and led the crowd in grief?

Sorrow can turn black silk to green or yellow,
and diverging paths can lead east or west.
Their unified weeping holds profound meaning!

Only through great lamentation
can one either mistake the false for the true,
or seek the true while abandoning the false.
How so?

Weeping is the mind’s pain—
with sound and tears, both arise from genuine sincerity,
able to awaken true awareness.
The demon confuses me with falsehood,
but I master it with truth—
then evil cannot overcome righteousness,
and the demon vanishes.

Thus, *"Strive forward, shatter the Stone Gate!"*
and the fortress collapses.

Those who once sought ease and slacked in discipline,
now suddenly rouse courage and sharpen their resolve—
the Southern Mountain King’s reckless form
can no longer be fully comprehended!

Before, the practitioner raised a false doppelgänger to summon the demon;
now, he employs a true doppelgänger to dispel it—
*"Strike from without, slay from within the ranks,"*
united force and will, inner and outer assault—
overthrowing the scheming *Cang Lang* (blue wolf),
blocking the long-indulgent old fiend,
then calming the *qi* and preserving the mind,
examining its gateways,
penetrating its origins and currents,
slipping unseen into its lair—
true and false now fully revealed,
great demons and small, all trembling in confusion.
What fear could there be of its plots and harm?

Recognizing it as demonic,
refining its essence to true insight,
all fiends fall, instantly silenced—
its original form exposed,
and the false paths shattered.

Only then does the true manifest,
the false perish,
its roots severed, its form laid bare.
The Aiyue Leopard’s superficial illusions are removed,
and my true mind remains unharmed.
This is how the woodcutter’s filial devotion,
moving heaven and earth,
escaped death and glimpsed his mother’s true nature.

The woodcutter said:
*"Now the mountain is at peace,
and I may travel through the night."*
And again:
*"This path leads west for less than a thousand *li*."*

Ah!

The inner and outer as one,
penetrating through surface and depth—
how near we stand to the Land of Ultimate Bliss!
This is the Dao’s true measure.

**Chapter Eighty-Seventh: The Phoenix Immortal County—Defying Heaven’s Drought, the Great Sage Sun Wukong Urges Benevolence to Bring Rain**

The Awakened One said:
*"This passage reveals that those who cultivate the True Way must first amass hidden virtue.
Before hidden virtue is complete,
even a beautiful name is useless,
and a half-finished deed collapses.
Ghosts and spirits cannot silently aid,
and all deeds remain hollow pretense.
One must urgently turn inward and reflect,
awaken boundless compassion,
observe strict discipline with diligent progress,
and widely cultivate hidden virtue.*

*What is hidden virtue?*
Cultivating one’s own *heaven* to honor others’ *heaven*—this is hidden virtue;
acting secretly with skillful means—this is hidden virtue;
giving without expecting repayment—this is hidden virtue;
accumulating goodness unknown to others—this is hidden virtue;
not forcing others into peril—this is hidden virtue;
concealing others’ flaws—this is hidden virtue.

The *sutra* says:
*'When they bring calamity, I bring fortune;
When they bring enmity, I bring virtue.'*
All these are deeds of hidden virtue,
boundless in dispelling disasters and karmic retribution.

*The Awakening of the True* says:
*'Great joy lies in what is easy to know,'*
for knowledge comes from both self and *heaven*.

If one does not accumulate deeds and hidden virtue,
demons and fiends will obstruct at every turn.
For though one’s fate is not entirely by *heaven*,
it lies in the marvel of creation within oneself;
and though it is also by *heaven*,
the silent power of reflection rests with *heaven*.

The practitioner says:
*'Only by amassing merit and virtue can I grant you this great rain,'*
—this is the essence of this passage.

The name *'Phoenix Immortal County'* signifies a land of transcendent virtue,
yet now it fails to accumulate hidden merit while boasting hollow fame.
Though it claims to love the people outwardly,
it secretly harms them.
With the people’s lives hanging in peril,
how can the true ruler appease *heaven’s* wrath?

Yet the county magistrate, *Shangguan*,
is *'tenfold in his uprightness'* and *'deep in his love for the people.'*
His plea for rain to save the people is a deed of boundless goodness—
how then does he fail to move *heaven*?

It is said:
*'This is outward virtue, not hidden virtue.'*

For though he is *'tenfold in his uprightness,'*
he is too bright, too rigid in righteousness—
like the fierce *yang* force,
and thus *'unbenevolent.'*
The *Hongfan Transmission* says:
*'If bright, then drought.'*
Brightness is *yang* force unbalanced by *yin* to harmonize it.
Without *yin*’s nourishing flow,
the land’s vitality cannot penetrate deep,
human efforts falter below,
and *heaven’s* response manifests above—
drought is its sign.

Thus, rulers must embody benevolence and relief,
widely practice hidden virtue,
and not prize mere clarity as wisdom.

The sages have said:
*'Brightness without compassion is worse than ignorance.'*
Yao’s three pardons,
Yu’s descent from his chariot,
Tang’s release of the fishnets—
all were brightness tempered by compassion.

Officials who receive *heaven’s* bounty,
holding their posts by imperial command,
must cherish the land and its people—
this is their duty.
What virtue do they possess?

True virtue is known only to *heaven*,
not to mortals.
Yet when *'three years ago, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month,
Shangguan’s household overturned the vegetarian offerings for the gods to feed dogs,
and spoke blasphemous words, defying *heaven,’*
this was hidden evil—
known only to *heaven*, not to men.

The people are *heaven’s* creation;
*heaven* loves all it creates.
If a ruler embodies *heaven’s* heart in loving the people,
he will surely receive *heaven’s* hidden reward—
this is an unchanging principle.

To love the people must begin with revering *heaven*,
hence the saying: *'Revere *heaven* and diligently tend the people.'*
Now Shangguan cannot revere *heaven* but instead profanes it—
no greater crime exists!

For the people, food is *heaven*.
The offerings are what the people rely on for sustenance,
the foundation *heaven* uses to nourish them.
To overturn them for dogs is to deceive and extinguish both *heaven* and the people—
what greater lack of benevolence could there be?

Thus, a thousand outward good deeds
cannot outweigh one hidden evil act.

Hence the Sage is cautious in public and vigilant in solitude,
while the virtuous man guards his private conduct.

For *yin* is the realm of solitary knowledge,
and *virtue* is what one attains in the heart.
It is neither name-seeking nor reputation-chasing.

When the roof leaks, the streets become thoroughfares;
in dreams, night merges with day.
Spirit and breath silently commune with the imperial throne—
the speed of response surpasses even drumbeats!

Yet the one who has incurred *heaven’s* wrath is the magistrate—
how then does disaster descend upon the common folk?

The magistrate is the wind, the people the grass:
if the magistrate is unbenevolent, the people become unrighteous.
Above and below follow in kind—
*qi* and kindred natures resonate.
Day and night, his guilt festers into the people’s hidden anxieties;
a single moment of irreverence spreads as fate’s blessing or ruin for all.

If the magistrate creates it, the people will love him—
this is the natural order of cause and effect.

Thus, extraordinary local calamities
must stem from those in power losing virtue—
and this drought, defying *heaven*, is entirely deserved.

Yet *heaven’s* heart is supremely benevolent,
slow to punish evil to allow repentance,
and swift to reward goodness to encourage virtue.

There are also the appropriate urgencies of *yin* and *yang*:
hidden virtue is delayed to await accumulation and magnify its reward,
while hidden evil is swiftly met to demonstrate *heaven’s* response and confirm its retribution.

For *yang* is known to all,
while *yin* is known only to *heaven*.
Though there are differences in urgency,
there is not the slightest error.

When intent is absolute and aligned,
it is not *heaven* that calls—
but the person who summons their own fate."*

Thus, when one defends their position, the mountains of rice and flour collapse in an instant, towering twenty zans high—
their crimes are as vast as mountains and valleys, beyond reckoning!

When feeding dogs, the roosters are already clenched-mouthed, slow-mouthed,
long-tongued or short-tongued, behaving like beasts and accumulating sins too deep to purge!

When offending others, the golden chains remain unbroken, yet a single lamp’s flame
cannot be extinguished—its punishment knows no end!

Yet still, one evil deed can corrupt a hundred virtues,
while one act of goodness can redeem a hundred evils.

The Four Heavenly Masters addressed the Great Sage with a smile and said:
*"This matter can only be resolved through goodness.
If you but turn your heart from evil to good,
shaking the heavens above,
then the mountains of rice and flour will topple at once,
the chains and rods will break without delay—
go and persuade him to repent, and blessings will follow naturally."*

For evil and virtue both originate from oneself—
to abandon evil and embrace virtue lies solely in one’s own hands.
If only one sincerely reflects and turns toward goodness,
then evil can be transformed into virtue,
calamity into fortune.

The Dragon King cannot act out of favor,
the Great Sage cannot act out of strength,
nor can the heavens force a man—
only the three signs of warning are shown to admonish.

If he truly repents with earnest heart,
broadly cultivating hidden virtue,
then the fierce flames shall turn to sweet dew,
the star-mountains shall crumble into drifting clouds;
the rooster’s tongue of retribution shall be silenced,
the dog’s tongue of blame shall be cut short;
fire shall cease to blaze,
the cords of punishment shall dissolve into nothingness.

In an instant, the heavens descended sweet rain,
each drop falling without fail—how swift its arrival!
The spirits and deities also parted the clouds and mists,
each revealing their true form.

It moves the heavens and earth,
stirs the ghosts and gods—
is this not wrought by a single change of the virtuous heart?
Thus, the temple is named **"Sweet Rain Universal Salvation Monastery."**

In the pursuit of the Elixir,
those who do not repent and cultivate hidden virtue
are like cooking sand for rice or using bamboo to point at the moon—
their efforts shall never bear fruit!
How then does it earn the name **"Universal Salvation"?**

Yet the Sage Master holds a profound secret,
concealed within the transitions of this chapter.
The previous chapter expounded the emptiness of all phenomena;
enlightenment of the heart and true nature—
inner and outer as one, subtly perfect and harmonious—
is already the Buddha’s presence in this land.
Where else might one labor to attain?

The woodcutter said, *"That great path lies not far to the west."*
Why then is this not a resting place,
but rather a waypoint still traversed?
For accumulating virtue and refining power
is merely the work of those in the early stages of cultivation—
why speak of it when enlightenment and clarity are already attained?
Yet few know of the wondrous Dao residing between.

Observe the opening verse:
*"The Great Dao is profound and subtle—
how can it be fathomed?
It embraces the cosmos,
splits the hidden gateways—
its joy surpasses all in the world.
The spirit soars before the sacred peak,
a gem plucked from its treasure,
radiant with fivefold brilliance.
Piercing through heaven and earth,
all beings above and below—
the wise live as long as mountains and seas."*

These words encapsulate the essence of the Elixir’s purpose;
even the ghosts and gods are startled by its revelation.
How much more so for mortals?
Thus, it is not spoken aloud.
Only when the nature-body is firm
can one refine the Elixir;
only when hidden virtue is deep
can one perfect the Elixir.
The Dao of the Elixir is wondrous yet unfathomable in this way.

The ancient Master Maopu (鸠摩罗什) often sighed,
*"If only the fragrance of the scriptures could be written with ink to make the Great Vehicle,
the Abhidharma would not be inferior to the teachings of Kāśyapa!"*
Now that those who deeply understand are few,
what remains to be expounded?

The ancients did not wish to reveal it,
lest the ghosts and gods be startled—
this is the same principle.
In the **Eighty-Eighth Chapter**, *"The Zen Reaches Jade Fluid and the Law Assembly"*
*"The Monkey-Spirit and Wooden Demons Instruct the Disciples,"*
Master Wùyī (悟一子) said:
*"This reveals the Great Dao—
it must be transmitted by a teacher.
To hoard the Dao is to obstruct the heavenly Way;
to reveal it lightly is to profane the heavenly treasure—
one must truly understand this."*

**"Jade Fluid"** refers to the Elixir of returning Jade Nectar.
At this stage, the nature-body is perfected;
to withhold transmission, leaving none to follow,
is the selfishness of obstructing the path.
If transmitted to the unworthy,
and the secrets are carelessly divulged,
disaster shall surely befall the one who does so.
The chapter’s teachings are most awakening and urgent.

When the Three Treasures (三藏) reached Jade Fluid,
he instructed his disciples:
*"Be cautious—
do not be reckless!"*
This clearly shows the meaning of not revealing lightly.

**"Eight Precepts bowed his head,
Sand Monk covered his face,
Pilgrim supported the Master."**
Even so, they still could not help but exclaim in unison:
*"We have only seen high monks who subdue dragons and tame tigers—
never one who subdues pigs and tames monkeys!"*

For the world knows only of dragons and tigers
as the effects of cultivation,
yet never understands what dragons and tigers truly are,
nor the merit of subduing them.
They do not know that pigs and monkeys
are but other names for dragons and tigers—
and when suddenly revealed,
how could they not be startled in doubt?

The **Monkey** (申猿) is the Elixir of Metal-Water,
the **Pig** (亥猪) is the Elixir of Wood-Fire,
and the **Sand** (沙) and **Precepts** (戒) represent the central Earth—
this is the principle of the Five Phases converging.
Readers unaware of its subtlety
mistake it for the restless monkey-spirits of the heart,
and dismiss the Sand and Precepts families as insignificant—
their understanding is no different from those who have never seen a monk subduing pigs and taming monkeys.

The world flees at sight,
stumbling and crawling,
ever fearful of avoiding it too little—
yet who knows that through fourteen cycles of cold and heat,
countless evils and demons,
they have endured untold suffering
before attaining the precious formula?

This treasure is not easily won—
worthy of being learned by kings and nobles—
yet if its brilliance is too shallow,
and one boasts of selling it,
one shall be deemed frivolous.
The scriptures say:
*"Clad in coarse robes yet holding jade within."*
*"If empty, if foolish."*
The Ancestors taught with great care—
not from selfishness or vanity.
For a lone string plays no harmony,
startling the crowd and shocking the wise;
few are the connoisseurs who respond,
and fewer still are those who benefit—
most only lose themselves.
How could one not be cautious?

Within the chapter, **"暴纱亭"** is revealed—
a sign of shallow, boastful display.
**"标窃神兵"** warns of the danger of flaunting and deceiving others.
**"暴"** means to proclaim;
**"纱"** means light and frivolous;
**"亭"** means a temporary stop.
If one carelessly reveals the secrets,
the curious shall seize the opportunity,
pretending to follow while exploiting the openings.

See how the Prince and the palace officials
were alarmed by the monk’s grotesque appearance,
begging him to go to **暴纱亭** to eat alms.
This is but a monk of outward form—
one who does not recognize his inner treasure’s worth,
and thus is not sincerely invited to dwell as a revered teacher,
but rather treated as a transient guest at an inn.

When the Prince boasted of his own prowess,
and the Three Disciples excelled in their arts,
the rooster’s cackle grew ashamed of its small cage,
the frog in the well felt the limits of its vision.
*"The father and son prostrated themselves in worship,
while Pilgrim coldly observed from the side."*
This was the assembly where the Law could be applied—
why not then enact a grand salvation
right at **暴纱亭**?

For there are teachings that must be kept secret,
and those that may be revealed without concealment.
Zen is the **Sramana’s** (沙门) method—
the **Sramana’s** (沙) teachings can be openly shared,
yet to guide beings toward liberation,
for those who chase after fame and profit,
or are weary from the labors of the world,
it must serve as a resting place and refuge.

The **elixir of jade nectar and return-to-origin** is the marvelous Dao/Way of awakening the mind and seeing true nature.

The **jade brilliance** of its splendor outshines the **fuxia** (甫华) and **gong** (衮) robes,
the **jade hue** of its luster surpasses the **qiang** (嫱) and **shi** (施) beauties;
the **jade essence** of its enduring nature is sturdier than the tripod or bell.

All possess it, each household holds it—
thus, no need for eager exhortation to entice,
nor for frantic efforts to rescue.

Those who return are not hindered by waiting for an invitation,
and seekers are not delayed by anger before guidance begins;
children are not burdened by my brevity,
and the reckless are not burdened by my indulgence.

It can be the **unsummoned** true friend of all beings,
and the **owner** of the Four Dependencies and Ten Stages.

Unlike the **golden elixir of return-to-origin**, passed down only once in ten thousand aeons,
which must be kept secret and never revealed.

These three monks, within the **violent-silk pavilion’s** quiet chamber,
on the same day accepted disciples,
received the **divine transmission** of the **Sramana’s** (沙门) teachings,
and **circulated the cosmos** through their **mystic energy**—
this is called the **open transmission** of the **Sramana’s** (沙) Law,
no more than external tools like weapons and martial prowess.
Their **subduing-pig, taming-monkey** (降猪伏猴) hidden marvels
were never uttered aloud or exposed in plain sight.

The **eight precepts’** stake and mallet weigh **5,048 jin** (斤) in total,
a single **treasure’s** measure.
The **Sramana’s** (沙) staff also weighs **5,048 jin**,
also a single **treasure**—
no difference in principle.

The **lonely wanderer’s** (独行者) rod weighs **13,500 jin**,
for it has already encompassed the **three treasures’** total,
yet it lacks the **three-five** (三五) harmonious perfection.

This tool can be replicated in form,
but must never be abandoned day or night—
in the **Buddhist** tradition, it is called the **"subduing-demon staff"** (降魔杵),
in the **Daoist** tradition, the **"wise sword"** (慧剑),
and in the **Confucian** tradition, the **"righteous cleaver"** (刚断).
It is an innate **intelligence**, a **treasure** for safeguarding truth and banishing evil—
never to be parted from for an instant.
Thus, **"a million rays of crimson light pierce the heavens,
a thousand streams of auspicious qi illuminate the earth."**

If one does not **return the spirit** and **abandon the body**,
but instead **departs for a moment**,
one will fall prey to **external demons**.

Hence, **"when left in the straw shed for three days,"
it was swept away by the **devouring jaws of the tiger and leopard** (豹头虎口).

The Prince, having received his teacher’s transmission,
his **original spirit** (元神) returned to its source,
his **shedding of the old self and rebirth** (脱胎换骨) complete—
like the dead revived—
now wields the **divine weapon**.

Thus, it is evident that the **Zen school’s** teachings,
once reaching the **jade brilliance** stage,
are sufficient to **enlighten ordinary beings**,
and **broadly manifest compassion**.

Those who have not yet glimpsed its **gate**,
yet **borrow the guise of a head monk** (头陀),
and **spread long-winded doctrines** (长舌),
are indeed the **later tiger and leopard jaws** (豹头虎口).

The **eighty-ninth installment**:
*"The Yellow Lion Spirit falsely convenes the stake and mallet assembly,
the gold, wood, and earth demons stir up chaos at Tiger’s Mouth Mountain."*
**Wùyī Zǐ** (悟一子) said:
This describes the **yellow-crowned** (黄冠) sect,
who **usurp the Daoist name**,
and bring upon themselves **misfortune from presuming without a teacher**.

Before the **jade brilliance** (玉华) assembly was held,
it was **ancestral transmission**—
true knowledge and genuine power—
hence called the **"authentic Law assembly"** (施法会).
This **stake and mallet** (钉钯) assembly,
however, is **false and teacherless**—
self-asserted, arbitrary—
thus called the **"empty assembly"** (虚设会).

The phrase **"Tiger’s Mouth Mountain, Leopard’s Head Cave"** (豹头山虎口洞)
clearly reveals those who **devour and indulge** in such teachings,
pretending to be **divine immortals**,
yet unaware of their own **wicked nature**.

Their **headgear** is the **Daoist cap** (道冠),
yet in truth, it is the **leopard’s head** (豹头);
their **utterances** are **Daoist speech** (道言),
yet in truth, it is the **tiger’s jaws** (虎口).

To generalize:
**Long sashes and short staffs** (长绦短麈) mimic the **master’s trimmed tail** (师剪尾) arrogance;
**Patched robes and straw sandals** (衲服芒鞋) imitate the **spotted and tattered** appearance.
They **entrap the fox** (绥狐) with **sharp claws** (利爪),
storing **nightly seduction** (夜夜之娇) in their **gourd** (葫芦);
they **seize the green serpent** (青蛇) with **bared fangs** (张牙吻),
concealing **clinking daggers** (铮铮之匕) in their **pouch**.
They **follow the traces of Master Zhang** (杖远公),
yet **do not hear the Three Mysteries** (三藐不闻);
they **wear the coarse robes of Master Damo** (着达摩之农),
yet **have not yet understood the One** (一归未解);
they **recite the sutras of Master Bolu** (诵波罗之经),
yet **deceit proliferates** (诡谲丛生).

Their **cushion** (蒲团) serves as the **den of a cunning hare** (狡兔之窟),
their **alms bowl** (钵盂) seeks the **land of drunken ease** (酣蘖之乡).
They **linger in the Jeta Grove by day** (祗园),
and **haunt the Flower Market at night** (花市),
**bodily a monk** (身比丘),
yet **in heart, a thief like Jié** (心盗跖).
How different can this be?

In the chapter, the Prince remarked:
*"People say there are immortals in the cave."*
Pilgrim replied:
*"It must be this region’s wicked fiend."*
A single word **pierced the deceitful’s vitals** (湛奸人肺腑),
proving that those who **deceive the world**,
can be **exposed by the vulgar**,
yet cannot **fool the wise**.

*"Seeing two wolf-headed demons,
they spoke clearly: ‘Our great king has been fortunate these days—
last month, he obtained a beautiful woman,
who lingers in the cave, bringing him great joy;
last night, he also acquired three kinds of weapons,
truly priceless treasures;
tomorrow, he will host a feast
to celebrate the **stake and mallet assembly** (钉钯会)!’"*

The mind’s pure contemplation, where *samādhi* and *prajñā* are inseparable,
is the Buddha’s void and luminous form—
the *dharma*’s subtle radiance.
The void of the Buddha is also the void of the *dharma*,
the void of the *saṅgha*—the mind itself abides.
Abiding in the three voids’ treasure,
this is also called the **Three Refuges**.

Thus it is said: the **Three Jewels**—Buddha, *Dharma*, *Saṅgha*—
are verified by the mind itself,
not borrowed from without.
How could they be seized and obtained?

The Yellow Lion stole the Three Jewels in secret,
rejoicing in his private heart.
Yet he rejoiced only in the **stake and mallet**,
not in the golden cudgel or jewel-staff—
not only did he fail to grasp the Three Jewels’ subtlety,
he did not even recognize what the **stake and mallet** were!
Perhaps he saw the mallet’s teeth resemble claws,
thinking them useful for sharpening his ferocity—
worthy of celebration, indeed!

To call it the **"Stake and Mallet Assembly"**
was but to gather his claws and fangs,
a hollow display of might.

To take pleasure in a beautiful woman
is to wield an axe against one’s nature;
to feast over the stake and mallet
is to plant the roots of self-destruction.
Given to lust and drunkenness,
forming factions and boasting of fame—
neither monk nor Daoist,
he flaunts grand deeds.
Even the **Maitreya** and **Laozi** would surely
manifest as **Vaiśravaṇa** in wrath,
wielding a flying demon-slaying blade,
to annihilate him instantly.

*"Only two small demons went east to buy swine and sheep."*
The **Qian** hexagram is where all yang originates,
yet to send small demons to buy swine and sheep—
how absurd their mistake!
This stems from their arrogance by nature,
seeking no true teacher,
only skilled in plunder and deceit.
They presume their cleverness surpasses all,
their wisdom piercing the four directions—
yet they reveal only cunning and eccentricity,
eccentricity and cunning.

Eight Rules transformed into cunning and eccentricity,
Pilgrim into eccentricity and cunning,
Sandy the Monk disguised as a swine-and-sheep merchant—
though called a scheme,
it is truly **speaking the Dao**.

**"Calculation"** (*jì*)—
the union of **"speech"** (*yán*) and **"ten"** (*shí*).
The principle of east three, south two,
north one, west four, and the center’s ten.

Pilgrim, as **Metal-Water**,
holds yang within yin—
thus his transformation into **eccentricity and cunning**,
where cunning lurks within eccentricity.
Eight Rules, as **Wood-Fire**,
holds yin within yang—
thus his shift into **cunning and eccentricity**,
where eccentricity hides in cunning.
Sandy the Monk, as **Central Earth**,
borrows from the four directions and thrives—
a guest of all yang,
in accordance with the **Luo River Diagram’s** logic.

They feigned pretense; we acted with true calculation.
To strike falsehood with truth—
how could it fail to be exposed?

When traced to his origin,
he was the **Golden-Haired Lion**,
a disciple of the **Nine Spirits’ Patriarch**.
Ah!
Having shattered their hollow guesses,
they now awaken to wisdom.

The two cunning ones
have already settled into their dual forms—
both body and mind.

A single invitation—
plainly a confession of guilt.

The Nine Spirits’ Patriarch wasted his divine thought,
yet it was the Three Monks’ staff-shouts that broke the spell.
Four-Ming’s blade could not sever the root of delusion—
how then escape the endless wheel of rebirth?

Gold, Wood, Earth—
the Five Radiant Yang Deities—
their Dao/Way,
yet they speak of *"playing with empty tricks to deceive my treasure"*?

The Golden-Haired Lion’s countless deceits,
his fake Fox-Dharma tricks—
no escape from sweeping the cave and burning the nest,
no fleeing to beg his master’s rescue.

Bamboo-Node Mountain—
node by node, hollowly transparent—
yet only secretly piercing emptiness;
Nine-Twist Cave—
twist by twist, intricately deceptive—
yet merely winding and groping in circles.

Lion’s head, lion’s tail, tangled and wild—
not a thread of truth remains;
Lion Patriarch, lion descendant—
chaos and clamor—
all half-hearted schemes.

Ah!
Futile scheming—
what use is it?

The Nine Spirits may command all lions,
worthy of being called *Lion Patriarch*,
yet not *Patriarch Master*.

Though thoughts multiply,
what good are they?

The *Analects* say:
*"To ponder without benefit is not as good as learning."*
The *Sutra* declares:
*"Without a teacher’s guidance,
even deep contemplation leads to the void of heaven’s gods."*

Self-made delusions blind the innate wisdom—
pitiable, indeed!

Here, the Three Monks are clearly marked as Gold, Wood, Earth—
their "monkey-mind, horse-will" theory
originates from self-made delusions!

---
**Ninety-First Chapter: The Lion-Teacher’s Transmission—Same Root, Different Branches**
**The Thief of Dao/Way Entangles Zen, Calming the Nine Spirits**

A sage once said:
*"This passage’s Dao/Way is profound and unfathomable—
even the Immortal Sage’s brush cannot exhaust its meaning,
leaving no choice but to end here."*

As for those who scrutinize and analyze,
exhausting thought and insight,
yet grasp only its surface—
such cases need not be discussed.

Even Li Zhi of Zhuo-Wu, upon reading the closing lines,
*"Sudden escape from all thoughts, quieting the mind for true fruit,"*
knew the Nine Heads as Nine Thoughts,
dividing until thoughtlessness—
seemingly grasping the marrow,
yet still only the surface?

The outline states:
*"The Lion-Teacher’s transmission—same root, different branches;
The Thief of Dao/Way entangles Zen, calming the Nine Spirits."*

Those who truly awaken interpret the first half:
*"Lion"* is *"thought"*—
*"Lion-Teacher"* is *"self-made delusion."*
*"Transmission"* is *"passing on"*—
*"transmission and reception"* is *"passing and receiving."*

Self-made delusion in enlightenment,
and receiving the Dao/Way through transmission—
though differing in effort,
they ultimately converge.

Interpreting the latter half:
*"Thief of Dao/Way,"*
*"entangling Zen,"*
*"calming the Nine Spirits"*—
terms for gradual and sudden methods,
further illustrating their convergence—
already surpassing Li’s understanding,
yet still only the surface?

Even the insightful say:
*"Lion-Teacher"* is merely *"self-made delusion"*—
the Dao/Way cannot be obtained through it;
*"transmission and reception"* is *"teaching"*—
the Dao/Way cannot be gained without enlightenment.

The error of self-made delusion
and the flaw in mere teaching
are the same.

The latter half:
The Dao/Way cannot be stolen,
Zen cannot be entangled,
nor can the Nine Spirits be stilled.

To seek enlightenment without awakening
is *"stealing the Dao/Way"*;
to grasp the Dao/Way through self-made delusion
is *"entangling Zen."*

The failure of *"Lion-Teacher’s transmission"*
is like *"stealing the Dao/Way, entangling Zen,"*
yet still hoping to calm the Nine Spirits into unity—
how could this succeed?

This has advanced beyond the surface,
yet still fails to reach the marrow.

The true path is:
*"Lion-Teacher"* is merely *"self-made delusion"*—
lions cannot be imitated;
only through a true teacher’s transmission
can one’s thoughts align in unity.

Why cannot thoughts be imitated?
Only through a true teacher’s transmission
can thoughts avoid error and converge.

Yet what law is transmitted?
What meaning is received?
This remains unsolved—
words cannot exhaust it.

In the past, the Tathagata Shakyamuni
dwelled in the world for eighty years,
teaching countless heavenly and human beings,
voice-hearers, and bodhisattvas.

He expounded the Five Precepts, Eight Precepts,
major and minor Vinaya,
the Four Noble Truths,
Twelve Links of Dependent Origination,
perfection of wisdom,
four immeasurables,
three knowledges and six powers,
thirty-seven factors of enlightenment,
the ten directions,
four fearlessnesses,
eighteen unique laws,
conventional truth,
ultimate truth,
countless liberations,
samadhi and dhāraṇī gates,
bodhisattva nirvana,
eternal dharma-nature,
ornamenting Buddha-lands,
saving sentient beings,
guiding bodhisattvas,
all wondrous methods—
truly vast and exhaustive,
encompassing the dharma-realm without bounds,
penetrating the nature-ocean without limit,
gradual and sudden methods left nothing omitted.

Yet in the end, he privately transmitted the *True Dharma-Eye* to Mahākāśyapa,
ordering ancestral succession,
a separate path in the world—
the *"special transmission outside scriptures,"*
beyond what the world could see or hear.

This was not to favor Kāśyapa over voice-hearers and bodhisattvas,
but because this law is the root of all sentient beings,
what all Buddhas realize,
transcending all reason,
free from all phenomena,
incapable of being grasped by speech, intellect, or analysis—
hidden from all speculation, visible or subtle.
Only heart-to-heart transmission,
seal-to-seal resonance,
can one self-attest to its luminous fruition.

Ancestor to ancestor, secretly revealing profound truths—
originally not something to be imitated through self-made delusion,
seized by force, or stolen.

Yet the Dao/Way is inherently within nature—
it cannot be stolen,
though the mystery of *"stealing the Dao/Way"*
lies precisely in the *True Dharma-Eye’s* singular transmission,
beyond thought or imitation.

The *Yin-Shu Jing* says:
*"Its thieving mechanism—
no one in the world can see,
no one can know."*

Master Lu said:
*"To pilfer the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,
to steal the vital qi of the Middle Void."*

Thus, the Dao is indeed obtained through this very act of theft.

The true teacher’s transmission
transmits not only the Dao
but also the Dao of *stealing the Dao*.
This *stealing of the Dao* is no ordinary Dao.
Hence it is said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao."*
It cannot be named or symbolized,
cannot be conveyed through words.

Yet if the Dao can be stolen,
then can Zen not also be entangled?

Having already *"stolen the Dao,"*
why then speak of *"entangling Zen"*?

Zen is true emptiness—
if one is entangled within it,
it is like two cords twisted together,
impossible to unbind.
What purpose does *"entangling Zen"* serve?

The subtlety of *"stealing the Dao"*
lies precisely in the profound constraint of the Dharma-limit,
the essence of still contemplation and unity.

For solitary contemplation alone cannot *"steal the Dao,"*
nor can exclusive Zen practice achieve still contemplation.

The art of *"stealing the Dao"*
resides in the authenticity of *transmission and reception*,
not in the delusion of *"teacher-lion"* posturing.

The art of *"entangling Zen"*
lies in what follows *"stealing the Dao,"*
not in mere still contemplation.

If one takes still contemplation as Zen,
they disturb Zen with stillness,
falling into void and emptiness—
not true Zen.

If one uses Zen to probe the Dao,
they chase the Dao with thought,
lacking the true seed within—
a false Dao.

The Nine Spirits have no way to stillness,
and the *"teacher-lion"* is but empty fabrication,
not the true transmission of the master.

Thus, *"stealing the Dao"*
is the foundation for stilling the Nine Spirits,
while *"entangling Zen"*
is the culmination of *"stealing the Dao"*—
beyond what pen and ink can fully explain.

This is the Dharma of the True Dharma-Eye,
fixed and unheard by most.

Its essence lies in first knowing
the Nine Spirits as one’s own self,
the six desires harming the body as the six lions encircling front and back,
with the green-faced trickster leading them,
and the nine-headed one as their commander,
arrayed in the *Kan* palace—
then the primordial yang sinks and cannot rise again.

What relies on the three monks’ true Five Phases
clashing fiercely is but a draw of equal strength.
Only the灵心’s transformation,
with intent following the heart’s turn,
can avoid being bound.

Yet the Nine Spirits’ roots come from Heaven—
once thought and desire stir,
the entire host is ensnared.
What is precious is preserving the heart to restrain desire,
calming the spirit,
boldly penetrating the tiger’s den,
until the Nine Spirits’ bamboo-jointed mountain’s nine winding caves—
only then does one grasp its depths.

The six senses are hard to sever,
most reluctant to abandon,
so the old demon weeps unseen—
one must forcefully subdue the mind-monkey,
from the start, like a great hammer striking
after a deep sleep in the brocade-cloud nest,
until the true heart suddenly breaks through.

Once the true heart emerges,
it naturally extinguishes the three corpses,
freely attaining liberation.

If one is agitated and startles themselves,
and the desire-root secretly flares,
then they can still be controlled by it—
for they lack the sovereign to command it.

Only with utmost sincerity and discernment
can one uncover its true master
and thus subdue it.

*"The Eastern Extreme’s Wondrous Rock Palace"*
is the realm of true nature.
*"Where the Lord of the Great Unity resides"*
is the Heavenly model to emulate.

The six lions cannot lurk within,
the nine lions cannot disturb.

The Lord of Heaven summons the **Qi-lion Disciple**—
his crime revealed: stealing the **Supreme Daoist’s** *Wheel of Rebirth* elixir,
three days lost in slumber, and thus straying from the **Nine Spirits’** source.
Now he glimpses the subtlety of *"Dao-Theft"*—
yet, before attaining stillness of thought.

The Lord of Heaven arrives at **Bamboo-Knot Mountain**,
declaring: *"The **Primordial Sage** is a spirit long refined by Dao,
penetrating the Three Realms above,
descending to the Nine Abysses below."*
Thought, when perfected, becomes a Sage—
translucent and boundless, past and future known,
radiant and luminous, and thus is true.

To fail in recognizing the **One True** as sovereign,
is to wander in false conjecture,
disturbed by chaotic delusions—
though luminous, it remains obscured.

Only when the **owner** is truly acknowledged,
ceasing all restless agitation,
and returning to **primordial forgetfulness**—
then the marvel of *"Ensnaring Zen"* is realized,
and the **Nine Spirits** are stilled.

For the **Master-Lion** cannot still the **Qi-Lion**,
but *"transmission"* may yet reveal *"Dao-Theft"*;
*"Dao-Theft"* cannot be without *"Ensnaring Zen"*,
but *"Ensnaring Zen"* can still the **Qi-Lion** and lead to unity.

*The **Awakening to Truth*** says:
*"At first, there is action—no one perceives,"*
that is *"Dao-Theft"*;
and again:
*"When true non-action dawns, all begin to know,"*
that is *"Ensnaring Zen"*.

Theft means **stealing**, ensnaring means **reveling**—
*"Dao-Theft and Ensnaring Zen"*
and the **Nine Spirits** merge as One!

Let the Daoist student not be deceived
by **false teachers** who **steal** their **alchemical tools**,
nor burdened by the **Six Desires** that disrupt the Way—
then they may yet succeed!

The **Immortal Master** uniquely employs the **Violent Silk Pavilion**
to subtly demonstrate his meaning—
thus the lines: *"Again to the Violent Silk Pavilion"*,
*"—one transmission of instruction."*

At the start: *"The **Blue-Faced Fiend** clings close to the **Nine-Headed Lion**,"*
showing the **illusion of chaotic conjecture**,
proclaiming: *"The mind must be transmitted, never forced to guess!"*
The **Blue Beast** is the **conjecture** itself.

The **True Person** declares:
*"Though your wisdom surpasses **Yan** and **Min**,
without the True Master, do not force your guesses!"*
Thus, the practitioner strikes down **doubt** with one blow—
and **false subtleties** and **perverse insights** become mere **meat-pies***.

**Yuhua** and **Jinping** are outer domains of **India**—
**Yuhua** is the **elixir of jade**, where **Zen** reaches its peak,
and **transmission of law** and **instruction to disciples** are both **royal****.

*"The **seventy-two kinds of solutions**"*—
the meaning of **seventy-two critical moments**.

The **transmitted tools**:
*"A **staff of one thousand jin**,
**pestle and rod each of eight hundred jin**"*—
this is the **primordial qi of the First Heaven**,
the **Eight-Eights of the Azure Dragon’s** essence.

Here lies the **"Tiger-Maw Cavern"**, mirroring below
the **"Azure Dragon Mountain of Jinping Prefecture"**—
parallel imagery.

**"Jinping Prefecture"** is the **elixir of gold**,
directly opposed to **"Yuhua"**—
on the **fifteenth day of the first month**, when the moon is full,
the **qi of gold** is perfectly balanced.

With the **"Azure Dragon Mountain"** mirrored to this tale’s **"Tiger-Maw Cavern"**, again parallel.

**Chapter 91: Jinping Prefecture’s Midwinter Lantern Festival**
**Xuan Ying Cavern’s Tang Monk’s Deposition**

The **Awakened-to-One** says:
These next two chapters—**"Jinping Prefecture"**—
stand in direct contrast to the previous three—**"Yuhua Prefecture"**—
**"Yuhua"** represents the **inner Five Phases’** *law-symbols*,
**"Jinping"** the **outer Five Phases’** *law-symbols*.

This uniquely clarifies the **fire-moments** of external alchemy—
they must not be missed!
Thus the **lantern festival** is used as an analogy.

**Zi Yang True Person** says:
*"Lead meets **Geng**—quickly harvest the **mustache**,
Gold meets the **waning**—do not dare to taste!"*
And again:
*"Before the **first half of the month** and after the **second half**,
The **first half** of the **first half**—
When the **drug’s flavor** is balanced, the **qi-symbol** is complete."*

*"Lead meets **Geng**"*—the hour is **zi**.
*"Gold meets the **waning**"*—the moon is **waning**.

The **first half** belongs to **yang**, the **second half** to **yin**—
within **yin**, **yang** is balanced,
yielding **eight liang of gold** from water’s depths,
its flavor **balanced**, its **qi-symbol** **complete**.

From the **third day** to the **fifteenth**, the **Three Yangs** are full—
the *law-symbol* is **《Kǎn》**—
at this time, the **yin-essence water** is exhausted,
the **yang-essence gold** swells in its cycle,
thus the **full moon**, pure **yang** without **yin**,
hence the term **"waning moon"** is reversed.

Speaking of: **urgently** seizing the moment to work,
never delaying a **jǐ** or **kè**—
lest the **Heavenly Opportunity** be lost!

*"The fifteenth day of the first month, Upper Element’s Festival—
the **Golden Lantern Bridge** with three **golden lanterns**,"*
when the **gold within water** is fully balanced—
one must **see clearly** and **act swiftly**.

*"Not before the third watch,
or the wind will come,"*
meaning the **yin-qi** has already surged,
the **fire-moment** has passed—
now it is **untastable**.

*"Four people herding three sheep,
descending from the **Western Slope**,"*
proclaiming the meaning of **"Three Yangs’ Prosperity"**—
the **West** is the **White Tiger’s** direction,
where **yang** is born—
when the time arrives, it comes,
urgently demanding harvest.

*"Only because the **Master** relaxed his **Zen-nature**,
resting at **Ci Yun Temple** to enjoy pleasure,
did the **prosperity peak** fail to arrive,
and **joy’s extreme** give way to **sorrow**."*
Revealing: beyond this **moment**, **yang** gradually yields to **yin**,
and the **fire-moment** is **slightly missed**.

The **four** represent **year, month, day, and hour**—
the **eyes of the fire-moment**—
without the **fire-eyes of golden clarity**, who can recognize?

*"**Ming Tian County**"*—
the **meaning of weeping and wailing**.

*"Fragrant oil fills the nostrils,
its worth is **precious and rare**,
yet it is only lit for **three nights**"*—
when the moon rises in **yín**, it is **most precious and rare**,
like **people’s vital essence**—difficult to accumulate,
easy to exhaust—
not to be **wasted** in ordinary pursuits.

If one fails to grasp its **rare and fleeting** signs,
and mistakes a **false Buddha** for **true nature**—
great **pity** indeed!

See how they fail to recognize the **Western Slope’s** joy,
yet say: *"Here, the virtuous folk,
reading scriptures and chanting **Buddha**,
all hope to cultivate and be reborn in **China**."*

*"It is further said, ‘Westward to the Soul Mountain, we have not yet gone.’*
This speaks of direction as if it were mere place—west or east—
yet fails to grasp that west and east transcend mere locality.
It is as if one mistook the path’s beginning,
and thus strayed from the true way.

Like Tang Seng, who failed to discern the false,
and bowed before a Buddha—
his error was his own alone,
no blame upon others—
just as his own confession attests.

The opening line—
*‘Departing from Jade Flower City’*—
reveals its bordering with Golden Plateau.

Observe how idle wanderers,
entering Ci Yun Temple to rest their horses,
call the abbot one who ‘leisurely nurtures ease,’
and invite Tang Seng to ‘stay at leisure, to play awhile’—
all describing the blind, careless squandering of time,
hence their startled cry:
*‘We’ve wasted the very light of days!’*

The text subtly embeds the lesson of *viewing lanterns on Yuan Night*
to signify discerning the *fire-moment’s* urgency—
a meaning made plain.

As for *Averting Cold, Averting Heat, Averting Dust*,
and the pretense of ‘oil offerings to the Buddha,’
it lays bare a band of dissolute loafers,
who steal idle days in sham devotion—
mistaking falsehood for truth,
while life’s swift hours slip away.

The Pilgrim raged:
*‘You thieving oil-mouthed demon!’*
—truth recorded as fact.

For *‘oil’* is *‘wandering’*—
as *‘sheep’* is *‘yang’*—
a cipher in this book’s hidden speech.

Yet *‘thieving oil’* reveals
the failure to grasp the fire-moment’s critical hour,
and to seize what is past its time.

Oil belongs to water—*yin*.
The three tusks are *yin*-earth, things of water—also *yin*.
To steal by moonlight, when the time has passed,
is to plunder *yin* with *yin*—
how could such ever be true?
Thus, a false Buddha.

For those who deeply know the fire-moment’s essence,
yet seize it out of season, are thieves of the Dao.
Those who fail to grasp its truth,
and misuse it against its time—
are thieves of oil.

The same act of theft,
yet one true, one false—
so vast the difference.

Sha Monk said, *“Lest we lose the chance.”*
Eight Rules said, *“Seize this moonlit hour to subdue demons.”*
Both speak to this same truth.

Let the reader’s eye follow to the next chapter—
where the Green Dragon Mountain looms,
and deeper meaning awaits.

**Chapter Ninety-Two**
*The Three Monks Battle Green Dragon Mountain*
*The Four Stars Seize the Rhinoceros Demon*

A Disciple of Awakening says:
This clearly marks the theft of *yin* by *yin* as the false Buddha—
one must swiftly discern and destroy it,
to root out deceit and restore truth.

Oil is pure *yin*-water, dregs unfit for use,
symbolizing the distant, useless *yin* within man.
The Three Rogues, under false names and sacred guise,
bewitch the ignorant, claiming the Buddha’s heart requires oil,
that oil may nourish the Buddha—
yet they waste only fat and feed delusion.

Like those who seek the elixir but confuse *yin* and *yang*,
and refine in error—
how far they stray!

The chapter begins with *“Green Dragon Mountain’s Mystic Cavern”*—
pointing to the black, murky *qi* of the earth.

Green Dragon is the east’s *yin* within *yang*—
bright without, dark within—
as when a man’s four great limbs are all *yin*,
yet he knows not what is *yang* essence.

One must borrow a spark of *yang* light,
turn it inward to illuminate,
and drive back the host of *yin*—
only then does one abandon falsehood for truth,
know time and grasp the moment.

Hasten with keen discernment and fierce resolve,
lest you mistake the path,
and waste the chance!

Thus, the text explicitly begins with the words *“Great Battle”* to awaken the mind.

The practitioner transforms the Fire-Flame Insect to illuminate the cave,
beholding the demons with their doors shut, fast asleep—
like an endless night,
is it not a block of sheer *yin*,
akin to the black, dark abyss of hell,
without distinction of day or night?

The Master Tang was in the dark, marveling at *“the different scene in the West”*,
saying, *“Now it is the first month,
lantern bugs stir from their dormancy—
why are there lantern bugs flying?”*

The commentator notes that though the Master Tang recognized the climate,
he did not realize that the Master Tang himself sat in ignorance of the climate.

For *yin* and *yang* have the principle of inversion,
and advance and retreat know no fixed moment.
The scripture says:
*“The Winter Solstice does not fall on the hour of Zi,
the morning and evening are but empty comparisons of Mao and You.”*

If one judges the flying of lantern bugs by the lunar calendar,
it is as if taking midnight for the hour of Zi,
and morning and evening for Mao and You—
a great error! A great error!
Hence, the practitioner urgently replies:
*“Master! Because of your failure to discern truth from falsehood,
you have wasted so much time and expended so much effort!”*

Alas! Such idle, cold words
are enough to make those who mistake *yin* essence and lag in seizing the moment
break out in a cold sweat.

The lantern’s glow appears only in darkness—
a *yang* within *yin*—
if one could always turn the light inward,
it would suffice to guide the lost.

The Master Tang’s astonishment at its untimely flight,
and the False Buddha’s door-shut slumber,
share the same confusion—
how could they not confess their crimes?

Locking them away in darkness,
yet eager to escape—
it is like covering one’s ears to steal a bell,
how could they hope to gain anything?

Sha Monk said:
*“Could it be that they are harming my master in secret?”*
The foolish one said:
*“Thieves stealing oil!”*

Everywhere, their true nature is revealed—
truly awakening the mind.
*“At this time, about the third watch,
the moon’s light in the sky is like daytime,”*
yet why were the Eight Rules and Sha Monk bound?

The moon is a *yang* within *yin*,
when *yin* qi moves with the moment,
abandoning darkness for brightness,
it gains the upper hand—
a subtle confirmation of the timing’s truth.

But the hour of Chou is the domain of earth,
wood can subdue earth,
so they should ascend to the East—
yet why did the practitioner ascend to the West?

Upon seeing the Great White Star of Metal,
he inquired into its origins,
revealing the strategy of tracing to the root—
in the True Gold, he discerned its falsehood.

In the earlier capture at Jade Flower State,
the lion should have ascended to the West to meet the Tathāgata—
yet why did it ascend to the East to meet the Lord of East Peak, the Marvelous Rock of the Supreme One?

In the True One, he settled the chaos.
The same principle applies:
the Jade Flower’s Tiger’s Maw Cave,
the Green Dragon Mountain of the Golden Plateau—
both display the marvel of inverted *yin* and *yang*,
and reciprocal illumination.

*“The half-rhino demon, barely formed,
can be subdued only by the four Wood-Beast stars.”*
The reader says that wood subdues earth
is the common principle of the Five Phases,
with no deeper meaning.

Yet here we see the true distinction between reality and illusion.

For the Dao of true immortals,
inverts the primordial *yang* of Heavenly Antiquity,
and through fire refining gold, the true gold emerges—
the marvel of seeing lanterns on the New Year’s Eve.

The False Buddha’s demonic essence,
follows the *yin* of the later Heaven,
and through wood subduing earth, the false earth collapses—
the error of lantern bugs flying at the third watch.

Thus, within the cave,
he rescued the Master Tang and his disciples,
gathering many pearls, jade, gold, and treasures—
wood aiding fire to purify the true gold,
as pearls and jewels enhance their luster.

Earth, injured by fire,
strips away the false earth clinging to the gold—
like the rhino’s retreat from its tracks.

Hence, the three rhinos fled for their lives,
daring not to enter the southern lands where fire thrives,
but instead plunging into the western seas where waters run deep—
they sought survival in the place where they were subdued,
yet did not know that in fleeing life,
they sought death.

Such is the folly of ignorance and misapplication—
contrary, perverse, and erroneous.

The scripture says:
*“Fire arises from wood,
disaster strikes when it is subdued.”*
Harvesting *yin* to cultivate wood,
the disaster of fire burning oneself—
the Four Wood-Beast stars align with Tianpeng,
thus their condemnation of the three rhinos is just,
truly knowing the clear principles of dharma and law—
how could they fail to punish according to the law?

It says:
*“Oafish rhino demons,
cloaked in hair and horn,
unaware of the meaning of ‘Three Yangs Open Tai,’
foolishly boasting of the three rhinos’ ability to flee.
Lazy and thieving,
they deceive the masses to amass wealth.
With the False Buddha’s face,
they devour living souls,
acting with cunning and deceit.
Riding the demonic wind,
they drain vital essence,
spreading their rampant chaos far and wide.
They grasp not the mechanism of growth and decay,
nor the wisdom of retreat and approach.
Burning their own nests,
they expose the law’s clarity—
beheading and dismembering,
they fulfill the people’s vengeance.”*

Hahaha!

The practitioner, having circled the **Golden Level Prefecture** ([金平府 *Jīnpíng Fǔ*]), issued a command midair—
the **True Law** ([真法 *Zhēnfǎ*]) thundered like rain, a spectacle all, wise or foolish, revered.

Master and disciple rose at the fifth watch,
stealthily crossing **Chen Cang** ([陈仓 *Chéncāng*]—lit. "Dark passage through Chen Cang"),
lest they be punished for their **reckless complacency** ([偷安错认 *tōu’ān cuòrèn*]) and stray from the path.

From now on,
they must **hasten their cultivation** ([修行 *xiūxíng*])—
no more delays!

**Chapter 93**
*At the **Giving Alone Garden** ([给孤园 *Gěigū Yuán*]), ancient tales are pondered, causes discussed,*
*The **Chao King** ([朝王 *Cháowáng*]) of **India** ([天竺 *Tiānjú*]) meets with chance.*

The **Awakened One** ([悟一子 *Wùyī Zǐ*]) said:
*"This passage, from beginning to end, repeats itself time and again.
After closing the scroll and deep reflection,
I still cannot grasp its meaning."*

**Suzi** ([苏子 *Sūzǐ*]) replied:
*"Reading books, one should not seek excessive understanding."*

Yet—
may one not understand it through not understanding?
If one insists on forcing an understanding, it would say:
*"Cultivators refine only the mind ([修道者修心 *xiūdào zhě xiūxīn*])—
the mind is inherently empty ([空洞无物 *kōngdòng wúwù*]), devoid of speech or script.
What need for words or letters?"*

The passage states:
*"‘No words or letters’ ([无言语文字 *wú yányǔ wénzì*]) is the true understanding ([真解 *zhēnjiě*]),*
*and this is the ‘**discussion of causes** ([谈因 *tán yīn*])’ ([因 *yīn*]).*

When **Tang Seng** ([唐僧 *Tángsēng*]) and **Xingzhe** ([行者 *Xíngzhě*]) say:
*"‘We understand it’ ([解得 *jiědé*])"*—
they mean this.

When they say:
*"‘At **Golden Level Monastery** ([布金禅寺 *Bùjīn Chántí*]), the **World-Honored One** ([世尊 *Shìzūn*]) was invited to deliver the **dharma** ([说法 *shuōfǎ*])’"*—
they speak of this.

When they say:
*"‘How many scholars are there in the world,
yet their bellies are hollow’ ([肚子里空空 *dùzǐ lǐ kōngkōng*])"*—
they refer to this emptiness ([空 *kōng*]).

When they say:
*"‘The old **Arhat** ([老和尚 *lǎo héshàng*]), **Tang Seng**, and **Xingzhe** in the **Giving Alone Garden** ([给孤园 *Gěigū Yuán*]) enjoy the moon,*
*listening to the **painful cries** ([痛苦之声 *tòngkǔ zhī shēng*]) and feeling their hearts ache’"*—
they mean this **emotional resonance** ([感触 *gǎnchù*]).

When they say:
*"‘In matters of sorrow and lament,
none but this **master** ([师家 *shījiā*]) can discern them clearly’ ([明辨 *míngbiàn*])"*—
they speak of this **discernment** ([明辨 *míngbiàn*]).

When they say:
*"‘**San Zang** ([三藏 *Sānzàng*]) and **Xingzhe** ([行者 *Xíngzhě*]), having heard this,
held it deeply in their hearts’ ([切切在心 *qièqiè zàixīn*])"*—
they mean this **deep reflection** ([切切 *qièqiè*]).

When they say:
*"‘Hoping to return to the country and widely apply the **dharma’s power** ([法力 *fǎlì*])’"*—
they speak of this **broad practice** ([广施 *guǎngshī*]).

The saying of **"discussion of causes"** ([谈因 *tán yīn*]),
is it so?
Or is it not?

If one were to force an interpretation and say:
*"Those who cultivate the Dao merely gather the primordial yang true-qi*—
then the true understanding is that body and mind must be harmonized, and yin-yang paired in union—
this is called **"encountering the pair"** ([遇偶 *yù'ǒu*]).*

When they say:
*"‘All rush off to watch the tossing of the embroidered ball’"*—
they mean this **gathering** ([采取 *cǎiqǔ*]).

When they say:
*"‘The Pilgrim does not forget the old monk’s words,
and together they go to the painted pavilion to discern truth from falsehood’"*—
they speak of this **discernment** ([辨明 *biànmíng*]).

When they say:
*"‘The false Princess, knowing that San Zang would arrive today at this very hour,
borrowed the moment to gather’"*—
they mean this **gathering** ([采取 *cǎiqǔ*]).

When they say:
*"‘From the pavilion, they cried in unison:
“A monk has been struck!”’"*—
they speak of this **striking** ([打着 *dǎzhe*]).

When they say:
*"‘The three of us will enter the court—
within ourselves, we shall know how to discern’"*—
they mean this **discrimination** ([辨别 *biànbié*]).

When they say:
*"‘The Pilgrim said:
“Fool, do not speak recklessly!
First pack our belongings—
then we shall proceed to court to offer protection”’"*—
they speak of this **protection** ([保护 *bǎohù*]).

The saying of **"encountering the pair"** ([遇偶 *yù'ǒu*]),
is it so?
Or is it not?

「If one insists on forcing a literal interpretation,
then let one listen to it as such—
yet in truth, the answer is a resounding *no*.
But to abandon this and seek another true interpretation,
one would leave the reader utterly perplexed.

This is the **limit of the True Dharma** ([正法限 *zhèngfǎ xiàn*]),
a **separate transmission outside the teachings** ([教外别传 *jiào wài bié chuán*]),
which cannot be expressed in words.

In the verse, *“The Dao is in the sacred transmission, its practice lies within oneself”* ([道在圣传修在已 *Dào zài shèngchuán xiū zài yǐ*]),
the seven characters have been **explained** ([解 *jiě*]),
yet it is said that the meaning can be **transmitted** ([传 *chuán*]),
but not **explicated** ([解 *jiě*]).

The **Pilgrim** ([唐僧 *Táng Sēng*]) received the *Heart Sutra* ([《心经》 *Xīn Jīng*]) from **Master Wu Chao** ([乌巢禅师 *Wū Cháo Chánshī*]).
When **Master Wu Chao** said, *“You are reciting it in a muddled way,”*
**the Pilgrim** ([行者 *Xíngzhě*]) replied:
*“Master, you only recited it—
you never sought to explain it to me.”*

Since **San Zang** ([三藏 *Sān Zàng*]) had never **explained** ([解 *jiě*]),
upon being prompted, he declared:
*“You damned monkey! How dare you say I never **explained** ([解 *jiě*]) it?
Do *you* understand it?”*
The **Pilgrim** ([行者 *Xíngzhě*]) answered:
*“I understand it.”*
From then on, he made no further sound.

Readers may take this as **Master Zhū** ([夫子 *Fūzǐ*]) calling upon **Pán** ([参 *Shēn*]),
but they do not realize that here,
the **Master** ([师 *shī*]) **transmits** ([授 *shòu*]) to the **disciple** ([徒 *tú*]),
while in the original,
the **disciple** ([徒 *tú*]) **transmits** ([授 *shòu*]) to the **Master** ([师 *shī*]).
This is the **reverse method of the Daoist path** ([仙道逆法 *Xiāndào nìfǎ*]),
with its own profound significance.

When **Eight Rules** ([八戒 *Bā Jiè*]) pressed him to **explicate** ([解 *jiě*]),
**Sha Monk** ([沙僧 *Shā Sēng*]) said:
*“Big brother is spouting nonsense,
tricking Master to move on.”*
Both were **unaware of the explanation** ([不知解者 *bù zhī jiě zhě*]).

Thus, **San Zang** ([三藏 *Sān Zàng*]) declared:
*“Sun Wukong’s **explication** ([解 *jiě*]) is beyond words and letters—
it is the **true explication** ([真解 *zhēnjiě*]).
What is this **true explication** ([真解 *zhēnjiě*])?”*

The ancient Master of Nanquan instructed the assembly, saying:
*"The heart is not the Buddha, wisdom is not the Dao."*

Chen Nihuan remarked:
*"There is another layer of strangeness beyond strangeness—
the heart and kidneys are not the *Kàn-Lí* [坎离] of yin and yang.
Spirit, soul, heart, mind, and qi—
when observed, they seem real yet are ultimately not."*

Master Lü said:
*"The Four Great Elements [四大] of the body are all yin—
where then does the yang essence reside?"*
And again:
*"Do not cling to this body as the Dao,
for solitary cultivation of a single thing is but solitary yin."*

When Master Tí Lǎng asked Stonehead [石头], *"What is the Buddha?"*
Stonehead replied: *"You have no Buddha-nature."*

Master Wúyè, of noble bearing, met Master Mazu, who said:
*"This grand Buddha Hall stands empty—
within it, no Buddha dwells."*

A monk asked Master Shànjué:
*"Does this dog still possess Buddha-nature?"*
*"I am not a sentient being,"* he replied.
*"If you are not a sentient being,"* the monk pressed, *"are you then the Buddha?"*
*"No,"* the master said.
*"Then what in truth are you?"*
*"Nor am I a thing."*
*"Can it be grasped or perceived?"*
*"Thought cannot reach it, analogy cannot grasp it—
thus it is said to be beyond thought and comparison."*

Though the nature of the *Xìngtán* [杏坛] is without limits,
yet Master Zǐyú’s cultivation of qi is said to be difficult,
for he spoke of the sages of the Three Teachings
never taking the heart as the Dao,
but striving instead for the utmost in *géwù zhìzhī* [格物致知].

If one reads the *Heart Sutra* and claims *"mind is Buddha,"*
then one has failed to grasp the subtlety of *color-emptiness, emptiness-color*.
Its profundity cannot be conveyed through words or letters—
thus the Master *"never spoke again."*

Yet neither is it *"non-heart, non-Buddha,"*
for it cannot be awakened by the mind alone—
one must await transmission from the Master before understanding.

Hence, when Jìgū’s nobleman paved the garden with gold
to purchase the Jeta Grove,
only then could he invite the World-Honored One to teach—
how lightly such truths can be passed on!

How many scholars pore over these texts,
yet their minds remain hollow—
who among them truly knows?
Deeply lamentable!

If one takes these hollow, cold words
and claims they are but the idle verse of poets Jia Dao or Bai Juyi,
then one’s understanding is shallow indeed!

He speaks of *"Bǎijiǎo Mountain"*—
a hidden warning that pure yin’s domain is no place for action.
He mentions *"Jīmíng Pass"*—
one must await the return of yang’s first stir.

*"At this moment, the crescent moon shines bright,"*
revealing where the Dao/Way resides.
*"Suddenly, a Daoist arrives with news: ‘The Master has come.’"*

Led to the Jeta Grove where the World-Honored One taught,
walking beneath the moon’s glow, the heart still—
when a voice, tragic and sharp, pierces the silence.
*"Tragic"*—that is *"non-heart"*;
*"sharp"*—the soil of *"knife-and-pill"*,
not of the heart, yet truly piercing.

Ah, the wonder of it!
*"The matter of this tragic cry
is beyond even this Master’s clear discernment."*
Unless one meets a monk like Tang Seng,
no further words may be spoken.
*"It is beyond speech or letters—
only true understanding remains."*

*"Last year’s same day,"*
when the crescent moon shone bright—
*"at the very moment of clear nature’s illumination,
a gust of wind suddenly rose,
and a voice, tragic and sharp, broke through."*
Upon the Jeta platform stood
a maiden of exquisite beauty and grace.

Within this moonlit scene,
the World-Honored One’s teaching place
suddenly scattered heavenly flowers,
summoning celestial maidens—
not to be mistaken for demons or ill omens.

Here, the Buddha had already bestowed
the True Dharma Eye upon Xuánzàng.
Thus, when the Three Pilgrims heard,
they grasped its profundity—
to be held close in the heart.

*"Close"*—that is *"knife-and-pill"* soil.
As the Master and disciples prepared to depart,
the old monk again urged the tragic matter,
and the Pilgrim laughed in reply:
*"I understand! I understand!"*
The transmission now clear,
just as the flower was plucked and a smile exchanged.

Like the crowing of the golden rooster,
they awoke suddenly—
free to take the great road,
passing the pass unobstructed by Bǎijiǎo Mountain.

From there, they pressed straight to the Golden City’s celestial treasury,
together ascending the painted pavilion to watch the ball of embroidered silk.
*"Painted"*—the five hues, the radiant colors of the Five Phases;
*"ball"*—the Supreme Ultimate, the perfect union of yin and yang.

Tang Seng suddenly recalled:
*"My mother also cast the embroidered ball—
a fateful encounter that bound us in marriage."*
Ah, the wonder!
From the very source of birth,
one awakens to this thread of destiny—
the original face itself.

The opening poem declares:
*"Whether becoming immortal or Buddha,
one must arrange it from here."*
Alas! Who could fail to arrange it
from the very place of one’s parents’ birth?

The false princess sought the monk’s true *qi*
to become a celestial being;
the true monk could not be deceived by her,
lest he fall into hell.

The Pilgrim’s ability to discern truth from falsehood
is precisely his grasp of the *Heart Sutra*.

The Pilgrim devises the *"leaning on marriage to summon demons"* stratagem—
Tang Seng nods in silent understanding,
while the King of India and the false princess remain unaware.
Eight Rules and Sha Wujing exchange playful banter,
the stationmaster’s words are upside-down—
just as the *Lotus Sutra* warns:
*"If such matters are spoken of,
all heavens and all people
will be filled with astonishment and doubt."*

I have drawn out this lengthy tale,
yet have not truly fathomed a single character of the *Heart Sutra*—
no different from the Master’s *"never speaking again."*

On that day, Tang Seng walked beneath the moon in the Jeta Grove,
met an old monk,
and upon hearing the tragic cry, awakened.

Oh, reader—do not cling to the text in vain imaginings!
Could you not also meet the old monk,
stroll beneath the crescent moon’s light,
and listen for the tragic cry?

---
**Ninety-fourth Chapter**
*The Four Monks Feast in the Palace Garden*
*A Monster Harbors Lustful Desire*

**A Disciple’s Awakening:**
These next two chapters I did not wish to explain,
for fear that explanation would only deepen confusion.

The Buddha said:
*"If such matters are spoken of,
all heavens and all people
will be filled with astonishment and doubt."*
That mortals should be astonished is due to their narrow vision—
let that pass.
But why should even the heavens be astonished?
Then there must be matters truly astonishing and doubtful.

Thus, I refrain from explanation,
lest I add to the confusion of others.
Some may say this is but the fiction of *Meng Liang’s Plum Garden*,
or the allegory of *Zhi Yuan’s Ink Garden*—
yet they cannot fathom what is performed or what is concealed.

Truly, to mock the book’s clear references—
like taking the jade hare and teasing it with the south wind—
is a grave sin!

Let us take the book’s most evident passages and explain them,
so that astonishment and doubt may be set aside.

All have read *Journey to the West*—
should the *"factor"* in *"discussing the factor"* not be emphasized?
*"Factor"*—that which gives rise.

This chapter discusses the *factor* before one’s parents’ birth,
and the *factor* that follows birth.

All have read the *I Ching*—
should the *"encounter"* in *"encountering偶"* not be emphasized?
*"Encounter"*—the yin line.

This chapter reveals:
*Kàn* moving and falling into *Kūn*, forming *Kǎn*;
*Kūn* moving and falling into *Kàn*, forming *Lí*—
the paired configurations.

On that day, the World-Honored One, with compassion for all beings,
spoke of the *factor* in his teaching,
for those who would escape birth and death
must first know the *factor* of their birth,
and only then may they learn to die.

As when treating illness—
one must first know the root of the disease
before the proper remedy can be applied.

Thus, before entering the Jeta Grove, the *factor* was discussed,
and before entering the Palace Garden, the *factor* was questioned.
Only through the subtlety of questioning the *factor* in the Palace Garden
can one truly grasp the principle of discussing the *factor* in the Grove.

Hence, I pause here to speak of the *factor* before birth.

When Tang Seng reached the Golden Hall,
the king asked:
*"From where have you come, monk?"*

---

The king inquired: *"Where did the three of you originate? What are their surnames and given names? Why did they take ordination? Which scriptures do they seek?"*

Was this not asking about the *factor* of their coming?

The monk replied: *"Your Majesty asks of my coming *factor*—I shall now declare it."*

Was this not asking about the *factor* of their coming?

The Pilgrim responded: *"My father is Heaven, my mother Earth; once I paid homage to the Supreme Sage and mastered the Great Dao. It was only due to the chaos of the Peach Blossom Festival, where I rebelled against the Celestial Palace, that I was pressed beneath the Five-Phase Mountain."*

Was this not the *factor* of their coming?

Eight Rules spoke: *"All my life I was in confusion, until I met a true Sage. I diligently cultivated the twenty-four practices and reverently refined the sixty-six precepts. It was only because, drunk from the Peach Blossom Festival wine, I teased Chang'e, that I was banished to the mortal realm."*

Was this not the *factor* of their coming?

Sand Rules said: *"Fearful of rebirth, I encountered a celestial companion. I nurtured a child and completed the marriage of a maiden. It was at the Peach Blossom Festival gathering that I dropped a cup, shattering it, and was thus exiled to the Flowing Sands."*

Was this not the *factor* of their coming?

If one does not recognize the *factor* of their coming, then the biographies of the Three Disciples are fully recorded in the earlier chapters—this repetition seems redundant and meaningless. Yet it reveals the root of the Great Dao, which must be unveiled in the World-Honored One’s teaching at the Golden Hall and clarified in the Palace Garden’s display of the Dao.

Though the monk’s *factor* of coming has already been spoken of, the Pilgrim said: *"Fortunate is my Master, who departed from the Eastern Lands to pay homage in the Western Realm."*
Eight Rules said: *"I protect Tang Seng on his direct journey to the Western Heaven."*
Sand Rules said: *"I follow the Buddhist disciple of the Tang Dynasty to the Western Heaven."*

This seems to restate the *factor* of their coming anew, yet it also reveals their original unity as Master and disciples.

The Three Disciples all originated from the Peach Blossom Festival, showing that their brothers were born from the same *qi*.

Originally, they were of the *Qián* (乾) nature—only when one moved did it become *one* (一), and when one *odd* (奇) changed into *pair* (偶), the true yang was submerged, giving rise to *Kūn* (坤), which then formed *Kàn* (坎), while *Qián* (乾) formed *Lí* (離). In this moment of confusion, the matching of yin and yang was achieved, and this is the true principle of the *factor* of their coming—they encountered the *pair*.

If earlier, the True Princess fell into the Golden Hall, a pure *Qián* (乾) place that became the *Lí* (離) configuration;
then the Three Tripitaka Master and disciples all arrived in the Palace Garden, within the *Kūn* (坤) realm, forming the *Kàn* (坎) symbol—this is the differing *factor* of their coming, yet still an encounter with the *pair*.

The profound meaning of this chapter cannot be fully exhausted.

As the Pilgrim said: *"We ordained beings progress step by step."*
Now, *"discussing the factor"* and *"encountering the pair"* may indeed be called *"a step forward."*

Let me further advance a step for all—do not be startled or doubtful at what the World-Honored One has said.

The True Princess is the transformed body of Tang Seng’s Three Disciples;
Tang Seng’s Three Disciples are the divided forms of the True Princess.

Why so?

The True Princess is *yang* within and *yin* without—though appearing as a female form, she is truly male.
The Three Disciples are *yang* without and *yin* within—though appearing as male forms, they are truly female bodies.

The *Awakening to Reality Chapter* states:
*"The sun residing in the *Lí* (離) position yet becomes female,
the moon paired in the *Kàn* (坎) yet is truly male.
Those who do not grasp this inverted meaning
should not presume to speak loftily of worldly matters."*

This is the *factor* that can be endlessly discussed.

Let the assembly advance yet another step: The False Princess is but the borrowed form of Tang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess;
Tang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess are likewise the borrowed forms of the False Princess.

Why so?

A stir in the Heavenly Palace gives rise to wrath and desire,
a stir in the Moon Palace gives rise to wrath and desire—
all from one movement, all one monstrous essence.

Because of the Moon Hare’s monstrous theft into the Yin Palace,
it thus mingled into the Palace, thus overturned the Heavenly Palace,
thus made it impossible to settle the outcome.

Yet the False Princess was not wrought by Jade Hare—
it was all wrought by Tang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess.

Tang Seng’s present fall into the *Kūn* (坤) Palace
was not wrought by the False Princess—
it was all wrought by the Pilgrim’s rebellion against Heaven,
self-inflicted.

Tang Seng’s present marriage to the False Princess
was not wrought by the False Princess—
it was all wrought by Eight Rules’ drunken sport with Chang’e,
self-invited.

Tang Seng’s present striking of the embroidered ball
was not wrought by the False Princess—
it was all wrought by Sha Monk shattering the glass cup,
self-struck.

The True Princess’s entrapment at the Cloth-of-Gold Temple
was not wrought by the False Princess—
it was all wrought by Suo E’s single palm of worldly longing,
self-trapped.

The Five Phases coalesce into one *qi*,
the Three Monks coalesce into one Monk—
divide their forms, and four may arise;
a myriad truths are but one truth,
one monstrosity becomes a hundred monstrosities—
yet in essence, none but one.

Thus, the True Princess is again Tang Seng’s Three Disciples,
Tang Seng’s Three Disciples are again the True Princess.
Tang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess
are again the False Princess.

Today’s ball-throwing and marriage invitations
were not wrought by the False Princess—
they were all wrought by Suo E’s single palm.

This is the *factor* that cannot be endlessly discussed.

Advance yet further: For men to seek women is the norm of propriety.
Why does the False Princess, as a woman, seek men as if marrying a bride?
This inversion has its cause.

Let the assembly advance yet another step: All the thousand demons and hundred fiends across the hundred chapters
are but one monstrosity—
all wrought by the False Princess’s single monstrosity.

All the myriad trials and difficulties across the hundred chapters
are but one movement—
all wrought by the True Princess’s single palm.

The causes of true and false are indeed beyond clear distinction!

This comes from the "meeting of pairs" within the *factor*.

The assembly may wish to advance yet another step, yet fear touches upon matters that are startling and dubious—
thus, one cannot but halt here.

Within the chapter:
*"The traveler, pondering the elder’s words, proceeds to investigate true and false."*

He declares:
*"If she is a true woman, then you shall become a son-in-law."*
Again he says:
*"At the wedding ceremony, let us all cause a commotion and take her away."*
*"Master and disciple shall follow one another without a moment’s separation."*
All are but expressions of the intent to clarify cause and effect,
and to seek liberation through self-understanding.

The *"Hall of Pacifying Flowers"* must clarify the true nature of gold,
while the *"Pavilion of Retaining Spring"* must clarify the falsity of lingering.
Man lingers in Spring, ascending to Pacify Flowers—
one must discern the true through the false;
each partakes in feasting, compelled to rejoice—
again, the false responds to the false.

In spring, summer, autumn, and winter,
one should forget emotions by aligning with the scene—
within the false, there lies the true;
at joyous gatherings of auspicious times,
though one may lead and the other follow,
within the true, there lies the false.

Cupping wine and sleeping deeply—
true, yet not truly true;
playing and shouting—
false, yet not falsely false.

The twelve auspicious days hold genuine marvels,
yet the cluster of flowers is but hollow blossoms.

The *Zhao Yang Palace* performs grotesque music,
fearing that the true may shatter the false;
in the *Imperial Flower Garden*, counting on fingers—
fearing that the false may shatter the true.

To restrain the heart, to evade the body—
the true may become false;
to depart the *Soul Mountain*, to transform the form—
the false may become true.

Manifesting the true body, transforming into a bee,
the false union, the *Crow and Magpie Palace*—
false within false, true within true—
indescribable in rigid terms.

Yet its origins, though still discernible,
are such that only the *Buddhist monk of the Golden Pagoda*
can clarify the true and false causes and effects—
none but Tang Sanzang and his three disciples can do so.

Let one carefully ponder the next chapter,
where *"Meeting Pairs"* again reveals the marvel of origins.

---
**Ninety-fifth Chapter: False Form Captures the Jade Hare, True Yin Returns to Meet the Soul Element**

A disciple awoke and said:
*"The Golden Crow and Jade Hare are the essence of sun and moon;
the waning, new, full, and crescent phases are the union of yin and yang.
Heaven and man share no separate principles—
divine motion follows its own natural laws.
The moon borrows the sun’s light to illuminate,
yin relies on yang’s function to manifest its use.
Those who willingly enter the cycle of rebirth
let their minds follow *qi* in transformation,
thus true and false alternately divide and multiply;
those who escape death and life
preserve their nature while reversing *qi*,
thus true and false ultimately merge as one.

Urgent is the need to clarify and seize with resolve;
do not delay, lest they slip away.
This chapter precisely clarifies the origins of true and false—
it is the true exposition of the *Heart Sutra*.
It is the monk of the Golden Pagoda’s earnest, sorrowful admonition.

Clarity lies within clarity itself,
yet one cannot distinguish beyond it.
When moonlight is brightest, golden *qi* fills the wheel—
pointing to the moon and verifying its imprint,
the marvel of paired union becomes true.

The essential technique lies in seeing without seeing color,
remaining entirely free of thought.
Thus, at the chapter’s opening, the traveler sees his master
completely unmoved, and exclaims in awe:
*"What a monk!"*
The foundation of not moving the mind
must be seen through and the true and false discerned.

The traveler, seeing through it, cries:
*"Master, the princess is false!"*
The elder replies:
*"She is false—yet how shall we make her reveal her true form?"*
Ah! How wondrous!

Recognizing the true within the false—
this is the Buddha who came from the West.

For the false is the false princess;
yet what is the "false of the false"?
Within the false there remains the true—
only when the true form is revealed
does one attain clear discernment.

*"How shall we make her reveal her form?"*
Then there must be a method indeed.

The traveler says:
*"Summon the *dharma-body*, and seize her here."*
Thus it is clear the traveler too is a false form.

If she does not reveal her true nature,
then false is joined with false—
the true becomes indistinguishable.

Hence, *"Once the true form is revealed,
he steps forward and seizes her,
shouting: ‘You here fabricate falsehood as truth,
deceiving my master’s true *yang*!’*
The monk clutches the king, crying:
*"Your Majesty, fear not!
This is my wayward disciple using *fa-li* to discern true from false."*
He also consoles the queen:
*"Fear not!
Your princess is but a false form made to seem true."*

Throughout, the words *"true"* and *"false"* are the key.

*"The false princess shed her garments,
cast aside her ornaments,
and in haste discarded her falsehood—
her true essence now manifest,
she fought with the monk."*

Here lies the divine subtlety, utterly free of falsehood—
this is the true within the union of falseness.

When the battle raged long,
and they neared the Western Paradise,
it was revealed as a golden being of the West—
turning back to the gate of the Western Land,
suddenly *"with a wave of his body,
golden light radiated in ten thousand rays,
hurling straight toward the south."*

Reaching a great mountain,
he pressed upon the golden light,
plunged into the cave—
and vanished without trace.

Thus the West is his native land,
while the South is but his borrowed abode.

As the *Yijing* says:
*"In the southwest, companions appear—
one may walk with them in harmony."*

The traveler gathered his forces and returned.
At this point, the immortal master pointed to the profound Dao, saying:
*"This is the hour of *shen*."*

Why this sudden mention of *"shen"*?
*"Shen"* is metal—
*ren* water thrives in *shen*.
Is it time?
Is it *shen* itself?
Or *"shen hour"*?
The hidden meaning leaps forth.

Those with innate immortal essence,
reading this passage,
should reverently set up an incense altar,
bow a hundred times in devotion, and say:
*"Homage to the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful,
Savior of Suffering, Most Benevolent, Most Holy,
Most Wondrous Great Bodhisattva."*

The king asks:
*"If the false princess is a demon,
where then is my true princess?"*

The traveler replies:
*"Seize the false princess,
and the true one will naturally appear."*
The true lies within the false—
when the false is captured,
the true emerges effortlessly.
This is the authentic method of saving truth through falsehood.

At this juncture, vigilance is paramount.
*"Dividing inner and outer,
keeping the heart ever watchful."*
This passage speaks to the critical work of guarding against peril—
most urgent of all!

Only thus may one clearly discern true from false,
lest one waste effort in vain.

The traveler ascends to the southern peak, where the demon retreats into its lair, feigning cowardice and hiding. The mountain spirit declares:
*"This mountain, from ancient times to now, has never harbored a demon—it is a land of fivefold auspicious *yáng* energy. If the Great Sage seeks a demon, he should look toward the Western Heavenly Path."*

This reveals the limited wisdom of one unable to discern true from false. Little do they know that the five radiant *yáng* lands are precisely where the essence of *jīn* (metal) lies concealed. Then:

*"When the traveler reaches the southern peak’s cavern, two massive stones block the entrance. With an iron rod, he pries them apart—the demon, startled, leaps out with a ‘whoosh!’ Terrifying the mountain spirit and earth god into frantic retreat."*

This is what is meant by *"speaking the truth sends demons into panic."*

A true practitioner recognizes that where five-colored lotuses bloom atop a mountain, the earth’s rivers and mountains are but a single jewel hidden within. True and false intertwine—who can truly distinguish them?

Suddenly, the Star of Lesser Yin reveals how the Jade Rabbit stole the elixir, exposing the case of Chang’e’s descent to the mortal realm. With the truth laid bare, the demon’s original form is exposed—*"rolling about to reveal its true nature."*

Thus, the luminosity of Lesser Yin illuminates the true and false of Lesser Yin itself; beyond this illumination, there is no other light.

*"A radiant patch of clouds appears in the south, bright as day"*—this marks the moment when the Jade Rabbit returns to its true form. The traveler’s loud cry awakens the deluded. Eight Rules’ lustful impulse is a warning against carnal desire. The king inquires further, realizing the false princess was the true Jade Rabbit, while the true princess was the false one. By removing the false and seeking the true, the old monk’s urgent words at the Golden Temple become clear.

When the Jade Rabbit is returned to the Moon Palace, the true *yīn* returns to India. Retracing the illusions of moon-viewing and ball-playing, recounting the tragic separation of mother and child, and reforming the subjugation system of the Precious Flower Monastery—these lingering details all touch upon profound truths. Yet to truly discern true from false, one must awaken the heart.

Further clarification: The false princess is indeed false—false in her assumed form, yet before assuming it, she was true. Before capture, she was the false princess; once exposed, she became true. False yet truly real—who can distinguish this?

The true *yīn* is the true princess. Only after returning to purity is she truly true; before that, she cannot be called true. Only when she returns to purity can she reunite with the *língyuán*—can she be said to reunite with it before purity? Even this is false. True yet truly false—who can distinguish this?

Deeper still: The Jade Rabbit is a celestial beast; Chang’e is a celestial maiden. Within the Moon Palace, only the Jade Rabbit’s spirit is vital—all the immortals’ elixirs depend on its mortar and pestle. The Moon Palace can do without Chang’e, but not the Jade Rabbit. The Rabbit is the false consort of the king’s realm yet the true one of the Moon Palace; Chang’e is the true consort of the *Kūn* (receptive) realm yet the false one of the *Qián* (creative) realm. This too must be discerned.

Earlier, the traveler remarked:
*"A woman’s husband is her noble one—how could he not be seated?"*
The character *"seated"* (坐) combines two *"people"* (人) into *"earth"* (土). Earth contains *wù-jǐ* (the five earthly branches), and without this earth, a person cannot pair—*"seated"* is the subtle essence of *"deeply in mind."*

The Buddha said:
*"Within the *qián-kūn*, between heaven and earth, there is a treasure hidden in the form-mountain, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the *xiānguān* orifice."*
The term *"noble"* (貴) symbolizes *"a treasure within"* and is the essence of *"urgent matters."*

As for *"India"* (天竺) and *"Precious Flower"* (寶華), *"heaven"* (天) is *"two people"* (二人), *"India"* (竺) is *"two"* (二个)—within lies the birth of the Precious Treasure, the essence of *"encountering a match."*

The final four words—*"realized nature"* (了性) and *"true emptiness"* (真空)—are not to be confused with the annihilation of nature or empty stillness. These must be clearly distinguished.

**Ninety-sixth Chapter: Leak the Official Welcomes a High Monk, Tang the Elder Rejects Wealth and Nobility**

A disciple asked: In the following two chapters, the calamities of protecting the *dharma* and destroying the *dharma* are shown as one. One uses the slaughter of ten thousand monks as an analogy; the other feigns inviting ten thousand monks. Practitioners must scrutinize their intentions—relying on those with great virtue and strength to protect the *dharma*, not flaunting wealth to invite disaster.

At the chapter’s start:
*"The Pilgrim asks his disciples, ‘What place is this?’ The traveler replies, ‘I do not know, I do not know.’"*
These two *"I do not know"* are the key insight.

Human hearts are unfathomable, and circumstances ever-changing. A tiger may sit guard at the gate, yet the host invites monks to a feast—how can one say one cannot eat at a tiger’s mouth? The surname *Kòu* (寇) suggests banditry, yet the host shows no plundering intent—why suspect the *Kòu* clan and harbor doubts? An old woman fears no ugliness, recognizing the celestial and human realms—why then the shift from respect to rudeness? The heart is unfathomable.

The son, though seemingly aligned, bows in submission—yet why does a good beginning turn to ruin? Circumstances are ever-changing. At the close of spring and dawn of summer, when the *dào* flows freely, listening to two discuss rise and fall demands vigilant reflection.

The **Copper Terrace Hall** is a place where one may share in the golden splendor; the **Earthly Spirits County**, a land fortunate to host men of outstanding talent.
*"It stirs the townsfolk to such alarm—startled and fearful, speculating and suspicious, crowding around to争看 [peer at the spectacle]!"*
This depicts those who fail to **韬晦 [conceal their brilliance]** and expose their **圭角 [sharp talents]**, inspiring awe and dread among the ignorant and common.

Seeing the phrase *"万僧不阻 [ten thousand monks unobstructed]"*, one has already gained the **护法 [dharma-protectors’]** favor, and the **灵山 [Spiritual Vulture Peak]** is not far off.

What should be feared are the **妇人小子 [women and children]**, who, when slighted, harbor resentment and stir up strife—like the *"穿针儿 [Needle Girl]"* or *"小秀才 [petty scholar]"*, truly **绵里裹针 [silk-wrapped needles]** or **根莠败秀 [tares spoiling fine grain]**.

What should be guarded against is the **主人 [host]**, who craves fame, proudly displays his **奖善之额 [award for virtue]**, fills his doors with guests, and drowns out the clamor of drums and music.
With **结彩 [decorated banners]** and **张筵 [spread feasts]**, flaunting wealth and boasting of victory—he claims to honor teachers and seek friends, yet fails to see it as **开门揖盗 [inviting thieves by bowing at the door]**. Calling him a **寇员外 [bandit host]**, he brings ruin upon himself.

For indeed, **好客 [hospitality]** may attract unwanted attention, while **觊觎 [covetous schemers]** will seize the opportunity; **不贪 [not being greedy]** yet defying others’ wishes will invite **嫉妒 [envy]**, and the envious will bear grudges.
As the saying goes:
*"无贪犹取恕 [Refusing greed is akin to granting pardon]，
剧喜必生优 [Excessive joy breeds sorrow]，
众女兢闺中 [All women tremble within their chambers]，
独退反成怒 [Yet the one who withdraws alone provokes wrath]."*

When **Tang Seng [the monk Xuanzang]** arrived at the **华光行院 [Hua Guang Monastery]**, he saw its opulence and brilliance yet found its conduct contrary to the **良贾深藏 [virtuous merchant’s principle of concealing his wares]**.

Suddenly, a dark cloud and heavy rain descended in an instant—just as the saying goes:
*"天有不测风云 [Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds]，
人有旦夕祸福 [Man has fortunes that shift like morning and evening]."*
One must ever be on guard.

Thus concludes:
*"泰极还有否 [Prosperity at its peak still harbors decline]，
乐处又逢悲 [Joy’s abode meets sorrow once more]."*
Truly so.

**Chapter Ninety-Seventh: The Golden Reward for External Protection Meets Demon Poison, The Sacred Manifests the Hidden Soul to Save Its Origin**

A disciple of enlightenment remarked: This follows from the preceding passage, illustrating the unfathomable nature of human hearts and the ever-shifting course of events—how prosperity harbors decline, and joy meets sorrow. There is nothing strange in this.

One must penetrate the subtle principles of yin-yang correspondence and preempt the perils of unpredictable transformations.

By leveraging mighty strength to subdue the ignorant masses and deploying divine powers to safeguard the original essence, this tale stands in stark contrast to the *Monkey King’s Rebellion*.

They, through the destruction of the Dharma, slaughtered ten thousand monks—yet never a monk of renown—and required the collusion of the Four Assemblies to complete the deed. Wickedness, yet not yet the height of wickedness!

Here, through the protection of the Dharma, ten thousand monks were fed—yet none were truly virtuous—and the Four Assemblies conspired to fulfill the ritual. Auspicious, yet not yet the full measure of auspiciousness!

Seeing that fortune and misfortune have no ultimate end, yet human desires remain insatiable.

They avoided execution in the chest only to fall prey to thieves,
while here, avoiding the alms only to be robbed and imprisoned.

They, as officials, pursued thieves and captured the Four Assemblies,
while here, the Four Assemblies seized thieves only to be apprehended by the officials.

They stole garments and headgear in secret from the second-storey inn,
while here, they openly presented a *kashaya* before the jailer.

They killed monks and yet shaved their own heads in repentance,
while here, they fed monks and yet met with sudden, violent retribution.

They awoke to enlightenment after a night of evil,
while here, they fell into eternal slumber after an instant of virtue.

They used a thousand hands to shave monks across the land,
while here, a single kick sent them sprawling through the entire county hall.

They, mother and son, plotted against the guest in secret,
while here, mother and child conspired to ensnare the monk.

They, the Pilgrim, revealed past lives to a widow in plain speech,
while here, the old man and his mother mimicked idle gossip behind his back.

They displayed their prowess in the mortal realm,
while here, they secretly wielded divine powers in the underworld.

They, the shaven monk, was the Pilgrim—yet remained utterly unaware,
while here, the thief was no member of the Four Assemblies—yet insisted on the pretense.

They, facing the destruction of the Dharma, revered the Law,
while here, encountering its protection, they violated it.

They, the Pilgrim, disguised as a merchant among the vulgar,
while here, the Pilgrim feigned as a ghost and invoked spirits.

They saw that evil could not be relied upon,
while here, they saw that virtue could not be boasted of.

As for this very tale:
The household head bore the surname *Kou* and was robbed by *Kou* [bandits],
while Tang Seng sought the Dao and instead encountered thieves.

The deceased household head spoke though dead,
while the living bandit remained mute.

The monk acted as the examining magistrate and freed the true thief,
while the prefect, holding false accusations, exonerated the monk.

The master and disciples returned the stolen goods only to be accused of receiving them,
while the thieves, though robbing and plundering, lost their spoils.

The false accuser spoke recklessly with fabricated tongues,
yet the evidence of the stolen goods stood undeniable.

The innocent, though cleared at the trial’s end,
only saw their lifespan extended in vain.

In life, they refused to harbor the monk,
yet in death, the monk returned unexpectedly.

Flower-bedecked, they sent the monk out with drums and music resounding,
while bright and clear, they invited thieves in—only to weep in sorrow upon the floor.

Events twist and turn, reversing and inverting,
defying all description, utterly beyond naming.

The overall description portrays those with wealth as bound to secretly suffer misfortune,
while those of the Dao/Way are prone to trials and tribulations.
It is not through possessing the might to trample the entire county with a single kick,
that one can subdue the ignorant masses and dispel the venom of demons—
thus, those who follow the Dao/Way must diligently uphold their foundation,
secretly fortify themselves, lest they falter even once.

What is this "great kicking power"?
Wealth without hoarding is great kicking power;
Fame without clinging is great kicking power;
Power without misuse is great kicking power;
Law without display is great kicking power.
Softness and weakness as strength, in harmony with the world without contention—
even the finest armor of all ages cannot harm them, this is great kicking power;
Discerning omens and timing one’s actions, advancing and retreating with rectitude—
neither water nor fire, nor tigers or rhinoceroses can harm them, this is great kicking power.
Ah! Such virtues can indeed be practiced!

Thus, it concludes:
*"The earth vast can shelter malevolent deeds,
the heavens high never fail those of pure virtue.
Steady and unhurried along the Path of the Tathāgata,
Only reaching the Lotus Sutra’s blissful gate."*

The commentator says this chapter marks the end of the hells,
and the next begins the heavens—
a view not without insight.

Yet heavens and hells, the realms of principle and desire,
are ever interchanging—
no true end or beginning exists.
The Tang monk’s Dao/Way not yet perfected,
his mind not yet pure, cannot escape the hells’ burdens.

At the **Lingyun Crossing** and the **Bridge of a Single Plank**,
it still resembles the hells’ grim scenes.
Only when he boards the **Bottomless Ship** and reaches the other shore,
does he truly escape the sea of suffering.

The notion of beginning and end is but a vague perception.

---
**Chapter Ninety-Eight**
*"When the Monkey is Tamed and the Horse Subdued, Only Then Does He Escape the Shell"*
*"When Merit is Fulfilled and the Path Complete, He Sees the True Suchness"*

The master said:
*"The venerable patriarch, in his compassion for the dull and confused nature of sentient beings,
feared they might not grasp the meaning—
thus, this passage leads them from the very ground of reality,
so that they may tread firmly and dispel all doubt, fear, and hesitation.
Ah! The **Lingyun Crossing**, the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, and the **Bottomless Ship**—
these are truly the most perilous and the most insubstantial.
How then does it say 'treading firm ground'?
If the intent were not made clear in this division,
the patriarch’s original purpose in crafting the **Golden Elixir** would not be passed on,
and the immortal master’s intention in composing the *Journey to the West* to guide the world
would ultimately fail.
Thus, the common folk, lost in the vast sea of suffering,
would have no footing to stand;
the ordinary and vulgar, swept along in the endless cycle of rebirth,
would find no way to rise above."*

Those who study Buddhism and sit in meditation are like grinding bricks to make a mirror—
a hundred attempts yield not a single success.
Those who study Dao and attain the Way are like drawing cakes to stave off hunger—
utterly without real benefit.
Those who study the sages and perfect their nature are like threading a needle in lightning—
they pass it by in plain sight.

Better to take the straight path of the **Lingyun Crossing**, the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, and the **Bottomless Ship**—
for these are the ways of firm footing.

Laozi says:
*"Man’s greatest affliction lies in his having a body.
If I had no body, what affliction could there be?"*
For so long as one has a body, there will be affliction.
To escape the greatest affliction, one must embody the ultimate Dao.
To embody the ultimate Dao, one must clarify the original heart.

The heart is the substance of the Dao;
the Dao is the function of the heart.
When one examines the heart and observes nature,
the round and luminous self-illumination arises naturally,
and the function of non-action is spontaneously fulfilled.
Without contrivance, one suddenly transcends the other shore;
all phenomena are suddenly abandoned, not a speck of dust adheres.
The body cannot burden the nature, the world cannot disturb the true self—
what affliction could possibly remain?

This is the realm of the supreme sage, whose true essence is unblemished.
The heart, like a bright mirror, receives without accepting;
responding to circumstances, harmonious yet not leading,
thus able to overcome all things without harm—
the wondrous Dao of supreme truth!

Alas, the common folk are dull and deluded, lost in their original nature,
clinging to their bodies, fearing death and craving life—
thus they ultimately fail to awaken and verify the truth.

The Yellow Emperor and Laozi pitied their greed and attachment,
so they taught methods of nurturing life to guide them according to their desires,
gradually leading them onward.
This is the art of the Golden Elixir—
a method for the average person, a firm-footed practice,
enabling them to gain purchase and gradually cross to the other shore.
The Master of Purple Yang expounded this thoroughly in the *Awakening to Reality* and detailed it extensively in the *Postscript*.

This *Journey to the West* is the immortal master’s use of Tang Sanzang—
one who awakens gradually as a model of firm footing.
Through the intent of seeking scriptures, amid countless trials,
he is led to the **Lingyun Crossing**, the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, and the **Bottomless Ship**,
so that he may transcend the mundane and need not fear or doubt.
The summit of the Soul Mountain is none other than the self, naturally attained.

Now let us clarify the true meaning of **"Lingyun," "Single Plank," and "Bottomless."**
The Great Dao is broad and straight, like a whetstone or an arrow—
what are these images of "Lingyun," "Single Plank," and "Bottomless"?

Because people’s understanding is shallow and dimmed by desires,
the other shore seems distant as the clouds—
yet if one views all things with detachment, standing beyond the world,
nurturing the vast and boundless *qi*,
it will fill the **Lingyun Crossing**.

Because people act recklessly without restraint, deceiving themselves in secret,
yet when they reflect, they tremble with dread—
like a **Bridge of a Single Plank**—
if one is diligent and cautious, treading carefully as though on thin ice,
then the spirit of solitary vigilance will traverse the **Bridge of a Single Plank**.

Is this not the true realm of genuine practice?
Yet it must be done with sincerity, not achieved through imitation;
it lies in examining things, not in clinging to one-sidedness.

Now the **"Bottomless Boat"** is devised precisely for those who find the **Lingyun Crossing** difficult to traverse and the **Bridge of a Single Plank** difficult to walk. Those who find it difficult to cross and walk are simply those who love their bodies.

Thus, if one loves their body while desiring to cross, they must use a boat—and if they use a boat, they must have a bottom. Without a bottom, it is drowning the body; if drowning the body, it is better not to cross or walk at all—then how can it be called love? Not knowing that a boat has a bottom means loving the body while actually drowning it; without a bottom, it is not loving the body yet not drowning it.

Why? People do not know that a boat *with* a bottom is hollow, while a boat *without* a bottom is solid. A boat with a bottom is the kind people use daily—it saves the body from drowning, yet some fear drowning and refuse to use it; a boat without a bottom is the kind people use once—it saves the body yet *must* drown it, and there will never be those who fear drowning and refuse to use it.

Now, let us test those who have traveled the road for a long time and ask them: *"If there were a bottomless boat, would you board it?"* People will surely be angry, calling it either foolishness or madness, unaware that they are already boarding a bottomless boat and drowning themselves.

Again, let us test those who have traveled the road for a long time and ask them: *"If there were a bottomless boat that would never drown you, would you board it?"* People will again be angry, calling it either falsehood or deceit, unaware that there are those who board boats with bottoms and yet still drown.

Thus, the bottomless boat is one that all must board yet cannot treat lightly. If one has *vast qi* yet cannot nurture it well, or has a spirit of solitary vigilance yet cannot examine things thoroughly, they have not yet reached the **Lingyun Crossing** or the **Bridge of a Single Plank**—they are like an ape that is strong yet a horse that is unbroken, unable to board the boat and cross.

If one can nurture their *vast qi* well, maintain solitary vigilance, and reach the **Lingyun Crossing** and the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, yet still wishes to board a boat with a bottom to cross, they are like an ape that is not yet mature and a horse that is not yet trained—unable to board the boat and ask to cross.

An ape must be fully integrated and unobstructed before it is called mature; a horse must have its strength fully transformed before it is called trained. Confucius said: *"Hear the Dao in the morning, die in the evening—what more can one ask?"* Meaning, without hearing the Dao, death is impossible; but if one hears the Dao, even death is acceptable.

This is called *"the ape is mature, the horse is trained, only then can one shed the shell."* Without the ape being mature and the horse trained, one cannot board the bottomless boat. People all know that a bottomless boat can drown the body, yet they do not know it cannot drown the mature ape and trained horse. People all know that a bottomless boat can drown the body and never rise again, yet they do not know that a bottomless boat cannot drown the trained and mature ape and horse, and they will rise without drowning.

When people board a bottomless boat yet still believe it has a bottom, it truly has a bottom, yet they do not know they will drown and never rise. Again, when they see others board a bottomless boat and believe it has no bottom, that they will drown and never rise, it truly is rising without drowning, yet they do not know.

Though it is the same bottomless boat, one assumes it has a bottom and will not drown; though it is the same bottomless boat, there is a vast difference between drowning and not drowning, yet they assume it is the same drowning with no distinction.

Thus, what they call a boat *with* a bottom is actually bottomless; what we call a boat *without* a bottom is actually bottomed. Does the boat with a bottom truly float? Is the boat without a bottom truly stable? Is the boat with a bottom truly stable? Is the boat without a bottom truly stable?

Therefore, to board a bottomless boat and truly be stable is something only the mature ape and trained horse can do. To make the ape mature and the horse trained requires the alchemical work of *jin dan*.

The maturity of the ape is not the maturity of the mind, but the seamless integration of the Dao itself; the training of the horse is not the training of the will, but the complete transformation of one’s cultivation. Mistaking the mind for the ape and the will for the horse is not the grounded practice of reality.

In the text, those who *"fake the realm and forcefully bow"* are not the mature ape and trained horse; those who *"reach the true realm and dismount"* are the mature ape and trained horse.

*"Dao-children guiding"* is the alchemical essence; *"being tricked by Guanyin"* is not trickery, but seeing that Tang Seng can progress gradually yet not suddenly.

*"Bathing"* is the verification of the mature ape and trained horse; *"yesterday in rags, today resplendent"* is the completion of *jin dan* and shedding the mundane.

*"Not yet on the Cloud Path, must walk the original path"*—this clarifies that abandoning the path of cultivating immortality cannot reach the sacred mountain, seeing Tang Seng’s necessity of gradual progress.

*"Clouds come, clouds go, never truly stepping on this ground"*—this reveals the traveler’s ability to attain sudden enlightenment without gradual progression.

*"Just walk out from the Hall of the Celestial Realm, the back door is right there"*—after action, there is non-action.

*"Tang Seng sees the living water flowing, startled and mistakenly points; the traveler laughs, saying, ‘No mistake.’ Pointing to the great bridge, one must cross over it to attain the Way"*—this shows that this body has not yet left the mundane, danger still remains, and one must nurture *qi* until it cannot be nurtured further, maintain solitary vigilance until it cannot be maintained further, and only then can the Way be attained. This is the true time of genuine practice, finding no other path, hence it is said: *"This is the path, this is the path!"*

*"The traveler steps onto the bridge, running back and forth"*—this is the sudden enlightenment of the superior sage, the ape being naturally mature.

Tang Seng says: *"Difficult! Difficult!"*

Eight Steppings says: *"Slippery! Slippery! Slippery!"*—this is the doubt and fear of the mediocre, as if they would ride the clouds and cross swiftly, yet this is the path of delusion taken by those who stray. Hence, the Traveler urgently stops them, forbidding deviation and guiding them back to the true, solid Dao.

After shedding the mortal shell, master and disciple owe no thanks to each other—this embodies the principle of *er shi ju de* (both benefactors and beneficiaries), the essence of giving both *fa* (law/teaching) and wealth. Yet in this world, superior sages are few while mediocre minds prevail. None dare avoid death, though they must die; none dare board the bottomless ship, though they must board it. Only the Dao of *jin dan* (Golden Elixir) offers broad observation with true stability and solidity.

Before attaining *jin dan*, the body is not without peril; after attaining it, the body remains a hindrance to the Dao. Though one may choose not to ascend, it is not as superior as ascending to transcendence. As in the *Chuan Deng Lu* (Record of the Lamp): Lü Zu wandered the Lougu Platform, listening to Huanglong Jian’s Zen teachings. The master, knowing Lü was a transcendent, asked: *"Who sits below—the river folk?"* Lü replied: *"A wandering monk of clouds and water."* The master said: *"What if the clouds disperse and the water dries?"* Lü had no answer. The master spoke again: *"Huanglong appears."* Lü departed, leaving a poem:

*"Abandoning the gourd-bag, smashing the lute,
Now I no longer covet mercury’s gold.
Since first meeting Huanglong’s truth,
I regret my past misguided heart."*

This is not regret for the error of mercury and gold, but regret for not realizing their noble transformation. Hence another poem says:

*"The Bag Monk ascends to Mingzhou,
Staff in hand, sandals on feet, wandering freely.
Though you may manifest in myriad forms,
Each body still bears its own sorrow."*

This speaks further of transcendence within transformation. Thus, great Buddhas and immortals—some depart like cicadas shedding their shells, some perish in flames, some return westward by foot, some climb trees to demonstrate cultivation, some suffer harm to repay debts—though their traces differ, all await the moment when the ape is mature and the horse is tamed.

For they deeply understand that the physical form cannot endure, while the true spirit eternally persists. This is why the guiding masters emphasize *"wan dong anran ziran"* (ten thousand movements in tranquil ease).

*"Stepping on the ship, unable to stand"*—this is the mind sinking into fear of death at the moment of ascent.
*"One pull and you’re raised"*—this is the daily practice of *jin dan* pulling you along; not you alone, but all of us.
*"Downstream, floating corpses—all say, ‘It’s you, it’s you’"*—not you alone, but all of you.

At this stage, how could one not rejoice? This is the boundless wisdom, the birth into the other shore, the supreme truth beyond limits—what need is there for *"lingyun"* (soaring clouds), *"du mu"* (single plank), or *"wudi"* (bottomless ship)?

Liberated from the mortal coil, the work is complete, the path fulfilled.
Adrift atop the Soul-Mountain’s peak, bowing beneath the Tathagata’s feet,
Only then does one recognize Avalokiteshvara’s compassion—
A single mind entrusted to the *One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Fourteen* volumes,
Yet ultimately contained within the *True Scripture of No-Writing*.

This Scripture is most exalted and precious—guard against transmitting it with empty hands, lest customs grow vulgar and ignorant, leading to disrespect and arrogance. Use the *No-Writing Scripture* for the superior sage, the *Written Scripture* for the masses. The Buddha’s differentiation in transmission mirrors Confucius’ teaching tailored to the student—how different can they be?

Ananda first transmitted the *No-Writing True Scripture*—not out of deceit, but fear of disrespect. Later, he exchanged it for the *Five Thousand Forty-Eight Volume Written Scripture*—transmitting the Golden Elixir with the Golden Bowl. For the *No-Writing* is the sudden method, the *Written* the gradual. Sudden is non-action, gradual is action. From gradual to sudden, from action to non-action—all are True Scriptures. The True Scripture never departs from the *No-Writing River Diagram* and the *Written I Ching*, hence it is said:

*"The source of the Three Teachings—treasure it! Cherish it!
Within lie the secrets of immortality and Dao attainment,
Unveiling the marvelous prescriptions for ten thousand transformations."*

The text proposes: *"A total of fourteen years—five thousand forty-eight days, yet eight days short—does not align with the hidden numbers."* Ah! Truly a marvelous prescription!

Readers may claim this book shows Daoist and Buddhist origins as one, with Dao as the gateway and Zen as the ultimate attainment—this seems plausible! Yet unknown is that this book solely expounds the Great Dao of the alchemical Golden Elixir. The phrase *"attaining immortality and completing the Way"* serves as its entire footnote.

Buddha and Immortal cannot be realized without the Golden Elixir—only through transforming action into non-action. There is no superiority or inferiority. Immortal is Buddha; Buddha is Immortal. The Buddha is called *"Great Awakened Golden Immortal,"* while the Immortal is named *"Great Luo True Immortal."* One and two, two and one.

Thus it concludes:
*"Seeing nature, clarifying mind, and communing with the Buddha-patriarchs—
When virtue is complete and practice fulfilled, one ascends to the skies."*

**Ninety-ninth Chapter**
*"Ninety-nine times complete, demons eradicated—
Three threes fulfilled, the Way returns to its root."*

The disciple of enlightenment says: This passage elucidates the meaning of *"even a hair’s breadth difference prevents elixir completion."*

To let mortals penetrate yin-yang, deeply grasp transformation, measure time like an incense clock, and precisely calculate the fire’s moment—neither excess nor deficiency—only then may one obtain the Golden Elixir, shed the mortal frame, and renew the bones. Should even a hair’s breadth differ, it is like walking ninety paces in a hundred-mile journey.

The poem concludes with *"Anciently, its mysteries align with *The Concordance of the Three*"*—this is the book’s entire essence.

The *River of Heavenly Passage* marks the halfway point of the ten thousand eight thousand [stages], yet here it proposes returning to origin to complete the nine nines. It reveals that lacking one in nine nines is like abandoning the halfway mark in vain.

The term *"Heavenly Passage"* is chosen because the heavens span fifty-four thousand *li*—the measure of one *藏* (treasure-house). This is when the Great Sage rescues the primordial essence with a fish basket.

Though called half the labor, the latter half achieves only the former half. Laozi said: *"The Mysterious, yet more mysterious."* The first *"Mysterious"* refers to the first half; the *"yet more"* to the second.

How could one recognize this without the patriarchs’ direct transmission of the profound intent? Ah! The meaning of *Heavenly Passage* and return to origin is profound. Studying the poem *"Nine Nines Return to Truth"* may grant some enlightenment.

The traveler lifts his head and gazes back: *"Here! Here!"*

The reader may dismiss the traveler’s words as idle chatter, yet they hold profound significance. Though one recognizes the *Heavenly Passage*’s location, why does he repeat it so emphatically? His words imply that even the slightest error in practice occurs here—thus, one must be vigilant and remember it well.

*"Eight Rules [Precepts] said to Sand Monk: ‘Surely this is your ancestral home!’
The traveler replied: ‘No! No! This is the *Heavenly Passage*!’*
To call it ancestral home yet insistently correct it—what a warning!

The traveler declared: *“Cannot depart! Cannot depart!”*
This speaks of the *Nine Nines*’ inherent Dao-work, beyond human effort—*"There is naturally true fire, why need fuel or fanning?"*

The old tortoise cried: *“Holy Sage! Here! Here!”*
Meaning: *From here one goes, and to here one returns.*

*"The four disciples and five horses, all borne upon his back"*—this mirrors the *River Diagram*’s symbolism.
The Five Phases return to the One *Taiqi*, with no distinction of self or other, as one attains their original form—thus, the Dao returns to its root and fulfills its mandate.

When the old tortoise suddenly questions and Master Tang remains silent, then shakes his body, all fall into the water—readers must not misinterpret this. At this juncture, Master Tang’s Dao-fruit is already complete; why would he still lack a trial? It must be supplemented?

Indeed, *refining the elixir* and *returning to origin* occur here—even the slightest misstep cannot yield true attainment. The tortoise’s tale of forgotten trust serves as a critical warning at the *Heavenly Passage*’s most vital moment, emphasizing that true faith must be held here, lest any error arise.

This is the true *cloak and bowl* of the *Eight Vajra Protectors*, whispering, *“Thus and thus—follow the Bodhisattva’s precepts, not to be violated.”*
It cannot be explained through words alone.

If one interprets the Dao-body as pure *Qian* [Creative], admitting no trace of *yin* [Receptive], or that the *disaster star* remains unfulfilled and still relies on this place to complete it—then one fails to grasp the subtlety of *returning to origin*.

*"The Three Treasures pressed the sutra, Sand Monk pressed the sutra, the traveler guarded left and right to prevent *yin* demons from wasting [the qi]."*
This reveals that the sutra and this place are prone to error, requiring urgent protection until the *yin* dissipates.

The traveler said: *“This sutra steals the creative power of Heaven and Earth, enduring as long as the cosmos, as bright as sun and moon, with eternal spring and an unbroken *dharma-body.”*
These are the true meanings of *golden elixir*, not mere praise.

At the brink of completion, one must fear external demons sapping or stealing the work—vigilance must be absolute, never lax.

When the sutra’s tail is stained, *“This is the mystery of Heaven and Earth’s incompleteness, beyond human power to remedy.”*
Laozi said: *“Great completion seems deficient—its use is inexhaustible.”*

Readers claim that Heaven and Earth’s deficiency is, in fact, the grandest truth—mere idle speculation.

Some say the old tortoise’s words exposed it, but I say they ruined it. If *“Heaven and Earth’s incompleteness”* is already a mystery, why must it be explained? Only a true master’s transmission can reveal its *“incompleteness”*—how could one guess its meaning?

Ah! Only those who grasp the ebb and flow of the *tidal source* will know the body’s own fullness and emptiness.

The Chen Family Village’s **Deng** and **Qing** welcomed him with gratitude, repaying the old debt of saving their children—summoning **Chen Guanbao** to present a **yīncín** of gold in thanks, and founding the **Jiùshēng Temple**. All this was the beginning and end of **Huan Yuán’s** [Returning to the Origin] affairs.

Fame cannot be dwelled upon for long;
The dusty world is no place for a guest to linger.
*"A true person does not reveal their form—
Revealing it, they are no true person."*
*"Fragrant breezes drift and rise from emptiness"—
The deeds of a true man are complete.

Thus it is said:
*"When the elixir is perfected, one recognizes the original face,
Healthy as ever, bowing to the master."*

**Chapter 100: Directly Returning to the Eastern Land**
**The Five Saints Achieve Perfection**

**Wu Yīzǐ** said: This entire section concludes the **Jīndān** [Golden Elixir] teachings, encapsulating its essence in the poem’s two lines:
*"The five phases’ wondrous hues return to void and stillness,
A hundred false names are all empty."*

For **Jīndān** arises from the convergence of the five phases, though initially it seems deliberate, in the end it is effortless—hence the saying:
*"When the Dao’s fruit is complete, tranquility is natural."*

All its dangers and strangenesses are but emptiness.

The *Yì* says:
*"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao."*
Yin and yang are originally one **qi**, which encompasses the five phases.

When the five phases converge and yin and yang harmonize,
Heaven and Earth take their places, and all things flourish—
This is the ultimate, supreme Dao of beginning and end.
If yin is excessive or yang is solitary,
Lacking balance and harmony, how could perfection be achieved?
This contradicts the natural order of **tianming** [Heaven’s mandate] and **suìxìng** [following one’s nature],
And fails to grasp their shared origin—
Where the divine transformations reside.

**Note:** In Buddhist scriptures, the opening *"Yēyǒutúo, Móxūluó"* refers to when the Buddha, before his renunciation, married **Yēyǒutúo** and fathered **Móxūluó**. After twelve years of asceticism, he returned and reunited with them. His words at his parents’ funeral were filled with profound sorrow.

When speaking to the archer Shì about the teachings of the celestial deities,
He often spoke of filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and sincerity—
These were never teachings that strayed from my own **yǐlún** [inherent moral principles].

**Note:** Laozi’s son was named Zōng, who became a general of Wei.
Zōng’s son, Zhù, inscribed the **yǔ** [womb/palace] of his mother;
The **xuánsūn** [mysterious grandson], Jiǎ, served under Emperor Wen of Han;
Jiǎ’s son, Xiè, became the tutor of the Prince of Jiaoxi.
His descendants flourished in the world, all transmitting the virtues of loyalty and filial piety.
Later generations, neglecting to cultivate their inner essence and exert their efforts,
Instead coerced their emotions and attachments,
Claiming it to be a shortcut to transcendence—
Thus, his disciples all lived as widows and widowers, without wives or children.
How could this be the teaching of **Buddha** or **Laozi**?

To disregard the distinctions between male and female,
To abandon the proper order of clothing and ritual,
And merely speak of the study of mind and nature—
This may work within the confines of a secluded meditation chamber,
But applied to the governance of the world, how few could avoid great chaos!
No wonder the Confucian scholars took the opportunity to disparage it!

Between the Jin, Liang, Tang, and Song dynasties,
Many rulers, ministers, and great officials studied under them,
Listened to their teachings, and only **Chánglí** [Khan Li, i.e., Han Yu] did not follow.
Later, he even befriended a leading monk,
And in his old age, he was deceived by alchemy, never reaching its true depths.

From *Zhūzǐ’s Collected Sayings*:
*"Someone asked, ‘How does Laozi’s ‘wu’ [無, non-being] differ from Buddhism’s ‘wu’?’
He replied: ‘Laozi’s non-being is based on the presence of the old [order],
As in his saying: *“Wu [無, non-being], to observe its mystery; yǒu [有, being], to observe its limits.”*
But Buddhism’s non-being treats Heaven and Earth as illusions,
And the four **dà** [great elements] as false combinations—
This is absolute non-being.’"*

Foolishly, I observe:
Zhūzǐ ultimately conceded to **Huángdān** [Yellow Court, i.e., Daoist alchemy] a single point,
Deeming it absolute non-being,
Yet failing to recognize its absolute presence.
If one knew it as absolute presence,
Then one would see it aligns with Laozi’s *yǒu* [有, being] and cannot differ;
If one knew the unity of **Laozi** and **Buddhism**,
Then one would see it shares the same origin with **Confucianism** and cannot differ.

Reading the line *“The sutra’s origin is paired with the five phases,”*
Do the teachings of the five phases in all these scriptures truly differ from
Our Confucian sayings of **rén** [benevolence], **yì** [righteousness], **lǐ** [ritual propriety], **zhì** [wisdom], and **xìn** [trustworthiness]?
No!

*"The branches face east but return to the west"*—
This refers to **Xuánzàng** [Tripitaka Master Xuanzang, i.e., Xuanzang]’s actual journey to fetch the sutras,
And even this single passage reveals his sincerity could move all things,
While Heaven’s will silently responded with its own **líng** [numinous resonance].

The **bādà jīnjiāng** [Eight Great Vajra Protectors] called from the sky:
*"Holy monk, go now and deliver the sutra,
Then return immediately!"*
The **Sānjiāng** [Three Treasures] recounted the deeds and travels of his three disciples,
Exactly embodying the essence of delivering the sutra.
*"Coming and going in eight days’ span—*
This means only within the three-five **miàodào** [mysterious transformations] does it unfold.
The passage states: *“Five days eastward, three days westward upon return,”*
Coming five, returning three—
It clearly indicates the truth,
Yet people fail to awaken to it.

Readers say such passages are beyond thought or imitation,
Yet how can one reconcile *“Three-five as one: three characters—*
How few in ancient and modern times truly understand this!”?

**Jīn** [gold], **jǐn** [restraint], **jìn** [prohibition]—
No need to stir the mind; naturally, they fall away.
Before the Dao is perfected,
One must rely on methods and restraints;
Gold is first employed,
Like the roots generated by thought—
Once stirred, they cannot be moved.
After the Dao is perfected,
One attains serene stillness, free from thought,
Breaking beyond all boundaries—
Gold becomes useless;
One does not seek to cast it off, yet it casts itself off.
As said: *“The ferry-boat left on the river, the ladder discarded in the sky—*
All is abandoned upon arrival.”

The **Zhāngchūn** [Long Spring] Master **Qiū Zhēnrén** [Hill True Person] left this book,
Originally intending to reveal the supreme **jīndān** [gold elixir] Dao to future generations,
Yet he borrowed the story of Xuanzang’s quest for the sutras
To expound and clarify,
Illustrating how the **Sānjiāng** [Three Treasures] shed their mortal shells to attain truth—
By fulfilling nature to reach **mìng** [fate];
And how the three disciples’ illusory bodies became true—
By cultivating **mìng** [fate] to fulfill nature.
Though their paths differed in gradual and sudden stages,
Their ultimate success was one:
All became **dàjué** [greatly awakened] golden immortals.
Divided into five, each became a holy one;
United as one, they all became the **zhēnyǐ** [true unity] of the gold elixir.
Later people failed to recognize this as the **great Dao of the immortals**,
Instead calling it **Buddhist fiction**,
And clinging to empty talk of **xīnyuán yǐmǎ** [mind-monkey, heart-horse],
Or **xīnmiè mómiè** [mind-extinction, demon-extinction],
Their understanding as narrow as viewing through a tube or measuring with a ladle—
How far they have strayed!

The **Zǐyáng** [Purple Yang] True Person said:
*"Jīn Gōng was originally a son of the eastern household,
Sent westward to a neighboring clan to take a mortal form and be born.
When he recognized the call and returned to his dwelling to nurture [the Dao],
He paired with the **xī** [radiant] maiden as a bond of affection.
Again, he said: *“To learn the Dao of immortality, one must learn the Dao of celestial immortality,
And only the gold elixir is the most direct path.
When the two essences unite, nature and fate align,
And the five phases gather like the coiled dragons and phoenixes of the **húlóng pán** [Peak of the Tiger and Dragon].
Originally paired by the **wùjǐ** [Earthly Branch, i.e., the fifth and sixth phases],
Thus the husband and wife settle in eternal harmony.
Wait only until the work is complete at the northern gate,
Where nine clouds’ radiance reveals the soaring cranes.”*
This is the mystery of *“directly returning to the eastern lands, the five saints attaining truth.”*

Every person inherently possesses the **numina** [灵根] of immortality, saints, or Buddhas.
From **post-heaven** [后天] to **pre-heaven** [先天],
Those who perfect it are not bound to the east or the west—
The principle is simple, the attainment effortless.
Why should cultivators wait for another life or another world?
All teachings ultimately boil down to *“abandoning illusion to attain truth.”*
This is why I composed *Zhēn yì* [True Explication].

**My exhortation, your exhortation, the exhortation of all under Heaven and future generations—**
All must strive!
