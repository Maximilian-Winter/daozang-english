# 唐易州龙兴观道德经碑文

**Laozi’s Dao De Jing**
*Tang Dynasty Yizhou Longxing Temple Stele Edition*

**Chapter One**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
Nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth;
Named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.
From constant non-being, one observes its mystery;
From constant being, one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet differ in name.
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and again profound—
The gateway to all mysteries.

**Chapter Two**
When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.
Thus being and non-being produce each other,
Difficult and easy complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low incline toward each other,
Tones and voices harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.
Therefore the sage abides in non-action,
Practices wordless teaching.
The ten thousand things arise yet he does not reject them,
Gives birth yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Accomplishes yet does not dwell.
Only because he does not dwell,
Does he not depart.

**Chapter Three**
Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending;
Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing;
Not displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from disorder.
Thus the sage’s governance:
Empties the heart,
Fills the belly,
Weakens the will,
Strengthens the bones.
Always keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,
So that those with knowledge dare not act.
Act thus, and nothing is ungoverned.

**Chapter Four**
The Dao is empty,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Profound!—
The ancestor of the ten thousand things.
It blunts sharpness,
Untangles knots,
Softens brilliance,
Merges with dust.
Submerged, it seems ever-present.
I do not know whose child it is—
It appears before the image of the Emperor.

**Chapter Five**
Heaven and earth are not humane;
They treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane;
He treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The space between heaven and earth—
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet not collapsing,
The more it moves, the more it produces.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
Better to hold to the center.

**Chapter Six**
The spirit of the valley never dies—
This is called the mysterious female.
The gateway of the mysterious female
Is the root of heaven and earth.
Subtly enduring, it seems to exist;
Its use is never exhausted.

**Chapter Seven**
Heaven is eternal, earth enduring.
Heaven and earth endure because they do not live for themselves.
Thus the sage places himself last yet comes first,
Sets himself aside yet remains.
Is it not because he is selfless
That he fulfills himself?

**Chapter Eight**
The highest good is like water.
Water benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend.
It dwells in places all others despise—
Thus it is close to the Dao.
In dwelling, be close to the land;
In the heart, be deep;
In giving, be humane;
In speech, be sincere;
In governance, be orderly;
In affairs, be capable;
In action, be timely.
Only by not contending
Does one avoid blame.

**Chapter Nine**
To hold and fill to overflowing
Is not as good as stopping.
To sharpen to a point
Cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall,
None can guard them.
Wealth and honor with arrogance
Bring self-inflicted misfortune.
To withdraw when the work is done,
When the name is achieved—
This is the Dao of heaven.

**Chapter Ten**
In carrying spirit and embracing unity,
Can you never part from them?
In concentrating qi to attain softness,
Can you be like an infant?
In cleansing and purifying your profound vision,
Can you be without flaw?
In loving the people and governing the state,
Can you practice non-action?
In the opening and closing of heaven’s gates,
Can you play the female?
In understanding all directions,
Can you do so without knowledge?
Give birth and nurture,
Give birth yet do not possess,
Act yet do not rely,
Lead yet do not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

**Chapter Eleven**
Thirty spokes share one hub;
In its emptiness lies the cart’s usefulness.
Clay is shaped into a vessel;
In its emptiness lies the vessel’s usefulness.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room;
In its emptiness lies the room’s usefulness.
Thus what is present provides advantage,
While what is absent provides usefulness.

**Chapter Twelve**

**Chapter Twelve**
The five colors blind the eye;
The five tones deafen the ear;
The five flavors dull the palate;
Racing and hunting madden the heart;
Rare goods incite harmful conduct.
Thus the sage attends to the belly, not the eye—
Therefore, he rejects that and takes this.

**Chapter Thirteen**
Favor and disgrace are like shock,
Valuing great trouble as one’s own body.
What does “favor and disgrace are like shock” mean?
Favor is inferior.
Gaining it brings shock, losing it brings shock—
This is what “favor and disgrace are like shock” means.
What does “valuing great trouble as one’s own body” mean?
The reason I have great trouble
Is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body,
What trouble could I have?
Thus, one who values the body more than the world
May be entrusted with the world;
One who loves the body for the sake of the world
May be charged with the world.

**Chapter Fourteen**
Look for it and it cannot be seen—called *yí*;
Listen for it and it cannot be heard—called *xī*;
Grasp for it and it cannot be held—called *wēi*.
These three cannot be fully examined,
So they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright;
Below, it is not dark.
Endless, unnameable,
It returns to nothingness.
This is called the formless form,
The image of no-thing—
This is called *hūhuǎng*.
Meet it and you do not see its beginning;
Follow it and you do not see its end.
Hold to the ancient Dao
To master the present being.
To know the ancient beginning
Is called the thread of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifteen**
The masters of old who were skilled in the Dao
Were subtly profound and mysteriously penetrating,
Too deep to be known.
Because they could not be known,
I strain to describe them:
Cautious, as if crossing a winter stream;
Alert, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;
Reserved, as if a guest;
Yielding, as ice about to melt;
Simple, as uncarved wood;
Hollow, as a valley;
Opaque, as muddy water.
Who can still the turbid and make it gradually clear?
Who can rouse the still and make it gradually live?
Those who preserve this Dao
Do not desire fullness.
Because they are not full,
They can be worn yet ever renewed.

**Chapter Sixteen**
Attain utmost emptiness,
Abide in profound stillness.
The ten thousand things arise together,
And I observe their return.
Things flourish in abundance,
Each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
Stillness is called returning to life;
Returning to life is called constancy;
Knowing constancy is called clarity.
Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.
Knowing constancy brings acceptance;
Acceptance brings impartiality;
Impartiality brings kingship;
Kingship brings heaven;
Heaven brings the Dao;
The Dao brings enduringness—
To the end of one’s days, free from peril.

**Chapter Seventeen**
The highest rulers—those below know they exist;
Next, those they draw near and praise;
Next, those they fear;
Next, those they scorn.
Where trust is insufficient, distrust arises.
How carefully they weigh their words!
When their tasks are accomplished and affairs completed,
The people all say, “We are naturally thus.”

When tasks succeed and affairs are completed,
The people all say, “We are naturally thus.”

**Chapter Eighteen**
When the great Dao is abandoned, there are benevolence and righteousness.
When wisdom and intelligence emerge, there is great artifice.
When the six relations are disharmonious, there are filial piety and compassion.
When the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.

**Chapter Nineteen**
Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom—
The people will benefit a hundredfold;
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—
The people will return to filial piety and compassion;
Abandon skill, discard profit—
There will be no thieves or bandits.
These three sayings, as cultural refinements, are insufficient.
Thus, let there be something to which they belong:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce self-interest, diminish desires.

**Chapter Twenty**
Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.
Between “yes” and “ah,”
How far apart are they?
Between good and evil,
How great is the distance?
What others fear,
One cannot but fear.
Vast and boundless—its end is not yet!
The multitude bustle and brighten,
As if feasting on the great sacrifice,
As if ascending the springtime terrace.
I alone am quiescent, my spirit unaroused,
Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.
Adrift, adrift—with nowhere to return!
The multitude all have more than enough,
I alone seem bereft.
I possess the heart of a fool—so pure, so simple.
The common folk are clear and bright,
I alone am dim and dull.
The common folk are sharp and keen,
I alone am muddled and obscure.
Vast like the sea,
Drifting without cease.
The multitude all have purpose,
I alone am stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
And value the nourishment of the Mother.

**Chapter Twenty-One**
The fullness of great virtue
Follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
Only vague, only elusive.
Elusive and vague,
Yet within it are images;
Vague and elusive,
Yet within it are things.
Profound and obscure,
Yet within it is essence;
Its essence is most real,
Within it is trustworthiness.
From ancient times to the present,
Its name does not depart,
Through which we behold the origin of all things.
How do I know the nature of the origin of all things?
By this.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
To yield is to be preserved whole;
To be bent is to become straight;
To be hollow is to be filled;
To be tattered is to be renewed;
To want is to possess;
To have abundance is to be perplexed.
Therefore the sage embraces the One
And becomes the model for all under heaven.
Not seeing things from his own perspective, he is clear;
Not asserting himself, he is distinguished;
Not boasting, he gains merit;
Not priding himself, he endures.
It is precisely because he does not contend
That no one under heaven can contend with him.
The ancient saying, “To yield is to be preserved whole,”
Is no empty phrase.
Truly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Rare words are natural.
Fierce winds do not last the morning;
Torrential rains do not last the day.
Who brings these about?
Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot endure for long,
How much less can man?
Thus, those who act in accordance with the Dao
Are one with the Dao;
Those who are one with virtue
Are one with virtue;
Those who are one with loss
Are one with loss.
Where trust is insufficient,
There will be distrust.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;
One who strides cannot walk far;
One who sees himself is not enlightened;
One who asserts himself is not distinguished;
One who boasts achieves no merit;
One who prides himself does not endure.
In the Way, these are called
“Excess food and redundant deeds,”
Which some find detestable.
Therefore, those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
There is a thing, formless yet complete,
Born before heaven and earth.

Silent and void! It stands alone, unchanging,
Circling endlessly without peril,
It may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
I know not its name,
So I style it "Dao,"
And forcibly name it "Great."
Great means it flows ever onward,
Flowing ever onward means it goes far,
Going far means it returns.
Thus the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And the king is great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
And the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
Earth models itself on heaven,
Heaven models itself on the Dao,
And the Dao models itself on spontaneity.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
Gravity is the root of lightness,
Stillness the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the noble person travels all day
Yet never strays from the baggage wagon,
Though there be splendid sights,
He dwells in serene detachment.
How can the lord of ten thousand chariots
Treat his person lightly before all under heaven?
Lightness loses the ministers,
Restlessness loses the ruler.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
The skilled traveler leaves no tracks;
The skilled speaker makes no flaws;
The skilled reckoner needs no counting rods;
The skilled closer needs no bolts yet none can open;
The skilled binder needs no cords yet none can untie.
Thus the sage is always skilled at saving people,
And so abandons no one;
Always skilled at saving things,
And so abandons nothing.
This is called inheriting enlightenment.
The good person is the teacher of the bad;
The bad person is the resource of the good.
One who does not value the teacher
Or cherish the resource,
Though wise, is greatly deluded.
This is called the essential mystery.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
Know the masculine, hold to the feminine,
Become the world’s stream.
As the world’s stream,
Constant virtue never departs,
And one returns to infancy.
Know the white, hold to the black,
Become the world’s pattern.
As the world’s pattern,
Constant virtue never errs,
And one returns to the boundless.
Know the glorious, hold to the humble,
Become the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley,
Constant virtue is ever sufficient,
And one returns to simplicity.
When simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels,
And the sage employs it as the chief of officials.
Thus the great system makes no cuts.

He who would take the world and act upon it,
I see that he will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel—
It cannot be acted upon.
Who acts upon it destroys it;
Who grasps it loses it.

For things sometimes lead and sometimes follow,
Sometimes breathe gently and sometimes blow,
Sometimes are strong and sometimes weak,
Sometimes endure and sometimes collapse.
Therefore the sage discards the excessive,
The extravagant, the extreme.

**Chapter Thirty**
One who rules men by the Dao
Does not use force to dominate the world,
For such things are wont to rebound:
Where armies march, thorns and brambles grow.
Thus the good commander achieves his aim and stops,
Without resorting to force.
He achieves his aim but does not boast,
Achieves his aim but does not vaunt,
Achieves his aim but does not exult,
Achieves his aim but does not presume—
This is to achieve one’s aim without force.
When things reach their prime, they age;
This is called “not the Dao.”
What is not the Dao soon ends.

**Chapter Thirty-One**
Fine weapons are ill-omened tools—
Things may detest them,
Thus the man of Dao does not abide by them.
The noble man at home honors the left,
But in war honors the right.
Weapons are ill-omened tools,
Not the tools of the noble man.
Only when unavoidable does he use them,
And he does so with calm restraint.
He does not glorify them;
To glorify them is to delight in killing.
One who delights in killing
Cannot achieve his will in the world.
Thus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
In inauspicious affairs, the right is honored.
Therefore the lieutenant general stands on the left,
The supreme general on the right.
When many are killed, one mourns them with sorrow;
When victorious in battle, one observes it with mourning rites.

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
The Dao is eternally nameless.

The uncarved block, though small,
No one in the world dares claim as subject.
If kings and lords could hold to it,
The ten thousand things would of themselves submit.

Heaven and earth unite,
To send down sweet dew—
None commands it, yet it falls evenly of itself.

Once names are established, there are bounds.
When names already exist,
Heaven knows where to halt.
Knowing where to halt, one avoids peril.

The Dao in the world
Is like streams and valleys to rivers and seas.

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
To know others is wisdom;
To know oneself is clarity.
To conquer others requires force;
To conquer oneself is strength.
To know contentment is wealth;
To act with vigor is resolve.
Not losing one’s place endures;
Dying yet not perishing is longevity.

**Chapter Thirty-Four**
The great Dao flows everywhere,
To left and right alike.
The ten thousand things depend on it to live, yet it does not refuse them;
Its work is accomplished, yet it claims no possession.
It nurtures the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master—
It may be called great.
Thus the sage never strives to be great,
And thereby achieves greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**
Hold to the great image,
And all under heaven will come.
They come and are not harmed,
But find peace, safety, and great tranquility.

Music and fine food
May make the passing traveler pause.
But the Dao, when spoken,
Is bland and without flavor—
To see, it is not enough to be seen;
To hear, it is not enough to be heard;
Yet its use is inexhaustible.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**
To gather it in, one must first expand it;
To weaken it, one must first strengthen it;

To enfeeble it, one must first fortify it;
To abolish it, one must first establish it;
To seize it, one must first grant it.
This is called subtle illumination.
The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
Fish must not leave the depths;
The state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**
The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone.
If lords and kings can hold to it,
The ten thousand things will transform of themselves.
When transformation stirs and desire arises,
I will press it down with the nameless uncarved block.
The nameless uncarved block—
It too will be free of desire.
Without desire, through stillness,
All under heaven will right itself.

**Laozi’s Virtue Classic**
*Tang Dynasty Yizhou Longxing Temple Stele of the Daodejing*

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**
Highest virtue does not act as virtue,
And so possesses virtue.
Lesser virtue does not lose virtue,
And so lacks virtue.
Highest virtue takes no action and has no purpose;
Lesser virtue takes no action yet has purpose.
Highest benevolence acts yet has no purpose;
Highest righteousness acts yet has purpose.
Highest propriety acts, and when none respond,
It rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of disorder.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao,
And the beginning of folly.
Therefore the great person dwells in the substantial, not the superficial,
In the fruit, not the flower.
Thus they discard that and take this.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became stable;
The spirits attained the One and became numinous;
The valleys attained the One and became full;
The ten thousand things attained the One and came to life;
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.
If heaven were not clear, it would fear splitting;
If earth were not stable, it would fear erupting;

Spirits without the numinous will fear dissipation;
Valleys without fullness will fear exhaustion;
The ten thousand things without life will fear annihilation;
Lords and kings without steadfast virtue will fear collapse.
Thus the noble takes the lowly as its root,
The high takes the low as its foundation.
Therefore lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," "the unworthy"—
Is this not taking the lowly as their root?

Hence, when carriages are counted, there are no carriages.
Not desiring to gleam like jade,
Nor to clatter like stone.

**Chapter Forty**
Reversion is the movement of the Dao,
Weakness is the function of the Dao.
The ten thousand things under heaven are born of being,
Being is born of non-being.

**Chapter Forty-One**
When the highest scholar hears of the Dao, they diligently practice it;
When the middling scholar hears of the Dao, they hold it as if it exists, as if it does not;
When the lowest scholar hears of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.
If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.
Thus the established sayings have it:
The luminous Dao seems obscure,
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat,
The level Dao seems uneven,
Supreme virtue seems like a valley,
Great purity seems sullied,
Abundant virtue seems insufficient,
Established virtue seems lax,
True substance seems mutable,
The great square has no corners,
The great vessel is late in completion,
The great sound is scarce of voice,
The great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Only the Dao is good at bestowing and good at completing.

**Chapter Forty-Two**
The Dao gives birth to the One,
The One gives birth to the Two,
The Two give birth to the Three,
The Three give birth to the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang,
Blending their qi to attain harmony.
What people despise are "the orphaned," "the widowed," "the unworthy,"
Yet kings and dukes use these as their titles.
Thus things may be diminished yet increased,
Or increased yet diminished.
What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not meet a natural death"—
I will take this as the father of my teaching.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.
Non-being enters where there is no space.
Thus I know the benefit of non-action.
Teaching without words,
Benefit without action—
Few under heaven attain these.

**Chapter Forty-Four**
Fame or self—which is dearer?
Self or wealth—which is greater?
Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
Thus excessive love incurs great cost,
Abundant hoarding incurs heavy loss.
Know contentment and you will not be disgraced,
Know when to stop and you will not be imperiled—
Thus you may endure long.

**Chapter Forty-Five**
Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible;
Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless.
Great straightness seems bent,
Great skill seems clumsy,
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Movement overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and stillness set the standard for all under heaven.

**Chapter Forty-Six**
When the world follows the Dao,
Warhorses are retired to fertilize fields;
When the world loses the Dao,
Military horses breed in the suburbs.
No crime is greater than indulging desire,
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment,
No fault is greater than covetousness.
Thus the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
Without stepping outside, one knows all under heaven;
Without looking through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling,
Names without seeing,
Accomplishes without acting.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
In the pursuit of learning, one gains daily;
In the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.
Losing and yet again losing,
One reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To govern all under heaven, one must always act without interference;
When there is interference, it is no longer sufficient to govern all under heaven.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
The sage has no fixed mind,
Taking the people’s mind as their own.
The good I treat as good,
The not-good I also treat as good—thus attaining goodness.
The trustworthy I trust,
The untrustworthy I also trust—thus attaining trust.
The sage in the world is cautious,
For the world, they harmonize their mind.
The people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,
And the sage treats them all like children.

**Chapter Fifty**
Emerging into life, entering into death.
Of those who follow life, three in ten;
Of those who follow death, three in ten;
Of those who move toward the realm of death, three in ten.
Why is this so?
Because of the thickness of their life-nurturing.
It is said that those who are good at preserving life
Do not meet rhinoceroses or tigers on land,
Nor are they struck by weapons in battle.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger has no place to sink its claws,
Weapons have no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this so?
Because there is no realm of death in them.

I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life
Do not encounter tigers or rhinoceroses when traveling on land,
Nor are they struck by armor or weapons when entering battle.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger has no place to sink its claws,
Weapons have no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this so?
Because there is no realm of death in them.

**Chapter Fifty-One**
The Dao gives them life,
Virtue nourishes them,
Things shape them,
Circumstances complete them.
Thus the myriad things all revere the Dao and honor virtue.
The Dao is revered, virtue is honored—
Yet none commands this, for it is always so of itself.
Therefore the Dao gives them life,
Virtue nourishes them,
Rears them, cultivates them,
Matures them, ripens them,
Sustains them, shelters them.
It gives life yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Leads yet does not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
The world has a beginning,
Which is the mother of the world.
Once you know the mother,
You also know the child.
Once you know the child,
Return to guard the mother.
Thus you will not perish to the end of your days.
Block the openings, shut the gates,
And to the end of your days you will not toil.
Open the openings, meddle in affairs,
And to the end of your days you will not be saved.
Seeing the small is called clarity,
Guarding the soft is called strength.
Use its light,
Return to its clarity,
And you will leave no misfortune for yourself—
This is called practicing the constant.

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
If I had but a little knowledge,
I would walk the great Dao,
Fearing only to stray.
The great Dao is smooth,
Yet people prefer byways.
The court is well swept,
The fields are overgrown,
The granaries are empty,
Yet they wear embroidered robes,
Carry sharp swords,
Surfeit themselves with food and drink,
And hoard excess wealth—
This is called the boast of thieves.
How far is this from the Dao!

The well-established cannot be uprooted,
The well-embracing cannot be loosed—
Thus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.
Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds;
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.
Therefore:
Observe the self through the self,
Observe the family through the family,
Observe the village through the village,
Observe the state through the state,
Observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is so?
By this.

**Chapter Fifty-Five**
One whose virtue is deeply rooted
Is like a newborn babe:
Poisonous insects do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Birds of prey do not strike.
Though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.
Not knowing the union of female and male, the organ stirs—
Such is the perfection of essence.
Crying all day without hoarseness—
Such is the perfection of harmony.
To know harmony is called the constant,
To know the constant is called clarity.
To augment life is called ill-omened,
To let the mind command the qi is called force.
When things reach their prime, they age—
This is called not-Dao.
Not-Dao perishes early.

**Chapter Fifty-Six**
Those who know do not speak,
Those who speak do not know.
Block the openings, shut the gates,
Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,
Soften the glare, merge with the dust—
This is called profound sameness.
Thus:
It cannot be made close,
Nor can it be made distant;
It cannot be benefited,
Nor can it be harmed;
It cannot be exalted,
Nor can it be debased.
Therefore, it is honored by the world.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven**
Govern the state with uprightness,
Deploy troops with craft,
Win the world through non-interference.
How do I know this is so?
By this.

The world abounds with taboos,
And the people grow ever poorer;
The people wield many sharp tools,
And the state sinks deeper into chaos;
The people cultivate many skills and arts,
And strange things proliferate;
Laws and regulations grow ever more prominent,
And thieves and bandits multiply.
Thus the sage declares:
“I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves;
I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;
I engage in no affairs, and the people prosper of themselves;
I harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.”

**Chapter Fifty-Eight**
When governance is dull and unrefined,
The people are honest and sincere;
When governance is sharp and exacting,
The people are lacking and flawed.
Misfortune—fortune leans upon it;
Fortune—misfortune lurks within it.
Who knows their ultimate end?
There is no fixed standard.
The upright reverts to the strange,
The good reverts to the ominous.
The people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.
Thus the sage is square but does not cut,
Has edges but does not harm,
Is straight but not overbearing,
Is bright but does not dazzle.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine**
In governing people and serving Heaven,
Nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one attain early compliance—
Early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue.
With repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome;
Having nothing one cannot overcome, none can know one’s limits.
With no known limits, one can possess the state.
Possessing the mother of the state,
One can endure long.
This is called the Dao of deep roots, firm foundation,
Long life, and enduring vision.

**Chapter Sixty**
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When the Dao presides over the world,
Its ghosts lose their numinosity.
Not that its ghosts lose their numinosity,
But their numinosity does no harm to people.
Not that their numinosity does no harm,
But the sage also does no harm.
As neither harms the other,
Virtue converges in them.

**Chapter Sixty-One**
A great state is the lower reaches,
The confluence of the world,
The female of the world.
The male constantly overcomes the female through stillness,
Using stillness as the lower position.
Thus a great state, by lowering itself before a small state,
Wins over the small state;
A small state, by lowering itself before a great state,
Wins over the great state.
Thus some lower themselves to win,
Others lower themselves and win.
A great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;
A small state desires nothing more than to enter into the service of others.
When both attain what they desire,
The greater must be the one to lower itself.

**Chapter Sixty-Two**
The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things.
It is the treasure of the good,
The refuge of the not-good.
Fine words can purchase honor,
Noble deeds can elevate a person.
Even if a person is not good,
Why should they be cast aside?
Thus, when establishing the Son of Heaven
Or appointing the Three Ministers,
Though one may offer large jade disks followed by teams of four horses,
It is better to sit and present this Dao.
Why did the ancients value this Dao?
Did they not say:
“Seek, and you shall obtain;
Have faults, and you shall be spared”?
Therefore, it is honored by the world.

**Chapter Sixty-Three**
Act through non-action,
Attend to no-affairs,
Taste the tasteless.
Whether great or small, many or few,
Repay resentment with virtue.
Resolve difficulties while they are easy,
Achieve greatness in small matters.
The difficult affairs of the world
Must begin with what is easy;
The great affairs of the world
Must begin with what is small.
Thus the sage never strives for greatness,
And thereby achieves greatness.
One who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted;
One who takes things lightly incurs many difficulties.
Thus the sage treats things as difficult,
And therefore never encounters difficulty.

**Chapter Sixty-Four**
What is at rest is easy to hold,
What has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for,
What is fragile is easy to break,
What is minute is easy to scatter.
Act before things exist,
Govern before disorder arises.
A tree as wide as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny shoot;
A terrace of nine layers rises from a basket of earth;
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Those who act will fail,
Those who grasp will lose.
Thus the sage practices non-action and does not fail,
Holds nothing and does not lose.
In their undertakings,
People often fail when near completion.
Be as careful at the end as at the beginning,
And there will be no failures.
Thus the sage desires what others do not desire,
Does not value rare goods;
Learns what others do not learn,
And returns from where the multitude has erred.
Thus they assist the self-so of the myriad things
And dare not act.

**Chapter Sixty-Five**
The ancients who were skilled in the Dao
Did not use it to enlighten the people,
But to make them simple.
The people are difficult to govern
Because they are too clever.
Thus to govern the state with cleverness
Is the state’s ruin;
Not to govern the state with cleverness
Is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two is also a model.
Always knowing this model
Is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching,
Opposed to things, yet ultimately in great accord.

**Chapter Sixty-Six**
The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
Is that they excel at lying low.
Thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,
They must speak as though below them;
If they wish to lead the people,
They must place themselves behind.
Thus the sage dwells above, yet the people do not feel burdened;
Dwells in front, yet the people do not feel harmed.
Thus the world delights in supporting them and does not tire.
Because they do not contend,
No one in the world can contend with them.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven**
The world all says I am great, unlike others.
It is precisely because I am great that I am unlike others.
If I were like others, I would long since have been small!
I possess three treasures that I hold and cherish:
The first is compassion,
The second is frugality,
The third is not daring to be first in the world.
Compassionate, thus able to be courageous;
Frugal, thus able to be expansive;
Not daring to be first in the world,
Thus able to become the chief of all vessels.
Now, to abandon compassion yet claim courage,
Abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness,
Abandon the last yet claim the first—
This is death.
Compassion—
In battle, it brings victory;
In defense, it brings solidity.
Heaven will save them,
And protect them with compassion.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight**
The ancients who were skilled as warriors were not martial,
Those skilled in battle were not enraged,
Those who excelled in defeating enemies did not contend,
Those who excelled in employing others placed themselves below.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
The use of others’ strength,
The matching of Heaven’s ancient standard.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine**
In the use of arms, there is a saying:
“I dare not be the host but act as the guest,
Dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.”
This is called marching without marching,
Raising arms without arms,
Grasping without weapons,
Confronting without enemies.
No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;
Underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.
Thus when evenly matched armies clash,
The side that grieves will win.

**Chapter Seventy**
My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.

The world knows not, nor can it practice.
Words have their source, affairs have their lord.
Only through ignorance do they not know me.
Those who know me are rare, thus I am precious.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.

**Chapter Seventy-One**
To know yet think one does not know is superior;
Not to know yet think one knows is a flaw.
Therefore the sage is not flawed.
Because he takes the flaw as a flaw,
He is thus without flaw.

**Chapter Seventy-Two**
When the people do not fear authority,
Greater authority will come.
Do not constrict their dwelling,
Do not oppress their livelihood.
Only by not oppressing them will they not be oppressed.
Therefore the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Thus he discards that and takes this.

**Chapter Seventy-Three**
Bold in daring, one is killed;
Bold in not daring, one lives.
Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.
What Heaven detests—who knows the reason?
The Way of Heaven:
Excels in victory without contention,
Responds well without speech,
Comes of itself without summons,
Is unhurried yet excels in planning.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
Sparse yet nothing slips through.

**Chapter Seventy-Four**
If the people do not fear death,
How can death be used to frighten them?
If one could make them constantly fear death,
And those who act strangely were seized and killed,
Who would dare?
There is always an executioner who kills.
To kill in place of the executioner
Is like hewing in place of the master carpenter.
Few who hew in place of the master carpenter
Do not injure their own hands.

**Chapter Seventy-Five**
The people’s hunger
Comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—
Thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed
Comes from their superiors’ meddling—
Thus they are difficult to govern.
The people’s disregard for death
Comes from their pursuit of excessive life—
Thus they disregard death.
Only those who do not strive for life
Are wiser than those who value life.

**Chapter Seventy-Six**
In life, humans are soft and weak;
In death, they are stiff and strong.
All things, plants and trees—
In life, they are soft and fragile;
In death, they are withered and dry.
Thus the stiff and strong are companions of death,
The soft and weak are companions of life.
Therefore when armies are strong, they do not prevail;
When trees are strong, they are felled.
Thus the strong and stiff dwell below,
The soft and weak dwell above.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven**
The Way of Heaven—
Is it not like drawing a bow?
The high is pressed down, the low is raised,
The excessive is reduced, the deficient is supplemented.
The Way of Heaven:
Reduces the excessive to supplement the deficient.
The way of humans is not so—
It reduces the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who can have excess to offer the world?
Only those with the Dao.
Therefore the sage acts but does not rely,
Achieves success but does not dwell in it,
And thus does not display his worth.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
Yet in attacking the hard and strong,
Nothing surpasses it.
Nothing can take its place.
Thus the weak overcomes the strong,
The soft overcomes the hard—
Yet none in the world know this,
None can practice it.
Therefore the sage says:
“One who bears the nation’s disgrace
Is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;
One who bears the nation’s misfortune
Is called the king of all under Heaven.”
True words seem paradoxical.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine**

To reconcile great resentment,
There must remain lingering resentment—
How can this be called good?
Therefore the sage holds the left tally
Yet does not demand from others.
Thus those with virtue oversee the tally,
Those without virtue oversee exactions.
The Way of Heaven shows no partiality,
Yet it ever bestows on the good.

**Chapter Eighty**
Let the state be small, its people few,
So that though there be tools for tens and hundreds,
They are not used.
Let the people regard death as weighty
And not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
None ride in them;
Though there be armor and weapons,
None array them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for use.
Sweet be their food,
Fair their clothing,
Secure their dwellings,
Joyful their customs.
Neighboring states may be within sight,
The sounds of their chickens and dogs heard,
Yet the people grow old and die
Without ever visiting one another.

**Chapter Eighty-One**
Truthful words are not fine,
Fine words are not truthful.
The good do not dispute,
The disputatious are not good.
The wise are not broadly learned,
The broadly learned are not wise.
The sage does not accumulate—
The more he does for others, the more he has;
The more he gives to others, the more he possesses.
The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm.
The Way of the sage acts and does not contend.
