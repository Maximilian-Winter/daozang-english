**Preface to the *Four Hundred Characters on Golden Elixir* with Annotations by Lü Xīxīng**
*Composed by Zhang Zǐyáng Zhēnrén of Song Tiāntái, Annotated by Lü Xīxīng of the Ming*

The **Seven Refunds and Nine Returns Golden Elixir**—seven denotes the number of fire, nine the number of metal.
To refine metal with fire, returning to the origin and restoring the essence, is called **Golden Elixir**.
Divide the body and mind into upper and lower strings,
Distinguish the spirit-*qi* at the winter and summer solstices,
Align the form and spirit with the **Kàn-Lí** (water-fire) hexagrams.
Gather the five phases:
East—**arcanum** (hún, soul) of wood,
West—**pò** (corporeal essence) of metal,
South—**shén** (spirit) of fire,
North—**jīng** (essence) of water,
Center—**yì** (intent) of earth.
Thus, the five phases converge.

To **contain the luminous gaze**, **condense the resonant breath**,
**harmonize the nasal breath**, **seal the tongue’s *qi***—
this is the **unification of the four symbols**.

When the eyes do not see yet the *arcanum* abides in the liver,
When the ears do not hear yet the essence resides in the kidneys,
When the tongue does not speak yet the spirit dwells in the heart,
When the nose does not scent yet the *pò* lingers in the lungs,
When the limbs do not move yet the intent rests in the spleen—
this is called **Five *Qi* Returning to the Primordial**.

Refine essence into *qi*,
Refine *qi* into spirit,
Refine spirit into the **Void**—
thus it is called **Three Flowers Converging at the Crown**.

When the *arcanum* is in the liver yet does not leak through the eyes,
When the *pò* is in the lungs yet does not leak through the nose,
When the spirit is in the heart yet does not leak through the mouth,
When the essence is in the kidneys yet does not leak through the ears,
When the intent is in the spleen yet does not leak through the orifices—
this is called **Leakless**.

Essence, spirit, *arcanum*, *pò*, and intent
intermingle and coalesce into one *qi*,
Invisible, inaudible, nameless—
thus it is called **Primordial Void**.

Refining essence means refining **Primordial Essence**—
not the lustful essence from carnal indulgence.
Refining *qi* means refining **Primordial *Qi***—
not the breath inhaled through mouth and nose.
Refining spirit means refining **Primordial Spirit**—
not the mental projections of heart and mind.
Thus, this **spirit, *qi*, and essence**
share the same root as Heaven and Earth,
the same body as all things.
Obtain them and live; lose them and die.

Refine with **yang fire**, and it becomes **yang *qi**;
Nourish with **yin符 (talisman)**, and it becomes **yin essence**.
Thus it is said:
*Perceived, it cannot be used;
Used, it cannot be perceived.*

The body is the **dwelling of the heart**;
The heart is the **sovereign of the body**.
When the heart rages like a dragon,
The body becomes fierce as a tiger.
Within the body lies a point of **true yang *qi***;
Within the heart lies a point of **true yin essence**.
Thus it is called **Two Substances**.

The heart belongs to **Kàn (water)**;
The body belongs to **Kūn (earth)**—
thus it is called the **Kàn-Kūn Cauldron**.

**Yang *qi*** belongs to **Lí (fire)**;
**Yin essence** belongs to **Kàn (water)**—
thus it is called **Wu-Tù (Tortoise-Hare) Medicine**.

Embrace the One, guard the Center,
Refine the Primordial, nourish the Substantial—
thus it is called **Harvesting the Primordial Mixed-Essence *Qi***.

Morning **Zhèn (thunder, ☳)**, evening **Méng (darkness, ☴)**,
Noon **Dù (midday, ☲)**, midnight **Zǐ (child, ☉)**—
thus it is called **Circulating the Fire of the Heavenly Cycle**.

Wood’s **liquid** thrives at **Mǎo (3–5 AM)**,
Metal’s **essence** thrives at **Yǒu (5–7 PM)**—
thus one must **bathe**.

**Zhèn (thunder, ☳)**-male drinks **west wine**,
**Duì (lake, ☱)**-female plucks **north blossoms**,
**Xùn (wind, ☴)**-wind stirs the six yangs,
**Kūn (earth, ☷)**-soil conceals the seven numbers—
thus one must **draw and supplement**.

At the onset of gathering medicine,
One moves the **Kàn-Kūn (water-earth) latchkey**,
Extracts the **Kàn-Lí (water-fire) blade and pill**.
Initially, like clouds filling a thousand peaks,
Then like the moon embracing ten thousand waters—
naturally like the **tortoise and serpent’s union**,
Like the **ox and horse’s pacing**.

The **Dragon contends for the *arcanum***,
The **Tiger contends for the *pò***,
The **Crow battles for essence**,
The **Hare battles for spirit**—
In the **dim haze**, true **lead** appears;
In the **obscure void**, true **mercury** emerges.

With **Yellow Nurse** as matchmaker,
Guarded in the **Central Palace**.
Lead meets fire and **ascends**,
Mercury meets fire and **flees**.
Thus, with **Non-Being as oil**, it is blended,
And with **Nameless Crude**, it is **settled**.
Lead returns to the **Kūn Palace**,
Mercury returns to the **Kàn Position**—
True earth merges, **luminous and silent**.

Excessive fire causes **dryness**,
Excessive water causes **overflow**—
Dryness and overflow must be **regulated**,
Hence the **scales and measures**.

At this stage of cultivation:
The **cinnabar field** generates wind,
The **vermilion palace** shines with moon,
The **elixir field** blazes with fire,
The **grain sea** ripples clear,
The **spine’s groove** resembles a chariot wheel,
The limbs become like mountains,
The pores open as after bathing,
The bones and vessels relax as in deep sleep,
The spirit unites like husband and wife,
The *arcanum* and *pò* cling like mother and child—
This is the **true realm**, not metaphor.

Refine with **scales and measures**,
And it **congeals without dispersing**.
Refine with **weights and balances**,
And it **coalesces ever firmer**.
The *arcanum* is hidden, the *pò* is extinguished,
Essence condenses, spirit solidifies—
One intent harmonizes, the flesh becomes **luminous and transparent**.
Day by day, hour by hour,
It **gradually congeals and gathers**,
From **formlessness to form**,
Structuring the **Sacred Embryo**.

A year has **twelve months**,
A month has **thirty days**,
A day has **one hundred *kè* (quarter-hours)**.
A month totals **three thousand *kè***,
Ten months total **thirty thousand *kè***.
In **sitting, standing, walking, resting**,
It persists **unbroken**.

Once the **embryonic *qi*** congeals,
The **infant form** manifests,
The **dark pearl** takes shape,
**Taiyi** embraces the **True**.
Within **thirty thousand *kè***,
One can **seize the thirty thousand years** of Heaven.
How so?
Each *kè* contains a **year’s seasonal shifts**.
Thus, **thirty thousand *kè*** can **seize thirty thousand years**.
Hence, a year’s **twelve months** total **thirty-six thousand**.

Even the **foolish commoner**, practicing this,
Instantly ascends to the **Sacred Realm**.
Yet the masses, in their daily lives,
Unknowingly **lose their Primordial Essence**,
**exhaust their Primordial *Qi***,
**sever their Primordial Spirit**.
Thus, every *kè* must be **harmonized**.
If even one *kè* is amiss,
The **medicinal materials decay**,
The **fire’s timing falters**.
Thus it is said:
*A hair’s breadth of deviation—no elixir is made.*
Therefore, one must **attend to each *kè***,
Yet do so **without effort**.

True *qi* congeals, the Primordial Spirit expands.
Internally, one refines **thirty thousand *kè*** of elixir in a year;
Externally, one **seizes thirty thousand years**.
On a grand scale, one **forms a fetus** of **thirteen thousand five hundred breaths** in a day;
On a small scale, one **circulates eighty-four thousand *lǐ*** in twelve *shí* (two-hour periods).

「Therefore, it is said: **Seize the Yang** of a single point from Heaven and Earth,
And **harvest the Qi** of the two wheels of Sun and Moon.

**Circulate the True Water** in the Lead Furnace,
And **move the True Fire** in the Mercury Tripod.

When Lead encounters Mercury,
It is called the **Flowering Pool**.
When Mercury enters Lead,
It is called **Divine Water**.

One must not **cling to inaction**,
Nor **manifest in overt action**,
Nor **fixate on visualization**,
Nor **obsessionally adhere to retention**,
Nor **sit in vain and lose resolve**,
Nor **practice blindly and refine recklessly**.

**True Earth subdues True Lead**,
And **True Lead restrains True Mercury**.
When Lead and Mercury **return to True Earth**,
The body and mind **become still and unmoved**.

The Dao of the Golden Elixir
Has no other principle than Lead, Mercury, and Earth—
Lead is the **True Water of Metal**,
Mercury is the **True Fire of Wood**.

The methods of the Elixir **reverse the Five Phases** to achieve wondrous effects,
Thus, Earth **subdues Lead**,
And Lead **restrains Mercury**,
**Devouring and being devoured**,
All **die and return to the thick Earth**,
And only then does the Golden Elixir **begin to take form**.

**True Earth** refers to the **Earth of the Self**.
The Master of Upper Yang said:
*"To **subdue Water** and seek Lead with the **Earth of the Self**—this is correct.
For the **Qi of True Lead** is concealed within the **Gate of the Twenty-Eight**,
And I **ride its movement** to take it.
If there is no **Earth of the Self**,
Then the **resonance and response** will be misaligned,
And the **medicinal material** will never be obtained.*

The **true adept** must **discern and extract the True Mind** here.
When the **True Mind** issues forth a **True Intent**,
**Twisting and probing** it,
**Searching and refining** it,
**Nurturing it with gentleness**,
This is the **pith and marrow**—
As the *Paramartha Contract* says:
*"**Embrace the subtle and profound**,
**Unfold and reveal the treasure**."*

This is the **essential key** to seeking Lead.

Yet, when it is called **True**,
It is taken in the sense of **unadulterated and pure**.
If Lead is **True Lead** but Earth is not **True Earth**,
Then **True cannot contain True**,
And **impurity cannot align with the Dao**.

When the **medicinal material is obtained** and **returned to the Tripod**,
It is the **Mercury of my own Yin**,
Naturally **subdued and controlled**,
**Summoning Lead** yet **neither scattering nor fleeing**—
For what reason?
Fire is extinguished by Water,
Wood is subdued by Metal—
These are the **natural ways** of no great wonder.

The *Paramartha Contract* states:
*"When Water is excessive, Fire is extinguished—annihilation.
All return to the thick Earth."*

The **wondrous interplay of the Five Phases** is such:
Water meets Earth and is **smothered**,
Fire meets Earth and is **concealed**.
All things **cannot be born without Earth**,
Thus the Elixir method **culminates in returning to Earth**.

**Nourishing the Holy Fetus**,
**Perfecting the Elixir**,
Has no other path than this.
Yet when **returning to Earth**,
The body and mind **both become still and unmoved**—
For the **body and mind** are the **two strings** of **Yin and Yang Qi**,
As the *Canon* says:
*"Divide the body and mind into upper and lower,
The two strings are the Dao of the Golden Elixir—
**Movement** is its **function**,
**Stillness** is its **substance**.
When **still and unmoved**, it is **stillness**—
Thus, from here onward, the **mysteries of returning to stillness** are spoken of."*

**Emptiness and Nothingness** generate **White Snow**,
**Stillness and Quietude** sprout **Yellow Sprouts**.
The **Jade Furnace** warms with **gentle Fire**,
The **Golden Tripod** ascends **Purple Mist**.

**Emptiness and stillness**—
The **peak of immobility**—
**"White Snow"** and **"Yellow Sprouts"** are both **alternate names for the Elixir**.
For **"White Snow"** is the **essence of Yin**,
And **"Yellow Sprouts"** are the **emerging vitality of Lead**,
As the *Paramartha Contract* says:
*"Yin Fire is white,
Yellow Sprouts are Lead."*

When the body and mind are **still and unmoved**,
The Elixir resides in the **Central Palace**,
And only **harmonious Qi** of spring warmth is seen—
**Vitality and movement** flourish abundantly,
Like **White Snow** drifting in the **void**,
Like **Yellow Sprouts** bursting from the **soil**.
At this time, the **refinement of Fire** must not be too **dry**,
But should **nurture it gently**,
And **preserve it softly**.

As our **Holy Master** spoke:
*"The Elixir furnace of the River East rests in **tranquility**,
The **Fetus of the Crane** and the **Breath of the Tortoise** naturally **soften**."*

As for the **mists ascending the Tripod**,
It is the **Yang Light striking the crown**—
A metaphor for **external Elixir** using the **furnace’s fire**,
Easily understood.

**Flowering Pool blooms the Lotus**,
**Divine Water** stirs **Golden Waves**.
The night is deep, the moon is bright and clear—
**Heaven and Earth** as a **single wheel of mirror**.

**Flowering Pool** and **Divine Water** have many interpretations.
An ancient verse says:
*"The **foundation of life** lies only in the **Golden Flowering Pool**."*
Now, applying the words of **enlightenment**,
**"Flowering Pool blooms the Lotus"** refers to the **virgin maiden’s first bloom** in the **Northern Land**.
**"Divine Water"** is the **True Mercury of the Self**.
**"Golden Waves"**—
The **ultimate clarity of water and stillness**.

**"The night is deep, the moon is bright and clear"**—
At the **midnight hour**, the **moonlight shines** in the **Northern Sea**.
**"Deep night"** is the **juncture of Hài and Zǐ**,
The **time of the Winter Solstice**.
**"Heaven and Earth as a single wheel of mirror"**—
The **peak of luminous purity**.

For the **medicinal material** must first **be rich in Qi** before it is **born**,
And **still and settled** before it is **harvested**.
When the **Metal Essence is robust and flourishing**,
And the **Moon’s Radiance** is **clear and pure**,
The **Golden Lotus** half-unfolds,
The **Elixir Sprout** is fresh and new.
To **harvest it at this moment**,
One must **guard it with serenity**,
And **prioritize it with non-contention**—
This is called **clear water and pure waves**,
And only then can it **reflect all phenomena**,
And the **Pearl of the Tortoise** be obtained.

Otherwise, if there is **disturbance within**,
The **essence will scatter**,
And **calamity, regret, and remorse** will arise from it,
And the **medicinal material** will never be obtained.

**Cinnabar refines the Yang Qi**,
**Quick-silver cooks the Metal Essence**.
The **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi**—
**Cinnabar** and **Quick-silver**—
Are both **alternate names for the Elixir**.
When speaking of **"Cinnabar"**, it is the **Yang Qi** being refined.
When speaking of **"Quick-silver"**, it is the **Metal Essence** being cooked.
For the Elixir **relies on Fire** to transform,
Thus, in the **twelve double-hours**,
When **Yang Fire** refines it,
It becomes **Yang Qi**.
And **"Cinnabar"** is where the **Yang Qi** **congeals**.
When **Yin Symbols** nurture it,
It becomes **Yin Essence**.
And **"Quick-silver"** is where the **Yin Essence** **forms**.
Yet the **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi** are **one and the same**.

Thus, it is summarized:
*"The **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi**—
**Cinnabar** and **Quick-silver**."*

Now it is known:
**One substance in two forms**,
Which cannot be **clearly divided** into two—
Only **according to the Fire and Symbols** does it **shift**.

The sequence states:
*"When refined by Yang Fire, it becomes Yang Qi;
When nurtured by Yin Symbols, it becomes Yin Essence."*
This is its intent.

◎ The **Sun’s soul** is the **fat of the Jade Rabbit**,
The **Moon’s shadow** is the **marrow of the Golden Crow**.
When gathered into the **Cauldron**, they merge as **one pool of water**.
For the **precise essences of Yin and Yang** intermingle within,
Thus it is said: *"The soul"*—the **essence of the Great Yang**—
Is the **fat of the Jade Rabbit**, the **central line of Kan**,
Which is **true lead**.

The **Moon’s shadow**—the **substance of Great Yin**—
Is the **marrow of the Golden Crow**, the **central line of Li**,
Which is **true mercury**.

Thus, the **two medicines of Crow and Rabbit**,
When gathered into the **Cauldron**, dissolve into **water**,
And become the **Golden Elixir**.
As the *Paramartha Agreement* says:
*"Dissolving into water, the horse-tooth lapis."*

Indeed, the **medicine’s origin** knows no greater than **one breath ascending from the steamer-mountain**,
Then transforming into **water**—first as **liquid**, then congealing—
And thus the **Returning Elixir** is complete.
All texts speak of **Jade Nectar and Sweet Dew**,
**Bathing the Crown with Curdled Milk**—
None exceed this.

◎ The **medicine’s birth** lies in the **Mysterious Aperture**,
The **fire’s timing** ignites the **Yang Furnace**.
When **Dragon and Tiger** cease their union,
The **Treasure Cauldron** births the **Mysterious Pearl**.

As above, the **medicine and fire’s timing** have been clearly expounded.
The **Immortal Sage** feared others might not grasp their **interaction**,
Thus further revealing this **one aperture**.
Its meaning is already seen in the sequence:

*"Within the body, there is one aperture called the **Mysterious Female**—
Not the heart, not the kidneys,
Not the mouth or nose,
Not the spleen or stomach,
Not the anal passage or bladder,
Nor the **Elixir Field** or **Mud Ball**.
To know this **one aperture** is to know the **Winter Solstice** within,
The **medicine** within,
The **fire’s timing** within,
The **bathing** within,
The **gestation** within,
The **shedding of the body** within.

This **one aperture** has no boundaries, no inside or outside—
It is the **root of spirit-qi** and the **valley of emptiness**.
Thus, seeking it within the body,
One must not seek it elsewhere."*

Such instruction is concise yet exhaustive.

◎ This **aperture** is no ordinary one—
It is the **union of Heaven and Earth**, formed together.
Named the **Spirit-Qi Cavity**,
Within it dwell the **essences of Kan and Li**.

*"Someone asks: What are the **medicines**?
The **medicine** is the **true Yin-Yi qi of Kan**—**true lead**.
The **substance** is the **long-accumulated essence of Li**—**true mercury**."*

The *Dao De Jing* says:
*"Faint and indistinct, yet within it lies the **substance**."*
This refers to the **substance**.

*"Dark and obscure, yet within it lies the **essence**.
Its essence is most true, within it lies the **verity**."*
This refers to the **medicine**.

The **medicine and substance** arise from the **dark and indistinct**,
Yet it is said they arise from the **Mysterious Aperture**—
For the **dwellings of Yin and Yang** hold their **true essences** intermingled.
At this time, **Dragon and Tiger** have not yet united,
The **Mysterious Female** has not yet formed.
Thus, they still belong to **two families**.
Once gathered in one place,
The **spirit-qi** naturally returns to its **root**,
And within the **void**, this **one aperture**—the **Mysterious Female**—emerges.
Within it, the **medicine and substance** grow daily and monthly,
Until at **three hundred cycles**, the **transformation is complete**—
**gestation, shedding the body, divine metamorphosis**—
All stem from this.
Thus it is said: *"Gestation is here, shedding the body is here."*

When asked why the **fire’s timing** and **Winter Solstice** are within,
It is said: *"The **fire’s timing** is the **circuit of Heaven’s numbers**,
The **surrounding revolutions** are all within this place.
The **Winter Solstice** is here—from **obscurity to dawn**,
When **Thunder arrives to receive the Symbols**,
The **Yang Furnace** ignites—
All occur within this.
Yet this is not the **Winter Solstice** of others.
Thus it is said: *‘Seek it within the body, not elsewhere.’*
The **Immortal Sage’s words** carry deep meaning—
Saying *‘seek it within’* teaches one to **first recognize it in the body**,
Saying *‘not elsewhere’* shows that **seeking it elsewhere** is also possible at times."

◎ **One point of Wood Mercury** glows red,
**Four catties of Gold Lead** are black.
When **Lead and Mercury** coalesce into a **pearl**,
It shines **bright and wondrous—wisteria gold**.

**Wood Mercury** is the **spirit of the previous cycle’s mercury**,
With not even a **dram’s weight**, hence *"one point."*
The **Upper Yang Master** said:
*"Take a **nearby true mercury** to welcome it."*
**Gold Lead** is the **true Yin-Yi water of Kan**,
From which **gold is born in water**, hence *"day-gold lead."*
Speaking of **three catties** means **forty-eight taels**.
Each **tael of true lead** weighs **three chins**—
Totaling **one hundred forty-four chins**,
The **strategy number of Kun**.

For **Gold Lead’s** complete form remains unbroken,
Its **chins and taels** are whole—
Thus this count.
**Cinnabar** is another name for the **Returning Elixir’s Golden Liquid**.
**Wisteria** is the color of **red and black combined**.
The *Paramartha Agreement* says:
*"Its hue shifts to wisteria, then **brightly becomes the Returning Elixir**."*
**Bright and wondrous** is the same as *"brightly."*
The **Golden Elixir** is the **substance without substance**,
Not to be sought by **form or appearance**.
The **Immortal Sage**, through **prescriptions and symbols**, reverses the analogy to guide others—
The intent lies beyond the **words and meaning**.
If one insists on seeking the so-called *"bright wisteria gold"*
Before calling it **Elixir**, then such a person speaks in **dreams**,
Far from the truth.

◎ The **homestead’s scenery** is splendid,
**Spring rains** deepen as the **wind blows**.
Plowing and hoeing require **no effort**—
The **entire earth turns to gold**.

*"The **homestead**" refers to the **body within**.
*"Splendid scenery"* means the **medicine is complete**.
*"Spring rains"* and *"wind"* signify the **fire’s timing is sufficient**.

When the **medicine is gathered into the Cauldron**,
And one **embraces unity**, **abiding in the center**—
All must be **harmonized with the Oil of Non-Action**,
**Settled by the Nameless Pebble**—
Thus, though there is **plowing and hoeing**, no **labor is spent**.
When the **work is complete** and the **medicine transforms**,
The **entire earth becomes gold**.
The **earth** also refers to **the body**.
As when **blood turns to white grease**,
**Bones become jade and alabaster**,
**Yin is exhausted, Yang is pure**,
**Form and substance are altered**—
A **golden body of sixteen feet**,
**Unspoiled for ten thousand kalpas—**
How could this be empty words?

「One version reads *"not exhausting labor"* (不废力), meaning one does not neglect its work. Yet, considering the sense of *"using without strain"* (用之不勤) and *"difficult to exhaust with toil"* (难以愁劳), the reading *"not expending"* (不费) is superior.

◎ **True Lead (真铅)** is born in **Kan (坎)**, its use lies in the **Li Palace (离宫)**.
With black turning to red, a single cauldron’s **qi** becomes dense.
This refers to the **land where the medicine is produced** and the **place where it is used**.
**True Lead** born in **Kan** means **gold is produced from water**, and its use in the **Li Palace** is to subdue **Mercury (汞)**.
The **elixir method** uses black to invest red—at this moment, the **True Qi (真气)** ascends and descends, fusing the essence like **mist rising from mountains and lakes**.
Yet the *"initial dense clouds filling the thousand mountains"* (初时云满千山) in the sequence hints at this very stage.

◎ **True Mercury (真汞)** is produced in **Li (离)**, its use however returns to **Kan (坎)**.
A **lovely maiden (姹女)** passes through the **Southern Garden (南园)**, holding a **jade olive (玉橄榄)**.
**True Mercury** produced in **Li** means **fire generates the southern realm**, and its use in **Kan** is to seek **Lead (铅)**.
The **lovely maiden** is **Mercury**, the **Southern Garden** its native domain; *"passing through the Southern Garden"* means departing from its own southern realm.
Departing from the **Southern Garden**, traveling to the **western neighbor** (西邻), then **they contend and support each other**, and the **Dark Pearl (玄珠)** manifests its form.
**Jade olive (玉橄榄)** is another name for the **Dark Pearl**.
Olives are **bitter yet sweet**—taking this to illustrate is most clear and apt.

◎ **Zhen (震)** and **Dui (兑)** are neither east nor west,
**Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)** are neither south nor north.
The **Big Dipper’s handle (斗柄)** traverses the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,
Its essence lies in **human gathering and compression (攒簇)**.»

The **Zhen (震)** and **Dui (兑)**, **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**—these are the four **symbols (象)** of the **Dao (道)**.
East, west, south, north—these are the four **symbols'** positions (位)**.
When crafting the **elixir (丹)**, gather and compress the **Five Phases (五行)**, harmonize the four **symbols**, and return them to the **Central Palace (中宫)**, then east, west, south, and north blend into one.
Thus, **Metal (金)** does not dwell in the west,
**Wood (木)** does not dwell in the east,
**Fire (火)** does not dwell in the south,
**Water (水)** does not dwell in the north.
When neither **hexagram (卦)** nor **trigram (爻)** exists, nor their respective positions,
and one forgets form and obscures symbol,
it cannot be sought or questioned—
yet it is named the **elixir (丹)**.
But its essence lies in using the **Big Dipper’s handle (斗柄)** to traverse the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,
with **Fire’s conditions (火侯)** fully observed,
then the blending and compression may be achieved.

For the **Celestial Cycle (周天)** is governed by the **Big Dipper (北斗)**, which distributes the **original qi (元气)**.
As the **Celestial Cycle** revolves, the **Five Qi (五气)** flow in sequence, completing the year’s work.
Humans also possess this.
If one cannot *"observe the Dao of Heaven (观天之道), grasp Heaven’s movements (执天之行)"*,
and instead seeks the **human gathering and compression (攒簇)**—the **so-called Celestial Pivot (辰极)**—
how can one compress and blend to produce the **true elixir of immortality (真乙之丹)**?

◎ **Fire’s conditions (火侯)** do not require set times,
nor does the **winter solstice (冬至)** necessarily fall on **zi hour (子)**.
In the **bathing method (沐浴法)**, at **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)** hours, the **empty comparison (虚比)** occurs.
For the **elixir’s Fire’s conditions (金丹火侯)**,
the twelve hours from **zi (子)** onward are **yang (阳)**,
and the twelve hours from **wu (午)** onward are **yin (阴)**.
When **hai (亥)** and **zi (子)** hours meet,
one **yang** returns—this is called the **winter solstice (冬至)**.
In the months of **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)**,
**Wood (木)** and **Metal (金)** qi flourish,
and the **bathing method (沐浴)** should be applied.
At this point, the **principles of yin and yang (阴阳之定理)** and the **numbers of transformation (造化之成数)**
must not differ by even a hair’s breadth.
Yet though the **method (法)** is fixed,
the **principles (理)** are boundless and flexible—
its subtleties lie in the practitioner’s mind.
Thus, the **administration of medicines (入药)** and the **ignition of fire (起火)** have their own advances and retreats;
one need not adhere strictly to **zi (子)** and **wu (午)** hours.
When **Zhen (震)** arrives and receives its **talisman (符)**,
there is **true faith (真信)**—
not confined to the month of **zi (子)**.
When bathing in the **elixir’s Fire’s conditions (金丹)**,
at the proper time and season,
it is not confined to **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)** months.
The **medicine administration (入药)** states:
*"Within one day, twelve hours;
Where the mind reaches, all may be done."*
It also says:
*"At the initial embryo formation, examine one’s natal **command (本命)**;
At the final **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)**, observe the **four cardinal directions (四正)**."*
This fully elucidates the matter.

◎ **Crow’s liver (乌肝)** and **rabbit’s marrow (兔髓)**—
when seized, they are found in one place.
One **elixir grain (一粒)** follows another,
from the subtle to the manifest.
**Crow’s liver (乌肝)** and **rabbit’s marrow (兔髓)** are the **essence of Kan and Li (坎离之精)**;
they must be seized and returned to one place
before the **golden elixir (金丹)** can be formed.
When **Fire’s conditions (火)** traverse the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,
and the work is complete after **three hundred days (三百)**,
this is called **one grain per day (日复一粒)**—
from the subtle to the manifest.
The **embryo (婴儿)** reveals its form,
and the **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)** achieves **spiritual transformation (神化)**.

◎ **Chaos (混沌)** embraces the **void (虚空)**,
the **void** encompasses the **Three Realms (三界)**.
Yet when seeking its roots,
one finds a **grain of millet (黍米)** in size.
The **Three Realms (三界)**—the **Realm of Desire (欲界)**, the **Realm of Form (色界)**, and the **Realm of Formlessness (无色界)**—
all are contained within the **void (虚空)**,
and **Chaos (混沌)** embraces them.
**Chaos (混沌)** is the **preheaven undifferentiated (先天无极)**.
When the **elixir method (丹法)** returns the **spiritual qi (神气)** to its root,
the **void (虚无)** gives rise to **orifices (生窍)**,
and within the **formless (无质)** arises **sacred substance (灵质)**—
this is the **void** encompassing the **Three Realms**.
After **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)**,
all return to the **void (虚无)**,
to **Chaos (混沌)**,
and are then called **accomplished (了当)**—
this is **Chaos** embracing the **void**.
Yet when seeking the **foundation of one’s life (立命之根源)**,
it is still just a **grain-sized Dark Pearl (一黍玄珠)**,
from the subtle to the manifest.
For the **grain of millet (黍米)**,
it is the **having within the none (无中之有)**;
when **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)** achieves **spiritual transformation (神化)**,
it returns once more to the **none (无)**—
then the **sage (圣人)** is beyond knowing,
and the **Way (道)** is truly united.

◎ When **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** interact, **true fluid (真液)** emerges;
when **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)** contain **true essence (真精)**.
If one grasps the **foundation of Kan and Li (坎离基)**,
then the **Three Realms (三界)** return to one body.
**Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** are the **body of yin and yang’s union (阴阳配合之体)**,
while **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)** are the **essence of yin and yang’s mutual concealment (阴阳互藏之精)**.
When **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** interact,
the **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**’s essences merge—
**true essence (真精)** merges, then **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)**’s **true fluid (真液)** flows.
**Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)** are the **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**;
if humans grasp this to establish the **elixir’s foundation (丹基)**,
then the **cosmos lies within the hand (宇宙在乎手)**,
and **transformation arises from the body (万化生乎身)**—
thus the **Three Realms (三界)** return to one body.
The **Three Realms (三界)** are the **upper, middle, and lower (上中下)**,
all inherently possessed by the human body.
Using **essence (精)** achieves the **Realm of Desire (欲界)**,
using **qi (气)** achieves the **Realm of Form (色界)**,
using **spirit (神)** achieves the **Realm of Formlessness (无色界)**.

◎ The **Dragon (龙)** emerges from the **Eastern Sea (东海)**,
the **Tiger (虎)** rises from the **Western Mountain (西山)**.
The two beasts wage war in one battle,
transforming into **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)**.
Since the **medicines (药物)** belong to **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**,
what are the **Dragon (龙)** and **Tiger (虎)**?
The **elixir scriptures (丹书)** blend varied names and characters,
yet they originate from one source.
For **Kan (坎)**’s **Lead (铅)** is hard to obtain,
yet easy to **devour (咥)** humans—
thus it is symbolized by the **Tiger (虎)**;
**Li (离)**’s **Mercury (汞)** is fond of **fleeing (飞)**,
yet hard to **control (控御)**—
thus it is symbolized by the **Dragon (龙)**.
The **Dragon (龙)** comes from the **Eastern Sea (东海)**,
and then **subdues the Tiger (就虎)**;
The **Tiger (虎)** rises from the **Western Mountain (西山)**,
and then **follows the Dragon (超而从龙)**.
The **elixir method (丹法)** drives the **Dragon (龙)** to subdue the **Tiger (虎)**,
and harnesses the **Tiger (虎)** to follow the **Dragon (龙)**.
Thus these two beasts **devour and are devoured (相呑相啖)**,
clashing in the **pentagon (戊己之宫)**,
then blending and merging harmoniously—
transforming into **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)**,
and thus the **returned elixir (还丹)** may be achieved.
Indeed, **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)** is the **essence of Kan and Li (坎离之精)**—
how could there be two?

◎ The **golden flower (金花)** blooms on **Mercury’s (汞)** leaf,
the **jade embryo (玉蒂)** grows on **Lead’s (铅)** branch.
**Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)** never separate—
**Heaven (乾)** and **Earth (坤)** endure through time.
Grasses and trees hold flowers within their leaves,
while **embryos (蒂)** grow on branches above—
all are the **marvel of yin and yang’s mutual roots (阴阳互根)**,
**intertwining and binding (相纽相结)**.
Applied to the **elixir method (丹法)**,
the **golden flower (金华)** blooms on **Mercury’s (汞)** leaf—
**yin (阴)** containing **yang (阳)**, the **symbol of Kan’s Lead (坎铅)**.
The **jade embryo (玉蒂)** is the **embryo of the hexagram wuji (己之命蒂)**—
**Yin (鄞)** and **Yang (鄂)** are its names.
The **foundation of life (命基)** cannot stand alone;
it must obtain **true Lead (真铅)** to merge with **its own Mercury (己汞)**,
then **spiritual qi (神气)** intertwines and binds,
giving birth to the **sacred embryo (圣胎)**—
thus the **jade embryo (玉蒂)** grows on **Lead’s (铅)** branch.
This marvel of **yin and yang’s mutual roots (阴阳构精)**,
**intertwining and binding (相纽相结)**,
are all the **natural workings of transformation (造化之自然)**.
The **sage (圣人)** names them **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**,
to reveal their **mutually concealed essence (互藏之精)**,
and symbolizes them as **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**,
to capture their **intermingling brilliance (交光之妙)**.

Then the **Dao of the Elixir** becomes manifest,
and one observes the **Heaven and Earth** in their appointed places,
the **Sun and Moon** in their courses,
the **day and night** in their ceaseless cycles—
not a single breath’s pause exists,
yet the **Heaven and Earth** remain unbroken.
Thus is the **eternal day of ten thousand ages** realized.
Therefore, the **Heaven and Earth** of ten thousand ages
are the **Sun and Moon** of ten thousand ages;
the **Sun and Moon** of ten thousand ages
are the **Dao of the Elixir** of ten thousand ages.
Were the **Sun and Moon** to ever halt in their motion,
all things would cease to arise,
and the **Heaven and Earth** would nearly perish—
how then could the **Elixir Body** endure its eternal vitality?

Now, who speaks of the **eternal day of ten thousand ages**?
Some interpret the **moment’s work** within the sequence
as seizing the **measure of a year**—
this reasoning falls far short of the truth.

◎ **Bathing** to avert peril, **refining and supplementing** with utmost caution.
All depends on **three ten-thousand moments**—
a single misstep risks ruin by a hair’s breadth.
When the **Moon** aligns with **Mao-Wei** (卯酉),
and **Yin and Yang’s virtue** confronts the threshold,
the method demands **bathing**.
**Bathing** is precisely what averts peril.
For **bathing** encompasses two meanings:
First, in **Mao-Wei months**, **Wood and Metal qi** flourish;
adding **Fire** risks **flight and dispersion**.
Second, in **Mao-Wei months**, **Yin and Yang qi** balance;
adding **Fire** risks **imbalance and excess**.
Thus, **bathing** and **halting Fire** avert peril.
**Refining** means extracting **Lead**,
**supplementing** means adding **Mercury**.
**Utmost caution** means advancing and retreating,
ascending and descending—
all must conform to **Heaven’s measure**.
A single thought’s deviation invites **regret and calamity**,
and the **three ten-thousand moments’** labor will be lost.
**Three ten-thousand moments** span **ten months**.
The terms **refining** and **supplementing**—
many scholars fail to grasp them;
I have already expounded them in the *Play of Mystic Hide*.

◎ When **Yin and Yang** unite in copulation,
the **Cloud-Rain Chamber** stirs with passion.
A year’s gestation yields a child—
each child born astride a crane.
The **Dao of the Golden Elixir**:
if followed, it **perfects the Sage**;
if reversed, it **forges the Elixir**.
Thus, the **Old Immortal’s** final verse
illustrates the **Cloud-Rain Chamber’s** union—
a means to make it plain to all.
Yet it is not the **worldly** union of **husband and wife**.
The **Sage** penetrates **Yin and Yang**,
and in their **mutually concealed abode**,
steals their mechanism and inverts its use.
Thus, **conception within the womb** remains unchanged,
but **emergence from the womb** defies all measure.
Yet whether **riding the Dragon** or **controlling the Crane**,
these are but **manifestations of Yang essence’s** power.
**Spirit** accomplishes all,
**Spirit** transcends all—
how can it be confined by ordinary perception or reasoning?
