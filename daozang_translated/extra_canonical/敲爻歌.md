**"The Knocking Yarrow Song" by Lü Dongbin**

A lotus-wandering guest at Han’s end and Tang’s realm,
Thus the knocking of yarrow remains unfathomable.
Unbound by transverse or inverse, no barriers stand—
Stillness is non-action, movement is form.

Drinking wine, eating meat,
Yet holding fast to mist and flowers, cutting off lust.
Singing songs and chanting verses of rouge and powder,
Upholding precepts while wine and meat fill the belly.

Form is medicine, wine is emolument,
Within wine and sensuality, no restraints bind.
Only through flowers and wine is long life misled,
Drinking wine with flowers makes gods and ghosts weep.

Break no precepts, commit no lewdness,
For breaking precepts drowns true nature.
Lewdness corrupts the treasure of long life—
Only those with Dao-power may attain it.

Men of Dao-power, true free spirits,
Wine is their good friend, flowers their companion.
Seeking the true man in the willow lanes,
The true man is found only in the flower streets’ play.

Plucking blossoms, wearing them while drinking the wine of immortality,
In this scene, non-action makes the Dao flourish.
Let the deluded masses mock and jeer—
Immortal flowers and wine are the immortal realm.

In this realm, no ordinary guest,
The maiden and infant birth joy.
Within the grotto, four-season flowers ever bloom,
Each blossom knits the elixir of long life.

The elixir of long life, plucked from the flower’s heart,
Layer upon layer of petals, radiant spring’s splendor.
Ordinary folk know not the flower’s principle—
A single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.

Thank heaven and earth, revere the void,
To retreat as an immortal youth is to follow the ancestors.
Bend the ear to hear the primordial, wondrous essence,
Ascend Penglai’s first peak.

The first peak, a sacred thing,
Where only golden sprouts grow in the indistinct.
Mouth to mouth, the transmission leaves no written trace—
Only those with firm spiritual roots and marrow may receive it.

Firm marrow, refined roots,
Petal upon petal of peach blossoms in the grotto’s spring.
Sevens of the White Tiger nurtured in pairs,
Eights of the Green Dragon, all weighing one catty.

True father and mother, escorting the primordial palace,
Wood Mother and Metal Lord, their natures inherently gentle.
Within the twelve palaces, the toad’s essence appears,
Ever the earthly soul descends, the celestial spirit.

Lead is wrought, mercury first born,
Jade crucible and golden tripod, yet uncooked.
One husband, one wife, mirroring heaven and earth,
One man, one woman, uniting Qian and Kun.

Geng must be born, Jia must be born,
When Jia and Geng are born, the Dao begins to sprout.
Plucking the root of heaven and the marrow of earth,
White snow and yellow sprouts grow of themselves.

Lead too is born, mercury too is born,
Born to be eternally cooked as one.
This refining is not of fluids or humors,
But the essence of heaven and earth, sun and moon.

The Yellow Dame matches them to perfect union,
Transmitted mouth to mouth without a moment’s delay.
The Eight Trigrams and Three Primes rely wholly on mercury,
The Five Phases and Four Images—how could they leave lead?

Lead begets mercury, mercury begets lead,
Seizing the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s creation.
In the profound and obscure, the indistinct arises,
From the indistinct and vague, a mass coalesces.

Nature must be empty, intent must be single,
Lest the monkey-mind leap and grasp at random.
When the flower’s dew first opens, touch it not—
Lock it in the earthen cauldron, withdraw not the bolt.

Within the jade crucible, refined with gentle fire,
Through the twelve hours, guard the One.
At this time, the Yellow Path unites yin and yang,
The Three Natures and primordial palaces leak nothing.

When qi moves, true fire burns,
Let not the primordial pearl leave the sacred hall.
Adjust the fire’s timing, beware of danger—
The first nine, the hidden dragon, must not be refined.

The fire’s message shifts, the knife’s edge transforms,
The yellow sprouts of the great earth grow everywhere.
Within the reckoning of the Five Phases, one yang is born,
The twenty-four qi arrayed like strung pearls.

When the fire’s count is complete, the medicine ripens,
Then come the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl.
Three leads yield but one lead’s completion,
The golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to manifest.

Reinstall the furnace, reestablish the tripod,
Riding the tiger, mounting the dragon, leaving the mortal realm.
The sun’s essence just appears, the moon’s radiance congeals,
The two eights unite in Ren and Bing.

Dragon-mercury binds, tiger-lead forms,
Penglai is but a short journey away.
Kun-lead and Qian-mercury are the ancestors of the golden elixir,
Dragon-lead and tiger-mercury are most efficacious.

Grasp this principle, and the Dao is complete,
The thirty thousand divine farmers guard the crystal.
Guard the time, fix the day, clarify the talisman’s moment,
Devote the heart solely to reverent intent.

When black lead passes, gather the pure and true,
A single clash settles great peace.
The three carts transport treasures of pearl,
Delivered to the sacred treasury, naturally efficacious.

Heavenly spirits protect, earthly deities welcome,
Merging the essences of Qian, Kun, sun, and moon.
The tiger’s roar—once—and the dragon emerges from its den,
Phoenixes dance as the luan-birds fly from the golden city.

Cinnabar matched, mercury stilled,
A band of rosy clouds arrays before the Great Clarity.
From the lead pool, golden light emerges,
Mercury’s fiery pearls flow into the imperial capital.

Dragon and tiger mate, externally holding fullness,
The saint walks, the spirit flies within the sacred vessel.
In one hour, the golden elixir is complete,
Ascending to the golden gates as purple clouds arise.

The immortal peach ripens, pluck and consume it,
Myriad transformations come to pay homage, heaven and earth rejoice.
Observe fasting, await the birth of one yang,
Then advance the Zhou Heaven, fathoming its principle.

Fathom its principle, refine the golden elixir,
Water and fire steam through a hundred barriers.
Nurturing the embryo for ten months, the divine elixir forms—
How could a man’s pregnancy be ordinary?

The inner elixir complete, the outer elixir achieved,
Inner and outer join in harmonious union.
Formed into a single mass of purple-golden light,
Transforming and soaring through heaven and earth for ages.

The elixir enters the belly—no common thing—
The yin form is stripped away, pure yang remains.
Ascending, feather-transformed, a guest of the Three Clarities,
Name fulfilled, merit complete, reaching the highest heavens.

Guests of the Three Clarities, riding jade chariots,
Mounting cranes, soaring through the empyrean into the Great Void.
Such carefree joy and delight,
Roaming the three realms, most pure and wondrous.

Above the Great Void, the perfected cultivator,
Bright and round, nothing remains.
Nothing remains—only the Dao is manifest,
From the five directions, the true man’s visage emerges.

Immortal boys and girls welcome with colored clouds,
Within the Palace of Five Lights, the true decree is transmitted.
Transmitting the true decree, transforming hidden feelings,
The listeners and those awakened to conditions melt like ice,
Outer paths and asuras shrink back in terror.

Touching dry bones, they stand and take form,
Trusting the heavenly ladder is ever level.
Nine generations of ancestral spirits attain liberation—
Who would envy the splendor of wealth and honor?

Seek the resolute, seek the worthy,
Together set the crucible to refine the mortal frame.
If one hoards talent and begrudges treasure,
Ten thousand immortals will refuse to come.

The true cultivator speaks no falsehood,
For each reckless word incurs a great debt.
Through ten thousand kalpas in sinking sands, the Dao remains unachieved,
From all seven apertures, the eyes burst blood.

The destitute yet steadfast vow earnestly,
To gather all worldly passions and lift them away.
Joined in the immortal assembly of Penglai,
The torments of the mundane world are wholly stilled.

The mortal realm is brief—ponder it well,
For within the grotto-heavens, sun and moon stretch long.
With firm resolve and苦心 for two or three years,
Across a hundred thousand kalpas, life knows no end.

Attain the sagely Dao, perceive the true constant,
Tiger’s maw and blade’s edge bring no harm.
Water, fire, mosquitoes, dragons cause no injury,
Clapping hands, one laughs in the heavenly palace.

These merits, truly wondrous,
Yet who among men would claim them?
Foolish disciples cling to form, lust, and wealth,
Thus immortals refuse to summon them.

The true and perfect Dao makes no distinction,
Asking neither high nor low, rich nor poor.
Even princes and nobles must first cast off splendor,
Tempering their sharp edges.

If wrath remains unremoved, folly unchanged,
One plunges into the sea of samsara’s birth and death.
Heaps of gold and jade fill mountains and rivers,
Yet immortals but smile and pay no heed.

Fame is not noble, the Dao most supreme,
Sage after sage, worthy after worthy, manifest in descendants.
Girded with jade, astride a proud steed,
A fleeting glimpse—like dust in a crack.

Dust in a crack, fire in stone,
Why vainly fix the heart on lasting schemes?
Through bitter torment, none can be called back,
Seizing profit, contending for fame, like a seething cauldron.

Like a seething cauldron, mercury sinks and drowns,
Losing the Dao, deluded by truth, karma’s root.
One who levels the thorns in the heart’s field,
Shall receive the celestial mechanism revealed.

Life must be transmitted, nature must be awakened,
To enter sagehood, transcend the ordinary—this rests with you.
Few tread the path of the Three Clarities,
While many vie to enter the gates of the Six Realms.

Repay the worthy, cast aside longing,
Guard well the mechanism of life and nature.
If even one lacks fragrance,
Clinging to waves and dregs, one strays from the path.

To cultivate nature alone, neglecting life,
This is the foremost malady of practice.
To refine only the ancestral nature, not the elixir,
Through ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.

Grasping the life-school, deluded by nature’s root,
Like gazing at a reflection without a precious mirror.
A fool whose life spans heaven and earth,
Holding family wealth yet lacking the master’s handle.

To cultivate both life and nature, origin upon origin,
Ride the Dharma-wave at the ocean’s bottom in the Dharma-boat.
Capture alive the dragon’s head,
Then know the master craftsman’s skill was not in vain.
