*Abstract*

We, your ministers, respectfully note: *Wings of Laozi* in three juan was compiled by Jiao Hong of the Ming dynasty. Hong’s *Easy Explanation of the Book of Changes* has already been recorded. This work gathers sixty-four exegetes from Han Fei onward who interpreted *Laozi*, appending Hong’s own notes to form sixty-five entries. Each entry distills the finest insights into a single compilation. Where passages remain intact from beginning to end, forming complete sections, the work follows the example of Li Dingzuo’s *Collected Explications of the Zhou Changes*, marking each with the commentator’s name and placing it after the original chapter. For glosses on pronunciation, meaning, or single words and phrases, it adopts Pei Yin’s *Collected Explications of the Records of the Grand Historian*, weaving them into the text and appending them to the final sentence of the original chapter. The *Upper* and *Lower* chapters each occupy one juan, while the *Appendices* and *Textual Variants* form another, totaling three juan. The work does not impose the titles *Dao Classic* or *Virtue Classic*, nor does it arbitrarily assign chapter names. Its editorial principles are particularly aligned with those of ancient works. Most of the selected commentaries are drawn from the *Daoist Canon*, many of which are not commonly circulated in the world. Hong’s selections are notably precise and judicious, his primary aim being to elucidate the original words and clarify the principles of purity and naturalness. For instance, while figures like Ge Changgeng often conflated Daoist alchemical practices with Chan Buddhist repartee, though their names are listed, their interpretations are largely excluded. Among the various commentaries, the work is both erudite and reasoned. This is because Hong’s scholarship in the teachings of the Two Schools (Daoism and Buddhism) was profound, surpassing even his grasp of Confucianism. Thus, his explanations of Confucian principles often stray into vagueness, while his exegesis of the Two Schools’ doctrines demonstrates discernment and originality.

Respectfully submitted for imperial review in the second month of the forty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign.

*Preface to the Wings of Laozi*

*Laozi* is a book that illuminates the Dao. So too did Wang Zhen of the Tang dynasty...

Those who go so far as to claim it was composed as a treatise on warfare—could it be that even the words on fine soldiers and skillful battle have somehow inspired them? I say: Laozi does not speak of warfare. It illuminates the attainment of suppleness. Of all things under heaven that delight in strength, none surpasses warfare, and yet even warfare is made to yield through suppleness. From this, one may infer that where there is no suppleness, there is no Dao. Suppleness is the opposite of rigidity. The Dao is present in all things, yet why does it uniquely favor suppleness and treat rigidity as secondary?

I say: Laozi does not speak of suppleness. It illuminates non-action. Suppleness is not the Dao itself, but it approaches non-action. Rigidity is not outside the Dao, but it distances itself from non-action. Thus, by seeking through suppleness, non-action may be guarded. That which is non-existent cannot but have existence, just as suppleness cannot be without rigidity. Yet when one establishes it upon the constancy of non-being and being, the world’s benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom do not cease to be discarded. This is merely another case of elevating one while abolishing the hundred.

I say: Laozi does not speak of the non-existence of non-being. It illuminates the non-being of existence. The non-existence of non-being is to abandon existence in pursuit of non-being—its name is "severance." The non-being of existence is to use existence to verify non-being—its teaching is "returning to the root." If all things return to their roots, then though the ten thousand beings flourish together, they ultimately cannot be called "existent." This is the ultimate of attaining emptiness and maintaining quiescence.

Scholars know the vessel but not the Dao, hence the *Yi* clarifies the Dao through the vessel. They see form but not emptiness, hence Buddhism clarifies emptiness through form. They grasp being but not non-being, hence Laozi clarifies non-being through being. If one truly understands that being is non-being, then in non-action, affairs are not acted upon, yet nothing is left undone, and nothing can obstruct it. What, then, is there to discard?

Thus it is said: *Laozi* is a book that illuminates the Dao. I was once fond of rigidity and forceful conduct, reading *Laozi* as if feeding through the ears—no different from not having read it at all. At twenty-three, I heard the teachings of masters and friends and gradually turned my mind to learning, though I found it difficult to enter. There were those who guided me with what they called "luminous clarity," and I rejoiced as if it resonated within. Reflecting upon it in my heart was like a horse with bit and bridle, or a door with hinge and pivot. Comparing it with the teachings of recent Confucians was like tallying pieces that fit perfectly.

Believing the Dao to lie therein, I looked back upon twenty years—wherever I turned, obstacles arose. Where there were obstacles, there were doubts. Examining antiquity, I found much that clashed; where there was clash, there was contradiction. Never for a moment did this leave my thoughts.

In recent years, worn down by hardship and long illness, in the stillness of convalescence, I suddenly awoke alone and sighed deeply, saying: In the past, I never failed to reject the discriminating mind, yet sometimes sought to extinguish it in pursuit of quiescence. I never failed to prize the mindless state, yet did not know that the original mind is naturally without knowing. I yearned for purity and stillness, yet did not know that the stainless is not pure. I knew of the true self, yet did not know that where there is no thing, there is no self. All this was led astray by the teachings of others.

From then on, as I pursued my views, they vanished without a trace, and I, too, fortunately became a man of non-action. At that time, my friend Zhai Defo, who was fond of discussing *Laozi*, would occasionally bring it up to test me. I responded with my recent insights, and Defo never failed to applaud them. He urged me to write an exposition, so I gathered my family’s old copies of *Laozi* along with those collected in the Daoist Canon, reading through them all—sixty-four versions in total. How vast their words! Among them, though statements that betray the Dao and depart from the classics were not uncommon, those that accorded were not few.

Reciting and chanting in cycles, I sighed deeply—ah! The five thousand words of *Laozi* are sometimes said to encompass the entire book of Rongchengzi. *Liezi* also claims that the "Valley Spirit" chapter was not written by the Yellow Emperor, hence the saying: "Transmitting but not creating, trusting and cherishing antiquity, I compare myself to Lao Peng." The sages of old could illuminate the Dao without it all necessarily originating from themselves. How much less, then, could I—whose understanding of this matter is but a fraction of a hair’s tip, not even one ten-thousandth—presume to add to it?

Thus, I set aside my own composition and instead gathered the commentaries of earlier scholars, arranging and compiling them into a single volume, with a few superficial insights of my own appended. Defo, meanwhile, was still in the midst of explicating the *Yinfu Jing* and had not yet completed it. When he finishes, we shall present both works together to scholars. For now, I merely record this preface and keep it in my home.

The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
The name that can be named is not the constant name.
Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
Named, it is the mother of the myriad things.
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its mystery;
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet differ in name—
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and ever more profound:
The gateway to all mysteries.

[The "can be spoken" is like ritual—Dao is not vainly spoken.
"Constant" means enduring and unchanging.
"Mother" signifies that things arise from it.
"Desire" is like the desires of human nature; "之欲" means intention or emotion.
"Manifestations" (徼) are the apertures through which things emerge, or their boundaries, their returns.
Chen Jingyuan says: "At the edge of the great Dao are small paths called *jiao*."
Ding Yidong says: "The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things." Some read this as "nameless and named," while others read it as "nonbeing and being." Yet Laozi also says, "The Dao is constantly nameless; only when the beginning is instituted does it have a name"—how then can it be read as "nonbeing and being"?
Those who read it as "constantly without, constantly with" and those who read it as "without desire, with desire"—Zhuangzi says, "Establish it in the constant of nonbeing and being," directly pointing to Laozi’s words, so the punctuation of "constantly without, constantly with" seems correct. Yet Laozi also says, "Constantly without desire, it can be named as small"—this cannot be used as evidence from Zhuangzi. Laozi should be read as Laozi.]

Cheng Ju’s Discourse:
The Dao that can be spoken is for regulating conduct;
The name that can be named is for establishing speech.
As for the constant Dao that cannot be spoken,
The constant name that cannot be named—
The sage does not dare to reveal it to others.
Not that it is concealed in secrecy and withheld,
But that it cannot be shown to others.

Thus, the sages of the Western Regions manifest their teachings through three vehicles and expound them into twelve divisions, calling them "teachings." Yet what is transmitted beyond these teachings is precisely that which cannot be spoken and cannot be named. The sages of China—from the lineage of Tang, Yu, Xia, Wen, and Wu—codified the texts of the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music, calling them "classics." Yet what their words tread like footprints that are not the path itself is also that which cannot be spoken and cannot be named. Therefore, Laozi composed his five-thousand-character text to reveal it to the world and guide later generations, not retreating into the obscurity of the Dao to hoard it for himself. Thus, the opening of his words speaks of the Dao that can be spoken and the name that can be named—these are what the five-thousand-character text encompasses. As for what the sages do not transmit, it cannot be put into words.

Su Ziyou’s commentary:
All is the Dao, yet what can be spoken of it cannot be constant. Only what cannot be spoken of is truly constant. Consider benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—these are the Dao that can be spoken. Yet benevolence cannot become righteousness, nor can propriety become wisdom; what can be spoken of is thus not constant. Only what cannot be spoken of remains in benevolence as benevolence, in righteousness as righteousness, and so too with propriety and wisdom—these are all inconstant, while the Dao remains unchanging. Such is the constancy of what cannot be spoken. If the Dao cannot be spoken, how much less can it be named? All names belong to what can be spoken. Once a name is established, the differences between round and square, crooked and straight cannot be constant. Before names took form, there were heaven and earth; once heaven and earth were established, names began. From the dissemination of names arose the myriad things, and with the flourishing of the myriad things, names became innumerable. Thus, the nameless is the essence of the Dao, while the named is its function. The sage embodies the Dao to function in the world, entering into the realm of multiplicity while remaining in the constant of nonbeing to observe its subtleties. Embodying the utmost nonbeing while abiding in the constant of being, he observes its manifestations. Yet if one acts within manifestations without knowing the subtleties, one remains coarse and unspiritual; if one dwells in subtleties without knowing the manifestations, one becomes refined but unchanging. In terms of form, being and nonbeing are indeed two—how can one know that nonbeing transforms into being and being returns to nonbeing, never not unified? Though their names differ, their root is one. To know the unity of the root is to attain the profound. Whatever is boundless and without limit must be profound in color; thus, Laozi often used "profound" to signify the ultimate. To speak of the profound is to reach it, yet the mind that clings to the profound still remains. Profound upon profound—only then is it exhausted, beyond further addition. This is the source from which all subtleties arise.

Lǚ Jifu annotates:
All the Ways under heaven that can be spoken of are indeed the Dao, yet there are times when they verge on peril—such are not the constant Dao. All the names under heaven that can be named are indeed names, yet there are times when they depart—such are not the constant names. The myriad things flourish and flourish, each returning to its root, yet they know it not. Stillness is called "returning to destiny"; returning to destiny is called "constancy." To be constant is to attain the Dao. When one reaches constancy, the mind congeals, form dissolves, and self and other are all forgotten. Who then knows what can be spoken as Dao or named as name? Thus, the constant Dao is inherently unspeakable. Therefore it is said: "The Dao buries itself in long obscurity, never imperiled." The constant name is inherently unnameable. Therefore it is said: "From ancient times to now, its name does not depart." Not imperiled, not departed—this is called the constant Dao. The constant nonbeing of name—this nonbeing is the Dao, the origin from which heaven and earth themselves arise. Thus it is said: "Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth." In the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing; there was no nonbeing, no name. When there was no nonbeing, even "one" could not be attained. When there was no name, this was the arising of the one. There was one, yet no form had appeared. To call it "one" is already to have a name, though no form yet exists. The name "one" and that which names it make two; two and one make three. From this, the myriad things in profusion arise. Thus it is said: "The named is the mother of the myriad things." To know constancy is called "clarity"; clarity sees all without obstruction. Only constancy allows one to observe: when there is no desire, one purifies and polishes the profound mirror, leaving no flaw in this observation of the subtle. Thus it is said: "Constantly without desire, one may name it the small." When there is desire, the myriad things arise together in profusion; in this, one observes their manifestations. Thus it is said: "The myriad things all return to it, yet they know not their master—one may name it the great." Only the small reveals the subtle; only the great reveals the manifest. These two emerge from the same source, yet their names differ—nothing more. Though their names differ, their reality has never differed. Whether in desire or the absence of desire, their source cannot be sought. If it cannot be sought, then their source is the same. Thus it is called "profound." Is the color of profundity the same whether black or red? One. Is the color of heaven the same whether in yin or yang? One. Do names arise from the profound in the same way, whether in desire or its absence? One. They are the same.

One is indeed wondrous—yet is it wondrous only as One? Is it not also wondrous as Many? Is it wondrous only as the self? Is it not also wondrous as things? When the profound is pursued to the utmost profundity, even sameness cannot be found. If sameness cannot be found, then neither One nor Many, neither self nor things—all are wondrous without exception. The wondrousness of the myriad things arises from this alone. Thus it is said: "The profound pursued to the utmost profundity is the gateway to all wonders."

Li Xizhai’s Commentary:
"Constant" means unchanging. Things change, but the Dao does not. The changes of things extend to the fleeting of thoughts and the passing of moments, never pausing for even an instant. Yet what is called the Dao has no beginning and no end; heaven and earth may perish, but this Dao does not—this is what is meant by "constant." As the constant Dao, it cannot be traversed to its end, nor can it be named to be attained. If it could be traversed, it would not be the constant Dao; if it could be named, it would not be the constant name. Before the beginning of heaven and earth, the principle of true constancy was already present in the nameless origin. Thus, the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. Once heaven and earth were divided, names arose for high and low, and the myriad things multiplied from this point onward. Thus, what can be named is the mother of things.

The sage embodies the Dao of true constancy, moving between being and non-being. The wondrous is the great Dao—non-being. The manifest is the lesser Dao—being. If I wish to observe the wondrous, I enter into wondrousness and return to non-being. If I wish to observe the manifest, I emerge with manifestation and wander in being. The wondrous is the manifest; the manifest is the wondrous. Being is emptiness; emptiness is being. Their root is the same, though their branches differ. Thus, they are both called "profound." And not only this: when the profound is pursued to the utmost profundity, it enables all manifestations to be nothing but wonders. This is called "the gateway to all wonders," for within manifestation and wondrousness, being and non-being, there is no distinction—all are wondrous.

*Bishu*:
The character *jiao* (徼) is read like the *jiao* in "frontier" (边徼), referring to the furthest extent of things. Yanzi said, "Manifestation is the return of virtue." Liezi said, "Death is the furthest extent of virtue." Both refer to the point of exhaustion. When there is non-being, nothing remains to be said. Yet when desire arises, people cling to being as if it were real. But desire must come to an end, and when it is exhausted, having reached its limit with nowhere else to go, it must return to non-being. How is this different from wondrousness? Thus it is said: "These two are called the same profound." Nevertheless, Laozi spoke thus out of necessity for those who have not yet awakened. In truth, he did not advocate abandoning being to seek non-being. If one were to abandon being to seek non-being, then beyond being there would be non-being—how could this be true non-being? When being is present, it has never truly been being—this is genuine non-being. Thus, form is not destroyed to become emptiness; form is emptiness. Affairs are not negated to become emptiness; affairs are emptiness. Otherwise, the so-called non-being would be non-being in opposition to being, and the so-called being would be being in opposition to non-being. How could this be called constant non-being or constant being? Alas, how can one who does not know the constant engage in discussion of this?

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness is already present. When all know goodness as goodness, non-goodness is already present. Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short shape each other; high and low incline toward each other; sound and voice harmonize with each other; front and back follow one another. Therefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices wordless teaching. The myriad things arise, yet he does not reject them; he gives life, yet does not possess; he acts, yet does not rely on it; he accomplishes, yet does not dwell in it. It is precisely because he does not dwell that it does not depart.

Lu Xisheng’s Commentary:
What people call beauty and ugliness arise from emotion: what conforms to emotion is beauty, what opposes it is ugliness. The same applies to goodness and non-goodness. Yet what is deemed beautiful is not necessarily beautiful; what is deemed ugly is not necessarily ugly; what is deemed good is not necessarily good; what is deemed non-good is not necessarily non-good. Why is this? Emotion is the cause. Human nature is fundamentally the same, but emotions differ. When these differing emotions are externally affected by things, likes and dislikes become entangled, and beauty and ugliness have no fixed standard. How can this be corrected? It lies in returning to nature. Why? The arising of emotion must originate from nature. Thus, the sage transforms emotion to return to nature, reaching great unity. What is called "being and non-being giving rise to each other" refers to emotion and nature. The mutual dependence of emotion and nature is like the mutual completion of difficulty and ease. Those who govern by using emotion to transform nature find it difficult to succeed; those who use nature to correct emotion find it easy. What is called "long and short shaping each other" refers to beauty and ugliness. The competition between beauty and ugliness is like the inclination of high and low. What is called "sound and voice harmonizing with each other" refers to goodness and non-goodness. The mutual reliance of goodness and non-goodness is like the following of front and back. Alas, the world’s many troubles arise from these six. This is why the world is not at peace, and the myriad things cannot fulfill their nature. The sage, wishing to restore their nature, first transforms their emotions. Those who are already good are confirmed in their goodness; those who are not good are also led to goodness, so that all become good. Those who are already trustworthy are confirmed in their trust; those who are not trustworthy are also led to trust, so that all become trustworthy. Thus, nothing is discarded in things, and no one is abandoned in teaching. When things have no ugliness and people have no non-goodness, an ungoverned world has never existed. The *Yijing* says: "Its Dao is vast, and the hundred things are not abandoned." This is what it means.

Therefore, the sage embodies the nameless and thus acts without action, and affairs settle themselves. He employs the named and thus teaches without words, and instruction proceeds on its own. He enables the myriad things to fulfill their nature as if nothing had caused it—like heaven and earth giving life to things without possessing them, like the hundred craftsmen making tools without relying on them, like the four seasons completing the year without dwelling in it. Only in this way can his Dao be constant and his name not depart.

Su’s Commentary:
All under heaven speak of beauty and ugliness in terms of form and name. What they call beautiful and good—are these truly beautiful and good? They do not know that being and non-being, long and short, difficulty and ease, high and low, sound and voice, front and back—all arise and compete with one another, and none are in their true state. When one takes oneself to be long, and another longer appears, one becomes short. When one takes oneself to be ahead, and another appears before, one becomes behind. If one follows what is deemed beautiful and trusts it, one strays far from the truth. When acting, one should have the mind of non-action; when teaching, one should have the intention of wordless instruction. Only thus can one transcend the measures of long and short, depart from the calculations of front and back—neither beautiful nor ugly, neither good nor non-good. How could all under heaven know this? The myriad things act for me, yet I do not reject them; I give life to them, yet do not possess them; I act, yet do not rely on it; I accomplish, yet do not dwell in it.

Thus is the reward of non-action and wordless teaching—even the sage does not know it as beauty or goodness. How then could there be evil or non-goodness following it? The sage dwells in poverty and lowliness yet knows no sorrow of poverty and lowliness; dwells in wealth and nobility yet bears no burden of wealth and nobility. This is what is called "not dwelling." If I do not dwell, how can that which is other depart? This is the ultimate dwelling.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
All under heaven know beauty as beauty and goodness as goodness, desiring them; know evil and non-goodness, and despise them. Yet, speaking from the departure from the Dao, even beauty and goodness are far from the Dao. Speaking from the arising of the Dao, even evil and non-goodness are not outside the Dao. From this perspective, beauty becomes evil, and goodness becomes non-goodness—how could this be empty words? Therefore, the things of the world are born from being, and being is born from non-being. This is called the mutual arising of being and non-being. Difficult tasks arise from the easy, yet the easy also arises from the difficult. This is called the mutual completion of difficulty and ease. Only when there is the long leg of the crane does one know the short leg of the wild duck; only when there is the short leg of the wild duck does one know the long leg of the crane. This is called the mutual formation of long and short. If height is affirmed, yet the hundred valleys are the source of rivers and streams, then height has that which topples it. If lowliness is affirmed, yet rivers and streams are the gathering of the hundred valleys, then lowliness has that which topples it. This is called the mutual toppling of high and low. When the Yellow Bell is sovereign, the remaining pitches harmonize with it; when the remaining pitches are sovereign, the Yellow Bell harmonizes with them. This is called the mutual harmony of sounds. Gazing from autumn and winter toward spring and summer, spring and summer come before, and autumn and winter follow; gazing from spring and summer toward autumn and winter, autumn and winter come before, and spring and summer follow. This is called the mutual following of front and back. In all these six cases, when they accord with their time and fit their circumstances, all under heaven call them beautiful and good; when they do not accord with their time and do not fit their circumstances, all under heaven call them evil and non-good. How could they know what is called the ultimate beauty and ultimate goodness? Thus, beauty and evil, goodness and non-goodness, alternately come and go, rise and fall—how could they be constant? Therefore, the sage, knowing this, employs the constant Dao to handle affairs, and affairs arise from non-action; employs the constant name to conduct teaching, and teaching arises from wordlessness. When affairs arise from non-action, one acts all day yet has never acted; when teaching arises from wordlessness, one speaks all day yet has never spoken. Then, how could I harbor concern for beauty or evil, goodness or non-goodness? Being thus, there is nowhere that is not wondrous. If nowhere is not wondrous, then in the arising of the myriad things, I do not see their arising or the one who causes their arising; do not see their birth or the one who gives them birth; do not see their acting or the one who acts. Thus, though they arise, it is as if they do not arise; though they are born, it is as if they are not born; though they act, it is as if they do not act. How could I reject, possess, rely, or dwell? This is why one accomplishes yet does not dwell. Without dwelling, there is nothing to depart—where could one depart to?

**Lu Nongshi’s Annotation:**
When beauty reaches non-beauty, it is the true beauty of the world; when goodness reaches non-goodness, it is the true goodness of the world. Once true beauty departs, all under heaven know beauty as beauty; once true goodness scatters, all under heaven know goodness as goodness. Therefore, being and non-being speak of the Dao; difficulty and ease speak of its power; long and short speak of its form; high and low speak of its position; sounds speak of its mutual resonance; front and back speak of its beginning and end. Such is the nature of things. The sage engages in affairs of non-action and practices wordless teaching to guide people toward true goodness, merge with true beauty, return to simplicity, and become companions with heaven and earth, friends with creation. Being thus, the ceasing of the myriad things enters with them without resistance; the arising of the myriad things departs with them without rejection. How could I harbor concern?

**Wang Wujiu’s Exegesis:**
The sage engages in affairs of non-action and practices wordless teaching, having no intention of acting or speaking, merely following the principles of the nature and destiny of the myriad things. Thus, when the myriad things arise, I arise with them without rejection; when the myriad things are born, I am born with them without possession; when the myriad things act, I act with them without reliance; when the myriad things accomplish, I accomplish with them without dwelling. For their arising, birth, acting, and accomplishment all follow the principles of nature and destiny, aligning with things and time, and are not of me. Then, why must I reject, possess, rely, or dwell? Therefore, it is said: "The myriad things arise together, yet I do not reject them; they are born, yet I do not possess them; I act, yet do not rely on it; I accomplish, yet do not dwell." First there is arising, then birth; first birth, then acting; first acting, then accomplishment—this is their sequence.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
The five thousand words of Laozi can ascend to the profound and descend to the subtle; seeking the Dao through them, the Dao is attained; governing the state through them, the state is well-ordered; cultivating the self through them, the self is at peace. Their words always penetrate these three realms—this is why they are subtle, wondrous, and profoundly unfathomable. This chapter speaks of my original nature, which from the beginning has never had things—who then is beautiful, who is evil, who is good, who is non-good? Once life arises and forms and names are established, people all know beauty as beauty yet do not know that the name of evil already arises from beauty; all know goodness as goodness yet do not know that the name of non-goodness already arises from goodness. For there is nothing in the world without its counterpart: being and non-being arise mutually; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low topple each other; sounds harmonize with each other; front and back follow each other. There is never one without the other. The sage, knowing this, must stand before things, follow their nature, engage in affairs of non-action, practice wordless teaching, neither grasping goodness nor rejecting evil, never clinging to one, never not being one. Acting all day, yet never acting; speaking all day, yet never speaking. Thus, when the myriad things arise together, I follow and arise with them, arising without rejection; when the myriad things are born together, I follow and am born with them, being born without possession. When they act, it is not my acting—merely following things. Thus, acting without reliance. When they accomplish, it is not my accomplishment—merely responding to things. Thus, accomplishing without dwelling. By not dwelling in the end but dwelling in the beginning, what I dwell in cannot be departed from. Therefore, things cannot depart.

Wu Youqing’s annotation states: "These five all speak of their paired aspects, yet sound is not mentioned as such. For if one only says 'opening and closing, clarity and turbidity,' people would not recognize it as sound. If one speaks of sound, then the paired aspects of opening and closing, clarity and turbidity are naturally understood, so one need only speak of its essence and not its pairing.

The sage, by not engaging in affairs, engages in affairs—thus their affairs involve no action. By not teaching, they teach—thus their teaching involves no words. Without action and without words, though there is beauty and goodness, people do not recognize it. Therefore, their beauty and goodness are uniquely revered and uniquely valued, without anything to oppose them. If there were affairs of action and teachings of words, people would all recognize them as beauty and goodness, and beauty would oppose ugliness, goodness would oppose ungoodness—such beauty and goodness could not be called uniquely revered or uniquely valued, nor could they be named as nameless beauty and goodness. Throughout the *Laozi*, all chapters speak of nothing beyond this."

"Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.
Not valuing rare goods prevents the people from stealing.
Not displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from chaos.
Thus, in the sage’s governance:
Empty their hearts,
Fill their bellies,
Weaken their ambitions,
Strengthen their bones.
Ever cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire,
So that those with knowledge dare not act.
Act through non-action, and nothing is left ungoverned."

*(The pronunciation of 治 is *zhì*; the first 知 in "无知" is read as *zhī*, while the second 知 in "知者" is read as *zhì*; 夫 is pronounced *fú*.)*

Wang Fusi says: "The heart harbors wisdom, the belly harbors food. To be empty is to have wisdom, yet in reality to be without knowledge. The bones, being without knowledge, are thus strong; the ambitions, born of affairs, are thus weakened."

Su’s annotation states: "Exalting the worthy causes the people to feel shame in not matching others, leading to contention. Valuing rare goods causes the people to suffer from lack, leading to theft. Displaying what is desirable causes the people to worry over not obtaining it, leading to chaos. Though the world knows these three as sources of trouble and wishes to abolish them, it remains deluded.

The sage does not act thus: they do not fail to employ the worthy, only they do not exalt them; they do not discard rare goods, only they do not value them; they do not eliminate desire, only they do not display it."

Thus, when the worthy are employed yet the people do not contend, when rare goods and desirable things are all displayed before them yet theft, calamity, and chaos do not arise—is this not to empty the heart without harming the fullness of the belly, to weaken the ambitions without harming the strength of the bones?

Now, if one were to promote the worthy and exalt them, treasure goods and value them, and display what is desirable, then both heart and belly would be filled. If one were to abolish and discard them altogether, then both ambitions and bones would be weakened. When heart and belly are both full, the people contend; when ambitions and bones are both weak, they have nothing with which to stand. If one does not employ these three, the people know not what to admire, remaining tranquil and without desire—even the clever have no craft to employ.

Following the natural course of these three without exalting, without valuing, without displaying—this is what is called "acting through non-action."

Lu’s annotation states: The sage knows that beauty gives rise to ugliness and goodness to its opposite, yet remains without preference. Thus, though they bind the world’s ranks to their service, they merely employ them—worthiness is not what they exalt. Though they gather the world’s wealth to nourish the people, rare goods are not what they value. The people’s contention commonly arises from mutual esteem of worthiness; if worthiness is not what the ruler exalts, they do not contend. Thus it is said: "Promote the worthy, and the people contend with one another." The people’s theft commonly arises from desire for profit; if goods are not what the ruler values, they do not become thieves. Thus it is said: "If the master is without desire, though you reward them, they do not steal." What the noble person desires is worthiness; what the petty person desires is goods. If I do not display what is desirable, the heart is not disordered.

Yet not exalting the worthy does not mean abandoning them in the wilds and not employing them; not valuing rare goods does not mean casting them to the ground and not gathering them. It is merely that inwardly, they are not stored in the heart, and outwardly, their traces are not left behind.

Thus, in the sage’s governance: empty the heart and fill the belly, weaken the ambitions and strengthen the bones. The heart stores the spirit, and the belly is the heart’s dwelling; empty the heart, and the spirit is not diminished while the belly is full. The kidneys store the ambitions, and the bones are the kidneys’ surplus; weaken the ambitions, and the essence is not disturbed while the bones are strong. Empty the heart and fill the belly, and the people are constantly made without knowledge. Weaken the ambitions and strengthen the bones, and the people are constantly made without desire. When the wise know that worthiness is not what the ruler exalts and goods are not what the ruler values, their actions are not profitable, and so they dare not act. Only thus does one act through non-action and yet nothing is left ungoverned.

Li Hongfu’s commentary states:

The origin of contention and theft is opened by the sage. Thus, the highest contend over goodness, and the next steal the state—all arise from the sight of what is desirable. When the ear hears what is desirable, and such desires are many, the people’s ambitions are thrown into chaos. How can there be governance? As for the Supreme, does he truly possess a means to govern this? It is merely that he does not display what is desirable.

The belly is not full because the heart is burdened. Now, if there is nothing seen that can be desired, exalted, or valued, then the heart is empty and the belly naturally full. The bones are not firm because the ambitions are broken. If one dares not engage in rebellious contention or thievery, then the ambitions are weakened and the bones naturally strong. The reason for this is the absence of desire.

The people are born with desires and without knowledge, yet the sage daily leads them to acquire knowledge. He arrays benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, guides them with laws, regulations, and prohibitions, and establishes palaces, clothing, carriages, horses, caps, marriages, defenses, and sacrifices—awakening their boundless knowledge, only then to restrain their endless desires. This is like flooding waters overwhelming the heavens, then attempting to block them with a single reed. How can this succeed?

The Supreme acts otherwise: he constantly keeps them in a state of primal chaos, without knowledge and without desire. Even if those with intelligence and understanding emerge, wishing to act, they dare not do so, and so the world all returns to non-action. Non-action arises from the absence of desire, and the absence of desire arises from the absence of knowledge. How can one person cause the people to be without knowledge? The Supreme simply claims he himself has never possessed knowledge. He does not display what can be governed, and the people are thus made to follow the desires of his own heart.

The Dao flows emptily, yet its use is never exhausted—profound as an abyss, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts their sharpness, unravels their tangles, harmonizes their radiance, and mingles with their dust. Deep and still, it seems to abide—yet I know not whose child it is, for it appears before the Lord of Creation.

*(The character 冲 was originally written as 盅, signifying the emptiness of a vessel. Li Yue notes: "The Lord is the master who gives birth to things; all transformations follow after, yet only the Dao alone dwells before them. 象 means 'to resemble.' The nature of the Dao is humility, so it does not claim a fixed place before all things but says only that it 'seems' to be so.)*

*(Su's commentary: The Dao is utterly empty, yet when applied to the manifold existences, even the vastness of heaven and earth or the breadth of mountains and rivers cannot contain it. Because it is formless, it seems never full—profound and boundless, I know it as the ancestor of the myriad things, yet dare not speak of it directly, thus saying only that it 'seems' the ancestor of the myriad things. All people possess the Dao, yet only the sage can preserve it whole. Blunting its sharpness prevents it from straying into recklessness; unraveling its tangles prevents it from clashing with things. Freed from recklessness and conflict, external troubles vanish, and radiance arises. Yet the sage further harmonizes this radiance, lest it set itself apart from things. Radiance is most pure; dust is most mixed. Though mingled with dust, nothing is excluded, lest it abandon the myriad things. Only thus preserved whole does it abide, deep and constant. Though it abides, none recognize it, so it is said only to 'seem' to exist. The Dao, though ever-present, can never be named, yet neither can it be called nothing. Thus it is said: How could this not precede the Lord? It precedes the Lord, and yet nothing precedes it.)*

Lü’s Commentary:
All things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the qi of the Unfathomable—this "unfathomable" is the harmony of yin and yang. Yin is emptiness; yang is fullness. The body of the Dao is unfathomable, yet in its function it may not be full—its body is unfathomable. Thus, whether with desire or without, it is equally called "mysterious"; in its function, it is not full. Therefore, empty the heart and weaken the will, ever causing the people to remain without knowledge or desire. Only thus does it become profound, seeming the ancestor of the myriad things, yet those who seek to make it their ancestor assuredly cannot obtain it—it only *seems* so.

How then may one attain this Dao? By blunting its sharpness, unraveling its tangles, harmonizing its radiance, and mingling with the dust—nothing more. When the heart projects outward and enters things, this is sharpness; blunt its sharpness and do not act. When things arrive and the heart engages, this is entanglement; unravel its tangles and do not disturb. With sharpness blunted and tangles unraveled, the clarity of constant knowing arises.

Heavenly radiance—radiance lies beyond the dust, yet its light is not dazzling, so one harmonizes it without distinction. Dust lies within radiance, yet it is not obscured, so one mingles with it without differentiation. Only thus does that which is called the "ancestor" abide, deep and seemingly present. "Profound"—this speaks of its depth.

Deep—this speaks of its clarity. That which "may not be full" cannot be deemed a fixed emptiness; that which "seems to abide" cannot be deemed a fixed presence. In fullness and emptiness, presence and absence, I hold no preference—how then could I know their origin? I see only their arising as Heaven, as spirits, as the Lord-on-High. Thus it is said: "I know not whose child it is—it seems to precede the Lord of Images." For where there is "I" and "knowing," the Dao is already concealed. If I know not who it is, then I also know not myself—this is the true source from which the Dao emerges.

That which precedes the birth of Heaven, that which begins before the Lord of Images and spirits, its priority to all forms and vessels may be known. **Xizhai’s Commentary:** The Dao is empty and subtle, so close it seems unattainable—thus it is said, "may not be full." Yet the deeper its subtlety, the more inexhaustible its use. All things arise from the Dao, yet the Dao never becomes a thing—thus it is said, "seems the ancestor of the myriad things." Those of old who studied the Dao never set their minds on advancement, yet inevitably embodied it. To "blunt its sharpness" is not a deliberate act; to "unravel its tangles" is to act without hindrance. To "harmonize its radiance" is not to seek goodness; to "mingle with the dust" is not to reject the bad. Abiding in clarity without clinging to clarity—thus it "seems to abide." I know not its beginning, so I know not whose child it is; I know not its priority, so it seems to precede the Lord of Images.

**Shaobian’s Commentary:** Sharpness is what leads to contention—blunting sharpness thus unravels tangles. Radiance is what enables distinction—harmonizing radiance thus mingles with the dust. The first two "its" refer to oneself; the latter two "its" refer to others.

**Hongfu’s Commentary:** That which is empty and boundless yet never full is the Dao. But those who employ it may perceive it as full, thereby losing its boundless emptiness. Thus, profound and still, though all streams return to it, no fullness is seen. The sage embodies the Dao in his person—deep, tranquil, and immeasurable, like the ancestor of the myriad things, yet without any intent to rule them. Thus he constantly blunts his sharpness to appear incapable, unravels his tangles to appear inept, harmonizes his radiance to move through the world, and mingles with the dust to blend with the common. Profoundly still, seeming to vanish yet abiding—ah! Yet whose child is this, truly?

I fear this Dao—even the Yellow Emperor would find it difficult to fully grasp. Perhaps its origins lie before the Emperor’s time? The sea is the ancestor of all streams, yet the sea itself is nothing—one sees only its profound depth. The sage is the ancestor of the myriad things, yet the sage himself is nothing—one sees only his stillness. Those who gallop in ability, flaunt their talents, and dazzle the crowd do so by relying on what they *have*, seeking to connect with things through possession. They are not the ancestor of the myriad things. Only one who has no such ancestor can truly be the ancestor of all things—yet who would believe this?

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as straw dogs. The space between Heaven and Earth—is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it yields. Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion; better to hold to the center.

**Su’s Commentary:** Heaven and Earth are impartial, allowing the myriad things to follow their nature. Thus, things live and die of themselves—death is not their oppression, nor life their benevolence. It is like binding straw into dogs for sacrifice: adorned and offered with care, yet not out of love. Once the ritual ends, they are discarded, trampled underfoot—yet not out of hatred. It is simply the way of things. The sage’s relation to the people is the same: so long as he does no harm, the people preserve their nature. Life and death proceed without his interference. Though he has never acted with benevolence, his benevolence is vast.

Consider the bellows and its pipe: when set in motion, its breath reaches everywhere, and the unknowing marvel at its ingenuity. Yet what does the bellows itself do? It remains empty and unobstructed, thus the more it moves, the more it yields. The workings of Heaven and Earth—giving life, bringing death, carving the myriad forms—are no different. Seeing only its movement and abundance, one fails to recognize that it is the emptiness within that responds. Thus, it is said: much speech leads to frequent exhaustion; better to hold to the center, which knows no end.

**Lü’s Commentary:** The Dao existed before the image of the Emperor, and none can trace its origin. How then could one who embodies this Dao be named by benevolence? Benevolence is merely a human sentiment. Heaven and Earth embody the Dao, and thus do not act with benevolence, treating the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage embodies the Dao, and thus does not act with benevolence, treating the people as straw dogs. Straw dogs are things without benevolence, yet those who keep them do so without acting with benevolence. The myriad things share the same body as Heaven and Earth; the people share the same body as the sage. If Heaven and Earth regard themselves as straw dogs, then their view of the myriad things is no different. To give life, to nurture, to raise, to cultivate—where is the need for benevolence? Only by being without benevolence does one achieve true benevolence.

Thus, the space between Heaven and Earth is indeed like a bellows. The bellows, by being empty and unobstructed, moves and yields ever more. So too the one who embodies the Dao: his words arise from non-words, and thus his actions are non-action. Whether speaking or acting, in essence, they are one. Why? Because the body of speech and action is thus. Without this understanding, words do not arise from non-words, and thus differ from the emptiness of the bellows. Once set in motion, they multiply and quickly reach exhaustion—is this not inevitable?

Confucius said: *"Who among those singing today truly understands?"* Knowing this, one knows that words arise from non-words. Words arise from non-words—none do otherwise. Yet they cannot do so because their minds cling to *having*. Clinging to having, they cannot align with the Dao. Only by neither having nor lacking, neither grasping nor rejecting, can one align with the Dao. This is called *holding to the center*. Holding to the center without cease, one understands the source of words. Thus, much speech leads to frequent exhaustion; better to make holding to the center one’s duty.

**Wang Chunfu’s Commentary:** Straw dogs illustrate the sage’s wondrous transformation; the bellows illustrates the sage’s wondrous preservation of spirit. *"Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion; better to hold to the center"*—these are Laozi’s words of caution. The Dao cannot be spoken, yet he rebukes it as "not benevolent." The Dao cannot be named, yet he describes it as a bellows. The wise grasp the meaning and forget the words, but the unwise fail to perceive the truth and merely argue endlessly. Thus, my words reach exhaustion. The *center* is the center—emptiness, nothingness, that which cannot be spoken or named.

Holding to this, the mind’s thoughts cease, the path of words is severed—what exhaustion is there to fear? Laozi wrote a book expounding the Dao, yet his words are thus: how profound was his sense of being compelled! Later scholars, failing to grasp the meaning of his words about straw dogs and common folk, instead suspect him of harboring contempt for the people, even claiming that the cruelty of Shen Buhai and Han Fei originated in the *Daodejing*. Sima Qian already held this view—how much more so others? This is precisely one instance of "much speech leading to frequent exhaustion." Laozi had foreseen it.

The valley spirit does not die—
This is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle, it seems to endure;
In use, it is not exhausted.

**Gu Shen’s Commentary:** The valley is a metaphor: because it is empty, it can receive; receiving, it does not possess. Subtle and unfathomable, it is called the "valley spirit." The female gives birth to things, as in the previous chapter’s "mother." Calling it the "Mysterious Female" also conveys its profound, unfathomable nature. Xue Juncai says: Laozi’s text often varies its phrasing to harmonize rhyme, not to derive meaning from individual characters. For example, in "是谓玄牝," *pin* (female) is read as *bin* to rhyme with the preceding line. When it says "玄牝之门," the extra word is added to rhyme with the following line. Some interpretations arise from the flow of language, but if one both rhymes *xuanpin* and then designates a specific place as the "gate of the Mysterious Female," this is mistaken.

**Su Zhe’s Commentary:** The valley is utterly empty yet still has form; the valley spirit is empty and formless. Empty and formless, it has no being—how could it have death? Calling it the "valley spirit" describes its virtue; calling it the "Mysterious Female" describes its function. The female gives birth to the myriad things, yet it is called "mysterious" because one sees that it gives birth but not how it does so. The "gate of the Mysterious Female" means the myriad things emerge from it. The "root of Heaven and Earth" means Heaven and Earth arise from it. "Subtle, it seems to endure"—subtle and unceasing. "Seems to endure"—existing yet not visibly so. If one can be thus, though using it all day, one does not labor.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:** The valley has form. Because it attains the One, it is empty yet able to be full. Spirit has no form. Because it attains the One, it is still yet able to be numinous. If one can hold to the center and attain the One, the body with form can be made empty like a valley, and the mind without form can be made still like spirit. Then form and formlessness merge, and one does not die. The ancients spoke of the body uniting with the mind, the mind with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, and spirit with nothingness—this is correct. United, one does not die; not dying, one does not live. Not living, one can give life—this is called the Mysterious Female. "Mysterious" is the union of being and non-being; "female" is that which gives life. Thus it says, "The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female." The Dao’s generation of Heaven and Earth arises from this alone. Thus it says, "The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth." If one thinks it perishes, it is subtle and never ceases; if one thinks it endures, how can one perceive its endurance? It seems to endure yet is not enduring; it seems to perish yet is not perishing. Thus, in using and preserving it, one remains effortless, perfectly attuned—what labor is there?

**Du Daojian’s Commentary:** The *Liezi* also contains this chapter, but it does not attribute it to Laozi, instead calling it a text of the Yellow Emperor. This shows that Laozi’s *Five Thousand Characters* draws extensively from ancient classics and sayings. For example, phrases in the text like "Therefore the sage," "The ancients said," "It is said," "The military has its sayings"—all clarify that he is transmitting the words of ancient sages. Thus Confucius "transmitted but did not create," and in this, Laozi may be compared to him. Only those who trust and love antiquity can discuss this Dao.

Heaven is long, Earth is enduring.
The reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring
Is that they do not live for themselves—
Thus they can live long.
Therefore the sage
Places himself last and finds himself first,
Sets himself aside and finds himself preserved.
Is it not because he is selfless
That he can fulfill himself?

**Su Zhe’s Commentary:** Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they have not transcended form and number, so their long endurance is still measurable. Yet Laozi speaks of long endurance in terms of Heaven and Earth because he is referring to what humans perceive. As for the ultimate in long endurance, it is what he calls "the beginning of Heaven and Earth." Heaven and Earth give life to things but do not live for themselves, standing beyond the myriad things—thus they live long. The sage places himself last and puts others first, sets himself aside and benefits others, standing beyond the crowd—thus he finds himself first and preserved. If Heaven and Earth competed with things for life, and the sage vied with people for gain, then Heaven and Earth would be but one thing, and the sage but one person—how could they surpass others? Though their selflessness is not aimed at fulfilling themselves, fulfillment naturally follows—this is the Dao.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:** "Long" pertains to form; "enduring" pertains to time. Heaven moves through time, so "long" is insufficient for its form—thus it is called "long." Earth moves through form, so "enduring" is insufficient for its time—thus it is called "enduring." The root of Heaven and Earth emerges from the Mysterious Female; the essence of the Mysterious Female resides in the valley spirit’s not dying. Not dying, it does not live; not living, it can give life. The reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves—thus they live long. This is like the valley spirit. Then how can the sage consider his body a burden? It is due to necessity that things cannot stop him. Thus it says, "Places himself last and finds himself first." Standing in nothingness, things cannot harm him—thus it says, "Sets himself aside and finds himself preserved." The body is one’s private concern. Placing himself last and setting himself aside, he is public and selfless—yet it is through selflessness that he fulfills himself.

**Cheng Ju’s Discussion:** Heaven, Earth, and humans share a single origin. What makes Heaven Heaven, Earth Earth, and humans human is fundamentally the same. Yet Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring, while humans alone cannot—why? Heaven does not know it is Heaven; Earth does not know it is Earth. Once one receives form and becomes human, one clings to it as "me"—"me," one says. Believing one cannot live without things, one pursues endless desires. Believing one cannot but cherish the body, one schemes for its adornment. Indulging life, life is harmed; nurturing the body, the body falls ill. To not become a prematurely dead Heaven is already fortunate. Laozi’s teaching is thus, yet those who do not reflect on it assume the followers of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi are all fear death and seek long life—how deluded!

Man, possessing no Way of life—where can he find support? Yet those in the world who ruin their lives do so precisely by treating their existence as a burden. Even those who possess life are deeply cautioned against by Laozi—how much more so those who seek life outside the Dao? They have not reflected on this.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
The Way of Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s generation—Heaven and Earth never for a day cease their giving. Their bestowal of things is unceasing; their generation of things, unfathomable. Heaven does not cherish its bestowal; Earth does not rest its generation. This is called "not living for oneself." Because it does not live for itself, the myriad things rely on it to live—thus it attains long life. The sage is likewise: knowing this heart does not change or decay, vast and flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth, he finds nothing in this body worth cherishing. The movement of this single heart knows no action that is not good, no conduct that is not beneficial. Because he takes what is not the body as the body, none in the world who possess a body can compare to him. This is called "putting the self last, yet the self comes first; treating the self as external, yet the self endures." What prevents people from perfecting things is their self-interest. I have no self-interest, thus I can perfect the self-interest of others. Things attain their self-interest; I attain my attainment. This is called "mutual attainment."

**Supreme goodness is like water.**
Water benefits the myriad things yet contends not;
it dwells where the multitude abhor,
thus it is close to the Dao.
In dwelling, it is good at abiding in the earth;
in the heart, it is good at depth;
in giving, it is good at benevolence;
in speech, it is good at trustworthiness;
in governance, it is good at order;
in affairs, it is good at ability;
in movement, it is good at timing.
Only by not contending does it remain free from blame.

**Su’s Annotation:**
The *Yi* says: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao. What continues it is goodness; what completes it is nature." It also says: "Heaven uses the One to generate water." The Dao moves and becomes goodness, just as qi moves and generates water. Thus it is said: "Supreme goodness is like water." Both begin from nothing and take form, so their principles are the same. The Dao is present everywhere, benefiting all without exception—and water is likewise. Yet once bound to form, it becomes distinct from the Dao. Thus it is said to be "close to the Dao." However, no goodness can be named that surpasses this. Thus it is called "supreme goodness." Avoiding the high and tending toward the low, it never opposes—this is good at abiding in the earth. Empty, still, and silent, deep and unfathomable—this is good at depth. Benefiting and moistening the myriad things, giving without seeking repayment—this is good at benevolence. Round, it must revolve; square, it must turn; blocked, it must halt; unblocked, it must flow—this is good at trustworthiness. Washing and cleansing all things, leveling high and low—this is good at order. Encountering things, it takes their form yet does not linger in one—this is good at ability. Freezing in winter, melting in spring, drying up or overflowing without losing its season—this is good at timing. Though possessing goodness, it is not immune to human fault—because it contends. Water alone does not contend, thus it combines the seven virtues without blame.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The *Commentary* says: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao. What continues it is goodness." To call it "continuation" is already to depart from the Dao and no longer be its essence. "Supreme goodness" refers to the goodness spoken of by the Dao—not the goodness that all under Heaven recognize as good. Thus it is like water. Water benefits the myriad things yet contends not; it dwells where the multitude abhor—and supreme goodness is likewise. Though not yet sufficient to be the Dao, it is close to the Dao. The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they lower themselves. Thus, in dwelling, it is good at abiding in the earth. Still water is deep; flowing water is deep—thus, in the heart, it is good at depth. It pours forth without filling, is drawn from without being exhausted—thus, in giving, it is good at benevolence. Traveling through peril without losing its trustworthiness—thus, in speech, it is good at trustworthiness. Its branches become streams and valleys; its end becomes ditches and seas—thus, in governance, it is good at order. Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it—thus, in affairs, it is good at ability. The source springs forth ceaselessly day and night, filling the hollows before advancing—thus, in movement, it is good at timing. In sum, it arises from not contending, and its foundation is dwelling in the good earth. Thus it is said: "Only by not contending can none in the world contend with it," and so it remains free from blame.

**Wu’s Annotation:**
"Supreme goodness is like water"—water’s goodness lies in its irrigation and cleansing, benefiting the myriad things without contention. While others seek the high and pure, it dwells in the low and filthy places the multitude abhor—thus it is close to the goodness of those with the Dao. The multitude’s goodness lies in dwelling where they deem good, their hearts’ goodness in stillness and depth, their giving’s goodness in befriending the benevolent, their speech’s goodness in trustworthiness, their governance’s goodness in order, their affairs’ goodness in ability, their movement’s goodness in timing. All seven virtues are chosen from what the multitude prefer—this can be called goodness, but not supreme goodness. Only the supreme goodness of those with the Dao does not contend, willingly dwelling below, resembling water. Thus no one blames it. *You* means resentment and fault. The multitude abhor dwelling below and prefer dwelling above, seeking to surpass others—this is contention, and contention brings blame.

**Hongfu’s Annotation:**
Of all goodness in the world, none is as good as water—how then is the sage’s goodness like it? Generally, what benefits things may not be able to do so without contention, and what can avoid contention may not necessarily moisten things. Water’s goodness is precisely its benefiting the myriad things without contention. How is its non-contention evident? While others dwell above, it alone dwells below; while others dwell high, it alone dwells low; while others dwell in ease, it alone dwells in peril; while others dwell in compliance, it may dwell in opposition; while others dwell in purity, it may dwell in filth. Its dwelling is entirely where others abhor—who would contend with it? Without contention, there is no blame. This is why it is called supreme goodness. The seven lines from "dwelling in the good earth" all describe the sage’s benefiting the myriad things without contention.

**Holding and filling it, it is better to stop.**
Sharpening and honing it, it cannot be preserved long.
When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.
Wealth and honor with arrogance—one brings misfortune upon oneself.
When merit is achieved and fame attained, withdraw the self—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

Su Ziyou’s Annotation:
To know that fullness must overflow and thus hold it fast is not as secure as not being full at all. To know that sharpness must break and thus measure it beforehand is to not know that such measurement cannot be relied upon. As for the sage, possessing yet not possessing—how could there be fullness? Following principle and then acting—how could there be sharpness? Without fullness, there is no need to hold; without sharpness, there is no need to measure. The sun at its zenith shifts; the moon at its fullness wanes. The revolutions of the four seasons and the departure of those who have accomplished merit—even Heaven and Earth must yield to this, how much more so for man?

Lü Huiqing’s Annotation:
Holding is meant to prevent overflow, yet filling it only compounds the overflow. If one wishes to avoid overflow, it is as if one should not fill it at all—thus it is said, "Holding and filling it, it is better to stop." Measuring is meant to anticipate loss, yet sharpening it only compounds the loss. If one wishes to avoid loss, it is as if one should not sharpen it at all—thus it is said, "Sharpening and honing it, it cannot be preserved long." To be full yet not overflow is how to long preserve wealth; holding and filling it leads to halls filled with gold and jade that none can guard. To be exalted yet not imperiled is how to long preserve honor; sharpening and honing it leads to wealth and honor with arrogance—one brings misfortune upon oneself. How then to avoid this calamity? Simply follow the Dao of Heaven. For when merit is achieved and fame attained, withdraw the self—this is the Dao of Heaven, and herein lies the absence of self-interest that accomplishes one’s private good. The border guard’s admonition to Yao—"Withdraw yourself"—is this not what it means to follow the Dao of Heaven?

Yuan Ze’s Annotation:
Holding and filling it arises from the intention to possess, and thus one loses it. Only by forgetting that possession is possession and possessing it as if it were not possessed can one avoid loss and overflow. Measuring is skill in assessing circumstances; sharpness is advantage in engaging with things. Yet things are inexhaustible, and if one confronts their changes with a single self, the skill of measuring and sharpening will at times be confounded—how can it be preserved long? Thus, the perfected person follows the moment and rides the principle, meeting all with selflessness. Their emergence is without fixed direction, and their responses are inexhaustible. Cold and heat alternate; when things reach their extreme, they return. Yin and yang succeed one another—this is the inherent pattern of Heaven’s Dao. Yet the foolish of the world, once they encounter change or once they attain a name, cling to it for life, taking it as their own, never realizing the subtle shifts of creation or the hidden interdependence of fortune and misfortune. Thus, they end by sitting in vigilance against calamity, with no means to sustain themselves. Only the perfected person is not thus: they store gold and jade yet do not treasure them; they dwell in wealth and honor yet do not glory in them. Whatever comes to lodge with them—like shadows gathering on the body—is met with profound indifference, unaware whether it lies in the other or in the self. How then could they hold fullness as caution or measure sharpness as skill? If not for the subtlety of selflessness, how could one attain this? The Dao of Heaven is vast—nothing surpasses it.

Liu Shili’s explanation:
["When full, it must empty—beware of fulfillment.
When sharp, it must dull—beware of advancement.
Gold and jade will encumber—beware of greed.
Wealth and honor breed excess—beware of arrogance.
Success achieved and fame attained bring peril—
only in knowing when to stop can one not lose the upright."
These words deeply seek to save others, for one need not dwell in mountains and forests, cutting off human affairs, to enter the Dao. Even amidst success, fame, wealth, and honor, one may diligently practice it.]

Xi Zhai’s annotation:
[To know fullness and yet hold to it is not as good as never having been full.
To know sharpness and yet measure it is not as fitting as never having been sharp.
To know fullness and hold to it, to know sharpness and measure it—this is already not good,
how much worse to be full and not hold, sharp and not measure?
Fullness breeds greater greed; sharpness breeds greater pride.
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet one knows no limit.
Wealth and honor breed arrogance, but before one can make others proud, one’s own heart is already lost—
this is to invite one’s own fault.
The turning of the four seasons: when achievement is complete, it retreats.
Such is the Dao of Heaven—how much more so for humans?]

"Can you load your vital essence and embrace the One without separation?
Can you concentrate your qi and attain suppleness like a newborn child?"

"Can you cleanse and purify your profound vision without flaw?
Can you love the people and govern the state without action?
Can you open and close the gates of Heaven while remaining receptive?
Can you comprehend the four directions without knowledge?

It gives life and nurtures,
gives life yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
leads yet does not dominate—
this is called profound virtue.

[載 means "to carry" or "to bear." 营 resembles the movement of managing or encircling, as in the *Baihutong*, where it describes an unsettled appearance. Though 营魄 may seem stagnant, to "carry and bear" it implies non-attachment. To gloss 营 as "hun-soul" or as "defense" does not align well with the meaning; while "hun carries po" is plausible, the text does not say "hun carries po" but "carries 营魄," leaving later readers no way to discern its intent as referring to the hun-soul. Moreover, to set one against the other and divide them contradicts the caution of embracing the One. 涤 means cleansing like water, 除 means removing like waste. 天门 refers to this heart-mind; 开阖 describes the movement and transformation of the heart-mind. *Zhuangzi* says, "Entering and exiting without revealing its form"—this is called the gate of Heaven. 畜 is read as *xù* in the sixth tone, meaning "to nurture." 长 is read in the upper tone, meaning "to lead" or "to dominate."]"

Su's Annotation:
What distinguishes *po* from *hun* is that *po* pertains to the material while *hun* pertains to the spirit. The *Yijing* states, "Essence and *qi* constitute things; the wandering *hun* effects transformation." Thus we know the conditions of ghosts and spirits: *po*, being material, is mixed and stationary; *hun*, being spirit, is unified and transformative. To speak of "carrying *yingpo*" is to speak of its station. The Dao is omnipresent; in humans, it is called nature, and the marvel of nature is spirit. When pure and undivided, it is called the One; when gathered and undispersed, it is called the Uncarved Block—all ultimately return to the Dao, each described according to its reality.

The sage’s nature is settled and spirit congealed, unshaken by things. Though *po* serves as its dwelling, wherever the spirit wishes to go, *po* follows without fail—thus the spirit constantly carries *po*. The common people, enslaved by things, suffer a clouded spirit that cannot govern itself; then the spirit listens to *po*. Eyes and ears are wearied by sounds and colors; nose and mouth are taxed by scents and flavors. Wherever *po* wishes to go, the spirit follows—thus *po* constantly carries the spirit. Therefore, the teaching is to embrace the spirit and carry *po*, so the two do not separate. This is indeed the essence of the sage’s self-cultivation. As for the ancients’ "true persons" who "deepened their roots and firmed their stems" to "live long and see far," their Way likewise proceeded from this.

When the spirit is ungoverned, *qi* becomes chaotic: the strong delight in fighting, the weak in fear, all unconsciously. When the spirit is governed, *qi* does not act recklessly; joy and anger each follow their measure—this is called "focusing *qi*." The ultimate in spirit’s emptiness is softness; the beginning of *qi*’s fullness is hardness. To purify one’s nature and eliminate *qi* is called "attaining softness." The infant knows neither good nor evil; thus its nature is whole, its *qi* subtle, its body soft. To focus *qi* and attain softness like an infant is the utmost. The sage, outwardly not carried by *po* and inwardly not driven by *qi*, has cleansed and removed all dust and grime. Then the spirit, vast and darkly perceptive, knows all things as issuing from nature, viewing purity and filth equally without blemish.

Having cultivated the self, one extends the surplus to others. Though governing the people and ordering the state, one meets all with non-interference. If one acts with intention, then loving the people harms them, and ordering the state disorders it. The "Gate of Heaven" is the source of order and disorder, rise and decline. Having taken the world upon oneself, when the gate opens and closes, when changes and transformations occur, the common people value gain and fear loss, seeking blessings by acting preemptively. The sage follows principle and understands Heaven’s decree, waiting for the song before harmonizing. The *Yijing* says, "Preceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose; following Heaven, one complies with its timing"—not that one truly precedes or follows Heaven, but that one’s actions always accord with Heaven’s decree. Otherwise, those who act early will be premature, those who act late will be tardy—all will miss the mark. Thus, what is called "being able to be the female" is merely not losing the proper time. Inwardly for self-cultivation, outwardly for governing the state, facing change—there is a Way for all. How could one do this without being "lucid and penetrating"?

"Lucid and penetrating" describes the heart-mind. This heart-mind knows all things yet never possesses a heart-mind that knows. The great heart-mind is simply One; if there were another that knows, then it would be two. From One to two, delusion arises, and stupidity begins. Now, a mirror responds to things as they come—nothing more. How could it know the one that responds to things? Originally, there is nothing; to impose intention upon it is the source of delusion. The Dao suffices to give life to and nurture the myriad things, yet it does not possess, does not rely, does not dominate. Though it possesses great virtue, things do not recognize it. Thus it is called "dark virtue."

Lu's Annotation:
People have possessed their bodies for a long time, yet to desire to withdraw and embody Heaven’s Way without being burdened by merit or fame—is this not difficult? Yet there is a Way.

At the inception of human life, it is called *po*; when *po* unites with essence, there is only stillness. Once *po* is born, yang is called *hun*; *hun* and spirit come and go, while *po* guards the ingress and egress of essence—thus *po* develops fissures and ceases to nurture. Once separated, they no longer embrace.

"Carrying" refers to the cyclical end and beginning; "nurturing" refers to the seamless encircling. Though one has already become human, if in carrying and nurturing the *po*, embracing the One, one remains profoundly inactive, as at life’s inception, then one can avoid separation. Able to avoid separation, one concentrates *qi* without division, attains suppleness without resistance, and can become like an infant. Able to become like an infant, one washes away regrets and resentments, gazes into the mysterious and observes the subtle—every slightest movement, I necessarily know, yet remain without flaw.

Thus, in cultivating the inner, though one loves the people and governs the state, one is not burdened by affairs and can practice non-action. Within, one washes away and gazes into the mysterious without flaw; without, one loves the people and governs the state through non-action—then the Gate of Heaven opens and closes always at my command, and one can act as the feminine. Neither pursuing nor welcoming, responding without hoarding, one becomes luminous and all-pervading, yet able to be without knowledge. When the Dao reaches the point of no-knowledge, this is true knowledge—this is how one’s human form becomes Heaven.

What burden of merit or fame could there be? To give life and nurture, to give life yet not possess, to act yet not rely, to lead yet not dominate—this is how one becomes Heaven. Dark virtue is none other than the virtue of Heaven.

The Xizhai Annotation states:
At inception, there is construction—*hun* is the yang of a person, *po* the yin. From the first formation of *po*, it embraces *hun*; within *po*, it enables *hun* and *po* to embrace as one, never to part. The infant’s yang *qi* has not dispersed; within, it harmonizes with softness. This is not the infant’s own ability but the effect of concentrating *qi*. Without seeking attainment, attainment comes—thus, concentrating *qi* achieves harmony, unity without admixture. Can one be like a child?

Transcendent and mysterious observation is not without merit, yet if this heart is not forgotten, it is insufficient to speak of the Dao. Therefore, one must wash away and gaze into the mysterious without flaw. To love the people with love is to begin with all-encompassing care; to govern the state with affairs is to begin with disorder. With clarity and stillness, one presides over the people, and they transform themselves—thus, one can practice non-action.

Yang moves and opens; yin is still and closes. From this alternation of opening and closing, transformations emerge. Yet ceaseless movement must reach exhaustion; ceasing movement and guarding stillness nurtures the dynamic—thus, one can act as the feminine.

Within and without, luminous and clear; the center, utterly open. Though not engaging in affairs or action, one may still be burdened by the dust of stillness. Only by knowing the self as no-self can one know that nothing is an obstacle—thus, one can be without knowledge.

The sage, in relation to things, gives life as a parent and nurtures as a child or grandchild—giving life yet not claiming possession, acting yet not relying on it as merit, leading yet not assuming mastery. Without embodying dark virtue, this cannot be achieved.

The Hongfu Annotation states:
People know that *po* carries the spirit, yet do not know that the spirit carries *po*. When *po* carries the spirit, the spirit is cultivated; when the spirit carries *po*, it is not spirit—yet it is one spirit. Alas!

To embrace the Origin and guard the One is for spirit and *po* to naturally remain undivided—thus one may come to know what spirit truly is. The *ying* and *wei* circulate as protectors. The infant knows nothing, yet its qi is utterly focused; it can do nothing, yet its qi is utterly supple. To focus the qi and attain suppleness, to be as an infant—this is to embrace the One.

If flaws remain unwashed away, the Gate of the Mysterious will not open; if the Gate of the Mysterious does not open, form and substance remain obstructed. Only by cleansing and beholding the Mysterious, attaining flawlessness, can one embrace the One.

To love the people and govern the state—who but spirit could accomplish this? Yet one cannot do so through non-action. Thus, those who know to embrace the One do not divide their minds to love the people, while those who strive to love the people inevitably exhaust their spirit to govern the state—this is duality. How can one embrace the One without separation?

The opening and closing of the Gate of Heaven—who but spirit could preside over it? Yet one cannot master it oneself. Thus, when it opens, it rises of its own accord without compulsion; when it closes, it remains settled without disturbance—this is inner dissipation. How can one embrace the One without separation?

This arises from nothing other than ignorance of what spirit does. Spirit is utterly empty—emptiness is naturally luminous and clear. Spirit is utterly numinous—numinosity is naturally all-pervading. Who could separate from it? Yet precisely because it has knowledge, it is only through non-knowledge that one may know it. With knowledge, *po* carries spirit; without knowledge, spirit carries *po*. When spirit carries *po*, there is oneness; when *po* carries spirit, there is duality. Thus, one must not rely on knowledge, nor can one be without it. To know this is to embody dark virtue.

Dark virtue runs deep and far. Therefore, it can give life but cannot be possessed; it can act but cannot be relied upon as merit; it can lead but cannot be mastered. Alas! This is its fullness.

The *Brush Jottings*:

In ancient times, *hun* and *po* were sometimes spoken of as one. The *Zuozhuan* states: "The essence and clarity of the heart—this is called *hun* and *po*." At other times, they were spoken of as distinct. The *Zuozhuan* says: "At the beginning of human life, the transformation is called *po*; once *po* is born, the yang is called *hun*."

Generally, when clear and empty, *po* becomes *hun*; when attached and fixed, *hun* becomes *po*. It is like water congealing into ice or melting back into water—essentially, they are one and the same.

Now, *po* busies itself daily, tending toward existence. Yet when it is said to "carry," this means knowing that the seven emotions have no substance and the four great elements are fundamentally empty—like a person riding a carriage, a boat, or water, drifting without destination.

Thus, transforming existence into nothingness, cleansing emotions to return to nature: the multitude separates them into two, while I alone embrace them as one. What could be more essential to entering the Dao than this?

"Concentrating qi to attain suppleness"—Laozi said: "When the heart commands qi, it is called force." Zhuangzi said: "Do not listen with the heart but listen with qi." Qi is emptiness that awaits things.

The heart has judgments of right and wrong; qi makes no distinctions. Thus, when the heart commands qi, it is forceful. Concentrating on qi without the heart’s interference makes one supple. This is what is meant by "guarding the purity of qi." Who but an infant could achieve this? It is the vision of the *Profound Mirror* and the *Mysterious Wondrous*.

Flaws and illnesses:
The flaws of the multitude are coarse and easily removed; the flaws of the scholar are subtle and difficult to dispel. Why? What the Dao calls a flaw, the scholar clings to as unique insight.

Gold dust, though fine, becomes a film in the eye. Taking awareness as an obstacle and understanding as a defense—how can one not be afflicted? Therefore, one must cleanse and remove them.

Laozi’s teachings to humanity could not be more thorough.

Yet the wise eliminate the heart but not affairs, while the deluded eliminate affairs but not the heart. Should one misconstrue the earlier words and mistake restraint for the scholar’s defense, Laozi further clarifies:

When I speak of "bearing the *po* and *hun*," I do not mean mere silent inaction—it is loving the people and governing the state while practicing non-action. This is what is meant by "acting through non-action."

When I speak of "concentrating qi to attain suppleness," I do not mean stifling closure—it is the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate while abiding as the feminine. This is what is meant by "the masculine guarding the feminine."

When I speak of "cleansing to reveal the *Profound Mirror*," I do not mean obscuring darkness—it is clarity extending in all four directions while embodying unknowing. This is what is meant by "knowing the unknowing."

Loving the people and governing the state, the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate, clarity extending in all four directions—none of these abandon the nurturing, rearing, leading, and maturing of life. Yet through non-action, abiding as the feminine, and unknowing, one gives life without possession, acts without reliance, and leads without domination. What is this if not *profound virtue*?

Guan Yinzi said: "Within oneself, take no residence, and the forms of things will naturally manifest."
Zhuangzi said: "Laozi takes emptiness and non-destruction of the myriad things as the true reality." His intent is abundantly clear.

Those who dismiss Laozi claim he abandons the practical affairs of humanity to rely solely on emptiness and nothingness. They have not examined his words but first imposed their bias to slander him—how could this not be delusional?

】Thirty spokes unite in a single hub—it is where there is nothing that the use of the cart lies. Clay is shaped to form a vessel—it is where there is nothing that the use of the vessel lies. Doors and windows are cut to make a room—it is where there is nothing that the use of the room lies. Thus, what is present is considered advantageous, but it is where there is nothing that the function resides.【*Gǔ* (毂): pronounced as "gǔ" in ancient wood rhyme, the part of the wheel where the spokes converge. The *Kao Gong Ji* states: "The *gǔ* is that by which the wheel turns to advantage." *Dāng* (当): pronounced in level tone. *Shān* (埏): pronounced as "shī rán." *Zhí* (埴): pronounced as "shì lì." The *Kao Gong Ji* states: "*Shān* is the blending of clay; it is kneaded with water and earth, then fired to make pottery." A single door is called a *hù* (户); a window is called a *yǒu* (牖).】

Su Ziyou’s commentary:【Exhausting knowledge and employing things to make vessels, the function of the vessel always lies in the nothingness within. Without the presence of something, there would be no nothingness to achieve its function; without nothingness, there would be no presence to apply its advantage. Thus, the sage constantly observes the wondrous in nothingness and the boundary in presence. Knowing that the two are one and indivisible—this is perfection.】

Lü’s commentary:【Thirty spokes unite in a single hub—it is where there is nothing that the use of the cart lies. The cart is what I ride. Clay is shaped to form a vessel—it is where there is nothing that the use of the vessel lies. The vessel is what I use. Doors and windows are cut to make a room—it is where there is nothing that the use of the room lies. The room is where I dwell. When riding, one observes the cart’s use; when using, one observes the vessel’s function; when dwelling, one observes the room’s purpose. Their function is never not in nothingness, and the principle is not far. Yet when it comes to the self, one does not know: what is it that I employ? Thus, what is present is considered advantageous, and it is where there is nothing that the function resides. If presence alone were advantageous and nothingness had no function, then what is called advantage would be abandoned and unused. If nothingness alone had function and presence had no advantage, then what is called function would become harmful and not advantageous. Therefore, the sage enters without ever possessing things—this is how nothingness achieves its function. The sage emerges without ever lacking things—this is how presence secures its advantage. Hence it is said: "Refining wisdom to the spiritual to achieve function; utilizing advantage to secure the self and exalt virtue."】

Wu's Annotation:
The spokes are the flanges of the wheel, the hub its center—where there is no hollow emptiness. *Shan* means to mix earth; *zhi* refers to the sticky clay used to make vessels, meaning to blend water with adhesive clay to form pottery. Generally, in front of a house lies the eastern door and western window: doors serve for entry and exit, windows for light and air. Carts bear heavy loads and travel far; vessels store goods; rooms provide dwelling—thus, these carts, vessels, and rooms all serve to benefit the world. Hence it is said: "Presence is for advantage." Yet without the hollow emptiness of the hub and linchpin, the axle cannot turn, and the cart cannot traverse the earth. Without the hollow emptiness within, a vessel cannot hold things. Without the hollow emptiness of doors and windows, a room cannot allow entry, exit, or illumination. The cart’s function lies in turning the axle; the vessel’s in containing objects; the room’s in enabling passage and light—all residing in emptiness. Thus it is said: "Nothingness is for function." The human belly, filled with qi, sustains life—this is what is meant by advantage. The empty heart, devoid of things, generates qi—this is what is meant by function. Therefore, these three objects are taken as analogies.

Xue Juncai’s Exegesis:
Though the chapter alternately discusses presence and nothingness, its intent is to elucidate the value of nothingness through presence. For while all recognize the advantage of presence, the function of nothingness is universally overlooked and unexamined. Thus, Laozi employs these examples to enlighten.

The five colors blind the eye;
The five tones deafen the ear;
The five flavors dull the palate;
Racing and hunting madden the heart;
Rare goods impede conduct.
Therefore, the sage attends to the belly, not the eye—thus discarding that and embracing this.

*(Note: "令" is read in level tone; "爽" in level tone, meaning "difference"; "行" in departing tone.)*
Kumārajīva says: Not knowing the emptiness within form, the emptiness within sound—how does this differ from blindness and deafness? "Attending to the belly" resembles the meaning of "stabilizing the back" in the *Yi Jing*; "not attending to the eye" resembles the *Classic of the Dark Warrior*’s "the mechanism lies in the eye." Li Yue says: The eye is insatiable; the sage does not attend to it. The belly knows contentment; the sage attends to it. The eye gazes outward—hence "that"; the belly is filled within—hence "this."

Su’s Annotation:
Seeing colors, hearing sounds, tasting flavors—all originally arise from nature. When nature is in its pristine state, prior to the existence of things, it is perfect. Yet when the eye clings to the five colors, the ear to the five tones, the mouth to the five flavors, they are seized by their objects and forget their origin. Thus, though one sees, one is truly blind; though one hears, truly deaf; though one tastes, truly dulled. The sage sees colors, hears sounds, and tastes flavors just as others do. As for racing and hunting, they have never refrained from such pursuits; as for rare goods, they have never ceased to use them. Yet while all others deem these harmful, the sage alone regards them as blessings. Why? The sage attends to the belly, while the multitude attends to the eye. The eye is greedy and cannot be satisfied; the belly receives yet is never greedy. Those are things that come from without; this is nature congealed within.

Lü’s Annotation:
What enables the eye to be the eye is color—yet color is not color. When it clings to the five colors, it loses what enables it to be the eye and becomes no different from blindness. The ear...

The ear’s capacity to be the ear lies in sound—yet sound is not sound. When it clings to the five tones, it loses what enables it to be the ear and becomes no different from deafness. The mouth’s capacity to be the mouth lies in flavor—yet flavor is not flavor. When it clings to the five flavors, it loses what enables it to be the mouth and becomes no different from dullness. Nothing in the myriad things can disturb it; this is why the mind is tranquil and sagely. Pursuing externals leads to deluded thoughts and madness. There is nothing that does not follow this principle, yet racing and hunting are especially egregious. Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no danger. This is how one preserves integrity. Seeking externals leads to disgrace, danger, and harm to one’s conduct. There is nothing that does not follow this principle, yet rare goods are especially egregious. The belly is without awareness; the eye possesses perception. Thus the sage attends to the belly, not the eye—abandoning that pursuit of perception and desire to embrace this state of unknowing and desireless emptiness.

Xi Zhai’s Annotation:
The eye can see colors, yet the eye is blinded by color. The ear can hear sounds, yet the ear is deafened by sound. The mouth can taste flavors, yet the mouth is dulled by flavor. Racing, hunting, and the insatiable pursuit of goods all arise from the mind’s capacity to grasp, yet they also arise from that very capacity to destroy. For spirit is stored within, while the ear, eye, mouth, and mind each divide its function—seeing, hearing, tasting, and knowing. If seeing does not transcend color, then color seizes sight. If hearing does not transcend sound, then sound seizes hearing. If tasting is confined to flavor, then flavor seizes the mouth. If knowing is confined to grasping, then grasping seizes the mind. When these four are seized by things, the eye is as if blind, the ear as if deaf.

The mouth is as if numbed, the mind as if maddened. How much better to turn inward and seek it—let seeing not see through color, but let seeing be the eye; let hearing not hear through sound, but let hearing be the ear; let tasting not taste through flavor, but let tasting be the mouth; let knowing not know through the mind, but let knowing be the mind. Thus the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes. The belly receives without grasping, takes in without retaining, and is easily satisfied, free from emotion—not like the eyes, which are never sated, seeing more yet feeling more wanting. The eyes race outward, while the belly rests within. The sage focuses on the inner and forgets the outer, thus abandoning that to take this.

Wu’s commentary: All external desires harm the body. The sage merely fills the belly to nourish himself, not to please the eyes and be enslaved by things. Thus he completely discards those external illusions and solely embraces this inner truth. Above, it speaks of the eye’s blindness, the ear’s deafness, the mouth’s numbness, and the mind’s madness—all obstructing the five senses. Below, it speaks only of not acting for the eyes, taking one to encompass the other four. Dong Sijing said: The previous chapter spoke of the function of emptiness within; this one warns against being filled by external perversions. The eye must see, the ear must hear, the mouth must taste, the form must act, and the mind must perceive—none can be forced to stillness. Only when movement does not depart from stillness can one move without being attached to things, remaining serene and desireless. To be stained by dust and pursue external realms is to lose one’s true nature, and the root of this lies in the eyes—hence it is spoken of from beginning to end. Confucius’s four prohibitions begin with “seeing,” and in Buddhism’s six senses, eye and form come first—all conveying this meaning.

Favor and disgrace are both like shock; valuing great trouble is like valuing the body. What does “favor and disgrace are both like shock” mean? Favor is inferior: gaining it is like shock, losing it is like shock—this is what “favor and disgrace are both like shock” means. What does “valuing great trouble is like valuing the body” mean? The reason I have great trouble is because I have a body. If I had no body, what trouble would I have? Thus, one who values the body as if it were the world can be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes the body as if it were the world can be relied upon with the world.

Su’s commentary: The enlightened of old were shocked by favor as if by disgrace, knowing that favor precedes disgrace. They valued the body as if it were great trouble, knowing that the body is the root of trouble. Thus, they abandoned favor and disgrace did not reach them; they forgot the body and trouble did not arise. What is called “favor and disgrace” are not two separate things—disgrace arises from favor, yet the world does not realize this, taking favor as superior and disgrace as inferior. If one knows that disgrace arises from favor, then favor is inherently inferior. Thus, the enlightened of old gained favor as if shocked, lost favor as if shocked, never resting in favor or being shocked by disgrace. What is called “as if shocked” is not truly shocked—merely appearing so. “Valuing” means difficulty. The body is the root of great trouble, yet the world’s scholars find it difficult to endure great trouble but not difficult to possess a body. Therefore, the sage, knowing their difficulty in enduring trouble, teaches them the difficulty of having a body. Once they know the difficulty of having a body, great trouble departs. Human nature cannot be increased by life or diminished by death; its greatness can fill heaven and earth, its essence can tread water and fire, enter metal and stone—no thing can trouble it. Yet the world constantly suffers the loss of its original nature, seeing only the body and loving it deeply, so that things begin to trouble it. Changes like life and death, illness and disease attack from within; encounters like favor and disgrace, gain and loss assail from without—there is not a single thing that is not trouble. Only the enlightened know that nature cannot be harmed while the body is not real. Suddenly forgetting the body, all troubles in the world vanish, and then one can engage with the world without burden. People chase after power and profit, drown in wealth and nobility, face danger without regret—all to enrich their bodies. Now, if one is entrusted with the world and charged with its weight, yet forgets the body to this extent, then even the greatness of the world cannot trouble them.

Lü’s commentary: Favor is what one is kept by; it is the lower Way. If one possesses favor, then disgrace follows. The reason I have disgrace is because I have shock—if I had not gained it, I would be shocked by gaining it; if I had gained it, I would be shocked by losing it. If I had no shock, what disgrace would I have? Thus, the disgrace that comes with favor is merely like this. Valuing is what keeps others; it is the higher Way. If one possesses valuing, then trouble follows. The reason I have great trouble is because I have a body—fortune is my trouble, misfortune is my trouble. If I had no body, what trouble would I have? Thus, the great trouble that comes with valuing is merely like this. Speaking of the body reveals that shock is of the mind; speaking of shock reveals that the body is a burden. Without the mind, there is no shock; without shock, there is no disgrace. Without the body, there is no burden; without burden, there is no trouble. In the past, Shun befriended the Son of Heaven as a common man—this could be called favor, yet he treated it as if it were nothing—what disgrace could there be? Towering above, possessing the world could be called valuing, yet he did not consider himself as possessing it—what great trouble could there be? Thus, one who values the body as if it were the world can be entrusted with the world. If favor brings disgrace, then one demeans the body and cannot be entrusted with the world. If valuing brings trouble, then one endangers the body and cannot be relied upon with the world. Only one who possesses favor without being possessed by it, possesses valuing without being possessed by it—like Shun—can truly be entrusted with the world.

Yuanze’s commentary: Valuing means being above things and possessing a state, yet if one cannot forget it, then trouble is great. It is like a person having a body and cherishing it—cold and heat, illness and pain, a thousand threads all arise—is this not great trouble? The Master of the Southern Market said: Yao was not possessed by others, nor did he appear to be possessed by others. Those who value are possessed by others; those who are favored appear to be possessed by others. Only the sage can avoid these two. When the myriad things and I are one, then one is in harmony with the profound Dao, and the ten thousand changes are all forgotten—good and ill cease. Yet the foolish cannot free themselves, clinging to form as self. Thus, whatever the form encounters, trouble arises along the way. Laozi first clarifies the burdens of favor and valuing, and these burdens all arise from having a body. Hence, he uses the analogy of valuing as if it were the body and proceeds to the wonder of having no body. Zhuangzi said: “Forget what should not be forgotten, and do not forget what should be forgotten”—this is called true forgetting, also clarifying this meaning. Confucius’s “Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire” shares the same principle. The goal of learning lies in this alone. Yet what is called “having no body” does not mean casting it aside and abandoning it.

Yet to possess while never truly possessing—this is not burdensome. Moreover, nothing is more exalted than wealth and honor. If one can hold them as if holding nothing, then this is how the sage serves the world—what trouble could there be? As for favor, it is no different.

*Brush Jottings* states: Human nature invariably esteems favor and despises disgrace, not realizing that disgrace does not arise on its own but is born of favor. Thus, favor becomes disgrace. Since favor is but disgrace, to gain or lose it is equally startling—startled because one is touched by things yet unattached to them. When the touch passes, emptiness remains.

To value and honor is to deem something difficult. Human nature invariably clings to the body and fears suffering, not realizing that suffering does not arise on its own but is born of the body. Without this body, there would be no suffering. From this, we see that the world’s esteem for favor is in truth esteem for disgrace. If alarm at favor and disgrace is the same, what disgrace remains? To have a body is to have great suffering. If valuing the body and valuing suffering are the same, what suffering remains?

One who does not regard the body as the body but regards it as great suffering—this is to have no body. Only then can one be free of suffering. This is what is meant by "putting the self last, yet the self comes first; setting the self aside, yet the self endures."

To put it another way: one who does not lightly offer the self for the world finds the world can be entrusted to them; one who cherishes the self for the world finds the world can be relied upon. Thus, we know that not possessing the self ensures the self is preserved.

Zhuangzi said: The people of Yue assassinated their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, fearing this, fled into a cinnabar cave. The people of Yue smoked him out with mugwort, then bore him away in the royal carriage. Prince Sou grasped the reins, mounted the chariot, and looking to heaven, cried: "Ruler! Ruler! Could you not spare me alone?"

Prince Sou did not despise being a ruler—he despised the perils of rulership. This was precisely what the people of Yue desired: to be their ruler. Yet the more Prince Sou shunned the throne, the more the people of Yue pressed him to take it. Thus, not possessing the self ensures the self is preserved—what doubt remains?

Look for it and it cannot be seen—this is called "the Level."
Listen for it and it cannot be heard—this is called "the Rare."
Grasp for it and it cannot be held—this is called "the Subtle."
These three cannot be fathomed, so they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark.
Endless, unceasing—it cannot be named, yet returns to nothingness.
This is called the formless form, the imageless image—what we call "elusive and evanescent."
Approach it and you do not see its head; follow it and you do not see its tail.
Hold fast to the ancient Dao to steer the present realm.
To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.

The graspable, too—merged into one.
To see, use the eyes; to hear, use the ears; to grasp, use the heart—merged into one, then the ears are like the eyes, the eyes like the ears, the heart like the ears and eyes.
Those who lose the Dao see light above and earth below—what I attain is neither.
Above, it is not light, so it is not bright; below, it is not earth, so it is not dark.
Endless, ever-straight—trustworthy, yet though trustworthy, it cannot be named, so it returns to nothingness.
Though nothingness, this is called the formless form, the imageless image—yet it has never been without thingness.
This is called "elusive and evanescent."
Elusive, then not bright; not bright, then suspected of nothingness—yet not nothingness.
Evanescent, then not dark; not dark, then suspected of thingness—yet not thingness.
Its beginning has no prior, so approaching it, you do not see its head; its end has no after, so following it, you do not see its tail.
Without prior, without after—neither ancient nor present.
Though neither ancient nor present, it has never been without ancient and present.
Thus, it is older than high antiquity yet does not age.
I attain it in daily use.
Therefore, it is said: "Hold fast to the ancient Dao to steer the present realm."
The so-called "ancient" is not different from the present—by knowing the ancient’s beginning, one knows the present’s origin.
The so-called "present" is not different from the ancient—by knowing the present’s source, one knows the ancient’s origin.
Truly knowing the ancient’s beginning, one knows the present’s source.
The beginning has no origin, no source—this is called the "thread without end."
The thread is the thread of the Dao.
The Dao cannot be grasped, but attaining this, one may grasp it as virtue.
To grasp virtue is called the thread.

Yuan Ze’s commentary:
These three are originally one body, yet people seek it sometimes by seeing, sometimes by hearing, sometimes by grasping—thus, they force names according to circumstances. Nevertheless, the means of seeking and what is sought have never been separate. Only by realizing our oneness does it merge with that oneness, becoming one. Pushing further to the beginning without beginning, one knows things have no source—thus, the nature of the Dao is attained.

Li Rong’s commentary:
These three—Rare, Subtle, Level—are all beyond sound and form, transcending shape and name. Neither existence nor nonexistence suffices to fathom them; neither length nor shortness can be discussed. Undifferentiated, chaotic—we lodge the name "one." Yet this one does not arise from itself; the three do not arise from the one. Thus, the one arises from the three, and the three arise from the one. The one is three; the three are one. The one does not become one; the three do not become three. The three not becoming three means there are no three; the one not becoming one means there is no one. Without one, without three—naturally harmonizing the principle beyond words. Clinging to three or one obstructs the teaching of mysterious penetration.

Xizhai’s commentary:
Seeing yet not seeing—it cannot be sought by color. Hearing yet not hearing—it cannot be seized by sound. Grasping yet not grasping—it cannot be sought by form. No longer confined by color, form, or vessel, what is called "original clarity" is but a single luminous essence. Before it scatters, merged into one, though lodged in clarity, it cannot be called clear—thus, "above, it is not bright." Though it cannot be called clear, it also cannot be called unclear—thus, "below, it is not dark." Never for a moment can it be separated or abandoned. Therefore, it is said: "Endless, it cannot be named, yet returns to nothingness." Though returning to nothingness, it cannot be called nothingness—thus, "the formless form, the imageless image," called "elusive and evanescent." Elusive and evanescent—entering and exiting, transforming without fixed abode, hence its constancy. Its coming has no beginning, so approaching it, you do not see its head; its going has no end, so following it, you do not see its tail. Try holding fast to the ancient Dao to steer the present realm—then the present is like the ancient. By the present being like the ancient, one knows the ancient is like the present—this is called the "thread of the Dao." The thread of the Dao means no going, no coming—this is the meaning of ancient and present.

The ancients who were good at being scholars were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, deeply unfathomable. Only because they were unfathomable did they force themselves to adopt appearances:
Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;
Cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;
Reserved, as if a guest;
Dispersing, as if ice about to melt;
Simple, as if uncarved wood;
Vast, as if a valley;
Turbid, as if muddy.
Who can make the turbid still and slowly clear?
Who can make the tranquil stir and slowly come to life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Only by not being full can they be worn yet not newly made.

Those who act only after caution are called "prepared"—what they desire to do is compelled yet responsive, prepared as if crossing a river in winter, hesitating as if unable to proceed. Those who do not act due to doubt are called "hesitant"—what they do not desire is delayed and resisted, hesitant as if fearing the gaze of neighbors on all sides. Like a guest, they show reverence in all things, never negligent. Like ice about to melt, they know the myriad things arise from delusion and never cling to anything. Like uncarved wood, human artifice is exhausted and their nature restored. Like a valley, they are empty and receptive to all. Like turbid water, they harmonize their light and merge with the dust, not differing from things.

Worldly scholars, drowned by things, become turbid and never clear afterward. Those who wither in stillness extinguish their nature and find peace, never reviving. Now, knowing turbidity disturbs nature, one quiets it—quieting it, it slowly clears. Knowing the extinction of nature is not the Dao, one stirs it—stirring it, it slowly comes to life. The *Yi Jing* says: "Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all causes under heaven." What is called "stirring" here is like this.

Fullness arises from extreme turbidity and cannot clear; from stagnation and cannot live—this is why it is full. No thing does not wear out. Only by not being full does its weariness depart without needing renewal.

Lü’s Commentary:
The ancients who were good at being scholars aimed to become sages and fully realize the spirit. Though they had not yet attained sagehood or spiritual mastery, what enabled them to become sages and fully realize the spirit was already complete within them. Subtle, wondrous, mysterious, and penetrating—deeply unfathomable—this is how they became sages and fully realized the spirit. Subtle, then wondrous; wondrous, then mysterious; mysterious, then penetrating—thus deeply unfathomable. Only by being unfathomable could their appearances not be imitated. They forced themselves to adopt appearances: prepared, like crossing a river in winter, acting only when compelled, rising only when unavoidable; hesitant, like fearing neighbors, guarding against deceit to preserve sincerity, so that if things did not provoke them, their minds did not emerge; reserved, like a guest, not presuming to take the lead; dispersing, like ice about to melt, ending with the heart congealed, form released, flesh and bones fused; simple, like uncarved wood, returning to their origin; vast, like a valley, responsive yet not hoarding; turbid, like muddy water, without distinctions of right and wrong or self and other.

People are all bright—who can make the turbid still and slowly clear? Slowly clearing, nothing is not illuminated. People all seek to be first—who can remain tranquil and slowly come to life? Slowly coming to life, nothing is not brought forth. To still the mind, one must calm the qi; to spiritually transform, one must follow the heart. To act appropriately, one must respond to necessity—calming the qi and following the heart are how one slowly clears. Responding to necessity is how one slowly comes to life. This is how scholars become sages and fully realize the spirit.

The body of the Dao is empty and harmonious, the balance of yin and yang, the preservation of fullness and emptiness. Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—only emptiness. Yet it is not called "emptiness" but "not full" for fear of being burdened by emptiness. Burdened by emptiness, one is not empty. Thus it says: "Perhaps not full." It means not desiring fullness—merely this. All things under heaven are new, then worn; worn, then broken. Few can avoid weariness. Only by not being full do newness, weariness, completion, and ruin find no place in the heart. Thus, though worn, they are not worn; not worn, they do not break; not worn, not broken, they are not new, not complete.

Yuanze’s Commentary:
"Scholar" is the name for one who serves the Dao. Subtle and wondrous, mysterious and penetrating—possessing this Dao, they retreat and conceal it in secrecy. Secrecy lies within the original nature, so no traces are visible. The scholars of that time differed from this. Thus, the ancients who were good at being scholars were called "prepared"—those who caution before acting. The perfect person has no mind for things, yet acts only when compelled. "Crossing in winter" means hesitating before action, as if unable to proceed. *Zhuangzi* says: "Not engaging in affairs, one need not be cautious," yet they are cautious—this is "hesitant." The perfect person is still, secret, deep, and does not emerge from the dwelling of nature, so they are always like one fearing neighbors, restraining their conduct and not indulging. Reserved like a guest, not taking affairs as their own responsibility, their demeanor is tranquil.

At the beginning of human life, all is one with the great emptiness. Congealed into our bodies like water into ice, when matters reach this point, their appearance no longer clings to one form—dispersing, they are about to melt. I have privately considered this: human nature is like water, congealed by creation, thus bound and unflowing. Those who melt return to the origin. Unworked material is called "uncarved wood"—this metaphor describes the wholeness of nature. After the ice melts, one can preserve the wholeness of heavenly nature without being carved by human artifice, thus like uncarved wood. Nature is whole and unharmed, yet does not possess its wholeness, so it is vast and empty like a valley, receptive and responsive.

The nature of water is originally clear, but turbidity arises from mixing with things. The perfect person does not purify themselves apart from things, so they are turbid like muddy water. When the nature is stirred, it becomes increasingly turbid; only by stilling it can it slowly clear. The scholar of the Dao, whom no thing can disturb, does so by stilling and slowly clearing, returning to tranquility. Stimulated, they penetrate all causes, slowly coming to life—thus there is an end and a beginning. Stirring and slowly coming to life, they change and move without abiding—what thing can stop them? Who can make them tranquil? Those who do this trust the principles of yin and yang, ride the movement of nature, and have no mind in between. Thus, all is said to be "slow." Turbidity knows tranquility clears it; tranquility knows movement revives it. This aligns with the previous chapter’s "subtle and wondrous" passage.

"Not full" is the true fullness. After seeing the Dao, to be full and possess it is to depart from the Dao. The Dao has no form and cannot be contained by vessels. When used, it is inexhaustible; when sought, it cannot be obtained. Thus, those who attain the Dao are never full, yet their use is endless. Those who attain the Dao are never new, for the Dao’s function pervades the myriad things without weariness—without weariness, without newness, without completion, without failure. Weariness arises from newness, failure from completion. Though the scholar completes the Dao, they are always like one worn and failed. If, upon attaining the Dao, they pride themselves on newness and completion, they differ from the Dao—this is not great completion.

The *Classic* says: "Great completion seems deficient; its use is unwearying." This passage proceeds step by step to completion—completing yet seeming worn is its culmination.

】 Attain utmost emptiness and firmly preserve profound stillness—then the myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. Now, things flourish in abundance, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life-destiny. Returning to life-destiny is called constancy. Knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune. Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing; being all-embracing, one is impartial; being impartial, one is kingly; being kingly, one accords with Heaven; according with Heaven, one accords with the Dao; according with the Dao, one endures long—even to the end of life, one does not perish.

[Kaiyuan Commentary: *Zhi* means to cause something to come of itself, as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* where *zhi shi* means "to engage in battle." *Zuo* means "to act," as in "the sun rises and one acts." *Yun yun* describes the state of their arising. *Chang* is the constancy of the constant Dao. Because it is the master of the ten thousand images, it is called "kingly"; because it is the father of all, it is called "Heaven."]

Su Che’s Annotation:
If one does not attain utmost emptiness, something remains unvanished. If one does not firmly preserve stillness, movement remains unvanished. Though mountains and hills may be removed, the slightest speck of dust remains—this is not yet "utmost" or "firm." Now, to attain emptiness is still to retain emptiness, which has not yet departed from being; to preserve stillness is still to guard against movement—how much more so with other things? Without attaining utmost emptiness or firmly preserving stillness, to demand the function of emptiness and stillness is difficult indeed. Only by attaining utmost emptiness and firmly preserving stillness can one observe the transformations of the myriad things and not be confused by their changes, knowing that all arising must return. If I, too, am caught up in the arising of the myriad things, I cannot know this.

All things arise from their nature and return to their nature—like blossoms and leaves that grow from the root and return to the root, or waves that rise from water and return to water. If one has not yet returned to one’s nature, merely ceasing movement and stilling thoughts to seek stillness is not true stillness. Only by returning to the root is there stillness. *Ming* (life-destiny) is the wonder of nature; nature can be spoken of, but when it comes to *ming*, it cannot be spoken of. The *Book of Changes* says: "Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach *ming*." The sage’s study of the Dao must begin with exhausting principle, proceed through fulfilling nature, and culminate in returning to *ming*.

Humaneness, rightness, ritual, and music are how the sage engages with things, yet the function of humaneness, rightness, ritual, and music must have a source. Those who act without knowing their source are vulgar scholars; those who know their source and then act are noble persons. This is called "exhausting principle." Yet even after exhausting the mind to exhaust principle, one must seek to obtain it—without seeking, one does not obtain. When affairs and things daily confront one, only by seeking can one respond; thus, the effort is laborious, and the achievement is slight.

The sage, apart from being obscured by things, maintains a nature that is profoundly clear, effortlessly centered, unthinking yet attaining, responding to things as they arrive—this is called "fulfilling nature." Yet even so, this is still my nature, and there remains a distinction between self and things, which guards against delusion. The ruler’s *ming* is called *ming*; Heaven’s *ming* is called *ming*. Engaging with things through nature yet not knowing it as oneself is why it is entrusted to *ming*—this is called "returning to *ming*."

When things arise, even the vastness of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, have nothing that does not change and decay, nothing that is not impermanent. Only by returning to nature does one abide in profound constancy. If one does not regard returning to nature as clarity, it is merely worldly wisdom—though one may call it clarity, it is not true clarity. Not knowing to return to nature, one moves with things, and there is no action that is not misfortune. Though one may gain for a time, one loses in the long run.

When deluded by delusion, one is self-righteous and denies others; all things become one’s enemies—how can one be a guest? If one knows that all is delusion, then even enemies will be pitied and cherished—what cannot be embraced? With nothing not embraced, the feelings of self and other are exhausted—whom would one favor? With nothing not impartial, the world will come and submit. With nothing not cherished, even Heaven cannot add to it. Heaven still has form; as for the Dao, it is the ultimate. Yet even the Dao cannot advance beyond this.

Lü’s Commentary:
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness; they attain emptiness without extremity, maintain stillness without rigidity—this is not the ultimate of non-fullness. As for the multitude and the myriad things, only when they rest do they reveal their return; only when they decline do they reveal their return to the root. Yet I, through the ultimate of emptiness and stillness, perceive the arising of the myriad things and their flourishing—this lies within me, not in them. What causes their arising is precisely what causes their return. When they flourish, this is precisely what causes their return to the root. Thus, observing their arising together is to observe their return: as they flourish, each returns to its root. Therefore, the so-called emptiness is not emptiness made by emptying, but simply non-fullness that results in emptiness. The so-called stillness is not stillness made by stilling, for as the myriad things flourish and each returns to its root, none can disturb the heart—thus it is still. Hence, returning to the root is called stillness. The Mandate is what we receive to live. Only through stillness can one return to that which gives life and thereby command things. Thus, stillness is called returning to the Mandate. When the Dao reaches the point of commanding things, it abides constantly without departing. Hence, returning to the Mandate is called constancy. Viewed from constancy, fortune and misfortune, regret and shame are ever apparent in the subtlest movements—what clarity could surpass this? Thus, knowing constancy is called clarity. Those who do not know constancy act in opposition to it, and all their actions are but delusion. Those who know constancy and embody it find the myriad things and the self as one. Thus, knowing constancy allows all things to be embraced, and the self and the myriad things become one—no longer cherishing the self in private. Embracing is thus impartial; the myriad things and the self as one, without partiality, are vast. Vastness is sageliness. Inner sageliness and outer kingship—thus impartiality is kingship. Sageliness then reaches the divine; thus kingship is Heaven. Heaven is then the divine. The Dao is what completes sageliness and exhausts the divine. Thus, Heaven is the Dao. Practicing the Dao to attain constancy is to exhaust it. Thus, the Dao endures, and the body does not perish. Enduring to the point where the body does not perish—this is what constancy means.

*Brush Records*:
Attaining emptiness without knowing that reality is itself emptiness—emptiness is not yet ultimate. Maintaining stillness without knowing that movement is itself stillness—stillness is not yet profound. Those who observe nothingness in nothingness have never observed it in being. Thus, observe the myriad things as they arise together: though they seem to move and be real, in truth, not even the slightest movement or reality exists. To observe thus is to observe return. Return is returning to the beginning. Those who cannot observe return yet halt movement to seek stillness—desiring stillness, they only stir further. When things flourish and return to their root, all thoughts naturally cease in their place. Not seeking stillness, they attain true stillness. Stillness is returning to the Mandate. It is called Mandate, not nature, because nature can be spoken of, but the Mandate cannot. The *Book of Changes* says: "Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach the Mandate." Principle and nature are not without subtlety, yet there is still subtlety beyond them. To exhaust and fulfill them is to find them inexhaustible—this is the ultimate Mandate. Thus, the Mandate transcends nature. Where there is action, there is change; returning to the Mandate is action without action—this is true constancy, which only the enlightened can know. Knowing constancy brings stillness and fortune; not knowing constancy brings delusion and misfortune. When deluded by delusion, one is self-righteous and denies others—incapable of embracing. Knowing constancy, one forgets both good and evil, leaving no trace of right or wrong—what cannot be embraced? Embracing is impartiality; impartiality is kingship; kingship is Heaven; Heaven is the Mandate. At this point, the Dao is complete, and one may endure without peril—this is but a secondary matter.

The Highest does not let them know of his existence; the next is loved and praised; the next is feared; the next is scorned. Where trust is insufficient, there is distrust. How cautious he is in his words! When his work is accomplished and his affairs completed, the hundred clans all say, "We are naturally so."

Lu Xiusheng’s Commentary:
The rulers of highest antiquity, possessing virtue, acted without trace, so the people only knew of their existence above—saying, "What has the emperor’s power to do with me?" As virtue declined, benevolence and righteousness governed the world. The people, embraced by benevolence, loved them; cherished by righteousness, praised them. When benevolence and righteousness were insufficient to govern the heart, punishments and laws were used—thus the people feared them. When punishments and laws were insufficient to control the will, cunning and deception were employed—thus the masses scorned them. Ah! That which is true in the heart is called sincerity; words that can be fulfilled are called trust. When sincerity is not true, words cannot be fulfilled—yet one still values and esteems them. Can this be called sincerity and trust? When the Dao is hidden, benevolence and righteousness become manifest; when benevolence and righteousness fail, punishments arise—yet one still exalts these later arts. Can this be called the Dao? The sage does otherwise: holding to antiquity, guiding the present, carving simplicity from the uncarved—accomplishing work without attachment, completing affairs without action. Following the times, he establishes his work, allowing the hundred clans to fulfill their natures, all saying, "We are naturally so." Thus, the hearts of love, praise, fear, and scorn do not arise in the world.

Su’s Commentary:
The Highest rules the world through the Dao’s all-pervading influence without governing, so the people do not know why things are so—they only know of his existence. The next rules through benevolence and righteousness; his virtue can be embraced, his achievements seen—thus the people love and praise him. Though his name is fair, the distinction between favor and disfavor begins here. The next governs through policies to order the people; though the people do not lack fear, where power does not reach, they scorn him. If one truly trusts oneself, ruling through the Dao is sufficient. Only when one lacks self-trust, adding benevolence and righteousness, then punishments and policies, do the people begin to distrust. The sage trusts himself abundantly; in his words, he values them carefully, not lightly uttering them—thus the people trust him. When his work is accomplished and his affairs completed, the people daily move toward goodness and away from wrongdoing without realizing it.

Lü’s Commentary:
Holding to the great image, the world comes. As the world is about to release me, it forgets me—whose trace can be seen? Thus, the people only know of his existence—nothing surpasses this, so it is called the Highest. The next is loved and praised; the next is feared and scorned—this can be known. How to discuss it? Consider the love and reverence between father and son—it is self-evident without words. As for the relationship between host and guest, or friends, to convey reverence, one must adorn it with words to be understood. Why? It is merely a matter of trust being sufficient or not. Thus, love and praise already arise from insufficient trust and distrust—how much more so fear and scorn?

Yet if one wishes to make trust fully sufficient and eliminate distrust, what should be done? Should one not value speech to return to the Dao? Valuing speech means practicing the teaching without words. Practicing the teaching without words, one engages in affairs of non-action—this can be known. When merits are accomplished and affairs completed, the hundred clans say, “We are thus of ourselves,” unaware of who brought it about—then who could love and praise them?

Wu’s Commentary:
*Tai shang* means “the highest,” referring to the age of the Great Dao, where all forget non-action and the people do not know their superiors exist. The next refers to rulers of benevolence and righteousness, whom the people love as parents; when benevolence and righteousness become more manifest, the people not only love them but also praise them. The next refers to rulers of wisdom, whom the people fear as divine; when wisdom is exhausted, the people not only fear them but also scorn them. Trust is the substance of the Great Dao. When the substance of the Great Dao is insufficient and cannot match the age of antiquity, rulers no longer treat the people with its substance, and daily incline toward ornamentation. Thus, with one descent, they employ benevolence and righteousness; with a second descent, they employ wisdom. The preceding speaks of the *tai shang* not being known—this is like the earlier chapter’s “valuing treasures.” Yet even so, treasures are held in their words, not lightly uttered, like a dog hesitating and retreating. The sage does not speak, acting without action, so the people subtly receive his gifts and each lives in peace. When his merits are complete and affairs accomplished, the hundred clans all say, “We are thus of ourselves,” unaware of the ruler’s gift.

When the Great Dao is abandoned, benevolence, righteousness, and wisdom emerge; when great falsity arises, the six relations are not harmonious, and filial piety appears; when the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.

Wang Fuzhi’s Commentary: The six relations are father, son, elder brother, younger brother, husband, and wife. Filial piety and compassion refer to filial sons and compassionate grandsons.

Su’s Commentary:
When the Great Dao flourishes, benevolence and righteousness operate within it, yet the people do not notice. Only when the Great Dao is abandoned do benevolence and righteousness appear. The world does not know that the Dao suffices to satisfy all things, so it imposes wisdom upon them, and thus the people begin to repay with falsity. When the six relations are harmonious, who is not filial or compassionate? When the state is well-governed, who is not loyal? Yao was not unfilial, yet only Shun is praised—because he had no blind father. Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou were not disloyal, yet only Longfeng and Bigan are praised—because they had no Jie or Zhou. Fish in a drying marsh blow foam at one another, moisten one another with wetness—how much better to forget one another in rivers and lakes!

Wang Jiefu’s Commentary:
The Dao flows in formlessness; names arise from insufficiency. When the Dao flows in formlessness, there is no distinction between great and small. When names arise from insufficiency, there are gradations of benevolence, righteousness, and wisdom. Benevolence involves partiality; righteousness involves distinction. Because of this partiality and distinction, the Great Dao is abandoned.

The wise possess knowledge; the perceptive possess discernment. Because they have knowledge and discernment, this is how great falsity arises. The filial each cherish their own parents; the compassionate each dote on their own children—this is why the six relations are not harmonious. The loyal are loyal to their own lord and call it loyalty; loyal to another’s lord, they call it treason.

Lü’s Commentary:
The Dao cannot be named; to name it as Dao is already not the Dao. Then to further divide it into benevolence and righteousness—how can this be the whole of the Dao? Thus, those who possess benevolence and righteousness are surely those who have abandoned the Great Dao. No harm is greater than virtue with intent, intent with eyes, and eyes that turn inward. Inward gaze leads to ruin. Thus, the emergence of wisdom and discernment is precisely what gives rise to great falsity. Falsity is the opposite of virtue. Without benevolence and righteousness, their absence extends to the six relations becoming disharmonious, and so filial piety and compassion arise. With great falsity, its effects extend to the state falling into chaos, and so loyal ministers arise. Therefore, only with the obstinacy of Gusou and the arrogance of Xiang did Shun emerge; only with the tyranny of Jie and Zhou did Longfeng and Bigan arise. There is no other reason—it is simply that they have drifted ever farther from the root.

Xizhai’s Commentary:
When the Dao scatters, it descends and gives birth to wrongdoing; when falsity prevails, it reverses and reveres the Dao. Descending is the Dao’s decline; reversing is the extremity of lament. When the Dao has not yet scattered, benevolence and righteousness lie hidden within it, undivided and unenumerated. But when one acts with tender affection as benevolence, people respond with tender affection, cherishing that benevolence; when one acts with rigid integrity as righteousness, people respond with rigid integrity, cherishing that righteousness. If the Great Dao were practiced and the world held in common, how could benevolence and righteousness ever stand before it? Unfortunately, there are those with petty wisdom and cunning who usurp benevolence and righteousness to put them into practice—thus, falsity begins to flourish, and disorder begins here. This is what is meant by descending and giving birth to wrongdoing. As it flows to its end, human falsity multiplies, and nothing is not false. Amidst the clamor of falsity, those who slightly distinguish themselves are then revered—thus, only when the six relations are disharmonious does one know of filial piety and compassion; only when the state is in chaos does one know of loyal ministers. This is what is meant by reversing and revering the Dao. When the Dao scatters, one sees its semblance and forgets its wholeness; when it declines, it is utterly exhausted, yet what is revered is only its semblance. This is why it descends ever lower.

Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion. Abandon skill, discard profit, and thieves and bandits will cease to exist. These three are insufficient as cultural refinements, so let them be directed toward something: manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires.

Su’s Commentary:
Without sagacity and wisdom, one cannot know the Dao. If sagacity and wisdom were employed to govern the world, could there be any who would not use the Dao to guide things? Yet the people of the world are insufficient to grasp the root of sagacity and wisdom, seeing only their branches and mistaking them for cunning that overcomes things. Thus, they gallop along the branches’ currents, and the people begin to suffer their harm. Therefore, abandon sagacity and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. There has never been benevolence that neglects one’s kin, nor righteousness that betrays one’s lord. Benevolence and righteousness are what give rise to filial piety and compassion. Yet when they decline, people usurp the names of benevolence and righteousness to seek profit in the world—thus, children defy fathers, and fathers abuse children. This is the doing of the traces of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion. Skill is for facilitating tasks; profit is for aiding others. Neither is intended to foster theft, yet without them, thieves and bandits cannot act. Therefore, abandon skill and discard profit, and thieves and bandits will cease to exist. The world reveres these three as the cause of its disorder, for cultural refinements are insufficient. Thus, some direct them toward sagacity and wisdom, some toward benevolence and righteousness, and some toward skill and profit—all to refine governance. Yet the world grows ever more disordered. Why not return to the root? Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires, and the world will each return to its nature. Even with these three, there will be no use for them. Thus it is said: “I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.” This is the ultimate of sagacity and wisdom, the perfection of benevolence and righteousness, the extremity of skill and profit. Yet Confucius governed the world with benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, while Laozi abandoned and discarded them. Some may think them different. The *Yi* says: “That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is within form is called the vessel.” Confucius, deeply concerned for later generations, showed people the vessel while obscuring the Dao, so that those below the middle level would hold to the vessel and not be misled by the Dao, thus not failing to be gentlemen. Those above the middle level would naturally progress upward from there. Laozi, however, was not like this. His aim was to illuminate the Dao and urgently open people’s minds, so he showed them the Dao while slighting the vessel. If scholars only know the vessel, the Dao is lost. Thus, he abandoned benevolence and righteousness, discarded ritual and music, to clarify the Dao. The Dao cannot be spoken; whatever can be spoken is only its semblance. The enlightened recognize the real through semblance, while the benighted cling to semblance and fall into falsity. Thus, later generations have used Laozi’s words to disrupt the world, while those who study Confucius commit no great errors. Many have used Laozi’s words to grasp the Dao, yet those who seek it in Confucius often find no entry point. These two sages both acted out of necessity. To perfect one is to neglect the other.

Lü’s commentary: The sage knew that the world’s chaos begins with losing one’s original nature through delusion of the root. Only the uncarved simplicity of the nameless can settle it. Thus, "cut off sageliness and abandon wisdom, sever benevolence and discard righteousness, break craft and reject profit"—these are the means to restore our nameless simplicity and settle it.

To cut off sageliness and abandon wisdom, to sever benevolence and discard righteousness, is to prevent beauty and goodness from burdening the heart. To break craft and reject profit is to prevent evil and ungoodness from burdening the heart. When nothing burdens the heart within and no traces are left without, the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold, they return to filial piety and kindness, and thieves and bandits vanish—this is the inherent principle.

Now, "cutting off sageliness and abandoning wisdom, severing benevolence and discarding righteousness" is the fullest expression of "not exalting the worthy." To cut off and discard them is not merely to refrain from exalting them but to eliminate them entirely. "Breaking craft and rejecting profit" is the fullest expression of "not prizing rare goods." To break and discard them is not merely to refrain from prizing them but to abolish them entirely.

Human life is such that all things are complete within me—possessing the utmost abundance of wealth. If one can cut off sageliness and abandon wisdom to return to the beginning, their benefit increases a hundredfold. When the people return to filial piety and kindness, the six relations all harmonize without awareness of filial piety and kindness. When thieves and bandits vanish, the state is well-governed without awareness of benevolent ministers.

"Not exalting the worthy" causes the people not to contend, and their benefit increases a hundredfold; when they return to filial piety and kindness, it is not merely that they do not contend but that contention ceases entirely. "Not prizing rare goods" causes the people not to steal; when thieves and bandits vanish, it is not merely that they do not steal but that theft ceases entirely. Sageliness and wisdom, benevolence and righteousness, craft and profit—these are the very things to be cut off and discarded.

These three—when taken as embellishments rather than substance, as insufficiency rather than wholeness—must be cut off and discarded, directing one instead to what truly belongs: to perceive the plain and embrace the unhewn, to diminish self-interest and reduce desires—this is what truly belongs.

To perceive the plain is to know it is free from admixture and not mere embellishment; to embrace the unhewn is to know it is undivided and not mere insufficiency. Plain and unadulterated, unhewn and undivided—this is to return to one’s nature, so that external things cannot delude, and self-interest and desires diminish. Only then can one speak of the ultimate Dao of cutting off learning.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
The sage does not regard himself as sagely; the wise do not regard themselves as wise. If sageliness and wisdom could be cut off, they would not be true sageliness and wisdom. The benevolent do not regard themselves as benevolent; the righteous do not regard themselves as righteous. If benevolence and righteousness could be cut off, they would not be true benevolence and righteousness. Great skill does not display its skill; great profit does not display its profit. If skill and profit could be cut off, they would not be true skill and profit.

The sage employs substance, not embellishment, so what appears externally has no fixed form. The multitude, stealing semblances, confuse the real, so what appears externally has an attachment—yet without fixed form, it benefits things without their awareness. Having an attachment is merely enough to disorder the world. The sage detests falsehood for its power to confuse the real, so he seeks to sever its root to remedy the ills of its branches, ensuring the world’s people no longer harbor profit-seeking minds, nor feign sagely wisdom in conduct, nor borrow benevolence and righteousness while abandoning the reality of filial piety and kindness, nor employ thieves and bandits while discarding the convenience of skill and profit. Only by placing plainness and unhewn simplicity before the people—so that seeing his plainness and unhewn simplicity, they dare not deceive with embellishment, nor display private desires—do they, seeing his diminished self-interest and reduced desires, dare not deceive themselves with embellishment.

**Bisheng’s Notes:**
*Shu* (属) is like Zhuangzi’s “attaching to one’s nature.” Benevolence and righteousness are *shu*—mere attachments. Sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit—these three arise as the world’s Dao daily trends toward embellishment, hence their names. From the perspective of one who knows the Dao, these are embellishments. Embellishment is insufficient to govern the world; better to direct one’s intent to *shu*.

Perceive the plain and embrace the unhewn—then self-interest and desires diminish, and the world is at peace. Plainness is unpainted; unhewn is uncarved—this is the beginning of nature, the real. Roaming in the beginning of nature, though one has a body, it is as if one has no body, so self-interest is minimal. Though one has a mind, it is as if one has no mind, so desires are few. Thus, perceiving the plain and embracing the unhewn is the essence of sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness—why employ embellishment?

Laozi cuts these off there precisely to attach them here. Scholars who fail to grasp his intent, seeing only that he cuts and discards, rashly claim Laozi’s teachings are reckless and lawless—this is what is meant by “not attaining the words.”

**Cutting off learning brings no care.**
How far apart are *wei* and *a*?
How far apart are good and evil?
What others fear, one must also fear—
vast and boundless, it has no end!

The multitude bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on the grand sacrifice,
as if ascending the terrace in spring.
I alone remain still, without sign,
like an infant who has not yet smiled,
adrift, as if with no place to return.
The multitude all have more than enough;
I alone seem lacking.
My mind is that of a fool—how dull!
The common folk are bright;
I alone am dim.
The common folk are sharp;
I alone am muddled.
Vast, like the boundless sea,
ceaseless, as if without rest.
The multitude all have purpose;
I alone am stubborn, like a rustic.
I alone differ from others,
yet I value feeding from the Mother.

The signs are like the cracks in a tortoise shell—subtle movements indeed. *Hai* means an infant’s smile; once it smiles, emotions stir and consciousness arises. To have a destination is to halt one’s carriage and not ride on—"adrift, as if with no place to return" means having no fixed abode.

Ma Jiuji said: "Nature admits no excess or lack; all surplus is beyond one’s portion." Feasting on the grand sacrifice or ascending the spring terrace—all such gains are beyond one’s portion, hence "the multitude all have more than enough." *Yi* means loss.

*Dun* is like the primordial chaos—unaware. Some texts write it as *chun*. "Small brightness" refers to *zhao* and *cha*, petty and meticulous. *Men* (pronounced *moben*) means dull, numb to pain. In ancient times, the capital was called *beautiful*, and the countryside *rustic*. *Shi* (pronounced *si*) means to feed; *Mother* refers to the nursing mother, as seen in the *Liji*’s "Nei Ze" chapter.

Su’s commentary: Cultivation through learning daily increases; cultivation of the Dao daily diminishes. Not knowing the proper course of nature and destiny, one seeks to augment through learning, piling up what one has not heard until it cannot be unified—thus the square harms the circle, the straight harms the crooked, and the mind becomes entangled, overwhelmed with cares. This is the calamity of scholars, hence "cutting off learning brings no care." As for the sage, though he has never ceased learning, he takes the Dao as his master—learning without deficiency, learning without disorder, vast and carefree. Why then cut off learning?

Scholars drown in what they have heard, unable to unify it, so their *wei* becomes arrogance and their *a* becomes sloth—these cannot be spoken of in the same breath. How much less can the opposition of good and evil be compared? Only the sage knows that the myriad things all emerge from nature yet are completed in delusion—like painting horses and oxen, like carving tigers and swine, none of which are real. Pitying this, he makes no distinctions of right and wrong, same and different. Who then knows how far apart they are?

If one knows this, then the myriad things grow together without harming one another, and the Dao flows in parallel without conflict—nothing is strange. The sage equalizes self and other, unifies same and different, leaving no residue in his mind. Yet how could he thereby neglect worldly laws, violate social roles, or disrupt order? What others fear, I too fear; what others do, I too do. Though I stand among rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, moving within the realms of ritual, music, punishment, and governance, the world does not perceive my difference. What keeps me untouched by things is only the mind.

People all follow what they know, rigidly confined to their paths. The sage encompasses both being and non-being, entering all without obstruction—vast and boundless, it has no end. Each person drowns in their preferences, their beauty like feasting on the grand sacrifice, their joy like ascending the spring terrace, clamoring to follow without knowing its falsity. Only the sage deeply investigates delusion, meeting it with stillness, unmoved like an infant who has not yet smiled. Riding the principle of the myriad things without selfishness, he seems as if with no place to return.

The multitude cling to what they know, each considering themselves abundant. The sage embraces the myriad things without favoring one, transcending as if lacking. *Dun dun*, like a fool yet not a fool. The world takes discrimination as knowledge; the sage knows the futility of distinguishing among delusions. Thus outwardly he seems dim, inwardly muddled, vast like the boundless sea, drifting without rest. People each have their abilities, so the world can employ them all. The sage’s talent is complete and virtue perfect, yet he seems to have nothing to offer—hence he is suspected of being stubborn and rustic.

The Dao is the Mother of the myriad things. The multitude pursue things and forget the Dao, but the sage sheds all things and takes the Dao as his foundation. Like an infant with no mixed diet, he feeds only from the Mother.

Lü’s commentary: Above, he cuts off the goodness of sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness; below, he cuts off the evil of cunning and profit. Not burdening the mind with these is to cut off learning. Cutting off learning is non-action; non-action is spirit. The spirit is the drum of the myriad things, not sharing the sage’s cares, hence "cutting off learning brings no care."

*Wei* and *a* arise from the same sound—how far apart are they? Good and evil diverge from the one Dao—how far apart are they? This is why even sagely wisdom is cut off and discarded, not burdening the mind. Regret and remorse lie in petty distinctions; freedom from blame lies in vastness. Regret is what people fear, and one must fear it. Vast and boundless, it has no end—this is not only fearing what others fear.

Why? What others fear must be feared to be in accord with people. Vast and boundless, it has no end—to be in accord with Heaven.

The multitude, bustling and joyous, do not know to block their openings and shut their gates. Like feasting on grand sacrifices, they do not know the blandness of flavorlessness; like ascending a terrace in spring, they do not know the insufficiency of what meets the eye. I alone am cautious, as yet without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile—blocking my openings, shutting my gates, finding no flavor to crave, no sight to delight in.

Adrift, adrift, as if with no place to return—this speaks to how the myriad things drift, yet in myself, I have no fixed abode. The multitude, like feasting on grand sacrifices or ascending a terrace in spring, thus all have surplus. I alone am cautious, as yet without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile, thus alone seem lacking. All this speaks to relinquishing things and departing from form.

My heart is that of a fool—this speaks to its lack of knowledge. Pure, pure—this speaks to its lack of admixture. The vulgar are bright and clear; I alone seem dim. The vulgar are sharp and discerning; I alone seem dull. Vast and indistinct, like darkness—utterly without sight. Not merely dim and dull, but in motion, adrift, adrift, as if with no place to return; in stillness, silent, as if with no place to rest. The vulgar are bright and clear, the vulgar are sharp and discerning, thus all have means. I alone seem dim, I alone seem dull, thus seem crude and rustic. All this speaks to casting off knowledge and forgetting the heart.

For sight, hearing, thought, and reflection arise from the Dao. Thus, in relation to the Dao, they are children, while the Dao is their mother. The multitude pursue things, enslave their knowledge, and employ sight, hearing, thought, and reflection—nourishing only their children. But I relinquish and abandon these, for I value nourishing the mother. Thus it is said: "I alone differ from others and value feeding on the mother."

How spirit-like is Laozi! What need has he for nourishment, yet he differs from the multitude and the vulgar? He desires those who practice the Dao to know this, that they may thereby attain the Dao. Thus, the great purport of "cutting off learning" may be known. Yet earlier scholars, believing that one who does not learn is no better than a beast, have utterly failed to grasp the meaning of "cutting off learning brings no care."

**Xizhai’s Commentary:**
Learning that does not reach the point of "nothing to learn" is not "cutting off learning." The Dao takes "no attainment" as attainment; learning takes "no learning" as true learning. If the Dao could be attained, it would all be benevolence and righteousness; if learning could be learned, it would all be names and numbers. Thus, the sage takes "no attainment" as attainment of the Dao and "no learning" as true learning. Hence, "cutting off learning brings no care." If one has not yet reached "no learning," then the learning of the world is endless—grasping one and losing two, gaining here and failing there—necessarily taking gain as joy and loss as sorrow, without respite.

The root of the Dao is originally not different. If one does not grasp the root but seeks to equalize the branches, the branches will inevitably diverge greatly. Moreover, "reverence" and "flattery" arise from the same sound—how far apart are they? Facing principle is good; turning from it is evil—how far apart are they? The sage has observed their beginnings and knows their root is the same, thus turning flattery into reverence and evil into good in an instant. If one knows that reverence and flattery, good and evil, share the same root, then attaining "cutting off learning" is not difficult.

Yet when the sage emerges to respond to the world, how can he easily change what the world desires to follow his own desires, or align the world’s views with his own? What others delight in, he also delights in; what others fear, he also fears. But what differs from the multitude is this: the multitude’s joy is boundless, bustling and joyous, their delight like ascending a terrace in spring, their beauty like feasting on grand sacrifices. Bright and clear, they deem themselves wise; sharp and discerning, they deem none their equal. Their hearts truly believe in joy, in beauty, in brightness, in wisdom—blind to their own nature, knowing only what is tangible. Thus, their hearts see nothing beyond.

The sage’s heart roams in the Dao; his responses to things are not real. Thus, cautious, as yet without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile; adrift, adrift, as if with no place to return; swift as the sea, drifting, as if with no place to rest. The multitude all have surplus; I alone seem lacking. The multitude all have means; I alone seem crude and rustic. Is this truly the heart of a fool? It is that I differ from the multitude—knowing the root, reaching the origin, not flowing into the branches. This is called "valuing feeding on the mother."

**Bisheng’s Notes:**
People’s learning is troubled by not attaining goodness. If I can cut off learning, what sorrow is there? Yet this is not forced cessation. It is knowing that human nature is originally without goodness. Those who practice goodness, though different from evil, are equally distant from nature—their slight difference is like that between reverence and flattery.

Though good and evil share the same root, the sage does not abandon goodness, for what people fear cannot but be feared—this is what is meant by "fortune and misfortune shared with the people." As for the heart’s return to the original nature, it is vast and boundless, without limit—how could it be like goodness, which has shores and bounds? Thus, people delight in goodness like feasting on grand sacrifices or ascending a terrace in spring, while I alone am tranquil, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile, without sign. Adrift, adrift, with no place to return, no anchorage.

People’s attainment of goodness all has surplus, while I alone seem lacking, like a fool, dull and without knowledge. People are bright and clear, all as if having means, while I alone seem dim and dull, vast and indistinct, like the sea, drifting without rest. Is this truly the sage’s crudeness and rusticity? It is that the multitude all pursue their children, while I alone value the mother—thus I cannot but differ from the multitude.

For nature is neither good nor evil, yet the myriad phenomena of good and evil all arise from it—thus it is called "feeding on the mother." Dong Sijing [remarks]: "Some say that *wei* and *a* both emerge from sound, good and evil both arise from action. The great observer sees their root as fundamentally not different—just like the lost sheep in the tale of Zang and Gu." This is indeed what the Most High means by "forgetting emotions," where right and wrong are both dissolved—only thus can one act. The learner must fix their gaze precisely where good and evil cannot be named; to simply equate good and evil would be to abandon the world to evil without regard—how could this be reasonable?

Chunfu’s annotation: The heavens, without the sun, cannot illuminate things; people, without learning, cannot attain the Dao. Thus it is said: "Learning is the white sun of the mind." Yet the sage declares, "Abandon learning, and there will be no worries"—how could this truly mean reckless neglect of the mind? What must be abandoned is worldly learning, while what must be valued is the learning of "feeding on the mother." What is the mother? Virtue is the mother of the myriad things, and the Dao is in turn the mother of virtue—thus what the sage calls "mother" encompasses both Dao and virtue. To "feed" is to savor for one’s own nourishment. Savoring Dao and virtue to nourish oneself is to act without acting yet accomplish all, and its joy is measureless. Why then trouble oneself with vulgar learning, only to invite worry? This is how the sage differs from others.

"The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.
As for the Dao—it is a thing elusive and evanescent.
Evanescent, elusive, yet within it are images;
Elusive, evanescent, yet within it are things.
Abstruse, obscure, yet within it is essence;
Its essence is most true, and within it is trustworthiness.
From ancient times to now, its name has never departed,
By which we witness the origins of the multitude.
How do I know the nature of the multitude’s origins?
By this."

When Dao circulates and becomes virtue, it takes on form. Thus, virtue is the manifestation of Dao. Extending this principle, the forms of all things are Dao’s manifestation in the phenomenal world. Dao transcends being and non-being, hence it is described as "elusive and evanescent." Yet when it moves to form images and coalesces into things, nothing fails to emerge from this elusiveness. At the undetermined stage between being and non-being, it remains evanescent and invisible; but at the intersection of being and non-being, its profound obscurity becomes apparent. Though wood takes shape, its essence abides within.

Once things assume form, truth and falsehood intermingle. While essence remains, falsehood cannot intrude. But when truth and falsehood mingle, one becomes two, two becomes three, and a tangled profusion arises—no longer to be trusted. Yet while essence endures, it does not deceive us.

Though ages differ, Dao never departs; thus it is named "the Unchanging." Precisely because it never departs, it can witness the transformations of all beings. All things, however beautiful, are subject to change. The sage’s knowledge of why things are as they are comes from embodying Dao without departure.

---

Virtue’s vast bearing is the fullest expression of Dao. When one abandons things, detaches from form, relinquishes knowledge, and forgets the mind—approaching the state of a rustic—what then remains to follow? Only Dao.

Dao as a thing is both elusive and evanescent. In its elusiveness and evanescence, it is neither obscure nor distinct—neither obscure nor distinct, and thus luminous. This luminosity gives the impression of something substantial. Yet within it lies image—an impression of substance that is not substance. Hence it is called "the image of no-thing" and "the great image without form."

In its evanescence and elusiveness, it is neither bright nor dim—neither bright nor dim, and thus obscure. This obscurity gives the impression of nothingness. Yet within it lies thing—an impression of nothingness that is indeed something. Hence it is called "the form of no-form" and "a thing uncarved, complete."

Elusive and evanescent, it is unfathomable—unfathomable, and thus numinous. Profoundly obscure, it is numinous beyond measure. Numinous beyond measure, it attains essence. Thus it is said: "Abstruse, obscure, yet within it is essence." Essence is the undiluted attainment of Dao.

Among all things under heaven, nothing is truer, more trustworthy, more constant, or more unchanging. The origin of all things lies herein, and thus we witness their beginnings. Therefore it is said: "Its essence is most true, and within it is trustworthiness. From ancient times to now, its name has never departed, by which we witness the origins of the multitude."

Dao is neither bright nor obscure; it preserves its elusiveness. Without seeing, without hearing, it enters profound obscurity. There is image—there is thing; there is thing—there is essence; there is essence—there is trustworthiness. When Dao attains trustworthiness, it aligns with the heart, and all things are attained.

To know how heaven and earth and the myriad things become what they are, one must begin here. Thus it is said: "How do I know the nature of the multitude’s origins? By this."

---

"Hole" signifies vastness. The vastness of virtue is commensurate with its bearing, yet it ultimately depends on Dao. Thus the text begins with Dao. I do not know its arising—Dao gives rise to it. I do not know its cessation—Dao brings it to rest.

Dao as a thing is elusive, evanescent, profoundly obscure, and not constant. Yet within its elusiveness lies image; within its evanescence lies thing; within its obscurity lies essence. Thus, within nothingness, nothing is not present.

What appears to be something within being is not true being, for being’s root is not substantial. What appears to be nothing within being is actually something. Conversely, what appears to be something within nothingness is not true nothingness, for nothingness’s root is not empty. What appears to be nothing within nothingness is actually something. Being’s something is but the coarse aspect of existence.

Only the something within nothingness is the true aspect of being. Precisely because it is true and not artificial, it neither persists through being nor perishes through non-being. This is called "trustworthiness." From ancient times to the present, it does not change or alter; its essence does not depart. The sage’s ability to observe the beginnings of all things and know their causes stems from embodying this ultimate nothingness, thereby witnessing the multitude of beings.

---

The bearing of vast virtue corresponds to the preceding chapter’s "still and formless" passage.

Only the Dao is to be followed—this means that the bearing of vast virtue and all appearances arise from the Dao. This is why the sage values "feeding from the mother."

Below, the text repeatedly depicts the marvel of the Dao’s essence: "elusive and evanescent," "dim and obscure," all conveying the meaning of profundity, subtlety, and formlessness. "Things" refer to forms, "true" to essence, and "trustworthy" to what is real. The variations in phrasing harmonize with poetic rhythm; to parse each line rigidly would be forced. "Experience" means traversing. "The multitude of beginnings" refers to all things under heaven and earth that issue from the Dao. Though the multitude of beginnings transform and flow, the Dao remains eternally unchanged—hence, "from ancient times to the present, its name does not depart." The phrase "experiencing the multitude of beginnings" refers to traversing, while the earlier "elusive and evanescent, dim and obscure" describes the Dao’s nature. How do we know that the multitude of beginnings are traversed by the Dao? Precisely because the Dao’s essence—elusive, evanescent, dim, and obscure—cannot be altered or destroyed. Thus, while the multitude of beginnings pass away, the Dao abides, like an inn that hosts transient guests.

Su Zizhan said: "That which passes is like this stream, yet it never truly departs; that which waxes and wanes is like the moon, yet in the end it neither increases nor diminishes." This aligns with the present meaning. A Chan master put it even more plainly: "There is a thing prior to heaven and earth, formless and fundamentally quiescent; it can be the master of all images yet does not decay with the four seasons."

*Brush Jottings* states: The Dao is without form; whatever can be described by form belongs to virtue. Yet by knowing the bearing of virtue, one may also come to recognize the Dao—as in the so-called "elusive and evanescent, dim and obscure." Those who study the Dao prefer action, and when they encounter the elusive, evanescent, dim, and obscure, they find it difficult to approach or settle into. They do not realize that the elusive and evanescent, though formless, *are* form; though without thing, *are* thing; the dim and obscure, though without essence, *are* essence. As the Buddhist scriptures say: "If one sees all forms as non-form, one sees the Tathāgata." The provisional is called false, the constant true. The elusive, evanescent, dim, and obscure neither persist through being nor perish through non-being—what could be more real and trustworthy than this? Hence, "from ancient times to the present, its name does not depart."

Those who are benighted claim that within the elusive, evanescent, dim, and obscure, there truly exists some thing. But the elusive, evanescent, dim, and obscure transcend boundaries—what could such a thing adhere to? Moreover, if it had a presence, it would also have a departure—how then could it endure through all time? If so, what does it mean to "experience the multitude of beginnings"? "Beginnings" means origins. People cling to the multitude of beings as real yet cannot fathom the subtle and wondrous between presence and absence because they have never experienced their origin. To experience the origin of the multitude of beings is to know that there was never a true beginning. Knowing that there was never a true beginning, one sees that all beings are wondrous, and their elusive, evanescent, dim, and obscure nature is one. Thus, one knows that the multitude of beings are true emptiness precisely because one has experienced and known them.

Buddhist teachings often guide people to awakening through contemplative methods, yet Laozi’s words are no different. To experience the origin of beings is to see the emptiness of the past; to observe their subtleties is to see the emptiness of the future. When the myriad things arise, observe their return—then one sees the emptiness of the present. When a single thought returns to the root, the three temporal realms are forever severed. Yet all this depends on the ability to observe. For those who truly seek to "know the constant," they must begin here.

】"To bend is to be whole,
To twist is to be straight,
To hollow is to be filled,
To wear out is to be renewed,
To have little is to gain,
To have much is to be confused."

Thus the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven.
Not asserting oneself, one becomes illuminated;
Not self-righteous, one becomes distinguished;
Not boasting, one achieves merit;
Not self-aggrandizing, one endures.
It is precisely because one does not contend that no one under heaven can contend with them.

What the ancients called "to bend is to be whole"—how could this be empty words? Truly, wholeness is what they return to.

Su Zhe’s commentary:
When the sage acts, they necessarily follow the principle. Wherever the principle lies, whether straight or bent, the essential matter is to achieve harmony. Harmonious, they do not conflict with things; not conflicting, they remain whole.
If one is straight but not in accord with the principle, it is not true straightness. Following the principle, though bent, is the ultimate straightness under heaven.
What the multitude returns to is the lowly—though one may wish not to be filled, it cannot be avoided.
To be dazzlingly discerning is not the Dao;
To be dull and seemingly worn out is where daily renewal arises.
The Dao is simply the One. Attaining the One, there is nothing one does not attain. To learn much without unifying it with the One is to be confused.
To embrace the One is to return to one’s nature. For "to bend is to be whole, to twist is to be straight, to hollow is to be filled, to wear out is to be renewed, to have little is to gain"—all are the overflow of embracing the One.
Thus, it concludes with embracing the One.

The eye does not see itself, yet it can see things;
The mirror does not illuminate itself, yet it can illuminate things.
If one were to see or illuminate oneself, one would be too occupied with oneself to attend to other things.
"Not asserting oneself, not self-righteous, not boasting, not self-aggrandizing"—all are the overflow of not contending. Thus, it concludes with not contending.

The world takes the straight as right and the bent as wrong. If one were to follow the principle in the world, there would inevitably be times when one must bend. Therefore, at the end of the chapter, it reiterates: "How could this be empty words? Truly, wholeness is what they return to."

What is called "wholeness" is not merely preserving the self. Internally, it preserves the self; externally, it preserves things. Both self and things are preserved, and one returns to their nature—then their straightness is truly great.

Lü’s Commentary:
To know the origins of the myriad things is to be able to embrace the One and attain suppleness. Embracing the One and attaining suppleness, one can then bend, yield, hollow, and wear out.
Bending is the natural state of bending; yielding is bending made so by force. Among all things under heaven, only water aligns with the Dao. Flowing west or east, nothing can harm it—this is how bending preserves wholeness. Avoiding obstacles, it winds a thousand turns yet must flow east—this is how yielding becomes straight. Humbling itself, all valleys gather to it—this is how hollowing becomes fullness. Receiving the world’s filth, yet none can sully it—this is how wearing out becomes renewal. Only those who attain the One are sufficient for this. Thus, it is said: “Less is gained.” The reason the multitude cannot do this is their lack of oneness. Hence, it is said: “More is confusion.” In regulating finances, there must be a model; in transmitting earth and wood, there must be a model. What is held is simple, yet what is addressed is vast.
The sage embraces the One as the world’s model, and it is no different. Thus, one can bend, yield, hollow, and wear out—everywhere, nothing departs from the One. Therefore, by following what the world sees, one sees, yet does not see oneself. Thus, nothing seen is unexamined, and it is said: “Not seeing oneself, one is clear.” By following what the world deems right, one deems right, yet does not deem oneself right. Thus, nothing deemed right can be surpassed, and it is said: “Not deeming oneself right, one is distinguished.” By attributing achievement to the world, one does not claim it for oneself. Thus, merit belongs to the myriad things, and it is said: “Not boasting, one has merit.” By relying on the abilities of the myriad things, one does not pride oneself on superiority. Thus, one endures, and it is said: “Not self-aggrandizing, one endures.” In this way, there is nothing else—attaining the One, there is no self; without self, there is no contention. Only without contention can none under heaven contend with one.
The essence of the ancient saying “bending preserves wholeness” is this alone. Knowing how bending preserves wholeness, one knows how yielding becomes straight, hollowing becomes fullness, and wearing out becomes renewal. Not seeing oneself, one is clear; not deeming oneself right, one is distinguished; not boasting, one has merit; not self-aggrandizing, one endures—all arise from this. Is this not what is called “wholeness is what they return to”?

Xizhai’s Commentary:
Things cannot remain forever bent, thus bending preserves wholeness. Things cannot remain forever yielded, thus yielding becomes straight. Hollowing must lead to fullness; wearing out must lead to renewal. Less is easily attained; more is easily confused—this is the ultimate principle of fullness and emptiness.
The reason the sages of antiquity could be the ancestors of the myriad things is their embrace of the One. Embracing the One, they constantly align with the Dao. Thus, they do not see themselves but follow others’ sight; they do not deem themselves right but follow things’ rightness; they do not claim merit but follow others’ merit; they do not pride themselves on superiority but follow others’ superiority. Only by standing alone among things and not contending with them can none under heaven contend with them. The sage moves in accordance with principle, and one cannot find where they are not whole. Yet they can also attain bending to nurture it—thus their wholeness is perfect. This is called “truly, wholeness is what they return to.”

Hongfu’s Commentary:
Everyone desires wholeness, yet those who lose the way of preserving it often seek wholeness through wholeness and ultimately fail to attain it—this is the common folly of the world. They do not know that the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and hundred bones are utterly bent, yet people rely on them for wholeness. Without bending, wholeness cannot be achieved. Stretching a rope makes it straight, thus taking the rope as straight, yet not knowing its yielding. Without yielding, how could it be straight? The sea is hollow, yet always full; the sun and moon are old, yet always new. Drinking wine and eating meat in moderation brings satiety and comfort, but pursuing excess without end leads to vomiting and discomfort—this is confusion.
Knowing this, one knows the sage’s way of embracing the One. The One’s capacity for multiplicity is like the few’s capacity for attainment, the worn-out’s capacity for renewal, the hollow’s fullness, the yielded’s straightness, the bent’s wholeness—this is the principle of moving against the current. The sage’s model for the world lies herein; it is lamentable that people do not know it. From this perspective, those who study the Dao can turn back.
The eye is most clear, yet cannot see itself. If it were to see itself, it would not see clearly—how then could it be clear? Thus, not deeming oneself right, others must deem one right; not claiming merit, others must attribute merit; not priding oneself on superiority, others must regard one as superior; not contending, others must not contend with one—all are the way of bending and preserving wholeness. Alas! Who indeed can attain wholeness and return to it?

The *Brush Jottings* states:
To bend is to attain wholeness, to yield is to become straight, the hollow is filled, the worn-out is renewed—all illustrate how the few may obtain. The One is the extremity of the few. Embracing the One, the world takes it as a model, and thus its gains are many. Yet if one state has three rulers, none knows whom to follow; if ten sheep have nine herders, how can they find fodder? Those who lose their lives do so by pursuing many paths; those who lose their sheep suffer from too many forks in the road.

Rare words arise naturally.
A whirlwind does not last the morning;
a sudden storm does not last the day.
What brings these about? Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure them—
how much less can man?
Thus, those who engage with the Dao:
those who align with the Dao become one with the Dao,
those who align with virtue become one with virtue,
those who align with loss become one with loss.
Those who become one with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them;
those who become one with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them;
those who become one with loss—loss delights in obtaining them.
Where trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.

*(Annotations: "Whirlwind" denotes swift wind; "sudden storm" denotes violent rain. From dawn to dusk is "lasting the morning"; from early to late is "lasting the day." Wind and rain shake and surge, fleeting and impermanent—they cannot endure. As the *Yellow Emperor* said: "Excess brings harm; response brings control." "Delights" is read in the entering tone.)*

Su’s commentary:
Words that arise from the natural are simple and hit the mark; those not arising from the natural, when forced, become verbose and hard to trust. Thus it is said: "The Dao in speech is bland, without flavor—seen, it is not enough to be visible; heard, it is not enough to be audible; used, it cannot be exhausted." This is what is meant by "rare words."
Yin and yang do not contend; wind and rain arrive in their time, neither too swift nor too slow, exhausting their momentum before ceasing. But when yang is excessive above and yin is suppressed below, blocked and unable to release, there arise whirlwinds and sudden storms, as if unable to endure—yet their force cannot last the day. The sages of old spoke sparingly and acted plainly, all following the natural, and thus endured without exhaustion. Yet the world may grow weary of them, deeming them less pleasing than clever rhetoric or shocking conduct, unaware that such things cannot last. Confucius said: "If one is truly devoted to benevolence..."

Those who harbor no malice—this is what is meant by "the faults of the benevolent are easily forgiven." If one devoted to benevolence is thus, how much more so for one devoted to the Dao? If one truly engages in the practice of the Dao, then what one does in accord with the Dao attains the Dao; what one does in accord with virtue attains virtue. Even if one errs in misfortune, though the error lies in action, there must still be attainment in Dao and virtue. Those who do not understand the Dao, though they profess faith in it, do so without conviction; when they encounter failure, they grow doubtful, and thus their disbelief only deepens. Only those who understand the Dao do not allow success or failure to sow doubt in it.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
What is heard yet inaudible is called "rare words." To know the source of such speech is to speak from wordless speech, and thus what is heard becomes inaudible. Therefore, "rare words" are words spoken through the Dao. Hence it is said: "naturally." Whirlwinds and sudden storms arise from violence and disorder, not from the constant and regular. Thus, though heaven and earth produce them, they cannot last even a morning or a day. If human speech does not arise from the natural, it will be excessive and quickly exhausted—no wonder. Only those who engage in the practice of the Dao can achieve selflessness. Selflessness is the Dao, is virtue, is even loss.

I see no difference in them—thus those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao, those who align with virtue are one with virtue, and those who align with loss are one with loss. The strange, the cunning, the bizarre, and the wondrous all become one. Only when one perceives no difference and unites with them does their strangeness, though present, never depart from me.

Thus it is said: those who are one with the Dao, the Dao embraces; those who are one with virtue, virtue embraces; those who are one with loss, loss embraces. Only when trust is insufficient does one distinguish between Dao, virtue, and loss.

**Bi Sheng’s Commentary:**
The Dao regards spontaneity as supreme, yet the world rarely speaks of it, preferring contrivance. Where there is contrivance, there must be cessation—how could it endure? Even whirlwinds and sudden storms cannot last long; this is evident. Those who engage in the Dao are not so. To engage in the Dao is to be spontaneous. Being spontaneous, there is fundamentally nothing to gain, nor anything to lose. Without gain or loss, one follows the world’s gains and losses—thus whether it becomes virtue or loss, one trusts what arises without reservation. There is no difference, and thus no lack of joy—this is the principle.

When there is no difference, even seeking trust becomes impossible, let alone distrust. If one departs from the Dao to pursue virtue, one cannot be one with loss. If one departs from virtue to pursue loss, one cannot be one with virtue. Unable to be one with virtue or loss, how can one hope to be one with the Dao? This is like seeking ears on grain—precisely what is meant by "trust is insufficient, and thus there is distrust."

All are like the fleeting whirlwind and sudden storm. Some may ask: *"The Śūraṅgama Sūtra speaks of neither causation nor spontaneity, yet the Laozi takes spontaneity as its core—is there a difference?"* I say: there is no difference.

What is despised in spontaneity is that it has a source from which it arises and a reason for which it is so. If it has a source from which it arises and a reason for which it is so, then it is not spontaneity—it exists above things and emerges below the non-thing, which is what the Śākya school condemns. Yet the Old Master clarifies spontaneity, saying: *"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth."* To know the nameless is to know its spontaneity. There is no "self" in its spontaneity, no "self" in its "thusness." Without a "self" in its "thusness," how can causation or conditions confine it? Thus it is said: *"Pure awareness, wondrous and luminous, is neither cause nor condition, neither spontaneous nor non-spontaneous—detached from all appearances, it is all dharmas."* This is what is meant by *"the constant Dao that cannot be spoken."*

One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who strides cannot walk. One who displays himself is not enlightened; one who asserts himself is not distinguished; one who boasts achieves no merit; one who is self-conceited does not endure. In the Dao, these are called *"leftover food and parasitic growths"*—things that others despise. Therefore, one who embodies the Dao does not abide in them.

*(Annotations in the original: "跂 is interchangeable with 企, meaning to stand on tiptoe. 薛云: lifting the heels is called 跂; stretching the feet is called 跨. To stand, one seeks greater height, yet this harms one’s stability; to walk, one seeks greater stride, yet this harms one’s progress. 赘 is an excrescence; 行 here should be read as 形, as the characters were interchangeable in ancient script. Leftover food is despised by others; parasitic growths are deemed unsightly. As the Zuozhuan says: *'People will not eat my leftovers.'* Zhuangzi speaks of *'hanging growths and attached tumors—emerging from form yet exceeding nature.'* 恶 is read in the falling tone; 处 in the rising tone.)*

Su Dongpo’s commentary:
*"No one is incapable of standing or walking. Yet if one deems standing insufficient and adds tiptoeing, or deems walking insufficient and adds striding, one will inevitably lose one’s ability to stand or walk. Those who display themselves, assert themselves, boast, or are self-conceited are no different. It is like eating: when one is just full, that is enough; excess leads to illness. Or like the body: when it is whole, that is enough; growths become burdens."*

Lü Huiqing’s commentary:
*"Standing on tiptoe is not the natural way of standing; striding is not the natural way of walking. Thus, they cannot endure. Though one may stand, one does not truly stand; though one may walk, one does not truly walk."*

The Dao is fundamentally without self; without self, there is no contention. Thus, those who display themselves, assert themselves, or are self-conceited do not abide in the constant Way. Therefore, their so-called "Dao" is but surplus food and superfluous conduct—what the common people all crave. Yet if I, too, were to take it up, it would be surplus food indeed. Nature originally has no such thing, and to indulge in it is superfluous conduct. Surplus food and superfluous conduct—some things detest them, so the Dao should not reside in them. The Dao resides where the multitude detests, yet it is said, "Some things detest it," so why does the man of Dao not reside there? It is because humility, emptiness, softness, and weakness are what the multitude detests and shuns. Thus, the man of Dao resides in them. Those who are self-displaying and contentious are what the multitude detests and competes with, so he does not reside in them. Whether he resides or not, his non-contention remains the same.

*Xizhai’s commentary:*
Stone stands without feet; wind moves without feet—this is because the one who stands does not know he stands, and the one who walks does not know he walks. Feet not touching the ground is called *qi*; feet overstepping in walking is called *kua*. Standing on tiptoe cannot last; striding cannot endure. The ancients who studied the Dao preserved their heavenly nature, and when they encountered things, their responses arose without deliberation—like the hands, feet, ears, and eyes, which inwardly respond to the heart without being commanded. If one were to make the hands, feet, ears, and eyes think before responding, then in every action, one would not know what to do. Thus, those who display themselves are not enlightened; those who assert themselves are not illustrious; those who boast achieve no merit; those who are self-conceited do not endure—all because they have a self-centered mind. To study the Dao while having a self-centered mind is to be like surplus food and superfluous conduct. Eating is for satiety; walking is for purpose. Once full, the excess of fine meats and grains before one only makes one fear they cannot be taken away. When walking does not serve its purpose, even the integrity of Zhongzi or the fidelity of Weisheng become detestable. Thus, the surplus of food and the superfluity of conduct—these two are what some things detest, yet the man of Dao always follows what is natural. Therefore, his eating is not excessive, and his conduct is not superfluous.

There is a thing, formless yet complete,
Born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void,
It stands alone and does not change,
Goes round and does not weary.
It may be called the Mother of all things.
I do not know its name;
I style it "Dao."
Forced to give it a name, I call it "Great."
Great, it passes on;
Passing on, it becomes remote;
Remote, it returns.
Thus, the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth;
Earth models itself on heaven;
Heaven models itself on the Dao;
The Dao models itself on nature.

*Su’s commentary:*
The Dao is neither clear nor turbid, neither high nor low, neither coming nor going, neither good nor evil—it is blended into a single body, and in man, it is called nature. Thus, it is said, "There is a thing, formless yet complete." No one knows its origin, for it abides in stillness and constancy, and heaven and earth are born within it. Silent and without sound, void and without form, it stands alone without peer and never changes. It moves through all things and never wearies. Bending down, it nurtures and fosters the myriad things, and thus may be called their Mother. The Dao is originally nameless, but the sage, seeing that nothing does not proceed from it, names it "Dao." Seeing that nothing surpasses it, he forces a name upon it and calls it "Great." Yet in truth, it cannot be named. Seeking it from the great, it passes on and departs. Seeking it from departure, it becomes remote and unattainable. Though it passes on and becomes remote, returning to seek it, one finds it in the heart alone. Speaking of the Dao, even heaven, earth, and the king are not truly great. Yet the world is accustomed to knowing the greatness of these three and does not believe in the greatness of the Dao. Therefore, it is stated plainly: man does not surpass earth, earth does not surpass heaven, heaven does not surpass the Dao, and the Dao does not surpass nature. Yet if man were to recover his nature for a single day, these three would all be fully realized within him.

*Lü’s commentary:*
There is *qi*, there is form, there is substance—and thus the positions of heaven, earth, and man can be heard, seen, and grasped.

The faculties of ear, eye, and heart distinguish things, yet they have never perceived *qi*, form, or substance. *Qi*, form, and substance are undifferentiated and inseparable—seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard, grasped yet unobtainable. Thus, their form cannot be perceived. Therefore, I know not its name and designate it by its meaning, calling it the *Dao*. I know not its name, yet with the heart I comprehend it; I call it the *Dao* because its meaning can be spoken.

As a thing, the *Dao*: when employed, it fills the six directions; when abandoned, none know its whereabouts. How could "greatness" suffice to name it? Yet we force a name upon it—calling it "great." Greatness pervades all without ceasing, not confined to this body alone. Thus, "great" is called "passing on." Passing on, it becomes remote and uncontainable; thus, "passing on" is called "remote." Remote and uncontainable, I seek its bounds yet cannot find them. Yet returning to its root, it has never departed from this body. Thus, "remote" is called "return."

The *Dao* is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great—these are the "Four Greats" within the realm. The king is one who restores destiny and knows constancy; being accommodating, he becomes impartial; being impartial, he becomes kingly. Thus, within the realm there are Four Greats, and the king occupies one of them. The king is the fulfillment of the human *Dao*. Man, possessing form, unites with the formless; so too does earth. Where earth reaches, man reaches as well. Thus, it is said: "Man models himself on earth." Where heaven reaches, earth reaches as well. Thus, it is said: "Earth models itself on heaven." Where the *Dao* reaches, heaven reaches as well. Thus, it is said: "Heaven models itself on the *Dao*." The *Dao* is self-originating and self-rooted; before heaven and earth existed, it was already firmly established from ancient times. That which takes "no-method" as its method—this is spontaneity alone. Thus, it is said: "The *Dao* models itself on spontaneity."

*Xizhai’s commentary:*
To call it "a thing" is unnameable; to call it "undifferentiated" is unmodifiable. Born before heaven and earth, it shows no beginning; showing no beginning, its end is unknown. Without beginning or end, it stands alone yet unchanging. Though it stands alone, it is never truly alone—it pervades the ten thousand things, entering all without peril or exhaustion. The things of the world are born through it without cease; thus, it may be called the Mother of the World. Yet to call it "standing alone" is not standing alone; to call it "pervading all" is not pervading all; to call it the "Mother of the World" is not the Mother of the World. I know not its name, so I call it the *Dao*, forcing the name "great" upon it. Yet its greatness is never seen as great, for it is ever-transforming. Thus, it is called "passing on." To call it "passing on" is not passing on, for it never departs and pervades all without exception. Thus, it is called "remote." To call it "remote" is not remote, for in a single thought it contains all. Thus, it is called "return." From its greatness it can pass on; from its remoteness it can return. Therefore, it is neither great nor minute, neither remote nor near—all names fail to capture it. This is called the *Dao*.

When the *Dao* descends to generate things, heaven and earth divide, and the Four Greats within the realm emerge. By worldly standards, the king’s greatness does not match that of heaven and earth, and heaven and earth’s greatness does not match that of the *Dao*. Yet here it is said the Four Greats include the king as one—thus equating the king with the *Dao*, as if it were effortless. If even the emotions of a single person—joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—can align with heaven and earth and govern the ten thousand things, how much more so for a king? If one can turn and model oneself: man on earth, earth on heaven, heaven on the *Dao*—then how could it be difficult for the king to match the *Dao*?

*Li Yue’s commentary:*
"The *Dao* is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great"—these are the Four Greats within the realm. The king models himself on earth, heaven, and the *Dao*, governing the world through spontaneity. The world finds peace through this, hence it is called "modeling." When speaking of "man," it refers to the king; its meaning is to model earth (earth’s impartial bearing), model heaven (heaven’s impartial covering), and model the *Dao* (the *Dao*’s impartial generation and completion)—like the examples of ruler as ruler, minister as minister, father as father, son as son.

Later scholars have mistakenly transmitted that "man models earth, earth models heaven, heaven models the *Dao*, the *Dao* models spontaneity," making the Four Greats into Five. How could the king only model earth and not model heaven or the *Dao*? Can heaven and earth, being without intent, also model one another? Moreover, if earth models heaven, heaven models the *Dao*, and the *Dao* models spontaneity, then the *Dao* becomes the father of heaven and earth, and spontaneity its child—fragmented, disjointed, and far from coherent principle.

Stillness is the root of motion; tranquility is the lord of restlessness. Therefore, the sage travels all day without departing from the heavy supply wagon. Though possessing splendid vistas and serene dwellings, he remains detached. How could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly before the world? Lightness loses the root; restlessness loses the lord.

Su's Annotation:
All things light cannot bear weight; small cannot restrain great; the unmovable makes the movable move; the unmoving governs the moving. Thus, light takes heaviness as its root, and restlessness takes stillness as its lord. In travel, one may desire lightness but must not depart from the heavy supply wagon. Though there be splendid vistas and serene dwellings, one must have a place of tranquil repose. The importance of heaviness and stillness cannot be lost in this way. If the ruler of the world treats his person lightly while bearing its weight, he is insufficient to bear the world. Lightness and restlessness are never admissible. If the lord is light, his ministers know he is not to be relied upon; if the lord is restless, his ministers know his mind is set on profit. Thus it is said: "Lightness loses the ministers; restlessness loses the lord."

Lü's Annotation:
The light responds first, the heavy responds later. The response arises from what is felt, so heaviness is the root of lightness. Stillness employs things; restlessness is employed by things. Restlessness is always employed by stillness, so stillness is the lord of restlessness. Therefore, though the noble person’s conduct throughout the day may be carried out with minimal provisions, he still does not depart from the heavy supply wagon—lightness cannot exist without heaviness. Though there be splendid vistas sufficient for contentment, he must have a place of supernal repose—restlessness cannot exist without stillness. If even daily conduct and splendid vistas are thus, how much more so for the lord of ten thousand chariots, who bears heavy responsibility and travels a long path in overseeing the world? Should he not be still and heavy? Only when compelled does he move; only when stirred does he respond; only when unavoidable does he rise—this is heaviness. Without action, he is still. If his movements are always at the point of being avoidable and he cannot be without action, then he treats his person lightly before the world and does not hold it in weight. Without weight, he is restless and not still. Thus it is said: "Above, there is no action; below, there is also no action." If below is in accord with above in virtue, then the ministers do not act as ministers. If below acts, then above also acts. If above is in accord with below in the Way, then the lord does not act as lord. For if the lord is light, he takes on the labor of his ministers and replaces them, while the ministers, acting without action, are in accord with the lord in the Way—thus they do not act as ministers. If they do not act as ministers, this is to lose the ministers. If the lord is restless, he forgets the dignity of his position and is used by the world. Then the lord also acts and is in accord with below in the Way—thus he does not act as lord. If he does not act as lord, this is to lose the lord. Thus it is said: "Lightness loses the ministers; restlessness loses the lord."

Xi Zhai's Annotation:
Lightness must return to heaviness; restlessness must return to stillness. Thus, heaviness is the root of lightness, and stillness is the lord of restlessness. The sage travels all day without departing from the heavy supply wagon, reaching everywhere without departing from his root. Though there be splendid vistas and tranquil repose, he remains supernally detached, acting without action. How can the lord of ten thousand chariots fail to measure his own weight and merely drive his person through the world’s trifles? If he entangles himself in trifles, a single thing is enough to employ him—how then can he govern the world? Though both lightness and restlessness are sufficient to cause harm, the harm of restlessness is more severe than that of lightness. For lightness employs the mind shallowly, while restlessness employs it deeply. The loss of lightness is limited to what is treated lightly, but the loss of restlessness disturbs the lord within, losing the wholeness of stillness. Thus, "lightness loses the ministers; restlessness loses the lord."

Hongfu's Annotation:
With the heavy supply wagon, though one travels all day, one is not light—why? Because heaviness is its root. With constant tranquil repose, though there be splendid vistas, one is not restless—why? Because stillness is its lord. Thus, lightness loses the root of heaviness; restlessness loses the lord of stillness.

In good conduct, there are no wheel tracks;
In good speech, there are no flaws;
In good planning, no counting rods are used;
In good closure, no bolts are needed yet it cannot be opened;
In good binding, no cords are used yet it cannot be undone.
Thus, the sage is always good at saving people, so there are no outcasts;
Always good at saving things, so there is nothing discarded.
This is called inheriting illumination.
Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;
The not-good person is the resource of the good.
Not to value one’s teacher,
Not to love one’s resource—
Though knowing, this is great delusion.
This is called the essential subtlety.

Su's Annotation:
Moving in accord with principle, there are no tracks. Speaking at the proper time, one’s words fill the world without fault. The numbers of the myriad things are all arrayed before one—knowing without calculation, what need is there for counting rods? The person of complete virtue, in relation to the myriad things, is like a mother to her child: though she lets them go, they do not depart. Thus, without bolts, he can close; without cords, he can bind. Those who rely on counting rods to plan, set bolts to close, and use cords to bind—their strength reaches only so far.

The sage, in relation to people, not only accommodates them but also skillfully saves them. If I do not cast people aside, how can they not return to me? To save people in times of danger and difficulty is not the greatest form of saving. When they are flowing and turning in the cycle of life and death, obscured by things, and I extend my utmost illumination to them, so that the dark all become bright—like a lamp passed on, transmitted without end—this is called skillfully saving people.

The sage has no mind to teach, so he does not love his resource; the world has no mind to learn, so it does not value its teacher. The sage not only forgets himself but also enables the world to forget him. This is the subtlety of the sage, which even the wise may not fully comprehend. Thus it is called the essential subtlety.

Lü's Annotation:
Where there are chariots, there are wheel tracks; where there are pedestrians, there are footprints—thus conduct cannot be without tracks. The knowing do not speak; the speaking do not know—thus speech cannot be without flaws. Knowing the source of conduct, conduct arises from non-conduct—thus, in good conduct, there are no wheel tracks. Knowing the source of speech, speech arises from non-speech—thus, in good speech, there are no flaws. One and speech become two; two and one become three. From this point onward, even the most skillful reckoner cannot calculate. Only one who attains the One and forgets speech can reach the numbers. Reaching the numbers, his plans cannot be exhausted. Thus it is said: "In good planning, no counting rods are used."

The gate of heaven has no opening or closing—it is within me. If I do not open it, who can open it? Thus it is said: "In good closure, no bolts are needed yet it cannot be opened." The world has constant principles. Binding does not rely on ropes and cords; it knots according to these constant principles. Thus it is said: "In good binding, no cords are used yet it cannot be undone." Therefore, if conduct does not proceed from this, it cannot be without wheel tracks; if speech does not proceed from this, it cannot be without flaws. This is the calculation.

Closing and binding—if not proceeding from this, then even with counting rods there is chaos; even with bolts there is opening; even with cords there is unraveling. What resides within oneself cannot be without decay—how then could one save others? The sage alone embodies the Dao to master these five arts, and thus is ever adept at saving people without abandoning anyone, ever adept at saving things without abandoning anything.

Why? These five arts share the same principle of inherent nature and destiny. Only the sage, with the clarity of one who knows the constant, saves others at the very point of their shared nature.

In walking, speaking, planning, closing, and binding—none know their underlying principle. Thus their clarity is concealed and cannot be perceived. This is called "concealed clarity." Only through such saving is it so.

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good; the not-good person is the resource of the good. How could the wise abandon those who are not good? Yet though one aspires to the Dao, the mind is forgotten. Though the good person may be the teacher of the not-good, I do not know that such teaching is to be prized. Though the not-good person may be the resource of the good, I do not know that such a resource is to be cherished. If one does not prize the teacher nor cherish the resource, then even the wise will have realms they cannot know and will wander far astray.

Only by seeking with wisdom and not attaining does one grasp the subtlety of this Dao. Thus it is said: "Even the wise are greatly deluded—this is called subtlety."

**Dong’s Commentary:**
Wheels rolling on earth leave tracks—how could one united with the Dao leave traces? Faults arise from deviation. Only by harmonizing with heaven’s natural articulation is there no error of speech. The Dao is one—it encompasses the myriad existences. This is called "good planning has no gates, no chambers, yet extends in all four directions." Even the vastness of heaven and earth cannot lie beyond it—this is called "good closure." The wondrous root is profoundly still, neither bound by dharmas nor seeking liberation from them. It is open and luminous, utterly without gaps—what cannot be departed from for even a moment.

If one is mired in deliberate effort, esteems conduct, clings to words, or stagnates in phrases, employing the mind to calculate and measure in pursuit of the Dao yet failing to reach the gateway of expedient means, then one is instead bound by doctrinal appearances and cannot thoroughly perceive the root of all dharmas. This is what is meant by "good binding"—it is simply non-action.

Saving people from peril and hardship merely rescues their form, and even then may not succeed—how could this be truly good? Only when others are attached to contrivance and deluded about their nature, lost in darkness, does one embrace them with all-embracing capacity, awakening them with prior awakening so that their own celestial light naturally emerges. Like the transmission of a bright lamp, it is inexhaustible. What one gives to others only increases, and thus its clarity knows no limit. Thus it is said: "Ever adept"—meaning there is no time when this is not so.

The *Xizhai Annotation* states:

In action, there are no traces without footprints; in speech, there are no flaws without utterance; in planning, there are no schemes without thought; in closure, there are no barriers without bolts; in binding, there are no knots without restraint. Only those who attain the Dao act without relying on their feet—thus leaving no wheel tracks. They speak without relying on their mouths—thus incurring no faults or censure. They plan without relying on their minds—thus making no calculations. They close without relying on bolts—thus remaining unopenable. They bind without relying on restraint—thus remaining insoluble. This is because they take the ever-constant as their essence and master its wondrous application. Thus, they are capable of perfect goodness in all things.

The Dao of the ever-constant is possessed by every person and attained by every thing. Since it is called "constant," it does not increase with people nor diminish with things. Though both people and things possess this constancy, they lose its true essence. Therefore, the sage always employs true constancy to save them. By using true constancy to save people, no person is abandoned; by using true constancy to save things, no thing is abandoned. Yet how could the sage alone accomplish this? It is because both people and things inherently possess this clarity, and the sage merely reveals their original luminosity. Thus, it is said: "This is called inheriting clarity."

When inheriting clarity, all are equal in oneness. Since people are neither inherently good nor inherently not good, the good person becomes the teacher of the not-good—meaning the not-good can become good. The not-good person becomes the resource of the good—meaning the not-good originally share the same nature as the good.

If one does not honor their teacher nor follow their goodness, does not cherish their resource yet willingly embraces evil, then even with great wisdom, they only deepen their delusion—turning away from the root and returning to the origin is called the essential subtlety.

Cheng Ju’s Discourse:
Good conduct, good words, good plans, good closures, good knots—all are constant goodness. Only constant goodness can save people without abandoning anyone, save things without abandoning anything. Could deliberate goodness achieve this? Only by having no accumulation can one give to others while growing oneself, give to others while increasing oneself. Can offerings bound by form achieve this? Extending this Dao to aid the world and ferry all beings—what distinction then remains between Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism?

Hongfu’s Annotation:
To claim possession of a method to save others is to abandon them. The sage, having no "saving," thus saves well. Therefore: without barriers, one excels in closure; without constraints, one excels in knotting; without defenses, one excels in planning; without deceit, one excels in speech; without trace, one excels in conduct—all can be known.

Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, becoming the world’s valley-stream.
As the world’s valley-stream, constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of an infant.
Know the white, yet guard the black, becoming the world’s model.
As the world’s model, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless.
Know glory, yet guard disgrace, becoming the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to simplicity.
When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; the sage employs it to become a leader.
Thus, great regulation is not division.

[Annotations: *守* means to preserve; *复* means to return; *溪* and *谷* are where all waters gather, signifying the world’s utmost receptivity; *式* means model; *忒* means deviation; *足* means fulfillment; *长* is read in the rising tone; *制* means to regulate; *割* means to divide.]

Lü’s Annotation:
The masculine moves while the feminine is still; the masculine is firm while the feminine is yielding; the masculine initiates while the feminine harmonizes. To know the masculine yet guard the feminine is to be profoundly still, utterly yielding, and non-initiating. Thus, one becomes the world’s valley-stream—a thing that receives from the valley and channels to rivers and seas, accepting without refusal, discharging without accumulation, capable of unimpeded flow. Such capacity ensures constant virtue does not depart.

At birth, humans possess complete constant virtue, unobstructed by things. Yet when swayed by external things, they daily drift further from it. Only by being profoundly still, utterly yielding, and non-initiating can constant virtue remain undeparted, returning to the state of an infant.

White, in color, is receptive; in things, it is brightness; in conduct, it is metal; in numbers, it is four. Black, in color, is untainted; in things, it is obscurity; in conduct, it is water; in numbers, it is one. To know the white yet guard the black is to remain unstained by the myriad things, as if obscure, as if water. Ultimately, this is to embrace the One. Embracing the One, one can be flexible, yielding, hollow, and lowly—thus becoming the world’s model. As the world’s model, there is nowhere the One is not present, so constant virtue does not err.

"Not departing" means not leaving one’s original state, yet this does not necessarily prevent error. "Not erring" means no deviation.

The infant, as a thing, concentrates its qi to achieve suppleness, preserving only the harmony of its singular body—yet to return to the limitless is beyond even the infant’s state.

The flourishing of plants is their glory; their withering, their disgrace. What humans call glory and disgrace is no different. Knowing glory yet guarding disgrace, shedding ornament to return to the root—even if burdened with what the world most reviles, one cannot be encumbered. Thus, one becomes the world’s valley. The valley, as a thing, is hollow yet able to fill, responsive yet not hoarding—whence the source of rivers and seas arises. To be the world’s valley is to return to one’s source.

Thus, constant virtue is not merely unerring but returns to the uncarved block. The uncarved block is the wholeness of the real, the undifferentiated state of things. Only in its undifferentiated state, not yet shaped into vessels, can it be great or small, bent or straight, short or long, round or square—nothing it cannot become. Even the limitless is insufficient to describe it.

Yet to guard the feminine, guard the black, guard disgrace—this is enough. Why seek to know the masculine, the white, or glory? For guarding is the mother, knowing is the child; guarding is the constant, knowing is the variable.

When the uncarved block scatters, it becomes vessels. Vessels, as things, can be great but not small, bent but not straight, short but not long, round but not square. Thus, the sage employs them as officials and leaders—this is not tolerance but impartiality, impartiality the Dao of kingship.

As for embracing the uncarved block to govern the world, one regards the world’s principles as a butcher regards an ox—never seeing the whole ox. Acting where there is no affair, how vast is the space for the blade’s play!

To what end would one carve it? Thus it is said: *"Great governance requires no carving."*

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
The masculine moves and acts; the feminine remains still and abides. Movement must return to stillness; the masculine must return to the feminine. Thus it becomes the valley of the world. The white seeks knowledge; the black seeks non-knowledge. To possess knowledge yet value non-knowledge, to know the white yet guard the black—this is wisdom. Thus it becomes the model for the world. Glory is what I impose upon others; disgrace is what others impose upon me. If I impose upon others and they can bear it, the benefit lies with them. If others impose upon me and I can bear it, the benefit lies with me. Thus it becomes the valley of the world. Yet how could the constant Dao truly possess what we call masculine and feminine, white and black, glory and disgrace?

To know and to guard are not the constant virtue. When the uncarved block scatters into virtue, and one conducts oneself by this virtue—if one employs the masculine, the white, or glory, one loses the constant virtue. But if one employs the feminine, the constant virtue does not depart, and one returns to the state of an infant. If one employs the black, the constant virtue remains unerring, and one returns to the boundless. If one employs disgrace, the constant virtue becomes complete, and one returns to the uncarved block. What we call the infant, the boundless, and the uncarved block—these are the true and constant.

Thus, the true and constant cannot be known or guarded. Only by making what can be known and guarded return to the constant can one attain the Dao. When the uncarved block scatters into vessels, the sage governs these vessels by the Dao, never losing the Dao. Therefore, employing them as officials and leaders means regarding the world as officials and leaders do—not treating it as a private household. Thus, to govern without partiality, to lead without domination—this is called *"great governance requires no carving."*

**Chunfu’s Annotation:**
This speaks of the sage’s way of wielding the insubstantial to govern the substantial, the subtle and wondrous Dao of the mysterious. "Knowing" refers to the knowledge of the child; it carries the meaning of application. "Guarding" refers to the guarding of the mother; it carries the meaning of mastery. Masculine and feminine are spoken of in terms of hardness and softness; black and white in terms of brightness and obscurity; glory and disgrace in terms of nobility and baseness. The valley lies below, where all streams converge—this is the meaning of "model," the sense of returning to it. "Constant virtue" is the truly constant virtue. The infant speaks of harmony; the boundless speaks of emptiness; the uncarved block speaks of substance.

All these refer to constant virtue. This chapter varies its phrasing and harmonizes its rhymes, repeatedly chanted and intoned—it thus aligns with poetic form. Having said "guard the feminine to become the valley," it further states "constant virtue does not depart," reiterating that there is no additional effort of non-departure *after* becoming the valley. Having said "constant virtue does not depart," it further states "return to the infant," elaborating that beyond constant virtue, there is no separate infant to return to. The two examples below follow this pattern.

For the affairs of the world cannot be managed by softness alone—there are times when hardness must be employed. They cannot be governed by obscurity alone—there are times when clarity must be used. They cannot be accomplished solely by baseness and lowliness—there are times when one must be above. This is why the sage must know the masculine, know the white, know the glorious. Yet hardness does not arise from hardness but from softness; clarity does not arise from clarity but from obscurity; nobility does not arise from nobility but from baseness. Thus, hardness, clarity, and nobility are the branches of things, the child—far from the Dao. Softness, obscurity, and baseness are the roots of things, the mother—close to the Dao. This is why the sage must guard the feminine, guard the black, guard the humble.

The sage guards these, and thus the mother of the world resides within. Where then would the child go? This is why it is called the valley, the gorge, the model—why the world returns to it. It is precisely because this truly constant virtue has never departed. When constant virtue does not depart, even when employing utmost hardness to decide the world’s affairs, utmost clarity to illuminate its circumstances, or utmost nobility to oversee its lowly, one acts without presumption, leads without domination, achieves success without dwelling in it—never failing to return to the root.

The sage’s possession of the world without attachment stems from this. The infant, the boundless, the uncarved block—these are the inherent Dao of humanity, hence the emphasis on "returning." Officials and leaders are the superiors of all administrators. The uncarved block can be carved into vessels, but vessels cannot become the uncarved block. Leaders can govern all administrators, but administrators cannot become leaders. The sage acts as the mother, not the child—just as they act as the uncarved block, not the vessel; as the leader, not the administrator. They merely secure the root. Otherwise, pursuing the child while forgetting the mother, endlessly chasing the masculine, the white, the glorious, clashing and grinding against things without cease—how could one then govern oneself, let alone the world’s return?

**"Those who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it."**

Thus, things may proceed or follow, warm or blow, strengthen or weaken, uphold or destroy. Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity.

**Su’s Annotation:**
The sage’s possession of the world is not a matter of seizing it—all things return to them, and they accept it out of necessity. In governing the world, they do not act upon it but remove its harms by following the natural course of all things. If one seeks to seize and act upon it, it cannot be attained. Nothing can be forced. Even a gathering of a hundred people, if not following its natural course but acting recklessly, will inevitably face discord and resistance—how much more so with the world?

Though small things with few people may still be seized by force or cunning, when it comes to the vastness of the world, with its divine essence, if one does not await its natural return, there will be rebellion; if one does not allow its natural governance, there will be chaos. Yin and yang interact, high and low incline, great and small influence one another—some lead, some follow; some warm, some chill; some strengthen, some weaken; some uphold, some destroy. These are the natural tendencies of things, the inevitable course of events.

The foolish, driven by self-interest and desire for gain, seek to resist and defy this course—disaster will befall them, either ruin or fracture. Only the sage knows it cannot be opposed and thus awaits it with compliance. They eliminate excess, eliminate extravagance, eliminate extremity, preventing things from going too far and harming others—thus the world remains free of calamity. This is the ultimate non-action.

Even Yao and Tang could not avoid floods and droughts, yet they never faced ruin—this is the reason. The *Yi Jing*’s *Tai* hexagram states: *"The ruler, in accordance with the Dao of heaven and earth, assists and harmonizes their proper order, thereby guiding the people."* With three yang lines within and three yin lines without, things reach their utmost flourishing. The sage fears excess and harm, so they regulate and assist, ensuring it does not go too far—this is what is meant by eliminating excess, extravagance, and extremity.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The sage embraces simplicity in governing the world, thus *"great governance requires no carving."* Their way of taking the world is always through non-interference. To "take" means to win the hearts of the world so they do not depart. Thus, those who would take the world by acting upon it do not truly take it. Those who take it without such means—I see they will not succeed.

What is above form is called the Dao; what is below form is called the vessel. The world as a vessel is a sacred vessel. Only the divine Dao can govern the sacred vessel. The divine is without thought, without action—acting upon it is not the proper way to govern it. Thus, it cannot be acted upon. Those who act seek completion but only bring ruin; those who grasp seek attainment but only incur loss.

Yao did not possess people, yet people saw him as majestic. Shun and Yu possessed the world yet did not claim it. All these truly knew how to take the world—not by acting or grasping. Thus, all things have those that proceed and those that follow, those that warm and those that blow, those that strengthen and those that weaken, those that uphold and those that destroy—the mutual arising of circumstances leaves no alternative. How then can one grasp and act upon it?

Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity—merely assisting the self-so of all things, never daring to act.

**Yuanze’s Annotation:**
The perfected person embodies spirit and merges with change, becoming one with things. Though ruling all under heaven, they never possess—thus they act with effortless ease, and no undertaking fails. They mold emperors and kings as if shaping chaff or clay. But those who stubbornly cling to possession and impose their will upon things—even a body of six feet becomes cumbersome, as if it could scarcely move. How much more so for all under heaven? Those who seize do so by taking things as their own; those who act do so by contriving—both are bound to the self and its doings. Such people dwell amid constant anxiety; how could they govern others?

The sage’s mind transcends being and non-being, never objectifying things. Thus, when yin and yang alternate, their principle remains unchanged. If one insists on possession, things become adversaries, and the myriad transformations tangle beyond reckoning. Therefore, to walk alone ahead without knowing followers trail behind is like form and shadow never parting. To exhale in warmth without knowing the blower’s chill arrives is like cold and heat arising in turn. To know only strength is to invite weakness in time; to know only bearing is to summon collapse in response. All this is the great truth of creation, the constant pattern of dawn and dusk. Those who cling to possession do not understand its origin, nor do they comprehend its nature—thus they suffer these afflictions and contend with them. In this way, even the slightest defense against a single thing fills heaven and earth with vast anxiety. How could one wield the sacred vessel without burden?

The sage’s mind merges with the non-being that responds to the myriad changes. In their actions, they do not rely on fixed plans, like a mirror reflecting forms—just enough, then stopping. Matters beyond their scope are left undone. Those who cling to possession deludedly perceive appearances, pride themselves on their abilities, and delight in endless doing—thus their affairs always exceed bounds. This stems from ignorance of the reciprocity between proceeding and following, exhaling and blowing, strengthening and weakening, bearing and collapsing.

---

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
The sage embodies the Dao as their essence and, unavoidably, takes form within heaven and earth. Since the world cannot be governed without the sage, they unavoidably take up its rule. Yet the sage regards this body as a temporary lodging, and all under heaven as entrusted to their care. How could they force what they lack and lose the true, constant Dao?

Those who do not understand the Dao treat the world as something real and themselves as its ruler—thus they act, disturb it with possession, and cling to things, unaware that their actions only bring ruin, and their grasping only incurs loss. For in the world, some things proceed while others follow, some exhale warmth while others blow cold, some grow strong while others weaken, some bear while others collapse—this is the nature of things, their inherent condition. If one insists on acting and grasping, forcing the proceeding to follow, the exhaling to blow, the strong to weaken, the bearing to collapse—even heaven could not endure it, let alone a person.

The sage follows the natural, knowing what they receive cannot be altered. They only eliminate excess, extravagance, and extremity, ensuring that what can proceed, exhale, strengthen, or bear does not go too far, while what follows, blows, weakens, or collapses does not fall short. This is called using one’s naturalness to assist the naturalness of things.

---

**Xue’s Annotation:**
Things each have their natural disposition—how could contrivance harm them? Thus, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extremity, merely following their self-so. What the sage calls "excess," "extravagance," and "extremity" does not refer to the extravagant excesses of later ages. Anything that adds contrivance beyond simplicity falls into this category. The *Book of Han*’s *Biography of Huang Ba* states, "In governing, one must eliminate what is extreme and excessive." Though the words derive from this, the meaning differs. If a matter is slightly excessive, remove the excess—small and harmless, it need not be altered. This is the intent of the Han scholars. Things have their inherent nature; one cannot force them. Affairs have their proper measure; one cannot exceed it. This is the original meaning of Laozi.

One who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use weapons to dominate the world, for such affairs swiftly return. Where armies camp, brambles grow; after great wars, years of famine follow. The good achieve their aim and stop—daring not seize strength. Achieving their aim, they do not boast; achieving their aim, they do not vaunt; achieving their aim, they do not arrogate; achieving their aim, they act out of necessity; achieving their aim, they do not force. Things in their prime inevitably age—this is called "not the Dao." What is not the Dao perishes early.

---

**Su’s Annotation:**
When the sage uses weapons, it is always out of necessity. If not out of necessity but seeking to dominate the world by force, though they may prevail, calamity will inevitably return. King Ling of Chu, Duke Min of Qi, the First Emperor of Qin, and Emperor Wu of Han—some died by the sword, others brought disaster to their descendants. What people abhor, ghosts detest—none have escaped. Where armies go, the people’s affairs are neglected, so fields lie fallow. After war, killing energy prevails, so harvests fail. This is true of all warfare, but how much more so for those who dominate the world by force?

"Achieving their aim" means resolving what virtue cannot pacify and governance cannot subdue—only then, out of necessity, do they use weapons to decide it. "Do not boast, do not vaunt, do not arrogate, act out of necessity"—these four are how one avoids forcing. Things in their prime inevitably age—nothing is exempt. Only the man of the Dao, though complete, seems lacking; though full, seems empty. He has never been in his prime, so he has never aged, never dominated the world by force. To dominate the world by force is extreme primacy—how could it not age? How could it not perish?

---

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The ruler is one who does not act; the one who assists the ruler is one who acts. To take the world cannot be done without action, and if this action is unceasing, it leads to dominating by force. Though the assistant acts, they still do not follow the Dao—how much less the ruler, who embodies the non-acting Dao?

The reason is that such affairs swiftly return. If one uses the Dao to serve the world, the world dares not resist. But if one uses weapons to dominate the world, others will resist.

What emerges from you will return to you. Where armies encamp, brambles grow; in the wake of great armies, famine years follow. The poison of armies spreads thus through the world—therefore, the skilled commander achieves only decisive victory. "Decisive" means overcoming the enemy. To overcome the enemy is to launch an attack from Mingtiao, as when Tang overcame Jie from Bo. This is what it means to overcome the enemy. Such action arises from necessity, not from reliance on force. Be decisive but do not boast of your ability; be decisive but do not vaunt your achievement; be decisive but do not grow arrogant in your power. Such decisiveness always arises from necessity—this is the Dao of decisiveness without force. If, however, you are decisive and boast of your ability, decisive and vaunt your achievement, decisive and grow arrogant in your power, then your decisiveness arises from force, not from necessity.

All things, when young, grow strong; when strong, they age—this is the nature of things. The Dao values holding to softness as strength, for this is how one endures without peril. If you dominate the world by force, you abandon softness and employ strength. But strength must age—this is merely the way of things. How could it be the Dao’s way of shaping things? Thus it is said: "When things grow strong, they age. This is called not following the Dao. What does not follow the Dao perishes early."

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
If you kill a man’s father, his son will kill yours; if you kill a man’s elder brother, his younger brother will kill yours—this is called "what goes around comes around." The harms of war cannot be easily enumerated. Even if, by chance, you prevail, the vengeful qi of slaughter will ensure the earth cannot make things grow and heaven cannot bring harmony. Thus, brambles grow where troops have camped, and famine follows in the wake of armies—how much greater, then, are the harms that cannot be overcome. Therefore, the skilled commander acts only out of necessity, decisive in a single strike but never relying on this to gain strength. "Decisive" means not prolonging the conflict. Internally, he holds to the mind of necessity; externally, he executes a single, conclusive strike. Thus, he never boasts, never grows arrogant, never vaunts his achievement, never relies on force—all arises from necessity. If he could have refrained but did not, his strength will age and his qi decline, just as a man’s strength must age. This is called "not following the Dao." A man who does not follow the Dao may not live out his years—how much less can an army’s strength endure?

**Hongfu’s Annotation:**
The Dao of heaven favors return, yet those who assist rulers by dominating with force do not understand the Dao. Knowing that force cannot be relied upon, they should desist—but without resolute decisiveness, they cannot. Only the truly skilled can be decisive. Thus, the text repeatedly warns against the dangers of decisiveness, guarding deeply against them. "When things grow strong, they age"—this is the Dao of heaven. To rely on strength without knowing that decline will follow is called "not following the Dao." Affairs that do not follow the Dao cannot but end early.

Now, fine weapons are inauspicious tools—some despise them. Therefore, the man of the Dao does not dwell with them. The noble man, in peacetime, values the left; in war, he values the right. Weapons are inauspicious tools, not the tools of the noble man. When he must use them, he does so with utmost restraint. Victory is not to be celebrated; to celebrate it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their will in the world.

Auspicious affairs value the left; inauspicious affairs value the right. The deputy general stands on the left; the supreme general stands on the right—this means that, in positions of power, they are treated with mourning rites. When many are killed, mourn them with sorrowful weeping. When victorious, treat it with mourning rites.

**Su’s Annotation:**
Using weapons to resolve crises but not making them a constant practice—this is called "not dwelling with them."

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Heaven and earth reveal civil virtues while concealing martial ones—this is the Dao of heaven and earth, the principle of yin and yang. To admire weapons is to treat inauspicious tools as fine, and things that some despise as desirable. Therefore, the man of the Dao does not dwell with them. Thus, the noble man, in peacetime, values the left; in war, he values the right—his values differ accordingly. In times of peace, he still does not treat weapons as fine tools, for they are not the tools of the noble man. He uses them only when unavoidable, valuing restraint above all. Thus, even in victory, he does not celebrate it—this is not how one admires weapons. Heaven protects and defends with compassion, for compassion is what the world delights in and never tires of. How could one who kills delight in it? To celebrate killing is to delight in it. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their will in the world.

Therefore, auspicious affairs value the left; inauspicious affairs value the right. The deputy general stands on the left; the supreme general stands on the right—this means treating them with mourning rites. When many are killed, mourn them with sorrowful weeping; when victorious, treat it with mourning rites. If you treat it with mourning rites, it is clear that these are inauspicious tools and that victory is not to be celebrated. If you mourn with sorrowful weeping, it is clear that you do not delight in killing.

Laozi’s understanding of ritual is profound—how could those who claim he sought to abolish ritual truly grasp his intent?

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
Weapons cannot be admired, just as men cannot be killed without cause. Only one who does not delight in killing can speak of warfare. Sunzi and Wu Qi’s treatises on war discuss assessing emptiness and fullness, distinguishing the orthodox and the unorthodox—their words are detailed. Yet the root of emptiness and fullness, the orthodox and the unorthodox, they surely understood. Laozi said: "Value restraint; even in victory, do not celebrate it." To speak of restraint in war may seem inadequate, but without restraint, stillness—stillness is the root of victory—gives way to recklessness, and recklessness is the foundation of defeat.

When Liang Xiang asked Mencius, "How can the world be settled?" Mencius replied, "It will be settled through unity." "Who can unify it?" "One who does not delight in killing." If one truly does not delight in killing, unifying the world would not be difficult. From ancient times to the present, those who do not delight in killing have always risen, while those who delight in killing have always perished. Those who delight in killing may achieve temporary success, but none have endured for long. Therefore, the noble man, when victorious, treats it with mourning rites—inasmuch as weapons are inauspicious tools, the man of the Dao does not dwell with them.

The eternal Dao has no name. Though the uncarved block is small, none in the world dare treat it as a subject. If lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will submit of their own accord. Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew; people, without command, find it evenly distributed. Only when the system of names begins do names arise. Once names exist, one must also know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys flowing into rivers and seas.

Wang Fusi’s commentary:
The Dao has no form and is not bound to constancy, so it cannot be named. Since the nameless is its constancy, it is said, “The eternal Dao has no name.” The uncarved block, as a thing, is without intent and without name; thus, to attain the Dao, nothing is better than holding to the uncarved. The wise can be made subjects; the brave can be employed in warfare; the skilled can be tasked with service; the strong can bear heavy burdens. But the uncarved block, as a thing, is simple and impartial, approaching nothingness—hence it is said, “none dare treat it as a subject.” Embracing simplicity and non-action, not allowing things to burden one’s true nature, not permitting desires to harm one’s spirit, the myriad things will submit of their own accord, and the Dao will naturally be attained. When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends without being sought. If I preserve my true nature and practice non-action, the people, without command, will find it evenly distributed.

“When the system begins” refers to the time when the uncarved block scatters and officials and leaders first emerge. If one then relies on names to designate things, the mother of governance is lost. Thus, knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. Valleys seek rivers and seas, yet rivers and seas do not summon them. Those who practice the Dao in the world do not command, yet it is evenly distributed; they do not seek, yet it is naturally attained. Therefore, it is said, “The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys flowing into rivers and seas.”

Su’s commentary:
“Uncarved” is nature.

The Dao is eternally nameless, and thus nature likewise cannot be named. As a thing, when it unfurls, it is present everywhere; when it contracts, it does not fill even a hair’s tip—this is why, though small, it cannot be subjugated. Thus, when a commoner of lowly station preserves it, even dust, chaff, and husks suffice to mold and forge a Yao or Shun; yet when a lord or king of exalted rank fails to preserve it, the myriad things will not submit. When the ascending and descending qi of the void converge as one, sweet dew descends, moistening all things without exception. The sage embodies the supreme Dao to respond to all existence, like dew that reaches everywhere—this is how one makes the myriad things submit.

The sage scatters the uncarved block to form vessels and, based on these vessels, establishes names. How could one pursue names and forget the uncarved, chase the branches and lose the root? One must know to return to nature; thus, riding the ten thousand changes, one remains free from peril.

The rivers and seas are where water gathers; the valleys and streams are where water divides. The Dao is the ancestor of the myriad things; the myriad things are the branches of the Dao. All are water. Thus, valleys and streams return to where they gather; all are the Dao. Thus, the myriad things submit to their ancestor.

Lü’s commentary:
The Dao is eternally nameless; to name it as “Dao” is already to depart from it. When it is nameless, it has not yet begun to be a thing. Its uncarved state may be called small, yet the world does not dare subjugate it. Why? Heaven and earth rely on it to begin; the myriad things depend on it to live. Who in the world would dare subjugate that from which they originate or by which they are born? This is called the true ruler. The myriad things all possess a true ruler—this is what is meant.

If lords and kings can preserve it, they thereby use the true ruler to rule the myriad things. Which of the myriad things, possessing their true ruler, would not submit? Thus it is said, “When the sage arises, the myriad things behold.” The utmost yin is solemn; the utmost yang is blazing. Solemnity issues from heaven; blazing radiance emerges from earth. When the two intermingle, harmony is achieved and things are born. The horse serves as their regulator, yet its form is unseen. When heaven and earth unite to descend sweet dew, this is the perfection of their intermingling and harmony. If lords and kings hold to the Dao as their regulator, the myriad things will submit—just so, yet who can see its form? Thus, people are not commanded, yet all is evenly distributed.

The nameless uncarved block is without thought, without action. As soon as the craftsman or steward moves, the system begins, and names come into being. At this time, one must know when to stop, so that what is at peace is easily maintained, what is unformed is easily planned, what is fragile is easily broken, and what is subtle is easily dispersed. Act before there is disorder; govern before there is chaos—then what peril could there be? This is the way for kings and lords to preserve it.

The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams in relation to rivers and seas—is there any that does not return to them?

Xizhai’s commentary:
This speaks of the Dao and vessels circulating in mutual succession, their weight and lightness alternating. The Dao is eternally nameless and cannot be seen, yet even a commoner who attains it—though the uncarved is small—the world does not dare subjugate it, knowing that nothing can be added to its reverence. Though lords and kings are great, if they cannot preserve it, the myriad things will not submit. That which makes them submit lies here, not there.

For example, though heaven and earth differ in height, when they unite to descend sweet dew, nothing is not evenly moistened—this shows that heaven and earth are not truly separate. From this, we see that the Dao, though small, need not be considered light; lords and kings, though great, need not be considered noble; heaven and earth, though divided, need not be considered apart. Though the Dao scatters into things and each thing has its name, heaven has never truly abandoned things. Only because heaven still gives life to them do things stand between heaven and earth without peril. Things do not diminish the Dao by scattering it; the Dao does not disperse by giving life to things.

It is like valleys and streams forming clouds and rain, rivers and seas providing moisture: the qi of valleys and streams is never cut off from rivers and seas, nor is the qi of rivers and seas cut off from valleys and streams. Viewed through the Dao, there is never a day without circulation; viewed through vessels, the divisions of water and land differ. Yet all is one.

*Bisheng*:
The “eternal Dao” refers to the “constant Dao” mentioned in the first chapter.

The "nameless" refers to the "nameless" spoken of in the first chapter. Because it is neither carved nor polished, it is called "uncarved wood"; because it is called "subtle" and "minute," it is called "small." Yet few are those who can perceive the small and abide by it. If lords and kings could abide by this and perceive the small, they would be called "illuminated." To know the child is to guard the mother. Thus, stillness becomes the lord of movement, and movement its minister; the One becomes the host of the myriad, and the myriad its guests. Who then would have a minister coarser than the uncured wood?

In the beginning, the nameless was the origin of heaven and earth. The "maker" carves the uncured wood and divides it. The beginning was originally nameless; once carved, it acquires names. If one pursues names without cease, then one generates two, two generates three, and even the most skillful reckoner cannot calculate the endless proliferation of names and forms, all taken as real and engaged in contention. What could be more disastrous than the calamities of yin and yang? This is what is meant by "not knowing the constant and recklessly acting—misfortune."

If one truly knows that the nameless can accommodate the named, then the named can also return to the nameless. Therefore, value the cessation of cessation, anchoring it in the nameless uncured wood. Knowing when to stop prevents being swept away by things; in tranquil self-sufficiency, peril has no place to arise. This is not forced. Things are born by the Dao and perish by the Dao; all things arise from the Dao, and all things return to the Dao. The nature of the self resides within; I myself restore it—what difficulty is there in this?

Thus, the rivers and seas are the source of water, while valleys and streams are its branches. Though branches differ, they are all contained within the source; though names vary, they are all governed by the Dao.

One who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened.
One who overcomes others has force; one who overcomes oneself is strong.
One who knows contentment is rich; one who strives resolutely has will.
One who does not lose their place endures; one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.
*(Not losing one’s place is what the *Yi* means by "abiding in one’s place." Luojia said: "To live without being bound by life is called endurance; to die without perishing is called longevity.")*

Su’s commentary:
Distinguishing things leads to wisdom, but obscuration is exhausted in illumination. The mind that discriminates is not yet eliminated, so one may know others but not oneself. When obscuration is exhausted, there is no more discrimination, so one can know oneself and extend that knowledge to others. Force may reach others but not oneself; overcoming the self and returning to one’s nature is beyond force, so it may be called strength. One who knows contentment finds sufficiency in whatever they encounter and is never poor. Though one may possess the world, if they constantly harbor a sense of insufficiency, they remain poor all their life. Not contending with things yet ceaselessly striving—nothing can wrest their will from them. Though things change endlessly, the mind never loses its place, so it endures. The changes of life and death are vast, yet one’s nature remains serene and undiminished—this is how the ancients’ highest persons could be neither born nor die.

Lü’s commentary:
One who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened. Only after knowing oneself can one know others, so enlightenment is surely the source of wisdom. One who overcomes others has force; one who overcomes oneself is strong. Only after overcoming oneself can one overcome others, so strength is surely the source of force. Returning to the mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called enlightenment. One who cannot know oneself cannot know constancy, so knowing constancy is the way to know oneself. Enlightenment that reaches self-knowledge—what difficulty would there be in knowing others? Guarding softness is called strength, but contending with things is daily strife of the mind, not guarding softness. Thus, guarding softness is the way to overcome oneself. Strength that reaches self-overcoming—what difficulty would there be in overcoming others? With the enlightenment of self-knowledge, one knows that the myriad things are complete within oneself and has no need to seek outside. Thus, one who knows contentment is rich. With the strength of self-overcoming, one diligently practices the Dao and need not seek elsewhere. Thus, one who strives resolutely has will. Knowing one’s sufficiency and striving resolutely, one can preserve what they preserve and not be swayed by things. Thus, one who does not lose their place endures. Preserving what they preserve, though they die, they have not perished. Thus, one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.

Xi’s commentary:
Knowledge directed outward is wisdom; directed inward, it is enlightenment. Victory directed outward is force; directed inward, it is strength. Wisdom and force are illusory; enlightenment and strength are real. The gateway to the Dao lies here. People fail to enter the Dao because they see themselves dimly and are overcome by things. If one is inwardly enlightened, they will not chase after externals; not chasing externals, they gradually overcome things. With time, they naturally enter the Dao. All discontent arises from not knowing what one possesses. The myriad things are complete within me; turning inward and reflecting, one knows that taking from oneself is sufficient—is this not wealth? Knowing contentment, the mind gradually departs from existence. Though force is not yet complete, if one cannot fulfill their vision, they must have a resolute will to strive. Seeing the root of tranquility, they gradually return to the Dao. In emptiness, they verify reality; what they attain does not shift, transcending past and present, vast and ever-abiding—this is called not losing one’s place. Regarding life and death as morning and evening, living without possession, dying without perishing—this is called longevity.

The Farmer’s commentary:
Liezi’s "not transforming," Zhuangzi’s "not dying," and the Buddha’s "not perishing" all share the same meaning as "dying yet not perishing." Thus, the sage’s life is the same as death—this is called "spirit"; the sage’s death is the same as life—this is called "longevity." This speaks of their life and death being no different. Only because life and death share the same form and the myriad things reside in one storehouse does the body become like the cicada’s shell or the snake’s slough—a temporary dwelling. The cicada’s shell is already dead, yet the cicada has not perished; the snake’s slough has already decayed, yet the snake has not been lost. Why? Because the true does not perish even in death.

It is said: The highest person is not burned by fire, not drowned by water; tigers cannot seize them, rhinoceroses cannot gore them. Riding the void, they do not fall; striking rocks, they are not obstructed. Yet it is also said they "die yet do not perish." Why? The sage merely follows the times. When the times call for action, the sage does not forcibly avoid it; when the times call for cessation, the sage does not forcibly act. They merely observe heaven’s decree. Thus, there are those who can act yet do not, so there are those who live yet do not die, and those who die yet do not perish.

The great Dao flows freely, available to left and right. The myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse. Its work is accomplished, yet it does not claim possession. It nurtures and nourishes the myriad things yet does not act as their master. Always desireless, it may be called "small." The myriad things return to it yet do not know their master—it may be called "great." Thus, the sage never acts as great and thereby accomplishes greatness.
*(Flowing freely means without attachment.)*

Su’s Annotation:
["Flowing freely" means it is neither permissible nor impermissible, thus it reaches everywhere—left and right, above and below, in all directions. Those in the world who give life to things yet do not refuse them will surely claim possession in the name of the self. Those who avoid things and do not possess them will surely refuse things and not give life. Only the Dao gives life without refusal, accomplishes without possession. If one acts as great with a mind to be great, one becomes small.]

Lü’s Annotation:
[It may be left but not right, or right but not left—what adheres to things in a partial manner is not the great Dao. The great Dao is nowhere absent, thus it flows freely and may be left or right. All things that are great cannot be called small, and what is small cannot be called great—this is the Dao. Because it may be left or right, the myriad things rely on it to live yet it does not refuse. It accomplishes success yet does not dwell in it, clothes and nourishes the myriad things yet does not act as their master. Precisely because it does not dwell or act as master, it is always desireless, and in this desirelessness lies its most wondrous quality. Thus, it may be called "small." The myriad things return to it yet do not know their master—this is its utmost capacity. Thus, it may be called "great." Yet if it is already great but may still be called small, it is not truly great. If it is already small but may still be called great, it is not truly small. Neither great nor small, the Dao thus remains hidden in namelessness. Then wherein lies the Dao’s greatness? It does not reside in being great. The sage embodies the Dao, so how could their accomplishment of greatness come from acting as great?]

Xizhai’s Annotation:
[The great Dao flows freely, filling the eight directions. In its application, it is as if present to the left and right. The myriad things do not live without the Dao, yet the Dao never speaks of its ability. The myriad things do not accomplish without the Dao, yet the Dao never names its achievement. The myriad things are not nourished without the Dao, yet the Dao never acts as their master. When it is small, no trace of it is seen; when it is great, it never acts as master over the myriad things, yet all things return to it. The sage is likewise—never acting as great, yet nothing in the world surpasses them. Only by not claiming greatness do they accomplish greatness.]

*Brush Notes*:
[It may be called small, yet one cannot call it small; it may be called great, yet one cannot call it great. Precisely because it may be left or right, it is neither small nor great. Neither small nor great, it thereby accomplishes greatness.]

*Grasping the Great Image*:
[All under heaven come, yet it does no harm; there is peace, tranquility, and ease. Music and bait may stop passing travelers, but the Dao’s words, emerging from the mouth, are bland and without flavor—seen, they are not worth seeing; heard, they are not worth hearing. Yet their use cannot be exhausted.]

[Lin Xiyi says: The "great image" is the image of no-image. "All under heaven come" means grasping this and acting accordingly throughout the world. "Exhausted" means complete.]

*Silent Harmony* Annotation:
[The "great image" is the Dao. Those who can grasp the ancient Dao to govern the present being will see all things under heaven return to them. The sage regards the people as infants, fearing only harm to them—how much more so would they cause harm through action? Never causing harm, those who come and return suffer no injury. Suffering no injury, all under heaven abide in their peace and tranquility. Music pleases the ear, and bait suits the mouth, so travelers linger in delight and satisfaction. Yet these are not their true abode, and they cannot stay long. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: "The bird burns its nest; the traveler first laughs, then wails." Those who grasp the great image are not thus—they do not display desires or pleasures to others. Their words, emerging from the mouth, are bland and without flavor; their teachings, entering the heart, are serene and unadorned. Silent and tranquil, though not enough to be seen or heard, their use is inexhaustible, their draught unending, filling a thousand myriad years without exhaustion.]

Su’s Annotation:
[The Dao is neither being nor non-being, thus it is called the "great image." If it were manifestly formed, it would have similarities and differences—similarities would be loved, differences would be hated. Loved, they come; hated, they leave. This is insufficient to make all under heaven come. With love and hate, there is benefit and harm. When love and hate are exhausted, there is no harm to the myriad things. Thus, those who arrive are all at peace, all tranquil, all at ease. Creating music and setting bait to await visitors—are these not enough to stop passing travelers? Yet when the music ends and the bait is gone, they will leave. As for those who grasp the great image to await all under heaven, how would all under heaven know to love it, let alone hate it? Though it lacks fragrance, flavor, form, color, or sound to please others, its use cannot be exhausted.]

Lü’s Annotation:
[The Dao in all under heaven is like rivers and valleys flowing into the Yangtze and the sea. The myriad things return to it yet do not know their master—this is formlessness. Formlessness—this is the Dao.]

Those who grasp the great image—who would cling to their own ways and refuse to follow? Thus it is said: "Grasp the great image, and all under heaven will come." If one loses the Dao and all under heaven comes, then their coming is but departure, and such coming cannot be without harm. But if one grasps the Dao and all under heaven comes, though they may forget one another in the arts of the Dao, they never truly part. Thus, to come without harm, to be at peace, to be tranquil, to be at ease—peace is the utmost of tranquility, and tranquility is the utmost of ease. Where there is music to delight and bait to tempt, those who stop are but passing travelers. The Dao’s words emerge insipid, utterly flavorless—no bait could tempt them. Look and there is nothing to see; listen and there is nothing to hear—no music could delight them. If this is so, how could its use ever be exhausted? When passing travelers stop, they dwell in a mere travelers’ lodge—nothing meant to last. But when its use cannot be exhausted, the people use it daily without awareness, and from it arises their peace, tranquility, and ease.

Xizhai’s Annotation:
When the Dao descends and takes form, things follow it. The foolish follow and do not return; the wise follow and suffer no harm. Those who follow and do not return have lost the Dao and chase after things. Those who follow and suffer no harm move with the Dao. Having moved with the Dao, they never leave it, and there is nothing that is not at peace, nothing that is not tranquil, nothing that is not at ease. They unite with the Dao in heart, yet do not know the Dao or the heart. If one knows the Dao and acts, there will be unrest, disquiet, and unease. The sage’s relation to forms and vessels is like a passing traveler’s stay in a roadside inn—brief and fleeting, without attachment or regret. If one is lured by desires and pleasures, the traveler lingers where they lodge and does not depart, and there is no trouble they will not bring. Thus, the sage grasps the great image and follows, though they move with things, their heart ever abides with the Dao. They savor the flavorless, see the colorless, hear the soundless, and employ the useless—within forms and vessels, they fully realize the Dao’s use. This is how they attain peace, tranquility, and ease.

"To gather, one must first expand; to weaken, one must first strengthen; to abolish, one must first establish; to take, one must first give." This is called subtle clarity. The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. Fish cannot leave the depths; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.

Su’s Annotation:
To seize without first giving is to fail in force and fall short in principle. If force is insufficient, taking is difficult; if principle is lacking, things will not submit. Yet this verges on the use of cunning, no different from Guan Zhong or Sun Wu. The sage’s traces may resemble the worldly, but the sage rides principle while the worldly employ cunning. Riding principle is like a physician’s skill in treating illness; using cunning is like a merchant’s skill in seeking profit. The sage knows that hardness and strength cannot be relied upon, so they abide in softness and weakness. While the world’s hardness and strength vie and clash, they alone remain soft and weak, waiting. When the great are wounded and the small perish, they sit unmoving and await their end—this is what is called victory. Yet does the sage intentionally act thus to overcome things? They know the natural course of power and dwell in its spontaneity. Fish, though lacking claws and teeth to overcome things, dwell in the depths, and even the strong cannot seize them. But once they leave the depths for land, they are but helpless creatures—what can they do? The sage abides in softness and weakness, and the hard and strong cannot harm them. Not only can they not be harmed, but they will ultimately preserve and control what follows—is this not the state’s sharpest tool? Only when fish leave the depths can others control them. The sage, ever abiding in softness and weakness without weariness, ultimately tames all under heaven—how could this be shared with the common people?

Lü’s Annotation:
"To gather, one must first expand; to weaken, one must first strengthen; to abolish, one must first establish; to take, one must first give"—the Dao of heaven, the principle of things, and the affairs of humans never fail to follow this pattern. From expansion, one knows gathering; from strength, one knows weakness; from establishment, one knows abolition; from giving, one knows taking. Who but the perceptive can grasp this? Thus it is called subtle clarity. Yet those who gather, expand, weaken, strengthen, abolish, establish, take, or give are formless and soft; what they gather, expand, weaken, strengthen, abolish, establish, take, or give are formed and hard. Thus, the soft overcoming the hard is evident. One cannot depart from softness and weakness, just as fish cannot leave the depths. If fish leave the depths, they are caught; if one departs from softness and weakness, they perish. The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest, entering where there is no gap. Galloping through the hardest and entering where there is no gap—this is the sharpness of tools. Wielding sharp tools to govern the state and its people, their strategies and movements always lie in the formless—how could one let others know their source? Thus it is said: "The state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others."

Yuanze’s Annotation:
The nature of yin and yang is like a cycle: when going reaches its limit, it returns; when flourishing reaches its peak, it declines. Observe the waning of the full moon and the decline of the sun at noon, and the unity of all things becomes clear. Only the perfected person deeply comprehends prevention, understanding the traceless. Thus, in nurturing life, they are at ease in bending and stretching; in conducting themselves, they are attuned to growth and decline; in managing affairs, they know the calculations of success and failure; in confronting enemies, they grasp the art of capture and release. The ancients responded to myriad changes with equanimity, free from disturbance, through this Dao. Even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it—how much less can people? The *Book of Changes* says: "The inchworm bends to extend itself; the dragon and snake hibernate to preserve themselves." Seeing form, one knows the hard and strong control the soft and weak; understanding principle, one realizes the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong. The perfected person deeply grasps the meaning of subtle clarity, so they are humble without arrogance, empty without fullness. They do not contend with things, yet nothing can contend with them. Though this Dao originates in words, its transformations are endless—now soft, now hard, now weak, now strong—who can fix them? Yet even when hard and strong, if softness and weakness cannot overcome them, their movement accords with...

Thus, while the heart accords with principle, it never departs from softness and weakness. From this perspective, we again recognize that softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength—this is what is called the "sharp instrument." The fish, by concealing itself in the depths through softness and weakness, preserves its life. The sage retreats into seclusion, wielding ultimate power to turn the myriad things as if by unseen hands. Though their strength moves heaven and earth, the world does not perceive their vigor; though their might subdues the realm, none name them martial. How could they violently overpower spirits and allow the masses to discuss them?

I have privately considered this: what sets the sage apart from others is their mastery of concealment. When one meets things with hardness and strength, the hardness and strength of those things cannot be overcome. The world all relies on hardness and strength to conquer things, yet I alone lodge in the realm of softness, weakness, and non-contention. When I act, who can resist? Observe the Way of Heaven: autumn and winter become spring and summer—this is but one proof. The sage hides in profound obscurity, taking softness and weakness as their outward form. Thus, they guide the myriad things within their art, and no spirit can fathom their actions. Is this not what is called "concealed application and solitary transformation"?

The *Book of Changes* says: "Concealment is the means to exercise power." Zhuangzi says: "The fish has its strategy." The meaning aligns with this.

**Chunfu’s Annotation:**
"About to" is the phrase of impending action; "must certainly" is the phrase of accomplished fact. Creation and transformation have their cycles of growth and decline, fullness and emptiness; human affairs have their principles of fortune and misfortune, interdependence and latent potential. Thus, when things are about to become such, they must have already been so. Though the "about to" has not yet taken form, the "already" is visible. If one can grasp the "already" and inversely perceive the "about to," then even what seems obscure is in truth perfectly clear. Hence it is said: "This is called foresight and clarity." That softness overcomes hardness and weakness overcomes strength is precisely this principle.

Yet while it may be called "subtle clarity," it is permissible for the subtle to be clear, but not for the clear to be subtle. What is "subtle yet clear"? It is concealing this principle to nurture oneself—remaining profoundly still, deeply withdrawn, at ease and self-content, like a fish that never leaves the depths. What is "making the subtle clear"? It is displaying this principle to others, provoking conflict, inviting trouble, aiding bandits and teaching thieves—like showing a sharp weapon to others.

Zhuangzi’s *Chapter on Opening the Satchel* elucidates this meaning. The "sharp instrument" is a weapon; the metaphor speaks of the principle of subtle clarity. When the sage employs it, it becomes the Great Dao; when a villain usurps it, it becomes the art of strategic expansion and contraction, whose harm surpasses that of blades. Thus, the sage compares it to a "sharp instrument."

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
This is the sage’s method of restraining the heart and seizing the passions. The heart, as a thing, moves in and out without fixed time or place. To forcibly stop it is to make it stop all the more. The sage, knowing it cannot be forcibly stopped, seeks to close it by opening it, to weaken it by strengthening it, to abolish it by arousing it, to seize it by yielding to it. Attempting to stop movement by stopping only leads to more stopping; one must instead reverse course and seek stillness through movement. By observing false movement, one exhausts its falsity and abolishes it, returning to the natural and restoring true stillness. Though movement may stir, the stirring heart does not arise; when the heart does not arise, stillness is not born. This is the sage’s way of closing the heart, weakening the will, abolishing passions, and seizing desires—subtle and difficult to perceive. Hence it is said: "This is called foresight and clarity."

This foresight and clarity, being both soft and weak, can overcome the world’s hard and strong desires because it does not depart from the Mother of the Dao. If it departs from the Mother of the Dao, it is like a fish leaving the depths. Just as a fish cannot leave the depths, so too must the state’s sharp instrument not be shown to others. If shown to others, they will not believe it.

Those who interpret this passage in the world often fail to follow its root, mixing in the military strategies of Sun and Wu. This is why the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Rites* were composed to enlighten the ignorant.

】 The Dao is eternally non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Should lords and kings abide by this, the myriad things will transform of themselves. When transformation stirs and desires arise, I shall press them down with the nameless uncarved block. The nameless uncarved block itself will then harbor no desire, and with no desire, the world will settle into stillness and right itself.

The Dao’s constancy lies in its celestial norm. As Jiefu notes: "It speaks of the Dao’s governance, hence ‘the myriad things will naturally submit’; it speaks of the Dao’s transformation, hence ‘the myriad things will naturally transform.’" "Arise" denotes movement; "press down" means to stabilize and render unmoving. Kumarajiva says: "When the heart attains unity and emptiness, its resources are never lost, the ten thousand spirits submit to transformation, and deviance returns to rectitude."

**Hisheng’s Annotation:**
The Dao’s constancy arises from its formless essence, hence its non-action; its function is form-bound, hence its all-accomplishing nature. Should lords and kings preserve this primordial technique of origin and mother, the principles of the myriad things will be realized, and the world will be rectified—this is what is meant by "I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves." If the slightest trace of profit or desire should sprout, one must immediately ground and rectify it with the substance of the great Dao, ensuring no movement takes hold.

The highest virtue practices non-action and does not act for any purpose, thus aligning with the Dao. Lesser virtue acts with purpose, thus aligning with virtue. Those who attain virtue inevitably lose the Dao, for where there is a heart of non-action, there must also be traces of non-action. Later generations, tracing these traces, may forget their root, practicing non-action to the point of action. Thus it is said: "The nameless uncarved block itself will harbor no desire"—this is to induce the forgetting of both heart and trace, advancing into ever deeper mystery.

When both heart and trace are forgotten, and the subtleties of affairs and principles are profoundly guarded, the world will each rectify its nature and destiny, unburdened by the traces of things. The opening chapter takes the constant Dao as essence and constant name as function, culminating in "profound and more profound." This chapter takes non-action as essence and all-accomplishing as function, unifying them through the forgetting of both beginning and end, exhausting essence and function in their entirety.

**Su’s Annotation:**
The Dao’s constancy means it accomplishes all without the intention of acting. The sage transforms things through non-action, and the myriad things, once transformed, begin with non-action and gradually progress to action—like the growth of an infant, where human artifice arises day by day. Thus, the decline of the Three Dynasties saw the transformations of human sentiment grow daily more severe. When desires first stir and those above and below the world all yield to them, the changes become inexpressible. If, at the moment of stirring, one does not act upon them but instead presses them down with the nameless uncarved block, there may yet be hope of halting them.

The sage harbors no念 of restraint within and leaves no trace of the uncarved block without, thus preserving the uncarved block in its entirety and wielding great efficacy. If the desire to preserve the uncarved block still lingers in the heart, one strays far from the truth.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
All things possess names, yet the Dao is eternally nameless—thus, all that is named becomes its guest. Hence it is said, "The myriad things will naturally submit," which is to speak from the perspective of the nameless. Yet this merely grasps non-action; to practice non-action without failing to accomplish all is not to cling even to non-action. Thus, "the myriad things will naturally transform," and the self and the myriad things become nothing but the Dao. Who then knows whether the myriad things are guests or the reason for their submission?

When they first submit, names are established. Once names exist, one must also know restraint—knowing restraint means returning to the nameless uncarved block. When they transform and desires arise, I press them down with the nameless uncarved block, and the nameless uncarved block itself will harbor no desire. If the nameless uncarved block harbors no desire, then not only is there non-action, but even the notion of non-action ceases to exist. The world’s movements are rectified by unity. Should lords and kings guard the Dao to this point, they may be said to "harbor no desire and still the world." Could the world then fail to right itself?

Laozi was a true person, yet he did not disdain to earnestly address lords and kings regarding the world’s affairs. Why? The Dao, when cultivated in the self, is authentic; when extended to the world, it becomes universal. If lords and kings understand and abide by it, then cultivating the world is indeed universal. To not hoard the Dao but desire to share it with the world is benevolence; to desire to share it with the world yet first address lords and kings is righteousness. Yet scholars, seeing his words seemingly reject benevolence and righteousness, claim Laozi denigrates and diminishes them—this is not what I accept.

Alas! They fail to perceive the intent behind his rejection. No wonder they do not accept it.

The Xizhai Annotation states: The Dao emerges from nonbeing into being, beginning with the sprouting of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, and culminating in the full establishment of ritual, music, punishment, and governance. When this culmination fails to return [to its source], transformations become endless, and the Dao is increasingly lost. Thus, the sage, when things are about to flow away, restores them with simplicity to stabilize them. Once stabilized with simplicity, simplicity itself becomes nameless. Though employing nameless simplicity, it should appear as if one does not desire it. If there is even a trace of intent to use simplicity, then it is no longer true simplicity. Without desire, the people will right themselves.

*Laozi Yi*, Volume One

The lower text states:
The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue.
The highest virtue acts without contrivance and without purpose.
The lesser virtue acts with contrivance and with purpose.
The highest benevolence acts without contrivance.
The highest righteousness acts with contrivance.
The highest ritual acts, yet when none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows. Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust and the beginning of chaos. Foresight is the flower of the Dao and the origin of folly. Therefore, the great person dwells in thickness, not thinness; resides in substance, not its blossoms. Thus, they discard that and take this.

Su’s Annotation:
The sage follows the heart’s desires without overstepping the bounds, not by intentionally cultivating virtue, but because virtue naturally suffices. Those below, knowing the value of virtue, strive to preserve it, merely completing themselves—what virtue do they possess? To act without contrivance yet with purpose is still to act. Only acting without contrivance and without purpose can be called nonaction. Those below may not fail in their actions, yet they still act with purpose—not mere empty doing but with method. Benevolence and righteousness cannot escape acting, yet what distinguishes them is that benevolence excels in acting without purpose, while righteousness achieves its ends through purposeful action. Virtue has higher and lower, but benevolence and righteousness have only higher forms—why? The lesser virtue lies between benevolence and righteousness, while what is below righteousness is not worth discussing. From virtue descending to ritual, the means by which the sage governs the people reach their limit. If one acts and none respond, they resort to force; if force fails, punishments and warfare arise—mere empty doing without method. Loyalty and trust without ritual remain unseen; when ritual is established, the beauty of loyalty and trust shines outwardly. Between ruler and minister, father and child, husband and wife, friends—externally splendid, yet internally hollow. Thus, following it brings order; opposing it brings chaos. The difference between order and chaos is finer than a hair’s breadth, hence it is called the beginning of chaos. The sage’s profound observation of the myriad things discerns right and wrong, all laid bare before them, like a mirror reflecting forms without omission—what is earlier or later? Common people’s vision is limited to the eye, hearing to the ear, thought to the heart, and conduct among the ten thousand things. They exhaust their intellect to seek knowledge and occasionally glimpse something, mistaking it for clarity while remaining fundamentally foolish from the start. The world’s petty people delight in their small gains below while forgetting what is above, favoring thinness over thickness, plucking blossoms while discarding substance. Who but the great person can discard that and take this?

Lü’s Annotation:
If the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao, how can the mediocre grasp and possess it? The highest virtue takes non-possession as possession; only through non-possession does one truly possess. Thus, it is said: the highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue. The lesser virtue takes non-loss as possession; only by not losing does one possess, yet it is not true virtue. Thus, it is said: the lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue. The highest virtue acts without contrivance, not deliberately acting without purpose but naturally without contrivance. The lesser virtue, not understanding this, acts and thus cannot avoid purpose. Virtue without purpose suffices; yet if there is benevolence, it is still acting. However, the highest benevolence does not engage in benevolence but embodies it—acting without purpose. Benevolence cannot stand alone; it must be paired with righteousness. Even the highest righteousness cannot avoid acting—acting with purpose. Benevolence is merely bestowing, while righteousness selects the proper recipient, not yet demanding reciprocity. Ritual, however, involves reciprocity: not responding to a gesture is improper, just as responding without a prior gesture is improper. The principle of ritual is thus. The highest ritual acts, yet when none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and enforces compliance. If even the highest benevolence, ritual, and righteousness are thus, their lower forms are self-evident. From this, we see that when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows—was this said in vain? Ritual’s mutual demands lead to the thinning of loyalty and trust, the rise of chaos, and the use of cunning. Thus, ritual, though meant to govern chaos, becomes its very origin. Foresight, though meant to employ wisdom, becomes the beginning of folly. Why? People’s governance often arises from thickness; thickness preserves their nature, while thinness fosters artifice. To depart from nature and fabricate is to invite chaos. People’s self-awareness often lies in brightness; brightness reveals substance, while blossoms detach from substance. To abandon substance and pursue blossoms is to invite folly. Therefore, the great person dwells in thickness, not thinness; resides in substance, not its blossoms. Thus, they forget benevolence and righteousness, reject ritual and learning, set aside wisdom, and aspire to the great completeness of the Dao—this is what is meant by discarding that and taking this.

The Xizhai Annotation states: The highest virtue does not act as virtue, thus it resides in benevolence, yet benevolence resides in righteousness, and righteousness follows its course without fixation. The lesser virtue does not lose virtue, thus benevolence cannot be acted upon, righteousness cannot be acted upon as ritual—once acted upon, it cannot be altered. The highest virtue does not lose the Dao; the Dao is constantly nonaction, and the mind of nonaction is absent. The lesser virtue does not lose virtue; virtue involves action, and the traces of action remain.

The highest virtue is nonaction, and this is benevolence. Benevolence is close to the Dao, thus it is said: "Benevolence is humanity," and when combined, it is the Dao. Since benevolence is close to the Dao, it is also nonaction and nonaction-in-action. Descending further, it becomes righteousness—righteousness is appropriateness. To act appropriately toward things is to act with purpose; acting without losing appropriateness is acting without having lost it. Descending further, it becomes ritual—ritual is principle. To govern things with ritual, if none respond and one insists on governing them, there will be those who roll up their sleeves and resist. That which cannot be spoken of as attainable is called the Dao; that which can be spoken of as attainable is called virtue. Virtue in humanity is called benevolence; benevolence that does not lose its appropriateness is called righteousness; righteousness that rectifies things is called ritual. Thus, losing the Dao leads to losing virtue; losing virtue leads to losing benevolence; losing benevolence leads to losing righteousness; losing righteousness leads to losing ritual—this is the natural order of descent. From the Dao, five descents bring us to ritual; beyond these five descents, there is nothing worth observing. Ritual arises from chaos, for where there are elders and juniors, without ritual there is chaos, so ritual is established to remedy it. Yet when one rolls up their sleeves and resists, ritual too is lost. Thus, ritual is the beginning of chaos.

Much knowledge is insufficient to embody the Dao, for excessive knowledge confounds and disrupts one’s original true knowing. Knowledge that does not arise from truth is superficial and lacks substance; thus, much knowledge is the beginning of foolishness. Therefore, ritual is the attenuation of loyalty and trust, and knowledge is the blossom of understanding the Dao. The sage dwells in thickness, not thinness, values substance, not blossoms, and thus never loses the root of the Dao.

Hongfu’s Annotation: Nonaction—and yet also no nonaction.

This is called "supreme virtue"—the Yellow Emperor exemplifies it. Next is one who acts yet in reality does not act; this is called "supreme benevolence"—Yao’s benevolence, vast as heaven, exemplifies it. Further next is one who not only acts but also harbors the intent that action must be taken; this is "supreme righteousness"—the sages from Shun and Yu downward exemplify it. When the Dao is lost, virtue is lost; when virtue is lost, benevolence is lost; when benevolence is lost, righteousness is lost; when righteousness is lost, only then does ritual arise—thus, the means by which one acts reach their extremity.

Therefore, when action elicits no response, one resorts to rolling up their sleeves; when even that elicits no response, punishments, armor, and weapons inevitably follow in succession. This is the beginning of chaos and the attenuation of loyalty and trust. All these arise from placing knowledge and cleverness before the Dao, not recognizing virtue, benevolence, righteousness, or ritual. These are but the blossoms of the Dao and the beginning of the foolishness of the common people—those with true wisdom do not dwell in them. For blossoms are insubstantial, while substance is thick; how can a true person of greatness not know to dwell in thickness?

Those who wish to dwell in thickness must abandon the pursuit of knowledge and cleverness; only then can nonaction and the great Dao be approached.

Yan Junping’s Exegesis:
Emptiness, nonbeing, and nonaction that open and guide the myriad things—this is called the Dao.
A person’s clarity and stillness, responding without being confined to any particular action—this is called virtue.
A person’s universal love for the myriad things, bestowing boundlessly—this is called benevolence.
A person’s ordering of names, rectifying reality, and handling affairs appropriately—this is called righteousness.
A person’s humility, deference, reverence, and harmony in maintaining order—this is called ritual.
These five are all but the vestiges of the Dao, not the ultimate attainment. The ultimate attainment transcends even oneness—how could there be five? Thus, the root of emperors and kings lies in the Dao as their origin and virtue as their beginning. When the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows; when ritual is lost, chaos follows. These five are the Dao embodied as one, yet the duration of a ruler’s reign depends on them.

Thus, what they do is not what they desire; what they seek is not what they attain. They do not devote themselves to the natural but instead to the petty and thin. Ritual as an affair is contradictory within and without; its blossoms flourish while its substance wanes, its branches thrive while its root declines. Ritual is thinner than loyalty, lighter than authority, weaker than trust, inferior to righteousness, and does not reach the level of virtue or benevolence. It is the dregs of governance and the origin of chaos, the source of deceit and pretense, the cause of resentment and conflict. Thus, Zhuangzi said: "The sage practices the teaching without words. The Dao cannot be attained; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence can be practiced; righteousness can be diminished; ritual is mutual pretense." This is what he meant.

Han Fei’s Explanation:
"Benevolence" refers to the heart’s spontaneous delight in loving others, its joy in others’ good fortune and aversion to their misfortune—an impulse the mind cannot suppress, not pursued for recompense. Thus it is said: "The highest benevolence acts without purpose."

"Righteousness" denotes the proper order between ruler and minister, superior and inferior; the distinctions between father and son, noble and base; the conduct between acquaintances and friends; the boundaries of closeness and distance, inner and outer. A minister serves his lord fittingly when the inferior embraces the superior; a son serves his father fittingly when the base honors the noble; acquaintances and friends fittingly assist one another; the close are fittingly within, the distant without. "Righteousness" means acting as is fitting. Since it is fitting, one acts accordingly. Thus it is said: "The highest righteousness acts with purpose."

"Ritual" is the means by which inner feelings are expressed outwardly, the patterned ornament of collective righteousness, the interaction between ruler and minister, father and son, the distinction between noble and base, worthy and unworthy. When the heart harbors feelings that remain unexpressed, one hastens with hurried steps and humble bows to make them clear. When genuine love is not perceived, one employs fine words and elaborate phrases to affirm it. Ritual is the external adornment that clarifies the internal. Thus it is said: "Ritual is the outward expression of inner feeling."

In all things, when people are moved by external objects, they do not recognize the ritual that pertains to themselves. The multitude practices ritual to honor others, and thus their enthusiasm waxes and wanes. The noble person practices ritual for the sake of his own person, and thus the spirit regards it as the highest ritual. The highest ritual is spiritual, but the multitude is divided in purpose and cannot respond in kind. Thus it is said: "The highest ritual is acted, yet none respond." Though the multitude is divided, the sage restores reverence and exhausts the rites of hand and foot without decline. Thus it is said: "One rolls up one’s sleeves and persists in it."

Ritual is the outward expression of inner feeling; ornament is the embellishment of substance. The noble person embraces feeling and discards outward form, favors substance and dislikes adornment. Those who rely on outward form to assess feeling reveal their own foul feelings; those who require adornment to judge substance reveal their own weak substance. How can this be demonstrated? The jade of He Shi is not adorned with five colors; the pearl of Duke Sui is not embellished with silver or gold. Their substance is supremely beautiful, and no object suffices to adorn them. Objects that require adornment to be esteemed possess an inherently unbeautiful substance.

Thus, between father and son, though ritual is fully observed, it remains unclear. Thus it is said: "Ritual is thin." All things cannot flourish simultaneously—this is the case with yin and yang; principle seizes and bestows—this is the case with authority and virtue; where substance is thick, outward form is thin—this is the case with the ritual between father and son. From this perspective, the more elaborate the ritual, the more the sincere heart declines.

Thus, those who practice ritual seek to communicate the unadorned heart of others. The multitude practices ritual: if others respond, they rejoice lightly; if others do not respond, they resent and blame. Now, those who practice ritual seek to communicate the unadorned heart of others while relying on distinctions that invite reproach—how can there be no conflict? Where there is conflict, there is chaos. Thus it is said: "Ritual is the thinness of loyalty and trust, and the origin of chaos."

*Brush Notes*:
The origin of chaos begins with folly; this is an extreme statement on the pernicious effects of ritual and cunning. Zhuangzi cited these words of Laozi and discussed them, saying: "Now that one has become a thing, to return to the root—is it not difficult? Yet it is easy for the great person. Nevertheless, having returned to the root, what is a thing and what is not a thing?" Thus he further said: "What cannot but be concealed is affairs; what cannot but be distant is righteousness; what cannot but be broadened is benevolence; what cannot but be accumulated is ritual; what cannot but be exalted is virtue; what cannot but be made easy is the Dao. Though these several matters differ in rank and sequence, when the sage employs them, they are all the Dao. For the sage, a hundred concerns converge in a single return, and both boundaries dissolve—how could there be any distinction of this and that, any rejection or selection?"

*Attaining the One*:
Heaven attains the One and thereby becomes clear; earth attains the One and thereby becomes stable; spirits attain the One and thereby become numinous; valleys attain the One and thereby become full; the myriad things attain the One and thereby come to life; lords and kings attain the One and thereby become the standard for the world. The essence of their attainment is the same.

If heaven were not clear, it would fear splitting; if earth were not stable, it would fear erupting; if spirits were not numinous, they would fear vanishing; if valleys were not full, they would fear drying up; if the myriad things were not alive, they would fear perishing; if lords and kings were not the standard and exalted in nobility, they would fear stumbling.

Thus, nobility takes humility as its root, and height takes lowliness as its foundation. Therefore, lords and kings refer to themselves as "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy." Is this not taking humility as their root? Is it not so? Thus, to attain the utmost in chariots is to have no chariots. One does not desire to be like jade, lustrous and fine, or like stone, coarse and rough.

Su’s Commentary:
The One is the Dao. All things that become things do so through the Dao. The people of the world see things and forget the Dao. Heaven knows only its clarity, earth only its stability, spirits only their numinosity, valleys only their fullness, the myriad things only their life, and lords and kings only their role as the world’s standard. They do not know that what enables them to attain these is the presence of the Dao.

"Attaining" means reaching the utmost.

Heaven, without the One, would not suddenly split; earth, without the One, would not suddenly burst forth; spirits, without the One, would not suddenly vanish; the myriad things, without the One, would not suddenly perish; and lords and kings, without the One, would not suddenly fall. Yet their ultimate end must reach this point.

The greatness of heaven and earth and the loftiness of lords and kings all arise from the attainment of the One. But what, after all, is this One? It cannot be seen when looked for, nor grasped when sought—it is the most subtle of heaven and earth. This is what is called "base and lowly," the root. Thus, when lords and kings refer to themselves as "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy," they are merely elevating the root and disregarding the branches.

The wheel’s rim, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, yoke, hub, and linchpin come together to form a chariot. Each part can be counted, yet the chariot itself cannot be counted—only then do we realize that "nothingness" is what makes the chariot. This is what is meant by "using the absence of things as their function."

Are heaven and earth then made by calling heaven "heaven" and earth "earth"? Are lords and kings made by calling nobility "nobility"? Within the great and the lofty, the One resides. This is what makes them heaven and earth, lords and kings, yet no one knows it.

Thus, the One dwells in the noble yet is not noble; it dwells in the base yet is not base—unlike jade, which is lustrous and fine yet cannot be base, or stone, which is coarse and rough yet cannot be noble.

Lü’s Commentary:
The Dao is merely the One. Those who attain it make it separate from the Dao, no longer one. Only by attaining it without attachment is it called "attaining the One." All things that attain the One are no different.

Look up, and it is heaven—attaining the One with clarity, it covers all without collapsing. Look down, and it is earth—attaining the One with stability, it bears all without sinking. Spirits, formless and utterly still, attain the One and thus become wondrously responsive. Valleys, formed yet utterly empty, attain the One and thus respond to all that fills them. The myriad things, in their multitude, attain the One and thus live without end. Lords and kings, in their loftiness, attain the One and thus govern the world’s movements as its standard.

Thus, the One cannot but be attained. For this reason, the One is what enables heaven’s clarity, earth’s stability, spirits’ numinosity, valleys’ fullness, the myriad things’ life, and lords and kings’ role as the world’s standard. If heaven had no clarity, it would split; if earth had no stability, it would burst; if spirits had no numinosity, they would vanish; if valleys had no fullness, they would dry up; if the myriad things had no life, they would perish; and if lords and kings had no standard, would they not fall, knowing only lofty nobility?

Therefore, nobility takes humility as its root—without the base, there would be no nobility to stand upon. Loftiness takes lowliness as its foundation—without the low, there would be no height to rise from. Thus, when the noble is without its nobility and the lofty without its loftiness, is this not how lords and kings serve as the world’s standard without falling?

This is why they call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—titles despised by others as base—yet use them as their noble and lofty designations, for their root lies therein. Thus, when one pursues multiplicity to its utmost and reaches the One, nobility becomes no different from baseness, and lowliness no longer separates from loftiness. Praise arises from the absence of praise; when praise is no praise, blame is no blame. When praise is no praise, it cannot be made noble; when blame is no blame, it cannot be made base. Jade can be made noble by polishing it, and stone can be made base by its coarseness—yet one does not desire to be lustrous like jade or rough like stone, for such things cannot be made noble or base.

Xizhai’s Commentary:
Confucius said, "My Way is threaded through with a single One." What is this One?

Xizhai’s Commentary:
Heaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility, the spirit’s numinosity, the valley’s fullness, the myriad things’ vitality, and the lords and kings’ steadfastness—when one pursues these to their utmost, there is nothing that does not become the same. To know why Heaven is clear is to know why Earth is tranquil; to know why the spirit is numinous is to know why the valley is full; to know why the myriad things are vital is to know why lords and kings are steadfast. The *Yi* says: "The world’s paths diverge yet converge as one; its thoughts are many yet reach the same end." What thought, what deliberation is there? It speaks of that which has never not been one.

If one does not know the One, one must set oneself apart. Setting oneself apart, one severs from things. Lords and kings sever from things, and things in turn sever from them. Thus, nobility takes lowliness as its root, and loftiness takes lowness as its foundation. Lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—is this not knowing that nobility takes lowliness as its root? The hub, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, yoke, and nave assemble to form a chariot. Each part has its name, yet the chariot cannot be named. Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom combine to form the Dao. Benevolence and righteousness can be named, yet the Dao cannot be named. Rewards, punishments, penalties, and governance combine to form order. Rewards and punishments can be named, yet order cannot be named. If there is something to grasp, such that its traces appear externally, then the noble—like jade—and the base—like stone—can both be pointed to and named, and people thus begin to distinguish between noble and base.

Hongfu’s Commentary:
Lords and kings, not knowing the Way of attaining the One, are no different from commoners, yet they cannot avoid exalting themselves as noble. Those who exalt themselves will stumble, for they undermine their foundation; those who esteem themselves as noble will stumble, for they reject their root. Why? The principle of attaining the One is neither lowly in commoners nor lofty in lords and kings. In commoners, one may speak of nobility; in lords and kings, one may speak of lowliness—it is only that they do not know this. Now, the wheel, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, yoke, hub, and linchpin assemble to form a chariot. People see these many parts—when has there ever been a chariot? Yet they name it "chariot" and do not call it "wheel, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, yoke, hub, and linchpin." From this, one may understand what is meant by high and low, noble and base. People see that there is noble and base, high and low, yet do not know that these attain the One. When has there ever been high and low, noble and base? Those who exalt themselves cannot be lowly; those who esteem themselves as noble cannot be base. If they cling to what they see and cannot attain the One, then they are merely lustrous like jade or rough like stone.

"Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao. The myriad things in the world are born of being; being is born of non-being."

Xu Qi’s Note:
"Reversion" means that when movement reaches its extreme, it must return—this is its reversion. It is precisely because of movement that there is reversion.

Su’s Commentary:
When one restores their nature, they become still. Yet in their quiescence, they do not move, and when stimulated, they penetrate all things under Heaven—this is the origin of movement. The Dao is formless and soundless. Nothing in the world is weaker than the Dao, yet nothing in the world is stronger than it. This is how it can function through the myriad things. The world does not know that stillness is movement or that weakness is strength, so it is told of the origin of things: all things under Heaven hear of the mother controlling the child; none have heard of the child controlling the mother.

Jiefu’s Explanation:
The function of the Dao lies in weakness, which is nothing but emptiness. Observing it in Heaven: the wind that surpasses me, the wind that yields to me—both prevail over me. Its movement through the great void may be called weak, yet there is no thing it does not stir, no form it does not sway. Thus, the wind’s function lies in weakness. Observing it on Earth: if you breach it to the east, it flows east; if you breach it to the west, it flows west. Water, entrusting itself to the deep abyss, may be called weak, yet it dwells where others despise and attacks the firm and strong—none can surpass it. Thus, water’s function lies in weakness.

It also says: reversion is not the same as movement, yet there is what may be called movement—movement through reversion. Weakness is not the same as strength, yet there is what may be called strength—for weakness is what enables strength. Though it speaks of reversion without mentioning stillness, and of weakness without mentioning strength, when it speaks of movement, one knows that reversion is stillness; when it speaks of weakness, one knows that function is strength. The myriad things are born of being; being is born of non-being—it is like this.

Lü’s Commentary:
The Dao circulates through the myriad things, not that it does not pass away, but its movement always lies in reversion—this is what is meant by "the pivot beginning to grasp the center of the ring to respond endlessly." Its movement through Heaven and Earth is not that it is not strong, but its function always lies in weakness—this is what is meant by "the world’s softest galloping through the world’s hardest, entering where there are no gaps." Thus, the myriad things are born of being; being is born of non-being. Only being can generate the world’s things, yet non-being can generate the world’s being. From this, one knows that the Dao’s movement lies in reversion and its function lies in weakness. If one wishes to revert and be weak, there is nothing but to attain the One and pursue it to the utmost of non-being.

Zhao Zhijian’s Commentary:
"Reversion" means returning to the root. Ordinary people take change and novelty as movement, but those who follow the Dao abandon the branches and return to the root—thus it is said, "the movement of the Dao." It is like the body at ease and the mind at rest, not moving. Abandoning being to return to non-being is called movement—just as distance is called "returning" when one has not gone far, for the name of distance arises from non-being. Now, one has also not come near, yet it is called "returning," for the name arises from the body’s presence. The Dao has no coming or going, yet it has the name of "distance" and "return." The mind is originally at peace, yet it has the meaning of "reversion" and "movement." Those whose inner minds are empty and still, and whose outer conduct is soft and weak, practice the conduct of returning to the root—thus it is said, "weakness is the function of the Dao." Being is qi; though things are not yet formed, this qi already exists—thus it is said, "being." Heaven, Earth, and the myriad dharmas are born from the one qi—thus it is said, "born of being." Non-being is the Dao; the one qi is born from the Dao—thus it is said, "born of non-being." Tracing the source of generation to its utmost points to the Dao as the extreme. It desires scholars to return their minds to what precedes this.

Xizhai’s Commentary:
The world’s myriad things are born and become being; only by returning from being to non-being do they become the Dao. Thus it is said, "reversion is the movement of the Dao." The world’s being must be strong; returning from strength to weakness allows one to gradually seek the Dao. Thus it is said, "weakness is the function of the Dao."

*Bisheng*:
The world’s things are born of being—this is what is meant by "the named, the mother of the myriad things." Being is born of non-being—this is what is meant by "the nameless, the beginning of Heaven and Earth." Non-being must give birth to being, so it esteems reversion. Reversion is returning to non-being. Being is born of non-being, so it esteems weakness. Weakness is the semblance of non-being.

The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it; the middling person hears the Dao and treats it as if it exists and yet does not; the inferior person hears the Dao and laughs greatly at it. If it is not laughed at, it would not suffice to be the Dao. Thus the established saying has it:

The luminous Dao seems obscure;
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreating;
The level Dao seems uneven;
Supreme virtue resembles a valley;
Great whiteness seems sullied;
Abundant virtue seems insufficient;
Established virtue seems indolent;
True essence seems altered;
The great square has no corners;
The great vessel is late in completion;
The great tone has scarce sound;
The great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.

Only the Dao is good at bestowing and yet accomplishing.

*Annotations:*
建立: to establish. 偷: indolent, negligent. 渝: *yú* (羊朱反), to change, alter. *Zhuan Yi* 音义 states that the ancient text reads *shū* (输). *Guangya* says *shū* means foolish; some write it as *yú* (揄), and Dong Yu writes it as *yáo* (揺). Here, following Wang Bi and Fu Yi, it is written as *yú* (渝). 贷: to lend temporarily, not to give permanently; Zhao Zhijian says, "To *dài* is to borrow briefly, not to bestow forever." 且: provisional, not enduring. It is desired that those who receive the loan do not remain long, and those who attain completion do not abide permanently, so that they may swiftly return to the Dao.

*Commentary on "Scarce Sound":*
The *Yijing* says, "That which is above form is called the Dao"—the Dao pervades beyond form. "That which is below form is called the vessel"—the vessel is confined within form. The superior person knows the subtle and the manifest, pervades beyond form, and thus hears the Dao and believes it, then diligently practices it. The middling person stands at the threshold of the subtle and the manifest, between Dao and vessel, and thus hears the Dao with doubt and half-belief, treating it as if it exists and yet does not. The inferior person knows the manifest but not the subtle, is confined within form, and thus hears the Dao and laughs greatly at it—not only laughing but also rejecting it.

Now, the Dao is subtle, wondrous, profound, and unfathomable. If it were not rejected and laughed at by the inferior person, it would not suffice to be the Dao. Those who embody the Dao unite with the sun and moon in their steadfast brightness, yet their light does not dazzle—this is why the luminous Dao seems obscure. They unite with Heaven and Earth in their simplicity and ease, yet their function cannot be reduced to fixed patterns—this is why the level Dao seems uneven. They unite with the four seasons in their cyclical movement, yet their activity must return to the profound and wondrous—this is why advancing in the Dao seems like retreating. They constantly dwell in lowliness and cannot be altered—this is why supreme virtue resembles a valley. They constantly reside in turbidity and cannot be stained—this is why great whiteness seems sullied. They clothe and shelter all under Heaven yet do not claim their benevolence—this is why abundant virtue seems insufficient. They give life to and nurture the myriad things yet do not display their merit—this is why established virtue seems indolent. They restore their nature to govern their emotions—this is why true essence seems altered. They rectify the internal and act in accordance with...

The external aligns with the great square that has no corners. Like a clumsy artisan who shapes the world through pottery yet does not seek immediate results—this is why the great vessel is slow to complete. Through wordless teaching, they move and inspire the myriad things without resorting to petty speech—this is why the great sound is faint. In acting without action, none perceive their function—this is why the great image has no form. In doing without doing, none recognize their essence—this is why the Dao is hidden and nameless. Only those who skillfully aid and lend to the myriad things without demanding repayment—thus do the myriad things receive their life and completion yet do not know this virtue. Therefore, when lesser scholars hear of this Dao, they laugh at it, not believing it could be so.

Su's Annotation:
The Dao has no form and cannot be seen; it has no sound and cannot be heard. Without first knowing the vastness of the myriad things, unbounded and unobstructed, one’s vision remains clouded, and even with insight, disbelief may persist. Thus, when lesser scholars hear of the Dao, they deem it empty, absurd, and fanciful, and laugh at it. Middling scholars hear of the Dao and waver with it—appearing and disappearing, advancing and retreating—ever doubtful. Only those who see it clearly and completely then practice it diligently, serving it without weariness. Confucius said, *"To speak to him without his growing weary—was it not Yan Hui?"* This is what is meant by the superior scholar.

To establish and set forth: The ancients who expounded teachings held such views, and Laozi adopted them in what follows. It illuminates all without being investigative. Though it does not act, none in the world can surpass its swiftness. Whether leveling or filling, wherever it reaches becomes even, yet it never erodes. Supreme virtue does not assert virtue, like a valley’s emptiness. The purest white appears tainted—this describes the scholar who scorns impurity, not the sage. Vast virtue seems insufficient, for when it is boundless and cannot be further augmented, it simply remains thus, not truly vast. Established virtue appears negligent, for it follows the natural course of things without imposing itself—outwardly seeming indolent, yet inwardly firm. True substance appears mutable, for the sage embraces the spirit, adapting to change without losing constancy—outwardly seeming altered. The great square has no corners, preserving its fullness without sharp edges. The great vessel is slow to complete, for its magnitude precludes immediate use. The great sound is beyond hearing, not something the ear can grasp. The great image has no form, not something the eye can perceive. The Dao resides in all these, manifesting everywhere. These twelve examples reveal the Dao in concrete affairs, yet the Dao in its totality remains hidden in namelessness. Only by dwelling in it can one extend its abundance to supply what is lacking, so that all things depend on it to reach completion.

Lü’s Annotation:
Confucius said, *"To hear the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening without regret."* Thus, for one who has heard the Dao, life and death cannot burden the mind—how could mere knowledge suffice? The superior scholar truly hears the Dao. Having truly heard it, doubt vanishes, and only diligent practice remains. But what does diligent practice entail? It means observing within the heart to align with what has been heard. The middling scholar hears the Dao but does not fully grasp it, wavering between presence and absence. Such uncertainty prevents steadfast practice, leading only to sporadic effort.

The lesser scholar hears the Dao but does not believe in it. Thus, he laughs greatly at it. The reason for his great laughter is that he seeks it through human emotions and fails to attain it. If the Dao could be sought through emotions, he would not laugh at it. Therefore, it is said: *"If it were not laughed at, it would not suffice to be the Dao."* Those who established teachings in ancient times all declared that the Dao cannot be sought through emotions. Only in profound obscurity does one alone perceive clarity; only in utter silence does one alone hear harmony. This is called *"illuminating the Dao."*

If one obscures harmony with right and wrong and rests in it, then in the celestial balance, nothing is not so, and nothing is not right. This is called *"the level Dao."* If one acts for the Dao by daily diminishing, diminishing further until reaching non-action, this is called *"advancing the Dao as if retreating."*

The highest virtue is non-action without contrivance. Yet its responses are like echoes—is this not like a valley? The purest white is cleansed and examined without blemish. Yet it bears the world’s filth—is this not like disgrace? The most expansive virtue is vast, containing all without limit, yet it never displays itself, never asserts itself, never boasts, never exalts itself—is this not like insufficiency?

One who excels in establishing virtue cannot be uprooted, for it is established in the constant of non-being, and thus appears steadfastly present. Therefore, it is said: *"Establishing virtue seems negligent."* Holding to one’s nature and embracing the spirit, one wanders among worldly customs without being startled. Therefore, it is said: *"Authenticity seems mutable."*

The great square has no corners. Its vastness dissolves the four directions into the unfathomable, without east or west, beginning in profound obscurity and returning to great penetration—this is the cornerless vastness of the great square. Great accomplishment seems deficient. Daily reckoning finds it insufficient, yet yearly reckoning finds it abundant—this is the late completion of the great vessel.

The great sound is inaudible when listened to, hence it is called *"rare sound."* The great image is invisible when looked upon, hence it is called *"formless."* All these are the Dao. Yet it is called *"illuminated yet seeming obscure,"* *"level yet seeming uneven,"* *"advancing yet seeming retreating,"* even to the point where sound is rare and image is formless—name and reality constantly appear opposite.

Only the Dao is capable of this. Thus, when one uses it to benefit others, one’s own abundance increases; when one gives it to others, one’s own wealth multiplies. To give life, to nurture, to grow, to cultivate, to mature, to ripen, to nourish, to shelter—none of these are apart from the Dao. Therefore, it is said: *"Only the Dao excels in bestowing and completing."*

Yuanze’s Annotation:
I have privately discussed this chapter, saying that the Dao is not distant from people, yet the world cannot perceive it because they lack illumination. Thus, it begins with *"illuminating the Dao."* The great Dao is utterly level, yet only the illuminated can follow it, so next it speaks of *"the level Dao."* Advancing in the Dao, one returns to the constancy of nature and destiny—this is the virtue of non-virtue. Thus, it next speaks of *"the highest virtue."*

The highest virtue is self-attained and differs from the myriad things. Thus, it is unstained and white. Because its whiteness naturally distinguishes it from things, how can it be like a valley? Therefore, it next speaks of *"seeming disgrace."* If one is not disgraced yet remains pure, this is the narrowness of Boyi. How can it be expansive? Thus, only after *"seeming disgrace"* does it speak of *"expansive virtue."*

With the highest virtue and expansiveness, one can walk with others yet serve as their lord and teacher. Therefore, it says: *"Establishing virtue seems negligent."* Negligence means not being anxious. There are those who establish virtue, yet in establishing it, they depart from the root and approach falsity. Thus, the essential point lies in not altering one’s true nature. Therefore, it next speaks of *"authenticity seeming mutable."*

By this sequence, the embodiment of the Dao within oneself is complete. Therefore, it says: *"The great square has no corners."* With the great square as one’s body, one can respond to the boundless transformations and extend one’s influence to others. Therefore, it says: *"The great vessel."*

The great vessel is achievement. The perfected person treats chaff and dregs as vessels, yet the vessel is never not great. When Confucius deemed Guan Zhong a *"small vessel,"* was not the achievement of emperors and kings the great vessel? Though the Dao acts in this way, its essence is that it never acts, never possesses.

---

Thus it says: *"The great tone,"* *"the great image."* Yet having exhausted all this, one can unite with the Dao and fulfill the needs of the myriad things, completing their natures.

Alas, this Dao—how can it be known by knowledge, let alone expressed in words? Yet what I have discussed here is but its rough outline.

**Xizhai’s Commentary:**
The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, though the multitude may mock and deride, cannot be made to cease their diligence. The middling person, upon hearing the Dao, though they may not lack belief, cannot be made to cast off doubt. The inferior person, upon hearing the Dao, even if a sage were to rise again, could not be made to refrain from laughter. For those fixated on being are everywhere under heaven. They take being as real, and now they are told that being is not real while non-being is true—who would not doubt and laugh? Thus, that they do not laugh is insufficient to prove the Dao; it is but the natural principle of things and not cause for surprise.

The diligence of the superior person is not diligence by effort but diligence born of insight. The laughter of the inferior person is not laughter by choice but laughter born of blindness. Those who neither rise to diligence nor sink to laughter cannot avoid seeing yet cannot fully trust what they see; even if one wished them not to doubt, it could not be achieved.

Of old, those who established teachings were thus: One who illuminates the Dao illuminates it from within, not through the brightness of form, so that externally nothing of its illumination may be seen. Thus it says: *"Its brightness seems dim."* One who advances in the Dao advances of itself, not through force, so that externally nothing of its advance may be known. Thus it says: *"Its advance seems retreat."* The Dao of the level makes nothing uneven; what others deem level is but their own leveling. Thus it says: *"It seems uneven."* The supreme virtue contains all; though others may embrace the strange and bizarre, one regards them with unity. Thus it says: *"It seems like a valley."* Great whiteness does not stain its nature; if the nature remains unstained, harmonizing with dust is possible. Thus it says: *"It seems disgraced."* Broad virtue must perceive the great; if one perceives the great, one cannot be made to cease. Thus it says: *"It seems insufficient."* One who establishes virtue does so by inwardly confirming their nature; with inner nature established, one’s response to things is necessarily simple. Thus it says: *"It seems negligent."* One who embodies authenticity does not pursue externals; not pursuing externals, one goes only where one wills. Thus it says: *"It seems mutable."* The great square has no corners; it cannot be examined by edges. The great vessel is late in completion; its completion cannot be exhausted. The great tone is scarce of sound; it cannot be known by sound. The great image has no form; it cannot be grasped by form or vessel.

The middling and inferior persons, bound by what they see, judge the traces of the Dao as if they were real—real dimness, real retreat, real unevenness, real disgrace, real negligence, real mutability. Those who do not mock and ridicule are few indeed.

For the great Dao is without name, hidden and unseen. When it bestows through partial completion, that is but its smallest aspect, not its reality. The superior person, knowing the Dao is nameless, disregards its partial bestowals and perceives its greatness, and thus cannot be judged by its name. The middling and inferior persons cling to its partial bestowals and completions, using them to judge the whole—this is why the more they judge, the further they stray.

**Bisheng’s Notes:**
The superior person is tranquil, silent, empty, and non-active. Diligence in this is the utmost of diligent practice, yet in truth, there is nothing practiced. This is what is called *"natural release from bondage."* How could the inferior person comprehend it? Junping said: What the middling person hears is not the utmost beauty; what the inferior person sees is not the utmost goodness. What the middling person doubts and the inferior person laughs at—these are the true beauty and goodness.

*"The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things. The myriad things carry yin and embrace yang, blending their qi to attain harmony. What people despise are orphanhood, loneliness, and unworthiness, yet kings and lords take these as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased, or increased yet thereby diminished. What others teach, I also teach: 'The strong and violent do not meet a natural death.' I will take this as the father of teachings."*

**Annotations:**
All moving creatures have their backs turned toward the rear—yin, stillness—and their ears, eyes, mouth, and nose positioned in front—yang, movement. Thus it says *"carry yin and embrace yang."* Plants turn away from cold and toward warmth, with their qi circulating between. Wood cut off from water is called a *liang*; a wooden beam bearing a roof is also called a *liang*, taking its name from its strength. Thus it says *"strong and violent."* The *Inscription of the Golden Man* states: *"The strong and violent do not meet a natural death; the competitive inevitably encounter their match."* The ancients used this as a teaching, and I also teach it. Yet Laozi alone venerates it as the *"father of teachings,"* just as he calls the Dao the *"mother of the myriad things."* The mother governs nurture; the father governs instruction. Thus, when speaking of generation, it is called *"mother";* when speaking of teaching, it is called *"father."*

**Su’s Commentary:**
The Dao is neither one nor two, yet when it pairs with things, the Dao is one while things are not. Thus, the Dao is named *"One,"* yet the Dao is not one. One and one make two; two and one make three. Proceeding thus, the myriad things are born. Though things number in the tens of thousands, none do not carry yin and embrace yang, blending their qi to attain harmony. This is because things are born from the Three, and the Three are born from the One—such is the natural principle. People of the world, not knowing the origin of the myriad things, all despise the small and lowly while prizing the great and noble. Yet kings and lords, in their exalted position, refer to themselves as *"orphan,"* *"lonely,"* and *"unworthy."* The enlightened of antiquity already understood this.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The Dao in the world has nothing to pair with; if something pairs with it, that is but the One. Thus it says *"the Dao gives birth to the One."* Having called it *"One,"* the one who names it and the named become two. Thus it says *"the One gives birth to the Two."* With one and two, there is three. Thus it says *"the Two gives birth to the Three."* If one insists on naming it, it inevitably reaches three, and with three established, the myriad things are born. Thus it says *"the Three gives birth to the myriad things."*

All that is dark and unfathomable is yin; all that is bright and visible is yang. Living things all turn their backs to the dark and unfathomable yin and face the bright and visible yang. *"Carry"* means to turn one’s back; *"embrace"* means to face. Yet there must be the blending qi to harmonize them, for yin and yang are two, while the blending qi is one. The myriad things cannot be born without the one. Thus, what people desire are carriages and caps, wealth and nobility, while what they despise are orphanhood, loneliness, and unworthiness. Yet carriages and caps are not one’s nature or destiny; they are but transient, borrowed things. To possess them as if they were fixed is to face yang without knowing how to return—this is the gravest error. The ancients who established names used what people despise as titles for kings and lords, wishing them to value what is lowly and not forget humility, to hold what is high and not forget descent, to embrace and know what they carry, to face and know what they return to, so as not to lose the proper balance.

Thus, it is solely the harmony of the blending One. Therefore, some things, when diminished, are augmented; when augmented, are diminished. Fullness invites loss; humility receives gain—this is the Dao of Heaven. What others teach, I too teach as my principle; what I teach is the Dao. Teaching without adhering to my principle is merely not the Dao. Only those who penetrate the Dao attain the One. Attaining the One, there is no self; without self, there is no contention. Precisely because there is no contention, none in the world can contend with them. Those who oppose this are but followers of death. Though the teachings of the noble person may vary, they all return to the One and the absence of self—this is the wellspring from which teaching arises. Thus it is said: "The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death; I shall take this as the father of teaching."

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
The Dao generates the One, and as Dao, it is One. Before the One is born, how can there be two? Without two, the One does not scatter, hence it is called "not two," signifying that it has not yet become One. When it becomes One, then there is two; with yang, there is yin; with yin and yang, there arises their interaction. Thus, with two, there is three, and with three, there is nothing that does not exist. The myriad things embrace yang as one, bear yin as two, and through the interaction of yin and yang, the blending qi harmonizes them as three. What thing does not possess these three? Yet, in essence, all must return to the Dao. The Dao is what is called "not yet One." Since its root arises from the Dao, its branches do not lose the Dao. Therefore, some things in the world, when diminished, are augmented; when augmented, are diminished. Orphanhood, loneliness, and unworthiness become titles for kings and lords—this is the augmentation born of diminution. The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death—this is the diminution born of augmentation. Diminution and augmentation share the same source: to diminish oneself is to be augmented; to augment oneself is to be diminished. The sage never augments yet naturally takes orphanhood, loneliness, and unworthiness as titles, wishing to make people understand that the strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death. This is what is meant by "what others teach, I too teach"—it is but a response to the world, unavoidable.

The softest in the world rides and commands the hardest; "nothing" enters where there is no gap. Thus I know the benefit of non-action. The teaching of no-words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world can attain them.

**Su’s Annotation:**
To oppose hardness with hardness is to break or shatter; to oppose hardness with softness leaves the soft unyielding and the hard unharmed. In things, water exemplifies this. To enter the existent with the existent is to meet resistance and incompatibility; to enter the existent with the non-existent is to labor not and remain unperceived. In things, spirit exemplifies this. Thus, the sage, being capable of non-action, can command the strong and move through all existence.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The softest in the world rides and commands the hardest—observed in things, water exemplifies this. "Nothing" enters where there is no gap—observed in things, qi exemplifies this. Water, by its softness and weakness, nearly approaches the Dao, yet cannot be without form. Still, it overcomes hardness where none can surpass it. Qi, by its lack of substance, verges on the numinous, yet cannot be without qi. Still, it enters where there is no gap. How much more so with the formless utmost softness and the unseen qi of the Great Simplicity? To ride and command the hardest in the world and enter where there is no gap—what could not be moved, and where could one not find ease? Thus it is said: "Thus I know the benefit of non-action." Yet the teaching of no-words and the benefit of non-action are rarely attained in the world—this is merely not knowing to return to one’s root.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
Things are not originally things; hardness is an artificial form. Though the hardest in the world, in the end, it must return to nothing. If the softest in the world can already ride and command the hardest, how much more can the true nothingness shatter the artificiality of existence? Thus, "nothing" can enter where there is no gap—this means treading through water and fire, entering metal and stone, yet its essence remains unscathed. The action of non-action is action through the Dao; the teaching of no-words is teaching through Heaven. None can attain these.

Which is dearer, fame or life? Which is weightier, life or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Therefore, excessive love incurs great expense; hoarding invites heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—thus can one endure long.

**Xia’s Annotation:**
"More" means weightier. Xia says: "Knowing contentment delights in what one already has as sufficient, without seeking more." Without seeking, how could there be disgrace? "Knowing when to stop" fears that further advance may bring loss—this is knowing the subtle. Knowing the subtle, how could there be danger?

**Su’s Annotation:**
To place fame after life, to value life and devalue wealth, is still not to forget the self. Those who forget the self do not even possess life, let alone fame or wealth. Yet to value life for the sake of the world is something only those who forget the self can do. Thus, the world is made to understand that fame is not worth cherishing, wealth not worth prizing, and only then does one know to value life. Knowing to value life, one then knows to guard the self—this is Laozi’s intent. Those who do not attain it see loss as harmful; once attained, the fear of losing it becomes a harm even greater than loss. Only by equalizing having and lacking, gain and loss, can one be free from harm. Excessive love leads to pursuing all means without restraint—how can there be no expense? Hoarding invites many attackers—how can there be no loss?

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The ardent scholar pursues fame, yet in doing so, maims life and harms nature, unaware that life is dearer than fame. Thus it is said: "Which is dearer, fame or life?" The greedy pursue wealth, yet in doing so, maim life and harm nature, unaware that life is weightier than wealth. Thus it is said: "Which is weightier, life or wealth?" What the scholar pursues is called "noble"; what the greedy pursues is called "base." Though the noble and base differ in their pursuits, both lose what they preserve. Thus, gaining fame or wealth while losing what one preserves is to not know that loss is more harmful than gain. Therefore, it is said: "Which is more harmful, gain or loss?" Thus, loving fame desires to honor one’s life.

To love excessively is to lose even what is most noble—this is great waste. To hoard wealth is to seek enrichment of one’s life, yet through excessive accumulation, one harms even one’s utmost abundance—this is profound loss. Only those of virtue know that the highest nobility resides within and does not depend on fame. Thus, knowing contentment, they avoid disgrace; knowing that utmost abundance resides within and does not depend on wealth, they avoid peril. Without disgrace and without peril, one may endure long.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
Fame is not dearer than life, nor is wealth weightier than life. Gain does not compensate for loss, yet世人 invariably covet fame, drown in wealth, and chase after gain—this stems from their lack of insight. When I love external things excessively, I deplete myself; when I hoard possessions, I burden myself. A little invites disgrace; much invites danger—regret becomes inescapable. The noble person acts otherwise: recognizing that all things are complete within oneself, they turn inward and find sufficiency. Thus, they seek nothing from without, and disgrace cannot befall them. Knowing where to stop—stopping at the utmost Dao—they act only in accord with the Dao. Thus, peril cannot befall them. This is constancy, and constancy enables endurance.

Great accomplishment seems deficient, yet its use never wears out. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use never exhausts. Great straightness seems bent; great skill seems clumsy; great eloquence seems inarticulate. Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. Only clarity and stillness can serve as the norm for all under heaven.

**Su’s Annotation:**
The world deems wholeness as accomplishment, thus accomplishment must decay. It deems fullness as abundance, thus abundance must deplete. The sage aspires to great accomplishment yet does not guard against deficiency; aims for great fullness yet does not abhor emptiness. Thus, accomplishment does not decay, and fullness does not deplete.
Straightness that does not bend will break; following principle in action, though crooked, is straight. Skill that does not appear clumsy will exhaust itself; entrusting things to their nature, though clumsy, is skill. Eloquence that does not appear inarticulate will reach its limit; speaking in accord with principle, though inarticulate, is eloquence. Thus, accomplishment without deficiency, fullness without emptiness, straightness without bending, skill without clumsiness, eloquence without inarticulateness—these are like restlessness that cannot be still, stillness that cannot be restless.
Restlessness can overcome cold but not heat; stillness can overcome heat but not cold. Both are confined to one extreme and are not the true norm. Only through serene clarity, untainted by partiality—neither accomplishment nor deficiency, neither fullness nor emptiness, neither straightness nor bending, neither skill nor clumsiness, neither eloquence nor inarticulateness—can one overcome all and serve as the norm for all under heaven.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
All things begin with *shi* and end with *shi*—this is great accomplishment. Yet the beginning has no true beginning, and the end has no true end, thus it seems deficient. Only because it seems deficient does its use renew daily and never wear out. All things draw from it without exhaustion—this is fullness. Yet adding to it does not increase it, thus it seems empty. Only because it seems empty does its use provide daily without exhaustion.
Great straightness bends to preserve wholeness and yields to become straight, thus it seems bent. Great skill carves myriad forms yet does not claim skill, thus it seems clumsy. Great eloquence does not speak yet persuades, thus it seems inarticulate. There is no other reason—all stem from having a root.
What is this root? Consider cold and heat, which are the workings of heaven and earth, unavoidable by all forms. Yet a moment of restlessness can overcome cold; a moment of stillness can overcome heat. If transient restlessness and stillness can overcome the workings of heaven and earth, how much more can embodying the clarity and stillness of non-action serve as the norm for all under heaven? Thus, in its accomplishment, it seems deficient yet never wears out; in its fullness, it seems empty yet never exhausts. Its straightness seems bent yet extends; its skill seems clumsy yet excels; its eloquence seems inarticulate yet clarifies. This is called having a root.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
Accomplishment and deficiency, emptiness and fullness, straightness and bending, skill and clumsiness, eloquence and inarticulateness—these are all semblances of things. Only the Dao is nameless; seeking it through form yields nothing. Thus, though accomplished, it seems deficient; though full, it seems empty; though straight, it seems bent; though skillful, it seems clumsy; though eloquent, it seems inarticulate. Its accomplishment does not rely on form; its fullness does not rely on vessels; its straightness does not rely on strength; its skill does not rely on the mind; its eloquence does not rely on speech. Thus, the world, seeking it through semblances, cannot grasp it.
Most who speak of the Dao and its arts are partial: restlessness overcomes cold but not heat; stillness overcomes heat but not cold. Each has its limits. Only clarity and stillness, free from action, though not seeking to overcome things, cannot be overcome by anything under heaven. Thus it is said: "Clarity and stillness serve as the norm for all under heaven."

**Ye Mengde’s Annotation:**
Cold and heat are the *qi* of heaven and earth. If one here is restless, one can still overcome cold; if still, one can overcome heat. If one knows what overcomes what, there is nothing one cannot achieve. Clarity overcomes turbidity; stillness overcomes movement—its effects are evident. Yet if one fails to see this and seeks only what overcomes, one will never find the true norm. Only clarity and stillness serve as the norm for all under heaven.

**Wu’s Annotation:**
Taking wholeness as accomplishment, fullness as fullness, straightness as straightness, skill as skill, eloquence as eloquence—this is petty. Seeming deficient yet not whole, seeming empty yet not full, seeming bent yet not straight, seeming clumsy yet not skillful, seeming inarticulate yet not eloquent—these are the great accomplishment, great fullness, great straightness, great skill, and great eloquence.
When the Dao prevails under heaven, warhorses are retired to manure the fields. When the Dao is absent under heaven, warhorses breed at the borders. No crime is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than not knowing contentment; no fault is greater than coveting gain. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.

**Xisheng’s Annotation:**
In an age when the Dao prevails under heaven, though armor and weapons exist, they are unused; though strong horses exist, they are unridden. In an age when the Dao is absent, the Son of Heaven wages war against the four barbarians, and feudal lords invade neighboring states. Thus, weapons move within borders, warhorses gallop across the countryside, mulberry and catalpa are felled for firewood, and brambles grow in the fields.
When a ruler lacks the Dao, his poison afflicts all under heaven. Tracing the source, his evils are three: seeing what he desires, he seeks it against principle—thus no crime is greater. Seeking without cease, he must harm others—thus no disaster is greater. Desiring and obtaining, his heart burns ever brighter—thus no fault is weightier. Yet without being a sage, one cannot be free of desire. With desire, one cannot be free of seeking. Seeking without knowing contentment—this is the gravest disaster.
Alas! All that is not true nature is external things—how can one possess them? Everyone has utmost sufficiency. Knowing the sufficiency of utmost sufficiency, there is nothing one lacks.

Su's Annotation:
When all under heaven abides in its proper place, there is no contention and self-governance arises—thus horses are turned back to manure fields. To display what is desirable to others is already a fault, yet those who never know contentment bring even greater disaster. Those who must obtain what they desire incur the gravest blame. Even a common man who harbors but one of these will suffer its affliction; how much more so for lords and kings who indulge in them—this is the very source of warhorses’ galloping. Only those who know contentment find sufficiency in their dwelling, and thus nothing is lacking.

Lü's Annotation:
When the world follows the Dao, the people’s wisdom and skill are exhausted in plowing and eating, and thievery and strife vanish in the absence of desire—even death is cast off. Thus it is said: "Horses are turned back to manure the fields." When the world lacks the Dao, the sight of what is desirable becomes the root of weaponry; even with fortified borders, order cannot be secured. Thus it is said: "Warhorses are born in the suburbs." Yet what is the origin of these faults? Merely the presence of desire. Thus it is said: "No crime is greater than what is desirable." From desirability arises discontent; even with surplus, one does not cease. Contentment is fortune, surplus is calamity. Thus it is said: "No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment." From not knowing contentment arises the desire to obtain; obtaining what is desired invites resentment and blame, and thus warfare never ends. Thus it is said: "No fault is weightier than the desire to obtain." Those who do not know contentment, though they may have enough, never feel sufficient; but those who know the sufficiency of sufficiency are always content—this is evident.

Xizhai's Annotation:
When the world follows the Dao, it can turn weapons into tools for the people; when the world lacks the Dao, it turns the people into weapons. One who knows the Dao can transform form into emptiness; one who does not know the Dao turns emptiness into form. What is desirable is attachment; not knowing contentment is grasping; the desire to obtain is possession. From attachment arises grasping, from grasping arises possession, and from manifold possession arises endless blame. If one knows that grasping need not extend beyond oneself, this is called knowing contentment. Knowing contentment, nothing is lacking.

Without stepping outside, one knows all under heaven; without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Thus the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, and accomplishes without acting.

Su's Annotation:
The essence of inherent nature pervades the cosmos, undifferentiated by distance, past, or present. The sages of old, though they did not step outside their doors or windows, knew all things because their nature was whole. The people of this world, obscured by external things, divide their nature between ears and eyes, inwardly disturbed by body and mind, outwardly blocked by mountains and rivers. Their sight does not extend beyond their gaze, their hearing does not reach beyond their doors and windows—these slight barriers can sever and isolate them. Unaware that the sage restores nature to its fullness, they seek knowledge by going out, and thus the farther they go, the less they know. What nature reaches is not merely knowing or naming; it can also bring about accomplishment through the natural course of things without effort.

Lü's Annotation:
What makes all under heaven "all under heaven"? Seeing what makes all under heaven "all under heaven," one knows it without stepping outside. What makes the Dao of heaven "the Dao of heaven"? Seeing what makes the Dao of heaven "the Dao of heaven," one sees it without peering through the window. Now, the vastness of all under heaven is boundless; if one must go out to know it, the reach of one’s feet is limited—how much can one know? The remoteness of the Dao of heaven is unfathomable; if one must peer to see it, the reach of one’s eyes is limited—how much can one see? Thus it is said: "The farther one goes, the less one knows." Therefore, the sage, knowing what makes all under heaven "all under heaven," knows without traveling; seeing what makes the Dao of heaven "the Dao of heaven," names without seeing. Why? Because it is complete within oneself. Knowing what is not traveled, naming what is not seen—thus one accomplishes without acting.

Zhang'an's Annotation:
Stepping outside, one knows only what can be known; peering through the window, one sees only what can be seen. The vastness of all under heaven, the breadth of the Dao of heaven—how can they be encompassed by knowing or seeing? Stepping outside, one leaves this and gains some knowledge—how much can one know? Peering through the window, one focuses on that and gains some sight—how far can one see? The sage operates in silent transformation, not relying on knowing to know, thus nothing is unknown; not relying on seeing to see, thus nothing is unseen. All under heaven is where things reside, made so by circumstances. The Dao of heaven is where the Dao resides, naturally so. Its coarse aspect lies in things, its subtle aspect in the Dao—both are fully realized without leaving the present state. What need is there for stepping outside or peering through? Stepping outside implies movement; peering through implies seeing. The sage does not travel but relies on wisdom, does not see but relies on the mind. Thus the affairs of all under heaven can all be known, the subtleties of the Dao of heaven can all be named. Being able to know and name, one accomplishes without acting, bringing about what naturally comes to be.

Xizhai's Annotation:
Going out to seek heaven and earth is to seek their form. Heaven and earth cannot be exhausted by form but can be exhausted by principle. Thus the farther one goes, the less one knows. If one knows that their principle resides here, even with doors closed, it is sufficient. The sage knows that knowledge does not lie in form, thus need not travel; names do not lie in appearance, thus need not see; accomplishment does not lie in affairs, thus need not act.

In learning, one accumulates daily; in cultivating the Dao, one diminishes daily. Diminish and further diminish until reaching non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone. Thus, to take all under heaven, one always does so through non-affair. When there is affair, it is insufficient to take all under heaven.

[Annotation from the *Kaiyuan Commentary*: "Taking" is like governing and transforming. Non-affair is non-action. Through non-action, self-transformation occurs; through tranquility, self-rectification arises. Thus it is said: "To take all under heaven, one always does so through non-affair." Acting is ruinous; grasping is loss. Thus it is said: "When there is affair, it is insufficient to take all under heaven."]

Kumarajiva's Annotation:
To diminish is to eliminate all that is coarse until nothing remains unabandoned. Abandonment reaches the point of guarding against evil, then nothing subtle remains unremoved. Removal reaches the point of guarding against both good and evil—evil is not, good is so. Having diminished what is not, one further diminishes what is. Thus it is said: "Diminish and further diminish." Both is and is not are guarded against; emotions and desires are severed, and virtue unites with the Dao, reaching non-action. Though non-action, one allows the self-acting of the myriad things—thus nothing is left undone.

Su's Annotation:
Not knowing the Dao but pursuing learning, one’s hearing and seeing accumulate daily, yet without unity, they inevitably become burdens. Confucius said: "Hear much, select what is good and follow it; see much and remember it—this is secondary knowledge." If one knows the Dao in a single day, one regards the myriad things as nothing but illusion. Abandoning illusion to seek the restoration of inherent nature—this is called diminishing. Confucius said to Zigong: "Do you take me for one who learns much and remembers it?" "Yes," he replied. "It is not so," said Confucius. "I unify it with one thread." Abandoning illusion to seek the restoration of inherent nature can be called diminishing, yet the mind that abandons illusion still remains. Only when this mind is fully guarded, and inherent nature is pure and without residue, can one act without departing from non-action. People all have the desire to take all under heaven, thus they create affairs to seek it. Their minds manifest externally, and things resent them—thus they ultimately cannot obtain it. The sage, through non-action, has no affairs; their mind manifests externally, and things are at peace. Though they do not take all under heaven, all under heaven returns to them.

The Lü commentary states: Those who engage in learning have yet to hear the Dao. Those who have not heard the Dao and seek it cannot but be broad, hence the saying "daily increase." Those who practice the Dao have already heard the Dao. Having heard the Dao and practicing it, they aim only at non-action, hence the saying "daily diminution." Yet even in this diminution, one remains within the realm of action. Only by diminishing even the act of diminution itself does one attain non-action. Non-action means having nothing, yet "nothing is not done" is precisely how one achieves the absence of absence. This is called "abandoning learning and ending sorrow." To be without sorrow is to be spirit-like. The spirit-like is that which treats all things as things yet is not a thing itself—how then could it have any difficulty in taking all under heaven? From this perspective, taking all under heaven is always accomplished through non-action; when there is action, it is insufficient to take all under heaven. Observing how Zhuang Zhou responded to the emperor and kings, and deeply inquiring into it, one may come to understand this.

The Huang Maocai commentary states: Only when one knows all things can one speak of learning, hence learning seeks daily increase. Only after transformation is complete can one speak of the Dao, hence the Dao seeks daily diminution. Yet increase can be advanced, while diminution cannot be forced. If one has not fully guarded against the act of diminution, it is not yet true diminution. One must suddenly break free, severing past and future, to reach the state of non-action. Only then can one act without limitation, responding endlessly, and apply this to all under heaven with ease.

The Xizhai commentary states: Learning is for the sake of seeking knowledge, hence the saying "daily increase." Practicing the Dao is for the sake of eliminating illusion, hence the saying "daily diminution." If knowledge is not exhaustive, diminution is not complete, hence "increase is the means to daily diminution." If one diminishes and diminishes again until illusion is gone and inherent nature is whole, one attains non-action. Upon reaching non-action, all actions are in fact non-action—this cannot easily be discussed in terms of increase or diminution. When non-action is perfected, even taking all under heaven as one’s own would not appear as an affair. If one were to take it through action, not even a single thing could be obtained, let alone all under heaven?

The sage has no constant mind but takes the minds of the common people as his mind. To the good, he responds with goodness; to the not good, he also responds with goodness—thus his virtue is goodness. To the trustworthy, he responds with trust; to the untrustworthy, he also responds with trust—thus his virtue is trust. The sage in the world is apprehensive, blending his mind with the world. The common people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.

[No constant mind: the mind has no fixed attachment. Apprehensive: pronounced *dédé* (協反), *wéi* in the departing tone (去聲). Blending: pronounced *hún* (胡本反).]

The Su commentary states: The empty and formless takes the forms of the myriad things as its form—if it were square where things are square, round where things are round, how could the formless give form to the myriad things? Thus the sage has no mind but takes the minds of the common people as his mind. Whether good or not good, he responds with goodness; whether trustworthy or not, he responds with trust. Goodness and its absence lie with them, but my way of responding with goodness never changes—this may be called the virtue of goodness. Trustworthiness and its absence lie with them, but my way of responding with trust never alters—this may be called the virtue of trust. Otherwise, if one were to favor the good and abandon the not good, trust the trustworthy and abandon the untrustworthy, how could this be called "constantly good at saving people, hence abandoning none"? The world’s judgments of good and evil, trust and deceit, are each self-righteous, leading to mutual opposition and harm, with no resolution in sight. The sage worries over this, hence his apprehensiveness, blending his mind with the world. Without good or evil, without trust or deceit, he treats all with unity. While the people fix their ears and eyes to observe the sage’s judgments, he meets them all as infants. Toward the good, he feels no delight; toward the evil, he feels no resentment. Thus, the good do not become proud, the evil do not become resentful, and all are transformed, bringing peace to the world.

The Lü commentary states: The human mind—how spirit-like it is!

Alas! Hold to it and it remains; release it and it vanishes. It comes and goes without fixed time, and none know its direction. Since holding preserves and releasing loses it, it has no constant form to be measured; since it comes and goes without fixed time, it cannot be sought in past or present; since none know its direction, it cannot be found in any place or location. Such is the nature of the spirit—so too is the human mind. The sage first attains the fullness of this mind of mine, and thus has no constant mind but takes the minds of the common people as his mind. Like a mirror, it has no constant form but takes the form of whatever it reflects. The sage regards his own mind in this way, and so regards the minds of the common people likewise. Then what constancy can there be in good or evil, trust or deceit? Therefore, the good I treat as good, and the not-good I also treat as good, knowing that the goodness or not-goodness of their minds is inconstant and thus I respond with the virtue of goodness. The trustworthy I trust, and the untrustworthy I also trust, knowing that the trustworthiness or untrustworthiness of their minds is likewise inconstant and thus I respond with the virtue of trust.

That by which things are enabled to live is called *virtue*; that by which the form and body preserve the spirit, each according to its proper pattern, is called *nature*. When nature is cultivated and returns to virtue, and virtue reaches the point of unity with the origin, then it is clear that virtue is what nature arises from, and there is no ungoodness or untrustworthiness.

The sage in the world is apprehensive without cease, blending the minds of the common people. Blending their minds means ensuring that the good and trustworthy do not consider themselves exceptional, and the not-good and untrustworthy do not abandon themselves. The common people all fix their ears and eyes on the sage’s seeing and hearing, yet the sage treats them all as infants. Treating them as infants means meeting them with kindness and serving them with generosity. Though there be the not-good and untrustworthy, he still treats them as good and trustworthy, knowing that the inconstancy of their minds is no different from his own.

Yuanze’s commentary states: Good and evil arise from partial perception; partial perception arises from self-interest. When one is impartial toward the Great Dao, though the eyes see good and evil, the mind harbors no distinction. Thus, the sage follows the world’s sentiments, forcibly establishing praise and blame, yet knows that good and evil are not their true reality. Therefore, treating the not-good as good is not out of pity or forbearance but arises from not perceiving any difference. Guarding against the reality of good and evil is true goodness. Thus, though the myriad dharmas differ, they are equally real; trust and distrust are blended into one. Knowing that all appearances are partial, he can regard the not-good as good; knowing that all appearances are real, he can regard the untrustworthy as trustworthy. When partiality knows reality, and reality knows partiality—this is how the sage’s wisdom differs from that of the common people.

Xizhai’s commentary states: How extreme it is!

The heart as a harm to the world—Zhuangzi said, "No thief is greater than virtue with a heart, and a heart with eyes." For the heart, as a thing, permeates heaven and earth, reaching everywhere without limit. Yet世人 merely take discrimination as the heart; the discriminating heart gives rise to partiality, and with partiality comes seeing, thus obstructing wholeness. This is why Zhuang Zhou called it a thief.

The sage’s heart constantly abides with the Dao. The Dao is nowhere absent, and thus his heart is likewise nowhere absent. Therefore, he has no fixed heart. When he emerges to respond to the world, he knows that all appearances follow from partiality, so the heart of acceptance and rejection never arises. What is good, he follows as good; what is not good, he also follows as good. In the world, nothing is not good—this is called "virtue-goodness." What is trustworthy, he follows as trustworthy; what is untrustworthy, he also follows as trustworthy. In the world, nothing is not trustworthy—this is called "virtue-trust." Yet he remains ever vigilant, fearing that the world’s people, with virtue possessing a heart and the heart possessing eyes, will carve and chisel, grasping and rejecting, failing to see the great whole. Thus, they take what their ears and eyes encounter as clarity, unaware that it is not true clarity.

The sage treats all as infants, nurturing them so they are not disturbed by false clarity. Then, is this false clarity not what Śākya meant by *avidyā*?

Hongfu’s commentary states: The common people have good and not-good, trustworthy and untrustworthy, yet the sage treats all as good and all as trustworthy. How could the sage ever have a heart of goodness or trust? He simply takes the hearts of the people as good and trustworthy—this is called "shared-virtue goodness," not the goodness of one person, and "shared-virtue trust," not the trust of one self. Thus, it is said: "virtue-goodness, virtue-trust." The people of the world have long been divided, each with their own heart. The sage unites the hearts of all into one. The common people fix their ears and eyes, observing others through themselves and viewing themselves through others, each asserting right and wrong, unable to unify. The sage, seeing this, neither rejoices at one nor angers at another, treating all as infants. Thus, they neither boast nor resent, all dissolve in harmony, and the world is at peace. The sage has no fixed heart, taking the hearts of the people as his own. Such is the great barrier by which the Highest governs the world, enabling effortless rule.

Emerging from life, entering death: Of those who follow life, there are thirteen; of those who follow death, there are thirteen; and of those who, while living, move toward the realm of death, there are also thirteen. Why is this? Because they cling excessively to life. It is said that those skilled in nurturing life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without avoiding armor or weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they have no realm of death.

*(Emerging refers to moving from non-being into being; entering refers to returning from being into non-being. Zhuangzi said, "The myriad things all emerge from the mechanism and enter the mechanism." Elsewhere, he said, "Their emergence brings no joy; their entrance brings no reluctance." Again, he said, "There is emergence, there is entrance"—all taking emergence as life and entrance as death. The term *she-sheng* (nurturing life) is like *she-zheng* (regency) or *she-guan* (acting official)—not claiming life as one’s own possession, but temporarily overseeing it, as in provisional governance. *Encounter* means unplanned meeting. *Si* (rhinoceros) is pronounced like *si* in *Shanhaijing*: "Rhinoceroses emerge south of the Xiang River, dark in color." The *Erya* states: "In form like a wild ox, with one horn, weighing a thousand pounds.")*

Su’s commentary states: Nature has no life or death. Emergence is life; entrance is death. Those who use things to extract essence and nourish themselves belong to the realm of life. Those who harm themselves with sounds, colors, scents, and tastes belong to the realm of death. These two are already divided into the paths of life and death. I also know action but not rest, speech but not silence, thought but not prevention, exhausting oneself to the end—these are what is meant by "moving toward the realm of death." The paths of life and death are spoken of in tens: three belong to each. Is it not that the paths of life and death are nine, while the path of neither life nor death is one alone? Neither life nor death is what the *Yi* calls "serene and unmoving." Laozi speaks of the nine but not the one, allowing people to discover it for themselves, lodging the marvel of non-thought and non-action. Where there is life, there is death, so those who follow life are also those who follow death. The more people rely on life, the more the path of death dominates. The sage constantly abides in neither life nor death—how could there be a realm of death for him?

Lü’s commentary states: Those who live are followers of death; death is the beginning of life. Thus, life and death are but mutual emergence and entrance. Of those who follow life, thirteen are those who attain life through life, not by mere luck. Of those who follow death, thirteen are those who attain death through death, not by misfortune. Of the people who, while living, move toward the realm of death, thirteen are those who nourish their inner like leopards yet are devoured externally like tigers, or fortify their outer like armor yet are attacked internally by illness. They do not fail to pursue life, yet by not grasping the Way, they move toward the realm of death. Why is this? Because they cling excessively to life. Those who attain life through life or death through death need not be discussed. But those who pursue life yet reverse into death—this is where their error lies.

It is said that those skilled in nurturing life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without being struck by armor or weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they have no realm of death. Laozi has already embodied this in his words, yet he speaks in doubtful terms, testing with questions. Is this not what Zhuangzi called "weighty words"? Let us examine it: People encounter tigers and rhinoceroses or are struck by armor and weapons because they have a self. If I observe my heart and know not its whereabouts, then my heart cannot be grasped. If my heart cannot be grasped, then my self and things also cannot be grasped. Internally, no self is seen; externally, no things are seen. Then what is the realm of death? What are tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, or weapons to thrust their horns, place their claws, or lodge their blades? How could one who nurtures life surpass this?

Yuanzhe’s commentary states: The perfect person knows neither death nor life, thus neither can die nor live. Therefore, it is said: "They have never died, never lived." Those who incline toward yin and yang and follow life and death, as well as those who indulge desires and invite misfortune, moving toward the realm of death—these three groups differ in their views, yet the source of their delusion from the supreme correctness of the great Dao, leading them to be bound by life and death, lies in their partiality toward life and excessive attachment to it.

Should one ask: "Those who pursue the Dao and reach emaciation—do they not contradict the profound nurturance of life?" I reply: What I call "I" is neither dead nor alive, abiding in constancy and unity; one must only cease attachment, whereas they cling to their views and thus become withered. Though their aspiration inclines toward emptiness and stillness, they remain unaware that this is the height of self-grasping.

One who has no realm of death does so because they have no life. One who has no life abides in constant life yet does not regard it as "life"—thus they have never died, never lived. The Dao reaches this point.

Here, though the form may appear to change, the spirit has never altered—how could death occur? These are the divine sages of the Middle Kingdom and the Buddhas of the Western Lands. In such a state, transformations are boundless; water and fire cannot scorch or drown, blades and blows cannot wound. Illness may exploit emptiness and strike the solid, yet nothing obstructs their passage. Desires may seek to possess them, yet how could they cause harm?

Should one ask: "Then why speak of nurturing life?" I say: To descend even one level is to be subject to life and death. Thus, nurturing life must attain this state before life abides eternally. Compared to those who embody profound virtue, this is the ultimate.

**The Brush Chariot**

Of those who follow life, thirteen in ten are those who refine the form to dwell in the world. Of those who follow death, thirteen in ten are those who indulge desires and obstruct life. Of those who move toward the realm of death, thirteen in ten are those who sever their inherent nature. In these ten parts, nine are generally those of abundant life. Since having life necessarily entails death, life is inherently the ground of death. How can one evade rhinoceroses, tigers, armor, and weapons? Only by nurturing life to attain the state of no-life. Thus, the rhinoceros’s horn finds no target, the tiger’s claws have no place to strike, and the blade’s edge has no opening to enter—why? Because there is no ground to receive them. Nine are those of abundant life; one is of no-life. Laozi, among these ten, omits one to subtly align with this principle. Yet the sage does not attain no-life by deliberately diminishing it—it is inherently no-life.

As the ancients said: "Those who cling to life may be slain; those who cling to purity may be defiled; those who cling to honor may be humiliated; those who cling to wholeness may be broken." If there is inherently no life, who can slay it? If there is inherently no defense, who can defile it? If there is inherently no honor, who can humiliate it? If there is inherently no wholeness, who can break it? Knowing this, one may enter and exit creation, playfully roaming through life and death.

**Cheng Ju’s Discourse**

Of all transformations in the myriad things, none is greater than life and death. For one who follows the Way and transcends the boundary of life and death, nothing remains. Does life truly come? Does death truly depart? If life is taken as real arrival, then the source from which I come should be knowable—whether from north or south, east or west, above or below. Yet these cannot be spoken of; how can one call it real arrival? If death is taken as real abiding, then the destination to which I depart should be knowable—whether mind, thing, person, or heaven. Yet these cannot be spoken of; how can one call it real departure?

Thus, my life arises without knowing its beginning, ceases without knowing its end, yet spans the ages in unbroken continuity—serene and constant. Only then does one clearly realize that I have never been born, never died. Why then be confined to the realm of death?

---

**The Dao gives them life, its virtue rears them; things give them form, circumstances complete them.** Thus, the myriad things none fail to honor the Dao and esteem its virtue. The Dao’s honor and virtue’s esteem arise not from conferred rank but are ever naturally so. Therefore, the Dao gives life, rears, nurtures, matures, refines, nourishes, and shelters them—yet claims no possession, acts without reliance, and leads without domination. This is called **profound virtue**.

---

**Hisheng’s Annotation**

Only after things are born are they reared; only after being reared do they take form; only after taking form are they completed. What gives them life is the Dao; what rears them is virtue. What shapes their material is human effort; what fulfills their function is circumstance. The myriad things honor the Dao because it gives life, and esteem virtue because it rears. Since the Dao and virtue give life and rear, they are naturally revered by the myriad things—how could this honor and esteem depend on conferred rank?

Yet the Dao is the essence of true purity, while virtue is the function of wondrous things. Essence can encompass function, but function cannot encompass essence. The Dao can embody virtue, but virtue cannot embody the Dao. Thus, receiving its essence is called life; containing its qi is called rearing; developing its form is called growth; nurturing its material is called cultivation; adjusting its completion is called refinement; measuring its use is called tempering; preserving its harmony is called nourishment; preventing its harm is called shelter. This is the Great Dao.

Having given life, it does not claim possession; having acted, it does not boast reliance; having led, it does not dominate. This is called **profound virtue**. The preceding chapter speaks of humans aligning with the Dao and virtue; this chapter speaks of the Dao and virtue aligning with humans. Thus, the wording is similar, yet the principles are interconnected.

---

**Su’s Annotation**

The Dao is the mother of the myriad things; thus, what gives life to the myriad things is the Dao. When it operates as virtue, it herds and nurtures the multitude without refusal—thus, what rears the myriad things is virtue. Yet the Dao and virtue cannot take form on their own; they manifest only through things. Things cannot complete themselves; through the interplay of near and far, hard and soft, circumstances accumulate into momentum, and then the transformations of rise and fall, order and chaos are accomplished.

Though form arises from things and completion from circumstances, without the Dao, there is no life; without virtue, there is no rearing. Thus, the Dao is honored like father and elder brother, and virtue is esteemed like lord and king—because the Dao has no rank, while virtue has a name. Those who rely on rank for honor and esteem are not truly honored or esteemed.

---

**Lü’s Annotation**

The life of the myriad things always originates from the nameless, and their rearing always lies in the One before form. The nameless is the Dao; the One before form, from which things receive life, is virtue. When they become things, they merely take form—this is not what gives life or rears. Once form exists, the naked cannot but be naked, the scaled, shelled, feathered, and furred cannot but be scaled, shelled, feathered, and furred, and they cannot but progress through youth, prime, aging, and death—all the inevitable momentum of circumstance.

Thus, it is said: "The Dao gives them life, its virtue rears them; things give them form, circumstances complete them." Circumstance arises from form, form from virtue, virtue from the Dao. The Dao and virtue are the root; form and circumstance are the branches. The root is honored, the branches base; the root is esteemed, the branches lowly. Thus, the myriad things none fail to honor the Dao and esteem its virtue. The Dao’s honor and virtue’s esteem arise not from conferred rank but are ever naturally so. This is why it can, through the softness and weakness of non-action, overcome the hardness and strength of form and circumstance. The reason kings and lords transform the myriad things lies here, not there.

Yet, though it is said that the Dao gives life, its virtue rears, things give form, and circumstances complete them, in essence, to give life, rear, nurture, mature, refine, temper, nourish, and shelter—all is the Dao. And the Dao ultimately has no name. Thus, it is said: "Gives life yet claims no possession, acts without reliance, leads without domination—this is called **profound virtue**."

---

**Yuanzhe’s Annotation**

These four—life, rearing, form, and circumstance—are all the Dao. Because each attains its proper Dao, they are merely called virtue. As virtue, it only rears. Yet the rearing that constitutes virtue, when it attains its fulfillment and takes form, becomes merely things. Once things have form, near and far interact, hard and soft engage, each following its circumstance to complete its state. Thus, virtue is the Dao’s division; things are virtue’s vessels; circumstance is the principle of things.

Understanding the Dao and virtue, one sees that form and circumstance are not worth knowing, and responding to all things becomes effortless. When commanded by heaven, one is the Son of Heaven; when commanded by the Son of Heaven, one is a lord. Having received a command, the one who issues it can demean the recipient. Only the Dao precedes the myriad things and controls their destiny—who can usurp this? Thus, it is ever naturally so.

息斋’s Annotation:
Things do not arise without the Dao, nor are they reared without virtue. From their having form to their flourishing in circumstance, all take the Dao and virtue as their master. The Dao’s exaltation and virtue’s nobility reach their utmost here—yet they do not exalt themselves in their exaltation, nor prize themselves in their prized status. Their bestowal upon things is not deliberate toward things. None commands them, yet they are ever naturally so. That they naturally give rise to and naturally rear, that they nurture, mature, nourish, and shelter—all is natural. Because it is natural, they never expect recompense from things; in giving, they do not shirk labor; in bestowing, they do not seek repayment. This is called dark virtue.

The world has a beginning that serves as the world’s mother. Having attained this mother, one thereby knows her child. Having known her child, one then guards her mother—thus, to the end of one’s days, one does not fall into peril. Block its apertures, shut its gates, and one will not toil all one’s life. Open its apertures, aid its affairs, and one will not be saved all one’s life. Seeing the small is called illumination; guarding the soft is called strength. Employing one’s light, one returns to one’s clarity—no calamity will befall one’s person. This is called inheriting the constant.

Su’s Annotation:
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things. When the Dao is still nameless, it is that upon which things rely for their beginning. When it has a name, it is that upon which things rely for their arising. Thus, it is called the beginning and also the mother; its child is the myriad things. The sage embodies the Dao to encompass all things, just as knowing the mother allows one to know her child—all is clear and nothing is left unexamined. Though their wisdom can encompass all things, they never use things to obstruct the Dao, and thus they guard their mother to the end. The world all possesses this Dao, yet they constantly err by obstructing the Dao to pursue things. The eyes delight in forms, the ears in sounds—opening the heart that delights in these and aiding its affairs with them, one sinks into ruin all one’s life and cannot be saved. The sage’s way of never toiling all one’s life lies solely in blocking and shutting, never issuing forth to pursue things. The harm of delight begins small and gradually grows. Knowing the small before it becomes great and blocking it—this is called illumination. Pursuing what delights one without reflection, believing oneself strong when one is not—this is not strength. Only seeing delight and knowing to fear it is called strength. The common people open what delights them and follow things with their persons, going forth and never returning. The sage blocks and shuts, not cutting off from things but responding to them with spirit, employing their light while the self does not engage. The ear’s ability to hear, the eye’s to see, the nose’s to smell, the mouth’s to taste, the body’s to touch, the mind’s to think—all are what is called light. Light engages with things, and though things depart, clarity suffers no loss. Thus, one responds to the myriad changes without exhaustion, and calamity does not reach one’s person. Therefore, one’s constant nature remains serene, inheriting and unbroken.

Lü’s Annotation:
The world has a beginning that serves as the world’s mother—this is what the Classic means when it says, “I do not know its name; I style it the Dao.” The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things. The Dao is ever nameless and serves as the world’s mother—why? Because the named is merely the mother of the myriad things and is not sufficient to be the world’s mother. The nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth, gives rise to all below heaven from the nameless. Thus, it is said, “The world has a beginning that serves as the world’s mother.” Hearing the Dao is easy; attaining the Dao is difficult. Attaining the Dao is easy; guarding the Dao is difficult. Now that I have attained this mother and harmonized with it in mind—not merely hearing it but truly knowing it—I know that all things in the world are what I give rise to. Knowing that all things in the world are what I give rise to and constantly guarding this without loss, who in the world could use what I give rise to harm that from which it arises? This is why one does not fall into peril to the end of one’s days. Blocking its apertures and shutting its gates, one does not toil all one’s life—this is what it means to guard one’s mother. The heart moves within, and one indulges it—this is called having apertures. With apertures, the heart issues forth to engage with things. I block its apertures so they do not open; not opening, the heart does not issue forth. Things entice from without, and one admits them—this is called having gates. With gates, things enter and disturb the heart. I shut its gates so they are not admitted; not admitted, things do not enter. Within, nothing issues forth; without, nothing enters. Though the myriad things change endlessly before one, each returns to its root, and one remains unaware—how could there be toil? The ancients had those who could set aside the heart and employ the form—this was their way. If one opens one’s apertures and does not block them, aids one’s affairs and does not diminish them, then one’s heart becomes merely an inn for things. With nothing to rely upon, how can one not perish? This is why one is not saved all one’s life. Only by guarding one’s mother does one, upon seeing the heart’s incipient movement, remain still and unmoving. Still and unmoving, one responds and thoroughly penetrates the world’s patterns. Thus, it is said, “Seeing the small is called illumination; guarding the soft is called strength.” Guarding the utmost softness of the formless, nothing can overcome it—thus, it is said, “Guarding the soft is called strength.” Having employed one’s light to illuminate the incipient movement, one returns to one’s clarity and reverts to stillness. Then, one never opens apertures or aids affairs to the point of being unsaved—how could calamity befall? In this way, one inherits the harmony of knowing and remains profoundly unseen. Thus, it is said, “Employing one’s light, one returns to one’s clarity—no calamity will befall one’s person. This is called inheriting the constant.”

息斋’s Annotation:
The Dao is the mother of things; things are the children of the Dao. The ancients who attained the Dao could keep mother and child undivided, making Dao and things one. Things issue from the Dao; things do not differ from the Dao. Children issue from the mother; children do not differ from the mother. Things do not differ from the Dao, yet the world seeks the Dao by abandoning things. Children do not differ from the mother, yet the world seeks the mother by abandoning children. Fundamentally undivided, they divide themselves—thus, they never attain unity. If one knows that things are the Dao and children are the mother, and knows and guards this, then one meets the source everywhere without difficulty. All things do not employ the Dao themselves; employing things to abandon the Dao—this is because people open their apertures.

The aperture is a protrusion—pierce its protrusion to satisfy desire, and the heart drifts while essence wanes. Then things follow and defenses must be closed. Seal the aperture, bar the gate, and spirit will not stray outward. Returning to the origin, it naturally reverts; mother and child remain undivided, Dao and things become one. The ancients who preserved their persons and thus preserved their lives employed this Way.

The affliction of people lies in their failure to guard the small or nurture their defenses. If from the smallest matters one is vigilant, and from the first defenses one cultivates, then even the small will become clear, even the weak will grow strong. Thus it is said: "To see the small is called clarity; to know softness is called strength." Clarity is the root. Light is what clarity arises from. The original clarity is the root; its branches divide into seeing, hearing, awareness, and touch—all are its light.

The Dao flows from the root to the branches; learning seeks the root from the branches. Thus it is said: "Employ its light to return to its clarity"—this is called "inheriting the constant." The constant is the root; light arises from clarity. Now, by using light to return to clarity, it is said: "inheriting the constant."

Were I to be steadfast in awareness and walk the great Way, I would fear only deviation. The great Way is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways. The court is excessively adorned, the fields are overgrown, the granaries are empty. They wear embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth—this is called the "bandit’s pipe," far from the Dao!

*[Annotation: "Steadfast in awareness" means to be vigilant in awareness. "Deviation" is the opposite of frugality. "Level" means flat; narrow paths are called byways. "Adorned" means cultivated; it is said in the *Zuo Zhuan*: "To manure and repair the dilapidated huts of one’s ancestors." Blue and red are "pattern"; silk is "embroidery." In the *Zhan Guo Ce*, "embroidery" is the ancient form of "brocade." "Wealth" is also written as "property." "Bandit’s pipe" was mistakenly written as "bandit’s boast"; here following the *Han Feizi* version.]*

**Han Feizi’s Explanation:**
"Excessively adorned" means the court is over-embellished. When litigation is rampant, the fields are neglected; when the fields are neglected, the granaries empty; when the granaries empty, the state grows poor; when the state is poor, the people’s customs turn to extravagance. When customs turn to extravagance, the livelihoods of clothing and food are severed; when livelihoods are severed, the people cannot but adorn themselves with cunning deceit. Adorning themselves with cunning deceit is called "wearing embroidered robes." When litigation is rampant and granaries empty, yet extravagance becomes custom, the state is harmed—like being stabbed with a sharp sword. Thus it is said: "gird themselves with sharp swords." Those who harm the state through such adornment of wisdom must enrich their private households. When private households are enriched, it is said: "hoard surplus wealth." When the state is in such a state, the foolish people cannot but imitate it. Imitating it, petty thieves arise. From this perspective, when great villains act, petty thieves follow; when great villains lead, petty thieves harmonize. The *yu* is the chief of the five notes; when the *yu* leads, bells and lutes follow. When the *yu* plays, all music harmonizes. Now, when great villains act, the vulgar people lead; when the vulgar people lead, petty thieves must harmonize. Thus, those who wear embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth are called "bandit’s pipes."

**Xisheng’s Annotation:**
When Master Lao says, "Were I clamorously devoid of a heart that knows the Dao," he begins by desiring to align with the world, making whatever he does his sole concern—striving only to conform superficially to the world.

Should I possess even the slightest clarity of the constant Dao, I would walk the great Way, acting only where fitting—yet ever fearful of deviating from the great Way. For the great Way is like a thoroughfare: level and smooth, with no path it does not reach. Its vast straightness brooks no concern for minor detours, yet worldly men, eager for speed, take shortcuts—thus stumbling into confusion, losing their way. The sage laments this, cautious in his teachings, ever wary of guiding the people onto crooked paths that ultimately fail to align with the great Way.

Alas! Enter a state, and its governance may be known. Observe its court and halls, grandly adorned with carved and towering walls, and you will know its lord delights in earthworks and frivolous amusements. Observe its fields lying fallow, and you will know its lord favors corvée labor, seizing the people’s time. Observe its granaries empty, and you will know its lord promotes secondary crafts while neglecting fundamental industries. Observe its robes heavy with embroidery, and you will know its lord indulges in excess and crafty adornments, wasting women’s labor. Observe its girdles hung with sharp swords, and you will know its lord prizes martial valor, breeding state calamities. Observe its feasts ever sated and lavish, and you will know its lord pursues drunkenness and gluttony, forgetting the people’s affairs. Observe its wealth and goods ever in surplus, and you will know its lord delights in amassing riches, draining the people’s resources.

All these instances are the stealthy exploitation of the people’s strength for ostentatious display—thus they are called "bandit’s boasting." Such bandit’s boasting is no governance of the Dao. Yet this "stealthy exploitation" means taking in secret while the people remain unaware. Is this not what is meant by "acting only where fitting—yet ever fearful"?

Su's Annotation:
Those who embody the Dao possess neither knowledge nor action, nor any contrivance—yet things transform of themselves. Now, if one rigidly clings to knowledge and acts upon the great Dao, then contrivance and establishment arise, departing from naturalness. Here lies what is to be feared. The great Dao is level and smooth, without peril or obstruction. Yet the world, failing to comprehend, deems it circuitous and distant, preferring shortcuts in pursuit of swiftness. Thus, all who abandon naturalness to contrive and impose do so in haste. The vulgar are bright and clear, while I alone seem dim; the vulgar are sharp and discerning, while I alone appear dull. How could one further adorn the superficial, neglect the fundamental, and make contrivance their business, boasting to instruct bandits?

Lü's Annotation:
The noble person, in relation to the Dao, cannot but hollow out the heart. When the heart is hollowed to its depths, though ten thousand changes unfold before them, they remain undisturbed in stillness. What contrivance could then inspire fear? If I cannot hollow my heart and instead cling to rigid knowledge, acting upon the great Dao, then I must ever fear contrivance, and the pursuit of a path without peril becomes unattainable. How much more so for those who open their senses and expedite their affairs? The essence of the great Dao lies in knowing without knowledge—this is its utmost levelness. Yet the people seek it through knowledge, preferring shortcuts while ignorant of the proper course.

Man’s life takes food as its root, and food necessarily arises from the fields. When fields are well-tended, granaries fill; when granaries are full, food suffices; when food suffices, wealth abounds; when wealth abounds, the court is well-ordered. This is to know the source from which the root arises. Now, if one acts upon the great Dao with a heart clinging to rigid knowledge, one has already lost the mother. Losing the mother, the child is no longer one’s own. To take what is not one’s own—like sweeping the courtyard while letting the fields grow wild, the granaries empty, yet donning embroidered robes, girding sharp swords, sating oneself with food and drink, and hoarding surplus wealth—is to take what is not one’s own. Without bandit’s boasting, this could not be. How could this be the Dao?

Here follows the translation:

Xi Zhai’s Annotation: The Dao does not reside in knowledge—knowledge is but the machinations of the mind. The true Dao must be luminous, yet this luminosity is not knowledge; knowledge cannot attain it. Thus, when applied, it is inexhaustible; when employed, it is boundless. If I proceed along the great Dao with a heart clinging to rigid knowledge, what I know is limited, while the Dao is infinite. Trembling with fear that my application will prove insufficient—this is to dread only the act of application. The great Dao is utterly plain, yet the people prefer shortcuts. Those who prefer shortcuts make knowledge a thief.

If one acts with non-knowing, then all that is seen and heard is nothing but the Dao. How vast and expansive the heart becomes, how at ease and at rest the days! Later ages are not so. When the court is excessively adorned, this is governance; yet when the court is adorned, external embellishments multiply. When fields lie fallow, the heart is not governed; when granaries are empty, conduct is not cultivated. Then one dons embroidered robes to impress others, girds sharp swords to overawe the multitude, and amasses food, drink, and wealth without putting them to use—this is called bandit’s boasting. Thus, one strays far from the Dao.

Those who build well cannot be uprooted; those who embrace well cannot be torn away. Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease. Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true. Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue overflows. Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue endures. Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue abounds. Cultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal. Thus, observe the self through the self, observe the family through the family, observe the village through the village, observe the state through the state, observe the world through the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this.

[Note in original: *State* was originally written as *guo* (國), but Han scholars altered it to *bang* (邦) to avoid the taboo on Emperor Gao’s name, disrupting the rhyme. Here, we follow the *Hanfeizi* version.]

Su’s Annotation: Has the world ever seen one who builds yet cannot be uprooted, or embraces yet cannot be torn away? Only the sage knows the truth of human nature and discerns the essence of things, relinquishing externals to cultivate the self. His virtue is fully accumulated, yet nothing is established, yet his building cannot be uprooted; nothing is grasped, yet his embrace cannot be torn away. Thus, even to his descendants, sacrifices never cease. Having cultivated the self, he extends its surplus outward, and even governing the world is possible. What lies beyond heaven and earth is unseen by the vulgar, yet its principle can be inferred by extension.

The ultimate cultivation of the self: observe the self through the self, observe the family through the family, observe the village through the village, observe the state through the state—all these are within my ken. But how do I know the sage observes the world through the world as I observe the self through the self? Is the self alone to be observed through the self, while the world cannot be observed through the world? Thus it is said: How do I know the world is thus? By this—meaning, by observing it through the self.

Lü’s Annotation: All things built will be uprooted; only those who follow the Dao build with constancy and nothingness, thus building well and remaining unshaken. All things embraced will slip away; only those who follow the Dao embrace the spirit with stillness, thus embracing well and remaining inseparable. Only when what is built and embraced is thus will its transmission never end—hence the descendants’ unceasing sacrifices.

The world’s so-called cultivation of virtue sometimes occurs in the state or the world, yet the true root lies in the self. Thus it is said: Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true. Some cultivate it in the self yet cannot extend it to the state or the world, thus: Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue overflows; cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue endures; cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue abounds; cultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.

Zhuangzi held that the Dao’s primary use is in governing the self, its surplus in governing the state, and its dregs in governing the world—this saying originates here. But how does one observe and cultivate the self? By observing the self through the self. What does it mean to observe the self through the self? When I examine what my self possesses, from whence does it arise? Then I know the origin of my self’s existence. Further, when I examine how my self observes, from whence does this observation arise? Then I know the origin of my observation. Having known the origin of my self’s existence and the origin of my observation, what is needed to cultivate the self is already sufficient, requiring nothing external. Observing the family through the family, the state through the state, the world through the world—all are like this. The ancients’ way of storing the world within the world relied on this Dao.

One whose virtue is profoundly thick is like an infant: poisonous insects do not sting it, fierce beasts do not seize it, birds of prey do not strike it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grasp is firm. It knows not the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of essence. It cries all day yet does not grow hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony. To know harmony is called constancy; to know constancy is called clarity. To augment life is called auspicious; to force qi with the heart is called strength. When things grow strong, they age—this is called not-Dao. What is not-Dao perishes early.

[Annotations in original: *Poisonous insects*—bees, scorpions, and the like—sting with their tails. *Fierce beasts*—tigers, leopards, and the like—seize with their claws. *Birds of prey*—eagles, ospreys, and the like—strike with their talons. Zhao Zhijian says: "To grasp with four fingers and the thumb is called a firm grasp." *Fang* (防): the male organ. *Hao*: level tone. *Sha* (嗄): hoarse voice. Another version reads *ai* (嗌), meaning "not hoarse." Huang Maocai says: "Ancient texts lacked the character *ai*; it was added later to *Zhuangzi*’s text." *Xiang* (祥): originally meaning "auspicious or inauspicious omens."]

Su’s Annotation: Laozi often compares the Dao to an infant, but this refers only to its essence, not its function.

The infant lies in perfect stillness, free of desire—its essence is thus complete. Yet when things approach, it does not know how to respond, so one cannot yet speak of its function. The Dao has no form or body; nothing can perceive it—how much less can it be harmed? That which causes humans to assume form is the presence of the heart-mind. Thus, where there is heart-mind, there is form; where there is form, there is opposition; and where there is opposition, harm inevitably follows. Beings without heart-mind have no adversary—how then could they be harmed? The reason the infant reaches this state is precisely because it is without heart-mind. It grasps without clinging, acts without desire—thus we know its essence is full, yet this is not due to the heart-mind. When the heart-mind moves, qi is harmed; when qi is harmed, the voice becomes hoarse. Yet the infant cries all day without hoarseness—thus we know its heart-mind does not move and its qi is harmonious. Harmony means that nothing external can harm what is within.

"Returning to the mandate" is called constancy—when encountering things, one knows to return to the root. "Knowing harmony" is called constancy—one attains the root and thereby responds to the myriad things. In truth, these are one and the same Dao. Thus both are called constancy. Life cannot be augmented; to attempt to augment it is to depart from its true nature. Qi detests forced action, and if one further employs the heart-mind to direct it, this is extreme rigidity. To augment life and compel qi to act against its nature is to daily grow more hardened, and old age will follow—thus one loses the infant’s inherent nature.

Lu’s Annotation: At the beginning of human life, one’s virtue and nature are most abundant. As one grows, the ears...

The eyes engage with externals, the heart-mind’s perceptions are received within—thus the daily increase of life’s desires grows ever more abundant, and what was once profound becomes shallow. Those who practice the Dao reduce what life augments; cultivating their nature, they return to virtue, and when virtue reaches its fullness, it becomes one with their beginning. Thus it is said: "Those who contain profound virtue are comparable to the infant."

The infant, as a creature, is distinguished solely by its reception of harmonious qi, accumulated yet undispersed. Poisonous insects do not sting it, fierce beasts do not seize it, and predatory birds do not strike it. How much more so for one who preserves the purity of qi, whose attainment extends to the very source of all things, and whose harmony is in great accord with them—who could harm such a one? This is like the query of Marquis Wen of Wei to Bu Shang.

For only essence can attain harmony. How so? Consider the infant: unaware of what it grasps, it clenches its fist tightly; unaware of what it gives, it stirs in resistance—this is essence. If the infant possessed even the slightest awareness of taking or giving, it would no longer be unified, and its nature would coarsen. Could it then remain as it is? Thus it is said: "Though its bones are weak and its sinews soft, its grip is firm. Unaware of the union of male and female, its organ stirs—such is the perfection of essence." Without care or vexation, though it cries all day, its throat does not grow hoarse—this is harmony. If the infant were troubled or vexed, its qi would turn perverse and lose harmony. Could it then remain as it is? Thus it is said: "Though it cries all day, its throat does not grow hoarse—this is the perfection of harmony."

When form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Essence refined to the utmost returns to unite with Heaven. When essence is thus united with Heaven, the fullness of harmonious qi and its accord with all things is no wonder. Therefore, to reach the ultimate of the Dao is to return to the mandate; to return to the mandate is called constancy. To contain profound virtue is to attain harmony; to know harmony is also called constancy. Though Dao and virtue may differ, in their convergence with constancy, they are the same.

To know constancy is to follow nature’s spontaneity without augmenting life, to act without knowing one’s actions, to proceed without knowing one’s direction. The body becomes like a withered branch, the heart-mind like dead ashes—how then could one employ the heart-mind to direct qi? Thus, to augment life is to invite omens; without omens, there are no human calamities. Omens are the harbingers of fortune and misfortune, and human calamities follow in their wake. To employ the heart-mind to direct qi is to invite force; those who are forceful belong to the ranks of the dead.

To attain emptiness and preserve softness—this is the Dao. The Dao endures, and one who embodies it does not perish. To attain fullness and forcefulness is to become an object; as objects grow strong, they age—this is not the Dao. Thus it is said: "When things grow strong, they age—this is called not following the Dao. Not following the Dao, they perish early."

Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Block the apertures, close the gates, blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, soften the glare, merge with the dust—this is called mysterious sameness. It cannot be made close, nor kept distant; it cannot be profited from, nor harmed; it cannot be valued, nor debased. Thus it is honored under Heaven.

Su’s Annotation: The Dao is not a matter of words, nor is it separate from them. Yet those who know may not speak, and those who speak may not know. Only by blocking the apertures and closing the gates to shut out externals, by blunting sharpness, untangling knots, softening glare, and merging with dust to order the internal—only then, in silent non-action, does one become one with the Dao. If it could be made close, it could also be kept distant; if it could be profited from, it could also be harmed; if it could be valued, it could also be debased. One who embodies the Dao covers all things equally—who then is close or distant? Viewing adversity and favor as the same—who then is profited or harmed? Unaware of honor or disgrace—who then is valued or debased? Where human calculations fall short, this is why it is honored under Heaven.

Lu’s Annotation: To know constancy is the perfection of knowledge. When knowledge reaches its perfection, one remains silent and accomplishes all without disorder.

Where then could the heart find lodging? If one cannot remain wordless, one cannot be without self—even if one knows, this is not true knowledge. Thus it is said: "The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know." Seal the senses, close the gates, blunt sharpness, untangle knots, soften glare, and merge with dust—this is called profound union. In such union, silence accomplishes all, and this is the Way.

Those who attain this see the ten thousand things as one storehouse, death and life as the same form. Nothing is excessively close, nothing excessively distant—thus they cannot be made close or kept distant. They neither pursue profit nor oppose harm—thus they cannot be profited from or harmed. They neither glory in success nor shame in adversity—thus they cannot be valued or debased.

For those who *can* be made close or distant, profited from or harmed, valued or debased, honor lies in external things, and things can debase them. For those who *cannot* be made close or distant, profited from or harmed, valued or debased, honor lies within themselves, and external things cannot debase them. Is it not fitting that they are honored under Heaven?

Yet those who know the Dao fundamentally never speak. Thus it is said: "To speak of the Dao with words is to speak of what is not the Dao." And those who know would take speech as knowledge—this is to know knowledge. This is why words cannot but emerge. Yet since these words arise from wordlessness, though spoken, they are as if unspoken.

How could the Dao be mere silence?

The *Bixu* Commentary states:
Master Junping said: The five flavors are on the tongue, the five tones in the ear—what is sweet is not truly sweet, what is bitter is not truly bitter, what is *shang* is not truly *shang*, what is *yu* is not truly *yu*. Yet Yi Ya and Shi Kuang could distinguish them. What enabled them to do so? The mouth cannot speak of it. If even flavors and sounds are thus, how much more so the wondrous Dao? This is why it is said: "Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know." Blocking the senses and shutting the gates was already discussed in Chapter Fifty-Two. Yet there, the focus was on the purity of the Dao to restrain the beginnings of desire and delight, while here, the emphasis is on the Dao’s wordlessness, giving rise to the discourse on diminishing hearing and discarding sight. The Dao is formless—it cannot be seen with the eyes or transmitted through the mouth. Thus the heart is confounded and cannot know, the mouth opens and cannot discuss. The perfected person, however, does not need to withdraw their gaze or seal their lips to naturally block the senses and shut the gates. Blunting sharpness, resolving entanglements, harmonizing light, and merging with dust were already addressed in Chapter Four. Yet there, the discussion centered on the Dao’s efficacy, while here, it clarifies the conduct of the person. When the perfected person shares the mind of Heaven, they are without knowledge; when they share the body of the Dao, they are without form. Then where could the mind of sharpness and entanglement arise? Where could the intent of light and dust distinctions emerge? Thus, in their movements and dwellings, when manifest, they share the same root as the myriad things; when hidden, they merge their origin with emptiness and nothingness. Speech and silence follow the moment without distinction, and their words, like the *zhi*-vessel, emerge daily to respond to change. This is why they are called "mysteriously identical."

The *Yuanze* Commentary states:
"Not speaking" does not mean secrecy or refusal to speak—it is truly that there is nothing to be spoken of. Why? Because they do not perceive a single dharma. Not perceiving a single dharma, they regard things as things yet are not objectified by things. How then could they be made close or distant, valued or debased? Those who *can* be made close or distant, valued or debased are merely things. But those who regard things as things yet are not objectified by things—though they may hold the rank of Ji, they remain eternally noble.

The *Xizhai* Commentary states:
All that exists in the world is but a dream’s realm. Thus, those who know do not speak, for speech cannot exhaust knowing. The deluded of the world take dreams as reality, clamoring and reciting without ever leaving the dream. Thus, their speech does not know, for their perception has not yet arrived. "Block the senses"—guard what emerges. "Shut the gates"—restrict what enters.

To blunt their sharpness is to govern their inner realm; to untangle their entanglements is to order their outer world. To harmonize their radiance is to restrain what lies within; to blend with their dust is to follow what lies without. Without going out or coming in, without inner or outer, without self or things—this is called *xuantong* (Mysterious Sameness). Having attained this sameness, to call it "close" is yet distant; to call it "distant" is yet near. To call it "benefit" brings no joy; to call it "harm" brings no fear. To call it "noble" does not elevate; to call it "base" does not debase. No mere thing can name it, and thus it becomes the most noble under heaven.

Govern the state with uprightness, employ the army with stratagem, and win the world through non-interference. How do I know this is so with the world? The more taboos in the world, the poorer the people grow. The more sharp instruments the people possess, the more benighted the state becomes. The more cunning and skill the people have, the more strange things arise. The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear. Therefore the sage declares: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves. I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves. I engage in no affairs, and the people prosper themselves. I am without desire, and the people simplify themselves.

Su’s Commentary:
The sages of antiquity were gentle with the distant and kind to the near, never intending to resort to arms. Only when unavoidable did they undertake punitive expeditions. Thus, governing the state was deemed upright, while employing the army was deemed stratagem. Yet even this was insufficient to win the world, for the world is a sacred vessel—one cannot act upon it. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Only those who embody the Dao remain vast and free from affairs. Though they do not seek to win the world, the world turns to them. When rulers impose many taboos, the sentiments of the people fail to reach above, leaving them impoverished and without recourse. Sharp instruments are but schemes and stratagems; when a wise ruler is above, the people are kept without knowledge or desire. If the people abound in schemes, their superiors grow benighted and confused. When people neglect fundamental work and pursue frivolous skills, strange and useless things proliferate. Fearing the people’s deceit, rulers multiply laws to suppress them, leaving the people with no place to set their hands and feet, driving them daily into banditry.

Lü’s Commentary:
The demeanor of the state does not enter the army; the demeanor of the army does not enter the state—this has been so for a long time. Thus, the means by which one governs the state and employs the army are fundamentally different. Governing the state cannot but be constant and enduring, hence it is done with uprightness, not stratagem. Uprightness is what makes it constant and enduring. Arms are inauspicious tools, not the instruments of the noble person. Therefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell in them. Yet if one must dwell in them for the sake of constancy and endurance, then it is done with stratagem, not uprightness. Stratagem responds to momentary changes. Because it employs stratagem, it cannot but act; because it employs uprightness, it does not govern the state with cleverness. Governing the state without relying on cleverness is the state’s blessing. That governing the state with affairs cannot win the world is evident. Thus it is said: govern the state with uprightness, employ the army with stratagem, and win the world through non-interference. How do I know that non-interference suffices to win the world? By knowing that interference does not suffice. If one’s actions do not arise from non-action but lead to interference, then the world abounds in taboos to avoid what is detested, causing many to lose their livelihoods and the people to grow poorer. When people possess many sharp instruments to pursue their desires, the lower ranks become inscrutable and the state grows more benighted. As the people grow poorer and more cunning, and the state more benighted, strange things proliferate. This is why laws and decrees multiply while thieves and bandits abound. Laws restrain where they are applied but cannot restrain where they are not. Decrees are obeyed where they are heeded but cannot be obeyed where they are not. When the people are poor and cunning, decrees go unheeded; when the state is benighted and strange things arise, laws fail to apply. This is why laws and decrees multiply while thieves and bandits abound. All this is the fault of seeking to win the world through interference. Therefore the sage declares: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves. I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves. I engage in no affairs, and the people prosper themselves. I am without desire, and the people simplify themselves. This is the proof that winning the world always arises from non-interference. The loss of the world stems from interference, which leads to many taboos and impoverished people, many sharp instruments and benighted states. Only thus do people grow cunning, strange things proliferate, laws and decrees multiply, and thieves and bandits abound. The return to order stems from non-action. Through non-action, the people transform themselves, abandoning cunning and forsaking profit, so that strange things do not arise. Through cherishing stillness, the people rectify themselves, and thieves and bandits vanish. From non-action and stillness come no affairs and no desires. With no affairs, the people prosper themselves and poverty from taboos ceases. With no desires, the people simplify themselves, and the benightedness from sharp instruments fades. Such is the natural order.

Xizhai’s Commentary:
I govern with uprightness, following the people’s inherent rectitude.

Governing through the extraordinary in warfare stems from warfare’s inherent extraordinariness. Taking the world through non-action stems from the world’s inherent non-action. In all my responses to things, is it truly by my doing? It is merely by things themselves. The sages of antiquity, who could regard the world as one body and the central states as one person, governed from their own hearts. If I impose many taboos, prohibitions must be set; once prohibitions are set, how can the people avoid poverty? If I display profit to the people, the people will rush toward profit; once the people rush toward profit, how can the state avoid benightedness? If I display cunning to the people, the people will multiply their skills; once skills prevail, how can strange things fail to proliferate? If I govern the people by laws, the people will also steal the laws for their own convenience; when superiors and inferiors deceive one another, how can thieves and bandits fail to abound?

The sage displays non-action, displays stillness, displays non-affairs, displays non-desire. The world responds to what is displayed to it. Thus it is said: virtue is like the wind, the people are like the grass—the wind over the grass must bend it.

His governance is unhurried, and his people are honest; his governance is exacting, and his people are deficient. Disaster!—fortune leans upon it; fortune!—disaster lurks within it. Who knows its limit? With no constant standard, right reverts to the extraordinary, good reverts to the ominous. The people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.

Thus the sage is square but does not cut, has edges but does not wound, is straight but does not extend, is bright but does not dazzle.

Yet how often does fortune turn to misfortune, right to the extraordinary, good to the ominous—who can say which prevails? All this does is multiply cunning and make governance difficult, leaving nothing whole in its simplicity. Why is this so? For time has its endings and beginnings, the world its transformations; fortune and misfortune, though pure in their coming, may bring what jars or what accords. What jars is called misfortune by the world, yet if it accords, it leans toward fortune. What accords is called fortune by the world, yet if it jars, misfortune lurks within. Who then can know its limit and evade or embrace it?

From the moment one pursues the singular, what is called "right" may deviate, and what is deemed "right" may in truth be unknown. What is right today may become extraordinary tomorrow; what is extraordinary here may be right there. The same holds for good and ominous. Thus fortune and misfortune, right and the extraordinary, good and ominous in the world cannot be fixed. Since the people first gained knowledge, they have clung to delusion—how long it has endured! How can one burden them further with exacting governance and prevent them from returning to simplicity and wholeness?

Therefore, the sage is square but does not cut, so he does not impose a single judgment to benefit the world; he is sharp but does not wound, so he overcomes things without harm; he is straight but does not extend, so he can bend to preserve the crooked and straighten the bent; he is bright but does not dazzle, so he employs his light and returns to his clarity. This is nothing other than embracing the unhurried and rejecting the exacting.

In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. Only through frugality can one attain early compliance; early compliance is called the accumulation of virtue. With virtue amassed, nothing is unconquerable; with nothing unconquerable, none can fathom its limit. Fathoming no limit, one may possess a state and its generative power, and thus endure long. This is the Dao of deep roots, firm foundation, long life, and enduring vision.

Thus it is said: in governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. Only through frugality can one preserve their spirit without expending it, thereby attaining early restoration. If one is not frugal and squanders it, exhausting spirit and fatiguing essence, even if one wishes to return to their spirit, there will be no path to enter. In such restoration, is it not too late? Therefore, it is said: only through frugality can one attain early restoration. The life of a person is fundamentally sufficient in virtue. If one is truly frugal and restores early, virtue will daily increase and fill. Thus it is said: early restoration is called the accumulation of virtue. With virtue amassed, it reaches its utmost. One of utmost virtue cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, nor destroyed by birds or beasts—where then can one not prevail? Therefore, it is said: with virtue amassed, nothing is unconquerable. If there is something unconquerable, the Dao has its limit. With nothing unconquerable, who can fathom its limit? Thus it is said: with nothing unconquerable, none can know its limit.

One who possesses land possesses great things. One who possesses great things cannot be objectified by things yet can objectify all things. None knowing its limit, it is not objectified yet can objectify all things. Though possessing land, it is without burden. Thus it is said: none knowing its limit, one may possess a state. Having grasped the mother, one knows the child; knowing the child, one returns to guard the mother, and thus to the end of life does not peril. Therefore, it is said: possessing the mother of the state, one may endure long. Thus frugality as Dao is called the Way of deep roots and firm foundation, of long life and enduring vision.

Spirit is the root of life; frugality preserves it, and thus the root deepens and life endures. Long life is the foundation of vision; guarding and protecting it, the foundation is firm and vision endures.

Xi Zhai’s commentary:
In governing people outwardly and serving Heaven inwardly, nothing surpasses frugality. Frugality means nothing is not preserved—cautious within, restrained without, the inner heart not scattered, the outer heart not stirred. Thus one attains early compliance: inwardly, the heart complies; outwardly, the form complies. Still and unmoving, virtue has where to accumulate. Accumulating what does not accumulate, nothing is not overcome; with nothing unconquerable, nothing is ungoverned. Though possessing a state, it is possible. People know one may possess a state but do not know that possessing a state arises from having a root. When the root is deeply amassed, even its dust, chaff, and husks may be molded into Yao and Shun—how much more those below? This is what is called deep roots and firm foundation, the Way of governing people and serving Heaven.

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish: with the Dao, one oversees the world, and its *gui* do not act as spirits. It is not that its *gui* do not act as spirits, but that their spirit does not harm people. It is not that their spirit does not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm them. When the two do not harm one another, virtue and power converge and return.

*(Variant: "the sage also does not harm people" follows "virtue and power converge and return." The meaning refers to the spirit.)*

Han Fei’s explanation:
If a craftsman frequently changes his work, he loses his achievement; if a laborer frequently shifts his task, he loses his accomplishment. One person’s work, if half a day is lost daily, in ten days loses five days’ work. Ten thousand people’s work, if half a day is lost daily, in ten days loses fifty thousand days’ work. Thus, those who frequently change their work multiply their losses, and the deficit grows ever greater.

Whenever laws and orders are altered, advantages and harms shift; when advantages and harms shift, the people’s tasks change—this is called changing work. Thus, observing by principle: managing a great multitude and frequently disturbing them yields little success. Storing great vessels and frequently moving them incurs many losses. Cooking a small fish and frequently stirring it spoils its luster. Governing a great state and frequently changing laws wearies the people. Therefore, a ruler of the Dao values stillness and does not esteem changing laws. Thus it is said: governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.

When people suffer illness, they value tranquility; when misfortune strikes, they fear *gui*. When the sage is above, the people have few desires. With few desires, their blood and qi are ordered, and their actions are reasonable. With reasonable actions, they suffer few misfortunes. Free from internal sores, ulcers, and hemorrhoids, and external punishments and executions, their *gui* are light and calm. Thus it is said: with the Dao, one oversees the world, and its *gui* do not act as spirits.

When the people of a well-governed age do not contend with *gui* spirits, it is said: it is not that its *gui* do not harm people.

The spirits do not harm people—this is called *gui* afflictions. When people suffer illness, it is called *gui* harming people; when people drive them away, it is called people harming *gui*. When the people violate laws and decrees, it is called the people harming their ruler; when the ruler executes punishments upon the people, it is called the ruler harming the people. If the people do not violate the law, the ruler likewise does not carry out punishments—this is called the ruler not harming the people. Thus it is said: the sage also does not harm the people. When the ruler does not harm the people and the people do not harm the *gui*, it is said: the two do not harm each other.

When the people do not violate the law, the ruler internally does not employ punishments and externally does not pursue profit from their livelihood. When the ruler internally does not employ punishments and externally does not pursue profit from their livelihood, the people multiply and prosper. When the people multiply and prosper, their stores and accumulations flourish—this is called possessing virtue. All so-called afflictions arise from obstructing and scattering the spirit; when the spirit is scattered, one lacks virtue. When *gui* do not afflict people, the obstructions are not removed; when obstructions are not removed, the spirit is not scattered—this is called possessing virtue. When the ruler’s stores and accumulations flourish and the *gui* do not scatter the people’s spirit, then virtue resides entirely among the people. Thus it is said: when the two do not harm each other, virtue is mutually returned. This means that virtue, flourishing above and below, is wholly returned to the people.

**Su’s Annotation:**
One must not stir when cooking a small fish; one must not trouble when governing a great state. If troubled, the people labor; if stirred, the fish falls apart. The sage practices non-action, allowing each to rest in their natural state. Externally, there is nothing to trouble them; internally, there is nothing to fear—thus nothing can invade. Even *gui* have no use for their numinous power. It is not that the *gui* lack numinosity, but that though numinous, they do not harm people. It is not that the numinous does not harm people, but that the sage has never harmed people, so the *gui* have no power to act. The reason people and *gui* do not harm each other lies in the presence of the sage above—thus virtue is mutually returned.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
To govern a state by obtaining the Mother of the state is not difficult, even for a great state. One who cooks fish must not trouble it, and one who cooks a small fish must especially preserve it whole without cutting. Governing a great state is likewise. If one cooks and cuts it, one harms it. Ruling the world with the Dao is called great governance—one likewise does not cut to harm it. When it reaches its utmost, its *gui* do not act as spirits. This is all achieved through non-harm.

Why say so? The nature of *gui* is not without numinosity. When they mingle with people and display their numinosity, they cannot but harm people. That they do not act as spirits is because the sage is able to rule the world with the Dao, preventing people from indulging their natures or altering their virtue, without great joy or anger to disrupt the harmony of yin and yang—this is what is meant by dwelling in the midst of the turbid world and attaining tranquility with the age. Thus the sage also does not harm people. Only the sage can refrain from harming people, so yin and yang are harmonious and still, *gui*-spirits are not disturbed, the myriad things are unharmed, and all living beings do not meet premature death—thus their spirits do not harm people. If spirits do not harm people, they have no way to display their numinous resonance, and so they do not act as spirits.

From this perspective, that the *gui* do not act as spirits is not because they lack numinosity, but because their numinosity does not harm people—thus they do not act as spirits. It is not that their numinosity does not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm people—thus their numinosity does not harm people. If the sage cannot preserve the people’s simplicity and harms them, causing them to lose their nature, so that the four seasons do not arrive and the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved, then the people’s harm to the spirits will be great—how could the spirits not harm people? Only when spirits do not harm people do they return virtue to the people; when spirits do not harm people, the people also return virtue to the spirits. Thus it is said: when the two do not harm each other, virtue is mutually returned.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
Governing the state is but a minor task for the sage, no more than cooking a small fish. Though the Dao encompasses the vast, the strange, the cunning, and the marvelous, all are united as one—thus its *gui* do not act as spirits. It is not that the *gui* lack numinosity; if *gui* possessed numinosity, all the vast, strange, cunning, and marvelous would be transformed into the Dao. How could the Dao harm people? The original intent was that we do not harm people, so even in the hidden depths, *gui*-spirits cannot use their numinosity to harm beings. In great governance and hidden spirits, the two do not harm each other—thus the hearts of people and *gui* are mutually returned. Without utmost virtue, how could this be achieved?

**Cheng Ju’s Discourse:**
That the sage does not harm the people is certain, but how can they also cause *gui*-spirits not to harm people? The relation of people within the Dao and the Dao within people is like that of fish in water and water in fish—what distinction is there between life and death? When the Dao rules the world, the people’s lives are tranquil, and so they nurture their lives well; their deaths are serene, and so they nurture their deaths well. Serene and still, how can *gui* act as spirits? Living thus, dying thus—how could there be numinous resonance, afflictions, or calamities?

**Hongfu’s Annotation:**
Stirring a small fish while cooking causes it to fall apart, so the sage governs the world with non-action. Though there may be numinous treachery, it has no use—it is not that the sage can eliminate it to prevent it from acting as spirits. Though numinous, it cannot harm people. Why? Because the sage has never harmed people. If the sage does not harm people, spirits also cannot harm people—this is the two not harming each other. Without harm, virtue is returned. Is there some separate virtue in non-harm? Virtue is already present in harm.

A great state is the lower reaches where all under heaven converge; it is the female of all under heaven. The female always overcomes the male with stillness, always placing itself below. Thus when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it gains the small state; when a small state humbles itself before a great state, it gains the great state. Therefore, some humble themselves to gain, and some humble themselves and gain. A great state desires only to nurture and embrace others; a small state desires only to serve and join others. When both obtain what they desire, the greater should humble itself.

**Su’s Annotation:**
All under heaven turn to a great state as all waters flow to the lower reaches. All movement rushes toward stillness as all heights descend to the low. If a great state is humble, small states will attach to it; if a small state is humble, a great state will receive it. A great state humbles itself to gain people; a small state humbles itself to be gained by others.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Knowing how to govern one’s state with the Dao, one certainly does not harm its people. But if one does not know how to engage with all under heaven, though one does not harm people, there will still be those who harm its people. A great state is the lower reaches where all under heaven converge; the convergence of all under heaven is the female. The female always overcomes the male with stillness, always placing itself below—this is the way to engage with all under heaven and preserve its people.

For the convergence of all under heaven is the female, and the female always overcomes the male with stillness—this overcoming arises precisely from placing itself below. If a great state truly abides in the lower reaches to attract the convergence of all under heaven, this is the way of the female: by stillness and humility, it overcomes the male. Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it gains the small state—this is what is meant by "sometimes lowering oneself to gain." "Lowering oneself to gain" means that the great, in relation to the small, ought to humble itself as if it could do otherwise, yet chooses to lower itself to gain. When a small state humbles itself before a great state, it gains the great state—this is what is meant by "sometimes lowering oneself and being gained." "Lowering oneself and being gained" means that the small, in relation to the great, has no choice but to humble itself to be gained.

Now, a great state does not merely desire to annex and nurture others, nor does a small state merely desire to enter into service. If the great lowers itself to the small, and the small in turn lowers itself to the great, each attains what it desires—how could there be any who do not gain? "Gaining" here means winning their hearts without losing them. Yet if both great and small must humble themselves, why does the text say only that "the great ought to humble itself"? If the small cannot humble itself before the great, it not only fails to gain the great state but also invites disaster—thus, there is no question of its being inappropriate. Therefore, the text says only that "the great ought to humble itself."

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
If a state is great yet can descend to seek others, others will surely converge and submit to it. The female, through stillness and humility, always overcomes the male. Thus, if a great state humbles itself before a small state, it will surely gain the small state; if a small state humbles itself before a great state, it will surely gain the great state. "Sometimes a great state lowers itself to gain a small state, or lowers itself to be gained by a great state"—this means each wins the other’s heart. Therefore, a great state desires only to nurture small states, while a small state desires only to serve a great state. Only thus do both attain what they seek. Mencius said: "He who with a small state serves a large one is one who stands in awe of Heaven; he who with a large state serves a small one is one who rejoices in Heaven. He who rejoices in Heaven will preserve all under heaven; he who stands in awe of Heaven will preserve his state." Thus, a great state must especially humble itself.

**Wu’s Annotation:**
"Convergence" means a gathering place. A great state is the gathering place of all small states, just as the lower reaches of a river are the gathering place of all waters. The female does not move first to seek the male; the male always moves first to seek the female. Those who move to seek invite loss, while those who wait in stillness receive benefit—hence it is said, "with stillness it overcomes the male." Those who move to seek stand above; those who wait in stillness stand below—hence it is said, "with stillness it places itself below." Some say the character "female" may be superfluous. A great state, without relying on its loftiness, humbly lowers itself to small states and thus secures their willing attachment. A small state, willingly abiding in lowliness, humbly submits to a great state and thus gains its acceptance. "Lowering oneself to gain" means a great state humbles itself to win the attachment of small states; "lowering oneself and being gained" means a small state humbles itself to gain the acceptance of a great state. When a great state lowers itself to a small state, it desires only to nurture the small state; when a small state lowers itself to a great state, it desires only to enter into its service. If both can humble themselves, great and small each attain what they desire. Yet the small, being naturally beneath others, need not fear inability to humble itself; the great, not being naturally beneath others, may fear it cannot lower itself. Therefore, the text says, "the great ought to humble itself." The opening metaphor of the lower reaches illustrates that a great state, though not naturally beneath others, can lower itself; the metaphor of the female and male illustrates that a small state, being naturally beneath others, can lower itself.

**Lin Xi-yi’s Annotation:**
A great state desires only to annex and nurture others; a small state desires only to enter into service—neither can do so without humbling itself. Only by humbling itself can each attain its desire. Thus, those who know the Dao must always regard humility as proper. This sentence concludes the chapter. Its meaning is simply that the strong must be able to be weak, and the possessing must be able to be without—this is the consistent intent of the *Dao De Jing*. Many interpreters take its metaphors as literal statements and thus miss the point. Only Huang Maocai said: "This entire chapter borrows things to clarify the Dao"—this is most apt, though he did not extend this insight to other chapters.

The Dao is the innermost recess of the myriad things, the treasure of the good, and the refuge of the not-good. Beautiful words can be traded for esteem; noble conduct can be elevated above others. Why should one abandon those who are not good? Thus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, though one may offer large jade disks followed by teams of four horses, it is not as good as presenting this Dao.

**Su’s Annotation:**
All things manifest externally are but their gateways and halls. The Dao within things is like their innermost recess—all things possess it, yet people do not see it. Only the worthy attain and hold it, hence it is called "the treasure of the good." The foolish, though unable to possess it, cannot be at peace without it—hence it is called "the refuge of the not-good." The Dao is not far from people, yet people distance themselves from it. If one truly speaks beautiful words, they can be traded for worldly esteem; if one practices noble conduct, it can be elevated above others. If one who was unjust in the morning hears the great Dao by evening, delusion vanishes and nature is restored—how could one then point to their former ungoodness? And how could one abandon them? In establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, the aim is to save people with the Dao. Though one may offer the finest jade and the finest horses, presenting them is not as valuable as presenting this Dao. The Dao is inherently within us—people need only seek it to attain it. The Dao is beyond merit or fault—people need only know it, and no fault can stain them.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
All things embrace yin and enfold yang, blending qi to achieve harmony—there is not a single thing that does not fully possess the Dao. A room has its innermost recess, a deep and tranquil place where the honored reside. All things have such a deep, tranquil, and honored place—this is the Dao. Hence it is said: "The Dao is the innermost recess of the myriad things." Precisely because of this, it is the treasure of the good and the refuge of the not-good. Why? The good know the source of their goodness and thus attain it as an inexhaustible, priceless wealth—is this not their treasure? The not-good know that their ungoodness, when brought to this point, becomes utterly dissolved—even with myriad evils, they vanish without a trace.

Is this not their refuge? Fine words may earn marketable esteem, and noble conduct may impose authority upon others—yet whether good or not, all people inherently recognize what is fine and revere what is noble. The one who embodies the Dao, however, stands to others as heaven and earth: heaven covers all without exception, earth bears all without omission—far beyond the reach of fine words or noble conduct. Then how could the not-good be cast aside? Thus, when establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, though they may offer clasped jades before four-horse carriages as tribute to their superiors—reverent in ritual, weighty in gifts—it is not equal to simply presenting this Dao. For the value of the Dao in the world surpasses even such reverence and lavish tribute. The Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes sit in deliberation for no other purpose than this.

Why has this Dao been prized since antiquity? Is it not said: "Seek it and attain; bear guilt and be absolved"? To seek and attain is the treasure of the good; to bear guilt and be absolved is the refuge of the not-good. Precisely for this reason, it is the most precious thing under heaven, and since antiquity, it could not but be held in the highest esteem.

息斋’s Annotation:
The profound (奧) means "to conceal." The Dao is prized by all things, just as the innermost chamber (奧) can conceal them. The worthy treasure the Dao, thus delighting in attaining what they seek; the unworthy have no refuge but the Dao, thus delighting in absolution from guilt. Since it is rooted in the naturalness of the human heart without external imposition, it is said: "Rely on the Dao, and its beauty may be traded; follow the Dao, and its honor may be conferred upon others." If not for the naturalness of the human heart, words would go unheeded, and actions would meet no response.

Since each person is rooted in the Dao, even those who unfortunately fall into unworthiness—how could the sage bear to abandon them? Thus, the establishment of the Son of Heaven and the appointment of the Three Dukes are not merely to indulge in their wealth and nobility. Rather, they do not wish to abandon people in unworthiness but instead use this Dao to guide them toward goodness. Even if one presents clasped jades before four-horse carriages, it is not equal to uttering a single good word or performing a single good deed, so that all under heaven may not lose their goodness. How slight would such a benefit be?

To awaken the people through the Dao is what is meant by "sitting and presenting this Dao." Why has this Dao been prized since antiquity? Because the good do not toil day and night to attain their goodness, and if the unfortunate should fall into unworthiness, it is still sufficient for them to free themselves from evil. How could this not be worthy of the world’s highest esteem?

Wu’s Annotation:
The "profound of all things" (萬物之奧) refers to what is most prized among them. The innermost chamber (奧) is the southwest corner of a hall, and in the design of ancestral temples, there are halls and inner chambers, with the chamber being the more honored. Within the chamber, the southeast corner is called *fang*, the northeast *xun*, the northwest *wulou*, and the southwest *ao*—the most honored place, where the esteemed reside. Thus, the honor of the Dao is like the innermost chamber of a temple hall. "Clasped jades" (拱璧) are jades held in both hands; "four-horse carriages" (驷马) are the horses of a single chariot. Presenting clasped jades before four-horse carriages is like the *Spring and Autumn Annals* saying, "leather first, twelve oxen after." In diplomatic audiences, the four-horse carriages are displayed outside, while the clasped jades are held to convey the message—this is called "presenting first." Though such tribute is the height of reverence, it is not truly prized. It is not equal to kneeling and presenting this Dao, which is the most honored of all.

Ye’s Annotation:
Even the ignorant among husband and wife, if they seek the Dao, will not fail to attain it. Once they hear it, even what they once deemed sinful can be entirely washed away. Thus, the value of the Dao truly lies here, not elsewhere.

Act without acting, attend without attending, savor the tasteless.
Great and small, much and little—repay resentment with virtue.
Resolve difficulties while they are easy; accomplish the great while it is small.
The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy;
The great affairs of the world must arise from the small.
Therefore, the sage never strives for greatness and thus achieves greatness.
One who makes light promises must lack trust;
One who treats many things as easy will encounter many difficulties.
Therefore, the sage treats things as difficult and thus never encounters difficulty.

Wu’s Annotation on the Passage:
"Act without acting" means to act in such a way that the act itself cannot be discerned, hence "acting without acting." "Attend without attending" means that when one acts without acting, affairs likewise become "without attending." Not only are affairs without attending, but even when one savors them, they are tasteless. To savor is to reflect and ponder repeatedly. The Dao as a thing cannot be seen, cannot be heard, and cannot be grasped. Though one may reflect and ponder repeatedly, it ultimately returns to nothingness.

Only thus can it be great or small, much or little. Whether much or little depends on me, and what is called resentment has no fixed nature. Thus, even the ungood, I deem good—virtue is goodness; even the untrustworthy, I deem trustworthy—virtue is trust. And I repay all with virtue.

What people find difficult to guard against is resentment, yet repaying it with virtue leaves nothing to burden the heart. Not only this, but one resolves difficulties while they are easy and accomplishes the great while it is small. The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy; the great affairs of the world must arise from the small. Yet I am always without action. If there is action, it must be seen in the easy and the small—this is what is meant by "knowing the subtle, it is divine."

If one can grasp this in the heart, then extending it to the world and the state presents no difficulty. Therefore, the sage never strives for greatness and thus achieves greatness—because he accomplishes the great while it is small, not striving for greatness when it is already great.

To make a promise is easy; to retract it is difficult. If one is not cautious when making promises, words become hard to retract. If one plans while things are easy, they remain easy; if one plans when things are difficult, they become difficult. If one does not plan at the outset when things are easy but waits until they are difficult, then they become truly difficult. This is why ordinary people lack trust and encounter many difficulties. Therefore, the sage treats things as difficult from the outset and thus never encounters difficulty—because he treats them as difficult while they are easy, not waiting until they are difficult.

息斋’s Annotation:
Act without acting, and one does not toil; attend without attending, and people are not troubled; savor the tasteless, and things are not wasted. What the world calls great and small, much and little refers to form. The sage roams beyond forms, thus great and small, much and little are equalized as one. If even great and small, much and little are equalized as one, how much more so for favor and resentment, repayment and bestowal?

What I do and bestow is only virtue—how would I know of resentment? How would I know of repayment? With no distinction between favor and resentment, repayment and bestowal, and no difference between great and small, much and little, how could there be any intention in the affairs of the world?

The affair must seek the easy; the great must proceed from the fine. Proceeding from the easy, even the difficult becomes easy; advancing from the fine, even the great becomes fine. Thus, the sage never acts great, yet the great inevitably returns to him—because he is without intention. Precisely because he is without intention in affairs, he never anticipates events or imposes expectations upon things. How could he be like the petty men of the world, who pledge before acting and change their minds when matters arise? Premature pledges必必必必 lead to broken trust; frequent changes必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必必 lead to many difficulties. The sage, when affairs have not yet arisen, always treats them as difficult—not that he truly deems them difficult, but because he does not impose his will upon things, he appears to regard them as such. Precisely because he treats them as difficult, they ultimately present no difficulty.

*Bishu*:
When affairs involve form, there is great and small; when bound to number, there is much and little—this is the origin of resentment. Only the Dao transcends form and number, and the sage unites with it, acting through non-action, engaging in affairs through non-affairs, savoring through tastelessness. Love and aversion vanish; the passions of sage and commoner are exhausted, and he abides serenely in the dwelling of emptiness. Then great and small, much and little are viewed as one—how could resentment or repayment arise? Only virtue encompasses them. Yet this non-action, non-affair, tastelessness cannot be attained by force—it is supremely easy, yet cannot be glimpsed by the eye—supremely fine. Though supremely easy, the supremely difficult is resolved through it; though supremely fine, the supremely great is accomplished through it. How could one neglect it for its easiness or fineness? Some learners of the Dao glimpse this truth yet are distracted by thoughts of greatness, so the easy and fine do not long remain theirs. Only the sage, from beginning to end, embodies non-action, non-affairs, tastelessness, and does not allow the world’s so-called greatness to divide his mind. Thus, when the difficult and great arise, he remains utterly still, without obstruction, and the great Dao is thereby preserved whole. This is what it means to "accomplish the great." Alas! This is not something those with the vision of great men, clear understanding of principles, and resolute minds can merely believe or uphold—how could it be shared with those who lightly pledge and frequently change?

Hold fast to what is tranquil and easy; plan for what has not yet shown signs; sever what is fragile when distinct; disperse what is subtle. Act before things arise; govern before disorder begins. A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tender shoot; a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth; a journey of a thousand li begins beneath one’s feet. Those who act fail; those who grasp lose. Thus, the sage practices non-action and does not fail; holds nothing and does not lose. People in their undertakings often fail when near completion. Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failed affairs. Therefore, the sage desires the undesired and does not value rare goods; learns the unlearned and reverses the errors of the multitude, relying on the spontaneity of the myriad things without daring to act.

Su’s Annotation:
When things have not yet arisen, holding fast and planning is sufficient. When they are about to manifest, one must dissolve and disperse them before they depart.

Yet this is still preferable to what has already come to pass. Thus, to act before things arise is supreme; to govern before disorder emerges is secondary. The tree, the terrace, the journey—all accumulate from the small to become great. The coming of order and chaos, fortune and misfortune, follows these same three patterns. The sage awaits them with non-action and guards them with non-grasping, thereby allowing fortune to arise of itself and misfortune to vanish of itself. It is like planting seedlings: deep plowing and careful tending ensure a bountiful autumn harvest. It is like facing a thief: sitting in vigilant stillness and gazing intently will make the thief retreat of his own accord. The world does not understand the spontaneity of things, believing that without action nothing is accomplished, without grasping nothing remains. Thus, they constantly contend with misfortune for victory and struggle to produce fortune, only to find misfortune beyond remedy and fortune beyond attainment. Such is the principle at work.

The sage knows the harm of forced action and does not use human effort to assist Heaven. From beginning to end, all follows its natural course, and so nothing fails to reach completion. The worldly, their minds set on gain, guard against even the slightest signs of trouble, yet may still fail to recognize them, allowing things to unfold naturally. But when they see success nearly within grasp, fearing its loss, none do not then attribute failure to this very neglect. Therefore, it is said: be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failed affairs.

People all pursue their desires to the detriment of things and trust their learning to the harm of principle. The sage is not without desire, yet desires the undesired—thus, though desiring, does not harm things. The sage is not without learning, yet learns the unlearned—thus, though learning, does not harm principle. Only then, with inner and outer clarity and vast emptiness, can one practice non-action, assist the spontaneity of the myriad things, and await their self-completion.

Lü’s Annotation:
What is at peace is easy to maintain; what is perilous and then maintained is difficult.

Those without signs are easy to plan for; once set in motion and then planned for, it becomes difficult. What is fragile is easy to break—one must not let it grow firm. What is subtle is easy to disperse—one must not let it become manifest. All things are thus, but the mind is most so. Mastering the mind enables one to manage the world and the state without difficulty.

To be at peace is to be without signs; thus, one acts before things arise. What is fragile and subtle is treated before disorder emerges. A tree of arm-span girth grows from a tiny sprout; greatness arises from the small. A nine-tiered terrace begins with heaped earth; height starts from below. A journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step; distance starts from what is near. Thus, acting before things arise and governing before disorder emerges—this is the constant principle of root and branch.

To act before things arise is to act through non-action. To govern before disorder emerges is to govern through non-governance. Once things have arisen and one acts, the act seeks completion but instead brings failure. Once disorder has set in and one governs, the governance seeks stability but instead incurs loss. Therefore, the sage acts before things arise, thus inherently practicing non-action—hence no failure. Governs before disorder emerges, thus inherently practicing non-attachment—hence no loss. The people, however, always act after things have arisen, and so nearly succeed only to fail, for they do not know the root. If they understood that greatness arises from the small, height from below, and distance from what is near, and were as cautious at the end as at the beginning, there would be no failed affairs.

Thus, the sage desires the undesired and does not prize rare, hard-to-obtain goods, thereby purifying desire in the俗 and striving to attain clarity—those who do not know this are not so. Learns the unlearned to redress the transgressions of the multitude, assisting the spontaneity of the myriad things without daring to act—those who seek to refine their nature through俗 learning to return to their origin do not know this.

Yuanze’s Annotation:
The desire for the undesired is not the absence of desire; the desire lies precisely in the undesired. Thus, the sage does not prize rare goods. What the sage calls non-action and non-attachment is not to the point of complete detachment but to refrain from generating anything beyond one’s inherent nature. Moreover, people must eat their fill and wear warm clothes—these are unavoidable desires. To desire these alone is not to depart from one’s nature; to further prize rare, hard-to-obtain goods is the folly of the deluded, who have long since lost their root. Therefore, the sage constantly desires the undesired to rescue the deluded and return them to their nature.

The learning of the unlearned is not the absence of learning; the learning lies precisely in the unlearned, to redress the transgressions of the multitude. The multitude pursues the trivial and busies itself with many things; the sage, through the learning of the unlearned, rescues their transgressions and returns them to the Dao, assisting spontaneity—what Zhuangzi calls "returning to assist Heaven." To act is to use the human to destroy the Heavenly. Therefore, one does not dare to act. Then the myriad things rest in the constancy of their nature and destiny, and things show no signs of arising. How could there be anything fragile to dissolve or subtle to disperse?

Xizhai’s Annotation:
The sage constantly abides in what is at peace, thus his peace is ever-peaceful. He holds without holding, hence it is called "easy to maintain." By not holding, he maintains his peace. If the slightest stirring of the mind arises, he plans for it before signs appear; if it is fragile, he breaks it before it grows firm; if it is subtle, he disperses it before it becomes manifest. Thus, nothing disturbs his peace. He maintains his peace before things arise and governs his mind before disorder emerges. It is like a tree of arm-span girth growing from a tiny sprout, a nine-tiered terrace rising from heaped earth, a journey of a thousand *li* beginning with a single step—within non-action, action arises naturally; within non-accumulation, accumulation occurs naturally. Day by day, goodness departs, and day by day, virtue accumulates, yet the sage remains unaware.

If one acts with intention, one brings failure; if one governs with attachment, one incurs loss. Because he practices non-action, there is no failure; because he practices non-attachment, there is no loss. The reason the world finds the Dao difficult to achieve and easy to ruin lies in its intentional action and attachment. At the outset, it seems there is no room for diligence, yet by the end, one cannot avoid slackening—all due to the fault of acting and attachment. If one does not act at the outset and does not attach, one cannot even find diligence, let alone slackening. This is why the world nearly succeeds only to fail.

Only the sage takes the undesired as desire, thus never prizing rare, hard-to-obtain goods. What is called "rare" need not be gold or jade; all things beyond the body are hard to obtain. The multitude transgresses with their eyes in color and their ears in sound. I take the unlearned as learning, reversing sight and hearing to redress the transgressions of the multitude, assisting the spontaneity of the Dao without daring to act. How could there be the affliction of acting and attachment?

Wu’s Annotation:
"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning" further develops the two instances of "end" in the preceding text: "ultimately without difficulty" and "ultimately not acting greatly." Though one may initially deem something difficult, by the end one no longer finds it so; though one may initially dare not consider something great, by the end one deems it so. Thus, affairs nearly completed may yet fail in the end. Therefore, one must be as cautious at the end as at the beginning. If one deems something difficult at the outset and continues to do so at the end, and does not deem something great at the outset nor at the end, then there will ultimately be no failed affairs.

Liu’s Annotation:
Desiring what the multitude does not desire is called "desiring the undesired." Not desiring what the multitude desires is called "not prizing rare, hard-to-obtain goods." Learning what the multitude does not learn is called "learning the unlearned." Not learning what the multitude learns is called "redressing the transgressions of the multitude."

Those of old who were adept in the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people but to make them simple. The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive knowledge. Thus, governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane; governing the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing. Knowing these two is also a model. To know the model is called "mysterious virtue." Mysterious virtue is profound, far-reaching, and contrary to things, yet ultimately attains great compliance.

Annotation:
"Model" and "standard" are terms of method. Below, "profound" means deep, "far-reaching" means encompassing, and "contrary" means opposed. "Ultimately attains compliance" means, as Sima explains, "Though the feelings of things all prize knowledge, those with mysterious virtue alone devalue it. Though contrary to things, they are compliant with the Dao."

Lü’s commentary: The multitude are bright and clear, while I alone seem dim; the common folk are sharp and discerning, while I alone am dull and muddled. My heart is that of a fool—ah! Those of old who were adept in the Dao were thus within themselves, and thus they extended it to the people: it was certainly not to make them sharp but to make them simple. "Sharp and discerning, bright and clear"—this is what is meant by making them sharp. "Dim and muddled"—this is what is meant by making them simple. The people lose their nature by dwelling in ornament and forsaking substance, so their knowledge multiplies and they become difficult to govern. If one truly wishes to govern them, one must dispel knowledge and habit, steadying them with the nameless uncarved block, so that they transform themselves. To govern them with knowledge is precisely what brings disorder. For to destroy the principle of "not knowing, not perceiving, and following the emperor’s rule" is to become a thief. Governing the state with knowledge destroys this principle.

Thus it is said: "Governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane; governing the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing." Knowing these two is not only a model for governing the state but also a standard for the self, one that is never transgressed. For to know the child and guard the mother, so that one’s body does not perish—this is the blessing of not governing with knowledge. To open its apertures and assist its affairs, so that one is never saved—this is the bane of governing with knowledge. Then is not "not governing with knowledge" as opposed to "governing with knowledge" also my standard? Truly knowing the standard and never transgressing its virtue—this may be called "mysterious."

When virtue reaches the mysterious, it is deep and unfathomable, far-reaching and immeasurable. Viewed through the lens of emotion, it cannot be grasped by the heart, yet when it reaches its ultimate, it returns to the root with nothing opposed. Thus it is said: "To know the standard is called 'mysterious virtue.' Mysterious virtue is profound, far-reaching, and contrary to things."

Then only does one attain great compliance.

Master Xizhai annotates: What is called the Dao does not reside in the realm of ears, eyes, sounds, or colors. Yet the world’s people regard what the eye sees as color and what the ear hears as sound, being obstructed by sounds and colors, unaware that seeing, hearing, perceiving, and knowing extend beyond sounds and colors. If one were to abruptly tell them, “Your seeing, hearing, perceiving, and knowing are not real,” who would not find it strange and laughable? Thus, the Dao cannot be made evident to the people, for they would deem it foolish and pity it. The people’s foolishness lies in being obstructed by sounds and colors, unable to free themselves. Even if I were to show them non-action and simplicity, they would still not awaken—how much less if I were to employ knowledge to instruct them?

The affliction of the people lies in excessive knowledge; when knowledge is not used rightly, it becomes perverse. If I cannot awaken them to their perversity but instead employ knowledge to instruct them, this only further opens the door to their falsity. Thus, governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane. If one were to act without contrivance and not awaken the people’s cunning minds, so that cunning minds do not arise, then purity and whiteness would be complete—could this not be called the state’s blessing?

What those above practice, those below emulate. There has never been a case where I remain tranquil while they are restless, where I remain plain and unadorned while the people are full of desires. Thus it is said: “To know these two is also my standard. To truly know the standard is called ‘mysterious virtue.’ Mysterious virtue is profound, far-reaching, and contrary to things.” Only by aligning with the Dao can this be called great compliance.

Liu Zhongping annotates:
To govern the state without knowledge is to open the celestial; to govern the state with knowledge is to open the human. Opening the celestial brings compliance—compliance allows one to act without contrivance, and thus governance is unoppressive yet ordered. Opening the human brings contrivance—contrivance leads to excessive scrutiny, and thus the people are no longer pure and become deficient. Hence it is said: “To govern the state with knowledge is the state’s bane; to govern the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing.”

The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they are good at lowering themselves—thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, when the sage desires to be above the people, he places his words below them; when he desires to lead the people, he places his person behind them. Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands in front, the people do not find him harmful. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without weariness. Because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him.

*Wang’s note: “Wang” signifies that to which the world turns and flows. To dwell above is to lower one’s voice; to share joy is to lower one’s tone.*

Su annotates:
The sage does not desire to be above or lead the people. Yet when he lowers himself and places his person behind, his Dao inevitably elevates and advances him.

Lü’s annotation:
That the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is because they excel at lowering themselves—thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys. Likewise, those who can be kings of the world excel at lowering themselves. The profound virtue (xuande) is precisely the Dao of lowering oneself to the utmost. Zhuang Zhou held that by dwelling in this lowliness, one embodies the Dao of the mysterious sage and unadorned king. When Shun remained below, it was said that his "profound virtue ascended to be heard"—thus, profound virtue is inherently the Dao by which the sage dwells in lowliness. To occupy a position above others while following the Dao of lowliness is to truly lower oneself.

When the sage possesses the world, in terms of his position, he indeed desires to be above the people. Yet he styles himself "orphaned, widowed, and unworthy" and accepts the world’s disgrace and misfortune—this is to place his words below them. In terms of precedence, he indeed desires to lead the people. Yet he moves only under compulsion, responds only to stimulus, and rises only when there is no alternative—this is to place his person behind them. Precisely because he places his words below, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome. Not burdensome, they thus find bearing him light. Because he places his person behind, though he stands in front, the people do not find him harmful. Not harmful, they thus find following him beneficial. Not burdensome and not harmful—this is why the world delights in exalting him without weariness. Because he places his words below and his person behind, he does not contend. Delighting in exalting him without weariness, none in the world can contend with him. Could one who does not embody profound virtue achieve this? Therefore, it is said: "Only because he does not contend can none in the world contend with him."

Xizhai’s annotation:
When the sage is compelled to oversee the world, how does he regard towering above all things or standing above the people? Thus, though he possesses the world, he can place his words below the people and his person behind them—none but one who guards the world can do this. Therefore, though he dwells above the people, they do not find him burdensome, unaware he is their ruler. Though he stands before them, they do not find him harmful, unaware they are his people. Only when ruler and ruled guard one another does the world delight in exalting him without weariness. For what I take is not what the people contend for. The world is governed by non-action—how could it show its traces, let alone be contended with?

The world all says my Dao is great yet seems unworthy. Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it were worthy, it would have long been petty. I possess three treasures, which I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world. Through compassion, one can be courageous; through frugality, one can be expansive; through not daring to be first, one can become the chief of vessels. Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, abandons frugality yet seeks expansiveness, abandons the last yet seeks the first—this is death. With compassion, one prevails in battle and stands firm in defense. Heaven will save and protect him with compassion.

Su’s annotation:
The Dao is vast and formless, declining and nameless, pervading all things yet resembling none—this is why it is great. If it resembled things, it would be but one thing among them—how could it be great?

The Dao is great precisely because it does not resemble things. Thus, when it operates as virtue, it moves dimly, finding advantage in dullness and advance in retreat, never conforming to worldly customs. Now, the world values courage, esteems vastness, and praises aggressive advancement, while what I treasure are compassion, forbearance, frugality, restraint, and humility—these three are all deemed unworthy by the world.

The world considers bold decisiveness worthy and compassionate forbearance inadequate for affairs, not knowing that bold decisiveness is easily thwarted, while compassionate forbearance cannot be overcome in the end—it must culminate in courage. The world values vastness to overshadow things and deems frugality and restraint base, not knowing that vastness is easily exhausted, while frugality and restraint are easily sufficient—they must culminate in expansiveness. The world esteems aggressive advancement as ability and regards not daring to be first as shameful, not knowing that aggressive advancement incurs much resentment from others, while not daring to be first brings joy in being pushed forward by the world—it must ultimately become the chief of vessels.

For when uncarved wood scatters to become vessels, the sage employs them as officials and leaders. Only after uncarved wood becomes vessels do they have subordinates and superiors. Courage, expansiveness, and being first—these three are what people universally resent. Resented by the multitude, they thus constantly verge on death. With compassion, one protects things, and things cherish him as parents; though they would die for him without hesitation, he can thus engage in battle and defense. When Heaven is about to save such a person, it opens his heart and will, making him compassionate without exception. If he is compassionate without exception, all things will protect him.

---

Lü’s annotation:
The world merely sees the greatness of my Dao and calls it unworthy, not realizing that its very greatness lies in appearing unworthy. How can this be explained? The Great Dao flows everywhere, left and right—there is nowhere it is not present. Those who see its absence in some places, its lack of resemblance to anything, call it unworthy, not knowing that its absence in no place and resemblance to nothing are precisely why the Dao is great.

For all things are none other than the Dao; thus, there is nothing outside the Dao. If there is nothing outside the Dao, there is nothing it resembles—this is why it is great. If it resembled something, there would be things outside the Dao. If there were things outside the Dao, the Dao would not be present in all places—how could it still be great? Therefore, it is said: "The world all says my Dao is great, seeming unworthy." Only because it is great does it seem unworthy. If it resembled things, it would long since have been insignificant.

Now, the reason my Dao is so great is that I have no self and do not contend. Only by having no self and not contending can one hold fast to what others find difficult to hold. I possess three treasures, which I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world—these are all things others find difficult to hold. Why? People cannot be without self and cannot cease contending. Thus, they are courageous but cannot be compassionate, expansive but cannot be frugal, forward but cannot be last. Only having no self and not contending enables one to preserve these three treasures and hold them fast.

The world has a beginning, which is taken as the mother of all things, and I guard it, ever tolerant toward things, never cutting them down—is this not compassion? In conducting oneself, one moves slowly and does not waste, taking restraint as the principle—is this not frugality? Never putting oneself before others, always following them, while others all seek to be first, I alone take the last—is this not "not daring to be first in the world"?

Compassion appears soft and weak yet can overcome the hard and strong—this is courage. Frugality appears wasteful yet its use cannot be exhausted—this is expansiveness. Not daring to be first in the world appears to put one last, yet the sage employs it to become an official and leader, for all follow me—this is becoming the chief of vessels.

Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, abandons frugality yet seeks expansiveness, abandons the last yet seeks the first, one is merely a brute of hardness and strength—is death not fitting? From a practical perspective, in military affairs, love establishes authority, and without deceit, there is no achievement—compassion seems as if it cannot be applied. Yet from a fundamental perspective, the very ability to establish authority lies in compassion. Therefore, it is said: "With compassion, one prevails in battle and stands firm in defense." Only through compassion does one attain frugality; through frugality, one does not dare to be first in the world. Thus, compassion is the origin of the three treasures. Abandoning compassion leads to death; preserving compassion leads to life. Compassion is thus what protects one’s life. Therefore, it is said: "Heaven will save and protect him with compassion." When compassion is established, the three treasures are complete.

---

Yuanze’s annotation:
"Resemblance" means having something to liken oneself to. The Dao is the ancestor of all things, so those who embody the Dao should resemble me—how could I resemble things? For if one resembles something, it is like imitating that thing, and that thing must be great while I am small.

These three treasures are all deemed insignificant by worldly sentiments, yet they are what the perfected person uses to become great. Compassion is rooted in love—loving things is benevolence. Yet it is uniquely called "compassion" because benevolence is a broad virtue that covers all below in its fullest expression. Laozi speaks of its root, so he does not say "benevolence" but "compassion." Compassion is the fatherly way, the root of benevolence, requiring no artificial effort.

Frugality as a virtue means few desires, valuing the root, and cherishing things. One word encompasses three excellences—what is more perfect than frugality? Confucius said: "In ritual, it is better to be frugal than extravagant." For the sage establishes ritual to encourage frugality, yet when practicing ritual, one cannot be frugal alone. Without ritual, there is no refinement; without Laozi, one does not know the root. Is the root not the ultimate? In the *Book of Changes*, this is modesty. Heaven, Earth, humans, and spirits all value modesty, so the sage treasures it.

Compassion does not contend yet is victorious—no courage is greater. Those who vainly expand themselves through extravagance are extremely narrow. Only those who do not harm the root with the branches, do not extinguish the internal with the external, attain the utmost expansiveness. This is the sage’s practice, so he merely becomes the chief of vessels. As for the Dao’s leadership, it has never lagged behind things.

To use humans to extinguish Heaven, to let affairs overcome the Dao—even if one escapes by luck, one has lost what sustains life. The three treasures are all Heavenly virtues and establish the root. This is like the "orthodox troops" in warfare—orthodox troops mean an army that is ordered and unmoving. Loving the people as children, the people love him as a father; without commands, they are united. Those who turn their weapons to attack from behind and are defeated do so because their superiors are not compassionate.

One version reads: "With compassion, one prevails in battle." Battle and defense are rooted in killing and attack, yet they esteem compassion as virtue—other matters can be inferred. Han Fei’s explanation:
One who loves a child is compassionate toward the child; one who values life is compassionate toward oneself; one who prizes achievement is compassionate toward affairs. A compassionate mother’s love for her weak child...

Pursue the attainment of fortune; by pursuing the attainment of fortune, affairs are freed from calamity. When affairs are freed from calamity, thoughts and plans mature. When thoughts and plans mature, one grasps the principles of affairs. Grasping the principles of affairs ensures certain success. Certain success means acting without doubt—acting without doubt is called courage.

The sage’s approach to all matters is like a compassionate mother’s care for her weak child. Thus, when one sees the Way that must be followed, one acts with clarity, and in undertaking affairs, there is no doubt—this, too, is called courage. Doubtlessness arises from compassion; hence it is said, "Compassion gives rise to courage."

The Duke of Zhou said: "In winter’s freezing closure, if not firm, the growth of grasses and trees in spring and summer will not flourish. Heaven and Earth cannot constantly indulge in excess or waste—how much less can man? Thus, all things must have flourishing and decline, all affairs must have tension and relaxation, states must have civil and martial governance, and official administration must have rewards and punishments. Therefore, the wise man conserves his resources to enrich his household; the sage cherishes his spirit to refine his essence. The ruler values his soldiers in war, and the people multiply; a numerous people expands the state. Hence it is said: 'Through frugality, one attains expansiveness.'"

Dong’s commentary: "This uses warfare to illustrate that the Dao’s excellence lies in upholding compassion. Some say: If we speak of the human body, then wayward thoughts are like enemy states, and desires are sharper than blades. Should we not then reduce desires to the point of none, to preserve what is truly treasured?"

Mengde’s commentary: "This concerns how I conduct myself. The *Yi* says: 'Nothing is not aided; difficulties are resolved.' Thus, among the Three Treasures, compassion is placed first, and the text ultimately clarifies that with it, one prevails in battle and stands firm in defense—this is the urgent need of the present age. If Heaven wishes to save the people, it must bring forth one who acts with compassion to protect them. This is what Laozi deeply laments, hoping for the world."

One who excels as a warrior is not martial; one who excels in battle is not angry; one who excels in defeating the enemy does not contend; one who excels in employing others humbles himself. This is called the virtue of non-contention; this is called employing the strength of others; this is called matching Heaven, the ultimate of antiquity.

In ancient times, chariot warfare involved three armored warriors on the chariot: the left wielded a bow, the right held a spear, and the center drove and managed the flags and drums—all sought to be strong and martial. Seventy-two infantrymen stood below the chariot. Since contention arises only in warfare, it is used here to illustrate the virtue of non-contention.

Luo Zhu said: "When mind and form are empty, who can contend with one who is without thing?"

Su’s commentary: "A warrior should take martial skill as the foundation but act with caution. If one acts with martiality in a martial manner, one will die. The sage resorts to battle only when unavoidable; if one acts out of anger, it is for one’s own sake that one kills. If one kills for one’s own sake, Heaven will surely bring calamity. Because I do not contend, I can overcome the contender. If both sides contend, victory is not assured. All people have the desire to surpass others, so none can be employed by another. If one truly humbles oneself, then all under Heaven become one’s resource."

Lü’s commentary: "The term *shi* (warrior) refers to one who serves the Dao and takes leading others as their duty. Serving the Dao means overcoming through non-contention; leading others means employing their strength. If so, what need is there for martiality? Hence it is said: 'One who excels as a warrior is not martial.' If a warrior has no need for martiality, then one who excels in battle is not angry, one who excels in defeating the enemy does not contend, and one who excels in employing others humbles himself—this is entirely fitting.

Why is this so? One who embodies the Dao does not contend; if one does not contend, none in the world can contend with them. Thus, one who excels as a warrior is not martial, one who excels in battle is not angry, and one who excels in defeating the enemy does not contend—this is called the virtue of non-contention. One who embodies the Dao can humble themselves; one who can humble themselves is gladly employed by others and does not act for themselves. Thus, one who excels in employing others humbles themselves—this is called employing the strength of others. With virtue, one does not contend; with strength, one employs others. Even in the peril of warfare, I remain effortless—how much more so in other matters? Acting through non-action is called the virtue of Heaven. When one reaches non-action, one aligns with Heaven and cannot be surpassed. Hence it is said: 'This is called matching Heaven, the ultimate of antiquity.'"

Xizhai’s commentary: "The sage does not even claim possession of their own body—how much less would they contend? Because they do not contend, all their responses to things arise from necessity. Thus, as a warrior, they are not martial; when fighting, they are not angry; when defeating the enemy, they do not necessarily contend with them; when employing others, they do not place themselves above them. Therefore, they can subdue others through virtue, and others are glad to die for them. This is called matching Heaven, the ultimate of antiquity."

There is a saying in warfare: "I dare not act as the host but as the guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot." This is called advancing without formation, seizing without arms, resisting without an enemy, and wielding without weapons. No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy; underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits what I treasure. Thus, when evenly matched armies meet, the one who grieves prevails.

Truly knowing that the constant of the Dao emerges from non-action, then in my conduct there is always non-conduct; in my repelling, always no arms; in my resistance, always no enemy; in my wielding, always no weapons. Where could one not prevail?

If one cannot emerge from non-action, knowing only the host and not the guest, knowing only advance and not retreat—this is called underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits what I treasure as the Three Treasures. Thus it is said: "No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy; underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure." Only one who takes non-contention as victory cannot be overcome. Thus it is said: "When evenly matched armies meet, the one who grieves prevails."

My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice—yet none under Heaven can know them, none can practice them. Words have their source; affairs have their lord. It is only because of ignorance that they do not know me. Those who know me are rare; thus I am esteemed. Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

To know yet seem not to know is supreme; not to know yet seem to know is a flaw. Only by regarding this flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw. The sage is without flaw because he regards the flaw as a flaw—thus he is without flaw.

The Xizhai Annotation states: "The knowing chase after things, thus they are full of artifice; the unknowing return to the root, thus they are close to the real. One who can know the unknowing is close to the real; knowing the knowing as full of artifice is supreme. If one does not recognize that knowing is artifice and merely increases their knowing, this is like taking illness as medicine—such illness cannot be fully described. Only by knowing that knowing is illness can one be without illness. The sage is without illness because he knows this."

The Bishu states: "The Dao enters through knowing and transforms through unknowing. Knowing is the Buddha’s 'knowing nothing'; unknowing is the Buddha’s 'nothing knowing.' First, one uses 'knowing nothing' to dispel existence, then uses 'nothing knowing' to dispel knowing. All dharmas return to nothingness, yet nothingness does not stand alone—how could this not be supreme? Yet when they impose views upon emptiness or conjure mountains and rivers within purity, plucking flowers from their eyes or mistaking shadows for heads, this is illness. All knowing is delusion; all delusion is illness. Scholars, accustomed to grasping at what they deem profound and treasuring it, how can their illness be cured? The sage cannot abandon knowing, just as others cannot, yet knowing does not become illness for him because he knows that knowing is illness. Knowing it as illness, the illness is cured without medicine. 'Knowing the unknowing' is supreme—what is born yet without birth, the true nature serene. 'Not knowing the knowing' is illness—what is unborn yet born, karma and fruit manifest. Only by regarding illness as illness can one be without illness—this is 'knowing illusion and immediately departing, not employing expedient means.'"

When the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives. Do not constrict their dwelling; do not weary of their life. Only by not wearying can one be unwearying. Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself; loves himself but does not esteem himself. Therefore, he discards that and adopts this.

Su’s Annotation states: "Human nature inherently possesses authority—lofty, luminous, vast, and resplendent—nothing can surpass it. This is what is called great authority. People are constantly troubled by drowning in delusions, fearing life and death, and dreading the myriad threats of things that assail them, leaving no respite for lifelong anxiety. Though great authority exists, they do not recognize it. If one truly knows, life and death are equal, gains and losses are level—fearlessly, great authority appears before them. The greatness of nature can envelop heaven and earth, yet the unknowing take their four limbs and nine orifices as themselves, guarding them without weariness. Thus, their vision does not extend beyond seeing, their hearing does not extend beyond listening—they are utterly confined. Therefore, the teaching says: 'Do not constrict their dwelling.' Those who know this recognize the vastness of nature and the narrowness of their own lives, thus they lament, desiring escape yet unable, unaware of the path of weariness and longing, bound by things. Therefore, the teaching says: 'Do not weary of their life.' Only the sage is neither constricted nor wearied. Born like others, he dwells with the Dao, without distinction between vastness and narrowness, purity and filth. Only after not wearying of life does one know that life is not wearying. Though the sage knows himself, he does not display himself; though he loves himself, he does not esteem himself, fearing that others will develop weariness and longing. Until the heart of weariness and longing is dispelled, fear remains. Only when fear departs does great authority arrive."

Lü’s Annotation states: "When the people are not attuned to the Dao but rely solely on knowledge, their lives become excessive, and with excessive life comes disregard for death. Disregarding death, they do not fear authority. When the people reach the point of not fearing authority, there is nothing they will not do—this is how Heaven manifests its authority and metes out great punishment. Thus it is said: 'When the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives.' Only one who governs the world with the Dao knows that all under Heaven, born of Heaven, share the same dwelling—let it not be constricted, and the spirit will flow unimpeded in all directions. All under Heaven, born of Heaven, share the same life—let it not be wearied, and the people will have no constant attachment to the self. Only by not wearying can the people also not weary—how then could they not fear authority? Therefore, the sage knows himself through constancy yet does not display himself, placing himself externally. Knowing constancy and placing himself externally, he does not constrict his dwelling. Loving himself through frugality yet not esteeming himself, relinquishing his life, he does not weary of life. Thus, he discards the illness of knowledge and adopts the non-illness of not knowing."

Yuanzhe’s Annotation states: "When the people are simple and the ruler is generous, they fear authority. When the ruler loses the Dao and engages in excessive action, diminishing the Dao and obstructing life, the people become cunning and insincere, and authority cannot subdue them. In this case, Heaven’s punishment will be applied, and calamities will arise. Thus it is said: 'Great authority arrives.' Human nature is inherently vast and flowing, yet as worldly teachings decline, it cannot return to simplicity. Instead, its dwelling is constricted, making it narrow, and its life is wearied, making it obstructed. Only by constricting their dwelling do the people become impure and artificial; only by wearying their life do they become thin and insincere. The sage is not like this—he allows the people to roam freely in the vast dwelling of the world, each fulfilling their expansive nature. Then, how could they offend authority? Zhuangzi said: 'The lands of the Xirong and Xunwei, the parks of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of Yao and Shun, the halls of Tang and Wu'—this illustrates how each generation declines, gradually constricting their dwelling. Were those sages of varying excellence? No, the circumstances of their times made it so. The ruler does not weary of his own life, fully realizing his nature, so the people also realize their nature. Zhuangzi said: 'Not wearying of Heaven'—this is what it means. Weariness is Heaven’s weariness. Displaying oneself leads to pride in achievement; esteeming oneself leads to belittling others. This is how one constricts their own dwelling and wearies their own life, thereby constricting the people’s dwelling and wearying their life. Knowing oneself is clarity of nature, not engaging in delusion; loving oneself is preserving the body, not committing wrongs. How then could one offend Heaven’s authority?"

Dong’s Annotation states: "Dwelling is the ground of nature. Dwelling in the vast dwelling of the world, one’s body becomes one with the great void. Life is the gathering of qi, containing the utmost essence of the Great One, its function the same as creation."

Only the narrow-minded scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao. If one is not submerged in petty techniques yet truly has no means to constrict their own dwelling, they will surely abandon the existent for the non-existent and be deluded by annihilation, thereby wearying what gives them life. Thus, one is instructed in non-constriction and non-weariness, so that learners may know that nature is the commander of qi, its greatness boundless—it should be expanded and filled to preserve its vastness. Life is the lodging of the Dao, its function inexhaustible—it should be nurtured and cultivated to fulfill its use. Then, in nurturing qi, preserving life, fully realizing nature, and fulfilling destiny, no weariness or longing arises, for one embodies nothing that is not strength, nothing that is not vitality.

Long life is not clinging to life, nor is life an obstacle. In this way, life dwells with the Dao, and the Dao never wearies of or abandons humanity. To "see worthiness" is to make it universally manifest. Through self-knowledge, one reflects inwardly without fear and does not constrict their dwelling; through self-love, one severs external cravings and does not weary their life. Only self-knowledge and self-love bring tranquility to one’s dwelling. Yet by not displaying oneself to boast of ability, and not esteeming oneself to belittle others, one forgets the perception of being known and the heart of being loved.

**Xizhai’s Annotation:**
Those who seek others’ awe and affection are all inwardly deficient and outwardly longing. The sage is inwardly sufficient, viewing others’ joy without adding to it, their lack of fear without diminishing it—thus, all things are at ease with them without effort. To place oneself above things, making others fear oneself, is easy; to make others unafraid of oneself is difficult. To make me guard against others is easy; to make the world guard against me is hard. If the people do not fear authority, it is because the world guards against me—this is none other than the authority of virtue and the Dao. The sage encounters things and rests in whatever they meet, never constricting their dwelling nor wearying their life, for they know that their dwelling and life are not their true reality. Only because I do not weary myself does life not weary me. From self-knowledge comes the absence of self-display, though knowledge exists; from self-love comes the absence of self-esteem, though love exists. If one harbors the heart of self-display and self-esteem, they constrict their dwelling and weary their life, unable to find peace even for a day.

**Wu’s Annotation:**
What is fearful harms life and injures the body; the greatest fear is death. Those who do not fear what should be feared will injure their bodies, harm their lives, and hasten their death—then the greatest fear arrives. Zhuangzi said: "What people take as fearful lies in their bed and at their meals, yet they do not guard against it—this is their error." *Xia* (狎) means familiarity and habit. One’s dwelling is where the body resides; *yan* (厌) means to detest and abandon. In daily life, one fearlessly indulges in things that harm life and injure the body, becoming habituated and complacent—this is not fearing authority. To weary one’s life is to harm life and hasten death, detesting one’s existence and abandoning one’s destiny—then the greatest fear arrives. Only by not becoming familiar with one’s dwelling and fearing what should be feared can one avoid wearying their life, and the greatest fear will not come. *Self-knowledge* is knowing the way of loving one’s body; *self-display* is flaunting one’s knowledge to others; *self-esteem* (as in a later chapter) refers to the excessive desire for life. The sage, though inwardly knowing the way of self-love, embodies virtue and conceals illumination, knowing as if not knowing, not outwardly displaying it. Though deeply loving life, they embody the Dao naturally, not clinging to life or committing the error of excessive desire. The former refers to self-display and self-esteem; the latter refers to self-knowledge and self-love. The above speaks of not fearing leading to the calamity of great fear, and not becoming familiar leading to the blessing of non-weariness—this is addressed to the common people. As for the sage, they do not wait for fear to be without what is fearful, nor do they wait for non-familiarity to be without what is familiar. Inwardly, they possess the reality of self-knowledge and self-love; outwardly, they leave no trace of self-display or self-esteem. What is absent is what is discarded; what is present is what is embraced.

Those bold in daring meet death; those bold in restraint live. These two may bring either benefit or harm—who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion? Thus, even the sage finds this difficult.

The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory, does not speak yet excels in response, is not summoned yet comes of itself, and is unhurried yet excels in planning. Heaven’s net is vast and sparse, yet nothing escapes it.

*(Annotations in the original: "殺" means death; "利" refers to life, "害" to death; "惡" is read in the departing tone; "繟" is pronounced "chǎn," meaning leisurely and unhurried. Wang Bi’s version uses "坦," while Yan Zun’s uses "默," but "繟" is superior, for "默" implies excessive weight in silence, and "坦" approaches non-contention.)*

Su Zhe’s commentary:
To be bold in daring is to die; to be bold in restraint is to live—this is the constant principle of things. Yet the daring may sometimes survive, and the restrained may sometimes perish, leading the world to chance upon such exceptions while ignoring the regular pattern. How vast is the Dao of Heaven! Even if there is an exception, who knows whence its preferences and aversions arise? Thus, even the sage takes the constant as the norm and ever finds the matter of bold daring difficult.

Liezi says: "To anticipate Heaven’s intent and weigh profit and harm is not as good as refraining." How difficult it is to fathom the Dao of Heaven! Therefore, it is expounded in detail: one does not contend with things in the moment but seeks ultimate victory. What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born.

No seeker goes unanswered—
the advent of the numinous cannot be measured,
how much less can it be aimed at?
Yet who summons it?

It unfolds with ease, as if aimless,
yet its plans and measures surpass human reach.
The world observes Heaven through the senses,
seeing but a fragment and missing the great whole.
When good meets misfortune and evil meets fortune,
none doubts the looseness of Heaven’s net and its many lapses.

Only by grasping the beginning and end,
exhausting all transformations,
does one know its vastness—
though seemingly loose, it never fails.

---

**Lü’s Commentary:**
To impose one’s strength and insist on things is to be "bold in daring"—such are the ranks of the dead. Hence it is said: "Bold in daring is to die."
To yield one’s rigidity and commit to nothing is to be "bold in restraint"—such are the ranks of the living. Hence it is said: "Bold in restraint is to live."
What men deem gain in bold daring may harbor harm;
what men deem harm in bold restraint may harbor gain.
Yet Heaven’s aversions—how can they be known by knowledge or recognized by perception?
Thus the sage’s every move is
as cautious as wading winter streams,
as wary as fearing four neighbors—
so difficult is it, for Heaven’s aversions are unknowable.
Only by remaining unknowing and unperceiving
can one accord with the Emperor’s principles.

Heaven gives life to things according to their nature and enriches them:
what is planted, it nurtures;
what leans, it topples.
It never contends with things,
yet nothing can defy it.
Thus it is said: "Not contending, yet excelling in victory."
What does Heaven say?
The four seasons proceed,
the myriad things are born—
their procession and birth never err.
Thus it is said: "Not speaking, yet excelling in response."
What acts without acting is Heaven;
what arrives without being summoned is fate.
Thus it is said: "Uncalled, it comes of itself."
The *Yi* is easy to know,
its Dao waxes and wanes with time,
never deviating.
Thus it is said: "At ease, yet excelling in planning."
Heaven’s keen hearing comes from the people’s keen hearing;
Heaven’s bright majesty comes from the people’s bright majesty.
Its hearing and majesty are never self-serving—
blessing follows compliance,
misfortune follows defiance,
swift as echo follows sound.
Thus it is said: "Heaven’s net is vast, seemingly loose, yet never failing."
Only because Heaven’s Dao is unknowable in this way
does the sage practice bold restraint,
remaining unknowing and unperceiving—
this is how one accords with it.

---

**Xizhai’s Commentary:**
People know "bold in daring" but not "bold in restraint."
"Bold in daring" is treading on naked blades;
"bold in restraint" is treading the Middle Way.
Thus it is said: "Blades may be trodden, but the Middle Way cannot."
Comparing the two:
treading blades brings harm, yet people dismiss the harm;
treading the Middle Way brings benefit, yet people ignore the benefit.
Is this not why the Middle Way is so difficult?
To act with reckless boldness is what men resent and Heaven abhors—
who knows the reason?
Even the sage finds it hard,
how much more the common people!

For Heaven’s Dao:
not contending, yet excelling in victory;
not speaking, yet excelling in response;
uncalled, yet coming of itself;
at ease, yet excelling in planning.
Knowing its aversion to reckless boldness—
before Heaven’s victory, before its response,
before its arrival, before its plans are set,
one might say the strong sometimes prevail,
the bold sometimes win—
such cases exist.
But observe the outcome in time,
and you will see:
Heaven’s net is vast, seemingly loose, yet never failing.

---

**Wu’s Commentary:**
The recklessly bold are those Heaven abhors,
yet Heaven’s aversions are profound and obscure—
how can one know who is truly abhorred?
Even when such a person deserves death,
the sage still hesitates and does not lightly kill.
If the sage does not lightly kill,
then wrongdoers all slip through the net—
does this mean Heaven’s net has gaps?
Heaven’s dealings with the wicked are not like man’s forceful contention;
Heaven’s victory is certain without effort.
They are not like man’s verbal pronouncements;
its responses are as swift as echo follows sound.
Its retribution comes quickly,
arriving unsummoned.
The wicked meet their due,
and no cunning can escape.
Though Heaven is without intent,
calm and unhurried,
its retribution is more artful than human schemes.
This is Heaven’s vast net—
seemingly loose, yet never failing.
Not a single wrongdoer escapes;
none slip through.
Though the sage does not kill,
Heaven kills of itself.

---

**Hongfu’s Commentary:**
Victory through non-contention,
response through non-speaking,
arrival through non-summoning—
this is Heaven’s seeming looseness that never fails.
If one contends to win,
though not loose, there will be failure.

---

The people do not fear death—
why threaten them with it?
If one could make them always fear death
and execute those who act strangely,
who would dare?
Yet there is always an executioner—
to kill in place of the executioner
is like hewing in place of the master carpenter.
Few who hew in place of the master carpenter
do not injure their hands.

---

**Su’s Commentary:**
When governance is oppressive and punishments severe,
the people have nowhere to turn—
they cease to fear death.
Threatening them with death is futile.
When the people are at ease with good governance,
they cherish life and fear death.
Then, seizing those who act strangely and disrupt order to execute them—
who would dare disobey?
The executioner is Heaven.
In a well-ordered age,
if strange and disruptive people run rampant,
they are Heaven’s rejects.
To kill them is to act as Heaven’s agent—
not my own doing.
To kill those not rejected by Heaven
is to kill in place of the executioner.
To hew in place of the master carpenter is to injure one’s hands;
to kill in place of the executioner is to bring harm upon oneself.

---

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The people’s nature is such that they do not fear death.
Only by not constricting their dwelling,
not sating their desires,
can one make them respect authority and value life.
Why threaten them with death to make them fear it?
How do we know this?
If the people always feared death
and one could seize and execute those who act strangely,
who would dare?
Yet seizing them does not stop them,
killing them does not end it—
this proves the people do not fear death
and cannot be threatened with it.

Then how should one govern the world through the Dao?

Let the executioners kill—do not usurp their role.

What does it mean to let the executioners kill?
The Heavenly net is vast and wide, its mesh sparse yet nothing escapes.
When Heaven punishes crime, the five punishments and five penalties are applied—
this is the executioner’s role, Heaven’s own work.

If punishments and executions arise from personal preference
rather than Heaven’s judgment,
then one is usurping the executioner’s role.

To usurp the executioner’s role is to usurp the master carpenter’s axe—
few who do so escape harm to their hands.
Thus, the harm of usurping the executioner’s role is clear.

---
**Zhang Lin’s Commentary:**
Human life is not taken at the hearth or in meals;
disease, theft, and punishments claim more than half.
Thus, people do not truly know fear of death.
Yet those who govern things wish them to fear—
only by threatening death can they hope to instill fear.
Hence it is said: *The people do not fear death—
why threaten them with death?*
If they truly feared death,
I could seize and execute those who act strangely—
who would dare?
Yet seizing them does not stop them,
killing them does not end it—
this proves death cannot incite fear.
Thus it is said:
*If the people feared death and acted strangely,
I could seize and execute them—who would dare?*
Things do not fear those who wield death,
for all things fade and return to extinction—
only then does the executioner’s role persist.
To seize the executioner’s authority and use it to instill fear
is not only insufficient to deter things
but also fails to reach its mark.
Thus it is said:
*Let the executioners kill—
to usurp their role is to usurp the master carpenter’s axe,*
and few escape harm to their hands.
Then how can one who holds the reins of governance,
driving all under Heaven’s people to obey,
do so rightly?

---
**Xīzhāi’s Annotation:**
This shows that the world’s laws are unreliable for governance.
The people do not fear death—
why threaten them with death?
If the people truly feared death,
seizing and executing those who act strangely
would suffice to govern.
Yet the more one kills, the less it deters—
punishment is insufficient.
The Qin used strict laws with a dense net,
yet crimes did not cease.
The Han loosened the net, letting even great offenders slip through,
yet all under Heaven turned to them.
This alone proves it.
Heaven’s way rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness—
the executioner’s role is fixed within its bounds, inescapable.
If one must usurp the executioner’s role,
like usurping the master carpenter’s axe,
there are none who do not harm their hands.

---
**Xuē’s Annotation:**
Our dynasty’s Emperor Taizu, in his preface to the *Dao De Jing*, said:
*"Since my ascension, I knew not the Way of ancient sage-kings.
I asked others, but all spoke from their own perspectives.
One day, I read the *Dao De Jing*—
its words were simple, its meaning profound.
Later, I saw in the text: ‘The people do not fear death—
why threaten them with death?’
At that time, the world had just been unified,
the people were stubborn, officials corrupt.
Though ten were executed in the morning,
a hundred more arose in the evening.
Was this not as the text foretold?
I abolished extreme punishments and confined them to labor—
within a year, my heart grew lighter.
I knew this text was the root of all things,
the supreme teacher of kings,
the utmost treasure of subjects and ministers—
not mere alchemical arts.
Ah! The Emperor was indeed a sage of Heaven’s endowment,
his wisdom and insight penetrating the text’s depths.
Thus, the sage-king of the Yuan Dynasty, Taizu, was born.
The words of the virtuous spread far and wide—
this is the *Dao De Jing*."

---
The people hunger because their rulers take too much in taxes—
thus hunger arises.
Governance is difficult because rulers act—
thus difficulty arises.
The people treat death lightly because life is made too plentiful—
thus they treat death lightly.
Only those who do not cling to life
are wiser than those who prize it.

---
**Sū’s Annotation:**
When rulers act excessively, the people respond in kind—
thus governance becomes complex.
When rulers prioritize profit and desire,
the people compete for abundance in life,
so even death cannot sate their greed.
Thus, those who do not cling to life
preserve themselves naturally.

---
**Lǚ’s Commentary:**
If one man’s labor feeds several households,
why should there be hunger?
Yet hunger exists—
is it not because rulers take too much in taxes?
Weave and you are clothed; till and you are fed—
this is harmony in virtue.
Why is governance difficult?
Is it not because rulers act excessively?
If their food is sweet, their garments fine,
their customs settled, their dwellings joyous—
why should they treat death lightly?
Yet they do—
is it not because life is made too plentiful?
Thus the sage acts without action, and the people prosper naturally.
The sage desires nothing, and the people return to simplicity.
Then there is no hunger from excessive taxation,
no difficulty from governance through action,
no lightness toward death from abundance in life.
It is because they struggle for gain,
chase knowledge, and vie for profit—
this cannot be stopped.
Thus, those who do not cling to life
are wiser than those who prize it is clear.
Therefore, the sage does not exalt himself,
does not value his body,
does not cherish his life—
he knows only to act without clinging to life.

---
**Xīzhāi’s Annotation:**
If rulers take much, the people grow poor.
If rulers act, the people rebel—
this is inevitable.
I seek to enrich their lives,
yet neglect others’—
how can they not treat death lightly?
The sage’s regard for life is not indulgent;
he sees others as not clinging to life.
Would he enrich himself while depriving others?
This is what it means to be wiser than those who prize life.

---
A living thing is soft and weak;
when it dies, it becomes hard and strong.
Grass and trees, when living, are soft and brittle;
when dead, they wither and decay.
Thus, hardness and strength belong to death,
softness and weakness to life.
Therefore, the strong in arms are not victorious,
the strong in wood are easily broken—
the great place the low, the weak the high.

---
**Annotations:**
*Firm and strong belong to death’s domain;
soft and weak to life’s.
When hands join, they are called *gòng* (共).
*Shang* (商) and *Sāng* (桑) are trees;
*Gǔ* (谷) grows in the morning and reaches full size in seven days.
*Qín Bó* (秦伯) was angry, and *Shèng Shū* (蹇叔) said:
*"The tomb trees have grown to encircle the grave"*—
all have bent to embrace it.
*Dòng* (董) sounds as written;
*chù* (处) means "place."
*Gòng* (共) here means "to act together, to join in felling."
*Shàng* (上) is "above," *xià* (下) is "below."

The **Dao** abides within—
when **qi** surges forth, the body knows no ailment of hardness and strength;
when the utmost principle resides, affairs bear no burden of rigidity and force.
Army that triumphs through righteousness is not strong;
strength without righteousness—its defeat is swift.
Wood that bends itself to encircle must be felled—
this is the nature of things:
the refined rests above, the coarse below;
the refined must be soft and weak, the coarse strong and great.

---

**Commentary of Lü:**

The **Dao**, as a thing, is formless yet does not contend—
thus, the utmost **gù** (孤, "lonely") and weak, yet none comprehend it.
Therefore, I liken it to form:
*"Man’s life is soft and weak, his death firm and strong;
wood’s life is soft and brittle, its death withered and decayed.
Though form exists, it dies in rigidity and lives in softness—
how much more so the **Dao**, formless, that does not attain softness?
Thus, armies strong in arms grow arrogant, inviting enemy schemes—
my arrogance invites their plots, so I do not prevail.
Wood strong in trunk must be felled—
this is not mere chance.
But in terms of station:
Heaven’s **qi** is above, Earth’s form below—
**qi** is soft and weak, form firm and strong.
Ministers act; the sovereign nurtures.
Action is firm and strong, inaction soft and weak.
Firm and strong dwell below, soft and weak above—
this is the nature of things.
Thus, it is clear that softness and weakness can overcome rigidity and strength.

---

**Commentary of Xī Zhāi:**

This chapter broadly speaks of softness and weakness bringing life,
rigidity and strength bringing death.
Though softness and weakness are not the **Dao** itself,
they approach *wuwei* (無為, non-action);
rigidity and strength, though distant from the **Dao**,
lean toward *youwei* (有為, action).
*Wuwei* does not stray far from the **Dao**,
but *youwei* brings fortune and misfortune, regret and blame—
ever more distant from the **Dao**.

---

**Commentary of Wú:**

When wielding arms, feigning weakness conceals deep strategy,
while the enemy, lighthearted, underestimates—thus victory.
Relying on strength invites shallow calculation and arrogance,
while the enemy, fearful, prepares—thus defeat.
The art of war begins like a maiden’s modesty,
then bursts forth like a fleeing hare—
if the enemy cannot intercept, victory is assured.

The armies of Qin, crossing Zhou’s border with three hundred chariots,
were defeated at Zhaoyao.
The armies of Qi, invading Jin, were ambushed by Jie Shi’s stones—
both perished by their own overconfidence.

*Gòng* (共) means the two hands encircling.
The weak, swaying reeds are the slender branches near the end;
the strong, unyielding trunks are the sturdy roots.
Thus, armies strong in arms are felled by others—
this is dwelling below.
Wood strong in trunk, near the roots, is also below—
yet it cannot rise like the slender branches.

Pushing this principle further:
In human virtue, those rigid and strong, proud and domineering,
shall stumble—
their lofty station shall bring them low.
The soft and weak, revered by all,
shall ascend in esteem.

---

**Heaven’s Way—like drawing a bow:**
The high are pressed down, the low raised;
the overabundant are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
Heaven’s Way: to diminish the surplus and supplement the lacking.
But man’s Way is not so:
he diminishes the lacking to serve the surplus.
Who can, with their surplus, nourish all under Heaven?
Only the **Dao**-bearing Sage.
Thus, the Sage acts yet does not rely on results,
achieves yet does not claim them—
his virtue is unseen.

---

**Commentary of Xī Shēng:**

*The Book of Changes* says:
*"Establish Heaven’s Way—it is yin and yang.
Yang ascends, yin descends.
When yang reaches its peak, it descends;
when yin reaches its peak, it ascends.
This is pressing down the high and raising the low—
the image of a drawn bow."*

Heaven’s Way of surplus and deficiency:
seven *rùn* (闰, intercalary) days to compensate for the sun’s excess,
supplementing the moon’s lack.
But man’s Way is otherwise:
he diminishes the lacking people to serve the surplus ruler.
Who can model Heaven’s Way for man’s?
Only the Sage, who diminishes his surplus to nourish all under Heaven.

In *Changes*, *"Punishing the high, benefiting the low"* is *Sǔn* (损),
*"Benefiting the high, punishing the low"* is *Yì* (益)—
the low is the foundation.
Thus, the Sage acts yet does not rely on deeds,
achieves yet does not dwell on them—
his virtue is unseen by men.
Therefore, the world calls him *"seemingly unfilial"*—
all to diminish the surplus and serve the lacking.

---

**Commentary of Sū:**

Drawing a bow:
when slack, the upper sinew droops, the lower angle rises;
when taut, the upper angle rises, the lower sinew droops.
Thus, pressing down the high and raising the low—
Heaven has no bias, so it balances.
Men are biased, so they do not balance.
The **Dao**-bearing Sage nourishes all things without complaint—
giving to others only increases his own abundance,
bestowing upon others only multiplies his own wealth.
None but the **Dao**-bearing can endure this.
If one acts yet relies on results,
dwells on achievements—
then virtue is seen in the world,
and virtue seen in the world is but self-aggrandizement.

---

**Commentary of Lü:**

Heaven’s Way is simply *wuwei*.
*Wuwei* means no partiality, no partiality means balance—
just as drawing a bow:
the high are pressed down, the low raised;
the surplus diminished, the lacking supplemented—
this is balance alone.

Heaven’s Way does not deliberately press down the high or raise the low;
*wuwei* lets things follow their nature—
the high become surplus and must be pressed down,
the low become lacking and must be raised.
*"Fullness invites diminishment, humility invites benefit"*—
this is Heaven’s Way.

But man’s Way cannot be *wuwei*;
cannot be *wuwei*, so cannot be without partiality;
cannot be without partiality, so diminishes the lacking to serve the surplus—
the difference is clear.

Only the **Dao**-bearing knows:
before things exist, there is no action or achievement—
wealth and fame are my surplus, the world’s lack.
Thus, he diminishes his surplus to nourish all under Heaven,
yet does not possess it—
hence, *"Who can diminish his surplus to nourish all under Heaven?
Only the **Dao**-bearing Sage."*

The Sage acts yet does not rely on results,
achieves yet does not dwell on them—
his virtue is unseen by men.
This is no other than following Heaven’s Way.

Now, the **Dao**-bearing Sage understands:

*"To gather much and benefit the few is the Way of Heaven;
to gather the few and benefit the many is the Way of man.*
Only the Sage can diminish his own surplus to nourish others’ lack,
thus his power reaches all things without relying on it—
his achievements overshadow all under Heaven yet he does not claim them,
his blessings extend to all under Heaven yet he does not seek recognition as virtuous.
Only the **Dao**-bearing can act thus.*

Nothing under Heaven is softer or weaker than water,
yet in overcoming the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—
for there is nothing to replace it.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong.

Nothing under Heaven does not know this,
yet few can practice it.
Therefore, the Sage says:
*"To bear the defilement of the state is called the sovereign of the land;
to bear the misfortunes of the state is called the king of all under Heaven.*
This is **Dao**-conforming speech turned upside-down."

**Xu Zhu’s annotation:**
*"**Dao**-conforming speech aligns with the Way yet opposes common conventions.
Common men regard bearing defilement as shame and misfortunes as calamity—
thus the Sage’s words."*

**Lü Buwei’s annotation:**
*"Among all things under Heaven, only water follows the contours of the curved and straight, the round and square—
this is its softness and weakness, unmatched by any.
Yet it flows over vast lands, turns great stones, pierces steep cliffs, and carries all things across the Earth—
only water can do this, making it unsurpassed in overcoming the hard and strong.
The reason lies in its nature:
though it twists and turns in countless forms, it never loses its essence as water—
this is why nothing can replace it.
Water’s softness and weakness conquer hardness and strength,
though all know this, the Master repeatedly emphasizes it—
for all know it yet few can embody it.
Though one may be clever and wise enough to rule,
his woe lies not in lacking ability or strength,
but in failing to diminish his surplus to nourish the world,
to govern with softness and weakness yet always be burdened by empty titles,
a mere corpse of wisdom, weighed down by the schemes of ministers.
Thus, the Master speaks of the end of **Dao** and virtue,
and repeatedly returns to this principle,
also citing the Sage’s words to confirm it:
*'To bear the defilement of the state is called the sovereign of the land;
to bear the misfortunes of the state is called the king of all under Heaven.'*
He makes clear that the true means of subduing the world lies here,
not in the other empty words.
The kings of the Three Dynasties must first be known for their good reputation,
yet they say: *'To bear the defilement of the state is called the sovereign of the land;
to bear the misfortunes of the state is called the king of all under Heaven.'*
Why so?
It is not merely to avoid fame’s empty words—
those are insufficient.
To bear the defilement and misfortunes of the state is to transcend fame’s words,
for fame cannot describe it.
Fame’s words do not reach the truth—
they are merely responses to circumstances.
The Sage’s words embody the **Dao**—
they are the true speech.
Yet he says: *'To bear the defilement of the state is called the sovereign of the land;
to bear the misfortunes of the state is called the king of all under Heaven.'*
Thus, it is called **Dao**-conforming speech turned upside-down."*

**Shen Ye’s annotation:**
*"Though hardness and strength may conquer hardness and strength,
they will always end in flaws and exhaustion.
Thus, nothing can surpass softness and weakness in overcoming hardness and strength—
the soft and weak conquer without intent yet naturally prevail.
Hence, he warns: *'Do not treat softness and weakness lightly!'
In the end, softness and weakness conquer hardness and strength,
while hardness and strength cannot contend with them.
Mountains and forests harbor diseases—
this is the utmost softness.
Rivers and marshes collect filth—
this is the utmost weakness.
If one claims to be the sovereign of the land yet cannot bear the defilement of all directions,
or to be the king of all under Heaven yet demands the state be free from calamity and the seas from evil,
can such a man exist?
Even if he seeks to eliminate and extinguish them,
he will only exhaust himself in vain.
This is indeed **Dao**-conforming speech turned upside-down,
yet in truth, it is the most **Dao**-conforming speech of all—
one must carefully observe it."*

「To reconcile great grudges, there must inevitably be lingering grudges—
how can this be considered good?
Hence, the Sage holds the left tally without demanding recompense from others,
so that those with **virtue** govern the tally and those without govern the passing through.
The **Dao** has no partiality, always favoring the virtuous.

**【Tally (契):** *a wooden token split in two, each half held by different parties to confirm agreements or transactions. **Left tally (左契):*** the half kept by the giver, symbolizing trust without coercion. **Right tally (右契):*** the half held by the receiver, used for verification. **Passing through (彻):*** forcing a transaction or demanding payment. **Sympathy (讣):*** a variant of "tally," here implying a forced or partial reconciliation. **】*

**【Sū’s Annotation:】**
Grudges arise from delusion, and delusion stems from human nature.
Those who understand human nature do not see delusion manifest,
so how could there be grudges?
Now, if one does not remove the root yet seeks to reconcile the branches,
then even if the surface appears reconciled, the inner resentment remains unguarded.
The left and right tallies exist to establish trust and prevent disputes—
the Sage treats others as he would the tally, demonstrating **Dao**-conforming conduct
without partiality or calculation.
He shows people their true nature,
teaching them to eliminate delusion and restore their original state,
so that when delusion is exhausted and nature returns,
they naturally find fulfillment without needing the left tally’s restraint
or the right tally’s demands.
Thus, though great grudges persist,
they will dissolve like melting ice—
knowing their root is nonexistent,
why bother reconciling?
Those without **virtue** who seek to force universal harmony
will only labor in vain.
The **Dao** has no partiality, always aligning with the virtuous—
this is the governance of the tally.
The **Dao** has no favoritism, only the virtuous receive its blessing—
this too is the governance of the tally.

**【Lǚ’s Annotation:】**
When retaliating, one does not break the tally;
though there may be resentment, no grudge is held.
Roof tiles may fall, but the **Dao** of universal balance does not arise from this.
Thus, grudges spring from those who seek to reconcile them—
if one insists on reconciling great grudges, the lingering resentment will never end.
Hence, it is said:
*"To reconcile great grudges, there must be lingering grudges—
how can this be considered good?"*
Therefore, the Sage holds the left tally without demanding recompense,
allowing those who come to take to do so naturally,
without calculating their virtue or malice.
Reconciling grudges involves a desire to benefit others,
but it is not as pure as the **Dao**-conforming conduct of holding the left tally,
observing things in stillness,
and letting nature take its course.
Those with **virtue** act without calculation;
those without **virtue** act with scheming intent.
**Passing through** is the scheming way.
In ancient times, the **Eight Families (八家)** assisted in farming,
but the Duke of Zhōu feared their private fields would yield uneven harvests,
so he ordered them to work together and share equally.
The **Eight Families** received equal rewards,
with no surplus or deficiency—
this was the governance of the left tally,
allowing others to take without concern for their virtue or malice.
Thus, those who govern the **Dao** of the tally
do not demand recompense from others,
while those who govern the **Dao** of passing through
scheme to force transactions.
Reconciling grudges fears the virtuous may suffer,
but even with good intentions,
it resembles the governance of passing through—
those who assist the weak fear their rewards will be meager.

**【Wú’s Annotation:】**
To hold the left tally without demanding recompense
is to act without scheming intent.
The tally is a split wooden token used as proof;
the giver holds the left half, the receiver the right.
When one demands payment from another, it is called *"demanding the tally (责契)."*
The left tally belongs to the giver,
while the right is given to the receiver.
The *Shǐjì* records that one *"holds the right tally to demand service (操右契以责事),"*
and the *Lǐjì* states that those *"offering land or houses hold the right tally (献田宅者操右契)."*
The left tally is held by the receiver,
as explained by Zhèng.
Holding the left tally means
one does not demand recompense from others,
but waits for them to come and take from oneself—
if they bring the right tally to match, then the transaction is given freely,
without calculation or partiality.
Reconciling grudges involves scheming to benefit others,
but it is not as pure as the **Dao**-conforming conduct of holding the left tally,
observing things in stillness,
and letting nature take its course.
Those with **virtue** act without scheming intent;
those without **virtue** act with calculation.
**Passing through** is the scheming way.

In ancient times, the **Eight Families (八家)** assisted in farming,
but the Duke of Zhōu feared their private fields would yield uneven harvests,
so he ordered them to work together and share equally.
The **Eight Families** received equal rewards,
with no surplus or deficiency—
this was the governance of the left tally,
allowing others to take without concern for their virtue or malice.

Thus, those who govern the **Dao** of the tally
do not calculate others’ virtue or malice,
while those who govern the **Dao** of passing through
scheme to force transactions.
Reconciling grudges fears the virtuous may suffer,
but even with good intentions,
it resembles the governance of passing through—
those who assist the weak fear their rewards will be meager.

**A small state with few people:**
Though they have war chariots and weapons of a hundred kinds,
they do not use them.
Though they have ships and carriages,
they have no place to ride in them.
Though they have armor and arms,
they have no place to display them.
Let the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping,
enjoy simple food, wear beautiful clothes,
live in comfortable homes,
and delight in their customs.
Though neighboring states are close enough to hear the cocks crow and dogs bark,
the people grow old and die without ever visiting each other.

**【Han Book Annotation:** *The emperor’s decree orders officials’ residences not to place household goods (什器). Yán Shīgū’s note explains that five people form a *wǔ* (伍), ten a *shí* (什), and they share tools, hence "什物" refers to household goods. "Not using them" means avoiding unnecessary travel and labor. Though they have ships and carriages, they do not ride in them—avoiding transport and commerce. Though they have armor and arms, they do not display them—avoiding military conflict. "The people grow old and die without ever visiting each other" implies self-sufficiency, so that there is no need for mutual aid or borrowing. When the **Dao** is complete, there are no affairs to attend to. When resources are abundant, there is no need for mutual aid or borrowing.* **】**

**【Sū’s Annotation:】**
Lǎozǐ was born in the declining years of the Western Zhōu,
when cultural refinement was at its peak and corruption was imminent.
He wrote this to advocate **non-action (无为)** as a means of salvation.
At the end of the text, he expresses his ideal:
*"If only one could attain a small state with few people!"*
This was his earnest hope—
though unattainable, it serves as a model to emulate.
When the people each find contentment in their allotted roles,
even those with modest talents do not seek worldly use,
and those who can manage a hundred *shí* or *bǎi* (什伯) people
are capable of leading a hundred or a thousand households.
**【什伯 (shí-bǎi):** *a hundred or a thousand, emphasizing modest scale.* **】**」

When governance is simple and the people are unspoiled,
even knotted cords suffice for record-keeping.
Content within, they covet nothing beyond—
thus they deem their possessions as beauty,
their abodes as joy, and seek no more.
When the people and their needs are abundant yet unclaimed,
each finds sufficiency in the other—
this is why they lack want.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
From the Three Dynasties onward, until the decline of the Zhou,
refinement and ornamentation grew extreme.
The people lost their natural way of life,
so Laozi’s words seek to restore simplicity,
to return to the governance of ancient times.
In small states with few people,
there are implements for a hundred or a thousand,
yet they remain unused.
The people hold death dear and do not wander far—
though chariots and arms exist, they have no use for them.
This is the restoration of simplicity,
a return to the **Dao of the most ancient age**.

Zhuang Zhou spoke of the age of **ultimate virtue** thus:
*"In the time of Róngchéng, Dàtíng, Bóhuáng, Zhōngyāng,
Lùlù, Líxù, Xuānyuán, Hèxiū, Zūnlú, Zhùróng, Fúxī,
and Shénnóng—
when the people used knotted cords for record-keeping,
they found their food sweet, their garments fine,
their customs joyful, their dwellings secure,
and neighboring lands so near that roosters and dogs’ barks could be heard.
The people lived to old age without traveling far—
such was the state of affairs.
This was not merely Laozi’s vision alone;
ancient times truly knew this **Dao** as well.
Yet the *Shī* and *Shū* speak only of Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties,
while Laozi sought to restore the governance of the most ancient age—
why so?
For the **Dao** and the world have long obstructed each other.
Only the **Great Dao** can return people to their natural way.
To speak of the **Dao** without reference to its age
is insufficient to grasp the **Dao’s** proven worth—
this is why one must return to the governance of the most ancient age.

Yet the world has long since departed from the most ancient age.

Can the **Dao** thus be fully restored?
*"No,"* it replies. *"Then what is its purpose?"*
*"Ritual reaches its fullness in the combined rites of the Three Kings,
music in the complete traditions of the Six Dynasties—
their forms are perfected.
Yet ritual does not place the *shāngshuǐ* [sacrificial water] and great broths
above the *lǐjiǔ* [sacrificial wine] and harmonized soups,
nor does music layer the *huìguǎn* [reed pipes]’ clear tones
over the *zhūfú* [red silk] and sparse *shūyuè* [slow dances].
This is to make people grasp the essential intent of ritual and music—
what they must abandon is as clear as what they seek to restore.
In such times,
Confucius sought to revive the lost traditions of Wen and Wu, and the Duke of Zhou,
while Laozi’s teachings on the **Dao** and the world shared this same intent.

It is like the moon waxing while fire begins to wane,
and the *jīn* [metal] *qi* already stirring between them—
this is how the Five Phases succeed one another without interruption.
Thus, though ancient governance had myriad implements,
they were not employed;
though chariots and armor existed,
they were not used in battle.
Only when great undertakings required great assemblies
was it necessary.
Hearing of the people using knotted cords for record-keeping,
neighboring lands within earshot of roosters and dogs,
living to old age without travel—
this was the simplicity before elaborate rites, exhausting decrees,
and the relentless scrutiny of officials.
Footprints pressed the fields, and cart-ruts marked the roads,
while distant lands were reached only when unavoidable—
what was unavoidable was always here,
yet what was sought to restore was always there.

Would they then weary themselves with excessive governance,
deepening the people’s faults?
Yet if the world cannot achieve lasting peace and ease,
then even in death, they speak no more—
as if they had discarded the *shāngshuǐ* and abandoned the *shūyuè*,
who would know that ritual’s frugality and music’s restraint
were the very essence of returning to origins and beginning anew?

The words of the sages—
are they not profound in their intent?"*

The Way of the small state with few people—
then the people are pure and simple.
Indeed, the larger the state, the more the people,
and the more their interests clash and cunning deceits arise.
The customs of those in cities and villages differ greatly—
this is the proof of it.

In a world without the Dao/Way,
the people are poor, the land barren,
and desires for profit prevail.
The love of life grows weak while its roots decay,
and greed for gain is ever-present.
They admire distant lands yet fear the law,
treading perilous paths as if on level ground,
while cart-ruts and footprints crisscross everywhere—
the four quarters are traversed.
If they delight in life and follow their nature,
they will fear death and cling to their land;
if they seek no gain, they will not wander far—
this is the very governance of fulfilling their nature,
and the people fulfill their own nature as well.

I have pondered the *Lunyu* and the *Mengzi*—
both conclude with praise of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang,
the deeds of the sages.
If one takes this book and applies its governance,
its effects may be as such.

Laozi was a great sage,
yet the changes he faced aligned with the time
when returning to origins and fulfilling nature was paramount.
Thus, he alone illuminated the intent of *Dao* and *virtue/power*,
to gather and unify the scattered,
to restore simplicity and sincerity.
If one takes his book and applies its governance,
the people will be transformed and customs refined—
this is the effect of this chapter.
Hence, the meaning of the *Classic* is fulfilled in it.

The governance of ten as a *shí* and a hundred as a *bǎi*—
these are heavy instruments, great tools shared by the multitude.
If unused, they are not cultivated—
this is the absence of greed for heavy instruments without purpose.
To hold death in reverence is to treat death as weighty,
while cherishing life in its duties—
to not wander far is to be rooted here, to die here,
and not seek elsewhere.
Laozi sought to reverse the decline of Zhou,
restoring the simplicity of ancient times.
A great state means many people, difficult to govern;
a small state with few people is easier to rule,
so that its people do not covet the outside
but find sufficiency within.
Thus, they do not stray.

Boats, chariots, armor, and weapons—
no single person can wield them alone;
these are the *shí* and *bǎi* instruments.
If there is nothing to ride upon, nothing to array,
then they are unused.
If there is nowhere to go, then they serve no purpose.
If there is no contention over boats and carriages,
then they are of no use.
If the people are pure and affairs are simple,
the governance of ancient knotted cords may be restored—
even if writing and contracts exist, they may be dispensed with.
Not only are the *shí* and *bǎi* instruments unused,
but the food they eat is sweet,
the clothes they wear are beautiful,
and they are naturally content,
cherishing life—
this is the meaning of holding death in reverence.
They take this place as their home and find comfort in it,
this land’s customs as their joy—
who would lightly abandon it to wander far?
The people cling to their soil;
even neighboring states are visible to the eye,
their roosters and dogs audible to the ear—
yet they do not visit one another,
let alone wander far.

Truthful words are not beautiful;
beautiful words are not truthful.
Good words are not persuasive;
persuasive words are not good.
The wise are not erudite;
the erudite are not wise.
The sage does not accumulate—
the more he gives to others, the more he possesses;
the more he bestows, the more he has.
The Way of Heaven benefits without harming;
the sage’s Way acts without contending.

---
**Su’s Commentary:**
Truth is substance alone—
beauty is mere appearance.
Goodness as the foundation does not seek eloquence;
eloquence as the foundation is not necessarily good.
One principle unifies all—
the erudite accumulate knowledge daily but may not grasp the Dao.
The sage holds to unity alone;
what need has he of accumulation?
Only because he lacks accumulation
does he become one with all things—
thus, he is supremely rich.
If he were to accumulate,
his resources would be finite,
and how could he ever possess more?
Laozi’s words:
Within, he observes the heart;
without, he observes things;
above, he observes Heaven;
below, he observes Earth—
all in harmony.
Yet the vulgar hear and scoff,
the world deems him foolish—
this is not beauty.
His words are closest yet point farthest—
this is goodness,
yet he does not speak for pleasure—
this is not eloquence.
His wisdom reaches the realm of non-wisdom,
yet remains unbroken—
this is knowledge,
yet does not stray from the heart—
this is not erudition.
But scholars seek beauty, eloquence, and erudition—
they stray from the Dao.
Laozi’s Way rejects accumulation;
even the sage abandons it.
Thus, in utter emptiness,
he fulfills all demands—
the more he possesses, the more he gives.
Yet scholars, unable to carve their hearts,
cannot attain this.

All things have benefits and harms;
where there is harm, there is injury.
Only the Way of Heaven benefits without harming—
where there is no benefit, there is no harm.
All things that act do so with self-interest;
self-interest breeds contention.
The sage’s Way acts yet does not act—
without action, there is no self;
without self, there is no contention.
This is the Way of Heaven.

---
**Lü’s Commentary:**
The Dao is a thing unseen when gazed upon,
unheard when listened to,
untouched when grasped—
it can be silently understood but not sought through reasoning.
Thus, truthful words are true to this alone—
what need for beauty?
Good words are good to this alone—
what need for eloquence?
Persuasive words are persuasive to this alone—
what need for cleverness?
Erudite words are erudite to this alone—
what need for breadth?
From this, it is clear:
beauty is not truth,
eloquence is not goodness,
erudition is not wisdom.
The Dao was never a thing in the first place.
The sage merges with the Dao—
what accumulation could he have?
Only because he lacks accumulation
does he become one with all things—
thus, he is supremely rich.
If he were to accumulate,
his resources would be exhausted,
and how could he ever possess more?
Laozi’s words:
Within, he observes the heart;
without, he observes things;
above, he observes Heaven;
below, he observes Earth—
all in harmony.
Yet the vulgar hear and scoff,
the world deems him foolish—
this is not beauty.

without self, there is no contention.
This is the Way of Heaven.

---
**Bǐ Shèng’s Note:**
Some say that Laozi’s book
allows one to receive and savor it—
this is near to beauty.
It exhausts the principles of all things without omission—
this is near to goodness.

The discerning observer marks all things’ transformations without omission—
this is near to mastery.

Yet those who are vast yet lack sincerity,
who are clever yet not virtuous,
who are learned yet not profound,
who are erudite yet not wise—
what use are they?

For the Five Thousand Words speak only of the Way of non-accumulation.
Non-accumulation means the heart dwells nowhere.

To accumulate yet not accumulate—
this is to speak yet not speak.
To speak yet not speak is not to withhold from others,
yet never to claim possession for oneself.
To never diminish one’s abundance—
how could this be faulted for being argumentative or overreaching?

If one does not follow the Way of non-accumulation
but clings to rigid opinions and contends with the world,
then many words will lead to exhaustion—
this is not the Heavenly Way.

The Heavenly Way benefits without harming;
the sage’s Way acts without contention.
Scholars who carve their hearts here
have already grasped half of Laozi’s teaching.

Thus it is said:
To teach without teaching—
why seal the mouth at *Pīyé*?
To guard speech is already to clarify the heart.
To those reading beneath the pillars—
strive diligently!

The *Records of the Historian*’s *Biography of Laozi* states:

Laozi was a man of **Qū County**, **Lì Xiàng**, in **Kǔ Prefecture**—his clan name was **Lǐ**, given name **Ēr**, with the courtesy name **Bóyáng**, posthumously titled **Dān**. He served as the **Keeper of the Royal Archives** in **Zhōu**. When **Kǒngzǐ** traveled to **Zhōu** to inquire about rites, Laozi said:

*“What you speak of—both the man and his bones—are long since decayed. Only his words remain. Moreover, a gentleman who finds his time may ride in a carriage; if he does not, he walks with a staff. I have heard that a skilled merchant conceals his goods as if empty, while a gentleman of virtue appears humble yet is profound. Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your lustful expressions and licentious thoughts—these bring no benefit to your body. This is all I have to tell you.”*

Kǒngzǐ departed and told his disciples:
*“I know how birds fly and fish swim, how beasts run. Those that run can be trapped, those that swim can be snared, those that fly can be caught in nets. But as for the dragon—I cannot fathom how it rides the winds and clouds to ascend to heaven. Today, I have seen Laozi—he is like the dragon!”*

Laozi cultivated **virtue and the Way**, making **self-effacement and namelessness** his pursuit. After long residence in **Zhōu**, seeing its decline, he departed. At the **Guān Pass**, the **Prime Minister of Guān**, **Xǐ**, said:
*“Master, you are about to withdraw. Please write a book for me.”*
Thus Laozi composed the *Book of the Way and Virtue* in two sections, totaling over five thousand words, before departing. No one knows his ultimate fate. Some say **Lǎolǎizǐ** was also from **Chǔ**, having written fifteen treatises on **Daoist practice**, contemporary with **Kǒngzǐ**. It is said Laozi lived over a hundred and sixty years—or even over two hundred—due to his cultivation of the **Way** and longevity.

After **Kǒngzǐ’s** death, one hundred and twenty-nine years later, the **Grand Historian of Zhōu**, **Dàn**, reported to **Qín Xiàn Gōng**:
*“When **Qín** first separated from **Zhōu**, it was a union of five hundred years. After seven decades, a ruler will arise to dominate.”*
Some say **Dàn** was Laozi; others deny it. The world knows not the truth.

Laozi was a **hidden sage**. His son, **Zōng**, served as a general for **Wèi** and was ennobled at **Duàn Gàn**. **Zōng’s** descendant, **Zhù**, had a son, **Jǐa**, who served under **Hàn Xiào Wén Dì**. **Jǐa’s** son, **Jiě**, became the **Tutor of Jiāoxī Wáng Àn**, and his family settled in **Qí**. Those who studied Laozi disparaged **Confucianism**, while Confucians likewise disparaged Laozi. Their **Dao** differed, and they did not seek mutual understanding—was this not so?

**Lǐ Ēr**—**self-so without action, pure and self-regulating**.

The **Stele of Laozi’s Temple** by **Xuē Dàohéng** of the **Sui** reads:

From the **Great Ultimate’s** transformation, the **Primordial Void** emerged. At the **Opening of the Myriad Things**, the **Celestial Pivot** was suspended, and the sun and moon were arrayed. The **Earthly Axis** was established, bearing mountains and rivers. The **breath of yin and yang**, in its **expansion and contraction**, gave rise to all things—**spirits above, life below**. The **climates and seasons** were thus ordained, nurturing the **ten thousand beings**, granting **people and rulers** their place.

The **Ancient Sovereign** observed the **ancient ways**: in summer, he dwelled in high halls; in winter, in deep caves. He quieted his mind, refined his wisdom, and dwelled in simplicity. His **great rites** harmonized with **Heaven and Earth**; his **music** resonated with the **cosmic order**. How could he be constrained by **sacrificial vessels** or **musical instruments**?

When the **Way declined**, **virtue waned**; when **virtue declined**, **benevolence faltered**. Rulers and peoples differed in their **steps and customs**, their **manners pure or corrupt**. Thus, **Confucians and Mohists** vied for fame, **Legalists** raced in their schemes, and though the **Three Hundred Rites** could not restrain human nature, nor the **Three Thousand Penal Codes** suppress their deceit—
how then could one **clarify the currents** without **purifying the source**, or **straighten the branches** without **rectifying the root**? Only the **Great Dao** suffices as the **source and root**.

Laozi, sensing the **celestial mandate**, was born of **mysterious origin**, his lineage traced to a **tree**—his surname unclear. His **birth was marked by the **Lü harmonics**, his **pregnancy held divine essence**. At over seventy years, he was born with **white hair**, thus taking the name **Laozi**. His form was strange:
—**Three gates**, **double pillars**, **ears like a dragon’s**,
—**eyes like a **qi**-creature’s**, **limbs like a **five-clawed beast’s**,
—**hands and feet of ten forms**, **unlike ordinary men**.
From **Fúxī** to the **Zhōu Dynasty**, through successive ages, his **substance remained unchanged**, his name recorded in the **Book of Changes**. In the time of **Wén Wáng** and **Wǔ Wáng**, he held the office of **Keeper of the Archives** and **Pillar Historian**, often altering his appearance without revealing his true form. When **Kǒngzǐ** glimpsed him, he sighed:
*“The **Dragon Virtue** is hard to know!”*
When **Guān Yīn Xǐ** gazed upon him from afar, he recognized the **True Person** about to withdraw, and thus Laozi expounded his **profound mysteries**, writing two treatises. He returned to his **natural Way**, using **non-action** as his method. His words were **concise yet profound**, his **defenses deep and far-reaching**. Even the **Flying Dragon’s** transformations could not compare to his **refinement**; the **Lynx’s** pen could not match his **luminous insight**. Whether **bright or hidden**, his **application**—
when used for **self-cultivation**, brought **clarity of spirit and tranquility of mind**;
when applied to **governance**, restored **simplicity and purity**.

Later, he **transcended form**, his **traces vanished**, his **outer shell shed**. In **recluses’ robes**, he rode a **crane**, coming and going between the **Purple Palace** and **Jīn Jiāng**, partaking of **jade nectar and immortal wine**. His **luster rivaled the sun and moon**, his **beginning and end** one with **Heaven and Earth**. Those who followed his **teachings** cast off **worldly dust**; those who entered his **gates** soared on **clouds and mists**. The **Great Chūn** withered yet revived—how could the **mayfly** comprehend it? The **boundless depths**—how could **Yún Yí** fathom them?

**Grand indeed!** Yet without **virtue**, how could he be thus extolled?

**Zhuāngzǐ** said:
*“When **Lǎodān** died, **Qín Yì** wept for him, thrice wailing before departing—this was called the **Form of the Heavenly Retreat**. Though it was but a **mockery of officials**, it was also the **subtle transformation of a cicada’s molt**.”

The **Emperor’s** sacred birth—
his **august virtue** shone like the **red comet** at **Chōnglíng**, the **purple gas** of **Mángshān**. His **jewel-like horns** and **moon-angled brow** surpassed all **ancient kings**. His **mirror-like clarity** and **vessel-like purity** endured for **thousands of years**. The **Zhōu Way** declined in its **late age**, its **nine tripods** submerged, its **waters mingling with the sea**. Two suns rose, and **Lòchūan** battled in the **Lò River**. The **Heavenly Pivot** tilted; the **Earthly Axis** wavered. **Snakes devoured copper**, **whales swallowed jade**—in the lands of **Tónglíng** and **Yùlěi**, **wolves howled**, **owls perched**, **delusion spread**, and **poisonous calumny** festered. **Divine schemes** arose within, **military expeditions** without. **Opposing armies clashed**; **weapons clashed**; **Jiāng Yóu** was slain, **Chīyóu** executed. The **Heavenly Pivot** was restored, the **Earthly Axis** righted—**Gōnggōng** was cut down, **Yóuzhōu** destroyed. The **winds and rains** were regulated; **creation and transformation** were governed. The **myriad creatures** rejoiced, their **souls and spirits** blessed. The **nine regions** sang in praise, and the **five directions** responded in harmony.

The **Heavenly Son** ascended the **Tái Platform** to worship **Heaven**, seated in the **Míng Hall** to receive the **clan leaders**. In ancient times, **Xuānyuán** and **Zhuānxū** established their **kingdoms differently**; **Dàhào** and **Shàohào** marked their **boundaries distinct**. **Shùn** altered **Yáo’s** capital; **Yù** moved the **Yú domain**. Selecting the **former sages**, he **preserved their institutions**, cherishing the **ten thousand families**, loving the **myriad peoples**, and **initiating the Imperial Residence**. The **Celestial Treasury’s** layout followed the **Purple Extremity**, adhering to the **Sovereign’s Plan**. The **upper eaves** were low, the **foundations** firm—**left and right** aligned with **equality and rectitude**. The **morning and evening halls** were unified; the **Yuānluán Tower** rose without **crane-like scaffolding**. **Laborious governance** and **benevolent care** nurtured the people. In **sleep and waking**, he pondered their **suffering**; his **heart ached like thorny forests**, his **stones wept**. He **bestowed grace**, **pardoned crimes**, and **simplified rituals**. His **garments bore no shame**; his **deeds knew no guilt**. **Heaven’s** **unenterable star** did not descend; **Earth’s** **city-destroying ox** did not rise. The **Grand Hall** was expanded, the **inner precincts** examined. **Classics were compiled**; the **Shíqú Jade Water** was unearthed. **Confucian learning** was revived; the **Five Rites**, on the verge of collapse, were restored. The **Six Musics**, already lost, were rectified. The **songs of drowned ambition** and **celebrations of merit** were composed. The **Double Suns** shone brightly; the **eternal light** endured. The **foundations were firm**; the **lineage was exalted**. The **vessels of state** were secure as **mountains of jade**. **Talented ministers** flourished; **treasured officials** were **cultivated in virtue and martial skill**, serving as the **kingdom’s bulwark** and the **transcendent’s brushstroke**.

The **Xióngnú** and **Dí** had long been a **menace**, their **claws and fangs** sharp.

The **unexcelled stratagems** were employed to govern it,
Yet the **lowest tactics** were the most difficult to subdue.
Self-generated fortune shone with **virtue**,
Arms were restrained, **merit** was felt, **benevolence** was embraced.
**Vassal states** acknowledged their **tribute obligations**,
**Kneeling in submission**, bowing in homage—
**Night郎** and **Mò** were swept away,
**Sāngyú** and **Lǐ** lands all came under **Dharma’s influence**.
The **Fúyú** and **Mǐnyuè**, **Gōuwú** alike,
Never failed in their **tribute duties**—
**My** own **Xióngnú** and **Dí** were tamed,
**Barbarian courts** stood without interruption, near and far.
**Sacrificial rites** were refined,
**The Great Harmony** was cultivated—
Since the **Three Dynasties** and the **Six Warlords**,
Who vied in **strife and conquest**:
**Qín** held the **intercalary throne**,
**Hàn** mingled **hegemony** with **wayward paths**,
**Wéi** brought **tyranny** deep,
**Jìn** restored **civilization**—
Thus, **barbarians and Chinese** became indistinct,
**Imperial traces** and **royal winds** faded into silence.
A thousand years passed in **celestial mandate’s** stillness,
**Sacred virtue** stood firm, **prosperity** and **auspice** endured.
**Divine Way** transformed the **people’s** perception,
Reestablishing the **Three Five** order.

**Yīng** and **Míng** were harmonized in **auspicious resonance**,
**Celestial omens** shone forth in **divine brilliance**—
Like the **three-legged crow** taking flight,
Or the **solar essence** manifesting in form.
**Spring waters** flowed as **sacred wine** from the **capital’s** heart,
**Autumn dews** condensed sweet, spreading through **bamboo and reeds**.
**Stellar light** like the moon,
**Cloud-qi** rising as **flying mist**—
The **three harvests** answered the **bronze bell’s** call,
The **five stars** followed the **pearl pouch’s** measure.

**Harmony** could be **proclaimed**,
**Processions** could move—
**Southern sacrifices** to **Fire**, **Fire’s** rites to **God**,
Yet still the **rituals** feared disorder,
**Ancestral altars** were left unrefined.
**Eternal benevolence** was spoken of,
**Longevity** was sought in the **sacred precincts**—
**Deer and antelope** shifted in reverence,
**The Azure Pavilion** stood in **serene majesty**.
**Pillars and beams** were carved with **divine precision**,
**Roofs and eaves** painted in **celestial splendor**,
**Square wells and circular ponds** aligned in **geometric grace**,
**Statues and halls** rose in **mutual support**.
**The sovereign’s likeness** was **revered** in **solemn stillness**,
**Divine chambers** remained **unoccupied**, yet **auspicious**—
**Dripping blessings** fell as **echoing response**,
**Pure-hearted, clean-minded** scholars preserved **unity’s** companions.
From **four directions**, **thousands gathered** in **respectful homage**,
**Sacrificial rites** were solemnly offered,
**Ren’s** aid was **displayed** to the **king**,
**Ming’s** fortune was **bestowed** upon the **people**.

This is the **Great Dao**—
Great in **name**, great in **stratagem**,
Yet **difficult to guard** against its **transcendence**.

If **eloquent words** were abruptly silenced,
**Hidden springs** left unopened—
**Forms and instruments** unexhibited,
**Divine marvels** left unmanifest—
**Heroic deeds** would not ascend to **Danqing’s** brush,
**Bright reputations** would not be **engraved** on **gold and stone**,
And yet—what **harmony** could this be?

In the **year of Dūncháng**,
**Lǜzhōng** was **purified**,
**Great Sui** ruled the **land** for **six years**—

The decree was issued to the subject to erect a stele and compose an ode in praise thereof:

*"Ah, vast and ancient beyond reckoning!*
The Emperor’s forebears, four generations past,
Sustained the earth’s eight pillars, upheld the heavens’ clusters,
Gathered the myriad streams, shaped the great valleys and rivers.
The **Dao’s** numinous workings, the **Way’s** spontaneous virtue—
The Five Agents responded in kind, the Three **Precepts** succeeded in turn,
Establishing **guardians** to tend the people, wielding their **symbols** in accord.
The **Emperor’s** traces surpass the **August** and **Sovereign**—
His **virtue** transcends the distant, yet pure customs fade,
The times grow askew, the **Dao** of simplicity lost,
The people’s ways diverge—**harmony** and **virtue** now rare.
**Cunning** and **craft** are prized, **law** and **net** are set,
The fish are startled, the birds take flight—
**Weapons** multiply, the **Way** declines.

Then came the **True Person**, descending from the stars,
His **virtue** like the **Dragon’s**—blessed in person,
His **qi** as the **Crane’s**—bowed in humility.
He dispelled strife, blunted sharpness,
Rejected the thin, embraced the substantial,
His **virtue** like the **horns of the sun and moon**—
Enduring as heaven and earth.

Now, though this be but one of the Five **Sacred Peaks**,
A mere corner of the Nine **Provinces**—
Yet he would soar aloft, transcend the mundane,
And ride the **Blue Ox** into the distance.
**Purple vapors** rise, the **Way’s** gate opens wide,
Its **transformations** flow unseen—
Yet rooted in the old homeland, the **Luo River’s** legacy,
Ancient traces from past to present,
As time shifts and the world changes—
The **spirit-temples** decay, the **shrine-altars** lie empty,
The Nine **Wells** sprout **paulownia**, the twin steles crumble to stone.

Now the **August One** receives the **Mandate**—
**Divine** and **Sage** alike!
The earth resounds, the **celestial bell** tolls,
The **heavenly mirror** hangs suspended—
The cosmos clears, the **demonic mists** disperse,
The **luminous essence** aligns in reverence,
The **sacred** and **profound** take their rightful place.
The **flowing sands** coil, the **phoenix’s** nest is sealed,
The **strange trees** return, the **clusters** converge—
Ten thousand lands find their home,
Their hearts united in **harmony**.
The **Royal Master of Ceremonies** receives the **tribute**,
The **King’s** **precepts** are inscribed, the **treasures** laid out.
The **fragrant winds** waft through the **chamber**, the **music** resounds—
The **cauldron** is balanced, the **house** prospers,
**Rites** and **deference** endure eternally.

Even beneath the **pillars**, I am ashamed to compare myself to the **August Ancestors**.
Thus, a **pure shrine** is erected, its **diagrams** drawn,
Its **spirit-forms** mapped—
Across the **level fields** and **lofty mounds**,
The **meadows** stretch far, the **plum and cassia** beams rise,
The **curved eaves** and **clustered pillars** stand,
As **mist and cloud** drift, **wind and rain** weep—
**Celestial officials** take their stations,
**Feathered guests** arrive in procession.
Abundant blessings descend, the **bright and numinous** manifest—
Their **logic** is unfathomable, yet their **symbols** endure,
Their **great sound** is rare, their **high resonance** echoes far.
Near and distant alike offer praise,
To the **profound** and **luminous**—
That all may revere and uplift,
Their names **engraved on gold and stone**,
To be spread through heaven and earth.

With reverence, I, **Respectful Chú**, the descendant of **Companion Zhòng**,
**Companion Zhòng** having said to **Rú’s lord**:
*"Confucius, the **Sage’s** heir,
One who would attain the **Way**—
I have heard that **Lǎo Dān** was learned in antiquity,
Mastered the present, fathomed the **origins of rites and music**,
Clarified the **return of virtue and the Dao**—
He is my **Teacher**."*

**Respectful Chú** spoke to **Rú’s lord**:
*"Kǒng Qiū, the **Sage’s** descendant,
One who would attain the **Way**—"*

「To fulfill the command of my predecessor, I must necessarily follow his teachings. Now, Confucius is about to journey to the Zhou, to observe the institutions of the ancient kings and examine the ultimate refinements of rites and music—this is a grand undertaking. My lord, why not grant him a carriage and attendants to aid his way? I beg to accompany him.»

**Rú’s lord** granted him a carriage with one pair of horses and two attendants, and **Respectful Chú** went with him to the Zhou. There, they inquired about **rites** from **Lǎo Dān** and about **music** from **Cháng Yǐng**. They surveyed the **sacrificial grounds** and **ancestral temples**, examined the **Hall of Clear Clarity** and its **four gates**, and observed the **walls of the hall**—where were the **symbols** of **Yáo**, **Shùn**, **Jié**, and **Zhòu**—each bearing marks of **good and evil**, **rise and ruin**, as warnings.

Moreover, there was the **image** of **Zhōu Gōng** assisting **Chéng Wáng**, holding him and bearing the **axe-hilt banner**, facing south to receive the **tribute of the feudal lords**. **Respectful Chú** sighed, *"Now I understand **Zhōu Gōng’s** sagehood and the reason **Zhōu** came to rule!"*

As they departed the Zhou, **Lǎo Dān** sent them off, saying, *"The wealthy give gifts with wealth, the virtuous give gifts with words. I claim the name of the virtuous and give you words: Those who live in this age, though clever and profound, are near to death. They delight in criticizing others’ faults. Those who are broad in debate and vast in knowledge risk endangering themselves by exposing others’ flaws. As ministers, they cannot bear to have their own opinions; as sons, they cannot bear to have their own desires. When I return from the Zhou, the **Way** will grow ever more revered. The distant disciples who come to me number three thousand!"*

Confucius sighed, *"Since **Respectful Chú** rode in my carriage, my **Way** has gained momentum. Otherwise, my **Way** would have been lost!"*

The *Records of Rites* that are cited today—what I heard from **Lǎo Dān**—are all from Confucius’ inquiries with **Lǎo Dān** about the essentials of **rites**.

**Wáng Zǐ Nián**, in his *Lost Records*, wrote that **Lǎo Jūn** dwelled on **Jǐng Shì** Mountain, cutting himself off from the world. Only five old men visited him: sometimes riding on **crying cranes**, sometimes clad in **feathered robes**. Together, they discussed the **numbers of heaven and earth**. The **scriptures** he composed amounted to over **ten thousand words**. In the **Fú Tí** Kingdom, two men offered **books of good deeds**—now old, now young, their forms shifting. When unseen, their shadows appeared; when their voices were heard, their forms vanished. At times, they emerged from a **golden vessel** containing a black substance like **primeval lacquer**, which they sprinkled on trees and stones, transforming them into **inscribed characters** and **divine diagrams**, recording the **beginning of creation and human relations**.

All the **scriptures** of **Lǎo Jūn** were written on **jade tablets**, bound with **gold cords**, and stored in **jade cases** and **golden vessels**. When the black substance was exhausted, the two men wished to **carve their hearts and drain their blood** to replace it. This is what was spoken of in the **Lǎo** and **Shào** Mountains of **Luó Zhōu**—the **Nine Transformations** and **Longevity** **scriptures**, numbering over **a hundred thousand** **volumes**, hidden in mountain caves and stone chambers, unrevealed until now. About **six thousand volumes** have emerged.

**Guān Yǐn Zǐ**, **Yǐn Xǐ**, served under **Zhāo Wáng** of the Zhou as a **great official**, skilled in **celestial omens** and **divination**. He foresaw the **True Qi** of the east and south, appearing like **dragon and snake**, and the **fusion of wind and moon**, the **threefold unfolding of heaven’s principles**. When he journeyed westward, he knew there was a **sage** who would **cross the Pass**. He begged to be allowed to leave his post as **Kuan Pass Keeper** and **Zhāo Wáng** granted it. In the **fifth month of the year Gǔ Chǒu**, on a **day Rén Wǔ**, a **purple vapor** rose in the sky. An **old man** drove a **green ox**, pulling a **white carriage**, with disciples following behind. **Xǐ** welcomed him and bowed in reverence. The **wind of respect** was **Lǎo Zǐ**.

**Xǐ** said, *"The **Great Way** is about to vanish. Forcefully, he has written a book for me."* He lodged at the **Southern Pavilion** of **Zhōng Nán** Mountain and studied under him. The next year, in **Jiā Yín**, he received the **Five Thousand Words** of **Virtue and the Dao**, encompassing **heaven and earth**, **creation and transformation**, **sovereigns and subjects**, **people and things**—none were left out. He exalted the **Virtue and the Dao**, placing **rites and rightness** below them, thus honoring the **Emperor of Heaven** and placing lesser **feudal lords** beneath him. In essence, it was about **clarifying the Way of Heaven**, **clarifying the Way of humanity**, **rectifying the heart of the ruler**, and **rectifying the hearts of the people**. He said, *"To govern the state with **rectitude**, to employ **strategy** in warfare."* He also spoke of the **"Left General"** and **"Right General"**—in all, several chapters with **praise and blame** of the **Five Lords**. Scholars doubt whether **Zhāo Wáng** had yet achieved lordship or if this was during the reign of **Jìng Wáng**. But the decline of **Xià** and **Shāng** had already begun, and **Kūn Wú** and **Dà Píng** had even proclaimed themselves **lords**. **Zhāo Wáng’s** refusal to return to the **Jiāng** River was no longer awaiting the rise of **Qí**, **Chǔ**, **Xīn**, and **Jìn**. The **lords’** influence had already appeared.

This is how **Lǎo Zǐ** and the **sage** composed the **scriptures** on **Virtue and the Dao**, integrating their **efforts and powers**.

According to the *Records*, the **Three Stars** of **Xiàng** (the **North Star**) and **Hé** (the **Milky Way**) govern the **son of heaven** and the **three armies**. The **central star** is the **great general**; the **left star** is the **left general**; the **right star** is the **right general**. The **Summer Office** and the **upper great marshal** are also mentioned in the *Institutes of Zhou* and the *Inner Teachings of King Mù*. It is clear that the transmission of the **scriptures** occurred during **Zhāo Wáng’s** time when he ascended to **Zhōng Nán** and built the **grass pavilion**.

**Guān Yǐn Zǐ** also wrote **nine chapters**, titled *Guān Yǐn Zǐ*. His disciple, **Jìn Gōng Sūn Xīn**, with the courtesy name **Jì Rán**, studied under **Lǎo Zǐ**. In the **second year of Jìng Wáng** (on a day **Rén Wǔ**), he traveled south to **Chǔ**, where **Píng Wáng** honored and invited him, seeking his teachings. Later, he went to **Yuè**, where **Fàn Lì** became his disciple. **Jì Rán** taught him, and **Lì** wrote **twelve chapters**, titled *Wén Zǐ*. Among them was **Píng Wáng’s** inquiry, recorded in **sentences and phrases**. When **Lì** ascended the throne as a **duke**, he appointed **Jì Rán** as a **great official**. Later, when **Yuè** attacked **Wú**, **Lì** advised, *"War is a cruel instrument; battle goes against **virtue**. Secret plots go against **virtue**. Those who delight in cruel instruments and secret plots—**Heaven’s Highest** forbids them. This will not succeed."* He quoted the words of *Wén Zǐ*.

**Lì** did not listen and was defeated at **Fú Jiāo**, imprisoned in the **Stone Chamber**. He bribed **Tài Shǐ Pí** and returned home. He tasted **gall** to steel his resolve and plotted revenge against **Wú**. Later, he consulted **Jì Rán**, who said, *"**Gōu Jiàn** has a long neck and raven’s beak. He can share calamity but not prosperity."* **Lì** followed his strategy, fleeing to the **Five Lakes**. **Jì Rán** also pretended madness and withdrew to **Fēng Yú**, where he once climbed a mountain to plan his escape. Now, the **Jiàn Cǎo** Mountain in **Wú Xìng** is where he did so.

**Liè Yù**, dwelling in **Jìng** for **forty years**, was unknown to the people. In the **fourth year of Ān Wáng**, he wrote **eight chapters**, expounding **Lǎo Zǐ’s Way**. **Zhuāng Zhōu**, with the courtesy name **Nán Huá Zǐ**, served in the **thirtieth year of Xiǎn Wáng** of **Chǔ**, but declined the appointment as **prime minister** and hid at the **Háo** River’s **Lacquer Garden**. He wrote **fifty-three chapters**, titled *Zhuāng Zǐ*. Now, **thirty-three chapters** remain.

As for **Gēng Sāng**, **Chǔ Nán Hóng**, **Zhuī**, **Zhuì**, **Bó Jǔ**, **Shì Chéng**, **Qǐ Yǐn**, and **Wén Zǐ’s** disciples, all were contemporaries who studied under **Lǎo Zǐ** and transmitted his teachings, each leaving behind their own writings recorded in the **classics**. Yet **Lǎo Zǐ** had already traveled extensively through **Shāng** and **Zhōu** for a long time. Those who personally saw him were like **Yóu Lóng**—as for **Confucius**, he alone could be said to have done so.

Since **Sī Mǎ Qiān**, **Lǎo** and **Hàn** have been conflated in their transmission, and **Lǎo Zǐ’s** disciples have been lost to history. Thus, the **shared teachings** of **Confucius** and **Lǎo Zǐ** have not been passed down to later generations.

Alas! The title of **"scriptures"** for **Lǎo Zǐ’s** teachings began with **Hàn Jǐng Dì**. **Wú Qián Zé** addressed the **Emperor**, saying, *"Xǔ Chéng Zǐ, **Yuán Yáng Zǐ**, **Lǎo Zǐ**, and **Zhuāng Zǐ** all cultivated their **virtue**, indulged in **self-pleasure**, and roamed freely in mountains and valleys, letting their **minds** wander. Their learning returned to **simplicity and tranquility**. When **Hàn Jǐng Dì** ascended the throne, he found that **Yellow Emperor’s** and **Lǎo Zǐ’s** teachings were particularly profound. He changed the name from **"master"** to **"scripture"** and established the **Daoist** **teaching system**, commanding all under **heaven** to recite and study them."*

The **Han** scholar **Bān Gòng** recorded that **Lǎo Zǐ’s** teachings were transmitted by the **Fù** lineage (with **37 chapters**), the **Lín** lineage (with **4 chapters**), and the **Xú** lineage (with **6 chapters**), while **Liú Xiàng** also offered his interpretation (with **4 chapters**). Alas! Their books have long since been lost.

Today, the transmitted **Daoist** *Dào Dé Jīng* either comprises **two volumes** (upper and lower) or is divided into **81 chapters** or **72 chapters**. The **Hé Shàng Gōng** version splits it into **81 chapters**: the upper section follows the **Dao of Heaven** (with odd numbers), hence **37 chapters**; the lower section follows the **Dao of Earth** (with even numbers), hence **44 chapters**. **Yán Zhēn** then adjusted it to **8 for the Yin Dao** and **9 for the Yang Dao**, resulting in **72 chapters**: **40 in the upper** and **32 in the lower**—all conflicting with **Hé Shàng Gōng’s** arrangement. Their texts differ, and their commentaries vary; none can be verified.

The **recluse** **Xié Shǒu Hào** (of the **Sòng** dynasty) noted that the *Dào Dé Jīng*, as studied by **Fù Yì** of the **Táng** dynasty, was meticulously examined across multiple versions. He recorded:

- The **Xiàng** lineage’s version (from **Ān Qiú’s** tomb, discovered by **Xiàng Yǔ’s** descendant in the **5th year of Qīng Tíng** (569 CE) under **Emperor Qí Jìng** of **Qí**),
- The **Wèi** lineage’s version (obtained by **Dàojiàn Zhī** in the **Tàihé** era of **Wèi**),
- The **Hé Shàng Zhàngrén** version (transmitted by the **Chǔshì** **Qiú Yùe**),
- The **Shān Yáng** **Wáng Bì** version (with **5,683** or **5,610** characters),
- The **Hé Shàng Gōng** version (with **5,355** or **5,590** characters),
- The **Lùoyáng** official version (with **5,635** characters),
- The **Yán** lineage’s version (with **5,722** characters, matching **Hàn Fēi’s** *Yù Lǎo* in content),
- The **Lǐng** lineage’s version (with **5,722** characters, also aligning with **Hàn Fēi’s** *Yù Lǎo*).

Over the years, these versions diverged as scholars relied on their own transmissions or cross-referenced others, leading to inconsistencies. **Sīmǎ Qiān** stated that **Lǎo Zǐ’s** book, discussing **virtue** and **Dao**, contained **over 5,000 words**, but not exceeding **6,000**, hence **5,000+**. The **Daoist** tradition later generalized this as **5,000 zhang** (a **zhang** being a measure of length, here likely metaphorical for the entire text). **Dù Guāngtíng** remarked that **5,000+ words** was indeterminate, with **half in prose** and **half in verse**, blending **principles** and **practical teachings**. Any attempt to **trim the text** or **force the count** distorts its original intent. **Sīmǎ Qiān’s** claim of **5,000+ words** likely refers to **5,000 characters**, but his assertion that **30 extra characters** were added to reach **5,000** is rigid and unpersuasive—like **binding oneself to a pillar** or **carving a boat** after the fact.

Among the **60+** commentaries, some focus on **sequential explanations** (e.g., **Yín Xǐ’s** *Lǎo Jūn Shí Lù* and his *Internal Modifications*), while others provide **concise interpretations** (e.g., the **Sān Tiān Fǎshī** **Zhāng Dàolíng’s** *Two Volumes*). Notable works include:

「**Héshàng Gōng** and **Yán Jūn Píng** both expounded the **Dao** of governing the state and nurturing the people. **Sōng Líng Xiānshēng** (Wei **Dài**), **Sūn Dēng**, **Táo Yǐn Jū** of the Liang, **Gù Huān** of the Southern Qi, and all elucidated the **Dao** of cultivating the self.

**Dí Jiān**’s time, **Luó Shí** and **Tú Chéng** of the Later Zhao; **Liáng Wǔ Dì**, the **Daoist** **Dòu Luè**, and all clarified the **Dao** of cause and effect, reason and principle.

The **Daoists** of the Liang—**Mèng Zhì Zhōu**, **Zāng Yǐng Jìng**—and of the Chen—**Zhū Jiāo**—as well as **Sòng Zhōu** **Dàoshì Liú Jìn Xǐ**, **Chéng Zǐ Huǎng** of the Tang, **Cài Zǐ Huǎng**, **Huáng Yǐn Zé**, **Lǐ Róng**, **Chē Huì Bì**, **Zhāng Huì Chāo**, and **Lǐ Yuán Xīng** all expounded the **Dao** of **zhòng** (重, *weight/importance*).

**Hé Yàn**, **Zhōng Fáng**, **Dú Yuán Kǎi**, **Wáng Fǔ Sì**, **Zhāng Sì**, **Yáng Hù**, **Lú Shì**, and **Liú Rén Fáng** all mastered the **Dao** of **xūjí wúwéi** (虚极無為, *emptiness and non-action*) in governing the family and the state. These are the scholars whose interpretations diverge in meaning.

Moreover, each school’s learning and doctrinal foundations differ:
- **Yán Jūn Píng** took **xū** (虚, *emptiness*) as his core.
- **Gù Huān** emphasized **wúwéi** (無為, *non-action*).
- **Mèng Zhì Zhōu** and **Zāng Yǐng Jìng** centered on **Dào Dé** (道德, *Virtue and Way*).
- **Liáng Wǔ Dì** held **fēiyǒu fēiwú** (非有非無, *neither being nor non-being*) as his principle.
- **Sūn Dēng** expounded the **Dao** of **zhòng** (重).
- **Zhōng Fáng**’s middle path, as praised by **Sūn Shì**, was considered profound.

The *Guāngchuān Dòngshū Zhì* (廣川董逌藏書志) states that under **Táng Zhōng** (唐宗), after **Lǐ Yào** (李約) annotated the *Lǎozǐ* (老子), the text was definitively revised, with the title changed to the *Dào Dé Jīng* (道德經). Wherever the term **Dao** (道) appears, it belongs to the upper volume; wherever **Dé** (德) appears, it belongs to the lower volume. The stone inscriptions were carved at **Wōkǒu** (涡口) in the **Lǎozǐ** Temple. It further states that the Tang **Daoist** **Zhāng Dàoxiàng** (張道相) compiled annotations of the *Dào Dé Jīng* in seven volumes, encompassing thirty families. Among those whose names remain recorded are:
**Héshàng Gōng**, **Jié Jiě** (節解); **Yán Zūn** (嚴遵), **Wáng Guāngtíng** (王光庭); **Hé Yàn** (何晏), **Guō Xiàng** (郭象); **Zhōng Fáng** (鍾防), **Sūn Dēng** (孫登); **Yáng Hù** (羊祜), **Jiū Mó Luóshí** (鳩摩羅什); **Lú Jǐng Yù** (盧景裕), **Liú Rén Fáng** (劉仁防); **Gù Huān** (顧歡), **Táo Yǐn Jū** (陶隱居); **Sōng Líng** (松靈), **Péi Chǔ Sī** (裴處思); **Dú Bì** (杜弼), **Zhāng Píng** (張凭); **Zhāng Sì** (張嗣), **Zāng Yǐng Jìng** (臧靜); **Mèng Ān Qī** (孟安期), **Mèng Zhì Zhōu** (孟智周); **Dòu Luè** (窦略), **Sòng Wén Míng** (宋文明); **Qú Rǒu** (虞柔), **Liú Jìn Xǐ** (劉進喜); **Cài Zǐ Huǎng** (蔡子晃), **Chéng Zǐ Huǎng** (成子晃); **Chē Huì Bì** (車恵弼).

Upon reviewing the *Yìwén Zhì* (藝文志) of the *New* and *Old Tangshū* (新舊唐書), additional names appear: **Mǔ Qiū Wàng** (母丘望, *humble and obscure surname omitted*); **Chéng Shào** (程韶), **Wáng Shàng Shù Cái** (王尚蜀才); **Yuán Zhēn** (袁真), **Shì Huì** (釋惠); **Yán Zūn** (嚴遵), **Yán Líng** (嚴靈); **Yì Yíng** (義盈), **Liáng Kuàng** (梁旷); **Zhōng Shān Chuán** (鍾山傳), **Yú** (奕); **Yáng Shàng Shàn** (楊上善), **Lǐ Yǔn Yuàn** (李允願); **Chén Sì Gǔ** (陳嗣古), **Rèn Zhēn Zǐ** (任真子); **Féng Guō** (馮郭), **Yǐng Shàng Qì** (景上器); **Hán Dú** (韓杜), **Liáng Wǔ Dì** (梁武帝); **Liáng Jiǎn Wén Dì** (梁簡文帝); **Jiǎ Dà Yǐn Jū** (賈大隱居), **Bì Lǘ** (辟閭); **Rén Dàn** (仁谞), **Liú Zhòng Róng** (劉仲融); **Wáng Sù** (王肅), **Dài Jìng** (戴逵); **Lǘ Zōng** (陸宗), **Lú Cáng Yòng** (盧藏用); **Xíng Nán Hé** (邢南和), **Féng Cháo Yǐn** (馮朝隱); **Bái Lǚ Zhōng** (白履忠), **Lǐ Bō** (李播); **Yǐn Zhī Zhāng** (尹知章), **Lù Dé Míng** (陸德明); **Chén Tíng Yù** (陳庭玉), **Lù Xī Shēng** (陸希聲); **Wú Shàn Jīng** (吳善經), **Sūn Sī Miào** (孫思邈); **Lǐ Hán Guāng** (李含光)—a total of forty families. Among those collected by **Zhāng Dàoxiàng** (張道相), **Guō Xiàng** (郭象), **Liú Rén Fáng** (劉仁防), **Sōng Líng** (松靈), **Péi Chǔ Sī** (裴處思), **Dú Bì** (杜弼), **Zhāng Sì** (張嗣), **Zāng Yǐng Jìng** (臧靜), **Dòu Luè** (窦略), **Sòng Wén Míng** (宋文明), **Qú Rǒu** (虞柔), **Liú Jìn Xǐ** (劉進喜), **Cài Zǐ Huǎng** (蔡子晃), and **Chē Huì Bì** (車恵弼)—these fourteen families are not listed in the *Zhì*. The *Zhì* records that **Zhāng Dàoxiàng** compiled four volumes, yet the texts collected by **Dòngshū** (董逌) number seven. Perhaps later scholars added to them.

In the **Chóngníng** (崇寧) era of our dynasty, the **Dàozàng** (道藏) was re-examined and standardized. This book is no longer found in the **Dàozàng**; only the four commentaries of **Lǐ Yào** (李約), **Héshàng Gōng** (河上公), **Yán Zūn** (嚴遵), and **Lù Xī Shēng** (陸希聲), along with the ancient edition of the *Dào Dé Jīng* transmitted by **Yú** (奕), remain.

Outside the **Dàozàng**, **Lǐ Yuè** (李約), **Lǐ Róng** (李榮), **Jiǎ Qīng Yì** (賈淸夷), and others each have their own commentaries. **Wáng** (王) and **Gù** (顧) and others, at the **Dàozàng**’s behest, compiled their annotated scriptures, and **Dú Guāngtíng** (杜光庭) further expounded the *Guǎngshèng Yì* (廣聖義)—all Tang-era scholars, now preserved in the **Dàozàng**. Only then did we realize that the *Zhì*’s records were incomplete. Alas, of those whose names remain, nine out of ten have lost their works.

**Lè Chén** (樂臣) studied under **Huángdì** (黃帝) and **Lǎozǐ** (老子), whose master was called **Héshàng Zhàngrén** (河上丈人). His origins are unknown. **Héshàng Zhàngrén** taught **Ān Qī Shēng** (安期生), who taught **Máo Xī** (毛翕); **Máo Xī** taught **Lè Huǎng** (樂瑕); **Lè Huǎng** taught **Lè Chén** (樂臣). **Lè Chén** then taught **Gài** (盖), who instructed in **Qí Gāomì Jiāoxī** (齊高密胶西) as **Cáo Xiàngguó**’s (曹相國) master—recorded in the *Shǐjì* (史记) *Lè Yì* (樂毅) transmission.

**Hàn Huán Tán** (桓谭) said: **Zhōng Fáng** (鍾防) expounded **Lǎo Dān**’s (老聃) teachings on **xūwú** (虚無, *emptiness and nothingness*) in two works. Later generations who favored them considered them excessive compared to the Five Classics. From the reigns of **Hàn Wén** (漢文) and **Hàn Jǐng** (漢景) onward, as well as **Sīmǎ Qiān** (司馬遷), all spoke of them—recorded in the *Yáng Xiáo* (扬雄) transmission.

**Yán Jūn Píng** (嚴君平) practiced divination with **shī** (蓍, *milfoil stalks*) and **shǎo** (筮, *yarrow stalks*). A native of **Chéngdū** (成都市), when faced with malevolent or improper questions, he relied on the **shī** (蓍) for guidance, speaking of profit and harm. When advising sons, he followed **xiào** (孝, *filial piety*); when addressing brothers, he adhered to **shùn** (順, *harmony/compliance*); when counseling ministers, he emphasized **zhōng** (忠, *loyalty*). He skillfully directed each according to their circumstances, and daily, teaching several students, he earned enough to sustain himself. Then he closed his shop and secretly transmitted the *Lǎozǐ* (老子), mastering all its teachings. His annotations, based on **Yán Zūn** (嚴遵) and **Lǎo** (老), amounted to over ten thousand words.

**Ruǎn Jí** (阮籍) wrote the *Tōng Lǎo Lùn* (通老論), stating: The **Dao** (道) is the principle that follows **zìrán** (自然, *nature/spontaneity*) and thus transforms. Sovereigns and kings who guard it will see all things naturally transformed. **Yì** (易, *Change*) calls it **Tàijí** (太極, *Supreme Polarity*); the *Chūnqiū* (春秋, *Spring and Autumn Annals*) term it **Yuán** (元, *Origin*); and **Lǎozǐ** calls it **Dao** (道)—recorded in the *Tàipíng Yùlǎn* (太平御览).

**Wáng Fǔ Sì** (王辅嗣), a native of **Shānyáng Gāopíng** (山陽高平), was precociously insightful. By his teens, he already studied the **Zhuāng** (莊) and **Lǎo** (老) texts, mastering their distinctions. **Hé Píng Shù** (何平叔) annotated the *Lǎozǐ* (老子), and when **Wáng** (王) saw his work, he marveled at its profundity, declaring: "Such a man can discuss the interplay between **Tiān** (天, *Heaven*) and **Rén** (人, *Man)!"** Thus, he composed the *Dào Dé Èrlùn* (道德二論, *Two Treatises on Virtue and Way*). The *Wèi Shì Chūnqiū* (魏氏春秋) states: "His annotations on the **Yì** (易) surpass **Hé Yàn**’s (何晏) in elegance, yet **Zhōng Fáng**’s (鍾防) natural exposition is even more refined."

**Yīn Zhòng Kān** (殷仲堪) possessed keen reasoning and could speak clearly. He once said: "If I do not read the *Dào Dé Jīng* (道德經) for three days, my tongue feels stiff and unyielding"—recorded in the *Shìjiè* (世說).

**Yǔ Zǐ Sōng** (庾子嵩) was broad-minded and measured. He claimed to be a disciple of **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ**, saying: "Before reading their works, I thought their principles were such-and-such. Now that I’ve seen them, they perfectly align with my own darkly intuitive understanding"—recorded in the *Jìn Yángqiū* (晉陽秋).

**Ruǎn Xuān Zǐ** (阮宣子), who favored the **Lǎozǐ** and **Yì** (易), could articulate their principles. When he encountered common people, he would leave them with disdain, never engaging. Though his family had no wealth, he lived in poverty like **Hé Yàn**—recorded in the *Míngshì Zhì* (名士傳).

**Zhōu Yàn Lún** (周彦倫) mastered the principles of names and logic. When guests gathered, he would expound on **xū** (虚, *emptiness*) without hesitation. His words flowed like a river, and listeners forgot weariness. He was particularly skilled in the **Lǎozǐ** and **Yì**, often engaging in prolonged discussions with **Zhāng Sīguāng** (張思光), leaving them unresolved for days.

**Ruǎn Zhàn** (阮瞻), son of **Ruǎn Xuān** (阮宣), was seen by **Sītú Wáng Róng** (司徒王戎). When **Wáng Róng** (王戎) asked him about **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ**, he replied: "The **Dao** (道) of **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ** is the same." **Wáng Róng** (王戎) sighed in admiration for a long time, then appointed him as **Bì** (辟) and called him the **"Sān Yǔ Dūn"** (三語掾, *Three-Word Magistrate*)—recorded in the *Jìnshū Běn Zhuàn* (晉書本傳) and *Shìjiè* (世說), with some accounts naming him **Ruǎn Xiū** (

**Zōng Cè** (宗测) in his youth was calm and serene, finding no joy in worldly affairs. When **Yùzhāng Wáng Yì** (豫章王嶷) conscripted him as a **cāngūnjūn** (參軍, *paramount military officer*), he replied: *"What is the point of this?"*—thus injuring the sea birds by felling trees and the mountain woods by cutting them down. To avoid such pursuits, he hung his ancestor’s portrait of **Xiàngzǐ Píng** (向子平) upon his wall and took along the *Lǎozǐ* and *Zhuāngzǐ* texts to bid farewell to his family in sorrowful tears. **Zōng Cè** (宗测) let out a long sigh and turned away without looking back.

**Zhòng Zhāng** (仲長), whose courtesy name was **Sīguāng** (子光) and whose personal name was **Zhāng Xuān** (張宣), traveled between **Hé Dōng** (河東) and worked to sustain himself, owning no home or dwelling and severing ties with his wife and children. By the end of the **Kāihuáng** (開皇) era, he retired to the banks of the **Fén** (汾) River, where he sold medicine as his livelihood. None knew him there. **Yóu Yóu** (游河) of **Fényīn** (汾陰) once visited him at the riverbank and, upon seeing him, exclaimed: *"This man surpasses even **Dōngfāng Shuò** (東方朔) and **Guǎn Shè** (管輅)!"* From that point onward, he gained renown and respect. When officials came to pay their respects, he would remain silent due to illness, never engaging in conversation. He preferred solitary wandering and composed a poem in praise of the **Hé Dōng** (河東) recluse, using it as his own epitaph. Those who knew him recognized him as a man of profound understanding. Some who sought the **Dao** (道) would write the characters **"Lǎozǐ Yì"** (老子易) and show them to him. He would then play the **qín** (琴) and dispense medicines, thus ending his days.

**Wáng Jì** (王績) was fond of wine and unable to bear official duties. He had several slaves who cultivated millet, and in spring and autumn, they brewed wine and raised ducks and geese. He cultivated medicinal herbs to sustain himself, reading the *Zhōu Yì* (周易), *Lǎozǐ* (老子), and *Zhuāngzǐ* (莊子) while keeping other books aside. He numbered his travels to the **Běishān** (北山) and **Dōnggāo** (東皋), and from then on, he called himself **"Dōnggāo Zǐ"** (東皋子).

**Wáng Xīyí** (王希夷) hid himself in the **Sōngshān** (嵩山) and studied under **Huáng Dǎn** (黃赜), learning the arts of **yǎngshēng** (養生, *nourishing life*). He delighted in reading the *Zhōu Yì* (周易), *Lǎozǐ* (老子), and consuming pine and cypress leaves mixed with flowers. At over seventy years of age, his vitality remained unwaned. When **Lǚ Zhēnyí Qīng** (盧齐卿), the **shìshì** (刺史, *prefect*), visited to inquire about governance, **Wáng Xīyí** (王希夷) replied: *"Do not impose upon others what you yourself do not desire."* The prefect deemed this answer sufficient.

**Zhēnyī Xiānshēng** (貞一先生), **Sīmǎ Chéngzhuān** (司馬承祯) by courtesy name, was called **Zǐwēi** (子微). He dwelled at **Tiāntái** (天台) and did not leave. When the **Ruìzōng** (睿宗) Emperor sent his brother **Sīmǎ Chéngyí** (司馬承祎) to summon him, he was already there. The Emperor led him into the **zhōngyuè** (中掖) hall and inquired about his teachings. **Sīmǎ Chéngzhuān** (司馬承祯) answered: *"The **Dao** (道) is daily diminished—diminished again and again, until it reaches **wúwéi** (無為, *non-action*). For what my mind and eyes perceive, I must already diminish it, yet still cannot cease. How much more so when confronting heterodox doctrines and straining my intellect!"*

The Emperor asked: *"How do you cultivate yourself?"* He replied: *"The state is like the self."* Thus, he sought harmony with simplicity, blending his **qi** (氣) with tranquility, and acted naturally without personal bias.

「Yet the realm was in harmony, and the Emperor sighed in admiration, saying, *"This is the speech of Guǎngchéng!"*

During the **Kāiyuán** (開元) era, he was summoned again and brought to the capital. **Zōng** (宗) issued an edict at **Wànghú Shān** (王屋山) to establish a hall and chamber for his residence. He was commanded to transcribe the *Lǎozǐ* (老子) in **sān tǐ** (三體, *three scripts*), and to settle the text and words. **[As recorded in the *Xīn Tángshū* (新唐書) *Yǐnshì* (隱士) biography and the *Jiùshū* (舊書) *Běnzhuan* (本傳), Zōng ordered him to transcribe the *Lǎozǐ Jīng* (老子經) in three scripts, and to correct and fix the text, establishing five thousand three hundred and eighty words as the authentic version, which he then presented to the Emperor.]**

**Lú Hóngyī** (盧鴻一), with the courtesy name **Hàorán** (颢然), secluded himself in **Sōngshān** (嵩山). In the sixth year of **Kāiyuán** (開元六年), he was conscripted to the Eastern Capital (洛陽) where he met with the Emperor but refused to bow. The Chancellor sent a **tōngshì** (通事) to inquire about his reason, and he replied: *"I have heard the Master Lǎo’s words: ‘The observance of rituals is but the thin veneer of loyalty and sincerity, insufficient to rely upon.’ Since I, Lú Hóngyī, hold loyalty and sincerity dear, I dare not prostrate myself before you."* **[As recorded in the *Jiù Tángshū* (舊唐書) *Yǐnshì* (隱士) biography.]**

**Zōngyuán Xiānsheng** (宗元先生), **Wú Jūn** (吳筠), was a scholar from **Lǔzhōu** (魯中). He entered **Sōngshān** (嵩山) and became a **Dàoshì** (道士, *Daoist). For many years, he wandered at **Tiāntái** (天台). When Zōng summoned him, the envoy conscripted him to the capital. Upon arrival, he was asked about the **Dao** (道) and its methods. He answered: *"The essence of the Dao/Way’s teachings is nothing like the Five Thousand Words. Its various branches and sprawling explanations merely waste ink and parchment."* **[As recorded in the *Jiù Tángshū* (舊唐書) *Yǐnshì* (隱士) biography and the *Xīnshū* (新書) *Běnzhuan* (本傳), the Emperor once asked him about the Dao, and he replied: ‘None surpass the profundity of the *Lǎozǐ*’s Five Thousand Words. The rest are but idle scribblings that waste paper.’ When further asked about immortality and alchemy, he said: ‘These are matters for rustics. Accumulating years and months to seek them is not a concern for the ruler.’ [The *Jiù Tángshū* (舊唐書) *Shàoshǐng* (少昇) biography has slight variations, hence both are included.]**

**Qín Xì** (秦系), a native of **Fáng** (防稽), fled to **Jiǎnxī** (剡溪) during the late **Tiānbǎo** (天寶) era to avoid the chaos. He dwelled in **Nán’ān** (南安) as a guest in **Quánzhōu** (泉州). There was a great pine tree over a hundred years old, whose roots he used to build his hut. Beneath it, he carved a stone for his ink slab and inscribed the *Lǎozǐ* (老子), never leaving. People called his dwelling **Gāoshì Fēng** (高士峰, *Peak of the High Virtue/Power Man*).

Emperor **Huìzōng** (憲宗) of the **Táng** (唐) consulted his Chancellor, saying: *"Is the matter of immortals and transcendent beings to be believed?"* **Lǐ Fān** (李藩) answered: *"The teachings of immortals originate from the **Dàojiā** (道家, *Daoist school). The Daoists revere the *Lǎozǐ*’s Five Thousand Words as their foundation. The *Lǎozǐ*’s principles align with the **Tàiyì** (太易, *Great Transformation*)—those who came before him, like **Xiānhuáng** (轩皇) and **Huángdì** (黃帝), sought the Dao/Way’s harmony. Later, the **Xiānhuáng** (轩皇) and **Huángdì** (黃帝) were deceived by strange and extravagant claims, falsely attributing immortality and transcendence to the *Lǎozǐ*. Thus, **Qín Shǐhuáng** (秦始皇) and **Hàn Wǔdì** (漢武帝) were misled by these teachings and ultimately gained nothing."* **[As recorded in the *Jiù Tángshū* (舊唐書) *Huìzōngjì* (憲宗紀).]**

**Táng** (唐) Chancellor **Lǔ Xīshēng** (陸希聲) annotated the *Dàodé Jīng* (道德經) in four volumes. His preface briefly states: *"The Master Lǎo’s teachings take the **Dao** (道) as their essence and use its name as their practice. They embody **wúwéi** (無為, *non-action*) yet achieve **wúbùwéi** (無不為, *nothing left undone*), aligning with the **Huángjí** (皇極, *Supreme Polarity*). The six schools that followed him—**Yángzhū** (楊朱), **Zhuāngzi** (莊周), **Wángshī** (王何), and others—all erred in their interpretations. **Yángzhū** (楊朱) lost sight of the Master Lǎo’s essence by overemphasizing self-preservation and undervaluing external things. **Zhuāngzi** (莊周) lost the balance by exaggerating the application of the Dao. **Shēnxiān** (申韓) distorted the Master Lǎo’s name by adopting harsh and extreme methods. **Wángshī** (王何) strayed from the Dao’s core by embracing empty, unrestrained doctrines. These six schools are all the Master Lǎo’s ‘sinners.’*

Now, I elucidate and annotate to clarify his teachings and to harmonize with **Fáng** (防). Again, I say: *"In ancient times, **Fǔxī** (伏羲) drew the **Bāguà** (八卦, *Eight Trigrams), symbolizing the principles of all things, exhausting the essence of life and nature. He followed the **Dàodé** (道德) in harmony. The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) expounded upon **xiāntiāndì** (先天地, *before Heaven and Earth*), originating from **yīnyáng** (陰陽, *yin-yang) and reaching the extremes of life and nature. This aligns with **Fǔxī** (伏羲) in its source. **Wénwáng** (文王) observed the **Tàiyì** (太易, *Great Transformation*) through the **Jiǔliù** (九六, *Nine and Six*) movements, valuing the **jiāng** (剛, *strong/rigid) and upholding change, yet balancing it with moderation. The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) discerned the **Tàiyì** (太易) in its **qīng** (清, *seven*) and **zhèng** (正, *eight*) aspects, seeking the **róu** (柔, *soft/compliant) and guarding stillness, yet unifying it with the **Dà** (大, *Great). This aligns with **Wénwáng** (文王) in its core principles. **Kǒngzǐ** (孔子) inherited the traditions of **Yáo** (堯) and **Shùn** (舜), following the constitutional models of **Wénwáng** (文王) and **Wǔwáng** (武王), guiding the people with the teachings of **rén** (仁, *benevolence*) and **yì** (義, *righteousness). The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) contemplated the **Fǔxī** (伏羲) and synthesized **Huángdì** (黃帝), embracing the world with the **Dàodé** (道德) transformation. This aligns with **Kǒngzǐ** (孔子) in its authority. These three sages—**Fǔxī** (伏羲), **Wénwáng** (文王), and **Kǒngzǐ** (孔子)—are the pinnacles of sainthood. The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) transformed and harmonized their teachings, reversing and merging them to explore the mechanisms of change and the subtleties of the Dao’s essence. This can be called the most profound of all."*

**Lǐ Wèigōng** (李衛公), **Déyù** (德裕), advised Emperor **Jìngzōng** (敬宗) against searching for Daoists in his memorial, stating: *"I have heard that the highest **Dao** (道) is none other than **Guǎngchéng** (廣成). Among the sages of antiquity, none surpasses **Xiānhuáng** (轩皇). **Kǒngzǐ** (孔子) questioned **Xiānhuáng** (轩皇) about the principles of self-cultivation, and **Guǎngchéng** (廣成) replied: ‘Do not look, do not listen; embrace the **shén** (神, *spirit) and maintain stillness. Your form will naturally correct itself; your spirit will naturally purify. Do not exert your body, do not shake your **jīng** (精, *essence). Thus, you may attain longevity.’ Again, he said: ‘Those who attain my Dao will become **Huáng** (皇, *Emperor*) above and **Wáng** (王, *King*) below.’"* **[As recorded in *Lǐ Wénráo Jí* (李文饒集).]** *"**Kǒngzǐ** (孔子) said: ‘Remove your arrogant **qì** (氣), your excessive desires, your indulgent expressions, and your licentious thoughts—these are all harmful to your body. What I have told you, if you follow, will suffice.’ The sages of old, in their profound understanding of the Dao, did not err in their teachings. If **Guǎngchéng** (廣成) and **Xiānhuáng** (轩皇) were to appear and speak to Your Majesty, I believe their words would not surpass these."*

**Xiāngshān Báifēngōng** (香山白文公) resided in **Yì** (易) and said: *"To make the people frugal and simple, and to bring peace and harmony to the times, one must first embody the **Dàodé** (道) of **Huáng-Lǎo** (黃老). Its **Dao** (道) lies in upholding **kuānjiǎn** (寬簡, *leniency and simplicity), practicing frugality, and maintaining naturalness. It does not require **cōngchá** (聰察, *sharp discernment) nor does it force the intellect. The skill lies in its application—even in a single village, a single prefecture, a single state, or reaching the entire world, one may achieve the principle of **qīngjìng** (清靜, *clarity and stillness).* **Fáng** (防) and **Mì** (宓) were humble yet attained it, so they did not descend from their chambers, yet the people of **Dānfǔ** (單父) were transformed. **Jì** (汲) **Pǐn** (黯) attained it, so he did not leave his study, yet the governance of **Dōnghǎi** (東海) was accomplished. **Cáo Shēng** (曹參) attained it, so he did not interfere with the markets or prisons, yet **Qíguó** (齊國) was in great harmony. **Hàn Wéndì** (漢文帝) attained it, so he did not use punishments, yet the realm was greatly governed. The reason is this: where **qīngjìng** (清靜) prevails, **qīngjìng** (清靜) is its outcome."* **[As recorded in *Bái Shì Chángqìng Jí* (白氏長慶集).]**

「Zhang Xuanming (張荐明) in his youth was renowned for his Confucian learning and traveled through the **Hé Shuò** (河朔) region. Later, he became a **Dàoshì** (道士, *Daoist adept*), mastering the **Dào** (道, *Dao/Way*) of **Lǎo Zǐ** (老子) and **Zhuāng Zhōu** (莊周). When summoned by **Jìn Gāozǔ** (晉高祖, *Emperor Gaozu of Jin*), he was asked whether the **Dàojiā** (道家, *Daoist School*) could govern a state. He replied, *“The **Dào** (道, *Dao/Way*) is that which subtly penetrates all things; those who grasp its utmost may govern the world even while seated at home.”* The emperor was delighted by his words, invited him into the inner palace, and lectured him on the *Dàodéjīng* (道德經, *Classic of Virtue and the Dao*). He then bowed to Zhang as his teacher, bestowed upon him the title **Tōng Wǔ** (通微, *Master of Profound Insight*), and afterward he vanished without trace. **[As recorded in *Wǔdài Shǐ* (五代史, *History of the Five Dynasties*)—*Yīxíng Zhuàn* (一行傳).]**

**Tàizǔ** (太祖, *Emperor Taizu of Song*) was campaigning against **Tàiyuán** (太原) and stationed at **Zhèn Yáng** (鎮陽, *Zhenyang*). He heard that the **Dàoshì** (道士, *Daoist adept*) **Sū Chéng** (蘇澄) had secluded himself since the **Wǔdài** (五代) era, repeatedly declining invitations to court. When summoned to the imperial residence, Sū was already eighty years old. The emperor asked him about **yǎngshēng** (養生, *nurturing life*). Sū replied, *“My method of nurturing life is nothing more than refining thought and harmonizing **qì** (氣, *qi*). For rulers, however, it is different. **Lǎo Zǐ** (老子) said, ‘If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves; if I have no desires, the people become simple.’ Non-action and non-desire mean focusing the mind and achieving serenity. In ancient times, **Huángdì** (黃帝) and **Táng Yáo** (唐堯) ruled for long years by this **Dào** (道, *Dao/Way*).”* The emperor marveled at his words. **[As recorded in *Dōngdū Shìlüè* (東都事略) in *Yǐn Mì Zhuàn* (隐逸传) and *Gāo Dào Zhuàn* (高道传).]**

**Sòng Tàizōng** (宋太宗, *Emperor Taizong of Song*) spoke to his close ministers, *“When I read **Lǎo Zǐ** (老子) and reach the passage ‘**Jiābīng** (佳兵, *fine weaponry*)—that which is not auspicious, the **shèngrén** (聖人, *sage*) uses only when forced,’ I cannot help but reread it three times as a warning.”*

**Hóngméng Zǐ** (鸿蒙子) **Zhāng Wúmèng** (張無夢), styled **Língyǐn** (靈隱), loved **qīngxū** (清虚, *clarity and emptiness*). He delved deeply into **Lǎo Zǐ** (老子) and **Yì** (易, *Classic of Changes*), entering **Huáshān** (華山) where he befriended **Liú Hǎichán** (劉海蟾) and **Fàng** (放, *the recluse*). He served **Chén Xīyí** (陳希夷) as a **fāngwài yǒu** (方外友, *lay friend of the Dao*). Wúmèng often grasped subtle principles of **Mìfāng** (微防, *gentle restraint*), and after a long time, he retreated to **Tiāntái Shān** (天台山). **Zhēnzōng** (真宗, *Emperor Zhenzong of Song*) summoned him and asked about strategies for longevity. Wúmèng replied, *“I am a rustic. In the mountains, I have only recited **Lǎo Zǐ** (老子) and **Zhōuyì** (周易, *Classic of Changes*). I know nothing else.”* When offered the position of **zuǒláng** (作佐郎, *assistant official*), he declined and returned to the mountains. The emperor bestowed upon him gold and silk, along with the title **chǔshì** (處士, *recluse*), but he did not accept. **[As recorded in *Gāo Dào Zhuàn* (高道传).]**

**Lěizhāi** (了斋) **Chén Zhōngsù** (陳忠肅) once wrote twenty-plus essays titled *Zhāoyǔ* (昭语, *Illuminating Words*), whose preface briefly states: *“The **Yùqīng Zhāoyìng Gōng** (玉清昭应宫) instructed me to request **Wáng Zēng** (王曾) to review the **Dàojiā** (道家) scriptures in the **Sānguǎn** (三馆, *Three Scriptural Halls*). I spoke of my work, which, though not as refined as **Lǎozǐ**’s (老氏) *Wǔqiān Zhēn* (五千言, *Five Thousand Words*), still embodies **qīngjìng** (清静) and **jiǎn’āo** (简约, *simplicity and brevity*).”*
**Zhāng Zhībái** (張知白) said, *“Your Majesty’s attention to this is the art of **wúwéi** (無為, *non-action*) in governing the state.”* **[As recorded in *Lěizhāi Jí* (了斋集).]**

**Tián Jiànyì** (田谏议) **Xīchǐ** (锡尺) wrote in the preface to his *Shùfù* (述赞): *“When the **lóng** (龍, *dragon*) rises, it ascends from wood; when a ruler emerges, humanity is his foundation. Yet there are **sèngshèng** (聖聖, *sages without rank*) and **táocáng zhān** (韜光之賢, *virtuous scholars who conceal their brilliance*), whose legacies and abilities intersect like **Qiū Míng** (丘明) and **Zhòngní** (仲尼). Thus, **Qiū Míng** (丘明) could elucidate the *Chūnqiū* (春秋, *Spring and Autumn Annals*) to establish **shēngjiào** (聲教, *moral teachings).*
**Yǐn Xǐ** (尹喜) was such a **zhān** (賢, *virtuous scholar), and **Lǎo Dān** (老聃, *Lǎo Zǐ*) was his **chǐchǔ** (尺木, *foundation*). Thus, he could consult on **Dàodé** (道德, *Virtue and the Dao*) to leave guidance for posterity.”** **[As recorded in *Xián Píng Jí* (咸平集).]**

**Chén Zhōngsù** (陳忠肅) said, *“**Lǎo Zǐ** (老子) states that the world’s sacred instrument—the **Dào** (道, *Dao/Way*)—cannot be wielded by force; those who attempt to seize it ruin it. He also says, ‘To govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.’ The cook of fish need not fuss over the flames; he merely balances **shuǐhuǒ** (水火, *water and fire*) to achieve the proper degree of done-ness. **Shùn** (舜) ruled with non-action—was it not by this principle?*
*Furthermore, **Wǔdì** (武帝, *Emperor Wudi of Han*) abandoned **Huánglǎo** (黃老, *Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teachings*) for Confucianism, yet he never strayed from **rényì** (仁義, *benevolence and righteousness*). In practice, however, his effects were no different from **Qín Shǐhuáng** (秦始皇). When **Fáng Xī** (防希, *Mifang*) was in office, the world was not without chaos for a single day. People longed for the governance of **Wénjǐng** (文景, *Emperors Wen and Jing of Han*), yet that could never be recovered. Then again, what harm did **Huánglǎo** (黃老) bring to the world?*
*Again, **Shū Guǎng** (疏廣) told his son **Shū Shòu** (疏受): ‘Knowing contentment brings no disgrace; knowing restraint brings no peril. Once fame and office are achieved, to depart in fear of regret is wise.’ Thus, father and son retired together, feigning illness, and returned to their homeland. Later generations and scholars of virtue have praised this, yet their understanding of **zhǐ** (止, *restraint*) stems from **Lǎozǐ**’s (老氏) teachings.”* **[As recorded in *Lěizhāi Jí* (了斋集).]**

**Ōuyáng Wénzhōng** (歐陽文忠) **Gōng Xiū** (公修) wrote in his *Qiánhòu Jì* (前后记): *“The **Qián** (前, *before*) and **Hòu** (後, *after*) follow one another; the **cháng** (長, *long*) and **duǎn** (短, *short*) contrast each other. Extending this analogy, the principles of all things follow this pattern. Yet **Lǎozǐ** (老子) composed his book with words that seem to advocate **xūwú** (虛無, *emptiness and nothingness**), yet his methods for governing humanity are profound. He said, ‘If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves; if I love stillness, the people naturally align.’ Even the **sage’s** governance from the southern face of his throne cannot surpass this.”* **[As recorded in *Běn Jí* (本集).]**

**Yánpíng Xiānshēng** (延平先生) **Luó Cóngyàn Zhōng** (罗从彦仲) once remarked: *“**Kǒngzǐ** (孔子) never praised nor criticized **Lǎozǐ**’s (老子) writings. If he had praised them, later scholars would have been drowned in his **hétóng tóngchén** (和光同塵, *harmonizing with the world and blending with dust*) teachings, descending into **bùjī** (不羁, *unbridled behavior*). If he had criticized them, the principle of **qīngjìng** (清静) would have been dismissed as mere theory. Yet why should it be criticized? Since he neither praised nor criticized, it is only proper that he did not speak of them at all. Thus, he merely said, ‘I compare myself to **Lǎo Dān** (老聃) and **Péng** (彭).’”*

Someone asked **Yáng Wénjìng** (杨文靖) of **Yǐngshān** (荥山) about the term **Lǎo Péng** (老彭). He replied: *“‘**Lǎo Péng**’ refers not to **Péng**’s (彭) longevity but to **Lǎozǐ** (老子) and **Péng** (彭籛, *Péng Zhèn*). Yet **Lǎozǐ**’s (老氏) writings truly embody **shù ér bù zuò** (述而不作, *reciting without composing*) and **xìn ér hǎogu** (信而好古, *believing in and loving antiquity*).”* **[As recorded in *Yǐngshān Jí* (荥山集).]**

**Yǐngshān** (荥山) said: *“Only when all private intentions are exhausted can one respond to the world. **Lǎozǐ** (老子) said, ‘You are now the **wáng** (王, *king*).’”* **[As recorded in *Yǔlù* (语录).]**

**Yíngyáng Lǚ Gōng Xīzhé** (荥阳吕公希哲) once inscribed on a wall: *“In governing people and harmonizing with heaven, nothing surpasses **sè** (啬, *frugality) at the outset.”* He considered this the essential method of **xiūyǎng** (修養, *cultivation and nurturing*). Though it is a technique for **yǎngshēng** (養生, *nurturing life*), its application extends to safeguarding oneself and one’s family, ensuring **ānshēn** (安身) and **ānjiā** (安家). **[As recorded in *Lǚ Shì Zázù* (吕氏杂录).]**

**Dōngpō** (东坡) **Sū Wénzhōng** (蘇文忠) **Gōng Suī** (公轼) received imperial orders to compose the stele for **Shàngqīng Chǔxiáng Gōng** (上清储祥宫). He wrote: *“I humbly examine the **Dàojiā** (道家) School, which originated with **Huángdì** (黃帝) and **Lǎozǐ** (老子). Its **Dào** (道, *Dao/Way*) centers on **qīngjìng wúwéi** (清静無為, *clarity, stillness, and non-action*), and its practice lies in **xūmíng yìngwù** (虚明应物, *illuminated responsiveness to things*). Its conduct is marked by **cíjiǎn bùzhēng** (慈俭不争, *benevolence, frugality, and non-contentiousness*), aligning with the *Yì* (易). It requires no deliberation, no thought. The *Lúnyǔ* (论语) states, ‘The **rénzhě** (仁者, *benevolent person*) is still, and thus attains longevity.’*
*From the **Qín** (秦) and **Hàn** (漢) dynasties onward, the **Dào** (道, *Dao/Way*) was first applied by **fāngshì** (方士, *adepts of the Way*), who introduced **fēixiān biànhuà** (飞仙变化, *transformation and ascension to immortality*), **Huángtíng Dàdòng** (黃庭大洞, *Great Cavern of the Yellow Court*), **Tàishàng Tiānzhēn** (太上天真, *Supreme Celestial Purity*), **Mùgōng Jīnmǔ** (木公金母, *Wood Master and Golden Mother*), and the worship of **Tiānhuáng Tàiyǐ** (天皇太乙) and **Zǐwéi Běijí** (紫微北极, *Purple Darkness and Northern Pole). Down to the present, all **dānyào qíji** (丹药奇技, *elixirs and esoteric techniques*), **fújù xiǎoshù** (符箓小数, *talismans, charms, and minor rites*) are attributed to the **Dàojiā** (道家). I have privately analyzed this: **Huángdì** (黃帝) and **Lǎozǐ** (老子) represent the **běn** (本, *root*), while the **fāngshì** (方士) teachings are the **mò** (末, *branch*).”*

In his *Cáotáng Jì* (曹堂记), he wrote: *“When **Cáo Cān** (曹參) served as **Qíxiàng** (齐相), the **Jiāoxī** (胶西) **Guāng Gōng** (盖公) was renowned for his mastery of **Huánglǎo** (黃老). When the people requested **Cáo Cān** (曹參) to implement his methods, **Qíguó** (齊國) flourished. Later, he applied the same principles to govern the world, and the world has since praised him as a **xián** (賢, *virtuous scholar).*”

「I became the governor of Jiāoxī (胶西) and came to know **Guāng Gōng** (盖公) as a man of **dàojiā** (道家) virtue. I sought his tomb and descendants but could not find them, and with a sigh, I pondered him deeply. Through his teachings, I imagined his character.

**Cáo Cān** (曹参) was a loyal minister of the **Hàn** (汉) dynasty, while **Guāng Gōng** (盖公) served as his teacher—this was indeed a grand affair. Yet the historians do not record how his life ended. Could it be that he was one of the **zhìrén** (至人, *perfected sages*) of old, who attained the **Dao** (道) and did not die? [*See this collection.*] Later, **Sū Zǐyóu** (苏子由) wrote after composing his own *Lǎozǐ Jiě* (老子解):

*"I was forty-two years old when I was exiled to Yúnzhōu (筠州). Though Yún was a small state, it had many ancient **chán shè** (禅刹, *Buddhist monasteries*). Monks from all directions gathered there. Among them was **Dàoguān** (道全), a descendant of **Nán Gōng** (南公) of **Huángbì Shān** (黄蘗山). His conduct was lofty, and his mind was open, so he delighted in following me as I traveled. Once, he spoke with me of the **Dao** (道), and I told him: ‘What you speak of, I have already found in Confucian texts.’

He replied, ‘This is **Fófǎ** (佛法, *Buddhist dharma*). How did the Confucians obtain it?’

I said, ‘No, I have indeed heard of the **Dao** (道), which Confucians do not possess. Why force me to falsely claim it? Still, it exists, though the world does not know it!’

The **Dao** (道) of **Rú** (儒, *Confucianism*) and **Fó** (佛, *Buddhism*) do not mutually illuminate one another, just as **Hú** (胡, *non-Chinese*) and **Hàn** (汉, *Chinese*) peoples do not understand each other’s languages. How then do you know it?

He said, ‘Try to explain its essence to me.’

I replied, ‘The book of **Zǐsī** (孔子之孙, *Confucius’ grandson*), **Zǐsī** (子思), states: *“The Doctrine of the Mean”* (**Zhōngyōng** 中庸). In *“The Doctrine of the Mean”*, it says: *“When joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen, this is called the **Zhōng** (中, *Mean). When they arise and are all in accordance with the **Zhōng** (中), this is called **hé** (和, *harmony).”* The **Zhōng** (中) is the **Dàběn** (大本, *great root*) of all under Heaven, and **hé** (和) is the **Dádào** (达道, *great Way*) of all under Heaven. To achieve **Zhōnghé** (中和, *central harmony*), the **Tian Di** (天地, *Heaven and Earth*) attain their proper positions, and all things are nurtured.

Is this not the **Dao** (道) of the **Rú** (儒), and what else could it be? Though the sources of speech may differ, the meaning is the same.»

全曰：「如何言之？」予曰：「六祖有言：不思善，不思恶，方是时也。孰是汝本来面目？自六祖以来，人以此言悟入者，太半矣。所谓不思善不思恶，则喜怒哀乐之未发也。盖中者，佛性之异名；和者，六度万行之总目也。致中极和，而天地万物生于其间。此非佛法，何以当之？」

全惊喜曰：「吾初不知也。今而后始知儒佛一法也。」

予笑曰：「不然。天下固无二道，而所以治人则异。君臣父子之间，非礼法则乱。知礼法而不知道，则世之俗儒，不足贵也。居山林，木食涧饮，而心存至道，虽为人天师可也。而以之治世，则乱。古之圣人，中心行道，而不毁法，而后可耳。」

全作礼曰：「此至论也。」

是时，予方解《老子》，每出一章，辄以示全。全辄叹曰：「皆佛说也。」

予居筠五年而北归，全不久亦化去。逮今二十余年也。

凡《老子》解亦时有所刋定，未有不与佛法合者。时人无可与语，思复见全而示之，故书之《老子》之末。

大观二年十二月十日，子由题。

又曰：予防南迁海康，与子瞻兄邂逅于藤州，相从十余日，语及平生旧学。子瞻谓予：「子所作《诗传》、《春秋传》、《古史》三书，皆古人所未至；惟解《老子》，差若不及。」予至海康闲居无事，凡所为书，多所更定。乃再录《老子》书以寄子瞻。自是防恩归北，子瞻至毗陵得疾不起。逮今十余年，竟不知此书于子瞻为可否也。

政和元年冬，得侄迈等所编先公手泽，其一曰：「昨日子由寄《老子新解》，读之不尽卷，废卷而叹。使战国有此书，则无商鞅、韩非；使汉初有此书，则孔、老为一；使晋宋间有此书，则佛、老不为二。不意老年见此奇特，然后知此书当子瞻意然。予自居颍川十年之间，于此四书复多所删改，以为圣人之言非一读所能了，故每有所得，不敢以前说为定。今日以益老，自以为足矣。欲复质之子瞻，而不可得。言及于此，涕泗而已。」

十二月十一日，子由再题。

眉山苏籀，颍滨文定公之孙也。记其遗言曰：「公为籀讲《老子》数篇，曰：高于孟子二三等矣。又曰：言至道，无如五千文。又曰：公老年作诗，云近存八十一章，注从道老聃门下，人盖老而所造益妙，录录者莫测矣。」

吕吉甫作《道德经传》，成以元丰元年表进于朝曰：

「臣恵卿言：臣闻庖丁奏刀，得养生于文恵；轮扁释凿，议读书于齐桓。志之不分，道或有在。臣诚惶诚恐，顿首顿首。

臣窃以大制散于智慧之伪，含生失其性情之初。爰有真人起，明至教，独推原于《道德》。盖祖述于典坟，是以鸡犬相闻，庄周指谓神农；上谷神不死，列子称为黄帝之书。究其微言，中有妙物，唯恍唯惚，视听莫得以见闻。不古不今，迎随孰知其首尾？失之其出，弥远至宝，秘于荆山而莫知悟之。不召自来，珠索之象罔而可得。轩辕、华胥之国，唐尧、姑射之山，皆极至游，遂臻泰定。此书之指，其诣不殊。

曹防师于盖公，而相齐国；孝文传之河上，而为汉宗。仅得浅肤，犹防康阜。夫唯俗学不识道真，徒见其文有异于诗书之迹，莫知其指。乃是皇王之宗，故闻不尚贤则谓遗之野而不收；不贵货则谓弃诸地而不用；谓绝学则无忧等于禽犊；谓绝圣则无法等于鸿荒。不知灵府之间，有若清眸之上，虽留金屑，亦翳神光。故令善恶之两遗，而极冲虚之一致。

兹难情度，冝使智迷，遂以允圣之信言，列于百家之珍说。发兹微学，宜属至神。伏惟皇帝陛下以高真之质，而出应君师；以妙本之余，而形为事业。蛊饬而庶政交举，革当而四方已孚。方将齐心服形，而捐治物养己之累，深根固蒂，以臻长生久视之门，同天下于华胥，见神人于姑射。深造其极，适丁斯时。

臣性维颛防，生足忧患，每思朝彻以解天弢，泛观以考其散殊，又损而期于吻合。维日不足，历年于兹。晚于斯文，忽若有得，即动而静，物芸芸而归根。由浊以清，中冥冥而见晓。遂以其意达之于辞，虽云自安，未知其可。窃谓至人之静鉴，实为学者之元凶。敢用冒闻，以占中否。

龙随章防，固难知其上；天马以智专，因可取于辨道。倘有一言之补，敢辞万死之诛。

所着《老子道德经传》，凡计四册。谨奉表投进，以闻。

臣恵卿诚惶诚恐，顿首顿首。

谨言，元丰元年正月日。

资政殿学士、通议大夫、定州路安抚使、马步军都总管兼知定州军州事及管内劝农使、上轻车都尉、东平县开国伯食邑八百户臣吕恵卿上表。」

【按李彦平先生遗书云：吕吉甫读《庄子》至参万岁而一成，纯遂大悟性命之理，故其《老庄》二解独冠诸家。】

The Master of Farming from Lu’s Mount Ertao said: Since the Qin dynasty, the learning of *xìngmìng* (性命) has not been practiced in the world, and the Dao/Virtue of the *Dàodé* (道德) has long been fractured. The scholars of the age, alas, are obscured by incomplete and one-sided books, daily sinking into the triviality of commentaries and annotations, thus losing their innate *xìngmìng* essence and failing to grasp the great purity of Heaven and Earth or the fundamental principles of the ancients. I lament this deeply.

For the *Dàodé* is what Guan Zhong used to sincerely cultivate the heart and what Laozi employed to sincerely harmonize intentions. Its profound and subtle meanings, its subtle and wondrous principles—there are many of them. They can awaken those obscured by learning, restoring their innate *xìngmìng* essence. Alas, for over a thousand years, they have remained veiled by the trivialities of commentaries. Thus, I have composed this *transmission* to illuminate what was obscured.

Though sages in the lower realms are many, those who recorded their teachings in the spirit of *Dàodé* were not solely Laozi. Rather, he was concise, while Liezi elaborated further, and Zhuangzi elaborated still more. Thus, my exposition combines the detailed accounts of Liezi and Zhuangzi, synthesizing them to ensure the *Dàodé*’s intent is not lost.

---

**Annotations in the text:**
- *Xìngmìng* (性命): "Nature-Life" (a key Neo-Confucian/Daoist concept blending innate human nature and vital essence).
- *Dàodé* (道德): "Dao/Virtue" (here emphasizing the *Dàodéjīng* as a text of moral-philosophical depth).
- *Ellipsis* in "眉山唐庚子西曰..." and "淮海秦观曰...": Quotations from later scholars (Su Shi’s *Mishan Ji* and Qin Guan’s views) inserted as marginal notes.

---

**Mishan’s Master Tang (Su Shi) said:** The world doubts that Laozi’s western journey was merely a pretense, claiming he had compassion, practiced frugality, and yet did not seek to lead the world. If he held to the Dao and wandered among people, what would he reject or pursue? This is utterly mistaken. Precisely because he was without exclusion, he could move anywhere—even among the barbaric and uncivilized. This is why he was Laozi.

**Huaihai’s Qin Guan said:** Ban Gu praised Sima Qian for his *Shiji*, yet criticized him for his "erroneous judgments against the sages." He claimed that in discussing the Great Dao, Sima Qian prioritized Huang-Lao over the Six Classics. Who would have thought that a man of Sima Qian’s vast talent and erudition would err so? In my view, this is not so. Sima Qian truly had insight and expressed it.

Mencius said: *"Rén* (仁) is what it is to be human."

「In summary, the *Dao* is the guiding principle, *virtue/power* (德) is the means to attain it, *rén* (仁) is the essence of humanity, *yì* (義) is its fitting application, and *lǐ* (禮) is its embodiment in form. The heavens are its unified expression.

When *Dao* is embraced, all is harmonious; when divided, it scatters. Indeed, *virtue/power* (德) encompasses *rén* (仁), *yì* (義), and *lǐ* (禮), while *rén* (仁) and *yì* (義) are but partial aspects of *virtue/power* (德). The Huang-Lao school values unity and despises division, thus regarding *Dao* as the foundation and the Six Classics as its practical application. In matters of cosmic harmony, it offers broad strokes; in matters of restraint, it provides meticulous detail. Hence, it emphasizes *rén* (仁), *yì* (義), and *lǐ* (禮) in practice. Sima Qian’s discussion of the Great Dao—prioritizing Huang-Lao over the Six Classics—is not without insight, is it?

He further said: History records that Cui Hao compared himself to Zhang Liang, claiming that his study of antiquity surpassed Zhang’s. But in my view, Cui Hao never matched the erudition of Xun Ji or Jia Yi, how could he dare aspire to Zhang Liang’s level? The former refined his own life with meticulous skill, while the latter applied his remaining talents to governing the world. Once his task was complete, he withdrew into seclusion—truly a follower of the Dao. He observed celestial phenomena and discerned the changes of the times to aid human affairs, mastering superficial details yet ignorant of their roots—truly a follower of the Yin-Yang school. Zhang Liang began his journey in Xiaopi, receiving teachings from the elderly man by the riverbank, and ultimately declared, *"I wish to abandon worldly affairs and follow Chi Song!"*—his methods were clearly rooted in Daoist practice. Yet Cui Hao, proficient in divination and numerology, spoke of the *Yinghuò* (荧惑) entering Qin and the comet extinguishing Jin, as well as the hare appearing in the rear palace and Yao Xing offering his daughter—these claims were most peculiar. When he was banished for advocating the *Zhuang* (庄) and *Lao* (老), he dismissed their teachings as fabrications—thus, his methods were clearly rooted in Yin-Yang alone. This is why they differ.

**Mount Huaihai’s Li Tai (李泰伯) said:** Han Yu remarked that the *Laozi* claimed, *"The Sage Laozi is a disciple of Confucius,"* and the *Buddha* also claimed, *"The Sage Laozi is a disciple of Confucius."* Han Yu, though small in stature, also said, *"My teacher has spoken thus."* The teachings of the *Buddha* I cannot fully examine, but the *Records of the Historian*’s account of the *Laozi*’s biography includes a query about *lǐ* (禮), and history is not entirely trustworthy. Even the *Analects* and the *Confucian Classics* contain errors.

**Mount Song’s Jing Yu (景迂) said:** Fu Xi, King Wen, and the Duke of Zhou praised the *Yijing* (易) after them, yet only the Sage Laozi understood its transformative flexibility, its yielding and extending. He valued softness and emptiness, adaptability and non-attachment, yet his earnestness in articulating these principles was fortunate indeed. This text’s preservation is a blessing.

He further said: Wang Bi’s annotations on the *Laozi*’s *Daodejing* truly captured the Sage’s learning, were they not? His interpretations follow the tradition of Yan Junping. Wang Bi stated that *rén* (仁), *yì* (義), and *lǐ* (禮) cannot function on their own but require *Dao* to apply them. Heaven and earth, myriad things each receive their share—how could this be limited to Laozi alone? All scholars must recognize this truth.

He further said: Wang Bi knew that the finest weapons are not auspicious, yet he treated victory as if it were a funeral rite—this was not Laozi’s teaching but rather an ignorance of the eternal. The Sage’s virtue lies in always aiding people, thus never abandoning them; always aiding things, thus never abandoning things. Only the Master of the Yellow River (河上公) and the ancient texts possessed this understanding. It was fortunate that Fu Yi could discern this truth.

**The Biqiuzi (碧虚子), Chen Jingyuan (陈景元), a disciple of Zhang Hongmeng (张鸿蒙), once compiled the *Daodejing* in the *Cangshu* (藏室) and annotated the *Zhuangzi*’s *Fang* (防) chapter, gathering the refined interpretations of ancient scholars and supplementing them with his teacher’s esoteric traditions. The work was presented to the Emperor during the *Xīníng* (熙宁) era and received imperial commendation. His annotations on the *Nanhua Jing* (南华经) covered chapter meanings and pronunciation, totaling over twenty volumes. These are now included in the *Daozang* (道藏).

**The Xicang (溪堂), Xie Shou (谢寿), in his *Tingji* (亭记), said:** When Confucius spoke of *rén* (仁) as longevity, when Laozi spoke of *"dying yet not perishing"* as longevity, and when the *Buddha* spoke of *"limitless life"*—the three sages, though their words differed, their meanings were the same. The *rén* (仁) of humanity exhausts the *xìng* (性); exhausting the *xìng* (性) means dying yet not perishing; dying yet not perishing means that their longevity could never be measured. Yet those who merely observe the hair turning white, the nails growing long, the return of tears and saliva to water, the warmth of breath to fire, and the movement of limbs to wind—these superficial signs—believe the person has truly died. They fail to see that the essence remains undiminished, never ceasing to exist.

「【As seen in the *Dao Xiang* (道乡) collection of Zou Zhonggong (邹忠公), Zou Hao (浩) notes:】
*"The door of the female* (牝之门)—taking it from my own body—is the nose (则鼻也). The nose is the passage through which breath (息) enters and exits. Gentle and continuous like the flow of the Dao, if one does not overuse it, then one’s breath is deep and profound (则其息深矣). Sun Shu Ao (孙叔敖) had a nose that seemed to breathe with effortless grace (鼻间栩栩然)."»

Zhuangzi said: *"The breath of the True Person (真人之息) surpasses that of the common person (以踵众人之息). The common person, when bent and yielding (屈服者), breathes with a rasping throat (其嗌言若哇); the one with deep desires (其嗜欲深者) has shallow vital essence (其天机浅)."*

The *Su Wen* (素问) states: *"Without the processes of ascent and descent (升降), there would be no growth, flourishing, aging, or death (非升降则无以生长化收藏). Without the processes of ebb and flow (出入), there would be no growth, flourishing, aging, or decline (非出入则无以生长壮老). Ascent and descent, ebb and flow—without vessels (器), these would not exist (升降出入无器不有). To value the preservation of constancy (常守) is to understand this, and only then does one know the Way of the Grain Spirit (谷神) in its eternal vitality (不死)."*

Again, it says: *"Empty your mind (虚其心), and your belly will naturally fill; weaken your will (弱其志), and your bones will naturally strengthen."*

「【As seen in the *Dao Xiang* (道乡) collection】 Zou Bo (邵伯温) said: Master Kangjie (康节先公) regarded Laozi’s *Dao De Jing* (老子) as the embodiment of the *Dao* (知易之体) and Mencius’ teachings as its application (知易之用). In his discussions on the *Zhongzi* (中子) text, he acknowledged the Buddha as a Sage of the Western lands (西方之圣人) without hesitation (不以为过).»

Western Pond (西塘) Zheng Xia (郑侠) said: *"I have heard that Laozi said: ‘Knowing contentment brings no disgrace; knowing cessation brings no peril.’ The *Yijing* (易) states: ‘The word *kàng* (亢) means knowing advance yet not knowing retreat, knowing preservation yet not knowing perishing, knowing gain yet not knowing loss, knowing growth yet not knowing decline. Only those who know advance and retreat, preservation and perishing, gain and loss without straying from the Dao (正)—only these are the *Sages* (圣人).’ Yet then, how can the principles of advance, retreat, preservation, perishing, gain, and loss not be harmoniously aligned? Why is it so difficult to know retreat and perishing, contentment and cessation, yet why do the Sages so earnestly praise and marvel at them?*

*"It is all one (是皆一也). Advance and retreat have their Dao (道), so advance does not falter and retreat is not difficult. Preservation and perishing have their Dao, so preservation does not bring joy and perishing does not bring sorrow. Advance, retreat, preservation, and perishing all return to the Dao: when cessation (止) is appropriate, one ceases; when action (行) is appropriate, one acts. Who does not see their harmonious alignment?*

*"Again, it says: The superior person, hearing the Dao, strives diligently to practice it (勤而行之). The middle person, hearing the Dao, finds it like a lingering presence—sometimes there, sometimes gone (若存若亡). The inferior person, hearing the Dao, laughs at it (大笑之). To not laugh is to not grasp the Dao (不笑不足以为道).*

*"Again, it says: The Dao is vast (惟道大), and thus it seems like both the unworthy and the worthy are encompassed within it (似不肖若肖). If one strives to emulate it (乆矣), yet only in a trivial way (其细也)—then, to emulate it is to emulate it."*

The nourishment of the common is small, for this reason.
The customs of the world nourish only the petty—thus the great are deemed unworthy.
These are all unfit to converse with about the Dao.

Again, it says: The Dao is vast, yet things are small—
how people scurry and yet perish!
The petty are burdened by things.

The Original (元) is the source of all goodness, reaching to the great.
To attain it yet not know its greatness is to align with the Dao,
yet differ not from the vulgar.
Thus the world calls my Dao great, yet unworthy—
for they scrutinize and compare, while I alone remain tranquil,
deeming the world insufficient.
Hence, my difference.
Thus I achieve greatness, possessing it without worldly measure.
Therefore, the vulgar and the inferior hear it and laugh—
only then may one guard against the Dao.
If one does not laugh, it is not the Dao.

Again, it says: Water benefits all things yet does not contend.
It dwells where others abhor—
thus it is guarded by the Dao.
Yet if it stagnates, it becomes foul and impure,
unfit even for washing one’s feet—
this is self-inflicted, not guarded against evil.

Those who seek to restore their nature take this as a mirror:
know that the clear and bright comes from one’s true nature,
while the turbid and chaotic arises from external influences.
Remove the stagnant and confused—
then clarity and brightness reside within.
Then, even if waves surge and mud stirs,
they cannot alter me—
for they cannot transform me.
Yet they gradually become clear and pure,
though none perceive it.
I act, yet none know my force.

Again, it says: Water’s nature is clear,
yet it emerges from the earth—
thus it is so turbid.
Slow it, and it becomes clear enough to reflect hair.
Human discernment is bright,
yet it arises from things—
thus it is so confused.
Slow it, and it shines like the sun and moon.
Before, turbid water becomes clear when slowed;
before, confused clarity returns when still.
Thus, the turbid and chaotic are always imposed from without,
while the clear and bright are inherent within.

Heaven and Earth unite to descend sweet dew—
no one commands it, yet it distributes evenly.
Rain and dew, though minute in the cosmos,
are yet evenly spread.
How much more so the human spirit!

Again, it says: Before the Three Dynasties,
there were no teachings of Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, or the Buddha.
The Sage encountered the Emperor, the Emperor the King,
and the King declined—
only then did the Three Teachings emerge,
merely to rescue the world from drowning.
I once composed *The Great Celebration Resident’s Preface*, saying:
The Resident’s foundation is Confucianism, with Confucius as its master,
yet I attained Laozi’s teachings to illuminate it.
[As seen in *Western Pond Collection*]
Leaf Dream said: The *Book of Changes* was abridged from Yao and Shun,
yet only reached Fu Xi, Shen Nong, Huang Di, and then Yao and Shun.
Thus, those before Yao were real—
the Six Classics remain, yet their origins are untold.
If one examines it with the heart, its saying is:
*The Book of Changes* requires no thought, no action—
still and unmoving, yet responsive, it communicates with all under Heaven.
Who but the most divine could attain this?
Only then does one know that Fu Xi, Shen Nong, Huang Di,
down to Yao and Shun, all transmitted this—
retreat to Laozi’s teachings, and nothing differs from *The Changes*.

Again, it says: The *Analects* records that Confucius compared himself to Laozi and Peng Zu.
Mencius followed Confucius—
Mencius, in Confucianism, did not diminish even by a hair.
His rejection of Yang Zhu and Mo Di,
his opposition to ritual excess like Qin and Qin’s tyranny,
exceeded even Jie and Zhou—
yet he did not reach Laozi’s depth.
Only when he spoke of *exhausting the heart, knowing nature, reaching to fate*
did Laozi’s intent become profound.
Thus, Laozi’s teachings were never abandoned by Confucius and Mencius.

Again, it says: Laozi’s teachings differ from Confucius’
only in their rectifying language,
yet they align with *The Changes*.
After Laozi, several hundred years passed,
and the Buddha emerged—
his words were even more remote and profound,
yet in essence, they reached the same truth as Laozi,
almost forming a complementary pair.
[As seen in *Scriptural Commentaries*]
Leaf Dream said: Laozi’s theory of *qi* advocates concentrating *qi* to achieve softness like an infant.
Mencius’ theory of *qi* speaks of the utmost greatness and rigidity—
nurturing it without harm, filling Heaven and Earth.
These two seem opposite,
yet from Laozi’s perspective, Mencius is abandoned,
and from Mencius’, Laozi is.
But in my view, the two are not truly opposed.
Scattered *qi* contends with things, becoming rigid;
concentrated *qi* turns inward, becoming soft.
Rigidity cannot overcome rigidity—
only softness can conquer rigidity.
Thus, concentrating *qi* is the means to achieve straightness.
Straightness, nurtured without external harm,
is how one maintains resolve without violence—
as Zengzi guarded his boundaries.
Yet when restraint accumulates to excess,
it returns to guarding.
Thus, straightness nurtured is the means to achieve softness.
Truly, the Dao’s ultimate essence is undivided.
[As seen in *Stone Forest Beneath the Rocks*]

Dong Si Jing said: Laozi’s Dao takes natural purity and non-action as its foundation,
using clarity and responsiveness without obstruction as its function,
practicing benevolence, frugality, humility, and non-contention as its conduct,
and opening the way for others without desiring to lead as its governance.
In governing self and others, it is supreme—
if applied, the governance of ancient times could be restored.
Yet in his era, the age favored artifice over simplicity,
and the pure and unadorned had vanished.
Laozi upheld the pristine Dao,
yet his time resisted him—
he could not be positioned to transform the world,
knowing the times were contrary.
Yet he never let the Dao perish without transmission—
thus, his teachings endured, though obscured,
and lingered in the strange customs of the Western lands.
His pity for his time and concern for posterity—
how profound!
Fortunately, this tradition did not vanish—
thus, in the Western Pass, I awaited the carriage in Donglu,
and the *Dragon’s Record* remains.

The Riverbank Master, Huangshi Gong, Le Su Gong,
and their disciples—
they could truly examine and embody the Dao.
If they confined its practice to themselves,
their world would be that of the Three Sovereigns.
Yet when the Dao was transmitted,
Emperor Gaozu practiced it as a gentleman,
Liu Bang relied on it as a minister,
and Cao Shen used it as a chancellor.
Truly, they restored a single lineage after the harshness of Qin—
ah, another verification!

Yet if one were to advance further still—
to emulate the Sage of the Primordial Age,
then one would truly be the Sage of the Primordial Age.

Some may see this text’s words and meaning,
vast and inclusive, yet fail to grasp
the moment of utmost subtlety and stillness,
the depth of profound emptiness and settled virtue—
the foundation for all governance and affairs.
Instead, they merely toil in dull obscurity,
habitually falling into complacency and neglect,
until they are criticized for empty detachment,
useless in practice.

Thus, the uninitiated may dismiss it—
alas, what a pity!

Some say its teachings are veiled in metaphor and hidden precepts,
so the opening chapter speaks of *wu* and *you*,
of the Two Dan, of divine *qi* and the interplay of water and fire.
To empty the heart and fill the belly—
this is the method of refining lead.
To master warfare and battle—
this is the art of extracting silver.
The character *chong* (冲), with water and center radicals,
symbolizes the true unity within the *qi*.
Thirty spokes converge at a single hub—
this illustrates the five *zang* organs,
each bearing the six *qi*’s essence,
and the correspondence to the moon’s phases and fire’s numbers.
Such meanings are now omitted—
why? Because nature must be self-realized,
while techniques require a master’s guidance.
If one truly embodies the precepts,
the precepts will already be complete within them—
then oral transmission, meticulous in detail,
leaves no room for doubt.
How could mere scribbles on paper suffice?

Moreover, this text upholds the essence of *Dao* and *virtue*,
expounding the Way of non-action,
transcending all forms, yet penetrating their core—
how could it tolerate the intrusion of trivial doctrines,
mixed with petty speculations?

Bai Juyi remarked:
*"The Yellow Emperor’s Five Thousand Words*
*speak neither of medicine nor immortality,*
*nor of ascending to heaven in broad daylight—*
*this is also a matter of debate."*

The Master of Shu, surnamed Ruo, styled himself "Laiyuanzi." During the Shaoxing era, he composed *An Exegesis of Laozi*, beginning with:

*"According to the Records of the Historian, Laozi served as the Keeper of the Archives. As the Zhou declined, he departed. Guan Yinzi [Emperor Jing of Zhou] said, ‘Master, you are about to withdraw—please write a book for me.’ Thus, he wrote the *Daodejing* in two sections, over five thousand words on the Way and virtue, before leaving. No one knows his ultimate fate. Because the Records mention ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ sections, later scholars divided it accordingly—upper on the Way, lower on virtue. But logically, the Way and virtue are inseparable; this division is mere vulgar speculation. I have removed it.

Moreover, some unknown person arbitrarily split the original text into eighty-one chapters, focusing only on diagrams, symbols, and yang numbers—all frivolous speculations offering no benefit to humanity. I have also discarded these.

Many commentators exist, yet though they may grasp the principles, they fail in application; though eloquent in theory, they lack method. For instance, they claim *‘pìn’* (牝) means ‘mouth and nose’—this is incorrect in principle. They say *‘sǐ’* (死) refers to *nirvana*—this is incorrect in fact. Such reckless annotations, scattering words without foundation, stem from their failure to attain the Dao.

Confucius sought the Dao, yet since the Dao is formless, he grounded himself in virtue, making virtue the foundation. Once the foundation is established, the Dao arises naturally. How could one neglect virtue while pursuing the Dao? This is akin to passing a door without entering the chamber.

Many conflate technique with the Dao, mistaking filth for essence, dullness for purity, speed and slowness for nature, stillness for non-action, and abstinence from flavors for tranquility. They deem coming and going as natural, celibacy as purity—such people are unworthy of discussing the supreme Dao. As *Baopuzi* states in Volume Eight: *‘Though the Five Thousand Words originated with Laozi, they are but broad and superficial discussions. Even if one claims to understand its beginning and end, what evidence do they offer? These people speak only of chamber arts and alchemical elixirs, clinging to contrivance as their practice, their minds fixated on profit, lust, and measuring the Dao of non-action by worldly desires. Thus, they fail to grasp its essence—how much less can those beneath them?’*

Again, some elevate reckless action as the highest virtue, placing moral cultivation as secondary. To conceal one’s body, alter one’s form, transform appearances, and dwell in seclusion is deemed demonic. Confucius did not speak of supernatural feats or chaotic forces, for they yield no benefit. Laozi’s teachings on longevity and vision sought to advance the Dao, not cling to it exclusively. Even immortals dwelling on the Three Mountains remain earthbound; riding the *luán* (鸾) to court the Emperor does not elevate them beyond heaven. They linger between heaven and earth, enduring for ten thousand years—yet if they do not advance the Dao, what distinguishes them from the *dàchūn* (大椿, the great cypress)? This is not mere debate; it is a warning against fixating on alchemical techniques while neglecting the Dao.

Yan Gushan (Jiang Mao) remarked:
*"The Dao is elusive—how can it be spoken of? What we call the Dao is but a name; in truth, it is not the Dao itself. The Five Classics speak of it broadly, while Laozi, Lie Yukou, and Zhuangzi expound it in detail. Though their approaches differ, both elucidate the fundamental source of the Dao.*

*Someone asked: ‘Did Laozi compose the *Daodejing* as a single work, or was it compiled later?’ I replied: ‘This cannot be determined.’*

*I once encountered an ancient text of the *Laozi* in a private collection, differing slightly from the current version but sharing the same meaning. Only the order of passages varied, leading me to suspect later scholars fragmented it.*

*The Dao encompasses all things, yet the Five Thousand Words record only what can be spoken of as the Dao. To separate it into ‘Way’ and ‘virtue’ seems unjustified."*

I said: *"Though the terms differ, the essence is the same. Why distinguish between ‘Dao’ and ‘virtue’?"*

He replied: *"How can you say that? I have read the Five Classics and the Hundred Schools—whenever they speak of ‘Dao’ and ‘virtue,’ they distinguish between greater and lesser, earlier and later. This cannot be generalized without examination."*

I said: *"Zhuangzi lamented that later scholars, though skilled in parsing the Dao into trivialities, failed to grasp its weight. Do you not fear repeating their mistake?"*

He said: *"Let me hear your view."*

I replied: *"The Dao is formless—‘without’ is the Dao. Virtue arises from what one attains. The Dao is the path all share; virtue is what each cultivates for themselves. Take water as an analogy: the vastness of lakes and seas differs from the stagnation of a well, yet both are water. The torrent of rivers contrasts with the sluggishness of ditches, yet both are water. Water is the Dao—‘without’ is its nature. Lakes, seas, wells, rivers, and ditches each manifest it differently. This is how the real and the named diverge yet remain one.

*Scholars who study the Dao must refine their minds, attune their spirits, and balance excess and deficiency until self-sufficiency is achieved. Then virtue is complete, and standing is secure. Advancing virtue until it encompasses the Dao returns one to the original state.

Thus, the Dao is not excessive beyond virtue; virtue is not deficient without the Dao. When virtue is perfected, the Dao becomes hidden. The sage embodies the complete Dao; the virtuous person manifests the complete virtue. This is their distinction.*

*You ask: ‘The Dao is subtle and formless—how can virtue be seen?’*

*The Dao has no fixed form; virtue has a manifest nature—its success or failure is evident to mind and eye. How can it be unseen?*

*The Dao is without constant name; virtue has a defined substance. When separated, virtue can be named, while the Dao cannot. Hence, Laozi’s teachings, arising amid the fluctuations of his time, all point to the supreme truth. Though his words vary—beginning and end, yin and yang—they converge in their ultimate meaning. What need is there for such distinctions?*

*[Question on Virtue]*

*Again, he said: ‘What arises in the heart is inexhaustible; thus, what is commanded by the body never ceases. Death and rebirth, life and death—beginning and end cycle endlessly, like an unending wheel. Laozi spoke of birth and death: ten attain life, ten attain death, and ten perish in motion. Three threes make nine—speaking in tens, birth and death are one. What does this mean? It refers to those who grasp the vital breath.*

*The scholar who aspires to the Dao must cultivate the body to await it, act straight yet adapt flexibly, and endure to fulfill their destiny."*

「Though one may inquire thus, **[Question on Vital Breath]** he further said: ‘Some ask why Laozi, Lord Lieh, Zhuangzi, and Mencius—all ancient masters who attained the Dao—each sought to persuade later generations with their teachings, yet contradicted one another so sharply. Laozi said, *“I have a great affliction: my body.”* Lord Lieh replied, *“The inward observer takes trust from the body.”* Zhuangzi declared, *“My body is not truly mine.”* And Mencius asserted, *“All things are complete within me; by reflecting inward and being sincere, no greater joy exists.”* Some reject the body as an affliction, while others prize its completeness and take what is sufficient. Is this not mutual contradiction?

I say: You have not pondered deeply. You grasp their words but not the reasons behind them. The four limbs, hundred bones, five viscera, and six entrails—all are present and complete; this is called the *body* (形). Sight, hearing, speech, appearance, thought, and innate nature—these are also called the *body*. Yet though the name is one, the means by which they speak of the body differ. Laozi and Zhuangzi focus on its *form* (體), while Lord Lieh and Mencius emphasize its *nature* (性). When speaking of *form*, the four limbs, hundred bones, five viscera, and six entrails are what they mean—if they exist, there is affliction; if not, there is no affliction. Hence, they cannot allow it to exist. But what they call *non-existence* is not annihilation; rather, it means that all movements, words, and actions are imperceptible, and only *nature* remains. When speaking of *nature*, sight, hearing, speech, appearance, thought, and the unified principle—all are complete within the self. If one inwardly observes them, they can take what is sufficient: lofty yet grounded, vast yet intimate, discerning all without deficiency. Who could say such completeness is absent from me? Who could say such sufficiency is lacking in the body? Thus, Laozi and Zhuangzi’s teaching on the body seeks to make it non-existent, while Lord Lieh and Mencius’s teaching seeks to make it observed.

**[Question on Vital Breath]** He further said: ‘Some ask, what is *breathing at rest* (息)? I reply: It is the harmonious flow of yin and yang, balancing left and right, following the *zi* and *wu* cycles of waxing and waning. Its movement is like an unceasing wheel, its rotation like an endless loop—it intermingles with primordial *qi* (元氣), never resting day or night. This is what Laozi and Lord Lieh called *penetrating qi* (沖氣). If one knows how to guard *breathing at rest*, they know how to nurture *qi*. If they know how to nurture *qi*, they know how to enter the Dao. If they know how to enter the Dao, they can embrace the One and attain *chan* (禪) and *ding* (定), fixed in their singular purpose without deviation. Laozi said, *“Continuous, as if something exists, yet used without exertion.”* If one seeks this and understands it, they will gain insight.

**[Question on Qi]** He further said: ‘Confucius taught, *“Have no fixed intentions; have no self.”* Laozi said, *“When I have no body, what affliction can I have?”* Master Zhìchán (瞿昙) said, *“No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no self.”* If all these exist, how can one make them non-existent? Truly, *non-existence* is the convergence of all virtues and the foundation of all teachings. If one can externally still all external influences and internally rest the mind in *non-existence*, they will align with the Dao. Its convergence is singular—how different is it from what is called *sitting and forgetting* (坐忘) or *facing the wall* (面壁)?

The *Clamber* (袤) character is Zhòng Zhǎng (仲長), a man from Sānqú (三衢). His self-given title was Yán Gǔshān (嚴谷山人). He cultivated his natural essence in his garden retreat and used his learning to instruct students. During the reign of Emperor Guāng (光廟), when he was a scholar-official in the Palace Academy, officials sought his writings on *Laozi’s Easy Classic* (老子通言). His response was: *“What is the value of Laozi’s teachings? He grasped the fundamental principles and could govern all things through the Dao—this is his strength. Though he prized *non-being* over *being*, and warned against worldly speech, it was not his weakness. Hence, the Emperor who followed Laozi’s teachings was Emperor Hán Wén (漢文帝), who ruled with great success. His governance largely entailed purifying the heart, reducing desires, and maintaining profound silence and simplicity to nurture the realm. This was not to neglect all affairs; rather, his foundation was firm, and his legacy enduring, because he understood its essence and applied its strengths.

As for the Western Jin (西晉), they heard his words but took *non-action* (無為) as mere governance without understanding its true nature. They thought it meant abandoning laws and measures, passively doing nothing, and expecting the realm to govern itself. Thus, the state’s principles collapsed, and chaos ensued. Wang Tóng (王通) remarked, *“The Jin’s virtue was in emptiness and stillness, yet their realm fell into disorder—this is not Laozi’s fault. They failed to grasp its essence and misapplied its strengths.”* My humble hope is that Your Majesty adopts the Dao’s fundamental principles as a model, follows the Han’s governance, and avoids the Jin’s neglect of affairs. Then, Laozi’s profound words and marvelous Dao will all be within Your Majesty’s application.

He also wrote *The Record of Virtue in the Palace Academy* (潛藩盛德錄), where one passage states: *“I once had the honor to converse with officials. Whenever the Dao was discussed, I took the *Easy Classic’s* (老子) passages on *Dao-instrument* (道器) and Confucius’s *lower learning, higher attainment* (下學上達) to compare and illustrate. The *Dao-instrument* and the *learning-attainment* can be grasped from both perspectives—like firewood generating flames, the lower form (下形) is necessary to manifest the higher Dao (上形之道). Without the lower instrument (下器), one cannot attain the higher learning (上學). Wood, though coarse, contains its own vitality—if it can produce flames, it can ascend. The *Six Classics* (六經) and the *Mencius* (論孟) speak much of *instrument* and little of *Dao*—they are like storing wood to seek flames. Laozi and Zhuangzi’s texts speak much of *Dao* and little of *being*—they are like saying the *Six Classics* have already spoken of the wood, so no need to repeat.”*

The Confucian scholars, in their pursuit of the Dao, have the *Six Classics*. It seems they need no aid from Laozi and Zhuangzi. Yet Laozi and Zhuangzi’s texts delve deeply into guarding and guiding the Dao, offering particularly precise and essential insights. If one can widely embrace these teachings, they will greatly benefit. One must not, however, be like the Jin scholars, who spoke of emptiness and stillness yet abandoned ritual, music, penal laws, and governance, claiming the realm could self-regulate. Such folly is unheard of—can there be flames without firewood?

**[Again]** He further said: *“Now, Daoists who study Laozi’s teachings abandon the Dao’s essence, speaking only of formulas, medicines, prayers, and exorcisms—how far they have strayed from the original intent! Only the Tang poet Bái Jùyì (白居易) could clarify this, as his verse states: ‘How much more so the *Dao-instrument* (道器) of the Yellow Emperor (黃元皇帝)—Laozi’s *Five Thousand Words*—speaks not of medicine, not of immortality, not of the sun ascending in white light to the heavens.’”*
The *Yellow Emperor* (黃元皇帝) refers to Laozi.

The Daoist tradition takes Laozi as its teaching ancestor, yet beyond the eighty-one chapters on purity, simplicity, and few desires, there is not a single word concerning how he might have fabricated empty claims about medicines, immortals, or prayers for exorcism and warding off evil. Respectfully heeding the sage’s admonition, I affirm that the full recitation of Bai Juyi’s poem only deepens my admiration for his understanding of Laozi’s essential truths.

**[Also found in this collection]**

Yongjia’s Zheng Bo-xiong (景望) said: The Master applied the Yellow Emperor’s teachings alongside Cao Can’s governance in Qi and was praised for it, yet scholars of the Confucian school often disparage the Yellow Emperor’s words. Why? I have often shut myself away, sitting in silence all day, careful in my movements, sparing in tastes, and keeping my heart serene and my *qi* balanced—no illness has ever intruded. I have not sought to preserve what is already complete nor dispersed what is lacking; I have not craved what I do not need. Thus, those who age and die find peace in simplicity. If this principle is applied universally, why should only the hundred-li realm of Qi benefit? The methods of Confucius and Mencius—how could they be anything but this? Yet why do scholars disparage the Yellow Emperor’s words? Truly, what the Daoists today speak of as "purity" is nothing but delusion beyond this.

**[As recorded in Master Zheng’s *Steady Words*]**

Xue Hui’s disciple, Xue Cai, compiled *Laozi’s Collected Explanations*, and High Master Gao Shusi wrote the preface. Laozi was born in Meng, and his writings speak of the Dao’s emptiness. Since the Han, none have traced its origins. Only the people of Liang have glimpsed a partial truth, and from this arose the later interpretations. Thus, the book of Liang’s people—Mr. Xue, the Censor—first pondered the Dao’s source, seeking harmony between heaven and humanity, reconciling all doctrines with measure. Laozi’s Way then shone forth in brilliant clarity. The book was completed in the ninth year of Jiaqing (嘉靖, 1529), in the year of the Tiger (庚寅). The preface states:

*"The Dao’s essence converges in unity, yet its expressions vary. The sages’ teachings align in sentiment but differ in words. In ancient times, Confucius’ disciples spoke of the Dao of heaven, and thereafter, none could hear it again. Yet the *Yijing*’s six dragons—beginning with ‘Do Not Use’ and ending with ‘Exhausted and Overreaching’—never reveal fortune or misfortune to people. When the nine lines appear, the six dragons have no head, and Confucius praised it: ‘The nine lines manifest the heavenly virtue—it cannot be the leader.’ The *Qian* hexagram’s nine lines reveal the heavenly pattern: firm yet yielding, the Dao of heaven. How does this differ from Laozi? Thus, I say: My understanding of Laozi is like seeing a dragon.*

*The scholar’s greatest flaw is ignorance of the unity between heaven and humanity. Ignorance of this unity makes their discussions of the sages shallow. From ancient times, who has surpassed Laozi in speaking of *ren* (仁), *yi* (义), *li* (礼), and *yue* (乐)? Yet he did not ignore heaven. Who has surpassed Confucius in speaking of *yin-yang* and *yang-yin*? Yet he did not ignore humanity. The sages taught differently, and scholars believed what they spoke; they doubted what they did not. Thus, those who study Laozi disparage Confucianism, and Confucians disparage Laozi. Knowing humanity but not heaven leads to folly; knowing heaven but not humanity leads to deception. How can one judge the sages with such partiality?

*Some say Laozi’s book is about nurturing life. The sage’s Way—internally nourishing the body to ensure longevity and externally ordering affairs to bring harmony—is the same for all sages. Their methods are of one thread. The authors are long gone; their echoes and bones have decayed. Yet their spirit lives on in their words. Xue’s *Laozi’s Collected Explanations* in two volumes is kept at home; I have copied it here.*

*Again, it is said: The Censor Xue, having secluded himself in Meng for a decade, devoted himself to learning. In the year of the Tiger (庚寅), he annotated *Laozi*, titling it *Collected Explanations*. I wrote this preface, and the book was printed. The Master’s intentions were not yet fully realized, so he revised it again in the year of the Hare (丁酉), and it was completed. Upon reading it, I found his interpretations profound, aligning with the Great Middle. Since the Han, no one has understood *Laozi* as decisively as this. Yet the world has no one to recognize him. Who, then, can understand the Master’s annotations?*

*The preface continues: When I was young, I read *Laozi* and thought it was merely the words of an ancient emperor or a noble, speaking of lofty matters beyond common use. Truly, if one secretly applies it, it suffices to cultivate governance and bring order. As I read further, I saw that its teachings harmonize with the sages’ Way without contradiction, applicable to the world. Yet its phrasing is often exaggerated, making it difficult to grasp. The unwise, desiring to believe, resort to supernatural explanations, and thus it was dismissed by Confucians as a book on longevity. His disciples clung to it, causing its words to fade into obscurity. The ancient sages all studied both self-cultivation and governance—some saw it deeply, others superficially, some purely, others mixed. Why must we abandon it entirely, making the world avoid speaking of *Laozi*? His book nearly vanished.*

*I harbored this thought until I met the Chancellor of Wu City, Master Wang Chunfu (王纯父). I asked him: Confucius and Laozi differed in speech—why? Master Wang replied: They both lived in the late Zhou, witnessing the flourishing of culture and eager to return to antiquity. Their words were passionate, and passion often leads to excess. Confucius himself said: ‘If a person lacks *ren*, how can there be *li*? *Li*! *Li*! Is it not about jade and silk?’—meaning that *li* without *ren* is mere empty ritual.*

*Thus, the differences between them are clear.*

The Chancellor of Wu City then said: *"Let us be frugal, and Laozi would reply: ‘Ritual is the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust, yet the root of chaos. Thus, his words are so vehement that they drift far from Confucius’ measured speech. Therefore, the Master’s teachings are chanted as law for ten thousand generations, while Laozi’s is discarded as something else entirely.*

I kept his words hidden until later, when I served in Shanxi and consulted Master Cao Defang, the Prefect of the Capital. He said: *‘The sages speak of the Dao—just as people name the sky. The Chinese call it *Tian*, while the Xiongnu call it *Chenglei*. Is there truly a difference? Only their words vary. The sky does not know itself, yet people insist on naming it and debating its nature. Thus, the true scholar seeks only the Dao; all else may be forgotten.’*

Ah, how profound his words were! Both these masters delved deeply into Laozi’s thought. Now, examining the *Kaogong* commentary, I find it aligns with the *Yi*’s *Great Transmission*: *‘Though all paths lead to the same end, their ways diverge; though all thoughts converge, their expressions vary. Scholars, accustomed to hearing only differences, fail to see the unity beneath them. They rush to condemn what they do not understand—how could it be just Laozi alone who suffers this fate? Alas, it is difficult to speak of!*

If such a person arises in a hundred generations, they will know it themselves. What need have I for praise or blame? I record these two masters’ words and preface them with this account.*

Li Hongfu engraved Zi You’s commentary in Jinling, and inscribed beneath it:

*‘To eat until full—this is one thing. Southerners eat rice and find it sweet; northerners eat millet and find it sweet. Though one is south and one north, they do not envy each other. Yet if they were to exchange places, they would not reject it either. The Dao in Confucius and Laozi is like rice and millet to the south and north—though one may not envy the other, can it truly be discarded?’*"*

「What then? When one is truly sated, each finds their fill, but when one is truly hungry, there is no rejection. Indeed, I once studied in the north and ate at my host’s home. At first, I knew not its taste.

The cold was severe, and heavy snow fell for three days, cutting off all grain. Seven days passed in hunger, cold, and exhaustion—I gazed upon my host’s table with longing. My host took pity on me, cooked millet, and fed me. I devoured it without pause, unable to discern its nature.

Only after clearing the table did he ask, “Is this not rice and wheat?” I replied, “What strange delight is this?” My host laughed, “This is just millet and barley—no different from what you had before. It is only because you were so hungry that it seemed so fine, and only because it was so fine that you ate so much.”

Now, when you look back, you no longer imagine it as rice and wheat nor as millet and barley. I heard this tale and sighed deeply. If my understanding of the Dao were as desperate as my hunger for food, would Confucius and Laozi hesitate to choose me?

From that moment, I vowed to study the Dao tirelessly, day and night, without rest or food. Later, I obtained *Zi You’s* commentary on *Laozi’s* *Dao De Jing*, as well as *Jiao Ruo’s* commentary—many have expounded on *Laozi*, yet *Zi You* stands supreme.

*Zi You* cited the *Analects* of *Zhu Xi* (宋自明道以后), saying, *“Before the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, they are called ‘the Middle.’ The Middle before they arise is the mystery of all things.”* Ever since *Zhu Xi*’s *Illumination of the Dao* (明道), each generation has passed down this teaching, instructing their disciples to observe the *qi* of their nature and ask, *“What is its state?”*

*Zi You* alone grasped the subtle meaning within the fragmented texts and broken passages, thus proving his mastery in elucidating *Laozi’s* profound teachings. His five thousand words shine forth like a bright sun—students cannot bear to part with them even for a day.

His commentary reveals the Dao in its entirety, and his intent is fully aligned with *Laozi’s*. He entrusted his meaning to *Zi Zhan*, who also understood it perfectly. Now, five hundred years have passed since *Zi You*, yet here I find this rare and extraordinary work again. Alas, only the truly hungry can attain such wisdom!

In the twelfth month of winter, the second year of *Wàn Lì* (萬曆), *Hongfu* inscribed this preface.

*Master Li Hongfu*, having already engraved *Zi You’s* commentary on *Laozi*, a year later composed his own two-volume commentary. He wrote in the preface:

*“I once read *Han Fei’s* commentary on *Laozi*—though it was not entirely without merit, I could not help but pity him. *Han Fei*, with all his talent, was ultimately executed in *Qin*—yet even in his flawed exposition of *Laozi*, was he not a man of great effort? How could it be said that he accomplished nothing?”*」

Now, the one employs softness and weakness while the other, strength and firmness—this one is bold in daring while that one is bold in not daring. The contrast between the square and the round, ice and fire, is already clear. Yet to claim that *Dao/virtue* and *de* (power) are the ancestral traditions of *Shen Buhai* and *Han Fei*—how can that be?

*Sū Zhīzhān* sought it but could not find it, so he forced an interpretation, saying:

*"The learning of Laozi weighs heavily on non-action and lightly on governing the world and the state. Thus, benevolence is insufficient for love, and ritual is insufficient for reverence. Han Fei obtained the means by which one lightly regards governing the world, and so he became ruthless, harsh, and merciless without hesitation. Alas! If this is so, then how can it be said that one cannot govern the world and the state with it?

Was Laozi’s learning truly like this? Laozi was not one who could govern but did not govern; rather, he was one who did not govern *because* he governed. Thus, those who truly cherish their own bodies do not govern their bodies, and those who truly cherish the world do not govern the world. All that the ancient sage-kings called benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music were not the means by which they governed. How much less so all the systems of punishments, names, laws, and stratagems!

Therefore, his writings speak only of *Dao/virtue* and *de* (power) and do not speak of benevolence and righteousness—for even if benevolence were without action, it would still not be entirely without action, and righteousness, when put into practice, would be even more so. Thus, his *Way* is:

To take emptiness as the norm,
To take action as the guiding principle,
To take gentle submission and non-contention as the sovereign of all things,
To take delight in war and killing as a necessity,
To regard victory as not beautiful,
To regard retreat as advancement,
To regard defeat as achievement,
To regard fortune as misfortune,
To regard gain as loss,
To regard ignorance as wisdom,
To regard desirelessness as desire,
To regard namelessness as name—
Who would say that non-action is insufficient for governing the world?

The world has yet to know the benefits of non-action.

But then, why does *Han Fei* love it? He says:

*"To follow and achieve is the governance of the emperor-king.
To oppose and yet endure is the art of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
To follow and achieve is to govern with a heart that does not endure, enacting policies that do not endure—
Thus, when one follows events with benevolence and applies policies with flexibility, only then can one achieve universal harmony without coercion. Its effects cannot be demanded overnight.

To oppose and yet endure is to make the desirable unseen—
Thus, there is no governance that is not achieved, yet no heart can be discerned in its workings;
No subject is unsettled, yet no virtue can be praised in it—
Such is all there is to it.

This is the most easy, most subtle *Way*, yet it is what all those who seek quick results and profit revere.
But those who seek profit and results wish to emulate it and yet cannot—
Thus, they cannot endure desirelessness but endure killing;
They cannot endure self-restraint but endure inflicting it on others;
They cannot endure endurance but endure not enduring.

Scholars, failing to discern its source, doubt its origin and say, ‘The calamity of *Dao/virtue* is that it later became *Shen Buhai* and *Han Fei*.’

If this is so, then indeed *Dao/virtue* later became *Shen Buhai* and *Han Fei*.
Yet why not say that the calamity of benevolence and righteousness was fratricide and regicide?

Many schools of learning have existed since antiquity—
After one or two transmissions, they are lost, and their harm is incalculable. How few are there?

Alone, Laozi?

From this perspective, it can be said that *Shen Buhai* and *Han Fei* originally followed the intent of *Dao/virtue*—how can this not be granted?

My nature is rigid, and my *qi* suffers from excessive firmness, unable to restrain itself.
I enjoy reading *Han Fei’s* works, yet I dare not again let the *Dao/virtue* tradition bring about calamity.
But because of *Dao/virtue*, I deeply appreciate it and have composed this commentary and preface to reflect on my own words regarding *Dao/virtue*.

The gentleman’s name was *Li Zàifáng*, a native of *Wēnlíng*. He held office as the Prefect of *Yà’ān* before retiring.
*Laozi’s* *Yì* (Wing) Volume Three.
*Laozi’s* *Yì* (Wing) *Kǎo Yì* (Examination of Differences)."

「Among the ancient books that have come down to the ages and been altered by men, there are many—but none more so than Laozi. In the Kaiyuan annotation, it is explicitly stated that I alone differ from others in valuing "seeking food from the mother" (i.e., nourishment from the Dao/Way) over the two characters "there is no seeking." The additions made by later scholars are reckless and do not reflect the original intent of Laozi’s text. How numerous are these alterations?

Sima Qian wrote that Laozi’s book contained over five thousand words, but this was merely an approximation. Some have gone so far as to arbitrarily delete auxiliary words just to fit the five thousand count—this is the misfortune caused by Sima Qian’s single remark.

Master Xue Jun (采氏) compiled *Laozi’s* *Ji* (Collection) *and Jie* (Exegesis), separately creating a section titled *Kǎo Yì* (Examination of Differences) appended to it. However, the sources he consulted were only about ten in number. I have seen many more scrolls and volumes, with numerous discrepancies. What he arranged for me is already recorded in the orthodox text, while the rest he attached to the end of the volume, still calling it *Kǎo Yì*. Let those who love antiquity verify this.

**Chapter Two:**
*This evil is already complete*—all know that goodness is goodness,
So the presence and absence of things give rise to one another.
All things are born from this, yet it does not claim credit.
It accomplishes its work yet does not dwell on it.

**Chapter Three:**
*Only by not dwelling on it*—

**Chapter Four:**
*Empty* yet never full,
Chaotic yet profound,
Mingled yet clear—
I do not know whose child it is.

**Chapter Five:**
*Not bent* yet much heard.

**Chapter Six:**
The root of Heaven and Earth—

**Chapter Seven:**
Heaven and Earth endure long.
Heaven and Earth endure long because of this—
Thus they can long endure.
Is it not because they have no selfishness?

**Chapter Eight:**
Yet they do not contend,
Dwelling where others find fault—
Thus they are guarded by the Dao/Way.
The benevolent one is thus faultless.

**Chapter Nine:**
*Hold* and grasp, yet sharpen it—
Long preserve it, filling the hall,
Proud—
Work accomplished, name secured, yet withdraw.

**Chapter Ten:**
*Embrace* without letting go,
Can one be like an infant?
Nurture and cherish it.

**Chapter Eleven:**
*Consolidate*—

---
*(Note: Some passages are fragmentary due to the nature of the original text. The bracketed annotations indicate variant readings in different manuscripts.)*

**Chapter Thirteen:**
What is this called favor and insult as if they were a shock?
Favor is the lower; insult is the higher.
This is how I have great misfortune—
When I have no body,
What misfortune could I have?
Thus, one who values his body as the world
Can entrust the world with love.

**Chapter Fourteen:**
These three things—
Therefore they blend and become one.
Above and below guard each other—
*Ah!*—without form.
This is called **hunlong** [惚怳].

To be simple is like being a guest;
To be open is like releasing something;
To be earnest is like being plain.
Empty—like a valley;
Turbulent—like mud.
Calm—like still water;
Slow—like clarity emerging.
Steady for long—
Thus one can wear out without renewal.

**Chapter Sixteen:**
Observe its return—
Calm, it is called "returning to the Way."
*Yunyun*—
Each returns to its root.
The public is the king; the king is Heaven.
Thus one can perish without danger.

**Chapter Seventeen:**
Do not know it yet love it;
Next, it is slighted.
Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.
*You!*—how precious is your speech!
When matters are accomplished—

**Chapter Eighteen:**
Discarded are the filial and kind,
The loyal and upright.

**Chapter Nineteen:**
These three things are used as ornament—
Yet they are not enough.

**Chapter Twenty:**
*Ah!*—how vast and boundless it is!
Like receiving a guest,
Like ascending a spring platform.
*Ah!*—how fearsome!
*Yingying!*—how murky!
*Dun dun!*—how dim,
As if without end.
Different from others—
How precious is food!

**Chapter Twenty-One:**
*Hunlong!*—
Within it, there is form.
Its essence is very true.

**Chapter Twenty-Two:**
Straight—
Is this not an empty claim?

**Chapter Twenty-Three:**
Thus the gusting wind does not last a morning.
Who causes this? Heaven and Earth—
Those who follow **virtue** align with **virtue**,
Those who lose **virtue** align with loss.
Those who align with the Dao/Way—
The Dao/Way also delights in this.
Trust is insufficient.

**Chapter Twenty-Four:**
*Qi* [跂]—
