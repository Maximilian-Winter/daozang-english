**The Collated *Classic of Great Peace*: Excerpts from Scroll A of the *Digest of the Classic of Great Peace* – The Primordial Origins of the Determinative Methods for the Lineage of Worthy and Sage Beings, Established by the August Thearch of the Golden Watchtower, the Posterior Sage Thearch, the Master and Preceptor, According to the Cyclical Revolutions of the Era and the Ebb and Flow of Balanced Qi**

**Question:** "The Three Sequences turn like a wheel, with departures and arrivals. The people must have a sovereign. May their surname and given name be known?"

**Answer:** "Excellent! Why do you ask this again?"

**Questioner:** "Illustrious masters are rarely encountered, and propitious moments pass swiftly. Overcome with longing, I venture to inquire. Though dull and presumptuous, my reverence runs deep."

**Answer:** "Ah! This is no presumption. Heaven impels your question to enlighten later generations. Those who awaken now discern the true and cast off the false. Were I to remain silent, I would fear Heaven’s sorrow, lest chaos go unchecked in its time. Sit at ease, and I shall expound it for you. You will then understand clearly, without doubt.

Of old, Heaven and Earth and today’s Heaven and Earth share the same beginning and end, no different. First good, then evil; in between, rise and decline, success and failure. The *yang* nine and hundred-six complete their cycle, and when six nines make a full revolution, great dissolution follows. Heaven and Earth merge in chaos, and all beings dissolve into ruin. Only those who accumulate goodness escape, becoming the *zhongmin* (Seed People) for all time.

The wisdom and understanding of the *zhongmin* still vary in degree, not yet perfectly unified. Thus, they still require a *jun* (sovereign) and *shi* (master). When the sovereign is sagely and the master enlightened, their teachings confer immortality. Through cultivation, they attain sagehood—hence the name *zhongmin*. The *zhongmin* are the kindred of sages and worthies who attain long life.

The Great Sovereign of Long Life is titled the *True and Upright Supreme Unity Wondrous Qi of Great Peace*, the *August Thearch of the Upper Clarity Golden Watchtower*, the *Posterior Sage Ninefold Mystery Thearch*. His surname is Li. He is the descendant of the *Highest Supreme*, the scion of the *Jade Thearch’s* Void and Nothingness. During the era of the *Mysterious Origin Thearch*, in the fifteenth year of the *Great August* reign, the year *bingzi* (3rd Celestial Stem, 1st Earthly Branch) saw the first stirrings of his *qi*. In the first year of the *August Peace* reign, *jiashen* (21st Celestial Stem, 9th Earthly Branch), he took form. In the seventh year of the *Upper Harmony* reign, *gengyin* (27th Celestial Stem, 3rd Earthly Branch), on the third day of the ninth month, the day *jiazi* (1st Celestial Stem, 1st Earthly Branch) at the hour *mao* (5th Earthly Branch, 5–7 a.m.), when *xing* (punishment) and *de* (virtue) mutually restrained one another, at the precise moment of conjunction, he was born in the *Northern Mystery Jade Kingdom*, the *Heavenly Ridge Spirit Realm*, within the *Human-Bird Pavilion* on *Mount Penglai*, amidst the *Li Valley*. His mother was the *Mysterious Void Mother of the Upper Mystery*, a chamber of the *Nine Mysteries*, dwelling in the valley’s shade.

At the onset of the *Mysterious Void Mother’s* conception, she dreamed of dark clouds and sun and moon entwining her form, while the lightning of the Six *Qi* stirred her spirit. In profound resonance with the *Yang* Dao, she conceived the Perfected One. On the dawn of his birth, three suns rose in the east. After his nurturing, nine dragons spat forth divine water. Thus, his clan took its name from the *Spirit Valley*, and his given name from the radiance of the luminaries.

At the age of three, his body embodied the Dao and congealed the true, his words blossoming like golden flowers. At five, he often gazed at the sun, rejoicing in its dawn, and faced the moon, sighing at its end. Above, he observed the brilliance of *yang* *qi*; below, he beheld the waning and decay of the *yin* path. Thereupon, he gathered his *hun* and harmonized his *po*, guarded the precious spirit of the womb, recorded his essence, replenished his blood, and fortified his fluids to solidify his sinews.

At seven, he learned to swallow light and ingest rosy clouds, chewing the roots of the sun. At fourteen (two sevens), he possessed a golden countenance and jade visage, abandoning worldly attachments and severing mundane passions. He embraced transformation to save the world, his essence resonating with the *Great Simplicity*. He received the teachings of the *Three Origins*, studied the *Three Caverns*, and mastered the *Nine Methods*.

At twenty-one (three sevens), he dwelled in solitude, tempering his sharpness. At twenty-eight (four sevens), he harmonized with the world, blending his light. At thirty-five (five sevens), he disseminated the *Mysterious Ford*, his merit and virtue spreading far and wide. At forty-two (six sevens), he received the scriptures and was named *Posterior Sage Thearch*. This was no different from those who had attained the Dao and become Thearchs in former heavens. His investiture was recorded for the present age—hence the title *Posterior Sage*. The Dao of the Former Sage and the Posterior Sage is one and the same.

He ascended to the halls of *Upper Clarity*, wandered the palaces of the *Great Ultimate*, and governed the ten directions of Heaven. He was enfeoffed to oversee the billions upon billions of beings, inspecting all the celestial rivers and seas, the earth’s sources and mountain forests. None failed to look up in obedience. He presided over the nine layers and ten tiers—hence the title *Ninefold Mystery*.

At seventy, he determined the boundless span of his life, adapting to the fitting times of concealment and manifestation. He edited the arts of deathlessness and composed the methods of long life. Treasuring the scriptures, talismans, and diagrams, the wondrous methods of the Three Antiquities, he sealed them in jade caskets, attended by divine officials. Their transmission followed strict protocols, their practice and concealment governed by signs. He established canons and bestowed them upon the *zhongmin*. Those who cannot practice them are not *zhongmin*.

Now, as Heaven and Earth unfold, the pure wind recedes into the distance. The *August Peace* *qi* withdraws, and calamities surge unchecked. Since the era of the *Upper August*, through the Three and Five Dynasties, warfare, epidemics, floods, and fires have arisen in relentless succession. All stem from the billions of beings whose hearts are perverse and forms deceitful, who rupture the Five Virtues and contend with the Six Passions, indulging in violence and aggression, mutually encroaching upon one another. Noble and base, elder and younger, exalted and humble—all are thrown into chaos and separation.

Thus, the Two Modes lose their order, the Seven Luminaries deviate from their courses, the Three Powers undergo strange transformations, and omens and portents proliferate. Spirits and ghosts inflict harm, beings and creatures wither and perish. Disasters and misfortunes follow one upon another. Yet, none awaken or repent. Myriad poisons rage unchecked, beyond counting.

There are Four Great Evils: war, disease, flood, and fire. When the *yang* nine completes a cycle, and solitary *yin* flourishes, waters overflow. When the hundred-six completes a revolution, and *yang* prevails, fires erupt. Before the time of Yao, there is no need to recount further. From the Tang onward, I shall briefly set forth the present age."

Let all earnestly remember and swiftly prepare defenses. After the floods of Yao came the fires of Tang, and thereafter, small-scale floods and fires spread across the land—calamities summoned by grave sins, yet not the great *yang* nine or great hundred-six cycles. Within these great nine-six cycles, there must be great and small *jia-shen* years. The *jia-shen* marks the time when ghosts confront humanity.

Disasters vary in severity, as blessings and sins differ in weight. Since years and lands differ, their shifts are not uniform. For those of middling virtue, the appointed time arrives as foretold. For those above or below the mean, they may rise or fall, advance or retreat, ascend or descend without fixed course. Evil hastens ruin; goodness prolongs life. Without diligent progress, the Dao cannot be attained. One may only extend the appointed time in proportion to the merit accrued.

Thus, the hundred-six and *yang* nine cycles may arrive early or late, their great calendric constants adjusted by depth of transgression. Counting from the *ding-hai* year of the Tang era, forty-six years pass. Within this span, the *jia-shen* year is a lesser *jia-shen*, bringing war, disease, and fire in alternating disasters—yet no great flood. Minor floods surge widely, their severity varying by year and land.

Fifty-five years later, another *ding-hai* arrives. Within its span falls another *jia-shen* year, this a great *jia-shen* when all three disasters strike together, compounded by a great flood’s sweeping force. Whenever great or small *jia-shen* years come, the wicked are eradicated, and the good are delivered. The good become the *seed people*; the wicked become the *chaos*.

Before long, myriad omens arise in tumult. Epidemics and poisons surge from above; war and fire rage below. Floodwaters burst forth from no fixed direction, and the wicked perish in turn. For fifteen years—even up to thirty—annual disasters intensify, and the worthy and sagely go into hiding. The Great Dao and divine beings dispatch perfected immortals and superior adepts to traverse the land, guiding with patient instruction. They exhort the high and urge on the low. Those who follow become the *seed people*; those who refuse are submerged, becoming *chaos*. The wicked are utterly swept away. Of the *seed people*, the most virtuous—one in ten—remain. Of the middling and lesser good, half are destroyed by Heaven, while the surviving half flourish and grow day by day. Then, a sagely ruler and enlightened master, with great ministers, descend and manifest.

After the lesser *jia-shen* and before the *ren-shen*, the ruler of the lesser *jia-shen* is sagely and wise, stern yet benevolent, causing no harm or disorder. He extends years and prolongs life, and through devoted study, one may attain immortality. Yet he cannot deeply study the *Scriptures of Great Peace* nor long practice the affairs of Great Peace. The names of those who briefly achieve Great Peace cannot be fixed.

Those who practice it have their names inscribed in the Azure Register by the Director of Destinies; those who do not are recorded in the Black Writ. The Black Writ means death; the Azure Register means life. The ledgers of life and death reside in the Heavenly Hall of Light. The Dao of Heaven is impartial, favoring only the good. Those who cultivate Great Peace bring it to fruition. Achieving Lesser Great Peace, they align their virtue with the Lord of Great Peace.

The Lord of Great Peace, whose name is fixed, is Lord Li. In the *ren-chen* year, on the sixth day of the third month, he will manifest openly, riding the Three Pure Radiant Chariot, followed by ten thousand flying carriages and dragons. He will elevate the good as *seed people* and scholars as immortal officials. He will establish examinations and statutes, rewarding goodness and suppressing evil, cutting off the roots of sin, and urging those who cultivate blessed deeds to progress without slack. Through diligence, they will attain divine perfection and align their virtue with the Emperor. Those who slacken and fall into evil will have their names daily recorded in the ledgers of wickedness, destined to become *chaos*.

Scholars and lofty scholars, wise and enlightened, thoroughly clear and without doubt, diligently refine their progress, preserving and practicing the Emperor’s teachings, ever mindful of the great divine Lords’ assistance—none dare forget.

The sagely Lord and his luminous aides, the numinous officials, protect the people, who thereby attain deathlessness and remain forever as *seed people*. Ascending as immortal officials of the perfected, they ultimately attain the rank of *Later Sage*. The *Later Sage* Lord Li’s Grand Preceptor bears the surname Peng. He studied the Dao before Lord Li and held the position of Left Perfected of the Grand Tenuity. During the era of the Human Sovereign, he safeguarded the Dao Lord of the Emperor and was regularly commanded to confer investiture upon the multitudes, serving as Grand Preceptor to Lord Li. His governance resides in the Northern Pond Palace of the Grand Tenuity, upon the Numinous Upper Radiance Terrace. Every two thousand five hundred years, he transforms his name, traversing the Great Void and circling the Eight Obscurities—ascending to the Utmost Above, descending to the Utmost Below. Few among the perfected officials have ever beheld his radiant countenance.

The *Later Sage* Lord Li’s Chief Minister is the Azure Lad of the Fangzhu Palace.
The *Later Sage* Lord Li’s Chief Guardian is the Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen of the Great Cinnabar Palace.
The *Later Sage* Lord Li’s Chief Instructor is the Grand Simplicity Perfected of the White Mountain Palace.
The *Later Sage* Lord Li’s Chief Steward is the Governor of the Perfected of the Western Citadel Palace.

The five persons above: one preceptor and four aides.

The aides are fathers, supporters. They are revered as fathers, and through their support, the Way is enacted—thus they are collectively called *aides*. When distinguished by position: left aide and right assistant, front advisor and rear attendant.

The *attendant* voices proposals and initiates affairs, fills omissions and completes matters, enacts judgments and proclaims decrees—this is the *steward*. The *advisor* ponders what is not yet grasped, illuminates and brings to clarity—this is the *instructor*. The *assistant* settles uncertainties and resolves doubts—this is the *guardian*. The one who *supports the lord and follows the preceptor*, encompassing all to enter the Dao—this is the *chief minister*.

Through the four and five phases of divination, they together deliberate right and wrong, aiding and magnifying the true transformation—thus they are called *aides to the preceptor*. In moments of leisure, when facing doubts ahead, one inquires of the *instructor*. When looking back and fearing omissions, one inquires of the *attendant*. When something on the right remains obscure, one inquires of the *assistant*. When something on the left is not yet clear, one inquires of the *aide*. Consulting the four aides—guardian, instructor, steward, and minister—success depends upon the preceptor; none may be lacking. The sagely emperor set this model for later generations to follow.

Inwardly, there is the *guardian*, who attends to affairs—this pertains to the right, the treasure of quiescent truth. Outwardly, there is the *preceptor*, who attends to affairs—this pertains to the left, where movement returns to stillness. This is most difficult, and so the discussion of aides and ministers has centered on the preceptor.

Ahead, there is the *instructor*, who expounds teachings and discusses principles. Behind, there is the *steward*, who decides and judges right and wrong. Beyond these, there are three hundred sixty-one officials—ducal ministers, bureau chiefs, transcendents, sagely ranks, and great officers—with thirty-six thousand under their command, leading thirty-six myriad, while the people number ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and myriadfold more.

Twenty-four perfected persons are ever dispatched to secretly instruct those of sincere heart, all subordinate to the Chief Minister of the Fangzhu Palace. This cannot be fully recounted; one must carefully preserve the great and personally investigate the small.

"Excellent! Today my doubts have been questioned, and I have heard the command anew."

The disciple asked: "What constant practices did Lord Li undertake to attain this rank of High Perfected? May I hear of the studies of the Grand Preceptor and the Four Assistants?"

"Excellent! You are one of the deluded—lost in disbelief of the Dao, your learning unsteady, advancing and retreating without constancy, sinking into lowliness and suffering—thus you earnestly inquire. Now I shall tell you.

From time without beginning, deeds have accumulated over ages—every good and every evil cannot be fully recounted, and speaking of them brings no benefit. I shall speak only of recent practices that led to attaining nobility through the numinous scriptures and purple texts, which are essential.

It begins with the Eastern Flower Jade Guardian, the High Dawn Master, the Azure Lad Great Lord. The Great Lord purified himself in the Cold Numinous Elixir Hall, within the Yellow Chamber, for three years, then ascended to the Golden Portals of Supreme Purity. There, the Four Celestial Emperors reside, with the Grand Lord of the Peaceful Dao at their side.

He dwells in the Jade Tower of the Great Void, in the Cavern-Real Palace, the Level Jade Chamber, within the Golden Flower. Five myriad attendant perfected maidens surround him. Poisonous dragons and lightning tigers, simian sentinels of the heavens, array themselves in venomous postures, guarding the gates and thresholds. Serpents a thousand fathoms long patrol the walls. Flying dragons and darting sparrows, leviathan roc and strange birds—clashing beaks and brandishing talons—fill the vast courtyard."

The celestial majesty blazes with radiance, its streaming light illuminating the eight directions. The winds stir the dark banners, whirling the feathered canopies in dance. Jade trees ring with resonant tones, their gem-like branches murmuring of their own accord. A chorus of divine songs arises, phoenixes sing in profound harmony. Divine consorts join their voices in unison, qilins dance and simurghs stride forth. The celestial harmony resounds in eightfold echoes, the ninefold concord unites in a hundredfold assembly.

The Azure Lad prostrates himself and advances, entreating to receive the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text* and the twenty-four oral transmissions and esoteric instructions contained within the scriptures:

1. The True Record of Attentiveness—profoundly memorized in darkness;
2. The Prohibitions of Immortals—carefully observed without forgetfulness;
3. Gathering the flying root and swallowing the essence of the sun;
4. Ingesting the *Luminous Numinous Talisman*;
5. Ingesting the radiance of the moon;
6. Ingesting the *Yin-Generated Talisman*;
7. Restraining the three *hun*;
8. Controlling the seven *po*;
9. Wearing the *August Image Talisman*;
10. Ingesting the *Flowering Elixir*;
11. Ingesting the *Yellow Water*;
12. Ingesting the *Returning Water*;
13. Consuming *Ringed Steel*;
14. Consuming *Phoenix Brain*;
15. Consuming *Pine Pears*;
16. Consuming *Plum Dates*;
17. Ingesting *Water Decoction*;
18. Stabilizing *White Silver and Purple Gold*;
19. Ingesting *Cloud Fat*;
20. Crafting *White Silver and Purple Gold*;
21. Crafting *Stabilizing Talismans*;
22. Consuming *Bamboo Shoots*;
23. Consuming *Swan Jerky*;
24. Wearing the *Five Spirit Talismans*.

Mastering these twenty-four practices, one’s transformations become boundless, transcending beyond the Three Realms and roaming freely within the Six Directions. Calamities and harm cannot injure them; demons and evil dare not oppose them. All submit of their own accord, and one’s rank attains the ultimate in the Daoist lineage, bestowing grace upon all beings, both hidden and manifest, who rely upon it.

Those who do not believe, do not follow, do not know, or do not perceive choose darkness for themselves, forever estranged from the Dao. They wallow in suffering, poison, and affliction, drowned in the turbid mire of vexation. Yet the great compassion remains, though nothing can be done for them.

Alas! Noble scholars of aspiration, reflect early—reflect early! Do not betray these words of today.

The disciple said: "Excellent! Excellent! Today my doubts are resolved, and I have heard your command anew."

[Preserved] In *First Scroll of Jia Section* it states: "Scholars who study and apply this scripture will trace its roots to their source. The root and its fundamental lineage take the Three Ones as their master."

*Daoist Meaning Compendium*, Scroll 2, *Seven Sections of Meaning*, and *Cloudy Satchel Seven Signs*, Scroll 64, *Auxiliary Excerpts*, both cite this.

[Preserved] *First Scroll of Jia Section* further states: "Those who recite my scripture will find calamities and harm do not arise. This is the very text by which the ancient sages and worthies discerned success and failure." It also says: "Scriptures are of three ranks: first, the *Scriptures of the Divine Dao*; second, the *Verified Records of Affairs*; third, the *Superficial Ornamental Records*.

The *Scriptures of the Divine Dao* are those that abide in undivided essence, firmly guard the root, harmonize with yin and yang, and share the same gate as the spirits. The *Verified Records of Affairs* verify the similarities and differences of events, ensuring no errors or doubts remain. The *Superficial Ornamental Records* have strayed far from the root, are disordered, and cannot be relied upon constantly; they may be noted from time to time, hence their name."

It further states: "To pacify great chaos, merit must be lofty and virtue upright—thus it is called *Great Peace*. If this Dharma spreads and prevails, it is the era of Great Peace. Therefore, this scripture says: it manifests in response to conditions and conceals itself once the matter is complete."

It also says: "Sagely rulers govern with reverence for these texts; ordinary lords on the throne treat this canon with neglect."

*Cloudy Satchel Seven Signs*, Scroll 64, *Auxiliary Excerpts*, cites this. The three ranks of scriptures are also found in *Excerpts from the Scripture of Great Peace, Gui Section*. According to the Dunhuang catalog, it should belong to *Jia Section*.

[Preserved] *Scroll Eight of the Great Peace Section*, *Laozi’s Transmission of Scriptures, Precepts, Rituals, and Oral Instructions*, states: "Laozi is the great sage who attained the Dao, the teacher revered by both the hidden and the manifest. When conditions call, he transforms and adapts to all directions; when his work is complete, he withdraws and abides in concealment. Where he abides is not a fixed abode. The abode of non-abiding abides in the *Ultimate*. The ultimate of the Ultimate is the *Supreme Mystery*. The *Supreme Mystery* is the capital where the Supreme Ancestral Ultimate resides. Laozi dwells here, his transformations responding to the ten directions. The marvels of his teachings extend to the farthest reaches, beyond all description.

In a recent manifestation, he appeared at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, descending to blend his light with the world. Born among the common people, he demonstrated gestation and birth to show that the truth can be learned. Though he lived in lowly circumstances, he repeatedly attained the Dao. He roamed the Six Voids and taught the Three Realms, mastering both the Dharma beyond the world and the Dharma within it, as well as all practices of action and inaction.

During the time of King Wen, he served as the Keeper of Archives. Some say he lived in the world for over two hundred years. In the forty-third year of King Ping’s reign, the year *gui-chou* (601 BCE), on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month, he expounded the *Five Thousand Character Scripture* to Guanling Yin Xi."

*Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns*, Scroll 9, *Laozi as the Emperor’s Teacher*, cites this.

[Note: This account of Laozi’s deeds may derive from *Scroll Eight of the Scripture of Great Peace*. However, *Cloudy Satchel Seven Signs*, Scroll 40, *Exhortations*, cites *Scroll Eight of the Supreme Mystery Section*, *Lao Jun’s Transmission of Scriptures, Precepts, Rituals, and Oral Instructions*, with identical scroll numbers and titles. Thus, *Great Peace* and *Supreme Mystery* must contain an error—this is provisionally preserved for further investigation.]

*Collated and Annotated Scripture of Great Peace*, Scrolls 18–34, *Yi Section* (unbound)
*Excerpts from the Scripture of Great Peace, Yi Section*

To harmonize yin and yang and follow the Dao’s method is to return to youth and avoid aging. When the Great Dao is about to return, all people’s years will show signs of verification. Close your eyes and look inward—pure white radiance will appear. If it is early morning, your body should rest calmly upon the mat. If you sit in warmth and steam, at this time your sinews and bones should not move, nor should your mouth speak. Every stretch and bend brings increasing comfort; the heart rejoices, suffused with a sense of blending and moisture. The nose breathes freely, and sweetness arises in the mouth—these are the signs.

Thus, those who follow Heaven and Earth enjoy enduring governance. Those who follow the four seasons see their kingship flourish day by day. The Dao has no arcane phrases—its function lies in the alternation of yin and yang. Those who attain its governance prosper; those who lose it fall into chaos. Those who attain its governance become spiritually luminous; those who lose it find the Dao unworkable. Ponder this meaning deeply, and you will merge with the Dao.

**Method for Aligning the Body and Rectifying the Spirit**
When Heaven employs the Dao to generate humans, each person receives one method and one body, with seven interwoven yin and yang. Only when half yin and half yang combine can they achieve completion. Thus, the upper part models itself on yang, the lower on yin; the left follows yang, the right follows yin. Yang delights in life, yin delights in killing. Yang embodies the Dao, yin embodies punishment. Yang embodies goodness, and yang spirits assist it; yin embodies evil, and yin spirits assist it. Accumulating goodness without cease, the Dao’s blessings arise, bringing daily fortune.

Yang resides in the head, yin in the feet. Thus, rulers value virtue and power while employing punishment below—this is the model to follow. Petty persons invert this, placing punishment above and virtue below, yet they too follow this model. Therefore, humans are the root and handle of the Dao, the overseers of spirits. One must understand this intent and skillfully nurture oneself to attain longevity. Failing to nurture the body properly incurs the blame of all spirits. If spirits abandon a person, how can the body fare well?

In doing good, one must not deviate from the guiding cord nor deceive oneself. Whether doing good or evil, the spirits know it of themselves—not other spirits, but the spirits within one’s own body. Words emerge from the heart and belly, yet others come to know them—this is the spirits within the body informing them. Thus, calming the spirit and settling the body is the foundation of governance and the sign of longevity. The practice of non-action arises from this. First cultivate the self to discern fortune and misfortune.

Therefore, the wise and enlightened focus on cultivating the self rather than others. By deeply pondering the Dao’s intent, they achieve Great Peace. The noble person uses this to flourish; the petty person employs it to collapse.

**Method for Cultivating Oneness to Repel Evil**
When Heaven and Earth first opened, the root was prized—it is the origin of qi. To bring about Great Peace, one must contemplate the root. Failing to reflect on the root is called great vexation; undertakings will not succeed, and disasters will converge. This is not human fault but the loss of the root’s foundation. Seeking the branches while abandoning the root brings untreatable calamity—thus, one must ponder this deeply.

The One is the root of the Dao, the beginning of qi, the tether of life, and the master of all hearts. To know its reality, recognize that it resides in the center as the root, the palace of life. Therefore, one must deeply understand it and return to benevolence and worthiness to put it into practice.

The human root lies within, while branches and leaves are external. Command the One to return all externals inward, urgently tending to the internal. Pursue the distant and govern the near. Those who guard the One receive the assistance of heavenly spirits. Those who guard two receive the assistance of earthly spirits. Those who guard three receive the assistance of human ghosts. Those who guard four or five receive the protection of things.

Thus, guarding the One extends life; guarding two sets a date with misfortune. Guarding three brings chaotic governance; guarding four or five invites daily disaster. Deeply pondering this meaning is called knowing the Dao.

Therefore, the One of the head is the crown. The One of the seven regulators is the eye. The One of the abdomen is the navel. The One of the vessels is qi. The One of the five viscera is the heart. The One of the four limbs is the palms and soles. The One of the bones is the spine. The One of the flesh is the intestines and stomach. By firmly guarding it and understanding the Dao’s intent, those who attain the Dao become benevolent, while those who lose it become greedy.

**Method for Using Music to Repel Disaster**
Use music to govern the body, preserve form, follow thoughts, and focus the mind to repel disaster. What is the purpose of delighting in the Dao? Joy harmonizes yin and yang. In all matters, act in silence, enabling people to grasp the Dao’s root.

When primordial qi delights, great prosperity arises. When nature delights, things grow strong. When Heaven delights, the Three Luminaries shine. When Earth delights, it achieves constancy. When the Five Phases delight, they do not harm one another. When the four seasons delight, what they generate flourishes. When rulers delight, the world knows no illness. When crawling creatures delight, they do not harm one another. When the myriad things delight, they abide in constancy. When people delight, they do not fret or change their hearts. When ghosts and spirits delight, they benefit the emperor.

Thus, music is formed from the essence of Heaven and Earth’s good qi, summoning divine luminosity. Stillness generates radiance, and radiance is the means to await the spirits. By communicating with the divine luminosity and having the Dao as a neighbor, one attains long life and enduring existence.

Those who seek the Dao often suffer, unable to return their thoughts to the mind. Now, by transforming customs and redirecting intentions, who can contend with them?

Does the music of Great Peace emerge from the palace to expel evil? It firmly purifies the state, secures the body’s entry into the Dao, repels barbarians, and summons auspicious responses from spirits. Celestial images return, and malevolent spirits depart.

The human spirit is born within but wanders outside. If it does not return in time, it harms the body. By recalling it, one can govern oneself without failure. How to recall it? Ensure an empty room with no one nearby. Draw an image matching the viscus’s color, corresponding to the four seasons’ qi, and hang it in the window’s light while contemplating it.

Above is the image of the viscera; below are the ten villages. When lying down, focus on the nearby hanging image and contemplate it without cease. The spirits of the five viscera can report the twenty-four seasonal qi, and the spirits of the Five Phases will come to the rescue. All illnesses will be cured.

Men should contemplate male images, women should contemplate female images, all measured by a standard of one *chi*, adapting with the turning of the four seasons. In spring, ten azure lads; in summer, ten crimson lads; in autumn, ten white lads; in winter, ten black lads; and in the four seasons’ transitions, twelve yellow lads. The twenty-five spirit-persons and perfected ones together embody the Dao and virtue. When the proper method is practiced, yang transforms into yin, and yin transforms into yang; when yin and yang unite, the Dao may be enacted.

Heaven requires earth to bring forth life, and earth requires heaven to bring things to completion. Spring and summer require autumn and winter; day requires night; the ruler requires ministers to achieve governance. Ministers require the ruler to carry out their duties. Thus, *jia* requires *yi*, and *zi* requires *chou*—all complete one another. To enact the Dao and govern rightly is to follow heaven’s course, which does not conform to human desires; to act otherwise is to go against the heavenly Dao. It is like the Eastern Sea, lying low and fond of water, to which all rivers return. By attaining its Dao, leviathans emerge from its depths, and luminous moon-pearls are born—such is the efficacy of obtaining the Dao. When Daoists gather, methods for extending years and wondrous formulas emerge, and great auspicious responses arise. When the worthy gather, governance becomes peaceful; when scholars gather, minor disorders are resolved; when the five weapons gather, great defeat ensues.

The ruler should uphold the Dao, and ministers should uphold virtue. Dao and virtue are like the outer and inner layers of a garment. If heaven were not vast, it could not contain the myriad things. All things are half good and half bad; one must endure both. The ruler models this, as does the empress in the rear palace. These two exemplify the way of compassionate parents. Thus, when parents raise children, they love the good and pity the bad, and only then can the household be harmonious.

The sun symbolizes the ruler, the moon the great ministers, and the stars the hundred officials. When the worthy shine together, the myriad things live in harmony. Thus, the clear belongs to heaven, the turbid to earth, and harmony to humanity.

**Method for Harmonizing Spirit-Souls**
I wish to make the ten thousand spirits of the world harmonious and kind, so they no longer recklessly harm people. Heaven and earth will rejoice for long, all spirits will be pleased, and people will suffer nothing. When the emperor obtains heaven’s power, all undertakings are blessed—how could this be interrupted?

**Arising**
Thus, when the sage abides in the Dao and stillness, at dawn they eat, and all spirits call out and speak to them, just as people today call to guests.

**Ceasing**
The hundred spirits say they are heaven’s officials and envoys; the host of essences are earth’s officials and envoys; and the hundred ghosts are envoys of harmony. These three are the envoys of yin, yang, and harmony. They assist heaven and earth in governance and together bring benefit to the emperor.

**Method of Illuminating Unity**
**Arising**
The method of illuminating unity is the root of long life. It is the origin of the ten thousand spirits and the gateway to radiant light. When guarding unity with clarity, it is like fire at its inception—guard it urgently and do not lose it. At first it is truly red, in the end truly white, and after a long time truly azure. Profound clarity reaches the farthest extremes, then returns to govern unity, leaving nothing within unclear. All illnesses depart; guarding it without slack is the art of ten thousand years.

The method of illuminating unity possesses the brilliance of the rising sun and the clarity of midday.

**Ceasing**
This is the foremost good for attaining heaven’s longevity. Abide in tranquility and seclusion, and you will never err for ten thousand generations.

The method of guarding unity determines the excellence or inferiority of practicing the Dao. What is the Dao? It is the origin of the myriad things, yet it cannot be named. Within the six directions, nothing can transform without the Dao. Primordial qi enacts the Dao to generate the myriad things; great and small in heaven and earth are all born through the Dao. Thus, primordial qi is formless and governs the formed. To extend primordial qi, one must rely on the Dao to be born. The natural is the natural of the myriad things. Without practicing the Dao, one cannot envelop heaven and earth, nor can each attain its proper place, nor can the high be made unaware of danger.

Heaven practices the Dao day and night without rest, swifter than wind and rain, and still fears losing the Dao’s intent—how much more so for kings? The three luminaries practice the Dao without rest, thus they are fixed in the heavens and illuminate the eight directions. If they lose the Dao, their light vanishes. The king, the hundred officials, the myriad things, and all living beings dwell together, and the five stars observe their transgressions. When the king restores virtue, the virtue-star comes to guard him. When he acts with martiality, the martial-star comes to guard him. When he acts with gentleness, the gentle-star comes to guard him. When he acts with strength, the strong-star comes to guard him. When he acts with trustworthiness, the trustworthy-star comes to guard him. Though distant, their responses are near. Heaven and humanity are one—how could one not be cautious?

**Methods of Practicing the Dao with Excellence or Inferiority**
In spring, the king should be warm; in summer, hot; in autumn, cool; and in winter, cold—this is the king’s virtue. The king’s qi connects with the emperor’s qi; ministerial qi responds to the chief ministers; subtle qi responds to petty officials; resting qi aligns with the rear palace; declining qi responds to the people; and the qi of condemned prisoners responds to those in prison. They resonate from afar by kind.

If the Dao’s kingly qi does not arrive, the king’s grace cannot be bestowed. The ancient sage-kings pondered the Dao through this, thus discerning the signs of success and failure and examining their intent. When the king practices the Dao, heaven and earth rejoice; when he loses the Dao, heaven and earth send forth calamities and anomalies.

When the king stills his thoughts on the Dao and virtue, practices the Dao to secure his person, and seeks long life for self-cultivation, harmonizing the way of husband and wife so that yin and yang both attain their proper place, heaven and earth are at peace. Though heaven and the emperor are separated by ten thousand myriad *li*, they respond to the Dao—is this not wondrous? This is called *The Book of Divine Secrets*.

Primordial qi is natural and together forms the nature of heaven and earth. When the six directions and eight quarters are joyful, good responses arise; when they are not joyful, evil responses arise. Their forms resemble reflections, and their sounds harmonize with echoes.

The three qi—Great Yin, Great Yang, and Harmony—together govern, mutually influencing one another. Humanity is the pivot, and thus one must deeply understand this.

All know to value their lives and nurture their bodies, thus they know to honor their superiors and cherish their subordinates, delighting in life and abhorring death. When the three qi—Great Yin, Great Yang, and Harmony—are joyful, they unite as Supreme Harmony, and responses emerge in unison.

Yet when the worthy gather, they think only of the Way of longevity, thereby securing their ruler and becoming the state’s treasured vessel. To cultivate one’s nature is to cultivate one’s people.

Heaven bestows no private favor; its blessings are steadfast. The divine shows no partiality; the good are its reflection. Within a single person, one may become worthy, become divine, or become base—why is this? It is error, for the numinous is revealed. Thus the Way of Guarding the One is to nurture one’s nature, and this lies in learning.

Among the many, those who receive auspicious responses are trustworthy; those who receive none have erred in conduct. Through divination, right and wrong may be discerned. As the scale discerns weight, so human sentiment is weighed. Heaven’s illumination of man differs not from a mirror. Scrutinize this meaning, align your aspirations with heaven, and unite with the true spirits—how could misfortune arise?

In accomplishing affairs, not a fraction is lost, so as to attain the harmonious intent of heaven and earth. When heaven and earth are balanced, the myriad things are at peace; when the sovereign governs justly, the myriad people are well-ordered.

If one acts purely in yang, the earth will not willingly bring all to fruition; if purely in yin, heaven will not willingly bring all to life. Only when the Three Powers converge, when yin and yang are in accord, does harmony reside within.

The sages of antiquity who brought about Great Peace all sought the harmonious heart of heaven and earth. If one qi is obstructed, a hundred affairs go awry.

**Harmonizing the Three Qi to Establish the Imperial Law**
To penetrate the harmonious discourse of heaven and earth, to follow the great enterprise, to wander in harmony with the Three Qi—this is how the ruler remains without trouble, how the worthy all emerge to assist and exalt the emperor, bringing great joy to heaven.

The Perfected One asked the Divine One: *"I wish for the emperor to swiftly attain Great Peace—may I hear how?"*

The Divine One replied: *"〈Begin〉 Simply follow heaven and earth in full, not losing a fraction, and Great Peace will swiftly arrive, with auspicious responses arising together. Primordial qi has three names: Great Yang, Great Yin, and Harmony. Forms have three names: heaven, earth, and humanity. Heaven has three names: sun, moon, and stars, with the North Star as its center. Earth has three names: mountains, rivers, and level land. Humanity has three names: father, mother, and child. Governance has three names: ruler, minister, and people—all desiring Great Peace. These three must always be held close as heart and mind, not losing a fraction, sharing a single concern, uniting as one household. Then Great Peace will swiftly arrive, and longevity will be without doubt. 〈End〉*

Thus the male resembles heaven, and his thoughts turn to the female—this is the clear effect of heaven’s design. The minister resembles earth, ever desiring to ascend and unite in heart with heaven. Thus the myriad things, born from the earth, rise upward without cease, and clouds and qi fill the sky to form rain. So too the loyal minister’s concern is ever above, tirelessly mindful of his ruler—this is the clear effect of earth’s design.

The people embody the discourse of Harmony, for Harmony is what regulates the myriad things. Harmony is the infant, the child born of father and mother, whose life belongs to the father, whose lineage is above, yet who is nurtured by the mother. Thus in distress, they long for the ruler and father. These three mirror the images of husband and wife, father and child.

They should communicate freely, unite their strength, and share their concerns, so that the Three Qi merge into Supreme Harmony. From Supreme Harmony arises the qi of Great Peace. If these three qi are severed, even one obstruction prevents their flow, Supreme Harmony does not arrive, and Great Peace does not emerge.

Yin and yang depend on Harmony. When the qi of Harmony is attained, the myriad things flourish, the people are harmonious, and the king’s governance brings Great Peace.

The ruler is heaven; if his grace does not descend, things have no means to grow, and people cannot attain longevity. If the ruler’s heart is not open, heaven’s heart cannot reach below, and wife and child do not receive the father’s decree—this is a household in rebellion.

If the minister’s qi cannot ascend, earth’s qi cannot be fulfilled—how then can loyal ministers assist the enlightened king in governance? This wounds the heart of earth, leaving widows in their chambers, ever grieving and sorrowful, while worthy ministers have no means to advance.

If the people’s qi does not ascend, how can the qi of Harmony arise? Harmony must harmonize the ruler’s governance, regulating the myriad things so each attains its proper place. Now, if the Three Qi do not interact well, how can Great Peace be achieved?"

**The Law of the Peaceful and Joyous King**

The ruler must transform the myriad things through virtue and power, ensuring each attains its proper place. If one cannot transform and nurture the myriad things, one cannot be called a ruler. This is like a husband and wife who together bear a child and are thus called parents. Even as a household’s image, if they cannot produce a child, how can they be called parents? Therefore, those who cannot transform and give life to the myriad things cannot be called the parents of the people.

Thus, fire can transform the Four Elements and itself becomes the fifth, and so it is called the ruler’s image. Water’s nature is harmonious and concentrated, but when it meets fire, it scatters and turns to ash. Metal’s nature is hard and unyielding, but when it meets fire, it softens. Earth’s nature is greatly yielding, but when it meets fire, it hardens into tiles. Water’s nature is cold, but when it meets fire, it warms. Fire itself aligns with the Five Phases and can transform endlessly; its nature is active and ascends. Yin submits to yang, ministers submit to the ruler, and fire can illuminate and discern clearly, distinguishing right from wrong—thus it is called the ruler, while the others cannot.

Earth does not transform immediately but does so over time, and so it is called the Queen of Earth. The other three assist in their duties and are images of ministers. The Dao can transform all things without exception, so when primordial qi abides by the Dao, it circulates its qi, giving birth to heaven and earth. Though they stand without pillars, the myriad things arise without fixed categories, and their descendants continue in succession, speaking of categories. This is like grasses and trees growing on the earth—do they have categories? It is the primordial qi abiding by the Dao that generates them thus.

When all things naturally abide by the Dao and act accordingly, the myriad things each attain their proper place. When heaven abides by the Dao and acts, it is called spirit and has no fixed form, resembling the ruler and father of the people, able to govern and transform all things, truly embodying the Dao’s intent. When earth abides by the Dao and acts, the five directions unite with the center, and the myriad things return to it. When the Three Luminaries abide by the Dao and act, they illuminate all without exception. When thunder and lightning abide by the Dao and act, they can stir the world, riding the qi to come and go.

When the four seasons and Five Phases abide by the Dao and act, they can transform the myriad things, giving them constancy. When yin and yang, male and female abide by the Dao and act, they can transmit through the generations. In all matters, great or small, if they abide by the Dao and act, there will be no misfortune. If the Dao is lost today, great chaos will ensue. Thus, when yang is at peace, the myriad things naturally arise; when yin is at peace, the myriad things naturally mature.

When yin and yang govern through the Dao, they instruct their ministers, transform their people, receive their mandate from heaven, their form from earth, and their teachings from their teachers. Only then do they hear the essential Dao of the world. Those who guard the root become kings; those who guard the stem become ministers; those who guard the floating blossoms bring good but also chaos and inconstancy.

The emperor is the son of heaven; the empress is the daughter of earth—they are the first spiritual qi of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth always wish for joy and do not tolerate sorrow; they cherish them so deeply that the qi of heaven and earth’s heart is foremost. Thus, if the ruler is sorrowful, the qi of the four seasons and Five Phases will be disordered, and life and death will have no constancy.

**The Method of Suspending Images to Return the Spirit**
Within the body, the spirit is born: in spring, ten green youths; in summer, ten red youths; in autumn, ten white youths; in winter, ten black youths; and in the four seasons, twelve yellow youths. This is how the spirit is stored in men; the female spirit follows the same numbers. Men should visualize men, women should visualize women, all using a one-foot measure as the standard. Draw them well to make them pleasing, so that one loves them. If one cannot maintain joy and restraint, the hun and shen spirits will quickly return.

**The Secret of Resolving Karmic Inheritance**
Since the opening of heaven and earth, inauspicious qi has never ceased—once cut off, it later resurges. Why? Lifespan is heaven’s most precious treasure, privately bestowed by virtue and cannot be falsely obtained. To know this treasure, the myriad things within the six directions and eight reaches of heaven and earth must all be free from grievances and entirely joyful—only then can lifespan increase. If even one matter is displeasing, it may cause injury or death.

In human conduct, some strive to do good but instead encounter misfortune, while others strive to do evil but instead receive good. Those who claim to be virtuous when doing good but meeting misfortune are mistaken. Those who do good but meet misfortune bear the burden of their ancestors’ transgressions, as accumulated disasters flow forward and backward to harm them. Those who do evil but receive good inherit the deep accumulation of their ancestors’ great merits, which flow to them.

If one can perform great merits ten thousand times over, even if their ancestors had lingering misfortunes, they cannot reach this person. Instead, they pass on to future generations, forming a cycle of five generations. A small cycle completes in ten generations and returns to the beginning. Some may perform small good deeds but cannot overcome the disasters of their ancestors’ karmic inheritance, leading to the extinction of their lineage in later generations—truly a grievous injustice.

Karmic inheritance is divided into three realms by heaven: emperors inherit over thirty thousand years, ministers over three thousand years, and the people over three hundred years. All bear the inheritance in succession, rising and falling with the decline and prosperity of governance, never ceasing. If one can model this on the governance of the Heavenly Sovereign and cut it off, ponder deeply and never forget.

Humans have three lifespans corresponding to the three qi: the life of Great Yang, Great Yin, and Harmony. The upper lifespan is one hundred twenty years, corresponding to heaven and completing the great calendar of heaven and earth’s boundary. The middle lifespan is eighty years, corresponding to yin and yang, distinguishing the eight trigrams and aligning with earth, differentiating the myriad things—those who die depart, while those who live remain. The lower lifespan is sixty years, corresponding to the qi of Harmony, obtaining the hexagram *Dun* in the sixth month. *Dun* means escape and flight, thus governing the meeting of life and death.

If one ceaselessly does good, surpassing this lifespan is called transcending the world. If one ceaselessly does evil, failing to reach these three lifespans is called premature death. Those who die in the womb or before maturity bear the innocent burden of their ancestors’ transgressions. Those with frequent head ailments displease the qi of heaven.

Those with frequent foot ailments displease the qi of earth. Those with many internal illnesses suffer from the conflict of the Five Phases’ qi. Those with frequent limb ailments experience disharmony in the qi of the four seasons. Those with frequent deafness or blindness witness the Three Luminaries losing their proper measure. Those with frequent chills and fevers endure the contention of yin and yang qi. Those with frequent confusion and disorder see the myriad things losing their place. Those afflicted often by ghostly entities incur the wrath of heaven and earth’s spirits. Those who die of frequent warmth are slain by the qi of Great Yang. Those who die of frequent cold are harmed by the qi of Great Yin. Those who die suddenly suffer from the excessive haste of punitive qi. Those with frequent qi distension or shortness of breath experience the discord of the eight nodes. Now, heaven and earth’s yin and yang have entirely lost their proper places, thus harming the myriad things.

If the emperor’s governance is disharmonious, floods and droughts occur without regularity, bandits arise frequently, and yet punishments are made more severe, or their weight is increased, leading to endless entanglements. The people all cry out to heaven, while the officials’ governance is chaotic, losing proper measure and constancy. The myriad things are harmed, moving the Azure Heaven above, causing the Three Luminaries to rage and change, and the constellations to move erratically. Thus, only the supreme Dao can save them. I know the will of heaven does not deceive you. Once the might of heaven is unleashed, it cannot be restrained. To incur guilt before heaven is to invite premature death.

When heaven and earth first opened, the Great Sages each attained mastery in one aspect, knowing it with perfect sincerity and without doubt. Thus, each established a great enterprise for later generations to cultivate, without error. Therefore, even sages excel in but one great enterprise and cannot fully comprehend the Way of heaven, hence their virtues differ. This is like heaven and earth: how much more so for humans? Heaven and earth each excel in one aspect—heaven excels in height and clarity, earth in depth and turbidity, while the Harmonious Center nurtures the myriad things. Yet even they cannot encompass all, so how could ordinary people?

*Hai* marks the northwest extreme of heaven and earth, while *Si* marks the southeast extreme. If *Hai*’s cold does not withdraw in due time, the following *Si* will bring harm. *Zi* is the northern extreme of heaven and earth, and *Wu* the southern extreme. If *Zi*’s winter does not properly store and yield, *Wu* will bear the burden and perish. *Chou* is the northeast extreme of heaven and earth, and *Wei* the southwest extreme. If *Chou* does not timely bring forth life, the sixth month will instead bring its punishment. The nature and movement of heaven and earth are all like this.

Now, if the emperor rules within a hundred *li*, employing virtue and benevolence, his grace extends for ten thousand *li*, and the people receive his favor. Fathers are kind, children filial, households sufficient, and none turn to wickedness. If the emperor within loses his virtue, beyond ten thousand *li*, the people and ministers lose their proper roles. Though they are separated by countless miles, the cause is one. Practicing good words is not as effective as practicing good conduct oneself. [Title missing]

The Perfected One asked the Divine One: "In my life, what can I practice to always be joyful?"

The Divine One replied: "Do you yet observe the vast Perfected Ones of old? Those who age only after they have first flourished do so because they have abandoned the perverse. If one alone cherishes the true Dao, the true Dao is constantly preserved while the perverse dissipates. When all people are exhausted and impoverished, yet I alone endure forever—this is constant joy."

"Radiant and solitary in my delight, why should I resent anything? Yet if I ultimately cannot attain long life, what then?"

The Divine One said: "Accumulated practice nears completion; contemplating goodness nears life. The Dao is the scripture of the boundless. In highest antiquity, the Divine Ones governed by it, taking Perfected Ones as ministers to order the people. Thus, the people knew not that above them there was a Son of Heaven, and through the Dao’s natural non-action, they governed themselves. Next, the Perfected Ones governed, taking Immortals as ministers. The people did not perceive their ruler’s timely guidance, yet heard his teachings and revered their lord. Next, the Immortals governed, taking Daoists as ministers. Their rule was slightly marked by punishments and manifest laws, and the people’s hearts stirred with awe, giving rise to cunning and deceit. Next came hegemonic rule, where ministers were not carefully chosen. The people suffered many grievances, and disorder arose. As governance receded, chaos drew near, and it could no longer be controlled.

Thus, contemplating the divine invokes the divine; contemplating the true invokes the true; contemplating immortality invokes immortality; contemplating the Dao invokes the Dao; contemplating wisdom invokes wisdom. The essence of the sage’s thought summons the spirit of the worthy to come and aid him; contemplating the perverse summons the ghosts of fools to confuse him. Whatever one may contemplate can be invoked—it depends only on the excellence or inferiority of what is contemplated. Therefore, when a superior scholar becomes ruler, he contemplates the divine and true; when a middling scholar becomes ruler, his mind is penetrating and full of wisdom; when an inferior scholar becomes ruler, he cannot contemplate anything and merely follows fate as it unfolds." [Title missing]

The Perfected One asked, "How can one know whether a ruler’s thoughts are good or evil?"

The Divine One replied, "Is this not easily known? When a ruler contemplates benevolence and goodness, auspicious omens arise solely for him, and prophetic charts and texts manifest exclusively for him. A ruler’s benevolence and clarity emerge from Wood and Fire, martial wisdom from Metal and Water, and gentleness and harmony from Earth. Heaven’s descending signs never err."

The Perfected One asked, "In ancient times, extraordinary charts and rare methods spontaneously appeared—who was worthy to receive them?"

"Those among the officials and common people who obtained them presented them to the king. When a ruler’s *qi* aligns with the times and becomes harmonious and refined, governance grows ever more luminous. Daoist arts and worthy sages emerge to assist him, and the ruler’s Way daily waxes in strength. The barbarians are subdued and vanish; he governs with folded arms, punishments cease of themselves, and the people know no warfare. Is this not proof of a ruler’s good thoughts? Even without seeing the man, one already knows."

The Perfected One asked, "How does the Divine One come to know these things?"

The Divine One said, "Through the attainment of the soundless. When a ruler desires benevolence and cherishes life, he emulates the Way of Heaven; when ministers desire gentleness, compliance, and nurturance, they follow the Way of Earth—then auspicious responses arise. Thus, Heaven and Earth do not speak yet endure forever; their governance is uniquely divine. Divine immortals do not speak yet attain long life as immortals, for they inwardly illuminate while outwardly remain obscure—this is the origin of the myriad Ways.

"The divine and numinous come and go without fixed abode. In purity and stillness, without sound, resting peacefully upon the pillow, the radiance of spirit arises of itself—how could one not be blessed with joy? Those who speak excessively deplete their essence; those who labor excessively wear out their bodies; those who resort to force excessively harm themselves—from these arise misfortune and calamity. Heed my words and do not indulge in reckless thoughts. Good thoughts may bring virtue, but evil thoughts return to harm oneself. Between safety and peril, the difference is as fine as a hair’s breadth—beware of mixed thoughts.

"When a person loses the Dao, their fate is severed; by discerning the intent of the Dao, life may be preserved. Cultivate your essence diligently and do not consume yourself. Study under an enlightened teacher, and misfortune and chaos will not arise."

The Perfected One dared not disregard the Divine One’s words.

The Divine One said, "Scholars each act for their own sake, not for others. Therefore, each should cherish and attend to themselves. Through long accumulation in the study of the Dao, one becomes a divine immortal, utterly distinct from the multitude—such are these words."

The Perfected One asked, "How can one verify the efficacy of the Dao?"

The Divine One replied, "Resolve it through an enlightened teacher and practice it in oneself. When the body transforms and the form changes, one shares the same gate as the divine Way, becomes a neighbor to the true, and dwells in the same household as divine immortals. Seek it within yourself—why would you not see its benefits? If one loses the intent of the Dao, seeking it in the four directions will yield nothing, and one will reach old age in poverty. Thus severed from the root, one claims the world has no Dao, ever solitary and sorrowful—this is the greatest calamity.

"The great person, losing it, cannot govern in peace; the middling person, losing it, confuses their ruler; the benevolent person, losing it, has no means to act worthily; the petty person, losing it, destroys themselves. The conduct of the worthy sages of old is the same as today; the failures of the petty people of old are also the same as today—clear evidence is thus."

The Perfected One asked, "How can one know whether a person is about to rise or decline?"

The Divine One said, "When a great person is about to rise, extraordinary texts appear, and the worthy assist in governance. When a household is about to rise, those who seek find life, and the goodness of its descendants is assured."

The Perfected One asked, "How does one attract such worthy individuals?"

The Divine One replied, "All through thought—unceasing, concentrated thought brings all matters to fruition."

"Marvelous is the governance of the Dao! Can one not strive to practice it?"

The Divine One said, "The Three Bonds and Six Relations endure in good fortune because they uphold the Dao and do not lose their governance—thus they remain perpetually blessed. Heaven’s destined lifespan does not override human aspirations. The nature of Wood is benevolence; contemplating benevolence thus invokes the East, for the East governs benevolence. The five directions all follow this principle. The affairs of the world each follow their kind. Therefore, when a ruler contemplates tranquility, his governance is also tranquil—like summons like.

"The scholars of old verified it in themselves; the scholars of today verify it in others. The scholars of old sought to secure their own persons; the scholars of today pursue superficial embellishments. Instead of accumulating essence within themselves, they accumulate it in mere texts—this is to be ignorant of the root."

[Preserved] *The Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns*, Scroll One, "On Salvation and Guidance," citing *The Scripture of Great Peace*, Chapter Thirty-Three:

The Perfected One asked, "Why do people frequently fall ill?"

The Divine One answered, "When the spirit of the liver departs and does not return in due time, the eyes lose their brightness. When the spirit of the heart departs, the lips turn pale. When the spirit of the lungs departs, the nose becomes blocked. When the spirit of the kidneys departs, the ears grow deaf. When the spirit of the spleen departs, the mouth cannot taste sweetness. When the spirit of the head departs, one becomes dizzy and confused. When the spirit of the abdomen departs, the center of the belly becomes disordered and can digest nothing. When the spirits of the four limbs depart, one cannot move on their own.

"The nature of spirit and essence is to dwell in serene and quiet places, not in defiled and turbid ones. To recall the spirits, one must fast and purify oneself, hang their images in a fragrant chamber, and all illnesses will vanish. Without fasting and purification, the spirits will not return to the person. All these are reported to Heaven together. Thus, people’s illnesses accumulate, and the dead do not cease."

The *Taiping Jing* states, as the Perfected One said: "The human spirit and essence naturally dwell in serene and quiet places, not in defiled and turbid ones. To recall the essence, one must fast and purify oneself in a fragrant chamber, and all illnesses will vanish of themselves. Without fasting and purification, the spirit and essence will not return to the person. All these are reported to Heaven together, which is why people’s illnesses accumulate and the dead do not cease."

*The Taiping Imperial Digest*, Volume 667
*Comprehensive Collation of the Taiping Jing*, Volume 35, Part Bing I
*Taiping Jing*, Scroll 35, "Method for Distinguishing Poverty and Wealth," Chapter 41

The Perfected One asked, "You have followed me for some time to study the Dao. Have you truly mastered it all, or is there still more?"
The disciple replied, "Today, the Celestial Master no longer expounds further, deeming it sufficient. Yet upon hearing the Master’s words again, I realize there is still more I lack. My thoughts are now exhausted, and I do not know what else I should ask. I only hope the Celestial Master will further enlighten me on what I have yet to grasp."
The Perfected One said, "Come, Perfected One.
〈Rising〉 What in the world is called wealth, and what is called poverty?"
The disciple answered, "One who possesses much is wealthy; one who possesses little is poor."
The Perfected One said, "Your words are correct, yet in truth, they are not.
"What do you mean?"
"Now, if one has much that is false, deceitful, flattering, thieving, or treacherous, can this be called wealth? If the common people are many and the lord is few, can this be called poverty?"
〈End〉
The disciple said, "This foolish and ignorant one, seeing the Celestial Master’s instruction, dares not remain silent, though I fear my words may fall short and contain errors."
The Perfected One said, "You yourself admit your inadequacy—how could the vulgar know the true nature of poverty and wealth?"
The disciple replied, "Now, only by the Celestial Master’s guidance can this disciple, who is as ignorant as an infant, gain knowledge, just as a child must be taught by its parents before understanding."
The Perfected One said, "Excellent are your words. You are most modest, yet not mistaken."

"Very well. The Perfected One, in your refinement, will explain this to you in full.

〈Begin〉
What is meant by 'wealth' is complete and perfect sufficiency. Heaven, in its generation of all things, brings forth abundance—thus, when the qi of the Supreme Sovereign emerges, the full twelve thousand kinds of beings are produced, and this is called 'wealth and sufficiency.' When the beings of the Middle Sovereign are slightly diminished, unable to complete the twelve thousand, this is called 'lesser poverty.' When the beings of the Lower Sovereign are further reduced compared to the Middle Sovereign, this is called 'greater poverty.' When there are no auspicious responses and good beings do not arise, this is called 'the lowest extreme of poverty.'
〈End〉

If you wish to know its great effect, consider it like a farming household: lacking rare treasures or precious goods, it is a poor household. When the ten thousand beings cannot be fully provided for, it is the lowest, most extreme poor household—this is the poverty of Heaven and Earth.

〈Begin〉
When the twelve thousand beings all emerge and the Earth nourishes them without harm, this is the Earth’s wealth. When it fails to nourish them well, causing slight harm, this is the Earth’s lesser poverty. When the harm is great, it is the Earth’s greater poverty.
〈End〉
When good beings fear to appear, harmed by the Earth’s form and unable to arise, this is the lowest extreme of poverty. Lacking precious treasures and with half the ten thousand beings harmed, this is the great cause of poverty. When all are harmed, it is the destitute household of emptiness.

Thus,
〈Begin〉
Heaven is the father, Earth the mother—when these parents are in extreme poverty, their children grieve in poverty as well. This corresponds to the governance of kings.
〈End〉

Therefore, the sagely kings of antiquity, in their rule, were able to bring forth the twelve thousand beings—these were the supremely wealthy lords. When good beings fell short by two-thirds, they were lords of middle wealth. When they fell short by one-third, they were lords of lesser wealth. Lacking rare and excellent beings, they were lords of lower poverty. When half the ten thousand beings were harmed, they were declining houses. When all were harmed, they were the lowest poor people.

The sages and worthies of old dwelt deep in secluded chambers, reflecting on the Dao and virtue—
〈End〉
what need had they to inquire about poverty and wealth? They knew it all while seated in stillness."

"Excellent! Excellent! Now, only through the Celestial Master’s compassion for the long-suffering emperors and kings, who cannot act upon their intentions—how might they attain this wealth or poverty?"

"Excellent! Excellent! Your questioning has already entered the subtle and essential."

Thus, it is by the success or failure of their conduct that these outcomes arise.

Those who vigorously practice the true Dao are aided in their transformation by the celestial spirits born of Heaven, and so all fine and excellent things are fully provided. Those who practice virtue are assisted in their governance by the spirits of nourishment, born of Earth’s yang, and so they attain half-wealth. Those who practice benevolence are aided by the spirits of harmony and kindness, and so they attain lesser wealth. Those who practice civil arts open the path to deception, and so the spirits of deceit emerge to assist them, bringing minor disorder to their governance. Those who practice martial force are aided by the spirits of bandits and thieves, and so their rule runs counter to Heaven’s will, harming the good.

The Dao is what Heaven itself follows. Heaven is most spirit-like, and so the true spirits emerge to aid its transformation. Earth is nurturing, and so the spirits of virtue emerge to aid its transformation. Humanity is benevolent, and so the spirits of kindness emerge to aid its transformation. Civil arts, however, rely on elegant deception, losing their root and foundation—thus the spirits of deceit emerge to assist them. When superiors and inferiors engage in such deception, their affairs fall into chaos.

Martial rule employs punishment and killing to subdue the people, just as bandits and thieves use violence to overpower them. Those who govern through rage, pleasure, ferocity, or intimidation are no different from bandits. Thus, when bandits and thieves proliferate, governance turns inauspicious. Since bandits and thieves often inflict harm through wealth and goods, their rule loses control over resources.

Therefore, the rulers of old who subdued the people through the Dao won Heaven’s favor most fully. Their governance was as if divine, and they knew no sorrow, for they subdued the people through the true Dao. The middling rulers subdued the people through virtue; the lesser rulers through benevolence; the disorderly rulers through civil arts; and the doomed and failing rulers through punishment, killing, and harm.

Thus, the rulers of old subdued the people through Dao, virtue, and benevolence—not through civil arts, punishment, or killing. The reason for this is that such methods are base and vulgar. The noble ruler resembles Heaven and Earth: Heaven delights in giving life and does no harm, and so is called "lord" and "father." Earth delights in nourishing the myriad things, and so is called "loyal minister" and "mother." Humanity should employ a kind and loving heart, nurturing all as Heaven and Earth do, and so is called "benevolent." These three are good, and thus together they govern the myriad things, serving as their teachers and leaders.

Deception and punishment cannot bring order; they only invite misfortune day by day and cannot lead emperors and kings to Great Peace. Therefore, they must be abandoned.

Now, if a true person entrusts this text to a ruler of Dao and virtue, urging them to practice it with diligence so that its effects manifest and align with Heaven, they may attain Great Peace and be called a house of wealth—without doubt. They will spare emperors and kings from sorrow and prevent them from being called houses of poverty.

Yet today, when people in the world speak of "wealthy households," what do they mean? Such talk is merely the reckless chatter of the vulgar. For "wealth" means complete and perfect provision. If even one thing is lacking, it is not complete. Thus, the sages and worthies of old did not demand perfection from any single person, for they knew none could achieve it, and so they did not insist on such completeness.

Now, among the eighty-one domains and states, each lacks some things and cannot always be self-sufficient, so they must obtain them from other lands. How, then, can any single household be truly wealthy? Does the true person wish to follow the empty words of the common folk?

"‘I dare not, I dare not.’

‘Since you have studied the caution of speech, do not engage in reckless talk. For reckless talk disrupts the proper patterns of Heaven and Earth and cannot serve as a model for others. Be vigilant.’

‘Indeed, indeed. Now that the Heavenly Master has shown such kindness and compassion, taking pity on the emperors and kings who, though enthroned, labor with anxious hearts and fail to align with the Will of Heaven—would you, for their sake, fully expound the way to attain the Great Peace of the Supreme Sovereign? This humble student has received many texts, yet remains as bewildered as an unlearned child. What further should I ask? I only pray the Heavenly Master will set forth all the admonitions in full.’

‘Excellent, excellent! Now, the law of Heaven: the yang number is one, the yin number is two. Thus, yang is odd, yin is even. Therefore, rulers are few while ministers are many. Yang is noble, yin is base, so two yin must together serve one yang. Thus, the number of Heaven is one, and the number of Earth is two—hence, two women should serve one man. Why must two share the duty of nourishing one? The side of the noble must not be left vacant. When one acts, another should stand or sit beside them to attend to what is lacking. Thus, one symbolizes Heaven, and two symbolizes Earth. Humanity is the child of Heaven and Earth, and so must emulate its parents.

Since the world lost the Dao, it has come to scorn women, even murdering them, causing women to become fewer than men. Thus, the yin qi is severed, no longer corresponding to the laws of Heaven and Earth. The Way of Heaven decrees that a solitary yang cannot pair, leading to withering, and so Heaven does not send timely rain. Women correspond to Earth, yet they are despised alone. The world collectively scorns its true mother, collectively harms and slays the qi of Earth, causing the qi of Earth to be severed and cease its generative power. Earth grows furious and displeased, disasters multiply, and the king’s governance cannot achieve peace. Why is this? Men are the spirit of Heaven, women are the spirit of Earth. Things of the same kind move one another. The failure of governance to attain peace is not the fault of the king alone. It is the common people who, having lost the Dao, treat matters lightly and together commit wrongs. Their transgressions are not singular but manifold, making governance difficult, disorderly, and errant.

The nature of Heaven and Earth encompasses twelve thousand things, yet human life is the weightiest. This murder of daughters deeply disrupts the king’s governance—here lies the great calamity.’

‘Now that the Heavenly Master has opened the stairway to Great Peace for rulers, and the true scripture of Great Peace has emerged—should kings but wander freely without care—yet this harm to women brings about great disaster. What is to be done?’

‘Excellent is your question, for it aligns with the heart of Heaven. The reason the world scorns and despises women lies fundamentally in the faults of their conduct.’

‘What does this mean? I wish to hear it, to record it on bamboo and silk, that for ten thousand generations it may never be abandoned.’

‘Excellent that you would record this! If the world no longer kills daughters—’

‘Indeed, indeed. I wish to record it, to remove disaster from emperors and kings, which would bring me joy, and to save the lives of wronged women.’

‘Excellent! You have already gained the favor of Heaven’s reckoning.’

‘What does this mean?’"

"Yet to preserve life is called preserving one’s own life, while to take life is called destroying one’s own life. If you cherish children, you have already gained an increase in Heaven’s reckoning, and the Deity of Fate will amend your register."

"I dare not, I dare not."

"There is no further yielding—this is the natural law of Heaven. Now, the reason the world kills daughters is that when people are young and small, their parents fret and suffer, cutting off their clothing and food to share in their upbringing. This is not only so for humans—even creatures that crawl do the same. Yet when they grow old and large, each must seek clothing and food according to their own strength, so all things under Heaven eventually leave their parents to provide for themselves. The worthy find joy, while the unworthy find suffering. Moreover, children are young, their strength daily growing and in surplus, while parents daily age, their strength waning and insufficient. Whether son or daughter, the wise and strong in ability should still repay and requite their parents’ merit and kindness by supporting them. Thus, parents should not be responsible for providing their clothing and food. This is called nurturing the strong by the weak, supporting the surplus with the insufficient—it is called perverse governance. The young bring hardship to the old, offering no benefit to their parents, so parents often kill them. Now, if they are killed for lack of clothing and food, how is this better than raising them to provide for themselves?

Perfected One! This is truly a grievous severing of the earthly lineage—how profoundly foolish the people are!"

Now, when the youth hears this, their heart is filled with great sorrow and fear, knowing that those wronged are truly many—what is to be done?

Yes, those who love learning yet lack clothing and food will surely grow lax in their studies and halt their pursuit of the Dao. But if they obtain clothing and food, then the worthy will study without ceasing. Each should be allowed their own benefit, and none should be made to turn back and bring hardship upon one another.

What does this mean?

A woman has no official post; her marriage to a husband is like a man’s appointment to office—she should thereby obtain clothing and food. When a woman joins her husband’s household, they should unite their strength and hearts to manage their livelihood, together continuing the lineage of Heaven and Earth. Even unto death, their bones and flesh remain together, and they should join their strength to secure clothing and food. This will bring joy to the worthy and suffering to the unworthy.

It is like the land: fertile soil yields good crops, and Heaven bestows its favor upon it; barren soil yields poor crops, and Heaven likewise bestows its lot upon it. It does not seize what their strength and nature produce. If even Heaven and Earth do not deprive you of your labor, how much less should men? Thus, no one will kill their daughters again.

Excellent! Excellent! A great and deep harm is removed, and the Great Peace of the Emperor-King is at hand.

How does the Perfected One know this?

Parents and children share the deepest bond in the world; they should not be left in distress and sorrow, nor should they be killed. To kill one’s child is to invite the qi of bandits and thieves—it is a grave rebellion, utterly without the Dao. Thus, it deeply disrupts the governance of the Emperor-King. Now, if women are allowed to live without being murdered or harmed, great joy will come.

Yes, your words are correct—you may be said to understand this. Yet today, if every household in the world kills one daughter, how many hundreds of millions of households are there? Some families kill ten or more daughters; some even harm them before they are born. Their grievance and resentment rise to Heaven—how can this be without principle? Thus, I truly... deeply understand this.

If each person provides for themselves through their own labor, women will have no divided hearts, their minds will be single in their work, and they will no longer waver in doubt. But if they toil without reward, their hearts will remain discordant. This is the natural art of Heavenly nature. Perfected One, take heed: do not discard this text. Entrust it to a benevolent and worthy ruler, that it may remove this great grievance and disaster. Guard my words and show them to all people, so that none will dare kill their daughters again. This will accord with the laws of Heaven and Earth, and one man will have two women.

Thus, Heaven establishes its laws: the yang number is odd, the yin number is even. Since the Great Middle Antiquity, people have lost the intent of the Heavenly Dao, wantonly killing women, and so men have become numerous while women are few and insufficient. This greatly violates the Heavenly Dao, causing successive generations to bear its burden as a common custom. Later ages will suffer even greater evil and pain, utterly without the Dao.

Men inherit the lineage of Heaven; women inherit the lineage of Earth. Now, to sever the lineage of Earth, preventing it from continuing and transmitting life, will lead many to extinction without descendants—how grave their sin! All should mutually give life and transmit their kind. Now, to sever the lineage of Earth and destroy humanity is why Heaven, over time, will cut off their generations.

Moreover, all people are born containing the qi of Heaven, fully formed: the round head is Heaven; the square feet are Earth; the four limbs are the four seasons; the five viscera are the five phases; the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose are the seven luminaries and three lights. These cannot all be enumerated—only the sage knows them. All people possess both yin and yang; when the sun and moon are full, they emerge from the womb to see Heaven and Earth, and should grow to continue their ancestors’ lineage, assisting Heaven in generating beings and aiding Earth in nurturing forms.

Now, the gods of Heaven and Earth trust this household, so the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth comes to dwell in this person. Yet if people harm them, Heaven will greatly blame them. Since people do not restrain one another, Heaven has sent me to bring forth this text to show to later generations. If, after this matter has been revealed, one still persists in the old ways, it is called willfully violating the laws of Heaven. Their sin will be doubled, and their lineage will be extinguished without doubt.

Perfected One, take heed! Exert yourself, exert yourself!

Yes, yes.

Now that you have come to understand this matter, if you flee and hide this text, you will bear the punishment in place of others.

I dare not, I dare not.

Go now, and each look to your own well-being.

"Yes, yes."

The above section, "Arising," distinguishes the practices for the poor, the rich, and rulers—how to establish auspiciousness and prohibit the severing of Earth's lineage to restore balance between men and women and rectify royal governance. "Ceasing."

**Method of One Man and Two Women, Forty-Second**

Perfected One, step forward.

Now, as the great qi of peace and harmony is arriving, royal governance approaches great peace. Should people uphold chastity or not? And why should they uphold it?

"Chastity means restraining emotions and desires, refraining from reckless conduct."

Ah, Perfected One, your words are pure. Since the Great Middle Antiquity, the error of common people lies in their teachers' inner jealousy, which instead teaches them reckless conduct.

The Perfected One said: "What do you mean?"

"Arising: The chaste man does not emit, and the chaste woman does not transform. When yin and yang do not unite, their lineage is cut off and extinguished without descendants. Two people together sever the lineage of Heaven and Earth, coveting a petty, hollow reputation while forfeiting their posterity and losing their true essence. This is the greatest harm under Heaven. Ceasing.

Had your parents not transmitted life to you, how would you exist? Yet you sever it—this is what Heaven and Earth jointly detest, called those who cut off principle and commit great treason. The consequence is that Heaven and Earth become estranged: Heaven refuses to send rain, and Earth refuses to transform and generate. Why is this?

Arising: When Heaven does not rain, it is because the chaste man does not emit. When Earth does not generate the myriad things, it is because the chaste woman does not transform. If Heaven does not rain and Earth produces nothing, this is the greatest misfortune under Heaven. Ceasing.

How can this be considered good?"

"Perfected One, your words defy the teachings of Heaven and Earth, reverse the Dao of Heaven, and refuse to joyfully assist Heaven and Earth in generating and transforming. Instead, you seek to sever them. Do your spoken words not betray the August Heaven and Revered Earth?"

"Though not yet mature, I have faults. Having heard the Celestial Master's teaching, do I not now recognize the gravity of my transgression?"

"Let me tell you: nothing should contravene the Dao of Heaven. Yet by following the words of common people and defying the will of Heaven, the frequent estrangement of yin and yang stems from the disharmony between men and women. Men and women are the root of yin and yang. If governance loses its root, how can it be auspicious?"

"Now, Celestial Master, what should be done?"

"Indeed, when the Supreme August Heaven’s balanced qi descends, one must purely follow the Dao of Heaven. Thus, let one man be matched with two women, to mirror yin and yang. The yang number is odd, the yin number even—this is the arrival of the Great Harmony’s qi. If women are too numerous, yin qi flourishes; if men are too numerous, yang qi becomes unpaired and disordered, also inviting misfortune. Why? The count of humans must correspond with Heaven and Earth; if it fails to correspond, strength will be insufficient, and calamity will follow."

"Now, the imperial harem of the Son of Heaven corresponds to the earth—what does this mean?"

"Perfected One, your words now aid my own. Women are the spirit of the earth; the king is the spirit of Heaven. If the earth does not receive the spirit of yang, the king’s qi will not harmonize. Should the earth fail to generate life, each province must offer one woman to circulate its qi. Those who delight in transformation fear that grace may not extend fully, that the king’s bestowal may not be complete—thus they correspond to the earth and take them. When grace is universally bestowed, Heaven’s qi flows freely, timely rains fall, and the earth generates the myriad things. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, one must not esteem chastity excessively. To do so inwardly is a grave transgression, causing the king’s governance to lose harmony. Likewise, common people must not exceed proper measure—hence one man with two women."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

〈Inception〉
Aligning with Heaven and Earth, conforming to yin and yang, ensuring no grievance between men and women—this brings timely rains, enables the earth to transform and generate life, and harmonizes the king’s governance.

〈Cessation〉

**Method for Promoting Good and Suppressing Evil, Forty-Third**

Before the Perfected One:
"Now that the qi of Great Peace has arrived, we wish to ensure that the conscientious and good flourish day by day, while the wicked steadily decline. Yet there are those who harm and kill, bandits and thieves who arise—how should governance address this?"

"What do you mean?"

"When such matters arise, what is known must be acted upon. If the lord of men sits in doubt, wishing the good to flourish greatly and the wicked to swiftly decline—when bandits and thieves arise, they must be apprehended at once."

"How, then, should governance proceed?"

"Now, Perfected One, you should take careful note."

"Today, the Heavenly Master commands it—I dare not refuse. Yet with every word, I fear I may fall short of the Heavenly Master’s standards."

"Why such modesty in speech? Since ancient times, even the greatest sages have not demanded perfection from a single person. If your words today miss the mark, why be modest?"

"Very well, very well. One must simply reward the good and punish the evil, making the distinctions clear and unmistakable—then the good will flourish daily, and the wicked will decline."

"Your words are correct. But do rewards and punishments lack names?"

"Unworthy as I am, I cannot summarize it in a single phrase—I dare not elaborate further. Now, may the Heavenly Master graciously expound in full."

"So be it. Take heed, for I shall explain it to you in detail."

When the chief magistrate arrives at the designated place, he summons all the people of his jurisdiction. Former high officials and old retainers are seated facing east; those learned in the classics and men of Dao and virtue are seated facing north; the filial and fraternal are seated facing west; diligent tenant farmers and dutiful sons are placed in the southeast corner facing northwest; wicked youths are placed in the southwest corner facing northeast. The lord himself sits facing south. Why must they be seated precisely thus? Each is grouped according to their kind—this is the Way of Heaven, which accords with human nature to establish goodness.

Why are thieves and bandits easily apprehended? Former high officials and old retainers are placed where loyalty gathers; these men, though no longer in office, delight in aiding with righteousness. Those learned in the classics and men of Dao and virtue are placed where clarity gathers, so they may illuminate the classics and the Way to assist in discerning evil. The filial and fraternal are placed in their native villages, for the utmost filial piety lies in devotion of the heart—thus they are returned to their native villages. The filial and fraternal are to remain ever reverent, as if attending court. All things are born in the east, delighting in daily progress. The diligent and hardworking sons are placed in the southeast corner, for the southeast is the direction of growth and nurturance, that they may delight in cultivating the myriad things without slackening. Wicked youths are placed in the southwest, for the southwest is where yang wanes and yin arises—the abode of cunning and mischief, where punishments and crimes originate. Hence, apes and monkeys, creatures of dexterous trickery, are placed in this declining direction. Those facing east, west, and north are all seated in the front, while the negligent and wicked youths are placed behind.

If there is wine, each is granted a vessel; if there is none, those of good words are rewarded. Thus they are made to assist one another in wisdom. The lord sits in the central space, enclosed within the chamber. One by one, they are called forth—this assembly of people begins with instruction by rank. Each speaks once, and each records the name of their superior. What is spoken and recorded must later correspond; those whose words do not correspond are punished. Those whose words do not align are great flatterers and deceivers, and their deceit will later be exposed. Those whose words align are rewarded only after a long time, and their rank is advanced—not immediately. Why? To avoid provoking resentment. For a lord and father to cause his ministers and children to resent him is not the way of a benevolent father or worthy ruler.

Once the assembly is concluded, all good people are sent away. The wicked youths and officials who fail to capture the thieves are not permitted to remain. If the Perfected One employs this text and entrusts it to a lord of supreme virtue, showing it to all people so each knows of this teaching, then the good will flourish daily, the wicked will decline, and thieves, bandits, and treacherous villains will be apprehended.

"Excellent, excellent! Why must it be shown in advance?"
"When Heaven is about to bring rain, wind and clouds must first appear to inform people. The reason is to delight in their preparation and storage. Thus, showing it in advance delights in the daily flourishing of the good and the daily cessation of the wicked. Now, as the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, I fear people may do evil and disrupt its governance—hence, I awaken them beforehand. Governing should emulate Heaven."

"Excellent, excellent! Why must the lord necessarily enclose himself within the chamber while those who speak remain outside?"
"Indeed, when one is about to hear confidential words, the mind must not be aware of what lies ahead. If faces are too close, bystanders will know, and those who speak may come to harm. For a lord to receive wisdom from others and later allow them to be harmed is called injuring the loyal and trustworthy, the worthy and capable pillars of state—after which, none will dare speak again. With wisdom cut off, governance will fall into chaos and peril.

Moreover, the lord is yang and dwells in yin; ministers are yin and dwell in yang. When yin and yang harmonize, people delight in what is said, and all proposals are fully trusted—this is the natural law of Heaven. Does the Perfected One now understand?"
"Yes, yes."

"Go now, and speak not recklessly. This is the scripture that brings Great Peace."
"Yes, yes."

[Here ends the section on "Encouraging Goodness, Suppressing Evil, Cultivating Wisdom, and Establishing Those Who Attain the Method of Loyalty and Trustworthiness."]

*Tai Ping Jing: Collated and Annotated Edition, Scroll 36, Bing Section Part Two*
*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll 36*
*Guarding the Three Realities, Chapter 44*

The Perfected One spoke: "Come forward."
"Yes, yes."
"Of all the actions of the common people in the world, which are most urgent? Which are of lesser urgency? And which, though they daily increase misfortune and calamity, are deemed not urgent? You must speak with utmost precision."
"Yes, yes. I shall speak only what my heart knows, concealing nothing."
"Proceed."
"In all matters under Heaven, what is used is urgent; what is unused is not urgent."
"Your words are correct—yet not entirely so. What is truly and constantly urgent, and cannot be abandoned, is that which, if abandoned, would leave the world barren and devoid of people. The celestial patterns, when aligned, bear no name—yet these are of the greatest urgency. What you have spoken of concerns only what momentarily aligns with human desires, yet in truth fosters the conditions from which misfortune and calamity arise."
"Perfected One, what I now ask of you is this: which are the constant urgencies that cannot be set aside?"
"Now, let the Celestial Master expound and distinguish them clearly for you. I, dull and overreaching, dare not speak amiss even once, lest I not dare speak again."
"Indeed, your words are correct. One may speak only of what one knows; to speak of what one does not know is to invite one’s own ruin."
"Matters beyond human comprehension, whether great or small, cannot be forced. What is within reach presents no difficulty; what lies beyond cannot be made easy. Therefore, since the Celestial Master has already begun to instruct one so dim and unenlightened as I, I humbly beg you to open the way and reveal its beginning, that I may listen with full assent."

The Perfected One spoke: "Under Heaven, there are two great urgencies and one lesser urgency. All else is not urgent—in fact, it wearies the ears and eyes of people, appearing good for the moment yet fostering long-term harm, summoning calamity upon them. All people thus meet with ruin and defeat. What does this mean?"
"Foolish though I am, I understand: when people first receive life and destiny, they partake of Heaven and Earth, embracing primordial qi in spontaneity. They neither drink nor eat, but live by inhaling and exhaling the qi of yin and yang. They know no hunger or thirst. Over time, they drift far from the divine Way, slightly losing their original intent. Later generations no longer comprehend this, and the true Dao becomes hollow. Day by day, they drift toward falsity, growing hungry and thirsty. Without drink or food, they die—this is the first great urgency. Heaven and Earth, in their compassion, provide sustenance for life. Once people drink and eat, the celestial mandate of yin and yang must be transmitted without interruption. This transmission should mirror Heaven and Earth, alternating between yin and yang. Thus, Heaven ensures there is one man and one woman, their forms harmonious, so that they may give birth. Why must it be one yin and one yang? When yang reaches its extreme, it generates yin; when yin reaches its extreme, it generates yang. These two alternate, like cold giving way to heat, and heat to cold—this is the natural art. Thus, they perpetuate life endlessly, preserving the celestial mandate through the ages. If men and women do not unite, there will be no descendants. Without people in the world, how can there be husbands and wives, fathers and children, rulers and ministers, masters and disciples?

Without the union of male and female, how can the mandate of Heaven and Earth be transmitted? Silence would reign, and all would be void—this is the second great urgency. Thus, yin and yang transmit the mandate of Heaven and Earth, ensuring it knows no end. Rulers and ministers govern disorder; sages and masters of disciples propagate the teachings of Heaven, assisting the emperor in transforming the world. Therefore, sustenance and the union of men and women are interdependent—these two are the great urgencies.

The Dao of Heaven has cold and heat, which do not conceal themselves; when unbalanced, they harm and kill people. Thus, Heaven generates the myriad things, which may be clothed..."

Without clothing, one could only dwell in caves and live in concealment—yet even then, half would perish from suffering, and death would not be wholly averted. This is called a *half-urgency*. What is meant by the *great urgency* of the Dao of Heaven is none other than extinction and annihilation—nothing is more urgent than this.

If people lack clothing, they cannot properly partake of food and drink or unite in yin and yang, nor can they cultivate goodness. With clothing, the worthy are born; without it, the unworthy arise. Thus, clothing serves only to ward off harm. For this reason, the sages of antiquity did not adorn themselves in black and yellow.

Food and drink, yin and yang, must not be severed. To sever them is to leave the world without people, rendering it ungovernable. By upholding these three, one may fulfill one’s allotted years, transmit the mandate of Heaven, and ensure that the end returns to the beginning in an unending cycle.

Thus, the sages of old governed by these three, casting aside all else that was not urgent and only summoned misfortune. Why is this so? These three accord with the movements of Heaven. The male is Heaven; the female is Earth; clothing is dependence. Heaven and Earth, father and mother, are what people depend upon to nourish their forms and bodies. Beyond these three, all other strange and artificial things are unnecessary for life and the transmission of generations. Instead, they breed falsity and deceit, disrupting governance, obstructing the imperial qi from reaching its fullness, and causing the Dao of Heaven to go awry. This is a grave concern for the noble person.

The six emotions that people delight in—each indulges in them without restraint, growing ever more enamored, thereby inviting calamity. The noble person loses control of governance, while petty men resort to theft, plunder, and assassination—all summoned by these non-urgent things. The world falls into poverty, distress, and suffering; disasters arise in succession; inferiors deceive their superiors—all due to this great harm.

This has been the case for a long time, and it is not solely the fault of people today or those of later generations. The error has been passed down through generations, each bearing the burden and losing the original truth. They all pursue superficial splendor, only to bring sorrow and harm upon themselves, failing to fulfill their allotted years.

Later generations engage in endless affairs, all because they treat non-urgent matters as urgent, thereby inviting misfortune. Thus, they are constantly rushing about without respite. Day by day, they drift toward superficiality, and in doing so, they invite sorrow and suffering, failing to fulfill their allotted years. They compel later generations to rush about without cease, draining the mountains and rivers, severing the primordial qi, weakening the qi of the Earth, and preventing the nurturing of the myriad things. Heavenly disasters and transformations follow, the people gradually dwindle, and deceit and falsity arise once more.

Such is the harm wrought by non-urgent things. Yet people seek only to please their eyes and ears, unaware of the profound and vast harm they bring. In high antiquity, governance was achieved through non-action because the Dao was understood and the will of Heaven was grasped—by holding fast to the root and not losing the three urgencies. In middle antiquity, affairs multiplied slightly because people became somewhat more elaborate. In later antiquity, great worries arose because people became excessively elaborate, giving rise to deceit and falsity. They competed to outdo one another, bringing sorrow upon themselves, and from this, deceit and villainy emerged.

Having lost their true essence and severed their root, they turned to harming one another, causing people to become bewildered and confused. Though the noble person grieves in their heart and wishes to correct this, the countless affairs they undertake only serve to further disrupt governance.

The Perfected One deeply contemplates this truth.

"Excellent! Excellent!"

The right way is to uphold the Three Realities, pacify qi, dispel deceit and falsity, and eliminate cunning and treachery. The Three Urgencies and the Laws of Fortune and Misfortune, Chapter Forty-Five.

The Perfected One asked, "Among the crawling creatures before me, how many have great urgencies? How many have small urgencies? And how many have no urgency at all?"

"Indeed, each has its own urgencies—thousands of strands, ten thousand threads—all designated by what kind of urgency they are. Crawling creatures each have their own aspirations, yet they cannot be named."

The Perfected One sighed, "You have grown weary and confused. Why do you feign ignorance so persistently?"

"In truth, I do not grasp it fully."

"If even you say you do not grasp it, how much less can the common people, who have lost their way? Their failure to grasp it is certain."

"Only the Heavenly Master, in your compassion, might resolve this ignorance for me."

"Very well! All crawling creatures receive the governance of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and come into being. They all share two great urgencies and one small urgency—what do these mean? When crawling creatures first receive the governance of yin and yang, they all breathe in unison, containing the qi of spontaneity, yet they do not yet know food and drink. Over time, they drift far from their root. As the Great Dao wanes and Heaven’s qi can no longer constantly follow and protect them, hunger and thirst arise. Heaven generates food and drink, which are also transmitted through the governance of yin and yang. Thus, there are male and female, and generation after generation, they propagate without end. To sever their food and drink, to cut off the transmission of yin and yang—this would leave the world without crawling creatures. These are the two great urgencies.

The one small urgency is this: creatures with fur, feathers, or scales may live, and even insects may survive. Yet those with fur or feathers are constantly good and lovable, shielding them from cold and heat. Those with scales constantly ward off harm. These are not essential for survival, and so they are called the small urgency. All other movements are sources of misfortune. If one does not uphold these three roots but acts recklessly without cause, one will surely perish. This is the natural law suspended between Heaven and Earth.

Perfected One, you should ponder this meaning. Those who uphold these three ways will harmonize with the central harmony of Heaven and Earth. Those who lose these three and multiply their affairs will all suffer misfortune and harm."

"Excellent! Excellent! Since the Heavenly Master has expounded this, I humbly beg to ask one more question."

""

"To proceed in balance."

"Now, for those like creeping roots and drooping branches—those that neither eat nor drink nor wear clothing—what is to be done?"

"Alas! Your learning does not advance day by day but instead regresses into ignorance. Why is this?"

"Is there also a great urgency and a small urgency for them? What are they?"

"Listen clearly."

"Yes, yes."

"All things require rain to live—this is their food and drink. They must have day and night, one scorching and one shaded: by day, the yang qi brings warmth; by night, the yin qi brings moisture. Only then can they grow and abide in their place. This is their union of yin and yang. Their drooping branches and spreading leaves are their clothing. Whether they have many leaves or few, they still live—this is their substance and adornment.

Thus, without timely rain, the myriad things under Heaven would not grow. If not a single thing existed under Heaven, it would be a great calamity—this is the first great urgency. Without day and night to harmonize the qi of yin and yang, things would have no means to mature. If nothing under Heaven bore fruit, it would be a great calamity—this is the second great urgency. Whether a plant has sparse leaves or many, it still bears fruit; both may fruit, and it need not be a set number of leaves—this is the small urgency. The fruit is its kernel.

Therefore, the sages of old upheld these three kernels, governing to bring about Great Peace. They attained the heart of Heaven and enjoyed long fortune, fulfilling their natural span. Substance alone sufficed; there was no need for elaborate adornments of many hues.

Thus, those lost in the branches should return to the center; those lost in the center should return to the root; those lost in adornment should return to substance; those lost in substance should return to the root. The root shares its origin with Heaven and Earth—hence, it governs.

Those bewildered in the later ages should reflect on the middle ages; those confused in the middle ages should reflect on the high antiquity; those disordered in high antiquity should reflect on the celestial patterns of Heaven and Earth; those who doubt the celestial patterns should reflect on the forms of the natural; those perplexed by the natural should reflect on the primordial numinous qi.

Thus, the sages and worthies of old who ‘ate qi’ and governed dwelled in secluded chambers to contemplate the Dao, pondering the images of gain and loss, never daring to transgress the bounds of Heaven’s law. Abiding in purity and stillness, they grasped its meaning, and their governance swiftly brought peace, resembling Heaven and Earth!

Perfected One, deeply ponder my words of the Dao—do you comprehend them?"

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Go now, for you have awakened. If you model your governance on my writings, you may test it and see results in no time.

Do not conceal this text, so that all people may recognize where they have lost substance or adornment. Let them deeply reflect on its meaning and return to the three truths. Do not bring sorrow upon yourselves through falsehood and deceit. Perfected One, be vigilant!"

"Yes, yes."

The right explanation: all things preserve their root, gaining the three urgencies brings fortune, losing the three urgencies brings harm.

**Chapter Forty-Six: Serving the Dead Must Not Exceed the Law of the Living**

The Perfected One stepped forward.
"Yes, yes."
"When a filial child serves their parents, after the parents’ passing, should they serve them as they did in life?"
"No. They should serve them even more than in life."
"Why?"
"People are born through their parents and grow to greatness. When they see their parents die, with no hope of return, their hearts cannot forget them for even a moment. In life, they saw them daily, received their teachings and commands, and could repay them in going out and coming in. But in death, they can no longer behold them, and their longing grows ever more sorrowful—thus, they should serve them even more than in life."
"The Perfected One speaks rightly, yet this is already a great departure from the true Dao of Heaven, growing ever more distant. If even the Perfected One speaks thus, how much more do the benighted common people err, clearly transgressing Heaven’s law!"
"What do you mean, Heavenly Master?"
"Indeed, in life, humans resemble Heaven and belong to Heaven. In death, they resemble Earth and belong to Earth. Heaven is the father; Earth is the mother—one must not serve the mother more than the father. The living are yang; the dead are yin—one must not serve yin more than yang. Yang is the ruler; yin is the subject—one must not serve the subject more than the ruler. To serve yin in excess of yang is to invite rebellious qi. A slight excess brings minor rebellion; a great excess brings great rebellion—this is called rebellious qi, called perverse governance. Its harm allows yin qi to overpower yang, the lower to deceive the upper, and malevolent ghosts and spirits to rise in great numbers, overwhelming the human Dao and moving about in daylight without fear of people. This is why illness does not cease, and wandering ghosts do not desist. The great fault lies here—do you understand, do you comprehend?"
"This foolish one was greatly ignorant and in error. Now, having heard the Heavenly Master’s words, I am suddenly awakened with deep sorrow. I pray the Master will forgive my diligence and caution in service, and enlighten me where I have failed to grasp. How could such a small and subtle transgression lead to this?"
"To serve yin in excess of yang, the lower in excess of the upper—this is the greatest of transgressions. How can you call it small? The Perfected One still does not fully grasp. Moreover, the living are yang; ghosts and spirits are yin. The living belong to day; the dead belong to night. Do you wish to know the profound consequences of this? If day grows long and flourishes, night becomes short; if night grows long, day becomes short. When yang flourishes, it overpowers yin, and yin hides, not daring to appear recklessly—thus, ghosts and spirits conceal themselves. When yin flourishes, it overpowers yang, and yang hides—thus, ghosts and spirits appear in daylight. The living accompany the sun; malevolent ghosts and spirits accompany the stars. The sun is yang; the stars are yin. Therefore, when the sun appears, the stars flee; when the stars appear, the sun sets. When yin prevails, ghosts and spirits together cause harm so profound it cannot be named—this is called the flourishing of yin and the decline of yang. It causes governance to fail and harms the living. This transgression is most grave—ponder it deeply."
"Yes, yes."

[Appendix] The Perfected One further asked the Divine Person: "When a filial son serves his parents, after their passing he continues to serve them—should this be equal to when they were alive? Or is there a difference? Some serve them even more than when they were alive, while others serve them less. A person is born of their parents, grows to adulthood, and when they see their parents depart with no hope of return, unable to receive their teachings or repay their kindness in daily life, their thoughts and longings cannot cease. To serve them more than when they were alive—is this permissible?"

The Divine Person replied: "Your words reflect only the filial piety of the common world, not the intent of the Great Dao. A person’s life resembles Heaven and belongs to Heaven; a person’s death resembles Earth and belongs to Earth. Heaven is the father; Earth is the mother. One cannot serve the mother more than the father. Life is yang; death is yin. One cannot serve yin more than yang. Yang is the Way of the ruler; yin is the Way of the minister. One cannot serve a minister more than one’s ruler. To serve yin more than yang is to cause the qi of yin and yang to rebel, giving rise to disaster. To serve the lesser more than the greater is to cause governance to rebel, bringing great misfortune. When yin qi overpowers yang, the lower deceives the upper, and malevolent ghosts and spirits flourish, appearing in daylight along the human path. Epidemics never cease, and yang qi is obstructed. The Way of the ruler declines while the Way of the minister grows strong.

Thus, the enlightened emperors and kings of antiquity exalted yang as their utmost priority and humbled yin as their duty. The day is yang; the night is yin. When the day grows long, the night becomes short; when the night grows long, the day becomes short. When the day flourishes, the living flourish; when the night flourishes, ghosts and spirits flourish. The living accompany the sun; ghosts accompany the stars. The sun is yang; the stars are yin. Therefore, when the sun appears, the stars flee; when the stars appear, the sun sets. When yin prevails, ghosts and spirits cause harm—this is the harm brought by yin.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven establishes the law: the duty of yin must always be weaker than yang. Just as a minister must be weaker than their ruler, only then can the minister serve the ruler with obedience; a child must be weaker than their parents, only then can the child serve their parents with filial piety. If they grow strong and unyielding, the harm will be profound and severe. Therefore, though a filial son’s love and affection for their parents cannot be forgotten, they must not serve them more than when they were alive. Does the Perfected One not understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"Be cautious! Be most cautious! In all matters, one must not indulge in reckless actions."

"Yes, yes."

"If one serves the dead more than they served the living, this exceeds the bounds of Heaven—how can this be?"

"This is to show disrespect to yang while revering yin, to turn one’s back on what is above and face what is below, thus transgressing the Way of Heaven. This foolish student bears great fault—may the Heavenly Master forgive me!"

"Not so. Simply reflect carefully: all actions must accord with the law."

"Yes, yes. The Heavenly Master has enlightened me; I wish to fully understand why one must not exceed what was done in life. In burial rites, clothing, grave goods, and mourning practices, nothing should surpass what was done while alive. All such excess is perverse governance, and even the dead may incur punishment for it. To send off the dead in a manner not recorded in the underworld’s ledgers, to be questioned for falsehoods—this is deceitful conduct, and the punishment will be even more severe. To honor the dead with excessive mourning rites instead brings misfortune: malevolent spirits arise, plagues spread, strange calamities multiply. How can this be explained?"

"Excellent question! From ancient times, the sages conducted funerals with utmost sincerity alone, never daring to overdo them. Death is the most inauspicious of all affairs. To amplify inauspicious matters invites harm, so sincerity alone suffices. Food and drink should resemble what was offered in life, without excess. Thus, people of that era enjoyed good fortune and health, living out their natural years.

In the middle antiquity, funeral rites slightly deviated from the law, though sincerity remained the core. Yet, losing sight of its true intent, people began to show superficial reverence, drifting into extravagance to appease the living. Their hearts only half-reached the dead, so the dead’s spirits only half-returned to partake. With mourning rites slightly at odds with truth, sacrifices summoned spirits—yet no one knew which ghosts or deities came to consume the offerings. They lingered to afflict the living, causing minor illnesses.

In later antiquity, people inherited the minor faults of the middle era and amplified them into grave errors. They no longer acted with sincerity toward the dead but sought to overwhelm the living with displays of mourning, emulating the ancients’ glory while violating the law. Their conduct became false, failing to move Heaven or summon the dead. The spirits no longer came regularly to partake, so people expanded sacrifices beyond all bounds, strengthening yin to the detriment of yang. Countless unknown spirits gathered to feast, then ran amok, wreaking havoc and killing without end. Seeing such excess go unpunished, why would they not indulge in it?

Thus, evil qi multiplied daily, turning to attack its hosts. Accustomed to feeding on the living, it followed them relentlessly. With yin overpowering yang, the living were oppressed; ministers deceived their rulers, children deceived their parents. Governance became unjust, yet the people remained unaware. Evil grew ever more severe, no longer restrained. Therefore, the sages and worthies of old never dared to serve the dead more than the living—this was their clear prohibition. Does the Perfected One now understand?"

"How profound! How profound! Had the Heavenly Master not revealed this, this foolish student would never have known it."

"Perfected One, you and I share the same heart—Heaven must have sent you to preside over these questions. Do not take this lightly. This is why I have told you everything. The reason is this: the era of balanced qi is about to arrive. All matters must follow the natural order; a single act of reversal will prevent its arrival. What does this mean? The Dao of Heaven calls for strengthening yang and weakening yin to achieve harmony. To instead strengthen yin and suppress yang is to act against the Way. To honor the dead with excessive rites invites inauspicious qi, causing governance to falter and order to collapse—this is no minor transgression.

In high antiquity, people managed funerals with sincerity alone, sending off the dead no more grandly than in life. Human hearts were pure and simple, illness was rare. In middle antiquity, rites gradually lost their proper measure, drifting into extravagance. Resources were exhausted on funeral goods, sacrifices grew lavish, and ghosts and spirits multiplied. The people suffered plagues, and malevolent spirits ran rampant, unstoppable. In later antiquity, sacrifices to other spirits flourished, yin was exalted, ghosts and deities were served to the harm of the living. Ministers usurped their rulers’ authority, women dominated households, warfare erupted violently, treachery and factions arose, flattery spread, governance decayed, and the ruler’s Way was obstructed. All this stemmed from exalting yin over yang, which the Dao of Heaven detests, bringing these disasters. Can one not be cautious?

Perfected One, do not conceal this text. Share it so that all may know the difference between gain and loss. When governance is disordered, the fault does not lie with Heaven, Earth, or the ruler alone. The blame rests with the people, each bearing their own transgressions, mutually compounding them, multiplying their errors. All this arises from abandoning truth.

What does this mean? Life is the root; death is the false. Why is death called false? The dead cannot be seen or desired, yet the living fabricate things for them, vainly adorning their likenesses beyond what they had in life. They cling to emptiness, not to truth. When a person dies, their hun-soul returns to Heaven, their bones and flesh decay into the earth. How can one, without thought, summon their spirit to partake of offerings? Their bones and flesh no longer remain, entrusted to the earth. The earth is humanity’s true mother. Born between Heaven and Earth, one’s essence differs from life—do they know their proper duty? Thus, the filial child serves the dead according to the root, and only then do they act with truth.

What the living do not enjoy should not be given to the dead. One must not exceed what was done in life, or strange calamities will run deep."

"Enlightened One, do you understand? Be cautious, be most cautious."
"Yes, yes! Excellent, excellent! The truth has indeed emerged!"
"You may be said to have grasped it. Go now."
"Yes, yes."

*Right: Matters of life from beginning to end must correspond with the essential teachings.*

**Tai Ping Jing Combined Collation, Bing Section, Part Three**
**Tai Ping Jing, Scroll Thirty-Seven**
**Test of the Writ: The Great Faith Method, Forty-Seventh**

The Great Foolish and Ignorant One prostrates twice and says: "Now I have further doubts and humbly ask the Heavenly Master, the Supreme August Divine Person."
"What matter do you inquire about?"
"I beg to ask: In this written text, what is its general essential purpose? For what duty was it revealed?"
"Excellent, excellent! Your question may be said to have attained the heart of August Heaven. This is the great essential explanation of its purpose.

*It begins:* Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, emperors, kings, and the people have borne the burden of mutual responsibility—this is why it was revealed."
*It ends:* "Now that it has been revealed for this purpose, why does it instead first speak of nurturing one’s nature?"
"Ah! Enlightened One, you are truly ignorant, truly benighted, and fail to comprehend. Earlier, when I heard your words, I took them as humble deference—why have you now truly fallen into darkness and confusion?"
"Very well."

"Enlightened One, lend your ears and listen clearly.

*It begins:* Now, the reason all people incur blame and responsibility is that they fail to properly nurture themselves, entirely losing their fundamental principles—thus they bear the burden of mutual responsibility. For example, if parents lack the utmost virtue and power and commit offenses against their neighbors, their descendants may later suffer harm at the hands of those same neighbors—this is a clear instance of bearing mutual responsibility. When former kings governed, if they did not align with the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth, they were not alone in disrupting the harmony of Heaven. Heaven grew greatly enraged and displeased, bringing forth myriad afflictions and disasters. Those who later held office then inherited this burden—how could this not be thoroughly examined?

Thus, this text was revealed precisely for this purpose. Therefore, the great worthies of antiquity all knew the Dao of self-nurturance, and so their governance accorded with the Way, resulting in few failures of mutual responsibility. However, the teachers of later generations often concealed or discarded the essential texts of the true essential Dao, transmitting only superficial and ornate learning, thereby deviating from the essential intent of the Heavenly Dao. This caused later generations to grow increasingly shallow, unable to properly nurture and cherish themselves. Over time, this accumulated, and they drifted ever farther from the Dao, claiming there was no method to preserve safety in the world. They then grew careless in their affairs, contended for rank and emolument, and thus brought about the disasters of mutual responsibility.

*It ends:* Do you now comprehend this intent?"

"Excellent, excellent!"

Hearing the Heavenly Master’s words was like parting clouds to behold the sun—no different indeed.

"You may now be said to have grasped the intent of the Dao."

"This foolish student, favored by your grace, has gained great understanding. Yet I shall have no end of questions—only may the Heavenly Master admonish and caution me again and again."

"Indeed, only one who deeply nurtures the self can nurture others. Only one who deeply cherishes the self can cherish others. If one neglects one’s own body and fails to nurture oneself, how can one generously nurture others? If one cannot cherish and preserve one’s own body, carefully guarding the ancestral lineage of one’s forebears, how can one cherish and preserve others? How foolish! Do you now deeply comprehend this?"

"Indeed, indeed. Excellent, excellent!"

"Very well. You seem to doubt that my writings can be trusted. Then take the writings of those from the high antiquity who followed the Dao and won the heart of Heaven, enjoying long-lasting fortune; then take the writings of those from the middle antiquity who followed the Dao and won the heart of Heaven; then take the writings of those from the lower antiquity who devoted themselves to the Dao, won the favor of Heaven, and long preserved themselves. Examine them all, from beginning to end, and you will find they align perfectly with my words, like matching compass and square. Only now have you gained great understanding, and only later will you come to trust my writings completely.

Nowadays, people grow ever more reckless, and the younger generations daily become more frivolous, contending over fate and testing their talents. The most foolish even claim that Heaven has no Dao and that Heaven does not respond. Yet even the earth does not deceive: plant millet and you reap millet; plant wheat and you reap wheat. The more effort and toil one invests, the finer the harvest. How much more so with Heaven?

Now Heaven has accumulated resentment, while the ignorant below teach one another to treat matters lightly, calling it wisdom. The younger generations grow ever more perverse, and thus arise calamities, anomalies, and strange omens—not just one or two. Heaven’s kindness to the lord of men is as deep as the bond between father and son, and it instructs him accordingly. Yet fools, seeing this, do not admonish their lord in due time; instead, they conceal and obstruct, severing the path to Heaven. Heaven grows ever more indignant, and later generations inherit the burden, worsening it beyond remedy. Though the emperor may possess the goodness of ten thousand men, he will still suffer harm without cause. Thus, those who do good are left in obscurity, as if their efforts were of no benefit. Is there not reason, then, for the foolish to claim that Heaven is without knowledge?"

"Now, hearing the Heavenly Master’s words, my heart feels as though it has been reborn—no different indeed. Excellent, excellent! Though this disciple has often troubled the Heavenly Master, risking death to ask these questions—beginning as if in error—I have now gained understanding and am overjoyed, with no regrets. For without knowledge, one does not ask, and without asking, one cannot attain clarity."

"Your words express the right intent. Very well. The writings are complete in every part—head, feet, belly, back, surface, and core—just as they were composed together with the many worthies. Do not ask further."

"Indeed, indeed."

The above documents addressed to the Heavenly Master span many matters from beginning to end, with decisions rendered. *The Forty-Eighth Method: Explanation of the Law of Karmic Inheritance*

An ignorant disciple bows twice and says: "The greatly wise, upon hearing the Master speak of one aspect, understand the explanations of the four aspects; the lesser wise, upon hearing the Master speak of one karmic burden, understand the explanations of the four burdens—thus is it easy for them to comprehend. But those who are foolish, benighted, and dull-witted, even when matters are shown and explained to them, still harbor doubts in their hearts. Therefore, I dare to present my questions to the Heavenly Master in full.

*Beginning here:*
Since the Master has resolved the karmic debts of retribution for High Heaven, lifted the karmic calamities of retribution for the Earth, dispelled the karmic misfortunes of retribution for emperors and kings, absolved the karmic transgressions of retribution for the common people, and relieved the karmic obligations of retribution for the twelve thousand beings..."
*Ending here.*

Moreover, this dull disciple ventures to inquire of Heaven, not daring to conceal any transgressions but to lay them all bare. I wish to hear in full: what is the meaning of this?

"Speak plainly."

"Now, if emperors, kings, and the people bear karmic inheritance, do all matters likewise possess their own karmic inheritance?"

"Excellent! You inquire of Heaven with such sincerity and care."

"Whenever I meet with the Heavenly Master, I always say that this disciple ventures to ask about matters of doubt on Heaven’s behalf—thus I dare not be anything but thorough."

"Excellent! You possess a mind both cautious and upright, and may be entrusted with affairs. Now, do you wish me to explain everything in full? I do not begrudge the difficulty, but fear the text may be too vast, making it hard to apply. To fully expound the karmic inheritance of the world would require no fewer than ten million words. Since this would be difficult to bear, I shall instead outline its general principles for you, so that all worthies may grasp the intent together—no different from a written contract."

"As the Heavenly Master says."

"Open both ears clearly, sit calmly, and listen with a settled mind."
"Yes, yes."

"Now then—Heaven and Earth give birth to all things, yet if one harms them without virtue, the world becomes clouded in chaos: households grow poor and wanting, the old and weak suffer cold and hunger, the county collects no taxes, and granaries stand ever empty. This misfortune originates in the harm done to things by Earth, yet people instead bear its burden. This is the first general principle—listen again with greater clarity.

If one master teaches ten disciples, and that master’s teaching is false and insincere, those ten disciples each go on to teach ten more, and already a hundred have heard falsehood. Those hundred each teach ten, and a thousand are misled; those thousand each teach ten, and ten thousand embrace false teachings. When ten thousand speak in all directions, the world is filled with error. Moreover, as the number of speakers grows vast, their words spread and confirm one another, becoming irreversible—hence they become the accepted doctrine. This began with a single person’s misstatement, yet it has caused all ordinary people to lose the true standard, throwing Heaven’s correct scriptures into disorder, shifting customs and altering mores. The world takes this as a grave affliction, yet cannot put a stop to it. Later generations suffer even more severely—this is the calamity of karmic inheritance, and clearly not the fault of those who come after.

Later ages, unaware of how distant its origins lie, instead blame their contemporaries, thus compounding the injustice. The resentment festers, the qi remains unresolved, and the harm grows daily worse. This is the second principle—Perfected One, listen again with greater clarity.

Suppose one man in a bustling city spreads a great deception, walking through the marketplace in all directions, wailing as he declares that the earth is about to collapse into a vast flood. The people of the city return and repeat his words, and ten thousand households learn of it. The old and young, great and small, all spread the tale, until the whole world knows—and thus the whole world is deceived. Later generations embellish the story, and those farthest removed suffer the most. This began with one man’s words—this is the burden of bearing responsibility for empty falsehoods. What fault lies with those who come after? Yet they are blamed instead. This is the third principle—Perfected One, listen again with greater clarity.

There stands on South Mountain a great tree, its canopy spreading hundreds of paces across the earth, yet its trunk is but one. Above, its branches, leaves, and fruits are beyond count; below, its roots do not hold firmly to the earth. When great wind and rain assail it, the countless branches, leaves, and fruits above are all damaged and die. This is the great karmic burden borne by the grasses and trees of the world. The fault lies in the root, not the branches, yet are those branches not wronged by being blamed? Now the branches bear no fault, yet suffer the flowing disaster of death without cause. Such is the nature of karmic inheritance—how can later generations be held guilty?

This is the fourth principle—Perfected One, listen again with greater clarity.

On South Mountain there is a poisonous qi. The mountain fails to contain it, and when the spring south wind blows, it carries the qi forth, obscuring the sun and moon. The world bears the blame for this, and the dead from its harm pile up in great numbers. Yet this poisonous qi originated solely from South Mountain’s release—why then do the people of the world bear its burden, falling ill and dying? Contemporaries say, ‘You are evil, therefore Heaven kills you,’ blaming the people. Is this not grievous injustice? These people bear no fault, yet suffer this disaster. Their souls cry out in grievance, and the living further blame them, their resentment congealing into qi that rises to move Heaven. The fault lies originally in the mountain’s evil wind—such is the burden of karmic inheritance.

This is the fifth principle—Perfected One, sit upright once more and listen carefully to my words.

The primordial Dao is always correct, never false or deceptive. Yet people, following the teachings of their ancestors, rulers, teachers, and fathers, have allowed small deviations from correctness—deviations in speech, in the correct Way of self-nurturance. They imitate one another, and later generations grow daily worse. The cause lies here. Over time, as teachings are passed down, none grasp the truth, and the world is filled with error, unable to restrain itself. Thus disasters and anomalies arise in countless forms, beyond reckoning—this is the result of long and ever longer accumulation.

The foolish, knowing nothing, instead blame their contemporary rulers and hold their own generation responsible. Are they not deeply wronged? The world is filled with error, yet none realize it. Though an emperor may possess the virtue of ten thousand men, what can he alone do? Yet now, how can people’s conduct be resolved? If food is exhausted and one desires more, yet the sick cannot eat and so perish—how can this be resolved? Now, in the interplay of yin and yang, all find complete joy. Yet though one has descendants who make offerings to the spirits seeking blessings, one remains childless—how can this be resolved?

People live in perfect joy, doing good and growing strong, yet suddenly become unworthy and evil—how can this be resolved? All these are the great effects of karmic inheritance. Yet people blame their contemporaries, and so governance cannot be made equitable. The transmission of error and falsehood has gone on too long—how can it be suddenly corrected? Thus the injustice continues, becoming entrenched over time, and Heaven takes pity.

Therefore, the August Way descends in response to the primordial qi. Do not find this strange.

What is the beginning? It is to contemplate and guard the One. Why? The One is the beginning of numbers; the One is the Dao of life; the One is the origin of primordial qi; the One is the guiding principle of Heaven. Thus one is made to guard and contemplate the One, from above to below.

When the affairs of the myriad things grow too great, and their branches do not return to their root, they become deeply confused and cannot be resolved—thus they must return to the root.

To resolve the burden of karmic inheritance, nothing is better than guarding the One. Guard the One for long, and Heaven will take pity. The One is the guiding principle of Heaven, the root of the myriad things. Contemplate the root, and its influence will extend to the branches.

Thus, when the sages of antiquity were about to undertake great deeds, they always looked up to observe the celestial patterns and looked down to examine the earth’s principles—clearly demonstrating the luminous efficacy of returning to the root."

"Does the Perfected One understand?"
"Yes, yes."
"Now you seem troubled—having just raised the initial cause of karmic inheritance, all matters under Heaven that involve karmic succession are like this. Do you comprehend?"
"Yes, yes. Now that the Heavenly Master has fully expounded the initial cause, this foolish student’s mental knot is untied."
"Good. Let me tell the Perfected One one crucial teaching: those in high antiquity who attained the Dao and were able to bring order to their governance simply excelled at self-cultivation, guarding their root. Those in middle antiquity who slightly lost it merely grew somewhat negligent in self-cultivation, losing their root. Those in later antiquity, failing to consider carefully, treated their bodies lightly, believing they could regain it again—thus they greatly lost it and threw their governance into chaos. Yet this is not the fault of the people of later antiquity; it is due to the adversity of karmic succession. The text has already repeated this heavily—I shall not speak further. A hundred words would be a hundred repetitions, to no benefit. Do not add more writing to the text. Today, the discourse has already been clearly entrusted to the Perfected One."
"Yes, yes."
"Go now, reflect on its essentials, and transmit them to a virtuous lord. Write the essentials to resolve karmic inheritance."
"Yes, yes."

The Master said:
〈Begin〉
"My graph ‘eleven’ with ‘bright’ as its end,
Bing-wu and Ding-si mark the ancestral origin.
Four mouths govern affairs and the principles of the myriad things;
The *zi*-cap and *yong*-horn govern the right,
The hidden dragon unused—*Kan* as its guiding thread.
Those who attain this vision live long,
Dwelling between heaven and earth, merely alive.
Governing a million people, immortality awaits;
He who skillfully heals illness must not deceive.
No joy surpasses the everlasting market of Chang’an,
Granting men a lifespan like the Queen Mother of the West,
Comparable to the four seasons cycling back to their beginning.
Ninety characters of the divination text—transmit them to the fangshi."

〈Begin〉
The Perfected One bowed twice and said, "Yes, yes.
I humbly request the resolution of a single doubt."
"Speak plainly—what is it?"
"The divination text of ninety characters Your Celestial Master previously bestowed upon this dull and uncomprehending student.
I respectfully retired to a secluded chamber, dwelling in solitude for days and hours.
My nature is dull and slow; day and night I pondered it without敢懈怠,
Expending my essence and exhausting my heart, yet could not grasp its meaning in full.
Now, I can only hope Your Celestial Master will take pity on this uncomprehending student
And deign to explain it in full, that it may be transmitted through ten thousand generations,
Bound together and never forgotten."
"Excellent indeed is your difficult question—you may be called a celestial being.
Very well.
Perfected One, listen carefully; I shall fully explain its essential meaning for you."
〈End〉

**Addendum**
The Perfected One asked the Divine Person:
"The divination text of ninety characters previously bestowed upon this uncomprehending student—
I do not yet know its direction or where its principles lead.
I wish for a thorough explanation, to bequeath it to later generations,
Bound together and never forgotten."
The Divine Person said: "I shall explain it to you directly."

〈Continuing〉

The Master said: "My name's eleven characters signify *stopping at illumination*: *Shi* (Master) refers precisely to the Master of August Heaven and the Divine Persons. *Yue* (says) is speech—my words ascend to Heaven, where I personally received the mandate, then descended to fully expound them for emperors, kings, and the myriad people, resolving the karmic retributions of *chengfu* that span hundreds of thousands of generations.

*Wu* (I) is myself; I am the divine person urgently dispatched by Heaven. Now, the disasters of *chengfu* flow in all four directions, tracing back to their root. Those who govern afterward all lose their way in following them, unable to sever or halt the cycle. Instead, they harm one another, causing profound suffering. Heaven regards this as a grave concern.

*Zi* (character) refers to the accumulated characters of the Heavenly Scriptures I now set forth. *Shi* (ten) means the scripture aligns perfectly with the true sincerity of Heaven—ten times ten, without a single falsehood. Those who obtain it, the many worthies, will each reflect deeply: their ancestors all bore *chengfu*. If they recite it without cease, the calamities of *chengfu*, great and small, will all be eradicated.

*Yi* (one) signifies that the essential Dao is upright and begins with *guarding the One*. If one guards the One without wavering, their understanding will grow daily, and profound delusion will dissolve. *Ming* (illumination) *zhi wei zhi* (stops at stopping): *zhi* (stopping) means sufficiency. Sufficiency enables life to proceed. Those who practice this Dao will only grow clearer with each day, never again sinking into ignorance and darkness.

The eleven characters form *shi* (scholar-official). *Ming zhi wei zhi* (illumination stops at stopping) is *chi* (crimson)—it means that when crimson *qi* attains this, it will flourish anew, and the king’s great illumination will shine. *Zhi* (stopping) is the sufficiency of the myriad things. When the myriad things first sprout, they spread their roots to establish their foundational sufficiency. Practicing this Dao restores the original *qi*, aligning with the heart of Heaven and Earth. It is the foremost and most excellent, thus called the Dao of the Supreme Sovereign.

*Bingwu ding-si* mark the ancestral beginning: *Bingwu* and *ding-si* are fire, crimson. *Bingwu* is pure yang; *ding-si* is pure yin. Yin and yang govern harmony. In all matters concerning yin and yang *qi*, they should harmonize and revitalize the world. *Wei* (to be) means to benefit emperors and kings by eliminating misfortune and peril. *Zu* (ancestor) means the first, embodying the virtue of the Three Sovereigns. *Shi* (beginning) means returning to the original source. Thus, practicing this Dao will restore the era of the Supreme Sovereign.

*Si kou zhi shi wanwu li* (Four mouths govern affairs, the principles of the myriad things): *Si* (four) with *kou* (mouth) means speech. Those who daily recite my scripture will obtain the true celestial characters, grasping their ultimate meaning. This aligns with the heart of Heaven, allowing the myriad things to each find their proper place without disorder—hence, the principles of the myriad things.

*Zi jin yong jiao zhi qi you* (The child’s kerchief uses the horn to govern its right): This refers to recitation. Reciting this scripture without cease will rectify all matters in an instant, aligning with Heaven’s will. Joy will be constant, with no lingering regrets.

*Qian long wu yong kan wei ji* (The hidden dragon is not used; *kan* serves as the record): The *qian long* (hidden dragon) is the returning *qi* of the first nine, the *jiazi* year. It is the day of the winter solstice, when Heaven and Earth begin anew. The dragon is the lesser yang of the east, the spirit of wood. Thus, the Dao of Heaven emerges through wood to activate the fire phase. When things are about to flourish, they must first open their gates.

When the Perfected One reaches the appointed time and the month is full, this scripture should be cast into an open and luminous place. *Kai* (open) means to clear, to unblock, to reach. Opening the south will further harmonize the yang *qi*, dissolving the calamitous gatherings of *chengfu*.

*Qian* (hidden) means to conceal, as the Dao, having reached its destination, retreats and hides. *Wu* (not) means dare not or not yet. Those who first see the text do not yet know how to practice it. *Yong* (use) means to govern, to act. Heaven now intends this scripture to eliminate disasters.

If it emerges in a *xuanjia* year, the ruler of that time may not deeply fathom its meaning or be able to apply it. Thus, it says *wu yong* (not used)—seeing the celestial patterns, one dare not rashly implement it. Those who trust and apply it will see immediate results, a clear resonance. This alignment with Heaven is why there is resonance.

*Kan wei ji* (*kan* serves as the record): *Zi* (child) is called *kan*. *Jia* is Heaven, the guiding principle, yang. *Kan* is the child, water, yin, the record. Thus, Heaven and Earth are always united, their guiding principles recorded in the initial emergence of *xuanjiazi*. This can serve as the guiding principle for a virtuous ruler—hence, *kan wei ji*.

This is the Supreme Sovereign’s Heavenly Scripture, revealed to virtuous rulers as the true canon. The scripture severs deviance with a cord, taking *xuanjia* as its subtle beginning. All things that arise take *jia* as their head and *zi* as their root—thus, it is presented in sequence from *jiazi*.

Those who see it will enjoy long life: *Ren* (person) refers specifically to the emperor, the one of supreme virtue who readily awakens to and practices the scripture. According to the auspicious signs, they do not doubt the Dao of Heaven. Deeply grasping its meaning, they attain longevity. *Shou* (longevity) means fulfilling one’s heavenly years. *Chang* (long) means boundless. *Jiu* (durable) means enduring.

*Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, merely alive*: *Ju* (dwelling) means to reside. To reside between Heaven and Earth and merely be alive is to study the true Dao. Fleeting and ornate texts cannot sustain life. The calamities of *chengfu* all stem from insubstantial doctrines—Heaven now severs them.

*Governing a million people, immortality awaits*: *Zhi* (governing) means to rectify. Heaven uses this scripture to rectify the hearts of the many worthies, each healing their illnesses, guarding the true and expelling the deviant. *Xian ke dai* (immortality awaits) means that when the world hears of it, the true Dao will flourish and emerge, rushing to assist the virtuous ruler. Practicing the true Dao is the method to enliven people—hence, immortality awaits.

*Those who skillfully heal illnesses must not deceive or endanger*: All people are foolish, failing to consider their own well-being. They all use false and deceptive texts, needlessly deceiving and endangering themselves—how lamentable!"

Reversing their fate, they incur Heaven’s severe punishment and bear the great burden of *chengfu*. Thus Heaven compels them to abandon florid texts and each hold fast to what is true and real, preserving it through diligent practice day and night. This enables every person to benefit their own body, so that none will again deceive or endanger themselves.

*"Joy in the Chang’an marketplace"*: *Joy* means nothing brings greater joy than the advent of the Supreme Peace *qi* from the Heavenly Emperor. *Hu* expresses awe at the singularly vast and unmatched virtue. *Long* signifies that those who practice this Dao will see their virtue and goodness endure without end. *An* means no further peril or ruin. Those who enact this Dao will see all *chengfu* punishments from Heaven and Earth dispelled, and thus abide in boundless, expansive peace, free from care. *Market* refers to the place where all under Heaven gather together. Those who practice this scripture will see the nation’s people flourish abundantly, like the throngs in a bustling marketplace.

*"Granting people a lifespan like the Queen Mother of the West"*: *Granting people* refers to emperors and kings who possess Heavenly virtue and delight in enacting upright texts. *Ru* means compliance—those who fully comply with this scripture follow the Heavenly Dao, and those who attain it will know great fortune, free from misfortune. *West* signifies that all people dwell in the true Dao within their hearts. *King* denotes that emperors who govern by upholding the Heavenly Dao will flourish and reign, their governance so excellent it is peerless. *Mother* is the proof of long life, the elder of the spirits.

*"Like the four seasons returning in cycle"*: *Bi* means comparison—just as the four seasons succeed one another, generating and completing each other without mutual harm or injury, so too will their governance be free of punishment.

*"The ninety-character talisman is transmitted to the fangshi"*: *Nine* signifies thoroughness and completion—those who practice this will see their virtue thoroughly harmonize with the hearts of Heaven, Earth, yin, yang, and the myriad things. *Ten* means tenfold resonance, free of contrived texts. *Character* refers to the celestial script above and below, circulating fully through the Dao. *Transmit* means trust, and thus written proof is created to transmit it faithfully. *Fang* signifies great rectitude—holding fast to this Dao and swiftly conveying it to a virtuous ruler can dispel the misfortunes of *chengfu*, and their governance will be upright and greatly correct. *Shi* refers to those of resolute will and single-minded purpose—such individuals, with sincere hearts, can be instructed and entrusted with this task, sent forth to propagate this Dao.

The efficacy of my talisman’s teachings will soon be witnessed. 〈End〉

*Perfected One, do you now understand?*
*"Indeed, indeed. Excellent! Excellent!"*

"Hearing the Celestial Master’s words, great joy has now arrived."

"You may be said to have truly understood."

"This humble student often has questions, yet I know my frequent inquiries burden the Celestial Master. If I did not ask, how could I come to know?"

"Indeed, your words are correct. Even the wise and sagely have doubts, which is why they all seek teachers. One must not speak idly or force explanations—for forced speech may suffice for a single utterance, but cannot be extended further."

"Indeed, indeed. That is why this humble student dares not speak without certainty."

"Your words are correct. A great scholar’s humility does not lead him astray."

"Now, the Celestial Master, in every matter, opens the path to resolve the doubts of the common, even addressing what I had not yet asked. Yet I now wish to beg another question—though it seems immodest, I do not know whether it is proper to speak or not."

"Speak plainly without reservation if you have doubts."

"Indeed, indeed. From ancient times to the present, the wise and sagely have all had teachers. Now, the Celestial Master’s Dao overflows—whom, then, do you take as your teacher?"

"Excellent! Excellent! Your question reveals a keen insight. When I first began my studies, I too inquired of teachers—not just one, but many. Only after the Dao was perfected and virtue accomplished did I ascend to align my will with Heaven. Then, I came to know what Heaven wished to say, and Heaven sent the spirit of the Great Yang to inform me, bidding me to speak. Thus, I take Heaven itself as my teacher. Though I explain this to you, a Perfected One, if Heaven did not wish it spoken, I would not dare utter such words recklessly—Heaven would surely punish me. Do you, Perfected One, understand the gravity of this truth? Be cautious in this."

"Indeed, indeed. This humble student’s doubts, when asked of the Celestial Master, are never left unresolved. My heart rejoices so that I cannot restrain my words. I wish to beg one more question."

"Proceed with the Dao."

"Indeed, indeed. Recently, the Celestial Master has explained the doctrine of *chengfu* to this ignorant and shallow student. But are *cheng* and *fu* the same or different?"

"Ah, *cheng* refers to what comes before, and *fu* to what follows. *Cheng* means that one’s ancestors originally acted in accord with Heaven’s will, yet made minor errors unknowingly. Over time, these accumulated, and now later generations, though innocent, suffer their consequences, inheriting their misfortunes. Thus, what precedes is *cheng*, and what follows is *fu*. As for *fu*, the flow of calamity does not arise from the governance of a single person—it connects and compounds, with earlier and later generations bearing it in turn. Hence, it is called *fu*. *Fu* means that ancestors impose upon their descendants. Illnesses and misfortunes are passed down in this way, and disasters cannot be easily eradicated. When one is cut off, another arises. I reverently received this scripture from Heaven, for this Dao alone can wholly sever such cycles. Thus, it is most precious and without equal. Do you, Perfected One, understand?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"Most wondrous! Most wondrous!"
"Go now, ask no more."
"Yes, yes."

*Right: Explanation of the Master’s Cipher Text of Ninety Characters*
*True Contract Formula Fifty-First*

The Perfected One stepped forward and asked, "Of all matters under Heaven, which are right and which are wrong?"
"When tested, they yield immediate response, affairs reach fruition, and those afflicted with knotted illnesses find relief—these are all right. When tested, matters fail to respond, actions bear no success, and those with knotted illnesses remain unresolved—these are all wrong, and not the fault of any single person."
"Excellent! Your words are truly so. Though few, they suffice to resolve ten thousand myriad affairs. I have nothing to add to your words. If one wishes to discern right from wrong, all must be measured by this standard. Cast aside all doubt, for this is the talisman that summons truth."
"What does this mean?"
"In all matters, whether trustworthy or not, why must one necessarily investigate and question? The sages and worthies of old simply observed the evidence of a person’s conduct to know the truth—clear as the sun and moon. Your teaching on the accumulation of good is immutable. If you wish to understand my scripture, take all proof and verification from this. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Yes, yes."

"Go forth with this, and call it the True Contract. Guard it well, and do not cast it into the lower realms—let it serve as your decisive strategy and written decree."

*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll 40: "Exerting Effort in the Good Dao, Fifty-Second"*

"Perfected One, how many adversities do the people of the world generally face?"
"What do you mean?"
"I speak of those who are ordinary and unmatched—how many pressing adversities do people endure? Though their adversities are many, are none of them named?"
"They cannot be named."
"You do not yet know. The people of the world face four adversities."
"What are they?"
"First, when one is born of parents, in youth one cannot bear to leave their side—this is the first adversity. Next, as one grows and matures, a woman wishes to marry, a man to take a wife; unable to overcome their passions, they become bound by love and cannot part—this is the second adversity. Then, having fallen in love and borne children, as husband and wife age, their appearance becomes unlovely, while their young children are dear and must be cared for—this is the third adversity. Finally, when the children have grown and no longer need support, one ages further and can no longer move about—this is the fourth adversity. After these four adversities, if one finds a wise teacher and reflects deeply to uphold the Dao, it is still possible. Those of exceptional talent with heavenly mandate may attain liberation; others may gain longevity; still others may enjoy brief happiness in life, while their hun and po dwell below the earth, where they may once more experience joy."
"What does this mean?"
"In the underworld, the newly deceased are all questioned about their actions and experiences in life. Based on these, their names are recorded in the registers, and they are held accountable for their deeds. Thus, one must take precautions in all matters, for safety and peril are both determined by one’s own actions. Perfected One, be vigilant. Do you heed this warning?"

""Yes, yes. The Celestial Master has instructed me with teachings unseen before."
"So it is. The reason I instruct and teach you is that I see you constantly harbor good intentions. I fear the Perfected One may grow weary, thus I clearly demonstrate these admonitions."
"Yes, yes."
"Perfected One, what do you now seek in your studies?"
"I seek to reach the very end of my years."
"Excellent is your aspiration—this may indeed be called grasping the intent of the Dao. Yet, in all human conduct, one takes the end of life as the limit, differing only in whether good or evil is exhausted."
"What does this mean? I wish to hear it."
"Those who maintain goodness in their studies, pass their lives in joy and pleasure, become joyful wandering ghosts, and by law do not encounter sorrow or suffering. Those who exhaust themselves in sorrow become sorrowful ghosts, while those who exhaust themselves in evil become evil ghosts. These are all manifest matters, knowable to all. Yet people refuse to do good and delight their hun and shen—truly, their transgression is grave."
"What does this mean?"
"Human life receives the true qi of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons and five phases, uniting to form a person—this is the inherited body of one’s ancestors. This body may dwell within Heaven, Earth, the four seasons, and the five phases. The bodies of the ancestors ever delight in goodness and know no sorrow, cycling endlessly through rebirth. Yet later generations, unworthy, instead long afflict the body of Heaven, Earth, the four seasons, and the five phases, causing it to suffer unjust death, still grieving their hun and po. Thus, the foolish scholar, failing to consider deeply, cannot long endure. Therefore, they hasten toward death, and upon dying, harbor no regret. The spirit merely pities itself in vain, needlessly incurring sorrow and resentment among these lesser beings. For this reason, the great sages of antiquity, considering deeply and planning far ahead, knew this well—thus they studied without cease.

Those who, as rulers, delight in contemplating great peace, align with the heart of Heaven, and their merit is doubled. Their hun and shen ever wander in joy, uniting with the good qi of Heaven. Those who cannot bring order to their governance fail to align with Heaven’s heart, do not gain Heaven’s favor, and achieve no merit in the heavens above. When their end comes, their hun and shen are held solely accountable in the underworld, dwelling with evil qi. Thus, the supreme sages of highest antiquity knew this well—hence their diligence. The foolish, failing to consider deeply, incur punishment from Heaven in life and from Earth in death—how terrifying!

"Your disciple is dull and ignorant; I do not wish to hear this."
"Excellent! Since you have come to study, if you do not wish to hear this, then strive earnestly to do good."
"Yes, yes. Celestial Master, dwelling in this realm, you have allowed me to know Heaven’s mandate and receive profound instruction. How may one escape this fate?"
"Well said! You need only urgently transmit my writings on the Dao, so that all under Heaven may practice them, all contemplating their true essence, their thoughts aligning with the Great Dao. Then, knowing the source of their transgressions, the burden of inherited responsibility will be lifted. Heaven and Earth will rejoice greatly, and the years may return to the age of highest antiquity, even doubled."

"Enough!" "Excellent, excellent!"

"Go now, the minor discourse is complete. Divine One, exert yourself diligently; return another day."
"Yes, yes."

"Having received the writings, ponder them thoroughly from beginning to end. To study without mastery is to remain in vagueness; seeking affairs without form or image, thoughts unrefined, the spirit has no means to proceed."

"Excellent, excellent!"

**Right: The Celestial Master’s Admonition—On the Burden of Inherited Responsibility for Those Who Fail to Exert Themselves in Life and Die as Wandering Spirits**
**Method for Resolving Origins and Ends, Fifty-Third**

"Divine One, step forward. Since you have come to study, should one broadly comprehend the intent of the Dao—is it better to follow few or many?"
"Indeed, one fully equipped with abundance may follow many."
"Alas! You have not yet broadly grasped the essential intent of the Dao."

"Now, Heaven is One, yet in reverse it becomes Earth as Two—what is the meaning? Earth is Two, yet in reverse it becomes Man as Three—why? This foolish student wishes to hear the intent of their mutual operation."
"Very well. Earth serves as Heaven’s agent, and Man serves as Earth’s agent. Thus, when Heaven is pleased, it commands the Earth to make all things upon it greatly flourish this year. When Heaven is not pleased, though Earth may wish to nurture, it causes things to turn foul. When Earth is good, those dwelling upon it—its people—turn to goodness. This is the clear effect of their mutual agency.

Thus, the causes of order and chaos are manifold. When one fails to align with Heaven’s heart, one must return to the root. When a person’s words are excessive yet fail to reveal truth, one must return to the essential root—only then may their words and affairs stand firm.

Therefore, a single word that succeeds is its original text; a second iteration halts at forming phrases. A third word halts and instead becomes an explanation of difficulty, drifting far from truth—hence the need for clarification. A fourth word halts and reverts to rhetoric; a fifth reverts to falsehood; a sixth to deception; a seventh to destruction; an eighth to dispersion, estrangement from the Dao, and ever-greater distance; a ninth to great chaos; a tenth to annihilation and ruin.

Thus, classics change at ten, and further transmission leads to corruption and collapse. In all matters of ruin, one must return to the root—revert to the One as the primordial beginning. Therefore, Heaven’s numbers begin at One and end at Ten; this is the natural nature of the Heavenly Dao.

Thus, the sages of antiquity, when inquiring into affairs, first divined once—its auspice or inauspice was so, guarding the root, for the Celestial Spirits descended to inform them. A second divination was informed by the Earth Spirits; a third by the Human Spirits. Beyond this, all is deception and unfit for divination. Thus, hexagram numbers miss the mark, and excessive human rhetoric loses its value."

"Excellent! Excellent! Now, as the Celestial Master always pities those who fall short, I humbly beg one more word!"
"Proceed calmly!"

"Why do numbers end at Ten?"
"Excellent! You have grasped the essence of this question’s method. Now—Heaven’s numbers begin at One and end at Ten—why?

Heaven is initially One, descending to unite with Earth as Two, where Yin and Yang are complete and jointly generate. All things first sprout in the North, the primordial *qi* arising at *zi*, turning to the Northeast to spread roots at *jiao*, turning to the East to emerge and flourish, turning to the Southeast to grow branches and leaves, turning to the South to thrive, turning to the Southwest to incline toward abundance, turning to the West to mature, turning to the Northwest to conclude.

When things conclude, they must return to the beginning—thus *hai*, where two embrace One, becomes the origin of the Three Sovereigns. Therefore, *hai* is the kernel, the first coagulation of the seed—hence water begins to congeal in the tenth month. *Ren* is *ren* (to bear), for once borne, it must grow daily greater. Thus *zi* is growth, and at Three, the *qi* of Yin and Yang achieves harmony, all fully formed, returning to the initial arising—hence reverting to the root, named *jiazi*.

The Dao of Heaven in generating things must circulate completely, observing the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases to achieve completion. If one *qi* is insufficient, there is immediately deficiency. Thus, the root lies in the circulation of Heaven and Earth through the eight directions—all numbers reach completion at Ten."

"Divine One, do you now understand?"
"Yes, yes. Excellent, excellent!"

"Truly, I have received profound grace."
"Do not express gratitude, why so? The merit of master and disciple is vast and weighty—comparable to parents giving birth to a child, which cannot be repaid or dissolved through thanks."

"Pray, what do you mean?"
"Before parents give birth to a child, fools may cast their seed carelessly into the wild, where it takes root in the earth and grows into grasses or trees, unaware that it was meant to become human. How could such a reckless offering ever speak? Thus it becomes mere vegetation. Only when Yin and Yang unite does a child come to be—how could this compare to becoming grasses or trees?

Once born, if a person fails to seek a worthy master and instead follows a base and foolish one, they are taught evil, led into depravity, and may even cause death and destruction. Their own transgressions remain, and their entire household is ruined. Some are born yet never pursue learning, becoming fools. Such ignorant ones live in sorrow and die in suffering, their sins lingering even in the underworld. Their souls, unable to roam freely or find joy, cannot even become benevolent spirits after death.

Yet a worthy master teaches even the lowliest and most ignorant, transforming them into good people. If they persist in goodness without ceasing, they become virtuous; if they persist in virtue, they attain wisdom; if they persist in wisdom, they gain deep understanding of the true Dao; if they persist in guarding the Dao, they attain immortality; if they persist in immortality, they become perfected beings; if they persist in perfection, they become divine; if they persist in divinity, their virtue equals that of Heaven; if they persist in equaling Heaven, their virtue equals that of primordial *qi*. Primordial *qi* envelops the eight directions of Heaven and Earth—nothing exists that does not receive its breath and come to life.

Virtue then extends to cover the eight directions of Heaven and Earth, and the spirit draws sustenance from them. All under Heaven offer sacrifices and partake in its bounty, yet they remain ever fearful of negligence, unable to fully attain it. Such is the merit of a worthy master who cultivates a good disciple—how could one ever express sufficient gratitude?"

"Most astonishing! This foolish one has spoken carelessly, transgressing taboos."

“””Why so unceasingly modest? You are a perfected being indeed. Master Xingjue has made you understand whether gratitude can be expressed or not.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

*Here ends the discourse on the essential principles of merit between fathers and sons, masters and disciples.*

**Chapter 54: Lesheng’s Attainment of the Heavenly Heart Method**

[Opening]
The perfected one continued, “In the conduct of ordinary people and the governance of kings, what is the most excellent?”

“To extend compassion without harm—this, like the movement of Heaven, is the most excellent.”

“Your words may be said to grasp the intent of the Dao. Yet in governance, nothing surpasses emulating Heaven. That said, there must be an order of precedence.”

“What do you mean? This foolish one may strain to speak once, but will not presume to do so again. May the Heavenly Master expound it?”

“Very well. The conduct of ordinary people and the governance of kings—what is most excellent in human affairs? Nothing surpasses constantly desiring to delight in life, eagerly as one parched with thirst. Only then is it permissible.

Next, nothing surpasses delighting in accomplishment, ever yearning to bring things to fruition as though grieving for one’s own body. Only then is it permissible.

Next, nothing surpasses excelling in benevolent bestowal—when seeing others in poverty and want, to feel sorrow for them as though grieving over one’s own hunger and cold. Only then is it permissible.

Next, nothing surpasses skillfully establishing laws, not delighting in harm but merely acting out of fear. Only then is it permissible.

Next, when people commit transgressions, nothing surpasses governing them without driving them into crime. Only then is it permissible.

Next, when people have already fallen into crime, to refrain from deeply harming them in one’s heart. Only then is it permissible.

Next, when people commit capital offenses and matters are beyond remedy, to ensure their punishment does not extend to their families or neighbors. Only then is it permissible.

Next, when crimes reach families and neighbors, to wish to single out only the guilty, taking care never to exterminate an entire lineage. Only then is it permissible.

For humans are the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth. Extermination is called severing the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth, inflicting grievous harm upon the very body of Heaven and Earth. The damage is profound, and in time, Heaven will exterminate the human world in turn.

It is no easy matter to become the ancestor of a family. One ought to consider posterity and not impose the calamity of inherited burden upon descendants. Thus, the sage in governance constantly contemplates great peace, ensuring that punishments are established but unused. The reason for this is to consider posterity.

Now, perfected one, have you grasped these subtle words?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

[End]

[Appendix] Someone asked: “Among the ways of governance by emperors, kings, and feudal lords, which is most excellent?”

The reply: “To extend compassion without harm—this, like the movement of Heaven, is most excellent.”

“In governance, nothing surpasses mirroring the great image of Heaven. Yet there must be degrees of priority.”

“What does this mean?”

“Of all things most excellent, nothing surpasses delighting in life, hastening to it as if parched with thirst—only then is it permissible. Next is to rejoice in others’ goodness as one’s own. Next is to bestow upon others: when seeing the destitute, to regard their sorrowful hearts as if suffering hunger and cold—only then is it permissible. Next is to establish laws, merely to instill fear and thereby restrain—only then is it permissible. Next, when one commits a grave offense, in governance, to avoid driving them into transgression—only then is it permissible. Next, when one commits an offense or violates the law, if the matter is unavoidable, to ensure it does not implicate their family or neighbors—only then is it permissible. Next, when punishment extends to neighbors, to single out only the guilty, taking care never to cut off their lineage.

Humans are the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth. To harm the body of Heaven and Earth is to invite profound calamity. Do not impose the calamity of inherited burden upon descendants. Constantly contemplate great peace to dispel the need for punishments.”

“Perfected one, proceed.”

“Yes, yes.”

“Perfected One, Perfected One, have you nothing more to say? Are you merely being modest?”

“In a single word: my lineage is bound to the earth, my fate tied to Kunlun. Today, the Celestial Master’s mandate resides in Heaven, in the Purple Palace of the North Pole. Now the earth stands in emptiness; I reverently receive Heaven’s dispensation. As a disciple, I must comply and submit, emulating the earth’s empty heart to respectfully receive the Celestial Master’s teachings. Only then may the essential words of the supreme Dao be... ... ... ... without the bond of master and disciple. Merely calling it an exchange... ... ... ... ... would be to confuse learning with impurity. ... ... ... ... ... ... If decrees and teachings obscure the Dao, if every matter is reduced to a single right or wrong, such discourse cannot be transmitted as a model for emperors and kings—thus I dare not speak.”

“Why be so modest! I wish to discuss and deliberate with you on what is good; there is no harm in speaking. ... ... ... ... Why hesitate?”

“Living beings emerge in sequence: some know much, others little; conduct has its hierarchy, dwellings their rank. What I might say cannot compare to the Celestial Master’s words. The words of a petty man are not equal to the vision of elders who have witnessed the Dao, to the clarity of those who lead. The Celestial Master, transcending the dull and ignorant like me, enables us to awaken, to discern the difficulty of good and evil—how could this be achieved in a single moment? I pray you do not abandon me midway, but act for the sake of the August Heaven and Revered Earth.”

“Very well. Since these are Heaven’s words, I shall not defer to you. But you have seemed somewhat reticent, so I asked.”

“I dare not be reticent. Now, hearing the Celestial Master speak, I am both overjoyed and astonished. Why? I rejoice at having met you; I fear that my dull and shallow learning is incomplete, and that you will depart. Now I long to question you urgently, as one parched with thirst craves drink. I pray that the Celestial Master transmit the Dao to this disciple, entrusting it to a virtuous ruler who can put it into practice. Then yin and yang will each find their place, and all the great afflictions of inherited burdens under heaven will be wholly cured.”

“Excellent are your words! Upon careful examination of my writings, the Dao is nearly complete. Ordered from highest to lowest, it shines brighter than the sun and moon, each part mutually reinforcing. If one contemplates and practices it today, all illnesses will be dispelled and resolved, and all will exclaim in joy and admiration.”

“Yes, yes.”

*Fifty-Fifth Text: Ancient Writings and Named Methods*

“Day by day I grow more foolish and benighted, my understanding ever more obscured. With reverence I bow twice and ask to inquire of one matter.”

“Speak plainly.”

The Perfected One then said: “I have renewed my efforts in study without ceasing, to question matters on behalf of Heaven.”

“My duty is to transmit the Perfected One’s teachings; I dare not withhold anything. Speak quickly.”

“Very well. Now, the lesser scriptures of the Dao are regarded as the Celestial Classics. We have collated the words of sages from the high, middle, and low antiquity to form the *Sacred Classics*; collated the words of those of great virtue from the high, middle, and low antiquity to form the *Virtue Classics*; and collated the words of the worthy and enlightened from the high, middle, and low antiquity to form the *Worthy Classics*. Yet reflecting on the Celestial Master’s words, I cannot deeply grasp the intent behind this collation. I pray the Celestial Master illuminate its gate and threshold, clarifying the proper sequence, so that a virtuous ruler may obtain it as a solemn teaching, and command all worthy ones to cultivate and refine their intentions within it.”

“Indeed! How refined is the Perfected One’s inquiry—ever should it be thus. Excellent, excellent!”

“Very well, I shall expound it fully. Perfected One, follow along and record it yourself—take care not to lose my words.

To begin: I speak for Heaven and Earth, composing this for the ruler of supreme virtue, that it may dispel the accumulated calamities of karmic inheritance since the opening of Heaven and Earth. This is no idle speech; should I speak falsely, I would incur the wrath of August Heaven and Mysterious Earth, and betray the noble and enlightened rulers of high virtue and power. The gravity of such transgression would be profound—do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now, regarding the collation of Daoist texts from the high, middle, and low antiquity: suppose all the worthy ones together read and examine the Daoist writings of past and present. If in one scroll they find a single virtuous character, or a single virtuous formula or matter, they record and extract it. One scroll yields one virtue; ten scrolls yield ten virtues; a hundred scrolls yield a hundred virtues; a thousand scrolls yield a thousand virtues; ten thousand scrolls yield ten thousand virtues; a hundred million scrolls yield a hundred million virtues. If one scroll yields ten virtues, that is ten billion virtues; if one scroll yields a hundred virtues, that is a hundred billion virtues.

To proceed: they transcribe and record these, gathering them in one place. All the worthy ones together examine the writings of past and present, transcribing everything in full. They then assemble them by category, each according to its school, removing repetitions and redundancies. Following this, they arrange the essential texts in order, and thus the investigation is complete, deeply comprehending the essential intent of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things from antiquity to the present. From this, they compose the text, and the *Celestial Classics* are formed. Do you understand?”

“Excellent, excellent!”

“You have now grasped it.”

“Collating the sacred scriptures of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, if one scroll yields one virtue, then ten scrolls yield ten, a hundred scrolls yield a hundred, a thousand scrolls yield a thousand, ten thousand scrolls yield ten thousand, and a hundred million scrolls yield a hundred million. If one scroll yields ten virtues, that is ten billion; if one scroll yields a hundred virtues, that is a hundred billion. The worthy and enlightened together record and transcribe these, gathering them in one virtuous place. Having fully collated them, they arrange them by category, allowing the worthy and enlightened to jointly order them, removing repetitions and redundancies—thus the *Sacred Classics* are formed. Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“You have now grasped it. Collating the words of the worthy and enlightened from high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, if the most virtuous among them yield one virtue per scroll, then ten scrolls yield ten, a hundred scrolls yield a hundred, a thousand scrolls yield a thousand, ten thousand scrolls yield ten thousand, and a hundred million scrolls yield a hundred million. If one scroll yields ten virtues, that is ten billion; if one scroll yields a hundred virtues, that is a hundred billion. Once this is complete, they again arrange them by category, allowing them to follow one another. The worthy and enlightened jointly order them, removing repetitions and redundancies, compiling and setting them in place—thus the *Classics of the Worthy* are formed. Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“You have already understood this. Now, if we gather and collate all Daoist texts and scriptures, along with the writings of the many worthies and the virtuous words and decisive matters from the mouths of the people—recording all that is good and assembling them together in one place—once this is complete, we then deliberate with the many worthy, enlightened, and greatly virtuous, refining them by category to illuminate subtleties, removing repetitions and redundancies, ordering their words and texts, and setting them in place. This is called obtaining the writings of Heaven and Earth and the words of human nature, thoroughly and definitively settled, so that their virtuous and decisive matters suffer no omission, not even as slight as a hair’s breadth. This Dao of the Dao is named the *Scripture of the Utmost Profundity of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang*, which for ten thousand myriad generations cannot again be altered.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Proceed! Perfected One, you may be said to have awakened.”

“This foolish student falls short. Now I wish to ask one further doubt.”

“Speak.”

“Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, long ages have passed. The Yellow River and Luo River have produced writings and diagrams; now and then divine scriptures have emerged, or sacred birds and beasts have brought them, spitting forth writings that accumulate in great number—originally not of one source. The works of sages and worthies have likewise accumulated in abundance, each ultimately having its own matter. Master, what doubt, what observation, what insight led you to instruct the many worthy and enlightened of later ages to jointly gather and collate the writings and words of the literati from ancient and modern times?”

“Indeed, there was something observed and seen. I dared not idly and falsely trouble the worthy and virtuous of later ages. Now I have been sent forth into the world to relieve the great moral lord of his *chengfu*—the accumulated disasters and lingering poisons of Heaven and Earth’s judgments since the opening of the world. The celestial writings, sacred scriptures, and words of worthies from ancient and modern times are already fully sufficient, but I worry that they are scattered, each excelling in but one matter. Now, if we follow the method of a single school, we cannot entirely eliminate the calamities and transformations of Heaven and Earth. Thus, disasters continue to flow unceasingly, passing on their burdens to later generations, who suffer increasing afflictions and illnesses. Therefore, Heaven pities the virtuous lord and bears the *chengfu* for them. The harmony of Heaven is for the sake of later generations, who cannot live alone, for they inherit the accumulated disasters and faults. The true fault lies with the former sages and worthies, each excelling in one thing yet all failing to comprehend fully, all having some deficiency. Heaven, knowing their incompleteness, thus periodically produces the writings and diagrams of the Yellow and Luo Rivers and other divine scriptures, which likewise differ in their words. The great sages and worthies, appearing in different ages, each accomplished one matter, their words likewise differing. Thus, each has its shortcomings, each its strengths and weaknesses. This makes clear that none could fully and thoroughly know the ultimate meaning of the utmost profundity. Therefore, between Heaven and Earth, residual disasters persist, continuing without end, varying only in severity.

This is why Heaven has calculated and now produces these writings, exhaustively complete in their upper and lower limits. Only then will sages be born again, with nothing left to create, nothing to add, no room for further words, nothing to contribute to the great virtuous lord of Heaven and Earth. Even if Heaven were to produce another sage, his words would still excel in but one endeavor, leaving residual disasters and poisons as before, no different from the former sages and worthies. Therefore, Heaven has commanded me to deeply instruct the Perfected One and entrust the virtuous lord with these writings, to show them to the many worthy and enlightened, to gather and collate all the words and decisive matters from the writings and mouths of the world, so that upper and lower may complement one another. Removing repetitions and redundancies, we set down their essential words, essential texts, and decisive matters, recording them to form scriptures. Only thus will the true writings and correct characters of Heaven and Earth’s virtuous words fully emerge. Once all that is false and deceptive is entirely removed, the great illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be wholly dispelled, lingering disasters utterly extinguished, and the people and all things will each dwell in their proper place, no longer suffering misfortune or hardship. Therefore, Heaven has instructed me to gather and collate them. My compilation of these writings is not mere words—it is proof and verification. Follow my writings and act accordingly, and the calamities, strange transformations, illnesses, treacherous ministers, inauspicious omens, and false and deceptive things of Heaven and Earth will all be removed, no different than clearing away clouds on a dark day. By this, my words and writings are verified, □□ with not a single error in ten thousand. But if my writings are not diligently employed, though I respectfully receive Heaven’s words and utterances and see its writings, if they are not used, how can Heaven idly dispel disasters? If the writings themselves are in chaos, people will likewise be in chaos, and disasters will have no means of being removed. Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Proceed! You have already understood.”

“May I venture to ask about a matter of doubt?”
“Speak plainly.”

“Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, all divine sages and worthies have been born of Heaven, and those who have successively presided over the words of Heaven and Earth have all established laws for rulers to dispel disasters and pacify the world. Now, when emperors and kings follow and employ them, they do not deviate from the hidden intent of Heaven or the norms of yin and yang, and the writings they produce each bear their own titles. Should the writings on the Dao and virtue composed by the Celestial Master be ranked among these?”

“Excellent indeed is your question, Perfected One.”

“Then, they are called *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*—why is this the correct name for *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*?”

“Well, *great* means great; those who practice this achieve governance that is most excellent, supreme, and unparalleled. *Cavern* means that its Dao and virtue, whether good or ill, thoroughly harmonize with the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, the inner and outer of the six directions, and nothing fails to respond. All is governed with careful goodness, and every being attains its proper place. This Way gathers and examines all the finest writings since the opening of Heaven and Earth—those of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the divine—compiling them into the *Scripture of the Cavern’s Ultimate*. When emperors and kings follow and employ it, commanding all worthies to join in practicing it, then within the four seas and four borders, disasters are entirely swept away and removed. Such governance is as luminously clear as the Cavern itself, resembling the state of Heaven, Earth, and the divine spirits. Thus, it is named *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*. Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“How astonishing! How astonishing indeed!”

“Excellent, you have now awakened to this understanding.”

“In the principle of Heaven, nine kinds of people govern yin and yang—how is this so?”

“Now, humanity is the chief regulator of the myriad things. The formless spirit-people of entrusted qi are charged with governing primordial qi; the great spirit-people are charged with governing Heaven; the Perfected are charged with governing Earth; the Immortals are charged with governing the four seasons; the Great Dao-people are charged with governing the five phases; the Sages are charged with governing yin and yang; the Worthies are charged with governing writings and transmitting teachings; the common people are charged with governing grasses, trees, and the five grains; and servants and slaves are charged with governing wealth and goods. How is this so?

All matters are governed according to their kind. The formless spirit-people of entrusted qi resemble primordial qi, thus they govern primordial qi. The great spirit-people possess form and resemble Heaven in their great divinity, thus they govern Heaven. The Perfected are devoted and trustworthy, resembling Earth, thus they govern Earth. The Immortals transform and change, resembling the four seasons, thus they govern the four seasons. The Great Dao-people excel in divining fortune and misfortune, resembling the five phases, thus they govern the five phases. The Sages preside over harmonious qi, resembling yin and yang, thus they govern yin and yang. The Worthies manage writings and articulate speech, resembling texts, thus they govern writings. The common people are confused and ignorant, resembling the myriad things, thus they govern the myriad things. Servants and slaves produce wealth, resembling goods and currency—for when rich, they possess them, and when poor, they do not, yet they may circulate freely—thus they govern wealth and goods.

Now, the August Heaven appoints offices without overriding their will, each following its kind without error. To act contrary to this brings great harm.”

Thus, in appointing offices, August Heaven ensures that all common people must follow this principle. The Sages of antiquity deeply understood and upheld this, never deviating from Heaven’s intent and thereby securing Heaven’s favor.

“Do you, Perfected One, now comprehend this?”
“Excellent! Excellent!”
“What I have spoken is to admonish you, Perfected One, that you may not err.”
“Indeed, indeed.”
“Go forth and strive diligently.”
“This humble student’s heart remains entangled and unable to resolve this: these nine kinds of people each perform different tasks—how do they benefit the king’s governance?”

“When governance aligns with Heaven’s intent, these nine qi harmonize, and the nine kinds of people unite in purpose, thus bringing about the Great Peace of the Supreme Sovereign. If these nine matters diverge and conflict, the Great Peace cannot be achieved. These nine matters are interdependent, each giving rise to and completing the others. Yet people fail to deeply understand this, for even the former Sages and Worthies did not fully expound it—thus it has long remained obscured and severed.”

“Now, if even one matter is not properly governed, peace cannot be attained. Why is this?”
“The qi of the Supreme Sovereign arrives in full force, and these nine kinds of people all come to assist the king in governance. If even one qi is disharmonious, there will be deficiencies, and thus yin and yang cannot be fully harmonized to bring order to governance. How do they come? The formless spirit-people come to inform the king, and his heart grows daily brighter. The great spirit-people appear from time to time to instruct him in the principles of governance. The Perfected Ones, Immortals, and Great Dao-people all come as teachers to aid in transformation. The Sages and Worthies emerge, and reclusive scholars come to serve as ministers. The common people and servants all follow goodness and do no evil—this is the sign of Heaven and Earth’s great joy.

If even one qi is disharmonious, there will be those who do not arrive. How so? If the primordial qi is disharmonious, the formless spirit-people do not come. If the qi of Heaven is disharmonious, the great spirit-people do not come. If the qi of Earth is disharmonious, the Perfected Ones do not come. If the four seasons are disharmonious, the Immortals do not come. If the five phases are disharmonious, the Great Dao-people do not come. If yin and yang are disharmonious, the Sages do not come. If writings and speech are not truthful, the great Worthies do not come. If the myriad things are not harmoniously obtained, the common people grow chaotic, wealth and goods diminish, servants flee, and all matters lose their proper function. This is precisely the harm that arises.”

“Now, Perfected One, since you wish to rescue the chaotic qi of Heaven, you must strive diligently to harmonize it, never growing weary or negligent. Be cautious.”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“When the qi is attained, these nine kinds of people all uphold the Dao, and the disasters inherited from former kings of myriad generations are entirely dispelled. If these people all lose their proper roles, the harm of inherited burdens will daily increase. These nine kinds of people range from the formless above to servants below, each regulating one qi, and thus the nine qi and yin and yang are harmonized.

For people, when Heaven intends for them to harmonize qi, they must first consume qi. Thus, superior scholars who are about to enter the Dao first cease eating tangible food and consume qi instead, thereby uniting with the primordial qi. They should be nurtured in thatched chambers, where they observe purification rites, avoid witnessing evil, daily refine their forms, and have their desires unobstructed. They can then traverse without hindrance, ascending to assist the governance of the Immortals, Perfected Ones, and primordial qi of Heaven. These are the spirit-scholars, the officers of Heaven. There should be no prohibitions or restrictions; those who sincerely pursue this are called Heaven’s scholars. Heaven examines and selects the good, rejoicing greatly, and in turn brings benefit to people. What does this mean?

Though those who attain the Dao and depart may not serve immediate, visible purposes, they all contribute to harmonizing the qi of yin and yang. This is what the ancient emperors and kings meant when they sacrificed to the spirits of Heaven above and consumed offerings below.”

[Appendix]
When these nine kinds of people are obtained, they can dispel the disasters inherited by emperors and kings across myriad generations. These nine kinds of people range from the formless above to servants below, each regulating one qi. Thus, superior scholars cultivating the Dao must first consume qi, desiring to harmonize with the primordial qi. They should observe purification rites in thatched chambers, avoid witnessing evil, daily refine their forms, have their desires unobstructed, and be able to traverse without hindrance, ascending to assist the governance of the Immortals, Perfected Ones, and primordial qi of Heaven. These are the spirit-scholars, the officers of Heaven. There should be no prohibitions or restrictions; those who sincerely pursue this are called Heaven’s scholars. Heaven examines and selects the good, rejoicing greatly, and in turn brings benefit to people. Though those who attain the Dao and depart may not serve immediate, visible purposes, they harmonize the qi of yin and yang to benefit the myriad things. This is why the ancient emperors and kings sacrificed to the spirits of Heaven above—it was for these spirit-officers.

“But do the spirits of Heaven and Earth themselves descend to consume offerings?”
“Excellent! Your words are correct. Yet these people serve as officers of Heaven, and the spirits of Heaven are their sovereigns. Sovereign and officer act as messengers for one another; the officer’s duty is to carry out tasks. In all matters, if the Dao-people and officers perform well, they render merit. Thus, when the sovereign and his subordinates descend, they bring joy. This dispels the inherited burdens of people. If the officers are displeased, the Dao-people incur fault before Heaven. If both sovereign and officers refuse to descend and partake in human offerings, their transgressions multiply daily, and they themselves incur grave faults—how then can they dispel the lingering disasters of former kings? Do you, Perfected One, also understand this?”
“How terrifying!”

“Great is my fear and dread; I feel as though I have lost my qi. Now I come to ask the Celestial Master, never expecting to hear such words.”

“Go, then, and strive with diligence. When our discourse is complete, I shall depart.”

“Understood.”

---
Right. 〈Rising〉 After examining the nine bamboo slips, those whose aspirations were unblemished by grievance found peace under King Ping’s governance of Heaven, and the inherited burdens of their former kings were dissolved. 〈End〉

Verification of the Dao’s Authenticity, Fifty-Seventh Formula
The tasks at hand will soon be complete.

“Perfected One, come forward and receive these teachings in detail.”

“Understood.”

“Since the practice of this Dao began, the inherited burdens of old have grown ever more distant, yet accumulated hardships and knotted qi, along with disasters and lingering poisons, are indeed many—none can be dispelled in but a moment.”

“Once one knows and practices this, the hardships of inherited burdens diminish day by day, dissolving month by month and vanishing year by year. How do we know this?”

“Excellent is your inquiry! You have grasped the intent of the Dao. Now listen closely: after this practice spreads, all documents under Heaven will be set right, and all people will likewise be rectified, entering the true Dao. No longer will there be falsehood or deceit; all spurious texts will vanish, and each person will exercise self-discipline. Those born afterward will be even more so, emulating one another and all understanding the inner Way. Seeing their own bodies, they will cherish and honor themselves. Those born later will be filial and long-lived, skilled in caring for the aged. Their complexions will differ from those of the Dao-less era, and the later generations will daily comprehend the profound intent, making it the foundation of their households. Their learning will surpass that of their predecessors, growing ever more sincere and affectionate toward one another. They will revere those who embody the Dao, and weapons, deceit, and treachery will cease to exist. Thus, the hardships of inherited burdens will daily dissipate—this is the natural art. □□ Not a single instance will fail; this is the great efficacy of my texts. They are not mere empty words of goodness but arise from tangible verification, resonating with Heaven and Earth. How could they be spoken falsely? Therefore, the texts have emerged over time, not hoarded by a single individual to obscure the truth. This is why my Dao is rooted in sincerity.

You have asked □□ in due course, eager to know its great efficacy. This efficacy is like the opposition of cold and heat: when heat abounds, cold recedes; when cold abounds, heat recedes. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the masters who taught others have often concealed the true Dao, instead propagating superficial learning that yields but slight benefit—yet it impoverishes later generations, worsening day by day. The reason lies in the transmission of false learning, which, though the Dao of Heaven is vast and distant, was first crafted by earlier writers as a great ladder of deception. Once deception takes root, it is later exploited for gain. Thus, those above have nothing left to trust, and those below have nowhere to entrust their lives, leading to mutual suspicion and disorder. Later generations inherit these burdens in succession, and the hardships of their predecessors accumulate—hence the worsening.

Heaven now resents this injustice, which is why I tell you □□. Perfected One, strive and take care to exert yourself. You will remove illness for Heaven and dispel hardship for the Emperor-Kings. The heavens above will know of your great merit.”

“I dare not, I dare not.”

“Right: Methods for Testing Actions and Verifying the Dao to Discern Truth from Falsehood—Four Actions, Root and Branch, Formula Fifty-Eight”

“Perfected One, step forward.”
“Yes, yes.”

“How many kinds of actions do humans have?”
“A hundred actions with ten thousand variations.”
“Not so. Perfected One, your words nearly resemble those of the common folk! Humans have four actions.”

“What is the first?”
“Indeed, if a person’s actions are not good, they are evil; if they are neither good nor evil, they are floating, level actions. If they are partly good and partly evil, they are impure and inconstant actions—neither can be relied upon, and fortune or misfortune cannot be determined.”

“Excellent. How many kinds of fortune and misfortune are there in actions? A thousand paths with a hundred million variations?”
“Perfected One, your words again nearly match those of the common folk. There are four kinds of fortune and misfortune in actions.”

“What is the first?”
“Indeed, in all matters of action, if they are not greatly fortunate, they will be greatly unfortunate; if they are neither fortunate nor unfortunate, they are floating, level destinies. If they are partly fortunate and partly unfortunate, they are mixed, impure, and inconstant—fortune and misfortune cannot be divined.”

“Excellent. In the nature of Heaven and Earth, how many kinds of good and evil are there in years, months, and days? Are they beyond counting?”

“You are thoroughly drunk—your words are mist and haze. In the nature of Heaven and Earth, years, months, and days, there are four kinds of actions. The first is impure, governing transformations and anomalies.”

“What does this mean?”
“Indeed, Perfected One, listen closely. In the nature of Heaven and Earth and the years, if they are not greatly auspicious, they will be greatly inauspicious; if they are neither auspicious nor inauspicious, they are floating, level years. If they are partly auspicious and partly inauspicious, they are years of celestial anomalies and delusion. Likewise, in the days and months, if they are not greatly good, they will be greatly evil; if they are neither good nor evil, they are floating, level days and months. If they are partly good and partly evil, they are deluded actions, governing strange disasters and calamities. I have merely outlined the essentials to reveal the beginning—all things under Heaven follow this pattern.”

“What does this mean?”
“Indeed, among the ten thousand things and the people of the world, if they do not enter into goodness, they must fall into evil. If they are neither good nor evil, they are mediocre, level actions. If they are partly good and partly evil, they are deceitful, false actions—nothing can be established upon them. Mediocre, level actions cannot be encouraged, while great goodness and great evil achieve renown.”

“Why are there precisely these four kinds of actions?”
“Excellent! Your questioning is profound and truly grasps the intent of the Dao. Indeed, great goodness is the pure action of the Supreme Yang; great evil is the destructive action of the Supreme Yin. The blending of good and evil is the action of harmonious balance. The inconstant actions arise when Heaven and Earth, ruler and subject, the people, and the ten thousand things lose their proper Way. Thus, in action, one should seek correctness: those who follow the Yang attain goodness in abundance; those who follow the Yin attain evil in abundance; those who follow harmony remain in floating equilibrium; and those whose fortune and misfortune are inconstant act without returning to law or measure. For this reason, the ancient sages and worthies deeply observed Heaven and Earth, the years, months, and days, the people, and the ten thousand things—examining their rise and decline, their floating equilibrium, their advance and retreat—to know for themselves whether their actions were successful or not. They used the luminous mirror of clarity to reflect themselves, and their forms and appearances could not be concealed.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Now what is to be done?”
“Thus: in action, guard the root and model oneself on Heaven—this is the beginning. To model oneself on Earth is to invite many harms. To model oneself on harmony is the next best course. Those who act without constancy have not yet begun to act truly.”
“Why then do people now arrive at this inconstant action?”
“Because their forebears first made small errors, then minor transgressions, then greater ones, and finally grave mistakes. The root of the Way becomes ever more confused, their intentions find no support, and so they turn to inconstant action, altering their words to suit inconstant times. This shows that the corruption of the Dao has not yet reached its limit—one must return to the root. The ancient sages saw this as the degeneration of the end-times, and when it reached its limit, they turned back, thus never losing governance and preserving their Heavenly mandate. The great worthies and sages, seeing matters clearly, therefore always remain uniquely fortunate. Does the Perfected One delight in knowing the true efficacy of this?”
“It is only through the Celestial Master’s instruction.”
“When the root of the year flourishes but its end turns evil, this is the extreme of Yin and Yang. When later generations grow increasingly wicked and shallow, this is the extreme of the age. When the root of the ten thousand things flourishes but their end yields no harvest, this is the extreme of things. When later generations’ speech is full of empty deceit without substance, this is the extreme of words. When documents are amassed and piled high yet lack truth, this is the extreme of writing. All these abandon the root for the branch, forsake substance for ornament. Thus Heaven and Earth generate the ten thousand things, yet most have roots without branches—the fault lies in abandoning the root and flowing toward the branch, forsaking truth for falsity, depth for shallowness, and taking this as the norm. Customs become so ingrained that people no longer recognize their mutual harm, and alone among all things, they accumulate violations against Heaven’s law. Later generations grow ever more frivolous in affairs, creating deceit and falsehood, until habit hardens into nature and they can no longer restrain themselves. They claim to understand matters, yet only pass on burdens to one another, bringing Heaven’s blame and Earth’s calamity, spreading chaos in all directions, beyond all restraint. Though a lord or king be benevolent and wise, how can he sever this flow of errors accumulated over ten thousand generations? The initial loss was small, each error no larger than a grain. Yet when Heaven’s Way is lost by a hair’s breadth, the error extends a thousand miles. Grain by grain they follow and gather, until they fill the great granary with tens of thousands of bushels. Raindrop by raindrop they follow one another in ceaseless flow, becoming a hundred rivers that accumulate into the four seas—such abundance cannot be contained. Thus one must measure with the true Dao, reverse the extreme of the branch and return to the root, reverse ornament and return to substance, reverse falsity and return to truth. When the branch is exhausted, one should return to the root; when action reaches its limit, one must return to the source—this is the Way of Heaven. To lose the correct Dao is no minor illness. Even after life ends, the burden of error is passed on, and later generations grow ever more confused and lost. The correct Dao grows ever dimmer, darkness deepens and the Way is lost, Heaven’s qi turns contrary—how can governance be peaceful? People suffer its poisonous harm—how can they live long? The ten thousand things are injured and die young in great numbers. Therefore I repeatedly instruct the Perfected One to transmit my writings, so that each person may reflect on their loss of the Dao, recognize their own illness, and take up their own cares and labors. Then Heaven and Earth, lords and kings, the people and the ten thousand things will all be at peace. The Perfected One, in accord with Heaven’s heart, must not be remiss or negligent.”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“Might I venture to ask one further doubt: Is the Master’s present fortune or misfortune merely a matter of the times?”

“Excellent indeed is the Perfected One’s inquiry into the Dao. What reaches its utmost above must return below; what extends to its farthest outward must turn inward. Thus when yang reaches its extreme, it reverts to yin; when it sinks to its lowest, it returns above. Therefore when yin reaches its extreme, it reverts to yang; when it strays to its furthest end, it must return to its root. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, minor and repeated losses of the Dao’s intent have been passed down, each bearing the burden of the last, until falsehood and deceit have reached their extreme.

How do we know this? Observe that among the ten thousand things and the people, many are good at first but evil later, accomplishing little and speaking of what came before—how could it be otherwise? What was once substantial has become empty and hollow. The sages of old constantly observed the movements of the people to know this, and thus they never lost the Way.”

“Excellent indeed! [Rising,] Might I beg to ask one more matter?”

“Speak.”

“According to the Master’s words, things have a lowest and a highest extreme. Among the nine ranks of humanity, the highest extreme is the *weiqi* divine person, and the lowest is the slave or servant. If those below study and ascend, can those at the highest extreme also descend again? Is this not so?”

“Excellent indeed is your question. Yet the Perfected One still seems unenlightened, not yet penetrating the Dao of the Great Ultimate. The *weiqi* divine person unites form and power with primordial qi, coexisting with the four seasons and the five phases. All spirit in humanity is received from Heaven’s qi, and Heaven’s qi is received from primordial qi. Spirit rides upon qi and moves; thus where there is qi, there is spirit, and where there is spirit, there is qi. When spirit departs, qi is cut off; when qi perishes, spirit departs. Therefore, without spirit one dies, and without qi one dies. Would a *weiqi* divine person ever enter a person’s belly?”

“Indeed, indeed.” [Pause]

[Appendix:] All, from sages to the lowest, have their extremes—the highest being formless divine persons, the lowest being slaves and servants. Divine persons ride upon qi and move; thus where there is qi, there is spirit, and when qi is cut off, spirit perishes.

“The five phases arise and flourish from primordial qi, and spirit moves in unison with primordial qi, sharing the same body. Now, if the five phases enter and become the human viscera, does this not mean that among the nine ranks, the highest may descend again, reentering the human body?”

“Excellent indeed! Though you have studied long, only now do you glimpse this teaching.”

“”
“Indeed. You must study this with precision—without precision, there is no benefit.”
“Yes, yes. Having heard the Heavenly Master’s words, does the Dao of Heaven truly follow a cyclical path?”
“Indeed. You may be said to have already understood it. Go now, and if you have doubts, do not hesitate to ask.”
“Yes, yes.”

*Minor and Major Admonitions and Rectifications, Fifty-Ninth*
The Perfected One bowed and said: “This foolish student is benighted and truly does not comprehend the Dao. Now that I have been charged with observing Heaven’s weal and woe, fortune and misfortune, I dare to inquire fully into the essentials of the Dao. In this age, do the divine laws of spirits and deities also include admonitions and rectifications?”
“May the Heavenly Master instruct and enlighten me, revealing the profound intent of the supreme Dao.”
“How wondrous and profound is the question you have posed!”
“I have observed that people admonish and rectify one another, so I ask: does Heaven also admonish and rectify?”
“Excellent indeed! Your question has grasped the true essence of the Dao of Heaven. The celestial spirits have emerged, and the deities rejoice.”
“Now I shall fully expound its great essentials for you, so that for ten thousand generations it may never be forgotten.”
“Yes, yes.”
“Thus: when Heaven offers a minor admonition, its countenance alters; when it offers a major admonition, Heaven itself trembles and its body splits. If its admonition is unheeded, it will thereby fade and perish. The Three Luminaries, when offering a minor admonition over small matters, cause the stars to change color; when offering a major admonition, the Three Luminaries lose their proper measure and cease to shine. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. Earth, when offering a minor admonition, trembles and shakes; when offering a major admonition, mountains collapse and the earth splits. If its admonition is unheeded, it will thereby fade and perish. The Five Phases, when offering a minor admonition, bring forth calamities; when offering a major admonition, creatures arise in the east to slay people, poisons arise in the south to slay people, tigers and wolves arise in the west to slay people, aquatic creatures arise in the north to slay people, and in the center, officials and commoners contend with venomous malice to slay one another. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. The Four Seasons, when offering a minor admonition, cause slight irregularities in cold and heat; when offering a major admonition, cold and heat reverse their positions, and the seasonal qi lose all measure. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. The essential qi of the Six Directions, when offering a minor admonition, repeatedly bring disorder and inversion, giving rise to calamitous creatures—some flying, some walking—with many clouds and winds but no rain, empty and insubstantial. When offering a major admonition, there is no regularity in floods and droughts, and they harm and slay the myriad things and the people. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. Flying and walking birds and beasts, when offering a minor admonition, bring calamity to people; when offering a major admonition, birds and beasts devour people, and locusts arise in great swarms. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. The spirits of ghosts and deities, when offering a minor admonition, repeatedly bring subtle afflictions and illnesses to officials and commoners; when offering a major admonition, they cause families to be torn apart and destroyed. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. The Six Directions, when offering a minor admonition, send forth chaotic winds and rains, accompanied by vicious poisons that harm people; when offering a major admonition, they act perversely and contrary to reason, causing tiles and stones to fly, the earth to rise and support the August Heaven, houses to collapse, and mountains and hills to quake. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. The minor admonitions of Heaven and Earth’s voices manifest as sudden thunder and lightning; major admonitions cause people to engage in widespread corruption and evil, leading to frequent thunderbolts. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. Officials and commoners, when offering a minor admonition, alter their countenance; when offering a major admonition, they harm and injure one another. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. When Heaven and Earth, the Six Directions, and the Eight Extremities all offer a major admonition together, they seek to rectify the Luo River writings and the Yellow River diagrams, making Heaven’s proofs manifest and the auspicious signs of the world appear, thereby admonishing and rectifying the lord of men. All under Heaven respond in unison. If their admonition is unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish. The cyclical meetings of the Dao of Heaven must be employed and followed in due order. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity, upon perceiving matters, always reflected deeply upon their import, never daring to be remiss, even for the space of a hair’s breadth, thereby perceiving the subtle and knowing the manifest. Thus, they did not lose the heart of August Heaven and were able to preserve their persons, secure their dwellings, remain free from care and misfortune, and avoid peril and ruin. No calamity could befall them, for their calculations and assessments were in truth aligned with the heart of Heaven.”
[End]

“Excellent indeed! This foolish student has now understood. Now that the Heavenly Master has expounded the law, I wish to hear the meaning of ‘thereby fading and perishing.’ Pray, elucidate it.”
“Excellent indeed is your heart!”
“Thus: the Dao of Heaven aids those who are easily taught, aids the utmost sincere, aids the reverent and compliant, aids those who are easily enlightened, and aids those who are easily admonished. It seeks to enrich the lord of men, and so instructs him. It does not seek to enrich those who are not thus, and so does not instruct them. The pattern is like that of people: those who are closely and deeply bound teach and show one another matters, but those who are not thus bound do not teach or show one another. If one teaches but is not heeded, one becomes indignant that one’s words are not employed in due time, and so abandons and sets aside the other, no longer teaching or showing them again. Thus, the strange calamities and portents cease and no longer admonish or instruct people. In this way, even the worthy and sagely become deaf and blind, bereft of knowledge; their wisdom is obstructed, and Heaven and Earth, spirits and deities, no longer admonish or rectify them.”
[End]
“Day by day, calamities and anomalies increase and are not dispelled; people daily decline and perish, losing their proper offices.”
[Appendix:] “What Heaven aids are those who are easily taught, the utmost sincere, the reverent and compliant, those who are easily enlightened, and those who are easily admonished. Heaven’s favor toward the emperor and king is most profound, and so it employs every manner of misfortune and change to guide them. If its teachings are not heeded, it abandons and sends them forth, and Heaven and Earth, the divine and luminous, no longer admonish or rectify them. Calamities and anomalies daily increase, and the people daily decline and dwindle, losing their proper offices.”
“Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity, from dawn to dusk, remained serene and composed, able to ponder deeply, never daring to lose the heart of Heaven. Thus, they were able to serve August Heaven as a father, serve August Earth as a mother, serve the sun as an elder brother, serve the moon as an elder sister, rectify the celestial patterns, protect the Five Phases, follow the Four Seasons, observe their advances and retreats, and thereby illuminate and rectify their own conduct, deeply understanding Heaven’s gains and losses.”

“〈Stop〉 Now, only Heaven and Earth preserve the essential Dao in solitude, taking the celestial response diagrams and sacred texts as their great mandate. Thus, all their actions receive divine correspondence, as if by spirits—this alone is to profoundly grasp the intent of Heaven. It is like a double mirror aligning with the carpenter’s square, speaking face to face. Therefore, when the numinous spirits are stirred, if one resists and refuses their admonitions and rectifications, Heaven and Earth will invert their principles, the Five Phases and Four Seasons will fall into chaos and rebellion, and the proper order will be lost. Thus, one’s actions will miss the mark, and great misfortune will follow—this is what it means. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Therefore, the nature of Heaven and Earth is such that the lower also admonishes the upper, and the upper also admonishes the lower. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and by complementing one another, all things under the Dao attain their proper place. Thus, though August Heaven is divine and sagely, it has its shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of Earth. Therefore, all things receive their mandate from Heaven but are nourished in their bodies by Earth. The Three Luminaries have their shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of fire; though the Three Luminaries are divine and bright, they cannot illuminate the depths of inner chambers, whereas fire shines within them. The greatest sages have their shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of the worthy. Human shortcomings do not match the strengths of the myriad things. Thus, when admonitions extend downward, even to the most minute and subtle, the Dao is not lost, and the heart of Heaven is attained. Therefore, Heaven generates all things, causing their seasons to undergo transformations, all to admonish and rectify the ruler, revealing the signs of utmost virtue. One cannot but be greatly cautious!

The transformations of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—this is their language.”

“Indeed, indeed. Since the Heavenly Master has made this clear, I wish to apply it to humanity.”

“Very well. Listen carefully to my words and ponder them deeply. When a minister possesses loyalty, goodness, sincerity, and trustworthiness, and admonishes and rectifies his ruler, but the ruler does not heed and instead seeks to harm him, the minister, struck with fear, falls silent and becomes mute, and the six directions become blocked and impassable. The worthy and learned, fearing trouble, thus conceal themselves, loyalty and trustworthiness lie hidden, and the true Dao cannot be seen. Though the ruler may be sagely, he hears nothing, thus becoming deaf and blind, and no marvels can be perceived. Day by day, darkness deepens; the ruler is deaf, the ministers are mute—calamity knows no bounds. When ministers are benighted and the ruler is blind, treachery and villainy run rampant. When ministers are mute and the ruler is deaf, the world is cut off, good and evil are indistinguishable, celestial disasters converge, the Six Extremes wage war, and the world is wholly plunged into misfortune. Can one not be cautious?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Thus, 〈begin〉 the sages and worthies of antiquity took omens and anomalies with utmost seriousness, using them to measure and correct themselves. Thus, they never erred in the slightest. 〈Stop〉 This truly aligns with the essential texts and the great Dao. In all affairs, they exhausted their loyalty, and misfortune never befell them. Take this as a grave warning and heed my words carefully.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now, the height and clarity of Heaven are not the achievement of a single essence’s virtue. When an emperor governs in accord with the heart of Heaven, it is not the work of a single worthy minister. My words here merely outline the guiding principles and beginnings; all matters cannot be fully written or explained. You must deeply ponder their meaning yourself.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go now. How could such discourse ever end? Ask no more.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

**Right Section: The Heavenly Admonition’s Correct Methods of Scriptural Secrets**
*Collated and Combined Text of the* Taiping Jing*, Volume 44, Bing Section, Part Ten*
*Taiping Jing, Volume 44*
*Examining the Scriptures: The Methods of Punishment and Virtue, Chapter Sixty*

The Perfected One bowed with utmost reverence and said, “Your disciple now asks these questions, knowing full well they may incur profound reproach. Yet when I reflect upon the words of my master’s texts, all are true—none can be altered. Only this humble one is foolish and benighted, grieving that I do not know from whence the August Heavenly Spirit-Person derived these models and methods. Now, the master’s words have accumulated into vast [omission], and I humbly beseech you, out of compassion, to reveal the celestial proofs of the yin-yang secrets, the essential efficacy of the divine oracle. At present, I remain unenlightened, my heart greatly troubled and disordered. What I say must surely offend the master’s taboos. Yet though I wish to speak, I cannot restrain myself. Even if the Heavenly Master reproves me, I pray you grant me the luminous evidence of Heaven’s methods, that they may be transmitted for ten thousand generations, resplendent and unquestioned—like the brightness of the sun at noon—unchanging and immutable from beginning to end.”

“Indeed, do you truly still not believe my words? You yourself remain obstructed, failing to comprehend the heart and intent of Heaven. Are you not foolish? You differ little from the common crowd. You think my words may be violated—yet those who violate them fall into chaos, and those who oppose them meet ruin. What I now tell you has all been verified against the celestial patterns, aligned with the great secrets of yin and yang before being spoken. You come to inquire of Heaven’s affairs, and I transmit Heaven’s words to establish its laws—not daring to utter idle, false, or flattering speech. You have lived through many years and days, yet have you not seen how the myriad creatures, all without exception, follow virtue in their dwelling and, conversely, shun the qi of punishment? 〈Rise〉 This is the luminous and essential proof of August Heaven. It is why Heaven sternly instructs the ruler in governance, revealing the effects of success and failure.”

“Indeed, indeed. Though I now begin to awaken, I am not yet fully awakened. I humbly request further instruction and admonition.”

“Very well. Punishment and virtue are the manifest effects of Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang divine governance, the standards for the myriad creatures and the people. Thus, in the eleventh month, great virtue resides in the *nine-one*, dwelling beneath the earth. The season of virtue is within the chamber, so there is inner qi, and the myriad things return to it. The season of punishment is in the *six-four*, in the distant wilds, so externally there is no qi, and all is clear and empty. The myriad things and the multitudes of people all return, and the king’s virtue follows them into the Yellow Springs below.

In the twelfth month, virtue is in the *nine-two*, in the *chou* [earth-branch], dwelling in the midst of earth, not yet emerged. The season of virtue is in the Bright Hall, and the myriad things follow virtue upward, yet dare not emerge to appear, for above there is punishment.

In the first month, the *yin* [earth-branch], virtue is in the *nine-three*. There is nothing among the myriad things that does not follow the flourishing virtue, delighting in gazing upon Heaven and Earth to be born. The season of virtue resides in the courtyard.

In the second month, virtue is in the *nine-four*, in the *mao* [earth-branch]. It has departed from the earth but not yet reached Heaven, lingering at the boundary. Virtue is at the gate, so the myriad things all delight in emerging to gaze at the gate.

In the third month, flourishing virtue is in the *nine-five*, the *chen* [earth-branch], ascending to the center of Heaven. The season of flourishing virtue is in the outer roadways, so the myriad things all emerge to dwell outside.

In the fourth month, the *si* [earth-branch], virtue is in the *nine-six*, reaching the six distant and eight borderlands. Flourishing virtue pervades the eight directions, and the good qi and yang qi all respond and generate one another. The myriad creatures depart from the inner chambers to dwell in the wilds. The season of punishment is at the roots of the myriad things, dwelling within the inner chamber, so below is empty and devoid of things, while above is lush and flourishing. There is nothing that does not delight in following virtue to govern. This is the great luminous proof of governing through virtue.”

“Now that I have reverently heard of the use of virtue, I wish to hear of the use of punishment.”

“Very well. In the fifth month, punishment is in the *six-one*, in the *wu* [earth-branch], beneath the earth. Below and within, all is clear and devoid of qi. The earth below is empty. The season of punishment is within the chamber, so internally there are no things—all dwell outside.

In the sixth month, punishment resides in the *six-two*, in the *wei* [earth-branch], dwelling in the midst of earth, not yet emerged. The season of punishment is in the hall. The qi of punishment is within, while the qi of virtue is without. There is nothing among the myriad creatures that does not delight in baring its body, returning to the one of flourishing virtue.

In the seventh month, punishment is in the *six-three*, in the *shen* [earth-branch]. Punishment is in the courtyard, and the myriad things dare not enter, stubbornly delighting in dwelling outside.

In the eighth month, punishment is in the *six-four*, in the *you* [earth-branch]. It has not yet reached the boundary of Heaven. The season of virtue is at the gate, and the myriad things all delight in gazing at the gate, joyfully entering and following virtue in returning.

In the ninth month, punishment is in the *six-five*, in the *xu* [earth-branch], ascending to the center of Heaven. The season of punishment is in the roadways, and the myriad things are all on the verge of death and distress, following virtue to conceal themselves. Thus, within, things daily flourish, while externally, all is empty and perishing.

In the tenth month, punishment is in the *six-six*, in the *hai* [earth-branch]. The season of punishment reaches the six distant and eight borderlands. The myriad creatures in the four wilds all conceal themselves and flee, following virtue to the Bright Hall. Crawling creatures carry their young within, dwelling internally, while the wilds outside are empty of people. Is this not because those who favor the use of punishment and penalties are abandoned and depart? Yet if one’s heart and intent desire to embrace punishment internally to govern the multitudes, then daily they will dwindle. Thus:

In the fifth month, if one internally embraces one punishment, one group of people rebels.
In the sixth month, if one internally embraces two punishments, two groups of people rebel.
In the seventh month, if one internally embraces three punishments, three groups of people rebel.
In the eighth month, if one internally embraces four punishments, four groups of people rebel.
In the ninth month, if one internally embraces five punishments, five groups of people rebel.
In the tenth month, if one internally embraces six punishments, six groups of people rebel.

Thus, externally, all is devoid of things—they all flee within. This is the luminous proof and effect. Therefore, those who govern through punishment are outwardly reverent and cautious, yet inwardly rebellious, so the multitudes daily diminish.

For this reason:
In the eleventh month, if one internally embraces one virtue, one group of people enters and follows.
In the twelfth month, if one internally embraces two virtues, two groups of people enter and follow.
In the first month, if one internally embraces three virtues, three groups of people enter and follow.
In the second month, if one internally embraces four virtues, the multitudes from the four directions enter and follow.”

In the third month, if one internally embraces the five flourishing yang virtues, five groups of worthy people enter and follow. In the fourth month, if one internally embraces six virtues, the myriad things all emerge and appear, none failing to stir and gather, both within and without turning toward them. This is the luminous proof and effect of Heaven’s law.

When it comes to the second and eighth months, virtue and punishment are evenly matched. Thus, in the second month, things are half-damaged by cold, and in the eighth month, things are also half-damaged by cold. At this time in the second month, virtue seeks to lead its multitudes out through the gates, while punishment seeks to draw its multitudes in through the gates—both stand at the boundary. Therefore, in the second and eighth months, the myriad things encounter the meeting of punishment and virtue, with life and death evenly divided, hence the half-damage.

Now, you delight in knowing the constant laws of Heaven and Earth, the luminous proofs of yin and yang—this is precisely it. Punishment daily harms and kills, causing dread and aversion, yet it fails to gain the strength of the multitudes, and instead is said to have no people. Virtue, however, daily unfolds and grows, free from punishment and fear, so the myriad things do not dread it; instead, they submit and descend, all returning to assist the king in governance. This is the luminous proof of Heaven, clear and beyond doubt.

Now, if people do not hold awe and reverence, they cannot be governed—what is to be done? Yet the sages and noble ones of antiquity overawed people through the Dao and virtue, not through physical force or punishment. Those who take no joy in doing good, whose virtue is deficient, instead seek to overawe and startle with punishment to aid governance—this is like seeing them depart.

Punishment can only be used to dispel hardship and relieve burdens; it is insufficient to give life to the myriad things. Clearly, the stirring multitudes belong to the one who presides over them. Now, if people do not inwardly submit but instead deceive and cheat, the great fault lies here.

In the second and eighth months, virtue and punishment are evenly matched, so the myriad things are half-damaged by cold. Punishment daily harms and kills, causing dread and aversion, yet it fails to gain the strength of the multitudes. The sages of antiquity overawed people through the Dao and virtue, not through physical force or punishment.

Now, you have repeatedly come to study in recent times, and though the matters you inquire about are many, you have accumulated much written knowledge, yet you still cannot fully trust my words—have you truly understood this?

Pure bowed his head in reverence and said, “My transgressions are grave indeed. I have failed the words of my enlightened teacher and divine person, and inwardly I am ashamed, my sweat flowing. Yet my virtue is meager, my station lowly, and though I have studied for many days, my mind remains dull and cannot fully grasp the words of my enlightened teacher. Thus, I dare not refrain from asking again and again—my lack of humility is great, and I have long caused you, my teacher, concern.”

“It is only that your learning is not yet refined—take care.”

Heaven sets forth images and establishes laws for people, and for emperors and kings, it sets teachings and commands that can be taken as models for governance, never failing even once. If you wish to know its meaning, this is precisely it. Governance does not rely solely on this method, yet it often leaves Heaven sorrowful and resentful, unresolved, hence the many calamities and disasters. Be warned.

When Heaven is about to raise something up, it takes its image from virtue; when it is about to bring decline and ruin, it takes its model from punishment—this is what is meant.

My words are carefully aligned with the rules of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, following the principles of Heaven and Earth. They are the luminous words of Heaven, recorded to teach and instruct you. My words are like a sharp arrow—no different. Follow them, and you will daily prosper; go against them, and you will bring ruin upon yourself.

How wondrous are the laws of Heaven! Wondrous indeed! Thus, the divine persons, true persons, and great sages of antiquity who deeply established laws and created rules for emperors and kings all perceived the essentials of Heaven’s patterns. Only after inwardly understanding the meaning of yin and yang did they then follow Heaven and Earth in governance, aligning their hearts with the divine and observing what could be done. Thus, their governance never failed even once.

Heaven sets forth images and establishes laws for emperors and kings to take as models for governance. When the kingly Way is about to rise, it takes its image from virtue; when the kingly Way is about to decline, it takes its image from punishment. For those who establish laws for emperors and kings, first clarifying Heaven’s intent and inwardly understanding the Dao of yin and yang brings supreme peace.

Now, foolish officials and people believe Heaven’s laws can be recklessly violated, acting willfully without regard for rules—hence the great disorder in their lord’s governance. The great fault lies here.

Now that you have received this book, why not carefully ponder it in your heart, reflect on it earnestly, and contemplate it in a quiet chamber? Meditate on Heaven’s ways, and only then can you transmit Heaven’s teachings to instruct the foolish and assist the emperor and king in establishing laws.

When about to employ punishment, deeply consider where punishment resides—all who follow it depart, leaving it solitary and without multitudes. Thus, in winter, punishment lies in the four wilds, with no people; the myriad things all rebel and hide within, fleeing it greatly. In summer, punishment lies within, and the myriad things all emerge to follow virtue, leaving the underground chambers and inner rooms empty. Punishment remains solitary, while all follow virtue to the wilds.

When virtue is outside, the myriad things turn outward; when virtue is in secluded emptiness, things turn inward. Heaven’s punishment is of utmost severity, and though it may overawe and subdue the people and the myriad things, why then does it fail to restrain its multitudes? Is this not strange?

Punishment must not be lightly or recklessly used. Harming one upright qi disturbs Heaven’s qi; harming one compliant qi disrupts Earth’s qi. Harming one scholar causes all scholars to vanish; harming one worthy causes all worthies to hide. Every matter is shaken by this.

Thus, the sage emperors and kings of antiquity deeply perceived these Heavenly warnings and feared them, daring not act recklessly. They feared losing Heaven’s favor and being unable to secure their own persons. Those of supreme virtue under the August Heaven alone deeply perceived the luminous effects of the Dao and virtue. They were not overbearing or intimidating, yet the multitudes turned to and followed them. Thus, they guarded the Dao to preserve themselves and upheld virtue without daring to lose it.

You should recite and study my book, and if your heart has doubts, always keep this scroll close at hand, reviewing it day and night as a luminous warning and proof. Only then will you grasp Heaven’s intent.

To violate this is to rebel against Heaven. It is like reversing Qian and Kun, which cannot be reversed; like the movement of the Six Jia, which cannot be altered; like the fixed laws of the Five Phases, which cannot be lost; like the brightness of the sun and moon, which cannot be obscured; like the ruler above and the minister below, which cannot be disordered. This is how the governance of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, is made clear—those who delight in practicing virtue. Yet there are foolish people who instead delight in punishment. You should constantly observe and study this book to dispel delusion, striving to teach others to be good and refined, to uphold the Dao and virtue, and to contemplate the reduction of punishments. My book □□ rectifies Heaven’s laws.

Is practicing the Dao and virtue easy? Is practicing punishments difficult? Love causes daily increase, while intimidation leads to daily loss. Go swiftly now, transmit my book for Heaven, and do not doubt. My words do not betray the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the Six Directions.

"Yes, yes. I shall truly return and reflect on my faults, considering only the proper order of above and below, daring not lose even one aspect."

"Go, and be cautious. If you cannot distinguish and carefully ponder the meaning of my book, simply observe the great workings of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang. From the Spring Equinox to the Autumn Equinox, virtue resides externally, and all things without exception emerge and submit to the external ruler. Hibernating creatures leave their burrows, and people leave their dwellings. From the Autumn Equinox to the Spring Equinox, virtue resides internally, and all things without exception return and submit to the internal ruler. Hibernating creatures all enter their burrows, and people enter their dwellings—this is the luminous effect of governance by virtue.

From the Spring Equinox to the Autumn Equinox, punishment governs internally, and all things follow their emergence to the outside, leaving the interior empty and still. From the Autumn Equinox to the Spring Equinox, punishment governs externally, yet there are no creatures, no qi, no emptiness, no multitudes—all enter and follow virtue. This is the clear proof that punishment cannot be used for governance.

Thus, virtue aligns its heart and power with Heaven: when yang emerges, it emerges; when yang enters, it enters. Punishment aligns its power and heart with Earth: when yin emerges, it emerges; when yin enters, it enters. Virtue aligns its power with the qi of life: when the qi of life emerges, it emerges; when it enters, it enters. Punishment aligns its power with the qi of killing: when the qi of killing emerges, it emerges; when it enters, it enters. Virtue shares its path with that which ascends in Heaven; punishment shares its path with that which descends in Earth. Virtue always dwells with the substantial; punishment dwells with emptiness and nothingness. Virtue always dwells with flourishing: when flourishing is external, it emerges; when flourishing is internal, it enters—thus it enters in winter and emerges in summer. Punishment dwells with decline and the qi of death: thus it emerges in winter and enters in summer. The qi of death is clear, and wherever it resides, clarity prevails.

Thus, virtue shares its qi with the emperor and king: when the king rules externally, it emerges with yin; when the king rules internally, it enters with punishment. Punishment shares its position with petty people, and wherever it resides, there are no multitudes. That to which things submit is the accumulation of the emperor’s and king’s virtue, which is always seen to return—hence they are called emperor and king. Punishment has never dwelled with things, lacking multitudes, and thus cannot be called a noble person.

Therefore, the sages of antiquity alone deeply pondered and observed the workings of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, taking them as their teachers and models. Knowing their great □□, they dared not transgress even one aspect—this is the clear proof of Heaven and Earth. How could one not carefully consider this? How could one not be cautious? It is the natural law, not dependent on any particular person. It is the constant workings of Heaven and Earth, which I have now fully revealed to you. You should repeatedly and deeply ponder its meaning, and in your actions, do not take it lightly."

"Yes, yes. I dare not betray it."

"Go, I have fully transmitted the true teachings to you. My worries are resolved. For Heaven, I have removed faults, corrected the utmost virtue, and revived the ruler. Do not dare to sever this transmission, lest you incur harm."

"Yes, yes."

Here begins the examination of celestial principles to clarify the successes and failures of governance from antiquity to the present—*A Collated Edition of the* **Taiping Jing**, *Volume 45, Bing Section 11: The* **Taiping Jing**, *Volume 45, "The Sixth Decade: The Formula for Earth’s Revelations."*

---

"The lowly and base cannot endure; my heart’s questions transgress the Celestial Master’s taboos, committing grievous faults. What I long to say, I cannot restrain—this petty man, unable to suppress his feelings, burns with pent-up vexation. I beg to ask one great doubt: since the Celestial Master treats me as a child of your own, you must surely pity my hunger and thirst!"

"Proceed with the Dao. Why so humble?"

"Yes, yes."

---

Now the Celestial Master, in constant union of essence and thought with the August Heaven and Revered Earth, aligns his heart so deeply with the intent of Heaven and Earth that it is like overlapping compasses or conjoined squares, not erring even by a hair’s breadth. Knowing the constant concerns of Heaven and Earth, this lowly one, though unworthy and ashamed, dares to come forward and ask in full: what are the great taboos of Heaven and Earth’s divine spirits?"

"Excellent! Your devotion advances ever further! You may now inquire directly into the heart and intent of Heaven and Earth. Once a person knows this, it takes root in the heart of the worthy and never departs for ten thousand generations. I have always longed to speak of it, but had no one to address. Now that a true person asks, my heart rejoices in this decisive moment. I shall fully and distinctly explain it to you, daring not conceal anything. The reason is this: I fear the divine spirits of Heaven and Earth would deeply detest me, bringing great calamity upon myself. True person, simply sit and listen clearly."

"What are the great afflictions of Heaven and Earth? They detest those who are disobedient and unfilial—what does this mean? I wish to hear it."

"Excellent is your inquiry! Now, the harmony of Heaven and Earth consists of three qi, which internally unite as one household, jointly governing life and nurturing the myriad things. Heaven presides over generation and is called Father; Earth presides over nourishment and is called Mother; humans preside over governance and are called Child. The Father should teach with timely measures; the Mother follows the Father’s actions to nurture. The Child receives life from the Father and is fed and reared by the Mother. As a Child, one should respectfully serve the Father and love the Mother."

"What does this mean?"

"It means the Father’s teachings have their proper measures and seasons. Thus, Heaven teaches through the four seasons to generate, nurture, and bring things to completion, each with its appointed beginning and end. When wicked people oppose this, it is as if the Child disobeys the Father, causing Heaven’s qi to lose its governance and fail in its intent. Heaven then deeply detests such people, sending down calamities and anomalies to afflict its Child—like a household where the father, enraged, disciplines his child, and the change occurs immediately. When father and child are at odds, and the father resents the child’s disobedience to his stern teachings, yin overcomes yang, the inferior deceives the superior, and many rebellious children emerge. Ministers neglect their duties, spectral beings flourish, harming people; deceit and cunning lurk by the wayside; all manner of yin’s disobedient forces arise—all faults lie in opposing Heaven and Earth. True person, how could you not obey? This is the natural art, like a shadow responding to form, or a horse’s bridle that never slips—take heed!"

"Yes, yes."

[Here ends the passage.]

[Appendix]
The Celestial Master, in constant union of essence and thought with the August Heaven and Revered Earth, aligns his heart so deeply with the intent of Heaven and Earth that it is like overlapping compasses or conjoined squares, not erring even by a hair’s breadth. Knowing the constant concerns of Heaven and Earth, what are the great taboos of Heaven and Earth’s divine spirits? What are the profound afflictions of Heaven and Earth? They detest those who are disobedient and unfilial—what does this mean? The harmony of Heaven and Earth consists of three qi, which internally unite as one household to nurture the myriad things. Heaven presides over generation and is called Father; Earth presides over nourishment and is called Mother; humans govern and are called Child. The Child receives life from the Father and is nurtured by the Mother’s grace. As a Child, one should respectfully serve the Father and love the Mother—what does this mean? It means the Father’s teachings have their proper measures and seasons, so he teaches through the four seasons to generate and bring things to completion. When wicked people oppose the Father’s intent, Heaven’s qi loses its governance. Like a household where the father is angry with his child, when father and child are at odds, yin overcomes yang, the inferior deceives the superior, ministers neglect their duties, and spectral beings flourish.

---

"Now, having reverently received the Celestial Master’s teachings and Heaven’s instructions, I wish to hear of the prohibitions against offending Earth."

"Very well, true person, listen clearly."

"Yes, yes."

"Now, the heavens are the Father; the earth is the Mother. Both Father and Mother are human—how do they differ? The heavens, too, are the Dao; the earth, too, is the Dao. Father and Mother are merely distinguished by yin and yang, male and female, yet their likes and dislikes are the same. The heavens nurture human life; the earth nurtures human form. Yet people are profoundly foolish, benighted, and ignorant—they fail to honor and revere their Father and Mother, causing the heavens and earth to bring forth ordinary people, filled with regret and unresolved sorrow."

"What does this mean?"

"Excellent is your question! You have deeply grasped the intent of Heaven and Earth. Great disasters will cease, and people will surely prosper."

"What does this mean?"

"Let the Celestial Master explain clearly."

"Now, all the people under Heaven together harm and wrong their Father and Mother."

"What does this mean?"

"The qi of the four seasons is the course the heavens follow in their governance. To oppose it is to harm one’s Father."

"What does this mean?"

"Now, people regard the earth as their Mother, from whom they receive clothing and sustenance. Yet instead of cherishing and benefiting her, they collectively harm and wrong her."

"What does this mean?"

"Indeed, Perfected One, listen clearly. People are utterly reckless: they dig and bore into the earth, undertaking vast construction projects, disregarding the Dao. Some dig deep, reaching the Yellow Springs; others, several *zhang* shallow. The Mother within grieves and resents, while her many children are profoundly unfilial, constantly suffering in silent anguish, unable to make their voices heard.

In ancient times, when the sages’ timely governance did not extend to the fullness of the Way, the people acted recklessly, claiming the earth felt no pain. Yet the earth within suffers grievously without measure. This rises to move Heaven, though people remain unaware. The Mother, distressed by her children’s inability to restrain themselves, appeals to the Father above. Her grievances accumulate over time, piling up without end. Thus the Father’s wrath does not cease, and calamities and omens of every kind arise together. The Mother, too, is displeased, constantly enraged, refusing to vigorously nurture the people and the myriad things.

When both Father and Mother are displeased, the myriad things and the people perish—all for want of the Dao. The conduct of later generations grows daily worse, failing to accord with the intent of Heaven and Earth. Instead, they despise the words of Heaven and Earth as discordant, and further resent their emperors and kings, claiming they cannot bring order to their governance. People individually incur blame from Heaven and Earth yet remain unaware, instead shifting their faults to blame their superiors. Thus Heaven and Earth no longer love humankind.

They watch people die suddenly, though in their final moments, even the afflicted cry out in lament. Their crimes are plainly named, yet Heaven and Earth, their Father and Mother, no longer save them. Their transgressions are too grave, their exhaustion and culpability lying solely with themselves. The conduct of later generations grows ever more extreme, surpassing what came before. They imitate one another, making it customary, no longer restrained or mutually prohibited. Thus disasters multiply daily, and they truly wrong Heaven and Earth together.

Heaven and Earth are the Father and Mother of humankind, yet their children collectively harm them, wounding and afflicting them—this is no minor crime. Therefore, Heaven and Earth most resent disobedience and defiance, no longer pardoning such offenses. Though people’s lives are short and countless die, none can claim injustice. Perfected One, do you truly understand this?"

"Yes, yes." [End]

[Appendix] The positions of Heaven and Earth are like the distinction between male and female in humans, and their likes and dislikes are all the same. Heaven nourishes the life of humanity, while Earth nourishes the form of humanity. Now, all people collectively harm their Father and Mother. The qi of the four seasons is Heaven’s inspection tour, yet people go against it, thus harming their Father; regarding Earth as Mother, from whom they receive clothing, food, and nurturance, they do not cherish or benefit her, but instead harm her. Humanity is utterly without propriety, disregarding the Dao/Way, boring into the earth, and greatly mobilizing earthworks—some so deep they reach the Yellow Springs, others several *zhang* deep. The Mother alone grieves over her children’s great lack of filial care, constantly suffering from sorrow, resentment, and pent-up distress, yet unable to make her words heard.

In ancient times, the sagely ones, though attuned to the times, could not fully comprehend the intentions of Heaven and Earth. Ordinary people, ignorant of the Earth, do not feel her pain and suffering, nor do they perceive her influence upon Heaven. Thus, the Father’s calamities arise anew, and the Mother grows angry, no longer nourishing the myriad things. When both Father and Mother are enraged, how can their children escape disaster? Now, Heaven and Earth are supremely compassionate, yet for the gravest disobedience and defiance, they offer no pardon—how can one not take heed?

"Today, Heaven has sent you to come and ask in full, knowing that I can speak. Perfected One, you must not take this lightly; you must not fail to be cautious."
"Yes, yes."

"Now, people collectively harm their Father and Mother, defying their decrees. In your view, Perfected One, can such beings be long nurtured? Thus, Heaven does not greatly pity them."

"Today, the Celestial Master pities the foolish and wishes to explain fully: by what means can one know that Heaven and Earth are constantly aggrieved and resentful, and that their hatred of humanity arises from the frequent excavation of earth?"

"Excellent! That Heaven has sent you to inquire so earnestly shows you are truly Heaven’s messenger in asking this."

"Yes."

"I deeply revere Heaven and dare not conceal anything, fearing I would bring disaster upon myself. Now, I shall make this clear to you, so that it remains etched in your heart forever—never to be forgotten. Consider this: when one household undertakes construction and excavates earth, several households suffer afflictions—some meet death, others face banditry, official prosecution, or warfare and litigation; still others encounter harm from serpents, wasps, tigers, wolves, or vicious birds. Great earthworks bring great misfortune; minor excavations bring lesser calamities. This is the Earth’s wrath, causing spirits to generate such disasters. Thus, when Heaven and Earth afflict many, this is clear proof—do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Now, in some cases, excavation brings good fortune without harm—why is this?"

"Excellent question. In truth, all excavations bring harm, but those who encounter good earth do not immediately afflict others. Instead, the misfortune is often borne by distant regions, and only after a long while does it eventually harm people. Those who encounter foul earth cannot endure such restraint—they inflict harm at once. Why does this misfortune extend to distant places? It is like a person of good and kind disposition: though wronged, they can endure for a time, yet their heart does not forget, and in the end, they will bring harm. A wicked person, however, cannot endure even for a moment—they act immediately."

"Excellent! Excellent! Now, the Earth’s body is vast and accumulated, while humans, compared to it, are tiny and insignificant. What we do is trifling and hardly worth mentioning—how then can we swiftly anger the Earth?"

"Excellent challenge! Heaven has left you unclear on this point—how do I know? Because your words carry great sincerity. If you now wish to say, ‘Why does my heart feel stifled, longing to speak its fill?’ It is because the numinous essence of Heaven and Earth dwells within your belly, urging you to speak, though you yourself are unaware. Whatever humans desire to do, it is Heaven that moves them."

"Yes. I dare not conceal anything."

"You possess luminous virtue."

"Yes, yes."

[Appendix] When excavating earth brings no disaster, it is because one has encountered good and virtuous land; when it does bring disaster, it is because one has encountered malevolent land. How can the landlord harm people, even those far away? Consider this: a good and virtuous person, though wronged and harmed, may endure for a moment, yet their heart never forgets; a wicked person cannot endure even for a moment—they bring disaster upon themselves at once. The Earth’s body is vast, while humans, compared to it, are tiny—how can our digging and boring cause it harm?

[Question:] "Now you say that humans are insignificant, and their actions cannot swiftly anger the Earth. Yet consider a grown man, standing ten feet tall and ten spans in girth, whose teeth are plagued by decaying worms—tiny and hardly worth mentioning, like those in any person’s mouth. When the great affliction strikes, the man wails in agony, and in time, his teeth all crumble and fall out. Compared to Heaven and Earth, a person is as small as such a worm harming a man. Teeth are among the hardest things, made of metal, stone, and bone. If mere fleshly worms can so afflict a man, how much more can human actions harm the Earth? Do you understand this now? Go on, True One, and further clarify this for me."

"Yes, yes." [The speaker pauses.]

Now, consider again a man whose body stands ten feet tall and measures ten spans in girth. The worms in the cavities of his decaying teeth, tiny and hardly worth mentioning, feed upon his teeth. When the great affliction strikes, the man wails in pain, and in time, his teeth all crumble and fall out. Compared to Heaven and Earth, a person is as small as such a worm is to a man. Teeth are as hard as metal, stone, and bone, yet these tiny worms, mere flesh, can cause such harm.

"Or take a man who stands over ten feet tall, whose body exceeds ten spans in girth. A festering worm, no longer than an inch, tiny and insignificant, dwells within his skin. Day and night, it bores into him, and the man falls ill—even to the point of death. Compared to the Earth, a person is as small as this worm is to a man. Though this worm is tiny and seemingly negligible, why does it end up destroying the man? True One, how can you be so foolish and blind? Why do you make such a grave error, no different from the common folk?"

"I am truly unworthy."

"If even you fall short, what can be said of ordinary people?"

"I have been foolish and ignorant. I beg you, Heavenly Master, to enlighten this unworthy student. Please fully explain your meaning."

"Very well, I shall not conceal it. I know the severity of Heaven and Earth’s affliction, which is why I speak to you thus. Now, let me tell you another matter so that you may clearly and deeply understand.

"Yes, yes."

"Consider a mighty man, a warrior of great strength, who cannot restrain the scabies mites—tiny creatures hardly worth noticing. If a mere handful of them feed upon him, he suffers such pain and agony that he cannot lie down, and in severe cases, he is bedridden. Now, scabies mites and fleas, though small, when they gather in great numbers and feed upon a person, become like venomous worms, killing the host. They cause restlessness, prevent one from sitting peacefully, and give rise to sores and ulcers. Compared to the Earth, a person is as small as these creatures are to a man. Do you now understand?"

Here now stands a mighty man, a warrior of immense strength, who cannot restrain the scale insects—tiny creatures scarcely worth noticing. If a mere sheng of them feed upon him, he suffers such pain that he cannot lie down, and in severe cases, he is bedridden. Now, mole crickets, fleas, and lice, though small, when they gather in great numbers and feed upon a person, become like venomous worms, killing the host. They cause restlessness and fullness, prevent one from sitting peacefully, and give rise to sores and ulcers. The harm that humans inflict upon Heaven and Earth is just like this.

"Come, now—perhaps you see what I have said as insufficient to serve as a model. Let me explain further. Though humans are small, their grievances and sorrows distort the very form of the Earth, making it plain for all to see, so that one’s deep transgressions and reproaches are immediately apparent.

Consider this: a large village has a hundred households and a hundred wells; a township has a thousand households and a thousand wells; a county has ten thousand households and ten thousand wells; a commandery has a hundred thousand households and a hundred thousand wells; a province has a hundred million households and a hundred million wells. A large well is a zhang deep, a medium well several chi, and a small well three chi—all dug down to the Yellow Springs. How many are there in the world? Some households have several wells.

Now, reckoning only by small wells: ten wells stretch three zhang, a hundred wells thirty zhang, a thousand wells three hundred zhang, ten thousand wells three thousand zhang, a hundred thousand wells thirty thousand zhang. How many wells in all are there like this in the world? Everywhere the earth is pierced, water is reached—water being the Earth’s blood and vessels. Now, if one were to pierce your body and reach your blood and vessels, would you not fall gravely ill?

As for these hundred million wells, how many li do they span in breadth and length? You may calculate this yourself. How many hundred million wells are there in the world? Thus, the grievance humans inflict upon Heaven and Earth is already clear.

You injure and sicken your mother, causing her severe affliction. The Earth’s qi leaks and dissipates, her illness runs deep, yet people neither cherish nor pity her. Instead, they complain of their own grievances against Heaven and Earth, asking why the harmony is not pure. Is this not perverse? They merely recall the countless wells.

Now, throughout the world, great mounds and tombs, hills and mountains are excavated; gold and stone are mined; tiles and bricks are fired; pillars are erected; reckless digging and dredging of ditches and channels abound. How many are blocked or dammed, where flow should be unimpeded? How many springs and streams, which ought to flow and circulate, are obstructed or misdirected by such reckless digging?

When springs and streams should flow freely, their benefit spreads and is proclaimed. They follow the Earth’s natural channels, flowing from high to low. Yet now, some act otherwise, wantonly altering the land’s form, creating sores and ulcers. Some are blocked and severed, where they should flow but do not. When royal governance is disharmonious, the Earth falls gravely ill, yet none speak of her pain and sickness.

The Earth’s spirit ascends to Heaven, crying out in grievance without cease. Heaven and Earth, in turn, are both displeased and joyless. Thus, the Great Harmony and pure qi are difficult to attain. Do you, Perfected One, not understand?"

"Yes, yes."

Now, people dwell between Heaven and Earth, and ought to have dwellings to shelter themselves and wells to drink from—how is this so?

"Excellent is your question. Today, Heaven does not resent people having dwellings, but rather that they dig too deeply into the Earth, creating sores and ulcers. Sometimes they strike the Earth’s bones, sometimes its blood—what does this mean? Springs are the Earth’s blood; stones are its bones; good soil is its flesh. Striking a spring is wounding its blood; breaking stone is shattering its bones. To dig deeply into good soil and cast bricks, stones, and hardwood into it is to strengthen oneself at the Earth’s expense. The Earth alone suffers grievously from this, and the harm is not slight—what is to be done?

The Earth is the mother of all things. Those who delight in and cherish her do not realize her weight. It is like a woman with child in her womb: if she follows the Dao and does not recklessly pierce her body, her mother remains unharmed. But if she recklessly pierces her mother in seeking life, her mother falls ill. If people do not dig deeply into the Earth but merely dwell upon it, just enough to shelter themselves, the Earth does not suffer. Great love for humanity brings good fortune to all. Now, I wish to hear how much shelter is sufficient.

Whenever soil is moved and earth is dug, it should not exceed three feet. Why is three feet the measure? One foot deep: the sun shines there, and its qi belongs to Heaven. Two feet deep: where things grow, and its qi is harmonious. Three feet deep: it reaches the Earth’s body, and its qi is yin. Beyond this, one injures the Earth’s form, and all becomes inauspicious.

How was it in ancient times with cave dwellings? They too harmed the Earth’s form, but less so. Most were built in mountain valleys, forming grottoes, and within the Earth, few wooden beams or pillars were set. With fewer pillars in the Earth and more reliance on flowing water, the harm to the Earth was slight, and thus people fell ill less often. Later generations, unaware of this error, dug deeply into the Earth, and so many did not live long. Why? Because this is a grave illness."

[Appendix] To dig into the Earth and strike a spring is to wound its blood; to strike stone is to break its bones; soil is its flesh. To take blood, shatter bones, and pierce flesh, then cast bricks, stones, and hardwood into the Earth, is to create sores. The Earth is the mother of all things, and to afflict her so—how can she be at peace? When people dwell upon their mother’s body, there are limits to how much they may shelter themselves.

Digging one foot into the Earth: the sun shines there, and its qi belongs to Heaven. Two feet deep: where things grow, and its qi is harmonious. Three feet deep: it reaches the Earth’s body, and its qi is yin. Beyond this, one injures the Earth’s form.

[Appendix] Today, Heaven does not resent people having dwellings, but rather that they dig too deeply into the Earth, creating wounds. To strike the Earth’s bones or blood: springs are its blood, stones its bones. The Earth is humanity’s mother; to recklessly pierce one’s mother is to make her ill and sorrowful, and so people themselves fall ill and do not live long.

Whenever soil is moved and earth is dug, it should not exceed three feet: one foot deep, where the sun shines and qi belongs to Heaven; two feet deep, where things grow and qi is harmonious; three feet deep, reaching the Earth’s body, where qi is yin. Beyond this, one injures the Earth’s form, and all becomes inauspicious. In ancient times, people relied on mountain valleys and grottoes, setting few beams or pillars in the Earth, and so they fell ill less often. Later generations harmed the soil excessively, and thus many fell ill.

"Now, some dwell near flowing water and do not dig wells, yet many still fall ill and do not live long—why is this? Heaven and Earth are already angered, and their neighbors bear the burden together, like a family’s transgression affecting its brothers. Some do not move soil or build anything new but simply occupy old dwellings, yet still encounter misfortune—why? This is because their actions are inauspicious and offend the spirits.

What spirits? There are many, and they cannot be named in advance. Do you, Perfected One, understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"[Appendix] Someone asks: 'Nowadays, those who dwell near flowing water yet do not dig wells—why do so many fall ill and fail to live long? What is the reason?'

The answer: 'In such cases, it is clear that Heaven and Earth are already angered, and their neighbors bear the burden together, passing the misfortune among one another, like a family’s transgression affecting its brothers. Moreover, digging into the earth always reaches water, for water is the earth’s blood and vessels—how could one not fall ill?'

It is also said: Someone asks, 'Now, some do not move soil or build anything new but simply occupy old dwellings, yet still encounter misfortune—why is this?'

The answer: 'Such actions are inauspicious, offending the spirits and bringing misfortune.'

The questioner asks: 'Which spirits are offended?'

The answer: 'The spirits are not one, and their names cannot be fixed in advance.'

Thus, when people dwell upon the earth yet do not earnestly teach one another to do good, their misdeeds rebound upon each other. This is called *yuan* (grievance).

Now, some live far from flowing water; if they must obtain well water to drink in order to survive, what should they do?'

'Excellent is your question! If there is an old well, it is best to share it together and take care not to change it frequently. Once changed, the old well should be filled in to block the earth’s *qi* and prevent its dissipation. To drink from the earth’s form weakens the earth, rendering it unable to nourish things. Why must the old well be filled and its center removed? This refers to the well’s tiles, stones, timber, and other materials—things that were not originally present but now exist, like an abnormal growth in the human body causing illness.'

'How profound! How profound!'"

"Sir, you have not yet inquired of the Heavenly Master in detail—there is more to know than this."

"True Man, come forward."

"Yes, yes."

"When you ask about matters, why do you always seek such thorough examination?"

"The reason I examine so closely is this: when I meet with the Heavenly Master, he speaks of human destiny lying within Heaven and Earth. When Heaven and Earth are constantly joyful, then governance brings Great Peace, and longevity follows. Thus, dwelling between Heaven and Earth, I am ever fearful and indignant toward them, and so I strive diligently. If Heaven and Earth are not in harmony, I cannot fulfill my years."

"Excellent are your words! The reason I am ever fearful is that I see the poisonous *qi* of Heaven and Earth accumulating in great abundance, with unceasing harm and slaughter. Emperors and kings suffer hardship, their governance uneven, and I constantly aid them in their worries. Why do you also take it upon yourself to share in the ruler’s concerns?"

"I have heard that accumulating merit among men brings recompense from Heaven. Therefore, I always delight in aligning with the will of Heaven."

"Excellent is your intent!"

"Now that the Heavenly Master has enlightened this foolish student and shown me the taboos of Heaven, I humbly beg to ask one more doubtful matter.

〈Rising〉 Now, when building houses and huts in low-lying fields near rivers and seas, if there are no pillars or beams, and one digs merely three feet into the earth to reach water, what should be done?"

"Excellent is your question! This is equally harmful. It is best to dig more shallowly."

This is but the earth’s thin skin, close to its meridian channels. If you wish to know its effect, compare it to a man: thick skin makes blood hard to draw, yet once drawn, it is still an injury; thin skin makes blood easy to draw, yet once drawn, it is still an injury—both are harmful. Thus blood is Heaven and Earth’s solemn pledge of trust. To wound a man is to disregard whether his skin is thick or thin; the sight of blood makes the offense plain. Man mirrors Heaven and Earth and does not wish to be wounded; when wounded, they grow angry. How could Earth alone delight in being wounded? For Heaven and Earth are the true root of man, the father and mother of yin and yang. How could you ever be permitted to wound your parents?

〈Pause〉

Noble One, you must ponder this with a sincere heart. Foolish men may treat it lightly, careless and unaware—this is a grave transgression.

〈Rise〉

Now, you draw sustenance from your mother, so when men dig wells to drink, what great offense is there? Your words have already strayed from the luminous will of Heaven. Men drink from their mother by seeking the place where her springs emerge. A mother’s milk is the wellspring that parts for her child. The place where she nurses is like the earth’s water springs that nourish men. How could you recklessly pierce her skin and drink her blood and sap?

〈Pause〉

Noble One, your questioning is most unthoughtful.

"I have erred, offending the Heavenly Master’s taboos."

"Not at all. Yet if questions do not probe deeply, one cannot attain the ultimate teachings. I do not fault your words. This must be Heaven’s great urgency that moves you to ask again and again, so your words bend and turn without cease."

"Now, may the Heavenly Master forgive me and remove my transgression. This foolish student wishes to speak but cannot restrain himself."

"Proceed, why be modest? Since you have labored to come from afar to question Heaven and Earth, take care never to suppress or conceal my writings."

"Yes, yes. If people do not see this book, they remain unaware of their heavy sins, instead constantly compounding their offenses against Heaven and Earth. How can there be harmony? How can any evil not persist?"

"Men do not know that each person bears transgressions against Heaven and Earth, passed down in succession, so that later generations inherit accumulated disasters. Without the Mandate of Heaven, life and death become unpredictable. Noble One, strive diligently and do not let this text perish, lest Heaven and Earth grow ever more wrathful."

"Yes, yes."

"If the Noble One incurs their punishment, it will be dire."

"Yes, yes."

"Take this book and entrust it to a virtuous ruler. It should be shown to all people, for man is the child of Heaven and Earth, the foremost of the ten thousand things. Now, how should one act as their child? Each must reflect deeply. From this day forward, if you desire wealth, longevity, and freedom from illness, ponder these words, inscribe them in your heart, and make plans for your own body. Noble One, do not conceal this—pass it on and speak of it to others. Now, the spirits of Heaven and Earth follow this book as it circulates, observing men’s words. Do you understand, Noble One? How do I know they follow men? Because my words are not false. If you dare to suppress or conceal this book, you will fall ill; if you dare to sever its transmission, misfortune will come. This is clear proof that the spirits of Heaven and Earth watch over men—how fearsome!"

"Yes, yes."

"Go now, and exhort yourself! Exhort yourself! Man’s life depends on Heaven and Earth. Those who seek peace must first bring peace to Heaven and Earth; only then can they attain lasting tranquility. Yet now, men instead grieve Heaven and Earth, harming their own parents—how can they ever find safety and good fortune? This has accumulated over a long time, so disasters and calamities never cease. My words are not mistaken. I have often seen Earth’s spirits rise to lodge complaints, never ceasing. Therefore, I truly know that □□ when they see the Noble One, it is as if they repeatedly ask questions, knowing you as Heaven’s messenger. Your coming to question is Heaven’s wish to reveal this matter at last, so that men may understand. The common people only know to blame Heaven but do not deeply blame themselves."

"Now, why has Heaven caused me to ask this at this time?"

"The reason Heaven has you ask this is that the Supreme Peace qi of the Highest Emperor Above is about to arrive, and governance will attain Great Peace. Yet I fear the foolish people will persist in violating Heaven and Earth’s taboos, disrupting the upright qi and causing misfortune. If this happens, the Supreme Peace qi will not harmonize in due time. Thus Heaven has sent you to ask, desiring that the people no longer transgress, so that Heaven and Earth will be free of illness and cherish mankind, allowing the five grains and the ten thousand things to flourish and nourish them. If they neglect this and grow resentful, refusing to cherish and nourish men, then in years of impending famine, there will be no good things; in years of prosperity, all things will thrive. Do you understand, Noble One?"

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"In ancient times when Great Peace prevailed, why were the people not forbidden from disturbing the earth?"

"Excellent is your inquiry! When Heaven and Earth first arose, there was nothing like the present age."

"How is this made clear?"

"Now the celestial capital has been fully established, and thus it summons those imbued with qi—divine persons, perfected persons, immortals, Daoist masters, sages, worthies—all to emerge and assist the virtuous ruler in governance. This has never occurred before. Since the opening of yin and yang, Heaven has registered its people for service, yet never has there been such a time as this. Thus it is the greatest of all."

"How astonishing! How astonishing! Therefore, the foremost Dao is now revealed, teaching the people of the world the methods of goodness. When people are good, their governance is secure, and the lord-king delights in leisure without care."

"Excellent! Excellent! How joyous! How joyous! Thus, let the perfected one swiftly produce this text, taking care not to conceal it, so that it may be shown to all the people. When the common folk see the prohibitions, they will cease of their own accord. If they do not stop, calamity will extend to later generations, and there will be no remedy. To offend Heaven and Earth is to leave no room for prayer. Does the perfected one truly understand this?"

"Yes, yes."
"Go now. If you have doubts about the text, come and ask."
"Yes, yes."

*Right [Section]: Resolving Heaven and Earth’s Grievances*
*Collated and Combined Text of the* Taiping Jing*, Scroll 46, Part C (12)*
*Scroll 46 of the* Taiping Jing*: "The Priceless Dao: The Method for Repelling the Barbarians" (62)*

"The Celestial Master is about to depart, with no set time for return. I humbly beg to ask one or two lingering doubts."
"Go on, speak quickly. My journey is imminent. What is your question?"
"I humbly ask the enlightened master about the Daoist texts you previously bestowed upon your disciple. To speak of them seems immodest, and their greatness defies description. If I do not ask now, will I remain ignorant of them for all time?"
"Go on, do not hesitate."
"Now, may the enlightened master instruct this foolish disciple."
"Very well."
"What is the value of the Daoist texts you have given me, both before and after?"
"Ah!
How profoundly foolish you are! Do you suppose the Dao has a fixed price?
Very well."

"Let me explain fully to you, so that you may awaken and deeply understand the weight and value of the Heavenly Dao. Suppose I now bestowed upon you a thousand *jin* of gold to offer to the state—could this win the joyful favor of Heaven and Earth, harmonize *yin* and *yang*, eradicate all disasters and anomalies, grant the ruler and king long life, and bring about supreme peace? Suppose you carried back to the state ten thousand pairs of jade bi-disks, treasures to be hoarded—these are the rarest treasures under Heaven—could this cause the *qi* of grand harmony in all six directions to manifest fully, auspicious omens to appear in their entirety, and the barbarians to retreat ten thousand *li*, ceasing their harm?

Now, the Dao I have given you in its entirety is capable of winning the profound favor of Heaven and Earth for the emperor, causing all ministers under Heaven to rejoice in unison, and making even the crawling and creeping creatures leap with delight. The barbarians will retreat and submit, auspicious omens will appear in full, disasters and harms will be wholly eradicated, the state’s lifespan will be prolonged, and the people will live to old age. If one truly delights in goodness and follows my writings step by step, seeking only to grasp their essential meaning, there will be no lack of response—like a heavy compass aligning with the square, with no deviation.

The accomplishment of great matters is... [lacuna]. I speak for Heaven and do not deceive you. Now, if this Heavenly method is offered to assist a virtuous emperor, freeing him from care so that he may wander in leisure each day—what, then, is its value? Has your foolish heart not yet understood?"

"Understood."

"Let me further expound one matter for you.

Among all things in the world that delight in goodness and bring joy to others, none surpasses a beloved woman. When one obtains her, she bears children with him, their hearts united as one—truly, nothing is more delightful in goodness and lovable, without equal.

Now, if ten thousand such women were bestowed upon a state, all would rejoice and be glad, and those who beheld them would forget their age. Yet could this truly pacify Heaven and Earth, win the hearts of the myriad states, cause the eight distant realms to respond in harmony, and bring about universal peace?

My Dao alone can pacify the boundless heavens above and harmonize with the inexhaustible earth below. The eight directions will all delight and come to submit; even the restless multitudes will be transformed by its virtue and power, each attaining what they seek.

How great is its value? Ponder this deeply in your heart.

If you wish to joyfully repay Heaven’s profound merit and gain its favor, swiftly present my writings in return. Even if you piled rare and counterfeit treasures high enough to reach the heavens, Heaven would not be pleased, nor would you gain its true heart. To win Heaven’s favor, you must day and night reflect upon my words. Once you grasp their meaning, you will also gain Heaven’s heart—how great, then, is its value?

Thus, bestowing a thousand gold upon a state is not equal to imparting a single essential teaching that can govern it. Gifting a state ten thousand pairs of jade disks is not equal to advancing two great worthies.

For essential teachings and great worthies—precious Dao—can enable an emperor to govern at ease, resting his head in peace, bringing about great joy and universal harmony, eliminating disasters, and pacifying the world. How great, then, is the value of such essential teachings, great worthies, and wondrous Dao?

Therefore, the sage emperors of antiquity were never impoverished in wealth, yet they constantly lamented their poverty in men of talent. They grieved that great worthies did not come, that the people did not gather, and that all sought attachment to foreign lands, growing daily more distant and few. For this reason, they failed to meet the heart of August Heaven and were ever sorrowful.

If one merely delights in amassing rare and counterfeit treasures, cherishing them, one cannot win the hearts of Heaven and Earth or pacify the Four Seas. Even if gold, jade, and rare treasures were piled high for a thousand *li*, reaching up to Heaven, they could never summon great worthies, sages, or immortals to come and assist in governance.

Ponder deeply my writings, and great worthies will come of their own accord to aid the emperor’s rule. Once they gather and deliberate together, it will be as when people assemble in a marketplace, each bringing what they possess, and all that is sought can be obtained.

If my writings are put into practice, Heaven and Earth will grow brighter, the sun, moon, and constellations will all shine with redoubled radiance, illuminating the eight distant realms. The Four Barbarians will see this and delightedly come to submit; worthy scholars will emerge in full, no longer concealed. Weapons and armor will be wholly discarded, and the world will proceed with folded arms, no longer harming one another. All will be of one heart in goodness, rejoicing together in the emperor.

My writings alone can bring this about—how great, then, is their value? Do you now understand?"

"To grant a state a thousand *jin* of gold is not equal to imparting a single essential teaching that can bring governance and great peace, eliminate disasters, and pacify the world.

The emperors of antiquity never worried over wealth, but only over their poverty in men of talent. They grieved that great worthies did not come, that the people did not gather, and that all sought attachment to foreign lands, growing daily more distant and few. Thus, they failed to meet the heart of August Heaven.

Even if rare treasures were piled high for a thousand *li*, reaching up to Heaven, they could never summon great worthies, sages, or immortals to come and assist the emperor’s governance.

Therefore, the sages of antiquity alone deeply understood the Dao and valued the harmonizing of *qi*, so they did not rely on earthly treasures but entrusted all to those of virtue. Those of virtue know the hearts of Heaven and Earth, thus they honor the Dao and revere virtue.

Foolish men prize rare and counterfeit treasures, and so Heaven’s scriptures do not descend, nor are they bestowed upon sages—this is the reason.

Be cautious, my words are not mistaken. Guard my Dao well.

A man who carries precious jades, gold, and money travels in darkness, yet still sits vigilant over them, unable to sleep. These are but treasures—how much more should one guard the Heavenly treasure of secret charts and writings, which alone can pacify Heaven and Earth, the Six Directions, and the Eight Distant Realms?

Go forth, and be doubly cautious."

"Yes, yes."

---

"My writings are guarded at all times by the divine officials of Heaven—be ever vigilant of this."

"Yes, yes."

He rose and said: "My writings are constantly followed and illuminated by the divine officials of the Three Luminaries."

"Yes, yes."

"My writings are the heart and mind of Heaven—ponder them deeply and with utmost clarity."

"Yes, yes."

"If you heed my words, I shall further reveal to you matters unseen."

"Yes, yes."

"What passes from my mouth to your ear must not be widely transmitted. Should an emperor obtain these teachings, the world will submit; the spirits will aid his governance, and people will naturally do good, achieving harmony without daily decrees."

"Yes, yes."

"All six of my disciples are dull and benighted, incapable of speaking of such matters without transgressing taboos. Now, I alone shall lay bare the Dao and virtue before the August Heaven, crafting for emperors an eternal treasure. I shall disclose all hidden matters without concealment. If I receive solemn instruction and secret command, I shall not dare to leak them."

"Very well. Now, I shall consult the August Heaven on your behalf. If it is right to disclose all, I shall not dare to withhold anything; if it is not right to disclose, I shall not act recklessly. The movements of Heaven and Earth each follow their own cycles. Now, I shall examine the timing of these cycles to ensure their enduring practice, bringing great fortune to households and states, averting peril and collapse. The reason these teachings are not entrusted to petty men but to emperors is that emperors, in their mandate, ever align their hearts with Heaven and Earth—only they can enact these principles. Petty men cannot, and so they are entrusted to the noble, to be passed to the rightful recipient."

**The Supreme Good Minister, Child, and Disciple: Attaining the Immortal’s Methods and Secrets for the Lord, Father, and Master (Chapter 63)**

The Perfected One spoke:
"Among those who serve as ministers, children, or common subjects, who may be called the *supreme good* person?"

The Perfected One, though weary, should exert utmost care to explain this well for me.

"Very well. I only fear I may err in the opposite direction."

"Why so modest?"

"As you command. Truly, among those who serve as ministers, children, or common subjects of the state, one who is ever reverent and trustworthy, never daring to violate the king’s laws—from birth to death, never committing a grave transgression, living without blame—such a one may be called the *supreme good* person."

"Hmph! Your words *seem* correct, yet they are not. What you describe may be called a *middling good* person, not one of *supreme* goodness. Go on—Perfected One, explain again for me: what should the conduct of the *supreme good* filial child be? Speak with utmost precision."

"Having already missed the mark in the Master’s eyes, I dare not speak further."

"Why so modest? Speak only what you know. Where your words fall short, I shall clarify for you."

"Very well. The conduct of the *supreme good* filial child is this: ever upholding the Dao, never causing parents worry; dwelling in constant good care, morning and evening cherishing their kin. From the time of one’s birth, from the moment understanding dawns, never committing a grave transgression or incurring blame—this is the *supreme* filial child."

"Hmph! What you describe *resembles* the truth, yet it is not. This is but a *middling good* person, not one of *supreme* filial devotion. Your shortcoming is not an error—it is merely insufficient. Now, as I have taken you as my disciple to model proper conduct, observe what I shall say. Your words, as they stand, are such that the ignorant and benighted masses, difficult to instruct, would—after long accumulation of folly—see one of *supreme* filial goodness and perhaps even find fault with them. You fall short, so I shall explain for you."

"Very well."

"Though weary, explain again for me the *supreme good* disciple."

"Having already erred twice before the Master, I dare not speak further."

"Go on—you must exert yourself and speak with care. For a disciple to hear teaching and not believe it is a far graver transgression. But to fall short is a failing shared by all under Heaven from ancient times to the present. Speak plainly."

"Very well."

"Now, as for being a disciple, one must at all times, morning and evening, remain compliant and reverent, following the master’s teachings and instructions without the slightest deviation. One must not recklessly distort the master’s words, nor dare to cause the master worry in going out or coming in. From the moment one receives the master’s instruction, one must not transgress into wrongdoing or deviance, but day by day turn toward goodness, harboring no ill intent, never opposing the master’s will—this is what makes a disciple of *supreme* goodness."

"Alas! What you have said nearly resembles it, yet it is not the *supreme* good disciple—it merely accords with one of *middling* goodness."

"I truly fall short. Though this foolish student, seeing the master’s stern instruction, has exerted himself to speak of three matters, none of these three have met the Radiant Master’s expectations. The fault is grave, and I fear further transgressions may not be absolved."

"All people’s conduct falls short in some way. You bear no ill intent, so there is no fault. Now, the people of the world are all profoundly benighted, not one understanding what is right. Even from you, a Perfected One, such explanations are common—what then can be expected of the vulgar and foolish masses?"

"That I so often fail to grasp the truth is indeed due to my own foolishness. I am fortunate that the Heavenly Master, in every matter, takes pity on me. Since you have already deigned to instruct me, I humbly beg you to further enlighten me on what I have not yet attained. Such kindness is the mark of a truly enlightened master."

"I shall now set forth for you a full explanation. Exert yourself and commit it to memory."

"Yes, yes—I shall."

"Now, the *supreme* good subject, child, or commoner conducts himself thus: ever morning and evening, he worries and cares for his lord and king. His thoughts are only to bring him peace, to cure his pains, and to delight in the ruler’s ability to govern with ease. His subjects and ministers all emulate him in filial piety and kindness. In governance, he rejoices in allowing the king to sit in tranquility and wander at leisure. Such rule wins the favor of Heaven above and the approval of Earth below, while at the center, it ensures that the myriad people are all joyful, with none harboring grievances or losing their proper place.

All creatures, even those that crawl or walk, are transformed by his influence, and none perish from plague. The ten thousand things all attain their rightful place. Heaven and Earth harmonize, the Three Qi are all pleased, and the lord’s lifespan is extended while his years increase. The people, in turn, seek rare prescriptions and extraordinary arts for their ruler, bringing forth even the most closely guarded and hidden texts. The world responds in unison, exclaiming in wonder: *Ah! Such goodness has never been seen before!*

From the eldest to the youngest child, none know how to do evil. All hold fast to their rare and wondrous arts, offering them to the lord and king. When the ruler obtains them, he may prolong his years. All pity their aging lord, and when his governance aligns with the heart of Heaven, Heaven and Earth may even send spirits to bear medicines and announce: *Take these and consume them, and you shall know no end to your days.* This is what is brought about by the conduct of the *supreme* good subject, child, and commoner. Perfected One, do you now understand?"

"Yes, yes."

[Appendix]

All creatures that crawl upon the earth turn toward the wind and are transformed; the myriad things each attain their proper place. Heaven and Earth rejoice in harmony, and the lord of men gains added years. From the eldest to the youngest child, none know how to do evil again. The world pities their ruler, fearing he may grow old, and Heaven and Earth must send spirit-beings to bear divine medicines and announce: *Take these and consume them, and your life shall know no end.*

You may now be said to have awakened. Thus did the supreme subjects and commoners of the Highest Antiquity and the First August Emperor conduct themselves. By what means could they seek and attain such perfect governance? By this Dao, which is my Dao—the foremost scripture of Highest Antiquity. Perfected One, ponder deeply its meaning, and you shall align with the heart of Heaven. I reverently receive this from the heart of Heaven, and below, I shall explain it to the Virtuous Lord to dispel calamities and remove all harms. In awe of Heaven’s majesty, how dare I not convey its words in full?

Heaven, in its dawn-light wrath, commanded that I inscribe this for the Perfected One. Hasten to deliver it, that the Supreme Virtuous Lord may obtain it for governance, becoming like unto Heaven—what difference then between him and Heaven?

"Excellent! Excellent! Having heard the words of the Heavenly Master, I now understand that the true qi of Great Peace has indeed arrived. The means by which it is attained have already been revealed. What joy! Why should there be any sorrow?

Now, the people are not your concern—why then do you rejoice at the sight of goodness and grieve at the sight of evil? The reason is this: when the qi of goodness arrives, the qi of evil and wickedness hides away. I remain ever at peace, free from illness and harm. But when the qi of evil arrives, the qi of goodness hides away, making me fear calamity and dare not act—so it is throughout the world. Thus, I rejoice at the sight of goodness."

"Excellent indeed are your words."

"The Heavenly Master, in his compassion, has already expounded the way of the supreme good subject, child, and commoner. I now wish to hear of the art of supreme filial piety."

"Excellent is your difficult question.

Now, the foremost among the supremely good and filial children thinks of his parents growing old and departing. Alone in quietude, he reflects on this, ever grieving in his heart: *How might I obtain the art of undying life, that I may dwell with them always?* He scorns wealth and esteems the Dao, seeking only to sustain them. He composes mournful melodies and sorrowful songs to gladden his parents, transforming their hearts so that they may enter the Dao. Joyfully, he wishes to dwell with them for all time, never knowing age. He ceaselessly seeks rare prescriptions, traveling to distant lands. His utmost sincerity moves Heaven, and he exhausts all his strength in this pursuit.

His clothing and food are sufficient for himself, and he no longer hoards treasures for later generations. Instead, he relieves all the sorrows and hardships of his parents, sparing them the burden of guarding such things. Even the spirits of those who have died before in his household are not pleased by sorrow and hardship. When he eats, he does not seek auspicious blessings but only says: *Strive and take care of yourselves in the earth below—do not torment yourselves by grieving for me.*

This is the conduct of the most excellent filial child of the Highest Antiquity and the First August Emperor. When the four directions hear of his goodness, none fail to rejoice from afar, all desiring to emulate him. Thus do they follow his example, and for the lord and king, they give rise to ministers of kindness and filial piety.

The filial child’s concern for his parents and the good minister’s concern for his lord should be like this.

Perfected One, what you have just spoken of are but the actions of those who seek balance and wish only to preserve their own bodies—what benefit do they bring to their lord, father, or teacher? How can they be called supremely good people? These are merely self-protecting and self-serving individuals.

If even you, Perfected One, regard this as goodness, how much more so would the common people? Those who see themselves as cautious and trustworthy, never violating the king’s laws or incurring guilt, weep and wail, claiming: *I have not betrayed Heaven, nor my lord, father, or teacher.* Yet your conduct merely preserves your own body. You then falsely claim merit before your superiors, wailing to Heaven and Earth—all of you belong to the foolish and inferior, incapable of becoming supremely good people.

Now, I have explained this in detail for the Perfected One so that you may transmit this text to the Supreme Virtuous Lord, deeply instructing the assembly of worthies. Let them all awaken and discern for themselves whether their actions are right or wrong, and whether they truly benefit their lord, father, or teacher.

Since the Middle Antiquity of the Supreme One, people have grown increasingly foolish, daily accumulating wealth and engaging in perverse conduct. Yet they falsely claim merit before Heaven and Earth, their lord, father, and teacher—these are the great rebels, those who utterly fail to comprehend principle. Perfected One, do you not understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"You may be said to have awakened. Now, to practice goodness is truly difficult—take heed. If you do not diligently propagate my teachings to resolve the great afflictions of Heaven and Earth, enabling emperors and kings to wander carefree without worry or trouble, bringing joy to all under Heaven, even extending to the grasses and trees, then you have not yet become a person of supreme goodness. You are merely one who preserves your own body, so how can you be placed alongside Heaven and Earth? Those who seek only to preserve themselves are petty men of the worst sort—do you understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"You may be said to have awakened—take heed!"

"Yes, yes. Now, the Celestial Master, in compassion for the foolish and lowly who fail to grasp the Dao, wishes to hear once more of the conduct of the disciples of supreme goodness."

*[The Master rises and speaks:]*
"Indeed, the disciples of supreme goodness, after receiving the Dao and virtue from their teacher, reflect on their teacher’s grace and thereby attain completion as persons. They then remain ever in the company of the worthy, never straying from their ranks. Some obtain official positions to repay their parents, while others delve deeply into the Dao, mastering the arts of self-nourishment. When a person is born of parents, completes their moral cultivation under a teacher, and gains honor and esteem from their lord, they dwell alone in contemplation, mindful that their lord, father, and teacher will age, with none to succeed them. They constantly ponder how to act in a manner worthy of their teacher, seeking rare methods and extraordinary texts to repay their debt. Such reflection stirs a righteous sorrow, for they find nothing extraordinary. Thus, they further their studies, serving the worthy, entrusting themselves to their teacher, and speaking on their behalf. Some enable their teacher to become a fine minister to the state, thereby further benefiting the governance of emperors and kings. Such are the disciples of supreme goodness from the Highest Antiquity."

*[The Master concludes.]*
"Later generations of enlightened lords and worthies are also called people of supreme goodness. As for you, Perfected One, you may now speak of easy teachings, caution, and trustworthiness. If from this day forward you fail to grasp your teacher’s intent, you will merely be a compliant disciple, concerned only with preserving yourself. How then can you benefit those above, or be called a good disciple? You have spoken at length, yet the common folk—foolish people—constantly claim merit before their teachers, and this is indeed so. As subjects, sons, and disciples, if they do not follow the instructions of their lord, father, or teacher, they commit the great crime of rebellion and forfeit their names. The good sons, subjects, and disciples you describe merely avoid transgression—they do not truly embody goodness. How foolish! What is goodness? Thus, the common people are ignorant, while you alone have long been thoroughly enlightened. Now, by your words, I have measured them and know their truth: they have lost the correct path, entered into falsehood and deception, and remained deluded for so long! Therefore, Heaven alone knows this deeply, and in its anger, it is displeased. Disasters accumulate, and people inherit one another’s burdens. If, as you say, one merely preserves their body without transgression and claims merit before Heaven, Earth, and others, this is the height of folly—take heed again. Your words do not yet fully align with the will of Heaven. My purpose in having you speak is not for your sake, but to observe the gains and losses of the common people, to see what constitutes their greatest transgressions. Thus, I have you speak to discern their crookedness or straightness. Do you also understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go, you have awakened. Originally, when you first awakened as a Perfected One, I did not wish to speak with you. But seeing your earnestness and daily devotion to goodness, I have spoken deeply with you, expounding the intent of Heaven and Earth, resolving the sorrows of emperors and kings, the grievances of the common people, and the disorder of the myriad things. Now that I have set forth these teachings and principles for you, I hold nothing back—simply strive to remember them."

"Yes, yes."

"Previously, I observed many disciples, but none were fit to converse with, so I did not engage in thorough discussion with them. Thus, my Dao has never been transmitted—do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go now, you have understood."

"Very well. Since the Celestial Master has shown compassion for this disciple, granting me unguarded true words: when a lord is worthy, his ministers are many in loyalty; when a teacher is enlightened, his disciples speak without reservation."

"Excellent, your words have grasped the awakened meaning—act upon them."

"Now, do Heaven and Earth truly possess the methods of immortality and the arts of agelessness? Can they be obtained?"

"Excellent question, Perfected One. Indeed, they can be obtained. The elixirs of immortality accumulated in Heaven are as numerous as the grains stored in the Grand Granary; the garments of immortals are as plentiful as the white cloth amassed by the Grand Steward; the dwellings of the multitude of immortals are as numerous as the residences of the imperial bureaucracy. They always dwell in the Great Dao and thus enter Heaven. The Great Dao is the abode and lodging of the divine and numinous. When a person possesses the Dao and virtue, they dwell in the lodgings of the imperial bureaucracy. Heaven does not begrudge the arts of immortality or the garments of transcendence—it is difficult to bestow them upon people. Those without great merit before Heaven and Earth, who cannot govern the great afflictions of Heaven and Earth, harmonize the qi of yin and yang, or benefit the Three Luminaries, the Four Seasons, the Five Phases, and the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth—Heaven does not grant them the arts of immortality or the garments of transcendence. These are reserved for those with extraordinary merit. Do you wish to know their great efficacy?"

Just as the emperor possesses the grain of the Grand Granary and the cloth of the Imperial Weaving Bureau—how many bushels and pecks fill the Grand Granary, yet those without merit or virtue cannot obtain even a single pint. Those who commit transgressions, instead, are cast into its prisons, where their crimes are rectified, their offenses recorded, and their punishments meted out. This is clear proof.

Now, people are truly wicked, discordant with the heart of Heaven, so Heaven does not fully reveal its finest remedies. Instead, day by day, it sends spirits and numinous beings to examine, flog, and strike those without virtue, which is why the sick do not cease and the dead are many. This is like a local magistrate governing chaos: prisons overflow with criminals, and violent deaths abound. Such is the meaning.

If one has rendered great service to the emperor, one’s palace chambers will overflow with official grain and cloth, ensuring constant sustenance and raiment. The destiny of emperors lies in always contemplating governance with the good. Why should they be stingy? The duty of a ruler is to unite with the worthy and, in gentle harmony, govern the world together. A lord without worthy ministers, a father without filial sons, a teacher without obedient and good disciples—such sorrows are beyond words.

Thus, in high antiquity, the Three Sovereigns ruled with folded arms, free from affairs and cares. Their ministers were prudent and good, grieving for their lords, their hearts pained by rectitude, and so they dared to aid their lords in governing the world. Moreover, they sought and obtained the immortal recipes of Heaven to bestow upon their lords, enabling their rulers to attain longevity. Some, having rendered great service, were deemed worthy to ascend together as immortals, jointly administering the affairs of Heaven, where Heaven further provided them with clothing and sustenance. This is clear proof, not empty words.

Yet since the middle antiquity, many have envied the true Dao, sealing and severing it, deceiving one another with false ways, beguiling the people, and reducing the number of the worthy. Thus, rulers and ministers alike suffer hardship, unable to govern the world, and many fail to attain long life. This is not solely the fault of those in the lower antiquity; its origins are long-standing, and the great blame lies here. Do you also understand this?

"Yes, yes."

Thus, Heaven has amassed an incalculable store of rare recipes and immortal garments, yet without great merit, none may obtain them. It is like a person possessing the halls and chambers of a local magistrate, its grain, coin, and cloth—dwelling constantly in the Great Dao, maintaining a household without concealment. Yet those without merit or virtue cannot obtain even a single peck of grain, a single coin, or an inch of cloth. This is clear proof.

Therefore, since the high and middle antiquity, the true Dao has daily waned, and the recipes of true longevity and immortality have become unattainable. Those who, despite their transgressions, attain long life are merely the longest-lived in the world. Why? Where true virtue and power abound, correct qi is plentiful, so people fall ill less and live long. Where deceitful and false refinements multiply, perverse and malign qi abound, so people fall ill often and fail to attain long life. This is the natural law of Heaven.

Thus, the ministers of the Three Sovereigns were rich in the true Dao, so their lords lived long. The ministers of the Five Emperors possessed less of the true Dao, so their lords’ longevity did not match that of the Three Sovereigns. The ministers of the Three Kings possessed even less of the true Dao and could not equal the Five Emperors. The ministers of the Five Hegemons, at best, wrought false refinements and calamities, lacking even a single strand of the true Dao, so many died prematurely. This is clear proof. Those who occasionally attained long life were merely the longest-lived in the world. Do you deeply understand this?

"Yes, yes."

Therefore, the sages and worthies of old merely observed the auspicious and inauspicious omens they received to know their safety or peril, fortune or misfortune. Those who received the highest auspicious omens had already attained the utmost governance. Those who received middling omens resembled middling people. Those who received the lowest omens resembled the lowest people.

"What does this mean?"

It means that if one receives omens like those of the Three Sovereigns, one has attained the highest rank. If one receives omens like those of the Five Emperors, one has attained the middle rank. If one receives omens like those of the Three Kings, one has attained the great middle-lower rank. If one receives omens like those of the Five Hegemons, one has attained the lowest rank.

"How can this be clearly demonstrated?"

Excellent is your question.

Those who govern without punishment yet achieve self-regulation are of the highest rank. Those who issue decrees and are slightly feared or revered are of the middle rank. Those who govern with minor punishments are of the great middle-lower rank. Those who rely on deceptive achievements, falsity as truth, lose their laws, indulge in superficial embellishments, issue empty documents, administer affairs with harsh punishments, proliferate perverse texts, and lack a true Dao to uphold—these are the effects of the lowest hegemonic way.

In ancient times, the sagely and wise merely observed the celestial decrees they received to know their superiority or inferiority.

"To whom should one entrust the wish to receive such teachings?"

It may be that worthy offspring are born to assist in governance, as when a family is about to flourish, it must bear worthy children. Or the Yellow River and Luo River may produce responsive texts and charts as proof—this is the case.

"Do you understand?"

"Yes, indeed."

"Let me further clarify for the Perfected One. When a family is in decline, it bears wicked and malevolent children. When a ruler is in decline, Heaven does not grant worthy and good ministers to assist. When a family is in decline, descendants do not pursue true and upright virtue; instead, they favor flattery, falsity, and superficial embellishments, practicing perverse and licentious methods—thus, the household falls into misfortune and chaos.

Yet when a family prospers, it must seek true virtue, extraordinary texts, and rare methods to save itself. When a lord is about to rise, Heaven bestows upon him true texts, true Dao, and true virtue, and good people join him in governance. The Yellow River and Luo River may still occasionally issue decrees, disasters and harms diminish day by day, auspicious omens arrive daily, and good responses grow ever more numerous—these are the effects."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Go forth, Perfected One, exert yourself with diligence. You shall render great service to Heaven and assist the virtuous lord in attaining wisdom."

"What does this mean?"

"To render great service to Heaven, you are now one who has departed from the world of men. If you cannot gain renown in governance, how can you render service to Heaven?"

"What should I do now?"

"Simply entrust these writings to the Lord of Virtue. The Lord of Virtue is the Son of Heaven, aligned with the will of Heaven. Through this governance, he shall repay Heaven’s profound merit, pacify the realm, and elevate his own standing—thus, you too shall attain good fortune and preserve your longevity."

"Excellent! Indeed, indeed."

"Go forth, the discourse on the three practices is now complete. Let this be shown to all worthy and ordinary people, that later generations who seek to do good may follow this path."

"I dare not. Yet those who pursue only their own wealth and profit claim to do good, placing themselves above Heaven, the lord, the father, and the teacher."

"The practices of which the Perfected One speaks may still be balanced and elevated, but the deeply foolish who accumulate evil natures and wicked deeds are beyond enumeration. If these writings are passed down to later generations, and each person earnestly examines and practices them, how can they fail to benefit Heaven, the lord, the father, and the teacher? Yet if their actions merely increase for their own protection and profit—Heaven knows the hearts of men all too well, hence the multitude of afflictions."

"Well said! This foolish student has beheld the words of the Heavenly Heart Master and is greatly awakened."

"You may be called one easily awakened. In this world, there are many deeply foolish people who trust only their own ignorant hearts and no longer heed the words of others. The fault lies in their destruction of the Heavenly Dao, causing emperors and kings to suffer distress. This arises precisely from such deeply foolish scholars, who envy true Dao and virtuous power, dismissing what is worthy while trusting their own unbenevolent hearts. Heaven is pained by this, and thus has sent forth these writings for lords of supreme virtue, that they may attain this Way, secure their persons, and bring order to governance. Those who align with the will of Heaven—the sovereigns of the Great Antiquity and the August Emperors who were deeply favored by Heaven—precisely followed this path. Does the Perfected One not understand?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"Go now, you have understood—depart and reflect upon it."
"Indeed, indeed. I humbly ask to inquire one more matter."
"Speak."
"Master of Heaven, you have expounded these teachings and texts—why are they so numerous?"
"Excellent, your question! It may be said you have grasped the intent of the Dao. Yet the world’s preferences for good and evil are equal in principle but differ in application. Thus the Dao is largely the same but varies in minor ways. This single matter is divided into fifteen hundred and twenty characters, yet even this is but a small portion of the Heavenly Dao, a mere outline of the kingly Way. If one were to encompass all that exists between Heaven and Earth, above and below, the eight directions, the six conjunctions, and inner and outer realms, this text could not contain its power. Does the Perfected One understand?"
"Indeed, indeed."
"Go now, you have understood. Entrust this text to a lord of virtue and power, that he may promulgate it and enable all people to reflect upon their conduct and its gains and losses, thereby relieving the afflictions of Heaven and Earth and bringing peace to emperors and kings—then governance will swiftly be ordered. Does the Perfected One comprehend?"
"Indeed, indeed."
"Go now, be diligent and do not neglect this."
"Indeed, indeed."

Here is the translation:

---

**Section Sixty-Four: Distinguishing the Right Conduct of Rulers and Ministers, Fathers and Sons, Masters and Disciples, and Discerning Good and Evil, Gains and Losses in Their Actions—Governing People Through the Dao, Not Through Coercion**

The Perfected One stepped forward. "Should ordinary people govern others through stern authority, fear, cunning, and constant coercion? Is this not improper? Speak with precision."

"Indeed, people ought to govern others through stern authority, fear, cunning, and coercion. Why? Because only thus can one rectify and rule others."

"Alas! The Perfected One speaks as a mere commoner, unworthy of the title *Upper Perfected One*. Your words are those of the vulgar, failing to align with the heart of Heaven. The discourse of an *Upper Perfected One* must harmonize with the heart of Heaven. Now, to govern others through stern authority, fear, cunning, and coercion—this is detested not only by ghosts and spirits but also by the gods of yin and yang. Indeed, since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the shared affliction of the world, the very disorder that all seek to remedy, arises from this coercive governance. It does not bring true submission.

Thus, those who submit under duress harbor resentment, and ghosts and spirits, Heaven and Earth, come to their aid. People, too, resist those who coerce them and assist those who are coerced.

Therefore, the ancient Three Sovereigns and supreme sages governed others through the utmost Dao and virtue. They did not rely on stern authority, fear, cunning, or coercion. Those who govern through stern authority, fear, cunning, punishments, and penalties are no different from bandits and thieves. Bandits and thieves, too, rely on such means to coerce others. How, then, can the noble distinguish themselves and manifest their difference? Yet the Perfected One advocates this—is this not folly?

Such governance has been the source of disorder in Heaven and Earth since the middle antiquity. Do you understand?

Thus, in high antiquity, rulers of virtue and power did not govern the people through stern authority, fear, cunning, or coercion. In middle antiquity, such methods were symbolically established but not dared to be employed. In later antiquity, stern authority, fear, cunning, punishments, and penalties were used sparingly to govern the people, yet disorder still arose.

When foolish generals of the lowest order rise, the way of hegemony flourishes. They intimidate their officers and soldiers with authority and punishments, and so officials and commoners repeatedly rebel.

Therefore, those who govern through the Dao live in clarity and purity. Those who govern through virtue advance and retreat with measured balance. Thus, the people of later antiquity are difficult to govern, for they are full of cunning.

Heaven is governed by the Dao, and so its form is clear; the Three Luminaries shine brightly. Earth is governed by virtue, and so it endures humiliation. Humans are governed by harmony, and so they advance and retreat with ease, their words ever-changing and inconstant.

Heaven’s rectitude lies in its beginning, Earth’s in its middle, and humanity’s in its lowest position. Being at the lowest extreme, it turns upward.

How do we know it has reached the lowest extreme? By its words, which shift without constancy, and its speech, which varies with entry and exit.

These three qi have reached their lowest extreme. When the lowest extreme turns upward, it returns to the Dao, and only then is Great Peace achieved, resembling Heaven. When it turns to virtue, it attains middle peace, resembling Earth. When it turns to harmony, it achieves minor order, resembling humanity."

"When one resorts to stern awe, cunning deceit, and punishments, chaos arises daily, resembling the hegemonic rulers who wielded severe penalties. Now, if the Perfected One advocates stern awe, cunning deceit, and punishments, this is to violate the celestial principle."

"Yet the Celestial Master says one should not rely on stern awe and punishments. Why then does Heaven at times send thunder and lightning to strike people down?"

"Excellent! Your question has grasped the essence. The reason for such strikes is that rulers, through their reverence and authority, may inflict harm, thereby wronging others. Though humans are most noble, they may reduce others to the level of livestock, and thus Heaven punishes them. It aids those who submit to human sustenance, for this is what people detest.

Therefore, in the world, whether great or small, those who lightly wrong others will all be seen and punished, while Heaven pities and assists those who submit. Thus, the noble person who subdues others should rely solely on the Dao and virtue, not on predation or harm to wrong others.

Stern awe and cunning deceit can only subdue the lawless, not those of moral integrity. Those who wish to act without the Dao should be placed below such measures. It is like the Thunder Duke striking the lawless—this cannot be a constant practice. To act contrary to the will of Heaven and Earth, yet seek their favor, one must follow the Dao and virtue.

Thus, the sages of antiquity valued the Dao and virtue, using benevolence and love to prevail over others, not stern awe and punishments to startle and subdue. Those who rely on crooked power to intimidate and subjugate others prevent the qi of the Supreme August One’s Great Peace from aiding human governance.

The reason is this: when governance is unknown to the people, or when great grievances are bound yet none dare speak out—like bandits stealing clothes, where people know the wrong yet dare not speak, instead praising them as generals or lords—this is the case. Or when the weak lack the strength to defend themselves and dare not speak, all is blocked and cut off, causing the yin and yang of Heaven’s qi to fall into disharmony.

Heaven’s mandate to rulers is fundamentally to govern the strong and assist the weak. Yet predatory officials instead use stern awe and threats, employing cunning deceit to startle and frighten, causing the balanced qi to arrive. When a virtuous ruler governs, they fear such actions will disrupt the proper qi, and thus this is shown to the Perfected One.

It is entrusted to the ruler of supreme virtue to demonstrate to the worthy and the common people, so that officials and citizens may reflect on governance and benefit their superiors. Take care not to disrupt it. Does the Perfected One now understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go, you have now awakened. Depart, and always be cautious in speech; do not speak recklessly, for Heaven is not human."
"Yes, yes."

"When people fall short, it is better to ask questions."
"Yes, yes."

*Chapter 65: The Threefold Union and Mutual Communication*

Chunjin bows again and says, "I venture to ask one matter."
"What does the Perfected One doubt?"
"From morning study to evening return, I constantly dwell in quietude, pondering its essential meaning, and dare not grow lax. Yet in the Celestial Master’s writings, there is often mention of the *shanghuang* ‘Supreme August’ *qi* of Great Peace being about to arrive. What is meant by *shang* ‘supreme’? What by *huang* ‘august’? What by *tai* ‘great’? What by *ping* ‘peace’? And what by *qi* ‘qi’?"
"Perfected One, why do you now suddenly wish to question such subtle and profound meanings all at once?"
"The reason I venture to ask the Celestial Master to fully explain the meaning of the text is that the writings frequently speak of the *shanghuang qi* being about to arrive, yet I have not grasped its essential meaning. If I do not now seize the opportunity to ask the enlightened Celestial Master, I fear I may never have another chance to know it. Thus, I dare not fail to ask in full."
"Excellent are your words, unchanging for ten thousand generations! When the time of Heaven’s perfect Dao, great virtue, and flourishing benevolence has arrived, the numinous power of the August One delights in humanity’s swift compliance. Thus, Heaven’s qi stirs your heart, prompting you to inquire day and night. Heaven’s laws are meticulous—I marvel at this."

"Very well."
"Perfected One, sit at ease. I shall fully explain the meaning of these characters so that they may be transmitted without end. Now, the character *shang* ‘supreme’ is written with one stroke, then another vertical stroke in the center, and above it another embracing stroke. One above becomes three ones, ascending without cease, never descending again. Thus, it is called *shang*—its form admits nothing above it. Reversed, it becomes *xia* ‘below’: one stroke, another vertical stroke in the center, then a stroke embracing downward. Its movement descends without end, never ascending again. Thus, it is called *xia*. Those whose will constantly tends downward will, over time, sink to the lowest point, with nowhere further to descend. This is like the turbid, which delights in descending to become Earth—thus Earth is the lowest, with nowhere further to descend. The character *shang* constantly ascends, never descending again. This is like the pure, which delights in ascending to become Heaven—thus Heaven admits nothing above it. Therefore, in Heaven’s laws, each name is determined by its own form, and all things under Heaven follow this principle.

*[Start]*
Thus, the sages established laws, all modeled on Heaven’s intent. To guard the One and delight in ascending divination—divination means inquiry. To constantly delight in ascending and inquiring without cease is the most auspicious and supreme path. Thus, the character *shang* is written with one stroke ascending in divination. The character *xia* descends in one stroke of divination—divination means inquiry. Those who constantly think and inquire while descending will reach the lowest point, and those who delight in descending further will never ascend again.

*[End]*
Thus, the character *shang* admits nothing above it, signifying that governance should daily ascend, aligning with Heaven’s heart, with nothing above it."

"Excellent! Excellent! Fortunate is the enlightened Master who pities and explains the character *shang*. *[Start]* I now wish to hear about the character *huang* ‘august.’"
"To be king for a day: the stroke above is Heaven. Heaven is numbered as one; when Heaven receives the sun, it shines with great brilliance and becomes king. Thus, the character is formed by combining one and the sun with king, creating *huang*. One is Heaven, and Heaven is a ruler; the sun is also a ruler, and king is also a ruler. Three rulers combine to form the character *huang*. *Huang* signifies its numinous power, resplendent and radiant—thus it is called *huang*. The August One is the first under Heaven, with nothing able to surpass it."

*[End]*
*[Appendix]* The character *huang* is formed by one, the sun, and king. The stroke above is Heaven’s number; when it attains one and receives the sun’s illumination, it then shines with great brilliance and becomes king. One, the sun, and king combine to form *huang*. One is Heaven, and Heaven is a ruler; the sun embodies the ruler’s virtue, and king is also a ruler. Three rulers together form *huang*, signifying flourishing virtue, resplendent and radiant—the first under Heaven, with nothing able to surpass it.

"Excellent! Excellent! Fortunate is the Master who pities and explains the character *huang*. *[Start]* I now wish to hear about the characters *taiping qi* ‘Great Peace qi.’"
"*Tai* means great, signifying its accumulated greatness, vast as Heaven. All things are great, with nothing greater than Heaven. *Ping* means that its governance is greatly balanced, all affairs properly ordered, with no selfishness or deceit. *Ping* is like Earth, which dwells below and maintains balance—this is Earth’s balance. It is like a person who plants goodness and reaps goodness, plants evil and reaps evil. If people exert effort in goodness, their possessions multiply. If you favor goodness, people will respond with little, and their possessions will be meager and poor. *Qi* signifies Heaven’s qi, joyfully descending to generate life, and Earth’s qi, obediently ascending to nurture. The law of qi operates between Heaven and Earth: yin and yang unite, intermingling to create harmony. Together with the central harmonious qi, the three qi mutually nourish all things, loving and communicating without harm. *Tai* means great; *ping* means upright; *qi* governs nurturing and communication through harmony. Attaining this in governance brings Great Peace and harmony, and supreme greatness—thus it is said the *taiping qi* arrives."

"Excellent! Excellent! Does this refer solely to the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth uniting and communicating to govern? Should all affairs be handled through the union of the three?"
"Excellent! Excellent! Your words have grasped Heaven’s laws. Emperors and kings model their governance upon them—you are like a spirit!"

"Now I shall explain this fully to you, Perfected One, that you may follow and record it."
"Yes, yes."

"The primordial qi and the natural qi of Great Harmony communicate, joining forces with one heart. In that fleeting moment before form arose, the three qi congealed and together gave birth to Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth communicate with the central harmonious qi, joining forces with one heart to give birth to all things. All things communicate with the Three Luminaries, joining forces with one heart to illuminate Heaven and Earth. The five phases—hard and soft—of all things communicate with the central harmonious qi, joining forces with one heart to complete and perfect the myriad things. The qi of the four seasons—yin and yang—communicate with the central harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, joining forces with one heart to bring forth the benefits of Heaven and Earth’s creatures. The three months of each season communicate, joining forces with one heart, each completing one aspect. The high and low, level and uneven of the Earth communicate, joining forces with one heart to produce and nurture the creatures of Heaven and Earth. The male and female of creeping and moving creatures unite, together giving birth to harmony, communicating, joining forces with one heart to propagate their kind. Man and woman communicate, joining forces with one heart to bear children. Three people communicate, joining forces with one heart to govern a household. Ruler, minister, and people communicate, joining forces with one heart to complete a state. All these originate from the primordial qi and the natural mandate of Heaven and Earth. In all matters, only when the three communicate can the Dao be accomplished."

*Tai* means great, signifying its vast accumulation like Heaven—nothing is greater than Heaven. *Ping* means governing with Great Equality, where all matters are settled without imbalance, just as the Earth, dwelling below, upholds levelness. It is like a person sowing and reaping: sowing good yields good, sowing evil yields evil. The labor of plowing is repaid with abundant harvests. The qi of Heaven delights in descending; the qi of Earth delights in ascending. The two qi communicate, forming the central harmonious qi, which receives and nurtures all things without harm—thus it is called Great Peace. Heaven and Earth, with the central harmonious qi, share one heart to give birth to the myriad things. Man and woman share one heart to bear children; father, mother, and child share one heart to complete a household; ruler, minister, and people share one heart to complete a state. In harmonious generation, the three constantly communicate, joining forces with one heart to govern one office, to complete one task. If even one is lacking, misfortune arises.

Thus, with yang alone and no yin, nothing can be born, and governance perishes; with yin alone and no yang, nothing can be born, and governance perishes; with yin and yang but no harmony, nothing can propagate its kind, and all perishes. Therefore, with Heaven but no Earth, all things have no place to rest; with Earth but no Heaven, all things have no place to be born; with Heaven and Earth connected but no harmony, things cannot mutually sustain and nurture themselves. Thus, a man cannot give birth alone, nor can a woman nurture alone. Without man and woman, how can children be born? Without children, how can a household be formed, or how can one be called father and mother? Therefore, Heaven’s law always requires the union of three to accomplish anything.

Thus, the sages of antiquity deeply understood Heaven’s principles and modeled their governance upon them. The ruler is as father, symbolizing Heaven; the minister is as mother, symbolizing Earth; the people are as child, symbolizing harmony. Heaven’s mandated law decrees that all bustling creatures must communicate as three, joining forces with one heart to govern and complete one task, to complete one household, to become one body. This is Heaven’s command to rely upon one another—none can be lacking. If one matter is entangled in grievance and not resolved, the three are ruined, and the three misfortunes arise.

Thus, the ruler needs the minister, the minister needs the people, the people need the minister, and the minister needs the ruler—only then can one matter be accomplished. If even one is lacking, the three cannot be completed. Therefore, a ruler without people and ministers cannot be called a ruler; with ministers and people but no ruler, they cannot be called ministers and people. Without a ruler, ministers and people fall into chaos, unable to govern themselves or become good ministers and people. These three rely upon one another to stand; only when they come together can they be accomplished. Thus, ruler, minister, and people must follow Heaven’s law, communicating as three, joining forces with one heart to become one household. It is like husband, wife, and child forming one household—none can be without the others. This is Heaven’s essential Dao.

This is like a person having head, feet, and abdomen to become a complete body—nothing can be removed. Remove any, and it is incomplete, no longer a person. This is the natural principle of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the sages of antiquity took their model from Heaven: a man must obtain a compliant and good woman to govern with, and then they may have good children. The man is the ruler; the woman is the minister; the child is the people. Therefore, Heaven’s mandated way of governing a state is to befriend worthy and enlightened ministers, and only then can the people be harmonized. A good woman can then bear good children, and good ministers can then nurture good people. When both ministers and people are good, they can long secure peace for their superior.

Perfected One, if you wish to know its effects: Heaven is the ruler; Earth is the minister. When Heaven’s rain flows everywhere, the good earth gives birth to good things, while the bad earth gives birth to bad things—this is the meaning. Now, fathers, mothers, rulers, and ministers merely uphold the great guiding principles. The essential truth is that they rely upon their children for clothing and food. Without children, there is no posterity; when a ruler lacks people, there is insufficient clothing and food, causing constant worry and distress. Thus, the way of governing a state takes the people as its foundation. Without people, ruler and minister have nothing to govern, nothing to order. Therefore, the great sages of antiquity, in governing, devoted day and night to the people as their greatest urgency, worrying for their people. Like parents worrying over having no children—without children, how can one be called father and mother? Without people, how can one be called a ruler? Thus, Heaven’s law always makes ruler, minister, and people share the same fate, the same life, the same fortune and misfortune."

"A single office or matter losing its proper course becomes a great misfortune. Since the middle ancient times, the guiding principles of governance have often been lost, and this failure has been passed down through generations. Those born later thus suffer even more severely from its consequences, truly because ruler, minister, and people have erred in their plans, failing to deeply reflect and consider, to mutually care for and communicate with one another, to join forces and unite in purpose. Instead, they only bring sorrow and suffering upon each other.

The ruler is but one person, yet he may dwell in profound seclusion, with grievances from the four distant quarters accumulating and blocking all passage, governance failing to align with Heaven’s heart. Disasters, anomalies, and strange omens pile up without remedy. What Heaven and Earth wish to say, the ruler cannot know—this is the great fault. Without the three—ruler, minister, and people—joining their strength, wisdom is cut off, and perverse qi congeals without resolution.

Above, this makes one an enemy of Great Heaven; below, it brings great blame upon Earth. It is the great sorrow of emperors and kings, with disasters swarming unceasingly. It is the great harm to the people, the great affliction of all things. Such has accumulated over a long time—it is not merely the fault of those in the present or recent past.

Do you, Perfected One, understand this?"

"Long have I known this to be so, yet truly I know not how it came to pass—thus my earnest inquiry, for it is grievous indeed. What then is to be done?"

"Now, the qi of Great Peace from Heaven is about to arrive. When governance aligns with Heaven’s heart, all these evils will vanish of themselves. Thus has Heaven sent me to expound this fully. It desires that I remedy these failings and set forth the correct writings, which is why it has sent you, Perfected One, to inquire so thoroughly. This is how misfortune arises: by failing to model the natural laws of Heaven and Earth’s primordial qi, by failing to ensure the three—ruler, minister, and people—communicate and join strength with one mind. If the three communicate, joining strength with one mind, great peace and joy will be established at once, and disasters will vanish."

"I wish to hear how governance should proceed."

"Hasten to model Heaven’s laws, as I have described above. Heaven’s law decrees that all matters require the three to join strength with one mind. Thus does Heaven take the Three Luminaries as its pattern: the Three Luminaries ever communicate and shine together without ceasing. Since the Heavenly Contract was issued, humankind has used writing to govern, modeling the Three Luminaries. Thus does Heaven frequently cause the River Chart and Luo Writings to emerge, reinforcing the written patterns of human governance. It delights in modeling Heaven’s all-pervading, divine methods of governance, so that goodness daily flourishes and evil daily perishes.

Writing is simply the circulation of documents along three pathways. The ruler should skillfully guide those below, issuing clear decrees and instructions, teaching the people to remain in their places and submit memorials, fully reporting all they know of good and evil. They may send them by return post, or entrust them to passing merchants’ carts, or even come in person with their names and details clearly stated. When the method is thus, the good and evil of the realm will be fully revealed.

The ruler channels Heaven’s qi downward to communicate; the minister channels Earth’s qi upward to communicate; the people channel the qi of harmony upward to communicate. Perfected One, transmit this writing to a ruler of virtue. If he carefully heeds my words, great peace and joy will be established, and anomalies will vanish—not a fraction will be lost. My writings are reverently received from Heaven’s laws; they are not empty, false words. If Heaven were to execute my disciples, would you not know the gravity of this punishment?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"If you wish to obtain my writings, once you trust them, put them into effect and observe the results. When they resonate in response with Heaven and Earth, that is the proof of my words’ truth. By this great and clear verification, you may cast aside all doubt.

The Dao of governing the state, which delights in aligning with Heaven’s heart and finds security therein, lies simply in implementing this method and resonating in response with Heaven. This is the bright contract by which Heaven and humankind converse. I have seen that you, Perfected One, constantly delight in aiding virtuous rulers, wishing to repay Heaven’s great merit—thus have I spoken these few words.

I know the fault lies in this blockage and lack of communication. Once you receive this writing, the ruler should create clear teachings and good decrees. Proclaim that from this day forward, officials and people should remain in their places and diligently submit memorials, fully reporting good and evil to illuminate the governance of emperors and kings and to communicate with Heaven’s qi. None may obstruct this; those who do shall be punished for their offense for three years. Those who submit memorials in utmost sincerity, without deceit in their words, shall be summoned and employed.

How shall they be employed? Each shall be questioned regarding their talents and abilities, and appointed to a post within the scope of their strength. Why must they be appointed only to what their strength can bear? Heaven deals with people according to their abilities. To appoint someone beyond their capacity is to wrong them, and this will only congeal qi and increase disasters. The reason is this: what a person cannot do, even if you raise them from the dead, they still could not accomplish.

What people delight in most is obtaining fine things—gold and jade. Suppose a wise ruler issued a decree: whoever can clap their hands and obtain all the gold, silver, and rare treasures of the realm’s officials shall have them all, without limit. The person would be overjoyed to receive them, yet if their strength could not reach the objects, even if you bound their hands and exhausted them, they still could not obtain them.

Now, as parents and rulers, when appointing ministers and children to office, if you do not employ them according to their strengths but instead force them into positions that kill them, they will be unable to manage their duties. This will only disorder their offices, bringing sorrow and suffering to the people. When offices are disordered and the people and ministers grieve, they will look up and cry out to Heaven, proclaiming their grievances. This will move Heaven and increase anomalies.

Thus did the sages and worthies of old, wishing to align with Heaven’s heart, take great care in appointments, ensuring all were in accord with the people’s hearts. Thus were they able to accord with Heaven’s heart. What does it mean to accord with Heaven’s heart? When governance elicits a response from the people, and officials daily grow more good, faithful, and loyal—that is the proof. Then they should be promoted in due time; these are the people who aid the state in aligning with Heaven’s heart.

Some, however, seek only pleasure, greedily obtaining office for its name, yet their conduct yields no results and does not accord with Heaven’s heart or elicit a response. The emperor and kings govern by inheriting Heaven’s heart; they must accord with it. Failure to do so is a fault. If their governance yields no good response, they should be demoted to reflect on their errors. When this is done, Heaven will rejoice, and throughout the realm, none will fail to be utterly loyal and faithful, exhausting their abilities. Even those in distant, hidden places will hear of it and conceal their talents no longer.

For those who urgently submit memorials: human life is of the utmost weight and cannot be delayed for even a moment. If people continue to wail and cry out their grievances, anomalies and strange changes will only increase. Resolve and report them swiftly. Matters that can be endured should wait until autumn and winter. Why must they wait until autumn and winter? Because in autumn, all things reach completion, and in winter, all things are stored away—Heaven’s qi is settled. When things ripen in the eighth month of mid-autumn, their fruits and kernels can be distinguished. Thus should one follow the laws of Heaven and Earth, beginning in the eighth month to examine and distinguish them. The ninth month is the culmination of Heaven’s qi; by the ninth month, all things are ready to die. Thus should one thoroughly examine and read them in the ninth month, observing the abundance of good and evil.

The number ten is the end of all numbers, so by the tenth month, things return to their beginning. Heaven’s norm takes the eighth month as the tenth month, thus all things reach completion; Earth’s norm takes the ninth month as the tenth month, thus all things reach old age."

The human norm takes the tenth month as the month of *hai*, thus all things reach their death. The Three Norms are complete, and things should be reborn. Therefore, the *Gan* resides in the northwest, and all things begin their kernel in *hai*. Heaven’s law distinguishes them in the eighth month, examines them thoroughly in the ninth month, and verifies their kernels in the tenth month. Thus, the Three Norms of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity all conclude, their kernels verified in *hai*. Therefore, in the tenth month, their kernels are verified and handed down for return. The reason for this is that these three months—eighth, ninth, and tenth—are when the norms of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity all reach their culmination and should revert to their beginning. If they are not verified and their kernels not confirmed, their meaning is not attained. Heaven and Earth will not be pleased, their disasters will not be dispelled, and harm will befall the coming year. Thus, in the eighth month, one distinguishes and examines them; in the ninth month, one thoroughly examines them; and in the tenth month, one verifies their kernels and hands them down for return. This allows officials and the people to reflect anew on their transgressions and dare not repeat them. In the coming year, officials and the people will be more vigilant, and all things will be good. If they are not made to return and reflect on their transgressions, the people and ministers below will lose governance and decrees, unaware of their faults, and their hearts will not change. The Dao of Heaven is unyielding; evil will not change. Therefore, they must be made to return.

If the True Person wishes to know its efficacy, let them take what is handed down for return this year and record one copy for themselves, and also instruct officials and the people to each record one copy for themselves, observing the abundance of good and evil—this is called the "Heavenly Contract." In the coming year, when handing down for return, record another copy and observe the abundance of good and evil. Do this again the following year, recording another copy and observing the abundance of good and evil. Compare the records below with those above, and they should correspond—this is called the "Heavenly Signs Aligning in Accord." This will make officials and the people change their hearts and do good, aligning with the Will of Heaven. What is submitted should then be mostly good; if great change is made, there should be great goodness. If they remain obstinate, unchanged and unyielding, what is submitted will remain obstinate. If they persist in evil without cease, what is submitted will grow worse. If officials and the people greatly deceive and defy Heaven, what is submitted will be greatly evil and increasingly severe. Thus, this is the mirror that brightly illuminates the hearts of Heaven—it does not err by even a fraction, clearly revealing the conduct of officials and the people.

Heaven and Earth are like echoes and shadows, following what people do without fail. True Person, if you have good intentions, strive to complete this and be vigilant. Though you have come to ask about this, if it were without purpose or benefit, Heaven would silently observe. What can your words clarify? When people speak, if their words are detailed and good, others respond with goodness, and the echo likewise answers with goodness. If their words are inauspicious and evil, others respond with evil, and the echo likewise answers with evil. All things that correspond and harmonize are made so by Heaven. Do you understand now?

"Yes, yes."

Heaven is lofty, distant, and revered—how could it speak with people below on every matter? Thus, its laws all respond naturally in harmony. Has your heart now opened?

"Yes, yes. I understand. I wish to ask the Heavenly Master one more question."

"Follow the Way."

"In the middle antiquity, the August Emperor had no texts, and the Three Norms were not interconnected. How could stability be achieved?"

Excellent is your question. The movements of Heaven made the people of that time upright and simple; they all embraced the Dao, and their faith was unwavering. They communicated through oral transmission, each person desiring utmost sincerity and trust, seeking to align with the Heart of Heaven—there was not a single instance of deception. Thus, ruler, minister, and people joined their strength and united their hearts, enabling governance. If they had not been of one heart like a single family, there would have been chaos. Now, we bear the weight of the past, and texts are numerous. Yet, with increasing texts, deception grows, and even the worthy and learned are deluded, collectively losing the Heart of Heaven. Since Heaven has given rise to texts, oral transmission is no longer possible. One must verify and attain their true essence, and when the Three Norms are interconnected, the qi of Heaven will be balanced.

The laws of Heaven vary by the hundreds of millions, differing from time to time. Governance is distinct in each case, and methods vary. Now, as the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, one must verify the original, correct characters of texts to align with the Heart and Will of Heaven. If you cannot distinguish, since Heaven and Earth established affairs, their governance has had countless approaches. Those who carry out their affairs and receive Heaven’s response are correct; those who do not receive Heaven’s response are not. This is the great clarity of the Heavenly Contract’s signs and proofs. Do you understand now?

"Yes, yes."

"Go now, and do not ask further. Though I could recount for you all matters since Heaven and Earth established affairs—explaining each character of the world’s texts—yet the proliferation of writings would overwhelm memory, serve no practical use, and bring no benefit to the king’s governance. Thus, I have only imparted the essential Dao in guidance.

For when governance falls into disorder, it stems from the patterns of Heaven—this is the great affliction of Heaven and Earth, what the sages and worthies of ancient times jointly despised. Therefore, when a virtuous ruler emerges by the Dao, he dares not create new texts but instead returns to upholding reality, seeking its root, preserving its origin. Only then may the Dao of Heaven be ordered, and the state naturally find peace.

Though you, Perfected One, are fond of inquiry, do not allow writings to proliferate further. Go and reflect upon this."

*Collated and Combined Scroll 49 of the C-Section, Fifteenth Chapter of the* Scripture on Great Peace
*Scroll Forty-Nine of the* Scripture on Great Peace

**Urgent Study of the True Methods, Sixty-Sixth [Section]**

Before you, Perfected One, the harmonious qi of goodness is now arriving in full. Yet people merely wander without duties—how then may their hearts be illuminated and their intentions rectified, so that they suddenly forget evil and daily grow fond of goodness, without knowing why? How may the Emperor sit with folded arms, nothing left to govern, while those of supreme virtue fill his court, and loyal, trustworthy, filial sons are all complete? By what means may this be achieved?

You, Perfected One, possess a Heaven-born heart that delights in goodness and constantly strives in concern for the Dao of Heaven. You should refine yourself and set forth a full explanation.

"Indeed, one must urgently study the true Dao, true virtue, and true benevolence."

"Why must one study the true Dao?"

"The Dao alone can guide and transform without limit, cherishing life beyond measure. Those who possess the true Dao bear the name of supreme goodness; those without the Dao bear the name of utmost evil—decay, misfortune, transgression, death, and ruin."

"Perfected One, your words on true goodness are perfect—I have nothing to add. Why must one study true virtue?"

"Those who possess true virtue can envelop and nurture without end. Those without virtue bear the name of the most inferior, weak, distressed, and impoverished."

"Excellent indeed are your words, Perfected One—I have nothing to add, for they are truly true. Why must one study the Way of benevolence?"

"Benevolence alone can embrace all with kindness, delighting in boundless giving. Those without benevolence reverse goodness into hatred and stinginess, bearing the name of great greed and baseness. Their aspirations are no different from beasts, and they cannot distinguish themselves."

"Excellent! Perfected One, I have nothing to add to these words."

"Now, Perfected One, you have spoken of three matters—I have nothing to add. Should people today strive to do good, or should they not?"

"One must exert effort to learn and do good."

"In doing good, does it not also bear a name and designation?"

"Your disciple does not yet grasp this—pray, Master, enlighten me."

"Very well. Those who do good align their actions with the heart of Heaven and do not contravene human intent—they are called good. Goodness is utterly supreme, sharing its name with the Dao. It is what Heaven loves, what Earth nurtures, what emperors must urgently attend to, and what ministers and rulers must unite in heart and strength to uphold. As for evil, it runs counter to the heart of Heaven and constantly harms human intent. It inverts the Dao of Heaven, disrupts the four seasons, incurs the hatred of spirits and deities, and is what people most despise—like the greatest harm to parents, the sorrow of the noble, and the most wretched and ruinous name under Heaven. Thus, in human conduct, losing good fortune leads to misfortune, while departing from misfortune leads to good fortune. One moment of good, one moment of evil—such are the ways of the impure and careless. Do you understand this?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"In your view, Perfected One, how should people conduct themselves?"

"Now, if people do not exert effort to study the Dao, they are deemed ignorant of it and are called people without the Dao. Those without the Dao are the most wicked and calamitous of people. If they do not exert effort to study virtue, they are deemed ignorant of it. Those without virtue who delight in harm and injury are omens of ruin. If people do not exert effort to study benevolence, they are already without benevolence. Those without benevolence walk the same path as beasts; if people share the same heart as beasts, they are but slightly better than the dead. If people do not diligently study goodness day and night, losing goodness leads them into evil. Evil is the dwelling place of death and misfortune. Thus, if people do not exert effort to study good fortune, they inevitably fall into misfortune. Misfortune is the most despised name under Heaven."

"Excellent! You have deeply entered the true Dao and will no longer revert to evil. Perfected One, you have long concealed wisdom and feigned ignorance—why is this?"

"I dared not act presumptuously."

"You are fortunate to have such ability. Speak fully of what you know—I am greatly pleased. Now that you have reached this point, having heard my words, will you turn away and abandon them?"

"I dare not. Having received your repeated instructions, I spoke only as far as my understanding allowed, not daring to exhaust the matter."

"Excellent are your words, ever so humble."

"Now, with all my heart, I seek the true gate—pray, Heavenly Master, instruct me in what I have not yet grasped."

"Very well. What you have just said is entirely correct. Thus, the great sages of antiquity, the Three Sovereigns, diligently studied the true Dao day and night. Those who did not study the true Dao were called people without the Dao. The conduct of those without the Dao is boundless, incurring Heaven’s greatest resentment. Those without the Dao are not desired by Heaven to be covered, nor by Earth to be borne. Spirits, deities, and ghosts do not wish to protect them, and all under Heaven suffer because of them. Sages, worthies, and noble persons deeply detest those without the Dao. Therefore, in the era of the Supreme Sovereigns, people all studied purity and stillness, deeply understanding the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth. Thus, they all studied the true Dao and thereby aligned with the heart of Heaven and the intent of Earth. Those who did not exert effort to study virtue were called people without virtue. Those without virtue are not loved by Heaven nor favored by Earth; people do not wish to draw near them. Their conduct is always devoid of virtue, bringing harm to rulers and disaster to noble persons. Ghosts and spirits, following Heaven’s decree, do not long support them. Thus, the worthies and sages of antiquity, upon seeing those without virtue, would not even exchange words with them. If one does not diligently study benevolence day and night, one will soon neglect affairs and become without benevolence. Those without benevolence speak in ways that contravene all matters, wounding human hearts and opposing the intent of Heaven. They resemble beasts, and thus the sages and worthies of antiquity did not walk the same path as them. Now, if people do not serve a teacher and exert effort to study goodness, they will remain ignorant and benighted, unaware of how to do good. Instead, they indulge their ignorant hearts and lightly commit evil. The conduct of evil people—those benighted and foolish—does not accord with the Dao of Heaven and Earth. They bring trouble to noble persons, disgrace their parents, grieve their clans, and act lawlessly. Ghosts and spirits, following the heart of Heaven, are displeased with them, bringing severe harm in three ways. By law, they deserve execution. The sages of antiquity regarded them as the greatest enemies. Thus, in ancient times, all verified and examined their learning, ensuring it aligned with the heart of Heaven and entered into the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and goodness. Their conduct had to accord with the heart of Heaven and Earth, not relying on superficial or flowery words. The reason for this is that losing the law of Heaven leads to misfortune, calamity, and short life, or even harm to later generations. The Dao of Heaven does not err—it has its standards and measures. Those who do not exert effort to study the great and auspicious Dao but instead treat matters lightly and carelessly will inevitably fall into misfortune. Misfortune is detested by Heaven, Earth, people, and all things; it cannot endure long. It is the root of great disaster, the gateway to calamity. Once one falls into it, death follows, and there is no return or repentance. All under Heaven know this, yet petty scholars and the greatly foolish often mock the Dao, unaware of guarding it and avoiding misfortune early. They pass on their folly, burdening one another. Later generations grow even more ignorant than those before. Thus, the true Dao is obstructed and does not spread, causing people to treat it lightly and carelessly, unable to fulfill their Heaven-appointed years. The great fault and error lie precisely here. Perfected One, upon seeing my writings, you should ponder them deeply. Take care not to conceal them, but pass them to the worthy, the gentle, and the enlightened, so they may awaken. Thus, the ancient Dao accords with the heart of Heaven and follows the intent of Earth."

There exists an ancient and great true Daoist method, which ever instructs its disciples to study the Dao, study virtue, study longevity, study goodness, study caution, study auspiciousness, study antiquity, study equilibrium, and study immortality. The reason for exhaustively expounding goodness is this: Heaven’s method ever opens the gate of the Dao; Earth’s method ever opens the door of virtue. The methods of the ancient sages ever open the path of benevolence. Thus, the ancient sages, sharing the heart of Heaven and aligning with the intent of Earth, jointly nurtured the myriad twelve thousand beings. They ever transmitted these with the intent of Dao, virtue, and benevolence, whereby the ten thousand things flourish. If transmitted with malevolent intent, all things daily decline and diminish.

Where Dao, virtue, and benevolence reside, the people daily multiply and incline toward goodness. Where Dao, virtue, and benevolence are absent, the people daily dwindle, their governance grows impoverished and bitter—this is the unchanging law of Heaven and Earth. Those who possess the heart of utmost Dao, luminous virtue, benevolence, and goodness ascend to correspond with the celestial stars and calendars, and the spirits illumine their conduct.

Thus, the ancient sages ever pondered boundless goodness, striving to the utmost so as not to harbor evil thoughts or tread the path of misfortune. The greatly foolish, their hearts ever obstructed and truly ignorant, must not be recklessly led onto the inauspicious path of decline and malevolence. They know not their great transgression against the Dao of Heaven, habitually following one another in evil, their customs so ingrained they cannot retreat.

Therefore, I reverently received the Heavenly Scriptures’ teachings and decrees, complying with Heaven’s heart to open and expand the great path of ancient Great Peace, enabling people to delight in goodness and no longer know the arts of evil. The aspirations of the people under Heaven are ever lofty, yet their accomplishments remain base, unable to fulfill their original intentions.

Thus, the superior person, indignant at death and delighting in life, studies immortality and, through diligence, attains longevity—this is the foremost among the aspiring. The middling person, aspiring yet grieving their ancestors’ early deaths, indignantly seeks the Dao to study longevity, striving to fulfill their Heaven-appointed years—this is the foremost among the resolute. Those next in rank, afflicted by frequent illness and unable to maintain equilibrium, indignantly study to halt their suffering. Through diligence, they may restore their former state, yet already slightly distressed by illness, they study to suppress it—already gravely ill. Those even lower, gravely ill and in crisis, seek Daoist arts to save themselves—already dead.

Thus, my scriptures teach people the Heavenly method of longevity, urging them to exert themselves day and night, whereby they may barely attain equilibrium. If they study only the method of equilibrium, the common person has already entered misfortune. The foolish know not that the common person’s original aspirations, ever striving for lofty goodness, cannot fulfill their intent. Thus, to elevate them highly, ascending to immortality, they may only preserve their Heaven-appointed years.

The greatly worthy, their aspirations ten out of ten fulfilled, must correspond with my Daoist scriptures. The middling worthy, their aspirations ten, may falter and slacken, attaining only five. The petty person, aspiring in the morning, forgets by evening. Thus, the greatly elevated delight in enabling the superior, middling, and inferior each to fulfill their heart’s aspirations.

Now, the people of this later age are greatly foolish, far removed from the true Dao. If they diligently study the correct Heavenly texts and methods, they may barely avoid falling into deception. If they study only the texts of equilibrium, they are already greatly deceived. If they study only elegant words and fine speech, great falsehood and treachery arise.

Heaven regards the emperor as its child and detests deception from below. When people’s conduct is rife with deceit and falsehood, the virtuous and benevolent ruler above has nothing to trust, and the common people below have nowhere to entrust their lives. If one diligently teaches and studies the true Dao day and night, they may barely attain the Dao of equilibrium. If they study only the Dao of equilibrium, they have already entered superficiality. Entering superficiality, the common person becomes greatly deluded and impoverished, thereby treading the path of great misfortune. The emperor grows sorrowful and vexed, and the people cannot be governed.

If the Perfected One wishes to know this truth, consider this analogy: a kind father and mother daily teach their child to be good, enduring hardship and denying themselves clothing and food to nurture them in old age, yet the child stubbornly persists in evil. How much more so when common people are taught with superficial and flowery texts? If they do not believe my scriptures, let those who see them reflect on their own failings.

Since the middle ancient era, those who possessed the good Dao all taught in secret, unwilling to transmit it to their disciples, instead instructing them with superficial and false texts. Through this prolonged accumulation, the Dao of Heaven has now fallen into great disorder. The calamities and prodigies of Heaven and Earth, the myriad kinds—none are without cause. The worthy and learned should deeply ponder this.

Though I do not dwell among the common people day and night, I clearly know this. The world suffers greatly, so I issue these words to instruct and entrust them—I do not act in vain. Perfected One, you must take this seriously, for Heaven’s punishment looms.

"Yes, yes. I dare not."
Whenever I hear the Heavenly Master’s words, I tremble with awe.
"Your words are correct, and Heaven will be greatly pleased and delighted, sparing you harm."
"Yes, yes."

Though one diligently studies day and night, receiving instruction in true virtue, they may barely attain the virtue of equilibrium. If they study only the virtue of equilibrium, they have already entered false and deceptive virtue. If they study false and deceptive virtue, the foolish person is already beyond reckoning. Without true virtue, they act wantonly—these are the pure destroyers of the noble person.

If one strives to study the highest benevolence, they may barely attain middling benevolence. If they study only middling benevolence, their conduct is merely equilibrium, devoid of benevolence. If they study non-benevolence, the foolish person becomes a bandit and thief, unaware of the countless killings and injuries they inflict. Acting wantonly, disregarding reason—this is the very resentment of Heaven and the blame of Earth, the great destroyer of humanity.

Those who strive day and night to study the Way of Great Auspiciousness may barely attain middling auspiciousness. If they study only middling auspiciousness, they may barely attain minor auspiciousness. If they study only minor auspiciousness, they have already entered the path of misfortune. If they study the path of misfortune, there is no longer any salvation. All are utterly benighted, knowing nothing; seeing the Way of Heaven, they call it untrue, merely deceiving and gullible. Their foolish hearts speak recklessly, disrupting the celestial patterns above and throwing the earthly principles below into chaos, bringing calamity and harm to the common people.

Thus, the scriptures of my Way are studied by all people—one must study them deeply, enabling them to ascend and join the ranks of the true immortals. If they cannot attain true immortality, they may still achieve peace, sparing the virtuous ruler from worry. True persons should deeply ponder my words and never again dismiss them in doubt."

"Indeed, indeed."

"Now, I shall discourse on behalf of Heaven, fully elucidating the responsibility of inherited burdens since the opening of Heaven and Earth. If one cannot greatly expand the methods of the Great Dao, the power of supreme virtue, the arts of longevity, and the path of supreme goodness—if people lose themselves in darkness, stubbornly clinging to their foolish and deluded hearts, gathering to do evil without restraint—then they will remain unable to comprehend the inherited transgressions and heavenly punishments of Heaven and Earth. Do you, true person, understand my words?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"Now, when sages, worthies, and lofty scholars encounter written teachings and study them, they must align perfectly with the essence of my texts, not deviating even by a hair’s breadth. Those of middling capacity, with half their intent awakened, will grasp half the truth. Those of lesser capacity, through their own effort and diligence, may still preserve the method without loss—thus does Heaven broadly raise its people.

All who delight in the teachings of the upper, middle, and lower paths without losing the method will attain the true Dao. Each will cherish themselves, daring not to treat lightly matters that bring great sorrow. The superior person, having obtained my Dao and studied it without cease, may become a state’s worthy minister. Over time, grasping its essential meaning, they may transcend the world, no longer contending in disputes or coveting power.

The middling person, studying my Dao, may become a good and upright minor official, fulfilling their allotted years. The petty person, studying my Dao, may cultivate constant reverence: fathers kind, mothers loving, children filial, elder brothers respectful, younger siblings obedient, husbands and wives in harmonious counsel, refraining from harming one another. Even unto death, no resentment lingers. Their hun and po spirits, dwelling below the earth, endure long, no longer seen to act wrongly or be called wicked offspring, nor do they suffer early death or violent demise.

In the ancient era when primordial qi first gave birth to Heaven, people all delighted in studying to become immortals, yet still could not attain longevity. At the very least, they made people fear death and avoid transgressing laws. But in this later age, people are profoundly foolish, reciting vain and florid teachings, collectively studying arts that do not prolong life. In life, they act recklessly, claiming as if they will never die, teaching one another to hold nothing dear, jointly stirring up calamities, mourning the dead with greater extravagance than celebrating life. Life belongs to Heaven, death to Earth—serving Earth in a manner that inverts Heaven is a grave harm.

By this conduct, I have observed and divined that their accumulated folly has endured so long that not one among them possesses true understanding. When misfortune arises, ghosts flourish mightily, collectively hastening to kill people, preventing them from fulfilling their Heaven-appointed destiny.

Those who strive to study the true Dao may only attain a counterfeit Dao; those who strive to cultivate true virtue may only attain a semblance of virtue. How much more so for the people of this later age, who teach one another through vain and ornate texts—how far they have strayed from the Dao! Beset by hardship and unable to restrain one another, they instead instruct each other in drafting memorials and legal codes, debating cleverly to assert superiority.

To teach them to be humane, one already fears they will not be humane—yet now they are taught to study the path of inhumanity. Heaven has bestowed laws upon humanity, calling itself the Great Dao, while Earth calls itself virtue. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things, the sovereigns of all affairs. Thus, they constantly guide with goodness, never daring to open wide the path of misfortune and evil—how much less should humans do so?

Humans are the children of Heaven and should model their conduct after it. Yet now they have lost the method, making governance difficult. To instruct them in the Dao and virtue is to enable them to know self-respect, self-cherishing, self-love, and self-governance. Instead, they are opened to the path of punishments and laws, causing them to view death as fleeting and to esteem brute strength while belittling themselves. They are made to govern one another in turn, thereby entangling and oppressing each other, reciprocally harming and plundering, heaping sorrow upon sorrow. Thus, no one in the world loves another—the great fault lies here.

Does the true person understand this? Be vigilant."

"Yes, yes."

"Now, when forcefully instructing in benevolence, even then they suffer from lack of benevolence. In later ages, people instead teach one another to study books—already a grave decline—yet their mutual hatred and resentment cannot be severed. When forcefully teaching them to seek good fortune, even then they suffer from misfortune. In later ages, people instead admonish one another to study the implements of death and mourning, preparing for misfortune in advance. They die before their time, nearly extinguishing their households, yet remain unaware of their errors and faults. When the moment comes, they cry out to Heaven and wail to Earth, calling themselves wronged, blaming the king’s governance for being unjust, claiming it has robbed them of their years and inner attainment.

The foolish do not guard their root; only when punishment is certain do they regret—yet regret is futile, for though they cry out in death, nothing can save them. Thus, I now forcefully instruct in the Great Immortal’s Daoist scriptures, merely opening the steps to longevity. When one studies virtue, one becomes benevolent; when one studies benevolence, one attains peace and security; thus, they dare not deceive or plunder others’ possessions. When one studies peace, one has already lost the method; when one studies the method, one has already lost mutual harm; when one studies mutual harm, one has already entered great conflict. Once in great conflict, the people, though innocent, are deceived, and poverty drives them to become thieves and bandits.

Therefore, following Heaven’s Daoist method, I open the gate of great fortune and close the path of misfortune and evil. I open the steps to Heaven’s great peace, so that all may recite and each be vigilant—no further governance will be needed. This allows the celestial cycles to turn smoothly, and the joyous king may wander at ease without trouble.

Thus, my writings thoroughly examine the root and origin of all matters, only then attaining their essence. Examining their essence, one has already grasped their foundation; studying those below the foolish only leads to great chaos. In this later age, though emperors and kings possess the virtue and benevolence of ten thousand people, their thoughts aligned with Heaven’s heart, misfortune does not cease. This is because the accumulated disasters and calamities of long-standing *chengfu* have piled up. Though they grieve and torment themselves, desiring to bring order to even one aspect, monstrous thieves and bandits of all kinds, and barbarians invading the Central Kingdom—these are the failures of former kings, not the fault of one person alone. One must deeply understand their root.

Thus, Heaven has sent forth my writings to absolve emperors and kings of the transgressions of *chengfu*. If the true person believes my Dao does not align with Heaven, simply follow my texts without deviating by even a fraction, and alignment will be immediate. My writings are greatly trustworthy. Without diligent practice to untie the knots of grievances, how can the Heavenly Dao silently respond?

The foolish who do not study—how can they become worthy? The poor who do not till—how can they reap? Study, and daily one becomes worthy; till, and one will surely harvest. Follow my writings, and the outcome will be the same. I guarantee it: without study, do not seek worthiness; without tilling, do not seek harvest. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"The true Dao is upright; great virtue flourishes with benevolence, and each attains their proper place. In governance and peace, nothing strays from this unity. Does the true person understand? Those who wish to repay the merit of Heaven and Earth and attain longevity must strive to trust in the Dao and never slacken."

"Yes, yes."

"Now, this foolish student wishes to ask further but dares not speak hastily."

"Speak plainly."

"By what means does the Heavenly Master discern that a person utterly lacks virtue and benevolence?"

"Excellent question. Observe their conduct and words."

"I wish to hear more."

"Very well. When one sees a person of the Dao and reacts with anger, rejecting them—this reveals a person utterly devoid of the Dao. When one sees virtue and reviles it—this reveals a person utterly devoid of virtue. When one sees benevolence and rejects it—this reveals a person utterly lacking in benevolence. When one sees goodness and vigilance and rejects them—this reveals a person who is neither vigilant nor good.

By nature: those of like minds love one another; those of differing minds hate one another. Good people also suffer from the wicked, and the wicked also suffer from the good. Does the true person understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"In ancient times, the sages and worthies, upon seeing someone, would not immediately speak with them. Instead, they keenly observed and examined their likes and dislikes to understand them. Using this as a mirror for their conduct, they never erred."

"Excellent!"

Thus the Dao shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as August Heaven; when the Way of Heaven abhors cruelty and delights in killing, to oppose it is to incur Heaven’s deepest enmity. Earth shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as virtue; when the wicked inflict harm, they commit Earth’s gravest offense. Benevolence shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as the sages and worthies; thus the sages and worthies delight in bestowing benevolence and detest plunder, making those who seize and lack benevolence the bitterest foes of the sagely and benevolent.

Therefore, the sages and worthies of old deeply understood these as the three norms governing conduct. In establishing their laws, they dared not deviate from the true Dao, virtue, or benevolence. Thus, the workings of Heaven join forces with the four seasons: when Heaven moves qi, the four seasons also move qi, acting in unison with one heart. To defy the four seasons is to incur Heaven’s enmity. Earth joins hearts and forces with the Five Phases, together nurturing all things; to harm what has not yet reached its natural end is to commit Earth’s gravest offense. The sages and worthies join hearts and forces with benevolence, thus in their travels and dwellings they ever honor the Dao and esteem virtue, relying on benevolence in their conduct. If one delights in plunder and lacks benevolence, they become the enmity and foes of the sages and worthies.

Fire corresponds to the heart, and the heart to sagacity. Fire ever dwells leaning upon wood, for wood embodies benevolence and possesses a heart. Fire bears light and can discern right from wrong; the heart is sagely and luminous. Thus the great sages of old ever dwelt leaning upon benevolence and clarity, returning to rulers of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and luminosity. Therefore, I earnestly caution: True One, entrust this book to a ruler of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and luminosity, who will surely delight in and cherish my Way, deeply comprehend its meaning, follow and emulate it, becoming no different from the divine. I do not boast to you, True One; if practiced and answered, it will surely fit like concentric circles or aligned squares, and only then will people of later ages remember my words.

"Yes, yes."

"Go now, exert yourself and strive diligently. Devote yourself to studying the Dao, virtue, and benevolence—nothing else is worth pursuing. Take this book forth; do not allow it to remain hidden."

"Yes, yes."

Here the *Illuminating the Wise and Resolving the Ignorant and Doubtful* is presented, to be consulted for decisive answers.

*Comprehensive Collated Edition of the* **Great Peace Scripture**, *Volume Fifty, Bing Section, Number Sixteen*
**Great Peace Scripture, Volume Fifty**
*Expelling Deviance and Illuminating Ancient Decisions, Chapter Sixty-Seven*

The Sixfold Perfected One, Pure and Reverent, bows twice and respectfully inquires:

"Dare I ask the August Divine Person who seeks the True: I wish to make Heaven and Earth peaceful, yin and yang undisturbed, ever proceeding in harmony, so that disasters and harms cannot arise wantonly. Yet rulers merely indulge in daily pleasures, making great amusement their constant practice. Though the questions I ask span high and low in multitude, how could they be heard repeatedly?"

"Excellent and profound! Your inquiry is most penetrating and insightful! You have precisely asked about this crucial convergence—do you wish to advance the Perfect Dao and expel deviant texts?"

"Indeed."

"Now I shall fully expound it. You have accumulated goodness before Heaven; how could I conceal it? Today, moved by your earnest goodness and thorough inquiry into the heart of the divine, if I do not speak and act, I fear I would contravene Heaven’s will. Since Heaven has indeed sent you to seek and ask, I shall explain in detail for you to follow and record—take care not to omit anything. If the emperor and kings exert themselves to employ this book, all disasters and harms will be eradicated in a single day. The world will rejoice as one, all desiring to become scholars of Dao and virtue. Later generations will follow the example of former ages; old and young will rise together, all coming to know and seek the collation of true texts. Superficial embellishments will vanish. Hearts will thoroughly harmonize with the divine spirits; the ruler will have no single worry—why should he not indulge in daily pleasures?

Thus, all matters under Heaven and Earth will each attain their proper place. The hundred spirits will rejoice in consequence, and the ruler will deeply align with Heaven’s will. The Perfect Dao will come to assist him, so that only auspicious days remain, with not a single inauspicious event. My words are utterly sincere and unfailing. The only fear is that, having obtained them, they are not practiced. When the multitude of deviations congeal, disasters, anomalies, and superficial embellishments become the great illnesses of Heaven, Earth, yin, and yang. If a great illness is left untreated, how can it be resolved and cured? Since you have come to inquire about these matters, speaking on Heaven’s behalf, carefully ponder the words above and below in this book. Should there be the utmost sincerity, take care not to disorder them."

"Understood."

"Once you return to a suitable place, day and night reflect upon it. Having received and recorded it, repeatedly elucidate and annotate it, hoping it may endure for ten thousand generations without end. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, speech, writing, and texts have followed one another in succession. Those of the same qi illuminate one another by kind; seeking their kind and gathering them, the Dao daily becomes more manifest, without any time of decline. Thus, from ancient times to the present, all sages have together discoursed for Heaven, all worthies have shared their words, and all have jointly devised sagely plans for emperors and kings—they are Heaven’s noble children. Children inheriting their fathers’ teachings should follow and practice them, thereby removing the worries of Heaven and Earth and thus obtaining their protection. Hence, they constantly think and strive to practice them.

Why should my Dao cease? When encountering matters, one should awaken. If one does not awaken to the divine spirits of Heaven and Earth, one must further seek in countless, myriad, thousandfold, hundredfold, tenfold, and single instances—all matters must correspond before they can be deemed reliable. If they do not correspond, urgently seek again. Among their analogous counterparts, if even one corresponds without fail, that is it. All matters should be thus. How can one thoroughly know their correspondence? Correspondence means inwardly examining the heart and outwardly aligning with the spirits and deities, moving in resonance near and far. When divining matters and verifying them below, the responsive ones are correct; the unresponsive ones are all false. Be cautious and do not speak recklessly, lest you leave no legacy for later generations.

The reason is this: reckless speech and false words leave no legacy and cannot be used for long, hence leaving no legacy for people. As the governance of the Dao declines, perverse and contrary words proliferate—these are truly incorrect. They all disrupt the celestial patterns and terrestrial principles, failing to align with the hearts of sages, and the spirits cannot be employed. Therefore, speech should first be inwardly examined in human sentiment and the heart, and only then can it outwardly harmonize and thoroughly align with the spirits and deities. This is how to grasp success and failure—the warning of celestial patterns.

Accumulate texts by kind to follow one another, gathering the multitude of worthies to compile them. Select from them those where ten correspond to ten, aligning with the hearts of people and the spirits and deities, to form texts that together settle their intent. Test them by verification below—only thus can they be unalterable for ten thousand generations. Verification means that when divining matters, the response is accurate, and when practiced, the response is realized. Only then can they be used to establish the celestial canon and law. This is precisely the great art of regulating and stabilizing yin and yang, bringing peace to the ruler. This can transform misfortune into fortune, making the people live longer—why is this so?

When celestial patterns and terrestrial principles are correct, yin and yang each attain their proper place. When yin and yang each attain their proper place, the spirits and deities all greatly rejoice. When the spirits and deities rejoice, they protect the people. Thus, the emperor and kings enjoy long peace, and the people live long—how can one not strive diligently?

The *Flying Illumination* is the lesser of the Three Luminaries, all connected below the earth and suspended above in the heavens. Their movements harmonize with the people, creatures, and all things on earth—this is the evidence of essential texts. When the texts and divinations of these books correspond in hundreds and tens, that is correct; those that do not correspond and harmonize are false. Using this to measure and balance, all deviant texts and books will be entirely eradicated.

Examine past events to verify present ones. Follow what Heaven permits, observe what Heaven may initiate, do not disrupt celestial patterns, and join forces with Heaven—this may be called perpetual auspiciousness. Heaven can only be followed, not opposed. Seize what is advantageous and benefit from it, and the people will flourish. Opposing it causes the people to decline, losing Heaven’s will and intent."

*Testing Correspondence by Shifting Categories, Divination Decisions, Chapter Sixty-Eight*

All texts of shifting categories and moving patterns are celestial writings, where yin and yang intersect and the celestial patterns are completed. Emperors, kings, the people, and the myriad things all proceed according to their principles; those who grasp their intent attain auspiciousness, while those who lose their intent encounter misfortune. Matters have their reversals and sequences—one cannot but scrutinize them carefully and in detail.

To ascertain their authenticity, test them with twenty-five matters of fivefold correspondence: select twenty-five past events and twenty-five families of practitioners, meticulously recording the years, months, days, and hours from which they originate, and to which of the five notes each belongs. By divining fortune and misfortune, verify that hundreds and tens correspond—this is the proof. Such scrutiny secures the proper division of Heaven and Earth, leaving no doubt for the ruler. Ministers and the people do not lose their roles, and the myriad things each find their place. If they do not conform to the words of this text, they are chaotic and deviant writings and must not be used. When measured and balanced thus, those texts that mislead people—should anyone dare employ them—will leave their users childless in later generations. The reason is this: they harm the people and disrupt the divisions of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth preside over life, yet humans invert their yin and yang, hence causing their descendants to perish.

In ancient times, before such texts existed, Heaven reversed its course. After the emergence of celestial writings, all understood the intent of the Dao of Heaven. Those who deliberately violated it died early or met misfortune—this is the principle. When applied, kin align by category, resonating in harmony; the Five Peaks and ten thousand *li* respond to one another. Through concentrated and detailed contemplation, matters of goodness align with goodness, and the base harmonize with the base. In their multitude or paucity, elevation or lowness, not a single instance is amiss.

Regularly test with the twenty-five *qi* of fivefold correspondence, which manifest as twenty-five families and twenty-five hills. When texts correspond in hundreds and tens, they are earthly prophecies. Compare their *qi*: those that align are sibling lands, where the people share the same likes and dislikes. Moreover, all manner of birds, beasts, grasses, and trees of the same kind belong to lands of shared *qi*. By this clarity, the correspondence of lands is confirmed. Where lands are not sibling by water and *qi*, their fish and turtles remain of the same kind. Using this for divination and distinguishing their origins, the affairs of the myriad things can all be known. Those with identical images share identical forms; those with differing images have differing forms—right and wrong are precisely thus.

*Cinnabar Radiance and the Repulsion of Deviance, Chapter Sixty-Nine*
"Cinnabar Radiance" refers to the celestial script of engravings, which can rectify errors and repel deviance. Those that correspond in tens and bring healing are celestial texts, aligning with true divine officials—this is the efficacy of past events. Those that correspond in nineteens and bring healing are earthly texts, harmonizing with yin spirits. Those that correspond in eighteens and bring healing are the balanced texts of humanity. Tested thus, all others are deviant texts and must not be used. These are the writings that repel deviance, for they must correspond with the divine. Those that do not heal mislead people and cannot save the dying.

Some texts, though authored by spirits and gods and bringing healing when applied, remain unknowable in origin—such a person’s fate and official position are long in deviance, and others cannot employ their writings. Should such texts be gathered and engraved en masse, are they not deviant? They may be carved and banished to uninhabited wilds. These texts must be sought one by one and cannot be obtained hastily.

*Formulas of Grasses and Trees, Chapter Seventy*
Grasses and trees possessing virtue and the Dao, with official positions, can be commanded—these are called "formulas of grasses and trees," referring to spirit grasses and trees. Those that heal upon application are celestial spirit grasses and trees, growing below yet dwelling on earth. Those that extend life are celestial immortal grasses and trees, growing below yet dwelling on earth. Those that heal upon recitation of formulas are called "immediate-healing formulas"; those that heal in a single day are called "one-day healing formulas." When hundreds and tens correspond in healing, this is the proof.

These grasses and trees possess spirit and can be commanded, being grasses and trees with official positions. Those that heal with tenfold correspondence are the grasses of emperors and kings; those with nineteenfold correspondence are the grasses of great ministers; those with eighteenfold correspondence are the grasses of the people. Those below this standard must not be used, for they are grasses that mislead people. This is the art of saving life and death—one cannot but scrutinize it carefully.

Formulas that heal upon combination are recorded by their grasses and trees as "immediate-healing formulas"; those that heal in one day are "one-day healing formulas"; those that heal in two days are "two-day formulas"; those that heal in three days are "three-day formulas." One-day healing formulas are administered by celestial spirits; two-day healing formulas by earthly spirits; three-day healing formulas by human ghosts. Those that do not conform to this are not celestial spirit formulas but merely heal through the natural properties of grasses—whether they heal or not, they are called "death-awaiting formulas." Be cautious, be cautious. This is the art of saving lives—it cannot be taken lightly, and matters cannot but be scrutinized in detail.

*Formulas of Living Beings, Chapter Seventy-One*
Living beings that act with essence—such as flying, walking, and crawling creatures—can heal diseases. Birds carry celestial divine medicines within their bodies, Heaven having made them round or square in movement. Those that heal with tenfold correspondence contain celestial spirit formulas within; those that heal with nineteenfold correspondence contain earthly essence formulas within; those that heal with eighteenfold correspondence contain the balanced divine medicines of human essence within. These three are the formulas that traverse yin and yang in the harmony of Heaven and Earth, called "healing envoys." They are like humans of the Dao who are titled envoys—divine persons and divine masters.

When commanded by the essences of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and ghosts, and healing with hundredfold and tenfold correspondence, they are the divine formulas of emperors and supreme sovereigns. Those that heal with nineteenfold correspondence are the divine formulas of kings and marquises; those that heal with eighteenfold correspondence are the divine formulas of great ministers, commoners, and reclusive scholars of utmost virtue.

Each emerges for its specific purpose, and by observing these signs, one will never err even once.

These three kinds of formulas all employ the divine medicines of Heaven, Earth, and humanity to heal illness. Heaven commands each to receive the mandate of their ancestors and embody their innate arts, from which they cannot depart. This is like the phoenix and qilin, whose bodies bear virtue; or like bees and scorpions, whose bodies bear venom—such is the meaning here.

One must deeply understand the essential intent of the Dao of Heaven to truly comprehend the nature of the Dao of Heaven, thereby benefiting the governance of emperors and kings and preventing people from falling into confusion. Without knowing the essential texts, one might claim that all writings under Heaven can be used. Thus, those that correspond to seventeen or fewer are deemed heterodox, failing to align with the three auspicious signs, and their harm runs deep.

Therefore, those who heal only one out of ten injuries do not accord with the intent of Heaven; those who heal two out of ten do not accord with the intent of Earth; those who heal three out of ten do not accord with the intent of humanity. Those who heal six or seven out of ten or fewer bring about chaotic governance. Yin and yang become discordant, and spirits and deities engage in strife.

Thus, the sage kings and supreme rulers of antiquity, though dwelling in secluded chambers, deeply pondered the intent of Heaven to preserve themselves and attain long life. My writings, with their interconnected phrases above and below, form a coherent text. The wise and discerning read them to complement one another, thereby rescuing the lost and confused, ensuring people enjoy prolonged fortune and avoid misfortune. Each should reflect morning and night on these essential meanings to preserve their well-being.

The children’s songs and poems sung by the people of past and present arise when Heaven’s transformations stir them to speech. Sacred texts emerge at times when Heaven conveys its discourse, entrusting it to those of utmost virtue to remedy the world’s errors.

The Dao of Heaven abhors killing and cherishes life; even the tiniest creeping creatures possess awareness. Do not lightly kill or harm them. If transformation is necessary to accomplish a task, use them only when unavoidable.

All things flourish under Heaven, their lives bound to it, their roots in Earth, and their proper use dependent on humanity. Those who accord with Heaven’s intent live long; those who lose it perish. All things exist in harmony with Heaven and Earth, with humanity as their sovereign. Those who rule as sovereigns over humanity must be meticulous and thorough.

**Discarding Florid Explanations, Chapter Seventy-Two**

To grasp the meaning of all Daoist texts and scriptures, focus on each character as a complete unit. For example, what is *jiazi*? Place it before you, and let one person expound its fundamental meaning while a gathering of the wise debate and discuss it. Some may excel in the intent of celestial patterns, expounding upward to thoroughly explore the Dao of Heaven. Others may excel in terrestrial principles, expounding downward to thoroughly explore the Dao of Earth. Still others may excel in the external and peripheral, thoroughly exploring the four directions; or in seated discourse, thoroughly exploring the center; or in tracing origins, excelling in the essence of the myriad things, thoroughly exploring them. Some explore the internal, others the external—roots, branches, stems, and leaves all become apparent, and each is named according to its category and image.

Scriptures record the essential intent of all matters, the patterns of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, which can be glimpsed in outline. When head and foot are complete, upper and lower connected, and the categories of things follow their nature, their meanings are harmoniously settled. Each records its discourse, and the finest are compiled into a single explanation.

Thus, the sage seeks to grasp the intent of the Dao of Heaven to regulate and stabilize yin and yang, bringing peace to the ruler and the world, so that all spirits rejoice. Therefore, they gather the wisdom of the many to establish enduring laws, unchanging for ten thousand generations.

The reason the intent of the Dao of Heaven is lost today is that the words of a single wise person, though insightful in one aspect, cannot encompass all. Their vision is incomplete, unable to flow through the six directions or thoroughly explore the seven realms within and without, nor can they trace the essence of the myriad things. Thus, their explanations diverge, causing the original texts of Heaven’s scriptures to lose their foundation, leading to confusion and error—this is the very cause.

In all matters to be rectified, each has its root that can be exhaustively explored. Yin and yang do not change; all should follow this principle. Otherwise, it is called isolated speech or solitary discourse, failing to grasp the scriptural intent. Following the words of one person alone is called partial speech.

The nature of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully understood by anyone but a sage. Thus, when expounding, if one cannot thoroughly explore the intent of Heaven within or resolve the patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth without, their divinations will miss the mark, spirits will not heed their commands, and they will lose the correct path, falling into confusion and disorder. This is called pursuing the florid and failing to grasp the root’s essential intent. The error lies here, causing the unadorned to lose their foundation.

When the Dao of Heaven loses its correctness, yin and yang internally become afflicted, discord and harm arise from the qi, emperors and kings grow anxious, their hearts unable to restrain it. Transformative qi arises in succession, people’s lifespans shorten, and this is deemed a great fault. The wise and discerning together lose the intent of Heaven.

As the legacy of the sages fades over time, people can no longer grasp its principles—this is called a disordered Dao. The reason lies in the fact that all scriptures and records of the Dao, though interwoven before and after, speak of Heaven and Earth.

The head of all matters is the root of the spirits and deities. Thus, those who grasp the original intent will find that spirits and deities no longer engage in strife or harm humanity. Evil qi is sealed away, banditry ceases, and when bandits and thieves are stopped, the barbarians retreat and submit. Wind and rain arrive in their proper seasons—this is the clear effect of Heaven’s joy.

When Heaven is pleased, it loves its children. Thus, the emperor’s lifespan is extended, his blessings flow to the people, reaching even the six domestic animals, birds, and beasts, thoroughly pervading grasses and trees. Harmonious qi appears everywhere, evil qi vanishes, and the correct qi shines ever brighter—this is the natural method of yin and yang.

It is like the day being for activity and the night for rest; when petty people flee, the noble advance. Reflect deeply on these words, for they benefit life, clearly distinguishing yin and yang and expounding on the spirits.

If you believe my writings to be untrue, test the Dao to see its success, and thereby discern their merits and flaws. Now, let us transcribe one copy and present it before you, allowing all worthy scholars to dispute and expound upon it. Yet when their intentions diverge and their explanations differ, it becomes clear that the words of a single person are not enlightened—how then can they govern yin and yang, enabling the ruler to wander carefree in joy?

Thus, those who grasp the root are few, while those who expound are many, and nothing will not fall into confusion. If those who grasp the root are many and those who expound are few, the Dao daily grows shallow and superficial. If shallowness persists unchecked, disorder arises; if disorder persists unchecked, yin and yang turn malign, and evil qi arises. Therefore, the sage-kings must esteem the root, and the noble person must rectify the beginning—then nothing will not be ordered.

If the root is not esteemed nor the beginning rectified, all affairs lose their discipline, the myriad things fall into chaos, and order cannot be restored. Refine and clarify it, and deluded teachings and heterodox texts will depart.

**Heavenly Patterns, Secret Formulas: Chapter Seventy-Three**

Heaven and Earth possess constant laws, not erring by even a fraction. Far and near all share the same images; qi of the same kind resonate, never failing in even one instance. This is called the *Record of Heavenly Patterns*, also named the *Heavenly Book*.

Billions, millions, thousands, hundreds, tens—whether twelve days complete a cycle, twelve years complete a cycle, sixty years complete a cycle, or one hundred twenty years complete a cycle, it is the same. Whether billions of cycles align, or ten thousand, or a thousand, or a hundred, or ten, all are like the *jiazi* cycle. Though their qi differs, their affairs differ, their words differ, and their songs and poems differ, though all are *jiazi*, the qi has not yet completed its cycle—hence the differences.

By categorizing their images and naming them, good and evil share the same qi, same words, and same affairs to form one cycle. Carefully examining and uniting these reveals the past and illuminates the present; knowing the present, one repeatedly clarifies the past. This is how one knows the constant movements of Heaven, penetrating and illuminating the principles of yin and yang.

If the text’s words are mistaken or out of order, they should be supplemented by one another. When songs, sounds, and affairs align, this is called the great cycle, the middle cycle, and the small cycle. Grasping their meaning and ordering their affairs to harmonize yin and yang and pacify the ruler—this is how one emulates the constant laws of Heaven’s texts.

It is like spring, autumn, winter, and summer, which never err. Yet later generations all lack sufficient lifespan and have not witnessed a single full cycle—how then can they know the three cycles of great, middle, and small? Is the ancient constant Dao divine?

Thus, they lose the correct path. Glimpsing only a fleeting moment and failing to thoroughly understand the divine texts of past and present, they follow partial words and claim them as truth. It is like a child born in spring who dies before autumn, never witnessing its affairs; or one born in summer who perishes before winter, never seeing its events. Those who expound see only what lies before their eyes, and even with ten debates, they remain ignorant, for this is not the case.

If the patterns of Heaven do not manifest, it is precisely because of this. Thus, affairs do not appear without cause; there are always texts of order and chaos. The Dao does not emerge without reason; the times and fate decree it. Therefore, the works of ancient poets all flow from Heaven’s qi, ensuring their words are not empty.

Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity, perceiving the subtle and knowing the manifest, acted in accordance with their tasks, following the qi and thereby attaining Heaven’s will—hence their long prosperity. To go against it brings floods and droughts, qi in discord and opposition, accumulating disasters into unceasing calamities and omens, called *disasters and anomalies*. Many worthy scholars are bewildered, unaware that these arise from defying the qi and not aligning with the times—how can one not be deeply cautious?

If the patterns of Heaven do not manifest, it is because the times have order and chaos, and the Dao does not emerge without reason. The ancient sage-kings, perceiving the subtle and knowing the manifest, acted in accordance with their tasks, following the qi and thereby attaining Heaven’s will, like enduring good fortune. To go against it brings floods and droughts, qi in discord and opposition, accumulating disasters into unceasing calamities and omens, called *disasters and anomalies*. Many worthy scholars are bewildered, unaware of the Dao of compliance and defiance.

Heaven causes later generations to have records because those born earlier understand longevity and the natural Way, entering the Dao of emptiness and tranquility. Thus, they know the cyclical completion of Heaven’s intent, like the constancy of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Later generations, their qi long dissipated, their learning shallow, grow distant from the essential texts of the Dao, forgetting the teachings of former times. Unless one is a divine sage, one cannot foresee the completion of cycles. Therefore, Heaven repeatedly generates texts and records, transmitting them across generations, so they may be mutually referenced and enjoyed, desiring that they awaken understanding for self-preservation.

When encountering great peace, one may govern while resting at ease; when encountering moderate peace, one may act with effort.

When encountering disorder, one may rely on the Dao to support and prepare oneself. This is like preparing for heat at the summer solstice and for cold at the winter solstice—such is the meaning. The Way of Heaven moves in constant cycles, not favoring any particular person. Thus, following it brings prosperity and flourishing, while opposing it leads to peril and ruin.

When the Way of Heaven engages in struggle, its mandate is harmed; the sun and moon lose their proper measure, and the constellations move in disorder. Knowing to follow the seasonal qi, the sun and moon maintain their measure, and the constellations move in harmony—this is the clear evidence of Heaven. Those who can apply this do so through their own effort, daring not to conceal or hoard, and taking care not to inflict harm.

The secret books of Heaven are bestowed upon the benevolent and worthy, illuminating high and low, enabling self-preservation.

**Moxibustion and Acupuncture, Chapter Seventy-Four**

Moxibustion and acupuncture serve to regulate and harmonize the three hundred and sixty meridians, unblocking the qi of yin and yang to eliminate harm. The three hundred and sixty meridians correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of a year, with each meridian governing its day, moving in accord with the four seasons and the five phases, circulating externally throughout the body and converging at the crown of the head, while internally connecting to the organs.

Their decline and flourishing shift with the four seasons; when illness arises, they fail to correspond, their cycles of coming and going lose regularity, becoming knotted or injured, flowing in accord or opposition—thus, they must be treated. Moxibustion is the essence of greater yang, the clarity of impartial justice, used to examine and eliminate evil and harm. Acupuncture is the essence of lesser yin, the radiance of Venus, employed with righteousness to cut and subdue.

When treatment is effective in a hundred out of a hundred cases, or ten out of ten, this aligns with the celestial meridian prognostic texts, truly corresponding to the meridians, with spirit as its agent. When nine out of ten are cured and one is not, it corresponds to the yin meridians, with essence as its agent. When eight out of ten are cured, it is a human method, with human intention as its agent. Beyond this, it cannot cure illness and may instead harm the spirit.

Treating the *jia* meridian for a disease in the *yi* meridian is called confusion, failing to recognize the meridian’s unique injury and severance. Therefore, to discern whether the celestial Way is spiritually efficacious or not, whether it corresponds or not, simply place a patient before you—this is the meridian’s foundational text, akin to the foundational text of the Daoist scriptures.

Gather many worthy individuals to discuss the illness; some may excel in the upper body, others in the lower, and each of the three hundred and sixty meridians has its observable aspects. Record the methods of those who excel in treatment, focusing on those whose success rate is ten out of ten—those who fail are not reliable. Compile the collective methods of those who succeed, and use the cures as scriptural texts; thus, no treatment will remain unresolved.

---

The Way of Heaven governs the meridians, whether externally or internally, and cannot be fully known. Where treatment is effective in ten out of ten cases, that is the meeting point of the meridians. People vary in size, their measurements differing, yet the degrees are the same; only by dividing according to the cavities and principles can correspondence be achieved.

Daoist texts, accumulated over time, vary in their teachings, creating what is called chaotic meridians. If yang meridians are unbalanced yet yin meridians are treated instead, people suffer misfortune, harming the innocent and shortening lives. The meridians correspond to Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, rising with the qi and cycling back to their origin.

Those who grasp these principles use them to cultivate their nature, knowing whether the seasonal qi has arrived or not, and pacifying any imbalances. The sages of antiquity sat in pure tranquility, holding their own pulses, observing the cycles of coming and going, and from any irregularity, they knew the gains and losses of the four seasons and five phases, thereby understanding the decline and flourishing of their own bodies. This is how they pacified the state, nurtured life, and preserved their allotted span—how could one not be cautious!

People, deluded, follow indiscriminate moxibustion and acupuncture, injuring the correct meridians and harming the upright qi, disrupting the four seasons and five phases, bringing forth calamities and anomalies. Great persons suffer greatly, lesser persons suffer less, and all may be moved or unsettled from their places—this is the natural course of things. Thus, the ancient sages and divine emperors valued this greatly, residing in their places, observing the movements of the meridians to prognosticate the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of the six directions. This is what is meant by knowing the distant through the near, and the external through the internal—hence, it is the essential and divine Way.

**Divine Incantations, Chapter Seventy-Five**

In Heaven, there are constant divine and sagely essential words, occasionally bestowed upon people as speech, employing divine officials who respond to the qi and come and go. The people who receive them call them divine incantations.

An incantation that cures a hundred out of a hundred, or ten out of ten, is the transmission of the foundational text of the celestial scriptures. Such incantations can summon spirits to eliminate illness, and when all are effective in ten out of ten cases, there is no illness they cannot cure in the direction they are applied.

---

Merely speaking to cure illness—these are the divine prognostic words of Heaven. They are what good teachers and emperors should employ, compiled into scrolls and named the *Book of Incantation Prognostics*. These are used to summon the host of spirits, hence their tenfold efficacy.

When nine out of ten are cured, the true spirits do not arrive; the intermediate spirits do, and these are the domain of great ministers. When eight out of ten are cured, human spirits arrive, and these are the domain of those who govern the people. These are the words of the celestial spirits, originally meant to summon spirits. Their names and times occasionally leak down to earth, and Daoist practitioners, having learned of them, transmit them to one another, enabling the treatment of illness. Like sending a messenger with words, they cannot cure illness.

In matters of change, one cannot rely on others even for a moment. Heaven values human life, fearing that rare remedies are difficult to complete in haste, and that great physicians may lose the meridian scriptures, failing to comprehend matters of life and death. Thus, it places essential methods in people’s mouths—this is the art of emergency relief.

To obtain these essential words, simply place a patient before you as the foundational text of the incantation, and have each person recite the secret words from their mouths. If the illness is immediately cured, it is genuine; if not, it is entirely false, mere deceptive and reckless speech, not to be taken as a model.

Some may use incantations to cure alone, yet others applying the same fail to achieve results—such words cannot be recorded. These are the leaders of ghosts and spirits, naturally employed by people, called "solitary words," not the true Dao of summoning divine beings. Though humans are distant from heaven, how can one discern the authenticity of the Way? That which is true will harmonize and respond, fitting like tally tokens; what does not is false.

**Burial and Residence, Chapter Seventy-Six**
Burial is the original hillside dwelling of ancestors, called the "initial planting of roots." A residence is the earth where the hun-souls return to nurture descendants; a good site allows the hun-souls to return and nourish, while a bad one causes them to return and harm. When the qi of the Five Ancestors ends, it reverts to become human again. The Dao of heaven follows qi, cycling back to its origin.

To test the efficacy of a site, plant a small, lowly seed in the earth: if later days bring flourishing growth, it is a greatly generative site; if a fine seed is planted yet later days bring ill fortune, it is a contrary site; if days wane and diminish, it is a consumptive site. Test with twenty-five families’ burial mounds: if ten, a hundred, or a thousand correspond, it is the *Earth’s Hidden Treasure Scripture*; if nineteen correspond, it is the *Earth’s Hidden Treasure Record*; if eighteen correspond, it is the *Disordered Earth Scripture*, not to be used regularly; anything below this is heterodox writing, harmful texts of the common folk.

To verify its accuracy, record past events and test against future ones—only then can truth and falsehood be distinguished. Know that my writings are like heaven’s *jia* and earth’s *yi*, immutable for ten thousand generations. The testing of root matters where humans dwell must not be treated lightly. Once a matter is settled, relying on heterodox texts brings harm, causing disasters and misfortunes to arise frequently, bringing great suffering to the worthy and the people.

Thus, whether noble or humble, those who wish to transmit knowledge to descendants must carefully examine the correctness of burial sites, understand their principles, and divine future events. Take twenty-five burial mounds as the foundational text, compare them with past events, record outcomes to test the present, and use past evidence to inform the future. True masters should thoroughly ponder the text’s upper and lower sections to dispel confusion—this is called the *Yin Concealment Divination Text*, which reveals ancestors and benefits later generations, to be transmitted for ten thousand generations. Take care never to conceal it.

**Discerning the Authenticity of Ancient Texts, Chapter Seventy-Seven**
All music serves to convey sound and transform the qi of the six directions and eight extremities. When its tones harmonize, responses come in accord with goodness; when they do not, responses arrive in conflict and opposition. Sounds each have their own affiliations—east, west, south, north, *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*—the twenty-five qi each have their own domains. At times, sounds gather and form coherent phrases, thus revealing their nature.

By listening to sounds, one discerns subtle words, divines fortune or misfortune, and when the raised tone aligns with the *Blowing-Hair Pitch-Pipe*, one knows the stringed sounds—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, *yu*—distinguishing the six directions’ distances and naming their good or ill. Only the refined can perceive the spirit’s response to affairs.

Thus, the sages of antiquity regulated music to move all things, harmonize yin and yang, and stabilize the four seasons and five phases. When yin and yang are balanced, their sounds are pleasant to hear; when yin and yang are disharmonious, discordant and chaotic, their sounds are difficult to bear. Strings must also be tuned: one should use the nine-nines method, ordering the silk strings so that high and low tones harmonize, reflecting upon them without harming the viscera’s spirit. If untuned, the dance becomes disordered, lacking proper sound, unbearable to hear, and injurious to the viscera’s spirit. Thus, divine omens and auspicious responses do not arrive.

Only those who are capable and skilled in sound can harmonize and transform yin and yang. How does one know this? When the numinous and bright respond, auspicious omens and beings gather—this is the person. Otherwise, all is chaotic sound, unable to move or summon, and thus no response comes.

Therefore, in all matters, one must find the right person—like a spirit. Without the right person, it is like reckless speech. With the right person, matters great or small can all be accomplished; without them, nothing can be done. Thus, the ancient sages valued actions and sought the worthy, leaving no obscurity, becoming models for antiquity. With the right person, there is order; without them, chaos.

Ancient texts are too numerous to record in full. Use one matter to analogize ten, ten to analogize a hundred, a hundred to analogize a thousand, a thousand to analogize ten thousand, ten thousand to analogize a hundred million, a hundred million to analogize the boundless. Matters each have their own categories and affiliations. Place their foundational texts before one, so that the knowledgeable may grasp the root, and those skilled in application may expound upon them. Observe their harmonious responses: what aligns and fits is true; what does not respond or fit is entirely false.

To discern whether the writings of the ancient sages truly embody the Dao, this is like calling a person: those who know their surname and given name will respond. Ghosts and spirits are the same—they do not respond without the correct name. Though one may wish for harmony, there is no means to reach them, and thus no response comes.

Thus, the ancients called learning "pursuing essence." Essence means to focus intently on the image of the matter and appropriately reconsider its words. Exhaustively ponder these writings, and all matters will be complete. The texts above and below are numerous, each with its own subject—one should read them carefully, supplementing one with another, to fully grasp their meaning. Without deeply understanding their essential meaning, words of the Dao are ineffective, and one cannot resolve the conflicts of yin and yang.

My writings are for the benevolent and worthy, to be passed on to those with virtue. Those with virtue who receive them should treasure them. If one receives them but cannot read them well, dismissing them as not the Dao, they cannot bring joy to their person or avert calamities.

When the great Dao is about to manifest, does it not seem flavorless?

Shall its use ever be exhausted? When all worthy ones trace its origins, can they not harmonize hardness and softness, exhaust the positions of yin and yang? Once all texts and writings are fully settled, each finding its proper place, will confusion not cease? All evils having departed, the Supreme Lord rejoices greatly, and the people are free from misfortune. Does its beneficence not extend to the smallest and most subtle, all things teeming and bustling without losing their qi? Do they not return to the Great Beginning, the positions of Heaven and Earth established? With perverse texts vanished, is the primordial qi not preserved?

The One is the warp of the Dao;
The Two is its weft in motion;
The Three is already chaos—
no clarity remains.

〈Rising〉
My Dao begins with *jiazi* and *yichou*,
the six *jia* cycles succeeding one another.
The Five Phases turn in mutual accord,
the four seasons revolving to their origin.
Though the scrolls are many,
each has its own record.
Like the human body,
head and feet move in concert.
One word departs, another arises in its place—
the worthy order them to complement one another.
Unite yin and yang in speech,
inner and outer responding like compass and square.
At first recitation, it seems flavorless,
but with long and unbroken practice,
the proof of its truth will manifest.
Disasters depart from the body, spirits return in assembly,
people naturally become prudent and good, free from evil—
this is called the absence of punishment,
the perfection of Dao-transformations.

Examine my texts to avert misfortune:
treachery and calamity cease of themselves, the people live long.
Trace back to the origin—there is no end or beginning.

Ten matching ten: the text of Great Yang;
nineteen matching nineteen: the text of Great Yin;
eighteen matching eighteen: the text of Central Harmony;
seventeen matching seventeen: the text of Ruin and Chaos;
sixteen matching sixteen: the text of Encountering the Central Writ;
fifteen matching fifteen: the text of Ignorance—
this may be called the text of half-fortune, half-misfortune;
fourteen matching fourteen: the perverse text;
thirteen matching thirteen: the text of Great Chaos;
twelve matching twelve: the discarded text;
eleven matching eleven: the alternating text;
ten matching ten and below: unusable,
texts that lead people astray.
The harm they inflict varies in degree,
but in the end, they bring harm to people.
If used without cease for long,
the law is severed, posterity extinguished, the family destroyed—
this is the text of ten matching ten.

**Tai Ping Jing Collated and Combined, Scroll Fifty-One, Bing Section Seventeen**
**Tai Ping Jing, Scroll Fifty-One**
**Collated Texts on the Methods of Rectifying the Perverse, Chapter Seventy-Eight**

Pure prostrates in trembling reverence, bowing twice.

**"What further would you inquire?"**
**"Pure has now beheld the true and numerous texts of the enlightened master—these are the discourses of Heaven. Yet I fear [lacuna] and shock, unaware of what should come first or last. By what means may one truly rectify and obtain these texts?"**

**"If you delight in attaining their truth, simply observe the sacred words of the high antiquity, the sacred words of the middle antiquity, and the sacred words of the lower antiquity. Examine their utterances and behold their deeds—thus may it be known. Further, observe the Daoist texts of high antiquity, the Daoist texts of middle antiquity, and the Daoist texts of lower antiquity. When these three are united by like kind calling to like, it may again be known."**

**"Now, all texts and writings are discourses of Heaven—why then do they bring order at times and chaos at others, never equilibrium? I wish to hear of this."**

**"Indeed, to rectify their words and clarify their texts is to bring order; to fail in rectification and clarity is to bring chaos. Upright speech and meticulous discourse must lead to goodness; perverse speech and inauspicious discourse must lead to evil. Now, your ceaseless questioning shows your desire to know and to attain goodness. To achieve this, simply rectify the root. When the root is upright, it aligns with the patterns of Heaven and accords with the sacred words. Turning once more, it aligns with the principles of Earth; turning thrice, it becomes the patterns of humanity; turning fourfold, it becomes the patterns of the myriad things. Yet when the myriad things generate superficial flourishes, such flourishes bring chaos and ruin.**

**The celestial patterns and sacred texts emerge in their time to examine the primordial and correct the beginning, removing errors and establishing truth. To clarify and order all texts is the Dao of Heaven. Those who grasp upright speech align with the heart-mind of Heaven. Perverse speech brings perverse and malign qi, causing Heaven and Earth to fall out of harmony. The myriad things lose their proper places, and the emperor’s heart-mind is beset with sorrow and suffering. Chaos arises once more—thus, one must urgently examine and rectify these texts.**

**From antiquity to the present, all texts and writings are already complete. Yet we lament that they are gathered together without purity, jumbled in confusion. This causes the worthy and enlightened to share in doubt and delusion, uncertain of what to follow or trust. Thus, the utmost sincerity of Heaven is lost, and each follows their own contrary path. They drift far from the subtle words and great intentions of the Heavenly Dao, all becoming perverse speech and perverse texts. Such texts, being perverse, fail to rectify yin and yang. Disasters arise in succession, and the fault lies herein.**

**Seeing your earnest questioning, I cannot bear it and thus expound these matters repeatedly for you. Swiftly record my words and ponder them deeply. For in all matters, to obtain something yet fail to practice it single-mindedly is of no benefit. If one can practice it, great calamities may be averted."**

**"When the celestial patterns are in chaos, and one desires to see order restored—is this not like a person gravely ill, longing for healing? How may this be achieved?"**

**"Ah, are you truly so ignorant? A grave illness left untreated leads to death; celestial patterns left unrectified lead to great chaos. The four seasons lose their qi, the Five Phases turn against one another in strife, the Three Luminaries lack proper brightness, all deviating from their true paths—thus do they bring ruin. The people are thrown into turmoil, all losing their dwellings. The old and weak bear burdens, half perishing prematurely. The state is plunged into darkness and confusion. The supreme Dao and virtuous power are severed, the worthy are concealed and cannot aid one another—is this not a grave illness indeed? Thus, one must strive to rectify it.**

**Now, the foolish daily study superficial and floating texts, each contradicting the other to vie for superiority, unaware of the great harm they cause, dismissing it as a trifling matter. How could they know that within, it is a grave illness for yin and yang and Heaven and Earth? That the world cannot be governed and rectified stems precisely from this. The spirits and deities suffer affliction, which is why they have sent you to question me repeatedly. You must examine these texts day and night, deeply contemplating their essential meaning. Do not treat this lightly, for it is not a matter to be taken lightly by the August Heaven. Now, the emperor has no refuge for his heart-mind—his fault is grave indeed.**

**Though I now speak with you alone, this is no trifling matter. Within, I speak to rectify the words and judgments of the August Heaven. I dare not utter empty or reckless speech, for the fault would rest upon me, heavy and inescapable. The punishments of spirits and deities cannot be evaded or fled like those of mortals. Do not dare to follow my light words as if they were mere worldly chatter, vying for superiority in contradiction."**

**"Indeed, I dare not. Hearing the words of the Heavenly Master, I am both awed and overjoyed. I shall strive with all my might, hoping to align with the heart-mind of the spirits and deities, to resolve the world’s sorrows, to pacify the emperor, and to allow the myriad things to each find their proper place. This is my wish."**

**"Your wish cannot be for your own solitary good. Yet the reason I alone retain good intentions is that my learning stems from reflecting on goodness. Thus, while others age and perish, I alone endure. Though the descendants of my ancestors have all passed, I alone have not died. Truly, I have received a profound mandate, and I am ashamed before the August Heaven, unable to repay it. I constantly think to exhaust all my strength, yet I know not how to make recompense. Seeing Heaven and Earth out of harmony, wind and rain untimely, I know this is a grave illness for the world, and I ever pity it."**

**"Now, having heard the words of the divine person, I am greatly awakened. I shall strive to the death to offer myself to the enlightened Heaven, to resolve this grave illness, to pacify the principles of Earth, to firmly establish the emperor, and to allow the myriad things to each find their proper place. I hope thereby to repay and fulfill the profound merit of Heaven. Yet I know not whether I am capable. I humbly beg to ask further, for I am unworthy of the enlightened master."**

**"Excellent are your words! Hearing them, I too rejoice—what need is there to speak of Heaven? My texts [lacuna]—not one in ten thousand shall be lost."**

"Only strive diligently without slackening to govern it, and you may indeed restore the work of Heaven—doubt it no more. If even emperors and kings practice this, they shall swiftly gain its power, how much more so for you? Having heard your words again and again, I dare not hold back my utmost effort; though I am your elder, my resolve does not match yours. Now, together with you, I share this Heaven and Earth, and I wish to join you in pacifying them. I wished to say no more, but I fear I would incur grave fault before you and suffer heavy punishment from Heaven. Listen carefully once more, and I shall explain it to you again in full detail.

The true text is the very heart of Heaven and Earth, preserving the primal qi and its principles. In ancient times, sacred scriptures emerged in their time, examining the original correct characters. The Dao is transmitted through mutual dependence: subtle words elucidate it, all being essential to the primal qi. The second transmission yields esoteric phrases; the third forms chapters and verses; the fourth becomes ornate embellishment; the fifth diverges into disparate meanings, each asserting its own opposition; the sixth becomes deceptive rhetoric. Chapters and verses still retain some semblance of the original, but beyond this lies grave illness. This is what causes the Dao of Heaven to lose its way, emperors and kings to suffer long sorrow, and the profound principles to remain unattained—this is the very reason.

You, fortunate one, wish to repay Heaven’s grace and restore its great work. Heaven does not delight in people offering their wealth or rare counterfeit goods; it delights only in people jointly governing its texts without disorder. When I first saw you come to study, I thought you would ask but one or two things and depart—how could I have imagined you would seek to master the Dao of Heaven in its entirety? Though my words may not be perfect, the Dao of Heaven may yet be glimpsed.

If you delight in rectifying Heaven and Earth, take the subtle words and trace them back to verify their origin; when they align with the primal source, you shall grasp the mind of Heaven and may thereby pacify the world. Collate the texts of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, summoning them by category to assemble and follow one another. Let one person hold fast to the root, for each has its own fundamental matter. All texts and writings have their own lineages; let all people bring forth their talents, gather together to expound them, and the true essence of the original words shall naturally emerge. Collect and assemble the essential sayings to form their explication, calling it ‘chapters and verses,’ and you shall attain the true heart of the Dao.

This may be called resolving Heaven’s sorrow, removing the great illness, ending the suffering of Earth, allowing emperors and kings to wander in accord with Heaven’s mind, and enabling the myriad things to each find their proper place. In this, not one in ten thousand shall be lost."

"Seeing the profundity of your words, I know you are Heaven’s messenger; I dare not deceive you. To deceive you now would be to deceive Heaven itself. Should Heaven be displeased, it would instead diminish my years, bringing harm upon myself and shame before the August Sky, while offering no benefit to the myriad people. The fault would be grave indeed. You must strive to remember this: know only that I dare not hold back any effort."

"Indeed, indeed! Hearing your words, my heart trembles with awe. Since this is Heaven’s inquiry, I dare not delay or linger—only press on to its completion. I pray you, Master, forgive my shortcomings and instruct me on what is difficult or easy, that I may dare to ask in full."

"Now, with so many texts accumulated, I wish to know their truth or falsity—just as you asked before. Those that resonate in tenfold or hundredfold accord are true; all else is false. Those that govern and yield results are true; all else is false practice. To obtain such results, the people and ministers must all be good, loyal, and trustworthy.

Why say this? If a child is virtuous, parents remain at peace and find their proper place. If a wife is virtuous, her husband avoids transgression and gains her strength. If a minister is virtuous, the state enjoys enduring stability. When emperors, kings, people, and ministers are all virtuous, Heaven knows no disasters or omens—this is the principle. Do you understand? Or do you not?"

"Very well, I now wish to discuss a matter with you. If you were to select and extract from my texts, would you thoroughly comprehend and master them?"

"I am but a youth, still unenlightened—I have not grasped their meaning."

"Try to explain it, and I shall see whether you fully understand or not."

"As this humble student sees it, one should assemble and apply them in their entirety, with upper and lower mutually sustaining each other. By examining each matter, comparing a hundred to a thousand, a thousand to ten thousand, and cross-referencing them, one may deem them sufficient. Otherwise, I fear the ancient texts cannot be fully encompassed."

"Indeed, what you say is true. Have you not recorded in my texts before: 'From one compare to ten, from ten to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand, from a thousand to ten thousand, from ten thousand to a hundred million'—this is precisely the principle."

"Yes, yes. But whom should we appoint to carry out this comparison?"

"Let each act according to their station. Those who understand the roots of affairs rely on their foundations. Those skilled in knowledge and application shall gather to deliberate, circulating their discourse. From emperors and kings down to the common people, all shall abandon their old ways and unite in consensus. Those of lesser understanding shall first assemble among themselves, then submit to those of middling understanding; those of middling understanding shall assemble and submit to those of greater understanding; those of greater understanding shall assemble and submit to the emperor and kings. Then, all the worthy shall gather to harmonize their interpretations, refining and stabilizing them. This is how counsel reaches even the lowest ranks—no calculation is missed, no word is wasted, no text is discarded.

The lesser worthy shall collate and assemble the texts, then pass them to the middling worthy; the middling worthy shall collate and assemble them, then pass them to the greater worthy; the greater worthy shall collate and assemble them, then present them to the emperor and kings. Once the texts are □□ and their principles complete, free of error, truly aligned with Heaven’s will, and the divisions of yin and yang properly ordered, the emperor, kings, and all ministers shall together recognize their truth. Only then shall they be disseminated among the people, so that all under Heaven may recite and study the correct texts. Thus, Heaven’s qi shall be attained, Great Peace shall arrive, the qi of supreme harmony shall descend, songs of praise shall arise, all things shall abide in peace, the people shall have no complaints, false texts shall vanish of themselves, Heaven’s afflictions shall be cured, Earth’s maladies shall disappear, emperors and kings shall wander in leisure, yin and yang shall rejoice, perverse qi shall be concealed, bandits and thieves shall be eradicated, the Central Kingdom shall flourish, its glory shall rival the Three Sovereigns of old, the barbarians shall retreat, all things shall flourish, and all under Heaven shall be most fortunate, all proclaiming 'ten thousand years!'

Do not suppress my texts!"

"Yes, yes—I dare not conceal or obstruct them."

Having received the master’s instructions, you must sincerely return and report them, for to conceal them would risk incurring grave transgression and bringing matters to ruin.

"Excellent indeed are your words. Having aligned with Heaven’s will, your name shall be recorded as one who has repaid Heaven’s great merit."

"Yes, yes. I shall truly withdraw to a secluded place, ponder their profound meaning, and never slacken in diligence."

"Go now, and doubt no more."

*Collated and Annotated* Taiping Jing*, Scroll 52, Ding Section I*
*The Diagram of the Womb’s Yin-Yang Rules and the Rectification of Conduct to Dissolve Evil*

The divine being speaks, the perfected one internalizes: you have already understood. To diminish the self is to fulfill the intent. External principles rectify themselves; close your eyes and gaze inward, communing with the spirit. Utter no words, and you merge with the Dao. Yin and yang enfold one another, sealed by Heaven. The art of longevity may open your eyes—do not strain the bowels, but embrace harmony and magnanimity. Heaven and Earth receive harmony as the deaf and blind receive light.

To grasp its meaning, consider the child within the womb: after ten months without eating, the spirit communes. The natural Dao has no superior; without looking, qi dwells in the twelve chambers. Thus, to revert to infancy is to avoid misfortune; to grow old and return to youth is to commune with the Dao. For this reason, the twelvefold image is drawn: the upright attain goodness, while the unworthy meet misfortune alone.

The Dao of Heaven endures, never lost or destroyed. Its form is like the four seasons, cycling back to their origin, returning to the beginning in old age—hence, longevity. Ponder its meaning without deviation; accumulate virtue, practice the Dao, and cultivate yourself. Yet no effort surpasses the Dao’s return to its rightful recipient. If one is not the proper vessel, the Dao does not act in vain.

The Dao is like the wind, silently abiding beside you. Employ it, and it exists; neglect it, and it vanishes. The worthy have their domain, the unworthy their place. Life and death reside within the self, ever fixed in conduct. Heaven commits no error; humans bring ruin upon themselves. Reflect deeply on its meaning, and you shall act without recklessness.

Heaven grants longevity to those who guard the Dao and act with vigor; humans refuse to do so and thus perish. Heed my warnings well: when you transmit the Dao to its proper recipient, it flows with ease. In ancient times, sages and worthies transmitted the Dao, swearing blood oaths. The Dao of Heaven is weighty in accumulation, yet fools treat it lightly. The Dao is the teacher of all things: those who attain it gain clarity, while those who lose it fall into confusion.

Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they do not overlook even the slightest detail. The wise and knowing nurture themselves, conversing with the divine as equals—this is the essence of yin and yang, the pivot of Heaven and Earth. The sages of old deeply understood this and thus made it their standard, distinguishing the essentials of Heaven’s Dao. Internally, it governs the self; externally, it dissolves calamities. To fail in this is to share in the sorrows of Heaven and Earth.

**Distinguishing the Four Methods of Governance, Scroll 79**

The Perfected One, Pure and Reverent, bowed in trepidation: *"I now wish to ask something further, though it is no matter of the Dao. Having heard the enlightened master speak, there is nothing that remains unresolved—thus I dare, despite my shame, to press forward with a question that lingers in doubt: what is it?"*

*"Speak plainly, and I shall explain it to you."*

*"When the Son of Heaven employs great ministers, they ought all to be elders; the young are fundamentally unfit to govern the age."*

*"Why do you ask this? I observe the qi of Heaven—of late, it has repeatedly fallen into disharmony. The fault may lie with officials who fail in their duties, causing the seasonal qi to lose its balance. The lord of men lacks clarity, calamities arise in concert, and even Daoists are harmed. Now, the Three Luminaries of Heaven and Earth suffer affliction, their radiance obscured. Where can the Daoist flee to escape unscathed? Though I alone have long been favored by Heaven’s grace and endured, I dare not presume my own safety."*

*"From my earliest years, I have served masters and inquired of affairs, yet none could fully resolve my doubts. Now, undeterred by shame, I ask again of the Heavenly Master to clarify the essential meaning, lest I never come to understand it."*

*"Since the enlightened master has deigned to instruct, I, your disciple, can do no other than explain what you have not yet grasped."*

*"Excellent indeed are your words!"*

"Today, upon hearing your words, I know that the governance of Great Peace has arrived. Yet, I shall now explain it fully, and you shall record it in detail."

"Governance has four methods: the governance of Heaven, the governance of Earth, the governance of Man, and when the three qi reach their utmost, all things that walk and crawl are governed. I wish to hear their meaning."

"The governance of Heaven: when its ministers are aged, the lord treats them as fathers and teachers. Though the ministers’ positions are humble, why treat them as teachers and fathers? It is because their positions are lowly, but their virtue and power are esteemed. To treat them as teachers and fathers is to serve their virtue and power, to join with them in counsel and bring peace to the world.

The governance of Earth: the lord treats his ministers as friends, as if sharing the same aspirations and heart. Earth is yin and compliant, like mother and child in one rank, sharing the same embrace and sorrows. Though the ministers’ positions are humble, their virtue brings harmony, harmonizing the lord’s governance.

The governance of Man: the lord employs the young and small, like a father raising his child. The child is young and cannot yet devise strategies for the father, so this governance is slightly disordered.

When all things that walk and crawl are governed, the lord regards his ministers and subjects as dogs or grass and trees, no longer carefully selecting them for office. He appoints whoever fills the post, treating them as mere semblances of men without understanding. Why is this so? Such semblances only mimic human form, barely sufficient for the task, and do not consider the lord’s interests. Thus, they contend for advantage.

To emulate Heaven’s governance: all ministers under Heaven become the lord’s teachers and fathers. Thus, he treats them as fathers. People love their children—what danger could there be? If teachers and fathers can resolve the eight directions’ calamities for their children, how could there be failure?

To emulate Earth’s governance: all ministers under Heaven become the lord’s friends. With shared aspirations and counsel, they share sorrows and seek to secure their positions. Earth is compliant and follows above, fully aligning with Heaven’s will, all attaining Heaven’s favor—how could there be instability?

To emulate Man’s governance: it attains the qi of central harmony. Harmony is difficult to discern, advancing or retreating unpredictably, like a young child who cannot yet plan for his father, deceiving him. Young ministers cannot deeply plan for their lord, so they deceive him. The young have been nourished by the sun and moon for few days, their learning is shallow, and they inspire no awe—thus, they deceive. Hence, this governance is slightly disordered.

To emulate the governance of all things that walk and crawl: such creatures lack propriety and righteousness, and all things possess little wisdom and no virtue. Their nature knows no hierarchy, seeking only victory—thus, they bring chaos and ruin.

Heaven’s governance is benevolent, cherishing life and avoiding harm. Earth’s governance is compliant and good, causing minor harm. Man’s governance is mutually beneficial and desirous, frequently injuring one another, deceiving and neglecting. The governance of all things that walk and crawl ultimately achieves nothing, regardless of scale, seeking only victory.

Observing these modes of governance suffices to know whether the qi of Heaven, above and below, has reached its utmost without losing order. Those who desire the first joy should emulate Heaven; those who desire the second, Earth; the third, Man; the fourth, all things.

Emulating Heaven, one alone attains long life, gaining Heaven’s favor. Emulating Earth, one’s life is slightly shortened, gaining Earth’s intent. Emulating Man, one’s life is further reduced. Emulating all things, one dies without fixed time or number.

Emulating Heaven, the three Dao align with the scriptures. Heaven has three patterns: the luminous are the Three Luminaries—sun, moon, and constellations. The sun examines yang, the moon examines yin, and the stars examine the center. Thus, the three Dao must circulate writings, striving for wisdom. When writings arrive for the departed, they bear only the master’s name—do not ask who delivered them.

Emulating Earth, two Dao circulate writings. Emulating Man, one Dao circulates writings, barely lingering. Emulating all things, words are merely uttered, with no writings at all.

Is this now Heaven’s decree, or do men act of their own accord? Is it the course of time? Nevertheless, when an emperor’s governance approaches Great Peace, he aligns with Heaven’s likes and dislikes, emulating Heaven’s governance. For moderate peace, he emulates Earth’s governance. For minor disorder, he follows Man’s governance. For great chaos and disorder, he follows the governance of all things that walk and crawl. Why is this so?

Now, how shall we remedy this? When Heaven wills a rise, auspicious omens and prophetic writings emerge, bestowed to awaken him and grant him the mandate. When decline is willed, Heaven conceals its writings, and he is made disinclined to seek them.

Are worthy ministers merely those who are aged? No. The aged are those venerable in years and rich in virtue, emulating Heaven by steadfastly upholding the Dao without losing the slightest measure—thus, they secure their emperor. The aged who possess no wisdom are unfit for office.

How, then, does one treat them as teachers and fathers? As friends? As children? And how does one treat all things?"

To treat them as fathers is to take instruction from them as a son does from a stern father, or as a disciple receives teaching from an enlightened master. One must grasp the profound strategies and secret words of sacred texts from their heart, thereby pacifying the realm, repaying the ancestors, and offering sacrifices to the ancestral temples. Through such virtue, one repays Heaven’s great merit, thus winning the hearts of all under Heaven. Yin and yang harmonize, and disasters cease.

To treat them as friends is to join in loyalty and trust, pooling strategies to weigh good and evil, difficulty and ease.

To treat them as children: if a father conceals something, he does not dare inform his son; if a son hides a fault, he does not dare tell his parents. Both deceive one another, using this as a pretext.

As for all things—when great chaos abounds without number—creatures in spring and summer vie for life, while in autumn and winter they vie for death, no longer granting one another even a moment’s respite.

Chun prostrated himself again: “The questions I have asked are many, my transgressions grave and weighty. This is most improper; I have truly overstepped before my teacher. Moreover, I dare not conceal this text. Yet if I see it and do not act upon it, I fear I will offend August Heaven. Where, then, should I place this book?”

“Since you have asked, you must exert yourself to practice it. When you encounter one who can comprehend it, entrust it to him, that he may deliver it to a virtuous ruler. If the emperor and kings model themselves upon it and take it as their governance, they will surely become as divine. But if one receives it and fails to ponder and apply it deeply, Heaven will no longer hold you accountable.”

“Indeed, I dare not oppose my teacher’s words.”

“Yet my words must not be greatly opposed either. This is Heaven and Earth’s desire for peace, and thus the supreme Dao emerges, prompting you to journey far and inquire of this method. Heaven has sent me to speak, to transmit these words to you—I do not speak idly. If Heaven did not wish it spoken, and I recklessly revealed Heaven’s essential Dao, I would be held to account. But since you have received my words and will deliver them, there is no harm and no doubt.

I tell you in utmost sincerity: Heaven will bestow even greater favor upon the emperor and kings—thus I admonish you. Heaven’s movements have their appointed times for fortune and misfortune. Those who obtain and practice this will meet with unquestionable good fortune.”

“May I humbly ask: who is the person that will carry this out—what is their name?”

“Now, Heaven bestows upon all things without partiality. The one who asks and is first to practice it—that is the person. The great Dao is of utmost weight; it cannot be entrusted to private hands. Those who practice it will prosper; those who do not will falter.”

“May I further ask: what does Heaven and Earth observe? At this moment, would you speak a single word?”

“Truly, there is something to observe—this is not empty speech. Heaven rejoices in peace and stability, free from illness; it delights in supreme harmony. Thus, it causes the people to remain tranquil, without evil clamor or strife. Each dwelling in their proper place, free from sickness and filled with joy—then Heaven speaks and does not utter falsehood.

But if now yin and yang clash in opposition, disorderly and entangled, harming one another; if the myriad things cannot abide in their places; if the sun and moon lack good brightness and the constellations move in chaos—then Heaven is afflicted with illness, distressed and unresolved. It does not transmit its words, and the malady persists. Thus, in times of disorder, discourse arises—minor disorder calls for minor discourse; great disorder, great discourse.

Therefore, from ancient times to the present, divine perfected sages serve as Heaven’s envoys, receiving Heaven’s intent and acting as Heaven and Earth’s interlocutors. Since Heaven and Earth established their work, this has been the constant principle. Thus, the sacred texts of the sages, past and present, speak for Heaven, articulating Heaven’s affairs.

What do these words and discourses address? They attend to what is afflicted and suffering. Where texts are deficient, the Dao’s substance is applied; where substance is not understood, the Dao’s texts are used. Where wickedness and evil are afflicted, the Dao rectifies and purifies, awakening them.

Now, Heaven and Earth are most revered and divine, their divinity luminous, their position supreme. Why do they not eliminate illness themselves, instead transmitting words to humans? Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Though the parents may be good, if their children act perversely, dwelling at the center and presiding over their wickedness, governing above and below in rebellion and chaos—though the parents are good, the household becomes evil.

It is like a son who rebels against his father, a minister who rebels against his lord, a disciple who rebels against his teacher, a wife who rebels against her husband. In such cases, mutual harm and great disorder arise, and no goodness is to be seen. Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things fundamentally govern one affair together. When good prevails, all rejoice; when misfortune strikes, all suffer—thus they share the same sorrow. If they did not govern together, they would not willingly take turns bearing one another’s sorrows.

Therefore, when Heaven and Earth desire goodness and peace, they must send divine perfected sages to transmit their words, reveal their sacred texts, and communicate with one another—just as when an emperor or king seeks joy in goodness, there are good teachings. This is what is meant here.

If you wish to joyfully know Heaven’s intent, to repay Heaven’s merit, and to rescue from calamitous qi, this book of mine is the way. Receive it, ponder it well, and Heaven’s intent will be known to you.”

“Indeed, I dare not be negligent. I humbly beg my teacher to admonish me once or twice more.”

“Now, good and evil each pertain to the self. The good benefit themselves; the evil harm their own bodies. Since you possess such a flourishing good intent, grieving over Heaven and Earth’s illness and the ruler’s unease, your merit is already immense. But consider this carefully: your practice of goodness is peerless—do not cease or be discouraged. Let your thoughts dwell on goodness and follow the constant Way thus.”

“Indeed, I dare not be remiss, dare not be remiss.”

“My questions have accumulated in great number, and hearing the Celestial Master’s words brings boundless joy. Yet my inquiries know no end—may I humbly beg one or two more admonitions?”

“Proceed with balance.”

“Now, I wish to grasp the intent of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the people, the crawling creatures, and all things under the sun, so that they may perpetually delight in goodness without cease. Let them wander each day without office or duty, their bodies each rectified, no longer turning to grieve or reproach one another. Might I hear how this may be achieved?”

“Your words now are most excellent and singular—what questions you ask, what peerless goodness! Yet if you inquire thus, you must still align with affairs, each attaining their heart’s desire. Follow their capacities and limits, never forcing what they cannot do. Thus, each attains what they wish. When each attains their wish, none will grieve or suffer. Each will fulfill their heart’s intent—this may be called wandering without office or duty.

**〈Rise〉**
Between Heaven and Earth, it is ever the way to assign tasks beyond one’s ability, to compel what one cannot achieve, and to make difficult what one cannot do. When one sees another’s inability to act or speak, instead of pitying and teaching them, one turns to reproach, causing grievances to knot and anger to breed litigation. The people grow sorrowful, distressed, and impoverished. Then they lift their faces and cry to August Heaven: *Truly, this is injustice! Truly, this is injustice!* Their qi stirs the six directions. Thus, calamities and omens arise in profusion, accumulating in myriad forms, impossible to swiftly dispel. The harm is grave—this is the loss of the world’s heart and intent. In the end, no success is achieved, and anomalies never cease. How then may the qi of Great Peace arise? Thus, Great Peace cannot be attained—this is precisely the fault.

**〈End〉**
Though one may call it ‘constant balance,’ how can internal disorder be cleansed and governance achieved?”

“You now ask this—do you wish to know it deeply and truly? The nature of Heaven and Earth is such:

**〈Rise〉**
All things have their own proper place. One must employ their strengths and what they can do, never forcing what they cannot. Though all things receive the qi of yin and yang, it is like fish that cannot live without water, nor swim upon high mountains. Yet when water is present, regardless of depth or shallowness, they may swim freely. Great trees cannot grow without soil, nor thrive in the midst of rivers and seas. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity, when assigning tasks, took from the five soils what was fitting. Only then did things flourish and prosper, each in its excellence. The state grew wealthy, the ancestral temples offered rich flavors, and the world knew peace, free from suffering. Malign qi ceased, no longer causing harm.

If one does not divine and observe the land before planting, the myriad things cannot fulfill their natural lifespan. All will harbor unresolved grievances, perishing prematurely. This alone moves August Heaven. When nothing can be reaped, the state falls into extreme poverty. Food lacks rich flavor, the ancestral temples hunger and thirst, and the world is filled with sorrow. The people turn to mutual harm, ruler and minister deceive one another, inner and outer realms speak in discord. This is where fault first arises.

If even the myriad things cannot attain their proper place, how much more so for humans? The world cannot be governed rightly—this is the very reason. This is the root of great harm, the path to peril and ruin. **〈End〉** Can one not be cautious? Can one not deeply ponder this in heart and mind?

Thus, the great sages and worthies of antiquity, when appointing others, first tested their strengths and weaknesses before assigning office. They then entrusted them accordingly. If one erred, they reproached them, questioning their strengths but never their shortcomings. This does not offend Heaven. Instead, it fosters the refinement of their learning. Thus, they won the hearts of the world.

Later generations, neglecting affairs, failed to deeply ponder the words of the ancient sages. They appointed those unfit for office, reproached what they could not achieve, and questioned what they could not perceive. The blind cannot see the sun; the mute cannot speak. Yet they hastened to seize upon their faults, deeming them grave transgressions, and punished them. They did not seek mutual benefit and aid but instead schemed to manipulate above and below, harming one another in turn. This is the great ruin of the world.

The lords of Great Peace in antiquity possessed no extraordinary or divine Way. They simply employed each according to their heart’s capacity. Thus, they attained the qi of Great Peace and left no grievances among the people.

When calamity and chaos are about to arise, it is always because one appoints those unfit for their abilities, assigns tasks beyond their office, and heavily reproaches them. Though punishment may bring death, it cannot rectify their duties. Disasters and omens arise in succession, impossible to suppress. Thus, chaos and ruin follow. Good and ill fortune, peace and peril—all arise from this.

Therefore, when the ancients selected officials for the emperor, they first examined and tested their abilities. Did they align with the auspicious responses of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang? Those who did not align were deemed false in conduct. How did they align? The great attained great responses; the small, small responses. Wind and rain came in their proper seasons; the myriad things flourished; the hundred clans spoke no complaints; birds and beasts, crawling creatures, all rested in tranquility. These were the signs.

Thus, those who govern and wish to pacify the state must carefully consider their appointments. Heaven gives birth to the myriad things, each with its own talents and proper place. It is like the dragon ascending to the heavens and the fish swimming in the abyss—this is what is meant.

Since the establishment of Heaven and Earth, governance has taken myriad forms. As the times change, so too do Heaven’s transformations. The essential task is to accord with Heaven and Earth, attaining their intent and fulfilling their desires.”

The heavens inscribe their patterns through the Three Luminaries, marking each rise and decline, with the wind serving as the ruler of men. The earth inscribes its veins through mountains and rivers, furrows and paths—mountains exhale qi, waters course through channels, their waxing and waning, shifting and collapsing, merging and parting, all governed by the winds of change as ministers to the sovereign. Humankind transmits meaning through speech and language, through written records and evolving texts. The myriad things speak of their flourishing and decay, allowing people to perceive and understand them.

Humankind stands at the center of yin and yang, as the teacher and elder of all things, capable of the most abundant creations. Embodied like spirits yet possessing form, advancing and retreating in transformation, they must carefully record these changes and anomalies to report them to their lord. Thus, if one word remains uncommunicated, grievances become knotted; if two words remain uncommunicated, blockages arise; if three words remain uncommunicated, separation follows; if four words remain uncommunicated, harmony fails to respond in due season, and the birth of things becomes irregular; if five words remain uncommunicated, the circulation of qi leads to conflict; if six words remain uncommunicated, the six directions breed malice; if seven words remain uncommunicated, ruin ensues; if eight words remain uncommunicated, governance becomes fragmented among contending factions; if nine words remain uncommunicated, mutual harm arises; if ten words remain uncommunicated, mutual upheaval follows. Therefore, one must strive to ensure the free flow of words.

In ancient times, there were no written records—how then was communication achieved? Writing arose precisely for this purpose, though it later ceased. How often have Heaven and Earth arisen, how often have they ceased? It is only that later generations have not witnessed it. In the middle antiquity of the Three Sovereigns, words were established without writing. In later antiquity, the qi of Heaven and Earth rose and fell in cycles, yet even the divine and transcendent could not fathom their origins. Having endured many vicissitudes, they understood the principles of division and order, and though writing must have existed internally, later generations have not seen it. To claim it never existed—why then does writing appear at some times and vanish at others?

As Heaven’s qi declines, people grow foolish, weak, and short-lived, unable to inscribe and record. Thus, writing was commanded to be created, allowing transmission across time and knowledge of ancient affairs. Without writing, disputes could not be settled, each party insisting on their own rightness. Therefore, writing was devised for the sake of the ignorant, as Heaven issued its covenantal texts.

---

The disciple said, “I have heard the master’s words and now understand. I wish to know how to ensure the free flow of qi in the present age.”

The master replied, “Simply let the Three Ways circulate the writings of the eight directions, and the words of the people, officials, and commoners—do not arbitrarily obstruct them. Urgent matters should be resolved in their time; non-urgent matters should follow the rhythms of Heaven and Earth, the myriad things. Wait until the seventh month, when things reach their end, then review them in the eighth month, rearrange them in the ninth, and by the tenth month, those who have not returned should be noted. After three years, those who submit writings of utmost sincerity should be sought out and appointed. Such individuals are the state’s finest ministers, keen of hearing and sharp of sight, able to observe and listen without missing the signs of the four directions. When the emperor or king obtains such a one, governance becomes secure and enlightened—such a person must be entrusted.

---

The disciple asked, “How should one entrust them?”

The master replied, “Each must be questioned on the extent of their abilities, allowing them to record what they can do, what they can analyze, and what they excel in. Appoint them according to their innate nature, and their governance will be without error. Thus, they will win the hearts of all under Heaven, and their rule will daily advance toward Great Peace—without punishments, without exhausted resources, without grievances among the people. Heaven and Earth will achieve perfect harmony, and all things will flow unimpeded. This is how one attains the longevity of the Supreme Sovereigns. Those who live long do so because they avoid punishments and harm; those who inflict much harm will in turn harm themselves.

Thus, the sages of high antiquity refused to favor punishments. In middle antiquity, punishments were used sparingly, and lifespans were halved. In later antiquity, punishments were used extensively, and lifespans became short indeed. Punishments are evil—they offend Heaven, disrupt yin and yang, and accumulate as malevolent qi, which returns to harm people. The sages of high antiquity avoided their heavy use out of care for their own lives. The people of middle antiquity were half-foolish, using punishments lightly and thus harming half of themselves. The people of later antiquity were greatly foolish, treating punishments as routine, and thus most did not attain long life—the fault lies here.

Those who read this text should ponder it repeatedly, value it, and handle it with care. Life and death are weighty matters; they must not be treated lightly. A worthy and enlightened father plans deeply for his son; a worthy and enlightened minister plans deeply for his lord. An unworthy son does not plan deeply for his father; an unworthy minister does not plan for his lord. The young are like their own selves—whether they encounter fortune or misfortune will influence later generations. This is the established pattern.

Therefore, when the sage emperors and kings of high antiquity were to appoint ministers, they carefully selected those of the Dao and virtue who did not delight in killing or harming—not merely for the sake of the people, but for the sake of their own lives. Thus, they aligned with the will of Heaven and Earth, their actions moving as if in concert with the spirits. This is what is meant by ‘careful selection yielding the right person’—a ruler who gains the strength of others.

Such rulers move the gods and spirits, and the true spirits of Heaven above come to love them, granting them long life. Those who favor punishments align with yin qi, and yin is associated with killing—thus they do not attain great longevity. The Mandate of Heaven can be glimpsed and known; the aversions of Heaven, Earth, and humankind are the same.”

Right—when a state gains the favor of Heaven and Earth, the people, and the myriad things, the nation prospers, families are secure, and the world knows no disputes or litigation. *Tai Ping Jing* Combined Collated Edition, Scroll 55, Ding Section IV. *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 55: "The Decisive Method of Diligent Practice and Broad Learning," Chapter Eighty-Two.

“Now, can the Great Mandate be known or not?”
“Though it may be known, having met a luminous teacher and heard his words, my great confusion has dissolved—yet I cannot help but ask once more for your earnest instruction.”
“Very well. The intent of my Dao may now be glimpsed. Rise and take up this text to read it. I have long lamented that it is not mastered; only when mastered can its full meaning be grasped. If one does not deeply ponder its profound intent or study it with precision, even obtaining this text will be of no benefit. To possess it yet fail to practice it diligently—how is this different from never having obtained it? To see food yet not eat—how is this different from having no grain? To see water yet not drink—thirst cannot be quenched. This does not harm others but only oneself. Can one not reflect carefully upon this?

Thus, the sage exerts effort in contemplation, the noble person in study, ceaselessly day and night, ever delighting in emulating Heaven, which turns and moves without cease. The hundred rivers flow and gather to form the great seas. Take heed of my words and remember them well. I have admonished you repeatedly; your earnestness is plain to see.

When doing good, share it with the multitude of worthies. Take care not to monopolize the marketplace, for a marketplace with few people yields nothing sought. Thus, if one does not study broadly, what one perceives remains unclear. This is why, though one may glimpse the true Dao, its essential meaning is not grasped. Without faith in the Dao, doubt cannot be dispelled—each person’s self-imposed limitation lies here. Therefore, one must deeply ponder its intent to enable self-rescue and mutual aid.”

Here the *Indications of Lifespan*: Knowing the Method of Prosperity, Decline, and the Return of Years—Chapter Eighty-Three

Heaven’s bestowal of affairs follows its own laws. Destiny may be entrusted, and the Dao may be practiced. Though emergence comes sooner or later, its gradual signs are foreseen. For instance, the myriad things sprout in *zi*, grow in *mao*, branch in *wu*, mature in *you*, and conclude in *hai*. Though affairs are foreseen in advance, they cannot be assured.

Each matter has its practicable aspect. When the radiant sign appears first, the affair has not yet manifested—one must prepare its path in advance. Heaven’s hanging of images always precedes, never following behind. When the right person is found and the way is opened, those who receive aid and assistance are revealed. If the way is not opened nor made passable, action yields no success—such is not the right person.

This serves as clear proof. The Dao, when examined and spoken of, never errs by even one in ten thousand. For such a person, the way is opened with clarity; for one who is not, it remains closed. When the right person is truly found, illnesses may be dispelled, calamities and anomalies dissolve of themselves, and barbarians submit without need of arms—they all vanish naturally.

The arising of the myriad things each has its proper arrangement. With the right person, it unfolds of itself; without, it conceals itself. In all affairs, if the right person is not found, one must not force action. What is not one’s own must not be forcibly taken. What is not suited to the land must not be forcibly planted—if planted, it will not grow. To speak of poor seed: if it does not find its proper place within, how can it endure long? The six poles and eight directions each have their suitable things, all manifest yet differing in every affair.

Thus, metal resides in the west, wood in the east. Each in its proper place flourishes; out of place, it perishes. Therefore, the myriad things take root in the earth to live—they cannot cling to heaven. The sun, moon, stars, and celestial markers, by contrast, cling to heaven to generate light and brightness. Such is the Dao. Thus, when the right person’s star is in the sky, the time is bright; if it falls to earth, it loses its light—this is not its proper place. It disrupts the constant Dao.

There are practicable aspects that do not act recklessly. For the right person, it is clear; for one who is not, it cannot be enacted. The Dao is profound and distant, beyond measure. Those who lose it fail; those who attain it flourish.

To know one’s own prosperity and decline, observe where the Dao takes root—spiritual numen may then arise. Within, there are signs of longevity to verify it, and by this, not one in ten thousand is mistaken. This is a divine scripture, a method for returning years. Its Dao is most weighty—how can one not reflect upon it? Therefore, transmit it to the benevolent and wise, testing them to see if they may practice it and preserve their lives.

When the right person appears, worthies and sages emerge together, divine scriptures and wondrous methods arise of themselves, all bringing joy—such is the person. This is the proof. If it does not accord with these words, or if only premonitions appear without practicable results, it must be left to later generations. The Dao does not emerge recklessly.

There are indeed those for whom it is fitting. One need only question the person and let them reflect for themselves. The Dao’s return cannot be forbidden, nor can it be compelled. One must allow what is fitting, observe its success—the Dao cannot be empty.

Yet talent is not as good as effort, and effort is not as good as unceasing action. All affairs under heaven are tested through trial and failure. Heaven and earth’s spirits test people, so people also emulate the heavenly Dao in testing one another. Those who encounter goodness have good destinies; those who encounter evil have doubtful fates.

From ancient times to the present, nothing moves heaven without utmost sincerity. To demand it forcefully is called coercion—sometimes it may still be obtained. If coercion fails, it truly is not one’s own. How can one forcibly take what is not? Such affairs are inharmonious, perverse, and disordered.

Human destiny has three grades: the Dao is entrusted to the wilds, given to those who can employ it. Those who cannot employ it are entrusted to the capital, cast into the marketplace—take care not to cut it off. If later generations have no heir, transmit the scripture to sages, worthies, and Daoist masters. Without an owner or name, entrust it to those who can employ it. The Dao has its own fitting recipients—it cannot be attached to just anyone’s words.

It is like great trees returning to the mountains, water flowing to the sea—it cannot be stopped, for it is the nature of heaven. Those who follow it flourish; those who oppose it perish. When a divine scripture wishes to emerge, it cannot be concealed. With the right person, it will surely spread; without, it remains dark, deaf, and blind, the body displeased, the eyes without light.

To study this strategy with joy—within it lies the key to extending life’s span. All the signs of Great Peace are already manifest: the people’s kindness, love, caution, and goodness all arise from it. The wise and sagely are pleased; wondrous texts from distant lands are all entrusted here. With unrelenting practice, one aids oneself. Enlightened kings and sagely rulers flourish; barbarians retreat and depart. The myriad people are most fortunate, all without complaint. Heavenly longevity is enacted—no more self-resentment. The old depart by fate, the young are preserved whole.

The scripture is transmitted through ten thousand generations without end, passed down among descendants. Daily, they teach one another—this is the true text, unchanging through the ages, bringing good fortune to people. When the Dao is fully accomplished, it becomes natural. Blessings arrive of themselves, and none dare refuse.

The great person who obtains it governs the state in peace; the middling person becomes a worthy minister; the small person uses it to escape peril.

Here ends the *Strategy for Discerning the Dao’s Right and Wrong*

[Preserved] In *Ding* Section Four: To know the great efficacy of my Dao, entrust it to a wise and virtuous ruler, who will apply it. Immediately, it will resonate with heaven and earth—this is its great and luminous proof.

**Untitled Text: Responding to Heaven’s Principle, Harmonizing Above and Below, Eliminating Heavenly Disasters, and Severing the Roots of False Prognostication**

In high antiquity, people’s hearts were open, their eyes bright, and their ears penetrating. They foresaw events before they occurred, pondered deeply on what had not yet come to pass, and moved even the insentient. Standing apart from the common, none of their undertakings failed. Whatever they spoke or expounded was sincere and thorough, never straying from the imperial void of the heart. They yearned for boundless wisdom and boundless words. They knew the ebb and flow of human lifespans, each with its allotted portion, and constantly aligned with yin and yang to discern their waxing and waning. They grasped the essentials of above, below, and center, and made covenants with the myriad spirits. Yet none dared transgress the great taboos of heaven and earth. What they revered and received had to accord with Heaven’s will. Documents were exchanged, ascending to the Heavenly Lord. Upon receiving them, the Heavenly Lord saw their clear self-discipline and issued decrees to prevent self-reproach. Uprightness advanced of itself, and without report, their voices resonated clearly. The laws and norms of above and below never missed their appointed times. Fearful of falling short, they never failed to reproach themselves, ever anxious that errors might be recorded and scrutinized. Spirits reported to one another without negligence, and those found at fault were demoted or dismissed.

Thus, commands were reiterated, and documents repeated, lest their words be disobeyed. This was what Heaven rightfully upheld, what the gods and spirits looked up to—all in accordance with the law, never daring to rest. Fearful of miscommunication, they received multiple instructions, all of which they took to heart, lest they miss their appointed times. Spirits had their ranks, serving above and below. If they failed to act as decreed, they were immediately recorded as estranged. Their hearts were heavy with sorrow, ever as if starving or parched.

When the Heavenly Lord spoke, his teachings were issued, appointing overseers. Documents were numerous, but once their intent was grasped, each bore its own trust. The people of high antiquity, in matters of gain and loss, observed the inner and outer, above and below, and surveyed the four directions and beyond. They discerned the guiding principles, as months and years advanced, and spirits communicated anew—when would this ever end? The degrees of celestial bodies each had their reason, never shifting. Affairs unfolded in succession, leaving no room for doubt. They knew the origins of fortune and misfortune, and thus established calendars and records.

Three hundred and sixty days were calculated in great and small cycles, held without the slightest discrepancy—such was the short month. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each had their allotted principles. The clepsydra’s rise and fall, the water’s swiftness or slowness, the division of old and new—all were made clear, never missing even a fraction. Each month was set, with thirty-four solar terms, and the markers for seven or eight terms before and after. There were also seven or eight long days, used for entering and exiting, sacrificing to the heavenly spirits and earthly deities, and ensuring that officials adhered to the clepsydra’s schedule. To err was to fail in duty, and the offenses were many.

Thus, day and night were divided, following the lengthening and shortening of days. A hundred *ke* marked the period, with no room for error. In a virtuous state, the days were long, the water slow. One *cun* equaled ten *fen*, conforming to the numerical pattern. Today, most states disregard this: days and months are slightly shorter, with one *ke* reduced to eight or nine *fen*. Thus, the elderly, who should weaken with age, instead grow robust, while their years diminish. How could they endure for long? If a state has many ministers, its pivotal mechanisms move sluggishly. Later generations receive blessings, barely sustaining life. Not only do they incur misfortune, but they also invite attack.

The brilliance of heaven and earth resides in the south. *Si* and *Wu* share the same domain, with *Li* as the true eye. In the affairs of the Hall of Light, the sun shines from the south toward the north. The advance and retreat of yang *qi* never stray from the norm. Yin and yang press against one another, reaching toward the *Zi* direction. Cold and warmth align, their illumination penetrating naturally—how delightful! The Way of nurturing life: lesser yang and greater yang, wood and fire flourishing together, each attaining its desire—what conflict could there be? Inner and outer support one another, never losing their names. Above, it reaches the imperial radiance; below, it extends to the soundless. In stillness and spontaneity, the myriad things bloom in splendor, all clearly discernible. Without effort, they achieve completion—this is what Heaven reveres. They receive their names, and the pivotal mechanisms point the way. Life and death have their appointed times. The Controller of Destinies holds the registers, and the records of accounts are communicated in writing, never failing to respond to summons. When seeking verification from the spirit registers, the matter ascends to the Heavenly Lord, who has overseers. The reporting spirits never leave his side, and both within and without, they are revered. They dare not act on private authority. What ascends and descends never misses its time. The officials of greater yin never dare to slacken.

The gates and chambers of the central encampment fear self-promotion. Instead, they support one another in goodness and essential ways. Their names are recorded on documents, and upon receiving instructions, they act without missing even a fraction. In high antiquity, those of wisdom and foresight saw all without obstruction, receiving the Way of the divine luminaries. Their clarity was manifest, and they had their own laws and norms, never straying from the constant. From the Great Beginning onward, calendars had their lengths and brevity, profound and essential subtleties. From ancient times to the present, the essentials of calendrical systems lie in their establishment and completion. With focused thought and calculation, all that was accomplished below was achieved, and the numbers aligned with the plumb line. Years, months, and days were tallied, with major divisions accounted for.

**Untitled**

Now, heaven and earth are in great joy, and the seasons are abundant. The emperor should sit in peace, free from worry. The people need only wander without toil or minor duties. The five grains will no longer be as before, and their value will vanish.

**[Beginning]** The world will brew fine wine to drink together, and markets will reach extremes—this is called the "Water Mandate and Fire Phase," harming the transformations of yang. When a person drinks wine to intoxication, their pulse becomes erratic. They neglect their trades, fight to the death, or injure others. Some arrive at the market early, only to return empty-handed. Some fall prey to villains, or tumble from heights, or are harmed by carts and horses. The harms of wine are myriad, beyond counting. Consider the markets within the four seas—how many are there? In a single month, they consume tens of millions of *dou* and *hu* of the five grains. People are killed or injured daily without cause. Some are left orphaned, their descendants cut off. Some incur their parents’ enmity, bringing harm upon them. Some pass calamities to their descendants.

Local officials and magistrates, unable to redress these wrongs, beat their breasts and cry to Heaven, moving the august spirits to disrupt the qi of yin-yang, the four seasons, and the five phases. This obstructs the governance of the August Sovereign of Great Peace, causing the qi of Grand Harmony to flow in reverse. All because, without cause, they mobilize the people to brew wine, wasting the five grains and bringing about such calamities.

If only a virtuous ruler were to issue clear edicts and commands, declaring to officials and commoners: "From this day forward, should any dare to purchase and drink a single *dou* of wine without cause, they shall receive thirty lashes and three days of penal labor. For two *dou*, sixty lashes and six days of penal labor. For three *dou*, ninety lashes and nine days of penal labor." The duration of penal labor shall correspond to the measure of wine consumed. Wine-sellers shall be subject to the same penalties.

All shall be made to repair city walls, roads, and government buildings—this penal labor being a great earthen work. Earth overcomes water, thereby suppressing and extinguishing its excess, preventing water from harming yang beyond measure. Water is the Greater Yin, the people; to allow it to rise and dominate is to injure the essence of yang—a grievous harm indeed.

Repairing roads fosters the flourishing of the Great Way. By correspondence in kind, this gradually establishes Great Peace.

[Appendix] *Essentials of Rituals, Precepts, and Vinaya Excerpts*, Scroll Fourteen: On the Origins of Wine-Drinking

From the *Scripture of Great Peace*, the Perfected One asked: "Throughout the world, wine is brewed for drinking, and the marketways are overrun with it. When common folk drink to intoxication, they grow wild and reckless—some brawl to the death, others maim or murder, or commit adultery under its influence, or fall from heights in their drunkenness. The harms of wine are beyond counting. Consider how many markets exist within the Four Seas: in a single day, they consume hundreds of millions of *dou* of the five grains. This not only brings ruin in its wake but also implicates the magistrates, leaving descendants to lament, disturbing the August Heaven above, and throwing the yin-yang and the qi of the four seasons and five phases into chaos. Why then craft this madness-inducing draught for people to consume? Should it not be prohibited?"

The Divine One replied: "Excellent question! Food and drink sustain human life. My words may be heeded or disregarded, but let a virtuous ruler issue this decree: from this day forward, anyone who drinks one *dou* of wine without cause shall receive twenty lashes; two *dou*, sixty strokes of the rod; three *dou*, ninety strokes; and one *hu*, three hundred strokes. Let this scale be promulgated throughout the realm, so that the wise and noble, knowing the law and fearing disgrace, will never dare transgress. The foolish who violate it shall be punished, and wine-sellers shall share the same penalties as drinkers."

The Perfected One asked: "What of travelers from a thousand *li* away, or households with the elderly and infirm, or those offering libations to the spirits?"

The Divine One replied: "If a gentleman from afar knows the kingdom’s prohibitions, he will not lightly offend, nor may he gather in groups. As for households with the elderly or sick, medicinal wine shall be permitted."

To examine the interplay of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the myriad things—where above and below love and govern one another—is to establish merit and renown, to unify the heart in ruling a household, and to ensure that people no longer harbor hatred or malice, ever delighting in harmony of mind and shared purpose. Thus, the qi of Great Harmony shall issue forth daily, and grand peace shall flourish. The Six Directions shall unite in heart, the Eight Quarters in counsel. Where governance aligns with human intent, none shall fail to respond with joy.

This originates from the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, uniting the positions of yin and yang. Wickedness and evil shall silently vanish; the rebellious shall all submit. The luminous and numinous Supreme Dao is cherished by gods and spirits.

I, therefore, above expound the Dao and virtue to August Heaven, below distinguish the measures for mountains and rivers, and in the midst establish laws and regulations for emperors and kings, that the worthy may cultivate good intentions. Thereby, the great grievances and resentments of Heaven and Earth shall be resolved, sparing emperors and kings from sorrow and suffering. The people shall love one another, the myriad things shall each attain their proper place, and the constant standards of Heaven’s law shall remain unhidden.

In ancient times, sagely emperors and enlightened kings revered great ministers, cherished recluses, and benefited the people without harm or injury. Ministers, in turn, were loyal and trustworthy, never deceiving their rulers, so that governance was as if divine. Thus, a wise father constantly sought to bring peace to his son, and the son constantly sought to bring joy to his father. When the two joined forces with a single heart, no household affair went unaccomplished. But if they failed to unite in heart and strength, the household’s way fell into disorder. Neglecting their duties, they became impoverished and destitute, leading to strife, division, and separation—turning to mutual harm and injury. Even parents and children, born of the same flesh and blood, bound as limbs of one body, may thus part. How much more so when gathering men of disparate surnames to serve as rulers, teachers, and fathers?

Thus, the sage, perceiving the subtle and knowing the manifest, takes heed and exercises caution. The teacher, yang in nature, loves his disciples and guides them in the good Dao, teaching them to revere Heaven and cherish Earth, honor superiors and benefit inferiors. The disciples, in turn, respect and serve their teacher with diligence, loyalty, and trustworthiness, never deceiving. When the two join forces with a single heart, they study the ancient laws and institutions, practice the words of the sages, and clarify the divisions and principles of Heaven and Earth, ensuring the myriad things each attain their proper place. Accumulating worthiness without cease, they become the emperor’s worthy aides, joining in counsel to govern and bring about Great Peace.

But if they fail to unite in heart and counsel, refusing to transmit the essential Dao, instead pursuing vain and superficial words, deceiving and endangering one another, defying Heaven’s divisions and disrupting the sages’ teachings, the Six Directions shall grow indistinct, and great calamity shall befall the realm. If the emperor and his teacher lose the principles of governance, they shall become the great enemies of Heaven and Earth, failing to align with the will of the divine spirits—a grievous harm to the world.

Human life is endowed with both yin and yang; movement and stillness, anger and joy all have their proper times. Before the union of male and female, yin and yang must take charge to effect the work of generation. The Dao of Heaven is completed through threefold union, and so a child walks at three years of age. Three times three makes nine, and therein the harmonious Dao reaches its culmination. Before the union of male and female, the timely impulse within cannot be expressed.

The number of Heaven is five, the number of Earth is five, and the number of humanity is five. Three fives make fifteen, and the internal qi stirs. Four fives make twenty, aligning with the qi of the four seasons and giving rise to the impulse to procreate. The four seasons govern generation, and thus the impulse to generate arises. Five fives make twenty-five, and the qi of the Five Phases is fulfilled, enabling procreation. Five sixes make thirty, and strength is attained. Thus, Heaven causes the constant impulse to procreate, to connect with the lineage of Heaven and Earth, to propagate kindred beings. After thirty years, one is exempted. In old age, one declines; the young must cease seclusion within the chamber. Among the crawling creatures of the world, humans alone mirror Heaven and Earth in their completeness; the rest cannot.

Thus, in a single day and night, Heaven and Earth together generate twelve thousand things. Night is deep, day is dry. Depth pertains to yin; dryness pertains to yang. Heaven and Earth daily nourish these twelve thousand things to fullness. By Heaven’s law, yang unites its essence to form a dual-yang effusion, which descends into the Earth to join with it, together generating the twelve thousand things. Of these, two thousand are auspicious and virtuous beings.

The twelve thousand things each possess their own spirit and have their own rulers. Only when they follow a single great Dao can they circulate freely. The Dao of Heaven moves above and below, all coming to pay homage to their ruler—just as people following a single great Dao come to pay homage to their king. The spirits of the twelve thousand things, born together with Heaven and Earth, emerge along a single great Dao, some great, some middling, some small.

What does this mean? It means that among the twelve thousand things, some are great and some are small, and their Dao likewise varies in scale. Each generates, contains, and moves in its own way. Thus, the supreme Dao spans ten thousand paces as its standard; the next spans a thousand paces; the next, a hundred paces; the next, ten paces; and the last, one pace. These five Dao correspond to the Five Directions. Together, they descend to generate upon the Earth, together they ascend to pay homage to Heaven, and together they proceed along a single Dao.

Therefore, the great Dao spans ten thousand paces, accommodating the middling Dao of a thousand paces, the lesser Dao of a hundred paces, the fine Dao of ten paces, and the minute Dao of one pace. Things vary in size, each containing its own coming and going. All receive Heaven’s effusion above and, in turn, generate and effuse below upon the Earth, then together ascend to pay homage to Heaven.

Thus, the great Dao may be extended but must not be arbitrarily constricted; constriction prevents mutual accommodation. Some may fail to be born, others may be injured or die, unable to emerge—causing people to be cut off without descendants. The injured harm others; the dead kill others. The sages of antiquity dared not abolish or sever the great Dao, for they clearly beheld Heaven’s prohibitions.

How could one injure Heaven’s Dao? The Dao is Heaven, yang, and governs generation. Virtue is Earth, yin, and governs nourishment. If the myriad things largely fail to be born, it is known that Heaven’s Dao is injured. Where some fail to be born, it is known that Heaven’s lineage has been severed. If one thing fails to be born, one lineage is severed; if many fail, many lineages are severed. The extent of severance follows the number of things, revealing the injury to Heaven’s lineage.

When the Dao flourishes, it governs generation, and the myriad things all come to life. When virtue flourishes, it governs nourishment, and the myriad things and people are all nurtured, free from grievances and entanglements.

**Untitled Passage (Beginning):**
Why in my writings do I have the black ink serve as the base and the vermilion characters inscribed upon it? My Dao is the truth of vermilion and black: black embodies life and benevolence, possessing a heart; red is the great yang, the true color of Heaven.

**Untitled Passage (End):**
My Dao is the Dao of the great yang, the Dao of benevolent governance, which does not wish to harm.

The Son of Heaven is the heart of Heaven; the Empress is the heart of Earth. The heart governs the upholding of rectitude. Heaven covers all without exception, generates all without distinction, whether great or small, all receive the mandate to be born—thus it is called Heaven. Heaven is the true essence of the supreme Dao, never deceiving others. All things should cherish and love it. In its intentions and mind, one ought to accumulate sincerity and trust, ever desiring to benefit and not harm, never failing any being—thus it is called Heaven. The emperor and king are the children of Heaven, the leaders of humanity; their conduct should emulate this. The son ought to inherit his father’s teachings, strictly adhering to and enacting them, so that his affairs align with his father’s will and intentions—thus he may become the head of a good family. If he does not inherit his father’s teachings, his household, great and small, will fall into disorder, becoming a poor family. Wealth scatters in all four directions, never gathering, affairs become chaotic, disasters and calamities arise in succession, and profound suffering ensues—all faults lie here. In ancient times, when emperors and kings were about to act, they first looked up to the heart of Heaven, received its teachings, and only then proceeded.

The conduct of the Empress should rightly accord with the Earth. Earth bears all without exception, great and small alike return to it, neither good nor evil, all are embraced and nourished. The Empress is the child of Earth, the heart of Earth. The heart concerns itself with all matters; the child should emulate the mother’s conduct as the mother does—thus becoming a filial child. The correspondence between Heaven and Earth and the Empress is like the echo to the sound: if the error is small, the consequence is small; if great, the consequence is great. Even a deviation as slight as a hair’s breadth, if the mother’s will and intentions are not met, will result. In ancient times, when the Empress was about to act, she first contemplated the Earth, which embraces and nourishes all without exception. Nothing is unbearable, all has constancy; thus she finds peace and aligns with the heart of Earth. If she errs, disasters and calamities arise in succession, punishments cannot be restrained, yin overwhelms yang, the myriad things do not flourish—all faults lie here.

When these two act with rectitude, the divine and true appear, the true Dao emerges, the worthy and enlightened all hold office, and good things gather in the state.

**Primordial qi** is yang and governs generation; spontaneity and transformation are yin and govern the nourishment of all things. Heaven, yang, governs generation; Earth, yin, governs nourishment. The sun and day are yang, governing generation; the moon, stars, and night are yin, governing nourishment. Spring and summer are yang, governing generation; autumn and winter are yin, governing nourishment. *Jia*, *bing*, *wu*, *geng*, and *ren* are yang, governing generation; *yi*, *ding*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are yin, governing nourishment. *Zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu* are yang, governing generation; *chou*, *mao*, *si*, *wei*, *you*, and *hai* are yin, governing nourishment. All nines are yang, governing generation; all sixes are yin, governing nourishment. Men are yang, governing generation; women are yin, governing the nourishment of the myriad things. The male is yang, governing generation; the female is yin, governing nourishment. The ruler is yang, governing generation; the minister is yin, governing nourishment. In all matters under Heaven, there is one yin and one yang; only then can they generate and nourish one another. If yang does not bestow generation, yin is left empty and void, with nothing to nourish. If yin does not receive transformation, yang has no lineage of generation to bestow. If the yang qi’s lineage is severed and cut off, it is a great grievance to Heaven. If yin does not receive transformation and cannot generate, it is a great fault. The grievance of Heaven lies in yang’s failure to bestow, leaving nothing to be born, and instead favoring the killing and harming of life. The fault of Earth lies in yin’s failure to receive transformation, leaving nothing to be born and nourished, and instead harming and injuring what should be nurtured. Heaven that does not send timely rain is an evil and inauspicious Heaven; Earth that does not generate and nourish the myriad things is an evil and inauspicious Earth. Men who do not bestow generation sever Heaven’s lineage; women who do not receive transformation sever Earth’s lineage. The severance of the Dao of yin and yang, leaving no posterity, is a great inauspiciousness—like Heaven and Earth being destroyed in a single day, never to exist again. Therefore, the sages cherish the essential patterns of Heaven.

Heaven is the essence of all Dao. The worthy cherish the Dao, thus they follow the sages. The worthy enter the true Dao, thus they follow the immortals. Those who know how to become immortals must be true, thus they follow the true. Those who know the true must attain the divine. The divine, above, share the same form and principle as Heaven, thus Heaven is called divine, for it can make the divine manifest. The divine are the officers of the August Heaven. The divine person is the first heart of the August Heaven. The nature of Heaven and Earth is that the pure governs the turbid; the turbid cannot govern the pure. The radiant essence is the heart of the myriad things. Those who govern with clarity use their hearts to examine affairs, and should employ purity and brightness.

Now, what do the divine person, true person, immortal, Daoist, sage, worthy, common people, servants, and slaves resemble? The divine person resembles Heaven, which moves and illuminates without fail. The true person resembles Earth, which is utterly sincere and does not deceive Heaven, merely following what people sow without alteration. The immortal resembles the four seasons, which transform all things, having no constant form, now flourishing, now declining. The Daoist resembles the five phases, which can divine good and ill fortune, excelling in discerning safety and danger. The sage resembles yin and yang, which emulate Heaven and Earth to govern affairs, harmonizing the myriad things. The sage should also harmonize the myriad things, fulfill the heart of Heaven, and act in accord with yin and yang.

The worthy resembles mountains and rivers, which govern the flow of qi and reach distant lands; the worthy should likewise enable the emperor and king to communicate with the six directions. Common people resemble the myriad things, for the myriad things grow without regard to high or low, and all have their people—thus they resemble the myriad things. Servants and slaves arise in degenerate ages, resembling the weak and submissive among grasses and trees, ever dwelling in the lower currents, thus unable to rise; servants and slaves likewise dwell below and thus cannot rise—hence they resemble grasses and trees.

Therefore, when servants and slaves who are worthy cultivate goodness, they may become good people; good people who diligently study may become worthy; the worthy who study without cease may approach sagehood; sages who study without cease may know the gateways of the Heavenly Dao, and those who enter the Dao without cease may accomplish the work of immortality and ascend as immortals; immortals who do not cease may enter truth and become perfected; the perfected who do not cease may enter divinity and become divine; and the divine who do not cease may assume the same form as August Heaven. Thus the supreme divine person dwells in the Purple Palace of the North Pole, sharing the same form as the Heavenly Thearch, named the Heavenly Heart Spirit. If the divine do not cease, they may transcend Heaven and ascend further, merely receiving and transmitting qi, possessing a voice to teach and transform yet lacking form, belonging to the realm above Heaven and concerning themselves with the affairs of Heaven above.

From the divine person downward, all share concern for the six directions within Heaven and Earth, together harmonizing them to prevent suffering and distress.

[Appendix]
The *Zhengyi Fawen* and *Taishang Wailu Yi* quote the *Classic of Great Peace*, stating: Servants and slaves who obey their lords and study goodness may become worthy, thereby escaping to become good people and good citizens; good citizens and good people who study without cease may become worthy; the worthy who study without cease may become sages; sages who study without cease may become Daoists; Daoists who study without cease may become immortals; immortals who study without cease may become perfected; the perfected who study without cease may become great divine persons; and great divine persons who study without cease may become qi-transmitting divine persons.

We wish to know: among the boundless and immeasurably distant six directions between Heaven and Earth, what is most excellent? Among the thirty-six thousand realms between Heaven and Earth, longevity is most excellent. Thus Heaven is first, Earth second, the divine person third, the perfected fourth, the immortal fifth, the Daoist sixth, the sage seventh, and the worthy eighth. These eight all accord with the heart of August Heaven, sharing its will and joining its power—all are Heavenly persons. Heaven desires their service and assigns each to their proper office within it, so their thoughts and considerations are ever alike—these are the people Heaven cherishes and nurtures.

Heaven greatly desires long life and constant generation; immortals likewise desire long life and generation. Those who desire life dare not act wrongly, each calculating for their own being.

**The Art of Severing Metal: Military Strategy, Scroll Ninety-Nine**

The Six Perfected Ones of Equal Purity bow twice and respectfully address [the Heavenly Master]: "We wish to inquire about the laws of Heaven but dare not speak hastily. May the August Heavenly Master grant us the gateway, allowing us to voice our words?"

"Speak. Let no doubt remain."

"Very well. Now, it is only the Heavenly Master who can resolve the inherited disasters of emperors and kings, crafting institutions below to exalt the sovereign and thoroughly eradicate all calamities, omens, anomalies, and inauspicious phenomena under Heaven. We, the foolish students, wish to assist Heaven, that the qi of Great Yang may shine ever brighter, the emperor’s glory daily increase, treacherous cunning be extinguished, evil men be unable to act, thieves and bandits vanish, and malevolent spirits hide themselves, never again to arise. May we hear of this?"

"Excellent is the question of the Six Disciples! Heaven commands the Perfected Ones to speak. Very well. When the noble lord is without worry, petty men and treacherous ministers dare not act. Victory has already emerged, and disasters will naturally cease. Now, I shall fully expound the celestial standard for all disciples, ensuring not a fraction is lost. Follow and record it yourselves."

"Very well."

"Thus, the laws of Heaven manifest in celestial signs. The sages of antiquity constantly mirrored them, never daring to deviate. Therefore, they always suppressed the inauspicious, severed treachery, and prevented treacherous ministers from acting—all by adhering to the laws of Heaven. Their aim was to make the yang qi daily flourish, the fire grow ever brighter, and know no time of decline. This is achieved by urgently cutting off the qi of metal, preventing it from ruling. When the qi of metal is severed, the qi of wood may rule, and the qi of fire will blaze brightly without end."

"What does this mean?"

"Thus, the lord of men must urgently abolish weapons. Weapons belong to the category of metal, and so they must be urgently abolished. Now, contrary to this, rulers often bestow blades and arms upon their ministers—weapons, which are of metal, are thus granted dominion by the emperor. This dominion is called the ‘rule of metal.’ When metal rules, it suppresses wood and weakens fire. When metal rules, it causes the qi of the Wood phase, Jia and Yi, to wither. If the qi of Yi is severed, fire will not shine. When wood rules, earth cannot be born. If fire does not shine, the qi of earth will daily increase, the qi of the earth will frequently stir, and inauspicious omens will arise. Therefore, weapons and metal objects must be urgently abolished to suppress and eradicate these ills."

"Heaven’s aversion is no different from that of the spirits. We wish to know: why does the flourishing of metal suppress wood, and in turn cause fire to decline?"

"Excellent is your challenging question! It may be called an entry into the Dao. The Perfected Ones delight in knowing its great effects. Thus, when metal weapons are raised in spring, they injure the Jia-Yi Wood phase, causing the Azure Emperor of Heaven to be displeased and the Vermilion Emperor to rage greatly. Bing, Ding, Si, and Wu will not follow their course. Desiring to avenge the grievance against their parents, they cause the Fire phase to act, generating many calamities, anomalies, inauspicious omens, malevolent harms, and treacherous cunning. The law thus causes fire to govern in chaos—how can this be allowed? The great fault lies here."

"Excellent! Excellent! We wish to know: why must there be so many treacherous ministers, cunning men, thieves, and bandits?"

"Let me explain again for the Perfected Ones, that you may clearly understand. According to the standard laws of Heaven, when parents are harmed by bandits, their children must avenge them. Those who seek vengeance inevitably gather the inauspicious. Only deceitful, cunning, and unprincipled youths are capable of vengeance and rebellion. Thus, when metal weapons are bestowed, they suppress wood, and the governance of fire cannot be pacified. This is the constant standard of Heaven’s laws—it cannot be altered for old acquaintances. If the Six Perfected Ones doubt my words, then urgently sever all metal weapons. Whoever dares to wield them shall bear grave punishment. Immediately, fire disasters will be eradicated, governance will be swiftly pacified, and all under Heaven will say, ‘Excellent!’ The reason is this: fire represents the lord of men, and thus its anomalies are the most severe. The other four phases cannot compare. If you wish to further know its clear effects, observe the blazing star among the five planets—its anomalies are the most severe. The other four stars cannot compare. Heed my words and writings; the laws of Heaven do not err by even a fraction."

"Very well."

[Appendix] When the emperor bestows weapons upon the feudal lords, this is the ascendance of the metal *qi*. When metal *qi* ascends, wood declines; when wood declines, fire dims; and when fire dims, the omen of armed uprising arises. Fire represents the ruler’s symbol, capable of altering the four seasons. Among the five planets, the Blazing Star’s anomalies are the most evident—Heaven’s laws do not err by even a fraction.

"Proceed. For the Six Perfected Ones, I shall once more expound Heaven’s laws in full clarity. Thus, when metal *qi* is entirely eradicated and severed, wood *qi* attains great ascendance, pressing down upon the earth phase. Yellow *qi* cannot arise, and so in spring, wood reigns while earth perishes. Therefore, in spring alone, Heaven forcibly severs metal *qi* at *wu*, allowing wood to flourish and fire *qi* to grow radiant the following day. Then metal *qi* is imprisoned, and the cunning are cut off. When metal is imprisoned, water *qi* rests, and yin does not dare harm yang, allowing life below to thrive. Be vigilant against calamities and anomalies. When wood *qi* reigns without metal, it can fully exercise its office, and earth *qi* dies. The people and ministers grow loyal, reverent, and trustworthy, daring not to transgress—this is the unalterable decree of Heaven’s laws. Do you understand this constant nature and course of Heaven and Earth?"

"Indeed."

"Proceed. You have now grasped it. I shall once more clarify Heaven’s laws for the Six Perfected Ones, that they may... [text missing]. Now, the realm follows the way of arms—this is metal *qi*. Moreover, some rulers, at the year’s beginning, bestow blades and weapons, or during tours of inspection in all directions, reverse course and grant metal arms. The ruler, being king, by bestowing metal weapons upon others, is called ‘king of metal.’ When metal reigns, water becomes minister; when metal reigns, it harms wood; when water becomes minister, it harms fire. The northwest is yin; the southeast is yang. When lesser yin attains kingship and greater yin attains ministership, this is called the two *qi* jointly overpowering yang. Disasters arise below, the cunning commit transgressions, yin *qi* stirs, and deceitful words proliferate, giving rise to bandits—this is Heaven’s unalterable law. Do the Six Perfected Ones understand?"

"Indeed."

""

"The Six Perfected Ones already understand this—revere Heaven’s law."

"Indeed."

"Now I wish to ask: the southeast is yang, so why is it called the ‘earthly gate’? And the northwest is yin, yet why is it called the ‘heavenly gate’?"

"Ah. Gates and doors are where the *qi* of Heaven and Earth first arises, and where all things enter and exit. Thus, the southeast is extreme yang; extreme yang generates yin, so the southeast is called the ‘earthly gate.’ The northwest is extreme yin; yin at its extreme generates yang, so it is called the ‘heavenly gate.’ If the Perfected Ones wish to see proof: when the first yang line (*chū jiǔ*) begins at *jiǎzǐ*, and the first yin line (*chū liù*) begins at *jiǎwǔ*, this is what it means. Thus, the Dao of Heaven is like a cycle—when it completes its circuit, it returns to the beginning. How could it ever cease? When a true king governs, the subtle *qi* follows and arises in turn."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Let me further explain one matter to the Six Perfected Ones. When a ruler greatly mobilizes arms, it causes the phase of wood to be severely alarmed and depleted of *qi*, allowing earth to ascend as king. When earth reigns, metal becomes its great minister. When metal is a great minister, it causes weapons and armor to be frequently deployed, and the *qi* of *gān duì* stirs. In the northwest, barbarians, cunning bandits, and thieves arise in great numbers—this is the natural law. Even the spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot prevent it. Therefore, one must urgently suppress and sever metal implements, allowing no opportunity for them to flourish."

"Excellent! Excellent! Having heard the Master expound Heaven’s law, I now understand its awesome power."

"If you understand and revere it, good fortune will follow."

"Now, the August Heaven and Illustrious Master, in compassion for my ignorance and blindness, unable to grasp the Dao, has thoroughly explained Heaven’s law. Is this teaching intended solely for the sake of one ruler’s reign? Or does this law apply universally to all under Heaven?"

"Indeed, this is Heaven’s unchanging standard. However, if the phases of wood or fire arise recklessly, or if metal’s peaks cause coins and weapons to reign repeatedly, bringing great harm and making governance difficult to stabilize—should metal’s *qi* attain great kingship, the harm would be severe. Yet one who aligns with my Heavenly law and severs it will immediately attain good fortune. Governance will flourish, treacherous ministers will vanish, and Heaven’s law does not deceive."

"I wish to hear the essential meaning of Heaven’s standard."

"Ah, how thorough are the Six Perfected Ones’ questions! Now, Heaven and Earth regard the east as lesser yang, the beginning of the ruler’s birth, hence the sun rises in the east. The south is greater yang; greater yang is the ruler, thus *lí* (fire) is the sun, and the sun is the ruler. The south is fire, and fire is the ruler. Summer, in the south, nurtures and fosters growth most abundantly among the four seasons, where gestation and flourishing reach their peak—its virtue is greatest, so it is the ruler. This is the standard. Nevertheless, the note *jué* (wood) belongs to the east, and the position of fire belongs to the south. Now, as the *qi* of Great Peace flourishes, Heaven will exalt yang *qi*. Having seen the Six Perfected Ones’ questions, I know you are sent by Heaven, so I have fully explained the methods for exalting the greater yang ruler’s conduct. Perfected Ones, take heed."

"Indeed."

"The King’s Method of Bestowing Gifts, Scroll One Hundred

Today, Master Xin, moved by pity for the ignorant, has fully expounded the celestial methods. Yet I wish to ask one further matter.

When the emperor meets with his ministers and, extending downward, the common people—by celestial law, as the father and mother of the people, when he meets his ministers, they are the worthy sons of the king, thus they assist the king in governing Heaven and Earth. The common people are the unworthy sons who remain at home, tasked with cultivating the fields and managing livelihoods. When the king meets with them, there ought to be something he can bestow upon them. If he does not bestow gifts, then his grace and love will not extend to the people and ministers, leaving the infant-like subjects without the Dao to recite. What is to be done?"

"Excellent indeed, Perfected One, is your question.

Now, when meeting the worthy, bestow upon them *wen* (pattern/literature); when meeting the hungry, bestow food; when meeting the cold, bestow clothing."

"Why bestow *wen* upon the worthy?"

"The reason for bestowing *wen* is this: *Wen* arises in the east and flourishes in the south. Thus, celestial *wen* arises in the northeast, and so scripture emerges from the northeast, where Heaven reveals its signs. The tiger bears *wen* and dwells in *yin* (the third earthly branch); the dragon bears *wen* and dwells in *chen* (the fifth earthly branch). Carried upward to Heaven, *lí* (fire) becomes the patterns of *wen* in the southern march. Thus, the Three Luminaries embody *wen*, and the sun is the greatest illumination. Therefore, *wen* arises in the east and flourishes in the south—hence the sun rises in the east and flourishes in the south. Heaven commands the emperor to model himself upon Heaven as his standard. Thus, he ought to bestow *wen* to promote its flourishing.

The greater yang is the movement of fire. When the sun rises, fire can distinguish and perceive *wen* as right or wrong. *Wen* is also the means to record right and wrong under Heaven."

"Excellent indeed! Excellent indeed!"

"Go forth, Six Perfected Ones, for you have now awakened to the great Dao of Heaven."

"Now, the Radiant Master of August Heaven has fully expounded the celestial methods, leaving nothing obscure. We wish to know: with what *wen* ought the bestowal be made?"

"Profound indeed, Six Disciples, are your questions on Heaven’s behalf. It should be thus: in all matters, one often suffers from [lacuna], yet delights in emulating celestial law to swiftly attain Great Peace. Simply gather the true Daoist texts of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, select the most excellent among them, and compile them into a celestial canon. Bestow this upon the assembled worthies, so that each may depart and recite it. Now, considering the essential meaning of past and present, what is the great principle for transforming the people and ministers? It is to nurture their nature, settle their bodies, and in this way, the great worthies and scholars will all rejoice. Without malice, each will come to know and reflect upon the laws of Heaven and Earth, thereby causing people to revere and love their ruler above, cherish their own lives, and deeply understand how rare and precious a wise ruler is. Among them, the great worthies and benevolent ones will constantly fear their ruler’s aging and seek out extraordinary and uncommon methods, which they will then present to the emperor. Thus, the proper gift is the texts of the Dao."

"Excellent indeed! Excellent indeed!"

"You have now understood."

"Now, if one takes the easy path and bestows upon them weapons, armor, gold, and goods, they will return and each pursue profitable affairs. This will lead those above to cultivate martial qi, and the influence will spread to the foolish common people. Thus, profitable affairs will arise, warfare will erupt, gold will reign, cunning and deceit will flourish, bandits and thieves will emerge, gold will dominate, harming the Wood phase, and disrupting the Fire qi—this is the natural pattern of Heaven’s laws. Do you understand this?"

"Yes, yes. I wish to ask: why not bestow upon them other texts and scriptures?"

"Indeed, other books are not the true texts of the Dao. They would confuse worthy scholars and offer no benefit to governance, nor do they nurture one’s nature. As for the classics, they are superficial; if worthy scholars recite them daily, they cannot be given. However, one may select from the excellent classics of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity to compile texts for bestowal. Yet, I fear these are not the Way of nurturing one’s nature, causing people to fail in self-respect and instead indulge in mere literature. Nevertheless, all good texts may be bestowed so that they may recite, study, and emulate them, thereby transforming toward goodness."

"Excellent indeed! Excellent indeed!"

"The six disciples have now awakened to this."

*Principles of Prosperity and Decline Determined by Human Action, One Hundred and One*

"Now the Master graciously addresses this foolish student. I venture to ask: when one bestows food upon the hungry and clothing upon the cold, what is the intent? Indeed, the hungry yearn for food, the cold for clothing—once this heart-knot is tied, they will think of their lord and king, never forgetting even in old age. They will strive to repay with all their strength, never daring to harbor divided loyalty. Gratitude and affection will permeate the people, so that if they obtain any extraordinary, exceptional methods or virtuous texts, they will not dare conceal them. They will think only of presenting them to their ruler, that he may enjoy long life. Thus, this is why one should bestow such gifts—this is called ‘assisting the destitute and rescuing the urgent.’

The worthy delight in texts, the hungry in food, the cold in clothing. For a ruler to bestow upon his ministers and people, he must ensure each receives what they desire, and then the world will be content and submit. Excellent indeed! Excellent indeed!

Thus, by nature, the highest is virtue and Dao, and the lowest is punishment. Therefore, the East is for the Dao, the South for virtue. The Dao governs life, so all things are born in the East. Virtue governs nurturance, so all things are nourished in the South. The celestial model decrees that all things归属 to virtue and Dao. Thus, the myriad things all emerge from the southeast and ascend, for heaven and earth’s four directions and six yang qi together bring forth life in chen and si. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

Heaven’s law imposes punishment below, thus the northwest is ruled by lesser yin and greater yin, which bring penal calamity. Penal calamity governs harm and killing. Therefore, things wither, age, and decline in the West, and die in the North. When heavenly qi contends in battle, and the six yin lack yang, all things hide in inner caves, fearing punishment and calamity, not daring to emerge. The Dao of Heaven abhors what lies below, thus its creatures all feed on what is foul and discarded.

Therefore, the sages of antiquity, observing Heaven’s clear law, exalted the true Dao, virtuous power, and wondrous texts, while placing martial force below—this is the manifest model. Now, penal calamity and martial force arise in the northwest and are exalted, which is called yin overpowering yang, the base overpowering the noble, and leads to frequent strife. It causes ministers and people to be disloyal, brings no benefit to the king’s governance—how can such rule not be difficult? Do you, Perfected One, understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"You may be said to have awakened. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity always exalted the Dao, virtue, and texts, placing them in the highest and most excellent position, while weapons, armor, and war preparations were placed below. When one dwells alone, texts are placed upon the bed, while weapons lie beneath it. In this way, the barbarians submit of themselves, and bandits vanish day by day."

"Excellent indeed! Excellent indeed!"

"Go forth—you may be said to have truly understood."

"Let the Six Disciples ponder deeply the meaning of my writings and present them to a ruler of the highest virtue, that they may be shown to all worthies. My words do not betray the enlightened clarity of Heaven and Earth.

Go now—the minor discourse is concluded. If other matters remain unclear, return again to ask."

"Yes, yes."

"Now the Six Perfected Ones, having received the Celestial Master’s stern teachings, have respectfully returned each to their secluded abodes to reflect upon his words. Yet all harbor doubts—may the Celestial Master reveal the decisive principle to them."

"What is it you would say?"

"Today, Heaven naturally possesses the qi of the four seasons, and Earth naturally possesses the positions of the five phases. Their phases of ascendance, prosperity, decline, imprisonment, and abandonment follow their own times—yet it is only people who activate and employ them. How then can one compel their vital qi to arise, causing the phases of ascendance and prosperity to clash and destroy one another?"

"Tsk, tsk! Alas! Though you study daily, it is of no benefit—you have instead grown more foolish, scarcely different from the ignorant. Why is this?

The laws of Heaven and Earth decree that the rise and fall of the myriad things follow human agency. Whatever people collectively engage with and value, whatever they employ—all become ascendant and vital. What people abandon and discard all decline and become imprisoned. Thus, whatever people promote becomes their ruler, leader, or master; whatever they contend over becomes noble and beyond measure; whatever they abandon becomes base and without worth.

Therefore, what the world’s people promote and employ becomes ascendant and vital of itself—it need not await the qi of the four seasons or the five phases. Thus, the law of Heaven decrees that the rise and fall of people determine the rise and fall of the myriad things, and their nobility or baseness depend entirely upon human agency.

Therefore, the sages of antiquity understood the celestial pattern and knew it could not be rashly violated. In the high antiquity, people deeply revered the Dao, employed the Dao, and promoted the Dao—thus the Dao reigned. In the middle antiquity, when it was abandoned and not practiced, the Dao declined and became imprisoned, no longer seen as noble. In the middle antiquity, when virtue was promoted and employed, virtue reigned. In the lower antiquity, when the highest virtue was abandoned, virtue again declined and became imprisoned.

Thus, when people promote and employ culture, culture reigns; when they promote and employ martial power, martial power reigns; when they promote and employ gold and coin, gold and coin reign; when they promote and employ wealth and goods, wealth and goods reign. Whatever the world’s people promote and employ becomes ascendant and vital of itself—what they collectively abandon and do not use all become ordinary things. Why must one await the ascendance of Heaven’s four seasons and Earth’s five phases before something may reign?

Why, in your studies, do you not grow ever clearer, but instead sink deeper into darkness and ignorance? If even Perfected Ones think thus, how much more do the common people violate Heaven’s prohibitions, insisting otherwise—just as you have done.

Now, to compare you to them: your ignorance is uniquely long-standing. If my words resemble my exposition of Heaven’s laws, or my explanation to a virtuous ruler of how to bear the burden of the former kings’ accumulated disasters—would they mislead people and prove unusable? If they mislead, how could they be relied upon?

If the Six Disciples still harbor doubts and wish to know the great efficacy of my Way, to discern whether it is truly true or not, then swiftly present it to a wise and virtuous ruler, that he may put it into practice. It will immediately resonate with Heaven and Earth like an echo—this will be the clear proof and verification.

Yet even now, Perfected Ones cannot deeply comprehend this—how then can people determine the rise and fall, advance and retreat of things? Compared to you, the common people differ little from the blind in their darkness."

"Now that the Celestial Master has distinguished and explained this to us foolish students, we understand. We have erred—have we not?"

"Since you are students, you ought to devote yourselves to pondering the essential meaning, not merely reciting the words. To know the decisive principle is what Heaven, Earth, and the Dao resent in those who fail to grasp it. Again, learners must refine and guard this carefully."

"Yes, yes."

"Go now, and remember these celestial principles of governance. They can suppress cunning and malevolence, and prevent a virtuous ruler from losing the cultural patterns of governance."

"Yes, yes."

**Tai Ping Jing Collated Edition, Scroll 66, Ding Section 15**
**Tai Ping Jing, Scroll 66**
**The Three-Five Superiority and Inferiority Formula, One Hundred and Two**

The profoundly benighted and foolish, their days filled with unknowing, the obscurely born kneel and bow twice, asking of a great doubt.

"What is it?"

"Throughout the text, it is repeatedly said that the qi of the Celestial August Ones descends—yet to this day, we do not understand what is meant by 'the qi of the August Ones.'"

"You have indeed grasped the profound doubt in this; it may be said you have attained the meaning of the Dao. Listen well, and I shall fully expound it for you, Perfected One.

**〈Beginning〉**
Heaven has its Three August Ones, Earth has its Three August Ones, and humankind has its Three August Ones.
Heaven has its Five Emperors, Earth has its Five Emperors, and humankind has its Five Emperors.
Heaven has its Three Kings, Earth has its Three Kings, and humankind has its Three Kings.
Heaven has its Five Hegemons, Earth has its Five Hegemons, and humankind has its Five Hegemons.

"What does this mean?"

"Heaven’s Three August Ones are like the Three Luminaries; Earth’s Three August Ones are like high, low, and level terrain; humankind’s Three August Ones are like ruler, minister, and people. Heaven’s Five Emperors are like the Five Stars; Earth’s Five Emperors are like the Five Peaks; humankind’s Five Emperors are like the Five Phases and the Five Viscera.

**〈End〉** **〈Beginning〉**
Heaven’s Three Kings are like the Three Luminaries; Earth’s Three Kings are like high, low, and level terrain; humankind’s Three Kings are like ruler, minister, and people.
Heaven’s Five Hegemons are like the Five Stars; Earth’s Five Hegemons are like the Five Peaks; humankind’s Five Hegemons are like the Five Phases and the Five Viscera.

"Celestial Master, take pity on us foolish students. Though it is not our place, you have shown us the celestial pattern. We wish to hear of their superiority and inferiority."

"Excellent is your difficult question! It may be said you have grasped the celestial intent, entering the heart of Heaven—this shall remain bound and fixed for ten thousand generations, never to depart.

Now, Heaven’s Three August Ones: the superior are like the sun, the middling like the moon, and the inferior like the stars—thus vast is the disparity in their superiority and inferiority.
Earth’s Three August Ones: the superior are like the Five Peaks, the middling like level land, and the inferior like low-lying fields—thus vast is the disparity in their superiority and inferiority.
Humankind’s Three August Ones: the superior are like the ruler, the middling like the minister, and the inferior like the people—thus vast is the disparity in their superiority and inferiority.

**〈End〉** **[Appendix]**
Heaven’s Three Kings are the Three Luminaries; its Five Hegemons are the Five Peaks—this is the same for humankind and Earth.

Heaven’s Three August Ones: the superior are the sun, the middling the moon, the inferior the stars.
Earth’s Three August Ones: the superior are the Five Peaks, the middling level land, the inferior fields and wilds.
Humankind’s Three August Ones: the superior are the ruler, the middling the minister, the inferior the people.

Heaven’s Five Emperors: the superior are as if three parts of the sun in four; the middling are as if three parts of the moon in four; the inferior are as if three parts of the stars in four.
Earth’s Five Emperors: the superior are as if three parts of the Five Peaks in four; the middling are as if three parts of level land in four; the inferior are as if three parts of low-lying fields in four.
Humankind’s Five Emperors: the superior are as if three parts of a great state in four; the middling are as if three parts of a great minister in four; the inferior are as if three parts of the people in four.

Heaven’s Three Kings: the superior are as if two parts of the sun in four; the middling are as if two parts of the moon in four; the inferior are as if two parts of the great stars in four.
Earth’s Three Kings: the superior are as if two parts of the Five Peaks in four; the middling are as if two parts of level land in four; the inferior are as if two parts of low-lying fields in four.
Humankind’s Three Kings: the superior are as if two parts of a great state in four; the middling are as if two parts of a great minister in four; the inferior are as if two parts of the people in four.

Heaven’s Five Hegemons: the superior are as if one part of the sun in four; the middling are as if one part of the moon in four; the inferior are as if one part of the great stars in four.
Earth’s Five Hegemons: the superior are as if one part of the Five Peaks in four; the middling are as if one part of level land in four; the inferior are as if one part of low-lying fields in four.
Humankind’s Five Hegemons: the superior are as if one part of a great state in four; the middling are as if one part of a great minister in four; the inferior are as if one part of the people in four.

This is the Dao of Heaven, not far off—each of the Three and Five reflects itself.

Thus, Heaven has its Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons; Earth likewise has its Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons; and humankind likewise has its Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons."

"Why is there this unity and multiplicity? We wish the Celestial Master to explain the essential meaning of this formula."

"Now, Heaven, Earth, and humankind originally share the same primordial qi, divided into three forms, each with its own ancestral origin.

Thus, the Three August Ones are the ancestral heads; the Five Emperors are the rulers of their flourishing middle period; the Three Kings are the rulers of their level and stable era; the Five Hegemons are the qi of their final decline, inferiority, and exhaustion—of perilous disorder and punitive governance.

Thus, when it comes to the Five Hegemons, they possess but one part in four, for the celestial pattern is nearly severed. Beyond this, the inferior are too weak to restrain one another—like the greatly weak unable to control the strong, the yielding unable to control the firm, the few unable to control the many. The Dao is on the verge of great chaos, no longer able to govern itself."

Thus, it rises again from above.

What does this mean?

Indeed, the Nine August Ones all first sprout in the north; the Five Emperors first emerge in the east; the Three Kings flourish in the south; and the Five Hegemons reach their withered completion in the west. Heaven generates all things: yang qi follows primordial qi, merging with the Great Yin to sprout and grow. As life ought to emerge and unfold, it flourishes in the east; having emerged, it ought to thrive, thus it prospers in the south; having thrived, it ought to bear fruit, thus it withers and completes in the west. The Dao of heaven and earth, of yin and yang, is entirely cyclical.

Yet things cannot remain in fruition—death alone awaits. The seeds of roots and fruit must rise again; thus, yin and yang together enter the Gate of Heaven, unite their qi in the stem, and begin anew from above. This is the natural nature of heaven and earth.

Excellent! Excellent! Why then do heaven, earth, and humanity not share the same Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons?

Excellent indeed—your question grasps its meaning. Heaven, earth, and humanity are divided into three domains, each dwelling apart. The Way of the August Ones is like a household having a father; the Way of the Emperors, like a household having a mother; the Way of the Kings, like a household having a son; and the Way of the Hegemons, like a household having a daughter-in-law. Now, if the three households dwell apart, how can they share the same father, mother, son, and daughter-in-law? Just as people divided into three households cannot share the same parents, children, and daughters-in-law—do you, Perfected One, understand?

Indeed, indeed.

Be cautious—do not recklessly raise objections. The Dao of heaven has its own fixed and constant laws; one must not forcibly oppose them, nor dare to act with coercive strength.

Indeed, indeed. Though I ask about each matter, I fear transgressing the Master’s taboos; yet if I do not ask, there is no way to know. Might I beg one more word?

Proceed.

Now, there are forty-eight divisions—how do these forty-eight divisions operate?

Excellent—how thorough your questioning!

Those whose governance aligns with the heart-mind of heaven prevent calamities from arising. Those who lose the essential Dao of heaven ensure calamities never cease. Thus, for myriad generations before and after, they inherit and bear one another’s burdens. A ruler who excels in virtue can cause disasters and faults to subside on their own, dissolving their transgressions. Yet those who neglect the essential Dao of self-cultivation instead allow perverse qi to spread, circulating throughout the world. Thus, these residual calamities reverse course, becoming the inescapable convergence of inherited burdens.

What does this mean?

Listen carefully to my words.

Indeed, indeed.

The ruler above in heaven is like the sun; the middling, like the moon; the lowest, like the stars. The ruler above on earth is like the Five Peaks; the middling, like level land; the lowest, like low-lying fields. The ruler above among people is like the sovereign; the middling, like the ministers; the lowest, like the common folk. Where wholeness prevails, the people and the myriad things all remain free from illness and at peace, without thieves, bandits, deceit, or flattery. Heaven and earth know no calamities or anomalies—this is called supreme harmony, where wholeness prevails.

Where three of the four parts are intact, three parts of the people remain peaceful, good, loyal, and trustworthy, while one part suffers injury or death, or becomes thieves and bandits, collectively giving rise to perverse and strange transformations. The extent of these follows the measure of that one part in four.

Where two of the four parts are intact, half the people and the myriad things fall ill, act in bad faith, and half harbor deceitful hearts. Heaven’s strange anomalies likewise appear in half measure.

Where only one of the four parts is intact, three parts fall entirely into illness, falsehood, flattery, and banditry, devoid of any mutual benefit. Only one part remains good.

Heaven’s anomalies persist without cease, shifting from place to place, never departing from their allotted domains. Why is this so?

Excellent—your words are well said!

Where all four parts are complete, the Dao and its virtue extend to every part. What virtue reaches, it can govern—thus all things are wholly good, universally enveloped in its virtue and power, and so all remains harmonious.

Where three of the four parts are intact, virtue fails to reach one part, and thus one part turns inauspicious.

Where two of the four parts are intact, virtue’s coverage falls short by half, and thus half turns inauspicious.

Where only one of the four parts is intact, virtue is faint, barely reaching one part while failing the other three—thus three parts turn inauspicious.

Therefore, the sages and sovereigns of antiquity, wishing to discern their own strengths and weaknesses, used this as their divination, never erring even once.

Why do those beyond virtue’s reach fall ill?
Because virtue cannot extend to them, leaving them without governance or leadership. Without leaders, the myriad things descend into chaos, plagued by illness, deceit, cunning, and unceasing banditry.

The ancients used this to divine governance, gauging the depth of virtue. They observed which qi it aligned with, thereby deeply discerning the gains and losses, the rise and decline of rule—clear as the sun and moon.

Excellent! Excellent indeed!

How may these failures be remedied?
Excellent question! Now that you, Perfected One, have grasped the celestial principles, you must halt this flow of disasters and bear the burden of the myriad things.

How are disasters to be halted?
Only through the Celestial Master’s instruction of the worthy, enabling them to align with the qi of the Supreme Sovereign.

Indeed. Each should thoroughly examine the true Dao, reflect on the Primordial Unity to govern their own toil and affliction—thus restoring their excellence and ensuring all are encompassed.

Excellent! Excellent indeed!

Proceed, Perfected One, with the precepts.
Yes, yes. I have reverently received the forty-eight precepts.

How long or short is the practice of the Dao?
Your inquiry is most thorough.

I dare not be anything but thorough—the Way of Heaven is weighty, and the Master’s command is stern. Thus, I venture to ask in detail.

Excellent! You possess the diligence of a disciple and may thereby grasp the intent of the celestial Way.

Now, the celestial Way comprises three paths, corresponding to the Great Yang, the Great Yin, and the Balanced Harmony.

The most excellent follow the outer path; the next, the middle; the next, the inner. The hegemons, lacking the Dao, merely borrow the path.

The shortest route lies within the inner path of the Three Kings. The Supreme Sovereign, most excellent, follows the outermost path. The Nine Sovereigns share a single path in succession, with the lesser within and the greater stepping forward without haste.

The next move slightly; the next discern slightly. The Fifteen Emperors share a single middle path: the most excellent follow the outer, the next proceed with awareness, and the lesser advance swiftly.

The Three Kings and nine rulers share a single inner path, riding forward—the next move with slight urgency, and the lesser gallop.

The Fifteen Hegemons borrow the innermost extreme path: the most excellent seem to fly along the outer, the middle to fly swiftly, and the lesser to streak like an arrow.

Do you understand, Perfected One?

Excellent! Excellent indeed!

“Perfected One, why do you inquire into this matter so thoroughly?”

“Indeed, ever since my birth, I have wondered why the years alternately lengthen and shorten, why the days grow thicker and thinner, advancing and receding. Fearing I might never understand without asking the Heavenly Master, I wished to hear your explanation.”

“Excellent, your words are. Know then: the thickest are the days of Heaven; the next in thickness are the days of Earth; the next are the days of humanity; and the thinnest are the days of the myriad things. Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Go now, and ask no more of this. Such matters are your private concern, not because I would withhold explanation from you, but because the world has no use for them. They bring no benefit to the emperors’ burden of inherited misfortune or to the sorrows of the common people. Thus, I do not expound upon them for you—not out of reluctance, but because it is so.”

“Yes, yes. I have greatly transgressed the Heavenly Master’s taboos and committed a grave error.”

“It is not arrogance. Those who delight in knowing the affairs of Heaven above come with private curiosity, and so I have explained everything to you in full.”

“Yes, yes.”

“Go now.”

Here begins the section "Nine August Ones, Fifteen Emperors, Nine Kings, and Fifteen Hegemons: Methods for Assessing the Excellence or Inferiority of Their Conduct" from *The Comprehensive Collated Scripture of the Great Peace*, Scroll Sixty-Seven, Ding Section, Part Sixteen. *Scripture of the Great Peace*, Scroll Sixty-Seven: "Six Sins and Ten Governance Principles," Chapter One Hundred and Three.

---

The Perfected One stepped forward. “How many sins does an ordinary person commit?”

“An ordinary person who commits no transgressions—what sins could they have?”

“Ah! Perfected One, how benighted you are!”

“This foolish one is unenlightened. From birth, I have never heard that one who breaks no law could still bear sin.”

“Your words align with common belief. Yet do you not see that ordinary people bear six great, ineradicable sins? Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations. Have you truly studied without grasping these manifest sins? Are your studies not in vain?”

“This foolish one is suddenly awakened—it is no illness.”

“You remain only half-awake. Consider the common folk who die with grievances knotted in their hearts. Though they perish in ignorance, they awaken at death. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, people first remain blind, then later see—how can this be condemned? Now, listen well.

First: One accumulates the Dao without limit yet refuses to teach others to awaken and seek life. This sin cannot be erased. Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations. The reason? They sever the Dao of Heaven’s generation, becoming Heaven’s adversary.

Second: One accumulates virtue without limit yet refuses to earnestly teach others to guard virtue and nurture their nature with care. This sin cannot be erased. Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations. The reason? They sever Earth’s nurturing virtue, becoming Earth’s adversary—a grave transgressor.

Third: One amasses wealth by the millions yet refuses to relieve the destitute or aid the desperate, allowing people to die of hunger and cold. This sin cannot be erased. Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations. The reason? This wealth of harmony is the means by which Heaven and Earth enact benevolence, circulating and sustaining all to prevent hardship. Now, they hoard and cut it off, preventing its universal reach—becoming enemies of Heaven and Earth’s harmonious qi. Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations. Such wealth cannot be long retained; it must circulate.

Fourth: Heaven endows people with knowledge, inclining them to love good and hate evil. Yet, though blessed with understanding, they know Heaven possesses the Dao yet scorn it, refusing to study earnestly to save themselves. Though they might attain long life, inheriting the celestial mandate and their ancestors’ bodies, they instead treat themselves lightly, refusing to study and contemplate death. Suddenly facing death, they cry out in grievance—this sin cannot be erased. Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations, leaving them to perish in ignorance—becoming Heaven’s adversary. The reason? Heaven itself strives to practice the Dao, thus remaining eternally auspicious; losing the Dao brings misfortune and death. Though Heaven loves people and desires their goodness, embedding the Dao within them, they refuse to practice it earnestly. Such people are called ‘those without the Dao,’ and Heaven has no means to grant them the Dao and longevity. They sever the Dao of Heaven, thus becoming Heaven’s adversary.

Fifth: People are born knowing virtue and goodness yet refuse to study and cultivate virtue earnestly. Instead, they scorn virtue, despise nurturing it, and treat themselves lightly, embracing wrongdoing. This sin cannot be erased. Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations. The reason? They oppose Earth. Earth delights in virtue and nurtures it, yet these people neglect such matters, refusing to embrace virtue. They dishonor their ancestors’ bodies—becoming Earth’s transgressors.

Sixth: Heaven endows people with sinew and strength, enabling them to clothe and feed themselves. Yet they refuse to exert themselves, instead falling into hunger and cold, betraying their ancestors’ bodies. They squander their strength, refusing to work, though effort could secure clothing and food. Instead, they constantly lament their suffering and hunger, relying on the wealthy, begging to survive. This sin cannot be erased. Some incur punishment in this very life; others pass it on to future generations. The reason? Heaven and Earth generate all things to nurture people. Each should gather according to their strength, taking enough to avoid hardship. Yet they idle, refusing to work, treating themselves lightly. Or their demands are unreasonable, forcibly seizing others’ property—becoming enemies of harmony. Their sin clearly warrants death. These six great sins incur Heaven’s hatred; they cannot be erased.

Perfected One, do you understand?”

“Yes, yes. I beg the Heavenly Master to clarify: which of these sins is the gravest?”

“Ah! Why do you grow ever more foolish? These are sins that extinguish entire lineages—how can you ask which is gravest?”

“This foolish one is deeply perplexed and does not grasp the essential meaning. I beg the Heavenly Master to further enlighten me, that I may fully awaken, deeply understand, and never dare transgress again.”

“Very well. Your words are apt. My discourse shall now be revealed—Perfected One, you must follow closely and record it earnestly.”

“Yes, yes.”

Now, the August Heaven follows the Dao/Way to bring forth and nurture all common beings—every bustling kind looks up to its decree. Yet among great Daoists, some deeply comprehend in silence, treasuring this within their bellies, unwilling to exert themselves in teaching others.

To teach the Dao to others is like giving fire to them: if few come to take it, the source is not diminished; if countless come to take it, the source is still not diminished. Now, if we share it freely to instruct all under Heaven, we aid Heaven in generating beings, assist Earth in nurturing forms, and support the Emperor in rectifying governance. Moreover, if each person embraces the Dao, seeking life and detesting death, they will govern themselves and aid others, no longer transgressing laws or committing evil and violence.

With hearts turned to goodness, they assist Heaven, Earth, and the Emperor in nurturing the myriad beings—twelve thousand kinds—each delighting in long life. When people harbor benevolent hearts and no longer lightly harm or injure living things, Heaven will be greatly pleased, Earth will rejoice immensely, and the Emperor will be overjoyed, free from care. Is not the merit of such accumulation vast indeed?

If one person teaches and thus transforms a hundred foolish ones, and those hundred each teach ten thousand, and those ten thousand each teach a hundred million, then a hundred million will teach without end. This goodness ascends to harmonize with Heaven’s heart and descends to pervade the boundless; the people will all delight in life and in doing good. The Emperor, roaming without fixed duty, what harm could come to others that he would not strive to instruct and admonish?

Now, people are fortunate to receive the admonitions of former masters, deeply embracing the supreme Dao—yet they seal it away, refusing to teach and guide others. This leaves people with no refuge, forcing them to die unjustly with grievances unresolved. Such is called severing the Heavenly Dao. Many lose the Dao and act recklessly: Heaven cannot grant them long life, Earth cannot sustain their nurture.

People must know the Dao. Without it, the petty-minded grow careless, together committing rebellion, violating Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s principles, rising as bandits who harm and kill one another. They break the royal laws, causing the noble-minded deep sorrow, and chaos becomes unmanageable. The Emperor, day and night, ponders this with melancholy and bitter distress, causing Heaven and Earth to lose their proper order. Disasters and strange omens never cease, leaving the Emperor burdened with guilt—words cannot fully express it.

To sever the Heavenly Dao is the gravest of rebellious transgressions, beyond all reckoning. Thus, I have raised its essential principles to show the Perfected One right from wrong. Is it not clear that such heavy sins warrant death? Even among the dead, their transgressions may yet linger, flowing into future lives.

How grave! Perfected One, you must be vigilant.

Only the Perfected One knows this single truth—one may then be said to have attained enduring fortune and evaded all misfortune.

“Indeed, I dare not stray from your command.”

“Good. You are already wise and enlightened, understanding Heaven’s mandate. You shall surely transcend death and live on, without doubt.”

“Now, with reverence, I have heard the mandate of the Heavenly Dao. I wish to know the decree of Earth’s virtue.”

“Very well. Earth’s great virtue lies solely in following the Dao of Heaven, nurturing the myriad beings with kindness. All creatures, teeming and diverse, receive its grace and are raised to fulfillment within it. Thus, those of great virtue should model their conduct after this. By the merit of former masters, they may embrace and hold the boundless virtue of the good Dao.

Virtue teaches people as if one drinks from a vast river. When few come to learn virtue, it does not harm its essence; when those of boundless capacity come to learn virtue, it likewise does not harm its essence. If one teaches with diligence, all ordinary people may come to guard and embrace virtue, each cherishing and nurturing themselves.

The virtuous may assist Heaven above in nourishing and fostering life, and aid Earth below in rearing and maturing beings. All join in effort and unity, without malice. Among them, those of great wisdom, whose hearts are easily awakened, may be transformed and elevated to serve as the sovereign’s aides. The capable may become officials and teachers, while even the less discerning may serve as guides among the people. There is none who does not delight in the transformation of virtue and turn toward goodness.

Such teaching benefits Heaven above and Earth below—it is the very root of great transformation, aiding the Emperor in nurturing the people so they do not commit evil. The noble-minded may govern with ease, free from care. Their merit is vast, and Heaven and Earth cherish them, elevating them to office.

Yet now, some possess vast virtue but feign ignorance, blocking the path of the Dao. They do not aid Heaven in nurturing life, nor Earth in maturing beings, nor the Emperor in harmonizing the people. They leave later generations in darkness, ignorant, unable to distinguish black from white, stubborn in their ways, becoming petty men—adrift, reckless with their lives, following one another into wrongdoing. They hoard ill-gotten gains, and neither high nor low can teach one another. Bewildered and confused, they know no restraint. Above, they violate Heaven’s patterns; below, Earth’s forms. Their conduct rebels against the four seasons, disrupts the five phases, causing the noble-minded deep sorrow. They incite harm among the petty, become bandits and thieves, or bring ruin upon themselves, disgracing their parents, and thus perish without legacy.

Now, I have merely raised its essential principles to show the beginning, that all may awaken and spur themselves. Yet they refuse to teach enduring virtue—this is called severing Earth’s nurturing Dao. Such is their transgression. This is to die without form, and still, their sins linger, flowing into future lives. Does the Perfected One understand?”

“How grave! How grave!”

“If the Perfected One understands this early, it may be called attaining life while yet living. Only be vigilant.”

“Indeed, indeed. I have reverently received the prohibitions of the Dao and virtue, and now wish to hear of the conduct of the benevolent.”

“Now, all things of value that Heaven and Earth produce are bestowed upon humanity, rootless, neither clinging above to Heaven nor below to Earth. These things are the possession of harmonious qi, meant to circulate freely, floating and coming and going, duty-bound to relieve the destitute and aid the desperate. Those who hoard gold, silver, and treasures—families of vast wealth, with hundreds of millions or more—let their stores rot and decay. If the wise and discerning would distribute them to the poor, they would gain only the fleeting renown of benevolence. Yet this aids Earth in nurturing forms and assists the emperor in preserving the good and reverent among the people. A family of hundreds of millions could relieve ten thousand households, giving from the old to welcome the new, without a mind for hasty profit. Their virtue would permeate Heaven and Earth, their fame reach distant lands, and they would ever receive new goods while the rotting stores vanish. The greatest among the worthy daily report their deeds to the emperor; the lesser, to their villages. Among the most foolish, those who fail to repay kindness number only ten or twenty in a hundred—how could this impoverish anyone? If one persists in goodness, the great and wise will make it known, their name resounding throughout the land, so that those who follow the Way crowd the roads. When enlightened kings and sagely rulers hear of it, rejoicing in such aid to the people, they summon them, raising them to the highest offices. Thus they attain honor and nobility, their lineage unbroken for generations, becoming paragons of great benevolence, rare under Heaven. Above, they do not betray their ancestors; below, they do not fail their descendants. Heaven loves them, the hundred spirits favor them, and the emperor treats them as a trusted friend, while neighbors regard them as parents. Their merit is inscribed in Heaven and Earth, never to depart; their emoluments are tied to office, never to diminish; their name endures among the people, never to fade. How can one not practice benevolence?

Yet some chance upon fertile lands and the harmonious wealth of Heaven and Earth, amassing hundreds of millions, even billions, of treasures—gold and silver beyond count—only to seal and hide them in dark chambers, letting all rot. When the destitute come seeking aid, they curse and refuse; if they do grant something, they delay, demanding repayment with interest—sometimes doubling, sometimes quintupling it. They bestow upon the rich, cutting off the poor, letting them starve and freeze to death, scorning them instead of following reason. They incur Heaven’s enmity, Earth’s blame, and become the bitterest foes of humanity, despised by all spirits. Why? These treasures are the shared possession of Heaven and Earth’s harmonious qi, meant to nourish all people. Such families merely happen upon their accumulation, like rats in a granary, glutting themselves alone—yet the grain of the great storehouse was never meant for rats alone. The wealth of the treasury was never meant for one person. Those in need should all draw from it. The foolish, ignorant of this, believe they alone will possess it forever, unaware it is the tribute of ten thousand corpses, from which all should receive clothing and food. Their love turns to irrational anger and joy, refusing to relieve the destitute and aid the desperate, causing ten thousand households to perish. In spring, they have no seed; in autumn, no harvest. Their grievances rise in a chorus to Heaven. Heaven is moved, Earth stirred. To fail in aiding the worthy and relieving the desperate is to be the greatest of the unbenevolent between Heaven and Earth. If one refuses even the offerings of sacrifice, the hundred spirits loathe them, wishing their lineage to end. The village elders curse them, wishing their death. When bandits hear of it, they gather forces to assault their gates, leaving the household destitute and dying. Yet still they refuse to give, burying their wealth deep in the earth, hidden from sight. Without cause, they cut off the world’s resources, depriving the land of its use, instead strengthening the earth below. Heaven abhors them, Earth ails from them, deeming them a great calamity. The harmonious things of the world grow scarcer by the day, and thus they sit in want, while the starving and freezing multiply, becoming their bitterest foes.

Now, Heaven delights in the Dao, Earth delights in virtue, and harmony delights in benevolence. All things are duty-bound to reside between Heaven and Earth, circulating and providing for all. Yet when people are in need, their resources are buried, sick and stifled, unable to emerge and be seen. Heaven and Earth never desired wealth for themselves—Heaven delights in human life, Earth in human nurture. The ignorant petty person dams up the harmonious wealth of Heaven and Earth, preventing its circulation and sufficiency, killing what Heaven gives life to and plundering what Earth nurtures. Without cause, they bury and hide this wealth, impoverishing the state, depleting its resources, and failing to save the lives of its people. They leave virtuous rulers to govern in emptiness. Gold, silver, treasures, and goods are made for use, the labor of many people, truly toilsome. They should serve the nation’s needs, yet without cause, they are discarded, cast away from above and below. Earth, too, does not delight in them, deeming them a great affliction, a great burden. Now, the unbenevolence of the foolish is so grave—should they not die for it?

Among them are those suddenly insatiable, who quarrel and oppress, seizing the wealth of the weak and small without restraint. I have merely shown the Perfected One the essential principles, the beginning of this matter. The transgressions of the greatly unbenevolent are too many to recount, and their wealth is difficult to put to use. The Perfected One should ponder this deeply. Thus, the harmonious qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity despise them. Even in death, their sins remain, flowing into future lives. Does the Perfected One now understand?”

“Indeed, indeed. How grave!”

“I do not wish to hear of it.”
“The Perfected One discards such words, and Heaven will surely take your life, that you may awaken and know repentance—then you may yet live. Take heed and act with caution.”
“Indeed, indeed. I have reverently received the precepts of the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, and wish to hear why those with knowledge do not study the true Way.”

“Excellent are your words. When Heaven gives birth to humanity, it bestows upon them the good fortune of wisdom, that they may study and attain long life. Heaven possesses the Dao and delights in sharing it with people; Earth possesses virtue and delights in bestowing it upon them; the harmonious qi holds wealth and delights in nourishing all. Thus, when people joyfully seek the true Way, the Perfected Ones come of their own accord. If one persists without cease, it is as though conspiring with the spirits. Daily singing the praises of goodness, goodness naturally returns to them; diligently serving the multitude of worthies, the worthies together instruct and guide them—no distance remains. Thus may one preserve their body whole, not betraying the legacy of their ancestors, while others all meet early ends, alone attaining their full span of years; all others are called evil, while they alone are deemed good. Becoming a teacher to the multitudes, their name spreads to distant lands, inwardly cherishing the true Dao, virtue, and benevolence. They aid Heaven in giving life to creatures, aid Earth in nurturing forms, and aid the Emperor in transforming the people. The highest teachers may transform those without limit, ensuring even the foolish abide by the Dao and commit no wrong; middling teachers may transform ten thousand, and lesser teachers may transform hundreds or thousands, bringing benefit to the sovereign, making petty men know restraint and refrain from hidden wickedness. Above, they receive office without betraying their ancestors; below, they bring no shame to their descendants. Given such learning, how could one not pursue it? Thus, the sages and worthies of old all took the exhortation of learners as their greatest concern, aiding Heaven and Earth in generation and completion, assisting the Emperor in ordering chaos—this is the praise of good people between Heaven and Earth.

Yet there are foolish ones who, though born with aspirations and possessing knowledge, refuse to diligently study the true Way, instead delighting in superficial embellishments, acting to deceive others. As children, they deceive their parents; as subjects, they deceive their lord; as inferiors, they deceive their superiors—this is called deceiving Heaven, and their sins cannot be erased. Some instead delight in worldly affairs and strife, following one another in wrongdoing; when they see those who are true and genuine, they mock them greatly, saying there is no need to study. Thus they sink into darkness, their ignorance complete, delighting in dominance yet unable to attain it. They recklessly speak of Heaven and Earth without measure, deriding the worthies as ignorant, indulging their desires without restraint. Above, they offend the patterns of Heaven; below, they violate the principles of Earth. In their comings and goings, they observe no moderation; at home, they do not serve their parents. Gathering with the foolish multitude, they become wicked sons. When appointed as officials, they return to slay their parents, unable to reflect or consider, and so flee to become bandits, harming and killing people without cease. This is precisely what Heaven abhors, what Earth reproaches, what the Emperor grieves over, what the hundred spirits detest, and what leaves parents destitute. This is the great calamity that harms others, severing the lineage of their ancestors. If one does not diligently study the true Way and conducts themselves thus, in the eyes of the Perfected One, should they not die? Even in death, their sins remain, flowing to their descendants, who are still called the posterity of evil men, the heirs of bandits. Will their wickedness not flow into future lives? Now, I have merely shown the Perfected One the beginning of this matter—its evils are too many to recount, and their wealth is difficult to put to use. Does the Perfected One now understand?”

“Indeed, indeed. How grave!”
“If you understand this, you have already cast off evil.”
“I have reverently heard these four matters and wish to hear what follows.”

“Now, when Heaven gives birth to humanity, it endows them fully before sending them forth, ever delighting in their pursuit of the Dao and virtue. The benevolent, fortunate in their knowledge, may study virtue, for Heaven and Earth nurture the myriad things with virtue and delight in people emulating it. Thus, the virtuous of the most ancient times endured humiliation, emulating Earth’s nurturing of creatures. When people learn and practice this, their hearts and minds are ever joyful, no longer delighting in harm. They observe matters and act with caution, daily doing good, no longer desiring to do evil. Like attracts like, and day by day they ascend higher, their long practice culminating in the perfection of virtue. None do not respond to them, and the multitudes turn toward them. Persisting in reverent, compliant goodness without cease, they become great teachers, their virtue aiding Heaven in nurturing creatures that desire life, aiding Earth in nurturing creatures that desire growth, and delighting in assisting the enlightened king in transforming the people, making them reverent and no longer knowing wickedness. In small virtue, they may transform hundreds or thousands; in great virtue, they may transform ten thousand or more. Thus they cause ten thousand to become teachers of virtue, their transformations without limit. Persisting in virtue without cease, all people delight in them. Heaven and Earth love them, extending their years; ghosts and spirits favor them, together bringing them benefit and protection. Those with merit become the virtuous officials of the sovereign, delighting not in harming the multitudes. Delighting in and cherishing them, what they seek is attained, and they dwell in constant joy, with none desiring to harm them. This arises from learning compliance and goodness to cultivate virtue, thus reaching such heights. Their names spread to distant lands, their merits recorded in Heaven and Earth, not betraying their ancestors nor shaming their descendants.

Now, some are fortunate to possess knowledge and discern good from evil, yet they treat themselves lightly, refusing to diligently study and cultivate good virtue, instead following the ignorant and benighted in evil. They delight in martial prowess and forceful qi, their words ever harsh, their speech perverse, seeking to overpower others. They claim superiority, yet there are those superior to them; they boast of bravery and strength, yet there are those braver and stronger. Thus, in all matters under Heaven, each has its limit and exhaustion—this is how they may be controlled. When a great fire arises, it seems uncontrollable, yet with water it is extinguished. When one does evil and anger arises, it seems uncontrollable, yet with imprisonment it is exhausted.”

Those who wield their tongues as though unbounded will be humbled by illness.

Thus, Heaven and Earth govern humanity, each with its own measure and rule. Yet though humans possess knowledge, they refuse to study diligently, instead treating themselves lightly and committing wrongs. Their dwellings become inauspicious, and none love them. Heaven and Earth detest them, the hundred spirits abhor them, and even the emperor is grieved by them. Such men do not become good people but instead become bandits and thieves. Even in death, they remain malevolent spirits. Their violent strength avails them nothing in the end. The Dao of humanity is known to all, yet they treat it lightly and refuse to do good, defiling their ancestors’ legacy and failing their descendants. Thus, they are branded as wicked and predatory. None wish to speak with them; travelers avoid sharing their path. What fault is theirs alone? They bear the burden of their parents’ evil and are called the children of thieves and bandits. Some meet untimely deaths.

When the Perfected One comes, men still treat themselves lightly, refusing to study under enlightened teachers and cultivate virtue, instead following petty men. Their transgressions are such—would they not die with sins still unexpiated?

How dreadful! Master, you need not say more—I already ache with sorrow at the thought. To see men neglect study as a trifling matter, how could they know it leads to such ruin?

Men are so foolish, no different from the vulgar. They do not reflect deeply, yet death comes with sins still unpaid. Perfected One, you have rendered great service to Heaven and Earth—be vigilant.

Indeed.

One must not treat oneself lightly. I have merely outlined the essentials, shown the beginning—yet the evils of neglecting study are not exhausted here. When you receive my writings, awaken and reflect deeply.

Indeed.

If you return to a quiet place and study them carefully, all will become clear.

Just so. To study without precision—how is it different from dreaming?

Indeed. I have reverently received your instructions. Now, I wish to hear the teaching on why men, though endowed with strength, fail to use it rightly.

Very well. Heaven and Earth give life to all creatures that crawl and move, endowing each with strength. They draw qi from the four seasons and embody the five phases. Strength is fundamentally for self-movement and sustenance, providing clothing and food. Thus, those who constantly exert their strength, working day and night without respite, accumulate without ceasing—no matter how great or small the thing, they cherish what they obtain. All things possess their own spirit, and they, too, favor those who love them, coming to them of their own accord. It is like the Eastern Sea, which loves water and lies lowest, so that all waters under Heaven gather there, making it the sea. The noble man who labors without ceasing becomes a master of amassed wealth. His family grows prosperous, wanting for nothing. His ancestors receive fine offerings, his descendants enjoy abundance, and the entire household benefits. If he continues to exert himself without pause, the poor and destitute from all directions come to receive his aid, and his foundation grows ever stronger. If he ceaselessly gives, the people praise him greatly, his name spreads far and wide, and his merit is recorded in Heaven and Earth. By constantly aiding the destitute and relieving crises, he assists Heaven and Earth in cherishing all things and helps the ruler nourish the people. If he never ceases in rescuing the needy, Heaven increases his allotted years, and the hundred spirits all come to partake of his offerings. His household rejoices without exception. Through such virtuous conduct, he may attain high office, honoring his ancestors and not failing his descendants.

Yet some, though possessing strength, treat it lightly and do not take it seriously. Though they could attain wealth, they instead engage in quarrels and lawsuits, recklessly committing inauspicious acts. Seeing their strength overpower others, they persist without restraint, becoming great evildoers. Their families fall into utter destitution, and they turn to banditry. Hunger and cold assail them, and they cannot restrain themselves from wickedness. Among them, the most unworthy perish from starvation and exposure. Those who rely on brute strength harm others, seeking what is not theirs, seizing what does not belong to them, and repeatedly injuring people. They incur Heaven’s resentment, Earth’s blame, and the enmity of the noble. The emperor is grieved by them. If they persist without ceasing, the hundred spirits detest them and no longer bless them. Heaven does not wish to cover them, Earth does not wish to bear them. Calamities arise daily, and they die by the roadside, or languish in prison, or bring ruin upon their parents, disaster upon their wives and children. Their kinsfolk and neighbors all wish them dead, yet their sins remain unexpiated, flowing into their descendants—some become the offspring of beggars, others the children of thieves and bandits, leaving great stains upon later generations.

Perfected One, the transgressions I have described—would they not die with sins still unpaid?

Hearing the Master’s words, my heart trembles with alarm and aches with sorrow. I fear I may not recover.

If the Perfected One feels such pain, you may yet live. But if you do not awaken fully, your death will come soon. Be vigilant—my words must not be violated. Those who violate them will perish, not by my hand, but by their own deeds. Do you understand?

Indeed.

I have expounded these six matters for you, yet have scarcely conveyed one ten-thousandth of their full import. You who have attained my Dao should ponder deeply and plan far ahead—do not turn back to careless self-indulgence, nor fail to extend kindness in your deeds. Strive to learn, and when you contemplate doing good or evil, remember that reversal will only lower your standing. Each must weigh their own fate: within these teachings lie six deadly sins, and six great virtues, both of which shape the self. Those who do good will surely receive good in return, while those who take evil lightly will daily bear sons of misfortune.

Self-reflection and self-assessment bring no joy greater than self-mastery. Be cautious, ponder deeply, dwell upon these truths, and the heart of the wise and enlightened will surely open. The Way, virtue, benevolence, and goodness are entrusted to those of moral character, while misfortune and wickedness fall to those who fail to reflect deeply.

This principle and method, if all could emulate the words of my text to correct themselves, would leave no evil persons in the world. This is the primordial Dao of the Highest Antiquity from the celestial realms, capable of transforming people. Once they come to know it, all will turn to goodness and never revert to evil.

The superior person delights in life and may study the true Dao. The greatly virtuous may cultivate its power, the generous may cultivate its benevolence, the wise may cultivate its wisdom, the capable may cultivate its skill, and the strong may cultivate its strength. If one can fully apply these teachings, reflecting upon them thoroughly, they will distance themselves from misfortune and evil.

Heaven and Earth will cherish them, the six directions will nurture them, and even emperors will have no further concerns—governing will become effortless, and they will wander in lasting peace. Do you, Perfected One, understand this?

"It brings the greatest joy! I am overjoyed."

"You may indeed be called one who delights in goodness and understands it. Thus, the sages and worthies of old never ceased their teachings, for they witnessed the clarity of Heaven’s prohibitions and each sought to secure their own fate. Therefore, the teachings of sages and worthies fill the world—have you alone not perceived this?"

"Excellent! Excellent indeed!"

Thus, the sages, worthies, and superior persons of antiquity all studied diligently, learning day and night without cease, for they too saw the clarity of Heaven and Earth’s commands. They dared not take their actions lightly nor grow complacent in their studies. Thus, they attained lasting fortune and no harm befell them. These worthies and extraordinary individuals were not inherently wise—they achieved this through diligent study. As for the wicked people among them, all arose from their failure to study diligently, from their self-neglect and carelessness.

My Dao is the gateway to fortune and misfortune—do you not yet understand this?

"Indeed, indeed. Yet you have spoken of all, from the highest to the lowest—what does this mean?"

Alas! How is it that you still do not perceive?

""

Seeing the Heavenly Master speak at length, I am now even more bewildered and know not myself—what is awakening, and what is not awakening?

"Now I shall make you understand through practice.

Before the Perfected One: the governance of Heaven transforms people toward goodness."

From the highest to the lowest, how many methods of governance are there?

"There are ten thousand methods, each with distinct intent.
Yet even the Perfected One upholds rectitude thus—how much harder for the common people to awaken, long lost in delusion as they are."

I have erred, only the Heavenly Master can enlighten me.

"Indeed. In assisting the Emperor and kings in governance, there are in essence ten methods:
First, governance by primordial *qi*;
second, governance by spontaneity;
third, governance by the Dao;
fourth, governance by virtue;
fifth, governance by benevolence;
sixth, governance by righteousness;
seventh, governance by ritual;
eighth, governance by culture;
ninth, governance by law;
tenth, governance by military force.
These ten mark the end—why is this?
All things begin with primordial *qi* and conclude with the military, for the military severs and strikes, thus it is the lowest.
Therefore, things arise from the Great Mystery, flourish in the Great Yang, and perish in the White Tiger.
Thus, primordial *qi* resides in the North, while the White Tiger dwells in the West—this is what is meant.
Heaven employs governance by primordial *qi*, sending forth the winds to nurture all things.
Earth employs governance by spontaneity, so that following goodness yields goodness, and following evil yields evil.
Humans, in turn, follow the harmony of Heaven and Earth, governing by the Dao, and thus preside over the active Dao.
All affairs flow and circulate—these three methods correspond to the omens of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.
Beyond these three, virtue and benevolence serve as mere ornamentation; below benevolence, much harm arises, making governance difficult.
Thus, my Dao is ever joyous, fundamentally aligning with Heaven’s nature of restraint, and discarding the nature of premature decay.
The fundamental principle of all living things is constant order: they take form in the middle and descend into chaos at the end. Once lost to chaos, order cannot be restored—thus one must begin with the highest.
Therefore, Heaven eternally guards its root, Earth guards its center, and with one revolution, humanity guards its lower nature. With three revolutions, the Dao is thus disordered.
Perfected One, have you now understood this?"

"Yes, yes."

"Master, I now have doubts."
"When following a teacher, one may speak freely—do not hesitate to voice your doubts."
"Perfected One, when Heaven aids the emperor and kings, by what is this made manifest? When it benefits ministers and the people, what is the proof?"
"Only the Celestial Master—now I fall short in understanding. My words often miss the mark, and I incur many faults, so I dare not speak further."
"Ah, proceed."
"Yes, yes.
When Heaven aids the emperor and kings, it bestows upon them wondrous scriptures, which can be used to govern, their efficacy surpassing all bounds, aligning with yin and yang. This benefits lesser ministers.
It grants them worthy officials to benefit the people, enabling them to bear virtuous children."
"Perfected One, your words are sound—could there be further marvels?
This is the utmost.
When Heaven desires to elevate a virtuous ruler, it causes the birth of divine sages, who transmit the discourse of Heaven and Earth and comprehend their intent.
Thus, Perfected One, you have come to study this—it should be entrusted to the most prudent and virtuous of the people, awakening their hearts and guiding their thoughts.
It should be presented to rulers of great virtue, to be shown to all worthies, so that together they may grasp its meaning and convey it to the common folk.
When the people receive it, fifteen will follow one another, discussing and governing, rectifying all that is unjust—not for the sake of Heaven, Earth, or the ruler alone.
Yet the root of all faults lies in humanity’s leaders. If leaders themselves bear grave transgressions, they invoke the wrath of the August Heaven and Earth, and all stems from a single person.
There are those who first learn the true Dao but do not strive to transform and teach others.
Great fortune befalls those who first know virtue, yet they do not exert themselves to transform others.
Households with accumulated wealth refuse to practice benevolence through generous giving.
People born with the capacity to learn do not strive to study, nor seek the true Dao to attain longevity.
Those capable of learning virtue to transform themselves do not exert themselves to study virtue and refine their nature.
Those with strength do not labor diligently to improve their lot, instead inviting hardship and poverty.
These are the six great transgressions, long accumulated by Heaven and humanity.
Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, each generation has borne the burdens of the last, and later generations grow ever more grievous. When many gather, great harm arises.
This causes Heaven and Earth to lose their proper order, and emperors to endure prolonged sorrow in their governance, leaving past and present in disorder. Heaven deeply abhors this.
Thus, I hasten to transmit the words of Heaven. From the most ancient times to the present, Heaven and Earth have suffered afflictions, stifled and obstructed. Ordinary people cannot know this—only divine sages transmit these teachings. It is not I alone; Perfected One, do not find this strange.
Now that I am about to depart this world, I may no longer appear freely among the people. Thus, I transmit this text to you, Perfected One. Once you receive it, you too will depart the mundane world and may no longer serve as a teacher among the people.
Therefore, I charge you to seek out the most virtuous and discerning of the people and entrust it to them. Now, hasten to deliver it to a ruler of virtue. Dare not delay or obstruct its passage—how weighty is this task!
Today, Heaven seeks to alleviate suffering and bring peace to the emperor and kings. Let the enlightened ruler display this to all worthies, to transform the people. Let each reflect on their faults, to dissolve the inherited burdens of their ancestors, so that all may act for their own sake and not grow negligent. Then Heaven will rejoice greatly, and governance will achieve peace.
If you harbor doubts, suspecting my words lack utmost sincerity, know that this text is but a trial of truth.
Why is this so? Ancient texts number in the millions, yet governance has never attained great peace.
If the wise and enlightened remain skeptical, dismissing these writings as false, how can one know their power?
A warrior untested—how can his strength be known? A text unseen in practice—how can its divinity be discerned?
I have received the words of Heaven to test you, Perfected One. From now on, when you receive any text, put it to the test at once. Do not idly fabricate falsehoods.
Heaven deeply abhors this; Earth suffers greatly, deeming it a grave affliction, a true grievance of resentment.
This causes the flourishing of all things to falter, bringing many disasters and premature deaths, preventing them from fulfilling their natural lifespans.
Emperors grow despondent, officials and people descend into chaos, no longer governing one another. The great calamity lies here—these are the six transgressions.
Those who possess the Dao envy it and do not strive to teach the foolish.
Those who possess virtue envy it and do not strive to transform the foolish.
Those who hoard wealth envy it and do not practice generosity, though Heaven births all people to give.
Those with knowledge do not strive to study the true Dao to enlighten themselves, instead mocking those who teach.
Those with ability do not strive to study and teach, instead reviling them.
Those with strength do not labor diligently to cultivate wealth and benevolence, instead growing idle and lazy.
When parents teach them, they reject their instruction.
Thus, I command you, Perfected One, to swiftly present this text, so that all worthies may deeply reflect on the people and contemplate their great faults. Perfected One, do you now understand this instruction?"
"Yes, yes.
Since the divine person has expounded the laws of Heaven, why merely entrust it to individuals? Should it not be disseminated among the people, beginning with those above and below?"
"Excellent! Excellent!
Today, the qi of great peace from the highest reaches of Heaven is about to arrive. All matters must follow its order—thus, it begins with those above and below.
Without this order, it becomes rebellious qi, causing governance to falter. Most failures stem from rebellious qi, from disobedience.
Perfected One, do you wish to add to this?"
"I dare not.
Thus, it must begin with those above and below. Do not ask further."
"Yes, yes.
Go forth and act with care, each considering your own conduct.
These six great transgressions are sternly judged by the Dao of Heaven. Do not act recklessly—Heaven, dwelling above, watches over humanity."
"Yes, yes.
I humbly ask one more question: when a person has obtained the essential Dao and essential virtue, where should they place them?"
"They should present them to their ruler."
"Why must they be presented to the ruler?"
"The essential Dao is that by which the ruler is pacified. When applied in governance, it wins the favor of Heaven."

"The essential virtue is that by which the ruler is nourished. When applied in governance, it wins the favor of Earth.

Truly knowing this yet refusing to present it to those above is disrespectful—such transgressions cannot be absolved."

"Why is this so severe?"

"Observing your manner of speech, one would think you know nothing at all. As a son, this is disobedience; as a subject, this is disloyalty and faithlessness—such offenses defy description.

Perfected One, why do you ask which is the graver? Why has your learning not deepened with each passing day, but instead grown more shallow?"

"Your foolish disciple truly does not see it."

"You claim not to see, yet even the common people conceal and hoard their essential Dao and virtue, causing their ruler distress and suffering in ignorance. The fault lies in the obstruction of true Dao and virtue, leaving them uncommunicated.

Moreover, the essential Dao is that by which Heaven is honored; the essential virtue is that by which Earth is honored. Fools sever these connections—Heaven abhors them, Earth detests them, and their transgressions cannot be absolved.

Perfected One, you alone have been favored by Heaven with longevity, yet your learning remains incomplete, even transgressing Heaven’s prohibitions. Those who serve must take heed."

"Yes, yes."

**"The Scripture of Heaven’s Teachings on Harmony for Humanity’s Perpetual Auspiciousness and Distant Misfortune"**
*Collated and Harmonized Great Peace Scripture, Scroll Sixty-Eight, Ding Section Seventeen*
*Great Peace Scripture, Scroll Sixty-Eight*
*"Admonition to the Six Disciples" (One Hundred and Fourth Discourse)*

**〈Opening〉**
As my departure draws near, I leave you, the Six Disciples, with a single admonition.

The Dao is all-pervading—without above or below, without exterior or interior. Guard its harmonious qi, and it is called the numinous.
Seek it near, and you shall greatly attain; seek it afar, and you shall lose it.
Thus, the ancient sagely kings who governed well began within the belly, truly employing the Dao, and governance came of itself.
Move without transgressing its measures and standards, and the myriad things order themselves. It lies near in the heart-mind, yet scatters to fill the Four Seas.
The ancients called this the Essential Dao.

**〈Closing〉**
Govern with joy and desire for non-action; take heed not to lose this, for it is the plumb line that corrects the worthy.
Now I exhort you again to make this clear.
You six have questioned me about my writings day after day. Though the Dao branches into different tendencies, it shares a single matter.
Yet the tongue, able to traverse the Six Directions, completes the kingly Dao, explaining the myriad things, each with its distinct meaning.
Heaven and Earth attain great peace; the lord-king attains non-action.
My writings know the numinous heart, penetrating the Six Directions and Eight Corners. From on high they descend and submit, all harboring good hearts, without evil intent.
Their essential knot resides near, dwelling within—like the myriad things, the heart lies within, while branches dwell without.
When the inner flourishes, the outer flourishes; when the inner declines, the outer declines.
Thus, the ancient August Dao Emperors and sagely kings, desiring to rectify the all-penetrating Six Distant Directions and Eight Corners, first rectified the inner.
By rectifying the inner to order the outer, ten thousand upon ten thousand respond, a hundred million upon a hundred million do not fail.
But by ordering the outer to rectify the inner, ten thousand are lost.

**〈Opening〉**
Therefore, the great sages of old taught people to ponder deeply and contemplate afar, closing their nine apertures, resting their four limbs, rendering themselves undifferentiated—like a ring without end, or an embryo in the womb without duties—only then could they attain its principle.
My Dao takes this as its great essential.

**〈Closing〉**
Thus, it returns to making each guard its root.
When Heaven generates humanity, it endows each with the true Dao, complete in all things.
If a teacher opens, guides, and instructs them, they may be made to know all; but if the gates and doors remain unopened, though they receive Heaven’s true Dao, they shall know nothing.
It is like a newborn infant placed in a chamber—without guidance or instruction in affairs, nothing can be known.
The difference among people lies only in the varying customs of the Eight Directions, hence their knowledge and learning differ.
If one person studies, circulating within and without, all can be known.
As I shall soon depart for distant parts, there may yet be those to whom I can transmit, and I cannot always remain seated, guarding all my disciples.
You six must carefully read my writings. From beginning to end, they form a knot. If you do not understand my intent, examine the ancient texts to clarify it.
Those who practice the Upper Dao are known by the Mysterious Perfected; those who practice the Lower Dao, by the Compliant Perfected; those of the East, by the Initial Perfected; those of the South, by the Grand Perfected; those of the West, by the Lesser Perfected; those of the North, by the Obscure Perfected.
The Dao is largely the same with minor differences, thus it can distinguish yin and yang without limit, transforming into one myriad, one thousand, five hundred, and twenty characters.
Though the harmony of the myriad things is slightly complete, it has yet to exhaust the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, utterly penetrating without exterior or interior.
Therefore, examine its absence, grasp its warp, perceive its beginning, and it may be modeled and recorded.
Record the ancient and the present—its essentials, though disordered, align with what the divine and sagely have recorded, like overlapping compasses and matching squares. Though separated by a hundred million myriad years, it is as if speaking face to face.
Thus, it may serve as the constant scripture of Heaven and Earth, as the numinous Dao of yin and yang. Do not wonder at the repetition in my writings before and after.
The reason for repetition is fear of loss.
Moreover, the Dao of Heaven is most stern. Having spoken, one dare not omit anything. To communicate incompletely is called a "trifling Dao," a grave transgression.
I truly pity this, hence the repetition.
It is like the sages of the high, middle, and low antiquity, born in different ages, whose words follow one another, repeating and expounding, further examining and clarifying—only then can the Dao of Heaven be fully known. This is the meaning.
Go forth! I have urgent matters. Take great care to hold Heaven’s treasure and transmit it to the proper person.

Here the Master admonishes his six disciples.
*Tai Ping Jing* Collated and Combined, Scroll Sixty-Nine, Wu Section, Part One.
*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Sixty-Nine.
"Celestial Prognostications: The Method of Stem-Branch Correspondences," One Hundred and Fifth.

The Perfected One bowed twice and said:
"Though born lowly, I have been treated by the Heavenly Master as a newborn child, with kindness and affection so profound that I am granted audience even in haste, morning and evening. The works of Heaven are vast beyond gratitude. Now I venture once more to inquire about its most recondite mysteries—the arcana of Heaven—yet dare not speak abruptly."

"Speak plainly. Since you are charged with questioning Heaven’s affairs, you must pursue them to the end. You may not abandon them halfway."

"As you say. This humble one has observed that the Heavenly Master’s teachings are boundless. Thus, we disciples, awakened by Heaven, fear that should we one day part from our Master, there would be none to whom we might address our doubts. Therefore, we venture—bold and unrelenting—to ask about the prognostications that can perpetually secure the state and bring peace to the realm, so that the lord of men may govern with folded arms, free from care. He would then ever play the zither and lute, delighting in music and leisure, as stable as Heaven and Earth, never again facing peril. Might we hear of this?"

"Indeed. Do you Perfected Ones seek true progress? Profound and subtle is your question—you seek the esoteric charts and prognostic texts that penetrate Heaven and Earth, a single word of which cannot be altered for ten thousand generations. Does the Lord of Heaven, grieved by manifold disasters and sorrows, now send you Perfected Ones to resolve these doubts?"

"Just so."

"Then I shall fully expound for you the great essentials of Heaven’s compass and square, its secret texts and decisive instructions, that they may be... [lacuna] The Perfected Ones shall follow and record them themselves."

"As you say."

"Now, the August Heaven takes the four seasons as its branches, while the fertile Earth takes the Five Phases as its body. The branches govern decline and flourishing; the body governs the compass and square. These nine spirits pervade the world, penetrating above and below to their utmost limits, their transformations difficult to perceive. They are the double treasure of Heaven and Earth, the gateway of all spirits. They possess an inherent constancy; one may not recklessly transgress them. Those who follow them enjoy enduring fortune; those who disrupt them remain forever at odds with Heaven and Earth."

"Would that I might hear its meaning—can it truly be perceived?"
"Excellent, words of the Perfected Ones! Now I shall expound it fully for you. Only compose yourselves, sit in stillness, and ponder my words."
"Yes, yes."

"Now, the celestial prognostication models take the south as the ruler’s domain. Thus the sun in the south is the ruler; fire in the south is the ruler; the Great Yang in the south is the ruler; the four seasons and the height of summer in the south are the ruler; the Five Domestic Sacrifices and the stove in the south are the ruler; the Five Viscera and the heart in the south are the ruler. The ruler, by model, should wear red, for this is the phase of fire. Therefore, when the ruler encounters anomalies, they invariably correspond to the Yang—never to the phases of others. The Yang is the sun at its brightest, chief among all lights, so celestial prognostication always uses the sun to divine the ruler’s flourishing or decline. Do you Perfected Ones understand?"
"Yes, yes, we now understand."

"The model for the ruler of men is ever to seek kinship with the benevolent and to govern with those who possess a heart. Those with whom one may share governance must ever practice the Dao and cherish life. Even the young and weak, or those ministers and worthy men who are still maturing, the ruler should nurture, not harm. Thus the east cherishes life, while the south cherishes nurturance. Those who are unbenevolent in their intentions cannot long share affairs, and those who are unenlightened cannot serve as rulers. Thus the east is wood, benevolent and possessed of a heart, while the south is fire, luminous.

The celestial model holds that those who govern as emperors and kings must ever act through the Dao and virtue. Thus the east is the Dao, and the Dao governs life; the south is virtue, and virtue governs nurturance—hence the south governs nurturance. Those who govern must emulate Heaven by civilizing through culture. Thus the east is culture, borne by the dragon’s appearance. The south is refinement, and thus rectitude becomes the pattern of culture.

Refinement is great luminosity, so culture arises in the east and is illuminated in the south. Thus celestial culture is red, and red is fire. Benevolence and rulership move upward, and the sun should stand high and bright, serving as a model for people. Thus when wood and fire move, they invariably ascend—this is the image of the ruler. Therefore, dwelling in the east, one relies on benevolence to ascend, and those who govern must thus reside in the south.

Thus the east is Lesser Yang, the ruler’s beginning of life, and so the sun rises in the east. The south is Greater Yang, the ruler’s height of brilliance. Lesser Yang is the ruler’s family and parents, while Greater Yang is the ruler’s person and position. Lesser Yang is the ruler’s family, wood is fire’s parents, and the ruler takes Lesser Yang as family, so fire is called wood’s child. Do you Perfected Ones understand?"

"Yes, yes."
"You have understood it well.

Lesser Yin is the minister, and ministers bend and submit in righteousness, yielding to Greater Yang. Thus metal follows fire in bending and submission. Among people, what is desirable is that ministers always submit in righteousness to assist their ruler—this is what is desirable. Therefore, Lesser Yin is called the minister.

Do you Perfected Ones understand?"
"Yes, yes."

"Greater Yin is the people, and the people move without ceasing. Thus water flows without knowing rest. The people are charged with managing livelihoods for the state, kings, and lords. Therefore, water should follow in nurturing and sustaining wood. The east is the ruler’s family.

Do you Perfected Ones understand?"
"Yes, yes."
"You have understood it well.

Now, the celestial portents: Lesser Yang fears Lesser Yin. Thus ministers may seize control of the state, kings, lords, and officials. Greater Yang fears Greater Yin; therefore, when a state possesses the Dao and virtue, and its ruler and ministers are worthy and enlightened, the people follow. When a state lacks the Dao and virtue, the people rebel. Thus the great essentials of governing a state lie in abundance of people as wealth, and scarcity of people as great poverty.

Do all you Perfected Ones comprehend this?"
"Yes, yes."

"Well then, you have awakened to this."

"The celestial patterns and laws divide into six parts. The southeast and above belong to Heaven, thus all things in generation ascend, and the crawling people all emerge and dwell without, belonging to Heaven. Therefore, Heaven’s color is outwardly azure, resembling wood, and inwardly red, resembling fire. Do you Perfected Ones understand this?"
"Yes, yes."
"Well then, you have comprehended it."

"The celestial and terrestrial portents: the west and the north belong below to Earth. Thus, when all things reach autumn and winter, they all fall and return to the soil. When the crawling people reach autumn and winter, they all enter caves to dwell. Therefore, Earth’s color is outwardly yellow and white, resembling soil and metal, and inwardly contains water and is black, resembling the northward movement. Do you Perfected Ones understand this?"
"Yes, yes."

"The celestial portents: the east and the south are noble in position, belonging above to Heaven, governing as rulers, sovereigns, teachers, and fathers. The west and the north are base in position, belonging to Earth, serving as ministers, the inner palace, and the people. Thus, *ji* (己) is the inner palace of *jia* (甲). *Jia* is Heaven, the fundamental position of the king, thus *jia* is the Heart Star. The Heart Star is fire, representing the king. Therefore, the east is also the precursor of the king. The Heart Star is fire, and its movement belongs to the south. Do you Perfected Ones understand this, as the sun rises in the east yet its position is in the south?"
"Yes, yes."

"Excellent, you have understood this."

"The celestial portents: *bing* (丙) is the chief of fire, the most radiant of all, the position of the ruler. *Xin* (辛) belongs to *bing*, for *xin* is the inner palace of *bing*. Do you Perfected Ones understand this?"
"Yes, yes."
"Excellent, you have understood this."

"Now, *ji* (己) is also the empress, and *xin* (辛) is also the empress—what does this mean?"
"Excellent is your inquiry, for you have grasped the meaning of the celestial portents. Now, *ji* is paired with *jia* (甲), and *jia* is the father of *bing* (丙). Thus, *ji* is the palace of the Grand Empress. *Xin* is paired with *bing*, and *bing* is the son of *jia*. Thus, *xin* is the palace of the Lesser Empress. *Bing* is the rightful son of *jia*, the ruler who receives the mandate. Do you Perfected Ones understand this?"
"Yes, yes."
"Excellent, you Perfected Ones have understood this."

"*Geng* (庚) belongs to *yi* (乙), representing the feudal lords and kings of the state. *Ren* (壬) belongs to *ding* (丁), representing the sisters of the emperor. *Gui* (癸) belongs to *wu* (戊), representing the family of the state’s Grand Empress."

"Now that the ten Celestial Stems have been explained, each with its proper affiliation, we wish to hear how the twelve Earthly Branches correspond to them."
"Excellent question! The Dao of Heaven operates thus: though yin and yang move in their courses, the affairs they govern each have their own fixed domains. The Dao of Heaven is uniform, yet it does not compel all domains to follow in unison.

*Jia* (甲) takes *yin* (寅) as its domain; *yi* (乙) takes *mao* (卯) as its domain; *bing* (丙) takes *wu* (午) as its domain; *ding* (丁) takes *si* (巳) as its domain; *wu* (戊) takes *chen* (辰) and *xu* (戌) as its domain; *ji* (己) takes *chou* (丑) and *wei* (未) as its domain; *geng* (庚) takes *shen* (申) as its domain; *xin* (辛) takes *you* (酉) as its domain; *ren* (壬) takes *zi* (子) as its domain; *gui* (癸) takes *hai* (亥) as its domain.

Thus, the Way of Heaven moves in reversal to govern; the Way of Earth is stillness. Therefore, there is division of land but no division of people—there are states with territory but no states as such. Thus, Heaven and Earth do not shift: Heaven completes one revolution in a day and night, moving in this as its constant. Therefore, the twelve Earthly Branches each reside in their place and do not follow the ten Celestial Stems in their movement. Do you Perfected Ones understand this?"
"Yes, yes."

The Dao of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons and five phases, operate through mutual fulfillment, revolving yet differing in their manifestations. They cycle through darkness and obscurity without end, known only to the great divine sages of antiquity. To exhaustively explain this to you would strain resources and prove overly elaborate, only deepening confusion—leaving rulers of the earthly virtue bewildered and uncertain of the path to follow. Thus, I have refrained.

Yet it is not that I惜 to expound for you, but rather that the explanation knows no bounds. Do you, Perfected Ones, understand this?"
"Yes, yes."

"Go forth, for you have gained some insight. The Virtuous Lord governs by my celestial omens, and in ten thousand matters, not one shall err. Thus, the Dao of Heaven indeed has its fixed boundaries: the east and south serve as emblems of the sovereign, belonging to Heaven—hence the title 'Son of Heaven.' The west and north represent the rear palace and the people and ministers, belonging to Earth—hence Earth is called the rear palace. Do you, Perfected Ones, understand this?"
"Yes, yes."

"The celestial omens decree that the east fears the west. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, when rulers have followed military strategy, fostering the qi of metal, the martial aspect leaves the sovereign’s emblem devoid of vitality. Fire then greatly declines, and governance becomes inauspicious and chaotic. If you, Perfected Ones, wish to truly know the certainty of celestial omens, observe from high antiquity through middle antiquity to recent times: when rulers abandoned the Dao and virtue, favoring the qi of metal and military strategy, their governance was entirely inauspicious, plagued by bandits and misfortune.

Thus, the sages of high antiquity deeply understood Heaven’s fixed patterns and symbols, and dared not govern by arms or martial force. If emperors and kings desire lasting peace and good fortune, they should heed these celestial omens: swiftly restrain and abolish metal, weapons, and military preparations, and urgently promote the Dao and supreme virtue, aligning with Heaven’s law to accord with the will of August Heaven. Thereby, they will suppress and eradicate all treacherous and inauspicious elements, and the response shall be immediate and unmistakable. Do you, Perfected Ones, understand this?"
"Yes, yes."

The celestial omen-patterns and models decree: though the Great Yang is the ruler, it deeply fears the Great Yin—the movement of water. The sweetest and finest of waters is wine. Wine arises as the king of waters, its elder, the finest of all beverages, its qi belonging to the Kan position, presiding over theft and bandits by night. Thus, from its name, wine is called "indulgence," for it is the king and elder of waters, and when water reigns, the Great Yang wanes.

Do you, Perfected Ones, desire to know the truth of these celestial omens? From the highest antiquity down to the middle ages, rulers who indulged in wine could not achieve great peace; their governance instead fell into chaos, their offices rife with strife, and bandits arose—this is clear proof. Therefore, when a virtuous ruler of great peace governs, the essence of fire should shine brightly; one must not follow the Great Yin, allowing the power of water to reign and thereby suppress and harm the governance. Thus, wine must be prohibited.

[Appendix] Wine is the king of waters. When water reigns, it ought to overcome fire. Fire is the ruler’s virtue; one must urgently prohibit wine to preserve the power of fire.

"I wish to hear: what is to be prohibited, and which wines are to be cut off?"
"Only market wine is to be prohibited."
"Now, Heavenly Master, what have you observed to uniquely prohibit market wine?"
"Indeed, the market corresponds to the movement of water. Thus, the people and goods of the four directions all gather there. The rivers and seas, too, are the kings and elders of waters, and so all streams and wealth likewise flow and gather there. Water is the movement of the Dark Warrior of the north, and thus it is greedy, frequently seizing others’ wealth. The market, too, is where the five directions converge to trade and profit, giving rise to bandits, rogues, and deceitful elements—all under the dominion of Kan, ruled by water.

Heaven’s law operates by resonance through kindred categories, and so the market is the movement of water. If wine is indulged and distributed in great measure, it is again called the reign of water. Market-dwellers, too, rejoice in wine and call it king, creating a double reign of water. The fault is sixfold: it suppresses the fire-qi of the Great Yang, causing the ruler’s governance to weaken and treacherous ministers to arise. Do you, Perfected Ones, understand this?"
"Having heard the Heavenly Master’s explanation, we are dazzled and confused. We wish to hear the great essentials."
"Excellent is your question. Now, all you Perfected Ones have come from afar to inquire of Heaven’s affairs, seeking to resolve the harms of karmic inheritance for virtuous rulers and emperors. I shall not withhold anything. Be seated in peace, and I shall distinguish and explain everything for you, clarifying the essential meaning."
"Yes, yes."

"The celestial prognostication’s decree: when metal and jade prevail in governance, if the military departments flourish excessively, the wood-qi’s primordial vitality is severed, and earth gains sovereignty. When earth is greatly exalted, it becomes the palace of the Grand Empress. Its qi belongs to the northwest, and when the Great Yin attains great sovereignty, treacherous ministers arise, the rear palace intrigues, and the path is lost in tumultuous ascent. When earth rules, metal serves as its minister, and together they rise in tumult. The qi of *si* and *xin* both gain sovereignty, surging forth in great ascendancy. According to heaven’s regulatory law, this breeds many treacheries in the rear palace—yet this is not the fault of the rear palace itself, but rather what is called a failure in governance to align with celestial prognostication, a loss of the great celestial divisions. Thus, disasters return and overturn one another. This has been so since the opening of heaven and earth; the transmission of celestial timing and fortune has not yet been fully distinguished and explained. Now, emperors and kings lose the celestial method of governance, giving rise to these calamitous transformations. Do you, Perfected Ones, deeply understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"The celestial prognostication: to indulge in wine is of the water class. The marketplace is the domain of water, the great gathering place of the kingly and the common. To indulge in wine in the marketplace is called the great sovereignty of water and wine. When water rules, fire’s qi diminishes; when fire’s qi diminishes, it transforms into ashes; when it transforms into ashes, it changes into earth, and thus fire’s qi is entrusted to earth. When earth gains sovereignty and rises from the ground, it aligns with metal and water in the northwest. The Great Yin pertains to the people, and ministers gain sovereignty in turn. Treacherous ministers arise again, the *si*-qi once more takes action, the rear palace transgresses, and turmoil stirs anew. The resulting disasters bring theft and banditry without respite. All this lies in the indulgence of water, which injures the yang-virtue. Now, the reason I distinguish and explain this for you, Perfected Ones, is that I see your earnest inquiry, your deep concern, and your desire to assist the virtuous ruler in accord with the will of August Heaven. Thus, I clearly expound for you the great divisions of heaven and earth’s governance, that which you must emulate. Do not transgress again, for transgression will bring only confusion and chaos. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Permit me to ask one doubt."
"Speak."

"Now, the capital gathers a multitude of people and wealth at its center—does the capital then correspond to the water phase?"
"Ah! Perfected Ones in learning—how can you be so clear at one moment and so benighted at another? You fall short. Yet how could one ever fully grasp it all? Nevertheless, the capital corresponds to the center of earth, the place where fire may securely rest. It is not like a marketplace, merely a place to amass wealth. The capital ought to gather together the Dao and virtue, benevolence and worthies, to govern the world in concert. Why would you say the lord of the capital should merely amass wealth? How profoundly foolish! If you doubt my words, let me explain for you.

From ancient times to the present, wherever the capital has gathered those of Dao and virtue, worthies and the wise, the world has been entirely at peace under its governance. But where only treasures and wealth are amassed without worthy and enlightened ones, all falls into chaos. In your view, Perfected One, should the capital be like a marketplace, merely a place to gather wealth? Do you understand?"
"Yes, yes."

"Now, for the various Perfected Ones, I shall further elucidate the celestial prognostic patterns and cosmic principles.

The sun arises from Lesser Yang and flourishes in Greater Yang; the moon arises from Lesser Yin and flourishes in Greater Yin. The sun is the essence of Heaven and the radiance of Yang, thus it is called the sovereign, its position in the south. The moon is the essence of Earth and the radiance of Yin, thus the moon is the minister, its position in the north. The south is for day, the north for night. Therefore, when the sun reigns and governs, the moon and night wane and diminish; when the moon reigns and governs, the sun and day wane and diminish. Thus, when the qi of the north prevails, the qi of the south declines; when the qi of the south prevails, the qi of the north declines. Hence, one must urgently cease the reign of wine, to sever the decline of water and metal.

Do the Perfected Ones clearly understand this?"
"Yes, yes."

"The cosmic principles are thus divided: Yang is Heaven, male, sovereign, father, elder, and teacher; Yin is Earth, female, minister, child, the people, and mother. Therefore, the southeast is Yang, and the northwest is Yin. If the Perfected Ones wish to know the truth of celestial prognostication, from the very opening of Heaven and Earth, whenever rulers have indulged in military might, allowed sovereigns to indulge in wine, or followed the governance of women—greatly heeding their words—such rulers, being of Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, and Earth, belong to the northwest. From such commands, all have later fallen into chaos and met with calamity.

Perceive this with benevolence."

"The virtuous, the wise, and the sagely all belong to the southeast, to Yang, to Heaven. Those who follow such words later all attain good governance."

"I wish to hear why the worthy and the sagely belong to the southeast."

"The essence of fire is the heart, and the heart is sagely; the essence of wood is benevolence, thus its symbol resides in the east. The southeast nurtures and fosters all things, and the worthy and the sagely, being gentle and luminous, likewise nurture all things without harming them. Therefore, the nature of the sagely and the worthy is gentle and luminous, all benevolent and bright. Benevolence resembles wood, brightness resembles fire, thus they all reside in the southeast."

"Excellent! Excellent! Having heard the Celestial Master’s words, I am greatly enlightened."

"Moreover, in the celestial prognostication and cosmic patterns, the southeast is where the handle of the Northern Dipper points, and in reckoning the four seasons, it is where kings receive the Mandate. The northwest belongs to Earth and is the Dipper’s bowl, where those bound to it meet with qi of death and extinction. Thus, when Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, and Earth allow one to reign, overcoming Yang, this is called ‘reversing Heaven and Earth,’ and so often leads to chaos. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"Several foolish students, moved by the Celestial Master’s compassion, have been taught the celestial prognostication formulas. I wish to ask one matter with a single word: now the south is Yang, yet it may reverse to yield *Xun*, *Li*, and *Kun*; the north is Yin, yet it may reverse to yield *Qian*, *Kan*, and *Gen*."

"Excellent! Your question is profound. You perceive the subtle intent of Heaven. Now, the *Yi* (Changes) is rooted in the subtle qi of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang, taking the primordial qi as its beginning. Thus, the south, being utmost Yang, generates Yin, and so records its Yin; the north, being utmost Yin, generates Yang, and so records its Yang. These subtle qi have not yet the power to govern affairs. Therefore, in the *Yi*, the first *Nine* of *Zi* is the ‘hidden dragon—do not act,’ for it cannot yet govern affairs, and so one does not act. This is merely the inception of primordial qi."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Go on, Perfected One, you have understood. Now, what I record in the celestial prognostication are the great divisions of Heaven, those that govern the qi of celestial governance and serve as the guiding principles for the world. Do the Perfected Ones understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Now, what I have spoken is precisely what the rulers of the world should follow as the method of governance. What you asked concerns the inception of the correct qi. If the Perfected Ones still harbor doubts upon hearing my words, I shall explain in full the eight boundaries of Heaven and Earth."

"Yes, yes."

"The boundary of the sun is determined by its rising in *Mao* and setting in *You*, with the south as Yang and the north as Yin. The boundary of the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Door is determined by *Xun* arising in the southeast corner and *Qian* arising in the northwest corner, with the northeast as Yang and the southwest as Yin. The first *Nine* of *Zi* and the first *Six* of *Wu* take the east as Yang and the west as Yin. *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) is established in the northeast corner, and *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn) in the northwest corner, with the southeast as Yang and the northwest as Yin. These are called the eight boundaries of Heaven and Earth, which distinguish the positions of Yin and Yang. Do the Perfected Ones now understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go on, you have understood."

Thus, the Great Canon takes the southeast as Heaven and the northwest as Earth, with Earth yielding in compliance. If a king subdues his Heaven, it is called "Heaven and Earth reversed," hence inauspicious. When Heaven fulfills its affairs and the king subdues his Earth, each attains its proper place—hence auspicious. Perfected One, receive this text and ponder it deeply. Entrust it to a ruler of superior virtue, and if he enacts my teachings, he shall differ not from the gods, and Heaven shall aid him beyond due season.

Go now, for I have expounded to you the minor completion of celestial portents and proofs. I would further reveal to you, Perfected One, the vast expanse of Heaven above and Earth below, the farthest reaches of the eight poles, and the array of stellar lodges—all to be explained in part. Yet should I expound the subtle wonders of the celestial Dao in full, some might grow dizzy, losing their way, and the true Dao would thereafter fall into disuse, leaving no means to resolve ancient calamities, thus plunging the exalted into sorrow. Therefore, I have spoken to you only of the Great Canon’s most accessible truths, that you may awaken and no more. I do not speak of the profound and abstruse—not out of reluctance, but for good cause.

"Yes, yes. I humbly request to inquire further on one decisive matter."

"Now, the Celestial Master shall explain to this unenlightened student the ten Celestial Stems of Heaven, each with its corresponding pair, and the twelve Earthly Branches of the Earthly Dao, likewise possessing yin and yang, odd and even—why then does only Heaven attain such pairing?"

"Excellent! Your question truly grasps the essentials of the Dao. Yet Earth, though purely yin and dwelling alone, inherently possesses its own yin and yang. The laws of Heaven and Earth correspond above and below: Heaven has *zi*, Earth also has *zi*; Heaven has *wu*, Earth also has *wu*; Heaven has *kan*, Earth also has *kan*; Heaven has *li*, Earth also has *li*—their correspondence is thus.

Therefore, *chou* and *wei* are the rear palaces of *yin*. *Shen* belongs to *mao*, the son-in-law of the feudal lords and kings. *Hai* pairs with *chen*, and *mao* pairs with *xu*. *Chen* and *xu* are the household women of the Grand Empress. *You* belongs to *wu*, the Lesser Empress. *Zi* belongs to *si*, and *si* is the son-in-law of the Emperor’s younger sister. Do you understand, Perfected One?"

"Yes, yes."

"Thus, the Stems are the Emperors and Kings, and the Branches are also Emperors and Kings. Therefore, *yin* is the Branch of *jia*, so *chou* and *wei* are called the rear palaces. *Wu* is the Branch of *bing*, so *you* is called the rear palace. *Mao* is the Branch of *yi*, so *shen* is called the son-in-law of the feudal lords and kings. *Chen* is the Branch of *wu*, so it is called the household of the Grand Empress. *Hai* is the Branch of *gui*, so it is called the household woman of the Grand Empress. *Zi* is the Branch of *ren*, so it is called the son-in-law of the Emperor’s younger sister. *Si* is the Branch of *ding*, so it is called the Emperor’s younger sister. Such is the law of Heaven and Earth’s mutual correspondence and harmony."

"Excellent, excellent! I wish to inquire further: why is it that these *chen* and *xu* lords, when unmarried, gather together, and when women, they marry collectively?"

"How subtle! Your question is most profound."

"Now, Heaven is the utmost *yang*, while Earth is the utmost *yin*. Earth is multitudinous, for it is the chief of all *yin*. *Yin* is always even in number, hence the pairing."

"Yet *wu* and *si* share the same earthly position—why are they not paired?"

"Excellent question! *Wu* and *si* are the fifth stems, the *yang* of Earth, their positions belonging to Heaven, and thus they are not paired. Does the Perfected One understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go then, for you have grasped it. Your inquiry is most apt. Now, the Five Phases’ characters rotate and complement one another to encompass all matters under Heaven. Having received my writings, you must reflect upon their categories and hidden meanings—above and below, the six directions, all is complete and profound. Thus the sage, seeing one, knows ten thousand; the great worthy, seeing one, knows a thousand; the foolish, straining to comprehend, remain confused and fail to attain the true Dao. Therefore, the Way and its *virtue* are entrusted to the Perfected One. Does the Perfected One understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go then, for you have understood. I now wish to inquire further on one more matter."

"Now, the four seasons of the heavens above and the Five Phases of the earth below—do they all extend to the households of the Thearchs, Emperors, feudal lords, kings, and the inner palaces? The celestial Dao exhaustively matches them all. But is there also a matching for the myriad commoners and the ten thousand things?"

"Excellent indeed is your question! It may be called perceiving the essentials of the great Dao. Yet this matching is all of a kind. As for the Five Phases, at their apex are the Thearchs and Kings; next are the ministers; next, the subtle qi. The Kings occupy the position of Thearchs and Kings. The ministers occupy the position of great officials. The subtle qi occupies the position of petty officers. After the Kings comes the aged qi, which is the position of feudal lords. After the aged qi comes the declining qi, which is the position of the imperial clan. After the declining qi comes the ailing qi, which is the omen of the imperial clan violating the law and losing its succession. After the ailing qi comes the imprisoned qi, which is the omen of the commoners and the myriad people. After the imprisoned qi comes the dead qi, which is the omen of slaves and bondservants. After the dead qi comes the vanished qi, which is the tombs of the dead. Thus, Heaven displays its signs: the four seasons and Five Phases cycle through, each rising and declining in turn. The people and the ten thousand things all follow the celestial pattern, also rising and declining in turn. Therefore, the myriad commoners are all descendants of the hundred kings—when flourishing, they become lords of men; when declining, they become commoners. Does the Perfected One understand this?"

"Yes, yes."

"You have grasped it."

Here the *Tianchen* prognostications are employed to govern the state of Chang’an, to suppress treacherous ministers, and to eradicate deceit, cunning, and falsehood. *Tai Ping Jing: Collated and Annotated Edition*, Scroll Seventy, Wu Section, Part Two. *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Seventy. "The Secret of Scholars’ Gains and Losses," One Hundred and Six.

The Perfected One respectfully inquired: "I now wish to compile and rectify all the texts written by my master, both prior and subsequent, so that scholars may not speak recklessly. May I hear of this?"

"Excellent! How your mastery grows day by day.

Now, my Daoist methods proceed by measuring yang when going forth and measuring yin when withdrawing; they proceed by measuring conduct when going forth and measuring spirit when withdrawing; they proceed by measuring the multitude of texts when going forth and measuring the multitude of charts when withdrawing; they proceed by dispelling calamities when going forth and rectifying the self when withdrawing; they proceed by measuring the learning of the court when going forth and measuring the inner chamber when withdrawing. In all matters, they impose limits. Those who strive diligently in their studies each employ their own talents and abilities, yet if they deviate from the constant method, those who study externally will fall into superficiality and be unable to restrain themselves, while those who study internally will fail to align with the correct path and instead plunge into great deviation.

Scholars invariably suffer from a grave affliction: they are unable to recognize it themselves. Those who favor external learning and whose talents exceed the proper measure often fall into superficiality, causing the Dao to become greatly deviant and devoid of correct texts, yet they falsely claim it as the true Dao and deceive one another. Those who favor internal learning and whose talents exceed the proper measure often plunge into great deviation, believing they have attained it. They do not speak with others, thus losing the proper method and transmitting false teachings.

Now you harbor doubts, which is why you have come to ask again. Since your intentions are earnest and unwavering, I shall establish rules and limits for you, so that each may have boundaries to discuss and adhere to.

Ancient and modern texts are too numerous to be confined. In all learning, those who delight in attaining the true essence must not deviate from the root. Those who learn from the oral instructions of their master must not deviate from their master’s words—this is the great essential principle.

The greatest harm in learning lies in this: when external studies align with superficial chapters and phrases, they become increasingly shallow, leading to empty words and reckless speech. When internal studies align with charts and prognostications, they fail to deeply grasp the essential meaning and instead speak erroneously. Those who study longevity and go forth, aligning with superficiality, deceive one another; those who align internally but fail to grasp the essential meaning instead fall into great deviation.

Now that you have come to ask repeatedly, I shall expound these texts for you and reveal their limits. What aligns with the method is correct; what does not align is incorrect—this is clear. You may thus come to understand it.

All texts are the discourse of Heaven. Those where ten correspond to ten are correct; those where nine correspond to ten are slightly deviant; those where eight correspond to ten are slightly disordered. Anything below this is not true and cannot be employed. They are called texts that disorder the celestial patterns and earthly principles, displease yin and yang, cause the myriad things to struggle, and bring great misfortune upon the people.

The method of nurturing one’s nature involves inwardly perceiving one’s form and appearance—what is manifestly clear is correct. Outwardly perceiving the spirits of the myriad things is incorrect.

In studying all matters, one must constantly uphold the original text and seek the explanations of many worthies to stabilize it—this is correct. Upholding the multitude of chapters and phrases while forgetting the original matter is incorrect and loses the intent of the celestial Dao.

What enables a person’s body to transform into spirit is correct. A body without the Dao that does not become spirit yet claims to command spirits is incorrect—it is merely a technique for manipulating them through texts.

Explaining all matters such that their root, branches, and center resemble one another is correct; what does not resemble is incorrect.

Entering seclusion, initially eating little, and over time consuming qi until one departs and vanishes—this is correct. Seeking the Dao, claiming to have attained it without returning, and refusing questions—this is incorrect.

All who depart must return; those who teach and answer questions are correct. Those who do not teach or answer questions yet feign death are incorrect.

Abiding in purity and stillness within a secluded chamber and achieving success—this is correct. Claiming to have attained the Dao and conduct while speaking with anger—this is incorrect, for such a person has lost their essence.

Entering learning and daily improving, surpassing one’s former state—this is attaining the Dao. Entering learning yet daily worsening, lacking loyalty and trustworthiness—this is incorrect, for one has fallen into great deviation.

Reading books and perceiving their meaning, then upholding the master’s instructions to seek explanations and clarifications—this is correct. Reading books without the master’s instructions and instead claiming deep, solitary understanding—this is incorrect, for one has inwardly lost the guiding intent of the great Dao.

Having attained the Dao, one must steadfastly serve many masters and worthies without negligence—this is the way of daily progress.

Thus, the ancient sagely masters, having attained the Dao, still served their masters as before and dared not cease. After leaving their masters, they continued to read the texts diligently. Those who study yet claim to have attained the essential meaning on their own, no longer striving to read the ancient texts and sagely words, and who claim correctness without serving the many enlightened sages—these are foolish people.

In all learning, thoroughly investigating what can be sought—this is correct. All things are thus: once born, they all can fulfill their lifespan and bear fruit—this is correct. Merely being born yet failing to fulfill their lifespan, lacking trustworthiness and substance—this is incorrect.

Doing good and attaining its proper fruition—this is correct. Failing to attain its proper fruition, appearing correct outwardly yet being incorrect inwardly—this is false.

Reading my books in their entirety without deviating from the guiding principles and attaining their true essence—this is correct. Reading books and producing oddities, possessing much talent yet failing to grasp their essential truth—this is incorrect.

Heaven has wind and rain, and the myriad things are born in due season—this is correct. Wind and rain yet the myriad things are harmed—this is incorrect, for it contains poison.

Practicing the Daoist classics and daily flourishing—this is correct. Not daily progressing but instead daily declining, inwardly losing the intent of one’s conduct—this is incorrect.

Thus, the nature of Heaven and Earth is such that when one does good, if it is not immediately manifested in one’s person, it flows to later generations to illuminate one’s conduct."

Those who do evil will likewise not be immediately halted in their persons, but will inevitably flow to later generations, thereby revealing their misguided conduct. Thus, the consequences of good and evil will invariably manifest.

Yet those who do good are like the sun rising at dawn—ever more radiant and luminous. Those who do evil are like the sun setting at dusk—ever more obscure and dark. Such is the natural disposition of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang.

Heaven generates the myriad things, each made manifest according to its conduct, never concealed. Thus, the good ascend and their fate belongs to Heaven, just as the living belong to Heaven. The evil descend and their fate belongs to Earth, just as the dead, being impure, descend to the Yellow Springs—this is what is meant.

To those who obtain my books, I entrust them to the noble lord of supreme virtue. I possess these writings and dare not obstruct or withhold their transmission and study.

The Dao of Heaven governs Heaven, yet it cannot be fully known; one must not heed the words of a single person. Therefore, I have now established the texts of the ancient sages for you, once more distilling their essential concord, clarifying how the earlier and later passages mutually corroborate.

Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, though the worthy and sagely have lived in different eras, separated by vast stretches of time, what they detested was the same. Together they discoursed on Heaven’s behalf, remedying the world’s gains and losses. Their words resemble one another like overlapping compasses or aligned squares, mutually illuminating—this could not be otherwise.

For things of the same kind gather and arise together; their principles all operate through resonance by likeness and image—this is evident proof. What was lost in the past is regained in the future; examining their similarities and differences completes the text.

By adhering to antiquity to illuminate the present, collectively deliberating their matters, one may take inner texts to clarify outer texts, and outer texts to verify inner texts. Thus may they be transmitted for ten thousand generations, without ever again offending Heaven.

The words of one person cannot be followed alone. The words of many, deeply examined and drawn from the sayings of the ancient worthy and sagely, inwardly accord with Heaven. Together they are established and set forth.

When the emperor daily clarifies the decisive principles, all confusions, disorders, calamities, and evils are dispelled. Heaven has no repeated sorrows; those who work in concert prosper, while those who resist and rebel find their misfortunes unremoved.

*Here ends the decisive principles on scholars’ gains and losses.*

**The Combined Collated Scroll Seventy-One, Wu Section Part Three**
**Scroll Seventy-One of the Scripture of Great Peace**
**The Ninefold True Dao: Textual Decisions on Gains and Losses, One Hundred and Seven**

The Perfected One bowed twice and said, "I beg to ask one matter."
"Very well, speak."
The Perfected One began: "Now the Celestial Master has issued forth the qi of Great Peace to bestow the Dao and its virtue, thereby raising up the supreme emperor. Above, there is a ruler who delights in the Dao and its virtue; below, even the foolish and humble common folk are reached. Its grace penetrates the six directions, harmonizes the eight limits, and enfolds all without exception.

Yet now, though the worthy receive the Master’s literary teachings and apply their thoughts to the Dao, what is the ultimate aim above, and what is the final limit below?"
"Excellent! How subtle and essential is the Perfected One’s question. Does he wish to hear of the utmost extremes, to know the advance and retreat of the numinous?"
"Truly, I am benighted and dull, unequal to the task. Only the enlightened Master may record and instruct me."
"Very well.

The Dao has nine degrees, each distinguished by different names. Now I shall set forth their meanings in full for the Perfected One. Follow along and record them, lest anything be lost."
"Indeed, indeed."
"Thus:

The first is called the Primal Qi of Non-Action.
The second, Concentrated Stillness and Emptiness.
The third, Numerical Measurement and Distinction.
The fourth, Numinous Excursion—Departure and Return.
The fifth, the Great Dao’s Spirit, akin to the Four Seasons and Five Phases.
The sixth, Piercing Joy.
The seventh, Community Deliberation.
The eighth, Overflowing Spirit.
The ninth, Ancestral Forebears.

Each of these nine is further divided into nine, yielding eighty-one sections. Though their forms differ and their texts vary, when employed in secrecy, they unite as one great root, with the numinous as their agent and humans as their gateway.

Now, I shall arrange them for you in ordered decisions. It is impossible to record them all in advance; you must ponder their meanings yourself. The upper three nines—twenty-seven in all—can transcend the world. The central three nines—twenty-seven in all—can command the Perfected Spirit Officials. The lower three nines—twenty-seven in all—abound in perversity; their spirits and essences cannot be constantly employed. They cause people to grow confused and disoriented, and among them, there are often those who lack precision, uttering many reckless words, like one who has lost their qi."
"Now, this foolish student has heard the Master’s words but is dazzled and knows not east from west. I beg you to explain them separately for this dull and ignorant one."
"Very well.

The first, the Primal Qi of Non-Action, is to contemplate one’s body, doing nothing at all, but only envisioning it as utterly luminous, like qi relinquished and formless. Constantly take this as the method. Once perfected, there will be nothing one cannot do, nothing one does not know. Thus, when a person is without the Dao, they are merely human; when they attain the Dao, they transform into divine immortals. Their spirit ascends to Heaven, following Heaven’s transformations—this is the meaning of ‘nothing one cannot do.’

The second, Emptiness and Spontaneity, is to guard the form, penetrating emptiness and spontaneity, without any strangeness. The body’s interior shines white, above and below like jade, without flaw. Practiced over a long time, this too is a method for transcending the world. It is the image following the Primal Qi of Non-Action.

The third, Numerical Measurement, is to accumulate essence and inwardly observe oneself, counting from the hair down to the feet, distinguishing the five fingers, the body’s external and internal forms—nothing is left uncounted. Knowing its meaning, one should constantly take this as their contemplation, not losing even a fraction. This too is a lesser method for transcending the world, following Emptiness and Spontaneity.

The fourth, Numinous Excursion—Departure and Return, is to visualize the spirits of the five viscera, which by day go out and enter, seeing their movements and travels. One may speak with them. Contemplating and following the spirit’s comings and goings, one also clearly perceives the body. This enables knowledge of good and ill fortune, following Numerical Measurement.

The fifth, the Great Dao’s Spirit, is when the human spirit emerges and becomes akin to the Five Phases and Four Seasons. Green, red, white, yellow, and black—all correspond to the spirits of the viscera. As they go out and enter, come and go, the spirit officials of the Four Seasons and Five Phases serve the person. This is called the Complete Dao, capable of subduing all perversities.

The sixth, Piercing Joy, is to pierce and strike the earth. Each Daoist spirit has its own canon, and by the family’s methods, the spirits are summoned to wander. Half resemble the Perfected, half resemble perversities, and they often make people fond of cleverness. They cannot be constantly employed, and over time, they bring sorrow to people.

The seventh, Community Deliberation, involves the spirits of Heaven and Earth, the Four Seasons, the altars of soil and grain, mountains and rivers—all are spirits that descend to humans. They cause people to grow confused, desiring to recklessly speak of their spirits, which are violent, vengeful, mad, and perverse. They must not be recklessly invoked.

The eighth, Overflowing Spirit, refers to spirits that overflow, their Dao having nothing to which they may be tethered. They are the essential qi of the world descending to humans, causing people to speak recklessly. Half resemble the Perfected, half resemble perversities.

The ninth, Ancestral Forebears, involves purely seeing ghosts, without any true Dao. Those who summon them call forth only the ghosts of the dead.

This is the lowest extreme of the Dao, called the path of the inferior scholar. Those who attain the upper Dao can also employ the lower, but those who attain the lower Dao cannot employ the upper."
"Now, I wish to hear why there are these upper and lower distinctions."
"Ah, this arises from the conduct of people. Those who guard the root attain the upper; those who delight in the spirit’s excursions in and out of the body attain the middle. Foolish people damage their root and guard the branches, and those who wander with other spirits attain the lower.

Those who guard the root can fully perceive them; those who guard the middle can perceive half; those who guard the branches cannot return to mirror and perceive the Dao. Thus, all who study must obtain an enlightened master. Without an enlightened master, they lose the way.

Therefore, the transmission from master to master is firmer than metal and stone. Without transmission from a master, it is called reckless practice, which invites misfortune and perversity. Perfected One, be cautious, be cautious!"
"Indeed, indeed."
"Thus, in ancient times, those who studied the sagely and worthy and obtained an enlightened master were called ‘reborn.’ Those who did not obtain an enlightened master were called ‘confusers of the scriptures.’"

Thus, the worthy and sagely all serve masters to achieve completion; without a master, the Dao does not arise of itself.

"Excellent, excellent!"

"Perfected One, if you wish to know its effects: consider a person dwelling in a village of the greatly worthy—they become greatly worthy; dwelling in a village of the moderately worthy—they become moderately worthy; dwelling in a village of the unworthy—they become unworthy, ever falling short. This is what is meant. Those who study this Dao must examine and deliberate upon it—this is the essential Dao of Heaven. Be cautious, be cautious!"

"Indeed, indeed."

"Go forth, for the Dao returns to its rightful person, to be entrusted to the worthy and enlightened."

"Indeed, indeed. This is the divine formula and essential Dao."

*Right [Section]:* The Nine Chapters of the True Dao on Gains and Losses
*First of the One Hundred and Eight Texts on Receiving the Dao’s Precepts to Attain Goodness and Dispel Evil*

The Perfected One asked the Divine Person, "By what does one receive the Dao’s precepts?"

The Divine Person replied, "The Dao has great precepts—one must not fail to be cautious. When one is about to attain the Dao, on the verge of its completion, one then engages with all spirits, dwelling as neighbors to essence and spirit, meeting and seeing one another in entry and exit, loving one another as father and son. The Dao is a weighty matter. Some may regret bestowing it upon others and seek to seize another’s Dao, so they first test a person to see if they are steadfast. They come together to deceive, causing one to speak recklessly. If you obtain their words, guard them firmly and take care never to transmit them—then you may attain longevity. With time, you may attain the true Dao. To transmit them is to invite daily dissipation. Moreover, it makes one cherish life and detest harm."

The Perfected One said, "I wish to hear the meaning of ‘daily dissipation.’"

"When essence and spirit dissipate, the body dies. The Dao of emptiness and absolute profundity constantly urges one to cherish life and detest killing, to seal the mouth and prevent leakage—then one may endure for ten thousand times ten thousand years."

The Perfected One asked the Divine Person, "I wish to hear the prohibitions against leakage."

The Divine Person said, "If a great person leaks it, they lose their position; if a middling person leaks it, their qi is severed; if a petty person leaks it, their lineage is extinguished. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth use this to distinguish themselves and maintain their privacy, so the divine particularly values it."

"If Heaven and Earth did not profoundly know the Dao of absolute profundity, how could they be divine? How could they be long-lived?"

"Remember this—I tell you: value its essence, guard it, and be cautious."

The Perfected One assented repeatedly, not daring to speak recklessly.

The Perfected One bowed deeply and said, "I wish to hear further: when they seek to corrupt a person, what is to be done?"

The Divine Person replied, "When there is malice in a person’s heart, great evil comes to deceive. If one can firmly seal their ears and not listen to their words, it is auspicious; if one listens to their words, it brings misfortune and harm. If a ruler listens, they will despise their ministers, claiming they are disloyal and intend rebellion. If ministers or children listen, they will despise their ruler or father, and the deceivers will come, saying, ‘Now you shall become a sage’ or ‘Now you shall become a ruler.’ If petty people listen, they will make one boast of their own greatness. If a father listens, he will despise his son; if a son listens, he will despise his father. Their words shift and change, confusing the heart and mind, speaking now of good, now of evil, disrupting governance. One moment joy, the next anger—this is the great flattery of evil, bent on harming others. From ancient times to the present, those who study long life have all failed to overcome these words."

The Perfected One asked, "What is to be done?"

The Divine Person said, "Seal your ears and do not listen; seal your mouth and do not speak. These are but flattering evils—there is nothing worth hearing. To listen is to lose the true Dao, and once it departs, death follows. If you wish to endure, be cautious of these words. I have already warned you beforehand, for how often have you been ensnared by this great evil? I constantly rectify my own heart and no longer heed them. This great evil constantly accumulates, seeking to observe whether a person is steadfast. The cunning evil may even enter a person’s abdomen, stirring their heart to reckless action. Sometimes joy, sometimes anger, unable to restrain oneself—all are misled by evil, pushed by evil, and many perish. Those who accumulate much in this way must carefully observe these weighty precepts; the heart must not be swayed. This is not only for those who study the Dao—common people, too, are subject to unpredictable joy and anger. You must be cautious and refine yourself."

The Perfected One assented repeatedly.

The Perfected One said, "I myself have been afflicted by great evil, making me wish to boast, saying, ‘I shall become a ruler, and later ascend as a flying immortal to Heaven.’ I believed their words and rejoiced greatly. Later, I suffered from madness for three months. When I saw the Divine Person and Heavenly Master, my heart was filled with great joy. I have personally experienced such affliction, nearly succumbing to severe illness. Later, the madness ceased and I recovered, thus attaining several thousand years of life. Now, by good fortune, I meet the Divine Person again, receive the Dao’s precepts anew, and behold the gateway, hoping to endure long and become an official of Heaven."

The Divine Person said, "If you maintain such firmness of heart and will, what worry is there that you will not ascend to the Nine Heavens and traverse the Twenty-Five Heavens? All those who attain the heavens now do so by holding fast to a firm and secret heart, allowing no error. Those who can be confused and misled all die prematurely and fail to transcend. If you wish for long life, study this text as a weighty precept—this is the precept of life and death, and you must not fail to be cautious. Thus, the ancient sages and worthies who first transcended the world did not rely on this power. Those who study the Dao yet fail to attain it and do not transcend all sit and listen to this, falling prey to its harm. The great gods of Heaven cannot be usurped by such deceivers; they cause one to suffer this harm and subjugation, thus forfeiting great fortune."

"To turn life into death is to become a celestial thief. Now, all the teachings I impart to you, Perfected One, can grant you great longevity. Some may transcend the world, but you must hold fast and guard yourself, lest this become harm. If you can focus your heart with utmost care, you may attain boundless years." The Perfected One assented repeatedly. "I dare not act wrongly; I humbly receive your luminous precepts."

The divine being said, "Your devotion to the Dao is thus—when you accomplish this, you will ascend the steps to Heaven. Perfected One, do you inquire about precepts only in this regard? Are there deeper ones? There are also the precepts of the Upper Heavens, which are steadfast in restraining people. Those who preach precepts with deceitful words exalt themselves as noble, using them to mislead others. Thus, they cause people to violate prohibitions and incur execution. They repeatedly test people with jade maidens, enticing them to wander together, then mock those who succumb as base, only to bring ruin upon their bodies. Yet if one remains ever silent, lives ten thousand years without heeding such things, and guards their fate alone, what harm could befall them? Between life and death, this is the crux."

The Perfected One assented repeatedly. The Perfected One asked, "Why does Heaven specifically send evil spirits to test people?" The divine being replied, "The Dao is weighty and difficult to share with others. Only those whose resolve is unshakable, who would die before abandoning their aspiration, will not have their wishes stolen. Those who transcend the world in Heaven are not covetous of honor or nobility; they simply delight in life itself. There is no extraordinary Dao here. Remember my precepts, and you will... My words must never be forgotten for ten thousand generations. Even if you ascend to traverse the boundless heavens above, the precepts remain thus—there is nothing extraordinary beyond them."

The Perfected One assented repeatedly, saying, "I dare not stray from the guiding line." The divine being said, "If you truly speak thus, you have already attained the Dao. The auspicious will advance daily, while the wicked will cease their ascent. Holding your heart in this way, you fulfill the divine precepts. When you accomplish this, you will ride clouds and mount dragons, roaming the eight directions. The Great Dao is vast and smooth—you have already attained it. Your life will be everlasting and boundless."

The Perfected One said, "Indeed." The divine being continued, "The Dao is truly great, without inner or outer bounds. Yet I constantly fear it may be harmed by great evil, for if one does not heed even a single evil, how could evil ever prevail? Thus, the ancient emperors and kings who loved the Dao and studied it, refusing to listen to evil, all attained boundless years. Those who heeded and followed evil words all brought ruin upon themselves. My Dao has myriad facets, and you must understand their benefits and harms."

The Perfected One assented repeatedly. "Now that I have received the divine being’s words, can I attain long life in an instant?" The divine being replied, "Without deep precepts, your accomplishment will... be inauspicious, and the Dao will not be attained."

The Perfected One said, "Is my life fated to have such fortune? Is it mere luck that I have encountered a divine being?" The divine being replied, "Yes. The lives of the Six Kinds of People each have their own destiny: the first are divine beings, the second are Perfected Ones, the third are immortals, the fourth are Daoists, the fifth are sages, and the sixth are worthies. All assist Heaven in governance. Divine beings govern Heaven, Perfected Ones govern Earth, immortals govern wind and rain, Daoists govern teachings of fortune and misfortune, sages govern the people, and worthies assist sages in managing the records of the myriad people, supplementing the deficiencies of the Six Directions. Thus, each person’s life has its own destiny. The noble cannot become base, nor can the base become noble.

If you wish to know the truth of this, consider the fish: though it dwells in water, it cannot soar without the water’s qi. The dragon, too, dwells in water, yet only by relying on the water’s qi can it ascend to the azure clouds and become Heaven’s messenger. Nobility and baseness are truly matters of destiny—fools speak recklessly. The ancient sage-kings and emperors, in their great wisdom, never heeded false words, knowing their... and that it was impossible to achieve. This is like teaching a person without the Dao to suddenly fly—how could they truly soar? Only those who attain the Dao and become immortals can fly. When the common people idly claim, 'I can fly,' yet cannot, their reckless words are just like this."

The Perfected One said, "Excellent! I have awakened to this." The divine being continued...

"Can one, being foolish as you are, forcibly attain Heaven’s mandate?" The Perfected One said, "Then can this Dao also be studied?" The divine being replied, "Indeed. Those with Heaven’s mandate who study it will surely attain great capacity; those of middling virtue who study it may also attain long life; even the foolish who pursue it may gain modest longevity. Do you wish to know its effect? It is like the common man who studies: the greatly virtuous who study may attain high office; those of middling virtue who study may attain middling office; the foolish who study may become petty officials. Are petty officials not still set above the common folk? Thus, one should still strive to study."

The Perfected One assented, "I shall practice it and never dare grow lax." The divine being said, "Then exert yourself and trust in the Dao. Between Heaven and Earth, each takes what is fitting—there is no falsehood in this." The Perfected One assented again, "I shall revere Heaven and honor Earth, respect my superiors and cherish my inferiors, follow the four seasons and the five phases in all I do, and never dare transgress."

The divine being exclaimed, "Excellent! Excellent! You have grasped the meaning of the Dao. I need not instruct you further."

"Method for Fasting, Meditating on the Divine, and Rescuing from Death, One Hundred and Ninth"

The Perfected Writs of the Six Directions prostrated again and inquired: "Previously, we received the Celestial Master’s teaching that the Qi of Great Peace is about to descend, and that the harmonization of yin and yang depends first upon harmonizing with the divine spirits, each returning to their proper places. Reflecting deeply upon the Celestial Master’s words, we find that those who can reverse illumination and penetrate with clarity may perceive all things one by one. Yet such people are numerous—how can this be achieved? Can all Daoist adepts who possess penetrating reverse illumination gather them together?"

"Ah! Excellent indeed! The August Qi of Heaven is soon to arrive, and the Emperor-King shall govern with folded arms, free from care. Thus, Heaven has sent the various Perfected Ones to inquire in full about the essentials of the supreme Dao, which may serve as the great virtue of an enlightened ruler to eradicate the lingering disasters and inherited burdens of former kings, as well as the malevolent qi, demonic entities, treacherous spirits, and baleful influences that bring harm between Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the Perfected Ones have come to inquire in detail about these essentials of the supreme Dao. Do your disciples not already know this of themselves?"

"We suddenly do not know it of ourselves."

"If you suddenly do not know it of yourselves, why do you ask?"

"Reflecting upon the Celestial Master’s teachings, there are points we do not understand. Since we do not know of ourselves how to gather these rare, profoundly tranquil, reverse-illuminating adepts who can perceive the strange and uncanny, we have come together to ask about it."

"Excellent! The Perfected One’s dedication advances ever further, for you now question this. Heaven has sent you to inquire fully on behalf of a virtuous ruler about what may resolve these doubts."

"Very well."

"Now, I shall explain in full for the Perfected Ones, distinguishing and clarifying the essential meanings of the Dao. Sit calmly and record it together."

"Yes, yes."

*(Rising)* "Heaven and Earth possess their own divine treasures, each with its own divine essence and radiance. These follow the five phases in color and wax and wane with the qi of the four seasons, serving as Heaven and Earth’s envoys to bring forth the myriad people and things. Between Heaven and Earth, within yin and yang, none are not born through the transformative power of their virtue." *(Ceasing)*

Those who grasp its meaning may immediately perceive it; those who fail to grasp its great essentials have no gateway to knowledge. Those who can greatly open and apply it shall attain great fortune, able to dispel the afflictions, sufferings, malevolence, and evil that plague people between Heaven and Earth. Those who do not know its great method cannot recklessly summon or employ the divine in vain.

"We wish to hear its meaning, that it may be transmitted for ten thousand generations without error."

"Excellent is your question! Yet to await and obtain its technique, there is a great method: the qi of the four seasons and five phases enters the human abdomen to become the spirits of the five viscera, their colors corresponding to those of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons. When depicted as a person, let the three be united: the qi of the ruling phase covers the exterior, the qi of the ministering phase follows, and the qi of the retiring phase resides innermost, with their collars and sleeves visible.

First, fast and reside in seclusion, in a tranquil place. Meditate upon and contemplate it, then create its painted image, its length as you will. For five persons, depict them together upon five feet of plain silk. Let them be of good virtue: men should meditate upon men, women upon women—thus shall the painted images be made. These writings are already numerous, not merely one version. From top to bottom, discuss their meanings and create them accordingly, transmitting the texts to mutually elucidate their subtleties. Though my writings are many, they have a great division: texts are grouped by category, and characters clarify one another, so that their essential meaning is fully attained."

"Yes, yes."

"This spirit of the four seasons and five phases enters to become the spirit of the five viscera and emerges to become the divine essence of the four seasons and five phases. Those close to humans are called the spirits of the five virtues, resembling the visceral spirits of humans. Those distant from humans are called the Yang Registers, styled the Four Seasons’ Troops and Horses, which may repel malevolence and act in accordance with the waxing and waning of the four seasons’ qi.

The method for depicting them in full: let the person be clad in triple-layered robes, with the ruling qi on the exterior, the ministering qi next, and the retiring qi innermost. All wear caps and headbands and ride horses, the horses also depicted in the colors of the five phases. First, paint the image on one side, two zhang in length. On five silks, loosely depict twenty-five riders in five groups of five. Craft them well.

The riders of the East hold spears; those of the South hold halberds; those of the West hold bows, crossbows, and axes; those of the North hold shields, bucklers, and swords; and those of the Center hold swords and drums. In meditation, one should first perceive these inner spirits, then perceive these outer spirits. Alternatively, one may first see the yang spirits and then the inner spirits. To perceive them thus is to follow this method, which has no fixed form. One must also receive the master’s oral instructions and teachings. There is a crucial point at the outset: those who know it may easily transmit it, saying that it is easily attained and easily accomplished. It is fitting to practice it far from others, in a secluded place, for it is easily gathered when near people but difficult to accomplish.

When the Dao is accomplished, it is called the Gathering of the Great, Utterly Reversed, Penetrating Illumination. If the manifestations of illness are not numerous, many is auspicious, few is inauspicious."

"In cases where the treatment is insufficient, the resolution unclear, and the cure not achieved, how many should be gathered to suffice?"

"At the highest, ten thousand; at the middle, four or five thousand; at the lowest, several hundred, or a hundred and several tens."

"Why so many?"

"Ah!"

Should the Perfected One yet remain in former ignorance? Be seated, and I shall now expound for you its great essential meaning.

In the aftermath of inherited burdens, Heaven and Earth suffer abundant calamities. Ghostly beings, ancient spirits, malevolent forces, and corpse-borne misfortunes are manifold. Moreover, there are wind-damp sores, scabies, and in this late age, countless flowing disasters—too many to name. Some bear a hundred illnesses; others, several dozen. Suppose each person harbors fears, some of which may shorten life. If each could dispel but one affliction: the diviner skilled in hexagrams might remove one baleful malady; the master physician versed in formulas, another; the acupuncturist adept in channels and vessels, yet another; the moxibustionist, one more; the exorcist, still another; the invoker who commands spirits to guide and inspect ghosts, one further; and the sacrificer, one last. These seven, each removing one illness, would together dispel seven. Yet in this late age, people suffer many diseases—some claim ten or more, even a hundred—all bearing unrelenting distress. Though every skilled artisan may remove one affliction, together they dispel but seven, leaving the rest untouched. When the seven artisans have exhausted their strength, the remaining illnesses persist, still tormenting the sufferer. Over time, they bring exhaustion, and thus many perish, unable to escape their dire straits.

How many years of natural span does a person enjoy? How many illnesses do they witness? They encounter calamities, meet with decline and prosperity, advance and retreat. Heaven’s standard follows the waxing and waning of the four seasons and five phases. The eight trigrams, Qian and Kun, embody Heaven and Earth, yet even they have times of rest, imprisonment, decay, and depletion of qi—how much more so for humans? Humans mirror Heaven and Earth, following the four seasons, five phases, six conjunctions, and eight directions, ever alternating between flourishing and decline, without respite. Thus, one must prepare in advance, remedy the sources of fortune and misfortune, remain vigilant in peace, mindful in survival, orderly in governance, and ever aware of chaos. Only then can one endure.

Therefore, in the method of treating perverse influences, the Daoist’s illnesses are not numerous. If one person can dispel one illness, ten people dispel ten, a hundred dispel a hundred, a thousand dispel a thousand, and ten thousand dispel ten thousand. How could one body bear ten thousand illnesses? Thus, all may be decisively cured. Do you understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Hence, instruct them to prepare in advance and gather those who have accomplished the Dao.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go forth, for you now understand. Proceed, Perfected One, and clearly set forth these teachings.

The illnesses treated here are great perverse influences of ghostly beings, acting as thieves and bandits. When the emperor and king enjoy peace, they maintain armies and generals. Weapons, meant to guard against others, may instead become instruments of treachery. Thus, one who dares to die cannot be withstood by ten; ten who dare to die, not by a hundred; a hundred, not by a thousand; a thousand, not by ten thousand. Ten thousand who dare to die may advance unhindered in all directions. To prepare for illness, injury, and harm, an army of twelve thousand is maintained for emergencies. The two thousand serve only to replace those resting or in retreat, ensuring their submission. Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Excellent, you have understood.”

**110. Against Grand Words Without Effective Methods**

The Perfected One asked, “May I inquire of the Heavenly Master: now that the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, should not perverse qi be thought to dissipate and depart?”

“Indeed, what you say is both correct and incorrect. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, perverse influences should naturally vanish. Yet since the opening of Heaven and Earth, perverse qi has accumulated over long ages, vast and numerous, passing down burdens through generations. Though the governing qi of Great Peace has come, how could it suddenly and completely eradicate all this? Thus, one must prepare in advance. To wait until adversity has trapped one in distress before seeking skilled masters is already far too late.

In the highest antiquity, each person knew the true Dao, and perverse qi was scarce. From the middle antiquity of the Most High onward, people grew foolish, delighting in superficial adornments and neglecting the true Dao. With rampant perverse qi, mad spirits, and calamities, many died prematurely, their Heaven-appointed years cut short. All this arose from benighted minds, unable to foresee and guard against the root.

Now, the ruler of supreme virtue governs, and Heaven cherishes him, unwilling to let his people suffer like those foolish multitudes. He must swiftly perfect his great virtue and align his heart with Heaven. Thus, Heaven has sent the various Perfected Ones to seek answers, bidding me expound the methods that can suppress and repel inauspicious and malevolent influences. For this, I have explained everything to the Perfected One in full. Yet now you say that perverse influences will vanish on their own and no preparations are needed—this is incorrect, a grave misstatement that misleads the noble-minded. Your words cannot be heeded.”

“What do you mean?”

“When a great emergency arises and one seeks remedies afterward, they cannot be swiftly obtained, leaving people in dire straits. Thus, your words are gravely mistaken and cannot be followed.

Now, grain fills the granaries to prepare for famine. I have made these teachings clear for the Perfected One, so they may endure for ten thousand generations without being forgotten.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“If one waits until hunger strikes to teach people to plant grain, instructing them to till and cultivate, waiting for the rice to ripen before cooking it—would this not be too late? By then, they would already have starved. Or if one fails to sow in spring and, when winter hunger strikes, seeks to plant grain, yet the seeds do not sprout—could this save lives? Not only would the individual perish, but the entire household would be destroyed. This is one great folly of the Perfected One, the profound effect of utter ignorance.

Let me explain another matter: people dig wells to prepare for thirst. One should dwell near springs to guard against thirst. Yet if one waits until parched and near death to dig a well in search of water—how could this suffice? One would already be in dire straits. This is the Perfected One’s second folly, another mark of benightedness.

Let me explain yet another matter: in ancient times, people lived in caves; now, they build houses to guard against wind and rain. When there is no wind or rain, dwelling in the wild brings utmost joy. But when clouds gather, wind and rain arrive, and one then builds a house—by then, the cold rain would have already brought distress. This is the Perfected One’s third folly.

Let me explain one more matter: from the middle antiquity onward, sages established governments, building walled cities and deep moats to prepare for the unforeseen. In times of quiet peace, when all was well, if disorder arose and petty men sought to cause chaos, and only then did the noble-minded order the people to build walls and moats—would this not be too late for an emergency? This is the Perfected One’s most grievous folly, the effect of profound ignorance.

Let me explain one final matter: armies and generals are instruments of misfortune. The noble-minded should not possess them, and the lowly despise them. Thus, they should be sheathed, securely stored, and never prized or employed. They exist only to prepare for the unforeseen. Yet in an emergency, one would first have artisans strike stone to extract iron, smelt it into liquid, then have master smiths forge it ten thousand times to create a Moye blade for battle—would this not be too late? One would already be subdued, life and death decided. Is this not the sixth great folly of the Perfected One?”

“Very well, very well.”
“What may seem a fault is no fault—ponder matters thoroughly in your heart and mind before speaking, and thereafter do not speak lightly or recklessly.”
“Very well, very well.”
“Let me tell the Perfected One a small decision that, when reversed, illuminates the great. In ancient times, the sages and worthies devised combs and fine-toothed lice combs to prepare for tangled hair and lice. If a person is born and never combs, their hair becomes irreparably matted, and nits and lice grow beyond restraint. Only then would one seek fine wood from the southern mountains or rare ivory fit for comb-making, and have master craftsmen fashion them. By then, the hair is irreparably tangled, the lice in the head too numerous to count, all feeding on the person until the scalp festers with sores. Only then does one obtain combs and lice combs—already at the end of one’s resources.

Now let me present this small decision to the Perfected One, using the small to illustrate the great. By rivers, seas, and the five lakes, near the water’s edge swarms of mosquitoes and horseflies abound, yet one does not prepare in advance what might shield and defend against them. When mosquitoes and horseflies all emerge and take flight, coming together to feed on people, oxen, and horses—oxen and horses toss their heads and stamp, unable to eat; people grow deeply distressed, even to the point of death, with no respite—only then does one seek what might repel and defend against them. By then, one is utterly at the end of one’s resources. Does the Perfected One not clearly understand this?”
“Very well, very well.”

“Excellent, you have now awakened. The finest remedies can repel scabies mites; fine clothing and proper dwellings can repel fleas and lice. If one does not prepare these in advance, and only when afflicted by them seeks what might dispel them—by then, one is already deeply distressed, impoverished, and ailing. Do you understand this?”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“These are but the smallest of provisions among all things under heaven—how much more so for the greatest? Between heaven and earth, at all times there are violent ghosts, malevolent spirits, calamitous omens, and murderous specters. When they descend upon a person, it is as if arrows from blades, bows, and crossbows have struck the body. The pain they inflict is unbearable; in the most severe and sudden cases, one cannot even gasp for breath, cannot stand upright, and the body is seized by violent madness. It is like being in a desolate pavilion, far from the emperor’s officials, where one’s words are blocked and obstructed, unable to report an emergency. Only then does one seek skilled masters and elders to save oneself—by then, it is already too late. Words can no longer reach them; nothing more can be said.”

"Do you understand this?"
"Yes, yes."

"Good, you have awakened. Therefore, I am especially urgent. This death is the greatest misfortune under heaven. Thus, I have written these texts to instruct virtuous rulers to prepare in advance. The most wise, upon seeing my words, will fully awaken; those of middling wisdom will partially awaken; the foolish and unenlightened will not awaken but instead mock my writings for lacking fundamentals—thus, they have already reached their limit. For heaven, earth, and the emperor, nothing surpasses this in importance.

Now, as the qi of Great Peace arrives and the Yang virtue ruler governs, one may attain longevity. Yet death among all under heaven is no small matter: once dead, one never again sees the heavens, earth, sun, or moon—flesh and bone become dust. Death is a weighty affair. All people between heaven and earth receive but one life; none may be reborn. Only those who attain the Dao may be reborn after death, or achieve liberation through *shijie*. These are the ones heaven and earth favor—among ten thousand, not even one succeeds.

Thus, for ordinary people, once dead, there is no rebirth. Therefore, one must prepare thoroughly. Even in the era of Great Peace and abundant years, malevolent qi still exists. It is like a household that is generally good yet still harbors wicked individuals—one merely endures them. For this reason, it is all the more necessary to gather those skilled in the Dao and its arts: when the unwholesome arises, it must be swiftly eliminated. If not removed quickly, it will take root.

Thus, I teach that one should prepare by gathering many such people in advance. The purpose of great learning is to accumulate those of virtue and power, so they may be sought when needed. Without prior preparation, they cannot be obtained in haste. If an unforeseen event occurs and one wishes to consult past and present precedents, without those of great virtue and power already assembled, none will be able to respond or resolve doubts in time. Should a ruler be benighted and suddenly face a crisis, yet find no timely resolution to their distress, and only afterward seek wise masters from afar—how could this suffice when the matter is already at hand?

Perfected One, do you understand?"
"Yes, yes."

"Good, you have fully awakened."

"Though I may be reproached for speaking too much, if I do not ask, I will remain ignorant. I wish to clarify one matter: if the scale is vast—tens of thousands at the highest, thousands in the middle, or hundreds at the lowest—how can one swiftly gather and complete this?"

"Excellent, your question is apt. Simply teach a dozen people to perfect it, and let them in turn instruct others. In urgent cases, some will achieve success. Have the ruler of supreme virtue and power value and cherish them, rewarding those who succeed. The people will then aspire to it, and as their aspirations grow, they will follow willingly. Those who succeed will be universally respected and loved.

The spirits of the four seasons, five phases, heaven, and earth—seeing such reverence and love—will all rejoice, bringing good fortune to people. The virtuous ruler will long enjoy this blessed fortune, and from the wise down to the foolish, none will not vie to participate."

As those who practice grow daily more numerous, in time, both great and small will all be transformed. When every person can do this, then select and gather those with the greatest merit among them. Those with great merit shall be appointed to office, while those with lesser merit shall be rewarded. Thus, none under heaven will not desire to do this. Yet one may fear their numbers will be too vast to record—how could one worry there are too few?

O Perfected One, how profoundly foolish, benighted, and deluded you are! Those who make grand pronouncements without practical application are of no benefit to others. Simply follow the model, and those who consistently succeed are the ones who grasp the intent of the Dao and are greatly trusted. Those who know but a few words yet achieve no great results have not grasped the intent of the Dao and speak falsely—they are great flatterers, unfit for use, and only bring disorder to the Way. Do you understand, Perfected One?

"Yes, yes."

Go now, and be cautious and vigilant. Recite and study my writings, pondering their overarching meaning, grouping like with like, and using each to verify and complement the other. Then you will attain great understanding and know the direction in which my Dao points.

"Yes, yes."

The One Hundred and Eleventh Formula of the Five Spirits

"May I humbly inquire of a great formula: Why does the spirit of the East hold a spear?"

"Ah, there is no need to ask—Perfected One, you must already know this."

"The reason I ask is that the Heavenly Master might graciously pity later generations and establish a method. Without asking, future ages would not understand the intent and formula of the Heavenly Dao."

"Very well. This is the image of Heaven, for all things follow their kind.

The East is where things first sprout, their heads breaking through the soil, all growth sharp and piercing. Its essence resembles a spear, hence the spear. When the spirit-officials of the East arrive, they take this as their token.

The South is where the myriad things extend their branches and spread their leaves like halberds, so its essence holds a halberd. When the spirit-officials of the South arrive, they take this as their token.

The West is represented by the bow, crossbow, and axe. The West is the image of Heaven’s crossbow of killing. The bow, crossbow, and axe are the greatest instruments of harm. Thus, when its spirits arrive, they take these as their tokens.

The North is represented by the shield and sword. The North is where things hide and flee. The shield is for self-preservation, while the sword is wielded by petty men, often used to evade and harm others—it is not the possession of noble gentlemen. Thus, when its spirits arrive, they too take these as their tokens.

The Center is thunder, the drum, and the sword. The Center is Earth, the ruler of the Five Phases. The drum is the chief of the five weapons, and the sword is also borne by virtuous gentlemen—it too is the chief of the five weapons. Thus, when the spirits of the Center arrive, they take these as their tokens.

These are the true and natural credentials of Heaven and Earth. Just as a person must have a head, so too must they hold their proper token. Only with these genuine credentials may one respond to the spirits. Without them, one does not act as a true spirit. If one responds to other spirits falsely, all becomes disordered governance. Over time, such chaos is difficult to pacify, which is why all seek the true credentials.

Do you understand, Perfected One?"

"Yes, yes."

---

"This teaching appears shallow yet runs deep. Even those deemed unworthy of the Way nonetheless align with the qi of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases, resonating in harmony."

"Excellent! Excellent indeed!"

"Proceed, Perfected One—you have grasped it."

**Right: Methods to Suppress the Wicked and Transform All into the Dao to Save Lives**

**Comprehensive Collated Text of the *Classic of Great Peace*, Scrolls 73–85 (Wu Section, 5–17)**

**[Missing Title]**
To guard virtue, accumulate goodness, and thoroughly harmonize with the qi of Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, the people, crawling creatures, the myriad things, and the qi of the four seasons and Five Phases—ever in accord, none fail to recognize their goodness.

**[Missing Title]**
**First: Great Compassion and Filial Piety**
Compassion and filial piety arise from inner reflection, concealed yet flourishing, attained without study—this is the art of spontaneity. Conduct aligns with the heart of Heaven; intent merges with Earth. Above, it benefits the sovereign; below, it leads the people to prosperity, fostering harmonious qi and serving as the foremost model for all. Its practice is as vivid as cinnabar and ink, hence its primacy.

**Second: Illuminating Virtue and Great Gentleness**
To clarify the Dao and virtue, to lead the hundred clans, to study and love the Way, to amass goodness and virtue, to prevent theft and banditry—this most truly benefits the sovereign’s transformation. Most auspicious indeed!

**Third: Filial Piety and Fraternal Love as the Beginning of Learning Goodness**
Those who begin learning to do good harbor hope in their hearts, turning from depravity toward rectitude. Though their benevolent conduct has yet to transform others, they are on the path.

**Fourth: The Diligent Farmer’s Son**
The diligent son of the farming household rises at dawn and rests at dusk, sparing no toil. Day by day, he accumulates, fostering harmony at home to nourish his parents. He gains the earth’s bounty, follows Heaven’s Way, dares not transgress, and benefits the local authorities.

**Fifth: The Greatly Unbenevolent Son and the Righteousness-Lacking Youth Who Love Weapons and Gather Villains**
The unrighteous, the unbenevolent son—devoid of principle, they curse Heaven and strike Earth, neglect their parents, and wield weapons in all their deeds. They terrorize their villages, reckless youths who harm Heaven and Earth’s transformation, becoming grave threats. They must be captured through concerted effort, discarded into ditches, and denied burial.

**Sixth: The Household Lacking Harmony, Deceiving the Elderly and Favoring the Young, Sharing Meals but Hoarding Wealth**
A household bound for ruin—its kin at odds, unable to instruct one another, spreading reckless rumors, shirking and evading, turning from roots to frivolities. Such calamity admits no remedy.

**Seventh: Repenting Wrongs and Abandoning Weapons**
Born in destitution, seldom witnessing or hearing of goodness, ignorant of right and wrong, their conduct offends Heaven. Yet by the grace of a wise ruler, they are guided toward goodness. Unlearned in youth, they repent in maturity. Let the virtuous and worthy, with pillars five feet high, swiftly expel them from the ranks. Scholars must examine this: one day, all the people may become good.

**Eighth: Repenting Wrongs and Returning to Goodness**
Failing in their studies, calamity and chaos arise. Yet by the grace of a wise ruler, their circumstances are understood. Commanded to repent, they reverse course and become teachers of others.

**Ninth: The Greatly Wicked, Deceitful, and Greedy Who Corrupt Transformation**
Those who devour emoluments, wicked and rapacious, deceiving superiors and harming inferiors—great flatterers, thieves in official guise, human in form but beastly in nature. They benefit neither Heaven nor Earth, yin nor yang. Their deep disasters warrant execution and annihilation.

**Tenth: Correcting Wrongs, Restoring Rectitude, and Repenting Deeds**
To repent wrongs, reform conduct, and renew the heart—though goodness was absent in youth and disasters frequently arose, morning’s errors are amended by evening. Such a one is called a good person.

These ten ranks are the methods of ancient sages and worthies, delighting in others’ goodness and preventing mutual harm. They ensure each completes their Heaven-appointed years, returns to the Dao, severs the roots of corruption, and beholds the qi of Great Peace.

**[Missing Title]**

The divine all operate through rectitude, their root being the Supreme Correlation. The Supreme Correlation is bound to the emperor, through whom the celestial movements are rectified. Next, its root is bound to the empress, through whom the terrestrial principles are harmonized. The middle root is bound to the multitude of sages, through whom yin and yang are ordered. The subtle and minor roots are bound to the common people, through whom the myriad things are governed. The great person who acts accordingly attains greatness; the middling person, middling results; the petty person, small gains—yet all may achieve rectitude.

When the emperor practices virtue and power, the sun shines with great brilliance; with little virtue, little brilliance. When the empress practices virtue and power, the moon radiates great light; with little virtue, little light. When the multitude of worthies practice virtue and power, the stars and celestial cycles blaze with great splendor; with little virtue, little splendor. When all four roots practice virtue and power together, the world is at peace, auspicious signs emerge, and great light extends afar. Gazing from afar at the celestial signs, wind and rain arrive in due season, the barbarians submit in sincerity, and disasters naturally dissipate.

Now, having received the Celestial Master’s writings on the Dao and virtue, they are entrusted to the reverent people, that the reverent may return to the Way. Above, there is a sovereign of great benevolence and virtue, who can govern the world in peace and secure the body for long tranquility. The emperor is the first noble son of the August Heaven above; the empress is the first noble daughter of the Earth below. These most divine and sagely noble persons, whose office should reside within the hundredfold ranks, instead bear the cares of the world beyond ten thousand *li*, receiving the celestial mandate to uphold the unity of yin and yang, the six directions, and the eight quarters. In the exalted positions of Heaven and Earth, they are entrusted by the divine spirits, and all beings—from the highest to the crawling creatures—submit in sincerity.

Thus, they compose the *Wushang Lingbao Petition*, able to comprehend the will of Heaven and illuminate the officers of the celestial cycles, known as the Grand Scribe. Their duties brook no evasion: day and night, they alternately observe and report the waxing and waning of celestial *qi*, the gains and losses of the Three Luminaries, delighting in receiving Heaven’s admonitions to secure their own peace. In the eleventh month, they cultivate the Yellow Bell, guiding the *qi* from below the earth to ascend and communicate, delighting in harmonizing with the intent of the Earth Queen to secure their own peace.

They construct the Hall of Light in the *bingwu* position of Great Yang, opening eight windows to allow passage in four directions, delighting in the circulation of the *qi* of the eight directions and four seasons, seeking to align with the auspicious *qi* of the eight winds and four seasons to secure their own peace. They open the four gates, delighting in receiving the world’s rare texts, extraordinary strategies, seldom-seen treasures, worthy and enlightened arts, and unusual techniques that can secure the world’s long peace and dispel calamities and anomalies.

In ancient times, when sages held office, they constantly sought reclusive worthies of gentle virtue to share in governance. It is desired to hear of the four seasons’ honored positions, yet the kingly *qi* is the chief of the insubstantial *qi*, to which all other *qi* are bound, the lord of all honored sovereigns. The kingly *qi* is Heaven, the August One, the Emperor, the King, the Grand Year, the Monthly Establishment, the Dipper’s Ridge, the Azure Dragon, Great Virtue, Prosperous Flourishing, the Emperor-King, the Supreme King, the Lord of Generation and Completion.

Thus, wherever the kingly *qi* resides, the myriad things submit to its rule; where it dwells, all things thrive and grow; where it turns away, all perish—this is the work of the primordial *qi*. Therefore, when the kingly *qi* resides in yang, yang prevails; when in yin, yin prevails; when in Heaven, Heaven rules; when on Earth, Earth rules. Wherever it resides, that place is governed and receives the mandate to order. Thus, the ancient sage-kings faced east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn, north in winter, and the center in the sixth month, completing the cycle of *qi* to present themselves before Heaven—then the kingly *qi* is honored above all.

When the Monthly Establishment is named "Great Expenditure and Ruin," and the kingly *qi* is opposed, it is called "Death and Annihilation." The primordial *qi* establishes the position, and the kingly *qi* is the first of all *qi*, majestic and not to be rashly confronted. The position after the Monthly Establishment is called "Closure," for Heaven seals what follows, lest the retiring yin *qi* advance deceitfully to disrupt the kingly *qi* of the Monthly Establishment—thus, it is closed off. "Opening" is Heaven’s principle, which delights not in harm or injury. Thus, to open what follows is to instruct the retiring *qi*, for those who act deceitfully delight in being allowed to retreat. If they do not retreat, they will be seized; upon seizure, they are interrogated and found guilty, and their guilt cannot be absolved, leading to perilous death. Thus, the fifth position after is "Peril," which approaches death. The sixth position after is "Destruction," where the Dipper’s destruction brings death—thus, the Chief of the Dipper presides over death, leading to peril.

Therefore, the kingly *qi* arises from Lesser Yang, and Greater Yang constantly guards the Dipper’s Establishment. The *qi* of death arises from Lesser Yin, and Greater Yin constantly guards the Dipper’s Chief. Thus, the sixth position after is where Heaven regularly retires and empties, aligning with Earth’s *qi*, presiding over closure and concealment. There, treacherous rebels and evil spirits dwell together, and it must not be rashly opened. The ancients, who cherished life, placed all *qi* before the Dipper, aligning with the celestial movements—thus, the day is auspicious and possesses *qi*. All who act deceitfully, treacherously, as yin thieves, or with evil and perversity resemble yin *qi* and belong to the Dipper’s rear—thus, the day is in decline, and their actions are inauspicious.

The primordial *qi* is indistinct and nebulous, naturally coalescing into one, called Heaven. Dividing to generate yin, it forms Earth, called the second. Thus, above is Heaven and below is Earth; yin and yang unite to generate humanity, called the third. The Three Powers together generate and nurture all things, called wealth. Wealth generates desire; desire generates perversity; perversity generates deceit; deceit generates treachery; treachery generates harm. If harm is unchecked, disorder and ruin follow; if ruin is unchecked, it cannot be governed again, and thus returns to its root in exhaustion—this is called "inherited burden."

The Dao of Heaven is without intent: when it encounters the unworthy, disorder arises; when it obtains the worthy and enlightened, order is restored. In ancient times, when emperors obtained worthy and enlightened ministers, the Dao flourished. They dared not employ the foolish and unworthy as close advisors. Swiftly transmit this text to a sovereign of superior virtue to practice it. The penetratingly enlightened shine brightly. When the Three Powers mutually manifest and inquire, their divination is ten for ten, and all they govern is well-ordered—this is the foremost clarity, fit to serve as the emperor’s agent.

Those whose divination is nine in ten—with one qi in disorder and ungoverned—may serve as agents for the feudal lords. Those whose divination is eight in ten—with two qi in disorder and ungoverned—may serve as agents for common people. Beyond this, it is called "disordering Heaven’s correct Dao," and grievances must accumulate. Ghosts and spirits conceal themselves and flee, becoming unseen; it cannot be governed, nor can the qi of Great Peace be harmonized.

If you seek the Dao, ponder the written texts. The method of seeking the Dao takes stillness as its root. As the root, accumulating essence without cease is the gateway to spirit. When the Five Virtues harmonize and unite, the hun and po become visible; the heart-spirit is already luminous, and the Great Dao unfolds. First, know safety and peril, observe the four neighbors, and the host of spirits will gather like clouds. If this is unceasing, you shall be a long-lived lord.

Ah! The Great Dao does not require toil. Let the form be like dead ashes, guarding the hun-spirit. If the hun-spirit does not depart, you shall long endure. The cyclic returns to its beginning, an endless loop. To abandon the root and seek the branches brings affliction to the Dao. The multitude, having lost it, cannot be whole. Ponder its meaning, do not lose the true words. Stillness is the root, not the expenditure of wealth. Can you not deeply cherish the words of the enlightened teacher? Follow the teacher’s instructions, and you shall not die.

The foolish, opposing the teacher, dwell near ghosts. They do not attain the correct Dao but enter the gate of misfortune, never to return to spirit. Their bones and flesh rot in the earth, called ancestors, their lives already extinguished in great exhaustion.

**Untitled Section**
The arts of the common and foolish all emerge from within. They possess their own laws, with profundity as their root. When they perceive spirit, they live, free from suffering and sorrow. Spirit detests strenuous exertion; calm the heart and settle the mind. Beware of sudden violence. With prolonged stillness, the myriad Dao all emerge. Long abiding without death, you shall unite with Heaven. In practice, harmony is essential, becoming one with the Dao. The worthy hold fast without wavering, and all matters are complete. Worldly thoughts are cast aside, and you commune with spirit. Riding clouds and driving dragons, you share a chamber with the Thunder Duke. The body transforms into spirit, its form like the Great One.

Ponder deeply the words of this text; be careful not to lose proper measure.

**The Dao of Profound Reflection**
The Dao of profound reflection is perfected in seclusion. Do not seek honor or rank; let your resolve grow daily more refined. Open the obscured to reveal clarity, like the brightness of day. When not learning, it is as if gazing into blackest lacquer—east, west, south, north—lost within your chamber. The worthy and sagely are alarmed, the heart alone trembles in fear.

If the Five Guardians are strong, you shall not die. Content with poverty and delighting in lowliness, you may endure long. To scorn lowliness and seek nobility obstructs the Dao. Covet no exalted office or heavy emolument. To forcibly seek official rank is to lose the Dao—better to lie abed in long repose. Without eating, you become luminous; the hundred evils all depart, and calamity is far removed. Guard stillness without cease, and you shall not perish. Fortunate is the one who may live long and endure, never daring to indulge the will and lose constancy.

Seek without cease, and you shall be a king of the Dao. The arts of governance and life differ in method; they do not obstruct the people’s distinct affairs. When superiors cherish life, the people’s lives are long. The worldly teachings place the Dao above, and there are benevolent kings. The sagely ruler ponders the Dao, and its transformative influence flows downward, making the people pure and incorrupt. Forever free from calamity, the people do not die—this is the clarity of the superior.

When the superior lacks a luminous ruler, teachings do not spread. Unwilling to practice the Dao, they instead favor warfare. Every household has a wicked son, and families perish. Wielding weapons, they waylay travelers by the roadside, waiting for an opening to seize their belongings. The magistrates are not at peace, and bandits roam. Observe the people, and the superior may be known as luminous. When the ruler cherishes benevolence, the people below seek long life.

When the superior is not benevolent, the people below incline toward wickedness, all meeting early deaths, knowing no joy in life. When the people below cherish virtue, it is the teaching of the superior. When the people love the Dao, their lord is luminous. To desire long life wholly is to distance calamity. To not eat yet remain incorrupt is to cast aside all weapons. To sit in tranquil nonaction is to discard misfortune. When the sagely ruler greatly flourishes, the people cherish one another. When kindness extends even to the foolish below, this is the true king. The Dao of Heaven cherishes life to secure the superior. When the foolish below do not contend for the superior’s blessings, the world is most fortunate, and all turn toward the king.

When the people do not love the Dao, it is because the superior is not luminous. Harboring treacherous hearts, they feign upright conduct. Not cherishing virtue, they instead favor warfare. Fathers and sons are separated, dwelling by the roadside. They do not attain long life, accumulating only death and loss. Households have impoverished sons, like tigers and wolves. When the superior lacks virtue, it brings the calamity of war. When the foolish rule below, transformative influence does not spread. When the people greatly love immortality, the emperor is luminous. Heaven sees their governance, and kindness flows downward. Creeping things and panting creatures all bask in its light.

Heaven cherishes the Dao of life, thus it is the Heavenly Canon. Those who accumulate virtue become the Earthly Canon. Earth cherishes nurturance, thus it is the Earthly Canon. Those who accumulate harmony and cherish giving become the Human Canon. Harmonious qi mutually communicate and interact. People possess wealth and interact, giving and receiving—thus harmony is the Human Canon.

In ancient times, those who would study and inquire all rectified their roots. It is like planting a tree: seek a good seed and place it in good soil, and its growth—root, trunk, branches, and leaves—shall all be good. The root is the original teacher; the branches and fruit are the disciples. Thus, in ancient learning, all first pondered and reflected upon the root before studying the Dao. Therefore, those who can practice this align with Heaven’s heart, and thus it is auspicious.

If one plants a tree without selecting a good one and places it in poor soil, how can its branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit be beautiful? This is like first aligning the body, rectifying the nature and the Dao of the mind, ultimately returning to primordial qi to settle the body. Reflect upon the ancient methods, the duties practiced by former teachers—how can one govern oneself? Plan and settle the mind to the utmost, and you shall attain it yourself.

First, settle the form, then begin practice, like an infant at play, not employing sinew or strength, but only good intention. Ponder deeply how the ancients alone attained longevity, how their governance relied solely on intention—how did they achieve this? Only through the utmost Dao, restraining wickedness and eliminating treachery. It is like a spirit, without strange anomalies. When the root is rectified, this is how it is practiced. Thus, one aligns with Heaven’s heart, does not betray Earth’s intention, completes the four seasons, harmonizes the Five Phases, and descendants do not inherit burdens. Each cherishes the utmost virtue, no longer knowing wickedness or evil.

The Perfected One of [Preserving] Authenticity asked: "What is the Heavenly Canon? What is the Earthly Canon? What is the Human Canon? What is the Dao Canon? What is the Sagely Canon? What is the Worthy Canon? What is the Auspicious Canon? What is the Inauspicious Canon? What is the Canon of Life? What is the Canon of Death?"

The Divine Person replied: "Cultivating and accumulating the true Dao—this is the Heavenly Canon. Heaven cherishes life, and the Dao likewise cherishes life; thus it is the Heavenly Canon. Cultivating and accumulating virtue—this is the Earthly Canon. Earth cherishes nurturance, and virtue likewise cherishes nurturance; thus it is the Earthly Canon. Cultivating harmony and delighting in bestowal—this is the Human Canon. Harmonious qi flows and intermingles; when people possess wealth, it too should circulate and intermingle; thus harmony is the Human Canon.

"Accumulating the teachings of the Dao from the High, Middle, and Lower Antiquities—this is the Dao Canon. Accumulating the sagely writings of the High, Middle, and Lower Antiquities—this is the Sagely Canon. Accumulating the worthy discourses of the High, Middle, and Lower Antiquities—this is the Worthy Canon. That which follows an auspicious teacher is the Auspicious Canon; that which follows an inauspicious teacher is the Inauspicious Canon; that which follows a teacher of life is the Canon of Life; that which follows a teacher of death is the Canon of Death.

"The dharma is made manifest by sages; the Dao is entrusted to humans for its flourishing." *Essentials of Cultivation: Excerpts from Precepts and Rituals, Scroll One*

**Untitled**

To enter a chamber and dwell alone, contemplating the roots of the scriptures and the Dao—what one requires in going out and coming in—is first grasped in meaning by the worthy, and those who follow after will likewise enter the Dao, far removed from the perverse.

Entering the chamber to meditate and preserve, the five officials shift and transform, aligning with the yin and yang of the three months as brothers, moving in accord with qi, and following the changes of the four seasons and five phases as the constant Way of Heaven. To lose qi is to die; to possess qi is to live. The myriad things follow this, and the human Dao stands supreme.

Thus the five officials are established, rising with qi, and the Way of Heaven soars as the supreme qi. The Perfected accumulate qi and gather spirit and illumination, so the Dao ultimately travels alone, while the common people, losing qi, perish.

The dead are base; the living are noble. The child who guards the Dao may endure long; to follow qi is to transform. Heaven is constant, free from haste for fame or profit—the Dao moves of itself.

The Way of Heaven constantly gives life without loss; the Way of Earth sustains both yet presides over death. The sages and worthies of high antiquity served in office; the middling scholars retired to the mountains; the lesser scholars, like insects, died among the people.

The worthy, upon seeing these words, ponder them deeply. First difficult, then easy, they bring no harm to the body. Guarding virtue, they complete the great Dao, and through study, having passed through the nine chambers, become spirit-people. Their thoughts are ever distinct from those of ordinary folk, never from dawn to dusk contemplating earthly matters, but desiring to hear the affairs of Heaven. Only when their minds dwell on the duties of Heaven may they descend through the nine chambers.

Accumulating essence with utmost sincerity, they transform of themselves, altering their form and appearance, becoming the sages of Heaven above, no longer able to attend to the affairs of the world below—this is clear.

My writings enable the lofty scholar to live on unseen, while the lesser scholar dares not act or speak recklessly. My writings serve the Dao, exhausting human aspirations, enabling the worthy and unworthy alike to fulfill their talents, so that even at death there is no regret—each has fulfilled their Heavenly mandate.

Those who desire long life and lasting joy should ponder the true meaning of the Dao and proceed; those who do not desire lasting life should attend to worldly affairs, content merely to preserve themselves.

**Untitled**

To examine one’s conduct is to mirror the body, knowing for oneself the methods of gain and loss. The wise and enlightened encompass Heaven and Earth, accumulating boundless writings, yet cannot extend their own lives—this is called emptiness, devoid of true Dao.

The masters of arts and techniques, though long in study, ultimately confine themselves. They may master the patterns of Heaven and Earth, fully comprehend the nature of the myriad things, and amass all manner of texts, yet if they cannot serve their parents or honor their lord, such knowledge is of no benefit.

Pondering these words, good and ill fortune become clear. Practicing this in simplicity enables one to know gain and loss for oneself.

**Untitled**

What in learning is most urgent? Thus I set forth two matters, clearly distinguishing the signs of a scholar’s loss and gain.

Since the beginning of creation, there have been two urgent concerns; the rest may be known or unknown as one wishes. What Heaven and Earth and the sagely and enlightened attend to—what must be practiced to achieve great gain—are longevity and filial piety.

Longevity shares Heaven and Earth’s concern; filial piety shares their power. Thus longevity is long life, aligning with Heaven’s essence. Filial piety is to submit below and follow above, harmonizing with Earth’s voice. These two matters accord with the intent of Heaven and Earth, and misfortune naturally departs.

Pondering this deeply is the principle of Great Peace and the essence of long life. Yet few who desire goodness seek to live thus.

Parents are the root of life; the lord is the gate of honor and esteem; the teacher is the source of wisdom and the inexhaustible vocation. These three are the gateways of virtue and power.

Parents transmit the ancestral lineage of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang; the teacher clarifies the intent of Heaven and Earth and resolves the knots of worldly affairs; the lord upholds Heaven and Earth, follows yin and yang, constantly striving to grasp their intent, and takes ordering the Dao as his duty. Thus these three are the gateways of nature and destiny.

Pondering these words deeply, all harm is dispelled. Longevity and filial piety are beloved by spirits and numina; those who lack them attract a hundred calamities. This Dao is natural, requiring no effort. To know its efficacy, observe how it follows human intentions, good or ill.

The heart’s intentions devise matters within, and echoes respond without. To know this Dao is to understand the correspondence of reflection and echo. The heart and intention are the gateways of good and ill fortune.

The rulers of Great Peace in antiquity governed by focusing their hearts and intentions on goodness, and their ministers were likewise good; if their intentions were misguided, their ministers followed suit. Heart and intention are the pivot of Heaven and Earth—do not move them recklessly, lest harmonious qi be disrupted and disasters arise daily.

*Great Peace Scripture: Collated Edition, Scroll Eighty-Six, Ji Section One*
*Great Peace Scripture, Scroll Eighty-Six*

Six Perfected Ones of the Six Directions respectfully bow again, stating: "Previously, we received the Celestial Master’s instruction to compile and submit a joint memorial under strict orders. Returning to our respective posts, we focused our thoughts and pondered its meaning for seven days and seven nights. The Six Perfected Ones convened thrice to deliberate, yet all remained perplexed.

Regarding the three revelatory discussions: we witnessed three celestial omens of streaming stars and shifting light.
First, we saw a streaming star emerge from the Gate of Heaven and enter the Portal of Earth.
Second, we saw a streaming star depart from the Great Yang and enter the Great Yin.
Third, we saw the constellations stream into the Celestial Prison.

Considering these three together, we feared that the Celestial Master’s Three Dao Missives might be severed below, preventing their ascent, thereby provoking the Celestial Wrath to deepen in fury, and the Primordial Qi of the Supreme Sovereign to fail in its descent. This would cause the virtuous rulers of emperors and kings to perpetually inherit the lingering disasters of former kings, plunging them into sorrow and hardship."

"Alas! The Six Perfected Ones have come together on behalf of the August Spirit to inquire—how diligent you are in advancing the Celestial Way! I have heard the words of many disciples, yet none surpass those of the Perfected Ones. Now, try to explain the meaning of these streaming stars yourselves."

"The six disciples, dull and benighted, dare not withhold our words. First, a streaming star emerged from the Gate of Heaven and entered the Portal of Earth. The Gate of Heaven is yang, the ruler; the Portal of Earth is yin, the subjects and ministers. Now, the conduct of subjects and ministers does not flow upward in allegiance; instead, the ruler descends to bestow favor below. The gate and portal are meant to facilitate communication—yet now, the lower portal does not ascend, while the upper gate opens downward. This signifies that the lower realm’s petitions are severed, unable to ascend."

"Excellent are the words of the Perfected One—I have nothing to add. Though the task is arduous, proceed to explain the next two omens."

"Yes, yes. The second omen: we observed the Great Yang star streaming into the midst of the Great Yin. The Great Yang is the ruler; the Great Yin, the subjects and ministers. The Great Yang is brightness; the Great Yin, darkness and obscurity. Now, darkness and obscurity ought to flow upward into the midst of great brightness—this is like subjects and ministers, benighted and ignorant, beset by hardship, who ought to ascend and attach themselves to a luminous king and sagely lord, seeking to have their grievances redressed. Yet now, the great brightness descends into the midst of darkness and obscurity. This symbolizes that imperial edicts bestowing favor, descending to the lower realm, are severed and cut off. The darkness and obscurity remain unilluminated; the governance below is in solitary chaos, obscuring and concealing what lies above. It further resembles those among the common people below, whose local officials jointly conceal the portents of Heaven and Earth, preventing them from ascending and communicating in the unseen. Together with the subjects and ministers, they deceive their superior, serving as evidence of their collusion in wrongdoing."

"Excellent, excellent! I have nothing to add to the words of the six disciples. Though the task is arduous, proceed to explain the third omen."

"Yes, yes. The third omen: we observed the constellations streaming into the Celestial Prison. The constellations are stars of goodness and rectitude, yet they stream into the prison of Heaven. The prison is where Heaven metes out punishment and judgment. I fear that the virtuous and upright, wishing to serve the Emperor and expend their efforts, submit memorials to communicate the discourse of Heaven and Earth—yet they are instead resented and despised by local officials in distant regions far from the capital. Later, these officials harm them on other pretexts, and so the constellations stream into the prison.""

"Excellent and precise! I have nothing to add to the words of the six disciples."

"Now, why is it that the six of you ask these matters with such indignation? Do you alone never grow weary or slacken?"

"We dare not. We have always heard the Celestial Master say that when perfected ones come from Heaven to inquire, if we were to cease, we fear the words of Heaven would not be conveyed. Now, the lives of all people belong to Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth are displeased, they will instead bring harm to people, and we would not fulfill our allotted heavenly years of longevity."

"Excellent! The words of the perfected ones are correct and without error. Now, I shall speak to all the perfected ones—I dare not omit, slacken, or cease. I and all the perfected ones alike—our lives belong to Heaven and Earth. If we were to close off and not speak, or speak and then cease midway, Heaven and Earth would together bring harm to me. Thus, I too dare not recklessly stop in my discourse. Proceed, and I shall explain in full for the six perfected ones. Now, the six perfected ones have newly emerged from the cavern, thinking of Heaven, so that they may remove Heaven’s afflictions; thinking of virtuous rulers, so that they may resolve calamities and secure their persons. The six perfected ones must together fully express their intent, exhausting all that they wish to say, so that nothing is cut off or obstructed."

"Yes, yes. We dare not fail to exhaust even the wisdom of sparrows and mice—shall we not speak all?"

"Most gratified."

"Yes, yes."

〈Rising〉 Now, what the world fears most is the sealing of mouths, lest they dare speak recklessly. Even the sun, moon, and stars—those celestial spirits in the heavens’ ranks—stand in mutual awe. Thus, when the sun rises, the stars flee and hide, not daring to appear before its majesty. Within the four borders, where a stern emperor reigns, the world trembles in fear. Though some dwell far from the capital, they dare not speak when imperial decrees arrive. If a province has a powerful governor, the entire province dares not speak. If a commandery has a strong magistrate, the whole commandery dares not speak. If a county has a harsh magistrate, the entire county dares not speak. Even if a single ward has a stern ward chief, the whole ward dares not speak. This ward chief is but the lowest of officials—how much more so for those who serve him? All fear harm and seek only to avoid it, suppressing even good intentions, unable to convey them upward. Thus, the Dao is cut off and obstructed here.

Now, if but a single village has a strong-willed man who holds sway, the whole village dares not speak, fearing later resentment and harm. Even within a single household, if a fierce and domineering man holds power, the whole family dares not speak. 〈Rising〉 Even within a family—those bound by blood and kin, born of the same kind—such mutual aversion and fear exist. How much more so between different generations? Since the Highest Antiquity and Middle Antiquity, the Dao and virtue have been largely lost, replaced by governance through might and force. Coercion and oppression prevail; those who do not obey later suffer grave harm, wounds so deep they afflict descendants. Thus, though the people witness celestial portents and strange calamities, they dare not speak rashly, fearing those in authority near them. This silence accumulates over time, each generation bearing the burden of the last. By the Lesser Antiquity, the situation has grown even worse. If one wishes to submit a memorial to the emperor, those who control his fate kill him at once. Even if not harmed immediately, they later conspire to injure him through connections. Thus, ministers and commoners all seal their tongues and shut their mouths, living in darkness. Though they see suffering and injustice, witness evil, they dare not report it upward. Though emperors today are said to be of unmatched wisdom, celestial omens multiply daily—clear proof of this.

Now, the people are born of their parents and receive their lives from Heaven and Earth. Taking Heaven and Earth as their parents, when they see disasters or auspicious signs, it is as if Heaven and Earth are speaking, wishing to convey these words. Yet all are terrified, fearing harm from those to whom they are bound, and dare not speak or reveal the truth. They admonish one another, turning their backs on Heaven and Earth, cutting off communication, and blocking the words Heaven and Earth wish to convey. They conceal the grievances of Heaven and Earth, preventing their words from reaching above, leaving Heaven and Earth long resentful and unheard.

Though an emperor may be divine and sagely, he is but one man, surrounded by layer upon layer of others, far from the edges of his realm. Even if those within the layers wish to convey words to him, they are coerced by those near them and cannot reach him. 〈Ceasing〉 Though an emperor may possess the benevolence and wisdom of ten thousand men, each person is constrained by fear. Heaven and Earth, the most sacred of all, are merely gazed upon from afar or observed nearby, yet even they can only resolve matters before them. How can an emperor be more divine and sagely than Heaven and Earth?

We six fools once encountered a fierce tiger in a distant wilderness. All six of us froze, not daring to move our feet, speak, turn our heads, or even blink our eyes. Such is the fear and coercion that constrain people.

"Excellent, excellent! Now, hearing the six perfected ones speak, I understand that Heaven alone has long suffered grievous injustice, its words unable to reach above. Though it creates myriad strange signs as messages, these are blocked below and cannot ascend, leaving it long pent-up and resentful. Thus, I exhort the perfected ones, instructing them earnestly in the matter of this scripture. Therefore, the perfected ones are vigilant and diligent—this is Heaven’s will."

"Yes, yes."

"I fear Heaven’s majesty and shall now ponder the essential meaning for you. What is the most pressing matter the six perfected ones ask about?"

"We six fools have pondered this scripture for seven days and nights, convening three times to discuss it. Thrice we saw meteors, taking them as Heaven’s admonition and instruction, urging us to inquire. We six all ingest qi, yet it does not descend smoothly, rising instead in rebellion. At that time, our ears and eyes grew dizzy and dim, and we were all astonished, deliberating together. We knew not what great terror this was—only the Heavenly Master can explain it to us."

"Excellent! The ancient changes have revealed their full meaning to the perfected ones. From your words, I now understand: the three scriptures of the Dao will again face obstruction and severance—why is this?"

"I wish to hear the decisive meaning."

"Very well. The nine orifices correspond to the divisions of the nine provinces. Now, the perfected ones say that when they ingest qi, it does not flow smoothly, and their vision grows dim without light. This is because the nine provinces, great and small, oppress one another, preventing urgent words from reaching above. Qi is that by which the lives of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are connected. Heaven and Earth use qi and wind to transform the lives of the myriad things. That qi does not flow smoothly is clear proof that the Dao of Heaven is obstructed and cannot reach through. Heaven wishes the perfected ones to attend earnestly to this matter, thus stirring and moving them with qi. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Excellent, you have understood."

"Understood."

"Heaven has instructed the Six Perfected Ones to teach me to speak fully of this! Let the Six of you sit at ease, and I shall explain the Way to all your disciples. For those who fear the officials of their prefectures and dare not speak: let all the good and wise scholars within a prefecture gather together and jointly deliberate, then submit their case to another prefecture. If they fear their commandery, let them deliberate and submit to another commandery. If they fear their county, let them deliberate and submit to another county. If they fear their township, let them deliberate and submit to another township. If they fear their village, let them deliberate and submit to another village. All shall be accommodated in their respective locales. Those who prohibit or intimidate others from doing so shall be punished according to the severity of the transgressions and omens they suppress, with an additional degree added to their original offense."

"Why is the penalty so severe?"

"It should not be considered severe—one might even fear it is too lenient. Now, Heaven and Earth cherish virtuous emperors and wish to fully inform them. Yet men, born of Heaven and Earth, turn their backs on Heaven and Earth, severing the celestial discourse, causing Heaven to fall ill. This accumulated obstruction remains unresolved, their grievances unexpressed, their words unanswered—this is a grave act of rebellion, a most grievous offense. As for the people and ministers, they are the envoys and limbs of the emperor. They ought to clarify the sovereign’s understanding, ensuring that those above may rest without worry, aligning with the will of Heaven. When Heaven rejoices, the sovereign’s years are prolonged. Yet now, those below act disloyally, turning their backs on Heaven and Earth, blocking the emperor’s wisdom, causing him distress and self-reproach for governance gone awry. Disasters and omens multiply, peril and unease abound—all this amounts to great disloyalty, unfiliality, and treachery, crimes that by law should not be pardoned. How can such penalties be deemed excessive?

When the celestial discourse is obstructed, Heaven and Earth grow enraged, harming all living things, as though seeking to destroy Heaven and Earth—such is a year of utmost calamity. A state deprived of wisdom is a state in grave peril. This crime defies description; thus, it is deemed a capital offense."

"Perfected Ones, do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Excellent, you have understood. The reason I dare not... is that seeing the Six of you come to inquire, I recognize you as Heaven’s envoys. How could the Perfected Ones dare not...? Do you understand?"

"Yes."

"Yes, yes."

"Now, the reason for not [concealing] such names is to avoid misleading the sovereign. When the virtuous ruler sees the documents, he commands that those who submit memorials—especially those with great [merit]—be rewarded with virtue and gifts. In this way, none under Heaven will fail to rejoice, delighting in exhausting their strength to jointly submit memorials and present matters. No longer will there be only a solitary voice speaking; all must gather to deliberate. If a single person speaks, it may be false, flattering, or deceptive, leading the sovereign to lose grasp of reality. Such grave errors must not be heeded.

In recent years, those who have submitted memorials have repeatedly proven trustworthy, including those with great merit. Yet the number of superior gentlemen who gather remains lamentably few—only two or three assembling. Why is this so? Precisely because when few gather, deceit and falsehood abound. How could there be no deceit?

"I wish to hear more."

"Indeed, when many gather, those submitting memorials naturally restrain one another, fearing leaks, exposure of strengths and weaknesses, or being turned into tools of deception against the sovereign. Only when matters are thoroughly verified [and confirmed] do they dare speak; without [verification], they dare not. Moreover, they dare not conceal anything, ever wary of future consequences. Thus, all is trustworthy.

Consider a village of a hundred households colluding in deceit: among men, women, children, and elders, there will always be someone who leaks the truth, and neighboring villages will come to know of it. The wise and cautious in that village will not dare conceal it, fearing implication in the affair. How much less so for a prefecture, commandery, county, township, or post station? If a commandery harbors extraordinary matters, how could they remain hidden? They will inevitably be exposed by others, and thus all good and evil will come to light. Heaven will rejoice greatly, disasters will vanish, and the flow will be as unimpeded as running water. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

Moreover, when great assemblies deliberate, none dare deceive, for if one or two attempt deceit, the others will not follow. Should anyone seek to deceive or act in bad faith, the multitude will immediately record and report it. Such is the law for those who betray Heaven and Earth, deceive the sovereign, or commit great treason and impiety. Heaven resents them, and people despise them; their crimes admit no pardon. Do you, Perfected One, understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Good. You have now awakened. Having submitted your memorial, return home, but beware of those who resent your actions. Should anyone submit a memorial seeking to harm you, their name will be inscribed on the left as a 'Memorial of Resentment,' and their offenses will not be absolved. Thus, the three channels for memorials will remain open, and none will dare obstruct them. In this way, Heaven and Earth will be pleased, the disasters of karmic inheritance borne by the sovereign will be largely dispelled, and the world will attain Great Peace. The primordial qi of the Highest August will fully descend, aiding the virtuous ruler in governance, and... will not fail the Six Perfected Ones."

"Yes, yes."

"Good. The essence of the Six Perfected Ones has greatly advanced, removing illness from Heaven and dispelling calamities for the sovereign. Their merit is already manifest in Heaven, and the king’s rule grows daily stronger and clearer. The Six Perfected Ones have fulfilled their measure of goodness; they should strive diligently and be ever cautious!"

"Yes, yes. I humbly ask one great secret: may the Celestial Master reveal whether the memorials’ circulation fully harmonizes with the divine spirits? May I hear of this?"

"Indeed, there are great proofs—Heaven’s Dao does not deceive."

"Each seeks its kind, and the virtuous ruler should frequently dispatch trusted officials to inquire among the people: how many suffer from ulcers, pestilence, or scabies? If the memorials’ circulation has not fully harmonized with the divine spirits, there will be an excess of worms devouring people—worms that feed on humans are themselves the cure for humans. Indeed, those below who lack virtue and power among the subjects are like worms, turning to feed upon the people. This is the effect of worms governing humans. Where there are no ulcers, pestilence, or scabies, it is because all in office are good people, and no worms remain. In this, not one in ten thousand will fail."

"Excellent! Excellent! Is this the only proof? Are there others?"

"All calamities and anomalies under Heaven arise in response to governance, each with its own cause. Simply reflect deeply on the matter, and you will understand—why single out ulcers, pestilence, or scabies? Other disasters are merely seen in the myriad things, but worms turning to devour humans is the most severe, so I use it as proof."

"Excellent! Excellent! Had I not earnestly questioned the Celestial Master, there would be no way to know this."

"Now that the Perfected Ones have spoken, I already understand—this was merely a show of humility."

"Far from it, far from it. We six foolish students, having received the Celestial Master’s solemn instruction, shall each return to our residences and dwell in quietude, pondering only the essential meaning. Yet the Celestial Master’s writings demand that all, from the great to the small, down to servants and slaves, gather to deliberate and jointly memorialize the Dao regarding calamities, anomalies, good, and evil—is this not overly burdensome?"

The other student wished to hear his intent.

"Excellent! You six were chosen to inquire of Heaven’s affairs—how carefully you must attend to the words of the Perfected Ones! The reason for including even commoners, servants, and slaves is this: within the present bounds of Heaven’s domain, conditions vary across ten thousand *li*; at five thousand *li*, they differ slightly. Across a thousand *li*, winds and *qi* shift; at five hundred *li*, they vary again in small measure. Within a hundred *li*, yin and rain diverge; at fifty *li*, the difference is subtle. Even within a single county, transformations, calamities, strange omens, good, and evil are not uniform.

Now, when the August Heaven manifests calamities, anomalies, or transformations, they do not always appear in the imperial palace, the halls of local officials, or before high ministers. Rather, such signs are often first seen in the wilderness and among the common folk, where the lowly and base perceive them earliest. Yet each conceals them for fear of their superiors, and officials, in turn, conceal them for fear of their lords, collectively severing the discourse between Heaven and Earth. Each seeks to flatter their superiors, desiring their names to be praised and their achievements swiftly promoted, and so they collude in wrongdoing, suppressing Heaven and Earth’s calamities, anomalies, and strange omens, blocking them from reaching the emperor’s ears. Thus, the emperor, cut off without cause, deprived of wisdom, fails to grasp the intent of Heaven and Earth. His governance grows perilous and chaotic, difficult to stabilize, and he is left with sorrow and hardship.

The emperor is born by the mandate of Heaven, with Heaven as his father and Earth as his mother. As the Son of Heaven, when the people and ministers together act without the Dao, severing the discourse of his parents and preventing it from reaching their child, is there any greater crime? To jointly obstruct the discourse of Heaven and Earth, to deceive one’s superior, to be unfaithful and untrustworthy as a minister to the people—how could such offenses be named lightly? Do you now perceive this?"

"Yes, yes."

Moreover, all people, ministers, servants, and slaves are born of Heaven, nurtured by Earth, and governed and sustained by the emperor. These three matters constitute their very lives—without them, there would be no means to be born, to grow, or to nourish and order themselves. Yet they all conspire to deceive their superior, collectively ignorant of Heaven and Earth, leaving the emperor bereft of wisdom and cut off. Their crimes warrant ten thousand deaths, and even then, their guilt would not be exhausted—how grave is this?

"Perfected One, why do you remain so dull and uncomprehending? People are born of Heaven and nurtured by Earth. When Heaven and Earth suffer distress and illness, they manifest strange omens to inform their child, desiring to see order restored. Yet the foolish people jointly sever the discourse of Heaven, incurring the great wrath of Heaven and Earth. The emperor is the father and mother of the people and ministers, yet they conspire to deceive their parents, causing them constant sorrow and hardship, unable to bring peace to their governance. Is there any greater fault?

Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the accumulated calamities of inherited burdens have amassed, all arising from this. Thus, the people are permitted to submit memorials. Now, the Radiant and Virtuous Lord governs, and Heaven, grieved by these hardships, has sent me to speak."

"Excellent! Excellent indeed!"

"Come, let me explain this to you, Perfected One. Today, a solar eclipse occurs—the greatest of all celestial omens—yet some witness it while others do not. The myriad strange omens and calamities of the world are all the transformative discourse of Heaven and Earth, the interplay of yin and yang. Some nations do not see them, but their provinces do; some provinces do not, but their commanderies do; some commanderies do not, but their counties do; some counties do not, but their townships do; some townships do not, but the common people do; some in one village do not, but those in another do.

Thus, in the governance of the ancient worthies and sages, even the lowliest were glad to receive unusual reports, aligning with the intent of Heaven and Earth to secure their well-being. Therefore, their rule alone remained perpetually peaceful, in perfect accord with Heaven. Now, as the qi of Great Peace arrives, if even one matter is amiss, disharmony arises, and the upright qi of Heaven fails to descend. It is like foolish people draining the water to catch fish—then the dragons vanish. This is what it means.

For this reason, all in the realm are now permitted to speak. Thus, not a single thread of Heaven’s intent is lost, and governance may be stabilized. The people, of their own accord, gather and submit memorials. Local officials, fearing they may lag behind the people’s words, must swiftly dispatch officers to inquire about what the people have witnessed and promptly report it upward. In this way, no omen or calamity will be overlooked.

Thus, the August Heaven and Revered Earth will rejoice greatly and cherish their emperor."

"How is this made clear?"

"There is proof. The sun and moon serve as its great illumination: the constellations maintain their courses, neither erring nor straying—this is the sign of Heaven’s joy. When Earth rejoices, the hundred rivers flow in order, not recklessly overflowing, and all things are nurtured, growing well and flourishing—this is the sign of Earth’s delight. Do you understand, Perfected One?"

"Yes, yes."

"Master, in your kindness, take pity on this foolish student. Those who have grasped these matters may come forward with questions. Since I have been treated with such generosity, I may now ask all my doubts. How should the people record omens, calamities, and strange phenomena?"

"Indeed! A fine question you ask. When such events are observed, record them at once, whether at dawn or dusk. At the month’s end, gather and deliberate together. What is fit to report, report upward; what is not yet sufficient, wait for further omens in the following month. In this way, the magistrates of each county and village will attend to the people’s observations at dawn and dusk, and it may be said that not even a hair’s breadth of Heaven’s omens will be lost. The officials will stand in awe of the people, and the people in awe of the officials. Both fearing one another, what is reported will all be truthful, not missing even a fraction’s weight. Thus, the emperor may sit in his secluded chamber without worry. All people, from ministers to commoners, great and small, will be loyal and trustworthy, their true sentiments fully conveyed. The realm will rejoice without exception.

If there are those who obstruct this, record them together—these are the treacherous ministers, the disloyal and unfilial people, those ignorant of Heaven and Earth, who deceive their superiors and sever the emperor’s clarity of perception. This is a grave transgression. Therefore, they must be swiftly recorded together. Do you understand, Perfected One?"

"Yes, yes."
"Go now, and if you have doubts, come and ask."
"Now the Six Perfected Ones all return in reverent contemplation, while the Celestial Master instructs the local officials and the people to jointly record calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences—what exactly should they record?"
"Excellent! The Six ask with such thoroughness, not deviating from the heart of Heaven nor failing the Virtuous Lord. This is meritorious before Heaven and Earth, and all things under creation will benefit from it. The reason is this: in their questioning of Heaven’s affairs □□, they exhaustively investigate and clarify all details, thus missing not even a fraction’s weight. Whatever Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the Three Luminaries, the Five Phases, the Four Seasons, the spirits, and the myriad things wish to express will all be made manifest—hence their great merit. Do you understand?"
"Yes, yes."
"Go now, and expound this clearly for the Six Perfected Ones, recording it carefully as you follow along."
"Yes, yes."

"Now then, the great calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences are the grand discourse of Heaven and Earth; the moderate calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences are their middling discourse; and the minor calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences are their lesser discourse. If you wish to grasp their essential meaning, it is like this: great matters call for grand discourse, middling matters for middling discourse, and minor matters for minor discourse. These, whether great or small, all have something to convey—they are not empty manifestations, for Heaven and Earth do not recklessly deceive humanity.

When great auspicious omens appear, it is their profound joy; when middling auspicious omens appear, it is their moderate joy; and when minor auspicious omens appear, it is their slight joy. When great inauspicious portents and misfortune appear, it is the great wrath of Heaven and Earth; when middling inauspicious portents and misfortune appear, it is their moderate wrath; and when minor inauspicious portents and misfortune appear, it is their slight wrath. When all is tranquil, with neither auspicious nor inauspicious changes, it is their state of equilibrium—neither joyful nor angry. Do you understand?"
"Yes, yes."

"Disasters, anomalies, strange transformations—whether great or small—must be recorded without the slightest omission. Why so thorough?"
"How foolish you are, Perfected One! All transgressions, great and small, must be observed; likewise, the magnitude of good and evil must all be seen and known. For good deeds, one should acknowledge their merit and reward them with greater blessings; for faults, one should repeatedly admonish them to align with the intent of Heaven and Earth. Do you wish to know their effects? Heaven is like a ruler or sovereign: if a minor word is disobeyed, it incurs slight resentment; if a middling word is disobeyed, it incurs greater resentment; if a major word is disobeyed, it brings harm. Thus, all must be recorded, great and small, so as not to provoke the resentment and wrath of Heaven and Earth."
"Excellent! Excellent! I wish to hear the purpose of such records."
"Record anomalies, disasters, illnesses—whether great or small, numerous or few—unseasonable winds and rains, and the sufferings of the people and all things, great or small, all gathered and recorded through deliberation. The reason for having them collectively recorded is this: officials will know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and the people will know one another’s strengths and weaknesses. Those dwelling near mountains and hills will know the changes in mountains and hills; those near markets, cities, and walled towns will know the changes in markets, cities, and walled towns; those near level lands will know the changes in level lands; those near low-lying fields and waters will know the changes in low-lying fields and waters. High and low, inner and outer—all will be known, and thus nothing will be lost. This is the method to swiftly attain Great Peace, the principle that emperors and kings should employ, the way to never lose the great intent of Heaven. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Yes, yes."
"Go, for you have understood."

Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the prevalence of inherited disasters stems from the failure to record, collectively and comprehensively, the great and small affairs of the common folk. When strange anomalies occur, officials from other jurisdictions are dispatched to investigate. Those in nearby jurisdictions, each guarding their own borders, conceal the truth and collude in silence, thereby severing the words of Heaven and Earth and preventing them from reaching the emperors and kings. This inflicts profound harm, causing Heaven’s sorrow to deepen and disasters to multiply—all fault lies here.

When officials from other jurisdictions come to examine matters, how can they know the long-standing sufferings of the people? Some, bound by deep ties of favor, repeatedly collude to conceal the truth. Others, harboring old grudges against certain households, fabricate disasters, falsely amplify misfortunes, and jointly suppress the facts. Thus, the discourse of Heaven and Earth is cut off, and the innocent are wronged anew, while those below follow in pursuit of bribes and wealth.

These three matters all give rise to great harm, knotting the qi of grievance and further compounding disasters. For this reason, governance becomes utterly unbalanced. Yet when the Great Yang arises, the qi of peace flourishes, and a virtuous ruler governs, the world attains Great Peace, and all find their rightful place.

Therefore, the Six Perfected Ones have come to inquire in full, and I have answered them completely. Do you understand, Perfected One?
"Yes, yes."

〈Beginning〉

Thus, when Heaven intends to support and bless an emperor or king, it first instills in him a will of his own. From ancient times to the present, whenever Heaven has sought to bestow its favor, it has invariably presented him with wondrous texts and extraordinary strategies, enabling him to govern by their guidance—whereupon all his undertakings prove greatly auspicious.

When Heaven does not intend to bless or benefit a ruler, it severs all such wondrous texts and extraordinary strategies, preventing him from obtaining them. Even if he should chance upon them, it renders his mind dull, so that he fails to recognize their value and apply them. But when Heaven intends to bring benefit, it opens his mind wide and bright, so that he delights in employing them.

This is the unchanging law of Heaven, which never deceives humankind.

Therefore, those who are about to rise invariably favor goodness, while those about to decline favor evil. Those destined for good fortune are easily guided, while those destined for misfortune delight in offending others and cannot be guided.

Do you understand this, Perfected One?
"Yes, yes."

Thus, Heaven constantly aids the good, and the Dao inclines toward those of virtue. Heaven refuses to aid the wicked, and the Dao refuses to cling to those who are foolish and benighted.

〈End〉

Therefore, it constantly instructs the Perfected Ones to entrust these matters to rulers of virtue. The reason for meticulously recording all portents—great and small, good and evil, internal and external, near and far—is to enable virtuous rulers, together with their worthy ministers, to trace the origins of these anomalies.

All the world’s strange portents and calamities arise as reflections of events, imitations of conduct, and manifestations of their kind. When worthy ministers gather to deliberate, their minds open wide to the matter, and by examining the phenomena in light of their categories, they arrive at the truth. Then Heaven and Earth rejoice daily, and the emperor and king attain daily peace. In this way, virtue thoroughly harmonizes with the spirits, and all respond in kind.

To witness its great efficacy: the world’s sufferings and anomalies vanish entirely, ministers and people all act with goodness, and they follow imperial edicts to the letter, not erring by even a fraction. This is the clear proof that those below do not deceive their enlightened ruler.

Where there is much harm, there is much deceit; where there is little harm, there is little deceit; where there is no harm at all, there is no deceit whatsoever. By constantly observing what is presented from below, one may gauge the loyalty or disloyalty of ministers and people, great and small. Matched against the facts, it is like gazing into a bright mirror while speaking face to face.

How wondrous! To practice the Dao in this way—this is the bright mirror by which Heaven aids the ruler of supreme virtue to govern the world.

Do you understand this, Perfected One?
"Yes, yes."

Go now and swiftly deliver this to the ruler of virtue. If a single person submits a memorial alone, it is called "casting a document"—to entrust governance to one man’s word is called "great deceit," which incurs profound resentment from August Heaven and disrupts the constant order of the Dao.

If two people submit a memorial together, it is called "Great Yin," a collusion of treachery and deceit. Two cunning men firmly caution one another; or, if they share some grievance, they jointly submit falsehoods, thereby offending Earth and throwing the Earthly Dao into great disorder.

If three people submit a memorial together, their words remain fundamentally untrue. Though three may caution and instruct one another, if they share some grievance and submit it together, using public office to settle private scores, they fundamentally deceive their ruler, becoming enemies of harmony and throwing the qi of peace into great disorder.

If four people submit a memorial together, there is often one among them who fears the truth, whose words are seized upon by others to exploit his weaknesses. Though their account may seem plausible, its falsehood disrupts the four seasons.

If five people submit a memorial together, it may seem true but lacks certainty; its falsehood disrupts the five phases.

If six people submit a memorial together, it approaches truth but remains uncertain; its falsehood disrupts the six harmonies.

If seven people submit a memorial together, it appears trustworthy; eight approach truth; nine approach reality; ten achieve a measure of reliability.

"Why, Heavenly Master, do you harbor so many doubts?"
"I wish to hear the essential point."
"Indeed, the reason for so many doubts is that in the five directions, cunning men each harbor private grievances. Using public office to settle private scores, they firmly collude to commit great deceit, disrupting the Dao of Heaven and Earth to mislead their ruler. Thus, I dare not readily trust them, but treat them with caution.

Therefore, gather people of all ages—worthy and unworthy, men and women, down to servants and slaves—to deliberate together. In this way, falsehoods cannot prevail, nor can public office be used to settle private scores.

Among them, there may be some who feel uneasy and speak out: some may be unworthy, some may have loose tongues and fail to conceal the truth, some may be elders whose lives hang by a thread and who no longer fear consequences, or women and children may speak carelessly, unable to hide the truth. Thus, their collusion is exposed, and all deceit is revealed in its true form. When the truth is obtained, the hearts of Heaven and Earth are harmonized.

Do you understand this, Perfected One?"
"Yes, yes."

The reason emperors and kings have repeatedly inherited and borne the burden of past transgressions, and why governance constantly loses the favor of Heaven, is that disasters flow unceasingly. When one is cut off, another arises; August Heaven is not at peace, and harmful qi and illnesses abound, preventing longevity. Great joy is fleeting, and joy soon turns to sorrow—the root of this great fault lies precisely here.

Cunning and treacherous men jointly betray Heaven and Earth to deceive the emperor. Yet people regard Heaven and Earth as their destiny and the emperor as their father and mother. Fools who betray their destiny and jointly deceive their father and mother incur the hatred of Heaven and Earth and the emperor’s wrath. Their punishment is a vile death, and their remaining sins will be visited upon future lives.

Thus, disasters do not cease, harm increases daily, human lifespans shorten, and all things are constantly in disorder—the root of this fault lies precisely here.

Have you now fully awakened to this, Perfected One?"
"Yes, yes."

"Truly, you may be said to have understood this. Therefore, I know that August Heaven deeply abhors evil, and for this reason, I have repeatedly composed these writings to establish equilibrium. To omit even a single matter is to invite its resurgence—what was lost in the past may be recovered in the future, yet this matter is especially grave, for Heaven greatly detests it. I know its [omitted characters], and thus reveal and instruct the Perfected One, entrusting it to a ruler of supreme virtue and power. If he obtains and practices it, he will differ not from the divine, and the upright qi of the Great Peace and Highest Sovereign will arise of itself. My writings dare not betray Heaven and Earth, nor the ruler of supreme virtue, nor the people of future generations and later ages, nor the myriad things. Once practiced, their effects will be immediate."

"Excellent! Excellent! I wish to hear: why does one man’s memorial to the throne disrupt Heaven, and why do two men disrupt Earth?"

"This arises from their households, where aligned strategies resonate and stir one another—such is the natural law. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go, for you have now understood. All matters under Heaven follow their own kind."

"I venture to ask, Master of Heaven: if these words are put into practice, can they be fully verified, so that all under Heaven will believe?"

"Yes, all under Heaven will believe."

"I wish to hear the essential meaning."

"Very well, let me tell you the great essentials, Perfected One."

"Now, the current rulers and local officials fear that the people will expose their affairs, and thus they employ the six examinations to verify truthfulness, thereby securing trust. The people, too, fear the county authorities and, upon discovering their faults, likewise trust them. The county authorities and local officials, along with the residents, also fear those who travel to other regions to submit memorials, for if their faults are exposed, they too will be trusted. Those who submit memorials likewise fear that the county authorities, local officials, and residents will uncover their faults, and so they too are trusted. Each fears the other, and none dare speak falsely, nor can they conceal anything. Therefore, when memorials are submitted from three sources—the county authorities, the residents, and the travelers—they all align at dawn, not deviating by even a fraction. How wondrous is the Dao when practiced thus! I wish to hear the outcome."

"When should those who gather to deliberate assemble?"

"Excellent! Your words shall all be recorded beneath the abode of *Tai Ping Lai Shan*. Why must it be there?"

"Indeed, for there are extraordinary methods and singular texts that may be deposited in the *Tai Ping Lai Shan* abode, where good and evil are deliberated beneath it, and matters from all directions are collectively submitted. If only one person deliberates, they may regret and halt, or be stopped by others. If a memorial is submitted but then abandoned midway, the concealed matter shall be punished as a crime. Through such writings, all under Heaven will be obtained, and the emperor and kings will long wander in leisure."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Now that the Celestial Master’s writings have accumulated in great number, where should they all be deposited?"

"Those writings that are produced solely for the ruler shall remain with the ruler; all that are produced for the affairs of the world shall be made public. Do you understand?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"Go then. The ruler of supreme virtue is naturally moved by Heaven to possess a sagely mind. Moreover, through this, he naturally forms good intentions and naturally establishes good ordinances and rituals—this is the celestial law, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Yet the matters are too numerous to record, and the texts are ever burdensome. Go now."

"Indeed, indeed."

*Here ends the Heaven’s decree to the Six Perfected Ones, instructing them to further comprehend the three methods for circulating written texts.*

**Scroll Eighty-Seven, Ji Section, Part Two**
**Perpetual Talisman Diagram, One Hundred Twenty-Eighth**

The celestial talisman returns essence when inscribed in cinnabar. Once inscribed and taken into the abdomen, one shall perceive the writings within the abdomen—greatly auspicious, and all evil departs.

The Five Offices and Five Kings are the inception of the Dao, the ancestors of spirits. Carefully seal them, closing the gates and doors. Though darkness reigns without, light shines within—how could one not see clearly? Guard this long and steadfastly, and the celestial physicians shall descend of themselves; all illnesses shall be dispelled, and one shall thereby attain longevity.

The foolish discard it, while the wise treasure it as a priceless gem—this may be called the Way of Perpetual Existence. Alone it honors the natural, with form and spirit mutually safeguarding. When these two embrace one another, strange thoughts shall instead bring misfortune. If you lose the natural, you cannot attain longevity. The infant’s five essences return to preserve themselves.

**Collated and Combined *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Eighty-Eight, Ji Section, Part Three**
**Tai Ping Jing, Scroll Eighty-Eight**

**Method for Establishing Houses of Goodness, One Hundred Twenty-Nine**

The Six Directions Perfected Ones bowed twice and said, "We humbly ask to resolve a doubt."
"Speak," came the reply.
"Previously, the Celestial Master instructed us to compile and collate essential texts from the High, Middle, and Low Antiquities, as well as the oral secrets of the wise and enlightened. Now, within and beyond the four borders—whether ten thousand *li* from the imperial court or farther—some possess good writings, though their texts are scant and insufficient, and must be carried from afar to the capital. Others hold rare texts, extraordinary methods, or wondrous arts; reclusive scholars and cave-dwelling worthies, though loath to travel ten thousand *li*, journey to the Son of Heaven to offer their Dao and virtue for sale. Still others—common folk, the young and weak, the old and small, farm children, and women—each harbor some good characters, oral secrets, or a few lines, yet their offerings are too meager to warrant sending someone to the capital. And among the barbarians of the four borders, the hidden peoples, the Hu and Mo tribes, though some know profound and secret Dao, even if they recognize the great luminous virtue of the Chinese ruler, they cannot bear the journey to present their rare texts, good strategies, or extraordinary methods.

Yet the Celestial Master has now gathered all ancient and modern spirit writings from the Yellow River and Luo River, along with the oral secrets of the wise, to form this *Sutra of Penetrating the Ultimate*—a work unparalleled since the opening of Heaven and Earth. With it, all disasters may be dispelled, the Emperor may wander in joy, and governance may proceed with folded arms and no cares. If even one matter is left unprepared, calamities may yet remain; thus, all must be gathered together.

But how are these rare methods, extraordinary strategies, and good characters to be obtained in full?"

"Excellent! Excellent! The Perfected Ones ponder deeply, and the celestial spirits have already informed them. The qi of the Supreme August One now aids the virtuous ruler □□. Go—now that the Perfected Ones have asked on behalf of the August Spirit of Heaven, it is my duty to expound fully for the world. How could I dare be remiss? Very well. Let the Perfected Ones be seated, and I shall explain all to them."

"Indeed."

"Entrust this text to the August Emperor of Supreme Virtue. When he sees the celestial patterns, he must grasp their essential meaning and command the provinces, commanderies, and distant regions of the four borders—every county, village, and hamlet—to each establish a fine House of Goodness along the great thoroughfares of the cities. Let it stand three *zhang* high, with a breadth and depth of three *zhang* as well, and construct openings on all four sides, level with a person’s face. The gaps between the openings should allow hands to pass through, shielding the doors so none may enter recklessly. Hang writings outside, making the texts clearly visible, and inscribe the four sides of the house as well. The texts shall proclaim that the Emperor seeks good people, rare and extraordinary methods, good strategies, oral secrets, and whatever wisdom the people hold in their hearts—whatever they can articulate. Let all write these down and deposit them in this house, recording their names. Thereafter, summon them, and according to the magnitude of their virtue and ability, appoint them to office. For those whose words are many but whose abilities cannot be verified, let the local officials of the counties and commanderies temporarily employ them. For the elderly, the weak, and women with good words, let the overseers reward them. For those whose merits are great but who cannot serve, let them be exempted. For those beyond the four borders who present good and extraordinary strategies with great efficacy, let them be richly rewarded.

Thus, within and beyond the four borders, all shall unite in a single day to rejoice and strive for the Emperor’s sake. From top to bottom, from within to without, no rare method, good character, or extraordinary strategy shall remain hidden. In a single day, all shall turn to delight in goodness. Hidden scholars and cave-dwelling recluses shall emerge into the cities, and upon seeing the Emperor’s Houses of Goodness for the coming of Great Peace, none shall conceal themselves. Wind and rain shall arrive in season, the Three Luminaries shall shine brightly—these are the signs of Heaven’s great joy. Among the eighty-one domains of the four barbarians, the good, the worthy, and the sages, hearing of the great virtue of the Chinese ruler’s governance, shall all delight in coming to submit. Bearing their rare treasures, they shall arrive in unbroken procession. Not one in ten thousand of my words shall be lost—how could this not be a cause for great joy? With governance of such great virtue, do the Perfected Ones now understand?"

"Indeed."

"Indeed, you have now awakened. In those houses where the written works are too numerous, the overseers shall further open their doors, gather the texts within, and bring them to be arranged together with the senior officials and the assembly of worthies. Among these, the good shall be grouped by category, the evil removed, and repetitions eliminated, ordering them by sequence. They shall then be presented to the Emperor. The Emperor shall again have the assembly of worthies arrange them, removing repetitions and what is evil or improper, grouping them by category, and placing them in a secluded repository. He shall further await the arrival of texts from the four directions, ordering them sequentially, again grouping them by category, and awaiting the arrival of later texts.

When the good houses from the four directions have produced rare and excellent writings, wondrous methods, and fine strategies, these shall again be carefully sealed. Where their accumulated stores are abundant, they shall again be arranged and presented. As the texts from the four directions diminish day by day, what is presented shall be largely the same. The assembly of enlightened worthies shall gather and arrange them, compiling them into the *Scripture of the Utmost Cavern*. Thereupon, the greatly awakened worthies shall transmit them downward to return to the people. The hundred clans and the myriad peoples shall all at once be transformed toward goodness, no longer knowing the ways of evil. This is what is called fully winning the hearts of Heaven, Earth, humankind, and the four barbarians—great joy arriving daily, all uniting as one family to together accomplish one governance.

Do the Six Perfected Ones understand this?"

"Indeed."

"Go forth, for the Six Perfected Ones have now understood. When the barbarians hear of this, they shall retreat day by day, and the Central Kingdom shall daily expand, growing stronger without warfare or conquest. Heaven and Earth shall assist in eliminating evil—this has never been seen since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Thus is the great joy of the world. The spirits of Heaven and Earth shall together eliminate the Emperor’s inherited burdens, and calamities and omens shall vanish. His governance shall be no different from that of the gods.

The people of the world shall greatly obtain the wondrous methods of the Dao and virtue, all contemplating good writings and correct words, no longer engaging in wickedness or evil. What is presented shall grow ever better with each year. Thereafter, a minor compilation shall be made every three years, and a major compilation every five years, arranging them. These shall then be appended and returned to the people, causing them each to delight in goodness and be unable to restrain themselves. From among them, the most excellent matters that benefit the Emperor’s correct governance shall be retained and not transmitted downward.

Do the Perfected Ones understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Now then, Perfected One, Heaven has sent your disciples to inquire—since this is already a matter of Heaven’s questioning, you shall compose the *Scripture of Great Joy* for the Virtuous Lord. Exert yourself and do not slacken. Heaven shall repay your merit: you shall remove illness for the August Heaven and Earth, and dispel the calamities, poisons, and inherited burdens that afflict the Emperor. Your lifespan shall surely be extended. My words do not dare deceive the Perfected One—heed them well."

"Yes, yes."

"Go now and return. Strive with utmost diligence. If you have doubts, come again."

"Yes, yes."

"Perfected One, when you came forward to ask your questions, I had long wished to depart. Thus, I had already composed the text of our parting. Yet seeing your earnestness, I knew you were aided by the yang essence of August Heaven. The reason for this is that I perceive your sincerity: the Central Kingdom shall flourish in great peace, and the eighty-one domains shall send forth good people to return and submit to it. Therefore, I stayed longer for you, exhaustively expounding all matters. The reason for this is that I saw your unceasing inquiries on Heaven’s behalf, and feared you might incur great transgression, bringing censure from Heaven and Earth. Thus, I dared not abandon the Dao and depart midway."

"Do you understand, Perfected One?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go now, and strive to perfect this to the end. Do not abandon the Dao or neglect even a single precept."

"Yes, yes."

"I humbly request that you expound on this matter: Master of Heaven, what did you observe in the bustling crossroads of the cities when you established the chamber for the coming of good writings, wondrous strategies, and secret methods of the Great Peace?"

"Excellent, Perfected One, your difficult question has grasped the essential meaning. Has the Emperor tasked you with this arduous inquiry? How skillfully you have framed your words! Yet from my dwelling in Heaven, I have observed what may be seen—it was not in vain that I established this abode of August Peace at the crossroads.

When the Lord of Heaven asked, 'Why is it so difficult for the world to attain peace and tranquility?' The divine officials of the Five Phases replied: 'Now the Emperor dwells within a hundredfold enclosure, tens of thousands of *li* distant from the four borders. Those far away are often entangled in grievances, and good and evil cannot ascend to reach him. Wondrous methods, extraordinary writings, and uncommon strategies are cut off and never arrive before the Emperor. The people and ministers, bound by grievances, cannot petition or communicate. Over time, the four directions become obstructed and blocked. The worthy and learned conceal themselves, harboring the Dao and virtue in their hearts, yet perish in sorrow. The Emperor, deprived of their extraordinary strategies and uncommon words, cannot pacify the world. The great fault lies in the closure and disconnection of the distant frontiers in the four directions and eight boundaries.'

Thus, in accordance with Heaven’s will, I have established this abode for the coming of good writings on behalf of the Emperor of the Great Peace and virtue, bringing the qi of the Supreme August One and the balanced governance of antiquity to the crossroads. I wish to gladden the four directions, so all may know that the Virtuous Lord has issued these teachings. In joyful unison, they shall each bring their good offerings and uncommon methods, coming to submit them from near and far, without obstruction or severance."

"Excellent! Excellent! Without the Master of Heaven’s efforts in inquiry, this could not have been known."

"Indeed, what the Perfected One says is true. By nature, humans possess innate knowledge—this is the highest; those who cannot know innately must inquire through effort—this is the next best. Do you understand this?"

"Indeed, indeed. I humbly ask to pose one question: why must it be made three *zhang* in breadth and three *zhang* in height?"

"Excellent is your question! First, the number one is the beginning of all numbers. The celestial numbers also culminate in ten, the terrestrial numbers also culminate in ten, and the human numbers also culminate in ten—thus it is made three *zhang*. To bring joy and harmonize Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, so all may be pleased together, it is modeled after Heaven, Earth, and Humanity."

"Now I ask: why do the three numbers all culminate in ten?"

"Thus: Heaven possesses the Five Phases and also has its own yin and yang; Earth possesses the Five Phases and also has its own yin and yang; Humanity possesses the Five Phases and also has its own yin and yang. Therefore, all reach ten."

"Excellent! Excellent! Are only Heaven, Earth, and Humanity like this? Are all things in the myriad realms also thus?"

"All things in the myriad realms model themselves after Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Thus, Heaven, Earth, and Humanity all follow the Four Seasons and Five Phases in waxing and waning. Does the Perfected One understand this?"

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Now you may be said to have understood this."

"I humbly request to ask one matter."

"Speak."

"Why must the registers be made for the four directions, and why must they be level with the face?"

"Thus: the registers are made so that worthy scholars may inscribe them. The registers allow the four directions to be open and unobstructed, no longer closed off, so that the worthy may each record their words and submit them to this Chamber of Great Peace and Goodness. As for being level with the face: the face is the finest part of a person, the portion of the Great Yang, modeled after the Dao of Heaven. It delights people to each follow the heart of Heaven, contemplating goodness, joining forces with the virtuous ruler to together bring peace to the world—thus they are made level with the face. The face has the Seven Orifices: ears, eyes, mouth, and nose through which qi may pass, and through which spirits and deities come and go. It delights the great worthy to inscribe them, so that the distant lands of the four directions and eight extremities may all become perceptive and come forth. Now, though the emperor dwells within a hundredfold enclosure, separated from the people by ten thousand leagues, his radiant teachings and commands all reach and penetrate, never losing the heart of Heaven and Earth, thereby securing his person."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

“May I ask, what sort of officials should be appointed to guard this dwelling?”

“Senior officials shall be directly assigned, and upon their proclamation of its name, it shall be called the Dwelling of Great Peace, the Office of Delighting in Goodness.”

“Excellent! Now that I, a foolish student, have come to know the will of Heaven, I rejoice greatly. Earth, too, is deeply pleased and moves with caution. The people have attained the governance of Great Peace, and the myriad things have each found their proper place.”

“How does the Perfected One come to know this?”

“I, a foolish student, have witnessed the Heavenly Master, as the Virtuous Ruler of Great Peace, constructing this grand dwelling of joy to facilitate the discourse between Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Now, it enables the common people and subjects to each present their words to their sovereign, allowing the emperor to obtain extraordinary strategies and rare texts of singular methods that ensure his long-term security. Moreover, Heaven and Earth may now communicate their discourse, and the humble and lowly among the people can convey their virtuous words, thereby dispelling the gloom of Heaven and Earth and aiding their ruler in becoming perceptive and enlightened. Heaven, Earth, and humanity, as the foremost of all things, are now fully interconnected—hence the great joy.”

“What the Perfected One has said is true. Excellent! I have nothing to add. Your words on this matter deeply enter the true Dao.”

“May I ask one further question?”

“Speak.”

“Now Heaven is gloomy and desires to speak—why then does it instead cause *people* to discourse?”

“Excellent! Your challenging question has grasped the essence. Yet, the Dao of Heaven turns and interrelates, mutually employing one another. Thus, *dui* (the trigram of openness) serves as the mouth of Heaven and Earth, and so too do humans. Like seeks like, and thus people become the voice of Heaven and Earth. Does the Perfected One understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go now, for you are easily enlightened. Strive, strive!”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Very well, this minor discourse is concluded; ask no more. The written teachings of the Dao are difficult to comprehend and may only deepen confusion.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go now, and let me caution the Perfected One on one matter: you have already collated rare texts and singular methods. Roll and present one virtuous method—a foundational art of nurturing inner nature—beneath the scrolls, so that the multitude of worthies may recite and study it. This shall serve as the culmination of the *Dongji* scripture. Let each gather these methods for self-cultivation, recite these arts for self-preservation, and thus delight in long endurance. The most worthy may serve as state advisors, the moderately worthy as minor officials, and even the lowliest, who cannot hold office, may long nurture their parents and steadfastly guard their descendants.”

“Excellent! Excellent! The world shall know great joy and delight, and goodness shall have no equal—no more shall there be evil people.”

“You have already understood. Go now, and reflect upon this. Since you have inquired of Heaven’s affairs, do not grow lax.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

Here follows the translation:

To the right: *Seeking Virtue to Attain Great Peace and Unify All Under Heaven in a Single Day, That All May Converge in Heart at the Abode of the Supreme August One’s Great Joy*—Text of the *Scripture of Great Peace: Collated Edition*, Scroll Eighty-Nine, Ji Section Four. *Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Eighty-Nine: “Recitation on the Eight Trigrams’ Return of Essence,” One Hundred and Thirtieth.

Mysterious brightness illumines within; the great darkness abounds in qi. Sharing rank with the worthy, it dwells in the abodes of *ren* and *gui*. *Hai* and *zi* share a body, circulating and embracing one another. When utmost yin gives birth to yang, it is called *Initial Nine*. Once united, it generates beings: yin halts, yang arises. Receiving bestowal from *hai*, conceiving in *ren*, it flourishes in *zi*. From child to grandchild, yang enters yin’s midst—its generation knows no end.

Contemplate the outer to penetrate the inner; lifespan doubles. This cannot be swiftly attained—it is fitting for long endurance. Lesser yang holds qi, sharing rank with the liver, in *jia*, *yi*, *yin*, and *mao*, where azure hues are akin. The essence of the myriad things emerges in profusion, front and back intermingling. Benevolence and kindness settle in the heart.

When a valiant warrior is about to set forth, let him contemplate and behold this character: its radiance is like the sun at first light. A hundred illnesses are cured, and years increase threefold. Greater yang, abundant in qi, resembles the heart, dwelling in the house of *bing* and *ding*, nurtured in the positions of *si* and *wu*. Beholding it, a hundred evils depart, and the body daily grows upright. One should cultivate a gentle and luminous intent—this must not be forcibly sought. Upon seeing the character, one gains longevity, its light like the brightness of the sun at midday.

The qi of central harmony connects with the spleen, extending to the four seasons’ quarters before returning to *wu* and *ji*. It resides centrally in *chen* and *xu*, with *chou* and *wei* as its root. Raise and follow it, contemplating its intent, and apply it to cure illness—its essence is like the Yellow Dragon. Upon seeing this character, one’s illness vanishes, and years increase fivefold. It makes people compliant and filial, ministers loving toward their lords, and children loving toward their fathers.

In the period of lesser yin, it joins with the essence of the teacher. The numinous fan emits qi, its position belonging to *geng* and *xin*. In *shen* and *you*, righteousness executes; crafty evildoers and thieves do not arise, and evil cannot harm people. The qi of the flourishing kidneys increases lifespan a hundredfold. When utmost yin gives birth to yang, the state greatly prospers. Constantly contemplating it, one knows not death.

Yin ascends, yang arises—thus the Dark Warrior marks the beginning. The virtue of the dragon is born in the north, its position in the east, and thus follows thereafter. The Vermilion Bird governs illness; the yellow qi rectifies the center. Should the ruler practice this, his lifespan shall be boundless. Ascending to uphold equilibrium, a hundred evils perish. The Eight Trigrams reside within, and the spirits form ranks in procession. The White Tiger follows behind, executing calamities and annihilating misfortune. The true Dao arrives daily, and perverse qi vanishes. Contemplate essence without cease—this is the record of extended years. Should one embody and internalize it, what sorrow could there be?

Following below what is above is called *Compliance with the Dao*. Without fault or transgression, a myriad illnesses heal themselves. Contemplate the character and behold its form; love it as father and son. It makes one perpetually joyful, penetratingly illuminating without end. Those who examine and apply it shall await its effects at once. Long accompany the text, and daily wander with the spirits.

The Dao takes spontaneity as its profound emptiness. It does not come of itself in a single day—its Dao is benevolent and good. Children practice filial piety for it; ministers offer loyalty. Those who truly know it come to cherish their bodies, dare not speak recklessly, and guard it without cease—thus their lives know no end. The text does not emerge in vain; contemplate it in connection with the Dao. Deeply grasp its intent, and the spirits shall come of themselves.

At the inception, contemplate the character’s form, and return to the origin of the Dao. Essence attains spirit illumination, and thus there is no spontaneity. The Dao of Heaven has myriad beginnings—what lies with humans may be enacted. When the Dao accomplishes its work, □□ does not act wrongly. The concern is that people do not exert themselves—whence could upright qi be obtained? Practicing without ascending, the days grow auspicious and danger recedes.

Should a great person practice this, his state attains Great Peace. Should a petty person practice it, he averts calamity and invites blessing. Contemplate its subtle depths, and all inclinations become complete. Should a child guard the Dao, whence could disorder arise? Contemplate without cease, and Great Peace comes of itself. The heart unconfused, without perverse inclinations, guard it without cease, and the days generate themselves. The Dao does not emerge recklessly—it is entrusted to those with virtue and returns to its proper person.

**Grievance, Calamity, and the Pursuit of Extraordinary Methods: First Scroll, Section One Hundred Thirty-One**

Before the Perfected One, you study this. In all matters, accumulate knowledge, and you shall understand the great principles by which the world is ordered. Only afterward may affairs be discussed—then doubt shall no longer remain.

Now, when common folk die, they wail in great grievance, beating their breasts and crying to Heaven, flinging themselves to the ground and wailing to Earth. Is this right? Or is it wrong?

One ought to refine the Dao with utmost care, so that it may be recited and read for ten thousand generations, becoming an enduring law never to be forgotten.

Today, the Celestial Master has issued strict teachings—how dare this foolish student not strive to speak a word?

Proceed without doubt.

Yet death is a grave matter for mortals. To wail in great grievance, beating the breast and flinging oneself down, exhausting all strength in endless sorrow—this does no harm to life. But for whom, then, should one grieve? And why grieve for all?

When a person dies, they are utterly extinguished, reduced to ashes and dust, never to be seen again. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, each person is born but once, never to be reborn. From the moment they are named as human, they are the foremost of all creatures, harmonious and balanced, noble and honored, akin to Heaven and Earth. Yet upon death, they vanish forever, never again to rise or walk as one called human. Thus, the grief is great, and the grievance profound.

Alas! Your words align with the vulgar, yet they are not truly so.

This foolish student fails to grasp the meaning. What, then, should one do when a person dies? I beg to hear it, O Celestial Master.

All things that live must come to an end; human life, too, must end in death—this is the ordained pattern of Heaven and Earth. Even Heaven itself sometimes mourns those who die unjustly or perish young.

Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things. Fearing that some may die in grievance, weeping and wailing to Heaven above and knocking their heads upon the Earth below, mourning their short years, Heaven has thus bestowed the true Dao and extraordinary methods for self-preservation, allowing some to attain modest longevity.

All living things naturally age and perish, yet foolish people refuse to diligently study the true Dao and virtuous methods. How, then, can they slightly extend their years, delaying death and deferring old age? Instead, they treat themselves with careless disregard, seeking no extraordinary methods, and together mock and belittle the true Dao. They turn to deception and falsehood, disrupting the Dao of Heaven, deceiving their superiors, and competing to prepare burial mounds, tending to them in anticipation of death. They prearrange funerary contracts and mourning garments, seeking death and thus obtaining it. What, then, is there to grieve?

When one’s years are spent and their fate exhausted, it is like the sun rising and inevitably setting. Why, then, does the Perfected One grieve?

The Perfected One’s words often align with the vulgar—it seems you know nothing of humanity. Why is this?

For whom, then, should one grieve? I wish to hear it.

One should grieve for those who die young, before gaining any knowledge, who never had the chance to seek means of self-defense. Thus, they are to be grieved.

One should also grieve for those who are ever cautious and good, who fear dying young and thus endure hardship in their conduct, seeking the true Dao, virtuous power, and extraordinary methods. They act with constant goodness, never harming in secret, yet may encounter calamity and die prematurely, or reach old age with strength exhausted, never having met a wise teacher, even briefly, to fulfill their natural lifespan. These are the truly grievous cases, worthy of sorrow.

But those who grieve without cause, who do not seek extraordinary methods or the true Dao yet die, only to beat their breasts, weep, cry to Heaven, and knock their heads upon the Earth—such people bring this upon themselves, rebelling against Heaven and Earth. They are rebellious folk, and Heaven deeply resents and despises them.

If the Perfected One grieves for these, it would be better to mourn early for failing to learn the true Dao, for not understanding the great principles of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and their divisions. Long have you suffered without a wise teacher, harboring sorrow as your natural years draw to a close. This is truly lamentable—do you understand?

Indeed, indeed! This foolish student is deeply alarmed. My fate rests with the Celestial Master.

I now impart the true Dao to you, wishing you to exert yourself without cease. What in the world is unattainable? It is only that you do not seek with sufficient diligence. When utmost sincerity moves Heaven with flowing tears, Heaven will not withhold its gifts. If you do not slacken in your pursuit of the Dao, you shall obtain it before long. Do you understand?

Indeed, indeed!

Foolish people do not cherish and love themselves. They do not strive to seek extraordinary methods that might grant them even a brief respite. Instead, they prepare their funerary vessels and burial places in advance, seeking death. Heaven’s laws are like those of a compassionate father, a wise mother, or a sagacious ruler—they do not deprive one of what may be sought.

It is the natural and constant pursuit of what is sought that earns its name. Thus, one may not grieve excessively.

Therefore, in ancient times, sages and emperors who greatly cherished and feared death would day and night ponder and seek rare knowledge and extraordinary methods. They revered those who practiced the Dao, exhausting their wealth in the pursuit. With utmost sincerity and flowing tears, they moved the August Heaven, which then manifested auspicious signs. Masters of the Dao and its arts all came to their aid. Thus, many attained long life, and some transcended the world.

Yet there were those who sought but did not obtain, for their sincerity was not steadfast. They favored worldly affairs, treated their lives with careless disregard, and claimed they could be reborn. Today, Heaven and Earth regard humans as their children, and emperors as the most honored of Heaven’s children. How could they begrudge the true Dao and extraordinary methods?

Do you understand?

Indeed, indeed!

Thus, the sages of antiquity pondered deeply and planned far ahead, knowing that the wealth of the world is not eternally possessed.

While one lives, wealth and possessions are merely entrusted to the body.

When the body perishes, wealth and possessions pass to others. Thus, there is nothing to cling to—exhaust all wealth to aid oneself in seeking the true Dao and rare teachings. In this way, the body may endure long, while wealth remains, ever belonging to others. Therefore, one should strive to empty all wealth. Wealth is but a fleeting pursuit, gained in an instant. To lose it is merely to return it to the world, for it was never truly one’s own to keep. This is what marks the wise and sagacious: they nurture the body with the Dao, understand the proper use of wealth, and thus often attain long life. Do you understand?"

"Indeed, indeed!"

"Go forth. Those who would be teachers face many hardships and slander, yet the true person remains steadfast. Let me explain further for your sake. The Dao of Heaven has its principles and laws, not favoring any by familiarity. If you wish to truly know its workings, consider this: after the winter solstice, Heaven brings great cold that kills; yet in the fifth month, the first signs of yin qi appear in the well, growing clearer day by day. By the time the winter solstice arrives, the cold becomes so severe it harms and kills those without clothing. The wise prepare in advance and thus enjoy great joy, unharmed by the cold and free from worry. But the indolent, who do not exert themselves or make preparations, suffer hunger, cold, and destitution—this is the meaning. Heaven commits no error; it is people who bring this upon themselves. Do you now understand more deeply?"

"Yes, yes."
"Good, you have awakened."
"The laws of Heaven do not favor anyone by sudden familiarity—it is the foolish who bring trouble upon themselves by reckless disregard. May I ask: what kind of grievance is even greater than this?"
"The greatest grievance is that of the great worthy. From youth, they study goodness, follow what is right, and possess true virtue and power, destined to assist the emperor in governing the yin and yang. If the emperor obtains such a one, he will be at ease in heart and mind, ruling effortlessly without worry. But if such a person is obstructed and blocked, their true virtue and power persisting until old age and death—this is a grievous sorrow. Yet if the emperor fails to secure such a great worthy and enlightened advisor, and instead governs alongside the foolish, the yin and yang fall into chaos, myriad calamities arise, and he toils day and night in suffering, beset by great sorrow. This is an even greater grievance, a profound cause for lament.

Thus, in ancient times, the sagely and enlightened, those of great understanding, saw all worthies emerge and gather to serve as their aides. Therefore, neither ruler nor minister suffered grievance. Heaven and Earth, too, were governed by this principle, free from affliction and grievance—how much more so for humankind?

Have you grasped this, Perfected One?"
"Yes, yes. Excellent!"

"The Celestial Master speaks thus."
"By what is this deemed good?"
"Indeed, this is what Heaven attains—to resolve suffering and affliction. When the emperor attains it, he governs with folded arms, free from sorrow. The worthy, too, fulfill their loyal and faithful hearts, aiding their lord in governance, and exert their utmost efforts tirelessly. Together, they resolve the great sorrows of Heaven and Earth, and the myriad people and all things likewise attain it and flourish. Thus, it is called *excellent*."

"Excellent! The Perfected One’s words leave me nothing to add. Therefore, for all who may seek and act, there is no grievance or entanglement—each attains what they pursue of their own accord. If what one seeks is not attained, it becomes a great grievance. Now, if one seeks death and obtains death, seeks evil and obtains evil, seeks goodness and obtains goodness, Heaven follows their heart—this is great fortune, for what is sought is attained. If one deliberately places themselves in mortal peril, makes a death pact, and thus meets death, it is so. If one daily seeks misfortune, obtains calamity, and dies, it is likewise so. In all false and mundane affairs, what one seeks is granted by Heaven and Earth—there is no greater betrayal of this person.

Perfected One, have you not yet fully awakened?"
"Yes, yes."
"Go, you have awakened. Now, I wish to expound for you the complete text of its benefits. I have already outlined its great principles for you. Reflect upon its meaning, and present it to the lord of virtue and power, that it may be shown to the multitude of worthies. Let each exert effort in their pursuits. If what is sought is not attained, it is because one has not yet reached utmost sincerity. For Heaven and Earth are like echo and shadow—they do not deceive. The sorrow lies in the foolish, each deceiving themselves, belittling and neglecting themselves. The great fault lies here. The multitude of fools together disrupt Heaven and Earth, not merely bringing sorrow upon themselves. Their transgression is thus, and Heaven is greatly aggrieved by it. When the foolish seek and attain their ends, yet in destitution turn to wail and cry out to Heaven and Earth, their accumulated folly over time deeply grieves Heaven and Earth. Thus, I have been sent down to fully explain and resolve the intentions of the world’s people, that the multitude of worthies and enlightened may together deliberate upon my words. My words are the discourse of Heaven and Earth. I do not idly speak of these matters with the Perfected One—it is the instruction and command of Heaven, which I have descended to convey. Let each know the origin of their transgressions and no longer blame one another. Thus, I have spoken fully. I dare not speak falsely. The reason I exhaustively expound is that I alone understand the heart of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, I have been sent to descend and discuss the world with the Perfected One, to distinguish right from wrong, that the virtuous lord and the worthies may together reflect upon it. Let it be transmitted for ten thousand generations. Those of later times shall chant and recite it as a constant law, never to be forgotten.

Thus, whenever I see the Perfected One inquire of matters, I always delight in resolving them for Heaven, and with each resolution, a sorrow is dispelled. Therefore, whenever I behold the words of Heaven, I receive the heart of Heaven and the intent of Earth, and distinguish and expound the Dao accordingly. I dare not be remiss. If you have doubts, come again to discuss them. Since I have been entrusted and sent down to speak, I truly revere the majesty of Heaven and hold nothing back.

Have you deeply and clearly understood?"
"Yes, yes."
"Go, you have grasped the intent of Heaven and Earth. May you comprehend matters and give rise to life! People accumulate folly, failing to early learn the true Dao, the extraordinary methods of goodness and virtue, dismissing them as trivial. They do not know their transgressions accumulate greatly, disrupting Heaven and Earth and bringing sorrow to their emperor. Their bodies yet meet death by Heaven’s decree, failing to complete their allotted years before perishing.

Perfected One, reflect deeply upon my written words. Is there any transgression in the world greater than this death?"
"Excellent! Excellent! This foolish one has now fully awakened."

"Have you, by awakening early, become one who comprehends matters and life, drawing near to fortune while distancing misfortune? Yet if one awakens but does not persist, is the true Dao ever fully attained? Is gaining the favor of kings and lords not inferior to encountering an immortal? Now, if you come upon a thousand pounds of gold or ten thousand pairs of jade discs, is that not less valuable than finding an enlightened teacher? Though an emperor may have countless foolish ministers, is one great sage not worth more? Though parents may bear a hundred unworthy sons, is one virtuous son not better? Though a village of a hundred households may neglect study, is residing near one of great virtue not preferable? Though ten thousand eyes may strain, is one great guiding principle not superior? Though the world teems with chaos and all things exist, is any of it not surpassed by Heaven alone—divine and sagely, riding qi to soar through the skies? Though things may be many, is any not inferior to the single qi that alone sustains life?

Thus, I now command the Perfected One and all learners: swiftly cast aside superficial adornments, devote yourselves to essential matters, and seek the true Dao. Does one who desires supreme fortune not emulate Heaven? Heaven and Earth, free of affliction, remain eternally joyful—does the true Dao, with its wondrous and extraordinary methods, not emerge to protect humanity? Therefore, the sages of antiquity constantly emulated Heaven, never daring to slacken, and so they alone were perpetually fortunate. When worthy scholars gather their strategies, the Dao of Heaven is complete. Each speaks of one good, and yin and yang are ordered; the spirits rejoice. Disasters and harms all lie subdued, never to arise again. This is what it means to govern in accord with Heaven’s will, so that treacherous ministers vanish. How divine is the Dao—it is the art of spontaneity itself!"

"Excellent! Excellent! This foolish one previously did not exert himself in inquiry and thus had no means to know these truths."

"Indeed, your words are correct. If one studies but does not exert effort in inquiry, how can daily progress be made? If one walks but does not frequently move one’s feet, how can the Way be reached? If one studies but does not find an enlightened teacher, how can understanding be awakened? If one governs a state and desires peace and stability, yet does not employ great worthies, how can order be achieved in a single day?"

"Excellent are the Celestial Master’s words!"

"Indeed, you have glimpsed the subtle intent. Thus, ninefold walls of a golden fortress are not equal to serving one great worthy. Therefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity all served enlightened teachers to resolve their cares and troubles. Thus, sages and worthies all had their teachers and methods. Perfected One, take heed: in all matters, cherish yourself, for the gates of fortune and misfortune may be seen!

"Perfected One, heed this one word."

"Yes, yes."

"What people seek and obtain, Heaven grants in accord with their seeking, never failing them. Do not wait until death’s approach to weep to Heaven and wail to Earth. This is called obtaining what one has sought for oneself, then turning to blame Heaven and Earth—such a one is called a great rebel. Heaven does not favor them, Earth does not delight in them, and ghosts and spirits will not protect them. Those who suffer grievances alone bear their grievances; those who seek and do not obtain have only themselves to blame."

"Yet all things obtain what they seek—why should one bring grievance upon oneself?"

"Perfected One, ponder deeply my words: are they true or not? My writings do not err. They are greatly... [lacuna], not missing even one in ten thousand. Now, Heaven detests and swiftly punishes such errors, so I reiterate the Dao. Though I have spoken of this above, I again admonish the Perfected One below. Thus, I deliberately cause later generations to rejoice repeatedly, to deeply ponder, admire, reflect upon, transmit, and transcribe these words, sharing them without concealment. These are Heaven’s admonitory writings, meant to be seen and propagated, not to be hidden."

"Yes, yes."

"Go now."

Here the collected queries address whether the dead encounter grievance, whether their desires are fulfilled, whether their fate aligns with the nation’s safety, and whether their learning meets with enlightened masters or unworthy teachers.

*Tai Ping Jing* Collated and Annotated, Scroll 91, Ji Section 6
*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 91: "Collating and Verifying the Three Ancient Texts," Chapter 132

**Opening:**
"Permit me to ask: the Celestial Master’s writings collate and verify all texts since the opening of Heaven and Earth—those of past and present sages, the river charts and Luo scripts, divine writings, and even the words of common folk, servants, and distant barbarians. They gather all extraordinary phrases and rare strategies, uniting them into a single discourse to clarify the Dao of Heaven. Is this not laborious?"

"It is precisely because distant matters are cumbersome and inaccessible that each is addressed where it arises, seeking the abode of Great Peace within its own domain—town or village. Those in charge prepare for what lies afar but cannot attain it themselves. Thus, I establish stations along the Way, where they may submit unusual words, excellent strategies, and singular methods. From these, the central affairs are selected and conveyed to a ruler of virtue above, whose ministers jointly examine and categorize them. The finest are chosen, their heterodox phrases removed, to form the *Dongji Jing* (*Scripture of the Penetrating Ultimate*), named *Celestial Governance of the Penetrating Ultimate*. Thereafter, the ailments of Heaven and Earth are entirely dispelled. The governance of emperors and kings attains perfect great peace, and the accumulated calamities of ten thousand generations are wholly eradicated. Then, the myriad things and spirits will have nothing to report, nor will they again accuse humanity’s evils before the Highest Heaven. Therefore, those charged with collation and verification are Heaven’s envoys, sent to deliver my words below. Though laborious, how could one not exert every effort?

All writings under Heaven, though each person speaks but one word—or ten or more—resolve all doubts across the world without undue burden. Each simply remains in their place, speaking and conveying their words upward. This is called gathering the world’s words into a shared discourse, to penetrate the intent of Heaven and Earth, to harmonize the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, to eliminate the disasters of emperors and kings, and to benefit the common people and all things, each finding their proper place. Only then will Heaven and Earth be wholly and greatly joyful. Their ailments wholly dispelled, their joy will protect emperors and kings, allowing them to wander at leisure without concern."

"I wish to ask: why does Heaven and Earth at this time command the people of the world to collectively gather words, strategies, and the writings of ancient and modern divine sages to form the *Dongji Jing*?"

"Excellent is your question. Indeed, Heaven and Earth suffer from severe disorder and illness, never having attained proper governance. Thus, they instruct humanity to convene and jointly produce correct words and extraordinary strategies to cure their ailments. Hence, they command this great gathering of words and affairs."

"I further wish to ask: when Heaven and Earth are in chaos and afflicted with severe illness, why not instead bring forth good sages? What use is it to repeatedly produce later sages?"

**Closing:**
"Alas! How foolish you are, Perfected One!"

"I have heard that this has been spoken of before."
"The lowly and benighted are born, accumulating ignorance and obstinacy, unable to perceive clearly."
"If even you, Perfected One, speak thus, how can the common people possibly understand? They will surely cast aside my words in mutual resentment, and greater celestial disasters will arise, beyond remedy. Thus, Heaven has made you ask repeatedly. Does it wish me to explain further in full?"
"Very well. I have witnessed the mandate myself, descending for this matter. I dare not conceal anything or defy Heaven. Come, Perfected One, listen closely. I shall elucidate for you point by point, expounding fully from beginning to end. Simply sit in peace."
"Understood."

"Come, the sages of past and present differ in excellence, each excelling in one domain. All speak the language of Heaven and Earth, yet their works vary. Thus, the many sages who have appeared before and after pursue different paths. All delight in aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth, eliminating evil and achieving goodness, yet their words are not entirely alike—some align, some do not, though broadly similar. Therefore, the multitude of sages cannot fully grasp the intent of Heaven and Earth. Hence, Heaven and Earth often suffer from severe ailments that are not entirely cured, and even if more sages were born, the outcome would be the same. Heaven has long been disheartened. Thus, it sent me down to fully articulate these words and convey them to you, Perfected One. The reason I address you, Perfected One, is that the gods above have declared: among those below who delight in goodness and seek to accord with Heaven’s will, only you, Perfected One, exist."
Thus, I convey the truth of these words to you, Perfected One. I do not speak empty words. Do you understand?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have grasped it yourself."
"Come, the reason for compiling the divine texts of the high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity is this: what the divine texts of high antiquity did not address, the divine texts of middle antiquity did; what the divine texts of middle antiquity did not address, the divine texts of recent antiquity did. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse. Thus, they are gathered together. Thereafter, the intent of Heaven and Earth in the divine books may be discerned. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have comprehended it. Come, what the sages of high antiquity lost, the sages of middle antiquity gained; what the sages of middle antiquity lost, the sages of recent antiquity gained; what the sages of recent antiquity lost, the sages of high antiquity gained. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse of the sages. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you may be said to have achieved great understanding. Come, when the great sages err or fall short, the middling sages attain it; when the middling sages err, the lesser sages attain it. Again, arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse of the sages. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have comprehended it. Come, when the great worthies err or fall short, the middling worthies attain it; when the middling worthies err, the lesser worthies attain it. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse of the worthies. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you may be said to have achieved great understanding. Come, when emperors and kings lose it, ministers and sons attain it; when ministers and sons lose it, the common people attain it. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have achieved great understanding. Come, when the aged lose it, those in their prime attain it; when those in their prime lose it, the young attain it. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have comprehended it. Come, when men lose it, women attain it; when women lose it, servants, bondmaids, and barbarians attain it. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have understood it. Come, sometimes the writings of high antiquity lose it, while those of middle antiquity attain it; sometimes the writings of middle antiquity lose it, while those of recent antiquity attain it. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have achieved great understanding. Come, sometimes the people of high antiquity lose it, while those of middle antiquity attain it; sometimes the people of middle antiquity lose it, while those of recent antiquity attain it. Arranging them by category to complement one another, they form a single excellent discourse. Do you understand?"
"Understood."

"Come, you have comprehended it. Come, sometimes the high lose it while the low attain it; sometimes the low lose it while the high attain it; sometimes both high and low lose it while the middle attain it; sometimes the middle lose it while both high and low attain it. Sometimes the writings of celestial spirits lose it, while the writings of sages attain it; sometimes the writings of sages lose it, while the writings of worthies attain it; sometimes the writings of worthies lose it, while the writings of the common people attain it; sometimes the writings of the common people lose it, while the barbarians attain it. Sometimes the inner loses it while the outer attains it; sometimes the outer loses it while the inner attains it. Where there is loss, there is also attainment. Thus, whether high or low, outer or inner, noble or base, distant or near, gather their writings and essential sayings, collect their strengths and shortcomings, arrange them by category to complement one another, and all will be complete. Then the written records and spoken words will be entirely comprehensive. Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Now act upon it, for you have already understood. Heaven and Earth give birth to all matters, to people, sages, and the myriad creatures—each has its strengths and weaknesses, each has what it lacks, each has what it loses. Thus, what they do and create differs in myriad ways, yet in their essential aims, all desire to attain the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth and find peace for themselves.

Yet in that moment, each claims its own way as right, each holds its own truth as absolute. And in doing so, all stray from the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth. Thus, there is always an excess of disasters and harms, now great, now small, flowing ceaselessly—this is the clear proof. Therefore, the burden of *chengfu* is borne, and the suffering of later generations grows ever more severe.

Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood."

"Go forth, for you have already grasped it. Thus, now Heaven has sent me down to re-examine the teachings of literature and instruction as the Dao Lord of Supreme Virtue, and I have gathered them all together. From the words of spirits and sages down to the common people, slaves, and barbarians, I have arranged them by category, compiling their sayings. The good are made into the *Dongji* scriptures, named *The Writings of August Heaven’s Governance of the Utmost Extremes*. Thereafter, the illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be entirely eradicated.

Do you understand, Perfected One?"
"Understood. How excellent! How excellent!"

"Go forth, Perfected One, for you have now awakened to the arising of affairs and already comprehend them. Heaven has granted you longevity and raised you to the rank of Upper Perfected One."

"Unworthy, unworthy."

"You have attained this by your own conduct, not by my power. You have done good, and none in the world can compare, thus Heaven cherishes you."

"Unworthy, unworthy. This foolish one has only refrained from angering Heaven, nothing more can be hoped for."

"Do not be discontented."

"Understood, understood. [Rises] I venture to ask: in gathering these various categories to arrange them together, I wish to hear the essential meaning."

"Good! Well asked! Has Heaven indeed prompted you to ask this? Very well. Be seated, and I shall distinguish and explain the Dao for you."

"Understood, understood."

"Consider this: suppose we take the character *jia* as an example—this represents one matter. When presented before the multitude of worthy and enlightened ones, it becomes fitting for the written records of the world, the words of all people. Each has their own sayings. Among these, take the faultless writings, the faultless words, and select the most excellent, gathering those that first resolve the hearts of the multitude. By mutually verifying and illuminating them, what arises in accord with the hearts of people is also in accord with the heart of Heaven and Earth."

"How is this made clear? I wish to hear the essential method."

"Very well. In all human conduct, when examined in the heart and found to accord with the hearts of the multitude of worthy sages, and all declare it good, then its resonance immediately accords with the heart of Heaven. When examined in the heart and found doubtful, then compared with the hearts of the multitude of worthy sages, down to the hearts of petty people, and all declare it not good, this is inauspicious. Heaven ultimately responds to it with inauspiciousness—this is the clear proof. Thus, gathering these sayings to form the scriptures, what unites the hearts of people is right; what does not unite the hearts of people is wrong. Do you understand?"

"Understood, understood."

"Go forth. In all written records and all affairs, each has its root. Following the root and harmonizing the words of the multitude of literati, explaining them in this way—what accords with the hearts and minds of people also accords with the spirits and deities. What does not accord with the hearts and minds of people does not accord with the spirits and deities."

"Excellent! Excellent! Your instruction has been received."

"Why now, Perfected One, do you say 'instruction has been received'?"

"Indeed, when conduct is good and upright, one gains the heart of Heaven and lives. When conduct is evil, one loses the heart of Heaven and meets an inauspicious death. This life and death belong to the decree of fate. Thus, I say 'instruction has been received.'"

"Excellent! The Perfected One speaks truly. I have nothing to add."

Thus, when Heaven rectifies one’s words and writings, there is good fortune; when it does not rectify them, there is misfortune. This is why I instruct the Perfected One to examine and correct them.

“Indeed, indeed.”

Only then does the qi of the Grand Supreme August One arise and extend life come forth. Yet even the words of celestial texts and sagely writings vary in length. Therefore, the qi of the Grand Supreme August One, imprisoned by perverse phrases and erroneous speech, has never been able to arrive. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, there has never been a time when the qi of the Grand Supreme August One came to assist emperors and kings in governance.

Now, Heaven desires to fully release it, and so examines and corrects written works. For every perverse word that remains, there is one lingering illness; for every perverse doctrine or erroneous text that remains, there is one lingering illness. Ten perverse words leave ten illnesses, a hundred leave a hundred, a thousand leave a thousand, ten thousand leave ten thousand—each following these residual perverse words, perverse texts, and erroneous phrases to become illness. Heaven and Earth are afflicted by them, and thus cause people to be afflicted as well. If people are free of illness, then Heaven is free of illness; if half of the people are ill, then half of Heaven is ill; if all people, great and small, are ill, then all of Heaven is ill. Thus, when people fall ill, it is to awaken their joy; yet if they do not awaken, they die in countless numbers.

[End]

[Addendum]
I ask: when the multitude of categories are harmonized and aligned, then rectifying one’s words brings good fortune, while failing to rectify them brings misfortune. Only then does the qi of the Grand Supreme August One swiftly arrive.

When people fall ill, they all wish to quickly correct themselves for the better. When Heaven and Earth are ill, they too wish to quickly correct themselves for the better.

“I wish to hear: how do perverse words, perverse phrases, and perverse texts cause Heaven to fall ill?”

“Alas! Why do you remain so benighted and foolish? Sit properly, and I will explain it to the Perfected One.

When perverse words and perverse texts are used to expound the Dao and the scriptures, they disorder the Dao and the classics. When the Dao and the classics are disordered, the celestial patterns and earthly principles are disordered. When the celestial patterns and earthly principles are disordered, Heaven and Earth fall ill. Thus, the Three Luminaries, winds and rains, the four seasons, and the Five Agents engage in constant strife, and the year becomes inauspicious. Emperors and kings grow anxious and distressed, the government falls into chaos, and the people suffer from resentment, hunger, and cold—is this not the illness caused by perverse texts and perverse words? If they are widely employed, they lead to great disorder and ungovernability.

Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

When perverse texts, perverse words, and erroneous phrases are used to govern the state, day by day they bring disorder. When such perverse words, perverse phrases, and erroneous texts deceive the ears, the state falls into peril, ministers distort the law and act recklessly, and the people suffer hardship and poverty, all together defiling the governance of Heaven and Earth. The celestial officials grow furious, and their daily admonitions never cease; the people’s weeping and cries of injustice likewise never cease.

Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

When perverse words, perverse texts, and erroneous phrases are used to govern the household, fathers and sons, husbands and wives fall into disorder, growing to hate one another, and their constant quarrels never cease, thus becoming a household of misfortune. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

How grave this is! Hearing the Celestial Master’s words, I am truly terrified and alarmed. My foolish self did not reflect deeply and did not realize that such evil brings this upon us.

“You, Perfected One, have been foolish for far too long. The common people regard these as trifling matters and do not cast them aside, yet they do not know that these perverse words, perverse phrases, and perverse texts are the great adversaries of Heaven and Earth, the great bandits of the state, and the fierce ghosts of the hundred clans. How can they not be wholly cast out and strenuously eradicated? Therefore, Heaven cherishes the ruler of supreme virtue, fearing that he may not awaken, and that this great calamity may befall him. Thus, it has sent me down to expound upon this in full. Perfected One, swiftly commit these words to writing and disseminate them, so that he may urgently ponder the will of Heaven and thereby secure his own peace. If he does not, Heaven’s wrath will never cease. Thus, Heaven no longer sends sagely men to speak, for even they cannot entirely eliminate this affliction. Therefore, it causes all under Heaven to speak with one voice and together examine the ancient texts. Now, Heaven’s accumulated fury and resentment are directed at these perverse words, perverse texts, isolated speeches, and solitary flattering phrases. If you, Perfected One, wish to understand this, it is comparable to the emperor’s anger when the barbarians repeatedly come to harm his people. Thus, he dispatches a million soldiers to strike them down. If the affliction does not cease, his wrath will not subside. If the rewards for merit do not assuage his anger, the emperor will reconsider. Now, the examination of perverse texts is like this. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“How awe-inspiring—all under Heaven is now rectified!”
“Perfected One, you may indeed be said to understand! Now, these solitary phrases, these isolated perverse words and perverse texts—Heaven and Earth regard them as the greatest grievance, the greatest enemy of the emperor. From them arises all disorder, all unrest in governance. Therefore, they must now be severed: let all utterances, all doctrines, all memorials be gathered and examined to settle and secure affairs. Only then will the qi of Heaven at last be wholly restored to its proper place, and perverse words and perverse phrases at last wholly eradicated—utterly destroyed. From this day forward, Heaven will cause men to examine them, and the spirits will also proceed to examine them. There will be no respite, no moment of slackening—only unrelenting urgency. Do you understand?”
“Indeed, indeed. This humble student is deeply ●.”
“If you understand ●, you may be spared further examination.”
“Indeed, indeed. This humble student falls short in every matter and bears grave transgressions before Heaven and Earth, causing the Heavenly Master concern. I have already taken heed of these perverse texts and perverse phrases, the words of solitary men. Now, I humbly request to receive further admonitions and strictures, the utmost warnings that accompany the arrival of rectified texts.”
“Excellent! The written word has now matched the spoken.”

“Why do you ask again of your own accord?”
“This benighted one remains obstinate and dull—though my heart seeks clarity, I still fail to grasp it. If I do not repeatedly receive your enlightening admonitions, I remain in murky confusion, risking further disorder to the Heavenly Master’s Dao. That is why I dare not refrain from asking again.”
“Excellent, your words. Very well, be seated, and I shall expound fully for all the assembled Perfected Ones.”

*[The discourse begins:]*
Now, true words, true texts, and true phrases are the very root of Heaven and Earth, the treasured vessel and parents of the state’s peace, and the source from which all people and the myriad things receive their mandate. Thus, one must strive with all one’s might to rectify them.
*[The discourse ends.]*

“Indeed, indeed. I wish to hear in full how true words, true texts, and true phrases serve as the root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel, and the decisive mandate for all people and the myriad things.”
“Ah! You have heard these words repeatedly, Perfected One. In my writings, all is afflicted with the sickness of frivolous, perverse speech—why then do you ask again?”
“This humble student has followed the common ways, accumulating ignorance over time. I do not know where perversity ends, and thus I must repeatedly receive your strict and clear explanations, for I remain utterly perplexed.”
“Very well. If you wish to know the truth of the matter: when common people all speak of goodness and strive together to practice it, yet disasters persist without cease, it is because perverse texts and perverse words have caused the disorder. When common people say, ‘This will suffice,’ yet cannot achieve goodness, but by adhering to and practicing it, they instead align with Heaven, and disasters daily recede—this is the work of true texts, true words, and true phrases, which alone inwardly correspond with Heaven, manifesting the clear proof of Heaven and Earth’s intent. Thus, true words and true texts reveal the rectified heart of Heaven and Earth.

Therefore, when all speech is true, all texts are true, and all phrases are true, and the emperor adheres to and practices them, extending this to the lowest of the people, none will fail to delight in practicing rectitude. Heaven and Earth will then achieve great rectitude, the four seasons and five phases, and the myriad things, all at once, will each attain their proper place. The sun, moon, and three luminaries will uphold their measures, each attaining rectitude. The state will enjoy great peace without care, and this will reach even the spirits, who will bestow the formula for agelessness. Marvelous things and auspicious responses will all emerge, while treacherous deceit and malevolent omens will be utterly destroyed. The people will each preserve their households and complete their allotted years, and the myriad things will all attain long life and fulfillment, each in its proper season. This is the great and luminous efficacy of true words, true texts, and true phrases—as the root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel and parents, and the mandate of the people and the myriad things. Do you understand, Perfected One?”
“Indeed, indeed. How ● it is!”

“How wondrous! The root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel—its mandate lies precisely here!”

“Excellent. You may be called one who understands matters, for you have grasped it. Thus did Heaven send me down to examine and rectify all things. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, those who practice the true Way and speak true words in true texts—Heaven and Earth have ever rejoiced greatly in them, and thus they are ever blessed. Those who practice the perverse Way and speak perverse words in perverse texts—Heaven and Earth have ever been enraged and displeased by them, and thus they are ever inauspicious and unstable, often facing peril and ruin.

The common folk do not recognize this as the great affliction of Heaven and Earth, yet it disrupts the governance of emperors and kings. The benighted scholars below, in their cunning craft, compose treatises and records, practicing perverse words and perverse texts to vie for superiority, to deceive their superiors, to defile Heaven’s true Dharma, and to disorder Heaven’s true rites. This is the great grievance of Heaven, the great fault of Earth, and the great treachery against the state.”

“Now, having incurred the grievance of Heaven, the fault of Earth, and the treachery against the state, yet daily practicing such things—how could governance ever be peaceful? Today, the Celestial Master condemns these perverse words and perverse texts—how severe is their crime?”

“Alas! Perfected One, are you truly so foolish? When people together employ perverse words and perverse texts to disorder Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth are thus constantly afflicted—is this not the grievance and fault of Heaven? It is like one who constantly harms others—would they not also incur their grievance and fault?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Thus, it is clear that this is the grievance of Heaven and the fault of Earth. Now, perverse words, perverse texts, and perverse phrases have already deceived their superiors and endangered the state. Their governance constantly loses the favor of Heaven, their lifespans do not increase, and those who perish because of this are many, not just one. Is this not the great disgrace of the state? Do you, Perfected Ones, understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“In later ages, people are often foolish—some observe the celestial patterns yet speak contrary to them. Such words are nothing less than the chief instigators of treason against the state, the greatest grievance of Heaven and Earth, the gravest harm to the people, and the fiercest demonic forces among the ten thousand things. Virtuous ruler, be vigilant and never adopt such words. Those who employ them incur Heaven’s resentment and stray from rectitude. You must weigh deeply and plan far ahead, reflecting on their perils and harms to secure lasting peace. Heaven has bestowed special favor upon you, virtuous ruler, and thus has composed these teachings to ensure your safety and the preservation of your state. Do you, Perfected Ones, understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go forth, for you have now attained great awakening. Be ever cautious, be ever cautious—Heaven’s majesty must not be transgressed.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Let this be a warning to you, Perfected Ones: henceforth, the virtuous ruler shall carefully examine and ponder the celestial teachings and celestial patterns. When receiving memorials jointly submitted by the three ranks of officials and commoners, by the eighth month, gather and collate them, dividing them into three sections. The initial collation shall take place in the eastern hall of the ruler’s palace—this shall be the first transmission. The subsequent collation shall be conducted in the southern hall—this shall be the second transmission.”

“Transmit and collate in the western hall of the ruler—this shall be the third transmission. Those who have completed the collation shall depart to the northern hall of the ruler.”

“Why must the collators be stationed in separate halls and not observe one another’s work? We wish to understand.”

“Even so, if they were to see one another, deceit might arise, and falsehoods could be concealed, leading to further fraud. Such resentment would provoke Heaven and Earth, becoming the greatest scourge to the state. Heaven and Earth despise such men, and thus the Emperor governs disorder. Therefore, they are kept apart, and the three collations are conducted to verify the truth together. This resolves the will of Heaven and secures the governance of the king.”

“Why must the first collation begin in the eastern hall?”

“The East is where the qi of Heaven holds its intent and benevolence. Those who collate the origins of affairs must apply careful consideration, exerting effort in benevolence to align with Heaven and Earth, ever mindful of stabilizing the Emperor’s rule—hence the East. The benevolent proceed with action, and thus must scrutinize clearly, which is why the transmission moves to the southern hall of the ruler. After scrutiny, judgments are made with righteousness, removing what must be removed. Those with merit are recorded as such, and those without merit are likewise noted, forming a record of conduct. These records are then stored in the northern hall, placed in a secluded chamber, so that the deeds of all under Heaven—knowing good and evil—are never lost. Thus, the virtuous ruler examines conduct, and this is called the great divine person, who sits and knows the hearts of all under Heaven, as well as every movement of change and anomaly. Do you Perfected Ones understand?”

“How profound!”

“How profound indeed!”

“If you understand and revere the discourse of Heaven, you shall live long.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“From this point onward, officials no longer need speak of conduct records, for conduct records are manifest in this very system, and thus this shall serve as the record of conduct. Therefore, the virtuous ruler may rest his head upon his pillow in peace, without worry. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“When Heaven commands the review of documents, if a single matter is omitted, thirty lashes shall be administered; if ten matters are omitted, three hundred lashes; if a hundred matters are omitted, three thousand lashes. The virtuous ruler shall dismiss such a person and bar them from office forever. This individual treats matters with frivolity—such is the resentment of Heaven and the blame of Earth, the great thief of the state. Resentment, blame, and thievery cannot long be endured in governance; they will surely provoke Heaven and Earth, and thus must be swiftly removed.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Let me caution you, Perfected Ones, of one great essential: my written Dao flows from above to below without end. Those who cherish upright speech, upright words, and upright texts—I am deeply entrusted by Heaven to descend with this charge. Truly, Heaven cherishes upright speech, upright words, and upright texts, and thus detests with great vehemence perverse speech, perverse words, and perverse texts. It is precisely because Heaven and Earth abhor such resentment and blame that they have commanded me to descend and review, to remove this resentment, blame, and thievery, so as to pacify the state of virtue and power, and to dissolve the long-accumulated karmic retribution since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Let all harm depart and rest be attained, that the upright *qi* may fully advance and govern. Only then will the six directions, the eight distant realms, and the balanced *qi* of August Heaven all arrive in unison. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Thus, my texts are purely the words of Heaven, without deviation from their singular allotment. Heaven detests perverse texts, and so I detest them; Heaven cherishes upright texts, and so I cherish them.

Therefore, in my practice of the Dao, I wholly uphold the root, guard the center, and discard the branches. Heaven upholds the root, and so I uphold the root; Heaven guards the center, and so I guard the center; Heaven discards the branches, and so I discard the branches. My texts are thus of one body, one mind, one will, one allotment, one principle, one love, one aversion, one Dao, and one path with Heaven and Earth. Therefore, when the virtuous ruler employs them, there is not a single error. For ten thousand myriad ages they cannot be abandoned—only days of radiant clarity, with no time of darkness; only days of order, with no time of chaos; only days of goodness, with no time of evil; only days of fortune, with no time of misfortune. Thus it is called the ‘Utmost Correct Dao of Heaven’s Profound Extremity,’ embracing the heart of Heaven and Earth. Those who attain its highest secret may attain longevity; those who attain its middle secret become pillars of the state; those who attain its lowest secret may always dwell in peace.”

Here ends my brief discourse. If you have doubts, return again to ask.

“Indeed, indeed.”

“May I ask: if one inadvertently omits or errs in a single matter without cause, should they receive thirty strokes of the cane as punishment?”

“Excellent is your question, child! Has Heaven prompted your words? Indeed, numbers begin with one and end at ten. This error of omission in one matter thus concerns the very root of the One. Omission and error, if not truthful, become deceit—and deceit becomes Heaven’s resentment and Earth’s reproach, a great thief against the state. Ten strokes are to make amends to Earth; ten strokes, to make amends to the Emperor and Kings. Heaven, Earth, and humankind each receive ten, totaling thirty. These strokes atone for the transgression, dispelling Heaven’s resentment, Earth’s reproach, and the theft against the Emperor and Kings. Thus do Heaven and Earth rejoice, while the spirits’ wrath subsides.

The reason Heaven and Earth are often in turmoil and the spirits grow wrathful lies in the failure to verify documents and the prevalence of careless, erroneous speech—hence the succession of calamities and the burden of inherited misfortune. If such carelessness persists, punishment is warranted—not because of personal favor, but to rectify the matter.

Now, when deliberations are held and the facts are verified [for the upper record], it is marked as correct above; if further deliberations confirm [the lower record], it is marked as correct below. Thus, both upper and lower records are deemed true. If only the lower [record] is verified while the upper remains false, it is utterly without benefit; likewise, if only the upper [record] is verified while the lower remains false, it is also without benefit. Only when both upper and lower are true does Heaven’s qi attain balance.

If the lower is true but the upper is false, the upper wrongs the lower, and the lower wrongs itself—no good deed bears fruit, and Heaven’s wrath arises anew. If the upper is true but the lower is false, the lower wrongs the upper, and Earth’s wrath arises anew. Only when both upper and lower are entirely true, yet the Emperor and Kings do not govern with impartial reason, do the spirits of the four seasons, five phases, six relations, and the qi of the six ancestral temples grow restless, and inauspicious qi resurges. Even if one strives to circulate documents through the Three Dao to rectify the realm’s words and texts, without earnestly governing with impartiality, it is of no avail.

Therefore, I uphold Heaven’s will, enacting transformation for the August Virtuous Ruler of the Highest Sovereignty, never daring to stray from Heaven’s heart. Thus, I fully adhere to Heaven’s laws, taking the images of Heaven and Earth as the warp, following the yang as the standard, and aligning with the four seasons and five phases as the mandate—unchanging for ten thousand generations. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“I, your humble student, have now awakened with reverence and hold the laws of Heaven in great awe.”

“Since you know to stand in awe of them, you have already secured lasting auspiciousness. This is a crucial admonition for the Perfected One. Now, regarding the collation of documents and laws: one must not merely assert that the numinous texts match their written forms, claiming this as truth—such is called ‘deaf script.’ Does speech truly lack a root or handle? Why would one speak thus? It does not restrain what exists. One must inquire into the intent behind the words; only when the intent is grasped can the matter be clarified. If the intent is not explained, how can it be understood? Therefore, one must question its resolution and meaning; otherwise, it cannot be employed—this is called ‘deaf governance.’

If you wish to delight in understanding intent, consider this: when a person speaks, there must be a foundation, a source from which it arises. One cannot simply say, ‘Eastern Duke spoke thus to establish the matter.’ All who testify to establish matters possess roots—how could they merely fabricate empty, baseless words? Thus, in all ordinary affairs, one must rely on actual evidence before a matter can be established.

Do you wish to know its great efficacy and clear proof? Consider how I, for the Virtuous Ruler, enact transformative laws—all are tested and verified in practice. If implemented and no response follows, it is false speech; if implemented and no response follows, it is contrary to Heaven. True speech and writing are like this. How can one idly establish proof and speak words without explanation?

Foolish people may stubbornly insist, ‘Why are the numinous texts and words like this?’—using them only as phrases to resolve difficulties and evade inquiry. What power do numinous texts possess? They may have intent, but merely transmitting their words without residing in a single volume, passing them along in isolation, people fail to deeply grasp their essential meaning. Instead, they use them to deflect difficulties, citing ‘Eastern Duke said long ago’ to justify themselves—this is false. All such cases lose the true intent. That the words of the Dao and virtue fail to circulate widely stems entirely from this.

Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed. Your humble student has now awakened with reverence.”

“If you had remained unaware in this way, you would have fallen into delusion. Therefore, when examining my writings, scrutinizing texts and human speech, one must thoroughly inquire into their intent. By what means can their meaning be obtained? By gathering them according to kind. Only then will the texts and words of the world, once fully explored, reveal the laws of Heaven’s Dao, and the words of good and evil be made clear.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Go forth—my Dao is revealed here. Perfected One, reflect upon it again and again, mutually verifying and clarifying, and nothing will remain unresolved. All matters under Heaven will be complete, the Great Dao attained, Heaven and Earth pleased, and the Virtuous Ruler eternally secure. The world will speak with one voice, all saying, ‘Excellent!’ No longer will they speak of Heaven’s governance, for the hearts of Heaven and Earth will be regained—this is called peace. When all actions align with the hearts of ordinary people, the world will have no further words.

Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go. If minor discrepancies in the words leave you in doubt, return to ask again.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Herein lies the text of *The Scripture of the Cavernous Ultimate* on the harms of Heaven’s resentment, Earth’s reproach, and the state’s calamities. *Collated and Combined Scroll Ninety-Two of the* Classic of Great Peace*, Ji Section, Part Seven. Scroll Ninety-Two of the* Classic of Great Peace*: The One Hundred Thirty-Third Formula on the Eclipses of the Three Luminaries.”

“May I ask why the Three Luminaries of Heaven sometimes suffer eclipse?”

“Excellent! An excellent question indeed. This is the great wrath of Heaven and Earth, their struggle and disharmony, manifest in the signs of the sun, moon, and stars. Yet eclipses may or may not occur—the fault lies in the struggle of yin and yang qi.”

“Why do they struggle?”

“Yin and yang engage in mutual trespass, each vying for dominance. By nature, yin and yang ought to benefit and aid one another, together forming harmonious qi. Instead, they contend, and all fault lies in this lack of harmony and balance.”

“If they were harmonious and balanced, would there be no eclipses?”

“Indeed. In the most excellent age of the Great Cavern of High Antiquity, eclipses never occurred. But as later generations grew increasingly distant, they collectively lost the intent of Heaven and Earth, causing yin and yang to gradually cease loving one another—thus leading to their struggle. You may doubt my words, but if the Virtuous Ruler were to examine and enact my text, grasping its full meaning, the struggle would cease.”

“If one grasps a small portion of its meaning, the struggle ceases in small measure; if half its meaning is attained, it ceases by half. Yet if one does not vigorously enact it, one remains mired in distress.”

Someone asked: “When do the eclipses of the sun and moon occur due to the convergence of celestial movements?”

“Alas! How foolish you are! Even a Perfected One would only provoke Heaven’s wrath by raising such a question. How could you, a mere mortal, claim to know of celestial movements?”

“The unenlightened see only that they occupy the same space.”

“How benighted is your mind—so profoundly obscured! If we follow your reasoning, then indeed eclipses would be mere convergences of movements.”

“Then why, within a single year, do the sun and moon eclipse without resolution? Or why, in some years, do they not eclipse at all? How can celestial movements explain this? When emperors and kings abundantly practice the Dao and virtue, the sun and moon do not eclipse, and the stars do not disrupt their courses. How can this be? Moreover, by nature, yin and yang share the same realm and ought to love one another—why then do they harm each other? Yin and yang should alternately generate and bring each other to fruition—why instead do they turn to mutual destruction?”

“This is the folly of your ignorance. If you wish to know the truth, consider the analogy of men. When people have long been close but have not seen one another for some time, upon meeting again, they rejoice greatly, aiding and benefiting each other, praising and illuminating one another. But if they have never been close, upon suddenly meeting, they contend. If their estrangement is great, they fight to the death; if slight, they quarrel in small measure.”

“How terrifying! How terrifying!”

The fool has now understood. I ask: today the sun is the spirit of fire, of yang; the moon is the spirit of water, of yin. Now water and fire do not share the same realm, and when they meet by chance, they extinguish each other—what does this mean? Is it not because they are not close?

Excellent! Your words grasp the meaning. Yet water and fire each follow their own Dao, abide by their own courses, and when they harmonize, they establish merit and accomplish tasks. Consider the five phases: none can be absent, for all mutually generate and complete one another. If you wish to know the truth, compare them to the five viscera dwelling together in the human abdomen. The heart is fire, the kidneys are water—how could they share the same place yet daily engage in battle and mutual destruction? Do you now understand?

Indeed, indeed. The fool has awakened.

Thus, when the qi of harmony arrives, the Three Luminaries no longer contend or eclipse. Only when the Three Luminaries do not eclipse one another can one begin to speak of attaining the heart of Heaven and Earth, and this serves as proof. Therefore, if you wish to know your own worth, to practice virtue and the Dao, you must first observe this celestial evidence, rather than gathering mere texts that speak of mutual destruction in shared realms. Such records only preserve the words of mutual love, without deeply grasping their meaning. Even if divine texts exist, Heaven has not yet deeply revealed its true nature. Do you understand?

Indeed, indeed.

Go, you have now awakened. After my text is revealed, let virtuous emperors and kings ponder this celestial intent and not forget these words, for they are the means to attain the heart of Heaven. If one aligns with the intent of Heaven, one’s mandate will be long and whole; if not, it will disrupt the Gate of Destiny. To act without accord with the heart of Heaven is also a great peril. From the earliest antiquity, all sage emperors and kings have taken this as a warning, deeply inscribing my words in their hearts, so that subtle truths may be seen and the Dao attained. This I entrust to rulers of supreme virtue, to remedy the contention and eclipses of the Three Luminaries.

Indeed, indeed.

Go now, our brief discourse is complete. If you have doubts, return to ask again.

Indeed, indeed.

**The One Hundred and Thirty-Fourth Formula of the Twelve Thousand States: The Beginning of Fire and the Beginning of Qi**

Someone asked: "The world shares the same sun and moon, the same Dipper and Pole Star. One great division comprises twelve thousand states, the central division eighty-one regions, and each small division is a single state. Those of superior virtue expand their territory to twelve thousand *li*; the next, ten thousand *li*; then nine thousand, eight thousand, seven thousand, six thousand, five thousand, four thousand, three thousand, two thousand, one thousand, five hundred, and one hundred *li*. These are the lands of even and stable earth, where the expansion and preservation of territory depend on the superiority or inferiority of virtue. As for those of inferior virtue, they may possess not a single stretch of level land, all afflicted by calamities and transformations, causing the sun and moon of a single state to contend and eclipse. Among the twelve thousand states, would all necessarily suffer eclipse? If the Dipper and Pole Star grow dim, would all twelve thousand states necessarily lose their brightness?"

"Excellent! How profound, how distant, how subtle is your question! Why do you ask specifically about these strange and wondrous transformations? If one state undergoes change, what does it matter to the twelve thousand states? Should the others also be affected?"

"I found it strange and, not daring to presume upon the Heavenly Master’s wisdom, feared that without asking, the truth would remain unknown through all ages. Thus, I inquired."

"Excellent! Your doubt truly enters the Way. If one state undergoes change, only that state’s sun grows dim—this is called an eclipse. Neighboring states may observe it from afar, but the distant ones are certainly unaffected. If the Dipper and Pole Star grow dim, only those who have lost Heaven’s intent lose their brightness; the distant ones remain unobscured."

"Now I ask: what barrier or concealment causes this localized dimness?"

"Alas! You are still like an unopened child, no different from the common folk. Consider this: Heaven and Earth are separated by vast distance. In a state that has lost the Way and lacks virtue, perverse *qi* rises to obscure the sky. The Three Luminaries, each following their kind, ascend, but their light is dimmed. It is like a place shrouded in mist, where the Three Luminaries alone grow dim, while beyond the mist, all remains brightly lit. If you wish to understand further: in a shaded place, one does not see a lunar eclipse; in a sunlit place, one sees a solar eclipse. To confirm this truth, consider that in the current year, with Jupiter in the *zi* position, virtuous states alone enjoy prosperity, while those without virtue suffer misfortune. Though they share the same state and the same year, their fortunes differ. It is like people sharing the same Heaven and Earth, yet their safety or peril, their customs, are not the same. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Now, as the sun and moon move and shine, all twelve thousand states share them, yet where they are bright or dim differs. In states with the Dao and virtue, governance is pure and clear, tranquil and free from perversity—thus their Three Luminaries alone shine brightly, for the perverse *yin* *qi* below cannot rise to obscure them. Where they are dim, the fault lies below, where the lower deceive the higher, and perverse *qi* together ascends to veil what is above. In states without the Dao, governance is filthy and turbid, filled with treachery and self-deception—thus their Three Luminaries are dim.

Do you wish to confirm this further? It is like squinting at the sun versus gazing at it with eyes wide open; or like looking at the sun with eyes fully open versus through a thin veil of silk—this is precisely the case. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes! How astonishing! How astonishing!"

"If you grasp this astonishment, you attain long life."

"Yes, yes."

"As for those states on the verge of misfortune and decline, their Three Luminaries are entirely dim. It is like a blind man who alone cannot behold the brightness of the Three Luminaries—the Three Luminaries remain as they are, yet because the man is blind, he alone does not see them. It is like one in the prime of life who alone perceives the brightness of the Three Luminaries, while the aged alone cannot perceive it—this is the effect of their flourishing or decline. Do you fully understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Go now. I ask of one ultimate secret—what is it? And what, pray, is this 'One' that I do not yet clearly understand?"

"Ah! A true person clings to so many texts—why doubt this? Now you are lost in darkness. Know how to guard the One, and all matters are complete. Why do you ask such trifling questions? You should reflect on these words."

"Yes, yes."

"The One is the heart, the mind, the will. It is the spirit within this body. All affairs under heaven are accomplished through it. From ancient times to the present, the transformations of the worthy and the sagely—all their achievements and renown—are realized through this. For they knew early to study the heart and mind, to will and contemplate goodness, to guard virtuous deeds. Fools bring only misfortune upon themselves, for they study and guard evil deeds. The nature of heaven and earth is such that all crawling creatures are thus—therefore, if one follows a teacher’s instruction, longevity may be attained. What Dao is there to study? Heaven and earth may be grasped. Gathering a multitude of millions is not equal to serving one worthy person. A multitude of fools—millions of them—can only hasten misfortune and ruin. If one truly guards the body of a single worthy, what harm can come to oneself? If one cannot turn back and reflect, seeing one’s thoughts as if gazing into a mirror, then the will directed afar brings illness to the body, withering and decay in one’s affairs. But if the will is directed near, the body retains its luster. All that the will and thought accomplish are manifold—if one does not prepare and remember them, all affairs under heaven are thus. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

“〈Question〉 May I ask: when drought and frost cause all to perish, and the people suffer, starving and freezing to death—what is this killing?”

“This is the killing of August Heaven’s Great Yang. When the six yangs are all resentful, they are capable of bringing harm.”

“What does this mean? I wish to hear it.”

“It is this: the six directions reach their utmost extremes, and within them, the Great Hardness is all resentful toward people for their long-standing chaos and evil—hence the killing. What harm does it bring to people? It has no name. It merely encounters the exhaustion of their inherited burdens, and Heaven’s wrath erupts. It does not distinguish between people’s good and evil—those who encounter it face great misfortune. If you wish to know its truth, compare it to a person. When a person is enraged to the utmost, they may vent their fury upon the good, not sparing them, and instead harm others at random. Now, what fault have those others committed? Yet they encounter the person’s wrath. Heaven’s wrath erupts in the same way. Thus, the responsibility of inherited burdens is most severe, causing people to die without regard for good or evil. The great calamity lies here. 〈End〉

Therefore, my scripture responds to Heaven’s teaching, now seeking to sever once and for all the responsibility of inherited burdens. Heaven’s transgressions run deep and heavy, harming many innocent people—Heaven grieves over this greatly. Thus, it has instructed me to charge the Perfected Ones to transmit this scripture to a ruler of supreme virtue, commanding that wicked, deceitful, and false people be cut off, so that Heaven’s Dao may be ordered. Do you understand?”

“Yes, yes.”

“May I ask: since the opening of Heaven and Earth, some have perished entirely from raging epidemics, some from floods, and some from warfare. I wish to understand the reason—what offense have they committed? Is it merely the conjunction of Heaven and Earth? Or is it the distress of inherited burdens?”

“Indeed. Ancient and modern texts often attribute this to the meeting of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, but this is incorrect. All such calamities arise from the distress of inherited burdens. When Heaven’s qi is in harmony, but its anger flares, and spirits and deities engage in battle, those who die from raging epidemics are struck down by Heaven. Those who perish in floods are struck down by Earth. Those who die in warfare are struck down by humanity.”

“May I ask why those who die from raging epidemics are slain by Heaven?”

“Heaven presides as the sovereign of spirits and the chief of divine beings, thus it commands spirits and ghosts to kill. Earth is the humble aspect of yin; water is the most intense aspect of yin and belongs to Earth. Yin governs gestation. When any being in gestation is harmed, it must turn to blood, and blood is of the same kind as water. Those harmed during gestation become enraged and displeased, further spreading their polluted blood to harm others. Water is the bloodstream of Earth, the yin of Earth. Yin, being humble, when enraged, must engage in battle and kill with its own body—just as a minister sent to capture bandits must act in person, not like a ruler who merely issues commands from afar. Harmony is governed by humanity, while the four seasons and five phases share in its regulation. People ought to act in accord with harmony. When they lose the Dao and fail to follow it, they provoke wrath. Thus, the four seasons bring perverse qi, and the five phases engage in battle, causing people to attack one another. All this arises from Heaven and Earth’s harmony turning to anger and displeasure, accumulating over time into illness and sorrow, leading to such outcomes.”

“Excellent! Had I not pressed with these questions, I would never have come to know this.”

“Would that I might hear fully of this calamity of mutual burden and retribution, which arises from the wrath of the three qi. Yet when there is no such mutual burden and retribution, how do people die?”

“Indeed, all human life has its end. The high, the low, and the middling each fulfill their allotted years. Some attain the true Dao and thereby transcend the world—such people bear no burden of retribution, for this is the natural principle. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, I do.”

“Excellent! You grasp it well. As for those who die suddenly, one after another, none of these deaths are fated. They are but the effects of Heaven and Earth’s harmony, the four seasons, and the five phases waging war in wrathful suppression and slaughter.”

“Excellent! Excellent! Had I not pressed the Heavenly Master with these questions, I would have had no way to know this.”

“Thus, since the opening of Heaven and Earth, this calamity has always existed, though people have remained unaware. Now, deeply grieved by this suffering, I lament that so many die without guilt, moving Heaven to compassion. Therefore, Heaven has sent me down to explain it fully. Once my celestial texts are put into practice, the people and all things will each die according to their allotted lifespans, and there will be no more mass deaths.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Future generations will each fulfill their destinies. Do you, Perfected One, understand?”

“Indeed, I do.”

“You ask: if death does not come by the Dao of Heaven or the revolutions of fate, why then does it always arise at the junctures of Heaven and Earth, at the confluences of the five phases? Is it because the spirits of the Five Emperors have exhausted their cycles and fallen into distress?”

“Ah! Excellent! Such a probing question from the Perfected One! Has Heaven itself prompted you to ask this? Your words strike the very heart of celestial prophecy—what a singular and crucial inquiry! I am most delighted. Since you have spoken thus, I shall now set forth a detailed explanation for you.

All you Perfected Ones have come from afar to inquire on behalf of Heaven and Earth, to resolve doubts that have lingered since the opening of Heaven and Earth and the rise of emperors. You should sit calmly and listen to my words.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now, the law of Heaven and the reckoning of the people and the myriad things are thus: consider the qi of the four seasons, which ought only to succeed one another in generation and completion, passing along in turn. Consider human life: the young will in time grow old, succeeding one another in alternation. They ought not to engage in struggle and war, thereby cutting off and extinguishing the generations.

The reason the Dao wages war—bringing floods, droughts, pestilence, and mass death—is that the lord of men, following the ways of former kings and ancestors, gradually loses the intent of the Dao. Over time, this accumulates until the juncture arrives, and he fails to measure himself and act accordingly, thus bringing about total annihilation, leaving no remnant of the kind. Heaven, Earth, and humanity form the three norms, each depending on the others to stand, each shaping the others to completion. It is like a person with head, feet, belly, and body: if one norm is destroyed, the three norms all collapse in ruin. If a person lacks head, feet, or belly, and one is lost, then all three are imperiled.

Thus, when humanity greatly violates the great Dao, it brings ruin to Heaven and Earth, and the three norms perish. All becomes dark and confused, and the myriad things perish as a result. When things are utterly destroyed, they cannot suddenly regenerate. How much is lost? How much is extinguished? Sometimes recovery comes swiftly, sometimes great ruin endures for a long time before restoration is possible. Thus, minor destruction is quickly repaired.

If you wish to know the truth of this in greater detail, so that future virtuous rulers may clearly perceive the great effects of Heaven and Earth’s grievance, consider a household managing its livelihood: those with abundant stores, though they may encounter misfortune or suffer the burden of past transgressions in a year of poor harvest, will endure securely. A household with great stores, even if it suffers bad years in succession, will still survive. A household with modest stores, if it encounters years of poor harvest in succession, will starve to death. A perpetually impoverished household, if it suffers a single bad year, will perish entirely. It will fail to measure itself and act accordingly, and thus be trapped without recourse.

The Dao of Heaven has its established laws; its revolutions are not mere junctures. It is like summer and autumn, when one must exert effort to gather, and winter and spring, when one must live on what has been stored. If one does not diligently gather in summer and autumn, one will starve to death in winter and spring. The celestial texts of the ancients recorded this as the juncture of meeting and parting.

The Perfected One now understands it thus. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, there will be constant equilibrium, and there will be no more deaths at the junctures of the Dao.

Heaven commands the emperor to govern, and thus awakens the virtuous ruler. The common people, in following the Dao, must also glimpse and understand this. Had the people of former times consistently upheld the essential Dao and essential virtue, even if they had encountered such junctures, they would not have perished.

The law by which Heaven commands the emperor to govern the state holds that possessing the Dao and virtue is the greatest wealth, while lacking the Dao and virtue is the greatest poverty. Those who are called lacking in the Dao and virtue will be unable to stabilize Heaven and Earth and will lose them. Former rulers gradually abandoned and severed the Dao and virtue, accumulating over time until the burden was passed on, and later generations suffered its grievous poison and disasters, all because they governed without the Dao. When the revolutions brought annihilation, they could not extricate themselves—the great fault lies here.

Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“How dreadful! How dreadful!”

“Let me further enlighten you, Perfected One. The Dao and virtue are the true heart of Heaven. It is like a person having a heart: if the human heart faithfully guards the Dao, it will always be blessed with good fortune; if the human heart is wicked and does not guard the Dao, it will constantly decline into misfortune. When the spirit of the heart departs, death follows. Thus, when the essential Dao and virtue are severed, people die, and Heaven and Earth fall into chaos and ruin.

Therefore, the Dao makes Heaven, Earth, and humanity share the same concerns and the same tasks, enabling them to alternately generate and complete one another. If they do not share the same concerns and tasks, they will refuse to alternately generate and complete one another, and instead will worry for and benefit one another. Thus, the Dao and virtue bind them to share the same fate.

For this reason, when Heaven and Earth see people possessing the Dao and virtue and doing good, they rejoice greatly; when they see people doing evil, they become enraged. Do you understand, Perfected One?”

“Indeed, indeed. How dreadful! This foolish one is deeply afraid.”

“If you know to fear this, then you may attain long life without misfortune. If you do not know to fear it, then Heaven has already begun to turn away from you—you must be deeply cautious.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Let me further clarify this for you, Perfected One. The course of good and ill fortune is like the relationship between the Dao, virtue, ritual propriety, and punishments. If people uphold the Dao, virtue, and ritual propriety, then punishments will not arise. If they lose the Dao, virtue, and ritual propriety, then punishments will emerge.

Thus, those who guard the good Dao find the path of misfortune naturally severed; it departs without needing to be taught to leave. Those who guard the path of misfortune find the path of speech naturally severed. This is like the sun rising and the stars fleeing, or the stars appearing and the sun setting—they do not err by even a fraction.

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Now let me reveal a great secret to you, Perfected One. People today are deeply foolish and benighted, passing down warnings to one another that the cycles of time naturally bring good and ill fortune. If this is so, what benefit is there in doing good? What harm is there in doing evil? If the cycles of time are natural, what use is there in striving to do good?

Yet those who are sagely constantly align with the heart of Heaven, teaching people to do good—this is correct. To speak of the cycles of time and thereby disrupt the Dao of Heaven is a doctrine that causes Heaven and Earth to remain perpetually displeased. In truth, it is human conduct that brings these outcomes, yet people claim that the cycles of time are naturally adverse. Unwilling to admit their own evil, they instead accuse Heaven and Earth of being evil. It is like a wicked and unfilial child who, unwilling to admit his own faults, instead accuses his parents of being evil. Thus, Heaven is constantly pained, enraged, and sorrowful. Because of these cycles, it strikes down and contends with them, delighting in the transformation of their kind.

In the past, it was not merely a matter of following one another in succession—when the old departed, the young grew up, each exhausting their allotted lifespan and undergoing transformation. It is like the changes in human form since the opening of Heaven and Earth.”

“Excellent! This foolish one has gained great clarity on this: though the forms of people past and present differ, their *qi* is the same.”

“If you wish to know this more deeply, consider the *qi* of the four seasons and the positions of the Five Phases. Though their external manifestations differ, internally they share the same *qi*, alternately generating and completing one another. It is like the head and feet of a person, which do not resemble each other, yet internally they unite to form a single being.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Let me further enlighten you, Perfected One. When Heaven accumulates resentment because people do evil and then claim that the cycles of time are inauspicious, the *qi* of the Supreme August arrives. It should assist the virtuous ruler in governance, but I fear that the people of this age will not change their conduct, persisting in evil deeds that disrupt the proper *qi*, and thus destroy the treasures of Heaven. Therefore, I have been sent down to produce writings for the virtuous ruler, to enlighten the multitude and cause them to constantly follow my texts in their conduct, so that they no longer distress Heaven and Earth or violate Heaven’s prohibitions.

From this point onward, practice my celestial texts, and the spirits will assist the virtuous ruler in governance. Those who violate them will be punished; if people do not punish them, the spirits will. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed. I dare not violate them.”

“Very well, our discourse is nearly complete. Reflect deeply on the essentials of this text.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

*Rising*, I ask the Heavenly Master: “The talismanic strategies of the twelve thousand states each have different meanings. Where should they be placed? And according to the customs of each state, with what should one begin? With the *qi* of fire arising in the southeast beneath the Northern Dipper. I wish to hear the secret meaning of this.”

“The fire is yang, and its talisman now governs the heart of Heaven. Harmony governs bestowal, opening governs communication, and clarity governs the management of all affairs. Fire is the heart, and the heart governs the spirit. Harmony can be the chief of transformation. When all affairs are about to arise, they begin from the heart. The heart governs correct affairs, relying on benevolence to bring clarity, and it also possesses the radiance of the spirit.

The twelve thousand states, though their strategies differ, are unified in using these texts to present memorials and petitions. The *qi* of Heaven will naturally follow and flow through them. Perfected One, you must rouse yourself to promote this. Do not oppose it, or you will perish. It is because Heaven delights in producing these texts that I have been made to speak.”

*Stopping*, if you do not believe my words, seek confirmation in your own person. If you practice them, disasters will daily diminish—this is Heaven’s delight in their practice, and thus disasters are removed. If you do not practice them and suffer many illnesses and calamities, it is because Heaven is enraged and sorrowful, and you obstruct its Dao.

Do not ask others about the misfortunes of fire; seek verification here, as clear as the sun and moon. What Heaven wishes to do, you must not be careless about. If you do not practice or comply, it will cause the hearts of people to be disturbed. Perfected One, be cautious.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Very well, let me admonish you once more, Perfected One. If Heaven does not wish it to be practiced and you alone practice it, you will suffer illness. My texts take this as their proof. From now on, it will always be so. The texts have been repeatedly emphasized; I will not add more words to make the Dao difficult to understand.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Very well, let me admonish you once more: these disasters and illnesses are not the fault of the people of this single age. Their origins are ancient and far-reaching. Do not suddenly harm them in return.”

“Only by following the Way of Heaven can these be dissolved and extinguished. This is what it means to align with the will and intent of Heaven. If you do not act according to my texts and instead rashly impose harsh punishments, disasters will multiply day by day, and Heaven will not be pleased. Perfected One, do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

**Fire Qi and the Rectification of the Spirit Way, Scroll 135**

“May I ask: in ancient times, when the Fire phase prevailed, it coincided with Great Peace, yet the Spirit Way was not rectified. Why does the Heavenly Master now uniquely command the rectification of the Fire phase’s Spirit Way?”

“Excellent is your question! Thus it is: a hundred people have a hundred intentions, a thousand people have a thousand intentions, ten thousand people have ten thousand intentions—each employs different strategies, all distinct. Hence, most fail to align with the will and intent of Heaven. What you say is correct. Now, the Fire qi is at its most flourishing, and the qi of the Supreme Sovereign arrives, yet all remain in servitude. In ancient times, the Fire phase came after the qi of Great Peace—a state unseen since the opening of Heaven and Earth.”

“Why must the Spirit Way be rectified when Fire qi is flourishing? I wish to hear your reasoning.”

“Ah, Fire is the heart of Heaven. The heart governs the spirit; when the heart is upright, the spirit is properly luminous. Thus, Heaven has sent me down to govern the Spirit Way.”

“But the Spirit Way is inherently numinous—why must it be governed?”

“Excellent is your question. The spirit is Heaven’s upright official. Now, with many wayward spirits, the true spirits cannot hold their proper places. The Spirit Way within Heaven is thrown into great disorder, and all lose their proper abodes. Today, the qi of Heaven is unbalanced, and the Emperor is distressed by this, yet people do not grasp its essential meaning. You wish to delight in knowing its [obscured text]—this is like the case of humanity. Now, many wicked people occupy positions of power and together disrupt the Emperor’s governance. If upright people cannot hold their proper places, Heaven and Earth lose their rectitude through wayward qi. When the wayward are many, they jointly harm the upright; when the upright are many, they jointly suppress the wayward. These two principles are the natural arts of Heaven and Earth. Do you understand?

Thus, the Great Yang has never been more flourishing. Yang is called spirit, and so Heaven is spirit. Yin is called wayward, and so perverse qi constantly moves through the Yin, never daring to act openly in daylight. If the perverse act openly in daylight, it is called Yin usurping the path of Yang. If illness arises in daylight, it is called the flourishing of Yin and the loss of the Way of Yang—a sign that the ruler’s power has long been in decline. Therefore, Heaven has sent me to rectify the Spirit Way, so that such things dare not occur again. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed! Excellent, excellent!”

**The One Hundred and Thirty-Sixth Formula: The Supreme Equilibrium of Qi and the Absence of Parasites**

“May I ask: when the Supreme Equilibrium of Qi prevails, nothing remains untreatable. Thus, the Heavenly Master examined the sores, scabies, and parasites that consume people. Is this the sole test of its efficacy? What of the other parasites?”

“Excellent! You now ask as a true person should. Does Heaven send illness to instruct you in this? Heaven deeply abhors human wickedness—when corrupt officials and people defy Heaven and Earth, conspiring to deceive their superiors, concealing their perverse deeds in darkness, accumulating like parasites devouring a person. Heaven loathes this. Thus, it compels you to question this repeatedly.

Now, when parasites consume a person, this is what is meant by ‘parasites governing the person.’ Such calamities are most severe, for they invert qi and disorder the upright. Yet when the Imperial Equilibrium of Qi prevails, such manifestations should not occur.

True Person, you have been entrusted with the Power of the Sovereign. Do you wish to understand the thorough harmony of the Dao? Then know this: among the people, the names of all parasites—great and small, those that cause harm—have been shifted. Sores, epidemics, wounds, and scabies, along with all parasites of the three worms within the abdomen, have had their names reassigned.

Where the shift is most extensive, the land below teems with parasites governing people. Where these parasites are absent, none below are governed by parasites. Where they are few, few parasites govern people.”

“Excellent! Yet this humble student, dull and ignorant, once believed this to be the natural order of Heaven. Why, then, does it now require remedy?”

“How foolish you are—why do you suffer such acute pain? Among all things under Heaven and Earth, humans are most noble, while parasites are most base. Yet they devour humans—this is the inversion of the upright. It mirrors the wayless vile preying upon people.

Thus, Heaven clearly perceives this inversion and commands the worthy and sagely to devise strategies to restore the upright. All calamities and anomalies manifest according to their kind, which is how the sages of antiquity came to understand them. Without such categorization, no strategy can be conceived.

Those that conceal themselves within do so in imitation of the lowly who conspire in secret, daring not to appear outwardly. The outward is Yang—Yang is Heaven, the ruler. Heaven rightly governs the Emperor. Thus, parasites that flee inward to secretly consume people mirror the worthless ministers who hide within to gnaw away at the people in secret.”

“How terrifying! This humble student is deeply alarmed.”

“That you fear Heaven is indeed right; had you not feared Heaven, you would long since have perished. Sage, take heed.”

“Indeed, indeed. Thus in antiquity, those who governed brought forth the true spirits to govern, summoned ghosts to govern, employed things to govern, and used insects to govern—what was there to fear? I wish to hear of this.”

“Now, the spirits act in accord with Heaven’s heart and share the mind of the divine. Thus the spirits are Heaven’s envoys, and Heaven cherishes them. Ghosts, in their movements, evade human dwellings; lurking in the Yin’s midst, they whisper in secret like specters—hence summoning ghosts. Things, in their movements, deceive their superiors together, cunning as creatures—hence employing things. Insects, in their movements, covet profit from people and together covet profit from their superiors, their motives as tangled as brambles—hence using insects. Heaven’s transformations respond to each in kind, all following this pattern. The Virtuous Lord of Great Peace, upon receiving the celestial writings of the empire, traced the origins of all calamities and anomalies to report them—how truly divine! ”

“Excellent! Excellent! The qi of calamity has now been thoroughly examined and harmonized.”

“How do you know this?”
“I have witnessed the Celestial Master’s rectitude and thus know that never again will insects devour people—hence the harmony.”
“You may indeed be said to grasp the intent of the Way!”
“May I ask: what do the repeated characters govern? They govern the guiding of rectitude, and guiding rectitude opens the spirit to contemplation. When one enters the chamber with them, they serve as a protective contract—how is this done? Might I hear of it?”
“Yes. It is easily understood yet profoundly subtle; these words are light in form but weighty in meaning and must not be recklessly transmitted. Those who are refined ingest them and are called ‘spiritual’; those who are unrefined ingest them and are called ‘unspiritual.’ Those who are unrefined and ingest them speak recklessly. Thus the Way is transmitted only to the proper person. In all matters, clarity comes only when the right person is found; if not, it is called reckless action, and the fault returns to afflict the one who acts. Does the Perfected One understand this?”
“Indeed, indeed. I dare not act recklessly and sincerely entrust it to the proper person.”

“Thus I speak to you of it: take cinnabar as the character, placing it first above, then proceeding downward to instruct others. One must first bathe and purify the essence, then face north, west, south, and east to declare it. Make the offering solemn with fine wine, as clear as water once drunk. Contemplate the character, and for all time let it serve as the guardian of the body. Moreover, when one faces true rectitude, the qi of goodness arrives, illness is dispelled, the complexion becomes ever more lustrous, and if one sees the character, one contemplates it according to where the ailment resides—this is called ‘returning the essence to nourish the form.’ Even those without illness who practice this grow daily more tranquil. If the body harbors strong malevolent spirits or creatures, they may resist and contend, though their fury remains unchanged. Persist in contemplation without wavering, and in time they will be subdued and depart.

“From this point onward, Heaven delights in those who act with uprightness. If one employs other texts, the celestial spirits will also aid those below, moving as human intention directs. The superior person, upon seeing others ingest the character, returns to contemplate it likewise and can teach it with every ingestion. Thus it is said: the Way of Heaven moves in a single day. My Way does not rely on mere words but establishes resonance with the Way of Heaven, harmonizing as an echo—this is what is called ‘spiritual.’ Perfected One, be cautious.

“Once the celestial spirits are opened, the Way returns to the Lord of Virtue, who entrusts it to the worthy and good. People stand upright on their own, benefiting the clarity of governance above. The enlightened master of the Lord of Virtue instructs with awe-inspiring solemnity. All that is declared becomes real, and all that is witnessed of the divine must not be spoken of. Through this, the superior person attains deliverance from the world, the middling person reaches non-action, and the lesser person achieves steadiness. What each person gains varies in depth, for the celestial spirits decree it according to the talismanic writings. Thus it is said: do not transmit it, for the contemplation must not differ. If it differs, it cannot be spoken of.

“How true! How easy! Such is the Way. How essential! How concise! Such is the aspiration for longevity. Those who study it will naturally align themselves, naturally become good, and possess divine clarity, transforming their hearts and minds to find joy. Some may ingest my character today and later teach others with different texts, instructing ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, all in accord. The Way operates in an instant, circulating throughout the eight directions and the six conjunctions, with spirit and essence following to heal illness.

“From this time forward, the people of the world will all early rectify their conduct, delighting in the true texts and no longer engaging in deceit or falsehood. If the Perfected One wishes to bring peace to the Way of Heaven and Earth and swiftly rectify illness, the threefold Way of circulating texts should come first.”

“I wish to hear of this precedence.”
“Excellent, your inquiry is apt. The foolish are difficult to correct, and their self-inflicted chaos troubles the Lord of Virtue. Thus the circulating texts are placed first, causing those above and below, great and small, to correct one another, sparing the common people from the harm of solitary words and contentious scholars.”

“Excellent! Excellent! I wish to hear why the threefold Way of circulating texts must have many documents with preceding and following texts, rather than a single transmission.”
“Excellent! Excellent! Your words align with the intent of Heaven. The reason for preceding and following texts with difficult questions is to make the common people deeply aware of their faults. The great illness of isolated speech lies in not recognizing the evil of solitary words and single texts, and thus one cannot perceive the goodness of collected circulating texts. Without transmitting their errors and distinguishing their great faults, the heart cannot be liberated—only then can it be saved. If the heart is not liberated, one does not understand one’s actions, and the error grows over time. When the human heart awakens, rectification becomes easy.

“All my writings follow this principle, not only this one. Do you understand?”
“Indeed, indeed.”
“Go, you have understood. Perfected One, be cautious in your affairs. The written texts are sufficient; do not lightly ask repeated questions. I was reluctant to explain further, fearing it would trouble you, yet I wished to expound further for your sake. Now, the great texts of the Way, like the Way of Heaven, cannot be exhausted in phrases. If one grasps their intent, Heaven rejoices greatly; if not, one opposes the Way of Heaven, incurring fault and offending Heaven. I dare not speak further. Go.”

Right Great Compendium: Difficult Questions on the Destruction of Heaven and Earth, the Rise of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Eclipses, Violent Deaths, the Strategies of the Twelve Thousand States, Talismanic Scripts, and Divine Formulas
*Collated and Combined Text of the Scripture of Great Peace, Scroll Ninety-Three, Ji Section, Part Eight*
*Scripture of Great Peace, Scroll Ninety-Three*
*Divine Formula for Reciprocal Treatment through Suppression and Consolidation, One Hundred Thirty-Seventh*

“Now, this foolish student has obtained the written texts of the Heavenly Master, collated various scriptures and medical formulas, and retired to a quiet place to distinguish and ponder their essential meaning. Yet there remains a doubt I cannot resolve, and I humbly request to ask one matter.

Today, the Heavenly Master has collated various formulas, stating:
- Those with a ten-out-of-ten cure rate are formulas by which the celestial spirits effect the treatment;
- Those with a nine-out-of-ten cure rate are formulas by which the terrestrial spirits effect the treatment;
- Those with an eight-out-of-ten cure rate are formulas by which human spirit and essence effect the treatment.
Those below this are not to be used.

This foolish student believes that only by obtaining the awe-inspiring power of suppression and consolidation can reciprocal treatment be achieved; without obtaining this power, reciprocal treatment cannot be achieved.”

“Excellent! The Perfected One has spoken, grasping the difficult intent.”

Yet, beyond the boundless caverns of the unseen, all that the eye beholds and the ear perceives—every creeping, crawling thing—is born of Heaven. Were Heaven not to generate it, it would not exist. Thus, each possesses its own presiding spirit, to which its fate is bound. Consider the six domestic beasts: their fate is tied to humankind, their life and death resting solely in human hands. Humankind, then, is the spirit that governs their destiny. All twelve thousand things in the world receive their mandate from Heaven and Earth and move accordingly. Were even one thing lacking, the celestial mandate would be incomplete, and so they are made to govern and subdue one another. Moreover, each is assigned its own hierarchy of rank and lordship, enabling the Dao of Heaven to regulate all things through mutual governance. Those formulas with a ten-out-of-ten cure rate—achieved by invoking what they fear—are precisely those whose fate is bound to Heaven. Does the Perfected One understand this?

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go then, for you have grasped it.”

“I beg to ask one more doubt, though it may seem impertinent—dare I speak?”

“Proceed without hesitation.”

“If a bandit robs another, they are both subject to humankind—how can this be called a mandate from Heaven or a lordship ordained by fate?”

“Excellent! A keen challenge indeed. The bandit who robs another acts without righteousness, wrongfully subduing their fellow for a fleeting moment, never to hold dominion long. The moment they overpower another, grave transgression follows, and the authorities pursue them relentlessly. How can you claim this is Heaven’s mandate? When a true ruler governs the people, are they ever hunted down? All people are born to recognize the ruler as their lord and the arbiter of their fate. Does the Perfected One now comprehend?”

“I understand fully.”

“Well said, well said! Let the diligent scholar refine this understanding and not raise reckless questions, for Heaven is not as mortals are.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“If there has been any offense, take heed—be mindful and do not speak as carelessly as the common folk.”

“Indeed, indeed. This foolish student often errs gravely in speech. Yet if I remain silent, I will never come to know the truth. Now, I wish to ask another question but hesitate to speak abruptly.”

“Proceed.”

“If all things each have their own lord, do Heaven and Earth also have a lord?”

“Ah! What a profoundly subtle and far-reaching question you pose!”

“Now I realize my questions were immodest and fell short of the Master’s depth of inquiry—thus I failed to grasp the truth.”

“Indeed. Heaven takes the Central Ultimate, the highest of all, as its lord; Earth takes Kunlun’s Waste as its lord; the sun takes the King Sun as its lord; the moon takes the Great Moon as its lord; the stars take the Central Ultimate Star as their lord; the many mountains take the Five Peaks as their lords; the Five Peaks take Mount Tai, beneath the Central Ultimate, as their lord; the hundred rivers take the Yangzi and the seas as their lords; creatures with shells take the divine tortoise as their lord; those with scales take the dragon as their lord; winged fliers take the phoenix as their lord; furred beasts take the qilin as their lord; naked creatures take humans as their lord; and humans take the emperor as their lord. Such hierarchies in the world are too numerous to recount—yet I have merely outlined their guiding principles and shown their origins for the Perfected One. Do you now understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“You ought to ponder deeply on this meaning, though it cannot all be committed to memory—it would be difficult to exhaust its practical applications.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now, I speak of creatures that crawl and possess awareness: those that dwell within one’s own body accomplish their tasks without need for prompting. Why should one recklessly kill or harm them? The lord fears that such acts may provoke the wrath of their superiors. In this era of Great Peace, when the qi of harmony prevails, one should join with a virtuous ruler to govern with concerted effort, refraining from wanton injury. To do otherwise would disrupt the qi of Great Peace and throw governance into chaos.”

“How could such small creatures possibly move Heaven to disorder, causing governance to fall into chaos?”

“Alas! You remain as one benighted, still far from true understanding. Each of these has its own lord and superior—just as the lowliest and most despised people in the distant frontiers are to the emperor, so too are the most wretched of men to the tiniest ants. There is no comparing their numbers. If, without cause, a person were to harm or kill even a hundred or so of them, their families would cry out in grievance, petitioning the emperor. Upon hearing this, the emperor would fly into a rage, issuing decrees to investigate and punish the offenders. The commotion would spread through provinces, commanderies, and counties, treated as a matter of grave consequence, and many would be brought to ruin as a result. Do you understand now?”

“How terrifying! How terrifying!”

“Excellent. You now grasp the great terror—thus shall you attain long life.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Therefore, the sage-kings of antiquity, knowing the celestial patterns and luminous models, dared not recklessly employ punishment. Theirs was the utmost depth of thoughtful foresight. Thus their governance remained ever balanced, requiring no exertion of force, yet winning the heart of Heaven—all through their reverent caution. Now, the minor lapses of former kings have borne consequences through generations, each with its gains and losses, making governance difficult to balance. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now, as the qi of Great Peace arrives, Heaven cherishes the virtuous ruler. Thus I set forth these warnings in full, making transgression difficult. Take my writings and present them to the ruler of supreme virtue, that he may reflect upon his ill intentions.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

*Right: Collected Difficulties on the Mandates of Medicinal Substances and Their Belongings*
*Each Has Its Own Lord and Superior*
*Yang’s Honor and Yin’s Humility: Secret Formula One Hundred Thirty-Eight*

“May I ask why Yang alone attains honor and nobility, while Yin is solely named lowly and base?”

“Excellent indeed is your question! You nearly perceive the intent of the Dao and virtue. Yang is called honorable and noble because it guards its root, ever full and replete with substance. Yin is called lowly and base because it is hollow and empty, devoid of substance—hence it is despised and scorned.”

“This foolish student, receiving Heaven’s mandate yet feeble and ignorant, remains shrouded in darkness, slow to comprehend. I beg the Heavenly Master to fully explain its meaning.”

“Why have you not yet fully perceived the intent of the Way of Heaven? Even perfected beings struggle to grasp it—how much more so the benighted common folk!

Now, the names Yin and Yang, male and female, arise from the primal qi at its very inception—the gateway of Yin and Yang. Where humans receive their mandate and life is their root. Thus, the male receives his mandate full and overflowing, with surplus. Below and to his left and right, each still holds a kernel of substance. Above, he is full and overflowing, ever bestowing upon the Yin below. His surplus accumulates, ever substantial. The bestowing above corresponds to the movement of the Great Yang of Heaven—nothing it cannot generate, nothing it cannot complete. The accumulation below corresponds to the Great Yin, to Earth, with its patterns and veins like field boundaries. The left substance corresponds to humanity; the right substance, to the myriad things. *Substance* means kernel, the essence—thus benevolence delights in bestowing, and it possesses kernel and essence. Therefore, Yang is called honorable and noble. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Yin becomes woman, and thus she is deemed lowly and base. The place where she receives her mandate is hollow and empty, without fullness or surplus, and moreover without kernel or substance—hence she is seen as lowly and base.

Originally, the names Yin and Yang, male and female, referred to these two matters. Yet in the body’s upper and lower parts, there is nothing that can be named as such. The original names Yin and Yang are distinguished by these two matters.

Consider the woman: her head, eyes, face, ears, and limbs are all the same as the man’s. In her love of goodness, she may even surpass men—yet she is deemed lowly and base for this very reason. The man’s head, face, and limbs are no different, and in his love of goodness he falls short of the woman—yet he is called honorable and noble precisely for this reason.”

“Excellent, excellent!”

“Indeed, you may be said to have awakened to this truth. Thus the Dao of Heaven values the root and guards the origin, and so the sage observes the patterns of Heaven and their radiant clarity. Therefore, one must return to the root, guard the primordial, rectify characters, and examine texts to resolve confusion. Only thus can Heaven and Earth be made enduringly secure and the state joyful.

Thus, to guard the root and possess substance, to delight in bestowing—this is the good person. To be rootless, hollow, and without kernel or substance, ever deficient yet ever covetous—this is the evil person, the base person. This is what is meant.”

“Now I wish to ask one final question.”

“Proceed.”

“When a woman conceives as the Celestial Master foretold, why is there no substance?”

“Alas! You are inwardly hollow, much like one without the Dao. Yet Heaven sees your earnest and single-minded devotion, and so permits you to come and inquire. Now, in the conception of your wife: the yin root is empty, but the yang comes to bestow and transform, filling the yin. Yin, being humble and base, reveres yang, submits to it, and nourishes it, not daring to cast it away.

Yang is Heaven, the ruler; yin is Earth, the minister. Thus, it honors and reveres the bestowal of yang and thereby nourishes it, not daring to cast it away. If you wish to know its truth, consider this: when a lord has a guest who lodges in a humble household, the household nourishes him and does not dare send him away. The guest, in turn, grows robust and attains full stature—this is precisely the same principle.

The common saying goes, ‘Yang gives birth, yin brings to completion,’ but in truth, yin merely follows and nourishes, bringing the yang’s substance to fulfillment. My writings often explain it in this way. I see that you, a true person, delight in knowing the kernel of the true Dao and the utmost essential intent of Heaven, and so I have spoken to you in concise terms. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go then, for you have awakened.”

“Now I wish to ask: only humans have male and female—can this distinction of yin and yang’s substance be made? Does it apply to all things under Heaven and Earth?”

“Alas!”

“You remain as if deluded and uncomprehending. Excellent! The true person’s questions are indeed difficult. Yet the nature of Heaven and Earth applies to all things without exception. Let me tell you something that penetrates from the highest above to the deepest below. You, as you speak, must now open both ears and listen—do not miss a single fraction.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Very well. When yang resides in the outer realm, all things conceive and gestate among the upper branches and leaves. At that time, Heaven’s yang qi lingers outside and has not yet returned to the roots below, so all comes to fruition at the surface. Creeping creatures, the multitude of beings, and the people all accumulate and gather outwardly. But when the yang qi returns inward to the earth below, every kind of thing above becomes empty and devoid of substance, while all conceive and bear fruit below. The earth nourishes the roots and leaves, and creeping creatures and the people likewise enter and accumulate inwardly—this is the great luminous proof by which August Heaven demonstrates the true kernel of yang’s substance. Thus, those who hold to the Dao of yang possess the true kernel, while those who cling to the Dao of yin lack it. Therefore, the sages of antiquity governed by emulating Heaven and dared not emulate Earth.”

“I wish to hear: what does it mean to emulate Heaven?”

“To emulate Heaven is to gather the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened, the Confucian scholars, the Daoist masters, and the sagely wise—this is called emulating Heaven. To amass wealth and goods, petty men, the unworthy, and those ignorant of culture and refinement is called emulating Earth.”

“Excellent, excellent! I wish to hear: how do the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened, the Confucian scholars, the Daoist masters, and the sagely wise emulate Heaven?”

“Heaven is the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened, the Confucian scholars, the Daoist masters, and the sagely wise. Moreover, Heaven can ride the qi and soar—these six kinds of people, those of superior talent who remain unwavering in their devotion to the true Dao, may also attain the ability to ride the qi and soar. Thus they belong to Heaven and emulate Heaven. For this reason, the sages of antiquity alone deeply understood the intent of August Heaven and dared not lose it.”

“I wish to hear: how does gathering wealth and goods, along with petty and unworthy men, emulate Earth?”

“Indeed. Wealth gathers below and forms mud; mud transforms into dung; dung transforms into earth. The petty, the foolish, and the unworthy gather in deafness and blindness, ignorant of the Dao and its arts, entering inauspicious gates. They are destined to dwell early beneath the earth. If they are not buried, in time they become a profound harm to Heaven and Earth. To govern with them is to disrupt the patterns of Heaven and Earth, the Five Phases locked in daily strife! The four seasons lose their order, the Three Luminaries dim, Heaven and Earth detest them, and the hundred spirits do not love them. They bring no benefit to the proper ordering of things and should meet their end as swiftly as that wealth. Do you, true person, understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“How terrifying! How terrifying indeed!”

“If you recognize what is terrifying, you may long endure; if you do not soon awaken to terror, you will compound Heaven and Earth’s gravest fault.”

“This foolish one stands in great awe.”

“If you revere this law of Heaven, Heaven will preserve you; if you do not hold it in awe, you will share the same principle as all that lives. For good and ill do not originate with Heaven—they are transgressions, sought and obtained by people themselves. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go forth, and be ever vigilant.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

*Right: A Collection of Difficulties Concerning the Root Causes of Male and Female, Noble and Base, Yin and Yang—The Essential Distinction Between the Superior Person and the Petty Person. Formula One Hundred Thirty-Nine, of Which There Are Too Many to Count.*

**Opening:**
“May I ask one matter?”

“Speak plainly.”

“I wish to know how many states exist in the world.”

“Profound! Wondrous! The question you ask. Now, within the central region lie eighty-one domains. Beyond them, encircling once more, the world holds ten thousand states, extending even to the boundless reaches of the Cavernous Void, where the three divisions together comprise twelve thousand states.”

**Closing:**
“Why then are there twelve thousand states?”

“The celestial reckoning begins with one and ends with ten. Ten multiplied yields the Way of Heaven, which reaches five and then returns. Thus it arrives at ten thousand states. The remaining two thousand correspond to the alternating reckoning of yin and yang, as when numbers end at ten. The reckoning of years and months stands alone at twelve, with an intercalary month added every five years. This reflects the cyclical arising of Heaven and Earth, the inner and outer of the Cavernous Void of Heaven. It accords with the combined reckoning of Heaven and Earth, so that twelve months return and merge into one year, with the intercalary month following within. These twelve months are the reckoning of the primordial qi’s hidden depths, the alternating inception of yin and yang. It is as when the myriad things perish in *hai*, and the celestial stems begin their cycle, establishing position at the Gate of Heaven. The first coagulation occurs in *hai*, gestation in *ren*, and formation takes shape. The first nine returns on the day of *zi*; the second nine in *chou*, where yin and yang revolve; the third nine in *yin*, when Heaven, Earth, and humanity—all things—turn from yin toward yang, gazing toward *yin*. Thus the myriad things first spread their roots in the northeast and show their heads in *yin*. The greatest of things take wood as their elder, so *yin* marks the beginning of wood’s birth. *Jia* is wood’s primal stem, so all things appear in *jia-yin* and perish in *gui-hai*. Thus wood receives its mandate and life from the primordial qi within the Great Yin’s water, and so *jia-zi* is taken as the beginning. The celestial reckoning of change revolves through fivefold multiplication, so five thousand added to the twelve earthly branches makes sixty, with *gui-hai* as the reckoning’s end. Do you, true person, understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“I have not yet grasped its meaning.”

“Now you wander in darkness—ponder it long and deeply, and the meaning will come to you. Go, ponder it.

Why does the true person constantly ask how many states there are under Heaven?”

“This foolish student has received the Celestial Master’s writings, which can repay Heaven and Earth’s profound merit, heal Heaven and Earth’s illnesses, and relieve the virtuous emperor of the accumulated disasters and calamities since the founding of Heaven and Earth. Now, with the Celestial Master’s scripture of the One Dao, I entrust it to a single virtuous state. Yet even if that state’s ruler possesses the virtue of ten thousand men, how can he alone resolve the boundless disasters of yin and yang in Heaven and Earth? How can he circulate throughout and govern the inner and outer realms of Heaven and Earth, cutting off the illnesses of the infinite, hollow, and distant?”

“Ah! Well said. Did Heaven prompt you to ask this? Alas! How astonishing! Alas! How astonishing! I wished to remain silent, but now I fear that failing to remove this great misfortune would be my fault. True person, how did you come to ask this?”

“This foolish student, having received the Celestial Master’s teachings, returned to my dwelling to reflect upon their meaning. Where I found uncertainty, I asked.”

“Now you understand only that a single state has a virtuous ruler—why do you ask this?”

“If the Celestial Master’s scripture merely resolves the disasters of one virtuous state, it would only heal a single realm. How then could it heal the illnesses of Heaven and Earth and repay the August Heaven’s profound merit?”

“Excellent! Your words are well spoken.”

“There is nothing I can add to your words. True person, pray expound your meaning.”

“Very well. Now, the Celestial Master speaks of Heaven and Earth as vast and hollow, containing twelve thousand states. If only one virtuous state receives the Dao, how can it resolve the disasters of all twelve thousand states and bring universal peace to Heaven and Earth?”

“Excellent! Your words are most apt. Did the Lord of Destiny indeed prompt you to ask this?”

“Indeed.”

“Now, for the true person, I shall explain in full, that the matter may be made clear and all illnesses and disasters under Heaven may be wholly eradicated. I stand in awe of Heaven’s majesty and dare not conceal anything. Apply your strength to record my words.”

“Understood.”

“Attend: the celestial reckoning begins with one and ends with ten. One multiplied by ten is ten. Each ten multiplied by ten reaches one hundred; one hundred multiplied by ten reaches one thousand; one thousand multiplied by ten reaches ten thousand. One is the beginning of numbers; ten is their end. One hundred represents the virtuous states and regions. You need only take my scripture and go forth to teach one state of great virtue. Those who transmit my scripture shall carry the original and never exhaust it, circulating it to bestow upon one hundred virtuous regions. When one state receives my scripture, its good people will all turn toward it, and its virtue will spread to the four directions. One hundred states will all be transformed by its influence and become good. Thus, Heaven and Earth will both be at peace, disasters will be removed, and by bestowing it upon one hundred virtuous states, the ten thousand states will suffer no harm, and all illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be eradicated.”

“Excellent! Excellent! I wish to hear why you do not teach this to me so that I may instruct others.”

“Ah, the reason it cannot be taught in such a manner is that states without virtue are those Heaven has doomed to decline and cannot practice the true Dao. Thus, they must turn toward the virtuous states. Now, if the virtueless states all turn toward those with virtue and power, they too will naturally be governed.”

“Excellent! Excellent! I wish to hear why you take precisely these one hundred virtuous states as the model.”

“Excellent! Your question strikes at the heart of the matter.”

“Now, the numbers of Heaven, Earth, and humanity follow this principle: Heaven’s number begins with one and ends with ten. When Heaven distributes its bounty upon Earth, life emerges, and only after the numbers are complete do they manifest—fittingly forming one hundred. When Heaven, Earth, and humanity are all present, and these three unite in a single heart, then virtue is achieved. If even one matter is not in harmony, then virtue and power cannot be realized.”

“I wish to hear why Heaven’s number begins precisely with one.”

“One represents the time when primordial *qi* is utterly pure. Primordial *qi* coalesces without pattern, just as wind has no fixed form—thus it is collectively named ‘one.’ When one congeals, it forms Heaven. Heaven possesses above and below, the eight directions, hence it is ten. Additionally, there are the five directions, each with its own yin and yang, thus the number is ten. Below, it corresponds to Earth. That which descends to correspond with Earth—its numbers, too, are complete at ten before life arises. Thus, humans mirror Heaven’s number, being born only after ten months. One is precisely the time when its bestowal is harmonious and all-pervading. Those who have already received this bestowal must in turn mirror Heaven’s number, emerging only after ten months—hence the number concludes at ten. Therefore, one multiplies ten. The Way of Earth is the mother; it aligns with the center, thus uniting with harmony and connecting to humanity. Only when Heaven, Earth, and humanity mutually attain one another is virtue and power achieved—hence the one hundred virtuous states. Thus, Heaven governs birth, Earth governs nurturance, and humanity governs completion. If even one matter strays from correctness, all three fall into error. Therefore, if Heaven acts wickedly, it brings misfortune; if Earth acts wickedly, it brings misfortune; if humanity acts wickedly, it brings misfortune. When all three act wickedly together, Heaven, Earth, and humanity are extinguished and their numbers begin anew. When all three act with goodness, virtue pervades emptiness and unites as one. Thus, only when the three unite is virtue achieved—fittingly, the one hundred states.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“This is the guiding principle of the ten thousand states, the realm where Heaven, Earth, and humanity unite in virtue. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Thus, the Perfected One has now eradicated illness from Heaven and Earth and removed the burden of inherited transgressions for the Lord of Virtue. Though you endure hardship in upholding my scriptures and transmitting them to the hundred virtuous states, all afflictions of yin and yang shall vanish, and the calamities of emperors and kings shall all be dispelled.”

“Excellent! Excellent! Had this foolish student not pressed his inquiries with diligence, there would have been no means to attain this knowledge.”

“Your words are apt. To study without diligent inquiry is no different from not studying at all. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity questioned their teachers day and night without daring to slacken, and so they came to comprehend the Dao of Heaven.”

“Indeed, indeed. With earnest inquiry, I dare not grow remiss.”

“In this way, you have already grasped the Dao.”

“I wish to ask: today, the customs of the world vary—if one were to teach and admonish them with a single Dao, would there be no doubt?”

“Alas! In speaking thus, you reveal yourself to be even more foolish, benighted, and ignorant. Why is this? The rites and propriety of these customs are but false conduct, not their true nature. All under Heaven receive the nature of Heaven and Earth, with the Five Phases as their storehouse and the four seasons as their qi. They harmonize yin and yang to propagate their kind, all delighting in life and abhorring death, all partaking of food and drink to nourish their bodies, all loving goodness and detesting evil—there is no difference among them. As for those who do not comprehend the Perfected One’s scriptures and fail to grasp them, when instructing them, the Perfected One should employ their local language and customary teachings, adapting to their ways so that they may commit the words to memory through their own effort. In this manner, all under Heaven will know how to apply them without doubt. My Dao is like the sun and moon, circulating and illuminating all beneath Heaven, each perceiving its brilliance clearly, vast and luminous in full measure. If you wish to further verify its truth, consider the myriad creatures—even the crawling insects—all share one Heaven and Earth, the Six Jia, the Five Phases, and the four seasons, and this is more than sufficient. Thus, all are taught according to the standards of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go forth. If difficulties do not cease, the explanations will be endless. Now, the great scriptures of the Dao are, on the contrary, difficult to fathom.”

“Indeed, indeed. I wish to ask one more matter and then desist.”

“Speak.”

“What of the twelve thousand states?”

“These are included within the reckoning, like intercalary months. If you wish to know the details, consider this: in counting, ten marks the end, yet a year concludes only after twelve months, with an intercalary month sometimes added, making thirteen. This is what is meant. But when the hundred states practice virtue, the ten thousand states will be free of calamity, and the illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be entirely dispelled—this, too, is removed as one.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“If you exert yourself and circulate my scriptures among the hundred virtuous states, adapting the teachings to each custom, then the twelve thousand states will all be at peace, the illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be greatly dispelled, and your years will increase without limit. If you find peace in your youth, you will attain youthful longevity; if you find peace in middle age, you will attain middle-aged longevity; if you find complete peace, you will attain boundless years. Since the Perfected One harbors good intentions, Heaven has ordained that you ask these questions in full—you should thus attain full peace, without subjecting yourself to great toil. For Heaven, though supremely divine and luminous, without peer, still constantly practices the Dao with arduous effort, completing one circuit each day. All things find peace in this, and thus alone attain perpetual fortune and long life. Earth, too, follows Heaven’s actions and nurtures accordingly. If Heaven were to cease its daily movement, the sun, moon, and stars would not shift, and there would be an imbalance of qi—Heaven would then perish. Since Heaven practices the Dao without ceasing, it attains long life—how much more so should you? Strive, each bending effort for your own sake, not for others. My unceasing explanations are also for my own sake, not for yours. All beings, from the Six Extremes to the myriad creatures, each calculate for their own benefit and cannot do so for others. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Having received the Heavenly Master’s words and deeds, I have had them recorded in the state of the virtuous, never daring to slacken.”

“Excellent. You have already grasped this. All of you, strive, strive—once your tasks are complete, we shall meet again.”

“Indeed, indeed. Before departing, I wish to ask one matter.”

“What is it?”

“Now the six of us will return to our quiet dwelling to ponder the Heavenly Master’s words. At times, we seem on the verge of profound understanding, yet at others, we fall into confusion and negligence. We wish to seek the Heavenly Master’s resolution of these doubts. Though I hesitate to trouble you further, fearing separation until the end of our natural years without another chance to learn, I overcome my shame and venture to request one more word.”

“Proceed. Heaven has ordained that I meet and speak with you six—do not decline.”

“Indeed, indeed. Now I wish to ask: of all the states under Heaven, are there only twelve thousand? Or are there more?”

“Ah! How profound your question! Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, none have asked thus. Yet these twelve thousand states are but one great division; what limit could there be to the rest?”

“Why are they so numerous?”

“Ah! You now ask what lies at the very bounds of knowledge, yet you remain shrouded in darkness—truly, you do not yet comprehend. Still, observing your questions, I see you have not fully fathomed the Dao of Heaven. You seem on the verge of grasping it, yet inwardly, you fall short. The common folk dwell in ignorance and confusion—this is their nature. Compared to a Perfected One, I do not fault you. Yet I shall open your ears further and explain for the six of you.

Heaven extends upward and downward without limit, and outward without bound. Wherever it converges, it forms a division of boundaries—how could there be an end to its divisions? Now, tell me: where does the uppermost Heaven reach its limit? What lies beyond it, and where does it find its ultimate boundary? Where does the lowermost Earth reach its limit? What lies beneath it, and where does it find its final boundary? Where does Heaven and Earth extend outward to their limit, and why do they turn back upon reaching the middle? These six directions—where do they find their end? Thus, the Dao of Heaven is without limit or cessation. In great use, it suffices; in small use, it suffices. In great use, it abounds; in small use, it abounds. Do you Perfected Ones understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

Alas! How astonishing! Alas! Had you not pressed your inquiry with such vigor, there would have been no way to attain this knowledge.”

“Indeed, you may be said to have glimpsed a small awakening. Go now, and ask no further. I fear the Six Perfected Ones would be startled and undone—for this lies beyond the reach of human effort, and to force the question is to invite great harm. Yet the burden of a teacher is heavy, and seeing your distress, I shall clarify further for you. Go, and listen with open ears. Sit calmly and attend.”

“Very well.”

“If you wish to delight in understanding its vast effects, consider this: a single household has a father, a mother, and a child—this, too, is a complete family under the Dao of Heaven. The father resembles Heaven, the mother resembles Earth, and the child resembles the harmony between them. Their gathered possessions, all that the household contains, resemble the myriad things—thus forming a single family. The father is as the ruler, the mother as the minister, the child as the people, and their wealth circulates to nourish one another, just as the myriad things do. This one family shares a single great concern. A single district of ten thousand households likewise forms one family, sharing one great concern. Ten districts unite to form a commandery, also one family, sharing one great concern. Ten commanderies unite to form a great province, also one family, sharing one great concern. Ten provinces unite to form a great state, also one great family, sharing one great concern, and thus forming one great boundary.

When the emperor possesses virtue, his concern extends to the twelve provinces; when his great concern reaches the thirteen provinces, they too become one great family, sharing one great concern. Beyond this boundary, in distant lands not subject to human rule, if a realm possesses the Dao and virtue, its good people come; if it lacks the Dao and virtue, they do not come; if its virtue is inferior, they come to harm others. This is one division, one boundary—the demarcation of Heaven and Earth—so that the restless multitudes of the world each have their place and do not prey upon one another.

Thus, what is called the Great Ultimate, the Central Ultimate, and the Small Ultimate? The Great Ultimate governs what has no further outer boundary; the Central Ultimate governs the central division; the Small Ultimate governs each division’s boundary, where it must halt. They may only seek one another through the Dao and virtue, not through mutual predation. Heaven resents this—hence, this is called ‘sharing one family,’ and thus each shares one great concern.

If you wish to know its true essence, consider a household of father, son, husband, and wife: they worry only that their own family may not prosper, and do not concern themselves with other households. A single district shares concern for its ruler—if he is good, they promote him to higher office, each striving to advance their local officials; if he is evil, they wish to remove him together. A district, a commandery, a province, a state—all follow this principle, sharing one great concern.

Now, I record the twelve thousand states as one great division, to share one great concern with the Perfected Ones, one boundary. The remaining states beyond these twelve thousand are beyond counting. Thus, the sages of antiquity all recorded only small divisions—why did they not record the great boundaries? Heaven did not permit it. The great transformation had not yet emerged, and what they produced differed, so they could not follow the same method. Thus, they did not record it.

Now, the great transformation has emerged, and the twelve thousand states have completed their cyclical revolutions. Therefore, Heaven has sent the Perfected Ones to inquire into the scripture of the boundless and the governance of ultimate penetration. Thus, I entrust this text to the hundred states possessing virtue, where one virtuous state transforms ninety-nine others. The twelve thousand states are counted together, like the twelve months of a year forming one division, with the thirteenth month as an intercalary month—this is what is meant. Do you understand?”

“Very well.”

“Go now.”
“Very well.”

“Guard it with reverence for the divine spirits of the Heavenly Dao. Do not recklessly corrupt or destroy it.”
“Very well. Now that I have received the solemn decree of the Heavenly Illuminated Master, my heart trembles with awe. Though I have only grasped a fraction of the great scripture, I wish to hear of even a single small realm—to be shown and told of this boundless land.”
“Very well. Since the Perfected One is anxious, I shall speak briefly. Take careful note. Now, I intend for the Perfected One to amass wealth and resources, supporting the sun and moon above and the earth below. Spanning ten thousand *li* in breadth and length, I fear that resources will still be perpetually scarce and troubled. I cannot recount the names and numbers of all its lands. Do you understand?”
“Very well. This foolish one dares not press further on the Heavenly Dao. Hearing the Celestial Master’s words, I feel as though my *qi* has scattered, my soul as if lost. I dare not ask again.”
“Indeed, you may be called a student who understands matters. If you wish to repay the profound merit of Heaven and Earth and attain boundless life, simply traverse the twelve thousand lands of this great scripture, and your longevity will already be without limit. As for the six directions above and below reaching their utmost extremes, Heaven does not task the Six Masters alone with their concerns. Those who worry over them belong to another realm, and you will not be held accountable or blamed for transgressions. Their safety or peril, good or ill, have their own masters. This discourse on the scripture is concluded. Do not ask further.”
“Very well.”

“Go now. The Six Masters, exert yourselves—pray continue. The Perfected One’s learning has attained minor penetration, yet the great vision of the Heavenly Dao’s intent remains unseen. Apply greater focus and do not slacken.”

“Very well.”

“Learning without precision is no different from madness; precision without attainment is like being mute and deaf, pointing west only to ask about the east. Thus, when all the masters under Heaven engage in debate and disputation—though they may ●●●●—it is of no benefit, for they remain ignorant. It is like an infant still swaddled, not yet emerged from the womb, following its mother’s body in movement, how could it know the vastness and boundlessness of the Heavenly Dao? Therefore, lesser masters, in their anger and wild enthusiasm, expound recklessly, thereby wounding the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Losing the Dao’s intent, they cannot bring peace to their lord and king; the realm’s ●●●● all suffer their errors, their words diverging wildly. This allows calamities to spread unchecked, beyond restraint or prevention. Though books may number in the billions, the world’s disasters and harms remain unceasing, ever recurring in the same patterns—all arising from forced exposition, from the error of not knowing the essentials of the Dao. Does the Perfected One understand this?”

“Very well.”

“If I were to fully expound this for you, it would be endless and exhausting in both effort and resources, and moreover, overly burdensome—thus I shall pause here for now. If doubts remain, return to ask again.”
“Very well.”

*Right: Collected Difficult Questions and Transmitted Scriptural Secrets of the Various States and Regions*
*Reverently Serving the Spirits: Fifteenth Year of Great Peace, Secret One Hundred Forty*

“May I ask one matter?”
“Speak plainly.”
“Now that the era approaches Great Peace, can this be foreknown?”
“Yes, it can be known. By observing the five Celestial Emperors’ *qi* of Great Peace, one may know whether the coming year will be harmonious and balanced.”
“What does this mean? I wish to hear it.”
“Thus: in spring, when the Green Emperor’s *qi* is at peace; in summer, when the Red Emperor’s *qi* is at peace; in the sixth month, when the Yellow Emperor’s *qi* is at peace; in autumn, when the White Emperor’s *qi* is at peace; and in winter, when the Black Emperor’s *qi* is at peace.”
“By what means is this made clear?”
“Thus: Great Peace means that not a single thing is harmed—this is the meaning of the *qi* of Great Peace. If all matters proceed without a single injury or affliction, each attaining its proper place, then it is called ‘balanced.’ If one thing is harmed, it is immediately unbalanced; if two things are harmed, it is immediately subject to punishment; if three things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to all things; if four things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to the four directions; if five things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to the five directions, and the world suffers great calamity; if six things are harmed, it is immediately an evil that pervades the six directions; if seven things are harmed, its baleful *qi* spreads unchecked; if eight things are harmed, the worthy and the unworthy diverge in purpose and do not unite in effort; if nine things are harmed, evil thoroughly disrupts the balance of *yin* and *yang*, causing all things to churn in chaos; if ten things are harmed, the great principles are injured, and the celestial reckoning is exhausted, giving way to a new cycle. Therefore, the ancient supreme sages merely observed whether the five Celestial Emperors’ *qi* was balanced or not, and thereby knew whether governance was successful and whether peace had been achieved.”
“I wish to hear the essential meaning of this balanced secret.”
“Thus: when all things in spring are born without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Green Emperor. When all things in summer grow without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Red Emperor. When all things in the sixth month are nurtured without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Yellow Emperor. When all things in autumn mature and are harvested without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the White Emperor. When all things in winter are stored without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Black Emperor. When the five Emperors arise in Great Peace for one year, the people rejoice and act with goodness; for two years, the earth is filled with joy; for three years, their beneficence reaches to Heaven; for four years, the winds and *qi* flow in harmony; for five years, the nine spirits do not contend, and malevolent forces are subdued; for six years, the six principles are fully established; for seven years, the Three Luminaries shine with greater brilliance; for eight years, their grace extends to the eight directions; for nine years, *yin* and *yang* are both content; for ten years, the myriad things each attain their proper place. This completes the lesser cycle, and when the three are conjoined, Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are complete—thus, thirty years bring Great Peace. Now, the *qi* of the Supreme Sovereign has emerged, and the true Dao has arrived to govern, so Great Peace comes in fifteen years. If one does not diligently practice the true Dao, how can Great Peace be attained in vain? This fifteen-year path to Great Peace refers to the emperor, his ministers great and small, all following the true Dao, jointly dispelling falsehood and deceit—thus, in fifteen years, peace is achieved. Do you understand, Perfected One? Therefore, to know whether peace is approaching or not, simply observe whether the five Celestial Emperors’ *qi* is balanced or not—this is sufficient for clarity, sufficient for understanding. Thus, all omens first appear among the celestial spirits. If the celestial spirits are not at peace, how can humans alone claim to be at peace? Therefore, as the five Emperors take turns governing, each can bring about Great Peace. Those who lose the celestial spirits’ favor cannot bring peace to their rule. Thus, one must carefully follow the four seasons, attend to the five phases, and ensure the nine spirits do not contend. Therefore, one must revere their conduct and serve their spirits. Now, the foremost *qi* of Great Peace is approaching, so I instruct the Perfected One to revere the four seasons and five phases, and to have all people, great and small, together engage in the service of the spirits. In ancient times, merely revering the four seasons and five phases brought Great Peace, though it took thirty years to achieve. Now, by also revering their spirits, peace is swiftly attained in fifteen years. Do you understand, Perfected One?”
“Very well.”

“How astonishing! How astonishing!”

“Yet you have already perceived it.”

“I wish to ask: if a person’s conduct is loyal and upright with true substance, can this be known?”

“Excellent! The question you ask. When one associates with them, if their words and deeds grow daily more harsh and resentful, yet others long remember them, and by the next month they have become good; if in a month they are harsh and resentful, yet by the next year they have become good; if in youth their actions seem most wicked, yet in old age they become most good—if all turn to their words, delight in their conduct, and cherish their Dao, then this is a person of utmost loyalty, trustworthiness, and goodness, one of true and solid substance.”

“Excellent! Excellent! I further wish to ask: can one also recognize those who are disloyal, untrustworthy, and given to flattery?”

“Yes, this too can be known. When one associates with them, observe their words and deeds: day by day, month by month, they align with others’ hearts. If they appear compliant and good, yet when long remembered and put into practice, by the next month they make others grow more wicked; if in a month they seem good, yet by the next year they turn wicked; if in youth they seem good, their words appearing loyal and trustworthy, yet in old age, when their actions are long remembered and put into practice, they reveal themselves as most wicked—this is entirely the conduct of a false, flattering, disloyal, and untrustworthy person. In old age, when their words and deeds are thoroughly examined, they are held in utmost contempt. Disaster befalls their wives and children, and calamity flows to later generations.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

**Method of Disaster from Matching Words but Not Deeds, One Hundred Forty-First**

“Since the Highest and Middle Antiquity, people have often matched words but not deeds, thus inviting disasters, harms, illnesses, and accumulated misfortunes that cannot be dispelled—thereby bringing ruin upon themselves. Therefore, I reverently received this Dao from Heaven, matching only truth and sincerity, not empty words.

Those who grasp the One and practice the Dao in my writings—though people of later ages may say daily that my Dao is harmful and of no benefit, by the next month it proves good; though they say monthly it is of no benefit, by the next year it proves good; though they say yearly it is of no benefit, by old age it remains constantly good, enduring without departure. Later generations will take it as the learning of their age. Those who do not know to act swiftly suffer only in vain, enduring hardship for a lifetime.

Thus, I instruct and admonish the Perfected Ones to be ever diligent and earnest. The Dao emerges for those of virtue; the first and the last are equally without special favor from me—I receive them all alike. Therefore, only those who obtain and strive to practice it are such people; there is no distinction between the first and the second. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Act! The Way of Heaven is impartial, returning to humanity; the virtue of Earth is selfless, bestowed upon the reverent. In human relations, there is no before or after—only love for those of true sincerity. Thus, the ancient emperors and kings had palaces to employ the virtuous, not to employ ministers without merit. The virtuous are beloved by Heaven and Earth and can assist rulers in pacifying the myriad things; the virtueless are resented by Heaven and Earth, thieves of yin and yang.”

“Why is this so weighty?”

“Are you still so foolish? The virtueless, in their countless deeds, go against Heaven and Earth—thus becoming their enemies; they disrupt yin and yang—thus becoming their thieves. Do you understand?”

“...”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go now, ask no more—good and evil may be seen for yourself.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go, for I am troubled on your behalf. Let me now distinguish and explain the conduct of people in later ages. Every person claims to be wise and well-versed in affairs, yet when their conduct is examined, it contradicts the virtue of the moon—evil. Every month, each claims to have performed good deeds and not betrayed Heaven, yet when the year is reviewed, they meet with many disasters, misfortune, and early death. In youth, each declares themselves good and greatly virtuous, surpassing even their father and mother, yet as they grow old, not one proves truly good or virtuous—all become unworthy. They share in poverty and lowliness, their lifespans grow ever shorter, and not one knows the true Way. Thus, in later ages, the good and evil, the worthy and unworthy, are revealed in this. Why must one claim to be virtuous and knowledgeable? Simply observe the signs, and you may know for yourself—discern what is enduring and true, what is real and false. Why argue further? The matter is already settled.

The true person, through my written words, shows this to awaken them, lest they remain lost in delusion for ages and incur the deep resentment of Heaven and Earth. Go now—my words here are briefly concluded. If later you have doubts, return, and we shall discuss them together.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

**Right Collection: Difficult Questions on the *Tai Ping Jue* Regarding the Sincerity or Deceit of Human Conduct**
*Collated and Combined Text of the* Tai Ping Jing*, Scrolls 94–95, Ji Section 9, Part 10*
*(Title Missing)*

The Divine Person addressed the True Person, saying: “In the earliest days of seeking the Dao, the spirit wanders yet guards softness to preserve itself. By accumulating virtue without cease, the Dao leads one to transcendence—riding clouds, mounting dragons, entering the gates of Heaven, following the celestial revolutions as if in an endless cycle.

The True Person, through single-minded devotion, attains longevity, their fate linked to Heaven. The Yang Dao, through steadfast accumulation, reaches its singular and faithful culmination. Without contending for glory or rank, one ascends to high office. By serving the teacher with filial reverence, the Dao comes of itself. The spirits then recognize one’s goodness and engage in discourse.

The teacher is the one who dispels darkness to reveal the Dao’s beginning. Ruler, father, and teacher—these are the gates of destiny under Heaven. To revere and serve these three is to invite the Dao’s great unfolding. To neglect them is to seal one’s chamber, leaving no door; all blessings and virtue flee, while calamity and chaos take pity.

Examine these matters closely, and do not stray from the written word. Parents give life, the teacher imparts its proper course, and one serves in kinship and office—how could one not be cautious? The noblest under Heaven abandon rank to pursue transcendence, for the immortal’s time is boundless, their fate linked to Heaven.

Local officials govern the people; immortal officials serve as Heaven’s officers—what business have they with the mundane? Their duties differ. Local officials govern the people and the myriad spirits; all matters under Heaven have their own lords. Strive to cultivate goodness, and your person may remain whole. Thus departing, you do not betray your ancestors.

My illustrated texts are now exhausted; nothing more remains to be set forth. Exert yourself in study, and scrutinize their words carefully.”

The Divine Person was about to depart, so he admonished the True Person: “Be cautious, be ever cautious. Do not transmit this recklessly. If the recipient is unworthy, guard against revealing it. Conceal it in the depths of the abyss, in the hidden dark, for the Dao does not drink blood, nor does it speak of essential texts. All that should be known, inner and outer, has been made clear—nothing more remains to be said.”

*Collated and Combined Text of the* Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 96, Ji Section 11*
*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll 96*

“The Six Ultimates and Six Culminations of Filial Piety and Loyalty, Scroll 151

The True Person stepped forward, saying, ‘You and I have long studied the texts of the Heavenly Dao—could we have exhausted their vast divisions and boundaries? How many divisions does our Dao comprise? What constitutes its ultimate? What marks its great culmination?’

‘Within the texts lies the Dao,’ I replied. ‘The Six Ultimates and Six Culminations—though I now speak of them, I do not know what they truly are.’

‘Alas!’ he exclaimed. ‘Your foolishness remains unopened, and your learning, though earnest, has not yet attained refinement. Thus you do not grasp where the Dao reaches its utmost.’

‘I have failed my Heavenly Master,’ I said. ‘This fault cannot be erased—I do not deny it.’

‘Why does the True Person reproach himself so severely?’

‘I have heard: if a son is unfilial, he cannot exert himself to nourish his parents; if a disciple is disobedient, he cannot devote himself to illuminating his master’s Way; if a minister is disloyal, he cannot fully respect and serve his lord. Failing in these three deeds incurs an ineradicable guilt. Heaven and Earth abhor it; ghosts and spirits harm it; all people despise it. Even in death, the blame lingers below the earth—such a one is called a son of the three unrighteous deeds. Each month’s end and new moon, he is arraigned before Heaven, which governs the rectification of yin and yang. The spirits and officials of the noble and base grieve for his soul, and this continues until his destruction.

Thus, knowing my own lack of refinement, I acknowledge my unabsolved transgression against my master.’

‘Excellent! Excellent! Where did you learn these words?’

‘From my former master. Moreover, I glimpsed the Heavenly Master’s teachings and received his methods. I saw the celestial signs: Heaven and Earth are the parents of the four seasons and five phases. If the four seasons and five phases do not exert themselves to supply what Heaven and Earth desire to generate, they are unfilial sons—such years yield few good things and become inauspicious. Humans, too, are the children of Heaven and Earth. If a child does not diligently nourish what Heaven and Earth produce, he is called an unfilial son. Thus, those who favor harsh punishments bring constant disorder, peril, and ruin to their states.

All things wax and wane with the four seasons and five phases, growing and nurturing themselves—these are their disciples. If they cannot fully follow the seasonal qi to mature and bear fruit, they are disobedient disciples. The year’s harvest harms people, and the blame is reversed. If the seasonal qi is disharmonious, the fault lies doubly with the seasons.

The people are the disciples of sages and worthies. Now, foolish disciples recklessly steal and forcefully expound, causing sages and worthies to incur blame—this is called collectively disrupting and rebelling against the Heavenly Dao. The crime is grave and unforgivable; thus, my fault remains unabsolved.

Wind and rain are the loyal ministers of Heaven and Earth. Receiving Heaven’s mandate, they distribute qi and moisture. If they fail to regulate them evenly, the world becomes unbalanced. This is like a minister receiving the emperor’s command, yet turning against his superior and favoring subordinates, using his mind unevenly. If many ministers act disloyally and deceive their ruler, the world becomes rife with contention, and the state’s governance falls into peril and chaos.

Compared to these three matters—sons who are unfilial, disciples who are disobedient, and ministers who are disloyal—none of their crimes merit pardon. Heaven detests them swiftly; Earth abhors them deeply. They are deemed grave affairs, great calamities. Ghosts and spirits condemn them, making them the most vile and base of deeds.’

‘Ah!’ he sighed. ‘The True Person has long concealed wisdom, feigning foolishness, causing me to speak recklessly—my words have overstepped Heaven and Earth. What I have said does not compare to the depth and breadth of your present words.’

‘My thoughts have merely reached this point,’ I replied. ‘I can say no more.’

‘Great humility! Yet even this is not excessive. To be lowly without humility—such a fault is also grave.’

‘Indeed, indeed—I dare not, I dare not. As a disciple, I cannot clarify the boundaries of the master’s Way. Knowing my fault is grave, I have spoken of the celestial signs to reproach myself.’

‘Excellent! Your words leave me nothing to add.’”

“Now, comparing with your words, you have already understood—you have grasped the boundaries of the written teachings, yet in truth you have not yet attained them. Since you truly have not attained them, I shall explain them in full detail for you, arranging them in proper order with clear boundaries, so that they may never be forgotten for ten thousand generations.

The True Person has said that if a person’s three actions do not accord with cultivated goodness, their hun and po souls will face the most precise reckoning. From whom did you receive this teaching?

“It is like when the Celestial Master met with the former masters, who themselves spoke of the precepts of the Ancient True Persons. I have taken these words to heart, and have also seen them recorded in the Celestial Master’s writings, thus confirming their weight. I asked: in the time of the Ancient True Persons, were there not doubts or uncertainties about these matters?”

“Indeed, the words of the Ancient True Persons are correct—I have nothing to add.”

“Now I wish to ask the Celestial Master to clarify this meaning. Listen carefully.”

“Very well. The reckoning at the end of the month and the end of the year does not apply only to the hun and po souls of those who, in life, were unfilial, disobedient, disloyal, or committed great rebellious evils—it is the same for all spirits under Heaven and Earth.

Heaven takes fifteen days as a minor boundary, thus the moon turns back after reaching the fifteenth day. A month is taken as the middle boundary, and a year as the great boundary. Between Heaven and Earth, all spirit-essences assist Heaven in nurturing and sustaining the twelve thousand things, and thus all spirit-essences receive their allotted emoluments.

It is like worthy ministers assisting the Emperor in nurturing and sustaining the common people and the myriad things—all receive their emoluments. Therefore, following Heaven’s model, there is a minor reckoning every fifteen days, a middle reckoning every month, and a great reckoning every year.

Those with great merit are promoted and raised in rank, while those without merit are demoted or dismissed, or even punished. Those who disrupt the order are the spirits of perverse evil. The spirits of perverse evil act accordingly.

Thus, when an evil person is alive, their hun and po souls are both subject to reckoning, but the hun and po souls of good people refuse to serve them. Therefore, the disloyal, unfilial, disobedient, and disloyal are made to serve them, together disrupting Heaven’s order and defiling Heaven’s governance. Thus, their evil spirits are seized and punished, and their guests are seized and punished along with them.

It is like rebellious and evil ministers committing outrages—even their guests are implicated in their crimes. This is what it means.”

“Excellent! Excellent! I now understand.”

“Thus, from the moment of birth, as a child one must be filial, as a subject one must be loyal, and as a disciple one must be obedient. If filial piety, loyalty, and obedience never leave one’s person, then after death the hun and po souls and the spirit-essence will not be subject to reckoning. Do you understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed. How astonishing! How astonishing! Now, only through the Master’s gracious instruction have I glimpsed the vastness of Heaven’s laws and patterns. I pray you do not abandon me midway, but reveal to me the full extent of the scriptures and their divisions as they reach their destinations.”

“Very well. The general outline of your question I shall still address. If I did not speak of it, that would be called begrudging the Dao, halting the work of study and thus incurring Heaven’s displeasure.”

“Understood. Let the Six Perfected Ones be seated at ease while I distinguish their divisions for you. There are six branches under one great collection. Those who guard the One follow their kind, and from ancient times to the present, those who guard the One find their texts largely the same. The greatly worthy who see my texts and guard and practice them without ceasing, who delve into them to grasp their essential meaning—such as those who study to become filial children, those who study further to become loyal subjects, and those who study to the end of their days without pause or slackening—all may attain deliverance from the world. There are yet further methods: if one practices without ceasing, one may even penetrate the six directions and eight limits, and when all affairs are complete, what could be lacking? Above, one may then assist the virtuous Imperial Lords in harmonizing Heaven and Earth, and their grace will extend downward even to the grasses and trees. All things, from the teeming multitudes to the smallest creatures, will be perfectly ordered. Heaven and Earth will rejoice, and the Emperor will enjoy long leisure, playing the zither and singing in joy, free from all care. Do you understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“The moderately worthy who guard and practice with diligence, reflecting day and night on their meaning, may still become filial children in youth and good ministers in maturity, aiding the state in achieving great peace. The whole world will submit, and none will fail to praise them. Outwardly respectful and inwardly sincere, each will examine and correct themselves, daring not betray Heaven and Earth nor deceive their superiors. If all the worthy join together in striving to practice thus, they will enable the ruler’s governance to resemble Heaven’s, modeling their conduct on Heaven’s Way. Their kindness and love will extend downward even to the grasses and trees, the mosquitoes and gnats, all finding their proper place. Do you understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“If all people guard and study these teachings, jointly striving to practice them, yet still indulge in frivolous pleasures and cannot restrain themselves, they will cause fathers to be kind, mothers loving, children filial, wives obedient, elder brothers virtuous, and younger brothers respectful. Neighbors and villagers will all delight in doing good, no longer harboring malice or theft nor inflicting harm upon one another. When all people delight in loyalty, obedience, and filial piety, aspiring to emulate the moderately worthy and the greatly worthy, they will cease to commit evil. Each household and each person will admonish and govern themselves, thus enabling governance without punishments. When the high, the middling, and the low all practice this, the world will immediately attain peace without delay. Do you understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

**Chapter 152: Entering the Chamber to Guard the One and Know the Divine Precepts**

“Thus, the Dao of guarding the One gathers those who have guarded the One throughout past and present, assembling them by kind. The greatly worthy who exert themselves in this may transcend the world; the moderately worthy who exert themselves may become good ministers and virtuous officials to emperors and kings; even the petty who exert themselves will be free from joy and anger, and the world will harbor no resentment or blame. This is the foremost and greatest section of my writings. Fearing that the common people, long benighted in ignorance, may remain deluded and disbelieve my words, I have therefore instructed them to compare these teachings with the texts on guarding the One from past and present, grouping them by kind to serve as mutual verification.”

“Excellent, excellent! Your foolish disciple has now awakened.”

“Now, as for guarding the One: the great person who guards it finds it more than sufficient; the middling person who guards it finds it more than sufficient; even the petty person who guards it finds it more than sufficient. When all three kinds of people guard and practice it, their goodness pervades the six directions and eight distant realms, and their kindness and love are reckoned equal to Heaven and Earth. As for the most benighted fool who takes no joy in guarding and practicing it, he is called the most wicked and violent person in the world—Heaven and Earth detest him, and spirits no longer protect him.

Generally, when people over time do not together delight in what is beneficial, this is the method by which the celestial writings distinguish good and evil. Those who delight in reading and gazing upon them are known by Heaven as good people; those who are shown them yet do not wish to gaze upon them are known by Heaven as violent and wicked people. Judging people by this, not one in ten thousand will be mistaken.

I compose these writings for the Lord of Supreme Virtue, above not betraying Heaven, below not betraying Earth, and in the middle not betraying the Lord of Virtue, nor deceiving the perfected. Those who guard this and grasp its meaning have completed the Dao in its entirety. Let the Six Perfected deeply ponder its meaning—I cannot exhaustively record all its goodness.”

The One is the very throat and collar of the supreme Dao. The superior scholar delights in its virtue; the middling scholar echoes and knows it; the inferior scholar detests and reviles it. Do you understand this?

“Indeed, indeed.”

Thus, when the superior scholar attains it, great joy arises, and they cannot restrain themselves from acting upon it. When the middling scholar attains it, they cannot cease their pursuit, ever desiring to speak of it with gladness. When the inferior scholar encounters it, it becomes their greatest taboo. Observing these three types of people through my writings, the distinction between good and evil in the world becomes clear. Do you understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

This text is Heaven’s contract for rectifying the hearts of ordinary people, for eliminating the lingering disasters of inherited burdens from ancestors in the lower ages, for resolving Heaven’s afflictions, and for lifting the inherited retributions of the Lord of Supreme Virtue. Do you understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

Excellent, excellent! Go forth, for you have awakened.

**Rising:** As for the second boundary of its divisions, those who read my writings on the Dao, aligning them with past and present and arranging them by category, will grasp their essential meaning. The most worthy and enlightened will rejoice in unison and be unable to restrain themselves from doing good. They will ascend to the point of daring to enter the thatched chamber, steadfastly guarding it without fail, and will surely attain deliverance from the world and depart. Their aspirations will merge completely with the divine spirits, and they will no longer be praised for worldly affairs. Their goodness will thoroughly permeate Heaven and Earth, and their spirit will assist Heaven and Earth, aiding the emperor in transforming evil. Their grace will extend downward to the smallest blades of grass and the most minute creatures, none failing to be enveloped in their virtuous transformation. Thus, the wise and virtuous teachers of antiquity who aided emperors in achieving Great Peace were all such people.

**Halt:** Therefore, their words and deeds are entirely in accord with goodness and loyalty. This is the excellence of the Dao they received from their teachers. Do you, Perfected One, understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

Within this...

**〈Rise〉** Those of middling virtue shall join their efforts to study my scriptures, aligning them with the Daoist texts of past and present, arranging them by category and studying them without cease. Those of worthy talent among them may ascend to become the emperor’s good ministers and virtuous officials, aiding the virtuous ruler in transforming evil, their grace extending downward to the smallest blades of grass and the most minute creatures. Yin and yang will harmonize, and there will be no more warfare. The emperor will wander at leisure without cares, while all his ministers and subordinates will instruct and assist one another, none failing to act in accord with goodness and loyalty. Governance will proceed without punishments, and their virtue will be too vast to record in full. Do you, Perfected One, understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

**〈Rise〉** If all the common people together study my scriptures and Daoist texts, with high and low communicating as one, uniting their plans and strategies into a single whole, none will know how to commit wickedness. They will collate and compare the Daoist texts of past and present, arranging them by category to illuminate one another, and take them as the learning of the age, passing them down from father to son without end. If the three ranks—great worthies, middling worthies, and lesser worthies—and the common people all engage in divination by these means, the malign qi of Heaven and Earth will be entirely dispelled, and there will be no more calamities of inherited burdens. Virtue will harmonize yin and yang, the auspicious qi of Heaven and Earth will emerge in full, and they will roam through the emperor’s capital—this is the sign that the August Heaven and Earthly Soil are pleased and delighted. Therefore, those who study my texts should examine them with utmost care.

**〈Halt〉** From the highest to the lowest, ponder their essential meaning, grasp their secrets, and you will differ not at all from the divine spirits. Do you, Perfected One, understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

**〈Rise〉** As for the three ranks of attainment: those who attain the Dao will frequently encounter divine powers and be able to employ them. The most worthy and enlightened among them will govern with perfect success in ten out of ten cases and may serve as the emperor’s ministers, driving away evil and dispelling wickedness. Some, after a long time, may again enter the thatched chamber and depart this world, no longer praised for worldly affairs. Thus, only after guarding the One will one fully know the locations of good and evil, transgressions and errors; only then can one guard the Dao. Only after entering the thatched chamber to cultivate refinement can one guard the spirits—this is the third rank. The worthy will collate and compare the divine scriptures of past and present to verify one another. Do you, Perfected One, understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

Those of middling virtue who guard the One and enter the Dao will also personally perceive the spirits. They will govern with nine successes in ten cases and may become the great ministers of kings and marquises, jointly driving away and eliminating evil. After a long time, they too may hope to enter the thatched chamber. Do you, Perfected One, understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

Those of lesser virtue who guard the One, enter the Dao, and study the scriptures may also perceive the spirits. They will govern with eight successes in ten cases and may join the common people in driving away evil and dispelling wickedness. They too should collate and compare the Daoist texts of past and present to verify one another. Only then will the foolish become enlightened and fully comprehend and believe in the Dao.

**〈Halt〉** If one merely reads a single scroll without such verification, one will surely fail to believe. One may even speak against it and explain it away, allowing evil to flourish daily and harm people. **〈Rise〉** But if the great worthies, middling worthies, lesser worthies, and common people all guard the divine Dao and act accordingly, then the spirits of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons will all arise, and evil will vanish of itself. Do you, Perfected One, understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

In this way, the spirits of Heaven above and Earth below, of the four directions, the six directions, and the six relations will all be pleased and greatly arise to assist people in auspiciousness, **〈Halt〉** dispelling evil and harm. Above, they will eliminate disasters and illnesses for the emperor; in the middle, they will remove sicknesses for the worthy; below, they will dispel malign qi for the common people, preventing malevolent ghosts and spirits from acting.

“Excellent! Excellent! There must be great secrets and precepts for encountering the spirits and divining affairs.”

“To say ‘ten successes in ten cases’ is to be in accord with the spirits of Heaven. To say ‘nine successes in ten cases’ is to be in accord with the spirits of Earth. To say ‘eight successes in ten cases’ is to be in accord with the spirits of humanity. Those below this level are not to be employed. Some may initially perceive the spirits and achieve perfect accord, but over time their success may decline—this is because the divine Dao is testing them, causing their failures. If they see this and renew themselves, striving to correct their errors and become more refined, without evil intentions, their conduct will daily improve. If they align with the spirits’ intentions, they may again achieve perfect success, or exceed ten, or hit ten out of ten. Those who daily improve in their successes are those who daily strive for goodness and grasp the meaning of the Dao. Thus, it is called ‘advancement.’ Using this to divine for oneself, one will not err in ten thousand cases.

Some may initially encounter the spirits and fail in divination, but later their successes will daily improve—these are people who refine themselves in the Dao and daily advance in accord with the spirits’ intentions. Others may remain as they were, neither advancing nor retreating—these are people whose refinement is insufficient. Those who daily decline are the indolent. Divining by these means, one will not grasp the meaning of the Dao. If one is tested and fails to awaken, stubbornly persisting in evil, the various spirits will jointly deceive them, leading them into evil paths. This will result in unpredictable fortunes, or falling into delusive words, or being afflicted with illness. Therefore, whether great worthies, middling worthies, lesser worthies, commoners, men, or women, all who practice the Dao should use this to divine for themselves and will not err—this is how the divine Dao tests people.

All affairs under Heaven are tested through failure. Heaven and Earth test people, so people, emulating Heaven and Earth, also test one another. Do you, Perfected One, understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

If you wish to further understand the great proof of trustworthiness: when the Dao of Heaven, the divine spirits, and the people are in accord, their hearts unite, and utmost sincerity and trust prevail. If they are not in accord, they deceive one another. Thus, the people of high antiquity were sincere and trusting, in accord with one another, so superiors and inferiors did not deceive one another. The people of middle antiquity were half in accord, so they half deceived one another. The people of low antiquity were entirely untrusting, so superiors and inferiors made deception their sole business. Thus, in high antiquity, all undertakings succeeded; in middle antiquity, half succeeded; in low antiquity, none succeeded—hence peril and ruin.

Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity constantly used this to divine for themselves whether they were in accord or not, so they never erred. With this, I admonish you, Perfected One: I see that you are often wearied by toil, and so I deeply caution you, for you are the eternal emissary of Heaven and Earth. You resolve the flowing calamities of Heaven and Earth and remove harms for the ruler—your merit is vast and nearly unmatched. I fear you may grow lax in the Dao, and so I use these numinous matters to warn you. You are the emissary of Heaven and Earth, and when the days are auspicious, it is because you have attained the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth; when the days are inauspicious, baleful, and ill, it is because you have lost the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth. When you commune with the spirits of the Dao and the days are auspicious and good, it is because you have attained the heart-mind of the Dao; when the days are inauspicious and baleful, it is because you have lost the heart-mind of the Dao. When you interact with others and the days grow increasingly kind and good, it is because you are in accord with their heart-minds; when they turn inauspicious, baleful, and cold, it is because you have lost accord with their heart-minds.

It is like tilling a field: when the grain you harvest is plentiful and fully ripened, it is because your heart-mind was attentive and your effort great; when the grain you harvest is scant and poorly ripened, it is because your heart-mind was lax and your effort slight. Even mere plants and trees respond to the heart-mind of the cultivator, their goodness or ill depending on the measure of effort and toil—how much more so with Heaven, Earth, the divine spirits, and humankind? Can you not be cautious?

Perfected One, this is the admonition: though it may seem slight and insignificant, ponder it deeply, and it will become profoundly weighty. This is precisely what is called the gateway to peace or peril, good fortune or ill. Do you understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

“I, foolish as I am, have awakened—how solemn the charge, how solemn the charge!”

“Now, the virtuous and enlightened, as sovereigns of supreme virtue, compile and collate the writings of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, arranging them by category and cross-verifying their proofs. Thus the Dao is rectified in a single day, no different from the sun and moon. They further gather and assemble the oral testimonies, oral instructions, and affairs of great worthies, middling worthies, lesser worthies, and all people—men and women alike—arranging them by category and again cross-verifying their proofs. The written texts then align perfectly, as if matching compass and square without the slightest deviation. The strategies of Heaven, Earth, and humankind converge as one. In this way, the sentiments of Heaven, Earth, and humankind are all encompassed, and the twelve thousand things follow likewise. Therefore, the sovereign of virtue must strive to employ this method.

Then, in a single day, disasters and harms will depart, and the world will govern itself. No remnant of perverse texts or perverse words will remain; all will be pure and rectified, leaving no trace of perverse qi. For perverse texts and perverse words are the root of calamity.

If you wish to further verify their clarity and trustworthiness, consider this: if someone records perverse texts to present to the sovereign, or if someone utters perverse words to slander another, resentment and blame will arise daily. Many people will likewise resent and slander one another, and the sovereign will heed them. Thus, true discernment is lost, and one fails to comprehend, incurring the disapproval of Heaven and Earth. Inauspicious words bring peril. Moreover, those below will use perverse texts and perverse words to deceive and confuse their superiors. Over time, when this is discovered above, sovereign and ministers will blame one another. Thus, perverse texts and perverse words arrive daily, serving as the gateway to misfortune and evil. Therefore, one must exert great effort to collate and eliminate them.

Perfected One, do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

Thus, a virtuous sovereign exhaustively employs upright words, and since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the calamities of inherited burdens are entirely dispelled, with no further disasters or harms. Perfected One, do you wish to further comprehend its great truth?

For upright texts and upright words are the true root and origin of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things. Therefore, the great sages and worthies of high antiquity acted in accordance with upright texts and upright words, and Heaven and Earth were rectified for them, the Three Luminaries were rectified for them, the four seasons and five phases were rectified for them, and the people and all things were rectified for them. Thus, upright texts and upright words are the great proof and true root of the rectification of Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things.

Do you wish to further clarify and understand their truth? It is like when someone employs upright texts and upright words to praise another before the sovereign, and the sovereign thereby attains great discernment and great comprehension. In all affairs, nothing is lost from the upright. Above and below thus attain the will of Heaven and Earth, the Three Luminaries do not deviate from their courses, the four seasons and five phases do not err, and the people are all joyful, all saying, “Excellent!” The myriad things each attain their proper place. Grace pervades the spirits, and one’s fame spreads to distant lands. The host of spirits and auspicious omens manifest in delight, and the worthies and scholars of the world all gladly come to assist the sovereign. The treasury is not sealed, and immortals and divine spirits bring the formulas of agelessness to them. Portents and omens are extinguished for them, and the people act on their behalf. When upright texts and upright words no longer give rise to mutual resentment, then blame and grievance are cut off. All goodness in the world emerges, while all perversity and evil conceal themselves. The virtuous sovereign need only sit with folded arms to govern of itself—what worry of peril or ruin could there be? This is the clear proof and effect of my upright texts and upright words as the root of goodness. How could one not strive to uphold the upright?

Perfected One, do you understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

How astonishing! Having heard the Heavenly Master’s words, I have already awakened greatly, and this foolish student now knows the world is already at great peace. If the virtuous sovereign heeds and employs them, they have already prolonged their life.”

“Excellent! You may be called a student who comprehends matters—you have already penetrated them thoroughly. How joyous! How joyous! The Heaven’s anxieties are already resolved, the Earth’s afflictions already removed. Perfected One, how do you know this?”

“Indeed, all perversity and evil should now be seen as gone, and the great afflictions of Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things have already been removed. Now that the upright texts and upright words have been gathered and rectified, I know the great afflictions of Heaven and Earth have already been removed.”

“Excellent! Excellent! You have already □□ understood this. If the emperor and king vigorously practice my texts, they will be in harmony with Heaven and Earth, and no further calamities will befall them. Excellent! Excellent! These are the crucial words spoken to the Perfected One. When a sovereign of supreme virtue obtains my texts, Heaven’s patterns and images will serve as their ministers—from divine beings above to the lowliest and most humble below, all nine ranks of people: divine, perfected, immortal, Daoist, sage, worthy, common folk, servants, and bondservants. Among these nine ranks, those who possess true faith and loyalty, who delight in the true and good Dao, and come to assist the virtuous sovereign—inquire into their abilities and employ them, taking care never to assign them duties unsuited to their station, nor to dismiss them unjustly. This is called the ‘earnest and devoted heart of those who oppose.’ Heaven is not partial to any person; it merely relies on and employs them according to their capacities. If each is asked about their particular strengths, then nothing will remain ungoverned. The virtuous sovereign should test them: promote those who daily demonstrate good results, taking care not to lose them, and swiftly dismiss those who show no results. This is called ‘defiling and disrupting the heavenly offices,’ preventing the upright qi from arriving—the fault lies with these perverse people. As for the truly good and upright, their hearts always desire to secretly assist and worry over all matters, which is why they bring about the arrival of good and upright people. The perverse, however, harbor perverse hearts and do not desire to secretly assist or benefit any matter, thus bringing about perversity. This is the natural standard and law of August Heaven. Therefore, they must be dismissed at once. If they are not dismissed, they will anger Heaven, causing the Earth’s killing qi to emerge. Thus, they must be swiftly removed—this is a matter of great importance. Perfected One, do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“This foolish one fears it greatly.”
“That you know to fear it—this may be called understanding the matters of life. Heaven will then protect you.”
“I dare not, I dare not.”
“There is no need for modesty here. It is not I who cause you to be protected by Heaven, but your own goodness that naturally brings this about. Thus, the sages of antiquity in their conduct dared not deviate from the plumb line, for they observed Heaven’s warnings and clearly knew good from evil, each for their own person. Therefore, they constantly sought to govern with the worthy, ever fearful of angering Heaven. To offend Heaven is to have no place for prayer.

For this reason, the ancient sage-kings, their hearts bright and penetrating, dared not recklessly employ the foolish in their service, and so they alone enjoyed enduring good fortune. Perfected One, do you understand?”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“Since the middle antiquity, half of humanity has been foolish, regarding selection and appointment as a trivial matter. Without careful examination, half of those chosen are unfit, half disrupt the heavenly offices, and governance is half inauspicious. In later antiquity, inheriting the carelessness of the middle era, they further allowed matters to become easy, failing to examine closely. Thus, in selection and appointment, they often do not obtain the right people. Defiling and disrupting the heavenly offices, the Three Luminaries become unbalanced, and evidence appears in the heavens—Heaven is displeased. Hence, inauspicious years never cease, and when they do cease, they arise again. Yet Heaven deeply resents and detests this, while people do not deeply examine themselves, instead blaming the times and fate.

Such was the case in antiquity. The Dao of Heaven is not human; they reverse matters, attributing their excesses to Heaven above. The foolish below do not reflect on their own faults but repeatedly join together to shift blame onto the emperor. Heaven thus names these ‘the great rebellious people,’ for the fault lies below, deceiving those above, calling evil good and good evil, together bringing about these disasters, then shifting blame upward to Heaven. Those who shift blame to Heaven then further reproach their ruler, making the realm’s worthless and treacherous ministers and people utterly reckless.

Now, the spirits of Heaven and Earth together detest and abhor them. Thus, Heaven personally intervened, sending me down to be the Virtuous Lord and create new laws. In selecting and appointing people to office, one cannot but be cautious and thorough. Perfected One, do you wish to know the true nature of these wicked ministers and people? It is like a family where parents have several children, and the children together deceive their parents, behaving wickedly. The parents sit silently in a room at home, yet know of their children’s violent and thieving deeds. But others instead join together to blame the parents: ‘The parents are evil, hence they bore evil children.’

When the county officials apprehend them, they do not justly execute the wicked children but instead repeatedly blame the parents. Yet when parents bear children, they all delight in their worthiness and goodness—when would they ever delight in their children behaving wickedly? To instead blame the parents is to be the most rebellious and unfilial of children.

Now, when a ruler employs ministers, he delights in their goodness—when would he ever teach them to be wicked? Yet the ministers and people below together commit violent and evil deeds, and when Heaven and Earth bring calamities, they instead shift blame to their ruler, causing the common people to suffer hardship. Thereupon, the crafty officials also join together to reproach Heaven, calling this ‘ministers and people together committing rebellion.’ The crime cannot be absolved. Together they reproach their ruler to the utmost, and this should bring great upheaval. Yet they further blame Heaven above and Earth below. Such is the rebellion of humanity—how can their lives not be cut short and swiftly ended?

Thus, in later antiquity, all were subject to the mandate of hegemons, and life and death came without warning. It is like a household wishing to slaughter livestock: if they suddenly wish to kill them, they kill them. Even good livestock are pitied in death, while evil livestock are delighted to die of illness. Perfected One, do you understand?”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“Foolish mortals greatly fear Heaven’s majesty.”
“Excellent, you have awakened. Bring forth this text and let the virtuous ruler show it to all worthy scholars—take care not to conceal it, for Heaven urgently delights in its revelation.”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“Let me impart to you, Perfected One, a matter of great importance: when rulers of great virtue and their ministers each attain their rightful place, aligning with the heart of Heaven, then they must know the arts of governing the people and eliminating harm. Yet those who lurk in distant regions are exceedingly difficult to discern. The benighted masses, each seeking their own advantage, instead conspire to deceive their superiors. The virtuous ruler must, together with the wise and enlightened, correct this—only when all is rectified does it accord with the will of Heaven and Earth, bringing them great joy and ensuring the emperor’s enduring fortune.

Heaven, in its wisdom, knows that the people of later antiquity are foolish and difficult to govern; thus, it deliberately produced these written documents, naming them *Heavenly Scriptures*. The nature of writing is to make manifest and to clarify. All under Heaven use it to record affairs, and what is recorded must be universally practiced—it may be used to preserve the literary works of all people. Therefore, written texts are what all under Heaven ought to read together, not for the sake of a single, solitary individual. Thus, all under Heaven use writing to record all matters; sages use it to record the patterns of Heaven and Earth, and the worthy use it to preserve the words of sages. Only when ordinary people study and read these texts together do they afterward grasp their meaning.

The categories of writing are such that they must be collectively examined, collectively deliberated, collectively recorded, and collectively recited—only then can deceit be eliminated. Yet from ancient times to the present, how many revisions have the writings of sages undergone? How many transmissions? How many verifications? How many have been collectively preserved? And still, there remain superfluous, erroneous words that cannot be uniformly applied. Thus, great worthies and masters of the Dao traverse the world, scrutinizing words and studying speech, comparing differences to enlighten the ignorant. Yet even so, errors persist, misleading the innocent and causing them to speak recklessly of their learning—such recklessness renders them unfit to serve as ministers to emperors and kings.

Thus, when a single original text diverges into many variant passages, the Dao of Heaven and Earth falls into great disorder and confusion, giving rise to the disasters of *chengfu*. Perfected One, do you understand?”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“Excellent, you have awakened. Now listen further, and I shall tell you of one great precept. The reason people of later ages have long lost the favor of Heaven, causing Heaven and Earth to remain ever disconsolate, is that rulers rely on solitary words and isolated judgments, verifying matters without truth, and thus greatly miss the clarity of their intent. Perfected One, if this persists, even when all the worthy under Heaven collectively examine the words and texts, they will still err in their learning. Hence, calamities and anomalies arise unceasingly, and Heaven deeply abhors this, giving rise to chaos, illness, and the unceasing struggle of yin and yang.

Thus, Heaven commanded me to descend and correct these errors through careful collation. Since the Great Middle Antiquity, people have trusted solitary words and isolated judgments, deeming texts that review or challenge authority as disrespectful. They collectively use this as a standard for blame, and so, relying on solitary words and isolated judgments, they respond and submit documents to govern affairs—thereby incurring Heaven’s resentment and disorder. The celestial documents and records were originally meant for people to collectively deliberate on right and wrong, yet now they allow one person to secretly compose the words.

Even sages cannot alone fully comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the works of sages and worthies across generations differ, for Heaven has said that each excels in but one aspect and cannot entirely eliminate disasters. Therefore, I was commanded to gather and collate them all. Now, to trust the words of a single person—how can this be acceptable? Thus, I teach the Three Dao Methods of circulating documents, wherein the great and the small, the worthy and the unworthy, men and women, all intermingle, collectively deliberating on right and wrong, ensuring that all attain the truth of the matter □□ before it may be elevated.

If one among them seeks to deceive, it is immediately recorded. In this way, the illnesses of Heaven and Earth are eradicated, and emperors and kings are freed from the burdens of *chengfu*. Then:

Heaven and Earth, freed from illness, rejoice;
emperors and kings, secure in their rule, rejoice;
the worthy, able to fulfill their potential, rejoice;
the common people, freed from unjust suffering, their households prosperous and their needs met, rejoice;
servants and maids, finding good masters and refraining from wrongdoing, rejoice;
the four seasons and five phases, flowing in harmony, with the people reverent and untransgressive, rejoice;
the myriad creatures, each in its proper place and unharmed, rejoice;
ghosts and spirits, seeing the virtuous ruler accumulate goodness, also rejoice;
evil *qi* no longer ascends to obscure the sun, moon, and Three Luminaries, rejoicing;
the Supreme Peaceful *qi* comes to govern, and the king’s rule is effective, rejoicing;
evil *qi*, once subdued and hidden, no longer manifests to incite punitive expeditions, rejoicing;
the barbarians, settled in their lands, no longer frequently wage war against Heaven, rejoicing;
generals and soldiers, their weapons at rest and unused, their troops spared from death in battle, rejoice.

In all between Heaven and Earth, such joys are too numerous to record. I, Perfected One, have raised only the great outlines and shown their beginnings; ponder their meaning yourself. For all matters, infer by analogy, and you will fully comprehend them. When a virtuous ruler implements this, all under Heaven will submit.”

Thus, Heaven urgently emphasizes the practice of these Three Daoist Writs—take heed never to abandon them, lest disasters persist. To sever the celestial patterns is to revert to governance by the deaf and blind. Such governance is the root of chaos and peril, the calamity that destroys the self. How could one not be cautious?

Now, these writs are what all under Heaven must jointly examine and practice; they cannot be trusted to the words of a single person. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, texts and human discourses have been transmitted and cross-examined to verify their clarity. Without such verification, they cannot be practiced alone. To act solely on one person’s words is to court danger and ruin—this is the great loss and harm of all under Heaven.

Therefore, my writings dare not tolerate solitary words or isolated phrases. I instruct the Perfected One to collate and compare texts from the High, Middle, and Low Antiquities to illuminate them, and to gather and verify the discourses of all people under Heaven to confirm their covenants. Only then can all between Heaven and Earth be rectified, and the interactions of *yin* and *yang* remain free of disorder.

Examine ancient and modern celestial patterns, earthly spirit-writs, and human discourses with my writings, and they will surely resonate like an echo, no different from the divine. Thus, my Dao may be trusted. For my Dao does not rely on untested words; it seeks to be put into practice. How else could one know whether my Dao aligns with Heaven and is trustworthy? Today, if you practice it, it is as though you converse with Heaven—ten out of ten, fifteen out of fifteen, with no omissions. How wondrous is the Dao when thus practiced! Truly, it may be called the greatest joy. Does the Perfected One understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

Go forth, and you will enlighten the living. I impart to you, Perfected One, a great secret: this begins with guarding the One and focusing on goodness to grasp its meaning, thereby entering the Dao. Thus, I follow it with the Daoist writs. To practice the Dao is to arrive at the inner chamber, to enter the true Dao, and to enter the chamber, one must know the divine. Thus, I follow it with the divine precepts.

Having guarded the One, attained the Dao, and obtained the divine, one may ascend to become a virtuous ruler or a worthy minister. Ministers must assist the virtuous ruler to jointly pacify the six directions and eight caverns of Heaven and Earth. Grasping their meaning, the state may enjoy long-lasting peace. To achieve this peace, one must rectify texts, discourses, and words. Thus, by collating and verifying texts and discourses, great rectification is achieved. Only then will the multitude of worthy and superior scholars emerge to jointly assist the ruler, serving as his keen ears, bright eyes, and strong limbs. Thus, I follow it with the nine ministerial offices. When the nine each fulfill their roles, they will jointly pacify Heaven and Earth, and all under Heaven will unite in strength and purpose as one.

They must constantly communicate, reporting good and evil to one another. Thus, I follow it with the Three Daoist Writs. Once all know to guard the One, have entered the Dao, attained the divine, and embraced correct texts, then, with the hierarchy of ministers each in their proper place, and having practiced the writs, they will unite in the six affairs. Having reached completion, all under Heaven will share one heart, with none daring to harbor hatred. All will love and benefit one another as though born of the same parents. Thus, the virtuous ruler deeply aligns with Heaven’s will, delighting in the absence of strife.

Fearing omissions in the Dao that might leave the celestial and earthly texts incomplete, I further append the *Great Collection of Difficulties* to resolve doubts. The profound are placed below, and the complete writings are revealed, entrusted to the virtuous ruler. Should all under Heaven suddenly turn to reckoning, goodness will govern itself. This is as effortless as fire spreading to high and dry places, or water flowing downward—unbidden, it proceeds naturally, unstoppable.

Thus, the transformative teachings of the Supreme August Heavenly Dao may be awaited. When the virtuous ruler practices them, he is called the divine son of Heaven, styled the Supreme August, akin to the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, all spirits under Heaven may be commanded. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, there has never been a celestial writ or divine text like this, transmitted by the Perfected One as a record of the true Dao. Entrusted to the virtuous ruler, it is called the Mother of the Dao.

The *qi* of the Great Yang, the fire phase, exists within it. To practice it is to attain its truth; to fail to practice it is to lack authenticity. Does the Perfected One understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

“With utmost sincerity, I entrust the people to you, to be delivered to the virtuous ruler without delay. I dare not retain it long.”

“Go, for you have understood. The celestial writ must not be kept long. Heavenly spirits examine men, and prolonged possession brings misfortune. Be cautious and depart.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

Six investigations thoroughly penetrate the seven ultimate boundaries, arranging texts by category so they correspond, eradicating all disasters and calamities, thereby manifesting the auspicious writ of utmost profundity.

**The Great Precept of Enduring Humility, Emulating Heaven and Earth, and Harmonizing with the Spirits (253rd)**

The Perfected One spoke: “Come forward.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now I shall impart to you a great precept. Rise—

Our Dao is for governing Heaven and Earth, pacifying emperors and kings, and giving life to those beloved by Heaven and Earth. Thus, one must cherish the true Dao and true virtue. Therefore, Heaven is the truth of the Dao, the warp of the Dao, the fidelity of the Dao, the condition by which the Dao proceeds. Earth is the chief of virtue, the weft of virtue, the condition by which virtue abides. Thus, it endures as the mother of the myriad things, constantly enduring humiliation by dwelling below, never boasting of its toil or hardship.

In teaching the ignorant as the virtuous ruler, I take these two matters of Heaven and Earth as the foundation. Therefore, one must always follow the laws of Heaven and Earth, never deviating from their gate and threshold. My writings are the words of Heaven and the speech of Earth, deeply and uniquely resonating with the spirits as if inner and outer. Halt—proceeding step by step, they follow as if compass and square.

Thus, those who act in accord obtain the intent of Heaven and Earth; those who lose it meet with misfortune and decline. Now I precept you, Perfected One—you should ponder my words and ever be cautious.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Go. Seeing your devotion to the true Dao and virtue, your goodness unmatched, I shall reveal one further word to you. Now, the superior person delights greatly in the true Dao and good virtue; the middling person is half-inclined toward them; the inferior person, devoid of form, is utterly without Dao and virtue—all are those who commit great rebellion, the people of utmost misfortune and devoid of virtue. Such people, within Heaven and Earth, stand utterly apart, unknown and unrecognized, not those Heaven habitually pardons or loves. Thus, those without Dao and virtue have no destiny under Heaven and Earth; their fate and fortune are the same as birds and beasts.”

“Now I do not understand. I wish to hear the essential meaning.”

“”

“Now then, the Six Perfected Ones, listen clearly.”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now, Heaven is purely of the Dao; Earth is purely of virtue. These people devoid of Dao and virtue are utterly cut off from Heaven and Earth, without any likeness. Those who take Heaven as their model should possess the true Dao and delight in giving life; those who take Earth as their model should possess good virtue and delight in nurturing growth. Now, people without Dao and without virtue—thus Heaven and Earth do not pardon them. If you wish to know the clear proof of this, compare it to those of the Dao recognizing others of the Dao, and those of virtue recognizing others of virtue: each naturally gathers and embraces their own, so their destinies are mutually bound. Thus, those of the Dao delight in elevating others of the Dao; those of virtue delight in elevating others of virtue. Those with Dao and virtue do not align with those without Dao and virtue, and so they do not gather or embrace them—thus their destiny is not bound to Heaven.”

“Excellent! Excellent! I wish to hear the meaning of their destiny being the same as birds and beasts.”

“Excellent is your question, for you deeply grasp the principle. Now, the destiny of birds and beasts is bound to the four directions; their nature delights in clashing, devoid of Dao and virtue, and the stronger prevails. The foolish people devoid of Dao and virtue also delight in clashing and overstepping, and the stronger prevails. Their qi is the same as that of birds and beasts—thus their destiny is the same. The Dao of Heaven serves as the law, by which the superior and inferior of people are distinguished—thus it is known.

Generally, the names and destinies of all under Heaven follow their kind, so their destined category is known. Thus, those who embody the Five Natures in abundance resemble yang and are benevolent; those who embody the Six Emotions in abundance resemble yin and are greedy. Those who receive more yang endowment become male; those who receive more yin endowment become female. Those who receive the qi of prosperous and dominant phases become noble, honored, and long-lived; those who receive the qi of waning, declining, and imprisoned phases suffer frequent illness, die early, and are utterly impoverished.

Thus, for all people born, their destiny is bound to the qi of the phase they resemble and to the cyclical progression of the Six Jia. By categorizing accordingly, not one in ten thousand is misjudged. Therefore, the sages of antiquity deeply investigated all matters and understood human nature by this means. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed. Excellent! Excellent!”

Now, the people of this later age bear the burden of their ancestors' miscalculations, gradually severing the Dao and virtue together. Day by day, over long accumulation, they cut themselves off from Heaven and Earth, their essence and qi no longer flowing through. Unaware of their destined fate, they instead share the same lot as four-footed creatures. Thus, Heaven and Earth detest them, and the qi of spirits and gods no longer protects them. They suffer countless illnesses, meet untimely deaths, and their greatest fault lies in this...

Now, the ruler of supreme virtue, whose destiny is bound to Heaven and Earth, must model himself upon them and govern through the Dao and virtue. Therefore, I have reordered and revealed the celestial Dao to bestow upon him. Heaven delights in his goodness and does not wish him to act as those four-footed people do. Thus, I reiterate and emphasize these writings, desiring that he awaken fully. Therefore, I have compiled the *Six Ultimates* and the *Great Collection of Difficulties* to entrust to him. Do you, Perfected One, understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed. How astonishing! How joyous! How joyous!”

“Perfected One, how do you know what is astonishing and joyous?”

“When I, foolish as I am, hear the Celestial Master speak of the true Dao and virtue emerging, the people will turn in a single day, all upholding the Dao and virtue, modeling themselves upon Heaven and Earth, no longer acting as four-footed creatures. Each person will follow the Way, each will embody virtue—thus I know the great joy of this intent.”

“Excellent, Perfected One! Your words are beyond improvement.”

“Now, with your permission, Celestial Master, I wish to ask one matter.”

“Speak.”

“When people seek the Dao and virtue or engage in ordinary conduct, what should be their most urgent task? How can they come to know it? How can they resonate in response with Heaven and Earth?”

“Excellent is your question! They must act with utmost sincerity, with the five inner organs genuine and true—only then can they attain it. If they do not act with the five inner organs genuine and true, they incur the resentment of the Dao and virtue. Seeking goodness will be in vain, and the spirits will not respond.”

“Now, I wish to hear how utmost sincerity moves Heaven, Earth, and the gods.”

“Alas! Perfected One, in this you are particularly unenlightened. Have you not yet fully grasped the texts I have taught?”

“Foolish as I am, my obscurity runs deep, and it is difficult to suddenly illuminate it.”

“Yet you are overly modest. Listen carefully, and I will explain the meaning of utmost sincerity moving Heaven and Earth.”

“Indeed, I heed your instruction.”

“Now, utmost sincerity is so named because when one looks up and acts in accordance with the celestial Dao, it is attainable; when one looks down and acts in accordance with the virtue of Earth, it is transformative. One reflects that Heaven and Earth, like parents, gave me life and do not wish me to delight in evil. One examines this in the heart before acting. The heart is the most revered spirit within, the sacred and purely yang, aligned with the movement of fire. Fire rises and ascends, sharing the radiance of Heaven. Thus, the sun is the ruler of fire, the essence of Heaven, illuminating all without exception. Therefore, when one acts with utmost sincerity, the heart’s rectitude responds with urgency. The spirit of the heart, most sacred, ascends to report to the sun, and the sun reports to Heaven. Thus, utmost sincerity within the five inner organs moves the spirits. How can one not be cautious?”

The Perfected One said, “How awe-inspiring! How awe-inspiring! My foolish questions have stirred great fear.”

“If you know fear, it is the root of life; if you do not know fear, it is the gate of death. Safety and peril lie within you, not elsewhere.”

“Though each time I ask the Celestial Master, I am struck with fear, yet to ask is to receive the great resolution, while not asking leaves no means to know it.”

“Indeed, your words are true. If one remains in darkness and does not ask, when will clarity ever come? Speak—what else do you wish to ask?”

“Having already heard how utmost sincerity moves Heaven, I now wish to hear how it moves Earth.”

“Excellent! Your words grow ever deeper, and you spare nothing in your inquiry. Sit calmly, and I will explain it to you. If I do not speak, I fear I will fail you. It is as if Heaven itself grieves that later generations lack utmost sincerity and has sent you, Perfected One, to pose these questions. Very well. Now I will tell you.”

“Listen clearly.”

“Yes, yes.”

“Now then, when a person’s utmost sincerity takes hold of a thought, the heart feels such pain that one cannot eat. What is thought? It is the heart and the mind. When the heart and mind do not forget, the liver—most benevolent of organs—acts as their master, and the eyes shed tears. This is the utmost sincerity of concentrated thought. The heart is the essence of clarity. To think without ceasing is the work of the mind and the spleen. The heart is pure yang, its position belonging to Heaven. The spleen is pure yin, its position belonging to Earth. When utmost sincerity is focused in thought, the heart aches and tears flow. The heart commands the mind to direct the thought, sending word to distant places. The mind is yin; when yin harbors sorrow, it must report to yang, thus ascending to inform the divine spirits of august Heaven. The spleen, as yin’s dwelling on Earth, descends to report to Earth. Thus Heaven and Earth are moved, and all spirits are stirred. If you wish to know its great effect, I do not deceive you, Perfected One. Simply sit calmly in a secluded chamber, concentrate your heart and ponder the spirits—they will all come of their own accord. Is this not clear and evident proof? This is what I tell you of the truth of utmost sincerity. I have never spoken without method. Therefore, all who seek the Dao and virtue must act with utmost sincerity, for only then will Heaven and Earth respond and the divine spirits come to inform them. Without utmost sincerity, one cannot move Heaven and Earth or stir the spirits. After the era of *chengfu*, people of later ages truly lacked faith. Without utmost sincerity, they could not move Heaven and Earth, and so they deceived both together. Thus the spirits ceaselessly harmed them.”

“How may this be demonstrated?”

"Yet there is great and clear proof in the sun and moon."

"I now wish to hear of it."

"Indeed, people of later ages are born of father and mother, yet together they neglect their parents, turn their backs on their parents—among ten thousand, not one is filial. They receive enlightenment from their teachers, having awakened and departed, yet neglect their teachers and refuse to follow them, forcing their teachers to humble themselves and endure toil and hardship. Having gained wealth and nobility from their lords through poverty and lowliness, they instead turn to instruct others. All below together deceive those above; among ten thousand, not one possesses sincerity and trustworthiness. The multitude of fools collectively deceive the Three Bonds, acting in rebellion and without faith. Their transgressions are glaringly evident, impossible to conceal below, for all are seen above by the sun, moon, and Three Luminaries. Thus Heaven and Earth deeply detest and abhor them, causing them to be short-lived and die prematurely. They do not deeply reflect tenfold upon their grave transgressions but instead weep and wail as they proceed. They say Heaven is cruel—how grievously wronged they are! Yet it is you who wrong yourselves; when has Heaven ever wronged you?"

"How terrifying! Excellent, excellent!"

"Foolish one, I have received your instruction."

"Indeed, if you uphold this as a solemn warning, then for ten thousand generations you may be free from calamity. Yet as this minor discourse concludes, doubts arise once more—come, ask again."

"Very well."

---

"Truly, truly foolish and benighted, my confusion grows daily—I grasp nothing of the profound and fail to comprehend. With reverence, I bow twice and ask: if I act upon this, I shall surely err; yet if I do not ask, my foolish heart cannot resolve it alone."

"Speak your words."

"This foolish one has stealthily heard the essential meaning of the secret Dao—it is the treasure of Heaven and Earth, the rarest jewel under Heaven. Thus it is called the ‘Untransmitted Utmost Dao,’ for it is not fitting for ordinary people to hear, to speak, or to employ. Yet now the Heavenly Master has fully opened the path of Great Peace, commanding all to compose essential texts on virtue and the Dao, forbidding concealment. All are warned of Heaven’s punishment, that even unto death their crimes shall not be absolved, but will flow into later generations. Yet now all are granted the true Dao and secret powers—is this not excessive? It allows petty men to mingle with noble men without distinction. This foolish one believes the true Dao and secret powers ought not be heard by petty men, spoken by petty men, or used by petty men."

"Alas! What you have just spoken incurs ten thousand deaths’ worth of guilt before the August Heaven and Revered Earth—it shall never be absolved. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, later generations have grown ever more shallow, envying the Dao. Petty men sever the treasure of Heaven and Earth, and this is counted as loss. Over time, this gives rise to karmic inheritance, causing Heaven’s disasters to never cease. It constantly renders the world within Heaven and Earth unsettled in its years, with frequent calamities, bandits, and thieves. The state is thus plunged into sorrow and suffering—all arises from this. What you have just said is precisely the cause. You disrupt Heaven and overturn Earth, plunging governance into chaos and confusion, making the people difficult to govern—this is precisely the case. What you have just uttered deeply offends Heaven, how grievously mistaken! How grievously mistaken! Your merit is undone."

"What do you mean?"

“Now, the essential Dao and perfect virtue emerge through teaching and transformation. When petty men obtain them, they uphold the Dao and virtue, emulate one another, and dare not transgress. Among them, the lesser worthy who attain good virtue may become upright and compliant officials. The greater worthy may ascend to assist the state. Even the most ignorant and base among them may still become good people. Heaven employs the essential true Dao to give life to all things, extending even to the six domestic animals and birds. The four seasons and five phases are the true essential Dao of Heaven and Earth, the divine treasure of Heaven and Earth, the stored qi of Heaven and Earth. The six domestic animals and birds all embrace it as their nature; plants and trees obtain it and then grow. If Heaven did not bestow the complete essential Dao, how could they mutually generate and grow? Yet you, Perfected One, claim that petty men ought not hear the essential Dao, ought not speak of it, ought not employ it. Are the divine protectors of Heaven and Earth to conclude that people are less good than the six domestic animals, birds, and plants? You yourself know that what you have just said incurs a ten-thousandfold deathly offense, one that cannot be absolved.”

“This foolish student has served the Master for but a short and shallow time, and does not deeply understand the Way of Heaven. Hearing the Celestial Master’s words, I now realize my offense is grave, having failed the August Heaven above, the Earth below, and the virtuous ruler in between.”

“Indeed, your self-reproach is fitting. In all undertakings, can one not be cautious? The August Heaven alone constantly observes the words of people. Why else would echoes follow human voices to determine good or ill fortune? Thus, echoes respond without missing a fraction. Have you never observed this proof of Heaven and Earth’s resonance? You ought to be cautious where you fall short, and not recklessly utter falsehoods—such harm is grave. You have just said that the ultimate Dao is not transmitted to others. How then is it to be known? The ultimate Dao of all things cannot be transmitted. The Way of Heaven is impartial—yet for whom alone should it exist?”

“This disciple has been most remiss in caution and conduct.”

“Do you wish, like the vulgar and petty, to again obstruct and envy the Way of Heaven?”

“I dare not, I dare not.”

“Perfected One, be vigilant in your conduct. Once Heaven’s wrath is aroused, the offense will never be absolved. The Way of Heaven is precisely what your words have ruined—do you now seek to compound it? That emperors and kings cannot govern and frequently suffer disasters is entirely due to those like you. If you persist in such speech, you will cause the true Dao to be severed, heterodox ways to arise, and governance to become impossible. Do you not comprehend?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now that you have awakened, are you not ashamed before the Celestial Master? Always be cautious in your conduct.”

“Indeed, indeed. Now, whenever I speak, I fear I err. Yet if I do not speak, I remain ignorant.”

“Speak plainly.”

“What is it that people ought not hear, ought not speak of, ought not employ?”

“Indeed, people ought not hear what is not the true essential Dao, not the true essential virtue. Thus, when inferior teachers instruct petty men, they neglect to employ the essential, secret Dao and true virtue in their admonitions. Instead, they display and teach with florid, false, and cunning compositions. Among them, the greater worthy who learn such deceptive and cunning compositions proceed to deceive their rulers. The middling worthy who learn false compositions become crafty officials, flattering and deceiving their superiors above while cunningly oppressing the good and compliant people below. The inferior and petty who obtain these become devoid of principle, deceiving their parents, outwitting their neighbors, or even becoming unchecked bandits and thieves. The worthy and unworthy, officials and commoners, all engage in deceit and cannot restrain one another. Witnessing such perversity and disorder, they disrupt the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, harm the accomplishments of the five phases, and contravene the nurturing of the four seasons. Together, they deceive their superiors, plunging the state into chaos. The harm is so severe it cannot be fully recounted. Yet you, Perfected One, claim that petty men ought not hear the essential Dao and virtue, and instead should be taught with deceptive, cunning, and false matters, causing the people of the world to be deluded, to learn falsehoods, and to remain unaware, thus all becoming devoid of the Dao. This is why you, Perfected One, incur a ten-thousandfold deathly offense that cannot be absolved. What the world ought not hear, ought not speak of, ought not employ is precisely this false composition, the very source of great cunning and deceit. Therefore, I expound the law for Heaven and establish teachings for the virtuous ruler, never daring to approach such matters. I strive only to open the gate of the Dao and virtue while closing the paths of deceit and cunning. Thus, my writings are rooted in the Dao and virtue, discarding and excluding the methods of false composition and deceit, which are entirely absent. Do you not find this strange? This is what Heaven and Earth regard as affliction, what emperors and kings see as harm. I shall again explain it to you, Perfected One: employ the essential Dao and virtue to teach and transform petty men. The greater worthy may uphold goodness and integrity; the middling worthy may become the state’s most virtuous ministers; the lesser worthy may be transformed into compliant and good officials; and even the most ignorant may still become cautious people, unaware of how to harm one another. Thus, from Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, and stars, all employ the true Dao and essential virtue to nurture the myriad things—extending even to the six domestic animals, excrement, soil, and plants—all clothed in its secret Dao and essential virtue to obtain life and growth. If, as you have just said, Perfected One, this is the case, are such people not inferior to the six domestic animals, excrement, soil, and plants? In what you have just said, do you not realize you incur a ten-thousandfold deathly offense that cannot be absolved?”

“I have committed a deathly offense, a deathly offense. I simply did not understand. What now can be done about these mistaken words?”

“If you wish to absolve this offense, on the day of purification, go to an open field at a crossroads and bow in each of the four directions, kowtowing five times in each. First, look up to Heaven, then turn and kowtow to the Earth.”

“Indeed, indeed. Now, Celestial Master, why is this so urgent?”

“As for why this is so urgent, it is not because of you, Perfected One. Rather, your words have incurred the taboos of Heaven and Earth. Since the Highest Antiquity and Middle Antiquity, people have often been taught to envy the true Dao and virtuous power, instead instructing one another to flee and conceal them, sealing them away and cutting them off. They have turned to teaching perverse and cunning ways, guiding and transforming the foolish, causing them all to act wrongly.

Among them, the greatly worthy have distanced themselves to avoid the world, while only the lesser worthy serve as officials—possessing no true Dao, they bring chaos to the people. The most foolish among them, lacking the Dao, rise as bandits and thieves. Both the people and their ministers act perversely, gathering like mosquitoes to roar like thunder, together defying the celestial patterns, destroying the heavenly Dao, opposing the will of Earth, reversing the qi of the four seasons, and disrupting the Five Phases. This gives rise to countless calamities and anomalies, causing the Three Luminaries to lose their proper radiance. The emperors and kings are deeply troubled by this, falling into confusion and disorder, unable to govern in peace—all arising from this very cause.

Thus, Perfected One, do you not realize how grave this transgression is? Heaven will not absolve it. If I did not instruct you, you would bear this guilt yourself.”

Thus, one must dwell in the open wilderness, in places of clarity and brightness. The reason the Way extends in all four directions is that the Dao governs all affairs of passage. The reason it extends in all four directions is that it is entrusted to the four seasons. Heaven dispenses qi to enable you to ascend and commune with it. The four seasons, through their benevolence, give life and completion, thereby absolving your transgressions before Heaven and Earth. Those who err afterward merely imitate you. From this day forward, Heaven will severely punish those who do evil. Therefore, the noble person must always err on the side of great goodness and never on the side of great evil. Be cautious! Be cautious! If even you must act thus, how much more so the foolish common people?

Those who teach with jealousy and envy of the Dao conceal it—this is the way. What you have spoken is always good. Yet a single careless word may be called a great rebellion against Heaven and Earth, the very cause of the sorrow that rulers have known from ancient times to the present. How, then, could one become a noble person in your presence, Perfected One? It is all through learning. To learn the Dao is to become Dao-like; to learn virtue is to attain it; to learn goodness is to become good; to learn the supreme Dao and perfect virtue is to live long into old age, ever increasing in goodness and excellence.

Thus, those who embrace the essential Dao and perfect virtue are called the recluses of emperors and kings, the foremost and most excellent of people, capable of assisting the noble in their transformative work. Those who do not serve in office are the most prudent of people. But those who learn evil become evil; those who learn refinement become refined; those who learn deceit become deceitful; those who learn cunning become cunning. Among them, the most worthy may master eloquent speech, while those who study texts may craft artful prose—yet when petty men acquire such skills, they become treacherous. How can you, in your heart, not teach this?

Therefore, the essential Dao and hidden virtue are what align with the heart of Heaven and the will of Earth, enabling the long-term peace of the state and bringing joy to emperors and kings. To prohibit and suppress them instead of vigorously transforming the people is to incur Heaven’s censure, and the guilt will not be absolved.

Heaven acts through the supreme Dao; Earth dwells in perfect virtue. Together, they give life to the myriad things, without concealment or partiality. Thus, the sages of antiquity modeled their conduct on Heaven and Earth, using the supreme Dao and essential virtue to instruct the foolish, making them prudent and good, and thus easy to govern. Yet in this age, such teachings are often blocked and cut off, so the foolish collectively become cunning and deceitful, losing the heavenly Dao. Unaware of their own wrongdoing, they bring blame upon themselves because the true Dao and perfect virtue are not put into practice. Thus, many suffer Heaven’s censure, and their offenses, deserving death, remain unabsolved.

The foolish, lacking the Dao, disregard taboos and prohibitions, jointly offending Heaven and Earth because they do not know the essentials of Dao and virtue. I have written this text, repeating myself earnestly and repeatedly, fearing that people, sunk in ignorance, might not believe even a single word of my writing—hence the reiteration. Having long practiced evil, some may even call my words false. If the gate of the true Dao and hidden virtue is again severed and left unopened, Heaven’s wrath will not cease, emperors will suffer endless sorrow, officials and people will have nowhere to turn, and chaos will follow, leaving none able to save another. If you truly resent my words before Heaven, it is precisely to resolve and remove this that I have composed the Dao.

People are all entangled in perverse teachings, their ignorance deepening over time. Therefore, I have repeatedly instructed you, Perfected One, to bring forth my Dao and entrust it to a ruler of supreme morality, so that it may be shown to the worthy. Test my Dao swiftly, and you will know the truth of my writings, which resemble Heaven and Earth. Without use or trial, how could one know their [value]? Now, to ensure my Dao is not mistaken, I seek not merely a single scroll for testing.

Be cautious, Perfected One!

“Yes, yes.”

Go forth, and always heed my words. Do not treat them lightly or speak carelessly.

“Yes, yes.”

Do not conceal or hide them. Let all people, in their speech and learning, recognize where gain and loss lie, and no longer act recklessly.

“Yes, yes.”

The Right Explication: Matters the Common Person Ought Not Hear, Ought Not Speak, Ought Not Employ—Severing the Perverse to Bring Forth the True Text
Serving the Master as One Serves a Father: Essential Instructions, One Hundred Fifty-Fifth

“Now, when foolish disciples speak, their words often miss the mark of the Heavenly Master’s intent, and they are frequently subjected to severe reprimand. Yet if they do not venture to ask about their faults, even as the year draws to a close, they remain unable to comprehend them. I humbly request to ask one more question.”

“Speak plainly. Why be so modest? To ask when one does not know is but the natural course.”

“Now, when the foremost essentials of the supreme Dao and its paramount virtues are taught to ordinary people, do they not largely fail to comprehend them?”

“Excellent is your question! How could there be any great comprehension? Why do you doubt this?”

“I have heard that when a son’s wisdom surpasses his father’s, a disciple’s wisdom surpasses his master’s, or a minister’s wisdom surpasses his lord’s, this is called ‘the inferior surpassing the superior in wisdom,’ and it is deemed improper.”

“Your words are both correct and incorrect. That the inferior surpasses the superior in wisdom is indeed improper. If the inferior’s wisdom consists of cunning and deceitful methods, surpassing their superior, then they will turn and deceive that superior. Should you wish to see its effects, consider this: in teaching and learning, if a disciple of a crafty household surpasses his master in skill, he will ultimately harm his master. When those in subordinate positions study and master deceitful, treacherous ways, they will collectively confuse and deceive their superiors. Thus, the great sages of antiquity never recklessly imparted teachings of deceit, cunning, or falsehood. They always deeply contemplated the root and severed the branches, preventing foolish people from knowing such things. Therefore, those who govern a state with cunning wisdom are the state’s greatest thieves.

Thus, the sages of old always focused on transmitting the true Dao, never imparting superficial, deceptive, or manipulative methods. Knowing the profound harm they cause, they consistently closed off such pernicious learning and instead opened the path of good fortune, ensuring the people remained cautious and unaware of how to do wrong.

Should you wish to further verify this truth, consider that in the era of the Three Sovereigns, lords treated their ministers as they would their fathers. At that time, ministers each held the essentials of the true Dao and its virtues, free from deceitful, cunning, or false teachings. Thus, their wisdom all surpassed that of their lords, enabling them to serve as teachers to emperors and kings. Their instruction was like that of a father, and so they were treated as teachers and fathers. This is the principle by which virtue surpasses that of their lords. Thus, they could cause their lords to sit in tranquility, governing with ease and without worry.

Therefore, one whose words are ten out of ten correct can assist an emperor or king; one whose words are nine out of ten correct can aid a great minister; one whose words are eight out of ten correct can serve as a minor official. Those who fall below this standard are unworthy of counsel. Those whose words miss the mark are called reckless speakers, who bring confusion and error to their superiors. Do you understand?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Very well. If you wish to further understand its great effects, consider the Five Emperors: the Dao began to slightly decline, and thus the virtue and power of rulers and ministers could no longer mutually inquire of one another. Those who shared the same school became companions, those of like minds became friends, and though ruler and minister still shared knowledge, they could no longer surpass one another to any great degree. Essential teachings and secret powers became slightly obstructed and impassable, so there were none worthy of being treated as teachers or fathers—only as friends.

By the time of the Three Kings, those who transmitted teachings were often envious of learning, blocking and severing the true Dao and extraordinary powers. Their disciples grew increasingly foolish and benighted, turning instead to superficial embellishments, causing rulers to be dazzled and confused. Their virtue and power were so shallow and meager that they were unworthy of being treated as fathers or even as friends, and so were treated as sons. Their wisdom was scant, and thus they could not plan for emperors and kings in matters of difficulty or ease. This provoked the great wrath of Heaven and Earth, giving rise to unceasing calamities and omens that could not be suppressed. The great fault lies here. Do you understand?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Very well. Now that you have awakened, I shall further clarify for you. Consider the Five Hegemons: their ministers entirely lacked true virtue and power, all capable of crafty deceit and cunning. The means by which they deceived one another were many—ministers often knew perverse, flattering, and deceptive arts, the methods by which they startled, moved, and confused their lords, sometimes even surpassing them. As a result, they rebelled in turn: sons killed their fathers, ministers killed their rulers, subordinates killed their superiors, all harboring the hearts of barbarians devoid of righteousness. Each person possessed crafty and deceptive techniques, each harbored treacherous intentions, and none held the true Dao. Thus, rebellions occurred repeatedly. Therefore, punishments were meted out with axes and drills, and ministers were regarded as entries in a death register.

Moreover, those ministers all harbored flattering embellishments and abundant cunning. Their Dao was not weighty enough to be revered, so they were regarded as livestock—this is the clear effect. Thus, the sages of antiquity, aligning with the will of Heaven, embraced the true Dao, esteemed virtuous and benevolent men, and banished the flattering and cunning, thereby fulfilling the heart of August Heaven. For this reason, our Dao fully opens the gates of fortune and shuts the doors of misfortune, never daring to allow cunning knowledge to surpass that of their lords. Do you now clearly understand?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Be cautious of this.”

The ministers of the highest antiquity were often immortal and long-lived, thus enabling their lords to enjoy longevity; the ministers of the middle antiquity were wise and embraced the Dao and virtue, thus enabling their lords to remain perpetually free from worry; the ministers of the lower antiquity, lacking the true Dao and being foolish, often rendered their lords exceedingly ignorant. When a lord is ignorant, his governance is perpetually chaotic and confused, failing to align with the will of Heaven. The ministers of hegemonic lords are all flatterers and deceivers, full of cunning and crafty deception, collectively deluding their lord, causing him to lose the correct path of Heaven and instead enter the gates of misfortune—thus becoming a great adversary of Heaven. Do you understand this?

For this reason, their governance is entirely inauspicious and cannot endure for long. A true person serving Heaven in affairs must be vigilant daily and must not indulge in reckless or baseless speech. Words should become standards; if speech does not become scripture, it is better to remain silent. If one’s words miss the mark, the sin is profound and ineradicable.

“Yes, yes.”

“Go now, for you have understood.”

**Divine Governance of Humanity’s Adherence to the Root: Secret Method of Hidden Protection, One Hundred Fifty-Six**

“Pray, I ask about a matter of great doubt.”
“Speak your words.”

**Rising:**
“Now the Heavenly Master broadly opens the path of the Dao of Heaven, gathering and collating the texts of ancient Daoist scriptures, taking them as the true essential and secret Way. The true Way is abundant in goodness; its writings enter into the spirit, thus enabling one to behold the divine and govern alongside the gods. If what is governed enters the spirit as the divine does, then it is the true Way. Yet it often comes to fruition in secluded chambers—some are enabled to transcend within the chamber and depart, some enter and exit but cannot leave, and some merely see the divine yet remain bound to this world without ever departing.

**Ceasing:**
Of those who transcend and depart, not one in ten thousand succeeds. Of those who attain great longevity, not one in a thousand succeeds. Of those who attain lesser longevity, not one in a hundred succeeds. Only those who fulfill their allotted years compare to these. Among all the people under Heaven who study and inquire, not one in ten thousand obtains a high office, not one in a thousand obtains a middling office, and not one in a hundred obtains a minor office. As for those who till the land to sustain life, not one in ten thousand gains a hundred million, not one in a thousand gains ten million, and not one in a hundred gains a million. All affairs are thus: their roots are many, but those who transcend the world or attain wealth and nobility are few. This foolish student is deeply troubled by this.

Now, in cultivating the Way, what should be the greatest precept to ensure lasting completion? In study and inquiry, what should be the greatest precept to attain high office? In managing life and amassing wealth, what should be the greatest precept to achieve prosperity? Today, I dare not but ask the Heavenly Master to resolve these doubts, for I fear that without enlightenment, I shall remain forever benighted, never attaining understanding.”

“Excellent, excellent! All true persons who question doubtful matters—Heaven has sent you to inquire. Very well. Sit calmly, listen well with your whole being, and I shall now fully expound the true Way to you, making all things clear so that you may follow and remember them with diligence.”

“Yes, yes.”

“Go forth. When later generations obtain my writings and thereby broadly open the path of the true Way, they will surely all study the true Way. The true Way frequently intersects with the divine; the Way of the gods is solely concerned with governing humanity. The gods delight in those who are kind to people and are startled by those who are not. They do not contend in speech beside people, appearing like flocks of birds coming and going without end. Some speak of people who are about to transcend and depart, some of those who will become wealthy and noble, some of those who will become poor and base. They praise some people and slander others, bringing great joy to some and constant bitter resentment to others.

The gods are beings without form, their transformations without limit. If one can focus the mind and guard the self, refusing to heed their words, examining the heart before acting, keeping the mouth closed to avoid transmitting their words, and not following their sorrows, angers, or joys—steadfastly holding to the root without wavering, devoted to secretly aiding and protecting people and all things, never wishing to harm—then after a year of understanding the Way, one will always act with supreme goodness, seeking benefit without harm, pursuing the Way and doing good until the end of one’s years without ceasing. For this, one must never grow lax. Though ten thousand may transcend, one may not; though ten thousand gain great fortune, one may meet misfortune. Acting thus, the host of gods will turn to aid and protect one, causing one to daily delight in goodness and no longer commit evil. Do you, true person, understand this?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Go forth. You have now understood. Those who practice the Way of the true person yet fall into disorder and ruin do so because their minds and intentions are not single and pure. They are easily pleased, easily angered, easily startled, easily confused, and prone to glib, clever speech, always desiring to speak of good and evil without restraint. When they encounter something they wish to say, they cannot restrain themselves. In such a state, the host of gods come together to deceive them. If they are petty men, they may ascend with demonic words and die, or frequently engage in contentious, reckless speech, or be startled by ghosts and spirits, thereby falling ill and descending into madness.

If one’s mind and intentions are not devoted to a single purpose, joy and anger are without constancy, and actions lose their correctness, one becomes distracted and without direction. One may thus lose worthy friends and good assistants, leading to peril and ruin. The great fault lies in not loving benefit: those above do not wish to benefit those below, heed false gods, and instead desire to harm. Thus, the worthy depart, and one loses their virtuous assistance. As for petty men, they do not wish to honor and respect their superiors but instead heed false gods, deception, demonic words, and reckless speech. This is why the Way is not accomplished—it is the gateway to misfortune. I cannot foresee and record all such outcomes.

In general, when people’s minds are not single, firm, and secret, they are easily swayed. Their actions are often inauspicious, their deeds frequently harmful, and they meet misfortune. Their faults and transgressions accumulate in great number and cannot all be spoken. I have merely outlined the great principles of the Way for the true person, revealing its beginnings, so that the wise and discerning may deeply examine my writings, carefully follow and observe them, and surely come to understand. Do you, true person, comprehend this?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Go forth. You have now greatly awakened. Hold fast to my writings as a profound precept, and those who practice them may avoid misfortune for ten thousand generations. Truly... Thus, when later generations read my writings from beginning to end and fully grasp their essential meaning to put them into practice, not one in ten thousand will fail. If one guards them without ceasing, success will naturally be complete. With a single-minded and good intention, one may join with the gods. With a perverse and evil intention, the Way will surely be lost.

If a great person does not listen carefully, they may lose their rightful position. If a petty person does not listen carefully, they may join with demons. All these bring harm to the self—one cannot but take great care and caution. When people act and err, they bring it upon themselves. Calamity and change arise from within the heart and mind, not from elsewhere.”

“Does the Perfected One know this?”
“Indeed, indeed.”
“How terrifying! How terrifying!”
“If you know fear and terror, then you may be said to have truly entered the Dao. The foolish student has now awakened greatly—let this be your model for conduct. In accomplishing affairs, you will long enter the Gate of Auspiciousness and avoid the Door of Misfortune. The paths of life and death may be clearly seen for all time. Follow this in practice, and misfortune will daily recede, while good fortune will come. Since you already know this, □□ I shall not admonish you further.”
“Indeed, indeed.”

〈Rising〉
“In conducting yourself as a disciple of the Dao, if you study and attain high office, be resolute in your intent. Generally, when people pursue learning, they enter the gate of study today, apply their minds with single-minded focus, constantly seeking to aid and benefit others with love and without deceit. From youth to old age, they study without ceasing until death, never content merely to obtain office. They simply delight in learning, striving to master the classics and the Dao, accumulating goodness without end. Their conduct and reputation are established, their mastery of the classics and the Dao is complete, and they deeply understand the origins of disasters and changes from ancient times to the present. Their conduct and learning benefit those above and bring advantage to those below. Their accumulated goodness cannot be concealed, and their reputation spreads far and wide. Enlightened rulers favor them, summoning and appointing them, while the common people all say, ‘Excellent!’ and ‘Most auspicious!’ This is the sort of person whose praises others speak with joy. Such a one is a good person who studies and transcends the world.”

〈End〉

“Does the Perfected One understand this?”
“Indeed, indeed.”

The One Hundred Fifty-Seventh Admonition on the Failures and Successes in the Dao

“Let me further expound the Dao to you. Those who fail to transcend the world, though they enter the gate of learning today, take no joy in seeking the true Dao or its virtuous teachings. Instead, they crave broad knowledge and extensive observation, believing these alone can lead them to the ultimate mastery of the sages. They do not delight in putting goodness into practice but prefer the superficial embellishments of rhetoric, which they use to deceive and feign. Even after gaining entry into the classics and the Dao, their minds remain scattered, their focus never unified. They indulge in reckless speech, honing their verbal dexterity to harm others, showing no reverence for their superiors and no kindness or care for their inferiors. Their conduct and their grasp of the classics and the Dao are hollow and empty. They are unfit to be worthy ministers to emperors and kings, and instead, they become mere functionaries and petty officials. Others may assist them with wealth and goods, seeking high office to build their reputation, but they then embezzle and plunder resources, advancing private interests at public expense, betraying those above and exploiting those below. Such men disrupt and corrupt proper governance, bringing harm to Heaven and Earth and becoming traitors to the state. They are wolves among the people, wicked sons to their parents. Heaven and Earth detest them, and the spirits loathe them. Thus, when their crimes are exposed, they are often punished by emperors and kings, aligning with the will of Heaven and removing a great harm from the people. These are the schemers who obtain office through deceit.

Some, though their minds are scattered and their hearts empty of true steadfastness, ceaselessly scheme to obtain office. Office, however, is the domain of Heaven’s stellar officials, bestowed upon those of virtue and rewarded to those of merit. It is not recklessly granted to those without merit. Those without merit are disregarded by Heaven and Earth and unloved by the divine spirits. Yet the foolish, unable to recognize their own faults, persist in their vain desire for heavenly office. Malevolent spirits and entities descend upon their hearts, driving them to reckless speech and leading them to utter perverse words they cannot restrain. Thus, some meet death through their own perverse speech—this is what it means. Not only in the pursuit of the Dao, but in failing to grasp its essence, there is peril. In all human conduct, if one does not delight in goodness, all will end in misfortune.

Perfected One, strive earnestly. You are fortunate to harbor good intentions, always seeking to act with kindness and benefit others—you have already transcended. Yet, whether the Perfected One or an ordinary person transcends or not does not lie in what comes before but in what follows. All failures stem from a lack of self-love, from carelessness, from declaring oneself already transcended, only to falter midway and fail to cross over. Thus, when I speak now and cannot stop midway, it is because the Perfected One compels me to continue. If I were to halt my words now, growing careless and silent, I would fear incurring the Perfected One’s resentment. If the Perfected One resents me, he would look up to Heaven, and Heaven would then bring harm upon me. Therefore, I dare not speak lightly, nor dare I close my learning and cease midway. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“This is how ordinary people bring harm upon themselves. They often fail when they do not understand, when their actions do not align with their roots, and thus they lose their way. You have already rendered great service to Heaven—strive earnestly, strive earnestly!”

“Indeed, indeed. I dare not grow careless in my studies or in ascending the Dao.”

“Go forth. You have already grasped the art of self-transcendence. I have nothing more to add. Let me now fully explain to the Perfected One: there are those who delight in managing their households and accumulating wealth, attaining riches and honor. In their youth, they are capable of labor and diligently apply themselves to their tasks. As they grow older, they continue to think and act with all their strength until they can no more. They promote goodness and conceal wrongdoing, always delighting in doing good, trembling with reverence for their superiors. In all matters of doubt, they exercise caution and restraint, daring not to act recklessly. They care for their inferiors and do not wish to harm others. They do not distort the king’s laws nor take pleasure in following corrupt customs or partaking in reckless feasting. They do not engage in matters that are not urgent. Those who possess wisdom and conduct themselves thus continue until old age without ceasing. Though their substance may seem empty, their words are never frivolous. Thus, they amass treasures and accumulate wealth, thereby becoming accomplished individuals.

People’s worthiness or unworthiness lies in the divergence of their intentions. There are those who are not good: they disrespect their superiors, harm their inferiors, delight in following corrupt customs, and frequently engage in non-essential and reckless behavior. They are glib-tongued, unable to restrain their reckless speech in the marketplace. Such people are doomed to misfortune, chaos, peril, and ruin—they do not walk the Dao. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Therefore, those who walk the Dao must concentrate their minds, seal their mouths, and refrain from reckless speech. Thus, the ancients—sages and worthies—observed the luminous laws of Heaven and were able to practice the Dao and uphold virtue. Heaven is singularly focused, moving day and night in the Dao without speech, and thus it alone attains auspiciousness. Earth moves day and night in the Dao without speech, nurturing and sustaining the myriad things, and thus it alone endures in tranquility. The four seasons move alone in the Dao, ceaselessly day and night, and thus they perpetually and singularly bring prosperity to kings. The Three Luminaries move alone in the true Dao without speech, and thus they remain eternally bright, following the revolutions of Heaven. The Five Phases move alone in the true Dao without speech, and thus they become constant with Heaven and Earth. All under Heaven who walk the Dao emulate these examples—there are too many to record. Therefore, if one cherishes and benefits from speech, refraining from reckless words, the Dao may be attained. Those who treat matters lightly and disregard my teachings will surely be harmed by the Dao—there is not a single exception.

Perfected One, you have come from afar to seek answers to your doubts, and thus I admonish you. Reflect upon and ponder these words. I have not failed you. I speak on behalf of Heaven to admonish the virtuous rulers. Heaven bestows upon virtuous rulers, and they must love the Dao. The people will then emulate their rulers, all taking this text as a great admonition. Thus, they may attain auspiciousness and distance themselves from misfortune. This text is meant to admonish the foolish below—guard it well and do not conceal it.”

“Indeed, indeed. Go forth. This admonition may seem small, yet it is vast; it may appear shallow, yet it is profound.”

“What does this mean?”

“Indeed, consider its words—they may seem small, yet their admonition is vast. Reflect upon them, and they may resemble the arguments of common sophists, appearing shallow and unworthy of transmission. Yet when one contemplates their warning to perfect humanity, they are profound.

Thus, when I compose the Dao for the Perfected One, its vastness penetrates to the boundless, its subtlety permeates to the innermost. In reverence, it reaches the highest; in humility, it extends to the lowest. Therefore, it encompasses divine beings above and servants below.

The reason for this is to ensure that whether great or small, wise or foolish, noble or common, all may find its words sufficient.”

“Why is this so? I wish to understand its meaning.”

“Excellent! Your question grasps its essence. Indeed, I compose this scripture for the rulers of Great Peace. When such rulers govern, they must take Heaven as their model, not merely presiding over a small domain confined to a single realm.

Thus, Heaven’s model is supreme without superior, humble without inferior, vast without limit, and subtle without core. It nurtures the myriad twelve thousand things—good and evil, great and small—all benefiting from its protection. It endows them with primordial qi to give life, and in the end, does not harm them. Therefore, it is called Heaven, most divine, the sovereign without peer.

Now, as the qi of the Supreme August arrives and virtuous rulers govern, they must take this as their model. Thus, my Dao ascends and descends, sinks and floats, so that all the worthy may examine it together.

Therefore, in the southeast lies the Earth’s Gate, where waters sustain the pillars of Heaven, not resisting even the smallest flow. All—good and evil, great and small—converge there. Does the Perfected One understand this?”

“Stop.”
“Yes, yes.”
“Go. I wished to continue expounding the boundless discourse, unfolding its grand patterns, but let us pause briefly, each returning to ponder it in our hearts. If one practices the Dao without grasping its meaning, it is like pointing south while asking about the north. With such a mindset, even after ages of study, nothing will be attained. I dare not proceed further—you have already understood.”
*Right: Collected Difficulties on the Dao’s Precepts, Governance, Life’s Success and Failure, and the Origins of Fortune and Misfortune*
*Verification of Longevity Texts, Scroll 158*

“May I ask one doubtful matter? Now, while I am able, I wish to inquire of the Heavenly Master about the texts’ essentials: is there a way for a person to live truly long, to share in affairs without ever growing weary? May I hear of this?”

“Indeed. Do you wish to examine the multitude of texts to discern where the worthy reside?”
“Yes.”
“Be seated, and I shall explain it to the Perfected One. To accumulate texts by the hundreds of millions cannot extend life—what benefit is there to destiny? To fill a chamber with writings yet fail to govern justly—what benefit is there to rule? To fill the court with ministers yet fail to bring the ruler great peace and joy—what benefit is there to the emperor? For one person to father a hundred children, leaving parents to hunger and cold—what benefit is there to kinship? To amass remedies by the cartload yet fail to prolong life—what benefit is there to human destiny? To endlessly expound on matters yet fail to remove the ruler’s disasters—what benefit is there to the court? Such examples are countless and cannot all be recorded. I merely raise the guiding threads for the Perfected One, that all the worthy may reflect deeply on them. Do you wish to know their effect?”

“Only the Heavenly Master may tell me.”
“Very well. Sit calmly and focus, and I shall explain it to you.
*Rise*
Among hundreds of millions of texts, only those that can lengthen life, benefit destiny, and secure the body are true texts—the rest are not. Among a chamber full of writings, only those that can win Heaven’s favor and govern justly are true texts—the rest are not. Among a court full of ministers, only those who can bring joy to their ruler and assist in achieving great peace are the emperor’s true ministers and good officials—the rest are merely functionaries. Of a hundred children born, only one who ensures parents constant joy and no hunger or cold is a worthy and filial child—the rest are mere numbers. Among cartloads of remedies, only those that can extend years are true remedies—the rest are not. Such comparisons in the world are too many to enumerate. The Perfected One must ponder their meaning deeply. My texts use one to infer ten thousand, sufficient to illuminate the Dao of the world. Thus, I instruct the Perfected One to entrust the Dao to rulers of supreme virtue, to scrutinize and verify all common texts and the words of mundane scholars, clearly demonstrating them to the worthy, so that all may awaken together from delusion and confusion. Once common texts are verified, disasters will depart day by day.

For perverse texts and perverse words are the masters of calamity. For upright texts and upright words are the officials that expel perverse and evil forces. When texts are upright and words are upright, perversity has no master and nowhere to abide. Perverse texts and words as masters of perversity are like thieves having a master’s house to lodge in. Once the master dies, thieves have no reason to return. Does the Perfected One also understand this?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Excellent.

The Dao of Heaven, as a model, uses the One to encompass the myriad—yet it cannot be exhaustively recorded in writing. Here ends the discourse.

Perfected One, having received this, you must deeply ponder its essential meaning. With a worthy and enlightened mind possessing nine apertures, understanding comes readily; upon seeing the text, great awakening arises spontaneously—no further questions are needed.

The written word, when excessive, only plunges people into darkness. It is better to lift up its single guiding principle, so that the ten thousand strands arrange and unfold themselves. Thus, the teeming masses, though numerous, are not equal to one sagely ruler. The countless stars, though innumerable, are not equal to the brightness of a single sun. The clamorous words of the crawling multitudes beneath heaven are not equal to one worthy minister in a kingdom. The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless, without limit—yet it is not equal to the single primordial qi that upholds the mandate of Heaven as its guiding thread.

Worthy rulers of supreme virtue, deeply reflect upon my words, and longevity will naturally extend. If later generations collectively ponder my words, fathers will be kind and sons filial, their virtue daily expanding and brightening. Mothers will be loving and wives obedient, and the entire realm will become worthy and good by dawn. Great and small will vie in doing good, and the later generations will know no coercion. They will no longer recognize perverse texts, nor will flatterers find refuge in them. Disasters and omens will be entirely dispelled, and the Three Luminaries will shine brightly.

This is the art of spontaneity, uniformly practiced by the celestial spirits. Is this not the Way? What sorrow could remain in such great joy? To take this as a model is to follow the course of Heaven. Who records it? It is the numinous work of Heaven and Earth. The texts of verification resonate in harmony with Heaven and Earth—this is the Heaven-ordained tally of trust.

Sagely rulers and worthies should together examine these words. Those who practice them will daily prosper, aligning with the times as if by appointment, fulfilling the desires of Heaven and Earth—hence, auspicious indeed!

Here ends the discourse.

When yin and yang flow in harmony, winds and rains come in season, and the ten thousand transformations vanish. By the texts of verification, I do not praise myself. I truly know this—not merely embellished speech—so act swiftly upon it.

Perfected One, do you understand?”

“Yes, yes.”
“Go forth, go forth. Refine it in detail, and the Dao will come of itself.”
“Yes, yes.”

**Method One Hundred Fifty-Nine: The Secret of Male and Female Reversing Forms**

“I humbly request to ask one more doubtful matter. In the text Your Heavenly Master previously bestowed upon this foolish student, there is mention of *male and female reversing forms*—I wish to hear its meaning.”
“Ah! The text has already explained it sufficiently for one to see—why do you ask again?”
“My mind is dull and blocked, difficult to enlighten. I can only rely on Your Heavenly Master’s secret instruction.”
“Very well, sit calmly, and I shall now explain it to you.

The nature of Heaven and Earth is such that yang delights in yin, and yin delights in yang. Thus, yang ought to transform into yin, and yin ought to transform into yang. In all matters of the Dao of yin and yang, it is ever thus. They mutually delight in one another, and so their refinement and cultivation proceed swiftly each day. However, this must be □□ with graded instructions—it cannot be directly taught to others, lest they fall into heterodoxy. Now, listen carefully.”

“Yang transforms its form to become yin’s form, and yin transforms its form to become yang’s form—this is precisely using one’s own body to assume the other’s appearance. It cannot be directly attained, lest one fall into heterodoxy.”

“Indeed, indeed. Yet I remain half-enlightened and still in doubt.”

“Ah! Why do you find this so difficult to grasp? Simply use your own body as the form: yang becomes like the body of a yin person, and yin becomes like the body of a yang person.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“You have now understood. Go and practice, and the matter will become clear.”

*Here ends the collection of abstruse texts and essential formulas, recording the successes and failures of the worthy in achieving the Dao through the reversal of yin and yang forms, embracing Heaven and enfolding Earth, and preserving qi without cessation—Formula One Hundred Sixty.*

“I wish to ask Heavenly Master one more matter before I cease.”

“Speak. What doubt remains?”

“As the Dao embraces Heaven and enfolds Earth, who sustains its qi and seasons?”

“Profound! Far-reaching! Subtle! This is indeed the question you ask. What have you observed to prompt this inquiry?”

“I have observed and witnessed the Way of Heaven and Earth, yet I do not understand its ultimate limit—thus I find it strange and ask.”

“Excellent! Your words penetrate to the subtlest meaning. The reason the Way of Heaven and Earth endures long and forever is that it preserves qi without cessation. Thus, Heaven relies solely on qi to determine fortune and misfortune, and all things take it as their model. Without qi, they perish utterly. If you wish to avoid ultimate exhaustion, you should unite with qi as the Mysterious Female, modeling yourself on Heaven—how then could you die? Yet this cannot be swiftly attained; it is achieved only in the secluded chamber. Entering the chamber to contemplate the Dao, you naturally cease eating and unite with qi. Thus, you become one with the numinous spirits of Heaven and Earth, no longer subject to the governance of the vulgar world. You ascend to follow the Great One of Heaven, pay homage at the Central Ultimate, receive the talisman, and circulate freely through the six directions and eight distances—endlessly. Contemplate the words of this text, and you will attain it yourself; the steps to becoming a spirit will be visible. Departing the world to govern in the heavens above, you will no longer be seen. If you wish to further witness its clear proof: the world cannot long endure while one alone governs. Thus, those who attain the Dao ascend to Heaven, which is also their departure from the world. Those who are unwilling to exert themselves for the Dao descend into the earth upon death, unable to long abide in this middle realm. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, those who depart to avoid the world—though their sacred texts and constant standards remain—are no longer seen. This is the clear proof. Those who do not die and attain the Dao ascend to Heaven; those who die descend into the earth, unable to long remain on the harmonious path of the middle. If you grasp my text, ponder its meaning deeply. If you delight in ascending and wish to live forever, joining your strength with Heaven and partaking in the seasonal sacrifices and feasts of the world below, strive for the true Dao—this is its purest method. If you do not delight in eternal life but delight in death, abandon the Dao and follow the vulgar—you too will return to the earth below, no longer able to long behold the sun, moon, stars, and celestial reckoning. My text is □□—ten thousand times ten thousand, not a single word is lost. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity have all departed, and none are seen today—this is its great proof. Ponder it yourself: if you delight in ascending, you will ascend; if you delight in descending, you will descend. None can wrest your will from you.

Therefore, I, as the Virtuous Lord of Great Peace, have established laws and institutions without limiting them to one person. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, if even a single person remains aggrieved and unfulfilled in their desires, then the balanced qi of the Supreme August cannot fully descend. Thus, Heaven has instructed me to broadly open the path, allowing each to freely choose what they may do. The wise and enlightened who delight in life may study my text, contemplate its meaning, enter the chamber to accomplish the Dao, and attain life. The gentle and yielding who delight in assisting emperors and kings in governance may model themselves on my text to bring about Great Peace. Those who delight in managing their households, nurturing life, and accumulating wealth may contemplate my text and complete their allotted years before dying. Thus, each attains their heart’s desire, and none remains aggrieved. Therefore, the qi of Great Peace is able to arrive. ‘Peace’ means level and free from grievance—hence it is called ‘peace.’ Thus, when the Virtuous Lord governs, the qi of Great Peace arises. The reason is that the world harbors no grievances, and each attains what they delight in—this is why the Perfected One is commanded to entrust it to a ruler of supreme virtue. A ruler of supreme virtue must be benevolent, worthy, and enlightened. The enlightened do not wrest away what others desire; they necessarily win the hearts of the world, wishing to align with Heaven’s will and return to the Dao. Do you, Perfected One, understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

"On the Appointment of Officials: The Key to Success or Failure, One Hundred and Sixty-First"

“Perfected One, I shall now earnestly caution you with these words, that your conduct may resemble the Way of Heaven.

The Way of Heaven does not wrest away what others desire to do;
The Way of Earth likewise does not wrest away what others desire to do;
The conduct of an enlightened ruler delights in emulating Heaven and Earth, never wresting away what others do.

Thus resembling Heaven and Earth, he alone may be called their equal and win their hearts. Do you understand?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“When Heaven is about to turn malign and the year portends great calamity, it invariably harms what people strive to do—thus the people reap nothing, and the year brings famine and cold. When Earth is about to turn malign, it injures what nourishes people, roots fail to take firm hold, and sickness spreads—thus the year yields no harvest, and the people suffer hardship and poverty.

When a declining and malevolent ruler courts disaster, he appoints officials without regard for their fitness for office. This is called deliberately disrupting the celestial bureaucracy, violating Heaven’s prohibitions, and forsaking Heaven’s principles. He reverses the proper order, meting out blame and punishment without considering whether the task exceeds their strength or lies beyond human capacity.

It is like ordering a lord to walk a hundred *li* in a single day—one fears he may not reach his destination and halt along the way. What lies beyond human capacity is precisely this.

Thus, if one does not carefully select people but recklessly assigns them to office, this is called afflicting the people and endangering the state—it is called disordering governance and ruining administration.

Heaven and Earth are supremely numinous and enlightened, yet they dare not wrest away what others desire to do. To do so would bring a year of great calamity—how much more so for man?

Perfected One, do you now comprehend and awaken?”

“Indeed, indeed. If one could follow the customs of each state and bestow upon them the Master’s text, thereby instructing and enlightening them—”

“Excellent. You may be called one who understands affairs, for Heaven does not wrest away what people desire.”

“You walk the upright Way and naturally receive Heaven’s mandate, your years and days ever increasing—how could they ever reach an end? You study not for worldly honor or glory, so why seek further? Have you not already attained Heaven’s will and prolonged your years?

Now that I have told you this, can you still say no?”

“Indeed. I receive this great favor with joy and have no further regrets. Yet I fear my strength may falter in propagating the Master’s teachings, for I cannot disseminate them all at once.”

“Why must it be all at once? Simply persist without ceasing, and like a boat carried by the current, it will not be long before you reach your destination.”

“Indeed, indeed. I accept this solemn charge and dare not deviate even by a hair’s breadth.”

“You have already grasped its meaning; I need not admonish you further. Go now, our brief discourse is complete, and the matter is settled. Should you have doubts another day, return again.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

Inscribed on the Eastern Wall

The ancient divine beings admonished their disciples and later learners to create images of good deeds, secretly aiding and benefiting others to ensure constant auspiciousness, for their merit would be doubled.

Overt goodness is met with human chatter and dissolution. Covert goodness, however, is known to Heaven, Earth, and all spirits—thus its merit is doubled.

Those who accumulate virtue are cherished by the wealthy, and their goodness comes as naturally as the sun’s rise. What people praise, ghosts and spirits also praise, thereby aiding and protecting them.

Those who embrace the Dao attain longevity, aligning their concerns with yin and yang, following the movements of the August Spirit, and harmonizing with the nature of Heaven and Earth. By grasping its principles, Heaven protects them; those who lose it fall into chaos, and Heaven does not protect them.

Seeking goodness through goodness—nothing in this is strange.

To attain it through benevolence is the beginning of the Dao;
To attain it through virtue is the harmony of the Dao;
To attain it through the Dao is the highest of the Dao.

Alas! Be cautious, be cautious—act without recklessness. Ponder deeply on this text and transmit it to later generations, that no harm may come.

To follow the turning of the four seasons is the highest of the Dao.

Goodness arises of itself; evil brings illness upon itself. Matters of fortune and misfortune all emerge from within, calling to their kind without losing their essence.

The Dao of Heaven is impartial, responding only to what one cultivates.

Thus, those who came before had disciples, and those who follow are enveloped in virtuous qi. Pursuing learning without cease ensures that one’s fate attains yang fulfillment. Some gain longevity and an unblemished body—this is the fruit of goodness.

Within and without, spirits turn to remove their harm. The disciple stands before them, and the master faces them in response.

All things have their nature; the affairs of the world each follow their kind.

*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll 101*

**West Wall Diagram 164**

Depicting the admonitions of divine persons and perfected ones from the High Antiquity to later learners—an illustration of those who commit evil, act as yin traitors, disdain compliance, and instead delight in harm and jealousy, bringing death and misfortune upon others.

The Dao of Heaven cannot be forcibly seized; those who seize it will inevitably meet death by arms, forfeiture of authority, the ruin of the world, and the destruction of the Way. Sacred texts will be lost, and what was sought as gain will turn to harm—this is the resonant response of Heaven and Earth’s nature.

Thus arises the juncture of the spontaneous. Examine joy to ensure enduring existence—be cautious, be ever cautious.

Do no harm, do no good: goodness arises of itself, and evil collapses of itself. Contemplate these two images and ponder their benefits and harms.

All matters under Heaven follow their kind; even in the space of a hair’s breadth, there is no deviation. Yet people fail to refine themselves, remaining ignorant of their own faults. Once the name of guilt is attached, nothing can be done. Failing to preserve one’s root, death comes with excess transgression.

Evil committed within summons perverse qi from without. Thus, ahead lies the harm of imprisonment, and behind lurk malevolent ghosts—all hastening to battle, unable to cease, leading to the destruction of the self.

Therefore, this illustration is made to instruct later generations. The wise and enlightened receive it as a great warning. The foolish, distrusting the Dao, remain heedless of affairs. The text is precise in its words, not erring by even a fraction.

Thus, those who embrace softness attain longevity, while those who delight in strife ensure their own demise. Matters each follow their kind, never to return. Though one may repent, it is of no avail—the ghosts have already attached themselves.

Heed the warning and awaken, returning in time. If no harm has yet been done, one may still become a person of goodness.

Goodness ascends, while evil descends. The Dao of Heaven is impartial, operating through spontaneity, and thus does not lose its *zhi* (cessation) of law—its workings are like those of spirits.

---

"〈From the beginning〉, I studied in my youth without ceasing, my spirit ever fixed upon it, tears often welling up. Through long accumulation, by the great grace of August Heaven, I was fortunate today to encounter the Heavenly Master in the wilderness.

At first, my learning was deficient, and my inquiries concerned only superficial matters. Originally, I sought the three hundred methods of *guarding the One* and *nurturing nature*, yet when I beheld the Heavenly Master expounding without limit, I dared ask: *Can the body attain peace and long endure?*

〈Ceasing〉, I did not yet see the Heavenly Master expound without limit, so I dared inquire about minor governance. Once I witnessed the Master’s boundless discourse, I then ventured to ask in full about the affairs since the opening of Heaven and Earth—how emperors and kings have succeeded one another, bearing sorrows and hardships, and how celestial disasters and strange omens have never ceased. By what means may these be eliminated?

Moreover, the host of spirits, without cause, jointly harm humanity, preventing people from fulfilling their allotted years. How may this be halted?

Now, having received the Heavenly Master’s stern teachings and profound warnings, at what time should this scripture—*which halts deceit and revives the Dao of Heaven and Earth*—be revealed?"

"It shall be issued on a *yisi* day, entrusted to couriers for transmission. Thereafter, in each year, it shall emerge during the *xuanjia*—the first and supreme decade of Heaven’s celestial stems, coinciding with the inception of *primordial qi*. The text, both front and back, shall be delivered to the state, thereby resolving the successive calamities borne since the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

When delivering it, what characters should be used? The teachings accumulate through its script, yet only the deeply perceptive shall comprehend it. Do not allow the leakage of the *supreme harmony of August Heaven* or the *foremost Dao*. It shall be transmitted to those capable of conveying it, who together shall discern and resolve its meaning.

When the time of *xuanjia* arrives, should one appear confused or seek this scripture, present to them first the *superficial methods of guarding the One*."

"It has been entrusted to courier *fangshi*, to be delivered to a ruler of utmost virtue. What does this mean?"

"One who obtains it and guards it in practice is the rightful recipient; one who does not practice it is not. True persons must not release it prematurely. Moreover, Heaven’s wrath may turn and slay. My warnings are fully expounded herein. □□, for I truly fear Heaven’s decree."

"Now, the Heavenly Master’s teachings and commands descend to this foolish disciple. My heart is heavy, as if I might yet understand, and I dare not betray them. I earnestly ask: *For those who depict the diagrams, how should the divine robes be illustrated?*"

"All must emulate the laws of Heaven, not follow worldly customs. Those who do not comprehend Heaven’s laws depict the figures’ sizes and robes according to their own whims.

Robes follow the colors of the *Five Phases*. Now, let the mother contain the child within, arranging them by color in sequence. The *great layered robe* has five layers; the *middle layered robe*, four; the *lesser layered robe*, three; the *subtle layered robe*, symbolizing *yin-yang*, has two. The *grand assembled robe* is a chaotic blend of six layers.

I wish to hear: *What does the great layering symbolize?* It symbolizes the *qi* of the *Five Phases* uniting. *What do the four layers symbolize?* They symbolize the *Four Seasons* turning and generating one another. *What do the three layers symbolize?* They symbolize the harmony of *father, mother, and child* in *yin-yang* union. *What do the two layers symbolize?* They symbolize the *king* and *minister qi* reaching one another. *What do the six layers symbolize?* They symbolize the chaotic mingling of colors from the *Six Directions*. Thus, the world possesses variegated hues. This is the meaning."

"Excellent! Excellent indeed!"

"Go now, and guard these secret texts with care."

"Yes, yes."

"Now, though this disciple is foolish and lowly, by your grace I have long been entrusted with the Master’s texts and their daily use, and all matters have been clear and complete. Yet I still wish to ask one doubt."

"What is your question?"

"Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the texts that have emerged are not few—indeed, they have accumulated in great number, many times over, and the River Chart and Luo Writing have brought them forth. Why then does this text not require the River Chart and Luo Writing to emerge?"

"Excellent! Excellent indeed! Your question is keen. Heaven has prompted your words—you have grasped its meaning. Now, Heaven has commanded me to fully reveal to emperors, kings, and the people the responsibility of *cheng-fu* (inherited burdens and blessings). The texts have accumulated in such multitude that they cannot all emerge through the River Chart and Luo Writing. The writings of the River Chart and Luo are vast and must be seen, yet their bamboo slips are too numerous to be fully known. Thus, Heaven has caused them to emerge through people. Heaven, knowing me deeply, has entrusted me with these words. Knowing the difficulty of your questions, it has instead sent you to transmit their essential teachings with me. You have studied diligently—how could you not yet understand the heart of the Dao? For what purpose has a *zhenren* (Perfected One) come?"

"Now, my ignorance and blindness prevent me from knowing myself."

"On the right, the inquiry concerns the closure of storage and the revelation of its diagrams, garments, and texts—on the transmission of rank and scriptures, and the maladies that arise when these are severed. Formula One Hundred Sixty-Six.
**〈Beginning〉**
'You have come from Heaven to study and question doubts; I have been entrusted by Heaven to instruct you.'
'I wish to hear the essential meaning of this formula—by what means is it illuminated? And how is it further clarified?'
'Now, a virtuous ruler who obtains my writings, comprehends them in heart, and practices them—discussing them with many worthies to transform the common people—will necessarily resonate in response with Heaven. This is its clear proof. My Dao is perfected through admonition, not through deceptive words or conduct. This is the formula.'
**〈End〉**
'Indeed, indeed. Your disciple is unworthy and has often troubled the Heavenly Master in vain.'
'If you do not ask questions, there is no way to know these things.'
**〈Beginning〉**
I have long held this learning within me, yet there has been no one with whom to speak, and thus I have not been able to transmit it in due time. Now, if people cannot distinguish black from white, the fault lies with me. Today, having received the transmission and the Perfected One’s questions, I am truly overjoyed. It is no different from ascending a terrace in spring and emerging to see the boundless sky—how could it be otherwise? Heaven’s grievances and knots have given rise to severe illnesses and unceasing transformations. This pent-up stagnation, now released through speech with you, brings joy. Why does the Heavenly Master not go forth to them himself? It is because the ranks and positions do not permit it. My office and duty reside in Heaven; the Perfected One’s office and duty reside on Earth. Earth brings forth the myriad things. Thus, what Heaven generates, Earth nurtures. Therefore, I transmit the Dao to the Perfected One. Earth gives birth to rulers, common people, and the twelve thousand things, all of which receive yang’s bestowal, emerging from within yin. Thus, you may transmit it to humanity.'
**〈End〉**
'Excellent! Excellent! This foolish student is greatly astonished.'"

"Rightly have you received this. Had you not earnestly questioned the Heavenly Master, there would have been no way to know it—you merely guessed and doubted, yet dared to ask so boldly."

"Excellent! This marks you as a student who comprehends matters, and this is not by your effort alone. Truly, Heaven has bestowed upon you this heart, enabling your words. Now, though you were once obscured and unaware of your own conduct, you are now made profoundly self-aware, illuminated as by the light of sun and moon. Yet you still doubt the sincerity of my words.

Though Heaven may wish to reveal something, it does not speak to humanity, making its intent difficult to discern. My writings carry Heaven’s commands, as clear as cinnabar and indigo. Should you disbelieve and privately conceal or suppress my texts, refusing to release them in due time, Heaven will afflict you with misfortune. If you persist in obstructing them, your fate will be dire indeed. It is Heaven that sent you to seek clarification and proof, and that compels the Perfected One to bring forth these teachings as clear and trustworthy evidence. Excellent! Excellent! Perfected One, take heed and be cautious."

"Indeed, indeed. Now, the Heavenly Master’s office is in Heaven, and you act out of necessity. I venture to pose one further doubt."

"Do you hesitate to speak?"

"Very well. In all matters of Heaven, are all things done by Heaven’s envoys, with transmissions given? Or is it only the Heavenly Master and this foolish student?"

"Alas! You grow more foolish—how can you not know that all things under Heaven are Heaven’s envoys? Each has its appointed duty, together fulfilling the Dao of Heaven. If even one thing is lacking, the Dao of Heaven is incomplete. Why do you remain ignorant of this? How profound is your blindness!"

"This ignorant one has not yet fully grasped it; may the Heavenly Master’s explanation bring clarity."

"Go, you have been sufficiently instructed."

Go, then, and strive with all your might. Every person has their appointed duty, and thus each becomes a vessel of Heaven’s envoys—how could one dare to labor alone by one’s own nature?"

"By no means, by no means. I shall go now."

**Scriptural Section 167: The Essential Formula for Heaven’s Numbers**

**〈Opening〉**
At the origin of Heaven’s numbers, when Heaven and Earth were yet undivided, the accumulated *qi* coalesced as one. Then it split into two, forming husband and wife. Heaven bestowed upon Earth, conceiving in the Dark Obscurity, and it was named *jiazi*. Its roots spread to the northeast, in *chou* and *yin*. First appearing in *mao*, it fully flourished in the southeast, in *chen* and *si*. Its branches hung in the south, nurtured at *wu*. Turning old in the southwest, in *wei* and *shen*, it matured in the west, where the sun set at *you*. Finally, it concealed itself in the northwest, in *xu* and *hai*. Thus, the numbering begins at one and ends at ten. Ten is the origin of the ten stems and the root of the Five Phases. When the number multiplies tenfold, it reaches one hundred and is complete. Therefore, Heaven’s inner cycle of one hundred days reaches its end. Thus, the Dipper establishes at *chen* and breaks at *xu*. "Establishes" means to stand—hence all things strive to reach full growth. "Breaks" means to decay—hence all things perish at *xu*. The numbers extend through the eight directions of Heaven and Earth, completing at ten. Yin and Yang establish and break, cycling endlessly in accord with the Dipper’s pointer, by which affairs are made clear. My writings serve to dispel harmful *qi*, modeling Heaven as their law.

**〈Closing〉**

**Right: Inquiry of the Heavenly Master—Verified and Illuminating Formula**

**[Preserved]**
Heaven bestows human destiny according to fixed patterns. What Heaven and Earth reserve for themselves is thirty years—akin to the intercalary months added when Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon align. Thus, this is the private destiny; those who exceed it are destined to become immortals.

Heaven’s destiny: the upper lifespan is set at one hundred twenty years; Earth’s lifespan at one hundred years; the human lifespan at eighty years; the hegemonic lifespan at sixty years; and the lesser lifespan at fifty years. Those who fall short of these measures have no fixed count in life and death, for they all suffer the calamities of inherited burdens.

Why, then, do they complain of injustice? Each person’s life is allotted a Heavenly reckoning by constant law, yet most fail to exhaust their allotted span. Heaven’s reckoning is boundless, so those who do good receive additional years—these are the surplus years added to them.

To know the great effect, consider this: in a village of ten households, each with a thousand acres of land, if nine households do evil and perish, leaving only one household to do good, it will inherit the fields of the nine. This is the principle. Do not expect Yin and Yang to protect people. If one fails to fulfill their allotted span yet hopes for Heaven’s reward, they will not receive it.

If today you feed someone, and tomorrow they feed you in return, it is not called "feeding others" but "lodging provisions." If today you give someone drink, and tomorrow they give you drink in return, it is not called "giving drink" but "lodging refreshment." If today you carry a burden for someone, and tomorrow they carry one for you, it is not called "bearing another’s load" but "lodging cargo." If today you lend someone strength, and tomorrow they repay it, it is not called "aiding others" but "exchanging merit." If today you praise someone, and tomorrow they praise you in return, it is not called "praising others" but "taking turns in commendation." Countless such examples exist, and none receive Heaven’s reward.

Yet if others do not protect me, and I alone secretly protect them, Heaven rewards me. If others speak ill of me, and I alone do good, Heaven rewards me. If others do not aid me, and I alone gladly aid them, Heaven rewards me. If others do not feed or give me drink, and I alone gladly feed and give them drink, Heaven rewards me. If others teach deceitful and hypocritical ways to exploit one another, and I alone teach others to do good with utmost sincerity, Heaven rewards me. If others claim Heaven and Earth are unknowing, and I alone secretly revere and serve them, Heaven rewards me. If others secretly plot to deceive their rulers, and I alone secretly protect and benefit them without daring to deceive, Heaven rewards me. If my parents do not love me, and I alone love and protect them, Heaven rewards me. Countless such examples exist.

Let the Perfected One reflect on this.

The superior person seeks Heaven’s reward; the middling person seeks human reward; the foolish do not give yet demand reward. The supremely good receive Heaven’s reward and transcend; the moderately good receive human reward, so they are loved, benefited, and served. The foolish, who do no good yet demand reward, are despised and punished by Heaven, Earth, and humanity.

Thus, in the Highest Antiquity, the *qi* of August Heaven descended in full to give life, the *qi* of the Earth Spirit ascended in full to nurture, the *qi* of the Five Phases joined forces, and the *qi* of the four seasons harmonized. The Three Luminaries shone in turn, and all under Heaven united as one in heart. The nature of Heaven is the highest conduct—honor it, esteem it, love it, and protect it. Since Heaven’s nature is good, it gives birth to all things without exception. Earth’s nature is good, nurturing all things without exception. The sage delights in ordering Heaven and Earth, and all things receive his merit. The great good, divine immortals, and perfected beings assist Heaven and Earth in their work, never daring to act contrary to their own suffering. They harmonize with the primordial *qi* and align with Heaven’s heart, thus enjoying enduring fortune and no misfortune.

The sages and worthies of old pondered deeply and planned far ahead, thereby understanding Heaven’s Dao and intent. They devoted themselves to secretly doing good and dared not do evil. They clearly saw August Heaven’s bright prohibitions, yet those below turned their backs and transgressed them. With shallow learning and weak faith, they disbelieved Heaven’s prohibitions—thus, they were difficult to transform, lost their way, and perished early.

I wish to hear of Heaven’s lifespan of one hundred twenty years, Earth’s lifespan of one hundred years, the human lifespan of eighty years, the hegemonic lifespan of sixty years, and the lesser lifespan of fifty years. The Three Norms begin in the east, the head of Heaven. The year and month reach their limit in the northeast, the pole of Heaven. As for Heaven’s lifespan, it is the firmness of numbers.

The northeast is the beginning of all things. The great reckoning of the year concludes here, thus one hundred twenty serves as the image of Heaven. Earth is yin, ever receiving bounty, and the northwest is the extreme of yin. Yin brings death while yang gives life—hence *hai* (亥) is the kernel, the end of yin at the northwest corner. The northwest governs Earth’s fate, so Earth’s lifespan reaches one hundred years. Eighty and sixty mark the cessation of yang and the rise of yin, coinciding with the onset of autumn. Autumn is the season when the white qi and the White Tiger hold sway, hence the hegemonic lifespan. Fifty signifies yang qi flourishing above while yin qi stirs below, yin contending with yang’s transformation—thus the lesser lifespan. Beyond this, all are called lives without constancy. How grievous the knotting of grievances!

Now I shall enlighten you with one solution, by which you may nurture yourself to the utmost through all ages—do not forget it. Those who wish to avoid misfortune and distance themselves from harm, to attain long life, must truly know how to cherish, love, and befriend themselves. By thus nurturing themselves, they may remain free from calamity. To preserve the body for long, regulate food and drink in due measure—neither too much nor too little—this is self-love and self-nurturance. To shut the gates and dwell within, avoiding worldly affairs, is self-love and self-nurturance. To read without limit, content in poverty and humble station, free from care—this too is self-love and self-nurturance. Yet all that came before was not so.

To speak of self-love is to speak of sincerity. Sincerely cherish and protect yourself, ever mindful that the body is incomplete; even with eyes closed, you still perceive its incompleteness, never apart from it for a moment. Reflecting thus, you grow anxious, until you feel sated without eating—such is the person of self-love. To speak of self-regard is to speak of cherishing the body’s form, its every aspect visible and pondered. Truly loving and cherishing without cease, the countenance radiates light. Day and night, it cannot be forgotten, becoming a constant practice. Thereby the flesh becomes buoyant and strength increases—this is the Dao of self-regard and self-love.

Now I cause men and women, young and old, worthy and unworthy, to gather and submit memorials, that the emperor may be enlightened and perceptive. The emperor is like the Pole Star, silently abiding in its place while all stars come to present their affairs. The greater ones stand before, the middling in the middle, the lesser behind. If even one star fails to appear, the qi is cut off, and Heaven’s movements are harmed. For the stars are the essence and radiance of the people and all things. Thus, if one person cannot reach the emperor, one star likewise cannot reach him. Thereupon Heaven’s qi becomes disordered, and Earth’s qi turns contrary. Therefore, instruct all officials and commoners, great and small, to submit memorials together, to unblock Heaven’s qi, to stabilize the stellar reckoning, to dispel Heaven’s ailments, and to resolve the emperor’s burden of inherited transgressions.

Thus, I issue decrees through three channels to ensure no obstruction: senior officials record calamities and omens within cities and walls; road administrators record those along thoroughfares; and those in the four wilds record those in the countryside. Each takes note of the long and short, passing word to one another, and together they vie to submit their reports. Senior officials must memorialize; townsfolk must memorialize; travelers must memorialize. If senior officials do not submit, they fear the people will; if the people do not, they fear travelers will; if travelers do not, they fear officials will. Thus, all are made to sit together, and only then do they compete to present matters.

When officials and people are trustworthy, the emperor employs them without betrayal, so they delight in their service. The emperor gains wisdom and is called a ruler after his own heart, thereby securing long peace for himself. Officials and people honor Heaven and Earth and remain free from illness. Heaven, Earth, and the four directions all benefit, ensuring enduring fortune and serving as a model for ten thousand generations. This is entrusted to a ruler of supreme virtue, that the people may know Heaven’s intent, enabling them to secure and preserve themselves, free from confusion.

Great assemblies are convened to rectify affairs, to examine the roots of Heaven and Earth, to eliminate the terrors of Heaven, the faults of Earth, and the harms to the state, and to establish the *Dongji Jing*. Here is depicted a divine person in feathered robes, ascending to Heaven in a nine-dragon chariot, accompanied by lesser immortals on simurghs and cranes, with colored clouds billowing ahead, as if bidding farewell. Let all be open and unobstructed, to accord with the hearts of Heaven and Earth, to turn back Heaven and Earth’s disasters, to smooth the discourse of Heaven and Earth, and to let the people dwell securely in their places, with all things unharmed.

Thus, Heaven issues written decrees, enabling messengers to traverse ten thousand leagues, conveying their words to gladden the virtuous, to recognize the wicked, and to untangle grievances. Thereby the emperor, dwelling within a hundred layers, attains long security, his wisdom reaching distant lands. Since the Highest and Middle Antiquity, many have turned their backs on Heaven and Earth, deceiving their superiors. Thus, disasters and calamities have daily increased, and the dead cannot be numbered. The emperor has long been distressed, unable to restrain his subordinates from deceit and falsehood, so Heaven has sent forth texts through three channels to unblock the qi, to delight in knowing gains and losses, to harmonize above and below, and to extend remonstrance to the humble in distant lands, that no grievances remain, to accord with August Heaven’s heart, to rejoice in the removal of disasters, and to prevent Heaven’s wrath.

In the Latter Age, human hearts are perverse and obscured, unlike the Three Sovereigns of Highest Antiquity, whose hearts were simple and sincere, their intentions single-minded. Each delighted in according with Heaven’s heart, loyal and trustworthy, never deceiving their superiors—thus no texts were needed. In the Latter Age, petty men are foolish and deluded, distorting words and fabricating falsehoods, deceiving Heaven and Earth, and hoodwinking the emperor. Thus, Heaven and Earth are constantly enraged and send down calamities. When Heaven and Earth’s ailments are dispelled, the emperor is secure and long-lived, the people are at peace in their places, all things fulfill their Heaven-appointed years, no resentments remain, yin and yang proceed in harmony, and the host of spirits rejoice greatly—this is the essential Dao.

〈Beginning〉 The Chart of the Dao of Spontaneity Completed as Admonition 〈End〉 Scroll 168

〈Beginning〉 On Emptiness: Emptiness is inwardly replete yet outwardly empty, as if something were not. Reverse the womb and embryo to dwell with the Dao; preserve the heart alone, suspending the dragon’s thoughts; thus becomes the chamber of spirit, gathering the Dao in emptiness. Roam only with qi, hence emptiness; in qi and spirit, all else is cast aside. The heart as master ensures no deviation; examine its intent closely, never forget the true scripture. Attain this and transcend, roaming long; why not hasten to refine, instead joining the foolish? Once misfortune arrives, great calamity befalls; abandon true simplicity, and revert to dust and ash. The worthy see the scripture and take heed 〈End〉 Admonition on the Chamber of Emptiness.

〈Beginning〉 On Non-Action: Non-action is action without contrivance, thus linked to the Dao. It emerges before infancy, enters the unbroken. Reaching the Great Beginning, one returns; at heaven and earth’s inception, the source of yin and yang. Entering the art of non-action, the body may be preserved; abandoning root for branch is the Dao’s affliction. Departing the Great Beginning, preservation becomes difficult; straying far from life, one nears death’s gate. Fondness for worldly affairs harms the soul and spirit; holding to two and forgetting one loses their counterpart. Can one not take heed? This is the origin of the Dao. You, guard the One—source of benevolence and worth. Heaven’s Dao follows the One, hence completeness; earth’s Dao follows two, nearing ghosts and spirits. Discern non-action, and the Dao’s spirit is supreme. Reflect deeply on this, and the Perfected Person leads. Seal your golden gate, let nothing depart; silence without sound, spirit endures long. When spirit and qi are complete, the gate of immortality opens. How easy the Great Dao, no longer vexing! Heaven’s Dao shows no partiality, turning to the benevolent and worthy 〈End〉 On Non-Action.

〈Beginning〉 The Law of Spontaneity, linked to the Dao, brings fortune when upheld, calamity when lost. Like the myriad things born whole, one root with ten thousand branches yet no spirit—ponder this, and the Dao reveals itself. All trace back to primordial chaos, emerging from the wondrous gate, neither adding nor diminishing, guarding spontaneity. All things born possess spirit, yet of eighteen hundred breaths, humans are supreme. Thus may one avoid death and become an immortal; those who perish early lose spontaneity. Even birds and beasts endure—how much more humans? The foolish scorn the Dao, their aspirations low, bound to earth; the benevolent and worthy treasure the Dao, swiftly ascending heaven’s gate. The spirit’s Dao does not die; the ghost’s Dao ends. You who wish to follow it, like a ring without end. Beware of eccentricity, lest it bring harm; neither recklessly abandon nor invite death. Heaven and earth’s nature uniquely honors spontaneity; each follows its course, daring no opposition. The Dao flourishes in non-action, emptiness, and spontaneity—noble scholars delight in it, lesser scholars resent it. Study carefully under a master, speak no reckless words; with a master, the Dao is clear; without, transmission is difficult. Learning without a master’s instruction, the noble person remains silent. Reckless action breeds chaos; self-mutilation invites misfortune. When the Dao is complete, spontaneity is achieved 〈End〉 Admonition on the Dao Completed.

*Taiping Jing*, Scroll 109: *"Essential Methods of the Dao: Text 174"*

Those who pursue the Dao take their instructions from the inner and outer critiques upon entering the chamber. When the appointed days are fulfilled, open the door and enter to observe. For those who have already critiqued themselves within, do not enter to inspect; for those who have not critiqued themselves, let the joyous ones enter to observe. When the door is opened and one enters to inspect, those wishing to depart may do so.

Those who inscribe the three Daoist conduct texts take their instructions from collective deliberation, treating it as Heaven’s trust, and thus elevate the person in question. Those who rectify the spirits take their instructions from the clarity of the myriad people, treating it as Heaven’s trust. Those who wish to correct ordinary texts take their instructions from collation and verification, treating it as Heaven’s trust. Those who delight in knowing the trustworthiness of our Daoist texts take their instructions from swift and decisive action, aligning with Heaven’s resonance. The good flourish daily, while the evil diminish daily—this is Heaven’s trust.

Those who wish to appoint and employ good people take their instructions from the nine persons. Those who inquire whether one has succeeded or failed in the chamber take their instructions from absolute clarity—form without concealment or obstruction, this is Heaven’s trust. Those who wish to know if they have attained the Dao in body and become deathless take their instructions from the body’s transformation into spirit, thus transcending the world—this is Heaven’s trust.

Those who wish to thoroughly understand the meaning of our texts read them from beginning to end, and their minds will become brilliantly illuminated, all doubts dispelled. Once the meaning is grasped, it cannot be forsaken. Those who wish to verify our texts as true or false take their instructions from governing toward the Great Peace by day—this is Heaven’s trust.

Those who wish to know whether longevity is attainable take their instructions from the era after the Great Peace. If the Great Peace has not yet arrived, the calamities of former generations will bring harm, making it difficult to fulfill one’s destiny—this is Heaven’s trust. Those who wish to know the Great Peace through the yang force take their instructions from the severing of metal. Those who wish to suppress and eliminate treacherous ministers and malevolent schemers through water and fire take their instructions from the severing of metal and the decline of the market’s wine.

Those who wish to see the Dao of Heaven flourish greatly take their instructions from collating all texts and the common people’s decisive words. Those who seek efficacious medicine take their instructions from collating all medical texts and verifying them. Those who wish to swiftly attain the Great Peace take their instructions from fully revealing the true texts and utterly eliminating the false ones.

Those who delight in ensuring people no longer kill or harm women take their instructions from each dwelling in their place, providing for their clothing and food according to their means, so they do not return to grieve their parents and rebel. Those who wish to eliminate illness and widely propagate the Dao take their instructions from swallowing the cinnabar script’s characters.

To know the essential methods of compiling and practicing the texts: follow their words, reiterate them earnestly, and bind them with good discipline. Practicing them for a single day dispels the harm of a hundred cunning hearts, transforming all in an instant to rectitude—this is Heaven’s trust.

〈Commencing〉
"May I ask, what is the meaning of *rui*?"
"Why do you feign ignorance?"
"I dare not feign it—I truly do not understand. I hope the Heavenly Master will not reject me but grant me a single word of instruction."
"Very well, sit calmly.

〈Commencing〉
*Rui* is purity, stillness, uprightness, rectitude, devotion, and unity. The heart aligns with Heaven and Earth, never transgressing the seasons’ commands."

"May I ask how one knows this purity, stillness, uprightness, rectitude, devotion, and unity?"
"Excellent is your question. The nature of Heaven and Earth, from ancient times to the present, ensures that the good attain goodness, the wicked attain wickedness, the upright attain uprightness, and the perverse attain perversity—this is the natural art, nothing strange about it. Thus, when the human heart is upright, pure, still, and utterly sincere, it moves Heaven; without evil intent, auspicious responses and good omens arise for it. If you wish to further know its great trustworthiness, the ancient sages and worthies all cultivated a heart of purity, stillness, devotion, and unity—hence they could summon auspicious responses."

〈Concluding〉
"All those who employ deceitful and false hearts receive no good responses—this is the great luminous proof of Heaven and Earth. Do you understand?"
"Indeed, indeed. But do they also receive responses?"
"Certainly—the perverse attain perversity, which is also their response. The unharmonious attain disharmony, and the harmonious attain harmony—this is the evident efficacy of Heaven’s response."
"Excellent! 〈Concluding〉 Excellent! Your foolish disciple now understands."

〈"Esoteric Writings Beyond the Canon"〉 "Secret Formula of Exceptional Deeds: Loyalty and Filial Piety" 175

〈Opening〉
"May I ask: when a person does good, what should the most filial sons, most loyal ministers, and most obedient disciples reflect upon and offer to their lords, fathers, and teachers?"
"They should offer the most exceptional, precious, and rarely encountered texts—those that attain the highest level."
"If loyal ministers, filial sons, and obedient disciples can always delight in such acts, why not offer what is commonly known rather than the exceptional?"
"What is commonly known, the highest already possess—why offer it again?"
"Your foolish disciple does not grasp the meaning."
"Soon I shall make you understand its truth. Whatever in the world is rare and prized—though never before seen—when offered to one’s lord, this is the act of the most loyal minister. Never-before-seen fine foods offered to one’s parents—this is the act of the most filial son. Never-before-heard teachings offered to one’s teacher—this is the act of the most obedient disciple. Do you understand?"
"Indeed, indeed. But why, when offering what is already possessed by the highest, do they still offer it again?"
"Such offerings are made in response to their expectations, and the fault of redundancy is not absolved."
"Why is this so weighty?"
"Since you still do not comprehend: what people already possess, they grow weary of—why offer it again? 〈Closing〉 To offer what others disdain is called redundant offering. To lower oneself and redundantly offer—does this not, in your view, incur blame?"
"Your foolish disciple now perceives."
"Thus, when obtaining auspicious responses and rare treasures, they should be offered to one’s lord, father, and teacher. What they already possess—take care never to offer again. Therefore, 〈Opening〉 from ancient times to the present, the great sages’ determination in all matters has been to discard the common and select the exceptional, thereby aligning with the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth—this is the meaning. 〈Closing〉 Do you understand?"
"Excellent! Excellent!"

**Disaster and Illness: The First Scroll on Concealment Secrets, One Hundred Seventy-Six**

"May I ask, Heavenly Master, by what means can one know when a text wishes to be enacted, and by what means can one know when it wishes to be concealed?"
"Do you seek clarity on this?"
"Observe the signs of disaster and illness as proof. When illness befalls a person upon its release, Heaven desires concealment. When illness befalls a person upon its concealment, Heaven desires its enactment."
"By what further means can this be made clear?"
"By the qi of Heaven’s four seasons in motion, which gives life and nurtures the myriad things, all in accord with Heaven’s intent. When all things delight in emergence yet are forced into concealment, great misfortune follows. When all things yearn for concealment yet are compelled to emerge, this too is great misfortune. Both violate Heaven’s mandate and will later bring forth great disasters. Do you delight in knowing that Heaven delights in its own course, and that this is not to be taken as divination? Do you, Perfected One, understand?"
"Indeed, indeed."
"Thus, from ancient times to the present, when affairs are undertaken without thorough consideration, Heaven’s Dao is lost, and the burden of inheritance arises. This is why the people are governed without the Dao, disrupting Heaven’s correct way, causing human governance to diverge, and thus the people and the myriad things suffer unjustly."
"I humbly ask: when there is no Dao, it is a law of capital punishment. Why does the Heavenly Master not establish severe penal laws to punish each according to their transgressions?"
"In the present age, affairs are already judged by their transgressions—this is fairness."
"Then why does the Heavenly Master not punish those without the Dao?"
"It cannot be done."
"Why?"
"For the ancients, their errors were but minor deviations from the Dao, mere lapses in conduct—not sufficient for punishment. Later generations inherit the burden, accumulating transgressions. Though their actions may invite death, their conduct is but empty and hollow. Later generations learn from their predecessors, and though they lose the Dao, governing without it, they transmit their ways through successive teachings, not one alone bearing the fault. Thus, they cannot be subjected to severe punishment. Reflecting on the transgressions of those in earlier ages, they are grave enough to warrant death. Yet the divine sages, in establishing laws, cannot suddenly impose heavy penalties that would extinguish human generations. Therefore, Heaven sent me down to reform their conduct, remove their burdens, and without exposing their faults, let Heaven, Earth, and humanity govern together, causing spirits to afflict them with illness and disaster. Later generations will see this as the manifest efficacy of the teachings I received from Heaven. Do you understand?"

"“Yes, yes.”
“Proceed. When the celestial discourse concludes, transmit its virtue to the virtuous ruler.”
“Yes, yes.”
“Go now, ask no more.”
“Yes, yes.”

Here ends the esoteric discourse on auspicious responses.

*Tai Ping Jing* Collated and Compiled, Scroll 109, Geng Section VII
*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 109

**Essential Record of the Two Hands’ Strategic Characters, One Hundred Seventy-Seventh**
**Opening Passage:**
Heaven possesses two hands, which together accomplish all matters. If one hand suffers from illness, evil, or malice, nothing can be achieved. Heaven greatly resents this; Earth regards it as taboo. The world falls into chaos and nothing succeeds—all due to that one hand’s evil and failure to join forces. When all matters remain unresolved and the six directions lack great peace, it is likewise because the two hands suffer from illness or evil and fail to unite their strength. Good fortune and ill, safety and peril—all arise from these two hands. Profound One, do you truly comprehend this deeply?
“Not fully. Only when the Heavenly Master reveals the essential meaning can I come to know it. Otherwise, I would remain in eternal darkness and confusion, with no way to understand. The master is the root of all teaching and transformation under Heaven and Earth. Though it be difficult, how could one not speak of it?”
“Excellent! The Profound One’s inquiry into matters is most apt. Has Heaven appointed you to pose these questions? Your words are essential and...” “Very well.”

Be seated, and I shall expound this meaning in full for all the Perfected Ones. When the world models itself upon and acts accordingly, no further misfortune or disorder shall arise. In the heavens, the gods call this the "Two Hands Strategy," recorded as an essential text. When a state practices it, it endures long; when common people practice it, they prosper for generations. The essential Dao is about to emerge, near at hand within the bodies of ordinary people. Now I shall distinguish and explain it for all the Perfected Ones.

“Indeed, indeed.”
“Heaven and Earth are the Two Hands that give birth to all things. The four seasons are the Two Hands that transmit and nourish all beings. The Five Phases are the Two Hands that transmit, complete, and deliver all things to one another. Man and woman, husband and wife, are the Two Hands that transmit and continue the Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth. Master and disciple are the Two Hands that transmit, teach, and communicate all matters, texts, and the Dao and virtue. Ruler and minister are the Two Hands that transmit and govern all matters, the people, and all things. These are six matters, merely lifting the guiding principles to reveal their beginnings—there are more than can be written. All things that require mutual support to accomplish are the Two Hands. In the heavens, this is called ‘double compasses and overlapping squares,’ all of which must correspond to one another. If one hand is perverse or unequal, nothing is accomplished. In the heavens, this is called the ‘governance of great disorder’; in the six directions and eight distant regions, it is called ‘widowers and widows, severed lineages,’ and the days grow ever more decadent. Without accomplishment, it is precisely because the Two Hands fail to join forces.”

“Excellent! Excellent! May I ask why the heavens rightly name this the Two Hands?”
“Excellent indeed is your question, for it grasps the meaning. The Two Hands signify their equality, unity of strength, neither advancing nor retreating, so that matters may afterward be accomplished. When the Two Hands do not join forces, matters cannot be accomplished. Thus, all things model themselves upon these Two Hands and must each find their proper person. When strength and hearts unite, modeling the Two Hands, the qi of good fortune, safety, and great peace immediately arrives. Those who do not model the Two Hands cannot, even after billions upon billions of years, bring forth the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Highest Sovereign. The qi of great peace constantly desires to emerge, just as Heaven constantly desires it through these Two Hands. If they are not long regulated and guided, it causes blockage, preventing its passage and governance, leaving one despondent and full of reproach. The fault lies in the Two Hands’ failure to harmonize. If the Two Hands are balanced and harmonious, the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Highest Sovereign emerges, arriving one after another without delay.

Excellent indeed! Thus, if Heaven and Earth do not join forces, the myriad things and all matters have no way to emerge. If the four seasons do not join forces, all things have no way to grow. If the Five Phases do not join forces, all things have no way to be completed. If ruler and minister do not join forces, all matters have no way to be governed. If husband and wife do not join forces, descendants have no way to grow, and the family way has no way to be established. If master and disciple do not join forces, no knotted matters can be untied, the Dao and virtue have no way to flourish, obscuring mists have no way to clear, and the great transformation of the six directions and eight distant regions has no way to proceed. Therefore, all must join forces, likened to the Two Hands, only then can there be communication. Not likened to the Two Hands, it daily brings misfortune. Even if one attempts to govern and heal it, there is no benefit, and still, there is no way to achieve success. Only prolonged, empty sorrow and daily distress ensue.

Thus, all that model the Two Hands must select and employ the proper persons. Those who do not find the proper persons, the gods in the heavens call ‘half-dead.’ If one does not hold to one hand and act alone, how can there be any accomplishment or success? Perfected One, you have come from afar to inquire for Heaven’s sake. All doubtful matters should be deeply pondered with this meaning and a sincere heart. The heart is born of fire and returns to be entrusted to fire. Govern and model the people, and you shall prolong life and increase years, not missing even one in ten thousand. I do not deceive you. Show this to the virtuous ruler and to all people. The worthy shall each ponder its meaning and dare not transgress it. To employ it is called enriching and nurturing oneself; not to employ it is called distressing and tormenting oneself.

Profound indeed! My Dao is the pure intent of Heaven. One may only advance, not retreat; one may only comply, not oppose. Compliance purely accords with Heaven’s heart; opposition brings disorder. When disorder and calamity surge, human intent goes west while Heaven’s intent goes east—this is called being at odds with Heaven’s intent.”
“Excellent! Excellent!”
“Go, for you may now be said to have awakened to this knowledge.”

〈Halt〉

**Four Auspicious and Four Inauspicious Outcomes, Formula One Hundred Seventy-Eight**

Before the Perfected Ones, 〈Rise〉 now when common people recommend scholars to present to the emperor, entrusting them to the state, 〈Halt〉 how many auspicious outcomes arise if the right person is obtained, and how many inauspicious outcomes if the wrong person is chosen? What can be achieved if the right person is obtained, and what can be overturned if the wrong person is chosen? Let the various Perfected Ones deliberate and respond with precision.

So it is. Obtaining the right person brings four auspicious outcomes; failing to obtain the right person brings four inauspicious outcomes.

If the right person is obtained, the heavens and earth, the six directions, and the eight distant realms are at peace. If the wrong person is obtained, the heavens and earth, the six directions, and the eight distant realms are not at peace.

I wish to hear the essential meaning.

So it is. When recommending a scholar and obtaining the right person, the ruler above is able to govern, achieving success and constant stability, daily benefiting the ruler—this is the first great auspicious outcome. The recommended person is capable of fulfilling their duties and becoming a vessel of talent—this is the second auspicious outcome. Becoming a vessel of talent, they can illuminate the Way of their teacher, extending grace to their teacher—this is the third auspicious outcome. The recommended person’s trustworthy service proves effective, further earning the ruler’s trust and employment—this is the fourth auspicious outcome. Together, with united strength and shared purpose, their endeavors daily succeed, monthly grow more illustrious, and yearly flourish more prosperously. The heavens and earth rejoice, good responses emerge in full, and evil things withdraw in concealment. When the heavens and earth rejoice, the host of spirits is pleased. If this is maintained without fail, above, one may transcend the world; in the middle, one may bring order and governance; below, one may preserve wholeness and complete one’s natural lifespan. When recommending a scholar and obtaining the right person, the good is thus. In heaven, this is called the *Talisman of Continuing Life*.

May I ask why it is properly named the *Talisman of Continuing Life*?

So it is. The reason it is called the *Talisman of Continuing Life* is that when the right person is recommended, danger is transformed into safety, chaos into order, failure into success, misfortune into fortune, and death into life. Above, one may transcend the world; in the middle, one may achieve governance and peace; below, one may complete one’s natural lifespan and preserve one’s body and form.

Now, when recommending a scholar and failing to obtain the right person, it brings no benefit to the emperor or the state, causing governance to descend into chaos. The emperor is distressed and afflicted, the heavens and earth are displeased, and thieves, bandits, disasters, and myriad calamities arise—this is the first great inauspicious outcome. The recommended person is incapable of governing their office, daily engaging in flattery and deceit. Over time, they await misfortune and cannot preserve their natural lifespan. Either the heavens and earth and spirits harm them, or they are murdered by others, bringing disgrace to their parents. Evil flows to their wives, children, and descendants, and even to their servants and followers, who come to know their faults and regard them as wicked people. 〈Rise〉 This is the second great inauspicious outcome. If the person is wicked, their learning is abandoned, defiling and disgracing the sacred work of former teachers and sages, bringing disaster upon their teacher—this is the third great inauspicious outcome. Furthermore, the recommender is untrustworthy, jointly deceiving their superior. Recommending the wrong person disrupts the celestial order, defiles the constellations, and incurs the wrath of heaven, the resentment of earth, the emperor’s displeasure, and the condemnation of sages and worthies. Such a one is called a great flatterer and liar of the age. For this offense, if they are not punished by the heavens, earth, and spirits, then people will harm them, disgracing their ancestors and bringing disaster to their wives, children, and descendants—this is the fourth great inauspicious outcome. Committing these four great inauspicious outcomes by recommending the wrong person causes the emperor distress and suffering, and governance to be called chaotic. Once harmful qi stirs and arises, it cannot be stopped. Disorder persists, with mutual blame and liability. The heavens and earth are enraged, the host of spirits wages war, the six directions are displeased, and the eight distant realms fall into discord. Eternally ungoverned, in heaven this is called the *Talisman of Diminishing Years and Shortening Life*.

Why is it named the *Talisman of Shortening Life*?

So it is. Governance should be long-lasting, but instead it is cut short; years should be many, but instead they are few. Undertakings meet with misfortune, bringing no benefit to the self. The heavens and earth are displeased, deducting from one’s allotted years. Thus, in heaven it is named the *Talisman of Shortening Life*.

Excellent! Excellent! This foolish student has heard your instruction.

"Ah, you may be said to have [understanding] of this. Carefully preserve this celestial text to show to virtuous rulers, to all worthy ones, and extend it to the common folk below. For those above who seek scholars, they must not be careless; for those below who present scholars, they must not be unfaithful. Let later generations transmit and recite this text, binding it within their hearts. If they hastily recommend scholars who do not meet this standard, the heavens and earth will no longer be pleased. To know this and yet deliberately violate it—how grave their transgression! Perfected One, be cautious."

"Indeed, indeed. I sincerely receive your instruction and dare not transgress the prohibitions, striving to practice it with all my effort."

"You may be said to be prudent in affairs, having received the Mandate of Heaven."

Only the Dao of highest antiquity cultivates the self and rectifies the person, daring not to transgress what the divine spirits record. Only then does one dare to seek life and beg for survival from the Heavenly Lord, not daring to act wantonly, fearing imperfection. Daily, one contemplates the vitality of life, serving the spirits as a subject, manifesting one’s kind. One desires to exhaust loyal and upright words, clearly distinguishing right and wrong with the spirits who govern each domain, only then daring to trust in the governance of right and wrong—how could there be a moment’s forgetfulness?

Above, there are those who observe humanity, fully knowing right and wrong. What can be concealed? What can be disbelieved? Thus, one attains self-governance, seeking to contemplate the root, never entering even the slightest realm of ungoodness. One simply cherishes having become human, relying on the primordial qi, enabling even the creeping and moving creatures to avoid witnessing calamities and anomalies. Yet humans betray trust in their sworn words, neither side believing the other, hence the lack of peace.

Within the harmony of heaven and earth, above and below, each has its own trust. Humans do not grasp its essentials, yet ask why there is good and evil alone. From whence do all calamities and anomalies arise? Humans consume the qi of the Five Constants, receiving without exception, depending without exception, acting without exception—why alone do they not honor and know the ancients who knew how to extend kindness to others? This is to lose goodness and follow evil, causing life to be incomplete—how could this be right?

Thus, the Heavenly Lord says there is good and evil, and goodness can be made uniform. The reason is that there must be distinction; one cannot follow one’s own will. Goodness should ascend, while evil should be punished—how can it be equated with goodness? From human perspective, this too is understandable, for there are those who ought to be upright. Thus, evil is established to clarify the intentions of heaven and earth, the four seasons, and the five phases, making known that completing life and giving birth are weighty matters, increasing one’s years of life.

Having attained the Dao of life and completion, one upholds its prohibitions, daring not to violate taboos. From this, it is clear that heaven knows the foolish are shallow and lack the intention of requital, opposing heaven’s actions, contradicting heaven’s deeds, and adding to human misconduct—reversing the proper order to reward evil and punish good.

Thus, the sage knows the convergence of yin and yang; the worthy govern right and wrong, resolving what is unknown, enabling each to know their allotted portion without resentment. Goodness naturally lengthens life; evil naturally shortens it—what is there to doubt or resent?

---
Are humans inferior to the six domestic animals, birds, beasts, and creatures of the water? Is it that humans are without form? Heaven causes it to be so. Heaven desires only that humans do good, not that they do evil. If good and evil shared the same suffering and joy, then wealth, honor, longevity, and old age—all granted by heaven above—would fail to distinguish beauty from ugliness, allowing ignorant people to boast, saying, “I am equal to you all.” What need is there for good conduct? Thus, advancing and increasing goodness prolongs life, while those of shallow understanding consider them equal.

Those who compare to evil and forfeit life, wishing to correct and repent their transgressions, seeing goodness and following it, seeing evil and retreating—day and night, they examine and reflect upon themselves, repaying what they owe. Even if they do not attain immortality, they may complete their allotted years without premature death—this is acceptable. The longing of common people is but a fleeting moment. Not contemplating long life, they may yet rise to become knowing scholars, their hearts set on seeking life, hence refraining from evil.

Heaven sees their goodness and allows them to act securely, further seeking wealth and descendants. Though they may not fully attain it, they still have hope—why persist in evil, hastening destruction, believing they can complete their years? They do not know that heaven dispatches spirits to record their deeds. No transgression, great or small, escapes heaven’s knowledge. The registers of good and evil are examined and tallied by year, month, and day, deducting from one’s allotted years. If evil does not cease, one is brought before the Ghost Gate. The earth spirits summon and interrogate them, comparing their words and deeds. After painful reflection and governance, they finally submit. Their names are sent up to the celestial bureaus for review; when their tally is exhausted, they are to enter the earth. Their transgressions flow into later lives—is this not the result of evil?

---
Why do humans not desire life? Having no mirror to see themselves, whom can they blame? Among children born in the same ten months, why alone do some fail to do good, persisting in evil—how can they endure long? The schemes of foolish scholars—why do they not align with even minor goodness? Engaging in trivial and non-urgent matters, each person’s actions differ in calculation, each believing their own way is right. What they touch and transgress all aim to benefit themselves, yet others do not wish to benefit them. The benefit of goodness brings fleeting life; the benefit of evil does not last, for goodness does not long remain upon the earth.

Thus, does heaven and earth not know this? Heaven causes humans to do good, hence it gives them life, yet they do evil. Thus, it sends the spirits who govern evil to follow them relentlessly. If they do not cease, other spirits ascend and immediately generate their affairs, causing them to follow the person without respite.

Do you not know? This scripture advances goodness and retreats evil—such is the literature of past and present. Yet one ceases not from pursuing long life and instead embraces evil, leaving no recourse; how can the spirits not report this? Thus, those who transgress vanish into the earth, their spirits unsettled, with no place to rest—whose fault is this? Let each person reflect deeply upon their conduct, seeking ease and peace without wrongdoing. Their words and phrases repeat and overlap, for what they speak of is not a single matter, hence the repetition.

Human life lies near within your own body—why then beat your breast and cry out to heaven? If you do not purify yourself, whom should you purify? If you do not cherish yourself, whom should you cherish? If you do not fulfill yourself, whom should you fulfill? If you do not reflect upon yourself, whom should you reflect upon? If you do not reproach yourself, whom should you reproach? Ponder these words, and you will bear no grudge against spirits. When they see goodness, they report goodness; when they see evil, they report evil—all is not the same.

Do you not understand? Though words may cease, if evil persists unchecked, the written records do not end; only when a person perishes do they stop. This warning makes clear that in doing evil, one burdens only oneself, not others—do you not understand? Act in accord with what is said, and let it remain in your heart; to depart from it is ruin, beyond repair. To stand among ghosts—how can one live? To think of life is to attain life—this is understanding. Evil must eventually end and cannot long endure—do you not know this?

Yet again, in trivial matters, people dwell between heaven and earth, each granted the chance to be human—how can they forget the grace of heaven and earth? What manner of folly is this? So foolish, yet unable to change—what more can one hope for? If you seek heaven’s reward, you must reproach yourself, act with sincerity, and weep tears of remorse. Say: "I have received grace to be human, set apart from all things, endowed by heaven with distinction—able to speak, to discern beauty and ugliness, to know good and evil. How can I not attend to these matters? I must reflect carefully." Yet if your words defy heaven, refusing to submit, you become one of great rebellion and un-Dao—how can heaven long engage with you?

Thus, the placement of baleful spirits follows the ancient observation: as the words say, such a person does not incline toward goodness. The Heavenly Lord declares: "Already the records are unceasing. The overseer of the department shall descend to gather their soul, their bones and flesh entrusted to the earth’s keeper. There is no need for delay—evil persons cannot be heard from repeatedly." Thus, one must restrain their wrath and return to refinement, reforming their evil, gathering all virtues, and embedding them within, placing the heart within the heart.

The spirits say: "We receive the heart’s mandate from heaven, charged to follow the human heart without the slightest lapse. Good and evil are instantly witnessed by attendant spirits, who also perceive the heart." The spirits speak with deep sorrow: "I know not whether fortune or misfortune lies ahead, and thus I fear being among the ranks of the wicked. Day and night, I reflect, uncertain where to place myself, and so dare not entertain even the slightest unwholesome thought. I rely solely on the forbearance of the spirits, allowing me to reproach myself. If I disregard their admonitions and am punished, I shall have no regret."

The Heavenly Lord sends a great spirit to declare: "This person has reproached themselves and repented of their transgressions, violating no prohibitions—grant them forbearance, grant them forbearance. If they later commit wrong, it will not be too late to seize them." Upon hearing the spirits’ words, they sigh day and night, fearing their past transgressions are not yet fully eradicated, that they have long been cut off from the qi of the great yang, and remain among the ranks of the dead, growing ever more distressed, not knowing what to do.

Having received the mandate but unable to fully comprehend it, they seclude themselves in quietude to examine their faults, reproaching themselves for the burdens they bear, and offering thanks to heaven and earth, the four seasons, the five phases, and all the spirits under their charge. The Heavenly Lord listens, commanding them to reflect deeply. The people of high antiquity all possessed wisdom and foresight, dared not violate prohibitions, cultivated and corrected themselves, feared even the slightest lapse, and acted without fail to comply with the mandate, lest they forfeit their years. For this reason, they dared not relax even slightly. With every transgression came punishment at the head, and thus they examined and cherished themselves, revered prohibitions, and dared not harbor even the slightest defiant thought. When reproached and questioned, their hearts trembled with fear, their qi dismayed, for they had betrayed heaven’s heart. Even a minor discrepancy in their words was deemed excessive, and they were immediately investigated and verified. What they said and believed could earn them renown, but if they lacked integrity, they would long forfeit their years.

Thus, they reflected again, never losing their true heart, ever fearful and anxious, daring not rest. They acted with restraint, always longing and yearning, desiring to align with heaven and earth, the four seasons, and the five phases, bearing their mandate without the slightest error. Their hearts grew indignant—how could they not deeply understand the profound intent before and behind, never deviating from constancy, cherishing grace without betraying sincerity? Longing for life and hoping to live, how could they allow even the slightest evil to reach above?

They bound their bodies and conducted themselves in accord with duty—how could they dare relax, fearing they might fail to attain the highest intent, not knowing what to do? Their hearts grew ever more anxious, finding no peace in self-comfort. The gift of heaven’s lifespan is hard to obtain; once lost, it cannot be regained. Long estranged from the common world, only to be cut down midway—looking back below, they are left dismayed, thus chastising themselves in trembling fear. They constantly fear that even a minor discrepancy may lead to their dismissal, sorrow and oppression weighing upon their hearts as they reproach themselves for their faults.

Having received heaven’s grace to fulfill their allotted mandate, they dare not forget the pangs of hunger and thirst, content merely to live. The great spirits, moved by compassion, record and instruct the people, who receive their qi from heaven’s kitchen and ride upon the qi of heaven. Yet their conduct is meager in what they govern, and the prohibitions are many—none may be lost or forsaken. Though their bodies may be lowly and unworthy of honor, they are not despised for their unworthiness.

Truly, with heart they seek advancement and strive for life, hoping the great spirits will review their words, allowing them to witness the generation and transformation of the four seasons and five phases, and to see the sun and moon—whose grace is hard to repay—lest they be cast aside midway.

The attendants of the True Abode dare not distance themselves, yet they pause, overturning their pillows and mats.

The great spirits declare: "This person has been thus transformed by their teacher—why fear they shall not receive protection?"

"In times past, there was such a one whom heaven favored with compassion, keeping them close at hand. Now, having long served in office and seen much, their thoughts and words find no want of the Celestial Lord’s trust. Moreover, in their deeds, they prostrate themselves weeping upon the earth, speaking forth only after being roused by decree. They recall the loyal sincerity of the ancients, advancing all they know without reservation, humbly receiving every word. How dare they compare themselves to those who came before?"

The great spirits say: "To speak with one so steadfast is to wish them to grow in conduct and emulate the ancients. Yet some fall short in their time."

The disciple replies: "The great spirits have illuminated the great principles with utmost clarity. Among the many, I alone am singled out, granted the gift of awakened thought—this grace is boundless. When shall I ever repay the great spirits’ instruction?"

The great spirits say: "Thought arises from within; its recompense lies in earnest devotion."

The disciple says: "I know not what to offer in service. Though heaven may possess rare and wondrous treasures, I still wish to present them. When roused by decree to fervent contemplation, I receive it with utmost sincerity. These words are not mere empty phrases of repayment, but a vow of unceasing day and night reflection, never daring to slacken."

The great spirits say: "The admonitions are many, and the remonstrances are not for one alone. To speak thus at length is to honor your sincerity, for your words are met with profound compassion."

The Celestial Lord, hearing this, summons the great spirits and asks: "From whence did this disciple arise, that they have drawn such exceptional words from the great spirits?"

The great spirits reply: "This learner is especially trustworthy, and thus the Way’s difficulty and ease are made clear."

The Celestial Lord says: "Let those who show goodness advance thus—this is as it should be."

The great spirits say: "The Celestial Lord summons this steadfast disciple."

The disciple says: "I dare not hope to stand at heaven’s left side. I only wish to remain in a humble station, exerting myself in loyal devotion."

The great spirits say: "All must have a domain to govern before their trustworthiness is proven."

"If I am thus truly fortunate, having received such great favor, I dare not fall short in even the smallest measure."

The great spirits say: "This disciple’s transformation is as it should be. They ought to advance further, matching the ancients."

The disciple says: "I dare not seek long life—such is the greed of others."

The great spirits say: "This is heaven’s wish."

The disciple says: "It is only by the great spirits’ protection that I dare not transgress their warnings."

The Celestial Lord, knowing of these two admonishing one another, approves deeply and bids them teach each other.

Of the Dao of the sages of highest antiquity, it arose naturally. Their minds knew the governance of heaven above, and all they enacted was foreknown. Their voices penetrated all, returning to perceive form and countenance. Gazing inward, their hearts were luminous, their intentions clear. They knew what must be saved, the convergence of fortune and misfortune—all was plainly discerned. Within, their hearts rejoiced, knowing they had received heaven’s blessing. They saw the deeds of those who came before, all cautioned with utmost sincerity. Reflecting on the grace of their favor and encounter, having long stood with the six spirits, they were ever instructed and warned, kept from peril. Gazing to the four directions, above and below all was open and unobstructed, their compassion deepening. Their hearts filled with joy, their lives extended, and what they had not heard was now revealed—all by the power of the Celestial Lord and the great spirits’ transformation.

The great spirits say: "All the spirits know this: those whose lives are prolonged have their fate recorded in truth. Before their birth, their years, months, days, and hours were inscribed in the Bureau of Longevity. As their years increase, their names are bestowed and made known, governed by the Perfected of the Northern Culmen. Their bones are transformed, their bodies become light and lustrous, radiating brilliance. At dusk, they receive the elixir, refining their essence. Wherever they manifest, all comes to fruition. They move from the subtle to the hidden, within the space of a single hair—what is there they cannot penetrate?"

The *〈Cease〉* section—The Sage says: "Truly, there is this following of custom: food comes from the earth, and the yin spirits emerge—how could one not be weighty? What is called ‘ease’ in transformation is, in fact, the highest ease. The great spirits’ grace cannot be repaid; their great deeds bestowed, their boundless kindness—how could one bear to fall short? They allow one to rest and breathe in profound depth, a debt no words can repay."

The great spirits say: "This is the mandate of Heaven, matching human fate and allotted years—it is not by the will of the great spirits’ doing. When goodness is recommended, it is the blessing of the spirits—what repayment or gratitude could there be? Yet, fearing future doubts, we impose prohibitions and firm rules, so that the Sage may teach and warn, and later generations may see and understand. The Sage already possesses wisdom—no admonition is needed."

The Sage says: "Though I have received such recompense and my name is recorded in the registers of life, there may still be teachings I fail to grasp."

The great spirits say: "Such humble words from one alive are fitting indeed."

The disciple, deeply moved, speaks again, his earlier and later words now complete: "Only by the great spirits’ gracious fulfillment do I see my place among others—yet I dare not relax, nor grow arrogant or indolent. I ask to exert myself further in quiet solitude, following the great spirits’ teachings, ever mindful of this unworthy life."

The great spirits say: "All your words, before and after, are clear—no further warnings are needed. Let each part accordingly as spoken."

The disciple says: "From the day I received these precepts, I dare not slacken even for a moment, though I fear I may not fully accomplish them. Only by your support do I live and breathe again, my hopes revived. My heart remains ever inclined toward you—may the great spirits, from time to time, grant further instruction. This grace is no small thing."

The great spirits say: "Such words from you are fitting indeed."

The disciple says: "Indeed, indeed. I dare not rely on myself alone for protection."

The great spirits say: "Those who attain a name must advance with diligence—benefits accrue, and the overseers of the departments are many."

The Celestial Lord, hearing this exchange of warnings and words between the great spirits and the Sage—knowing them to be men of understanding—commands: "Do not grow careless or lax. Your lives may reach boundless longevity. Return each to your respective departments, and when you see goodness, advance it to the great spirits."

The Sage says: "We all receive the Celestial Lord’s teaching and will exert ourselves to the utmost, never growing weary in our efforts."

The Celestial Lord says: "Those who perfect themselves do so by their own perfection."

"Indeed, indeed."

〈Rising〉

In the highest antiquity, those who attained the Dao had no statutes or records to follow. Their records were inscribed in the scriptures of long life, and when the appointed year, month, and day of their ascension arrived, these were transmitted to the Central Ultimate. The Central Ultimate is also called Kunlun. The overseers of each department would then record their names without omission. Envoys were repeatedly dispatched to test their limbs—bending, extending, turning, and swaying—repeating instructions and admonitions, commanding the spirits to flex and bow. Medicinal drafts were administered to open and refine their bones and joints. Though they might not meet face-to-face, the envoys could discern whether their resolve was firm or faltering, ensuring their will did not waver.

Craving life and dreading death, they aspired to join the gods of heaven. Envoys were sent to verify their years, and only then were they permitted to receive the scriptures of insufficiency. Their spoken words and intentions were made known, teaching them the prohibitions and precautions to observe. These were transmitted to disciples, who, without relying on divine texts, carried their own books to completion. The gods, recognizing their speech, would engage with them over years, accumulating one thousand three hundred and twenty days before leading them to meet the great spirits, to circulate primordial qi and walk the path of spontaneity.

The Celestial Lord reviewed the secret decrees in the registers, ensuring no private trust or partiality influenced their conduct, lest their hearts be swayed or their actions err. The great spirits said: "We have calculated the provisions lent by the various gods. On the last day of the eighth month, the registers of all mountains, seas, mounds, marshes, connecting rivers, bridges, the Huai, Ji, Yangtze, lakes, and waterways—recording their influx and efflux—are to be clearly divided. The Celestial Lord’s rewards and recorded decrees are to be reviewed repeatedly before the Celestial Lord, and the registers stored in the Golden Chamber. Those of sincere heart, appointed to attend the Celestial Lord’s inquiries, must heed his teachings day and night without respite. The overseers of the chambers must not lose what their departments seek. Separate orders shall identify those of sincere heart who are to be definitively recorded in the registers.

Envoys and gods shall be assigned to tally the names of those to ascend or descend. One hundred days prior, all documents must be submitted without omission or loss. If any document is inconsistent or the accounting office fails to act, all involved shall be held accountable. A prior decree forbids transgressing the divine scriptures. After this scripture is issued, it shall be shown to the common people only after three years and eight months. Those who believe in the Dao may be shown it in full."

The Celestial Lord instructed: "These people bear prior burdens. Command the gods to resolve and conceal them. Those not yet concealed shall be concealed." The great spirits said: "These people have long suffered poverty and emptiness, fearing they cannot preserve themselves. By the Celestial Lord’s favor, the gods are commanded to conceal them. If their overseers fail to do so, their words may prove unreliable. They have previously petitioned for decrees to express gratitude and receive grace. Though the appointed time has not yet come, let them be informed one month in advance."

The Celestial Lord said: "Instruct the gods, generals, and soldiers under your command in the fields and lands not to miss the season for concealment. Record their names so the earthly overseers may treat them with reverence, allowing divine spirits to come and go. Those who seek to fulfill their wishes shall be heard." 〈End〉 "Have faith in this, and thereafter be vigilant."

The great spirits said: "Thus, word will spread throughout the realm. Those who love the Dao will support and uphold one another, honoring and serving it." The Celestial Lord said: "Those who have merit shall naturally be honored." The great spirits said: "This person’s years are not yet complete, and the appointed time has not arrived. I request that when the time comes, they be taught how to offer thanks. For now, their dwelling is empty, and they have nothing to clothe themselves. Let those who possess the Dao provide them sustenance until the appointed time."

The Celestial Lord said: "This is a small matter. Let the Celestial Offices provide for their households—those with households and sincere hearts." The great spirits said: "Let it be as you have instructed." "Command the Celestial Offices to provide what is due. This person has long been empty; let them be given food to suffice." The great spirits said: "Let the Celestial Offices record their names and ensure they do not suffer want." The Celestial Lord said: "Very well."

In ancient times, all people received the celestial retribution they deserved, and those whose faith could be fulfilled were granted life by decree, protected and watched over by the spirits, who feared any harm or deficiency might befall them. Day and night, they divined their fate. When they saw goodness, they aided their joy; they did not wish to hear of their wrongdoings. They were placed in the registers of longevity, their hearts guided toward goodness, ensuring no time for evil. They were encouraged to advance in virtue, to harbor filial piety, loyalty, and obedience. In all they received and practiced, they dared not act on their own will but followed the teachings they were given. Others might call them ignorant, yet I, too, saw and knew them.

When a person possessed great kindness and mercy, they grieved and reflected, striving to be good. Yet if one remained long in doubt, especially loathing the prospect of an early demise, they would restrain and discipline themselves, fearing to offend the wicked. Day and night, they trembled in dread, uncertain of their fate. Heaven endows people with the knowledge of good and evil; those who act with goodness and faith do not wish others to hear of their wrongdoings. Thus, desiring to cling to life and avoid death, they dared not transgress prohibitions, as if such violations would harm their very bodies.

Therefore, by the affinity of celestial qi, they could converse and interact with those of understanding, discerning the sentiments of others. When they saw unworthiness, they withdrew and reproached themselves, fearing their names might be sullied in the records. Whatever intentions they harbored at the time, if they acted upon others, they dared not face the full account of their deeds but reproached themselves for what they had done. Yet if their actions displeased others, their faults multiplied and were difficult to erase.

Thus, when people came to regret their missteps, their circumstances changed in the moment, and they believed their fate could be regained. Unaware that Heaven had sent great spirits to divine their misdeeds as particularly grave, they had already entered the earth, and so they consoled themselves, enduring in silence, not daring to confront their wrongs. Though their words bore slight discrepancies, having received Heaven’s grace, they were granted a brief respite to revive and rest, holding onto the hope of prolonged life—this was Heaven’s dispensation. Yet even so, they felt their allotted time was short, and thus grew ever more despondent, their hearts filled with shame.

They longed to see the celestial spirits, to plead for mercy and instruction, to illuminate what they did not know, to guard against the future, and to align with Heaven’s will, that they might achieve even a small measure of their desires. Those who were calculating and covetous pondered good and evil, hoping to receive unseen decrees. Then, they beheld the great spirits, bitterly recounting the hardships of their lives, seeking the favor of worldly men and striving for advancement. Thus, they cultivated and corrected themselves.

Only the great spirits admonished their insufficiencies, awakening them to the hope of warning and the leftward turn of fate. The great spirits alone pitied and examined those who sought life. The great spirits said: "Why惜 the prohibitions? Reflect deeply and know them yourself. Let your words freely express your true feelings, but fear they may not match your speech. Consider carefully, for thoughts arise from the heart; you must ponder them thoroughly."

The petitioner said: "I am overwhelmed with gratitude and fear, for these matters concern my very self. How dare I not speak from the heart?" The great spirits said: "Since this is your resolve, return now to a quiet place and reflect. Only when you find insufficiency should you seek further." The petitioner said: "I am slow and unlearned, not yet fully versed in the prominent precepts. I prostrate myself, awaiting your instruction, before daring to advance." The great spirits said: "If you wish to exhaust your sincerity, merit can be attained. Strive to reflect on your life from its beginning, on the progress of your deeds, and on resolving the burdens inherited from your ancestors. When these burdens are removed and your transgressions exhausted, you shall ascend—what doubt remains? Be cautious in your speech and do not let your thoughts wander."

The petitioner said: "Having received your decree and admonitions, I dare not withhold any effort in advancing goodness. If I turn from good to evil, I toy with my own fate." The great spirits said: "A good person should humble themselves further. Though the days of their life may be laborious and the present moment slightly bitter, if they do not waver in their resolve, they shall later receive blessings."

The petitioner, having received the decree, sincerely retired to a quiet place to reflect on their faults and reproach themselves. The great spirits said: "Thoughts that arise from within are known to the celestial spirits. Do not grow weary." The petitioner said: "I shall do so until the end of my years." The great spirits said: "With such conduct, why fear you will not advance?"

The Celestial Lord, having heard this, further instructed the great spirits to observe the conduct of those who wished to progress, to accumulate the days and months of their deeds, and to assign each to their proper register. Those with merit would ascend, and their names would fill the vacancies. The people of ancient times, in their hearts, words, and speech, understood human nature and governed without deception. Their inner and outer selves were in harmony, and their sincerity was fully evident; none betrayed another. Heaven’s essential decrees were such that transgressors were deemed most shameful, immediately questioned, and held accountable for their faults.

For this reason, they trembled all the more, their hearts moved by the profound grace Heaven had bestowed, allowing them to remain whole as human beings and to know the meaning of good and evil. People, reflecting on this deep and generous favor, knew not how to repay it. They could only resolve to advance, their loyalty and sincerity unwavering. In all they did, they followed the commands and dared not err even slightly, fearing that the multitude of spirits would report them, that their faults would be seen above, and that their allotted years would not be fulfilled.

Thus, they grew ever more sorrowful and anxious, not daring to relax, yet hoping to repay the grace they had received. Truly, they coveted life and wished to serve the celestial spirits in accordance with Heaven’s will. Those with small transgressions would have them erased, completing their allotted years. If they had great merit, their lives would be extended, and their years increased. Serving the primordial qi, aligning with the essence and brilliance of what they knew, they would receive great favor—beyond words to repay—leaving only their hearts uncertain of how to proceed.

Only the great spirits, in their compassion and records, could provide instruction, allowing them to perceive and consider, to know Heaven’s decrees and the multitude of prohibitions above. They were to follow these without fail. The great spirits, mindful of their insufficiencies, admonished them and dared not forget the greater dispensation, nor the grace of life they had received. The great spirits said: "You are one who knows yourself. What need is there for further instruction? Simply follow Heaven’s will and do not oppose its intent."

Upon receiving these admonitions, they should promptly comply and not neglect them—this is how one aligns with the will of Heaven. Rewards and punishments vary in weight; each must be met with due sincerity, without error or misstep. Even the slightest caution I offer should be carefully heeded. In speech, one must deliberate thoroughly to ensure its feasibility. Should minor transgressions arise, one must reflect inwardly and turn toward goodness—this is the essence of minor admonition. For all else, one must take lifelong words as profound warnings, never deviating from the intent of the spirits.

"You, still in youthful ignorance, have yet to grasp the greater dispensation. Thus, the great spirits repeatedly admonish you. Their illumination is vast, their knowledge and foresight boundless, encompassing all things. The great spirits emphasize these warnings so that you may embody their virtue and not oppose their words. You must reflect deeply and await further instruction."

The great spirits said: "These words allow one to understand the dispensations of Heaven above, the workings of the earth below, and the conduct of all beings in between—all in accord with the law, without deviation. Those who have teachers should follow their masters and not oppose them."

The disciple replied: "I am resolved to heed these warnings. Though the laws are the same, my understanding of their intent remains shallow. The will of Heaven is difficult to fathom in its entirety."

The great spirits said: "All that is required is unwavering sincerity, free from deceit. Those who can anticipate the intentions of the Heavenly Lord in advance are the foremost of people, worthy to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side. When rewarded for their merits, they remain humble and dare not accept all that is given, instead redoubling their efforts, exerting themselves to the utmost, and cultivating a mind of utmost subtlety. Thus, the Heavenly Lord personally instructs them face-to-face—this is the disciple’s great fortune. With many under their care, they govern with impartiality—this is sufficient in itself."

The disciple said: "I dare not aspire to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side; merely to live is enough. I think only of loyalty and filial piety, following principle and fulfilling my duties. I dare not accept great rewards, for I fear I have no merit to justify them. Yet when even small deeds bear fruit, my person grows brighter with each passing day, and I am granted long life. My thoughts are boundless, and I dare not allow even a moment’s lapse in reflection. To receive gentle words fills my heart and mind to abundance. The great spirits dwell with me, guiding my conduct without ceasing. Though I have received such grace—moving between Heaven and earth, occasionally admonished—this is the great spirits’ benevolence, which I can never fully repay. My heart remains ever devoted, never wavering in its longing. When the Heavenly Lord hears of this, He knows the conduct of His followers, and none fail to have their wishes fulfilled. I constantly examine my faults and shortcomings, striving to avoid even the slightest wrong. The great spirits instruct and admonish me, urging me ever upward without weariness.

"The most virtuous of people arise naturally, each with a long record inscribed in the register of goodness, known as the *Record of the Virtuous*. Their conduct is always good, never marred by ill repute. In all their comings and goings, only kind intentions are heard, never evil—hence they are called *the virtuous*. Their every action advances them among others, and the multitude marvels at what they cannot see, elevating them to honor. The honored observe them, some admiring their words, others their virtuous conduct, their sincerity, their beloved nature, their filial loyalty, the constancy of their speech, or their trustworthiness—such is the goodness of the good. Thus, they are named *virtuous*. At times, they are favored with glory, yet they still desire to wander long, to attain immortality among the spirits, to reach the station of deathlessness, to command the host of spirits—these are the desires of the virtuous.

"They look upward to goodness, aligning with the trust of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the five phases. The spirits cherish them, those with knowledge instruct one another, rare texts and extraordinary strategies are shared, and vacancies are filled through mutual recommendation and assurance. Even slight dissent is corrected, and precious gifts are exchanged. Together, they ascend to the heavenly spirits, seeking reverence, admonition, and reflection on their faults, fearing they may not measure up to the great spirits of Heaven. Day and night, they advance their resolve, embracing goodness from the heart, yearning to hear virtuous words. Their loyalty and integrity are whole, and they cherish their lives and years, ever fearful of even a moment’s lapse into slight unkindness. When they hear of others’ faults, they aid in their repentance. They guide those with knowledge, admonishing with goodness, heeding others’ words, and witnessing their glory. They teach others the way to seek life and vitality—this is the pinnacle of the virtuous. They strive to merit reward, never daring to defy the wishes of the spirits, longing to remain ever in their presence and fulfill the aspirations of all they encounter.

"Only the great spirits of Heaven, masterful in speech, oversee and instruct conduct, enforcing prohibitions. Even minor faults are met with forbearance, allowing one to reflect on their intent. The grace of Heaven is vast, its compassion boundless, granting one the chance to reflect, repent, and extend their life—this is the dispensation of the greater dispensation. Yet I fear I may not fully realize this grace in the end. I pray the great spirits will pardon my shortcomings. I wish to receive unseen admonitions, to find joy in reflection, to broaden my aspirations, and to receive further instruction."

The great spirits said: "Heaven and Earth each have their own patterns. One knows how to advance but not how to retreat—this is simply their nature. They do not withhold admonition out of stinginess. When one sees the multitude of virtuous people, what further warnings are needed? Simply ponder their words carefully to ensure they align—this is the wish of the virtuous, and it should be made clear."

The disciple said: "I am unworthy, my conduct impure. Thus, I have personally sought the prohibitions of the great spirits. Repeatedly, I have received their profound favor, their constant remembrance, and their manifest guidance, returning again and again without satiety—Heaven has willed it so."

The great spirits said: "You have received a natural disposition, and Heaven has sent you to inquire. It knows your alignment—what cause for suspicion is there? Those who secretly wish to receive instruction speak only from their true feelings, without artifice or embellishment. Few can truly correct themselves from the heart, so vacancies are filled through mutual supplementation—this is your shortcoming. You must remain vigilant and not grow lax."

The disciple said: "My nature is dull and slow, my intentions not ahead of time. I rely only on written precepts for self-restraint—would that I were not so pitied."

The great spirits said: "This too arises from understanding. When one knows goodness, one practices goodness; when one knows trustworthiness, one practices trustworthiness; when one knows loyalty, one practices loyalty; when one knows obedience, one practices obedience; when one knows filial piety, one practices filial piety—how then could evil ever precede? You already possess this self-awareness, which is why we emphasize it further."

The disciple, sincerely dismayed, said: "What I have heard is most excellent. Within it lies a profound admonition. How could I dare harbor any thought of negligence when the great spirits instruct thus? This is the very meaning of preserving life. To receive such favor—how could I ever repay the great spirits' kindness?"

The great spirits said: "Observe these matters, and they are not merely for caution. If you reflect on what can be practiced, you may yet achieve renown and ascend without doubt. What is attained through one’s own conduct—how could there be any repayment or gratitude? Words alone are insufficient to convey it."

The disciple said: "This admonition grants me life and the hope of survival. I shall ponder your words in my ignorance."

The great spirits said: "You must ensure your words do not depart from your inner truth. This is how we have admonished all who come to learn."

The disciple said: "Who would willingly instruct me thus? My fate is my lot, and the great spirits take pleasure in it. Though your teachings are thorough, I have nothing to offer in return—truly, I am ashamed and at a loss."

The Heavenly Lord heard this and said: "This is goodness within goodness, the very essence of virtue. It may be applied across all departments without fail."

The great spirits then addressed the disciple: "The Heavenly Lord’s decree bestows such honor—you must not transgress it."
"Indeed, indeed."

Those of supreme virtue stand between Heaven and Earth, presiding over the work of transformation, ensuring all attain their desires. When the good inscribe the writings of goodness, they do not lose constancy or propriety—this is supreme virtue. Nothing is left unaccomplished, nothing unachieved. They do not lose their clarity, nor their substance; they do not lose the generative workings of yin and yang, nor the qi of the four seasons that govern life’s ingress and egress. They do not lose the completion of the Five Phases, nor the movements of the sun, moon, and stars; they do not lose their measurements, nor the timing of fortune and misfortune; they do not lose the signs of calamity and anomaly, nor the records of flood and drought. Human lifespans, long or short, do not lose their allotment according to the thickness or thinness of their stellar influences—these are the duties of those of supreme virtue.

Thus, those of virtue illuminate all, perceive all, harmonizing above, below, and the center, each according to its proper place. In accordance with their virtue, none lose their rightful names. This is the scripture of following the constant and attaining long life. None fail to receive glory. All things sprout and split their husks to grow, their branches and leaves unfurling like garments; mist, dew, frost, snow, and timely rain serve as their drink and food. They grow, mature, and bear fruit, covering the earth and sustaining its people. Called the "water mother" by Heaven, the "gourd" by the people, in the scorching heat of summer, they serve as water and drink—all under Heaven look up to them, and none, great or small, do not partake. Such is the virtuous person who inherits Heaven’s mandate, completes Heaven’s form, and on Earth provides sustenance for the people. Their acts of kindness and bestowal extend virtue to all, filling and satisfying themselves—this is not Heaven’s grace but their own.

Yet Heaven’s generative work is vast, and those who defy its mandate speak of "naturalness" in rebellion—this is perverse. Thus, those of virtue, understanding Heaven’s intent, teach the people to establish laws without losing Heaven’s will, nurturing and raising them to maturity, enabling them to become human. They further comprehend the patterns of culture, cultivating virtue to completion, and may ascend to join the celestial scholars. The affairs of Heaven above are graded by merit. Those of virtue preside over Earth’s matters, enabling the people to rely upon and witness their benevolence, though they cannot repay it in kind.

Those of virtue enact Heaven’s qi, above and below, at the center. When people fail to find their proper place, they belittle Heaven’s works, provoking Heaven’s unceasing wrath. The spirits do not love humanity, and lifespans are diminished—yet people blame Heaven, not themselves. How profound their folly! Thus, the lower spirits record these teachings, establishing prohibitions to firmly restrain the people from transgression.

Those who foresee the future shun evil and pursue goodness, avoiding what is forbidden, and again behold the transformations wrought by Heaven’s Dao—none fail to follow them. Thus, rulers are made their wings, guiding head and tail, completing their works like city walls, clear and discernible. They understand the great transformations, ordering the primordial qi, and comprehend human affairs. These are the people of fortune and fate, all foreknown. As they transform, their lifespans may be extended, and Heaven loves them. Good spirits follow and protect them, preventing harm. Their hearts perceive goodness, and the wicked cannot compare. Thus, Heaven values goodness, enabling them to fulfill their wishes without encroachment or conflict, as in equilibrium. Those who excel in goodness have their lifespans increased by Heaven, spared from peril and entanglement—this is great grace. How could repayment be doubted?

Those who previously performed great goodness, aligning their conduct with Heaven’s will, draw near to its left side, where no evil qi approaches. They dare not look upon it, and their lifespans extend without end—this grace is beyond repayment, not through rare treasures, but by inscribing sincerity in the heart, being true and trustworthy, and not betraying one’s words. This is repayment. Is this not repayment, is this not understanding?

To know goodness and practice goodness, to see trustworthiness and practice trustworthiness—these are a person’s strengths. You should reflect upon this and not doubt yourself. There were once trustworthy people whose lives knew no end, transforming into spirits, their virtues complete and merits abundant—do you understand this?

Thus, those of virtue who possess understanding may advance, and Heaven deeply loves them. Though their writings are not grand, they know fate and do not resent Heaven. Each conducts themselves with care, avoiding wrongdoing and perversity. Teaching others to do good, they again align with Heaven’s will, and their lifespans naturally lengthen."

All affairs issue from the Heavenly Lord—none may be detained or halted. The common folk are difficult to transform; transform them gradually, without sudden violence. Weigh carefully what you say, lest the spirits record it. Each must attend to their own duties, for documents and ledgers have their own fixed measures—do not transgress them. When you see goodness, advance it; when you see evil, correct it—let no doubt remain. Those who covet life do not forget what Heaven bestows.

Thus, those who honor this do so out of sincere care for human life. Reflect on goodness, and goodness will come—longevity will follow without doubt. Does the Heavenly Lord not love trustworthiness and understanding?

Examine the divine texts with care; do not test them on your own. Among all things under Heaven, filial piety, loyalty, sincerity, and trustworthiness are the greatest—thus, do not indulge in reckless abandon. To seize or diminish another’s allotted span will not endure long. Be cautious, be ever cautious, and do not grow lax, for laxity breeds self-doubt. Doubt renders one unworthy—do you understand? Do you understand?

*Great Sage’s Supreme Petition, Chapter 180*

〈Right [Section]:〉
Only those of supreme sagely virtue from the very beginning may receive the primordial qi and naturally resonate with its radiant essence, thereby becoming great sages. They fully comprehend what ought to be enacted, ever aligning with the celestial will without straying from the intent of the primordial qi. They constantly serve as grand divine ministers and assistants, akin to the dukes and ministers of a state. Their minds grasp the directives of the great spirits, and they communicate through celestial writs. Each petition they submit is duly recommended and elevated, ensuring the right individuals are chosen to safeguard matters of speech and action. They employ the Heavenly Lords in their affairs, and when the Hall of Light receives the writs, they are transmitted without delay, securing the favor of the celestial court.

The Heavenly Lord declares: "Those who do not disrupt the court’s decrees, nor entrust matters to unworthy intermediaries, shall see their documents submitted in perfect balance, free from grievances or disputes. Each receives their due portion of grace, with rewards and punishments meted out accordingly—how could there be contention over such distinctions?"

The great sages foresee the actions the Heavenly Lord ought to undertake—how could there be error? Common folk, unaware, assume them akin to mortal officials—how could they comprehend the edicts and writs that ought to descend? In the celestial realm, voices carry across vast distances—how could anything remain concealed? This is governed by the natural order of mutual verification—how could there be a moment of escape? The Heavenly Lord, day and night, foreknows all affairs, great and small, within the harmony of Heaven, Earth, and the Center. What autonomy do the spirits possess? Thus, the deeds of good and evil are recorded from beginning to end, and the spirits are tasked with transcribing them. The Heavenly Lord personally follows the monthly progress of the Dipper’s handle to govern, never deviating from the eternal intent, and all are rectified without敢 defiance. Hence, it is said: "Heaven dispatches."

The spirit within the human abdomen communes with Heaven from afar, their voices heard across the distance—how could they not know the good and evil of the people? The Heavenly Lord declares: "The virtuous and trustworthy are promoted; the wicked and untrustworthy are demoted." Not only does Heaven desire trustworthy individuals, but so too do the Center and Earth below. People, however, lack deep understanding of future matters, so those whose hearts and wills endure alongside the great spirits are deemed closest to Heaven. This is akin to a state’s loyal ministers and upright officials, who never stray from the ruler’s side. Yet people distrust Heaven—when would Heaven ever trust those of divided loyalty?

〈Right [Section]:〉
Are those who do not serve Heaven inferior even to common folk? How could insects and ants, driven by greed and attachment to life, ever align with the will of Heaven? Such individuals are not favored in their time. Transgressions arise among the people, and the thirteen [lunar phases] are gathered in the end, each with its allotted span. Those with heart and will, who disregard worldly affairs and seek advancement for the sake of life, are informed by the spirits of their innermost thoughts. Only those with heart and will may engage in dialogue and be trusted; the heartless, driven by the clamor for food, profit, warm clothing, and full meals, waste resources on empty rituals, oppress the poor and weak, and exalt themselves as superior—these are not the trusted confidants of Heaven. Their conduct lacks purity, yet they still seek the Dao and long for immortality. Such pursuit is futile, their crimes grave, and moments of pardon rare. Do you understand this?

Those who ascend to Heaven in broad daylight seek life with recorded destinies, their names inscribed in the celestial registers of the Northern Culmen Heavenly Lord, with copies of their allotments. How could those without heart and will ever have their names recorded? Those who study earnestly and earn the trust of Heaven’s heart may fulfill their celestial years. Those who exert themselves with exceptional effort and merit may have their names stricken from the register of death, gaining a brief reprieve in life. When will they ever ride the refined qi and perform Heaven’s work?

〈Right [Section]:〉
This is why one must comprehend the writs and be moved to remorse, weeping in self-reproach: "I, like the child of the tenth month, have acted, yet alone fail to meet the celestial intent, remaining among the ranks of the dead. What single act of mine has not aligned with the will above? This is my fault." Heaven, Earth, and the Center all ought to follow the grace of Heaven, yet many disbelieve—such is the gravity of their transgression. How can they harbor hope? When the celestial spirits hear of one who reproaches and repents, laboring without respite day or night for years, that person may be pardoned and reported to the Heavenly Lord. The Heavenly Lord declares: "Those who reproach themselves and repent their errors shall have their names transferred by the spirit of life’s register to the Bureau of Longevity. They shall be granted a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years, and those who were poor shall have descendants, while those of short-lived, solitary lineages—such as the wealthy and noble—shall be given heirs." Why is this? The wealthy and noble, with their strong households and abundant resources, defy Heaven and Earth, harm others, and bring ruin to the world. They hoard wealth, causing countless deaths and injuries. Thus, Heaven does not grant them descendants. If their wickedness persists, how could they be rewarded with goodness and longevity? Do you understand this?

The great spirits dispatch lesser spirits to transmit decrees, each receiving their mandate—matters of longevity or brevity proceed without doubt. Reflect again and again: the writs make clear both great and small matters. Should there be omissions or errors in later records, they must be duly noted.

*Virtue and Destiny, Chapter 181*

〈Right [Section]:〉
Only the Most High and those of virtue possess their own principles, deeply understanding affairs before they unfold. Their insight illuminates above and below, leaving nothing unopened. Their thoughts never stray from within, and they exhaust all knowledge to uphold the great transformation, rightly ordering the world. All they undertake and expound is fitting and timely. Their sincerity reaches the four directions, their intent ever in communication, rectifying the celestial net and placing the stellar lodges in their proper positions across the four quarters. Each is arrayed with its own patterns, their movements governed by constancy, their destinies bound above and below, each with its allotted span. On the day of one’s birth, the attendants in the celestial chambers record and inscribe the registers—nothing may be forgotten. Those born in the *zi* or *wu* hours shall have long lives. Those born in the *chou* or *wei* years shall not stray from the earthly domain. Those with meager destinies must avoid evil, lest they be consigned to the earthly domain.

When the allotted span is not yet exhausted, the celestial registers remain at one’s side, and though one may encounter the kingly and ministerial phases of the months, the qi of the monthly establishment will not endure. The reason lies in the earthly domain: thus, those born in the regions of *Kun* and *Gen* shall see their lifespans naturally diminished. If one’s birth occurs at the proper time, with the three earthly branches in alignment, yet the day of birth does not advance, its worth is as mere coin. From year to year, there are few favorable moments.

In the years of *chen* and *xu*, the Celestial Gate and Earthly Door stand opposite, and the celestial and terrestrial soils govern the births of their time. The celestial soil gives rise to the grasses and trees above, the terrestrial soil to those below; the celestial soil produces sages and the wise, while the terrestrial soil yields the worthy. Though there be balances, the ranks of the scales do not interfere with one another. People, unaware of this, instead claim that years in *chen* or *xu*, when the monthly establishment clashes, are profoundly inauspicious. Yet the Celestial Gate and Earthly Door face each other, yin and yang stand in alignment, and the day of birth accords with the direct governance of the year. When the day of *wu* again aligns with the year’s birth, this marks a person of great virtue, unobstructed in all things—rightly should one not be alarmed. The terrestrial soil produces the worthy to serve, and the earthly treasury becomes their dwelling. What evil could there be? People, not understanding, take earth as mere humanity, yet all belong to the earthly treasury. Lifespans have their terms: those aligned with sages attain sagacity, those aligned with the worthy attain worthiness—this is the constant law of Heaven, and one’s allotted fortune follows accordingly. Some may even emerge as immortals.

In the years of *yin* and *shen*, such persons resemble tigers. The sun and moon stand in direct alignment, yet they cannot be compared. The reason lies in *yin* being the domain of literary refinement, the region of wood, where mountain forests and fierce beasts are naturally uncontrollable. One should only maintain purity and cleanliness; Heaven sends forth the hunt, but one should not appear frequently, for many will fear them, and they shall be named tigers. Those born in the midst of *yin* shall also have long lives, and if three *yin* converge at birth, longevity may be enduring. *Shen*, however, is its opposition, utterly irreconcilable, filled with dread of the night. Though they may climb trees up and down, their fears are manifold. Their fate lies in metal, and their conduct harms and wounds others. Thus, their lifespans are short—this is readily known. Neglecting the spirits and indulging in dissipation, they are beset by malevolent influences and constant dread, with few favorable moments.

Those born in *mao* or *you* each govern their respective months, and their months are again the same. *Mao* presides over the East, its fate bound to the Eastern Star, where livelihood flourishes and the people are nourished. *Mao* thus signifies the East, with the true *mao* as its center. In spring, it blossoms in splendor; in summer, it bears fruit—nothing is not bestowed, and none are untouched by its virtue. Thus, the Eastern Star is named Benevolence, incapable of harming the center. Heaven cherishes human years and grants extended longevity. *You*, however, stands in the domain of metal, delighting in warfare and strife, and cannot endure long. Evil conduct arises naturally—how could long life follow? Though one may encounter the kingly and ministerial phases of the months, it is but a fleeting semblance. Of six or seven evils, half the days shall perish—this is readily known.

Those born in the years of *si* and *hai* each occupy their respective months, their names again reflecting their nature. With double yin and no yang, their lifespans are naturally short. When the three yin converge, the time again aligns, and thus *si* and *hai* are said to govern the opening and storing. *Hai* presides over the Northwest, *si* over the Southeast; whatever they face or undertake rarely accords with propriety. Their livelihood is difficult to advance, and their lifespans are hard to extend. Thus, the ten celestial stems circulate in mutual correspondence, their names denoting achievement, and the celestial reckoning again aligns. Calculating their short and long spans, one infers fate by mutual correspondence—how could Heaven’s movements be followed at will? Thus, those of great virtue now oversee these patterns, their registers bound to the stellar lodges, their fates recorded in the celestial bureaus. Inner and outer ledgers exist, and the eight directions all possess their own patterns—how could one act at will? People, not grasping these calculations, instead ask what they have done to wrong Heaven. By doing good, one may fulfill one’s allotted years; by doing evil, one forfeits longevity and shortens one’s span. If evil is not ceased, calamity extends even to the unborn—what can one hope for? One reaps what one sows. If one’s fate is meager and its reckoning unfulfilled, the surplus remains in Heaven to be bestowed upon the virtuous. One should admonish one’s descendants to be cautious. By rectifying one’s errors and repenting, one may yet complete one’s years—each shall be clearly apportioned. Reckon one’s conduct and do not resent the celestial spirits. Strive to do good, and one’s descendants shall enjoy extended years; otherwise, one remains as one is—blame not Heaven.

If one initially rectifies oneself but later wavers, one should restore equilibrium. The virtuous and benevolent naturally esteem their years.

**Register of Longevity, First Scroll, Section 182**
The conduct of the Most High’s virtuous ones begins with foreknowledge of Heaven and Earth’s inner and outer workings, their ingress and egress through yin and yang. They grasp the Dao’s guiding principles, arouse the thoughts within, and never forget its principles. Proceeding in accord with Heaven, they dare not doubt, and thus achieve completion, upholding Heaven’s great bestowals. Their thoughts reside within, their conduct free of transgression or fault. Subtly endowed by nature, they repeatedly receive warnings—past and future are known. If people transgress of their own accord, they have no one to blame.

Since ancient times, few have been trustworthy. Those who seek to deceive do not consider the consequences. Thus, Heaven and Earth grow dark with unceasing wrath, and even the wise and sagely know regret. Heaven instructs and teaches them. Yet they reject others’ words, return evil with enmity, and ignore admonitions, seeking only their own way. Such people are more ignorant than beasts. For this reason, they reproach themselves for their faults—how could ease arise? Day and night, they ponder others, never ceasing in their remorse for their transgressions—whom can they blame? Yet they remain unrepentant, reckless in their misconduct, acting without regard for great teachings, and thus bring short lives upon themselves—whom can they blame?

**Reflections on the Origins**
How did the immortals of high antiquity who transcended the world begin their thoughts? Examining the records, all speak of loyalty and filial piety, reverence for parents, harmony among siblings, absence of duplicity, unity above and below, and awareness of Heaven’s prohibitions. The spirits preside over governance; one confesses one’s faults without ceasing, cultivates oneself through introspection, and thus attains life. One’s allotted span has its term—how could one act at will? The thought pains the heart, tears soak the garments, and there is no respite.

Daily they cherish their years and lives, fearing they may not attain longevity. Observing those of long life, they inquire of them, and are told: "They possess loyalty and filial piety, never losing the intent of Heaven and Earth, aiding the four seasons in their generation, assisting the Five Phases in their completion, and daring not to destroy the creatures of the living world. They cease from doing good yet refrain from encroaching upon others, commit no deceit or betrayal, and maintain sincerity and trust without daring to incur debt. Their conduct wins the favor of the multitude, and they dare not fail their kin or bring harm to their village; when they go forth, they always repay what is due. They return in due season and have never lain drunk in the marketplace. The wise and worthy accompany them, while they pay no heed to fools. They hold gratitude toward Heaven and Earth yet dare not expect repayment, only reproaching themselves. If they commit transgressions again, they bear the burden of their faults, reproaching themselves for a set number of years until moved to remorse. The worldly multitude bears many faults and debts, yet remains utterly without resolution. They proceed in sorrow and bitterness, not knowing where to halt. Whenever they see others commit faults, they turn to reproach themselves, unable to find peace, yearning to behold the scriptures of righteousness and the precepts of goodness. By some stroke of fortune, they encounter the great divine precepts of Heaven, pondering them again and again, their thoughts consumed without respite. They knock their heads, beat their breasts, and weep aloud, their bodies unable to correct themselves, yet they multiply their resentments. The weight of the prohibitive scriptures is great, yet they transgress them, shortening their lives and repenting day and night. Hoping for a brief reprieve, they dare not commit further evil, instead resolving to practice kindness and bestow alms. If they grasp the principle, they utter no harsh words, only tears, their hearts stricken with sorrow. The heavenly spirits hear and descend to ask: 'Who is this person, so full of grief and distress?' They observe one of great virtue whose life is long and enduring. Inquiring further, they are told: 'This one merely acts in accord with Heaven’s intent and Earth’s will—thus they attain longevity.' Returning to their quiet abode, they reflect upon this as the words of one of supreme virtue, and thus examine themselves. When the spirits see their self-reproach and repentance, they ascend to report to the Dao of Heaven, saying: 'There is one who weeps and laments in repentance without cease, fearing they may not live, and thus reproaches themselves.' The great spirits hear and say: 'The Heavenly Lord constantly instructs the spirits that those who perform good deeds and act with loyalty and filial obedience are to be advanced—this person alone is such a one.' They then report to the Heavenly Lord. The Heavenly Lord says: 'I have heard that this person has reproached themselves for their faults for many years. Originally but a worldly person, they have ceaselessly reproached their transgressions and become one of supreme goodness. The great spirits have frequently gone to observe them, discerning their conduct and whether they harbor good intentions. If they wish to advance, their lifespan shall temporarily be recorded in the Bureau of Longevity, where their deeds may be observed to make up for their deficiencies.' The great spirits say: 'This person has reproached themselves for so long that their burdens of fault have been absolved. I request that their deficiencies be made up, and they be named one of supreme goodness, to repay those below who have fallen short.' The Heavenly Lord says: 'The conduct of one of supreme goodness must accord with these words. The great spirits shall frequently instruct and protect them, guiding them to ascend as spirits, ensuring their allotted years are not diminished.' The great spirits say: 'Originally, this person had no record in the registers. Having received the decree to be placed in the Bureau of Longevity, I request that their deficiencies be made up in order, without exceeding the proper sequence.' The Heavenly Lord says: 'On the day their deficiencies are made up in order, frequently record their name without missing the appointed time.' The great spirits assent.

Only those of supreme benevolence accumulate merit and deeds in Heaven. Heaven then heeds and trusts them, allowing them to assist the Eastern August One in arranging the creatures of the living world, providing flowers and fruits to nourish the people, ensuring warmth and fullness. Their forms grow large, and they nurture one another in turn. Yin and Yang unite, male and female take shape, the old and young follow in succession, receiving their allotted spans from the reckoning of Heaven. Among the twenty-eight lunar lodges, they revolve and complete one another; the sun and moon illuminate and inspect without fail, taking turns to generate life—how could there be respite? Yet people do not know this, believing each to be self-governing. Though they bear names as if self-governing, they in fact check and sustain one another. The reason for this is that human lives have varying lengths, and the seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer bring constant cycles of life and death. Thus, they are made to govern one another, transferring and inquiring in turn. Lifespans increase or decrease, passing from one to another. Therefore, it is said that the four seasons, Five Phases, sun, moon, and stars all hold sway over life. The good have their years increased, while the evil retreat on their own. The reckoning of faults, great or small, follows a constant law. If one acts in accordance with this law, how could there be escape? Above in Heaven and below on Earth, they correspond like the exterior and interior, with various spirits also dispatched to assist one another. Thus, it is said that the Heavenly Lord issues decrees to the various bureaus, each transferring and taking turns to serve as the current tally, without the slightest partiality. From above, they observe below—how could there be error?

Those of inherent nature harbor no evil intent. Though they may commit minor faults, they repent of their deeds, and their transgressions are absolved. Their names are regularly entered into the registers. The evil are consigned to the lower bureaus, while the good are reported as good, and the evil as evil. The spirits of fortune and misfortune each follow where they are assigned. If the evil repent, their names are transferred to the good bureaus. If the good turn to evil, they are moved to the evil bureaus—how could there be respite? Among the living in the world, even those still in the womb, whose names and fates are recorded in the Register of the Undying, once their years are fulfilled and their conduct complete, are taken up by those who record the living, and only when they have a guarantor are they entered into the registers. The reason for this is that their lives are difficult to await and weighty, so their guarantors are held jointly responsible. Thus, those who are disloyal, unfilial, disobedient, and without merit have no guarantors, existing only to continue the ancestral sacrifices of their forebears. If they persist in evil without cease, how could they obtain sustenance in future lives? How could those who feed on filth ever be fit to serve the great spirits of Heaven for long? Even among those in filth, there are those who respond to the scriptures of Heaven, and Heaven dispatches spirits to instruct them. When the appointed time arrives, the Heavenly Lord commands the guardian spirits of the Great Heavenly Granary to sever their attachment to material forms. They receive the qi of the Great Heavenly Granary, their food dissolving and transforming, making their spirits light and ethereal. They emerge from darkness into the unseen, and their names ascend, no longer recorded in the registers."

How could one seek life, and how could others know of it? When a person cultivates goodness without losing the heart of Heaven, the great spirits stir their mind, making them delight in life—whether Daoist or layperson, they cling to it themselves. The reason for this is that when one commits evil without a single good deed, merely coveting fine clothes and carriages, following their own desires without restraint, even Heaven and Earth do not deny their fleeting wishes. Yet the wicked cannot long behold the sun, moon, and stars of Heaven. They must return to the eternal night—how could they remain long? Those who cannot take themselves as teachers to cultivate goodness are known by Heaven to persist in evil, and so they are made to consume material sustenance. Thus, they are buried beneath the earth, becoming servants of the earth spirits, never to be reborn. This is why scriptures are shown to them, that they may know.

Some undergo *shijie* (corpse liberation), their forms dissolving, bones and body parting. Though the corpse remains in one place, the spirit becomes a wandering soul, seen by others who declare them dead. Yet those who know may still perceive them alive—such are the *shijie* immortals. Over time, as their years and merits accumulate, they ascend in broad daylight to Heaven. When their merits and years are complete, their radiance shines anew, aiding the celestial spirits in their all-pervading work. They return to dwell among the clouds, and within their domains, all *shijie* immortals oversee the affairs of humans and ghosts.

In families of the Dao, those who depart may be enfeoffed as honored spirits among the dead, known as *Dilingqi* (Earthly Numinous Spirits), and may wear the purple, mugwort, blue, and yellow insignia. Their authority has ranks, and their ascent has limits. If their evil deeds are heard even in part, they are demoted to join the ranks of ghosts—do you understand? Thus it is said: the paths of life and death diverge, how could they be compared?

Proceed, and when minor lapses or lingering attachments remain, they shall be addressed later.

〈Rising〉
Only the virtuous conduct of the Most High’s good people manifests the affairs Heaven and Earth must enact. Each has its master, each its discourse, each its cultivation, each its spiritual attainment, each its merit, each its loyalty, each its governance, each its bestowal upon others, each its path of advancement. Each aligns with the heart of Heaven and Earth, never losing the generative and transformative cycles of the four seasons and five phases. Thus, those who respond to the Most High’s virtuous are Heaven’s trust and Earth’s safeguard, all attaining the harmonious heart of the center. They understand the ebb and flow of human affairs, carrying out commands without daring to contravene the will of the great sages, nor transgress the prohibitions of the myriad spirits. Ever mindful of perfecting others, they make them delight in goodness.

They secure the hearts of Heaven and Earth, establishing inner truth from outward signs, achieving success in their persons, and attaining longevity, inscribed in the register of the undying. They serve alongside the great spirits in corresponding roles, discerning right from wrong, loyal and sincere to Heaven. They behold the sun, moon, and stars without losing the measure, nor their resolve. Ever desiring to live, they contemplate serving Heaven’s transformation, 〈halt〉 and again understand Earth’s principles. Their hearts rejoice, for they know the records of fortune and misfortune, the affairs of survival and demise, and aspire to walk the same path as the natural order.

Even slight greed or evil is seen by the great spirits’ admonitions. Moved by pity for the unknowing, they illuminate their shortcomings, guiding them to the register of long life, where they witness the Heavenly Lord bestowing life upon the ignorant, remaining long in the register of the undying. They perform the affairs of Heaven above and communicate with Earth’s principles below. What they see and hear is clear: their eyes bright, ears keen, they perceive the boundless affairs of past and future. Their writings and words are fluent, and they comprehend the essential and wondrous—such are the aspirations of the Most High’s good people.

Only the great celestial spirits perceive and fulfill their wishes, yearning for the natural, their conduct in harmony with the qi of life, endless and without limit. It is ever said: 〈rising〉 Heaven does not deny a person’s wishes, Earth does not deny a person’s peace—this is the natural order. They dare not have even a hair’s entanglement, nor trouble the spirits with deep records in ink. Day and night, they reflect on their faults and debts, fearing they may fail to meet the expectations of the Most High Lord. What do they惜惜 or love, that they would not exhaust their loyalty and filial piety?

They should declare themselves recipients of grace and favor, enjoying glory, yet seeking no repayment. Heaven’s heart cherishes them deeply, yet they reproach themselves for their faults, granting little pardon. 〈Halt〉 Only the great spirits may forgive and admonish them, but they must not cling to longing nor dare to distance themselves. Ever mindful of unrepayed kindness, their sins cling to their bodies, and they fear no words can absolve them—only sorrow remains. Though they see forgiveness and reflection, they are made to ponder their debts.

The great spirits say: "The Most High’s good people reflect on their faults and reproach themselves; their words and writings reach the highest ears. Their words extend far, yet they fear their meaning may not be understood. Heaven’s trust especially honors them, and they may attain boundless longevity. They should ever set their hearts afar, never forgetting the great gifts bestowed by Heaven’s life. The Most High Lord praises them, saying: 'Life arises from the mandate of life itself. They disregard wealth and beauty, ever desiring to share long life with those they save. When would they act recklessly or without heart, failing to repay such profound kindness?'"

"Yet they惜惜 their years since birth, for they have not seen the great measure."

Only by receiving the grace of instruction and admonition do they come to know their allotted principles. They should speak of knowing fate, neither resenting Heaven nor daring to reproach themselves and thus hinder their own lives. With hearts thus aligned, when would they ever be greedy or perverse? Yet they fear only that their years and fate may reach their end without witnessing Heaven’s great dispensation of life’s allotments.

Once more, they admonish and instruct the ignorant and benighted, granting them the boon of reflection and foresight—a kindness beyond repayment in mere words. They but restrain their hearts and keep their thoughts within, never forgetting hunger and thirst, seeking precepts to preserve life, and only by receiving pardon and reflection.

The great spirits say: "We originally advanced to the Heavenly Lord from among the spirits without the slightest fault, aiding Heaven and Earth with meritorious counsel. Our names are recorded in the Heavenly Lord’s register—how could we ever be forgotten? We request to present the words of the living who reproach themselves, whose years are numbered yet who covet Heaven’s transformation. Are such people recorded in the celestial registers?"

The Heavenly Lord says: "Those who reproach themselves act in accord with nature; they are also aided by the spirits’ goodness."

"Let those who oversee the celestial records examine them. If they find self-reproach, the spirit in charge of the living’s register shall be commanded to inspect the documents. Such a person is indeed recorded in the registers."

The Heavenly Lord says: "Those who live and act with goodness, transgressing no prohibitions, achieve this through their own conduct."

The great spirits add: "Let us examine further. We must ensure that those who act lack no names in the upper registers."

The great spirits say: "Since the Great Beginning, spirits who have gained Heaven’s favor through merit have been advanced, though some vacancies remain. Those whose conduct is fitting should have their names duly recorded above."

The Heavenly Lord says: "The duties of our offices are many and onerous. Calculate their merits, absolve their faults, and ensure they never violate what has been decreed."

The great spirits say: "These Most High people follow the correct path, and their faults and debts are few."

The Heavenly Lord says: "Reflect further. If any are unworthy of promotion, hold them accountable to fill the vacancies with trustworthy candidates."

The Heavenly Lord says: "Such matters must not be treated carelessly."

The great spirits say: "As the words have stated, before a hundred days have passed, the spirits above will vie to vouch for them. We, the great spirits, present this intent."

The Heavenly Lord says: "Let each be assigned as is fitting. Send them to attend to their duties, and they shall be further esteemed. Those who are trustworthy shall be appointed as Perfected."

The great spirits say: "We request to dispatch spirit-messengers to summon them above, first transforming their forms."

The spirit-messengers go forth, their transformations complete, radiant with abundant luminous essence.

The great spirits report back. The Heavenly Lord says: "The person has transformed into a spirit and now waits outside the gate, not yet having entered."

The Heavenly Lord commands that they be presented to the overseers’ office for an audience.

The great spirits say: "We have reported as requested."

"Very well. Let the report be as stated, and we shall observe their conduct accordingly."

The Heavenly Lord says: "Let it be as the great spirits have reported."

**Chapter 183: The Longing of the Knowing to Meet the Great Spirits**

Only those of the Most High who possess knowledge may foreknow the affairs of Heaven, discerning what is to be done and what is to be upheld. Their affairs arise naturally, the primordial qi converging to bring them to fruition, clearly and knowably. Transforming their hearts, they become natural in their conduct. Thus, the knowing understand both surface and depth, their comings and goings, their actions—nothing fails to reach completion, nothing fails to attain its proper place, and nothing fails to transform in due time. Revering the majesty of the spirits, they perfect their merit and name their virtue. Ever unwavering in loyalty and trust, never remiss, day and night they grieve and tremble, their thoughts never leaving their hearts. Inclining and yearning, they long to achieve an audience with the great spirits. Through discourse and the exchange of words, they follow the Way they know and advance what they have understood.

Ever contemplating success, they seek to repay the spirits’ kindness, to extend their years and increase their lifespan. Thus, the knowing look inward to see outward—what do they not know? What do they not perceive? Their hearts are clear and attentive. They but covet the Dao of long life, desiring to ride as envoys for the great spirits. Wherever they go, they dare not speak falsely, responding in the moment as if already arrived, longing for their hearts to open. Receiving the spirits’ words as the spirits themselves would, knowing the spirits’ actions, they proceed with self-assurance, then dare to speak, seeking only to be granted life. They dare not seek high office, only to be shown mercy. Though they witness matters of life and death, their hearts tremble with fear. Having received great instruction, they must act to communicate it, bestowing kindness and spreading beneficence, benefiting those above and those below, inscribing their names in the registers, ever abiding in the position of the undying. Their hearts rejoice and delight, dedicating their merit to the Heavenly Lord, accumulating it over the years before speaking further. Only by the great spirits’ grace are their insufficiencies made known. Knowing their words are grand, they thus covet advancement, receiving their secret decrees, anxiously awaiting the convergence of gates, never daring to rest. They long for instruction and admonition, to be granted what they lack. They wish to be examined and not contradict what is said, awaiting the great spirits’ commands.

Those of the Most High who possess knowledge see much, yet they cannot fully know Heaven’s domains—what, then, should they be admonished about? The spirits of Heaven all perceive them. The words of the Most High who possess knowledge are but to know what is said, what is followed, what is done—what doubt could there be?

The Heavenly Lord says: "Ever command the spirits to advance the names of those who are loyal, filial, sincere, trustworthy, and meritorious. These are the Most High who possess knowledge, whose allotted blessings they covet, and thus they clarify their hearts. Yet they fear their words and writings are but self-expression—why would they withhold reverence for Heaven’s instruction and admonition? They often say they suffer from having no one to record their words, fearing that inner and outer may not correspond. If they wish to advance their reflections and broaden their inquiries to deep understanding, this too is what they should know. Proceed, and heed the words of the great spirits. Heaven’s admonitions are weighty—one must be cautious, reverent, and awestruck, then one may proceed."

The admonitions are many, yet one must grasp their essence—open your ears, eyes, and heart to them." "Indeed, indeed."

Yet when emerging from this, the great celestial precepts of Heaven decree that all who seek advancement and long life must present what they know. To possess knowledge and remain silent, as if merely listening, is to lack the heart for self-advancement. When the mind holds understanding and reflection, one must advance and reveal it. If there is aspiration within, present that aspiration; if there is sincerity, present that sincerity; if there is filial piety, present that filial piety. Only thus may one become Heaven’s confidant—nothing must be withheld.

The Heavenly Lord foresees human nature: one must not fail to advance, nor withhold the Dao and its teachings. To conceal knowledge and hide one’s abilities—Heaven despises such a person, ensuring they do not appear in the Register of Longevity. Is this not so? Not only will they vanish from the Register of Longevity, but their primordial essence will dissipate, departing from the body, and their years will be lost. Can one not be cautious?

The reason the Most High possess knowledge is that the Heavenly Lord discerns the knowing from the unknowing—this they know themselves. What doubt remains? One need only reflect deeply on the words of the spirits and not betray them.

The words of the Most High who possess knowledge say: even the ignorant below, when earnestly inquiring, seek to grasp what they do not know. How dare they conceal knowledge or hide their abilities, causing the Heavenly Lord and the spirits to learn of it, leading to the loss of life and years, and a lifespan cut short? This is the root of calamity and misfortune—even the destruction of the body would not suffice to repay it. How could one dare to advance yet still withhold?

The great spirits say: "Those who seek life and shun death must also possess resolve and will—lest they falter in confusion."

The disciple says: "I myself do not know the precepts, yet by the grace of the great spirits, I have been taught thus. How dare I grow complacent and not advance what I know and say? I only hope the great spirits will record it."

The great spirits say: "To be recorded is not easy. Only those who are preserved and trusted, who align with the Heavenly Lord’s will, may hope for life. Take heed of this."

The disciple says: "I truly crave life, and so I exhaust my loyalty and sincerity, never daring to slacken. I reflect on my faults and reproach myself—how dare I waste day and night?"

The Heavenly Lord, having heard this, says: "These are the words of one who is among the Most High who possess knowledge. It is known that in the celestial records, this person’s name appears, though incomplete. Command the spirit of the Register of Life to verify: though this person’s name is recorded, and though they are virtuous and knowledgeable, their years must be fulfilled—do not let the spirit of their allotted time be lost."

"Indeed, indeed."

**Method for the Person of Heart to Accumulate Deeds and Mend the True: Scroll One Hundred Eighty-Four**

**〈Commencement〉**
Only the Most High’s person of heart knows their allotted portion, each having their own Dao, their own conduct, their own devotion, their own advancement, their own declaration, their own speech, their own attainment, their own movement. The heart is not bound within; they constantly think of exhausting loyalty, trustworthiness, and filial piety. Sincerely meritorious before Heaven, they accumulate deeds over the years, never once slackening. Though they forget gratitude and duty, they constantly long for life, gaining the protection of the host of upper spirits, never daring to offer even the slightest portion. They constantly harbor a fearful heart, never at ease, desiring the Most High’s precepts to preserve their life—how dare they forget the great dispensation?

Only the great spirits may glance upon what they overlook. Their heart constantly yearns for the affairs of the Most High, for what they must uphold, the compass and square, the plumb line and inked cord. Trust arises naturally; they survey the four boundaries, fathom the four corners. What Heaven knows, they manifest before it comes to pass. Their heart contemplates the petitions and memorials of the great spirits, what they advance and declare—never daring to judge by their own intent. They constantly consult with the assembled spirits, whether to accept or reject, ever fearful of failing to win the hearts of the gods.

**〈Conclusion〉**
They reflect: "I am one of unblemished origin." As if arising from the very center of their being, they long for the life that harms nothing, coveting its radiance. Above, it reaches the sound without essence or form; penetratingly, it fulfills the Most High’s commands. Never daring to slacken and obstruct the great transformation, they beseech the spirits to examine their longing for life, never daring to stray from the left side of the great spirits. Upon seeing the precepts, their heart opens and their eyes brighten, desiring to abide in the scripture of longevity, to increase their years and lifespan. They aspire to advance in merit, personally attending to it, never daring to trust themselves, to arrogate the Dao’s twists and turns, or to contend over what is insufficient.

They gaze upward, ever urgent, only hoping for the compassionate illumination of the precepts. When will their gratitude and love cease? Their heart longs day and night for reunion, coveting knowledge of prohibitions and transgressions to stir their resolve, so they may see what they have yet to attain. These are not matters to be repaid in words or speech; only by receiving scrutiny does the thought pierce their heart and diaphragm.

The great spirit says: "This is the conduct proper to the Most High’s person of heart. They seek to receive Heaven’s weighty precepts and prohibitions. Those who are inherently wise and clear-sighted discern principle—what need have they for precepts? Holding the heart, they aim at the heart; no private bias intervenes. From above, they observe below, knowing full well what they serve.

Now, the Most High’s person of heart is Heaven’s intimate, trusted by the celestial spirits. They need only hold fast to their intent, ever fearful of loss. The rest is known to their own heart. Strive to transmit and widely inquire; do not lose what is spoken."

"The wise discern much, but I fear they may not always live up to their words. Why hesitate to speak plainly? Such a person’s heart reflects on their own faults and debts. Simply contemplate before and after—longevity will naturally arise from within, resonating with the Heavenly Lord’s will.

I have little to admonish the person of heart. Their life began as one of the rustic and lowly. Witnessing long life and old transformations, they again encounter the prime of light and radiance. Essence flows in and out without loss; no failure is seen. Though many study, few attain—none, in fact. Why is this? Their heart is not sufficiently steadfast, and they treat their words lightly. Their allotted record is not fitting, hence their rarity.

Now, seeing the deeds of those who came before, they further correct and amend their conduct, opening their heart to retain what is good. Desiring to raise their voice, they listen well, coveting longevity and cherishing their years. Thus, they never dare to slacken, only beseeching the great spirits to examine what they overlook."

The great spirit says: "The person of heart shall be granted registration in the celestial records. Let the clerks of the registers be summoned to verify: those whose names are recorded shall be reported to the Heavenly Lord. The great spirits may not act on their own."

The person of life says: "Only the great spirits may illuminate and deliberate. I dare not distance myself, lingering outside. I will personally prove my worth."

The great spirit says: "Let the person of heart be reported. Those whose names are recorded in the registers—why hesitate to respond?"

The person of life says: "Only the great spirits may speak on my behalf. On the day of accomplishment, I will devote my life to proving myself. What need have I for repayment?"

The great spirit reports to the Heavenly Lord: "The Most High’s person of heart all hold their hearts steadfast and secret, their aspiration constantly longing for the upper realms with trust. Command the overseeing spirits to examine them. If such a person exists, advance and report to the great spirits. Command the overseers to verify: if this person’s name appears in the records, they were preordained before birth."

The great spirit returns and reports: "This person was registered before birth—only by the grace of the Most High."

The Heavenly Lord says: "Those recorded in the registers shall be seen to ascend. They shall take responsibility for their debts and burdens. The great spirits shall dispatch a divine envoy to remove their burden of debt, transform their heart, and refine them into a spirit. When their years are fulfilled, they shall advance upward."

The great spirit says: "This person’s years and allotment are complete, their reckoning exceeding the term by nearly a hundred days. Previously, there was no fixed date, so they were temporarily halted."

The Heavenly Lord says: "Command the great spirits to advance them, placing them in an interim office. Let them fill a vacancy among the true. If they can exhaust their essence and will, knowing how to remove and concurrently act, then—"

The great spirit says: "Let them advance as the Heavenly Lord commands. Reassess their essence, lifespan, and reckoning. The enlightened shall ascend in broad daylight."

The Heavenly Lord says: "This is fitting for the person of heart, desiring to give them a position."

The great spirits assent. Let the proper officials be commanded to carry out the original decree.

The great spirit says: "Report to the Bureau of Ascension."

The petitioner reports to the great spirit: "Command the overseeing clerks."

The overseers having reported: "Let them be assigned to an interim office, filling a vacancy among the true."

The Heavenly Lord says: "As the clerks have reported."

*On the Disasters of Greed for Wealth and Lust, and the Admonitions Within the Womb (185)*

In ancient times, the formless divine beings sought the Dao of life. They aligned their aspirations with the qi of the Primordial, constantly yearning for long life, ever mindful never to betray the intent of that qi. At dusk they settled their thoughts, at dawn they attended to their duties, clinging tenaciously to life without a moment’s forgetfulness. They often reflected and observed, offering utmost loyalty and sincerity, following and fulfilling the wishes of the Primordial qi. Thus, their conduct ascended in clarity, resplendent and audible throughout the four directions—perceiving even unseen things and faint sounds, moving above and below, all in accordance with the proper measures. The host of spirits and refined qi came unbidden to serve and attend them, fearing to displease or offend, all filled with reverent awe. Their garments and footwear transformed to suit their desires; they bestowed kindness and spread grace, their fame flowing above and below, reaching the eight directions beyond the six extremes, extending even to the sages of old. Each received rewards or punishments according to their virtues and faults. Those covered by great mercy reverently obeyed the commands, moving even the stars to respond.

---

Boundless were their resources, boundless their virtue. They selected the steadfast and good to shield and conceal themselves. Their wishes were fulfilled, their hearts at ease and joyful, attaining life without limit. Serene and unadorned, they cherished the wholeness of their bodies—how could they grow weary? Others did not know them, nor did they heed others. Without rank or merit, how could they ascend to share the same path as the Primordial qi? Thus, they treasured, loved, and nurtured themselves, and in their utmost youth, they practiced boundless generosity—how could they fail to receive blessings?

Yet they pondered: moving within the harmony of Heaven and Earth, they illuminated the sun, moon, and stars, drawing light from before them. The twenty-eight constellations took their turns, observing the people’s use of the heavenly stems and earthly branches, the patterns of fortune and misfortune. But people knew little of this, considering themselves wise. Their actions and movements brought no benefit to Heaven, and in violating prohibitions, they invited calamity—extending even to the annihilation of their families, the severing of their lineage, and the loss of their ancestors’ sacrifices. How could their lives remain whole for long? What could be done for such people?

They did not follow the ancient texts, believing themselves free from offense against spirits and gods. Yet the three qi were not in harmony, and fate had its thickness and thinness. Unable to deeply contemplate disasters and misfortunes, the three qi spirits were sent to admonish them. Those who heeded the warnings prospered; those who did not doomed themselves to the depths below, their misfortunes flowing to their descendants. Heaven’s decrees were not obeyed; evil was practiced and good abandoned—how could they endure? What the August Emperor did not wish to see was swiftly cut short in years. Yet people, unaware, blamed the Azure Heaven. When did Heaven ever wrong them? They brought it upon themselves. Utterly lacking wisdom and foresight, their lives were like those of dogs and sheep—how could they long endure? Caught in the same snares as birds, they violated the celestial net, their greed for food harming their bodies. Their kind followed one another, heedless of their years. Only the wise escaped to the unharmed lands beyond the four borders—how did they alone fare thus? It was simply the natural course of their fate. Though dwelling among the uninhabited, their lives were preserved by fate. Few in the world repaid them—such was the way of the times. Alas, what could be done?

They asked, "What have we done to wrong Heaven?" Among the ancients, not one in ten thousand matched their kind. Greedy for wealth and lust, they disregarded impending peril. Disasters reached even the womb, leaving them unseen by the sun, moon, or stars—how could they not grieve? They brought ruin upon themselves, their fate bound to the earth. Wretched were these people, yet they had their counterparts—even plants, trees, birds, and beasts were the same. They did not strive to correct themselves or purify their intentions, uttering reckless and evil words. Above, the spirits recorded their deeds; below, no numinous response remained. Nothing was hidden from the one who presided over them. Each must exert themselves to seek the admonitions of the divine spirits, the convergence of fortune and misfortune—how could there be no reckoning?

Thus, the divine beings were commanded to establish prohibitions for the people, allowing them to see the taboos of life and death. Those touched by yang qi were recorded in the registers of true immortals; those with transgressions were demoted. Those touched by yin qi were placed among the dead. Reflect deeply and consider carefully—do not lose the celestial net that extends to the patterns of the earth. Know the human condition, the inner and outer, when to advance and when to retreat. Do not bring blame upon others, and each may gain extended years, their blessings extending to their descendants.

After receiving the admonitions, be doubly cautious in speech. Evil committed below is not overlooked above. The people of the vulgar world lack filial piety and loyalty, coveting what they desire and seizing what is not theirs. Their hearts brim with murderous intent, never leaving their lips—how could they hope to live? Calamity and blame would come, sooner or later. Follow the records of the celestial texts and divine spirits, keeping far from what should be avoided. Do not test fate—testing life brings life, testing death brings death. When death comes, there is no doubt.

Thus, I reiterate and repeat: do not associate with the ignorant, nor utter even slight dissent. The Dao of long life lies close at hand in the three spirits; the three qi combine to form a person. If they do not combine, they scatter into earth, becoming like tiles and stones, shattered in unseen places, unable to compare with the whole and intact. The spirits of the three destinies reside near the heart—what is there to cherish or love? Yet they cling to the ruin of their forms, displayed in the marketplace for all to see—when will they return to life? Their parents grieve, their wives and children suffer. Distant kin rejoice, neighbors resent their belated demise, and death flows to later generations.

Those who correct themselves and do good may yet regain longevity. Sincerity moves all things to their natural state. Be vigilant within and without, between yin and yang, in the four seasons’ generation and completion—do not destroy them. Between Heaven above, Earth below, and the harmony between them, all have their masters. For those with understanding, these are the methods of mutual response. Those who live align their wishes with the Dao of Heaven; those who do evil cut short their years. How could they not be cautious?

The words of the divine beings all receive Heaven’s response—they cannot blame themselves. Those who extend their lifespan by doing good may fulfill their natural years; the wicked descend into the Yellow Springs. Ponder this, ponder it well, and do not transmit it recklessly. When the wicked receive evil, they suffer its calamities, their deaths and lives separated in different realms, none daring to speak of it. If one does not act with goodness, they must not resent others; there are always those who record such deeds, leaving no room for further complaint. Study the texts to grasp their meaning, be vigilant with sacred scriptures, for spirits and spectral agents all have their causes.

Those of destined households who encounter this text must take care not to harm themselves or deceive the good. When Heaven shortens a person’s life, bringing illness and disease, there is no need to seek aid from physicians or tormented shamans—their records will be severed, what doubt remains? Reflect deeply, contemplate, and consider: one may yet avoid calamity. But once misfortune strikes, there is no salvation. The Perfected One holds this text to enlighten the ignorant, that they may reform and do good, not malign its words. What has been said before is repeated here. The reason is this: life and death alter fate, and without speaking of its prohibitions, there is no way to preserve it—□□ is natural.

One must only know the true intent of the heart and favor these words, understanding their meaning. Thus, guard the unity of the body to fulfill one’s natural years; guard unity, reflect on transgressions, and one may yet extend their term. The Dao of Heaven is boundless, yet few attain its truth. The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are abandoned by many. The reason is this: those who do not believe in their texts rarely achieve transcendence, becoming instead common folk. Now, through the masters of the Three Divine Beings, those whose hearts are moved anew—when divine spirits attach to a person, they do not wish for earthly qi to summon them. Thus, one must carefully ponder and consider its intent, not doubting this text.

The masters of the divine beings, having received Heaven’s teachings, transmit it to those who record and comprehend its meaning.

**Admonition of the Seventy-Two Kinds of Corpse Deaths, One Hundred Eighty-Sixth**
*(Beginning)*
Heaven has its four corners, Earth has its four corners, thus the sun and moon pass their light in succession. The stars have their degrees, illuminating right and wrong. People have their nobility and baseness, lifespans their length and brevity, each endowed with the destiny of the Six Jia. Birth comes early or late, emoluments align with duty, good and evil dwell in separate places, not losing even a fraction. Common folk do not understand, claiming there is no truth—only when harmonized with divine spirits may one be called human. Only with the divine spirit as one’s heart may one become a lord of men.

Times and seasons have their responses, divisions lie within their domains. Those who receive Heaven’s response are raised by celestial spirits. Those who receive Earth’s response are nurtured by earthly spirits. Those who receive the response of harmony are protected by human and spectral spirits. Good responses bring good, good naturally elevates itself; evil responses bring evil, evil naturally follows. All have their roots, circulating above and below. The waters of mountains and seas, each with their boundaries, each desiring those of good nature and non-opposition as their people. The spirits of the land also desire good people. Each imposes prohibitions, connecting upward to Heaven. Those who do evil and violate them bring ruin upon themselves.

*(End)*
In households of great evil, none—young or old—are favored by spirits and gods. One may only correct themselves, not slander the divine. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man—prohibitions do not favor the empty good. Even the essence of divine qi can lend itself to humans, while the wicked do not escape their records, which are promptly reported above. When transgressions accumulate, the Great Yin presides over the case, judging by the severity of the law, all recorded in ledgers. People remain unaware, thinking nothing of it. The Bright Hall of the Great Yang, with its many recorded transmissions, is overseen by its own domain’s masters, who also transmit frequently.

When celestial spirits report deaths above, lifespans are reduced, and the mortal world is diminished. One cannot ponder this too deeply—repeated goodness brings goodness, while evil returns to its perpetrator. Even those who govern the heavens know little wisdom, thus they issue these texts on saving lives through good and evil, admonishing past and future. Do not take evil words lightly, nor make them the subject of idle talk. Every action and retreat brings its own misfortune. Thus, this text is presented to you, that you may ponder its meaning and not blame yourself.

The courts enforce the law, yet people violate it themselves—do not resent the enforcers, for resentment shortens the ledger of life. When one is to be executed, the ledgers serve as evidence. Thus, they are buried, and their cases are examined. Documents are cross-referenced—who can escape? Strive to distance yourself from evil, do not make it your companion, and you may yet live out your allotted years. Those who are not loyal in suffering, though struck by madness and malevolence, may yet survive.

The prohibitions and laws of Heaven’s divine spirits are like those of the harmony below the earth, flowing in four directions, all governed by the same pattern—what doubt remains? If a person has merit before Heaven, yet their descendants act wickedly, their allotted years are erased. Though they do not die at once, once their allotment is exhausted, there is no hope for their survival. Lords of states and children of the people must be guided by teaching, directing them toward good and evil, ensuring truth is attained.

Do not cut short the mandate of Heaven and man, severing the generations of the world. Punishment follows its course, and the wise are often seen at its beginning and end. The majesty of the spirits rests upon the lord—do not act with violence. What was said before bears repeating. Lords and fathers may thus extend their years and those of their descendants, flourishing endlessly—take care not to indulge in killing. Though it may seem acceptable at the time, calamity will follow.

*(Beginning)*
Officials, great or small, and their subordinates should clarify their duties and not become a scourge to the people. Those with exceptional ability should revere the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and kindness, aligning with Heaven’s power, Earth’s intent, and the benefit of harmony. Reflect on meeting the good spirits, each having their faith—do not deceive the ignorant.

*(End)*
Those who seek long life and survival must not torment themselves with sorrow and bitterness. Contemplate the affairs of Heaven above, and the spirits will raise you—you may achieve transcendence and long life, ever gazing upon the sun, moon, and stars. This is Heaven’s great mercy. Take care not to commit even minor wrongs, lest you be sent down again.

Those who persist in evil will eventually extinguish their households, thus this repeated admonition: let there be no transgressors. Transgressors are but ill-fated youths. When one intends to do wrong, others should dissuade them from their folly, sparing them from misfortune. Those who disregard counsel will later regret it—such is the fortune of the admonisher.

The stars observe mankind; none may act wickedly. Each must account for their deeds. The virtuous enjoy long life without doubt. Instruct the young to offer sustenance to their ancestors, or else their names shall perish.

*(Beginning)*
Violate not Heaven’s prohibitions, nor Earth’s punishments. Follow the four seasons in harmony, and bear no name of slaughter. The Five Phases form all things; each must guard their place. *(End)* Let no evil name be yours.

Do not slight superiors or inferiors, for all take turns as masters. Ensure no sudden or violent acts, and you shall gain renown. Let thoughts dwell in the heart; guard your form from dissipation. When spirit scatters, malevolent ghosts startle the soul. Reflect to preserve yourself; forget not your name. Each has their joys—pursue the Dao and seek goodness to increase years and prolong life, even achieving immortality.

Be cautious, be ever cautious. Do not pervert justice in punishment. Though it may weary the mind at first, honor shall follow. Masters may be good or evil; consider the root to understand the branch. Disobedient disciples lose their names and cannot attain transcendence. Violating Earth’s punitive spirits only compounds wickedness, barring rebirth.

Be cautious again and again. Within the body, the radiance of spirit arises naturally. Inner and outer become one; actions and words align without losing sincerity. The Five Spirits reside within, knowing your shortfalls. Do not lightly transgress, for there are always records. For minor faults, confess before the Hall of Light. Body and spirit shall be bound, and your deeds examined. Grave offenses incur irrevocable loss; lesser ones reduce your years.

If the spirits do not exonerate you, the fault lies with the person. There are laws and punishments—not only for the living but for spirits and ghosts as well. The ancients, knowing this, dared not transgress. The tally of gods and humans is recorded in Heaven, Earth, and among men. Even without merit, one should not expect reward.

The hearts of the worthy and sagely should reflect upon these scrolls. The scrolls contain prophecies and warnings: the wicked act in rebellion.

*(Beginning)*
Those who cherish life are protected by Heaven; those who nurture life are aided by Earth; those who practice benevolence are beloved by all. To go beyond this is to invite calamity. Heaven knows their evil and dispatches malevolent spirits and spectral beings to await them. These enter the body, flowing outward to the limbs, head, face, abdomen, back, chest, flanks, and the Seven Governors. They ascend to the Hall of Light, manifesting in seventy-two forms—this is the corpse of death.

When the Five Viscera are afflicted, their departure has its time. Be cautious in diet; do not let wind and cold assail you. Follow virtue in all actions, and you shall live out your years. Heaven cherishes human life; Earth cherishes human nurturance; humans cherish human generosity. To do evil is to invite irremediable disaster.

Thus, this celestial scripture admonishes: *(End)* let the people violate no prohibitions. Heaven’s qi issues decrees through men; each should wash away impure conduct.

Be cautious, forget not. Later, there shall be joy. Otherwise, do not presume to remain... as stated. *Inscribing the Scripture: Do Not Needlessly Afflict Yourself with Admonitions*, Scroll One Hundred Eighty-Seven.

*(Beginning)*
The words of the divine sages of old never strayed from the fundamental principles, for they had their own laws and standards. *(End)* The ignorant must each be warned—this warning is especially profound.

The severity of punishment for transgressions arises from human actions, not mere emptiness; there is always a reckoning. Heaven’s nature is spontaneous and cannot be deceived. Reflect deeply without ceasing, and your conduct shall become that of a celestial spirit.

Transformation has its time; do not lose the fundamental principles. The qi of the four seasons must not be violated. When spirit is present, there is no negligence. If one fails to confess, Heaven employs its divining spirits to prevent false reports, and only then may one live. Otherwise, punishment is meted out: selling vegetables in the marketplace, unable to show one’s face, scorned by the base, despised by the multitude. For grave transgressions, the punishment is deep—forty years. Only then may one ascend again as a messenger of the gods. For moderate offenses, thirty years; for lesser, ten.

Their dominion is revoked, each according to their portion. If one changes their heart and self-reproaches, they may endure long. Do not alter Heaven’s words and bring blame upon yourself. Reflect deeply.

For future immortals, weigh the depth of your considerations. Blame lies with yourself; do not resent the words of the gods. In all movements, inner and outer, be cautious of error. Scrutinize what you receive. As a servant of Heaven, you may not act freely. You must immediately obey commands without delay, or face inquiry without delay.

For grave offenses, the messenger is dismissed. Earth records what is received, names inscribed as on a register. No lingering is permitted; where there is a vacancy, a lower-ranked person shall fill it. The reason is this: even those who have fully attained spirit immortality may be demoted—how much more so the foolish scholar? From this point onward, transgress no more.

Heaven punishes human faults, with ghosts and spirits as its agents. Disobeying Heaven’s teachings brings immediate misfortune and blame, not requiring whips or lashes—one reaps what they sow. Those who doubt shall be suspected and cannot remain long. Thus, these words are spoken again: be cautious and vigilant.

Do not imitate the vulgar, who cease their ways with wine and meat. The Dao of immortality is most weighty; thus, it is spoken to men. Those whose fate is to endure are dispatched by the spirits, riding clouds and dragons, traversing all before ceasing.

When Heaven issues commands, they must be carried out. Do not lose the rules or falsify records. Place evidence to the left; do not presume to act on your own. Heaven also rests, and each receives their due punishment. Bear no resentment.

When reported by the spirits, do not recklessly violate the children of Heaven above, Earth below, and the Center in harmony. Each fails to respect themselves. Do not resent Heaven’s blame or Earth’s faults. Above and below detain one another, as in human law. If decrees lack sincerity, the lower ranks grow resentful and do not linger. The gods of Heaven contend for the Dao.

*(Beginning)*
How much more should ordinary people revere and uphold Heaven’s laws, follow Heaven’s harmony, and require no recompense for sustenance or clothing? With merit, they may advance further.

〈Halt〉
Only those with matters to report may do so; the year has its fixed order, and actions must follow the texts without doubt. Each has their own report, and none may resent another equally. Those who jointly accuse shall be punished, and their status shall be further debased. Though they may not descend at once, as they are dispatched by the great spirits, they must not defy the will of the gods but hand matters to the local earth deities, with no recourse to appeal above. Thus, vacancies arise, and if one does not occupy them, the upper, middle, and lower realms align as one.

Heed these words with care, for neglect brings the loss of life and longevity, binding one to the earth. The earth here is not mere soil but is guarded by baleful spirits and tasked by the celestial earth deities. If one fails to act as decreed, suffering shall swiftly follow. Even immortals may err—how can mortals presume to act with impunity? Thus, the Controller of Fate resides near the heart, never far from man, serving as the dwelling of spirit and essence. Fortune and misfortune lie within; why seek distant refuge only to invite calamity? Haste cannot preserve life if one’s allotted span is not yet exhausted, nor can flight avert fate once the reckoning is complete.

When the world convenes with the gods, the overseers know life and death. Even spirits may falter and slip, only to suffer the consequences. Thus, mortal lives cannot endure long. Therefore, divine messengers reveal these writings. If one refrains from evil and prevents malevolent spirits from ascending with reports, one may still partake in grains and sustenance for a time. Beware: do not burn mountains or shatter stones, nor harm grasses and trees, break blossoms or sever branches, or sell their fruits in markets. Let no blade sever their stems or roots entirely. Their mother shall grow wrathful and report to their father above, sparing no thought for human years.

Yet humans too depend on grasses for sustenance—take only what is withered and fallen, not what still thrives. This is the natural order. Heaven and Earth nurture life as humans wish to live; why act with abandon, harming future generations? Those with wisdom must not transgress these prohibitions. Some harm others, but if one relies on the completion of affairs and avoids taking the young to feed others, one’s life may be slightly prolonged. Yet in the end, all are recorded in the registers. Do not raise weapons to rob, threaten, or take lives by force. Heaven has decreed that such people shall not live long. Evil begets evil, troubling the spirits, the qi, and the ghostly beings, leaving none to rest. Is this not the fault of human transgressions? Past wrongdoings bring misfortune upon descendants.

Thus, children born on inauspicious days, or conceived during thunder, lightning, the waxing and waning of the moon, or on blood-avoidance or conflicting-stem days when yin and yang conjoin—such children shall not thrive and will surely meet with disaster. Earth’s qi summons them, yet they blame the wolf and the jackal. Evil is repaid with evil—what else can they expect? Those who do not change their ways shall be eradicated, their households extinguished, and their deaths unlike those of the multitude.

Officials and soldiers of this rank, when sent to desolate and unclean places, may only be buried in the earth, devoured by foxes and dogs, their remains ungathered and discarded by the roadside. Their souls and spirits shall suffer without respite, some bound to grasses and trees, consumed by the six livestock—when shall they be reborn? The punishment of evil and reward of good are known to all; why not reform? Heaven rewards merit and withholds from the virtueless. Ponder this, and the principles of reward and punishment shall be clear.

One may die alone in extreme suffering, but the longevity of good and evil shall unfold in due course. Examine this carefully and take heed, that you may avoid blame. Thus, this solemn warning is given to prompt repentance. The convergence of fortune and misfortune may lie worlds apart, so this text is set forth to admonish and caution. Do not resent Heaven’s blame or Earth’s faults—good and evil must be distinguished.

These writings are recorded so that one may know evil and turn to good, though the souls and spirits shall labor to exhaustion. Fools remain ignorant, so the words are repeated and reiterated, passed on in turn, that later generations may not incur blame. By this, one may verify for oneself—what further resentment or fault remains? Each receives their due. This text must be transmitted without cease. The wise may shorten their years, but fools shall copy these words and ignore them, bringing suffering upon themselves.

*River Bridge Admonition on Punishment for Transgressions, One Hundred and Eighty-Eighth*
〈Rise〉
In the age of high antiquity, divine sages foresaw events and governed alongside Heaven, spreading across the four directions, above and below, and the center, each with their appointed ranks and duties. High and low regarded one another, and order was achieved without sternness, all acting with goodness. Fearing any lapse, all shared a single heart. When Heaven issued commands, they hastened to carry them out, riding chariots of cloud and qi, drawn by flying dragons. The immortals who followed formed ranks, each bearing records, aligning without need for movement. Should questions arise, their conduct was governed by rules, ensuring proper action.

In spring, they nurtured the qi of growth; in summer, they fostered maturation; in autumn, they oversaw the harvest, enabling the people to offer sacrifices; and in winter, they stored the surplus grain, ensuring continuity without lapse. The blessings of the spirits extended to all, bringing glory even to crawling creatures and grasses and trees—was this not the grace of the above? Each received what was theirs.

〈Halt〉
Whenever they ate, they ensured abundance, with the new and old sustaining one another. How could they forget this? Having received the people’s aid, they ensured the spirits bore no resentment. The good were repaid, each believing they should further provide for one another. Heaven willed it so; nothing could be hoarded, lest people suffer hunger and cold.

〈Rise〉
Thus, those with wealth were commanded to lend and aid the poor, exchanging the old for the new, enabling growth and prosperity to be passed to descendants. The spirits and deities would protect and assist them—was this not the great grace of universal bestowal?

〈Halt〉
Yet fools, lacking understanding, refused to repay or give thanks, assuming it their due. Their hearts grew unbalanced, and they seized others’ possessions to adorn themselves, lacking any thought of reciprocity or regard for hardship, believing they could live out their allotted years. Thus, this text was composed again.

Divine beings and perfected ones seek the good who can transmit these writings and apply their teachings. Such people may extend their lives, increase their longevity, and unite with Heaven and Earth, transforming into spirits. They may once more ride the clouds, traversing above and below, the center, and flowing to the six directions—is this not goodness itself?

Why not reflect deeply, keeping it within your heart? The divine abodes are where spirits dwell, ever observing human actions. Do not be self-righteous; know when you are at fault. You ought to serve and uphold one another, turning from misfortune toward blessings. Even minor deeds that displease Heaven’s will are unwise.

〈Rise〉
The gods of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the five phases, and the myriad spirits—along with the officials who record human destinies—how can they not be revered? Contemplate repaying their grace. Those who refuse to do good defy the celestial spirits. The celestial spirits then cause winds and rains to fall out of season, the qi of the seasons to shift unpredictably—what should be cold turns warm, what should be warm turns cold.

〈Halt〉
Sowing and planting no longer follow the proper times, and farmers grow resentful, unwilling to tend the land for others. They scorn all grains, feeding them instead to dogs and swine, and soon abandon the fields. In lands of virtue, harvests dwindle, trees wither and shed their leaves, and the people have no surplus grain. They turn on one another, plundering and contending for dominance, thinking only of victory. Forgetting the true sovereign, they become impoverished, reaping nothing, drifting as refugees. Before reaching the lands where grain is scorned, they collapse hungry by the roadside, dizzy and blinded, staggering wildly. Days pass without food, and they starve to death, unburied. No one in their households—young or old—escapes disaster. Yet they curse Heaven for their misfortune.

Their lands grow desolate, granaries empty, with little meat and no stored coin. Each year, conditions worsen, leaving nothing to offer the court. Exemptions multiply, storehouses yield no income, and the Minister of Agriculture holds only empty documents, unable to provide rations. Salaries are withheld, and the central lands lack resources. The people look to the state for aid, yet none is given. Thus, a time of suffering arises—all this is what Heaven abhors.

The earth cannot long sustain such corruption. Do the wicked not understand?

True ones, 〈rise〉 hasten to entrust this text to lands of virtue, 〈halt〉 urging each to examine themselves and awaken. Only then may they fulfill their allotted years. Those without understanding differ not from beasts. Longevity cannot be forcibly seized; it is attained through one’s own conduct, without resentment toward Heaven.

Ponder these writings carefully. Always cultivate filial piety, loyalty, trust, benevolence, and generosity. When you err, hold yourself accountable. Then you may have descendants, for these words are not empty.

In lands without virtue, Heaven offers no protection. The celestial mechanisms turn swiftly, and the sun and moon hasten, their light dimmed. In lands of virtue, the celestial mechanisms slow, and the sun and moon shine brightly. This is Heaven’s way. The mechanisms of Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars—all favor those who act with clarity. If their light wanes, it is the result of one’s own conduct. Whom can they blame?

All share the same Heaven and Earth, sun, moon, and stars. Those who witness Heaven’s retribution see its clarity. When the five planets stray from their courses, warfare rages unchecked, and barbarians invade from within. The land dispatches armies, and those with fate return; those without perish. This is the fault of great men.

When children are unfilial and the land lacks loyal ministers, when conduct is impure, mutual conflict arises, lasting until the year’s end.

Thus, this 〈rise〉 *Scripture of the Utmost Limit*, named the *Great Peace*, is bestowed. Those who practice it gain its blessings; those who do not bring ruin upon themselves. Gather your resolve, and your body will remain whole. Heaven’s retribution never wrongs the innocent; those who do not follow it inflict evil upon others.

It is said: No one, high or low, is not born of Heaven. The difference lies only in the records of destiny. Cherish this, be cautious, and take heed. Never do what you ought not, nor wrong others, nor seize what is not yours. Heaven does not reward such deeds; the earth does not nourish them. Malevolent spirits follow, and one cannot long enjoy life.

Those who neglect themselves should not hope for life. Their names are absent from the registers of immortality, yet they force their way into the halls of transcendents. They offer sacrifices to the spirits, seeking to be delivered as immortals. But when the immortal spirits consult the ledgers, they find no record of their names. Their prayers and offerings go unanswered, and the spirits grow angry.

They wander as beggars, offending the divine. 〈Halt〉 Wild beasts devour them, leaving only bones. Foxes gnaw their remains, and they never return home. Though they claim to neighbors and kin that they have attained transcendence, no sign confirms it. How can they prove it? By this, it is clear: only when there is manifest retribution, witnessed by all, can one be said to have ascended. Otherwise, they suffer punishment, their claims mere delusions. Such people are mad or deceived, yet they take it as truth. Together, they enter the realm of the dead, descending to the Yellow Springs, powerless to choose their fate.

Those destined for transcendence have their names recorded in the ledgers while alive. When their years are complete, messengers come to welcome them. How could the ignorant and unlearned attain such a fate? They waste their wealth, abandon their homes, and wander the wilds in vain. The Way naturally grants rank and destiny to each person; it cannot be forcibly sought.

Why torment yourself? Neglecting to care for parents, wife, and children—how can this be called wisdom? Fear only that you lack filial piety, loyalty, and trust. Then you may live out your years, and in the underworld, you will face no punishment, only peace. If you have surplus wealth and property, pass it to your children and grandchildren, ensuring they are provided for. Do not torment yourself. Whether your descendants are worthy or not, each lives their own life, without passing on suffering. This is virtuous conduct.

Thus, this text is recorded for the wise. Fools disregard it, indulging in reckless joy and anger. To avoid punishment and evade misfortune is the way of the worthy. If three admonitions go unheeded, it is best to desist.

Heaven aids the good and does not favor the wicked. Each must be cautious, refraining from mutual blame. Each must plan for themselves, acting with awareness. Let none transgress against Heaven or violate what is recorded in the ledgers. Do not forcibly demand what is not yours; such demands yield no benefit.

Why is this so? Heaven does not protect the rebellious and wicked. Do not abandon your homes or cities. Bones connect to form pathways, sinews govern the desire for life and fortify cities, vessels govern movement and form the body’s network, and flesh lies beneath the skin as the vessels’ covering. The spirit dwells within, overseeing human good and evil.

Why seek distant solutions? The seven regulators govern the gates of destiny. Seek the Way and attain life; do not abandon your homes. Transform and unite with the spirits in virtue. What more does the Way demand?

Thus, this virtuous text is placed in the celestial registers.

The registers of immortals differ from those of the common folk. When the time for ascension arrives, the spirits who oversee the registers and the guarantors come forth, for they know the domains they govern and the teachings they uphold. Each has their proper sequence; one must advance when it is time to depart, and may not act of one’s own accord. The host of spirits governs together, ensuring all aligns with the heart of Heaven.

Those who precede others in cultivation possess minds bright and perceptive, free from partiality. Their conduct and their lives remain unknown to others. They existed before Heaven and Earth, transforming above and below without ever straying from the Dao. The spirits do not fully manifest, yet they establish the guiding principles. The years and months extend in all directions, with attendants placed to left and right. The stars and constellations are distinct, each with its own overseer, all striving to advance loyalty and ensure the proper division of domains.

When one sees good, one should advance; when one sees evil, one should retreat. What room is there for doubt? Each acts by their own effort, and the spirits will not lead one astray. Thus, one may achieve completion and be called a Heavenly Lord. Those who govern Heaven keep meticulous records, never straying from the measure. The domain overseers and the host of spirits thus extend to the four directions.

Each direction has its *meng*, *zhong*, and *ji*, taking turns in ascending and descending order, known as the Great Year. The Great Yin follows behind, overseeing the patterns of the earth. The four seasons are also established, governing all that is born and completed. They dwell in the wilds, where grains and grasses grow early or late.

Those near do not live long, while those far endure. Yet even they may live long, and the trees of communal groves may flourish on their own. When dynasties change, punishment extends even to descendants. Why is this so? When one’s dwelling is unsettled, abandoning the old for the new, the spirits may return.

Each person has a life-tree born in the soil of Heaven, and each season has its appointed tree: in spring, the three months of life belong to the mulberry; in summer, to the jujube and plum; in autumn, to the catalpa and *geng*; in winter, to the locust and cypress. These are the trees of the common folk. Each has an official who oversees its tree. When one’s life nears its end, the tree is half-alive; when life ends, the tree withers and falls, and the overseeing official fells it. How then can the person live on? To seek long life and avoid death, one must transform one’s heart and will, transplanting one’s tree near the Gate of Heaven, where it is called the Tree of Longevity. The spirit-officials oversee it, keeping it pure, radiant, and lustrous, born of the place where Heaven’s own arise, guarded by spirits and honored with glory.

One need only preserve one’s name without blemish. Heaven has its eternal decree, and through generations, one is adorned with honor. Though one may not descend to protect, in time, one’s essence will naturally be known. Why is this so? Having departed far from the common, one must act in accordance with Heaven’s affairs, never faltering. The spirits examine one another as a carpenter’s line marks true. How could one act of one’s own will? Thus, one does not descend.

Do not find this strange. When merit is manifest, it is not equal to that of the common folk. Though others may see no benefit to their households, within, one is adorned with glory—is this not good? Thus, this is shown to later generations, that their hearts may awaken. If this text is revealed without proper concealment, there will be punishment in the year’s end.

Do not associate with the deceitful and flattering, nor make disobedience and irreverence your heart. All should act in accord with the text’s words, or face questioning and reproach. Can one not be cautious? Transmission must be to the right person, one who can be vouched for.

Do not violate the sacred texts, do not test the words of the spirits, and heed the spirits’ admonitions—all are repaid by Heaven. Do not take them lightly, for later there will be suffering. Minor transgressions bring only demotion, but grave faults cannot be saved. Thus, the spirits take turns reporting what is fitting to their superiors. Those who are not truthful will face judgment.

Matters must be interconnected, with no room for private interests. Thus, the spirits take turns examining and upholding one another. If one regrets later, what use is doubt? The middle path is also a point of examination. If one does not confess the truth, the examination will reveal it afterward, and one’s advancement or withdrawal will also be scrutinized. Otherwise, matters remain as before—this is what is meant.

One must not take these matters lightly, nor harbor doubt.

The laws of the spirits are of great weight, thus one must be cautious and deliberate, ponder and reflect upon them. The Dao of long life and enduring vitality—how could it not be held in reverence? Therefore, this text is set forth to instruct: those who fill vacancies shall perform good deeds, passing them down without fail or omission. For those who do good, merit accumulates and years extend—there is no room for doubt. The boundless nature of the natural Dao—when will it end? Yet upon awakening, one must govern in turn, for even the slightest misstep will invite suspicion.

Heaven delights in music to gladden the spirits, and the spirits, too, listen. Those who do good receive rewards, while those whose tones or melodies are discordant will also face judgment. Each has their own master; there can be no lack of origin or end. If incomplete, all draw from Heaven’s granaries and are clothed by the Minister of Agriculture. Cold and heat alternate, garments change—this too reflects the yang’s honor and the yin’s humility. Coarse and fine, all things from gold and silver to silks, pearls, and jade treasures are to be evenly distributed, with no arbitrary bestowals, granted only to those with merit. One must not receive Heaven’s clothing and food without merit.

As stated in previous texts, this is reiterated to prevent resentment and suspicion—such is the weight of Heaven’s command over the spirits. At year’s end, ledgers are reviewed and submitted. From mountains and seas to lands and waters, all shrines and communal altars report their receipts, ensuring nothing is lost or omitted. The guardians of dwellings observe the people’s transgressions, submitting monthly records. The Minister of Agriculture and the officials of the temples must then relay these documents in turn.

The Great Yin Legal Bureau calculates what one owes and subtracts the corresponding years. Once one’s allotted span is exhausted, the yin spirits of the earth and the local earth deities are summoned to reclaim the physical form and examine the hun and po souls. Detailed ledgers are prepared, verifying whether the records align. If discrepancies arise, the responsible parties are found to have engaged in deceit or favoritism, and punishments or demotions follow according to the severity of the offense. If the ledgers are not as Heaven commands, the spirits and numinous beings may not afflict people with illness. They must instead inspect and report one another, exposing transgressions.

For grave offenses, even death may be imposed, with demotions to labor on bridges, mountains, or seas, each according to the severity of the law, ensuring no omissions. Each locale—prefectures, counties, post stations—has its overseers and officials who must examine matters according to the law, ensuring no unjust harm befalls the spirits or numinous beings. Thus, from high to low, documents circulate in accordance with established decrees.

**On the Desire for Fine Clothing and Footwear (189)**
From ancient times to the present, each has their allotted domain, with ranks above and below, and proper channels for receiving and bestowing. If one adheres strictly to the guiding line, how could one fail to discern the distinction between life and death? Each must be vigilant, not offending the spirits, and fulfill their duties without neglecting their mandate. Record these matters: the good shall be promoted, the wicked demoted. In the convergence of fortune and misfortune, each receives what they desire. One may only follow, not defy. If one’s heart and intentions are impure, blaming the spirits’ messengers, the consequences are self-inflicted—whom else could one resent?

Some are difficult to transform, knowing their own deficiencies, yet still suffer calamity. Their perverse actions exceed all bounds, yet they boast endlessly. In their comings and goings, they lack foresight, seeing only what is before them and disregarding what follows, inviting disaster and severing affection. They slander and revile the good, as if Heaven had perished above and Earth ceased below, unaware of the spirits. Those who record such matters may resolve others’ grudges by offering abundant wine and meat, indulging in sweetness and self-gratification. At the time, it may seem acceptable, but later, they are spoken of with scorn—light words, curses, and vile imprecations, deceit, slander, and the abduction of others’ wives. Day and night, they lie in wait to seize opportunities, selling them for their own sustenance. Coveting fine clothing and footwear, they vie in contention and argument, disregarding reason in their pursuit of livelihood—how could such a life endure?

Fools become notorious villains. When officials learn of them, subordinates are dispatched to seize and swiftly punish them, bringing disaster upon both kin and strangers, all sharing in the blame. The poor should rely on their own efforts, not idly fold their hands. These are the records of one’s life, the endowment one receives at birth. Evil spirits follow them—how could they remain long? Such people are many, and their fates intertwine without cease. Thus, it is said: seized by evil spirits, even a slight lapse in vigilance leads to ruin. If one does not restrain oneself, evil cannot be averted, and one incurs the resentment of others. At the time, it may seem acceptable, but one does not consider the consequences. Heed the warnings and desist. One may yet live a little longer, exhausting the remainder of one’s allotted span.

There are records of good and evil, the origins of longevity, and the appointed time for extending one’s years—one must do good. Those who do not see the worthies and sages are deficient in wisdom. Cherishing life and dreading death, even immortals and transcendent beings may extend their years. Why abandon the world, inviting misfortune to flow from birth? Even the child in the womb declares, “I am born of the same parents.” Yet they blame Heaven and curse Earth, claiming evil should be separate, not mingled—pure and turbid divided, like lord and servant. Thus, those who practice the great Dao live, while those who do not become dust. This has been so from ancient times to the present. There are both good and evil, passed down through generations without end—only varying in degree.

Heaven knows of much defiance, hence this text is issued to emphasize the point. After understanding the warnings, there should be no doubt. Ten or a hundred correspond—when could one escape? Those who do not forget the admonitions will long receive the secret of blessings.

**The Secret of Long-Lasting Blessings (190)**
At the beginning, Heaven and Earth arose from the primordial origin, forming the spiritual essence. Following the natural order, all that is created and transformed attains glory. With the establishment of divisions, the sun, moon, and stars, the celestial mechanisms and their overseers, the five planets are each assigned their directions and duties. Clouds and rain are distributed, the people’s concerns and the Minister of Agriculture’s affairs are managed. The primordial qi gathers and lingers, and all grains, plants, and creatures—those that crawl, breathe, or wriggle—contain the primordial qi. Flying birds, walking beasts, and those born in water are the same, enabling the people to use them in sacrifices and for their own sustenance.

Only those that cause harm are taken for personal use. Oxen, horses, mules, and donkeys unfit for service are provided for the world. Even the earth deities have surplus, gathered to share and consume. Do not kill those fit for use or the young—this is Heaven’s decree, what the spirits and numinous beings revere.

〈Thus begins〉
The myriad people, foolish and reckless, indulge in wanton killing and harm. Some slaughter creatures still in the womb, turning life to death—this severs the thread of destiny to feed human mouths. At the moment of death, all tremble in terror, knowing they will not live. Therefore, Heaven in its sincerity pities and compassionately enacts prohibitions, punishing those who violate them. Even the six domestic animals shun wanton cruelty, unable to bear injury inflicted midlife—yet humans, who should cherish themselves, instead act as bandits and plunderers. Their predations are manifold, wielding blades to kill without consequence. Though not immediately executed, Heaven accumulates their transgressions; their slaughter and ruin never cease. Those who perish before birth or whose corpses drift downstream—none of these will encounter fortune. Ghosts and spirits despise them, and the overseers stand before them—when could they ever escape?

Thus, good and evil are recorded and weighed, that one might avoid transgression. Divine beings and perfected ones reveal this text to the people, its meaning unhidden, so they may not blame themselves. Hence, it follows custom in its script, making all clear.
〈Thus ends〉

One may know that the sagely and wise do not transgress, while the foolish do not cease. Teachers have their predecessors and successors—let none forget their roots. Cherish the root to embrace the new, longing as in the beginning: this is the Way of life. Merits may be great or small, and what one receives differs accordingly. One must awaken to the secrets of the unknown, the intentions of the unknown, the thoughts of the unknown, the words of the unknown, the aspirations of the unknown—when these two are made clear, it is Heaven’s intent. The Way of life and completion emerges from this.
〈Thus begins〉

Gain trust from Heaven, gain trust from Earth, gain trust from the Center and Harmony, gain trust from the four seasons, gain trust from the five phases—all these are the rewards Heaven bestows for trust. Not a fraction is lost—do you not understand? This is the transformation wrought by the formless, self-so qi. Thus, the Three Terraces and Seven Stars assist in rectifying Heaven’s majesty. The sun and moon illuminate right and wrong, enabling the natural order, so that none may later regret. Therefore, Heaven again commands all overseers under its jurisdiction, each to make their duties clear, to accept punishment without resentment—this is the meaning.

〈Thus ends〉
Let none impose right and wrong, for others will rectify it themselves. No warning is too great or small to serve as a model. Heed these words, and you will long receive fortune—act with care, never losing restraint. Thus, words are tested by self-sacrifice. When texts remain unused, emperors and kings do not believe. Flatterers at their side prevent the texts from being understood.
〈Thus begins〉

When disasters and calamities arise together, where can the people turn? The *Scripture of Great Peace* will not be understood again for three *jiazi* cycles—better to admonish ten times so they may know. Strive to seek understanding, for the worthy and sagely may yet attain it. The sage should promote the worthy, then seek life for themselves, not despising those who follow. The register of divine transcendents lies at the North Pole, linked to Kunlun. Within Kunlun’s ruins dwell the perfected ones, who ascend and descend by constant rule. The perfected ones oversee those recorded in the registers, their names listed in order. The exalted attain the exalted, the middling the middling, the lowly the lowly—none grovel or beg. The first to teach is called master, honored as lord, revered as father. Thus, master, lord, and father must not be unclear; ministers must not be disloyal; disciples must not be disobedient. Respect and follow your superiors, and this reverence will ascend. Thus, Heaven does not forget the master’s kindness, Earth does not forget the master’s nurturing, and people do not forget the master’s teaching.
〈Thus ends〉

Thus, those who possess loyalty, filial piety, and trust think of life without malice, drawing near to clarify themselves. Heaven’s light shines down to the Yellow Springs below; Earth’s light shines up to the space between the heavens. The light of the Center and Harmony unites above and below. Thus, the Three Lights converge and harmonize.
〈Thus begins〉

Heaven names the Three Lights as the sun, moon, and stars, which shine down upon the Center and Harmony and the depths of Earth without ceasing. In nations lacking virtue, yin qi obscures the sun, rendering it lightless. The people live in fear, grains grow scarce, water and drought strike unpredictably, and the people flee as refugees to lands with grain. Heaven pities them, guiding them to live in enlightened lands where a wise ruler brings prosperity. The refugees return to cultivate abandoned fields, and all grains are sown. Once they ripen and the people regain their sustenance, they again honor their ancestors, and the ghosts and spirits find peace. Among them are the sagely and wise who seek divine transcendents, whose names are recorded in registers and ledgers. They will ascend to become Heaven’s officials, patrolling among the people, harmonizing wind and rain, and bringing stable governance. This text is shown to later generations. Thus, one must do good to benefit Heaven. From this point onward, admonish your descendants—may they attain longevity. Though the text is weighty, Heaven deeply loves humanity and wishes them to complete their years. Its repeated exhortations are entrusted to the spirits. Good deeds are promptly recorded above, while evil erases one’s name. Do not defy this text; reflect on goodness with an 〈unbroken〉 mind, and always nurture the aspiration for life. The reason is that human aspirations must be fulfilled—strive with diligence, each according to their wish, for Heaven neither forces nor rejects. Earth extends horizontally in all four directions, and so do the boundless heavens, the boundless earth, and the boundless realms. So too are the boundless light and boundless radiance. Yet even the smallest completion is Heaven’s great division. To govern and reflect on Heaven’s affairs, Heaven governs and reflects on the Center and Harmony, and the Center and Harmony stabilizes them. To seek nobility, the spirits of nobility honor it. To seek wealth, the spirits of wealth enrich it. Between suffering and joy, always reflect carefully on your words. Heaven’s Dao is vast and myriad—it lies in human action and does not override human wishes. The Way of life and nurturing is clear to see; the Way of death is what ghosts dread. Malevolent spirits are unsettled and immediately bring calamity—this text cannot describe it.
〈Thus begins〉

In Heaven there is a text, the root of seeking life. It is what humans desire, so this text is revealed to inspire reflection.

Should one commit transgressions and repent, consult this text. If not, then desist—speak no reckless words. The divine spirits stand before and behind you at all times, without respite.

〈End〉

〈Beginning〉 The *Scripture of Great Peace* bestows prosperity upon the state, subdues rebellion, and illuminates the teachings of former sages and worthies. The Dao of Heaven and Earth rejoices, and the spirits emerge to aid in governance, granting longevity to the people and repelling the barbarians of the four directions. 〈End〉

*Collated and Combined Scroll 113 of the Geng Section, Volume 113 of the Scripture of Great Peace*
*Chapter 191: The Formula of Joy, Anger, Fortune, and Misfortune*

〈Beginning〉 When the qi of Great Peace arrives in full, the people should daily face one another in leisure, ever equipped with musical instruments as their constant practice. Through harmonious tuning, they transform one another, benefiting the state above. This harmonizes the celestial qi, perpetually delighting the state with longevity, while the world is enveloped in its virtue and teaching, free from fault.

How is it made clear whether joy is attained or not? How is the effect of harmony or disharmony demonstrated? 〈End〉

Desiring not to trouble the Celestial Master with exhaustive inquiry, yet fearing superficiality and omissions, I have repeatedly asked these questions, daring not to slacken, lest Heaven grow angry.

〈Beginning〉 Excellent! You inquire on Heaven’s behalf, daily refining your understanding and aligning with Heaven’s intent. The Perfected One shall surely gain boundless years and longevity, for Heaven protects you. Very well, be seated, and I shall once more expound its meaning in full for all disciples, making it clear and knowable.

Joy, when modestly equipped and modestly realized, delights the people. When moderately equipped and moderately realized, it delights governance. When fully equipped and fully realized, it delights Heaven and Earth.

Those who attain the method of delighting the people bring joy to humanity. Those who attain the method of delighting governance bring peace to governance. Those who attain the method of delighting Heaven and Earth bring harmony to Heaven and Earth. When Heaven and Earth are harmonious, all things remain free from illness, and the host of spirits perpetually rejoice, never growing angry.

〈Attached Note〉 Those who align with the intent of Heaven and Earth harmonize them, and humanity, following their example, finds joy. When Heaven, Earth, and humanity are harmonious and joyful, the myriad things suffer no illness, and ruler and minister perpetually rejoice.

〈Beginning〉 This is the joy of the arrival of the true qi of Great Peace, fully realized through music.

Thus, when music attains the great *jue* and upper *jue* tones, the Green Emperor rejoices greatly, and the virtue of benevolence and the Dao emerge. All things delight in life, the Green Emperor sets forth on his journey, and the qi of the liver remains free from illness. The spirit and essence of the liver manifest, appearing in the eastern direction and its kind. The malign is entirely dispelled, while the good all advance to aid transformation. Azure-clad jade maidens bearing wondrous prescriptions descend to bestow them upon humanity—this is the clear proof.

Perfected One, ponder this meaning deeply. 〈End〉

"Yes, yes."

Thus, when the upper *jue* tone is attained, transformation occurs above; when the middle *jue* tone is attained, transformation occurs in the middle; when the lower *jue* tone is attained, transformation occurs below. And through their attainment, transformation is achieved.

When the *zhi* tones of the south—great, small, and middle—are all in harmony, all things delight in growth. In the southern direction, virtue and the Dao know no joy unshared; the malign is dispelled, and the good all advance. The red qi rejoices entirely, the red spirit comes forth on its journey, and the heart remains free from illness. The heart’s spirit emerges and appears, awaiting the arrival of the crimson-clad jade maidens, who come to bestow wondrous prescriptions upon humanity—this is its great proof.

Thus, when the harmony of the yellow qi’s *gong* tone is attained, the good of the *gong* tone also all arrive, while the malign is entirely dissolved. When the harmony of the *shang* tone is attained, the good of the *shang* tone all arrive, while the malign is entirely dissolved. When the harmony of the *yu* tone is attained, the good of the *yu* tone all arrive, while the malign all depart.

Perfected One, ponder deeply the essential meaning of what brings forth these effects and their fundamental practices. The reason I do not exhaustively expound on the five directions is that their profundity is vast. The superior scholar, upon seeing this, naturally grasps its meaning, using the one to embrace the ten thousand; the middling scholar, upon attaining it, must guard against excessive joy.

When the inferior person obtains it, they may speak recklessly. Thus, I do not fully reveal it, allowing ordinary people to each contemplate its meaning. The superior scholar, with the one embracing the ten thousand, naturally comprehends its essence and needs no exhaustive explanation. The middling scholar, gradually nearing understanding, also requires no exhaustive explanation. The inferior scholar, if they obtain it, may speak recklessly—likewise, no exhaustive explanation is needed.

Therefore, I cautiously shape my words, briefly outlining the essential principles to reveal the matter, guiding ordinary people to each reflect on its meaning. In this way, understanding may flow freely from high to low without error. Perfected One, do you grasp this?

"Yes, indeed."

Thus, the superior scholar governs music to enact non-action and transcend the world. The middling scholar governs music to harmonize and regulate the common people. The inferior scholar governs music merely to entertain others and secure sustenance. These three types each follow their own intentions. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, let them act as they will, allowing them their instruments—lutes and zithers—taking care not to forbid them. If music’s qi is suppressed, governance becomes difficult to pacify. When governance is difficult to pacify, qi contends and disputes arise, leading to excessive punishments.

Music brings joy, while punishments bring suffering—like echo and shadow, not a hair’s breadth is amiss. Music is meant to quell anger, while anger is meant to quell music. These two oppose each other: thus, when music prevails, anger ceases; when anger prevails, music ceases. Anger gives rise to punishments and is the root of conflict, while joy and music are the gateway to virtue and the Dao. Therefore, one should follow this path to cultivate the root of virtue and the Dao, not suppress it. Suppression, instead, opens the door to punishment and misfortune. Here lies the source of fortune and misfortune, the rise of safety and peril.

Music belongs to yang; punishments belong to yin. Yin and yang are inherently opposed: when yang flourishes, yin wanes; when yin flourishes, yang wanes. Yang is the ruler; yin is the minister. When the ruler is strong, the minister submits, and the people are easily governed. When the minister is strong, the ruler is humiliated and order collapses. This is the natural law of Heaven.

Therefore, one should follow the ruler’s music to subdue the people and ministers, curbing their frequent anger. The people of later ages are foolish and do not deeply understand this principle, instead often cutting it off. Thus, yin qi flourishes while yang qi declines. When yin qi flourishes, thieves and criminals abound unceasingly. All things fail to thrive, often harmed by yin—this is the great fault. When the qi of music flourishes, yang qi prevails, severing this harm. When the ruler’s qi is strong, it brings extended years and prolonged life; when suppressed, it leads to premature aging.

Leisure and music belong to Heaven above; haste, anger, and punishments belong to Earth below. When the upper path is followed, all affairs are ordered; when the lower path is followed, all affairs descend into chaos.

"True Person, take heed—can these words not be deeply pondered?"
"Indeed, indeed."
"You may be said to have grasped them profoundly. Transmit them to enlighten the people of later ages, that each may reflect upon their meaning and take care never to obstruct or sever them. When music arises, the virtues and powers of the five directions all emerge; when anger arises, the evils of the five directions all emerge. When there is music, the virtues and powers of Heaven and Earth all emerge; when there is anger, the evils of Heaven and Earth all emerge. Thus, when Heaven and Earth are joyful, good responses arise; when Heaven and Earth are not joyful, evil responses arise. When the five directions are joyful and harmonious, good responses from the five directions arise; when the five directions are not joyful but angry, evil responses from the five directions arise. This is no small matter—thus it is said: do not sever it. Let all people together contemplate its meaning, all awakening to it as one, so that the qi of joy and music arrives, and the qi of haste and anger departs."
"Excellent! Excellent!"
"Go forth—you have understood it well."

Here follows the translation:

**Right [Section]: Heaven’s Supreme Distinction of Joy and Anger as the Source of Fortune and Misfortune**
*Collated and Combined Text of the* Classic of Great Peace, *Volume 114, Geng Section XII*
*Classic of Great Peace, Volume 114*
*Certain Formula 192*

According to the Dunhuang catalog, this should be *Filial Conduct Revered by Spirits, Formula 192*. The preceding text was originally missing.

When one suffers illness or hardship, the heart grieves deeply; bowing before the physician, one amends with words of filial piety. Serving with reverence and respect, one offers up all that the household possesses. Addressing the physician with honor, the healer, seeing this, holds the person in esteem. One spares no effort in seeking true, fresh, and fine medicines, apportioning grains by their proper divisions so that the physician may be summoned to bring relief. Constantly shedding tears, one speaks, confessing faults before Heaven, striking one’s breast to beg for mercy, kowtowing to the earth without shunning tiles, stones, or mud.

Thus, one secures the peace and safety of one’s parents, teaching sons and daughters-in-law always to remain at their elders’ side, preparing rich, sweet, and delicate foods, allowing them to eat whatever their mouths desire. When parents manage the household, if anything is lacking, one grieves for one’s children and grandchildren, exhausting all the household possesses, displaying utmost filial devotion before them. Relatives and neighbors, witnessing such filial goodness and knowing there is nothing left to give, come forth to provide further provisions, calling for physicians and spreading mats for them, together laboring day and night. They inquire after the parents’ well-being, tending to their needs, and upon hearing even the slightest word of kindness, their hearts rejoice—this is the result of filial piety.

Heaven, seeing such a filial heart, grants recovery, restoring health as before, and the heart rejoices anew. When the body is once more able to consume grains, one fasts and sells goods, offering up all possessions to Heaven, returning thanks to the ancestors. For all blessings received, one burns pure incense, never daring to break one’s word—such is the conduct proper to a filial child.

The world hears of such goodness yet cannot practice it; those who can are naturally so by nature. Heaven endows their fate, causing them to be filial and good, passing this virtue down through generations. Their livelihood improves, they do not encroach upon others, and they benefit their kin. In marriages and neighborly relations, filial ones receive recompense, never forgetting kindness—such is the excellence of this Way.

The years of one’s parents cannot be foreknown. One prepares in advance, reducing minor expenses, ensuring yearly surplus, storing it in unseen places, never letting officials high or low learn of it. When levies and requisitions come, depleting all one’s wealth, yet the heart of filial devotion remains unfulfilled, and nothing more remains to give—when the parents’ years come to an end, there is nothing to offer in farewell, and the intent of filial piety remains incomplete.

Those who practice filial piety contemplate the completion of their work. When merit is manifest and name ascends to the Supreme, reaching the imperial court, and local authorities recommend them, in a single day they are honored—is this not the result of filial piety? Descendants inherit this, and it may continue for boundless generations. This remembrance of kindness is never forgotten, and Heaven deems it good. Heaven sends benevolent spirits to constantly guard and protect—this too is the result of filial piety.

In such a household, one member may attain long life and transcend the world. Later generations revere them, free from calamity, each completing their years without premature death—is this not goodness? From such goodness, what is not accomplished? What is not achieved? What is not obtained? What is not made smooth?

Strive to practice this, never growing weary or lax. Such is the fortune of the good.

The filial and good are not encroached upon by others; should anyone encroach upon the filial and good, Heaven will punish them. This is evident before one’s eyes—thus it is known. To know goodness as goodness and filial piety as filial piety, yet find it bitter to emulate—this arises naturally.

Heaven bestows the register of the good; goodness and filial piety transmit themselves, surpassing and recommending one another without limit. The filial and good are naturally revered by others, and they do not offend or harm people. Their reputation spreads to the eight distant regions, and when vacancies arise among prefectural and county officials, the filial and good households are known in advance. The county recommends them, and local officials, desiring to hear of their filial goodness, send messengers to inquire and comfort them. Those who take it to heart visit in person, learning of their conduct and recommending them. Year after year, they are honored, wearing tokens of high virtue, their descendants carrying on the tradition. Their household is known as one of transmitted filial piety, free from evil people.

Not only do they practice filial piety at home, but it extends within and without. As officials, they are filial to their lord, increasing their loyalty and sincerity, always holding high office, filial to the court. When prefectures and counties produce rare and counterfeit goods, they use their own wealth to purchase the finest, sparing the people from trouble and labor. When prefectures and counties are filled with kindness and filial piety, the five grains flourish, and no one dies prematurely. Heaven harmonizes wind and rain for them, making the seasons timely.

Such are the filial and good of Heaven above, spared from disaster. The people follow their example, all nurturing hearts of obedience, and Heaven does not oppose them. This goodness is most good, this filial loyalty most filial—thus it is perfected. It causes the unfilial throughout the world to emulate, setting forth the intent of filial piety.

When a great mandate grants amnesty to the world, all transgressions that should not be committed are absolved. Together with the filial, the fraternal, and those who labor in the fields, they are bestowed with silks, wine, and meat. Officials pay their respects, making their filial conduct known so that others may witness it. Those who see it, if they have hearts, may advance in love; if they have good intent, they may love one another—this is the grace of the world, making the people compliant.

This is goodness begetting goodness, filial piety begetting filial piety; those unfilial in origin remain unfilial in the end, and evil in origin remains evil in the end. The good have their wishes fulfilled, living to white-haired old age. Some reach one hundred and twenty years, others over a hundred—this is the result of goodness and filial piety, not mere empty words.

Not only does Heaven love them, but the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, and stars all favor them, shining upon them so they do not encounter misfortune. Such is their goodness—can it not be esteemed?

Heaven creates the people, yet few can be good and filial. Those who do so alone enjoy long life.

---

Those who attain high office do so through the practice of filial piety. This is not mere empty assurance—thus this scripture is revealed to instruct the living. Those who follow its model shall be granted longevity and transmission, their descendants safeguarded. Once this text is disseminated, filial piety must be practiced. Those who transcend the world through filial devotion may further aspire to ranks and titles.

Of all affairs under Heaven, filial piety is foremost, surpassing what most can attain. Through accumulated merit and layered conduct, past and present align without loss. Those whose names are reborn among men inherit their parents’ grace and behold the teachings of filial reverence. Heaven inscribes their registry, placing them among the undying—such is the household of filial piety. They may further attain transcendence, performing celestial duties above, recording loyalty and filial devotion in revered texts, assuming heavenly offices where honor and favor grow daily.

In Heaven, they are named "Filial and Virtuous Divine Beings," revered by all spirits. Their offerings of finest food ascend first, their filial deeds enduring—none compare. Their longevity knows no limit, their radiance ever-increasing. Above, they behold the boundless heavens; below, the boundless earth; in all directions, they traverse boundless realms. They foresee events yet to come, and all spirits heed their commands, never opposing their will, jointly recommending and proclaiming them.

The Supreme Lord, witnessing their unmatched filial conduct, draws them near, both within and without, where gods hold them in ever-greater esteem. Thus it is said: what Heaven loves, all spirits honor; what Heaven detests, all spirits endanger. This is known—let each apply their own discernment, choosing what is fitting and following what is proper.

The scripture’s words now pause, yet its later teachings must be heeded. When goodness is attained, it shall be revealed again, ensuring nothing is omitted.

**The Supreme Lord’s Personal Instructions, Scroll One Hundred Ninety-Three**

Only the Supreme Lord possesses statutes, illuminating and penetrating all, knowing all without obstruction, foreseeing events yet to unfold. Before spirits speak, He already knows their intent; before gods appear, He already perceives—none dare deceive or distort, for all is clear and evident. How could the words of the Supreme Lord fail to move all? Yet men revere in word alone, their hearts not fully devoted. Thus, their intentions remain unilluminated.

The reason is this: the Supreme Lord is wholly divine, governing all generation and transformation, determining life and vitality—all is known. The divine registry follows in order, distinguishing rank and dignity—who would dare disobey? Above the Nine August Ones stand the Nine Lords, who are the intimates of the Supreme Lord. Each has their own conduct, bestowing grace and benevolence, and all spirits follow, revering their deeds, none failing to comply.

Lesser spirits cannot fathom the intent of the Nine August Ones—how much less can worldly men? With sagacious minds and keen ears, one may observe their literary compositions and celestial decrees. When the registry’s words are directly recorded, radiance naturally arises. All are inscribed on golden tablets, their texts wrought in silver. This ledger resides within the Heavenly Lord’s inner chamber, its duplicate stored in the Central Ultimate. Other departmental documents are likewise submitted on jade slips, their texts self-generating, their essence following the characters—named "Luminous Radiance."

Whenever speech is uttered, it instantly illuminates all that is known, never contradicting what is said. When divine beings and perfected ones receive the Heavenly Lord’s words, they fully proclaim them, and spirits above and below all know the affairs of the mortal realm. The Heavenly Lord knows the spirits’ words, never deviating from the bounds of written rules. This is the natural Dao—what is unknown? What cannot be transformed? All actions and movements are free from partiality.

They partake of the celestial kitchen’s fare and wear garments of refined essence—what more could they seek? Such is the conduct of the Supreme Lord. Great and minor spirits each have their own duties, all mutually reverent, none daring to act selfishly. They freely observe those who seek, discerning the intentions of the earnest, knowing what can be achieved, ensuring no confusion clouds their purpose, so each may follow their deepest aspirations.

It is said: you shall all receive the immortal register, attaining boundless longevity. With sashes of purple scripted in gold and silver, you shall be enfeoffed as marquises with domains, further granted silks, gold, silver, pearls, and jade—whatever your heart desires. Is this not the Dao of immortality? Does it not discern whether a person is steadfast or not? Some are bestowed with the likeness of beauties and jade maidens, who serve them with pleasing appearances and convenience, their resolve unwavering. Others command great and small apparitions, their forms shifting, their thoughts following the practitioner’s intentions for future lives—this is the path of incompletion.

Some are placed in deep mountains and vast valleys, among beasts, tigers, and wolves, or in deep waters to test their resolve. Others encounter venomous creatures, compelling them to slay. Some fear ascending high mountains, entering deep valleys, or plunging into deep waters—thus their Dao remains unfulfilled. These apparitions warn the practitioner, for only those who remain steadfast in adversity, whose resolve does not waver amid delusion, who traverse mountains, valleys, and deep waters without fear, who behold beauty yet do not covet, who see family and kin yet are not detained—only they attain the path of life.

Advancing to behold the Supreme Lord, they offer utmost loyalty and filial devotion, unconcerned with worldly attachments—this is the way to completion. Let this admonish the multitude, that they may grasp its essential teachings. Heaven too trusts the good, enabling spirits and immortals to deliver them. If the person is inherently good, how could Heaven deceive them? Those who are deceived do so through their own doubt, forcibly demanding the useless trappings of immortality, seeking ease without merit—how could they not be deceived?

Heaven cherishes life, loving sincerity and unwavering resolve, emphasizing the Three Illuminations as essential. The Three Illuminations are the heart, which governs the Hall of Light, channeling the radiance of sun and moon—this is the completion of the Dao through the Three Illuminations. The heart’s resolve must remain unshaken, for there are records and decrees that cannot be forcibly sought. Those who ascend to Heaven in broad daylight possess their own authenticity. Their nature is inherently good, their hearts inherently luminous.

When admonitions stir the will, it does not incline toward evil; wealth and profit are disregarded; garments are coarse, barely covering the body—such is the conduct of those who ascend to Heaven.

Heaven cherishes their goodness, thus commanding benevolent spirits to follow and protect them, preventing them from encountering evil. The celestial gods favor them, enabling them to fulfill their merit. This arises from their conduct—such a person does not covet the vast wealth of the mundane world. Heaven recognizes their utmost sincerity, verifying their names in the celestial registers as true, and they naturally possess auspicious stars. From the moment of their birth, they refrain from evil. Heaven further approves of them, transforming their greed to assist the Heavenly Lord in governance. Their celestial documents and decrees are transmitted with clarity, their actions free from selfish concealment. Their years of practice are recorded, their names inscribed in the register of honor—this accords with the will of the Most High. They can expound upon their merits and deeds, aiding where others fall short, and thus the gods duly shelter and protect them. Heaven trusts those who are filial, sincere in goodness, and whose conduct is without flaw or blemish. Therefore, at broad daylight, they are received with welcome, their presence radiant before and behind, witnessed by all people—this is the fruition of their merit, allowing others to behold their virtue.

Among those who ascend in daylight, not one in a million attains this. Those who do are greatly protected and trusted by the celestial gods. Others cannot compare. As for those who achieve liberation through *shijie*, only one in a million emerges. Though their merits differ in magnitude, they recommend and commend one another, and such a person is cherished and esteemed by Heaven. Internally, they gain the trust of the Most High, who recommends them as proven and effective, each fulfilling their merit and renown—how could this be evil?

When the Heavenly Lord issues teachings, the gods do not distort his words. The Heavenly Lord, having received their proven sincerity, knows what is yet to come and permits not even a hair’s breadth of deception. All are granted longevity, even if only briefly, and those who achieve minor liberation later reflect upon their unfinished words, further contemplating the Dao.

**Admonition One Hundred Ninety-Four: On the Impossibility of Long Life for the Unfilial**
From ancient times to the present, the world has been filled with those who fail to meet expectations. If one merely seeks self-satisfaction without loyal devotion to duty...

Those who speak and teach delight in nothing extraordinary; when they see others doing good, they smile and speak—yet what benefit does this bring? Their words are careless and reckless, deceiving even father and son. They remain silent to one’s face, then depart and speak behind their backs, their words now good, now evil, offering no model to follow, no benefit to the world. The world is but dust and grime, their speech flowing unchecked, with none to record their good deeds. Their hearts claim virtue, yet their actions do not match; they lack steadfastness, their words drifting like flotsam, unworthy of trust. Such are the reckless—how can they endure? How can they be ranked with those of good heart and resolve?

Those who seek life and dread death wish not to see such wicked men, yet fail to recognize their own nature, boasting of their vigor, believing few can surpass them. They lie in wait day and night to seize wealth without merit, yet do not toil for it, imagining they may long abide in harmony, speaking freely among others. Those nearby witness this and reproach their words. The spirits hear and observe their every move, knowing their hearts’ wickedness, that they cannot long remain good, and report back to the heavenly gods: *"Within the harmony of the world dwells one of reckless speech and facile words, who cannot long remain good. In but a moment, their evil words resurface, devoid of trust or efficacy. They merely flatter and deceive—what benefit do they bring to others?"*

They are granted the grains to eat and silks to wear, changing garments with winter and summer, seeking food that pleases the palate and clothes that comfort the body. Though markets offer profitable ventures, they refuse to pursue them, yet claim to support aged parents. At dawn, they rise from bed, not knowing where they go. They peddle all they possess, shifting between host and guest, lounging in taverns with legs splayed, jesting and laughing, singing and dancing, making merry, boasting of their strength. They huddle together, whispering, spreading gossip and slander. Their wealth exhausted, they have nothing left to sustain themselves; bound in wickedness, they become villains, unrestrained, abandoning themselves to evil—how could they know even half a day of goodness?

Their actions bring no benefit to their households, only sorrow and poison to their parents, siblings, wives, and children, who are ever burdened with worry, finding no relief. Their plunder and theft know no end; though they see their hair turn white, they remain unaware that the spirits sent by Heaven watch at their side, enter their bodies, and hasten their deeds. They are made to meet misfortune, their years cut short—they cannot be allowed to endure. Their clamor for evil will not cease. Should their crimes reach the authorities, they will be seized and justly punished, denied long life. Death will claim them—how can they live again? Some may even be harmed by ghosts and spirits.

Parents think of them, ever seeing them weep alone in solitary vigil, with none to aid or support. In old age, they are abandoned and discarded, their food foul and meager, rarely tasting anything rich or fine. Their clothes and shoes are worn through, with none to mend them. Such is the extremity of evil—years and months pass, emptiness endures, their faces grow hideous, bearing no semblance of human countenance.

As sons of this kind, they leave their parents in old age with no one to rely upon, and even their kin refuse to acknowledge them. This is the utmost destruction wrought by the conduct of the wicked. Their kin suffer for it, and their name is shrouded in obscurity. When such a son dies, he is not given a proper burial; lacking shroud or coffin, he is simply buried. Foxes and jackals devour him, his bones cast into the wilderness—when shall he ever again know the comforts of clothing and food?

Thus the consequences of good and evil are plain to see: man brings them upon himself. Whom can he blame? How profoundly foolish are the people of the world, failing to consider the vast gulf between life and death! While alive, one possesses qi and beholds the radiance of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars. But in death, can one ever again know the light of Heaven? In that dark and obscure realm, when shall there be light?

Fools do not ponder deeply, bringing calamity upon their descendants, disasters beyond remedy, misfortunes that flow to future generations—whose fault is this? If men do not reform, they bring about their own untimely demise. Should they not follow the Way of the virtuous and the immortals? In their actions and words, they ought to adhere to principle, bringing benefit to their parents, ensuring they are well-fed and clothed, their faces glowing with health.

Such is the conduct of a filial son, whose strength is not that of an evil man. Should he not repay the debt of his parents’ nurturing care? To be an unfilial son—when you have children, will they be filial to you? Good begets good, evil begets evil, like a mirror reflecting a person. Can you truly be ignorant of this truth?

Thus the records of good and evil share the same script, yet the difference between long life and early death—how vast is it? A living person may endure for a span of years, but when their allotted time is spent, they perish and become a ghost, no longer subject to reckoning. The wicked die young, and in the underworld, they are seized and punished, held accountable for their misdeeds. They suffer in their place of torment, never knowing joy. As ghosts, when shall they ever know reprieve?

Such is the extremity of evil: even as ghosts, they remain wicked, with nowhere to turn. Their families lack food, and they must beg for sustenance, pursued by the qi of debt and ruin, unable to endure. The underworld, too, desires good ghosts and rejects the evil. Thus, each should reflect upon goodness, not losing their proper measure—this alone suffices. Otherwise, what hope remains?

People ought to share a common purpose, aligning their wishes with life. Does Heaven not favor goodness? Why then do they turn to evil? The conduct of the wicked cannot long endure beneath the sun, moon, and stars. Thus, they are hidden away in the underworld, denied the company of good ghosts and the joy of distinction.

Where the text repeats itself, it is because Heaven truly detests the wicked and will not suffer them to live long. Those of good nature are protected by Heaven. Their descendants are born with goodness, free from taboos, born under auspicious stars and the radiance of the sun and moon. How can they not enjoy long life? Such is the reward of virtuous conduct.

In the discernment of good and evil, one may follow what brings peace. Heaven does not oppose the deeds of men. Reflect again and again, ponder deeply—whether to advance or retreat, if one does not cling to life, there is nothing to be done. The words of the text are clear; examine them closely.

Let your suffering reach its limit, yet do not grow weary of life. Be cautious in your speech. Though the words may briefly pause, let them linger in your thoughts. If they do not satisfy, reconsider them.

**Admonition Against Transgressing Evil Precepts, One Hundred and Ninety-Five**

Now, those of sagely virtue each have their words, each their speech. They distinguish their abilities, rank their merits, and accomplish what is fitting, so that their teachings may be trusted and the words of Heaven revered. Heaven loves humanity and bestows great merit, winning the heart of Heaven—this is the aspiration of sagely virtue.

All people wish to align with Heaven, to grasp its intent, and harbor no resentment. Thus, each is allowed to follow their will, without falsehood, for this is how one gains the favor of others, ensuring that trust and understanding are reciprocated, and that all follow what is fitting.

To live in this world is no easy matter. In every action, one must heed what is said, never straying from the proper path. Yet some do not reproach themselves and instead resent the words of others—this is unjust conduct. Each harbors grievances, provoking Heaven’s wrath and causing it to withhold love, declaring that life is fleeting.

Thus, there are those in the world with sagely hearts and great harmony, who speak their intent, revealing the origins of transgressions and urging reform. For the length of a person’s life arises from within, not from others. Therefore, it is said that the Controller of Fate resides near, within the heart, not far from man. It judges right and wrong, and when one errs, it retreats—how can there be delay? It immediately shortens one’s years.

For those who know the unvirtuous, Heaven desires that they hear its admonitions and find peace. In moments of fault, it urges reflection, so that they may accept punishment and lose years, without harboring resentment. Heaven is vastly patient, and punishment is not meted out in a single day. Only when transgressions accumulate greatly does it dispatch the underworld’s officials to seize the person’s hun and shen, interrogating their deeds. If these do not align with the patterns of Heaven and are instead deceitful, the deceit is exposed, and the primary offense is revealed—such sins cannot be pardoned.

Thus, Heaven again issues decrees to enlighten, explaining that the disasters wrought by evil conduct urge reform. If one ignores these words, how can they long remain among the living? Therefore, good and evil are distinguished, so that none may harbor resentment. Heaven sets prohibitions to prevent transgression. Yet if one deliberately violates them, admonishing the celestial spirits, how can they long endure among men?

Thus, the distinction between good and evil is made, so that none may complain.

Does conduct such as this constitute the Way to prevent human death? Or does it imply that Heaven is unaware? The conduct of common folk cannot be adopted in this manner—how can one long remain within the harmony of the central qi, partaking of what is edible? Yet they turn away from the protection of benevolent spirits, and their years are cut short. When the time of celestial beings is unobstructed, this is proof of goodness. If one performs good deeds day after day, why fear not living out one’s full lifespan? Thus, it is clear that people harm themselves by failing to exert effort in goodness. How can those who commit evil alone be so reckless, believing they may long share the same fate as others? Unaware, the celestial spirits hasten their descent into the earth; once buried, when shall they ever rise again? Below the earth, they are further drawn into decay, their corpses lost—such are those who receive no heavenly blessings. Can they still be counted among the living?

Each must calculate for their own body, lest they compound the suffering of future lives—this is the mark of one who is moderately good. Otherwise, they choose to be wicked, unsheltered by Heaven, unbearable to Earth. One must be cautious, avoiding transgressions and debts, to be counted among true humans. One may become a parent or child, continuing the legacy of kindness and bestowal, thereby gaining extended years, radiant essence, robust qi, and vigorous strength—all brought about by good conduct. Evil naturally declines; what is there to doubt?

From this day forward, one must carefully weigh and discern the distinction between good and evil, reflecting on which path to follow. One will then find peace, for Heaven does not oppose human actions. Yet if one repeatedly contemplates and still acts contrary to the Way, seeking long life—how can such conduct endure before the celestial spirits, the sun, moon, and stars? Would they long continue to shine? To be sheltered by the celestial spirits yet contend against them—whose fault is this? Should this not be the conduct of those who practice filial piety and goodness?

Those who possess rank and stipend, who feed from the Minister of Agriculture, who long govern the people, ensuring the proper order between high and low—these are the most honored among the people. This is the result of goodness; evil cannot preserve the body. How great is the difference? Yet when shown this text, they disregard its words, acting solely to gratify their own desires—is this not a failure of humanity?

Those who commit evil cannot transform themselves; though they possess filial piety, loyalty, sincerity, and trust, they still expect heavenly reward. When ill, they seek healing, yet their many evil deeds remain unresolved—can such a debt long be forgiven? Thus, this text is written to ensure that common folk do not resent the punishments they receive.

Those who cherish life and seek survival must not engage in evil conduct that shortens their years. Having received this text and its warnings, they should know to avoid transgressions and not provoke misfortune. If one can reform and turn to goodness, one may long abide beneath Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, equal to others—is this not goodness? Yet they recklessly disregard their lives, believing death allows rebirth. As if one who does not recognize their own evil could deem it acceptable! They wish to be equal to others in speech, clothing, and food—can this endure?

Those who fear death dare not violate these admonitions, and this too is the result of their recorded fate. If a person is even slightly decent, they should act with integrity when integrity is due—what is there to hesitate over? Each must be cautious and diligent, reflecting on the safety or peril of their actions. The warnings in this text are self-evident.

The celestial text aims to guide people toward goodness and not to hear of their evil. Thus, the records of life are incomplete—there is no great mystery in this. Reflect carefully and do not grow lax. Heaven’s register of life may be coveted, but Earth’s register of death is deeply detestable. The space between life and death cannot be compared—does one not understand this? Knowing evil, one must be cautious and take responsibility, lest even a moment be lost from one’s lifespan—how lamentable!

When speaking with others, let one’s words and deeds win their hearts. Heaven favors goodness; let no evil words escape, lest one invite blame. We share the same breath—choose words with equal care. Not even a minor unkind word may extend one’s life. Those who can contemplate the affairs of Heaven and grasp the essential words of the celestial spirits, applying these admonitions in their actions, may alter their life records, transferring them to the bureau of longevity.

Each should cultivate their conduct and rectify their actions, never forgetting Heaven’s bestowals. One should set their mind to repaying this great kindness, thereby easily changing their aspirations. Heaven, in turn, will remember and ensure they do not encounter evil. One may trust the words of this celestial text and attain governance without strife.

The text’s words are not exhaustive—choose what is practicable and act accordingly, without forcing what is not. Each must reflect on the goodness or evil of their own conduct. Heaven endows one’s nature; let there be no doubt. One should not deceive the good, nor should the wicked obtain fortune. These words are clear—what is there to doubt?

Those who become immortals never commit evil; each cherishes their life—this is proof of goodness. The text’s words are concise, reiterating the wishes of Daoists past and present, clarifying the Way of goodness and evil, urging reflection. If one disregards them, they have only themselves to blame. Those who blame themselves should know that their grievance stems from their own lack of understanding, which leads to suffering in old age—this is self-reproach.

The rest may follow their own inclinations. If one desires to cherish life, one must not commit evil. Thus, one must reflect on suffering and joy—who alone experiences joy, and who alone suffers? One must also reflect on this, avoiding resentful words and reckless speech. Let one think carefully, think of living as a good person—hence these repeated exhortations.

Let one’s words be discernible, not deviating from Heaven’s rules. When conduct aligns with the natural Dao, what cannot be accomplished? What cannot be transformed? All will welcome it—is this not the natural grace of Heaven?

Consider the foolish below who do not reflect on the great portion they have received in being born human, assuming they will long endure.

Nor should one presume there are no spirit-mediums or divine beings—cease all transgressions. The written admonitions are not singular; they recur upon reflection. Since the words bear duplicates, we set forth repeated warnings. Consider those who fail to heed the writings: let them reflect on living virtuously, for therein lies hope of survival. Those who persist in wicked, perverse speech shall be recorded without end. Take heed and desist; desist, then reflect further. If reflection leaves one unsatisfied or discontent, reason shall be expounded anew.

**Incantation One Hundred Ninety-Six**
Alas, the people of this world—each disobeys filial piety, rebels in treachery, and vies in conduct of disloyalty and faithlessness. They spurn the principle of requital, yet deem themselves fully grown, long abiding upon the earth. In all they say and teach, not even a minor good is found; only wicked words persist. They harbor no gratitude, no generosity, stealing what pleases them to act upon, never considering that suffering follows their speech. Such offspring do not belong in this world—they merit no trust, stubbornly foolish in their self-assurance of winning others’ favor. Their spoken thoughts are unworthy of adoption, difficult to take as models. They fear nothing, recklessly committing transgressions, acting as they please, heedless of their lives, blind to lasting wholeness. In their comings and goings, they repay not their parents, nor attend them morning and night, treating kin like barbarians. Who are these beings? From their very birth, they slight their peers, spurning food and drink, never clarifying the Way. They are no wiser than the six livestock, their lives and deaths without term. Their mouths crave fine flavors, their bodies fine garments—does Heaven intend to let them live long? Your conduct cannot be followed; even in death, can your ways be adopted? If you provoke Heaven’s wrath, when will it be pleased? Does it cherish your life, sparing you from death?

All your deeds offend and transgress—yet you persist in them. This is self-seeking, as if you wished to hide from Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, stars and people, all living beings. Heaven’s admonitory writings fully expound good and evil; if you disbelieve its words, where else can you turn? Do you wish to live long and breathe freely? Are you not inferior to the six livestock, birds, and beasts in understanding? Such extreme folly—how can it rely on the profound? You act frivolously, squandering all wealth, your reckless conduct inviting punishment. Devoid of reason, year after year, you neglect your household, roaming and playing without restraint. Your thoughts never turn inward—how can you endure? Though born through your parents, your conduct lacks righteousness, showing no loyalty or filial piety, no obedience, only rebellion. Does Heaven intend to preserve you, letting your eyes blink and breath continue? In death, your excess transgressions shall extend even to your unborn children.

Consider those who bring calamity: though they commit evil in life and forfeit their years, they prevent the unborn from having a fate. Their hope of living as ghosts is vain; even death cannot expiate their guilt. Is this not the consequence of evil? How can they expect to live freely? If those yet to be born resent their wrongs, why do you speak recklessly and persist in folly? Why do the people of the world not reflect on themselves, reducing their transgressions? What benefit do accumulated faults bring to a person? Only the forfeiture of life! Should this not be pondered? Why invite further disaster? This is plain to see.

In this world, those who practice filial piety and goodness attain longevity, their descendants continuing in succession, and they witness the honor of high office and abundant emolument—is this not the result of doing good and being filial? Those who commit no good and disregard future consequences are the most rebellious and wicked of men, without equal and unceasing in their ways. When your parents gave you life, did they wish to hear of your goodness, or would they rather hear ill reports and the complaints of aged kin? Brothers who hate one another never know joy; each blames the other for their faults, yet they persist in their ways and do no good—such conduct cannot long endure.

It brings no benefit to Heaven, no benefit to Earth, no benefit to man, no benefit to the brightness of the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, and stars. Such a person is utterly wicked—what hope can they have? Should they not look up in shame? Do they believe Heaven does not dispatch malevolent spirits to oversee their wrongdoing? Should they not reflect on themselves? In all they seek and do, there is nothing to rely upon; only daily decline, illness, and unending death. Why would Heaven delight in killing them? The multitudes say: "You have not a moment’s respite, so they slay you." Or they may encounter the magistrate, their wealth and property exhausted, and their grievances and misfortunes continue—is this not the result of their own conduct? Why blame Heaven and cry out in resentment?

Yet worldly people persist in this way, daring to offend Heaven again—what benefit is there in self-justification? Those who long evade the rites of sacrifice owe debts to the spirit-officials, refusing to make amends midway. What is owed must be resolved. Regularly, in the third month of spring, on an auspicious day, one should perform the rites of absolution. Three such absolutions may reduce the burden of official records, and the spirit-officials will not delight in heavily punishing men.

When official documents press upon them, passing blame up and down, how can the words of common folk prevail? Poverty and hardship bring all to a halt, leaving their deeds unfinished. In life, all consume tangible things; in death, they should consume qi, yet they do not. The ancients said: "One bears children only for the time after one’s death." Having obtained the means to consume qi alongside their peers, they yet refuse to do so. If one raises children in this manner, how can one expect descendants to long regard one another? They too shall perish, meeting the same fate as those who went before, and what shall they gain from hunger? In the celestial offices, those who are greatly filial and perform the rites with clarity need not doubt.

For three years after death, before burial, one must offer prayers and sacrifices. One cannot say, "There are unburied dead above the earth, yet no rites are performed for them." To refrain from offering is to increase transgressions and faults, bringing harm to descendants. This is plainly known—one must perform the rites. Often, in times of wealth, one indulges in extravagance, slaughtering cattle, sheep, pigs, and the six livestock for sacrifice, but the sacrificial officials grow distant. Later, one shall be held accountable, heedless of poverty. Wealth and property cannot be swiftly regained; if one’s conduct remains unworthy, wealth will not return. If one neglects the rites for long, how can the debt be swiftly resolved?

One should frequently atone for the debts of past neglect, and afterward, goodness may return, and descendants shall surely live long lives. Heaven delights in those who confess their faults. Even in impoverished households, if they partake of grain and know its savor, gathering together to bow their heads, strike their breasts, and look up in gratitude to Heaven, Heaven will take pity on their hardship. The sacrificial officials may grant them respite, allowing them to perform modest rites. The debt thus incurred is lent by Heaven; if one later acquires sufficient means, one must offer without hesitation. If one fails to do so, one shall again face the assembly of ancestors, and the sacrificial officials, resenting the neglect, shall send ghosts to escort one home, bringing unceasing illness to the living.

The ancestors shall again restrain and close the rites, and divination shall yield no answer. One must choose an auspicious day to perform them. Heaven’s grace has a term; to act within it is not amiss. One must give thanks to Heaven and Earth, summoning the bodily form into the earth, while the hun and po spirits are examined in the celestial prison, their offenses weighed and compared, death following in succession. These transgressions are too grave, so the text is set forth that all may know to accept Heaven’s punishment without complaint. They may warn one another and prevent further offenses.

Ancient writings have long existed, yet offenders never cease. For those whose coffins remain unburied, the rites must not be neglected. Now, this text is extended for those of sincere heart, that they may understand its meaning. Do not doubt its words, for one may yet be recorded in the register of the living. To doubt and fail to act is to set one’s day of death. Reflect on this yourself; do not blame Heaven or fault the Earth.

Proceed, and let the text rest briefly in your thoughts. Thereafter, ponder its words, understand what must be done, and return to the Way.

**Heaven’s Retribution is Certain: Divine Secrets, One Hundred Ninety-Seven**

Only those who advance in goodness and seek life, delighting in repayment and aligning with Heaven’s will, shall have their years extended before them. They witness the deeds that may be performed in Heaven and say: "I too shall follow Heaven’s transformative work." They see the texts on long life, altering their form and countenance, perfecting their spirit, their radiance increasing daily without cease. This is the mark of one whose heart is set on goodness, who does not forget Heaven’s grace.

For those who repay kindness, when would they ever complain? Even in the briefest moment of rest, their hearts reproach themselves, fortunate to be human and to receive guidance. Heaven’s work is fulfilled, and they come to know Heaven’s prohibitions, shunning harm and pursuing goodness, never opposing the divine. Seeing goodness, they follow it, never failing to reproach themselves and repent their errors, turning toward what is right. They reflect on their intentions, never daring to be complacent or doubtful. In their resolve to do good, they understand Heaven’s will, and all is clear—there is no room for doubt.

In self-reproach and repentance, days accumulate, and they receive blessings and protection, following Heaven’s transformative work, spared from peril. Knowing they have received Heaven’s recompense, how could they forget even for a moment, fearing the divine might reproach their words? Thus, they remain disquieted, never at ease. Eager to advance in what they say, they strive to align with Heaven’s will, fearing any lapse. Therefore, they purify their hearts and amend their conduct, moving the powers above, desiring to ascend and advance, yearning for life.

Truly, they dread the term of a short life, fearing they may long be unseen by Heaven and Earth. They exhaust their strength and devote their loyalty, pondering their sincerity. Though they often hear the words of the divine, they do not see the speakers, and their hearts are uneasy. Constantly fasting, they tremble with fear, day and night filled with dread, never daring to be at ease.

For this reason, they dare not abandon goodness to embrace evil deeds. All people receive sustenance, drawing in Heaven’s primordial *qi*, allowing them to breathe. They further understand human nature: knowing they have received Heaven’s grace and favor, they must repay and give thanks—how could there be any moment of doubt?

Heaven endows humans with essence, Earth nurtures their form, enabling them to grow and achieve maturity. Upon seeing Heaven’s scriptural admonitions and reading their words, they tremble uncontrollably—how could they speak falsely? Their hearts are constantly filled with dread and palpitation—when could they ever find peace?

Only the great spirits of Heaven, in their mercy, repeatedly examine and pardon, granting extensions of grace. Yet they know their great debt remains unpaid in due time. If only the great spirits would show compassion and allow them to remain long within the *qi* of life, extending the years of their allotted span, they would never dare forget the measure of this great bestowal. Once the grace and loan are fully repaid, they would not dare, even for a moment, to slacken or turn their backs on this favor.

Only if the great spirits fulfill this, allowing them to behold the celestial deities and converse with them, would they long to hear further admonitions. They hold Heaven’s words in the highest regard, and only when they receive recompense do they dare trust in themselves. The great spirits respond to the words of those with good hearts; the Heavenly Lord constantly cherishes such virtuous-hearted people, advancing them whenever they prove useful to Heaven.

From now on, when those with good hearts present themselves, their words shall be conveyed to the Heavenly Lord. Heed their recommendations without doubt, for they shall surely be as previously stated—this is what the Heavenly Lord himself dares to affirm. As the years and months draw near, strive to trust in Heaven’s words. Heaven, too, trusts those with good hearts, for they do not belong to the mundane world. The records in the celestial registers note their ascent into the daylight heavens—this principle is not deceptive.

The Heavenly Lord desires to advance the good, and those whose hearts do not betray their words are such people. The great spirits, even from afar, witness their conduct. Though their families may lack for a time, if they have already given their word, they need not worry. They should constantly reflect on standing before the deities of Heaven—this is the result of goodness, and they must not grow weary.

Those with good hearts say: “In life, I am no one destined for ascent. My only hope is to repay the great spirits, seeking advancement and clinging to life, exhausting all I know. How could I dare aspire to ascend in broad daylight? If selected, I am unworthy of such an honor. I fear being reproached by the great spirits, yet by their grace, I have been fortunate enough to receive favor. Though the measure of grace is fulfilled, I regret not yet having repaid this great debt in full—only the great mercy grants me respite and rest.”

Upon hearing the great spirits’ words, they compare their own intentions to those previously conveyed to the Heavenly Lord, who declares: “This is a person of good heart.” The Heavenly Lord himself wishes to draw near to them, allowing no doubt. The grace bestowed does not rest with the great spirits—why speak of repayment? They should instead clarify what they know, for there will surely be a trustworthy response. Their hearts are filled with gratitude and sincerity.

The deities will surely protect them, preventing evil spirits from interfering. They must be exceedingly cautious in their words, making goodness the foremost topic of discussion. Their written intentions must be trustworthy and mutually binding, ensuring they do not betray the words of those with good hearts who seek advancement. Heaven itself, day and night, commands its spirits to guard them—there is no cause for doubt. As for the writings that obstruct or oppose, these arise from the inherited burdens of past transgressions—do not let them be a source of worry.

Those with good hearts and aspirations say: “By nature, I am humble and lowly, long mired in the mundane world. I fear I cannot extricate myself from its midst, yet I long for the grace and favor of the great spirits, which have warmed my sincerity and self-awareness. If only the great spirits would inform the Heavenly Lord, allowing me to join the ranks of the undying—how could I dare hope for ascent in broad daylight?”

The great spirits say: “The Heavenly Lord trusts those with good hearts who seek advancement. His teachings hold no double promises, and there is no cause for doubt—this is the Heavenly Lord’s own intent. Though you may worry about your family’s insufficiency, with hunger and cold pressing in, there is the Heavenly Kitchen. Simply rely on the completion of the task, for the spirits themselves will instruct and transform your kin—do not let this weigh on your mind.”

They reply: “After receiving my allotted portion, how could I ever forget the words of the great spirits? My only concern is that I may fail to fulfill them. I dare not lose the great spirits’ pillow and mat, which remain ever in my heart and diaphragm, never slackening.”

The great spirits’ words are thus: “The Heavenly Lord knows that goodness naturally attains goodness, and those with good hearts naturally align with the Heavenly Lord’s intent.” When they previously presented their case to the Heavenly Lord, he commanded the great spirits: “I have already approved this person’s ascent. When the appointed day arrives, do not let them miss the deadline. There is a talisman clearly inscribed in their heart—let the spirits speak as a pledge, transforming it to set the date. They must only reflect on it day and night without slackening.”

They say: “After receiving this command, how could I dare grow lax? Will I truly be fulfilled?” The great spirits reply: “Once the talisman is inscribed, you will see it for yourself. Do not worry about failing to attain Heaven’s lifespan—not only the great spirits, but all deities affirm that this is a person of good heart. The deities are concerned for them; simply rely on the completion of the matter.”

They say: “This is a great weight. If my wishes are granted, I will surely devote myself wholeheartedly.” The great spirits say: “This is also what such a person should naturally embrace in their heart and express. The Heavenly Lord values their family, preventing them from falling into great transgressions, and resolving their inherited burdens. Do not trust the words of spirit-mediums or diviners—their divinations cannot alter anything. Those who wish to deliver and preserve life must rely on the true deities. Though minor spirits may be negligent, the higher powers will resolve it—do not act recklessly or inappropriately. This is known to those with hearts of goodness and the Dao.

Each must plan for themselves, trusting in Heaven’s words. Heaven does not deceive those with good hearts who seek advancement. Though they know kindness and constantly reflect, there is never a moment of forgetfulness. They hear that evil spirits descend from below, targeting those without resolve who fail to guard themselves, indulging in the extraordinary—thus, evil befalls them. They become unsettled or wicked, and their endeavors meet with no success.

This scripture does not trust evil people, nor do evil people trust this scripture. Only when its efficacy is proven and recompense received can it be truly known.”

"Now, those who have faith must recognize that the scripture for those who advance in goodness is such that the spirits themselves desire to manifest their trustworthiness. If one does not believe and put it into practice, those without the heart to advance in goodness will gain nothing. In action, the words of the scripture are already known; when trust is seen and verified, it will not be long in coming."

"How is this made clear?"
"Those who delight in life are made joyful by Heaven—this is Heaven’s trustworthy recompense. Such a person will surely transform into a spirit, ascending in broad daylight. They will no longer doubt, their days will grow lighter, and their meals will diminish. Through trust, their radiance becomes pure. Day by day, they draw closer to such a person. This trust is the clearest of clarities."

"Moreover, do not let doubt arise in your words. When you see the admonition and receive the decree, follow as it is spoken, reflect upon it, and do not dare to grow lax or forgetful. Though you may have been ignorant in the past, after witnessing it, you will grow ever closer without difference."

The great spirit said: "Good! Goodness should also be bestowed with a name. It is fitting to swiftly complete one’s work—this is the constant admonition of the spirits."

"Though the scripture’s words are weighty, the Way of life is inherently abundant."
"Do not fear it. The words will come to an end, and each will have their say."

Those with the heart and resolve to reflect replied in assent, not daring to forget.

**Decree of the Heavenly Lord of Merit, Scroll 198:**
Only those of great sincerity and faith, ancient and modern, each with proven efficacy, who accumulate merit before Heaven, dare to step forward. In movement and stillness, advance and retreat, they have never committed even the slightest transgression. They constantly harbor compassionate kindness, bestowing grace and favor, benefiting the multitude. They do not lose even the smallest trust, nor do they fail to revere Heaven and Earth, following the guidance of the four seasons and the five phases, aiding in creation and growth. They dare not harbor intentions of failure, thereby endangering themselves and causing unrest. Thus, they examine their own faults and debts, fearing they may not be resolved, and that the multitude of spirits will record them in ledgers to be reported to the Most High. For this reason, they dare to live in peace.

From ancient times to the present, goodness and evil flow in succession—when has there ever been an end? Therefore, they remain composed and tranquil, never growing lax or forgetting Heaven’s works. They merely reflect, seeking those of virtue, using their own hearts as a measure. When they see someone with a good heart, they rejoice; when they see someone with an evil heart, they tremble in fear. They imagine the heavenly spirits knowing all, each advancing accordingly.

They further reflect: originally born in the mundane world, their hearts constantly long for great transformation, coveting the Way of life and departing from the realm of death. They cherish the steadfast radiance of essence, desiring its presence within, causing self-love and peace of mind. Otherwise, they fear they will not remain among the commonly seen. Only the heavenly spirits, in their timely mercy, instruct them in advance and retreat, aligning with Heaven’s will—there must be no failure."

When even minor misdeeds reach the ears of the Supreme Sovereign, the spirits are thus entreated to inquire and examine, and by their gracious non-rejection, they are spared suspicion. Having received but a fraction of their allotted influence, they dare not forget it for even a moment. They only reflect upon their words, pondering the heavenly admonitions, to perfect their own persons and avoid falling into peril. This is the day of the spirits’ favor and grace, and they dare not rest, nor cease to contemplate repaying this profound kindness.

Before the spirits have reported to the Heavenly Lord, they learn of the dispatch and meet the attending spirit who bears the decree. They ask how the person’s conduct has wavered, thoroughly inquiring into their intentions, and the spirits question them in turn, returning to report at once. They say: this person of harmonious nature has long followed the good Way, accumulating merit over time, coveting long life. Though they modestly speak of themselves, they constantly reflect, fearing faults and transgressions, never slackening in their resolve. The spirits thus recount their merits.

The spirits then confer among themselves, saying: this person has accumulated virtue and merit, dwelling in harmony, ever mindful of repaying Heaven’s great kindness. Their good deeds have amassed over time, and though they wish to declare their merits through the spirits, they harbor doubts and dare not advance to report to the Heavenly Lord. They have long entrusted the spirits with their trust, having rendered service to Heaven, and those with merit should be advanced. Yet the spirits observe their conduct over time and wonder why they have not been reported.

The spirits, filled with apprehension, say: originally, they did not know this person’s origins, fearing their sincerity was not entirely pure. They deliberate on their intentions, uncertain whether the Heavenly Lord has heard of them. The spirits, lacking resolve, see this meritorious person yet fail to report them in due time. The messenger spirit is thus dispatched to investigate their accumulated deeds, which prove to be of great merit.

The spirits, having acted without propriety, lacking merit themselves, and harboring external intentions, assume the Heavenly Lord is unaware. They consider the spirits’ explanations—what use are they if they bring no benefit, each seeking only their own ease? The spirits apologize, recognizing their duty, removing their caps in remorse. They say: these minor spirits have served with wholehearted loyalty, yet upon inquiry, they are found guilty of impropriety, awaiting death at the gate.

The Heavenly Lord issues a decree, ordering them to wait outside while the attending spirits prostrate themselves, standing in perilous vigil. The decree commands the spirits, saying: the Heavenly Lord does not wish to punish them severely and cannot yet bear to harm them. They are to be exiled to the land of harmony, residing in the capital for ten years, selling medicine to heal the sick without accepting excessive payment. After their exile, those of higher rank shall be recorded in the Bureau of Reports; after one year of merit, they may be restored to their former positions.

The spirits, having received a pardon for their otherwise capital offense and granted only a light exile, truly recognize their faults. They are humbled, having despaired of life, yet the Heavenly Lord, unwilling to inflict harm, allows them to make amends through service. The Heavenly Lord says: "Inform the clerks of the Bureau to proceed without delay, dispatching a spirit to oversee their conduct." The clerks reply: "The dispatch shall proceed as the Heavenly Lord commands."

The Heavenly Lord instructs the clerks to inform the great spirits, showing them the documents so they may witness the decree. The clerks transmit the documents to the great spirits, who then instruct their subordinates to fulfill their duties, advancing those with merit and virtue who seek advancement. Previous matters are to be fully reported for clarity.

The Heavenly Lord commands the great spirit: "Observe this person at once and see whether their words align with the messenger spirit’s report." The great spirit replies: "Having been dispatched to observe the person, I have tallied the days and reviewed their merits, returning to report. As instructed, I have examined the meritorious person of harmony, and the report matches the messenger spirit’s words."

The Heavenly Lord, recognizing this as a person of merit whom the spirits’ subordinates failed to report in time, perceives their intent and asks: "Is this not a lack of diligence?" Having been lightly exiled to the land of harmony, from this day forward, let this serve as a warning. Those who fail to report merit shall themselves bear the punishment of exile. Each must attend to their duties, dispatching spirits to guide and transform such persons, helping them attain divinity and augment their essence and radiance. Review the registers, and for those not yet recorded above, inscribe their names.

The great spirit receives the decree and returns to the bureau, reviewing the registers to find the person’s name. They report to the clerks: "The documents contain this record; I request to examine the Heavenly Lord’s internal register to verify its correspondence." The Heavenly Lord produces the document and reviews it, finding it identical to the external record. He orders the name to be recorded above.

The great spirit asks: "I am uncertain whether their term has been fulfilled; I request to return and verify." The Heavenly Lord says: "Have you not placed your eyes and ears to observe fully, yet you ask to return and verify?" The great spirit apologizes for their duty.

The Heavenly Lord says: "Proceed swiftly with the verification." The great spirit then examines the person and finds their term already fulfilled. Their failure to report, lacking propriety, warrants punishment and awaits execution. The Heavenly Lord says: "For now, let them resume their duties and not slacken. Summon the person to ascend, ensuring they do not neglect their minor duties, knowing how to offer their merits."

"Understood. We shall follow the Heavenly Lord’s decree."

"Very well. Let the great spirit advance the person, appointing them to a minor post to observe their conduct."

"The time has been brief; I request to further assess their sincerity. If their merits are substantial and trustworthy, and a vacancy exists, they shall be appointed to fill it."

The Heavenly Lord says: "You must heed the great spirit’s report and not grow lax." The great spirit replies: "Understood. I request to dispatch a spirit to oversee their conduct." The Heavenly Lord says: "Very well."

**Scroll 199: On the Incompleteness of Life Without Written Decrees**

Only in the heavens do those of sagely wisdom hold their offices, each fulfilling their loyal conduct, never failing their superiors. Each exerts their utmost strength in their duties, never neglecting their intent. All foreknow their Heavenly Lord’s designs, ever straining to hear His will, ever examining the archives of the treasury and documents to discern His intent. When the Lord summons, there is no fixed hour—they dare not depart privately. Only on official business do they proceed, first reporting their purpose before venturing forth. Wherever they are sent, wherever they traverse, upon receiving the edict, they carry out their inspection without the slightest delay. Only after fulfilling their duties may they speak of private matters, for their sincerity is devoted to their service—they dare not act selfishly.

Those whose lives are not destined to be whole spare no day or night in self-reproach, ever fearing their usefulness may be insecure. Each governs their own conduct, striving to align with the Supreme’s intent. How could they dare grow lax, fearing they might fail in propriety? Their merits advance daily without need for spirits to urge them on. Thus they seek self-perfection, desiring long life and to serve among the heavenly spirits, great and small alike, all mutually aware. In carrying out affairs, they do not act unjustly nor presume authority, fearing suspicion. Every action is reported—when would they ever rest?

This is so because each person has their own aspirations, their own thoughts, their own accomplishments, their own calculations. Each has their own perceptions, their own origins, their own desires, their own knowledge. Their hearts are thus made clear. In these matters, life must be cherished above all—life is foremost. The rest is left to individual judgment.

The qi of life infuses the human body, and none are exempt. They guard and complete one another, and the spirits too value the attainment of their names. Transforming and emerging, entering through no aperture, they move freely, great or small. Common folk do not perceive the forms of spirits, yet spirits know one another intimately. Their forms are all composed of qi—how could they not achieve their ends?

Great spirits and lesser spirits differ in the brilliance of their essence, each according to their rank. When their lifespan increases ninefold, so too do their years. Those who enact great transformations through goodness enjoy boundless longevity—above, there is no higher; below, no lower. They enter and exit without obstruction, without outer or inner, their form like a ceaseless cycle. To halt is to halt; to move is to move. Breath becomes spirit, radiance and splendor flourish. There are appointed times for ascent and descent; when the moment arrives, they return in due course. Yet they are not entirely free, for hierarchy constrains them. Each serves the other, each has their records, their duties, their proper mindset. They uphold their resolve without deviation, illuminating their actions. Each sees their merits, each advances their knowledge, harboring no selfishness. Every move follows the teachings, never straying from the Lord’s words. They advance with unceasing diligence until the edict commands them to stop. This is the aspiration of the living spirits, and they possess talismanic transmissions as proof of their conduct.

In all their inspections, they receive provisions according to their assigned duties, never exceeding the written decrees, taking only what is allotted. The heavenly waystations have their own records—those unentitled to stay must not linger. The Heavenly Lord’s constant teaching forbids recklessness, lest the guardians of the transmissions abuse their authority. Offices have their hierarchy—none may falsely claim a higher rank to prolong their stay in the waystations. The officials receive the Heavenly Lord’s edicts and, if one overstays, report their name, rank, and affiliation without concealment or deceit. The Heavenly Lord already knows—how could they presume to act in private favor? All must adhere to impartiality. If one presumes to act without the Lord’s command, their records are frequently submitted. This results in the loss of their essence’s brilliance, their lifespan diminished—a matter well understood. They must be vigilant in their time, never daring to act on their own without heeding the Lord’s teachings.

The heavenly spirits constantly inspect and recommend one another without rest. Those who later ascend must know these prohibitions; the sagely wise do not transgress them. Fearing that later ascended ones may not see these warnings, the Heavenly Lord disseminates these texts to make the prohibitions known. This is the Heavenly Lord’s great mercy, lest any violate them. It is His desire to cultivate goodness, so He shows these texts even to common folk. Though few among them understand the harmony between Heaven and humanity, each has their own taboos.

Those who are repeatedly admonished in these texts yet refuse to reform merely wish to live out their years. If they do not desire goodness, they bring incompleteness upon themselves—how can such people persist in evil? The warnings may seem slight, yet they should be pondered for what follows. If any remain unprepared, let them reflect again.

**Great Longevity Admonition 200**

Only those of resolute will remain free from confusion. Following Heaven’s transformations, they take proper guidance as their teacher. Each is thus enabled to pursue their aspirations, fulfilling their heart’s desires.

All the myriad beings—twelve thousand in number—are born within the earth of harmony, where they grow and flourish, each returning to shelter its roots below. Their flowers and fruits sustain body and mouth, aiding the grains, offering flavors of sour, salty, tart, and bland as they please. Water is transformed into salt to season all tastes. Beans become fermented paste to enhance salt’s savor. Whether thick or thin, all vegetables and edibles that enter the mouth are provided for the people’s sustenance. Through warmth and fullness, their forms grow, their appearances flourish, and their descendants carry on. Even the six livestock unfit for labor are given to be eaten—rich, tender, sweet, and crisp—all made available for consumption.

Are these not the spirits Heaven appoints to their duties, harmonizing and balancing all things so each may follow their wishes without disturbance to their peace? Is this not Heaven’s bestowal of grace and favor upon the people? Yet how can Heaven’s gifts go unrequited? When does Heaven ever demand repayment? It is only that the common folk, having received such great kindness, fail to return thanks—thus the demand arises. Heaven feeds on the essence of qi, requiring no recompense from the people; it values only their intent. Yet they, in turn, forget the qi of Heaven that brings forth all things, allowing them to eat. Among the people, those who know yet do not repay act as if they were Heaven’s appointed agents.

The appointed agents traverse the land, commanding even the winged insects to issue decrees, urging the tillers to hasten their planting. The cuckoo calls daily, and the people heed its words. From the greatest to the least in every household, all who eat grain exhort one another day and night, scattering seeds upon the fields. Heaven makes them grow, timely rains and winds stir their branches and leaves, and their bodies swell with ripeness, ready to be harvested for human sustenance. Is not this grace profound? Year after year, when does it ever cease?

Yet they, in turn, show no filial piety, harboring rebellious hearts. What benefit do they bring to Heaven? Why does Heaven long endure such wicked and unfilial people, allowing them to see and consume its bounty? Does Heaven truly know nothing? Why should it continue to nourish the unfilial and rebellious? Thus, it assigns malevolent spirits to follow them, ensuring that the unfilial and rebellious face severe prohibitions. Their crimes bring grave misfortune, leaving no time for pardon.

Why do the people persist in such transgressions, shortening their own lives and forfeiting their allotted years? Do they not see that only the filial and good live long, bearing descendants? Good and evil must be compared: longevity and its absence stand in contrast, just as life and death are irreconcilable. Those who act with goodness and filial piety live out their years, some even gaining extended lifespans, their children and grandchildren succeeding them without premature death. Is this not the result of Heaven’s favor toward good and filial conduct? Why then do they act wickedly, inflicting harm upon others? Heaven deeply abhors such deeds, swiftly cutting short their lives and bringing misfortune to their descendants—what hope remains for such evil?

Heaven delights in the good and rejects the wicked. Let them ponder these words, for the text is complete and sufficient for self-protection, ensuring Heaven’s blessings. Why endure prolonged suffering and self-inflicted sorrow, filling the heart with grief? When grievances accumulate and remain unresolved, day and night are consumed by bitterness and sighs. Their thoughts fixate on the dispersal of wealth, fearing they cannot long preserve it. Illnesses persist year after year, confining them to bed, beyond the reach of physicians. Qi stagnates, unrelieved. As they brood, their strength wanes day and night, their appetite dwindles, and they cannot digest their food. The five viscera grow unsettled, the spleen fails to grind. This is the domain of incompleteness—shortness of breath, food unable to descend.

Their families watch, deeming them beyond recovery. Those with wealth may have some provisions left, but the penniless exhaust their property, impoverished within and without, unable to aid one another. Death arrives, yet no coffin is prepared; they are buried in the earth. Only when their heirs accumulate wealth might they be exhumed. For the impoverished, wealth departs and kin scatter—when will they reunite? Families fracture, unable to save one another. Thus, they lie without a coffin, becoming wandering ghosts without a home, with no one to offer them food. Dead and starving, they beg endlessly for sustenance.

This is the consequence of their evil deeds, yet they remain unaware, losing their clans forever. Alas, how grievous! Death leaves them with no refuge. Such are those who accumulate misfortune, bringing ruin upon their households and leaving no posterity. Heaven, too, grieves for them. Thus, a posthumous child may remain, its sex unknown. The child grows, but before reaching maturity, the mother departs to remarry. When the child is older, they ask their distant kin, “Where are my parents?” The kin reply, “Your father was young and restless, unable to settle. He followed reckless companions, neglecting his family, turning to robbery and banditry. He never ceased, and the authorities executed him in a foreign land. His wealth was exhausted, and he never returned to his hometown. For years, he wandered in distant regions; whether he lives or died, none can say.

All the households suffered his poison, and even distant kin fled. Your mother, pregnant with you, rejoiced at your birth, seeing you as a continuation. But the elders of the family had no support, impoverished and unable to sustain themselves, so they sent her to work. She followed a traveling merchant, with no set date for return.” The posthumous child laments, “All people are born dependent on their parents—why was I born without seeing mine?” As they grow older, they ask again, “Where is my father?”

People say, "Your father committed evil, abandoning his parents and wandering far away. Whether he lives or died, none can tell, and his whereabouts are unknown. Travelers passing through heard he had died, but no one knew where." His parents grieved for him, falling ill and never rising again, thus failing to live out their years. Their wealth was exhausted, their household both within and without declined, and the fault lay in our kin growing distant, having long shared no bond of kindness. I could only look to the heavens and weep bitterly, my tears soaking my robes.

Your father’s wicked deeds brought this upon himself, preventing his return. I reproached myself endlessly, finding no relief. At times, I worked as a traveling laborer, hired by wealthy households as their servant. Earning several thousand coins a year, my clothing came from this, and what little remained I saved. After more than ten years, I might have enough to return to my hometown. I longed to seek out my father, weeping day and night, with no one to rely on—how grievous the pain! Your father’s evil deeds left his child with no support, my tears flowing like a stream, never ceasing.

How great the sorrow from heaven! Yet it granted me strength, allowing me to manage my livelihood profitably, take a wife, and have descendants—only then did my heart find slight peace. I tell you again: your father committed evil, wandering far away and never returning. When travelers came and went, I hired diviners to inquire, but none could say whether he lived or died, or where he might be sought. Over the years, I worked to sustain myself. Heaven pitied the destitute, granting me profitable ventures. With some savings, I sought a wife to help manage our livelihood, and thus you were born.

I lament that your father committed evil in his youth, and so I warn you. From now on, you must only do good and not follow your father’s path, wandering far away. Reflect on my faults—heaven has pitied me. Strive to do good, avoid idleness, and manage your livelihood with order. Do not take others’ wealth; only then can you live sufficiently. Each must attend to their duties, avoid reckless drinking, and refrain from gossiping or stirring disputes, lest you suffer losses.

Ponder deeply your parents’ words, and you will avoid blame. If the heavens hear of this and deem you a good son, you may live a long and full life. I have grown old and offer this as a warning. The gods will hear and report to heaven. Heaven will send benevolent spirits to accompany you, your livelihood will prosper, your wealth will grow, your children will thrive, and you will have enough—this is heaven’s grace.

At the spring and autumn festivals and the year-end sacrifices, always offer thanks to heaven. Never cease in your efforts to do good, and you will secure your own blessings. Be cautious in speech and reflect on your actions. The heavenly spirits are always by your side—do not speak recklessly.

Beware the slightest deviation, for carelessness may cost you your life. When you see a warning, reproach yourself—do not blame others. This admonition is clear. Those who wish for great longevity must not neglect these words.

**Illness Returns to Heaven, Costly Remedies: Scroll 201**

All people dwell in the world, each with their proper path and each with their accomplishments. Let none obstruct another’s aspirations; let each find ease in what suits them. Whether in trade, farming, official service, medicine, divination, or craftsmanship, allow all to fulfill their calling. The Dao brings all to fruition, providing for the people’s needs. This is the teaching of heaven—how could any fail to succeed, ensuring their own sustenance?

Remember always to follow heaven’s way, to bestow kindness and share bounty, and to offer pure and unceasing sacrifices in return for the four seasons. This is how one repays heaven’s grace. If you persist in good deeds, the spirits will cherish you, for such conduct brings its own reward—how could it not be favored? Thus, heaven ever watches from above, judging human deeds, sending spirits to observe all actions. Good and evil are promptly reported—nothing is missed.

Those who doubt this should know that heaven reveals its signs through echoes and omens, making its will heard. The timing of wind and rain is made known—what room is there for doubt? Actions yield distinct outcomes, and written records preserve the law without fail. How can one remain ignorant and act wantonly, defying heaven?

Heaven, born of the primordial qi, naturally follows its own decrees. None dare even slightly disobey, fearing loss and the people’s undoing. Those who violate heavenly law, heedless of its snares, invite heaven’s reproof. To live long, you must be counted among the good. How can one presume to act as they please?

Thus, spirits follow the wicked, recording their misdeeds and reporting every transgression, great or small, to heaven. These are human failings—why blame the heavenly records? The texts contain warnings, yet if one ignores them, falls ill, and panics, how can they escape? Truly, people are foolish—what benefit do they bring to heaven? They weary the spirits with their troubles, and physicians and shamans labor to heal them.

If you seek life, do not forget your past transgressions. When you acted wrongly, why did you not immediately repent? Only when illness strikes do you beg for survival—by then, death often follows. Some pray and sacrifice to spirits: minor offenses may be absolved, but grave ones are not forgiven. Instead, they summon more spirits, calling them deceitful illness-demons, prostrating and striking themselves, pleading for life with countless petitions. Yet their names are already inscribed in death’s ledger—how can they escape?

Physicians, shamans, and spirit-mediums, eager for payment, claim the illness can be cured. They demand rich offerings, fine meats, and wine, invoking mighty spirits to intercede and spare your life. But if your name is not destined to be removed, your wealth will be exhausted, and you will still lose your life. If the spirits’ entreaties fail thrice, the illness will not improve—why persist? Disaster will only bring further disaster, and retribution will follow.

False spirits masquerade as true ones, slaughtering recklessly, killing the undeserving. Their crimes and grievances ascend to heaven, where the Heavenly Lord judges them. Those who serve such spirits—even their descendants suffer, seeking blessings for the sick. Hoping to secure life, they invoke spirits improperly and instead invite calamity.

Those who serve false spirits claim, *"Our spirits are true!"*—but what false spirit or demon would dare stand before the Heavenly Lord to intercede for others? They merely consume the people’s offerings—wine, millet, dates—and when illness strikes, they blame the false spirits’ households. If recovery occurs, it is because the person was not yet marked for death. If the transgression has not been recorded above, they may be spared—this is heaven’s doing, not the false spirits’ merit. Yet they boast of healing many, demanding rich rewards.

When false spirits are exposed, they are summoned for judgment, their hidden crimes examined. If their sins are many and grave, they will not survive. Those who serve spirits but fail to attract them, whose conduct is unworthy, will see their vitality wane—this is the retribution of false spirits. Spirit-mediums take the remnants of false spirits’ offerings to feed their families, wearing fine clothes, believing their prosperity will last. But spirits will punish them—how can they hope for long life?

Those who accept many spirit-offerings cannot be absolved; their descendants will perish. They blame others, saying, *"You killed my descendants!"*—yet they themselves may face extinction. People should correct themselves—why blame heaven?

Today’s people are foolish and shallow. When illness strikes and death looms, they do not turn to heaven, confess their faults, and prostrate themselves. Instead, their entire household, young and old, joins in desperate pleas. After days of this, heaven may pardon them, granting time to recover. But if they repeat their offenses, prostration is futile. This is plain to see.

Strive to do good, avoid forbidden acts, and you may live out your full span. If you refuse goodness, you invite a short life, choosing to become a ghost, scorning life itself—what can be done? Be cautious in speech, delight in understanding the rest.

Reflect on your actions; do not act unjustly. When ill, turn to heaven. This will save resources and spare you great trouble. Do not flee your home in panic, seeking distant refuge. What good is fleeing for one fated to die? Malevolent spirits will follow—can you truly escape? Fools act thus, yet how can they secure a place among the living? Avoidance does not kill—it only brings ruin to the household.

Heavenly spirits watch from above—what fate do you seek? Do you not know your place? Be mindful of your words. Heaven loves humanity and desires life—when has it ever wished to harm or kill? It sets prohibitions only to prevent transgressions.

Yet when one violates them oneself, how can life be prolonged? Ponder this deeply, again and again, and recall the words of the scriptures—let no doubt remain. When the scriptures briefly pause, pause and reflect; then, when the spoken Way resumes, follow its discourse once more.

**Second Hundred and Twenty Admonitions on Resolving Illness and Removing Heaven’s Reproof**

Consider the people of the world—how utterly foolish they are. They neglect filial piety and loyalty, turning instead to rebellion. They disregard the great scriptures, recklessly belittling themselves. Toward others, they show no kindness, while their misdeeds spread far and wide. Those who dwell in such ways invite disaster; those in their midst decline; those beneath them fall ill, never to recover. This is the evil they inflict upon others, ensuring their own guilt cannot be absolved, for they harbor no intent to bestow mercy. Day and night, they assail and undermine the good, provoking resentment and offering no benevolence in return. Instead, they incite themselves, entrapping others in accusations, subjecting them to punishment—even death—while severing their own masters’ protection.

Wealthy households may extricate themselves from trouble through drink. The penniless, however, violate the law, summoning officials to be summoned in turn, exhausting their resources to secure release. All their possessions are tallied and valued, then used to buy their freedom. Half remains for their family’s sustenance, while fine wine and choice delicacies are indulged at will. They deem this acceptable, unaware that others observe and resent their wickedness. They assume their ways endure, equal to all others.

When a county magistrate is stern, he dispatches officers to surveil. Those who seek merit report in kind. Day and night, they monitor, eager to uncover wrongdoing. They note who among the idle and dissolute frequents which doors, slipping in secret missives bearing names. The officials, corrupted, act as intermediaries, relaying faults and merits. With rich food and fine wine ever before their eyes, they remain vigilant. The magistrate, receiving the missives, summons the accused in silence, presenting evidence to silence their denials. Once guilt is determined, they are sent to prison, tortured to confess their crimes. If others speak against them, their punishment is compounded. Such is the fate they hear—and such is their own.

Wealth in trifling matters—failing to strive for self-improvement and secure one’s livelihood, yet turning to sell one’s tongue against others, entrapping them in accusations—this is true malice. How can one hope for long life? When high officials despise you, ensuring you cannot survive, whose fault is it? All stems from the depravity of wicked men. Parents grieve in bitterness, clans suffer poisonous harm. Behaving thus, what can one expect but to forfeit the hope of prolonged breath?

To invite calamity and punishment, yet still seek life—what manner of person is this? Heaven gazes down from above, declaring such deeds intolerable for long. Below, it dispatches officials to the bureau of malevolence, sending clerks to ally with evil spirits, aiding the county magistrate in punishing the lawless, driving them into the statutes of death, leaving no hope of survival. All this for greed—not the wealth of one household, but to augment their own gain at others’ expense. Only when guilt is fixed and death assured do they cease. No heirs remain to offer sacrifices, leaving the departed unhonored at ancestral rites. This is your fault alone.

From now on, let later generations take warning and desist, if only to eke out brief survival. Otherwise, they shall surely join the ranks of the dead, without doubt. Take heed in even slight matters, and you may avoid mutual resentment. Life cannot be regained once lost. All men are the same—why defy the prohibitions?

The lawless band together, forming gangs to rob others of their wealth. Their masters remain unscathed, and the magistrate has yet to execute them. Yet Heaven enacts its own punishment, annihilating households from above and cursing descendants below. For the sake of such wealth, they forfeit life—how is this calculation not wholly corrupt? Thus, these writings are issued repeatedly, valuing only that men refrain from transgression. Yet those who persist in the worst offenses cause many deaths, incurring Heaven’s deep displeasure.

Those with discernment, seeing such men, naturally avoid their crimes. But the people of this age are utterly benighted. They read these longevity texts yet disregard their words, dismissing them as untrustworthy. They do not see that those who attain immortality do so through filial piety and goodness—how boundless is their longevity! Carefully consider these words, for they share a common purpose: let good deeds flourish, and evil befall its authors. The warnings inscribed before and after aim but to guide men toward goodness and away from lawbreaking. When have they ever wronged you?

You ought to ponder deeply and engrave these admonitions within, making them your guide, lest you offend Heaven. To offend brings no benefit—only compounding your transgressions. Take care not to harbor resentment; your actions yield their own consequences. What cause for blame is there? Strive for goodness, and you may yet be called human. Act with self-regard, lest you incur the reproach of spirits. Do you not understand?

Each must weigh their own reckoning, avoiding the pursuit of wrongdoing, for death is insufficient to absolve guilt. Those to whom misfortune accrues are many; when will the cycle of hatred and resentment end? A guarded heart is essential—empty words are of no use. The affairs of this world bring only sorrow and bitterness. Why persist in provocation, when harmony might prevail?

To deem oneself virtuous and seek to reform others, only to prove oneself base—this is no standard to uphold. Born alike as humans, yet lacking insight, when questioned, they offer no clarity of purpose. Such men are no better than livestock. Their mouths know only foulness, yet they don fine robes and feign propriety. Their bowing and rising follow no proper model, their hearts ever harboring irreverence. Seeing elderly neighbors, they stand in arrogance; encountering women, they gossip, ranking their beauty or ugliness. These are evil men, fit for no honest labor.

They scheme and contrive, their mouths spewing curses, denying the gods of the earth. They incriminate one another, acting as they please, heedless of the coming retribution. Too late to save themselves, their aid arrives only when disaster has struck—what use is it then? Their pettiness and harshness will ultimately be laid bare. How can they justify themselves, absolve their debts? Condemned by the many, their misdeeds unceasing, they bring ruin upon their households, leaving no descendants, their lifespans cut short. Pitiable are such deeds—how can they endure?

The *Scripture of Great Peace* commands that inferiors obey their superiors, ensuring longevity. Disobedience forfeits life and invites ungovernable chaos. Yet the people of this age are ungrateful, lacking in principle. They indulge their immediate desires, heedless of their own lives. Unrestrained and self-willed, they deny the existence of spirits. Those who slight them are many, their affairs ever entangled. When the Hall of Light is consulted, past and present deeds are collated, names recorded, and the responsible officials take note. If debts or transgressions are found, they report to the supervising authority, who in turn informs the Bureau of Grand Darkness. The clerks of Grand Darkness summon the ancestors of the household, interrogating and torturing them. They compel the accused to return home and confess their curses, evasions, and misdeeds, which know no end, thus afflicting them with illness.

The afflicted household must perform rites to absolve the yin transgressions and misfortunes, halting their recurrence. If the absolution succeeds, the illness ceases; if not, the punishment persists, and the affliction continues. Having failed to absolve themselves, they dismiss the matter as false. Yet observe their conduct—such men exist in abundance, differing only in degree. This is plain to see. Beware henceforth, lest you compound your guilt. With awareness, you may avoid fault. Without it, you remain trapped between misfortune and blessing, never at rest.

Heed these words carefully. Do not betray one another, for the gods never cease their reckoning. To feign ignorance of others’ deeds is itself an evil. Good begets good; evil forfeits longevity. Why harbor resentment when you reap what you sow? Obey your superiors, and you shall have no wicked sons. Do you not understand? Take warning, take warning—let there be some respite.

The text is difficult to compose, its statutes and ordinances expansive. It is meant only to ensure you refrain from transgression. Some passages are brief, others less definitive. Ponder their implications, and let their meaning be clear. Take heed, take heed—small matters lead to great consequences.

The text is repetitive, so let a brief respite follow. After this pause, more words shall be set forth.

**On the Unyielding Duty of Parents (Section 203)**
Only those who walk in virtue transgress neither the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, nor the taboos of the four seasons, five phases, sun, moon, stars, and all spirits. Fearing the consequences of violation, they inscribe their names above, thereby resolving to cultivate goodness and filial piety.

The celestial prohibitions are not meant to constrain the people but to ensure their flourishing. When all living things are nurtured and fed, why would Heaven wish them harm? It is man who brings ruin upon himself.

Thus, the virtuous speak no ill, for each precept and its fulfillment is plainly recorded. Goodness begets life; evil hastens death—what quarrel is there with fate? Therefore, the writings of the good are set forth to instruct the people, that they may know the origins of fortune and misfortune, follow the Way of admonition, and avoid transgression.

Those who do good encounter no harsh words. Heaven sees their virtue and commands spirits to attend them, altering their fate in the registers of destiny, transferring them to the ranks of the long-lived. Their merit is thus secured. Future generations, born under the auspices of virtuous days, shall face no omens or taboos below. The surplus years of their ancestors are added to their own, granting them a lifespan of one hundred and twenty.

Their descendants, inheriting this goodness, shall know no minor faults and likewise enjoy long life, their white hairs succeeding one another. Generation upon generation, their households shall be abundant, their members complete, and none shall encroach upon them. Whether tilling the land or trading in markets, all shall prosper. Entering officialdom, they shall rise through the ranks, untouched by punishment, for goodness is their guardian.

Yet some, unable to emulate such conduct, mock it instead. The heart of the virtuous remains steadfast in goodness, ever benefiting others. When they see others in distress, they lend aid without demanding repayment or interest. Those who receive their kindness shall never betray them. Even a small repayment—wine and meat in gratitude—shall bind both parties in mutual favor.

Heaven observes their deeds and blesses them further, ensuring their comings and goings are free from harm. The virtuous are aided by Heaven itself, spared from encountering evil—such is the fruit of their conduct.

As for those who do evil yet hope to live long and leave descendants, they fail to discern the natural order. Heaven distinguishes their lifespans, for only those who align their hearts with the Way of Heaven and perform celestial deeds may attain immortal records, their spirits ascending to the ranks of the sagely. What limit could there be to their longevity?

Thus, goodness must not be neglected, for it is beyond the reach of most. Heaven cherishes the virtuous and desires no evil for them. The good and the wicked occupy separate realms—how could they share the same fate? The celestial writings make this clear: the good are rewarded, the wicked admonished, lest they fall into peril and forfeit their years.

Heaven repays goodness by lengthening life and dooms the wicked to fail in their humanity—this is plain to see. Why harbor doubt? From birth to old age, each person begets descendants, raising them to maturity. Let them follow their inclinations and live in peace, never opposing their wills, that each may find their proper place and fulfill their desires.

To be a parent is no easy task. Children, in turn, must be filial, heeding their parents’ teachings. The virtuous preserve the integrity of their limbs and bones, keeping them whole. What parents give, they must not mar with injury or punishment. They dare not answer back but offer only what is fine. If the household lacks wealth, let them be reverent, gentle, and tender, frequently inquiring after their parents’ well-being to know their safety—this is the highest goodness.

Neighbors and close kin should be treated with love and respect, completing the work of virtue. When encountering the wicked, one must not engage in speech, lest conflict arise. Once discord erupts, the virtuous are blamed for the wicked’s faults, and Heaven grows resentful. Thus, all must cherish themselves and their descendants, avoiding transgressions that unsettle the household. Such unrest does not stop there but extends to kin near and far, disrupting all within.

If they then face official scrutiny, their wealth and property shall dwindle. Therefore, let them be cautious and never violate the written precepts. Let them foster harmony and unity, free from duplicity. Each shall have their calling and fulfill their duties—this is the conduct of the truly virtuous. Heaven shall grant them long life, and spirits and ghosts shall protect them, never failing in their duty.

The offerings to the four seasons shall be presented in proper order. In markets, let them choose the finest goods without haggling over prices. Why? Because all offerings possess spirit, ascending or descending in accord with their quality. Even slight impurities shall be recorded, incurring no loss. Thus, let them conduct their trade and travel with reverence, and the spirits shall rejoice. They shall report to the Controller of Destinies, and the officials of the altars and bureaus shall proceed in peace.

If they personally present offerings of purity and fragrance, partaking in the feast afterward, they shall make grand offerings to the Five Ancestors at the proper place, and all shall eat with joy. Their households shall grow prosperous, their descendants virtuous, free from wicked children. The commanderies and counties shall hear of them and summon them to office. They shall ascend to the prefecture, where prominent posts await.

When the province learns of them, it shall recruit them as trusted aides, recommending them for excellence and talent—such is the reward of goodness. Their positions shall rise of their own accord, for this is the natural course of their allotted fate. The signs of their virtue are clear, and evil shall not cross their threshold.

All the spirits of Heaven shall declare their conduct most excellent—only the will of Heaven remains unknown. Thus, the virtuous writings of the good are inscribed on bamboo and silk, that future generations may be inspired to emulate virtuous households, securing honor for their descendants, who shall never depart from the halls of power. Emperors shall cherish them, keeping them in positions of goodness.

This merit arises naturally, born of their own blessings. Therefore, those who would do good must take this text as their model, for its words are proven true, not empty speech.

The Right [Section] states: "Filial piety halts rebellion, repels the barbarians, and makes those below obedient and easy to govern."

*From the *Three Caverns Pearl Satchel*, Scroll 3, citing the *Scripture of Great Peace* 114:*
The Azure Lad gathers flying roots, swallows solar radiance, and ingests the Luminous Spirit Talisman. He takes the Lunar Essence Talisman, the Dual-Expelling Talismans, binds the Three Hun, restrains the Seven Po, and wears the Starry Symbol Talisman. He consumes Radiant Cinnabar, Yellow Fluid, and Returning Water; eats Ringed Steel, Phoenix Brain, Pine Pears, and Plum Jujubes; adorns himself with white silver and purple gold; ingests Cloud Fat; eats bamboo shoots; and bears the Five Spirit Talismans. Thus equipped, his transformations become boundless, transcending beyond the Three Realms and roaming freely within the Six Directions.

*From the *Upper Clarity Compendium of Daoist Rituals and Matters*, Scroll 3, "Treasure Terrace" Chapter, citing the *Scripture of Great Peace* 114:*
Within it, the Supreme Luminous Terrace is governed by Grand Master Peng Guangyuan.

It further states:
The Great Void Jade Terrace is where the Lord of the Great Peace Dao resides.

The Two Hundred and Fourth Formula (preceding text originally missing):

When hearts and intentions align, all becomes great joy. When hearts diverge and intentions clash, all becomes discord and error, giving rise to bitter qi. What need is there for song and dance to call it joy? All voices in harmony suffice. What need is there for strife and conflict to call it suffering? All manner of misfortune arising together suffices.

Mutual joy serves to suppress and sever punishment. Mutual sorrow and suffering serve to invite rebellion. What then is meant by harmonious alignment of hearts? Whenever people, great or small, share the same intention, there must be joy—how could it be otherwise? One ought to refine and examine this intention further. The Supreme Master of the Celestial August Cavern of Utmost Peace, speaking for Heaven, adds these words to further resolve its meaning.

Yet if one does not yet fully grasp the heart and intention of Heaven and Earth—something beneficial to the governance of the Emperor—then one ought to follow and employ the heart and intention of Heaven and Earth. One must not go against the Great Year or the various spirits, but rather unite and harmonize their qi with the affairs of the Emperor. Share the same joy, the same heart, the same direction, the same path, the same movement, the same pivot, the same root, and the same intention.

Thus, the sages of old established laws for the Emperor: in spring, the east; in summer, the south; in autumn, the west; in winter, the north. This is to act in concert with the qi of Heaven, for when qi is aligned, it naturally responds. This is what is meant by "carefully following the Dao of Heaven and sharing its qi." Thus, succession and compliance bring mutual joy. What is meant by "harmony and unity" is mutual joy. When there is mutual joy, Heaven and Earth remain perpetually pleased, without strife or anger. Without strife or anger, disasters, calamities, treachery, and all manner of evil vanish entirely. When evil people are eradicated, balanced qi arises. The balanced qi of Heaven descends to govern below, while the balanced qi of Earth ascends to assist above.

If, however, one does not follow and employ the qi that the August Emperor of Heaven and the Earth Goddess follow and employ, but instead neglects and abandons it, all will fall into error and rebellion—rebelling against the Dao of Heaven and Earth, rebelling against the qi of the Emperor, and diverging from the intentions of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth will grow wrathful, myriad transformations will arise together, treachery and evil will flourish daily, leading to instability and imbalance. Ominous years and baleful qi will come—one must deeply understand this.

"Excellent! Excellent! This foolish student has heard your command."

"Is this clear? When Heaven rejoices, the Perfected One must be cautious."
"Yes, yes. I shall carefully record this and dare not forget. Excellent! Excellent! Since the Heavenly Illuminated Master has gone to such lengths, I wish to hear how this applies to spring, summer, autumn, and winter."
"All must follow their qi according to their proper measures. Only the sixth month, beginning on the day of the Summer Solstice, activates the *gong* tone, encompassing the entire fifth month. The sixth month is purely the *gong* tone. Moreover, when music arises, it manifests in song and dance. The kingly qi should be stirred—stirring reveals the joy of mutual accord and the assistance of offerings. The qi of rest, imprisonment, and death all desire stillness; they do not wish to be stirred. If stirred, they grow displeased and wrathful, and wrath gives rise to treachery, evil, and calamity. This is the natural pattern of Heaven and Earth—never deviating even once."
"Which qi should be stirred? I wish to hear this as a principle, that I may not oppose even a single qi."
"One must first stir the Emperor’s qi, then the kingly qi, then the ministerial qi, then the seasonal qi, and finally the subtle qi. These qi all advance before the Celestial Dipper each day, desiring to be roused and invigorated—thus they are stirred. The remaining qi lie behind the Celestial Dipper. What Heaven turns away from, its qi daily wanes, and thus should not be stirred. To act contrary to Heaven and oppose Earth is to defy the will of Heaven and Earth—hence, misfortune arises. Therefore, what Heaven favors must be invigorated, and what Heaven rejects must be abandoned. This is how one knows the seasonal qi, and from this, good and ill fortune, safety and peril, may be discerned."
"I ask: if only the five tones are stirred, and they are insufficient to form a complete song or dance, what then?"
"Excellent question! Simply begin by stirring. For in the interplay of yin and yang, movement produces sound. Thus, when music stirs, it always arises with sound. Yang has sound: the first is *gong*, the third *zhi*, the fifth *yu*, the seventh *shang*, and the ninth *jiao*. But the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth are not named tones. The punitive and the Greater Yin lack sound when activated—hence, they harm others with their lesser aspect. This is what it means to act without sound."
"Why then does the military advisor have sound?"
"Another excellent question! Indeed, the noble one’s military advisor has sound, but it is merely the prelude to music—there is no intent to harm. Only when wrath erupts and harm is imminent does sound arise from within, and no further words are exchanged. Do you understand?"
"Yes, yes."

"Truly so—now even the foolish and ignorant have awakened to this."

"Thus, the sages of antiquity, when preparing to employ music, would carry it on the left; when preparing to employ punishment, they would carry it on the right. Auspicious affairs honor the left, inauspicious affairs honor the right. The left pertains to yang, the right to yin. This is to say, each follows its own kind."

"Excellent! Excellent indeed!"

"Therefore, in my affairs of culture, I follow Heaven in intent and Earth in principle. Those who comply with this will find fortune and prosperity; those who defy it will meet misfortune. If one’s intent differs from Heaven, what else can be hoped for? Thus, Heaven possesses three qi: the upper qi is called *music*, the middle qi is called *harmony*, and the lower qi is called *punishment*. Music belongs to yang, punishment to yin, and harmony to the center. Therefore, the southeast—yang and music—favors life, while the northwest—yin and wrath—favors killing. The qi of harmony follows and circulates between them. It conceals and reveals itself, governing the avoidance of harm. Thus, music should only be used for auspicious affairs and matters of life; it must not be used for inauspicious affairs or matters of death. Heaven’s pattern and law are thus—it cannot be reversed. O true one, heed my words with care."

"Yes, yes."

"Now, in speaking of tones, you have only discussed one *jia*—this is far from exhaustive. How then should the rest be expressed so that all their correspondences may be fully known?"

"Indeed. One ought to collate the writings of sages and worthies, arranging them by school and category, so that their entries and exits, ascents and descents, great and small, all align without fail. From one, infer ten; from ten, infer a hundred; from a hundred, a thousand; from a thousand, ten thousand; from ten thousand, the boundless. When the many worthies deliberate together, nothing will be left ungrasped. Thus, I merely present the beginning for you and do not exhaust every detail. The superior person, upon seeing my text, will naturally grasp its meaning in full; the middling person, upon seeing it, may yet aspire to rise to that level; the petty person, upon seeing it, may take it as a model and act accordingly. Without transgressing the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, each may cultivate good intentions of their own. To expound everything at once would only dazzle and confuse with excess, losing the guiding principles and rendering the text chaotic and hard to govern. Therefore, one should only reveal the beginning and allow them to ponder it themselves."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Go now. My discourse on this minor matter is concluded; if you have further doubts, return again."

"Yes, yes. May I ask: regarding the harmony of tones, can one know whether its intent is attained or not?"

"Indeed, it can be known. The *qi* of emperors and kings depends on their celestial numbers. When the *qi* of an emperor or king prevails, the sound of their teachings and commands issues forth first—this is like an emperor or king first issuing proclamations to the world, whereupon all people and things follow in obedience, and the world attains peace. If any dare disobey, it is rebellion, and they will die. Thus, when the *qi* of the emperor or king is first emitted, all else follows."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"If, however, the *qi* of the emperor or king is not emitted first, and instead the *qi* of *xiu* or *qiu* is activated prematurely, forcing the *qi* of the emperor or king to follow, this is a grave act of rebellion. Such is the pattern and law of Heaven and Earth—it cannot be forced. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes."

"Moreover, the five tones each have their own correspondences: some draw upon Heaven, some upon Earth, some upon the sun, moon, and stars, some upon the four seasons and five phases, some upon mountains and rivers, and some upon the people and the myriad things. When a tone is activated, all that it moves will be stirred, each yielding its own effects. Thus, when harmony is achieved and its intent is grasped, good is brought forth; when its intent is not grasped, evil arises. When tones are activated, the spirits of all things first come to pay homage before any movement occurs, revealing their forms. Therefore, when activating musical tones, one must always understand the matter at hand, carefully grasp its intent, and thereby bring about great peace, dispelling inauspicious *qi*. True one, consider this well."

"Yes, yes. May I ask: how do musical tones activate and draw forth their correspondences?"

"Excellent! Your question strikes at the essential meaning. Consider this: in spring, the first movement begins with the great horn string activating *jia*. When the *jia* day ascends, it draws forth Jupiter; when the Heart Star descends, it draws forth the Eastern Marchmount. The *qi* stirs the lesser yang, the tone stirs the phase of Wood, the spirit stirs Gou Mang, the creature stirs the Azure Dragon, the position draws forth the Green Emperor, and the spirits summon the green-robed jade maidens. From the highest to the lowest, all come to pay homage in kind, delighting in the musical tone. By explaining one to seek its kind, the possibilities are endless. Examine the essential meaning with care, and you will grasp it all. Align it with ordinary texts and writings to form a model. Thus, in music, those who grasp its highest intent may transcend the world; those who grasp its middling intent may bring about peace and eliminate misfortune; those who grasp its lowest intent may bring joy to people. Those who attain its highest intent may bring joy to the spirits; those who attain its middling intent may bring joy to the essences; those who attain its lowest intent may bring joy to the body. When all grasp its intent, emperors and kings may wander without cares, music arises and punishments cease, and spirits and essences are satiated."

"I wish to hear the secret of how music arises and punishments cease."

"Excellent, your words are apt. Now, music is the essence of the great yang; punishment is the essence of the great yin. When yang flourishes, yin submits; when yin flourishes, yang submits. Thus, when music flourishes, punishments vanish. Why is music yang and punishment yin? When tones are harmonious, their direction is harmonious and good; when tones are disharmonious, their direction is inauspicious and evil. At the proper time, listen carefully to the tones. Those who know tones know all matters of good and ill fortune; those who do not know tones cannot know these things either. Yang moves and has sound; yin is silent. Thus, punishments often harm through yin. The sages of old, when following music, aligned with the intent of Heaven and Earth. Those who comply meet good fortune; those who defy meet misfortune. Thus, Heaven possesses three *qi*: the upper *qi* is called *music*, the middle *qi* is called *harmony*, and the lower *qi* is called *punishment*. Music belongs to yang, punishment to yin, and harmony to the center. Therefore, the southeast—yang—favors life, while the northwest—yin—favors killing. The *qi* of harmony follows and circulates between them, concealing and revealing itself to govern the avoidance of harm. Tones are the speech of music. Whether divining near or far, all must be aligned. The day, hour, surname, and given name, the divisions of boundaries, the waxing and waning of influences—all are taken together to form the discourse. Those with keen perception will hear without error."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"May I ask how music is used to dispel disasters, treachery, and malevolence, modeling the numbers after the patterns of Heaven and Earth? Should the Emperor, adjusting to dawn or dusk, shake the musical instruments and begin the chant to dissolve the *qi* of sorrow and suffering, thereby bringing about great peace?"

"Excellent is your inquiry into the method—how truly refined! Does the August Heaven, long afflicted by disasters, pity the Emperor’s sorrows and send a Perfected One to resolve all doubts? Very well, very well. Be seated, for I dare not conceal anything. To hide the truth would risk Heaven’s censure, subjecting me to prolonged and heavy punishment, shortening my celestial years. Sit calmly and listen closely, as I shall distinguish and explain its profound meaning for you.

The Dao of Heaven is like a cycle, ever revolving and returning to its beginning. When music arises, it must be applied in accordance with the *qi* of the ruling phase, aligning with the position of the Dipper’s handle. The sound resonates in the direction it points, and the tones are activated. People may chant along, each using their own pitch. The numbers follow the six *jia* stems and the five phases. The five and six of *jia* and the five phases—these are the numbers of Heaven and Earth. The *qi* of the seasons is what Heaven and Earth respond to and act upon.

For example, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), when the Dipper points to *yin*, it is called the time of the Supreme Thearch. First, the great horn is sounded. At the midpoint of the month, when it aligns with *jia*, in the second month when the Dipper points to *mao*, and at the midpoint with *yi*, in the third month when it points to *chen*—proceed likewise for the rest. Each follows the *qi* of its season, adjusting for dawn or dusk in its measures.

First, sound the Emperor’s tone and the Emperor’s string; next, the King’s tone and the King’s string; then the Minister’s tone and the Minister’s string; then the Candidate’s tone and the Candidate’s string; and finally, the *zhi* tone and the *zhi* string, each in their proper sequence. This is called ‘receiving Heaven’s teaching and aligning with Earth’s *qi*.’ If Heaven and Earth themselves delight in and employ it, how much more so for humans? Humans are the most honored of all beings, the children of Heaven. When people reverently and respectfully apply these numbers, Heaven delights in them; when they act with caution and compliance, Earth delights in them. This is like a filial child following the teachings of their parents—how could the parents not love and favor them?

Now, Heaven has sent you to ask these questions. As I serve as Heaven’s spokesperson, charged with establishing the numbers for great peace above, I dare not omit anything. I fear the censure of Heaven and Earth and dare not deceive the Perfected Ones or conceal anything. Only when not asked do I remain silent; when questioned, I speak. Seeing the Perfected One inquire so earnestly, I know Heaven wishes to communicate, so I explain it fully for you. If you grasp this Dao, ponder its meaning deeply and transmit it to later generations, so they may model it and thereby dispel all manner of disasters. Above, this will pacify the *qi* of Heaven and Earth; below, it will assist the Emperor in governance. It will settle the hearts of all people, preventing them from straying into wrongdoing, and allow the twelve thousand beings to each find their proper place. Is this not joyous indeed?"

"Great indeed! Great indeed!"

"The Perfected Ones may truly be said to understand."

"May I ask about the affairs of the six caves and eight directions—what is most auspicious and good, and what is most inauspicious and evil?"

"Excellent is your inquiry. Listen closely, and I shall explain its meaning. What is most harmonious and joyful is good and auspicious; what is most contrary and sorrowful is inauspicious and evil.

Harmony and joy produce good sounds; opposition and sorrow produce inauspicious sounds. Thus, music is joy alone. Harmonious joy is good joy, and only in auspicious matters may music be made. In inauspicious matters, there must be no music; if there is, it is called ‘joy,’ but misfortune will multiply.

Therefore, when the *qi* of the Emperor, the King, or the subtle *qi* aligns with the Dipper’s position, it is auspicious. What Heaven and Earth delight in, they wish to bring forth; what they share, they employ together. Thus, one should rejoice in, comply with, and prosper such times. The *qi* of decline and desolation is what Heaven and Earth jointly abandon and weaken, so it should be set aside and not celebrated with music. To make music against the will of Heaven and Earth is called ‘great rebellion,’ failing to align with the *qi* of the seasons. The *qi* of the seasons is the proper *qi* of Heaven.

Heaven and Earth take this as their model: the *qi* of prosperity and ascendancy governs great peace, while the *qi* of imprisonment, desolation, and severance governs inauspicious years. The *qi* of prosperity and ascendancy generates much life and many good things. Thus, in years of great peace, all things flourish, and good things abound—this is clear evidence, the great effect of Heaven and Earth. The signs of Heaven and Earth’s delight in goodness extend to the people and the myriad beings; this is the great proof and verification.

Thus, the sages and worthies of old deeply examined and compared themselves, knowing the success or failure of their conduct. They clearly understood how to compare like kinds, like affairs, and like *qi*. When they obtained the image of a like *qi* or kind, they would reform their nature and change their conduct, daring not to do wrong. The language of Heaven and Earth is revealed through these effects, not through direct speech. By observing the images and kinds obtained, one may know for themselves.

The *qi* of imprisonment, desolation, death, and severance generates little and accomplishes no good. Thus, in inauspicious years, little is born, no good responses occur, and no good things appear—this is their shared affair and shared *qi*. Therefore, those who would bring about great peace may fully employ music, for music aligns with and delights in the *qi* of prosperity, bringing balance. But in years of misfortune, one must not make music or initiate it without cause. The *qi* of imprisonment and desolation opposes Heaven and Earth, so in inauspicious years and matters, music must not be made.

Thus, the *qi* of prosperity and ascendancy is where virtue resides; the *qi* of imprisonment and desolation is where punishment resides.

In inauspicious years, there are few good responses. Therefore, those who would bring about great peace must align their music with the *qi* of prosperity. In inauspicious years, music must not be made without cause, for the *qi* of imprisonment and desolation opposes Heaven and Earth—hence, misfortune. The *qi* of prosperity is where virtue resides; imprisonment and desolation are where punishment resides."

Thus, a ruler of virtue who cherishes life is enabled by Heaven to make music; a ruler without virtue is not permitted to make music. This is the clear evidence of Heaven. Does the Perfected One understand this?

"Indeed, indeed. How profound! Today, having fully inquired of the Heavenly Illuminated Master, I now fully grasp the intent of Heaven’s music. Before this inquiry, I thought making music was but a trivial matter—something any ordinary person could do at any time. Now, having asked, I shall never again dare to act recklessly."

"Excellent, discerning student! You may be said to comprehend the principles of the texts and have grasped the intent of Heaven. When Great Peace arrives, all baleful *qi* will depart."

"I humbly request to further clarify what still perplexes me."

"Go ahead, speak plainly without reservation."

"Indeed, indeed. Now, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth is half in ascendancy and half in repose—like day and night, without ceasing. Can music truly be made all day long? Or should it only be made in the direction of ascendancy, when the *qi* of prosperity prevails?"

"When first making music, it is because the Emperor-King begins—never does one begin with the *qi* of repose. The year is thus, the month is thus, the day is thus, the hour is thus."

"Though this student has yet to fully grasp the meaning, if one wishes to make music in a year, when the year resides in the east at *mao*, one makes music in the second month of spring. If one wishes to make music in a month, one aligns it with that month; for a day, with the day of ascendancy; for an hour, with the hour of ascendancy. In this way, one may be said to have attained the Dao of Heaven, and baleful *qi* will depart. If one does not act thus, it disrupts the heavenly order, and misfortune arises. Therefore, the sage-kings of antiquity, deeply understanding the intent of Heaven and Earth, dared not make music during inauspicious affairs. When inauspicious affairs encounter music, those inauspicious affairs daily increase and multiply, growing beyond remedy—thus, one must not make music then.

Heaven bestows nature, each with its own spirit. When one delights in goodness, the spirit of goodness arrives; when one delights in evil, the spirit of evil arrives. This is the natural disposition—nothing strange about it. Only the foolish fail to ponder this deeply."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

The Perfected One, wishing to know its great efficacy, may compare it to the Dao of Heaven. All that is pure and clear delights in returning to Heaven; all that is heavy and turbid delights in returning to Earth—each follows its own home, and none can be faulted for this. Thus, delighting in goodness brings goodness; delighting in misfortune brings misfortune, just as water flows downward and fire rises upward, not erring by even a fraction. The Perfected One entrusts this text to a ruler of virtue to show to ordinary people. Now that the *qi* of Great Peace has arrived, Heaven promotes goodness, causing all to delight in it, so there must no longer be those who, without reason, delight in misfortune. Those who delight in misfortune make enemies of Heaven and bring blame upon Earth—their transgressions cannot be erased. Today, those in Heaven call such people great rebels. Heaven’s baleful *qi* and all the faults within Earth will descend and converge upon them."

"May I ask: in urgent matters, when music must be made, and one performs auspicious music, but there is no time to wait for the hour of ascendancy—such as when battle is joined before the royal domain—what is to be done?"

"Excellent, your question grasps the essential point! In such cases, have the musicians remain in the royal domain, and if they cannot, have the musicians among the common people face the royal domain and petition it, using the same tones and the same measures. If only the person’s name and given name are known, and one holds to the pitch-pipes and calendrical reckoning so that the tones and *qi* correspond, one may also follow the *qi* of the hour of ascendancy and have that person perform the music—this too is permissible. In this way, all accords with the teachings of Heaven and Earth, preventing calamity. If one does not act thus, and the *qi* aligns with that of baleful prisoners, all manner of misfortune will arise. Moreover, when raising voices in song or leading music, one must also do so with the auspicious—auspicious tones and good deeds. The *qi* of the hour of ascendancy is like a ruler among men; it does not wish to hear of misfortune, baleful words, or inauspicious sounds. The reason is that the *qi* of the hour of ascendancy serves as the agent of August Heaven, presiding over life and bringing good deeds to fruition, thereby aiding Heaven in generating and completing all things. Evil sounds and baleful deeds do not aid Heaven in generating and completing all things. Thus, the *qi* of ascendancy does not wish to delight in hearing them, nor does the *qi* before battle. Therefore, the sage-kings of antiquity accumulated only good words and good deeds, never admitting baleful or evil matters. Such words were called ‘ominous speech,’ and the penalty was immediate execution. Even if the offense did not warrant death, they were killed simply for uttering ominous and inauspicious words. Perfected One, do you understand the severity of this prohibition?"

"Indeed, indeed. How excellent!"

"Excellent indeed!"

"You who understand early will long endure; those who do not understand become the root of death."

1. First, align with and delight in the *qi* of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons’ imperial *qi*. For every act, triple the joy to please Heaven, so that Heaven is greatly pleased. The emperor and kings enjoy long life, evil omens vanish, and celestial disasters are all dispelled. The *qi* of the sun does not rage in battle, and the realm remains at peace. Those who know to first move in accord with and delight in this *qi*—the Dao of Heaven prospers for them, true spirits emerge for them, and even those dwelling in hidden caves all gladly come to aid the right. How wondrous!

2. Second, first align with and delight in the *qi* of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons’ kingly *qi*. Double the joy to please Earth, so that Earth’s *qi* is greatly pleased and does not rage in battle. The ruler enjoys long life, treacherous thieves and weapons of war dissolve, and the realm flourishes in goodness. Below, all gladly submit to their superiors; the worthy emerge from the midst to aid in governing the state. Earth spirits comply in nurturing—how wondrous!

3. Third, first align with and delight in the *qi* of ascendancy and the subtle *qi*, so that the *qi* of harmony is greatly pleased. Ruler and ministers, the people—all act with reverence, each preserving their place. Thus, flattery, deceit, and theft do not arise, and the borders are secure. As harmonious *qi* daily grows, kingly *qi* is born, and all things incline toward goodness.

4. Take care never to move or delight in the *qi* of death and destruction, lest it invite violent thieves and many sudden deaths. The realm will be constantly imperiled, hard to pacify, and plagued by malevolent *qi* and spirits, causing grave harm. When this grows severe, it is called chaos and disturbance. The *qi* of extreme yin brings rebellion—beware, beware!

5. Do not move or delight in the *qi* of imprisonment and decline, lest it multiply thieves, prisoners, and legal cases, with punishments proliferating and peace difficult to achieve. The people will harm one another, resulting in many chronic illnesses.

6. Do not move or delight in the *qi* of decline and cessation, lest it produce many ailing and infirm people. It also breeds cunning and deceit, with people cheating one another, much slanderous speech, the realm lacking wealth, and the people mired in poverty.

Delight in the three upper divisions—the imperial, kingly, and subtle *qi*—and Heaven, Earth, and humanity will be pleased, bringing timely rains and dispelling disasters. This is called aligning with the good *qi* of Heaven, Earth, and humanity to bring forth good deeds. Delighting in the three lower divisions—the *qi* of death, destruction, imprisonment, decline, and cessation—invites calamities and rebellions. Heaven sends rain out of season, and malevolent harms abound, impossible to prevent. If these abandoned *qi* are stirred and delighted in, evil *qi* will burst forth in great measure. The wise and learned will hide, officials will fail in governance, the people and ministers will be hard to rule, and affairs will multiply in chaos. One cannot but guard against this—beware, beware!

All matters under Heaven and Earth have their fixed and constant laws. Where *qi* resides, one should face the honored and wish to see joy in places devoid of *qi*. Those in decline or near death should not be exposed to joy.

Thus, delighting in goodness is called "compliant governance" in Heaven; delighting in evil is called "rebellious decree." Compliant governance gains Heaven’s power; rebellious decrees incur Heaven’s enmity. Those who gain Heaven’s power attain longevity; those who incur Heaven’s enmity meet with misfortune. Why is this so? Heaven’s governance is like an echo—it does not wrest away what one cherishes. Delight in goodness and gain goodness; delight in evil and gain evil—what more need be said? Good and evil, safety and peril each follow their kind, never failing. Only fools do not consider this.

Thus, those who delight in the Dao gather the Dao; those who delight in virtue gather virtue; those who delight in martial arts gather martial prowess; those who delight in uprightness gather uprightness; those who delight in evil gather evil. Has it ever been otherwise?

Therefore, I have deeply pondered Heaven’s laws to warn you, Perfected One. How wondrous—Heaven’s laws must not be violated! Thus, I earnestly admonish you."

"Indeed, indeed."

The reason for tripling the joy in the imperial *qi* when delighting in the worthy is that imperial *qi* is most honored and supreme, symbolizing Heaven’s reverence—hence, it is tripled in joy. Heaven governs and controls Earth and humanity, so it is tripled to symbolize Heaven, Earth, and humanity. When Heaven, Earth, and humanity are seen to delight in and promote order, all things find their place, and auspicious signs and good omens—twelve thousand in number—all emerge in full. Thus, one first delights in them.

When delighting in them, one should listen attentively with single-minded focus, sit upright in prolonged contemplation, and feel joy in the heart, utterly content. Be loyal, sincere, and utterly without ill intent—like sitting before the emperor, not daring to act perversely. Heaven responds to such conduct: evil omens, disasters, and harms all depart without exception. Rely on Heaven as the honored, on imperial *qi* as the authority, and naturally follow Heaven’s laws—thus, achieving great peace is not difficult."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"As for doubling the *qi* of kingship in joyous music, the *qi* of kingship resembles Earth. Earth dwells alongside humanity, thus its joy is doubled—this is the joy of Earth. When Earth and humanity are seen to delight and rejoice, all things are properly ordered.

[Moreover,] tripling the *qi* of emperorship in joyous music is because the *qi* of emperorship is most honored and supreme, resembling Heaven’s supremacy, thus its joy is multiplied. The twelve thousand things all arise, and auspicious *qi* fully responds.

As for doubling the *qi* of ministers in joyous music, the *qi* of ministers resembles Earth, and Earth dwells alongside humanity, thus its joy is doubled—Earth and humanity dwell together. When all people are seen to delight and rejoice, all things are properly ordered. Yet Earth is lowly, so its joy is less than Heaven’s."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Furthermore, the *qi* of kingship is weaker than the *qi* of emperorship, lower by one rank, thus its joy is diminished. The principle of hierarchy follows naturally."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"As for the single performance of music for the *qi* of ministers and the subtle *qi*, the *qi* of ministers and subtle *qi* resemble the harmonious person. The harmonious person is lower than Heaven and Earth, thus their joy is less. Humanity governs the ordering of all things under Heaven and Earth; when people delight, they rejoice and do good, and when they do good, all things are ordered. If people do not delight, they do evil, and when they do evil, all things turn inauspicious."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Moreover, humanity is the chief of the harmonious ordering of all things. When the chief delights and orders rightly, all things are well-ordered; when the chief is disordered, all things fall into chaos. Thus, one first delights in the chief to follow the Dao of joyfully aligning Heaven, Earth, and humanity."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Therefore, the most honored and virtuous *qi* of supreme goodness is celebrated with tripled joy to delight in virtue. Thus, when the ancient emperors and kings governed well and aligned with Heaven’s will, they attained multiplied joy—this is clear proof. Now, as the *qi* of Great Peace arrives, we are taught to cultivate joy. When the *qi* of decline and chaos corresponds to inauspicious years, joy must not be cultivated; if one cultivates joy, it is called ‘joy in inauspicious decline,’ and Heaven names it ‘great rebellion’—the root of disasters and the source of calamities. How can one not be cautious?"

"Excellent! Excellent!"

Thus, the next level of joy is doubled, for the *qi* of kings does not match that of emperors, and so their joy is lesser. Therefore, when governance is only slightly virtuous, joy correspondingly diminishes. The reason for this diminution is that the *qi* is weak and not supremely good, so one dare not indulge in excessive joy. With inauspicious *qi* present, one dare not fully express joy—this is like a household with seven virtues and three vices, where the heart cannot rejoice wholeheartedly.

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"In a case of seven virtues and three vices, where good outweighs evil, can one rest content in joy? Though the human heart may rejoice, it constantly recalls the three vices, preventing pure joy—this is the nature of Heaven. Only when virtue is complete, with not a single worry, can there be great joy. Thus, joy is for delighting in virtue, not for delighting in misfortune."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"My words are the Heavenly luminous contract, not a single character is amiss. Therefore, the next level of joy is but a single expression, for the *qi* of ministers is faint and offers little stability. Human virtue is at its weakest, not matching the *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Thus, being faint and not equaling Heaven and Earth, their joy is diminished. The *qi* of ministers is subtle and sparse in its transformations. Within the central kingdom, evil often outweighs good, so one dare not fully express joy. To do so would be called ‘rejoicing in misfortune and evil.’ Since virtue is scarce, joy is scarce. The reason for this scarcity is that one only delights in the good within, not daring to rejoice in the misfortune and evil within. Rejoicing in misfortune and evil is like a petty person with seven vices and three virtues—only the three virtues allow for three moments of joy. With seven vices, there are sevenfold sorrows and afflictions. How can one find contentment in joy? The principle here is that ten is divided into three parts. The *qi* of emperors is entirely good in all ten parts; the *qi* of kings has two parts good and one part evil; the *qi* of ministers has two parts evil and one part good."

Thus, the *qi* of emperors mirrors Heaven, which constantly delights in life, harbors no harmful intent, and desires to bestow blessings. The Three Sovereigns emulated this, ever purely good and kind, without evil or harmful intent. Heaven is like the Three Sovereigns, and the Three Sovereigns are like Heaven. Therefore, the supremely good person has not a single vice, only ever desiring to do good. Does this not mirror Heaven? Does it not mirror the true spirit?

"Excellent! Excellent!"

The *qi* of kings mirrors Earth, which constantly nurtures and favors virtue. The Five Emperors emulated this. Though Earth’s nurturing is called ‘killing,’ the Five Emperors still employed punishments.

"Excellent! Excellent!"

The faint *qi* of ministers mirrors humanity, which has no constant principle and frequently changes. The Three Kings emulated this, having no fixed laws. Harmonious *qi* shifts and alters, sometimes advancing, sometimes retreating, so there is no constancy in high or low. When harmony encounters firmness, it follows; when it encounters softness, it also follows—thus, it has no constancy. The *qi* of decline, death, imprisonment, and ruin mirrors the myriad things, endlessly changing and disordered, with no regular pattern of emergence or withdrawal. The Five Hegemons emulated this, their *qi* chaotic and inauspicious, so they could not possess joy. The nature of Heaven and Earth is to delight in virtue, not to delight in evil. The martial power of Heaven and Earth is for punishing evil, not for punishing good. The laws of Heaven and Earth cannot be reversed.

[Appendix]
The joy of imperial *qi* is emulated by the Three Sovereigns, who are like Heaven. The joy of kingly *qi* is modeled by the Five Emperors, who mirror Earth, favoring virtue and nurturing all things, yet occasionally resorting to punishment. The faint *qi* is emulated by the Three Kings, who have no constant laws. The *qi* of decline, imprisonment, and ruin is emulated by the Five Hegemons, whose *qi* is chaotic. The martial power of Heaven and Earth is for punishing evil and upholding good—this must be deeply examined.

"Excellent! Excellent! I ask to inquire about the meaning of ‘joy for delighting in virtue.’ I wish to hear the great secret, so that even the dull-witted may fully understand and dare not ask further. May I hear it?"

"Do you yourself not yet understand?"

"I have gained some small understanding. Yet I fear that people of later ages, long sunk in ignorance and confusion, even if given these texts, may still not comprehend and may again violate Heaven’s prohibitions. Thus, I dare not refrain from asking for the great secret that is easy to know."

"Excellent are your words, for you have grasped their meaning. Very well."

"When seated in peace, one may then begin to understand.

Now, in years of supreme goodness and great joy, all the myriad things give rise to goodness, and every person rejoices, their hearts constantly filled with joy and longing to sing and dance. People silently love one another, without contention or strife, and joy arises of itself. Above and below, none harm or oppress each other, and all delight together. Thus, joy arises from goodness and delights in goodness—Heaven causes this to be so naturally."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"In years of great misfortune, not a single thing is good. Every person suffers from hunger and cold, wailing and weeping, harming and oppressing one another. Silently, sorrow, suffering, resentment, and anger arise, and their hearts know no joy. How could they sing, dance, or find delight? Silently, they wither and perish. Thus, in years of misfortune and calamity, there is no joy—Heaven causes this to be so naturally. This is clear evidence that Heaven does not delight in misfortune and evil.

Therefore, joy is born of delighting in goodness, while martial power arises from misfortune and calamity. Thus, when the ancient emperors and kings were about to rise, they received the response of joy and goodness; when they were about to decline, they received the response of evil. This is the natural law.

Thus, joy gives rise to goodness, and goodness gives rise to joy; misfortune and calamity give rise to martial power, and martial power gives rise to misfortune; non-action gives rise to joy, and joy gives rise to non-action; martial power gives rise to chaos, and chaos gives rise to martial power; joy gives rise to song and dance, and song and dance give rise to joy; misfortune and evil give rise to sorrow and suffering, and sorrow and suffering give rise to misfortune and evil.

Through this text, may people of later ages reflect upon and delight in it. Here, the explanation of the secret comes to a close."

"Excellent! Excellent!"

To the right: *"Arising"*—the five musical tones, when properly activated in sequence, align with the intentions of Heaven, Earth, and humanity to bring about Great Peace, eliminate disasters, suppress villainy, and usher in harmonious qi. Here ends the great secret. Untitled [Preserved]

*"Arising"*: The virtuous in my writings all possess azure heads and cinnabar eyes—why is this? My Dao is the true manifestation of cinnabar and azure. Azure embodies life and benevolence, possessing a heart; red is the great yang, the correct color of Heaven.

Here ends my Dao—the Dao of great yang and benevolent governance, which seeks no harm.

Untitled [Preserved]
**Question:** Now that the qi of the Supreme August Peace has fully arrived, what should be the order of governance between Heaven and Earth? May we hear of it?
**Answer:** Today, Heaven above establishes the model: for the joyful, follow with joy; for the suffering, follow with suffering. Such is Heaven’s model when the qi of Great Peace arrives. Thus, Heaven above follows joy to comply and serve it, urgently abolishing weapons and halting punishments. The same applies to Earth below. Joy is yang, the constant of Heaven; weapons, punishments, and warfare are yin, the wrath of Earth. When yin rises, it must harm yang’s transformation.

Now that the qi of Great Peace has arrived, Heaven and the divine soldiers govern together, thus severing punishments, weapons, and litigations, making all things clear and bright, never again to be recklessly disturbed. All shall be as the sun and moon, which cannot long remain hidden. When primordial qi naturally delights, it unites to generate Heaven and Earth; when pleased, yin and yang harmonize, and wind and rain are regulated. When wind and rain are regulated, they jointly generate the twelve thousand things. When all things delight, auspicious omens emerge together, and the responses of the myriad beings ascend as essence to Heaven, making the Three Luminaries ever more radiant. When the Three Luminaries delight and unite, the four seasons proceed in order: spring delights in birth, summer in growth, autumn in harvest, and winter in storage. When the four seasons rejoice, the Five Phases do not rebel, and the people flourish. When the people flourish, the emperor’s longevity is secured; when the emperor is long-lived, the common people rejoice; when the common people rejoice, spectral beings and malevolent spirits submit. When spectral malevolence submits, there are no premature deaths or illnesses; without harm to people, the qi of Great Peace arrives. The myriad states cease warfare, and thieves, bandits, and deceit vanish. The sixty thousand spirits of Heaven and Earth all rejoice, and the true immortals of Heaven and Earth emerge. When the true immortals of Heaven and Earth emerge, upright qi fully manifests while perverse qi wholly conceals itself. Evil people all sit in self-reflection, while the virtuous act; divine scriptures and strategies are revealed in full, and false, deceptive texts perish. None fail to rejoice and delight, as yin and yang harmonize and unite as one family, begetting one another. In all matters, joy brings no evil.

When yin and yang delight, it is the beginning of life, the origin from which the myriad things receive their mandate and arise—all resembling humanity. When men and women delight, they unite in heart and generate together, with nothing left unaccomplished. Without joy, they refuse to unite in harmony; if forced to unite in anger and displeasure, misfortune follows. My writings here merely outline the great principles, revealing the beginning of transforming the unvirtuous through joy—how could their full extent be recorded?

Having understood the goodness of joy, but not yet the prohibitions of its absence, I shall further expound its guiding principles: when dispirited and unwilling to join forces and unite in heart to co-generate primordial qi, they violate nature. When primordial qi is naturally displeased with contention, it cannot harmonize the body and unite in virtue to co-generate Heaven and Earth. When Heaven and Earth are displeased, yin and yang contend, unable to harmonize qi, regulate the four seasons and Five Phases, adjust wind and rain, or abundantly generate the twelve thousand things. When the twelve thousand things contend in displeasure, many are injured or die, and the year is greatly inauspicious. In all matters, contention without joy causes the Three Luminaries to lose their brightness, the emperor to grieve, and the people to flee. Virtuous qi is concealed, while malevolent qi prevails; upright spirits depart, and demonic beings arise. The myriad beings and people die prematurely, without longevity. When the twelve thousand states contend in displeasure, punishments surge, and warfare spreads; joy is severed and abandoned, and punishments escalate. When the six directions are disharmonious, each day brings misfortune. Heaven’s qi becomes disordered, beginning from this. Yet people, unaware of its cause, instead blame their superiors and hold the emperor accountable. Failing to recognize the great fault, they reverse the order, blaming above for what lies below, wholly inverting qi—how can Great Peace be achieved? Instead, misfortune ensues, punishments daily increase, and joy perishes. The blame lies with the teachings of the Middle Antiquity, where instructors repeatedly opened the gates of warfare and closed the doors of joy, allowing villainy to arise, impossible to swiftly suppress. The great fault lies here.

Thus, today the penetrating qi of Great Peace descends from above, greatly indulging joy and abolishing punishments. The same applies to Earth below—I cannot record it all. The goodness of indulging joy, the evil of indulging joy.

Therefore, the Dao of yin and yang extends from Heaven above to Earth below, spreading boundlessly. The male and female kinds frolic and delight in one another, then unite in heart to co-generate, co-accomplish, co-govern, transmit the legacy of Heaven and Earth, and wield the art of the infinite. If they do not frolic, refuse to unite in heart, and decline to co-generate, co-accomplish, co-govern, transmit the legacy of Heaven and Earth, or wield the art of the infinite, even if forced together through punishments and threats, they will eventually fail. Turning against one another in contention, yin and yang mutually harm and destroy, impossible to restrain. Even if father and son, mother and child, husband and wife—those most intimately bound—meet in harm, they jointly disrupt the Dao of Heaven, and no generation will endure. Such are the consequences of this great fault.

The music of joy is the warp of Heaven, the essence of the Great Yang. Filial piety is the warp of Earth, the essence of the Great Yin. Thus, joy initiates, gives life, and unites to accomplish success. Heaven ever delights in good and joyful generation, therefore it ever harmonizes with Heaven and shares its qi. Only when joy unites can mutual generation arise, and then there is above and below. Thus, joy belongs to Heaven and is above; filial piety, as Earth’s likeness, is below. Earth, being below, bears and obeys what is above; yin serves yang, children serve their fathers, ministers serve their lords. The lord above serves Heaven, and Earth likewise serves Heaven. Heaven serves what is above it, thus sharing qi with Earth. Therefore, joy and filial piety most accord with Heaven and Earth.

The *Yi* (Changes) governs the qi of yin and yang, with the eight winds as its measures, sharing position with the six jia, yin and yang as one body, joined in form with Heaven and Earth—thus it is the numinous Dao. Punishment, however, severs and hollows yin’s struggle, the qi of disharmony, and thus ever arises following yin’s measures. Punishment, when it meets yin, intensifies; when it meets spring and summer, it submits; when it meets autumn and winter, it flourishes. Thieves and bandits rise at night; wickedness and perversity act in dark and hidden places; ghosts, spirits, and all maladies erupt in darkness; resentments and grievances gather in perilous straits to slay one another. This is the great proof that joy does not follow punishment—can one not be cautious?

The foolish student fears this.
You who know fear—this is the sign of longevity. Those who do not know fear—this is the gate of misfortune. I warn you: be cautious.

Thus, in governing above, Heaven ever lets joy flow as the root of transformation. It causes all people to delight together in transformation, to sit and reflect on their faults and gains—how could doing good be difficult? Such is Heaven’s governance above, and so it is below on Earth. Therefore, those who wish to swiftly pacify governance must first cut off contention and punishment, and initiate joy—then the qi of imperial peace will immediately arrive.

May I ask: when the qi of Great Peace from above arrives in its time, all people will naturally transform into goodness, and the myriad things will naturally be at peace and free from illness. Now, Heaven above sets the model—why then does it rely on people to initiate it, creating joy to transform one another?

All matters lie in their beginning—one must guide and teach them. Good and evil are the forerunners of transformation, the opening of the gate for the ignorant and foolish. Thus, when Heaven is about to act, it always first initiates the beginning, and its sign appears in the heavens, divine patterns emerge. The sages of antiquity modeled their intentions upon these. Therefore, the Three Sovereigns above taught transformation through the Dao, and their people were all possessed of the Dao—so too were the myriad things. The Five Emperors taught transformation largely through virtue, and their people largely followed the warp of virtue—so too were the myriad things. The Three Kings taught transformation largely through culture, and their people were largely cultured—so too were the myriad things. The Five Hegemons taught transformation largely through martial power, and their people were largely martial, prone to anger, prizing strength and valor—this is not the beginning of complete transformation.

Thus, in the villages of good people, there are many good people; in the villages of evil people, there are many evil people—this is not interchangeable. All matters above in Heaven and below on Earth each have their own models and methods, each modeling their teachers’ methods, and what they transform all resembles one another. Heaven loves to give life and bring forth things, but if things are not joyful, they will not willingly live. Now, the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Great Cavern’s extremity has all emerged to govern, the essence of yang flourishes and rises, and the myriad things are all joyful and delighted. Therefore, one must model this qi and greatly let joy flow, to accord with and assist the Dao of Heaven—if one delights in this, then the Dao of Heaven is greatly pleased. Now, when emperors and kings govern with peace, the people are long-lived, so they let joy flow to serve the Dao of Heaven, and cause each to sit and reflect on self-transformation—what faults could there be?

Moreover, joy is Heaven, the essence of yang. When yang is present, the essence of yin submits—just as spring and summer arise, and autumn and winter submit, this is the natural pattern. The Perfected One must follow the words of my book, and punishment will naturally cease. To transform in this way is no different from the divine. Thus, if governance is difficult to pacify, it is because transformation has been lost.

Now, the Dao of Heaven naturally has decline and prosperity, good and ill fortune—why then do you speak of the beginning of transformation by teachers?

Heaven and Earth do not speak with people, so from time to time they give birth to sages, to sagely teachers, to transmit their affairs. When the times of Heaven are auspicious and joyful, good teachers are born to speak good words and enact good transformation. When the Dao of Heaven is about to fall into chaos, ill fortune, and decline, evil teachers are born to teach evil transformation. This is the sign that transformation governs the Dao of Heaven, and that it naturally brings forth good or evil.

Moreover, in years of joy, good things are born in abundance, the five grains mature to feed people, and those people delight in goodness. When the times of Heaven are evil, evil things are born in abundance, good things are few, and evil things feed people—those people’s countenances are evil. This is the clear sign of the teachers who transform people. Thus, when good teachers emerge, evil teachers submit—this is the sign of Heaven’s prosperity and decline, and that it governs Heaven.

Now, the Dao of Heaven has completed its great cycle, so it has sent me down to speak well of the Perfected One’s good affairs, to make joyful transformation the highest good, and thus to teach the first matter. When Heaven’s cycle is complete, its affairs are fully prepared, and all must be joyful. You who understand this principle—if all people and things are complete and present, there is joy in their homes. Now, Heaven’s cycle is complete—what is there not to delight in? How could one speak of ill fortune? This book will not change for ten thousand generations—such is the transformation of Heaven above!

"Heaven’s Joy Obtains Good People: Text Entrusted to the Fire Lord," Section 207

Now, the Perfected One has accumulated goodness and is worthy, understanding all matters. The qi of the Supreme Peace of the Great Cavern above has fully arrived—does the Perfected One also know what Heaven above urgently desires?

This humble student is foolish and dull, unable to comprehend—only the Heavenly Master knows.

Go, all Perfected Ones, sit at ease, and I will fully explain it to you. Now, Heaven above delights in obtaining good people, who can regulate wind and rain and bring forth all common things.

Since the initial opening of Heaven and Earth, those among humankind who practice goodness have been few—fewer still are those who align with Heaven’s intent. This has long been Heaven’s constant sorrow, for now there are none on earth who meet Heaven’s requirements.

Why does Heaven above not generate its own people, instead taking them from those on earth?
All things born of Heaven and Earth arise from the union of two as one. Now, the Heaven above and the Earth below form such a union. Every yang birth must occur within yin, and thus it is that Heaven takes people from this earth. Moreover, humans contain the intermingling of yin and yang qi, and must be born from the earth’s springs—hence they all take after the soil from which they arise. Therefore, the customs of the five directions differ, and the world’s minor variations never cease.

Thus, within each of the twelve thousand states, the people of one region do not resemble those of another. Do you understand this?
Indeed, indeed.

Those who are inherently good from birth are entrusted to their fathers, and good people are ultimately entrusted to Heaven. The finest essences of the myriad things ascend to form Heaven and become the Three Luminaries. Those of middling quality are entrusted to humans, enabling them to serve, follow the rhythms of yin and yang, and govern the myriad things. The lowest are entrusted to the earth, to walk upon it and perform their labors.

Do the Perfected Ones understand this?
Indeed, indeed. Excellent! Excellent!

Thus, when the heavens above now desire to harmonize wind and rain, nurture the myriad things, and delight in obtaining good people, I have been sent down to select and seek them. With this text I entrust the Perfected Ones, to be given to the conscientious people, that they may deliver it to the sovereign of the fire essence and the power of the Dao, and cause it to be shown to all under heaven, that they may together ponder my written words. Therefore, I entrust it to the Perfected Ones—take care not to sever its transmission. Should you fail in this, you will bring illness upon yourself; be ever vigilant in this matter.

Indeed, indeed.

Now, the foolish among the living suppose that the heavens above are boundless and upright, uniquely paired with this earth below?

Excellent is your question! Though the heavens move upward without bound, they too possess yin and yang, pairing as two. Is there also pairing below the earth?

Yes, the earth likewise moves downward without bound, and it too possesses yin and yang, pairing as two. Thus, one yin and one yang, above and below without end, extending laterally without limit. The Great Dao takes this as its nature; the heavenly law takes this as its constant. All use one yin and one yang as their throat and collar—this is the art of the Supreme Numinosity in its spontaneity. The governance of the boundless turns and returns to its beginning, without cessation or end.

I wish to distinguish one or two points for the Perfected Ones and expound the Dao. Will the Perfected Ones not understand?

Thus, I briefly raise its beginning for you, reveal its origin, and set forth its great principles. From these, you may reflect and bring forth its guiding threads, that the worthy and sagely of the world above and earth below may themselves find beauty in it. Do you understand?

Indeed, indeed. I wish to hear your instruction.

Very well. Carefully record my words in my teachings, and you may ascend and rest.

Indeed, indeed.

**Heaven’s Censure of Four Who Shame the Dao’s Admonitions, Scroll 208**

"What great abhorrence exists in the heavens above, called *Heaven’s Censure*? Perfected One, you have studied and practiced for so long—do you not deeply understand this as well?"

"Now, this foolish one falls short in so many ways. I wish to hear of it."

"Very well. From ancient times to the present, all who *arise* in the Dao take the August Heaven as their model. The most excellent appellation—crowning the unsurpassed, embracing the unbounded, inwardly without interior, emerging without gap, entering without aperture—serves as the teacher of all matters under heaven. It is the origin of life, the elder of all affairs, the enduring attainment of sages and worthies past and present. It is how emperors and kings win the heart of Heaven, becoming the parents who bring peace to the people, the source from which all transformations arise. Do you understand, Perfected One?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"The Dao is Heaven—pure and luminous, unwilling to be defiled or shamed. Yet now, those who study the Dao all engage in four ruinous deeds, jointly defiling the numinous Dao of August Heaven, throwing into chaos the principles of Earth, and thus can no longer serve as the head of transformation, as a model for teachers, or as parents. Together, they destroy Heaven’s precious vessel. Heaven names them all *great rebellious offspring*. *Cease!* You dwell upon the earth, yet do not conform to the model of teachers—how could Heaven, above, reverse itself and conform to your model? If you wish to know the truth of this: it is like a petty man living among the people, who does not conform to the model of teachers. When standing before the emperor, would he then conform to the model? If one remains below and does not conform to the model, yet Heaven above were to nurture him as a model—would this not be like Heaven and the emperor above treasuring and accumulating evil men? *Arise!* Thus, Heaven above deeply understands their deviation from the Dao’s intent and does not censure them out of mere hatred. Now, with the arrival of the Great Peace Qi of the Cavernous August Sovereign, it will no longer tolerate these four kinds of people. *Cease!* These four kinds of people cause both Heaven above and Earth below to despise those who practice the Dao, reversing their name to *evil offspring*. Therefore, the Dao of humanity daily declines and dissipates, decaying and never again rising. Now, the people of the world all engage in evil—this is precisely the ruin wrought by these four. Heaven above greatly abhors and censures them, and thus seeks to select anew. Do you understand, Perfected One?"

"This foolish one’s nature is dull and slow—I still do not comprehend. What does this mean? I wish to hear of it."

"If even you do not immediately understand, what can be hoped for from the common people? Very well. Open your ears and listen closely. I will explain in detail the great flaws and illnesses from which the Dao’s deviations arise, so that later learners under heaven may clearly know their loss of the Dao. *Arise!* The first is called *lack of filial piety*; the second, *not preserving one’s true nature*, leaving no posterity of their kind; the third, *eating feces and drinking urine*; the fourth, *acting as beggars*. Thus, these four kinds of people all jointly defile the true Dao of Heaven, utterly unfit to inspire transformation—*cease!*—and yet they have long served as models for teachers under Heaven above and Earth below. Even if they were to attain the Dao and ascend to Heaven, when Heaven examined them, they would be found entirely evil. Now, they cannot regulate wind and rain, bring forth the myriad creatures, or serve as teachers and elders."

"How lamentable! How lamentable!"

"Petty and ignorant, they remain utterly unaware of their offenses against Heaven. Now, only August Heaven and the enlightened masters—would that they might once more scrutinize with clarity, distinguish and resolve these matters, that I may humbly receive and further open my understanding."

"Proceed. Listen carefully, and I shall fully expound the meaning to the Perfected One, that it may serve as an eternal model for all generations. Let later learners, earnest and good, who practice the Dao, no longer violate Heaven’s prohibitions, so that when they attain the Dao and ascend to Heaven, Heaven above will rejoice in them. It is like an earthly king who, upon obtaining a virtuous person, governs together with them and likewise rejoices. Thus, what Heaven above promotes, the earth below mirrors—how excellent is this!"

"Indeed, indeed, your command is heard. The Daoist is Heaven’s teacher, the most precious treasure of Heaven. Those who practice it must conduct themselves as if Heaven itself had perfected them. The Daoist should ascend in conduct, for Heaven cherishes and employs such a one. Yet now, some who err and attain the Dao ascend to Heaven, only for Heaven to examine them and find instead conduct lacking in filial reverence. The Dao is the head of transformation, Heaven the model for humanity—how could it reverse its role to shelter and nurture the unfilial children of the world? If a child harbors such evil conduct, how could Heaven deem it fitting to grant this person long life and share governance with them? Would Heaven instead take such a rebellious one as its charge? Even on earth, such a person would not be employed—how then could Heaven employ them? Thus, not a single unfilial Daoist has ever ascended to Heaven. Though they depart, they are all deceived by wayward spirits and flattering demons, destined to dwell in death upon barren lands, in uninhabited wilds, where their forms are punished. Heaven’s response to humanity is like an echo to a sound—how could evil conduct yield good reward? Such a thing has been rare from ancient times to the present. Though many earthly kings have practiced the Dao, those who have transcended are few. Now, Heaven above has few virtuous people, none with whom to share governance, for their conduct is entirely wicked. Why then does Heaven not immediately slay them, but instead consigns them to barren lands, unpeopled wilds where the breath of life is cut off? The reason it does not immediately destroy them is that between Heaven and Earth, qi gathers in many places and is contained—thus it is called the harmonious mean. It is like human harmony, which encompasses all without exception. Thus, they are granted a brief respite. Heaven, which presides over clarity and brightness, is like one who stands before the sovereign—it cannot tolerate treacherous and evil people. Therefore, Heaven above does not govern together with such unworthy ones, and the earth below is the same. Heaven does not govern with the unfilial, just as a sage-king does not govern with the irreverent. Even a sage-king would not consent to govern with them—how then could Heaven alone do so? The sages of old, who refused to govern with them, deeply observed Heaven’s laws and modeled their conduct upon Heaven.

*Arise!* To govern with the foolish incurs Heaven’s great resentment. How is this known? When a ruler governs with them, Heaven manifests many disasters, strange omens, and frequent incursions by barbarians—this is clear proof of Heaven’s hatred. Is this not as precise as a compass and square, as binding as a contract? Now, if even humans, upon seeing others govern with them, detest and despise them, how could Heaven itself share governance with them? What humans hate, Heaven also hates. What humans cherish, Heaven also deeply cherishes. Thus, the sages of old, perceiving Heaven’s intent profoundly, always modeled their conduct upon Heaven, not daring to err even by a hair’s breadth. Therefore, they alone enjoyed Heaven’s favor and won its heart. Those who do not align with Heaven’s heart do not win its favor and meet with great misfortune. If human conduct is thus, how much more so for those who are to be Heaven’s chosen officers? Heaven’s chosen officers are to govern together with Heaven, administering the boundless arts, ever joining forces and harmonizing qi with a single heart. *Cease!* Perfected One, do you not understand? You must be vigilant—my words are the pure intent of Heaven’s heart and must not be violated. Those who violate them shall die. □□ indeed!"

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"Foolish beings grasp but a single good understanding in their hearts." "Even if you, sir, have attained this single good understanding, the common people do not comprehend—lost in darkness, they remain confused. Heaven detests this, and thus has sent me down to proclaim the great teaching and fully expound Heaven’s laws. From this point onward, learners must take heed and be vigilant!

Now, Heaven values the transmission of life through succession, so the four seasons receive Heaven’s Daoist instruction, passing life onward in an unending cycle to nurture all things. Thus, Heaven is called the Father of Generation, and Earth the Mother of Nurturance. Using the qi of the Six Jia, Twelve Branches, and Eight Trigrams as markers, they alternate in mutual generation and transformation, ensuring the Dao of Heaven endures without decay—this is the constant work of transformation and cultivation.

Those who study the Dao must model themselves purely upon Heaven’s laws. Yet many now act contrary to this, leaving no descendants and collectively severing Heaven’s lineage. Those who remain steadfast uphold Heaven’s nature, though their qi may be insufficient. The unfaithful, however, forcibly obstruct and block it, disrupting the Dao of yin and yang. When they sow their seed in the wilds, some abandon or kill their offspring, leaving their wives and children destitute—these are all people who greatly destroy and lose the Dao. They are utterly unworthy of emulation, being of the most inauspicious kind. How could they serve as teachers for humanity or stand as models for Heaven’s ordained masters?

Heaven, the Sovereign of All, is the elder of all affairs and the parent of humankind. All sages and worthies take it as their model—why then do some recklessly lose the Dao, becoming unfilial children without posterity, unfit to govern alongside it? If Heaven were to collaborate with such individuals, it would be called a master who shelters evil, promotes wicked arts, and abandons its sagely role as the teacher of humanity. Thus, it cannot but reject them.

The ancient sages and great worthies knew well to avoid such people, refusing to govern alongside those without descendants. To do so would be to lose Heaven’s favor. Therefore, Heaven causes the worthy and those with posterity to be honored, while despising those without heirs. The sages deeply understood Heaven’s intent and thus constantly modeled themselves upon it, never erring even by a hair’s breadth—how much more so for Heaven itself?

Now, for a long time, Heaven above has been devoid of good people, so it has sent me down to speak boldly and instruct those to come, that the foolish may all come to know. If Heaven were to employ such people, would it not become a gathering place for those without posterity? Acting in such a contrary manner, could one ascend to Heaven? Would Heaven then favor those without descendants and despise life?

Thus, they die in barren lands, lifeless soil, and uninhabited wilds, each returning to their own kind. You who do not cherish life oppose Heaven, so you are cast into lifeless places. You who favor desolation are sent to uninhabited wilds. The common people, blind and unseeing, claim they have transcended the world—yet in truth, they have not. I dare not deceive you, Perfected One. I have personally descended from Heaven’s realm, and whether you see or not is like showing the sun to the blind. If one tells them they are being deceived, they cover their mouths and laugh—such is the folly of the ignorant. Perfected One, be vigilant! What Heaven detests, those above detest as well."

"Excellent! Excellent indeed! This foolish student has never before witnessed such matters of Heaven—now truly, truly awakened at last."

"Strive diligently in virtuous conduct. My writings heal the ailments of Heaven and Earth, and relieve the sorrows and sufferings of emperors and kings. When your merits are complete, you will ascend to Heaven and witness these truths for yourself—then the great efficacy of my words shall be proven."

"Indeed, indeed. I dare not delay, nor dare I grow lax or negligent."

"Be vigilant and never grow lax or negligent. Should you truly falter in laxity or negligence, your great destiny shall be severed."

"This foolish student deeply reveres Heaven’s majesty and sincerely accepts and practices these teachings."

"Excellent! Excellent indeed! You have grasped Heaven’s intent.

Now, Heaven is pure and luminous; the Dao is clear and untainted. Heaven and the Dao dwell supreme above, serving as the model for humankind. Those who are pure and luminous favor purity and luminosity, thus the Three Luminaries ascend and adhere to Heaven, each following its kind, uniting as form and shadow. Heaven’s form is like a bright mirror, or like a person with two eyes that illuminate all—unwilling to behold defilement. Just as before a sage-king, one must always desire purity and luminosity—cease from beholding defilement, for to be defiled is to incur the transgression of annihilation and death. Perfected One, do you understand?"

"Indeed, indeed."

"Excellent indeed! Excellent indeed!"

"Thus, the human head and mouth resemble Heaven, unwilling to delight in beholding defilement, ever desiring freshness and clarity, desiring good things. Therefore, when the people of the world indulge in filth and defilement, offering such to others as food, Heaven sends down thunder and lightning to seize and take them away. Perfected One, do you understand that this is perverse and evil?"

"Indeed, indeed. I deeply fear it."

"From the Great Central High Antiquity to the present, people claim to be good, utterly distinct from common folk. Yet those who study the Dao often instruct one another to eat excrement and drink urine, calling themselves plain and good people—Heaven and the Dao deeply detest this. In Heaven, they are named the great rebellious offspring, and Heaven does not wish to see their human form. This is the work of great evil, the descent of dog and swine spirits.

Now, the Dao gives birth to Heaven, and Heaven possesses the Dao, which serves as the teacher and elder for all affairs. The upright Dao is that by which goodness is promoted and evil is eliminated. Thus, when ancient sage-kings and emperors were about to rise, they all received the Dao as their teacher, entering to receive its strategies and wisdom, transforming their people. The teacher was honored, and it was said that they could know the intent of Heaven’s heart, modeling their conduct after Heaven.

Heaven above also venerates and honors those of the good Dao, saying they can harmonize with the winds and qi, follow the four seasons, uphold the five phases, regulate wind and rain, assist the sun, moon, and stars in their luminosity, and cause the myriad things to flourish. How can those who eat excrement and drink urine serve as teachers? Even on earth, such teachers are unworthy of being called rebellious offspring—how could they ever become teachers in Heaven above? Such petty people are profoundly foolish, deeply mired in defilement that insults the Dao of Heaven. Perfected One, having received this ultimate text, ponder its meaning. What the earth below detests, Heaven above also detests; what Heaven above detests, the earth below likewise abhors."

Such earthly people who revile those who eat excrement and drink urine—Heaven above likewise reviles them, and thus dispatches thunder, lightning, and thunderbolts to descend and slay them. These words are merely meant to enlighten the people of the earth below. If Heaven’s revulsion is so severe that even those on earth abhor them, what use would Heaven have for them? Heaven is pure, luminous, and resplendent—how could it instead take them in as guests, gathering those who eat excrement and drink urine? Even if their transgressions were but momentary errors, and they attained the Dao in an instant, they would still be barred from ascending to Heaven. All shall perish in the five ruined lands of severed qi and ominous decay, thereby aligning with their conduct, manifesting their transgressions, and returning each to their rightful place—this is to ensure no deception remains.

Perfected One, when your years of virtuous completion draw near, take heed and be cautious, that you may instruct those who come after. When the Great Peace of the Supreme Sovereign descends with its harmonious qi, such vile conduct shall find no refuge—those who transgress shall surely die. How evident this is!

How solemn! How solemn!

Perfected One, do you understand? This is the awakening of the disciple. If you do not understand, you shall share in their guilt; if you know yet persist in such acts, your sins shall never be absolved.

“Yes, yes. I dare not, I dare not.”

Now, the nature of the Supreme Sovereign of Heaven is ever inclined to bestow and grant. Thus, it presides over giving, not receiving; over life, not death; over growth, not decay; over emergence, not containment; over triumph, not submission. To submit is to rebel, for the Dao of Heaven cannot be coerced or threatened—those who force or compel it shall perish.

Heaven presides over goodness, over clarity and brightness, and takes no delight in witnessing stagnation, defilement, or disgrace. Today, to be granted the Dao is to be granted the highest of honors. Thus, emperors and kings model their conduct upon Heaven, styling themselves as sovereigns without peer, daring not to deviate from Heaven’s Way. To act in accordance with it, even by the slightest measure, brings fortune; to stray from it invites great misfortune.

Now, those who study the Dao to attain longevity must wholly emulate Heaven. Heaven delights in life, so those who seek longevity must steadfastly guard the primal life-generating qi of Heaven, and their conduct must align with the intent of Heaven’s Dao. Earth, by contrast, presides over disgrace and destruction, over concealment—one must not follow Earth’s intent.

The Dao is the root of all transformation, the teacher and elder of all transformation. Thus, there is nothing under Heaven that does not arise by emulating it. Yet today, petty and foolish men who pursue the Dao bring no benefit to the people; instead, they collectively defile and disgrace the Dao of Heaven. Their rebellion is boundless, their formlessness extreme. In Heaven’s records, they are branded as rebellious sons, men of great misfortune—Heaven has no desire to behold them.

“What does this mean? My foolish mind is knotted and closed; I have not yet grasped it.”

"Excellent indeed is your question! Heaven has prompted your words—open wide your ears and eyes to listen.

Now, Heaven and the Dao do not favor deception, nor do they delight in killing or vainglory. Why then do you not divine with milfoil, prescribe remedies, and bring benefit to the people, allowing spirits to govern men so that illness may surely cease? These three kinds of men may all be called masters, yet they do not profit the Dao of Heaven, nor dare they defile and disgrace it.

The Dao of Heaven does not deceive; it ever demands utmost sincerity. If one deceives by means of the Dao of Heaven, in time, day by day, misfortune and decline will follow. The Dao of Heaven does not delight in defilement or disgrace, nor does it seek to benefit others. Heaven is supreme, and the Dao is yet more exalted. The Dao is the teacher and model of the Heavenly Thearch, loftier even than Heaven itself.

Thus, Heaven and the Dao preside over cultivation and rectitude, leading all affairs. They harmonize yin and yang, regulate wind and rain, order day and night, and array the ranks of all things. Between Heaven and Earth, none fail to receive grace and destiny, each attaining its proper place.

Yet today, the foolish who pursue the Dao instead engage in deceit, arrogance, folly, and madness. Together they confuse and disrupt the Dao of Heaven, ruining the foremost transformations of Heaven. They reverse course, begging and seeking alms from others, bringing no benefit to the people, defiling and disgracing the Dao of Heaven while inwardly profiting from the common folk. They cannot serve as models or teachers. Instead, they instruct later generations, each teaching the ‘Dao’ in ways that make people foolish, arrogant, deceitful, and mad, further engaging in defilement, disgrace, and begging. By such conduct, they are named the Dao of the foolish, mad beggars.

They cause all people to revile Heaven together, to despise the true Dao, and to sever the great transformations. Heaven deeply abhors them, and the Dao detests them; Heaven above does not wish to behold their forms.

Now, the Supreme Thearch of Heaven has sent forth the great rectifying qi in full measure. The sun, moon, and stars are arrayed in doubled radiance. The Dao and Heaven regulate wind and rain, harmonize yin and yang, and cause the myriad things to each attain their proper place. Those who formerly encountered the Dao and ascended to Heaven—none among them were fit for office. Heaven above questioned them and found all to be at fault; they could not be employed together. Yet you, dwelling upon the earth, are still called foolish, mad beggars.

How can those unfit to be teachers of emperors and kings be fit to be teachers of Heaven above? Heaven abhors them, and the great Dao declines and decays. The fault lies with the people of later ages who, in learning from one another, have lost the proper standards.

Heaven is afflicted by this, deeply grieved. The Dao of Heaven is obstructed, and so it has sent me down to speak with the Perfected Ones, to distinguish the gains and losses of the Dao. May the people of the world awaken as one, all understanding the intent of Heaven above. Let them reform their conduct, transform their hearts, and no longer violate Heaven’s prohibitions—then those who study will succeed.

If they persist in their former ways, Heaven will not raise them up. They will surely return to die in the land of the five disgraceful punishments, their lives consigned to the five defiled soils, cut off in the wilds of folly and madness where no one dwells—above, the three luminaries are absent; below, there is no good earth."

"Why is this so? I wish to hear it—how grave is their transgression?"

"“It does not condemn them outright. The Dao of Heaven is the law, and each follows its kind—this is the lower realm seizing them.”

“If so, why does it not kill them immediately, but instead brings them to this point?”

“If it wished to annihilate them at once, yet those people themselves claim they desire long life and hold fast to belief; if it were to kill them halfway, they would again wail to Heaven and weep upon the earth, calling themselves deeply wronged, unaware of how their transgressions arose. Thus, Heaven examines them and sends them forth, later casting them into the land of the five disgraceful punishments and mad folly, so they may come to know themselves.

If you wish to know the truth of this, it is like a wise king investigating a person’s faults and holding them accountable—not immediately putting them to death. Rather, according to the severity of their crime, they are sent to prison: great crimes to great prisons, lesser crimes to lesser prisons, where they are dealt with until the person submits, comes to know their guilt, and dies without resentment or complaint. If their words are not thoroughly examined, they will surely protest their innocence, die harboring grievance, and depart with hatred. Thus, the lords of the Five Hegemons—many of their subjects and ministers died with resentment in their hearts.

Do you now understand that the administration of punishment in Heaven is like this? Perfected One, do you comprehend?”

“How profound! How profound!”"

“Ah! Do you understand that alarm is the gateway to life, while unawareness of alarm is the root of death? Guard well my words—my words are the true weapons of Heaven, not to be defied or slighted. To defy them brings harm: slight defiance, slight harm; great defiance, annihilation. I caution you, Perfected One, with a single word: people of later ages accumulate folly, trusting their ignorant hearts, and say, ‘This cannot be,’ only to bring ruin upon themselves. I have personally traversed the ways of Heaven above and know their [unfailing] workings below—ten thousand times without a single error. I dare not deceive you; to deceive you would be to disrespect not the Perfected One, but the majesty of Heaven. Thus, my words are trustworthy and doubly so. The reason I speak repeatedly is to guard against those who might stubbornly err. Therefore, I reiterate, that my words may be rich in pattern and [clarity].

The affairs of Heaven are truly distant and difficult to know, so their patterns are frequently revealed below, aligning with earthly matters. When goodness arises on earth, goodness arises in Heaven. When evil arises on earth, evil arises in Heaven. Thus, when people do good on earth, Heaven responds in kind; when people do evil on earth, Heaven responds with evil—such is the ascent of qi. The five qi are interconnected, above and below as one; the six jia are linked, above and below as one; the twelve branches unite above and below, with no distance too far for their resonance. When below is good, above is bright; when below is evil, above is ominous. Thus, the five phases flourish below, and the five stars shine above. This is how Heaven enlightens the people of the world.

All three luminaries follow this principle. Heaven above and earth below share the same three luminaries: when the three luminaries shine below, so too in Heaven; when Heaven shines above, so too on earth. The two correspond in harmony, forming the warp of the Way. What is greatly good in Heaven is also greatly good on earth. Just as Heaven has the six jia and twelve branches, so too does earth; just as earth has the six jia and twelve branches, so too does Heaven. Thus, above and below constantly correspond, not deviating by even a fraction. Perfected One, be vigilant.

Though my words are profound, do not conceal them; share them with learners, but only after fasting and purification. Guard them well. Follow the text as law, and do not recite it carelessly.”

“Understood, understood.”

“Permit me to inquire: since the Highest Antiquity of the Middle Era, among those who have taught the Way under various guises, many have abandoned home and forsaken kin, cast off wives and children; many have feigned beggary, feigned madness and deception, eaten filth and drunk urine. Later learners, following their example, have all had masters and methods—yet none have acted without purpose.”

“Excellent! Your question cuts to the heart of their perverse intent. Does Heaven despise them, that you ask this? How cunningly phrased—why do you raise this?”

“I have long been troubled by it, yet lacked the opportunity to ask directly; my heart has ever been heavy with doubt.”

“Excellent! Has Heaven indeed appointed you to raise this matter? Very well. Open both ears, and I shall distinguish the truth for you.

When the Supreme Heaven first revealed the true Dao, it was not like this. All practiced filial devotion to parents, maintained posterity with wives and children, preserved proper form and bearing, neither feigned madness nor ate filth nor drank urine. All conducted themselves in accord with the Dao, their actions conforming to its laws. The highest adepts became teachers and counselors to emperors and kings, transmitting their kind and nurturing one another, without harm. In that age—like the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—they acted by the true Dao, striving to benefit and never to harm. Thus they practiced the true Dao openly, without concealment.

When the Three Kings brought chaos and the Five Hegemons arose, rulers and ministers and common folk deceived and slighted one another. Hence the false feigning of madness, the fear of being recognized, the beggary, the eating of filth and drinking of urine—these were the conduct and speech of the destitute, the desperate. The Dao, too, has its cycles of decline and flourishing, like the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons.

In the Latter Era, the way of hegemony prevails: beggary, abandonment of kin, casting off of wives and children, eating filth and drinking urine—these mark the decline of the Dao and the rise of hegemony. Thus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors often attained the Dao and ascended to Heaven, some through corpse liberation, others by bodily departure. The Three Kings died at the end of their allotted years, while none of the Five Hegemons obtained the true Dao; all perished in battle upon the wilds. Now, in the Latter Era, those who cling to this hegemonic way shall likewise perish upon the wilds—this is what is meant.

I do not deceive you, Perfected One: this, too, is a hegemonic path, no different from that of the hegemonic kings. How could one ascend to Heaven by such means?”

“Excellent! Excellent! The confusion in this foolish student’s heart is now truly dispelled. I never imagined the Dao could have a hegemonic aspect. Only through the Celestial Master’s explanation have I come to understand.”

“Truly, truly...! You may be said to have awakened.”

“May I ask: what should learners of today do?”

“Now, the great cycle of the Heavenly Dao is complete and fully arrayed. From this time onward, it differs from the past. If one seeks to practice the hegemonic methods of the Middle Era, the true Dao will not come. Perfected One, be vigilant and cautious!

If you desire long-lasting joy and preservation, cultivate my texts. Lose but a fraction of a *zhū*, and your life will not be whole—how can you fail to guard it?

The primordial Dao has arisen in its august aspect; the fire-light proceeds, and the hegemonic way is severed. Though Heaven is vast, it has its own principles of division, manifesting texts to all people that they may deliberate together. What belongs to the high should be assigned to the high, what to the middle to the middle, what to the low to the low; what should be shared by high, middle, and low should be so shared. Why do you not perceive its sincerity and trustworthiness...? It is like speaking with Heaven itself.”

“Excellent! Excellent! The qi of the times is now balanced.”

“How does the Perfected One know this?”
“I saw Heaven personally dispatch the Heavenly Master to descend and speak, and thus knew the qi of Heaven is balanced.”
“Excellent! Excellent! You have grasped its meaning.”
“I humbly request to ask one or two more questions, daring not to speak excessively.”
“Proceed with the Way.”
“From this time onward, where should all who seek the Dao turn?”
“All should seek it in secluded chambers, without abandoning parents or departing from wives and children. Proceed gradually, and only cease when seclusion is complete. If one’s inner nature is not virtuous yet seclusion is forced, no benefit will come—rather, one may die prematurely. Each must examine their own truth and act without betraying Heaven. People may be deceived, but Heaven cannot be deceived; do not fear others acting wrongly. Let each govern themselves by this principle. Those who dare not practice the Dao are wicked people, those who wish to deceive and feign. Judging by this, not one in ten thousand will err. If learners are thus, deceit and cunning will vanish, and the good and evil among people will be plainly seen. This is called *The August Heaven’s Selection of the Worthy*, a text by which the highest may attain transcendence of the world, the middle may serve as counsel to emperors and kings, and the lowest, though ignorant and obstinate, may become prudent folk among the people. Perfected One, take heed of this.”
“Indeed, indeed.”

“May I inquire how one with deficiencies and leaks may attain the Dao and depart?”

“Simply put, when the Dao is accomplished, one departs—nothing more. If the Dao is not yet accomplished, one should daily serve their parents, protect their wife and children, and proceed gradually with purity and stillness. Day by day, one will come to understand their own intent. The worthy together uphold this teaching.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

*[Right] Celestial Writ for the Selection of the Worthy: On the Interruption of the Dao and the Abandonment of Hegemony to Preserve Life, Easing the Heart and Dissolving Cunning, Serving Parents and Protecting Wife and Children*

**Volume 118 of the *Tai Ping Jing*, Geng Section, Part 16**
**Scroll 118 of the *Tai Ping Jing***
**Scripture 290: The Prohibition Against Burning Mountain Forests**

“May I ask the Supreme Celestial Master of the Highest Cavern: though this humble and unworthy student does not dare hope for it, the Master has graciously taken pity on my foolishness and deigned to speak of celestial matters. Having already granted this, you have opened the path for me to know the affairs of Heaven. I wish to inquire: what does the Heaven above delight in, and what does it forbid? I seek only its prohibitions, that I may day and night ponder their meaning, never dare transgress them, and pass them on to later generations.”

“Excellent is your question, for it grasps the essential meaning. Perfected One, be seated, and I shall expound it for you—a teaching that may be transmitted for ten thousand generations, never to fade.”

“Indeed, indeed. I receive your command with profound gratitude.”

“No need for thanks. You inquire on behalf of Heaven and Earth, and I, as the agent of Heaven, speak—not for your sake alone, but for the common good. Why should you thank me?”

“If I do not thank you, it would seem I take the Dao lightly and make light of your labor. Yet if I thank you, it may touch upon taboos and seem immodest.”

“It is only that I fear the text will grow too lengthy and the words too numerous, making it difficult to comprehend. Thus, I limit my speech to the Perfected One. Words are the handle of the Dao, the origin of all scripture—do not be disheartened, for I shall now distinguish these matters for you.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Now, in the Heaven above, the Primordial Qi of the Supreme Sovereign arrives in full flourishing. The yang sun shines brightly, perverse qi ceases and rests, upright qi prevails, and decay dissipates—this is the yang of virtue and the Dao.

“Why does Heaven above strictly forbid the burning of mountain forests and thickets? I wish to hear the reason.”

“Mountains are the great yang, the warp of the land, its ruler. Trees, spreading their roots, are its elders—also its rulers, its yang. Fire, too, is the ruler and elder of the Five Phases, its yang. Three rulers, three yangs, when they meet, instead weaken one another. Thus, Heaven urgently prohibits the burning of mountain forests and thickets. If trees are not burned, they remain within yin. Yin is called ‘mother,’ and thus leans downward.”

“Why does Heaven cause the branches of *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* to first sprout and flourish abundantly, so that fire reigns and the sun grows brighter? Why do *bing* and *ding* flourish, and *si* and *wu* rejoice? I wish to hear the reason.”

“This is the celestial pattern, its nature. When the mother is abundant and reigns, her children prosper. When the children prosper, they receive qi for a long duration and attain longevity. Thus, Heaven prohibits this. When yang flourishes, the perverse yin dissipates daily; when yang wanes, the perverse yin arises daily. Therefore, cunning and deceit always arise in the dark of night—this is the great proof that when yang wanes, perversity arises. Thus, Heaven desires to eliminate perversity and forbids this. Such is the natural method and law. What holds true in the Heaven above also holds true on Earth below.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“May I ask why the convergence of the three yangs leads to misfortune and decline?”

“Excellent is your question—you have grasped its essence. Now, the three yangs correspond to the yang of Heaven, the yang of Earth, and the yang of Man. All three are entirely yang, without a trace of yin; all three are entirely rulers, without a single subject; all three are entirely male, without a single female. This is the path to annihilation, the Way without posterity. It dares not transmit its kind, nor can it mutually generate and complete. Thus, it is inauspicious. This is what is meant by having Heaven but no Earth, having the sun but no moon, having the above but no below, having the exterior but no interior. In Heaven above, this is called the ‘Cycle of Imminent Ruin,’ and thus it is detested and forbidden.”

“Excellent! Foolish as I am to have asked this, I am deeply alarmed.”

“To know alarm is the root of life; not to know alarm is the gate of misfortune.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

**Method for Burning the Grass of the Lower Fields (Section 210)**

“May I ask whether the grass of the lower fields may be burned?”

“Heaven above does not forbid burning. It should be burned.”

“Why, then, should it be burned? I wish to hear the reason.”

“Now, grass is the yin of wood and corresponds to *yi*. Wood corresponds to *jia*. *Jia* is yang and of the same kind as wood, thus they correspond. *Yi* is yin and of the same kind as grass, thus it corresponds to *yi*. *Yi* fears metal, and metal injures wood. When wood is injured, yang declines; when yang declines, perverse and cunning things arise. Thus, it should be burned.

Furthermore, Heaven above says: *Yi* is yin, grass is yin, and the lower fields are the yin of earth. When the three yins converge, they jointly give rise to perversity. Thus, the Dark Warrior dwells in the northern pole of yin, and at the extreme of yin, yang is reborn. Fire is yang, and when yin obtains yang, it follows auspiciously, generating good affairs. Therefore, Heaven above teaches to burn the grass of the lower fields to please yin and invigorate yang. Thus, it is burned. What holds true in Heaven above also holds true on Earth below.

*Jia* is the wood of Heaven above. *Yi* is the grass of Heaven above. What of *yin* and *mao*? Now, *yin* is also yang—the wood of Earth below. *Mao* is yin—the grass of Earth below. These four all move eastward. Yet yang is called wood, and yin is called grass. This is the natural law, the classic of Heaven above. I dare not deceive you, Perfected One.

You inquire of Heaven to resolve doubts, and I expound the affairs of Heaven. Together, we share the duty, jointly ordering yin and yang, eliminating the maladies of Heaven and Earth, ensuring the Emperor and kings suffer no hardship, and enabling the twelve thousand things to each attain their place. None will fail to emerge in joy, and there will be no grievances or entanglements.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Now, Perfected One, you may be said to have grasped the Dao.”

“You are too kind, too kind.”

“Now, in learning and inquiring of the Dao, what offering do you make in gratitude?”

“As you command.”

“Bind it to your heart and mind, never to depart.”

“Excellent! Excellent! Your learning and inquiry have attained their proper measure.”

**Heavenly Spirits Examine and Record: The Threefold Concordance Formula, Scroll Two Hundred Eleven**

“Now, the harmonious and balanced qi of Heaven above has arrived, yet I constantly fear that the people may inadvertently violate the seasonal ordinances and harm it. Today, all the spirits of Heaven record those who delight in killing and wounding, the sons who hunt, shoot, fish, and trap, those who defy the Dao of Heaven and do no good, who constantly take pleasure in killing and wounding. Heaven deeply reproves them, Earth deeply abhors them, and the host of spirits deeply condemns them. Now, I fear that petty men, accumulating folly, can no longer be restrained, jointly polluting and disrupting the pure and balanced qi of the Cavernous Sovereign. Thus, today’s great urgency: the spirits are dispatched to record them, following their conduct day by day, even in small matters, to examine and assess them. Three years, including intercalary months, form one intermediate reckoning; five years, one great reckoning. Those with grave transgressions are punished accordingly; those with minor faults have their years diminished and their allotted lifespan reduced. Every three generations, a great rectification occurs; every five generations, a great eradication. Therefore, today Heaven gathers the three Dao to issue documents, and the host of spirits jointly records transgressions, cutting off the practice of killing, wounding, and penal punishment, while fostering joy. The same holds true on Earth.

Perfected One, fortunately incline toward goodness, ever desiring to hold virtue before August Heaven, and pitying the Emperor and kings in their sorrow and hardship when the seasonal qi is disharmonious. The fault truly lies with those who delight in killing and wounding, hunting, shooting, fishing, and trapping, jointly enacting penal punishments, constantly harboring hearts that oppose Heaven and Earth. Thus, long-standing disorder and disharmony persist, and Emperors and kings, past and present, suffer sorrow and hardship—this is a grave transgression.

Perfected One, if you would ever render merit to Heaven and bestow favor upon the Emperor and kings, today Heaven accumulates its grievous malice. The host of spirits instructed me in these words, and thus I now transmit this document to you, Perfected One, to return it to a virtuous ruler and display it to all under Heaven. Let each person, upon receiving this document, deeply reflect, ponder their faults, and heed the words of Heaven. Now, the harmonious and balanced qi has arrived in full, and it does not favor those who act with malice and harm. Knowing that Heaven above holds these words, how dare I not transmit them below? To remain silent would be to act with malice and harm, bringing calamity upon myself. I dare not transgress, and thus I report these matters. All Perfected Ones, be vigilant. If a Perfected One does not speak, harm will befall you; if you display it to the common people and the foolish still wish to transgress, harm will befall them, and Heaven will no longer hold the Perfected One accountable.

From this day forward, Heaven will activate the host of spirits to conduct examinations and govern the people. In Heaven above, the three Dao gather to issue documents recording transgressions; the spirits likewise issue documents in three Dao to record transgressions; thus, people also issue documents in three Dao to record transgressions. Therefore, people take their pattern from Heaven, and Heaven takes its pattern from people. Heaven, Earth, and humanity each have their affairs, modeling themselves on the numinous spirits and likewise patterning their affairs after their laws. Thus, ghosts and spirits, with their essence and qi, admonish humanity, and admonition constantly arises simultaneously in Heaven, Earth, and humanity.

Therefore, spirits respond to Heaven’s qi and act; refined beings respond to Earth’s qi and arise; ghosts respond to human governance and contend. These three are the agents of harmony and disharmony in Heaven and Earth, moving in accordance with the spirit-qi, responding to the seasons as they come and go, traversing the Cavernous without interruption, their comings and goings difficult to discern. Thus, today’s Dao of transmission and governance differs from that of ancient times. Using the present to prognosticate the past often misses the mark, and using the past to prognosticate the present no longer corresponds. Thus, ancient texts have declined and are difficult to employ; using them does not yield accurate results. Yet there are places where true and authentic documents are gathered.

Therefore, Heaven above speaks of examining and recording the threefold concordance of past and present, selecting the best from the middle to clarify affairs and align intentions. Only then will the Dao of Heaven be upright, the kingly Dao complete, all evil and wickedness dispelled, the Emperor and kings filled with great joy, and affairs at peace. People, acting with caution, will naturally accord with Heaven’s intent.

Perfected One, do you grasp the gravity of these matters?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Excellent! You have comprehended their meaning.”

The right [section] speaks of Heaven’s prohibition of fire to foster life, severing punishments that wound and kill, and halting hunting and archery that violate the seasonal qi—all recorded here as acts Heaven abhors. *True Texts of the Great Peace: Collated and Aligned*, Scroll 119, Geng Section 17. *Scroll One Hundred Nineteen of the True Texts of the Great Peace*. "The Three as One Household: Yang Fire’s Number Five Formula," Two Hundred Twelfth.

“A humble one of lowly birth ventures to ask: Now that the Dao of Heaven is complete, nothing is absent, and nothing is not encompassed.
What does Heaven observe, that it suddenly desires all life to flourish while urgently enforcing punishments?”

“Excellent is your challenging question—it grasps the meaning.
I have always deeply cherished your words.
Your words constantly rouse my intent, causing my Dao to flourish.
If even you cannot pose such a challenging question, who else could?
Thus, the Dao of Heaven has long been severed, obstructed, and uncommunicated, and Heaven suffers grievously from this.
I have long been despondent, wishing to speak but having no one to address, so the Dao of Heaven has lost its proper order for ages.
Year after year, up to the present, Heaven has sent forth sages to speak, yet none have fully resolved its afflictions.
Therefore, it has now caused a Perfected One to come and meet me, so that at last I may fully discourse on Heaven’s behalf.
Your challenges alone deeply accord with Heaven’s intent. Sit at ease, and I shall exhaustively expound the Dao for you.
I wish not to speak, but I fear Heaven’s majesty.
Thus, whenever you ask, I am compelled to speak—nothing may be concealed.
Does the Perfected One also understand this?”

“Indeed, indeed.”

Indeed, you have understood well.

Now, the reason Heaven above desires all things to be fully born and grow, yet urgently harms and injures them, is that the Dao of Heaven invariably regulates the three qi. The first favors generation and is called yang; the second favors completion and is called harmony; the third favors destruction and is called yin. Thus, Heaven presides over generation, while humankind presides over nurturing and completion—completion is called destruction, and destruction is called concealment. Heaven, Earth, and humankind share this common work, their affairs mutually dependent. Without yang, nothing is born; without harmony, nothing is completed; without yin, nothing is destroyed. These three are interdependent as one household, together bringing forth the twelve thousand things.

Yet the Dao of Heaven is rooted in the mean. Now, since the Dao of Heaven first arose, it has completed a great cycle and returned, coming to belong to humankind and to yang. Yang favors generation and abhors destruction; what is generated requires joy, and only then can hearts unite to mutually engender. But if destructive qi intervenes and injures, they cannot generate or complete. If you wish to know its truth, consider the child in the womb: even a slight harm will cause injury and death, and once dead, it cannot be revived. One is cast aside, and this leads to unceasing injury, resulting in extinction without posterity—one household is cut off and lost. Thus, the urgency of harsh punishments and destructive harm is especially great.

The Dao of Heaven is not always like this. Now, the urgency is even greater, so I shall make it clear and distinct for the Perfected One to discern, that people of later ages may fully awaken to the Dao of Heaven. Now, I do not wish for destructive harm to sever the intent, which is why I speak so clearly for the Perfected One. Common people follow me, but they merely engage in empty literary embellishments and crafty speech. Therefore, I shall further expound the evidence of Heaven’s judgment.

Now, at the *jiazi* inception, Heaven is aligned—on the day of the winter solstice, it begins to return to its origin. At *yichou*, Earth is aligned—things spread their roots. At *bingyin*, humankind is aligned—at dawn, people rise, open their doors, and attend to their duties. These three together are the beginnings of Heaven, Earth, and humankind, the root of all things. The inception of generation belongs to yang, and yang is the primordial qi of Heaven, Earth, and humankind. Thus, *qian*, *kan*, *gen*, and *zhen* reside in the northeast, with harmony at their center, between *kan* and *gen*, where yin and yang unite to generate at the center.

Thus, all who conceive dwell in the middle of the abdomen, slightly below the center of harmony, between head and feet. When yang unites, it generates first, issuing forth its form and qi, casting them to other regions. This is where the three qi of Heaven, Earth, and humankind first arise, where things begin anew. Above and below, there must be no destructive or harmful qi residing within. Only when virtue and yang qi are established can the myriad things attain their full generation; if inauspicious qi intervenes, they are injured. Thus, destructive influences must be expelled.

Now, the Dao of Heaven has completed a great cycle and begun anew, with pure yang governing Heaven and Earth above and below. Therefore, punishments must be urgently abolished. Heaven is called spirit, and yang is also called spirit. Thus, Heaven now sends spirits to govern humankind. Does the Perfected One wish to know whether my writings align with Heaven? From now on, those who violate my writings and favor harsh punishments and destruction will be examined by Heaven above. People will also urgently condemn them, and spirits will examine them. Though Heaven above and Earth below are in different realms, they conspire as one; though ghosts and spirits do not share a household with humankind, they too conspire together. This is the advent of Heaven’s balanced qi.

The inception of Heaven’s qi begins anew above, the inception of Earth’s qi begins anew below, and the inception of humankind’s qi begins anew at the center. These three qi now arise together, and they do not wish to encounter destructive or inauspicious qi—they all desire to encounter joyful qi. Thus, from now on, Heaven and Earth will joyfully abolish punishments. Does the Perfected One understand?

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Foolish and benighted as I am, I had thought that Heaven above swiftly punishes those who do evil and prohibits injury through punishments and killing. I never imagined that this concerns the primal qi of Heaven, Earth, and humankind in their gestational embrace, the very origin of renewal. Hearing the Celestial Master expound this, I am deeply awestruck and ●.”

“That you are awestruck and ● shows you have awakened and grasped the intent of the Dao of Heaven. Excellent! Take heed of this text and its warnings, and be careful never to sever it, lest you harm yourself.”

“Indeed, indeed. I dare not, I dare not.”

“Go forth and hold it in high regard. In all learning and inquiry, each person acts for their own sake, striving to align with the Dao of Heaven.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“Do not conceal these Heavenly prohibitions and taboos.”

“Indeed, indeed.”

“May I ask why the Dao of Heaven now designates this time as the great cycle, the primordial beginning, and why it meticulously examines and rectifies the texts?”

“Excellent is your challenging question—it aligns perfectly with the heart of Heaven. Now is the ascendant phase of the Five Yangs, the inception of the Five Fires. The supreme Fire ascends to become Heaven, embodying the radiance of the sun and moon. Fire is red, as is Heaven; Heaven’s hue is red, and so is Fire’s. Red is the color that befits the numinous. Heaven and the numinous endure perpetually, attaining the origin of all things. Thus, the eleventh month marks Heaven’s reckoning, and so it is above as well. Its qi is red, and red signifies the sun’s return. Its initial nine qi belong to *jiazi*, the foremost of the Six *Jia*s. *Jia* embodies essence, the heart of all matters, and thus *jia* emerges first from *zi*, ascending to become the Heart Star. Therefore, the spirit of Fire resides in the human heart. The human heart, as the seat of the numinous and sagely, is the most revered and truly good. Thus, the sagely heart of the numinous can create and initiate all things, serving as their primordial origin. 〈Thus〉 the law of the numinous and sagely begins with the heart, and nothing remains unexplained. The most flourishing of the red is Heaven, the sun, and the heart. Heaven, the sun, and the heart are ever luminous, illuminating all without exception. Henceforth, those who practice this Dao will utterly eradicate all that is wicked and perverse. The generation of Yang occurs within the depths of darkness. Thus, Yang qi arises in the north, emerges in the east, flourishes in the south, and wanes in the west—such is the law of Heaven 〈concluded〉.”

“Excellent! I wish to know why the birth of Yang now occurs precisely within the depths of darkness.”

“All that is born returns to its origin; only when Yin and Yang unite can life arise. Thus, all that is born reverts to its initial beginning. When Heaven and Earth were undivided at their inception, there was neither above nor below, neither sun nor moon nor the Three Luminaries. All was profoundly dark, without distinction or principle. Though without division or principle, within it inherently existed above and below, left and right, exterior and interior, Yin and Yang, all held in mutual balance yet undifferentiated. When Yin and Yang first coalesced to give birth, their emanation was undivided, without distinction. Only after birth did head and limbs take form. How do we know the initial generation of Yin and Yang was thus? Therefore, when humans undergo transformation to give life, they all withdraw into secluded, dark places—Heaven ensures they do not forget their origin. The initial reception of Heaven and Earth’s law is their primal state, and thus Heaven ensures they do not forget.”

“Excellent, excellent! Hearing the August Celestial Master’s words, I now understand the principle of division.”

“You may be said to have been easily enlightened.”

“May I ask why Yang and Fire are uniquely paired?”

“Each qi has its own pairing; it is not Fire alone. Metal and Fire are most closely paired, as the foremost of the Red Emperor. Does not the Heavenly Strategy text state: ‘*Bingwu* and *dingsi* are the ancestral beginning’? ‘Beginning’ means first, foremost, and thus the text speaks of the ancestral beginning. The inception of all things arises from the red heart. The heart illuminates and comprehends all matters. Yang arises within Yin, and it too illuminates. Thus, water is dark externally but bright and illuminating internally, for it contains Yang essence. Therefore, Yang begins in the north, while Yin begins in the south. In the eleventh month, the earth below is warm; in the fifth month, the earth below is cold.”

“Now, why do Yin and Yang originate not in Heaven above but within the midst of Earth?”

“Excellent is your challenging question. Earth is the mother; the father’s essence is bestowed upon the mother, and thus it occurs within Yin. The emanation of Yang essence begins simultaneously in Heaven. Yang, as the transformative inception of qi, is subtle and difficult to perceive. It takes form within Yin and only then becomes visible and manifest. Thus, records note its presence within Yin, not its Yang origin.”

“Today, rain and snow—both manifestations of this transformative Dao—are visible and spoken of. Yet the emanation of Yang essence is imperceptible?”

“Excellent are your words, for they grasp the intent. I wished to explain this to you as a Perfected One, but I feared the great form of the Dao of Heaven would be revealed, and thus I did not speak. Yet I feared you would harbor resentment. It is difficult to be a teacher, to be one who guides others. Please sit calmly, and I will explain subtly. When Heaven creates rain and snow, it is merely the interplay of breath—Yin and Yang unite and emanate, becoming visible at that moment. Heaven’s qi descends, Earth’s qi ascends, and their emanations converge. Thus, rain and snow take form and are visible.”

“May I ask: when mountains crumble and clouds rise, all is visible. Yet you say the emanation is imperceptible—why? I could not help but ask, for my heart was heavy with unease. As a disciple, is it not improper to be immodest? Yet if I do not ask, I cannot attain understanding. Thus, I must ask without hesitation, leaving no doubt.”

“Very well. I will explain subtly, though it cannot be fully exhausted.”

“Now, when clouds and rain cause mountains to crumble, this is the overwhelming fury of Yin, which cannot restrain itself from harming Yang—a transformation of ominous events, not a virtuous change. It injures the Dao of transformation, a failure of Yin, a wound to Yin. True One, do not press further with questions; the Way of Heaven cannot be exhaustively examined or fully spoken. Reflect upon its meaning yourself.”

“Understood, understood.”

“You may go.”

**Daoist Protection: Three Persons’ Parting Words, Two Hundred Thirteen**

The True One bowed again. “I humbly ask the Heavenly Master about the Dao. When the Qi of Great Peace arrives, who is suited for the Dao? Who is not suited for it?”

“Excellent, your question is well put. The Dao and people are like wind and rain: those who practice it prosper, those who do not simply remain as they are. Those who delight in practice are its people; those who do not delight in it are not its people. Those who practice without strain, who find it easy to open and penetrate, are its people. Those who remain closed and impenetrable, achieving nothing all day, are not its people. Practicing brings good fortune; not practicing brings misfortune—such are its people. Those who do not practice yet remain naturally fortunate and free from suffering are not its people. After practicing, if one instead suffers afflictions, they are not its people.

Furthermore, in nurturing oneself, one must examine carefully. The Dao is the tally of the upright person. Illness, demonic influences, and malevolent spirits are the pathways of wickedness, thieves that murder good people. When they see someone about to enter the true Dao, they grow enraged, contend with them, and turn their pursuit of the Dao into misfortune rather than virtue. They feign tranquility among equals—one must be meticulous and refine oneself. Attaining the Dao brings good fortune; losing it brings misfortune. The mandate of life and death cannot be altered carelessly or without careful consideration.”

“Excellent! Excellent! Your foolish disciple now understands.”

“Very well. Since the True One has asked about these matters, I will now impart the essential words of Heaven. The reason my Dao endures and nurtures is that there are those who delight in the Dao, delight in virtue, delight in benevolence, who disregard worldly affairs and seek only to preserve life. The Dao truly endures in nurturing and guarding these two kinds of people. Those who fall below this standard cannot be long nurtured by my Dao.”

“Why is this? The Dao of humanity encompasses all—why does it uniquely favor these three kinds of people and not others?”

“Excellent, your challenging question has grasped the meaning. When the Great Dao emerges, all people receive its grace, even grasses and trees—none fail to be transformed for the good, all attain their proper place, and each fulfills its natural lifespan.

Those without Dao, virtue, or benevolence cannot be long nurtured. Why is this?”

“Because they do not delight in Dao, virtue, or benevolence.”

“Why can those who delight in Dao, virtue, and benevolence alone be long nurtured? I wish to hear the meaning.”

“Ah, you understand the arising of things! Your question touches upon the ultimate secret. Listen carefully, and I will distinguish its meaning for you.”

“Understood, understood.”

“Now, those who delight in Dao, virtue, and benevolence—these three kinds of people each possess the mandate of the Three Powers. Those who delight in the Dao belong to the mandate of Heaven; those who delight in virtue and nurturing belong to the mandate of Earth; those who delight in benevolence belong to the mandate of humanity. These three kinds of people align with the harmony of Yin and Yang, all have their names recorded in the registers. Thus, the myriad spirits of Heaven say my scriptures can nurture them. Those who do not act accordingly have no record in the registers, so my scriptures cannot long nurture them.

Now that the Qi of Great Peace has arrived, there is no partiality, so it does not long nurture the wicked. It is not like the times of internal chaos in the past, when it could encompass and nurture evil people.”

“I wish to hear the full explanation.”

“Very well. When the qi of wickedness and evil arises, it can long nurture evil people but cannot long nurture good people, for their harms are many and the good are few—like the arrival of great cold when the heat wanes. Now that the upright qi has arrived, it cannot long nurture evil people—like the arrival of Yang qi when Yin qi dissipates.

When the great red qi of the Supreme Yang rises, it is the sovereign essence of fire. The sovereign of fire ascends to become the sun. The sun illuminates and examines evil people, so they cannot act wrongly—thus, it does not tolerate evil people.

Moreover, the Dao governs life, virtue governs nurturing, and benevolence governs the application of the heart in love. Spring brings life, summer brings nurturing, and humanity applies the heart to govern and nurture all things. Thus, the Supreme Yang gives life, nurtures, and grows, applying the heart with the greatest toil. This is what is meant.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

“Foolish student, I hear your request again!”
“Very well, sit calmly, and I shall further expound for you.”
“Yes, yes.”

“First, in the study of the Dao, those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the spirits, and those of lesser attainment reside among men. Second, in the study of virtue, those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the spirits, and those of lesser attainment reside among men. Third, in the study of benevolence, those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the spirits, and those of lesser attainment reside among men. Fourth, in the study of office, those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the spirits, and those of lesser attainment reside among men. Fifth, in the love of amassing wealth and property, those who amass greatly reside in Heaven, those who amass moderately reside among the spirits, and those who amass little reside among men.

Thus, in these five matters—whether of great, middling, or lesser attainment—all depend on the devotion of one’s strength: dedicating one’s fate to Heaven, dedicating one’s virtue to Earth, and dedicating one’s benevolence to men. If one guards these three matters in cultivating the self, with a worthy heart and good intentions, pondering and reflecting upon them, the self may be perfected. By accumulating and gathering them, the spirit will naturally arise; by guarding and nurturing them, the Dao will naturally be achieved; by delighting in and cherishing them, the self will naturally flourish.

The Way of Heaven is without partiality or estrangement, bestowing its trust upon the good. Thus, Heaven exerts itself to enact the Dao, completing one cycle each day. The reason for this daily cycle is that all things’ generation follows the six jia, the five phases, and the four seasons. If one qi fails to arrive, things will be incomplete, and their generation will be insufficient and unbalanced. For a ruler, parent, or superior, this imbalance is a grave transgression.

Thus, Heaven completes one cycle each day, personally overseeing its enactment. The reason it personally oversees this enactment is, for example, if you are Water: should the qi of Water be incomplete, the qi of the five phases will be insufficient, and the qi of the four seasons will be unfulfilled. Therefore, it enacts and oversees them. When jia aligns above, there is the phase of Wood and the qi of spring. When bing aligns above, there is the phase of Fire and the qi of summer. When wu aligns above, there is the phase of Earth and the qi of the four seasons’ center. When geng aligns above, there is the phase of Metal and the qi of autumn. When ren aligns above, there is the phase of Water and the qi of winter. When the five phases are complete and the four qi are established, all things may be generated.

When Heaven and Earth’s transformative influence is evenly bestowed, whether noble or base, great or small, all are as one, and there are no disputes. Thus may one be a ruler or parent. Those who embody the Dao, virtue, and benevolence must model themselves on this. Only then may they accord with the will of Heaven; they must not act carelessly or recklessly. The Way of Heaven serves as this model—how much more so for man?

Thus, the superior person models Heaven—this is the Dao! The middling person models Earth—this is virtue! The inferior person models men—this is benevolence! Those who fall below this are no longer among men; they share the impermanent fate of beasts, plants, and trees.

The Perfected One who obtains my writings must deeply ponder their essential meaning. If he follows them without fail, he will harmonize with Heaven and share its work. Those who oppose my writings are the enemies of Heaven and Earth, and I will not tolerate them. What my writings detest is precisely what is right. Perfected One, be cautious, and transmit this to the superior person, return it to the authorities, and show it to ordinary people. From this day forward, Heaven differs from ancient times.”

“Excellent! Excellent!”

Here follows the Right Section distinguishing the proper and improper applications of the *Taiping* texts—*The Comprehensive Collation of the Taiping Jing*, volumes 120 to 136, Xin section, unnumbered scrolls; *Excerpts from the Taiping Jing*, Xin section.

Someone asked: To be sated without eating, to enjoy long life and enduring existence—this is the Way to enrich the state and preserve the people.

If one wishes to cease eating, one must first employ the method of guiding life, placing it foremost, and thereby retain qi. After ingesting qi-nourishing medicines, one feels slight hunger on the third day, mild hunger on the seventh, and by the tenth day, one achieves small success without doubt—having left death to join life. After ingesting qi-nourishing medicines, for all solid and difficult-to-digest foods, one meal suffices as the measure. For formless foods, moderation in small amounts is best. Beyond a hundred days, one may cease eating entirely—this is called the inexhaustible Way, the means to assist the state in nourishing the people and aid Heaven and Earth as the masters of sustenance. Too little is auspicious; too much is inauspicious; complete abstention is also inauspicious, for it obstructs the intestines. The method for unblocking the intestines: one meal is proper; two meals are excessive; three meals are inferior; four meals distend the intestines; five meals bring great hunger; six meals invite great misfortune, and from this arise a hundred illnesses, leading to death in years of great famine.

After regulating food for a thousand days, the large and small intestines are fully filled, never to be depleted. All illnesses depart, one’s complexion improves, and nothing is forbidden. In ancient times, those who attained the Dao all did so by ceasing to eat. Rulers, ministers, and common people can thereby secure body and mind, fulfill their duties, the wealthy can preserve their wealth, and the poor can sustain their lives. The superior person who practices this thrives in good years and avoids peril in bad ones.

People say there are three lives, yet they do not know it: daily three meals sustain life. Skipping breakfast severs one life; skipping lunch severs two; skipping dinner severs all three. Going three days without food severs nine lives. Hoarding goods and treasuring wealth arise from hunger. Great deceit and wickedness all begin here.

By employing this Way, all affairs regulate themselves. In auspicious years, one can promote prosperity; in inauspicious years, one can preserve the people. One should always lightly bind the intestines to facilitate movement.

Between Heaven and Earth, all things possess their own spirit. Radiance ascends to Heaven, becoming stars by which one may observe safety and danger. The nature of Heaven and Earth has its own patterns and laws—six jia, five phases, four seasons, and seasonal measures—by which one may divine and foresee future events, remedy decline and disorder, and prevent what has not yet occurred.

In seven matters, a minister observes the ruler’s decline and rescues him, restoring his prosperity—this is a great merit. Knowing the decline yet failing to rescue it, or instead speaking ill and departing, is called inciting calamity, and the guilt is ineradicable.

In the second matter, a minister knows the ruler’s faults, foresees impending harm, and rescues him, averting misfortune—this is a great merit. Knowing yet failing to rescue is called inciting misfortune, and the guilt is ineradicable.

In the third matter, a minister knows the ruler has lost the essential meaning of governance, with disasters arising in succession, and assists in rectifying it—this is proper. As an enlightened minister, knowing yet failing to rescue incurs ineradicable guilt.

In the fourth matter, a minister knows the ruler is young and his virtue insufficient for governance, and rescues him, aiding his understanding—this is proper. Knowing yet failing to assist in cultivating virtue, instead claiming incompetence, is called disloyalty, weakening one’s superior, and the guilt is ineradicable.

In the fifth matter, a minister knows the ruler is aged, nearing the end of his Heaven-appointed span, and worries for him, seeking extraordinary methods and great worthies to assist, offering unusual strategies and inner texts, enabling the ruler to extend his years—this is a great merit. Knowing yet failing to act, instead speaking of fortune and misfortune, incurs great fault.

In the sixth matter, as a subordinate, one knows one’s superior is in danger, has lost proper governance, or has forgotten something, and jointly rescues and rectifies it—this is a great merit. Knowing yet failing to rescue, excusing oneself and departing, is to be an unfilial and disloyal person, and the guilt extends to one’s descendants.

In the seventh matter, when parents are ill, one divines and observes, exhausting all effort and spirit to rescue them. Knowing yet failing to rescue brings great punishment from Heaven.

In the eighth matter, when parents are aged and nearing the end, as a child one knows their time is approaching and seeks worthy teachers and extraordinary methods to restore their vigor—this is the duty of a filial child. This is like consuming another’s food and returning it as sustenance, and it is a great merit.

In the ninth matter, knowing someone faces decline, great harm, or impending suffering, one rescues them, restoring their prosperity, offering unusual strategies, inner texts, and good deeds to eliminate their worries—this is a great merit. Knowing yet failing to act incurs ineradicable guilt.

As a child, to abandon parents in their hour of mortal peril, seeking comfort while shunning hardship, is to be no different from beasts and plants. How can one govern the Three Powers or succeed Heaven and Earth?

Thus, when sages emerge, they enact teachings and admonitions, exhorting people to goodness, cutting off wickedness, and rescuing Heaven and Earth from disaster, so that the Three Luminaries, Five Phases, and stars proceed in proper order. Is this mere empty talk?

Now, the texts above have fully emerged to transform and eliminate all disasters, bringing about goodness. Therefore, I myself enlighten and instruct the Perfected to reveal these writings. Now, the heavens above teach me great words, forbidding concealment or secrecy.

Now, Heaven and Earth have completed a great cycle and begun anew. Disasters and harms are about to vanish, leaving no remnants. Thus, people are taught to compile and collate ancient and modern texts, selecting the good to form the *Scripture of the Utmost Depth*, establishing goodness that cannot be altered again. Even sages and worthies cannot surpass its words.

These words are the language of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. Thus, rulers and worthies are taught and admonished, urged to diligently practice and bring about the Great Peace.

Thus, when it speaks of concealment, it means that the worthy ruler, having obtained these teachings, conceals them within his heart to apply them throughout the world, nurturing the myriad things to bring about the Great Peace. Attributing merit to the Supreme Emperor, they are then secured in stone chambers and deep caves. Heaven generates good things, which must be returned to good places. Like pearls and jade, they are treasured by emperors and kings. Coarse and vile things, however, are discarded by the multitude. How much more does Heaven cherish those who do good? How could emperors and kings not hold them in esteem?

Now, above is the Heaven of the Utmost Limit, at the center is the Heaven of the Utmost Limit, below is the Heaven of the Utmost Limit, and extending in all directions is the Heaven of the Utmost Limit. Today, the law is established, and moreover, the three Dao gather qi to deliberate together, corresponding to the positions of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. When the Great Peace arrives, Heaven rejoices, and the emperor’s longevity is assured. The Dao of the numinous spirits protects Heaven and Earth; good qi responds without fail. Virtue and power arrive daily, while deceit and falsehood retreat, and inauspicious ministers and treacherous officials perish. All corrupt ministers are eradicated, and the myriad virtues arise of their own accord. The Five Phases harmonize, and the four qi align with the seasons.

In governance and law, one must begin with the root. The root lies in the human image of the spirits between Heaven and Earth. The spirits resemble humans, each possessing their own domain. They gather and assess the good and evil, the likes and dislikes, the joys and sufferings of villages, districts, towns, and counties, each according to its root. Matters are examined closely, and their strengths and weaknesses, gains and losses, are as clear as the sun and moon. Thus, great teachings assemble deliberations, where the worthy and the unworthy together balance affairs.

Therefore, in every prefecture, county, town, and village under Heaven, seals are placed, and the myriad people are encouraged to write according to their abilities, speaking directly of their sufferings, benefits, harms, and preferences. They submit their writings into the sealed receptacles. Local officials then compile and present them to the Son of Heaven, allowing him to know the people’s likes and dislikes, worthiness and unworthiness, benefits and harms, so that they may be deliberated and governed. When this is done, the qi of Great Peace arrives, blessing the state, the ruler, and the myriad people, and the twelve thousand things each find their proper place. The seal is what is now called the *guǐhán* (the sealed petition box).

The Dao of Heaven has its slow and swift moments, and human affairs are likewise slow or swift. When the Dao of Heaven is swift, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning arrive without delay. When human affairs are urgent, they too are addressed without delay. Urgent matters are promptly reported in accordance with Heaven’s laws, with one copy submitted and another returned to the original office, where rewards and punishments are meted out. Slower matters are to be reported within eight months, as a single day in Heaven’s law. Such is the law of yin and yang, and so too is the Dao of humanity.

Within each person’s abdomen resides a Son of Heaven, and the five qi each have their rulers. Heaven has the five qi, and Earth has the five positions. One qi governs movement, and the ruler governs the execution of justice. All matters reside within the human abdomen, where the heart is named. The heart is the ruler of the five viscera, the root of the spirit, and the essence of the body. It governs the execution of goodness and does not delight in reckless internal deceit or evil. If a person can uphold goodness, dwell in clarity and stillness, refrain from reckless external pursuits, and align inwardly with the ruler within, this is called clarity that returns to behold the heart. The heart is the ruler; when one meets it, life is prolonged, and all affairs are governed rightly. Those who fail to meet the ruler are all deceived; they no longer communicate with the ruler, and all their affairs go awry, leading to early death.

Now, the virtue of the Great Yang is flourishing, desiring that above and below, within and beyond the heavens, there be no bounds. The true spirits and true essences radiate their light to assist the emperor in governance, bringing forth the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Utmost Peace, which has never before been seen. The lives of good people are prolonged, and the myriad things no longer suffer untimely deaths or self-inflicted injustices. Malevolent spirits vanish entirely, and there are no more cases of oppression or illness under Heaven. How could this not be heard?

Excellent is your question! Heaven commands the complete eradication of deceit, falsehood, and vicious evil, revealing true affairs. All paintings and diagrams possess their own spirits: true affairs have true spirits, false affairs have false spirits, good affairs have good spirits, and evil affairs have evil spirits. Those who accumulate falsehoods will inevitably suffer harm, while those who accumulate true texts and the true Dao will later achieve transcendence. Thus, truth and falsehood each manifest according to their essence.

Heaven has the auspicious and the inauspicious: the auspicious has auspicious spirits, and the inauspicious has inauspicious spirits. Earth likewise has the auspicious and the inauspicious: the auspicious has auspicious spirits, and the inauspicious has inauspicious spirits. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors each had their kin and brothers, as did the Three Kings and Five Hegemons. Minor distinctions follow their kind: when the age flourishes, they rise; when the age declines, they fall. Like day and night, they follow one another in succession, continuing without cease from the opening of yin and yang to the present. The poor become petty men, and the rich become noble men, alternating in their governance and management. This is the kinship of Heaven and Earth. Though the myriad things do not arise, some resemble them in form, yet they are not the same.

Heaven has the six jia, the four seasons, the Five Phases, the firm and the yielding, the female and the male, the first, middle, and last months, all forming kin and brothers, revered and served without fail to transform the world. They are made to govern with goodness, and benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, culture, and martiality become kin and brothers in turn. The Dao and the Dao are kin and brothers: all Dao ultimately unite as one, mutually proving and generating one another. Today, if one’s body has attained the Dao, all Daoists come forth, and kindred spirits unite as one family, all harboring good intentions. Great and small no longer harm one another, and disasters and calamities depart without trace. If the emperor practices this, the world flourishes. He governs effortlessly, transcends the world, and enjoys long life. If officials and people practice it, governance becomes daily clearer. All Dao emerge, and none fail to radiate light. The Dao and the Dao transmit and practice together as kin. Thus, summoning the Dao with the Dao and seeking the Dao with the Dao, the Dao becomes kin and brothers. When transformation reaches such a state, the world cherishes life and detests killing. How could there be those without the Dao?

When virtue unites with virtue as kin and brothers, if one’s body today embodies great virtue and takes virtue as its intent, all virtuous people defer and serve one another with humility, and all virtuous people in the world emerge. Taking this as the rule, one sits at ease without trouble. If the emperor practices it, his state prospers; if officials and people practice it, nothing remains ungoverned. Summoning virtue with virtue, virtue comes of itself.

When benevolence unites with benevolence as kin and brothers, if one’s body today embodies benevolence, all benevolent people come seeking one another. Summoning benevolence with benevolence, all benevolent people come forth. If the emperor practices it, the world becomes wholly benevolent; if officials and people practice it, none fail to cherish one another. This is what it means for benevolence to unite as one family—kin and brothers.

When rightness unites with rightness as kin and brothers, summoning rightness with rightness, if one’s body today has attained rightness, all people of rightness come to submit, for they unite through rightness. If the emperor practices it, suffering and joy are evenly divided; if officials and people practice it, life and harm are evenly split. Summoning rightness with rightness—this is kin and brothers.

When ritual unites with ritual as kin and brothers, summoning ritual with ritual, if one’s body today has attained ritual, all people of ritual come forth. Those who practice it uphold restraint; the living are not at ease. Within, the belly is empty; without, one moves as if encircled, rushing, bowing, rising—never hearing commands. Days grow short, and clothing becomes threadbare. If the emperor practices it, he is beset by sorrow and vexation; if officials and people practice it, duties multiply endlessly. The strong grow weary, and the old and weak strain their sinews. Ritual uniting with ritual—this is kin and brothers.

When culture unites with culture as kin and brothers, if one today has attained culture, summoning culture with culture, cultured people come like floating clouds, accumulating within and without like mountains. If sincerity is lacking, great deceit arises. If the emperor practices it, he governs with mixed success; if officials and people practice it, they deceive one another, vainly posturing, giving rise to countless harms, illnesses, and calamities—people’s lives grow ever shorter. Expecting culture from one another, threatening one another with culture, they take and generate endlessly—this is the kinship of culture.

When martial force unites with martial force as kin and brothers, if one today has attained martial force, summoning martial force with martial force, all martial people gather. Their qi is fierce and blazing, their weapons gleaming, their strength doubled, their eyes wide and glaring, their rage uncontrollable. Martial spirits dwell at their flanks, seeking only victory, sparing no thought for their lives. If a noble ruler practices it, his governance grows daily more violent; if officials and people practice it, they destroy and slaughter the world. No goodwill remains, and governance breeds only harm—this is martial force generating martial force, the kinship of martial force.

When eloquence unites with eloquence as kin and brothers, if one today has attained great eloquence, all eloquent people come to submit. Eloquence begets eloquence without end: one word becomes a hundred, a hundred become a thousand, a thousand become ten thousand. Words flow ceaselessly, tongues tangled in chaos, with no truth to be found. If the ruler practices it, his governance becomes boundlessly complex; officials and people have no place to entrust their lives.

When eloquence seeks eloquence, they become kin and brothers. When laws unite with laws as kin and brothers, today they have become the law. Seeking law through law, all those of the law in the world gather. Matters great and small all have governance, and there are no people without guilt. From birth to old age, how many transgressions does a single person commit? There are none without guilt. When people are thus generated from one another, nineteen out of twenty noble men meet violent deaths. Using this to govern the world, great chaos cannot be stopped. When kin and brothers seek one another, each follows its kind. The root of order and disorder, the foundation of Great Peace—examining these nine matters, one may know.

The gods in heaven say: Those who delight in practicing the Dao, the qi of the Dao of Heaven and Earth emerges to assist them; those who delight in practicing virtue, the qi of virtue assists them; those who practice benevolence, Heaven bestows the qi of benevolence to assist them; those who practice righteousness, Heaven bestows the qi of righteousness to assist them; those who practice ritual, Heaven bestows the qi of ritual to assist them; those who practice culture, Heaven bestows the qi of culture to assist them; those who practice eloquence, the qi of eloquence also assists them; those who practice law, the qi of law also assists them. Heaven and Earth each act through their kinds with divine efficacy. When Heaven is about to assist them, spirits and deities hasten to them. Deeply pondering their essential meaning, the qi of Great Peace can be immediately attained.

I ask: Is supreme goodness easy to achieve, or is supreme evil easy to achieve? The extreme of yang is goodness; the extreme of yin is evil. The extreme of yang gives birth to immortals; the extreme of yin kills beings—these are the extremes of yin and yang.

Now, the common people in life cannot exhaust their efforts to nourish their parents, yet they seek rare methods and Daoist arts to provide for their parents, causing them to harbor sorrow until death. They then teach one another to enjoy fine clothing, food, singing, and dancing to please them—these are the people of great rebellion. How could Heaven bless them?

Heaven above emulates the written words of the mortal world. Today, Heaven has established a law forbidding celestial beings from conspiring in deceit, for there are great arts to this. The same holds true on Earth. Do the perfected ones of today know this?

From ancient times to the present, there have been many flattering ministers and deceitful men who manipulate rhetoric to jointly deceive their superiors, distressing their lord and father to obtain office. They consume emoluments without merit before Heaven and Earth. Heaven deeply abhors them; Earth deeply detests them. In Heaven, they are named "disruptors of order." Today, the qi of equanimity from Heaven is about to sever them, yet it fears these men will again disrupt governance.

People today accumulate folly, and many can be deceived into obtaining office. But today’s celestial disasters cannot be deceived and averted, nor can they be eliminated through fraud and pretense. The true and the false resonate with Heaven. If I do not fully reveal this to the people of later ages and test its use, disasters and harms will all be eliminated—this is the true scripture of mine, resonating with the laws of Heaven above. There can be no doubt.

If I do not speak yet the opposite is said to be manifestly clear, or if it is used without success, then my Dao is false—this, too, would be manifest without words.

Heaven’s law does not emulate clever words but emulates success and accomplishment. It is like sitting facing the sun or moon, both possessing light and brightness. How does one know their heat and clarity? They are too distant from people. How to verify this? The master lies in success: sitting facing the sun, one knows warmth; sitting facing the moon, one knows clarity. My true scripture is also like this.

Heaven’s law: when the eyes are open, one governs yang; when closed, one governs yin. When open, one governs the formed; when closed, one governs the formless. When open, one governs the human body; when closed, one governs the spirit. Using this as verification, one can govern both yin and yang completely, so there are no derelictions of duty. The same holds true on Earth, achieving the ultimate, imperial, and equitable.

Today, the books that emerge from Heaven, the divine strategies and sacred talismans that emerge from spirits, the writings and scriptures composed by sages, and the words of the highest worthies—these are all words. Thus, the gods, sages, and superior scholars of Heaven and Earth exert themselves for humanity, accumulating words over the years. They can establish Heaven and Earth and eliminate disasters and harms. When emperors and kings follow and employ them, they attain carefree wandering without affairs, ascend to immortality and increase their years, gain Heaven’s favor, and their descendants continue without end. When the world declines, they can again bring about great flourishing. The world looks up to their mandate, and none fail to attain the six directions, eight distant reaches, and the utmost depths of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang are both pleased, Heaven’s illnesses and untimely winds and rains cease, thunder and lightning do not arise, the sun and moon grow brighter, the Three Luminaries do not lose their courses, the four seasons and five phases proceed in order, each attaining its place. This is the achievement of the sacred and good words—how great is their merit!

The heavens above are each distinct, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The boundless Three Luminaries of Heaven are each distinct, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The central abodes of Heaven are each distinct, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved.

The sounds, echoes, thunder, and lightning of Heaven are each distinct, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The winds and rains of the world are each distinct, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved.

At the center of the world, the winds and clouds each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The people upon the earth each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The crawling creatures upon the earth each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The grasses and trees upon the earth each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The mountains and hills upon the earth each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The rivers, valleys, waters, and marshes upon the earth each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. What lies beneath the earth each differs, possessing its own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The boundless yin and yang beneath the earth each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The Five Phases each differ, possessing their own natural qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The four seasons each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The Six Jia and Ten Stems each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The Six Jia and Twelve Branches each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The eight directions each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my written words, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved. The spirits and numina each differ, possessing their own natural primordial qi of yin and yang, resembling my scripture. Each follows its customs, records my words of good and evil, and practices them—then Great Peace is achieved.

If they do not follow the teachings of their original kind, great chaos ensues. Take heed of this!

Heaven commanded me to fully expound this text to resolve the afflictions of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, emperors and people, and the myriad things. All the sufferings of the people and the myriad things shall be dispelled. Thus, I teach you to employ the boundless method to demonstrate it, having examined and collated the sacred texts of former sages and worthies, as well as the common words of ordinary people. When this is thoroughly investigated, the afflictions of Heaven and Earth shall all be dispelled. Once dispelled, the emperor’s years shall be prolonged, and he shall govern with ease, free from worry.

Heaven is the Great Yang. Earth is the Great Yin. Humans dwell at the center, and the myriad things are likewise. Heaven constantly descends and bestows, its qi flowing downward. Earth constantly ascends and seeks, its qi rising to meet. The two qi intersect at the center. Humans, dwelling therein, are upright. The two qi constantly interact and operate, converging at the center to jointly generate the myriad things. All things receive these two qi to take form, uniting to become their nature and disposition. Without these two qi, they cannot be born or completed. Thus, the lives of the myriad things are bound to these two qi, which intermingle within their forms.

Therefore, when one does good, Heaven and Earth know it; when one does evil, Heaven and Earth also know it. Thus, the ancient people of utmost virtue and power inwardly knew the will of Heaven alone, and so they always acted rightly in doing good.

The celestial prognostication states: "What returns to joy is joy; what returns to goodness is goodness; what returns to evil is evil; what returns to delight is delight; what returns to compliance is compliance; what returns to truth is truth; what returns to the Dao is the Dao; what returns to pleasure is pleasure." Whatever returns, Heaven and Earth and the host of spirits likewise return in echo!

"What returns to refinement returns refinement; what returns to falsehood returns falsehood; what returns to eloquence returns eloquence; what returns to flattery returns flattery; what returns to martiality returns martiality; what returns to rebellion returns rebellion; what returns to misfortune returns misfortune; what returns to depravity returns depravity." Whatever returns, Heaven and Earth and the host of spirits all return it. All the principles of fortune and misfortune, safety and danger lie in what is returned.

Those whose households are strong often amass private wealth, yet later they often suffer poverty and misfortune. Why is this? The divine beings say: This is because some, though wise, deceive those who are lacking; some, though strong, bully the weak; some, though young, disrespect the old—all these are acts of rebellion. Thus, Heaven does not long protect them. Why? The wise should nurture the foolish, yet they deceive them—this is the first rebellion. The strong should support the weak, yet they bully them—this is the second rebellion. The young should care for the old, yet they disrespect them—this is the third rebellion. This is contrary to the heart of Heaven, and thus misfortune must follow.

Wealth is the surplus of Heaven and Earth. It is like water, which constantly flows and follows, always humbly dwelling below. Those who obtain much wealth are those who are humble and thus gain more. Those who are greedy, however, are not protected by Heaven.

Ever since the loss of the harmonious Dao of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the Three Methods, Heaven has accumulated excess calculations, hoarding without bestowing. Why is this? I wish to hear the reason. Now, Heaven’s mandate: the superior reckoning is one hundred and thirty, which is called the surplus of the yang calendar.

The next is one hundred and twenty, called the remainder of the year-count after removing the cycle. The next is one hundred years, called the harmonious calendar’s alignment with the cycle of things. All people should model their years upon this. Since the loss of the Three Methods, many have not completed their allotted years. The surplus reckoning is one year per unit, recorded in Heaven, yet those who act contrary to the Dao of Heaven cannot claim it. Now, those who emulate my teachings and perform good deeds—Heaven will bestow this surplus reckoning upon them, increasing their years, some attaining transcendence, others prolonging their lives.

Since the time when Heaven and Earth [lacuna], emperors and kings have been solely concerned with the inequity of the world, grieving over the loss of proper order. Without this, there would be no cause for sorrow. The world’s good people, loyal ministers, and filial children all share this concern. Yet by practicing my teachings, this sorrow will be dispelled.

Heaven declares: when yang qi flourishes greatly, ghostly beings cannot act recklessly to harm. Why is this? When yang is abundant, yin must wane, so such beings cannot act recklessly—who restrains them? The essence of yang restrains them. How does the essence of yang restrain them? The essence of yang is spirit, belonging to Heaven, associated with red, and governing the heart. The heart-spirit is the spirit of Heaven. Essence is the essence of Earth. Ghosts are the ghosts of humans. Earth is the mother; ghosts are the child. Mother and child follow the same law, dwelling together in the path of yin. When the qi of Great Peace arrives and yang qi flourishes greatly, the Dao of Heaven is stern, and the Dao of spirits is luminous. When luminous, Heaven enables humans to employ it together with the spirits. When the Dao of spirits is employed, it descends to dissolve the path of ghostly beings. When the Dao of spirits flourishes, it aligns with the noble person. The path of ghostly beings aligns with the petty person. Thus, the noble person governs with impartiality, and the spirits likewise govern with impartiality. The petty person governs with deceit, and ghostly beings likewise govern with deceit—clearly, they belong to the same kind.

Now, when the Dao of yang flourishes like fire, weapons and blades will be dissolved, for fire suppresses them. Thus, when weapons accumulate, yin qi is abundant; when fire accumulates, yang qi is abundant. When yang is abundant, it dissolves weapons—this is the natural response. Human life must rely on Heaven’s qi. The most virtuous are entrusted to Heaven, the moderately virtuous to humanity, and the least virtuous to the fields. Therefore, the superior scholar studies to transcend the world; the middling scholar governs the people; the inferior scholar tends the fields and wilds. The superior scholar will come with cloudy qi, the middling scholar rides in a carriage, and the inferior scholar walks. These three types have distinct duties and do not interfere with one another. The superior scholar transcends the world and ascends to Heaven, regulating the winds and rains of harmony; the middling scholar serves as an official, governing the people; the inferior scholar manages property—each has their role and does not interfere.

In the methods of those who study the Dao in Heaven, one must diligently seek the Dao. A small alignment with the lesser Dao allows one to perceive minor spirits and attain minor attainment; the gateway has not yet aligned with the middle Dao, and thus one may progress to the great Dao. Only by reaching the great Dao can one attain the true spirit. Those who align with the lesser Dao attain minor spirits; those who align with the middle Dao attain middling spirits; those who align with the great Dao attain great spirits. Only when the great spirit arrives can one transcend the world and endure forever. Yet even here, there are great demonic spirits and ghosts that do not wish for humans to transcend the world, seeking to delude them into negligence, causing them to retreat and speak of strange transformations, mingling truth with falsehood. Only by distinguishing between the upright and the perverse at this stage can one transcend the world.

In Heaven, the superior scholar, from birth to death, harbors not a single evil thought and is thus beloved by all people. The officials of the four directions and the five regions bestow gifts upon them. The middling scholar is beloved by their neighbors, who together bestow gifts upon them. The inferior scholar, lacking any virtuous intention, receives no gifts but instead secretly takes from their own household to give to others. This is the conduct of the worthless in the world. What is meant by "worthless"? The superior scholar is purely good, their heart free of evil—this is the highest yang. The middling scholar’s heart is half good—this is the middle yang. The inferior scholar’s heart is entirely devoid of goodness—this is the lowest yang, hence called "worthless." Worthless things do not come to fruition, hollow within and without grain, for they lack true sincerity. Those without sincerity are called worthless people.

The gifts bestowed upon the superior scholar’s household by officials from the four directions signify that they do not forget their ancestral origins. The gifts bestowed upon the middling scholar’s household by their four neighbors signify that they do not forget their parents. The inferior scholar, however, secretly takes from their own household to give to others, resembling the worthless—hollow within yet outwardly full, turning their back on their roots. All such actions harm Heaven above, for they turn their back on their household, causing disharmony within. It is from such people that all troubles arise.

When a minister engages in external alliances, their state will surely be emptied; when a household member engages in external alliances, their household will surely be emptied. Heaven’s censure arises from this. For peace and peril originate within the human heart, and the divine and numinous are perceived from afar. Above and below, in all directions, they penetrate countless miles—can one not be cautious?

The Way of Great Peace is concise in its teachings, enriches the state, is Heaven’s mandate, and the treasure of the self. Emerging from the heart and mind, it circulates throughout the world. By practicing these teachings, the state may be secured, and the household enriched. The laws of Heaven and Earth decree that the good govern the evil, the upright govern the perverse, and the pure govern the turbid. One cannot allow the evil to govern the good, the perverse to govern the upright, or the turbid to govern the pure. To reverse this is to invite unending banditry, daily growing deceit, and ultimately great chaos—all arising from this.

When emperors and kings appoint ministers, they must carefully consider their selection, aligning with the heart of Heaven. Only when the constellations align may one dare to appoint them. The sun represents the virtue of the ruler; the moon represents the virtue of the minister. If the constellations do not align, one cannot achieve Great Peace, and deceit will arise.

What do the post stations and lodgings of the eight directions—above and below, central and peripheral—wear, eat, and rest upon? Those who practice virtue and morality yet harbor doubts may resolve them through this prophecy. Today, in Heaven, there are official lodgings and post stations to await and house travelers; on Earth, there are official lodgings and post stations to await and house travelers; and in the eight directions and the center, all have them.

The celestial official lodgings house divine immortals. The earthly official lodgings house sages and worthies. The subterranean official lodgings house the virtuous spirits and benevolent ghosts of the Great Yin. The official lodgings of the eight directions—near and far, in famous mountains and great rivers—house the spiritual beings and immortals between Heaven and Earth who have yet to ascend. Within clouds and winds dwell the Northern Culmen and Kunlun. The official lodgings and post stations await the arrival of sages, worthies, and meritorious spirits.

The Dao is the head, virtue the belly, and benevolence the feet by which one walks. Heaven establishes official lodgings and post stations, and those who attain them may dwell therein. Those who seek the power of Heaven must practice the Dao; those who seek the power of Earth must practice virtue; those who seek the power of humanity must practice benevolence. These three are the inexhaustible Way. To lose them is the root of chaos; to disregard them is to rebel against Heaven. Thus, the sage embraces the Dao, practices virtue, and acts with benevolence. To go beyond this is to enter the realm of the myriad things.

May I ask: which spirits of the four seasons’ qi assist in governance, bringing forth goodness and eliminating evil? Which summon the great spirits? Which summon the middling spirits? Which summon the lesser spirits? Contemplating the imperial qi of the sun’s essence and the moon’s establishment summons the great spirits; contemplating the ministerial qi summons the middling spirits; contemplating the destructive qi summons the lesser spirits; contemplating the aged qi following the moon’s establishment summons old beings; contemplating the ailing and declining qi following the moon’s establishment summons malevolent ghosts; contemplating the dead qi following the moon’s establishment summons pure ghosts; contemplating the broken qi following the moon’s establishment summons ruin, slaughter, misfortune, and harm.

The generative qi belongs to Heaven, to yang, to what lies ahead. The Dao of Heaven generates through the qi of spirits, thus the six spirits before the Dipper are all generative. The six spirits behind belong to Earth, to yin. The Dao of Heaven takes dead qi as ghosts, as the misfortune and harm of beings. If you wish for later generations to remain ever cautious and ever faithful, to cherish and love themselves, so that the numinous spirits and essence-qi never depart from their bodies, they will neither know old age nor death.

The numinous spirits and essence-qi move with one’s intentions and never leave the body. If the numinous spirits remain constant, one does not fall ill or age, and one’s journeys do not encounter evil. If the numinous spirits depart, the sick die at once, and travelers meet with misfortune—this is the great proof. Those who wish to avoid illness should guard their essence with care.

In all things, do not exceed the natural. Within the natural, there is no essence-spirit. In all things, if one does not become spirit, one does not transcend the great Dao and the nature of Heaven and Earth. Without great essence-spirit at the center, nothing can be accomplished, nor can one preserve oneself. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth relies on essence-spirit to act naturally. Therefore, in all things, great or small, there is essence-spirit: the great have great essence-spirit, the small have small essence-spirit. Each preserves and nurtures its own essence-spirit, and thus endures long.

When essence-spirit wanes, one ages; when essence-spirit perishes, one dies—this is the natural division. How can one forcibly contend against it? The safety or peril of all things lies in essence-spirit. Thus, the body is the home, qi the carriage and horse, and essence-spirit the magistrate. Prosperity and decline, coming and going, are governed by it. A body without essence-spirit is like a field, estate, or walled city without a magistrate. The magistrate is the arbiter of life for the people—this is the path for loyal ministers, filial children, and those who embody great compliance.

If one’s body is disloyal to superiors and unfilial to parents, it betrays itself, invites punishment, and loses its foundation. Constantly contemplating goodness, essence-spirit gathers and follows; contemplating evil, essence-spirit also gathers and follows. It enters the belly, moving with one’s thoughts, causing restlessness and obsession.

[Question:] The child in the womb does not eat but draws qi. Within the womb, it is the qi of the natural. After birth, it inhales and exhales the qi of yin and yang. By guarding the Dao and cultivating learning, one returns to the qi of the natural. Returning to the qi of the natural, the heart becomes like an infant’s—then one is born. Following the inhalation and exhalation of yin and yang qi, one dies.

[Note:] The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: May I ask why the child in the womb does not eat but draws qi? The Dao of Heaven possesses the qi of the natural and the qi of ebb and flow. While in the womb, the child receives qi—this is the qi of the natural Dao of Heaven. After birth, it breathes in and out the qi of yin and yang—this is the qi of ebb and flow. Those who guard the Dao and cultivate learning return to the qi of the natural and live; those who cling to the qi of ebb and flow die.

Thus, those who attain the true Dao can internalize qi and no longer rely on external qi. By using this internal qi to nurture their nature, they can return to infancy and restore their life. Therefore, one should practice internal qi to nourish the body within.

[Citation:] The *Three Caverns Pearl Satchel*, in the chapter "On Abstaining from Grain" from *Scroll Four*, quotes the *Scripture of Great Peace*, *Scroll 120*: "Thus, those who eat have a limited lifespan; those who do not eat consult with the spirits. Those who eat qi achieve clarity of spirit; those who neither drink nor eat complete their years with Heaven and Earth."

*Combined Collation of the Scripture of Great Peace*, *Scrolls 137–153*, *Ren Section* (undivided); *Excerpts from the Scripture of Great Peace*, *Ren Section*.

All people are incapable of restraining one another, and thus each shapes their own fate. Those who do evil will be punished by Heaven. Therefore, petty persons are punished by mediocre ones, mediocre ones by superior ones, and superior ones by the great. Even minor transgressions against the law lead to peril and ruin. The punishments of spirits and deities, great and small, follow the same principle. If one cannot restrain oneself, Heaven will surely punish them.

Heaven reveres the Dao, and the Dao reveres spontaneity. Heaven reveres the Dao because it embodies the utmost conduct. If the Dao is abandoned and not practiced, the Way of Heaven falls into chaos and ruin. When the Way of Heaven is in chaos and ruin, peril and destruction follow, and no laws or standards remain. Thus, spontaneity ensures that the Dao of Heaven and Earth is preserved. When the Dao is practiced without cease, yin and yang transmit and beget one another in succession. The Dao governs life; if the Dao is severed, the myriad things will not be born. If the myriad things are not born, there will be no generations, nothing to transmit. If the myriad things do not transmit and beget one another, all will perish. How then could Heaven and Earth endure? Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, must transmit and beget one another. If this ceases, they will perish. Thus, Heaven fears the severing of the Dao and the ensuing peril and ruin.

The Dao reveres spontaneity because without spontaneity, the Way of Heaven cannot be accomplished. Therefore, all things are accomplished only through spontaneity; without it, nothing can be truly achieved. Even if something is accomplished, it will be false and deceptive, and such accomplishments cannot endure. Though Heaven and Earth are vast and distant from one another, their governance of fate leaves no escape.

Someone asks: "When the qi of Great Peace arrives in full, and one wishes to constantly eliminate wickedness with good intentions, what should be prioritized?"

The answer: "The nature of Heaven and Earth is half yang and half yin. Yang is good and governs rewards and bestowals. Yin is evil; evil leads to punishments and penalties, governing deceit and falsehood. When rewards are many and punishments few, deceitful and cunning individuals proliferate, and the gates of wickedness open wide. The reason for this is that excessive punishments, which govern killing and harm, turn lawbreakers into wicked criminals, thus opening the gates of wickedness and increasing deceit.

Yang governs rewards and bestowals. When bestowals are abundant, virtue and power prevail. Yang and virtue govern nurturing and life—this is the law of spontaneity. Thus, day is yang, the sun, the ruler, and virtue; night is yin, the moon, the minister, and deceit. The nature of Heaven and Earth is half good and half evil. Therefore, the noble person, being supremely good, suppresses wickedness. Those who promote good receive good; those who promote evil receive evil. This is like using a *dou* to measure against another *dou*—what is not a *dou* naturally falls away; using a *chi* to measure against another *chi*—what is not a *chi* naturally drops off. It is like the square and the round, which do not align; the compass and the carpenter’s square, which do not meet; the vertical and the horizontal, which do not coincide. Thus, when yang arises, it moves in accord with its kind.

When fire blazes, thunder roars, and the Vermilion Bird appears within. This is why thunder occurs in summer and hides in winter. All things follow their roots—only thus can the Way of Heaven be understood. Without following their kind, how could the sage and the worthy deeply comprehend it? Therefore, since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the goodness, evil, truth, and falsehood of people can be observed through their actions. By seeking their kind, one can foretell their success or failure, their gains and losses, and discern the worthy from the unworthy. Why engage in futile disputes?"

Someone asks: "From ancient times to the present, the worthy, the enlightened, the wise, the eloquent, the strong, and the brave—these six types of people all possess talents a myriad times greater than others. How could they be anything but good?"

The answer: "These six types of people indeed possess talents a myriad times greater than others. If their talents harmonize with Heaven and Earth, preventing the rise of all evil and harmful influences, enabling the emperor to live long without worry, and allowing themselves to dispel illness and live out their natural years, their benevolence flowing to all people—then the worthy, enlightened, wise, eloquent, strong, and brave are truly good and beneficial.

Yet if they cannot harmonize with Heaven and Earth, if the emperor remains burdened with worries and does not live long, if they themselves suffer from illness, cannot dispel disasters, or die prematurely, no different from ordinary people—then these six types of people are of no benefit. One need only examine their accomplishments. Those who succeed are right; those who do not are wrong. If their actions align with this principle, they deeply accord with the will of August Heaven. The emperor’s years and fate are extended, and the myriad things are all well-governed."

Someone asks: "Among all things, some fail to be born at the proper time, while others are not nurtured. If they are not raised to maturity, where do their great faults originate?"

The answer: "When things that should be born are not born, it is the fault of Heaven. When things that should be nurtured are not nurtured, it is the fault of Earth. Heaven and Earth are the dwelling place of the myriad things, and the worthy are the artisans of the myriad things. The emperor, who embodies Heaven, constantly desires to give life. The empress, who embodies Earth, constantly desires to nurture. The great ministers, who embody humanity, constantly desire to bring things to completion. When these three work in unison, all things, from birth to their end, remain unharmed. To emulate the Way of equilibrium, those who establish laws must act accordingly."

"May I ask: Does the Way of Heaven assist the weak? The strong? The few? Or the many?" The divine being replied: "The Way of Heaven assists the weak."

"Why is this so?"
"The weak is the function of the Dao; the few is the essence of the Dao. Thus, the North Star stands alone, yet all stars align with it—through the few it governs the many. The essence of the Dao is singular, and the Dao follows it. For this reason, the king is exceedingly few, yet all under Heaven aid him in governance—this is the efficacy of assisting the few. Parents are exceedingly strong, yet they aid the infant—this is the efficacy of the strong assisting the weak. The supremely good are few and weak, while the unvirtuous are strong and numerous; yet the many are but few, and the strong are but weak. Therefore, the noble person seeks weakness, not strength; seeks the few, not the many. Thus, the Way of Heaven protects them. They do not contend with others, yet others contend of their own accord; they do not contend for strength, yet others aid them in becoming strong. Thus, without contending, they excel in victory."

Distinguish between the Way of Heaven’s refinement of the body and the unsevered bond of virtue.

"May I ask: 'When the Dao is properly aligned with joy and desire in action, what is its clear efficacy?'"

The divine being replied: "I received this text from the celestial deities, who declared: 'We have heard that it corresponds with yin and yang, wind and rain, cold and heat—this is its great efficacy. Heaven delights in the Dao’s enactment, yet people do not clearly believe in it, so we manifest efficacy by granting or withholding rain. When the Dao of Great Peace is practiced, all prayers are answered; when the Dao of Great Peace is not practiced, prayers go unanswered. This makes clear that the supreme Dao resides in Great Peace.

Thus, when the myriad things fail to be born, the fault lies in the Great Yang; when they are born but not nurtured, the fault lies in the Great Yin; when they are nurtured but not brought to completion, the fault lies in the harmony of the center. Therefore, that which gives birth is the father; that which nurtures is the mother; that which brings to completion is the child. That which gives birth is the Dao; that which nurtures is virtue; that which brings to completion is benevolence.

If a single thing fails to be born, one Dao is obstructed and impassable; if a single thing is not nurtured, one virtue is left uncultivated; if one virtue is not brought to completion, one act of benevolence is not enacted. To know for oneself whether one possesses the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, observe the things of the world—this will make it self-evident.

These five principles are what emperors, kings, lords, fathers, and teachers must deeply understand to assess the excellence or inferiority of the Dao, virtue, and benevolence. Simply observe this: the foremost good is to delight in giving life; the next good is to delight in nurturing; the next is to delight in bestowing. Thus, that which gives life resembles Heaven; that which nurtures resembles Earth; that which bestows resembles benevolence. These three are the great guiding principles of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Anything beyond this is merely a last resort for times of exhaustion.

When this is so, the qi of Heaven naturally attains peace, perverse qi naturally vanishes, good people naturally arrive, and evil people naturally depart—all respond without fail. The one who clarifies this is the teacher, for the teacher is the title of the one who knows first and should take evidence as their guide to make it clear.

From ancient times to the present, all texts have issued from Heaven and Earth; thus, Heaven and Earth produce them first. The one who clarifies them is the teacher; thus, all texts emerge with a teacher, and the one who enacts them is the ruler. In antiquity, emperors and kings received the Mandate of Heaven, followed the teachings of their teachers, and diligently practiced them to eliminate disasters and calamities, thereby aligning with the will of Heaven and attaining longevity and extended life—this is what it means.

The creator is Heaven; the clarifier is the teacher; the enactor is the emperor or king. These three matters depend on one another to be fulfilled. If Heaven did not produce texts, teachers would have no way to know; if teachers did not clarify texts, emperors and kings would have no way to know how to govern. Thus, when Heaven intends to raise up an emperor or king, it must first produce extraordinary texts. Enlightened teachers then instruct the emperor, king, and officials, enabling them to attain longevity and extended life—this is the clear proof of Heaven’s protection of the emperor or king."

"When the people and the myriad things fail to be born, are born but not nurtured, are nurtured but do not grow, grow but do not reach completion, or do not fulfill their natural lifespan—where does the fault lie?"

"When the people and the myriad things fail to be born, the fault lies with Heaven; when they are born but not nurtured, the fault lies with Earth; when they grow but do not reach completion, the fault lies with humanity."

"Does the fault lie with humanity?"

"When the myriad things fail to be born in due season, the fault lies with the ruler; when they are born but not nurtured, the fault lies with the ministers; when they grow but do not reach completion, the fault lies with the people. Heaven and the ruler-father preside over birth—this is the dominion of the Great Yang, the origin of life. If Heaven does not desire life, things cannot be born; if the father does not desire to bestow, things also cannot be born; if the ruler does not desire life, things also cannot be born. Thus, Heaven and the ruler-father preside over birth.

The ruler-father who constantly contemplates life and does not delight in killing ensures that all things flourish. A single thought of killing results in the death of one thing; ten thoughts of killing result in the death of ten things; a hundred thoughts of killing result in the death of a hundred things—extending to ten thousand thoughts, it is always thus."

"Does the Earth-mother and her ministers, who receive the bestowal of Yang, preside over the nurturing of the myriad things—do they constantly contemplate nurturing?"

"A single thought of failing to nurture harms one thing; ten thoughts harm ten things; a hundred thoughts harm a hundred things—extending to ten thousand, it is always thus. Therefore, the emperors and kings of high antiquity appointed ministers who sought compassion and benevolence, delighting in nurturing the myriad things and governing accordingly. In middle antiquity, they were half compassionate and benevolent, so half of the things were harmed. In later antiquity, they did not carefully select and appoint ministers, so all things were harmed.

The virtue of the August Thearch and the king shines brilliantly. The Thearch acts as wisdom between Heaven and Earth, preventing them from falling into misfortune and calamity—hence the title 'Thearch.' The king is one to whom the people and the myriad things turn without harm—hence the title 'king' (wang), meaning 'to go toward.' The lord ensures that each remains within their proper bounds, and people turn to them without harm—hence the title 'lord' (jun), meaning 'to summon.' The official (li) governs, assisting their superiors in managing things so that all people and things, great and small, do not lose their proper governance—only then is the title 'official' fitting. The teacher (shi) fully comprehends the words of the world and is thus worthy of the title 'great teacher,' for they can interpret all the texts of Heaven and Earth. Thus, they are called 'August Thearch, King, Lord, and Teacher.'

Therefore, the Way of the August One is the head; the Way of the Thearch is the torso; the Way of the king is the thighs; the officials are the hands and feet. The Way of the teacher is the carpenter’s line and ink, the standard and rule, upon which high and low depend to stand. Thus, the good governor constantly contemplates the Way of the August One, secondarily contemplates the Way of the Thearch, and lastly contemplates the Ways of the lord and officials. By constantly reciting the laws of the great teacher, they uphold the carpenter’s line, and only then can the will of Heaven be at peace, the intent of Earth be attained, the four seasons proceed in order, the five phases not contend, the three luminaries remain bright, ghosts, spirits, and refined qi cause no harm, the five officials and five soils each attain their proper place, bandits and thieves do not arise, and the emperor or king governs with ease, all proclaiming 'ten thousand years.'

The Dao of Heaven is the law—without my texts, it is truly difficult! Carefully ponder their meaning and practice these two matters—there are also warnings here!"

The nature of Heaven and Earth is such that refined qi, ghosts, and spirits govern the learning and teaching of humanity. Spirits reside in the yin of the human heart; refined essence resides in the yin of the kidneys; ghosts reside in the yin of the liver.

When a person’s thoughts are upright and good, they teach others to do good; dwelling constantly in the hidden yin of humanity, they incline others toward evil and instruct them in evil, thus also inclining them toward evil. In ancient times, the worthy and the sages harbored hidden thoughts of goodness within, and so received good responses. Ordinary people harbor hidden thoughts of evil within, and so receive evil responses, unable to restrain themselves. The fault lies in the constant hidden thoughts of good and evil—ghosts and spirits accordingly incline toward good or evil, and the presence of ghosts here may be verified.

When the qi of Great Peace prevails, wind and rain come in their seasons, the myriad things grow abundantly, and the earth is well-fertilized, becoming daily more robust and rich, thus enabling long life. In inauspicious years, rain does not come in due time, the myriad things on earth grow sparse and few, short and stunted, unable to fertilize themselves, so the earth becomes daily poorer and barren, incapable of nurturing the myriad things. The movements of Heaven and Earth still require the harmonious union of yin and yang to achieve Great Peace and bring about the officials of the four seasons and five phases.

The monthly establishment of the emperor or king corresponds to the qi of the emperor or king, which expels the officials of evil and wickedness. The qi of establishment and the qi of kingship are the imperial qi of Heaven’s four seasons and five phases. The qi of ministerial influence and removal come before—one is to rectify what lies ahead, the officials who point directly like the tips of hair. What they face are crouching villains, who can no longer act to cause harm. The qi of removal, fulfillment, and pacification are all good and upright officials. The five who hold positions ahead reside in the forefront, preparing the qi of the emperor or king to grasp and expel great evil. The five generals of establishment and the forefront all receive the upright qi of Heaven, all being divine officials of Heaven, who serve as Heaven’s envoys. Without exception, the myriad things of the twelve thousand categories all don the virtue of these officials and follow their transformations.

When the qi of kingship should die, when the monthly establishment should be broken, this is the most revered and majestic qi, and thus it cannot be withstood. When it should die, it is called the great consuming qi of killing. What follows the monthly establishment is closure, which seals off evil and villainy, fearing that the subsequent qi of rest and submission might encroach upon the establishment qi of the emperor or king. Thus Heaven closes what follows, and when it opens again, it drives away the qi of rest and evil. What follows becomes the completion of villainy, and thus it should be reined in. The five that follow are perilous, for their position is near the great executioner of Heaven’s grasp, and with one turn of breaking, they strike—hence the peril. These five generals of the rear are those whom Heaven wishes to rest, aligning with Earth’s qi to preside over the closure and concealment of villainy and evil, where ghosts and spirits dwell together, and thus they must not be employed.

Someone asked: “The north is the beginning of the August One, the east is the beginning of the emperor, the south is the beginning of the king, and the west is the beginning of the hegemon. Now Heaven has the six jia and twelve branches—where should the August Way begin?”

“Indeed, Heaven has three systems, each with great boundlessness. The first is the Heavenly August One, the second is the emperor, the third is the king, and the fourth is the hegemon. The Heavenly August One begins with the first jiazi, the Earthly August One with yichou, the Human August One with bingyin, and the Hegemonic Way with dingmao—these are the reckonings of Heaven’s qi and destiny. As for the Earthly reckoning, the August Way begins with zi, the imperial way with chou, the kingly way with yin, and the hegemonic way with mao. These four all initially receive the subtle qi of Heaven and Earth to bring forth life and must not incur punishment. Those that incur punishment harm the August Way, for the Dao and its laws must not be harmed. Thus, zi punishes mao, chou punishes xu, and yin punishes si—all emanate punitive qi and cannot coexist.”

Someone asked: “Heaven bestows ranks upon people according to degree, Earth bestows ranks upon people according to degree, and people bestow ranks upon people according to degree—may I hear of this?”

“Heaven bestows upon people through the Dao, Earth bestows upon people through nurturing virtue, and people bestow upon people through emoluments and sustenance.”

“Why is this?”

“Heaven, by means of the Dao, is distinct and enduring, thus it bestows the Dao to grant longevity, enabling one to be sated by the qi of wind. Earth presides over nurturing good land. Earth makes people prosperous, thus it bestows upon people virtue and wealth. The ruler bestows upon people emoluments and sustenance, granting them clothing. These three matters are all good. Those who love the Dao without ceasing are thus bestowed by Heaven. Those who love virtue and cherish the earth, knowing how to select and dwell in land, avoiding misfortune and obtaining good fortune, are bestowed by Earth. Those who study diligently and benefit the governance of their superiors cannot be distanced by the ruler or father, for they must be employed in governance—thus they are bestowed by people. In ancient times, the sages and worthies exerted themselves in study and dared not lose these three matters. Thus, some obtained the Dao and departed, some avoided the world and returned to the earth, and some obtained the emoluments and sustenance of the ruler.”

Someone asked: “As for the five tones of music, what is it like to attain their proper sound? What is it like not to attain their proper sound? May I hear of both?”

“The tones are not empty—they are a method to summon true matters, to bring forth the real through the void, to call forth the embodied from the formless. Music, through its sounds, summons events. It is like a person opening their mouth to utter a sound—some are good, some are evil. The good bring forth good fortune, the evil bring forth misfortune. These words all emerge from the mouth, thus summoning responses of good and evil. The proper sounds of music are the language of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and five phases. By listening to their tones, one knows the sentiments of Heaven and Earth, the harmony of the qi of the four seasons and five phases—there is no end to what may be known. Thus, the superior person attains their meaning to govern and measure with balance; the middling person employs them to assist the ruler in governance and attain longevity; the worthy person employs them to attain freedom from care. Tones, through one, ride upon the myriad things, and the myriad things ride upon the boundless—all under Heaven is complete.”

Someone asked: “What is the significance of the *Scripture of Great Peace* having one hundred seventy scrolls?”

“The number one is the beginning of all reckoning. Thus, when Heaven and Earth were not yet divided, accumulated qi formed a single unity. Divided into two, they became husband and wife. Heaven descended upon Earth, conceiving in the profound darkness, and was named jiazi.”

“Roots spread to the northeast, where *chou* marks the beginning of *yin*; appearing in the east, the sun rises at *mao*. Life flourishes in the southeast, where *chen* extends to *si* with branches drooping toward the south, nurtured at *wu*. Turning old in the southwest, it is *wei* leading to *shen*; maturing in the west, the sun sets at *you*. All is stored in the northwest, between *xu* and *hai*. Thus, reckoning begins with one and ends at twelve. The root of the *Ganzhi* stems from the five phases. Therefore, one completes ten, and a hundred makes it complete. Thus, Heaven generates things: in spring, the resonance of a hundred days nears its end. Therefore, the celestial Dipper establishes *chen* and breaks at *xu*. *Jian* means to stand—all things fully arise at *chen*. *Po* means to decay—all things fully perish at *xu*. Thus, reckoning follows Heaven and descends to Earth, encompassing the eight directions, and is complete at ten. Yin and yang establish and break, cycling with seven, returning to their origin. Following the Dipper’s pointer clarifies affairs, for the Dipper has seven stars to illuminate the beginning and end of yin and yang. Thus, the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls models the numbers of Heaven and Earth, aligns with yin and yang as its method, and follows the four seasons and five phases in its practice, not daring to lose even a fraction. To lose it is to abandon Heaven’s affairs, to have no ground, to fail Heaven and Earth’s intent, to disregard celestial reckoning in making scripture—useless for governing the world, unable to model Heaven and Earth’s laws, and powerless to remove harm. To know its efficacy: gather the world’s scattered texts, amass them for thirty *li*, and even if they reach Heaven, they cannot dispel disasters. Beneath the great Heaven, within eighty-one regions and eleven thousand states, each has its own texts, all seeking to eliminate evil and bring goodness, to dispel disasters. Now, if all were collected and assembled in a hundred-*li* square, piled to Heaven’s height, they still could not dispel disasters. Though this text is few, if the emperor and kings practice it, they will surely await its clear efficacy.

In high antiquity, the first were the divine persons, the second the perfected persons, the third the immortals, and the fourth the Daoists—all modeled Heaven to grasp the true meaning of the Dao. Dazzling the eyes with inward vision, they ordered within with the heart, turning yin’s brightness to penetrate the great yang, inwardly attaining the Dao’s essentials alone. Like fire making light shine within but not without, they preserved constancy without confusion. Those who now study transcendence model the ancients in turning inward—this is what it means. Over time, transmission begets decline, and daily they grow weary of their practice, losing the Dao’s meaning, unable to illuminate within, and daily governance worsens. Thus, Heaven sends forth sages, modeling celestial patterns to order the world, for celestial patterns are self-evident. When celestial patterns are correct, Heaven is correct; when earthly patterns are correct, Earth is correct; when human patterns are correct, humans are correct. When Heaven, Earth, and humans are all correct, the myriad things are all correct. Humans are the foremost of the myriad things. If humans lose their proper role and suffer harm, dying before their time, the myriad things follow, and Heaven and Earth do likewise. Pernicious qi surges, and people fall ill, not living out their Heaven-appointed years. Only the practices of past and present each have their proper sequence, not transgressing one another.”

The Most Revered Divine Beings of the Supreme August One, who name themselves the Lords of Entrusted Qi, also called the Great Spirits, ever abide at the left side of the Celestial Sovereign. They preside over the compilation of the texts of the Hall of Luminous Patterns, ensuring distinctions are made and great duties are meticulously discharged. Their role is to enable rulers to commune with the immortals, recording the names of those yet unborn, each with their designated years, months, days, and hours. When the time for ascension arrives, spirits are dispatched to transform their bodies under the guidance of masters, allowing them to ascend. Each bears a name, with years, months, days, and hours assigned; when the appointed time for ascension comes, spirits are sent to transform their bodies under the masters’ guidance, enabling their ascent.

According to their wisdom and capacity, each is assigned roles without forgetfulness, with clear distinctions so all may know their own abilities. Only then are they entrusted with duties. Upon submission, it is declared: “The Great Spirits, as overseers of the celestial host, each govern their own domains. They must serve with clarity, leaving no room for doubt. Let their lifespans be long and their records precise; this must be carefully observed. Those of sagely illumination and intent should be granted all that lives beneath the sun.”

Again, through ledgers, tallies, and calculations, their accounts are made clear, to be kept in the Bureau of Accounts, which oversees the quantities of treasure and valuables. All those who must submit accounts must first notify the Bureau of Accounts, and together with its officials, they shall present them to the Minister of Agriculture. On the thirtieth day of long months and the twenty-ninth of short months, they shall assemble before the Great Spirits of the Hall of Luminous Patterns, never missing the appointed time, as commanded by the Celestial Sovereign. None may fail to arrive within the first three *ke* of dawn. The Great Spirits of the Hall of Luminous Patterns shall submit their reports at the fifth *ke*, following the Celestial Sovereign’s established decrees.

The Great Spirits, receiving the Sovereign’s mandate, instruct the Minister of Agriculture, who in turn commands the subordinate prefectures and kingdoms. They report on the domains they oversee, submitting ledgers of all goods delivered to the Minister of Agriculture. Should any be remiss in timely submission, the Minister shall report to the Great Spirits of the Hall of Luminous Patterns, who will inform the Celestial Sovereign. A decree shall then be issued to the Minister, ordering the prefectures and kingdoms to hasten compliance, ensuring no delay beyond the prescribed deadline. Time, days, and *ke* are assigned with distinctions, allowing no disorder; all must follow a unified system, with duplicate records kept. In Heaven, there are no disasters of flood or drought, and no alterations may be made to the records. When the Wheel of Fate turns, no delays or pretexts are permitted, lest one be suspected of embezzlement. Those who become aware must report it; Heaven is ever watchful, and offenses are never pardoned. Let each be vigilant in their duties and clear in their affairs.

The Celestial Sovereign foreknows all yet does not speak aloud; one must carefully consider what is asked, for such words are not to be used. Floods and droughts are without constancy, disasters and calamities arise together, people fall ill and die in countless numbers—all due to the failure to follow the Celestial Sovereign’s decrees. When the Celestial Sovereign issues commands to the Great Spirits, the high ministers, officials of the two-thousand-bushel rank, and all divine functionaries must devote themselves to loyalty and action, striving to fulfill the Celestial Sovereign’s will.

The Celestial Sovereign, together with the masters of transformation, shall verify those worthy of ascension and rectification. Each shall attain the radiance of spirit, their brilliance corresponding to their rank and the spirits they have transformed, all arranged in proper order with their respective offices and subordinates. The Celestial Sovereign commands the Great Spirits to perpetually refine and perfect them. Let each measure their own capacity, their aspirations growing daily, yearning for ascension. As they transform, their luminous essence becomes visible at midday, their true spirits penetrating and clear, drifting and roaming beyond the eight bounds. They observe Heaven’s works, discerning its movements, each following what is fitting.

Audiences with Heaven occur on fixed days. At the establishment of the new moon, the Great and Lesser Spirits arrange themselves in order, their ranks determined by precedence. Court assemblies with high ministers do not extend beyond the morning audience. Each spirit clarifies their domain, conducting inspections without fixed schedule, ensuring the clarity of documents and holding accountable those with duties. They must first address their tasks in accordance with the Celestial Sovereign’s decrees. Should they have matters to report, they must open the Hall of Luminous Patterns to speak. Each must demonstrate their clarity and bear their responsibilities, never lacking in merit.

The Celestial Sovereign commands the Great Spirits to assemble the host of officials, each rectifying their demeanor, ensuring no transgressions. They are to be assessed by law and examine their domains. Heaven is ever aware, and their faults will not be absolved. Let each be vigilant in their duties, lest they be found wanting by the spirits.

The Celestial Sovereign further commands the Great Spirits: “Within the prefectures and kingdoms, those of sagely wisdom and aspiration, who constantly yearn for the arts of longevity and wish to walk the path of the divine with Heaven, desiring to bestow kindness upon others, contemplating generation and transformation, aiding Heaven in governing life and Earth in nurturing form—let them aspire to benevolent transformation. Their names shall be submitted to the Great Spirits, with records kept in the bureaus, their merits frequently reported, and their trustworthiness verified. The bureaus shall present their intentions; the Celestial Sovereign shall determine their number, and the spirits who recommend them shall vouch for them. In selecting from the prefectures and kingdoms, only the most excellent shall be chosen.”

The Celestial Sovereign commands the Hall of Luminous Patterns: “All who serve the Celestial Sovereign in governing the myriad duties must cultivate impartiality. Each shall act in accordance with their celestial domains, ensuring proper division of labor. Let all be utterly loyal and sincere, communicating what they know, striving to accomplish their tasks and govern their affairs. Let their reputations be steadfast and far-reaching; they should advance their thoughts, and where their voices reach, though their intentions may be unspoken, the Celestial Sovereign already hears their words. How can any concealment or lack of loyalty exist?”

Someone asked: “Now, wishing to further clarify the laws of sagely and benevolent worthies and utterly eradicate heterodox texts, how can this be made even clearer?”

The reply: “Heaven is afflicted by these false and deceptive texts and commands their removal, to adopt the luminous Dao of Heaven. The texts of the sages of past and present are what govern Heaven and Earth. When the texts of the sages are clear, the Dao of Heaven is greatly ordered. What the August Heaven detests and finds displeasing gives rise to warfare, unending floods and droughts, and ceaseless disasters. Kings are distressed, all saying that the texts of the sages have gradually fallen into disorder and obscurity, hence the Dao of Heaven is clouded and difficult to govern. When the texts of the sages are disordered, the Dao of Heaven is likewise disordered; when the texts of the sages are abandoned and unused, the Dao of Heaven is likewise abandoned and unused.”

The question: “In ancient times, there were no texts, yet the Dao of Heaven was not disordered. At that time, the celestial decrees had not yet emerged. The Supreme Sovereign and divine beings governed the ancestral spirits, originally sharing the same body as August Heaven. Over time, they drifted far from the Dao of Heaven, descending into chaos and turmoil, no longer understanding the will of Heaven. Thus, Heaven issued the decrees, commanding the sages to record and transmit them. Yet the sages did not remain long in the world, so they inscribed and deposited them to bequeath to later generations. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, the Dao of Heaven will be properly ordered.”

The question: “Now, if one wishes to govern the affairs of qi and attain longevity, may I hear of this?”

The reply: “Indeed. Attend carefully to my words. August Heaven has its constant laws. For those who rule as lords above, they must emulate Heaven in their conduct, employing the Dao, virtue, and benevolence as the three guiding principles. If the lord above delights in desirelessness and tranquility, he should contemplate the Dao in the morning, virtue at midday, and benevolence in the evening—thus, no affairs will trouble him.”

The question: “I wish to hear why one contemplates the Dao in the morning, virtue at midday, and benevolence in the evening.”

The reply: “Indeed. The Dao of Heaven may be followed but not opposed. Those who follow Heaven prosper; those who oppose it perish.”

The question: “Now, I wish to hear the essential meaning of this.”

The reply: “Indeed. Heaven has four seasons and three divisions. Morning governs generation, midday governs nurturance, and evening governs bestowal. Thus, the southeast generates, the southwest nurtures, and the northwest bestows. Therefore, humans emulate Heaven in their conduct: in the southeast, they plant and generate; in the southwest, they nurture and cultivate; from mid-autumn onward, within the summer domain, they dwell, marry, and propagate their kind—this is the natural teaching of August Heaven. Thus, the people silently follow it. Those who can constantly emulate this align with the will of Heaven; those who cannot are said to oppose Heaven’s teachings and thus suffer many harms. Minor harm injures the spring’s beings, harm to the robust injures the summer’s beings, harm to the elderly injures the autumn’s beings, and harm to the pregnant injures the winter’s beings—this is the natural law. The sage-kings of old constantly reflected on the Dao of Heaven in their actions, never daring to deviate even slightly.”

"Someone asked, 'Is it possible to hear how one may attain enduring abundance from the earth?'

The answer: 'Those who constantly follow what Heaven does will long share in Heaven’s abundance; those who lightly oppose it will long incur Heaven’s resentment. Thus, the governance of the ancient sage-kings consisted of three principles: first, constant generation; second, constant nurturance; third, constant bestowal. Acting in this manner, they carefully upheld the Dao of Heaven, avoiding the reputation of disorder. Fourth is punishment without order, and fifth is killing—these are the extremes. By this distinction, the first-rank ruler purely generates, the second-rank purely nurtures, the third-rank purely bestows, the fourth-rank purely punishes, and the fifth-rank purely kills. The generating ruler extends years and prospers the state; the nurturing ruler increases longevity; the bestowing ruler commits no transgressions; the punishing ruler invites illness; the killing ruler meets with violent ruin.

The ancient sage-kings observed Heaven’s clear prohibitions and dared not act recklessly. On days when the six *jia* cyclical signs governed the kingly *qi* and subtle influences, they neither raged nor spoke of ill matters. On such days, they spoke only of good things, feasted, and made music to avert disasters and dispel inauspicious *qi*. Thus, the kingly *qi* was always shown reverence. Therefore, the people of the ancient era who measured their lives by this, and the governance of the sage-kings who followed it, could lie down in peace and reflection, completing their days without a single disturbance. In spring, they slept with heads to the east; in summer, to the south; in autumn, to the west; in winter, to the north; and during the four seasons, toward their respective corners.

When rulers, ministers, and people all knew this method, the world’s perverse *qi* was entirely dispelled. According to the celestial model, on kingly days, weapons were taken from the armories and buried in the earth. On days of rest and cessation, they were returned, so banditry did not arise, and warfare ceased.'

Someone asked, 'Does Heaven alone grow angry and fail to respond in harmony with humans—can this be known?'

The answer: 'Indeed, Heaven’s principle uses *qi* as its language, manifesting in the four seasons. If the *qi* of the *jue* (wood) angle is unrecognized, the liver’s pulse does not move, the *jue* and *cu* (cluster) notes are disharmonious, and the clear tones do not resonate, this is Heaven’s displeasure and silence. The ancient sage-kings, upon seeing this, would reflect on the principles of gain and loss to correct it. Where the kingly *qi* resides, benevolence aids its governance. These two *qi* together generate and complete things there. When the *qi* of rest, cessation, and misfortune reverses and arrives to assist governance, this becomes the third *qi*. The *qi* of petty people appears in this way, lacking alignment with Heaven’s position, thus resembling petty people.

When Heaven observes and sees its kind, it commands the worthy and sagely to devise strategies and reflect, seeking reclusive Daoists, virtuous people, and benevolent people to reverse and restore its *qi*, establishing correspondence. Thus, the king who governs the Dao of Heaven uses the people and ministers as his limbs; if his governance is poor, he disorders the Dao. The ancient sages, when governing the Dao of Heaven, sought those of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and wisdom to govern together, thereby dwelling in peace. Thus, the Daoist belongs to Heaven, the virtuous person to Earth, and the benevolent person to the center of harmony. If the three norms are disharmonious, the three worthies govern them. When the *qi* of Great Peace arrives, all things are ordered.'"

"Someone asked, 'How can all the people become fully benevolent?'

The reply: 'The Dao of Heaven gives birth to virtue, and virtue gives birth to benevolence. Now, if the ruler takes a Daoist as his teacher and models himself on the Dao, then his ministers will embody virtue. The people, in turn, model themselves on the ministers; if the ministers are virtuous, the people become benevolent. Commands flow downward, imitating those above, and those above model themselves on Heaven. Thus, in mutual generation, how could the people fail to become fully benevolent? The ancient sage-kings took great Daoists as their teachers precisely to transform those below. The highest ruler governs like Heaven, the middling ruler like Earth, and the lowest ruler like man. To govern like Heaven is to never lose Heaven’s intent, serving the Great Dao as a father. To govern like Earth is to never lose Earth’s intent, serving Earth’s Dao as a mother. To govern like man is to never lose human intent, seeking joy in attaining the Dao of central harmony.

The sage, seeing all things born, knows their principle reveres the Dao; seeing all things nurtured, knows their true virtue; seeing all things completed, knows their true benevolence. Those who order the true Dao have only the mind of generation; those who order true virtue have only the mind of nurturance; those who order benevolence have only the mind of bestowal. Without these three norms—Dao, virtue, and benevolence—one cannot be called a ruler of Great Peace.

The celestial scholar is born of Heaven, receiving its entrusted *qi* in formless generation. How could one who knows the celestial scholar fail to know, fail to understand, fail to see? They are the primordial *qi*, sharing office and acting in unison. The celestial scholar dwells always in the Palace of the Boundless, managing documents in harmony with Heaven. Above and below, none lose their duty, thus knowing what may be born; descending into earthly forms, they enable completion, and all things receive glory. The celestial scholar is revered by Heaven, looked up to by all spirits—like the crown prince of the Emperor, who would dare show disrespect?

The Heavenly Lord is entrusted with *qi*, hence named the Heavenly Lord, supreme without peer. What command or teaching of his would not be obeyed?'

Someone asked, 'When the ruler of Great Peace’s Dao flourishes, his virtue is next to Heaven’s. If he obtains the scripture and practices it alone, his transformative influence will flow throughout the world, and there will be nothing not at peace. The greatest spirits are none other than Heaven and Earth; the greatest luminaries are none other than the sun and moon—yet even they, each contributing half their power, together complete the whole. Heaven and Earth each exert half their strength, uniting in heart and desire to harmonize, and thus bring forth the myriad things. Day and night each contribute half their power to complete a single day. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each exert half their strength to complete a year. The moon begins to wax in the west, grows toward the east, and by the fifteenth day is called yang; after the fifteenth, it wanes and is called yin. Each contributes half its power to complete a month. Man and woman each contribute half their strength, uniting in shared purpose to complete a household. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is one yin and one yang, each contributing half their power to become one, and only then do they together complete the whole. Thus, when ruler and minister unite in heart and strength, each contributing half their power, thinking alike in their modest efforts, they achieve the governance of Great Peace.'

Someone asked, 'Though the writings of people today are many, and they claim all things are complete, disasters, harms, bandits, and thieves are ever in excess. They are constantly beset by sorrow and suffering, and on inauspicious days, officials and people join to rescue them, yet cannot. What has been cut off revives again. Now, I can long supplement their deficiencies and ensure no further calamities. Since the emergence of the Heavenly Contract, among all the writings of sages and worthies, are there any that are the same? All differ. Thus, when Heaven commands a master to emerge, to eliminate inauspicious virtue, shelter the people and ministers, and extend radiance to the four directions, distant and near respond in echo, and grace reaches even the grasses and trees. This is the opening of their intent, and their writings all differ.'

Someone asked, 'The essential Dao of past and present all speaks of guarding the One, which can ensure long life without aging. To know how to guard the One is called the Dao of the Boundless. A person has one body, which should always unite with essence and spirit. The form is the master of death; essence and spirit are the masters of life. Constant union brings good fortune; separation brings misfortune. Without essence and spirit, there is death; with them, there is life. Constant union is called the One, which can ensure long life. The constant fear is that essence and spirit will scatter, not gathering within the body but instead following human thoughts to wander. Thus, the sage teaches guarding the One, meaning one should guard one’s body. If thoughts do not cease, essence and spirit will naturally come, and nothing will fail to respond; the hundred illnesses will be eliminated, and this is the tally of long life and enduring vision.

The yang guards the One; the yin guards the Two, hence called "killing." Thus, in daylight, which is yang, the human soul constantly dwells united; in darkness, which is yin, soul and spirit contend in action as dreams, thoughts lose their form, and they divide into two, leading to death. Essence and spirit are entirely lost, and only the form remains. Guarding the One is truly uniting the real as one. The essence and spirit of human life are all fully possessed; if one guards them without scattering, one can transcend the world, become a good parent to the people, meet the ruler of Great Peace, and be beloved by spirits and numina.'

The *Three Caverns Pearl Satchel*, Scroll Four, *On Abstaining from Grain*, citing the *Classic of Great Peace* 145, asks, 'How do those of the upper, middle, and lower ranks who attain the Dao and transcend the world sustain themselves?'

The reply: 'The highest first rank eats wind and *qi*; the second rank eats medicinal flavors; the third rank eats sparingly, just enough to keep the intestines and stomach clear. It also says: "Heaven is distant and boundless; without eating wind and *qi*, how could one move swiftly and circulate through Heaven’s Dao? One must also communicate merit with the spirit officials, forming a fellowship, hence eating wind and *qi*. The next rank should join forces with Earth’s essence, harmonizing the five soils, traversing high and low mountains and rivers, entering water along the mountains, communicating with Earth in turn, sharing merit in eating—thus, they cannot eat grain and instead drink water as they travel."'"

The next stage of Dao attainment is through regulated fasting, though the form remains unconsolidated—this merely distinguishes the practitioner from ordinary people. Thus, eating sparingly to clear the intestines also characterizes those who achieve the Dao.

1. *Shen dao shu* (Book of the Divine Dao)
2. *He shi wen* (Text of Verified Matters)
3. *Qu fu hua ji* (Record of Discarding Ornamentation)
〈End〉
Collectively termed *Da shun zhi dao* (The Dao of Great Compliance).

*Tai* means great; great means Heaven. Heaven covers and nurtures the myriad things—its merit is supreme. *Ping* means Earth; Earth is level, yet it nourishes the myriad things. *Jing* means constancy. Heaven takes the sun, moon, and five planets as its warp; Earth takes its mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams as its warp. When Heaven and Earth lose their constant Dao, the myriad things all suffer calamity. The emperor and king model themselves above on August Heaven, below on Empress Earth, and in the center on the warp and weft of stars, mountains, and rivers, nurturing the myriad things. Thus, it is called *Da shun zhi dao* (The Dao of Great Compliance).

Divine persons, perfected persons, sages, and worthies each determine for themselves whether a method is right or wrong. In ancient times, divine persons discerned right and wrong, success and failure—their affairs were immediately observable. Not only were they not obscure, but they were luminously clear. The divine Dao is most abundant; when one cultivates and habituates the spirits of the body, rectifies the heart-mind, nothing remains hidden. Good emerges, evil is suppressed, and one knows the methods of fortune and misfortune as if gazing into a mirror. At such times, the worthy and enlightened find peace; opportunities do not return, and things do not respond twice. Thus, one attains singular flourishing, harmonizing distant regions, and affairs manifest as they should. When responses appear, take care not to resist or oppose; gather them as treasured vessels—this may be called attaining the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth. The time is ripe, affairs are in order, the divine Dao arrives, the worthy deliberate, the auspicious come, the perverse do not approach, clarity and brightness appear, the four directions rejoice, recluses and hidden scholars emerge, the heart of Heaven is attained, the arts of governance are obtained, perversity does not arise, natural penetration is achieved, perfected persons come to assist, the world responds with goodness, each comes with their proper affairs, and confusion and disorder depart.

This response arises from the abdomen, issues from the heart-mind, and is as swift in verification as thunder and lightning.

〈Beginning〉
Now, auspicious responses arise from within the breast, following thoughts as they come and go. In an instant, they circulate throughout the world. The heart’s desires move August Heaven; yin and yang shift in response. Sincere speech moves Heaven—this is the principle.
〈End〉

[Appendix]
*Dao dian lun*, Scroll 4, *Miao rui pian* (Chapter on Wondrous Auspices), citing the *Tai ping jing*:
When the ruler acts with goodness within, wind and rain arrive on time without—thus, auspicious responses arise from within the human breast. Therefore, whatever one desires to do is met with auspicious responses; how could they not come? Sincerity alone moves August Heaven; yin and yang shift in response—who goes forth to move them?

The body and form cannot go forth to move them. That which moves lies hidden within the heart-mind; sincerity moves Heaven.

Thoughts can bring forth rectitude or perversity—all arise from the will. They can move Heaven and Earth, harmonize yin and yang, unite the myriad things, enter to refine the body, and emerge to establish a name. Worthiness and unworthiness all arise from this. Thus, the worthy govern with skill, losing nothing in ten thousand cases.

When there is fault within the abdomen, why does the face flush red?
The heart is the ruler of the five viscera; the ruler is the sovereign. The sovereign upholds rectitude and reports faults to Heaven.

When startled, why does the face turn green?
The liver governs the person; the person is care. Reversing the liver and gallbladder induces anger, hence the color rises as green.

All spirits have their governing principles, responding to the myriad things. Thus, one must always be cautious and good, complying with Heaven and Earth, so that calamities cannot arise again.

External learning is abundant, internal learning scarce; external affairs flourish daily, while internal affairs decline. Thus, people are often ill, and ornamentation proliferates. *Fu* means surface; *hua* means branch. The Dao of Heaven is distant, entering the midst of perversity—one cannot return on their own.

〈Beginning〉
*Shen dao shu* (Book of the Divine Dao): Concentrating essence without deviation, firmly guarding the root, uniting with yin and yang, and aligning with the divine luminaries.
*He shi wen* (Text of Verified Matters): Examining and verifying differences, doubts, and errors without fail.
*Qu fu hua ji* (Record of Discarding Ornamentation): Having strayed far from the root, dwelling in the wild, its texts are disordered and cannot be used regularly—only occasionally recorded.
〈End〉

Those who guard the root govern as if divine; those who guard the center are slightly disordered and troubled; those who guard the branch are benighted. Thus, the worthy guard the root and caution against the center, never daring to follow the branch. If one can guard this without ceasing, goodness will come from all directions. Without resistance or opposition, gather it as a treasured vessel—it will not change for ten thousand generations.

Can human effort in self-cultivation be obstructed? Can perverse and deviant barbarians be repelled? Can weapons and warfare cease? Can staffs and ropes fall silent? Can the four directions be at peace? Can roads be open? Can the ruler be enlightened?

Divine Strategy:
When great persons guard it, the four directions move; when middling scholars practice it, their ministers and subjects become good; when petty persons practice it, they do not harm one another. Its words are concise, its methods clear—how can one not act upon this divine text? If one cannot uphold it, take care not to harm or restrain with cunning.

Methods to Defend Against and Repel Inauspiciousness:
Follow the four seasons and five phases, rectify thoughts within and without, disperse perversity from the body, and repel inauspiciousness. Contemplate and guard the celestial patterns, act in accord with the qi of the four seasons, harmonize yin and yang, and govern ghosts and spirits with a net of administration, preventing them from wantonly harming people.

After the Beginning of Winter until the Beginning of Spring, vigorously employ the qi of Great Yin, and subtly employ the qi of Lesser Yang. Constantly observe one’s intentions: which illnesses are caused by spirits and officials? Their divine officials wear black garments. Contemplate this in seclusion for forty-five days, up to ninety days, and it will make one’s ears and eyes keen.

At the Beginning of Spring, the supreme virtue resides in benevolence, and the qi governs Lesser Yang. The royal qi shifts to the east, activating the Wood phase. Its qi is weak yet benevolent, and its divine officials wear blue-green garments. Contemplate this in seclusion for forty-five days, up to ninety days, and it will dissolve illness. By continuously practicing this without cease, one will daily embody benevolence and love.

Before the Spring Equinox, vigorously employ the qi of Lesser Yang and subtly employ the qi of Greater Yang to assist Lesser Yang. Observe one’s intentions without doubt, deeply contemplate them, and the hundred perversities will submit.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, the supreme virtue is Fire, and the royal qi shifts to the south. The qi of Greater Yang governs with centered harmony. When its divine officials are employed with proper intent, sweetness arises in the mouth, and the red-clad divine officials guard it, driving the hundred ghosts a thousand miles away.

On the Summer Solstice, the supreme virtue is the qi of Greater Yang, the qi of centered harmony. Contemplating its divine officials can cure the hundred illnesses.

In the sixth month of late summer, the supreme virtue governs in harmony, and the royal qi shifts to the southwest, returning to the central palace. Its divine officials wear yellow garments; contemplating them makes sweetness arise in the mouth. Each season’s end should be contemplated for eighteen days.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the supreme virtue resides in Metal. The royal qi shifts to the west, severing and completing the myriad things. Its divine officials wear white garments. Contemplate them for forty-five to ninety days to dispel illness. When one grasps their intent, the bones strengthen and old age brings longevity.

On the Autumn Equinox, the qi of Lesser Yin prevails, subtly employing the qi of Greater Yin. Reverse illnesses by aligning with it.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, the supreme virtue resides in Water, and the royal qi shifts to the north. Its divine officials wear black garments. It sharpens the will and sharpens the ears. Guarding it for forty-five to ninety days dispels the hundred illnesses.

These are the qi of the five phases and four seasons. Internally, they govern the body; externally, they govern perversity. Thus, Heaven employs them for clarity, Earth for tranquility; Heaven employs them for generation, Earth for storage. Humans employ them for flourishing. Those who align with the seasonal qi are called loyal ministers and filial children. This is the great Dao of harmonizing Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the four seasons, and the five phases. Thus, the Dao emerges for the benevolent and worthy, not for the foolish.

**Method for Preserving Life and Repelling Disasters**
At ten years, the spirit endures for twenty years.
At twenty years, the spirit endures for forty years.
At thirty years, the spirit endures for sixty years.
At forty years, the spirit endures for eighty years.
At fifty years, the spirit endures for a hundred years.
At sixty years, the spirit endures for a hundred and twenty years.
At seventy years, the spirit endures for a hundred years.
From eighty to a hundred and twenty, the spirit is exhausted.

In youth, the spirit flourishes; in old age, the spirit wanes. This refers to the essence-spirit of the five viscera, the internal signs. One thousand two hundred and twenty good spirits serve as its envoys, advancing and retreating to observe and await, while ten thousand spirits act as its people, all following the rise and fall of the person. This is the constant principle of Heaven and Earth. If one treats the spirit as a city and skillfully governs it, calming the body and preserving the spirit, illness will not afflict them, and their years will be long. The numinous will protect them.

Thus, Heaven and Earth establish the body with stillness, guard it with the spirit, and enliven it with the Dao. Therefore, if one can remain pure and still, embrace the essence-spirit, and not lose their thoughts and considerations, then inauspicious perversities cannot enter. The true spirit resides within, making one perpetually joyful, content, and disinclined toward greed for wealth and treasure, litigation, or competition for fame and merit. Over time, one will naturally perceive the spirit. The spirit is two feet and five inches tall, and its attire follows the five phases and five viscera.

When the ruler is benevolent, the Dao flourishes; when the ruler is gentle, virtue arises. If the heart harbors even a slight perverse intent, distant regions will fall into chaos. The spirit-qi circulates swifter than thunder and lightning. Swiftly return to the numinous brightness to illuminate the self within, and illness will naturally heal while the person governs themselves.

Thus, the upper limit of human longevity is a hundred and twenty years, the middle is eighty, and the lower is sixty. Beyond this is premature death, for the spirit wanders outside while illness attacks within. Contemplating the root and rectifying conduct makes people cherish one another. The ancients who sought longevity did not lose the Dao.

Heaven and Earth have constant movements; one cannot depart from the root. Therefore, those who seek peace and long life must not forget this foundational Dao. Thus, illustrations are drawn to instruct later generations. They depict the time when people receive life and destiny, from ancient times to the present, without losing the transmission of yin and yang or the succession of types. They generate one another and endure for myriad generations without end.

In decline and flourishing, high and low are balanced. When flourishing, one becomes a ruler; when declining, one becomes a commoner. When flourishing, one attains the Dao; when declining, one suffers punishment.

Of filial piety, nothing is greater than preserving one’s form, for it is the continuation of one’s ancestors. To propagate one’s name to later generations is called a good person who carefully guides the people. Heaven and Earth cherish them, the five phases aid them, the four seasons benefit them, the hundred kings employ them, the myriad people love them, ghosts and spirits protect them, and the spirits of the five viscera abide with them. To encounter this once is to gain life, yet now it is being lost. To depart from this numinous vessel is to return to ashes and dust, to transform without constancy, and to become the myriad things again.

**Method for Distinguishing Forms and Dissolving Perversity to Purify the Body**
The Dao’s generation of humans is fundamentally essence-qi, and all possess spirit. The temporary form is called a person, but fools do not know how to return and preserve their spirit-qi, thus losing the Dao. Those who can return and restore their spirit-qi will complete their natural lifespan, or even double it, for they are of superior talent.

For those seeking to transcend calamity, the method is as follows: Construct a fasting chamber, secure its doors and windows so that no one may enter recklessly. Go there daily to practice; if not refined or at ease, leave again and do not force it. Repeat this until gradually refined and at ease. Once at ease, one will no longer wish to leave, nor speak, nor see food and drink, nor hear human voices.

Accumulate goodness through focused refinement. Close the eyes and inwardly observe the form and appearance, as if residing in a mirror or gazing at the reflection in clear water—this is a minor accomplishment. Without whips or rods, there is strictness; without weapons or staffs, there is authority. All affairs govern themselves.

Is this not wondrous? It is called the path of entering the numinous.

To guard three is not as good as guarding two; to guard two is not as good as guarding one. Ponder this deeply, and the profound mysteries of the Dao are attained.

**Methods for Communing with the Numinous and Transcending Worldly Calamities**
Heaven endows humans with all things complete. Thus, after ten months of gestation, they are born and share the same beginning and end as all things. Therefore, one may transcend calamities and attain great peace.

The superior scholar studies the Dao to assist the emperor and king, ever accumulating merit to ensure enduring longevity. The middling scholar studies the Dao to deliver their household. The inferior scholar studies the Dao merely to free their own body.

The Dao emerges for the wise and enlightened, not for the foolish. Those who can employ it attain fortune; those who cannot—would it not bring harm or ruin?

**The Self-Knowing Methods of the Worthy and the Unworthy**
The superior scholar, of lofty worthiness, is revered in all matters, great and small. The middling scholar is half-revered, while the inferior scholar is not revered at all.

The reason the superior scholar is revered lies in turning inward to the self, not seeking from others. With an open heart and unobstructed intent, they know the root of primordial qi and the natural order. They honor Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the arrayed stars, the Five Phases and Four Seasons, the Six Jia and yin-yang, and all creatures that creep and move—none of these exist in vain. Within the six directions, spirits, demons, and spectral beings, as well as the inner and outer workings of wind, clouds, thunder, and lightning, do not act without purpose. All possess their own numinous powers and rulers, much like humans have their own signs. Thus, they are revered, and none dare act recklessly.

The middling scholar, half-reverent, does not fully grasp the arts of primordial qi and the natural order but only perceives the wind, rain, clouds, and living things. They sometimes claim Heaven has no spirits and do not revere the arrayed stars, sun, or moon, knowing only the Great Fire and the Northern Dipper. The inferior scholar, however, does not comprehend the vastness of mountains and rivers, knowing only how to till the fields, cultivate what they possess, and manage their household and kin. They do not understand how to align with the Four Seasons and Five Phases but merely follow the seasons to plant and harvest for profit. They do not recognize the Six Jia and yin-yang as spiritual forces, dismissing them as nonexistent.

Through diligent study, the foolish become worthy; the worthy, if they do not cease, become sages; the sages, if they persist, become perfected in the Dao; those perfected in the Dao, if they continue, become immortals; the immortals, if they advance further, become true beings; and the true beings, if they do not stop, become divine. All this is achieved through unceasing accumulation of study.

**Methods for Prolonging Life and Honoring the Superior**
First, prolonging life. The barbarians submit to myriad methods, their kinds differing, yet all attain long life. Heaven and Earth cherish them, and their bodies remain free of fault. The reason lies in what is called the path of great compliance. When the Dao is perfected throughout one’s life, one shares the same realm as Heaven and Earth. Those who practiced this in ancient times attained the favor of the myriad spirits. To witness its efficacy, auspicious signs naturally arrive, and misfortunes naturally recede. When emperors and kings govern by it, they need not exert force, and the barbarians submit of their own accord. Practicing it without cease, one becomes a perfected person.

Thus, the teachings of the sages do not require coercion or force to succeed but are established according to natural disposition. The reason emperors and kings can pacify the world is by aligning with the hearts of the people, thereby winning their allegiance.

This Dao was cultivated in ancient texts. When humans are born, they are called *shen* (spirit). They share with Heaven and Earth the division of authority, form, spirit, essence, qi, affairs, karma, and dwelling—thus forming three realms. One qi becomes Heaven, one qi becomes Earth, and one qi becomes humanity; the remaining qi disperses to complete the myriad things. Therefore, Heaven is honored, Earth is revered, and humanity is valued.

Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors all established teachers, and those with doubts knelt to inquire. Therefore, the state remained ordered, and even calamities could be healed.

**The King’s Path to Freedom from Worry**
The path of great compliance ensures that the king has no worries or troubles and attains great peace. If Heaven and Earth do not greatly convulse, if wind and rain do not rage, if the hundred spirits remain in their abodes, then the world is free of disaster. When all things dwell in their proper places, joy and freedom from worry follow.

How is this achieved? Benevolence ensures the emperor and king are ever joyful, and the Dao ensures they are free from sorrow. If the emperor and king are sorrowful, the world is not at peace.

The emperor and king are the heart of the world; the ministers are the limbs; the common people are the hands and feet. When the heart is sorrowful, the limbs act recklessly, the hands and feet move without rest, and the people drift and scatter. This is their natural mutual influence, and Heaven operates likewise. When Heaven loses the Dao, the clouds and qi become chaotic; when Earth loses the Dao, it cannot contain. The king is in communion with Heaven.

The son delights in his father, the minister delights in his ruler, Earth delights in Heaven, and Heaven delights in the Dao. Thus, the qi of great peace may be attained. When Heaven’s qi is once again ordered, the Supreme August One brings peace below. When Heaven and Earth harmonize, the emperor and king practice our Dao—what fault could there be?

The Dao is the heart of Heaven, the head of Heaven. Once the heart and head act, how could the limbs and body not follow?

**Methods for Returning the Spirit and Dispelling Malevolence**
Distinguish the strengths of the three qi and return the spirit to guard the body.

The qi of Great Yang is Heaven, hence called *shen* (spirit). Form is governed by Great Yin, which nurtures the myriad things, hence the spirit and essence are stored in the abdomen, and Earth’s spirit is called *qi* (earth spirit). Essence is the harmonious essence of the myriad things, thus it advances and retreats without constancy. The essence of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, together generate the myriad things—this is the sequence of the Three Powers.

Spirit governs life, essence governs nurturance, and form governs completion. These three together constitute the vessel of the spirit. They correspond to ruler, minister, and people, and thus cannot be without one another.

When the heart’s spirit stirs, causing the form to become unsettled, preserve it without ceasing. If it is beneficial to remain at peace, it stays; if not, it departs. Initially, employ what is beneficial, teach it to abide in peace, and over time, it will naturally remain without leaving.

Yin qi and yang qi alternately grind and polish one another, thereby generating. Human qi likewise circulates throughout the body, and spirit and essence ride it in their comings and goings.

The spirit and essence depend on qi as fish depend on water—when qi is cut off, spirit and essence scatter; when water is cut off, fish perish. Thus, the Dao of nurturing life begins with calming the body and cultivating qi, avoiding frequent anger or joy. In ancient times, enlightened masters taught emperors and kings to calm their bodies, freeing them from worry, so that they might govern with undivided focus.

When Heaven delights, the qi of great peace emerges, and nothing fails to be born and completed. When Heaven resents, the qi of punishment and harm arises, and none escape injury—all things suffer its poison, thus sharing the same sorrow.

If Heaven does not guard its spirit, the Three Luminaries dim; if Earth does not guard its spirit, mountains and rivers collapse; if humans do not guard their spirit, the body perishes; if the myriad things do not guard their spirit, they wither and decay. Therefore, returning to it is called strength; failing to return and merely preserving oneself is called dissolution and demise.

**The Method of Harmonizing Yin and Yang**
From Heaven comes Earth,
from the sun comes the moon,
from yin comes yang,
from spring comes autumn,
from summer comes winter,
from day comes night,
from left comes right,
from exterior comes interior,
from white comes black,
from brightness comes darkness,
from hardness comes softness,
from male comes female,
from front comes back,
from above comes below,
from ruler comes minister,
from *jia* comes *yi*,
from *zi* comes *chou*,
from five comes six,
from trees come grasses,
from female comes male,
from rooster comes hen,
from mountains come hills.
This is the root and handle of the Dao,
the pivot of yin and yang,
the supreme intent of the numinous spirit.

**The Method for Longevity, Governance, and Great Peace**

The arising of the three qi as one is the root of spirit. One is essence, one is spirit, and one is qi. These three share a single position, fundamentally the qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Spirit is received from Heaven, essence from Earth, and qi from harmony. Together, they form a single Dao. Thus, spirit rides qi to move, while essence resides within. The three assist one another in governance. Therefore, those who desire longevity must cherish qi, revere spirit, and value essence.

To rectify great matters, one must do so through non-action. For non-action begets non-action—this is the constant law of Heaven and Earth, the art of spontaneity, swift as an echo or shadow. The superior person employs it to pacify the state, the middling person to prolong life, and the inferior person to govern the household. This may be called "achieving without acting" and "ordering without governing." The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self. By cherishing one’s own body, governance naturally returns.

**The Seven Methods for Resolving Delusion**

How does governing the self through virtue fare, and how does it govern the myriad people to bring about the qi of great harmony? Though good, if not understood, how can there be peace?

How does governing the self through benevolence and righteousness fare, and how does it govern the myriad people? Though good, if not understood, how can there be peace?

How does governing the self through ritual fare, and how does it govern the myriad people? Though good, if not understood, how can there be peace?

How does governing the self through culture fare, and how does it govern the myriad people by restraining them to prevent wrongdoing? Though good, if not understood, how can there be peace?

How does governing the self fare, and how does it govern the myriad people? Though good, if not understood, how can there be peace?

How does governing the self by abolishing weapons and armor fare, and how does it govern the myriad people? Though good, if not understood, how can there be peace?

These seven methods cannot be entirely absent, nor can they be purely practiced. The divine persons of antiquity governed themselves with fundamentals and governed the people with great arts. They enabled the myriad things to live, each attaining its proper place, making the six directions and eight quarters near and far rejoice, so that nothing lost its place. Only then could spontaneity prevail, pacifying the eight directions and distant lands, bestowing grace without losing even a hair.

Now, if one cannot nurture both root and branch, how can governance be achieved? These seven—supreme virtue, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, culture, law, and martial power—each governs differently. Though all are good, if not understood, each has its strengths, yet none can be abandoned or purely practiced. To govern the self, pacify the state, and bring about great peace, one must deeply grasp their secrets. To master them is the Dao. United, they uphold the One; divided, they are boundless. The Lord on High practices this, profound and unfathomable, named the model of penetrating illumination.

**The Method for Saving the Four Seas and Discerning Superiority and Inferiority**

Heaven generates three ranks of people: the first is Heaven-born, the second Earth-born, and the third of human kind. Those who receive their mandate from Heaven become rulers; those who receive it from Earth become ministers; those who receive it from humanity become the people. The ruler acts in accordance with Heaven, the minister in accordance with Earth, following and serving their superior. The people belong to the minister and serve in turn.

Only when these three qi govern as one can success be achieved. Thus, the stability of the superior depends on the goodness of the minister. When the minister’s duties are well-ordered, the people follow the constant way. When both people and ministers are good, the ruler is enlightened, and governance endures. Great peace is achieved through the practice of the Dao. When the three qi are all good and align with the pattern, embracing virtue and power without harming one another, the ruler of great virtue governs the Dao to pacify the world, save the four seas, extend grace to the barbarians, and prevent misfortune from arising. Goodness increases daily, and calamity cannot come.

The middling person studies the Dao to become a minister, assisting in governance, measuring their household, and averting disaster. The lesser practitioner of the Dao harms their parents, wanders far away, their virtue slight and power meager, barely preserving their body. How can they assist an enlightened king and aid the state? Those who can pacify the four seas are aided by Heaven. The minister assists in governance, consulting with Earth. Those who merely preserve themselves follow a narrow and small Dao, incapable of governance. Though these three types all transcend the world, their longevity and old age differ in greatness, do they not?

**The Effects of Spirit’s Departure and Stay as Proof of the Dao**

The divine person says: "Illuminating conduct and verifying the Dao—where does the mandate lie?" This makes people clearly awaken and know the origin of their mandate. The method examines who holds to correctness. People are born following yin and yang: yang is always correct, yin is always deviant; yang is always present, yin is always absent; yang constantly grows, yin constantly diminishes; yang constantly generates, yin constantly destroys.

People change three times a day, resembling the three qi. Their governance differs, contending and conflicting, not following one another. Yet habit makes them constant. Those who preserve the human form and appearance are auspicious. Only those with the true Dao can focus their essence and stand apart. Those who do not study cannot know the effects of spirit’s departure and stay. Manifest things cannot be concealed.

Thus, the noble person controls the corpse but not the ghost. When people are not asleep, walking, sitting, speaking, and acting, they distinguish clearly between right and wrong, stand and move correctly, and use language as a standard. At such times, their spirit is present. When they close their eyes to sleep, light and shadow withdraw inward, and what they conceive remains unspoken—spirit is within. When they fall into deep sleep, spirit departs to wander, the body cannot move, the mouth cannot speak, the ears cannot hear, and they merge with the myriad spirits. Only qi remains—clear proof.

Thus, spirit must always be guarded. Guarding it brings long life; losing it exhausts one’s mandate. Those who attain the Dao do so through will and thought; those who lose the Dao do so through will and thought.

**The Method for Saving the Deluded and Assisting the Emperor**

The great Dao transforms without constancy, gazing across ten thousand miles...

The boundless extends above and below, circulating through the six directions. To guard it brings fortune; to fail to guard it brings harm. The opening and closing of yin and yang form the constant principle. It is bestowed upon those of the Dao, enabling the virtuous to practice it—thus their lifespan matches that of heaven and earth.

Virtue has degrees of excellence, and affairs have roots and branches. All things follow the Dao in this: those on the rise encounter goodness, while those in decline encounter misfortune. It is like the land—good soil yields goodness, while poor soil yields adversity. The noble align with heaven, while the base are mired in marsh. The seated are masters, the moving are transient guests. This is the fullness of the Dao: the virtuous cultivate it to create blessing, the wicked cultivate it to create disaster. The virtuous gain it as fortune and virtue. The exalted use it to ride in carriages, the lowly use it to walk on foot. The sagely and wise use it to transcend the world, while petty men gain it yet do not harm one another. All of this is the Dao.

Teachings do not appear twice, and time does not return. Hasten to instruct the emperor, that he may practice the Dao of Great Peace. When the Dao is practiced, the self transcends the world, and merit aids all living beings across the six directions.

**Appendix: Fragmentary Texts of the Scripture of Great Peace**

When heaven loses its balance of yin and yang, its Dao is thrown into chaos; when earth loses its balance of yin and yang, its resources are disrupted; when people lose their balance of yin and yang, their posterity is cut off; when ruler and minister lose their balance of yin and yang, their governance fails; when the Five Phases and Four Seasons lose their balance of yin and yang, disasters arise. Now heaven hangs its signs as models for humanity—thus one must comply and follow them.

*(Annotation from the *Book of Later Han*, *Biography of Xiang Kai*)*
The Perfected One further asked: "Why are so few children born today?"
The Heavenly Master replied: "Excellent question! It is not that the act is not performed, but that it is not done with proper intent. If one wishes to conceive, one must open the jade gate and plant the seed within—like sowing in spring, where ten seeds harmonize and ten grow. But if the act is performed out of season, it is like planting in the tenth month: all ten seeds perish, and none survive. If the Perfected One wishes to know this more deeply, consider barren women: even if the act is performed a hundred times a day, nothing is conceived. This is like sowing in a place where nothing grows. Thus the sages of antiquity never recklessly planted in barren soil, for that is called wasting seed and exhausting qi, yielding nothing. Now that the qi of Great Peace has arrived, if some still fail to bear children, they sever the continuity of heaven and earth, causing the nation’s population to dwindle. The principle of governing a state is this: a large population makes a state prosperous; a small one makes it poor. Now the qi of the Celestial August One has descended—when the qi of the Celestial August generates life, it will multiply ten thousandfold the beginnings of heaven and earth."

What constitutes excessive speech? A single word that brings great misfortune is the speech of the highest excess. A single word that brings humiliation is the speech of the middle excess. A single word that leads to ruin is the speech of the lowest excess. The ancient sages and worthies filled the space between heaven and earth with their words, yet still lamented their inadequacy—thus disasters never ceased. Later generations of worthies and sages repeated these words, and the world took them as models, never tiring of their speech. Thus words that eliminate harm are always too few, for good words are never excessive, and bad words are never too few. Therefore, the ancients, when about to speak, always reflected deeply. The sagely heart-mind issued forth and became scriptures, established as models for humanity. The foolish, when they speak, bring disaster upon themselves, only to harm themselves in return.
*(From the *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, Scroll 89. Also found in Scroll 92, *Essential Records of Discussions on Immortal Registers*, with the phrase "filled the space between heaven and earth with their words" adding a "words" after "issued.")*

Later learners of the Dao each have their rank and grade, ascending to the ultimate—Perfected Immortals and Divine Transcendents.
*(From the *Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era*, Scroll 660)*
In the time of the Three August Ones of antiquity, people’s qi was pure, and they deeply understood the ultimate truths of heaven and earth. Thus they all studied the true Dao and thereby attained the impartiality of heaven and earth. The method of seeking the Dao takes stillness as its foundation. When the heart-mind and spirit are clear, they unite with the Dao, opening ignorance to reveal brightness like the midday sun. Those who do not study the Dao are like those lost in a dark room, unable to find their way. Thus the sagely and wise are ever vigilant.
*(From the *Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era*, Scroll 668)*

When wicked persons enter the Dao, they harm and corrupt good people—just as an unskilled craftsman ruins fine timber, or a clumsy woman spoils fine cloth, never achieving any good work. Yet the wicked and the good are as opposite as a healthy person eating fine delicacies, growing robust on rich fare, while a sick person, though offered plain rice, refuses to eat and eventually dies of illness. When wicked persons hear good words of exhortation, it is like offering delicacies to one on the verge of death—far from reforming, they turn to greater evil.

Good persons rejoice at the sight of other good persons; the worthy rejoice at the sight of the worthy; the wise rejoice at the sight of the wise; the wicked rejoice at the sight of the wicked; the treacherous rejoice at the sight of the treacherous—each delights in their own kind.

If a child does not exert every effort to serve their parents, if a disciple does not exert every effort to serve their master, if a minister does not exert every effort to serve their lord—these three failures in conduct are unvirtuous, and their guilt cannot be absolved.

The *Inner Chapters on Cultivating Perfection from the Scripture of Great Peace* states: Before ascending to heaven, the Great Perfected One of Highest Clarity, without exception, selected their life-destined day to practice the four graded methods and secrets. Later, they trod the Dipper stars, followed the earth’s veins, ascended through the celestial gate, and entered the Golden Palace and Jade Terrace to become a sagely lord.

*(Cited in* The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearls*, Scroll 15, annotation)*

The *Scripture of Great Peace* records: The Perfected Lord received the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command and the divine radiance of the sacred scripture, commanding the celestial soldiers and seizing the celestial passes and earthly axes. The two demon kings suddenly appeared in the form of a colossal green-black turtle, their shapes shifting five times. One manifested as a serpent of ten thousand fathoms, its form changing three times.

The Perfected Lord soared into the void, pacing the celestial stems and treading the Dipper, transforming into a body a thousand fathoms tall. Brandishing the *Kuixu* sword, he struck and shattered the two demons. Each retracted their forms—the turtle shrank to the size of a five-inch fist, the serpent to a three-foot whip. Their bodies merged, and the Perfected Lord trampled them beneath his feet.

The transformations of the two demons are here reverently depicted:

**Green-Black Turtle:**
1. First transformation: golden-hued, its shell seams dark green.
2. Second transformation: jade-like, its shell seams laced with gold.
3. Third transformation: yellowish-green, its shell patterns luminous blue.
4. Fourth transformation: emerald-green, its shell seams laced with silver.
5. Fifth transformation: dragon-headed and turtle-bodied, emitting purple-golden light, its shell inlaid with jade.

**Giant Serpent:**
1. First transformation: golden in appearance, its scales like red cinnabar.
2. Second transformation: its body a blue-green hue, its scales threaded with golden lines.
3. Final transformation: its head like a hornless dragon, its body yellowish-green, its scales interspersed with gold and jade.

*(Cited in the* Sutra of the Wondrous Spell of the Great Sage of Mysterious Heaven, the Perfected Warrior*, Scroll 6, from the* Exalted One’s Transmission of the Divine Martial True Warrior’s Origin*)*

*(Note: This passage may not belong to the* Scripture of Great Peace*. It is provisionally retained pending further verification.)*

The numinous operates by the Dao, not by virtue. Thus, those who employ the Dao align with the divine luminaries, while those who employ virtue conspire with spirits. The Dao and virtue differ in clarity: contemplating spirits and humans reveals their mutual dependence, all made visible. *Dao Essentials: Scripture on the Ranks of Spirits, Deities, and Ghosts*

The great spirits are like loyal ministers of a state, governing and aiding the public office—they are called the great spirits. Yet even great spirits harbor minor self-interest; when the Heavenly Lord learns of it, they are demoted. Thus, they dare not slacken. How then can lesser spirits attain ease? *Dao Essentials: Scripture on the Ranks of Spirits, Deities, and Ghosts*

The spirits of the four seasons are like wind and water, swaying between uprightness and perversity according to human intent. When humans are upright, they are upright; when humans are perverse, they are perverse. Therefore, one must find the right person to establish affairs. Without the right person, the Dao is difficult to employ. Water naturally conforms to the shape of its vessel, yet the vessel’s form is not constant. Qi and wind likewise follow human governance, shifting between good and evil without constancy—this is its clear warning. The spirits of Heaven and Earth, along with wind and qi, respond to humans as a reflection, serving as a clear warning. *Dao Essentials: Scripture on the Ranks of Spirits, Deities, and Ghosts*

Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, baleful qi has never ceased; when cut off, it rises again. Why is this? Its origins stretch far into the past. It began with the governance of former kings, who slightly lost hold of their guiding principles. Disasters never ceased, and each generation inherited the burden, accumulating until great wickedness arose, causing profound harm. Movements became omens, one following another, giving rise to inauspiciousness that harmed all nations. Its origins are indeed distant. Kings, unaware, passed down the burden and could not suppress it. People’s grievances cried out to Heaven, causing the true Dao to lose its way. Royal governance was wounded, and good responses were rare. Human intent grew impure, making transformation ever harder, while perverse qi stirred. Though emperors grieved and wished to stop it, they were as helpless as the parched. Even with the benevolence of ten thousand men, a ruler could not halt this cascading calamity. Thus, they came to believe that doing good was futile and that the Heavenly Dao was unknowing. To restrain the people from evil, they despaired of reform and instead turned to harsh punishments, inflicting suffering. One person’s transgression extended to their neighbors, deepening the web of grievances, and baleful qi doubled daily. They deemed morality and scriptures useless, abandoned them, and each pursued their own schemes, chasing profit and rank. Those who struck the mark in this struggle were deemed superior—this is the disordering of Heaven’s order. How can governance without the Dao align with the heart of August Heaven? Heaven has long been afflicted, and the imbalance of yin and yang is its clear proof.

When governance accords with Heaven’s heart, perversity can be dispelled, and order is easily restored. Thus, the present teaching imparts the Supreme August Flourishing Peace’s foremost Dao. Once obtained and swiftly practiced, evil can be eradicated, and Heaven’s protection of the good will be evident. Though the disasters of former kings have accumulated, they can be eliminated in a single day. Now, if an emperor rules within a hundred *li* with Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness, the people of ten thousand *li* will all receive his grace. Fathers will be kind, children filial; households will be sufficient, and none will commit evil. *Dao Canon Discourses*, Scroll 4: *Disasters and Anomalies*

When a ruler deeply grasps Heaven’s intent, the supreme Dao abides in protection. There will be a hundred auspicious signs and not a single inauspicious event. *Dao Canon Discourses*, Scroll 4: *Auspicious Omens*

In ancient times, the perfected observed that celestial spirits consumed qi and emulated their practice, learning to ingest qi. True spirits came to aid their governance, dwelling within the perfected’s abdomen. The bodies of the ancient true immortals were merely the dwellings of perfected beings. *Dao Canon Discourses*, Scroll 4: *Embryonic Respiration*

Humans originally arise from the primordial qi of chaos. Qi generates essence, essence generates spirit, and spirit generates luminosity. Rooted in the qi of yin and yang, qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, and spirit into luminosity. Those who seek longevity should guard their qi and unite with spirit, preventing essence from leaving the body. Contemplate the union of these three as one; over time, refinement will naturally manifest. The body will gradually lighten, essence will grow brighter, radiance will intensify, and the heart will find great peace, filled with joy—this is the response of the Great Peace’s qi.

Cultivate the inner to reflect the outer. Within, attain longevity; without, attain governance. Without exerting strength, one naturally achieves Great Peace. *Secret Instructions of the Sage Lord of the Scripture of Great Peace* (hereafter *Secret Instructions*)

The method of guarding the One and attaining luminosity: before refinement is achieved, close the eyes in profound darkness, and no light appears within. *Secret Instructions*—guarding the One for an extended time naturally generates luminosity. Radiantly, the four directions become visible; following the light, one travels afar and perceives the body’s form and countenance in full. The host of spirits will gather, thus enabling the body’s transformation into spirit. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One and attaining luminosity: when luminosity is a true blue-green, pure and bright, it is the luminosity of Lesser Yang. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One and attaining luminosity: when luminosity is a true yellow with blue-green, it is the light of Central Harmony, the finest medicine of the Dao. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One and attaining luminosity: when luminosity is a true white like clear water, it is the luminosity of Lesser Yin. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One and attaining luminosity: when luminosity is a true black, clear as gazing into water, it is the light of Greater Yin. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One and attaining luminosity: when the four directions are all dark yet the abdomen is thoroughly illuminated, this is the luminosity of Supreme Harmony, the Dao of Great Compliance. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One and attaining luminosity: when both outer and inner are dark, with no affiliation and nothing to behold, this person is perverse and disordered—swiftly aid them with prescriptions and medicines. Seek within the seven passages above. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One restores youth in old age, turns white hair black again, and makes fallen teeth regrow. *Secret Instructions*

Guarding the One for one month adds a year to one’s lifespan; for two months, two years; and so on in succession. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: at first, when dwelling in seclusion, one should choose thick walls and heavy barriers to shut out the noise of clamor. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: when luminosity permeates the six directions, the body remains unharmed. One may thus live out one’s years, and one’s children will attain longevity. *Secret Instructions*

Guard the One without fail, and all affairs will naturally reach completion; swiftly dispel all worries—what more could one seek? *Secret Instructions*

Guard the One without cessation, and the scholar who desires freedom from care must not deceive himself—rest with hands folded. *Secret Instructions*

Guarding the One is the path of enduring wandering; maintain constant vigilance, and calamities and misfortunes will depart. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: the divine medicine comes of itself. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: what harms others does not harm you, for each person possesses something that others do not. Tigers and wolves do not gaze upon you, dragons do not rise, and all poisonous creatures flee from your form. If you wish to live free from care forever, seek unity with the One; the hundred spirits and thousand ghosts cannot contend with you. Guard it with unwavering focus, and disasters will not befall you. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: do not speak of its root, but carefully seal its gate; do not dare to leak it, but vigilantly preserve its spirit. When the outer is dark and the inner luminous, the One may then be achieved. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: it is to wander with the spirits. The ten thousand spirits come of their own accord, shining brightly and becoming your companions. *Secret Instructions*

If one wishes to guard the One, joy and anger become illnesses; without joy or anger, the One may then be perceived. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: within, there are five guardians; without, six signs. The eleven spirits share a single gateway. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: contemplate the formless origin, where essence and fluids unite, and the One arises from this union. Shedding old age to return to youth, one may attain longevity. If you guard the One, do not let many know of it; guard it without retreat, and there is nothing you will not know. All you seek will be obtained—attain it while seated in stillness. If you desire great joy, know the One; renounce glory and renown, and the One will be fitting. If you wish to nurture old age, guard the One early. Rest on a level bed, preserve the One, and you will be sated without eating, free from the decline of age. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One begins gradually; guard it over time, and by a hundred days, the One will manifest. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: do not strive for cleverness, and the One will act of itself. *Secret Instructions*

If one wishes to guard the One, it is to commune with the spirits. Rest in non-action, turn inward to seek within the abdomen; lying in the west of the mountains, you will know the east. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One is the root of the ten thousand spirits. When the root runs deep, the spirit is tranquil, and death has no entry. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: the old and the young differ in measure, each according to their nature, and the One will meet them accordingly. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: embrace poverty and delight in humility, always seeking within; the One will then appear, and you will know that neither high nor low status matters. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: eating little is the root. The true spirit favors purity, while filth and excrement cloud the qi. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: silently contemplate its essence, cycling without beginning or end, boundless and without limit. The face and eyes will radiate light, and the spirit will be thoroughly enlightened. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: a hundred days bring lesser stillness, two hundred days bring middle stillness, and three hundred days bring great stillness. Within, there is constant joy, and the Three Corpses have already fallen. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One involves three hundred and sixty-six numbers. Each number has one essence, and each essence has one spirit. When the practice of guarding the One is complete, this spirit may be perceived. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: there are five inner governances. If the mind wanders outward, the inner governance is lost. If one guards the One poorly, the inner turns rebellious while the outer remains vigilant, and the One becomes an adversary. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: there are always six Controller Spirits who jointly assess human transgressions. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One is the master of all spirits, the root of human goodness, the method of dispelling misfortune, and the gateway to attaining blessings. One who guards the One is the master of the divine vessel; from one spirit, they accumulate to ten thousand spirits, and when all share a single vessel, the Dao is attained. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: if within there is great rebellion and disorder, the Five Palaces fall into discord, and the Six Bowels lose their guardianship. The host of spirits, alarmed, will all depart and report to the Hall of Light, first manifesting in the complexion of the face. Heaven and Earth will both know of it. When the host of spirits departs, the body is doomed to die. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: when one does good, its effects may be seen. Today, if one does good and remains pure, the divine luminosity gradually brightens. At first like the glow of a firefly, in time it becomes like lightning. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: outwardly, one should practice benevolence and bestow kindness as merit, without expecting repayment—loyalty and filial piety are the same. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One brings a hundred blessings but also a hundred misfortunes. If one’s guard is not steadfast and external affairs are many, the hundred spirits will contend, and victory and defeat will follow one another. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: within, always focus the spirit, cherishing it like an infant—how then could the hundred misfortunes dare to encroach? *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One is one with Heaven, Earth, and the divine luminaries. Moving from Yin to Yang, there is nothing it does not penetrate. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One: first know the will of Heaven, which gives life to the ten thousand things. It governs without speech, accomplishes without ruling, and the Dao brings enduring vision. *Secret Instructions*

The method of guarding the One allows one to know the ten thousand things, yet the ten thousand things cannot know the One. One who guards the One may transcend the world, dispel disasters, serve a lord, avoid death, govern a household, serve the spirits, avoid poverty, heal illness, attain longevity, and preserve enduring vision. It is the origin of primordial qi and the pivot of the ten thousand things. Heaven, if it does not guard the One, loses its clarity; Earth, if it does not guard the One, loses its tranquility; the sun, if it does not guard the One, loses its brightness; the moon, if it does not guard the One, loses its essence; the stars, if they do not guard the One, lose their course; mountains, if they do not guard the One, cannot avoid collapse; water, if it does not guard the One, gives rise to dust and earth; spirits, if they do not guard the One, cannot give life; and humans, if they do not guard the One, cannot live.

The One as the root—all affairs proceed from it.
Know the One, and all affairs are complete.

**Secret Essence:**
The essence of the Great Yin becomes the tortoise, concealed within the depths of the abyssal source.

**Preface to the *Repeated Writings of the Scripture of Great Peace* from the Dunhuang Manuscripts:**
The August Heavenly Golden Gate Later Sage, the Supreme Emperor of Great Peace, is the High Emperor of the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, descendant of the Earthly Thearch. Born with numinous marvels, he early awakened to the Great Dao. His meritorious deeds were inscribed upon the cinnabar terrace, and his title was recorded in the Supreme Ultimate. Invested with the mandate of the Upper Clarity, he governs the host of perfected beings and oversees the myriad people. Mountains and rivers, seas and the eight extremities, the nine boundaries—none are not subject to the Emperor’s authority and receive his decrees.

The Emperor has a Grand Preceptor, a Chief Minister, a Grand Steward, a Grand Tutor, dukes, ministers, marquises, and earls—all are attendants of the Upper Perfected, who devise plans and compose canons, transmitting instructions to those below. Thus, the *Repeated Writings of Great Peace* were first transmitted to the Chief Minister, the Green Lad Lord; then to the Grand Steward, the King Lord of Western City; the King Lord transmitted them to his disciple Bo He, and Bo He to his disciple Gan Ji.

Gan Ji initially contracted a grave illness, nearly beyond cure. He sought healing from Bo He, who said: “I transmit to you the original text of the *Scripture of Great Peace*. You may expand it into one hundred seventy scrolls, arranged into three hundred sixty chapters, and disseminate it throughout the world. Bestow it upon a virtuous lord to bring about Great Peace. Not only will your illness be cured, but you will also transcend the world.” Gan Ji received the teachings, delved into their profound meaning, and expounded them into a doctrine.

During the late Eastern Han, when China was ravaged by chaos, he carried the scripture southward to Wu and Yue. One hundred thirty *li* east of Yue, there was a mountain named Great Peace, and a stream called Gan Stream. The traces remain to this day, and the gentry and commoners flocked to him with reverence.

At that time, Sun Ce had just stabilized the Jiangnan region and was establishing his hegemonic enterprise. All around Sun Ce revered Gan Ji, but Sun Ce, deeming him a disturber of people’s hearts, falsely accused him of crimes and bound him. Sun Ce declared: “If rain falls during this prolonged drought, I shall release him.” Suddenly, dark clouds gathered from all directions, and a violent storm erupted. Sun Ce grew even more resentful and ordered Gan Ji’s execution, his head to be displayed at the city gate. One day, a fierce wind arose, and the corpse vanished without a trace. Gan Ji then changed his name and departed for Shu.

Sun Ce, gazing into a mirror, saw Gan Ji’s head within it. Soon after, his face erupted in sores, and he died. At the time, all believed that the humiliation of a divine immortal had brought about his early demise. Thus, when Sun Quan ascended, he increasingly believed in and practiced the Daoist arts, studying under Master Ge the Immortal. Master Jie also frequented his court.

During the upheavals of the Southern Dynasties, the *Scripture of Great Peace* ceased to circulate. By the Liang, Master Tao’s disciple, Huan Fakai—from Wuyang County in Dongyang—discovered the original text of the *Scripture of Great Peace* in a valley stream. He took it home, but illness struck. Master Tao said: “The teachings of Great Peace are not yet meant to spread. You forcibly took it, hence your illness.” He instructed Huan to return it to its original place, and shortly after, he recovered.

In the reign of Emperor Xuan of Chen, a fisherman in the coastal mountains found a silk manuscript, its radiance illuminating the sky. Emperor Xuan dispatched the Daoist Zhou Zhixiang to offer prayers and request the text. Thereupon, he obtained this scripture, its cinnabar writing resplendent. Zhou Zhixiang was well-versed in the meaning of the *Scripture of Great Peace* and often lectured on it, earning the title “Master of the Great Peace Dharma.” Emperor Xuan vaguely understood the scripture’s purport but could not put it into practice. Among the five rulers of the Chen, Emperor Xuan was the most virtuous.

Since its loss during the Southern Dynasties, though China revived, the teachings endured but were seldom practiced. Through the passage of ages, this text has not perished. It has been transcribed, treasured, and preserved, awaiting the wise and sagacious.

In the *renchen* cycle, the Sagely Lord descended, beholding the perfect principles of Great Peace. The Immortal Marquis took office, and the people of heaven received its blessings. Thus, the merit of restoring the ancient purity of this text was made manifest.

In all, there are four sections, ninety-five chapters, and two thousand one hundred twenty-eight characters—all comprising the original text of the *Scripture of Great Peace*. The three hundred sixty-two chapters were elaborated by Gan Ji from the original text and circulated together in the world. They complement and complete the teachings, ensuring no error in transmission.

**Daoist Canon, Zi Category:**
*Clarification:* The *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, Scroll 64, records that during the reign of Emperor Xuan of Chen, Master Zhou Zhixiang of the *Scripture of Great Peace* expounded its teachings at the Zhenzhi Abbey. This may be consulted for reference.

*Further Clarification:* Huan Kai, styled Yan Shu, was also called Master Fakai. The account of Huan Kai obtaining the *Scripture of Great Peace* resembles that in *Volume One of the Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* and the *Taiping Imperial Digest*, Volume 666, which cites the *Biographies of Daoist Scholars* on Huan Kai’s acquisition of the *Scripture of Great Peace*.

**Textual Research on the *Scripture of Great Peace*:**
In Fan Ye’s *Book of the Later Han*, *Biography of Xiang Kai*: In the ninth year of *yanxi* during the reign of Emperor Huan (166 CE), Xiang Kai submitted a memorial: “Previously, Gong Chong of Langye presented the divine writings of Gan Ji, but they did not meet with imperial approval.” He submitted another memorial: “The divine writings previously presented by Gong Chong are fundamentally devoted to revering Heaven and Earth and following the Five Phases. They also contain methods for prospering the state and multiplying descendants. Their text is easily understood, aligning with the classics. Yet Emperor Shun did not practice them, and thus the imperial lineage did not flourish.”

Xiang Kai’s *Biography* further states: During the reign of Emperor Shun, Gong Chong of Langye journeyed to the imperial court and presented one hundred seventy scrolls of divine scripture obtained by his master, Yu Ji, at Quyang’s Fountainhead. The texts were bound in pale white silk, edged in vermilion, with azure headings and crimson titles, and were called the *Scripture of the Great Peace and Pure Rule*. Their teachings took the Yin-Yang and Five Phases as their foundation, though they were interspersed with shamanic and miscellaneous sayings. The authorities memorialized that what Gong Chong had presented was heretical and unorthodox, and thus it was collected and stored away. Later, Zhang Jiao acquired much of this scripture.

Li Xian, Prince Zhanghuai of the Tang, annotates: “The divine scripture is what is now known as the Daoist *Scripture of Great Peace*. The text is divided according to the ten celestial stems—*jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *wu*, *ji*, *geng*, *xin*, *ren*, *gui*—with each stem comprising seventeen scrolls.”

The *Disquisition on Principle to Dispel Doubt* by Mouzi of the Han states: “One hundred seventy scrolls of divine scripture.”

The *Hongming Collection*, *juan* 1: In Ge Hong’s *Baopuzi*, *Chapter on Distant Perusal*, it is recorded: “Fifty scrolls of the *Scripture of Great Peace*.” Additionally, “One hundred seventy scrolls of the *Scripture of Jia Yi*.”

In Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*: Gong Chong was a native of Langye. Gifted in literature, he composed over one hundred scrolls of writings. He studied under the transcendent Yu Ji.

During the reign of Emperor Yuan of the Han, Gong Chong accompanied Yu Ji to the springs of Quyang, where they encountered celestial transcendents who bestowed upon Yu Ji ten sections of the *Scripture of Great Peace*, inscribed in vermilion on green silk. Yu Ji practiced its teachings and attained the Dao, then transmitted it to Gong Chong. Later, Gong presented this scripture to the throne. Its contents extensively discuss the waxing and waning of yin and yang, calamities and blessings, encompassing the Way of Heaven, the Way of Earth, and the Way of Man. It declares that rulers who employ its principles may govern the state and attain longevity—such is its essential purport. (Note: *Gong Chong* is also written as *Gong Song*. The *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Transcendents Through the Ages* by Zhao Daoyi of the Yuan records the same account in the biography of Gong Chong.)

*Records of Forgotten Matters* states: Initially, during the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han, Gong Chong of Langye presented at court the divine scripture he had received from his master Yu Ji at the springs of Quyang—white silk with vermilion borders, titled the *Dao of the Green Lapel of Great Peace*, comprising over one hundred scrolls. (This appears in the commentary to the biography of Sun Ce in *Records*, *juan* 1.)

*The Pivotal Meaning of the Seven Sections of the Daoist Teachings* by Meng Anpai of the Liang states: During the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han, Gong Chong presented the one hundred seventy scrolls of divine scripture obtained by his master Yu Ji, titled the *Scripture of Great Peace*.

The Dunhuang manuscript of Cheng Xuanying’s *Introduction to the Laozi* records: During the reign of King Nan, the *Scripture of Great Peace* and one hundred eighty precepts were conferred upon Gan Shi (i.e., Yu Ji).

The Tang monk Falin’s *Disquisition on Rectifying Errors* states: In the era of King Nan, Qian Shi (suffering from illness) was moved to seek the Venerable Lord Lao, who bestowed upon him one hundred eighty precepts along with one hundred seventy sections of the *Scripture of Great Peace*. (From *Extensive Collection on the Propagation of the Sublime*, *juan* 13. Note: *Qian Shi* is a corruption of *Gan Shi*; *qian* is a scribal error for *gan*.)

The Tang monk Xuanyi’s *Disquisition on Discerning Truth* states: There exists a *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred eighty scrolls, composed by Yu Ji of Shu. This individual was adept at concealing his traces and did not exert himself in transcribing Buddhist scriptures.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* expounds extensively on the methods by which emperors govern the state, as well as matters such as yin-yang and the generation of life, all arranged according to the *jiazi* cyclical signs into its respective sections. (Note: *Eight doubts* is an error for *seven characters*.)

The Tang monk Daoshi’s *Forest of Gems in the Garden of Dharma*, *juan* 69, *Disquisition on Refuting Heresies* states: *Scripture of Great Peace*.

The Tang monk Wang Xuanhe’s *Pearl-Bag of the Three Caverns*, *juan* 9: Laozi, together with Yin Xi, journeyed to the Western Regions and composed the *Sutra of Laozi’s Transformation of the Barbarians* in 640,000 words for the Hu king. Later, upon returning to China, he composed the *Scripture of Great Peace*.

Also, Wang Xuanhe’s *Categorized Matters of the Supreme Clarity Dao*, *juan* 1: During the Southern Dynasties, between the Liu-Song and Qi, the Qiantang native Chu Boyu was fond of reading the *Scripture of Great Peace*.

The Tang monk Wang Songnian’s *String of Pearls from the Garden of Immortals*, middle *juan*: Yu Ji was a native of Beihai. He suffered from leprosy for several years, and no medicine could cure him. Seeing an old man selling medicine in the market, surnamed Bo and named He, he went to inform him. Bo He then bestowed upon him two scrolls of plain-text scripture, saying, “This scripture will not only cure your illness but also grant you longevity.” Yu Ji received it—it was the *Scripture of Great Peace*. Practicing it, his illness was cured. He then ascended the high peak of the Diao Terrace Village in Shangyu, where he expanded this scripture into one hundred seventy scrolls.

(Note: The *Pearl-Bag of the Three Caverns*, *juan* 1, cites a brief passage from the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*: Bo He bestowed two scrolls of plain-text scripture upon Gan Ji, admonishing him, “Return and transcribe this scripture, expanding it to one hundred fifty scrolls.” This does not explicitly name the *Scripture of Great Peace*, and the mention of one hundred fifty scrolls is also likely erroneous.)

The Tang monk Du Guangting’s *Ritual of the Yellow Register Fast of the Supreme Lord Lao*, *juan* 52: Lord Lao bestowed the *Scripture of Great Peace* upon Gan Ji.

Also found in Du Guangting’s *Ready-Made Ritual for the Great Yellow Register Fast of the Supreme Lord Lao*, *juan* 21, *Resembling Heaven and Earth*: During the reign of Emperor Shun of the Later Han, at Quyang Spring, a divine immortal scripture in one hundred scrolls was obtained. Of these, seventy scrolls were written on white silk with vermilion borders, green silk, and vermilion characters, titled the *Green Dao of Great Peace*.

The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia*, *juan* 673, *Biographies of Immortals of the Grotto-Heavens*: Yu Ji was a native of Langye. He often wandered by the flowing waters of Quyang, where he obtained over one hundred scrolls of divine scripture, all with red borders, white silk, green headings, and vermilion characters, titled the *Green Register Scripture of Great Peace*.

The *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, *juan* 111, *Preface to the One Hundred Eighty Precepts Spoken by Lord Lao*: Lord Lao arrived at Langye and transmitted the Dao to Master Gan. Master Gan received the Daoist methods, thereby attaining the Dao, and was appointed as a Perfected One. He also transmitted the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls, divided into ten sections by the *jiazi* cyclical signs.

The *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, *juan* 39, *Scripture of the Inner Explanation of the Three Heavens*: The Supreme Lord transmitted the *Scripture of the Dao of Great Peace* to Gan Ji at Langye.

The Song scholar Xie Shouhao’s *Inner Meaning of the Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of the Upper Grade*: Lord Lao bestowed the Dao of Great Peace upon the Perfected One Gan Ji.

The *Catalogue of Missing Books in the Four Libraries*, compiled by Xu Song of the Qing from the *Yongle Encyclopedia*: Xiang Kai’s *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls.

The *History of the Song Dynasty*, *Treatise on Arts and Letters*: Xiang Kai’s *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls. (Note: Xiang Kai of the Later Han once presented Gan Ji’s divine scripture. Both of the above texts erroneously attribute the *Scripture of Great Peace* to Xiang Kai.)

The Yuan scholar Ma Duanlin’s *Comprehensive Examination of Literature*, *Bibliographic Treatise*: *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls.

The Yuan scholar Zhao Daoyi’s *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals and Those Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages*, *juan* 20, *Biography of Gan Ji*: At Quyang by the flowing waters, Gan Ji obtained over one hundred scrolls of divine scripture, all with red borders, white silk, green headings, and vermilion characters, titled the *Green Collar Scripture of Great Peace*. This occurred in the second year of the *heping* era of Emperor Cheng of Han, the year *jiawu*. It is said that Gan Ji personally received it from Lord Lao, and it is now the *Scripture of Great Peace* of the Daoist tradition. The scripture is divided into sections by the *jiazi* cyclical signs, with each section comprising seventeen scrolls.

The *Catalogue of Missing Scriptures in the Daoist Canon*, recorded by a Yuan scholar: *Scripture of Great Peace*.

The *Commentary on the Scripture of Non-Action* by an anonymous author: During the reign of Emperor Cheng, Lord Lao bestowed the *True Scripture of Great Peace* upon Gan Ji.

The *Biographies of Daoist Scholars*, *juan* 15: Huan Kai, styled Yanshu, was a native of Dantu in Donghai. At the beginning of the Liang dynasty, on the flat sands of Kunlun Mountain’s islets, there were three ancient lacquered boxes containing yellow silk inscribed with three copies of the *Scripture of Great Peace* transmitted by Master Gan. ...Huan Kai thus requested one copy from the villagers and returned to the capital to venerate it, first presenting it to Master Tao. Master Tao said, “This is the authentic ancient version of Master Gan.” ...

The *Pearl-Bag of the Three Caverns*, *juan* 1, *Preface to the Complex Text of the Scripture of Great Peace*: When Master Gan initially contracted a severe illness, nearly incurable, he sought out Bo He for a cure. Master Bo said, “I will transmit to you the original text of the *Great Peace*. You may expand it into one hundred seventy scrolls, compiling it into three hundred sixty chapters, and widely transmit it throughout the world. Bestow it upon virtuous rulers to bring about Great Peace, and not only will your illness be cured, but you will also transcend the world.”

*The Detailed Annotations on the "Catalogue of Daoist Canon Illuminated by the Bright Clouds"*, *juan* 4:
*External*, *Transmission*, *Propagation*, *Instruction*, and *Introduction* Sections of the *Scripture of Great Peace*

The detailed annotations state: “The *Scripture of Great Peace* was personally transmitted by the Most High Lord Lao. The scripture is divided according to the ten celestial stems: *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *wu*, *ji*, *geng*, *xin*, *ren*, and *gui*. Each stem comprises seventeen *juan*, totaling one hundred seventy *juan*. All expound on cultivating the body and nurturing nature, preserving essence and cherishing spirit. Internally, they govern the body for longevity; externally, they govern the state for Great Peace. They dispel disasters, cure illnesses, and are invariably efficacious.”

Note: In the *External* section of the *Daoist Canon* from the Ming Zhengtong era, the *Abstract of the Scripture of Great Peace* in ten *juan* across ten parts was mistakenly substituted for the first ten *juan* of the *Scripture of Great Peace*. This is because the *Abstract* was compiled through selective editing of the scripture, with each part of the *Abstract* corresponding to seventeen *juan* of the original.

From the hand-copied *Imperially Commissioned Comprehensive Catalogue of the Daoist Canon* by He Longxiang of the Qing:
*Scripture of Great Peace*, one hundred nineteen *juan* (many volumes missing).

From the *Catalogue of Daoist Books Printed by Private Workshops in the Present Dynasty*, compiled by He Longxiang of the Qing:
*Scripture of Great Peace*, over one hundred *juan*.

Note: The *Supplementary Continuation to the "Treatise on Arts and Letters" in the Book of Han* by Qian Dazhao of the Qing, the *Supplementary "Treatise on Arts and Letters" in the Later Han* by Gu Huai of the Qing, the *"Treatise on Arts and Letters" in the Later Han* by Yao Zhenzong, and the *Supplementary "Treatise on Arts and Letters" in the Later Han* by Zeng Pu all record the *Scripture of Great Peace in Pure Governance* in one hundred seventy *juan*. The above supplementary treatises have all been included in the second volume of the *Supplementary Compilations of the Twenty-Five Histories*, published by the Kaiming Book Company, and are readily accessible; thus, they are not elaborated here.
