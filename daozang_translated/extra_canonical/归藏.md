From the *Yuhan Shanfang Collection of Lost Books*, edited by Ma Guohan of the Qing Dynasty:

**Ma’s Preface:**
The *Guicang* comprises one fascicle, now fragmentary and incomplete.

The *Rites of Zhou*, "Spring Offices, Grand Diviner," states: "He oversees the methods of the Three Changes—first, the *Lianshan*; second, the *Guicang*; third, the *Zhouyi*." Zheng Xuan annotates: "The *Guicang* means that the myriad things all return and are stored within." Du Zichun says: "The *Lianshan* belongs to Fuxi; the *Guicang*, to the Yellow Emperor." Jia Gongyan’s subcommentary cites Zheng’s *Responses to Zhao Shang*: "Though no explicit text confirms this, altering it lacks basis; thus, we follow Zichun." Later masters generally regard them as the Xia and Shang [versions of the *Yi*].

The *Record of Rites*, "Evolution of Rites," records Confucius as saying: "I wished to observe the Way of the Shang, so I went to Song. Though evidence was insufficient, I obtained *Kun* and *Qian* there." Zheng’s annotation states: "The Shang’s book on yin and yang that survives is the *Guicang*," thus also identifying the *Guicang* as the Shang *Yi*.

The *Han History*, "Treatise on Arts and Letters," does not record it. The Jin *Central Catalog* first includes it. Ruan Xiaoxu’s *Seven Records* states: "The *Guicang* is a miscellaneous work on divination and various matters." The *History of the Sui*, "Treatise on Classics and Books," lists thirteen fascicles, with commentary by Xue Zhen, a military aide to the Grand Commandant of Jin. The *Tang History*, "Treatise on Arts and Letters," records the same number of fascicles. The Song *Revival Book Catalog* includes three chapters: *Initial Canon*, *Mother of Qi*, and *Root of the Milfoil*. Many scholars, considering it a later fabrication, cast doubt on its authenticity. Zheng Qiao’s *Comprehensive Treatises* argues: "It speaks of divination; its language is plain, its meaning ancient. Later scholars, finding it unrefined, suspect and discard it—yet do they not know that later generations could compose such texts?" Yang Shen also notes: "The *Lianshan* was stored in the Orchid Terrace; the *Guicang*, in the Grand Diviner’s archives," as seen in Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*. Thus, in the Later Han, both the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* still existed. One cannot dismiss them merely because the *Treatise on Arts and Letters* omits them. Examining its surviving hexagrams, such as:

*"Ju: There is a *ju*; there is a *gu*. Millet is brewed into wine, poured into twin flasks. Two ewes drink it; after three days, they become drunk. The knight has marshland—I take its fish."*

*"The good man obtains his jade; the noble man obtains his grain."*

*"There are wild ducks and mandarin ducks; there are geese and egrets."*

All employ rhymed verses, archaic and recitable, akin to the oracle phrases recorded in the *Zuo Tradition*. The *Forest of Hexagrams* by Jiao Yanshou derives from this. Though lines like "the sun is exhausted" or "the moon flees" verge on the fantastical, even the great *Yi* draws imagery from "dragons battling in the wild" or "a cartload of ghosts"—nothing to discredit it. However, as a Shang *Yi*, it records "King Wu’s secret divination" and "King Mu’s hexagram casting." Likely, the Zhou Grand Diviners, who preserved its methods, appended records of divinations and verifications to its chapters. Such texts could not have been composed by men of the Han or later.

Today, even the three Song chapters are lost. Zhu Xi’s *Investigation of Classical Meaning* compiles it in great detail, serving as the basis for this edition. Where omissions remain, I have supplemented and stitched them together, appending various scholars’ discussions into one fascicle. Comparing this with the so-called *Qi Tomb Guicang* in the transmitted *Three Tombs*, authenticity and forgery can be immediately discerned.

By Ma Guohan of Licheng, styled Zhuwufu.

**Guicang**

**Guicang: Initial Canon**
Zhu Zhen’s *Han River Yi* states: "The *Yi* of the *Guicang*—its *Initial Canon*—embodies the original intent of Fuxi."

**Initial Qian**
Gan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi* both record its contention.

Li Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses* and Hu Yigui’s *Wings of Enlightenment on the Zhou Yi*

**Initial Kun**
Gan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Kun*.

*"The blossoms of glory."*

*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment on the Zhou Yi*; Zhu’s *Investigation of Classical Meaning* cites it as "glorious glory."

**Initial Gen**
Gan Bao and Zhu Zhen both cite it as *Gen*. Li Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses* and Huang Zongyan’s *Images and Words of the Zhou Yi* cite it as *Hen*. Huang explains: "*Gen* is *hen* (fierce). *Gen* has the image of turning inward, silent and unsmiling, its countenance stern—thus taking its meaning from rigidity and fierceness?"

*"The fox barks sharply."*

*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.

**Initial Dui**
Gan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi* record its speech as sincere.

*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*

**Initial Li**
Gan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Kan*. Li Guo states: "To call *Kan* *luo* (toil): *luo* means labor. It signifies the myriad things laboring within *Kan*." Huang Zongyan says: "*Kan* is the hexagram of toil, hence derived from *lao* (labor) by phonetic loan and abbreviation. Nothing toils more than the ox, thus the character includes 'ox.'"

*"For celebration, the body does not move."*

*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.

**Initial Li**
Gan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi*.

*"Li gazes intently."*

*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*

**Initial Zhen**
Gan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation*; Zhu Zhen says *Zhen*. Li Guo states: "*Zhen* is *li* (order). *Li* means principle. As the Supreme emerges from *Zhen*, it is the beginning of the myriad things’ orderly patterns." Huang Zongyan says: "*Zhen* is *li*. *Li* should correspond to *Li* (Fire), but *Zhen* (Thunder) is not close—could it be that thunder orders the earth to emerge and resound?"

*"Like the rumbling of thunder."*

*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.

**Initial Xun**
Gan Bao’s *Zhou Rites Annotation* and Zhu Zhen’s *Collected Discourses on the Yi*: *"A bird is about to arrive and lowers its wings."*

*Western Stream Yi Discourses* and *Wings of Enlightenment*.

All hexagrams consist of six lines, as recorded in *Collected Discourses on the Yi*.

Wang Yinglin’s *Han Arts and Literature Annals Considerations*, Volume One.
Zhu Yuansheng’s *Comprehensive Study of the Three Yi* states: *"The* Guicang Yi *takes pure* Kun *as its first hexagram. Kun *represents Earth, within which all things are stored. The* Shuogua *says: ‘Kun *conceals them.’ This is the true mechanism of creation and nurturance, ever concealed within it. Yet each* yuan *has its own creative process—at the cusp of* guihai *and* jiazi *lies its concealment; each year has its own creative process—at the solstices of winter and summer lies its concealment; each day has its own creative process—at the juncture of midnight and noon lies its concealment. Thus, the* Guicang Yi *nowhere fails to employ its principle of concealment. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, sixteen are for concealment, and forty-eight for application. Qian *is the father of the sixty-four hexagrams, and* Kun *their mother. Kun *governs the hexagrams of concealment, while* Qian *governs those of application. Thus,* Kun *and* Qian *head the sixty-four hexagrams. Where there is concealment, there must be application; hence, pure* Kun *precedes even pure* Qian.*"*

Xu Shan’s *Four Yi* states: *"The sequence of hexagrams in the* Guicang *is:* Kun, Zhen, Kan, Gen, Dui, Li, Xun, Qian. *This is because* Zhen *emerges with one yang born beneath pure* Kun. *Thereafter, it advances to* Kan *and centers, then to* Gen *and ascends, meeting at the fifth line to yield* Dui *with its two yangs—yet one yin still remains above. At* Li, *the central yang ascends; at* Xun, *the initial yang enters the center, thus completing the form of pure* Qian. *This is the sequence of yang qi’s gradual growth. Reversing the process:* Xun *begins with one yin born beneath pure* Qian. *It then advances to* Li *and centers, then to* Dui *and ascends, meeting at the fifth line to yield* Gen *with its two yins—yet one yang still remains above. At* Kan, *the central yin ascends; at* Zhen, *the initial yin enters the center, thus completing the form of pure* Kun. *This is the sequence of yin qi’s gradual growth and yang qi’s return to concealment. The name ‘Guicang’ likely derives from this. Numerically, when proceeding from below upward, it begins with eight and ends with two, for yang qi arises from nothing into being—this is the principle of ‘knowing the future in reverse.’ When proceeding from below upward, it begins with two and ends with eight, for yang qi returns from being into nothing—this is the principle of ‘reckoning the past in sequence.’ The sages named it* Guicang *to teach people the Dao of returning to the origin and renewing the beginning."*

Following the sixty-four hexagrams as recorded in Li Guo’s *Western Stream Yi Discourses*—from *Qian* to *Matu*, totaling sixty hexagrams—four missing hexagrams are here supplemented.
*Kun*: As cited in *Western Stream Yi Discourses*, with four missing hexagrams filled in according to Jia Gongyan’s *Record of Rites Subcommentary*: *"This* Guicang Yi *takes* Kun *as its first,"* based on the *Initial Classic*.
*Qian*: As in *Western Stream Yi Discourses*, with the same method applied below.
*Tun*
*Meng*

"Ru," "Song," "Shi," "Bi," *Xiao Du Xu* (*Western Stream* states: "Xiao Xu is *Xiao Du Xu*.") Huang Zongxi says: "*Da Xu* and *Xiao Xu* are *Da Du Xu* and *Xiao Du Xu*; *du* takes the meaning of nurturing and transforming."

"Lü," "Tai," "Pi," "Tong Ren," "Da You," "Hen," "Xian," "Da Guo," "Yi," "Kun," "Jing," "Ge," "Ding," "Lü," "Feng," "Xiao Guo," *Lin Huo* (*Western Stream* states: "Lin is *Lin Huo*.")

"Guan," "Cui," *Cheng* (Huang Zongxi says: "*Sheng* is *Cheng*; the earth gives birth to wood—where soil is thick, trees flourish; where barren, they wither. This speaks of wood and earth being in balance.")

*Pu* (Huang Zongxi says: "*Bo* is *Pu*.")

"Fu," *Mu Wang* (Huang Zongxi says: "*Wu Wang* is *Mu Wang*; *mu* means ‘without,’ *wang* means ‘delusion’—there is no other meaning.")

*Da Du Xu* (*Western Stream* states: "*Da Xu* is *Da Du Xu*.")

*Qu* (Huang Zongxi says: "*Qu* should belong to *Guan*." Note: *Western Stream* has already cited *Guan*; Zhu Taishi Yizun’s *Jingyi Kao* takes "opposition" as its meaning, suggesting *Qu* precedes *San Jia Ren* and thus refers to *Kui*.)

*San Jia Ren* (Huang Zongxi says: "*Jia Ren* is *San Jia Ren*—its meaning cannot be determined.)

"Jie"

"Huan" (Huang Zongyan says: "*Huan* is *Luan*; in ancient script, characters might either include or omit radicals, leading to mutual interchange.")

*Jian*

*Li* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Jie* is *Li*; *li* also carries the meaning of gathering and dispersing.")

*Yuan* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Sun* is *Yuan*.")

*Xian* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Xian* is *Xian*." Zhu Taishi says: "Taking *Sun* as *Yuan* and placing *Xian* after it, then *Xian* signifies *Yi*.")

*Qin* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Qin* should belong to *Lǚ*." Zhu Taishi says: "Since *Qin* precedes *Heng*, it is *Xian*.")

*Heng*

*Gui*

*Ye* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Gui* should belong to *Jie*, and *Ye* to *Mingyi*." Note: *Western Stream* has already cited *Jie* and *Mingyi*. Zhu Taishi says: "The two names *Gui* and *Ye* cannot be definitively assigned to which hexagrams; if not *Guai* and *Gou*, then they must be *Shihe* and *Bi*." Note: In antiquity, contracts were derived from *Guai*, which aligns closely with the meaning of *Gui*; *Ye* carries the sense of *Gou*’s "encounter" and "taking a wife," so it is likely that *Gui* belongs to *Guai* and *Ye* to *Gou*.)

*Xun*

*Dui*

**Li**

*Luò* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Luò* should belong to *Qiān*.")

*Jiān* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Jiān* is *Qiān*.")
*Fēn* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Fēn* should belong to *Kuí*." Zhu Taishi says: "Taking *Qiān* as *Jiān* and placing *Fēn* after it, then *Fēn* signifies *Yù*.")

*Guīmèi*
*Jiàn*
*Jìn*
*Míngyí*

*Cénjì* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Cénjì* should belong to *Bì*." Zhu Taishi says: "Since *Cénjì* precedes *Wèijì*, it is *Jìjì*.")

*Wèijì* ◎ (upper *tuàn*, lower *chuò*) (Huang Zongyan says: "◎ is *Dùn*; its form and meaning are inherently connected, with no alternative interpretation.")

*Shǔ* (Huang Zongyan says: "*Gǔ* is *Shǔ*, for *Shǔ* is also an insect.")
*Mǎtú* (Zhu Taishi says: "Taking *Gǔ* as *Shǔ* and placing *Mǎtú* after it, then *Mǎtú* is *Suí*.")

The above sixty hexagrams are all cited from *Xīxī’s Exposition of the Yì*, with the *Shì* hexagram supplemented from the *Chūjīng*.

*Yínghuò*
*Qílǎo*
*Dàmíng* (Luo Ping’s *Lùshǐ Zhù* states: "The hexagrams of the *Guīcáng Chūjīng* all have six positions, including names such as *Míngyí*, *Yínghuò*, *Qílǎo*, and *Dàmíng*. In ancient times, Qi of Xià divined *Míngyí*; Gǔn, in managing the waters, cast lots with *Dàmíng*; Jié divined *Yínghuò*; and King Wǔ, in his campaign against Shāng, cast lots with *Qílǎo*." Note: *Míngyí* cited in *Xīxī* is the same *Míngyí*. Below *Qián*, the *Shì* hexagram should be added, as supplemented from *Gān Bǎo* and *Zhū Zhèn*’s citations of the *Chūjīng*. Together with *Yínghuò*, *Qílǎo*, and *Dàmíng*, they precisely complete the sixty-four hexagrams. Following the interpretations of Messrs. Huang and Zhu, only *Shìkè*, *Bì*, and *Zhōngfú* remain unassigned; their affiliations are appended here.)

Zhu Yuansheng’s *Sānyì Bèikǎo* states: "The *Guīcáng Yì* pairs the sixty-four hexagrams with the sixty *jiǎ* stems, storing the *qi* of the Five Phases and employing the domains of the Five Phases."
He also says: "The *Guīcáng Yì* begins with *Kūn* and ends with *Bō*."
Further: "The two sections of the *Guīcáng* span from *jiǎzǐ* to *guǐsì* as the *Former Jiǎ*, and from *jiǎwǔ* to *guǐhài* as the *Latter Jiǎ*, totaling ten thousand and eight hundred *cè*."

**The Twelve Sovereign Hexagrams**
*Zǐ*: *Fù*
*Chǒu*: *Lín*
*Yín*: *Tài*
*Mǎo*: *Dàzhuàng*
*Chén*: *Guài*
*Sì*: *Qián*
*Wǔ*: *Gòu* (Zhu Taishi says: "The original text of the *Guīcáng* writes this as ◎ (upper *tuàn*, lower *chuò*).")
*Wèi*: *Dùn*
*Shēn*: *Pǐ*
*Yǒu*: *Guān*
*Xū*: *Bō* (Zhu Taishi says: "The original text of the *Guīcáng* writes this as *Pū*.")
*Hài*: *Kūn* (from Xu Shan’s *Sìyì*)

Xu Shan says: "These are the twelve sovereign hexagrams of the *Guīcáng*, known as the *Shāng* method of divination. *Sovereign* refers to the ruler. The method is as follows: First, set a six-line *Kūn* hexagram, then sequentially transform it with six yang lines to form the five sovereign hexagrams *Fù*, *Lín*, *Tài*, *Dàzhuàng*, and *Guài*. Next, set a six-line *Qián* hexagram and sequentially transform it with six yin lines to form the five sovereign hexagrams *Gòu*, *Dùn*, *Pǐ*, *Guān*, and *Bō*. With these ten sovereign hexagrams established, the framework is complete. Then, set another six-line *Kūn* hexagram and transform it with the *Fù* sovereign to produce six hexagrams with one yang line; with the *Lín* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with two yang lines; with the *Tài* sovereign, twenty hexagrams with three yang lines; with the *Dàzhuàng* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with four yang lines; and with the *Guài* sovereign, six hexagrams with five yang lines. Proceeding further to pure *Qián*, the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams is thus determined. Examining this process, the six positions of *Qián* have already become newly transformed lines, while the six positions of *Kūn* remain as the original untransformed lines—just as the yang lines in a hexagram have changed while the yin lines remain unchanged. Then, set the newly formed *Qián* hexagram and transform it with the *Gòu* sovereign to produce six hexagrams with one yin line; with the *Dùn* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with two yin lines; with the *Pǐ* sovereign, twenty hexagrams with three yin lines; with the *Guān* sovereign, fifteen hexagrams with four yin lines; and with the *Bō* sovereign, six hexagrams with five yin lines. Proceeding further to the six positions of pure *Kūn*, the transformation is complete. Ultimately, there is no dual arrangement—only these sixty-four positions. Proceeding sequentially, through seven transformations of *Kūn*, one obtains one hundred ninety-two yang lines, revealing the body of pure *Kūn*. Reversing the process, through seven transformations of *Qián*, one obtains one hundred ninety-one yin lines, again revealing the body of pure *Kūn*. One inversion and one reversal complete the three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Yì*."

**Guīcáng Qímǔjīng**
The meaning of "*Qímǔ*" is unclear. According to the *Guīcáng*, which takes *Kūn* as its beginning, *Kūn* is the mother of all things. Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* also cites the *Zhèngmǔjīng*, suggesting that the twelve sovereign hexagrams may correspond to the twelve terrestrial branches, though this is uncertain.

*Qú*: There is *qú* and *gū*; millet is brewed into wine, offered in two vessels, and two ewes drink from them. After three days, they revive.
"A knight has a marsh; I take its fish."
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Ěryǎ*, under "Sheep" in the "Beasts" section, cites the *Guīcáng*: "two vessels, two ewes." Xing Bing’s annotation states: "This is the line text of the *Qú* hexagram from the *Guīcáng Qímǔjīng*." However, upon examining the passage, it appears Xing Bing’s attribution may be incorrect. The *Xīxī Yìshuō* cites the *Guīcáng* as including a hexagram named *Qú*, and this is its line text.)

**Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng**
*Míngyí* states: In ancient times, Qǐ of Xià divined: "Riding a flying dragon to ascend to heaven," and cast lots with Gāoyáo, who said: "Auspicious."
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* cites the *Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng*: "Qǐ of Xià divined riding a flying dragon to ascend to heaven; it was auspicious.")

**Collation Notes:**
Zhang Hua’s *Bówùzhì* (vol. 9, "Miscellaneous Sayings I") cites the passage beginning with "Míngyí states: In ancient times" and the twelve characters "而枚占于皋陶陶曰," with "御" written as "乘" and an additional "而" after "龙." The *Taiping Yùlǎn* (vol. 929) quotes the *Guīcáng*: "In ancient times, Qǐ of Xià ascended as a flying dragon to reach heaven; Gāoyáo divined it and said, 'Auspicious.'" Though the wording differs slightly, it is essentially a remnant of this passage and is thus supplemented here.

In ancient times, Xià Qǐ divined the relocation of the Nine Tripods, and indeed he moved them.
(The *Bówùzhì* (vol. 9, "Miscellaneous Sayings I") cites this alongside the previous passage as a single section, followed by four additional entries, likely forming one continuous text; thus, it is appended here.)

In ancient times, Shùn divined his ascent to heaven to become a spirit; the divination by lot involved the Yellow Dragon Spirit, who said: "Inauspicious."
(Ibid.)

King Wǔ divined the campaign against Zhòu; the divination by lot involved the elders, who said: "Auspicious."
(Ibid.)

In ancient times, Gǔn divined the damming of the floodwaters; the divination by lot involved Dàmíng, who said: "Inauspicious. There will be a beginning but no end."
(Ibid.)

In ancient times, Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: "Inauspicious. It is unfavorable to march forth; only in remaining at rest is there advantage. They are the fox; we are the rat. Do not undertake action, lest you harm your father."
(The *Taiping Yùlǎn* (vol. 82) quotes the *Guīcáng*: "In ancient times, Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: 'Inauspicious. It is unfavorable to march forth; only in remaining at rest is there advantage. They are the fox; [we are] the rat.'" The two characters "为我" are omitted. The *Taiping Yùlǎn* (vol. 912) also quotes: "In ancient times, Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: 'Inauspicious. They are the fox; we are the rat. Do not undertake action, lest you harm your father.'" Wáng’s *Hàn Yìwénzhì Kǎo* combines these into one passage, which is followed here. The *Bówùzhì* cites: "Jié divined the campaign against Táng; the divination by lot involved Yínghuò, who said: 'Inauspicious,'" omitting the line text, likely an abridgment.)

In ancient times, Yì was skilled in archery; he shot down the ten suns, and indeed he did so.
(Guō Pú’s commentary on the *Shānhǎi Jīng* cites the *Guīcáng Zhèngmǔjīng*. The *Shàngshū* ("Five Sons’ Lament") *Zhèngyì* and the *Chūnqiū Zuǒzhuàn* (Duke Xiāng 4th year) *Yì* both quote the *Guīcáng*: "Yì shot down the suns.")

**Appendix of Lost Line Texts:**
Xú Shàn’s *Sì Yì* states that the *Guīcáng* contains 384 line texts, matching the six lines per hexagram of the *Zhōu Yì*, and thus belongs to the canonical text. The transmitted commentaries cite only the *Qímǔ* and *Zhèngmǔ* versions; the identifiable passages have been assigned to these two works. Those citing only hexagram names or lacking clarity are not forcibly attributed and are appended here under "Lost Line Texts" for distinction.

**Kūn Kāi divination:**
Emperor Yáo bestowed his two daughters as consorts to Shùn.
(*Zhōulǐ*, "Spring Office," "Grand Diviner," Jiǎ Gōngyàn’s subcommentary)

**Zhūn:**
"Zhūn gāo."

*The Xīxī Yì Shuō* states: "Comparing the *Zhōu Yì* with the *Guīcáng* today, not only are the hexagram names of the Shang dynasty used, but the hexagram statements also follow the Shang *Yì*. Examples include *Zhūn*’s ‘*Zhūn gāo*’, *Shī*’s ‘*shuài shī*’, *Jiàn*’s ‘*qǔ nǚ*’, and *Guī Mèi*’s ‘*chéng kuāng*’, all of which employ the original text of the Shang *Yì*."

**Shī:**
"*Shuài shī*."

(*Xīxī Yì Shuō*)

**Xiǎo Xù:**
"Its husband."

(Zhū Zhèn’s *Hàn Shàng Yì Zhuàn Cóng Shuō*, citing *Guīcáng Xiǎo Xù*)

**Dǐng:**
"The *dǐng* has yellow ears; it is advantageous to catch *zhān* and carp."

(Ōuyáng Xún’s *Yì Wén Lèi Jù*, juàn 99)

**Pū:**
"The good man obtains its jade; the petty man obtains its grain."

(*Tài Píng Yù Lǎn*, juàn 840, cites this as *Bō*. Mǎ Sù’s *Yì Shǐ*, juàn 14, cites it as "The noble man obtains its grain.")

**Jié:**
"The Yin king rules his state, ever without [acting] like the valley."

(*Zhōulǐ*, "Spring Office," "Grand Diviner," Jiǎ Gōngyàn’s subcommentary, citing the *Guīcáng*: "See the *Jié* hexagram." Luō Píng’s *Lù Shǐ Zhù* cites it as "Ever without [acting] like the valley moon.")

**Guī Mèi:**
"*Chéng kuāng*."

(*Xīxī Yì Shuō*)

**Jiàn:**
"*Qǔ nǚ*."

(Ibid.)

**Míng Yí:**
"Drooping its wings."

(Ibid.)

The above line statements with identifiable hexagram names follow the hexagram sequence as arranged in *Xīxī Yì Shuō*. For those cited from the *Chū Qián*—"Its contentious words," from the *Chū Kūn*—"The radiant flowers," from the *Chū Gèn*—"The yelping fox," from the *Chū Duì*—"Its speech is sincere," from the *Chū Luò*—"For celebration, the body remains unmoved," from the *Chū Lí*—"Lí shines brightly," from the *Chū Lí*—"Resounding like thunder’s roar," and from the *Chū Xùn*—"A bird approaches with drooping wings"—though all bear hexagram names, they uniformly begin with "Chū" and are thus included in the *Chū Jīng*. These are not repeated here. The following are those without identifiable hexagram names:

White clouds emerge from Cāngwú and enter Dàliáng.

(*Běitáng Shūchāo*, juàn 150 by Yú Shìnán; *Chūxué Jì*, juàn 1 by Xú Jiān; *Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 20, Lǐ Shàn’s commentary on Xiè Yuánhūi’s *New Pavilion Islet: Parting with Fàn Línglíng*)

Though there be stalks of *fēnglóng*:
They form nodes when meeting cloud-qi.

(*Běitáng Shūchāo*, juàn 150)

The *qián* is a zither of piled stones and wind-cavern holes.

(*Běitáng Shūchāo*)

There are wild ducks and mandarin ducks,
There are geese and *sùshuāng*.

(*Yìwén Lèijù*, juàn 92; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 925; *Hànzhì Kǎo*, juàn 1)

Someone is coming,
Leaving me cowrie shells.
When given, it is removed;
When sought, it is obtained.
Joy is about to arrive.

(*Yìwén Lèijù*, juàn 84; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 87)

The nobleman is wary of chariots,
The petty man is wary of foot travel.

(*Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 20, Liú Yánnián’s *Poem of Qiū Hú’s Wife*, annotation; *Yùhǎi*, juàn 35 by Wáng Yīnglín)

Someone is coming,
Leaving me wealth and coin,
Gazing toward it through the night.

(*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 835)

*Guī Cáng*, "Original Milfoil" chapter.

The milfoil reaches two thousand years with three hundred stalks, its root aged, thus knowing good and bad fortune. (*Bówù Zhì*)

When the tip of the milfoil is larger than its root, it is most auspicious; when the tip of the mugwort is larger than its root, it is next auspicious; when the tip of the thorn is larger than its root, it is next auspicious; when the tip of the arrow-bamboo is larger than its root, it is next auspicious; when the tip of the bamboo is larger than its root, it is next auspicious.

The milfoil governs one of the five spirits; the mugwort, two of the four spirits; the thorn, two of the three spirits; the arrow-bamboo, four of the two spirits; the bamboo, five of the one spirit.

In divination, if all five transgressions are concealed, and the five milfoils are cast, the spirits all gather there. (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 727, citing *Guī Cáng*; according to *Bówù Zhì*: "When the milfoil’s tip is larger than its root, it is most auspicious; next the mugwort, then the thorn, all being so"—this is likely an abbreviated passage. Zhu the Grand Historian’s *Jīngyì Kǎo* states: "This should belong to the *Original Milfoil* chapter." Here, both sources are used for supplementation.)

For divination, one must bathe, fast, abstain, and consume incense; each day, one gazes toward the milfoil and bathes it—this must be done five times. Bathing the tortoise is the same. (*Bówù Zhì*, juàn 9)

(*Guī Cáng*, *Shǐ Shì* chapter)

Gazing upon the heavens above, now bright, now dim.
There was Xi He’s child, who emerged from Yang Valley. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)

Gong Gong had a human face, a serpent’s body, and crimson hair. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu; *Lù Shǐ* commentary by Luo Ping, both citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)

The child of Li Mountain had green feathers, a human face, and a horse’s body. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*; *Lù Shǐ* commentary by Luo Ping cites the opening line as: “The child of Li Mountain drums.”)

The Feathered People had the form of birds: beaks, red eyes, and white heads. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)

The child of Metal and Water was named Yu Meng. When divined, it was said: “The Feathered People give birth to the hundred birds.” (*Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 13, commentary on Mi Heng’s *Rhapsody on the Parrot*, citing *Guī Cáng Yīn Shì*; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 914, cites *Qǐ Shì*, adding four characters: “and then went to the Feathered People.”)

The surging floodwaters knew no bounds; Bo Gun then used *xi shi* and *xi rang* to dam the deluge. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)

When Gun departed, his body did not decay for three years. When split open with a Wu blade, he transformed into a yellow bear. (Ibid.)

The great Wu blade of Tai Fu was used to give birth to Yu. (*Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 22)

Of old, the *Nine Darks* shared the same palace sequence as the *Disputation* of the Thearch, and this was called the *Nine Songs*. (*Shānhǎi Jīng* commentary by Guo Pu, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*)

One must not steal the *Disputation* and the *Nine Songs* to rule the world below. (Ibid.)

Of old, Xia Hou Qi offered sacrifices to the spirits at the ruins of Jin, constructing the Xuan Terrace on the sunny side of the waters. (*Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 46, commentary on Wang Rong’s *Preface to the Third Day of the Third Month’s Winding Waters Poetry*; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 82, citing *Guī Cáng Qǐ Shì*; juàn 177 cites it as “the numinous terrace of Jin,” omitting “of old” and “on the sunny side of the waters.”)

Of old, Xia Hou Qi divined and offered sacrifices to the spirits at Da Ling, ascending the Hook Terrace. Gao Yao cast the milfoil and said: “Inauspicious.” (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 82; *Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 22, cites up to “Hook Terrace.”)

Fragments transmitted in various records without identifiable chapter names are appended below.

Qian represents Heaven, the ruler, the father, great redness, the sovereign, the minister, the horse, grain, and the hexagram of blood. (Zhu Zhen’s *Yì Cóng Shuō*; Luo Ping’s *Lù Shǐ* commentary)

When the Green Thearch arose, green clouds supported the sun; when the Red Thearch arose, yellow clouds supported the moon. (Dong Jun, Yun Zhong. Sima Zhen’s *Shǐ Jì Suǒ Yǐn* states: “Dong Jun and Yun Zhong appear in the *Guī Cáng Yì*.”)

Of old, Nü Wa divined and stretched a cloud canopy. Casting the milfoil, it was said: “Auspicious. Radiant are the nine provinces, as the sun and moon alternate in their courses. Equalizing the land, harmonizing the four states.” (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 78; *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo*, juàn 1)

Of old, the Yellow Thearch battled the Flame Deity in the wilds of Zhuolu. Before the fight, he divined with Wu Xian, who said: “Fruitful indeed, yet there will be misfortune.” (*Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 79; *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo* cites: “The Yellow Thearch, before battle, divined with Wu Xian”; Luo Ping’s *Lù Shǐ* commentary cites: “Of old, the Yellow Deity fought the Flame Thearch at Zhuolu.”)

Chi You attacked Kong Sang, the dwelling of the Thearch. (Luo Ping’s *Lù Shǐ* commentary)

Chi You emerged from the Yang Waters, with eight arms, eight toes, and a sparse-haired head. He ascended the nine marshes to attack Kong Sang. The Yellow Thearch killed him at Qing Qiu and composed the *Ten Chapters of the Gang Drum*: first, *Thunder’s Shocking Tremor*; second, *Fierce Tiger’s Fright*; third, *Raptor’s Strike*; fourth, *Dragon Steed’s Prance*; fifth, *Spiritual Kui’s Roar*; sixth, *Eagle and Owl’s Strife*; seventh, *Valiant Warrior’s Might*; eighth, *Bear and Grizzly’s Howl*; ninth, *Stone’s Tumbling Cliff*; tenth, *Wave’s Surging Gorge*. (*Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 9, cites from “Chi You” to “Qing Qiu”; Feng Weina’s *Shī Jì* includes the *Ten Chapters of the Gang Drum* and onward.)

Of old, Chang E fled to the moon with the elixir of immortality. (*Wén Xuǎn*, juàn 13, commentary on Xie Huilian’s *Rhapsody on the Moon*; *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 984; *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo* cites: “Of old, Chang E consumed the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West and fled to the moon, becoming the moon’s essence.”)

Of old, the River Earl divined and fought with Luo. Casting the milfoil, Kun Wu divined it as inauspicious.

*The Chū Xué Jì*, juàn 20:
King Mu hunted in the wilds of Ge.

*The Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 831, cites *The Shangshu’s Return to the Hidden* (the characters “Shangshu” are erroneous):
Of old, King Mu’s son divined with milfoil before Yuqiang.

*Zhuāngzǐ Shìwén* and *Hàn Yì Wén Zhì Kǎo*, juàn 1:
Of old, King Mu of Heaven divined his westward departure by the proper path. The omen was inauspicious, and he said:
“The dragon descends from heaven, and the road is long and distant.
Soaring to pierce the sky, its feathers deep and dark.”

*The Tàipíng Yùlǎn*, juàn 85.

**Assorted Discourses of Various Masters**
*The Lǐjì*:
Confucius said, “I wished to observe the Way of Yin, and so I went to Song, but there was insufficient evidence. What I obtained was *Kun* and *Qian*.”

*The Shānhǎi Jīng*:
The Yellow Emperor obtained *The Yellow River Chart*, and the men of Shang followed it, calling it *Return to the Hidden*.

*The Zhōulǐ: Grand Diviner*:
He presides over the methods of the Three Changes: first, *Continuous Mountains*; second, *Return to the Hidden*; third, *The Zhou Changes*. Their primary hexagrams are eight, and their derived hexagrams are sixty-four.

Du Zichun said:
*Return to the Hidden* belongs to the Yellow Emperor.

Huan Tan said:
*Return to the Hidden* consists of 4,300 words.
He also said:
*Return to the Hidden* was stored in the Grand Diviner’s archives.

Zheng Kangcheng said:
The Yin book of yin and yang that survives is *Return to the Hidden*.

Chunyu Jun said:
*Return to the Hidden* means that the myriad things all return and are stored within.

Ruan Xiaoxu said:
*Return to the Hidden* contains miscellaneous matters on divination.

Liu Xie said:
The classic of *Return to the Hidden* greatly illuminates the strange and wondrous, even recounting Yi’s slaying of the ten suns and Chang E’s flight to the moon.

*The Suíshū*:
*Return to the Hidden* was already lost. According to the Jin *Central Catalogue*, it existed, but it only recorded divination and did not resemble the intent of the sages.

Kong Yingda said:
*Return to the Hidden* originated with the Yellow Emperor.
He also said:
The sages adapted to the times and circumstances, not necessarily following one another. Thus, the order of hexagrams in *Return to the Hidden* differs greatly.
He also said:
Confucius said, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*.” The Yin *Changes* begins with *Kun*, placing it before *Qian*.

Jia Gongyan said:
This *Return to the Hidden Changes* begins with pure *Kun*. *Kun* is earth, and the myriad things all return and are stored within it.
He also said:
The Yin took the twelfth month as the first month, following the earthly mandate, and thus placed *Kun* first.

Yuan Zhen said:
Mu Jiang encountered *Gen*, which confirms the text of the historians. The Master obtained *Kun*, also following the first hexagram of *Return to the Hidden*.

Li Shi said:
According to *The Penetration of Qian*, “He who hangs down the royal divining stalks” refers to Fuxi, who already used the yarrow stalks to form doubled hexagrams. Yet in that age, the people were simple and the customs pure, so the method only used seven and eight. The sixty-four hexagrams all remained unmoving—*Qian* stopped at *Qian*, *Kun* at *Kun*—unable to change. The Xia and Shang followed this, all using seven and eight for divination; *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* are examples. Later ages grew decadent, and only then did they begin to use nine and six for divination, for without this, it would not suffice to respond to the changes of the world.

Liu Chang said:
*Kun* is where the myriad things return. The Shang placed *Kun* first. *The Evolution of Rites* says, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*,” referring to the *Changes* of *Return to the Hidden*.

Xing Bing said:
*Return to the Hidden* was composed by Cheng Tang and is one of the Three *Changes*.

Ouyang Xiu said:
By the end of the Zhou, the *Changes* of Xia and Shang were already lost. Though *Return to the Hidden* existed in the early Han, it was no longer the ancient classic. Today, the three extant chapters cannot be thoroughly examined.

Shao Zi said:
The Shang took the month of *jianchou* as the first month, calling it the earthly mandate. The *Changes* is called *Return to the Hidden*, beginning with *Kun*. *Kun* is earth.

Fang Que said:
*Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*, each returning to its root, concealing its use. These were the practices of the Yin, aligning with the earth’s seasons. The Yin used the earthly mandate, hence the name of the book.

Huang Shang said:
The subtle and manifest are the knowledge of the *Changes*. Thus, the Shang called it *Return to the Hidden*. *Return to the Hidden* refers to its concealment of all uses.

Wang Guoguo said:
*The Lǐjì* records Confucius saying, “I obtained *Kun* and *Qian*.” Zheng’s commentary states: “He obtained the Yin book of yin and yang; the surviving text is *Return to the Hidden*.”
*The Ěryǎ: Explanation of Sheep* lists “male sheep,” and Guo Pu’s commentary cites *Return to the Hidden*: “Two gourds, two rams.”
*The Chū Xué Jì: Clouds* cites *Return to the Hidden*: “A white cloud emerges from Cangwu and enters Daliang.” This can be seen.
*The Revival Catalogue*:
*Return to the Hidden*—in the Sui era, there were thirteen chapters. Today, only *The Initial Classic*, *The Mother of Milfoil*, and *The Origin of Yarrow* remain. The text is largely fragmented and disordered, impossible to interpret.

Wu Hang said:
*The Zhōulǐ* states: “The Grand Diviner presides over the Three *Changes*: *Continuous Mountains*, *Return to the Hidden*, and *The Zhou Changes*. Their primary hexagrams are eight, and their derived hexagrams are sixty-four.” Thus, the hexagrams of *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* were already doubled in the time of the Three Sovereigns, while *The Zhou Changes* was doubled in the age of King Wen.

Wu Renjie said:
*Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* use the unchanging for divination, and their prognostication does not extend beyond the original hexagram. *The Zhou Changes* uses the unchanging for divination, but its prognostication must pass through two hexagrams. This can be verified in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.

Wei Liaoweng said:
The meaning of the Three *Changes* in *The Zhou Changes*: “Closing the door is called *Kun*”—this is *Return to the Hidden*. “Nothing is more flourishing than *Gen* in the beginning and end of the myriad things”—this is *Continuous Mountains*.

Li Gang said: *Return to the Hidden* is the Shang *Changes*, beginning with *Kun*; hence it is called *Return to the Hidden*. Confucius, observing the Shang Dao in Song, obtained *Kun Qian*, which was likely a text of *Return to the Hidden*.

Zhu Zhen said: The *Initial Classic* of *Return to the Hidden* embodies the original intent of Fuxi. It is also said: The *Three Changes* in the *Rites of Zhou* all consist of eight primary hexagrams—these primary hexagrams are the eight trigrams of the *Initial Classic*.

Zhang Xingcheng said: The Shang called it *Return to the Hidden*, the *Changes* of Earth. The meaning of *The Original Bundle* is derived from it.

Zheng E said: *Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*, the *Changes* of the Shang people. Its hexagram is *Kun* above and *Kun* below, hence it is called *Return to the Hidden*, signifying the earthly Dao’s capacity to contain and all things’ return to concealment within it.

Zheng Qiao said: *Continuous Mountains* is lost. During the Tang, Sima Ying annotated thirteen scrolls of *Return to the Hidden*, which are now also lost. In the Sui, Xue Zhen annotated thirteen scrolls, but only three sections remain today: *Initial Classic*, *Maternal Lineage of Qi*, and *Root of the Yarrow Stalk*. These discuss divination, their language is plain, and their meaning ancient. Later scholars, deeming them unrefined, cast them aside in doubt. Yet *Continuous Mountains* was lost precisely because it was even more neglected than this. How could later generations ever replicate such works?

Yang Jian said: In Confucius’ time, *Return to the Hidden* still existed, which is why it is said he “obtained *Kun Qian* in Song.”

Luo Mi said: The Yellow Emperor rectified *Kun* and *Qian*, separated *Li* and *Kan*, and based on images and numbers, adapted them to suit the needs of his era. Regarding earth as auspicious, he placed *Kun* first—this is the *Return to the Hidden Changes*. It is also said: *Return to the Hidden* is the book of the Gui Zang clan, which the Shang people adopted. It is further said: *Return to the Hidden* employs eight.

Luo Ping said: *Return to the Hidden* is the Yellow Emperor’s *Changes*, yet *Kun Qi Divination* contains phrases like “Yao bestowed his two daughters as wives to Shun,” and the *Jie* hexagram states, “The Yin king’s state will constantly suffer famine in the moon’s season.” The hexagrams are correct, but the text is not—likely composed during the Tang era as part of *Return to the Hidden*.

Lin Xuemeng said: The *Commentary on the Changes* discusses *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden*, some claiming they are the works of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, others asserting they are the *Changes* of Xia and Shang. It is unclear which is correct.

Jiang Junshi said: The Shang ordered the *Changes* with *Kun* first, from which their emphasis on simplicity and the color white in their rituals derived.

Li Guo said: The *Essentials of the Changes* states: “Heaven is noble, earth is humble—this is the fixed position of *Qian* and *Kun*.” The Shang *Changes* begins with *Kun*, implying earth is nobler than heaven. The reason the Shang *Changes* did not endure is unknown. The Shang people established *chou* as their first month, taking the opposition of *chou* and *wei* as the earthly sequence. *Kun* represents earth, and since the Shang followed the earthly sequence, they placed *Kun* first.

Wang Yinglin said: In the *Outer Transmission of the Annals of Yue*, Fan Li says: “The Dao gives birth to qi, qi gives birth to yin, and yin gives birth to yang.” I consider the precedence of yin over yang to reflect *Return to the Hidden*’s placement of *Kun* first—closing before opening, stillness before movement.

Ma Duanlin said: *Continuous Mountains* and *Return to the Hidden* are the *Changes* of Xia and Shang, predating the *Zhou Changes*. However, the *Han Records of Arts and Letters* does not list *Return to the Hidden*, nor does the *Sui Records of Classics* include *Continuous Mountains*. These two works likely emerged between the Jin and Sui dynasties. *Continuous Mountains* was a forgery by Liu Xuan, as historical records explicitly state. It is reasonable to infer that *Return to the Hidden* is of the same nature.

Ge Yinyan said: *Return to the Hidden* is the *Changes* of the Yellow Emperor’s Middle Heaven.

Jia Xuanweng said: The book *Return to the Hidden* was composed by the Yellow Emperor, and the sixty *jia* alongside the sixty-four pre-heaven hexagrams were part of the *Middle Heaven Return to the Hidden Changes*.

Zhu Yuansheng said: Though *Return to the Hidden* was created by the Yellow Emperor, it followed Fuxi’s sequence of hexagrams. The *Han Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars* states: “Fuxi drew the eight trigrams, beginning with numbers, and they were perfected by the Yellow Emperor.” Thus, Fuxi’s *Changes* and the Yellow Emperor’s *Changes* are unified in principle. It is also said: The *Rites of Zhou*’s *Grand Diviner* “presides over the methods of the Three *Changes*,” and the *Diviner* “presides over the Three *Changes* to distinguish the nine types of divination.” It never discarded *Return to the Hidden* in favor of the *Zhou Changes*. In the ninth year of Duke Xiang of Lu, Mu Jiang divined and encountered *Gen* changing to eight. Du Yu explained: “This mixed the use of *Continuous Mountains*, *Return to the Hidden*, and the *Zhou Changes*.” From this, we see that *Return to the Hidden* remained intact during the Spring and Autumn period. It is further said: *Return to the Hidden* follows the model of the *River Chart*. Since the *River Chart*’s ten is incomplete, *Return to the Hidden* omits ten. Wu Cheng said: *Return to the Hidden* is the *Changes* of the Shang. It is also said: The *Changes* of Xia and Shang likely employed the hexagrams drawn by Fuxi for divination, though their sequence differed from the natural order of pre-heaven hexagrams. Thus, *Continuous Mountains* begins with *Gen*, and *Return to the Hidden* begins with *Kun*.

Wu Lai said: *Return to the Hidden* in three scrolls, annotated by Xue Zhen of the Jin, now appears sporadically in other works, resembling Jiao Gong’s *Forest of Changes*—not the ancient *Changes*.

Zhao Daoyi said: The Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, adopted Fuxi’s hexagram images and applied them, basing them on Shennong’s emphasis on the sixty-four hexagrams. The Emperor then expounded on the eight trigrams, calling them the “Eight Searches,” seeking the meaning of the doubled hexagrams.

The Emperor titled himself "Guicang Shi" and named his work the *Guicang* (*Return to the Hidden*)—this was the beginning of the *Changes*. Zhu Yinlao said: The *Guicang* is the *Changes* of the Yellow Emperor, beginning with *Kun*; all who established the *chou* (the second Earthly Branch) took it as their model, not only the people of Yin. Zhu Sheng said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, the origin of stillness and movement. Ding Yidong said: The Xia called it *Lianshan*, the Shang called it *Guicang*; though they differ in beginning with *Gen* or *Kun*, both take the lower hexagram as the *zhen* (primary) and the upper as the *hui* (regret). Thus, the *Hongfan* of Jizi speaks only of divining with the two. He Qiaoxin said: The *Sui Dynasty’s “Record of Classics and Books”* includes a *Guicang* in thirteen scrolls, presented by Liu Guangbo, though its content is shallow and vulgar. Though the book is no longer extant, the *Changes*’ notion of *Kun* concealing things preserves the lingering intent of the *Guicang*. He Mengchun said: The Yin *Changes* places *Kun* before *Qian*, for stillness precedes movement—this is the fixed principle of yin and yang. Yang Shen said: The *Lianshan* was stored in the Orchid Terrace, and the *Guicang* in the Grand Diviner’s archives, as seen in Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*. Thus, in the Later Han, both the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* still existed; one should not doubt their authenticity merely because the *Art and Literature Annals* omits them. Hu Yinglin said: The *Seven Summaries* does not include the *Guicang*, but the *Central Catalog* first records it, and the *Sui Annals* follows, calling it a book “concerned only with divination, unlike the intent of the sages.” By the Tang, it was already suspected of being a forgery. Zheng Yuanxi said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, concealing before manifesting. Confucius said, “I wished to observe the Way of Shang and found *Kun* and *Qian* there,” praising it. Yet it is narrow compared to the *Changes*. Shen Maoxiao said: The Shang *Changes* begins with *Kun* to conceal and gather, then sets in motion the mechanism of direct action. Hao Jing said: The *Guicang*’s *Kun* hexagram represents Earth; the myriad beings return to the soil, hence the name *Guicang* (*Return to the Hidden*). Jiao Hong said: The *Guicang* is *Kun*; scholars of the Shang era prioritized stillness. Dong Sizhang said: The *Guicang Changes* is now lost, surviving only in the names of sixty-four hexagrams, four of which are missing, differing from the *Zhou Changes*. Sun Qifeng said: The *Guicang* begins with *Kun*, which conceals. Worldly affairs are not exhausted by manifestation but by concealment; if retreat and concealment are not secure, vitality withers, leading to daily desiccation. Thus, concealment is nurturance, and the primal power of *Kun* sustains life. Xu Shan said: The *Guicang* has been lost for a long time. Some seek it in the *Ancient Three Tombs* or the works of Sima Ying and Xue Zhen—these are erroneous. Others mistakenly identify books on *guihun* (returning spirits) or *najia* (heavenly stems) as the *Guicang*—these are crude. Still others misinterpret the phrase “*Qian* rules, *Kun* conceals” and claim the square diagram is the *Guicang*—this is forced. As for Wei Shi’s reckless fabrications, they are outright reckless. Zhu Yizun said: According to records, the *Guicang* still existed in the Sui, and by the Song, it retained three chapters: *Initial Classic*, *Mother of Qi*, and *Root of the Milfoil*. The passages cited in commentaries are archaic and profound. Yet Kong Yingda’s *Correct Meaning* dismisses the *Guicang* as a fraudulent work—this is not entirely justified. As for the *Three Tombs Book*, which classifies the *Guicang Changes* as the *Qi Tomb*, its hexagram and trigram images state: “The qi of Heaven returns, the qi of Earth conceals, the qi of Wood generates, the qi of Wind moves, the qi of Fire grows, the qi of Water nurtures, the qi of Mountain halts, the qi of Metal kills,” each with its own commentary. This differs greatly from the passages cited in traditional commentaries. Ma Su said: The *Rites of Zhou* states that the Grand Scribe oversees the three *Changes*. Later scholars identified the *Guicang* as the name of the Yin *Changes*; its oracle phrases, as cited in various texts, are ancient and unadorned.

The Qin bamboo slip version of the *Guicang*—the *Guicang* from Qin Tomb No. 15 at Wangjiatai, Jiangling—includes 164 numbered bamboo slips and 230 unnumbered fragments, totaling 394 slips with approximately 4,000 characters. Due to severe damage, no complete slip has been reconstructed, and their sequence remains undetermined. Among these slips, there are seventy sets of hexagram drawings, sixteen of which are duplicates. Excluding duplicates, fifty-four distinct hexagram drawings remain. All hexagrams use “一” for yang lines and “∧” for yin lines. There are seventy-six hexagram names, twenty-three of which are repeated, yielding fifty-three unique names. Some hexagram phrases are also duplicated. The slips come in two types: one wide and thin, the other narrow and thick. Thus, we infer that this batch of *Guicang* includes two different copies. The hexagram drawings in the Qin slips all correspond to those in the received *Zhou Changes*, and most hexagram names align with transmitted versions of the *Guicang*, the Mawangdui silk *Zhou Changes*, and the received *Zhou Changes*. Below are selected transcriptions (primarily from the beginnings of slips; duplicates are transcribed once unless their hexagram drawings or names complement each other, in which case all are included). The transcriptions roughly follow the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams in Ma Guohan’s *Jade Case Mountain Studio Collection of Lost Books*. The numbers below are the original cleaning numbers, while those above are provisional sequence numbers.

Here is the translation:

*The Guīcáng* (Compilation from *Complete Literature of High Antiquity, the Three Dynasties, Qin, Han, Three Kingdoms, and Six Dynasties*)
Edited by Yán Kějūn of the Qing Dynasty

*Guīcáng* – A Cautious Note:
Du Zichun’s commentary on the *Rites of Zhou* states: "The *Guīcáng* pertains to the Yellow Emperor."
*Imperial Digest* (609) cites *Annals of Emperors and Kings*: "The people of Yin inherited the Yellow Emperor’s *Guīcáng*."
The *Record of Rites – Evolution of Rites* reads: "I obtained *Kūn* and *Qián*," to which Zheng Xuan remarks: "The extant text is the *Guīcáng*."
The *Subcommentary* quotes Xiong Ansheng: "The Yin *Changes* takes *Kūn* as its beginning, thus placing *Kūn* before *Qián*."
The *Sui Bibliography* and both the Old and New *Tang Bibliographies* list: "*Guīcáng*, thirteen scrolls."
The *Sui Bibliography* further states: "The *Guīcáng* was already lost by the early Han. The Jin *Central Catalog* included it, though it contained only divination and omens, unlike the intent of the sages. As the original hexagrams remained, it was appended to the beginning of the *Zhou Changes* to supplement the missing Yin *Changes*."
According to *Imperial Digest* (608), citing Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*: "The *Guīcáng* consists of 4,300 characters," indicating that the text existed by the late Western Han. The *Han Bibliography*, based on the *Seven Summaries*, merely omitted it by chance.
*Comprehensive Examination of Literature* cites the *General Catalog of Chongwen*: "Today, only the *Initial Classic*, *Maternal Qi*, and *Root Achillea* chapters remain."
*Jade Sea* cites the *Book Catalog of the Revival* to the same effect.
The *Catalog of the Wenyuan Pavilion* does not record it, suggesting that the three chapters were lost between the Yuan and Ming dynasties.
Now, gathering fragments from various texts, 846 characters have been recovered—roughly one-twelfth of the version Huan Tan saw.

In ancient times, the Yellow Spirit and the Flame Spirit contended at the fields of Zhuolu. Before battle, they divined through Wu Xian, who declared: "Fruitful indeed, yet with misfortune."
(*Imperial Digest* 79; *Records of Antiquity – Former Annals* 3, *Latter Annals* 4)

In ancient times, Feng Long divined about the clouds and qi, and it was auspicious.
(*Northern Hall Book Excerpts* 150)
Note: In old manuscripts, the latter half of each entry is often omitted, replaced with "之也" throughout.
The commentary to *Biography of King Mu* (2) states: "Feng Long divined about driving the clouds, obtaining the hexagram *Great Strength*, and thus became the Master of Clouds." This likely derives from the *Guīcáng*.
Chen Yumo’s edition reads: "Though there were stalks of Feng Long, they obtained cloud qi and formed nodes," a conjectural emendation without basis.

In ancient times, the River Earl divined about battling the Luo, casting lots for interpretation. Kunwu interpreted it as inauspicious.
(*Primary Learning Record* 20)

In ancient times, Chang'e consumed the immortal elixir of the Queen Mother of the West and fled to the moon, becoming the moon’s spirit.
(*Northern Hall Book Excerpts* 150, *Wen Xuan* commentary on *Moon Rhapsody*, *Eulogy for the Noble Consort*, *Eulogy for Yan Guanglu*, *Imperial Digest* 984)

Yi requested the immortal elixir from the Queen Mother of the West, but Heng'e stole it and fled to the moon. Before departing, she divined with milfoil at Youhuang. Youhuang interpreted it, saying: "Auspicious. Graceful is the Returning Maiden, journeying alone to the west. Though you meet the heavens’ gloom and darkness, do not be startled or afraid—later, you shall greatly prosper."
(Zhang Heng’s *Spiritual Constitution*, cited in the commentary to *Later Han Astronomy Treatise* 1; likely a passage from the *Guīcáng*)

Gun divined with the *Guīcáng* and obtained the hexagram *Great Brilliance*, which read: "Inauspicious. There is a beginning but no end."
(*Lu History: Later Annals* 13)

In ancient times, King Qi of Xia offered sacrifices to the spirits at the ruins of Jin, constructing the Xuan Terrace on the sunny side of the waters.
(*Literary Collection* 62, *Wen Xuan* commentary on Wang Rong’s *Preface to the Winding Water Poems*, *Primary Learning Record* 24, *Imperial Digest* 177)

King Qi of Xia divined about offering sacrifices to the spirits at Mount Daling and ascending the Hook Terrace. Gaoyao interpreted the milfoil, saying: "Inauspicious."
(*Northern Hall Book Excerpts* 82, *Primary Learning Record* 24, *Imperial Digest* 82)

Qi divined about relocating the Nine Tripods, and indeed he moved them.
(*Lu History: Later Annals* 14)

In ancient times, Jie divined about attacking Tang and consulted the milfoil with Mars, who said: "Inauspicious. It is not favorable to march forth, only to remain at rest. They are the badger, we are the rat—do not act, lest you harm your father."
(*Imperial Digest* 82, 912; *Lu History: Later Annals* 14)

King Wu divined about attacking Shang, and the elders interpreted the milfoil, saying: "Inauspicious."
(*Lu History: Later Annals* 5)

In ancient times, King Mu of Zhou divined about departing for the western regions, and the result was inauspicious, reading: "The dragon descends from heaven, and the road is long and distant. Though it soars and strikes the sky, its feathers are ashen."
(*Imperial Digest* 85)

King Mu hunted in the wilds of Ge.
(*Imperial Digest* 831)

In ancient times, King Mu’s son divined with milfoil before Yuqiang.
(*Zhuangzi: The Great and Venerable Teacher*, commentary; *Lu History: Later Annals* 5)

(*Rites of Zhou: Grand Diviner*, commentary; *Lu History: Explications*)

(*Imperial Digest* 840)

(*Northern Hall Book Excerpts* 158)

The noble man is wary of chariots; the petty man is wary of foot soldiers.
(*Wen Xuan*, commentary on Yan Yannian’s *Ballad of Qiu Hu*)

Above stands a high terrace; below lies a vast pool.
By this one serves their lord—so noble, it seems as if transformed;
If used for trade and commerce, so rich, it flows like a river.
(*Imperial Digest* 472)

Someone will come,
Bestowing upon me cowrie shells.
By uprightness, it is exhausted; by seeking, it is obtained.
With joy, it arrives.
(*Literary Collection* 84; *Imperial Digest* 87)

Someone will come,
Bestowing upon me wealth and coin.
From nightfall, I await them.
(*Imperial Digest* 835)

Dongjun and Yunzhong.
(*Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices*, *Suoyin* commentary: "See *Gui Cang Yi*")

*Qian* is Heaven, the lord, the father, the great crimson, the sovereign, the minister, the horse, the grain, the blood hexagram.
(*Lu History: Explications*)

Note: This appears to be a passage from the *Shuo Gua*; the Yin *Yi* already possessed it, not originating with the *Ten Wings*.

Of the twenty-five matters above, those cited without chapter titles—from "Yellow Spirit" to the divinations of "Xiahou Qi"—should belong to the *Qi Shi* chapter. Those also mentioning King Wu and King Mu were likely later additions by the Grand Diviner.
(*Northern Hall Book Excerpts* 101, citing Huan Tan’s *New Discourses*: "*Gui Cang* was stored among the Grand Diviner’s archives," hence the Yin *Yi* contains Zhou-era matters. All beyond the hexagram statements are but transmitted sayings.)

*Gui Cang*
*Qi Shi*

In the flourishing age of Taihao,
A white cloud emerged from Cangwu,
Entering Daliang.
(*Literary Collection* 1; *Wen Xuan*, commentary on Xie Tiao’s *Parting from Magistrate Fan of Lingling at Xinting Islet*; *Primary Learning* 1; *Bai Tie* 2; *Imperial Digest* 8 and 872)

Long ago, Nüwa divined with milfoil to spread the cloud canopy and cast the stalks.
The divine spirit interpreted it, saying: "Auspicious.
Radiant are the Nine Provinces, as the sun and moon take turns at their zenith.
Land is evenly apportioned; the myriad states are harmonized."
(*Northern Hall Book Excerpts* 132; *Primary Learning* 25; *Imperial Digest* 78)

Gonggong: a man’s face, a serpent’s body, crimson hair.

Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Great Wilderness West* (*Literary Collection* 17; *Imperial Digest* 78):
Chiyou emerged from the Yang Waters, eight-limbed and eight-toed, with a broad forehead. He ascended the Nine Marshes to attack Kongsang, and the Yellow Emperor slew him at Qingqiu. (*Primary Learning* 9; *Records of Antiquity: Later Annals* 4)
*Note*: *Records of Antiquity* further states: "Chiyou, broad of forehead and tiger-bellied, eight-limbed and eight-toed, as recorded in the *Gui Cang: Qi Shi*."

Gazing upon the heavens above,
Now bright, now dim.
Then came Fuxi’s son,
Issuing from Yang Valley.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Great Wilderness South*)

Emperor Yao bestowed his two daughters as wives to Shun.
(*Rites of Zhou: Grand Diviner*, subcommentary citing the *Kun Kai Shi*—*Kun* being the name of the hexagram.

The surging floodwaters,
Without end or limit,
Bo Gun then used *xishi* and *xi rang* to dam the deluge.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Classic of Regions Within the Seas*; also found in the *Records of the Grand Historian: Biography of Gan Mao*, *Suoyin* commentary)

When Gun died, his body remained uncorrupted for three years. Split open with a Wu blade, he transformed into a yellow dragon.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Classic of Regions Within the Seas*)

Gun, executed, lay dead for three years without decay. Split open with a Wu blade, he thus gave forth Yu.
(*Primary Learning* 22; *Records of Antiquity: Later Annals* 12)

The son of Mount Li, named Gu, had a human face and a horse’s body, clad in blue feathers.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Classic of the Western Mountains*; *Records of Antiquity: Later Annals* 4)
*Note*: The *Classic of the Western Mountains* further states: "The son of Zhong Mountain was named Gu, his form like a human face with a dragon’s body," with commentary noting: "All such types appear in the *Gui Cang: Qi Shi*."

The son of the Metal Waters was named Yumeng. He went to the Feathered People, and from them arose the hundred birds.
(*Wen Xuan* commentary on the *Rhapsody on the Parrot*; *Imperial Digest* 914)

The Feathered People had the form of birds: beaks, red eyes, and white heads.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Classic of Lands Beyond the Seas: South*)

Of old, those *Nine Darks*
Shared the same palace sequence with the Emperor’s *Distinctions*,
Thus becoming the *Nine Songs*.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Great Wilderness West*)

They could not steal the *Distinctions* and the *Nine Songs* to rule the world below.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Great Wilderness West*)

*Gui Cang: Zheng Mu Jing*

Of old, Yi was skilled in archery and shot down the ten suns, indeed bringing it to completion.
(*Subcommentary on the "Five Sons' Songs" of the Book of Documents*; *Subcommentary on the Zuo Tradition, Year 4 of Duke Xiang*; *Subcommentary on the Analects, "Xian Wen"*; *Subcommentary on the Mencius, "King Hui of Liang"*).
Note: Hong Xingzu’s *Supplementary Annotations to the "Heavenly Questions"* cites the *Gui Cang Yi*: “Yi shot down the ten suns,” which is an abridgement of this passage.

The Xia sovereign Qi divined and rode flying dragons to ascend to heaven; the outcome was auspicious.
(Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Classic of Lands Beyond the Seas: West*).
This makes clear that Qi, too, became an immortal.
Note: The *Subcommentary on the Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, Scroll 5, states: “Mount Songgao is where Qi’s mother transformed into stone, and her son Qi also ascended as an immortal—both are recorded in the *Gui Cang*.”
*Ming Yi* says: Of old, the Xia sovereign Qi mounted flying dragons to ascend to heaven; Gaoyao divined it and declared: “Auspicious.”
(*Imperial Digest* 929).
Note: The *Lu Shi*, *Later Annals* 14, cites the *Gui Cang Zheng Mu Jing*: “*Ming Yi* says the Xia sovereign Qi divined and rode flying dragons to ascend to heaven,” merging this with the preceding passage into a single entry.

*Gui Cang: Initial Classic*
Initial *Kun*, Initial *Qian*, Initial *Li*, Initial *Kan*, Initial *Dui*, Initial *Gen*, Initial *Zhen*, Initial *Xun*.
(*Lu Shi*, *Later Annals* 5, and *Elucidations*).
Note: The *Yu Hai*, Scroll 35, cites it as: “Initial *Qian*, Initial *Shi* (i.e., *Kun*), Initial *Gen*, Initial *Dui*, Initial *Luo* (i.e., *Kan*), Initial *Li*, Initial *Li* (i.e., *Zhen*), Initial *Xun*. All hexagrams consist of six lines. *Shi* is *Kun*, *Luo* is *Kan*, and *Li* is *Zhen*. There exists a *Gui Cang Mirror* that also writes *Shi*, *Luo*, and *Li* for these.”
*Gui Cang: Qi Mu Jing*

"Quyou, Quyous—
The *gu*-vessel and night millet brew the wine,
Vessels of paired gourds hold it high.
Two ewes drink deep,
Three days pass before they revive.

The knight has marshland,
I take its fish."

(*Erya*, "Explaining Livestock" commentary; the *Subcommentary* states: "This is a passage from the *Gui Cang Qi Mu Jing*. *Quyou* is a hexagram name.")

*Gui Cang: Root Milfoil Section*
When the milfoil’s tip exceeds its root, it is most auspicious.
When mugwort’s tip exceeds its root, it is next auspicious.
When bramble’s tip exceeds its root, it is next auspicious.
When reed’s tip exceeds its root, it is next auspicious.
When bamboo’s tip exceeds its root, it is next auspicious.

Milfoil governs one and five spirits,
Mugwort governs two and four spirits,
Bramble governs two and three spirits,
Reed governs four and two spirits,
Bamboo governs five and one spirits.

In divination, if all five transgressions are concealed,
And the five milfoil stalks are cast,
The spirits all gather there.

(*Taiping Yulan*, Scroll 727, cites the *Gui Cang* without specifying the section. The *Chongwen General Catalogue* states: "Now only the *Initial Classic*, *Qi Mu*, and *Root Milfoil* sections remain," confirming this as the *Root Milfoil Section* text.)
