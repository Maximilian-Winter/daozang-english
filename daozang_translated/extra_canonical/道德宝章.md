**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**
**Section: Masters (Subcategory 14) – Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue**
**Daoist School – Abstract**

We, your ministers, respectfully note:

*Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* (*Daode baozhang*), in one fascicle, was composed by Ge Changgeng of the Song dynasty. Changgeng, styled Baisou, was a native of Minqing in Fujian and a Daoist priest residing on Mount Wuyi. The original edition bore the title *Purple Clarity Perfected One Bai Yuchan*, for "Bai Yuchan" was his sobriquet, and "Purple Clarity Perfected One" the title conferred upon him when summoned to the imperial court during the Jiading era. His commentary follows the text with annotations, eschewing philological exegesis of characters or phrases, nor does it extensively elaborate. His glosses are often sparser than the original scripture’s passages, and their purport frequently resembles Chan gāthās—no doubt because Buddhism and Daoism share a common source.

This edition was hand-copied and engraved by Zhao Mengfu of the Yuan dynasty, its calligraphy and carving executed with exquisite precision. Chen Jiru of the Ming later reprinted it in his *Compendium of Secret Writings*, retitling it *Toad Immortal’s Explication of the Laozi*, though this diverges from the original title. Additionally, two postscripts by the Recluse of Shiyuan Residence, dated the *guiwei* year of the Wanli reign, precede the text. The first postscript cites *Dong You’s Catalogue of Collected Books*, which records Zhang Daoxiang’s *Anthology of Ancient and Modern Commentaries on the Laozi*, comprising over forty schools—yet omits this work. Now, Zhang Daoxiang was a man of the Tianbao era of the Tang; how could he have included a book from the Ningzong period of the Southern Song in his catalogue? Moreover, Zhang’s anthology lists twenty-nine schools, plus his own commentary, totaling thirty—not "over forty." The postscript’s claims appear to be hearsay.

Changgeng is traditionally regarded as an immortal. Liu Kezhuang’s collected works include a preface to *Wang Yu’s Six Studies and Nine Books*, wherein he recounts meeting four alchemists: Zou Ziyi, who did not reach seventy; Zeng Jingjian and Huang Tiangu, who barely reached sixty; and Bai Yuchan, who died young. Furthermore, Chen Zhensun’s *Book Catalogue with Abstracts* states under *Collected Pearls and Jade of the Immortals*: "Bai Yuchan, surnamed Ge, was a native of Minqing in Fuzhou. He once committed a crime and fled into exile—truly a reckless and deceitful rogue." While serving as magistrate of Nancheng, I encountered a sojourning scholar who inquired whether I had ever met this man. I replied, "How could such a person be permitted to cross my threshold?" Both accounts, contemporaneous with Changgeng, suggest that popular legends likely arose from later embellishments. However, Daoists naturally exalt their own tradition, and such tendencies are common. Since his book contains much of value, there is little need to scrutinize the man too closely.

Respectfully submitted for imperial review in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.

*Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue*
By Song [Dynasty] Ge Changgeng

**Embodying the Dao**
The Dao—
[It is thus and no more.]
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
[To speak of it is already not so.]
The Name—
[Forced designation as "Dao"]
The Name that can be named is not the eternal Name.
[To call it Dao is already not so.]

The Non-being—
[This is the Dao.]
It is called the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The Being—
[The One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, the Three generates the myriad things—thus Being arises.]
It is called the mother of the myriad things.
[The One gives birth to the myriad existences; the myriad existences return to the One.]

Thus, abide in constant Non-being
[Empty the mind, extinguish thoughts]
to observe its mysteries.
Abide in constant Being
[Preserve the center, embrace the One]
to observe its manifestations.

These two
[The myriad existences and Non-being; Non-being itself is also Non-being, yet within Non-being, Non-being does not exist]
emerge together yet bear different names.
[The myriad dharmas return to the One; the One mind is fundamentally empty.]
Together they are called the Profound.
[The Dao does not seek emptiness; emptiness naturally returns to it. When one can empty the mind, the Dao naturally returns to them.]
Profound beyond profound—
[Within emptiness, the True is concealed; from Non-being, Being arises.]
the gateway to all mysteries.
[Awakening enters here; its application is inexhaustible.]

**Nurturing Life**
When all under Heaven know the beautiful as
[Seeking to be called beautiful]
beautiful, ugliness arises.
[Failing to attain the name of beauty.]
When all know the good as
[Seeking to be called good]
good, not-good arises.
[Instead becoming evil.]

Thus, Being and Non-being give rise to one another;
Difficulty and ease complete one another;
Long and short shape one another;
[The Dao is originally formless; lengths define themselves in contrast.]
High and low incline toward one another;
[Tian revolves, Earth turns—originally without hierarchy.]
Sound and voice harmonize with one another;
[One wind stirs, the myriad pipes respond.]
Before and after follow one another.
[The ancient is the present; the present will be the ancient.]

Therefore, the sage abides in non-action
[Valuing naturalness]
and practices the teaching without words.
[The Dao is embodied in things.]
The myriad things arise yet are not rejected;
[Non-being must give rise to Being—how could it not? If it did not, how could permanence be perceived?]
They are born yet not possessed;
[Nothing is not illusory and transient.]
They act yet do not rely on it;
[Today, today—nothing more.]
Their work is accomplished yet not dwelt upon.
[How can dreams be taken as reality?]
Only because they do not dwell
[Forgetting the external yet not forgetting the internal]
do they not depart.
[The one self remains.]

**Pacifying the People**
Do not exalt worthiness—
[As a son, one should be filial; as a subject, loyal.]
so the people do not contend.
Do not prize rare goods—
[Gold and earth share the same value.]
so the people do not steal.
Do not display what is desirable—
[Between the ears and eyes, the mind truly resides.]
so the heart is not disordered.
[When it strays, call it back.]

Thus, the sage’s governance:
Empty their minds,
Fill their bellies,
Weaken their ambitions,
Strengthen their bones,
Always keep the people without knowledge and without desire.
Let those with knowledge
not dare to act.
Act through non-action—
then nothing will be ungoverned.

**The Fathomless Source**
The Dao—
Vast yet inexhaustible in use,
[Empty within]
as if it could never be filled.
[The abyss—]
Profound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
[The mind.]

Blunt its sharpness,
[Gather the spirit.]
Untangle its knots,
[Cease thoughts.]
Soften its brilliance,
[Conceal the mind within the mind, so it is not seen.]
Merge with its dust.
[Blend the mind with things.]

Limpid, it seems to endure.
[Preserve the spirit in Non-being.]
I do not know—
Whose child is it?
It seems the ancestor of the Emperor.

**The Use of Emptiness**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent—
[Without intention]
they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
[Allowing them to be as they naturally are.]
The sage is not benevolent—
[Taking the mind of Heaven and Earth as their own mind.]
they treat the hundred clans as straw dogs.
[Having already forgotten the self, how could there be anything else?]

The space between Heaven and Earth—
[The mind]
is it not like a bellows?
[Operating yet never exhausted.]
Empty yet never depleted,
[Its use is inexhaustible.]
The more it moves, the more it produces.
[Pure and unceasing.]
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
[How can it be described?]
Better to guard the center.
[Fulfill what lies within.]

**Forming the Image**
The Valley Spirit does not die—
[This mind is originally without birth or death.]
It is called the Profound Female.
[All share this one Heaven.]
The gateway of the Profound Female—
[Where the thought stirs]
is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
[Only the mind.]
Subtle, it seems to endure—
[It is merely thus.]
Its use is effortless.
[Non-action—nothing more.]

**Concealing Brilliance**
Heaven is eternal, Earth enduring.
[Abiding in non-action.]
The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring
[The mind is also thus]
is that they do not live for themselves.
[This mind is ever-present.]
Thus, they can live long.
[Originally without birth or death.]

Therefore, the sage—
[I]
places the self behind yet finds the self ahead;
[Present everywhere.]
sets the self aside yet finds the self preserved.
[Thus it has always been.]
Is it not because they are without self-interest?
[Heaven and Earth share the same root with me; the myriad things share the same body with me.]
Thus, they can fulfill their self-interest.
[I am Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are me.]

**Easing Nature**
The highest good is like water—
[Nature is like water.]
Water is good—
[It does not contend with things—nothing more.]
Benefiting the myriad things yet not contending,
[What intention did it originally have?]
Dwelling where the multitude abhor,
[What does it have to do with me?]
thus it is close to the Dao.
[The mind is also thus.]

In dwelling, be good at the ground;
In the mind, be good at the abyss;
In giving, be good at benevolence;
In speech, be good at sincerity;
In governance, be good at rectitude;
In service, be good at ability;
In action, be good at timing.
Only by not contending—
[The square inch does not compete]
does one avoid fault.
[Nor is it taken as fortune.]

**Harmonizing the Vulgar**
Hold it and fill it—
[Without lack or excess]
better to stop.
[Release body and mind.]
Sharpen it to a point—
[Value desireless non-action]
it cannot be preserved long.
When gold and jade fill the hall,
[Frugal in seeing, frugal in hearing—yet still in surplus]
none can guard it.
When wealth and nobility breed arrogance,
[Quiet the mind, do not employ it]
one invites one’s own misfortune.
When merit is achieved and fame attained,
[When the moon reaches the heart of Heaven, when the wind comes to the water’s surface]
withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven.
[Retreat to leave room.]

**Chapter on Capacity**

Embrace the soul and spirit—
[Pacify the heart]
Hold fast to the One.
Can you never part from it?
[Where would it go, where would it come from?]
Concentrate qi to attain suppleness—
[Pure clarity, utterly still]
Can you be like an infant?
[Utterly undivided]
Purify and empty profound vision—
[No affairs in the heart, no heart in affairs]
Can you be without flaw?
[Body and mind as one]
Cherish the people, govern the state—
[Nurture spirit, cultivate qi]
Can you practice non-action?
[No thought, no doing, no deliberation, no worry]
The gates of Heaven open and close—
[The mind’s ground, luminous and clear]
Can you remain receptive?
[One and not two]
Illumined, penetrating the four directions—
[Principle illumines things like ice melting, the moon shining]
Can you be without knowledge?
[All day like the fool]
Give life, nurture life—
[One heart holds all, enfolds the ten thousand images]
Give life yet do not possess,
Act yet do not rely,
Lead yet do not dominate—
[Vast, without self]
This is called profound virtue.

---

**Chapter on Uselessness**

Thirty spokes converge on a single hub—
[Like the thirty days of a month]
Together they form one wheel.
[One month is thus]
Where there is nothing—
[The moon’s waxing and waning]
There lies the use of the cart.
[Though the moon wanes, it still completes a month]
Mold clay to make a vessel—
[Yin and yang flow to create transformation]
Where there is nothing—
[Heaven and Earth have no perfect work, the sage has no perfect ability]
There lies the use of the vessel.
[Even with gaps, Heaven’s work is manifest]
Cut doors and windows to make a room—
[The ten thousand images, luxuriant, share one Heaven]
Where there is nothing—
[Spirit does not guard the house, the five senses lose their defense]
There lies the use of the room.
[Sage and fool share the same nature, forgetting within to pursue without]
Thus, what exists is for benefit,
What does not exist is for use.
[Receive this body from father and mother for use;
Preserve the original nature shared by all—without within.]

---

**Chapter on Restraining Desire**

The five colors—
[Green, yellow, red, white, black]
Make the eyes blind.
[The mechanism lies in the eye, the mind’s direction]
The five tones—
[Gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu]
Make the ears deaf.
[Coveting externals, neglecting internals]
The five flavors—
[Sweet, pungent, salty, sour, bitter]
Make the mouth lose its taste.
[Forgetting its natural state]
Racing and hunting—
[Monkey-mind, horse-qi]
Make the heart go mad.
[Unsettled body and mind, no place to return]
Rare and precious goods—
[What use are gold and jade?]
Hinder conduct.
[What is treasured is the heart; guard the One]
Thus the sage acts for the belly—
[His joy is within]
Not for the eyes.
[Ears follow sound, eyes are deceived by color]
Therefore, abandon that and take this.

---

**Chapter on Disdaining Shame**

Favor and disgrace both bring alarm—
[No glory, no shame—this heart is serene]
Value great trouble as you do the body.
[Anticipate trouble, guard against it]
What is meant by “favor and disgrace bring alarm”?
Disgrace is lowly—
[What people despise]
Gaining it brings alarm,
Losing it brings alarm.
[If it is not mine to possess,
Even a hair’s breadth is not to be taken]
This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace bring alarm.”
[What have they to do with me?]
What is meant by “value great trouble as you do the body”?
The reason I have great trouble—
[The heart’s unease, the body’s unrest]
Is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body—
[Utterly one with Heaven, I am not even I]
What trouble could I have?
[Forget self, forget the world—Heaven’s truth, natural]
Thus, one who values the body for the sake of the world—
[The heart is like the ruler, the body like the world]
May be entrusted with the world.
One who cherishes the body for the sake of the world—
[To govern the body is like governing the state]
May be relied upon for the world.
[Can endure long without loss]

---

**Chapter on Praising the Profound**

Look and it cannot be seen—it is called *yi*.
[The heart within the body]
Listen and it cannot be heard—it is called *xi*.
[The nature within the heart]
Grasp and it cannot be held—it is called *wei*.
[The spirit within nature]
These three cannot be further questioned—
[Cannot be spoken, only guarded]
Thus they merge into one.
Its rising is not bright,
Its sinking is not dark.
Unceasing, unnameable—
[From ancient times to now, shining alone, enduring]
It returns to nothingness.
[See things and you see the heart]
This is called the formless form,
The imageless image—
[The heart has no shape,
Nature has no form—one version reads “the imageless image”]
This is called the indistinct and evanescent.
[The spirit has no coming or going]
Meet it and you do not see its head,
Follow it and you do not see its rear.
Hold to the ancient Dao—
[Originally no perfection]
To master present being.
[Originally no life or death]
To know the ancient beginning—
[Ancient is now, now is ancient—let it be from ancient to now]
This is called the thread of the Dao.

---

**Chapter on Manifesting Virtue**

The ancients who were good as scholars—
[Illuminating the heart, seeing nature]
Were subtly profound, mysteriously penetrating.
[Holding fast to the center]
Deep, beyond recognition.
[My Dao is one that pervades all—cannot be heard]
Only because they were beyond recognition,
I force myself to describe them:
Cautious, as if crossing a river in winter,
Hesitant, as if fearing neighbors on all sides,
Dignified, as if a guest,
Yielding, as ice about to melt,
Simple, as uncarved wood,
Vast, as a valley,
Turbid, as muddy water.
Who can make the turbid clear through stillness?
Who can bring forth life through calm?
Those who preserve this Dao—
[The Dao is not to be cultivated, only kept from defilement]
Do not desire fullness.
Only because they are not full,
They can remain hidden,
Not newly completed.

**Returning to the Root**

To the utmost emptiness,
Hold fast to stillness.
The ten thousand things arise together—
I thereby observe their return.
All things flourish,
Each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
Stillness is called returning to life.
Returning to life is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called clarity.
Not knowing constancy—
Reckless action invites calamity.
Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing;
All-embracing, one is impartial;
Impartial, one is kingly;
Kingly, one is of heaven;
Of heaven, one is of the Dao;
Of the Dao, one is enduring.
Though the body perish, never in danger.

**The Fading of Pure Custom**

In the highest antiquity,
People knew it was there.
Next, they drew near and praised it.
Next, they feared it.
Next, they scorned it.
Where trust is insufficient,
Distrust arises.
How careful they were in their words!
When tasks were accomplished and affairs completed,
The people all said, “We are naturally thus.”

**The Decay of Custom**

When the great Dao declined,
Benevolence and righteousness arose.
Wisdom and cunning emerged—
Great hypocrisy followed.
The six relations fell out of harmony—
Filial piety and kindness appeared.
The state fell into chaos and confusion—
Loyal ministers arose.

**Returning to Simplicity**

Cut off sageliness,
Abandon wisdom—
The people benefit a hundredfold.
Cut off benevolence,
Abandon righteousness—
The people return to filial piety and kindness.
Cut off skill,
Abandon profit—
Thieves and robbers disappear.
These three,
As mere adornments, are not enough.
Thus let there be something to which they belong:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce self-interest, diminish desires.

**Different from Custom**

Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow.
How much difference is there between “yes” and “ah”?
How far apart are good and evil?
What people fear,
One cannot but fear.
Yet how boundless it seems, unending!
The multitude are joyous,
As if feasting on the great sacrifice,
As if ascending the terrace in spring.
I alone am tranquil, without sign,
Like an infant who has not yet smiled,
Listless, as if with nowhere to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
While I alone seem lacking.
I have the heart of a fool—
So muddled!
The common people are bright,
I alone am dim.
The common people are sharp,
I alone am dull.
Vast, like the sea,
Ceaseless, as if without end.
The multitude all have their use,
While I alone am stubborn and crude.
I alone differ from others,
Yet I value being fed by the Mother.

**Chapter on the Hollow Heart**

The bearing of great virtue
Follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
Is but dim, is but vague.
Vague, dim—
Yet within it there are images.
Dim, vague—
Yet within it there are forms.
Deep, obscure—
Yet within it there is essence.
Its essence is most true,
Within it there is trust.
From ancient times to now,
Its name has never departed,
By which we behold the origin of all things.
How do I know the origin of all things?
By this.

**Chapter on Increasing Humility**

To bend is to be whole,
To twist is to be straight,
To hollow is to be filled,
To wear out is to be renewed,
To have little is to gain,
To have much is to be confused.
Therefore the sage embraces the One
And becomes the model for all under heaven.
Not displaying oneself, one is seen clearly;
Not asserting oneself, one is distinguished;
Not boasting, one achieves merit;
Not priding oneself, one endures.
It is only because one does not contend
That none under heaven can contend with one.
The ancient saying, “To bend is to be whole”—
Is it empty words?
Truly, to be whole is to return to it.

**Chapter on Emptiness and Nothingness**

Sparse words are natural.
A whirlwind does not last the morning,
A sudden rain does not last the day.
Who makes these? Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot last long,
How much less can man?
Thus, those who align with the Dao
Are one with the Dao.
Those who align with virtue
Are one with virtue.
Those who align with loss
Are one with loss.
One with the Dao, the Dao also embraces them;
One with virtue, virtue also embraces them;
One with loss, loss also embraces them.
When trust is insufficient,
There is distrust.

**Chapter on Bitter Kindness**

Those who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm,
Those who stride do not walk.
Those who display themselves are not seen clearly,
Those who assert themselves are not distinguished,
Those who boast achieve no merit,
Those who pride themselves do not endure.
In the Dao, these are called
“Leftover food and superfluous actions,”
Which some things detest.
Thus, those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.

**Chapter on the Origin of Images**

There is a thing, formless yet complete,
Born before heaven and earth.
Silent, empty—
Standing alone, unchanging,
Circling endlessly, never exhausted,
It may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
I do not know its name;
I style it “Dao.”
Forced to name it, I call it “Great.”
Great means passing,
Passing means far-reaching,
Far-reaching means returning.
Thus the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
And the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
Earth models itself on heaven,
Heaven models itself on the Dao,
The Dao models itself on nature.

**Chapter on Weight and Virtue**

Weight is the root of lightness,
Stillness is the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the sage,
Though traveling all day,
Does not part from the heavy supply wagon.
Though there are glorious sights,
He remains detached, transcendent.
How can the lord of ten thousand chariots
Treat his person lightly before all under heaven?
If he is light, he loses his ministers;
If he is restless, he loses his throne.

**Chapter on Skillful Use**

Good traveling leaves no tracks,
Good speech has no flaws,
Good reckoning uses no tally.
Good closure needs no bolt yet cannot be opened,
Good binding needs no rope yet cannot be undone.
Thus the sage
Is always good at saving people,
And so abandons no one;
Always good at saving things,
And so abandons nothing.
This is called inheriting clarity.
Therefore the good person
Is the teacher of the not-good,
And the not-good person
Is the resource of the good.
Not to value one’s teacher,
Not to cherish one’s resource—
Though wise, one is greatly deluded.
This is called the essential mystery.

**Chapter on Returning to Simplicity**

Know its yang—**the spirit**—
Guard its yin—**the nature**—
To be the world’s stream,
To be the world’s stream—**profound and wondrous**.
Virtue ever constant does not depart,
Returning to the state of infancy—**thoughtless**.

Know its brightness—**the nature**—
Guard its darkness—**the destiny**—
To be the world’s model—**emptiness merging with the formless, wholly yielding to softness**,
To be the world’s model—**all perceptions, awareness, and knowledge utterly still**.
Virtue ever constant knows no flaw,
Returning to the boundless.

Know its glory—**the heart**—
Guard its disgrace—**the self**—
To be the world’s valley—**only emptiness of all that is may be embraced; nothing may be imposed upon the void**,
To be the world’s valley—**hollow within**.
Virtue ever constant is thus fulfilled,
Returning to simplicity—**the Great Primal, the boundless**.
When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels—**the Supreme Ultimate arises, and the Two Modes emerge**.
The sage employs it—**knowing this principle**—
And thus becomes a leader—**as if in awe**.
Therefore, great governance is uncut—**the heart is one with emptiness; emptiness is not the heart**.

---

**Chapter on Non-Action**

Those who would seize all under heaven and act upon it—
I see they cannot succeed—**the Dao is fundamentally non-action**.
All under heaven is a sacred vessel—**the dwelling of the heart**—
It cannot be acted upon—**no doing, no ceasing, no grasping, no extinguishing**.
Those who act upon it ruin it,
Those who grasp it lose it—**the foolish chase externals, the wise cling to internals; the sage transcends both. I, too, am no sage**.

Thus, some things advance, others follow—**mind fixed upon this**;
Some breathe gently, others blow—**thoughts without deviation**;
Some are strong, others weak—**skillful use of the heart**;
Some bear, others destroy—**profound contemplation of this principle**.
Therefore, the sage—**the self**—
Abandons excess—**too much is as bad as too little**,
Abandons extravagance—**the Dao is ever thus**,
Abandons excessiveness—**the Dao is never lacking**.

---

**Chapter on Frugality and Warfare**

One who assists a ruler with the Dao—**the Dao unites with the heart**—
Does not use arms to dominate all under heaven—**excelling in victory through non-contention**.
Such affairs readily return—**returning to the root, restoring destiny**.
Where armies encamp—**where the heart’s warfare arises**—
Thorns and brambles grow—**the heart is disturbed, the spirit wild**.
In the wake of great armies—**the heart races with things, affairs contend with the mind**—
There must be inauspicious years—**essence and desire driven, spirit and qi depleted**.

Thus, the skillful achieve their aim—**through the power of concentration**—
Yet dare not seize strength—**merely forgetting the self**.
Achieving their aim, they do not boast—**waiting in stillness**,
Achieving their aim, they do not vaunt—**guarding in silence**,
Achieving their aim, they are not arrogant—**preserving harmony**,
Achieving their aim, it is only when unavoidable—**employing emptiness**.
This is achieving one’s aim without force—**emptiness and spontaneity**.
When things grow strong, they age—**the heart is swayed by things**—
This is called not following the Dao—**nature obscured by the heart**.
Not following the Dao, they perish early—**the spirit stifled by nature**.

---

**Chapter on Laying Down Arms**

Fine weapons are inauspicious tools—**using the heart to overcome things ultimately fails**—
Some things detest them—**lured by things**.
Thus, those with the Dao do not dwell in them.
Therefore, the noble person at rest values the left—**forgetting the heart**—
In warfare, values the right—**relying on the true**.
Weapons are inauspicious tools—**only when unavoidable are they used**—
Not the tools of the noble person—**meeting challenges without contention, affairs pass, the heart remains serene**.
Only when unavoidable are they used—**seeking to align with the Dao, yet failing to align**—
Serenity is supreme—**tranquil**.
Victory is not celebrated—**concentrating desire, the spirit does not concentrate**.
Those who celebrate it—**focusing the will without distraction, the spirit coalesces**—
Delight in killing—**eliminating desire**.
Those who delight in killing—**utterly detached**—
Cannot achieve their will in all under heaven.

Thus, auspicious affairs honor the left—**do not follow the heart’s lead**—
Inauspicious affairs honor the right—**let the heart be the master**.
The deputy general stands on the left—**diminishing the heart**—
The supreme general stands on the right—**preserving the spirit**.
This is to handle them with mourning rites—**as if guarding one’s parents**.
When the slain are many—**the six thieves’ armies stilled, the three-foot flame unburning, the root’s multitude**—
Mourn them with sorrowful tears—**the heart dies, the spirit remains**.
When victorious in battle, handle it with mourning rites—**the solitary light shines alone**.

---

**Chapter on Sagely Virtue**

The Dao is ever nameless.
Though simplicity is small—**yet vast**—
All under heaven dare not treat it as a subject.
If lords and kings can guard it—**guarding the One**—
The ten thousand things will naturally submit—**the heart as master, things as guests**.
Heaven and earth unite—**body and heart as one**—
To send down sweet dew—**the Great Dao attained**.
The people, without command, naturally harmonize—**the heart unburdened, the body at ease; the heart non-active, the spirit naturally transforms**.

At the beginning, systems create names—**the Dao**.
Once names exist—**the heart**—
One must also know when to stop—**nature**.
Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril—**the spirit**.
The Dao’s presence in all under heaven—**the heart within me**—
Is like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas—**the ten thousand things return to the One, returning to the One alone**.

---

**Chapter on Discerning Virtue**

One who knows others is wise—**not turned by things**—
One who knows oneself is enlightened—**the heart uniting with the Dao**.
One who overcomes others has strength—**long abiding in the Dao, transformation naturally occurs**—
One who overcomes oneself is mighty—**true accumulation of power endures**.
One who knows contentment is rich—**what thing is not the Dao?**
One who acts with determination has resolve—**where there is resolve, affairs are accomplished**.
One who does not lose their place endures—**nature ever present**.
One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived—**the spirit does not perish**.

---

**Chapter on Accomplishing Tasks**

The Great Dao flows—**the heart without direction**—
It may be left or right—**utterly without knowledge**.
The ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse—**the Great Dao does not give life, yet life cannot escape it; the myriad transformations self-generate, the Great Dao does not give life**.
Its work accomplished, it does not claim possession—**truly, nothing is gained**.
It nurtures the ten thousand things—**the Dao can foster things**—
Yet does not act as their master—**forgetting its origin**.
Thus, it is ever without desire—**yet does not act as master**—
And may be called small—**though the Dao is small, it pervades the ten thousand things**.
The ten thousand things return to it—**when one can empty the heart, the Dao naturally returns**—
Yet it does not act as their master—**if even the self is not seen, what can be possessed?**
And may be called great—**what does it not contain?**
Therefore, the sage—**the heart**—
Never acts as great—**a grain holds worlds, a mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru**—
And thus can accomplish greatness—**the buddhas’ dharma-body enters my nature; my nature unites with the Tathāgata**.

**Chapter on Benevolent Virtue**
Grasping the great image—**the world comes to it**—
Coming yet unharmed—**the Dao knows no spirits, moves alone, arrives alone**—
Secure, peaceful, and stable—**when the heart is at peace, nature is level; when nature is level, spirit is at ease**.
Delight and bait—**following the heart without transgressing bounds**—
Passing travelers halt—**wayward thoughts naturally cease**.
The Dao emerges from the mouth—**bland yet flavorful**—
So faint it seems flavorless—**the flavor of flavorlessness**.
Gazing, it cannot be seen—**the Dao has no form**—
Listening, it cannot be heard—**the Dao has no sound**—
Its use is inexhaustible—**the Dao is without end**.

**Chapter on Subtle Clarity**
Desiring to contract it—**gathering the heart**—
One must first expand it—**forgetting things**.
Desiring to weaken it—**forgetting speech**—
One must first strengthen it—**forgetting the self**.
Desiring to abolish it—**forgetting the heart**—
One must first establish it—**forgetting nature**.
Desiring to seize it—**forgetting spirit**—
One must first bestow it—**forgetting the Dao**.
This is called subtle illumination—**forgetting what is gained**.
The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong—**roaming the heart among things without being confined by them**.
Fish cannot leave the depths—**the heart does not depart from the Dao**.
The state’s sharpest instruments—**heavenly principle remains firm**—
Cannot be shown to others—**human desires naturally exhaust themselves**.

**Chapter on Governance**
The Dao is ever non-action—**its use is inexhaustible**—
Yet nothing is left undone—**what can it not accomplish?**
If lords and kings can hold to it—**the heart arises from the Dao**—
The ten thousand things will transform themselves—**all transformations are natural**.
When transformation stirs desire—**a single thought arises**—
I will suppress it with nameless simplicity—**knowing the true unity where the six senses cease**.
Nameless simplicity—**the Dao is ever non-action**—
Will also not desire—**yet nothing is left undone**.
The world will right itself—**body and heart as one; the original true self settles into stillness**.

**Chapter on Virtue**
Highest virtue is not virtuous—**without attachment**—
Thus it possesses virtue—**not claiming possession of what it has**.
Lesser virtue does not lose virtue—**bound and obstructed**—
Thus it lacks virtue—**incompatible with the Dao**.
Highest virtue acts without acting—**nothing to engage the heart**—
And has no purpose in acting—**what is there to do?**
Lesser virtue acts—**pursuing delusion, losing truth**—
And has purpose in acting—**the Dao cannot be acted upon**.
Highest benevolence acts—**uniting the heart with the Dao**—
Yet has no purpose in acting—**still and unmoving**.
Highest righteousness acts—**taking things as the heart, obscuring what is seen**—
And has purpose in acting—**flowing without return**.
Highest ritual acts—**the Dao follows nature**—
Yet none respond to it—**far removed from the Dao**—
Then they roll up their sleeves and drag others—**self-obscuring their heaven**.
Thus, losing the Dao, then virtue—**unable to spiritually master spirit**—
Losing virtue, then benevolence—**unable to naturally master nature**—
Losing benevolence, then righteousness—**unable to master the heart with the heart**—
Losing righteousness, then ritual—**already lost their truth**.
Ritual is the thinness of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos—**no longer natural**.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of foolishness—**knowing cannot be known**.
Thus, the great man dwells in thickness, not thinness—**returning to simplicity, reverting to the uncarved**—
Abides in reality, not its blossoms—**withdrawing sight, returning hearing**.
Therefore, he rejects that and takes this—**turning the light inward, reflecting**.

**Chapter on the Root of the Law**
Of old, those who attained the One—**who am I?**
Heaven attained the One and became clear—
Earth attained the One and became tranquil—
Spirits attained the One and became numinous—
Valleys attained the One and became full—
The ten thousand things attained the One and came to life—
Lords and kings attained the One and became the world’s standard—
Their attainment was the same—**of old, those who attained the One**.
Without heaven’s clarity, it would fear splitting—**heaven follows the Dao**—
Without earth’s tranquility, it would fear erupting—**earth follows heaven**—
Without spirits’ numinosity, they would fear vanishing—**the Dao follows nature**—
Without valleys’ fullness, they would fear drying—**the Dao is simply One**—
Without the ten thousand things’ life, they would fear perishing—**thus, reject that and take this**—
Without lords and kings’ standard, exalted and lofty, they would fear stumbling—**the One, unmoving; the ten thousand transformations, natural**.
Thus, nobility takes lowliness as its root—**spirit is the foundation of nature**—
Loftiness takes lowness as its base—**nature is the root of the heart**.
Therefore, lords and kings—**the heart**—
Call themselves orphaned, widowed, and barren—**no use for their use**.
Is this not taking lowliness as their root?—**only the Dao as their body**.
Is it not?—
Thus, attaining many carriages is no carriage—**no self**.
Do not desire to gleam like jade—**not possessing what one has**—
Or clatter like stone—**preserving wholeness, originally clattering**.

**Chapter on Rejecting Use**
Reversion is the movement of the Dao—**preserving spirit with nature**—
Weakness is the function of the Dao—**preserving nature with the heart**.
The world’s things are born from being—**preserving the heart with the self, originally things as the ten thousand things**—
Being is born from non-being—**preserving the self with no-self**.

**Chapter on Sameness and Difference**
The highest scholar hears the Dao—**eagerly practices it**—**like a handless man desiring to box**.
The middling scholar hears the Dao—**as if present, as if absent**—**a mute dreaming**.
The lowest scholar hears the Dao—**laughs greatly at it**—**the common people use it daily yet do not know**.
Without laughter, it would not suffice as the Dao—**thus, established words say**:
Illuminating the Dao seems dim—**not dimming the original**—
Advancing the Dao seems retreating—**diminishing daily in the pursuit of the Dao**—
Leveling the Dao seems uneven—**not generating distinctions**—
Highest virtue seems like a valley—**embracing the ten thousand transformations**—
Great whiteness seems tarnished—**greatness contains all**—
Vast virtue seems insufficient—**fearing it is not enough**—
Established virtue seems lazy—**constantly bearing this thought, one illumination, one application**—
True substance seems altered—**not taking oneself as I**—
Great squares have no corners—**spirit has no direction**—
Great vessels are late in completion—**the Dao is born before the ten thousand things yet completed after them**—
Great sounds are rarely heard—**nothing to perceive**—
Great images have no form—**nothing to name or describe**—
The Dao is hidden, without name—**nothing to say**.
Only the Dao—**excels at lending and completing**—**able to transform transformations without self-transformation**.

**Chapter on the Transformations of the Dao**

The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang; through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.

What people despise are only "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy," yet kings and lords take these as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet gain, or gain yet diminish.

What others teach, I also teach: "There is neither One nor Two." The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural end, for they cannot reach the state of no-self. I shall take this as the father of all teachings.

---

**Chapter on Universal Application**

The softest under heaven (the Dao) gallops through the hardest (things and self). That which has no form enters where there is no gap. Thus I know the benefit of non-action. Few in the world can attain this: the many are clear and bright, while I alone am dull and obscure.

---

**Chapter on Establishing Precepts**

Which is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Therefore, excessive love incurs great cost; hoarding wealth leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. Thus one may endure long.

---

**Chapter on Vast Virtue**

Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless. Great straightness seems bent; great skill seems clumsy; great eloquence seems inarticulate. Movement overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and stillness set the world right.

---

**Chapter on Moderating Desires**

When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields. When the world loses the Dao, battle steeds are bred in the suburbs. No crime is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than discontent; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, knowing contentment’s sufficiency is ever sufficient.

---

**Chapter on Discerning Afar**

Without stepping outside, one knows the world; without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Therefore, the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, and accomplishes without acting.

---

**Chapter on Forgetting Knowledge**

Pursuing learning increases daily; pursuing the Dao decreases daily. Decrease and again decrease, until one reaches non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone. Thus, to govern the world, one must be without affairs. If affairs arise, one is unfit to govern the world.

---

**Chapter on Embracing Virtue**

The sage has no fixed heart but takes the hearts of the people as his heart. The good, I treat as good; the not-good, I also treat as good—thus attaining goodness. The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—thus attaining trust. The sage, in the world, is unassuming, blending his heart with the world. The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.

---

**Chapter on Valuing Life**

Emerging into life, entering into death: thirteen are the companions of life; thirteen are the companions of death. Why is this? Because of the thickness of life’s nurturing.

It is said that those who skillfully nourish life do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers on land, nor are they harmed by weapons in battle. The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn; the tiger finds nowhere to sink its claws; weapons find nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they have no place of death.

---

**Chapter on Cultivating Virtue**

The Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them; things shape them; circumstances complete them. Therefore, the ten thousand things all honor the Dao and value virtue. The honor of the Dao and the value of virtue arise not by command but by constant spontaneity.

Thus, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, rears and raises them, completes and matures them, nourishes and shelters them. It creates yet does not possess; acts yet does not rely; leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.

**Chapter on Returning to the Profound**

The world has a beginning—this is the Mother of all under heaven. Having attained the Mother, one knows Her children. Having known the children, one returns to guard the Mother. Though the body perish, there is no danger.

Seal the apertures, close the gates—throughout life, there is no toil. Open the apertures, meddle in affairs—throughout life, there is no salvation. Perceiving the small is called clarity; guarding softness is called strength. Employing one’s light, returning to clarity—no calamity befalls the self. This is called practicing the constant.

**Chapter on Increasing Evidence**

Were I to possess even a little knowledge, I would walk the great Dao—yet I fear only straying from it. The great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways.

The court is excessively adorned; the fields are overgrown with weeds; the granaries are utterly empty. They wear embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth—these are called thieves and boasters. Such is not the Dao!

**Chapter on Cultivating Observation**

Those who skillfully establish do not uproot; those who skillfully embrace do not lose. Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate it in the self—its virtue becomes genuine. Cultivate it in the family—its virtue becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the village—its virtue becomes enduring. Cultivate it in the state—its virtue becomes bountiful. Cultivate it in the world—its virtue becomes universal.

Thus, observe the self through the self; observe the family through the family; observe the village through the village; observe the state through the state; observe the world through the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this.

**Chapter on the Profound Correspondence**

Profound virtue is deep—it is like an infant. Poisonous insects do not sting it; fierce beasts do not seize it; birds of prey do not strike it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grasp is firm. It knows not the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of its essence. It cries all day without its throat growing hoarse—such is the perfection of its harmony.

Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Augmenting life is called auspicious; the mind directing qi is called strength. When things grow strong, they age—this is called not-Dao. What is not-Dao perishes early.

**Chapter on Profound Virtue**

Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.

Seal the apertures, close the gates; blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots; harmonize the light, merge with the dust—this is called profound union.

Thus, it cannot be made near, nor can it be made distant; it cannot be benefited, nor can it be harmed; it cannot be honored, nor can it be debased. Therefore, it is precious under heaven.

**Chapter on Pure Transformation**

Govern the state with uprightness; deploy troops with strategy; take the world with non-action. How do I know this is so? By this.

The more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the people become. The more sharp tools people possess, the more benighted the state grows. The more skill and cunning people have, the more strange things arise. The more laws and decrees are proclaimed, the more thieves and bandits appear.

Therefore, the sage says: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.

**Chapter on Following Transformation**

When governance is dull, the people are simple; when governance is exacting, the people are lacking.

Disaster—where fortune leans; fortune—where disaster lurks. Who knows their limit? There is no constant standard. The normal reverts to the strange; the good reverts to the ominous. The people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.

Thus, the sage is square but does not cut; is sharp but does not pierce; is straight but does not stretch; is bright but does not dazzle.

**Chapter on Guarding the Dao**

In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. For frugality is to be early in compliance. Being early in compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue. With the repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome. Having overcome all, none can fathom its limit. None can fathom its limit, and thus one may possess the state. Possessing the state’s mother, one may endure long. This is called deep roots and firm foundation—the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

**Chapter on Occupying Position**

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish. When the Dao is applied to the world, its demons lose their numinosity. Not that its demons lose their numinosity, but their numinosity no longer harms people. Not that their numinosity no longer harms people, but the sage also does not harm people. As neither harms the other, virtue converges upon them both.

**Chapter on Humble Virtue**

A great state is the lower reaches of a river, the confluence of all under Heaven, the female of the world. The female always overcomes the male through stillness, and stillness is to be below. Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state. When a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state. Therefore, some humble themselves to win, while others humble themselves and win. A great state desires only to gather and nurture people; a small state desires only to enter and serve others. When both obtain what they desire, the greater should remain below.

**Chapter on the Dao’s Function**

The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, the treasure of the good, and the refuge of the not-good. Fine words can be traded in the marketplace; noble conduct can be bestowed upon others. Why then abandon those who are not good? Thus, when the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed, though one may offer jade discs followed by teams of horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao. Why was this Dao so valued in ancient times? Did they not say that by seeking, one obtains, and by having faults, one is exempted? Thus, it is treasured by all under Heaven.

**Chapter on the Origin of Grace**

Practice non-action; attend to non-affairs; savor the tasteless. Whether great or small, many or few, repay enmity with virtue. Plan for difficulty while it is easy; act on the great while it is small. The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy; the great affairs of the world must arise from the small. Therefore, the sage never strives for greatness and thus accomplishes greatness. One who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted; one who takes things lightly will encounter many difficulties. Therefore, the sage treats all as difficult and thus never encounters difficulty.

**Chapter on Guarding Against**

What is secure is easy to maintain; what shows

**Chapter on Putting Oneself Last**

The reason rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys is that they excel in staying low. Thus, they become kings of all valleys. Therefore, when the sage wishes to be above the people, he must speak humbly; when he wishes to lead the people, he must put himself behind. Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands ahead, the people do not find him harmful. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without wearying. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.

**Chapter on the Three Treasures**

All under Heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unlike anything. Precisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything. If it resembled anything, it would long since have been small. I possess three treasures that I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion; the second is frugality; the third is not daring to be first in the world. Through compassion, one can be courageous; through frugality, one can be expansive; by not daring to be first in the world, one can become the vessel of leadership. Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, abandons frugality yet seeks expansiveness, abandons the last yet seeks the first, this is death. For compassion, when used in battle, brings victory; when used in defense, it brings firmness. Heaven will save such a one, guarding him with compassion.

**Chapter on Matching Heaven**

The skilled warrior is not martial; the adept in battle is not enraged; the master of victory does not contend; the one who excels in employing others places himself below. This is called the virtue of non-contention; this is called the power of employing others; this is called matching Heaven—the ultimate of antiquity.

**Chapter on the Mysterious Use**

There is a saying in the use of arms: "I dare not act as host but act as guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot." This is called marching without marching, raising the arm without raising it, confronting the enemy without confronting, wielding weapons without wielding them. No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy endangers my treasures. Thus, when evenly matched armies clash, the side that grieves will prevail.

**Chapter on Knowing Difficulty**

My words are very easy to know and very easy to practice, yet none in the world can know or practice them. Words have their origin; affairs have their master. It is only through ignorance that they do not know me. Those who know me are rare; thus, I am esteemed. Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

**Chapter on Knowing Illness**

To know yet seem not to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is illness. Only by recognizing illness as illness can one avoid illness. The sage is without illness because he recognizes illness as illness; thus, he is without illness.

**Chapter on Loving Oneself**

When the people do not fear authority, great authority will arrive. Do not constrict their dwelling; do not stifle their livelihood. Only by not stifling them will they not be stifled. Therefore, the sage knows himself but does not display his knowledge; loves himself but does not exalt himself. Thus, he discards the latter and embraces the former.

**Chapter on Acting Without Force**

Courage in daring leads to death; courage in not daring leads to life. Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm. Who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion? Thus, even the sage finds this difficult. The Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory; does not speak yet excels in response; is not summoned yet comes of itself; is unhurried yet excels in planning. Heaven’s net is vast and wide; though its mesh is coarse, nothing slips through.

**Chapter on Controlling Delusion**

The people do not fear death—why threaten them with it? If the people always feared death, and I could seize and kill those who act strangely, who would dare? There is always an executioner who kills. To kill in place of the executioner is like hewing in place of the master carpenter. Few who hew in place of the master carpenter do not injure their own hands.

**Chapter on Avarice and Harm**

The people suffer hunger—
because their superiors consume too much in taxes.
This is why they hunger.

The people are difficult to govern—
because their superiors act with excessive effort.
This is why they are difficult to govern.

The people treat death lightly—
because they pursue life with such intensity.
This is why they treat death lightly.

Only those who do not make life their aim
are wiser than those who prize life.

**Chapter on Warning Against Force**

When people are born, they are soft and weak;
when they die, they are stiff and strong.
All things—plants and trees—are soft and fragile in life;
when they die, they are withered and dry.
Thus, the stiff and strong are companions of death;
the soft and weak are companions of life.
Therefore, when weapons are strong, they do not prevail;
when the root is strong, it breaks.
The strong and great dwell below;
the soft and weak dwell above.

**Chapter on the Dao of Heaven**

The Dao of Heaven—
is it not like the drawing of a bow?
What is high is pressed down;
what is low is raised up.
What has excess is diminished;
what is deficient is replenished.
The Dao of Heaven
diminishes excess to supplement deficiency.
The Dao of Man is not so—
it diminishes the deficient to serve the excess.
Who can take their excess and offer it to the world?
Only those who possess the Dao.
Thus, the sage acts without relying on it,
accomplishes without dwelling in it,
and does not desire to display worth.

**Chapter on Trust and Reliance**

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.
Nothing can replace it.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard;
the weak overcomes the strong.
There is none in the world who does not know this,
yet none can practice it.
Therefore, the sage says:
To bear the nation’s disgrace
is to be called the lord of the altars of soil and grain.
To bear the nation’s misfortune
is to be called the king of all under Heaven.
Straightforward words seem paradoxical.

**Chapter on Holding the Contract**

When great resentment is reconciled,
some resentment necessarily remains.
How can this be considered good?
Thus, the sage holds the left half of the contract
but does not demand payment from others.
Those with virtue oversee the contract;
those without virtue oversee exactions.
The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality—
it always aligns with the good.

**Chapter on Independence**

Let the state be small, its people few.
Let there be tools enough for tens or hundreds,
yet let them not be used.
Let the people regard death as weighty
and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
none will ride them.
Though there be armor and weapons,
none will display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping.
Let them savor their food,
admire their clothing,
feel at ease in their dwellings,
and delight in their customs.
Neighboring states may be within sight of one another,
the sounds of their chickens and dogs may be heard,
yet the people will grow old and die
without ever coming or going.

**Chapter on Manifesting Substance**

Truthful words are not beautiful;
beautiful words are not truthful.
The good do not argue;
those who argue are not good.
The wise are not broadly learned;
the broadly learned are not wise.
The sage does not accumulate—
having given all to others,
they possess even more.
Having bestowed all upon others,
they have even greater abundance.
The Dao of Heaven
benefits and does not harm.
The Dao of the sage
acts and does not contend.
