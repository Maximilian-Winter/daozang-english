# 老子道德经河上公章句

**Laozi’s *Daodejing* with Commentary by Heshang Gong**
**Chapter 1: Embracing the Dao (Title of the Section)**

The Dao that can be spoken of—
Refers to the Dao of classical learning, governance, and moral instruction.
Is not the eternal Dao.
It is not the Dao of natural generation and growth.
The eternal Dao should be nurtured through non-action to preserve the spirit, through non-interference to pacify the people, by concealing one’s brilliance, erasing traces, and hiding origins—it cannot be named.

The name that can be named—
Refers to wealth, honor, nobility, and fame that surpass the world.
Is not the eternal name.
It is not the name that naturally endures.
The eternal name should be like an infant who has not yet spoken, an egg that has not yet divided, a luminous pearl within an oyster, or fine jade embedded in stone—internally radiant, yet outwardly appearing dull and unrefined.

Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The nameless refers to the Dao. The Dao is formless, hence it cannot be named.
"Beginning" means the root of the Dao, which exhales qi and spreads transformation, emerging from emptiness and non-being to become the origin of Heaven and Earth.

Named, it is the mother of the myriad things.
The named refers to Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth possess form and position, yin and yang, softness and hardness—this is why they are named.
"Mother of the myriad things" means Heaven and Earth contain qi to generate the myriad things, nurturing them to maturity, like a mother raising her child.

Thus, by constantly being without desire, one may observe its subtleties.
"Subtleties" means essentials. If one can constantly be without desire, one may observe the essentials of the Dao—the essential being the One.
The One emerges to bestow names upon the Dao, praising and clarifying right and wrong.

By constantly having desire, one may observe its manifestations.
"Manifestations" means returns. Those who constantly have desires may observe what worldly customs return to and pursue.

These two emerge from the same source but have different names.
The two refer to having desire and being without desire.
"Emerge from the same source" means they both arise from the human heart.
"Different names" means their designations differ.
The name of being without desire endures, while the name of having desire leads to self-destruction.

Both are called profound.
"Profound" means Heaven. It means those with desires and those without both receive qi from Heaven.

Profound within the profound—
Within Heaven, there is yet another Heaven.
The endowment of qi varies in thickness; those who obtain harmony and nourishing essence give birth to the worthy and sagely, while those who receive disorder and defilement give birth to the greedy and licentious.

It is the gate of the myriad subtleties.
To enter the Heaven within Heaven, where the endowment of qi varies in thickness, one must eliminate emotions and desires to preserve harmony—this is called the gateway to knowing the essentials of the Dao.

**Chapter 2: Nurturing Life**

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
They exalt their own beauty, making it manifest.
This is already ugliness.
It leads to danger and ruin.
When all know goodness as goodness,
It brings merit and fame.
This is already not goodness.
It is what people contend over.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other.
Seeing being, one acts as non-being.
Difficulty and ease complete each other.
Seeing difficulty, one acts as ease.
Long and short define each other.
Seeing short, one acts as long.
High and low incline toward each other.
Seeing high, one acts as low.
Sound and voice harmonize with each other.
The superior sings, and the inferior must harmonize.
Front and back follow each other.
The superior acts, and the inferior must follow.

Therefore, the sage engages in non-action,
Governing through the Dao.
And practices the teaching without words,
Instructing through personal example.
The myriad things arise,
Each moving on its own,
Yet do not refuse.
They do not reject or resist.
They are born but do not possess.
The primordial qi generates the myriad things but does not possess them.
They act but do not rely on it.
The Dao enacts its works but does not rely on them, expecting no reward.
Their work is accomplished, yet they do not dwell in it.
When tasks are completed and affairs settled, they withdraw and do not occupy their position.
Only because they do not dwell in it,
Thus, they do not depart.
Virtue and fortune remain constant, never leaving their person.

This means one should not follow what is not practiced, nor know what is not spoken with urgency.
The six lines above—high and low, long and short—when the ruler opens one source, a hundred streams arise below. The variations of these hundred streams lead to unrest without end.

**Chapter 3: Pacifying the People**

Do not exalt the worthy—
The "worthy" refer to the worthy of世俗, those skilled in eloquence and literary refinement, who depart from the Dao to exercise power, abandoning substance for ornament.
"Not exalting" means not valuing them with emoluments or offices.
So that the people do not contend.
They will not contend for merit and fame, returning to naturalness.

Do not value goods that are hard to obtain—
This means the ruler does not indulge in rare treasures, casting gold aside in the mountains and discarding pearls and jade into the depths.
So that the people do not become thieves.
When the superior’s transformation is pure and tranquil, there are no greedy people below.

Do not display what is desirable—
Banish lewd music and keep beautiful people at a distance.
So that the people’s hearts are not confused.
They will not engage in licentiousness or be led into disorder.

Therefore, in the sage’s governance—
This explains that the sage’s governance of the state is the same as self-cultivation.
Empty their hearts—
Eliminate cravings and remove chaotic distractions.
Fill their bellies—
Embrace the Dao and hold fast to the One, guarding the five spirits.
Weaken their ambitions—
Be gentle, yielding, and modest, not occupying positions of power.
Strengthen their bones—
Cherish essence and value its application, filling the marrow and strengthening the bones.

Constantly cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire.
Return to simplicity and preserve purity.
So that those with cunning dare not act.
Their thoughts are deep, and they do not speak lightly.
Act through non-action—
Do not contrive; move in accordance with natural principles.
Then nothing will be ungoverned.
Virtue flourishes, and the people are at peace.

**Chapter 4: The Fathomless Source**

The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
"Empty" means the center. The Dao conceals its name and hides its reputation; its use lies in the center.
It is constantly not full.
"Constantly" means always. The Dao is always humble and never full.
Abysmal, it seems to be the ancestor of the myriad things.
The Dao is profound and unknowable, seemingly the ancestral origin of the myriad things.

Blunt its sharpness—
"Sharpness" means advancement. When people desire to advance their essence to seek merit and fame, they should be restrained, following the Dao’s example of not displaying itself.
Untangle its knots—
"Knots" mean entangled resentments. One should contemplate the Dao’s non-action to resolve them.
Soften its brilliance—

Hold your wisdom though it be uniquely insightful; know its obscurity, and do not use it to confuse others.
Blend with the dust.
Dwell among the common folk in shared dust and grime; do not set yourself apart.
Abiding in stillness, it seems ever-present.
One should remain profoundly tranquil, thus enduring without perishing.

I know not whose child it is—
Laozi says: I know not from whence the Dao arises.
It appears before the Lord of Heaven.
The Dao exists prior to the celestial sovereign; this speaks of the Dao as preceding the birth of Heaven and Earth.
To this day it endures, for it abides in tranquil stillness, untroubled by desires, guiding people to cultivate the body in accordance with the Dao.

**Chapter 5: The Void in Use**

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent—
Heaven bestows, Earth transforms, yet not through benevolence or grace, but by following nature.
They treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things, with humans as the most noble, yet they regard them as straw dogs or livestock, seeking no gratitude in return.

The sage is not benevolent—
The sage nurtures and sustains the people, yet not through benevolence or grace, but by emulating Heaven and Earth in following nature.
He treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The sage views the people as straw dogs or livestock, seeking no reverence or gratitude.

Between Heaven and Earth—
The space between Heaven and Earth is void, with harmonious qi flowing freely, thus the myriad things arise of themselves.
If one can eliminate passions and desires, moderate flavors, and purify the five viscera, then the numinous brightness will reside within.

It is like a bellows.
The bellows is empty within, yet one can produce sound and breath from it.
Vacant yet inexhaustible, moving to yield ever more.
When empty, it never reaches depletion; when set in motion, it produces yet more sound and breath.

Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion—
Many affairs harm the spirit; many words harm the body. When the mouth opens and the tongue moves, calamity must follow.
It is better to guard the center.
Better to preserve virtue within, nurturing the spirit, cherishing qi, and speaking sparingly.

**Chapter 6: The Formless Image**

The Valley Spirit does not die—
"Valley" means nourishment. If one can nourish the spirit, it will not die.
"Spirit" refers to the spirits of the five viscera: the liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the heart stores the *shen*, the kidneys store essence, and the spleen stores the will. If all five viscera are harmed, the five spirits depart.

This is called the Mysterious Female.
The undying resides in the Mysterious Female.
"Mysterious" is Heaven; in humans, it is the nose.
"Female" is Earth; in humans, it is the mouth.
Heaven feeds humans with the five qi, entering through the nose to lodge in the heart. The five qi are subtle and refined, becoming essence, spirit, acuity, brightness, and the five voices.
Its ghost is called the *hun*; the *hun* is yang, governing entry and exit through the human nose, communicating with Heaven—thus the nose is called "Mysterious."
Earth feeds humans with the five flavors, entering through the mouth to lodge in the stomach. The five flavors are turbid and coarse, becoming form, bones, flesh, blood, and the six emotions.
Its ghost is called the *po*; the *po* is yin, governing entry and exit through the human mouth, communicating with Earth—thus the mouth is called "Female."

The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
"Root" means origin.
The gates of the nose and mouth are where the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth comes and goes.

Subtly enduring, as if present—
The breath of nose and mouth should be soft and continuous, seemingly present, yet as if absent.
Use it without strain.
When using qi, one should be relaxed and unhurried, not urgent or laborious.

**Chapter 7: Concealing Radiance**

Heaven is eternal, Earth enduring—
This speaks of Heaven and Earth’s long life and longevity, serving as a lesson for humanity.
The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring is that they do not live for themselves.
Heaven and Earth alone endure long because they are tranquil, bestowing without seeking reward—unlike humans, who dwell in restless pursuit of self-enrichment, seizing from others to benefit themselves.

Thus they are everlasting.
Because they do not seek life, they can live long without end.

Therefore the sage places himself last—
Putting others before oneself.
Yet he comes first.
The world reveres him, placing him foremost as elder.
He sets himself aside—
Diminishing himself to magnify others.
Yet he endures.
The people love him like parents, and the numinous brightness protects him like a newborn—thus he always endures.

Is it not because he is selfless?
The sage is loved by the people and protected by the numinous brightness—is this not because of his impartiality and selflessness?
Thus he fulfills his private [aims].
What people consider private is the desire to enrich themselves. The sage, though selfless, naturally enriches himself—thus he fulfills his private [aims].

**Chapter 8: Transforming Nature**

The highest virtue is like water.
The person of highest virtue is like the nature of water.
Water benefits the myriad things yet does not contend—
In Heaven it becomes mist and dew; on Earth, it becomes springs and streams.
It dwells where the multitude abhor—
The multitude abhor low, damp, filthy places, yet water alone flows quietly through them.
Thus it is near to the Dao.
The nature of water is nearly identical to the Dao.

Dwelling in good earth—
Water naturally delights in the earth, flowing downward over grasses and trees, resembling the female yielding to the male.
The heart abides in profound depth—
Water is deep and empty, its depths clear and bright.
Giving with benevolent kindness—
The myriad things receive life from water.
"Giving" means emptiness, not fullness.
Speaking with truthful sincerity—
Water reflects forms within, never losing its true nature.
Governing with upright rectitude—
There is nothing it does not wash clean, becoming clear and level.
Handling affairs with skillful ability—
It can be square or round, bending or straight, adapting to form.
Moving with timely action—
Scattering in summer, congealing in winter, responding to the seasons without missing Heaven’s timing.

It is only because it does not contend—
Dam it and it stops; release it and it flows, obeying others.
Thus it is without blame.
Such is the nature of water—thus the world harbors no resentment toward it.

**Chapter 9: The Turning Axis**

To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping—
"Fill" means fullness.
"Stop" means cessation.
Holding fullness must lead to spillage; it is better to cease.
To carve and polish it cannot be long preserved—
"Carve" means to refine.
First refine it, but later it must be discarded.

Gold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them.
Indulgence and desire harm the spirit; wealth burdens the body.
Riches and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own misfortune.
The rich should relieve the poor; the noble should pity the lowly.
Yet if they turn to arrogance and excess, calamity will surely befall them.

Success achieved, fame attained, one retreats—this is the Dao of Heaven.
When one’s deeds are accomplished, affairs established, and reputation flourishes,
failing to retreat and withdraw from position invites harm.
This is the constant Dao of Heaven.
As the sun at its zenith must decline, the moon at full must wane,
things at their peak must decline, and joy at its extreme must turn to sorrow.

**Chapter 10: The Power of Capacity**

In bearing the soul,
"Soul" refers to the hun and po.
Man carries the hun and po to live—he must cherish and nurture them.
Joy and anger scatter the hun; sudden fright harms the po.
The hun resides in the liver, the po in the lungs.
Fine wine and rich meats corrode the liver and lungs.
Thus, when the hun is tranquil and the mind aligned with the Dao, it remains undisturbed;
when the po is at peace, one attains longevity.

Embrace the One—can you not let it depart?
To embrace the One is to keep it inseparable from the body, ensuring enduring existence.
The One is the primordial qi of the Dao’s origin, the essence of Great Harmony.
Thus it is said: The One spreads its name throughout the world.
Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes stable;
lords and kings attain the One to govern with equity.
Within, it is the heart; without, it is conduct.
Dispersed, it becomes virtue—all are named the One.
The One signifies an undivided, unwavering will.

Concentrate the qi to attain suppleness—
Guard the essence-qi without disturbance, so the body may respond with softness.
Can you be like an infant?
Like an infant, free from inner thoughts and outer affairs, the spirit does not depart.

Purify the profound mirror—
Wash the heart to keep it pure.
The heart dwells in the realm of mystery, perceiving all things—thus it is called the profound mirror.
Can you be without flaw?
Free from excess and perversion, pure and without blemish.

In loving the people and governing the state,
Those who cultivate the self love their qi to preserve their body;
those who govern the state love the people to secure its peace.
Can you practice non-action?
In cultivating the self, regulate breath and essence without letting the ears perceive;
in governing the state, bestow kindness and virtue without letting the people know.

The Gate of Heaven opens and closes—
The Gate of Heaven refers to the Purple Tenuity Palace at the North Pole.
Opening and closing signify the cycles of the Five Limits.
In cultivating the self, the Gate of Heaven refers to the nostrils:
opening is inhalation, closing is exhalation.
Can you act as the female?
In cultivating the self, be like the female—calm, still, and yielding.
In governing, respond to change, harmonizing without asserting.

Illuminating the Four Directions,
To be enlightened and clear, like the sun and moon radiating in all directions,
filling the world beyond the Eight Extremes.
Thus it is said: Seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard,
it pervades the ten directions, resplendent and radiant.
Can you be without knowledge?
None can fully comprehend the Dao that fills the world.

It gives life and nurtures—
The Dao gives life to the myriad things and nourishes them.
Giving life yet not possessing,
The Dao gives life to the myriad things without claiming ownership.
Acting yet not relying,
The Dao’s actions do not depend on expectation of reward.
Leading yet not dominating,
The Dao fosters the myriad things without controlling them as tools.
This is called profound virtue.
The Dao’s virtue is profound and unfathomable, beyond perception—
it urges man to emulate the Dao.

**Chapter 11: The Use of the Useless**

Thirty spokes share a single hub—
Ancient chariots had thirty spokes, corresponding to the lunar cycle.
They converge on one hub, where the hollow allows the spokes to unite.
In cultivating the self, remove passions and desires to empty the five viscera,
so the spirit may return.
In governing the state, few abilities unite the many weak to create strength.

It is the void that gives the wheel its use.
The void is emptiness.
The hub’s emptiness allows the wheel to turn; the carriage’s emptiness allows it to bear its load.

Clay is shaped into vessels—
Knead and blend earth to form vessels for food and drink.
It is the void that gives the vessel its use.
The vessel’s emptiness allows it to hold.

Carve doors and windows to make a room—
Constructing a dwelling.
It is the void that gives the room its use.
The emptiness of doors and windows allows entry and sight;
the room’s emptiness allows habitation.
Thus, being provides advantage—
Advantage lies in form and function.
A vessel holds things; a room shelters people.
One fears the roof’s collapse, just as the body fears the spirit’s departure.
Emptiness provides the use.
Emptiness alone can contain the myriad things—
thus it is said: the void governs the formed.
The Dao is emptiness.

**Chapter 12: Restraining Desires**

The five colors blind the eyes—
Excessive lust for beauty harms the essence and dims the eyes.
The five tones deafen the ears—
Indulgence in music scatters harmony from the heart, rendering one deaf to the soundless.
The five flavors dull the mouth—
"Dull" means loss.
Craving the five flavors harms the mouth, causing it to lose the Dao.
Galloping and hunting madden the heart—
The human spirit thrives in stillness.
Galloping and panting scatter the spirit, inducing madness.
Rare treasures obstruct conduct—
"Obstruct" means harm.
Rare treasures—gold, silver, pearls, jade—
stir greed and insatiable desire, leading to conduct that harms the body and invites disgrace.

Thus the sage attends to the belly—
Preserves the five natures, discards the six emotions,
tempers the will and qi, and nurtures the spirit.
Not to the eyes—
The eyes must not gaze recklessly, lest essence leak outward.
Thus he abandons that and embraces this—
Abandons the reckless gaze of the eyes, embraces the cultivation of the belly’s nature.

**Chapter 13: Disdaining Shame**

Favor and disgrace both bring alarm—
The body is alarmed by favor, alarmed by disgrace.
Regard great trouble as the self.

"Noble" means to fear. "If" means to arrive. It means great trouble arrives at the body, thus both alarm. What is meant by favor and disgrace? This asks what favor is and what disgrace is. Favor is honor and glory; disgrace is shame and humiliation. The phrase "arriving at the self and questioning it" is to enlighten others. Disgrace is lowly—(alternatively, "favor is high, disgrace is low")—disgrace is base and vile. To gain them is alarming: gaining favor and glory is alarming, for standing in high position is like treading deep peril. The noble dare not be arrogant; the wealthy dare not be extravagant. To lose them is alarming: losing means falling from favor into disgrace. Alarming means fearing calamity will strike again. This is what is meant by "favor and disgrace both bring alarm." This explains the earlier "gaining them is alarming, losing them is alarming."

What is meant by "regard great trouble as the self"? Again, questioning: why fear great trouble arriving at the self? The reason I have great trouble is that I have a self. The reason I have great trouble is that I have a self. Having a self brings worry—laboring over hunger and cold, indulging emotions and desires, thus encountering misfortune. If I had no self, what trouble would I have? If I had no body, attaining the Dao naturally, lightly ascending clouds, moving freely without obstruction, communing with the Dao as spirit—what trouble could there be? Thus one who values the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. This means that a ruler who values his own body and belittles others, desiring to be lord of the world, may be temporarily established but cannot endure. One who cherishes the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. This means that a ruler who cherishes his own body not for himself but to be a parent to the myriad people—such a one, becoming lord of the world, may be entrusted with his body above the people, enduring without fault.

**Chapter 14: Praising the Mysterious**

Looked at but unseen, it is called "even"—
Without color, it is "even." It means the One has no hue and cannot be seen by looking.
Listened to but unheard, it is called "rare"—
Without sound, it is "rare." It means the One has no tone and cannot be heard by listening.
Grasped but unattainable, it is called "subtle"—
Without form, it is "subtle." It means the One has no body and cannot be held by seizing.

These three cannot be exhaustively questioned—
The three refer to "even," "rare," and "subtle." They cannot be exhaustively questioned because, being without color, sound, or form, they cannot be spoken by the mouth, transmitted by writing, but must be received in stillness, sought with spirit, and cannot be obtained by questioning.

Thus they merge into the One.
"Merge" means to unite. Thus the three names unite as the One.

Above, it is not bright—
It means the One in the heavens is not bright. "Bright" means luminous.
Below, it is not dark—
It means the One beneath the heavens is not dark. "Dark" means obscure and shadowed.

Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—
"Vast and boundless" means its movement and action are endless. "Cannot be named" means it is not one color—it cannot be distinguished as green, yellow, white, or black; not one sound—it cannot be heard as gong, shang, jue, zhi, or yu; not one form—it cannot be measured as long or short, large or small.

It returns to nothingness—
"Nothingness" means formlessness. It should return to formlessness.

This is called the formless form—
It means the One has no form yet gives form to the myriad things.
The image of no-thing—
The One has no substance yet provides images for the myriad things.
This is called "elusive and indistinct"—
The One is elusive and indistinct, now present, now absent, and cannot be seen.

Meet it, yet its head is unseen—
The One has no beginning or end and cannot be awaited in advance. Abandon emotions and desires, and the One will return of itself.
Follow it, yet its rear is unseen—
The One leaves no trace and cannot be observed.

Holding fast to the ancient Dao to govern present realities,
The sage clings to the ancient Way, generating the One to govern things, knowing that the present must have its One.
To know the ancient beginning—this is called the discipline of the Dao.
One who knows the original Oneness of the primordial beginning is said to grasp the guiding thread of the Dao.

**Manifesting Virtue (15)**
The ancients skilled in being noble ones—
They were rulers who had attained the Dao.
Subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating,
"Profound" means Heaven. Their aspirations were subtle and wondrous, their essence communing with Heaven.
Deep beyond all knowing.
Their virtue and power were deep and far-reaching, unknowable and unfathomable. Inwardly, they saw as if blind; in reflection, they heard as if deaf—none could discern their excellence.
Only because they were unknowable were they forced to describe them thus:
Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;
In all undertakings, they acted with utmost caution. Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter—such was the difficulty in their hearts.
Cautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;
In advance and retreat, they were restrained, as if bound, like one who has broken the law, fearing that neighbors might discover it.
Respectful, as if a guest;
Like a guest before a host, solemn and without pretense.
Dissolving, like ice about to melt,
"Dissolving" means dispersing. "Melting" means vanishing. Abandoning emotions and desires, they grew daily more empty.
Sincere, like uncarved wood,
"Sincere" means thick and substantial. "Uncarved wood" means form undivided. Within, they guarded their essence and spirit; without, they bore no ornamentation.
Vast, like a valley;
"Vast" means broad and expansive. "Valley" means empty and hollow. Without merit, fame, or achievement, they embraced all things.
Turbid, like muddy water.
"Turbid" means guarding the original truth. "Muddy" means not clear and bright. They merged with the multitude, not asserting themselves.
Who can make the turbid still and gradually clear?
Who knows how to still the turbid water so that it slowly clears of itself?
Who can remain at rest and gradually quicken into life?
Who can remain tranquil for long and slowly bring forth life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Those who preserve this Way of gradual life do not seek excess or overflow.
Only because they are not full can they remain concealed and not newly accomplished.
Only those who are not full can guard what is hidden and not pursue new achievements.
"Concealed" means hiding one’s brilliance. "Newly accomplished" means prizing merit and fame.

**Returning to the Root (16)**
Attain utmost emptiness,
Those who attain the Dao cast off emotions and desires, purifying the five viscera to reach utmost emptiness.
Guard stillness with sincerity.
Guard clarity and stillness, acting with sincerity and depth.
The myriad things arise together,
"Arise" means to be born. The myriad things are born together.
And I thereby observe their return.
I observe that all things without exception return to their root. One should reflect deeply on this root.
Now, things flourish abundantly,
"Flourish abundantly" means leaves and blossoms in full bloom.
Yet each returns to its root.
All things without exception wither and fall, each returning to its root to be born anew.
Returning to the root is called stillness.
"Stillness" refers to the root. The root is tranquil, soft, and weak, humble and lowly—thus it does not die again.
This is called returning to life.
To be tranquil is to return to one’s nature and life, rendering death impossible.
Returning to life is called constancy.
To return to life and escape death is the constant practice of the Dao.
To know constancy is called illumination;
To know the constant practice of the Dao is to be enlightened.
Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.
Not knowing the constant practice of the Dao, reckless and cunning actions lose the spirit’s clarity—hence misfortune.
Knowing constancy, one embraces all;
To know the constant practice of the Dao is to cast off emotions and forget desires, embracing all things without exception.
Embracing all, one is impartial;
To embrace all things is to be just and selfless, with no evil able to withstand it.
Impartial, one is kingly;
To be just and selfless is to be fit to rule the world. Governing the body rightly unifies its form; a thousand spirits and ten thousand numina converge in one’s person.
Kingly, one is heavenly;
To be kingly is to have virtue harmonize with the numinous—thus one communes with Heaven.
Heavenly, one is of the Dao;
To commune with Heaven is to unite with the Dao.
Of the Dao, one endures long.
United with the Dao, one attains longevity.
Even in death, one is not imperiled.
To be impartial and kingly, to commune with Heaven and unite with the Dao—possessing these four in purity, with virtue vast and far-reaching, free from calamity and blame, one perishes with Heaven and Earth, never imperiled.

**Pure Wind (17)**
In the highest antiquity, those below knew only that it existed.
"Highest antiquity" refers to the nameless rulers of primordial times. "Those below knew only that it existed" means the people knew their ruler existed but did not serve as subjects—such was their simplicity.
Next, they drew near and praised him.
His virtue was manifest, his kindness and favor worthy of praise—thus they cherished and extolled him.
Next, they feared him.
He established laws and punishments to govern them.
Next, they scorned him.
Prohibitions multiplied and commands grew burdensome, making sincerity impossible—thus they deceived and scorned him.
When trust is insufficient, there is distrust.
When the ruler’s trust in the people is insufficient, the people respond with distrust, deceiving their ruler.
How cautiously they valued their words!
Speaking of the rulers of highest antiquity, they acted with caution, prizing their words, fearing to depart from the Dao and lose their spontaneity.
Their tasks were accomplished, their affairs completed,
This means the world was at great peace.
Yet the common people all said, "We are naturally so."
The common people, not knowing the ruler’s virtue was profound and thick, instead believed they were naturally so.

**The Decline of Custom (18)**
When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.
In the age of the great Dao, every household had its filial child, every door its loyal and trustworthy member—benevolence and righteousness were unseen. When the great Dao is abandoned and unused, evil and rebellion arise, and only then are benevolence and righteousness transmitted.
When wisdom and cunning emerge, there is great deception.
When rulers value words over virtue and ornament over substance, those below respond with great deception and treachery.
When the six relations are not at peace, there is filial piety and kindness.
When the six bonds are severed and kin do not harmonize, only then do filial piety and kindness nurture one another.
When the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.
When decrees are unclear, superiors and inferiors resent one another, and the perverse contend for power, only then do loyal ministers correct their rulers.

When the world is at great peace, none know benevolence; when all people are without desire, none know integrity; when each purifies themselves, none know chastity. In the age of the great Dao, benevolence and righteousness vanish, filial piety and kindness fade—like the sun at its zenith, radiant and bright, while the host of stars lose their light.

**Returning to Simplicity, Nineteenth**
**Abandoning Sagacity**
Abandon the sagacity of inventions; return to the origin and guard the primordial. The Five Emperors hung their symbols, Cang Jie created writing—yet these are not equal to the knotted cords of the Three Sovereigns, which bore no ornament. Abandon wisdom, abandon cleverness, and return to non-action. The people’s benefit increases a hundredfold. Farming prospers, and the public knows no private gain.

**Abandoning Benevolence and Righteousness**
Abandon the display of benevolence and the esteem for fine words. The people return to filial piety and kindness—virtue transforms them, making them pure.

**Abandoning Cunning and Profit**
Abandon cunning, for it is deception that confounds truth. Abandon profit, for it blocks the path of greed and shuts the gates of power. Then thieves and bandits will cease to exist. Above, transformation is impartial; below, there is no perverse self-interest.

These three—referring to the three things abandoned above—are deemed insufficient as cultural refinements. For cultural refinements are insufficient to teach the people, thus they must be given something to belong to, as in the lines below:

**Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity**
To "manifest plainness" is to hold fast to the unadorned and guard the true, not esteeming embellishment. To "embrace simplicity" is to hold to one’s unvarnished nature, displaying it to those below so they may take it as a model.

**Lessen self-interest, reduce desires**
To "lessen self-interest" is to rectify and eliminate private concerns. To "reduce desires" is to know contentment.

**Different Customs, Twentieth**
**Abandoning Learning**

To abandon learning is not true; it does not accord with the Dao’s pattern. Without care. By removing superficial adornments, there is no care or calamity. "Yea" and "nay"—how far apart are they? Both are responses, yet how far do they diverge? The age exalts embellishment and devalues substance. Good and evil—how far apart are they? Good elicits praise, evil invites remonstrance; how far do they truly diverge? The age detests loyalty and uprightness, employing the devious and obsequious.

What people fear, one cannot but fear. "People" refers to followers of the Dao. What people fear is the ruler who does not abandon learning. One cannot but fear this, for it brings flattery near and slays the humane and worthy. How vast and boundless it is! The world’s customs are chaotic, desiring to advance learning for embellishment, never ceasing.

The multitude, radiant and gleeful—gleeful, indulging in excess and many desires—like one feasting on a grand sacrifice, like a starving man craving the full spread, never sated. Like ascending a terrace in spring—spring, when yin and yang commingle, and the myriad things stir; gazing from the terrace, the will drifts in surfeit.

I alone am cautious, without sign—cautious and tranquil, without the form or omen of desire. Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. Adrift, as if with nowhere to return. The multitude all have more than enough—surplus wealth for extravagance, surplus cunning for deceit. Yet I alone seem forsaken, as though lacking.

Ah, the heart of a fool is mine! Not following the common crowd, holding fast to the One without wavering, like the heart of a fool. Murky, murky—without distinction. The common folk are bright and clear—lucid and penetrating. I alone seem dim, like one benighted. The common folk are keen and sharp—keen and swift. I alone am dull and vague, without division or severance.

Swift as the sea—I alone am swift, like the flowing river or sea, its limits unknown. Drifting, as if without end—I alone drift, now soaring, now rising, without cessation, my aspiration dwelling in the realm of spirit. The multitude all have their means—means, that is, their doings.

And I alone am stubborn—I alone practice non-action, seeming coarse. Coarse, as though inadequate.

I alone differ from others—I alone diverge from the common. Yet I honor the nourishment of the Mother. Nourishment, that is, application. Mother, that is, the Dao. I alone honor the application of the Dao.

**Emptying the Heart (Chapter 21)**
The bearing of great virtue—
Great, that is, vast. The person of great virtue embraces all without exception, receives the impure and turbid, and dwells in humility.

Only the Dao is followed.
Only, that is, solely. The person of great virtue does not follow the ways of the common world but adheres solely to the Dao.

As for the Dao as a thing, it is only fleeting, only elusive.
The Dao in relation to the ten thousand things is uniquely fleeting and elusive in its comings and goings, without fixed abode.

Elusive, fleeting—within it there are images.
The Dao is only elusive and formless, yet within it lie the patterns of the ten thousand things.

Fleeting, elusive—within it there is something.
The Dao is only fleeting and elusive, yet within it there is the One, managing and engendering transformation, establishing substance through qi.

Profound, obscure—within it there is essence.
The Dao is only profound and obscure, formless, yet within it lies true essence, where spirit and brightness intermingle, and yin and yang converge.

Its essence is utterly real.
The Dao’s essential qi is wondrously real, without adornment.

Within it there is sincerity.
The Dao conceals its merit and hides its name, yet its sincerity resides within.

From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.
From, that is, since. From ancient times to the present, the Dao remains constant, never departing.

By this, the multitude of beginnings is beheld.
Beheld, that is, endowed. Beginnings, that is, origins. The Dao endows and initiates the birth of the ten thousand things, which receive qi from the Dao.

How do I know the thusness of the multitude of beginnings?
How do I know that the ten thousand things receive qi from the Dao?

By this.
This, that is, the present. By observing that all things today receive the Dao’s essential qi to live, move, act, and dwell—nothing exists without the Dao.

**Increasing Humility (Chapter 22)**
To yield is to be preserved whole.
To yield oneself and follow others, not acting on one’s own, is to preserve the body.

To bend is to be made straight.
To bend is to humble oneself and elevate others; in time, one naturally becomes straight.

To be hollow is to be filled.
The earth is hollow and low, so water flows to it; a person is humble and low, so virtue gathers in them.

To be worn is to be renewed.
To accept wear and thinness, putting others first and oneself last, the world will respect them, and in time, they will be renewed.

To have little is to gain.
To accept little for oneself is to gain much, for the Dao of Heaven aids the humble, and spirit brightness abides in emptiness.

To have much is to be perplexed.
Those with abundant wealth are perplexed by what they guard; those with abundant learning are perplexed by what they hear.

Thus the sage embraces the One as a model for the world.
Embraces, that is, holds fast. Model, that is, standard. The sage holds fast to the One and thereby comprehends all affairs, serving as a model for the world.

Not seeing on one’s own, therefore clear.
The sage does not use their own eyes to see beyond a thousand li but relies on the eyes of the world to see, thus achieving clarity and penetration.

Not asserting oneself, therefore distinguished.
The sage does not insist on their own rightness and reject others, thus becoming distinguished in the world.

Not boasting, therefore meritorious.
Boasting, that is, claiming. The sage’s virtue flows and transforms without claiming its beauty, thus achieving merit for the world.

Not exalting oneself, therefore enduring.
Exalting, that is, magnifying. The sage does not elevate themselves, thus enduring without peril.

It is only because they do not contend that the world cannot contend with them.
This means that none in the world, whether worthy or unworthy, can contend with one who does not contend.

The ancient saying, “To yield is to be preserved whole,” is no empty word.
The transmitted ancient words—yielding and following preserves the body—are not false.

Truly whole, they return to it.
Truly, that is, in reality. One who can practice yielding and following truly preserves their body, returning it to their parents unharmed.

**Emptiness and Non-Being (Chapter 23)**
Sparse words accord with nature.

Sparse words mean cherishing speech. To cherish speech is the Dao of nature. Thus, whirlwinds do not last the morning, nor do sudden rains last the day. Whirlwinds are swift winds; sudden rains are violent rains. This means swiftness cannot endure, nor can violence last long. Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth. Who—meaning, who—creates these whirlwinds and violent rains? They are the work of Heaven and Earth. Yet even Heaven and Earth cannot make them last, cannot extend them from dawn to dusk. How much less can humans do so? Though Heaven and Earth, most numinous, combine to form whirlwinds and violent rains, they still cannot make them endure from morning to evening—how much less should humans desire to act with sudden violence?

Therefore, those who engage in the Dao—
*Engage* means *to act*. When humans act, they should be as still as the Dao, not like whirlwinds or sudden rains—
those of the Dao are one with the Dao.
*Those of the Dao* refers to those who love the Dao. *One with the Dao* means to be in harmony with the Dao.
Those of virtue are one with virtue.
*Those of virtue* refers to those who love virtue. *One with virtue* means to be in harmony with virtue.
Those of loss are one with loss.
*Loss* means to rely on oneself and lose others. *One with loss* means to be in harmony with loss.

Those one with the Dao—the Dao, too, delights in attaining them.
Those in harmony with the Dao—the Dao, too, delights in attaining them.
Those one with virtue—virtue, too, delights in attaining them.
Those in harmony with virtue—virtue, too, delights in attaining them.
Those one with loss—loss, too, delights in attaining them.
Those in harmony with loss—loss, too, delights in attaining them.

When trust is insufficient—
When the ruler’s trust in those below is insufficient, those below respond to the ruler with distrust—
there is distrust.
This speaks of how things of a kind gather together, how sounds of the same tone resonate, how qi of the same nature seek one another. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger, water flows toward the damp, fire moves toward the dry—these are the natural categories.

**Forced Favor (Chapter 24)**
Those who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm;

"To stand on tiptoe" means to advance. It refers to those who covet power and fame, who seek achievement and glory—such people cannot long stand firm in body or walk the Way.

"Those who stride do not walk"—
Those who consider themselves noble and stride above others will be collectively obstructed by the people, preventing them from moving forward.

"Those who display themselves are not enlightened"—
People who display their own appearance as fine, who regard their own conduct as conforming to the Way, do not realize how ugly their form is, how base their conduct.

"Those who are self-righteous are not illustrious"—
Those who consider themselves right and others wrong will be collectively obstructed by the people, preventing their brilliance from shining forth.

"Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit"—
Those who constantly boast and claim merit for themselves lose the merit they might have gained from others.

"Those who are self-conceited do not endure"—
Those who are fond of self-aggrandizement cannot long endure.

In relation to the Way, these are called "leftover food and parasitic conduct."
"Parasitic" means greedy. If such self-aggrandizing and boastful people were in the Way of governing a state, they would daily levy taxes to amass surplus provisions, engaging in greedy conduct.

All things may detest them—
When such people hold office, their every action seeks to harm, so there is nothing that does not fear and detest them.

Thus, those who possess the Way do not remain.
This means that those who possess the Way do not dwell in such a state.

**Image of the Origin (Chapter 25)**
There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.
It refers to the formless Dao, which in its undifferentiated state gives rise to the myriad things, existing before heaven and earth.

Silent and empty, it stands alone and does not change—
"Silent" means without sound. "Empty" means without form. "Stands alone" means without peer. "Does not change" means its transformations are constant.

It travels everywhere without exhaustion—
The Dao circulates through heaven and earth, penetrating all things. In the yang it does not scorch, in the yin it does not rot. It passes through all without peril or weariness.

It may be called the Mother of all under heaven—
The Dao nurtures the essential qi of the myriad things, like a mother nurturing her child.

I do not know its name; I style it "Dao"—
I do not see the Dao’s form, nor know how to name it. Seeing that all things arise from the Dao, I style it "Dao."

Forcing a name upon it, I call it "Great"—
Not knowing its name, I forcefully call it "Great," for it is lofty without superior, all-encompassing without boundary, embracing all things—thus I call it "Great."

"Great" means "it goes"—
Its greatness is not like heaven, which is always above, nor like earth, which is always below. Rather, it departs, having no fixed abode.

"It goes" means "it is distant"—
"Distant" means it reaches the limitless, spreading its qi through heaven and earth, penetrating all without obstruction.

"Distant" means "it returns"—
Though distant, it does not sever its connection, but returns to dwell within the human body.

Thus, the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king (or "the human") is also great—
The Dao is great because it encompasses heaven and earth, containing all things. Heaven is great because it covers all without exception. Earth is great because it bears all without exception. The king is great because he governs all without exception.

Within the realm, there are four great things—
The four great things are the Dao, heaven, earth, and the king.

Yet any designation or name falls short of its ultimate reality—
To speak of the Dao is to speak of what it arises from; having arisen, it is then called the Dao. Yet this "greatness" within names is not as great as namelessness. The nameless cannot be captured by names—this is the realm.

Heaven, earth, and the king all reside within this nameless realm. Thus it is said, "Within the realm, there are four great things."

And the king occupies one of them—
Within the eight directions, there are four great things, and the king occupies one of them.

Humans model themselves on earth—
Humans should model themselves on earth’s tranquility and gentle harmony. Planting yields the five grains; digging yields sweet springs. It labors without complaint, achieves without claiming credit.

Earth models itself on heaven—
Heaven is serene and unmoving, bestowing without seeking repayment, nurturing the myriad things without taking possession.

Heaven models itself on the Dao—
The Dao is clear and still, silently circulating its essential qi, allowing the myriad things to form of themselves.

The Dao models itself on the natural—
The nature of the Dao is spontaneous, without anything it models itself upon.

**Valuing Power (Chapter 26)**
Heaviness is the root of lightness—
If a ruler is not heavy, he will not be revered. If one does not value heaviness in cultivating the self, one loses one’s spirit. The flowers and leaves of plants are light, so they wither and fall; their roots are heavy, so they endure.

Stillness is the lord of restlessness—
If a ruler is not still, he loses his authority. If one does not value stillness in cultivating the self, one’s life is imperiled. The dragon is still, so it can transform; the tiger is restless, so it suffers early loss.

Thus, the sage travels all day yet does not depart from the heavy and still—
"Still" refers to tranquility. The sage travels the Way all day yet does not depart from stillness and heaviness.

Though there be splendid sights, he dwells in them with transcendent ease—
"Splendid sights" refer to palaces and towers. "Dwells in them" refers to the residences of consorts and concubines. "Transcendent ease" means keeping a distance and not residing in them.

How could the lord of ten thousand chariots—
"How could" is an expression of lament for the rulers of the age. The "lord of ten thousand chariots" refers to the king.

Treat his person as light beneath all under heaven?
The king is most revered, yet how could he conduct himself with frivolity and restlessness? This laments how the rulers of the age indulge in extravagance and reckless dissipation.

Lightness loses the ministers—
If a ruler is frivolous and dissolute, he loses his ministers. If one is frivolous and dissolute in cultivating the self, one loses one’s essence.

Restlessness loses the lord—
If a ruler acts with haste and impatience, he loses his throne. If one is hasty and impatient in cultivating the self, one loses one’s spirit.

**Skillful Application (Chapter 27)**
"In good traveling, there are no wheel tracks—"

One who skillfully practices the Dao seeks it within the self, never descending the hall nor stepping beyond the gate—thus leaving no wheel tracks. Skillful speech bears no flaw or blame, for one who chooses words with care speaks without blemish or fault under heaven. Skillful calculation requires no counting rods, for one who reckons affairs by the Dao abides in unity without deviation; when calculations are few, they may be known without counting rods. Skillful closure needs no bolt or bar, yet cannot be opened, for one who seals desires and guards the spirit by the Dao does not rely on doors or bolts that may be undone. Skillful binding uses no cords or knots, yet cannot be untied, for one who binds affairs by the Dao binds the heart in such a way that no cord may loose it.

Thus the sage constantly excels at saving people—by teaching loyalty and filial piety, desiring to preserve their nature and lives—so that none are cast aside, and noble and base each find their place. The sage constantly excels at saving things—by teaching the people to follow the four seasons, desiring to preserve all things from harm—so that nothing is cast aside. The sage does not despise the worthless nor prize jade, regarding them as one. This is called "inheriting the light." The sage’s skill in saving people and things is called inheriting the luminous Dao.

Therefore, the good serve as teachers to the not-good; those who practice goodness are taken by the sage as models for others. The not-good serve as resources for the good, for even those who act without goodness are taught and guided by the sage to become useful. If one does not value one’s teacher, one lacks support; if one does not cherish one’s resources, one has nothing to employ. Though one may deem oneself wise, this is great delusion. This is called the essential mystery.

**Returning to Simplicity (Chapter 28)**
Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and become the valley of the world. The masculine symbolizes honor; the feminine, humility. Though one may know one’s own honor and distinction, one should still guard humility, abandoning the strength of the masculine for the softness of the feminine. Thus the world turns to one as water flows into a deep valley. As the valley of the world, one’s constant virtue never departs, and one returns to the state of an infant—clumsy and without knowledge.

Know the bright, yet guard the dark, and become the model for the world. The bright symbolizes clarity; the dark, obscurity. Though one may know one’s own clarity, one should still guard obscurity, as if dim and seeing nothing. Thus one may become the model for the world, and one’s constant virtue remains unerring. As the model for the world, one’s constant virtue never falters, and one returns to the boundless. When virtue never falters, life endures and returns to the infinite.

Know glory, yet guard disgrace, and become the valley of the world. Glory symbolizes honor; disgrace, defilement. One who knows one’s own glory should still guard defilement. Thus the world turns to one as water flows into a deep valley. As the valley of the world, one’s constant virtue is fulfilled—for "fulfilled" means "settled." One who becomes the valley of the world finds virtue ever settled within. One returns to simplicity. When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; vessels are for use. When the simplicity of the myriad things scatters, it becomes implements. When the Dao scatters, it becomes spirit and illumination, flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the five phases. When the sage employs it, it becomes the leader of officials. Thus great governance does not sever. When the sage employs it, the great Dao governs the world without harm, and in cultivating the self, it governs desires without injuring the spirit.

**Non-Action (Chapter 29)**
Those who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon (or: cannot be grasped). Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.

Thus things may go ahead or follow behind, may exhale warmly or blow cold, may be strong or weak, may be secure or imperiled. Therefore the sage discards excess, extravagance, and extravagance. By abandoning these three, dwelling in harmony, and practicing non-action, the world transforms of itself.

**Frugality and Restraint in Warfare (Chapter 30)**
One who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use arms to strengthen the world. Such affairs tend to rebound. Where armies camp, brambles grow. When war passes, farmland lies abandoned, fields go untended.

**After Great Armies (Continuation of Chapter 30)**
In the wake of great armies, there must be years of famine. Heaven responds with malign qi, harming the five grains and injuring all people. The good warrior achieves results and stops—merely resolute, not glorying in it. He does not dare seize strength through force. He is resolute but not boastful, resolute but not vaunting, resolute but not arrogant. Resolute action arises only from necessity, not coercion. Resolute but not overbearing. All things, when they reach their prime, begin to age—grass and trees flourish to their peak, then wither and fall; men grow strong to their height, then decline. To say that strength can endure is called "not the Dao." Withering and aging come from failing to follow the Dao. Those who do not follow the Dao perish early.

**Against Arms (Chapter 31)**
Fine weaponry is an instrument of ill omen. "Fine" means adornment; "omen" means good. Arms disturb the spirit and muddy harmonious qi—an implement not good for men, not to be embellished. All things may despise it, for when arms move, they bring harm. Thus one who embodies the Dao does not dwell in such a state.

The noble person at rest values the left; in warfare, he values the right. This shows that the way of arms is the opposite of the noble person’s way, and what they value differs. Arms are instruments of ill omen, implements of harm. They are not the noble person’s instruments, not what he esteems. Only when unavoidable does he employ them—when facing decline, disorder, or calamity, wishing to shield the myriad people, he uses them to defend himself. Serenity is supreme. He does not covet lands or profit from others’ wealth. Though victorious, he does not celebrate it, for to celebrate victory is to delight in killing. One who delights in killing cannot fulfill his will in the world. A ruler who takes pleasure in killing cannot be entrusted with dominion over all under heaven, for as a lord of men, he would wield power over life and death, wantonly meting out punishments and executions.

In auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right. The deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right. The deputy general, though humble, occupies the yang position because he does not hold sole authority over killing. The supreme general, though exalted, occupies the yin position because he alone commands slaughter. This is to treat it as mourning rites. The supreme general stands on the right, for mourning rites honor the right, and the dead are valued in yin. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrow and tears, for one’s virtue is too meager to transform others through the Dao, and the harm falls upon the innocent. When victorious, observe it with mourning rites. In ancient times, after victory, the general took the position of the chief mourner, wearing plain robes and weeping—showing that the noble person values virtue and disdains arms, that he does not rejoice in punishing the inauspicious, that his heart finds no joy in it, likening it to mourning. He grieves for the unending wars of later generations.

**The Unnamable Virtue (Chapter 32)**
The Dao is eternally nameless.

The Dao can be yin, can be yang,
can relax, can tense,
can endure, can perish—
thus it has no constant name.
Though the uncarved block is small,
none under heaven can make it a subject.
Though the Dao’s simplicity is small,
subtle and formless,
none under heaven dare employ it as a servant.

Should lords and kings hold fast to it,
the myriad things will of themselves submit.
Should lords and kings guard the Dao and practice non-action,
the myriad things will of themselves submit,
yielding to its virtue.

Heaven and earth unite,
and sweet dew descends—
when the actions of lords and kings accord with heaven,
heaven bestows sweet dew and auspicious omens.
The people, without command, of themselves find balance.
When heaven sends down sweet dew and auspicious omens,
the myriad things, without instruction,
all attain harmony as one.

In the beginning, there is naming:
The beginning is the Dao.
The named are the myriad things.
The nameless Dao governs the named,
the formless governs the formed.

Once names exist,
all things, having desires,
rebel against the Dao and depart from virtue,
thus bringing ruin and disgrace upon themselves.
Yet if one models oneself on the Dao and practices virtue,
heaven will of itself acknowledge it.
When heaven acknowledges it,
spirits protect and assist,
and danger and decay are no more.

The Dao’s presence in the world
is like valleys and streams flowing into rivers and seas.
They respond to one another as naturally as watercourses merge.

**Distinguishing Virtue (Chapter 33)**
To know others is wisdom—
to discern their likes and dislikes is wisdom.
To know oneself is clarity—
to recognize one’s worth or unworthiness
is to listen without sound, to see without form,
thus it is clarity.

To overcome others is to have force—
to do so is no more than to rely on power.
To overcome oneself is strength—
to conquer one’s own desires,
none under heaven can contend with such a one,
thus it is strength.

To know contentment is wealth—
to know contentment is to preserve blessings and prosperity,
thus it is wealth.
To act with perseverance is to have resolve—
to strive diligently in goodness
is to set one’s will upon the Dao,
and the Dao sets its will upon such a one.

To not lose one’s place is to endure—
to nurture oneself and not lose
the celestial qi one has received
is to attain longevity.
To die yet not perish is to live long—
to not let the eyes wander in vain,
the ears listen in vain,
the mouth speak in vain,
is to incur no resentment under heaven,
thus to live long.

**Assuming Completion (Chapter 34)**
Vast flows the great Dao—

Vast flows the great Dao—
ebbing and surging, now floating, now sinking,
now present, now absent,
seen yet unseen,
spoken yet hard to distinguish.
It may turn left or right,
for the Dao may go left or right,
nowhere is it unfit.
The ten thousand things rely upon it to live—
*rely*: to depend upon.
All things depend upon the Dao to live,
yet it does not refuse them,
for the Dao does not reject or hinder.
Its work complete, it claims no possession—
with the Dao, one does not claim merit for its achievements.
It nurtures and sustains the ten thousand things yet does not rule over them,
though the Dao loves and nourishes all things, it is not like a lord who takes possession.
Ever without desire, it may be called small—
the Dao conceals its power and hides its name,
serene and without action, it seems as if faint and small.
The ten thousand things return to it yet it does not rule over them—
all things return to the Dao to receive qi,
yet the Dao is not like a lord who imposes restrictions.
Thus it may be called great—
the ten thousand things come and go freely,
allowing names to arise naturally, so it may be called great.
Therefore the sage never acts as though great,
for the sage models the Dao, concealing power and hiding names, never claiming fullness or greatness.
Thus they are able to perfect their greatness—
the sage guides by personal example, transforming without words,
all affairs ordered and cultivated, thus able to perfect their greatness.

**Virtue of Humaneness (Chapter 35)**
Hold fast to the great image, and all under heaven will come.
*Hold fast*: to uphold.
*Image*: the Dao.
When the sage upholds the great Dao,
the hearts of the ten thousand people turn and return to them.
In cultivating the self, celestial spirits and luminous beings descend,
coming and going within.
They come yet do no harm, bringing peace, tranquility, and great harmony—
when the ten thousand people return without injury,
the state attains peace and great harmony.
In cultivating the self without harming the spirits,
the body attains peace and great longevity.
Music and delicacies make the passing traveler pause—
*delicacies*: fine foods.
*passing traveler*: the One.
When one delights in the Dao’s excellence,
the One lingers.
The One departs from fullness and dwells in emptiness,
fleeting like a passing traveler.
The Dao that issues from the mouth is bland, without flavor—
the Dao enters and leaves the mouth,
so subtle it is unlike the five flavors of sour, salty, bitter, sweet, or pungent.
Gazing upon it, one cannot see enough—
*enough*: to attain.
The Dao is formless,
unlike the five colors of blue, yellow, red, white, or black that can be seen.
Listening to it, one cannot hear enough—
the Dao is unlike the five notes of gong, shang, jue, zhi, or yu that can be heard.
Using it, one cannot exhaust it—
*exhaust*: to deplete.

Governing the state with the Dao brings peace and prosperity to the people. Cultivating the self with it extends life and longevity, without ever reaching an end.

**Chapter 36: Subtle Illumination**
To gather, one must first expand.
The prior expansion aims to exhaust excess and indulgence.
To weaken, one must first strengthen.
The prior strengthening aims to invite misfortune.
To abolish, one must first elevate.
The prior elevation aims to foster arrogance and peril.
To seize, one must first give.
The prior giving aims to satiate greed.
This is called subtle illumination.
These four matters—subtle in method, yet manifest in effect.

The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
The soft and weak endure, while the hard and strong perish first.
Fish must not leave the depths—
if a fish leaves the depths, it abandons hardness for softness and can no longer be controlled.
A state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.
*Sharp instruments*: the arts of power and strategy.
The strategies of statecraft must not be revealed to ministers in office.
The Dao of self-cultivation must not be shown to those unworthy of it.

**Chapter 37: On Governance**
The Dao is ever non-action, yet nothing is left undone.
The Dao’s constancy lies in non-action.
If lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.
If lords and kings abide by the Dao, the myriad things will naturally emulate them.
Should transformation give rise to desire, I will suppress it with the nameless uncarved block.
*I*: the self.
*The nameless uncarved block*: the Dao and its virtue.
When the myriad things have emulated the self and yet desire to act with cunning and deceit, lords and kings must personally suppress and pacify them with the Dao and its virtue.
The nameless uncarved block is also free of desire.
Without desire, there is stillness—
if lords and kings pacify with the Dao and its virtue, the people too will be free of desire, and thus should be guided with clarity and stillness.
The world will then stabilize itself.
Those who can do this will bring the world to natural order and stability.

**Chapter 38: On Virtue**
The highest virtue does not act as virtue—
*highest virtue*: the rulers of remote antiquity without titles or names, whose virtue was supreme, hence called "highest virtue."
*Does not act as virtue*: they did not govern the people through virtuous teachings but followed nature, nurturing the people’s nature and life. Their virtue was unseen, hence called "does not act as virtue."
Thus they possess virtue.
Their virtue aligns with heaven and earth, harmonious qi flows freely, and the people’s virtue remains whole.
Lesser virtue does not lose virtue—
*lesser virtue*: rulers with posthumous titles, whose virtue does not match the highest, hence called "lesser virtue."
*Does not lose virtue*: their virtue is visible, their achievements praiseworthy.
Thus they lack virtue.
Because of their titles and personal fame.
The highest virtue practices non-action—
they model themselves on the Dao’s tranquility, refraining from all contrivance.
And has no purpose—
they do not act for the sake of titles or fame.

The lesser virtue acts—
this refers to issuing teachings and commands, implementing governance.
And has purpose—
this means acting to acquire titles and fame for oneself.

The highest benevolence acts—
*highest benevolence*: rulers who practice benevolence, whose benevolence is supreme, hence called "highest benevolence."
Acting here means bestowing kindness upon others.
Yet has no purpose—
once merit is achieved and affairs are established, they do not cling to action.

The highest righteousness acts—
acting with righteousness to make judgments and divisions.
Yet has purpose—
their actions are for their own sake, killing to establish authority, harming inferiors to enrich themselves.

The highest propriety acts—
*highest propriety*: rulers whose propriety is supreme, hence called "highest propriety."
Acting here means establishing ritual systems and ordering ceremonial dignity.
Yet none respond—
this means propriety is florid but substance is lacking, adornments and deceit are excessive, and movement strays from the Dao, making it impossible to respond.
Then they roll up their sleeves and drag others along—
this means propriety’s excesses make response impossible, leading to conflict between superiors and inferiors, hence they roll up their sleeves and pull one another.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
this means the Dao declines and virtuous transformation arises.
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
this means virtue declines and benevolent love appears.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
this means benevolence declines and distinctions of righteousness become clear.
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows—
this means righteousness declines and ritual exchanges with jade and silk arise.

Now, propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust—
this means propriety abandons the root to govern the branches, and loyalty and trust daily grow thinner.
And the beginning of chaos—
propriety values ornament over substance, thus uprightness daily diminishes while deceit and disorder daily increase.

Those with foresight are the blossoms of the Dao—
those who claim knowledge without true knowing are called "foresight"; such people, in the Dao’s decline, grasp only its blossoms.
And the beginning of foolishness—
this means those with foresight are the vanguard of ignorance and darkness.

Therefore, the great man abides in the substantial—
*great man*: the ruler who attains the Dao.
Abiding in the substantial means dwelling in simplicity and sincerity.
Not in the insubstantial—
not dwelling in ways that violate the Dao and bring worldly turmoil.
Abides in the real—
dwelling in loyalty and trust.
Not in the ornamental—
not prizing florid speech.
Thus, he rejects that and embraces this—
rejecting the ornamental and insubstantial, embracing the real and substantial.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Attaining Unity**

Of old, those who attained the One:
*Of old*: in the past.
*One*: non-action, the child of the Dao.

Heaven attained the One and became clear—
this means heaven attained the One and thus could display its luminous signs.
Earth attained the One and became stable—
this means earth attained the One and thus could remain tranquil and unshaken.
The spirits attained the One and became numinous—
this means the spirits attained the One and thus could transform without form.
The valleys attained the One and became full—
this means the valleys attained the One and thus could remain full without exhaustion.
The myriad things attained the One and came to life—
this means all things require the Dao to come into being.
The lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world—
this means the lords and kings attained the One and thus could bring balance and uprightness to the world.

Such is their attainment—
*attainment*: admonition.
Referring to the six matters above.

If heaven had nothing by which to be clear, it would fear splitting—
this means heaven must alternate between yin and yang, day and night; it cannot merely seek clarity without end, lest it split and cease to be heaven.
If earth had nothing by which to be stable, it would fear erupting—
this means earth must have high and low, hard and soft, seasonal qi and the five phases; it cannot merely seek stability without end, lest it erupt and cease to be earth.
If the spirits had nothing by which to be numinous, they would fear ceasing—
this means the spirits must have periods of waxing, waning, imprisonment, death, rest, and decline; they cannot merely seek numinous transformation without end, lest they become empty and cease to be spirits.
If the valleys had nothing by which to be full, they would fear drying up—
this means the valleys must have expansion and contraction, emptiness and fullness; they cannot merely seek fullness without end, lest they dry up and cease to be valleys.
If the myriad things had nothing by which to live, they would fear perishing—
this means all things must follow the seasons in life and death; they cannot merely seek long life without end, lest they perish and cease to be things.
If the lords and kings had nothing by which to be noble and exalted, they would fear stumbling—
this means the lords and kings must humble themselves to serve others, diligently seeking the worthy; they cannot merely seek to be noble and exalted without end, lest they stumble and lose their positions.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root—
this means if one desires honor and nobility, one must take humility and lowliness as the root, as Yu and Ji tilled the fields themselves, Shun made pottery by the river, and the Duke of Zhou visited humble dwellings.
The exalted takes the low as its foundation—
this means if one desires honor and nobility, one must take the low as the foundation, just as building a wall requires starting from the base to reach the heights; without a firm foundation below, it will later collapse.
Therefore, the lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—
*orphaned* and *widowed* signify solitude; *unworthy* signifies being unable to serve as the hub for the spokes.
Is this not taking the humble as the root?
This means that though the lords and kings are most noble, they can call themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy"—is this not taking the humble as the root? This is to enlighten others.
Is it not so!
An exclamation of admiration.

Thus, when one assembles the parts of a carriage—its spokes, wheels, hub, axle, and frame—there is no single part called "carriage"; only when combined does it become one. This illustrates how lords and kings do not claim honorific titles for themselves, and thus attain true nobility.

Do not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone.
*Gleaming* suggests rarity, *clattering* suggests abundance; jade is rare and thus prized, stone is plentiful and thus despised. This means one should not seek to be valued like jade or scorned like stone, but rather abide in the mean.

**Chapter Forty: Reversal**
Reversal is the movement of the Dao.
*Reversal* means returning to the root. The root is the source of the Dao’s movement, from which all things arise; to turn away from it is to perish.
Weakness is the function of the Dao.
Softness and weakness are what the Dao constantly employs, and thus it endures forever.

All things under heaven are born from Being,
All things arise from Heaven and Earth, which possess form and position—thus they are said to be born from Being.
Being is born from Nonbeing.
The numinous radiance of Heaven and Earth, the fluttering of insects and wriggling of creatures—all emerge from the Dao. The Dao has no form, thus it is said to be born from Nonbeing.
This speaks of the root prevailing over the flower, weakness prevailing over strength, and humility prevailing over fullness.

**Chapter Forty-One: Sameness and Difference**
When the highest scholar hears the Dao, they diligently practice it.
The highest scholar, upon hearing the Dao, exerts themselves strenuously to put it into practice.
When the middling scholar hears the Dao, they hold it as if it exists, as if it does not.
The middling scholar, upon hearing the Dao, cultivates themselves to attain longevity and governs the state to achieve great peace, embracing it joyfully. Yet when they retreat and encounter wealth, beauty, or honor, they are deluded by desire and lose it again.
When the lowest scholar hears the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.
The lowest scholar, greedy and full of desires, sees the Dao’s softness and calls it cowardice; sees its plainness and calls it vulgar. Thus, they laugh at it.
If it is not laughed at, it would not be worthy of being called the Dao.
If it were not scorned by the lowest scholar, it would not deserve the name of Dao.

Thus, established sayings declare:
*Established* means set forth. These sayings illustrate how one with the Dao should be, as in the following lines.
The Dao that is bright appears dim;
One who embodies the luminous Dao seems obscure, as if lacking perception.
The Dao that advances appears to retreat;
One who pursues the Dao seems to fall behind.
The Dao that is level appears uneven.
*Level* means even. One who embodies the great Dao does not distinguish themselves but seems to blend with the multitude.
The highest virtue resembles a valley;
One of the highest virtue resembles a deep valley, unashamed of filth and impurity.
The purest white appears sullied;
One of the greatest purity seems tainted, not seeking to display themselves.
The most expansive virtue appears insufficient;
One whose virtue is vast seems dull and inadequate.
Established virtue appears deficient;
One who cultivates virtue seems as if they could be depleted.
Unadorned truth appears tarnished;
One of unadorned truth seems as if their colors have faded and lost their brilliance.
The greatest square has no corners;
One of perfect integrity has no rigid edges.
The greatest vessel is slow to complete;
One of great capacity, like the Nine Tripods or ritual vessels, cannot be swiftly forged.
The greatest sound is scarcely heard;
The greatest sound, like thunder waiting for the right moment to strike, illustrates how one should cherish qi and minimize speech.
The greatest image has no form;
One who embodies the great image is plain and without adornment.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
The Dao is concealed, leaving no one able to name it.
Only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.
*Completing* means bringing to fruition. The Dao excels at endowing people with essence and qi, and bringing them to fulfillment.

**Chapter Forty-Two: Transformation of the Dao**
The Dao gives birth to the One,
The Dao causes what it generates to be unified.
The One gives birth to the Two,
The One gives rise to yin and yang.
The Two gives birth to the Three,
Yin and yang generate the harmonious, clear, and turbid qi, dividing into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.
The Three give birth to the myriad things.
Heaven, Earth, and Humanity together generate the myriad things. Heaven bestows, Earth transforms, and Humanity nurtures them.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
All things bear yin and face yang, turning their hearts toward the sun.
And blend their qi to attain harmony.
All things contain primordial qi, which enables their softness and harmony—like the chest containing organs, bones containing marrow, and plants having hollows through which qi flows, allowing them to endure.

What people despise are "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy," yet kings and lords use these as their titles.
*Orphaned*, *widowed*, and *unworthy* are inauspicious names, yet kings and lords adopt them to embody humility, modeling themselves on emptiness, softness, and harmony.
Thus, some things are diminished yet augmented,
When pulled, they cannot be drawn away; when pushed, they inevitably return.
Others are augmented yet diminished.
Those who seek to elevate themselves will collapse; those who covet wealth will invite disaster.

What people teach,
This refers to the common teaching of abandoning weakness for strength, and softness for rigidity.
I also teach them.
I teach people to abandon strength for weakness, and rigidity for softness.
The strong and violent do not meet a natural death.
The *strong and violent* are those who disbelieve in the profound and mysterious, rebel against the Dao and virtue, disregard scriptural teachings, and rely on power and force.
*Do not meet a natural death* means being cut off by Heaven’s decree, slain by weapons, or executed by royal law—dying without the fulfillment of their allotted lifespan.
I will take this as the father of my teaching.
*Father* means origin. Laozi uses the example of the strong and violent as the starting point for admonition.

**Chapter Forty-Three: Partial Use**
The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.
The softest is water; the hardest is metal and stone. Water can penetrate the firm and enter the rigid, flowing without obstruction.
That which has no substance enters where there is no gap.
*That which has no substance* refers to the Dao. The Dao has no form or substance, thus it can enter where there are no gaps, communicating with the numinous and aiding all beings.
Thus, I know the benefit of non-action.
I see how the Dao, through non-action, allows the myriad things to transform and complete themselves—thus I know the benefit of non-action for humanity.
Teaching without words,
Following the Dao’s example of not speaking, one teaches through embodiment.

**The Benefits of Non-Action**
The benefits of non-action—following the Dao’s non-action—govern the body to benefit the spirit, govern the state to benefit the myriad people, without wearisome toil.
Few under heaven attain this.
*Under heaven* refers to the ruler. Few can match the governance of body and state through the Dao’s non-action.

**Chapter Forty-Four: Establishing Admonitions**
Fame or the self—which is dearer?
When fame advances, the self retreats.
The self or wealth—which is greater?
When wealth accumulates, it harms the self.
Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
To covet gain is to sicken one’s conduct.
Excessive love incurs great cost:
Excessive love of beauty drains the spirit.
Excessive love of wealth invites misfortune.
What is loved is little; what is lost is much—hence, *great cost*.
Hoarding much ensures heavy loss.
In life, hoarding fills storehouses; in death, it fills tombs.
Living, one fears robbery and plunder; dead, one fears grave-robbers and coffin-thieves.
Knowing contentment avoids disgrace.
Those who know contentment sever profit and abandon desire, sparing themselves disgrace.
Knowing when to stop averts peril.
Knowing where to stop, wealth and profit do not burden the self, nor do sounds and sights disorder the ears and eyes—thus the self avoids danger.
This can endure long.
Those who know when to stop and when to be content hold fortune and blessing in themselves. In governing the body, the spirit is not wearied; in governing the state, the people are not disturbed—thus it may endure long.

**Chapter Forty-Five: Vast Virtue**
Great perfection seems flawed.
*Great perfection* refers to a ruler whose virtue and Dao are fully realized. *Seems flawed* means concealing fame and hiding merit, appearing broken and incomplete.
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
With such a mind, its use knows no end.
Great fullness seems empty.
*Great fullness* refers to a ruler whose virtue and Dao overflow. *Seems empty* means nobility does not breed arrogance, wealth does not breed extravagance.
Yet its use is boundless.
With such a mind, its use knows no limit.
Great straightness seems bent.
*Great straightness* means cultivating the Dao and upholding standards with unwavering integrity. *Seems bent* means not contending with the vulgar, appearing yielding.
Great skill seems clumsy.
*Great skill* refers to abundant talent and technique. *Seems clumsy* means not daring to display one’s abilities.
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
*Great eloquence* means wisdom without doubt. *Seems inarticulate* means speech without sophistry.
Stillness overcomes heat,
*Overcomes* means to the utmost.

In spring and summer, yang qi surges swiftly above, and the myriad things flourish in fullness. When fullness reaches its extreme, cold arrives, and cold brings withering and death. This teaches that one should not be rigid or restless.

Stillness overcomes heat. In autumn and winter, the myriad things rest in the yellow springs below. When stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises—heat is the source of life. Clarity and stillness can rectify all under heaven. If one can be clear and still, one becomes the enduring ruler of all under heaven. Maintaining integrity ensures no end.

**Chapter 46: Restraining Desires**
When all under heaven follows the Dao,
this means the ruler embodies the Dao.
Horses are retired to fertilize the fields.
*Fertilize* means to enrich the fields. Those who govern the state cease using weapons and chariots, returning horses to cultivate the land. Those who cultivate the self return yang essence to nourish their bodies.

When all under heaven abandons the Dao,
this means the ruler has lost the Dao.
Warhorses breed on the outskirts.
Warfare never ceases, and warhorses are born on the borders, never to return.

No sin is greater than indulging desire.
This refers to excessive lust.
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment.
Wealth and nobility cannot restrain themselves.
No fault is greater than covetousness.
Coveting others’ possessions is both greedy and grasping.

Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment
means guarding the root of truth.
Is always content.
It means having no desire.

**Chapter 47: Mirroring the Distant**
Without leaving the household, one knows all under heaven.
The sage knows all under heaven without leaving the household by understanding others through oneself and other families through one’s own. Thus, all under heaven is seen.

Without peering through the window, one perceives the Dao of heaven.
The Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity are one; heaven and humanity are interconnected, their qi flowing as one. When the ruler is clear and still, the qi of heaven naturally aligns. When the ruler is full of desires, the qi of heaven becomes turbid. Fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm—all arise from oneself.

The farther one goes, the less one knows.
This means leaving one’s home to observe others’ homes, departing from oneself to observe others. The farther one observes, the less one truly sees.

Thus, the sage knows without traveling,
the sage, without ascending to heaven or descending into the abyss, understands all under heaven through the heart.
Names without seeing.
When superiors favor the Dao, inferiors favor virtue; when superiors favor martial prowess, inferiors favor brute force. The sage infers the great from the small, perceives the external by examining the internal.
Accomplishes without acting.
When superiors do nothing, inferiors follow suit, households are provided for, and the people are content. The myriad things transform of their own accord.

**Chapter 48: Forgetting Knowledge**
Pursuing learning leads to daily increase.
*Learning* refers to the study of governance, teachings, rituals, and music. *Daily increase* means that emotions, desires, and embellishments grow more abundant each day.

Pursuing the Dao leads to daily diminishment.
*Dao* refers to the Dao of nature. *Daily diminishment* means that emotions, desires, and embellishments gradually fade away.

Diminish and further diminish,
*Diminish* means reducing desires. *Further diminish* means gradually eliminating them.
until one reaches non-action.
One should be as serene and uncontrived as an infant.
Then there is nothing that is not done.
When desires are severed and virtue merges with the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be applied, nothing that cannot be accomplished.

Governing all under heaven always relies on non-action.
*Governing* means to rule. To rule all under heaven, one must rely on non-action, not on toil and disturbance.
When one engages in action, it is insufficient to govern all under heaven.
When one favors action, governance becomes burdensome, the people are unsettled, and thus it is insufficient to rule all under heaven.

**Chapter 49: Entrusting Virtue**
The sage has no constant mind.
The sage values change and continuity, prizing compliance as if having no mind of his own.
He takes the minds of the people as his mind.
The sage follows what is convenient for the people’s minds.

The good, I treat as good.
When the people act virtuously, the sage treats them as good.
The not-good, I also treat as good.
Though some among the people may not be good, the sage transforms them to be good.
Thus, virtue is goodness.
When the people are morally transformed, the sage deems them good.

The trustworthy, I trust.
When the people are trustworthy, the sage trusts them.
The untrustworthy, I also trust.
When the people are untrustworthy, the sage transforms them to be trustworthy.
Thus, virtue is trust.
When the people are morally transformed, the sage deems them trustworthy.

The sage in all under heaven is cautious and reverent,
the sage in all under heaven is always cautious and fearful, never arrogant or extravagant in wealth and nobility.
and blends his mind for all under heaven.
This means the sage’s mind for all under heaven is as if muddled, appearing ignorant and unenlightened.

The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him.
*Fix* means to employ. The people all use their ears and eyes to serve the sage’s seeing and hearing.
The sage treats them all as children.
The sage cherishes the people as infants, nurturing them without expecting repayment.

**Chapter 50: Valuing Life**
Emerging into life, entering into death.
*Emerging into life* means desires arise from within, the hun-soul is tranquil, and the po-soul is settled—thus, life. *Entering into death* means desires lodge in the chest, essence is exhausted, and spirit is confused—thus, death.

Those who follow life number thirteen; those who follow death number thirteen.
This speaks of the categories of life and death, each numbering thirteen, referring to the nine orifices and four gates.

In life, the eyes do not recklessly see, the ears do not recklessly hear, the nose does not recklessly smell, the mouth does not recklessly speak, the tongue does not recklessly taste, the hands do not recklessly grasp, the feet do not recklessly walk, and the spirit is not recklessly expended.
In death, the opposite holds true.

People in life move toward the realm of death—thirteen in number.
Though people seek life, their actions lead them to the thirteen realms of death.
Why is this?
This asks why they move toward the realm of death.
Because they seek life too fervently.
The reason people move toward the realm of death is that their pursuit of life is too excessive, violating the Dao and opposing heaven, acting recklessly and losing discipline.

Yet I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life,
*nurturing* means cultivation,
walk the road without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers.
Naturally avoiding harm, they remain untouched by danger.

Entering the army without donning armor or weapons, disliking war and the killing of men. The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and weapons no place to lodge their blades. For those who cultivate life, rhinoceroses and tigers have no means to harm them, and blades have no way to strike them.

Why is this?
This asks why rhinoceroses, tigers, and weapons do not harm them.
Because they do not enter the realm of death.
Because they do not transgress the thirteen realms of death.
It is said that the spirit’s luminous protection guards them, so these things dare not harm them.

**Cultivating Virtue Fifty-First**
The Dao gives them life.
The Dao gives life to the ten thousand things.
Virtue nurtures them.
Virtue is the One. The One distributes qi and nurtures them.
It shapes their forms.
The One establishes the forms of the ten thousand things.
It completes them through conditions.
The One creates the conditions of cold and heat to perfect them.
Thus, the ten thousand things none fail to honor the Dao and treasure virtue.
What the Dao and virtue accomplish, the ten thousand things all respond to with reverence.
The Dao’s honor, virtue’s treasure—nothing commands them, yet they are always naturally so.
The Dao-One does not summon the ten thousand things, yet they always respond to it as naturally as an echo or shadow.

Thus, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, rears them, nourishes them, completes them, ripens them, shelters them, and covers them.
The Dao’s relation to the ten thousand things is not merely to give life but also to rear, nourish, complete, ripen, shelter, and protect, preserving their nature and destiny.
The ruler who governs the state and cultivates the self should do likewise.

It gives life yet does not possess,
The Dao gives life to the ten thousand things yet does not claim them for its own gain.
It acts yet does not rely,
The Dao’s actions do not depend on expectation of reward.
It rears yet does not dominate,
The Dao rears the ten thousand things yet does not control them for its own benefit.
This is called profound virtue.
The Dao’s benevolent power is dark and unseen.

**Returning to the Origin Fifty-Second**
The world has a beginning,
The beginning is the Dao.
Which is taken as the mother of the world.
The Dao is the mother of the ten thousand things under heaven.
Having known the mother, one also knows her child.
The child is the One. Having known the Dao, one should also know the One.
Having known the child, one again guards the mother.
Having known the One, one should again guard the Dao and return to non-action.
Thus, one’s body does not perish.
One remains free from danger.

Seal its apertures,
The apertures are the eyes. Let the eyes not recklessly see.
Close its gates,
The gates are the mouth. Let the mouth not recklessly speak.
And one’s life will not be exhausted.
If one seals the eyes from reckless seeing and closes the mouth from reckless speech, one’s life will not be worn out.
Open its apertures,
Open the eyes to desires.
And further its affairs,
Further the affairs of desire.
And one’s life will be beyond saving.
Disaster and chaos will arise.

Seeing the small is called clarity,
The first stirrings of misfortune, before harm appears, are small; to perceive them alone is clarity.
Guarding the soft is called strength.
To guard softness is to grow daily in strength.
Use its light,
Use the light of the eyes to observe the world’s advantages and harms.
And return to its clarity.
Return the light inward, lest the spirit leak away.
Do not leave the body to calamity,
Inward vision preserves the spirit, preventing loss.
This is called practicing the eternal.
To practice this is to cultivate the constant Dao.

**Adding Evidence Fifty-Third**
If I were suddenly granted knowledge, I would walk the great Dao.
*Jie* means great. Laozi laments that the rulers of his time do not walk the great Dao, so he speaks thus: If I were suddenly granted knowledge of governance, I would walk the great Dao, personally practicing the transformation of non-action.
Only action is to be feared.
Only to act is to be feared, lest one lose the Dao’s intent.
Desiring to reward goodness, one fears false goodness will arise;
Desiring to trust loyalty, one fears false loyalty will appear.
The great Dao is level,
Level means smooth and easy.
Yet the people prefer byways.
Byways are crooked and not upright. The great Dao is smooth and easy, yet the people prefer crooked paths.
The court is excessively adorned,
High towers and pavilions, palaces and halls are refined.
The fields are excessively overgrown,
Agriculture is abandoned, and the land is not cultivated.
The granaries are excessively empty,
The five grains are damaged, and the state has no reserves.
They wear embroidered silks,
They delight in adornment and value outward splendor.

They gird themselves with sharp swords, prizing hardness and strength, martial and extravagant. They surfeit on food and drink, hoard wealth in excess, indulge in many desires, never satisfied. This is called "robber’s arrogance."

When the common people are impoverished while the ruler abounds in surplus, it is because he plunders and robs to adorn himself, parading his ostentation before others, unaware that his own death and family’s ruin will soon follow, with kin and kindred swept away with him. Such "robber’s arrogance" is not the Dao. When a ruler acts thus, this is not the Dao. The phrase "also, alas!" expresses deep sorrow.

**Cultivating Observation (Chapter 54)**
What is well established cannot be uprooted.
To establish means to erect. One who skillfully founds self and state upon the Dao cannot be pulled away or uprooted.
What is well embraced cannot be loosed.
One who skillfully embraces the spirit with the Dao can never be torn away or released.
Descendants’ sacrifices will not cease.
For descendants who cultivate the Dao thus, long life and immortality endure through generations, and ancestral sacrifices in the ancestral temple never end.

Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true.
Cultivating the Dao in the self—cherishing qi and nurturing the spirit—prolongs life and extends years. Such virtue is that of a true person.
Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.
Cultivating the Dao in the family—father kind, son filial; elder brother friendly, younger brother respectful; husband faithful, wife chaste—brings surplus blessings to descendants in future generations.
Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring.
Cultivating the Dao in the village—honoring elders, nurturing the young, instructing the ignorant—ensures that no one is left unprotected.
Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful.
Cultivating the Dao in the state—ruler trustworthy, ministers loyal; benevolence and righteousness arise spontaneously; ritual and music flourish naturally; governance is impartial and selfless—yields virtue that is rich and full.
Cultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.
When the ruler cultivates the Dao throughout the world, transformation occurs without words, order without instruction; the response of the people to their superior is as swift as echo follows sound. Such virtue is all-pervading.

Thus, observe the self through the self.
Observe the unrefined self through the self that cultivates the Dao—who perishes, who endures?
Observe the family through the family.
Observe the unrefined family through the family that cultivates the Dao.
Observe the village through the village.
Observe the unrefined village through the village that cultivates the Dao.
Observe the state through the state.
Observe the unrefined state through the state that cultivates the Dao.
Observe the world through the world.
Observe the unrefined ruler through the ruler who cultivates the Dao.
How do I know the world is thus? By this.
Laozi says: How do I know that those who cultivate the Dao prosper while those who turn from it perish? I observe and know this through these five matters.

**Mysterious Sign (Chapter 55)**
One whose virtue is profoundly embraced
Refers to one who deeply holds virtue within.
is like an infant.
The numinous protection of such a person is as parents’ care for an infant.
Poisonous insects do not sting,
Bees, scorpions, snakes, and vipers do not sting.

Fierce beasts do not seize, birds of prey do not strike.
The infant harms no creature, and no creature harms the infant.
Thus in an age of Great Peace, whether noble or base, all possess a heart of benevolence.
Things with thorns revert to their root; creatures with venom do not harm humanity.
Bones weak, sinews soft, yet the grasp is firm.
The infant’s sinews and bones are soft and weak, yet its hold is steadfast—its intent is single, its heart unwavering.
Not knowing the union of male and female, yet the organ stirs to utmost vigor.
The infant knows not the coupling of man and woman, yet its yang energy surges—this arises from the abundance of its essence and qi.
Crying all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of harmony.
From dawn to dusk, the infant’s wailing voice remains unchanged—this comes from the abundance of harmonious qi.
To know harmony is to know constancy.
One who knows the harmonious and yielding qi that benefits others knows the constancy of the Dao.
To know constancy is to be enlightened.
One who knows the constancy of the Dao daily deepens in clarity and penetrates the mysterious.
Pursuing life brings ominous growth.
"Ominous" means prolonged. To pursue life and indulge in self-preservation is to daily expand in excess.
The heart directs qi to daily strength.
The heart should remain focused, harmonious, and yielding, with spirit and qi filling the interior—thus the form remains supple.
Yet if one acts recklessly, harmony departs from within, and the body daily hardens.
When things reach their prime, they age.
All things that reach their peak wither and grow old.
This is called "not-Dao."
To wither and age is to lose the Dao.
What is not-Dao perishes early.

**Mysterious Virtue (Chapter 56)**
The wise do not speak.
The wise value action over words.
Those who speak are not wise.
A team of horses cannot overtake the tongue—much speech brings many troubles.
Block the apertures, close the gates.
To block and close is to sever the source.
Blunt the sharpness.
When desires and passions drive one to sharp action, one should contemplate the Dao’s non-action to temper and restrain them.
Untie the tangles.
"Tangles" are knots of resentment that never cease. One should contemplate the Dao’s tranquility to dissolve them.
Harmonize the light.
Though possessing unique insight and clarity, one should harmonize it to dim its brilliance, lest it dazzle and confuse others.
Blend with the dust.
One should not set oneself apart.
This is called "mysterious sameness."
"Mysterious" is Heaven. One who practices these things above is said to align with Heaven’s Dao.
Thus one cannot be drawn near,
Not delighting in honor, not grieving in solitude.
Nor kept at a distance.
With a still mind and no desires, one bears no grudges.
One cannot be benefited,
Not seeking wealth or fine flavors.
Nor harmed.
Not contending for profit with the greedy, nor for pride with the fierce.
One cannot be exalted,
Not serving as a ruler in chaotic times, nor holding office under a benighted lord.
Nor debased.
Not growing arrogant with power, nor bending in defeat.
Thus one is honored by the world.
With such virtue, even the Son of Heaven cannot make one a subject, nor feudal lords bend one’s will.
Moving with the world, preserving oneself, and avoiding harm, one is honored by all under Heaven.

**Pure Wind (Chapter 57)**
Govern the state with uprightness.
"With" means "to the utmost." Heaven appoints those of upright character to rule states.
Deploy troops with cunning.
"Cunning" is deception. Heaven appoints those skilled in deceit to command armies.
Win the world through non-action.
Heaven appoints those who practice non-action to become lords of the world.
How do I know this is so? By this.
"This" refers to the present. Laozi says: How do I know Heaven’s will is thus? By what I observe today.
The more taboos in the world, the poorer the people.
"The world" refers to the ruler. "Taboos" are prohibitions. Excessive restrictions breed deceit below, and the people grow poorer as they exhaust themselves in evasion.
The more sharp tools the people possess, the more the state descends into chaos.
"Sharp tools" are powers. When the people wield many powers, the eyes of observers grow dazzled, the ears of listeners confused, and ruler and subject grow estranged—thus the state falls into disorder.
The more people cultivate cleverness, the more strange things arise.
"People" refers to rulers and local lords. "Cultivate cleverness" means adorning palaces, carving and painting robes and regalia. As strange things proliferate, those below emulate those above, embellishing gold, engraving jade, and embroidering with ever more lavish colors.
The more laws and fine objects are displayed, the more thieves and bandits appear.
"Fine objects" are prized possessions.

When rare and prized objects proliferate and grow conspicuous, agricultural work is abandoned, hunger and cold arrive together, and thieves and bandits multiply. Thus the sage declares: this concerns the affairs of those below. "I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves." The sage says: I cultivate the Dao and align with Heaven, introducing no alterations or contrivances, and the people naturally achieve transformation. "I favor stillness, and the people rectify themselves." The sage says: I favor stillness, neither speaking nor instructing, and the people naturally become loyal and upright. "I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves." I impose no corvée labor or conscription, so the people remain secure in their occupations and thus all grow wealthy. "I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity." I constantly have no desires, discard ornate patterns, and diminish adornments, so the people follow me in embracing plainness.

[I have no passions, and the people purify themselves." The sage says: I cultivate the Dao and preserve authenticity, cutting off the six passions, and the people naturally follow me in attaining purity.]

**Chapter 58: Following Transformation**

When governance is dull and unobtrusive,
its policies and teachings are lenient and broad, dull and obscure, seemingly unclear.
Its people are honest and sincere,
for lenient governance fosters richness and prosperity, and the people grow close and harmonious.

When governance is sharp and exacting,
its policies and teachings are hasty and severe, decisions made by word of mouth, judgments by ear.
Its people are lacking and deficient.
Under hasty governance, the people cannot sustain themselves, growing ever more distant and thin.

Misfortune is where fortune leans,
"Leans" means "depends upon." For fortune arises from misfortune: when people encounter misfortune and can repent, examine themselves, cultivate the Dao, and perform good deeds, then misfortune departs and fortune arrives.
Fortune is where misfortune lies concealed.
Misfortune hides within fortune: when people obtain fortune and grow arrogant and indulgent, then fortune departs and misfortune arrives.
Who knows its ultimate end?
Misfortune and fortune give rise to one another—who can know when their cycle will reach its limit?
There is no constancy.

A ruler who does not rectify himself will lose his state.
When rectitude becomes perverse,
"Perverse" means "deceitful." If the ruler is not rectified, even when those below are rectified, they will transform to follow the ruler’s deceit.
When goodness becomes ominous,
Good people will all transform to follow the ruler’s ominous omens.
The people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.
This speaks of how the ruler’s delusion and loss of rectitude have persisted for a long time.

Thus the sage is square but does not cut,
The sage acts with square integrity to lead those below, not to sever or harm them.
Sharp but does not injure,
"Injure" means "to wound." The sage acts with sharp clarity to transform the people, not to wound them.
Now it is otherwise: one rectifies oneself only to harm others.
Straight but not unrestrained,
"Unrestrained" means "to extend." Though the sage is straight, he bends himself to follow others and does not impose his own will.
Radiant but not dazzling.
Though the sage possesses unique insight, he remains as if dim, not using his brilliance to confuse others.

**Guarding the Dao (Chapter 59)**
In governing the people,
This refers to the ruler governing the people.
And serving Heaven,
"Serving" means "to employ." One should employ the Way of Heaven and follow the four seasons.
Nothing compares to frugality.
"Frugality" means "to cherish." Those who govern the state should cherish the people’s resources and not indulge in extravagance. Those who cultivate themselves should cherish their essence and qi, not allowing dissipation.
For frugality is called "early attainment."
"Early" means "prior," and "attainment" means "to obtain." By cherishing the people’s resources and one’s essence and qi, one can first obtain the Way of Heaven.
"Early attainment" is called "accumulating virtue in abundance."
To first obtain the Way of Heaven is to accumulate virtue abundantly within oneself.
Accumulating virtue in abundance leads to invincibility,
"Invincibility" means "to overcome." By accumulating virtue abundantly within oneself, there is nothing one cannot overcome.
Invincibility means none can know its limit,
When there is nothing one cannot overcome, none can know the limit of one’s virtue.
And none knowing its limit means one can possess the state.
When none can know the limit of one’s virtue, one can possess the altars of soil and grain and bring blessings to the people.
Possessing the mother of the state ensures long duration.
State and self are the same. "Mother" is the Dao. If one can preserve the Dao within oneself, ensuring that essence and qi are not exhausted and the five spirits are not harmed, then one can endure long.
This is called "deep roots and firm stem,"
One should take qi as the root and essence as the stem. Just as a tree with shallow roots is uprooted and fruit with a weak stem falls, one should deeply store one’s qi and firmly guard one’s essence, allowing no leakage.
The Way of long life and enduring vision.

**Holding Office (Chapter 60)**
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
"Small fish" refers to fish. When cooking a small fish, one does not remove its entrails or scales, nor dares to stir it, for fear of breaking it apart. Governing a state with excessive meddling causes disorder below; cultivating oneself with excessive meddling scatters one’s essence.
When the Dao is applied to the world, its ghosts do not act as spirits.
When one governs the world with virtue and the Dao, ghosts dare not use their spiritual power to harm people.
It is not that its ghosts lack spirit, but that their spirit does not harm people.
It is not that the ghosts lack spiritual power, but that they cannot harm those who are in accord with nature.
It is not that their spirit does not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm them.
It is not that ghosts and spirits cannot harm people. Because the sage in office does not harm people, ghosts dare not interfere.
When the two do not harm each other,
Ghosts and the sage both refrain from harming one another.
Virtue thus converges upon them.
When the two do not harm each other, people are governed by the yang, ghosts by the yin; people preserve their lives, and ghosts preserve their spirits. Thus virtue converges upon them.

**The Virtue of Humility (Chapter 61)**
A great state is the lower reaches of the stream...

A great state governing should be like the rivers and seas dwelling in the lower reaches, not opposing the subtle and small. The convergence of all under heaven—
A great state is where the scholars and people of all under heaven gather.
The female of all under heaven.
The female belongs to the yin kind. Gentle, humble, and harmonious, she does not contend.
The female always overcomes the male with stillness; the woman can subdue the man, yin overcomes yang, because she is tranquil and does not seek precedence.
With stillness she takes the lower place.
The Way of yin takes tranquility and humility as its foundation.
Thus when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state.
By being humble and lowly, it constantly possesses it.
When a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state.
This means that regardless of size, if a state maintains humility and nurtures others, it will be without fault.
Thus some humble themselves to win, while others are humbled and win.
"Humble themselves" refers to a great state lowering itself before a small state, or a small state lowering itself before a great state, each winning the other through righteousness.
A great state desires nothing more than to nurture and embrace others.
If a great state does not lose its humility, it can annex and govern small states.
A small state desires nothing more than to serve others,
to act as a subject or servant.
When both attain what they desire, the greater should be the more humble.
When great and small states each seek their own desires, the great state should still be humble and lowly.

**The Dao as the Treasure (Chapter 62)**
The Dao is the hidden sanctuary of the ten thousand things.
"Hidden" means to conceal. The Dao conceals the ten thousand things, encompassing all without exclusion.
It is the treasure of the good,
the good regard the Dao as the treasure of their persons, never daring to transgress it.
and the refuge of the not-good.
The Dao is what the not-good rely upon.
When calamity strikes or urgency arises, they still know to repent and humble themselves.
Fine words can be traded in the marketplace.
Fine words alone can be exchanged in the marketplace. In market transactions, people part ways without mutual affection; buyers seek quick acquisition, sellers quick sale.
Noble conduct can elevate a person.
"Elevate" means to distinguish. One with noble and esteemed conduct can be set apart from ordinary people, though this is not yet sufficient to honor the Dao.
Why should those who are not good be abandoned?
Even if people are not good, they should be transformed by the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people; virtue and transformation were pure.
Thus the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed,
to teach and transform those who are not good.
Though one may offer a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses,
it is not as good as presenting this Dao while seated.
Though one may arrive with a fine jade disk preceding a team of four horses, it is still not as good as quietly presenting this Dao.
Why was this Dao valued by the ancients?
Why did the ancients not daily seek it afar but find it near at hand?
Can it be that through it, those with transgressions may be absolved?
"Those with transgressions" refers to those who suffer in chaotic times, when benighted rulers recklessly impose corporal punishments. Cultivating the Dao can dissolve death and exempt one from the multitude.
Thus it is honored throughout all under heaven.
The Dao is vast and far-reaching, covering and aiding all without exception. It preserves the body and governs the state, tranquil and without action—thus it is honored throughout all under heaven.

**Beginning with Grace (Chapter 63)**
Act without acting,

Following the natural course, one makes no forced creations.
Handle affairs as if handling no affairs—anticipate with preparation, eliminating vexations and simplifying matters.
Savor the flavorless.
Through deep contemplation and far-reaching foresight, one savors the meaning of the Dao.
Address the great and small, the many and few—
this is to set forth warnings and commands.
Desiring greatness, one returns to smallness; desiring abundance, one returns to scarcity—such is the natural Dao.
Repay resentment with virtue.
Cultivating the Dao and practicing goodness severs misfortune before it arises.
Plan for difficulty while it is still easy.
To plan for difficult matters, act when they are easy, before they take shape.
Achieve greatness from the minute.
To accomplish great things, begin with the small, for calamity and disorder arise from minor origins.
The difficult affairs of the world must begin with the easy; the great affairs of the world must begin with the minute.
From the easy, difficulty arises; from the minute, the conspicuous emerges.
Thus the sage never attempts greatness, and so achieves greatness.
Abiding in humility, all under heaven come to him.
Light promises surely lack trust—
for words are not weighed.
Much ease surely brings much difficulty—
for dangers are not guarded against.
Thus the sage treats all as difficult,
moving with caution in action and decision, ever mindful of difficulty, seeking to close its source.
Therefore, in the end, there is no difficulty.
The sage remains free from misfortune and hardship throughout life, ever deeply avoiding harm.

**Guarding the Minute (Chapter 64)**
What is secure is easily maintained;
governing the body and the state in tranquility is easily preserved.
What shows no sign is easily planned for;
when passions, desires, and misfortunes have yet to manifest, they are easily forestalled.
What is brittle is easily broken;
when disorder has not yet stirred in the court and desires have not yet shown in countenance, they are as fragile and easily dispelled.
What is minute is easily scattered;
before it becomes evident, the small is easily dispersed.
Act before it exists—
to accomplish anything, block its inception when it is but a bud.
Govern before disorder arises—
governing body and state before chaos begins, one should preemptively close its gate.
A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tender shoot;
from smallness, greatness arises.
A nine-tiered terrace rises from mounded earth;
from lowliness, height is established.
A journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath the feet—
from nearness, distance is reached.
Those who act ruin it;
acting in affairs, one abandons the natural; acting in righteousness, one abandons benevolence; acting in desire, one abandons the spirit.
Those who grasp lose it.
Grasping at profit invites calamity; grasping the Dao preserves the body, yet clinging without yielding brings reversal.
Thus the sage practices non-action and so suffers no ruin,
for the sage does not pursue ornate embellishments, sensual pleasures, or harmful excesses.
Practices non-grasping and so suffers no loss,
for the sage possesses virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor, holding nothing in reserve, and so loses nothing to others.
The people in their undertakings commonly fail when near completion.
"Undertakings" mean actions. The people in their affairs, when merit and virtue are nearly complete, often ruin themselves through craving rank, seeking fame, and indulging in excess and fullness.
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no ruined affairs.
The end should be like the beginning—one must not grow lax.
Thus the sage desires what others do not desire.
The sage desires what others do not: others desire display, the sage desires hidden brilliance; others desire adornment, the sage desires simplicity; others desire sensuality, the sage desires virtue.
Does not value rare and precious goods;
the sage is not dazzled by fine attire, nor does he despise stone while prizing jade.
Learns what others do not learn.
The sage learns what others cannot: others learn cunning and deceit, the sage learns the natural; others learn to govern the world, the sage learns to govern the self—thus preserving the true Dao.
Returns to what the multitude has passed over;
the multitude in their learning reverses priorities, taking the root for the branch, the substance for the ornament.
To "return" is to revert to the root.
Assists the naturalness of the myriad things.
Teaching people to return to the root and substance is to aid the natural essence of all things.
Yet dares not act.
The sage moves in accord with the natural course, daring not force creation, fearing to stray from the root.

**Pure Virtue (Chapter 65)**
Of old, those skilled in the Dao did not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.
Those of old who were adept in the Dao, whether governing body or state, did not use the Dao to teach the people cleverness and deceit but instead instructed them in virtue and simplicity, fostering honesty and eschewing pretense.
The people are difficult to govern because of their cunning.
The people are hard to govern because their cleverness leads to deceit and artifice.
Thus to govern the state with cleverness is to be a thief of the state;
if those with intelligence govern the state’s affairs, they will stray from the Dao, wantonly wielding power and profit, becoming thieves of the state.
To govern the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing.
If those with intelligence are not employed to govern the state’s affairs, the people will uphold integrity, avoid false adornments, and foster harmony between ruler and subject, becoming the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two is also a model.
These two refer to the clever and the un-clever. Consistently, the clever become thieves, while the un-clever bring blessing—this is the model for governing body and state.
Consistently knowing this model is called profound virtue.
"Profound" means heavenly. To know the model for governing body and state is to share the virtue of heaven.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching,
the person of profound virtue is unfathomably deep, unattainably distant.
and turns back from things!
The person of profound virtue differs from the myriad things: while all things seek to benefit themselves, the person of profound virtue bestows upon others.
Only then does one attain great compliance.
Profound virtue, differing from the myriad things, thus achieves great compliance—
compliance with the principles of heaven.

**Putting Oneself Last (Chapter 66)**

The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel at placing themselves below—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. The rivers and seas, being lowly, draw all streams to them, just as the people turn to their king. By being lowly, they become kings of the hundred valleys.

Therefore, one who wishes to be above the people must, in speech, place oneself below them—following the rivers and seas in their humility. One who wishes to lead the people must, in conduct, place oneself behind them—putting others first and oneself last.

Thus the sage, though above the people, is not a burden to them. Though ahead of the people, they are not a harm to them. Therefore the world delights in exalting them without wearying. Because they do not contend, no one in the world can contend with them.

**The Three Treasures (Chapter 67)**

The world all says my Dao is great, yet it seems unrefined. Precisely because it is great, it appears unrefined—had it been refined, it would long since have been petty. Those who are discerning and clever have long been thus: their loftiness and self-regard, their exacting governance, have endured for ages. How trivial they are!

I possess three treasures, which I hold and preserve:
The first is compassion,
the second is frugality,
the third is not daring to be first in the world.

Compassion makes one courageous,
frugality makes one expansive,
and not daring to be first in the world makes one the vessel of the world.

Compassion—thus one can be brave.
Frugality—thus one can be generous.
Not daring to be first—thus one can become the leader of the world.

Thus one becomes the vessel of leadership. To become the vessel of leadership is to be a person of the Dao. I am able to be the leader of those who attain the Dao.

Now, if one abandons compassion and yet seeks courage,
if the people of this age forsake benevolence and pursue only martial valor;
if one abandons frugality and yet seeks expansiveness,
if they forsake restraint and pursue only extravagance;
if one abandons deference and yet seeks precedence,
if they forsake putting others first and strive only to be first—
this is death! Such conduct leads straight to destruction.

For with compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.
With benevolence, the people draw near and unite in purpose—thus one prevails in war and holds fast in defense.
Heaven will save them, shielding them with compassion.
When Heaven aids the virtuous, it bestows the nature of compassion, enabling them to protect themselves.

**Matching Heaven (Chapter 68)**

The true warrior is not martial,
for they value virtue and power over brute force.
The true strategist is not wrathful,
for one who wages war with the Dao restrains evil in the heart and severs calamity before it sprouts, needing no cause for anger.
The true victor does not contend,
for one who conquers with the Dao draws near with benevolence and summons the distant with virtue, never clashing with the enemy yet bringing them to submission.
The true leader humbles themselves before others,
for one who skillfully employs others always maintains a posture of modesty and deference.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
for to place oneself below others is the power of not contending.
This is called harnessing the strength of others,
for to humble oneself is to employ the force of those who serve.
This is called matching Heaven, the ultimate principle of antiquity,
for one who embodies this aligns their virtue with Heaven—this is the supreme Dao of the ancients.

**Mysterious Application (Chapter 69)**

There is a saying in warfare:
Laozi detested the wars of his time, so he framed this teaching in his own voice.
"I dare not act as the host but rather as the guest,"
for the host initiates, and I dare not strike first.
The guest responds without provocation—
one should act only in accord with Heaven.
"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot,"
for invading another’s land and seizing their wealth is advancement,
while closing the gates and defending the city is retreat.
This is called marching without formation,
for when the enemy persists in plunder, becoming a scourge upon the world, even in punishing them, one does so without order.
Raising arms without arms,
for though one may rage, it is as if no arm can be raised.
Grasping without weapons,
for though one may seize, it is as if no enemy remains to be seized,
wielding no blade.
Why? To spare the people from suffering under a ruler who defies the Dao, enduring the agony of loss.
No calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,
for the greatest harm in warfare comes from belittling the foe, ceaselessly encroaching, waging war with greed.
To underestimate the enemy is to nearly forfeit my treasure—
"nearly" means drawing close, and "treasure" refers to one’s life.
To belittle the enemy is to court the loss of one’s own being.
Thus when opposing armies clash,
the side that grieves will prevail,
for grief is compassion, and soldiers do not shrink from death.

**Knowing Difficulty (Chapter 70)**

My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.
Laozi says: My teachings are concise and easy to understand, simple and easy to follow.
Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them,
for people despise softness and favor rigidity.
My words have a source, my affairs have a lord.
My teachings stem from a fundamental origin, and my deeds follow a proper order. If people do not understand, it is not due to any failing in my virtue—it is their hearts that oppose mine.
Only through ignorance do they not know me.
Only because the people are ignorant is my virtue obscured, unseen externally, profound and subtle—hence their lack of understanding.
Those who know me are few, and thus I am esteemed.
"Few" means rare. Only those who grasp the Dao can truly know me, and so I am held in high regard.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within,
for the coarse cloth is humble outwardly, while the jade represents inner richness—concealing treasure, hiding virtue, never displaying it to others.

**Knowing Illness (Chapter 71)**

To know yet seem not to know is supreme,
for to recognize the Dao yet speak as if ignorant is the height of virtue.
Not to know yet claim to know is illness.
To be ignorant of the Dao yet assert knowledge is a flaw in virtue.
Only by recognizing this illness as illness does one avoid illness.
Only by perceiving the affliction of others’ forced knowing can one avoid such affliction oneself.
The sage is free from illness because they recognize illness as illness—thus they remain free from illness.
The sage suffers no such affliction of forced knowing, for they constantly lament that others bear this illness, rejecting such folly—hence they do not afflict themselves.
The sage embraces penetrating wisdom yet appears ignorant,
wishing to guide the world toward simplicity, loyalty, and integrity, each preserving their pure nature.
The petty person, not grasping the Dao’s intent, recklessly engages in forced knowing to display brilliance, inwardly depleting their spirit, shortening their years.

**Cherishing the Self (Chapter 72)**

When the people do not fear authority, great authority will descend.
"Authority" means harm. If people do not fear minor harm, major harm will come—
and the greatest harm is death.
Those who fear it should cherish their spirit, aligning with Heaven and Earth.
Do not encroach upon your dwelling,
for the heart dwells in the spirit—it should be spacious and gentle, not cramped and harsh.
Do not weary your source of life,
for life arises from the spirit. Entrust yourself to emptiness, delight in stillness, regulate your diet, dismiss thoughts of desire and beauty, and banish perversity from your heart—these erode the root and exhaust the spirit.
Only one who does not weary the spirit will not be wearied,
for only one who never exhausts their spirit—purifying the heart, washing away filth, embracing tranquility and desirelessness—will find the spirit dwelling within, unwearied.
Thus the sage knows themselves but does not display themselves,
understanding their own gains and losses yet never parading their virtue outwardly, concealing it within.

The self-loving do not exalt themselves.
To love oneself is to preserve one’s essence and qi, not to seek lofty renown in the world.
Thus, abandon that and embrace this—
abandon self-display and self-exaltation, embrace self-knowledge and self-love.

**Chapter Seventy-Three**
To be bold in daring is to court death;
boldness in reckless action brings destruction to the self.
To be bold in restraint is to preserve life;
boldness in restraint brings life to the self.
These two—
daring and restraint—
bring either benefit or harm:
preserving life is benefit, destroying it is harm.
What Heaven abhors—
it abhors reckless action.
Who knows the reason?
Who can fathom Heaven’s intent and not transgress?
Thus even the sage finds this difficult.
If the sage’s luminous virtue still struggles with reckless boldness,
how much more so for those lacking such virtue?

The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory;
Heaven does not vie with humanity over honor or disgrace, yet people naturally revere it.
It does not speak yet excels in response;
Heaven does not speak, yet the myriad things move in accord with the seasons.
It does not summon yet things come of themselves;
Heaven does not call, yet all things turn toward the sun, bearing yin within.
Vast and unhurried, it excels in planning.
Vast and expansive, Heaven’s Dao, though boundless, skillfully governs human affairs—
rewarding good and punishing evil, each receiving its due.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
loose yet never failing.
Though its mesh is broad, it oversees the good and evil of all, missing nothing.

**Chapter Seventy-Four**
When the people do not fear death,
how can death be used to frighten them?
When rulers impose cruel punishments, leaving the people with no means to live,
they cease to fear death.
Those who cultivate the self, indulging in desires that harm the spirit or coveting wealth that destroys the body,
do not know what to fear.
Why then threaten them with death?
If rulers do not relax their harsh laws and teach the people to abandon passions and desires,
how can they use death to intimidate?
If the people were made to constantly fear death,
one should first remove the causes of oppression and instruct them to forsake greed.
Yet those who act perversely,
we seize and execute—
who would dare?
If, after teaching the Dao, the people still disobey and instead engage in strange and cunning acts,
then by royal law they are seized and killed—who would dare transgress?
Laozi laments that the rulers of his time did not first employ moral transformation but instead resorted to punishment.

There is always one who oversees killing—
this overseer is Heaven, which from on high observes human transgressions.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
loose yet never failing.
To take the place of this overseer
is like a clumsy man trying to wield the master carpenter’s adze.
Heaven’s Dao is supremely clear, its oversight of killing constant—
like the cycles of spring growth, summer flourishing, autumn harvest, and winter storage,
or the turning of the Dipper’s handle, all governed by measure.
If a ruler seeks to usurp this role,
it is as if an unskilled laborer tried to replace the master carpenter—
toiling in vain.
For one who takes the place of the master carpenter,
rarely do they avoid injuring their own hands.
If a ruler enacts punishments,
it is like the clumsy man wielding the adze—
the square and circle are never true,
and harm returns to the wielder.
Those who usurp Heaven’s role in killing
lose the proper order,
and in failing to uphold it, bring calamity upon themselves.

**Chapter Seventy-Five**
The people’s hunger
stems from their rulers consuming too much in taxes—
this is why they starve.
The people suffer cold and hunger because their rulers exact excessive taxes,
leading them to emulate such greed, rebel against the Dao, and violate virtue.

The people are difficult to govern
because their rulers are meddlesome—
this is why they are difficult to govern.
The people become unruly because their rulers are full of desires and fond of action,
so the people follow suit, their deceit and falsity making them hard to rule.

The people treat death lightly
because their rulers pursue life too lavishly—
seeking excessive gain, they endanger themselves.
Thus they court death.
For those who do not make life their sole pursuit
are wiser than those who prize it.
Only those who do not make life their primary concern—
whose minds are untouched by rank and emolument,
whose bodies remain free of wealth and profit,
whom neither the Son of Heaven can enslave nor the feudal lords command—
are wiser than those who cling to life.

**Chapter Seventy-Six**
In life, humans are supple and weak,
for they embody harmonious qi and embrace the spirit—
thus they are soft and yielding.
In death, they become rigid and strong,
for their harmonious qi is exhausted and their spirit departed—
thus they are hard and stiff.

The myriad things and plants in life are tender and fragile,
for their harmonious qi remains.
In death, they wither and dry,
for their harmonious qi has gone.
Thus the rigid and strong belong to death,
the soft and weak belong to life.
From these two observations,
we know that the rigid and strong lead to death,
while the soft and weak lead to life.

Therefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail;
mighty armies, eager for battle and fond of slaughter, spread poison and breed resentment—
the weak unite against the strong, so they do not win.
When trees are strong, they are felled.
A robust trunk invites branches and leaves to grow upon it.
The strong and great occupy the lowly place,
while the soft and weak rise above.
In the workings of creation, great trees lie below,
while smaller things ascend—
Heaven’s Dao humbles the strong and uplifts the weak, a natural principle.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven**
The Dao of Heaven—
is it not like the drawing of a bow?
Heaven’s Dao is obscure, so we use familiar things as metaphors.
The high is pressed down, the low is lifted,
the excessive is reduced, the deficient is replenished.
This is how the bow is tuned to be serviceable—
pressing down the high, lifting the low,
diminishing the strong, and aiding the weak—
such is the Dao of Heaven.

The Dao of Heaven reduces the excessive to supplement the deficient.
Heaven’s Dao diminishes the full to benefit the humble,
always valuing harmony and balance.
The Dao of humanity is not so—
it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Human ways reverse Heaven’s Dao:
the world’s people take from the poor to enrich the wealthy,
seizing from the weak to strengthen the powerful.
Who can have abundance and offer it to the world?
Only those who follow the Dao.

Who can occupy a position of abundance and, reflecting on their rank and emoluments, offer them to the world’s deficient? Only a ruler who follows the Dao can do so. Thus the sage acts without claiming credit, bestows virtue without expecting repayment. Their work is accomplished, yet they do not dwell in its achievement. Having completed their task, they do not cling to their position. They do not wish their worthiness to be seen, concealing their merit and refusing honor, for they fear Heaven’s reduction of the excessive.

**Chapter 78**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet in a round vessel it becomes round, in a square vessel square;
dammed, it stops; released, it flows.
Yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the hard and strong—
water can wear away mountains and flood hills,
grind iron and dissolve bronze,
achieving what nothing else can.
For there is nothing that can replace it.
Nothing can replace water in overcoming the hard and strong.
The weak overcomes the strong—
water extinguishes fire, yin dissolves yang.
The soft overcomes the hard—
the tongue is soft, the teeth are hard, yet the teeth perish before the tongue.
All in the world know this:
that the soft and weak endure, while the hard and strong break.
Yet none can put it into practice—
ashamed of humility, they prefer arrogance and force.
Thus the sage declares:
To humble oneself is to serve.
To bear the nation’s disgrace is to be lord of the altars of soil and grain—
a ruler who can endure the nation’s filth, like rivers and seas receiving every stream, will long preserve their state and become its sovereign.
To bear the nation’s misfortune is to be king of all under Heaven—
a ruler who takes blame upon themselves and bears calamity in place of the people may rule the world.
Straight words seem reversed—
these are words of truth, yet the world does not understand and takes them as perverse.

**Chapter 79**
To reconcile great resentment,
one who kills is put to death, one who injures is punished—this is mutual requital.
Yet resentment will remain,
for legal punishment fails to address human feeling, and lingering bitterness may fall upon the innocent.
How can this be called good?
If one acts thus, they oppose Heaven’s heart—how can this reconcile resentment as good?
Thus the sage holds the left tally and does not demand from others.
In ancient times, the sage held the left tally, matching tokens as a pledge.
Without written laws, they carved tallies to serve as trust,
relying on the tally alone, not imposing other demands.
The virtuous oversee the tally—
a ruler of virtue examines only the tally’s agreement.
The unvirtuous oversee transgressions—
a ruler without virtue betrays their pledge and scrutinizes others’ faults.
Heaven’s Dao is impartial, yet it always favors the good.
Heaven’s Dao has no partiality, but it aligns with the good—just as one who oversees the tally does.

**Chapter 80**
A small state with few people...

Though the sage governs a great state, they regard it as small, practicing frugality and restraint without extravagance. Though the people are many, they treat them as few, never daring to burden them. They ensure the people possess tools for ten or a hundred households yet do not employ them—meaning the implements of farmers—so as not to conscript or deprive them of their proper seasons. They cause the people to value life and not wander far. When the ruler works for the people’s benefit and removes their harms, each finds their place, and the people cherish life and cling to their homes. When government decrees are not onerous, the people remain content in their occupations and do not migrate far from their accustomed dwellings.

Though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them. Through clarity and non-action, they do not indulge in extravagance or delight in travel and amusement. Though there are armor and weapons, they have no occasion to array them, for there is no resentment or enmity in the world. They cause the people to return to knotting cords for record-keeping, casting aside ornament to return to simplicity, so that trust is without deceit.

They find their food sweet—content with coarse fare, not plundering the people’s livelihood. They find their clothing fine—pleased with plain garments, not prizing the five colors. They find their dwellings secure—at ease in thatched huts, not admiring ornate houses. They delight in their customs—rejoicing in their unadorned ways, never altering them. Neighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the distance, yet the people grow old and die without ever traveling between them, for they have no restless desires.

**Chapter 81**
Truthful words are not beautiful—
truth is as it is, unadorned and plain.
Beautiful words are not truthful—
fine speech is embellished rhetoric, hollow and false.

The good do not argue—
the good cultivate the Dao and do not adorn themselves with ornament.
Those who argue are not good—
clever speech brings disaster upon the tongue.

A mountain holds jade, yet men dig into the mountain;
a river holds pearls, yet men muddy its depths—
glib tongues and many words bring ruin to the self.

The wise are not broadly learned—
the wise are those who know the Dao, guarding the One and the origin.
The broadly learned are not wise—
those with vast knowledge lose the essential and the true.

The sage does not accumulate—
the sage accumulates virtue, not wealth, using virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor.
Having acted for others, they themselves possess more—
having extended virtue and transformation to others, their own virtue grows.
Having given to others, they themselves have more—
having distributed wealth and goods to others, their own wealth increases like the light of the sun and moon, never exhausted.

The Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm—
Heaven gives life to the ten thousand things, nurturing and raising them, never causing injury.
The Dao of the sage acts and does not contend—
the sage follows Heaven’s example in their deeds, bringing affairs to completion without competing for merit or fame, thus preserving their sagely work in full.
