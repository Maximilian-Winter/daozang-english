**Preface to the *Catalogue of Ancient Alchemical Scriptures* in *The Essential Compendium of Great Achievement* (First Volume)**

The Dao is fundamentally one principle, yet its methods divide into the Three Origins: the Celestial Origin, the Terrestrial Origin, and the Human Origin. The nine grades of alchemical traditions align with three levels of accomplishment: initial attainment, intermediate attainment, and supreme attainment.

When the Three Origins are discussed separately, the Celestial Origin is called the *Great Elixir*, the Terrestrial Origin the *Divine Elixir*, and the Human Origin the *Golden Elixir*. When considered together, initial attainment is called the *Golden Elixir*, intermediate attainment the *Divine Elixir*, and supreme attainment the *Great Elixir*. Thus, all Three Origins bear the names *Great Elixir*, *Divine Elixir*, and *Golden Elixir*.

In the Celestial Origin, one fulfills destiny and completes life. In the Terrestrial Origin, one captures cinnabar and refines mercury. In the Human Origin, one practices "transplanting flowers and grafting trees." In initial attainment, one lays the foundation in a hundred days. In intermediate attainment, one nurtures the embryo for ten months. In supreme attainment, one nurses the infant for three years.

Yet in the Celestial Origin, the crux of the Elixir lies not beyond the mutual containment of "his lead" and "my mercury," seizing the celestial treasure of interdependent concealment. In truth, all are but the union of one yin and one yang, blended and refined to achieve transformation.

Though these Three Origins of the Elixir share the same principle, their methods differ, and their applications vary greatly. Yet among those who cultivate the true Dao, most know only one aspect and remain ignorant of the others. Even those who can distinguish the schools and truly grasp one path are as rare as one in ten thousand.

I have observed those who have heard of the *Great Elixir* of the Celestial Origin and attained the Dao through it; they recognize only the supremacy of the Celestial Origin and remain unaware of the profound mysteries of the Terrestrial and Human Origins. Those who have heard of the *Divine Elixir* of the Terrestrial Origin and ascended through its ingestion know only the supremacy of the Terrestrial Origin and remain ignorant of the subtleties of the Celestial and Human Origins. Those who have heard of the *Golden Elixir* of the Human Origin are often unaware of the essential teachings of the Celestial and Terrestrial Origins.

Some revere the Human Origin, elevating it as the *Golden Liquid*, while dismissing the Celestial Origin as the *Jade Liquid*, unaware that the Human Origin is but the initial vehicle for extending life, the Celestial Origin the supreme vehicle for refining destiny, and the Terrestrial Origin the intermediate vehicle for ingesting elixirs.

Alas! Consider the ancients: Xu Shiyang, the Perfected Lord, heard of the *Divine Elixir* of the Terrestrial Origin and also the *Great Elixir* of the Celestial Origin. Ge Yachuan, the Perfected One, heard of the *Divine Elixir* of the Terrestrial Origin and also the *Golden Elixir* of the Human Origin. Lü Chunyang and Zhang Sanfeng heard of the Human Origin and also the Celestial and Terrestrial Origins. As for the Five Southern Patriarchs, they all completed the Dao through the *Golden Elixir* of the Human Origin. The Seven Northern Perfected Ones all ascended through the *Great Elixir* of the Celestial Origin. Yet the *Divine Elixir* of the Terrestrial Origin remains unheard of.

Those who venerate Buddhism know only recitation and chanting. Those who honor the sages know only to cultivate ethics and uphold norms. Yet if one can focus single-mindedly, one can attain subtlety. If one can be utterly sincere, one can align with the heart of Heaven. As long as one can gather and preserve that single spark of true nature and numinous light, it will not fade into oblivion. Thus, those who wholeheartedly recite the Buddha’s name may transcend to the Pure Land. Those who sincerely cultivate ethics may leave a fragrant legacy for centuries. All the immortal masters and Daoist patriarchs of past ages transmitted scriptures, expounded methods, established teachings, and bequeathed instructions, each with their own profound insights, which cannot be reduced to a single path. It falls to the diligent student to silently refine and ponder, grasping their essential meaning.

Some texts focus on a single Origin, while others encompass all Three Origins. Among those that address all Three, some emphasize the Human Origin, others the Terrestrial Origin—one cannot generalize.

Works such as the *Heart Method of the Golden Elixir*, *The Pointers of Nature and Life*, *The Celestial Immortal’s Lower Principles*, *The Union of Immortals and Buddhas*, *The Verification of the Golden Immortal*, and the *Sutra of the Wise Life* specifically address the *Great Elixir* of the Celestial Origin, speaking of pure cultivation and enlightenment.

Works such as the *True Transmission of the Golden Elixir*, *Elegant Words to Awaken the Dao*, *The Essential Chapter*, and the *Song of Knocking on the Junction* specifically address the *Golden Elixir* of the Human Origin, speaking of yin-yang refinement.

Works such as the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons*, the *Great Clarity Scripture of the Elixir*, the *True Formulae of the Terrestrial Origin*, the *Record of Upholding the Will*, and the *Fisherman’s Lodge Record* specifically address the *Divine Elixir* of the Terrestrial Origin, speaking of lead and cinnabar refinement.

The *Dao De Jing* and the *Scripture of Yin Convergence* encompass all Three Origins. The *Awakening to Reality* and the *Token for the Agreement of the Three* also address all Three Origins but emphasize the Human Origin. The *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* and the *Stone Casket Record* likewise address all Three Origins but emphasize the Terrestrial Origin.

May future sages and perfected ones who attain the great Dao upon seeing this discourse understand that the Three Origins, though distinct in method, share a single principle, and thus avoid the sigh of one who gazes at the ocean in vain.

Know that while alchemical scriptures and Daoist texts may fill libraries to the rafters, apart from this duality of principle and unity of the primordial Dao, all else belongs to the ninety-six heterodox paths and two thousand six hundred secondary schools. No matter how elaborate, they ultimately fail to connect with the great Dao.

As the Buddhists say: *"Only this one matter is true; all else is not."* This "one matter" refers to the original true self of our primal yang nature—our inherent, formless, and non-empty luminous and enlightened essence.

The Buddhists call it *"true emptiness and right awakening."*
The Daoists call it *"the spirit that is not spirit."*

Thus, the means by which one severs the cycle of birth and death lies entirely in the fulfillment of nature and life. The *Golden Elixir* of the Human Origin is the foundation for extending life. The *Divine Elixir* of the Terrestrial Origin is the path of elixir ingestion. Yet the *Great Elixir* of the Celestial Origin is the complete embodiment and great function of dual cultivation of nature and life.

Now, moved by compassion for later learners, I shall clarify the meaning of the scriptures and present the dual-path Great Dao and the alchemical classics transmitted by the immortal and buddha patriarchs of past generations, clearly distinguishing and listing them below. May the benevolent and virtuous gentlemen of the world, those with aspiration for this Dao who encounter a true teacher, diligently compare ancient and modern sources, verifying consistency from beginning to end, so as not to fall into heterodox schools.

Moreover, this collection allows scholars, in their study of past and present, to grasp the author’s original intent at a glance and discern which lineage a work belongs to. Thus, the profound and the shallow stand clearly apart, truth and falsehood are instantly distinguished, and one’s direction becomes certain. Following this path without deviation, one shall never be misled by heretical teachings or deviant doctrines.

This serves as the preface.

**Genealogy of Daoist Lineages**

Since the primordial chaos first parted, the Five Elders governed the world. The Daoist Patriarch presided over heaven and earth, appearing in every age without fail. The Confucian lineage upheld the moral order, transmitted from generation to generation. The Buddha Patriarch roamed the Western Paradise, manifesting through countless kalpas.

Only the Daoist Patriarch, radiant with golden and mysterious light, reigned over Kunlun, propagating the subtle Daoist teachings, governing the five phases, nurturing the upright qi of the Two Modes, and shaping the perfected immortals of the Primordial Unity. Since the separation of chaos, these matters cannot be generalized.

At first, the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao at Mount Kongtong, where Guangchengzi instructed him in the Way, enabling him to ride a dragon and ascend. By the late Zhou dynasty, the Most High Lord Lao descended through kalpas to the world, transforming Confucianism and Buddhism, and transmitting the Dao to Yin Xi. Thus, he became the founder of the Three Teachings and the master of all perfected beings.

Later, in the Eastern Han dynasty, the Queen Mother of the West secretly bestowed upon Wang Xuanfu of Qingzhou the *Taiji Bagua* (Eight Trigrams of the Supreme Ultimate) as revealed by Fuxi, the sacred texts of the primordial state, and the esoteric principles of the Great Elixir for restoring nature and fulfilling life, as transmitted by Lord Lao. After Wang attained the Dao, the Queen Mother bestowed upon him the title *Donghua Emperor Lord*. With profound vows, the Emperor Lord sought to widely open the gateway to the Dao and perpetuate its lineage. Thus, in the Yongshou era of Emperor Huan (Dingyou year), he transmitted the Dao to the Patriarch of True Yang, Zhongli Quan.

By the second year of the Tianshou era of Empress Wu Zetian in the Tang dynasty, the Patriarch of True Yang transmitted the Dao to the Patriarch of Pure Yang, Lü Dongbin, when Lü was sixty-four years old. After serving his master for seven years, he first heard the Dao. By the thirteenth year of the Xiantong era, he had attained the Dao.

Later, in the Xinwei year of the Qianhua era of Emperor Taizu of the Later Liang during the Five Dynasties period, the Patriarch of True Yang also delivered the Dao to Liu Cao, the prime minister of the Yan state, who was given the name *Haichanzi*. At that time, Liu was also sixty-four years old. After serving his master for five years, he first heard the Dao at sixty-nine and attained it in his seventies. He later resided at Mount Qingcheng and styled himself *Qingcheng Hermit*. He then delivered the Dao to Zhang Boduan at the age of eighty-three, who took the Daoist name *Ziyang*. As he founded the Southern Lineage, he became known as one of the *Five Southern Patriarchs*. Shi Xinglin, Xue Zixian, Chen Niyuan, Bai Yuchan, and Peng Helin were among his most eminent disciples.

In the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty, Lü Dongbin and Haichanzi, along with the *Clothed-in-Hemp* Master, wandered to Mount Hua, where they encountered Chen Tuan and learned the *Hibernating Dragon* method. From this, they transmitted the profound mechanism of spirit projection, and Lü ultimately sat in meditation and transcended the world.

As for the *Seven Northern Perfected*, in the thirty-third year of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song (Jimao year), the two patriarchs, Zhong and Lü, together arrived at Ganhe Town in Zhongnan. There, they delivered the Primordial Great Dao to the Patriarch of Heavy Yang, Wang Zhe, and bestowed upon him the teachings. After the transmission was complete, they suddenly saw seven golden lotuses blooming and bearing fruit in the eastern sky. When Wang asked the reason, the patriarchs smiled and said, "Not only seven golden lotuses—there will be ten thousand jade lotus chambers in the future."

Later, during the Qiandao era of Emperor Xiaozong, the Patriarch of Heavy Yang transmitted the Dao to Ma Danyang, Sun Bu’er, Qiu Chuji, Wang Chuyi, Liu Chuxuan, Tan Chuduan, and Hao Datong, fulfilling the omen of the seven golden lotuses. Among these Seven Perfected, only Patriarch Qiu widely opened the gateway of universal deliverance, leading countless disciples to attain the Great Dao. The emperor bestowed upon him the title *Celestial Immortal Top Graduate*. Patriarch Ma also propagated the transformation of the *True One*.

Thus, in the Gengwu year of the Shaoxi era of Emperor Guangzong, he transmitted the Dao to Song Piyun, Li Dacheng, Zhao Penglai, and Han Qingpu. After these four attained the Dao, only Ning Piyun was able to perpetuate the heart transmission and styled himself *Yellow Chamber Elder*. During the reign of Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan dynasty, he journeyed west to Shu and transmitted the Dao to Li Taixu. Li Taixu then transmitted it to Zhang Ziqiung, who in turn passed it to Zhao Yuanfu. In the Jisi year of the Tianli era of Emperor Mingzong of the Yuan dynasty, Zhao delivered the Dao to Chen Zhixu of Luling, whose courtesy name was Guanwu and whose Daoist name was *Shangyangzi*.

After hearing the Dao, Chen sought to refine it but lacked resources. He traveled far and wide in search of those with karmic affinity. When he journeyed to the southwestern region of Yue, the indigenous people forcibly demanded the Dao from him but failed to obtain it. They intoxicated him with wine, placed him in a drum, and cast him into the great ocean. This alarmed the Heavenly Consort, who commanded the sea gods to protect him. They conveyed him to the southern shore, where he was rescued from the water by Tian Hou, who had been sent to offer sacrifices to the Heavenly Consort. Upon learning of his ordeal, Tian Hou brought him back to the capital, provided him with financial support, and enabled him to attain the Dao and achieve perfection.

Reflecting on his survival from the water drum, Chen realized that Heaven had spared him to transmit the Dao. Thus, he traveled extensively to seek those with karmic affinity, widely opening the gateway to the Dao. Among his disciples, over twenty transcended the mundane and entered sagehood. By the Guiwei year of Emperor Shundi of the late Yuan dynasty, his reputation reached the emperor, who issued a decree summoning him. Foreseeing the end of the dynasty’s fortune, the Perfected One first manifested transformation and vanished into the *Spiritual Wilderness*.

The above records the transmission lineage of Patriarch Ma Danyang.

The lineage thus halted and was not transmitted further.

In the first year of Emperor Renzong’s Yan-you reign of the Yuan dynasty, there was Zhang Sanfeng, who sought the Dao and explored the mysteries. For nearly thirty years, he encountered no one, his efforts in vain, his life in constant anxiety. Never did he meet a perfected being to fulfill his lifelong aspiration. He then journeyed west to Qin and Long, drawing in the qi of Mount Taihua and absorbing the marvels of Mount Taibai. Passing through Baoxie, crossing Chen-cang, he saw the lakes and marshes of Baoji Mountain—secluded, serene, and elegant—and so took residence at Jintai Abbey. Lamenting the rarity of hearing the supreme Dao, he burned incense day and night to petition Heaven, seeking divine aid for the Way. At the age of sixty-seven, he was moved when Huo, a disciple of the venerable Chen Tuan, transmitted to him the supreme Dao along with the external elixir of furnace and fire, enabling him to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.

By the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty, there was the Tiger-Skin-Seated Perfected One, Zhang Jingxu, who sought the Dao at Biyang Cave in western Shu. There, he encountered Qiu Changchun, the Patriarch of Fuyang, who transmitted the supreme Dao. Zhang remained in the cave to cultivate and attain perfection. The Patriarch then commanded the Perfected One to descend the mountain and reopen the gateway of universal salvation. The Perfected One traversed the ends of the earth, seeking those with karmic affinity, yet by the *Jimao* year of the Wanli reign, he had only saved Li Xu’an. Later, in the *Dinghai* year of Wanli, the Perfected One saved the brothers Cao Huanyang. Huanyang, in turn, saved Wu Chongxu in the *Jiazi* year of Wanli. Chongxu was the fourth-generation disciple of Patriarch Qiu of the Dragon Gate lineage. After attaining the Dao, he composed works such as *The True Principles of Heavenly Immortals* and *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*. Thus, this Dao flourished alongside the Ming dynasty.

By the fifth year of Emperor Yongzheng’s reign in the Qing dynasty, the Chan Master Jixu appeared in the world, inheriting the true transmission of Patriarch Qiu and propagating the mystic wind within the Buddhist gate. During the Qianlong era, there was Chan Master Huayang, who encountered the second-generation master Chongxu and followed his path, ensuring the perpetuation of the transmission. He authored *The Verification of Golden Immortals* and *The Scripture of the Wisdom-Life*, which circulated in the world. Spreading to the present day, the teaching has reached both China and the barbarian lands, and those who have transcended the mundane and entered sagehood by following these scriptures are beyond count. This fulfills the omen of the ten thousand-petaled jade lotus chamber.

Moreover, the Perfected Lord Xu Jingyang of the Jin dynasty had once sealed a prophecy, stating that after fourteen hundred years, three thousand heavenly immortals and eight hundred earthly immortals would emerge. One should observe the spiritual vein of immortals and Buddhas flowing in the sands of the Yuzhang River—this is the appointed time. (This sealed prophecy originates from the *Precious Seal of Longsha*. The names of the eight hundred earthly immortals were already inscribed on the stone stele of Master Cui’s hall, with Liu Qiaoyang as their foremost.)

A children’s rhyme says:
*"At the mouth of the Yuzhang River’s sands,
Immortals walk the streets in bands."*

Now, the time has come to pass. In the Yuzhang River, a sandbar has appeared, named Xinzhougan. Though the salvation of the deluded multitudes is a rare encounter across ten thousand kalpas, there remains the fear of failing to distinguish jade from stone, of reaping karmic fruits not sown. Thus, this is a propitious moment in the great kalpic cycle. Yet, dragons and snakes may still intermingle, and one will see the heterodox and the orthodox each establishing their own schools, composing works to circulate in the world. The true and the false will both transmit the Dao, setting up altars to expound teachings and save others.

Some cling to the root of the mountain as the mysterious pass, unaware that the mysterious pass is but a wondrous metaphor for the arising of being from non-being. Without refining true yang, one will inevitably return to emptiness and perish. Others, coveting the arts of *cai-zhan*, seek the "female crucible," ignorant that the female crucible is a profound mechanism for "offering borrowed flowers to the Buddha." Without gaining from others, one first loses what is one’s own. And there are reckless swindlers who exploit the furnace and fire to ensnare others in fraud.

Minor arts for curing illness—those who study *daoyin* and diligently practice *tuna*—all belong to external paths, too numerous to enumerate in full, and are but side doors, impossible to exhaustively describe. How can they compare to the study of fulfilling destiny through the primordial, which fundamentally opposes our fellowship’s work of preserving principle and cultivating *qi*? Those truly committed to authentic cultivation and realization must carefully examine, clearly discern, and fix their direction accordingly.

From the Supreme Lao, I received the Great Dao of Wuji, transmitted by Master Jingjue, along with the mind-seal and oral instructions, the sacred texts of the primordial. Yet lacking the means and companions, I could not engage in secluded refinement. Moreover, bound by the burdens of parents and livelihood, I could not fully enter this Way. Fearing the Great Dao would lose its true transmission, and thus fail to repay my master’s nurturing grace, I reverently commit these profound principles and oral instructions to bamboo and silk, revealing to my disciples the hunger and thirst of half a lifetime. May scholars and literati of this age use this book to attain sagehood, and may future generations of Buddhist disciples and immortal seeds rely on my words to ascend to truth. Then I, too, shall have no small glory.

Thus, I compose this book and leave behind a record, writing:

*I urge you not to worry of finding no kindred spirits—*
*There are always those of like mind and shared virtue.*
*Stand firm as a pillar in the rushing current,*
*And what fear is there that a lone tree will not become a forest?*
*When the time comes, wind and clouds shall gather;*
*When fortune turns, how could there be no dragon and tiger’s roar?*
*See how the haze clears and the sky brightens—*
*A single red sun illuminates heaven and earth.*

**Principles and Essentials of Cultivating Both Nature and Destiny: Mind-Seal, Oral Instructions, Secret Teachings, and Sacred Texts**

The Confucian teaching holds three aspirations for true cultivation:
*The scholar aspires to worthiness, the worthy to sagehood, the sage to Heaven.*

The Buddhist teaching holds three refuges and great precepts:
*Refuge in the Sangha, refuge in the Dharma, refuge in the Buddha.*
The Daoist teaching holds three refinements of true practice:
*Essence refines qi, qi refines spirit, spirit refines the Void.*

Now, the initial stage of the Dao’s practice—refining essence to transform qi—is called *Lesser Achievement: Laying the Foundation.* To dispel illness, reverse aging, prolong life, and restore youthful countenance, one must undertake the hundred-day work of laying the foundation. Clarifying five matters ensures a precise beginning, while discerning six signs allows flawless circulation. Regulating primordial essence to refine the external elixir relies on the subtleties of wind and fire, civil and martial. Gathering the true seed to refine the lesser elixir depends on the mystery of the Zhou Tian fire talisman. When fire is sufficient and the elixir potent, the tortoise-head retracts, and the cinnabar radiates a halo of light. With intent focused and the gaze fixed, the six roots tremble, and the five dragons bear the sacred. Penetrating the three barriers, traversing the nine orifices, one forever attains the indestructible vajra body. Ascending the Qian cauldron, descending the Kun furnace, one is destined to become a person of eternal youth. This hundred-day work of laying the foundation returns one to the unbroken original state, the harmonious union of Qian and Kun, known as the *Human Immortal.*

Yu Hua Zi says: The next stage—refining qi to transform spirit—is called *Intermediate Achievement: Nurturing the Embryo.* To foresee the future, avoid misfortune, establish merit, and glorify one’s ancestors, one must undertake the ten-month work of nurturing the embryo. Following the seven meditations to return to quiescence, aligning with the six mechanisms to realize perfect comprehension, guarding the center and embracing the One serves as the core of embryo nurturance. Progressing day and night without pause, responding in movement and storing in stillness, this is the divine mechanism of elixir refinement. From beginning to end, at every moment, one must neither forget nor force, nurturing with unbroken continuity, warming with constant stability and illumination. Then, true qi ascends, sweet dew descends, circulating the Zhou Tian of Mao and You to gather the internal elixir. Dividing left and right in ascent and descent, one secures the embryo’s origin. At times, the elixir’s light blooms like a lotus, its petals unfolding until golden flowers drift beyond the cauldron. At others, the infant marvels in perfect roundness, or the tortoise and serpent coil in embrace. Immortals and buddhas may come to pay homage, or central qi may suffuse the body with radiance. The thunder spirit may manifest its power to oversee the altar, or heavenly paradises may appear to entice, their jade palaces and celestial gardens everywhere. Hellish visions may arise to startle, with demonic faces and ghostly heads emerging in endless strangeness. Yet one must know that the golden elixir’s transformations—whether real or illusory—all demand the death of the heart to perceptions. Only when lead and mercury are exhausted, the two qi cease, and the wheel halts, with yang growing and yin waning, the six pulses returning as sun and moon conjoin, will hunger and thirst vanish forever. Qi transforms into pure yang, the body withstands cold and heat, and drowsiness disappears, while the elixir’s light remains constant. The heart attains sagely comprehension, and through the perfection of extinction, the mind empties and nature manifests. Spirit possesses the six penetrations, qi fills the two poles, golden lotuses burst from the earth, and white clouds drift across the sky. Gathering the true fire of samadhi, refining the hundred meetings of the Qian cauldron, thunder rumbles and shakes open the inner courtyard of the Purple Palace. Lightning flashes and flickers, guiding the yang spirit in emergence from samadhi. The immortal infant is born beyond the mortal frame, golden light coalesces within the dharma body—only then has one crossed the sea of suffering, truly ascending the other shore. This ten-month work of nurturing the embryo returns one to the original face of Qian, the true self’s rightful place, known as the *Earthly Immortal.*

The Perfected Lord says: The final stage—refining spirit to return to the Void—is called *Greater Achievement: Nursing the Infant.* To transcend the mundane and enter sageliness, to become an immortal or buddha, to weave the warp and weft of heaven and earth, and to assist in creation’s work, one must undertake the three-year work of nursing the infant. This requires refining spirit to return to the Void, mastering exit from being and entry into non-being. To complete the six-by-six work of nursing, one must understand the seven-by-seven way of preservation. Aligning with the yang light’s gathering and release, one regulates the spirit’s exit and entry. When the yang spirit emerges, movement is primary—brief rather than prolonged, advancing rather than retreating. When the yang spirit enters, stillness is paramount—enduring rather than fleeting, distant rather than near. The practice must progress from brief to enduring, its effects from advancing to retreating. The deeper the stillness, the more steadfast the yang spirit and the brighter the wisdom light. The more refined the practice, the more agile the yang spirit and the more wondrous its transformations. After three years of accomplishment, the nature’s essence matures. When regulating the spirit to exit the shell, the yang spirit takes the great Void as its dwelling, and the vast earth’s mountains and rivers become one’s household and gardens, places for roaming and repose. When gathering it back in samadhi, the yang spirit takes the physical body as its chamber, the inner courtyard and central palace as one’s bed and seat, places for rest and ease. Then, with a single step, one traverses a thousand miles, journeying through ten thousand lands. True emptiness and wondrous being allow concealment or manifestation at will. One traverses heaven and earth, strides the sun and moon, enters water without drowning, fire without burning, metal and stone without obstruction—indeed, there is nowhere one cannot enter and find freedom. Yin and yang cannot mold one, yet one can mold yin and yang. The five phases cannot alter one, yet one can alter the five phases. Yama cannot decree one’s death, Indra cannot control one’s life. One moves freely, enters and exits at will. Should one wish to remain in the world, one soars on clouds and ascends with one’s dwelling. Whether in the dust or beyond it, one can aid the world and benefit beings, assist the upright and dispel the perverse, relieve drought and floods, avert disasters and calamities. One may expound wondrous sutras, composing ten thousand verses daily to propagate the Dao, or establish teachings to guide all beings, passing on the lamp.

Wherever one acts, all is imbued with divine responsiveness and unfathomable transformation. Even ten million billion emanations, filling the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, remain boundless and infinite—this is the season of fulfillment for the great person, the day of accomplishment and renown. At such a juncture in life, how could one not rejoice? Through three years of nurturing effort, one has returned to the unyielding firmness of the original nature, attaining the station of unfathomable spiritual transformation—this is what is called a *divine immortal*.

Master Yin the Perfected says: I observe that in the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, many immortals transcended from this very point, departing through *corpse liberation*. Yet while their spirit was wondrous, their form was not—unable to merge with the boundless. Though their names were inscribed in the registers of immortality, roaming freely in grotto-heavens, they lacked the final touch: the work of refining emptiness to unite with the Dao. There remains a subtle instability, preventing ultimate perfection.

I now expound the secret treasury of a thousand buddhas, the supreme *Mind Seal of the Myriad Abilities*, the final touch and greatest consummation—this is the fruit of nine years of wall-gazing. One has returned to the station of *Nirvana without Remainder*, the *Golden Immortal of Great Awakening*. Such insight surpasses all other immortals. The detailed explanation follows in the latter volume; here, I will not repeat it.

People of the world, unaware of how to align with this mechanism, engage with affairs and things. They squander their spirit in pursuit of worldly dust, exhaust their sinews and bones to the point of decrepitude, and ultimately fall ill and die, plunging into the cycle of rebirth. All are submerged in the bitter sea, having utterly lost the path of awakening. Thus, one must seize this mechanism, fanning the flame and tempering the fire, harmonizing the primordial essence to nurture the true seed, circulating the *Zhou Tian* to magnify the elixir, and cultivating the *qi*-mother to eternally guard the lower *dantian*. This is the work of preserving principle and nurturing *qi*—a practice transmitted heart-to-heart, mouth-to-mouth by ancient sages, buddhas, and immortal masters, never to be lightly disclosed to the unworthy. Yet now, it is fully revealed in this book.

Confucius said: *"Those who understand me will do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals; *those who condemn me will do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals."* The compilation of this book is no different.

**On the Verification of Returning and Attainment**

The method of *Seven Returns and Nine Cycles* begins with directing the true yin of the upper aperture (the *original spirit* within *Li*) into the inner golden crucible of the *qi*-cavity, where it unites with the true yang of the lower aperture (the *original qi* within *Kan*). With *qi* nurturing spirit, spirit and *qi* merge as one, continuous and dense. Preserving the *wu* (original spirit) while guarding the *you* (original *qi*), the mechanism gradually transforms. Through prolonged *sitting in forgetfulness*, *fetal breathing* is formed. Once *fetal breathing* stabilizes, respiration ceases, and the true seed is born.

Daily, like a couple in intimate union, one experiences blissful harmony—yet one must not become attached. Water and fire naturally achieve balance; the tortoise and snake naturally intertwine. The true *qi* circulates through the four limbs, penetrating the hundred bones, steaming like a rising flame. This is the moment when the *true yang ancestral wrap* traverses the *Three Passes* and permeates the *Nine Apertures*. The key is to balance water and fire—neither excess nor deficiency. Too much fire harms the elixir; too little, and the elixir will not form. This is the *fire timing* of the *Small Celestial Cycle*.

When harmonized properly, the breath naturally reverses into the *original sea*, and the external yang retracts into the abdomen, while the true fire surges upward. The entire body is suffused with boundless bliss, the abdomen alive as a moving dragon. The true *qi* ascends and descends, manifesting dozens of transformations daily. The *infant* and *maiden* naturally unite—this is the stage of *gathering yin to supplement yang*.

Refining the *jade fluid returning elixir* within one’s body requires *laying the foundation* and *cultivating the self*. Accumulating one’s inherent *dharma wealth*, one abides in perpetual ease, luminous day and night—this is the initial step toward longevity and eternal existence. It is nothing more than *qi* fullness, *essence* abundance, and the harmony of spirit and *qi*.

I exhort those with the aspiration to cultivate the Dao: earnestly seek a lineage master, humbly request the *Mind Seal* and oral instructions, and penetrate the two layers of true celestial mechanism within and without. The *inner celestial mechanism* arises from the *Kun* furnace; the *outer celestial mechanism* emerges from the *Qian* crucible. Once understood, proceed swiftly with cultivation, refining the self while awaiting the moment. When laying the foundation, the *yang* arises beneath the *Nine Earths*; after forming the elixir, the *yang* arises above the *Nine Heavens*.

Choose a secluded chamber, far from human traces, where the sounds of roosters and dogs cannot reach, to refine this *Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir*. Externally, one must have a trusted fellow practitioner for support, avoiding all idle distractions lest the original spirit be startled and scattered. The ancients said: *"The moment of connecting life is precisely the moment of harming it."*

Earlier, I spoke of *blending light and harmonizing with the dust*—why now speak of secluded dwelling? Refining the self amidst worldly dust enables one to forget emotion when facing circumstances; nurturing *qi* in the mountains and forests is the work of *refining emptiness to unite with the Dao*. Know that transcending the mundane to enter sagehood is the rarest of great matters in the world. One must be unstained by a single speck of dust, empty of all thoughts, unburdened by the slightest attachment, cutting cleanly and forever becoming an outsider to the world, never harboring desires for the mortal realm. With unwavering resolve, forget the form and self, uphold emptiness to refine spirit. The entire body—viscera, bones, flesh, blood, and vessels—transforms into azure *qi*, penetrating metal and stone without obstruction.

At this stage, the *Seven Apertures* radiate light, luminous day and night. The heart is still as water; the body, vast as the cosmos. Only then is *qi* full and spirit complete, *dharma wealth* abundant. Now one may refine the *Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir* to seize the celestial mechanism beyond the body.

Begin by subduing the tiger with the dragon, then drive the tiger to join the dragon. If one can gather and concentrate without missing the timing, the gold from the *sea bottom* is drawn up, piercing the *tailbone*, ascending the *spine*, and reaching the *mud pill*. There, it transforms into *golden liquid*, descending the *tower of many stories* to enter the *Crystal Palace*, where it unites with the lead and mercury within one’s body. In less than half a moment, the gathering is complete, and the true fire surges into the four limbs. The entire body—bones and flesh—feels as if scorched by fire and sliced by blades, a sensation most difficult to endure.

Even the staunchest hero, at this stage, has not a shred of control. Though this be so, one must clench the teeth, steady the resolve, endure what others cannot endure, do what others cannot do—forsaking life and forgetting death—to bear this momentary suffering and gain a hundred million years of bliss. Guard against recklessness, weigh the dangers, and purify body and mind. When lead and mercury unite and water and fire merge, in an instant, every bone joint and aperture in the body bursts open like roasting beans, all at once. The entire body, bloodless, begins to speak. A tumult arises within the flesh.

Beneath the tongue lie two cavities: the left is the *Cinnabar Well*, the right the *Stone Spring*—this is the *Lianquan* point. As the bone channels burst open together, heart-fire descends and kidney-water surges upward. At this stage of practice, the numinous fluid beneath the tongue flows like an external spring, ceaselessly swallowing and absorbing day and night, its flavor far surpassing sugar and honey. Yet there is something even more wondrous: at the very moment of tending the furnace and beginning the work, the earth yields its golden lotus, and heaven first bestows its precious dew. Suddenly, a single drop of true mercury descends, piercing the heart with a chill like ice. It gathers in the *Palace of Intercourse*, coalescing into a luminous sphere, radiant and unceasingly bright. The sound is like a thousand drums pounding, ten thousand thunderclaps roaring. At this moment, the qi and blood of one’s entire body transform—do not be alarmed. One must bite down like iron, steel the heart, and remain unmoved. In perfect stillness, amidst the void, one may witness the union of dragon and tiger, the harmony of heaven and earth, the convergence of sun and moon, or the arrival of immortals and buddhas to celebrate the elixir’s completion. At this stage, all manner of suffering and joy manifest—do not acknowledge them, lest external demons disrupt the cultivation. Whether real or illusory, regard them as unseen, unheard. Remain steadfast, guarding the true nature’s yang radiance. Yin demons will naturally disperse, and lead and mercury will harmonize.

Three days later, the great medicine is born. These three days are the most arduous to endure. The entire world becomes a demonic realm: spirits wail and ghosts howl from all sides, murderous energy and war smoke fill the eight directions, plunging heaven and earth into darkness. This is the great opening of the passes. Of ten practitioners, nine are terrified to death. Remember, these are the machinations of the *Three Corpses* and yin spirits—do not heed them. Without fear or vexation, one proves oneself a vessel of the Dao.

Though the mercury has transformed into spirit, it remains yin spirit. Yin spirit is most cunning, capable of myriad transformations, conjuring all manner of visions to sabotage cultivation. Even with unyielding resolve, it will not submit willingly. As the ancients said: only with the six supernatural powers can one escape birth and death—otherwise, do not dream of attaining the Dao. This is the *Golden Liquid Returned Elixir*.

After two and a half days of blending, qi flows freely, every aperture shines, and spirit and qi reach their utmost fullness. Suddenly, with vibrant liveliness, the *inverse pearl of the sun* emerges, sheds its husk, and enters the mouth. A hundred thousand dragon deities are struck with awe. This is the *Seven-Return Nine-Cycle Golden Liquid Great Elixir* entering the mouth. Only then does one realize: *my fate is mine to command, not heaven’s.*

The immortal scriptures say: *"Only after this great death does one truly live."*

It further states: *"A single battle secures great peace"*—this is precisely such a station. The medicine of true death enters the mouth, and in an instant, the fire of the celestial circuit ignites. The skeletal frame dissolves into a mass of fleshly mud, while the yang spirit departs the body, unbound and unimpeded. With single-minded devotion, one upholds emptiness and nurtures the void—nurturing the spirit with the void, transforming the spirit into the void, the void into the spirit, in endless permutations. This is called: *"The perfected one, weary of dwelling in the dusty world, roams freely in the cavern-heavens, where three thousand jade maidens attend."* Day and night, one drinks immortal wine, wears immortal flowers, the four great elements harmonized, the entire body from head to toe utterly translucent.

Heaven and earth unite in harmony, sun and moon merge their light, wind and clouds converge, the tortoise and serpent intertwine. The ten heavens obey command, the myriad spirits receive their orders. Purple radiance billows, auspicious qi descends like frost. This is the *Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons*.

In this state of guarding the center and embracing the One, refining for a hundred days—these hundred days are the ten months of gestational nurturance. The first three months of this hundred-day period: the Mysterious Pass opens of itself. This Mysterious Pass is the true fire of the Great Yang, burning open the Mysterious Pass at the crown. The infant’s form appears, golden light enveloping the body, revealing heaven and earth, sun and moon, tortoise and serpent, dragon and tiger—all formed from the residual qi of copper, lead, and mercury, coalescing into guardian deities. At this station, one first obtains the *outer mercury of Qian*. Further, one can transmute *Qian’s mercury* into purple-red gold, becoming a treasure for abiding in the world. Refining it for another six months, the body becomes silver paste, the blood transforms into white nectar, the entire being exudes a fragrance that assails others, and the breath from the mouth forms clouds. This is the maturation of the elixir. A lump of *dry mercury*, when ingested by a person, confers immortality. It can even revive the dead.

When refined to the tenth month of the gestational cycle, the yang spirit sheds its husk, and one body can transform into a thousand myriad bodies. Nurtured to the twelfth month, one seizes the full tally of heaven and earth, able to manifest eighty-four thousand yang spirits, each spiritually awakened and sagely, their concealment and manifestation unfathomable, their transformations infinite. They tread the sun and moon without casting shadows, pass through metal and stone unimpeded, are untouched by water or fire, unharmed by blades or weapons, and even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom their mysteries. *Indra* cannot control their life or death—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established. The entire body’s qi mechanism is nothing but great medicine: a chicken that feeds on it becomes a phoenix, a dog that consumes it becomes a dragon, and any mortal who ingests it attains longevity. This principle is so profound even ghosts and spirits struggle to comprehend it.

The immortals say: *"When the inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir manifests."* To speak of inner cultivation is to encompass the outer. Why labor further with furnace and flame? For when one accumulates essence and amasses qi, nurturing it until qi is full and spirit complete, golden light appears, shining day and night without cease—then the inner elixir is complete, and the elixir beyond the body also takes form. This is the inevitable principle of inner truth resonating outwardly.

Awaiting silent audience with the Emperor on High, one is conferred celestial rank. The myriad spirits pay homage, able to split heaven and mend earth, pluck stars and replace the moon, command thunder and redirect the Dipper, summon wind and call forth rain. With every thought and movement, the gods of heaven and earth obey without fail. Such fortune and virtue surpass three generations of emperors; such wisdom outstrips seven lifetimes of top scholars.

Yet the foolish among mortals, shallow in spirit and meager in karmic affinity, cling to whatever they first encounter as their master, believing they have received the true transmission. In truth, they have strayed into side doors without realizing it, lost on divergent paths without awakening, instead growing arrogant and self-satisfied, their false pride rendering them unapproachable. At the mere sight of their demeanor and countenance, others are repelled from a thousand miles away. Even the wise and worthy turn away in dismay—how much more so the immortals and sages?

I exhort the seeker: before encountering a true teacher, one should cultivate humility and modesty, accumulate merit and virtue, refrain from all evil, and practice every good. Naturally, one will meet a perfected being, a luminous and worthy person. With earnest devotion and sincere entreaty, they will surely reveal the true workings within and without the body, the three great celestial mechanisms. Soon, one may ride alongside immortals and buddhas as an equal.

**Manifestations of the Dao-Body’s Verification**

In stillness, one suddenly detects rare fragrances filling the room, the tongue welling with sweet springs, the heart’s fire descending, warm water ascending. In the dead of night, one sees a needle through walls, perceives the heavens above and the underworld below. Crimson clouds spiral above the crown, lightning flashes in the eyes. Or, when a single qi surges into the heart, the ears hear fierce winds howling, rain pouring in ceaseless cycles. The azure sky and bright moon, snow blanketing the clear sky, the dragon and tiger’s meeting, the sun and moon merging their light.

Gazing inward at the viscera, they are as clear as if illuminated by a candle. The entire body, from top to bottom, resembles a crystal pagoda. Golden light envelops the body, cold springs trickle, warm qi lingers—none of this is illusion, but the tangible results of true practice, each to be recognized. When descending and swallowed into the elixir chamber, it must not be spat out or lost, for this is the root of the golden elixir.

Or, when the true qi of the kidneys surges forth, ascending to the *Mud Pill Palace* and descending to the *Bubbling Spring*, the ears hear the din of a thousand thousand war drums, ten thousand ten thousand thunderclaps. Fierce winds scour the earth, lightning splits the sky, the fire of the celestial circuit blazes, red-hot from top to bottom, penetrating sinews and bones. The four limbs and eight vessels flow freely in every part.

Or, one may fall into a stupor for three to five days, and in a dazed state, suddenly hear the speech of heaven, feeling the heart’s flower bloom wide open. The geography of mountains and rivers becomes as clear as one’s palm. Past and future, above and below—every matter under heaven and earth is known without exception.

At times, a radiant light may manifest, bursting forth from the *Cinnabar Chamber*, and suddenly the true nature leaps beyond the body, finding the four great elements foul and impure—this is the sign of the yang spirit departing its husk. One must swiftly draw it back, practicing the former method for three years, and naturally one will gain the power to transform into a thousand myriad forms.

Thereafter, one may go a hundred days without eating yet feel no hunger, or consume a hundred meals in a day yet feel no satiation. During the ten-month period of *warm nurturing* and the *Golden Liquid Returning Elixir*, one feels something at the *Weilü* surging straight upward through the *Jiaji* double passes. Each movement is audible, ascending in reverse to the *Mud Pill Palace*. It is as if something brushes against the brain, then descends from the upper palate into the mouth in bead-like drops, resembling sparrow’s eggs, with a taste like yang butter—fragrant, sweet, and richly smooth. One swallows it slowly, guiding it back to the *Cinnabar Field*. For nine consecutive days, this swallowing and absorption continues without cease.

From this point onward, the five viscera become clear and empty. With eyes closed, one gazes inward to see the organs and bowels as if illuminated by a candle. Gradually, golden light in myriad strands shines brilliantly, radiating beyond the body. The elixir’s radiance resembles a wheel of fire and rosy clouds, swirling and coiling above and below, enveloping the meditation seat. Gradually, it draws the yang spirit into *Great Samadhi*, becoming the true verification of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood—this is no mere metaphor, but the real vision.

The immortal master personally witnessed these wonders yet dared not speak of them to others, for they are not matters the common person can see or hear. Those with immortal affinity and Daoist bones who encounter this text should treasure and keep it secret.

**The Secret Passes and Caverns**

Behind the human body lie three passes: *Weilü*, *Jiaji*, and *Yuzhen*. *Weilü* is located at the end of *Jiaji*, its pass connecting to the aperture of the inner kidneys. The ascending path is a channel of marrow, called the *Hidden Stream* or the *Yellow River*—the route by which yang qi rises. It ascends directly to the seventh vertebra, where it meets the inner warmth, known as the *Jiaji Pass*. Further upward to the back of the brain lies the *Yuzhen Pass*. These are the three passes behind the body.

In front of the human body lie three fields: *Mud Pill*, *Earth Cauldron*, and *Flowery Pond*. The *Mud Pill* is the upper *Cinnabar Field*, a space one inch and two fen in circumference, a hollow cavity serving as the abode of spirit. This aperture lies between the brows; one inch inward is the *Hall of Brightness*, another inch inward is the *Cavern Chamber*, and yet another inch inward is the *Mud Pill Palace*—the upper *Cinnabar Field*.

Below the space between the brows, toward the mouth, are two apertures—the upper palate within the mouth, called the *Golden Bridge of the Nose* or the *Upper Magpie Bridge*. Beneath the tongue lie two more apertures, connecting downward to the windpipe and throat. The hard bone beneath the chin is the throat, the passage for the entry and exit of internal and external qi. The soft bone beneath the chin is the pharynx, the pathway for food and drink to reach the intestines and stomach. The windpipe has twelve segments, called the *Layered Tower*, descending directly to connect with the lung aperture and reach the heart.

Beneath the heart lies an aperture called the *Vermilion Palace*, the place where dragon and tiger meet. Three inches and six fen below is the *Earth Cauldron Yellow Court Palace*, the middle *Cinnabar Field*. To its left is the *Hall of Brightness*, to its right the *Cavern Chamber*—also a hollow space one inch and two fen in circumference, the abode of qi and the cauldron for refining the elixir. Externally, it aligns with the navel gate, approximately three inches and six fen away. Thus it is said: *Thirty-six above in heaven, thirty-six below on earth—from heaven to earth, eighty-four thousand miles. From heart to kidneys, one inch and four fen. Three inches and six fen from the heavenly heart, three inches and six fen from the earthly kidneys. The middle Cinnabar Field is one inch and two fen, totaling eight inches and four fen—matching the complete number of heaven and earth. The human body is a heaven and earth unto itself.*

Within the navel gate is the *Gate of Life*, containing seven apertures that connect to the external kidneys. The external kidneys are the pathways for the movement of essence and qi. Behind the navel and before the kidneys lies a cavity called the *Crescent Moon Furnace* or *Sea of Qi*. One inch and two fen below is the *Flowery Pond*, the lower *Cinnabar Field* where essence is stored and the medicine is gathered. To its left is the *Hall of Brightness*, to its right the *Cavern Chamber*—also a hollow space one inch and two fen in circumference. This place has two apertures: one upward, connecting to the inner kidneys, and one downward, connecting to *Weilü*. The space between is called the *Mysterious Pass*—the place where something arises from nothing. When refining essence to the point of fullness and qi sufficiency, the true qi of the One naturally emerges, and the *Mysterious Pass* opens of itself.

It is also said: Within the human body, there are three apertures for refining the golden elixir, which one must not fail to know. The upper aperture is the *Li Palace* of the heart, yang without and yin within, housing the original spirit—this is the nature, mercury, dragon, and *Heavenly Mountain*. The lower aperture is the *Kan Palace* of the kidneys, yin without and yang within, housing the original qi—this is the life, lead, tiger, and *Qi Cavern*. It is also the *Life Palace*, *Kun Furnace*, *Gate of Life*, and *Secret Door*—all referring to this one place. If one can rely on true intention and the original spirit to congeal below in the *Life Palace*, one will naturally transcend life and death.

Between these two apertures lies another for nurturing the embryo—a hollow and empty cavern, the void within the human body. It is located at the center of the body, between the heart and navel, at the *Yellow Court*—the middle *Cinnabar Field*. These are the key passes and caverns of the human body.

**A Hundred Days of Foundation-Building**
The initial stage of refining essence into qi is called "Small Achievement in Foundation-Building." The work of foundation-building lies in regulating the medicine and replenishing essence, refining essence into qi. Returning the heart to emptiness is precisely the method of gathering spirit, consolidating essence, and nurturing qi. When the essence and qi within the body are full and the marrow is strong, one may then enter the chamber to practice and seek the Way of Return.

Nurturing qi and consolidating essence, ceasing thoughts to attain reverence, observing the mind and preserving sincerity—from dawn to dusk, one washes the heart clean, retreats into concealment, blends the returning wind, and inwardly observes with heart and eyes. Establishing stillness to its utmost, one ensures not a single thread of burden remains in the square inch of the heart. Nurturing within the state of neither existence nor non-existence, externally unattached, internally free from thought, empty and vast, void yet numinous—the heart must not be allowed to wander with conditions.

As the ancients met their masters and received oral instructions, they were taught only to concentrate spirit into the qi cavern, which is precisely this. The qi cavern is the Gate of Life (*Mingmen*), located below the seventh vertebra of the spine, behind the navel and before the kidneys, seven-tenths forward and three-tenths back, between the two kidneys. The left pertains to water, the right to fire. Within it hangs an empty cavern, connected above to the *Mud Pill* and below to the *Bubbling Spring*, the ancestral source of the primordial Dao, the root of daily-generated qi, and the land where lead is produced. All the myriad transformations of the Dao and the unfathomable wonders of its mechanisms emerge from here. Thus it is said: "This cavern is no ordinary cavern; it is formed by the union of Heaven and Earth. Named the Cavern of Spirit and Qi, within it lies the essence of Kan and Li."

Daoists call it the *qi cavern*; physicians call it the *Gate of Life*. When the Gate of Life flourishes, the twelve meridians all flourish. When the Gate of Life declines, the twelve meridians all decline. If the Gate of Life generates, one lives; if it ceases, one dies.

*Note: This was personally verified in cultivation by the Perfected One Yin Xi.*

To enter the chamber and practice the Way of Return, one must sit upright in a quiet room, turn the gaze inward, and concentrate spirit into the region of the Gate of Life. Knowing without clinging, first preserving then relinquishing, empty the heart and concentrate spirit, neither attaching to form nor falling into emptiness. Void yet numinous, nurture with quiescent illumination, using three incense sticks as a measure. When the breath feels harmonious and the emptiness unimpeded, this is the true work of preserving spirit and attaining transformation. Practicing for no more than forty-nine days, water and fire will merge, and true yang will be born. Concentrating illumination for three months, one may gradually approach the inner refinement, gradually stabilizing to congeal the elixir. Concentrating illumination for a hundred days, one can penetrate the passes and traverse the caverns.

When spirit is stabilized below the navel, it is called "concentrating spirit." When qi hibernates below the navel, it is called "embryonic breathing." When heart and breath are both concealed below the navel, guarding their natural clarity, this is called "do not forget." Following their natural clarity is called "do not assist." Ultimately, take emptiness as the dwelling of the heart, and obscurity as the homeland of resting spirit. Repeatedly clarifying, repeatedly sinking, gradually heart and breath will depend on each other, spirit and qi will merge, and unconsciously, yang will arise, leaving one as if intoxicated.

*Note: This was personally verified in cultivation by the Perfected One Guarding Yang.*

**Abstaining from Meat, Pungent, and Spicy Foods**
When beginning quiet practice, first abstain from meat, pungent, and spicy foods. Meat is heavy and turbid in flavor; consuming it will coarsen the postnatal qi, making it difficult to subdue. Pungent and spicy foods are light and floating in nature; consuming them will scatter the primordial qi, preventing its gathering. One must understand that the principle lies in prohibiting meat, pungent, and spicy foods, strictly adhering to a plain vegetarian diet to eliminate original flavors. Do not eat to excess, for excess harms the spirit. Do not starve, for starvation harms the qi. Diet must be balanced and moderate—eat when hungry, stop when full. This is the Dao of eating, which later generations of truth-seekers must not overlook.

*Note: This was personally verified in cultivation by Master Shangyang.*

**Oral Instructions on Gathering the Heart and Refining the Self**
In beginning the practice of the truth, refining the heart is paramount. When thoughts arise, firmly maintain correct awareness to sweep away stray thoughts and return to singular focus. Establish stillness to its utmost, return to emptiness and enter samādhi, sweeping away the three minds and extinguishing the four appearances. Only when the heart-ground is still and the nature-heaven is cool may one concentrate spirit and enter samādhi, silently guarding the mechanism of opening and closing, the count of exiting and entering. With two exhalations, the mechanism opens; with one inhalation, the mechanism closes. Spirit resides in the qi cavern, visualizing the breath rising through the Governing Vessel like the red sun ascending to the crown of Qian. Like the vast moon, it descends through the Conception Vessel into the Kun furnace.

Count one to ten, then ten to a hundred, extending to thousands and tens of thousands without error. Gather the heart in the counting, ensuring thoughts do not scatter, intent does not stray, and heart and breath move in mutual dependence—this is tethering the heart-monkey firmly and hitching the intent-horse high. The ancients said: *"True intent comes and goes without interruption; to know yet not cling is the skill."* To fixate on intent is to err at every turn; to lapse into non-action is to fall into emptiness. From having a heart, transform into having no heart, rendering the heart’s substance hollow and vast, empty yet numinous—thus free from arising and ceasing.

To dispel delusive thoughts, first maintain correct awareness. With awareness, thoughts naturally vanish; when the absence of thoughts becomes deeply ingrained, dreams cease. Without dreams, the heart dies and spirit lives—this is the great matter at hand. For if the heart is not refined, the spirit will not settle, and the radiance of inherent nature will surely waver. If intent is not refined, emotions will not perish, and the root of life will not be secure. One must extinguish the fire in the heart and dissolve boundless desires. Guard the one true within at all times, empty the myriad conditions in every place, so that the nature-heaven becomes cool and clear, untroubled by joy or delight—this is the work of refining the self. Thus it is said: *"Before refining the returned elixir, first refine the self; only when the self is fully refined may the elixir be returned."*

Gather what is scattered, then release it. With long and steadfast practice, how could it not be preserved?

---

*This is the embodied realization of the Ancestral Master of True Yang, revealing the celestial mechanism of turning the light inward and returning illumination.*

The Way of inner refinement is most simple and most easy—it is merely to subdue the heart’s fire and guide it into the cinnabar field. The cinnabar field is the Water Palace of Kan; the heart is the Fire Palace of Li. When fire enters water, water and fire merge, and true yang is born. The ancients called this "heart and kidney," not Kan and Li.

The Perfected One of True Yang said: *"Subduing the heart’s fire is like moving the southern star into the northern star’s position."* Stone Apricot Grove said: *"With spirit returning to qi, the inner elixir naturally forms."* Liu Haichan said: *"I awakened to the principle of long life: the great yang submits to the great yin."* Xu Jingyang said: *"Let me reveal my family’s tradition: the great yang moves into the bright moon."* Ancestral Master Wang Chongyang said: *"At the beginning of laying the foundation, first sink the spirit of the upper aperture into the qi cavern of the lower aperture. Heart and breath depend on each other, so that true intent remains ever aware. With each exhalation and inhalation, they circulate within the furnace of creation. Over time, as this becomes deeply ingrained, fire naturally arises below the navel, the tiger is born within water, and without seeking the center, one naturally returns to it."*

At first, guard the single aperture below the navel. Turning the light inward and returning illumination reveals only a sphere of darkness, like the moon’s yin essence—a realm of pure yin. When the fire of Li shines upon it, and the wind of the Dipper blows, darkness naturally gives birth to light, fire arises within water, and a warm qi swirls around the qi cavern—this is the initial stirring of true yang, being born from non-being.

It is also said: *"Beneath pure yin, one must use wind and fire to forge and temper, only then can yang qi arise."* All this elucidates the nurturing of a single point of emptiness and the primordial spirit, concealing it within the qi cavern—this is called "sending it back to the earthen cauldron" and "sealing it firmly." The primordial spirit’s numinous radiance of inherent nature rests within, like a turtle in hiding, like a snake in hibernation. Neither forgetting nor aiding, as if present yet as if absent, over time breath and breath intermingle, spirit and qi embrace, and the mysterious pass naturally opens—thus the true seed is born.

*This is the embodied realization of Bai Yuchan.*

**The Wondrous Application of Civil and Martial Wind and Fire**

At the outset of practice, whenever after midnight at the hour of *zi*, when stillness is profound and natural awakening occurs, at the moment when the first yang revives and the outer kidneys stir, when primordial essence exudes and the external medicine arises—this is the time to engage in the work of regulating the medicine, moving the mysterious mechanism of wind blowing and fire refining.

Wind is the qi of exhalation and inhalation. Fire is the numinous spirit.

The civil aspect is the wind and fire of non-action. The martial aspect is the wind and fire of action. The civil wind and civil fire of non-action are employed at the two ends before and after regulating the external medicine. The martial wind and martial fire of action are employed precisely when the primordial essence is at its peak during the regulation of the external medicine. When the true qi stirs, it most readily flows downward and outward in sequence—one must use true intention and the gaze of the eyes, concentrating them into the Qi Cavity of the Life Palace to govern and restrain it. As the true qi descends, it transforms into primordial essence. Without the breath of exhalation and inhalation, using wind to assist fire and fire to refine metal, the primordial essence cannot revert to primordial qi and return to its original abode in the Kun furnace.

When employing the breath of exhalation and inhalation within the Cinnabar Field, one must rouse the spirit, fix the gaze, focus the mind unwaveringly, and empty all distractions. By stirring the Xun wind and fanning the furnace flame, each breath returns to its root—only then does it accord with the divine skill of swift and intense refinement. Yet the intention within the furnace must not cling to the breath; it should focus solely on the primordial qi, merely borrowing the mechanism of breath as the means for gathering and refining.

*This is the embodied realization of Ancestor Qiu.*

**Spirit Hibernating in the Sea of Qi**
When practicing the work of settling the spirit in the lower field, gently guide the empty and formless primordial spirit into the place of the True Person’s breath, hibernating it within the Kun furnace. Stand in utmost stillness, sinking deeper and deeper, quieting further and further, neither existing nor not existing—first present, then absent—until body and mind sink into the realm of nothingness. At this moment, a single point of true intention, the numinous light of inherent nature, lies concealed in the abyss beneath the nine springs, hidden and unmoving, transformed into nothingness. Like a tortoise in hiding or a snake in hibernation, spirit and qi embrace, forever anchoring the lower field—this is called "the arrival of one’s earth," entering the state of profound obscurity. The postnatal breath ceases, the prenatal qi connects, the mysterious pass opens, and the true seed is born.

*This is the embodied realization of Ancestor Lü.*

**Impartiality in Movement and Stillness**
In the practice of purity and non-action, if movement and stillness are improperly balanced, there arises the danger of yin and yang becoming excessive. When movement reaches its extreme, stillness is required—without stillness, yang becomes excessive and harms the spirit. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is required—without movement, yin becomes excessive and harms the qi. The key lies in the union of the two earths, Wu and Ji, forming the "jade tablet," with movement and stillness circulating without bias—only then is it attained.

The ancients said: Some possess sufficient nature cultivation but lack in life cultivation. Though they may nurture the Cinnabar Field until it shines like the bright moon, they cannot refine it to the point where the turtle contracts and does not rise. Others possess sufficient life cultivation but lack in nature cultivation. Though they may refine it to the turtle’s contraction and non-rising, they cannot nurture the Cinnabar Field until it gleams like the radiant moon. Only through dual cultivation without bias, with nature and life in balance, when the time arrives, will there be no danger of yin or yang becoming excessive. Naturally, the horse’s yin conceals its form, the elixir’s light shines, and the Cinnabar Field becomes like the moon’s bright imprint.

*This is the embodied realization of Zhao Penglai.*

**The Wondrous Application of Martial Fire**
During the refinement of martial fire, stir the Xun wind and fan the furnace flame. With the heart’s power roused and the gaze fixed, focus the mind unwaveringly, emptying all thoughts. Concentrate within the Qi Cavity of the Cinnabar Field, where flames surge and radiance blazes like a smelting furnace—drawing the bellows, igniting the charcoal, and kindling the flame as the means for gathering and refining. Draw back the externally arising wisdom-life metal essence to its original position, continuing until the mechanism reverses and the qi turns, the external kidneys fully retracting. Then refine again, transforming all primordial essence into primordial qi, until a scene of sky-clearing and air-brightening appears—this is the moment to cease the martial fire.

*This is the embodied realization of Ancestor Hao, the True Person of Great Antiquity.*

**The Wondrous Application of Civil Fire**
After using martial fire to refine the external medicine and the primordial qi returns to its original abode, cease the wind and fire of action. Then employ the non-action spirit-fire for constant gentle nurturing, with true intention lightly governing, as if present yet as if absent, without interruption. Settle the spirit within the Qi Cavity, knowing yet not clinging, allowing the natural breath to flow continuously, ever-present and unceasing. First present, then absent, one enters the state of primordial chaos and profound obscurity. The breath of exhalation and inhalation is postnatal, yet it arouses the mechanism of prenatal qi. The spirit does not leave the Qi Cavity, naturally circulating endlessly. Whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, it remains within the square inch—civil fire’s gentle nurturing is ever-present, while martial fire’s refinement adapts to change.

It is also said: Martial fire refines, civil fire bathes—both the transformation of essence into qi are governed by the two fires of civil and martial.

*This is the embodied realization of Chan Master Huayang.*

**The Heavenly Mechanism of Seeding, Gathering, Refining, and Nurturing the External Medicine**
The initial regulation of medicine to replenish essence is called "restraining the Yang Pass." There is a four-character oral formula: seeding, gathering, refining, nurturing.

Seeding means concentrating the spirit into the Qi Cavity, turning the heart’s power and gaze inward to illuminate and gather in the lower field. Quiet it further and further, sink it deeper and deeper, until it reaches the realm of nothingness, entering the field of utter stillness and extinction, merging into primordial chaos—forgetting the person and the self. This is called "emptiness at its extreme, stillness at its utmost." Wait until the foundation of chaos opens, the primordial qi stirs, transforming into primordial essence, surging through the Yang Pass, swelling unbearably, arousing desire and indulgence. Here, one must firmly uphold right awareness and swiftly apply the methods of gathering and refining. Any delay risks the external medicine escaping, essence failing, qi depleting, and the stillness practice becoming difficult—how tragic that would be.

It is also said: Those who cultivate the true Dao must first empty the heart and fill the belly—only then can they dispel illness, prolong life, abide in the world, and how could immortality not be attained?

**Oral Instructions on Gathering the Medicine**

What is meant by "gathering"?

The Ancestral Master replied: Wait until the foundation of chaos opens and the first Yang returns. When the external kidneys stir and the living Zi hour arrives, immediately turn the light inward and reflect, settling the spirit within the qi cavity. With each inhalation and exhalation, the Xun wind reverses to fan the Li fire of the life palace, igniting the furnace flame. Yet the mind must not cling to breath—focus solely on the primordial qi.

The oral instruction states: To know the breath at the time of gathering, inhalation requires intent, while exhalation is effortless. With mental force, raise the gaze to fix it unwaveringly, free from all attachments, empty of all conditions. Here, inhalation is employed, not exhalation—exhalation merely follows. Whether ten breaths or several dozen, continue until the external kidneys fully retract. When the Yang organ shows no movement, this is called "gathering the medicine and returning it to the furnace," the primordial essence restored to its original position.

It is also said: When the time arrives, the spirit knows. Begin gathering at the first sign, and it is easily subdued. If sleep is deep and awareness delayed, the Yang will be vigorous and the nature fierce. Do not forcefully gather or prolong the struggle, lest the qi be harmed. Simply concentrate the spirit to illuminate the Yin meridian, relax body and mind, forget form and self, allowing each breath to return to its root. Let it naturally fan and sigh. When the peak begins to wane and the impulse to retreat has not yet faded, in no more than three to five breaths, draw the primordial qi back completely. The medicine returns to the furnace, and one must cease the martial fire of gathering, shifting to a half-literary, half-martial fire for the refining method.

**Annotation:** This is the experiential realization of Ma Danyang.

**Oral Instructions on Refining the Medicine**

What is meant by "refining"?

The answer: Once the medicine returns to the furnace, swiftly apply the refining method. The true oral instruction for refining employs both inhalation and exhalation. The spirit abides in the qi cavity, halting the natural breath to smelt and refine. Ascension requires intent; descent requires awareness. Inhalation is for gathering; exhalation is for smelting. The key is to proceed with ease and smoothness, avoiding forcefulness or abruptness. Thirty-six breaths serve as the measure, or seventy-two breaths may also suffice. Fan the qi mechanism of the cinnabar field until it naturally fans and sighs. From intent to non-intent, from the deliberate breath to the effortless sigh, the primordial essence is entirely transformed into primordial qi, returning to lodge in the life palace—this is called "refining."

After refining, the literary fire must be maintained for a hundred or more breaths before one may rest and lie down, returning to primordial chaos. If the practice ceases too soon and the true essence is not fully transformed into qi, there remains the risk of loss.

**Oral Instructions on the Literary Fire for Nurturing**

What is meant by "nurturing"?

The answer: Cease the deliberate breath and employ the natural sigh to warm and nurture. Initially, there is awareness and illumination, yet it remains effortless. Empty the heart and settle the spirit within the qi cavity, guarding it at all times with true intent. Gently sigh and breathe, like embers in a furnace—continuous and unbroken, ever-present. Heart and breath depend on each other; spirit and qi merge. Without clinging, one knows how to guard; without effort, the sigh arises naturally. Spirit and qi both return to stillness and tranquility, unknowingly entering the profound obscurity of primordial chaos—this is called "nurturing," also known as "bathing," the literary fire.

Practicing diligently each night and illuminating silently each day, the young may succeed in little over a month, those in middle age in a hundred days, and the elderly within a year. Naturally and unknowingly, from non-being arises being, and the celestial mechanism stirs. Suddenly, the breath reverses into the sea of qi, the mysterious pass opens, and the true seed emerges. Proceeding with the fire talisman of the celestial circuit, the great medicine is refined, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood.

**Annotation:** This is the experiential realization of Ancestral Master Wang Yuyang.

**Oral Instructions on Applying Fire to the Pure and Impure**

Zhang Guolao said: In this section, for those whose qi arises from clarity and emptiness, employ the method of *absorbing, licking, contracting, and sealing*. After gathering the medicine and returning it to the furnace, proceed with the fire talisman of the celestial circuit to purify the path. For those whose qi arises in dream-sleep, the qi is clear but the spirit is dull—use a half-literary, half-martial fire to gather it. For those whose qi arises amid lustful desire, the spirit and qi are dull and impure, entirely postnatal—employ only the martial fire for refining. Such is the subtle application of the pure and impure.

In summary, raise the mental force and gaze fully, using true intent to sigh as the martial fire, and awareness without thought as the literary fire. Otherwise, the Yin essence will not be refined and transformed, inevitably causing internal disturbances, human illnesses, and hindering stillness practice.

**Annotation:** This is the experiential realization of Zhang Guolao.

**Oral Instructions on Refining Yin Essence to Distinguish the Prenatal and Postnatal**

At the Zi hour of prenatal primordial essence, the body has already turned toward darkness and rest, still and effortless. Arising from the profound obscurity of emptiness, beyond heaven and earth, persons and things—vast and empty, yet numinous and responsive—it stirs the Yang pass. This is the primordial ancestral qi, purely the essence of the prenatal, without dregs, the true medicine. Immediately gather and return it to the furnace, proceed with the fire talisman of the celestial circuit to smelt and refine, coalescing the golden elixir. Only then can one transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.

At the Zi hour of postnatal sexual essence, the heart remains entangled with the roots of sensation, arising from the confusion of dreams and illusions, with heaven and earth, persons and things. Stirring the external kidneys, it is the Yin essence transformed by the union of essence and desire, unfit for medicine.

One must employ the wind and fire to gather and return, fiercely refining with urgent smelting, mobilizing the martial fire’s divine efficacy to fan the furnace flames, ensuring it transforms into qi to avoid harm. The method of refining involves using the ordinary fire of breath to arouse the true fire of the Life Palace, then governing it with the spiritual fire of inherent nature, so that the three fires blaze with radiance, igniting flames within the furnace. Within the Elixir Field, with each inhalation and exhalation, the breath circulates and returns to the Qian crucible; the spirit abides in the qi cavity, the gaze fixed unwaveringly—how could the Yin essence, stubborn as metal, fail to dissolve? This is the true celestial mechanism of harmonizing and refining the medicine, the authentic oral instruction for refining essence into qi.

*This is the realized insight of Master Wuming.*

**The Wondrous Application of Civil and Martial Gathering and Refining**
Civil fire nurtures gently, continuous and unbroken, without beginning or end. Martial fire forges and tempers with timely defense and attack, possessing clear starts and stops. As for the Xun wind, it awaits the moment of Yang’s return, where civil and martial arts intermingle in wondrous application. Gathering employs inhalation rather than exhalation, while refining utilizes both. However, when departing from fire for gentle nurturing, one must avoid excess, the subtlety lying in a state between presence and absence, ensuring the bellows neither overworks nor falters. Beware of brute force and haste; all must flow with ease and grace. Constantly sense the qi, breath by breath reaching the Life Stem, to ensure safety.

*This is the realized insight of Master Ningxuan.*

**Oral Instructions for Civil Fire Bathing**
The tranquil practice of the Great Elixir of the Primordial Heaven requires the proper sequence of fire phases and the wondrous application of civil and martial fires, which must be transmitted orally by a true teacher to be employed without doubt. When primordial Yang has yet to arise, abide in spirit and exhale with breath, maintaining unbroken continuity, each breath returning to the root—this is the work of civil fire bathing. It is called the furnace’s fire seed, or the returning wind’s fusion. When Yang arises, gather it externally with martial fire, then refine it internally with martial fire—this is called restraining the Yang Pass, harmonizing the external medicine. Once the medicine returns to the furnace and transforms into qi, spirit and breath remain mutually guarding and attentive. Concentrate the spirit and enter samadhi within the qi cavity, dissolving into extinction. Proceed until the utmost state of primordial chaos, where the mechanism of return naturally emerges. When the mechanism stirs, harmonize it, then re-enter chaos. With prolonged practice, whether day or night, once essence is full and qi abundant, the Mysterious Pass naturally opens, the true seed emerges—all must be nurtured with civil fire and refined with martial fire.

*This is the realized insight of Zhang Sanfeng.*

**The Perils of Martial Fire’s Lightness and Heaviness in Gathering Medicine**
When gathering medicine and returning it to the furnace, misjudging martial fire—whether too light or too heavy—inevitably leads to peril. If martial fire is too light, the breath floats and fails to return to the root, causing Yin essence to accumulate in the abdomen, stagnating and untransformed, ultimately risking loss. If martial fire is too heavy, the breath becomes coarse and unregulated, drawing external cold qi inward, stagnating in the abdomen, inevitably leading to abdominal pain and loose stools. Know that martial fire does not rely on deliberate effort at the mouth or nose, nor on violent breathing. Instead, gather the mind’s strength, fix the gaze, and concentrate a sphere of true intent, excluding all else. Focus the mind and visualize within the Elixir Field, as if in a smelting furnace, stirring the Xun wind—this is like pumping the bellows, fanning the furnace. Merely borrow the qi mechanism of the postnatal to guide each inhalation and exhalation, breath by breath returning to the root, stirring the qi mechanism of the prenatal. Let the two qi surge within the Elixir Field, swirling in the qi cavity, naturally harmonizing closure and opening. The bellows will then move of their own accord, as if flames surge from the furnace. In refining, always unite spirit with qi and qi with spirit. Within the Elixir Field, feel it smelted into golden liquid and silver waves, shimmering and rolling like the moon’s reflection—how could Yin essence remain?

*This is the realized insight of Master Guangcheng.*

**Martial Fire Forging**
Once the medicine returns to the furnace, continue forging with martial fire. The closure and opening of gathering medicine emphasize inhalation, using inhalation rather than exhalation—short exhalation, long inhalation. Inhalation is intentional, exhalation is effortless. Within ascent lies descent, within descent lies ascent. In refining medicine, closure and opening employ both inhalation and exhalation equally, with all movements deliberate. This is the ascent within descent, descent within ascent, the half-civil, half-martial refining of medicine. Know that martial fire refining lies entirely in the interplay of south and north, the mutual infusion of above and below, harmonizing the Four Symbols. Civil fire bathing ensures the cinnabar does not disperse. Central Palace nurturing gathers the Five Phases—this is the celestial mechanism of harmonizing external medicine, fully revealed.

*This is the realized insight of the Yellow Emperor.*

**Civil Fire’s Silent Illumination**
Civil fire nurturing is the natural act of breathing. Only by concentrating the spirit in the qi cavity, maintaining unbroken continuity, and abiding in this state at all times—whether moving, resting, sitting, or lying—does the breath naturally remain within the Elixir Field. This is called civil fire nurturing. The breath of this nurturing is the postnatal breath, stirring the qi mechanism of the prenatal. When the spirit does not depart from the qi cavity, the circulation is naturally endless. Each inhalation and exhalation forms two movements of closure and opening, the qi mechanism of the postnatal ordinary person. Closure and opening signify the interplay of spirit and qi.

*This is the realized insight of Han Xiangzi.*

**Dream-Wandering and Essence Leakage**
At times during deep sleep, the external yang fails to rise, and the intent wanders, leading to spontaneous leakage. Why does this occur? It arises when, during the refinement of essence, the wind and fire are insufficient, and the steaming and fumigation do not reach their mark. This indicates a lapse in the firing process—an interruption rather than unbroken continuity, lacking the work of seamless density. Or perhaps the spirit is dull and prone to slumber, knowing how to gather but not how to refine. The yang essence is not fully gathered, knowing refinement but not nurturance. When the yang essence is incompletely transmuted, it cannot fully return to qi, resulting in cold fire and chilled elixir. During dreams, yin demons often assail, causing leakage. Or if the gentle wind is excessive while the fire of Li is deficient, or if the intent lingers at the mouth and nose, drawing cold qi inward, it may lead to abdominal pain and loose stools—all due to imprecise firing.

During refinement, the spirit must abide within, the heart forgotten without, while true intent never strays from the qi cavity of the Elixir Field. Overtaxing the mind scatters the spirit, leaving it without a master; overtaxing the body dissipates qi and depletes essence. If the heart and strength are wearied, sleep and rest become restless, spirit and qi fail to unite, and true essence risks slipping away. When the heart’s fire flares upward, the kidney’s water must flow downward. First, one must lay down body and mind, take a great rest, and settle into stillness for a time. As the ancients said: *To still the heart, first calm the body.* Then, empty the heart and concentrate the spirit in the lower Elixir Field. Swiftly apply martial fire to refine for thirty-six breaths, then gather the spirit in the qi cavity, entering the boundless darkness of primordial chaos. Otherwise, true essence will inevitably leak outward and fail to stabilize.

It is also said: *Empty the heart so it does not move, to nurture the spirit. Conserve strength so it does not weary, to nurture qi.* When the spirit is nurtured, it congeals; when qi is nurtured, it gathers. With spirit and qi undispersed, how could the Great Elixir fail to form?

*This is the realized insight of Ju Huolong.*

**The Opening of the Mysterious Pass**
When the Mysterious Pass reveals itself and the true seed is about to emerge, one must know the moment. From non-being, being arises—the true seed is born precisely then. Yet one must not act too soon, hastily gathering it. Too early, and the medicine is tender, its qi faint and ineffective. Too late, and the medicine is overripe, its qi scattered and ungathered. Only when it is neither old nor tender is it the true time for gathering.

What is "old"? When the jade cavern’s dual breaths have passed, and the yang member’s arousal has waned. What is "tender"? When a sudden roar halts the breath, and respiration reverses back to the primordial sea.

It is also said: When refining the heart and cultivating the self, transmuting essence into qi, the true seed emerges—then turn the light inward, reflecting essence and qi upon the lower Elixir Field. Yet one must not cling to appearances, using reflection externally or internally. For if one clings to the internal, all falls into emptiness and loss. Only by knowing without fixation, the spirit concealed in the Great Void, can one silently align with the transforming mechanism. With no thought arising, all conditions empty, the solitary true nature stands serene and unmoving—this is called *gathering what has returned, laying down what was taken up.*

*This is the realized insight of Cui Xifan.*

---

**The Birth of the True Seed: Neither Old Nor Tender, the Heavenly Mechanism**
The prenatal true seed is originally formless. Through the intermingling of spirit and qi, their fusion becomes complete. Unawares, the Elixir Field suddenly grows warm and harmonious, the entire body suffused with bliss, an itch stirring in every pore, body and mind without mastery. The Elixir Field warms, the qi mechanism gradually stirs, the yang member rises vigorously, and a cool breath enters the crown. Within the qi cavity, a sudden roar severs the breath, cutting off respiration at the mouth and nose, reversing it back to the primordial sea. Only then does one feel a throbbing sound in the lower Elixir Field, a trembling that lingers before suddenly stilling. The breath seems to float upward—sometimes escaping through the nose, sometimes not, or reaching the throat before returning. Then, with another roar, the breath abruptly reverses into the qi cavity, neither exiting nor entering, the throbbing sound lingering, the trembling persisting. This may occur three, five, or six or seven times before ceasing.

The Elixir Field becomes an empty vastness, unbounded above or below, containing a single entity—this is the sprout of medicine. When the qi mechanism is at its most tender, one must not stir the thought of gathering; instead, return to emptiness and await it. The heart’s longing should be like the mutual attraction of magnets, spirit and qi like hibernating creatures merging. As if in the womb before birth, in a state of hazy indistinction, I do not willingly part from it, nor does it willingly leave me—intertwined, knotted into one. Unawares, one enters primordial chaos. The inner landscape seems to open and close, yet no actual opening or closing is seen; it seems to pour and leak, yet no true pouring or leaking occurs. Its wonder is beyond words or description.

At this moment, the four limbs and hundred bones cannot move. Only the ears may hear others’ speech. Companions guarding the Dao must watch over the one in samadhi with utmost care—disturbing one in this state is to wound life at the very moment of its renewal. After a time, an itch stirs in every pore, the limbs soft as cotton. In a state of hazy indistinction, the heart’s nature regains its clarity. Above, respiration resumes; below, the yang member revives. The qi of the Elixir Field moves downward and backward along the root of the kidney meridian. Between the pubic hair, an itch arises, a blissful sensation. This is what is meant by *qi full, the Ren and Du channels open naturally.* The jade bell tolls once, the jade cavern’s dual breaths resume, and the nose’s respiration returns. When the time is ripe and qi transforms, the medicine is born, and the spirit knows—this is the opening of the Mysterious Pass, the birth of the true seed.

Just at the moment of neither old nor tender—this is the body’s natural mechanism of transformation. When the qi flows in its ordinary course, it is precisely the time for its reversal; this opportunity must not be missed. Swiftly apply the four-character true oral formula of *licking, sucking, contracting, and sealing*, gathering the spirit into the qi cavity. Gather the medicine and return it to the furnace, sealing it tightly, then activate the mysterious workings of the Zhou Tian fire talisman and turn the great Dharma wheel’s wondrous function. Refine and temper it to congeal the great elixir of golden cinnabar. When the count of three hundred Zhou Tian cycles is complete, this becomes the foundation for transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood. This is the moment when essence is full and returns to the unbroken state of the Qian body.

It is also said: reverse the breath back to the primordial sea, hibernating for ninety breaths, or one or two hundred breaths, until the qi suddenly surges forth—this is the true firing process. When the practice reaches its subtlety, without the mysterious workings of the fire talisman and the oral formula for harmonizing the medicine, it cannot succeed at all.

**Production of the True Seed: Heavenly Mechanism of Stages**
When the Mysterious Pass opens, the scene of bliss may continue opening twenty or thirty times before ceasing, or even for ten or twenty days before stopping. The duration naturally varies. Human spirit and qi are active by day and still by night. When qi arrives, the spirit knows, and as the true qi circulates one Zhou Tian, it refines and grows ever more vigorous. The movement of qi becomes more frequent, advancing day and night without respite. In a single day, three to five Zhou Tian cycles may be completed, even up to ten or more. The practice then extends through day and night without pause. Gradually, one feels the essence entirely transformed into qi, and the impulses of movement lessen day by day. Between day and night, the cycles gradually reduce to three or five, and the qi’s movement dissipates as soon as it arises, unable to fill the jade stem. As soon as yang stirs, it wanes, and one must gather it as it dissipates, circulating it through the Zhou Tian. Under no circumstances should the spirit leave the lower Elixir Field, lest the spirit and qi leak away, and the Three Treasures separate, rendering them useless. Proceed with utmost care, and through diligent practice, the effects will swiftly manifest in the true experience of refining essence into qi.

Each opening of the Mysterious Pass and each circulation of the Zhou Tian fire talisman is called *the inversion of yin and yang*, comprising three hundred and sixty breaths. Over time, the *yin of the horse* conceals its form, the fire is sufficient, the medicine potent, the tortoise head retracts, and the count of Zhou Tian cycles is complete. When the yang light appears three times, one proceeds to the seven-day practice of gathering the great medicine.

**Heavenly Mechanism of Gathering the True Seed: Oral Formula**
The true seed, the small medicine, is returned to the furnace. Therein lies the wonder of *absorbing, licking, contracting, and sealing*.

*Absorbing* means drawing qi through the nose to connect with the primordial;
*Licking* means the tongue pressing the upper palate to welcome the sweet dew;
*Contracting* means tightly contracting the perineum and lifting it inward;
*Sealing* means closing the mouth, lowering the curtain, turning the light inward, and tightly sealing the six gates.

If the lower is not sealed, the fire does not gather, and the metal does not ascend. If the three passes above are not sealed, the spirit scatters outward, and the medicine does not congeal. Omit the *contracting* character, and perform the rest simultaneously. The *contracting* is applied when the qi mechanism is about to return; the spirit returns to the body, distractions are cast aside, and the qi naturally returns.

---

**Heavenly Mechanism of Sealing and Securing: Oral Formula**
Once the medicine has returned to the furnace, it must be sealed with true intention. The cessation of breath follows the subjugation of spirit and qi—this is the beginning of the Zi hour in the circulation of the Zhou Tian. Thus it is said: the Zi hour has the moment of bathing, which is this.

*Sealing* means closing the three passes of the ears, eyes, and mouth, embodying the meaning of *concentrating the spirit and gathering the qi* for nurturing. *Cessation of breath* does not mean holding the breath; rather, it means refraining from the methods of gathering medicine and stirring the breath. Instead, with each exhalation, the spirit and qi are both subdued into the qi cavity, lingering for the duration of one breath, swirling above the Elixir Field. When the breath arises, it is exhaled, and at the moment of transition to inhalation, the spirit seizes the qi. Ascending along the Du meridian, the true intention leads the primordial qi, reversing from the Kun abdomen up to the Qian tripod—this is the small Zhou Tian. Advancing the yang qi is the act of gathering, which is the first breath of the Zi hour in the Zhou Tian. This is applied during the six yang hours, and the Zhou Tian fire talisman begins its circulation from here. Exhalation serves as bathing, which is the gentle fire.

When the count of six yang hours is complete, at noon, the yin talisman retreats. However, the mechanism of the primordial qi in the head is led by true intention, descending from Kunlun with the inhalation along the Ren meridian down to the Kun furnace for refinement. This is applied during the six yin hours. The primordial qi of the Qian tripod, following the true intention, descends from the upper palate, down the *heavy tower*, into the qi cavity. Inhalation serves as bathing, which is the gentle fire.

**Heavenly Mechanism of Mao and You Bathing: Oral Formula**
Arrange the tripod and furnace to refine the mysterious root;
Advance and retreat must know the gates of Mao and You.
At dawn and dusk, within Yin, know the firing process;
Bathing divides the embryo at the gates of Mao and You.

*Bathing* is the proper work of elixir refinement. The *gates of Mao and You* are the positions for bathing—this is the *yellow court* at the *spine’s pivot*. Bathing is the most crucial and wondrous practice in becoming an immortal or a Buddha. Bathing is the work of returning to emptiness, entering the chamber, and resting the heart in non-action.

Within bathing, there is the principle of advance and retreat, yet one need not employ the work of ascent and descent. The *jade pivot* halts its wheel for a time. Before the golden elixir is congealed, without bathing, the pearl cannot coagulate and manifest its form. After the immortal embryo is formed, without bathing, one cannot exit the spirit and enter transformation. Bathing is the wondrous function that encompasses elixir refinement.

What is bathing? After advancing the yang fire and ascending, bathing occurs when the spirit resides at the spine’s pivot—this is the Mao hour. Silently count thirty-six breaths; this is the completion of the Mao hour.

Withdrawing the yin tally and descending, bathing occurs when the spirit resides at the Yellow Court—this is the You hour. Silently count twenty-four exhalations; this is the completion of the You hour.

Bathing is always marked by awareness without thought, stillness without motion, yet preceding all action. The ancients said: "This is the great rest, the meaning of gentle fire and nurturing." Though non-action, it is not dull torpor; though numbered, it is not forced.

When bathing is complete, the spirit and intent lead the primordial qi. Thus, when advancing the yang fire and withdrawing the yin tally, one must circulate the full count of the celestial cycle. Only with clarity at the source can the primordial qi be preserved without risk of leakage.

If, in advancing the fire and withdrawing the tally, bathing at Mao and You is neglected, even with the celestial cycle hazily completed, the golden elixir may still be lost. Cultivators must proceed with utmost care and caution to avoid peril.

Bathing is concealed in profound emptiness—this is the true scene of bathing’s emptiness. It is also said: In the celestial cycle’s fire tally of three hundred and sixty breaths, each breath contains bathing. When ascending afterward, exhalation is bathing. When descending beforehand, inhalation is bathing. These are the post-heaven breaths of ordinary beings, all governed by natural principle—why force it? The celestial mechanism of bathing is inexhaustibly profound.

---

**Yang Fire and Yin Tally Oral Secrets of the Celestial Mechanism**
Once the medicine is sealed and secured, swiftly circulate the celestial cycle. At the Zi hour, advance the yang fire and ascend, stopping at the Si hour. At the Wu hour, withdraw the yin tally and descend, stopping at the Hai hour.

During the advance of the yang fire, there is bathing at the Mao hour. During the withdrawal of the yin tally, there is bathing at the You hour.

What is this wondrous function? From Zi to Si, the spirit resides in the lower field, exhaling gently and inhaling forcefully. From Wu to Hai, the spirit resides in the upper field, exhaling forcefully and inhaling gently.

Bathing at the Mao hour involves the spirit residing at the spine’s pivot, breath without intent, silently counting fifty-six inhalations. Bathing at the You hour involves the spirit residing at the Yellow Court, breath without purpose, silently counting twenty-four exhalations. These two hours—Mao and You—are the non-action of gentle fire in cyclic movement, where the heart is settled, aware, and illuminated, yet without action.

These are the positions of yang fire, yin tally, and bathing. The work of laying the foundation relies on this fire tally; without it, there is no root for exhausting leakage, and the yang of the horse cannot be concealed.

**Oral Secrets of Gathering the Lesser Medicine**
The preceding speaks of the verification of refining essence into qi, where the mysterious pass opens and the seed is produced. Above, breath resumes; below, the yang barrier is stirred. The jade cavern’s twin breaths blow—when the time arrives, the spirit knows. Immediately employ the oral secrets of *absorb, lick, contract, and close*.

Gather the true seed of the lesser medicine to return to the Kun furnace; the details have not been fully elucidated. Now, when the pre-heaven true unity qi stirs, one must not exit stillness. Swiftly concentrate the spirit in the qi cavity, fix the gaze, and gather the heart’s power. With single-minded focus and all distractions stilled, use the *absorb* syllable to draw upward, the *lick* syllable to press the tongue to the upper palate, the *contract* syllable to tightly seal the valley passage, and the *close* syllable to shut the three barriers—ears, eyes, and mouth.

The spirit returns within the body, the gaze fixed on the qi cavity’s mysterious pass. Use inhalation, not exhalation; inhalation merely follows. Each inhalation returns to the Qian summit, bringing the medicine to the Kun furnace. Only ascend afterward; do not descend beforehand—this is the true oral secret for gathering the true seed.

Wait until the external kidneys fully retract and shrink, then use true intent to seal and secure tightly. Proceed with the celestial mechanism of the fire tally: advance the yang fire, withdraw the yin tally, to refine and congeal, forming the greater medicine. Ingest and pass through the barriers, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood.

---

**Oral Secrets of the Original Spirit Leading the Original Qi in Ascent and Descent**
After advancing the yang fire at Zi and sealing with true intent, the original spirit leads the original qi. Visualize a wheel of the red sun ascending along the Governing Vessel. From the Kun abdomen, it rises to the Qian summit. During ascent, never descend—wait until the count of two hundred and sixteen inhalations is complete.

When withdrawing the tally at Wu, the original spirit leads the original qi. Visualize a wheel of the vast moon descending along the Conception Vessel from the Qian summit to the Kun furnace. During descent, never ascend—wait until the count of one hundred and forty-four exhalations is complete.

The ancients said: "Inverting yin and yang, the three hundred and sixty breaths of the lesser celestial cycle complete the fire timing." Then re-enter chaos, with gentle fire nurturing and silent illumination in the lower field, abiding in the extinction of all conditions. Wait only for the mysterious pass to open, the true seed to emerge, and the celestial cycle to resume.

When the true qi stirs, it relies entirely on the mastery of true intent and the urging of breath to congeal the elixir and transcend the ordinary to enter sagehood.

**Detailed Explanation of the Perils of Scattered True Intent**
Baopuzi said: The principles of the fire tally have their benefits and harms—one must know them. First, thoughts must not arise; if they do, the fire blazes. Second, intent must not scatter; if it does, the fire cools. Third, the eyes must not gaze outward; if they do, the spirit strays and the hun is harmed. Fourth, the ears must not listen outward; if they do, essence scatters and the po is harmed. Fifth, breath must not be rushed; if it is, it disperses without return. Sixth, breath must not stop; if it does, it becomes intermittent and weak.

Sudden interruptions or continuations, or alternations of heat and cold, give rise to countless harms. Without utmost care and caution against peril, there can be no success. Even if thoughts arise without outward distraction—such as a fleeting delusion during the advance of the yang fire—it is as if all has arisen.

Scattered intent need not be muddled spirit—even in the moment of kindling the fire, the slightest inattention becomes scattered intent. Outward gazing is not wanton gazing, yet frequent blinking harms the *hun*. Outward listening is not chaotic listening, yet perceiving wind or rain harms the *po*. "Sudden" does not mean violent haste; the desire for swift success is like pulling seedlings to help them grow. "Stopping" is not forced retention; the wish for effortless gain is like waiting by a tree stump for a rabbit. To eliminate these flaws, when circulating and refining the *Zhoutian*, rouse the spirit, invigorate the will, let no thought arise, no focus scatter. Inwardly, forget the self; outwardly, forget all things. Maintain reverence and sincerity, concentrate the mind, and unite the will. Let the radiance of the numinous spirit lead the *yuanqi* to circulate through the *Ren* and *Du* meridians—neither striving nor slacking, neither forgetting nor forcing.

Advancing the yang fire is like the rising of the red sun; withdrawing the yin tally is like the descent before the waxing moon. Ascend and descend at will, each movement vividly perceived—neither clinging nor detaching, neither approaching nor departing, neither slow nor hurried, neither existent nor nonexistent. Serene and unhurried, continuous and dense, empty and vast, drifting and unbounded. Swiftness avoids the flaw of skipping stages; slowness avoids the peril of stagnation. Firmness and softness achieve balance, spirit and *qi* unite, above and below merge as one, front and back follow the same path. I but align a single thought with the central Way, and naturally all is just right—perfectly measured, without excess or deficiency, free from overflow, dispersal, stagnation, or obstruction.

---

In refining the elixir, one errs either through *qi* dissipation or *qi* stagnation. The error of dissipation arises from laxity of mind or excessive speed in spirit-circulation, causing true *qi* to overflow without end and fail to ascend and descend along the central path, inevitably leading to its wandering through the meridians. The error of stagnation stems from overattachment in effort, dullness of *yuanshen*, and retention of true *qi*, preventing free circulation and harmonious flow. Thus, obstruction and stagnation arise, the *Zhoutian*’s degrees lose their proper measure, and peril ensues. Excess brings the danger of forcing the furnace to overflow; deficiency risks the shame of the tortoise-body failing to retract.

The method lies in discerning the three internal and external matters in proper sequence. First, the fire timing must be precise—aside from having no fire or timing at all, it must precisely complete the three hundred days of circulation. Second, the *ma yin* conceals its form: the tortoise-body retracts into the abdomen, utterly still, with no possibility of essence generation. True *qi* is felt only in the *yin qiao* meridian, occasionally stirring once or twice, budding within but never reaching outward. Third, the yang light appears twice, flashing like lightning between the brows—this is the exact moment to cease the fire. Without these, do not expect to attain the Dao. Cultivators must proceed with utmost care, thoroughly mastering the three oral instructions to transcend the mortal and enter the sacred while avoiding peril.

The marvelous application of civil and martial in the *Xiao Zhoutian* has not been fully expounded. During the ascent of the six yang, exhalation is civil. During the descent of the six yin, inhalation is civil. The four cardinal times of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* for bathing are also civil. Here, true intent silently illumines the lower *dantian*, the upper *dantian*, and the *Huangting* between the spine, calming the mind, nurturing nature, returning to emptiness, and resting in nonaction.

The martial aspect: during the ascent of the yang fire, inhalation is martial; during the descent of the yin tally, inhalation is also martial. Concentrate the will, focus the mind, let the *yuanshen* lead the *yuanqi* to circulate between the *Ren* and *Du* meridians—acting with purpose. Though there is action, the fire does not scorch; though there is effort, the breath leaves no trace. Only then does one align with the natural mystery of the celestial Dao. As the ancients said: "When the human mind merges with the celestial mind, true lead emerges from *Kan*—this is precisely it."

**Oral Instructions on the Celestial Mechanism of the *Xiao Zhoutian*’s Degrees**

Advancing the yang fire and withdrawing the yin tally are the postnatal breaths that stir the prenatal *qi* mechanism. Once sealing is complete, first inhale to advance the yang fire: at *zi*, thirty-six inhalations form one period. In the *chou* and *yin* periods, perform seventy-two inhalations. One period of thirty-six, three periods in total, amounting to one hundred and eight inhalations. At *mao*, bathe—spirit rests at the spine, silently counting thirty-six inhalations, aware yet without action. This is called a great rest. After completing thirty-six, proceed through the *chen* and *si* periods with seventy-two inhalations. Five yang periods total one hundred and eighty inhalations (excluding *mao*, which is bathing). If bathing is included in the count, six yang periods total two hundred and sixteen inhalations. The ancients said: "Qian uses nine," the number of four divinations and four counts—all embody the essence of breath.

In sum: four nines make thirty-six inhalations, accumulating two hundred and sixteen yang lines—this is the waxing crescent. Advancing the yang fire, spirit resides in the lower *dantian*; withdrawing the yin tally, spirit resides in the upper *dantian*. At *wu*, twenty-four exhalations form one period. In the *wei* and *shen* periods, perform forty-eight exhalations. Three periods in total amount to seventy-two exhalations. At *you*, bathe—spirit rests at the *Huangting*, silently counting twenty-four exhalations, also called a rest, aware yet without thought.

Silently counting the full twenty-four exhalations, proceed through the *wu* and *hai* periods with forty-eight exhalations. Five yin periods yield one hundred twenty exhalations, excluding the bathing count. Including the *you* period, six yin periods total one hundred forty-four exhalations. The ancients said: "Kun uses six," also the number of four divinations and four counts—likewise the function of breath. The ancients said: four sixes make twenty-four exhalations, combining to form one hundred forty-four yin lines, called the waning crescent.

The celestial cycle completes three hundred sixty degrees, where Qian’s nine and Kun’s six rotate without error—only then is the immortal Dao achieved. A deviation by a hair’s breadth leads one astray by a thousand miles. In bathing, guard against danger; I remain unclothed, all conditions emptied—what difficulty remains?

This is the eternal, unbroken celestial mechanism. Now I reveal the degrees of the celestial cycle, the secret formula for refining the elixir, to ferry all beings and fulfill my vow. Should later scholars come to know this, they must not speak of it lightly. Why did Zhang Ziyang incur three heavenly punishments? It is also said: without this fire tally, there is no principle for congealing the elixir. If the fire pearl does not manifest, there is no celestial mechanism for attaining sagehood.

Cultivators of the Dao have perused countless alchemical scriptures, yet since ancient times, the fire timing has never been transmitted. Thus, the fire timing is most revered and noble, passed mouth-to-mouth, heart-to-heart, never lightly disclosed—this secret celestial mechanism. Those who know it must not be careless.

*Note: This is Master Zhongli’s verified cultivation and realization.*

When the true yang arises and the celestial mechanism stirs, the mysterious pass opens, the true seed emerges, and bathing seals it. Advancing the fire and withdrawing the tally, the three hundred sixty degrees of the celestial cycle are fulfilled. Any excess or deficiency in progression or retreat risks harm.

Master Lü’s elixir failed three times; Master Qiu’s elixir failed four times. The fire timing is subtle—if any *qi* remains unrefined, the elixir will escape the furnace, and all prior effort is wasted. Only when the yin of the horse conceals its form, the yang gate closes, the fire is sufficient, the medicine potent, and the turtle’s head retracts—only then does the elixir radiate a fine light. This signifies the small celestial cycle’s fire is complete and the elixir ripe; one must know when to cease the fire. Yet great danger lies herein.

If the fire is ceased prematurely, the great medicine will not arise. If the fire is ceased too late, the true *qi* will not gather, and peril is certain. The turtle’s head must retract into the abdomen—this alone confirms the fire is sufficient. Even if external light appears, it is not the sprout of the great medicine but rather the manifestation of delusion.

If the fire timing is incomplete yet the yin of the horse conceals its form, the turtle’s head retracts, and the elixir radiates a fine light—like lightning flashing in the clouds or the empty chamber’s spontaneous illumination—it first appears before the brows. Over time, it ascends from the lower *dantian* to the eyes, its brilliance flashing and flickering.

At this moment, the first glimpse of yang light appears. The lightning flashes between the brows—if the yang light appears once but the fire timing is incomplete, the *yin* root has not retracted, and upon encountering yang’s arising, one must immediately refine it through one cycle. Refine it repeatedly, cycling without end, stillness upon stillness, until the full measure of three hundred celestial revolutions is complete.

Refine until the turtle retracts and does not rise, and the yang light appears a second time. In the depths of stillness, one suddenly senses the inner elixir light surging upward from the *kun* field, reaching the eyes and generating radiance. It presses open both eyes, its brilliance flashing and flickering, repeating two or three times before the refined elixir light surges forth—bright as golden coins, red as fire pearls—flowing from the corners of the eyes in a disordered stream, forming beads that roll down in a continuous two or three drops, falling upon the body with a faint sound. This marks the second appearance of yang light. As long as the turtle remains retracted and does not rise, even if vitality stirs, it will not stray outward through the kidney meridian but will instead move within the root of *qi*, causing the *qi* mechanism to sprout internally. Whether it stirs once or twice is common at this stage, but one must not resume the celestial fire. Instead, swiftly enter stillness, nurture with contained light, concentrate the spirit in silent vigil, and await only the third appearance of yang light. When the time arrives, proceed with the seven-day refinement of the great medicine, and one may ascend the immortal ranks to the Great Luo.

---

When the yang light appears a second time and the fire is sufficient, cease the fire. Though one no longer circulates the ascending and descending fire of the celestial cycle, one must not depart from the fire even for a moment. Constantly nurture and warm it, concentrating the light at every instant, awaiting the third appearance of yang light. Whether after a day or at the corresponding hour, the third yang light will surge from the *dantian*, rising to the eyes, flashing like lightning between the brows two or three times before ceasing—this is the moment the great medicine is born. It is precisely the radiant moonlight on the southwestern path.

When the yang light appears a third time, cease the fire immediately. If one fails to cease the fire, and the yang light appears a fourth time, the great medicine will escape, and all prior efforts will be wasted—truly lamentable. Practitioners of the Dao must exercise utmost care. Upon the third appearance, one must swiftly apply the fire and refine the great medicine to ensure no loss.

**Oral Instructions for Returning Spirit and Qi to the Root**
When refining the great medicine, if the spirit does not return to profound stillness, the elixir will not form. If the breath is not concealed within the *qi* cave of the primordial sea, the pearl will not manifest. Both heart and breath must be deeply hidden within the *dantian*. Even if the breath occasionally escapes, the heart must never depart. For seven days and nights without interruption, the power of the eyes and the spirit must guard the *qi* cave. Guard until the postnatal breath is concealed within the primordial sea, hidden and unmoving—then the true unity of primordial *qi* will naturally congeal into the elixir. It will resemble a fire pearl, the size of a pellet, born within the *kun* furnace.

The essence of refining the medicine lies in the yang light of the eyes fixing upon the mysterious pass, never wavering for an instant. For seven continuous days, the spirit must return to profound stillness, and the true *qi* will naturally congeal, the golden elixir will naturally form.

---

**Oral Instructions for Ceasing the Fire**
Without knowing the timing to cease the fire or the signs of refining the great medicine, success is impossible. Out of compassion for later learners, I transmit the timing for ceasing the fire: precisely when the turtle retracts and does not rise, and the yang light appears a second time. I transmit the method for refining the great medicine: precisely when the moonlight is clear and bright, and the yang light appears a third time. One must neither cease the fire too hastily upon the first sign nor delay until the fourth sign. Between haste and delay, ceasing at the second appearance and refining at the third guarantees the attainment of the dragon-tiger great elixir. This is an eternal celestial secret. Those who encounter it by fate—how can they not treasure and guard it closely?

---

**True Oral Instructions for Refining the Great Medicine**
When refining the great medicine, initially use true intent to gather and concentrate the light in the *dantian* where the mysterious pass opens. Gently and silently observe, continuously guarding it. After three days, one may intensify the effort. The power of the heart must be fully engaged, the gaze fixed. Let the breath move naturally, without deliberate control. Simply await the moment when the breath halts—then the great medicine will be born. If the breath does not halt, the great medicine will not arise.

Before the first, second, or third day, guarding too hastily will not yield the elixir. Between the fifth and sixth days, guarding too late will also fail. In the first three days, the presence may seem uncertain, as if existing yet not existing—gently and silently observe. In the latter three or four days, do not waver for an instant, like a cat stalking a mouse or a dragon nurturing its pearl. Let no thought arise, no intent scatter, and the phenomenon of the six roots trembling will manifest.

The six roots are the ears, eyes, nose, tongue, body, and intent. One must first sever the six roots before the trembling phenomenon can appear. With true intent, silently observe and guard the *qi* cave above the lower *dantian*. One must tightly seal the six roots to prevent leakage, gathering the vitality of the great medicine.

---

**Oral Instructions on the Celestial Secret of Sealing the Six Roots**
What does it mean to tightly seal the six roots?

Press downward with a wooden base to seal the perineum, so the body-root does not leak.
Seal the nostrils tightly with a nose-clamp, so the nose-root does not leak.
Concentrate the ear’s resonance and refrain from external listening, so the ear-root does not leak.
Press the lips together, the tongue to the upper palate, so the tongue-root does not leak.
Close the mouth, lower the curtains of the eyes, turn the light inward, remain utterly still, and do not let the gaze wander outward, so the eye-root does not leak.
Let no thought arise, no intent scatter, let the six desires not stir, the six dusts not defile, so the intent-root does not leak.
Once the six roots are tightly sealed, how could the great medicine fail to arise?
When spirit and *qi* do not leak, life is inevitably secured.

When the six roots do not leak, the phenomenon of the six roots trembling naturally appears.
Manifesting in sequence, one will witness the spirit governing the *qi*, the *qi* nurturing the spirit, cultivating until spirit and *qi* settle into profound stillness, returning to the true, merging as one, and coalescing into the golden elixir of the great medicine.
Naturally, the *dantian* will feel as if ablaze, the two kidneys as if simmering in broth, golden light will shine from the eyes, wind-like sounds will arise behind the ears, the brain will resound like an eagle’s cry, and the body will surge and limbs tremble, the nose twitch—all manifestations of the trembling phenomenon.
Thereafter, with true intent stabilized, true breathing ceases, and the great medicine is produced.

When the great medicine arises, within the *qi* cave there may be sensations of trembling or stirring, lasting a day or two.
Suddenly, within the *qi* cave of the *dantian*, a movement—once, twice—may be felt, accompanied by a slight ache. After several such movements, one gradually perceives an object emerging within the *dantian*, circulating and revolving around the navel.
It is the size of a pellet, hot as a fiery pearl.
Still the mind further, observe further, quiet further, settle further, until reaching the utmost emptiness and equilibrium. After spirit conceals and *qi* withdraws, it spontaneously manifests, rolling and turning, surging upward to the heart’s position.
The heart’s position does not retain it; it descends toward the yang pass. The yang pass remains closed, so it rolls and turns toward the perineum. With the wooden base sealing the perineum, it hides within the *qi* cave, lying dormant.
If one uses intent to guide it, one falls into the side path of *daoyin*.
If one does not use intent to guide it, one violates the principle of following its movement—both are errors.
Thus, neither precede nor follow, neither forget nor force, as if present yet absent.
Wait only for the great medicine to move before guiding it.
Do not guide it before it moves.
After it has moved three times, true intent and the great medicine depend on each other as they travel together, then they can penetrate the three passes and traverse the nine apertures.
Entering the *niwan* and descending into the *huangting*.
Thus it is called "ingestion."
This is the celestial secret of the Five Dragons Bearing the Sage.

When the great medicine manifests within the *qi* cave, know that below the *qi* cave, at the region of the *weilu*, there are four branching paths:
one leading upward to the heart’s position, one downward to the perineum, one forward to the yang pass, and one backward to the *weilu*.
The *weilu* pass naturally has seven apertures.
At its center, there are three apertures—upper, middle, and lower—which are the correct path of the yellow *du* meridian.
The four apertures to the left and right are the forked paths of the red *du* meridian, all filled with marrow and impervious to breath.
Each path has one aperture, hollow and open, serving as the fiery route for the circulation of *qi* and fluids.
The *weilu* and perineum, one solid and one hollow, are called the Magpie Bridge.
The *weilu* pass, *jiaji* pass, *yuzhen* pass, and the *yintang* above the nose are all filled with marrow and impervious to breath.
The two apertures below the nose are hollow and open, serving as the usual path for inhalation and exhalation.
The *yintang* and nostrils, one solid and one hollow, are called the Upper Magpie Bridge.
Both the upper and lower Magpie Bridges can leak true *qi*, so one must be cautious and guard against these perilous paths.
Thus it is said: press downward with a wooden base, seal the nostrils with a clamp, let no intent scatter, and empty all conditions—what difficulty could there be?

Know that within the hundred days of gathering and refining, and the seven days of passing the passes, there are many dangers.
The medicine arises at a specific time, when the mysterious pass opens—this is the moment.
Not recognizing the time results in missing it face-to-face—this is the danger of losing the moment.
Gathering the medicine has its proper occasion, when the jade cavern emits a double breath—this is the sign.
Not recognizing the sign means failing to obtain the true seed—this is the danger of missing the sign.
The ascent follows the posterior path, the descent the anterior path; the central *du* meridian is the yellow path, while the two sides are the red paths.
If one is confused and fails to perceive the route, this is the danger of the celestial cycle’s ascent and descent.
Advancing the fire without knowing the Kun furnace—the Kun furnace is where the fire begins, the Qian summit where the fire ends—this is the danger of advancing the fire improperly.
Retreating the tally without starting from the upper *dantian* and ending at the lower—this is the danger of retreating the tally.
If the passes and apertures are not truly opened, true *qi* may gather and then disperse. If ascent and descent do not follow the yellow path, *qi* will flow erratically throughout the body—this is the danger of passing the passes.
After the three passes are traversed, the danger lies in crossing the Upper Magpie Bridge.
After ingestion, when returning to the *huangting* to perform the seven-day great refinement, if one is not careful and vigilant, and rashly exits stillness, allowing the spirit to wander outward, the great elixir will leak at this point.

Every step forward holds many dangers. Only after three years of nursing can one avoid these dangers.
*Note: This is the verified cultivation experience of the Perfected One of Purple Yang.*

**Secret Essentials of the Great Elixir Passing the Passes**
The Pure Yang Ancestor Lü states: When the great elixir passes the passes, the golden elixir stirs three times within the *qi* cavity. Use true intent to guide the sacred embryo, ascending from the *weilü* aperture like a crawling maggot, like rising smoke, or like swirling heat. It coils upward from the waist, pressing against the *jiājí* spine. At this moment, envision the *jiājí* where red and black *qi* flank the elixir as it moves. Naturally, the fire dragon guards the right, and the water dragon guards the left. Take care not to open the pass; straighten the spine and silently guard the sacred embryo until the heat intensifies and the *qi* grows robust. Gradually open the *jiājí* and release the *qi* to pass the pass. With focused intent, the water dragon guards the left, the fire dragon guards the right, and the green dragon, white dragon, and yellow dragon escort the elixir upward. Guide it with intent until it reaches the *yùzhěn*, then tilt the head back to seal the upper pass. Silently guard the mysterious pearl, taking care not to open the pass until the heat peaks and the *qi* swells. Suddenly open the pass and, with intent, guide it into the brain palace to replenish the marrow sea of *níwán*, holding it there. This is called the "Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown." After a brief pause, you will feel sweet dew descending in the mouth, like sparrow eggs, each droplet falling like cascading syrup. Guard the nasal pass carefully, swallowing as you sense it. Pass the *chónglóu*, and with focused intent, send it into the *huángtíng*. Once the great elixir has fully descended, perform one cycle of the *mǎoyǒu* celestial orbit. Then proceed with the seven-day great refinement, dying and reviving. Thereafter, cease the practice of gathering and refining, and instead perform the minor celestial orbit. Neither advancing the fire nor retreating the tally is necessary. The seven-day secret of gathering the great elixir involves the return of the jade fluid and golden fluid elixirs, the *mǎoyǒu* celestial orbit, left ascent and right descent, and the ten-month gestation of the embryo.

**The Seven-Day Chaos Secret**
After the great elixir passes the passes and is ingested, this is called the "Great River Chariot" or "Five Dragons Bearing the Sacred." After ingesting the elixir, first perform one cycle of the *mǎoyǒu* celestial orbit to gather the great elixir. Then enter profound stillness, standing at the ultimate, and perform the seven-day great refinement. Plunge into quiescence, resting deeply for a time. For seven days of chaos, lightly abide in silent illumination, continuously present yet neither clinging nor departing. Bathe in the gentle fire, forgetting form and self. Externally, be unaware of the body; internally, be unaware of the mind. At no moment allow the slightest stray thought. Guard the center and embrace the One until you die and revive. Like awakening from sleep, the post-heaven trigram pattern is transformed, revealing the root of the prior-heaven. Without a companion to regulate water and fire, how can one preserve its wholeness?
*Note: This is the verified cultivation experience of Patriarch Xue Daoguang.*

**Dangers of Imperfectly Passing the Passes**
If the passes are not truly traversed and the elixir is ingested in confusion, true *qi* may scatter, and the primordial spirit may lack support. In genuine passage and ingestion, the central palace must exhibit fetal breathing. Amidst extraordinary perceptions in deep stillness, the *rèn* and *dū* meridians must manifest transformations—perhaps the *dū* meridian becomes a celestial ladder, the *rèn* meridian a jeweled pagoda, the central palace a cinnabar furnace, or the middle and lower *dantian* an empty vast realm, a separate heaven and earth unlike the human world. Even within a single day, dozens of wondrous visions and sounds may appear, each unique. This is the true sign of passing the passes and ingesting the elixir. If the passage is indistinct and ingestion vague, the central palace will lack true fetal breathing, the *rèn* and *dū* meridians will show no transformations, and the middle and lower *dantian* will reveal no heaven and earth or vast realm. Inevitably, all will be silent and devoid of sensation, empty and without *qi*. This is the scattering of true *qi* and the lack of support for the primordial spirit—how perilous! The formula states: When circulating the celestial orbit, be swift yet not reckless, slow yet not stagnant. Ascend behind and descend before, harmonizing the passes and apertures. If the opening is true and thorough, what danger remains?
*Note: This is the verified cultivation experience of Li Xu bai.*

**Dangers of Fire Regulation When Sweet Dew Descends**
When one truly passes the passes, at the moment of ingestion, the golden elixir descends from the upper *dantian*, and the mouth naturally feels round and radiant, a unified mass gathering on the tongue. At this moment, carefully seal the three passes of ears, eyes, and mouth, avoiding any dispersion. Await the elixir’s return to the mouth in stillness. Swallow as you sense it, sending it down the *chónglóu* to return to the central palace, then perform one cycle of the *mǎoyǒu* celestial orbit. Immediately concentrate the spirit and enter quiescence, nurturing it for seven days in profound chaos, so the sacred embryo may congeal. If, upon the elixir’s entry into the central palace, you do not swiftly concentrate the spirit and enter quiescence to apply the fire of embryo formation, the fetal breathing will lack a master and remain inert. Even if you later enter quiescence and apply the fire, it will never be called a spiritual embryo. If, in quiescence, the spirit often wanders, it will repeatedly separate and reunite, making it difficult to fulfill the ten-month fruition. If, after ten months, the fruit remains unfulfilled, it will become a phantom embryo, and the yang spirit will not manifest. Thus it is said: Refine the self before refining the returning elixir. Only after refining the self to purity can the elixir return, achieving a heart dead and spirit alive. In nurturing the embryo, avoid the peril of intermittent separation and reunion. For the first hundred days, the spirit and *qi* must merge as one without parting. If they separate and reunite, the fire will not become fire, and the embryo will not become an embryo. For the middle hundred days, the spirit and *qi* must fully enter great quiescence.

To take non-breath as breath and non-fire as fire—only then is it true breath and true fire. If one still perceives breath and cannot stabilize, or still senses fire while aware of its application, one has not entered the realm of emptiness and extinction, the great quiescence of annihilation. The flaw of the phantom embryo remains unavoidable.

If, in guarding the embryonic breath, one clings to the act of guarding, this very clinging gives rise to delusive thoughts. If one refrains from firing altogether, one loses the true principle of firing. This is mere stillness without movement, mere emptiness without transformation, falling into the fruit of minor attainment.

Within the first hundred days, one must practice the work of utmost extinction and extreme quiescence. Without the vision of the spirit’s emergence, one must not entertain the thought of its departure, nor allow the mind to cling to perceptions, leaving quiescence to exit stillness. Otherwise, even after ten months of diligent effort, one will only achieve the minor fruit of corpse liberation, making it difficult to transcend the embryo, transform the spirit, ascend, and soar.

**Note:** This is the experiential verification of refining and returning the yang.

When the great medicine reaches the crown, it tests the celestial mechanism. The Five Dragons uphold the sacred; if the great medicine is lost, as in one with robust *qi*, it may strike through the three barriers in a single surge, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace. For those with weak *qi*, it must take three attempts to reach the crown. Once the three barriers are passed and the medicine ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, the nine yang *qi* rise to the nine heavens above. The head feels as if struck by thunder, the body like melting sesame—floating as if riding the wind, boundless joy. The face tingles as if spiders crawl and ants march, an itch begging to be scratched. This sensation spreads to the glabella, then to the bridge of the nose, eye sockets, cheekbones, and jaws. The mouth fills with overflowing saliva, impossible to swallow entirely. At this moment, the mouth seals lazily, the body sinks into torpor, entering primordial chaos, dissolving into nothingness—unaware even of where the body resides. Breath naturally ceases, pulses halt, true *qi* fills the body, and hunger vanishes.

In the first month, if breath and pulse do not cease, grain is not cut off, though one may reduce intake. By the third month, grain is naturally forsaken; after the fourth month, one permanently abstains from cooked food—this is true fasting. Thus it is said: *When qi is full, one does not think of food.* If grain is not cut off, yin *qi* remains difficult to dissolve. If yin *qi* does not dissolve, yang is not pure. If one still craves food, one remains a mortal bound to birth and death, lacking steadfastness—this cannot be called *qi* fullness.

Only when the work of quiescent illumination is diligently pursued does one naturally reach the state where the spirit is full and sleep is unneeded, *qi* is abundant and hunger forgotten. At this stage, the heart knows no arising or ceasing, ever quiescent yet ever luminous. Breath has no exit or entry, neither coming nor abiding. One only perceives a sphere of auspicious light within the realm of neither existence nor non-existence—this is the sign of the congealed embryo, akin to being in the womb. Even if gongs clang and drums resound, one remains unaware. At this time, companions must safeguard and support; after twenty-one days, it is proper to awaken the practitioner. If not awakened, the primordial spirit may depart in stillness, falling into the wheel of rebirth. One must guide it from the Yin Heel Vessel—the *qi* cavity.

Gently patting the back or calling the practitioner’s name may restore them to life. When the work reaches this point, the glabella naturally radiates a moon-like light. One need only guard the center with a dead heart, embracing oneness—this light will naturally shine between the brows, like lightning flashing. At this moment, life and destiny are firm. From this point, primordial *qi* cannot leak from the heart, enabling longevity in the world.

The hundred days of foundation-laying, the myriad ancient and unspoken celestial mechanisms of the celestial revolution—today I reveal them. The oral secrets of a thousand buddhas’ hidden treasuries are now fully disclosed. If one receives the guidance of an enlightened teacher, direct transmission, one may transcend the mortal and enter the sacred, ascending to the Heaven of Great Purity.

The sky is clear, the golden rooster crows;
I now take the medicine to seek long life.
No hunger, no thirst—
I rely on the efficacy of the immortal’s elixir.

Lead and mercury dwell within the crucible,
Refined into a priceless pearl.
All comes down to two words—
They resolve the books of ten thousand households.
This is the primordial imperial secret,
Delivering all the lost in the world.

**Note:** This is the experiential verification of the Patriarch of True Yang.

*The Heart Seal Scripture on the Work of Returning Wind and Merging Unity*

"Returning wind" refers to reversing the breath, the metaphor of *qi*. "Merging unity" means that while the primordial spirit resides in the heart and primordial *qi* in the kidneys—originally far apart—when *qi* arises and rushes outward, the spirit, though aware, cannot act without the method of merging. Thus, this scripture teaches one to use the breath to reverse the *qi*, guiding spirit and *qi* to return to the root and restore life, merging them. Only then can the spirit govern the *qi*, uniting them as one. Without the wondrous function of returning wind, even if the spirit governs the *qi*, one remains unaware whether the *qi* has truly submitted. This is the most secret and essential method for refining the golden elixir.

If one asks about the work of a hundred days, the numinous signs will already be manifest, *qi* will be sufficient and can stabilize, the spirit will be accustomed to quiescence and can stabilize. Thus, the fire of the minor celestial revolution’s returning wind method should cease. From this point onward, all refers to the cessation of fire when the minor celestial revolution’s fire is sufficient.

It is also said: *Do not divide midnight and noon by the hour; within the unchanging hexagrams, fix the qian and kun.* Commentary on *The Scripture of Embryonic Breath*

The embryo forms from the cultivation of latent *qi*.
Three inches below the navel lies the *qi* sea, also called the lower cinnabar field, the mysterious female. Most people mistakenly take the mouth and nose as the mysterious female—they are but the gates of its entry and exit. The mysterious (*xuan*) is water; the female (*pin*) is mother. People, through the mutual stimulation of yin and yang *qi*, congeal in the water mother. After three months, the embryo forms; after ten, the body is complete, and a human is born.

The cultivator constantly subdues *qi* below the navel, guards the spirit within the body. When spirit and *qi* merge, the mysterious embryo is born.

Once the mysterious embryo is formed, it generates the body of its own—this is the Dao of the inner elixir and immortality. The breath now rests within the embryo. Spirit is the child of *qi*; *qi* is the mother of spirit. Spirit and *qi* pursue one another like form and shadow. When the embryonic mother is formed, the spirit-child breathes of itself, and *qi* no longer scatters. *Qi* entering the body brings life; spirit departing the form brings death.

*The Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "The body is the dwelling of spirit; spirit is the master of the body. When the master is tranquil, spirit abides within; when the master is restless, spirit departs." If spirit departs and *qi* scatters, how can life be preserved? Thus, a person’s ears, eyes, hands, and feet cannot move of themselves—they must be governed by spirit. Those who study the Dao and cultivate life constantly restrain their spirit, making it the master. If the master does not depart, how can the dwelling crumble?

Knowing that spirit and *qi* can bring long life, one firmly guards emptiness and non-being to nurture them. *The Scripture of the Dao* says: "My life is in my own hands, not in Heaven and Earth. What Heaven and Earth fear is that people cannot know this. The supreme Dao can be known but not practiced." Those who know need only empty the mind, sever thoughts, preserve *qi*, and nourish essence. Not being drawn by external realms of desire and attachment, they cultivate tranquility to nurture spirit and *qi*—thus is the Dao of long life complete.

Where spirit moves, *qi* moves; where spirit rests, *qi* rests. This is what is meant by "intention is the steed of *qi*, movement and stillness follow one another." To ensure primordial *qi* does not leave the mysterious female, first restrain and guard the supreme spirit. If spirit does not leave the body, *qi* will not scatter, and naturally, one will be inwardly full, neither hungry nor thirsty.

If one desires long life, spirit and *qi* must interflow. This interflow means spirit and *qi* do not separate. *The Mysterious Principles* states: "If the yang *qi* of the silkworm is not extinguished, it does not become a ghost; if the yin *qi* of the spider is not cultivated, it does not become an immortal." Primordial *qi* is yang *qi*; food *qi* is yin *qi*. Constantly reducing food and restraining desire allows primordial *qi* to circulate within. If primordial *qi* is strong, yin *qi* naturally dissipates. When yang is robust and yin declines, the hundred diseases do not arise. With spirit at peace and the body joyful, one may hope for long life.

When the mind does not stir thoughts, there is no coming or going, no exiting or entering—naturally, it abides constantly. Spirit and *qi*, within the mother’s womb, were originally one substance. After birth, they are drawn by external realms of desire and attachment, never for a single breath returning to their original state. Knowing this Dao, one constantly extinguishes emotional thoughts, preventing spirit from exiting, entering, coming, or going. By not forgetting this and practicing it over time, spirit naturally abides. Diligently practicing this is the true path.

The Dao of cultivating truth is fully encompassed here, yet the words of the sages must not be sought recklessly. After practicing embryonic breathing, the joints open, and the hair flows freely. One then gently draws *qi* through the nose, allowing it to follow and exit through the pores of the four limbs, never to return. When *qi* arrives again, one draws it in but does not exhale. This must be done slowly and gently. Though it is said "draw in but do not exhale," the *qi* drawn does not enter the throat but disperses subtly. In this way, the inner *qi* also flows downward and scatters.

*Inscription on Embryonic Breathing*
Thirty-six swallows, one swallow leads the way.
Exhale only in the finest threads, inhale only in unbroken strands.
Whether sitting or lying, walking or standing, remain at ease.
Avoid clamor and disturbance, shun the rank and the fragrant.
Though called embryonic breathing, it is truly the inner elixir.
Not merely for curing illness, it decisively extends the years.
Practice it long and diligently—your name will be listed among the highest immortals.

Viewing flowers is easy, embroidering them is hard;
When embroidery grows difficult, do not shrink from toil.
In conduct and in life, flaws abound;
Yet through trials unyielding, one becomes a Buddha or immortal.
Bend not through a hundred setbacks—become a sage or worthy.
Contending for fame and profit seldom brings perfection.
Wait until the mists in empty space disperse,
Then raise your brow and breathe free beneath the azure sky.

Dare not shrink from labor when honing your edge;
At dawn unseal the casket, the jade Dragon Spring.
In hand, *qi* congeals like three feet of ice;
On stone, spirit coils like a single serpent.
Dark blood silently follows flowing water away;
Vicious obstinacy now dissolves with festering wounds.
Leveling the world’s injustices,
Together we shall ascend to the Nine Heavens.

*Two Poems Presented to the Sword Immortal*

The Three Clarities’ sword technique wondrously connects to the numinous,
Severing demons and slaying spirits without a trace.
Self-snowed, it fills the sky, floating the Great White;
The Azure Dragon leaves the earth, coursing through empty space.
Soaring ten thousand leagues to the easternmost limit,
It transforms into a long rainbow descending to the northern sea.
Moving freely without hindrance,
It returns to guard the Yellow Court as before.

Swordsmanship like yours enters the subtlest depths;
Wielding divine skill, you soar through the azure void.
Spring and autumn *qi* unite in life and death;
Dragon and Tiger, both wield virtue and might.
Severing all demonic radiance, you delight in purity;
Drunk, the fumes of wine stand towering.
Soon you shall command lightning—
The Heavenly August Emperor summons your return.

*Tenth Month: Nurturing the Embryo*

The next stage, the work of refining *qi* into spirit, is called "Mid-Completion: Nurturing the Embryo."
Wei Boyang said: When nurturing the embryo, one must dwell in secluded stillness, shut away in quiet cultivation, far from chickens, dogs, and women, avoiding defilement and offense. Let no sound arise nearby.
In nurturing the embryo, take the primordial spirit as the embryo-immortal’s bones, and the Great Medicine as its flesh. Take the primordial spirit as the master of the Great Medicine, and the Great Medicine as the dwelling of the primordial spirit.
If the primordial spirit presides but no Great Medicine is ingested, though one may enter samadhi and project spirit, one cannot shed the embryo and manifest form. If the Great Medicine is ingested but the primordial spirit does not preside, though one may open the passes and penetrate the apertures, the effect will be gained and lost in turn.
Only after ingesting the Great Medicine, with the primordial spirit as its master and the Great Medicine as its refuge, do they merge without confusion.
First, one must return the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, four limbs, and hundred bones entirely to emptiness—like one who has not yet been born, with nothing to rely upon. A single spark of numinous emptiness abides within the Central Palace of the Cinnabar Field. Warm and nurture it, as if present yet absent, neither existing nor non-existing, ever still yet ever luminous, radiant and unwavering, majestically alone.
The ancients said: "The firing times accord with non-doing, matching nature; the true fire of nature nurtures the embryo-immortal."
With no idle thoughts, long abide in centered oneness. Naturally, yang *qi* arises day by day, coursing along the correct path, transmuting the yin within spirit. Yin spirit gradually fades, and thoughts do not arise. Life is spirit—ever more flourishing, ever more luminous—until sleep vanishes entirely, and one may dwell in the world forever.

*Secret Oral Instructions on Settling Spirit in the Ancestral Aperture and Using Qi*

Xu Guaiyang the Perfected Lord said: The esoteric teaching of the ten-month embryo nurturing is to settle the primordial spirit within the Ancestral Aperture, returning obscurely and profoundly to the Great Void, as if present yet absent, neither existing nor non-existing, nurtured by the civil fire. Harmonize it to the center, avoiding the perils of dryness or chill.
If it errs toward dryness, there is danger of fire scorching meditation, and the yang spirit will have no refuge. It lies entirely in the space between awareness and non-thought. For thought stirs the fire, and unawareness chills it. Chilled fire risks the peril of jade pillars drooping from the nose, leading to corpse liberation through seated transformation.
Always maintain true intent without scattering; contain the light in silence. True breathing is unbroken, still yet alert. Spirit-light shines universally—this is the true firing time of the ten-month embryo nurturing.
Balancing medicinal substances is profoundly attuned to the firing times’ ebb and flow, yet most difficult to practice.
The ancients said: "True intent comes and goes without interruption; knowing yet not clinging is the work."
Know that the elixir is formed in the *qi* cavity, and the embryo is nurtured in the Yellow Court, which resides at the body’s center. The Yellow Court is the numinous cavern of emptiness. If the elixir is formed in the lower field yet the furnace and tripod are not moved to the middle field, one will inevitably manifest as a yin spirit, becoming a ghost-immortal.

*Heavenly Mechanism of Seven-Day Seclusion and Yin-Water Revival*

The Old Man of the Sea of Bitterness said: When the Five Dragons bear the Sage and the Great Medicine passes the barrier, sweet dew descends. After ingestion, one must undertake the seven-day great seclusion.
Exclude external thoughts; prevent internal thoughts from arising. Within right mindfulness, know only the primordial spirit’s gentle, still illumination—utterly unaware of breathing’s unbroken ebb and flow. Only then does one accord with the civil fire’s nurturing, neither existing nor non-existing.
The mechanism of embryo nurturing requires the primordial spirit’s constant presiding illumination; otherwise, primordial *qi* cannot daily return to life. If one truly achieves spirit-seclusion and *qi*-concealment, sinking deeply into profound stillness, the seven-day great seclusion resembles death by cessation of breath. After seven days, the mechanism of revival returns, and jade liquid is restored as before. This is called "Seven Returns, Nine Reversions."
If one remains unresponsive after seven days, strike a bell or bowl near the ear, gently rub and pat the back, call the name, or press the Yin Heel Point—naturally, yang will return. At this time, do not emerge from stillness, lest the fire cool and elixir power wane.
The Yin Heel Point is the Gate of Life, the *qi* cavity.
If one does not awaken after seven days, the primordial spirit may depart the dwelling in stillness, falling into the six paths of rebirth. The world mistakes this for corpse liberation through seated transformation, not realizing the truth—all prior effort is then wasted.

**Oral Secrets of the Golden Elixir’s Return**

The Three Mao Immortals say: Nurturing the embryo relies chiefly on entering samādhi. If stillness persists for days, one naturally senses a wisp of warm *qi* within the Kan (Water) trigram, surging toward the heart’s locus. With true intent, guide it past the coccyx, through the spine’s pass, and into the Jade Pillow. It enters the Muddy Pellet, as though something brushes the brain. From the upper palate, it descends into the mouth drop by drop, resembling a sparrow’s egg, tasting like yang’s clarified butter. It transforms into golden liquid, trickling like dripping water, fragrant as *ghee*, sweet as ambrosia. Swiftly welcome it with intent, slowly swallow it down the Tower of Nine Stories, and escort it with the gaze into the crucible. It suffuses the four limbs—bliss resides within. For nine consecutive days, the swallowing continues unbroken. After one such cycle, circulate the *qi* through the *Mao-You* Microcosmic Orbit to gather it. Once fully collected, hasten into quiescent samādhi, nurturing stillness unto extinction—this is the subtle marvel of the lesser Kan-Li (Water-Fire) union.

**Oral Secrets of the Jade Liquid’s Return**

Ancestral Master Zhang Sanfeng says: Thereafter, one gradually enters profound samādhi. At times, the sun and moon halt their turning, the celestial pivot ceases. When utter darkness and chaos reach their zenith, the celestial mechanism stirs of itself. Suddenly, the Kun (Earth) palace resounds like thunder; the abdomen feels as though silk is tearing. True *qi* surges upward, circulating through the Six Voids, flying into the Muddy Pellet. The Moon Grotto stirs a breeze; the brows radiate a halo of light. It transforms into jade liquid, descending into the mouth—fragrant as camphor, cool as peppermint. As it is sensed, swallow it at once, letting it trickle down the Tower of Nine Stories. With true intent, escort it into the Central Palace. For seven days, the swallowing continues unceasingly. Each cycle concludes by circulating the *qi* through the *Mao-You* Microcosmic Orbit to gather it. Once the jade liquid fully descends, promptly settle the spirit into samādhi, guarding the center and embracing the One. The visions of golden liquid and jade dew arise from extreme stillness, stirred within the mindless—never let them slip away. This is the subtle marvel of the greater Kan-Li union.

---

**Oral Secrets of the *Mao-You* Microcosmic Orbit**

Ancestral Master Zhongli says: When a drop of golden liquid or jade dew falls from the Upper Field into the Yellow Court, swiftly circulate it through the *Mao-You* Microcosmic Orbit to gather it. With true intent and the gaze’s light, ascend from the Kun navel to the Qian (Heaven) crown on the left, descend on the right—four by nine, thirty-six cycles, then stabilize. Then ascend on the right, descend on the left—four by six, twenty-four cycles, then stabilize. These are the degrees of the *Mao-You* Microcosmic Orbit. As the sun and moon ascend and descend, gather all true yang, vanquish the nine yin—this is called “collecting the inner medicine to secure the embryonic garden.” When the fire tally of the Macrocosmic Orbit is complete, the sun and moon halt their turning, and naturally a grain of mysterious pearl appears, transcending the mundane.

It is also said: After the golden liquid and jade dew ascend posteriorly and descend anteriorly each day, upon each descent, circulate them once through the *Mao-You* Microcosmic Orbit to gather them. When the elixir’s return is complete, breathing naturally ceases, the pulse halts, and the vision of the sun and moon conjoined appears—this is the true verification of the elixir radiating its luminous essence.

---

**Oral Secrets of the Sun-Moon Conjunction**

True Man Ziyang says: After the elixir’s return, return to the Central Palace to warm and nurture the sacred embryo. With prolonged steaming, if one sits in extreme stillness, losing awareness of the world, breath vanishing, the six pulses all stilled—within this great samādhi, one suddenly feels a wind descending from the heavens, pouring into the Muddy Pellet. It penetrates both eyes, coursing through the entire body, opening every joint. The bones feel severed; the heart chills like ice; the cinnabar field burns like fire—do not fear. Simply settle the spirit into samādhi—this is the moment of Metal-Wood union. When the three palaces are full of *qi*, the two *qi* are replete, and spirit and *qi* profoundly stabilize, one feels as though in a drunken dream. Ten thousand fires and waters, a thousand thunderclaps, myriad rays of rosy dawn—only deaden the heart, settle the spirit into samādhi. With time, when stillness reaches its zenith, the true lead’s *qi* transforms into the image of a bright moon; the true mercury’s *qi* transforms into the form of a red sun. This is the mutual attraction of lead and mercury.

Within stillness, a bright moon suddenly appears before the eyes, flickering and unstable—use true intent to retain and await it. Before long, within three to five breaths, a sun’s radiance emerges, approaching to merge with the moonlight. Within the sun-moon’s conjoined light, two golden flowers bloom, resembling immortal elixirs, golden-red in hue, with five distinct petals—this is the three flowers uniting into embryonic breathing, called “Jade Bud, Golden Flower.” Upon witnessing this vision, firmly grasp the thought. Let the sunlight and moonlight accompany each other to a single place, suspended above the glabella. Then mobilize true intent to gather and concentrate them, sealing them within. Inhale through the nose into the *Xu-Wei* cavity of the cinnabar field, then let them ascend posteriorly and descend anteriorly, returning to the Central Palace to merge with the immortal embryo. Swiftly circulate them through the *Mao-You* Microcosmic Orbit—ascend left, descend right; ascend right, descend left—employing the work of gathering to collect them. Then enter stillness, sinking into extinction, returning to the Great Void, so the elixir’s light at the glabella shines ceaselessly day and night. This is called “the sacred sun’s firmness and the moon’s illumination, shining upon the Golden Court.”

---

**Oral Secrets of Refining the Form with True Fire**

Ancestral Master Zhang Sanfeng says: After the sun-moon conjunction, a great trial arises. Within great samādhi, one suddenly feels the *Yongquan* point beneath the right sole turn icy cold, with pain ascending through the leg, piercing the knee, and reaching the space between the two kidneys—this lasts three days, called “Sprout Piercing the Knee.” Only when the pain reaches its peak, penetrating the Mysterious Orifice and passing through the spine to the Muddy Pellet, draw the red sun at the glabella into the Central Palace, then descend it to the cinnabar field. With intent, guide it to the painful spot, and with the gaze’s light, encircle it once—the red light coalesces like a fire pearl, reversing its ascent from the coccyx. Alternatively, emit the true fire of *Samādhi* to attack it.

At this moment, the joints throughout the body crackle like roasting beans, bursting open in ceaseless explosions, while flesh and bone burn as if sliced by a blade. Even the stoutest hero is left utterly helpless. Attack again and again—after three assaults, the *qi* of the three hundred and sixty joints surges straight into the *Muddy Pellet*, and with a thunderous crash in the head, the crown opens. Now, like an eagle seizing a hare or a cat pouncing on a mouse, the lead dragon and mercury tiger lock in a death grip, the head as hard as stone, the belly as scorching as a furnace—indescribable. The blood and *qi* of the entire body seem to speak, clamoring in tumult within. Suddenly, sweet dew descends; gather a spark of divine fire and concentrate it in the Central Palace of *Jiaogan*, where golden and jade fluids coalesce into a millet-sized dark pearl. As it descends to the *Yellow Court*, one inwardly observes the five viscera and six bowels as if illuminated by a candle, feeling the body ablaze from earth to heaven, all suffused with crimson light. The *qi* flows and fills, transforming into a body of pure yang. At this moment, the self has no control—take care not to succumb to fear, for this is the yin spirit resisting the descent of true yang, manifesting as myriad illusory realms to obstruct the heart’s resolve on the Dao. Only by remaining utterly still and sinking into great samādhi will the ten thousand demons retreat. Swiftly focus between the brows, visualizing a black orb roaring to the size of a fist, its cold *qi* pressing upon you. Draw it with intent into the Central Palace, and naturally, it will feel like sweet dew dripping into the heart, bringing cool clarity and ease. This is the scene of obtaining the medicine in the tenth month of gestation. Mark the day well: the day the dark pearl and great medicine are attained is when the man conceives the embryo.

To proceed further, one must guard the center and embrace oneness, entering samādhi for a hundred days in a quiet chamber. Externally, no *qi* clings; internally, no thoughts arise. Body and emptiness become one, holding fast to the single luminous nature of spirit. Concentrate on the middle and lower cinnabar fields day and night without wavering, merging into a vast, empty realm. After five to seven days, the heart settles and the *qi* harmonizes. The great barrier opens—here, the work is complete.

**The Pearl Falls into the Yellow Court**
Ancestral Master Lan says: After the golden and jade fluids return as the elixir, the sun and moon halt their revolutions, the *Xuanji* ceases its motion, lead is exhausted and mercury dried. Then, within the *Qian* crucible, golden essence fills the crown, silver currents surge to the heavens, fire gathers and gold is borne, fiercely refined with urgent heat. In an instant, dragon and tiger wage war, the golden furnace scatters its fire, yellow sprouts cover the earth, and naturally, a millet-sized dark pearl appears. Nurtured over time, it gradually grows larger, its color like a tangerine. One must employ the true fire within and without to urge it into the *Yellow Court*, descending into the earthen cauldron. The mechanism of movement is thus stabilized, and the illusory transformations are thereby settled. Across a hundred thousand myriad kalpas, all beings possess this single primordial treasure pearl, by which they may transcend.

What is this treasure pearl? It is the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl, yang embracing yin’s spirit, uniting in the upper field; lead essence and mercury marrow congealing like a tangerine. At this moment, the dark pearl manifests within the *Qian* crucible, the dross gone and gold remaining. Externally, it draws upon the divine fire of the sun; internally, it gathers the true fire of *samādhi*. With internal and external assaults, a single drop of golden fluid once more falls into the *Yellow Court*. Upon witnessing this true effect, perform the *mao-you* microcosmic orbit to gather it. Once gathered, concentrate the spirit and enter samādhi, beginning the embrace of fetal breathing. Thereafter, it gradually grows and brightens, its color deepening in brilliance—only the mechanism of stillness remains. The mechanism is established by me; transformation arises from the mechanism. One mechanism gives rise to ten thousand transformations, and the dark pearl becomes the ancestor of all manifestations.

This dark pearl seems to exist externally, yet with eyes closed, it is distinctly visible. It seems to reside within, yet with eyes open, it is perfectly clear. Truly, there is something neither internal nor external, penetrating the hidden and obscure, threading through yin and yang, and serving as the ancestor of all transformations. The pearl falling into the *Yellow Court* is the true work and verification of illuminating the mind and seeing one’s nature.

**Returning to the Root and Restoring Life**
Master *Zhiyi* says: After the pearl falls into the *Yellow Court*, one must concentrate the spirit, still the heart, and enter samādhi. As previously stated, one knows only the original spirit, lightly and silently illuminating, utterly unaware of the ceaseless ebb and flow of breath—this accords with the principle of neither existence nor non-existence. If, in sitting to the utmost stillness of samādhi, one becomes insensible, breath entirely absent, the six pulses stilled, a minor stillness lasting a day leaves one in a state of primordial chaos, as if the breath had ceased and the body died. A medium stillness of three days, a great stillness of seven days—do not mistake this for *zuohua* (sitting transformation). This is the time when spirit and *qi* return to the root and restore life, the beginning of nurturing the embryo and cultivating the original. It is essential to have companions for protection, taking utmost care not to disturb the yang spirit of the practitioner. The cultivator must also not move with the mechanism or rashly emerge from stillness. Rather, when the breath ceases, concentrate the spirit and enter great samādhi, where one will perceive the primordial *qi* arising from emptiness.

The ancients said: Humans have life and death because they have breath. Without breath, there is no life or death. The absence of breath is entry into samādhi; with breath stilled, the embryo stabilizes like a mountain. After long practice, a minor stillness of a hundred days, a medium stillness of two hundred days, a great stillness of three hundred days—all phenomena arise and transform in emptiness. Day and night, concentrate the spirit in the foundation, and the divine elixir will coalesce in emptiness. If one cannot enter samādhi and return to emptiness, there will never be a principle for forming the elixir.

**The Great Celestial Orbit with Breath Hibernating**
The True Man of *Zuoxuan* says: When first practicing the fire times of the great celestial orbit, the spirit settles and breath halts, body and mind enter samādhi—this is the hibernation of breath, lasting eighty or ninety breaths, half a quarter-hour for one cycle.

Gradually advancing into the great samādhi, hibernation extends to one hundred or ninety breaths, a quarter-hour for one cycle. When hibernation reaches one thousand three hundred fifty breaths, one *shi* in duration, it is called one "strike." At thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, one day in duration, it is called one cycle. As one enters profound samādhi, a cycle may last ten days or a month, or even a hundred days or ten months, where the primordial spirit and primordial *qi* merge with the breath’s *qi*, all transforming into a single sphere of numinous radiance. Without day or night, it shines ceaselessly and brightly. The solar essence and lunar spirit halt their revolutions like a life on the verge of expiration—yet after this cessation, life revives, and the alchemical work manifests its transformations. As if dead, one later experiences the proof of rebirth: this is the true *zi* hour of establishing destiny. When lead and mercury fuse, all thoughts grow still, and one enters the aperture of primordial chaos. If even slightly careless in vigilant guarding, the spirit departs the aperture, and the elixir escapes the crucible—here lies the moment of either preserving or harming life. To still the heart and enter samādhi, concentrating the spirit within the aperture, is the crucial oral instruction.

The ancients said: "At first, a single thought set in motion plunged one into the sea of suffering. Now, a single thought of mastering stillness ferries one across to the other shore." The cycle of birth and death is all a matter of a single thought. Initially, if the fire is not fierce in swift refinement, the dry metal cannot emerge from the ore. Later, if the spirit-fire is not gentle in prolonged nurturing, the metal cannot transform. The four great postures dissolve all attachments. Constantly turn the light inward, observe within at every moment. When the fire times are fulfilled, the moon of inherent nature shines in the sky, and yin is exhausted while yang is pure.

**Detailed Explanation of Perilous Demon States**
Bai Letian said: When one enters the chamber to practice, the three *hun* and seven *po*, the three divisions and nine luminaries, the three corpses and nine worms, the five viscera and six bowels—all the yin spirits within the body—cannot endure stillness. At the extreme of samādhi, they transform into illusory visions: one may see red serpents, the Queen Mother’s phoenix-and-dragon chariot, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, scenes beyond count. Celestial masters, immortals, jade maidens, and perfected officials appear with celestial music. Strange birds and beasts manifest in bizarre forms. Pairs of immortal maidens approach to discourse on the Dao. Fair-faced scholars engage in dialogue. Canopies of pearls and treasures beckon and guide. Heavenly scriptures and sacred texts descend in proclamation. Parents, spouses, and children from past and future lives transform in myriad ways, testing in endless guises. To recognize them is to enter the demon’s den, to be lured by demons, and all prior effort is wasted. One must lower the eyelids, seal the senses, and still the heart without movement—then the myriad demons will retreat of themselves. At times, opening the eyes to emit the spirit’s light, flashing and dazzling, becomes one’s sword of wisdom. With focused intent, draw it back into the *qi* cavity. Remain profoundly still, neither seeing nor hearing. No matter how the demonic illusions arise to disturb, pay them no heed. Uphold right awareness, and the demonic visions will naturally disperse. If one’s wisdom stirs with exultation, singing and dancing, uttering wild words, composing poems, discoursing on mysteries, or claiming to have attained the supreme Dao—know that these are the tricks of the *shen* of consciousness, the three drums playing their games. If even the slightest joy, anger, sorrow, or fear arises, it is a sign the spirit has wavered. Weeping then laughing, joy turning to grief—all indicate the primordial spirit has stirred and failed to guard the cinnabar field, being manipulated by the three corpses. One must urgently restrain this, forcefully re-enter samādhi, and refuse to indulge such madness. Remain vigilant at every moment, grasp the practice firmly, to avoid falling into the demon’s den and ruining one’s cultivation.

Should one see a white-haired elder riding a dragon or deer, calling one’s name, reject it with the heart—never respond to the voice. If the Three Officials come to examine merits and demerits, or ancestral kin endure torment, reject it with the heart—never allow sorrow, fear, or pity to arise. If taken as real, one will awaken as if from a dream, and all progress in cultivation will be lost—how truly lamentable!

**Perilous Mechanism of Rising Yin Waters**
Huang Shigong said: For those nurturing the embryo in samādhi, if water arises during stillness and cannot be dispelled, it is because the natural breath has faltered, the primordial spirit has not guarded its abode, the nurturing warmth was insufficient, and the cinnabar field’s fire has grown cold, so the elixir no longer shines. Thus, these yin demonic visions appear. Though their transformations are manifold, they all derive from water imagery, and the elixir in the Yellow Court vanishes. The method lies in gathering one’s samādhi true fire to refine it. Concentrate the spirit in the central palace, focus attention on embryonic breathing. Direct the gaze’s light steadily, kindle the fire with breath, and with intent, visualize a sphere of true fire, its flames roaring, filling the crucible with divine radiance that illuminates the entire body. Steaming intensely on all sides, the yin demonic illusions will naturally dissolve, and the elixir’s light in the central palace will shine again.

**Perilous Mechanism of Rising Yin Fire**
Li Xu’an said: For those nurturing the embryo, if fire suddenly arises during still samādhi and cannot be extinguished, this affliction often stems from consuming foods that stir fire, or bathing in hot water, which activates the elixir fire, causing its light to flow and flames to scorch the body. The illusory visions are also manifold, but all derive from fire imagery. One may feel heart heat, restlessness, and unquenchable thirst. If unchecked, this leads to the same peril as the elixir’s escape. The oral instruction says: Visualize a black sphere the size of a fist before you, then with true intent, gather and hold it. Imagine this scene as cold as ice. With focused intent, inhale, then turn the light inward, guiding it into the central palace.

And the perverse fire naturally dissipates, the mind-ground naturally becomes cool and refreshing. Visualize the black sphere before you, drawing it into the central palace—whether three times or five times, continue until the heat and perverse fire are entirely dispelled. From this point onward, one attains peace and tranquility, with a clear spirit and vibrant qi, ensuring no loss occurs.

**The Sixfold Supernormal Perception**
Luozhuangyuan the Perfected One said: After the six roots tremble and the sun and moon conjoin, there arises the verification of the sixfold supernormal perception. Profoundly entering great samādhi, one merges into primordial chaos, unaware, until the aperture of the heart suddenly opens wide. Gazing upward at the heavens, looking downward into hell, the three realms and ten directions are beheld in their entirety—this is the divine eye. One hears all sounds across the ten directions as if they were at one’s ear, the voices of gods and humans above and below—this is the divine ear. Gradually entering great samādhi, spiritual awareness emerges, enabling knowledge of the hidden and subtle matters within the minds of all beings across the ten directions—this is the knowledge of others’ minds. One further knows the causes of one’s own past and future lives, spanning countless kalpas—this is the knowledge of past lives. With stillness deepening into quiescence, the heart-flower suddenly blooms, foreseeing fortune and misfortune, perceiving objects through walls, and discerning the whereabouts of wind, clouds, thunder, and rain—this is the divine power of transformation. Combined with the earlier refinement of essence to prevent leakage, reaching the stage of "the horse’s yin concealed," this is the extinction of outflows. Together, they are called the six supernormal perceptions, which are the transformations following the gathering of the great medicine and the trembling of the six roots.

**Refining the Form in True Emptiness**
Master Ge the Immortal said: For those nurturing the embryo in samādhi, if the body feels fatigued, the chest pierced with pain and distension, and one vomits three to five bowls of purple blood, the illness will gradually recede—no need for alarm. This stems from past exertion that injured the heart-blood. Thereafter, all chronic and deep-seated ailments will dissolve without exception. One may experience stabbing pain in the navel, both flanks as if pierced by awls, the six viscera as if torn like silk, or the brain as if split by a great axe. The heart may feel disoriented, with restlessness in sitting and lying, and the passage of foul, malodorous blood clots and strange substances of five colors in the stool and urine. Or the nine orifices may discharge pus, the stench unbearable—these are the expulsion of fetal toxins and accumulated impurities. Once fully purged, a fragrant aroma fills the room. If the eyes excrete toxins and become difficult to open, use human milk for washing and application. During days of confusion and stupor, with pain in every joint, bones seeming to crumble to powder, and the entire body drenched in sweat, do not be alarmed—this is true liberation. At this time, one is like a dragon shedding its bones, a snake sloughing its skin. Or the whole body may erupt in fire, the pain unbearable, piercing bones and penetrating sinews, with days of stupor lasting three to five days, losing all awareness of the external world. Do not fear; let heaven decide. Simply maintain a dead heart and enter the chamber—naturally, spirit will surge and wisdom arise, and the six supernormal perceptions will be fully attained.

After the six perceptions, the three sections and eight scenes within the body manifest all their spirits, becoming one’s dharma-protecting vajra kings.

**Detailed Explanation of the Perils in the Three Sections and Eight Scenes**
The Primordial Lady of Grand Unity said: After the six supernormal perceptions are fully attained, the three sections and eight scenes within the body—the twenty-four Perfected Ones—all manifest their forms, becoming one’s dharma-protecting vajra kings. The so-called twenty-four Perfected Ones are the six roots entering awareness, the three hun and seven po, each with their own names.

**Upper Section Manifestations:**
- Brain Spirit: Awakened Primordial Child, styled Daodu
- Hair Spirit: Mysterious Literary Florescence, styled Daoheng
- Hearing Spirit: Penetrating Multitude, styled Daolian
- Eye Spirit: Void Mirror Life, styled Daowei
- Tongue Spirit: Originating Beam Peak, styled Daoqi
- Teeth Spirit: Numinous Plan Cover, styled Daozhou
- Mouth Spirit: Covering Calendar Auxiliary, styled Daozhu
- Nose Spirit: Rushing Dragon Jade, styled Daoping

**Middle Section Eight Scenes:**
- Throat Spirit: Hundred Streams Release, styled Daotong
- Lung Spirit: Plain Numinous Life, styled Daogeng
- Heart Spirit: Radiant Yang Prosperity, styled Daoming
- Liver Spirit: Opening Lord Youth, styled Daoqing
- Gallbladder Spirit: Dragon Virtue Constraint, styled Daofang
- Left Kidney Spirit: Spring Primordial Perfected, styled Daoqing
- Right Kidney Spirit: Image Earth Primordial, styled Daosheng
- Spleen Spirit: Treasure Primordial Complete, styled Daoqian

**Lower Section Eight Scenes:**
- Stomach Spirit: Same as Vermilion Nurture, styled Daochen
- Kidney Center Spirit: Auspicious Soaring Health, styled Daohuan
- Large and Small Intestine Spirit: Vast Delivery Retention, styled Daochu
- Diaphragm Spirit: Receiving Offering Abundance, styled Daoling
- Chest Spirit: Vast Heroic Residence, styled Daozhong
- Flank Spirit: Dispelling False Horse, styled Daocheng
- Left Yin Right Yang Spirit: Supporting Retention Rise, styled Daogui
- Right Yin Left Yang Spirit: Enveloping Bright Manifestation, styled Daofu

It is further said: Within the body are the Nine Palace Perfected Ones, which one must not be ignorant of:
- Heart: Perfected One of the Bi Yi Palace
- Kidneys: Perfected One of the Cinnabar Primordial Palace
- Liver: Perfected One of the Orchid Terrace Palace
- Lungs: Perfected One of the Ministerial Palace
- Spleen: Perfected One of the Yellow Court Palace
- Gallbladder: Perfected One of the Heavenly Numinous Palace
- Large Intestine: Perfected One of the Long Numinous Palace
- Small Intestine: Perfected One of the Mysterious Numinous Palace
- Bladder: Perfected One of the Jade Chamber Palace

The Dao is not cumbersome—merely preserve the secret. The true mud-pill palace and every joint have their spirits, too numerous to enumerate. Practitioners of the Dao must proceed with utmost care. At this stage, when all spirits manifest, one must see as if not seeing, hear as if not hearing, and enter samādhi with a dead heart to ensure no loss occurs.

**The Pure Yang Ancestral Qi Aiding the Embryo**
Yin Changsheng said: After the sun and moon conjoin, in the extreme of stillness, one suddenly feels two streams of pure yang substance rising from the Bubbling Spring point, piercing the knees and passing through the thighs, surging upward with boundless vigor.

As for the lower elixir field, when all converges in one place, I then emit the samādhi true fire to refine it. The pure yang substance ascends along the Governing Vessel behind the back, piercing the Jiaji point, passing through the Jade Pillow, and directly penetrating the Mud Pill Palace. Crossing the Magpie Bridge, it descends into the Central Palace, merging with the immortal embryo, intimately embracing to become one. Naturally, the true qi steams and suffuses, harmonizing the entire body, rendering cold and heat unable to invade.

At the time when the sun has yet to rise and the light of Tang Valley is faint, gather the spirit and sit in stillness, emptying the self to await it. Abandon inner thoughts and sever worldly ties; suddenly forget heaven and earth, shatter the bodily form. Naturally, in the great void, a single point of yang light—like dew, like lightning—suddenly enters my Mysterious Pass, pierces the Mud Pill Palace, and transforms into sweet nectar, descending within. I then stir the winnowing wind to respond, driving out the evils of the Three Passes and Nine Orifices, sweeping away the filth of the five viscera and six bowels. The body is refined, dross is smelted, turbidity is expelled, and the impure is transmuted into a purely yang body.

**The Heavenly Mechanism of Grain-Abstention and Samādhi-Stabilization**
Yuanduzi said: Once transformed into pure yang, if the heart clings to worldly flavors and eating does not cease, yang will not be pure, and yin demons may come to disturb. For every portion of food retained, a portion of yin remains. To exhaust yin and purify yang, one must see through worldly flavors, sever worldly ties, and only then can wisdom arise suddenly, and the desire for food vanish. If one can swiftly cease eating, samādhi is attained and exited swiftly; if abstention is slow, attainment and exit are also slow.

Yet for those who enter samādhi through grain-abstention, if thoughts do not cease and the heart is filled with emotions, the fire cools and the elixir chills, the original spirit cannot guard the qi. It then transforms into breath, becoming mingled essence. If the human heart does not cease and desires are not extinguished, one cannot abstain from food, and great samādhi remains unattainable—all prior efforts may be ruined.

Only when the golden liquid has fully descended and the celestial pivot ceases its turning should one add the practice of purifying the belly and dispelling dreams. Until worldly flavors are forever severed, deep sleep vanishes entirely, and both breath and pulse cease, the embryo will be perfected and the spirit complete. The Great Harmony primordial qi fills the center, and hunger is no longer felt. The five aggregates are empty, the six penetrations suddenly attained, and wisdom-light begins to open—foreknowledge arises, yet it must not be recklessly employed. If wisdom is not used, it grows ever brighter; if concealed and misused, external demons are summoned. Like clouds obscuring the sun, the light of wisdom fades, and foreknowledge vanishes—what was once penetrating becomes impenetrable.

**The Heavenly Mechanism of the Five Qi Assembling at the Origin**
Chunyidaoren said: In nurturing the embryo and entering samādhi, the heart must not cling to worldly flavors. Gathering the spirit and deeply returning to quiescence, one can unite nature and life. Naturally, the five viscera are reborn, and the bodily form is reestablished. Without substance, substance is generated, and the sacred embryo is formed.

With the heart as the master of stillness, all conditions cease. External thoughts do not enter, inner thoughts do not arise. All day, one remains in primordial chaos, as if within the womb—this is the living dead. At this time, the yin qi in the heart is nearly exhausted; even if there are joyful worldly matters, the heart does not waver. The true qi of the heart meridian naturally unfolds, transforming into red clouds and mist, ascending to the front of Kunlun.

The yin qi in the liver is nearly exhausted; even if there are enraging matters, the liver does not stir. The true qi of the liver meridian unfolds, transforming into blue-green clouds and mist, ascending to the left of Kunlun.

The yin qi in the spleen is nearly exhausted; even if there are desirable matters, the spleen does not stir. The true qi of the spleen meridian unfolds, transforming into yellow clouds and mist, ascending to the crown of Kunlun.

The yin qi in the lungs is nearly exhausted; even if there are sorrowful matters, the lungs do not stir. The true qi of the lung meridian unfolds, transforming into white clouds and mist, ascending to the right of Kunlun.

The yin qi in the kidneys is nearly exhausted; even if there are fearful matters, the kidneys do not stir. The true qi of the kidney meridian unfolds, transforming into black clouds and mist, ascending to the rear of Kunlun—these are called the Five Qi.

As for "assembling at the origin," one need not employ methods to guide the qi; in extreme stillness, it naturally ascends. One will see blue-green qi emerging from the east, accompanied by the sounds of reed pipes and bells, with banners, chariots, and attendants—countless in number—surrounding it. Soon, red qi emerges from the south, white qi from the west, black qi from the north, and yellow qi from the center. The Five Qi assemble at the Upper Origin, swirling and coalescing—yet one must not observe them. With a dead heart, enter samādhi.

The ancients said: "When spirit resides in the aperture, a thousand wisdoms arise; when the elixir enters the crucible, ten thousand transformations occur." The numinous resonance of my heart and the numinosity of heaven and earth mutually respond—externally true, internally true—merging into oneness. This stage of practice is entirely based on utmost stillness as the foundation, non-movement as the principle.

Laozi said: "If one can always remain clear and still, all under heaven will return to them." Then, in the great void, a wheel of the sun naturally appears, mirroring my elixir-light above and below, merging into one.

**The Heavenly Mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s Upright Qi**
Shangyangzi said: When exerting great effort in a quiet chamber, externally free from sensory attachments and internally free from distracting thoughts, after long and deep practice, following the assembly of the Five Qi at the origin, both breath and pulse become quiescent. Suddenly, one feels the heart-fire descending and the kidney-water ascending; the five viscera generate fluids, and the hundred vessels flow freely. The heart meridian surges upward, the nose detects rare fragrances, the tongue produces sweet saliva, and one ceases to eat, remaining awake day and night.

At night, one can see through walls and perceive past events as well as future fortunes. When true qi arises at night, red mist swirls above the crown, and a radiant orb emerges between the brows.

This marks the initial emergence of the immortal embryo’s medicinal power, with all passages and orifices now opened. At this stage, if one does not abstain from the five grains, the yang qi will be difficult to refine, and pure yang will remain elusive, making illness likely—one remains but an ordinary mortal. The key is to forget both inner and outer, until lead is exhausted and mercury dried.

Within the abdomen, thunderous rumblings and lightning-like surges arise, winds and clouds discharging freely. Appetite fluctuates, turbid fluids flow unceasingly from the nose, and foul odors issue from the mouth, with vomit resembling yellow sand. Whether pleasant or not, the refined grains ascend and descend like pellets, later excreted as a bean-soup-like discharge, its stench unbearable. Following this, a buttery, oily substance is expelled, and rare fragrances waft from the nose, perceptible to all. Then, in both bowel movements and urine, five-colored substances appear like cinnabar beads—this is the sign of having stolen the upright qi of heaven, earth, and the myriad things.

If one does not guard this state with utmost care and enter profound stillness, the primordial spirit may depart its abode, and true qi will escape. With the cinnabar terrace left unattended, the heart grows lax, the Three Corpses arise in unison, and the Six Thieves converge, disturbing the sovereign heart. Doubts arise during meditation, fear and unease take hold, sleep is plagued by startling dreams, and malevolent visions proliferate endlessly. Without vigilance and self-reflection, forcing oneself into stillness only causes the heart to stir and the spirit to wander. The body sits while the elixir flees, and all prior efforts are undone.

**Manifestations of the Three Treasures’ Celestial Mechanism**
Niyuan Cuixu Lady said: After the union of sun and moon, within the upper, middle, and lower cinnabar fields, three lotus pedestals appear. Upon each pedestal sits a child with crossed legs—these are the transformative marvels of the golden elixir, illusory visions that must not be clung to. Swiftly enter profound stillness, advancing to the utmost extinction of thought. A golden lotus then emerges from the Yellow Court, piercing the crown and ascending straight into the heavens. It scatters golden blossoms, which bloom to their fullest before wilting and descending in profusion. At once, gather the spirit and enter stillness, using intent to retain them. These golden flowers nourish the immortal embryo within, nurturing the immortal infant.

**The Red Serpent Penetrating the Passes’ Celestial Mechanism**
Zhuang Zhou said: The red serpent penetrating the passes is the transformation of the golden liquid returning elixir, arising from the union of sun and moon. With the heart-sovereign in great stillness, the elixir’s radiance transforms into a red child. At its first appearance, it takes the form of a cinnabar serpent, its light illuminating all before it, suddenly breaking through the void to approach. The golden liquid fills the crown, a surging silver tide of golden nectar, from which a red serpent emerges, entering through the crown gate. Its mouth emits auspicious light, roaring like a torch, darting through the entire body, racing through the joints without obstruction. One must enter a state of utter stillness, allowing it free rein—soon, it vanishes.

If startled, the red child cannot ascend to the mud-pill palace, and one remains trapped in the dim thoroughfare. Should the cinnabar serpent fly toward you, remain unafraid, and you may converse with divine beings. Within this great stillness, a vermilion bird may lead the way, and gods, ghosts, immortals, and buddhas may all address you—yet you must not engage with them. In short: all seen by the eyes and heard by the ears is illusory; none of it is real. Whether dragons and tigers battle, infant and maiden unite, tortoise and serpent entwine, or immortals and buddhas come to pay homage—all are phantasms, not to be taken as true. To heed them is to stir the heart and scatter the spirit, ruining one’s cultivation. Only by concentrating the spirit, stabilizing the qi, and returning to great stillness can one transcend and enter the realm of immortality.

**The Red Serpent Returning to the Body’s Celestial Mechanism**
Chen Xubai said: When the red serpent penetrates the passes, know that this is the celestial sun, drawn by the elixir’s radiance to return to the body and nurture the immortal embryo. Its descent varies in speed—do not be alarmed. Once it enters the body, it transforms into countless fiery arrows, piercing the entire frame. Remain utterly still and composed until it vanishes of its own accord. Naturally, every orifice will emit a fine radiance, and with the heart dead, the Dao is achieved.

**The Thunder God Overseeing the Altar’s Celestial Mechanism**
Baigu Zhenren said: After the union of sun and moon, the elixir’s radiance overflows from the central palace, streaming and scattering brilliance. From behind the spine, it pierces the crown gate, its auspicious light as large as a cartwheel, its splendor dazzling the eyes, guarding the meditative seat and illuminating it day and night. If the thunder god oversees the altar, it is because the human heart has been refined to death, the Dao-heart cultivated to purity, the nature’s essence stilled and perfectly luminous, and the consciousness-spirit at ease without reliance. It transforms into a thunder god to intimidate, threatening one’s cultivation. Yet remain utterly still and composed, returning to great stillness, and the consciousness-spirit will naturally transform into a dharma-protecting vajra king.

**The Perils of Fire Engulfing the Meditative Seat**
Yin Dazhenren said: In nurturing the embryo, the dead heart is paramount, and profound stillness is the foundation. When the embryo is complete, if the heart stirs and the spirit wavers, it arouses the true fire of samadhi in the cinnabar field. Flames issue from the seven orifices, and the entire body blazes with fire. If not swiftly restrained, in an instant, the meditative seat may be consumed by fire. The method is to swiftly employ true intent and the gaze of the eyes, visualizing a mass of black qi the size of a cartwheel in the empty space before you, cold as ice and chilling to the touch. Focus on this scene, then use true intent to draw it into the abdomen. Remain utterly still, entering the extinction of all thought. In a moment, the heavens will clear, and you may return to great stillness, extinguishing the vision. Whether three or five times, continue until the perverse fire is fully dispelled—only then will the danger of self-immolation be averted.

**The Celestial Mechanism of Battling Inner and Outer Yin Demons**
Huangfang Gong said: When nurturing the embryo in stillness, illusions may arise—heavenly palaces of jade and towers of paradise, hellish visions of grotesque forms, heads of gods and faces of demons, some real, some illusory, growing ever more bizarre.

No matter how they transform a thousand or ten thousand ways, remain utterly resolute—when inner and outer yin demons and all spectral illusions arise to disturb you, they cannot be dispelled. The method lies in seeing as if not seeing, hearing as if not hearing, guarding the heart within, and concentrating the spirit with single-minded focus. Silently recite the Golden Light Divine Mantra, and the demons will retreat of themselves. If the visions or sounds persist, swiftly refine the fire to incinerate the body, and the demonic obstructions will scatter.

The method of incineration: focus the mind and visualize the sun in empty space, drawn forth by the radiance of your elixir. Within the cinnabar field, another mass of true fire surges upward, bursting through the crown of the head. Let the two fires merge their light—roaring and blazing, filling heaven and earth with flames—until all things are consumed in the conflagration. Only when the smoke dissipates and the fire subsides, the sky clears and the qi settles, will all demonic obstructions dissolve into nothingness.

**The Celestial Mechanism of Spring Tides Rising**
Hunranzi said: When nurturing the embryo in stillness and abiding in luminous awareness for a long time, you may suddenly feel the cinnabar field like a spring tide rising. At once, guard the natural inner breath and the effortless spirit-fire, refining and tempering it. The water will naturally transform into warm qi, flowing from the inner sides of both thighs down to the *yongquan* points. You must direct the spirit to the heels, letting the true breath descend through the soles of the feet. After a short while, when the *yongquan* points become settled and still, turn your intent to reflect upon the *weilu*, silently guarding the rear. Suddenly, you may feel something surging upward from the *weilu*—soft as cotton, smooth as a path, or like a mass of qi, sluggish and difficult to move. With single-minded focus, refine it fiercely, and a wave of hot qi will break through the *weilu*, ascend the spine, and pour into the *niwan* palace. There, you will hear the sound of rushing water, ceaseless and roaring. After a long time, the sound will naturally cease.

Abide in this state, holding fast for a while. Press the tongue against the upper palate and seal the three barriers tightly. When stillness deepens, the golden liquid will fill the mouth, flow down the windpipe, descend the *chonglou*, and cool the heart-ground. Detached from all circumstances, enter great stillness. Should joy, anger, sorrow, or fear arise, do not let the heart waver or the spirit falter—remain resolute in stillness, never emerging from quiescence. Guard the radiance of inherent nature, and when the true embryo is complete, the yang spirit will manifest. Mountains and rivers of the great earth will lie as if in the palm of your hand.

If the spirit and qi fail to unite as one, the qi will linger in the body while the spirit wanders outside, becoming a yin spirit destined for rebirth or possession—no longer able to return as a true spirit. When the sacred embryo is nearly complete, the physical body must not emerge from stillness. Once the sacred embryo is fully formed, the dharma-body must not linger long within the shell; to fail to emerge is to miss the moment of spirit-transformation, and you will remain but an ordinary mortal. Only when spirit and qi unite as one can the peril of separation be averted.

**Heavenly Flowers Cascading: The Oral Secret of Ceasing Fire**

The Yellow Emperor said: After the embryo is complete and the utmost quiescence of extinction is attained, the radiance of inherent nature emerges. In stillness, gazing outward, one sees purple auroras and auspicious mists filling the eyes; looking downward from the crown, a golden light envelops the body—do not cling to it. With the heart stilled and settled in samādhi, golden lotuses rise from the earth, and white snowflakes drift across the sky. The golden lotuses surge from the ground, piercing the nine heavens, naturally transforming into snowflakes that descend from the sky in profusion. With intention, gather them back into the body to nurture the immortal infant—this is the moment of ceasing fire after ten months of embryo cultivation.

If, when heavenly flowers cascade, one fails to cease fire, the infant risks being consumed by fire in dhyāna. The cascading of heavenly flowers marks the transition from the central palace of samādhi to the upper field. Fire must be ceased to transform the spirit; no further practice of quiescent illumination is needed. Simply abide in the emptiness of the heart, returning to the void, and the fire will naturally subside.

There is entering and exiting samādhi: exiting means moving from the central field to the upper field; entering means concentrating the spirit in the celestial valley of the mud-pill palace, reopening the ears and eyes, and restoring clarity. The moment of exiting samādhi must coincide with the day of ceasing fire. If one exits before ceasing fire, the spirit will wander and drift far away; if one exits after applying fire, the spirit will grow dull and unresponsive.

**Transcending the Perils of the Upper Field**

The Old Man of the Southern Pole said: When the sacred embryo first emerges, it ascends from the central palace to the upper field. The upper field is the inner court of the celestial palace. Without the sovereign of true awakening, one may unwittingly encounter the five colors, five sounds, mirages of celestial towers, and all manner of marvels within the cosmos—all rushing forth in sudden profusion. Amidst the splendor of the inner court, all phenomena—deities, buddhas, and immortals—must not be engaged, not even in a single word. With countless illusions assailing the senses, if the true person falters, they will surely sink into stupor and perish. Once the true person dies, all prior efforts are undone. How lamentable!

Only with a heart stilled and nature settled, the heart unmoved by death, treating all phenomena as unheard and unseen, can the true person remain unharmed. In ancient times, Patriarch Liu, the Flower-Adorning True Person, when his spirit ascended to the inner court, became entangled in its splendor and could not escape the bewildering labyrinth to reach the other shore—hence the practice of refining nature in the Flowery Street. From the returning elixir to this stage of the great celestial cycle, whether real or illusory, all must be disregarded. Only by stilling the heart and entering samādhi can one ensure absolute safety.

**The Oral Secret of the Yang Spirit Passing Through the Towering Chambers**

Master Guangcheng said: When the yang spirit moves from the central palace to the upper field, it must pass through the twelve towering chambers. This barrier is truly formidable. One must sit in silent composure, neither knowing nor unknowing, neither exerting force nor refraining from it. Simply maintain the thought of a single breath spanning a thousand miles, and a thousand miles compressed into a single breath—this is the subtle art of swiftly passing through the towering chambers. At this stage, the work is as fine as a thread, and the spirit is difficult to transmit; one must realize it for oneself.

When the true person passes through the towering chambers to ascend to the inner garden, at the moment when the celestial gate is about to open, if the heart grows drowsy, the yang spirit will vanish and drift away. Only by remaining spiritually alert in the midst of stillness, with a firm grasp within the obscurity, can one move the yang spirit from the central field and abide in quiescent illumination within the mud-pill palace of the upper field. Swiftly guide it into the extinction of all thought, settling it in quiescent extinction. Concentrate the spirit in the mud-pill palace without fixating on the upper field, allowing the yang spirit to illumine the upper field in stillness. Envision the three fields merging into a single vast expanse of emptiness—boundless, without inside or outside, hollow and luminous. After the yang spirit ascends to the fontanel, one must never look downward, lest the spirit be startled, cling to the shell, and dare not emerge—this is the first layer of the physical body.

If the vast expanse of emptiness is not shattered, one cannot escape the bewildering labyrinth. Only when the inner true and outer responsive fires converge in radiance will the celestial gate open of itself.

**The Oral Secret of Regulating the Spirit and Exiting the Shell**

Master Liu Qiaoyang said: When the yang spirit moves from the central field to the upper field and merges in quiescent samādhi, at the moment of utmost stillness, suddenly a thunderous crack resounds, and the crown gate bursts open. One must then close the eyes, still the heart, and concentrate the spirit in samādhi within the celestial valley of the inner court. The body feels as though suspended in emptiness, the spirit and qi drifting freely, luminous and unobscured, carefree and at ease. The five senses and hundred bones of the physical body vanish from perception, and the burdens of the mundane world are forgotten—only the true self remains within the vast expanse of emptiness.

At this moment, the five qi naturally coalesce into colored clouds, shielding the dharma-body. Now begins the practice of regulating the spirit to exit the shell. One may see chaotic music and joyous abundance, golden youths and jade maidens flanking and protecting, or ride a fiery dragon or fierce tiger, ascending from below. Along the way, pavilions and temples, human emperors, and all manner of demonic realms may appear—do not cling to them. One must see as though not seeing, hear as though not hearing. No one surpasses me in greatness. Simply continue ascending, with officials, musicians, and attendants following on all sides. If one lingers in attachment, though they may seem reluctant to part, they will ultimately hinder passage.

Thus, one ascends and descends repeatedly, countless times, until the practice becomes thoroughly ingrained. With a single ascent, one reaches the celestial palace; with a single descent, one returns to the original place. Moving up and down, there is no obstruction. Ascending from below is like climbing a seven-tiered pagoda or the twelve jeweled towers—one level after another. When thunder rumbles, lightning flashes, and red light suffuses the realm.

As purple flames suffuse the sky and twin fires converge in radiance, a single thunderous crash resounds—then the crown gate swings wide open. With a single thought, the mind emerges beyond the Celestial Gate, transcending the mortal frame. And lo, a body exists beyond the body.

**Oral Instructions for Opening the Celestial Gate**
Wei Boyang said: When the yang spirit ascends to the crown gate, observe inwardly in stillness. Within the crown, there is the true fire of samadhi; outwardly, in stillness, behold the solar divine radiance above the crown. One must employ true intent to silently illuminate and condense it, causing the upper fire to shoot downward and the lower fire to blaze upward. With inner and outer forces converging in attack, refining and tempering ensue. At the Baihui point atop the head, it is like a pool of silver waves; the crown brims with golden needles. As the twin fires clash, thunder roars ceaselessly, blasting open the inner courtyard of the Purple Palace. In an instant, red light pervades the realm, and purple flames fill the sky. A swift thunderbolt splits the chamber with a resounding crash—the crown gate opens. It is like the birth of an infant: breath moves, yet the fontanel remains unclosed, as wide as a coin, as thin as silk. The skull seems to shatter, the cranial bones melt away. When the crown gate first opens, the brain feels cleaved by a great axe, the pain unbearable. Yet one must not be startled—after three days of agony, natural healing will follow.

**Oral Instructions for Gathering the Golden Light at the Celestial Gate**
Master Cihang said: Once the spirit has ascended above the crown gate, the crown gate becomes like the Celestial Gate, and the brain palace is the Celestial Palace. Do not be afraid; simply set the mind at ease, focus the will, and contemplate the Dharma-body. With a single thought, the mind emerges beyond the Celestial Gate. Then, closing the eyes, leap gently downward as if awakening from a dream—and a body exists beyond the body. When the yang spirit first emerges, it lingers three or four feet beside the physical form. One must not allow the mind to engage with anything seen or heard outside. Whether it be parents, kin, ancestors, spouse, or children—even if sages and buddhas come to pay homage, celestial decrees descend, or the Queen Mother issues an invitation—whether real or illusory, all phenomena must be cast beyond consideration. Recognize nothing, cling to nothing, and under no circumstances attach to them. Remain utterly still, free from thought and emotion, abiding in samadhi without seeing or hearing, waiting in stillness. In an instant, a golden or white light, vast as a chariot wheel, will manifest before you. Direct true intent to move the Dharma-body before the light and condense it there. Once true intent is fixed, imagine the golden light gradually contracting until it shrinks to the size of a coin. Then, with a single inhalation of intent, draw this light into the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body then enters the cinnabar frame and the Sea of Nature, returning to its original palace. Abide in the extinction samadhi, entering profound stillness. As the ancients said: "The golden light is the wondrous elixir of transformation—do not miss it. If it scatters, it cannot be gathered again." Thus arises the doctrine of retaining form, unable to transform into formlessness.

**Oral Instructions for Gathering Golden Light and Deploying the Five Sprouts of Spirit-Qi**
The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: When the yang spirit first emerges from the mortal body, its form is but three inches tall. Whether it circles left or right, or turns to sit in meditation, immediately draw it back into the upper field’s spirit-chamber for silent nurturing. After eighty-one repetitions, the five sprouts of spirit-qi are deployed throughout the body. These five sprouts of qi arise after extreme stillness, when the five qi converge at the origin. They illuminate the void, transforming into five-colored auspicious clouds. Then, using the radiance of one’s original nature and moving true intent, project it into the auspicious clouds, transmuting them into a mass of golden light as vast as a chariot wheel. The yang spirit sits serenely within this golden light, while the residual qi of the elixir-light transforms into external demons and heterodox visions, conjuring a hundred illusions to tempt the spirit. If one is even slightly swayed by sounds or sights, the yang spirit will depart and not return, entering demonic realms and cycling through the Six Paths of rebirth. The world may mistake this for the minor attainment of "sitting transformation," but it is not. All prior efforts are then wasted—truly lamentable. This arises from insufficient refinement of the self and the failure to truly "die" in the heart. One must single-mindedly guard the golden light, remaining utterly still. All demonic realms will then retreat of their own accord. When the golden light contracts, use true intent to focus and inhale it, drawing the Dharma-body back into the original palace of the Sea of Nature. Merge them into one, abiding in stillness. After a long time, when the spirit emerges again, these yin demons will have transformed into true spirits, appearing before you identical to the physical body—only then is safety assured.

**Oral Instructions for Regulating the Yang Spirit’s Entry and Exit**
Shao Kangjie said: When the yang spirit emerges, if its ascent and descent are well-practiced, one must choose an auspicious day on the yellow path, when the sky is clear and the qi serene, to harmonize the spirit and exit the shell. Guard it as one would a newborn child: avoid venturing out in heavy fog or rain, and tend to it ceaselessly. Do not slacken for even a moment, lest the yang spirit depart and not return, entering the cycle of rebirth and wasting all prior efforts.

**Oral Instructions for the Yang Spirit’s Entry and Exit**
Ancestor Chen Tixu said: If the yang spirit departs and does not return, it is due to insufficient refinement of the self. When the yang spirit moves outward, one must single-mindedly guard the golden aperture, remaining utterly still—then the demons will retreat of their own accord. The yang spirit must not be lightly sent out or carelessly released; it should depart swiftly and return swiftly. One may also fear seeing one’s own physical form as a pile of filth, causing the yang spirit to refuse re-entry. It must exit and enter by the same path, never looking back, lest the yang spirit see and grow fearful. As the saying goes: "Turn back and fail to recognize the corpse." All must be practiced to perfection.

**Oral Instructions for the Yang Spirit’s Entry and Exit (Continued)**

When the yang spirit emerges, take but a single step before swiftly returning to its original palace. Once the nine-by-nine cycle is complete, then practice two steps before returning to the palace. Proceed thus up to the nine-by-nine cycle, following the same principle thereafter. After three years of refinement, first journey to the West, then to the East, South, and North. Train above and below for another three years, ensuring complete detachment from surroundings, unshaken by external phenomena—mastery over expansion and contraction, coming and going at will. Upon re-entering the Mud Pill Palace, the physical body grows fiery hot, and golden light radiates from every pore.

Should one encounter something fearful, terror arises; should one encounter desire, attachment follows—lingering and wandering, one falls into demonic paths and fails to attain the true fruit. The essence lies in entering samādhi with utter stillness, remaining unmoved by joy, fear, sorrow, or delight. This is the principle of the ten-month gestation and the three-year nurturing of the infant spirit.

In stillness, yang stirs as gold departs the ore; beneath the earth, thunder roars as fire compels the metal. The four seasons’ firing times—yang’s literary and yin’s martial aspects—must not be lost; advance and retreat, withdrawal and addition, all require control.

The three-year nurturing is the third stage of refining spirit to return to emptiness, known as the completion of the nurturing phase. Laozi said: "Nurturing" refers to the process of training and cultivation. When the yang spirit first emerges, its sacred form is still tender; to condense its radiant wisdom and prevent dissipation, it must be nurtured until it becomes firm, mature, and boundlessly powerful—then it may achieve miraculous transformations. For nurturing is the practice of refining spirit through samādhi.

When the yang spirit first emerges from samādhi, it is easily disturbed; only through prolonged nurturing in samādhi can it become steadfast and cease reckless movement. Thus, through repeated samādhi, it aligns with the natural void; through repeated nurturing, it cultivates the sacred form of true emptiness.

Bai Yuchan said: Practicing the three-year nurturing and the forty-nine-day method of preservation requires refining spirit to return to emptiness and condensing spirit into samādhi. Initially, when refining the spirit to exit the shell, it should emerge and re-enter in quick succession. Rely on the *nirodha-samāpatti* to extinguish it. After seven days in samādhi, refine it to emerge and re-enter again, still relying on *nirodha-samāpatti* to extinguish it. After fourteen days, refine it to emerge and re-enter once more. After twenty-one days, refine it to emerge and begin re-entering. After twenty-eight days, proceed thus through thirty-five, forty-two, and forty-nine days, refining it to emerge and re-enter. Gradually nurture it for three years, always aligning the yang spirit’s expansion and contraction with the timing of its emergence and return.

When the spirit resides in the upper field, at the culmination of *nirodha-samāpatti*, first emanate yang light through the crown gate. Then, with a single thought of emergence, follow the light to transcend the body. When joyfully gathering the spirit back into the shell, first withdraw the radiant light into the mechanism of the dharmakāya, then let the yang spirit return by the original path to the center of the physical body. Again, rely on *nirodha-samāpatti* to extinguish it. Refining emergence and return, extinguishing through *nirodha-samāpatti*—after three years, the nature-body matures, and one is safeguarded against all fears and perils.

Peng Helin said: The earlier mention of "seven days in samādhi" does not mean absolute stillness for seven or forty-nine days. Even if yang light emerges, one should immediately guide it back into the dharmakāya with intention, relying on *nirodha-samāpatti* to extinguish it without annihilation. Only at the appointed time of emergence should one first emanate yang light outside the body, then let the yang spirit follow the light to exit through the crown gate—never lingering long outside. The depth of nurturing must be observed; only after three years of nurturing can one be free from the peril of losing the way.

Bodhidharma said: When refining the yang spirit’s emergence and return, if wind blows, it may scatter; if sunlight shines, it may wither. Whether inside or outside, it is safest to avoid exposure to wind and sun. After three months of refinement, awareness gradually awakens—beware of startling disturbances. Whether emerging or returning, adhere to the regular schedule; control expansion and contraction, never acting arbitrarily. Thus, in the first three months, the spirit emerges three times a day, never at night. After half a year, it emerges five times a day; after a year, seven times a day, moving only near the body. After two years, unrestricted by day or night, frequency, or proximity, it may briefly depart the physical form. After three years, it may travel a *li*, ten *li*, a hundred *li*, a thousand *li*, or ten thousand *li* in an instant.

The Eastern Flower Emperor said: At the beginning of refining the spirit, during the first, second, and third seven-day periods, take one, two, or three steps before returning; or during the fifth, sixth, or seventh seven-day periods, venture one, two, or three *li* before returning. After one, two, or three years, venture a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand *li* before returning. After three years of nurturing, do not linger long outside—then enter samādhi for nine more years.

It is also said: When refining the spirit’s emergence and return, wait for clear skies, calm air, and the absence of wind, clouds, thunder, or lightning before practicing the spirit’s exit from the shell. After three years, the nature-body matures, taking the great void as its dwelling, the heavens and earth as its bed and pillow. A single step spans a thousand *li*; one may wander myriad lands, emerging from nothingness and entering existence, traversing heaven and earth. One may pass through metal and stone without obstruction, multiply forms and disperse shadows, manifesting a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million bodies across the three thousand great-thousand worlds—thus is the nurturing accomplished. This is called a *xian*.

In summary, the three-year nurturing means refining the yang spirit’s emergence and return until it is practiced to perfection, the sacred form matured—spending more time within than without.

After the three-year achievement is complete, one must undertake the nine-year *Great Stabilization* to return to emptiness, facing the wall to perfect attainment—this is called *Dairou Jinxian* (Replacing Flesh with Golden Immortality). The practice of returning to emptiness and facing the wall refines emptiness to merge with the Dao, a nine-year endeavor. This is termed *perfecting attainment through facing the wall*.

Master Lü states: The marvel of refining emptiness lies in forgetting form. Within the chaos of no-self and no-other, a single point of true *qi* remains—body hot as fire, heart cold as ice, *qi* flowing like a spring, spirit still as a prison. Emptying body and mind, relinquishing all activity, one listens to the Dao’s natural movement. Whether self or not-self, emptiness or not-emptiness, the workings of creation revolve. When one attains the state of forgetting form, the yang spirit unites with the great void—this is called *refining the heart*. The yang spirit has no form, hence it is called *refining emptiness*. Through nine years of this practice, the wonders of refining emptiness become boundless. One may tread upon rosy clouds, shatter the void, and soar away in full bodily flight—this is called *Daluo Jinxian* (Golden Immortal of the Great Net). Yet this attainment is most difficult; among ten thousand, scarcely one or two succeed.

Laozi the Supreme Lord says: The practice of returning to emptiness involves gathering the yang spirit—previously tempered through a thousand trials and a hundred refinements, capable of multiplying forms, dispersing shadows, and traversing heaven and earth—back into the original vessel, withdrawing it into the sea of nature, the inner courtyard of the celestial valley. The physical body is refined and merged into the Dharma-body. This is the union of nature and life, returning the yang spirit to the sea of nature, retreating it into the primordial cavity of the great void’s boundlessness. The physical body must be smelted and forged until it attains the state of neither being nor non-being, neither form nor emptiness, without inside or outside, neither emerging nor entering, without beginning or end—like a dragon nurturing its pearl, silently guarding without movement; like a crane brooding its egg, peacefully resting without stirring. Sinking ever deeper, stilling ever more profoundly, all previous cultivation and realizations—hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, or a hundred million transformed bodies, riding dragons and cranes, treading the sun and moon, myriad transformations—are gathered into the realm of no-birth and extinguished through the *cessation-extinction samādhi*. One must undergo a great death, vigilantly guarding to prevent the yang spirit from re-emerging. For the more the yang spirit is refined, the more numinous it becomes; the more it is tempered, the more still it grows. Refining it again and again without cease, the yang spirit’s wisdom-light and divine fire are drawn in ever more tightly, so that when released, their radiance is all the more vast. When it can be hidden no further, it shines forth beyond all concealment. The yang spirit, concealed within the primordial cavity, after the extreme of cessation-extinction, may remain for a hundred days or ten months, until a crucible of divine light arises, billowing and surging, the true fire within the cauldron blazing fiercely. It emerges from the inner cavities to the outer, penetrating from the great apertures into the small. Without inside or outside, without large or small, it pierces through the crown and reaches the depths, light illuminating light, apertures reflecting one another. People and things alike are all bathed in this divine radiance. This is so, yet it is not the ultimate.

Wang Shaoyang says: If it does not fill the space between heaven and earth, it has not yet reached the measure of the Sage of East Lu, who matches heaven and earth in stature. One must further refine the spirit, concealing its brilliance and withdrawing it into the golden crucible of the yellow court, the primordial cavity between heart and kidneys. Free from defilement, one again abides in the *cessation-extinction samādhi*. As extinction deepens, lasting a year or three, form and spirit gradually merge, form and emptiness return to true constancy. When the balance of emptiness-stabilization reaches its extreme and all is extinguished without remainder, the divine light begins to emerge anew, like clouds, lightning, mist, and rosy dawn, surging forth from the boundless cavity of the great void. It pours through the upper and lower apertures, the great and small, filling every cavity with divine light. The radiance is all-pervading, illuminating the ten directions, reaching upward to the celestial realms, downward to the earthly realms, and through the human realm. Within the three realms, the divine light is felt to fill every place, like mirrors reflecting one another, like imperial pearls merging their brilliance. Layer upon layer, light interweaves, each manifestation clearly revealed. Spirits and ghosts alike are bathed in this divine radiance. Wondrous indeed, yet still not the ultimate.

Master Jiwu says: If it does not pervade the dust-mote dharma-realms, it has not yet reached the measure of the Western Sage, Vairocana Buddha. One must again gather the spirit’s radiance, withdrawing it into the secret and mysterious cavity, unstained by even a speck of dust, and abide in the *cessation-extinction samādhi*. As extinction deepens over months and years, reaching the extreme of emptiness-stabilization where all is extinguished without remainder, the divine light becomes full, the Dharma-form complete. Form and emptiness are both transcended, form and spirit both perfected. In its gathering, it is utterly refined and penetrating, entering a mustard seed without obstruction. In its release, it is utterly vast and firm, encompassing Mount Sumeru without limit. Then the boundless divine light transforms into the red radiance of the sun, like a blazing solar orb surging forth from the boundless cavity of the great void. Bursting open and scattering, it blazes in splendor, boundless and immeasurable, its myriad rays dazzling the eye. It pierces through the nine heavens above and penetrates the nine earths below, like ten thousand suns radiating great light, universally illuminating the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds. Sages and worthies, immortals and buddhas, and all the myriad phenomena appear within this solar red light. Yet even this utmost brilliance has not exhausted its wonder.

Master Shangyang observes: If it does not illuminate the four great continents and the thirty-six heavens above, it has not yet fulfilled the measure of the Dao’s workings in the vastness of space.

Once more, gather the spirit and conceal its radiance, abiding in the *samādhi* of extinction to enter quiescent cessation. For a hundred years, a thousand years, one *kalpa*, ten thousand *kalpas*—until the very void crumbles—you merge with the Dao and attain truth. Then, once again, boundless treasure-light is released, filling the Four Great Continents entirely, allowing reunion with the worthy sages, the many immortals, and the buddhas. From time without beginning, you have been parted; only now do you meet face to face. Their light intermingles with yours, fusing into one body, vast and without limit.

A hymn says:
The many immortals and buddhas resemble a great round mirror,
My body is like a *maṇi* dark pearl.
The dharma-body of the immortals and buddhas enters my form,
My body ever enters the bodies of the immortals and buddhas.

This nine-year wall-facing practice returns one to the station of the Great Awakened Golden Immortal of *nirvāṇa* without remainder. When the work is complete and perfect, a celestial decree descends, the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and you ascend to the Golden Portal to receive a true edict and be invested with celestial rank—this is what is called a Heavenly Immortal.

Zhiyi Zi quotes a poem by another adept:
I have perused ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts,
Yet the final step is one no one transmits.

Alas! Refining emptiness to merge with the Dao—
The work of wall-facing is rarely encountered.

In sum: The ultimate return to emptiness is to concentrate spirit in the *qi*-cavern. It is nothing more than utterly forgetting mundane passions. At this final stage of returning to emptiness and entering *samādhi*, it is merely the forgetting of immortal passions—abiding in the *samādhi* of extinction to enter quiescent cessation. Neither emerging nor entering, forgetting both self and others, the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds, the great earth and mountains and rivers, all dissolve into emptiness. The heart dies and returns to the Great Stillness. Whether for a hundred days, ten months, three years, nine years, a hundred years, a thousand years, a thousand *kalpas*, or ten thousand *kalpas*—until the Four Great Elements scatter and the void itself shatters into dust—you become formless and traceless. This is the Great Awakened Golden Immortal of the flesh, a diamond body imperishable through ten thousand *kalpas*. This is recorded here, and there shall be no further esoteric instructions.

Master Huayang says:
I observe that the immortals of the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties all transcended through this very method. Later learners—whether buddha-seeds or immortal-kind—who encounter this book and peruse it carefully several times will grasp the secret and penetrate the aperture, thereby aspiring to become immortals or buddhas. There is no need to scale mountains or ford streams in search of a master or the Dao. With wealth and companions, and with sincere cultivation, one can transcend the mundane and enter the sacred.

The ancients said: Though there be three thousand six hundred side doors and ninety-six kinds of heterodox paths, all ultimately return to the Supreme One—preserving principle, nurturing *qi*, fulfilling nature, and perfecting destiny. The Great Dao is not divided. Though there be ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics, all conceal their heads and reveal their tails. This volume’s twenty-four true secrets and thirty-six perilous stages are transmitted mouth to mouth, heart to heart, each phrase verifiable. Study this book carefully, and none shall fail to succeed.

From ancient times until now, the celestial mechanisms of the immortals, buddhas, and perfected ones have been concealed and never revealed. Now, they are fully disclosed in this book. The annotations point directly to the essentials in a single volume. Though the words may seem simple, their principles are profoundly true. The celestial mechanisms and oral instructions are stated clearly in every line. Do not slight this heavenly treasure. Be cautious, be cautious, lest you incur celestial punishment. To recklessly transmit it to the unworthy invites thunderous execution and fiery immolation. Can one not be cautious?

Shut the door and cultivate in seclusion, reckoning not the years.
Write books and establish teachings to expound the true meaning.
Split the tally to reveal secrets that connect heaven and earth,
Draw from the ancient and weigh the present to harmonize with the sages.
Cleave open primordial chaos to seek the wondrous,
Break through the Supreme Ultimate to perceive the mysterious.
Wait until merit is complete and conduct perfected,
Then leave behind a fragrant name for ten thousand ages.

Before chaos was born, chaos was whole.
The various signs and secrets cannot be transmitted.
Split open the aperture within the aperture,
Tread beyond the heaven within heaven.
Only when the Dipper’s handle revolves in reverse does form appear,
Only when the terrace’s light returns does one become an immortal.
One morning, scooping up the sun from the heart of the deep,
You see through the barbarian monk’s wall-facing Chan.

Shatter the void to dissolve ten thousand *kalpas*,
Once you have reached the other shore, abandon the alchemical oar.
I have perused ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts,
Yet the final phrase is one no one speaks.

Guangcheng Zi said to the Yellow Emperor:
The utmost yin is solemn and still,
The utmost yang is blazing and bright.
The blazing brightness issues from the earth,
The solemn stillness emerges from heaven.
I guide you to ascend above the great brightness,
To the source of utmost yang.
I lead you to enter the gate of profound darkness,
To the source of utmost yin.

**Secret of Sleeping Practice**

The instruction says: Lie with your head to the east, your body curled on its side, like a dog’s coil or a dragon’s spiral. One hand bends to pillow your head, while the other stretches to stroke your navel and abdomen. One leg extends, the other draws in. Gather your spirit and store it in the cinnabar field, where it merges with *qi*. Water and fire intermingle in gentle harmony, so the spirit does not stray outward, and *qi* naturally settles. Before sleep, the heart must sleep first. Let the eyes attain utmost emptiness, abide in profound stillness, and spirit and *qi* will naturally return to their root. Breathing naturally nurtures purity. Without regulating the breath, the breath regulates itself. Without subduing *qi*, *qi* subdues itself.

Chen Xiyi left his form on Mount Hua, Jiang Qingxia shed her body on Wangwu—this is the essence of the sleeping method. It is not a technique of guiding and leading, but the work of establishing the ultimate through stillness. Upon awakening, slowly turn and stretch. At this moment, before a single thought arises, the heart resembles empty space. If you can release and enter profound stillness, the effects are beyond description.

There is also the ancient *yanxi* method. At dusk, let the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, the mouth speak nothing, the heart bear no burdens, the breath be unlabored, the body unmoving. That single point of original spirit and true *qi* cling together like a spark in a furnace. With long practice, it becomes pure and familiar, and the spirit naturally fills without thought of sleep. The so-called sleep demon will not know whence it has gone.

Chen Xiyi’s thirty-two-character sleep instruction is called the *Zhelong* method. It goes:

The dragon returns to the primordial sea,
Yang hides within yin.

People call it the hibernating dragon, yet I hibernate the heart. Concealing its function in silence, the breath sinks deep and deep—sleeping alone as clouds drift at dusk, unknown to the world. The *Zhelong* Secret Formula states:

The Dao lies in guarding the original mandate.
Warm the outer kidneys, turn the light inward to gaze, and settle the spirit in the cinnabar field. First, lie on the left side, the left hand supporting the ribs, the right hand gripping the outer kidneys tightly, the left leg fully bent, the right leg half-bent and half-stretched. Concentrate the spirit in the lower field, silently counting the breaths in and out—three hundred and sixty cycles. Heart and breath depend on each other, neither straying outward, continuous and unbroken, neither clinging nor separating. Then lie flat on the back, both hands gripping the outer kidneys tightly, exerting force forward twelve times. Stretch both legs forward with effort. Hold the breath, lift the body, the jade pillow and heel roots pressing into the bed, palms against the mattress—one breath, one lift, three lifts in succession, then rest in emptiness.

Next, turn to the right side and repeat the previous movements for one full cycle. Return to lying flat on the back, both hands tightly embracing the outer kidneys, performing the exercise as before, exerting force twelve times. Hold the breath and lift the body three times, then rest in emptiness. Then lie on the side, hands tightly embracing the scrotum, the hibernating spirit sinking into the lower field—now present, now absent, utterly unburdened. Stand firm in stillness, first preserving, then dissolving, entering the primordial chaos. This is Chen Xiyi’s *Zhelong* method.

Upon waking from peaceful sleep, when a single yang stirs, proceed with the work of refining the medicine—the oral instructions for refining essence into qi. At dawn, repeat the previous practice: counting breaths, warming the outer kidneys, and the exercise of lifting the body with breath. Thus concludes the work of a single night. To cultivate the scrotum until it is as warm as fire—this is the true and wondrous formula of immortals.

The four-step practice of walking, standing, sitting, and lying each has its own method:
- In walking, place the feet on level ground;
- In standing, concentrate the spirit in the great void;
- In sitting, regulate the breath of the cinnabar field;
- In lying down, embrace the pearl below the navel.

Thus it is said: in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, never depart from this. *Third Chapter: The Kunyuan Classic*

In all Kun-Dao cultivation and entry into the Way, one must practice according to the method during the time after *zi* (11 PM–1 AM) and before *wu* (11 AM–1 PM), when yang qi arises. First, return to emptiness and stillness, deeply entering the primordial chaos. When the mechanism of chaos begins to open, concentrate the spirit and inhale qi to guard the *Breast Stream*, visualizing each breath residing within it. Regulate the breath silently for thirty-six cycles. Then return to emptiness and still cultivation, reaching the utmost void and profound stillness, abiding in the *Extinction Cessation Samādhi* to enter quiescence. When stillness reaches its peak and awareness returns, resume the previous practice of breath regulation and central guarding, repeating three to five times before concluding.

After practicing until the new moon, when a moving mechanism and warmth arise between the breasts, use both hands to cradle the breasts and inhale qi, guiding each breath to return its root to the *Breast Stream*. Maintain this with continuous, subtle focus—neither holding too tightly nor letting go—until breath naturally flows in and out between the breasts. Then shift the spirit downward to guard the *Yellow Court*. Gently massage the breasts with the hands, thirty-six times on each side. Next, with true intention and the spirit’s gaze, guide the qi from the sides of the ribs backward, ascending along the *Red Path* beside the spine, passing the *Jade Pillow*, entering the *Mud Pill Palace*, and converging at the *Bright Hall* above the forehead. Then descend behind the ears to the chest, where they meet and converge again, passing between the breasts and sending both into the *Yellow Court* to return to emptiness. After a brief pause, cradle the breasts and inhale qi, massaging each side thirty-six times, then guide the qi as before in three continuous cycles. Guard until the *Yellow Court* radiates light, then shift the spirit downward to guard the *Navel Wheel*.

Guard until the navel itches and exudes fluid, at which point the breasts gradually retract, assuming a male-like form. Then shift the spirit downward to guard the *Cinnabar Field*. Silently regulate the breath for thirty-six cycles to return to emptiness, guarding until the *Cinnabar Field* grows warm or a slight pain arises, like a needle’s prick—do not be alarmed, for this is harmless. When the *Red Dragon* arrives, return to emptiness and still cultivation, without regulating breath or guarding. For those aged sixteen or seventeen to twenty-four or twenty-five, the *Red Dragon* arrives for seven days before receding. For those aged twenty-six or twenty-seven to thirty-four or thirty-five, it arrives for five days. For those aged thirty-six or thirty-seven to forty-four or forty-five, it arrives for three days. After the *Red Dragon* departs and the menses are cleansed, resume guarding the *Cinnabar Field* and regulating the breath. Initially, guard the *Cinnabar Field* with gentle attention, nurturing it subtly and observing it closely. When the *Cinnabar Field* grows warm and yin qi arises, stirring desire, immediately use true intention and the spirit’s gaze to guide the qi backward, ascending along the *Red Path* to the crown of the head, reaching the *Bright Hall* without full convergence. Split into two paths, descend behind the ears to the chest, converge fully, then pass directly between the breasts into the *Cinnabar Field* without circling them. Pause briefly, then guide the qi backward again, moving swiftly and attentively in three to five continuous cycles until yin qi dissipates and desire subsides.

When yin qi stirs, it arouses passion and the urge for union. If not governed by right mindfulness—ascending behind and descending in front to repel the host of yin—one will inevitably undermine their own cultivation. Thus, practice until yin is dispelled and desire extinguished. Thereafter, employ only the work of emptying the mind and still guarding, but do not guard too intensely, lest the *Cinnabar Field* suddenly grow hot. Instead, guard gently, nurturing it subtly, allowing the true qi within to manifest—first warm, then hot, gradually intensifying like fire burning or water boiling. Even in the depths of winter, one will shed all garments, even unwrapping the feet. At this time, a Dao companion must provide protection, the chamber door tightly sealed, and one must remain deep within the bed curtains, undisturbed. With single-minded stillness, naturally enter primordial chaos. When chaos begins to open, resume still guarding until the *Joining Bones* suddenly part and true qi extends its signal. Wash the hands with warm water, then gently support upward. Guide true intention and the spirit’s gaze from the *Cinnabar Field* backward, ascending along the *Red Path* beside the spine to the crown, descending to the *Bright Hall* without full convergence, then down behind the ears to the chest, where they converge fully. Pass between the breasts into the *Yellow Court*, then down to the *Cinnabar Field*. Gently support upward, sending it into the *Secret Gate*. With true intention, circulate one full cycle—ascending behind and descending in front—three to five times, until the extended signal of true qi fully retracts. Then return to emptiness and enter samādhi, abiding in the *Extinction Cessation Samādhi* to achieve quiescence, and the *Joining Bones* will close.

Whenever heat peaks, the bones open, and the signal extends, reverse the circulation and withdraw it, then deeply enter primordial chaos for the *Joining Bones* to close. Practicing thus day and night, all joints and orifices of the body will open, the *River Chariot* will naturally reverse its flow, and true qi will naturally refine the body. As the ancients said: *"Ten thousand clusters of purple clouds pay homage to the Jade Palace; a thousand and a hundred meridians seed the Mud Pill."* One will feel a single spark of spirit-light, undivided within or without, illuminating the entire body day and night. After ten months of practice, the yang spirit will manifest, and the body will become as that of a man.

At first, there is no distinction between self and other.

It is also said: The breasts above connect to the fluids of the heart and lungs, and below extend to the meridians of the Sea of Blood. When refined until the breasts take the form of a maiden or child, this is the woman transforming into the body of a man—this achievement lies solely in the moment of sending the sweet dew. Do not send it down to the Cinnabar Field; only guide it to the Crimson Palace. Focus intention on both breasts, clench the upper and lower front teeth tightly together, close the nostrils, and use inner breathing to gather within. Externally, with the palms, rub left and right seventy-two times each, first slowly then swiftly, first lightly then heavily. After a hundred days of this, they may take the shape of two walnuts.

**Simplified Method for Women’s Practice**
Each night after the midnight hour, when naturally awakened, the mind neither clings to form nor falls into emptiness. When the Moon Grotto stirs with the tide, this is precisely the return of the first yang. Immediately gather spirit and qi into the Breast Stream, turn the light inward to illuminate the Palace of Life, seal the mouth and lower the curtain. Cradle the breasts and inhale, rubbing left and right, drawing below to activate the Central Gate and above to connect both breasts. With each breath, ensure all returns to the Palace of Life. Each cycle consists of seventy-two breaths. Practice during the first six hours, then rest in stillness for the latter six. After each session, swallow saliva three times and send it into the Womb Palace. Daily, during the hours before midnight and after noon—when yang qi arises—persist in this practice until the third day after the third yang, then proceed to refine the form. After no more than a hundred days of cultivation, the monthly flow ceases, the nipples flatten, the face blooms like a peach blossom, and one remains in a constant state of intoxication—dim and silent, the spirit-light undispersed day and night, ever-bright in stillness. After ten months of practice, a sign will naturally appear to foretell fortune or misfortune.

Initially, gather essence and blood into the breasts, then draw and rub them upward so that the essence and blood transform entirely into sweet dew, descending to the Cinnabar Field to coalesce into fetal breathing. Thus, the monthly tide halts, and the nipples naturally flatten. Within the Lower Cinnabar Field, the Sacred Embryo spontaneously forms, requiring no effort to gather it. Simply concentrate the spirit within the fetal breathing, relying on Cessation Samādhi to achieve quiescence. After a hundred days of quiescent illumination, in a state of vague indistinction, the Sacred Embryo will seem to stir. The woman will appear as one intoxicated, her eyes often closed in weariness, her face radiating light and color, her body enveloped in golden radiance day and night. Nurtured for ten months, the Sacred Embryo reaches completion, and she naturally sheds her form to become an immortal spirit, her transformations beyond measure.

This concise manual reveals the ultimate principles of heaven and earth, life and nature, laying bare the return of principle and qi. It may be tested against the Three Kings without error, established within heaven and earth without contradiction, and verified by spirits and gods without doubt. Even after a hundred generations, it awaits the sage without confusion—this is the true, constant Dao.
