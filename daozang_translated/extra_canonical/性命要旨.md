**Preface by Cheng Shouyi of Xin’an**

Observe the people of this world: those who do not seek fame are avaricious for profit, and those who neither seek nor covet are indeed rare. Only the Daoist cultivators, embodying the fundamental method of the Primordial Unity and the pivot of Heaven and Earth, establish the great furnace and cauldron to refine their true essence, utterly free from entanglements. They abide in ease with conditions, thus differing entirely from the common folk.

In that year, while sojourning in Hanyang, I chanced upon Master Ke Huaijing and Master Wang Dongting. Their bearing was refined and elegant, their character lofty and transcendent, exuding an air of detachment from the mundane. Upon further inquiry into their conduct, I learned that the two masters often retired to secluded places, sitting knee-to-knee to discourse on the Dao, their conversations ever delightful and unceasing.

I then said to them: "The learning of you two masters is devoted to the cultivation of the self. Why not compose a book to disseminate it throughout the world, teaching later generations to refine their wisdom and align their destinies, that all may together attain the realm of longevity and establish an enduring merit of virtue?"

The two masters replied: "Your words are kind. Yet the Dao is supremely impartial—how could we dare to hoard it for ourselves? Without arduous inquiry, thorough investigation, and the guidance of an enlightened teacher, how could one ever encounter this great Dao?"

Thereupon, they produced two volumes of writings for my perusal. I discovered that *Yangxing Bian* was composed by Master Ke, while *Xingming Yaozhi* was authored by Master Wang. Upon reading them, I found the prose elegant, the scholarship profound, and the transmission of the Daoist lineage of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi unbroken. The words are plain, yet the principles are meticulously expounded, revealing the profound mechanisms of the "Yellow Bell and Jade Pitchpipe." I am thus moved to urge their publication, combining the two scrolls into a single volume to be made public throughout the land. This will serve as a swift path for learners to gather the medicine and refine the elixir, a compassionate vessel for transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.

For those who may have strayed into heterodox schools, encountering this book may guide them from deviation to rectitude. For those misled by false teachers, encountering this book may help them discern falsity and awaken to truth, dispelling heresies and entering the true Dao. Thus shall the boundless benevolence of the two masters in bestowing longevity upon the world not be in vain.

With this, I, in my ignorance and presumption, venture to compose this preface as a record.

Written on the auspicious day of the Lotus Month in the fifteenth year of the Guangxu reign, by Cheng Shouyi of Xin’an, bowing in respect at Yunhe Mountain Lodge.

**Author’s Preface**

I have heard that the study of the Mysterious...

Since the Yellow Emperor inquired of Guangchengzi to inaugurate its beginnings, and Laozi composed the *Daodejing* to reveal its source, from antiquity to the present, those who have attained immortality and realized the Dao have all taken the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as their patriarchs. By nature, I have been devoted to the study of the Mysterious, collecting alchemical classics and philosophical works, and perusing Daoist scriptures and historical texts for many years. Though I have gained some understanding of its principles, I have yet to grasp its secrets. Thus, I wandered rivers and lakes, traversing famous mountains in search of enlightened masters for twelve years.

One day, passing through Mount Lu, I chanced upon the venerable Wu Tianzhi. Observing his dignified and untrammeled demeanor, I knew he was no ordinary man. I inquired of him regarding the profound mysteries, to which he replied, "Though you possess the affinity for immortality, I fear you may begin with diligence but end in laxity." I served him with the reverence of a disciple and again sought his secrets. Moved by boundless compassion, he then transmitted the method of the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions, the Great Elixir of Golden Liquor, and the subtleties of fire-times and sequential stages. I comprehended these with heart and spirit, suddenly achieving thorough understanding. Only then did I realize that the Great Dao originally resides within oneself—it is never to be sought externally.

Later, in Han, I encountered four or five fellow Daoists: Ke Huaijing, Li Yunlan, Zhou Junfu, and Ke Zaishu. Together, we delved deeply into the teachings, swiftly grasping their entirety. Only then did I understand the principle of beginning with the dual cultivation of essence and life, that the way of human birth and immortal transcendence share a single source. In the initial practice, one clearly perceives the Mysterious Pass; at the first stirring of primordial yang, spirit enters the qi cavity, giving rise to the mechanism of generation.

Next, the "Earth Fruit" returns to life, and within the abdomen, one senses a living, vibrant presence, like a pearl rolling in a dish. Then, lead and mercury merge to return to true earth, issuing forth from the aperture as primordial true lead—this is called the "birth of the medicine." Next, the medicinal substances are gathered into the furnace, sealed, and stilled to subdue spirit and qi. Then, as qi fills the Governing and Conception Vessels, at midnight, yang fire is advanced to gather at the crown; at dawn, one bathes to augment the lead. At noon, yin符 is withdrawn to descend to the Kun Palace; at dusk, one bathes to augment the mercury.

Next, when the celestial cycle is complete and the lead qi has fully ascended, it coalesces into a lump of dry mercury—this is the elixir. Then, employing the seven-day gathering practice, spirit converges within the cauldron, and the great medicine begins to sprout. Next, when refinement reaches the stage where the fire-pearl manifests, the great medicine is drawn from the furnace. Circulating it through the great celestial orbit, it penetrates the three posterior passes, descends the "tower of many stories," and settles into the Yellow Court. Finally, one nurtures the Dao-embryo in quiescence; when, after ten months, the embryo is fully formed and qi is abundant, it ascends to the upper field.

Dwelling within the Muddy Pellet, for a hundred days one closes the eyes in darkness—only then does the vision of heavenly flowers raining down appear, and the scene of spirit-exit arrives. Next, regulating the spirit to emerge from the casing, it first exits through the crown gate; when the golden light grows as large as a chariot wheel, it is gathered back into the upper field. Next, with each exit and entry, gradually becoming ever more refined, one gains the power to traverse heaven and earth. Thereupon the body transforms into bodies, multiplying endlessly without count—what the ancients called the "thousand-hundred-million transformations."

Next, the myriad distinctions return to the one root; refining the spirit to return to emptiness, the work of cultivation reaches completion, and one forever becomes a guest of the imperial realm. To enable students to grasp its essentials and avoid confusion between earlier and later stages, I have, despite my humble and unworthy abilities, compiled this volume, entitled *Essentials of Nature and Life*, to illuminate the profound learning and widely open the gates of the Dao. Yet I dare not claim it as my own creation, for I have drawn from the oral instructions of the immortals, verifying them in summary. My deepest hope is that all under heaven may cultivate this great Dao, ascend to the upper realms, and together enjoy celestial blessings.

Written in the mid-autumn of the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign, by Wang Dongting of Haiyang (at the Moon-Gazing Pavilion of the Northern Study Grass Hall).

*Nature and Life, Part One: The Great Dao’s Commencement*

Within lies the unity of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life)—grasp their handle.

Dongting states: Of all learning, none surpasses that of *xing* and *ming*. Yet the study of *xing* and *ming* has long been obscured in the world. Thus, I now expound the profound essentials of *xing* and *ming* to illuminate them.

Before father and mother conceived us, *xing* and *ming* were originally one. When the ten-month gestation is complete and *qi* is full, the form stirs and the womb ruptures—like a fall from a high mountain striking the earth with a single crash. At this moment, *xing* and *ming* separate. From then on, *xing* cannot perceive *ming*, nor *ming* perceive *xing*. Youth gives way to maturity, maturity to old age, old age to death.

Thus, the sages of antiquity, moved by great compassion, taught later generations of students to re-enter the womb and recreate their *xing* and *ming*, guiding their spirit and *qi* into the cavity to reunite them. The ancients called this the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*—this is the Dao of immortality. The union of man and woman is the mundane Dao. Though the mundane Dao and the immortal Dao differ, their essence is one.

In the mundane Dao, the woman is wed to the man; in the immortal Dao, the man is wed to the woman. In the mundane Dao, mercury departs to seek lead; in the immortal Dao, lead comes to seek mercury. The mundane Dao is *wei ji* (unfulfilled); the immortal Dao is *ji ji* (fulfilled). The mundane Dao follows the natural course; the immortal Dao reverses it. Following the natural course brings life and death; reversing it ensures eternal preservation through ten thousand kalpas.

In the mundane Dao, after a woman conceives, a thing the size of a bean is felt pulsing below the navel—medical texts call this the *taiyuan* (fetal origin). From the *taiyuan* arises the five viscera and six bowels, the four limbs and hundred bones, the ability to see and hear, to grasp and walk, to embody benevolence and righteousness, propriety and wisdom, to attain sageliness and spirit, literature and martial arts. If one comprehends this principle, it is the *taiyuan* formed by the union of an ordinary father and mother.

In the immortal Dao, after the *dantou* (elixir head) is formed, a thing the size of a bean is also felt pulsing below the navel. Yet this treasure of *ming* is a secret of heaven, and the sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, though leaving behind alchemical classics and texts, have never spoken of it plainly. Through artful metaphors and symbolic language, its myriad names and thousand designations all refer to this thing and this cavity.

Without knowing this cavity, to seek the Dao is like wading through water to catch chickens and rabbits or climbing a mountain to search for fish and dragons. As Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng said: "To practice cultivation without knowing the *xuanguan* (mysterious pass) is like entering a dark room." If one does not know the *xuanguan*, from where does one gather and refine? Where does one seek the true seed? From where do the medicine and ingredients arise? Where is the crucible established? Where does the *zhou tian* (microcosmic orbit) circulate? Where does the *yang huo* (yang fire) advance? Where does the *yin fu* (yin tally) retreat? Where do *mao* and *you* (the hours of the rabbit and rooster) bathe? The entire process of the small *zhou tian*, from beginning to end, operates through the *xuanguan*.

If one comprehends this principle, it is the *xuanguan* formed by the union of the sacred father and numinous mother. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: "This cavity is no ordinary cavity—it is jointly formed by heaven and earth." Without the *taiyuan*, the mundane Dao cannot give birth to sons and daughters; without the *xuanguan*, how can the immortal Dao enable one to become a buddha or an ancestor?

Students must first understand the principle of the *xuanguan* before proceeding to practice—thus the mind has a master. Those who attain this method find it utterly simple and easy; those who do not grow ever more entangled and difficult.

Know that for every heaven there must be an earth, for every day a moon, for every man a woman, for every dragon a tiger, for every tortoise a snake, for every male a female, for every *yin* a *yang*. As the *Yijing* says: "The Dao is called the unity of *yin* and *yang*." Master Lü said: "In the profound texts, *yin* and *yang* are spoken of in myriad ways—they are the king of all methods." Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng said: "A woman without a husband is a resentful maiden; a man without a wife is a forlorn bachelor." All things in the world come in pairs.

If one can understand the union of two eights and the fusion of three and five, one will naturally comprehend one thing and awaken to a hundred, suddenly achieving thorough understanding. With diligent study of the alchemical classics and careful reflection, nothing will remain obscure. Thereafter, faith will grow ever firmer, and practice ever more sincere—like parting the clouds and mist to behold the sun and sky.

As Baopuzi said: "In the world, there are those who love the Dao..."

Without witnessing this method, one would never know of such wondrous matters in the world, for without encountering a true master, there would be no way to hear of them. In youth, one begins practice and immediately sees results. If no effect is seen in an instant, the master is false, deceiving the foolish—how could one trust such a one?

Yet the Dao holds three secrets: first, *caiqu* (gathering and refinement); second, *yaowu* (elixir materials); third, *huohou* (firing times). Beyond these three lies the *xuanguan* (mysterious pass). As Sanfeng said: *"If one does not recognize the true locus of the mysterious pass, where can one place the true lead once gathered?"* If one knows only the *xuanguan* but not *caiqu*, it is as Zi Yang said: *"When lead meets the birth of *gui*, swiftly gather it; when gold reaches its fullness, it is no longer fit to taste."* If one knows only *caiqu* but not *yaowu*, it is as Zi Yang said: *"If the crucible lacks the true seed, one merely boils water and fire in an empty cauldron."*

If one knows *caiqu*, *yaowu*, and *xuanguan* but not *huohou*, it is as Shangyangzi said: *"Though the external fire moves, the internal tally remains closed, and breath does not respond—one’s spiritual efforts are wasted."* Even in progressive stages of practice, the *wen* (civil) and *wu* (martial) firing times are like arithmetic: nine nines are eighty-one, resolved through division. Within this lies the subtlest detail.

"Teach others to strike when they see the *zi* hour. Thus, the method of regulating the breath: if one knows how to draw in *qi*, the mind grows ever more refined, and the *qi* ever more subtle. With merely dozens of breaths—no more than a hundred—*qi* naturally settles in the lower *dantian*. Then the breath becomes long and deep. If it rises above the *sanjiao*, the breath becomes short and hurried. This is why the thousand-year-old spirit turtle excels at regulating the breath.

"As the sunlight shines downward, the sea water naturally surges upward. When the tide arrives, the *xiantian qi* is born. The *Ruyao Jing* states: *'The* xiantian qi *and* houtian qi—*those who attain them are ever as if drunk.'* This is the truth.

"When the *qi* of Heaven descends and the *qi* of Earth ascends, the myriad things begin to grow. When male essence harmonizes with female blood, the origin of the embryo is formed. The Dao of the Elixir is the same. Ancestor Jingyang said: *'Let me reveal to you the secrets of my lineage: the Great Yang shifts into the bright moon.'* He also said: *'When the essence of the sun unites with the radiance of the moon, true lead will naturally emerge in the world.'* Ke Huaijing said: *'The golden crow within the sun...'* "

Flying into the Broad Cold,
this is what is called the yin *qi* within the heart
going to harmonize with the yang *qi* within the kidneys.
When yin *qi* obtains this yang *qi*,
then there is a place for settling the body and establishing life.

Chaoyuanzi said:
*"Southern blood is mercury within cinnabar,
Northern essence is lead within water."*

Ke Huaijing said:
*"The wind sways the willow, and lead’s nature appears;
the rain sprinkles the peach blossom, and mercury’s essence unfolds."*

Ma Ziran said:
*"Lead and mercury dwell within the crucible,
refined into a priceless pearl.
All comes down to two words,
which comprehend the myriad scrolls of all families."*

Master Zhongli said:
*"Apart from the two medicines of lead and mercury,
all else is but deception to delude the foolish."*

To cultivate the primordial Great Dao,
the subtlety lies in beginning with the one yang.
The Winter Solstice is the one yang of the year;
the moon’s emergence at *geng* is the one yang of the month;
the *zi* hour is the one yang of day and night.

Disciple,
you must understand the one yang within your own body.
The one yang within the body is the rising of the external kidneys.
Rising without thought is pure;
rising with thought is impure.
How can this not be thoroughly investigated?

Ke Huaijing said:

At the first stirring of the one yang, the heart knows it well—
this is precisely when the alchemist begins.

Master Huayang said:
*"The moment yang arises is the moment to set hand to work.
If one can act at this time,
what doubt or hesitation could remain?"*

When lead returns,
direct a single drop of mercury to meet it—
this is the moment of congealing spirit into qi.

In daily practice,
one must rely on the *xun* wind’s breath to fan it,
so that lead is wholly transformed into qi.

Master Qiyun said:
*"People consume the five grains,
which turn into yin essence, never refined.
This substance lurks within, causing mischief.
Simply use the qi of the cinnabar field’s natural breath
to stir the true fire within.
Water above, fire below—
when water meets fire, it naturally vaporizes into qi.
This qi rises, steaming and permeating,
passing through all the body’s gates and channels,
flowing through the hundred meridians.
The inner fire burns so fiercely that spirits wail and demons shriek,
refining the yin essence to its end.
Thus the yin demons disperse."*

Master You Mizi said:
*"Yin essence is the essence of the five grains and drink.
Without the fierce refining of the *xun* wind and *kun* fire,
this essence will remain in the body,
stirring lustful thoughts and disturbing the sovereign heart.
One must concentrate the spirit and regulate the breath,
using the bellows to fan the wind,
so that wind stokes the fire,
refining the yin essence into qi.
The martial fire both gathers and refines lead,
while the civil fire nurtures and augments mercury.
The ancients called this ‘civil refining and martial smelting.’"*

The so-called *xun* wind is the qi of postnatal breathing, the mother qi. The True One qi of the prenatal is the child qi. Using mother qi to subdue child qi is like a cat catching a rat—seeing the thief, it seizes at once. This is the method of employing wind. At the *zi* hour, use martial fire; at other times, use civil fire. Using the bellows is martial fire; not using the bellows is civil fire. Yet without a master’s transmission, the fire times remain difficult to know on one’s own.

The Dao of Heaven moves without a single breath’s pause; the Dao of the Elixir flows without a single breath’s halt. One must practice until there is no breath at all to form the Great Elixir. Then the prenatal qi arrives from emptiness and nothingness, truly swift. If one awakens to great clarity, one falls into the postnatal—no longer the pure and true qi of the prenatal. If even slightly delayed, it transforms through the channels into turbid essence and leaks away, becoming useless.

The *Wuzhen Pian* says:
*"Seen, it cannot be used;
Used, it cannot be seen.
In the dim and indistinct, they meet;
In the distant and obscure, there is transformation."*

The ancients’ metaphors were most apt, yet today’s people remain confused in their hearts, instead claiming the alchemical classics never speak plainly. How lamentable!

At every living *zi* hour...

When the outer form rises, the spirit enters the qi cavity. Apply the martial fire for fierce refinement. After a short while, the yang wilts—then employ the civil fire for gentle nurturing, whether for a month or a hundred days. Thus the Mysterious Pass within one’s body will naturally reveal itself.

Master Tianzhi said: *"If one knows the two substances of lead and mercury and unites them into one, then the Mysterious Pass first takes form."* Ke Huaijing said: *"The Mysterious Pass is originally nonexistent; it arises only after spirit and qi merge."* Master Shangyang said: *"When the two take shape, one thing is born."* The *Wuhua Pian* states: *"When yin and yang contend, the magic mushroom grows without root; when dryness and dampness nurture, the grub is born without mother."*

The above speaks of the method for establishing the Mysterious Pass. Laozi said: *"Dimly, dimly—within it there is something; obscurely, obscurely—within it there is essence."* Zhuangzi said: *"In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun."* Wei Boyang said: *"Know the white, guard the black—spiritual clarity will come of itself."* The alchemical classics say: *"True lead, true mercury—people do not recognize them. A crescent of pure moon emerges."*

This chapter speaks of the Mysterious Pass’s initial formation, when beneath the five yin, the first yang arises. Ancestor Sanfeng said: *"The Mysterious Pass comes and goes without fixed position."* He also said: *"The Yellow Court’s every path is the Mysterious Pass."* These two lines describe the Mysterious Pass after it has long been revealed—vivid and free, never fixed in direction.

Pure Yang Ancestor said:
*"Mysterious Female, Mysterious Female—true Mysterious Female!
Not in the heart, nor in the kidneys.
Seek exhaustively the origin where life received its qi.
No wonder the celestial mechanism is wholly revealed."*

*Awakening to Reality* says:
*"I urge you: seek exhaustively the place where life began.
Returning to the root and reverting to the origin—this is the Medicine King."*

These two passages speak of the revealed locus of the Mysterious Pass:
in men, the qi-cavity;
in women, the womb.
Yet the qi-cavity and the womb—
their ground is one,
their position the same.
The difference between them lies solely in inversion—
inversion, nothing more.

What is "the middle"?
Master Cheng said: *"Neither leaning nor tilting—this is it."*
Those who know this Way say:
*"The noble person embodies the constant mean."*
Those who do not know it say:
*"The petty person deviates from the constant mean."*

What is "inversion"?
The *Yi* says: *"Earth above, Heaven below—this is Peace."*
Once you know inversion as inversion,
you may steal the mechanism of Heaven and Earth
and complete the work of creation.

Cheng Yifangchuan said:
*"If one does not steal the mechanism of creation,
how can one attain long life?"*

*The Scripture of Uniting with the Dao in Accordance with the Hidden* says:
*"As for the mechanism of theft—
those who know it hold their fate in their own hands,
no longer subject to Heaven."*

Within the six directions, there is but one hollow cavity—
where above, Heaven, and below, Earth, unite in congress.
Within this hollow cavity,
the eastern sun and western moon
circulate beyond its bounds,
and the ten thousand things thereby attain ceaseless generation.
This truly arises from the mutual resonance of Heaven and Earth,
the ceaseless revolutions of sun and moon.

Though Heaven and Earth resonate,
though sun and moon revolve,
without Earth as their root and foundation,
how could the ten thousand things arise?
Yet without Earth, the Five Phases are incomplete;
without Earth, the Five Metals do not grow;
without Earth, the Five Grains do not ripen;
without Earth, the Golden Elixir does not form.
From beginning to end, the Golden Elixir relies entirely upon True Earth for its completion.

Now, this Earth is Intent—
not the Intent of later heaven, but the True Intent of prior heaven.
Master Yin said:
*"True Intent is Qian’s primordial essence,
the mother of Heaven and Earth,
the root of yin and yang,
the source of water and fire,
the origin of sun and moon."*

Why, then, do the Three converge and unite at the Mysterious Pass?
The Eastern Pavilion replied:
*"If not at the Mysterious Pass, where else could the root and foundation be established?"*

The *Ancient Text in Gold and Azure* says:
*"At the waxing moon, eight ounces of Metal;
at the waning moon, half a pound of Water.
When the two phases unite their essence,
the body of Qian and Kun is complete."*
This is the meaning.

Master Tianzhi said:

Those who cultivate with diligent effort see swift results—merely two or three months, or at most a hundred days. Once the Mysterious Cavity is replenished, the substance ascends to the Heart Palace and descends to the Kidney Mansion, flowing freely in all directions, unobstructed in its course. Zhuangzi said: *"Transformed, it becomes a bird, named Peng."* The alchemical classics call it the *Bodhi-seed*, or the *Śarīra-seed*, or the *millet-like Mysterious Pearl*, or the *Ginseng Fruit*—its names are myriad. Yet all are but metaphors for the seed within our body, for the Mysterious Pass within us, for the Great Ultimate within us.

Disciple, when you refine to this stage, guard strictly against lust. Should you transgress in such matters, at worst it leads to death, at best to madness. How can you not take heed?

In the *Treatise on Nature and Life*, the medicinal substances, firing times, and the Greater and Lesser Celestial Cycles are refined according to method, culminating in the Ninefold Transmutation that makes one an immortal.

The Eastern Pavilion said: *"When the Mysterious Cavity is filled to overflowing, the cauldron naturally generates medicinal substances—this is called the True Unity’s qi, or the primordial True Lead."*

Zhang Sanfeng said: *"It is only taken from within the household—why seek it outside?"*

The *Wondrous Realization* states: *"This supreme treasure exists in every home, yet fools fail to recognize it fully."*

Lu Ziye said: *"Every household has it, every household has it—how few know it, how few reclaim it."*

Bai Yuchan said: *"Originally, true gold lies within the home."*

A poem on cultivation says:
*"At any time, the medicinal ingredients are taken from within the household."*
And again:
*"Recognize the true seed in your own garden,
and well gather the white lotus from the sea of essence."*

All references to "within the household," "every household," or "the garden" denote one’s own body. Do not heed the misguided interpretations of false teachers.

Now, the medicinal substances await their arising.

In an instant, an itch arises in the pores and fine hairs, the limbs grow soft as silk, and the mind feels hazy. The medicinal qi from the crucible surges outward, and the Jade Stem stands firm and hard—this is what the alchemical classics call the "Child Hour of Medicinal Birth."

Master Huayang said: *"This is the manifestation of medicinal birth—do not be startled or alarmed. The slightest flicker of doubt will scatter the spirit and disperse the qi. All thoughts must cease at once; meet it with emptiness. Do not rashly apply the martial fire of measured urgency, nor lose the true moment. Simply listen in stillness to the movement and flourishing of the qi."*

Master Chongxu said: *"Aware yet unaware, one reawakens to the true primordial. 'Aware yet unaware' means the yang qi has not yet flourished—do not hastily advance the martial fire. 'Reawakening to the true primordial' means the yang qi has flourished, and at this moment, one must swiftly proceed to gather and refine the medicine."*

How can one know whether the medicinal substance is neither too old nor too tender when gathering it? As Zhang Sanfeng said: *"The moon’s fullness depends on the oral formula; the Child Hour’s subtlety lies in the heart’s transmission."* And Bai Yuchan said: *"The moon’s fullness is clearly spoken in the oral formula; the Child Hour’s truth is faithfully passed through the heart’s transmission."* Thus, the medicine is gathered into the furnace.

Thus, for one *hou*, employ martial fire to seal and secure, then cease breathing. For the next *hou*, apply civil fire. As Patriarch Bodhidharma said: *"The moment of gathering the muṇi—this is it."* And Zhang Sanfeng said: *"The elixir is accomplished in just two *hou*."* This, too, refers to the same. He further stated: *"The remaining four *hou* hold divine efficacy—this is the minor celestial cycle, the four *hou* of ascent, descent, and ablution."* Master Jiwu of Stillness said: *"In gathering, the medicine ascends along the Governing Vessel to the Mud Pill Palace; in refinement, it descends along the Conception Vessel to the Cinnabar Field—this constitutes one celestial cycle."* Xu Jingsun said: *"Qian’s function is nine, accumulating yang lines to two hundred sixteen—this is the count for withdrawing lead. Kun’s function is six, accumulating yin lines to one hundred forty-four—this is the measure for adding mercury."* Liu Huayang said: *"Twelve measures make one celestial cycle."* Wu Chongxu said: *"At zi, advance the yang fire thirty-six; rest the fire at mao—this is called ablution. At wu, retreat the yin tally twenty-four; cease the tally at you—this is called ablution. This constitutes one celestial cycle."* Chen Niniu said: *"The twelve celestial hours: when the movement reaches the mao position, punishment prevails; when it arrives at the you region, virtue is born—this constitutes one celestial cycle."* The *Cantong Qi* said: *"The twelve months: at the spring equinox, elm leaves fall; at the autumn equinox, wheat sprouts—this constitutes one celestial cycle."*

The methods for the minor celestial cycle are manifold; we shall not enumerate them all here. Some complete their practice after several dozen cycles, others after over a hundred, and there are even those who fulfill it after several hundred. In sum, each movement is a refinement; refine and refine again, cycle upon cycle. It is also said: *"Accumulation beyond a hundred days ensures that essence does not leak and qi returns."* Zhang Sanfeng said: *"Proceeding thus in practice, the foundation may be swiftly established—there is no need to wait a hundred days."*

Liu Huayang said: "The hundred days denote the refinement of essence. For those diligent in practice in their youth, the elixir may be swiftly attained—thus the hundred days may be anticipated. Yet for those of middle age or advanced years, no fixed term can be set, for there may be those whose external yang does not arise. One must refine until external yang arises; and when external yang arises, one must further refine until external yang no longer arises. Why does external yang no longer arise? Because the lead-qi has flown away entirely, and a lump of dry mercury has been refined—only then does the turtle retract and not rise. The Buddhist scriptures say: *To accomplish the Tathāgata’s ‘hidden male organ’ sign.* The *Huangting Jing* says: *Seal the path of essence, and one may live long.* Li Xu’an said: *Once the Gate of Yang is sealed, each attains longevity.* The *Guizhi* states: *Day by day, thus engage in union, thus draw and add. Mercury gradually increases, lead gradually diminishes. Over time, lead nears exhaustion, and mercury too dries. It coalesces into a single mani-pearl—this is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor.* The *Wuzhen Pian* says: *To use lead, one must not use common lead; having used true lead, discard it. This is the true esoteric method of using lead. To use lead yet not use it is a sincere word.* Chaoyuanzi said: *When mercury dries, lead naturally falls away.* The Perfected Purple Worthies said: *When disciples inquire of the Dao at this stage, they know the difficulty of repaying their teacher’s grace. They should pledge their hearts beneath the sun and sky, vowing to attain the Dao to requite their teacher’s kindness. To betray a teacher’s grace is to betray the sun and sky.* Ziye the Perfected said: *The method of using lead is like the snare and trap for catching fish and hare. Fish and hare rely on snare and trap to be caught; once fish and hare are obtained, snare and trap are of no further use.* Zhang Ziyang said: *At first, in effortful practice, few perceive; only when effortless do the many begin to know. Yet though effortlessness is deemed essential and wondrous, how could one know that effortful practice is the root and foundation? Effortful practice is union, foundation-building, life-cultivation, the work of destiny—regulating, gathering, and refining the medicine.*

To mend their deficiencies is to secure the stem of life. The effortless is the refinement of the self—cultivation of the nature. As for the nature: one must relinquish the three minds, extinguish the four forms, sever the six desires, and cut off the seven passions. All worldly concerns are forgotten, thereby nurturing the root of the nature.

Bai Yuchan said:
*The root of nature, the stem of life—
same origin, different names, distinct kinds.
Conjoined in one place, they congeal the elixir,
returning to the primordial, precelestial qi.*
Truly these are his words.

When the elixir-refining reaches the moment of pure yang and exhausted yin, a yang radiance will naturally appear at the space between the brows. Upon the third manifestation of this yang light, one must swiftly cease the firing. Should one fail to know restraint, peril will surely follow. The Perfected Purple Yang said:
*If one clings to fullness without ceasing,
one cannot avoid one day meeting disgrace.*

What is called "ceasing the fire" means halting the postcelestial martial fire and instead employing the natural civil fire. The *Wuzhen Pian* says:
*There is a natural true firing,
no need for kindling or fanning breaths.*

Thereupon, the true qi fully congeals within the crucible, concealed and never emerging. Earlier, it was said that the lesser medicine arises first and is then gathered; here, however, it is said that the greater medicine is gathered first and then arises. One must employ the seven-day gathering work. Its method of gathering...

With the radiance of both eyes,
return the gaze to the crucible within.
With the acuity of both ears,
return the hearing to the crucible within.
With the spirit of the heart,
fix attention upon the crucible within.
Once or twice, or three to five times a day and night,
at other times abiding in profound quiescence.
Thus practicing,
by the seventh day,
the suspended embryo forms within the crucible,
and the greater medicine first germinates.
The *Huangting Jing* says:
*Day and night for seven days, contemplate without sleep.*
The *Yi* states:
*In seven days, return comes.*
It also says:
*In returning, the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth is revealed.*
The alchemical classics say:
*The Heavenly Maiden offers flowers, the Dragon Maiden presents the pearl—*
this is precisely it.

In the earlier lesser celestial cycle,
the original dual kidneys simmered the decoction,
the eyes emitted golden light,
the ears heard the sound of wind,
the crane behind the brain cried,
the body surged with movement,
the nose twitched with qi.
Having experienced these signs,
one should gather the greater medicine and withdraw it from the furnace,
then practice the work of the greater celestial cycle.
With stillness, illuminate;
with softness, employ.
Await the movement to guide,
protect and proceed.
Guard against the perils of treacherous paths,
and the method of passing the barrier is attained.
Wu Chongxu said:
*The Five Dragons bear the Sage.*
The alchemical classics say:
*Turning the spirit to enter samādhi—*
this is it.

At this moment, the medicine
naturally flows and moves,
lively and buoyant,
surging upward to the heart.
If the heart’s palace cannot be penetrated,
it turns back toward the lower field,
advancing to the Yang Pass.
When the Yang Pass is closed,
it turns to the rear,
rushing toward the tailbone.
If the tailbone is blocked,
it races toward the valley path.
Should the valley path open and one fail to guard it,
the greater medicine will leak away,
and all prior effort is wasted.
This is the peril of the lower Magpie Bridge.
One must cross it with true intention,
and then there will be no danger.

When the greater medicine surges toward the tailbone yet fails to penetrate, it naturally ascends along the spine, piercing the Jade Pillow and directly piercing the crown gate. The Buddha said: *"An arrow shot through nine layers of iron drums"*—this is its meaning. Then it descends forward to the Hall of Impressions. Should the marrow there obstruct its passage, one fears it may recklessly rush toward the hollow cavity beneath the nose and leak away. If it leaks, all prior effort is wasted—this is the peril of the upper Magpie Bridge. Disciples must take heed and guard against it. One must guide it with true intention past the Hall of Impressions, descending through the Twelve-Storied Tower. The ancients called this *"ingesting the elixir,"* and also said: *"A single grain of golden elixir swallowed into the belly—only then does one know my fate is not ruled by Heaven."*

When the elixir reaches the chamber of spirit, it transmutes the yin spirit—this is called *"taking from Kan to fill Li, restoring Qian and Kun to their proper places."* Such is the method of the great celestial cycle. Once the greater medicine returns to the central palace, one must employ the method of *"embracing the origin and guarding the One."* This method is like a dragon nurturing its pearl, like a hen brooding her egg. The ancients called it *"nurturing the Dao-embryo."* The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *"The Way cannot be departed from for even a moment."* The *Book of Documents* says: *"Faithfully holding to the center"*—this is it.

The primordial spirit shines in stillness upon the central and lower fields, merging with them into a single realm of emptiness. Thus the primordial spirit quietly nurtures the Dao-embryo. Guarding it for two or three months, the movement of primordial qi grows ever more subtle, the discriminating nature gradually wears away, and the true nature gradually awakens. Guarding it for four or five months, the primordial qi, through the primordial spirit’s still illumination, severs all need for food and drink—this is the *"embryonic immortal."* Guarding it for six or seven months, all drowsiness vanishes, and the head and eyes grow clear and bright. Guarding it for eight or nine months, the hundred vessels come to rest, and the mouth and nose cease all breathing. Guarding it until the full term of ten months, the primordial spirit attains great stillness, now fully yang. Master Huayang said: *"Ten months of firing the Dao-embryo, a year of bathing practice"*—this is precisely it. Thus the work reaches this stage.

Then one gains the power of wisdom and insight, and naturally manifests the verification of the Six Penetrations. The Six Penetrations are: the penetration of the exhaustion of outflows, the divine eye, the divine ear, knowledge of past lives, knowledge of others’ minds, and the penetration of spiritual states. When refining essence earlier, if essence does not leak away, one attains the penetration of the exhaustion of outflows—only thereafter may the other five penetrations be obtained. The divine eye allows one to observe affairs in the heavens; the divine ear allows one to hear speech in the heavens; knowledge of past lives allows one to understand the causes of former existences; knowledge of others’ minds allows one to know past and future events. Only the penetration of spiritual states, if governed by the discriminating spirit, delights in foretelling worldly fortunes and misfortunes yet fails to protect the sovereign of the mind, will lead one into demonic paths—how lamentable! One must be wise yet not employ it, thus transforming consciousness into wisdom, only then is the nature stabilized and the embryo perfected.

When the embryo is fully matured and the spirit is wholly pure, at this time one knows only the spirit and no longer knows qi. The discriminating nature dies while the true nature awakens. The embryo cannot be retained for long, lest one suffer from a stagnant embryo. Employ the method of transference, moving from the middle and lower fields to the upper field. Master Yin said: *"The five qi all ascend to the upper origin; the three flowers gather at the crown of the head."* Nurture it in stillness for a hundred days until the work is pure. With the inner gaze slightly open, one suddenly sees sixfold radiance scattering in all directions, filling the six directions—this is the sign that the spirit is about to emerge. With a sudden thunderclap, the primordial spirit exits through the heavenly gate. Take care not to be startled, for if startled, the golden light will scatter. Should strange apparitions appear, do not acknowledge them. Wait until the golden light assumes the form of a chariot wheel, then gather it back into the upper field. Nurture it for seven days, then let it emerge again, only to be gathered once more. With each exit and return, proceed from near to far, never skipping stages. The infant spirit is young and may lose its way or forget to return. If heavenly demons come to test you and disturb the sovereign of the mind, you must be cautious in your comings and goings to attain the body of Great Emptiness. As the ancients said: *"When the Dao rises a foot, demons rise ten."* Many practitioners whose refinement is not yet pure often falter at this stage.

After three years of nursing, the yang spirit matures and can traverse earth and heaven, enter water without drowning, enter fire without burning, and pass through metal and stone without obstruction—only after verifying these signs may one proceed to the work of refining the spirit and returning to emptiness. Nine years of wall-facing practice bring one to the perfection of both form and spirit, awaiting the imperial edict of the cinnabar script before realizing the fruit of heavenly immortality and enjoying boundless blessings. As the ancients said: *"Heaven and earth perish in time, but the immortal’s life knows no limit."* Master Ke Huaijing said: *"The myriad things return to their origin in a single circle."* Though these words may seem simple, they hold profound truth.

The method is transmitted from the immortals. If later students diligently study this book and practice with devotion, they will without exception witness its efficacy. Should one depart from worldly dust and transcend mundane ties, the ninefold elixir will be perfected, and in short order, one may ride alongside Zhong and Lü. *Supplementary Chapter One*: Men and women, young and old, may all cultivate the Dao. The subtleties of its profound principles become self-evident upon a single reading.

Dongting said: *"In the cultivation of truth, both men and women work upon their own bodies. There is no difference in the initial stages of practice, though slight variations arise later. Men refine qi by beginning in the Kan palace—the Kan palace being the lower cinnabar field beneath the navel, which medical texts call the inner kidneys. Women refine form by initiating practice from the Li position—the Li position being the space between the two breasts, which the ancients called the breast chamber."*

Liu Wuyuan said: *"The sun refines qi for men; the moon refines form for women. Know that refining qi is refining lead, while refining form is refining mercury. Men who do not recognize true mercury possess yang without yin; women who do not recognize true lead possess yin without yang. Thus, in men’s cultivation of the Dao, they subdue the White Tiger; in women’s cultivation, they sever the Red Dragon. In the final stages of practice, men and women proceed alike. If a man knows true mercury, he will understand the final step of refining form; if a woman knows true lead, she will grasp the final step of returning the elixir—what Ziyang called ‘the later practice endures.’"*

Some, in their old age when spirit and vitality wane and yang no longer arises, may wish to cultivate the Dao but often fear they are incapable. Yet Master Sanfeng said: *"The aged may still be cured by medicine—seek a true teacher and inquire of the method. Were these words empty?"*

Here now is the method without need for further inquiry. First select a quiet chamber and invite two or three trusted companions. In movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, follow your own inclination without the slightest strain. Proceeding thus in practice, spirit accumulates to generate qi, qi accumulates to generate essence. With long accumulation, appetite gradually increases, the four limbs grow light and nimble, the cinnabar field warms, and external yang stirs of itself. From this single stillness, life’s mechanism stirs spontaneously—no artifice is involved, for the principle is inherently so. Like water stored long that breeds worms, the meaning is the same.

The above speaks fully of the method for men, women, and the aged in cultivation. Below reveals the essentials of mercury’s arising. The *Song of the Dao’s Spiritual Source* says:

*No need to debate tears,*
*Essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—*
*Tracing to the root and source, all are one.*
*This substance has no fixed place,*
*Transforming with the moment.*
*Stirred by the heart’s intent,*
*In the body, when heat is felt, it becomes sweat;*
*In the eyes, when sorrow is felt, it becomes tears;*
*In the kidneys, when desire is felt, it becomes essence;*
*In the nose, when wind is felt, it becomes mucus.*
*Flowing and circulating throughout the body,*
*In the end, it never departs from spirit-water.*
*Spirit-water is hard to describe—those who recognize it are few.*
*The sustenance of life depends on true qi.*

All ordinary people, when they sleep deeply at night, also experience yang arising. Not knowing how to gather it, they sadly let it slip by. The *Pointed Essentials* says: *"Yang essence arises daily, yet people do not know how to gather and collect it. Scattered throughout the body, it transforms into postnatal mercury."* Thus, all day long, in all that one does, it is mercury at work. When mercury wanes at night, one inevitably sinks into dull, heavy sleep. With age, the sea of qi dries up, and the tidal signs cease—this is mercury’s failure to flow and moisten, essence-water exhausted. The essence-path closes, the eyes grow dim, the ears turn deaf. Hence it is said: *"The hundred clans use it daily yet do not know."*

Thus, they know not that the mercury is spent. To keep cinnabar-mercury ever present, one must obtain watery lead to restrain it. The *Awakening to Reality* says: *"One must seek to subdue and find the Golden Duke."* The *Kinship of the Three* says: *"The flowing pearl of Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man; only when it obtains golden radiance does it turn and abide."* It further states: *"The maiden of the River, numinous and most divine—when one wishes to restrain her, yellow sprout becomes the root."* "Flowing pearl" and "maiden" both refer to true mercury; "golden radiance" and "yellow sprout" both refer to true lead. The alchemical classics say: *"Life has no foundation without nature; nature cannot endure without life"*—this is the meaning. Hence it is said: *"Refine essence to transform qi; refine qi to transform spirit."* Spirit is mercury, while qi is lead—is this not lead’s power to generate mercury? The *Pointed Essentials* says: *"People see gold born of the moon yet do not know the moon’s light originally issues from the sun—is this not mercury’s power to generate lead as well?"* Lead and mercury generate each other; wind and fire refine them in alternation. When refining reaches the point where lead is exhausted and mercury dried, this is the Golden Elixir. Thus, the tortoise obtains the night-shining pearl and can shed its shell; the dragon obtains the fire-repelling pearl and can soar aloft; the serpent obtains the wind-stilling pearl and gains eternal life; the fox obtains the moon’s essence and can transform into a human. If even these strange creatures can achieve such things, how can man alone fail to obtain the Elixir? The principle is clear.

Now, the cosmos is one Great Ultimate, and each thing possesses a Great Ultimate. Taking the Great Ultimate of the human body as an example: man is a Great Ultimate. Lead and mercury are the yin and yang of this Great Ultimate, while the Mysterious Pass is the Ultimateless within the Great Ultimate. As for Fuxi’s *River Diagram* and the primordial state of mutual dependence...

The cultivation of Supreme Virtue may be learned. Supreme Virtue is the body of primordial purity. The *Luo River Writing* of Great Yu belongs to the postcelestial flow. The cultivation of Lesser Virtue may also be learned—Lesser Virtue is the body already broken. Though the methods of refining Supreme and Lesser Virtue differ, their ultimate achievement is one.

Now, true lead is the metal within water—one and four, Sun Wukong. True mercury is the wood within fire—two and three, Zhu Wuneng. The Mysterious Pass is true earth, residing at the center—generative number five, Sha Wujing. Are these not the three and five combining to form one Tang Sanzang? The white horse occupies its proper position within the body, its beauty inherent and flowing through the four limbs.

Those who read the *Four Journeys* yet comprehend the meaning of "Three Stores" shall find the Dao of the Golden Elixir effortlessly accomplished. The *Cantong Qi* states: "Three and five unite as one—the essence of Heaven and Earth. This may be transmitted orally, yet defies written conveyance." It is like crossing a river by boat or catching fish with a net: without a boat, how can one cross? Without a net, how can one catch fish? Without method, how can one cultivate the Dao? Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, true attainment cannot be forced by guesswork.

Here, I speak plainly for the sake of fellow seekers, that all may see with clarity. *Supplement, Chapter Two*

The two emerge from the same source, hence their differing names; the two enter into one root, sharing a common origin. Dongting says:

The virtue of the highest Dao is non-action, not sought through scrutiny. The highest virtue is the body of youthful purity, requiring no transmission from a master. Those who practice the learning of action need only cultivate the work of non-action. The virtue of the lower Dao is action, its function unceasing. The lower virtue is an already broken body, necessitating transmission from a master. Those who practice the learning of action must early engage in the work of grafting. For a broken body inevitably suffers loss—without a foundation for grafting, how can it be restored? Thus it is said: when qi decays and blood wanes, one should supplement and graft the Dao. The classic states: "Graft life according to the years, to become a guest of long life." The Buddhist scriptures say: "The old monk can graft the rootless tree and relight the lamp at the bottom of the oil-less sea." Lüzu says: "Conserve essence and graft life early—do not delay." The *Guizhi* states: "If one truly grafts it, one attains long life; if not, one dies prematurely."

Yet people today fail to understand the metaphor. Upon hearing of grafting, they immediately trust false masters, purchase the "cauldron of the female," and engage in disembodied qi-exchange, believing this to be the Dao. The *Cantong Qi* says: "Mixed natures are not of the same kind—how could they willingly unite in one body?"

My grafting speaks of that which emerges from within one’s own body—postnatal returning to prenatal, the true yin and true yang as two medicinal substances. This is the *Golden Elixir of Nine Returns and Seven Reversals* of which the alchemical texts speak. Thus, Ancestor Sanfeng said: "All dross and base matter are not of the same kind—only true yin and true yang are the proper graft." He also said: "In the intercourse of yin and yang, lead and mercury are the graft—know that one employs the lead and mercury of one’s own body. Never conjecture it to be upon the body of a woman." Lead and mercury are water and fire. One must clearly understand the root of water and fire, and then one will grasp the meaning of grafting.

The *Daodejing* says: "These two emerge together yet bear different names." Thus, the scriptures of the Three Teachings differ in name but share a single source. Hence the distinctions of lead and mercury, the divisions of water and fire—clever metaphors, established images, myriad appellations, a thousand names—yet none transcend yin and yang, all residing within one’s own body. Therefore it is said: "Even the foolish and ignorant, if they practice this, immediately ascend to the sacred realm."

Master Zi Qing said: "The root of nature, the stem of life."

"Emerging together yet bearing different names, divided into two categories yet united in one place to form the elixir, returning to the primordial. This is the qi of the primordial prior to heaven. The primordial prior to heaven is precisely the root of water and fire within the body—the supreme treasure of the White Tiger’s foremost classic.

Laozi said: 'There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; silent, empty, standing alone and unchanging.' Zhou Dunyi said: 'The true of the Limitless, the wondrous essence of the Two and Five conjoined and coagulated.' What are the Two and Five? The Two is the six-two residing within, the feminine yin of the hexagram. The Five is the nine-five residing without, the masculine yang of the hexagram. When inner and outer, male and female, yin and yang harmonize, they transform into the true unity of yang. This is what is meant by 'I excel at nourishing my vast and mighty qi.' When swallowed into the abdomen, it is said: 'With but a single grain of the knife entering the mouth, white wings sprout by day.'

For in heaven and earth, without rain, nothing is transformed. The *Yijing* says: 'Opposition gives rise to number.' Alas! When Qian and Kun unite, the myriad things flourish; when Kan and Li unite, the entire body flourishes. The secret of dual cultivation is fully revealed here—how could this not pertain to the Confucian teaching?

Further advancing the discussion: the water and fire of the sacred work of inversion are precisely what the *Yijing* refers to as 'the male submits below, the female above—thus is harmony achieved.' This fire is no ordinary fire; it arises from the water of Kan, sufficient to open and unblock the meridians—this is true yang. This water is no ordinary water; it arises from the fire of Li, sufficient to subdue and steam—this is true yin.

Master Cui said: 'True water, true fire.' He also said: 'The lead dragon ascends, the mercury tiger descends.' Ancestor Lü said: 'Qian’s lead, Kun’s mercury—the golden elixir’s ancestral dragon. Lead and mercury, tiger and dragon, are most numinous.' Ancestor Sanfeng said: 'True water and fire pair yin and yang; let no one indulge in wild speculation. Though you sit in vain emptiness, you cannot escape death and burial in the northern hills. If you do not even know water and fire, what then?'"

"From what then is it grafted and joined?

The so-called true water and fire—fire within water that water cannot extinguish is called true fire; water within fire that fire cannot consume is called true water. These are none other than true yin and true yang.

If still unclear, observe the *Journey to the West*: the fire of Red Boy that the waters of the Four Seas’ Dragon Kings could not quench, and later, the fire of Fire-Cloud Tower that the waters of the Four Seas’ Dragon Kings could not suppress. Only the water of Guanyin of the Southern Sea could resolve the matter. Now, *nan* (south) is *Li*, fire; *hai* (sea) is water. Water within fire is the true water within the body. The fire of Red Boy and the fire of Fire-Cloud Tower are the true fire within the body.

Guanyin is the inner observation of signs and messages. When the sign arrives, water and fire naturally achieve harmony. Ancestor Lü said: 'Within this is true trust; when trust arrives, you will surely be startled.' Master Nihuan said: 'Essence arises at its appointed time; when the time comes, spirit knows.' Zhu Yuanyu said: 'When the season arrives, the medicine arises of itself.'

As I see it, the *Journey to the West*’s ginseng fruit tree is this very medicine. Grafting and joining the female crucible is of no use—there is no doubt of this. Yet to recognize the medicine but not know the timing of its gathering and the firing process is still in vain.

The most arcane secrets of the elixir texts lie in these three. Yet this is not the true secret. Within them are divisions and unions, inner and outer—truly difficult to express."

Let us now expound upon these divisions. "Gathering" refers to gathering the outer; "taking" refers to taking the inner. "Fire" is the fire of spirit; "timing" is the true breath. Combined, gathering and taking are precisely the fire and timing. Fire and timing are precisely gathering and taking. Thus it is said: fire and timing do not lie outside gathering and taking, and gathering and taking lie within fire and timing. When the moment arrives at the crucible, one cannot act of one’s own will—one must await the Yellow Dame’s ascent to the altar. Divisions and unions, inner and outer, all obey the Yellow Dame.

The scriptural command states: "The Yellow Dame is the commander of the Central Palace." It is also said: "When the infant boy and girl emerge together, they are drawn into the chamber by the Yellow Dame." Alas! The infant boy can ride the White Tiger, and the girl can mount the Green Dragon, yet the Yellow Dame need only lead them by the hand—such is the vastness of her spiritual power. The four symbols and five phases all rely upon the earth’s trustworthiness; this is no deception. One further realizes that the Yellow Dame can tame dragons and subdue tigers, that she can unite and harmonize all things. Not only this: in an instant, the Yellow Dame can divide midnight and noon without recourse to hexagrams; within the trigrams, she can stabilize the Qian and Kun. The entire process of the elixir Way is wholly governed by the Yellow Dame. For "yellow" is the color of the center, and "dame" signifies harmony. As the *Book of Changes* says...

The governing principle lies herein—thus, it cannot be separated from for even a moment. When one emerges from the womb into the Purple Clarity, the Venerable One says: *"Within the Mud-Pill Palace dwells the Yellow Dame."* In *Journey to the West*, whenever Sun Wukong engages in battle, he declares midair: *"Do you recognize your Grandfather Sun? Only the Yellow Dame discerns purity and impurity, knows the old from the young."* As for the Yellow Dame within humans, she is the true intent. Master Yin states: *"True intent is the Qian’s primordial essence."* From the oral instructions of Master Wu, one comes to know that the Yellow Dame is the original face before the body was born of father and mother. Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng says: *"The original face is ever manifest"*—this is to teach people to recognize the Yellow Dame. Should one ask, *"Can this manifestation be seen?"* The answer lies in the *Book of Changes*: *"Without thought, without action, still and unmoving—only when stirred does it penetrate."* At this moment, one first beholds the Yellow Dame.

As for the method of refining the medicine: when divided, one gathers true yang and true fire (the earth of *wu*); one collects true yin and true water (the earth of *ji*). When united, yin and yang harmonize, water and fire commingle, and *wu* and *ji* layer to form the *daogui*. Speaking of the medicine’s production: when divided, one must clearly distinguish *ren*-water from *gui*-water—*ren*-water is yang, *gui*-water is yin; *ren*-water is clear, *gui*-water is turbid. *Ren*-water is true lead, the external medicine, which comes from without, hence it is said: *"Lead must be sought externally."* *Gui*-water is true mercury, the internal medicine, which is possessed within oneself, hence it is said: *"Mercury is taken from within."* When united, they return to the furnace for refinement.

Speaking of fire: civil fire involves sealing, bathing, and cessation—gentle nurturing. Martial fire involves gathering the primordial qi, obtaining the true unity of lead, extracting the line within *kan*, seizing the tiger within water, plucking the white within black, and drawing the yang within yin. Speaking of the celestial cycle: the *Yin Fu Jing* states: *"The Dao of heaven and earth gradually arises like clouds, flowing as qi."* For when qi arrives, midnight comes. Then, one employs the civil fire to nurture.

This gradual transformation becomes martial fire—likened to the *Fu* hexagram of Winter Solstice, where one yang, rising from the earth’s depths, ascends to the celestial apex; hence it is called *"advancing yang fire"* or *"drying with nine nines"* (for nine is yang). Then, from martial fire, it slowly shifts into civil fire—likened to the Summer Solstice hexagram, where one yin descends from the celestial apex to the earth’s depths; hence it is called *"retreating yin tally"* or *"complying with six sixes"* (for six is yin). This is the *Fu* (Return). From this point, one who can wield the golden elixir—who would say it cannot succeed?

The oral formula states:
*"Thoughts do not arise, intent does not scatter,
Conceal your light, silently guard true breath,
Gently alternate civil and martial fires,
Naturally harmonizing with heaven’s measure—
Only then may it be called the celestial cycle of fire timing."*

Thus, the *Cantong Qi* employs the waxing and waning of the sixty-four hexagrams as a metaphor, the solar terms of a year as a metaphor, and the lunar phases of a month as a metaphor. Yet there are matters within it that words cannot exhaust—these the *Cantong Qi* has already detailed. Hence it is said: *"Without studying the* Cantong Qi*, how could one grasp the work of fire timing?"* For this reason, it stands as the sovereign of all ancient elixir classics.

In sum, though the principles discussed throughout may seem clear, know that they are all figurative speech. Beware of mistaking your own cleverness and thus leading yourself astray. As Master Ziyang said:
*"Words are established to clarify images;
Once the image is grasped, words are forgotten.
Images are set forth to point to meaning;
Once meaning is realized, images are discarded."*

Though the immortals’ teachings vary, every allegory conceals a true principle. One must grasp the image, forget the words; attain the meaning, discard the image. Never cling to images or fixate on texts.

Alas! May my fellow seekers steel their resolve, plunge their minds into the cavern of principle, and study diligently for years. When the true teacher appears, falsehood and authenticity will part, right and wrong will separate.

How could one let the truth slip away before one’s very eyes? Failing to awaken to the alchemical scriptures, blind to their figurative speech, one may pledge allegiance to King Wang at dawn and Lord Li by dusk—no wonder they mistake a deer for a horse, swap a sheep for an ox, now installing a maiden’s crucible, now purchasing a boy’s elixir. Instead of blaming their own confusion, they claim the immortals and buddhas instructed them—can such a thing be?

My heart cannot bear it, so I append this chapter to rescue them.

**Refuting Heterodoxy**

Heterodox arts and heretical sects stand like a forest of gates, beguiling the heart-mind—these must be refuted. Dongting said: “In this age, the true Dao lies buried while heterodox teachings swarm like wasps. Many lay practitioners of the Way, misled by side doors and crooked paths, remain deluded and unenlightened.”

Of late, I hear that within our Middle Kingdom, sectarian gates proliferate. Let me name a few: the Gate of Serenity, the Great Vehicle Gate, the Golden Elixir Gate, the Jasper Pool Gate, the Yao Gate, the One-Finger Gate, the Primordial Gate, the Great Wisdom Gate, the Gate of the Venerable Lord, and the Supreme Vehicle Gate—all manner of side doors, too numerous to list. Without exception, they teach people to abstain from meat and recite scriptures, calling it “cultivating good karma”; to refrain from killing and release living beings, calling it “accumulating merit.” They claim that by contemplating death, one will surely become an immortal or transcendent and ascend to the Jasper Pool, or become a buddha or patriarch and return to the Western Heaven. With such deceptions, they corrupt the heart-mind and debase customs. Heaven trembles in wrath—how could the authorities tolerate them?

Some lay preceptors, monks, and Daoist priests fabricate rituals and registers, performing exorcisms for the sick to avert stellar misfortune, or substituting for the elderly in *bai dou* rites to prolong life. Others hold memorial services for the dead to deliver their souls, or, when calamity strikes, conduct jiao rites to protect the locality. Yet these are all external paths—where is such magical power? In truth, they are but grand schemes to swindle wealth. Even the households of nobles and scholars are duped, passing these practices down as tradition without scrutiny. Are they truly unaware of the principles, or simply blind to the illusions?

Worse still, some lure people into leaving home, shaving their heads, and altering their attire to study monastic discipline, calling it “taking refuge in the Buddha.” They establish meditation groves, summoning monks from all directions to gather, using mugwort fire to cauterize the crown of the head, conducting *da qi* and *pao xiang* rituals, and bestowing ordination certificates, robes, and alms bowls.

These are called "precept-receiving monks." Some wait for old age and death, burning their bodies in fire, calling it "transformation through cremation to become a Buddha." Some present *gong'an* cases, investigate *huatou*, or sit in silent meditation with darkened minds—blind cultivation and reckless practice—calling it "spiritual training." Some engage in visualization and internal alchemy, swallowing saliva and drawing in *qi*, or maintaining stillness while observing the nose, calling it "studying the Dao." Some busily spend their days soliciting alms and merit, constructing temples and monasteries, yet in truth scheme for their own gain. Some absorb the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon, focusing their minds on immortality and agelessness. Some pace the *Big Dipper*, inscribe talismans, chant incantations, and capture demons and spirits, swindling others out of silver and money. Some work with the five metals and eight minerals, discussing furnace fires, refining cinnabar and gold, and deceiving others out of their capital. Some gather men and women at night, entering empty chambers, stripping naked, pressing navels together to merge *qi*, claiming it as "transmitting the Dao." Some use women as crucibles, extracting their first menses and red lead to congeal elixirs, hoping to ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Such are the manifold heretical arts.

Difficult as it is to enumerate all such unrighteous deeds, they truly violate heaven and harm principle, deluding the world and deceiving others. Even if you escape the net of the law, how can you evade the retribution of karma? Far better to reform, pursue honest work, and return to the true Dao—how joyful that would be! It is my hope that all good men and faithful women of the world will see through these deceptions, recognize their falsity, and thus avoid falling into such pits.

*Preface to the Annotated Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate*

The principle of the Supreme Ultimate is subtle indeed, wondrous indeed! It is utterly non-being yet contains utmost being; utterly empty yet contains utmost reality. Without form or image, it stands before heaven-and-earth, yet its substance manifests after heaven-and-earth—its function. It cannot be known through knowledge, nor grasped through recognition. To attempt to describe it is to miss it; to discuss it is to misrepresent it. The ancients, compelled to depict it, used the circle ○ to name it as the Dao, as emptiness, as non-being, as the primordial qi, as the Non-Ultimate, as the Supreme Ultimate. The Dao is the nameless name; emptiness and non-being are the Non-Ultimate. When speaking of the time before things arose, it is called the Supreme Ultimate and primordial qi. In truth, emptiness, non-being, qi, the Non-Ultimate, and the Supreme Ultimate are all one and the same thing—there are not two separate entities. In the *River Chart* and *Inscription of the Luo*, it is the central five’s center, the single point within. In the interplay of yin and yang, before and after heaven-and-earth, it is the single aperture. Alas, constrained by qi-endowment and obscured by human desire, people follow the yin qi of the posterior heaven, losing the luminous and unobscured root of their original nature. Adrift and forgetful, they fail to return—how lamentable!

I have long admired the Dao. In the winter of the *yiwei* year, I found myself in Hanyang, where I heard that Master Wang Dongting embodied the Dao. I took the disciple’s bow and inquired into the profound mysteries of the prior and posterior heavens. He graciously replied: "Fu Xi’s *River Chart* is empty at its center—this is the prior heaven. Laozi said, ‘Nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth’—this refers to the same thing, ○. The Confucians speak of the ‘centrality of the yellow center,’ the Buddhists of the ‘emptiness within emptiness,’ and the Daoists of the ‘center of the circle’—all point to the single point of numinous light where heaven and earth unite. Yu the Great’s *Inscription of the Luo* is replete at its center—this is the posterior heaven. Laozi said, ‘Named, it is the mother of the myriad things’—this refers to the same thing, ──. The Confucians speak of ‘essence and oneness,’ the Buddhists of ‘returning to the one,’ and the Daoists of ‘embracing the one’—all point to the single point of true qi where father and mother unite. Thus, the prior heaven’s nature and the posterior heaven’s life naturally align. ○ To seek dual cultivation, one must proceed likewise. The Confucians say ‘the one thread’—it threads this one through the center. The Buddhists say ‘returning to the one’—it returns this one to the center. The Daoists say ‘embracing the one’—it embraces this one within the center. Where there is a center, there must be a one; where there is a one, there must be a center. The center envelops the one; the one governs the center. This is nature not departing from life, life not departing from nature—nature and life merge to form this single thing ○. Every person possesses it fully; each is perfectly complete. The sage does not gain more; the commoner does not have less. Even the tiniest creatures—mosquitoes, fleas, lice—are no different. As Shaozi said, ‘Each thing has a Supreme Ultimate; each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate.’ So it is.

At birth, the single thing divides into two; upon breaking the body, the two further divide into three. Thus, the prior heaven becomes obscured, and the posterior heaven’s *kan*-water leaks downward."

Fire departs and flames upward; water and fire fail to harmonize, gradually leading to old age and death—all because one cannot find the old path of their origin. Consider, then, the beginning of the mundane: the way of husband and wife in mortal union. Externally, a matchmaker arranges the betrothal, and when the time comes, the bride is escorted into the bridal chamber. At the man’s first sight of her, his posterior-heaven heart and kidneys unite, and his outer yang stirs, instantly forming this single thing. He then deposits this thing into the woman, and in an instant, the woman conceives. This is the ordinary course of a woman marrying a man, proceeding in the natural order.

In the Dao of immortality, one inwardly illuminates the root of the self: the woman, too, possesses this single thing. When the time arrives, the infant appears, the prior-heaven heart and kidneys unite, and the outer yang stirs, instantly forming this single thing. The Yellow Dame is then summoned to escort it into the Chamber of Radiant Spring, where a thread of true qi from this thing is deposited into the woman. Within this thing, the man, too, instantly conceives. This is the inverse course of a man descending to the woman, cultivating in reverse.

In the end, though the paths of immortality and mortality differ in name, they are not two in substance—only the distinction between forward and reverse. As the poem in the *Essential Instructions* says:

*"He then took the woman,
awaiting the seduction of the gentleman who came from without.
As the* Heart-Matching Collection *says:
At the ninth hour, the man comes to lodge;
at sixteen, the fair maiden goes to prepare the bed.
The Yellow Dame brokers the match, pairing them as mates,
husband and wife loving each other like mandarin ducks,
tumbling phoenixes, their spirits entwined—
drunk and dazed, they revel in their union.
After the clamor, a single drop seals the primal aperture,
firmly secured, beyond all negotiation."*

From this point, the sacred embryo has taken form, with the True Essence of the Great One concealed within. As the *Finger-Pointing Collection* says: *"One’s own essence and blood conjoin in self-copulation—within the body, husband and wife: how wondrous!"* The *Great Achievement Collection* states: *"Within one’s own body lies husband and wife—telling this to worldly folk would truly make them laugh."*

In sum, though the heart-transmission of the thousand sages is one continuous thread, one must first clearly distinguish the body’s chart and its annotations to attain the deathless state. Knowing this, the elixir can surely be accomplished. I do not flatter my own preferences with grand words, nor do I exaggerate its power out of greed. Since my illness in the *dingchou* year, I have turned my heart to ashes, regarding high office as dust and gold and jade as mere pebbles—this has been so for nearly twenty years. What else could I seek?

Yet, considering that fellow seekers may not have met a teacher’s guidance, and that this matter is difficult to comprehend, I have specially entrusted it to the printers, that it may serve as the guiding principle for those who study the Dao. Thus, this preface.

Written in the first month of spring, the *bingchen* year of the Guangxu reign, by Zhao Baozhen of Yuzhang, styled Mukhan, at the Xichang Villa.

*Zhouzi’s* *Taiji Diagram*:
*"From Non-Ultimate comes the Great Ultimate."*

The Great Ultimate existed before the opening of heaven and earth. What form did it take before this opening? That is indeed unknowable. Yet if we infer from the Great Ultimate within the human body, it must have been the Great Ultimate. And before the Great Ultimate, there was the Non-Ultimate—even more unknowable. Confucius said, *"The Book of Changes* has the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes." He never spoke of the Non-Ultimate. Then what, after all, is the Non-Ultimate? The Great Ultimate within humans arises from the interaction of yin and yang. That which has not yet interacted but disperses within yin and yang is the Non-Ultimate. When heaven and earth were in primordial chaos, yin and yang undivided, how could there have been a Non-Ultimate dispersed within yin and yang, awaiting interaction? Yet if there is postnatal yin and yang, there must be prenatal yin and yang. After the opening of heaven and earth, postnatal yin and yang interact to form the Great Ultimate of things. Before the opening, prenatal yin and yang interact to form the Great Ultimate of heaven. Thus, when prenatal yin and yang have not yet interacted, their dispersion without order is the prenatal Non-Ultimate.

The term "Non-Ultimate" was doubted by Master Lu, but Master Zhu accepted and annotated it—though he did not elaborate on its principle. The Great Ultimate moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and stillness generates yin. When stillness reaches its limit, it moves again. Movement and stillness give rise to each other. What, then, is the Great Ultimate? It is the primordial chaos. Taking the Great Ultimate within the human body as an example: at the moment of the father’s begetting and the mother’s nurturing, a single point of luminous, radiant, and crimson light descends with the essence, becoming the root of the body. In heaven, it is called *ming* (destiny); in humans, it is called *xing* (nature). This is what is meant by "not departing from qi."

Those who cultivate the practice of stillness may perceive it in solitary sitting. As Su Dongpo’s poem says: *"In the middle of the night, a single point falls into the Yellow Court"*—this is a glimpse of it. Humans are born of heaven and earth, and the Great Ultimate of heaven and earth cannot differ from this.

The theory of movement and stillness here differs from that of Zhang Zai of the Han. Zhang Zai said, "Movement generates yin and yang." Here, it is said that movement generates yang and stillness generates yin. This is because there are two kinds of yin and yang: the yin and yang of correspondence, and the yin and yang of circulation. The yin and yang of correspondence arise from movement—just as humans give birth to sons and rear daughters, which cannot occur without movement. The yin and yang of circulation may arise from stillness or from movement. As movement and stillness alternate, yin and yang are inexhaustible—like the turning of the four seasons, where winter gives way to spring. The circulation of yin and yang is the ceaseless sincerity of which Master Zhou spoke, urging people to devote themselves to utmost sincerity.

That movement generates yang is easily understood; that stillness generates yin is harder to grasp. Here, I will elaborate on the generation of yin. Stillness is the state of profound obscurity. The profound obscurity of the primordial unity lies in the *xu* and *hai* conjunctions; that of the year lies in the *xu* and *hai* months; that of the month lies in the last five days; and that of the day lies in the last two hours. This is the natural Dao of heaven and earth. If one can align with it, moving without movement, then the mechanism of yang conceiving yin arises; stilling without stillness, then the function of yin activating yang emerges. Thus, it may also be said that movement generates yin and stillness generates yang—movement and stillness indeed give rise to each other, which is precisely Master Zhou’s teaching.

Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established. This division is the self-separation of yin and yang, not the splitting of the Great Ultimate into the Two Modes. Thus, though yin and yang divide, the Great Ultimate remains intact. If the Great Ultimate were transformed into yin and yang, the Great Ultimate would be destroyed—how then could heaven and earth endure?

Taking heaven and earth as an example: *qian* (heaven) above and *kun* (earth) below are separated and do not communicate. Taking the human body as an example: *li* (fire) symbolizes the heart, representing the middle daughter—yin. What the heart stores is *xing* (nature). *Kan* (water) symbolizes the kidneys, representing the middle son—yang. What the kidneys store is *ming* (destiny). As the ancients said: "Before a person is born..."

The unity of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (destiny) is the foundation of the undying body. Yet once emerging from the womb, *xing* no longer sees *ming*, and *ming* no longer sees *xing*. Thus, the ordinary fail to attain sageliness, and the division of yin and yang becomes like a husband and wife turning against each other—how could their household not collapse? From this, it is clear that the natural functions described below cannot be neglected.

Through the transformation of yang and the union of yin, the Five Phases—water, fire, wood, metal, and earth—are sequentially distributed, and the four seasons proceed. Examining the *Taiji* Diagram, I initially doubted its depiction of yin and yang. On the yang-movement side, two yang lines enclose one yin, forming the *li* trigram. In the *Yi*, *li* represents the middle daughter—yin—yet here it is treated as yang. On the yin-stillness side, two yin lines enclose one yang, forming the *kan* trigram. In the *Yi*, *kan* represents the middle son—yang—yet here it is treated as yin. Even Zhu Xi’s commentary states that fire is yang and water is yin. The *Taiji Diagram Explanation* aims to clarify the principles of the *Yi*. Confucius said, "Yang hexagrams contain more yin; yin hexagrams contain more yang." How then could one dare to overturn Confucius’ judgment in the *Appended Remarks*? One must understand that the transformation of yang and the union of yin require cultivation—unlike the union of man and woman, which is instinctive. Fire as yin and water as yang are merely conventional principles. Yet for those who master stillness, fire is no ordinary fire: it arises from *kan* water, sufficiently opening the meridians—this is true yang. Water is no ordinary water: it arises from *li* fire, sufficiently descending to subdue and steam—this is true yin.

Extending this: wood can generate fire, balancing fire to nourish wood, so that wood planted in fire does not scorch. Metal can generate water, refining water to form metal, so that metal submerged in water does not dissolve. Fire can generate earth, drying earth to cultivate fire, so that fire beneath earth does not extinguish. This is how the inversion of yin and yang in the sage’s alchemy of water and fire operates. Otherwise, if yin is fundamentally still, why would stillness not remain still? If yang is fundamentally active, why would movement not remain movement?

Regarding the Five Phases, it is said they are "sequentially distributed"—this refers to the natural order of the seasons. In heaven, they manifest as the primordial integrity of nature; in humans, they mark the natural beginning and end. Yet this is not the result of cultivation; the true work of cultivation lies in what follows. The Five Phases are one with yin and yang; yin and yang are one with the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate is fundamentally the Ultimateless. These two sentences reiterate the preceding discussion. At first glance, the inversion of the earlier text may seem insignificant, but its meaning runs deep.

To fail to recognize this is to overlook the work of returning from breadth to simplicity—what Confucius called "the one thread that runs through it all." All things under heaven, without exception, are encompassed by the Five Phases. Yet if one cannot bring them to completion, gathering the myriad affairs and things back into the Five Phases begins with the precision of investigation and understanding, followed by the subtlety of adaptation and transformation. However, if the Five Phases remain fixed in their respective positions, boundaries will forever divide them. Without mutual generation, insufficiency cannot be supplemented; without mutual restraint, excess cannot be curbed. Between heaven and earth, the vital impulse of life would inevitably stagnate. Thus, the Five Phases must be fused into yin and yang, so that what was divided gradually returns to unity.

Yet the *Yijing* states, "One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao," referring specifically to the human Dao. If humans fully unite with heaven, then the Great Ultimate *is* the Dao, and even yin and yang do not exhaust its subtlety. Therefore, yin and yang must be returned to the Great Ultimate. Herein lies the fulfillment of one’s nature and the establishment of one’s mandate. The worthy, drawing near to sagehood, might well pause here.

Alas! As the *Book of Songs* says, "The workings of high heaven bear no sound, no scent." The Great Ultimate, though formless, still retains a semblance of shape—this is not its ultimate truth. To clarify that the Great Ultimate is fundamentally the Ultimateless requires yet another layer of effort. Neither heaven and earth can confine it, nor ghosts and spirits fathom it. When dispersed, it leaves no trace; when gathered, it assumes no fixed form. Thus it has been since time immemorial.

To whom, if not Confucius, shall we turn? The Five Phases each possess their own nature, for the Great Ultimate gives rise to heaven and earth. Heaven and earth each possess a Great Ultimate of their own. Heaven and earth give rise to the Five Phases, and the Five Phases, too, each possess a Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimates of the Five Phases are not only identical to one another but also no different from the primordial Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate is the nature endowed by heaven’s mandate. As the *Book of Documents* says, "The August One bestows the center; there is a constant nature." The term "constant" makes clear that, though the myriad things proliferate in endless variety, their nature is no different. Here it is said that the Five Phases each possess their own nature—why? The Five Phases also possess the nature of *qi* and material form. Consider how the five flavors, when used in medicine, may be warming or cooling—this is proof that each possesses its own nature. Yet this is not the nature of heaven’s mandate. The true Ultimateless and the essence of the Two and Five coalesce and congeal. The preceding discussion of the Five Phases, each with its own nature, does not refer solely to the human body. With regard to the human body, the five viscera also correspond to the Five Phases, each possessing its own nature and its own Ultimateless. However, the Ultimateless of the postnatal is not the Ultimateless of the prenatal. The prenatal Ultimateless is that which, in the diagram, is appended to the Five Phases—water and fire. What, then, is the true? It is the luminous spark of spirit, bright and crimson, mentioned earlier. What is meant by the Two and Five? The Two is the second line, residing in the center of the inner trigram, the younger of the feminine. The Five is the fifth line, residing in the center of the outer trigram, the younger of the masculine. The hexagram pairs the Two and Five as mates—no more than this. The Qian Dao becomes male; the Kun Dao becomes female. Qian and Kun refer to father and mother; male and female, to their children. When the true Ultimateless of Qian arrives first and Kun responds, a male is formed. When Kun arrives first and Qian responds, a female is formed. Qian and Kun each possess the Ultimateless, each possess their own true, and whichever arrives first becomes the master, while the later cannot contend. The generation of heaven and earth through yin and yang follows the same pattern. The two *qi* interact and transform, giving rise to the myriad things. The myriad things, in their ceaseless generation, undergo endless transformation. Endless transformation is the ceaseless sincerity of the utmost truth. Only humans, receiving the finest essence, are most numinous. Once form is born, spirit awakens to knowing. The five natures are stirred, and good and evil diverge; the ten thousand affairs emerge.

The foregoing discussion pertains to the Dao of heaven, though many references are made to the human realm. For the Dao of heaven is difficult to grasp, and pointing to it through the human body is more intimate and accessible, allowing readers to comprehend it thoroughly. Here, however, we speak specifically of human affairs. What does it mean to be "finest and most numinous"? Among winged creatures, the virtue of fire from the south is received; among shelled creatures, the virtue of water from the north; among scaled creatures, the virtue of wood from the east; among furred creatures, the virtue of metal from the west. Only humans, the chief of creatures, receive the virtue of earth from the center—what Zuo Qiuming called "receiving the center of heaven and earth to come into being." Precisely because they receive the center, they partake of the *qi* of the sun, moon, and five planets, and no excellence is beyond their reach. Though sages and commoners differ, their numinosity is one. Form is *qi* and material; spirit is the mandate of heaven. The five natures encompass both the mandate of heaven and *qi*-material, and thus, when stirred, good and evil arise. If one acts without contrivance, like the Great Shun, who "followed the path of benevolence and rightness" rather than "practicing benevolence and rightness," then where there is no evil, there is good, and no trace is left. How could there be affairs? Yet the good and evil of worldly people are all intentional—this is meddlesomeness. Evil thus incurs guilt, while even good yields no merit. The emergence of the ten thousand affairs—even if one attends to each with care—leaves a hundred holes and a thousand gaps, ever difficult to mend. This is chasing the branches while forgetting the root, trying to stop boiling by skimming the pot—truly not as effective as removing the firewood from beneath.

The sage establishes the human standard through centrality, correctness, benevolence, and rightness, and takes quiescence as the foundation. Centrality and correctness are the Great Ultimate; benevolence and rightness are yin and yang. Taking the Great Ultimate as the essence and yin and yang as its function is the learning of clarifying essence and realizing function. The inner sage arises from this; the outer king, too, arises from this. One might think this leaves nothing to be desired, yet the sage does not rest content but must perfect the work of "taking quiescence as the foundation." The two characters "taking quiescence" were later, in Master Zhu’s *Changes*, replaced with "taking reverence." Those who venerate Master Zhu thus argue that quiescence is not as good as reverence. They do not understand that reverence arises from effort, while quiescence is natural. Quiescence is the vastness of heaven, effortlessly accomplishing transformation. Even this "taking unity, having no preferences" is forgotten in the merging of all. The sage, in his unfathomable numinosity, returns to centrality, correctness, benevolence, and rightness, entering the formless and leaving no trace. Is this the Ultimateless of humans? The Ultimateless of heaven? How could one fathom it? Thus, the sage’s virtue merges with heaven and earth, his clarity with the sun and moon, his order with the four seasons, his auspices and inauspices with ghosts and spirits. All these are without intention. Heaven and earth do not know their own virtue; the sun and moon do not know their own clarity; the four seasons do not know their own order; ghosts and spirits do not know their own auspices and inauspices. They follow the spontaneity of their nature without the slightest preconception. Only the sage grasps the entirety of principle, responding with effortless vastness. He never seeks to conform, yet the greatness of the two gates cannot exceed his scope. Once his essence is established, his function becomes numinous, without concern for this or anxiety over that.

The noble person cultivates it and meets with good fortune; the petty person defies it and meets with misfortune. Those who neither cultivate nor defy are sages; those who cultivate or defy are noble persons or petty persons. The sage, from the outset, harbors no notions of good or ill. Through broad learning, he returns to simplicity, perceiving the origin with clarity. He need not exert himself to cultivate, for there is nothing he does not cultivate; he need not forbid defiance, for there is nothing he defies. This is what is called "effortless action." The noble person, knowing full well that there is good to be attained, cultivates it as principle dictates, and though his achievement may vary in depth, all can bring blessing. The petty person, knowing full well that there is ill to be incurred, defiantly pursues it, driven by desire. Though his transgressions may differ in severity, all can invite calamity. Wherever the spirit reaches, heaven and earth respond. Openness and obstruction, long life and early death—all are thus determined.

Thus it is said: "The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of earth is established as softness and hardness; the Dao of humanity is established as benevolence and righteousness." This is the teaching of the *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes*. Yin and yang, hardness and softness, benevolence and righteousness—who does not know them? What is difficult is the establishment of their Dao.

To establish is to stand at their forefront, serene and unruffled, unattached to desire, and even unattached to principle. From this serenity and unruffled state arise yin and yang, hardness and softness, benevolence and righteousness. Born without exhaustion, they adapt to all circumstances—now yin, now yang; now hard, now soft; now benevolent, now righteous—vast as the deep spring, flowing forth in due season. Yet what is called the three Daos of heaven, earth, and humanity is but a division made by onlookers; in oneself, there is no room for such distinctions. Gathered, they reside in the single heart; released, they pervade the six directions. Holding fast to the standard of harmony, one accomplishes the work of positioning and nurturing. Who but one of abundant virtue could partake in this?

It is further said: "Trace beginnings to return to endings, and thus know the explanation of life and death." Where there is a beginning, there is an end; where there is life, there is death. Yet while life and death may be known, what precedes birth and what follows death remain unknowable. How, then, to observe them? Watch for the return, and when the first yang stirs, know that life begins; watch for the first yin to sprout, and know that death approaches. But it is not only this: life is the root of death—observe one’s conduct in life, and death may be known; death is the mechanism of life—observe the conditions of death, and life may be known.

Generally, at the moment of a person’s birth, each is endowed with a heavenly mandate. Qi is conjoined with mandate, and principle is conjoined with qi. By principle governing qi, essence is preserved; by qi strengthening principle, spirit is secured. Thus life is firmly established, and death, too, is but a form of life. For the common person, daily immersed in human desires, principle gradually fades away. Though their qi does not immediately dissipate, it lacks a master, and thus cannot endure long. Death is truly death, and life, too, is but a form of death.

There are, however, the clever ghosts of the literary, the mediocre ghosts who enjoy fortune, and the suffering ghosts who bear grievances—all with a single indomitable spirit unwilling to fade away. Yet they are but like lightning or the spark from flint, flickering between existence and non-existence, and even these cannot endure for centuries, let alone attain the lifespan of heaven and earth.

Reflecting on this, the three teachings are all called the Dao. Yet the talismans of the Daoists, the mantras of the Buddhists, and the poetry and prose of the Confucians—it is clear these are not their original intent. Even thousands of years ago, the Daoists, with deep roots and firm stems, guarded the center and embraced the One to preserve their nature through mandate. The Buddhists, through harmony and concentration, achieved decisive completion, preserving their mandate through nature. Confucius exhausted his nature to reach mandate, while Mencius cultivated his nature to establish mandate—both were practices of dual cultivation of nature and mandate, beneficial and without harm. Were they not thus clearly enlightened about the explanation of life and death?

Great indeed is the *Book of Changes*—this is its ultimate teaching.

Postscript.

Master Dongting, a native of Fenghu in Xiuning County, Anhui, was a man whose heart and conduct were ever inclined toward accumulating merit and piling up virtuous deeds, never once allowing worldly fame or wealth to weigh upon his mind. Upon his passing, such was his attainment.

His venerable father replied: Though the *Yin Fu Jing* and the *Dao De Jing* have been transmitted through the ages, their language is archaic and abstruse—scholars read them yet fail to comprehend. Later, when alchemical classics proliferated, half-concealing and half-revealing their meaning, scholars pondered them yet could not penetrate their depths. It is not that the Dao has ceased to function, but rather that the Dao itself has become obscured.

Thereupon, the Master, moved by great compassion, composed the *Essentials of Nature and Mandate*. When the work was completed, he showed it to me, and as I recited it, I found it to be nothing other than the great Dao of primordial qi, the learning of body, mind, nature, and mandate—wisdom that from ancient times sages, immortals, and buddhas have transmitted heart-to-heart and mouth-to-mouth as secret teachings. Here, every principle is laid bare without omission, truly the golden canon and jade precepts of the cosmos, a treasure of rare scripture between heaven and earth.

For the sincere gentleman who cultivates the truth and is destined to encounter this book, it will serve as a gateway to ascend the hall and enter the inner chamber. Following its methods and practicing them step by step, one will achieve layer upon layer of realization, witnessing verification at every stage. Only then will one know how lofty the Master’s Dao is, how profound his virtue. Thus, all scholars of later generations under heaven will be indebted to the Master’s grace.

Respectfully inscribed in the first winter month of the dinghai year of the Guangxu reign by your foolish nephew, Ke Zhaoping, with bowed head.
