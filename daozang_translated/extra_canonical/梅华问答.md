# 梅华问答

In the autumn of the *xinsi* year, on the full moon of the eighth month, guests Tao Jiruo and Han Dongran, accompanied by the monk Huiche, the Daoist Xu Donglei, five or six young scholars, and six or seven boys, gathered at the Bamboo Shadow Plum Blossom Hall to admire the osmanthus. At that time, paulownia leaves tapped against the window, osmanthus fragrance filled the tent, some played the zither and chanted freely, others composed poems by the stream. They burned incense, brewed tea, sat in silence, and conversed from the heart—joyful and harmonious, the whole hall in accord.

Jiruo sighed and said: "All people can become like Yao and Shun; with resolve, affairs will surely come to fruition—this saying is true. Yet why are those who cultivate the Dao as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain it as rare as dragon scales? Most fail to find the gate through which to enter. Heterodox paths and external teachings are not worth discussing, but what of the great Dao and its orthodox tradition—how should one proceed?"

Dongran replied: "The Dao of ancient and modern times is not two; the minds of sages and commoners are not separate. Though teachings are divided into the Three Teachings, their practice is one. The Dao is singular—this Dao is the true mechanism of heaven and earth, bestowed upon all things and manifest in all affairs. Yet people abandon what is near to seek what is distant, either dismissing it as lofty and wondrous or dismissing it as an old cliché. Even the few earnest seekers, lacking true transmission, degenerate into the strange and bizarre. If fortunate enough to meet a renowned teacher, they remain entangled in desires, procrastinating and neglectful—how can they hope for success? For now, let us set aside others and each turn inward to examine ourselves: can we advance with fierce courage and unite with the Dao? Yanzi said: ‘What sort of man was Shun? What sort of man am I?’ Those who would act must be thus."

Should one break the cauldrons and sink the boats, devoting three years of bitter toil—what then? As for the lineage’s core teaching: the elementary may be transmitted through words, but the profound must be grasped through the heart’s awakening.

I humbly submit that at the outset of practice, one must first examine principle. The *Great Learning*’s "investigating things" and "extending knowledge," along with the former Confucians’ "exhausting principle" and "presiding with reverence," are truly the secret keys to the gate of entry.

**Eulogy:**
Bamboo shadows and plum blossoms,
Lush radiance, pure light.
The sages’ hidden essentials—
Exhausting principle, presiding with reverence.
The true lineage of the Great Dao,
This is the correct decree.
Restraining the self and returning to ritual,
Follow the teachers Kong and Meng.

One asks: “When affairs arise and responses are required, we discern them by principle. But as for the Way of inner cultivation—how should one proceed? What method serves as the unifying grasp?” If learning lacks a guiding axis, it is like crossing a river without a boat or oars. One must first clarify the guiding axis before learning can begin.

Dongran replies: “Inner cultivation and external affairs share the same principle. The ancients said: ‘The heart must reside within the chest; thoughts must not stray from the gate of total grasp.’ The learner must first illuminate the original heart before gaining a guiding axis. Once the guiding axis is illuminated, the total grasp is already present! Thus, the books of principle study exist solely to expound the two characters *heart* and *nature*, serving as the gateway to virtue.”

The *Great Learning* opens by saying: “It lies in illuminating the luminous virtue.” When one illuminates this luminous virtue, learning gains its guiding axis!

**Eulogy:**
In illuminating luminous virtue,
A plumb line for learning.
Virtue is originally ours—
Its illumination demands effort.
Working diligently all day,
One reaches its ultimate.
When illumination can no longer be illuminated,
A single attainment is forever attained.

One asks: “The two characters *luminous virtue*—Master Zhu’s commentary states: ‘Luminous virtue is what one receives from Heaven, empty and numinous yet unfailingly bright, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs.’ Does this refer to the human *heart*? Or to *nature*?”

“Dongran said: ‘The *heart* and *nature* are originally inseparable. Speaking of its governing function, we call it *heart*; speaking of its possession of the principle of ceaseless generation, we call it *nature*. Only when the heart is capable can nature be seen; only through awakening can one speak again of the heart, with nature residing within. Illuminating the heart allows one to perceive nature; awakening to nature allows one to know the heart. Exhausting the heart enables one to know nature. Yet one must first know how to preserve the heart and nurture nature. Through long preservation and nurture, one grasps its principle; through vigilant introspection, one fathoms its essence. Proceeding thus in learning, one may then approximate correctness!’

**Eulogy:**
Preserve the heart, nurture nature—
Refining principle to its essence.
Introspect and master the self,
Object and self forgotten in equanimity.
Serene and profound, one awakens to numinous clarity.
When illumination yields no further gain,
There lies utmost sincerity.

If one asks: ‘The Four Books and Six Classics of the Confucians, along with the recorded sayings of former masters, all concern *nature-and-principle*. The inner scriptures of Buddhism likewise concern nothing but the *nature-school*. Why then does Daoism speak of *dual cultivation of nature and life*? Lü Zu said: *“To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost malady in spiritual practice. If one cultivates nature alone without refining the elixir, even after ten thousand kalpas the yin spirit will struggle to attain sagehood.”* He also said: *“Without life, nature cannot stand; without the original source, life cannot endure.”* Clearly, nature and life cannot be separated. Why then does Buddhism speak only of the *nature-school*, and Confucianism only of *nature-and-principle*?’

Dongran said: ‘Nature and life are originally inseparable. The *nature* spoken of in Buddhism refers to the *original true nature*. This *true* is the very source of nature and life—it is the *face before parents were born*, the *true of Non-Ultimate* as described in the *Taiji Tushuo*. The *nature* spoken of by people today, however, is *qi-quality nature*, the nature acquired after birth through the endowment of qi to form substance. Thus, wood has the nature of wood, metal the nature of metal, and water, fire, and earth likewise. Humans, as the most spiritually endowed of the ten thousand things, are likewise endowed within the five phases. This is what Master Zhu meant by *“qi forms the shape.”* What Lü Zu called the *“yin spirit after ten thousand kalpas”* refers to *qi-quality nature*, the spirit of discriminating knowledge. When Confucians speak of *nature-and-principle*, this principle resides within nature, present in all things at all times, serving as the mechanism of ceaseless generation and transformation, the inherent principle of the ten thousand things. Principle is nature, and nature is principle. Principle is one, while qi is two; qi possesses yin and yang, but principle remains singular and unified. When principle is illuminated, nature resides therein! The single point of the celestial endowment descends as the *zhong* (center), inherently possessing the mechanism of ceaseless generation, thereby manifesting the virtues of *health* and *compliance* within the Five Constants—this is called *nature*. Each person receives their allotted portion without deviation—this is called *principle*. The *original true nature* originates from the *true of Non-Ultimate*. Thus, to exhaustively investigate celestial principle and fulfill one’s nature is to encompass life within it. To cultivate nature is to cultivate life. As the ancients said: *“Cultivating one part of nature preserves one part of life.”* The discourse on *life-cultivation* is thus the profound teaching of Daoism!’

**Eulogy:**
Nature embodies ethical constants,
Life partakes in the transformations of creation.
Cultivating life through nature—
What worry of decay and renewal?
Hold fast with reverent vigilance,
No need to seek the imperial chariot.
Life cannot be known,
Nature admits no borrowing or pretense.

If one asks: ‘All human life arises from the endowment of qi to form substance—this is what is meant by *“qi forms the shape.”* The nature inherent within this form is entirely *qi-quality nature*. How then can the *original true nature* be clearly discerned? Moreover, the *face before parents were born* is merely thus. This state exists only prior to the formation of the physical body. After birth, once qi has formed the shape, how can one recover this *thusness* of nature? Unless this physical form perishes and returns to utter nothingness, how can one regain this *thusness*?’

Dongran said: ‘All human life is endowed with the nature of the Five Constants, each receiving a portion to become human. Thus, there are differences in strength, weakness, firmness, pliability, wisdom, foolishness, worthiness, and unworthiness. Yet the five natures of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth all reside within the *true nature*, and the essence of the *original true nature* is pure and refined, empty and luminous, serene and quiescent. The *qi-quality nature*, however, arises from qi forming the shape. After birth from parents, the physical form does not obstruct the empty and luminous—this is what is meant by *“empty and numinous yet unfailingly bright.”* The physical form is the physical form; the empty and luminous is the empty and luminous. The empty and luminous refers to the numinous awareness within the heart, which leaves no trace or form, existing only as luminous clarity within emptiness. This is what the *Yijing* describes as *“serene and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating.”* The physical form, however, is something tangible. Thus, the essence of the empty and luminous was originally *thus* before parents were born, and remains *thus* after birth from parents—hence, the physical form does not obstruct the empty and luminous. The so-called *qi-quality* arises because humans are formed by qi. The *Dynamic and Static* states: *“In responding to the myriad changes, not a single instance is free from the operation of discriminating knowledge. Once fallen into discriminating knowledge, the luminous essence of nature is obscured, like a mirror covered in dust or a spring muddied at its source. Following one mechanism with another, all is governed by the spirit of knowledge—this is the true nature obscured and transformed into qi-quality.”* Thus, it is called *qi-quality nature*. If one can empty the heart of all things, allowing not a single thought to arise, then the essence of nature becomes profoundly clear, serene yet ever luminous, responsive yet ever quiescent. This essence of nature is what Daoism calls *“perfect clarity,”* Buddhism calls *“perfect awakening,”* and Confucianism calls *“luminous virtue”* or *“utmost goodness.”’*”

When the bodily form perishes after death, the body dies yet the heart does not perish; the form vanishes yet the spirit does not vanish. What is called *“returning to utter nothingness”* refers only to the physical form. As for the heart-nature, it is originally without substance. If the heart clings to anything or becomes attached, how can it recover its original state of empty clarity, serene quiescence, and stillness?

What is meant by *“cultivation”* concerns both stillness and activity, ensuring that at all times one remains in constant awareness of perfect clarity and steadfast tranquility. Only thus can one align with the Dao in every circumstance, encounter its source from every direction, and thereafter return to life by reverting to the root.

Thus, the original true nature is fundamentally without location, without form or image, without color or appearance, without coming or going, without movement or stillness, without arising or ceasing. Its essence is emptiness and non-being, while its function is spirit and illumination. Even heaven and earth are but manifestations within this true nature!

People remain benighted because their hearts are unclear. If one clarifies the heart, one perceives the nature. When the heart is clear and the nature firm, one then knows that this nature never comes from anywhere nor goes anywhere—it has always been thus.

Scholars must have a point of awakening before they can personally practice and realize it. If one merely seeks words on paper or picks phrases from speech, I know they will never attain it!

A Eulogy:
Since it has no coming or going, how can there be death or life?
Deep as the abyss, clear as still water—ever luminous.
The beginning before all beginnings, the purity of Great Clarity.
It emits boundless light, primordial and harmonious, steadfast and true.

One asks: “If nature is said to have qi and substance, the distinction between its original state and its present form is clear! But if the heart does not recognize this, does it too have distinctions? How can one make it clear?”

Master Dongran replies: “The *Book of Documents* states: ‘The human heart and the Dao-heart.’ Master Yangming explained them as ‘mixed with human effort’ and ‘unmixed with human effort,’ which is most lucid. Now, the heart is not the fleshy organ within the body but the empty, numinous, and unwavering heart. As the master of the entire body, when the heavenly ruler is at peace, the hundred limbs follow its commands.

The human heart is the most numinous and lively of things. Whether one does good or evil, it is this heart; whether one becomes a sage, a worthy, an immortal, or a buddha, it is still this heart. As the ancients said:
*Three dots like stars arrayed,
A hook slanting like the crescent moon.
From this, fur and feathers emerge;
Buddhahood too depends on it.*
This speaks of the heart’s unfathomable constancy and change.

If thoughts arise and vanish, shift between good and evil, with countless fleeting notions in a single moment—chaotic and scattered—these are the deluded thoughts of the human heart. The human heart is human desire, the seed of samsara. If, when thoughts arise and cease, one can discern good from evil, examine right from wrong, and grasp them amid movement and stillness, distinguishing righteousness from profit—what accords with righteousness is the principle of Heaven, while what seeks profit is human desire. This principle of Heaven is the Dao-heart. To constantly preserve the principle of Heaven and eliminate human desire is the work of sages and worthies in restraining the self and returning to ritual.

If one further attains a heart empty and vast, unstained by a speck of dust, unburdened by a single thread, ever aware and ever illuminating—extinguishing only the moving heart while preserving the illuminating heart, maintaining constant clarity and vigilance, embodying the spirit’s resolve in action—this is the true practice of the Dao, the path to becoming a sage, a worthy, an immortal, or a buddha. Yet if one does not examine righteousness and profit, right and wrong amid affairs, but instead merely empties the heart and stills the nature, one falls into emptiness and quiescence, which neither Daoists nor Confucians accept.

There is also what is called the Heavenly Heart—the heart of Heaven and Earth, the root of the human heart and the Dao-heart. The heart is one; how can there be distinctions of Heaven, human, and Dao? The thoughts that arise in the minds of common people are nothing but selfish desires for profit, hence called the human heart. The thoughts that arise in the minds of worthies and noble persons are entirely upright principles and moral righteousness, hence called the Dao-heart. If one can have no heart of one’s own, no arising thoughts, but only perceive the flowing principle of Heaven, ever vigilant yet serene, merging with the heart of Heaven and Earth, taking the heart of Heaven, Earth, and all things as one’s own heart—this is called the Heavenly Heart. Yet the Heavenly Heart cannot be seen directly; it is revealed through people. When one is free from the obscuration of selfish desires, the empty and numinous heart, in every moment and place, manifests nothing but the heart of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: ‘In returning, one sees the heart of Heaven and Earth.’

The cultivator of the Dao sweeps away all obstacles—sounds, forms, wealth, and profit—nurturing an emptiness within like a bright mirror. When the yang energy returns at the moment of revival, the vital impulse stirs. What stirs is the manifestation of the Heavenly Heart. Only humans, with their intentional minds, create things and thus face birth and death; Heaven and Earth, with their unintentional transformation, endure forever. If humans too could be without mind, they would know Heaven and Earth!”

A Eulogy:
Heaven and humanity unite as one family, boundless as the vast sea.
The lotus in the pond, a rare blossom beyond the skies.
From nothingness, transformation unfolds; in being, marvels split like melons.
Beneath the midnight moon, a few plum blossoms.

One asks: “If the learning of nature and principle is thus, what is the purpose of Chan Buddhists’ seated meditation and investigating *huatou*? In the past, Master Lianchi of Yunqi expanded the Lotus Society, teaching people solely to recite the Buddha’s name. What is the essential meaning of these two practices?”

Master Huiyang replies: “Chan is concentration; investigating *huatou* is wisdom. For all people, whether cultivating or not, wisdom is foremost, knowledge secondary. Knowledge is the function of the discriminating spirit; with knowledge alone and no wisdom, one’s light is like a firefly’s—far from the radiance of sun and sky, incapable of great achievement. Only with wisdom can one investigate Chan and study the Dao, comprehending all scriptural meanings at a glance. In responding to all affairs and things, the true nature naturally flows forth, always in accord with principle—this is what is meant by possessing a unique eye.

The *huatou* is the gateway for beginners entering the Dao. Through a shout, a blow, a word, or a pause, the practitioner is struck into sudden awakening, instantly enlightened—this is called the Chan opportunity. *Opportunity* refers to the source of arising. It is meant to guide the practitioner to inwardly examine, silently observing the source of arising, thereby confirming the mind’s origin as the stepping stone to the Dao. Then the great Dao is effortlessly attained, naturally aligned.

This is the sudden method of Chan awakening to nature. For example, asking: *Who is reciting the Buddha’s name?* or *What is your original face?* Such phrases instruct the practitioner to hold fast to this one question, carefully investigating: *What is being investigated?* The aim is nothing other than to break through to one’s original face and recognize one’s true nature. When the practitioner silently investigates this *huatou*, thinking of nothing else, the mind ceases to move!”

When thought ceases even the absence of thought vanishes! At this moment of not a single thought arising, clarity and stillness prevail—yet one does not even know it as clarity or stillness. When the true mechanism stirs, sudden awakening occurs. In this instant of awakening, examine: *What is being awakened to?* *Who is the awakener?* Through such examination, one beholds the face before one’s birth—it has always been thus. This "who" is none other than one’s true awareness. If this mechanism is penetrated, immediate awakening occurs, called *breaking through the original inquiry*. Only by breaking through the original inquiry can one illuminate the nature-body; only by illuminating the nature-body does the path of cultivation begin.

As for sitting in inquiry, it is merely a method to stabilize the mind. In stabilization, wisdom naturally arises; sudden awakening occurs. Through awakening, clarity emerges, and one’s original true nature is thoroughly illuminated. This awakening and clarity cannot be attained without wisdom—this is the method of dual cultivation of stabilization and wisdom. Stabilization gives rise to wisdom; wisdom stabilizes itself. Practiced over time, great stabilization and great wisdom naturally arise, suddenly aligning with the unborn, never departing from this thusness. This is most essential.

As for a single staff blow or shout, though the practitioner may suddenly awaken and attain without thought, one must still sit in practice over time, refining it to perfection, before achieving great stabilization and great stillness. A single thought lasting ten thousand years—how many in ancient or modern times have truly attained this? Those who merely sit in meditation today, rigidly still, clinging to Chan stabilization as their practice, fixating on the word "stabilization" to extinguish thoughts, are worshipping a dead mechanism. As the ancient truth says: *"Though one passes through countless kalpas, it all ends in emptiness and annihilation."* Thus, Nanyue Mazu’s rebuke: *"Grinding a brick to make a mirror."*

In praise it is said: *Only when one awakens to "who" can one truly speak of awakening.*

Without a single thread clinging, its dwelling lies in profound obscurity.
Thus it is, thus it is—guard it in primordial simplicity.
Yet primordial simplicity is not simplicity:
it is the music of the celestial spheres.

One may ask: *"Then what of the principle of reciting the Buddha’s name? And do the six characters ‘Namo Amitābha Buddha’ hold a profound meaning?"*
Huìchè replied: *"The principle of reciting the Buddha’s name is the Buddha’s compassion, a specially opened expedient Dharma-gate to universally embrace beings of the three capacities. For those of superior wisdom, one may expound the nature of principle. For those of middling capacity, one imparts the scriptures, causing them to recite with the mouth and contemplate with the mind, seeking meaning through the text, entering through understanding and awakening—this is called the gradual method. The sudden method can ferry those of superior capacity, but not those below. The gradual method is for those of middling capacity. But what of the utterly dull-witted? Thus, this expedient Dharma-gate was opened. Moreover, those who fear difficulty and seek ease are many, so they are taught solely to recite the Buddha’s name. Simply uphold this Buddha-name, single-mindedly and without distraction. At the time of death, one will attain rebirth in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss. For the most difficult thing to control is the mind. Now, by fixing this single Buddha-name, holding fast to this one thought, only the thought of reciting the Buddha remains. All other miscellaneous thoughts find no gap to exploit, and naturally, the spirit’s light shines alone, the true mechanism reveals itself. Over time, when not a single thought arises, the numinous clarity shines forth alone. One spontaneously realizes there is no self, no others, no heaven and earth, no mountains and rivers, no sun and moon—only awareness, without any sense of ‘I.’ Only then can it be called reciting the Buddha’s name. Attaining the samādhi of Buddha-recitation, the Buddha’s light naturally descends and shines, making accomplishment easy. Formerly, Patriarch Lü and Shí Tiānjī recited the Buddha’s name, composing a verse:

*Reciting the Buddha with sincerity is the elixir,
A rosary of a hundred and eight beads turns in cycles.
Recitation opens the wondrous gate, connecting numinous wisdom,
Recitation knots the bodhi, transcending saint and mortal.
The mind of recitation does not follow flowing waters,
The heart of recitation ever dwells among white clouds.
When recitation perfects its benefit, it transcends birth and death,
This verse remains for your contemplation.*

Embody this practice, and it is the true essence of reciting the Buddha’s name. If one merely chatters with the mouth while the mind lacks stability, the Buddha-thought mingles with deluded thoughts, unable to attain purity and stillness, entangled and confused—ultimately, it is of no benefit. Though one may hold the Buddha’s name all day, it is no different from not reciting. To recite yet not recite is worse than not reciting at all. For this Dharma-gate does not discourse on mind-nature, nor investigate spirit and qi, nor inquire into life and destiny. Naturally, it forges into a single piece, congealing the empty and numinous, transforming through passage and preserving the spirit. Swiftly ascending the lotus realm, it is most easy, most simple. Gain an inch, accumulate an inch—there is no fear of not succeeding, only of lacking constancy! With constancy comes sincerity, with sincerity comes single-mindedness, and one naturally attains the samādhi of Buddha-recitation.

The Buddha is awakening. Recitation means to hold in thought—it is not merely chanting with the mouth. The Dharma-gate of reciting the Buddha’s name is also called ‘cultivating the Pure Land.’ Pure is true purity. Land is earth. Earth occupies the center, referring to the human central palace. All thoughts and considerations arise from this central palace. Once a thought arises, this center is no longer pure! Thus, reciting the Buddha is to purify the mind. The Pure Land is true purity within. When the mind is without a speck of dust or shadow, great awakening manifests before one, and the Buddha and the self are of one body!

As for the meaning of the six characters, it does not depart from the wondrous metaphor of the original true nature. The ‘Namo’ (南無) means: ‘South’ is the southern direction, corresponding to fire in the five phases, and in humans, it is the heart. Within the heart, there is only spirit-consciousness—thus, there is no Buddha in the south. This points to the heart’s non-Buddha nature. ‘A’ (阿) means boundless. ‘Mi’ (彌) means pervading. ‘Tā’ (陀) is round and radiant, luminous—this points to the form and image of the original true nature, its light being the wondrous luminous awareness of the self. ‘Recitation’ means to constantly bear in mind, not forgetting. It is to illuminate the falsity of deluded thoughts, which are not the Buddha, nor the self’s numinous awareness. Only then is it the true nature, boundless and infinite, pervading the six directions, its form round and luminous, its light shining brilliantly, vast enough to embrace heaven and earth, its substance entering into emptiness. The Buddha is the self, the self is the Buddha. In life, it is thus; in death, it is thus. In life, it does not increase; in death, it does not decrease. In life, nothing was brought; in death, nothing is taken away. The ultimate is to be without birth and death, without coming and going. Thus, the *Heart Sutra* says: ‘No birth, no extinction, no defilement, no purity, no increase, no decrease.’ It all hinges on the distinction between awakening and delusion, the two words ‘confusion’ and ‘enlightenment’! To constantly abide in this great awakening is the Buddha-recitation of those of superior wisdom. If one merely upholds the name without awakening to the great root, it is the practice of the dull-witted. How can they be spoken of in the same breath?

Sitting in meditation and investigating Chan is the sudden teaching, a Dharma-gate of one awakening and a hundred penetrations. This was initiated by Bodhidharma because later students in the Middle Land did not understand mind-nature, did not awaken to the Buddha’s intent, clinging to words and fixating on meaning, with no prospect of thorough awakening. Thus, this Dharma-gate was established, not relying on written words, enabling one to see the nature in an instant—it was an expedient measure of necessity. An ancient worthy said: ‘With Chan but no Pure Land, nine out of ten go astray. When the karmic realm appears, suddenly one follows it away. With Chan and Pure Land together, it is like a tiger with horns—now a teacher of humans, in the future a Buddha-ancestor.’ Practitioners who rely on this will have no fear of not attaining the Dao!"

Dòngléi heard this and laughed, saying: *"What you have said can be called great awakening and great enlightenment! But what is the joy in the Land of Ultimate Bliss?"*

Without laboring a finger to reach the Western Paradise—yet where lies the Western Paradise? One says: *"To be born is to be born indeed; to go is not truly to go. Can you turn this phrase for me?"* All that has been spoken belongs to this shore—do you yet know there is that shore? What then is meant by "the other shore"?

The matters beneath the monastic robe are clear, yet those beneath the skirt remain unresolved. Do you know that *"the crimson sun suffuses the earth, yet beneath the sea no flowers bloom"*? Huìchè fell silent, staring blankly.

Dòngléi said: *"Of old, the Venerable Master of Pílíng had awakened to the well-sweep, yet still spoke of no life—why then did he go forth to seek the Dao, and why did the Master of Stone Apricot Grove grasp the staff of pulseweed? The Sixth Patriarch Huìnéng had already declared, ‘Bodhi is originally no tree, the bright mirror is also no stand’—what Dao did he transmit at the third watch? Have you not read in the *Platform Sutra*: ‘Sentient beings sow the seed, from the ground the fruit arises. The insentient has no seed, no nature and no birth’? Your school speaks of no-birth; my school speaks of long life. What is that which is both no and long?*

*The great virtue of heaven and earth is called birth. Yet heaven and earth are but one great mass within creation! To position heaven and earth and nurture the myriad things—this is the great virtue of creation. Great creation, great transformation—there is no moment it does not give birth. It is not that creation gives birth to the myriad things, but that the myriad things self-create and self-transform. Within this, there must abide a master of creation! Your school’s no-birth does not exclusively refer to quiescence. Only by being perpetually no can there be perpetual birth. My school’s long life precisely speaks of this perpetual birth. If one can realize the impermanent, then one may ride alongside the master of creation! As you have spoken, it cannot yet be called the ultimate principle.*

*Though the Śākya school does not speak of destiny, destiny is contained within it—yet even this character of ‘nature’ must not be spoken, for there is that which transcends both nature and destiny! In birth there is no birth; in death there is no death—who on the lotus dais of Ultimate Bliss has awakened to this?"*

**Eulogy:**
*To be born is to be born indeed; to go is not truly to go.*
*Without Buddha, where is birth? With superiority, who goes?*
*Since there is no no, its wonder is everlasting.*
*Joy without joy—there is the great compassionate ferry.*

*"Having heard the teaching of the Nature School, may I now hear the doctrine of the Destiny School? What is meant by the ‘golden elixir’?"*

Dòngléi said: *"Inquiring into high antiquity, there were no teachings of dragon-tiger, lead-mercury, or golden elixir. Only after Wèi Bóyáng composed the *Triplex Unity* and Zhāng Píngshū wrote the *Awakening to Reality* did the names of dragon-tiger, lead-mercury, and golden elixir begin to flourish in the world. From this, books on the golden elixir and destiny cultivation proliferated like ox-hides, yet truth and falsehood could not be distinguished, and heterodox teachings spread!*

*What is called destiny is the root of qi. All human life depends on qi; with qi there is life, without qi there is death—thus, death is called ‘the severing of qi.’ When qi is cut off, destiny is extinguished. Yet the root of human destiny is the primordial ancestral qi, which, after the form is bestowed, gives rise to postnatal breathing. This ancestral qi is the single point ● received from heaven at the moment of parents’ union. The essence of the Two and the Five wondrously conjoins and coagulates to form a person. Without this single point ●, the embryo cannot form, for the Two and Five have not yet united and coagulated. This single point is the principle that humans receive from heaven—what Master Zhōu called the ‘Great Ultimate.’ With this single point, the embryo independently establishes the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate then divides into yin and yang. Yin and yang transform and give rise to the Five Phases, which in the womb self-generate, self-grow, self-move, and self-transform, becoming postnatal qi. At this time, within the mother’s womb, it relies on the mother’s breathing for its own breath, and its qi enters and exits through the navel. When the ten months are complete and the child is born, the umbilical cord is cut—this qi can no longer enter and exit, and so must come and go through the mouth and nose: this is what is called postnatal qi.*

*The primordial ancestral qi hides within the ancestral palace, daily transforming into the postnatal, hence the distinction between pre-heaven ‘qi’ and post-heaven ‘qi.’ The pre-heaven qi is concealed within the ancestral palace and cannot be seen; the post-heaven qi enters and exits through the mouth and nose, and thus can be seen. Yet where is this ancestral palace? It lies below the heart and above the kidneys, before the spine and behind the navel—a suspended cavity in the center. This is the place where all people receive their life and destiny, also called the ancestral aperture. This pre-heaven qi is what is called destiny. With this ancestral aperture, there is destiny; without it, there is no destiny! Though this ancestral aperture independently establishes the Great Ultimate within the human body, its qi still communicates with heaven and earth. If the seven apertures are closed, it is cut off from heaven and earth, and the person dies! Thus, those who cultivate destiny cultivate this ancestral aperture. Such is the teaching of destiny.*

*What is called the golden elixir is gold as gold, elixir as elixir—their union is the meaning. When the golden elixir is accomplished, one returns to the Great Ultimate! When a person is born, they receive from heaven a single point ● to descend and be born, thereby establishing the Great Ultimate. This small Great Ultimate divided from the great Great Ultimate is what is meant by ‘each thing has its own Great Ultimate.’ When the golden elixir is accomplished, one returns to this great Great Ultimate. Thus, the great Dao of the golden elixir cannot be spoken of lightly."*

**Eulogy:**
*One yin, one yang—participating in heaven, matching earth.*
*The Five Phases are not metal; thus is the returning elixir.*
*Three and two become one; the Great Ultimate has no beginning.*
*How can there be no beginning?*

Knocking upon my door, Li Er. Hui Che heard this and started up in alarm, then fell silent in sudden realization. Bowing his head twice in reverence, he said: "Though this humble monk is dull-witted, may I follow these words?" Dong Lei replied: "The Most High saves all beings, for the Dao of Heaven cherishes life—this practice is open to all, how much more to you? Even the simplest man or woman, if they cultivate it, may at once enter the sacred realm of the navel. It depends only on the resolve they establish!"

**Eulogy:**
*Village after village blooms with fragrant flowers,*
*Tree after tree droops with willow branches.*
*Where is the bright moon?*
*The green calyx becomes the Dao’s altar.*
*Unswerving unto death,*
*One roams the imperial homeland.*
*The Great One gazes down,*
*Nine refinements forge unyielding strength.*

Hui Che said: "I wish to hear the details." Dong Lei replied: "The meaning of the golden elixir is also conveyed through analogy. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *'The original true nature is the golden elixir; the Four Great serve as the furnace, provisionally forming the pellet.'* The 'gold' here symbolizes that which remains unbroken through ten thousand kalpas. The 'elixir' signifies perfection without lack. This gold is not the metal of Earth Four among the Five Phases, but rather the Water of Heaven One, which precedes the Five Phases as the primordial. As for the metal of Earth Four, it falls within the Five Phases and belongs to the postnatal. The primordial gold is purely a stream of empty, formless primordial *qi*, existing within the Ultimate of Non-being—it is the flowing of the Great Ultimate. Once the Great Ultimate divides, it first generates the Water of Heaven One, then the Fire of Earth Two, next the Wood of Heaven Three, then the Metal of Earth Four, and finally the Earth of Heaven Five. This 'Heaven' and 'Earth' are none other than yin and yang.

The Water of Heaven One resides in the north, its number is one, and in humans it corresponds to *jing*. The Fire of Earth Two resides in the south, its number is two, and in humans it corresponds to *shen*. The Wood of Heaven Three resides in the east, its number is three, and in humans it corresponds to *hun*. The Metal of Earth Four resides in the west, its number is four, and in humans it corresponds to *po*. The Earth of Heaven Five resides in the center, its number is five, and in humans it corresponds to *yi*—these are the generating numbers of the *River Chart*.

Among the Five Phases, Earth is the most noble, which is why each of the four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—has eighteen days when Earth reigns supreme. For Water is restrained by Earth, Fire is quelled by Earth, Metal is generated by Earth, and Wood is planted by Earth. Moreover, Earth resides within Water, Fire, Metal, and Wood. Thus, Heaven One generates Water, which is completed by Earth Six; Earth Two governs Fire, which is completed by Heaven Seven; Heaven Three generates Wood, which is completed by Earth Eight; Earth Four generates Metal, which is completed by Heaven Nine; and Heaven Five generates Earth, which is completed by Earth Ten. These are the completing numbers of the *River Chart*. Therefore, one, two, three, four, and five are the generating numbers, while six, seven, eight, nine, and ten are the completing numbers. The numbers of Heaven total five, and the numbers of Earth total five—these five positions interact and each has its counterpart. The numbers of Heaven sum to twenty-five, and the numbers of Earth sum to thirty, making a total of fifty-five for Heaven and Earth. Thus, one and six reside in the north, two and seven in the south, three and eight in the east, four and nine in the west, and five and ten in the center—this is how the *River Chart* represents the generating and completing numbers of the Five Phases. Its form is round, its body empty and without substance, belonging to the primordial.

After the Great Ultimate divides, it separates into yin and yang, and yin and yang transform to generate the Five Phases. Yin and yang are Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth each generate and complete in turn, mutually serving as root, thereby embodying the image of the *River Chart*. To refine the golden elixir, one must gather the primordial *qi* of the One as the mother of the golden elixir. This primordial *qi* is called 'gold.' Yet the Ultimate of Non-being and the Great Ultimate—though each thing has its own Great Ultimate—are ultimately one. For the One root divides into the myriad things, and the myriad things all possess the One root.

The human body is a Heaven and Earth in miniature. As Heaven and Earth are, so too is the human body. Human life begins from a single point within the Great Ultimate. Now, one returns to that same point within the Great Ultimate. Cultivating in reverse is what is called the Way of Return, also known as the Great Golden Elixir of Nine Returns and Seven Reversions. This is the heart’s essence of the Most High, the supreme secret of the highest vehicle. Here, *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) are not divided but cultivated as one. For the single point of *xing* bestowed by Heaven resides here, and *ming* also resides here. Thus, cultivating *xing* is cultivating *ming*—this is the true learning of fully realizing *xing* and fulfilling *ming*. The other three vehicles—upper, middle, and lower—each have their own methods, but they divide *xing* and *ming* into two, and are merely side paths and winding trails."

**Eulogy:**
*Fully realizing nature and fulfilling life—*
*This is the foundation of all learning.*

Only our Mount Ni, seen in analogy like a dragon—
Paper curtains, no one within, yet at night the Yellow Bell roars.
Wrapped in rosy silk, plucking lotus blossoms in abundance.
One asks: “The alchemical texts say, ‘In cultivating the Dao, nothing is more precious than essence, qi, and spirit.’ The *Heart Seal Scripture* states, ‘The three supreme medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.’ Now, hearing this teaching, are essence, qi, and spirit to be deemed useless? Moreover, the original true nature—superior scholars may awaken to it, but how can middling and lesser scholars easily comprehend it? Heaven-bestowed life, once born, conceals itself in the ancestral palace, daily transforming into the postnatal to sustain human use. If one seeks it now, how can it be obtained?”

Donglei replies: “Nature and life are humanity’s root. Essence, qi, and spirit are humanity’s great functions. These three treasures of the human body are most precious, yet there is also a distinction of priority. Prenatal essence is the water born of Heaven’s One, existing in principle but without form, inherent within qi, pervading the entire body. Each time the hour of *hai* or *zi* arrives, yang revives and generates it—this is called primordial essence. If a single thought stirs, it immediately transforms into postnatal, tangible matter. Prenatal qi is the ancestral qi of the central palace, called primordial qi. Daily, it transforms into postnatal constructive and defensive qi circulating through the hundred vessels—it is not merely the qi of breathing. Prenatal spirit is the numinous clarity within the heart, called primordial spirit. Once it engages with knowledge, it changes into the postnatal spirit of discursive thought.

Thus, in cultivating the Dao, one relies on the postnatal to return to the prenatal, valuing the prenatal and not the postnatal. Worldly people, unaware of this principle, mistakenly regard postnatal essence and qi as supreme treasures. Day after day, they toil in the arena of fame and profit, with the seven emotions and six desires fanned within, and the allure of sound, beauty, wealth, and gain enticing without. Their hearts know not a moment’s tranquility. If even the postnatal is difficult to preserve, how can one speak of the prenatal?

As the Perfected One of Purple Yang once said:
‘Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a true teacher, do not force conjecture.’
Thus, scholars must seek the oral instructions of a true teacher before they may proceed. Yet one fears that heterodox paths and external teachings will bewilder the world, and scholars, lacking the single eye, how shall they discern whether a teacher is upright or deviant?”

**Eulogy:**
No thought, no worry—
Follow and yield to nature.

Without reliance on form or appearance,
One recognizes the prenatal.
In the quiet of night, the heart is empty,
At such times, the five strings are absent.
Cool as a jade flask,
Upheld by iron shoulders.

Should one ask, *"How then may one properly take a teacher? By what means can orthodoxy and heterodoxy be discerned?"*
Master Donglei replies:
*"To distinguish a teacher, first observe their conduct—conduct is the substance of affairs. Next, listen to their words—words are the traces of the heart. Often, words exceed conduct, and conduct disregards words. One must carefully examine whether their words and deeds align with sincerity. Only then may they be taken as a teacher. The Master said: ‘Hear their words and observe their conduct.’ He also said: ‘One who reviews the old to know the new may be a teacher!’ Long ago, Master Wang Kunyang declared: ‘If a disciple lacks a true heart for transcending the world, their wisdom-nature is obscured. Even if they encounter a true teacher, spirits will prevent them from seeing, veiling their wisdom-nature. Even if they see, they will not recognize the teacher as genuine. But if their heart is truly earnest and they diligently seek a teacher, Heaven will not fail them—the true teacher will come of their own accord.’"*

**Eulogy:**
A true heart sees truth,
A dust-laden heart sees dust.

As that bow drawn taut, verdant as spring,
Once were reeds and slips, where creation drew near.
Not-seeking in seeking—such seeking is divine.

One asked: *"I have heard that in refining the elixir there are three essentials. May I ask what these three are?"*
Donglei replied: *"The three essentials are the furnace and cauldron, the medicinal substances, and the firing times. The furnace is the vessel for applying fire. The cauldron is the container for storing the medicine. The medicinal substances are one’s own primordial True Unity qi, augmented by essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent. The primordial Unity qi serves as the mother of the golden elixir, enabling it to surge through the Three Passes and circulate through the body’s blood and vessels. Daily, one gathers this qi as the medicinal substance, converging essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent within the Central Palace, returning them to the furnace and cauldron to be sealed. Refine it day by day, so that the primordial essence does not transform into postnatal, tangible essence, but instead transmutes into qi; the qi within spirit transmutes into spirit; the spirit within the heart transmutes into emptiness—this is called ‘cooking and refining.’ Within this process, the firing times reside! Fire refers to the application of fire. Times refer to the timing. It is like cooking rice: if one applies fire without regard to timing, the rice will either remain uncooked or burn to charcoal. Thus, timing is essential—waiting for the precise moment. These three are the utmost essentials in elixir refinement, hence they are called the Three Essentials."*

**Eulogy:**
Postnatal and primordial,
Gather and revolve leftward.

The marvelous cannot be sought on its own; all day long, one must act with diligence. Neither exceed nor fall short—once stabilized and focused, it is like the sun rising, like the moon waxing full.

One asks: *"What is meant by the so-called Three Treasures?"*
Donglei replies: *"The Three Treasures have two names, inner and outer. The inner Three Treasures are essence, qi, and spirit. The outer Three Treasures are the ears, eyes, and mouth. All living beings depend on these essence, qi, and spirit. With essence, one can transform qi; with qi, one can transform spirit. When spirit flourishes, qi flourishes; when qi flourishes, essence is abundant; when essence is abundant, spirit becomes even more so! With robust essence and spirit, one enjoys health and longevity, and illness finds no foothold. When essence and spirit weaken, one easily succumbs to wind and cold. If one fails to guard and nurture them, illness soon arrives—hence they are called the inner Three Treasures. Lü Zu said: ‘When the elixir field holds treasure, cease seeking the Dao; when facing circumstances without attachment, do not ask of Chan.’ Among these three, preserving essence is foremost. The *Huangting Jing* states: ‘Immortals and Daoists are not inherently divine; they accumulate essence and amass qi to attain the real.’ Thus, when essence is depleted, spirit and qi are also depleted. In youth, though essence may leak, spirit and qi remain vigorous, and one does not feel weakness. But for the elderly or those with depleted original vitality, by forty or fifty, even slight leakage leaves one feeling spirit-fatigued and qi-weak the next day—this is the proof. However, the Three Treasures employed in profound practice are the Three Origins, not the postnatal essence, qi, and spirit. Nevertheless, to seek the primordial, one must search within the postnatal. If one abandons the postnatal to seek the primordial, where can it be found? The outer Three Treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—are where spirit leaks through the eyes, essence through the ears, and qi through the mouth. When the eyes do not see, the hun resides in the lungs; when the nose does not smell, the po resides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, essence resides in the kidneys; when the four great are unmoving, intent resides in the spleen—this is called harmonizing the Four Images. Long ago, the Jade Maiden of the Nine Heavens appeared in a dream to my friend, saying: ‘The outer Three Treasures should be inwardly concealed; the inner Three Treasures should be sparingly guarded—this is the utmost essential for entering the gate.’ The *Cantong Qi* states: ‘The Three Treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—should be closed and not opened. The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and guarding the center of the compass.’ Thus, these Three Treasures are the utmost essentials in cultivating the Dao."*

**Eulogy:**
Inner and outer Three Treasures,
Subtle and worthy of exploration.
Guard them within the compass’s center,
Harmonize them to nurture vastness.
From the postnatal return to the primordial—
This is the supreme Dao.
A bowl of jade nectar,
Pounded by the frostless hare.

One asks: *"The meaning of the furnace and cauldron has already been explained in detail, but I still seek further clarification of its subtleties."*
Donglei replies: *"The furnace and cauldron are none other than the Central Palace’s Yellow Court and qi cavity. Yellow is the true color of the center. Court refers to the central hall of a chamber; in the human body, it is located between the heart and kidneys. The qi cavity lies within the navel wheel, so the Yellow Court is the cauldron, and the qi cavity is the furnace. Shi Jianwu said: ‘Before it faces the navel gate, behind it faces the kidneys; between them lies a true golden cauldron.’ Probing its subtle meaning, the Yellow Court resides within the qi cavity—it is not the Yellow Court point below the heart. For the human body’s mud pill connects directly to the bubbling spring, and the hollow passage between them is the Yellow Path. Taking above and below as furnace and cauldron is also acceptable. Yet in this, all are names without substance, not actual fixed positions. They are merely metaphors and symbols used to express ideas! The furnace is the cauldron, the cauldron is the furnace. The Yellow Court is the qi cavity, the qi cavity is the Yellow Court. All converge in one place—there is only this place. Only here can one receive the primordial qi, apply the firing times, and transform the postnatal into the primordial, returning to the root and restoring the source. The *Zhonghe Ji* takes body and mind as furnace and cauldron. Master Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* says: ‘Heaven and Earth are the furnace and cauldron.’ All are boundless, wondrous metaphors—one must deeply embody them to realize the ancients’ words were not in error."*

**Eulogy:**
The place where life gathers,
Surely has its direction.
Inner and outer Yellow Court,
A single scroll ascends the hall.
Yet without form or body,
Its name is but a forced designation.
Once its mystery is grasped,
Never forget it for long.

If one asks, *"Then what of the principles of medicinal substances and the methods of their gathering?"* Master Donglei replies: *"Medicinal substances are the primordial True One’s qi, along with essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent. The primordial True One’s qi is the utmost reality of Non-Ultimate that one receives at birth, arising from the division of the Great Ultimate. That heaven-bestowed speck—●—descends into the mother’s womb, congealing with the yin and yang of the parents to form a human being. This speck of life’s root is the primordial True One’s qi, also called the qi of Great Unity containing reality. The Great Ultimate further transforms into yin and yang, and yin and yang generate the Five Phases. Their essential quintessence coalesces into essence, qi, and spirit, so this primordial qi lies concealed within the postnatal. Yet its rooting place is always within the qi cavity of the navel—thus the navel’s life-stem is called the ancestral aperture, like the root of a flower or the stem of a fruit.*

*By fifteen or sixteen, when postnatal qi is full, the essence orifice opens naturally. At the sight of beauty, the heart stirs, the root is touched, and the spirit sways—whereupon the true origin is broken. From then on, the primordial qi gradually depletes. Yet at every transition between the hours of *hai* and *zi*, the yin and yang within the body must conjoin. At each union, the True One’s qi spontaneously generates and transforms into postnatal essence, qi, and spirit to sustain the person. Thus the moment when yin and yang conjoin and true yang arises is called the *living midnight hour*, and the true yang produced is the so-called primordial One qi. Gathering this qi at that moment, applying the firing times, refining and tempering it—preventing its transformation into the postnatal—one may also merge the body’s qi with essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent into one, all transmuting into the primordial. This replenishes past deficiencies. Daily gathering and daily replenishment, when full, restore one to the state before the breaking of the body—this is called *returning the elixir*, the restoration of one’s original true origin.*

*When yang arises at midnight, in heaven and earth it is the true midnight hour; in humans, it is the living midnight hour. At this time, the external kidneys must rise—this is when the true midnight hour arrives. Yet if human desire stirs, yang must arise, and once arisen, it is difficult to restrain, inevitably depleting and dispersing. Even if it does not exit the external orifice, the three fires of sovereign, minister, and assistant within the body flare up, and the primordial instantly transforms into the postnatal, rendering it useless. Thus the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: ‘What is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen.’ Wu Chongxu said: ‘One must distinguish the clarity or turbidity of the water’s source. The clear may be used; the turbid may not.’ What is clarity? It is when true yang arises without the stirring of thought. If yang arises only after a thought moves, it is called turbid. Thus clarity and turbidity depend on whether thought moves or not.*

*Yet when beginners practice, their thoughts do not stir. Suddenly, true yang arises spontaneously, and the external kidneys must rise. But as soon as they rise, thoughts surge forth, and the true yang generated instantly transforms into the postnatal. Therefore, for cultivators, gathering the thoughts is the foremost task. Thus the four words—*restrain anger, suppress desire*—are the great pivot of nature and life. For those in youth or prime, repair and replenishment are easier; by fifty, it already feels arduous, and for the elderly, it is even more laborious. As Ancestral Master Zhongli said: ‘Do not wait until old age when lead and mercury are scarce.’ How profound these words!"*

Yet the young possess both ease and difficulty in their youth, just as the elderly possess both ease and difficulty in their age. For the young, what is easy lies in their vigorous spirit and the swift progress of their practice; what is difficult lies in the blazing fire of desire and the challenge of preserving essence. For the elderly, what is easy lies in the waning of desire and the subsiding of its fire; what is difficult lies in the decline of vitality and the sluggish advance of their practice. Those with resolve in this endeavor must ponder this deeply.

Now, what is meant by "gathering and refining" is not gathering yet gathering, not refining yet refining. As the ancient perfected ones said: *"Gather the medicine within stillness, conduct the firing process within non-doing."* One need only settle the mind in clarity and quiescence, abiding in serene stillness. For the principle of yin and yang is this: stillness carried to its extreme gives rise to movement, and movement carried to its extreme returns to stillness. When sitting reaches the utmost stillness, true yang will naturally arise. I then stabilize it with stillness. Once it has arisen, I continue to guard the mind with serene concentration, not attaching to any fixed place, attaining emptiness and quiescence. Practicing thus day by day, it naturally accumulates daily, growing and filling day by day. When qi fills the cinnabar field, fire blazes below the perineum. At this time, with a subtle intention, push and guide it back to the coccyx. When true qi is sufficient, it will naturally penetrate the three barriers—though some may pass through them gradually. Only after the three barriers are open may one proceed with the firing process.

*In praise:*
*From nothing, something arises; stillness at its extreme moves.*
*At life’s inception, serene and self-contained.*
*Push past the three carts, and the primordial is fully revealed.*
*To conduct the firing process—non-doing is its essence.*

One asks: *"In the alchemical texts, there is mention of ‘gold within water’ and also ‘lead from the watery realm.’ What do these mean?"*

Master Donglei replies: *"‘Gold within water’ is the same as ‘lead from the watery realm’—for lead is also a metal. Now, the heart pertains to fire, the kidneys to water. Within the heart dwells spirit, which pertains to fire; within the kidneys dwells essence, which pertains to water. Yet though the kidneys are the storehouse of essence, they do not originally possess it. It is only when a thought stirs, when the fire of desire arises, and the sovereign and ministerial fires blaze together, that the entire body grows hot. The steam thus produced condenses into water, gathering in the kidney palace, seizing the yang gate to exit through the external orifice, transforming into the essence of lustful fluid. If one can keep thoughts from stirring and desire from arising, then when the time comes, the true blackness that arises is none other than the primordial true unity of qi—this is the so-called ‘gold within water.’ At this moment, it is called the celestial mechanism. It does not arise from the kidneys but emerges from the midst of emptiness, passing through the kidneys. Because it issues from the kidneys, it is called ‘gold within water,’ also named ‘lead from the watery realm.’*

*Generally, the human heart is solid without and hollow within, pertaining to fire—likened to *li*. *Li* is yang without and yin within. The kidneys are hollow without and solid within, pertaining to water—likened to *kan*. *Kan* is yin without and yang within. Now, *kan* and *li* are the broken bodies of *qian* and *kun*. *Qian* is three yangs, *kun* is three yins. When the central line of *qian* moves, it enters *kun*; the central line of *kun* shifts into *qian*. *Qian* thus becomes *li*, and *kun* becomes *kan*. Therefore, when the alchemist gathers the one qi from the kidneys and raises it into the heart, it is like taking the central line from *kan* and filling the *li* palace—this is called ‘taking from *kan* to fill *li*.’ The *qian* trigram pertains to metal, the *kan* trigram to water. The central line of *kan* is the central line of *qian*—this is called ‘gold within water.’"*

*In praise:*
*Thought is originally no-thought;*
*Only where it arises does it truly arise.*

The vast and inexhaustible—this is the essence of Heaven’s One. *Kan* and *li* exchange positions, without scent or sound. Serene and still, it ascends to the Jade Capital.

One may ask: “Having gathered this primordial *qi* as the elixir, how then is the firing process to be conducted?”

Donglei replies: “The firing process is also a natural one, requiring only slight intentional action. As the ancients said: ‘True fire has no fixed timing; the great elixir is not measured by weight.’ Yet the old methods used the thirty-six counting rods of *qian* and the twenty-four of *kun*, employing breath to tally them—this was called ‘refinement and smelting.’”

*In praise:*
What is the firing process?
It passes as naturally as a face.
No timing to time,
no measure for the elixir.
*Qian* and *kun* have their rods,
a discipline to follow.

One may ask: “What is the purpose of the rods? How is breath to be used?”

Donglei replies: “The method of refinement is called the firing process. The ancients treated it with utmost gravity, for it is an exceedingly secret celestial mechanism. As the *Alchemical Canon* states: ‘The sage transmits the elixir but not the fire; few have ever known the firing process.’ For when the elixir is born, the person is born; only when the elixir is born may fire be applied. To apply fire without the elixir is like boiling empty water and fire—futile. Fire is the elixir, and the elixir is fire; when fire is born, the elixir is born. As Master Bai said: ‘Refining the elixir with fire to form the cinnabar is the same as guiding *qi* with spirit to realize the Dao.’

If one applies fire without the elixir’s birth, the fire is not true fire—merely exhausting the mouth and nose. Now, one exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. The true *qi* within the body, rising and falling, is also called a breath. *Xi* (breath) means rest; in rest, there is stability. When it moves, it is gone; when gone, it returns to the root of ceaseless generation. The ancients retired at dusk to rest, nurturing their vital mechanism. As Master Shao said: ‘After the winter solstice comes exhalation; after the summer solstice, inhalation—this is the breath of a year. In a single day, exhalation follows midnight, and inhalation follows noon. One exhalation and one inhalation make a breath.’ *Xi* also means nurture. With ceaseless breath, ceaseless generation follows, and transformation becomes boundless. Thus, a person’s every breath is of no small consequence. With each inhalation, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth returns to me; with each exhalation, my *qi* returns to Heaven and Earth. The *Scripture of Yin Conformity* says: ‘Heaven and Earth steal from the myriad things; the myriad things steal from humans; humans steal from the myriad things. When these three thefts are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace.’ These three ‘thefts’ mutually steal, and their mechanism lies in the mouth and nose. If one grasps this principle, then Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all become one’s own theft. Without the secret, one is instead stolen by Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things.

Yet in practicing the firing process, one moves the body’s true *qi* in its natural ascent and descent—not the breath of mouth and nose. These are merely borrowed as triggers. For beginners whose Three Passes are yet unopened, this is the necessary gateway, and regulation of breath must come first. Once the Three Passes are open, the celestial mechanism of natural ascent and descent emerges—only then is it truly called the firing process.

As for breath: in exhalation, the breath of mouth and nose issues outward, while the body’s true *qi* descends from the chest to the navel; in inhalation, the breath of mouth and nose enters, while the body’s true *qi* rises from the coccyx along the spine to the crown. Focus must rest within the body, not on the mouth and nose. The mind lodges in the breath, and the ear listens to its sound. As the Perfected Master Sima said: ‘Exhale only gently; inhale only softly.’ Ensure the breath is neither coarse, nor hurried, nor rapid, nor slow—regulate it to harmony, so the ear does not hear its sound. When the mind is still, the breath naturally harmonizes; when the breath harmonizes, the spirit naturally congeals. This is what is meant by ‘mind and breath depending on each other, breath harmonized and mind settled.’ When the breath is so refined as to seem present yet absent, gently concentrate awareness on the lower *dantian*. Naturally, spirit congeals and *qi* gathers, suffusing the body with warmth. As Master Bai said: ‘Once I received the true oral transmission from the sage: simply concentrate spirit into the *qi*-cavern.’ The *Alchemical Canon* also says: ‘To regulate breath, regulate the true; with every breath, refine spirit, refining until it is no longer spirit.’ This is what ‘spirit’ refers to.

With true accumulation over time, true *qi* grows daily. When it becomes abundant, it naturally penetrates the Three Passes. Once the Three Passes are open, true *qi* ascends and descends of itself. Within this ascent and descent, the thirty-six rods of *qian* and twenty-four of *kun* are employed. The method of using the rods involves circling the fingers to mark the twelve hours. When the first yang is born, press the finger to the *zi* position and count the natural breaths of ascent and descent—one rise and one fall make a breath. Count thirty-six breaths and stop, then shift to the *chou* position and count thirty-six more. Move to *yin* and count thirty-six again; at *mao*, do not count the breaths but place the mind in emptiness and stillness—the mechanism will pause of itself. This is called ‘bathing.’ After a brief pause, the mechanism stirs again. Press the finger to the *chen* position and count thirty-six breaths; move to *si* and count thirty-six more—this is called ‘advancing the yang fire.’ ‘Advancing’ means spirit resides in the abdomen of *kun*, while awareness reaches the crown. At the *wu* position, count twenty-four breaths; move to *wei* and count twenty-four more; move to *shen* and count twenty-four again. At *you*, do not count the breaths but again place the mind in emptiness and stillness—the mechanism will naturally pause once more. This is called ‘bathing.’”

After a brief pause, the mechanism stirs again. Press the finger to the *xu* position and count twenty-four breaths; move to *hai* and count twenty-four more, then perform five additional breaths—together completing the three hundred sixty-five degrees of the celestial cycle. Counting twenty-four breaths is called ‘retreating the yin tally.’ ‘Retreating’ means awareness resides in the abdomen of *kun*, while spirit is nurtured and guarded like an egg. This is called the ‘fire-tending of the minor celestial cycle.’

Once the celestial count is complete, spirit converges within the qi cavity, still and guarded. One attains emptiness and stillness, gradually releasing the mind into the realm of nothing-whatsoever, naturally arriving at the state of primordial chaos. Then qi transforms into spirit, and spirit transforms into emptiness. In truth, this is nothing but the coagulation of one’s original spirit, forged into oneness, refined into a protective barrier, to perfect the dharma-body.

Though these are the established words of the ancients, they should not be taken as fixed method. For if the mind clings to numbers, it inevitably involves deliberate effort.

"If one employs deliberate intent, the fire burns too fiercely, and the heart-mind grows restless. Should one persist in this practice, there is the risk of the fire scorching one’s essence. It is far safer to rely solely on the eight characters: ‘heart-mind and breath interdependent, stillness and emptiness congealing illumination.’ Naturally, spirit will coagulate and qi will gather, suffusing the entire body with harmonious equilibrium."

In praise it is said:
Heaven and earth open and close—
such is the rhythm of breath.
Yet all this complexity
is not as sure as stillness itself.
Heart-mind and breath interdependent,
the wondrous principle of stillness and emptiness.
Illumination congealed without cease—
harmonious equilibrium arises of itself.

One asks: "The alchemical texts say, ‘The moon’s fullness depends on the oral transmission; the hour of *zi* lies in the heart’s transmission.’ What does this mean?"

Donglei replies: "This ‘moon’s fullness’ refers to the fullness of yang qi and the sufficiency of yang light. Consider the moon in the sky: from the third day, it waxes faintly as yang emerges from the *geng* direction—this is the birth of the first yang. By the eighth day, the eastern half is filled with yang, the *hun* within the *po* half—this is the birth of the second yang, called the ‘upper quarter.’ By the fifteenth day, the third yang is born, yang light is complete, and the moon is full. On the sixteenth day, the first yin is born, and the moon begins to wane. By the twenty-third day, only the western half remains yang, the *po* within the *hun* half—this is the birth of the second yin, called the ‘lower quarter.’ By the thirtieth day, the third yin is born, the *hun* is wholly concealed, and the moon is entirely dark.

The moon’s body is inherently yin and without light; it borrows the *hun* of the sun to generate brightness. The sun is yang spirit; the moon is yin essence. Yang generates brightness, while yin itself has no light. Thus, the moon must rely on the sun’s illumination to shine—this is called ‘the upper quarter’s gold, half a catty; the lower quarter’s water, eight ounces.’ Within these two quarters of gold and water lie both the medicinal substances and the firing times.

In the human body, true essence belongs to yin and is likened to the moon; true spirit belongs to yang and is likened to the sun. The two characters *jing* and *shen* are threaded together by qi. Thus, refining essence into qi means refining away yin essence to form pure yang’s origin. Refining qi into spirit means transforming qi entirely into spirit. Refining spirit to return to emptiness means dissolving even this spirit, merging with the emptiness of Great Vacuity.

Therefore, the initial birth of true yang is likened to the moon emerging from the *geng* direction. When qi penetrates the *jiājí* (spine’s midpoint), it is likened to the upper quarter. When qi reaches the crown of the head, it is likened to the full moon. Once qi arrives at the *níwán* (mud-pill palace), it must descend—comparable to the sixteenth day’s birth of the first yin. When qi descends to the *jiàngōng* (crimson palace), it is likened to the lower quarter. Descending further into the qi cavity is likened to the thirtieth day’s dark moon. At this point of darkness, the sun and moon unite, and *hun* and *po* merge.

Thus, the full moon is valued for its sufficiency of yang light. The moon requires fifteen days to become full, which is why the *Luoshu*’s numbers array nine atop and one below, three on the left and seven on the right, two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet. One resides in the north and nine in the south; adding the central five yields fifteen from due north to due south. Three resides in the east and seven in the west; adding the central five yields fifteen from due east to due west. Two resides in the southwest and eight in the northeast; adding the central five yields fifteen from northeast to southwest. Six resides in the northwest and four in the southeast; adding the central five yields fifteen from northwest to southeast. Excluding the central five, the north’s one, northeast’s eight, and northwest’s six together make fifteen. The south’s nine, southeast’s four, and southwest’s two together make fifteen. The east’s three, combined with the southeast’s four and northeast’s eight, make fifteen. The west’s seven, combined with the southwest’s two and northwest’s six, make fifteen. Interwoven thus, all paths sum to fifteen.

For three is the beginning of generation, five its culmination, and ten the end of completion. The principle of generation and completion is three and five making fifteen. Indeed, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand—all are but one. The circulation of a single qi inherently contains the numbers of generation and completion.

The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are mutually complementary. In the *Hetu*, heaven’s one water combines with heaven’s nine metal to make ten; heaven’s three wood combines with heaven’s seven fire to make ten; earth’s two fire combines with earth’s eight wood to make ten; earth’s four metal combines with earth’s six water to make ten. Concealed within is fifty, with one, three, five, seven, and nine as heaven’s numbers, and two, four, six, eight, and ten as earth’s numbers. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five, earth’s thirty. Thus, the numbers of heaven and earth total fifty-five, and the *Hetu* already contains the complete numbers of heaven and earth.

The *Hetu*’s sequence—one, six, two, seven, three, eight, four, nine, five, ten—corresponds to the *Luoshu*’s one, nine, two, eight, three, seven, four, six, forming mutual complementarity. Thus, within the *Hetu*’s generation and completion lies the *Luoshu*’s correspondence.

The *Qingnang Jingzhuan* states: ‘The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* both establish the pole through this fifteen.’ Though the *Hetu* contains the Four Images, in the primordial state yang ascends and yin descends, the upper and lower are only just divided—it cannot yet be called the four directions. Only when the central five establishes the pole do the four poles distinctly assume their positions. With the four cardinal directions fixed, the four corners interpose between them, and thus the eight directions are established. This is the natural revelation of heaven and earth’s principle.

Therefore, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are the origin of principle, qi, image, and number. One, two, three, four, five are heaven; six, seven, eight, nine, ten are earth. Heaven and earth each attain their five, and the union of two fives makes ten—this is the Dao of fifteen."

Let the scholar not fail to comprehend the establishment of the pole through this fifteen! What is called the "Child of the Hour" refers to the *living* midnight within the body. The midnight of the twelfth double-hour is the *proper* midnight; the *living* midnight is not bound to any fixed time. This living midnight is known only to oneself and not to others—hence it is said, "The wonder lies in mind-to-mind transmission," for the celestial mind awakens and is conveyed through the heart.

**Eulogy:**
Yin and yang ascend and descend,
Wondrously forming the elixir.
New moon and full moon give rise to one another,
With fifteen as their beginning.
Vivid and free,
Seen only within the heart.
Heaven and man unite,
Everlastingly whole.

Huìchè said, "Master, in your words, do you speak of *this-side* matters? Or *that-side* matters? Or is there yet another mystery to *that-side* matters?"
Dòngléi replied, "What I have spoken pertains to the work of returning the elixir—this still belongs to *this-side* matters. Yet if we discuss the Three Vehicles, it already belongs to *that-side*! However, our school of Celestial Immortals belongs to the Supreme Vehicle, the most exalted, and possesses the celestial mechanism of *that-side* mysteries. Unless one is a person of luminous virtue, who has accumulated true effort over a long time, it cannot be spoken of. To speak lightly and reveal it would only breed doubt. For when the heart is not light and empty, principle and desire inevitably contend. If principle is obscured and desire prevails, it will invariably flow into heterodox teachings. Leading the blind with blindness—how could the harm to later generations be slight?"

**Eulogy:**
Cultivate nature and preserve life,
Principle and desire contend not.
The essence of Celestial Immortals
Lies in clarity and brightness.
The profound and subtle Dao
Is naturally pure and still.
This-side and that-side,
Wondrously merge and congeal.

Thereupon, Huìchè withdrew with reverence, observing the Six Abstinences and the Five Precepts. After seventy-five days, on the auspicious dawn of the Winter Solstice in the mid-month of winter, he swept the courtyard, bathed, and burned incense. He invited Master Léi to ascend once more to the Hall of the *Yijing*, performing the rites with solemnity, even cutting his flesh to swear an oath to heaven. On that day, propitious winds fanned widely, and auspicious clouds blanketed the sky. Huìchè, assuming the role of disciple, advanced, knelt, and entreated, "Formerly, I awakened to my original nature, cultivating both samādhi and wisdom in dual practice, believing the Dao to be therein. I have reverently heard the principle of returning the elixir, which has suddenly cleared my obstructions. Yet I have also heard of the Supreme Vehicle of the Celestial Immortals, the celestial mechanism of profound mystery, incomparable to the Three Vehicles. I beseech you, Master, in your compassion, to grant me deliverance."
Dòngléi exclaimed, "Ah! To transmit to one who is worthy is not to lose a celestial treasure; to transmit to one who is unworthy is to suffer dark retribution..."

To speak when one should and not to speak when one should not—this is to lose the person; to speak when one should not and not to speak when one should—this is to lose the words. The wise neither lose the person nor the words; now I understand! You are indeed teachable. Come! Let me tell you.

This is the meaning of ascending the heights from the humble, journeying afar from the near. Generally, the methods of the Supreme Vehicle all begin with first refining essence to transform it into *qi*, refining *qi* to transform it into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness. Only in the final step do they re-establish the furnace and cauldron, re-erect Heaven and Earth, and focus solely on refining nature to achieve the union of emptiness and the Dao—a method of first cultivating life and then cultivating nature.

Yet our Celestial Immortals’ tradition proceeds entirely from cultivating nature, for when nature is perfected, life is naturally perfected. This is the study of fulfilling nature to realize destiny, ultimately cultivating the upper pass while encompassing the middle and lower passes—what Zhuangzi called “forgetting spirit and transcending life.”

Its profound mystery differs from the three vehicles of the Three Vehicles. Here, the Great Emptiness serves as the furnace and cauldron, the Three Primes as the medicinal substances, the Celestial Heart as the master of creation, the Mysterious Pass as the gate of total holding, and transformation through unity as the non-dual dharma.

The *Discourse on Resolving Doubts* states: “To concentrate spirit and gather *qi* is to guard the city; to forget scheming and sever thoughts is to govern life and death. Samādhi and wisdom are water and fire; action and cessation are advance and retreat. Natural purity is the operation; harmonious *qi* steaming is the bathing. Years, months, days, and hours are the firing times; forging into one mass is the union; shattering emptiness is the completion.”

Master Qiong Guan said: “The Dao of the Celestial Immortals is like a pearl turning in a crystal dish—rolling freely, vibrantly alive. How could it be bound by yin and yang within the Five Phases? One must leap beyond Heaven and Earth to be called a person who has attained the Dao.”

Its method is simple and direct; transmitted through the heart, it is easily accomplished. Other Supreme Vehicle methods involve hexagrams and lines, weights and measures—their methods are complex and difficult. A hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation, hence the saying, “The slightest divergence fails to produce the elixir.”

I transmit this to you through the heart; you must grasp it with the heart.

In praise it is said:
Its marvel transcends all bounds; its Way is effortlessly simple.
Shattering emptiness—this is the utmost attainment.
Hair-fine and thus unchanging, reverent and thought-free.
Transmitted through the heart, spoken by mouth—most precious, most secret.

Hui Che asked: “What distinguishes the Supreme Vehicle from the Three Vehicles?”
Master Lei replied: “The distinction lies in *that*, *this*, *this side*, and *that side*!
On this side, essence, qi, and spirit are the Three Origins.
On that side, Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the Three Origins.
The Three Origins of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity encompass all vastness and penetrate all subtlety.
The Three Origins of essence, qi, and spirit pertain solely to the individual body.
Now, original essence, original qi, and original spirit are innate to this body—hence called *this*, belonging to this side.
The Origins of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are nothing other than what this self possesses—hence called *that*, belonging to that side.
In the Three Vehicles, nature and life are divided into *that* and *this*, or earlier and later are divided into *that* and *this*; the Nature School is this side, the Life School is that side.
We of the Celestial Immortals make no division between *that* and *this*—all is unified by a single principle!”

In praise it is said:
The Origins of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—gateway to the Way.
No division of *that* and *this*, only this alone is revered.
Permeated by a single principle, embracing Qian and Kun,
Wondrous and supreme—the Supreme Way abides herein.

Huìchè said, “What is most crucial?”
Master Léi replied, “Opening the Mysterious Pass is the foremost crucial point. For the Mysterious Pass is the great gate of the body. If the great gate remains shut, how can one ascend the hall and enter the chamber to gather and refine the Three Origins as one’s medicinal substances?”

In praise it is said:
Mysterious Pass, Mysterious Pass—realm of all wonders.
Unfurled or rolled, bestowed by imperial favor.
Blossoms fragrant yet not fragrant, the crescent moon curved yet not curved.
To recognize the true face, return to Mount Lu.

Huìchè said, “In cultivating the Golden Elixir, all regard the opening of the Three Passes as the foremost task. Now you speak of the Mysterious Pass as crucial—how does this differ from the Three Passes?”
Master Léi replied, “The Three Passes have distinctions of front and back. The three behind: the Tailbone, Jiaji, and Jade Pillow, are called the Front Three Passes. The three in front: Mud Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, and Lower Elixir Field, are called the Rear Three Passes. As the *Elixir Canon* states: ‘Front three threes, rear three threes, gather them up, one morning’s burden.’ The Front Three Passes lie within the spine, governing the Governing Vessel; the Rear Three Passes lie in the chest, governing the Conception Vessel. When the Conception and Governing Vessels are unobstructed, the hundred meridians of the body are all unobstructed. If the Front and Rear Three Passes are all opened in a single morning, it is as if borne upon the shoulders—hence called ‘one morning’s burden.’

Yet these Conception and Governing Vessels are the red and black paths. The *Elixir Book* says: ‘The human path follows the principle of the navel, between the back and front, where lies an aperture called the Pass of Origin.’ This is the principle of descending through the lower yellow, ascending via the yellow path, directly piercing the central yellow and upper yellow. The *Elixir Book* marks this as: ‘The Daoist path—this is the yellow path through which the Three Treasures of the primordial share passage,’ also called the Yellow Center, truly the governing place of the Daoist path. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: ‘The Yellow Center penetrates principle, rightly positioned within the body.’ This is the root of life and destiny in our born bodies. This place communicates with the Great Simplicity of Heaven and Earth as if through a single nose—what Laozi called ‘the gate of the Mysterious Female,’ also said to be ‘the root of Heaven and Earth.’ Its gate is called the Core of the Pass of Origin, the portal of yin and yang’s entry and exit—hence also called the Pass. For it is said, ‘profound and unfathomable,’ and from this profundity all wonders arise—this is where the Great Ultimate of the body establishes its pole.

There is none who is not born thereby—how could one not likewise return by this path in cultivation? Thus the superior returning elixir must first gather the primordial qi, descending from the Pass of Origin, ascending counterflow to Kunlun, then descending to the Crimson Palace, lowering to the Elixir Field, entering the qi cavity, where fire and water regimens are stored and practiced—this is called refining and tempering. Therefore, in the methods of our Celestial Immortals, from beginning to end of practice, nothing lies beyond the Mysterious Pass—how could it be merely the first step of cultivation?”

In praise it is said:
Rightly positioned within the body, the Yellow Center penetrates principle.
No end to the end, no beginning to the beginning.
From start to finish of practice, nothing lies beyond this.
Communing with the Great Simplicity, befriending the Yellow and Li.

Huìchè said, “If the Mysterious Pass is opened first, must these Three Passes still be opened or not?”
Master Léi replied, “If the Mysterious Pass is opened first, there is no need to open the Three Passes again! For after the Three Passes are opened, one must further practice emptiness and stillness—this is entering from without to attain emptiness. When the Mysterious Pass opens, it is emptiness issuing from within. Entering from without may be true or false: true, then inner and outer are as one; false, then outwardly it seems empty while inwardly it remains solid. To attain inner emptiness requires great effort—only when one reaches true oblivion can this be so, and only then is there real efficacy. Thus when the Mysterious Pass opens, the body becomes like a luminous gauze shell, every pore and aperture open, the true mechanism ascending and descending with its own path, no longer dependent on these Three Passes. If the Three Passes are opened first, the Mysterious Pass must still be opened before the Three Origins can be gathered.”

In praise it is said:
Having attained the profound principle, what need for the three?
The three have form, the One Origin is bottomless.
With the formless embracing the formed, Kunlun transforms into carp.
Wondrous indeed, the Origin of Origins—splendid beyond compare.

Huìchè said, “I wish to know the secret essentials of opening the Mysterious Pass.”
Master Léi replied, “For beginners, the difficulty lies in the heart’s lack of stability and the spirit’s lack of tranquility! If one can achieve spirit-concentration and qi-stillness, standing at the prior-to-the-primordial, opening the Mysterious Pass is an easy matter. The former master said: ‘Practice begins with no-thought.’ Thus the methods for beginners have several techniques.

First: Let go of all entanglements, and the body naturally becomes still and empty—this is the oral instruction of the former master’s ‘merging transformation.’ Yet people are constantly in turmoil, the heart never at rest for a moment, like a hundred-boiling cauldron—how can one attain emptiness and stillness? Without a handle, how can one proceed? The practitioner first uses self-mind to observe the source of mind—then the body is still and the spirit empty. This mind-source is not the fleshy heart within the body, but that which is still and spiritually luminous. Use the ‘neither approaching nor departing’ method to guard it, so the mind does not attach to any place. Guard it thus, always sensing this space as hollow and vast, unstained by anything, only feeling congealed and still, embracing the spirit in quiescence. This is precisely what is meant by ‘the heart having a master can remain unmoved.’ As the *Diamond Sutra* says: ‘One should give rise to the mind without abiding anywhere.’

Second: Constantly operate this heart, withdrawing it into the aperture of Jiaji, guarding without departure. Naturally, wayward thoughts scatter, scattered concerns dissolve, restless impulses settle, and false thoughts cease. Over time, the true breath appears and there is no breath.”

When breath ceases, the foundation of life is firmly established! This is the excellent method of "turning the back" from the *Great Change* (Yijing). Another method: visualize the *Shangen* (Mountain Root). At the moment of human conception, the nose is formed first—called the "Ancestral Mountain Root," located between the eyebrows at the top of the nose. This point connects with the *Zuqiao* (Ancestral Aperture), which can seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth. Thus, in visualizing the *Shangen*, neither forget nor force it; hold it as if present, as if forgotten. Over time, one feels emptiness, stillness, and quiescence, as the *Shangen* and *Zuqiao* merge into one. Guard this with stillness, then forget it entirely. With long practice, one day the body and mind are placed in a state beyond recognition, where one’s spirit merges into undifferentiated oneness. At this stage of profound unity, one enters the true realm of the *Xuanqiao* (Mysterious Aperture). The critical moment hinges on a single thought: think of immortality, and one becomes immortal; think of the mundane, and one remains mundane. This is the principle of resonance and response.

If, in this undifferentiated state, one suddenly perceives boundlessness—whether stars and moon over the sea, the moon’s reflection in the waves, or vast expanses of still water and lush vegetation—such ineffable mysteries signify the opening of the *Xuanqiao* (Mysterious Pass)! Yet if a thought stirs and clings, the *Xuanqiao* vanishes at once. Thus, stillness must be met with stillness. Once this pass opens, one breathes in unison with the Great Primal, encompassing the Three Powers and Six Directions without being contained by them, becoming one with the Great Void. When the mechanism within reaches this point, the spirit perceives all, and various true and illusory forms appear in succession. One may only awaken to them but must not cling. As the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states:

*“This aperture is no ordinary aperture,
Formed by the union of Heaven and Earth.
Called the Cavern of Spirit and Qi,
Within it lies the essence of Kan and Li.”*

This precisely refers to the *Xuanqiao*. The furnace and cauldron are established here, the medicine is gathered here, the fire times are practiced here, and even the formation of the embryo and attainment of sagehood occur here. Whether employing mind-breath interdependence or preserving spirit in emptiness and stillness, the key lies in "as if present, as if forgotten," neither approaching nor departing. Above all, relinquish body and mind, still all concerns, and observe with quiescence—then spirit will congeal and qi will settle naturally.

Scholars must first take "no-thought" as their foundation. Sincerity and constancy will ensure entry without fail.

**Eulogy:**
Embodiment still, spirit empty,
All entanglements released.
Utmost sincerity without cease,
What need for day or night?
Suddenly, as if all opens,
Like myriad transformations.
Awakened yet still quiescent,
Entering the Dao’s infant and maiden.

Huiche asked: “Previously, the *Huangting* qi cavity was called the furnace and cauldron; elsewhere, body and mind, or Heaven and Earth, serve as furnace and cauldron. Now the Great Void is named as such. The profound subtleties of this teaching—might you further elucidate?”

Master Lei replied: “The two words ‘body’ and ‘mind’ encompass all the volumes in the world. The body is not the physical form but the *Dharmakāya*. The mind is not the human mind but the Heavenly Mind. The *Dharmakāya* has no body yet possesses body; the Heavenly Mind has mind yet is without mind. Without deep understanding of creation and thorough penetration of the mysterious mechanism, this cannot be known.

The *Huangting* lies above the qi cavity, connected above and below. Within the qi cavity, there is also the *qi* cavity. The qi cavity stores the postnatal true qi, while the *qi* cavity is where the prenatal original *qi* is received—this is precisely the location of the *Xuanqiao*. *Qian* is Heaven, the yang; *Kun* is Earth, the yin.”

The upper half of the human body pertains to yang, the lower half to yin. As the *Yi* states: “*Qian* is the head, *Kun* is the belly.” For nature resides in the *Niwan* [mud-pill palace], while life dwells within the navel. Thus, true nature belongs to *Qian*, and Heavenly Mandate to *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the true nature and life.

Yet *Qian* and *Kun* possess the principle of mutual exchange, and yin and yang hold the mechanism of inversion. Within nature lies true life, and within life resides true nature—hence the analogy of the *Qian-Kun* crucible and cauldron. That the Great Void serves as crucible and cauldron is because the Great Void encompasses the six directions, with heaven, earth, and the myriad things all contained within it. My *Xuanqiao* is of the same substance as the Great Void, taking heaven and earth as its heart and true emptiness as its function. The Great Void of heaven and earth is the cauldron, and my Great Void is the crucible—thus borrowing the Great Void as crucible and cauldron.

The cauldron is the vessel for placing things, the crucible the tool for storing fire—nothing more than instruments for containing medicine and fire! Why then distinguish between crucible and cauldron?”

*Eulogy:*
The Dao is non-existent yet existent,
The mind is existent yet non-existent.
*Qian* and *Kun* inverted,
Exchange belongs to me alone.
Nature and life interdependent,
The Great Void as crucible and cauldron,
To refine and temper,
To walk with the sages.

Huìchè asked: “What is the essential meaning of the ‘medicinal substances’?”
Master Lei replied: “Regarding medicinal substances: in the lower-grade elixir method, saliva, essence, fluids, blood, and sweat serve as medicines; in the middle-grade, essence, *qi*, and spirit are the medicines; in the upper-grade, spirit, *hun*, *po*, intent, and the prenatal original *qi* are the medicines—all pertain to the work of returning the elixir, nothing more than this dharma-realm.

Only in our Heavenly Immortal tradition do we take the *Taiji* as the elixir mother and the Three Origins as the medicinal substances. The elixir mother is used to congeal the elixir, while the medicinal substances are used for nourishment. *Yuan* means great. The *qi* of the Three Powers is pure, true, and unadulterated—great and transformed into the wondrous and divine. These are the *Qian* Origin, *Kun* Origin, and Human Origin.

*Qian* is Heaven, also called the Heavenly Origin; *Kun* is Earth, also called the Earthly Origin. The origins of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—the Three Powers—are all nurtured within the Great Void. Their origin arises from the heart. The heart of Heaven is on Earth, the heart of Earth is in Heaven, and the heart of Heaven and Earth is lodged in humanity. Thus, humanity is the most precious of the Three Powers; without humanity, Heaven and Earth would have no means to manifest as such.

The human origin disperses within Heaven and Earth and is stored within the Great Void. Therefore, our ancestor, the Venerable Great Void, said: ‘The Human Origin pervades the great thousand worlds; the Three Origins are governed by one heart.’ Thus, we gather the medicine from within the Great Void and conduct the fire times within the *Xuanqiao*.

The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: ‘The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the one *qi*; from this one *qi*, yin and yang are produced.’ Emptiness is the *Wuji*. From *Wuji* comes *Taiji*; the extreme of non-being is the Great Ultimate—there are not two. When *Taiji* divides into the Two Modes, it is the one *qi* transforming into yin and yang. Thus, ‘one yin and one yang are called the Dao.’ Solitary yin and solitary yang are called the solitary yin-yang—this is the Dao’s function.

‘Yin and yang are born from the Dao; the Dao is fashioned from yin and yang. One who knows this awakens to clarity; each thing can embody the Dao. The wise who comprehend these words have penetrated the mystery of the *Xuanqiao*.’

Our ancestor, Master Mud-Pill, said: ‘The mechanism that stirs spontaneously within the twelve hours is the prenatal *qi*. If one can gather it in time, it is the supreme treasure.’ Should the scholar truly attain the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the prenatal one *qi* will naturally arrive from the realm of non-being.

My master said: ‘This prenatal *qi* is not merely the prenatal of the individual body but the ancestral *qi* of *Taiji*. The flowing *qi* of the Three Powers serves as nourishment, while the ancestral *qi* of *Taiji* can become the elixir mother—all belong to the great medicine. Without embodying emptiness and quiescence, without sitting in profound obscurity, there is no way to attain the principle.’”

*Eulogy:*
Take the ultimate as the foundation,
Take the origin as nourishment.
Though there are two,
Only humanity excels.
Imprint this in the heart,
Remember within emptiness.
Emptiness is not empty,
Boundless flower-rain.

Huìchè asked: “What is meant by ‘gathering’? What is meant by ‘fire times’?”
Master Lei replied: “As for gathering, one may follow the method of our ancestor Bai: sit upright in meditation to gather. When sitting upright in meditation reaches the state of profound obscurity and subtle indistinction, the nature-body becomes serene, and the one truth is revealed. This accords with the *Classic of Wondrous Purity*, which states: ‘If one can always be pure and still, heaven and earth will all return.’

The method is simply to attain utmost emptiness and profound stillness, concentrating the spirit to await the moment. When the central master within the heart is utterly still and unmoving, the mechanism stirs and the spirit awakens, allowing it to rise and fall naturally. One must not impose the slightest intention—only then does it accord with the spirit’s function. Over time, the spirit and breath will naturally manifest, becoming harmoniously full.

Should various signs appear, simply ensure this heart does not cling to them. With intent, guard the center, gathering the one intent into concentrated stillness, allowing its natural movement. Thus, fire times are to be left to their natural course. Refining and tempering are nothing more than *qi* returning within, the spirit operating within, and the spirit guiding the *qi*.

As the *Elixir Canon* states: ‘True fire has no fixed time; the great medicine is not measured by weight.’ It also says: ‘There is a natural true fire time; simply rest the spirit and breath, allowing them to be natural.’ The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: ‘The Primordial Heavenly Worthy gathers medicine daily, and the medicine becomes ever more inexhaustible. The Most High Lord Lao conducts the fire times ceaselessly, and the fire times become ever more endless.’

Thus, Heaven and Earth also gather medicine daily, and the sun and moon conduct fire times ceaselessly—hence they endure for billions of kalpas.”

Should even a single moment’s mechanism cease, Heaven and Earth would likewise collapse! Thus, when the years, months, days, and hours are spoken of as fire times, it is precisely to say they are not measured by years, months, days, or hours.

Yet before the Mysterious Pass has opened and the work has not yet reached true emptiness and true stillness, how can one rashly speak of gathering and refining? First, the body and mind must be scoured until spotlessly clean, so that the work may more readily attain the state of emptiness and stillness. Even then, within this emptiness and stillness, one must nurture a sense of ease and liveliness.

By emptiness and stillness is meant emptying the heart and stilling the nature. By ease and liveliness is meant fostering the free flow of *qi*’s mechanism. This work is not only to be practiced in stillness; even when engaging with affairs and interacting with others, one must maintain pure and familiar mastery, striving for what Master Cheng called “movement is samādhi, stillness is samādhi.” Only then can movement and stillness become one, and the work naturally advance—this is the true ground of great accomplishment.

When the work reaches the point where there is no inside or outside, no boundaries or limits, the Mysterious Pass will have opened, and the medicine will arise of itself. Only when the medicine arises in truth can it be genuine; otherwise, what is gathered remains but the mundane and illusory of the posterior heaven—how can it be called medicine? For only when the aperture opens and the time arrives does the medicine come into being and become available for gathering. Through the medicine, the mundane is transformed, and only then is the mundane truly transmuted.

*Eulogy:*
The Primordial One gathers medicine,
The Most High tends the furnace.
Wondrous and natural in function,
Heaven and Earth share in my Way.
Movement and stillness as one,
The Limitless unfolds its chart.
Attaining this supreme mystery,
Only then is the mortal frame transformed.

Huìchè said: “Samādhi and wisdom are likened to water and fire—are these the samādhi and wisdom of our tradition? And what is meant by ‘action and cessation as advance and retreat’?”

Master Léi replied: “Samādhi pertains to water, wisdom to fire. Samādhi is the settling of the heart; wisdom is the unification of the spirit. Within the heart lies the spirit, and the spirit pertains to fire. When thoughts and deliberations intrude, it is the *discriminating spirit*—this is mundane fire. The spirit untainted by form and appearance is the *original spirit*, the true fire, called the radiance of wisdom.

The reason for employing samādhi and wisdom is their dual application in a single principle. To settle the heart-spirit without clinging to form and appearance is called *awakened wisdom*. A settled heart with wisdom’s illumination is awareness in constant radiance. Using water to temper fire is radiance in constant awareness.

The difference between Buddhism and Daoism lies merely in whether the mechanism of *qi* is at ease or not. As for ‘action and cessation,’ this refers to the principle of advancing fire and withdrawing the tally. Practicing the work at this time is advancing fire; reaching the state of utter oblivion is withdrawing the tally—not merely the advancing and withdrawing of fire times in the conventional sense.

If one can truly attain utter oblivion, the foundation of the *Way of Undifferentiated Transformation* is laid here. In advancing fire and withdrawing the tally, there naturally appear wondrous celestial signs, beyond all conjecture. When the work reaches this point, marvelous awareness arises of itself.”

*Eulogy:*
Samādhi and wisdom beget one another,
Awareness and illumination ever bright.
Water tempers fire,
Returning to the Great Clarity.
The foundation of undifferentiated transformation,
Spontaneously upheld.
Beyond all conjecture,
Its wonder defies naming.

Huìchè said: “In ancient *Elixir Canons*, it is always said, ‘The union of *Kan* and *Li*,’ and there is also the saying of ‘the union of *Qian* and *Kun*.’ Does the school of Heavenly Immortals have such a state?”

Master Léi replied: “The union of *Kan* and *Li* exists in the Three Vehicles’ teachings, though it is not an absolute doctrine. As for the saying of *Qian* and *Kun*’s union, my master said: ‘When the scholar empties to the utmost and stills with utter sincerity, then sincerity within naturally attains profound samādhi. Suddenly, the mechanism stirs, and one instantly perceives a vast, luminous clarity, boundless and without limit. With a swift gathering of awareness, one immediately enters profound quiescence. After a while, a single point descends into the Yellow Court—this is the spontaneous return of the primordial *qi*, circulating through the Six Voids. I abide within it, aware only of a single true intention, feeling *qi* refreshed and spirit clear, body and mind harmonious and at ease—this is called the *Golden Liquid Returning Elixir*.’

In truth, it is formless and imageless, the solitary revelation of the numinous. *Qian* and *Kun* merge as one, completing my Supreme Ultimate.”

*Eulogy:*
*Qian* and *Kun* in union,
Sought with utmost sincerity.
Profound samādhi attained,
Brilliant clarity swiftly gathered.
After a moment, a single point—
*Qi* returns, circulating all.
Only true intention remains,
The *Golden Liquid* returns in excellence.

Huìchè said: “In cultivating the Dao, one must have a *Dao* companion—what does this mean?”

Master Léi replied: “This *Dao* companion is one’s teacher and friend. Generally, each practitioner’s endowment of *qi* differs, and so their progress varies. Thus, one must frequently discuss and inquire, earnestly questioning and reflecting, so that both parties benefit. If one merely practices alone without seeking explanation, the ancients called this ‘groping in the dark’ or ‘blind practice and reckless refinement’—it is difficult to achieve success.

For the deeper the work advances, the more subtle it becomes, and the more subtle, the more essential it is to discuss it. The slightest misstep leads to a hundred errors. At such times, one must have a renowned teacher and beneficial friends to point out and analyze, so that the path is not mistaken and the work progresses daily.

Thus, in Chan Buddhism, there are the *staff and shout*; in the Daoist gate, reliance on *pointing and transformation*; and in Confucian learning, observation and emulation are especially valued. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘The noble person discusses and practices with friends.’ The *Book of Rites* says: ‘To study alone without friends is to be isolated and ignorant.’ Even Confucius, the Supreme Sage, still worried over learning that was not discussed. Zixia, a distinguished disciple of the Apricot Altar, lamented that living in seclusion cut him off from hearing his faults. How can one do without a *Dao* companion?

Yet if one does not earnestly practice but merely gathers with friends, spending days discoursing on the profound and expounding on the wondrous, discussing the ancients and the present—this is what is called ‘mouth Chan’—what benefit does it bring to one’s body, mind, and learning? Thus, while cultivating the Dao values companions, it values even more self-discipline. Like attracts like, and kind gathers with kind—it lies within oneself, not in others!”

A Eulogy states: “Stones from other mountains can polish jade; friends aid one another, offering timely admonitions. Like gold in the crucible, a candle raised in darkness illuminates. Gathering long with virtuous companions, one transcends the dust and surpasses the common. Huiche asked: ‘The ancients spoke of entering the enclosure for nurturing, nine years of facing the wall—is there truth to this?’ Master Lei replied: ‘This pertains to refining destiny before refining nature, and only then is such practice employed. For if nature remains impure, the work of destiny may still harbor flaws. Master Wuyuan said: “Nine years” signifies the nine returns. “Facing the wall” does not mean seated meditation but rather single-minded focus, the congealing of spirit. The aim is to leave not a speck of dross, as if a towering wall stands before one—nothing is seen, all dharmas return to emptiness, and the infant is quietly nurtured in the womb of transformation.’

The Former Master said: ‘This practice, undertaken after the return, coagulation, and nurturing are complete, may seem secure, yet how few in antiquity endured its great exertions without faltering? Far better is the Supreme’s Mind School, where penetrating nature is itself penetrating destiny, where each attainment solidifies the next, accumulating little by little. Day by day, month by month, year by year—thus. Step by step, one returns to emptiness, advancing to the natural state, where liberation is instant, transformation immediate. Having reached the realm where even emptiness is shattered, one moves or rests at will—why labor in enclosures or face walls?’

According to the Master’s teaching, this aligns with Ancestor Bai’s words: ‘Life is as it is; death is as it is.’ The key lies in mastering oneself, for the work is simply to cultivate utmost sincerity without cease.”

In praise it is said:
“When nature is luminous, why face the wall?
The Supreme’s Mind School—destiny stands by nature.
Step by step, return to emptiness;
moment by moment, accumulate without cease.
Let life and death take their course—
how wondrous the mastery of the self!
Hui Che asked: ‘The ancients all speak of success as breaking through the crown to release the yang spirit—is this the principle?’
Master Lei replied: ‘This is what is called guiding the primordial yang. The methods of the Three Vehicles all proceed thus. Yet one must ensure it can emerge but does not, then refine the spirit to return to emptiness, refine emptiness to merge with the Dao, refine the Dao to unite with the natural. Hence the sayings of re-securing the crucible and cauldron, of re-establishing heaven and earth. Thus Purple Yang the Perfected One said:
*“Light behind the nape is still illusion;
clouds beneath the feet are not yet immortality.”*
Only when emptiness is shattered does one stop. This is the final great matter of the last move. If one proceeds thus, nature and destiny are split in two, hence the extra effort. Our Heavenly Immortals’ method begins with the nature school: each step taken is each step returned. When emptiness is cultivated to the point of no further return, refining the Dao to merge with the natural—only then is it complete. There is no need first to coalesce the yang spirit, then shatter it. Simply let one’s vast qi fill the cosmos, becoming one with the Great Void, without exit or entry. This is what is called *utmost greatness and firmness, nurtured directly without harm*—filling the space between heaven and earth. Thus the supreme Vehicle’s method is refining form, which is refining spirit and cultivating nature, and thus cultivating destiny. True emptiness yet wondrous existence; wondrous existence yet true emptiness. Therefore, when gathered, it forms shape; when scattered, it becomes qi. Both form and spirit are wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.’

In praise it is said:
Cultivating nature is cultivating destiny;
refining form is refining spirit.
When form and spirit are both wondrous,
nature and destiny are perfectly realized.
Why need fetal nurturance?
Roaming leisurely in the Jade Court.
The supreme wondrous secret—
merging with the Dao in truth.

Hui Che asked: ‘This Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar—is it the matter after returning the elixir? Is it necessary first to cultivate the returned elixir, then the golden elixir?’
Master Lei replied: ‘No. The so-called returned elixir is restoring the original elixir we inherently possess! For after the age of fifteen or sixteen, the true primordial is broken, and one’s essence and spirit daily diminish. Thus one must replenish it to the state before the true primordial was broken, and further restore the countenance of one’s birth. *Return* means gone and then come back—restoring one’s original Great Ultimate. Hence it is called the returned elixir. The methods of the Three Vehicles all require first cultivating the returned elixir, then advancing to the golden elixir. Our Supreme Mind Transmission, once the mysterious pass is opened, daily gathers, moment by moment refines, and instant by instant empties—thus gradually replenishing. Daily accumulation leads to daily replenishment; daily replenishment leads to daily fullness. Fullness upon fullness, sufficiency upon sufficiency—herein lies the returned elixir, and herein lies the golden elixir. This *fullness* is not the essence and spirit of the posterior heaven, but the one qi of primordial harmony. When the prior heaven is full, the posterior heaven naturally flourishes daily; when the posterior heaven flourishes, the prior heaven becomes even fuller! The single numinous origin of a person is born from the central qi of heaven and earth. That which endures through past and present is the central qi—the ancestral qi of the Great Ultimate, the progenitor of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Yet the Great Ultimate has both the Great Ultimate of the whole and the Great Ultimate of each thing. The Great Ultimate of the whole is the single Great Ultimate of heaven, earth, and the myriad beings. The Great Ultimate of each thing is the Great Ultimate possessed by each thing. This Great Ultimate is the blended name of principle and qi. Principle is the pattern of qi; qi is the generative force of principle. Master Cheng said: *“To speak of principle without qi is incomplete; to speak of qi without principle is unclear. To separate them is incorrect.”* Master Zhu said: *“Nature is principle; destiny is qi.”* Thus the Great Ultimate may be spoken of as principle, or as qi; as nature, or as destiny. From the moment of parental union, a single point descends into the Yellow Court and establishes itself—the Great Ultimate then divides into yin and yang, and creation begins! Yin and yang are essence and spirit; in heaven, they are the sun and moon. As Ancestor Bai said:
*“Sun and moon together make brightness.
Sun above and moon below make Change.
Sun and moon layered make the elixir.”*
If one nurtures one’s essence and spirit to unity, nature and destiny naturally endure. When nature and destiny endure, the foundation of the elixir is ever firm. The returned elixir returns the Great Ultimate of each thing, while the golden elixir returns the Great Ultimate of the whole! For cultivating virtue and cultivating life are but one matter. Exhausting principle and fully realizing nature to reach destiny—herein lies the golden elixir!’

In praise it is said:
Cultivating virtue and cultivating the body are but one matter.
Returned elixir and golden elixir—how could they have two meanings?
The sagely learning and immortal tradition aid one another from start to finish.
Exhausting nature to reach destiny—how could one not observe the *Appended Remarks*?

Hui Che asked: ‘What is the meaning of *blending transformation*?’
Master Lei replied: ‘The two words *blending transformation* are the wondrous secret of beginning and completion. The ancient masters said:
*“Forget form to nurture qi;
forget qi to nurture spirit;
forget spirit to nurture emptiness.”*
Thus, at the outset, one must lay down the myriad concerns. When the work reaches the point of release, one gradually enters the stage of *forgetting*—this is the completion of the beginning in blending transformation. The secret lies in inwardly and outwardly illuminating one’s body, mind, spirit, and qi, gathering them into one. Then, withdraw the mechanism, and naturally one gradually enters the realm of transformation.’

When the empty scene becomes lively and the subtle signs emerge within, the workings may involve welcoming, engaging, releasing, or gathering—all such operations must follow the spontaneous movement of the moment, responding naturally. Embrace it with stillness, transform it with oneness, and proceed until there is nothing left to forget; this is the sublime mystery of *blending transformation* at its completion.

As the Buddhist sutra says: *“Only this one is real; the other two are not true—hence it is called the non-dual Dharma gate.”*

In praise it is said:
The wonder of *blending transformation* lies chiefly in the three forgettings.
When there is nothing left to forget, oneness illumines in stillness.
Flowing with nature’s course, one mirrors the emptiness of space.
When the work is perfected to the point of dissolution, a smile meets all encounters.

Hui Che said: “I wish to hear more of the subtle essence within!”
Master Lei replied: “The essence of *blending transformation* defies description. As the *Book of Changes* says: *‘Harmonize one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon, one’s order with the four seasons, and one’s auspices with ghosts and spirits. Precede Heaven and Heaven will not oppose; follow Heaven and uphold its timing—then one approaches this.’* My master said: *‘The heart-transmission of the Heavenly Immortal’s practice begins with laying down the myriad concerns, so the body naturally becomes still and empty. In Heaven and in the abyss, there is no moment of separation. Perfect emptiness, perfect stillness, perfect clarity, perfect harmony—what is inner, what is outer? What is being, what is non-being? The ceaseless transformations of life are all entrusted to suchness. The wondrous function returns—thus, thus.’*

If one does not begin by laying down the myriad concerns, the six senses are tempted by external dust, the six roots stir within, and whether from inner accumulation or outer contact, body, mind, and intent cannot be at peace. If the heart and nature are unsettled, how can the work take root? Thus, the *Great Learning* says: *‘Only when one knows where to rest can there be stability.’* To seek stability, one must first clarify where to rest. To know where to rest, one must discern the highest good—then one knows where to rest.

Master Cheng said: *‘When the heart has a master, it remains unmoved.’* When the heart has a master, the heart is stable and the spirit at ease. The Way of learning and inquiry is nothing other than seeking the heart that has been lost.

When qi becomes still and thoughts vanish, the body ascends into the imagery of emptiness and non-being, nature is serene and emotions forgotten, and one’s radiance shines forth—then in Heaven and in the abyss, all is contained within a single awakening. This is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls the state *‘before arousal.’* Yet this realm is attained only in stillness; one may lack mastery when in motion. Thus, stillness and activity must be cultivated together—hence my master said: *‘There is no moment of separation.’* The four qualities of emptiness, stillness, clarity, and harmony must be present in both stillness and activity to be true skill and genuine learning. Then what is inner, what is outer? What is being, what is non-being? The ceaseless transformations of Heaven’s mechanism are all entrusted to suchness alone.

Suchness is without above or below, without movement or stillness, without direction or location, without inner or outer. The wondrous function of the Heavenly Immortal is no more than this.

Observe how the *Great Learning* proceeds from *‘illuminating virtue’* to *‘resting in the highest good,’* and from *‘investigation of things’* to *‘bringing peace to the world.’* The *Doctrine of the Mean* begins with *‘vigilance’* and *‘fear,’* culminates in *‘Heaven and Earth in their places’* and *‘the nurturing of the myriad things,’* and concludes with *‘the burden of Heaven—soundless, scentless.’* All these practices unite stillness and activity, for the substance itself is the work of learning.

Later scholars, unwilling to reflect deeply on their own body and heart, read superficially and may even expound or explain, treating it as mere literary ornament or memorized knowledge, entirely disconnected from body and heart. Though they read, they have not truly read. Some, upon encountering works of the Daoist and Confucian traditions, dismiss them as impractical talk—how many truly devote themselves to the work of nature and destiny?

If one truly applies effort to one’s own body, heart, nature, and destiny, one will recognize that the true learning of the sages is the very practice of the Heavenly Immortal. Seeing through the practice of the Heavenly Immortal, one knows it is indeed the learning of the sages—not to be compared with the Daoist arts of *ziwu*, *lead*, and *mercury*.

The Dao speaks of the *Golden Elixir*; the Confucians speak of the *Supreme Ultimate*. What engenders transformation is the Supreme Ultimate, and the Supreme Ultimate is the primordial limit. What enacts transformation is yin and yang, and yin and yang arise from the Supreme Ultimate. Heaven, Earth, and all beings are born of nothing but the Supreme Ultimate and yin-yang. The Supreme Ultimate generates Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth move yin and yang. Thus the four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born, and humans are but one among the myriad beings.

Each being establishes its own Supreme Ultimate—this is what is meant by *‘each thing embodies one Supreme Ultimate.’* The Supreme Ultimate and yin-yang are present in every being. Thus, within the six directions, all is the flowing of the Supreme Ultimate and yin-yang. Since humans exist within the six directions, their bodies, inner and outer, are nothing but yin and yang. Yet the Supreme Ultimate is the root of our ceaseless life.

The Supreme Ultimate transforms into yin and yang, yin and yang move the Supreme Ultimate, cycling endlessly, transforming without cease—unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years. That it remains unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years is because it has a master within. What is this master? The heart of Heaven. Humans, formed by the qi of Heaven and Earth, receive the heart of Heaven as their own heart. Receiving the heart of Heaven as one’s heart, one should embody the heart of Heaven and fulfill it in all things. When my heart fully embodies the heart of Heaven, only then can I stand alongside Heaven and Earth as a third.

As the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *‘Only when one fully realizes one’s nature can one fully realize the nature of others; only when one fully realizes the nature of others can one fully realize the nature of things.’*”

"...then one may stand alongside Heaven and Earth as a third!" Such is the way humans may seize the transformative power of Heaven and Earth. Yet this transformative power is nothing other than ceaseless generation. To generate is to transform, and to transform is to generate—left entirely to nature, I cannot partake in it! If one entrusts the totality of generation and transformation to suchness, then Heaven and Earth intermingle in misty fusion, and the myriad things naturally attain purity. Thus did Qupengtou say: *"Neither existence nor non-existence is established—truth abides between existence and non-existence."* This is the true learning of fully realizing one’s nature and fulfilling one’s destiny.

My master further said: *"From the vast expanse of the celestial realm to the minute intricacies of a speck of dust, all is encompassed within the One Heart. Placing the heart in this One, the work of fusion is perfected, and the true is made whole."* For whether vast as the celestial realm or minute as a speck of dust, all lies within the One Heart. Thus, by fixing the heart in this One, the power of fusion is complete, and the true is made whole.

Yet this is not merely the Daoist teaching of fusion. Even in Confucian practice, spiritual transformation is the ultimate attainment. As the *Doctrine of the Mean* states: *"Minor virtue flows like a stream; great virtue is profoundly transformative."* It also says: *"Movement leads to change; change leads to transformation. Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can effect transformation."* Mencius said: *"To be great and transformative is to be sagely; to be sagely in a way beyond comprehension is to be spirit-like."* Both Confucian and Daoist practices must attain spiritual transformation to reach their ultimate end.

In praise it is said:
*Wondrous is this supreme principle, where sagely learning converges.*
*Spiritual transformation, perfect fusion—profound and subtle, beyond ancient discourse.*
*Unobstructed in emptiness and fullness, the supreme Dao is embraced.*
*Neither partial nor mutable, we reverently honor the Mountain of Confucius.*

Huiche said: "According to all that has been said, sagely learning and profound learning share the same principle. Why then did the former worthies all reject Buddhism and Daoism as inapplicable to the governance of the world and the state? If they were indeed inapplicable, how is it that the Three Teachings have stood like a tripod in the world for over a thousand years without one being extinguished?"

Master Lei replied: "Laozi, Śākyamuni, and Confucius were all sages. The Ways of the Three Teachings are all the Dao. The Dao has no dual principles; the teachings are divided into three. The followers of the Three Teachings are all human. Every person possesses this heart and nature, this heavenly principle. There are no dual principles, no dual hearts. The Confucians say: *cultivate the heart and nurture the nature.* The Daoists say: *refine the heart and temper the nature.* The Buddhists say: *illuminate the heart and perceive the nature.* The Three Teachings all apply true effort to the heart and nature, each striving to reach its ultimate end. Thus, they have stood like a tripod through the ages—what is called *different paths leading to the same destination.*

For our own learning, we must possess a discerning eye and establish an unwavering resolve, knowing clearly what enterprise we pursue. Confucians must study until they attain the station of Confucius and Yan Hui. Those who follow Buddhism or Daoism must practice until they reach the attainment of Śākyamuni or Laozi. Once this resolve is firmly established and coupled with genuine effort, one will naturally progress day by day and month by month, attaining spiritual comprehension and grasping the subtleties of one’s chosen path. The greatest danger lies in fickleness—changing course with each dawn and dusk, being swayed by novelty, abandoning one’s own goodness to emulate others, and recklessly passing judgment on the right and wrong of past and present.

For only with a measure of effort does one gain a measure of learning; only with a measure of learning does one gain a measure of insight; only with a measure of insight does one comprehend a measure of the ancients’ realm. Without such insight, to rashly offer criticism is to regret it later when one’s learning advances and insight deepens—by then, it will be too late.

The statement that *'Buddhism and Daoism cannot be applied to the governance of the world and the state'* may only be uttered by sages and worthies. We ordinary people must never lightly repeat it. Why? Only those with the true learning of sages and worthies, who can genuinely apply it to the governance of the world and the state, are qualified to say that Buddhism and Daoism cannot be so applied. As for those of shallow understanding and limited experience, who cannot even govern their own bodies and minds, how can they govern the world and the state? If one cannot govern the world and the state, how can one question the applicability of Buddhism and Daoism?

Moreover, that Confucianism can be applied to the governance of the world and the state does not mean that all Confucians can so apply it. The true learning of Confucianism, from the investigation of things to the governance of peace, is entirely for the purpose of fully realizing oneself and others. It must extend to the peace of all under Heaven, ensuring that not a single thing fails to find its proper place. What immense power! What monumental achievement! How easily is such a matter discussed?"

Let us first thoroughly comprehend our own mind and nature, then apply and verify this understanding in our endeavors—only then can we see whether it is truly applicable. Otherwise, even if one wears the robes and cap of a Confucian all one’s life, one may still fail to apply it even among family, between father and son, or among brothers—how much less can it be applied to all under Heaven?

As the ancients said:
*"Buddhism speaks of compassion,
Daoism speaks of resonance,
Confucianism speaks of loyalty and reciprocity—
The Three Teachings originally share one mind.
When the essence of the mind is fully realized,
what distinction remains between the three?
And what need is there to speak of one?"*

In praise it is said:
The ultimate principle is one, yet its paths are three.
Loyalty and reciprocity, compassion,
resonance intertwined.
Mind answers mind,
all things bear and contain.
