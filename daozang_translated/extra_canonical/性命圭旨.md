**The Supreme Principles of Cultivating Both Nature and Life: The Primordial Collection – The Daoist Teachings (Illustrated by the Three Sages)**

The Supreme Sage Fuxi drew the Eight Trigrams to instruct humanity, that for ten thousand generations hence, all might know the Way of nurturing life. The Master of Broad Accomplishment said to the Yellow Emperor: *"The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang is blazing and radiant. The radiance blazes forth from the earth; the stillness emerges from the heavens. I have guided you to ascend above the great brightness—there lies the source of utmost yang. I have led you to enter the gate of profound obscurity—there lies the source of utmost yin."* The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and said: *"The Master of Broad Accomplishment is indeed the heavens."*

The Duke of Zhou, in his *Yi* divination, said: *"The noble person labors diligently all day."* Confucius, in his commentary, said: *"To labor diligently all day is to return again and again to the Dao."*

Now, as for the Dao:
It establishes heaven and earth and nurtures the myriad things—this is called the Dao.
It upholds the sun and moon and generates the Five Agents—this is called the Dao.
It is more numerous than the sands of the Ganges—this is called the Dao.
It stands alone, without a single companion—this is called the Dao.
It enters the primordial chaos and returns to the profound depths—this is called the Dao.
It skillfully gathers the workings of creation and transcends the sacred and the mundane—this is called the Dao.
Before signs appear in the present moment, it suddenly becomes spiritually efficacious—this is called the Dao.
Before one’s eyes, life and death are clearly distinguished, yet none can escape—this is called the Dao.
Dwelling in lowliness and filth, it is supremely noble—this is called the Dao.
Abiding in darkness and obscurity, it is utterly luminous—this is called the Dao.
It is finer than a mote of dust—this is called the Dao.
It encompasses heaven and earth—this is called the Dao.
It moves from non-being into being—this is called the Dao.
It makes one a buddha or an immortal—this is called the Dao.

The Buddhist scriptures, in fifty-four hundred and eight scrolls, cannot exhaust its reaches.
The *Doctrine of the Mean*, in thirty-three chapters, cannot fathom its depths.
The *Dao De Jing*, in over five thousand words, cannot attain its ultimate expression.

What, then, is the Dao?
In a single word, it may be defined: *qi*.

Originally, the One *qi* coiled and gathered, profound and obscure, unfathomable and mysterious, teeming with activity, containing the most wondrous spirit—this is the Great Unity, the beginning before the beginning. This beginning is called the Dao, and thus it is said to have no beginning.

As for the beginning of heaven and earth:
The One *qi* stirred and surged, emptiness opened and closed, the feminine and masculine responded to one another, black and white intermingled and congealed, being and non-being shot forth upon each other, in a state of primordial chaos, supremely empty and sagely. It embraced the primordial and contained the spirit, its numinous transformations wondrous and indistinct, suddenly manifesting—this is the Great Simplicity, the beginning of the beginning. This beginning is called *"the Dao gives birth to the One,"* and it is named the Primordial Beginning.

As for the Great Ultimate of heaven and earth:
The One *qi* divided, the True Lord self-separated, intermingling and arraying, the myriad spirits reverently guarded. Yin and yang were distinguished—this is the Great Ultimate, called *"the One gives birth to the Two,"* and it is named the Primal Yellow.

Once yin and yang were distinguished, heaven and earth took their places, and humanity was nurtured—this is called *"the Two give birth to the Three,"* and it is named the Primordial Chaos.

The pure aspect of yang ascended and shone brilliantly, and thus the sun, moon, and stars reside there. Therefore, heaven revolves to the left, and the Three Luminaries revolve to the right. The pure aspect of yang soared upward and gathered in the yang, and thus wind and clouds stirred, and thunder and rain arose.

The turbid aspect of yin was heavy and sank to the earth, and thus the seas and mountains were established, and the Five Grains and plants flourished. Therefore, cliffs and peaks emit clouds, and mountains and marshes communicate *qi*. When the *qi* of yin and yang are blocked and do not flow, snow and frost congeal, and ice forms.

The turbid aspect of yin accumulated and froze, descending and solidifying, hidden in dark caverns and deep recesses, and thus the Five Grains and Eight Stones are interspersed. At the center of heaven and earth, where the upright *qi* of yin and yang intersect, the sages, immortals, buddhas, common folk, the worthy and foolish, the long-lived and short-lived—all are governed there. Birth from wombs, eggs, moisture, and transformation—none cease there. This is the Six Directions, called *"the Three give birth to the myriad things."*

Humans receive the *qi* of intermingling yin and yang and are born, growing until the age of sixteen. At that time, the yang of the nine threes is pure. Is this not the great person of supreme virtue?

Yet suddenly, one morning, the reckoning for the debt of primordial chaos arrives. Day by day, a hole is chiseled away, and the yang of the nine threes gallops and stumbles, retreating into the six twos. From this, *qian* can no longer remain pure and is broken by *li*; *kun* has something to contain and is filled by *kan*.

As for the sagely and spiritually perfected person:
They are able to know how the Dao’s substance divides into the Great Ultimate.
They are able to know how the root of life and death begins.
They are able to know how *qian* and *kun*, yin and yang, ride upon each other.
They are able to know how the mysterious and the virile of heaven and earth unite.
Thus, they emulate the body of *qian* and *kun*, imitate the function of *kan* and *li*, wield the handle of yin and yang, pass through the barrier of life and death, extract the yang from *kan*, and fill the yin in *li*. Once the yin in *li* is filled, it returns to pure whiteness as *qian*. At this time, the primordial *qian* is restored, the primordial chaos is made whole, the source of one’s birth is preserved, and the endowment of heaven is fulfilled—this is a complete and undivided person.

Then, with further effort above, diligently advancing without ceasing, the elixir is completed, the sacred embryo is perfected, and the true person emerges. Once the true person appears, their transformations are boundless, their concealment and manifestation unfathomable. To ride alongside Zhong, Lü, Wang, and Ma—what difficulty would there be?

Alas! The people of the world do not understand this Dao. In their prime, they do not know how to nurture; in decline, they do not know how to save. Day after day, their yang is exhausted, and their yin becomes pure—they die and become ghosts.

Thus, the True Person of Purple Yang said:
*"Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time passes easily. Who can fathom the length of one’s life? How can one escape karmic retribution? If one does not awaken early, one will only resign oneself to awaiting the end. If, at the final moment, a single thought goes astray, one will immediately fall into the evil paths of the Three Realms, where one may wander for kalpas without hope of escape. At that time, though one may regret, what use will it be?"*

Thus, the sages of the Three Teachings opened the gate of expedient means through the study of nature and life, teaching people to cultivate and refine themselves to transcend birth and death.

The teaching of Confucianism instructs one to follow nature and life to return to the workings of creation—its Way is universal.
The teaching of Chan Buddhism instructs one to transcend nature and life to surpass great enlightenment—its meaning is lofty.
The teaching of Laozi instructs one to cultivate nature and life to attain longevity—its aim is urgent.
Though the teachings are divided into three, their Way is one.

The sagely teaching of Confucianism says:
*"Find repose in your resting place, revere its stillness.
The trigram *Gen* is its stillness, stillness in its proper place.
Bright and reverent in stillness, abiding in perfect goodness.
The center radiates harmony, standing upright in its proper position.
Thought does not transgress its bounds, standing without shifting one’s ground.
Dwelling in the world’s broadest dwelling, standing in the world’s central position,
walking the world’s great Way.
All-pervading within, purely and perfectly good.
Sincerity fills the chest, joy resides within the heart’s square inch.
The abode of spirit and brightness, the gate of Dao and virtue—
living and vibrant, joy abides within.
Sincere in benevolence, profound as an abyss, vast as heaven.
The world returns to benevolence, withdrawing into secrecy,
preserving the boundless sky of thought, the realm of unknowing.
Though difficult to recount in full, in essence, it is nothing but the Way of nature and life."*

The mysterious teaching of Daoism says:
*"The Gate of the Mysterious Female, the root of heaven and earth,
the place of bodily birth, the pass of returning to life,
the mother of the Golden Elixir, the aperture of the Mysterious Pass,
the place of congealment, the root of breath.
The altar of *jia* and *yi*, the gate of *wu* and *ji*,
the heart-source, the sea of nature, the numinous palace, the numinous terrace, Penglai Isle.
The cinnabar tripod, the inverted moon furnace, the chamber of spirit,
the qi cavern, the earthen cauldron, the Valley Spirit, the numinous root,
the handle, the realm of *kan* and *li*’s union,
the ancestor of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes,
the place where birth and death hold no sway, the mechanism unseen by ghosts and spirits.
Though difficult to recount in full, in essence, it is nothing but the Way of nature and life."*

The Chan teaching of Buddhism says:
*"The non-dual Dharma-gate, the profound Dharma-realm,
the Treasury of the Void, the Sea of Quiescence, the True Ground,
the Gate of Total Retention, the Other Shore, the Pure Land,
the true realm, the mind of the Other, the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
The Tathāgata Treasury, Śāriputra, the Ground of the Bodhisattva,
the Treasury of Light, the Ocean of Perfect Enlightenment,
the Shore of Prajñā, the City of the Dharma King,
the West, Heaven, the Void, the True Ultimate,
‘this,’ samādhi, the Ocean of the Flower Treasury,
the Gate of Dhāraṇī, the Unmoving Bodhimanda,
the Ground of Pāramitā—difficult to recount in full.
In essence, it is nothing but the Way of nature and life."*

Confucianism says: *"Preserve the heart and nurture nature."*
Daoism says: *"Cultivate the heart and refine nature."*
Buddhism says: *"Illumine the heart and see nature."*
Heart and nature are the fundamental substance.

The Confucian *"holding to the center"* is holding to the center of this fundamental substance.
The Daoist *"guarding the center"* is guarding the center of this fundamental substance.
The Buddhist *"emptiness within"* is the fundamental substance’s inherent emptiness and openness.
The Daoist *"attaining the One"* is attaining the One of this fundamental substance.
The Buddhist *"returning to the One"* is returning to the One of this fundamental substance.
The Confucian *"unity that runs through"* is using the One of this fundamental substance to thread all things.

From this, I know:
*Without holding to the center and the unity that runs through, could one become a sage like Confucius?
Without guarding the center and attaining the One, could one become profound like Laozi?
Without emptiness within and returning to the One, could one become enlightened like Śākyamuni?*

Only this fundamental substance.
Because it is empty and without trace, it is forcibly called *"the center."*
Because it reveals the slightest sign, it is forcibly called *"the One."*
Spoken of as the center, it is the repository of the One.
The One is the function of the center.

Thus, heaven attains this and becomes heaven, earth attains this and becomes earth, humanity attains this and becomes human.
And the great Way of heaven, earth, and humanity originates from this.
The emperor attains this and becomes emperor, the sovereign attains this and becomes sovereign, the king attains this and becomes king.
And the great Way of emperors, sovereigns, and kings originates from this.
The sage attains this and becomes sage, the profound attains this and becomes profound, the enlightened attains this and becomes enlightened.
And the great Way of sages, the profound, and the enlightened originates from this.

Those emperors and sovereigns who attained the Way include Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.
Those officials and recluses who attained the Way include Laozi, Zhuangzi, and the Guardian of the Pass.
Those nobles who attained the Way include Zhang Liang and the Prince of Huainan.
Those who attained the Way in mountain fastnesses include Zhongli Quan, Lü Dongbin, and Chen Tuan.

The Way in heaven and earth—those who became immortals and buddhas—are too numerous to count.
Upon perusing the *Comprehensive Biographies of Immortals*, I learned that since ancient times, those who ascended lightly have numbered over a hundred thousand, and those who ascended with their households have exceeded eight thousand.
Some were extraordinary, like Wang Ziqiao riding a phoenix or Qin Gao steering a carp.
Some were long-lived, like Li Tuo at eight hundred years or Anqi at three thousand.
Some remained in the world, preserving their forms; others wearied of the world and departed through *shijie*.
Some, having attained the Way, concealed themselves, seeking only their own benefit and refusing to leave their names in the world—how could they all be recounted?

Thus, in the deep mountains and wondrous grottoes, there has never been a generation without such people.
Some conceal themselves, some reveal themselves—who could know them all?
The kings and great men of old humbled themselves before scholars, simply because the Way was present in them.

Master Zhou said:
*"Between heaven and earth, the most revered is the Dao, the most noble is virtue, the rarest is humanity.
And the rarest among humanity is one who embodies Dao and virtue."*

The ancients said:
*"The human body is hard to obtain—now you have obtained it.
The great Dao is hard to understand—now you have understood it.
If you do not cross over in this life, in which life will you cross over?"*

The people of the world do not understand that this body is illusory, merely a temporary aggregation of the four great elements—
fleeting as bubbles on water, flashing like sparks from stone.
Though human life is said to span a hundred years, by the time one reaches seventy, it is already rare.

Here the fragile, perishable body is daily entangled in boundless, unfathomable affairs. Should a single breath fail to come, one suddenly departs forever; before life’s end is declared, the true spirit has already perished into another shell. At such a moment, though one may have occupied the highest rank, enjoyed a thousand bushels of emolument, possessed priceless pearls in abundance, and filled one’s chambers with beauties to topple a city—all must be cast aside, for none of it is truly one’s own. Only the karmic deeds of one’s past accompany one on the journey. Thus it is said: *“A thousand things will not go with you; only karma follows the body.”* The *Huiguang Ji* states: *“A thousand-year iron tree blooms more easily than regaining a human body once lost.”* The *Wu Zhen Pian* asks: *“Try piling gold as high as mountains—can impermanence be bought off?”* Lü Chunyang says: *“After ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, one obtains a human form; know that it arises from causes planted in past lives. Awaken swiftly, emerge from the sea of delusion, and do not let the wheel of rebirth bring you suffering.”* Zhang Ziyang warns: *“Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind; in the six paths of rebirth, do not blame heaven.”* These words from the three summer months—can one not tremble and awaken?

If one wishes to escape the cycle of rebirth and not be ensnared by the world’s nets, nothing surpasses the cultivation of the Golden Elixir, which serves as the numinous ladder to ascend to heaven and the path to transcend the mundane. This Way is utterly simple and easy; even the dullest and most ignorant may practice it and swiftly ascend to the realm of sages. Yet why is it that those who cultivate the truth set their minds on the Dao but lack single-minded devotion, or devote themselves single-mindedly but lack diligent perseverance? Thus, though learners are many, those who succeed are few. The *Book of Documents* says: *“To know it is not difficult; to practice it is difficult indeed.”* The *Daoist Canon* states: *“The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, practices it diligently.”* If one hears but does not practice, how can the Dao be accomplished? Chen Niuwan says: *“In my past cultivation, I obtained the true formula and never ceased my efforts day or night. One morning, when my practice was complete, none knew it—yet all around me became halls of night-shining pearls.”* Ma Danyang says: *“The debt to my teacher is deep and heavy, impossible to repay; I vow to encircle the walls and refine the true until death.”* These two masters, mindful that the matter of life and death is great and impermanence swift, roused a courageous and resolute mind, distinguishing the power of diligent progress. Had they not established this great resolve, how could they have escaped the cage and soared beyond the heavens?

Lü Zu has said: *“Three years of toil bring a thousand kalpas of joy.”* For heaven may at times collapse, earth may at times sink, mountains may at times be cast down, and seas may at times dry up. Only after the Dao is accomplished does one ride a flying dragon, mount purple mists, soar beyond the heavens, and roam carefree through the void. Then, one’s years cannot be counted, one’s life cannot be constrained, and the true and constant essence knows no end. Looking back upon the pleasures of the world, what joy compares to this? As the *Daode Jing* states: *“Though jade and jasper precede a team of four horses, it is not equal to sitting and advancing in this Dao.”* This is the reason for the composition of this discourse.

**On Nature and Life**

Of all learning, none is greater than that of nature and life. The discourse on nature and life has long been obscured in the world. What is *nature*? It is the primordial true suchness, the single luminous spirit. What is *life*? It is the primordial supreme essence, the single qi in its misty swirling. Yet where there is nature, there is life; where there is life, there is nature. Nature and life were originally inseparable. Only when viewed in heaven is it called *life*; in humans, it is called *nature*. In truth, nature and life are not two. Moreover, nature cannot stand without life, and life cannot exist without nature—thus, the principle of nature and life is fundamentally one. As the *Yi Jing* says: *“The Dao of Qian transforms and changes, each rectifying its nature and life.”* The *Zhongyong* states: *“What heaven commands is called life.”* This is what is meant.

Yet the esoteric tradition takes qi as life and makes the cultivation of life its宗, establishing its teachings on seeking the mysterious in the watery palace. Thus, it speaks in detail of life but briefly of nature—this is to not know nature, and in the end, it is also to not know life. The Chan school takes spirit as nature and makes the cultivation of nature its宗, establishing its teachings on cultivating samādhi in the *li gong*. Thus, it speaks in detail of nature but briefly of life—this is to not know life, and in the end, it is also to not know nature. How could they know that nature and life are originally not separate, and that Daoism and Buddhism are fundamentally without duality? Though spirit and qi have two functions, nature and life must be cultivated together.

The learning of the worthy focuses on preserving the mind to nurture nature and cultivating the body to establish life. The learning of the sage is to fully realize nature and thereby reach life. Nature is the beginning of spirit; spirit arises from nature, yet nature is not originally spirit, for it is that by which spirit becomes numinous. Life is the beginning of qi; qi arises from life, yet life is not originally qi, for it is that by which qi is generated. The essence within the body is still and unmoving. As it is firm, strong, centered, and upright, pure and refined, it abides—this is where nature resides and the root of life. The spirit within the mind is responsive and immediately penetrates. As the six emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, aversion, and desire—abide, this is where life resides and the pivot of nature. Nature is the mind, and within the single spirit, it shines brightly. Life is the body, and within the single qi, it circulates. Thus, the body and mind are the dwelling of essence and spirit, while essence and spirit are the root of nature and life.

Nature’s transformations depend on the mind; life’s transformations depend on the body. Understanding and knowledge emerge from the mind. Thoughts and contemplations are the mind’s servitude of nature. Actions and responses emerge from the body. Speech, silence, seeing, and hearing are the body’s burden on life. If life is burdened by the body, there is birth and death. If nature is enslaved by the mind, there is going and coming. With birth and death, one cannot reach life. With going and coming, one cannot fully realize nature. Thus, throughout heaven and earth, all is vital qi, assisting in the two realms and transforming and nurturing the ten thousand things. Is this not the ceaseless circulation of life?

For the principle of life is inherent in destiny. Throughout heaven and earth, all is numinous awareness; its luminous radiance above and below illumines sun and moon. That which is not yet nature yet can nature my nature is the inception of nature. That which is not yet destiny yet can destiny my destiny is the inception of destiny. The celestial aperture is round and stores nature; the terrestrial aperture is square and stores destiny. Receiving the empty and numinous to complete nature, it stands at the center of heaven and earth to establish destiny. When nature is complete and destiny established, within them abides spirit. Destiny’s stem is primordial qi; nature’s root is primordial spirit. Spirit is concealed in the heart; qi is gathered in the body. Within them abides the Dao.

Nature comprises the nature of qi and material form, and the nature endowed by heaven. Destiny comprises the destiny of predetermined allotment, and the destiny of form and qi. The noble person cultivates the nature endowed by heaven and overcomes the nature of qi and material form; cultivates the destiny of form and qi, and entrusts the destiny of predetermined allotment. Spoken of separately, they are two; spoken of together, they are one. Within them abides principle.

Thus spirit does not depart from qi, nor qi from spirit. When the spirit and qi of my body unite, then the nature and destiny of my body become manifest. Nature does not depart from destiny, nor destiny from nature. When the nature and destiny of my body unite, then the nature that is not yet nature and the destiny that is not yet destiny of my body become manifest. The nature that is not yet nature and the destiny that is not yet destiny are my true nature and destiny. My true nature and destiny are the true nature and destiny of heaven and earth, and also the true nature and destiny of empty space.

Therefore the sage and the worthy uphold precepts, concentration, and wisdom to empty the heart; refine essence, qi, and spirit to preserve the body. When the body is preserved, the foundation of destiny is eternally firm; when the heart is empty, the substance of nature is ever luminous. When nature is ever luminous, there is neither coming nor going; when destiny is eternally firm, what death or birth can there be? Moreover, that which dies and departs is merely the physical form. Yet my true nature and destiny—pervading day and night, matching heaven and earth, penetrating past and present—how could they ever be extinguished?

I have observed this in plants and trees: returning to the root and recovering destiny, nature abides within. When nature becomes spirit, it flowers. When flowers become fruit, destiny abides within. From the spirit within form to enter the nature within spirit—this is called returning to the root and recovering destiny.

Again, I have compared it to the union of male and female: when a single point of goodness descends into the womb, qi unites with it to become destiny, and nature is immediately stored within. This is the interplay of one yin and one yang, a single point falling into the center of the Yellow Center to complete nature. Is this not the wondrous union and congealment of the unfathomable spirit? This is called the wondrous union of nature and destiny.

Alas, the way of wondrous union is not understood. Those who cultivate the world neglect destiny and, moreover, fail to comprehend the subtleties of following nature—how could they refine it? If not drifting into wild abandon, they fall into empty stillness, ignorant of destiny—where will they ultimately return? Those who cultivate destiny neglect nature and, moreover, fail to comprehend the effort of creating destiny—how could they preserve it? If not clinging to action, they fall into non-doing. Ignorant of nature—how can they escape the kalpas?

Even the founders of the Two Teachings—were they originally like this?

I have heard that Śākyamuni, born in the West, also attained the Way of the Golden Elixir—this is the dual cultivation of nature and destiny, the supreme vehicle of the Dharma, called the Golden Immortal. Lü Zu likewise said: "To know only nature and not destiny is the foremost malady of cultivation. If one cultivates only the ancestral nature and not the Elixir, even after ten thousand kalpas the yin spirit will struggle to attain sagehood."

How could it be merely like those today who practice guiding and pulling, taking the bodily form for nature and destiny? Or merely like those who refine spirit and qi, mistaking spirit and qi for nature and destiny? Or even like those who cultivate nature and destiny, yet take nature and destiny as nature and destiny? All these not only fail to benefit nature and destiny but indeed harm them. Failing to grasp the true essence of nature and destiny—how lamentable!

Thus, I have often reasoned: while in the mother’s womb, one’s breath and convergence depend on the mother’s nature and destiny, not one’s own. Only after emerging from the womb and severing the umbilical cord does one possess one’s own nature and destiny—yet even this is not the true, eternal nature and destiny. It is within this self-possessed nature and destiny that one must nurture the primordial visage of Qian, revealing the spark of true numinosity. Form clings to form, and form does not decay; spirit clings to nature, and spirit does not perish. Know nature and fulfill nature; fulfill nature and reach destiny. This is what is called the fundamental substance of emptiness, without end. Though heaven and earth may crumble, this does not—it is that which can reestablish nature and destiny, remaking the cosmos.

Thus, if Daoists do not understand this, they are called heterodox schools; if Buddhists do not understand this, they are called external paths. How then could they harmonize with the virtue of heaven and earth and unite with the Great Void as one body? Alas! At this point, the discourse on nature and destiny leaves nothing unsaid.

The Discourse on Life and Death

All beings cherish life and dread death, yet remain ignorant of their true nature. Whence does life arise? Whither does death depart? They spend their days in frantic striving, only to grievously violate the Way of life, never attaining true freedom. Thus, after death, they drift in boundless uncertainty, failing to break through the gate of death and instead falling into the cycle of rebirth.

For this reason, immortals and buddhas appear in the world, urgently proclaiming the great causal matter, guiding beings to know their origin and destination, and gradually leading them out of the苦海 of birth and death. The *Yi Jing* states: *"Trace beginnings to their end."* Thus, the discourse on life and death reveals the beginningless beginning, provisionally named the primordial Qian, which is the original wondrous awakening; and the endless end, provisionally named the shore of the Dao, which is the unconditioned nirvana.

Life is but life, yet that by which it lives lies herein; death is but death, yet that by which it does not die also lies herein. Those who remain ignorant of this invariably cling to life and perish with death, sinking into evil destinies without respite.

In life, it is the eighth consciousness, the ālaya-vijñāna, that presides; in death, it is also the eighth consciousness that presides. When rebirth occurs, this consciousness arrives first; when the body is abandoned, this consciousness departs last. Hence it is said: *"Departing last, arriving first, it acts as the master."*

The sutra verse states: *"Good karma cools from below, evil karma cools from above; both converge at the heart and are simultaneously relinquished."* At this moment, it is like a live turtle shedding its shell or a living crab plunged into boiling water—earth, water, fire, and wind each disperse in their own way. Once the spirit departs the form, the world appears as a splash of ink, with no distinction between east and west, up and down. Only at the place of karmic affinity does a deluded light appear.

Seeing the luminous form, perception arises; thoughts flow, and desire becomes the seed. Absorbing these thoughts as the embryo, it enters the mother’s womb, receiving qi and assuming form. The qi instantly possesses the four great elements and gradually forms the sense organs; the mind instantly possesses the four skandhas and gradually develops the various consciousnesses. After ten months, the fetus is complete, and at term, it emerges—earth overturns, heaven inverts, the breaking of the amniotic sac startles all, as if stumbling from a mountain peak. The head hangs down while the feet press upward, and with a single cry, the celestial true essence settles into the ancestral aperture.

By day, it resides in the two eyes and conceals itself in the Mud Pill Palace; by night, it lurks in the two kidneys and stores itself in the Cinnabar Crucible. Milk nourishes the five viscera, while qi surges through the six bowels. The bones are as soft as silk, the flesh as smooth as maltose—this is the perfection of essence. The gaze is steady without blinking, the breath is even without rasp—this is the perfection of harmony. Here, one is crimson within primordial chaos, purely tranquil and without knowledge, belonging to the hexagram *Kun*, the Receptive.

From one to three years of age, the primordial qi grows by sixty-four *zhu*, and the first yang arises in the hexagram *Fu*, the Return. By five years, the primordial qi grows another sixty-four *zhu*, and the second yang arises in *Lin*, the Approach. By eight years, it grows another sixty-four *zhu*, and the third yang arises in *Tai*, Peace. By ten years, another sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi accumulates, and the fourth yang arises in *Dazhuang*, Great Strength. By thirteen, another sixty-four *zhu* is added, and the fifth yang arises in *Guai*, Resolution. By sixteen, the primordial qi grows by another sixty-four *zhu*, completing the six yangs in *Qian*, the Creative. One has thus stolen the three hundred sixty *zhu* of true qi from heaven and earth, along with the twenty-four *zhu* of ancestral qi from one’s parents, totaling three hundred eighty-four *zhu*—the full measure of a *jin*, completing the alchemy of the celestial revolution.

At this time, pure yang is fully established, and the slightest trace of yin has yet to arise. Essence and qi are abundant and replete; with the guidance of a master, the cultivation of nature and life can succeed at once. From this point onward, the stirring of desire causes the primordial qi to leak. Without restraint or moderation, one indulges without end. Thus, from sixteen to twenty-four years of age, sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi are depleted, corresponding to the hexagram *Gou*, Encounter. The first yin arises, and all things become manifest. Simplicity scatters, and though one has not strayed far from the root, the warning of frost’s return is already apparent. Yet if one diligently cultivates, this is still the "not far from the Return."

By thirty-two, another sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi are lost, corresponding to *Dun*, Retreat. The second yin gradually grows, and the power of yang wanes. Desires and anxieties swarm, and the true source flows away. Yet the blood and qi are still strong, and the will resolute. If one cultivates diligently, the foundation of the elixir can still be established with ease.

By forty, another sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi are depleted, corresponding to *Pi*, Stagnation. Heaven and earth do not interact; the two qi return to their separate domains. Yin prevails within, while yang loses its place without. Yet if one cultivates diligently, what is perilous can be stabilized, and what is lost can be preserved.

By forty-eight, another sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi are lost, corresponding to *Guan*, Contemplation. The two yangs remain outside, but the power of yang is faint. Heavy yin ascends, and the qi of yin flourishes. If one cultivates diligently, one may suppress the burgeoning yin softness and support the waning yang power.

By fifty-six, another sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi are depleted, corresponding to *Bo*, Splitting Apart. Five yins rise together above, while the single yang is about to return below. The qi of yin overflows, and the strength of yang barely remains. If one cultivates diligently, it is like adding fire to nearly spent wood or rain to withering seedlings.

By sixty-four, the cycle of hexagrams is complete. The three hundred eighty-four *zhu* of primordial qi—one *jin*—bestowed by heaven, earth, and one’s parents, is entirely dissipated, returning to *Kun*, the Receptive. Pure yin prevails, and yang qi has yet to stir. Yet if one cultivates diligently, gathering the medicine and grafting it moment by moment, yin at its extreme can generate yang, and what is exhausted above can return below. The soft is transformed into the firm, and old age is restored to strength.

If at this time one does not encounter a perfected being and cultivate with urgency, though one may preserve the remaining years, it is only by relying on grain essence to nourish the postnatal qi. There will be no more primordial qi of the prenatal, and how then can one attain longevity and immortality?

This is why the insubstantial transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into blood, blood into form, form into the infant, the infant into the child, the child into youth, youth into maturity, maturity into old age, old age into death, death back into the insubstantial, the insubstantial back into spirit, spirit back into qi, qi back into things—transformations unceasing, like an endless ring.

All things do not wish to be born, yet cannot but be born; all things do not wish to die, yet cannot but die. Let dust arise and dust vanish—ten thousand transformations, ten thousand births—yet none can escape the sea of suffering. Age after age, life after life, the wheel turns without end, without beginning or conclusion, like a well’s pulley.

All mortals in the Three Realms suffer this submersion. Thus, people do not know whence life comes—one must investigate the state before one’s parents’ birth. Nor do they know whence death comes—only by knowing its origin can one know the source of life. People do not ask whither death leads—one must investigate the descent of the hun and po after death. Only by knowing whither it goes can one know the destination of death.

The mechanism of death arises from life; the mechanism of life originates in death. Without the mechanism of death, there is no death; without the mechanism of life, there is no life. The mechanisms of life and death are interlinked—this is why people are subject to life and death. When the mechanisms are not interlinked, the perfected transcend life and death.

That which is subject to life and death is the body; that which is beyond life and death is the mind. When one awakens, the mind lives; when one is deluded, the mind dies. Thus, what is perilous can be stabilized, and what is lost can be preserved.

By forty-eight, another sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi are lost, corresponding to *Guan*, Contemplation. The two yangs remain outside, but the power of yang is faint. Heavy yin ascends, and the qi of yin flourishes. If one cultivates diligently, one may suppress the burgeoning yin softness and support the waning yang power.

By fifty-six, another sixty-four *zhu* of primordial qi are depleted, corresponding to *Bo*, Splitting Apart. Five yins rise together above, while the single yang is about to return below. The qi of yin overflows, and the strength of yang barely remains. If one cultivates diligently, it is like adding fire to nearly spent wood or rain to withering seedlings.

By sixty-four, the cyclical hexagrams have completed their course. The three hundred eighty-four *zhu* of primordial qi—bestowed by Heaven, Earth, and one’s parents, totaling one *jin*—are now fully depleted, returning to *Kun*, the Receptive. Pure yin governs, and yang qi has yet to stir. If one cultivates diligently, ceaselessly gathering the medicine and ceaselessly grafting it, then yin at its extreme will generate yang, and what has reached its zenith will return below. The soft transforms into the firm, and old age reverts to strength.

If at this stage one does not encounter a perfected being and engage in urgent cultivation, though one may preserve the remaining years, it is merely by relying on grain essence to nourish postnatal qi, with no primordial qi of the prenatal remaining. How then can one attain immortality and avoid death?

This is why the insubstantial transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into blood, blood into form, form into the infant, the infant into the child, the child into youth, youth into maturity, maturity into old age, old age into death, death back into the insubstantial, the insubstantial back into spirit, spirit back into qi, and qi back into things—a ceaseless cycle like an endless ring.

All things do not wish to live, yet cannot but live; all things do not wish to die, yet cannot but die. Let dust arise and dust vanish, let the myriad transformations and births unfold—they cannot escape the sea of suffering. Age after age, life after life, the wheel of rebirth turns without end, without beginning or conclusion, like a well’s pulley.

All mortals within the Three Realms are subject to this drowning. Thus, the common people know not whence life comes, for they have not investigated the state before their parents’ union; nor do they know whence death comes, for knowing its origin reveals the source of life. They do not ask whither death leads, for they have not examined the descent of the hun and po after death; nor do they ask whither life leads, for knowing its destination reveals the source of death.

The mechanism of death arises from life, and the mechanism of life originates in death. Without the mechanism of death, there is no death; without the mechanism of life, there is no life. The mechanisms of life and death are interlinked—this is why the common people are bound to the cycle of life and death. When the mechanisms of life and death are no longer interlinked, the perfected transcend life and death.

That which is subject to life and death is the body; that which is beyond life and death is the mind. When delusion returns, the mind is born in confusion; when confusion returns, the mind dies.

Thus, the immortals and buddhas, moved by compassion, teach that all sentient beings possess an inherent luminous true awareness, yet blinded by ignorance, they fail to perceive it. The celestial mandate of their nature drifts and flows ceaselessly, turning without awakening. Life after life, they fall, losing their bodies to other forms and their spirits to alien shells, until their root of true nature no longer resides in humanity.

I shall employ the sagely Dao to enable all beings to forever sever delusion, attaining for themselves the immortals’ longevity or the buddhas’ deathless state.

**On Orthodox and Heterodox Teachings**

The Great Dao generates Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth generate humanity and the myriad things. Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things share a single nature in essence. Heaven has yin and yang; Earth has firmness and softness; things have male and female; humanity has man and woman. From yin and yang arise the sun, moon, and stars; from firmness and softness arise mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees; from male and female arise birth by womb, egg, moisture, and transformation; from man and woman arise mating and procreation.

Sentient beings, through mating, develop lust; through procreation, they develop attachment. From lust and attachment arise demonic obstacles and afflictions; from demonic obstacles and afflictions arise all sufferings and hardships; from all sufferings and hardships arise birth, aging, sickness, and death.

Thus, the Most High, embodying the virtue of cherishing life, opened the gate to deliver the world, composing scriptures and establishing methods to teach people to return to simplicity and restore purity. "Without desire, observe the mystery; with desire, observe the gateway." Attain emptiness and guard stillness; return to the root and recover the mandate. Early return accumulates deeply; deep roots and wondrous stems flourish. Attain the One and guard the center; empty the heart and fill the belly. Weaken the will and strengthen the bones; blunt the sharp and untangle the knots; harmonize the light and merge with the dust. Concentrate qi to achieve softness; embrace the One without departure. Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine; know the bright, yet guard the dark. Close the gates and seal the orifices; wear coarse cloth while holding jade. In profound obscurity, its essence is called life; in vast indistinctness, its essence does not leak. Daily growth means daily increase; no leakage means no exhaustion. Essence transforms into qi, qi transforms into spirit, and spirit returns to the insubstantial. The Five Phases cannot steal it; yin and yang cannot control it. It unites with the Dao as its body, transcending Heaven and Earth. This is Laozi’s Dao of tranquility and namelessness.

To the Han dynasty, when the Perfected Wei Boyang revered the *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* and composed the *Triplex Unity*, the names of dragon-lead and tiger-mercury first appeared. By the Tang and Song dynasties, immortals emerged in succession, and alchemical scriptures flourished. Horizontal and vertical explanations, myriad alternate names—recorded in the alchemical texts—are beyond counting. Yet in the end, they all reveal the same single thing under different names.

The sagely teachers, in expounding the teachings, provided exhaustive and detailed explanations, truly desiring that each person awaken and every individual attain realization. Yet the more names proliferated, the more affairs multiplied; the more books accumulated, the more the Dao became obscured. Moreover, much was couched in cryptic language and hidden allusions, sealing every aperture so that scholars found no crevice to enter. Dazzled and disoriented, they could only sigh in despair.

Fortunately, my teacher, the Perfected Yin, emerged, wishing to continue the thread of the Great Dao and restore the ancient teaching of namelessness. Thus, he pruned away the superfluous, distilled the essentials, swept aside metaphors, and revealed the true transmission. He highlighted the correct principles, established images according to the diagrams, and for what could not be conveyed in writing, he wrote; for what could not be expressed in speech, he spoke. Directly pointing: What is lead and mercury? What are dragon and tiger? What are the crucible and furnace? What are the medicinal substances? What is called gathering and harvesting? What is called drawing and adding? What is called warming and nourishing? What is called the fire times? What is the true seed? What is true nature and life? What is the congealing of the embryo? What is completion? He clarified each point with utter transparency, leaving nothing concealed.

Those who later aspire to the Dao will no longer be misled by alchemical scriptures. Moreover, the alchemical classics and philosophical works are as numerous as the oxen that could laden a house, yet most expound on theory while few preserve the oral instructions. They lack a starting point for entry, a method for gathering the medicine and congealing the embryo, and a final principle for completion. Later practitioners, unaware of the proper sequence, how could they achieve coherence? Inevitably, they err by skipping ahead or lagging behind, inverting head and tail. Many spend their lives studying the Dao yet never find the gate to enter.

Some enter the gate but do not know how to ascend the steps; some ascend the steps but do not know how to enter the hall; some enter the hall but do not know how to enter the inner chamber. Thus, the ordered work of cultivation is the foremost task in refining the truth—how could it be neglected?

I most admire the four-line verse in the *Canon of the Hidden*:
*"Sentient beings are boundless—I vow to ferry them all;
Afflictions are boundless—I vow to sever them all;
Dharma gates are measureless—I vow to study them all;
The Buddha’s Way is supreme—I vow to accomplish it."*

The World-Honored One also said: *"Only after ferrying all sentient beings does one become a Buddha."* Moved by this, I have roused a single thought of compassion, exhaustively overturning the secret instructions imparted by my teacher, laying bare the entire treasury. I call out to those of later generations who are destined—may they return to the celestial realm and not drown in the sea of suffering. This is my heart’s intent.

The first principle: Nurture the root source and safeguard the treasure of life.
The second: Settle the spirit in the ancestral aperture and gather the primordial.
The third: Conceal within the qi cavern, where all wonders return to the root.
The fourth: Heaven and human unite in activation, gathering the medicine into the crucible.
The fifth: Qian and Kun intermingle, refining away the dross to retain the gold.
The sixth: The numinous elixir enters the furnace, nourishing the sacred embryo.
The seventh: The infant takes form, emerging from the sea of suffering.
The eighth: Shift the spirit into the inner court, sitting in solemn stillness of mind.
The ninth: The original body becomes empty, transcending the three realms.

Within these, there are further methods for refining the form, congealing the embryo, and regulating the fire times—completing the work of the ninefold cyclical return of the elixir. The oral instructions of the Great Dao are fully revealed here.

Yet today’s Daoists, with their towering hats and square robes, are self-satisfied, unwilling to humble themselves to seek a teacher’s guidance on the ordered steps of the Great Dao. Instead, they blindly grope like archers shooting at random, straying onto side paths and winding trails. Little do they know that the three thousand six hundred Daoist methods and the twenty-four grades of the great elixir are all mere byways—only this Golden Elixir is the true path of cultivation. Beyond this, there is no other way to become an immortal or a Buddha.

Thus, at the *Lotus Sutra* assembly, the World-Honored One pointed and said: *"Only this one matter is real; the other two are not true."* Master Yin said: *"The ninety-six heterodoxies and three thousand six hundred byways—let them all be illusions; only this is real."* Master Yunfang said: *"Three thousand six hundred Daoist methods, each clinging to a single sprout—who knows this subtle mystery lies beyond them all?"*

The Great Dao is difficult to encounter yet easy to accomplish, though its effects manifest slowly. Byways and minor arts are easy to learn yet hard to master, though their effects appear swiftly. Thus, those greedy for wealth and lust often remain deluded and unenlightened. Among them are those who favor furnace fires, those who favor the other’s household, those who gaze at the crown of the head, those who guard the navel’s stem, those who circulate the eyes, those who fix on the glabella, those who massage the navel wheel, those who sway the spine, those who tuck the external kidneys, those who turn the windlass, those who practice the Three Peaks’ battle, those who consume milk before the furnace, those who hold breath and circulate qi, those who bend and stretch in daoyin, those who return the three fields, those who lift the golden wells, those who lie on ice and expose their backs, those who ingest mushrooms and herbs, those who absorb qi and swallow saliva, those who visualize internally, those who fast and abstain from grain, those who endure cold and eat filth, those who move essence and circulate qi, those who observe the nose and regulate breath, those who leave their wives and enter the mountains, those who meditate on forms, those who imitate bears and birds, those who dine on mist and absorb qi, those who sit long without lying down, those who undergo seven-day trials to refine demons, those who sit in dhyāna without speech, those who fast and abstain from flavors, those who dream of wandering in immortal realms, those who silently worship the Emperor Above, those who chant secret mantras to expel evil, those who recite scriptures by sight and sound, those who consume their own essence to return to the origin, those who pinch the coccyx to close the pass, those who refine urine into autumn food, those who take the *Classic of the Female* as red lead, those who use the afterbirth to refine the purple river chariot, those who open the pass with black lead to forge the male-female swords, those who close their eyes and still their minds to practice the Eight Brocades, those who exhale the old and inhale the new to practice the Six Qi, those who face the wall to subdue dragons and tigers, those who lightly rise to ride the wind and chariot, those who swallow essence and sip blossoms to gather the sun and moon, those who pace the Big Dipper to observe the stars, those who follow the sequence of hexagrams to face *Tun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk, those who peddle the arts of yellow and white to burn straw and play with fire, those who yearn for immortality and deathlessness, those who aspire to ascend in broad daylight, those who cling to form without transformation, those who drift into emptiness without return, those who uphold precepts, concentration, and wisdom to seek liberation, those who dispel greed, hatred, and delusion to seek purity, those who wish to transcend the Western Land in life, those who wish to ascend to heaven in death—such chaotic and tangled practices are too numerous to list.

Daoists and Buddhists alike, clutching one technique or one formula, claim it is the Golden Elixir and the Great Dao, stopping there. Alas! These people are like those who glimpse a leopard through a tube or view the sky from the bottom of a well. They recklessly cite a hundred ends, their explanations fragmented and scattered, shattering the Great Dao into broken pieces and dividing it into countless gates. With delusion, they point the way to delusion; blindly cultivating, they blindly refine.

Those who refuse to reflect on their own errors instead teach others the wrong path. Thus, Master Wang Liang composed the *Breaking Delusion Song*, Chen Niyan wrote the *Luofu Lament*, and Elder Zhongli crafted the *Song of the True Way*. Each enumerated the faults of the myriad side doors to rescue those lost on crooked paths. Among them, there are indeed several methods that can treat illness, aid the aged and infirm, extend lifespan, and bring peace and joy in this life. Occasionally, some even achieve liberation—yet this only amounts to becoming an immortal of Penglai Isle or an arhat. As Master Fu the Great said: *"Though one endures eighty thousand kalpas, in the end, one still falls into emptiness and perishing."* Such are the efforts of the Lesser Vehicle, not the complete embodiment of the Great Dao.

Thus, Zhang Pingshu declared: *"To learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality; only the Golden Elixir is most true."* For the Way of the Golden Elixir is simple, not convoluted. Its essence is emptiness and non-being; its function is purity and stillness. Action initiates the beginning; non-action perfects the end. From start to finish, there is nothing lofty or arduous to practice. Yet why do people of this world seek the distant when the Dao is near, pursue the difficult when the task is easy? Turning from light to grope in darkness—is this not delusion?

Now, *jin* (gold) denotes firmness; *dan* (elixir) is a metaphor for perfection. This is the original face of humanity within the vast sea of Vairocana’s nature. The World-Honored One named it *"the empty yet not empty, the Tathāgata-garbha."* The Old Master called it *"the mysterious beyond the mysterious, the gate of all wonders."* Speaking of the Dao in these terms, it is the supreme and most venerable Way; speaking of the Dharma, it is the foremost and ultimate teaching. All sages and worthies of the Three Teachings follow this path of cultivation—what could be more correct than this?

Your innate aspiration is precisely to seize this era of radiant imperial brilliance, to plant the seeds of primordial *qi* together with all beings, and to join as companions beneath the Dragon-Flower Tree. Thus, this discourse is offered to turn the crooked toward rectitude. Moreover, the various diagrams and secrets transmitted by my teacher are here set forth in full clarity, enabling all learners to verify them against the alchemical classics and grasp them without doubt.

The *Universal Illumination Diagram*, the *Reflected Illumination Diagram*, the *Timely Illumination Diagram*, and the *Internal Illumination Diagram*—such are the great methods, the *Quintessence of the Myriad Spirits*!

The primordial *qi* of humanity arises anew each day:
At the *zi* hour, the *fu* qi reaches the coccyx.
At the *chou* hour, the *lin* qi reaches the back chamber.
At the *yin* hour, the *tai* qi reaches the Mysterious Pivot.
At the *mao* hour, the *dazhuang* qi reaches the *jiājí*.
At the *chen* hour, the *shu* qi reaches the *táodào*.
At the *si* hour, the *gan* qi reaches the Jade Pillow.
At the *wu* hour, the *gou* qi reaches the *níwán*.
At the *wei* hour, the *tun* qi reaches the Hall of Light.
At the *shen* hour, the *pi* qi reaches the *shānzhōng*.
At the *you* hour, the *guan* qi reaches the Central Basin.
At the *xu* hour, the *bo* qi reaches the Dry Gate.
At the *hai* hour, the *kun* qi returns to the Sea of Qi.

The human body possesses the *rèn* and *dū* meridians, which govern the summation of yin and yang.
The *rèn* meridian arises from the *zhōngjí*, descends along the inner abdomen, ascends through the *guānyuán* to the throat, and is the sea of yin meridians.
The *dū* meridian arises from the lower extremity, penetrates the spine, ascends to the *fēngfǔ*, follows the forehead to the nose, and is the sea of yang meridians.
The deer’s exercise involves circling the spine, for it unblocks the *dū* meridian.
The tortoise’s method of nasal breathing unblocks the *rèn* meridian.
If one can unblock these two meridians, then the hundred meridians will all flow freely, and illness will vanish.

The heart is the sovereign’s office, whence spirit and clarity emerge.
The lungs are the minister’s office, whence governance and regulation emerge.
The liver is the general’s office, whence strategy and deliberation emerge.
The gallbladder is the office of impartiality, whence decision and resolution emerge.
The *shānzhōng* is the emissary’s office, whence joy and delight emerge.
The spleen is the granary’s chief, whence the five flavors emerge.
The large intestine is the office of transmission, whence transformation and change emerge.
The small intestine is the office of reception, whence the transformation of matter emerges.
The kidneys are the office of strength, whence skill and ingenuity emerge.
The brain is the sea of marrow; all marrows belong to it. Thus, from the *níwán* above to the coccyx below, all are governed by the kidneys.
The *shānzhōng*, located between the two breasts, is the sea of *qi*, able to distribute yin and yang and serve as the source of generation and transformation. Hence, it is called the *hǎimó*. Beneath the lungs and adhering to the ribs and abdomen like a curtain, it shields the upper burner from the fumigation of turbid *qi*.
The *yōumén*, situated between the large and small intestines, allows fluids to seep into the bladder, while turbid waste flows into the large intestine, whence transformation and excretion occur.

The upper tier of the *Universal Illumination Diagram* directly points to the aperture of the heart-source and sea of nature.
The middle tier directly points to the aperture of the central yellow palace.
The lower tier directly points to the aperture of the *guānyuán* and sea of *qi*.
These are called the *Three Front Passes*.

The lower tier of the *Reflected Illumination Diagram* points to the aperture of the *wěilǘ* and Supreme Mystery.
The middle tier points to the aperture of the twin *jiājí* passes.
The upper tier points to the aperture of the *tiāngǔ* and *níwán*.
These are called the *Three Rear Passes*.
Danyang said: “Three before, three behind—gather them up, and carry them as one.” Such is the meaning.

The *Timely Illumination Diagram* elucidates the mechanism of yang’s ascent and yang’s descent, the subtlety of the Four Symbols revolving at the center.
The *Internal Illumination Chart* indicates the five viscera, six bowels, twenty-four vertebrae, and the *rèn* and *dū* meridians, enabling the inner observer to know where to begin.
If one does not understand the apertures yet speaks of cultivation, it is like one who cannot stand yet speaks of walking.
From ancient times, all immortals transmitted these secrets mouth-to-mouth and heart-to-heart, never daring to openly reveal these apertures to others, for fear of leaking the celestial mechanism.
My teacher, Master Yin, opened the correct knowledge and vision of the Buddha, regarding all beings as his own children. He drew these four diagrams to guide those lost in later times, intending to universally deliver those with karmic affinity and together escape the sea of suffering and death.

The *Taiji Diagram*
This circle (○) is called *Perfect Enlightenment* in Buddhism, *Golden Elixir* in Daoism, and *Taiji* in Confucianism.
What is meant by “without extremity yet Taiji” is that it is the extremity that cannot be exhausted.
At the very beginning of a person’s life, that single spark of numinous light which governs the physical form is the Taiji.
Before the parents’ birth, that expanse of supreme emptiness which does not belong to the physical form is the Wuji.
Master Du said: “To recognize the original true face, behold the single moon before the body’s birth.”
Master Yin said: “The Taiji has two principles: in terms of its movement, it is called *timing*; though heaven and earth are not beyond a single breath. In terms of its coagulation, it is called the *true seed*; though a single grain can contain heaven and earth.
*Hibernation, returning to the root, tranquil repose, profound obscurity*—these pertain to the Taiji of timing.
*Conception, fruition, copulation, gestation*—these pertain to the Taiji of the true seed.
If one can preserve these two extremities without loss, then one may attain everlasting life without transformation—how could it be merely fulfilling one’s allotted years and meeting a natural end?
Great indeed is the Taiji!”

The Taiji within this body—generating and transforming ceaselessly—endures with heaven and earth. To attain everlasting life without transformation is to transcend heaven and earth. To refrain from harming life and shun perverse transformations is to fulfill one’s allotted years and meet a natural end. To sever generation and cut off transformation is to achieve everlasting life and remain unchanging. Fulfilling one’s years and meeting a natural end differs from the common mortal; to live and grow without transformation is to be as the immortals and buddhas. Both arise from the Taiji, yet their functions differ.

All know the Taiji existed before heaven, earth, and the myriad things, yet few realize that once heaven, earth, and the myriad things exist, each possesses its own Taiji. The Taiji has *timing* and the *true seed*. The Taiji before heaven, earth, and the myriad things resides in the *xu* and *hai* conjunctions. With these two conjunctions, the Taiji initiates a primal transformation. Each year, the Taiji resides in the ninth and tenth months; with these two months, a yearly transformation unfolds. Each month, the Taiji resides from the twenty-sixth to the thirtieth day; with these five days, a monthly transformation occurs. Each day, the Taiji resides in the *xu* and *hai* hours; with these two hours, a daily transformation arises. Each hour, the Taiji resides in the two profound and obscure moments; with these two moments, an hourly transformation takes place.

The Taiji of animals lies in hibernation and conception; the Taiji of plants lies in returning to the root and fruition; the Taiji of the human body lies in tranquil repose, profound obscurity, copulation, and gestation. Copulation has its time, and nurturing has its method—if the Taiji is unharmed, one fulfills one’s years and meets a natural end. Severing lust and entering profound obscurity at the proper time to preserve the Taiji whole is to attain everlasting life without transformation.

The Way of fulfilling one’s years and meeting a natural end may still face decay, but the Way of everlasting life without transformation can lead to becoming an immortal or a buddha—forever free from decay. How could this merely distinguish one from the common mortal, or set one apart from grasses, trees, birds, and beasts?

**Central Diagram**
This diagram specifically illustrates the single aperture of the mind’s emptiness, numinous clarity, and unwavering awareness. This aperture is originally boundless and fathomless, inherently vast and impartial, purely good and unadulterated. Radiant and luminous, it is perfectly penetrating and unobstructed. To deem it as non-perceiving and non-hearing is to mistake its nature; to regard it as devoid of supreme numinosity is to fail to recognize its presence. It is fundamentally without location, without beginning or end.

Before heaven, earth, and the myriad things, this was already so; after their arising, this remains unchanged. From the utmost non-being to the utmost being, from the utmost being to the utmost non-being, it is the numinous essence of qian and kun, the mysterious pivot of primordial transformation, the root of each person’s nature and life, the great foundation of the world’s myriad things and affairs. The *Taiyi*’s Taiji, Four Images, and Eight Trigrams all emerge from this. Shun called it *the Center*; Confucius called it *the One*. It is the transmission of emperors and kings, the heritage of sages and worthies. To illuminate this is to *brilliantly manifest lofty virtue*; to know this is to *know the Yi*; to perceive this is to *see the Dao*; to establish this is to *establish the great foundation of the world*. To penetrate this is to fully realize one’s nature and take command of one’s destiny—transformation lies entirely within oneself.

**Fire Dragon and Water Tiger**
Black lead and the water tiger are the root of heaven and earth’s generation, possessing form and qi. Red lead and the fire dragon are the origin of heaven and earth’s generation, possessing qi without form. That which has form is true lead, the essence of the great yin moon, the mother that nurtures the forms of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. That which is formless is true mercury, the light of the great yang sun, the father that generates heaven, earth, and the myriad things.

The bodies of lead and mercury interbreed in endless cycles, giving birth to heaven, earth, and the myriad things—their ancestral origin. The ancient perfected ones, knowing these numinous substances lay hidden within, borrowed symbolic methods to gather the essence of the great yin and employed crucibles to attract the qi of the great yang, guiding them into the chamber of spirit. There, they merged in ceaseless union, generating boundless offspring. From water, the hun is born; from metal, the po is born. When hun and po congeal, they transform into the *yinin* and *e*, coalescing into a hundred treasures—this is called the *Golden Elixir of Return*.

**Sun Crow and Moon Hare**
The sun is yang. Yang contains yin, like cinnabar containing mercury. Without yin, yang cannot illuminate its hun, hence it is called *female fire*—yang containing yin. Within the sun is the crow, corresponding to the south in the trigrams, called the *Li Maiden*. Thus it is said: *Though the sun occupies the high position, it is female.*

The moon is yin. Yin contains yang, like lead containing silver. Without yang, yin cannot refine its po, hence it is called *male metal*—yin containing yang. Within the moon is the hare, corresponding to the north in the trigrams, called the *Kan Man*. Thus it is said: *Though Kan resides in the toad palace, it is male.*

The *Wulou* says:
*Lead seeks the essence within the hare’s brain,*
*Mercury takes the blood from the golden crow’s heart.*
*Drive these two substances to form the elixir—*
*The supreme Dao is not complex, nor forced.*

The *Wuzhen* says:
*First take qian and kun as the crucible and vessel,*
*Then gather the crow and hare to refine the medicine.*
*Once these two are guided into the Yellow Path,*
*How could the Golden Elixir fail to be born?*

These two substances are of one body.

**Great and Small Crucibles and Furnaces**
In refining the great Golden Elixir, one must first establish the furnace and set up the crucible. The crucible is neither gold nor iron; the furnace is neither jade nor stone. The *Yellow Court* is the crucible; the *qi cavern* is the furnace. The Yellow Court lies directly above the qi cavern, connected by fine channels—the convergence of the body’s hundred meridians. The trigram of the crucible says: *In the correct position, the mandate is congealed.*

This is called the Small Crucible and Furnace. The position of *qian* is the crucible; the position of *kun* is the furnace. Within the crucible lies the yin of mercury—this is the root-nature of the Fire Dragon. Within the furnace lies the yang of the Jade Bud—this is the life-stem of Water’s completion. The Tiger below serves as the pivot for kindling fire; the Dragon above stirs the wind and waves of ascending clouds. If the yang within the furnace arises and the yin descends without error, then within the crucible, the celestial soul and earthly spirit linger in embrace, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger clasp one another, and the Jade Hare and Golden Crow entwine. With the fire-timing harmonized, the supreme treasure is refined. Thus Qingxia Zi says:

*A crucible—no metal crucible,*
*A furnace—no jade furnace.*
*Fire arises below the navel,*
*Water seals the crown within.*
*Once the three natures converge,*
*The two substances naturally constrain.*
*The embryo is sealed, no leakage—*
*Transformation occurs in an instant.*

This is called the Great Crucible and Furnace.

**On Inner and Outer Medicines**
In all refinement, one first cultivates the outer medicine, then the inner medicine. Yet those of the highest attainment, who have long nurtured their spiritual root, need not refine the outer medicine but proceed directly to the inner. The inner medicine is effortless and without method; the outer medicine is deliberate and purposeful. The inner medicine is formless and without substance, yet in truth it *is* the outer medicine—embodied and functional. And though the outer medicine *seems* to exist, it can cure illness and bestow longevity. With prolonged contemplation of the inner medicine, one may transcend, entering non-being from being and returning to being from non-being. The outer medicine pertains to the external interplay of yin and yang; the inner medicine to the internal convergence of *kan* and *li*.

Speaking of the outer medicine: the essence of intercourse must first be preserved without leakage; the breath must be subtle and measured; the spirit of thought must rest in tranquility. Speaking of the inner medicine: to refine essence is to refine primordial essence—drawing forth the primordial yang from *kan*; when primordial essence is firm, the essence of intercourse naturally does not leak. To refine *qi* is to refine primordial *qi*—supplementing the primordial yin within *li*; when primordial *qi* abides, the breath naturally ceases its egress and ingress. To refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit—*kan* and *li* unite in the body and return to the primordial *qian*; when primordial spirit congeals, the spirit of thought naturally attains profound stillness. Cultivating both inner and outer, one is certain to attain immortality.

**On the Three Passes: Forward and Reverse**
The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things—this is the forward process that generates humans and all beings. Now, however, form transforms into essence, essence into *qi*, *qi* into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—this is the reverse process that perfects immortals and buddhas.

The Initial Pass refines essence into *qi*: one must recognize the moment when *tiangui* arises and swiftly gather it. At the time of gathering, employ a lingering intent to draw fire and drive metal into motion, naturally reversing the flow—thus the Great Elixir congeals within the crucible.

The Middle Pass refines *qi* into spirit: riding the blazing force of this fire, one drives the River Chariot in reverse from the Supreme Mystery Pass to the Celestial Valley Cavern, where *qi* and spirit merge, then descends to the Yellow Chamber. As it is said: *When the union of qian and kun ceases, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court.*

The Upper Pass refines spirit to return to emptiness: abiding in oneness and embracing the primordial, one returns spirit to the Sea of Vairocana’s nature. Now, the Three Passes proceed from effort to effortlessness—this is the gradual method. To cultivate the Upper Pass while encompassing the two below is the sudden method. To proceed directly to refining spirit and returning to emptiness: when effort reaches the extreme of emptiness and profound stillness, essence spontaneously transforms into *qi*, and *qi* into spirit. This is the purport of Guan Yinzi’s *forgetting spirit and transcending life.*

**On Fulfilling Nature and Completing Destiny**
The Cinnabar Field is likened to the sun; the primordial nature within the heart to the moon. The sunlight naturally reflects back upon the moon—after their union, the true body generates gold. The moon receives the sun’s *qi*, thus on the third day a single yang arises: once the elixir resides in the crucible, one senses a single point of numinous light illuminating the heart without day or night. Yang arises on the eighth day of the moon, and the second yang is born. The second yang is the elixir’s golden *qi* slightly flourishing, and the primordial nature slightly manifest. From the second yang’s birth at the full moon, the three yangs become complete—this is when the primordial nature is fully manifest, like the moon at its fullest. On the sixteenth day, a single yin arises: this is the beginning of nature returning to destiny. From the birth of the first yin to the twenty-third day of the moon, the second yin is produced—this is when nature has returned two-thirds to destiny. From the birth of the second yin to the thirtieth day of the moon, the three yins are complete—this is when nature has entirely returned to destiny. At the outset, one employs destiny to grasp nature; when nature is complete, one then employs nature to settle destiny. This is the great mechanism of dual cultivation of nature and destiny.

**On the True Earth as the Root of the Heart**
The *qi* from which heaven’s *qi* arises is stored boundlessly within the earth of heaven and earth. The *qi* from which human *qi* arises is stored boundlessly within the earth of the human body. Thus, the roots of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom lie in the heart—just as the roots of plants lie in the soil. When the roots of plants lie in the soil, they naturally flourish and branch forth; when the roots of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom lie in the heart, one’s countenance naturally glows. Mencius said: *Dwelling transforms the qi; nurturing transforms the body.* The *Great Learning* said: *When the heart is expansive, the body is at ease.* If the heart is vast and the body at ease, to claim that illness does not leave the body is delusion. Yet if the branches and leaves wither and dry, what then? One must return directly to the root: nurture it, irrigate it—having nurtured and irrigated it, can the vital impulse fail to revive? For when the root of a plant ails, its branches and leaves ail. The human heart is like the root of a plant: when the heart ails, the body ails; when the heart is not ailing, the body does not ail. Thus, bodily illness stems from illness of the heart. And these few words—*the body at ease*—are the sagely medicine for dispelling illness.

**On the Hun and Po**

The cloud-like is called *hun*; the white-like is called *po*. The cloud is wind, and wind is Wood; the white is *qi*, and *qi* is Metal. Wind disperses, hence it is light and pure—light and pure, so the *po* ascends with the *hun*. Metal and wind are heavy and turbid—heavy and turbid, so the *hun* descends with the *po*. Thus, the sage moves the *po* with the *hun*, while the common person is grasped by the *po* through the *hun*. The *hun* dwells in the eyes by day, the *po* lodges in the liver by night. Dwelling in the eyes, one can see; lodging in the liver, one can dream. Those who dream much are ruled by the *po*; those who wake much are mastered by the *hun*. For the *po* gives rise to essence, essence gives rise to the *hun*, the *hun* gives rise to spirit, spirit gives rise to intent, and intent gives rise to the *po*. These five ceaselessly revolve, and so the false heart of the self drifts through the transformations of creation for countless eons without end. Yet how many myriad sprouts arise from a single kernel? Though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel from the void. How many myriad birds hatch from a single egg? Though yin and yang are subtle, they cannot hatch an egg from a barren hen. Therefore, the sage responds to the myriad things with nature, not with the heart. Nature is the heart before it stirs; without the heart, there is no intent; without intent, there is no *po*; without the *po*, there is no rebirth—and the wheel of rebirth ceases forever.

**On the Toad’s Radiance**

The great void is vast and boundless; the bright moon shines resplendent. Snow-white waves surge, and the golden toad spits forth its glow. People see that the moon is bright and say: *When the Metal essence flourishes, the moon is bright.* Yet who knows that the Metal is born from the moon? People see that Metal is produced by the moon but do not know that the moon’s brightness originally comes from the sun. The moon is an analogy for the original nature; water is an analogy for the Kan palace; the golden toad is an analogy for the aperture of true yang. The original nature is the moon’s function. When the nature first appears, it is round and luminous, gleaming like a shooting star. For when the *qi*-quality nature briefly stills, the original spirit’s true nature manifests—just as the moon appears when clouds part, and the sun’s radiance emerges when mist scatters. Upon seeing this thing, recognize clearly that the primordial *qi* has been born—hasten to gather it. It is like seeing a thief and seizing him at once, lest he escape again. Draw it into the crucible, and the toad’s radiance of primordial *qi* will never depart.

**On Subduing the Dragon**

The Li trigram’s sun is mercury, within which lies the *ji* earth—provisionally called the Dragon. Its form is fierce and malevolent, wielding the power to give life or take it, solely determining the path to Buddhahood or immortality. Its might transforms all things; moved, it responds. Clouds drift and rain falls; the ten thousand things flourish. In the *Changes*, the ninth line of *Qian* reads: *A dragon appears in the field—it is beneficial to meet a great person.* Confucius said: *The dragon’s virtue is upright and centered.* Yet people, failing to grasp the Dragon’s life-giving power, only suffer its harm. If one awakens and fears it, tames and masters it, then one can subdue this fierce Dragon and accumulate the most refined mercury. To subdue it is to restrain the true fire within the heart; when the fire’s nature does not fly, the Dragon can be controlled, and the time to obtain lead arrives. Thus it is said: *Without accumulating mercury, how can one obtain lead? Without subduing the Dragon, how can one tame the Tiger?* Moreover, true lead and true mercury do not easily unite, just as the true Tiger and true Dragon are difficult to subdue. If the Dao-seeker can comprehend this single matter, all other affairs become secondary.

**On Taming the Tiger**

The Kan trigram’s moon is lead, within which lies the *wu* earth—provisionally called the Tiger. Its form is wild and unruly; though it can harm and kill, it harbors the vastness of the Mahayana. Its movements command awe; struck, it responds. Its vast light nurtures the ten thousand things. Wang Chongyang said: *Treading on the Tiger’s tail, it does not bite.* *Heng* further states: *The path of the stubborn is smooth; the secluded person’s divination is auspicious.* Confucius said: *The plain and stubborn advance alone to fulfill their aspirations.* If one awakens and fears it, tames and regulates it, then one can subdue this wild Tiger and produce the primordial lead. To tame it is to subdue the true water within the body; when the water’s source is utterly pure, the Tiger can be tamed, and its harm of biting people ceases. Thus, the sages of past ages took subduing the Dragon as refining the self and taming the Tiger as cultivating the heart. Hence, Master Pure Yang said: *The seven-return elixir lies within the person; first, one must refine the self and await the time.* Master Purple Yang said: *To refine the nine-fold cyclical elixir, first refine the self and cultivate the heart.* All refer to this principle.

**On the Meeting of the Three Families**

The body, heart, and intent are called the Three Families. The meeting of the Three Families is the perfection of the embryo. Essence, qi, and spirit are called the Three Origins. The unity of the Three Origins is the completion of the elixir. Gathering the three into one lies in emptiness and stillness. Empty the heart, and spirit unites with nature. Still the body, and essence and emotion become quiescent. When intent is profoundly settled, the Three Origins merge as one. The union of emotion and nature is called Metal and Wood conjoined; the union of essence and spirit is called Water and Fire intermingled; profound settlement of intent is called the Five Phases complete.

Yet essence transforms into qi through the body’s immobility. Qi transforms into spirit through the heart’s immobility. Spirit transforms into emptiness through the intent’s immobility. If the heart does not move, then the three of the East and two of the South together form five. If the body does not move, then the one of the North and four of the West are united. If the intent does not move, then the cyclical signs *wu* and *ji* return to generate the number five.

When body, heart, and intent unite, the Three Families meet, and the infant is formed.

**On the Harmony of the Four Symbols**
The Four Symbols are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior. The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. The Dragon, Wood, generates Fire, both gazing toward the heart. The heart is the numinous wonder prior to the Emperor of Images, the true nonbeing within being. If the heart does not move, the Dragon’s roar summons clouds, and the Vermilion Bird folds its wings, gathering primordial qi.

The Tiger, Metal, generates Water, both bound to the body. The body is the purity since kalpas began, the wondrous being within nonbeing. If the body does not move, the Tiger’s howl stirs wind, and the Dark Turtle retreats, congealing primordial essence. When essence congeals and qi gathers, Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire blend within true Earth, and spirit, vitality, soul, and corporeal soul cluster within true intent.

True intent is the *Qian* Origin, mother of Heaven and Earth, root of yin and yang, source of Water and Fire, ancestor of Sun and Moon, origin of the Three Powers, progenitor of the Five Phases. All things rely on it for generation and completion; all spirits depend on it for joy and sorrow. If intent does not move, the two substances unite, the Three Treasures coalesce, the Four Symbols harmonize, the Five Phases cluster—all converge in the Central Palace, and the great elixir is complete. Thus, Master Purple Yang said: *"The Five Phases are complete only in the center of the eight."* This is what he meant.

**On Extracting Kan to Fill Li**
Lead and mercury are the primordial qi of the initial division of the Great Ultimate. Primordial qi is the qi of the Dragon and Tiger’s first crescent. The Tiger dwells in the north within Kan Water, and the yang line within Kan originally belongs to *Qian*. Before the kalpa’s turning, *Qian* tumbled and galloped, mistakenly falling into *Kun*. The middle line of *Qian* was lost, forming *Li*. *Li* is originally mercury’s abode, hence it is said: *"The Yellow Lad within Kan is the ancestor of mercury."* The Dragon dwells in the south within Li Fire, and the yin line within Li originally belongs to *Kun*. After the chaos collapsed, *Kun* received and nurtured, obtaining union with *Qian*. The middle line of *Kun* solidified into *Kan*. *Kan* is originally lead’s gathering, hence it is said: *"The Dark Maiden within Li is the family of lead."*

Thus, male and female dwell apart, lead and mercury in separate crucibles; yin and yang do not unite, and Heaven and Earth are obstructed. The sage uses intent as the Yellow Dame to guide the Yellow Lad within Kan and pair him with the Dark Maiden within Li. When husband and wife unite, they revert to pure *Qian*, called extracting Kan to fill Li, restoring our primordial body. Thus, the *Awakening to Reality* says: *"Extract the solid center within Kan, and transmute the yin within Li’s belly."* This is precisely the meaning.

**On Reciting the Avalokiteśvara Mantra**
This mantra is the Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva’s sublime mind-seal.

If one transcribes the Six-Syllable Great Bright Mantra, it is equivalent to copying the entire Three Treasuries of the Dharma. If one recites the Six-Syllable Great Bright Mantra, it is equivalent to chanting the seven-scroll sacred scriptures. Moreover, it opens the gate of wisdom, rescues from a hundred difficulties and sufferings, purifies the karmic debts of three lifetimes, and eliminates all transgressions and obstructions, liberating one from the cycle of birth and death and bringing peace to the Dharma-body.

Yet, reciting the mantra also has its esoteric secrets. Thus, in the first syllable, chant *Oṃ*, calling forth the Vairocana Buddha within one’s body. In the second syllable, chant *Ma*, calling forth the Acala Buddha within one’s body. In the third syllable, chant *Nī*, calling forth the Ratnasambhava Buddha within one’s body. In the fourth syllable, chant *Pad*, calling forth the Amitāyus Buddha within one’s body. In the fifth syllable, chant *Me*, calling forth the Amoghasiddhi Buddha within one’s body. In the sixth syllable, returning upward to the throat to sound *Hūṃ*, calling forth the Vajra Mahāsthāmaprāpta within one’s body. With prolonged practice, the five *qi* return to their origin, accomplishing inconceivable merit and attaining perfect enlightenment.

**On Refining the Heart in the Nine Cauldrons**
The sun is the cinnabar of Heaven; if obscured by darkness, it ceases to be cinnabar. The heart is the cinnabar of humanity; if clouded by external things, it ceases to be cinnabar. Thus, refining the elixir means refining away the obscuring yin influences to restore the heart’s original nature—the natural endowment of Heavenly mandate. The nature of Heavenly mandate is our true gold, possessed by all. The nature of *qi*-quality is the dross of gold, unavoidable even in the wise. If refined daily with the fire of human relations and daily conduct, the *qi*-quality nature diminishes. As the *qi*-quality nature diminishes, the nature of Heavenly mandate naturally manifests.

Thus, the Five Emperors and Three Kings, though rulers, refined their hearts daily through the Dao of rulership. Yi, Bo, Zhou, and Shao, though ministers, refined their hearts daily through the Dao of ministership. Confucius, Zengzi, Zisi, and Mencius, though teachers, refined their hearts daily through the Dao of teaching. Their hearts were ever aligned with the Dao, ever refined by the Dao—this is the essential method of learning for the great sages and worthies of antiquity, the luminous teaching of hundredfold refinement, heart-refinement, and nature-refinement.

**On the Return of the Eight Consciousnesses to the Origin**
The Buddhists say that human rebirth arises from the union of father’s essence, mother’s blood, and the *vijñāna* of a past life, forming the embryo. The essence and *qi* are received from the parents, but the *vijñāna* is not. It flows from beginningless kalpas and is called the nature of arising and ceasing. Thus, the arising-and-ceasing and the non-arising-and-ceasing combine to form the eight consciousnesses.

Within creation, there exists an eternal, unchanging true sovereign and a *qi*-circulation that shifts with time. The union of the true sovereign and *qi*-circulation is called the nature of Heavenly mandate. The nature of Heavenly mandate is the primordial spirit. The nature of *qi*-quality is the *vijñāna*. Thus, the Confucians speak of transforming the *qi*-quality, and the Chan school teaches returning *vijñāna* to wisdom. Yet, people mistakenly take the luminous, numinous thing within the present moment—undifferentiated from external objects—as the primordial spirit. They do not realize this is the root of life and death, not the unarising, unceasing primordial spirit.

Alas, recognizing the *vijñāna* is easy; eliminating it is difficult. Without the primordial spirit of Heavenly mandate battling the *avidyā* karmic *vijñāna*, one remains in the realm of arising and ceasing, never seeing a day of liberation.

**On the Five Qi Returning to the Origin**
When the primordial *qi* first divided, the Two Modes took form; when the Two Modes settled, the Five Constants emerged. The Five Constants, though distinct, each guards its direction; the five directions, though different, each governs its child. The child of the Azure Emperor is named Dragon Smoke, receiving the third *qi* of the wood virtue of *jiǎ*-*yǐ*. The child of the Vermilion Emperor is named Cinnabar Origin, receiving the second *qi* of the fire virtue of *bǐng*-*dīng*. The child of the White Emperor is named Luminous Essence, receiving the fourth *qi* of the metal virtue of *gēng*-*xīn*. The child of the Black Emperor is named Profound Darkness, receiving the first *qi* of the water virtue of *rén*-*guǐ*. The child of the Yellow Emperor is named Constant Abiding, receiving the fifth *qi* of the earth virtue of *wù*-*jǐ*.

Thus, metal is born from earth, wood flourishes from earth, water is stilled by earth, and fire is quelled by earth. Only the sage knows the Dao of returning to the subtle and the principle of reverting to the origin. Thereby, the five gather, the four converge, the three unite, the two merge, and all return to the One.

When the body is unmoving, essence is stabilized, and water returns to the origin. When the heart is unmoving, *qi* is stabilized, and fire returns to the origin. When true nature is quiescent, the *hun* is concealed, and wood returns to the origin. When deluded emotions are forgotten, the *po* is subdued, and metal returns to the origin. When the four great elements are harmonized, intent is settled, and earth returns to the origin. This is called the five *qi* returning to the origin, all gathering at the crown.

**On Awaiting the Imperial Summons**
After nine years of wall-facing, the numinous terrace is crystalline, the sea of awareness perfectly luminous, nature and life merge, form and spirit are both wondrous. One’s virtue joins with Heaven and Earth, one’s body unites with the Great Void—this is akin to the completion of the elixir path, yet the accumulation of merit and practice must not be neglected.

For the Dao and virtue are like yin and yang; practice and merit are like the sun and feet. Master Zhongli said: *"Merit without practice is like having no feet; practice without merit is like being eyeless. When merit and practice are both complete, feet are naturally provided—who says one has no share in becoming an immortal?"*

Thus, the ancient immortals and supreme sages, having accomplished the golden elixir and completed the work of nurturing, roamed the human world, blending light with the mundane. According to their strength, they built merit; according to the circumstances, they liberated beings. They rescued the imperiled, aided the distressed, saved the world from calamity, and guided the times. They universally ferried the deluded, guided later learners, accrued merit in the Dao, and practiced virtue among people. When merit and practice were fulfilled, they concealed themselves to await the moment, only expecting the descent of the celestial decree, the arrival of the Jade Maiden, riding mists and ascending clouds, straight into the sacred realm of the Three Purities.

As Master Zhang Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"When virtue’s cultivation surpasses eight hundred,
and hidden merits accumulate to three thousand,
the jeweled talisman descends with the celestial decree—
steadily riding the jade chariot and phoenix palanquin to court Heaven."*

**On Ascension**
Among immortals, there are five ranks; among Buddhas, three vehicles. Differences in cultivation and merit lead to varying degrees of transcendence.

The highest is *ascension through soaring flight*; next is *transformation through seated dissolution*; and further below is *rebirth by seizing a new vessel*.

Those who *ascend riding dragons* include the Yellow Emperor, Mao Meng, Wang Xuanfu, and Wei Shanjun.
Those who *ascend riding clouds* include Yang Xi, Li Ji, Lan Caihe, and Sun Bu’er.
Those who *ascend riding carp* include Zi Ying and Qin Gao.
Those who *ascend riding simurghs* include Zi Jin and Deng Yu.
Those who *ascend riding cranes* include Huan Wen and Qu Chujing.
Those who *ascend riding the wind* include Ge You and the Lord of Mount Wuyi.
Those who *ascend with their entire households* include He Hou, Yin Xi, the Prince of Huainan, and Xu Jingyang.
Those who *ascend in broad daylight* include Cai Qiong, Feng Chang, Ma Chengzi, and Fuqiu Bo.

Upon consulting the *Register of Immortals*, one learns that from ancient times to the present, over one hundred thousand have attained immortality, and more than eight thousand households have ascended together. Thus, Master Chunyang inscribed a couplet on the wall of Jingfu Temple:
*"Do not say the immortals lack a path of study—
how many have ascended from ancient times to now?"*

**Collected Essentials**
*Oral Instructions of the First Section on Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life*

**Nurturing the Root Source to Preserve the Treasure of Life**
*(Diagram of Nurturing the Root Source)*
*(Including the Two Methods: Retreat, Concealment, Bathing, and Refining the Form with Jade Fluid)*

To cultivate longevity, one must recognize the root of one’s existence;
To seek deathlessness, one must understand the deathless being.
Thus it is said: Only by recognizing the deathless one does one become deathless.
That deathless being—Daoists call him the "Iron Man," Buddhists name him the "Vajra," and he is none other than the originally wondrous, awakened true heart of all people.
This heart is luminously aware, clearly and constantly knowing;
Its essence is neither born nor destroyed, its appearance neither comes nor goes.
Tracing it to the time before heaven and earth, none know its beginning;
Pursuing it to the time after heaven and earth, none know its end.
Lofty without superior, vast beyond measure;
Profound without inferior, deep beyond fathoming.
Heaven and earth rely on it for their covering and bearing,
Sun and moon rely on it for their illumination,
The void relies on it for its boundless expanse,
The ten thousand spirits rely on it for their transformations.
The great sages of the Three Teachings instruct people in the Dao—this is what they cultivate.
To become an immortal or a buddha is also this;
To wear horns and fur is also this.
The paths of sage and commoner diverge from this.
To emerge from birth and death, there is no other way;
To ascend to nirvana, this is the sole method.

Yet among the ten thousand things of the world, not one is not devoured by impermanence—
Only this remains, unbound by birth and death, unseen in form or appearance,
Upright and proper, steady and true, distinct and clear,
Yet people do not awaken to what is originally theirs.
Why do they not awaken? Because of the deluded heart.
What is the deluded heart?
From beginningless time, all beings have been deluded about the true heart, unaware of themselves,
Thus they undergo transmigration, vainly entering the various destinies.
Originally, the true heart is without delusion, its nature-wisdom fundamentally luminous, wondrously pure and primordial.
But with the sudden arising of delusion, it is instantly obscured,
Losing that primordial purity, withering the clarity that gives rise to knowing.
Thus wisdom is transformed into consciousness, and the deluded heart within form is called "consciousness."
The heart is originally without knowing; it knows because of consciousness.
Nature is originally without nature; it arises because of consciousness.
The seed of the embodied life sprouts here,
Opening the flower of defilement, bearing the fruit of birth and death.

Now, people deludedly recognize within the square inch [of the mind] a bright, luminous thing,
Merged indistinguishably with external objects, and take this to be the original spirit.
Little do they know this is but the consciousness of life and death, the seed of kalpas of rebirth.
Thus Jingcen said:
*"Those who study the Dao yet do not awaken to the true
Are merely recognizing the consciousness from before.
The root of birth and death through measureless kalpas—
Fools call this the original person."*

Alas!
People take the servant for the master without knowing,
Recognize the thief as their child without realizing.
Thus the World-Honored One taught: First sever the root of beginningless rebirth—this is it.
Once this root is severed, the various consciousnesses have no support,
And one recovers the originally luminous, ever-bright essence.

Yet the great Dao is vast—where to begin?
Thus, to straighten one’s robe, one must first grasp the collar;
To mend a net, one must first lift the mesh.
Formerly, Master Yin pointed out: the single correct path of cultivation.
He taught people to start from the source.
If the source is pure, heavenly principle is ever present,
And deluded thoughts naturally cannot defile it.
Like the sun at high noon, specters vanish without trace—
This mind-ground Dharma-gate is the unchanging Dao of the thousand sages of past and present.

Thus Laozi said: *"In cultivating the Dao, first observe the heart."*
The method of observing the heart lies wondrously in the "spirit-pass," a single aperture.
From the moment of receiving life and sensing qi at conception,
One is endowed with heaven and earth’s single point of primordial yang,
Which transforms to generate this aperture, wherein the original spirit is stored.
Within it is emptiness, vast and utterly luminous—
The master of our life’s arising and ceasing.
Truly, with it one lives; without it, one dies.
Life and death, flourishing and decline—all depend on this.
The Confucians call it the "spirit-terrace,"
The Daoists call it the "spirit-pass,"
The Buddhists call it the "spirit-mountain."
The Three Teachings share a single Dharma-gate, all pointing to this single luminous aperture.

The Buddhist teaching says:
*"The Buddha is on Spirit-Mountain—seek him not afar.
Spirit-Mountain lies within your own heart.
Each person has a Spirit-Mountain pagoda—
Cultivate well beneath the Spirit-Mountain pagoda."*
This speaks of its location.

The Daoist teaching says:
*"Few recognize the root and stem of the great Dao.
Who among ordinary people knows its daily use?
I point out for you the immortals’ cave—
A single aperture, curved like the crescent moon."*
This speaks of its form.

This aperture is the terrace of the numinous spirit, the secret treasury.
Truly pure, luminous, wondrous, empty, scattered, numinous, and free—
Sole and independent.
The root-source of all beings, thus called the "mind-ground."
What the buddhas attain, thus called "bodhi."
Interpenetrating and harmonious, thus called the "Dharma-realm."
Quiescent and eternally blissful, thus called "nirvana."
Unsullied and undefiled, thus called "purity."
Unfalse and unchanging, thus called "true suchness."
Free from error and fault, thus called "buddha-nature."
Guarding the good and shielding from evil, thus called "dhāraṇī."
Concealing and containing, thus called the "tathāgata-garbha."
Transcending the mysterious and secret, thus called the "Vairocana’s Pure Land."
Encompassing all virtues in great completeness,
Shining alone to dispel the darkness of the multitudes—
Thus called "perfect enlightenment."
In truth, all refer to this single aperture.

Turn from it, and one is common;
Follow it, and one is sagely.
Be deluded about it, and birth and death begin;
Awaken to it, and rebirth ceases.
To cease rebirth, nothing surpasses embodying the utmost Dao.
To embody the utmost Dao, nothing surpasses observing and illuminating the original heart.
One must use the eye of wisdom as a clear mirror,
Ever keeping the bright moon radiant,
Often illuminating with wisdom in samādhi.
At all times, preserve this state before the seven emotions arise;
At all times, fully retain this essence before the eight consciousnesses are defiled.
Externally, cease all conditions;
Internally, extinguish all delusions.

Gather the light of the eyes, condense the resonance of the ears,
Regulate the breath of the nose, seal the qi of the tongue.
Let the four limbs remain unmoving,
So that the five senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—
Each return to their root.
Then the five spirits—spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, intellect, and intent—
Each settle into their proper place.

Throughout the twelve double-hours,
The eyes must always inwardly observe this aperture,
The ears must always reverse-hear this aperture,
And as for the tongue’s alignment, it must always face this aperture.
In all actions and movements, thought after thought must not depart from this aperture;
In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, the heart-mind must always abide in this aperture.
Not for a single instant may one forget its illumination,
Nor carelessly transgress it.
Should the spirit-light stray, swiftly draw it back;
In haste or leisure, never depart from this.

This is what Zisi meant by *"not to be departed from even for a moment."*
First, preserve it to empty the heart-mind;
Next, forget it to expand one’s capacity.
In every place and time, unbound and at ease—
This perfectly accords with the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*’s dictum:
*"The subtlest essential is first to preserve, then to forget."*
This is the innermost secret within the secret.

Yet to advance in eliminating the six senses,
One must know what comes first and what follows.
Though intent is the commander of the six senses,
The eye is the vanguard of the five thieves.
Thus the ancients said:
*"The heart-mind is the trigger-mechanism; the eye is the thief."*
To subdue the heart-mind, first restrain the eye.

For the crossbow’s release depends on the trigger,
And the heart-mind’s entanglement begins with the eye.
If the trigger does not move, the crossbow remains still;
If the eye does not move, the heart-mind remains still.
The *Yin Convergence Classic* says: *"The mechanism lies in the eye."*
The *Dao De Jing* says: *"Not seeing what is desirable, the heart-mind is not disturbed."*
The *Analects* says: *"Do not look at what is contrary to ritual."*
Master Zhu said: *"Restraining the external nurtures the internal."*
The *Golden Casket and Jeweled Register* says:
*"The eye is the mysterious portal of spirit-communication;
Restrain it in the eye so it returns to the heart-mind."*
When the eye guards this aperture without departure,
It becomes the Tathāgata’s *"right Dharma-eye,"*
In accord with the esoteric essence of *"nirvāṇa-heart."*

Thus the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says:
*"To practice this contemplation is called right contemplation;
Any other is called wrong contemplation."*
And the *Contemplation Sūtra*, in its *"Contemplation of the Heart-Mind"* chapter, says:
*"Within the three realms, the heart-mind is master.
One who can contemplate the heart-mind attains ultimate liberation;
One who cannot is forever sunk in delusion."*
The first chapter of the *Dao De Jing* says:
*"Always having desires, one observes its manifestations"*—this means observing this aperture.
*"Always without desires, one observes its mysteries"*—this means observing the mystery within this aperture.

The Yellow Emperor’s *"three months of inward observation"* referred to this.
The Most High also said:
*"From limitless kalpas past, I observed the heart-mind and attained the Dao,
Even to the point of emptiness and nothingness."*
Observing the heart-mind is not easy;
Halting thoughts is even harder.

Thus, where thoughts arise lies the root of birth and death.
The ancient immortals said:
*"The Great Dao teaches people first to halt thoughts;
If thoughts do not cease, all effort is in vain."*
The *Perfect Enlightenment Sūtra* says:
*"In all circumstances, do not give rise to false thoughts regarding false hearts,
Nor seek to extinguish them by abiding in false states.
Do not add understanding to what is beyond understanding,
Nor discriminate what is real."*
The *Awakening of Faith* says:
*"If the heart-mind scatters, immediately gather it back,
Directing it toward right mindfulness.
When a thought arises, immediately awaken to it;
Awakening to it, it vanishes.
The wondrous gate of practice lies solely in this."*
Master Xu of Empty Tranquility said:
*"Do not fear thoughts arising; only fear awakening too late.
Thoughts arising are illness; not continuing them is the medicine."*

Know that false thoughts arise from the root of consciousness,
Forming delusion when confronted with objects—
Yet in truth, they have no substance.
In the state of sentient beings, wisdom is weak and consciousness strong,
So it is called *"consciousness."*
In the state of Buddhahood, wisdom is strong and consciousness weak,
So it is called *"wisdom."*
Only the name changes, not the substance.

Originally, the single source of the heart-mind was vast, wondrous, and luminous.
But with the establishment of knowing and seeing, false dust arises,
And thus false thoughts emerge.
If knowing and seeing are without seeing,
Then wisdom-nature is truly pure,
Returning to the wondrous and luminous,
Penetrating and clear—
And thoughts of intent vanish.
When thoughts of intent vanish,
The six senses and all below naturally vanish as well.
This is what Mañjuśrī meant by:
*"When one sense-root returns to its origin, the six sense-roots attain liberation."*
With no six sense-roots, there are no six sense-objects;
With no six sense-objects, there are no six consciousnesses;
With no six consciousnesses, there are no seeds of rebirth.
With no seeds of rebirth,
This single point of true heart-mind stands alone, without dependence,
Empty and vast, luminous and pure—
Eternally abiding through ten thousand kalpas, never arising nor ceasing.

This Dharma directly points to the human heart-mind,
Resolving all at once.
How direct! How simple!
Only by nurturing the original source
And observing the original aperture,
Over time, the heart-mind will naturally renew,
The qi will flow freely,
Congealing into stillness,
Silent and thoughtless,
Suddenly knowing emptiness,
Clearly awakening to nature.
This is what is meant by:
*"When skin and flesh are entirely shed,
The single truth will soon be seen."*

At this stage of practice,
Naturally, the spirit becomes bright and radiant,
Wisdom arises day by day,
The heart-mind’s nature becomes spiritually attuned,
And one moves freely between concealment and revelation.
Naturally, there arises a mechanism of tranquil opening and closing,
A delight in soaring and lively movement.
Naturally, a single point of original yang-qi emerges from within,
Descending to the Yellow Court,
Entering the earthen cauldron,
Passing through the coccyx,
Piercing the spine,
Rising to the Heavenly Valley,
Flowing down to the Winding River,
Circulating through the hundred channels,
Irrigating the Three Fields,
Driving out the yin evil from the hundred apertures of the body,
Scouring the turbidity from the five viscera and six bowels.
Like taking the medicine of Good Vision King, all illnesses vanish;
Like playing the strings of a lion’s sinews, all other sounds cease.

Thus it is said: "With one heart-mind, ten thousand illnesses are cured, without need of many prescriptions."
From this, we know that all the sages enter through this expedient gate of the heart-mind, attaining the rank of ancestral buddhas and becoming teachers of humans and devas.
That ordinary beings cannot realize this is because they do not recognize their own heart-mind.
Hence the saying: "When the sea dries up, its bottom is finally seen; when a person dies, the heart-mind remains unknown."
The multitudes of the six realms all emerge from this gate, yet after a thousand kalpas they do not return—how grievous this is!
Thus, when all buddhas awaken to the burning house, ancestral masters come from the West for this very reason, and even a thousand sages sigh in sorrow—all because they do not comprehend the essential Dao of the mind-only.
As the *Treatise on the Precious Treasury* states:
Within the bounds of heaven and earth, amid the expanse of the cosmos, there is a treasure concealed within the mountain of form.
It discerns things with numinous illumination, empty both within and without, silent and elusive—so profound it is called the Mystery of Mysteries.
Its subtlety emerges beyond the Purple Tenuity; its function resides in the realm of emptiness and nothingness.
Upright and unchanging, it stands alone without peer.
Its sound issues forth as wondrous resonance; its radiance manifests as splendid countenance.
Though utterly visible, it leaves no trace, and so is named the Empty of Empties.
Only its resonance remains, yet its form is unseen; only its efficacy endures, yet its appearance is invisible.
In darkness and light, it shines with clarity; in the principles of things, it flows through emptiness.
Like a jeweled seal of the forest of pearls, it is the true source of the ten thousand images.
In activity, it takes form; in stillness, it merges with the obscure.
Originally pure, it needs no polishing; dharmically complete, it is perfect by nature.
Its brilliance outshines the sun and moon; its virtue surpasses the Great Clarity.
The ten thousand things do not act; all things are nameless.
It transforms heaven and earth, moving freely and unrestrained.
Its wondrous functions are as boundless as the Ganges’ sands, coalescing into primordial chaos.
Who would not rejoice upon hearing of it? Who would not be astonished?
Yet how could such a priceless treasure remain hidden in the pit of the shadowy person?
Alas! Alas!

Its self-depreciation is lamentable! Alas! Alas!
How may obscurity become luminous?
Its treasure shines resplendent, radiant and bright,
illuminating the ten directions.
In the intervals of stillness, nothing exists;
its responses are majestic and unobstructed.
It answers to sound, to form,
to yin, to yang.
Marvelous things have no root,
yet their wondrous functions endure.
In the blink of an eye, it is unseen;
with an ear turned aside, it is unheard.
Its origin is obscure;
its transformations take form.
In its being, it is sagely;
in its function, it is numinous.
It may be called the true essence of the Great Dao,
its essence most numinous,
the cause of the ten thousand existences.
Abiding in stillness, it is eternal,
of the same kind as the Dao.
In all the world, nothing is more intimate than the heart.
Yet the common people use it without knowing it—
like fish in the sea, unaware of the water.
Thus the Buddhist sutras say:
All sentient beings,
since beginningless kalpas,
have been deluded about their original heart,
failing to awaken to it themselves.
They falsely recognize the four elements as the body
and discriminating thoughts as the mind—
as if, amidst a hundred thousand seas,
one recognized only a single tiny bubble.
In this delusion, delusion arises upon delusion;
following conditions, they drift and turn,
generating emotions from what meets the eye,
grasping at a hundred thousand ends
without a moment’s respite.
Thus they give rise to confusion, create karma,
and cycle through the six paths,
enmeshed in a net of their own making,
unable to escape.
In the end, all stems from the fault of a single delusion
that obscures the true.
Thus Lingrun said:
When will the karmic passions that drag one along ever end?
They betray the single point of light in the numinous terrace.

The single point of light in the numinous terrace
is the luminous knowing mind of true suchness.
Most profound, most wondrous,
it communicates with sages, with spirits.
Utterly transcendent, utterly vast,
it is the king that transforms the ten thousand dharmas,
the substance of all existences.
It penetrates the three realms,
spans the ten directions.
Before the primordial chaos was divided,
it already existed.
Even after heaven and earth are destroyed,
it will not cease to be.
All realms of experience
are but the light of this mind.
If one recognizes the mind,
there is not an inch of earth in the great land.
Thus it is said: The three realms are only mind.
The deluded seek dharmas outside the mind;
the enlightened see all realms as mind.
The realm is the mind’s realm;
the mind is the realm’s mind.
Facing realms without delusion,
meeting conditions without movement,
subject and object mutually arise,
one body without distinction.
If one can penetrate the realm as only mind,
awakening to the mind is the Dao.
When awakening exhausts the beginningless,
deluded thoughts gather realms back into the mind.
Emerging from the tangle, true suchness,
free from defilement, liberated,
one eternally unites with the originally pure—
then the mountains, rivers, and great earth,
all conditioned phenomena, no longer arise.
Like gold extracted from ore,
it will never again be stained by dust and mud;
like wood turned to ash,
how could branches and trees regrow?
Once attained, it is attained forever,
throughout all future kalpas.
Eternally freed from the cage,
one dwells long in the realm of sages.

Yet this supreme vehicle of the Great Dao—
if one’s faculties are sharp,
one may leap directly into the ground of Tathāgata.
But if one’s faculties are dull, what then?
One must proceed from lower learning to higher attainment,
gradually guiding one into the Dharma gate.
Let each step taken yield its own effect,
each ascent its own measure.
This is the meaning of journeying far from near,
climbing high from low.
If one does not know the effort of entering the gate and beginning,
how can one suddenly reach the ultimate ground?
If one has not fully devoted the heart,
how can one know the nature?
If one has not illuminated the mind,
how can one see the nature?

The essentials of illuminating the mind and fully devoting the heart are these:
At times, support the heart with wholesome dharmas;
at times, moisten the heart with the Red Waters;
at times, purify the heart with realms of experience;
at times, strengthen the heart with diligence;
at times, broaden the heart with forbearance;
at times, clarify the heart with awakened reflection;
at times, brighten the heart with wisdom;
at times, open the heart with the Buddha’s knowledge and vision;
at times, expand the heart with the Buddha’s equality and vastness.
Thus it is known:
Illuminating the mind is the wise oar in the sea of birth and death;
fully devoting the heart is the good physician for the illness of afflictions.
If this mind is obscured,
one will eternally transmigrate, losing the true nature.
If this mind is illuminated,
one will suddenly rise from birth and death,
fully realizing nirvana.
From beginning to end, nothing lies outside this mind;
apart from this mind, there is no mystery.

Though later there may be gradual efforts,
they are but the completion of this alone.

Alas!
It seems easy to understand,
yet the enlightened are rarely met,
and oral instructions are seldom heard.
Thus Zhang Ping Shu said:
*Only because the alchemical classics lack oral instructions,
where can you be taught to conceive the numinous embryo?*
Little do they know that the oral instructions are already recorded in the classics—
mostly, the mother is kept secret from the child,
not openly explained,
so that people cannot piece them together.
Moreover, many are couched in metaphors and hidden words,
bewildering the eyes and confusing the mind of learners,
causing them to retreat midway.
I deeply pity them.
Now I shall point out, one by one,
the oral instructions from the alchemical classics and Sanskrit texts,
leaving them for later generations—
a lamp to illuminate the darkness,
a touchstone to distinguish truth from falsehood.

The Supreme Mystery Perfected One said:
*The single numinous point before parents were born,
if not numinous, is only because it has taken form.
Once form veils the seed of light,
put it down, and it is again utterly clear.*

Empty Illumination Chan Master said:
*This is clearly the same in every one,
able to embrace heaven and earth, to move empty space.
Now I directly point to the true ground of the mind:
empty stillness and luminous knowing are the fundamental teaching.*

The Natural Layman said:
*The heart is like a bright mirror, clear as the sky;
the nature is like a cold pond, still as water.
In the twelve hours, constantly awaken and reflect—
do not let the master be obscured.*

Wisdom Awakening Chan Master said:
*Bodhisattvas have never left the true,
yet one’s own delusion estranges them.
If one can sit in stillness and turn the light to reflect,
one will see the old master from before birth.*

The Three Mao Perfected Lords said:
*The numinous terrace, limpid as an ice vessel,
only allows the original spirit to dwell within.
If one leaves even a single thing there,
how can one realize the Dao and unite with purity?*

The Natural Chan Master said:

The mind is inherently free from dust—why wash it?
The body harbors no illness—why seek a physician?
To know where the Buddha is not,
observe the bright mirror hung high before it shines.

Master Zhu Jing said:
Before arising, the mind is the nature;
after arising, the nature must follow.
If one fails to fathom the source of mind and nature,
one vainly searches through past traces.

The Unminding One said:
When deluded thoughts arise, the spirit strays;
once the spirit wanders, the six thieves ravage the heart-field.
With mind and eyes in chaos, the body has no master—
the six paths of rebirth lie before one’s eyes.

Venerable Miaoxu said:
The vigilant master dwells,
still and unmoving, within the numinous palace.
Simply leave no obstructions here,
and the natural essence is itself empty and vast.

Perfected Lord Taiyi said:
A single point of perfect clarity equals the great void,
yet when thoughts arise, the body is formed.
If one can let go and turn the light to reflect,
one returns to pure emptiness—nothing remains.

*Avataṃsaka Sutra* verse:
Through countless kalpas beyond count,
bodhisattvas know this as but a single thought.
Entering thus into the bodhi practice,
they diligently cultivate without retreat.

Chan Master Haiyue said:
Six gates lead to one pass—
no need to barricade the other five.
Though worldly affairs swirl in chaos,
the household lord sits calmly in the hall all day.

Chan Master Shui’an said:
Without a single thought, Mount Sumeru stands;
wait and see where it stands when you look.
A cow stumbles over a thread’s weight—
yet every household’s gate opens to Chang’an.

Master Dawei’s verse:
The true Buddha, non-doing, resides within me;
three calls, three responses—so keenly awake.
If one fails to grasp the reason,
through endless kalpas one mistakes the spirit.

Wu Gouzi said:
Atop the mountain of the five aggregates, a stretch of emptiness—
entering and leaving the same gate, they never meet.
For measureless kalpas, one rents a dwelling,
yet in the end fails to recognize the master.

Chan Master Weikuan said:
I urge you: study the Dao without craving.
When all things are unminded, the Dao converges.
Unminding begins with the embodiment of the unminding Dao—
embody it, and the Dao too ceases.

Venerable Zhi said:
Sudden awakening opens the mind’s treasury,
revealing hidden traces and true forms.
Alone one walks, alone one sits—ever majestic,
a hundred billion transformations, countless in number.

Chan Master Daitang said:
"With no place of abode, let the mind arise"—
vast and clear, luminous and true everywhere.
Directly open the eye at the crown,
and the great thousandfold world manifests in full.

*On Pointing to the Mystery*:
If the mind is empty, then nothing remains—
what birth and death? What constraints?
One morning, cast off the womb-state robe,
and become a carefree noble man.

Perfected Lord Duan said:
Observe the mind within the mind to seek the original mind;
when all minds are extinguished, the true mind appears.
The true mind, bright and penetrating, spans the three realms—
demons and external paths dare not intrude.

Zhang Yuanxiao said:
Unborn and undying, originally true—
priceless night-luminous pearl, yet people do not recognize it.
For thousands of lives, ordinary beings waste their time,
entangled in ore, unable to emerge.

Xue Daoguang said:
Five thousand words of wondrous counsel—*Dao and Virtue*;
three hundred verses of true essence—*Yin Talisman*.
If the mind holds not a single word,
even without Chan practice, one is already at work.

Wu Gouzi said:
To study the Dao, first know your own mind—
the depths of one’s own mind are hardest to fathom.
If you can seek to the point where seeking ceases,
you will awaken: the ordinary mind is the Buddha-mind.

Master Xiaoyao said:
Sweep away the six thieves to purify the heart’s foundation;
let go of honor, disgrace, sorrow, and joy.
Focus the qi to its utmost softness, peer within—
naturally, the spirit-chamber gives birth to the Muni.

*Playing with Marbles*:
The celestial mechanism’s profundity is not lightly spoken;
Yan’s feigned stupidity, Zeng’s dullness.
Ask where they applied their effort—
only in not hearing and not seeing.

Zhang Sanfeng said:
The true mind, vast and boundless,
gives rise to limitless immortals from within.
Yet people cling to their petty forms,
oblivious to the single mystery-pearl.

*Song of Breaking Delusion*:
To keep true essence from leaking,
the numinous terrace must be as bright as the moon.
If the numinous terrace is impure, the spirit will not come—
day and night, never cease your effort.

Bei Ta Zuo said:
Beware of following what you do not understand—
this great following spreads across the land.
In the true purity of nature, at the first thought,
already there are a thousand divergences and ten thousand differences.

Hengchuan Gong said:
The cave waters, without cause, flow backward—
seeing their distress, one cannot help but save them.
The ancestral intent from the West is neither intent nor non-intent—
when deluded thoughts and wild mind cease, all is at rest.

Chan Master Caotang said:
Severing the arm to seek the mind, the mind is not found;
seeking the mind and not finding it, the mind at last is at peace.
After the mind is at peace, in the snowy courtyard at night,
jade-like flowers fill the eye—yet nowhere to be found.

Chan Master Foguo said:
Mind-mind is Buddha, Buddha-mind-mind;
Buddha-Buddha mind-mind is Buddha-mind.
When mind and Buddha awaken, nothing remains—
like a general quenching thirst by gazing at a silent forest.

*Avataṃsaka Sutra* verse:
If one wishes to know the Buddha’s realm,
purify the mind until it is like empty space.
Far removed from delusion and all grasping,
let the mind’s direction be without hindrance.

*Ratnakūṭa Sutra* verse:
All Buddhas gain liberation through the mind—
the mind, when pure, is called stainless.
The five paths, bright and unsullied, are untainted;
understanding this, one attains the great Dao.

Chan Master Yuanwu said:
Buddha after Buddha, the Dao is the same—each Dao interpenetrates;
mind after mind, the true accords—each accords with the true mind.
Vast and clear, transcending the power of sound,
as enduring as earth, as boundless as the sea.

Precentor Shi Qi said:
All dharmas are empty, thus my mind is empty;
my mind is empty, thus all dharmas are the same.
All dharmas and my mind share no separate essence—
all is contained in this very thought.

Zhang Zhuo the Scholar said:
Luminous warmth pervades the Ganges’ sands—
ordinary and sacred, originally one family.
When not a single thought arises, the whole body manifests;
when the six senses stir, clouds obscure it.

Chan Master Zhongfeng said:
From the beginning, the supreme Dao is intimate with the mind;
when study reaches the point of unminding, the Dao is true.
Mind and Dao, being and nonbeing—all extinguished—
the great thousandfold world becomes a single leisurely body.

Zhang Wumeng said:

The heart abides in the numinous pass, the body has its master;
qi returns to the primordial sea, life knows no end.

Master Baisha said:
A thousand practices yield a thousand attainments,
a single thought sustains a lifetime’s discipline.

Peng Helin said:
The chamber of spirit is this numinous union,
within it lies the immortal, deathless embryo.

Yongming Yanshou said:
With thought arises birth-and-death;
without thought, nirvana.

Hu Jingzhai said:
In times of no affair, let not the heart be empty;
in times of affair, let not the heart be chaotic.

Daoist Layman Daoxuan said:
Once sent forth, draw it back;
once returned, let it go.

Luo Nian’an said:
Let not deluded thoughts assail the heart,
let not guest qi harm the primordial qi.

Daoist Shayi said:
If the heart dwells within the cavity,
thoughts do not stray beyond the gate of total retention.

Bai Juyi said:
Since I painfully studied the Dharma of the Empty Gate,
I have dissolved all the hearts of my past lives.

Chan Master Haiye said:
In movement, do not forget observation;
in stillness, do not forget cessation.

From the *Taoguang Collection*:
Where the heart abides, thought abides there too;
in motion thus, in stillness thus.

Chongmiao said:
The body unmoving, the heart finds peace;
the heart unmoving, spirit guards itself.

Xu Wuji said:
Nature, from its partiality, must be subdued and led away;
the heart, when left to roam, must be gathered and reined in.

Foyin said:
When a single thought stirs, all is fire;
when the ten thousand conditions are still, spring arises.

Tao Hongjing said:
To cultivate the heart, be a guest of long life;
to refine nature, be like one alive yet dead.

Chan Master Wuzhuo said:
Illumination is the luminous heart’s emptiness and stillness;
seeing is the seeing of nature’s unbornness.

The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says:
If one can truly observe the nonduality of mind,
only then does one see Vairocana’s pure body.

The *Avataṃsaka Verses* say:
From the first thought to the end of kalpas,
all arises from the thoughts of sentient beings.

Ma Danyang said:
If one can long guard the winding aperture,
spirit will be numinous and bright, qi will be full.

Qiu Changchun said:
That single phrase received from the master—
silently lower the curtain and observe carefully.

Chan Master Huiri said:
A single thought illumines a single thought’s bodhi;
a single thought’s stillness is a moment’s nirvana.

The above words are all essentials for becoming immortal and attaining sagehood,
the gate to the Eight Ways and Eight Virtues.

Formerly, Ānanda, though he had accumulated learning and total retention for years,
did not ascend to sagehood—
only when he ceased conditions and turned to reflect did he momentarily realize the unborn.

For the mind of the ordinary person all day rushes outward,
ever more distant, ever more estranged.
Only in turning to reflect does one examine purity and gather thoughts,
gather thoughts to pacify the heart,
pacify the heart to nourish spirit,
nourish spirit to return to nature—
just as Wei Boyang said: “When metal returns to its original nature,
only then is it called the returned elixir.”

Ah!
Refining ore into gold yields precious treasure;
refining passion to return to nature unites with celestial truth.
Meeting with this principle, among a thousand or ten thousand conversants,
not one speaks of it.

**Retreat and Bathing Practice (Diagram of Washing the Heart and Retreat)**
The *Book of Changes* speaks of “washing the heart and retreating into concealment”—
this phrase’s essence was called “bathing” by the immortals of Tang and Song,
and in recent times has been labeled “turning toward Gen.”
In truth, it is but this principle, this wondrous aperture.

The heart belongs to fire, yet is concealed by the water of the back—
this is the meaning of washing.
The heart dwells in front, yet is concealed behind the back—
this is the meaning of retreat.
Thus, for beginners who subdue the heart,
binding it too tightly risks the affliction of restless fire.
Therefore, temporarily move the heart’s fire from the south
and conceal it in the north of the back’s water.
Water and fire naturally nurture each other,
and thoughts and concerns do not arise—
just as Bai Yuchan said: “Washing the heart and cleansing thoughts is bathing.”

Yet though bathing is a method for washing the heart,
and turning toward Gen has the power to still thoughts,
these principles are correct as far as they go,
but they have not reached the actual ground.
This is the single move beyond—
a secret guarded by a thousand sages and not transmitted to later generations.
Thus, disciples rarely hear of it, rarely encounter it.
If one understands this aperture,
truly one can seize divine power and alter destiny.

An ancient immortal said:
“Through the twin passes of the spine to the crown gate—
this is the honored path of cultivation.”
For it ascends to the celestial valley,
descends to the coccyx,
and connects heart and kidneys,
summoning and gathering numinous yang,
preserving and protecting the treasure of life.
What else could be the path of cultivation?

Before we had this body, we first had this breath;
before this body perishes, this breath will perish first—
what else could be the true path of cultivation?

When a person is first conceived,
within the womb they breathe with the mother,
receiving qi to form this thread,
linked to the mother.
Gradually it expands, gradually opens,
hollow like a tube,
allowing qi to come and go.
In front, it connects to the navel;
behind, to the kidneys;
above, through the spine to the mud-pill palace,
reaching the mountain root where the twin apertures form.
From the twin apertures down to the ridge of the nose,
the two nostrils take shape—
thus it is called the “ancestral nose.”
At that time, one’s qi communicates with the mother’s qi,
the mother’s qi with heaven and earth’s qi,
heaven and earth’s qi with the qi of the great void—
aperture upon aperture, all communicating,
without any obstruction.

When the qi’s allotment is complete,
the womb ruptures, and the infant emerges.
The umbilical cord is cut,
the infant cries out upon the earth,
and a single primordial yang descends to the place of life’s establishment.
From then on, the postnatal takes over.
Though there is still breathing in and out,
it no longer communicates with the original ancestral qi.

From childhood to old age,
not a single breath pauses within.
Ordinary people arise and perish in dust,
dying and being born ten thousand times—
all because they cannot find the old road from which they came.

The Most High taught people to cultivate and attain long life
by seizing the true qi of heaven and earth.
That people can seize the true qi of heaven and earth
is because they have the two apertures of breath.
What is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi from within;
what is inhaled is the true qi of heaven and earth from without.

If one’s root-source is firmly established, then between each breath, one may seize the true qi of heaven and earth to attain enduring longevity. If the root-source is not secure, essence exhausted and qi weakened, the true qi of heaven and earth inhaled will follow the exhalation outward, and the primordial qi within the body will no longer belong to oneself—it will instead be seized by heaven and earth. Why is this? Because the breath does not enter through its proper gate. All ordinary people inhale through the throat, descending to the middle cavity before turning back, unable to connect with the ancestral qi. It is like a fish drinking water—entering through the mouth and exiting through the gills—just as Zhuangzi said, "The breath of the multitude is at the throat."

The perfected person, however, directs the breath straight through the Bright Hall, ascending to the Jiaji, then flowing into the Gate of Life, where it connects with the ancestral qi as naturally as magnet draws iron, like attracting like. This is what Zhuangzi meant by "the true person’s breath reaches to the heels"—the heels signify deep, profound breathing. Once this depth is attained, one’s life rests in one’s own hands and is no longer shaped by the great forge.

Today’s practitioners engage in breath regulation, breath counting, breath restraint, and breath retention, but these are like scratching an itch through a boot—they never reach the mysterious aperture. This aperture first coalesces to form the two kidneys, then generates the heart. The kidneys are like lotus roots, the heart like a lotus blossom, its stem hollow and straight, propping up heaven and supporting the earth. The heart and kidneys are separated by eight inches and four fen, with a remaining space of one inch and two fen between them—this is the "cavity within," the pathway of heart-kidney interaction, the realm where water and fire achieve harmony.

To open this aperture, one must first visualize the root of the nose, allowing the breath to gradually pass through the Jiaji, penetrate the primordial chaos, and reach the life palace. Only then do mother and child reunite, the broken mirror made whole again. As this expands, the root-source becomes complete and firm, the life-treasure preserved—only then can one speak of cultivation.

Master Anle Zhen said: "To keep the ever-bright lamp lit, one must use the method of adding oil." Master Yin said: "Nurturing the root-source comes first; safeguarding the life-treasure is urgent." He also said: "As long as a single breath remains, life can be restored." If one knows the method of adding oil, the extinguished lamp regains its light—just as obtaining the soul-returning incense revives withered roots to flourish anew. Thus it is said: "When the oil is gone, the lamp dies; when the qi is cut off, the body perishes." Without this aperture, oil cannot be added; without adding oil, life cannot be extended. If life is not extended, the nature cannot be retained; if the nature is not retained, when impermanence suddenly arrives, one departs in confusion.

Thus Master Lü said: "Conserve essence early; extend life without delay." Truly, if one extends it, one attains long life; if not, one dies prematurely. For humans receive a limited allotment of qi from heaven and earth. Unaware of how to preserve it, they waste and abandon themselves. As Liu Haichan said: "Harming in the morning and damaging at dusk, lost in ignorance, spirit and essence scatter without foundation; slowly worn away, gradually declining, the primordial harmony is exhausted, and the spirit departs." The moment the mechanism of opening and closing halts, the breath is instantly cut off. Alas! The pivot of life and death is this swift—why then do people refuse to turn their hearts toward the Dao?

Moreover, this effort is most simple and easy. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one need only restrain this heart and withdraw it into the aperture of the Jiaji. Then the true qi of heaven and earth can be drawn in, merging with one’s primordial essence in the cinnabar field to serve as the foundation of life. For with the boundless primordial qi of heaven and earth, extending one’s limited form is not difficult. The practitioner must only recognize this aperture, guard it without departure, and over time, with familiarity, within will be bright and clear, like the moon reflected in water—natural and spontaneous. Dispel the deviant fire, dissolve scattered thoughts, subdue the restless heart, and halt false notions. When false notions cease, true breathing appears; when true thought is without thought, true breathing is without breath. Without breath, the root of life is eternally secure; without thought, the nature-body endures. With nature preserved and life firm, all distracting thoughts vanish—this is the first step in dual cultivation of nature and life.

Alas! Human life is like a rootless tree, relying entirely on breath as its root. When a single breath fails to come, life is no longer one’s own. Therefore, those who seek long life must secure their qi. When qi is secure, the primordial qi within the body does not follow the exhalation outward, and the true qi of heaven and earth constantly enters with each inhalation. Over time, fetal breathing stabilizes, the womb forms, and the path to long life opens. This passage should be read together with the third section, "Hibernating and Concealing Qi in the Cavern."

**Method for Refining Form with Jade Fluid (Illustration of Refining Form with Jade Fluid)**

Beginners, accustomed to labor, upon entering the circle of practice suddenly find ease. With ease, the four limbs do not move; with comfort, the hundred joints do not circulate. This leads to blockage in the channels and stagnation of qi and blood—thus the method for clearing passages and purging impurities cannot be omitted.

This method first employs the governing qi to focus on the Mysterious Throat aperture. This aperture connects to the qi tube, as the *Huangting Jing* says: "The Mysterious Throat and qi tube receive the essence talisman." After a short while, the mouth fills with fluid like well water. Gently rinse several times, then slowly guide it with intention up the Tower of Prominence, gradually reaching the Central Altar, the tailbone, the middle cavity, the Spirit Gate, and finally the Sea of Qi. From the Sea of Qi, split into two paths, descending along the thighs to the knees, then to the Three Li, down to the instep and big toe. Turn into the Bubbling Spring, ascend through the heel and back of the knee, up the thighs to the tailbone, merging into one path. Pass through the kidney hall, the Jiaji, and the Double Pass, then distribute to the shoulders, arms, and elbows, reaching the backs of the hands. From the middle finger, turn to the palms, circle back through the wrists, ascend along the sides of the chest to the cheeks, then pour over the top of the head. Descend through the Bright Hall to the upper palate, where the tongue meets it, returning to the Mysterious Throat to conclude.

This completes one full cycle. After a brief pause, proceed again with the practice before the eyes, and the areas of blockage will gradually open. Not only will this connect all the meridians, but it will also penetrate all the orifices. As the *Heart Seal Sutra* states: "The seven orifices are interconnected, each orifice radiant with light." For our innate luminosity, one orifice encompasses the six directions within, and the six directions without—originally without obstruction, originally without shadow. That it cannot be so is merely due to the hindrance of form. Only when cultivation reaches the state where form and spirit are both wondrous does one truly merge with the Dao.

Why use the eyes in circulating qi? As Shi Jianwu said: "Qi is the elixir that adds years, the heart is the spirit that guides qi; if you know the master of circulating qi, you are already an immortal." The common saying goes: "Where the eyes go, the heart follows; where the heart goes, qi follows." This saying is indeed accurate.

Why use fluids in refining form? Daoists call it the "jade fluid" (saliva), with the "jade pool" being the mouth. The *Yellow Court Inner Scene* states: "The mouth is the Jade Pool, the Palace of Great Harmony; rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid keeps calamities at bay. The body radiates light, qi fragrant as orchids, dispelling all evil and refining the jade-like countenance. Those who cultivate this will ascend to vast realms." For within fluid lies qi, and within qi lies fluid; fluid and qi generate each other, growing daily and monthly, forming the foundation of golden fluid and the treasure that nourishes the body. Moreover, it can penetrate barriers and joints, reaching everywhere without obstruction. An ancient song says: "Frequently swallow the divine water of the Flower Pool, and the Primordial Lord of the Purple Palace will ascend directly. When qi flows freely through the joints, essence naturally fills and the Valley Spirit abides."

The Mysterious Throat, this one orifice, is the sea of fluids, the source of generation and transformation, irrigating the entire body, all originating here. Thus, the *Most High* states: "Beneath the tongue lies the Mysterious Throat, the shore of life and death; if you encounter it, you ascend to the Milky Way." The *Lotus Sutra* praises: "By the white jade teeth flows *śarīra*, from the red lotus fragrance radiates a halo of light. Within the throat, sweet dew trickles and moistens; in the heart, *amṛta* drips and cools." This is the minor jade-fluid method for refining form.

The body’s orifices exist to connect with emptiness, to reach qi, and to circulate throughout the body. If any become obstructed, they cause stagnant phlegm or congested blood, and the body’s meridians fail to interconnect, leading to illness. Practicing this method three to five times daily ensures the free flow of qi and blood, harmonizing the hundred vessels, and dispelling disease. Cease when this is achieved. This method, along with the "retreat and concealment" technique for preservation, serves as two complementary practices that proceed without contradiction.

Cultivating the root source, though it appears to eliminate emotions and perceptions, truly eradicates the mind of arising and ceasing. When the mind is free of arising and ceasing, the body is also free of arising and ceasing—this is certain. To eliminate the mind of arising and ceasing, one must begin with no-thought. When the accumulation of no-thought becomes thoroughly familiar, it leads to dreamlessness. When the stillness of no-thought becomes deeply ingrained, it leads to no-arising. Dreamlessness is the great matter of the present; no-thought is the great matter of the end. No-arising means no creation; dreamlessness means no transformation. Without creation or transformation, there is no arising or ceasing.

For those who study the Dao, the concern is not failure but lack of diligence. If one can be single-minded and diligent, there is nothing that cannot be learned. However, if one’s resolve is not firm, the path not earnestly pursued, changing course from morning to night, beginning with zeal but abandoning midway, delighting in the moment but wearying of perseverance—how can one hope to match the heavens in longevity? It would indeed be difficult. The *Inner Contemplation Sutra* states: "Knowing the Dao is easy, penetrating the Dao is hard; penetrating the Dao is easy, practicing the Dao is hard; practicing the Dao is easy, attaining the Dao is hard; attaining the Dao is easy, guarding the Dao is hard." If it were not difficult, the markets would be full of immortals. How could it be extraordinary?

Cultivating the Dao is like a farmer weeding—one must pull out the roots, and the seed of one’s innate celestial truth will naturally sprout. Moreover, this single-character method is thoroughly simple, easy to practice, and highly effective. Test it in small ways to dispel illness and prolong life; apply it fully to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood. It all depends on the depth of the practitioner’s effort.

**Oral Instructions of the Second Section of *Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life, the Pinnacle of the Ten Thousand Spirits*: Stabilizing the Spirit in the Ancestral Orifice**

*(Diagram of Stabilizing the Spirit in the Ancestral Orifice)*
*(Includes the methods of the Spontaneously Turning Dharmacakra and the Union of Dragon and Tiger)*

The true realm of the Ancestral Orifice is rarely known in the world; without a teacher’s transmission, it is like shooting arrows in the dark. The Ancestral Orifice is what Laozi called the "Gate of the Mysterious Female." The *Awakening to the Dao* states: "To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies, rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root." Thus, Zhang Boduan said: "In refining the Golden Elixir, everything depends on the Mysterious Female." In his *Four Hundred Character Preface*, he wrote: "The Mysterious Female is the one orifice where gathering, union, refinement, bathing, nurturing, and embryo formation occur. Even the transformation and liberation of the spirit after birth all take place here." If cultivators can truly know this one orifice, the path of the Golden Elixir is complete. This is what is meant by "obtaining the One, and all things are accomplished."

However, most alchemical texts use metaphorical language, leaving practitioners without a clear direction. The ancients referred to it as the "Master of the Primordial," the "Sovereign of the Myriad Forms," the "Stem of the Supreme Ultimate," the "Root of Chaos," the "Realm of Supreme Good," the "Place of Congealment," the "Valley of Emptiness," the "Source of Creation," the "Non-Dual Dharma Gate," the "Profound Dharma Realm," the "Orifice of Returning to the Root," the "Pass of Restoring Life," the "Central Yellow Palace," the "Abode of Profound Stillness," the "Gate of Total Retention," the "Land of Ultimate Bliss," the "Treasury of Emptiness," the "Southwest Region," the "Gate of Wu and Ji," the "Place of True Unity," the "Abode of the Yellow Dame," the "Altar of Guarding the One," the "Pure Land," the "West," the "Yellow Center," the "Rightful Position," the "This," the "Spirit Chamber," the "True Earth," and the "Yellow Court." Such varied names are too numerous to list entirely.

Yet this orifice, sought within the body, is neither mouth nor nose, neither heart nor kidneys, neither liver nor lungs, neither spleen nor stomach, neither navel-wheel nor tailbone, neither bladder nor anus, neither the single cavity between the two kidneys, nor the point one inch and three fen below the navel, neither the Hall of Brightness nor the Muddy Pellet, neither the Pass of Origin nor the Sea of Qi. Then where, indeed, is it to be found?

The Pure Yang Patriarch says:
*"Mysterious Female, Mysterious Female—truly mysterious!
Not in the heart, nor in the kidneys lies she.
Seek where the body first received its breath—
No wonder the celestial mechanism is wholly revealed!"*

Now, speaking in terms of the principle of bodily birth: at the moment when father and mother’s single thought turns to union, round and radiant, that primordial spark of spirit-light strikes the mother’s womb—thus, ○, and nothing more. The Confucians call it *ren* (benevolence), also the *Wuji* (Ultimateless). The Buddhists call it the *pearl*, also *perfect clarity*. The Daoists call it the *elixir*, also *spirit-light*. All refer to this primordial qi, the primal essence of chaos—truly the origin of bodily life, the inception of received breath, the foundation of nature and destiny, the ancestor of all transformations.

When father and mother’s union is complete, essence and blood envelop it externally—thus, ◎, and nothing more. This is what we Confucians call the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). From it arise the five viscera, from it the six bowels, from it the four limbs, from it the hundred bones, from it the faculties of seeing, hearing, grasping, and walking, from it the powers of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, from it the capacities for sageliness, spirit, culture, and martial skill. In the end, the original source of bodily life all issues from that single speck within the Taiji.

The *Triple Concordance* says:
*"The body that man receives
Is fundamentally Nonbeing.
Primal essence spreads like clouds,
Riding qi as its chariot.
When the initial qi congeals in doubt,
The Mysterious Female is established.
Above, it binds the Spirit Pass;
Below, it binds the Sea of Qi.
The Spirit Pass stores the luminous nature of awareness;
The Sea of Qi stores the vital breath of life.
Though nature and destiny divide into the twin strands of dragon and tiger,
Their root is wholly held within the Ancestral Orifice."*

Thus Laozi says: *"The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth."* Why is it called the gate of the Mysterious Female and the root of Heaven and Earth? Is not the Heaven-and-Earth within our body the Mysterious Female? Is not the root of the Heaven-and-Earth within our body the root of the Mysterious Female? Is not the gate of the Mysterious Female within our body the gate of Heaven and Earth? And does not the gate of Heaven and Earth issue from what existed before Heaven and Earth, serving as their root?

Thus the root of Heaven’s qi is what divides Heaven from Earth, and does not the gate of the Mysterious Female issue from what existed before the Mysterious Female, serving as its root? Thus the root of the Mysterious Female is what divides the mysterious from the female. Why is it called *mysterious*? Is it not what emerges from the mother of all particulars? Why is it called *mysterious upon mysterious*? Is it not what issues from the beginning without name?

The beginning without name—the Buddhists point to it as the *Non-Dual Dharma Gate*. Zisi says: *"As a thing, it is not two; thus its generation of things is unfathomable."* Zhuangzi says: *"The luminous is born from the obscure; the ordered is born from the formless."* For one who would awaken to nature and perceive nature, should one seek the luminous and ordered that is to come? Or should one seek the obscure and formless?

The obscure and formless—no trace of it can be discerned. This is what we Confucians call *"without sound, without scent,"* and what the Buddhists call *"before the King of Majestic Sound."* Yet why is it called *King*? What presides over and commands majestic sound is the Taiji—hence it is called *King*. From this I know that those who study immortality or study Buddhism need only seek where the King resides and revere it. To revere the King is one thing; to go beyond and dissolve even the King is to wander in the Taiji and return to the Wuji. The Wuji is the true center.

Thus it is said: *"The sages transmit it to one another in this center."* This center is the *"center"* that Yao and Shun held fast for long, the *"center"* of Confucius’ *"timely mean,"* the *"center"* of Zisi’s *"unmanifest,"* the *"Yellow Center"* of the *Book of Changes,* the *"center"* of *"pervading principle,"* the *"center"* of the *Scripture of Salvation,* the *"center"* of *"regulating the five qi,"* the *"center within emptiness"* of Śākyamuni, and the *"center of guarding"* of Laozi.

Yet the word *"center"* has two meanings. If one says the center has a fixed location, it is *this* center. If one says the center has no fixed location, it is where Qian and Kun unite. Because it can be held fast for long, it is said to have a fixed location. Yet how could this be true only within this one body? Even beyond this body, it pervades Heaven and Earth—all is the center of my heart. How could this be true only within Heaven and Earth? Even beyond Heaven and Earth, it pervades the void—all is the center of my heart.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"It flows through the six voids."* Yet flowing beyond the six voids, it is not deficient; withdrawing and storing itself in the orifice of the body, it is not in excess. Thus it is said: *"One orifice can contain the Great Void."*

The *Scripture of the Way in Emptiness* says: *"The highest point of Heaven is 84,000 li from the lowest point of Earth, and the center of Heaven and Earth lies exactly at the midpoint of 42,000 li."* If the human body is a small Heaven and Earth, then the distance between heart and navel is also eight inches and four fen, and the center of this center lies exactly at the midpoint of four inches and two fen.

This orifice is precisely below *Qian*, above *Kun*, west of *Zhen*, east of *Dui*—where the eight vessels and nine orifices converge, where the channels and collaterals meet, where the two empty cavities suspend the millet-like pearl. It is the true center of the Heaven and Earth within the human body, the orifice that stores the original ancestral qi.

If one knows the orifice but not its subtlety, it is like knowing the center but not the One. As the ancients said: *"The heart is Earth, and nature is the sovereign; the orifice is the center, and subtlety is the One."* The One has many kinds—there is the One of the Dao, the One of spirit, the One of qi, the One of water, the One of number, the One that runs through all, the One of harmonious unity, the One of essential purity, the One of singular focus, the One of guarding, and the One of return. The One of return means returning the One to the center. The One of guarding means guarding the One within the center. Where there is a center, there is a One; but if the One is not the center, it is not the One of which the sages speak. Where there is a One, there is a center; but if the center is not the One, it is not the center of which the sages speak.

Thus, Confucius’s One is the One that runs through the center. Yao and Shun’s center is the center that holds fast to the One. The *River Chart* of Fuxi, with its emptiness at the center, is the primordial—this is the center of the ancestral orifice within the body. Confucius said: *"Before Heaven, act without transgression."* Laozi said: *"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth."* This is what the Buddhists mean when they say: *"Vast and boundless, a single expanse—it is the Great Void."*

The *Luo Inscription* of Yu the Divine, with its fullness at the center, is the later Heaven—this is the One of the ancestral orifice within the body. Confucius said: *"After Heaven, follow the celestial seasons."* Laozi said: *"The named is the mother of the ten thousand things."* This is what the Daoists mean when they speak of *"a trace revealed, a single spark of numinous light."*

Yet the *River Chart* is centered, and its center is never without the One. The *Luo Inscription* is One, and its One is never without the center. The center encompasses the One, and the One presides over the center—is this not the wondrous principle of the subtle and the unfathomable workings of non-action?

The *Scripture of Virtue and the Dao* says: *"Excessive words lead to exhaustion; it is better to guard the center."* The *Cavernous Mystery Scripture* says: *"Ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts are not as good as guarding the One."* The One is the unceasing generativity of benevolence. *The Doctrine of the Mean* says: *"Cultivate the Dao through benevolence."* *The Analects* says: *"The world returns to benevolence."* *The Book of Rites* says: *"At the center of the heart, peace in benevolence."* *The Book of Changes* says: *"Dwell in the soil and nourish benevolence."*

I often compare it to the kernel of a fruit: within the center is a single point, which is the Supreme Ultimate. The two that embrace it are the one yin and one yang. *The Book of Changes* says: *"The Changes have the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes."* Thus, the Changes are the transformation of the Two. The Supreme Ultimate is the numinosity of the One. With this single point of numinosity nurtured within the ancestral orifice, neither diligence nor idleness is permitted—this is called *"settling the spirit."* Is not the ancestral orifice the means to restore the primordial yang of the body?

With this single point of benevolence nurtured within the soil of Kun, neither forgotten nor forced—this is called *"settling the soil."* Is not nurturing benevolence the means to establish the Supreme Ultimate of the body?

Again, like the lotus seed, which has a single thread embraced by two halves—is this not what is meant by *"the One that runs through all"*? One becomes two, two becomes three, and three generates the ten thousand things. Thus, Zhang Ziyang said:
*"The Dao is the Void that generates the primal qi,
From this primal qi arise yin and yang,
Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,
And from the Three Bodies, the ten thousand things flourish."*

Formerly, Master Wen Shi asked Laozi: *"What is the most wondrous and essential method for cultivating the body?"* Laozi replied: *"It lies in deep roots and firm stems—guarding the center and embracing the One, nothing more. What is guarding the center? Diligently guard the center, never letting it stray. Let nothing enter from without, nothing depart from within. Return to the root, and all affairs are complete."*

Thus, Laozi’s *"guarding the center"* means guarding the center of this original substance. The Confucians’ *"holding fast to the center"* means holding fast to the center of this original substance. The Buddhists’ *"emptiness at the center"* means that the center of this original substance is utterly empty. Laozi’s *"embracing the One"* means embracing the One of this original substance. The Buddhists’ *"returning to the One"* means returning to the One of this original substance. The Confucians’ *"One that runs through all"* means using the One of this original substance to thread through all.

*"Only essence, only the One"*—this is what the *Book of Changes* means by *"entering the numinous through essential purity."* *"Long holding fast to the center"*—this is what *The Book of Rites* means by *"the king, the center of the heart, non-action, guarding the utmost correctness."* *"The king, the center of the heart"* refers to this single point of benevolence presiding over the center, called the *"Celestial Sovereign."* What is to be done? Simply guard the utmost correctness.

Fate is established from this, and nature is preserved from this—these two are of the same origin but different names, originally the old matter within the aperture. Now, returning to this aperture, it is what Master Zhuang meant by *"the swift of the Southern Sea and the sudden of the Northern Sea meeting in the land of Chaos."*

Those who cultivate the elixir but do not understand the ancestral aperture will find the true breath unsettled and spiritual transformation without foundation; the medicinal substances incomplete and the great elixir unformed. For this aperture is the gate of total holding, the capital of the ten thousand methods—boundless, without edges, without inside or outside. It cannot be guarded with intention, nor sought without intention. To seek with intention and guard it is to cling to form; to seek without intention is to fall into emptiness. What then is to be done?

Receive the master’s instruction:
*"The boundless void is the mysterious aperture;
Knowing yet not guarding is the work."*

Constantly place the true self at rest within it—thus, thus unmoving, silent yet alert, forgetting both inner and outer, merged into effortlessness. Then spirit clings to qi and congeals; fate clings to nature and abides. Without returning to the One, the One returns of itself; without guarding the center, the center guards itself. When the heart of the center is full, the hearts of the Five Agents are empty—this is the original intent of Laozi’s *"embracing the One and guarding the center, emptying the heart and filling the belly."*

Zhang Ziyang said:
*"Emptying the heart and filling the belly—both meanings run deep,
Only because to empty the heart, one must first know the heart."*

Liu Haichan said:
*"The central chamber of spirit is fundamentally at ease,
For the true qi of prior heaven arrives of itself."*

Lü Chunyang said:
*"Only by mastering the art of guarding the center does one fathom its mystery;
Only by embracing the One without words does one see its excellence."*

Xu Zuoqing said:
*"Swiftly roaming, returning to Chaos,
Dragon and tiger coil within the Yellow Center."*

Elder of True Yang said:
*"To know the true place of the golden elixir,
Cultivate where the body has not yet arisen."*

Ru Ru Layman said:
*"Above Kun, below Qian,
Between them, a treasure beyond price."*

Li Qing’an’s *Zhonghe Collection* said:
*"The two contain the beginning, dividing into the Three Ultimates;
Qian stands upright, Kun opens and closes.
Between heaven and earth lies the Mysterious Female’s gate—
The more it moves, the more it issues; the more it stills, the more it enters."*

Wang Yuyang’s *Collected Radiance* said:
*"From this, the Valley Spirit establishes the root of heaven;
The sages call it the Mysterious Female’s gate.
Piercing the world’s life-and-death knot,
True immortals determine heaven and earth within it."*

Tan Chuduan’s *Water Cloud Collection* said:
*"Yin resides above, yang below;
Yang qi rises first, yin qi follows.
Where tiger and dragon mate in union,
It is like crossing a small bridge."*

He Shanggong’s *Passing Brightness Collection* said:
*"Dim and obscure, opening the ten thousand wonders;
Vague and indistinct, preserving the true aperture.
Gathered, it hides within a single grain;
Released, it scatters beyond the Six Directions."*

Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* said:
*"The thunder dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li region,
The Dui tiger’s metal is born in the Kan direction.
These two are but the child giving birth to the mother—
The Five Agents must enter the center to be born."*

Zhang Jinghe’s *Pillow Records* said:
*"The primordial aperture is prior heaven,
Within it, emptiness and nothingness govern naturally.
If you see it before birth,
You will surely become a Great Luo Immortal."*

Master Ge’s *Song of the Mysterious* said:
*"Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center,
The center lies in emptiness, vast and open.
Gather dragon and tiger within the aperture,
And the pivot of creation rests in your grasp."*

Luo Gongyuan’s *Playing with the Nine* said:
*"An aperture of emptiness and nothingness amid heaven and earth,
Intimate and secret, no wind passes through.
Vague and indistinct, without color or form,
The true person now appears within the jeweled pearl."*

Tianlaizi’s *White Tiger Song* said:
*"The gate of the Mysterious Female stands open all day,
Within it, an aperture blends the numinous terrace.
No locks, no bolts, no one to guard it—
Sun and moon east and west come and go of themselves."*

Zhang Hongmeng’s *Returning to the Origin* said:
*"The root of heaven and earth begins with the Mysterious Female;
Inhaling the sun, exhaling the moon, grasp the handle.
Hidden and manifest—both empty, yet not empty—
Seek it and it is not seen; call it and it responds."*

Gao Xiangxian’s *Golden Elixir Song* said:
*"What is the Way of the One?
Better first to knock at the gate of Wu and Ji.
Within the gate of Wu and Ji lies true water—
True water is the root of the yellow sprout."*

Ding Yeh’s *Free and Easy Wandering* said:
*"The three teachings share one origin, this perfect circle,
Born in non-action, prior to the image of the Lord.
If you awaken to the true wondrous principle within,
You will know the ancestral root of the Great Dao."*

Master Xiao’s *Secret of the Great Elixir* said:
*"If a student seeks the yellow sprout,
The two roots share one home.
Seven returns, nine refinements—know the master,
For the work allows not the slightest error."*

Li Lingyang’s *Song of the Ancestral Aperture* said:
*"Each and every one holds the inexhaustible treasury,
Each and every one’s original substance is emptiness.
Do not say only Gautama’s name is Ultimate Bliss—
The joy of Confucius and Yan Hui lies within it."*

Chen Zhixu’s *Turning Words Gatha* said:
*"The One is called the Non-Dual Gate;
Entering it, you find your true abode.
When Master Zeng once uttered a single ‘yes,’
How many in Jambudvīpa were led astray?"*

Xue Zixian’s *Empty Center Poem* said:
*"Between heaven and earth, it is like a bellows—
Know that the one who pumps it is none other.
From this, the root and source of movement and stillness are obtained;
See for yourself—when you let go, is there wind or not?"*

Master Lü’s *Pure Yang Collected Works* said:
*"Yin and yang, two things hidden in subtlety—
Only because foolish disciples do not know.
Truly taking them for male and female,
Truly calling them Kan and Li—how mistaken!"*

Li Daochun’s *Song of No One* said:
*"The Dao is fundamentally empty, giving birth to the Supreme Ultimate;
The Supreme Ultimate transforms, and the One arises first.
The One divides into Two, Two gives birth to Three—
From this, the Four Images and Five Agents emerge."*

Master Shouya’s *Recorded Sayings* said:
*"The Dharma gate of Tāraṇī is wondrous and inexhaustible,
Buddha after Buddha transmits only this.
Not knowing the true meaning of the Western coming,
In vain do they wear iron sandals, wandering east and west."*

Ma Danyang’s *Drunken Chant* said:
*"Laozi’s golden elixir, the Buddha’s pearl—
Perfectly bright, without lack or excess.
The gate of death and door of life stem from this aperture;
This aperture alone can contain the Great Void."*

Cao Wenyi’s *Song of the Great Dao* said:
*"I ask you, true person—where do you come from?
From the beginning, you have dwelled only in the numinous terrace."*

In former years, clouds and mist deeply obscured;
Today we meet, and the Dao-eye opens.

*Master Liu Changsheng’s* *Immortal Elixir Collection* says:
*"One aperture—void and empty—is the Mysterious Female Gate,
Its rhythm and seasons ever tempered, ever warm.
Within the immortal’s crucible, no other medicine exists;
Base metals melt away to forge a hundred-times-refined gold."*

*Master Li Daochun’s* *Central Harmony Collection* says:
*"Heaven and Earth open and close without cease,
Li and Kan rise and fall, unite and part.
For you, gentlemen, I now make clear:
The thought-moment is the outer foundation of the elixir."*

*Master Liu Haichan’s* *Song of Seeing the Dao* says:
*"The Pass of Han’gu stands at the center of Heaven and Earth,
Where sun and moon come and go from west to east.
Try gazing through a slender tube into the Mysterious Aperture—
Tiger crouched, dragon coiled, its qi majestic and grand."*

*Master Wuchang’s* *Secret Instructions* says:
*"Once you awaken to the Valley Spirit and penetrate this Dao,
Who can master human desires and cultivate the true?
Brightly I speak of the Central Yellow Path—
In the thunder’s roar, the spirit is naturally attained."*

*Perfected Bai Yuchan* says:
*"Root of nature, stem of life—
Same origin, different names, divided into two kinds.
When united in one place to form the elixir,
It returns to the primordial, precelestial qi."*

*Perfected Zhao Yuandu* says:
*"The Void’s single aperture stands at the center,
Neither born nor destroyed, naturally inexhaustible.
Luminous yet formless, boundless yet empty—
Profound and obscure, yet not truly empty."*

*Perfected Zhang Ziyang’s* *Preface to the Golden Elixir* says:
*"This aperture is no ordinary aperture,
Formed by the union of Heaven and Earth.
Called the Cavern of Spirit and Qi,
Within it lies the essence of Kan and Li."*

*Perfected Yingchan Li’s* *Eulogy on the Dao and Its Virtue* says:
*"Opening and closing in accord with Heaven and Earth,
This is the Mysterious Female Gate.
Since there is no exit or entrance,
It alone is honored across the Three Realms."*

*Master Sima Ziwei* says:
*"The Void’s single aperture is named the Mysterious Pass,
Right within the human body, between Heaven and Earth.
Eighty-four thousand divisions mark its upper and lower bounds,
Nine, three, six, and five arrayed in cycles.
Vast as the Dharma Realm, yet without trace,
Subtle as dust, yet its face unseen.
This is called the Cavern of Ancestral Qi,
Where a single grain of millet hangs at the center."*

The above oral instructions all elucidate the wonders of the Ancestral Aperture.

Laozi said: *"Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?"*
Zhuangzi said: *"The pivot finds its place within the ring, responding endlessly."*
It is said: *"Occupy the correct position within the body’s crucible."*
It is said: *"Occupy the correct position to congeal the root of life."*
It is said: *"The noble person’s thoughts do not stray from their proper place."*
Mencius also said: *"Establish the world’s correct position—only this is the correct position."*
Speaking of its greatness, it suffices to encompass
Heaven and Earth without boundary.
Thus it is called the Vast Abode, and the Great Dao emerges from it.

The *Mao Odes* says: *"Hold fast to a heart as deep as an abyss."*
The *Great Mystery Classic* says: *"Conceal the heart in the abyss to beautify its numinous root."*
The *Triple Concordance* says: *"The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and wandering while guarding the center."*
"Seal," "conceal"—these express the meaning of hiding and guarding.
Yet the two words "floating and wandering" must not be overlooked.
"Floating and wandering" means ease and leisure—
Just as Mencius spoke of *"neither forgetting nor forcing,"*
And the Buddha’s *"abide thus, thus tame the mind,"*—this is the same meaning.

**The Work of the Dharma Wheel’s Self-Turning** *(Diagram of the Self-Turning Dharma Wheel)*

The three teachings’ Dharma gates share a single path though their traces differ;
Though their forms diverge into three, their principle is one.
Viewed thus, the work:
Buddhists call it the *"Dharma Wheel,"*
Daoists call it *"Circulating Heaven,"*
Confucians call it *"Walking the Courtyard."*

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Stopping at the back, one does not encounter the self;
Walking the courtyard, one does not see others—no blame."*
"Walking the courtyard" is the movement of *"Heaven’s ceaseless vigor."*
Heaven’s movement—one revolution per day—how vigorous it is!
If our body is also a small Heaven and Earth,
Then its revolution is the vigor of *"Circulating Heaven."*

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Heaven’s movement is vigorous; the noble person ceaselessly strengthens himself."*
Yet within our body, the Yellow Court and Great Ultimate stand firm,
While Heaven revolves around them, coming and going without end.

The *Gèn* hexagram says:
*"When it is time to stop, stop—then the Great Ultimate stands firm.
When it is time to move, move—then Circulating Heaven proceeds."*
Have you not observed the *Appended Judgments*?
It says: *"Sun and moon push each other to generate light."*
It also says: *"Cold and heat push each other to complete the year."*
It also says: *"Bending and stretching respond to each other to produce benefit."*
This is the heart-method of *"walking the courtyard."*

What is *"establishing the pole"*?
It is what was previously called *"the heart’s benevolence settled at the center,"*
The *"center of earth"* that nurtures and fosters,
Possessing the true mechanism of ebb and flow.
Thus body and heart, nature and life, merge as one.

One bending, one stretching; one going, one coming—
Truly like the sun and moon alternating brightness,
Cold and heat interchanging their course,
As if the natural movement of Heaven’s revolution—
This is also our body’s own Heaven and Earth.

At first, there is intention; in the end, no intention.
Initially, use intention to guide the qi, revolving from center to periphery,
From small to great.
Silently recite the twelve-character incantation:
*"The White Tiger hides in the East; the Azure Dragon lurks in the West."*
One phrase per revolution, repeating thirty-six times before stopping.

When drawing it back, revolve from periphery to center,
From great to small,
Also reciting the incantation:
*"The Azure Dragon lurks in the West; the White Tiger hides in the East."*
Again thirty-six times, returning to the Great Ultimate to stop—
This is one *"Circulating Heaven."*

With time, intention is no longer needed;
Naturally, the celestial mechanism turns without cease,
The Dharma Wheel self-rotating—
Truly a point where one cannot stop.

*Master Quanyang* says:
*"Revolving with the sun and moon,
Turning with the Milky Way."*
Endless turning, endless life.

The *Chanting the Dao Collection* says:
*"At ease and content, the Way of long life—
Day and night, soundlessly, the Dharma Wheel turns."*

*Master Han Xiaoyao* says:
*"The Dharma Wheel must turn—always turn!
Only within the body, unseen by others.
When set in motion, it resembles the sun’s wheel,
The sun’s wheel turning toward me within my body."*
He also says:
*"Let the Dharma Wheel turn without cease,
Thought after thought, the wheel turns of itself."*

When it turns, it is vast like clouds and mist filling all directions, swift like a storm’s sudden arrival, fleeting like waking from a daydream, and dissolving like heavy illness leaving the body. The spirit merges in harmony, like the union of husband and wife; bones and flesh fuse as one, like rising from a bath. The *Book of Changes* says: *"Yellow-centered, it penetrates principle, rightly positioned within the body—its beauty lies within, yet flows through the four limbs."* These words are truly trustworthy.

**Method of Dragon-Tiger Intercourse (Diagram of Dragon-Tiger Intercourse)**
For humans, when Kan and Li unite, life arises; when they separate, death follows. This is an inevitable principle, without exception. Li, composed of three yang lines, resides in the south—yang outwardly, yin inwardly—called "true mercury." Kan, composed of three yin lines, resides in the north—yin outwardly, yang inwardly—called "true lead." Thus, the Perfected One of Purple Yang says: *"The sun dwells in Li’s position yet becomes female; Kan matches the Moon Palace yet is male."* This speaks of Kan’s maleness and Li’s femaleness, like a father’s essence and a mother’s blood; the sun’s crow and the moon’s hare; mercury of cinnabar and silver of lead; heaven’s mystery and earth’s yellow. These all point to the two qi of Dragon and Tiger.

The *Triplex Unity* says: *"Li is the sun’s light; Kan is the moon’s essence."* Thus, Li’s *si* (巳) symbolizes the Dragon’s yang qi, and Kan’s *wu* (戊) symbolizes the Tiger’s yang qi. Now, *wu* and *si* are the true earth of the Yellow Court, which, when the Great Ultimate first divided, came to reside within the two bodies of Dragon and Tiger. For those who cultivate the elixir, if they wish to return to their origin and restore their beginning, making Dragon and Tiger return to the crucible, temperament and nature return to the cavity, they must employ the two secrets: *"the Dragon emerges from fire, the Tiger is born from water."* Then, from the raging flames, the soaring Dragon leaps forth; from the deep, clear waters, the prowling Tiger springs—only then do Dragon and Tiger unite, stealthily returning to primordial chaos. Next, husband and wife merge as one, passing from the indistinct into the void, together entering the Yellow Chamber, mutually consuming each other, their passions entwined, the two qi intertwining—like heaven and earth mating in essence, the sun and moon exchanging light, coiling within the ancestral cavity. Naturally, they restore the pre-heavenly, undivided qi and form the primordial, true unity of essence. This becomes the root-source of the great medicine, the foundation of the returning elixir.

Now, the Dragon’s temperament and nature always reside in *wu*, while the Tiger’s essence and nature always reside in *si*. Only because each possesses earth qi, when the two earths combine, they form the *daogui* (knife-spoon). Thus, when Kan and Li unite, earth and heaven are in harmony; when Dragon and Tiger unite, *wu* and *si* merge. When *wu* and *si* unite as one, the four images converge to produce the great medicine. The *Book of Changes* says: *"Heaven and earth intermingle in misty union, and the myriad things transform in purity; male and female mate in essence, and the myriad things transform in life."* Heaven and earth generate beings through the intercourse of yin and yang; the elixir method produces medicine through the intercourse of yin and yang. Truly, there has never been creation without intercourse.

The *Book of Jade Mushrooms* says: *"If the mysterious and yellow do not unite, how can yang fly up from beneath Kan?"* This is the great beginning of elixir-making, the foremost principle of immortal cultivation. If the qi of heaven and earth do not intermingle, sweet dew will not descend; if the bodies of Kan and Li do not merge, the yellow sprout will not grow. If the yang qi of Dragon and Tiger do not unite, the true single seed will not be produced. Without the true single seed, what will serve as the handle to congeal the golden liquid great elixir?

Now, the principle of intercourse has two aspects: internal and external. The union of Kan and Li, Dragon and Tiger, is internal intercourse—it produces the medicine. The union of Qian and Kun, zi and wu, is external intercourse—it coagulates the elixir. These two methods differ as heaven and abyss; scholars must discern them carefully.

Zhang Ziyang says: *"Once the two substances are driven into the Yellow Path, how can the golden elixir fail to form?"* This is the meaning. Lü Chunshu says: *"When the two substances meet, it is the root of the Dao; when the five phases are complete, it is called the elixir."* This is the meaning. Chen Baoyi says: *"When *wu* and *si* suddenly unite, temperament and nature merge; when Kan and Li first mate, Dragon and Tiger descend."* This is the meaning. Zhang Yongcheng says: *"Tiger leaps, Dragon soars—waves surge; in the central, rightful position, the mysterious pearl is born."* This is the meaning. Zhang Pingshu’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *"The Dragon comes from the Eastern Sea, the Tiger rises from the Western Mountain; the two beasts battle fiercely, then transform into a pool of water."* This, too, is the meaning.

The intercourse of Dragon and Tiger is the method of the three origins uniting as one—thus gathering Qian and Kun, uniting Kan and Li, assembling yin and yang, merging nature and life, causing the two to revert and become one. From this, the nine palaces, eight trigrams, seven luminaries, six positions, five phases, four images, and three talents—all born of the two—return to the two. The One is *"the thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth."* Great indeed is the One! In its flow, it is called *qi*; in its coagulation, it is called essence; in its wondrous function, it is called spirit.

Originally, when the Great Ultimate first divided, they came to reside within two bodies. As days passed and distance grew, they neared peril. Thus, the sage grasps the essentials of heaven and earth, knows the source of transformation, gathers essence from the water palace, and summons spirit at the numinous pass. Returning them to the cavity of the mysterious female, they meet with the ancestral *qi*, the three families reunite, merging into one. First, spirit congeals in chaos; next, stillness illumines the void. Embracing the One without separation—this is the wondrous Dao of returning to the origin.

The *Book of Documents* says: *"The human heart is perilous; the heart of Dao is subtle. Only through refinement and unity can one truly hold to the center."*

Here the heart and essence unite as one, converging at the center of the Yellow Center. To truly hold fast to this is how Yao and Shun opened the transmission of the Dao lineage, becoming the ancestral fountainhead of sagely learning for ten thousand ages.

**Section Three Oral Instructions of the *Wondrous Pointers on Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life*: Concealing in the Qi Cavern, Myriad Wonders Return to the Root**
*(Diagram of Concealing in the Qi Cavern)*
*(Includes four methods: moving, staying, sitting, reclining)*

The previous section spoke of gathering and converging as the work of guarding the center and embracing the One; this section speaks of concealing as the oral instruction for deepening the root and firming the stem. Gathering and concealing are outer and inner to each other—without gathering, there can be no diffusion; without concealing, there can be no generation. Thus, these two sections flow as one, inseparable.

This instruction has no other method: simply take that point of yang spirit congealed within the ancestral cavity and conceal it within the qi cavern, called "sending it back to the earthen cauldron" and sealing it firmly. It is also called "congealing spirit into the qi cavern." This cavern has two apertures, inner and outer: the outer aperture is likened to the pit of a peach or apricot, the inner aperture to the kernel within the pit. An ancient immortal said:

*Before chaos was born, chaos was round,
The message within cannot be conveyed.
Split open the aperture within the aperture,
Tread through heaven within heaven beyond heaven.*

This aperture within the aperture—the Tathāgata called it "emptiness yet not empty," the *tathāgatagarbha*. The Old Master named it "mysterious yet again mysterious." Master Hai Chan of the Myriad Wonders Gate also called it "bottomless," "a bellows with holes," "the key within the lock." No one has grasped it—this refers to the aperture within the aperture.

This aperture is the source of yin and yang, the dwelling of spirit and qi, the root of fetal breathing, the origin of respiration. The womb is the palace that conceals spirit; breath is the source that transforms the womb. The womb is born from breath; breath abides through the womb. And the aperture within the aperture is the true place where immortals lengthen the womb and abide in breath.

Yet the vastness of heaven and earth is but one womb, and the coming and going of the sun and moon, the rotation of the Dipper’s handle—this is true breath. Have you not observed the books of the Three Teachings?

The *Book of Changes* says: *"Preserving the inherent nature unceasingly—this is the gate of Dao and virtue."*
The *Dao De Jing* says: *"Mysterious yet again mysterious—this is the gate of myriad wonders."*
The *Sutra of Bequeathed Teachings* says: *"Restraining it to one place, nothing remains unordered."*

All directly point to the true person’s place of respiration within us. Then where is the true person’s place of respiration? I once heard in the scriptures:

*The obscure and dark palace that stores primordial essence,
The cinnabar palace where fetal breath is knotted—
Above red, below black, left black, right white,
In the yellow haze at the center—this is the true person’s place of respiration.*

It lies precisely behind the navel wheel, before the kidney hall, below the Yellow Court, above the Pass of Origin—just as the *Yellow Court Classic* says: *"Above is the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin; behind is the Dark Gate, before the Gate of Life."* Liao Chan Hui said: *"Before facing the navel wheel, behind facing the kidneys, between them is the true golden tripod."*

Once you recognize this place, settle the spirit you have congealed into the aperture within the aperture—like a turtle concealing itself, a snake hibernating, a clam containing its light, a toad absorbing its breath. Ceaseless yet unforced, neither forgotten nor assisted, as if present yet not present, as if absent yet not absent. Draw it in and gather it to the land of nowhere; move it and conceal it in the place of opening and closing. Breaths enfold each other, spirit and qi embrace, knotting into the mother of elixir, anchored in the lower field.

Externally, it summons the upright qi of heaven and earth’s numinous yang; internally, it captures and restrains the essence of the body’s lead and mercury. Like the North Star’s abode, all stars encircle it. With time, spirit and qi return to the root, nature and life unite as one, and the great medicine gestates within.

Yet congealing spirit and regulating breath both have oral instructions. Without them, the spirit of thought and deliberation may recklessly merge with the qi of respiration, forming an illusory elixir that harms the medicinal substances. Thus, the immortal elder said:

*"To regulate breath, regulate the true breath;
To refine spirit, refine the spirit that is not spirit."*

The *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Convergence Classic* says: *"People know the spirit’s spirituality but do not know the spirituality of the non-spirit."* The non-spirit is nature. Nature is the root of spirit; spirit arises from nature, yet nature was never originally spirit. The luminous clarity within spirit that does not dim—this is true nature.

The *Immortals’ Great Dao Song* says: *"I tell you all the truth: the stem of life has always been in the true breath."* True breath is life. Life is the stem of qi; the stem arises from life, yet life was never originally qi. The misty swirling within qi that does not cease—this is true life.

This spirit that is not spirit and that breath that is true breath—only these two are the true husband and wife, true yin and yang, true dragon and tiger, true nature and life. Twisted into one strand, blended into one place, forged into one piece, tempered in one furnace, they are variously named: the meeting of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, the union of female and male, the shared den of crow and hare, the shared palace of sun and moon, the merging of hun and po, the fusion of gold and fire. In the end, it is nothing but the method of congealing spirit and uniting qi.

Thus, spirit does not leave qi, qi does not leave spirit. When the spirit and qi of our body unite, then the nature and life of our body appear. Nature does not leave life, life does not leave nature. When the nature and life of our body unite, then the nature that was never originally nature and the life that was never originally life appear.

Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* says: *"It is nature and life, not spirit and qi. Spoken of provisionally, they are two; spoken of in reality, they are one."* Spirit and qi are certainly not two things; nature and life must be dually cultivated.

Yet the essential teaching of dual cultivation has long been lost in transmission, giving rise to contentious debates between the Daoist and Chan schools. As Liu Haichan said: *"Truly, the Buddha-Dharma is the Dao—one child held by two."* The Venerable Qinghe observed: *"The dual cultivation of nature and life is transmitted beyond the teachings; within it, the mysterious is wondrously mysterious. Gathering the Primordial Beginning to return to the Non-Beginning, reversing the prior-heaven to become the posterior-heaven."* This profound subtlety cannot be fathomed without a teacher; its oral instructions are arcane and minute, to be detailed later. For now, I shall speak only of what the various immortals have realized, making it easier for beginners to awaken and enter.

According to Bai Yuchan: *"In former days, I received the teacher’s oral instructions: simply concentrate the spirit and enter the qi-cavity."* The qi-cavity is the inner aperture. Hibernating the spirit within it, concealing the qi inside, one unites the Tathāgata’s empty-empty heart with the Perfected One’s deep-deep breath. Thus, heart and breath depend on each other; as the breath is regulated, the heart becomes pure. For when a single point of true heart is nurtured within the qi, this is the method of congealing the spirit and entering the qi-cavity.

Once the spirit is congealed within the qi-cavity, one must constantly turn the light inward to illuminate it. With unceasing attention, the natural rotation begins: the true breath ascends and descends, and water, fire, wood, and metal advance and retreat in turn. The immortal adage says: *"To attain longevity, first practice prolonged gazing."* Gazing long at the upper elixir field, the spirit attains longevity; gazing long at the middle elixir field, the qi attains longevity; gazing long at the lower elixir field, the form attains longevity.

Just as the sun and moon illuminate heaven and earth, when the clam absorbs them, it produces a pearl; when the unyielding stone stores them, it yields jade. How much more does the human body possess its own sun and moon—can it not turn the light inward to congeal its own pearl and produce its own beautiful jade?

Yet spirit is fire, and qi is water. Too much water extinguishes fire; too much fire dries up water. Most people in middle age suffer from water failing to overcome fire. Thus, one must early replenish life and early add oil. The method of adding oil was recorded earlier under *"The Treasure of Safeguarding Life."* Now, speaking further, the principle of heaven and humanity as one qi is fully revealed.

Between heaven and humanity, there is only the mutual opening and closing of a single qi, their mutual connection—nothing more. Thus, when I exhale, the qi of heaven and earth disperses forth; when I inhale, the qi of heaven and earth gathers in. This is the subtlety of heaven and humanity’s mutual resonance, the interflow of a single qi. Therefore, heaven and earth endure long because their breath circulates within. If humans can emulate heaven and earth’s inner breathing, they too may share their longevity.

Immortal Cao the Matriarch said: *"Cultivating primordial harmony within achieves the true; practicing external breathing never ends."* The coming and going of breath through mouth and nose is external breathing; the opening and closing of the qi of Qian and Kun is internal breathing. Xiao Liaozhen said: *"Laozi clearly opened the gate of all mysteries—one opening, one closing, responding to Qian and Kun. Truly, in the formless and imageless, there is the appearance of eternal life without death."* This refers to internal breathing.

Zhang Pingshu said: *"The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world; do not mistakenly apply it to mouth and nose. Even if you practice breath control for a thousand years, how can you seize the golden crow and lunar hare?"* This rebukes external breathing. External breathing pertains to the physical body, sustaining the posterior-heaven to nourish the form. Internal breathing pertains to the Dharma-body, cultivating the prior-heaven to nourish the Valley Spirit.

The breath of internal breathing originally arises from the Mandate of Heaven; only things of the same kind can intimately connect. Thus, the sages employed the method of subduing qi to seize the harmonious impulse of the prior-heaven and earth, reversing it upward through the double passes. Returning from before to after, it reaches the root. Causing the mother’s qi to subdue the child’s qi, mother and child become affectionately entwined. Then, with each breath returning to the root, it becomes the mother of the golden elixir.

The ancients said: *"Subduing qi does not mean ingesting qi; ingesting qi requires subduing qi. Ingesting qi does not lead to longevity; longevity requires subduing qi."* When qi accumulates below, with no place to penetrate, it naturally ascends to the Sea of Marrow. When it accumulates above, with nowhere to flee, it naturally descends to the Sea of Qi. The two qi meet and circulate endlessly. The ancient adepts who attained longevity did so precisely through this method of reversal. This method must not be abandoned from beginning to end.

At the outset, it has the function of salvation, protection, and supplementation; in the second stage, the function of flowing wu to join ji; in the third stage, the function of adding oil to replenish life; in the fourth stage, the function of assisting fire to carry metal; in the fifth stage, when the fire blazes, the function of providing relief; in the sixth stage, when the embryo forms, the function of bathing; in the seventh stage, the function of warming and nurturing, of nursing. Once the infant is rescued from the sea of suffering, one reaches the shore and no longer needs the boat—this effort is then no longer needed.

Moreover, at the beginning of human life, with the cutting of the umbilical cord, the fragile nature and life immediately fall into the true person’s breathing place. Thereafter, they reside between heaven and earth; and further thereafter, within the heart of the fleshly mass.

And further thereafter, it scatters into the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, the four limbs, and the hundred bones. Day by day, the spirit drifts and qi disperses—this is the path to death. Thus, the immortals, in employing the method of return and subjugation to save people, must first teach them to revert to the root. What is reverting to the root? It is to take what has scattered into the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, four limbs, and hundred bones and return it once more to the heart within the fleshly mass—this is called nurturing the original source. Then, what has been nurtured within the heart of the fleshly mass is returned again to the space between heaven and earth—this is called settling the spirit in the ancestral aperture. Further, what has gathered in the space between heaven and earth is returned once more to the true person’s breathing place—this is called hibernating and concealing in the qi cavern. Day by day, the spirit congeals and qi gathers—this is the path to life.

The ancient immortals said: *"A broken house is easy to repair; withered medicine is not hard to revive. But know the method of return and subjugation, and gold and treasure will accumulate like mountains."* At this time, the dried body is replenished, the qi count is reconnected, the life bestowed by one’s parents is preserved, and the endowment of heaven is fulfilled. Only then does true mercury reach eight taels, and true lead finally suffice to half a catty. When the infant’s heart is like that of a newborn, yin and yang kiss in union, undifferentiated as primordial chaos, the exhalation faint, the inhalation soft and unbroken—gradually entering, gradually softening; gradually harmonizing, gradually settling—over time, the movement within the aperture stills of itself, the inner qi does not exit, and the outer qi instead enters. This is the beginning of fetal breathing’s return to the origin, the inception of all wonders converging at the root.

Lü Zhichang said: *"A single breath momentarily stilled can seize the creative power of heaven and earth."* Cheng Yi said: *"Without stealing the mechanism of creation, how can one attain longevity?"* Weng Baoguang said: *"A moment’s effort corresponds to a year’s qi count in heaven and earth."* Were these three elders speaking empty words?

At the wondrous moment when fetal breathing congeals, there is no accumulation upon inhalation, no dispersion upon exhalation. The body and form become empty, and one merges into stillness. With stillness prolonged, inner and outer unite, movement and quiescence both vanish. The celestial wheel halts, sun and moon align, ten thousand li of yin settle into the harmony of spring, and the nine heavens clear to reveal the congealing of dew’s essence. Wondrous indeed! Here, at this moment, appears the true scene of yin and yang’s mutual resonance. Primordial essence spills forth its blossom, and refined gold emerges from the ore. This is the reopening of primordial chaos, the reentry into the womb, the blooming of the flawless flower, the fruition of bodhi—none but those with immortal bones from past lives can fathom the subtlety of this Dao.

*"Behind the secret door lies the gate of former lives; the breath holds sun and moon within."* This is the oral instruction from the *Huangting Waijing Jing*. *"Only at the true person’s breathing place, let the maiden of cinnabar fly to and fro."* This is the oral instruction from Li Changyuan’s *Hunyuan Baozhang*. *"Inwardly join the true qi and preserve the breath, and naturally the workings of creation will restore youthful countenance."* This is the oral instruction from Xu Jingyang’s *Zuisi Xian Ge*. *"The Western Golden Mother, most firm and unyielding, hides within the watery abode of ren."* This is the oral instruction from Shi Xinglin’s *Huanyuan Pian*. *"To know the profound principle of the great Dao’s subtlety, the sun moves into the bright moon’s midst."* This is the oral instruction from Xue Zixian’s *Fuming Pian*. *"The former sages revealed the purport of the cinnabar terrace; how many times has the numinous bird nested in the osmanthus bough?"* This is the oral instruction from Liu Haichan’s *Huánjīn Piān*. *"Two numinous things naturally harmonize; the seed of divine mechanism is sought here."* This is the oral instruction from Chen Moran’s *Chongzheng Pian*. *"The voice of the ancient Buddha transcends movement and stillness; the breath of the true person drifts like gossamer."* This is the oral instruction from Shi Jianyuan’s *Qinglian Jing*. *"A single breath gradually follows the boundless thought; half-awake, one faintly senses the body floating."* This is the oral instruction from Luo Nian’an’s *Taixi Pian*. *"The exhalation does not follow the ten thousand conditions; the inhalation does not dwell in the skandhas."* This is the oral instruction from the Venerable Prajña in response to the King of East India.

*"Mercury fills the gourd to the brim; seal its mouth and place it in deep water."* This is the oral instruction from È Lǜhua’s *Qixue Tu*. *"All things that live must die; the primordial spirit, though dead, revives. Return the spirit to the qi cavern, and the elixir path naturally succeeds."* This is the oral instruction from Shi Xinglin. *"The root has its aperture for returning; the mandate has its pass for restoration. Tread through these two mechanisms, and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood is as effortless as leisure."* This is the oral instruction from Li Qing’an.

*"The heart’s thought is wondrous, the intent profound; between the navel, the primordial qi coalesces into the elixir. The Valley Spirit does not die because of fetal breathing; the gate of longevity requires unbroken continuity."* This is the oral instruction from the *Qunxian Zhuyu*. *"Focus the qi to nourish the spirit, and it lingers long; the true breath comes and goes of itself, leisurely. Unbroken and meandering, it returns to the origin of life; without drawing from the numinous spring, it flows eternally."* This is the oral instruction from Master Haichan.

*"A straight path few seek; wind-tiger and cloud-dragon roar in song. Sit firmly and know the master of qi circulation—the true person’s breath deepens once more."* This is the oral instruction from Chen Zhixu. *"Round yet not round, square yet not square; the forests of heaven and earth secretly enfold. Now, inner and outer are two layers of white, the body abides in the central yellow point."* This is the oral instruction from the *Dacheng Ji*. *"Breath regulated, heart purified, guard the Yellow Court; the entire *Yuanjue Jing* is perfectly complete. Realizing that this body is but illusion through kalpas, on the meditation cushion, one must remain alert."* This is the oral instruction from the *Baopuzi*.

*"Cultivate the womb and navel in emptiness, and let the primordial spirit dwell within. Breath comes and goes without interruption, and the sacred embryo is perfected, merging with the primordial beginning."* This is the oral instruction from Chen Xubai. *"Carefully observe the books of the sages of the Three Teachings—the character ‘breath’ is the simplest and most direct. If one works on the breath, becoming Buddha or immortal requires no effort. Penetrating conditions to reach the root is the Chan mechanism; calming the heart to clarify principle is the Confucian ultimate; congealing qi to refine the spirit is the Daoist mystery. These three breaths, mutually dependent, leave nothing unaccomplished."*

These are the oral instructions from *The Central Harmony Collection* by Li Daochun.

**The Womb-Breathing Formula**
*The Womb-Breathing Formula* by Yuan Tiangang:
The primordial qi is the root of the great Dao and the mother of Heaven and Earth. One yin and one yang give birth to the myriad things. In humans, it is the qi of breathing; in Heaven, it is the qi of cold and heat. That which alters the qi of the four seasons is wu and ji. In spring, it resides in xun, giving life to the myriad things. In summer, it resides in kun, nurturing the myriad things. In autumn, it resides in qian, ripening the myriad things. In winter, it resides in gen, preserving the myriad things. Thus, those who study the Dao should absorb the proper qi of the four seasons into the womb, forming the true seed. With long accumulation, the heart becomes settled, the spirit becomes settled, and the breath becomes settled. The dragon and tiger unite, and the sacred embryo is perfected—this is called the true womb-breathing of the perfected.

*The Womb-Breathing Formula* of the Primordial People:
The Dao is simply the Great Void. Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, all emerge from the Great Void. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the true womb of the Great Void, and the sun and moon are the true breath of the Great Void. If one’s body becomes one with the Great Void, then Heaven and Earth are one’s womb, the sun and moon are one’s breath, and the all-encompassing Great Void is one’s own embrace. Is this not what is meant by transcending Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, to merge with the undifferentiated Void? Ah, how profound is this entry!

*The Womb-Breathing Sutra* of Patriarch Bodhidharma:
The embryo forms from subdued qi, and the qi rests within the formed embryo. Qi entering the body is called life; the spirit departing the form is called death. Knowing that spirit and qi can grant longevity, firmly guard emptiness and nurture spirit and qi. Where the spirit moves, the qi moves; where the spirit abides, the qi abides. If one desires longevity, let spirit and qi flow into each other. The heart does not stir with thoughts—no coming, no going, no exiting, no entering—naturally abiding forever. Diligently practice this, and it is the true path.

*The Womb-Breathing Formula* by Zhang Jinghe:
True mystery, true gate—self-exhaling, self-inhaling. Like fish in a spring pond, like hibernating insects, the vast qi merges harmoniously, the numinous wind gently stirs. Neither turbid nor clear, neither mouth nor nose—no going, no coming, no exiting, no entering. Returning to the root and restoring the origin—this is true womb-breathing.

*The Womb-Breathing Formula* by Wang Ziqiao:
Those who uphold the Dao must carefully observe the four times of zi, wu, mao, and you, for these are the gates of yin and yang’s entry and exit. A settled heart unmoved is called Chan. Spirit penetrating ten thousand transformations is called numinosity. Wisdom pervading ten thousand affairs is called wisdom. Dao and primordial qi merging is called cultivation. True qi returning to the origin is called refinement. Dragon and tiger uniting is called the elixir. The three elixirs in harmony—this is called completion. Those with aspiration for the Dao, knowing this root source and cultivating according to the method, may naturally enter the great path of longevity.

*The Womb-Breathing Formula* by Xu Qiyan:
All who cultivate the Dao should constantly practice inner contemplation, casting off the Three Corpses, expelling the Six Bandits, drawing qi into the cinnabar field, and settling the heart in the ocean of awakening. When the heart is settled, the spirit is at peace; when the spirit is settled, the qi abides; when the qi abides, the embryo grows. The embryo’s growth depends on the breath’s abiding. Without breath, there is no embryo; without an embryo, there is no breath. When the breath abides, the embryo grows—this is the sacred mother and divine child. Thus it is said: When womb-breathing is settled, metal and wood unite; when the heart’s intent is at peace, dragon and tiger meet.

*The Womb-Breathing Formula* by Wang Fangping:
In all cultivation, first settle the heart and qi. When heart and qi are settled, the spirit congeals; when the spirit congeals, the heart is at ease; when the heart is at ease, the qi ascends; when the qi ascends, the environment is forgotten; when the environment is forgotten, there is clarity and stillness; when there is clarity and stillness, there is nothingness; when there is nothingness, life is preserved; when life is preserved, the Dao arises; when the Dao arises, all forms vanish; when all forms vanish, awareness is luminous; when awareness is luminous, there is spiritual penetration. The sutra says: When the heart is open, all dharmas are open; when the heart is still, all methods vanish. This is the true samadhi of the Tathagata. If scholars can truly settle the heart and qi, congeal the embryo and breath, then the returned elixir is not far, and the golden liquid is not distant.

*The Womb-Breathing Formula* by Master Red Pine:
Within the qi cavity, the ancients called it the gate of life and the door of death, or the root of Heaven and Earth. Concentrating the spirit here, over time, the primordial qi daily flourishes, and the primordial spirit daily grows strong. When the spirit is strong, the qi flows smoothly; when the qi flows smoothly, the blood harmonizes; when the blood harmonizes, the bones strengthen; when the bones strengthen, the marrow fills; when the marrow fills, the abdomen is full; when the abdomen is full, the lower body is firm; when the lower body is firm, walking is light and effortless, movement is tireless, the limbs are healthy, and the complexion is like a peach—immortality is not far.

*The Womb-Breathing Formula* by Master Emptiness of Nature:
My original nature is inherently perfect and luminous. This luminosity is the true womb of Heaven and Earth within my body. My original nature is inherently empty and still. This stillness is the true breath of the sun and moon within my body. Only when my body’s Heaven and Earth possess the true womb can the womb of Heaven and Earth merge with my womb to form my embryo. Only when my body’s sun and moon possess the true breath can the breath of the sun and moon merge with my breath to breathe my breath. Only when my original nature is empty and void can the emptiness of the Void merge with my emptiness to empty my emptiness.

*The Womb-Breathing Inscription* by Master Illusory Truth:
Thirty-six, with one swallow first. Exhale only gently, inhale only softly. Whether sitting or lying down, the same applies; walking or standing, remain composed. Avoid clamor and shun foul odors. Though called womb-breathing, it is truly the inner elixir. Not only does it cure illness, but it certainly extends life. Practice it long, and one’s name will be listed among the immortals.

The above oral instructions present the general outline; the rest are recorded in the alchemical classics and cannot be exhaustively described. This hibernation-like practice has great utility. It is said that one’s primordial spirit, hidden within the qi cavity, is like the myriad things concealed within the earth.

When the spirit enters, the qi of the Central Heaven descends to meet the qi of Earth, where it unites with the spirit—just as the Way of Earth receives from Heaven. The *Cantong Qi* states: "Ever follow the patterns of Earth, receiving from Heaven and spreading its decree." The *Book of Changes* says: "How perfect! The myriad things rely upon it for life." This occurs in the tenth month, when pure *kun* governs, when grasses and trees return to their roots, hibernating creatures retreat into their burrows, and all seals itself in winter’s closure. Though winter is the season of storage, the work of next year’s growth is already conceived within it. For the single yang does not arise at *fu* but at *kun*; though *kun* is utmost yin, within yin lies hidden yang, and the great medicine’s birth truly takes root here.

When the medicine is about to emerge, it resembles a pregnant woman carrying a child: she guards the true seed with care, never indulging. She is cautious in her movements, moderates her diet, avoids wine and lust, and refrains from anger. Externally, she does not exhaust her body; internally, she does not strain her mind. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, each has its proper method: when walking, place your feet on level ground; when standing, concentrate your spirit in the Great Void; when sitting, regulate the breath of the cinnabar field; when lying down, embrace the pearl below the navel. Thus it is said: in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, never depart from this.

The *Sleeping Zen Diagram*, *Walking Zen Diagram*, *Standing Zen Diagram*, and *Sitting Zen Diagram*—sitting need not be cross-legged; one should sit as usual. Though the posture may resemble that of ordinary people, by upholding the heart-method of the Confucian school, one differs from them. The so-called heart-method of the Confucian school means simply to keep the mind in the true place.

The orifices of the ears and eyes are the gates of the body; the square inch of the heart is the hall of the body; the cavity of life’s establishment is the chamber of the body. Thus, when the common person’s mind dwells in the square inch, it is like a person in the hall—sounds and sights can enter through the gates and disturb what lies within. But when the perfected person’s mind is concealed in the cavity of life’s establishment, it is like a person in the chamber—sounds and sights have no way to enter and peer within. Therefore, those who skillfully tend the mind withdraw into the chamber to nurture obscurity, and the ears and eyes become empty; they govern from the hall to attend to affairs, and the ears and eyes become functional.

If, while sitting, one does not uphold the Confucian heart-method, it is merely sitting in distraction—it is a mind let loose. The *Platform Sutra* says: "When thoughts do not arise, this is called sitting; when the self-nature does not move, this is called seated meditation." The subtlety of meditation truly lies in nothing beyond this.

The ancients said: "Cultivating the Dao is easy; refining the demons is difficult." How true these words are! While the demons of lust and gluttony are easy to subdue, the demon of sleep is hard to refine. Thus, the Chan school has the method of "long sitting without lying down." For one’s true essence is often lost at night; if sleep is not guarded, essence leaks downward, qi escapes upward, and the primordial spirit, having no support, abandons the body and departs. The Three Treasures scatter, and how can the body endure?

When the perfected person sleeps, they gather the spirit and conceal it in the cinnabar cave, where it unites with qi. Water and fire restrain each other, so the spirit does not stray outward, and qi naturally settles. Speaking of ordinary people: the spirit resides in the eyes, but when sleep deepens, it is stored in the kidneys. Upon waking at dawn, does not the spirit in the eyes become clear and bright? If night did not exist, how could the kidney-spirit be clear? Now, speaking of the Way of Heaven: the sun is attached to the sky by day, but at night it sinks into the earth and is concealed in the sea. At the break of dawn, does not the qi of Heaven become clear? If night did not exist, how could the sea’s qi be clear? This is what Master Cui’s *Entering the Medicine Mirror* means by "water and fire in harmony, never aging."

Now, ordinary people sleep in ignorance and awaken suddenly—what is it that governs them and makes them conscious? When the *hun* and spirit unite, there is awareness; when the *po* and corpse combine, there is stupor. Stupor is the root of death; awareness is the sign of life. The *hun* belongs to yang and delights in clarity and emptiness; the *po* belongs to yin and loves to gallop. The *po* is the ghost; the *hun* is the spirit. By day, the spirit engages with things; by night, it takes form in dreams. Before the millet is cooked or the southern branch awakened, a lifetime’s glory and disgrace, wealth and honor, a hundred years’ sorrows and joys—all are experienced within a single dream. If the spirit departs and does not return, if it wanders and does not come back, the path between life and death is severed, and the road to the netherworld is cut off.

From this perspective, a person cannot give life to themselves—what gives them life is the person within the dream. They cannot bring about their own death—what brings about death is the person within the dream. Yet if one does not know why they dream, they also do not know why they die; if one does not know why they awaken, they also do not know why they live. Within the dream, there is awakening because true awakening exists within the dream; within death, there is life because eternal life exists within death. Therefore, through awakening one knows life; through dreaming one knows death. Knowing these two, one can enter the Dao.

When a person is awake, is there anything their ears cannot hear, their eyes cannot see, their hands cannot grasp, their feet cannot walk, their heart cannot feel joy or anger? Yet when a person sleeps, their ears are still there—why can they not hear? Their eyes are still there—why can they not see? Their hands are still there—why can they not grasp? Their feet are still there—why can they not walk? Their heart is still there—why can they feel neither joy nor anger? From this, it seems that in death, one is without knowledge or awareness. Yet when a person dreams, even in sleep, their ears can hear—why is this hearing not connected to their own ears?

There are also eyes that can see in dreams—yet why is this seeing not bound to one’s own eyes? There are also hands that can grasp—yet why is this grasping not bound to one’s own hands? There are also feet that can walk—yet why is this walking not bound to one’s own feet? There is also a heart that can feel joy and anger—yet why are this joy and anger not bound to one’s own heart? From this, it seems that in death, one may yet possess knowledge and awareness.

Yet do life and death truly share the same principle as day and night, dreaming and waking? The true person of old, when awake, knew no sorrow; when asleep, dreamed no dreams. Thus, the state of dreamless sleep cannot be attained until one has mastered the Dao.

For beginners, however, whose minds remain unpurified, dullness prevails over clarity. The moment they close their eyes, the primordial spirit departs the body, and the sleep demon takes residence, causing the hun-soul and po-soul to scatter in all directions. Not only does the spirit wander and qi disperse, but one risks the calamity of a cracked crucible or shattered cauldron. To counter this sleep demon, one must employ the *Five Dragons Coiling the Body* method.

The oral instruction states: Lie with the head to the east, the body curled on its side, like a coiled dragon or a curled dog. One arm bends to pillow the head, while the other stretches to stroke the navel and abdomen. One leg extends, the other retracts. Calm the mind before closing the eyes; attain utmost emptiness and abide in profound stillness. Naturally, spirit and qi return to their root, breath nurtures itself, and though one does not regulate the breath, the breath regulates itself; though one does not subdue the qi, the qi subdues itself. Those who cultivate thus bring blessing to seven generations of ancestors. Chen Tzu-hsien left his form on Mount Hua, and Chiang Ch’ing-hsia shed his husk in the Wang-wu Mountains. This is the essence of *sleeping meditation*, distinct from the methods of *guiding and pulling*.

With sufficient practice, one naturally holds spirit and sleep in embrace, awakens to the moment of life and death, and distances oneself from delusive dreams. This aligns with what Master Ch’i-yüan called: “The true person of old, when awake, knew no sorrow; when asleep, dreamed no dreams.” Yet even in deep sleep, one must remain vigilant; upon waking, turn slowly. At this moment, the mind is serene, innate knowledge abides freely—like the realm of the Buddha.

As Po Chü-yi said:
*Where past and future cease,*
*Before a single thought arises—*
*If one expands this moment,*
*Stillness yields its effect.*
Truly, it is beyond description.

In the quiet chamber of Master Yin, a couplet read:
*When awakened, guard against idle thoughts—*
*The heart becomes empty and bright.*
*Amidst turmoil, remain as in ordinary times—*
*Matters naturally proceed smoothly.*

Master Li’s *Man Chiang Hung* lyric states:
*A fine tradition of sleep,*
*Another realm of sleep’s samādhi.*
*In sleep, the heart remains sincere;*
*In slumber, the mind stays clear.*
*Once the method’s intent is grasped,*
*One regulates spirit and qi within sleep.*
*This sleep-work—*
*Who understands its subtle art?*
*It dispels sleep, calms meditation.*

Another poem on resisting demons reads:
*How to endure drowsiness in sitting?*
*Ghostly faces and demon heads appear!*
*Dullness and distraction arise from turbid qi,*
*Unbroken thoughts belong to excess yin.*
*Gradually, like water breaching a dyke,*
*Or waves subsiding in a windless river.*
*When nature is still and emotions empty, the heart unmoved,*
*There is no dullness in sitting, no demons in sleep.*

The ancients had breath but no sleep. Thus it is said: “At dusk, retire to rest, breathing as if in a single awakening.” When deeply asleep, yang light is entirely submerged by yin turbidity—like a corpse. If one knows the method of *evening rest*, at dusk, the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, the mouth speaks nothing, the heart bears no burdens, the nose breathes without panting, the four limbs remain still. That single point of primordial spirit and true qi cling to each other, like a seed of fire in a furnace. With long practice, the spirit becomes full and sleep unnecessary, the qi becomes full and hunger forgotten, the essence becomes full and desire vanishes. Primordial qi gathers of itself, true essence congeals of itself, the fetal embryo nests of itself. The Three Corpses perish, the Nine Worms depart—where then does the sleep demon go?

The body naturally feels peaceful and light, the mind naturally empty and alert, the qi naturally harmonious and clear, the spirit naturally round and luminous. Thus one enters the path of longevity—why ask whether the Dao is perfected or not?

**Purple Center Daoist’s Answers to Questions**

A guest asked: *What of the practice of seated meditation?*

I answered: Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are practices where one works with medicinal substances, enabling seated transformation to arise within the crucible. Without the true seed, it is like boiling an empty cauldron with hot fire. As the Buddhists say: *This is the work of corpse-guarding demons, using bricks as mirrors.* Their words may seem correct, yet they are not entirely wrong. From Bo Yang of the Jin and Zi Yang of the Song, whose voices rose above all in this Dao, to those who later inherited their legacy—Hai Qiong, Zi Qiong, Huang Fang, Yuan Du, Shang Yang, and the various Perfected Ones—each carried forward the thread of golden elixir’s lineage. To this day, its single strand remains unbroken, with generations never lacking those who transmit and uphold the unified source of the Three Teachings. As for mere stillness and rigid sitting, these are but the lowest practices of the lesser vehicle, the deviant paths by which heretics mislead others.

The guest asked again: *Then what, after all, is the proper way?*
I said: If you are willing to make great offerings of dharma-wealth and vow before Heaven, I shall tell you.
The guest knelt and entreated: *This disciple has searched for eons without encounter, and now in this life has met with your guidance. Your compassion is boundless—there is no greater kindness.*
I said: Come, and I will tell you. If you now pledge your faith earnestly, I will speak recklessly—do not listen recklessly. If I speak truthfully, do not believe recklessly. Let me tell you thus.

The Three Treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—sustain the cosmos and encompass yin and yang. Heaven and Earth possess them to embrace the qian and kun; the human heart possesses them to cultivate immortality and attain Buddhahood. Yet there is an inner and an outer: those who understand may cultivate both, while those who do not understand cultivate only one. Those who cultivate only one are benighted fools; those who cultivate both may realize the fruit of immortality and Buddhahood. But because the lineage has been disordered, even to speak thus far is to cause most to gaze in bewilderment and retreat.

If you truly have no doubt, I shall tell you. Those who speak of cultivating both inner and outer say that essence resides in the dim and indistinct. This essence bears the surname Jin, is called the Third Son of Nine, has the personal name Yuanjing, and the style Jinhua Shangfujun. It dwells west of the Jade Pool, rides a tiger when it comes and goes, and in infancy is called the Infant, while in later years is known as the Golden Elder. When it visits a neighbor’s home, it is called the Master, and its nature delights in the fruit of the *jiaoli* tree.

This is the essence that preceded Heaven and Earth, and it is the supreme treasure of humanity. Qi arises from the midst of emptiness and nothingness. This qi bears the surname Bai, is called the First Son of Taiyi, has the personal name Yuanqi, and the style Lord of the Cosmos, the Unadorned Silk Gentleman. It resides in the Western Riverlands, rides a white tiger when it comes and goes, and in infancy is called the True Seed, while in later years is known as the White-Haired Elder. When it visits a neighbor’s home, it is called Father and Mother, delights in eating black turtles, and is full of affection. This is the true qi that preceded Heaven and Earth, and it is the supreme treasure of humanity.

Thus Shangyangzi said: “Though it comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness, it is not bestowed by Heaven, nor produced by Earth, nor is it anything possessed by the body—it is neither essence nor blood, neither plant nor metal nor stone. All these it is not. Who, then, can know it?”

Now, speaking of the spirit that preceded Heaven and Earth: this spirit is titled the Positionless True Person, and the Buddha calls it *hṛdaya*. If the Buddha recognizes this spirit, it has wondrous use. This spirit governs both the killing and the giving of life. Those who cultivate immortality and attain Buddhahood must have this spirit as their master before they may succeed.

Thus the *Inner Classic* says: “Within the human body there are two essences: one is the hun, the other the po.” That which follows essence in its coming and going is the spirit. As the White Patriarch said: “Among the nine palaces of the human head, the central one is called the Valley Spirit. The spirit constantly dwells in this valley, by day engaging with things, by night engaging with dreams, yet the spirit cannot settle in its abode. Before the southern branch is severed, before the millet is cooked, a lifetime of glory and disgrace, wealth and honor, a hundred years of sorrow and joy—all are experienced in the space of a single dream. If it wanders and does not return, departs and does not come back, then the path to the netherworld is cut off, and the road between life and death is severed.”

From this we see that humans cannot give life to themselves—it is the spirit that gives them life; humans cannot die by themselves—it is the spirit that causes their death. If the spirit were to dwell long in its valley, how could a person die?

Ziyang said: “To refine the spirit, refine the spirit that is no-spirit.” This is what he meant.

Tianyingzi said: “Though one may have long practiced stabilizing the body, if the heart lacks the five periods and seven stages, the foul vessel of a shortened lifespan will decay and return to emptiness. To claim afterward that wisdom has awakened and the Dao has been accomplished is truly a loss.” This may be called mistaken.

As for those who speak of seated meditation, I find their words distasteful. The worth of the sages and immortals of highest antiquity lies in their cultivation among humankind. If this is not so, I beg you not to speak of it—it is not yet time to awaken. Thus concludes the fourth oral instruction on the dual cultivation of nature and life from *The Pointers of the Myriad Spirits*.

“The Celestial and Human Conjoin to Gather the Medicine and Return It to the Crucible” (Illustration of Gathering the Medicine and Returning It to the Crucible) (Including the two oral instructions: Closing the *Ren* and Opening the *Du*, and Gathering Fire to Bear the Metal)

I have heard my teacher say: Humans receive the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth at birth and possess the true seed, which can generate endlessly and attain neither birth nor extinction. Yet people cannot preserve it, and it dissipates day by day until they perish. Even those who know to preserve it, if they do not understand the method of refining with fire, will not achieve firmness and will easily be seized by the transformations of creation. If one can preserve it without loss and further refine it with fire until it congeals into the elixir—hard as gold, pure as jade—then one may attain longevity and escape dissolution.

To refine this elixir, though medicinal substances are primary, to gather them one must work at the root. What is the root? The Great Ultimate within one’s body. Heaven and Earth take the undifferentiated chaos as their Great Ultimate; our bodies take the profound and obscure as their Great Ultimate. Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things through the union of *yin* and *yang*; our bodies generate the great medicine through the union of *yin* and *yang*. The arising of the great medicine within the body is no different from the generation of things by Heaven and Earth—it is simply the two *qi* of *yin* and *yang*. The two bestow and transform, and the mysterious and the yellow intermingle; one endows and one receives, and above and below connect, merging into one. Thus it is called “chaos.” Chaos is the obscure and profound enclosure of Heaven and Earth, and it is also the womb of the great medicine.

The *Nanhua Sutra* states: “The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure.” The *Daodejing* states: “Profound and obscure, within it lies essence. This essence is most true.” Only this true essence is the true seed within our bodies. Because it enters into chaos, it is called the Great Ultimate; because it is the beginning of creation within the body, it is called the Prior Heaven; because *yin* and *yang* are not yet divided, it is called the One *Qi*. It is also called the Yellow Sprout, the Mysterious Pearl.

Also called True Lead; also called Yang Essence. When this essence congeals between Heaven and Earth, it may become gold or stone, enduring for a thousand or ten thousand years without decay. If one can turn inward to seek it, causing the Yang Essence within oneself to congeal into treasure, then it becomes as enduring as the gold and stone of Heaven and Earth—how could mere substances compare?

Yet this Yang Essence is not easily obtained. For throughout the human body, from top to bottom, all that has form is nothing but the dregs and impurities of *yin* and evil. Thus Master Fang of the Chamber said: “The four great elements of the body all belong to *yin*; what thing is Yang Essence?” Yuan of the Supervising Meridian said: “A single speck of Yang Essence is hidden within the mountain of form, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the mysterious pass of the One Aperture.” Zhao Zhongyi said: “Within the body, inside and out, all is *yin*; do not seek Yang Essence within.” Qiu Changchun said: “Though it is obtained within the chamber of *yang*, it is not the art of controlling women. It is neither the body born of father and mother nor the treasure produced by mountains and forests. To grope for it upon the form is all wrong, yet one cannot seek it outside the form either.” Such words are no different from scooping the moon from water or plucking flowers from a mirror—truly, wisdom surpasses that of Yan and Min, and it is difficult to force conjecture. Thus the patriarchs rarely spoke of it, and the world rarely knows it. This is not only the case today; even the ancients had words that were hard to fathom.

For example, the True Man of the Jade Tripod said:
*“The Five Agents and Four Images—Kan and Li—*
*I’ve clearly explained in verse for thee.*
*Where the medicine arises, where the work begins,*
*How many grasp it? How many know?”*

The True Man of Purple Yang said:
*“This matter is rare in the world;*
*How could it be known by ordinary men?”*

The True Man of Apricot Grove said:
*“Where spirit and qi return to the root,*
*When body and mind restore the mandate—*
*These true apertures,*
*Few indeed know them.”*

The True Man Boyang said: “One reason is to conceal it from the world, so none may know.” What is this “one”? It is that which is within the unmanifest, the non-dual One—namely, the Prior Heaven One *Qi* mentioned earlier.

The *Cui Xu Pian* states:
*“The great medicine must rely on spirit, qi, and essence;*
*Gathered together, they unite and form.*
*The elixir head is but the Prior Heaven qi;*
*Refined into the Yellow Sprout, it blooms as jade flowers.”*

The *Fuming Pian* states:
*“Gather the qi of the Two Modes before their division,*
*Seize the essence of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union.*
*Flash into the Yellow Chamber,*
*Tempered into the supreme treasure.”*

The *Chong Zheng Pian* states:
*“In the icy abyss ten thousand fathoms deep, the sleeping Black Dragon*
*Guards beneath its chin a pearl, radiant and red.*
*Only with utmost care and no disturbance may it be gathered;*
*Then, according to the time and day, apply the divine method.”*

For “gathering” means to gather without gathering, and “taking” means to take without taking—it lies in the stillness and stability where no action can be done. Long ago, the Yellow Emperor lost his Mysterious Pearl and sent Knowledge to seek it, sent Separation to seek it, sent Abuse to seek it, but none could find it. Only when he sent Vast Image was it obtained. Vast Image means to forget the form. Only by forgetting the form and becoming vast as an image can the Prior Heaven One *Qi* be attained.

The *Jilang Ji*’s “Ode to the Prior Heaven” says:
*“A piece of Prior Heaven is called the Great Void;*
*When nothing is done, the true richness appears.”*
It also says:
*“If you ask what Prior Heaven is—a single word: nothing.*
*Only then does Later Heaven require effort.”*

What is Prior Heaven? It is the state of absolute stillness, profound and obscure, the time before the Great Ultimate divided. What is Later Heaven? It is the state of response and communication, vague and indistinct, the time after the Great Ultimate divided.

The *Hunyuan Baozhang* states:
*“Still and unmoving, it responds and communicates;*
*One glimpses the workings of *yin* and *yang* in creation.*
*Truly, when still and unmoving,*
*The heart connects with Heaven, and the workings of creation may be seized.”*

The *Cui Xu Pian* states:
*“Do not seek creation in the kidneys;*
*Trouble not the heart to find Prior Heaven.”*

When joy and anger have not yet arisen, in the place beyond seeing and hearing, rivers and seas are silent, mountains and peaks conceal their mist, sun and moon pause their light, the celestial sphere halts its turning, the eight vessels return to the source, and breath is utterly stilled—then, deeply entering the profound obscurity, one no longer knows Heaven as a canopy, Earth as a chariot, nor that the world has people or that oneself has a body. After a while, the three palaces fill with *qi*, the mechanism stirs with a rustling sound—then, with one sword-stroke, the chaos is split open, and with two hands, the primal vastness is torn apart. This is called “generating being from non-being.”

Ning Xuzi’s poem says:
*“Not in worldly toil, not in the mountains,*
*One must seek directly the utmost end of the profound obscurity.”*
What is the “utmost end of the profound obscurity”? It is the time of extreme emptiness and profound stillness. The heart without things is empty; thoughts not arising are still. Attain emptiness to its utmost, guard stillness to its profoundest—then *yin* and *yang* naturally unite. When *yin* and *yang* unite, Yang Essence is produced.

Thus Chen Tunan said: “Preserve the Yang Essence, and the immortal appears fully formed.” For the tip of *yang* arises daily, but ordinary people do not know how to gather and concentrate it, allowing it to disperse and become the *qi* of the entire body. The perfected one, using the method, pursues and gathers it, condensing it into a pearl the size of a millet grain. The Buddhists call it *bodhi*; the Daoists name it the True Seed. Those who cultivate nature but do not recognize this *bodhi* seed are what the *Yuanjue Jing* calls “externalists of inherent nature.” Those who cultivate life but do not recognize this True Seed are what the *Yuhua Jing* calls “those who sit in vain in side doors.”

Zhang Ziyang said: “The Great Dao is easy or difficult to cultivate depending on whether one knows the way—it depends on oneself, and it depends on Heaven. If one does not know when the medicine arises, does not know how to gather and take it, does not know the work of refining, one sees only difficulty, not ease. But if one truly knows the time when the medicine arises, the oral instructions for gathering and taking, and the work of refining, one sees only ease, not difficulty. These two depend on whether one meets a teacher or not.”

Thus it is said: the fullness of the moon depends on oral instructions, while the marvel of the *zi* hour lies in heart-to-heart transmission. Yet the *zi* hour has two interpretations—there is the living *zi* hour, and there is the proper *zi* hour. Formerly, Master Yin said: "To seek the Great Medicine as the foundation of the elixir, one must recognize the living *zi* hour within the body." Another verse states:

> Through reading the *Preface to the Golden Elixir*,
> I came to know the mysterious *Xuanguan* cavity.
> Through reading the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*,
> I learned only that intent arrives where it will.
>
> The Great Dao has yin and yang,
> Yin and yang follow movement and stillness.
> In stillness, one enters the profound and obscure;
> In movement, there arises a state of vagueness and indistinctness.
>
> True earth divides into *wu* and *ji*,
> *Wu* and *ji* do not occur simultaneously.
> When *ji* arrives, it is but natural;
> When *wu* arrives, there is deliberate action.
>
> Refine the lead within *kan*,
> Pair it with the mercury within *li*.
> Lead and mercury congeal into cinnabar,
> And body and mind then enter samādhi.

Terms like "movement and stillness," "profound and obscure," and "true earth" all serve to elucidate the oral instructions for the living *zi* hour.

What is meant by "movement and stillness"? It is the time when, in utter quiescence, one returns to the root and restores the stillness of *kun*—this is when I wait in stillness. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, when yang qi subtly germinates and returns—this is when I respond in movement. If, when movement is called for, one interposes stillness, or when stillness is called for, one introduces movement; if one forces growth prematurely or forgets and loses the moment afterward—then this is no longer the constant principle of movement and stillness.

The perfected ones of antiquity, in their movement, followed the course of Heaven; in their stillness, they were as deep and silent as an abyss. When movement was due, they moved; when stillness was due, they were still—this was their constant method. Today’s scholars, unaware that the alchemical method has its own constant principles of movement and stillness, either cling exclusively to movement or exclusively to stillness. What they call "movement" is merely the movement of circulating qi; what they call "stillness" is merely the stillness of dhyāna. Both are mistaken.

Does not the *Zhixuan Pian* say:
> Every person’s qi and blood naturally flow,
> Nourishing and defending, yin and yang circulate through the hundred moments.
> How could it lie in shutting the door to practice circulating qi?
> It would be like placing a head upon a head.

When did it ever take circulating qi as movement? Does not the *Cuixu Pian* say:
> Only this true operation of Heaven and Earth,
> No need to sit rigidly in wordless silence.
> With no thought and no mind, the head grows dull—
> How could one gather and form the immortal embryo?

When did it ever take dhyāna as stillness?

When a person’s movement reaches its extreme, they naturally enter the state of profound obscurity. This profound obscurity is the time of sleep, when one enters a realm without Heaven, without Earth, without self, without others—yet it does not involve dreaming. If one enters the realm of dreams, then there arise joy and anger, fear and terror, afflictions, sorrows and joys, loves and desires, no different from daytime. Moreover, this is entirely unlike the scene of profound obscurity, where there is no Heaven, no Earth, no others, no self. Such a state—dim and obscure—only appears when, during the day, movement reaches its extreme and one longs for stillness. If one sleeps deeply at night, dreams must arise. How could this state occur then?

During the day, moments of profound obscurity often arise, but people, distracted by the tumult of thoughts and desires, rarely attain this state. As Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: "Within a single day, in the twelve hours, wherever intent arrives, all may serve." Within a single day, intent may arrive more than once, and the medicine may arise more than once. This is what Zhang Pingshu meant by "one grain after another, from the subtle to the manifest."

Generally, the medicine must be sought with true intent, hence it is said: "Diligently seek true lead with intent," and again: "Constantly seek with intent in the Flowery Pond." For the true intent within the human body is what is called true earth. The arising of true earth has its time—it does not depend on sensory stimulation but arises naturally. Even amidst the clamor of a bustling marketplace, it cannot be suppressed, hence it is called true earth.

There are two kinds of earth: *wu* and *ji*. Since earth has two aspects, intent must also have two—namely, one yang and one yin. What is called "true" is that which is not the slightest bit forced or false. If there is even a trace of force or falsity, it is the product of deliberate calculation and planning, belonging to the realm of the illusory and unreal—it is not true intent. Only with this true intent does true lead arise.

What does it mean to say "with this true intent, true lead arises"? When movement reaches its extreme and stillness ensues, the moment true intent arrives, one enters profound obscurity. This intent belongs to yin and is called *ji* earth. When yin and yang unite, precisely at the moment when one yang line stirs, one suddenly feels the blossoming of the heart-mind, a warm qi surging and harmonizing. As yin and yang meet in their yearly cycle, true essence naturally arises—this true essence is true lead, the so-called "lead from the watery region," which is but a single flavor.

When yin and yang unite, on the verge of separation yet not yet separated, in a state of vagueness and indistinctness—this is when stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises. This intent belongs to yang and is called *wu* earth. At this time, true lead subtly appears, the sprouts of the medicine newly tender. This is the moment when there is both substance and image, akin to the faintest glimmer at dawn. One must swiftly stir the gate and mechanism, urgently apply effort to gather and take it, so that the true essence born of profound obscurity does not escape.

The so-called work of gathering and taking is none other than the "Form-Resolving Formula" of Patriarch Bodhidharma and the "Initial Vehicle Formula" of Patriarch Haichan. The two formulas are largely the same, consisting of nothing beyond the four words: *absorb, lick, contract, close*.

As Patriarch Chunyang said:
> Dim and obscure, it arises in vagueness;
> Vague and indistinct, it congeals into a mass.

This is precisely that formula. Though it is a method of deliberate action, without true earth, how could one apply effort? Thus, it is not the gathering of lead. It is because true earth arises that true lead is captured, hence it is said: "True earth seizes true lead." When lead ascends and pairs with mercury, mercury, having obtained lead, naturally does not fly away, hence it is said: "True lead restrains true mercury." Since lead and mercury are none other than true earth, body and mind naturally become utterly quiescent and unmoving, and the Great Medicine of the golden elixir is congealed.

Thus, within a single hour, there is the mechanism of the return of the solitary yang.

This mechanism does not lie in the winter solstice, nor in the dawn of the new moon, nor even in the midnight hour. None but those who profoundly grasp the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth and comprehend the transformations within the body can fathom the living *zi* hour in all its secrecy.

Though it is said that within a single day of twelve hours, any moment of union may serve, why do the ancient immortals invariably choose the time when the solitary yang first stirs at midnight? At that hour, the Great Yang resides precisely in the north, and the qi within the human body reaches the *weilü* pass—thus aligning with Heaven and Earth. Only then can one steal the mechanism of Heaven and Earth, seize the marvel of yin and yang, refine hun and po into one, and unite nature and life in dual cultivation. For this is the moment between *kun* and *fu*, when Heaven and Earth first open, when the sun and moon conjoin, when grasses and trees begin to sprout, when the yin and yang within the human body meet, and when the immortals gather the medicine. Inner truth and outer resonance then harmonize like tallying tokens—this is the moment when Heaven and humanity unite in inception, most wondrous, most wondrous indeed.

Chen Niuwan said:
*"Whenever Heaven and Earth unite in congress,
Steal the mechanism of yin and yang’s transformation."*

*The Scripture of Uniting with the Dao* states:
*"Feast upon its season, and the hundred bones are buried;
Steal its mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace."*

What, then, is this mechanism? It is the *tian’gen* at the extreme of principle, the moment when the old year ends and the new begins, when the sun first rises. This juncture is easily attained, yet its meaning is difficult to express in words. One who grasps this intent—what could they fail to understand?

This juncture is precisely the wondrous locus of the true mechanism of transformation. The *Zhouyi* exhausts the marvel of the true mechanism; the *Fu* hexagram exhausts the marvel of the *Zhouyi*; and the first line of *Fu* exhausts the marvel of the *Fu* hexagram. Thus it is said: *"Fu* reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth." For at this moment, Heaven and Earth experience the return of the solitary yang, and the Heaven and Earth within our own bodies do likewise. Internally, we gather the yang within ourselves; externally, we steal the yang of Heaven and Earth. Could the yang of Heaven and Earth then fail to return entirely to our bodies as our medicine? Yet though Heaven and Earth are vast and their transformations wondrous, they cannot transcend this moment of inception—this is the natural principle of mutual resonance.

If one knows this moment when Heaven and humanity unite in inception, one may sit in stillness at midnight, concentrate the spirit and gather the qi, withdraw the gaze and return the hearing, seal the *dui* gate, fortify the numinous root, generate no thought, and instantly still the myriad conditions. Vast and indistinct, like the undivided Great Ultimate; dark and profound, like the unmanifested Two Modes.

Profound indeed! Alone it abides, like the moon’s reflection in a limpid pool—still and unmoving; like still water without a ripple, inwardly unaware of one’s own body, outwardly oblivious to the cosmos. At the final hour of *hai* and the inception of *zi*, when the yang qi of Heaven and Earth arrives, swiftly gather it; if it has not yet come, empty yourself and await it—never dare to precede it.

Qu Yuan’s *Far Roaming* says:
*The Dao may be received, yet cannot be transmitted.
Its smallness has no exterior; its greatness no bounds.
Unsullied and numinous, it will arise of itself.
A single qi, supremely spirit-like—preserve it at midnight.
Empty yourself to await it; do not act before it.*

Xu Jingsun’s *Three Medicines Song* says: *"Store the heart, sever thoughts, and await the crystallizing moment."*
The *Pointing to the Mystery* says: *"Seal the dui gate, lower the lids, and silently observe."*
All speak of concealing the vessel to await the hour.

Ah! When the time arrives, no labor of the heart is needed—internally, the exchange occurs of itself, and the coagulation forms. The eight chambers must be aligned with the hour, and the sun’s chariot will ascend of its own accord. How could one dare to precede it?

The great medicine of the Golden Elixir is conceived in the prior Heaven and born in the posterior Heaven; its marvel lies in the moment when the Great Ultimate is about to divide yet remains undivided—stillness at its utmost, not yet giving way to movement; yang about to return, yet not yet parted from yin. At this time, dim and obscure, like mountain mist veiling the peaks; hazy and indistinct, like fog enveloping the waters; drifting and fine, like winter snow gradually congealing and gathering; deep and heavy, like fermented water slowly settling and clarifying. In an instant, an itch arises in the finest pores, the limbs grow soft as silk, the heart feels hazy and indistinct, and the yang organ stirs and rises. At this moment, the yang qi connects with Heaven; when the signal arrives, the jade bell is struck once, the twin caves of the Jade Grotto open, the time is ripe and the qi transforms, the medicine is born and the spirit knows. The earthly thunder rumbles, the *xun* gate opens, and the dragon leaps forth from the eastern pool. This is the moment when the Mysterious Pass is revealed and the refined gold emerges from the ore.

Shao Kangjie says:
*In the midst of the hazy, yin and yang first transform;
Thrice the heavens and earth swirl in mist.
Amidst this, a fleeting wondrous scene—
How could mere effort capture it in words?*

Bai Yuchan says:
*Gazing at the Dipper’s handle circling the heavens,
I suddenly grasped the immortal’s wondrous secret.
A single speck of true yang arises in the Kan position,
Mending the deficiency in the Li palace.
Since ancient times, immortals have ceaselessly worked this exchange of Kan and Li.
This year at Winter Solstice, the plum blossoms still congeal in snow.
The ancient sages on this day sealed their gates, refusing all comings and goings—
All for the sake of the multitudes of living beings.
All things contain the intent of generation and nurturance,
Precisely at the inception of *zi* and the final hour of *hai*.
The Creator moves without sound; fire arises within water—
The marvel lies in the *Xu-Wei* Cavern.
Now that this is understood, the golden crow flies into the toad’s grotto.*

The so-called *Xu-Wei* Cavern is none other than the Earth Gate, the forbidden portal. This cavity lies between the *Ren* and *Du* meridians, ascending to the Celestial Valley and descending to the Bubbling Spring. Thus the ancient sages said: *"The Celestial Gate must open; the Earth Gate must forever remain sealed."* For the gathering and dispersal of essence and qi always occur here; the arising of water and fire begins here; the transformation of yin and yang transpires here; the entry of being and non-being happens here; the separation of mother and child takes place here.

The *Emerald Writ* says:
*There is a path where mother and child part,
Its marvel lies between the Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, and Girl.*

This cavity is of the utmost significance, the very threshold of human life and death—hence the immortals call it the Cave of Life and Death.

The *Triplex Unity* says: *"To fortify the numinous root is this; to restrain and seal the forbidden gate is this."*
The *Yellow Court Classic* says: *"Seal the Gate of Life to protect the Jade Capital—this; close the path of essence to attain long life—this."*

When true yang first arises, its form is like raging fire, its appearance like a scorching wind. It breaks through barriers and forges paths, inevitably passing through this cavity. Yet because the seal is tight and impenetrable, it can only be driven back to the *Weilü*, where a hollow flame rises into the celestial thoroughfare, surging upward to strike the three barriers and pierce the Crown Gate, there to unite with true mercury and congeal into cinnabar. Whose achievement is this, if not the work of restraining and sealing the forbidden gate?

Nature’s quiescence—gold returns to its root,
Essence congeals—Kan departs to mend southern Li.
When these two numinous things merge,
Yin exhausted, yang pure, the Dao may be attained.

**Oral Formula from Li Daochun’s *Zhonghe Collection*:**
Fire is near, the medicine not far,
Heavenly water surges like the tide.
Know to gather the two—mercury and lead,
All desires vanish at once.
Lifting the myriad existences, the Three Origins unite,
Refining all yin, the Five Qi pay homage.
After ten months, the embryo sheds its form,
The infant’s visage yearns for the divine sky.

**Oral Formula of Chen Nan:**
Seize the wondrous celestial mechanism,
At midnight, observe the Dipper’s handle—
a drop of sacred dew.
Who stirs the rice-blossom’s head?
Gather it here.
Like a green lotus holding its pistil,
a drop pierces the Jade Pool, autumn’s myriad sounds.
The wind stirs,
a bright moon, a grain of sand.

All the above are the oral teachings of the perfected on obtaining the medicine, each varying in expression to aid verification.

**Method of Gathering Fire and Carrying Gold (Diagram of Gathering Fire and Carrying Gold)**

First, move the fire of the southern Li palace to refine the gold within the northern Kan’s water—this is "casting red into black," where spirit congeals into the Kun navel to generate the medicine.

Now, move the gold within the northern Kan’s water to restrain the wood within the southern Li’s fire—this is "black meeting red," where spirit congeals into the Qian crown to form the elixir.

Thus, *The Awakening to Reality* by Master Ziyang states:
*"Relying on Kun’s position, the body is formed,
Planted in Qian’s domain, the palace of union."*

Master Cui’s *Mirror for Entering the Medicine* says:
*"Born in Kun, planted in Qian."*
Qian above serves as the crucible,
Kun below as the furnace.

Without fierce smelting, the medicine cannot emerge from the furnace;
Without counterflow and reverse rotation, the medicine cannot ascend the crucible.

Lead is a substance of sinking heaviness—
without fire, how could it fly?
Mercury is a substance of soaring lightness—
without lead, how could it congeal?

Thus, the method of gathering fire is most crucial.

What is the method of gathering fire?
This method is the four-character oral formula of the two patriarchs, Bodhidharma and Haichan:
*Absorb, Lick, Gather, Close.*

*Absorb*: Draw qi through the nose to connect with prior Heaven.
*Lick*: Press the tongue to the upper palate to welcome sweet dew.
*Gather*: Tightly contract the perineum, inwardly lifting—
the bright moon’s radiance soars to the crown.
*Close*: Seal the mouth, lower the gaze, and reverse hearing—
over time, the spirit-water descends to the Yellow Court.

Hu Cuihu says:
*"Without closing below, fire does not gather and gold does not rise;
without closing above, the medicine does not congeal and the elixir does not form."*
Thus, the method of gathering fire is the first task in gathering, refining, and smelting.

In the dim and indistinct, it is the moment of gathering;
in fierce smelting, it is the work of gathering.
*Absorb, Lick, Gather, Close*—these are the essentials of refining.

The method of gathering values timing—
not too early, for the medicine will be tender and easily ascend;
not too late, for the medicine will age and solidify.
Only when lead’s blossom whitens and the Mysterious Pearl takes form
is it the proper time to gather.

Master Ziyang says:
*"When lead meets the arising of gui, swiftly gather;
when gold meets the full moon’s distance, it is unfit to taste."*

Master Sanfeng says:
*"Seek the true seed where lightning refines,
Find the root source when the wind’s signal arrives."*

Where lightning refines—
after the profound darkness, in the fleeting moment of indistinctness,
when the first yang line stirs,
the pearl falls into the Jade Pool.
At this moment, employ the *Seal of the Passes* from the *Cantong Qi*,
tightly sealing the Great Mystery,
closing the Ren and opening the Du.
Hastily fan with the bellows,
blow with the Xun wind,
forge with fierce fire.
Fire blazes, water boils,
water boils, the River Chariot stirs,
carrying gold upward.
The Niwan Palace unites with true mercury,
mercury, meeting descending lead, no longer flees.
Thus, gradually drawing and adding,
gradually congealing,
naturally lead diminishes day by day,
mercury increases day by day.
Over time, lead is exhausted, mercury dries of itself,
yin is exhausted, yang is pure of itself—
at this point, the great medicine of the golden elixir is complete.

To refine this great medicine, there is no other method—
only gathering the prior Heaven’s primordial qi,
making it the mother of the golden elixir.

The master’s teaching says:
*"Refine the ancestral qi of the Great Brahma,
Fly the golden essence of later times,
Preserve the wondrous image of the Imperial One,
Return the Three Primes to the Yellow Court."*

This is the oral instruction within oral instructions. Scholars merely know that the union of lead and mercury forms the elixir, yet they do not understand that gathering, drawing, refining, and firing each follow their own sequence and method. For gathering initiates the process, drawing and adding bring it to completion, and within this, regulation depends entirely on firing. Thus, Master Ziyang said:

*"Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the firing, all is in vain."*

Zhu Huweng said:

*"If immortals did not compose the* Cantong Qi*,*
*How could one know the firing’s subtlety?"*

Xue Daoguang said:

*"Sages transmit the medicine but not the fire,
For firing’s art has long been scarcely known.
Do not treat the great Dao as child’s play—
The immortal’s path demands careful reflection."*

The method of firing has both civil and martial aspects; it cannot be uniformly applied. When yang stirs within stillness, metal departs the ore’s earth, thunder rumbles below, and fire compels the gold—this is the firing of the fourth stage. *"Casually tending the furnace to watch the fire, simply settle the spirit and breath, letting nature take its course"*—this is the firing of the sixth stage. *"Neither losing civil yang nor martial yin, advancing and retreating, drawing and adding all under control"*—this is the firing of the fifth stage.

*"Preserving and maintaining one’s nature"*—this is the firing of the Confucian school. *"Subtle and continuous as if present"*—this is the firing of the Daoist school. *"Neither forcing nor neglecting"*—this is the firing of the Buddhist school. *"For three months without deviation"*—this is Yanzi’s firing. *"Thrice daily reflecting on oneself"*—this is Zengzi’s firing. *"Daily knowing what one lacks, monthly not forgetting what one has mastered"*—this is Xia’s firing. *"Vigilant where unseen, fearful where unheard"*—this is Zisi’s firing. *"Engage in the task without fixating the mind, neither forgetting nor forcing growth"*—this is Mencius’ firing.

*"Forgetting food in fervent pursuit"*—this is Confucius’ martial fire. *"Forgetting sorrow in joy"*—this is Confucius’ civil fire. *"Unaware of old age’s approach"*—this is the firing of utter sincerity without cease, where the firing is pure. When the firing is pure, the great elixir is complete, and the work of sagehood is fulfilled.

**Oral Instructions of the Fifth Section of the *Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life, the Ultimate Principles of the Myriad Spirits*:**
*"Heaven and Earth unite, refining away ore to retain gold"*
*(Diagram of Heaven and Earth’s Union)*
*(Including the Oral Instructions of the Mao-You Circulation of the Celestial Cycle)*

Previously, I spoke of nature and life as unified within them—this is the superior method. Now, I speak of nature and life as returning to their root—this is the most superior method. For the method of unifying nature and life within them is already rare; since the time of Zhong and Lü, few in the world have known it. How much rarer still is the method of returning nature and life to their root? Yet for such profound subtleties of the wondrous aperture and the mysteries of nature and life, if I do not repeat and emphasize, scholars will find it difficult to awaken.

Originally, before the birth from father and mother, the original substance was merely the Great Void—what else but the Wuji? Then, with the union of father and mother, a single spark of numinous light emerged—what else but the Taiji? And this spark of numinous light, originally arising from the Taiji, is one’s primordial spirit. From this comes qi, and from qi comes form; one only knows of this form and qi. Fine clothing and food nourish this body; fame, wealth, and honor exalt it. Living thus, dying thus, one believes this is fulfillment. Yet what Zisi called *"the nature endowed by Heaven"* is not only unknown but even undesired. And why is it undesired? Is it not what Mencius called *"losing one’s original heart, which cannot be abandoned"*?

If one could know the way and return to seek it, restoring the original Great Void’s primordial qi and the former state of that single spark of numinous light, nothing but the great Dao of the golden elixir would suffice. Yet the golden elixir’s secrecy lies in the two words: *nature* and *life*. Nature is Heaven, ever latent within the crucible; thus, the crown is nature’s root. Life is the sea, ever latent within the navel; thus, the navel is life’s girdle. As the classic says: *"Nature is at Heaven’s edge, life at the sea’s bottom."*

For the aperture within Heaven is round and stores nature, able to communicate with the aperture within Earth. Thus, its penetration flows from above to below, directly nurturing without harm. The aperture within Earth is square and stores life, able to communicate with the aperture within Heaven. Thus, its penetration flows from below to above, directly nurturing without harm. Confucius said: *"The wise emulate Heaven’s roundness in motion; the benevolent emulate Earth’s squareness in stillness."* What is Heaven’s roundness? The meaning of *"round and complete"*—where nature resides, the root of life. What is Earth’s squareness? The meaning of *"square and measured"*—where life is bound, the root of nature.

Nature and life, though seemingly two, are fundamentally one. Concealed in Heaven, it is Heaven; concealed in Earth, it is Earth—vast and boundless, without form or direction. In the eyes, it sees; in the ears, it hears; in the nose, it discerns scents; in the mouth, it speaks; in the hands, it grasps; in the feet, it moves. The awakened know it as Buddha-nature; the deluded call it the spirit-soul. For this *"Buddha-nature"* is the original nature—is it not the true nature one has always possessed? This true nature is the *"Heaven-endowed nature."* As it transcends all bounds, it is called *"the center."* As it is utterly without falsehood, it is called *"sincerity."* As it shares the same substance with all things, it is called *"benevolence."* As it is supremely honorable without equal, it is called *"the solitary."* A single, undivided whole—nothing lacking, nothing in excess.

When the Great Ultimate first divides and the Two Modes begin to separate, the light and pure ascend while the heavy and turbid sink. Thus, in the Kan palace there is lead, and in the Li palace there is mercury—what was once called "one thing divided into two" now bears the names of these two. These two names, the alchemical classics dare not reveal outright; instead, they employ myriad metaphors, a thousand names and ten thousand terms, beyond counting.

When speaking of the nature within the crown, it is likened to mercury, the dragon, fire, the root, the sun, the hun-soul, Li, Qian, Ji, Heaven, the sovereign, the void, the hare, nothingness, the master, the floating, cinnabar, Fusang, the maiden, Kunlun. When speaking of the life-force within the navel, it is likened to lead, the tiger, water, the stem, the moon, the po-soul, Kan, Kun, Wu, Earth, the minister, the solid, the crow, being, the guest, the sinking, quicksilver, Huayue, the infant, Qujiang.

As for yin containing yang and yang concealing yin, a thousand words and ten thousand discourses serve only to illustrate these two names. Thus, the *Yuanhuang Formula* states:
*Lead and mercury dwell within the crucible,*
*Refined into a priceless pearl.*
*All comes down to these two words,*
*Which encompass the teachings of ten thousand households.*

Master Zhongli said: *"Apart from mercury and lead, the two medicines, all else is deception to delude the foolish."* Gao Xiangxian said: *"In a dream, I ascended to the Western Flower and reached the Ninth Heaven, where the Perfected One bestowed upon me the *Zhixuan Chapter*. Within it, there is little complexity—only the instruction to refine mercury and lead."* Ma Danyang said: *"Lead and mercury are water and fire; water and fire are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are spirit and qi; spirit and qi are nature and life. All ultimately return to these two words, and these two words are but a single principle."*

Thus, those who blindly cultivate divide them into two, while true cultivators unite them as one. To unite them is to refine qi and coalesce spirit, to fulfill nature and attain life, to temper lead and dry mercury, to extract Kan and fill Li. Within Li resides a numinous essence called the *flowing pearl*; when lodged in spirit, it flits restlessly; when lodged in essence, it is difficult to preserve. Hence, Immortal Ge composed the *Song of the Flowing Pearl*, lamenting its unruliness and ease of loss. Did not Wei Boyang say: *"The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man; only when it obtains golden blossoms does it turn and remain"*? And again: *"The maiden of the Yellow River, numinous and most divine, to restrain her, the yellow sprout must serve as root."*

The *golden blossom* and the *yellow sprout* both refer to true lead—true lead being the essence of the Great Yin. The *flowing pearl* and the *maiden* both refer to numinous mercury—numinous mercury being the qi of the Great Yang. Yet this numinous mercury is fiercely volatile; at the sight of fire, it flees without trace. Without true lead, how can it be subdued? Thus, Master Ziyang said: *"What is essential is to seek the Golden Duke for restraint."* The Golden Duke is lead. Lead arises from Qujiang, piercing the spine, penetrating the Jade Capital, and spiraling upward to the Mud Pill. Though called "drawing lead to replenish mercury," it is in truth the return of essence to nourish the brain.

The *Cui Xu Chapter* states:
*Heaven has seven stars, Earth seven treasures,*
*Man has seven orifices, all governed by the brain.*

The *Tai Gu Collection* states:
*When the golden elixir reaches the Mud Pill Palace,*
*First inscribe your name in the Jade Register.*

The *Dharma Treasure and Lost Pearl* states:
*Only when you recognize your original true face*
*Do you know that life and death lie in the Mud Pill.*

The *Yellow Court Classic* states:
*The Mud Pill governs a hundred nodes, all with spirits.*
And again:
*The spirit-root of the brain is called the Mud Pill.*
And again:
*The face’s spirit is ruled by the Mud Pill;*
*The Mud Pill’s nine perfected ones each have their chambers.*
*Within this square-inch space,*
*Meditate on this single realm to attain boundless longevity.*

This square-inch space is where Śākyamuni received prophecy upon his crown. Here lies the mystery within mystery, the heaven within heaven: the *Yuluo Xiaotai*, the *Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital*; the *crimson chamber of brain-blood*, the *jade chamber of the hun-soul and essence*, the *life-dwelling of a hundred spirits*, the *mountain source of fluids*. This is precisely the cavity where the two ears communicate, behind the *Bright Hall* and before the *Jade Pillow*, beneath the *Canopy* and above the *Crimson Palace*, at the *North Pole’s Supreme Abyss*—the true chamber where the *Primordial One’s* spirit resides.

Formerly, the Yellow Emperor ascended Mount Emei and beheld the Perfected Sovereign of Heaven in the Jade Hall, where he inquired about the Way of the *Primordial One*. The Sovereign replied: *"This is the most revered of the Daoist arts, hidden by the Lord on High within the Five Cities of Kunlun. Sealed in a jade casket, inscribed on golden tablets, bound with purple clay, and stamped with the central seal. I have heard from the clouds of essence: it resides in the *North Pole’s Supreme Abyss*, before the *Bright Hall* and behind the *Jade Pillow*, above the *Canopy* and below the *Crimson Palace*.*

*The towering Canopy, a golden dome soaring,*
*Left the Big Dipper, right the Great Square, waves surging in the void.*
*Purple mushrooms cling to cliffs, red grasses shimmer,*
*White jade peaks rise, sun and moon cast their light.*
*Passing through fire, crossing water, traversing the mysterious and the yellow,*
*City gates interlock, curtains and jades gleam.*
*Dragons and tigers fiercely guard, divine beings attend.*
*Neither given nor taken, it rests in its place;*
*Neither slow nor swift, it abides in its chamber.*
*At ease yet prepared, it never departs.*
*Guard the One and preserve the true—thus the One connects to the divine.*
*Reduce desires and moderate food—thus the One retains breath.*
*Even with blades at your neck, think of the One to survive.*
*To know the One is not difficult; difficulty lies in persevering to the end.*
*Guard it without fail, and you may endure forever."*

This is a brief outline of the *Primordial One’s* secret teachings. Thus, the *Dao De Jing* states: *"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; spirits attain the One and become numinous; valleys attain the One and become full; the myriad things attain the One and come to life; kings and lords attain the One and become rulers of the world."*

What is called "spirit" is to know the future, and what is called "knowledge" is to store the past. What is called "great and transformative" is sageliness, and what is called "sagely yet unknowable" is spirit. Divided into two, it is the root of yin and yang. Divided into five, it is the pivot of the Five Phases. Further divided into eight, eight times eight yields sixty-four, the number of the *River Chart*. Further divided into nine, nine times nine yields eighty-one, the number of the *Luo Writing*. Scattered into the myriad, it becomes the warp and weft of the ceaseless transformation of the ten thousand things.

Fuxi and King Wen grasped the One, and the *Zhouyi* arose. Yu and Ji grasped the One, and the *Great Plan* was established. Zhou Maoshu grasped the One, and the *Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate* emerged. Shao Yaofu grasped the One, and the *Model of the World* was composed. Laozi grasped the One, and the myriad affairs were perfected. Śākyamuni grasped the One, and the myriad dharmas returned to it.

To return to the root is to return to this. To recover life is to recover this. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: *"If one can guard the One, the One will guard that person. When one hungers while contemplating the One, the One provides grain. When one thirsts while contemplating the One, the One provides drink."*

The *Spiritual Pivot* states: *"The Celestial Valley’s primordial spirit, guarded, remains true."* It also says: *"If you desire long life, embrace the One and be enlightened."* And further: *"Embrace the One and guard truth, and spirit will naturally become numinous."*

If one can hold fast to spirit and guard the One within the original palace, true *qi* will naturally ascend, true breath will naturally settle, true essence will naturally gather, the numinous sprout will naturally grow, the Gate of Heaven will naturally open, and the primordial spirit will naturally manifest. When the crown aperture opens, all apertures open in unison; when the primordial spirit abides, all spirits obey its command. If spirit abides in its aperture and does not scatter, how can one die?

This is what the *Yellow Court Scripture* means when it says: *"If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun."* Thus Qiu Chuji said:
*"To gaze long upon Kunlun is to guard the true One,
Guarding the mani jewel, round and crimson.
In clarity and vastness, the gate of the Tathāgata,
From here emerge ten thousand buddhas and a thousand immortals."*

The *Chapter on Returning to the Origin* states:
*"Awakening to the Dao, bright and boundless,
Serene and composed, one moves the Celestial Pass.
This is the foundational work,
The art of turning the Celestial Pass within the head’s chambers,
The sacred writ to cast off the register of death."*

This Dao is what High Heaven conceals, and neither immortals nor buddhas of past and present dare speak of it plainly. Truly, among a thousand or ten thousand, only one or two know it. Profound! Profound! There are yet more oral instructions that cannot be fully expressed.

Once more, I urge you: when true lead enters the crucible, you must dispel all stray thoughts, rouse your spirit with haste, fix your gaze upon the crown of the head, and concentrate your intent without distraction. In an instant, dragon and tiger engage in battle, creation and transformation vie in flux—thunder roars, lightning flashes, shaking heaven and earth. The hundred meridians shudder, the nine palaces become transparent; golden essence pours into the crown, silver waves surge to the sky.

As Master Ziyang said:
*"From black it transforms to red,
A single crucible thick with cloudy qi."*

After a moment, the jade crucible’s brew warms, the golden furnace’s fire scatters; yellow sprouts cover the earth, white snow blankets the sky. Husband sings, wife follows; dragon hums, tiger roars. Yin clings to yang’s soul, yang embraces yin’s essence. Lead’s essence and mercury’s marrow congeal like a pearl.

As Master Yuchan said:
*"When the old couple meet again,
Their affection lingers of its own.
At this moment, the mysterious pearl forms,
The ore departs, leaving only gold."*

And that single drop of golden liquid returns to its former place in the Yellow Court.

At this time, it flows like mountain clouds rising into the vast void, drifts like fine rain spreading across the plains, seeps like spring showers filling the marsh, and melts like river ice about to break. The hundred meridians pulse in harmony, coursing through the four limbs—truly, one’s entire being brims with spring’s warmth.

Upon witnessing this effect, swiftly circulate the *mao-you* cycle of the microcosmic orbit, advance the yang fire, retreat the yin tally, so that east and west converge, south and north merge. Then the Four Symbols and Five Phases gather in the crucible, the numinous coalesces in the Celestial Valley, and the five qi are ordered in the Mud Pill Palace.

As Gao Xiangxian said:
*"The mysterious pearl flies to Kunlun’s summit—
If you seek it, rely on the formless."*

The *He Dong Song* states:
*"Two substances captured in a single furnace,
A pool of divine water congeals into true suet."*

The *Zhi Xuan Pian* says:
*"You must know where east and west unite,
Crucial is the harmony of upper and lower fields."*

Chen Niniwan said:
*"Since the White Tiger first appeared,
How could the flowing pearl refuse to follow?"*

Master Duan said:
*"Where the Four Symbols and Five Phases gather,
Heaven and earth, sun and moon naturally return."*

The *Jian Wu Ji* states:
*"Because the elixir’s fire burns below,
The Yellow River’s waters reverse their flow."*

The *Chun Cui Yin* says:
*"Before the *zi-wu* furnace, advance and retreat are distinct;
Within the *qian-kun* crucible, floating and sinking are arrayed."*

The *Xuan Ao Ji* notes:
*"Metal dissolves wood’s nature in mutual union,
Black mercury and lead bond through spontaneous resonance."*

Master Yunfang said:
*"Turning the Dipper’s handle governs the Mysterious Pass,
Revolving the Celestial Pivot unites the ten thousand images.
In a moment, dragon and tiger cease their struggle,
As the two substances unite in an instant."*

The *Zhi Xuan Pian* says:
*"Rushing back to the Sea of Qi, it is called the Crimson Steed;
Flying into the Mud Pill Palace, it is the White Crow.
Last night, after dragon and tiger ceased their battle,
Amid the snow, the crescent moon faintly appears."*

The *Xing Yan Shi* states:
*"Wood and metal, separated by east and west,
Clouds rise with the dragon’s hum and the tiger’s roar.
The two substances, though few, turn heaven and earth—
Fortunately, through *wu-ji*, yin and yang unite."*

Chen Niniwan said:
*"At the *zi* hour, qi reaches the Weilu Pass,
Crossing the Jiaji to the eastern river, piercing Zeng Mountain.
A crystal droplet enters the furnace—
The Red Dragon releases mercury to ascend the Mud Pill Palace."*

The *Cui Xu Pian* says:
*"When drunkenness deepens and sleep grows sound,
A boat laden with treasures sails into Cao Creek.
Once the elixir’s foundation is discerned,
Whether released or gathered, it remains the same."*

An ancient immortal’s song:
*"Mercury alone is the immortal’s medicine,
Passed down from above, yet taming fire is difficult.
If it meets the eastern river and turns to purple powder,
A single breath of powdery frost transforms into the golden elixir."*

The *Xuan Ao Ji* states:
*"Move the Northern Dipper past the Southern Star,
With both hands, lift the sun and moon’s wheels.
Flying to Kunlun’s summit to emerge,
In an instant, it becomes a cloud filling the sky."*

Yin Changsheng said:
*"When night deepens and dragon hums, tiger roars,
Hurry to drive the eastern river without pause.
Send the flying essence to Kunlun’s peak,
Advance the fire in the jade furnace, refining it like snow."*

Zhang Yuanhua said:
*"Following the current straight to Penglai,
It scatters in sweet springs, moistening the nine realms.
From this, the Elixir Field is bathed in moisture—
Yellow sprouts bloom everywhere at once."*

The *Yuan Dao Ge* says:
*"Wondrously move the Elixir Field up and down,
Know that the whole must unite east and west.
Laughing, I point to Kunlun’s summit—
Clearly, a path runs through the Jiaji."*

The *Xuan Ao Ji* notes:
*"Alone I ascend Kunlun, gazing into the vault of heaven,
Dragon’s hum and tiger’s roar resound distinctly.
The Jade Pool constantly drips yin and yang’s marrow,
The Golden Crucible often refines sun and moon’s essence."*

The *Qun Xian Zhu Yu* states:
*"The single point of cinnabar’s work differs—
Seek the red blood within *kan*.
Seize it from *li* to restrain yin’s essence,
Harmonizing and blending at the proper time."*

The *Jin Dan Ji* says:
*"Transporting the eastern river to Kunlun’s summit,
Without moving a hair, it reaches the Jade Pass.
The wonder lies in the eight gates tightly sealed—
Yin and yang’s qi circulates of its own accord."*

The *Wu Yi Ge* states:
*"At this stage, forget one and embrace the other,
Then you may emerge and vanish with the primordial transformation.
If you cling to one and cannot forget,
You resemble a foolish cat guarding an empty burrow."*

Bai Yuchan said:
*"Refine the mercury-heart to forge the Red Dragon’s nature,
Temper the lead-body to congeal the White Tiger’s life.
Within and without, not a trace of yin remains—
Amid the myriad images’ radiance, the Jade Clarity mirror."*

The *Chunyang Wenji* says:
*"Stealing the ancestors of heaven and earth,
Yin and yang are the root.
The celestial soul gives birth to the White Tiger,
The earthly po produces the Green Dragon.
Transport the treasure to dwell in the Mud Pill Palace,
Move the essence into the upper palace.
Whoever understands this method
Will retain a youthful appearance for ten thousand years."*

The *Baoyizi Xian Dao Tu* states:
*"The Dao’s creation was never difficult—
The work lies solely in stillness.
Yin and yang constantly ascend and descend,
Metal and water circulate and return of themselves.
The Purple Mansion’s Green Dragon embraces the White Tiger,
The Mysterious Palace’s earthly axis joins the Celestial Pass.
Clouds gather, rain scatters, the spiritual embryo forms—
A man giving birth to a child is no ordinary matter."*

The *Xuan Ao Ji* says:
*"To know the Mysterious Pass’s true location,
Look where the boy and girl laugh, pointing to the highest peak.
The highest peak—
Lush and wondrous,
On its far shore, purple mushrooms sprout in the mist."*

Only this is the elixir of immortality—
Countless practitioners remain unaware.

The *Xuan Zhu Ge* of Xu Xuanping states:
The sun in the sky turns below the earth,
The moon at the ocean’s depths flies above the heavens.
Heaven and earth, sun and moon do not move of themselves—
All turns by the handle of the Dipper’s mechanism.
If the human heart aligns with the heart of Heaven,
Yin and yang invert in but a single moment.
When dragon and tiger cease their battle and the Three Fields grow still,
Gather the Mysterious Pearl and plant it in the mud.

The *Qun Xian Zhu Yu Ge* says:
Lead longs for mercury, mercury longs for lead,
Seizing the creative power of Heaven and Earth.
Life and nature boil down to two words,
Hidden within ten thousand scrolls of alchemical classics.

*Mao-You Circulation of the Celestial Sphere* (*Zhou Tian Xuan Ji Tu*)
The first stage: union of Heaven and Earth—gathering the outer medicine.
This stage: the Mao-You circulation—gathering the inner medicine.
Outer union: behind ascends, before descends—one rise, one fall.
Inner union: left revolves, right turns—one ascent, one descent.
The two cycle endlessly, resembling the turning of the celestial sphere.
Thus Wei Boyang said: *"Following the turning of the sphere, ascending and descending, circulating through the six lines—difficult to perceive."*

People know only of the union of Heaven and Earth,
Yet remain unaware of the Mao-You circulation—
This is like having a carriage without wheels,
A boat without a rudder.
How can one hope to travel far?

Thus the *Huan Yuan Pian* states:
The jade hare and golden crow wheel in cycles,
The Dao resides within the human body, yet people remain deluded.
All see how to regulate water and fire,
But how many recognize East and West at the end?

East is the nature of water.
West is the sentiment of metal.
One thing divided in two, separated by East and West.
Now, with the handle of the Dipper’s mechanism turning,
Wood’s nature loves metal, metal’s sentiment longs for wood—
The two intertwine, and metal and wood unite.
Only when metal and wood unite is the full work of water and fire achieved.
The alchemical classics call this *"harmonizing the Four Images."*

Thus Zhang Quanyi’s *Lead-Fire Secret Formula* says:
The Great Medicine arises at a specific time—
The last hour of *Hai*, the first of *Zi*, the dead of night.
Spirit and essence unite in radiant splendor,
Faintly, indistinctly, the bright moon is born.
When union ceases, it flows down in a bubbling stream—
The first yang revives; do not let it leak.
Hasten to seal it within the Gate of Great Mystery,
Fire drives the medicine past the *Weilü* cavity.
At the moment of gathering, use the eyes to guard the *Niwan*,
Lowering from the left, then pausing to concentrate.
This is called *"gazing upward to ascend the mysterious"*—
From the right, let it descend, then rise again.
After thirty-six repetitions, the medicine matures,
Yang reaches its peak, yin arises, shifting to the right.
Open the gate to withdraw the fire,
The eyes’ gaze descends to guard the *Kun* Field.
From the right upward, then left downward to settle—
Twenty-four repetitions complete one celestial cycle.
This is the natural true firing time,
Naturally ascending and descending, naturally adding and withdrawing.
No waxing or waning, no new or full moon,
No bathing or lengthy chapters.
Discard all metaphors and sweeping comparisons—
Only these two lines are the true essence.

Its method follows the union of Heaven and Earth,
So the congealed golden elixir does not dissipate.
First, use the dharmic instrument to seal the Gate of Great Mystery,
Then, with the governing qi, direct the gaze downward to the *Kun* navel.
After a long while, slowly guide it upward from the left to the *Qian* crown.
Pause briefly, then descend from the right to the *Kun* navel—
This is one cycle.
Again, from the *Kun* navel ascend to the *Qian* crown,
Then from the *Qian* crown descend to the *Kun* navel.
Thirty-six such revolutions constitute *"advancing the yang fire."*
After thirty-six cycles, close the gate to withdraw the fire,
Also directing the gaze downward to the *Kun* navel,
From the right upward to the *Qian* crown,
Then from the left downward to the *Kun* navel—
This is one cycle.
Twenty-four such revolutions constitute *"retreating the yin tally."*
After twenty-four cycles.

Thus Zhang Ziyang said:
The Dipper’s handle establishes the four seasons,
The eight nodes are never without their cares.
Yet the Dipper’s pivot remains utterly still—
Only the handle and scoop move of themselves.
Simply keep the two eyes bright,
Exchanging above and below.
Proceed in stillness,
Not in haste.

Why use the two eyes’ brightness?
The eyes are yang apertures.
The entire human body belongs to yin—
Only this single point is yang.
With this single point of yang,
From below to above, from left to right,
Turning and turning again,
Battling the host of yin,
The Dao of yang daily grows,
The Dao of yin daily wanes.
Thus the *Yi* says: *"The dragon battles in the wilds, its blood dark yellow."*
It also enables the true qi to circulate up and down,
Like the turning of the Milky Way—
The eyes’ function is truly great.

When a person first forms in the womb,
Heaven’s one generates water—first the black pupil forms, with the pupil belonging to the kidneys.
Earth’s two generates fire—thus the two canthi belong to the heart.
Heaven’s three generates wood—thus the black iris belongs to the liver.
Earth’s four generates metal—thus the whites belong to the lungs.
Heaven’s five generates earth—thus the upper and lower eyelids belong to the spleen.
From this, we see that the essence of the five viscera all emanates from the eyes.

After my teacher pointed out this aperture,
I observed women who miscarried, half-formed fetuses,
And even eggs held by hens—
All first formed their two eyes, while the viscera remained unshaped.
Only then did I realize the eyes are the spirit of prior Heaven,
The dwelling place of the primordial spirit.

The *Huangji Jingshi Shu* states:
The spirit of Heaven abides in the sun;
The spirit of humans manifests in the eyes.
How great it is—the spirit of humans manifests in the eyes!
At birth, this thing precedes Heaven and Earth;
At death, this thing departs before Heaven and Earth.
Water, fire, wood, metal, earth—the Five Phases—
Converge here.
Liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys—the five viscera—
Are endowed with numen here.
Saliva, mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood, humor—the seven substances—
Crystallize their brilliance here.
In its vastness, it can contain Heaven and Earth;
In its smallness, not even a hair’s tip can enter.

Is this not the great treasure within my very body? The *Neizhi Tongxuan Jue* states:
*"To contain light is the very elixir of growth,
Transforming bone to gold, the highest immortal."*

Master Shangyang says:
*"The subtle and wondrous secret is not far—
It lies right before the eyes, yet men overlook it."*

The *Chongzheng Pian* declares:
*"With ceaseless effort day and night, the turning reaches its sublime,
The body’s mechanism, like the revolving jade sphere."*

The *Huohou Ge* sings:
*"To penetrate the profoundest mystery, guard solitude with care,
For in solitude’s work, the mechanism lies within the eyes."*

Chen Niuwan says:
*"True yin and true yang are the Dao,
Yet they dwell right before the eyes—why seek afar?"*

Xue Daoguang observes:
*"It is clearly there before your eyes,
Yet men of this age fail to see Heaven."*

Liu Haichan teaches:
*"Descending and ascending along the body’s axis,
Leftward and rightward revolutions align with the pivot’s workings."*

Wang Zizhen recounts:
*"Last night, the maiden of alchemy opened the numinous gate,
Revealing immortals gathered in the Purple Tenuity.
The Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms arrayed front and back,
The two wheels of sun and moon flying to and fro."*

Xiao Zixu says:
*"Like a dragon tending its pearl, ever watchful,
Like a hen brooding her eggs, ever embracing.
The golden liquor and returning elixir lie before your eyes—
Many are deluded, few awaken."*

Chen Cuixu declares:
*"Not lamp-light, nor sun, moon, or stars,
The elixir’s spirit shines with extraordinary brightness.
With long and steady gaze behind lowered lids,
A radiant orb manifests—your original truth."*

The *Cuixu Pian* admonishes:
*"Do not dismiss the golden elixir as trivial,
But strive with diligence, gathering and refining.
Discuss earnestly with master and disciple,
For it lies not elsewhere, but right before you."*

The *Xuan Kun Ji* states:
*"How many years since the Azure Ox departed?
Yet this Dao remains clearly before your eyes.
To recognize the true place before you,
A hall where wind chills and the moon is fair."*

Chen Niuwan repeats:
*"The Great Dao is plainly before your eyes,
Yet men of this age, failing to grasp it, amuse themselves until the grave.
The yellow sprout is the qi of Heaven and Earth,
The root of divine water linked to mercury."*

The *Xuanxue Tongzong* recounts:
*"Time and again, ascending Kunlun’s heights,
Revolving the jade sphere, parting the workings of creation.
Day and night cycling, returning to the origin,
From this, the infant’s life endures."*

The *Guanwu Pangan Ge* sings:
*"This treasure, this profound wonder—
Its wonder lies in ever observing its aperture.
This aperture is clearly before your eyes,
Yet lesser men, hearing of it, laugh aloud."*

The *Jindan Fu* describes:
*"Calling the dragon, inhaling the tiger,
Soul swallowing, spirit exhaling.
North and South unite in water and fire,
Mao and You revolve in Zi and Wu.
Encompassing Qian and Kun’s strategies,
The master of leisurely transformation.
Mother and child enveloped in the vessel’s frame,
Nurtured and reared within the cauldron."*

Master Jun of Zhuyu Mountain says:
*"Awakening within awakening, realization within realization,
A single point of numinous light, unobstructed.
Unleashed, its fierce blaze illumines the world,
The Dharma-realm’s expanse uniquely revealed.
These subtle workings are most profound—
The wooden man points afar to the white clouds’ return.
This mysterious pass is hard to describe,
Yet once seen before you, all schemes are forgotten."*

Nanguzi declares:
*"The Supreme Dao is not distant—
It ever abides in the aperture before you.
Seizing Heaven and Earth’s mechanism,
Cultivate and perfect the immortal embryo."*

Master Chunyang says:
*"When asked of my practice’s method,
I point afar to the sun and moon’s wheel."*

All these refined words of the immortals elucidate the principle of governing qi. For this section’s work shares the same principle as the fourth, seamlessly linking above and below like strung pearls: gathering the medicinal substance from beneath the winding river, igniting the fire to ascend to Qian; Qian and Kun unite above the nine palaces, the revolving heavens condense and coalesce within the cauldron.

Zhang Ziyang says:
*"Though but a moment’s work,
It secures boundless ease and joy forever."*

The light and pure condense in the Mud Pill Palace,
the heavy and turbid flow back to the Qi Cavern.
Day by day, thus drawing and replenishing,
thus uniting in embrace—
mercury gradually increases,
lead gradually diminishes.
With time, lead nears exhaustion,
mercury too desiccates,
congealing into a single mani pearl:
this is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor.

Thus Ma Yifu declares:
*"Gather the gold within water,
pluck the bodhi seed.
Circulate the Kunlun wind—
longevity transcends life and death."*

For the lead within Kan
is originally the father’s true essence;
the mercury within Li
is originally the mother’s true blood.
At first, when Qian’s body was sundered,
the two substances parted to opposing arcs.
Thus common folk daily depart and daily divide,
until division is complete—and death ensues.

Therefore the perfected emulate Qian and Kun’s body,
model Kan and Li’s function,
seize the divine work,
alter Heaven’s mandate.
They seek the lead within Kan,
restrain the mercury within Li,
extract Kan’s yang,
fill Li’s mercury.
Yin exhausted, yang pure—
Qian’s original body is restored.

Thus Zhang Ziyang says:
*"Take the solid core from Kan’s position,
transmute the yin within Li’s palace.
From this, transform into Qian’s robust body—
hidden or soaring, all follows the heart’s will."*

**Sixth Section Oral Instructions of the *Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life, the Pinnacle of Myriad Spirits***
The numinous elixir enters the cauldron to nurture the sacred embryo
*(Diagram of the Numinous Elixir Entering the Cauldron)*
*(Internal Fire Timing Attached)*

At the origin, that speck of primal essence-gold lies undifferentiated within the ore. Pressed by fire, it ascends to the Qian Palace. Gradually gathered, gradually accumulated, refined and smelted, diminished again and again, tempered again and again—until smoke vanishes and fire subsides, ore is exhausted and gold purified—only then does this single grain of Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir form. Round and full, vibrant and fluid, like dew, like lightning, neither mist nor smoke, radiant and flashing, its brilliance illumines Kunlun. When released, it bursts open the apertures of Heaven and Earth; when returned, it conceals itself within the Emerald Micro-Palace. At this moment, medicine no longer arises, the wheel no longer turns, fluids no longer descend, fire no longer flames. The five qi all ascend to the Upper Yang; the three essences all gather at the Qian crown. Yang pure, yin stripped away—elixir ripens, pearl quickens.

Master Ziyang says:
*"When the host of yin is stripped away and the elixir ripens,
leaping from the cage, one attains ten thousand years of life."*

Thus many of the corpse-liberated immortals of the Tang and Song parted ways at this juncture, freely assuming bodies at will, appearing and vanishing as they pleased, unwilling to advance another step beyond the hundred-foot pole. Hence the ridicule of the seven destinies and the reproach of falling into emptiness. For they knew not how to re-establish the nature and life of the self, to re-create one’s own Qian and Kun, to transform conditioned nature into Buddha-nature, to transmute consciousness into primordial spirit—the wondrous art of self-creation and self-transformation. If those of the Life School do not understand how to act as their own creators, they merely sit in desiccated side doors, and their Dao is not the true Dao. If those of the Nature School do not understand how to act as their own creators, they merely cling to vacuous emptiness, and their Buddhism is not the true Buddhism. This method is deeply guarded by the immortals, perfected ones, and buddha-ancestors; even since the Jin and Yuan dynasties, few among the Dao-seekers have known it.

Only my master, Master Yin, said:
*"The treasure within the cauldron is not the true treasure;
only the re-condensation of the numinous embryo is the sacred embryo."*

Yet if the pearl rests upon Kunlun, how can it descend to form the sacred embryo? It must borrow the divine hut, steal the true qi of numinous yang to hasten it, and employ the true fire of Great Yang to press it. After prolonged hastening and pressing, the numinous elixir detaches in due time, swallowed into the mouth and transformed into golden liquid, shooting straight into the chamber of the elixir. In an instant, clouds surge and rain descends, lightning flashes and thunder roars. In the span of a fierce battle, all the yin dregs of the body are consumed. Then the hundred spirits, like spokes converging on a hub, and the seven treasures, like rivers flowing to the sea, all gather here.

The Supreme Primordial Lord once said to Laozi:
*"When the divine elixir enters the mouth, life knows no end."*
Thus Laozi cultivated it and became the Ancestor of the Dao.

Xu Xuanping said:
*"When spirit dwells in the aperture, a thousand wisdoms arise;
when the elixir enters the cauldron, ten thousand transformations unfold."*

Chen Xubai said:
*"When I first condensed the sacred embryo,
the hundred vessels all stilled, qi no longer scattered."*

Shi Jianwu said:
*"Heaven and man share the same qi,
each sensing and communicating with the other.
Yang comes from the void,
embracing me, the master."*

Yet once the numinous elixir has entered the cauldron, through inner and outer dual cultivation, refined again and again, one must ultimately attain the virtue of Heaven and Earth uniting. Then, within the Great Void, a speck of true yang naturally arises to merge with my numinous elixir as one. For when my spirit resonates with the spirit of Heaven and Earth, inner truth and outer response blend seamlessly. The *Scripture of Gold and Azure* says: *"The lodestone draws iron—though separated by barriers, they connect in secret."* This expresses the same principle. This stage of practice relies entirely on utmost stillness.

Laozi said:
*"If one can always remain clear and still,
Heaven and Earth all return to them."*

When the two yangs first unite and the sacred embryo begins to condense, one must constantly maintain awareness, guarding and nurturing it closely—like a young dragon first nurturing its pearl, or a maiden newly with child. Secure the chamber of spirit, allowing no leakage.

Thus the Perfected of Great White said:
*"If the seal holds firm without leakage,
transformation occurs in an instant."*

Moreover, in all moments, within the four dignified postures, one must always attend to it, thought after thought fixed here, in a state of primal chaos, as if within the mother’s womb—all day appearing foolish yet never straying, never breaking for even a moment.

Master Ge the Immortal said:
*"Breath after breath returns to the center without interruption;
within the womb of celestial truth, the embryo naturally solidifies."*

Zhang Yongcheng said:
*"Once the single grain of numinous elixir is swallowed into the belly,
only then does one know that my life is not determined by Heaven."*

Shi Dezhi said:
*"Held in the palm, its rosy light gleams;
swallowed into the belly, the palace is renewed."*

Zhao Yuandu said:
*"The divine elixir descends into the golden chamber;
the infant is born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss."*

Lü Chunyang said:
*"The knife’s master has consumed the elixir, the scripture descends—
leaping from the dusty cage to ascend the nine heavens."*

Master Zhu said:
*"Once the elixir-knife enters the mouth,
white daylight wings sprout."*

Li Qing’an said:
*"A single precious pearl swallowed into the belly
makes one a complete immortal and celestial kin."*

Chen Tuan said:
*"Vast, without trace, it returns to the elixir chamber;
in secret, the mechanism forms the sacred embryo."*

Xue Zixian said:
*"The four images converge within wu and ji;
after ten months of diligence, the infant is born."*

The *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Fruit on the branch will ripen in time;
how is the child in the womb any different?"*

The *Drunken Chant* says:
*"The precious pearl dances, laughing, as it leaves the celestial valley—
scarcely freed from one womb before entering another."*

Zhang Ziyang said:
*"The infant is a single breath of true qi;
after ten months, the embryo rounds and enters the sacred foundation."*

Lü Chunyang said:
*"Heaven engenders one thing, transforming the Three Powers;
through the union of yin and yang, the sacred embryo forms."*

Bai Yuchan said:
*"The hen, brooding her eggs, listens with constant heart;
the cicada, once formed, sheds its shell."*

Yu Shijian said:
*"The tiger roars once, the dragon emerges from its cave;
phoenix and luan dance, entering the golden city."*

The *Pearls and Jade of the Immortals* says:
*"Consuming a single grain, one attains the longevity of Heaven and Earth—
life and death, death and life, no longer concern them."*

Zhang Ziyang said:
*"Swallowing and gulping, yet ever intimate—
only then does one realize the man has conceived."*

Master Zhongli said:
*"Once the infant within the womb is complete,
diligently apply the work of warmth and nurturance."*

At all times, illumine the cinnabar chamber; in every moment, guard the Yellow Center.

Chen Niniu said:
*"The man who conceives is a womb-immortal—
only because the toad’s light waxes full each night.
Seizing Heaven’s mechanism, true creation,
within his body he holds the Jade Pure Heaven."*

Chen Baoyi said:
*"The Great Dao, impartial, responds when moved—
how could the immortals’ words be empty?
If one does not intent on seeking lead and mercury,
how could one awaken to Heaven’s mechanism and form the sacred embryo?"*

The *Profound Mysteries Collection* says:
*"When the peaches of Lang Garden ripen of themselves,
pluck and consume them—do not delay.
How many times, in secret, have they been stolen?
Countless immortals remain unknown."*

Longmeizi said:
*"Its form is round as a sparrow’s egg,
its intervals smooth as a black pearl.
The Dragon Child, shedding its womb, is swallowed—
this body has already attained the immortality of land-walking."*

The Perfected of Purple Emptiness said:
*"When first refining the returning elixir, one must enter the chamber—
no different from a woman conceiving.
Once the sacred embryo congeals and rounds into completion,
where could there be constraint in movement or stillness?"*

Bai Ziqing said:
*"Harmonize with wu and ji to make the elixir furnace,
refine the red pellet into jade butter.
Gently guard the fire tally for three hundred days—
a single luminous pearl is born."*

Zhang the Perfected One’s song to the Master of White Dragon Grotto:
*"From this, the root and sprout gradually grow,
tended in season with the embrace of true essence.
After ten months, the embryo sheds—stored in the mouth—
unaware, the mortal body already possesses numen."*

Bai Yuchan said:
*"A strange thing, to make one laugh again and again:
now even men can conceive!
Their own essence and blood conjoin in union—
within the body, husband and wife—how wondrous!"*

Huang Yuanji said:
*"Within the tripod, the golden elixir shines resplendent—
no way to pluck it and bring it to the Yellow Chamber.
Suddenly, at midnight, a celestial wind arises,
blowing the numinous child back to its homeland."*

Chen Cuixu said:
*"The Dao requires nurturing the child within nothingness—
in this, there is a true key.
All because the Heavenly Mechanism is wondrously simple,
scattered in the elixir texts, yet unwilling to be revealed."*

Wang Chongyang said:
*"At leisure, by chance, one arrives at Celestial Terrace—
suddenly beholding radiant clouds of five colors unfurling.
Perhaps the golden elixir has just transformed—
taken back into the tripod to form the infant."*

Shangyangzi said:
*"If the Jade Emperor should ask for the elixir material,
take it from the crescent-moon furnace.
Let heroes gallop and swallow a single pellet—
a man conceives for a year’s gestation."*

Chen Zhixu said:
*"Hunger eats, thirst drinks, weariness sleeps—
one path, distinct, the body’s nature.
After ten months, the sacred embryo is complete—
a single thunderclap, and it emerges from the cinnabar mountain."*

As for the teachings of Buddhism, they are no different in this regard.
As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says:
*"Conduct like the Buddha, receiving the Buddha’s qi;
separation like the intermediate-state being, seeking of itself.
The parents’ yin and yang, through dark resonance, enter—
the Tathāgata’s seed is called the Noble Birth Abode.
Having roamed the Dao-womb, partaking of the Awakening-Milk,
like the embryo already formed in human likeness,
without deficiency, it is called the Complete Abode.
In appearance like the Buddha, in mind also the same—
called the Right Mind Abode.
Body and mind unite, forming a whole—
daily increasing, called the Irreversible Abode.
The ten spiritual marks of the body, all at once complete—
called the Youthful Truth-Being Abode.
Formed, emerging from the womb, becoming the Buddha’s child—
called the Dharma Prince Abode.
Manifesting as an adult, like a great king
who delegates all state affairs to the crown prince—
that Kṣatriya king’s heir, grown to maturity,
arrayed for the anointing—called the Anointed Abode."*

Now, entering the Tathāgata’s seed means taking the seed-nature as the Tathāgata’s seed, self-creating the Tathāgata.
Thus it is called the Dao-womb, also called the Awakening-Milk—how is it different from a woman nursing her child, or the Daoist’s womb-immortal?
When formed and emerging from the womb, becoming the Buddha’s child—is this not the true person’s manifestation, great spiritual powers arising from this, where even Heavenly Immortals may offer congratulations?
For both elixir texts and Buddhist scriptures possess sequential oral instructions—only people do not know.
Instead, they glance straight past the essential—like a pearl lying by the road, unnoticed.
How lamentable!
Now I have briefly excerpted these several passages to present them, using the ancient right to correct the modern wrong.

The Fire-Timing (Illustrated by the *Fire-Timing Venerating the True* and *Nurturing the Sacred Embryo* charts)

The Fire-Timing is most esoteric—sages did not transmit it, yet now it is revealed.
Without fire, the medicine does not arise; when the medicine ripens, the fire transforms.
Without medicine, fire does not ignite; when fire arrives, the elixir is complete.

Moreover, the subtleties of Fire-Timing cannot be discussed in a single stroke.
Before obtaining the elixir, one must rely on the martial fire to congeal it; once obtained, one must depend on the civil fire to nurture it.
The civil fire is the fire of fruition.
Its nurturing method lies in regulating its cold and warmth, its ebb and flow.
Thus the *Cantong Qi* says:
*"Observe with utmost care, discerning cold and warmth.
Examine whether the fire has not yet kindled—then borrow the wind of Xun to fan it.
Scrutinize whether the fire has already ignited—then rely on the divine water to enliven it.
If excessive, reduce it; if insufficient, augment it,
so that it attains harmony, free from the maladies of fire’s dryness or fire’s chill."*

For the cold and dryness of fire originate entirely in the arising of intention.
Chen Xubai said:
*"Thoughts must not arise—if they do, fire becomes parched.
Intent must not scatter—if it does, fire turns cold.
Only by ensuring no thought arises and no intent scatters,
abiding in silent radiance, with true breath flowing ceaselessly,
round and luminous in awakened awareness, ever vigilant—
this is the true Fire-Timing for nurturing the sacred embryo."*

Thus Bai Yuchan said:
*"Gather the medicine within immovability, enact the Fire-Timing within non-doing."*
Zhang Sanfeng said:
*"With silence and softness, preserve the fire’s nature;
without forgetting or forcing, nurture the numinous embryo."*
Liu Haichan said:
*"In utter stillness, merge with the supreme treasure;
with gentle warmth, nourish the hidden dragon."*
Zhang Ziyang said:
*"The natural true fire nurtures of itself—
no need for kindling or fanning."*
And again:
*"Do not idly guard the medicine furnace or force the Fire-Timing—
simply settle the spirit and breath, entrusting all to nature."*

These four masters, foremost among the immortals, all attained the supreme and perfect Dao through the natural true fire and its wondrous spontaneity.
When did they ever rely on hexagrams, line counts, weights, or calendrical calculations?

Yet people today misconstrue the immortal masters’ intent, clinging to images and fixating on texts, mistaking the finger for the moon.
They insist on calculating the numerical strategies of hexagrams, seeking to align with the yin and yang of divination manuals.
I fear they will toil their entire lives without success, suddenly collapsing in exhaustion, never knowing their destination.

Have they not seen Zhang Pingxu’s words:
*"Here, to grasp the meaning, one must forget the image—
if you exhaust yourself scrutinizing the lines, you labor in vain."*
Gao Xiangxian said:
*"Day and night, the cycles of Zhun and Meng follow nature—
why trouble yourself endlessly watching the Fire-Timing?"*
Chen Chongsu said:
*"Though fire has its timing, it needs no fixed hour—
the slightest mechanism, I know of myself."*
Peng Zhenyi said:
*"The true fire has always been formless—
without a master’s transmission, it is most difficult."*
Xiao Zixu said:
*"Harmonizing medicine and substance is easily realized by the awakened,
but mastering the Fire-Timing’s ebb and flow may prove arduous."*

Ten months of effort lie in sustaining the faint and ceaseless breath;
thirty thousand years of qi-cycles unfold in the coming and going between.
Thus one nurtures the treasure of the cinnabar field—this treasure ever abides as the pearl within the elixir crucible.
When this pearl returns, it sets the River Chariot in motion,
departing the sea of the coccyx in the dusty world,
relocating to the celestial valley atop Kunlun’s Penglai Isle.

The preceding lines describe the moment of elixir completion, when the embryo sheds its shell to enter the sun;
the final line speaks of the post-accomplishment shedding of the shell;
the two middle lines refer to warming and nurturing the child-pearl, fostering the sacred embryo.

Zhang Sanfeng said:
*"Years, months, days, and hours are but empty markers;
hexagrams, line counts, and weights are but fragmented notions."*

If one grasps the ceaseless, unbroken intent,
this is precisely the moment of "neither forgetting nor forcing."

Bai Ziqing said: *"Vulgar minds with shallow understanding."*
How could the unlearned common folk know that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the celestial and terrestrial immortals daily gather medicinal substances without cease, and that these substances grow ever more abundant with each gathering?
How could they know that the mountains, rivers, and great earth, along with all sentient beings, perpetually refine the fire-times without the slightest interruption, and that this refinement continues without rest?

When spirit congeals, essence and qi gather, and the hundred treasures coalesce—this is the medicinal substance for forming the embryo.
When true breathing flows and returns without the slightest break—this is the fire-time of warming and nurturing.

Chen Xubai said: *"The essence of fire-times must be sought in true breathing."*
Qiu Changchun said: *"A single thought unseparated from the square inch is true emptiness."*
This is the true fire of embryo-nurturing.
For the true fire is none other than one’s own spirit, yet it shares its nature with the spirit of heaven and earth and the spirit of emptiness.
The true fire-time is none other than one’s own breath, yet it shares its rhythm with the breathing of heaven and earth and the breathing of emptiness.

Zuǒ Yuanfang said:
*"Fire-times align with non-doing to merge with the natural;
the natural true fire nurtures the immortal embryo.
Simply abide with spirit and breath within the elixir chamber,
harmonizing precelestial and postcelestial in transformation."*

Wang Chongyang said:
*"Once the sacred embryo has congealed, nurture it with gentle fire.
Settle the spirit and stabilize the breath, allowing all to proceed naturally.
Here, one’s spirit resonates; there, the response arises.
Heavenly mechanism and wondrous function unfold of themselves."*

From this, I know that spirit and breath are the fire-time,
and that what Mencius called "neither forgetting nor forcing,"
what Laozi termed "ceaseless as if existing,"
and what the Buddha described as "neither striving nor slackening"
are all the subtle essence of the natural fire-time of spirit and breath.
Thus it is said:
*"Immortals dare not speak plainly;
to speak plainly would invite ridicule."*

**Zheng Ji: Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life, *The Ten Thousand Spiritual Pointers*, Section Seven – Oral Instructions**
**The Infant Appears, Emerging from the Sea of Suffering**
*(Illustrations: The Infant’s Manifest Form, Emergence from the Sea of Suffering)*
*(Including the Method for Refining Form in True Emptiness)*

When the fire-times are complete and the sacred embryo is fully formed—like fruit ripening or a child coming to term—after ten months, it sheds its womb.
The Buddhists call this the *Dharmakāya*, or the *True Suchness*.
The Daoist tradition calls it the *Red Child*, or the *Infant*.

At the moment of transference, the infant leaps forth, dwelling in seclusion within the qi-cavern, once more opening a primordial chaos.
For this cavern is the original dwelling where immortals nurture the embryo and the red child establishes its life.
Familiar terrain, it returns by the natural path.

Once the infant sits in quietude within the chamber, abiding in the sacred precinct, it must be concealed in profound mystery and guarded in silent stillness.
At first, it relies on the Yellow Sprout of the Earth Mother for nourishment;
later, it gathers the vital intent of heaven and earth to feed upon.
Here, aspiration meets response; near and far become one.
Within, it breathes of itself, opens and closes of itself, moves and stills of itself—utterly free and at ease,
like an immortal roaming the Land of No-Where,
or a Tathāgata in samādhi upon the Sea of Extinction.

At this place of great peace and bliss, one must still guard the Pass of Origin in secrecy,
lest the six sense-desires and demonic thieves of the external world invade,
or internal afflictions and treacherous ministers stir chaos.
Whether sitting or lying down, one must constantly apply the work of luminous purity.
At times pausing, at times proceeding, one broadly exerts the power of cultivation.
Thus the six gates remain unbreached, the single path ever open,
the true body abiding in suchness, the foundation of the elixir eternally secure.

Day and night, one must protect and tend to it thus—
like a dragon guarding its pearl, like a mother nurturing her child—
without the slightest lapse of mindfulness, without a single moment of lost awareness.

Master Zhongli said:
*"The child is young and not yet grown;
it depends on the Earth Mother’s nurturing grace."*
And again:
*"Having realized the effortless, self-so heart,
one must still nurture and preserve the true."*

Li Qing’an said:
*"The elixir is refined within the unrefined;
the Dao is enacted within non-enactment.
Cease thoughts, sever attachments, regulate the ancestral qi,
forget perception, forget sight—nurture the infant."*

Lü Chunyang said:
*"The infant within the abdomen is now fully formed,
yet for a time it lingers in the dusty world to savor its joy.
How foolish the pedant who prattles on,
only to retreat into the depths of white clouds."*

For the nurturing of the infant is a great affair in the making of an immortal.
If nurturing is improper, the infant may abandon its shell and leave its nest.
At this time, one must be vigilant, never allowing it to wander forth carelessly—
for once it departs, it may lose its way, and the dwelling will be left without return.
Thus Bai Yuchan lamented the need to *"reassemble the fishing rod"* and *"re-carve the autumn bamboo."*

Master Shangyang said:
*"Having reached the returning of nine and seven,
this is the unity of wood, metal, three, and five."*

When qi is complete and spirit robust at the time of womb-transformation,
guard the infant closely and never let it stray afar.
The secret of protection lies in tightly securing the Three Essentials.
The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—
seal them shut, let no passage open.
The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
floating and roaming yet abiding within the compass."*
This method entails: with the eye observe the eye,
with the ear listen to the ear,
with the nose regulate the nose,
with the mouth seal the mouth.
Conceal all leaping and soaring within the singular true mind.
Thus, externally, there is no entanglement by sound, form, scent, or taste;
internally, no burden of intention, fixation, obstinacy, or self.
Naturally, the square inch of the heart becomes empty and luminous,
all conditions settle into stillness,
and one’s original infant abides joyfully within.

Though the Three Essentials are externally secured,
it is even more vital to internally dispel the Three Harms.
The Three Harms are: wayward thoughts, afflictions, and wrath.
Thus, Chan Master Daojue said:
*"Cultivate this precept, concentration, and wisdom,
to sever that greed, desire, and delusion."*
For greed and delusion are easily subdued,
but the venom of wrath is difficult to quell.
The *Secret of the Sacred Embryo* states:
*"When the fire of wrath ignites,
the true embryo flees like a galloping horse.
Only when the fire subsides and smoke dissipates
does it return to its dwelling."*
The Song Confucians also said:
*"If the fire of anger is not curbed,
it will surely bring the calamity of a prairie ablaze.
If the water of desire is not dammed,
how can there be no disaster of a bursting river?"*
The *Ritual of Cultivation and Realization in the Round Awakening Dao-Chang* states:
*"A single thought of wrath arises,
and the eight directions become gates of obstruction."*
To dispel wrath, one must follow Laozi’s *"daily diminution,"*
the *Zhouyi*’s *"curbing anger,"*
and the World-Honored One’s *"awakened illumination."*
The eminent monk Miaopu said:
*"When the fire of wrath burns,
I illuminate it with awareness.
Like hot water melting ice,
it dissolves without distinction."*
For this fire of wrath has no substantial form—
it arises from the nameless.
As the *Ratnakūṭa Sūtra* verse says:
*"Like fire struck from wood,
it requires the power of many conditions.
If conditions do not converge,
fire will never arise."*
*"It arises from displeasure,
yet ultimately has no existence.
Knowing the emptiness of sound’s nature,
wrath no longer arises."*
Wrath does not reside in sound,
nor does it dwell within the body.
It arises from the convergence of conditions;
without conditions, it does not arise.
*"Like ghee and curds formed from milk and other conditions,
wrath’s nature does not arise inherently,
but from coarse and foul circumstances.
The foolish, failing to understand,
are scorched by their own burning affliction.
One should know thus:
ultimately, it has no existence.
Wrath’s nature is fundamentally quiescent—
only a provisional name exists.
Wrath and actuality are one.
Dependent on true thusness,
knowing it as the dharma-realm,
this is called the samādhi of wrath."*
The *Ratnakūṭa Sūtra* further states:
*"Seek the wisdom of spontaneity to shatter the shell of the nameless,
and the nameless transforms into a torch of wisdom,
while the fire of wrath becomes the lamp of the mind.
Once the poison of wrath is dissolved,
the eighty-four thousand afflictions are extinguished."*
The Buddhist scriptures say:
*"All demons are equal,
but afflictions come first."*
And:
*"The demon residing in the bodhisattva
has no existence in afflictions."*
The text states:
*"The wise, amid suffering and joy,
remain unmoved like empty space.
Skillfully observing afflictions,
they are free from self and what belongs to self."*
And:
*"With unobstructed great compassion,
observing all sentient beings,
all their afflictions arise from false and deluded thoughts.
Knowing the nature of afflictions,
they are inherently apart.
Thus, awakening to this
is bodhi."*
*"The nature of afflictions
is the nature of bodhi."*
And:
*"The realm of afflictions is the Buddha’s realm;
observing the emptiness of afflictions’ nature is true cultivation."*
And:
*"To eliminate afflictions,
practice right mindfulness."*
The Fourth Patriarch also said:
*"All afflictions and karmic hindrances
are fundamentally empty and quiescent."*
Surveying the essential purport of the Buddha and patriarchs’ scriptures,
one sees that the nature of afflictions is empty—do not let it obstruct.
Observe them as dreams and illusions,
and do not take them to heart.
If stirred by circumstances,
respond like an echo—
once the response ceases, it ends.
Thus, the dust of afflictions and toil
vanishes without need for severance,
and the true embryo and original infant
become numinous without need for cultivation.

Another scripture says:
*"With the sword of wisdom, slay the thief of afflictions;
with the blade of wisdom, sever the net of afflictions;
with the fire of wisdom, burn the kindling of afflictions."*
Monk Yuan Zhao said:
*"Confronting the demon of afflictions,
one abides in purity and constant joy."*
Layman Pang said:
*"Seeing clearly the four great elements as fundamentally empty,
where can afflictions find a foothold?"*
Chao Wenyuan said:
*"The body is like a dream or illusion, not truly existent;
affairs are like wind and clouds, not long abiding.
Once you thoroughly comprehend, resolutely sever them—
the demon of afflictions vanishes as soon as it passes."*
Zhang Ziyang said:
*"One may say the Dao is lofty and dragons and tigers submit,
or that virtue is weighty and ghosts and spirits drink.
Already knowing longevity equals heaven and earth,
how could afflictions ever again arise in the heart?"*
The *Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch* states:
*"The ordinary person is the Buddha;
afflictions are bodhi.
The former thought deluded is the ordinary person;
the latter thought awakened is the Buddha.
The former thought attached to realms is affliction;
the latter thought detached from realms is bodhi."*
Thus, the *Yingluo Jing* says:
*"The Buddha said: From the beginning, I have never attained a single dharma.
Only when the mind is ultimately settled
does one realize what is called ‘no-thought.’
If one attains no-thought,
observing all dharmas as utterly formless,
one thereby achieves the unsurpassed true and correct Way."*
And:
*"That worldly people cannot achieve the Dao and escape birth and death
is truly due to deluded thoughts as the seeds of saṃsāra.
Where deluded thoughts arise,
disaster is born.
Where deluded thoughts cease,
true origin resides."*
Thus, the Daoist gate takes *"stopping thoughts"* as its foundation,
while the Buddhist teaching takes *"no-thought"* as its principle.
*"No-thought"* means no perverse thoughts,
not the absence of right thoughts.
Thinking of existence or non-existence is called perverse thought;
not thinking of existence or non-existence is called right thought.
Thinking of good or evil is called perverse thought;
not thinking of good or evil is called right thought.
Even suffering and joy, arising and ceasing, grasping and relinquishing,
enmity and kinship, hatred and love—
all are called perverse thoughts.
Not thinking of suffering and joy, and so forth, is called right thought.
Simply put: when affairs arise, do not accept them in any way—
non-mind is no-thought."

The thought of no-thought is called right thought. As the Buddhist sutra states: *"Good sons, we dwell in the Dharma of no-thought and thereby attain the thirty-two golden marks, radiating great light that illumines all worlds without exception."* High Peak Chan Master said: *"Maitreya’s vow to attain Buddhahood in one lifetime arises from the single thought of the unborn nature-ocean."* Wisdom-Constant Chan Master said: *"True Suchness is no-thought. No thought of dharmas can approach true reality; how could the unborn give rise to mind? One who attains the thought of no-thought thinks True Suchness; one who gives birth to the unborn gives birth to true reality."* Li Zhicai said: *"Thought aligned with Heavenly Principle is like the bright moon in the sky; thought bound by human desire is like floating clouds obscuring the sun."* Han Shanzi said: *"Revolving the dry and overturning the peaks, the mind abides in stillness—one thought endures for ten thousand years without shifting."* Tianyinzi said: *"Without seeing or hearing, preserve awakened nature; without thinking or thought, nurture the immortal embryo."*

In the *Ratnakūṭa Sūtra*, the bodhisattva abides in the thought of non-abiding, neither recollecting nor forgetting—this is called the Dharma Realm. Thus, from ancient times, whether Buddhas, patriarchs, sages, or immortals, all attained the wondrous Dao by darkening the mind and stilling thoughts. As the *Book of Documents* states: *"Only the mad can focus thought to become sages."* Yet the work of focusing thought must be personally practiced and realized to make progress. Otherwise, the vast emptiness stretches far, and missing even one step means never arriving. As the ancients said: *"Without sufficient effort, nothing becomes round or square; when effort is perfected, one naturally enters no-thought."* Having attained the true constancy of no-thought, the mysterious aperture and infant are utterly still, free from all disturbance.

Liu Xugu said: *"Great achievement requires three thousand days; wondrous function remains unbroken through the twelve hours."* Chen Chaoyuan said: *"Nurturing the embryo takes ten months; raising the infant with milk and care demands a thousand mornings."* Mud-Womb Elder said: *"A moment’s effort brings immediate results, but mastery requires three years."* When three years of effort are complete and the work of nurturing is finished, one awakens to the truth: *"In a flash of flame, the true person appears."* Once the true person appears, they must emerge from the Supreme Mystery and ascend to the Celestial Valley. With further effort to darken the mind and extinguish all, the wondrous power of spiritual transformation arises.

Liu Haichan said:
*"When the fire of the hexagrams completes its celestial cycle,
An infant is conceived, settled in the lower field.
With a thunderous roar rising from the earth,
A thousand doors open, and light shines for ten thousand miles.
Turning the body, one pushes through the Gate of the Supreme Mystery—
Only then is one truly a child of the immortals."*

**True Emptiness Refining the Form (Illustration of True Emptiness Refining the Form)**
Puzhao Foxin said: *"Heretics boast of their white self-contemplation, yet sigh that people coil within jars."*

The Supreme Vehicle is profound and far-reaching,
Best sought through the Mysterious Aperture to find the boundless heavens.

The method of refining the form through True Emptiness
Is like moving a jar.
If one remains inside the jar, how can it be moved?
One must stand outside it.
To stand outside the jar is what the Buddha meant by "externalizing the body and embracing emptiness."

Thus Laozi said:
*"Externalize the body, and the body is perfected;
Forget the form, and the form endures."*

Xue Daoguang said:
*"If one empties this illusory body,
The true precepts of the sacred master are personally transmitted."*

Zhang Quanyi said:
*"The Great Void is myself—first empty the body.
Once the body is empty, heaven and earth are also empty.
When heaven and earth are empty, the Great Void is also empty.
Emptying even emptiness—this is True Emptiness."*

The *Classic of Purity* states:
*"Inwardly observe the heart—there is no heart.
Outwardly perceive the form—there is no form.
When the form has no form, the body is empty;
When the heart has no heart, the mind is empty.
With the mind empty and unimpeded, the spirit refines and grows ever more numinous;
With the body empty and unimpeded, the form refines and grows ever more pure.
Only when refining reaches the point where form and spirit mutually contain each other,
Where body and mind become one,
Is one truly in the wondrous state of form and spirit,
In perfect union with the Dao."*

An ancient immortal said:
*"The form is preserved through the Dao,
The life extended through the art.
This art is the boundless primordial qi,
Which sustains the limited bodily frame.
The boundless primordial qi is the true essence of heaven and earth,
The eternal generative power of yin and yang,
The sacred father and holy mother of life.
The limited bodily frame is the coarse and turbid qi of ordinary parents,
Brief and disordered.
Thus, by transforming the body of ordinary parents with the true qi of the sacred parents,
One becomes a being of pure yang essence,
And attains the same lifespan as heaven and earth."*

According to the Venerable Sundara:
*"The World-Honored One taught me to contemplate the whiteness at the tip of the nose.
At first, I observed it carefully for twenty-one days,
And saw the breath entering and leaving like smoke.
Within, the body and mind became luminous,
The world transparent and utterly pure,
Like crystal.
The smoky appearance gradually dissolved,
The breath at the nostrils turned white,
The mind opened, and the outflows ceased.
All incoming and outgoing breaths transformed into radiant light,
Illuminating the ten directions.
Thus I attained arhatship."*

Zhu Yuanhui said:
*"At the tip of the nose, there is whiteness—I observe it."*

Mo Renzhen said:
*"All my life, I loved elegance and grace,
Often laughing at those who sought outwardly.
In a thousand differences, no trace could be found—
Yet it was always there, at the tip of the nose."*

Before a person is born,
Each inhalation and exhalation connects with the mother.
After birth,
Each inhalation and exhalation connects with heaven.
Heaven and humanity share the same qi,
Linked and flowing,
Mutually inhaling and exhaling,
Like the pull of a saw.
Heaven gives to me—
If I can absorb its qi, the qi flourishes and life begins.
Heaven gives to heaven—
If I lose its qi, the qi is cut off and death follows.

Thus the sage observes the way of heaven,
Grasps the movement of heaven,
And at the critical moment before the sun rises over the valley,
Sits in stillness, gathering the spirit,
Empties the self to await it,
Inwardly holding intent,
Outwardly releasing all entanglements,
Instantly forgetting heaven and earth,
Shattering the bodily form.
Naturally, within the Great Void,
A single point of yang—like dew, like lightning—
Vibrantly enters the Mysterious Gate,
Pierces the Celestial Valley,
Ascends to the Mud Pill Palace,
Transforms into sweet dew,
And descends into the five viscera.
I then stir the wind of Xun to respond,
Driving out the evil from the Three Passes and Nine Apertures,
Sweeping away the filth from the five organs and six bowels,
Burning the body and refining the substance,
Forging the dross and dispelling the haze,
Drawing out the impure and turbid frame,
Transforming it into a body of pure yang.
With long and patient accumulation,
The form is transmuted into that of an immortal.

Chen Cuixu said:
*"The golden light permeates the body, the marrow fragrant,
Golden sinews and jade bones—all pure yang.
Refining until the red blood flows white,
The yin qi dissolves, and the body is naturally sound."*

Qiu Changchun said:
*"If only one can always attend to each breath,
The bodily frame is exchanged, and jade-like fluid flows."*

Zhang Ziqiong said:
*"Heaven and humanity share the same qi from the beginning,
But the bodily form obstructs their union.
Only when refining reaches the point where form and spirit merge in darkness
Does one realize that form is itself True Emptiness."*

Xue Fuming said:
*"Not knowing what to call it 'qi,'
After attainment, it is naturally real."*

Dong Hanchun said:
*"Gold is refined by consuming ore,
The form is forged by refining qi."*

The methods of refining the form number six in total:
The first is refining the form with Jade Fluid,
The second with Golden Fluid,
The third with the Great Yin,
The fourth with the Great Yang,
The fifth with Inner Observation.
Yet none of these, being not the Great Dao of Emptiness,
Can ultimately unite with the Great Void.
Only this one secret—
Refining the form through True Emptiness—
Though called "action," is truly non-action;
Though called "refining the form," is truly refining the spirit.
It is cultivation of the external while also cultivating the internal.
Following this method in practice,
After a hundred days, the seven poisons vanish,
The Three Corpses disappear,
The Six Thieves hide away,
And the Ten Demons flee far off.
After a thousand days of refinement,
The Four Great Elements of the body
Become like a crystal tower,
Exquisitely transparent inside and out,
The heart’s flower radiant,
The numinous light manifest.
This numinous light is the light of wisdom,
Thus it is said: *"Where the light of awareness arises, the flower of awakening blooms."*
For the flower of wisdom to bloom,
One must refine the form to the subtlest level,
And merge with the Dao in darkness.
Thus the *Scripture of Spirit Generation* states:
*"When body and spirit unite as one, it is the true body;
When body and spirit merge, the form follows the Dao in communion.
In concealment, the form is stabilized by the spirit;
In manifestation, the spirit unites with qi.
Thus one treads water and fire without hindrance,
Faces the sun and moon without shadow.
My dissolution lies within myself,
Entering and exiting without obstruction.
One may leave the form to abide in the world,
Or shed the body to ascend as an immortal.
Some ascend bodily in broad daylight—
This is the way of the Yellow Emperor.
Some leave the form in the world—
This is the way of Peng Zu."*

Some are ordained to fulfill heavenly duties—this is the way of Celestial Master Zhang.
Some ascend with their entire households—this is the way of Xu Shiyang.
Some feign illness and depart—this is the way of Wang Chongyang.
Some enter officialdom as ministers—this is the way of Dongfang Shuo.

As for Laozi serving as the Keeper of Archives,
Xin Gan as a grandee,
Yin Xi as the Keeper of the Pass,
Bo Ji as a high minister,
Tang Dian retiring to Kunling,
Jie Xiu governing Qiyuan,
Four emperors taking them as teachers,
Hao assisting Emperor Hui of Han,
Qiu Sheng serving Yin,
Fu Guang serving Han,
Ma Zhou serving Jin,
Hai Chan serving Yan,
Zhengyang abandoning office,
Chunyang sitting for examinations,
Chang You holding the whip,
Qin Gao bearing the tablet—
such examples are too numerous to count.

Alas! The concealment, manifestation, departure, and abiding of immortals—how could worldly mortals ever fathom them?

Moreover, those who ride the void and command the wind like Liezi,
or cross rivers by bending reeds,
or like Bodhidharma, who refined form through washing away impurities—
how could they achieve such effortless ascension without mastery of both form and spirit?
This is the Way of perfecting both form and spirit, beyond the grasp of those who merely sit in dissolution or stand in death.

Thus, those among the followers of immortals and Buddhas who focus solely on refining the spirit, neglecting the refinement of form, are but ethereal, well-transformed ghosts—how can they compare to lofty immortals?

Generally, the nurturing and refinement of form knows no division between self and other. Though expounded in two distinct paths, they are in truth one and the same. Inner and outer cultivation proceed without contradiction. If one’s practice remains uninterrupted for ten days, it is the moment of letting go at the cliff’s edge—naturally, words fail, thoughts cease, subject and object dissolve, form and emptiness vanish. Unobstructed and unstained, the body soars like a wild swan beyond all cages, the mind rests like a lotus untouched by water. Radiant and pure, free and unburdened, one moves with effortless spontaneity—spontaneity in motion, motion in spontaneity—becoming a carefree wanderer, at ease and unbound.

At this stage, the infant gradually takes form, indistinguishable from a mortal. Yet one must still conceal its brilliance and hide its radiance, steadfastly calming the heart’s field. Should joy arise, it risks expanding into boundless realms. As Chen Niuwan said:
*"In my first year of practice, the six pulses stilled and qi returned to the root.
An infant dwelled within my cinnabar field, its form mirroring my own."*

Once the infant matures and the cavity can no longer contain it, it naturally bursts forth, piercing the crown and ascending. This is what it means to escape the sea of suffering and rise to the other shore. As Chan Master Yongming Yanshou said:
*"Within the sea of suffering, I relied on this iron arhat.
Once freed from the sea of suffering, I abandoned the raft to reach the other shore."*

And as Master Chen the True One observed:
*"Having left the waves of this shore, only then does one know longevity is attainable.
Once attained, it should be forever preserved—
the raft that crossed the river becomes the ladder to heaven."*

**Oral Instructions of the Eighth Section of the *Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life, the Jade Pivot of the Ten Thousand Spirits***
*Moving the Spirit to the Inner Court, Upright and Serene in Dark Meditation*
*(Illustrations: Upright and Serene in Dark Meditation, Transformation of the Five Bodies into Five, Mounting the Phoenix to Soar the Empyrean, Manifestation of the Yang Spirit)*

At first, one acts with purpose—gathering medicine and congealing the elixir to complete the mandate of life.
In the end, one acts without purpose—embracing oneness and darkening the heart to complete the nature.

As the *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"At first, purposeful action stirs the crowd’s notice;
only at the stage of non-action do they begin to understand.
Yet they see only non-action as the Dao’s wonder,
unaware that purposeful action is the root."*

The *Song of Realizing the Dao* says:
*"Only when non-action is not mere non-action
does one know the Dao is profound and subtle."*

Today’s mundane mortals, renunciates, and external cultivators know only this side of the truth, unaware of that other realm. They grasp only the wonders of this shore, ignorant of the mysteries of the far shore. They know only the state of "no affairs," yet not the rare affairs; they know only non-action, yet not the methods of action. This is knowing one but not the other—cultivating nature without cultivating life.

Before the elixir is complete, if one clings to emptiness without understanding the purposeful action of foundational practice, one becomes a "fallen-into-emptiness fellow." After the elixir is complete, if one clings to appearances without understanding the non-action of transcendent attainment, one becomes a "corpse-guarding ghost."

As Shi Xinglin said:
*"There is something, yet not nothing;
non-action harmonizes with action."*

Chen Niuwan said:
*"I have heard the sages of former times:
within non-action, nothing is not done."*

Yin Changsheng said:
*"The true person dwells in the upper realm, where emptiness and stillness know no dust to obstruct.
When the work of action is complete, it returns to non-action—
yet even in non-action, there is skillful effort."*

The "true person dwelling in the upper realm" refers to the time when the infant escapes the sea of suffering and moves to the Heavenly Valley. "Emptiness and stillness, darkening the heart" refers to Lüzu’s method of retiring at dusk to still the true heart and merge with the Dao.

As Shi Jianwu said:
*"Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years before transcending the inner court of the World-Honored One.
Six years of darkening the heart were needed to escape the cage."*

To darken the heart is to dwell in seclusion, sit upright in silence, unstained by a single speck of dust, all thoughts forgotten. Without thought, without action, one moves with spontaneous ease. Without seeing, without hearing, one embraces the spirit in stillness. Without inner or outer, without grasping or responding, beyond form and emptiness, beyond delusion and falsehood, the body embodies emptiness and stillness, ever aware, ever luminous. By darkening this heart, the myriad dharmas return to one—then the infant abides in the realm of purity and spirit, rests in the field of immovability. Form cannot obstruct it, emptiness cannot bind it. The body is like empty space, serene and free.

Thus Chan Master Daguan said:
*"Form does not bind, emptiness does not obstruct—
with breath stilled and heart darkened, one beholds self-mastery.
The ten thousand existences return to nothingness,
yet when the world dissolves, it remains unharmed."*

Master Tan Changzhen said:
*"The infant shifts to the upper elixir field,
upright and reverent, the darkened heart merges with nature.
When three thousand merits of practice are complete,
one may ascend as immortal or attain Buddhahood at will."*

Here lies the work of absolute purity, undiluted—how could the slightest thought or desire arise? Yet if one harbors even the faintest wish for immortality or Buddhahood, one remains trapped in the very snare of life and death. Thus Master Guanyin said: *"To loathe life and death, or to seek liberation from them, is but demonic delusion—not the Dao."*

Within the clarity of stillness, the body is vast and empty, radiant and boundless, possessing nothing, clinging to nothing. As the *Heart Essentials* states:
*"Darkening the heart begins with no abiding, no dwelling;
abiding in the heart reveals a boundless, unfathomable sphere."*

As the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: *"One should not abide in form to give rise to the mind, nor in sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharmas—one should give rise to a mind that abides nowhere."* Vajracchedika Bodhisattva declared: *"I do not abide in existence to abide, nor in non-abiding to abide—I abide thus."* Sengzhao wrote: *"The sage’s heart abides in non-abiding; such abiding is forgetting both self and surroundings."* A treatise states: *"Not relying on any dharma, the mind remains eternally abiding."* The *Heart Sūtra of Understanding Mind* says: *"The mind abides nowhere; abiding is without mind. Free from attachment, non-abiding transforms into truth."* The *Vimalakīrti Sūtra* teaches: *"All dharmas take non-abiding as their root. To dwell in non-action is called abiding; abiding without fixed place is called non-abiding. The non-abiding mind is the true mind."*

The *Collected Chan Sources* states: *"The word ‘mind’ is the mind’s name; the word ‘knowing’ is the mind’s essence."* Master Heze said: *"The mind’s essence is knowing; knowing is the mind. The mind is fundamentally empty and still, utterly void and numinous. Knowing arises from this emptiness, stillness, voidness, and numinosity—this is primordial knowing. Awakening arises from it—this is primordial awakening. Awakening without deliberation is called true awakening; knowing without thought is called true knowing."* Thus the ancestral masters said: *"Within the empty and still essence, inherent wisdom arises to know—this very knowing of emptiness and stillness is the pure mind transmitted by Bodhidharma."*

The mind’s constant stillness is the nature’s essence; the mind’s constant knowing is the nature’s function. As the Sixth Patriarch said: *"All myriad dharmas do not depart from self-nature. Self-nature knows itself, sees itself, awakens itself, and liberates itself."* Awakening to nature is easy; understanding the mind is difficult. To understand the mind is to understand *this* mind. When the mind is understood, the mind is no longer the mind. The mind without mind is called the true mind. The true mind is nature; true nature is the mind.

The *Most High* said: *"Understanding the mind reveals true nature; understanding nature reveals the true mind. In the emptiness of no-emptiness, nowhere is the true realized."* This is called *"true emptiness is not empty"*—emptiness without emptiness is the realization of the original mind. Layman Pang said:
*"The ten directions gather as one,
each learning non-action.
This is the field where buddhas are chosen—
with mind empty, one passes and returns."*

When emptiness reaches its utmost roundness and the emptiness of emptiness is extinguished, this is the realization of original nature. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: *"Dharmatā is fundamentally empty and still, without grasping or seeing. Emptiness of nature is the Buddha—beyond the reach of thought."*

Originally, the nature’s essence is empty, the mind’s essence is quiescent. Without emptiness, without non-emptiness, it is called *"ultimate emptiness."* Without quiescence, without non-quiescence, it is called *"true quiescence."* Though cultivating emptiness, one does not take emptiness as proof, nor entertain thoughts of emptiness—this is true emptiness. Though attaining quiescence, one does not take quiescence as proof, nor entertain thoughts of quiescence—this is true quiescence. When emptiness and quiescence reach perfect balance, one penetrates all barriers. Suddenly, the celestial mechanism is revealed, wisdom and nature become luminous—like a lotus blossoming, or waking from a dream. In an instant, a natural realm manifests, filling heaven and earth with inexhaustible treasury.

This is the mind-nature’s constant radiance, luminous and unwavering, illuminating the cosmos, penetrating past and present, transforming without limit, divinely subtle and unfathomable. Though endowed with fleshly eyes, one opens the light of the wisdom eye—not by exchanging the ordinary mind for the Buddha-mind’s knowing and seeing, but by seeing nature to its utmost clarity, cultivating practice to its most profound depth. Thus, the nature becomes perfectly bright, and the six penetrations are instantly complete.

What are the six penetrations? As Master Yuyang said:
*"When sitting in stillness, the heart’s light suddenly appears—within, one sees the viscera; without, one perceives one’s own brows. Wisdom and spirit leap forth, words flow endlessly, expounding the wondrous and discussing the profound without limit—this is the penetration of mind and realm.*
*Without leaving one’s dwelling, one foresees future events. Though seated indoors, one sees through walls—this is the penetration of divine power.*
*In meditation, one suddenly falls into confusion, indistinct and undifferentiated. After a moment, the heart’s aperture opens wide, and mountains and rivers appear as if viewed on the palm—this is the penetration of the celestial eye.*
*One hears sounds from the ten directions as if they were at one’s ear; one recalls past lives as if they were present—this is the penetration of the celestial ear.*
*Day or night, entering deep samādhi, one sees heaven above and hell below, perceiving countless kalpas of past lives—this is the penetration of past lives.*
*With divine transformations, appearing and disappearing at will, one perceives the hidden and subtle within the hearts of beings in the ten directions. Though their thoughts have not yet arisen, one knows them clearly; though their intentions have not yet formed, one awakens to them—this is the penetration of others’ minds."*

Zisi said: *"The spirit of the heart is called sageliness."* Thus, when the heart is quiescent, it becomes wise; when still, it becomes responsive; when tranquil, it knows; when empty, it becomes numinous; when sincere, it becomes bright; when void, it awakens. The Fourth Patriarch Daoxin said: *"All divine powers and functions are manifestations of the self-mind."*

The *Yingluo Sutra* states: *"Spirit is named the celestial heart; penetration is named wisdom-nature."* The natural wisdom illumines without attainment—thus it is called divine penetration. When divine penetration is fully realized, one’s radiance becomes ever more silent and resplendent, concealing the light of wisdom without employing it. Should one reveal its edges like the tip of a jade scepter, one risks attracting demonic influences. As the ancients said: *"When the Dao rises a foot, demons rise ten."* During true concentration, one may hear all manner of good and evil sounds or encounter various adverse and favorable circumstances—all are demonic obstructions. Do not cling to them. Instead, turn inward to observe the body: the four great elements are all provisional, coalescing like dreams and illusions, wholly unreal. Rest solely in this heart, and demons will vanish of themselves. As the old saying goes: *"See the strange and not be strange—strangeness will perish; see the demon and not be demon—demons will dissolve."*

At times, one may hear thunderclaps within the brain, see golden stars glittering in the eyes, or behold red clouds swirling below the crown of the head, or a radiant orb emerging between the brows—all are illusory visions. Do not accept them; simply continue your practice without seeking verification. Thus, the ancient immortals said: *"Light beneath the neck is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet do not make one an immortal."* In stillness, one may suddenly perceive towers adorned with pearls and jade, celestial maidens playing flutes and zithers, rare grasses and wondrous flowers—all vivid as paintings. If one fails to awaken, one may mistake this for arrival in a heavenly palace, not recognizing it as the inner court of one’s own being, taking the illusory for reality and lingering without escape. At such moments, one must employ the *Observation of Emptiness* to expand it: let the spirit of the celestial valley ascend into the Great Void and merge as one.

This *Observation of Emptiness* begins with observing the self-mind. The mind is fundamentally unborn; its nature is inherently perfected, originally empty and still, its luminosity pervading all—like the void, clear and boundless, pure and vast, perfectly round and bright as the great moon, equal in measure to the empty sky, vast and without limit. Next, observe the body: the emptiness of the mind connects to the emptiness of the body, the emptiness of the body connects to the emptiness of heaven and earth, and the emptiness of heaven and earth connects to the emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate. Emptiness interpenetrates emptiness, forming a single expanse—how could it not merge with the Great Void as one?

First, empty the heart; then, empty the body; next, empty heaven and earth. Empty yet not empty, non-empty yet empty—emptiness is unknown, non-emptiness is unknown. Then the yang spirit soars through the void, entering and exiting without obstruction. Only then can one unite virtue with heaven and earth, merge essence with the Great Void, and become a person of the *Hunxu* clan. This is but the threshold to the Great Void, not yet its true realization. It may be called *"refining the spirit,"* but not yet *"exiting the spirit."*

To ascend to the imperial realm, one must refine and nurture the spirit of the valley, constantly maintaining spiritual harmony and tranquil illumination. Let the heart be empty like space, without clinging; embrace the root and return to the origin, merging with the Supreme Ultimate. Progressing thus without cease, when there is no higher to ascend, profound beyond profundity, without image to image, spontaneously and naturally, the wondrous existence of the single spirit pervades the Dharma Realm, penetrating the Milky Way, ascending to unite with the boundless heavens—this is the ultimate and most wondrous refinement of the primordial spirit of the celestial valley.

Thus, Zhang Silian said: *"Attain the whole of the Supreme Ultimate, see the original face: the precelestial true one point, the postcelestial is but a dwelling."* Yingchanzi said: *"Refine the yang spirit to its completion, then exit the yang spirit—transcend the realm of form to enter the formless realm."* Having realized the wondrous Dao, one must blend with the world while preserving one’s light. Though dwelling in the mundane, one does not flow with vulgarity; though abiding in a defiled age, one’s conduct remains inscrutable. Daily, one conceals and accumulates hidden merits, opens the sincere heart, bestows the milk of the Dharma, guides later learners, and universally liberates sentient beings—repaying the Buddha’s grace above and aiding all beings below.

The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: *"All sentient beings—whether born from eggs, wombs, moisture, or transformation; whether with form, without form, with thought, without thought, or neither with nor without thought—I will lead them all into the unconditioned nirvāṇa and liberate them. Thus liberating measureless, countless, boundless beings, yet truly no being is liberated."* Therefore, when the World-Honored One attained the Dao, he first aroused the compassion to universally liberate beings, declaring: *"First liberate sentient beings, then become a Buddha."*

Master Zhao said: *"Nature is fundamentally unborn, thus also without extinction—this is the true heart shared by all sages. Only when all beings are liberated does one enter nirvāṇa—this is the ultimate realization shared by all sages."* Wang Fangping said:
*"When phoenixes and cranes arrive riding purple mist,
The Jade Emperor’s decree opens the immortal’s path.
Ninefold ancestors and sevenfold kin all ascend to heaven—
Only when all beings are liberated does one liberate oneself."*

Alas! Observe how the ancient buddhas and lofty immortals extended their hearts so universally. Nowadays, those who possess a single method or secret formula guard it closely, fearing its revelation. Compared to the ancients, can they not die of shame?

I have long been without thought, yet unable to liberate myself, I first seek to liberate others. This lingering intention cannot be released. In this work, I have revealed all celestial secrets—save for the final step, which remains unspoken. Now, I shall say more:

The Daoist texts state: *"The yin spirit can see others; the yang spirit allows others to see it."* Those who cultivate only one aspect produce a yin spirit—one with shadow but no form, what the world calls a *ghost immortal*. Those who cultivate both nature and life produce a yang spirit—one with both shadow and form, what the world calls a *celestial immortal*. Thus it is said: *"The Dao is originally without form; the immortal values having form."* Yet exiting the spirit too soon is sternly admonished in the alchemical classics. Once attained, the mother must return to the origin.

Ever abide in the Celestial Valley, returning to the state of an infant—knowing nothing, perceiving nothing, profound only in stillness. With the yang radiance unscattered, it expands ever further, its light reaching ever farther. Naturally, it transforms and gives birth to spirit. Birth upon birth yields endless generation; transformation upon transformation yields boundless metamorphosis, begetting descendants by the hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions.

Zhang Ziyang said: *"In one year, a child is born—each and every one rides a crane."* Chen Niuwan said: *"In one year, a womb bears a child; the child begets grandchildren, and grandchildren branch forth."* Bai Yuchan said: *"One body pervades the many like the bright moon, its reflections dividing across a thousand waters—one body in a single mirror, its light dwelling in ten thousand forms."*

Daoists call this *dividing the body*; Buddhists call it *manifesting transformation bodies*. Like the World-Honored One, who never left the Bodhi tree yet ascended to the heavenly palaces to expound the Dharma. Or like Sudhana, who never departed the Śāla grove yet traversed two hundred and ten cities to visit all his spiritual friends.

The Lord of Eastern Florescence said: *"The Dharma-body is vast, penetrating heaven and earth; true nature is perfectly luminous, pervading past and present. If the crown aperture has not opened and the eye of wisdom is not yet complete, do not disperse your shadow or divide your form."* For though dividing form and dispersing shadow are wondrous, they remain bound within the illusory body, still unliberated. How can one seek myriad transformations without harming the original essence?

Only when nine years of practice are complete should one not abruptly leap beyond the Five Phases and return to the primordial state of Non-Ultimate. Realizing the wondrous truth of true suchness, one perfects true attainment and fully attains the indestructible vajra-body, becoming a person who never dies for ten thousand years. Awakening oneself and awakening others, one upholds the Buddha-seed until the three thousand merits are fulfilled—then white cranes come to welcome, eight hundred virtues are perfected, and a divine edict is proclaimed, summoning one to ascend the Golden Pavilion and return to the imperial homeland.

As Elder Zhongli said: *"When nine years of practice are complete and worldly affairs are exhausted, one roams heaven and earth without constraint."* Xiao Zixu said: *"When practice is complete, one must exit through the spiritual meridian; the inner court’s splendor no longer burdens the body. Learn the ancient immortals’ method of liberation—soaring on a crane, gazing upon the Three Clarities."*

The shedding of the mortal husk varies among immortals: some emerge from a jeweled pagoda, some from a crimson tower; some depart while gazing at the moon, some while facing a mirror; some burst forth from the crown aperture. Thus, the *Profound Mysteries Collection* states: *"Seal the path to the Yellow Springs, break open the gate of the Purple Palace. How did Master Haichan transform into a crane and emerge from the mud-pill?"* The *Harmonious Union Collection* says: *"When the crown aperture opens, a new heaven and earth unfold within. Yet how easily is this aperture opened? First, the fire of samādhi is kindled to penetrate it—no success. Next, the fire of the Great Sun is gathered to strike it—slight movement. The two fires blaze fiercely, ceaselessly assaulting it. In an instant, red light fills the world, purple flames pervade the sky, and with a thunderous crack—the crown aperture opens!"*

Thus, Lü Chunyang said: *"After nine years of unbroken fire-phase, suddenly the Heavenly Gate shatters at the crown. The True Person appears, wielding great spiritual powers—from this moment, celestial immortals may offer their congratulations."* When the True Person emerges, they ride the clouds, mount flying dragons, ascend the Jade Capital, and wander the celestial palaces, drifting among the clouds and soaring through the vastness of space. With phoenix-script golden writs, they attend the court of the Nine Suns; with peach nectar and jade liquor, they take their seat at the banquet of the Ten Thousand Sages. When they wish to go, a simurgh-drawn chariot leads the way; when they ascend the clouds, a dragon-drawn carriage welcomes them. Should they desire to visit the turtle palaces of the Purple Court, cranes dance above their crown; should they wish to wander the jade terraces and jeweled gardens, clouds arise beneath their feet.

When the kalpa-fire rages, they roam freely in the realm of suchness; when the mulberry fields turn to sea, they wander blissfully in the paradise of ultimate joy. Gathering, they take form; dispersing, they become qi—hidden and manifest, unfathomable; transformations, endless. They enter water and fire without drowning or burning, tread the sun and moon without form or shadow. Blades and weapons cannot harm them; tigers and rhinoceroses cannot injure them. Yin and yang cannot alter them; the Five Phases cannot mold them. Yama cannot decree their death; Indra cannot control their life. They move and abide at will, coming and going freely.

Truly, as Ziyang said:

A single elixir pill swallowed into the belly—
only then does one know: "My fate is not heaven’s to command."
This is the season of fulfillment for the true hero,
the day when merit is achieved and fame secured.
Having reached this point in life, how could one not rejoice?

Master Shangyang said:
All the heroes of the mortal world scatter their glory in vain,
exhausting merit and fame—all ultimately empty.
Only the golden elixir is most wondrous,
manifesting divine power in the Great Brahma Heaven.

**Oral Instructions of the Ninth Section on Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life**

**The Body of Emptiness Transcends the Three Realms**
*(Illustrations: "Transcending the Three Realms" and "Attaining the Fruit of Vairocana")*

According to the *Transformations of the Queen Mother*:
When I was at court, I heard words from beyond the world and renounced glory to return to the Dao.
Meeting a recluse who pointed the way, I received the mind-seal transmission and the true oral instructions:
"This is the method of the Great Sage of the West’s return to quiescence.
If you can recite and practice it, you may transcend life and death, die yet not perish, and ultimately attain perfect enlightenment.
If you abandon the path midway, you may still choose your dwelling place and become an immortal."

I have since surveyed the immortals of the Han and Tang dynasties—many transcended and departed from this very point.
Is this not what the *Transformations* calls "abandoning the path midway"?
I have also read the *Song of Dragon’s Tooth*:
"Cultivating the Dao is like drilling for fire—
if you stop at the first smoke, you must not cease."

I have further examined the immortals of the Song and Yuan dynasties—many attained liberation at this stage.
Is this not what *Dragon’s Tooth* calls "stopping at the smoke"?
Though they became immortals, they lacked the final effort,
leaving some instability in the end.
As Master Fu said:
"Even after eighty thousand kalpas,
one ultimately falls into emptiness and annihilation."

Was it that they did not know their lifespan was limited and thus failed to cultivate in time?
Or did they not obtain this method and so could not complete their practice?
The school of life cultivation only knows refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness—
yet entirely neglects the stage of refining emptiness to merge with the Dao.
Thus the supreme master said:
"Though you nurture the golden elixir round as the moon,
it will still wax and wane.
How much better to refine a red sun,
illuminating the Three Realms and the ten directions."

Indeed, even the highest sagely cultivation lacks this final stage.
The alchemical classics and philosophical texts never speak of this last step.
Only Li Qing’an ever touched upon it.
When a disciple asked, "Is there further transformation after the birth of the immortal embryo?"
Qing’an replied: "There is still transformation."
The Sage said:
"A body beyond the body is not yet extraordinary—
only when emptiness is pulverized does the whole truth appear."
Thus, after the birth of the immortal embryo, one must tread firmly on the ground,
waiting until one’s body becomes one with emptiness before the work is complete.
He also said: "There is still the stage of refining emptiness—
seek it beyond words."

His insight surpasses that of all immortals,
yet he refused to speak plainly of the actual practice:
what refining emptiness entails, or where it leads.
He merely passed over it in vague ambiguity.
Was it that he did not grasp the ancestral intent and so could not explain?
Or was he afraid of leaking celestial secrets and dared not speak?

Thus Master Shuichou sighed:
"Shattering emptiness dissolves kalpas beyond count—
once you reach the other shore, abandon the boat and oars.
I’ve read ten thousand alchemical texts,
yet no one speaks the final word."

This secret mind-seal transmission has been passed from buddha to buddha, hand to hand,
from patriarch to patriarch, until the robe and bowl of the Sixth Ancestor ceased—
and the secret was not transmitted to the buddhas, remaining sealed ever since.
Few have known it since.
Thus it is said: "The Seventh Ancestor has yet to appear."

Until my master, Master Yin, with his innate spiritual roots,
received the teachings transmitted outside the scriptures.
One day, he penetrated the barrier of Chan,
suddenly achieving thorough understanding—
and the secret treasury of a thousand buddhas reopened in this age.
Thus his enlightenment verse says:
"When the knot of doubt is shattered,
the heart-flowers of a thousand buddhas bloom here.
Advancing beyond the great pole’s summit,
the true master of emptiness becomes the teacher of gods and humans."

Now, inheriting my master’s instructions, I have obtained this method,
as if gaining a priceless pearl.
As the monk of Jiannan said:
"Since I spoke of this luminous pearl,
even the wheel-turning kings of Brahmā and Śakra are no longer desired."

Yet the buddhas’ realm is lofty,
and one must ultimately reach the original body of emptiness.
Only when the body of emptiness is attained does one achieve supreme perfect enlightenment and enter nirvana.
Thus Shao Kangjie said:
"The sage shares the same body as the Great Void,
the same function as heaven and earth."

People today seek its meaning in vain,
sighing and saying:
"Take the body of the Great Void as your body,
take the function of heaven and earth as your function."
These words are like peering at the sun through a window—
one sees only its light and shadow.
If you say, "Take the body of the Great Void as your body,"
you are positing a Great Void and clinging to the notion of "body"—
how then can you embody the Great Void?
If you say, "Take the function of heaven and earth as your function,"
you are positing heaven and earth and clinging to the notion of "function"—
how then can you function as heaven and earth?

Yet does the Great Void know it has a body?
Or does it not know?
Do heaven and earth know they have a function?
Or do they not know?
The Great Void does not know it has a body,
yet the function of heaven and earth resides in the body of the Great Void.
Heaven and earth do not know they have a function,
yet the body of the Great Void resides in the function of heaven and earth.
The body embodies what it embodies—
it embodies what it functions.
The function functions what it functions—
it functions what it embodies.

Only when emptiness is pulverized is the work complete.
Why?
Because the original body is fundamentally emptiness.
If you cling to the appearance of emptiness, it is not the original body of emptiness.
The original state is fundamentally pulverization.
If you have a mind for pulverization, it is not emptiness.
Only when you do not know there is emptiness
can you speak of the original body of the Great Void and heaven and earth.
Only when you do not know there is pulverization
can you speak of the emptiness of the Great Void and heaven and earth.

Having thoroughly penetrated to the original body of the Void at this stage, one has yet to stabilize this original body within the Void itself. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: *"The nature of dharmas is like space; all buddhas dwell within it."* Here, one realizes that the Void is the original body, and the original body is the Void. Yet one must press onward with further effort, advancing ceaselessly until the very limits of existence—turning at the hundred-foot pole. Only then may one reach the root-source of non-arising and non-ceasing, ultimately arriving at the awakened shore of non-arising and non-ceasing. This is the ultimate attainment. There is nothing more to it than returning the self to the Void, restoring the self to Nothingness. This return and restoration is the turning of the mechanism. Thus it is said: *"With a single thought’s turning of the mechanism, one instantly regains the original state."*

In the end, the primordial origin of humanity arises from the midst of Nothingness. Nothingness transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into *qi*, and *qi* transforms into form—this is the sequential process of human birth. Now, form reverts back into *qi*, *qi* reverts back into spirit, and spirit reverts back into Nothingness—this is the reverse process of immortal transcendence. As the ancients said: *"What is higher than heaven? That which gives birth to heaven. What is greater than the Void? That which moves the Void."* For the Great Dao is the parent of the Void, the Void is the parent of heaven and earth, and heaven and earth are the parents of all beings. Heaven and earth are vast, thus they give birth to the myriad things; the Void is boundless, thus it gives birth to heaven and earth; and within the Void, there is that which is not empty, thus it gives birth to the Void. When we speak of giving birth to heaven and earth and the myriad things, it is this non-emptiness within the Void that presides over them. Precisely because it is non-empty within the Void, it can deeply enter the nature of all things, presiding over and facilitating them.

Do not think that this non-emptiness within the Void merely enters the nature of all things to preside over and facilitate them—it also deeply enters the nature of heaven and earth, presiding over and facilitating them. Do not think that this non-emptiness within the Void merely enters the nature of heaven and earth to preside over and facilitate them—it also deeply enters the Void itself, presiding over and facilitating it. That which is non-empty within the Void is True Emptiness. True Emptiness is the Great Dao.

Those who refine spirit to return to the Void still dwell in the secondary principle and have not yet attained the supreme and most authentic Dao of Laozi. Those who refine the Void to merge with the Dao—this is the foremost principle of the sage emperors, the supreme vehicle of the Buddha’s teaching. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *"Though one traverses all buddha-lands throughout the endless future, without seeking this wondrous Dharma, one will never attain bodhi."* This Dharma is nothing other than refining the yang spirit to return it to the ocean of Vairocana’s nature.

Thus, one gathers the previously dispersed spirits of differentiated forms back into the original body, then dissolves the spirit of the original body into the Celestial Valley, and finally withdraws the spirit of the Celestial Valley into the ancestral aperture. Like a dragon nurturing the pearl beneath its brow or a hen brooding the egg in its nest, one guards it tightly, allowing no further emergence. All that has been cultivated and realized is now cast into the realm of Non-Beginning. Abiding in the cessation of all mental activity, one extinguishes all, as Śākyamuni secluded himself in Magadha or Vimalakīrti sealed his lips in Vaiśālī. This is why the natural transformation of nature and destiny, the restoration of the Void, cannot cease. Having restored nature and destiny, having restored the Void, one has undergone five transformations. Yet transformation is not exhausted in transformation, and alchemy is not exhausted in alchemy—this is not the supreme spiritual transformation of the most numinous.

Thus, the spirit is refined a hundred times and grows ever more numinous; gold is refined a hundred times and grows ever more pure. Refining and refining again, a single furnace’s flames refine the Void, transmuting it into ten thousand acres of fine ice. The world within the pot appears as small as a millet grain. After a while, the spirit-light fills the cavity, the radiance of the sun blazes into the sky. From the inner aperture, it extends to the outer apertures—nine great apertures, and within each of the nine, every aperture is filled with spirit-light. Eighty-four thousand minor apertures, and within each of the eighty-four thousand, every aperture is filled with spirit-light. It penetrates within and without, through top and bottom, everywhere suffused with spirit-light. Like a hundred thousand lamps illuminating a single chamber, each lamp shines upon the others, each light intermingling with the rest. People and things alike are all illumined within this spirit-light. This is indeed wondrous, yet it is still not the ultimate. However, if it does not fill the space between heaven and earth, it has not yet matched the measure of the sage of Lu, who *"governs the origin to unify heaven."*

Again, one gathers the spirit and conceals its radiance, dissolving it back into the ancestral aperture, free from all defilement. Abiding in the cessation of all mental activity, one extinguishes all. After a long cessation, the spirit-light flashes like lightning from the clouds, piercing through the upper aperture from the central one. Great apertures and small, every aperture is filled with spirit-light. The luminosity shines brilliantly, illuminating the ten directions, reaching upward through the celestial realms, downward through the earthly realms, and through the human realm in between. Within the Three Realms, everywhere is suffused with spirit-light. Like the mutual reflection of the Qin mirror or the interpenetration of the imperial pearls, light upon light intermingles, each clearly manifesting. Spirits and ghosts alike are all illumined within this spirit-light. This is indeed marvelous, yet it is still not the ultimate. However, if it does not pervade the dust-mote realms of the Dharma, it has not yet matched the measure of the sage of India, Vairocana.

Once more, one gathers the spirit and conceals its radiance, dissolving it back into the ancestral aperture, free from all defilement. Abiding in the cessation of all mental activity, one extinguishes all. After a long cessation, the six dragons complete their transformation, and the spirit-light crystallizes into the light of the śarīra. Like the blazing sun, it surges forth from within the ancestral aperture, radiating into ten thousand ten thousand rays of light, piercing straight through to the nine heavens above.

Should the light shine forth like a hundred thousand suns of radiant brightness, suffusing the entirety of a trichiliocosm with its illumination—then sages and worthies, along with the vast array of all phenomena, would appear in unison within the śarīra-light. Thus did the Great Awakened Chan Master declare:

*A single śarīra-light, resplendent and bright,
Illumines all kalpas, boundless in might.
The trichiliocosm bows in homage true,
The thirty-three heavens all gather in view.*

Yet even as the śarīra-light pervades the trichiliocosm, its measure remains unfulfilled. From within that trichiliocosm, it once more emits boundless jeweled rays, filling the Land of Ultimate Bliss to overflowing. Then it ascends to the realm of the *Kaśāya Banner*, rises further to the *Sound-Wheel Realm*, and surges straight into the *Victorious Lotus World*, where it meets the Tathāgata *Bhadraśrī*. Since time without beginning, they have been parted—only now do they finally reunite. Their śarīra-lights intermingle, merging into oneness, thus and so, naturally, boundlessly vast.

Hence the scriptural verse:

*All Buddhas are like a great mirror’s round,
My body is as a wish-fulfilling gem.
The Buddhas’ Dharma-body enters my form,
My form ever dwells in the Buddhas’ frame.*

Master Hongren of the Wang lineage said:
*A single Buddha, two, ten million more—
All are none other than one’s very self.
The roots of goodness planted long ago
Today still draw upon that primal force.*

Chan Master Heze declared:
*The original face is true Suchness,
Discerned within the śarīra-light’s glow.
After eons lost, at last I see—
My own nature is Mañjuśrī, I now know.*

When self-nature is pure, it is the Immaculate Buddha.
When self-nature is thus, it is the Free Buddha.
When self-nature is undimmed, it is the Radiant Buddha.
When self-nature is firm, it is the Indestructible Buddha.
Each and every Buddha is fully present within oneself.

To speak of it exhaustively: there is but one nature. Your nature is mind; mind is Buddha. The newly awakened Buddha and the long-realized one share no dual substance. The reward-body conforms to the Dharma-body as a cast image to its mold—though the image is newly formed, it is fundamentally the same as the old, with no difference in essence. The newly realized Buddha and the ancient Buddha share no dual form. The Dharma-body conforms to the reward-body as molten gold to a statue—though the gold was once unshaped, once shaped, all Buddhas are like the golden sage already formed, while sentient beings resemble unrefined gold ore. Though formed and unformed seem to follow in sequence, the gold’s essence remains unchanged from beginning to end.

Thus the *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* states:
*Once gold is refined, it is no longer ore.
Through endless time, the gold’s nature stays pure.*

This gold-nature is inherently possessed by each and every being. All sentient beings of the ten directions are my Vajra Buddha-nature, and the myriad things of heaven and earth are all encompassed within my Tathāgata’s Dharma-body. At this stage, one realizes that heaven and earth share the same root as I, and the ten thousand things are one body with me. The entire Dharma-realm is a single *tathāgatagarbha*; the vast earth is the body of the Dharma King. In reality, there is no distinction—one attains enlightenment simultaneously with the Buddhas of the three times. In true emptiness, all is equal—one enters nirvāṇa on the same day as the ten kinds of beings.

The Dharma-body is so vast that even empty space cannot contain it. The true mind is so wondrous that even spirits and ghosts cannot fathom its workings. A single day and night spans the infinite future; a single instant encompasses the ocean of dust-motes. From the distant past to the present and beyond, nothing exists apart from this all-sustaining principle. From the heavens above to the earth below, nothing exists apart from this all-pervading presence.

The Second Patriarch, Huike, said:
*Whole and complete, this is the One—
Unchanging through endless lives and aeons.*

Thus the Most High declared:
*Though heaven and earth may crumble, this does not.*

This alone is the true self; this alone is true Suchness; this alone is the true nature and life; this alone is the true fundamental substance; this alone is the true empty space; this alone is the true reality; this alone is the bodhimandala; this alone is the true ground of nirvāṇa; this alone is neither defiled nor pure; this alone is neither form nor emptiness; this alone is the self-awakened sagely wisdom; this alone is the supreme Dharma-wheel; this alone is the emptiness of original nature, the true substance of emptiness; this alone is the ever-abiding true mind, spontaneously free; this alone is the Buddha’s wondrous function, boundless bliss; this alone is the purity of afflictions and karma, originally quiescent; this alone is the dreamlike unreality of all causes and effects; this alone is the extinction of birth and death, the bliss of quiescence; this alone is the indestructible, unchanging true body; this alone is the primordial spirit, unborn and undying; this alone is immeasurable, unnameable, inconceivable, of limitless merit; this alone is the pure Dharma-body, the perfect reward-body, the hundred thousand billion transformation-bodies, Vairocana Buddha.

A verse declares:
*In heaven above and earth below, none compare to the Buddha.
Throughout the ten directions’ worlds, none can rival him.
All that exists within the world I fully perceive—
Yet nothing in all creation equals the Buddha.*
