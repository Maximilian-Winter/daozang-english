*The Complete Biography of Tang Hongren’s Universally Beneficent, Trustworthy, and Protective Emperor Lord Pure Yang Lü the Immortal*
Compiled by Lü the Immortal of Pure Yang,
Revised by Wang Xiangxu, styled Danyi Zi, a devoted disciple of the Dao,
Collated by fellow Daoists He Yingchun, Wu Daolong, Fei Qin, Zheng Rucheng, Zhong Shan, and Zha Zongqi

My surname is Lü, my given name Yan, my courtesy name Dongbin, and my sobriquet Pure Yang. Originally, I hailed from Luoxia in Henan. My great-grandfather Yi, fleeing a feud, settled in the old Huoshui Village of central Guangdong, where he fathered Xian and Zhuo. Xian begot me, Yan, while Zhuo died young.

My father, in his youth, studied for the imperial examinations but met with no success. Turning to household affairs, he instructed his son in the classics. On the night before my birth, a Daoist—clad in a yellow turban and black robe, his beard and hair coiled like dragons, his temples streaked with white—leaned upon an iron-tipped staff, a gourd slung at his side, and chanted as he wandered the streets:

*The clear wind drifts and drifts,*
*Brushing my robes.*
*The white clouds rise and rise,*
*Following me in flight.*
*The jade pendants chime and chime,*
*Descending from heaven’s thoroughfare.*
*They bear this soul away,*
*To the land of mugwort and reeds.*
*One day, returning,*
*We shall meet in the realm of nothingness.*

My father, recognizing him as a man of the Dao, invited him home and offered a vegetarian feast. The Daoist drew from his sleeve a medicine and said, “Your wife, née Wang, will go into labor at the hour of the rat tomorrow. Give her this medicine, and she will bear a son.” My father bowed in gratitude. Suddenly, the Daoist dissolved into a gust of pure wind and vanished, leaving behind a poem upon the table.

The poem read:

*A minor Daoist from Zhongnan,*
*Brings you immortal spirits—*
*His name is Yan, of the mountain crags.*
*A guest in the grotto’s halls.*

At midnight the following day, the child was indeed born, filling the air with rare fragrance for ten *li* around, while a long rainbow descended and purple light swirled about the door. The hour of his birth was the fourth day of the eighth month in the second year of the Zhenguan reign of the Tang, during the hour of the rat. From infancy, he was keen and quick-witted; by his first year, he could recite the *Book of Songs* and read the *Book of Documents*, understanding filial piety and brotherly respect. He never ate before his elders, never walked ahead of his seniors, never spoke before being addressed, never laughed before others, never displayed anger before his parents. His parents cherished him. At the age of five, his father, recalling the Daoist’s words, named him Yan.

For three years, he studied by lamplight, mastering the *Three Ritual Classics*, the *Five Canons*, and the works of the Hundred Schools without omission. His teacher marveled at him. One day, during a gathering of scholars, the teacher tested them with the theme *"The Beauty of the East."* No sooner had the topic been announced than I took up my brush and composed the following on the spot:

*The fine night trims the silver lamp bright,*
*A precious mirror hangs high, ten thousand *li* clear.*
*Why need the flute to summon the phoenix?*
*Purple void drifts down with the chime of pendants.*

*In the chime of pendants, her song is artful,*
*Mid-heaven’s steps tread on golden hooks so slight.*
*Fusang steals forth from the crystal palace,*
*Guanghan pacts in secret to wander quiet.*

*That year, they spoke not of Wu’s bestowal,*
*Today, cease boasting of Chu’s fair maid.*
*Her heart yields not to the dream of Wu Mountain,*
*Her grace still mirrors Guye’s screen.*

*From a kingdom that topples cities, the beauty comes,*
*Yet the beauty does not topple—men are ensnared.*
*Let others’ passionate eyes stir emotion,*
*I have an iron heart, firmer than stone.*

*All her thousand graces are but demons’ guile,*
*Her laughing mouth, her delicate limbs—all ravagers.*
*Daji and Bao Si ruined the Nine Lands,*
*Lust for beauty is truly to be loathed.*

*I shall nurture my true qi, self-contained,*
*Through all the springs and autumns, joy unbounded.*

My teacher fell silent, already sensing my aspirations beyond the clouds, though he concealed it. The following year, he arranged a marriage for me from among the candidates on the screen. I showed reluctance, and my parents were displeased, so I reluctantly agreed. I was thus betrothed to the daughter of Eunuch Liu, the Commandant, and though the marriage was consummated, we did not become intimate. Three years later, she bore a child.

It was the day my parents celebrated their seventieth birthdays, and guests were invited to offer toasts. As the third round of drinks was served, three beggars entered the hall—wearing bamboo-leaf hats, clad in straw robes, barefoot, and carrying baskets. I angrily ordered them driven away, but they remained unmoved. My parents offered them food and drink, yet the beggars paid no heed. When asked their purpose, they replied, “We wish to beg alongside your son, Yan.” My father laughed, thinking them mad. My mother, growing rude, ordered the servants to beat and expel them. The beggars remained unperturbed. A burly, bearded man glared at them, and the crowd shrank back, none daring to approach. The beggars then clapped their hands and laughed loudly, singing a song:

*We’re roving men of the clouds,*
*Seeking a few bowls of Magu’s wine and rice.*
*We’ll not take your leftover cups or scraps,*
*Nor force your heart to comply.*
*We’ve learned to roam free, unbound,*
*Far better than your days of toil and strife.*

Then a broad-eyed, iron-faced man with a thick beard raised his chin and joined in:

*Laugh if you will at our beggar’s guise,*
*But know—we brothers are wild men of Zhongnan.*
*To enlighten the foolish, we evade fate’s net,*
*Descend from the clouds to cast aside a guest.*
*You call us drifting duckweed, rootless reeds—*
*Yet who rules the floating world?*

Then an elderly man, white-haired and gaunt, holding a pair of clappers, struck the bamboo and sang:

Alas, we’ve cast aside the snares of gain,
adrift upon the Weak Water’s span.
We’ve placed the cosmos, sun, and moon within a reed’s embrace,
all for the sake of that young man of grace.
Thus do we seek to lift and guide,
to conjure wine and food beside.
Yet fear we parting’s bitter sting—
to meet again would cost remembering.

At that moment, I knew they were no common sort.
I stepped forward and bowed, offering a meal, which they declined.
The bearded one said, “One day on the road to Handan, we shall meet again.
Bring forth a dou of wine for us three then.”
I assented. Turning my head, they suddenly became three birds,
soaring southward and gone.

The feast ended, the guests dispersed,
yet I, filled with longing, could not rest.
Sleepless, I took up Wu paper and dipped my brush of Guan,
composing a *ci* titled *“Gazing at the Cloud Lords.”* The lyrics read:

*In the bright hall, spring’s long day,
twin stars appear in radiant display.
As songs and flutes resound the feast,
auspicious mist swirls in the east.
Sunlight through parasol leaves and daylilies gleams,
wind toys with dancing sleeves and flying sashes’ seams.
We raise jade cups to Mount Song’s height,
wishing boundless years of endless light.*

*From whence came these divine beings,
transformed as beggars on the way?*
*Their pure voices worthy of praise,*
*their gaunt forms lovelier each day.*
*Like the nine-jointed atractylis, tall and bright,*
*their noble spirits soar in flight.*
*I long to follow them away—*
*cross Wu Gorge, sail Penglai’s bay.*

*Yet who knows the dusty ties not yet undone,*
*the debts of past lives still to run?*
*I remain at my desk, my heart in vain,*
*my dreaming soul wearied again.*

Unsated still, I then composed a regulated verse. The poem reads:

The peacock screen unfolds—daylight lingers long,
a jeweled censer sends coiled incense, rare fragrance strong.
The east wind lifts the curtain, Jade Pool’s auspice bright,
from the Southern Pole, cups pass the Sea-House’s brew in light.
A pair of cranes, unhurried, bear ripe peaches in their beaks,
the Three Stars from afar herald chrysanthemums’ first peaks.
When men return beyond the ninefold heavens’ clouded height,
how many geese in misty haze stretch into fading light?

The moon sank past the eastern peaks, stars streamed o’er the briny deep,
magpies startled into flight, village cocks their dawn-song keep.
Just then, my noble friend in sable cloak sent word to roam
the Han River’s waves—my carefree lad readied me to come.
Our boat moored midstream, my golden friend raised his cup in toast.
Among the guests sat Li Yuanhan, a man of old renown, who hailed:
“Next year’s grand examination—I’ve seen an omen in the night:
Brother Lü, you’ll surely mount the dragon’s head in flight.”
I smiled and said, “Your heart outstrips mine, thus the omen’s true.
If I indeed succeed, I’ll hook a fish when we cast through.”
We three in jest cast lines—mine snared a golden carp that day,
while neither of my friends drew aught from the water’s sway.

My golden friend then composed a lyric, offering wine in celebration:
*Spring’s examination hall, orioles urge in hushed refrain,
fish and dragons from the four seas return in turn again.
All vie to leap the Dragon Gate, transformed by fate’s decree,
awaiting the light wave’s thunderous roar to set them free.*
*Warm peach waves flow, green ripples glide,*
*golden scales and fins drift far and wide.*
*Seizing the dragon’s head, soaring the azure height,*
*all will hail the returned top scholar’s light.*

I drained my cup and matched his verse in reply:
*The midday clepsydra fades, red headscarf urges near,*
*idly donning court robes, listening for phoenixes’ return to hear.*
*My talents, long prepared, now test their mettle true,*
*once roused the spring river’s thunder, as in days of yore I knew.*
*Heroes arise, all follow in train,*
*phoenix towers and golden chariots their paths sustain.*
*Let deeds of merit grace the annals’ page,*
*with purple sashes woven through embroidered robes of state’s sage.*

We exchanged more toasts and jests, when suddenly my carefree lad cried out:
“A green bird comes from the west—its hue like kingfisher’s dye,
its form vast as a chariot wheel, its cry deep as a bronze bell’s chime.
It soared to mid-heaven, then transformed into a green-robed maid,
holding a waist drum, singing Daoist songs unafraid.”
We three at first disbelieved, but listened in quietude.
Soon, its sound rang clear as chimes, its rhythm slow and subdued—
pure as a light breeze stirring a delicate spring’s flow,
distant as a fisherman’s song fading where the deep waters go,
resonant as an empty valley answering the phoenix’s call.

The music swelled—now joyous enough to stir laughter, now sorrowful enough to draw tears. We lifted the boat’s canopy and gazed upward: the maiden rose and descended thrice, approached and retreated twice, while clouds now gathered, now parted, now soared, now stilled. The three of us knelt and beckoned her. After a brief pause, she struck her waist drum and sang:

*"Drifting free, unbound, beyond the red dust’s snare—*
*no worldly cares to bind or bear.*
*Magu’s rice in one bowl, mugwort and lotus my sash and gown.*
*On the long road, astride my blue ox, I roam—*
*all I know is ease, untroubled, alone.*
*Laugh at you, chasing fame and gain in vain,*
*scheming, grasping, never content—*
*hoard a thousand taels of gold, yet still you crave more.*
*Toiling, fretting, gray-haired at last—*
*what was it all for?"*

I offered her fine wine. With a sweep of her sleeve, she soared into the air and sang again:

*"Rolling waves, surging dust—*
*laugh at your little boat tossed and thrust.*
*How can one pole withstand the river’s gale?*
*Soon the wind will seize your sail,*
*and though you long to turn to shore,*
*you’ll share the gulls’ fate no more.*
*What choice have you?*
*No escape from the dream of Huainan’s court!*
*Cast off the cage, I say,*
*kick away the hollow play.*
*Set your heart on the Elixir’s round—*
*only when you reach the Dao’s shore*
*will this vessel be yours forevermore."*

Her voice faded into the distance, her form vanished without trace. She left behind a table, on which lay a single gatha:

*"Listen well to my words,*
*turn not toward the imperial court.*
*Hasten back to Handan’s crossroads,*
*and feast with me on mist and cloud."*

I performed the esoteric mudra she had shown me, yet failed to grasp her meaning. My companions, now deep in their cups, remained oblivious. As dusk fell, we turned the boat homeward. My parents stood at the gate, watching as I entered with joy. I recounted the tale, but my mother did not believe it.

The following winter, my mother fell ill with a fever. I forsook food and sleep, day and night, praying to the mountain spirit to take her place—yet she did not recover. I offered sacrifices to the Dipper—still no cure. I cut flesh from my thigh, burned incense, and her condition briefly improved. But the fever lodged in her chest and belly, and she longed for water. The local springs were parched, their waters foul; only the Han River ran clear, though its distant, silt-choked banks made drawing water arduous. I fetched it myself, nearly swept away by the waves several times, yet still it could not quench her thirst. That night, I prayed at the Dragon King’s shrine. Suddenly, a dry well in the temple courtyard gushed forth sweet spring water. Each day, I drew from it for my mother, and within ten days, her illness was gone. To this day, the Spring of Master Lü remains, and people call it the fruit of filial devotion.

During the years after the Zhenguan era, our prefecture suffered poor harvests. The people reaped nothing, yet tax collectors pressed urgently, leaving the poor in dire straits. My family had stored ten thousand *hu* of grain. My father and I deliberated and resolved: all those unable to meet the tax were to be supplied by us. We exhausted our stores to aid them, saving tens of thousands of lives. The authorities, learning of this, bestowed upon our village the banner of "Righteousness."

The next year, in the *dingmao* cycle, the imperial examination approached. The prefecture nominated me. My parents urged me to prepare, and the carefree lad was tasked with carrying my luggage. I bade farewell to my lofty curtains and fragrant chamber, then set forth. My young wife, well-versed in classics and history, composed a poem to send me off:

*"Spare not the roadside blossoms—*
*one glance back, and they lie at heaven’s edge.*
*The east wind, cruel, scatters the wandering rider,*
*staining him with mad fragrance, leaving only sighs.*
*Only sighs—*
*how vainly your soul will wander,*
*circling the Milky Way’s raft.*
*When you stand on the Dragon’s Roll, boast if you must,*
*with golden saddle, jade bridle, and black gauze cap.*
*Once the emperor’s favor graces you,*
*return home swiftly—*
*do not drift like a reed on the waves,*
*lest I gaze in vain toward the horizon’s end."*

I took my leave and journeyed on. At Hengpu, I hired a boat. There, I encountered an old fisherman in a small skiff, singing the *"Song of Canglang"*:

*"Clad in green straw cloak, bamboo hat upon my brow,*
*at dawn I pole into the willow-flower isle.*
*In the misty river, my long rod I cast—*
*only fear the fish won’t take the hook.*
*Won’t take the hook, oh won’t take the hook,*
*leaving me to drown in endless sorrow.*
*Not that I crave wealth or gain,*
*but dread the fate that may be yours in the end."*

I called to him, but he did not draw near. Instead, he dipped his oars and drifted toward the depths of the cloud-wreathed waves, singing again:

*"Misty waters stretch endlessly, the wind so clear,*
*a single boat holds all my joy.*
*Look at those chasing fame and rank,*
*clutching at wealth and power, hearts never full.*
*Some beg in rags for kindness,*
*some seek high office with flattery,*
*some speak bluntly to the lord,*
*some fawn on rulers through their maids.*
*They dream of glory for a thousand ages—*
*yet know this: after death, only an empty name remains.*
*Only an empty name, oh only an empty name!*
*Better to cast off this red dust,*
*and spend my days by rivers and lakes,*
*hooking fish and crabs, drinking village wine till I’m drunk,*
*never once looking back."*

He vanished into the distance. I crossed the river in another boat.

As spring’s first light grew radiant, jade split the indigo fields; willows unfurled along the banks, orioles trilled their clever tunes, and swallows darted like swift shears. Fragrant carriages set noblewomen’s wheels in motion, while fine steeds bore the reins of young lords. Suddenly, thoughts of my homeland surged within me, and gazing at the white clouds, I wept until tears streamed down.

A carefree youth approached and said: *"Master, you grieve—why not rest? Why do you wander now? Why have you left your parents, abandoned your wife and children? This journey of yours brings honor to your kin, brings honor to your family—yet with one honor, a thousand humiliations fade. What cause for sorrow remains? Master, rest!"*

Between my sobs, the heaviness in my heart would not relent. Was I moved by mere self-love? No—my parents were aged, their warmth and care now sparse. Still, the youth’s words held merit, and my spirit felt a fleeting ease.

As I walked through the greenwood path, I encountered a youth like the rogue of Huaiyin’s marketplace, blocking my way with no passage allowed. My servant and I pleaded endlessly, emptying our purses to him, keeping only our zither and sword. The rest he seized in one sweep, sparing us only our breath. With our traveling funds exhausted, how could we continue our journey?

The youth begged for food while I carried my zither and books. Along the road, we met the same beggar from my home—a burly, whiskered man—who laughed and said: *"Scholar, scholar! Once I begged at your door, and you drove me away; your parents drove me away too. Now you are driven by others as well. Back then, the three of us wanted to beg with you, but you, a rich young master, scoffed: ‘What business have the wealthy with begging?’ Today, why not stay home and enjoy your fortune? Why beg like us? Hah!"*

Silent, I felt a deep shame, having forgotten my past deeds.

The burly man drew from his basket a bowl of rice, its stench unbearable—maggots writhing in the thin gruel. He said to me, *"Eat this, and now you and I are of the same company."* I knit my brows, furrowing my forehead, refusing to look. The man gathered it up and left.

My hunger gnawed fiercely, but the youth returned with a bowl of parched grain, which I ate to fill my stomach, thinking no more of food. When I asked where he had found it, he told me it was from the same burly man.

We pressed onward with all haste, our suffering beyond words. Arriving at Puyin Village, we found three diverging paths, no human trace in sight—only the crisscrossing tracks of beasts and birds, leaving us at a loss for direction. We rested beneath an ancient locust tree, glad for the gentle breeze that revived our spirits. In the distance, we heard a herdsman’s song:

*The mountain flowers bloom,
The oriole’s cry is drawn out.
Blowing a short flute, he steps over the layered ridges,
Riding a young calf, he roams the hidden valleys,
Seeing the four wilds so still and quiet.
Still and quiet—
No cares, no troubles,
No black, no white.
The heart wanders free,
Singing a song of the lotus fall,
Forgetting the world is small.*

*The pine shade thickens,
The fiery clouds fade.
He taps out the last moves on a stone chessboard,
Plays a bamboo flute with no fixed tune—
What care has he for the world’s cruel turns?
The cool wind stirs,
The bamboo rustles.
Watching the kites and fish fill his gaze,
Heaven’s work is revealed,
The mystery at every turn.
The golden breeze fills the ridge,
Maple leaves blush red.
A tung leaf drifts lightly down,
The autumn cricket’s lonely cry—
How pitiable is man, a drifting twig.*

*A drifting twig—
When will the dream end?
One must look within.
Why waste the spirit,
Draining life’s essence,
Like a withered leaf’s root?*

*Crimson clouds fill the sky,
Plum blossoms shatter jade.
How many warm chambers with red braziers?
How many wives wail, children weep?
Laugh at the futile bustle of the human world.
The human world’s bustle—
When will it be enough?
Impermanence hurries near.
Slowly, slowly,
The temples whiten—
Can gold and silver buy them back?*

I listened to the voice but saw no figure. I sent the youth to follow the sound, but after a long while, he did not return.

Suddenly, a perfected one appeared—clad in a patchwork robe of a hundred hues, his hair coiled in twin topknots, his beard thick upon his cheeks, his eyes like an ancient dragon’s, his earlobes hanging to his shoulders. His feet were shod in hempen sandals with many loops, a yellow sash bound his waist, and from it hung a gourd and an indigo pouch. In his hand, he held a palm-fiber whisk, its heart long gone. Grinning, he strode before me, then fixed me with a glare and barked: *"Scholar, why do you tarry? The sky darkens, and I know well this place—by day, it teems with brigands; by night, with tigers and wolves. This is no safe haven for rest."*

I rose and bowed deeply. The man at once sat down, facing me knee-to-knee, silent as if in dhyāna. After a long while, I respectfully addressed him, but the master kept his gaze steady upon me and asked: *"Where are you bound?"*

I answered that I journeyed to take the imperial examinations.

The master said: *"Young and learned—just the sort to serve the Son of Heaven above and succor the common folk below, that we humble ones might bask in your beneficence. A fortunate encounter indeed! Yet I have one word for you—remember it well."*

I nodded, ready to receive his teaching.

The master said:

"The winds and waves are cruel, oh so cruel,
In the arena of fame and gain, stand firm of foot.
Beware missteps on the path ahead—
Once you lose this root-sprout,
Ten thousand turns, a thousand days will fail to grasp it.

Go home, go home—take heed in earnest!
Come, come—like a cicada shedding its husk.
Break through the maze of delusion and leap beyond,
By the Golden Weighted Mountain, you’ll find your descent.

I then inquired of my future path: *'Master, do you know?'*
He only shook his head and said:
*The road ahead, the road ahead—
Ten thousand miles of soaring flight, no delay.
A life entrusted to the royal house,
Through life and death, no thought for self.
Since ancient times, loyalty has perished in the cauldron’s depths—
Heroes are but hares in snares.
What use are posthumous inscriptions to the world?
Wealth and rank are but dew on the mugwort.
The eastern wilds’ mounds rise steep and high,
How many pearl-adorned scholars lie within?
I wearied of his words, but the master said: *'Why not wander the clouds with me?
So much joy to be had!'*

I laughed: *'Master, you err.
You dine on coarse grains,
Feast on wild mountain mugwort,
Drink from stone-chiseled streams,
Clothe yourself in tattered hemp,
Have neither parents nor wife,
No lofty halls nor grand estates,
No friends nor companions,
No kin nor visitors,
No servants to attend you—
Where is the joy in that?'*

The master covered his mouth and chuckled: *'Let me tell you of joy.'*
In an instant, he drew a *yugu* drum from his sack and sang a *daoqing* ballad. The lyrics went:"

"Our coarse grains outshine lamb and mutton,
Our ferns and mugwort surpass a hundred fragrant flavors.
The stone-stream’s spring we drink—
No need for grape wine here.
Our patchwork robes suffice—
No silks or brocades for us.
A single hut of stone walls and thatched eaves
Outdoes those towering halls a hundred *zhang* long.
We read not a few lines of books,
Nor know of emperors or kings.
What care we for Qin’s strength or Chu’s weakness, their struggles for supremacy?
What care we for Han’s rise and fall, its glory and ruin?
We delight in deer and cranes,
At times spreading blue clouds as our hundred passes.
Sometimes we ride a light boat to roam the seas,
Sometimes mount a small crane for leisurely flights,
Sometimes take the form of an ordinary man,
Sometimes conceal ourselves as things unseen.
The cosmos traversed without restraint—
Who governs this carefree wandering?
No yin or yang,
No short or long.
No turning of heaven or overturning of earth to mark growth and decline,
No past or present to distinguish soft and hard.
We’ve refined a single golden elixir—
Though rocks crumble and rivers run dry, our nature endures forever."

I deemed it idle talk and laughed, turning to leave.
Just then, a carefree youth arrived, urging us onward.

The master said, “Why do you travel with an empty satchel? I have a pillow here—when folded, it measures no more than an inch, yet when unfurled, it stretches nearly three feet. Most convenient for the road. Would you like it?” I declined, saying we had only just met; how could I accept such a gift? The master replied, “Even strangers who meet by chance may share a moment’s intimacy, as the ancients did. Why refuse?” He reached into his bag and drew it out—a shape like folded bamboo, barely an inch long—and handed it to me. I accepted with thanks.

The master said, “The three-forked path made Mozi weep. Now you, too, are nearly lost. Shall I guide you?” He led me to a carriage, and we traveled a little over a *li*. Suddenly, the master vanished. Panicked, I pressed on another *li* or so, hunger and thirst gnawing at me. The carefree youth lagged behind, struggling to keep pace.

In the distance, a blue banner fluttered above a thatched eave, and a yellow bird sang near an apricot shop—this was an inn run by a woman of Wu. I wished to eat, but what of the coins at the end of my staff? I consulted the youth, who produced something he had found along the way. I said, “The Way does not tolerate theft; the Greedy Spring is shunned by the upright; a filial son avoids the village named ‘Unfilial.’ How could I, for the sake of my belly, commit such an unrighteous act?” The youth laughed and replied, “Refusing a coat is a trivial matter, but distrust is no virtue in an elder. Besides, in matters of life and death, to harm oneself over such scruples is to fail in filial piety toward one’s parents and loyalty to one’s lord. Loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness—these are all one and the same.” I heeded his words and, with reluctance, entered the shop.

I ordered a meal, but there was no rice left. I asked for it to be cooked, and the innkeeper soaked some millet to prepare it. Exhaustion weighed on my mind and body; I sought a pillow. The innkeeper apologized, saying none were available. I tossed and turned, restless, unable to settle. Then I remembered the pillow the Quanzhen master had given me. I took it out and unfolded it—over three feet long, soft and fragrant, perfectly comforting. With one pillow, I found peace.

I arrived directly in the capital and submitted my name at the prime minister’s gate. The next day, I entered the examination. The first session’s topic was *The Parrot’s Song*. My composition read:

In the second month, holding the essence of yang,
The chariot of Yifan appears in auspicious splendor,
Mountains and rivers nurture its spirit.
Emerald feathers drift across the azure sky,
Crimson mane stirs propitious clouds.
From distant lands it comes,
Reaching the maple palace of the court.
Eloquent and wise, it surpasses all winged creatures,
No envy for the phoenix of Zhou’s sacred ridge,
Freely soaring beyond the orioles of lofty trees.
It feasts on the celestial kitchen’s delicacies,
Sated with the emperor’s finest treasures.
Freed from its cage, it roams the four seas,
Soaring wherever it pleases.

The second session’s topic was a regulated verse on *The Peony*. My composition read:

The gentle breeze first stirs the yellow bird’s song,
Beneath the brocade curtains, its hues abound.
Dancing in the wind, its grace rivals Jin Gu’s gardens,
Dew-kissed and delicate, its emerald branches gleam.
White as dawn’s moon, it sheds its light powder,
Red as spring’s rosy clouds, veiled in sheer gauze.
Wealth and splendor it monopolizes—
Do not refuse to face it, drunk with flushed cheeks.

The third session’s topic was *Rhapsody on the Autumn Toad’s Shadow and Osmanthus*. My composition read:

The time is the eighth month, the season of metal’s softness.
Zhu Rong unyokes his chariot, the Quail Fire flows.
The qi of autumn presses upon the isles,
The White Emperor mounts his steed in the western realm.
The Water Sovereign responds to the tides,
The metal’s sound stirs the barren mounds.
The Silver River pours high,
The jade pestle’s notes linger long.
Its pure light illumines the nine wilds,
The clear hue fills the imperial tower.
It mirrors the mother-of-pearl gates of the limpid river,
Pierces the pearl-screened hooks of the shrimp.
Born of the night’s brightness,
It shatters the darkness of ten thousand ages.
Behold that vast orb,
Gazing back through a thousand autumns.
Its shadow sways in uneven grace,
Now vast and drifting, now sinking and floating.
Some cling to mud for sustenance,
Others wander with the pale moon goddess.
Then comes the *ding-ding* of axes felling trunks,
Suddenly the sound drifts downstream.
The steps ripple with light,
The jade palace coils like a dragon.
Now radiant, now dimming,
It gathers and withdraws.
Fragrance scatters, blossoms burst,
Like plucking clouds’ crowns.
A single branch, loftily grasped,
Soars the roc’s path at will.
Entering the pure void of Guanghan,
Lingering with Heng’e.
Jade pendants chime in pursuit,
Drawing the celestial winds of the nine provinces.
Facing the honored lord in toasts,
Clad in court robes and sable fur.
The examination concluded, the Minister recorded me as first,
Summoning me for an imperial audience.
I was bestowed palace flowers and a crimson robe,
Feasted in the Apricot Grove.
After passing, I strolled the grand avenues,
Where I encountered the daughter of Prime Minister Wen,
Who betrothed me to her household.
I declined repeatedly,
But the emperor transmitted his command—I dared not refuse.
Thus, I reluctantly complied.
Soon after the wedding, I was appointed Prefect of Yuzhou.
Accompanied by my wife’s family, I traveled by single carriage,
The road lined with well-wishers.
I upheld justice with unwavering resolve,
Never bending for personal gain,
Uprooting the powerful and ruthless without fear of the privileged.
Noble kinsmen withdrew their hands.
There was one notorious villain, long engaged in land seizures,
A leader of the *xia* underworld.
His gang of ten terrorized the prefecture.
Upon my arrival, they offered ten thousand gold as tribute.
I rebuked them, refusing even a thread.
Realizing they were outlaws, I summoned them for interrogation.
Within days, reports of their crimes numbered in the hundreds.
I ordered their arrest, but none dared act.
I secretly shelved the matter,
While the gang watched for an opening, attempting bribes.
I feigned friendship.
One day, I hosted a banquet for the leader,
Who arrived gleefully with his ten followers.
Before the wine had circulated,
I shouted—my attendants, a hundred strong, seized them all,
And they were silently executed.
Thus, the entire prefecture trembled.
After five years in office, I fathered two sons.
Upon returning to the capital for evaluation, I was ranked highest,
Promoted to Surveillance Commissioner,
Wielding the executioner’s axe without seeking approval.
From then on, I lived in luxury,
Adorning myself in fine robes,
Wearing the *zhiguan* cap,
My bearing surpassing all at court.
Onlookers dared not lift their gaze,
And I was called "Iron-Faced Lord Li."
While touring Xu and Yang provinces,
I captured thirteen thousand bandits,
Dismissed one hundred thirty corrupt officials,
And demolished over six thousand illicit shrines.
Wherever I passed, none failed to tremble in fear.
After another five years of inspections,
My eldest son, Yinlang, was nine,
And my second son, Chelang, was seven.
Upon returning to the capital,
The emperor’s countenance shone with delight.
He praised me with kind words,
Bestowed gold and silk beyond measure,
Hosted a banquet in the Wenyuan Pavilion,
And promoted me to Military Commissioner of Henan Circuit,
Ennobling me as Duke of Jing.
My wife became the Lady of Jing,
And my son was named Prefect of Yuzhou in title only.
After receiving my titles and passing the examination,
I feasted with the Wen family.
After three rounds of wine,
I could not help but think of my parents and Liu Shi,
Tears streaming down my face, unable to eat.
My wife inquired,
And I told her the truth.
She said, "What difficulty is there in this?"

The next day, I paid my respects to the emperor and presented my plea with sincerity, requesting a brief return to my hometown to visit my parents and bring them back to the capital to share in this prosperity. I also asked that Liu Shi be recognized as my primary wife. The emperor granted my request and bestowed upon me the privilege of swift travel by imperial post.

Returning to my homeland, I ascended the hall to pay respects to my parents and saw Liu Shi. Before I could even express my thoughts, local officials, old friends, and acquaintances filled the roads, their carriages and hats stretching as far as the eye could see. For over a month, there was no respite. Afterward, I tended to the ancestral graves, held feasts for all my relatives, and spent another month before formally requesting my parents to accompany me to the capital.

Thereupon, my entire family set out together. The journey took over half a month before we arrived at the capital and reached our residence. Lady Wen, leading our two sons, welcomed us joyfully. Upon entering the main hall, she first honored my parents with the highest seat and paid her respects. Next, Liu Shi was seated in the place of honor, receiving the full rites due to a primary wife. Then, my two sons were instructed to pay their respects to their grandparents and their legitimate mother.

A grand banquet was held, with music filling the hall and well-wishers arriving in succession. I shared a feast with Liu Shi to welcome her, and we rejoiced together in the same hall. With golden seals and purple sashes, we enjoyed all the wealth and honor the world could offer.

The emperor specially summoned my parents and elevated them to the titles of Duke and Duchess of Jing. He then urged me to assume my post. I departed the very next day.

A hundred *li* from my post, those who came to welcome me formed a forest of swords and halberds, clouds of banners, lightning-like armor, and ranks of soldiers and horses like scales. After residing at my post for over a month, just as I rejoiced in the peace and stability, urgent dispatches suddenly arrived: the Türks had invaded.

I hastily assembled thirty thousand troops, dividing them into two divisions, and marched out of Yu Pass, arranging them in the Nine Palaces Dark Lady formation. Li Ming served as the left vanguard, Shi Si as the right vanguard, Jia Chong as the scout general, Yuan Hongda as the left rear guard, Zhao Bi as the right rear guard, and Zu Sizeng as the central commander—all formidable generals.

Yet the Türks’ forces were overwhelmingly fierce. Li Ming advanced and said, "Commander, you must not underestimate the enemy. The nomadic cavalry excels in three strengths, while our forces excel in five. However, our five strengths are no match for their three. In the past, Emperor Taizong’s peril at the Muddy River could only be avenged by the courage of three arrows. Today, General, you should defeat them with strategy, as Jiezi captured Loulan or Ban Chao subdued the Western Regions. Victory can be achieved. If you rely on reckless bravery, I fear you will place a thousand *jun* upon a bird’s egg or drive a flock of sheep to chase a tiger—disaster is certain! I beg you to consider this."

I replied, "Have you not heard the maxim of military strategy? Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated. Know neither, and you will be defeated in every battle. The extraordinary becomes the orthodox, and the orthodox becomes the extraordinary. First ensure you cannot be defeated, then wait for the enemy’s vulnerability. To seize the initiative with a display of might—this is the mark of a great general. Do you truly believe I do not heed your words?"

Thereupon, I positioned the left flank in ambush in the southeast corner, with soldiers holding wooden bits in their mouths and horses with reins in theirs. I gave the command: "Hide at the sound of the gong, advance at the sound of the fire signal. Li Ming shall lead this."

"One flank shall form a battle array in the shape of a Black Dragon’s Swirling Tail, with Shi Si at the head and Yuan Hongda at the tail. If the head is struck, the tail shall turn to aid it; if the tail is struck, the head shall turn to aid it. They are permitted only to defend each other, not to pursue victory. When the Hu cavalry breaks camp, upon the first blast of the horn, retreat a hundred paces; upon the second, retreat another hundred; at the third, turn and engage in full force, then flee swiftly toward the southeast."

"When the central army fires three cannon shots, the ambush troops shall rise as one. Those who have retreated shall turn back, closing the encirclement to strike. Any who disobey this command shall be beheaded. The order was given."

First, a single weary soldier was sent bearing a letter to the Türks, setting the time of engagement for the hour of *si* on the day *ding-si*—the third day after the camp was established. On the second day, the flags at the rear camp suddenly fluttered northward, indicating spies had scouted the encampment. I secretly went to investigate and indeed found them among the undergrowth—thieves stealing horse fodder. They were immediately executed, their heads impaled on poles.

On the third day, *ding-si*, the battle lasted nearly an hour. As previously ordered, the Hu cavalry broke camp and pursued our retreat, falling into our trap. Five of their chieftains were captured, ten thousand armored soldiers slain, and their supplies and baggage heaped like hills. We returned in triumph, singing victory songs. The entire campaign lasted little more than ten days.

The report was submitted to the sovereign, who bestowed upon me a thousand-mile steed, a ceremonial robe with jade fastenings, a cart of gold and pearls, ten thousand *jin* of silver, a thousand bolts of brocade, and elevated me to the rank of Prince, granting me a fiefdom. After five years in office, my son succeeded me in the post. I then resigned my title to retire in leisure, sending my son to present a memorial to the throne. The memorial read:

The humble and unworthy Minister Lü Yan, Military Commissioner of Henan Circuit, respectfully submits this petition to beg Your Majesty’s grace for leave to retire and care for my parents:

I prostrate myself in awe and reverence, kowtowing to submit this plea. The boundless grace of Heaven blankets all things, and the sagely virtue of the Emperor nurtures and sustains all life. At the dawn of this propitious era, the Son of Heaven, responding to the mandate of the age, governs the world, while wise ministers assist in perfecting the Dao of governance. Yet it is said that loyal ministers are found in the households of filial sons, and those who serve their lord must first fulfill their duty to their parents. The Wei founder acted without principle, leaving Xu You to hold empty worth; the Han emperor, though benevolent, left Wang Mang with lingering regret. Such failures bring no solace to a minister’s heart and only diminish the ruler’s virtue. Let the past serve as a warning, and may the future take heed.

Now, by the grace of Your Majesty, who unites Heaven and inaugurates the era, upholding the world with compassion, teaching filial piety and loyalty, the proper order of human relations is restored. You perfect one’s role as parent and as child, and all virtues are thereby fulfilled. The ancestral temple receives the utmost sincerity, and the memory of the late sovereign is honored with lifelong devotion. The eight directions rejoice in reverence, and the nine provinces exult in harmony.

I, your humble servant, am but a lowly rustic, a mere blade of grass at a humble gate. In youth, I received my father’s teachings and secretly emulated the rules of Confucius; in adulthood, though unworthy, I was entrusted with military command and had the fortune to witness the virtue of Emperor Shun. My labors in service, like those of a warhorse, have been exhausted, yet the rites of caring for my parents remain unfulfilled. In my official duties, I have striven to devote myself entirely—how dare I claim my loyalty is complete? Yet the grace bestowed upon me is boundless, and I long to fulfill my filial devotion. I humbly beg Your Majesty to extend Your vast benevolence, which honors the aged and cherishes the young, and grant me the means to provide for my parents in their final years, like the lamb kneeling to feed or the crow returning to feed its parent. Thus, my sovereign’s expectation of service will not be hindered by my foolish heart, and the twilight years of my parents will have a place of refuge.

I am overwhelmed with gratitude beyond measure. I have instructed my son, Yin, to present this petition for Your Majesty’s consideration. The memorial is respectfully submitted.

May the Emperor not grant my request.

After serving another five years, I was promoted to Military Commissioner of Heyang, where I achieved repeated military successes. My son Yin was appointed to succeed me in Hedao, while I was transferred to serve as Prefect of Yuzhou. I remained in Heyang for eight years, during which both my parents passed away. Though the post was a critical frontier defense, the Emperor did not permit me to observe mourning. One day, urgent reports arrived that the Western Qiang had invaded, allied with the Nüzhen, their combined forces numbering eight hundred thousand. I was in the midst of my parents’ funeral rites when, after a single moment’s delay, the enemy reached the pass. I hastily dispatched He Yan to meet them, but he was captured and beheaded, and twenty thousand of our soldiers were lost. By the time I rushed to the front, the raiders had already fled. The court dispatched five Commandants of the Imperial Guard to bind and escort me to the capital, my wife and children unaware of my fate. I prostrated myself before the Emperor and recounted the circumstances in full. Moved by my past service, the Emperor inclined toward leniency—until slanderous ministers spoke against me, and my execution was ordered. As the blade fell, my spirit scattered ten thousand li, and my entire household was slaughtered to the last soul. I heard my family’s cries, and suddenly awoke—it had all been a dream. The millet was just done cooking. A carefree boy called me to eat, and so I woke.

Alas! A single pot of millet had simmered through thirty years of life—wealth and honor, sorrow and joy, life and death—all no more than this. After the meal, the boy urged me to depart. My heart wavered; I recalled the Quanzhen master’s words and wished to see him once more, yet knew not where he dwelled. I asked the innkeeper, “Have you ever seen a Quanzhen master with a full beard around here?” The innkeeper replied, “Not far from here. Take the forked road, turn at the grove of scholar trees, and walk half a li north—you’ll find a small hermitage. He never strays far.”

I turned back, but the boy resisted. I deceived him by saying I had left my pillow behind, and together we returned to the original spot. As we reached the scholar trees, the Quanzhen master was already seated beneath them; it was the hour of *shen*. He smiled and asked, “Why has the scholar returned?” I answered that I had come to return the pillow. The master said, “If you still wish to sleep, why return it so soon?” Just as I reached to give it back, he turned the pillow aside and fixed his gaze on me: “Do you wish to sleep beneath this tree?” The boy at my side did not want me to rest. The master pointed and said, “Why not take a brief nap while you wait for your master?” The boy promptly fell asleep.

Exhausted, I lay down and slept. Two youths in green robes called my name: “Come, come! Let us take you on a journey!” Unsure who they were, I looked closely and saw they resembled my childhood friend Jin You, and Zhu Jialang, with whom I had shared a bench in youth. I followed them into a pine forest, then through a cypress grove, where the rustling wind sounded like autumn leaves falling, and the stillness was as profound as a midnight road devoid of travelers. Towering bamboo and murmuring springs led us through winding paths into layered passes, up towering cliffs, and down to level ground, until we approached an official residence. Seated within was an official in black robes and a black gauze cap, flanked by attendants who summoned me forward. The official descended the steps to greet me and asked the youths, “Where have you come from?”

The youths whispered into the official’s ear, to which he replied, “Very well, very well.” Suddenly, he ordered a soldier—his body like Vajra, his eyes like those of a tiger or leopard, his voice like that of a wolf, clad in a dark green straight robe, a red sash at his waist, and a three-peaked hat upon his head—to lead me onward.

We arrived at a place where an old woman, her white hair cascading, held a porcelain bowl and offered tea to passersby. Parched, I wished to drink, but the youth in green stopped me. We continued on, traversing the River of Desire, its bridge no wider than a foot yet rising a thousand yards high, its waves surging, fish and dragons gaping as if to devour all. Some who crossed walked steadily upon its beams, while others were shoved or toppled into the torrent, where the creatures vied to swallow them. I turned away, unable to bear the sight.

Near the River of Desire lay the Lake of Blood, its stench so foul it could not be endured. Those who drowned here were all women—some with only their faces visible, others with breasts or bellies exposed, in countless grotesque forms. Some clutched young children, others cradled infants, their bodies suffused with crimson light, making them untouchable.

Beside the Lake of Blood stood the Knife and Block, where navels were slit, bellies split open, entrails torn out, and the victims pounded with pestles and mallets. I grieved and averted my eyes, but the green-clad youth laughed and forced me to look.

Nearby hung the Gallows, slightly less severe than the Knife and Block. Some were suspended by their hands, others by their feet, still others by both, their tongues lolling from the weight of stones, their eyes bursting from their sockets. They were flogged with thorned rods and lashed with whips, their cries of agony resounding.

The executioners took it as sport, like puppeteers at play. Near the Gallows stood the Mountain of Knives, its jagged peaks and sheer ridges bristling with blades and halberds, dense as spring bamboo shoots, their silver edges glinting. The guards drove the condemned up the mountain, stripped bare; those who resisted were beaten from behind with great yellow rattan cudgels, forced to crawl upward until their limbs split open and blood gushed forth like springs. I pitied them and begged for mercy, but the guards paid no heed.

Beside the Mountain of Knives lay the Grinding Stone, even more gruesome. The sinners were bound, the upper millstone lifted, and the condemned placed within; the stone was lowered, weighted with boulders, and the victims’ screams shook the earth. Two demons turned the mill while another prodded the flesh and bones with a fork, reducing them to pulp. Blood and pus flowed like slurry beneath the stone.

Nearby stood the Ox-Plow, where sinners were bound with their hands behind their backs. One demon seized their feet, two others pressed a great wooden beam against their backs, forcing out their tongues. Another demon hooked the tongue with an iron curtain rod and stretched it to over ten feet in length, then drove a calf back and forth across it. The tongue, two yards long and three feet wide, was plowed until it turned to mud. Those awaiting their turn were made to watch, their souls shattered in terror.

Beside the Ox-Plow bubbled the Cauldron of Oil, an iron vat like a great urn, filled with boiling oil and stoked with firewood. The sinners were bound only by their feet and lowered into the cauldron; they thrashed with their hands until a demon forced them under with an iron fork. In an instant, flesh and bone dissolved.

Near the Cauldron of Oil lay the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts, a pit holding thousands of sinners, their emaciated bodies no thicker than a span, their throats no wider than a needle. Their heads swelled like bushel baskets, smoke issuing from their mouths, their voices thin as mosquitoes, their forms like turtles or alligators submerged in water—one could not fathom what sins they had committed. The green-clad youth said, “These wretches craved the five pungent foods and the three forbidden meats, never satisfied in life, and so they suffer this retribution. Soon they will be reborn as maggots.”

Beside the Hungry Ghosts burned the Pit of Flames, a trench filled with glowing coals. The sinners’ clothes were stripped away, and they were hurled onto the embers. As they struggled to rise, demons pinned them down with iron rakes, searing their flesh until the stench carried for miles, lingering even a hundred li away.

Near the Pit of Flames stretched the Realm of Darkness, where even in daylight one needed a torch to see. Only the sound of weeping could be heard—nothing more.

Beside the Darkness lay the Realm of Wrongful Death, its walls enclosing countless souls bound by ropes, some missing hands, others feet, some headless or faceless, their forms grotesque beyond measure. All had died unjustly.

Beside the Realm of Wrongful Death stood Avīci Hell, the most dreadful of all. Its gates were barred by tigers, and ranks of ox-headed and horse-faced demons stood guard, allowing no glimpse within. The green-clad youth said, “By the command of the Lord of True Yang, I shall open it for you to see.” The ox-headed demon cracked the gate slightly, and from within came a surge of sinners, wailing and shrieking for help. My heart turned cold, and I turned away.

The youth led me to a hall where I first met the official. He tried to detain me, but I refused. The green-clad youth gave me a push, and I awoke. The master and the carefree youths were gone. The sun had set, and with no place to lodge, I searched for the original inn, but it had vanished without a trace.

The golden wheel of the sun’s chariot had sunk in the western valley, and the jade mirror of the moon hung over the eastern marsh. Before me lay no hostel like Mengchang’s, behind me no estate like Pingyuan’s. Caught between advance and retreat, I wandered, lost in thought. By the roadside stood an ancient pine, its roots gnarled, its branches spreading like a canopy. I leaned against it and sat.

I saw scattered stars like pieces on a half-finished chessboard, the Milky Way like a silken ribbon dipped in a river. A startled magpie cried from the nearby woods, and a few crows winged their way home over the high ridge. From a distant inlet came the creak of a fisherman’s boat returning; from a familiar village, the mournful notes of a shepherd’s flute. I looked around—desolate and alone, my shadow my only companion.

Suddenly, I thought of my parents, who had raised me with such care, always by my side. Now I was lost in this forsaken place, and they knew nothing of my fate. Tears streamed down my face, and I composed a song:

*I gaze at the distant mountains veiled in white clouds,*
*The winding waters of home cut deep into my heart.*
*In the high hall, white-haired, who will tend to them?*
*Neglecting my filial duties, my soul takes flight—*
*O clouds, O clouds, measure my longing across a thousand li.*

Then I thought of my wife, Liu, who had married me still a maiden. She served my parents above and lacked the comfort of children below. Her bed was cold and lonely—all my fault. I composed another song:

*I gaze at the empty valley where a fair one dwells,*
*Spring’s beauty in full bloom, our hearts entwined.*
*Parted like birds with severed wings,*
*I long to soar to the azure skies.*
*Yet in her youth, her mirror gathers dust.*
*Far from home, I shatter her spirit—*
*O song, O song, may the apes not hear my sorrow.*

As I finished singing, my grief deepened. Dark clouds gathered, and the bright moon lost its luster. After a long while, the mist rolled back, and the sky cleared as bright as day. From the southern peak, a white crane descended, its form vast as a wheel. Its cry was almost human as it alighted on the pine, bending its neck to peer at me—seeming to pity me, or perhaps to mock. Several more cranes circled and landed before me, dancing, their feet tracing patterns in the air. With a piercing cry, they joined my song:

*On the southern mountain, white clouds drift,*
*On the northern mountain, white clouds drift.*
*Gazing between them, the heart labors in vain.*
*When clouds gather, heaven seals itself;*
*When clouds scatter, heaven splits apart.*
*Gathering and scattering, parting and uniting—*
*All lies with the heart of heaven.*
*Solid or dissolved, what can man do?*
*Fix your eyes on these clouds,*
*Close them, and they vanish.*
*Parents and children are like these clouds—*
*Though you long to cling to them, you cannot.*

The crane nodded at me: *“Scholar, scholar, which parent does not wish it? But when impermanence comes, they cannot care for you, nor you for them.”*

The crane shook its head and sang again:

*Take that scorched paulownia, craft it into my zither,*
*Pluck its strings once—joy fills my heart.*
*Morning and evening, harmonious union,*
*Play but one tune—the phoenix’s cry.*
*By lamplight and moonlight, side by side we walk.*
*Vowing to grow old together, a hundred years as one.*
*Suddenly the strings snap—silence, soundless.*
*Though I long to play again, the music is not what it was.*
*The phoenix alights on the high ridge,*
*The mirror of the *luan*-bird shatters its water-chestnut frame.*
*Mortal couples are like this zither—*
*Heaven will seize what it will, not to be ransomed even with a thousand gold.*

Again it nodded at me: *“Scholar, scholar, which couple does not wish it? But when the day of fate arrives, each goes their own way. You will not see them, nor they you—where then to seek your spouse? Cut this binding cord at once, and seek for yourself the path of eternal life. When you reach that place, naturally parents and children, husband and wife will know no separation.”*

I was about to question its meaning when the crane stretched its wings, soared into the sky, and returned to the southern peak. The stars shifted beneath the moon, the cock crowed in Fusang, and dawn’s light stirred. My heart suddenly awakened—I no longer wished to press forward. The thought of fame and rank turned to ash, longing for home was severed, and I drifted with thoughts beyond the world, desiring to seek the Perfect Realization as my teacher. Retracing my steps along the old path, I came to the locust grove and sat for a while. There I met a wandering Daoist, his age nearing a hundred years, with snowy hair and bushy brows, clad in a tattered robe, straw sandals on his feet, and a staff in hand. I stepped forward to bow, and we sat together. He asked me: *“From what realm have you come?”*

Amidst the verdant willow grove ahead, a young servant hangs by his life from a high branch.” Startled, my face paled at these words—I knew it must be my runaway page. I immediately wished to go and see, but the Daoist halted, saying: *“Stay, sir. I observe your bones like a solitary crane, your face like spring blossoms, your beard like fresh willow shoots. A dark mole marks your brow, your mountain bones rise firm, your twin orbs gaze toward the sea, your five peaks stand full and proud. Your spirit is clear, your qi fresh—you are surely destined for immortality. Why not follow a master, receive the secret formulas, and seek liberation?”* I bowed deeply to receive his teaching.

The wandering Daoist smiled and said: *“For over thirty years I have roamed, yet never encountered a single true aperture. You should seek elsewhere—do not let this delay your own affairs.”* With that, he turned and departed westward, and though I called, he did not return.

I searched the willow grove and indeed found the boy hanging dead beneath a tree. It seems that while I slept beneath the locust, the master had already left. The boy called to me but I did not wake, so he kept watch through the night. When he realized I would not rise, driven by despair, he wept for me once, then hung my zither and sword in the grove before following me in death.

Alas! Before I could attain the Dao, I first brought ruin to a boy’s life—how can I bear this?

I gathered earth to form incense, bowed toward the empty sky, and swore an oath: *“If I should indeed meet an enlightened master who points out the path of delusion and confirms the mysterious Dao, I shall first deliver this boy. May the gods of heaven and earth witness my sincerity—let not this lonely soul drift far from its root. If I break this vow, may heaven and earth cut short my years.”*

When the oath was complete, I lowered the boy’s body, gathered mugwort from beside the willow roots to cover him, and placed the zither and sword at his side. With earth, I wrote upon the zither: *“To any traveler or dweller who buries this boy, these shall be your reward.”* Then I wept bitterly before taking my leave.

I returned to the locust tree to await the Perfected One’s return, but after two days, no word came. Each day I ate wild fruits to stave off hunger and drank from the stone spring to quench my thirst. My body grew gaunt, my form like withered wood; my feet could no longer walk, my eyes could no longer see. I lay prostrate at the root of the locust tree.

Suddenly, I heard the faint strains of a woodcutter’s song. I strained to listen—its melody was like a tune, the rhythm marked by the strike of an axe handle. The song went:

*“My home lies deep in the mountain wilds,
Axe in hand, I enter the forest thick.
I’ll fell a cypress a thousand years old,
I’ll hew a pine that’s stood ten thousand years.
I care not if he’s a hero or a lord,
I care not if he feasts on golden bowls.
Sometimes I gaze at the moon at zenith bright,
Sometimes I watch the clear wind on the ridge.
Sometimes I dig the white roots of poria,
Sometimes I pluck the red blooms of magnolia.
At dusk, I sleep on the mountainside—
All I gain is a carefree, easy mind.”*

The song faded into the distance. With great effort, I pursued the woodcutter to pay my respects. He asked, *“What brings you, sir?”* I inquired after the Perfected One’s dwelling. The woodcutter replied, *“None here, none at all. Beyond this mountain’s peak, down the other side, stands a dense bamboo grove. Within it is a small thatched hut, where a Daoist lives—jowly, bearded, wild-eyed, barefoot, with a great belly. We call him Master Jin. He’s a Perfected One who’s left the world.”*

I thought to myself: *“When I was still at home, that beggar spoke of ‘a hermitage in Mount Jinzhong.’ Could this be the same man?”* I begged the woodcutter to guide me. He exclaimed, *“Sir, you’re courting death! Why seek that rogue Daoist? Though he’s left the world, he’s fiercer than any layman. When merchants pass by with goods, he doesn’t need to do much—just a single shout, and they’re so terrified they look like little ghosts. The folk in these mountain villages must invite him to eat and drink at

The woodcutter spends his days gathering firewood among the mountain ridges,
Too lazy even to share a pillow with the white clouds.
He cares not for right or wrong, for all their topsy-turvy ways,
Nor for the thousand wiles of men,
Nor for the perils of wind and wave,
Nor for the hardships of the world’s long road.
When the mood strikes, he simply goes home—content—
While you fret and fuss, restless and unquiet.

The woodcutter was already gone. Exhausted, I sat upon a rock.
From afar, I saw a Perfected One approaching. Drawing nearer, I looked closely—it was not him, but the great bearded beggar from my hometown, now disguised in the robes of a Perfected One.
Sensing he was no ordinary man, I prostrated myself and bowed.

The man said, *“Ah, scholar, you’ve come this far—how bitter it must be! Why not stay at home? Above you, parents; below, wife, children, and servants. By day, fine meats and grains; by night, silken quilts. Why not live in ease? What possessed you to endure such hardship—no kin in sight, no food by day, no bed by night, soon to be devoured by tigers and wolves? Let me guide you back the way you came. What say you?”*

I bowed again and swore I would not return.

The Perfected One said, *“If not home—then what do you seek?”*
*“I wish to see my master in the Golden Heaviness Mountains.”*
The Perfected One pointed with his hand: *“Here he comes, here he comes.”*
Before my eyes appeared the potbellied, bearded beggar who had once come to my home, now also clad in the guise of a Perfected One, drifting toward us as if borne on the wind.
I prostrated myself upon the ground, but the Perfected One raised me with his hand. The two Perfected Ones exchanged words between themselves.
Then the latter one laughed as he looked at me: *“Coming so late as this—you will regret it when it is too late.”*
I swore again as before.
The two said, *“Since this is your resolve, wait here for us. We go but a short distance to seek a fellow Daoist, then return with you to the hermitage. If we do not come back, cross this mountain and look for a thatched hut on the knoll ahead—ask there for Master Golden Heaviness. Simply sit within the hut, and we will return.”*
With a flick of their sleeves, they left me and went on their way.

As dusk deepened, I could walk no farther and took shelter by the roadside. In an instant, fierce beasts roared, circling around me as if to seize and devour me. Collecting my spirit, I prayed in silence: *“Now, in my quest for life and death, I reck not of body or life. If these beasts hunger, let my flesh fill their bellies.”* A beast crouched before me, its eyes flashing like lightning, its voice thundering like a storm—after a long while, it vanished. Just as I closed my eyes, a bear sniffed at me, its fur scraping my face and brow. It seized my arm with its paw, then reached another into my chest, as if to tear out my heart. I prayed as before, and the bear released me and fled. The night passed without a moment’s peace.

At dawn, my stomach gnawed with emptiness, and my legs would not move. I dug up bracken roots to eat, and with some effort, pressed on. By midday, I saw a shepherd boy tending sheep. I asked how far the mountain hermitage lay, and he replied: *“Not less than ten days’ journey—five to the summit, and five more to the hermitage.”* Undeterred by the distance, I walked on. Parched with thirst, I cupped my hands to drink from a spring and accidentally swallowed a small water snake. My belly twisted in pain. Lying on my back by the stream, crows pecked at my eyes, hawks clawed at my chest, and ants gnawed at my feet. With a single unmoving heart, I endured the agony, though it was truly unbearable. Opening my eyes, I saw the shepherd boy laughing beside me: *“Fool, fool! Where do you think you’ll find Master Golden Heaviness? I’ll lead you back down. Your family awaits your return. Suffer like this, and by tomorrow you’ll have no life left.”*

"How could you ever reach that place?" I made no reply. The boy took a wheat cake from his bosom and offered it to me, but I refused. The boy said: *"Master, you still have ten days’ journey ahead. If you do not take sustenance, your life will be in peril—how then will you ever meet your teacher?"* His words rang true, so I accepted the cake and ate it, thanking the boy. As it went down, I felt my spirit clear and my qi swift; the pain in my belly vanished. I spat out the small snake—only to find it was a blade of grass root.

I bowed to the boy, then took my leave and pressed onward. Before I had climbed halfway up the mountain, dusk fell again, and no villagers were to be seen. In the distance, among the dark pines of a secluded ravine, blue smoke curled faintly; a yellow dog barked sharply. A thatched eave rose above a thousand ridges, and a wicker gate leaned crookedly over a deep gorge. Delighted to have found shelter, I went and knocked on the door. After a long while, a maidservant holding a candle emerged and scolded me: *"This is a village household. Our master is away—how dare you be so rude as to knock on our door?"*

I pleaded pitifully for mercy. The maidservant’s anger subsided slightly, and she bade me wait. After a moment, she led me inside. A vermilion gate swung open. Within stretched a vast hall of deep chambers, where prawn-shaped hooks hung high and beaded curtains screened peacock-feathered screens. Brocade cushions were spread in rows; aloeswood and sandalwood smoldered in jeweled censers, silver candles flared upon golden stands. As embroidered drapes parted lightly, a fragrant breeze wafted forth. Several maidservants in black led out a young beauty, nearly twenty years of age. Her willow-leaf brows trailed green; her almond eyes shimmered blue. Raven tresses coiled like the morning sun; her powdered face outshone the loveliness of the Luo River goddess. She bore the grace of the Chu palace and the bearing of the Wu kingdom.

She invited me into the hall. I demurred, reluctant to approach the inner chambers of such a noble house. The woman said: *"Since you have come here, it is a bond of three lifetimes, not something fixed in this one alone. You are a young gentleman; I am in the bloom of my years. Heaven has granted our union. Otherwise, how could I dwell in this secluded valley, neighbor to rocks and herbs, companion to deer and swine, where even woodcutters and herdsmen seldom come—let alone a gentleman like you? This is a gift of Heaven, not the work of man."* She called for her maids to prepare a feast.

I prostrated myself in refusal, repeatedly declining, but the woman’s star-like eyes flashed, her willow brows bristled, and her pomegranate teeth clenched. She ordered the maidservants to drive me out: *"Let this starveling scholar be food for wolves!"* I gladly withdrew, but as I did, her anger turned to insistence, and she commanded the doors be locked—though I wished to leave, I could not.

Soon, the feast was ready. She ordered me to take my place. I lingered outside the hall, refusing to enter. Several attendants lifted and carried me in, seating me to her left while she took the right. Before us, a hundred singing boys and dancing girls assembled. With each round of wine, a dance and song followed; the pipes, strings, and drums clamored in my ears, their sound shaking the hills and valleys.

First, they performed *"Cherishing the Hours,"* singing a measured tune. The lyrics went:
*Soft winds stir the brocade chamber,*
*Crabapple blossoms perfume the air,*
*Silken sleeves of dancing robes sway long.*
*A bird’s cry rings like pipes and strings,*
*Golden shuttles deftly cast among green willows.*
*Young nobles and ladies,*
*Wandering together to seek spring’s fragrance.*
*Where joy is found, there is the play’s stage—*
*Why seek the Way of immortals beyond this world?*

I leaned against the table, feigning indifference, though I committed every note to memory. Forced to rise, they next performed the *"Dance of the Eight Winds."* The melody followed the same form. The song said:

The small pond’s new lotuses, layered like coins, unfurl.
A balmy breeze first stirs the Yu strings,
while fireflies drift into the painted hall.
A single rain cools the bamboo mat for sleep—
I call a young maid to arrange cups and plates,
idly pouring fragrant wine in delicate streams.
Together we admire the scene:
man and moon, both full—
who would know that immortals walk this mortal world?

After three rounds, they danced *"Rainbow Skirts,"* the melody unchanged. The song went:
A crisp, cool breeze flutters lightly,
the well’s pulley creaks at the steps,
and the autumn cricket’s cry disturbs the chill.
Maple leaves on the crag outshine blossoms in red.
Wild geese in slanted formation cross the frontier,
while pure thoughts pair well with a full cup of wine.
The spirit of Red Cliff’s excursion rises yet higher—
a place for joy,
how often can one find it?
Speak not of Peng Zu’s aged frailty.

After four rounds, they danced *"Flying Swallow,"* the melody as before. The song said:
Six-petaled jade flowers swirl wildly through the vast sky,
beast-shaped braziers burn warmly without cease.
Wine is poured low, songs sung softly, lamb simmered—
we laugh to see plum blossoms open as the moon hangs on the branch.
Tapping sandalwood clappers,
dancing slender waists—
the joy of this world is true heroism.
Marten furs and golden belts adorn the mighty,
while we mock those who seek companions beyond the world among the mugwort and wormwood.

The women rose, lifting cups of wine in toast.
I did not respond and lay down.
Forced into marriage, I feigned madness in rage.
The woman said, “If you do not obey, blood may spill within inches.”
I smiled and replied, “One may live or die, but resolve cannot be taken.
Would I endure a fleeting pleasure to ruin great integrity?
I gladly accept the blade without protest!”
I stretched my neck, awaiting the blow.
The woman said, “A mad scholar indeed.”
Knowing my will could not be bent, she retreated to her orchid chamber,
leaving me in the central courtyard.
I still did not relax my guard,
fearing drunken sleep might bring disgrace.
I feigned slumber with closed eyes,
and she did not violate me for even a night.
A dog’s bark startled me awake—
I found myself in a pile of straw.
Was the vision of that strange night a phantom?

I pushed through brambles and thorns, climbing up the mountain stream.
After a mile or so, I saw a boy on a yellow calf descending from the layered peaks.
I asked him.
The boy told me, “Master Jin fell from the cliff in a violent gale ten days ago.
Crows and magpies have picked at him—
little remains of flesh and bone.
Where could he be now?”
Hearing this, I sighed in grief and sorrow,
ready to end my own life.
Yet hesitating, I thought,
“There are others with the same surname.
I cannot take this as certain.
I must go to the hermitage myself.
If he is truly gone, then I will decide what to do.”

Just as the boy turned past the gully, two or three more young lads emerged, each astride a yellow calf, forming a playful procession as they frolicked among the ridges, piping on flutes and singing songs. Their tune went:

*Up the mountain slope we ride,*
*calves our steeds, the wild our guide.*
*Green straw cloaks and turbans tied—*
*laughing blossoms plucked where peaks collide.*
*Here a gull on water glides,*
*there a cuckoo calls the rain.*
*Who would know the world’s cruel tides?*
*Day by day, our joy remains.*
*Carefree hearts forget all pains.*

When the song ended, they clapped their hands and burst into laughter. Another boy struck up a different melody:

*O’er layered peaks and humbled hills we roam,*
*barefoot, tattered robes left home.*
*Through pine shade we drive our calves to roam.*
*Stone springs quench our thirst alone,*
*wild tunes hummed to winds that moan.*
*Tender grass our bed, the sky our dome.*
*No chains, no bounds—*
*let heaven and earth drift as they may.*

Again they laughed. A third boy sang in the same style:

*By the crag, osmanthus blooms turn gold,*
*chrysanthemum scents the peaks unfold.*
*Cool winds stir the drifting clouds untold.*
*Eagles soar on wings so bold,*
*geese in ranks traverse the cold.*
*Moonlight like water washes cares away.*
*See a leaf-like sail on Xiang’s stream glide—*
*how many storms may toss the tide?*

When he finished, the four boys gathered in a circle, playing bamboo flutes together. Pointing at me, they giggled and teased, saying, *"What kind of fool are you? Abandoning your home to wander lost in these wild mountains. You must be a madman, out of your mind!"* With each remark, they laughed anew. Then another boy began to sing:

*Their tune went:*

Behold us delighting in these mountains,
laughing at those who topsy-turvy remain—
clutching wealth and rank as idle burdens,
stirring only vexation and care,
stirring only sorrow and strife.
I urge you: cast them away.
Shatter the snare’s scheme,
and only then may you escape life and death.

The four boys sang as they laughed, walked as they sang, then vanished in an instant. I strained to see, but they were gone. Gathering my robes, I pressed onward—already the sun hung low at dusk. Though I stumbled in pursuit, I could not catch them. Turning in every direction, I searched.

Then, atop a sudden rise, on a level stone sat two village boys. Their yellow hair fell to their shoulders, ragged clothes draped their frames. One cradled a handful of stones and two baskets; the other held a stone board, spinning pieces upon its surface. Startled, they stood and bowed in fear.

By then, the moon crowned the pines, bright as daylight. I crossed my legs beneath a sprawling cypress and sat. Soon, two elders arrived with coughs and sighs, settling beside the stone to arrange their stone pieces for weiqi.

One elder called to the yellow-haired boy: “Child, do you know weiqi? Let me tell you of the game.

Weiqi mirrors heaven and earth,
embodies yin and yang’s mutual conquest,
spins in ceaseless transformation,
completes its measured course.
Wield the spirit’s scheme in profound stillness,
birth cunning and skill among peers.
Seize the corners with four or five stones,
claim the borders with slanted plays.
Cast the heron’s long legs,
trap the turtle’s withdrawn head.
A lone army’s deep thrust—
guard against flank-striking pawns.
Troops arrayed in ranks—
require high ramparts and deep trenches.
Illusory eyes: do not treat as live land.
Severed shapes: abandon as dead.
Do not advance and lose your rear,
do not lean right and drift left.
Do not covet bait and lose the fish,
do not indulge in joy and forget sorrow.
To break a formidable foe,
first settle your own strategy.
Open the gate, charge the formation,
watch for gaps to steal in.
Let divine schemes render you unfathomable,
let hidden wisdom make you hard to fathom.
Pursue the plan of ten thousand certainties,
beware the greed for petty gains.
One move amiss—
the whole board is lost.

Like a person in the world,
like a game of weiqi at play:
spread wide, and black and white stretch in every direction;
gather in, and valor and might hide away.
A hundred years pass no swifter than one game,
ten thousand affairs return to a single scheme.
Gaze upon the board and reflect—
I urge you, sir, turn back soon.”

As he finished, I stepped forward to ask a question. The two elders brushed their robes and strode off; the boys gathered the board and followed, vanishing into the distance.

As I stood there in bewilderment, suddenly a great whistle rang out from the northern hollow—like the howling of wind through trees, like the surging of a mountain stream. Two towering black-clad men came charging toward me, their shouts fiercer than Xiang Yu’s, their presence more fearsome than Chiyou’s. One seized my hair, the other my body. Alas, I had no purse! The robbers laughed: “We’ve lurked here for years, but never crossed paths with such a penniless wretch. No money, no clothes—what a waste of our time!” The shorter one grumbled, “I can’t stand this!” Drawing a hemp rope from his waist, he bound me without a word, trussing me like a dumpling in meat. Then they hoisted me high into an ancient juniper, clapped their hands in a triumphant whistle, and vanished into the dense woods.

At that moment, I had no path to heaven above nor earth below, nor any hope of rescue. My limbs burned with pain, and I fainted twice over. Wailing to the empty air, I composed a poem:

*For immortality I sought the Red Pine’s trail,*
*Through brambles and thorns into the mountains deep.*
*How oft my parched throat found the stream’s cool grace,*
*Yet all day my hollow gut knew no grain’s fill.*
*My shoes, worn thin, met jagged peaks’ cruel bite,*
*My tattered robes could scarce withstand the wind’s embrace.*
*Who knew that after dangers past, new perils would arise—*
*Now dangling from this ancient tree, my life nears its last trace.*

I wailed aloud, then fell silent to recite the verse again. Suddenly, a cough echoed from the boulder below. I looked down to see the old weiqi player, gazing up at me with a smile as he chanted:

*Your frame hangs like a withered branch, your body gaunt and frail,*
*Yet fate still tests you with these brutes so cruel and hale.*
*The ropes entangle you as spiders weave their snare,*
*Your shadow sways like a butterfly lured by scent’s sweet trail.*
*They’d have you curl like hedgehog or mantis in retreat,*
*While their wolfish hearts unleash their savagery complete.*
*The flying teal has yet to master life’s elixir true—*
*Why must they shrink your world before its time is due?*

I pleaded for his help. The old man said, “These bandits are vicious—challenge them, and we’ll both be done for.” I begged again. At last, he lowered me down, untied the ropes, and rubbed my limbs, where the bindings had cut deep. Only after a long while did I revive.

“What brings a scholar like you to such a place?” he asked.

I told him my purpose.

“Ah! Ah!” he exclaimed. “You’ve gone astray!”

That Master Jin bears the name of a renunciate but not its truth—by night he debauches women, by day he plunders travelers. Those two brigands just now were his accomplices. Seeing him come flying after them like that, I knew his wicked impulse had flared, so I followed at a distance to this spot. Sure enough, he was up to his tricks. Had I not intervened, you’d have been left dangling till death. Now you’d best take advantage of the dark to find your way back and save your life—wouldn’t that be best?”

I replied, “My resolve is already firm. Unless the eastern mountains crumble to dust and the southern seas run dry, I will not give up my search for my master. Death comes to all in time—that is why I have come here. If I waver now, Heaven and Earth will surely hold me to account. I would rather die than turn back.”

The old man laughed heartily, left me, and returned the way he came. I sat and waited for dawn, then climbed once more toward the mountain’s peak. Near midday, I saw smoke rising from the treetops and heard the crowing of roosters. In the distance, a low wall of whitewashed plaster enclosed half a cottage, where three boys drew water. I approached to beg for food.

There, along the level terrace, stood several tables in a row, all occupied by scholars. One asked, “From what quarter does this friend hail? Your robes are disheveled—have you suffered the hardships of Chen, or perhaps encountered the blades of Kuang? Please rest a while and take some tea.” They invited me to the seat of honor. I demurred, but at last sat down.

The tea arrived—clear, cold, and fragrant, its savor one I had not tasted in over a month. When I had finished, a young scholar spoke, asking me the reason for my journey. I answered truthfully. The others covered their mouths and snickered, saying, “Sir, since you have studied the classics, how can you be ignorant of the great principles? Confucius said, ‘To attack what is heterodox is to invite harm.’ To depart from Confucius and embrace the heterodox is to harm oneself. To spread such teachings to others is to harm the world. Mencius said, ‘Of the three forms of unfilial conduct, the greatest is to leave no descendants.’ To be without father and without lord is to be no better than a beast. You have abandoned what you have learned to follow heterodox ways—forsaking your parents is unfilial, forgetting your lord is disloyal, severing the bond of husband and wife is immoral, casting aside friends is faithless, and disregarding the order between young and old is disorderly. You have corrupted the Five Relationships; how then can you stand in heaven and earth as a member of humankind? Moreover, from Pan Gu to the present, how many have not died? How many have achieved immortality? Consider the flower: if there is glory, there must be withering. Consider the arm: if it stretches, it must also bend. Heaven and earth themselves wax and wane; mountains and rivers themselves change. We are but one thing among many—how can we transcend heaven and earth to exist alone?”

Then all the scholars joined in unison, urging me to stay and pursue the same path: “This place is scarcely a hundred li from the capital. In ten days, the great examination will be held. Go forth and win rank and office—would that not bring greater joy than wandering beyond the world?” I gave no answer but took my leave. Though they pressed me to stay, knowing my resolve could not be shaken, some offered a kerchief, others a pair of shoes, but I accepted nothing. Lightly I departed, and after half a li, I turned to look back—no trace of them remained.

That day I reached the summit’s end. Lifting my gaze, I saw on the opposite peak’s flank a small hermitage, and my face lit with joy. Descending along the mountain’s back, weary from the climb, I rested beside a bamboo grove. There flowed a stream, its jade-green waters carrying the source of Kunlun, its silver springs issuing from the celestial branches. Chrysanthemum fragrance assailed my senses, rivaling the beauty of Nanyang; peach blossoms rode the current, like guests on the banks of Wuyi. Clear enough to wash one’s cap strings, deep enough to feast the eyes—I cupped my hands and drank.

A fisherman rowed toward me in a fragrant orchid boat, singing as he came:

*I steer a light, light skiff,
Push a floating oar so swift,
Don a small, small straw cloak,
Toward a winding, winding brook.
Roaming free, roaming free—
On the sand, mandarin ducks entwine their necks,
Bathe their feathers in the limpid stream,
Call and fly past willow banks so green.*

He sang a verse, struck his oar a few times, and rowed past the western bend. Then another song:

*On both banks, lotus coins lie stacked,
Waves like flying snow attack,
Fish at play in the water’s track,
Butterflies dance round the bank’s slack.
Who cares if the midday sun burns bright?
On the waves, a cool breeze brings delight.
Joy unbound—
Gently I ply my orchid oar,
A marvelous sight!
Wandering, I cannot bear to rest.*

Again he rowed toward the eastern bend. Another song:

*Dense hibiscus lines the shore,
Brilliant knotweed blooms galore,
Hear the lone goose cry on Xiang’s far floor,
Hear the village’s cold mallet’s roar.
Most lovely when moon shines bright,
Moon shines bright—
The flute’s notes chase the clear stream’s flight,
Osmanthus fragrance drifts in the night.
A golden cup raised high,
Drunken eyes in clouds and waters lie.*

He rowed his boat past where I stood. Another song:

*A biting north wind rises,
Willow fluff lightly flies,
Jade petals strew the ground in white surprise.
The Jiang and Han rivers shrouded deep in cloud,
A fisher’s pole feels winter’s chill so proud.
How can one sigh for the lamb’s bold might?
The lamb’s bold might.*

In the warm chamber, fair maidens gather in joy—
I ponder:
How can their brocade robes compare to my tattered garb?
Mine is far finer.

I bowed and begged the boatman to ferry me across the stream.
The boatman asked, “Where are you headed?”
I replied, “To Master Jin’s hermitage.”
The boatman pointed and said, “Follow this creek past the bend, then turn up the hillside. The main path will lead you there.”
With that, the boatman rowed downstream.

Following his directions, I indeed found the main path. After walking about a *li* along the slope, I saw a tousle-haired boy descending the hill. Clad in a black robe, he held a begging bowl and chanted the name of Amitābha. Knowing he was from the hermitage, I bowed and asked after the master’s whereabouts.

The boy said, “The master was bitten by a snake while gathering herbs. He lies bedridden in the hermitage, his life hanging by a thread.”
Hearing this, I felt both joy and sorrow. Taking leave of the boy, I hurried straight to the hermitage.

Suddenly, no one was in sight. Fallen leaves piled beneath the eaves, withered branches stretched across the path. I pushed them aside with my hands, my fingers torn and bleeding, my palms stained crimson. Reaching the hermitage, I found the wicker gate tightly shut. I knocked for a long while, but no answer came. After a pause, I knocked again. From within, a cough sounded:
“Hmph! What rude mountain brute dares disturb my humble abode?”

“I am but a poor Daoist, my clothes barely covering my body, my food lacking in flavor—what could I possibly possess to provoke your intrusion? Be gone at once and seek your livelihood elsewhere!”

I called out, “Master, Master! It is your disciple, Lü Yan.”

“For decades I have lived here alone as a renunciant—where would I have taken a disciple? I do not know you.”

I called again, “Master, Master! On the road to Handan, you once bestowed upon me a bamboo pillow. Among the pines, you made me a promise. I have come especially to seek you out.”

The master let out a roar: “You foolish scholar! Had I made you a promise, why did you delay until now? In searching for you, I was bitten by a snake on the toe. Now the rot has spread nearly to my thigh, the pain unbearable, my life hanging by a thread—all on account of you, you wretch! Now you arrive—what use is it? Go back, go back at once! Your parents are aged, your wife and children still young. The court has just opened the southern selection—begone, begone!”

“Unable to bear my suffering, I fell to my knees outside the gate, wailing and weeping bitterly: ‘Master, if you will not take me as your disciple, I shall hurl myself from the cliff and die. What a pity—after enduring a thousand hardships to reach this place, only to play out a meaningless farce. Master, have mercy!’

The master fell silent for a long while before barking, ‘Are you not feigning sincerity?’

‘If I am false in my heart, may Heaven strike me dead.’

‘Very well. Gently push open the wicker gate.’

Before I could lift my hand, the door swung open. Inside, I saw only a clay bed and a tile pillow, no mat or blanket. The master lay prostrate, the walls bare, with neither table nor stool, nor pot nor stove. He called me forward: ‘What a fine disciple! Just when I had no one to attend me. You’ve come at the right time—come, come, and tend to my wounded foot!’

I lifted the hem of his straw robe to look: the stench was unbearable. One foot had rotted into a pulp of flesh, the leg already festering, maggots writhing thickly. I brushed them away with my sleeve, scooped them into my lap, and scattered them outside the hut hundreds of times before it was somewhat clean. Yet the sight of his rotting foot pained my heart deeply.

That night, the master bade me sleep at his feet. I made no objection, tending to him step by step. He cried out in pain all night, while I sat and soothed him.

The next day, the master said, ‘Disciple, for ten days the pain has robbed me of all appetite, but today I feel hunger gnawing at my belly. Go and find me something to eat.’

I gladly accepted the command.”

I stepped out of the hut but knew not the way. When I first arrived, there was a path, yet now, searching again, I could not find it—all was overgrown with brambles and thatch. I knew not where to turn, nor dared I ask the master, fearing I might rouse his anger. Lifting my head, I prayed to heaven: *"Disciple seeks food for his master—may the mountain spirits guide me to a path!"* Suddenly, I spied a narrow trail, just wide enough to walk where no grass blocked the way. Following it for several *li*, I came upon a small hamlet, where an old woman stood at her door. I begged her for food, and she gave me a bowl of rice.

I hurried back, and by the time I returned, it was already the *shen* hour. From afar, I heard the master shouting and cursing from within the hut, railing about hunger: *"Where did this wild savage come from, with no place to stay, pretending to be a disciple—thinking I have something worth stealing! He left at dawn and has not returned till now, no doubt feasting himself full, with no care for his sick master. When that wretch returns, I’ll drive him out at once!"*

Muttering curses under his breath, I rushed to the bedside, knelt, and explained what had happened. The master fell silent, ignoring me entirely. After kneeling for half the time it takes to cook a meal, he finally snapped, *"Bah! Bring it here for me to eat."* I cupped my hands and offered the rice, but with no chopsticks, I had to pick it up with my fingers to feed him. His eyes flashed with rage as he roared, startling my soul from my body: *"You savage—how dare you be so insolent! A sick man like me, forced to eat such coarse rice, and you don’t even wash your hands before feeding it to me. What kind of reckless fool are you? What sort of ‘home’ did you leave to become this way? Go, go at once—or I’ll beat you with my staff!"*

With tears in my eyes, I pleaded, *"Master, forgive this disciple’s offense. Let me go seek better food. But this place is deep in the mountains, with few households—only a handful of poor villagers within ten *li*, not a single wealthy family. Where could I find white rice?"*

The master said, *"I’m too furious to eat. Just go—don’t make trouble here!"*

I pleaded again and again, *"Allow this disciple to serve until the master’s illness is cured—then I will gladly depart. Let me go once more to seek food to fill the master’s hunger. I beg the master to calm his anger."* The master finally fell silent.

Following the same path, I went to beg for food. By good fortune, I came upon a wealthy household, its gates shut tight. I knocked until they opened, only to be met with a torrent of abuse from the gatekeeper, who threatened to strike me. I pleaded pitifully. After a while, an elder emerged and asked what had happened. I explained the situation. The elder smiled faintly and said, *"You fool—if you’re starving, that’s your own misfortune. Why should your master’s hunger concern you? Are there no other monks in the world? If he scolds you, go elsewhere and find another master. Why persist so stubbornly?"*

I bowed deeply to the elder and replied, *"A loyal minister does not serve two lords; a chaste woman does not take two husbands. In ancient times, Chen Xiang was rebuked by Meng Ke for abandoning his teacher, while Li Si was condemned by Confucians for betraying his roots. Even Chen Ping remembered his debt to an unknown benefactor, and Zengzi could not bear to replace Confucius with Master You. Great righteousness outweighs petty resentment. Moreover, the rites of serving a teacher demand labor and devotion—how could I dare turn away?"*

The elder, finding my words reasonable, gave me a bowl of fragrant white millet rice and told me to eat. He also gave me another portion for my master. I refused to eat first, as the master had not yet taken his meal. The elder insisted, so I gratefully accepted. After bowing in thanks, I returned, only to find the moon already filling the thatched window. The master was still shouting curses at home: *"Leaving the door unlatched at night and still not returning—what a savage heart you have!"*

I entered and first reported to the master, *"This disciple’s hands are now clean, and I have obtained white rice. Please, master, take your meal."* The master opened his eyes, and at last, a hint of pleasure crossed his face. *"Give it to me,"* he said. I fed him with my hands, fearing he was too hungry, and offered it to him repeatedly. With a sweep of his hand, he scattered it all to the ground, cursing, *"You barbarian—do you mean to take my life? I’ve been ill for so long, my throat is parched and narrow. How could I eat so quickly? Yet you keep shoving it at me!"*

I explained, *"I feared the master was too hungry and meant no harm. I beg the master not to be angry. There is still half a bowl left—please, master, eat."* For a long while, he said nothing. Then he finally snapped, *"Bring it to me!"* I fed him slowly. With another shout, he struck the bowl away, sending the rice spilling to the ground, gnashing his teeth in fury: *"I was just about to eat, and you deliberately slow down—you’re clearly trying to torment me!"*

He raged on until midnight, then barked, *"Won’t you pick up that rice from the ground and eat it clean? If you don’t, it will all be your fault!"* I humbly assented, kneeling to gather and eat every grain.

The master, peering through the moonlight, smiled and said, *"Well gathered, well gathered—now that is a true disciple."*

Since eating the scholars’ tea and rice, I had not felt hunger. Arriving at the hermitage, I was famished, but as the master had not yet eaten, I dared not eat first. Now, after gathering the scattered rice from the ground, I found myself strangely full.

The master said, *"Disciple, tomorrow fetch some water to wash my feet—be early."*

At the fifth watch, I took leave to draw water, but after searching the entire mountain, found none. At a ravine’s mouth, I saw a pool, yet had no vessel to carry it. Using my alms bowl, I scooped a bowlful and returned to the hermitage by noon. The master flicked his hand, spilling it to the ground: *"I told you to go early. Now you bring water at midday—how am I to beg for food? Forget washing. Go beg instead."*

Another night passed. He called for water again. I set out at the fourth watch and returned only at dawn. The master scolded, *"You witless, ailing fool! My feet require a whole vat to wash—would you use this eating vessel for such a task?"* Again, he dashed the water to the ground.

I pondered in vain, then said to the master, *"I have no vessel to draw water, nor one to wash your feet. What if I carry you on my back to the ravine and wash you there?"*

The master hesitated, then replied, *"Very well, but carry me carefully—my feet must not be jostled."*

I helped him lean against my back, cradling his legs in my arms. Four times I stopped to rest. At the ravine’s edge, lowering him proved difficult, so I first knelt, then lay down sideways, easing him to the ground. His rotting thigh rested against mine as I scooped water with my hands, gently wiping away the decay. The foul flesh washed clean, the stench lessened. The master sighed in relief, and I, too, felt joy.

After washing, I carried him back. By late afternoon, as we neared the hermitage, a fierce wind arose—sand flew, stones rolled, the pines roared like raging tides, the ravine echoed like a battle cry. The master trembled; so did I. Suddenly, from the bamboo grove, a thunderous crack split the air as a white tiger leapt forth, its form like a water buffalo, charging toward the master.

I quickly set him down and threw myself over him, pleading to the tiger, *"Eat me instead—spare my master!"* My wails shook the heavens. The tiger paused, then slowly retreated. The wind stilled, the sky cleared. I carried the master back to the hermitage and laid him on his bed.

He turned to me and said, *"Now, at last, you understand my heart."*

The next morning, his feet were healed, and he could rise. One day, he led me to Pine-Plum Ridge. There, pines stood evergreen through the seasons, plums bore the grace of a thousand years. White cranes soared in rivalry, colorful *luan* birds danced in pairs. Fragrant breezes stole upon us, radiant beauty unfolded—another world entirely.

We sat cross-legged on the open ground, the master and I. Knowing my familiarity with letters, he asked me to compose a poem on the pines. I answered at once. The poem read:

A steadfast soul has long embraced the cold-season’s resolve,
Through endless frost and ice, unbending, never swayed.
Its verdant needles cluster, nourished by the rain’s caress,
Golden pollen sifts like fragrance, scattered by the wind’s embrace.
Roots twist through hidden earth like creatures in deep hibernation,
Its voice pierces layered clouds, roaring like a raging tide.
I charge the woodcutter’s axe: spare wanton felling—
Wait and see it rise as pillars for the halls of heaven’s court.

The master said, *"What you have composed speaks of its use, its outward form, not its transformation. You have yet to grasp what makes the pine the pine—its unyielding integrity, its steadfast constancy. It may offer warmth, it may offer cool, it may endure the snow, yet its rooted foundation remains unshaken. It seizes the essence of heaven and earth, gathers the radiance of sun and moon. Through ages untold, it yields *fuling* from cinnabar caves, works divine wonders among cliffs and peaks, and endures as long as heaven and earth themselves. With the passing of generations, it thrives in lush verdure, soaring to the skies, piercing the clouds—how could its greatness be confined? This is why the pine is revered above all other trees. Do you understand?"*

I bowed my head in acknowledgment and received his teaching.

To compose on the plum, I wrote this poem:

It does not follow the crowd in warm currents,
But on the ridge, its nature remains serene and secluded.
Its fragrant essence drifts unseen on the wind,
Its jade-like form faintly floats in the moonlight.
Where its scent grows rich, birds steal away to slumber;
As its blossoms seem to take flight, a flute leans against the tower.
Turning back, all other flowers retreat in deference—
Who dares vie with it for precedence or claim kinship?

The master said, "Indeed. Yet the plum’s distinction among common blossoms lies still deeper. Aged upon its branches, it blooms anew with spring’s return. With ice-like flesh and jade-like bones, it endures the cold without fading. Not only can it not be transplanted elsewhere, but its original branches never rot or decay. Through rebirth and renewal, its lineage never perishes. Precisely because it does not flaunt lush beauty nor indulge in extravagant display, but delights in seclusion to nurture its innate nature, it stands as companion to the pine and bamboo, while all other flowers and common blossoms fall short.

You—like the pine’s steadfast strength and uprightness, unstained by dust, bearing *fuling* that forms solid fruit; like the plum’s refined elegance and tranquil seclusion, untempted by crimson and purple, with roots firm and seeds yielding jade censers—will not merely rise above the common, but attain everlasting life, shed your form and husk, and become a perfect essence between heaven and earth."

I heard this and closed my eyes in silent contemplation. After a moment, all cares dissolved, every thought emptied. Inwardly, I beheld a clear vision—spirits manifesting, yet I knew not how. The master called, "Awakened?" I replied, "I have just entered this state, still lingering in imagination, unaware of where it leads." The master gave a faint smile and said, "If you know not where it leads, where will you seek its origin? Recall Confucius’ teaching to Zilu—when you enter a state from without, there is still a point of departure. To seek its origin is to find your own unformed self."

As we spoke, the sun sank behind the western crags, and the moon rose over the eastern ridge. The master said, "Let us return." I followed him.

Returning to the original hermitage, I found the overgrown thickets cleared, the path smooth and unobstructed. Upon arrival, a young attendant opened the door to welcome us. Gazing at him, I recognized the same boy I had met descending the mountain when first entering the valley. Inside the hermitage, all furnishings—utensils, bedding, and mats—were renewed, no longer mere earthenware or tiles.

The master sat cross-legged on the couch, while the boy lit incense on the table and served mountain tea. He bade me sit behind the master, facing him. After tea, the boy took up a jade flute and played, its notes like the phoenix singing in the parasol tree, like jade pendants chiming in the Milky Way. Three melodies later, my spirit felt refreshed, all worldly cares dissolved.

The master instructed me to close my eyes in deep meditation, to harmonize the bellows of the heart, to breathe with the void, to turn the Celestial River within the primordial pivot, to revolve the earth’s axis in yellow mud. He taught me to open the twelve mist-laden gates, to traverse the nine winding paths—three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter, not a hairbreadth amiss; the sixty-four hexagrams, each one unfolding into eight, not a single measure awry. When summer came, winter departed; when winter departed, summer came—each rooted in the other. At the extreme of movement, stillness returned; at the extreme of stillness, movement arose—alternating in ceaseless flow.

His guidance now clear, the practice became familiar. For one hundred twenty days in the hermitage, I sat in unbroken meditation, fed only dates and chestnuts, drinking only dew, until I forgot sleep and hunger altogether.

One day, the master said, “Your qi is now full. The turbid has dissipated, the pure has congealed; the human has departed, the celestial has returned. Will you leave this place? Go home to visit your parents, then return.”

I knelt in distress, bowing my head: “Master, why speak thus? Why speak thus? Your disciple harbors no such thoughts. My ties to the world are severed, all worldly affairs resolved—why should I return?” The master only smiled and said no more.

Ten days later, he took me to wander in Emerald Void Cave. We climbed steep slopes and jagged peaks, where perilous cliffs and towering rocks stood amid pines and cypresses, deer and cranes gathered in flocks, and purple mushrooms and jade trees intertwined along the path. A fragrant breeze stirred, and songbirds trilled—another realm entirely. How wondrous to behold!

At the summit, a level terrace appeared, with stone benches and tables, clouds and mist forming its curtains, the surrounding peaks its screens. The master and I sat upon the benches, lingering over the view. He asked, “Have mortals ever seen this?” I replied that few had.

The master said, “Two of my teachers once promised to meet me here, so I have brought you along to wait with me.”

Before long, from the depths of the pines and cypresses to the southeast, white cranes appeared, dancing ahead as guides. Two attendants in blue robes followed, bearing whisk brooms, and behind them, two masters. The first had tousled, unkempt hair, large eyes, and a bushy beard; he wore a black robe tied with a brocade sash, his face dark, his ears large, his body stout and tall. Lame in one leg, he leaned on an iron staff, appearing about fifty. The second was gaunt as a crane’s bones, his hair white, his complexion ruddy; he wore a white robe over a blue gown, an angular cap on his head, and a green silk sash. In his hand he held a ruyi scepter and seemed over seventy. Both wore straw sandals, their forms drifting lightly toward us.

We exchanged bows. The lame one took the seat of honor, the master the second, the elder the third, and I was told to sit beside them. I bowed again, asking their names. The lame one tugged at his beard, laughing loudly: “Do you recall the tale of King Ling of Zhou whipping his mother’s grave?” Then I knew him to be Li, the Grand Historian. Only then did I realize this place was truly a realm of immortals.

A spike struck my crown, and my dreaming soul stirred slightly. I bowed again to the three masters. The elder said, “I was born before the Grand Historian—Zhang Guo of Bohai Prefecture.” I kowtowed once more in deep reverence.

Li said, “Do you know who your master is?”
I replied, “Master Jin Zhong.”
All three burst into laughter, clapping their hands. Li said, “Your master is none other than the Han general Zhongli Mei.”
Only then did I realize that *Jin Zhong* was *Zhong*. Overjoyed beyond measure, I thought: all that I had once heard and recited in tales, I now beheld in person before my very eyes.

The master Li said, “This student is a scholar from Jingzhou. Yet even in the moment of begging alms, he failed to awaken—and now he has endured the toils of years. Have you resolved your mind? I fear that if you falter later, regret will turn to sin.”

I awoke further. The three beggars remained before me, their faces unchanged, though their robes were transformed. Rising, I bowed my head: “With these mortal eyes, how could I recognize the assembled masters? For my past transgressions, I can only beg the heavens’ forgiveness.”

The master smiled: “Now we are one family—what blame remains?” We sat again.
“Li and Zhang wish to discuss the Dao with me. Let us hear your thoughts.”

Li spoke: “We and you, fellow sojourners, lodge our traces in floating dust, our forms in clods of earth—hardness not equal to metal, rootedness not equal to trees, liveliness not equal to rivers and deep pools, steadfastness not equal to Mount Tai. Borne along by the wild horses’ tumult, no more enduring than mayflies in their rising and vanishing: such is our general condition.

As for the stirrings of joy and anger, sorrow and delight, they do not match even a flower’s bloom and withering. The vicissitudes of poverty and success, gain and loss, do not match even a season’s shift from cold to heat. Fame and rank turn like a palm’s reversal—graves and mounds, like a palm’s covering—and all too soon, in a flash, they settle beyond reckoning.

Thus, in terms of form: heaven and earth are my greater, while I am heaven and earth’s lesser. In terms of mechanism: the cosmos is but a single breath, while my body is breath unceasing. To know the body’s unceasing breath is to surpass the cosmos’s ceasing breath. To know what ceases, and to know what does not cease—then my body is heaven and earth, heaven and earth are my body, one becomes three, three becomes one. The great is no longer great, the small no longer small, formless and mechanism-less. Thus it has been for ten thousand ages.”

I rose and inquired into the doctrine of the unceasing. Li requested our master to speak. Master Zhong said, “Listen well, disciple.” With a flick of his palm-leaf whisk, he intoned clearly:

The river’s pulse lies in its source—
no pause in its mechanism,
flowing day and night.
Mighty waves surge from Kunlun’s spring.
No brook is left behind,
flooding all nine provinces.
Bearing the celestial virtue’s grace, no seep nor leak.

This root, discerned in stillness,
is one spring and autumn through ten thousand ages.

Master Zhang struck the fisherman’s drum, rapped the bamboo clappers, and joined in harmony:

Each has its source—
behold it,
flowing on the river’s course.
Luminous pearls roll from Floating Bridge’s spring.
A hundred channels like brooks,
nine bends like provinces.
Stored in the fields, let none be lost.
This root, unblocked, is made alive—
a ceaseless torrent, knowing no autumn.

From his seat, Master Li brandished his ruyi, struck the stone with a resonant *clang*, and joined in:

The ancestral qi is the pass—
issuing from the true source,
flowing day and night.
Pity the long-blocked spring!
Mud clogs these brooks,
filth chokes those provinces.

After several breaches in the unformed vessel’s leaks,
this root, now pierced through from this day forth,
unfolds in one unbroken autumn’s flow.

The Master asked, “Little one, do you grasp this?”
After a meal’s span of insight, I replied, “I have glimpsed it.”

Masters Li and Zhang said, “If so, you may compose in the same rhyme, that we may gauge your depth.”
I bowed deeply, stood in attendance, and joined in harmony:

On the river’s course, turn not back—
passing thus, like this,
an unbroken stream.
Now the mechanism’s aperture is breached.
Dredged channels, cleared brooks,
linked rivers, opened provinces.
The vast, surging torrent—how could it leak?
Having grasped the root,
its limpid depths run clear,
enduring through ten thousand autumns.

Master Li rejoiced greatly, saying, “This child may be taught, may be taught indeed.
Now I ask you—whence have you come?”
I answered, “From the place of coming.”
He asked, “And what is there?”
I said, “Luminous and unceasing.”
Master Li laughed, “Luminous and unceasing—what is it that moves in this?”
I had no reply.
Master Li said, “Listen to my words:”

Where was the trace ever found in the first place?
Two and five congeal to form the harmonious body.
At sunrise, a single red gleam from Fusang’s boughs—
a thousand groves of splendor planted in Shangyuan’s gardens.
The aged clam’s bright pearl—how could it have a seed?
The lofty terrace’s precious mirror—yet holds no form.
How many fair and foul images are cast forth,
while the serene realm remains utterly empty.

What is real belongs to him; what is illusory belongs to me.
What exists belongs to him; what is nonexistent belongs to me.
What is stirred by feeling belongs to him; what is still and unmoved belongs to me.
Yet if there is this “me,” there must be that “him.”
Without “him,” one becomes a mere thing, a dried gourd.
Without “me,” one becomes a planted pattern—where then are all these scattered things?

Thus, he must be himself, and I must be myself;
he cannot be dispensed with, yet he does no harm.
I remain utterly unmoved,
while he devises a thousand schemes and a hundred snares.
Yet I sit in solemn dignity, like the great sovereign enthroned in the ninefold palace—
what comes does not depart; what departs is entirely his.

Recognize the path of what comes,
and the path of what goes will not err:
from the original place it comes, to the original place it returns.
Thus, to come is of me, to go is of me—
who could restrain me?
To ascend to heaven is by me, to enter the earth is by me,
to be small is by me, to be great is by me—
who could bind me fast?

Now, the people of this world come by this very path.
At first, they have not gone far and still recognize some of its signs.
But as they press on into vast realms and crowded places,
they forget entirely.
If they turn back in haste, they have not strayed too far.
Yet they know not that along the way, countless enticements
dazzle the eye and beguile the heart,
luring them by day and drawing them by night.
They rent a dwelling, amass gold and treasures,
and just as they settle into a household,
the six thieves scale walls and burrow through holes,
devising every cunning scheme to steal away their wealth,
not ceasing until their home is stripped bare.
Reduced to destitution, their house in ruins—
by day, the light wind whistles through the door;
by night, the fine rain drifts past the window.
Walls collapse, beams crack, pillars snap.
Those who once beguiled them now abandon them,
leaving them nowhere to rest.
Seeking the original path to return,
they find only boundless, indistinct places—
how could they recognize it?
Helpless, they drift east and west,
settling wherever they may,
heedless of good or ill, comfort or hardship,
content to lay down their burden and be done.
Even then, debts and enmities drag them down,
no one in the east will take them in,
no one in the west will keep them,
while the south reviles them.
Suffering in a thousand ways, utterly wretched,
they can only seek shelter in a haystack or a crumbling wall,
each step leading them further astray,
so far from their origin that it might as well be the Central Plains—
never again will they find their way back.
How pitiful, how pitiful indeed.
All this is the harm he inflicts, the ruin he brings.

Thus, I must take command of myself,
seek out the source of my coming—
this is to return to the root and revert to the origin,
to return to the clan and restore the ancestry.
Heaven and earth are my dwelling,
yin and yang my husband and wife,
sun and moon my lamps,
rivers and lakes my cups,
the eternal mountains my clods of earth,
wind and clouds my unfolding,
rain and dew my saliva—
how did it begin?
How will it end?
From whence did it come?

Whence does it go?
What is life?
What is death?
Surveying Qin and Chu, observing the gains of rivals,
glimpsing the foolishness of Chiyou and Xiang—
all this is but a laughing matter.
What then of gain and loss?"

I asked, "May I dare inquire what method brings one to this state?"
The master replied, "The techniques differ, and so too their returns to the origin.
One must interweave and cross-examine,
seeking the utmost, the most profound, the subtlest, the deepest—
only then is it refined.

Let me explain to you:
Those who dine on pine needles and consume elixirs
cannot swiftly transcend;
life and death are fixed in their breath—
how can they forget form?
Focusing on the hundred meridians,
visualizing the cinnabar field,
regulating breath to a thread—
yet the fetal state remains unformed.
Holding breath and concentrating thought,
perceiving the profound silence of the primordial—
still, in the end, they fail to ascend.
Those who take the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female
are like wind trapped in a net.
Those who regard the square inch as the heart’s field
see the ancestor but forget the clan.
If one accumulates essence as celestial lead,
the cinnabar and mercury remain incomplete.
Treating spirit and qi as mother and child,
the terrace of immortality lies far beyond.
Opening the crucible for refinement,
labor is spent in vain;
refining mercury and balancing tortoises—
these are but perverse and deluded arts.
Three years, nine cycles—
how can the firing time suffice?
Holding breath to absorb the primordial,
the yin wind howls in response.
Those who recognize mind and see nature
may have a head, yet end as spectral beings.
Sitting at midnight and noon—
though this is effort, it is but rigid and constrained mystery.
Is the tongue truly the Crimson Dragon?
Eyes closed like a fox’s breath—
the crown as the Yellow Court,
the kidneys as creation—
mired and unpenetrated.
The tail palace as life,
the foot apertures as the source—
substance without transformation.

More still: consuming water and fire to return to the origin—
the path of error grows ever wider.
Absorbing essence through dual cultivation,
the road of entry strays further.
Gazing at the heavens to draw in the essence of sun and moon,
disregarding celestial soul and earthly spirit—
a single meal spanning day and night,
only to invite emaciation and frailty.
Curving the body, lying prostrate,
knocking the five gates to sound a long cry—
what benefit is there?
The Way of inner cultivation lies in guarding the primordial and embracing the One.
Turning the twin pupils inward to reflect—
this too is not the near path.
The gate of the oral formula:
raising the shoulders, craning the neck,
circulating the spine’s flow—
the hundred meridians may open, yet one aperture remains dim.
Inscribing talismans, chanting incantations,
pledging contracts in clear words—
the hundred evils may be dispelled, yet one spirit is obscured.
Worshipping the Dipper, gazing at stars—
labor spent in vain, no aid to sighing.
Massaging and pressing, practicing arts—
what merit in such methods?
The talk of exhaling turbid and inhaling pure is crude;
the discourse on eating plain and fasting is base.
Holding registers and performing rites,
setting up altars—
all devoid of virtue.
Using bellows and keys to gather essence and coalesce spirit—
only to fall into the path of transgression.
The ancestral qi of the primordial
does not reside in form, image, or imitation;
the sacred medicine of the Great One
how could it depend on smelting lead or refining mercury?

Transcending the realms of the multitude,
awakening to the formless within the formless;
entering the Mysterious Pass,
discerning the auspicious within the existent.
Unfolding the lotus within fire,
drawing forth the pearl from water.
In the cauldron of dragon and tiger,
no need to seize—naturally subdued;
in the furnace of tortoise and snake,
no need for forging—silently refined.
In movement,
true stillness without motion;
in emptiness,
firmness without void.
There is something prior to heaven and earth,
formless yet within the unshaped embryo.
A voice in the valley echoes through a thousand mountains;
waves on the river stir a hundred seas.
So many afflictions—
unrelated to these myriad endeavors,
heedless as withered wood.
Yet when spring dew touches the withered,
it revives like dead ashes;
when fire and wind scatter the ashes,
one recognizes the magpie’s chariot ascending layered heavens.
The fluid of the jade elixir congeals in the Crimson Palace.
Why must the Yellow Dame mediate marriage?
Why must the Infant be nurtured to completion?
Drawing from Kan to fill Li,
mending the torn patch of the monk’s robe;
Qian revolves, Kun turns—
rebuilding the crumbled walls.
Those who probe the Mysterious Pass of a single aperture
cling to deluded views;
those who point to the nine-fold elixir method
hold shallow discourse.
Riding the golden ox to roam the eight wilds,
reversing the Yellow River through the three barriers—
all are but dust with traces,
not the supreme vehicle of the formless.

Within the twelve hours, it is qi;
within the chest, it is spirit.
If one merely wanders among a hundred paths and thousand byways,
in the end, one flows into the realm of gods, demons, and ghosts—
able to seize a vessel, yet also to be reborn.
Nine revolutions, ten transformations—
if one can transcend the mundane,
then one can enter sagehood.
A single surge spanning a thousand leagues—
know that refining stone can mend heaven,
then believe that ascending clouds enables transformation.
This living, vibrant thing,
like a rolling pearl upon the earth;
this radiant, luminous thing,
outshining the bright moon in the sky.
Unmired in stagnation,
unobscured by dimness—
seeing through the mechanism of the aperture,
leaping beyond the gate of life and death.
Heaven and earth share my rise and fall,
the cosmos my duration and transience.
Unbreakable, unseverable,
unscorched by fire, undampened by water.
Though the seas overturn and rivers surge,
the heart does not dance, the spirit does not stir.
This is the most profound mystery,
yet not a matter of many techniques.
One’s own affair must be sought by oneself—
to ask another is already error.
Coming by one path,
going by one path—
to stray elsewhere is to lose the way.

You have affinity; how could I remain silent?"
Having spoken, two youths bore platters of fruit, nuts, and wine cups,
arranging them upon a flat stone.
I bowed in gratitude for the instruction and bade him sit again.
Gazing upon the spread:
peaches like great bowls,
lotus roots like flat boats;
the pears of Hebei surpassing,
the jujubes of Jiaozhou exceptional;
melons large as cauldrons,
oranges brimming with chess pieces.
As if simmering dragon’s liver—yet the flavor more exquisite;
as if stewing phoenix’s wing—yet the form unlike.

The crane’s breast needs no preparation,
the phoenix’s embryo forms not in smoke;
the ape’s lips require no ape,
the leopard’s marrow no leopard.
Jade nectar, liquid gem—
seeping into amber and glass;
mushrooms of hemp, essence of greens—
their savor brushing the azure vault and jade firmament.

After long toasts, white cranes and green phoenixes danced in flocks,
their rises and falls keeping time,
their bows and lifts measured.
Gracefully they passed beyond the eight ridges,
their harmony surpassing the seven virtues.
When the dance ended, they stood in ranks to left and right.
Several green-robed youths arranged themselves below,
beating time as they sang.

The first song:
The two qi breathe in and out—
the valley echoes with sound.
Sweeping a thousand mountains’ fallen leaves,
parting the nine deserts’ gloom.
Seek it—no shadow;
observe it—no form.
Suddenly still,
suddenly present.
Not to be bound by traces,
nor easily companioned on the way.
Not swift yet swift,
not present yet numinous.
From the dense grove it lifts its head;
from the roaring tiger it springs to life.
Opening my robe in one sweep,
I feel my thoughts refreshed, my spirit clear.

The second song:
Receiving the radiant qi of Heaven and Earth,
it flourishes in spring’s fullness.
Receiving the Craftsman’s artful touch,
it charms in bright clarity.
Adorning a thousand reds and a hundred purples,
it vies with the branches’ rare blossoms;
nurturing pure fragrance and graceful essence,
it exhales a heart of rich perfume.
Though wild bees madly dart,
its essence remains unbroken;
though wanton butterflies swarm,
its truth is not lost.
Its root and stem stand firm,
bearing fruit again and again.
Through years and months it endures,
lifting high through frost and dew.

The third song:
Like the two qi’s subtle blending,
the myriad things transform in harmony.
Pervading all with clarity and peace,
above and below in profusion.
Spanning the six directions in flight,
unlike wild horses’ headlong rush.
Covering the nine lands in shelter,
unmoved by carved jade’s splendor.
Scattered, it needs no restraint;
gathered, it takes form.
Refining yin’s spirit to fill the space between,
transforming yang’s spirit—none know where it abides.
Wondrously shifting, never fixed,
delighting in temple halls and tavern signs alike.
What makes this flesh and bone?
Only silver pheasant’s plumes and crane’s feathers.

The fourth song:
Holding this yin essence,
it reflects the great yang.
Bright and unwavering,
radiant with light.
Like a dragon spitting a jewel,
rolling forth from the Milky Way.
Adorning the mid-heaven with constant brilliance,
its pure glow alone shines.
No thing remains unillumined—
like a treasury of wisdom to discern right and wrong.
No place is left untouched—
like a sage’s jade dispensing kindness.
Enviable, that single spark in the spirit’s terrace,
through ten thousand ages unchanged.
Though waxing and waning, it never ceases,
awakening this benighted world.

When the youths’ songs ended, they played the *Xiaoyaoyue*.
Golden sheng, jade pipes, phoenix flutes, dragon xiao,
silk se zither harmonizing with ice strings,
jade clappers keeping time with flower drums.
The high notes soared like cranes crying over the nine marshes,
piercing the layered clouds;
the low notes flowed like ten thousand ravines’ fine streams,
cascading through deep gorges.
At times slow—like Yao pacing, Shun stepping,
bowing and yielding in the ancestral hall;
at times swift—like a single ox or feathered rider,
racing through the ranks.
Sometimes swelling in unison—
like officials arrayed at court,
daring not overstep before the Son of Heaven.
Sometimes restrained, stepping in measure—
like a vast herd at pasture,
when all things revive yet scales and tails still pause.

Then the cranes stretched their necks to join,
the phoenixes flapped their wings and sang,
the phoenix tuned its tongue to sound,
the parrot cleared its throat to follow the rhythm.
Listening intently, one felt the spirit soar and the heart sway,
drunk with joy, forgetting the vastness of heaven and earth,
blurring self and other in shared delight—
beyond words.

When the music ended, the two cranes stepped forward, raised their heads,
and spoke in song, voicing Daoist sentiments.
The lyrics said:

The Azure Cloud Hermitage, far from the bustle of towns and courts,
where fine dust never rises—truly secluded and serene.
A thousand emerald cypresses stand among golden osmanthus,
a few jade-flowered trees interspersed with crimson peaches,
while fragrant breezes swirl around the lotus pool.

Behold the ancient steps layered in tiers,
phoenix-tail ferns entwined with sacred lingzhi,
and jade-like herbs carpeting every path.
Flowers bloom in all four seasons, never fading,
while thousand-year pines stand firm and proud.
Amid such scenes, countless vistas unfold,
and joy overflows like wine.

Again they sang:
A shallow stream, a humble bridge,
where jade-like pearls tumble from cliffs into the ravine,
crimson clouds dazzle, adorning the mountains in splendor,
a bright moon, full and round, hangs at the ridge’s peak,
while birds sing in the branches and human traces vanish.

Behold the stone benches beneath pine shade,
where pebbles are tapped in rhythm,
oblivious to thirst or hunger.
In the empty sky, kites soar in formation,
on calm waters, dragons coil and glide.
Here, boundless delight unfolds—
true freedom at last.

The song ended, and with several cranes, they flapped their wings,
leapt and stretched their necks, circling left and right,
bending low and rising tall—
a thousand postures, ten thousand forms.
After their dance, they let out a piercing cry,
their voices shaking the nine marshes,
halting the flight of clouds,
resounding through the heavens,
leaving one’s heart unbound and spirit soaring,
mind clear and qi flowing.

The Three Masters drank deeply from great goblets,
their hearts open in mutual toast,
as the hours passed—
unaware how many days and months of the world had slipped by.
When cups and plates lay empty,
and dishes were nearly bare,
Li and Zhang spoke:
“Today’s gathering was to open a passage for Master Lü.
You may transcend, you may transform—
come with us now,
do not linger through the years,
lest you miss the appointed time.”

Master Zhong assented in agreement.

Li and Zhang turned to me and said, “Hold firm, hold firm—awaken swiftly, awaken swiftly. We await you.” Then they mounted their cranes and departed westward. I gazed after them in longing, heart gladdened that they had joined the immortals’ journey. Yet my master had not taken me along, and this weighed heavily on my mind.

The master said, “The two gentlemen have gone. Why not return to the hermitage with me? Was today’s gathering joyful? Can you find joy without clinging to joy, and ease without being troubled by sorrow? Can you meet without attachment to meeting, and part without resistance to parting? Bless them as yourself, bless yourself as them—then their joy is your serenity, their sorrow your repose. Those who gather are bound, yet you remain free; those who scatter are lost, yet you stay unburdened. This is the solid within the empty, the empty within the solid. In every word and deed, you must not let a single moment slip by.”

I received his teaching and returned to the hermitage, where I served him with unwavering devotion. My reverence was single-minded, my devotion earnest, ever renewed and flourishing. By day, we discussed secrets beneath the shade of pines and bamboo; by night, we delved into the profound through silent contemplation, glimpsing the true face of our original nature and shattering the illusions of the Three Mysteries and Seven Thieves. From the depths of a ten-thousand-foot abyss, a pair of eyes and five tigers leapt forth; within a pit of fire, nine golden lotuses bloomed. A pearl rolled across the plate, six swords unsheathed from their caskets. Chaos gave way to the first stirrings of life—budding, restless, then settling into clarity, the muddy waves stilled. Neither being nor non-being, neither emptiness nor non-emptiness—truly, all actions are but phantoms, while radiant truth lies in stillness. Before the puppet stage, strings are tugged in vain; in the foundry’s hands, iron and bronze are melted to no purpose. The tangible is false, the formless is real. Here, a flake of snow flies in the furnace’s fierce blaze, a hair of ice descends into the boiling cauldron. The house is left behind, empty—several times I roamed the six directions; walls stood in vain—countless somersaults carried me to the Three Terraces. To exist is to be spirit; to think is to transform. No need for search, no labor for conjecture.

Knowing my practice had reached fulfillment, the master called to me one day: “The formless has already revealed itself. The formed is yet to be known. Return along the ancient Way to the old homeland. Once, in Puyin Village, you met my master and vowed to become a carefree youth. Now he has fallen into an inauspicious path—you must teach him the secret method, guide him back to the mountain, then swiftly return to the hermitage. Do not let worldly dust entangle you or obscure the road ahead.”

That day, he entrusted me with a whisk and a begging bowl. I received them, bowed in farewell, and rode a pure wind straight to Huoshui Village. There, I transformed into a mendicant Daoist, wandering the roads. After a day of searching, I learned my parents had passed. Only Liu-shi remained, having kept her chastity as a nun; the family home had become a Daoist abbey, where she and a few elderly nuns chanted sutras before the bodhisattva’s image. I entered directly, and the nun scolded me: “This is a convent, a pure and precept-bound sanctuary. How can a male Daoist simply barge in?”

I bowed my head in apology and addressed the assembly: “This poor Daoist comes from a distant mountain wilderness, ignorant of proper conduct, and has trespassed upon your sacred abbey. Yet as fellow renunciates, when a monk comes, you see the Buddha’s face. I have no clothes to cover my body, no food to fill my stomach, and few acquaintances in this world. Seeking refuge in your abbey, I humbly beg for alms of clothing and food. Within ten days, should I encounter a generous patron, I will repay your kindness and return to my mountain. I implore you to open the gate of universal salvation, to magnify the virtue of delivering others—do not turn away this mountain dweller. Your compassion will be deeply felt.”

The chief seat glanced at me and ordered the manager: “Give this Daoist a liter of alms-grain and send him on his way to find lodging elsewhere. Though this is but a small abbey, it is a private residence, and moreover filled entirely with women—how can we accommodate a man? It would not be proper.”

I refused the alms-grain and made a bow to the chief seat: “Venerable one, venerable one, I came to this sacred abbey for a reason. If you will not permit me to stay, and I am given alms-grain, who will cook it for me? If you would but lend me a young brother to keep me company, I will leave at once. If you refuse, I will remain here and never step outside for a thousand years.”

Hearing this, the chief seat flushed crimson and flew into a rage, cursing: “This wild Daoist is utterly without manners! This is a sanctuary of the Buddha’s disciples, a pure Dharma-gate—how dare you spout such nonsense here! You are no madman who has lost his senses, yet you utter such reckless words. If you do not leave at once, we shall deal with you by the Dharma’s principles.”

I laughed and said: “Fine nuns, fine nuns—you speak of leaving the household and purity, but where is your purity to be seen? You have not even renounced the south, yet you presume to become Buddhas? Listen to what I tell you: that Amitābha is no trifling secret.”

"To begin the work, one must first extinguish the nameless. Hold fast with a heart as unyielding as iron; let not even a trace of male or female stir warmth in it. Gather and extinguish all joy, anger, sorrow, and delight of the mortal world; sever all ties to clothing, food, and bodily needs in this dusty realm. Then, even if right and wrong, strength and weakness contend and trample, or blades and cauldrons of boiling oil assail you, my wisdom-eye and Chan heart shall remain unmoved—this is the supreme secret of attaining Buddhahood and ascending beyond."

Hearing this, the chief seat bowed her head for a moment, then stepped down from her seat and prostrated before me, saying, "This humble nun’s fleshly eyes failed to recognize your loftiness. I beg for your instruction."

I asked, "Venerable sister, in what year did you leave the household? How many years have passed since?"

The nun replied, "I was once the wife of a scholar. When my husband left to seek official rank and never returned, my parents-in-law and parents passed away, leaving me alone to keep my chastity. With a few like-minded companions, I have practiced the Way at home for several years now."

I said, "Would you, venerable sister, leave the household under my guidance?"

She answered, "How could a woman follow a man? Such conduct would invite reproach. My heart is as steadfast as stone—do not take this as jest, noble one, but instruct me in the Chan principle. If you insist on such stingy teaching, I shall take my leave at once, lest you sow doubt and disrupt my pure precepts."

I said, "Venerable sister, since ancient times, who has truly attained Buddhahood? Among women of the world, the fortunate ones marry a husband—some ride in grand carriages, wear purple robes and golden belts, dwell in perfumed chambers and embroidered pavilions, delighting in morning joy and evening pleasure, honored with golden seals and purple decrees, living as ladies of rank and enjoying glory; others amass gold and jade, adorn themselves with pearls and treasures, feast on rare delicacies, celebrate every dawn and festival, called *yuànjūn* or *māma*. What could be more blissful than this? Instead, you forsake a fine match, squander your youth, eat plain gruel and tasteless rice, wear coarse robes and tattered garments. In the desolate gate of emptiness, you dread the howling wind and rain; in the bleak, cold chamber, you sorrow at the dripping water-clock. In the tender beauty of spring, you weep as you watch others break hairpins and play games; in the scorching heat of summer, your heart aches as you listen to songs in the cool pavilion. The autumn wind soughs, and you resent the migrating geese; the winter snow drifts, and you grieve over your iron-hard quilt. After enduring such hardship, in old age, you will have no children to see you off in death. Of the countless who leave the household, not one has become a Buddha. Why not return to the world? I shall not leave it—how does that strike you? How does that strike you?"

The nun, having heard these words, flared into a great rage, and barked at the attendant to drive the Daoist out and bolt the convent gate. I thought to myself: *My words have angered her—how then shall I help her transcend the mortal coil?* So I transformed myself, entered the sutra hall directly, and with a flick of my whisk, incense smoke curled and celestial blossoms rained down. The attendant hastened to report to the nun: “That Daoist was just shut out, yet now he stands in the sutra hall, whisk in hand, sending incense aloft and flowers cascading.”

Startled, the nun emerged and said: “Immortal brother, pray do not display your numinous powers to disturb this disciple. This disciple is resolved unto death, with no other thoughts. I beg you to take your leave elsewhere.”

Perceiving the sincerity of her heart, I said: “Liu Gu, would you like to see your husband?”

The nun replied: “My husband has been gone so long—whether he lives or has died, I know not. Even if he were to return now, I would never again consort with him as a mortal. If he comes, I shall have him choose another fine match; I vow never to meet him again.”

I laughed and said: “This poor Daoist and your husband both left the household under Master Jin Zhong. He has already attained the right fruit and descended the mountain with me. If I bid him come to see you, you may look—he approaches from behind.” The nun turned her head. I then revealed my true form. When the nun looked at me again, she stood in silent loss, her numinous radiance now visible, and bowed to me, saying: “My husband has already attained the Dao—why not deliver me as well?”

I reached into my pouch and took out a single elixir, bidding her to swallow it. Then, with the tip of her tin staff, I traced a crane and commanded her to mount it. Suddenly, Master Zhong’s voice rang out from midair, halting us to await his decree, and the crane reverted to a staff.

I imparted a gatha:
*At midnight, the heavens raise a gleaming moon;
In the third winter’s furnace, jade snow takes flight.
The finest nectar fills ten thousand acres of fields—
No mundane flame need melt the śarīra.*

Hark!
*Three lives were not the Husband-Watching Stone—
One kick sends you soaring past Heaven’s Gate.*

Having inscribed the gatha, I brushed my robes and departed the nunnery. Arriving at the ancestral burial grounds, I inquired of the mountain spirit. The spirit reported that my grandfather, grandmother, and mother had all ascended to the immortal realm and were no longer recorded among the ghosts. Delighted, I returned to Pu Yin Village.

When I was still more than ten *li* away, I sought alms among the village households, inquiring after their traces. An old man with flowing white hair leaned on his staff by the door, sighing ceaselessly, his sorrowful countenance plain to see. I clasped my hands in greeting and begged for alms. The elder asked: “Where does the master come from?” I told him of my quest for alms.

The elder pointed toward the village ahead: “Master must not take that shady, overgrown path—there is something strange there, so terrifying to speak of. At times it takes human form, at others the shape of tree branches, or of tigers and wolves, or of ghosts and specters. Sometimes it appears as a woman to lure young men, sometimes as a tavern to entice travelers to drink, sometimes roaring like thunder shaking the valleys, sometimes leaping like a dragon surging from the deep. Its transformations are endless, its malevolent forms myriad. Those who encounter it are ground to powder; those who meet it are shattered to pieces. Roughly like the willow twig of Liu Wo, it has claimed no fewer than a hundred lives. If no passersby are to be found, it seizes men and women from nearby villages, young and old alike, throwing households into panic and disarray. No law can restrain it, no talisman subdue it—who would not fear it? Before, my youngest son was herding sheep when it ensnared and devoured him whole. Master, you must be on guard. Should you meet this demon, your life will be no more, your body obliterated, no different than if you had ascended in feathered transformation. What can you do, Master?”

Upon hearing this, I reproached myself deeply. This was my fault—I had brought this sorrow upon them, this harm upon all. My Dao remained unfulfilled, yet I had first wrought calamity; my merit remained unaccumulated, yet my sins were already complete. What words could I offer in my defense? Fortunately, my master had guided me here, and there was still time to avert future disaster. Otherwise, the harm would only grow more severe.

I bid the old man farewell and set off toward the dense forest. He called after me several times, but I did not respond and pressed onward. After roughly a *li*, a sudden gale erupted, whipping up sand and dust for ten thousand miles, uprooting towering trees, with the force of overturning mountains and upending seas. My feet could not stand firm, my body could not remain upright—I knew the demon had begun its work. I swept my whisk several times, and the wind subsided. Soon after, a black mist enveloped all, connecting heaven and earth, blotting out sun and moon, obscuring mountains and rivers. Day became as dark as the deepest night; even faces before me were unrecognizable. A thunderous roar grew louder, closing in upon me. I swept my whisk again, focusing my spirit with full intent. The mist dispersed into the empty mountains, the clouds returned to the vast sea, and clarity shone once more.

After another *li* or so, a pack of jackals and wolves suddenly charged forth, jaws gaping and fangs bared, intent on devouring me. I raised a finger and shouted, *“Cease! Do not be so insolent!”* The pack of jackals and wolves turned out to be but a few willow branches. As I examined them, a deafening crash resounded—the southern mountain split at its peak, the northern ridge shattered the layered heavens, the sound so terrifying it struck fear into the heart and shattered the gall. A creature resembling a *yaksha* leapt forth: its eyes blazed like lanterns, its mouth bristled with blades, its hair tangled like wild foliage, its body gnarled like twisted deadwood. Naked in form, unclothed in body, it brandished a wolf-toothed cudgel, leaping and bounding toward me, intent on devouring me. Overpowered, I cried out, *“Master! Master!”* I sat cross-legged, allowing it to flail its limbs, yet it dared not approach me. After concentrating my spirit for a moment, I exhaled a single breath, and it turned and bounded away.

I rose again and walked another *li* or so, only to find the path ahead blocked by a towering branch, as high as a hill, with not a single gap to pass through. Turning back, I saw the way behind choked with brambles, thorns, and trifoliate orange, trapping me in between. Unable to advance or retreat, my heart filled with dread. I cried out urgently, *“Yitong! Yitong! How have you lost your way to this? Have you so soon forgotten the bond between master and disciple? I came here for your sake, to save you from this harm—how could you now turn and harm me?”* As I finished speaking, with a sudden crack, a willow tree dropped from the sky, ensnaring me. Yet it dared not harm me outright, for a flicker of spiritual light still remained unextinguished within me. I called out again, *“Master! Master!”* With a wave of my hand, the tree dispersed.

After another *li*, I neared the place where he had hanged himself. The ancient trees stood desolate, no trace of human habitation, not even a bird in flight. The scene was far more desolate than when I had passed through before. In the distance, I saw a Daoist, his form ethereal as if beyond the material world, his bearing majestic with the aura of one who had attained the Dao. Clad in a green robe and blue sash, a yellow cap and jade-green shoes, he held a pure broom. Smiling, he greeted me: *“Fellow Daoist, where have you come from? Would you care to rest awhile in my humble abode?”* Knowing this was Yitong, I followed him to a thatched hut. Its courtyard, shaded by verdant trees, was serene and lovely.

I sat, and he took a seat beside me. Suddenly, he began discoursing on the art of the external elixir, speaking also of absorbing yin to supplement yang, of harming others to benefit oneself. I merely assented. After a short while, he rose and served tea and fruit.

I partook of the refreshments, showing no sign of surprise. Pleased, he smiled, believing he had won me over to his methods. Little did he know I had secretly gathered them into my gourd.

Then I enticed him, saying: *“Brother Daoist, dwelling here, your neighbors are trees and stones, your companions deer and swine. At dawn, the wind sighs through ten thousand hollows; at dusk, your solitary form lingers in stillness. With so little seen or heard, how can you unlock the mysterious gate? Without knowledge or perception, how can you achieve the nine-fold elixir? A secluded realm seals the dust from the sun’s gaze; a clouded mind obscures the path to heaven. Once ensnared in the web of desire, you will never escape the cage. If you plant the roots of sin, you must tend to them yourself; if you cultivate good deeds, you will never be at a loss. Heaven admits no wicked souls, while hell spares no virtuous ones. The nine-tailed fox devours men—how cruel!—yet cannot escape the bears of the Wei River; Yulei consumes ghosts—how mighty!—yet still falls to the scholar of Zhongnan Mountain. Since ancient times, those who accumulate goodness suffer no calamity—when have the violent ever avoided disaster? For your present course, it would be better to abandon this shady retreat and follow me along the lesser path to famed mountains and sacred realms. Seek out an enlightened master, pay homage to the true sovereign, and enjoy the boundless bliss of freedom, leaving behind the torments of the fiery pit. By shrinking the earth, you may ascend to heaven; through longevity, you may attain deathlessness. Weighing the two, which is the better choice?”*

He only laughed without answering, turning away to hem and haw for a long while. The moon shone white on the eastern ridge; in the dim window, he held a candle. His heart remained obstinate, showing not the slightest sign of repentance—instead, he mocked me with jesting words. Suddenly, he rose as if to relieve himself. I sat in silence, watching for any movement.

Then, all at once, a sharp *clang*—like a blade or axe hurled against bare stone—made me shudder and tremble, my heart pounding with dread. Before I could discern its cause, a piercing whistle cut the air. With a fierce bound, he leapt before me: his face livid, his eyes blood-red, fangs bared, a willow leaf sprouting from his skull like disheveled hair. His feet were gnarled as willow roots, his hands like withered branches, his body knotted and twisted. He needed not unleash his malice to strike terror—his very form and visage were enough to shatter a man’s courage. Even the hellish minions I had witnessed in the Yellow Millet Dream’s underworld—those grotesque, laughable, shocking, and fearsome specters—paled beside this apparition.

He wiped his hands and feet, bared his fangs, and glared, advancing and retreating with a menacing, hesitant air. I sat unmoving, eyes closed, preserving the primordial *qi*, imagining my master at my side. At the sound of a single cough, the demon vanished, leaving only the empty space beside me. The moon sank, stars faded, clouds dispersed, and the sun rose. Crows broke the dawn’s stillness; dogs barked in alarm. All around, the world was silent, devoid of any trace.

Brushing off my robes, I strode toward the shade of the green locust tree and wandered the mountain paths, lost in thought: *"If I depart in haste, the wayward youth will surely fall into wickedness, betraying my vow to deliver him. To break my oath to heaven would be a failing in my Daoist practice—how could I bear it? Yet if I linger here and the demon vanishes without a trace, where shall I seek him again?"* Caught between these two dilemmas, I hesitated as the sun dipped westward, shifting into the hour of *You*.

Suddenly, a fragrant breeze stirred, carrying an unusual scent. From the east appeared a young beauty, barely eighteen, her brows delicate as fresh willow shoots, her star-like eyes clear as still water. Her hair was coiled like the raven clouds of Wu Gorge, her cheeks rivaled the red apricots of Shanglin Park. No Chu maiden could match her radiance; no Wu beauty dare vie with her grace. Her jade hairpins were exquisitely small, her golden bracelets finely wrought. Her crow-black robe fluttered lightly, her moon-white skirt swayed gently. Her shoes outshone Pan Feiyan’s; her smile surpassed Bao Si’s—no need for the rending of silk to captivate. Truly, she stirred the heart without a hint of suspicion.

She carried a basket of bamboo shoots, passing by me before turning back, her gaze lingering. After half a *li*, she faced me again, set down her basket, and bowed deeply, saying: *"This humble woman is Yang of the Eastern Mountain. My husband passed away just a month after our wedding. With no parents-in-law above nor children below, and my own parents long gone, my brothers few, I vowed to remain chaste in his memory. For a full year, I have lived in solitude among the thatched huts. Today marks the anniversary of his death, and I gathered these shoots in the mountains to offer as a memorial. Yet, poor and alone, I lack the means to invite monks or Daoists to pray for his soul’s ascent to the celestial registers. My fidelity may endure, but how can his spirit find peace? Fortune has brought me this chance meeting with an immortal master. Though I dared not impose earlier, I feared losing this opportunity forever. Thus, I swallow my shame and beg your indulgence. If you possess even a shred of compassion, bestow your mercy upon my humble home and perform a simple rite for my late husband. Both the living and the dead would be forever grateful."*

I observed her composed demeanor and refined speech, her grasp of the Three Bonds and Five Constants, her adherence to the Three Obediences and Four Virtues. Convinced of her sincerity—though unversed in scripture—I initially refused. Yet her pleas grew so earnest that I reluctantly followed her.

We arrived at a modest but elegant dwelling, its walls adorned with ink-wash landscapes, a spirit altar set within. Entering the hall, she urged me to take the seat of honor, but I declined. *"I bow to my husband, not to you, immortal master—why refuse?"* After the bow, she took the bamboo shoots inside. The sun had set.

I thought of the adage: *"Tying one’s shoe in a melon field invites suspicion of theft; adjusting one’s hat beneath a plum tree risks false accusation."* Thus, I excused myself to leave. She replied: *"Immortal master, you are mistaken."*

Here stood no village ahead, no inn behind, nor any nunnery or temple—where could one find shelter? My dwelling is pure and clean, fit for your stay. Though storms may rage, they never cross my threshold, and my chaste resolve remains unstained. Would I rather couple wantonly with a stranger than unite through proper matchmakers with a worthy mate? Would I cast aside a thousand years of fragrant reputation in a single day—something even wood and earth would scorn, yet I would do?

Convinced by her earnest discourse, each word ringing true, I settled my heart and listened. Soon, she placed the bamboo shoots upon the table, and we sat facing each other. She made no further mention of the ritual for her husband, only urging me to eat, her eyes and brows beckoning. I sensed her ill intent, yet the night was still, and escape impossible—moreover, the gates were bolted fast. I steadfastly held to my resolve, unmoved.

She deployed a thousand wiles, a hundred charms, saying: *"Immortal master, this meeting today is heaven’s ordained union, not of mortal making. You are a husband long parted from his wife, and I, a woman dwelling in resentment. Dry wood meets raging fire, a parched fish finds living water—we must not let this moment slip."*

I remained silent, sitting still. She rose, lifting her chopsticks, and said: *"I have composed a new lyric; pray, lend your ears."*

The verse went:
Swift flies the time,
years hasten unseen—
years hasten unseen,
fair scenes and fine hours
must be enjoyed to the full.

Golden cups invite the host’s delight,
the bridal chamber loves the lotus candle’s light—
lotus candle’s light,
neck-entwined mandarin ducks,
all men envy such delight.

*"How do you find this?"*

I gave no answer.

She said: *"I have composed a new melody; pray, lend your ears once more."*

The song went:
Loose raven tresses half unbound,
a beauty’s grace—
jade bones, skin like ice.
Distant mountains, brows of sparse green,
autumn waves in limpid eyes, brimming with passion.
More lovely still, a single point of cherry lips,
peach cheeks half unfurled.
Fine silk veils tender bamboo,
light robes reveal soft flesh,
a waist so slender, so supple.

She continued:
A fair-faced beauty to share,
in the bloom of her nineteenth year, all the more enchanting.
Her bearing so winsome, so bewitching,
in plain adornment or rich, ever radiant.
Spring’s allure stirs the soul to melt;
silken curtains, brocade hangings,
phoenixes paired, lovebirds entwined.
The savor within—you must know it!

*"Immortal master, do not squander this hour. Join with me in the joy of marriage, tie this red thread of fate, bear sons and daughters, build a household, uphold your ancestors’ century-old line, and extend your descendants’ thousand generations of lineage. Is this not far better than a solitary form, a lone shadow, drifting east at dawn and west at dusk like a stray dog, a masterless spirit, a floating duckweed or drifting twig? In life, lacking sustenance; in death, no foundation for offerings—do you wish to be but chaff to fill the gullies?"*

Only then, hearing her wanton words, did I realize she was a wayward spirit in disguise.

I said, "Lady, do not let delusion plunge you into the Three Wretched Realms! Hear now the perils of love and desire between man and woman."

With the handle of my whisk, I struck the table to mark the rhythm, and sang:

The human body’s essence and qi flow like water,
all a hundred meridians rely on their fullness.
That single spark of true yang—cherish it well,
for lusting after flowers and willows brings only ruin.
Like withered wood or dried roots in the northern wind,
when moisture dries and waters run dry, years cannot last.
Fair maidens are axes that hew the body,
beauty is truly the worm that gnaws the tree.
Bewitching demons of passion toy with men—
though not sharp blades or gleaming swords,
they have slain every hero.
Let others adore the bloom of rosy cheeks,
I keep company with mist and clouds, rivers and peaks.
The resolve of Mount Tai cannot be shaken;
treasure essence, nurture qi to sustain the body.
Do not fall into the snare of fleeting pleasures,
for even joy is but a springtime dream.
The clear wind is my companion,
the bright moon my silken-canopied friend.
When husband and wife are content as mandarin ducks,
that is the true delight of heaven and earth—
what need for powdered faces and rouged lips?

"In our Daoist way, yin and yang are husband and wife,
wind and moon are friends,
flowers and birds bring joy,
mountains and waters stir the spirit.
Fruits and berries fill the belly,
spring streams quench thirst,
grass makes clothing, hemp makes sandals,
deer and cranes serve as attendants,
clouds and mist are our chariots,
heaven and earth our home,
the four seas our livelihood.
What greater bliss could there be?
What need to build estates or beget descendants?
We endure while heaven and earth endure,
remain ever-new through the ages—
what need for ancestral rites or grave offerings?"

At these words, the woman flushed with shame and dared not draw near.

Then I recalled, "My master once gave me a small gourd containing several pellets of elixir, saying they could be taken to perceive the mind’s true nature. This spirit has lost its original bearings and forgotten its roots—perhaps this elixir will help."

I reached into my sash, drew out the gourd, and poured the pills onto the table. Pointing at them, I said to her, "Eat these, and you will never hunger again. Their fragrance is sweet, their taste exquisite."

She smiled but paid no heed. I pressed her several times, yet she refused to look. As I returned the gourd to my sash, the woman transformed into a willow spirit—fangs bared, claws outstretched, ready to seize me.

I placed the gourd back on the table, leaned against the armrest, and feigned sleep, watching from the corner of my eye to see what she would do.

Seeing me lie down, the willow spirit crept near the table and snatched the gourd, playing with it. She poured the pills into her palm and swallowed them. No sooner had she done so than she stood frozen in place. After a moment, she leaned over the table and called out to wake me:

"Master, master! Long ago, beneath the locust tree, I served as your attendant. When all other plans failed, I hanged myself from a willow, becoming the tree’s spirit and turning demonic here. Little did I know my master would arrive—repeatedly, I have offended you. I beg your forgiveness and ask that you take me home."

The master’s virtue was vast indeed." With these words, she bowed deeply, weeping bitterly. Moved, I too felt a pang of sorrow, my heart heavy with grief. Yet I rejoiced that she had recognized her true nature and not remained forever on the demonic path, fulfilling my hopes. I recounted the full story to her, and through the night, we poured out our hearts to one another. By then, dawn had broken.

We stood beneath the weeping willow. The attendant said, "Since parting from you, master, I have relied on these demonic ways. Now, saved by your grace, I am a thousand times fortunate. This tree cannot remain—lest it bring harm again. Please step back, master, and I will be gone from here." With that, she grasped the tree and uprooted it with all her might, roots and all—truly a feat of divine strength. She then gathered the bones of all her past victims, buried them in a pit, and prayed to heaven in repentance. Afterward, she followed me on our journey.

As we neared the green locust tree, we saw Abbot Zhong seated beneath it. From afar, the attendant pointed and said, "That treacherous Daoist is the one who deceived you years ago, master, leading to my hanging and years of wandering. Now, by fortune, master and servant are reunited—like a withered tree blooming anew, a dried fish returned to water—yet here he comes again. Let me drag him down and cast him into a deep ravine, shattering his bones to dust. Only then will this day’s resentment be eased." She wiped her hands, gnashed her teeth, and glared, ready to charge. I shouted to stop her.

Approaching, I paid my respects to the abbot. The attendant’s anger still simmered. The abbot raised his left hand in the *mudra* of wish-fulfillment, and she immediately bowed. Turning to me, he said, "This attendant’s karmic debts are too deep, and her merits too few, to bring her back to the temple just yet. Your cultivation is nearly complete—what you lack is good affinity. I give you these elixir pills, several talismans, and a demon-slaying sword. Travel first to Handan, settle where you may, and wherever you find peril, aid those in need. Rescue the suffering, guide them toward goodness. When your merits are full, I will seek you out, and only then may you return with her."

He called the attendant and instructed, "You lost your root and fell into evil, causing much harm and accumulating deep karmic debt. Without your master’s salvation, you would have remained a monstrous thing, forever sunk in darkness. Now, your spirit is not yet dimmed, and your true nature awakened—this is your fortune. Since you took form from a willow, let ‘Willow’ be your surname. You shall be called Willow Attendant. Follow your master, bearing this sword. From now on, reject demons, take refuge in the true Dharma, cast aside the wolf’s cruelty, and nurture a heart of compassion. Turn the impulse to kill into the virtue of cherishing life, replace ruthlessness with mercy. Extend your love from the great to the small, from the desire to harm none to the resolve to harm nothing. When the human heart stirs, let the Dao-heart quietly endure. If wicked desires arise, suppress them at once. Thus may you atone for past wrongs, renew your karma, and truly become your master’s follower."

With that, he vanished in a gust of pure wind. Willow Attendant bowed again toward the sky. From then on, her former thoughts were gone, her mind utterly empty. She followed me toward Handan.

As we rested by the roadside, a scholar approached with a graceful air. He glanced at me and Willow Attendant with a faint smile and asked our purpose. I replied that I sold medicine. He inquired about the elixir of immortality, though in jest. I answered, "Is there no elixir of immortality? The ceaseless reverence of the august heavens, the unceasing purity of the sky—King Wen’s harmony with heaven, the sage’s unity with it. To be one with heaven is to be without end; without end is to be without beginning or end. Thus, is it not true that the elixir of immortality exists?" He then asked, "Are the teachings of heaven and hell real or not?"

I answered, "Heaven, earth, and humanity form the three powers of principle. The manifest and the hidden are the divisions of these three powers. The manifest has its overseers, while the hidden has its spirits and gods—this is an immutable principle. When one’s virtue is good, the mind’s essence is bright and clear, radiant and upright, aligning with yang in its power. When one’s nature is evil, it becomes dark and crooked, murky and obscured, aligning with yin in its power. Yang follows its kind to enter heaven, while yin follows its kind to enter earth. Things gather by kind, and beings separate by group—this is an immutable tendency. How could such distinctions exist only in the unfathomable and obscure?

For instance, when a person suffers illness in sleep, this is clear proof of experiencing hell. If the heart and intestines fester and rot, this is the hell of carving and flaying. If the throat and tongue ulcerate and decay, this is the hell of plowing and harrowing. If scorching flames and billowing smoke afflict, this is the hell of fiery pits. If boiling water and searing oil torment, this is the hell of cauldrons. The sores on the crown of the head are like the hidden placement of fire basins. The abscesses on the waist are like the dark suspension of rolling stones. When the whole body is wracked with pus and blood, the pain unbearable—what is this if not the hell of knife mountains? When the entire frame is seized by cramps, the agony unendurable—what is this if not the hell of hanging poles? When the body feels pressed by a thousand *jun* and cannot turn, this is the hell of grinding wheels. When every bone feels broken, the pain piercing flesh and sinew, this is the hell of pounding and beating. When sores and scabs cover the body, leaving no patch of unbroken skin, this is the hell of flaying. When stabbing pain racks the limbs as if they were being torn apart, this is the hell of sawing. When one smells fragrant food but cannot swallow it, is this not the hell of hungry ghosts? When one knows what one desires but cannot see it, is this not the hell of darkness? When blood is vomited by the basinful and discharged by the barrelful, is this not the hell of the blood pool? When pain strikes like snakebites in the east and thorn pricks in the west, is this not the hell of the village of evil dogs? When one shivers with alternating heat and cold, when thick furs bring no warmth and boiling water no relief, this is the suffering of the hell of ice mountains. When one cannot eat a full meal or wear proper clothes, lying ill for months without seeing the sun or sky, when fetters and shackles bind or cudgels and rods strike, this is entry into the Avīci hell. These are the manifest signs of the hidden in the world above and below—why doubt, sir?

As for those who ride in grand carriages with outriders shouting before and behind, who wear gold and purple and feast on rich delicacies, whose desires are fulfilled without seeking and whose wills are satisfied without striving, who roam in realms of carefree ease and delight in lands of joy—these dwell in heaven. Once, my master gave me a pillow, and by resting on it, one can awaken to the future and witness all things between heaven and earth. Would you like to try it?"

The scholar fell silent for a long while, then asked my surname. I replied with [redacted], and in turn, I asked his. He answered, "Lu." I gave him the pillow. He took it and lay down on my straw mat. Before the hour was out, he awoke from his dream and told me what he had seen, which matched exactly what I had said. Sighing deeply, he said, "Wealth and rank are but passing clouds before the eyes; fame and achievement are but inns on the road of life. Life is a sojourn, death a return—all is but a dream in a single sleep. May I now abandon my home and follow you as your disciple?"

I replied that though Lu had good intentions, his resolve was not yet firm. I did not accept him as a disciple but instead taught him the art of the Ninefold Returning Elixir, a method to prolong life and preserve destiny. We then parted ways, and this became the tale of *The Handan Dream*.

Leaving that place, I traveled to the cities of You, Yan, Liao, and Ji, reviving the weary and ailing from their sickbeds and relieving the distressed and destitute from their hardships. When I reached the Si River, I ascended the platform of Confucius, changed my attire to that of a village tutor, and sought lodging by carriage. There was a family of the Ji clan, a great household devoted to the study of life and destiny. All three of their sons studied the *Book of Changes*. Upon meeting me, I discussed with them the principles of the prior and posterior heavens. Ji Si was delighted and invited me to instruct his sons.

The eldest, Tong, the second, Da, and the youngest, Shu, were all earnest and sincere scholars. They treated me with the rites of disciples. At that time, those who followed me included Shen Yuan, Kong Da, Zhou Yijing, Bai Liang, Gongsun Yu, Chen Kun, Wang Zixian, Wang Zizong, Meng Ji, Kong Yinzhe, Kong Cheng, and Kong Ji—comrades of shared purpose and lofty aspiration, who stood out in their understanding of the Way, much like the disciples of the ancient Master Xuan Ni.

Only Lu Shaoji and Wang Zongsheng, though learned in letters, behaved crudely and at times showed disrespect. One day, I recited to the students the passage: *'Even if one possesses the talent and beauty of the Duke of Zhou, if he is arrogant and stingy, the rest is not worth observing.'* Then I expounded its meaning:

'The Duke of Zhou was endowed by heaven with extraordinary gifts, and through his diligence, he perfected the virtues of the Three Kings and embodied the four excellences. He governed the state and assisted in its administration, dispelling slander to restore the house of Ji, wielding the axe to suppress treacherous hearts. He was guided by the loftiest of virtues and expanded them with inexhaustible wisdom—his talent was truly beautiful. Yet he humbled himself before scholars, extended his concern to others, received the words of herdsmen with open mouth, and listened to the strategies of artisans with hair undone. Never complacent, he eagerly sought goodness, desiring to benefit all under heaven and bring them to the realm of brilliance and acuity. Only one with talent as beautiful as the Duke of Zhou would suffice. This is why the Duke of Zhou’s talent was beautiful, and why his beauty was worthy of praise.

If, however, he had flaunted his beauty, cherished his talent and feared others possessing it, prided himself on his excellence and feared others sharing it—then his talent would have been but a trivial matter, his beauty but an empty pursuit.'"

This is but a trifling matter, not worthy of esteem. How could one still cling to it, having nothing to observe? Even one as talented and virtuous as the Duke of Zhou must not be arrogant or stingy—how much less those beneath him, or those with but a single talent or skill? If the Duke himself, in his arrogance and stinginess, would render his talent unworthy of regard, how much more so those beneath him in arrogance and stinginess—what would there be to observe?

Extending this principle further: he who rules all under heaven, if arrogant and stingy, will lose his realm; he who governs a state, if arrogant and stingy, will lose his state; he who heads a household, if arrogant and stingy, will lose his household; he who possesses a self, if arrogant and stingy, will lose his self. How grave indeed is the harm of arrogance and stinginess!

You, my students, study to become sages and worthies, aspiring to assist the Son of Heaven above and the state below, and to establish yourselves and glorify your names to honor your parents. How could you tread this path of error? Where correction is due, correct; where effort is needed, strive. I share this with you all."

The two disciples, hearing this admonition, blushed with shame, sweat streaming down their backs. They bowed their heads and received the teaching. Before a season had passed, their reservations melted away like ice, and they embraced humility and modesty all the more.

On another evening, he expounded to them: *"When the crane calls in the shade, its young respond in harmony. If there were a fine office, I would share it with you."* All things between heaven and earth—those of the same sound resonate, those of the same qi seek one another, like kinds gather and unlike kinds separate, not even a hair’s breadth apart. Thus, feet tread the same path, mouths share the same tastes, ears delight in the same sounds, eyes behold the same sights. All of like kind are alike—why should the heart alone be doubted?

What hearts share in common is virtue. Virtue is heaven’s true nobility, the heart’s fine office. When hearts and virtue align in this, heavenly office is complete, and human desires and aspirations converge. All who possess the innate goodness of constant norms will arise with the resolve to respond and follow, unbound by borders or boundaries, unrestricted by youth or age, lowliness or eminence. Those who delight in it share the same response; those who admire it harbor no divergent thoughts.

Without this, heaven and earth’s processes of generation, growth, harvest, and storage would be nothing but virtue; our own lives and destinies are likewise rooted in this virtue. Preserve this virtue wholly, unstained by even a speck of dust, all thoughts clarified. Unmuddied by the tumult of distracting desires, immersed in the profound tranquility of heaven’s depths—then what heaven and earth possess, you possess; what heaven and earth govern, you govern. Thus, you penetrate the heavenly mechanism, pierce the earth’s axis, and this resonance elicits that response: the crane calls, and its young answer in harmony.

You may thus take your place between heaven and earth, preceding heaven while the world follows, following heaven while adhering to its timing—yet all the while, you know not that heaven and earth are for me, but that I am for heaven and earth.

After residing there for a year, whenever I expounded the teachings, I illuminated profound principles with clear analogies, guiding the disciples step by step into the mysteries. Zhou was the first to awaken. Fearing my traces might be exposed, on the first day of the month, at dawn, I departed without a word.

Arriving at Huai, I encountered a great outbreak of pestilence. I halted at a thatched hermitage, distributing talismanic water; all who drank were completely cured. For those of ample means, I offered a talisman for a single coin; from the poor, I accepted nothing. Thus, I preserved the lives of nearly ten thousand in the prefecture, and amassed over ten million coins, which I stored in a treasury. After the epidemic, when famine struck and corpses lined the roads, I distributed the coins in relief, saving hundreds more. For I had foreseen this and accepted payment for the talismans in advance. Once the funds were exhausted, I departed.

Proceeding to the Three Wu regions of Yangzhou, I visited the Terrace of Xishi and the Stone Chamber. The land of Wu revered spirits, trusted talismans, and favored shamanic practices, yet its customs were frivolous and decadent, its mores profoundly shallow. There, I transformed into the Mad Daoist, while Willow Wanderer became my young attendant. We sang as we walked along the roads:

*I recall descending the mountain, riding the pure wind,
Head crowned with white clouds, feet treading dragons.
Drinking from stone springs, feasting on pine—
Singing a hymn of the Dao, chanting a ha-ha-li-yao-hong, ha-ha-li-yao-hong.*

Willow Wanderer harmonized with his own song:

*Following my master, transformed into a gust of wind,
Clad in straw, staffed by a dragon.
My companion is the bright moon, my friend the Red Pine—
Singing a hymn of the Dao, chanting a ha-ha-li-yao-hong, ha-ha-li-yao-hong.*

We sang wildly along the way, stirring the entire town. Young and old, men and women, thronged the streets to watch. Seeing the crowd, I composed myself with solemn dignity and called out, *"This poor Daoist seeks a most generous benefactor, a venerable elder of karmic affinity!"* After each proclamation, I would burst into mad song, yet by day’s end, none appeared. The next day, the same. On the third day, an elder of sixty, his hair half-black, half-white, bearing a robust and imposing presence, stood firm, fixed his gaze, watched for a while, then slowly inquired, *"What does this Daoist seek from such a benefactor?"* Feigning ignorance, I continued my cries. The elder seized my arm.

With a swift hook of his foot, Liu Xing sent the elder tumbling head over heels, rolling twice before he sprawled on the ground. The crowd erupted in laughter. The elder scrambled up at once, turned, and hurried home, barking orders to four or five sturdy servants to seize us both and haul us away. The onlookers gasped, certain we were doomed. This elder was none other than the local despot of Gusu—Yuan Bojī, the Winged Tiger—his wealth beyond measure, his retinue of servants and attendants numbering in the hundreds, his concubines and maids uncounted. Those who crossed him were beaten to death with his staff, and none in the prefecture dared challenge his arrogance.

Dragged into the central hall, Bojī gnashed his teeth in fury. *"You wild Daoists—how dare you be so insolent! I am the foremost magnate of this prefecture; who does not defer to me? I inquired after your purpose in good faith—why then did you, like thieves and rogues, mock me before the crowd, making a spectacle of my headwrap and inviting public ridicule?"* He roared at his servants, *"First, give them thirty strokes of the great cudgel! Then send them to the authorities to have their crimes properly punished!"*

The servants moved to strike Liu Xing first. Before the rod could touch him, Liu transformed, revealing his true form. The servants shrieked, their souls scattering in terror, and fled in panic, clutching their heads. Bojī collapsed to the ground in shock, lying motionless for some time before he revived. When he rose and saw only our familiar faces, he asked in bewilderment, *"You Daoists are most strange. Where did that monstrous apparition come from just now?"*

I smiled and replied, *"Elder, your eyes fail to discern good from ill, to distinguish virtue from malice. Here stand only my master and disciple—where do you see any monster? Have you not heard the *Scripture of the Supreme*? ‘When a man harbors good intentions, though he has not yet acted, auspicious spirits already attend him. When a man harbors evil intentions, though he has not yet acted, malevolent spirits already follow him.’ My disciple and I are but humble men of the Dao, begging alms in the streets, never having trespassed against you. Yet you, elder, brought this humiliation upon yourself—your stumble on the road was but an accident, yet you sought to harm my master and me. Such was your evil intent, and so the evil spirits took shape, visible to you though unseen by us. How many years remain to you in this life? Does time linger for any man?"*

Is spirit like flowing water? Is power like the Eastern Ocean? There is trust and betrayal, success and failure. Take, for example, a vessel—those sturdy endure longer, while the frail break early. Elder, your wealth and status, your arrogance toward the world and disdain for others, all stem from roots planted in past lives. If in this life you cultivate good deeds, preserving the integrity of your soul, you may be reborn in another fine place, much like this one. But if you lose your way, acting recklessly by your own nature, your spirit-light will scatter and flee—how then could you retain such power? To know the causes of past lives, observe the blessings of this one; to foresee the fate of lives to come, examine your actions now.

While this breath remains, you have gold and silver, fine food and clothing, wife and children, and mighty influence. But when this three-part breath is gone, gold and silver are emptiness, food and clothing are emptiness, wife and children are emptiness, and power is emptiness. Reflect, ponder—it is not too late to turn back. Strike a blow, kick away desire, and only then will you awaken. Recall how, moments ago, you saw a phantom and collapsed in terror—had you not revived, who knows what would have become of you? How then could you have spoken with this poor Daoist?

Your servants and retainers, long nourished by your generosity, your maids and concubines, your wife and children, all cherished by your care—when this crisis struck, each fled for their own lives, hiding or running away. Not one remained at your side. Yet I, this poor Daoist, though we have just met and you never granted me the slightest kindness—instead seeking to take my master’s and my life—chose to stay and tend to you rather than flee. Elder, let this moment give you pause for deep reflection.

In my hermitage, I composed a song to pass the time, and now I bid this boy sing it for you to hear.

The boy, obeying his master’s command, sang:

*(Song lyrics to follow)*

Life drifts like duckweed or willow floss—rootless, unmoored.
Why cling so desperately, refusing to turn back?
Gold and silver piled higher than mountains,
Crimson cheeks and painted brows in endless revelry.
Spirit drained, body spent in ceaseless passion,
Dawn’s joy, dusk’s delight—never a moment’s rest.
A thousand delicacies fill your mouth,
Silken robes and embroidered gowns adorn your frame.
In and out, you ride fine carriages and four-horse teams,
Ever drawn to the pleasures of flowers and willows.

Then consider:
All you possessed in this world—how swiftly it all came to nothing.
Wealth like hills could not be guarded,
Fair faces and tender beauty were cast aside.
Feast and finery turned to emptiness,
Jade bridles and golden saddles could not be mounted again.
Now you lie beneath a mound of green grass,
Foxes and pines your only companions.
Even if you had worthy sons and filial grandsons,
Could they bear your sorrows in your stead?

The boy finished singing and burst into laughter: *"Foolish man! Seeing only what lies ahead, never what comes after. Who lies beneath the northern ridge? Who rests in the eastern fields? That grassy mound once held a hero; that lofty knoll once cradled a man of wealth. The white-haired elder on the high mountain? A man who spurned fame and fortune. The rosy-cheeked scholar in Penglai? One who never chased flowers or willows. Foolish man! Foolish man! You sought to harm us—why then did you see spirits and ghosts?"*

He spoke on, laughing again. The elder sat motionless as a clay statue, struck dumb by the words. After a long silence, he bowed deeply before me and sighed: *"Alas, this old body never recognized true worth. Master, every word you speak is truth, every line rings with reason. But I am old, my days waning like the setting sun, my essence depleted by the past—how can I cultivate now to complete what I once began? I beg you, take the high seat. I wish to become your disciple and receive your teachings."*

I did not refuse his bow and immediately imparted to him the secret of *"turning the light inward to return to the root."* After ten days, he had already entered the first stage of the Way. I entrusted him with the task of seeking herbs and departed. Not only had I transformed his stubborn nature, but I had guided him into the mysteries of the profound. This was the first great achievement of the boy, Liu Xing.

Along the way, I dispensed medicine: in a single day, I cured ten cases of carbuncles, five of parasitic afflictions, and eighteen of consumptive wasting. I initiated one monk and three Daoists. Then, taking Liu Xing with me, I traveled to Jiangyou, entering Yushan, where no human traces remained. We sat beneath a poplar tree, and Liu Xing said: *"Master, this is my tree. I detest it—we cannot stay here."* So we moved to a catalpa tree.

After a moment, the poplar tree rumbled like thunder, then creaked like a turning cartwheel, then crowed like a rooster. Liu Xing exclaimed: *"Strange! Strange indeed!"* In an instant, he drew his sword, intent on hunting the strange presence, following the sound as it wound through the mountains. I rose to follow, but before I had taken a hundred steps, another Liu Xing appeared, saying: *"Master, where are you going? The boy who follows you is your disciple—what is this thing?"* I was startled, unable to tell them apart.

The first Liu Xing, who had urged me to leave, glared and said: *"This is my master, Master Lü. What kind of spirit are you?"* Liu Xing replied: *"This is my master. I am Liu Xing, named by Ancestor Zhong."* The spirit said: *"I am a willow spirit. Years ago, I followed my master, Lü Yan, to the capital. I died as a willow tree and became a willow spirit. Where did this Liu Xing come from?"*

Liu Xing turned to me: *"Master, please sit again. Let me slay this spirit before we go."* Then he said to the spirit: *"If you are real, let us test our skills—what say you?"* The spirit agreed.

Both displayed their powers. Liu Xing let out a great shout—wild winds uprooted trees, sand and stones flew in chaos, battering the spirit. The spirit responded with a roar, summoning a black mist and countless jagged staves raining down from the sky. Liu Xing blocked and parried, sending the staves scattering to the ground. With a fierce cry—*"Begone!"*—beasts roared, and packs of jackals emerged. The spirit remained unruffled, countering with a shout that summoned lions and elephants, dragons thrashing in the waves.

They clashed, one wielding the might to topple mountains and shatter cliffs, the other unleashing the force to overturn seas and upend rivers. A thousand paths diverged, a thousand transformations unfolded. I watched for a long time and saw that the spirit’s power was no less than Liu Xing’s. With a flick of my whisk and a point of my sword, the spirit vanished without a trace. The poplar tree trembled, its roar like fury—only then did I realize it was the spirit of the poplar.

I handed my sword to Liu Xing and ordered him to fell the tree. With one mighty swing, he split it in two. Blood flowed into the mountain stream, and the spirit was vanquished.

We passed through Rao, circled Jiujian and Hongdu, and visited the mountains of Dragon and Tiger, seeking the company of the profound and true. Disguised as a Perfect Realized One, I expounded the mysteries of the One Aperture, but none understood. So I journeyed to Min. The customs of the southern barbarians were even more resistant to awakening. Thus, I sang in the marketplace, weaving profound principles into common speech, concealing true subtleties within vulgar words—hoping the world might find it easier to follow and perhaps be transformed.

*(Song to follow)*

Upon the lofty terrace, a mirror—pure and bright,
Discerning beauty from ugliness, dividing fair from foul.
In its wholeness and truth, it receives the empty and numinous,
Embracing all principles, responding to the spirits’ call.

Yet suddenly defiled by grime and dust,
Its reflection sullied, its truth obscured.
The clear turns turbid, the bright grows dim,
Heaven retreats, and man encroaches in.
The moon veiled by clouds, the water drowning duckweed,
Its nature ravaged, its order undone.

I urge you: scrape away the filth, scour clean the dust,
Restore this emptiness and numinosity, reclaim your original truth.
The One Aperture embraces all, never sinking into the depths—
Thus may you endure, no need for recasting.
Let your heart be like water, ever clear,
Like the moon, ever bright.
Through heaven and earth, across all time,
From bustling thoroughfares to winding alleys,
From crowded markets to desolate paths,
I passed through them all.

Listeners pressed shoulder to shoulder, garment to garment,
Old and young, men and women, all strained to hear,
Yet not one stirred in heart to inquire.
Thus I sang for ten days, but my art found no purchase.

Then at the crossroads, I set up an incense table,
Wrote talismans and practiced healing arts to cure the sick.
Those who sought the talismans found divine response,
And so some came to my door.
They arrived in succession, numbering over fifteen hundred.
Gradually awakening, their numbers swelled day by day.

Harassed by the authorities as a follower of Zhang Jiao’s ilk, the two of us were seized and imprisoned for a full hundred days—such was fate, so I did not flee. When the term expired, both Liu Xing and I emerged from prison and fled to the eastern and western Guang provinces, traversing even the most barren lands. Through wind and rain, enduring the ravages of cold and scorching heat, we tasted every hardship to its dregs, suffering toils and exhaustion beyond what others could bear.

By my reckoning, those who entered the Mystic Gate numbered in the millions, and those I saved and aided totaled fifteen million seven hundred thousand and more.

At that time, I passed through Huoshui Village once again. Within, I had already attained true enlightenment, and the hermitage remained as before. I dwelled beside my ancestral graves, awaiting communion with the divine. After more than ten days, I beheld my parents both residing in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, dwelling in the Pure Land as lords of that radiant realm.

Yet perils were beyond counting. As I prepared to return to the hermitage, my master arrived and declared: “Your merit and virtue are now complete, vast and boundless—heavenly records have been made of them. Yet the vital essences of mountains and rivers must not go ungathered. You must wander further, surveying the finest landscapes, seeking the Dao and the Mystic, to refine the essence and strengthen your foundation. I shall come to guide you at Zhongnan; there is no need to return to the old hermitage.” Turning to Liu Xing, he added, “You must follow with utmost care, for your merit is no small matter.” We both received his decree. Then, in an instant, my master ascended upon the clouds and departed.

Liu Xing and I first journeyed to the Iron Gate Pass, then sailed a boat upon Dongting Lake. We paid homage at the Shrine of the Xiang Consorts and left a poem in mourning:

Nine banners and imperial regalia rest upon Jun Mountain,
The Emperor’s daughters, full of feeling, linger here.
Who knows how much blood and tears have flowed?
Ten thousand pearls of jade are all stained with their grief.

We turned toward the Mute Spring to pay respects at the Temple of Ma Yuan, where I inscribed another poem:

A blazing heroic spirit, a minister unmatched in his age,
He seized the first victory over the southern tribes.
A loyal soul, through a thousand ages, retains its vital qi,
Even in death, his martial might aided Kongming.

Next, we came to Mount Wudang, where I sought the secrets of the Tortoise and Snake, Water and Fire. That very night, I faced the North Star and discoursed on the principles of the Great Monad, obtaining the sublime and wondrous teachings of the highest order. Then I composed a regulated verse:

Within the cavity, a perfect pearl nestles close to the jade hairpin,
Jade nectar soaks the golden robe upon the crown.
The spring breeze stirs not the bamboo before the window,
Yet night rain nourishes the peaches beyond the sea.

Tigers roar and dragons chant as lead and mercury unite,
Snakes coil and tortoises breathe where Kan and Li intersect.
The vow fulfilled, the Three Lights shine undimmed,
Illuminating the spirit’s rhinoceros horn to towering heights.

Again it is said:
Before the cliff, an iron pestle was ground,
Success fears not the labor’s weight.
Through three thousand six hundred kalpas, the practice complete,
Forged is the demon-subduing Tai’e sword.

Turning toward Plum Mountain, I composed a verse on Hanging Arrow Peak:
Deceiving Mei, the jade sap first flowed,
Startled by barbarian riders in the thinning mist.
Had not the peak still borne its arrow,
Who would recall the general’s might of years gone by?

Gazing toward Wuling Stream, I reached the summit of Mount Wuyi.
For ten days, I surveyed the scenery,
Awaiting the arrival of Daoist friends,
Hoping to engage them in discourse.

I composed an ancient-style poem:
South of the Jian River, the land teems with spirit,
Lush and verdant with pine and bamboo.
Ages pass, unknowing of Yao’s reign,
Yet in the still night, the flute of Prince Wang is heard.

Peach blossoms drift upon the winding waters,
Waves surge through stone ravines, casting cold jade.
Does the azure phoenix cry as a common bird?
What wild beast pursues the dark deer?

I watch the lads plucking magic mushrooms,
Clad in lotus and water-chestnut robes, swaying in the breeze.
From what era hails the crimson-cheeked elder?
He speaks of life since Pangu’s time.

The mountain gate knows neither cold nor attachment,
Peaches red, roses purple.
I would take white stones and green essence,
Casually kindling dragon bamboo to boil them.

Mount Wuyi, fair and lofty,
Where one may grasp the profound and escape life and death.
Here, the days and months remain ever thus,
A game of chess consumes the bright daylight.

Ascending Sleeping Dragon Ridge, I surveyed its summit’s sights,
Beholding relics that stirred deep feeling—truly a hero’s mark.

I composed a poem:
Often did Liangfu chant, embracing his knees,
The hidden dragon stirs, leaping to meet the dragon.
His strategies surpassed the scholars of his age,
Even now, the Eight Gates of Dunjia evoke admiration.

Again at Dragon Tiger Mountain, I sought the remnants of the Daoist legacy,
Staying ten days, I left a poem:
Dragon Tiger Mountain divides in dragon and tiger form,
The nine provinces’ map finds truth here.
You, sir, are no mere mortal—meeting a hero,
Revealing heaven and earth nurturing the land’s spirit.

Red talismans guard the thousand-year records of the forbidden court,
A white crane rests amid the pines like a wisp of cloud.
I ask: where has the master gone?
In the azure mist’s embrace, seeking ginseng and poria.

From Tiantai, I stepped across the Stone Beam,
Seeking the abode of arhats,
Tracing the old veins of Peach Blossom Spring,
Straight to the summit, deep into perilous passes,
I sat cross-legged at the root of an ancient cypress.

The night was still, the moon bright,
All sounds hushed.
Then, faintly, the murmur of flutes and pipes arose,
Music blending in harmonious chorus.

From a crevice in the ridge emerged dozens of youths,
Clad in lotus robes, barefoot and tousled,
Marching in ranks, vanishing southward.

Again, clear tones of sheng and se lingered,
A group of white-haired and rosy-cheeked elders passed before me.
I bowed, but they vanished like a dream.

Then, joyous voices and laughter resounded,
Dozens of celestial maidens faded into the eastern mist.

In a single night, a thousand visions unfolded.
I composed a five-character ancient-style poem:
Tiantai’s peaks are most wondrous,
Steep cliffs, sheer as carved jade.
A thousand summits cluster like feathers of green,
A single stream encircles jade’s luster.

The Stone Beam Bridge arches across,
Like a dragon spanning the nine heavens.
Waves still as a dragon’s sword scales,
Pines steadfast as cranes returning to their nests.

I hear the women who fled Qin
Do not become the rain of King Xiang.
Moonlight graces their cloud-like skin,
Rosy pendants rise with the wind.

Old monks gather ferns for sustenance,
Entering samadhi upon the celestial altar.
Peaches follow warm ravine streams,
A hundred locks chill the ancient crags.

Stone gates close from time to time,
Years and months unrecorded.
I would knock upon the mystery within mystery,
Yet refine the qi within qi.

Suddenly, from the empty valley,
Music resounds like the wind of heaven.
Ten thousand ravines devoid of human trace,
Flowers bloom red through all four seasons.

I boarded a boat for the Southern Sea to pay homage to the Great Being.
Ascending Mount Luojia, gazing upon the tides,
I awakened to the wondrous, perfect, and luminous Dao,
Delved into the Mahayana’s great Dharma,
Stood firm to behold the Tathagata,
My wisdom eye meeting the secret of Dharma.

I composed a gatha:
Bright and clear, the moon at the sea’s heart,
Perfect and harmonious, lacking nothing.
One day, lifted to the center of the sky,
Its pure radiance illumines the darkest night.

Hark!
Shattering the relic within,
Why rest when one may wander freely?

I composed another poem:
The mountain floats like a wave-crested eggplant,
My southern journey to India halts here, mooring my raft.
At dawn, I dine on jade dew, dragons offering the alms bowl,
By night, golden lotuses boil, deer adding blossoms.

The meditation cell, pure and seething, seals the clouded cliffs,
Pearl and angelica gleam, vying with the moon’s splendor.
Behold the eastern lands beyond the seas,
Where sky and ocean blur, free of perching crows.

I traveled to the Southern Seas, reaching Feilai Peak in Lin’an,
Meditating in the Call-to-Apes Cave, unseen by any.
I said to Liu Xing: “Marvelous is this peak!
Peaks pierce the heavens, sheer cliffs hang inverted,
The cave wrought by heaven and earth—
Such is the land’s beauty!”

I composed a poem:
A wing of the sacred vulture unfurls,
Exquisite as if self-soaring.
Within the cave, a monk enters samadhi,
The mountain still, a crane comes to roost.

When the meal is ready, apes are called to eat,
As scriptures are chanted, birds awaken to understanding.
I urge you to stay long,
Never again to take flight.

There was a monk named Huiyi, who knew of my arrival,
Most kind, he exchanged secrets with me.
Thus, he abandoned Chan to return,
From stillness perceiving nature,
From emptiness recognizing being.

He led me to observe Dongxiao.
Together, we composed and responded in verse.

I composed a poem:
Step by step I enter the sacred peaks,
With each stride ascending higher.
Nine summits encircle emerald cliffs,
A single path winds through azure skies.
Flying squirrels like gray cranes,
Mountain sweetleaf blooms like peach blossoms.
The cave’s gate stands ever open,
Inviting one to follow the path of Youchao.

The monk responded in verse:
Nine emerald screens rise in layered arches,
Green peaks tower in myriad folds.
The lofty summit brushes the sun,
Two caves stretch dimly into the heavens.
A lone village’s fire flickers in the distance,
Ancient trees bear springtime peaches.
The Chan mechanism rests in solitude,
No need to learn the ways of climbing nests.

From Dongxiao to Tianmu, we linked verses.
I said:
Heavenly pillars stand east and west,
Divine eyes hang left and right.

(The monk:)
Mists and clouds fly beneath our feet,
(I:)
Stars and constellations array before my chest.

(The monk:)
All the young return to stillness,
Every emptiness enters Chan.
(I:)
Above, golden bells resound,
(The monk:)
In the monastery, jeweled lamps burn bright.

Strange rocks crouch like tigers,
Creeping fig carpets the earth like coins.
(I:)
Waterfalls pierce the peaks like needles,
Rainbow-hued cliffs join like woven silk.
(The monk:)
When the ephemeral flower blooms, pluck it,
Snail-script characters form a bound volume.
(I:)
Moths return, orioles remain undisturbed,
Spring dew adorns the lush grass.
(The monk:)
Sheer cliffs soar into the azure,
(I:)
Jagged peaks meet the blue heavens.
Our laughter and discourse startle the unenlightened,
(The monk:)
Yet this world’s fate remains boundless.

We completed ten linked couplets; the rest of the poems are not recorded, for they cannot all be recounted.

After lingering for over a month, one evening the monk said to me: “Gathering is easy, parting is hard. I am fortunate to have encountered a crane-like companion—how could I bear to separate? Yet Nirvana calls me first; I must depart to prepare for our next meeting. Tomorrow at noon, I ask that you point the way for my return.”

Thus passed over a month of friendship. At noon the next day, the monk bathed, sat upright, and passed away. I prepared a coffin and placed it on the mountain, gathering the assembly below. As the flames rose, I held the torch and recited a gatha:

Do not wander in straw sandals,
Cherish your cloud-woven robe for self-cultivation.
On Mount Sumeru, the scenery is fine—
Look back, and the ephemeral flower silently unfurls its fragrance.

Cease your restless wandering, abandon haste,
From this day shed your foul skin-bag.
Leave true traces across the great thousand worlds,
In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, sun and moon endure long.

Ah!
Leap from the river of desire—spring days are fair,
On the Anavatapta Lake, drink the purest ghee.

In that moment, amid the flames, his true form appeared, laughing as it ascended straight westward. The monks gathered the remaining ashes, and I then took my leave.

I sailed to Jinshan, gazing across the vast ocean, and stayed at the mountain temple for over ten days. I composed a poem:

Boundless are the azure waves, vast and deep,
The mountain within seems a green conch shell.
Monks return, washing their bowls as dragons devour rice,
Guests sit watching the tide, dining on alligator soup.
A perilous peak looms beneath the moonlit tower,
Scriptures recited from the Dharma seat drown in surging waves.
I rinse my dust-laden sleeves in the clear current,
Delighting in the celestial wind’s harmonious dance.

Following the current, I pursued my journey, savoring the scenery along the way. I inquired after the wonders of Jiuhua and traced the relics of the Six Dynasties, then lingered at Jiuhua. The weather was clear and mild, the mountain’s beauty radiant. I composed a quatrain:

The sky clears, revealing Jiuhua’s splendor,
Mountains like layered screens draped in green gauze.
Once the path to bodhi was pointed out,
The way to Pāramitā lies not far ahead.

At the mountain’s foot lived a Daoist named Jin Shouyi, who had built a hut for alchemy. Upon meeting me, he inquired about the arts of transmutation. I replied: “The pursuit of elixirs is but a delusion for the greedy. Have you not observed the fox? It deludes itself with sunlight and moonlight, stealing human souls and spirits, then transforming—now a man, now a woman—to bewitch others, none the wiser. Yet when it encounters a master of the Dao, its true form is revealed, and the fox cannot hide. Thus, one knows that one’s original nature cannot be feigned. If human effort could alter it, heaven would not produce treasures, nor earth nurture rare jewels.

An ancient saying goes:
‘Truth and falsehood are hard to confuse,
In the end, one must return to one’s original form.
The greedy may scheme with all their cunning,
Only to trap themselves in cold poverty.’
Now heed my words!”

“He chanted:
‘I urge you, cease your firing of lead and mercury,
For time and years are but a vain burden.
The yellow sprout may never take root,
And what use is the white snow?
Companion to paper ash—
As if you’ve dreamed the butterfly’s dream.
Companion to paper ash—
As if you’ve dreamed the butterfly’s dream!’

He continued:
‘Three-sided crucibles and tripods, fires fed in vain,
Foolishly clinging to civil and martial arts.
Seeking rebirth to nurture the sands,
Drawing qi yet never leaving the mother.
All day long refining celestial sulfur—
Have you not borne enough toil?
All day long refining celestial sulfur—
Have you not borne enough toil?’

He added:
‘Seeking the elixir through dead arsenic, lead, and mercury,
Boasting of a method to reach the heavens.
The five metals yield no favor,
The eight minerals never truly unite.
Entering the bright furnace,
Passing through the lead pool—
All is but riding the raft upon the waves.
Entering the bright furnace,
Passing through the lead pool—
All is but riding the raft upon the waves.’

He declared further:
‘People of the world speak of firing the elixir,
Claiming one must first perfect the inner.
Yet who knows the inner, once achieved, bears no burden?
The myriad mirrors need not trouble the heart,
Nor the wooden raft be prized.
Even if you turn stone to gold,
In the end, it crumbles to brick.
Even if you turn stone to gold,
In the end, it crumbles to brick.’

Jin Shouyi, upon hearing my words, immediately smashed his elixir furnace and alchemical vessels to pieces. He sought the secret of a single aperture, tireless in his pursuit. I, too, revealed the full truth without reservation, holding nothing back. Having guided him onto the path, I brushed my sleeves and departed like a swallow in flight.”

Perched atop the peaks of Five Clouds, I gazed toward the desert wastes. Long I stood in melancholy contemplation, and so composed the *"Rhapsody on Yearning for the March."*

The rhapsody reads:
Misty, misty—Yan Clouds stretch north to the Wolf’s Watch,
Where frontier geese cry and frontier steeds race.
Ascending the heights, my thoughts surge unbounded—
Ten thousand li of mist and glow veil distant sight.
Fine sands drift, swirling and rising,
Blanketing the earth in golden reed-grass.
Where, oh where, lie the passes and mountains?
Even without sorrow, my heart would break.

In the still night, beneath the bright moon, a Qiang flute plays,
Startling me from a soldier’s dream upon my frontier cot.
Just now, in a perfumed chamber, we spoke of parting—
Who could know I would not share my days with wife and child?

I recall leaving home in the bloom of youth;
Now frost has settled upon my temples.
At the gate, my kind mother strains her eyes in vain,
While my wife’s heart must be heavy with longing.
In her boudoir, silk sleeves grow damp, layer upon layer,
Stained by the blood-tears of one gone to war.
Look—upon the sands, bones pile mountain-high,
All the longing of those left behind.

At my waist, the bronze seal of command has yet to turn to gold,
Yet beneath the starry skies of the frontier, my soul is already spent.
Though my noble name may be inscribed on bamboo annals,
How can filial piety and virtue hallow a barren grave?
My gaze strains until my nose stings with sorrow—
For the bitter toil of those conscripted to the march.

Life and death have ever been inescapable;
Why do later generations weep in vain for those gone before?

Another poem on Mount Wutai:
Step upon step, tier upon tier,
Its towering form pierces the azure sky.
A cough or sigh would not reach the realm of Zhuanxu—
Might this be the dragon that brings the sweet rain?

Descending Mount Wutai, I set my raft adrift among the stars.
Tracing the Yellow River to its source, I met my teacher upon a boat.
He said, “Why not return?”
Taking my hand, he led me to wander the Three Bees, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou,
And sat with me atop Dongying Mountain.
Turning to me, he said, “In seeking you, I grew parched upon the road.
East of the Eastern Sea grows a peach—fetch it, that I may eat.”
Then, to the willows, he said, “Stay here.”
I accepted his command and went.

The eastern mountain rose ten thousand *ren* high, with no peach tree in sight.
Walking ever eastward, I came upon a tree a *li* in girth,
Its branches thick, a hundred spans around—yet no peaches.
Only on the easternmost bough, slender as a finger, hung a peach the size of a melon,
Dangling above the roiling torrents and towering waves.
Heedless of my life, I strained upward with all my strength,
Broke the branch, plucked the peach, and offered it to my teacher.
Delighted, he said, “How fine this peach! How could I bear to eat it alone?”
He divided it into three, and we shared it.

When we had finished, my teacher asked,
“When you broke the peach, did you see anything?”
I replied, “No.”
“Come.”

We then went together to see it.” Arriving at the peach tree, we looked into the current and saw a corpse afloat in the heart of the waves. Upon close examination, it was none other than my own form. My teacher pointed and said, “Is this not your flesh-and-blood body? Now that it has departed, you may face the Celestial Emperor.” That very day, we stood together before the Jade Emperor, who issued a decree naming me the Perfected One of Pure Yang. The date was recorded as the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the *gengshen* year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang.

By imperial edict, Willow was made an immortal; Willow received the decree. After paying respects and taking leave of the Emperor, my teacher and I returned to our original abode in the Paradise of Lang. There, Masters Li and Zhang met with great joy. After some time, the Queen Mother of the West arrived, and later still, the Star of Jade Balance, Ma Gu, the Supreme Perfected of the Celestial Pole, Cloud Maiden, Moon Slave, and the immortals of Mount Shang, Yixian, and other realms gathered like clouds, all coming to offer their congratulations. When the celebrations concluded, they departed.

I dwelt in the Paradise of Lang, wishing to universally deliver all beings. My teacher assented. I took leave of my teacher and, accompanied by Willow, set forth on our travels. I was born as a scholar in Changli to propagate the Daoist arts and deliver Master Han; I became a Daoist in Wuyuan to manifest divine powers and deliver the Lady He. I assisted Master Zhong by concealing my traces and aided Master Zhang by transforming my body, thereby delivering the Imperial Uncle and the Divine Elder. As for the Three Drunken Revels of Yueyang, where I painted a yellow crane to repay the host—such illusions began in my youth. In Luoyang, I wandered often, tossing gold to tease the Bodhisattva, for in my youth I was not swayed by wayward intentions. I dispensed medicine in Lu, revealed my form in Han, ever practicing benevolence and spreading kindness. I traversed rivers, lakes, and seas without exception; I journeyed through the capital’s outskirts and distant frontiers without fail.

Then came the affairs following my transcendental molting. Once the Eight Perfected had assembled, my virtue and conduct surpassed all bounds, and the Emperor elevated my rank, bestowing the title *Hongren Puji Fuyou Dijun*, enthroning me in the Eastern Palace as Chief Minister of the Highest Order.

From that time onward, Heaven and Earth remained unshattered, and my divine transformations knew no end—how could mere brush and paper ever capture them in full? I do not delight in flattering the world to gratify the hearts of men, nor do I relish the tedium of verbose discourse. Yet the disciples pressed earnestly, and I reluctantly complied, gathering these rough outlines to recount for them.

Is it vulgar or refined? Commonplace or strange? Let the world’s judgments decide. What reckoning do I have? What reckoning indeed.

**Later Traditions**
**○ Divine Transformations and Marvels**
**◇ Selling Ink in Wuchang**
Lü Dongbin wandered to Wuchang, disguising himself as an ink merchant. Each inkstick, no longer than a finger’s width, bore a price of three thousand coins. None sold. The crowd jeered and mocked.

A strongman named Wang declared, “The ink is small, yet the price is steep—could there be some hidden purpose?” He offered three thousand coins for a single stick. Lü then drank heavily with the man until, drunk, he stumbled home and fell into a stupor.

At midnight, a knock came at the door. The guest had returned the money and departed. By dawn, the inkstick had transformed into a bar of refined gold, bearing the character *Lü*. The merchant was sought everywhere, yet nowhere to be found.

**◇ Selling Combs in Wuchang**
Lü Dongbin roamed to Tianxin Bridge in Wuchang, concealing his name and hawking worn wooden combs for a thousand coins each. Days passed with no sales.

Then an old beggar woman appeared—over eighty, frail and hunched, her hair white as snow. The Patriarch sighed, “People cling to what lies before their eyes. They see me selling shabby goods at a high price and suspect some deeper meaning, yet among thousands, none possess the insight to perceive it. How then can they be spoken to of the Dao?”

The Patriarch then took the comb and combed the old woman’s hair. With each stroke, her hair grew longer, turning black as it cascaded to the ground, while her withered form grew youthful. The onlookers, struck with awe, clamored to buy his combs. Lü Dongbin smiled and said, “They see yet do not recognize; they recognize yet do not see.” With that, he cast the comb into the river below. It transformed into a blue-green dragon and soared away.

**◇ Water Transformed into Wine**
Ma Shan, a native of the Eastern Capital, failed the imperial examinations in the early Xining era and turned to the study of the Dao. One day, while traveling along the Bian River with a Daoist named Hou, they encountered a feathered immortal—clad in a blue-green headscarf and plain robe, his bearing refined, his bones extraordinary, his eyes bright as limpid water, his face untouched by dust.

Ma invited him to share tea and a meal. Hou, by nature quick to anger, rebuked him. The immortal said, “I possess the art of immortality.” Hou pressed him for details. The immortal asked, “What arts do *you* know?” Hou replied, “I can summon spirits with flying talismans, transmute stone into gold, and return money or jade to their owners.” The immortal said, “What you do is not the true Way.” Hou demanded, “Then what can *you* do?” The immortal answered, “I can strengthen my *qi* and purify my spirit.” Hou asked, “What does it mean to strengthen one’s *qi*?” The immortal said, “Simply observe.” He exhaled toward a wineshop, extinguishing its candles from dozens of yards away. Then he exhaled upon Hou’s face, sending a gust like a gale that left him trembling and unable to stand. Both men rose and bowed, saying, “Master, you are no ordinary man. We humbly seek your instruction.”

The immortal said, “To study immortality, one must establish merit and conduct. Merit lies in diligence and arduous cultivation; conduct lies in aiding others and benefiting all things.” Hou said, “Throughout my life, I have healed people with medicine—is this not merit and conduct?” The immortal replied, “You take lives to save lives, killing one to give life to another. It would be better to cure illness with talismanic water alone.” As dawn broke, the immortal took his leave, saying, “I shall return to the banks of the Xiang River. Let us part with a drink beneath the willow’s shade.” He gave Hou a hundred taels of silver to buy wine. Finding no wine available, the immortal produced a bottle and instructed Hou to fetch a bottle of Bian River water. He dropped in a single pill, and at once it turned into fine wine. The three drank deeply and became thoroughly intoxicated. The immortal left behind a poem:

*Three mouths share one chamber,*
*By its side, waters run clear.*
*Born to wander the world,*
*This is both surname and name.*

After parting, the two pondered the poem and realized he was Dongbin.

◇ **Square Holes in Paper**
Zhao Yingdao of the Directorate for the Advancement of Literature suffered from scrofula and was near death. Weeping, he bid farewell to his family and friends, saying, “I am dying. I can part with all the treasures in my chambers, but my white-haired parents have no one to rely on—what is to be done?” Before he could finish speaking, a Daoist knocked at the door and said to Zhao, “Your illness is not difficult to cure.” He took two sheets of paper, pinched the center of each to form two square holes roughly two *chi* in size, and handed them to Zhao, saying, “At night, burn one sheet to extinguish the disease, then apply a paste of frankincense to the sores. Keep the other sheet for those who come after.” With that, the Daoist vanished. Zhao then understood that the two square holes formed the character *lü* (吕).

◇ **Square Holes in Stone**
Lou Daoming of Zitong was wealthy and skilled in the arts of *xuansu*. He kept ten young maidens, dismissing each as soon as she became pregnant and replacing her with a new one. He maintained no fewer than ten at all times, taking them day and night without rest. Yet his spirit remained clear, his body robust, and his complexion as rosy as a peach blossom. He could go days without eating. At ninety-seven, he appeared no older than thirty. He was especially fond of boasting and exaggeration. When drinking with guests, he would claim that the Mysterious Woman had sent wine, or the Plain Girl had sent fruit, or that Peng Zu and Rong Cheng had bequeathed him texts, insisting he was a true immortal.

One day, Dongbin disguised himself as a beggar and came to his door. Lou, not recognizing him, shouted at him to leave. Dongbin pressed his feet upon a stone, instantly carving two square holes three *cun* deep. Lou was astonished and invited him to sit at his side, saying, “You are no ordinary man.” He summoned his maidservants to sing *Songs of Roaming Immortals* and ordered wine to be served. Dongbin improvised a *Wang Jiangnan* lyric in response:

*At Jasper Pool,*
*Auspicious mists gather the immortals.*
*White-clad golden youths strike phoenix clappers,*
*Green-robed jade maidens play simurgh pipes—*
*One dwells in the Great Brahma Heaven.*
*In drunken reverie,*
*One floats to the Jade Capital Mountain.*
*The hymns of void-stepping end the feast,*
*Yet one knows not what year this evening is,*
*For the seas have turned to mulberry fields.*

The maidservants presented Shu paper, asking him to write. Dongbin wrote from the bottom of the page to the top, filling every space without leaving gaps. Lou was greatly astonished and delighted, and was about to ask his Daoist name when Dongbin said, “I have already transmitted it mouth to mouth.” Lou pressed further, and he repeated, “I have already transmitted it mouth to mouth.” Suddenly, he ascended to the top of a cypress tree outside the gate and vanished. Several days later...

Suddenly, Lou fell gravely ill, vomiting several pints of silvery phlegm before passing away. The "mouth-to-mouth transmission" and the two square cavities in the stone were both veiled references to the character *Lu* (吕).

◇ **Painting a Mountain at Luofu**
Dongbin traveled to the Vermilion Bright Abbey at Mount Luofu and arrived at a small hermitage. The Daoist master was away, leaving only a young novice behind. The boy bowed and asked, “Has the master come to visit?” Then he secretly took the Daoist’s wine and offered it to Dongbin. Dongbin drank sparingly, then urged the boy to finish the rest, but the boy refused. The novice had long suffered from cataracts in his eyes. Dongbin sprayed the remaining wine onto his eyes, and suddenly his vision cleared as if he had never been afflicted. Dongbin then took up a brush and painted a mountain on the wall, with three pools at its base. He told the boy, “If you drink my wine, you will attain immortality. If not, it is fate—yet you will still enjoy a long life.” With that, he flew into the stone wall and vanished. When the Daoist master returned and saw the painted mountain extending through the wall, he exclaimed in astonishment, “The three pools at the base form the character *yan* (嵓). Could this have been Master Lü?” Later, the boy indeed lived to the age of one hundred and fifty before passing away.

◇ **Tempering the Sword at Mount Lu**
Dongbin visited the True Silence Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou, where he tempered his sword by the steps. The Daoist Hou Yonghui asked him, “Master, what is this sword for?” Dongbin replied, “To eliminate all injustices in the world.” Hou found his words strange and invited him to drink wine and eat fruit. He remarked, “Master, your Daoist demeanor is lofty—you cannot be an ordinary man of this world.” Dongbin said, “Let us drink heartily; do not press me with questions.” Once drunk, he wrote a poem on the wall with the tip of his chopstick:

*Dare I shrink from toil to hone my blade?*
*At dawn, the jade dragon roars when the case is opened.*
*In my hand, its qi freezes three feet of ice;*
*On stone, its spirit coils like a serpent.*
*Tyrants’ blood silently follows the flowing water;*
*Villains’ stains now dissolve with the fading marks.*
*To cut down the world’s injustices,*
*I shall ascend with you to the Nine Heavens.*

When he finished, the words seemed invisible at first, yet the ink shone brilliantly through to the other side of the wall. Hou was astonished and bowed deeply, then asked about the sword’s method. Dongbin said, “There is the *Dao-sword* and the *Dharma-sword*. The *Dao-sword* moves in and out without form, while the *Dharma-sword* is wielded through technique—this is what common eyes perceive, and it can only dispel demons and banish malevolent spirits.” Hou asked, “If one were to slay evil men with the *Dao-sword* amidst a crowd, would it not shock the world?” Dongbin replied, “Man’s spirit is his mother, and qi his child. When the spirit remains, qi gathers; when the spirit departs, qi scatters. Strike the spirit, and the qi will leave—the man will vanish of his own accord, or borrow another’s form. All such cases follow this principle.” Hou sighed, “These are truly the words of an immortal. May I know your name?” Dongbin said, “I am Lü Yan.” With that, he cast his sword into the air and ascended with it.

◇ **Celestial Music at the Feast**
In Luoyang, Chen Zhizhong built a grand estate in the Eastern Capital, where he gathered friends and family for a feast. Suddenly, a ragged Daoist arrived—it was Dongbin. Chen asked, “What skills do you possess?” Dongbin replied, “I have a set of celestial music. I would like to perform it to grace your splendid gathering.” From his waist, he produced a scroll of paintings and hung it on a pillar. It depicted twelve celestial maidens, each holding a musical instrument. Dongbin called to them, and they descended like a string of pearls, lining up before him. Two maidens held banners to lead the procession, while the others played music. Their skin was like jade, their faces like flowers, their voices delicate and sweet. They wore seven-jeweled crowns, gossamer robes, golden pendants, and jade ornaments that chimed softly as they moved. Each had a grain of yellow jade on the bridge of her nose, and their bodies were ethereal, unlike mortal beings. The music soared clear and bright through the misty heavens, its melodies unlike anything of this world.

When the three suites concluded, Chen asked, “What manner of women are these?” The Daoist replied, “They are the Six Jia and Six Ding Jade Maidens. When one perfects the Dao, the three hun and seven po within the body, along with the spirits of the five viscera and six bowels, all transform into such beings. Would you, sir, also wish to cultivate this path?” Chen, deeming it mere illusion and deception, felt deeply displeased. The Daoist turned to the maidens and said, “You may depart.” They then ascended back into the scroll. The Daoist took the scroll, opened his mouth, and swallowed it whole. He then demanded paper and brush and wrote in large characters:

*Through three thousand kalpas in the heavens I’ve passed,*
*Five hundred years among men I’ve spent at last.*
*At my waist, a sword-blade flashes purple lightning bright,*
*In the crucible, elixir flames rise in smoky might.*
*Once I rode a white deer o’er the boundless sea,*
*Now astride a blue ox, I enter grottoes free.*
*Such small arts are but trifles, a fleeting play—*
*None know I am a true immortal today.*

At the end, he signed: “Written by the Valley Guest.” He then stepped out the door and vanished in an instant. Chen exclaimed, “The Valley Guest must have been Dongbin!” Overcome with remorse, he wished to gouge out his own eyes, and not long after, he passed away.

◇ **A Brush Shaft Floats on the Waves**
Lu Dongbin’s calligrapher friend, Master Zhai, delighted in hosting knights-errant. Dongbin went to visit him and was received with the utmost courtesy, lodging in Zhai’s home. From then on, he came and went for over a year. One day, he took Zhai to the riverside, snapped a brush shaft in two, and set the pieces afloat on the waves. Dongbin stepped onto one half, urging the calligrapher to do the same. Terrified, Zhai dared not move forward. Dongbin laughed and crossed the water, reaching the opposite shore before vanishing. Only then did Zhai realize he was an extraordinary being. Ten days later, Dongbin returned, bringing food for Zhai—but all of it was rotten and foul. Zhai covered his nose and declined to eat. Dongbin sighed deeply and said, “Since you cannot stomach coarse fare, I shall leave you two jars of meat sauce.” He then departed and was never seen again. When Zhai opened the jars, he found them filled with gold flakes. Were not “two jars” simply two large vats?

◇ **The Sliced Fish Revives**
While traveling through Lushan, Dongbin stopped at a wineshop where he saw a fish being butchered for sashimi. He declared, “I can make this fish live again.” The sashimi-maker did not believe him. Dongbin placed a single pill into the fish’s belly, and after a long while, the fish leapt and writhed as if alive. Astonished, the man released it into the river, where it swam away, vigorous and free. Dongbin had already disappeared.

○ **Renaming and Enlightenment**
◇ **Hui the Recluse**

◇ **The Ancient Iron Mirror**

The Ministerial Gentleman Jia Shixiong kept an ancient iron mirror, which he once wished to temper and polish. Dongbin, styling himself as Recluse Hui, paid him a visit and begged to test his skill. From his bamboo case, he took a small measure of powder and placed it upon the mirror. Then he took his leave, saying, “Wait while I fetch more elixir.” When pursued, he was nowhere to be found. Only at the gate of the Taiping Temple where he had lodged was a poem inscribed:

*In hand, a green serpent soars beneath the white sun,*
*Within the grotto, immortal fruits bloom with eternal spring.*
*Know that the mist-and-clouds wanderer dwells beyond the world—*
*Not one who grinds mirrors amid the dust.*

When they looked at the mirror, the powder had already vanished, leaving only a single spot of luminous brilliance like jade.

◇ **Daoist Hui**

While traveling in Changsha, Dongbin disguised himself as Daoist Hui, carrying a small clay jar to beg for coins. Though he received countless coins, the jar never filled, and people all marveled at him. One day, seated in the marketplace, he declared, “Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall be taught the Dao.” People vied to toss coins into the jar, yet it never filled. A monk, driving a cartload of coins, jested, “Can your jar hold all this?” The Daoist assented. As the cart was pushed into the jar, it clattered loudly—then suddenly vanished. The monk exclaimed, “Was that a divine immortal’s doing—or mere illusion?”

---

The Daoist then improvised a poem:
Neither god nor immortal am I,
Neither art nor illusion this.
Heaven and earth shall one day end,
Mulberry fields shift and change again.
The body was never truly mine—
Why cling to what cannot remain?
Why not follow me and roam,
Riding the whale through boundless space?

The monk grew even more astonished and doubtful, attempting to seize him. The Daoist said, “Do you regret these coins? I shall repay you now.” He took a slip of paper, tossed it into the jar, and prayed, “Quickly push the cart out.” After a long while, nothing emerged. He said, “I must retrieve it myself,” and leapt into the jar, vanishing without a sound. The monk struck the jar to pieces and found a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:

To seek the true, first know the true,
Yet seeing it, you fail to wake.
A laugh, and we meet once more—
Driving your cart on Dongping’s road.

The monk returned in dismay, and as he reached Dongping, he suddenly saw the Daoist, who said, “I have awaited you for some time.” He returned the cart, coins all intact, and said, “I am Master Lü. At first, I thought you could be taught. But now, so attached to money, you cannot.” The monk began to repent and apologize, but it was too late.

◇ **Turning the Heart**

In Anfeng County, the courtesan Cao Erxiang contracted a loathsome illness and was made to lodge travelers in an inn. Dongbin, disguised as a destitute scholar, sought shelter there. The servant, seeing his ragged clothes, refused him. Erxiang said, “Since I have taken up this profession, what does filth or cleanliness matter?” She welcomed him in and treated him with great courtesy. Soon after, Cao’s illness flared, and she groaned in agony. Dongbin took a pair of chopsticks and pricked her thigh, saying, “Turn your heart, turn your heart.”

Outside the gate stood a soapberry tree, long withered and dead. Dongbin cast medicine upon it and departed. The next day, the tree revived, its branches and leaves lush and thriving. Only then did Cao realize he was an immortal—and that “turning the heart” referred to Lü. She cast off her headdress and robes, washed away her powder and rouge, abandoned her home, and journeyed far away. The people built a shrine to Master Lü and offered him worship.

At the end of the Shaoxing era, Cao suddenly returned to her hometown, her appearance refined and radiant, unrecognized by anyone. She recounted her story from beginning to end, then left again, her fate unknown.

◇ **The Unattached Elder Chang**

On Mount Dayu of Hengpu, a wealthy young man, enamored of the Dao, built a hermitage to receive wandering scholars for many years. One day, as the assembly had just completed a grand *Gulu* vegetarian feast, a ragged Daoist arrived seeking alms. The crowd showed no compassion, some even insulting him. The Daoist inscribed a *ci* poem:

"A brief sojourn at Dayu—
Who speaks with the white crane that comes?
By the ridge’s homesteads,
How many winters has the plum blossom seen?

Spring arrives, spring departs,
One lingers where fallen flowers meet flowing waters.
Flowers fill the front stream,
Hiding all immortals from mortal sight."

At the end he inscribed: *"The Unattached Elder Chang has come."* The five characters were written in three distinct styles. When he finished, he stepped into the Cloud Terrace and did not reemerge. After a long while, they searched for him, but he had vanished. Upon closer inspection, his writing had penetrated through to the other side of the wall. Only then did they realize that the character *Chang* was written without its "heart" (无心). He was none other than Master Lü. The assembly sighed in awe and regret.

◇ **Venerable Bin**

At the Hermitage of the Venerable Elder on Mount Qingcheng, Huang Ruogu was a man of refined bearing, strict discipline, and spotless conduct. He often used the *Tianxin* talismanic water and the *Three Lights* true talismans to treat illnesses, and whatever money or silk he received, he immediately distributed to the poor.

Lü Dongbin, disguised as Venerable Bin of the Upper Retreat, stayed for over a month. The talismans and registers he crafted would often rise into the air, transforming into dragons, serpents, clouds, and mist before flying away. When he summoned generals to expel ghosts, their forms would manifest, and they spoke in human tongues. His footsteps shook the earth like thunder, his gaze flashed like lightning, his breath formed clouds, and his spittle became rain.

He was also skilled in painting, requiring neither brush nor ink. He would merely hold inked water in his mouth and spray it onto silk or paper, naturally forming landscapes, flowers, trees, palaces, birds, beasts, and human figures—only a light touch was needed to refine them. Whenever he earned money from his paintings, he would buy wine and drink heartily with Ruogu. Though Ruogu could hold his liquor without limit, he was always bested by Bin.

One day, Ruogu asked, "Master, your conduct is unlike that of ordinary men. You must have come from among the immortals. Can you speak to me of the Dao?"

Bin replied, "The seven stars of the Northern Dipper on your left foot lack one—how could you attain the Dao? Another lifetime will be needed."

Ruogu exclaimed in astonishment, "Master Bin must be a sage!" For beneath his left foot was a birthmark shaped like the Northern Dipper, missing one star—a fact no one had ever known.

Ruogu then asked, "How long is my lifespan?"

Dongbin wrote ninety-four characters in reverse on the wall, enclosing them within two interlocking circles, then took his leave. Only later did Ruogu realize that the two circles formed the character *Lü*, and *Bin* was his given name. At forty-nine, Ruogu passed away, fulfilling the prophecy of the reversed inscription.

◇ **Huang the Auspicious Elder**

Zhong Jiang of Zhongshan in Changsha, having resigned from office in Jiankang during the Ji-Si year of the Jiading era, was returning home by boat. He stopped at Nanjin in Baling...

As dusk approached, a boat suddenly passed by. On board stood an elder in a yellow robe, his bearing and countenance extraordinarily refined. He stood motionless, gazing intently at Zhongshan for a long while. Zhongshan peered into the boat’s canopy and saw no other belongings—only ten black jars lined up at the bow, and two young attendants in blue-green robes standing unevenly before the canopy. Zhongshan assumed he was merely crossing the ferry. Yet after the boat had traveled no more than two *zhang*, it turned its oars and returned, the yellow-robed elder once again seated upright behind the canopy. He fixed his gaze on Zhongshan for another long while, then suddenly the boat vanished without a trace. Zhongshan had initially taken him for a wealthy merchant and had not spoken to him, but now he was struck with astonishment, realizing this was no ordinary man.

The next day, Zhongshan went to Lüxian Temple to pay homage before the true image of the immortal. There, he saw the figure clad in a yellow robe, with two young attendants in blue-green standing beside him—his appearance and even their faces were an exact match to what he had witnessed the day before. Zhongshan lamented his mortal eyes for failing to recognize a true immortal and sighed endlessly. Later, Zhou Xing composed a *shuidiao getou* lyric, which included the lines: *"As if at Nanjin Port, / Once more I meet Lord Lü’s boat."*

The following year, Zhongshan passed away. His grandson later showed me a portrait of the yellow-robed elder painted by his grandfather, its refinement and transcendent elegance truly unmatched.

◇ **Seeking Audience at the Confucian Gate**
◇ **An Audience with Prefect Wang of Yuezhou**

The Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, Ren Lun, was serving as Prefect of Yuezhou when a Daoist monk named Hui sought an audience. His appearance was striking, with his shins exposed, and his voice clear and resonant. Lun inquired about his lineage. Hui replied, "My lineage is of no consequence. What I seek to discuss is the game of *weiqi*." They played, and though Lun was renowned as a master of the board, he suffered repeated defeats. As dusk fell, Lun offered him wine and asked, "Where are you from?" Hui wrote a poem in response:

*Lineage and name are plainly recorded,*
*Yet I, a weary traveler from Penglai, am Master Lü.*
*How much can mortal eyes truly perceive?*
*They fail to recognize the old tree spirit south of the city.*

Before Lun could recover from his astonishment, Hui had vanished. A mist of swirling clouds lingered in the courtyard for some time before dissipating.

◇ **An Audience with Secretary Shi**

Secretary Shi, Wang Xiu, was avoiding the summer heat when a ragged woodcutter approached, axe in hand. His features were refined, his speech sharp and lucid. Shi asked about his hometown and lineage. The woodcutter replied, "I was born in Henan but later moved to Mount Zhongnan. I am a descendant of Lü Wei. My studies are confined to the *Zhuangzi* and the *Daodejing*; beyond these, I have no other pursuits." Shi asked, "What does Zhongnan Mountain possess?" The woodcutter answered with a verse:

*What does Zhongnan hold?*
*It holds but white clouds.*
*These bring joy to me alone—*
*They cannot be gifted to you.*

Shi found him extraordinary and detained him for two days, discussing methods to transcend life and death. As they parted, the woodcutter said, "I am bound for Yueyang." He left Shi with a single elixir pellet to consume. Shi lived to over ninety, yet his vitality remained like that of an infant.

◇ **Defying Authority in Baling**

Lü Dongbin was walking through the Baling market when the Prefect emerged.

**Defying Authority in Baling (continued)**

The Prefect’s vanguard seized him. The Prefect imprisoned him and ordered him to write a confession by sundown, yet by dusk, not a single word had been set down. The jailer pressed him. Lü Dongbin said, “Wait until I sober up.” The jailer said, “Do you not fear punishment? And you still seek solace in wine?” Before he finished speaking, Lü vanished without a trace, leaving only a sheet of paper inscribed with a poem:

*For a time I roamed the seas of Penglai,*
*By chance I met the Prefect, who asked my origin.*
*I dwell beneath the Dipper’s handle,*
*My sword hangs at the moon’s horn in the Southern Palace.*
*When I say I’m drunk, I am truly drunk—*
*How could I know what sorrow is?*
*Why did we meet yet not recognize each other?*
*I ride the white clouds back and depart.*

The Prefect, startled, exclaimed, “This is Lord Lü!” At dawn, he burned incense and begged forgiveness. One day, Lü appeared in a basin of water. The Prefect hastily summoned a painter to capture his likeness, which bore a striking resemblance to the portrait of Teng Zijing.

◇ **Visiting Daoist Abbeys**

**A Visit to Taiping Abbey**
At Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, a Daoist of lofty aspirations resided. Lü Dongbin visited him and presented a poem:

*Fallen and carefree, Scholar Xue,*
*Advanced in years yet beardless still.*
*In clouds he idly lies on stone,*
*In mountains he coldly seeks old steles.*
*He boasts of drinking great wine,*
*Scorns those who recite petty verse.*
*What manner of man is he?*
*Let the crowd mock as they will.*

At the end, he inscribed in small script: *“Written by Daoist Hui when visiting Master Xue the Alchemist with three companions.”* Only then was it known that *Hui* was Lü’s sobriquet.

**A Visit to Tianqing Abbey**
At Tianqing Abbey in Fulixian, Suzhou, a Daoist named Ning, though young, discoursed on the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi* with extraordinary insight. One morning, a traveling medicine-seller arrived—it was Lü Dongbin, his bearing majestic. He stayed for over a month, then imparted the essentials of the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi* to the Daoist: *“I observe that all Chan teachings derive from Laozi and Zhuangzi. Though there be thousands of sutras and myriad volumes, with endless debates and distinctions, they all establish their own schools, trace their lineages, and transmit their doctrines—yet in truth, they all stem from the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi.”* Before departing, he inscribed two quatrains on the door in large seal script, the brushwork bold and dynamic. They read:

Amidst autumn’s desolate scene, leaves swirl in chaotic flight,
Beneath the pine’s shadow in the courtyard, time slips by as I sit.
Clouds obscure the crane-drawn chariot—where has it gone?
The immortal grotto’s morning audience has passed me by.

Second quatrain:
From age to age, the script of immortals transmits its thousand-year arts,
Mouth reciting the two-scroll *Huangting Jing*.
Within the crane’s abode, by the ancient altar amid pine shadows,
All is hushed—no footprints, the door ever barred.

After his departure, people scraped the characters to treat illnesses, and many were cured. The strokes penetrated over an inch into the wood, the ink traces indelible.

At Tianqing Abbey in Qinzhou, when Lü Dongbin visited, all the Daoist clerics had gone to the capital’s jiao rites, leaving only a young novice behind. Dongbin asked for a brush to inscribe the wall. The novice declined, saying, *“The abbey halls are newly renovated; the master forbade defacing the walls.”* Dongbin replied, *“Then trouble yourself to tend the incense burner in the Three Clarities’ hall—I wish to pay my respects.”*

Once there, he saw the limpid water of a pond behind the hall and, with his fingernail, etched into the wall:
*This stone pond’s clear water mirrors my heart,*
*Yet peach blossoms’ shadows plunge it into turmoil.*
*Once within the palace halls of Guishan,*
*I dissipate idle thoughts and still my mind with the seven-stringed zither.*

At the end, he inscribed: *“Written by Hui after returning.”* The wall was exceedingly high, beyond the reach of human hands. The crowd marveled, then realized *Hui* was Lü’s courtesy name, and *“after returning”* referred to the master’s return. Later, the master opposed this.

---

At a mountain temple, playing among the monks’ quarters:
A transformation in a monastic temple.

Lu Dongbin once wandered into a mountain temple, where he transformed his sword into a ravishing woman who entered the monastery. The monks’ eyes followed her in rapture, their spirits scattered and wills undone. As she passed the meditation hall, one monk sat cross-legged apart, paying her no heed, and walked straight out the gate as though untouched by desire. “This one is teachable,” thought Lu.

Once outside, he awaited the monk in a secluded spot, intending to waylay and provoke him. Beauty ensnares the senses—how hard it is to uproot the seeds of karmic entanglement. This was the first chapter of their Daoist affinity.

---

Lu Dongbin arrived at Jin’e Temple in Siming, where the abbot’s quarters stood stark and empty. Presently, a novice emerged. Lu asked, “Why so desolate?” The boy replied, “Do not call it desolate—it is emptiness itself.” Pleased by his words, Lu inscribed a poem on the wall:

*The abbot’s door stands ever ajar,*
*Yet here a mountain boy bares his feet.*
*I ask why the abbot’s quarters lie so still—*
*He says, “Emptiness, yet not even that.”*

Hearing this, how could one not rejoice?
Was the master no ordinary man?
I came to pay my respects but found him gone—
My seeking heart burns bright with dust and longing.

I return now, crossing the boundless expanse,
My path leading to Penglai’s distant peaks.
When next I climb the stone tower,
Snow will gleam, the sea stretch wide, and a thousand summits dawn.

---

At a temple on Mount Lu, the monk Fazhen of Kaiyuan Monastery had sat in meditation for twenty years, his precepts and conduct beyond reproach. One day, as he sat in samadhi, a Daoist appeared and asked, “Master, do you believe the Dao is found only in sitting?” Fazhen replied, “Yes.” The Daoist said, “The Buddha strictly forbids greed, anger, lust, and killing. While sitting, you may feel free of such thoughts, but when confronted with sights and objects, you cannot master yourself—these impulses scatter like wild horses. Can the Dao truly reside in sitting alone?”

He led Fazhen to the meditation hall, where a monk lay fast asleep. “Let us sit here awhile and observe him,” the Daoist said. After some time, a small snake, over three inches long, emerged from the sleeping monk’s crown, slithered down the bedpost to the floor, and devoured his spittle. It then drank from his chamber pot before gliding outside. Crossing a small ditch, it coiled around a flower terrace as if lingering in delight. When it attempted to cross another ditch, the water had risen, forcing it to retreat. The Daoist blocked its path with a small blade planted in the earth. The snake recoiled, found a side route to the bed’s right post, and ascended back into the monk’s crown.

The sleeping monk suddenly awoke and greeted the Daoist and Fazhen, saying, “I just had a dream. Let me tell you both: I dreamed I left through the left gate and came upon an exquisite feast, which I ate. Then I found fine wine and drank my fill. Lifting my robes, I crossed a small river outside the gate, where I met dozens of beautiful women and indulged in pleasure. I tried to cross another river, but the water had surged, blocking my way. A bandit appeared, intent on killing me, so I fled by a shortcut, re-entered through the right gate, and awoke.”

The Daoist and Fazhen laughed heartily. The Daoist said, “The bedpost was your gate, the spittle your feast, the urine your wine, the ditch your river, the flowers and trees your women, and the blade your bandit. Such are the illusions of human dreams!” Fazhen asked, “What of the snake?” The Daoist replied, “This monk harbors deep-seated anger and venom. His habitual tendencies have transformed him, assuming the form of a snake. When he closes his eyes in death, he will be reborn as one. How can he not be cautious?”

“I am Lü,” he said.

“Seeing your sincere devotion, I have come to teach you the Way.” Fazhen then followed him, and their destination remained unknown.

◇ *The Gift of the Kaiyuan Era*

At the bathhouse of Kaiyuan Temple in Yuanzhou stood a large well, its spring water sweet and cold. Dongbin grew fond of it and lingered for ten days, befriending the temple monks. The bathhouse monk treated him with utmost respect, unaware that he was Dongbin. Upon departing, Dongbin presented him with a few ink tablets. The monk stored them away without further thought.

One day, Li Dalin, the Transport Commissioner of Jiangxi, arrived in Yuanzhou. He sought out the monk and asked, “Did Master Lü ever gift you gold?” The monk, startled, replied, “I did not recognize Master Lü. A Daoist once visited and gave me ink, but no gold.” He produced the ink to show Li, only to find it had turned to gold. Li, astonished, rubbed the tablets in amazement and offered to exchange them for other gold. The monk refused but presented him with one tablet, asking, “How did the Commissioner learn of this?”

Li recounted, “Yesterday, passing through Lingling, I met He Xiangu, who inquired about Master Lü’s recent activities. She said, ‘Lü recently mentioned, “I stayed long in Yichun and grew close to the monk of Kaiyuan Temple’s bathhouse. Delighted by his Daoist bearing and immortal bones, I left him gold.”’ I heard her words and came to verify them.”

A fortnight later, Lü Dongbin returned and asked the monk, “Where is the ink?” The monk recounted all that had transpired. Dongbin laughed and said, “That woman is too talkative.” Then, taking the monk by the hand, he departed, and their destination remained unknown.

◇ *Gathering for Meals at Dayun Temple*
Dongbin, disguising himself as the recluse Hui, wandered to Dayun Temple, where he joined the communal meals for over a month. He remarked to the monks, “Your meals are most refined, but they lack noodles.” With that, he left. Ten days later, he returned with a small portion of flour, prepared the noodles himself, and served them—enough to sate hundreds of monks. The monks invited the recluse to tea. Citing the poem by Minister Ding, they recited:

*“Petals scatter as the monk’s chopsticks break them,
Clouds follow the guest’s bowl, rounding its rim.”*

The recluse replied, “The lines are fine, but they do not fully capture the essence of tea.” He then inscribed a poem:

*“Two tender leaves and a bud—peerless in quality,
Monks’ craftsmanship refines it with utmost skill.
Hare’s fur, gull’s down: fragrant clouds of white,
Shrimp’s eyes, froth’s waves: delicate ripples unite.
It dispels sleep’s grip, banishing drowsiness from seat and mat,
And infuses the flesh with a pure, invigorating qi.
Born wild in the ravines beyond mortal reach,
It scorns transplantation to the imperial capital.”*

He left the monks with a single cinnabar pellet, saying, “Take this, and you shall never die.” Then he departed. Later, the monks too ascended as immortals.

**◇ Blending with the Marketplace**

**◇ The Wine Shop of Shaozhou**
Outside the city of Shaozhou, an old woman ran a wine shop. One day, a Daoist named Lü came to ask for a drink. Finding no wine left, she gave him a *sheng* of lees-laden dregs. The Daoist asked the price, and she replied, “Twenty coins per *sheng*.” He traced twenty characters onto a purple stone by the door with his finger—when he left, the script had seeped through to the stone’s underside, leaving almost no margin. From then on, crowds gathered like the sea, and the wine shop thrived. Later, a temple named *Jixian Guan* was built on the site.

**◇ The Wine Vessel of Yongkang**
In Yongkang Prefecture, a man named Ni had just opened a winehouse when a Daoist arrived, demanding drink. From dawn till dusk, he consumed over a *dan* of fine wine. The onlookers marveled, and Ni pressed him for payment. The Daoist glared in silence, then collapsed in a drunken stupor. Ni kept watch over him. At the first drum of dawn, the Daoist suddenly rose, seized a brush, and inscribed a poem on the wall:

*“A whale’s gulp, a turtle’s swallow—hundreds of cups,
Which jade mountain rises, which crumbles?
Sober, the sleeves chill with heaven’s wind,
A crimson cloud drifts in from the sea.”*

At the end, he wrote: *“Composed by Yang Chun, Daoist of the Three Mountains.”* He tossed a clod of earth at Ni and strode out. Gazing northeast, he saw a crimson cloud approaching, clapped his hands in laughter, and vanished. When they scraped the wall, the ink had soaked through to the other side; the clod of earth was pure gold. From then on, the winehouse flourished, and they realized Yang Chun was none other than *Chunyang*.

**◇ The Teahouse of Bianjing**
At the end of the Later Zhou, a family named Shi ran a teahouse in Bianjing. Their young daughter, still wearing her hair in childhood braids, served the tea. Lü Dongbin disguised himself as a beggar, coming daily to claim the best seat and demand tea. His clothes were ragged, his flesh caked with filth—scarcely bearable to approach. Yet the girl showed no revulsion, bringing him the finest leaves each time. Her parents grew furious and beat her, but she continued to serve him without complaint for over a month.

One day, Dongbin said to her, *“Can you drink the dregs of the tea I’ve sipped?”* She found it too foul to swallow and poured it onto the ground. Suddenly, an extraordinary fragrance arose. She hastily licked it, and her spirit felt refreshed.

Dongbin said, *“I am Master Lü, no beggar. I regret you cannot finish my leavings, yet I can grant your wishes. Do you desire wealth? Or nobility?”*

“Or long life?” The girl replied, *“I am but a humble girl and know not what nobility entails. To be wealthy and long-lived would suffice.”* Dongbin departed and did not return.

In later years, she indeed rose to prominence. She lived to the age of one hundred and thirty-five before passing.

---

**Yanzhou Brothel**
In Yanzhou, a courtesan named Hou (her surname lost to time) ran an inn to lodge travelers. Dongbin, disguised in rags, sought lodging. He would leave at dawn and return at dusk, invariably drunk, and after a month had yet to pay a single coin. Hou summoned him for tea.

Dongbin said, *“I met Master Zhongli, who told me you are ready to hear of the Dao.”* Hou did not understand and offered him wine instead. Dongbin drank without cease. Hou grew increasingly displeased.

Dongbin stretched out his arm, revealing a hidden golden hairpin. He removed one and had her trade it for wine. Greedy for the gold, Hou asked, *“Will you stay the night after drinking?”* He replied, *“Very well.”* He climbed onto the bed, snoring loudly.

At midnight, Hou approached the bed, but Dongbin pushed her away with his hand. She retreated at once. By dawn, Dongbin had vanished. Examining her body, she found where his hand had touched her—his surname, *Lü*, etched deep into her skin.

Hou awoke to the truth: *“This was Lord Lü! Could it be our bond from a past life? A moment’s hesitation cost me dearly. Has he come to deliver me?”* She cut her hair, donned coarse robes, and set out to find Dongbin, but his whereabouts remained unknown.

---

**Guangling Brothel**
In Guangling, a courtesan named Huang Ying possessed great beauty, and wealthy patrons filled her door. One day, a scholar named Lü sought lodging. Huang rejected him for his ragged, filthy appearance. The scholar inscribed two poems on her screen. The first read:

"Moyu and Xishi share this same body—
pity the young and old are sundered by spring.
One day, a crone with crane-white hair and chicken-skin wrinkles,
today, a maiden of jade countenance and flower-like beauty."

The second read:
"Flowers bloom and flowers fall—both bring sorrow and joy,
as flowers change with time, so too does the person.
Blooming on the branch, they fear the guest’s plucking;
fallen to the ground, who will deign to look?"

The poems inscribed, the scholar vanished in an instant.

◇Eastern Capital Brothel
In the Eastern Capital, a courtesan named Yang Liu was a peerless beauty. A Daoist priest frequented her house, repeatedly offering gold and silk, yet he never once engaged with Yang. One evening, Yang, drunk, pressed herself upon him. The Daoist said: *"Within my body, the precelestial Kan and Li unite—husband and wife join internally, the sacred embryo already formed, the infant soon to be born. How could I still crave external beauty? The joy of internal union far surpasses that of external union."*

Yang found his words strange and astonishing. At the time, the prime minister Zhang Tianjue’s guest, Su, had long been intimate with Yang. She told Su, and Su told Zhang, who hastened to question the Daoist. The Daoist cried out and fled, rushing straight to Qiyun Hermitage, where he entered the hall and did not emerge. After a long while, they forced open the door to search for him, but he had already disappeared. Only a poem remained on the wall:

*"With one breath, the phoenix flute rends the Great Clarity,
a green-robed youth treads the void with celestial song.
The jade tower awakens a thousand-year dream—
on the branch of the peach of immortality, the golden rooster crows."*

Later, the hermitage burned to the ground without a trace, yet the wall bearing the poem stood firm and untouched—another marvel.

◇Crane Assembly at Qingcheng

In the final years of the Shaoxing era, Lü Dongbin attended the Crane Assembly at Mount Qingcheng. He rested at the home of a pastry vendor, who did not recognize him and found him rather peculiar. Dongbin took thick ink and boldly inscribed a poem upon the door’s great wooden panel:

*"Only fear the needle’s heart departs,
true bronze transmutes to gold in flowing water.
At the temples, no white hair appears—
the sturdy steed’s path is hard to follow."*

The four lines concealed the characters for *"Lü Dongbin has come."* The brushwork was mighty and vigorous, its brilliance extraordinary; when carved away, the strokes penetrated through to the wood’s reverse. By then, Dongbin had vanished without a trace. A local named Guan Yunxiang witnessed this and promptly painted his likeness—a gaunt Daoist. Thereafter, the pastry vendor’s business thrived.

◇Hanging One’s Robe at Jiangzhou
At the ritual hall of Prefect Pan in Ruichang County, Jiangzhou, a Daoist once arrived seeking to hang his robe. He carried neither bundle nor umbrella, only a tattered bamboo hat, his appearance coarse and rustic. The hall keeper scorned him, saying, *"With no umbrella or bundle, how can you hang your robe?"* The Daoist replied, *"If you will not permit it, then grant me a cup of tea before I go."* The keeper relented and bade him sit. Upon returning, he found the Daoist seated in the host’s place. Enraged, the keeper demanded, *"Where is your sense of guest and host? What sort of Daoist are you?"* The Daoist departed without a bow, leaving behind his hat. The keeper could not lift it. The assembly then chanted sutras to offer apology, whereupon the hat was raised—beneath it, the character *"Lü"* was inscribed upon the ground. When the sick took earth from the spot and boiled it into a decoction, they recovered at once. Over the years, a well formed there, its bubbling waters shaping the character *"Lü"* upon the surface; when disturbed, the strokes would re-form. The well remains to this day.

◇Cinnabar Medicine for the People
◇Scarlet Silk-Wrapped Remedy

In the Eastern Capital, a plague ravaged the populace for a year. An elderly woman who sold tea at home saw her children and grandchildren all fall ill. One day, a Daoist arrived. The woman treated him kindly and pleaded for her family’s affliction. The Daoist said, *"Await me tomorrow at dawn."* The woman rose early to wait. The Daoist presented a scarlet silk-wrapped remedy and instructed, *"When the illness strikes, have the sufferer hold it, and they will recover. One pill can heal a hundred, but beyond that, it loses its efficacy."* The woman followed his words, and her children and grandchildren were cured. After healing a hundred people, the remedy indeed ceased to work. When she opened the silk pouch, the medicine had vanished—only the three characters *"Lü Dongbin"* remained. Then she knew she had encountered Master Lü.

◇Filial Piety Moves Heaven to Save a Mother
In Tonglu, there was a prefectural officer whose name is forgotten. His mother suffered from a carbuncle on her back, and despite countless remedies, she did not recover. He prayed fervently, and Lü Dongbin was moved by his filial devotion. That night, Lü appeared in his dream and said, *"Your filial piety has touched Heaven, and I am commanded to save her. If you delay by even a day, she cannot be cured."* He then bestowed the recipe for the *"Numinous Treasure Ointment"*: five *gualou* fruits, their seeds removed, and five pieces of frankincense, each the size of a jujube. Grind each ingredient finely, then simmer with one *jin* of white honey to form an ointment. Take three *qian* per dose, dissolved in warm wine. The officer procured the herbs, administered the remedy, and his mother recovered at once. Later, when he shared it with others, it proved instantly effective.

◇The Healing of a Lame Man in Zhaozhou
In Zhaozhou, a poor man named Liu had been lame for twenty years. Each evening, he lit incense and prayed to Heaven. One day, a Daoist carrying an iron ladle approached him and said, *"Follow me."* Liu followed him.

After walking about two *li*, the Daoist pointed to the ground and said, *"Beneath here, three *chi* deep, lies a five-colored stone. Try digging it up."* Sure enough, they unearthed a stone the size of a pellet, its five hues uncommonly radiant. The Daoist said, *"Take it home, expose it to the sun for nine days, then grind it into fine powder. Steep it in a decoction of *mugua* peel and drink. Once healed, come to the third chamber on the left of the eastern corridor of Zhuyun Hall, east of the city, and we shall meet again on its wall."* Liu’s ailment vanished at once. He went to seek the Daoist but saw only an image of Lü Dongbin holding an iron ladle upon the wall.

◇The Healing of Eyes in Jiangling
In Jiangling, a Daoist named Fu revered the image of Lü Dongbin with utmost devotion. On New Year’s Day of the Qiandao era, a guest in square cap and robe entered and conversed with him. After some time, the guest invited him to drink, and Fu accompanied him. Thereafter, the guest visited every ten days. At the time, Fu’s eyes were dim and teary. The guest instructed him to take equal parts of raw and prepared *dihuang*, sliced and baked, along with Sichuan peppercorns—removing stems, seeds, and closed pods—lightly stir-fried. These were to be blended with honey into pills, fifty taken on an empty stomach with salted water. After prolonged use, Fu’s vision cleared. Reflecting on the guest’s appearance, he bore a striking resemblance to the Lü Dongbin image he venerated.

◇Selling Medicine in Yueyang
Lü Dongbin traveled to Yueyang, where he assumed a false name to peddle medicine, pricing each pill at a thousand gold pieces. For three days, none sold. He then ascended Yueyang Tower, consumed his own medicine, and suddenly rose into the air, standing suspended. The crowd, astonished and envious, clamored to buy his pills. Dongbin laughed and said, *"The Dao lies before your eyes, Penglai but a half-step away; yet you grasp the trigger but do not fire, missing what is right before you."* He then recited a poem:

At dawn he roams the Northern Sea, by dusk the verdant Wu;
In his sleeve, a green snake—his qi bold and unrefined.
Thrice he entered Yueyang, yet none knew his face;
Reciting verses, he soared across Dongting Lake.

◇Holding the Elixir in Chengdu
At the medicine market in Chengdu, a Daoist appeared daily—his face grimed, his robes tattered—holding a single elixir pill. He cried out in the streets: *"I am Lü Dongbin. Whoever bows to me twice shall receive this pill."* The crowd deemed him mad, gathering to mock and follow him. The Daoist repeated his offer several times, yet none bowed. He then sat by the fire pit before the Five Manifestations Temple, where children pelted him with tiles and stones. The Daoist laughed and said: *"The world longs to see me. Yet having seen me, they do not recognize me—such is fate."* Lü then consumed the golden elixir himself. Soon, five-colored clouds enveloped him, and in an instant, he vanished. The crowd was filled with remorse.

◇Jue Neng Receives the Elixir
Huang Jue Neng was renowned for his poetry. One day, while seeing a guest off outside the Eastern Capital’s gate at an inn, he encountered a feathered immortal. Huang offered wine and delicacies, and after sharing them, the immortal raised his cup, traced the character *"Lü"* in water, and said: *"Next year, we shall meet in Jiangnan."* The following year, Huang was indeed transferred to an official post in Jiangnan, where he again met Dongbin. The immortal gave him seven large coins, ten medium ones, and three small coins, saying: *"This number must not be increased. I entrust you with this measure of medicine. On New Year’s Day, grind it with wine and consume it. Thus, you may remain free of illness for the year."* Huang followed his instructions, and by seventy-three, his medicine nearly exhausted, he passed away in the Eastern Capital.

◇De Cheng Receives the Elixir
Li De Cheng was skilled in medicine. On a bitterly cold day, he encountered a destitute Daoist, clad in thin robes yet showing no sign of chill. The Daoist entered a wineshop with Li and his companions, seating himself at the head of the table. Li found this strange.

The tavern keeper said, *"Pay for the wine first."* The Daoist went inside and retrieved three wine flasks, saying, *"Each contains a measure of wine money."* The keeper checked and found it so, then poured three measures of wine for him. The Daoist poured and drank, while Li took only one flask—the other two emptied themselves. The Daoist said to Li, *"This is but a minor art. I am Lü Dongbin."* Li was astonished and overjoyed. The Daoist inscribed a quatrain:

*"The Son of Heaven within the ninefold palace is esteemed,
The five ranks of lords beyond its gates are honored.
Yet how can they compare to a ragged, drunken wanderer,
Who does not surrender his life and fate to Heaven and Earth?"*

He then left Li with a single pill of medicine, saying, *"Take this, and you shall enjoy a long life."* They parted at once. Li consumed the pill, and his hair never whitened, his teeth never fell out; he lived to one hundred and seven before passing away.

◇The Healing of Fistula in Jinling
Wan Yushi of Jinling once suffered from a fistula, leaving the left half of his body—hand and foot—paralyzed. For years, he walked with difficulty, and despite countless treatments, the condition remained incurable. One day, while venturing beyond the city’s southern gate, he encountered a Daoist arriving from Pude Mountain, who asked, *"What ails you so?"* Wan told him of his affliction.

The Daoist pressed his hand upon the afflicted area, and suddenly Wan felt a sharp, aching pain. The Daoist said, *"How could this be called a one-sided affliction? It shall soon heal of itself."* When asked his name and style, he replied, *"My surname is Qian, my style Xitun. I lodge at the Qingyuan Abbey."* He then spoke to Wan of the principles of Qian and Kun, Tun and Meng—of the positions of Heaven and Earth, ruler and teacher—all paths that mortals traverse.

Wan returned home, and his ailment vanished at once; he walked as before. He recounted the matter to his friends, who all said, *"Qian is yang; Xitun signifies purity. Could he not be the Pure Yang Immortal?"* Wan then went out again to seek him, but the Daoist was nowhere to be found. Only the image of the Pure Yang Immortal remained.

Recorded in the eleventh month of the *gengwu* year of the Longqing reign.

◇Poetic Inscriptions on Scenery

◇Poem on Yellow Crane Tower
One day, the prefect and his deputy of Wuchang were playing chess when a Daoist, who gave no name, stepped forward and said, *"I am a master of the game."* The prefect invited him to play, and after only eight moves, the Daoist declared, *"The prefect has lost."* The prefect said, *"The game is not yet finished—how do you know I have lost?"* The Daoist replied, *"My pieces have already seized the strategic points; thus I know."* And so it proved. After several games, the prefect lost every one.

Suddenly, he brushed his sleeves and departed, vanishing without a trace. The prefect ordered men to search the city for him and heard that he was playing the flute before the prefectural yamen. As soon as they arrived, the flute’s sound had shifted to the East Gate. When they reached the East Gate, it was heard at the West Gate; at the West Gate, it moved to the South Gate; at the South Gate, to the North Gate. Finally, at the North Gate, the sound came from before Yellow Crane Tower. The Daoist had fled into Stone Reflection Pavilion and disappeared, leaving only a poem in the pavilion that read:

*When the flute played before Yellow Crane Tower,*
*White duckweed and red smartweed filled the river isles.*
*To whom could I pour out my hidden feelings?*
*Only the clear wind and bright moon would know.*

At the end was written a single character: *Lü*.

◇ Karmic Encounters: Met Yet Unmet

◇ He Xiangu Meets a Daoist
He Xiangu was a Daoist maiden from Lingling Market. At thirteen, she followed her companions into the mountains to pick tea when she lost them and wandered, unable to find her way home. Below the eastern peak, she saw a man with a long beard and dark blue eyes, wearing a tall cap and a six-layered robe—it was Lü Dongbin. The maiden prostrated herself repeatedly in haste to bow. Dongbin took out a peach and said, *"You are young and must love fruit. Eat this whole, and one day you will ascend in flight; if not, you will remain earthbound."* Xiangu could only eat half. The bearded man pointed out her way home. When she returned, she thought only a day had passed, but in truth, a month had gone by. From then on, she neither hungered nor suffered bodily leaks, and she could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Later, she departed through *shijie*.

Dongbin once told Xiangu, *"I once wandered Hua Yin Market selling medicine, placing a single elixir among ten thousand other pills. When someone sought medicine, I would reach into the gourd and hand them whatever I grasped, observing their karmic affinity. For days, the ten thousand other pills were taken, but this elixir would fall from my hand the moment I touched it."* He sighed that in the world, those with the bone of immortality were so rare.

◇ A Daoist Friend Lectures on Scriptures
Chen Danran was a wealthy Confucian scholar who longed for the Dao. For years, he invited wandering Daoists to stay, yet never met one who could teach him. Dongbin disguised himself as a laborer, tending Chen’s garden for over a year. His strength in work surpassed that of ordinary men. Chen grew fond of him but treated him only as a hired hand.

One day, Chen and a Daoist friend were discussing the *Yinfu Jing*, reaching the line *"When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse."* They did not understand the meaning of the "killing mechanism." Dongbin, standing nearby, spoke out boldly: *"The living do not live; the dead do not die. To kill the living after it has been born, or to learn death before it has come—this is the way to long life."* Chen was astonished and asked, *"Are you not a laborer? Who taught you such words?"* Then, muttering incoherently, he spoke in riddles that could not be deciphered.

The Daoist friend said, *"Where would a rustic field hand have stolen such words? He does not truly understand them."* Soon after, Dongbin suddenly took his leave, saying, *"I will travel far. I shall return at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month next year."* After he left, all was silent. Later, a villager traveling in Baling encountered him and said, *"Give this message to Master Chen: I am Lü Dongbin. At first, I thought he could be taught the Dao, but upon closer observation, he did not awaken. I will not return."* With that, he walked into the bamboo grove of Lüxian Pavilion and vanished.

On the noon of the fifth day of the fifth month the following year, Chen died suddenly.

◇ The Shaoxing Daoist Assembly
At the Shaoxing *guichou* Daoist assembly on Mount Kuaiji, a Daoist arrived carrying a bamboo hat. When the gathering dispersed, he hung the hat on the wall—though there was nothing to hang it on, it did not fall. He left a poem:

*By chance I rode the Azure Emperor from Penglai,*
*My sword and halberd gleamed across the nine heavens.*
*I stand before you now, yet none recognize me—*
*I leave this hat behind; do not let it sink into obscurity.*

◇ The Patriarch’s Admonition to the World
A speck of goodness—offer others convenience.
A speck of evil—refrain from doing it.
Clothing and food follow fate; joy comes naturally.
Why calculate destiny?
Why consult divination?
Deceiving others brings misfortune; forgiving others brings blessing.
The Heavenly Eye watches clearly; retribution comes swiftly.
Listen well to my words—gods bow, ghosts submit.

*The Peach Blossom Maiden*, also known by its full titles *The Peach Blossom Maiden’s Contest of Yin and Yang* and *The Illustrated Wondrous Book of the Peach Blossom Maiden’s Duel of Dao*, comprises four volumes and sixteen chapters.

Form cannot depart from shadow, nor shadow from form; yang cannot turn from yin, nor yin from yang. Yet if form severs from shadow, it must perish; if yang turns from yin, discord must arise. Thus, this book is titled *Contest of Yin and Yang*—for yang has turned from yin. When yin and yang fall into discord, how can they not contend?

Nevertheless, it is said that form never truly parts from shadow, nor yang from yin. Therefore, though yin and yang may contend at first, in the end they neither turn from nor oppose each other. When they neither turn from nor oppose, their contention ceases. When yin and yang no longer contend, they harmonize as one—entering the realm beyond the ordinary, ascending to sagehood.

Once yin and yang transcend the mundane and attain sagehood, they remain unstained by worldly dust. Unstained by worldly dust, all illusory realms dissolve. This is the grand resolution of *Contest of Yin and Yang*.

Thus, this preface is written.

Newly carved in the first winter month of the wushen year of the Daoguang reign.
Volume One.

**Chapter One**
*The Demon-Quelling Mountain’s Precept Blade Takes Form*
*The Recluse of Zhaoge Offers Divination*

In the age of the Three Sovereigns, there ruled in the northern realm of Julu a king named Jing Le, whose consort, Lady Shan Sheng, carried a child for fourteen months before giving birth to a prince—an incarnation of the Azure Emperor.

In time, the prince grew to manhood, renounced his kingdom, and cultivated the Dao, attaining true fruition. In heaven, he became the Jade Pivot, Celestial Worthy of the Northern Culmen, Master of Teachings; in the middle realm, the Supreme Sage Who Quells Demons; and below, the Perfected Martial and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.

Once, while refining his Dao upon Snow Mountain, he used a precept blade to slit open his belly and wash his intestines. Overcome by the ordeal, he fell into a stupor and cast the blade aside. When immortals later revived him, he forgot to retrieve it. Later, while cultivating truth in Yuanxuan Cave, he found the blade missing and left its sheath behind as a treasure to guard the realm.

Both blade and sheath were gifts from the Azure Emperor to the Thearch—wondrous treasures of free will. For a full hundred years, they absorbed the essence of sun and moon before finally transforming into form. The precept blade refined into a yang body, the sheath into a yin body. The blade concealed itself within Demon-Quelling Mountain to cultivate truth, while the sheath nurtured its nature in Yuanxuan Cave.

After several centuries, the Queen Mother of the Western Pool summoned the sheath to heaven, entrusting it with the governance of the Peach Orchard and bestowing upon it the name Peach Blossom Immortal. The blade, however, had not yet attained true fruition. Harboring resentment, it stirred up mischief in Demon-Quelling Mountain—sometimes spewing flames to rival the sun and moon, other times conjuring clouds and rain without cause. This provoked the wrath of heaven, and celestial soldiers were dispatched to seize the blade and bring it to the Golden Palace, where it was sentenced to execution upon the Demon-Slaying Platform.

Fortunately, the founder of the Daoist teachings, the Most High Lord Lao, took pity on its millennia of arduous cultivation. He interceded at the Golden Palace and took the blade to the Tushita Heaven, where it became a youth attendant tasked with tending the divination box. There, it stole a glimpse of *The True Canon of Heavenly Stems* and secretly descended to the mortal realm.

Its true spirit unobscured, it incarnated into the household of a nobleman of the Shang dynasty, surnamed Zhou and named Qing, who held the office of Grand Minister. He took a wife of the Feng clan, and at the age of fifty, she bore him a son. Before the child’s birth, Lady Feng dreamed of a room ablaze with radiant light. Upon waking, she gave birth to a prince, whom they named Zhou Qian.

His face was dark as a cauldron’s bottom, his brows sharp as swords, and from infancy, his eyes shone with divine light. At seven, while playing in the garden, a celestial being descended from the sky and bestowed upon him a book of heavenly scripture. Possessing deep karmic roots, he comprehended it at a glance and gained mastery over past and future, the summoning of spirits, and the arts of cloud-riding and mist-traversing.

By thirty, both his parents had passed, and Zhou Qian inherited his father’s office. The world called him the Duke of Zhou, and his integrity won the respect of all officials. Yet seeing the Shang king’s waywardness, he repeatedly submitted memorials of remonstrance, only for the king to ignore them. Disheartened, he grew despondent.

One day after court, sitting alone in his estate, he mused: *“If I cannot guide the king to righteousness nor sacrifice myself for the realm, how can I remain among the common herd? Why not resign my post, withdraw to Zhaoge, and find a secluded place to open a divination stall, guiding the people? Let me become a leader in expounding the primordial, a master in elucidating the Eight Trigrams. Though I may not serve the nation or its people, my name shall endure for ten thousand generations—is this not good?”*

His resolve firm, he composed his resignation memorial by lamplight. At the fifth watch, he attended court, stepped forward from the ranks, and presented it to the throne. The Shang king, weary of his forthright admonitions, was overjoyed at his departure and approved his request.

Zhou Qian hastened home, gathered his valuables, locked his estate, and departed with his family for a quiet and refined dwelling in Zhaoge. There, he found himself carefree and unbound, at perfect ease.

A poem bears witness:
*“Men deem officialdom the world’s great marvel,*
*Yet I know reclusion holds heaven’s design.”*

With mist-wreathed mountains as his companions, he knew no fear—no longer did he endure the ceaseless toil of mind and heart by day and night.

After some ten days of leisure, Zhou Gong summoned an elderly steward. This man, named Jian Pengjian, had once served as a retainer to a senior minister. Honest and without deceit, he had followed Zhou Gong into reclusion, content to draw water and tend vegetables. Hearing his master’s call, he hastened to the great hall, bowed, and asked, “My lord, what task do you have for Pengjian?”

Zhou Gong replied, “Since I abandoned office to dwell in seclusion here, I have failed to serve the nation or its people, forsaking the legacy of my ancestors. Now, I wish to forge a new path and become a man of uncommon purpose. I intend to establish an enterprise here. You shall open a side gate on the left of the main entrance, seal off three adjoining chambers, and prepare them with utmost cleanliness. Place a seat within—make haste, for this must be done swiftly!”

Pengjian laughed and said, “My lord, I have never seen a noble lord or high minister take up trade or craft.”

Zhou Gong smiled in return. “I do not mean to engage in trade or craft. I shall open a divination stall to guide the foolish, that they may refrain from wickedness. Yet I fear crowds may disturb my peace, so I have devised a method: each divination shall cost one tael of silver. First, the seeker must give you the silver, and only then may they enter to see me and have their fortune told. No more than ten consultations a day—any beyond that shall not be entertained. If someone comes, they must first give you three *fen* of silver as a fee for your service. What say you to this?”

Upon hearing this, Pengjian stood by in silence, only lowering his head with a faint smile. Zhou Gong asked, “Why do you not speak a word?”

Pengjian replied with a laugh, “It is not that I refuse to answer, but how could Your Lordship, a man second only to the sovereign and above ten thousand others, stoop to such a base endeavor? First, it would diminish your noble stature; second, it might sow confusion among the people; and third, no one would dare approach for a divination. Moreover, the fee is far too steep—why go through this charade at all?”

Zhou Gong said, “You do not understand my intent. How does expounding the primordial Dao diminish my stature? How does guiding the foolish confuse the masses? I fear only that my divinations may lack efficacy—if they prove true, the seekers will trample one another to reach my door. Do not concern yourself; go and see to the preparations!”

With no choice, Pengjian had no option but to summon craftsmen to begin the work. Within days, all was ready, and he returned to report to Zhou Gong, “The divination stall is complete.” He then smiled and added, “Though Your Lordship demands a tael of silver per divination, if the readings are accurate, the fee will be justified. But if they are not, will you not be ridiculed? They will say Your Lordship is no good, extorting silver from the people with some trick to deceive them.”

Zhou Gong laughed and said, “I have my reasons—if a divination proves false, I shall repay tenfold!”

Pengjian exclaimed, “That will not do! Your Lordship may afford to repay tenfold, but the three *fen* I receive will be difficult to repay at such a rate. Please do not make sport of me!”

Zhou Gong smiled again. “You do not yet know the divine power of my Eight Trigrams—they are never the slightest bit in error. Even your share shall be repaid by me. What say you now?”

Upon hearing this, Pengjian was overjoyed. He promptly kowtowed, then rose to his feet. Zhou Gong ordered a large bamboo tablet to be brought, took up the brush himself, and inscribed in bold characters: **"The Principles of the Trigrams Communicate with the Divine."** On the left, he wrote in smaller script: *"Foreknowing life and death, fortune and misfortune,"* and on the right: *"Divination fee: one tael of silver; messenger’s commission: three fen."*

He then took another large bamboo tablet and wrote: *"Those seeking divination must arrive in the morning for guidance on fortune or misfortune. Only ten divinations are permitted each day; none after noon. Should the reading prove inaccurate, a penalty of ten taels and three mace of silver shall be paid!"* Having finished, he instructed Pengjian to sit at the crossroads of the main street, awaiting those who came to consult the oracle.

This spectacle caused a sensation among the people of Chaoge. Whispers spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, until the entire city buzzed with talk: *"How extraordinary! Never has a nobleman of such high standing abandoned his rank to take up divination as a trade. And for a tael of silver at that! Who knows if it’s even accurate?"* Some wished to test it, but the fee was too steep, and so they all stood by, hands tucked in their sleeves.

Zhou Gong remained there all day, impeccably dressed in full court attire, seated in the center of the divination stall. He required no attendants, only a censer of fine incense burning before him as he sat in quiet dignity. Pengjian, naturally, sat alone inside the entrance.

For two or three days, not a single person came to consult the oracle. Only crowds of idlers gathered, chattering endlessly. Among them, a local bully declared, *"This nobleman has a sense of humor—I’ll play along. I’ll part with one tael and three fen to test him."* Another, a soldier, said, *"Yesterday, I came into some wealth but forgot something important and can’t decide what to do. I’ll go have it divined!"* And so, the two entered one after the other.

Only because the Duke held a noble rank, who dared sit idly chatting with him? Without waiting to be told, the local bully handed over the one tael and three fen to Pengjian. Pengjian took the silver, chuckling inwardly, *"How amusing—today brings good fortune!"* He set the one tael before Zhou Gong’s seat and reported to him. Zhou Gong then instructed him to bring the first man in. The bully followed him inside.

Zhou Gong said, *"You need not bow, nor explain your matter. Simply stand to the side and pray silently."* The bully did as told, whispering his plea. After a moment, Zhou Gong said, *"I understand your heart. You desire the wife of one of your servants for her beauty. You wish to break them apart, forcing the husband to remarry, but he refuses. Now you intend to have him killed—is this not so? Yet I fear you will fail to kill him and instead bring death upon yourself!"*

Hearing his secret exposed, the bully was struck dumb, his face ashen. He fell to his knees, pleading, *"My lord! It is true. I beg you to show me the way—how may I avoid disaster?"* Zhou Gong nodded. *"Since you repent, there is still hope. Had you not met me, you would surely die tomorrow!"* He took up a sheet of paper, wrote several lines, and handed it to the bully. *"This concerns your heart’s desire—"*

The bully took it and read:

*Lusting to seize a youthful wife’s embrace,*
*Little did you know the trap was laid.*
*Tomorrow at the third watch, in your disgrace,*
*Two corpses shall lie in four parts displayed.*

Zhou Gong continued, *"The woman’s husband has already stolen from you and bribed men. Tomorrow, when she meets you, they will seize and kill you both. If you seek my salvation, you must renounce your desire for her, turn to virtue, and Heaven will protect you, turning misfortune to blessing. Here is your proof: tonight at the third watch, go east thirty li. You will see a lantern hanging at a door—knock and enter. There, you will meet your adversary. Invite him home for wine, and with mediation, all will be well by dawn."*

The bully kowtowed in gratitude, then rushed out. The crowd, seeing him drenched in sweat and fleeing, swarmed forward, blocking his path. *"Was the divination accurate?"* they demanded. Without stopping, he shoved them aside and declared, *"Truly, truly—it is most divine!"* Then he vanished in a flash.

The soldier had already approached the table. Following instructions, he too prayed silently. Zhou Gong rendered his judgment in a few lines and passed it to him. It read:

*Ten strings of cash you took in greed,*
*To catch adulterers in their deed.*
*Ill-gotten wealth—let it go,*
*Lest tangled passions bring you woe.*

Zhou Gong then called out, *"Soldier, yesterday someone gave you several dozen strings of cash, promising ten more if you helped catch adulterers at the third watch tomorrow—is this your concern?"* The soldier, trembling, prostrated himself. *"My lord, you are a living immortal!"*

The soldier replied, *"This humble one came precisely for this matter."* Zhou Gong smiled and said, *"Do not take this sum of money. If you help that man catch the adulterer and succeed, his resentment will be dispelled—why would he then give you the money? If you fail to catch the adulterer, how could he willingly part with his wealth? I will now show you a path: go meet that man as planned, and after you have met, present this divination slip of mine to them. Naturally, someone will give you ten strings of cash. From this day forward, abandon such reckless thoughts, and you will avoid disaster."*

The soldier, upon hearing this, hastily kowtowed and said, *"With my lord’s clear guidance, this humble one will never again entertain such improper desires!"* He then took his leave, refusing to disclose the matter to anyone, only exclaiming, *"Truly divine, a living immortal! If any of you doubt it, go and test it yourselves."* Hurriedly departing the divination market, he rushed away.

Unbeknownst to them, both the local tyrant and the soldier had come to believe in the divine accuracy of Master Zhou’s words. When they met, they discovered they had taken the same path: the one the soldier had been ordered to catch in the act was none other than the tyrant’s own servant. That night, their encounter left both astounded and overjoyed, fully convinced of Master Zhou’s oracular prowess. The tyrant invited everyone back to his home, where the soldier helped mediate between the two, producing Master Zhou’s divination slip for all to see. Only then was the knot of grievance untangled. The tyrant also gave the soldier ten strings of cash.

Word of these two cases spread through Zhaoge, and soon the entire city was abuzz. Those with unresolved disputes flocked to seek his judgments, crowding the divination market beyond capacity. Every ruling he issued proved accurate—each single verdict correct, every pair of rulings flawless. Day after day, he would settle exactly ten cases before closing his gate, paying no heed to those still waiting outside.

Peng Jian was overjoyed—earning three qian of silver daily, rain or shine. Childless and alone, he would rise each morning to resolve his ten cases. Once the sign was taken down and stored away, he would head straight to the taverns along the streets, determined to spend every last qian of his three. If any silver remained, he would give it to the poor who passed by. Months passed in this manner, and over half a year went by.

Yet even in such prosperity, a flaw lurked—trouble was about to unfold before his eyes.

Hear me now, good listeners, as I tell the tale in full.

In the city of Chaoge there lived a widow named Shi, whose husband had died years before. She had but one son, named Shi Zongfu, and though their household was poor, she had scraped together a few taels of silver. She sent her son to Mengjin to try his hand at trade, and as they parted, mother and son agreed he would return within three months. Yet half a year passed, and no word came. The widow Shi thought of her son day and night, standing at her gate in hope, only to watch the days slip by with no sign of him. She sought the counsel of gods and diviners, but all proved empty words, and her heart grew heavy with sorrow.

One day, as she stood at her door, she overheard passersby say: *"In Qiyun Lane, there is a Master Zhou who tells fortunes—his divinations are wondrously accurate. Only his fee is steep: one tael and three fen of silver!"* These words stirred her heart. *"Why not go and ask?"* she thought. She borrowed the sum from her neighbors, rose before dawn, washed and dressed, ate a light meal, bound her hair with black silk, locked her door, and set off for Master Zhou’s divination stall.

She arrived just as dawn broke. By chance, Peng Jian was opening his gate, hanging his sign, and sweeping the ground. The widow Shi recognized him and called out: *"Master Peng! Is the master in?"* Peng Jian looked up, saw that it was the widow Shi—once his neighbor in the same ward—and replied: *"Sister, you’ve come so early—you must have a matter at hand. Do you seek a divination?"* At his words, the widow Shi’s eyes brimmed with tears. *"Indeed."*

"My son, Shi Zongfu, left home to pursue trade abroad. Before departing, he promised to return within three months. Now half a year has passed, yet no word has come. I cannot set my heart at ease, so I borrowed one tael and three *fen* of silver to ask the master for a divination—whether he fares well, whether he lives or has perished. Then, at least, I may cease this endless fretting." As she spoke, she handed the silver to Peng Jian.

Peng Jian took it and said, "Rest assured, good sister! Heaven watches over the virtuous—your son is safe abroad. Perhaps he has merely been delayed. Since you, as his mother, cannot set your mind at ease without a divination, I shall take you inside." With that, he led the widow into the inner hall.

The widow Shi looked up and saw a table set in the center, upon which lay the Four Treasures of the Study, a divination tube, an incense altar, and the like. Seated in the middle was the master himself, his bearing unlike that of ordinary men—what an imposing presence! Behold:

A three-beamed crown adorned his head, its eight treasures clustered close; he wore a black silk robe, upon which coiled embroidered dragons. His face was dark as a cauldron’s bottom, yet gleamed; his eyes like stars, their pupils radiating light. Seated upright, he arrayed the Eight Trigrams before him—no less than a transcendent spirit in mortal guise.

At the sight of the Duke of Zhou’s majestic bearing, the widow Shi could not help but kneel at once. The Duke, seated above, saw an elderly woman enter—her face etched with sorrow, hurrying forward until she knelt in the center of the hall. His expression soured. Why? That very morning, upon taking his seat, he had cast a divination and found yin malevolence (*yin sha*) overwhelmingly strong. He had just been about to summon Peng Jian to instruct him: *No divination fees from women today.* Yet here, the first visitor brought before him was a woman. His displeasure showed as he said, "Rise."

Then he turned to Peng Jian: "Why did you not announce her before bringing someone in for divination?" Peng Jian replied, "This is the wife of Shi Du, Jia-shi. Her late husband and I were acquainted. Today, she comes to inquire about her son’s return—hence my failure to announce her first."

The widow Shi, hearing this, spoke through tears: "This old woman’s only son, Shi Zongfu, went abroad on business and has not returned for half a year. With no word of his life or death, my heart is consumed with worry. I know I have broken protocol and beg only for your mercy and compassion, Master!"

The Duke of Zhou nodded and said, "Very well. Are you asking about a traveler, then?"

"Let me divine a hexagram for you." He then took up the divination tube, shook it twice, and cast a hexagram. After calculating the branches—zi, wu, mao, and you—he sighed as he looked at the widow Shi: "If I did not speak plainly, would I not leave you vainly hoping? Your son’s life will end at the third watch tonight!"

Hearing this, the widow Shi started in shock and cried, "My lord! I asked when he would return—how can you say he is about to die?" The Duke of Zhou replied, "My divination aligns with the primordial yin and yang and the later heaven’s eight trigrams. Every detail, down to the finest hair, is revealed therein—how much more so the matter of your son’s life? Your son has indeed set out on his journey, but you and he may never meet again—even a ten-thousandth chance is impossible!"

The widow Shi burst into sobs: "If my son dies tonight, where will he die? What illness will claim him?" The Duke of Zhou answered, "I foresee your son crushed to death in a ruined kiln at the third watch tonight."

Seeing that the Duke’s words were as clear as if he had witnessed it himself, the widow’s heart grew even more desolate. She kowtowed repeatedly, begging the lord to save her son. The Duke of Zhou sighed, "Very well. Tell me your son’s Eight Characters and birth hour, and I will examine his annual fate."

The widow Shi hastily recited her son’s details—born on the eighteenth day of the twelfth month at the chou hour, now fourteen years old. The Duke of Zhou put away the divination box, arranged Shi Zongfu’s Eight Characters, and upon seeing them, cried out, "Alas! A baleful star looms over him, the White Tiger guards his fate—even an immortal could not pass through this gate! There is not a single saving grace in his destiny. What can be done?"

Stone Widow, compose your heart now and cease longing for him." Truly:
When King Yama decrees death at the third watch,
Who dares detain a soul till the fifth?

Seeing the Duke of Zhou declare her son beyond saving, the widow Shi could only wail aloud, her grief piercing as she left the divination market and made her way home. What fate befell her son? The answer lies in the next chapter.

Chapter Three: Soft Creature Born in Heaven’s Wrath | A Wise Maiden Perceives the Dao’s Mystery

We leave the widow Shi weeping her way home. Meanwhile, in the Tushita Palace of the Thirty-Third Heaven, the Most High Lord Lao sat in meditation upon his rush cushion when suddenly the Golden Youth came to report: "The boy who tends the divination box has vanished—gone no one knows where, and still he has not returned." Upon hearing this, Lord Lao extended his divine vision and soon understood the cause. He nodded and said, "Ah, wretched obstacle! Instead of nurturing stillness to cultivate the Dao and attain true fruition, you stir recklessly today, bringing suffering upon yourself."

"Not that I lack the compassion to save you!" With these words, he went to memorialize the August Heavenly Emperor. The Emperor then commanded the Peach Garden Immortal to descend to the mortal realm. The immortal, bearing the Jade Edict, followed a wisp of numinous light to the household of Minister Ren in the city of Zhaoge, for they shared a karmic bond. There, she was reborn as the minister’s daughter.

Now grown to sixteen, her face bloomed like peach blossoms, her frame swayed like tender willow—beyond compare in beauty. How so? A poem bears witness:

Her lips like cherries, teeth of jade,
She alone among mortals speaks the language of flowers.
Only by predestined bond was such a seed sown—
How rare for a celestial maiden to grace a mortal home!

When Minister Ren and his wife first beheld her, they dreamed of a sky ablaze with iridescent clouds, from which descended an immortal bearing a radiant peach blossom in hand. She placed it in the lady’s grasp, and with its fragrance still lingering, the dream dissolved. Three days later, the child was born, and so they named her Peach Blossom.

The elderly couple had no other daughter, cherishing her as a pearl cupped in their palms, raising her with every tenderness. But of this, no more need be said.

One day, as the couple sat together in their hall, they heard a clamor in the streets—wailing so mournful it chilled the heart. Minister Ren hurried out to see and recognized the widow Shi from next door. Tears streamed down her face as she sobbed uncontrollably, while the crowd around her offered words of comfort, though their murmurs were too tangled to make out. Perplexed, he stepped forward and called through the throng, “Good sister, what grieves you so? Come, take shelter in our home and share your sorrow. Perhaps this old man can offer some solace.”

With that, he ushered Widow Shi inside. The onlookers, seeing her led into the Ren residence, dispersed in a flurry. Minister Ren guided her through the main gate, where his wife came out to meet them. Seeing the widow’s distress, she rushed forward to support her, and together they entered the central hall and sat down. “Good sister,” Lady Ren asked gently, “who has wronged you? What quarrel has left you so aggrieved?”

Wiping her tears, the widow replied, “My lady, it is no quarrel—my son died at the third watch tonight. Who now will sustain this old life of mine?” At this, the couple gasped in shock. “Has word of misfortune reached you?” they asked.

The widow waved her hands frantically. “No, no. My boy left home saying he’d return within three months, but now half a year has passed with no news. Unable to bear the worry, I consulted the oracle this morning, and the hexagrams foretold great misfortune—tonight at the third watch, he would be crushed to death in an abandoned kiln. How could I not grieve?”

Minister Ren burst into laughter. “Good sister, I thought some calamity had befallen him! But this is only an ill-omened divination. Why torment yourself so? The fortune-teller is no living immortal—how could he know such things with certainty?”

The widow replied, “Had it been anyone else, I wouldn’t believe it. But this was divined by Lord Zhou. His judgments of yin and yang are infallible, his predictions of fortune and misfortune never err. What he says comes to pass. I pleaded with him, and he declared, *‘Unless you beg the King of Hell himself, I fear there is no hope of his survival.’*”

Minister Ren paused, taken aback. “I’ve heard Lord Zhou’s divinations are truly divine. If he says so, perhaps there is no saving your son. But sister, if he knows your boy will die in an abandoned kiln, why not ask him *which* kiln? Send someone at once to stop him from entering—then all may yet be well.”

Lady Ren interjected, “You’re growing old and forget how the world works! Lord Zhou is no living immortal—he merely interprets the hexagrams. How could he pinpoint *which* kiln? It seems there is no remedy after all.”

The stone-matron, hearing Lady Ren’s words, grew even more grieved and could no longer contain herself, bursting into loud sobs. Lord and Lady Ren, seeing her so distraught, reflected that she had but one son, and her household was poor and struggling—if he truly died, upon whom would these aged bones rely for care and compassion? At this thought, they too could not help but shed tears.

The narrative now turns elsewhere. As for Miss Peach Blossom, ever since the age of five, while playing outside with her maidservants, she had encountered a mendicant Daoist who gave her three volumes of celestial scripture and a pellet of elixir to consume. After eating it, she found herself able to recognize characters. Each night in her dreams, the Daoist would return to instruct her in their interpretation—truly teaching her for several months in her sleep, until at last she no longer dreamed of him. Having acquired immortal arts, she mastered the three volumes of celestial scripture within a year.

By the time she reached sixteen, she had still not told her parents, nor did she readily show herself to others. As Miss Peach Blossom had always loved peach blossoms, Lord Ren had planted several hundred peach trees in the rear garden for her to admire morning and evening. Each day, she tended to the peach trees in the garden or did some needlework. That morning, after finishing breakfast and putting away her sewing, she was about to go to the peach garden when she suddenly heard ceaseless wailing from the main hall, the voice sounding like that of a woman. She thought to herself, *“Why is someone weeping in the hall today? Let me go and see.”* With delicate steps, she made her way to the main hall.

There, she saw her parents sitting with the stone-matron from next door, all of them in tears. Startled, she approached and offered a deep bow. Seeing Miss Peach Blossom, the stone-matron suppressed her sorrow and said, *“Miss, how rare it is to see you appear before others! It’s been years since I last saw your countenance—now you’ve grown even more lovely.”* Lord and Lady Ren, seeing their daughter approach, wiped their tears and said, *“Daughter, come sit beside us.”*

Miss Peach Blossom then asked, *“Father, Mother, why are you weeping here with Auntie Stone?”* Lady Ren quickly replied, *“Daughter, you wouldn’t know. Auntie Stone’s son went away on business, and after half a year with no word, she went to Lord Zhou to divine when he might return. Unexpectedly, Lord Zhou, interpreting the hexagrams, declared that her son would surely die at the third watch tonight—with no hope of salvation. That’s why she is so heartbroken. Your father and I were trying to console her, but it stirred our own sorrow over having no son, and so we wept as well.”*

Miss Peach Blossom, upon hearing this, sighed and said, *"What great matter is this, to cause such distress? It’s only this!"* Turning to Auntie Stone, she continued, *"Do not grieve so, Auntie. If your brother is fated to die, no amount of weeping will bring him back to life. That Lord Zhou is not necessarily so divinely accurate in his calculations. Tell me your brother’s Eight Characters, and I’ll divine for you. Let me see whether his fate truly allows for salvation or not."*

Lord and Lady Ren, hearing this, immediately said, *"Daughter, do not tease Auntie. When have you ever learned to cast divinations?"* Miss Peach Blossom replied, *"Father and Mother, you do not know—I’ve only just learned. Auntie, go ahead and tell me. What harm is there in letting me try?"* With no other choice, Auntie Stone recited her son’s Eight Characters to Miss Peach Blossom.

Miss Peach Blossom extended her delicate fingers, counting and calculating for a moment. Soon, life and death, fortune and misfortune became perfectly clear to her. Nodding repeatedly, she said, *"What a remarkable Lord Zhou! His divination is entirely accurate—no wonder all of Chaoge City holds him in such reverence. Indeed, at the third watch tonight, your brother will surely be crushed to death beneath a ruined kiln. The White Tiger star dominates his fate, the Gate of Death guards his life, and both the yearly and monthly influences are inauspicious. There is no doubt he will die. Judging by the direction, it will be fifteen *li* south of the city, where a collapsed kiln stands. Tomorrow, his body will be found there."*

Auntie Stone, upon hearing this, began weeping again. Lord Ren quickly consoled her, laughing, *"Sister, do not take the words of a child so seriously. If we know the direction, I’ll send a servant at once to save your son. Why distress yourself so? But my daughter’s words cannot be trusted."* Miss Peach Blossom smiled and said, *"Can human effort defy Heaven? If you and Auntie cannot believe me, so be it. But the hour has just entered *wei*, and by the beginning of *shen*, a great storm will arrive. If there is no wind or rain, then my words are empty nonsense. If the storm comes, Auntie, hurry back, and I will teach you a method to save him."*

With that, she bid them farewell and returned straight to the peach garden. Lord Ren, hearing his daughter’s words, could not help but laugh heartily. *"Wife,"* he said, *"look at this clear sky—where is the rain? Sister, do not grieve so. Even if your son were to die, weeping would not bring him back. In my opinion, return home and put your mind at ease. Tomorrow, I’ll send someone to inquire after him."*

With no other recourse, Auntie Stone took her leave and returned home, lost in anxious thoughts. As the *shen* hour arrived, the weather suddenly changed: in an instant, a fierce storm erupted, with torrential rain and howling winds. Auntie Stone, seeing the heavens unleash such a tempest, was startled. *"Indeed, the rain has come! This proves Miss Peach Blossom’s divination is accurate. She said there was a way to save my son—why not go and beg her for it? Perhaps she truly has a method to rescue my child."*

Braving the downpour, she hurried to Squire Ren’s gate and knocked to be let in. At that moment, Squire Ren and his wife were in the main hall, marveling at their daughter’s divination—how uncannily accurate it had proven—and wondering how she had acquired such mystical arts. As they spoke, they saw Auntie Stone arrive through the rain and immediately understood she had come on account of her son. How she might secure his rescue would be revealed in the next chapter.

**Chapter Four**
*Auntie Stone Pleads for Her Orphaned Son*
*Miss Peach Blossom Teaches a Strange Art*

Auntie Stone entered the central hall, where Squire Ren and his wife rose to greet her, and they all took their seats. Serving girls attended to her needs. Without delay, Auntie Stone adjusted her robes, dropped to her knees in haste, and implored, *"Master, Mistress, you must save my son! My gratitude will know no bounds!"*

Squire Ren and his wife quickly helped her to her feet, saying, *"Old sister, have you seen the rain outside? This was merely our daughter’s idle guess—please, rise."* Once she stood, Auntie Stone pressed on: *"Master, Mistress, if your daughter’s words were mere nonsense, how could they have come to pass so precisely? I beg you both to summon her at once. Any further delay, and I fear it will be too late to save him."* With that, tears streamed down her face.

Unable to refuse, Squire Ren called for a servant girl to fetch Miss Peach Blossom. The moment Auntie Stone saw her, she cried, *"Miss, have mercy! Save my son’s life!"* and knelt once more. Mistress Ren stepped forward to lift her up, saying, *"How can this be?"* Then, turning to her daughter, she urged, *"Child, if there is any way you can save him, do so."*

Miss Peach Blossom motioned for her parents and Auntie Stone to sit, then said, *"There is indeed a method to save him, but you must never reveal my name to anyone. You must not say I saved your son—if Duke Zhou learns of it, he will never let the matter rest. He will come for me, and our families will become entangled in bitter enmity. Would that not turn your kindness into vengeance?"*

Auntie Stone replied, *"Miss, rest assured! How could I be so ungrateful? I would never breathe a word of your name."*

Peach Blossom said, *"Since that is so, Auntie, listen to what I say: according to the divination of the Eight Trigrams, your son is fated to die without hope of life. Yet I possess a kind of immortal art that can revive the dead and reverse his fate by breaking the Eight Trigrams. If you do not trust in this spiritual power, there will be no way to save him!"*

Auntie Stone, overjoyed upon hearing this, said, *"Miss, how do you perform this method? Tell me quickly so I may act at once!"*

Peach Blossom replied, *"There is no need for anything else. You must go and purchase a paper horse for the Star Lord of the Local Earth God and another for the Fire Virtue Foundation Lord. Place them in the room as offerings, with two candles lit beside them. You need only set out a bowl of pure water and an egg beneath the table. Then, invert a sieve and place a lamp beneath it—this is called the 'Lamp of Added Lifespan,' and you must never blow it out. If it goes out, your son will be beyond saving. Observe whether the wind and rain continue or cease tonight. If they cease and the sky clears as before, at that time, find an old shoe and an old garment with a lining. Place a mirror atop them and set them in the bowl of water. You must then take the old shoe in hand and sit in the room. Be sure to step outside the main gate, strike the threshold with the shoe, and call your son’s name once before returning. Do this once for every watch of the night. If you call past the third watch, you may rest easy and go to sleep. Tomorrow morning, I assure you, your son will return home, and mother and child will be reunited."*

Just so:

The maiden’s wondrous method none could know,
Yet from primordial Heaven’s secret scrolls it came.

That day, Old Woman Shi carefully took her leave of Squire Ren and his wife and hurried home. The storm still raged, and though the couple had heard their daughter describe countless techniques, they remained unconvinced. Together they asked, “Dear child, life and death are decreed by Heaven above. If Shi Zongfu is fated to perish tonight at the third watch in the ruined kiln south of the city, how can you have his mother weep through half the night and promise his return by dawn, reuniting mother and son? We find these words hard to believe.”

Seeing her parents’ doubt, the young lady dared not reveal the truth beforehand, lest she leak Heaven’s design. She merely replied, “It is not yet time to explain. Wait until tomorrow, and I will tell you both.” Satisfied with this answer, the elder Rens pressed no further. The young lady took leave of her parents and retired to the Peach Garden to rest.

As for Shi Zongfu—when he left home in the ninth month of the previous year, he had promised to return within three months. Yet on the road he met a cloth merchant and joined him in a venture to Mengjin. The journey proved so profitable that he lost track of time. With two ledgers of capital, he had earned threefold in interest. By the end of the second month, he longed to return, knowing his mother awaited him. He bid his companion farewell, packed his belongings, and set off posthaste for Chaoge. Along the way, he ate when hungry, drank when thirsty, traveled by moonlight and starlight, and wished he could fly home in a single step to embrace his mother. After several days of travel, on the fifteenth day of the third month, Shi Zongfu left his inn. Calculating the distance, he found himself no more than a hundred and fifty or sixty li from Chaoge. “If I push on today,” he thought, “I can reach the city.” With this in mind, he quickened his pace, head bowed in thought, striding swiftly forward without a glance at the passing scenery.

Just as he reached the hour of *shen*, dark clouds suddenly gathered on all sides. Shi Zongfu groaned inwardly, "The rain is coming—how can I possibly cover these last few dozen *li* and reach the city in time?" His thoughts grew tangled, his anxiety mounting with each step, yet his pace slowed all the same. After hurrying several *li*, sweat drenched his body. A fierce wind lashed his face, and in an instant, the downpour struck like lightning, pouring down in torrents. Shi Zongfu knew there were no villages ahead nor dwellings behind—nowhere to take shelter. Though he had rain gear, the gale and deluge rendered it useless, leaving him no choice but to press onward through the storm. Each step became a struggle. As he walked, he scanned his surroundings, desperate for some refuge to weather the rain, if only for a moment.

Ahead, he spotted a crumbling kiln. Though dilapidated, it would suffice for shelter. He set down his belongings, peeled off his sodden clothes, wrung them out, and—finding nowhere to hang them—draped them back over his body. Sinking to the ground, he sighed repeatedly: *"How infuriating! The more I rush, the more fate thwarts me. Truly, the heavens rain without regard for man."* Glancing at the darkening sky, the rain still unrelenting, he realized he would not reach the city that day. With no other recourse, he resigned himself to spending the night in the ruined kiln, alone and forlorn, waiting for dawn to make his way into the city.

He consoled himself: *"Must I absolutely enter the city today? After all these days endured, can I not bear one more night?"* Turning the thought over, his mind gradually settled. Leaning against the wall, he closed his eyes to rest. *(The rest is left untold.)*

Meanwhile, the Stone Crone, half-believing and half-doubting Peach Blossom Girl’s words, braved the rain to purchase two paper horses bearing the Star Lords’ insignia and returned home. A live chicken was at hand, and she took one. As dusk deepened, the rain gradually cleared, and her heart settled somewhat. Seeing Peach Blossom Girl’s words prove true, she thought, *"Surely my child has hope now!"* Another moment passed, and the sky indeed brightened—startled, she murmured in awe, *"Peach Blossom is truly a divine being! She must not be underestimated."*

Judging the hour ripe for mourning her son, she covered her face and began to wail, her grief mounting until she wept and cried out in earnest. Only at the first watch did she fall silent. Then, taking Shi Zongfu’s shoe, she stepped outside the main gate and struck it once in the center of the threshold. With each blow, she called out, *"Shi Zongfu, my child! Come back quickly—I long for you so! When parents live, a son should not wander far, lest I stand at the gate in vain. I beg you!"*

That day, the author of this tale composed a song to share with you all. Its lyrics read:

At the first watch, the moon hangs low,
In the widow’s chamber, sobs overflow.
She cries, she calls for her son, Shi Zongfu:
*"Oh, my child! My heart’s own marrow!
Where are you now?
I sent you off to trade, yet parted from this wretched mother so.
Here I count the days, my fingers worn with longing,
Never dreaming you’d vanish past the year’s last moon’s fading glow.
Now it’s the third day of the third month—
Oh, my child, how my heart burns with woe!"*

At the second watch, the moon climbs high,
In the widow’s chamber, her wails rise to the sky.
She calls for her son, Shi Zongfu:
*"Why did your fate turn so cruel?
Any death but this—
Never should you have perished in some ruined kiln so cold!
What sin did you commit?
Condemned to wander far, your homeland left behind.
Since Master Zhou foretold your doom, my heart has been carved by a thousand blades.
If you falter now, your mother—half a soul—will be left with no end in sight!"*

At the third watch, the moon stands at its peak,
In the widow’s chamber, her sorrow runs deep.
She calls for her son, Shi Zongfu:
*"What misfortune did you invite?
Now I’ve followed Miss Ren’s method—
But will this way truly work? I cannot know!
If your life is spared and you return,
I’ll burn silver candles high to thank the gods’ grace!"*

Old Woman Shi, heeding Peach Blossom Girl’s instructions, wept for a while, then called out a line. She wailed until the fourth watch before falling silent, ceasing her cries. She returned to the inner hall, preparing to rest her head upon the pillow—yet for now, let us set this aside.

Meanwhile, Shi Zongfu, alone in the ruined kiln, saw the rain gradually clear at the first watch. With nothing to occupy him in the desolate shelter, he hastened his journey. From the fifth watch until the hour of *shen*, the rain poured heavily again. Leaning against the kiln’s crumbling wall, he shut his eyes in exhaustion. Soon, he drifted into a deep slumber, his snores like thunder. That night, the perilous wall teetered on collapse—what would become of his life? We shall see in the next chapter.

**Book Two**

**Chapter Five**
*The Filial Son Escapes Disaster Through Divine Dispensation*
*The Compassionate Mother Reunites with Her Son Through Wondrous Art*

*Poem:*
White clouds still drift o’er autumn’s Han palace halls,
Beacon fires fade, their smoke on lofty towers palls.
Where now the general’s steed and war-worn might?
Wild grasses, idle blooms—all earth is steeped in sorrow’s blight.

Now, Shi Zongfu, still in the ruined kiln, had nearly reached the end of the first watch. Leaning against the wall, his eyes heavy with weariness, he was just about to drift asleep when suddenly he heard someone outside call out: “Shi Zongfu, my child! Come back at once!” Startled, he opened his eyes wide—only to find himself alone in the broken kiln. He listened again, but the voice was gone. Muttering to himself, he thought: *How strange! Just now, someone clearly called my name. Could my mind be addled, and I misheard?*

By then, the rain had ceased. He stepped outside and looked up to see a sky full of bright stars, a slender crescent moon casting faint light, the grass slick as oil. Though he wished to press onward, he knew the road ahead offered no shelter. Reluctantly, he returned to the kiln and sat where he had before, his heart full of doubt: *Could this be my imagination playing tricks? Perhaps my longing for my mother is so intense that my soul, borne on the wind, has conjured this voice by chance. But how could my mother’s call reach me from so far away?*

Lost in thought, he drifted back into a hazy slumber. In his dream, he heard the voice again. “How bizarre!” he thought. “Could I be mistaken once more?” He bolted upright, crying out, “Mother!” Tears streamed down his face. After a moment’s bewilderment, he gave a bitter laugh: *Of course—I must be muddled! If I hadn’t heard my mother’s call in a dream, how could I have ventured into these wilds by night? But here I am, utterly alone. Who knows the hardship of my solitary refuge? Mother… you cannot know your son now lingers in this desolate place.*

That night, his restless thoughts stirred up demonic delusions, leaving his heart even more agitated. "I cannot sleep in peace," he muttered, "and my heart aches for my mother. Why not sit until the fifth watch? When dawn breaks, I can enter the city and see if anyone has truly called for me again." Resolved, he roused his spirits and sat upright for a while, the faint moonlight still lingering.

Just as he sat through the third watch, his eyes grew heavy once more. Then, clear and unmistakable, he heard a voice at his ear: *"Shi Zongfu, my child! Come back at once!"* Overcome, he burst into sobs and cried out, *"Mother! Your son is here!"* *This is surely my mother’s voice—could she truly have come near these outskirts?* With that thought, he rushed outside to search.

No sooner had he stepped beyond the cave’s entrance than a deafening crash erupted behind him, as though heaven and earth were collapsing.

The sight sent Shi Zongfu’s soul scattering beyond the heavens. He whipped around to look—only to see the crumbling cave dwelling collapse in upon itself. With a cry of *"Aiya!"*, his body gave way, and he slumped to the ground. After steadying his spirit for some time, he at last sighed deeply and murmured, *"This old cave, worn by years of wind and rain, must have been soaked through by this downpour. How could its walls have held?"* Truly, it was fated in a past life that Shi Zongfu should have been crushed to death in that ruined shelter tonight—yet by some twist, Peach Blossom Girl had taught Shi’s widowed mother a way to avert the disaster, allowing him to escape this calamity. Though Peach Blossom Girl’s Dao arts reached the divine, it was also by virtue of Shi Zongfu’s filial piety that this karmic cause and effect came to pass.

That night, as Shi Zongfu gathered his wits, he intoned, *"Great Compassionate Savior, Most High Heavenly Worthy!"* Then, struck by the thought, he broke into sobs once more: *"Had I been but a step slower, I would have been buried alive inside! Who knows how many years it would have taken to drag my corpse from the rubble?"*

"How could my mother at home have known? She would have waited in vain for my death—would that not have cost one life and doomed another? And who would have cared for her in her old age?" As he spoke through his sobs, a gust of wind suddenly rushed past, and the watchman’s drum on the city wall struck the fourth watch. Shi Zongfu started, then laughed aloud: "Fool that I am! Heaven has favored me, sparing me from this great calamity—what greater fortune could there be? Tomorrow morning, I will enter the city and see my mother. Then mother and son will talk and laugh together—is that not a joyous thing?" His sorrow turned to joy, and he sat down upon a roadside stone. After a while, the muffled clang of the fifth watch’s gong drifted from the city, filling him with delight. "One more watch," he thought, "and dawn will break. But my belongings are buried in the ruins, and I cannot dig them out now. Fortunately, I have twenty taels of silver on me. Staying here by this ruined shelter is useless—better to hurry to the city gates and wait. When dawn comes and the gates open, I can enter and see my mother." With that, he rose at once, straightened his clothes, and strode swiftly toward Chaoge City, arriving with nothing but his life and empty hands.

Shi Zongfu hastened to the city gate and stood alone, waiting. Soon, the sky brightened, and the gates swung open. He stepped inside and hurried home, his feet moving as swiftly as wings. As he raised his hand to knock, a voice answered from within. Though Shi’s mother had lain down that night, she could not sleep. Fearful that the words of the Duke of Zhou might prove true and Peach Blossom Girl’s false, she tossed and turned until the last watch, when she finally dozed off. Suddenly, the sound of knocking startled her awake. She answered at once, her heart leaping with joy—she knew her son had returned alive. She scrambled up, rushed to the door, and cried out, "My son Shi Zongfu! Have you come home?"

"Your mother has longed for you so desperately!" She hurriedly unlatched the door. Where was this a mere mother and son reunion? It was as if they had been reborn and met again—boundless joy, yet endless sorrow.

Without a word of other matters, Old Woman Shi rushed forward, wrapped her son in her arms, and wept aloud, "My child! Have you truly returned alive?" Seeing his mother speak so strangely, Shi Zongfu could not help but shed tears as well. "Mother, I truly escaped death and returned. Let us go inside, and I will tell you everything slowly." Hearing this, Old Woman Shi pulled her son by the hand, and together they entered the main hall and sat down.

Shi Zongfu then recounted how he had taken shelter from the rain on the road, hidden in the ruined kiln until a certain hour, and how "I heard you call for me three times. When I rushed out of the kiln, it collapsed and nearly crushed me inside. Now all my luggage is buried in the kiln, though fortunately, I had the silver on me." As he spoke, he broke into sobs. Upon hearing this, Old Woman Shi could not help but weep as well. After the two had cried together for some time, she said, "Let us not grieve any longer. The one who saved your life lives right next door. Quickly, come with me to thank Miss Ren!"

Shi Zongfu asked in haste, "Mother, whom are we going to thank for saving my life?" Old Woman Shi then told him how, "Fearing you would not return, I went to Master Zhou to divine your fate. He said that last night at the third watch, you would be crushed to death in the ruined kiln, with no way to escape. I wept bitterly on my way home, but the daughter of our neighbor, Old Man Ren, taught me a way to break the curse—just as I have done—and so saved your life." She pointed to the table, "See the paper horses there? And the eggs, the sieve, the lamp, the robe, the mirror, and the shoes?" Only then, hearing his mother’s words and recalling what had happened in the kiln, did Shi Zongfu realize the truth. "Mother, what you say is entirely correct. It was truly Miss Ren who saved my life. But how can we simply go to her home like this? Wouldn’t others gossip about it?"

"Now your son has twenty taels of silver on him. Take out two or three taels to buy a sheep and a jar of wine to send over—only then will it show our wholehearted gratitude." Upon hearing her son’s words, Old Woman Shi suddenly thought, "If my son wants to buy sheep and wine, it would indeed be a token of filial piety, but there’s no need to spend our own silver. When Master Zhou cast that divination, he charged one tael and three *fen*. If his prediction proved false, he would repay tenfold. Why not go ask Master Zhou for the silver first, then buy the sheep and wine with it? Wouldn’t that be better? But Miss Ren told me explicitly never to mention her name. If we go to Master Zhou for the silver and he asks how you returned, what should we say in reply?" Shi Zongfu said, "Mother, set your mind at ease. Just say I made it back on my own. How would he know it was the Ren family who saved me?"

Mother and son settled on their plan, then took their morning meal. Locking the door behind them, they made their way together to the divination market. By then, Master Zhou had already cast ten divinations, and only Peng Jian remained at the entrance, putting away the signboard. Old Woman Shi called out to him. Peng Jian turned his head, saw her, and said, “Old Sister, what brings you here again?” Before the words were fully out, he suddenly caught sight of Shi Zongfu standing beside his mother and started in alarm: “My good brother! Are you man or ghost? What day is it that you’ve returned—whose life are you after?” Shi Zongfu feigned ignorance and forced a smile: “How has Master Peng been? We parted only half a year ago, and now you jest with me. Please go inside and tell him: we’d like the fee for those two divinations from yesterday.” Hearing this, Peng Jian understood at once. Stepping closer with a grin, he said, “Good brother, you’re back. Were you safe and sound last night at the third watch? Since my master’s divination proved false, you and your mother have come to demand repayment.” Old Woman Shi, being of an age to know better, quickly interjected, “Master Peng, we’re poor folk—how dare we ask Master Zhou for repayment? We only beg that he return the fee for yesterday’s divination. I borrowed it from someone else, and if I can repay them, we’ll be deeply indebted to Master Zhou’s great kindness!” How Shi Zongfu managed to reclaim the divination fee will be revealed in the next chapter.

**Chapter Six**
*Mother and Son Repay a Debt of Gratitude; Diviner and Servant Ponder the Art of Augury*

A poem reads:
A master’s skill meets a hand that overturns the sky,
In contests of wit, the unexpected may yet lie.
Think not your move the first to strike—
Beware the foe who claims the lead.

Upon hearing Old Woman Shi’s words, Peng Jian knew full well the “fine speech” she and her son had concocted to demand repayment. With a cold laugh, he said, “How amusing! How very amusing! My master can’t very well argue today!” Still chuckling, he stepped inside and called out, “Quickly, return the divination fee to them!”

“I did warn you to examine the divination carefully—you claimed it was ‘never wrong in a hundred cases,’ yet today this very matter has come to pass!” At this, Master Zhou, still seated, rounded on Peng Jian: “Are you mad? What nonsense are you spouting?” Peng Jian grinned. “Nonsense? They’re here to demand tenfold repayment!” Master Zhou flared up. “Rubbish! Who dares demand repayment from me?” Peng Jian replied, “No need for anger, sir. The ones demanding repayment are right outside the door.” Without waiting for further orders, he went out and ushered in Shi Zongfu and his mother.

Master Zhou saw clearly from his seat: it was indeed the widow Shi, with a sturdy fellow standing beside her—her son, no doubt. His heart lurched. “Yesterday I divined that her son would be crushed to death in a ruined kiln at the third watch. How has he returned alive? Their demand for repayment is a minor matter—what troubles me is that my yin-yang calculations were flawless. How could they fail to manifest? There must be some hidden cause.” He addressed the widow from his seat: “Who is this beside you, and what brings you here?” Old Woman Shi answered, “Master, this is my son, Shi Zongfu. He did not die last night and only returned home this morning. I’ve brought him here to kowtow to you.” Quick-witted, Shi Zongfu heard his mother’s words, promptly knelt, and kowtowed once before rising to stand at her side.

That single bow turned Master Zhou’s swarthy face crimson. Shame and embarrassment mingled as he pushed the divination silver across the table. “Widow Shi, I won’t take advantage of your poverty—take it!” Shi Zongfu stepped forward and gathered up the ten packets of silver. Master Zhou pressed further: “Shi Zongfu, did you spend last night in the ruined kiln south of the city? Who taught you the art that allowed you to break the spell and save your life? Tell me the truth, and I’ll reward you handsomely!” Hearing this interrogation, Shi Zongfu replied, “Last night I was hurrying home and couldn’t reach an inn in time, so I did indeed spend the night in the ruined kiln. Around midnight, my stomach suddenly ached, and I needed to relieve myself. I’d just stepped outside the kiln when it collapsed—so I wasn’t crushed inside.” Master Zhou countered, “Impossible. Yesterday I divined that a heavy rain would fall from the hour of the monkey until the hour of the rooster, clearing only at the third watch. I also divined that you would die alone in the kiln, with no savior. How could you have gone out to defecate? I don’t believe a word of it!”

“‘Master Peng,’ scoffed Peng Jian upon seeing Lord Zhou reimburse Granny Shi, ‘your divination was supposed to be infallible—yet now you’ve suffered a loss! Shi Zongfu truly had a stomachache, and it was a belly full of excrement that saved his life. The silver has already been given to him—let him and his mother go. Why keep pressing him?’ Lord Zhou, stung by these words, hung his head in shame and said nothing. Granny Shi, sensing the shift, promptly took her leave. Peng Jian followed her out. Zongfu then asked, ‘The signboard promised ten taels and three mace—why only ten?’ Hearing this, Peng Jian stamped his foot and said, ‘I’ll make up the three mace myself—wait here while I fetch it.’ Granny Shi quickly interjected, ‘My lord, don’t trouble yourself over such trifles with a child. We’re grateful just to recover our principal. You’ve already compensated tenfold—more than enough. How could we accept further repayment from you?’”

“At the time, Peng Jian found these words hard to bear. Slowly, he said, ‘Good brother, though you spoke without thinking, what you said makes perfect sense. If His Lordship has already compensated, how could I not do the same?’ With that, he reached into his robe and took out ten small packets, handing them to Shi Zongfu. Zongfu, shameless as ever, accepted them. After his mother added a few polite words, the two left in high spirits. Peng Jian stood dumbstruck for a while, then turned and stormed into the inner hall, too furious to speak.

Lord Zhou, already displeased by Peng Jian’s earlier teasing, saw him enter in such a state. He wanted to scold him, but then thought, ‘If I reprimand him now, won’t people laugh and say, “He couldn’t even read his own divination, so he takes it out on others?”’ Swallowing his anger, he said, ‘Peng Jian, go take down the signboard at the gate. From now on, I will no longer sell divinations.’

Seeing Lord Zhou’s anger, Peng Jian dared not disobey. He took down the signboard and returned to store it away. Truly:

*No matter how much water you draw from the Three Rivers,
It cannot wash away today’s shame.*”

At that time, the Shi family mother and son, having received thirteen taels of silver, were overjoyed. They purchased a sheep and wine from the market stalls along the way and returned home. After changing into new clothes, they went together to the Ren household to kowtow and express their gratitude to Elder Ren and his wife. Seeing the weight of their gifts, Elder Ren repeatedly declined, but the Shi mother and son would not hear of it. With no other choice, the elder accepted. He then instructed his servants to prepare a feast to welcome them. After drinking for half a day, they finally took their leave. As they departed, Elder Ren and his wife again and again urged them never to reveal that it was his daughter who had devised the plan to save them.

This matter shall be set aside for now.

As for Lord Zhou, ever since the day the Shi family mother and son had come to reclaim the divination fee, he had been deeply displeased. He shut down his divination stall for several days in a row, refusing to read fortunes for anyone, and instead sat sullenly in his study. He thought to himself, *"My Eight Trigrams are precise, my judgments infallible—how could my divination of Shi Zongfu’s death have been so wrong?"* He pondered further: *"Yet the previous divinations I cast were all accurate."* His heart grew ever more perplexed.

Suddenly, he jolted awake with a start and laughed at himself, saying, *"How foolish I am! Why not cast another divination to see? Then I would know. Why waste time in wild speculation?"* Hurriedly, he took up his divination tube, shook it several times, and cast a hexagram. Upon careful examination, he found it to be *"pure yin holding the position of the self."* His heart leapt in alarm: *"That day when I divined for myself, it was also inauspicious for yin persons—today I cast another hexagram of pure yin! Could some yin person be disrupting my Eight Trigrams?"* He pondered it from every angle, and all signs pointed to this conclusion. Yet try as he might, he could not divine the name of this yin person, and his frustration grew.

*(The narrator adds: Since Peach Blossom Girl had already transmitted her method to Old Woman Shi, her own Eight Characters had long been concealed. How could Lord Zhou possibly deduce Peach Blossom Girl’s name? Thus, no matter how he calculated—palm-reading, reckoning, reckoning, palm-reading—he could discern nothing. Secretly, he seethed: "Once I uncover this person’s name, I swear I will not rest until I have cut them in two!")* In a fit of rage, he flung aside the divination box. After stewing in his anger for some time, with no recourse and no solution, he could only relent.

From that day forward, he sat in gloom all day, nearly forsaking even food and drink. Those around him knew Lord Zhou’s temper well and dared not offer comfort. In the blink of an eye, it was already the first ten days of the seventh month. That day, Lord Zhou sat alone in the flower pavilion.

Peng Jian entered to find Lord Zhou sunk in gloom. Knowing it was over the matter of Shi Zongfu, he burst into laughter and said, "My lord, if Shi Zongfu had never emerged from that ruined kiln, would he not have been crushed to death inside? Perhaps he did some good deed along the way. As the old saying goes, 'A single act of hidden merit may add ten years to one’s lifespan.' It may well be that he encountered some noble soul who secretly came to his aid. Why not divine for yourself to see if this is so?"

Lord Zhou replied, "When have I not divined for myself? The hexagram clearly shows a yin person who rescued him from disaster, breaking my divination. But no matter how I calculate, I cannot deduce that person’s name!"

Peng Jian continued, "In this city of Zhaoge, let alone a yin person—even the most towering of men could hardly disrupt my lord’s divine eight trigrams. Moreover, your calculations have always been infallible, step after step. Even if this one hexagram proves inaccurate, what harm is there? The diviners at the gate have been waiting day after day, their mouths parched from speaking, yet they refuse to leave, pleading endlessly. Some have even come from afar, and if they depart without a divination, they leave in bitter resentment. I deeply regret this. My lord’s divinations were meant to guide the lost. If you abandon this purpose over such a trifle, will you not be ridiculed? What is to be done?"

Lord Zhou pondered his words and said, "What you say is reasonable, but I still wish to uncover the name of the one who rescued Shi Zongfu. Yet no matter how I calculate, the eight trigrams seem unreliable. Let me first divine a hexagram or two for myself to test their accuracy before reopening the divination market. One cannot be too careful!"

Peng Jian smiled and said, "My lord, instead of divining for yourself, why not divine for me? Let us see what fortune or misfortune awaits me in the coming months."

Lord Zhou gave a cold laugh. "Peng Jian, you have served me faithfully for many years, honest and diligent in all things. Today, I shall grant you a divination." He instructed Peng Jian to light incense before the ancient sages and fetch the divination box. Peng Jian, overjoyed, quickly lit a stick of incense and handed over the box. Lord Zhou shook the oracle tube six times in succession, scrutinizing the hexagram within. Suddenly, his expression changed—his tongue flicked, his head shook. Had he not divined that day, all might have been well. But this single hexagram turned Lord Zhou’s dark face sallow, his thick brows knitting with two strands of purple qi.

Truly, no one yet knew what fortune or misfortune this hexagram foretold for Peng Jian, or what omens it bore. But that shall be revealed in the next chapter.

**Chapter Seven: A Trial Divination Reveals Ominous News; A Special Plea Unlocks New Hope**

*Poem:*
Who would have thought Lord Zhou’s trigrams so keen,
Yet Peach Blossom’s art outshines the seer’s sheen.
Even the strong meet stronger hands unseen—
A guide through mist saves old Peng’s doom serene.

Had Lord Zhou not divined for Peng Jian, all might have been well. But once the hexagram was cast, he stood dumbstruck, his complexion shifting. After a long silence, he fixed his gaze on Peng Jian, nodding repeatedly with a sigh of sorrow.

Peng Jian, seeing Lord Zhou’s grim expression after the divination, grew alarmed. "My lord," he asked, "does this hexagram foretell more misfortune than fortune? Why not explain it so I may take precautions?"

Lord Zhou let out a long sigh. "I have never hidden the truth in my divinations; I always speak plainly. Since I have divined for you, how could I not reveal it? This hexagram not only bears ill omens but also foretells that your very life cannot be preserved. This is your destined end—within three days, on the afternoon of the third night, at precisely the fifth quarter of the *chou* hour, you will depart this world. You will first suffer a headache, then vomit blood and die. Alas, you have served me faithfully for so many years, honest and steadfast in all things. Yet today, I stand by helpless, unable to save you!" As he spoke, tears welled in his eyes.

Ah! Even ants cling to life. Upon hearing Lord Zhou’s words, Peng Jian was so terrified his soul fled to the heavens, his spirit scattered to the nine skies. With a cry of "Ai-yo!" he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly. After a long while, he sobbed, "My lord! Is this hexagram truly accurate?"

Lord Zhou replied, "Would I deceive you?"

"You have served me all your life without fault, yet I have never done you any great kindness. Now I give you ten taels of silver—while your destined hour has not yet come, go and enjoy a few cups of wine with gladness! As for all your funeral arrangements, I shall see to them myself. Set your heart at ease and trouble yourself no more about such matters!" With that, he ordered someone to fetch ten taels of silver and handed them to Peng Jian.

But Peng Jian had long known that Lord Zhou’s divine hexagrams were never wrong. Seeing him thus today, he knew the prediction was true. Dropping to his knees, he pleaded, "My lord! Since the hexagram foretells such great misfortune, why not save me?"

Lord Zhou replied, "Life and death are governed by fate—how could I save you? Take the silver and go outside to ease your troubled heart!"

Peng Jian knew well Lord Zhou’s unyielding nature; he understood that further pleas would be futile. Accepting the silver, he left with a heavy heart, head bowed, and tucked the money into his sash. He made his way to a grand tavern, chose a fine seat, and called for the waiter to pour two measures of fine wine and bring several choice dishes. Alone, he poured and drank, lost in thought: *"Today I am still a man, but in three days I will be a ghost. What a wretched fate!"* As the thought weighed on him, tears welled in his eyes.

The tavern staff, who knew Peng Jian well, saw his sorrow and asked, "Master Peng, it’s been ages since you came for a drink. Why the tears today? Has Lord Zhou closed his divination stall, leaving you short of coin?"

Peng Jian replied, "No, it’s not that—I have other troubles on my mind." He drank on in gloom, cup after cup. As the saying goes, *wine enters a sorrowful heart and quickly intoxicates*. Before he had finished the two measures, Peng Jian was thoroughly drunk. Settling his bill, he staggered home, lurching this way and that. Once inside his room, he collapsed fully clothed onto his bed and fell into a deep, snoring sleep that lasted the night.

The next morning, he awoke and immediately thought of his impending doom. Tears streamed down his face as he rose slowly and sat in a chair, muttering to himself, *"Lord Zhou’s divine hexagrams are never wrong, not by the slightest degree. But if a man’s death is fated, how can he escape it? I might as well seek some last pleasures! If only he had told me sooner—I could have had a few more days of joy."* He changed his clothes, left his quarters without reporting to the inner chambers, locked his door, and set off for the streets again.

The servants at the gate had noticed his listless demeanor over the past two days—his comings and goings always with head bowed, silent. They whispered among themselves, unsure of the cause, but dared not ask.

Once outside, Peng Jian headed for another tavern, musing as he walked: *"When Lord Zhou foretold Stone Zongfu’s death, he did not die. Now he says I will die—will I truly die? Or is it a false death? Perhaps even if it’s real, I could feign death like Stone Zongfu."* Then he recalled, *"He said Stone would die in a ruined kiln—if he hadn’t gone out to relieve himself and run outside, he would have been crushed by falling tiles. Since he was crushed, he could escape and live. But I am to die vomiting blood—how can I avoid that?"* Overcome, he wept as he walked.

Lost in grief, he suddenly felt a slap on his shoulder. Startled, he thought the messenger of death had come. *"So soon?"* he cried. Turning, he saw it was a man—upon steadying himself, he recognized Stone Zongfu.

Stone Zongfu had been walking behind and noticed Peng Jian sighing to himself, now looking down, now gazing at the sky, deep in troubled thought. He caught up and tapped his shoulder. "Master Peng, what are you pondering? Why such a gloomy air?" Seeing the tears streaming down his face, he asked, "What on earth is the matter?"

Peng Jian, wiping his tears, replied, "It’s a long story, my good brother. Where are you headed?"

"Home," said Stone.

"Good, we’re going the same way." The two walked together, chatting and laughing along the way.

Then, as if by heaven’s design, Peng Jian suddenly thought, *"Last time, he didn’t die, and Lord Zhou said there must have been a reason. Perhaps he knows a way to avert disaster. Besides, drinking alone is no fun—I’ll buy some wine and food and go to his place. Maybe he can help turn misfortune into fortune!"*

Stopping at a market, he said, "Brother, you’ve just returned home, and we’ve never shared a drink. Since we’re going the same way, let’s buy some wine and dishes. I’ll trouble your wife to prepare them, and we can sit and talk. What do you say?"

With that, he took out some silver and bought wine and dishes. Shi Zongfu tried to stop him but could not, so he let him be. The two carried the food and, in high spirits, arrived at Shi’s doorstep. Shi Zongfu called to open the gate. Old Mrs. Shi, seeing that it was Old Peng, smiled and said, “Master Peng, how have you been? Why have you bought so much food?”

Peng Jian replied, “Sister, as you are an old friend of ours, I wish to share a drink with my brother and speak of some matters.” Old Mrs. Shi took the food inside and went to the kitchen to cook. Peng Jian and Shi Zongfu sat in the hall chatting. But Shi Zongfu noticed that Peng Jian’s words were disjointed, jumping from one thing to another without coherence, and grew suspicious. He thought to himself, *“Could it be that Lord Zhou sent him to pry into the matter? If he’s here to investigate, I must be on guard!”*

Before long, the dishes were ready, and Old Mrs. Shi called her son to bring them out. Peng Jian then invited her to join them at the table. After some polite refusal, they all finally sat down. Peng Jian personally poured the wine and filled the cups, drinking several in a row and sampling a few dishes. Then, unbidden, tears began to stream down his face. Old Mrs. Shi, seeing this, asked in confusion, “Master Peng, what troubles you? Why do you weep while drinking?”

Peng Jian only shook his head in silence. Shi Zongfu smiled and said, “Master Peng, drinking with brothers should be a joyous occasion—why this sorrow? There must be a reason! Are you suffering some injustice at another’s hands?”

Peng Jian replied, “Brother, you wouldn’t understand. I have urgent matters weighing on my heart, and so I weep.”

Old Mrs. Shi pressed, “Master Peng, what *is* the matter? Is it true or false? Why such grief? Won’t you tell us?”

Peng Jian said, “Sister, don’t ask! Today I am a man, but by the fourth watch tomorrow, I will be a ghost—never to see you or your son again!” As he spoke, tears fell like a shuttle’s thread. The mother and son hurriedly asked, “What do you mean?”

Peng Jian then recounted how Lord Zhou had cast his divination, foretelling great misfortune—how he was fated to spit blood and die at the fourth watch that night. He continued, “Sister, Lord Zhou’s divinations are never wrong. I fear my life is truly in peril. That’s why, on the road, I met Brother Shi and thought of how he once escaped death. He must know a way. I beg you and your son to teach me how to avoid this disaster—you would be the saviors of my life!”

At first, Shi Zongfu had suspected Peng Jian was sent by Zhou Qian to inquire about Peach Blossom Girl’s affairs. But now, hearing of the divination and Peng’s certainty of death by the fourth watch, he wept uncontrollably, moved to tears himself. His mother, too, shed tears, reflecting on their own misfortunes and feeling sorrow for another. She said, “Lord Zhou’s divinations are truly accurate. That night in the ruined kiln, if I hadn’t heard my mother’s call and stepped outside, I would have been crushed to death. Now he says you’ll die at the fourth watch tomorrow—it may well come true!”

Peng Jian asked, “Brother, how did you hear your mother’s call in that ruined kiln?” His question left Shi Zongfu speechless, his eyes fixed on Old Peng. Seeing this, Peng Jian knew there was more to the story—and he was not about to let the opportunity slip.

Hastily rising, he bowed deeply to Old Woman Shi and pleaded, "Good mother, have pity and compassion—teach me a way to save my life, and I shall never forget your kindness!" Old Woman Shi replied, "How could there be a way to save a man’s life?"

Seeing her evade the question, Peng Jian immediately knelt before her, saying, "As the old saying goes: *To save a life is better than building a seven-tiered pagoda.*" He kowtowed repeatedly, his forehead striking the ground like a garlic clove being peeled.

Old Woman Shi quickly called her son to help him up, saying, "How could I possibly save a man’s life? My son was saved by someone who gave him a method—otherwise, he would have died in that ruined kiln. He made me swear again and again never to reveal that person’s name, for fear your master Lord Zhou would learn of it and quarrel with him!"

Upon hearing this, Peng Jian suddenly recalled something and asked, "Good mother, was it a *yin* person who taught you that method?" Old Woman Shi was so startled that her face paled.

Whether the Shi mother and son would reveal Miss Ren’s name, and how Old Peng might be saved, will be revealed in the next chapter.

**Chapter Eight**
*Old Woman Shi Reveals the Secret of Salvation; Peach Blossom Girl Leaks the Divine Incantation*

At this, seeing Peng Jian’s desperate pleas and hearing him mention that her son had been saved by a *yin* person, Old Woman Shi was visibly shaken. She asked in alarm, "How did you know it was a *yin* person who saved my son?"

Peng Jian replied, "How would I know? It was only because Lord Zhou once cast a divination, saying that a *yin* person had secretly disrupted his Eight Trigrams, though he could not discern that person’s name. Since you know of such a capable individual, why not tell me? Then I may seek their help. If I, a withered stalk or lingering blade of grass, am granted further life, it will be a great act of hidden merit for you, good mother. I swear I will never reveal their secrets to outsiders."

With that, he prepared to kneel again.

Old Woman Shi, worn down by Peng Jian’s repeated entreaties and recalling how she too had once been in his place for her son’s sake, could not help but be moved. She thought to herself, *"I shall only direct him to seek help from Miss Ren. Whether she aids him or not will be her choice—I will speak vaguely and leave it at that."* Having settled on this course, she said, "Master Peng, I cannot possibly reveal this person’s name. But I will point you toward a path—it will be up to your fate whether you reach them. If you can meet this person, your Five Phases may yet be saved!"

Peng Jian, overjoyed at her words, urged, "Good mother, speak quickly!"

Old Woman Shi replied, "The Ren household next door belongs to the elder and his wife. Do you know them?"

Peng Jian answered, "We are old friends across two generations. In my father’s time, he and Elder Ren were on the best of terms, and even I have often visited them—though it has been a month since my last call. If I go to their home, they will surely insist on hosting me. Every member of their family, young and old, man and woman, I know them all, and they know me."

Old Woman Shi nodded and said, "Since you claim such generational ties with them, all the better! Today you need not go, but tomorrow morning, pay them a visit. When you see Elder Ren, speak of your misfortune—if fate favors you and you meet that capable person, they will surely be able to save you. They possess the power to deliver you. But under no circumstances must you reveal that I directed you to seek their help."

Upon hearing this, Peng Jian lowered his head in thought, then said, "Good mother, your words are somewhat unclear. The Ren household has many members—how am I to know who this capable person is? Whom should I ask for help?"

Shi Zongfu, standing by, curled his lip and said, "Master Peng, you are being rather troublesome! Since you know it is a woman, simply ask among the women of the household. Now, let us drink more!" With that, he poured cup after cup, urging Master Peng to drink several more. Only after securing this lead did Peng Jian’s mind ease slightly, and he drank several cups in succession before taking his leave. Old Woman Shi and her son reiterated their warning, insisting he must not reveal they had sent him. Peng Jian nodded repeatedly in agreement and hurried back to his estate.

The day’s conversation passed swiftly. That night, as he lay in bed—having drunk only a little—he found himself unable to sleep, tossing and turning until the red sun rose in the east. He rose at once, washed his face, changed into fresh clothes, and set off for Elder Ren’s home. Upon arriving at the gate, he informed the doorman, who relayed the message inside. Elder Ren himself came out to greet him, smiling, "Dear nephew, it has been many days since you last visited our humble home. Your arrival this morning is truly a joyous occasion. Why stand on ceremony? There was no need for announcement."

"Who in my household would need to avoid you? Please, come in!" Peng Jian hastily bowed and replied, "It is only proper to observe such courtesy. Though I am as close as family, I must not overstep my bounds." Elder Ren took Peng Jian by the hand and led him to the rear hall, saying along the way, "Old Mistress, our worthy nephew Peng has come."

Now, Elder Ren’s wife had no sons, and her greatest affection was reserved for Peng Jian. As maidservants went inside to announce his arrival, she had already come out to greet him, smiling from a distance, "What fine wind today has blown our worthy nephew here? Why have you not come to see us two old ones for a whole month?" Peng Jian forced a smile and replied, "Aunt, I have been much occupied of late and failed to pay my respects. I trust you are in good health, and that Peach Blossom is well?" The old lady answered, "Quite well."

The two elders invited Peng Jian into the rear chamber, where they had already instructed the servants to prepare a meal. By chance, Peach Blossom had just finished her morning toilette and come to the rear chamber to greet her parents, where she encountered Peng Jian. They exchanged courtesies, and the old lady instructed her daughter to sit beside them. After the maidservants served tea, Elder Ren’s wife said, "Nephew, your uncle and I—and your younger sister—often speak of how you spent more of your childhood in our home than in your own. As you grew, you remained simple and loyal. Yet in the blink of an eye, we two old ones are already over fifty."

Peng Jian replied, "I have always been showered with your kindness, as if we shared the same blood. There is not a day I do not think of coming to pay my respects. Only the burdens of official duties have delayed me." With that, tears began to stream down his face. Elder Ren and his wife assumed he was grieving over their advancing age and quickly consoled him, "Worthy nephew, why such sorrow?"

Peng Jian said, "Seeing you both in your later years, I cannot bear the thought of not being able to attend to you for long." Hearing this, the elderly couple’s hearts grew heavy as well. "Do not speak such inauspicious words," they said. "Though we are old, our bodies remain strong. We may yet share many years together." Peng Jian shook his head, tears flowing, and said, "May you both enjoy long life, but from this day forth, I will no longer be able to see you." With that, he broke into sobs. Startled, Elder Ren and his wife asked, "You are still in the prime of life—why speak such ill-omened words?"

Servants entered bearing trays of dishes. Elder Ren took his seat and said to Peach Blossom Girl, "Daughter, Brother Peng is no outsider—when you were small, he must have held you in his arms countless times. There is no need for you to withdraw today; come, join us for the meal."

Elder Ren and Old Peng sat facing each other, while Madam Ren and her daughter sat side by side at the end of the table. Elder Ren poured wine and passed it to Peng Jian, saying, "Worthy nephew, let your heart be at ease and drink!"

Peng Jian took the cup but set it down, saying, "It is not that I refuse the wine. Today, I came only to see my uncle, aunt, and younger sister—to express my feelings and fulfill my heart’s longing. How could I have the heart to drink?"

Elder Ren said, "Worthy nephew, ever since you entered the door, your face has borne a look of sorrow. First, you spoke of ominous things, and now your words grow even more confused. What, after all, is the matter?"

Peng Jian, tears streaming, replied, "This very night, at the fourth watch, I will die. I came only because I thought of how my uncle and aunt have cared for me, and so I wished to bid you both farewell—for from this day on, you will never see me again!" With that, he broke into loud sobs.

The Ren couple exclaimed in unison, "Where did such words come from?"

"How could a perfectly healthy man die in a single night?" Peng Jian then recounted what Master Zhou had told him from the divination. Elder Ren and his wife said, "So that is the reason. Master Zhou’s hexagrams are not necessarily infallible!"

Just then, Peach Blossom Girl, who had been standing by, saw Peng Jian so distressed—only later did she learn of the divination foretelling his death—could no longer bear it. She called out, "Brother, though my knowledge of divination is but slight, let me try my hand at it. Tell me your birth characters, and I shall calculate for you!" Elder Ren said, "I remember your birth characters as well," and promptly recited Peng Jian’s Eight Characters. Peach Blossom Girl counted on her fingers for a while, then started in surprise. "Master Zhou’s hexagrams were indeed unerring!" She fell into deep thought. The Ren couple hurriedly asked, "Daughter, is Master Zhou’s divination truly accurate?" The young lady replied, "The calculation is flawless. Tonight, at the fourth watch, he will vomit blood and die." The elder couple and Peng Jian all wept, asking, "Is there no way to save him?" Peach Blossom Girl lowered her head in silence. After a long pause, she counted again and said, "There is a way, but it is exceedingly troublesome." Elder Ren and his wife said, "Troublesome or not, we do not mind. For the sake of your parents, save Peng Jian!" The young lady replied, "This method is not to be spoken of lightly. Follow me to the rear garden, and I will tell you." She rose and led Peng Jian to the back garden.

Since the Ren and Peng families were as close as uncle and nephew, the elders paid no heed to the two of them and continued drinking in the rear tower. Peach Blossom Girl and Peng Jian sat down in a small pavilion in the garden. She asked, "Is there a Three Officials Temple within the city?" Peng Jian replied, "There is one, and its incense burns brightly." Peach Blossom Girl said, "I have calculated that tonight, on the fifteenth of the seventh month—the Zhongyuan Festival—the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper will descend to the Jade Capital to record the destinies of mortals. They will return at the second watch and alight at that temple to inscribe the cycles of rebirth. You must prepare a stick of incense, seven cups of pure water, and seven Dipper lamps. Bathe and change your clothes, then set them out in the Three Officials Temple at sunset. With utmost sincerity, recite the sacred name of the Great Sage, the Star Lord of the Northern Dipper, without cease. At the second watch, wait beneath the offering table. I will also give you a treasure pouch." She quickly took a golden bell from a brocade box and handed it to Peng Jian, along with a scroll of the Divine Radiance Incantation. "When the Star Lords descend, do not be afraid. Wait until they call your name, then step out from beneath the table, recite the incantation, and ring the golden bell to petition the Star Lords for longevity. They will surely grant it. This golden bell and incantation are meant to subdue the Star Lords. When you ring and recite, they will be seized with fear and headache. Once the matter is settled, return home and rest. You will be safe. If Master Zhou asks, do not reveal my involvement. This is of the utmost importance! Now go and do as I have instructed."

Peng Jian, upon hearing this, was overjoyed and exclaimed, "Sister, you are my great benefactor! When this matter is settled, I shall return to kowtow in gratitude!" With that, he took his leave. Seeing the two elders, Ren Taigong and his wife, he said, "The method of resolution must not be revealed. I must return home to carry out the instructions!" The two elders, upon hearing this, replied, "In that case, we shall not detain you further!" Ren Taigong then added, "If all goes well, you must come by tomorrow morning, Nephew, so that we two elders need not worry!" Peng Jian readily agreed, "That is only natural."

That evening, Peng Jian purified his body and, following the young lady’s instructions, completed every step. He had servants carry him to the Three Officials Temple and instructed the temple keeper, "No one is to enter tonight!" Alone, he knelt in the center, recited the sacred titles of the Northern Dipper Star Lords, and burned incense. As the second watch arrived, he heard a gust of wind—just as the appointed hour drew near—so he quickly concealed himself beneath the offering table. A waft of extraordinary fragrance filled the air, and voices spoke: "Whose offering is this? How did they know we Star Lords would descend? They have prepared so immaculately."

After a brief pause, he suddenly heard voices calling names from below, each one distinctly audible. Then came a sudden call: **"Peng Jian!"** A voice from the altar responded: **"Fated to live fifty years. Tonight, at the fourth watch, he shall die coughing blood!"** Peng Jian, hearing this, was struck with terror, his soul trembling in fear.

*How Peng Jian’s fate unfolds this night shall be revealed in the next chapter.*

**Chapter Nine, Volume Three**
*Peng Jian Seeks Salvation to Extend His Lifespan*
*Zhou Qian, Enraged, Smashes a Divination*
*A poem reads:*
*Why do I dwell in these emerald mountains?*
*I smile but say nothing, my heart at ease.*
*Peach blossoms drift on flowing waters, gone without trace—*
*Another realm lies beyond, not of this mortal world.*

Now, Peng Jian, crouched beneath the offering table, heard a deity call his name and declare, **"Tonight, at the fourth watch, he is destined to die coughing blood."** Terrified, he hastily recited incantations, striking his golden chime. Then he heard the Fire Virtue Star Lord demand: **"Who dares use spells to oppose us?"** Peng Jian poked his head out from under the table and saw nine august deities seated on either side, each of strange and fearsome appearance. He immediately prostrated himself in the center, ceaselessly reciting incantations and striking the golden chime.

The first Star Lord spoke: **"Peng Jian! Cease your noise and stop chanting! Do you seek extended life? Then plead before the fifth Star Lord."** The fifth Star Lord then declared: **"We have accepted his offerings, and he is a man of loyalty and kindness, free of wicked deeds. Moreover, the Peach Orchard Immortal instructed him to seek our aid, that we might alter his destined encounter with demonic forces. We shall now change his name and grant him added years—a sign that good is rewarded with good!"** He called out: **"Peng Jian! Come forward. We shall bestow upon you a new name: henceforth, you shall be called Peng Zu. We grant you a lifespan of one hundred years. The Left and Right Assistant Star Lords each grant you fifty years, and every Star Lord here grants you one hundred years—altogether, eight hundred and fifty years! On the third and twenty-seventh days of each month, you must fast, bathe, and reverently worship the Dipper. Do not reveal heavenly secrets, lest you incur divine punishment!"**

Peng Jian kowtowed and replied: **"This humble one, Peng Jian, having received the sacred gift of a new name and extended life, fears that living such a great span without wealth or descendants would only bring suffering. I beg the august deities to bestow some measure of prosperity, that I may live out my days in comfort!"** The Star Lords agreed: **"That is reasonable."** One deity drew a pill from his robe and instructed Peng Jian to swallow it, saying: **"This elixir will transform your bones and renew your body, rendering you free of all illness—so that you may enjoy the three blessings of fortune, emolument, and longevity!"** Then two of the deities each produced a ledger, and though Peng Jian could not see how they inscribed them, they finished writing and vanished in a gust of pure wind.

At that moment, Peng Jian felt his spirit invigorated a hundredfold, his heart brimming with joy. **Gentlemen, this is the very Peng Zu who lived over eight hundred years among men, taking thirteen wives—a man who enjoyed great fortune and longevity!** Truly:
*Without the golden elixir, even a century of life is hard to attain.*

This night had already passed the fourth watch when Peng Jian thought to himself: *"Miss Ren instructed me that once my task was complete, I should return to the mansion to rest. I understand her intent—she feared that if Lord Zhou saw I had not died and had spent the night away, he would surely grow suspicious and demand an explanation. Why not follow Miss Ren’s advice and hurry back to the mansion?"* With that resolved, he roused the temple warden, had the gates opened, and rushed back to the estate. Silently, he called for the main gate to be unbarred, entered his chamber, and collapsed onto his bed to sleep.

Meanwhile, Zhou Qian had sat alone until the fifth watch, convinced Peng Jian was dead. He took up the Heavenly Stem Sword, woke his page to carry a lantern, and personally went to Peng Jian’s room. Pushing open the door and stepping to the bedside, he saw Peng Jian lying motionless, face upturned, eyes half-closed. Believing him dead, he could not help but sigh in grief: *"Alas! A man of such lifelong integrity—now utterly gone!"* Hurriedly, he removed his golden crown, unbound his hair, and brandished his sword as he paced the Dipper steps, chanting incantations in an attempt to bind Peng Jian’s three *hun* and six *po* souls, preventing their dispersal. Only then did he intend to perform rites to guide him toward a favorable rebirth.

Unexpectedly, Peng Jian awoke with a start. Opening his eyes, he saw Lord Zhou with disheveled hair and sword in hand, pacing and chanting. With a grunt, he sat up—startling Zhou Qian so badly that the latter leapt back, sword raised, and barked: *"Vile ghost, cease your haunting! By the authority of the Most High Lord Lao, I command you—begone!"*

Peng Jian could not suppress a laugh. *"My lord, what rites are you performing?"*

Zhou Qian steadied his spirit and demanded: *"Peng Jian! Are you man or ghost?"*

*"I am a man—I never died. How could I be a ghost?"*

Zhou Qian then ordered his page to raise the lantern for a closer look. *"Strange, most strange! Who taught you the remedy to return from the brink of death? Speak at once!"*

Peng Jian replied, *"To die when fated not to die is to live a few years more. Why does my lord grow so anxious? Must I die for your wishes to be fulfilled?"*

Lord Zhou, displeased by these words, seethed inwardly: *"This wretch dares prevaricate to my face! I shall lure him to the study and interrogate him thoroughly—he must reveal who taught him the method to break my Eight Trigrams!"* Resolving this, he summoned Peng Jian: *"Follow me to the study!"*

Peng Jian dared not refuse and trailed after Lord Zhou, thinking to himself: *"He will surely press me for the truth. Even if I die, I shall never utter Miss Ren’s name!"* Before he knew it, they had arrived at the study.

Lord Zhou took his seat in the center, adjusted his topknot and cap, and set down the Heavenly Stem Sword. He then ordered his page: *"Summon several men to enter!"* Soon after, several servants filed in. Lord Zhou barked: *"Bind Peng Jian for me!"*

The servants dared not disobey and swiftly fetched ropes to bind Peng Jian. Peng Jian cried out: *"Peng Jian is innocent!"*

Lord Zhou, enraged, glared at him: *"You deceive me—how can you be innocent? Confess at once who devised the means to save you, or I shall have you put to death this very moment!"*

Hearing this, Peng Jian hastily knelt and pleaded: *"I am but a fool—what power do I possess? I had resolved to die that night, yet somehow slept through it and awoke alive—how, I cannot say!"*

Before he could finish, Lord Zhou roared: *"Bah! Lies, all of it! You will not speak the truth unless beaten!"*

The attendants were ordered: *"Give him one hundred lashes first!"* Two servants immediately fetched two leather whips, stepped before Peng Jian, and set to work—truly delivering a hundred strokes. The beating left Peng Jian sprawled upon the ground, wailing in agony.

Now, those in official households all claim the yamen’s impartiality, but how could it be so? These servants, moreover, had always been on good terms with Peng Jian—who among them would heartlessly flog him a full hundred times? In truth, no more than twenty or thirty lashes struck home. Thus, Peng Jian suffered little harm, crying out all the while: *"My lord wrongs me with this beating! I miscalculated the yin and yang myself—what fault lies with another?"*

Lord Zhou flew into a rage: *"You’ve always been honest—today you dare lie to me! Very well, I’ll not beat you further. Attendants, bind him with another rope around his waist and hoist him up beneath the eaves!"*

By now, Peng Jian felt the pain keenly, yet mindful of Peach Blossom Girl’s lifesaving kindness—the earnest instructions she had given him the night before, warning him never to reveal her name—he gritted his teeth and said nothing.

Lord Zhou strode down the steps and pressed him: *"Speak the truth at once, and not only will I spare you punishment, I shall reward you handsomely. I see your face aglow with crimson light, your lifespan extended—you must have met some extraordinary person who taught you the art of bone-transformation and rebirth. Tell me everything!"*

Hearing this, Peng Jian’s heart lurched: *"How sharp his insight! Not only are his divinations accurate, but his physiognomy is flawless as well. Since I cannot deny it, I’ll say nothing at all and see how he questions me further."* With that, he squeezed his eyes shut and sealed his lips.

Upon seeing this, Lord Zhou’s fury blazed. He turned and strode back to the main hall, seized the Heavenly Stem Sword, and rushed before Peng Jian, roaring: *"Peng Jian! If you refuse to speak, you commit the crime of deceiving your lord!"* With that, he raised the sword in a vicious arc, poised to strike.

Peng Jian’s eyes flew open—his soul scattered in terror. *"Spare me, my lord!"* he shrieked. *"I’ll tell you everything!"*

Lord Zhou snarled: *"If you delay another instant, I’ll cleave you in two!"*

Hastily, Peng Jian blurted: *"It was Ren Taogong’s daughter, Ren Taohua—neighbor to Shi Zongfu on the left—who instructed me. Last night at the third watch, she told me to go to the Three Officials Temple and await the arrival of the Star Lord of the Northern Dipper to beg for longevity. That is how I survived."*

Hearing this, Lord Zhou ordered Peng Jian released. He returned to the central hall, seated himself, and demanded: *"Peng Jian! Why did you not speak sooner?"*

Peng Jian bowed in apology, then added: *"Miss Taohua repeatedly warned me never to tell you, my lord, fearing you would grow angry and bear a grudge against her. Even Shi Zongfu was taught by her."*

At these words, Lord Zhou could not suppress his rage.

*"Wretched schemer! First she shattered my Eight Trigrams formation—let that pass—but now she sends the Shi mother and son to humiliate me. I swear I shall not rest until I’ve settled this!"*

Peng Jian, hearing this, hastily kowtowed: *"My lord, I beg you not to bear a grudge against this lowly one! If you do, it will only implicate me in her misdeeds. Have mercy, my lord—her parents have but this one daughter, and she is still so young."*

Lord Zhou asked: *"How old is this wretched girl?"*

*"She has just turned sixteen this year,"* Peng Jian replied.

The chronicler adds: Though Peach Blossom and Lord Zhou descended to the mortal realm one after the other, why is Lord Zhou so much older? Because in heaven, a single moment spans many years on earth. Lord Zhou arrived but an hour or two before Peach Blossom, and thus is decades her senior.

But enough digression. When Lord Zhou heard Peng Jian’s truthful account, he rewarded him with ten taels of silver to tend his wounds. Peng Jian expressed his gratitude, and Lord Zhou warned him: *"You are forbidden to breathe a word of this to the Ren household. If I learn you have spoken of it, your punishment will be doubled!"*

*"I dare not! I dare not!"* Peng Jian replied, bowing repeatedly before retiring to his quarters.

Lord Zhou pondered in secret: *"Peach Blossom is but a child—how could she possess such mastery of the Dao? I find it hard to believe. I must verify whether the Northern Dipper truly descended last night."* He swiftly calculated the hour and confirmed: indeed, at the first quarter of the third watch, the Northern Dipper had descended upon the Three Officials Temple east of the city. His heart filled with dread: *"Peach Blossom’s arts truly commune with the divine! With her in Zhaoge, I fear I shall never escape her influence."* He paced the flower tower, lost in thought, until a sudden inspiration struck: *"Why not... thus and thus... to erase this grudge from my heart!"* Resolved, he summoned a servant named Xu Cheng and commanded: *"Fetch the official matchmaker at once."*

Xu Cheng departed, and Lord Zhou waited. What scheme he devised to harm Peach Blossom, read in the next chapter.

**Chapter Ten: A Deceitful Betrothal—Coercion and Trickery Seal Her Doom**

Lord Zhou ordered his servant Xu Cheng to summon the official matchmaker. Before long, Xu returned with a woman surnamed Jiang. Seeing the hall crowded, Lord Zhou dismissed all attendants, seated himself in the center, and beckoned the matchmaker forward. She kowtowed, and he smiled as he spoke: *"Matchmaker, do you know the Ren household south of the city? They have a daughter called Peach Blossom. Do you know her? Have you ever seen her?"*

The matchmaker replied: *"I know the Ren matriarch—her family is wealthy, with tens of thousands in assets, and they are upright folk. As for Miss Peach Blossom, I have never laid eyes on her, so I dare not speak idly. From what I gather, she must be sixteen or seventeen."*

Lord Zhou said: *"I have heard this young lady is of refined appearance, and I wish to betroth her as my daughter-in-law. If you succeed in arranging this, I shall reward you handsomely!"*

The matchmaker hesitated, thinking: *"I have never heard of Lord Zhou having a son. This request is most peculiar!"* Seeing her reluctance, Lord Zhou grew displeased and pressed: *"Why do you remain silent?"*

She replied: *"It is not that I refuse to speak. I only wonder—how could a commoner like Ren Taogong dare to ally with Your Lordship?"*

Lord Zhou said: *"You need only go and propose it. I wish to take her as my daughter-in-law, and the wedding must be held within three days. They need not provide a single dowry item."*

Before he could finish, the matchmaker interrupted: *"This is impossible! Who ever heard of a bride entering her husband’s home in three days? The deadline is far too tight—it would only send me on a fool’s errand. I suspect Your Lordship has some ulterior motive. Why not confide in me? Whatever happens, if the Rens raise objections, you can intervene. What harm could there be?"*

Hearing this, Lord Zhou’s anger turned to delight: *"You are indeed clever. I shall tell you the truth—I intend to punish Peach Blossom for shattering my Eight Trigrams formation. I have no son; this is merely a ruse to lure her here so I may kill her. The third day hence is an inauspicious day when malevolent spirits descend, so I have set the date. The moment she steps from her palanquin, her life will be forfeit. This is a secret method to dispose of her—you, as the matchmaker, bear no responsibility. If you succeed, I shall reward you with a hundred taels of gold, and I shall not go back on my word."*

"Ah, so that is the reason!" exclaimed Matchmaker Jiang. "No wonder Your Lordship was so enraged. But Peach Blossom is merely a sheltered maiden—how could she have disrupted Your Lordship’s Eight Trigrams formation? If she can be secretly done away with, leaving no trace, I am more than willing to make the journey. Only, we must devise a scheme to trick Old Master Ren into agreeing."

Pleased that Matchmaker Jiang’s words aligned with his own, Lord Zhou’s heart swelled with delight. "Not difficult at all," he said. "Let me first calculate the omens to see how it should be done." He swiftly counted on his fingers, then declared, "The ruse for the betrothal is set! I’ve just divined that Old Master Ren is not at home—he has gone to his estate and will return tomorrow at the Hour of Si. I shall send Xu Cheng with you to wait at his gate. You must do exactly as I say: if he complies, all is well; if he refuses, tell him I will report his daughter to the authorities for using sorcery and unholy arts to shatter my Eight Trigrams formation. He will have no choice but to agree!"

Matchmaker Jiang, overjoyed at the plan, replied, "This scheme is brilliant! I shall go tomorrow."

Lord Zhou was overjoyed and rewarded Matchmaker Jiang with wine and food, then presented her with twenty taels of silver. Matchmaker Jiang, ecstatic, bowed in gratitude and returned home.

The next day, she met Xu Cheng as arranged, and together they left the estate. Along the way, they finalized their plan and proceeded straight to the Ren residence. Just as they arrived, it was the Hour of Si, and Old Master Ren appeared from the distance. The two exchanged delighted glances, murmuring, "The Duke’s divination is truly divine!" As they thought this, Old Master Ren reached his gate and dismounted. A servant carried a bundle of clothes behind him.

Seeing Matchmaker Jiang and another man waiting at his doorstep, Old Master Ren smiled and said, "Madam Jiang, why do you not come inside to sit? What brings you to stand at my gate?" Matchmaker Jiang greeted him with a cheerful face and replied, "Master Ren, see what I have in this basket? Yesterday was the day my daughter served tea to her betrothed, and I must deliver gifts to all the families involved. Here are some tea cakes for you and the mistress of the house. Since you’ve just returned, perhaps your young servant could take them inside for you." With that, she handed the basket to the attendant following Master Ren.

Old Master Ren said, "So your daughter has set a wedding date—how wonderful! Please, come inside for some tea."

Matchmaker Jiang promptly assented and, together with Old Master Ren and Xu Cheng, entered the main hall to take their seats. She then retrieved the basket from the young servant’s hands and presented it to Master Ren, saying, “Master Ren, pray take a look—it’s nothing much, just a small token of respect.” Old Master Ren repeatedly demurred, “You honor me too much,” before accepting the basket. Upon lifting the lid, he saw a piece of red silk covering the contents, adorned with a pair of golden floral hairpins. He reached in, removed them, and set them on the table, revealing a dozen or so delicate pastries nestled within.

Matchmaker Jiang, ever the eager hostess, urged from the side, “Master Ren, do try one!” Now, Old Master Ren had come straight from the countryside without having eaten, and his stomach was indeed empty. Moreover, the pastries looked exquisite, and the old man, fond of sweets as elders often are, found himself unable to resist—especially with Matchmaker Jiang pressing him so. Without thinking, he plucked one and placed it in his mouth.

Just then, the young servant brought out tea. Old Master Ren offered it to his guests while pouring himself a cup, savoring the pastries slowly as he sipped. “What fine pastries!” he remarked. “Truly, their fragrance fills the mouth.”

Matchmaker Jiang, feigning playfulness, took up the pair of golden hairpins and stepped forward to pin them on Old Master Ren’s head, laughing, “How delightful! How delightful! Today we take this as an auspicious sign—let me find you a fine concubine tomorrow, Master Ren, so you may yet sire a son!” Old Master Ren, taking it as mere jest, replied with a chuckle, “That would be quite impossible.”

Xu Cheng, seizing the red silk, draped it over Old Master Ren’s shoulders. Then, both he and Matchmaker Jiang knelt in unison and kowtowed, exclaiming, “Congratulations, Master Ren! Felicitations, Master Ren!”

Startled, Old Master Ren quickly asked, “Why do you both jest so?” and reached out to help them rise.

The two rose and said, “Let us speak plainly! This was sent by Duke Zhou for Master Ren. His son wishes to marry your daughter, and he too is sixteen this year. Only, the matter is urgent, and we feared you might refuse, so we devised this ruse to deceive you. Pray, do not take offense!”

Old Master Ren, now realizing it was a betrothal trick, grew furious and said, “Marriage is a weighty affair—both families must consent. Does he rely on his ducal power to bully common folk? Do I fear him so much that I dare not speak, and must yield to him? I shall *not* agree to this match, and let him do his worst!”

Matchmaker Jiang replied, “Master Ren, do not be angered. This is his servant, whom I brought along. I told him you might refuse. The Duke said, ‘No matter. If he refuses, I shall accuse him in court of using sorcery and black magic to disrupt my Eight Trigrams!’ Consider—every official in Chaoge City is on good terms with him. You may yet come to harm!”

Old Master Ren, upon hearing this, remained silent and mused to himself, *"I regret letting my daughter meddle in others’ affairs. If I refuse now, he will take me to court, and I shall surely suffer. Besides, I have already eaten his betrothal cakes."* He then thought, *"A daughter must marry someday. To be matched with the Duke of Zhou’s son—what an honor!"* Turning to the two, he said, “Gentlemen, is it not a fine thing for this old man to be allied with the Duke? Yet there is still the disparity in status, and I have not even met the young master. Moreover, the wedding date is too soon.”

Matchmaker Jiang smiled and replied, “For the Duke to ally with you, Master Ren, is to become one family. Besides, his household took the initiative in seeking this match. His son, raised in luxury, must surely be handsome. The only issue is the haste of the date. The Duke has already considered this and instructed us to say, ‘If Master Ren finds the date too soon, he may forgo all dowry—only the young lady need come as she is.’”

Hearing this, Old Master Ren’s heart filled with joy. “If that is the case, I must still discuss it with my wife. I cannot decide alone.” Matchmaker Jiang said, “The husband is the head of the household. If you consent, your wife will surely agree. We shall now return to report the good news to the Duke—that you have given your blessing!” Xu Cheng nodded in understanding, and the two departed.

Left alone, Old Master Ren sat in the main hall in a daze, turning the matter over in his mind. A smile crept upon his face as he thought of the honor of such a high match, forgetting all else. He rose, beaming, and made his way inside. When Mistress Ren saw him enter with such cheer, she stood and said, “Master, you’re back!” Noticing the golden flowers in his hair and the red silk draped over his shoulder, she could not help but laugh. “Master, what’s the occasion? Are you officiating a wedding today, or have you taken a concubine, decked in flowers and silk, to bow before heaven and earth?”

Old Master Ren chuckled. “Neither, my dear. I bring good news—for both of us!” He sat down and recounted in detail the Duke’s proposal. “You once said our daughter bore the marks of nobility. Now it has come to pass! We old folk shall bask in her glory!”

Mistress Ren, delighted, replied, “For a common family to wed into nobility—what honor! But to send her without any dowry would be improper.” Old Master Ren smiled. “What need have we for dowry? Everything she wears and uses is new. We can prepare the rest in three days and send it to the Zhou estate—it will not be late. There is only one thing: I wonder if our daughter will be pleased. Let us go and speak with her.”

Mistress Ren, finding Old Master Ren’s words reasonable, accompanied him to the rear garden. There they saw Peach Blossom Girl alone, carrying a flower pot, watering a peach tree. The two elders called out together, “Daughter, why trouble yourself to water the tree? Let the maidservants do it.” Seeing her parents enter, Peach Blossom Girl quickly set down the pot, and they all ascended the flower pavilion to sit.

Noticing her father adorned with flowers and draped in red, Peach Blossom Girl smiled and asked, “What joyous occasion has made you don these today, Father and Mother?” Mistress Ren spoke first: “The happiness of us two elders is all thanks to you, my child.” She then recounted in full how “the Duke of Zhou had sent a matchmaker to propose marriage, and your father has already agreed to your departure on the nineteenth.”

Before she could finish, Peach Blossom Girl’s face turned ashen yellow. With a cry of “Oh no!” her body collapsed helplessly from the chair to the ground.

Whether Peach Blossom Girl’s life would be spared, or if she would consent to the marriage—these matters shall be revealed in the next chapter.

---

**Chapter Eleven**
*Resenting the Marriage, Demanding Betrothal Gifts*
*Invoking Malevolent Forces, Poisoning with Schemes*

The moment Peach Blossom Girl heard her parents had promised her in marriage to the Zhou family, she could not bear to listen further. Overcome with fury, she writhed in her seat before collapsing to the floor.

Just as:
*A tender blossom, drenched by rain, wilts powerless,*
*A slender willow, buffeted by wind, bends beyond endurance.*

Seeing their daughter sprawled upon the ground, Old Master Ren and his wife were struck with terror, their souls scattering like lost spirits. They rushed forward together, lifting her up, crying, “Our precious child! What ails you so?”—and burst into tears.

Peach Blossom Girl, once seated again, brooded in silence before speaking: “Father, Mother—how could you act so rashly, falling into another’s snare? This is all Lord Zhou’s scheme, and now we have walked straight into his trap! I have learned that Lord Zhou has no son at all, and his wife passed away long ago. He has only a daughter, who is already sixteen this year. Now he insists on marrying me at once and demands I enter his household within three days. I am certain this is all because of Brother Peng’s affair. Seeing how I shattered his Eight Trigrams, shame turned to fury, and now he seeks this marriage only to use his arts to kill me. I fear this may be the last time I see you both—we may never meet again!”

Old Master Ren and his wife, hearing these words, were struck dumb with terror. “Why speak such ill omens when all was well?” they stammered.

Peach Blossom Girl, no ordinary mortal, foresaw events as clearly as if they had already come to pass. She hastily calculated on her fingers and saw through the hidden truth: “The nineteenth day is when the Malevolent Spirit descends—a day of great misfortune. Lord Zhou has chosen this day to strike me dead!”

Old Master Ren’s fury erupted. “Lord Zhou is truly despicable! How dare he plot such harm!”

“I’ll not spare this old life of mine—I’ll fight him to the death! We’ll take this to the magistrate; I fear him not!” With that, he tore the red-and-green betrothal headdress from his head, crumpled it to shreds, and stamped it underfoot.

Peach Blossom Girl thought to herself, “Since I was sent down by the Jade Decree to break Lord Zhou’s arts, I cannot escape my fate. Better to set my parents’ minds at ease and spare them this distress.” She said, “Father, Mother, put your hearts at rest! This is Heaven’s decree—I do not fear him! Yet after raising me all these years, I have repaid you nothing; I have failed in my great debt to you.”

Old Master Ren and his wife, hearing this, wept tears of pearl. “How can we consent to this inauspicious, baleful day?” they cried.

Peach Blossom Girl replied, “To others, this day would bring harm, but I can break its curse. If others could be saved from it, how could I not save myself? Do not worry, Father and Mother—I do not fear it! I shall return within three days. Tell them I require Lord Zhou to provide me with several things, and then we may proceed with the chosen day.”

Old Master Ren, overjoyed, asked, “What does he need to prepare? I’ll send the matchmaker to fetch it at once.”

Peach Blossom Girl said, “Nothing extraordinary. I require two feet of red silk, embroidered with the Eight Immortals of the Grotto-Heavens on the bridal sedan. The sedan must be adorned with multicolored silks, and a pair of empty treasure vases, filled with the Five Grains and an iron. When the sedan arrives at our gate, burn sandalwood and cypress leaves in the vases and iron, and have one of his household carry the iron, circling the sedan three times before I enter. Only then may the sedan pass through the gates. At both the outer and inner gates, place a horse saddle and a square peck measure. The bride must step over the saddle after alighting from the sedan before bowing to Heaven and Earth. From his main gate to the inner hall, he must lay out a carpet of colored felts so that the bride’s feet never touch the ground. He must also send his tailor to await our instructions. If Lord Zhou refuses even one of these requests, I shall not marry into his household. Moreover, his son must come to marry in—he must enter our family as a son-in-law. Father, see to it that all is prepared without delay or error!”

Old Master Ren committed every word to memory, then took up the Four Treasures of the Study and listed each item on paper, ensuring not a single one was omitted. Knowing their daughter possessed such skill and feared not Lord Zhou, the couple cast aside their worries and rejoiced. “Daughter,” they said, “since you can break his arts, we are at ease. When the matchmaker arrives, we shall have her request these things from Lord Zhou.”

The two elders left the garden in high spirits, while Peach Blossom Girl remained behind, making preparations to counter Lord Zhou’s arts.

Meanwhile, the matchmaker Jiang and Xu Cheng returned to the estate and reported to Lord Zhou, “Old Master Ren has agreed to the marriage, with the bride to be fetched on the nineteenth.”

Lord Zhou was overjoyed. He rewarded the matchmaker with silver and Xu Cheng with ten taels of white silver. Fearing the Rens might change their minds, he instructed Jiang and Xu to prepare the betrothal gifts and wine boxes at once, along with several maidservants from his household. Laden with sheep and wine, they set off to present the gifts at the Ren residence.

Upon arrival, Old Master Ren had his servants entertain the guests in the main hall while the women were ushered into the inner chambers. Without inspecting the gifts, he ordered them taken directly to the great kitchen. The matchmaker and the maidservants entered the inner room, kowtowed, and offered their congratulations. Old Mistress Ren then said, “Matchmaker Jiang, how could you be so careless? I am not angry about the deception in this marriage, but why choose the nineteenth—a day of great misfortune? Lord Zhou is a man of reason; why did he not check the almanac and instead try to deceive me with this paper coffin? I shall not pursue the matter further. But go back and tell Lord Zhou this: prepare all the items for the bridal procession. If even one is missing, do not blame us for breaking our word. Let him take us to court—I am willing to face the magistrate!”

The matchmaker bowed and replied, “Old Mistress, please calm your anger! If the items are impossible to find, then perhaps they do not exist. But if they can be found, I guarantee Lord Zhou will provide them all without fail.”

Old Master Ren said, “They are not impossible to find—just everyday objects. Here is a red list with everything written clearly. Take it back to Lord Zhou and have him send them as specified.” He handed over the red paper.

The matchmaker, unable to read, asked, “Master Ren, please read it aloud so I know what these items are.”

Old Master Ren recited the list. The matchmaker laughed and said, “I thought they were things rare as phoenix feathers or unicorn horns! These are simple enough—no trouble at all! Leave it to me; not a single item will be missing!”

“Old Master Ren said, ‘Pray inform Lord Zhou that the items requested today were divined by a yin-yang master, who declared the day most inauspicious. These objects may avert the omen—otherwise, my daughter will surely perish. Hence my persistence. Though I am but a commoner, I would not renege on my word to break the betrothal. Lord Zhou, as a nobleman of high rank, must not begrudge fulfilling this request. You may all return now!’

The matchmaker assented repeatedly, then hastily took leave of Old Master Ren with her companions and rushed back to the manor. Upon seeing Lord Zhou, she exclaimed, ‘The Ren household is most formidable! It is as if they have a divine informant—every detail of Your Lordship’s affairs seems foreknown!’ She then presented the red list of requested items.

Lord Zhou took it and glanced over it. ‘This is no difficulty,’ he said. ‘I shall comply with every demand. Go quickly and inform them that I shall provide all as specified. When the time comes, have Peng Jian deliver them, and let them be used as they see fit.’

The matchmaker, having heard this, returned to Old Master Ren’s residence to relay the message.

Now, Lord Zhou’s *Tian Gang Divine Manual* contained only methods of divination, not means of countering omens. Thus, he had taken the items requested by Peach Blossom Girl lightly, paying them no further mind.

On the evening of the eighteenth, Lord Zhou sat alone in his study, calculating the positions of the inauspicious spirits’ descent. He discerned that the Four Absolutes and Four Annihilations lay in the northeast, the Wailing Spirit in the north, the Heavenly Net and Earthly Snare in the east, while the Dipper-Wood Beast, Ghost-Metal Ram, Mao-Day Hare, and Star-Sun Horse converged in the northeast corner. Greatly pleased, he declared, ‘The gathering of these malevolent forces aligns perfectly with the direction of my chamber—no need to summon them. Were it another, a single countermeasure would suffice to claim their life.’”

Lord Zhou mused, “Peach Blossom Girl must possess some skill—else why would she demand so many items? What if these are not mere trifles but the very means of countering my scheme? Should she outmaneuver me and escape this calamity, her prowess would be proven, and what face would I have left? Better to make this a case of ‘an open spear is easily dodged, but a hidden arrow is hard to guard against.’ Since she cannot possibly calculate the descent of these malevolent spirits, why not secretly summon a few more baleful deities to lie in wait at every direction? The moment her bridal palanquin passes, whichever fiend she encounters shall claim that wretched harlot’s life! Even if she wields some sorcery, she will have no time to counter them all!”

Having settled on his plan, he hastened to bathe and change his robes. Tucking the *Celestial Stem Divine Manual* into his breast, he grasped the Celestial Stem Sword and entered the rear garden. There, he instructed his attendants to prepare a table laden with incense, flowers, lamps, candles, fresh brush and ink, and yellow paper, then ordered all servants to withdraw and forbade them from peering inside. He barred the door and waited until the third watch of the night.

At last, Lord Zhou approached the table, removed his golden crown, and unbound his hair. Drawing forth the *Celestial Stem Divine Manual*, he copied its talismanic seals onto yellow paper with cinnabar ink. Holding the sword in his left hand, he burned the talisman with his right, recited the incantation, and pointed the Celestial Stem Sword skyward. A gust of eerie wind arose, and as it subsided, a wisp of smoky cloud descended, bearing a celestial general of fearsome aspect:

A golden helm bristling with baleful qi,
A face black as ink, brows thick as brushstrokes,
Eyes like lanterns upon Mount Ao,
A beard stiff as needles,
A bamboo-node steel whip gripped in hand—
By Heaven’s decree, he was named the Great Marshal,
And the two characters “Black Fiend” struck terror into gods and ghosts alike!

With a thunderous sound, the deity materialized before the table, bowing deeply. “For what purpose does the ritual master summon this spirit?”

Lord Zhou swiftly closed his eyes and replied, “I would not dare disturb your eminence without cause. Tomorrow at the Hour of Si, Peach Blossom Girl will wed. I humbly beseech your aid: go to Elder Ren’s home and await her. When she boards her palanquin, strike her dead within it with your steel whip, then return to your post.”

The deity assented, “I obey the ritual command!”—and vanished in an instant.

Lord Zhou then burned a second talisman. With equal swiftness, a figure descended from the heavens: disheveled hair, clad in mourning garb, a yellow porcelain urn in the right hand and a funeral staff in the left. This was the Funeral Gate Deity, overseer of mortal deaths. Seeing the god’s overwhelming presence, Lord Zhou again closed his eyes.

The deity bowed and asked, “What task does the ritual master assign?”

“Forgive my presumption,” Lord Zhou said. “Tomorrow at the Hour of Si, Peach Blossom Girl’s bridal palanquin will arrive. I beg your eminence to wait at the left of the gate. Should she step from the palanquin, strike her dead with your divine might, then return to your post.”

The deity replied, “I accept the ritual command!”—and vanished in a gust of wind.

Lord Zhou hastily burned a third talisman, summoning the Hanging Guest Deity, whom he stationed at the right of the gate, charging him to strike Peach Blossom Girl dead before returning to his post.

As for the fourth talisman and the deity it summoned—what mighty spirit would descend? That shall be revealed in the next chapter.

**Chapter Twelve**
*Overt Snares and Hidden Escapes*
*Foreshadowing the Future’s Secrets*

The White Tiger Deity stood a full *zhang* in golden stature, his painted halberd held aloft in hand. His silver helm gleamed with the aura of life and death, his armor clad in scales like dragon’s mail. A belt of polished jade and precious gems girded his waist, while his five-colored battle boots stirred auspicious clouds. His face was powdered pale, his brows sharp as drawn blades, his eyes flashing fourfold—terrifying to behold!

When asked his name and title, he declared: “I am the White Tiger Deity, mightily ruling the four directions.”

The White Tiger Deity approached the altar and asked, “What command does the ritual master have for me?”

Lord Zhou replied, “I would not dare trouble you without cause. Tomorrow at the Hour of Si, the bridal procession for Ren Taohua will arrive. I humbly beseech your divine power to manifest your might: when she enters the bridal chamber for the *zuo zhang* ritual, devour this woman to death—only then may you return to your post.”

The White Tiger Deity received the talismanic decree and vanished in a shimmering ascent into the sky. Thus, Lord Zhou had summoned all four principal deities. He put away the *Book of Heavenly Stem Divinities*, smoothed his hair, and ordered the attendants to clear the altar offerings. Returning to his chambers, he rejoiced inwardly.

“Ren Taohua!” he mused. “Even if you possess the power to reverse heaven’s will, you cannot escape this calamity! Though I have summoned these four mighty deities with the darkest malice to harm you, this is a disaster of your own making!”

After some reflection, as the fourth watch of the night approached, he finally retired to sleep. The night passed without incident.

Meanwhile, Ren Taohua, determined to prove her superiority over Lord Zhou, had already prepared all her treasures. The next morning, after completing her toilette, she hurried to the rear garden to water her peach tree, only to feel a sudden unease. She quickly calculated the hidden patterns of yin and yang, then could not help but chuckle to herself. “Lord Zhou!” she murmured. “You still underestimate me. Now you’ve summoned four malevolent deities to secretly harm me—what a futile effort! How could you ever succeed?”

She rushed back to her embroidered chamber, opened a brocade pouch, and took out a small peach branch. Carrying it to the rear garden, she began to chant under her breath. With a breath of qi, she blew upon the branch and commanded, *“Swift as thought, return to true form!”* In an instant, the branch elongated, transforming into a seven-foot halberd, its blade gleaming like a painted halberd. She grasped it in hand, unbound her raven tresses, and let them cascade over her powdered face. With one hand forming a mudra and the other raising the halberd, she recited an incantation and cried, *“Red Calamity Deity, descend at once!”*

Ren Taohua’s foundational Daoist arts surpassed Lord Zhou’s. Having cultivated for years in the Jasper Pool and possessing a celestial tome bestowed by Qi Zhenren—the foremost among all divine sages—her invocation was the *Qi Zhenren’s Summoning Spell*. Thus, without burning talismans or pacing the Dipper, a gust of wind swept by, and a deity descended, clad in golden helmet and armor, standing in the peach garden. “What task does the Dharma Master require of me?” he asked.

Upon seeing the Red Calamity Marshal descend, Ren Taohua swiftly closed her eyes and said, “Lord Zhou Qian, the fortune-teller, has recklessly revealed heavenly secrets. Though I have twice thwarted his schemes, he remains unrepentant, refusing to mend his ways and avert celestial wrath. Now, with malice in his heart, he has deceived me with false kinship, secretly dispatching the Black Calamity Marshal to lie in wait at the gate, intending to strike me down the moment I board the bridal palanquin! I have no choice but to enlist your divine power for protection. When the time comes, if the Black Calamity Deity raises his steel whip, I beg you to intercept it with your golden whip. Only after I have safely departed in the palanquin may you escort the Black Calamity Deity back to his post. Disobey, and you shall face the penalties decreed in the celestial tome!”

Peach Blossom Maiden cast her incantation, and the Red Calamity Deity vanished with the wind. Miss Ren slowly bound her raven tresses, then blew a breath of immortal qi upon the painted halberd—whereupon it once more became a slender peach sapling. Breaking three tender branches from the tree and one from the willow, she carried them back to her embroidered chamber. There, she fashioned a small bow and three arrows, setting them aside. Next, she took several strands of cotton thread, crossing them left and right in the pattern of a sieve, weaving warp and weft with meticulous care. Having consecrated them with a dharma seal, she gathered all the items together.

As the hour approached mid-morning, the sound of drums and music reached the gate, their resonant clamor filling the air. Suddenly, Elder Ren and his wife, both clad in auspicious robes, hurried in and called out, “Daughter! The Zhou family’s bridal palanquin has arrived—what will you do now?”

Peach Blossom Maiden, hearing this, could not help but shed tears. “Father, Mother! You have raised this daughter for sixteen years in vain. Today, when I go to the Zhou household, they will never accept me. A fierce battle awaits, and whether I live or die cannot be foretold. Yet there are a few words I must say—both of you must heed them well!”

Elder Ren and his wife had already begun weeping bitterly. “Do not fret so, my child,” they said. “Go forth with ease in your heart; surely Zhou Gong’s sorcery cannot overcome yours. Speak your mind plainly—what is it you wish to say? We, your parents, will grant whatever you ask.” Then the maiden began to recite:

"Where neither yin nor yang reaches its end,
Do not say that doing good bears no fruit.
Though childless now, a son shall come in time—
When fate arrives, even daylight takes flight!
Riding twin clouds of wood to jade palaces,
The hour of *zi*, *wu*, *jia*, *wu* marks the appointed day.
Not a thread deviates from heaven and earth’s decree—
The Peach Garden has long awaited the lone parasol tree.
Thus is revealed the joy of doing good in the human realm!"

This foretells how Elder Ren and his wife shall one day ascend in broad daylight to become the celestial guardians of the Peach Garden. But this is the denouement’s tale, and no more shall be said of it.

When Peach Blossom Maiden finished speaking, she added, “The hour of *si* has arrived—this daughter must now prepare. Father, Mother, do not grieve!” Yet how could Elder Ren and his wife restrain themselves? The two elders stepped forward, clasping their daughter’s hands, and wept aloud.

At this moment of bitter parting, a maidservant announced, “Master Peng has come!” Hearing this, the couple stifled their sobs and looked up to see Peng Jian entering. He addressed them, saying, “Uncle, Aunt, kind cousin—cease your lamentations. I have something to report.”

Elder Ren, upon seeing him, flared with anger: “Peng Jian! Are you a man of honor? My daughter repeatedly charged you not to speak, yet you have let it slip, allowing Zhou Gong to record this grudge and forge this enmity. Now he uses this ruse of marriage to ensnare my daughter! He has no true son—he only waits for my child to depart before plotting against her. If my daughter returns unharmed, so be it; but if any mishap befalls her, I shall stake this old life of mine to settle accounts with you and Zhou Gong both. There can be no peace between us!”

Peng Jian, hearing this, flushed crimson with distress, stamping his feet as he protested, “I never spoke outright that day! Zhou Gong questioned me again and again, even striking me hundreds of times, yet I refused to reveal anything. Finally, in a rage, he drew his sword, threatening to kill me—I had no choice but to confess. He then punished me, forbidding me to leave, so I could not come to inform you. My offense is grave as the heavens, and now I see he has used this marriage ruse…”

Before Peng Jian could finish, Peach Blossom Maiden interjected, “Father, Mother, do not blame him wrongly.” Then, turning to Peng Jian, she said, “Brother, Zhou Gong sent you here—this is no time for idle talk. I have matters of great weight to entrust to you; you must follow my instructions to the letter.”

“I have some items to entrust to you.” With that, she quickly fetched a bow and arrows, handing them to Peng Jian and saying, “Take these and keep them on you. When my bridal sedan enters the gate, you must act thus and so.” Peng Jian nodded repeatedly. She then gave him a sieve made of thread, whispering further instructions. Peng Jian took it, slipped it out discreetly, and placed it inside the sedan chair. Peach Blossom Maiden, carrying the various items, wore a pearl crown adorned with eight treasures, a crimson python robe, and a pair of yellow satin Daoist shoes, refusing to let them touch the ground—she stood upon the kang, fastening her jade belt.

Just then, Matchmaker Jiang arrived and entered the main hall. She presented a three-foot length of red silk, a pair of treasure vases filled with the five grains. Peach Blossom Maiden instructed her to drape the red silk over her head and carry one vase in each hand. Silently, she mused, *“This woman’s heart is crooked—I shall use her in my stead this time.”* Then she called out, “Auntie Jiang, do not leave my side. Tomorrow, when you come to my home, I will reward you with twenty taels of silver.” Delighted, Matchmaker Jiang replied, “Miss, this old woman is here to assist you into your new home—how could I dare accept the master’s reward?” Master Ren said, “As long as you carefully support her, once my daughter has crossed over, I will give you twenty taels of silver—my word is true.” Then the young lady called for her father to lift her into the sedan chair.

The implements and objects Peach Blossom Maiden had used that day were originally meant to subdue and dispel malevolent spirits. Yet later generations, in nearly all wedding processions, followed this same form and practice, until it became an established custom and essential ritual.

In an instant, Master Ren carried Peach Blossom Maiden away, weeping loudly: “My child! Though your old father carries you out today, may you live as long as your parents, come of age in full health, enjoy a hundred years of marital harmony, see your descendants flourish, and know boundless fortune and longevity—nothing ill shall touch you.” Mistress Ren followed close behind, accompanying them for a stretch before breaking into loud sobs. Such was the sorrow of mother and daughter parting, a grief too deep to bear. Moreover, she had no sons, only this daughter, and now, with this farewell, she knew not whether fortune or misfortune awaited—her anguish was unbearable. Her wailing moved even Old Peng to shed a few tears.

Miss Peach Blossom was carried into the bridal sedan by Master Ren and had just taken her seat when suddenly a gust of eerie wind blew toward the palanquin. A steel whip lashed out—it was the Black Baleful Spirit, summoned by Master Zhou, striking the moment she boarded. But from the left, a golden whip flew forth, parrying the steel one, and the Red Baleful Spirit revealed his true form. Seeing his whip blocked, the Black Baleful Spirit cried, “I was sent by Magistrate Zhou under the authority of the Celestial Stem and Earthly Branch to strike down Ren’s Peach Blossom Maiden. Why does Your Excellency interfere with your golden whip and rescue this girl? Now I cannot fulfill my command—what am I to do?”

The Red Baleful Spirit replied with a conciliatory smile, “I, too, was summoned by Peach Blossom’s master, the Qi-True Man, under divine incantation to save her. The two of them are locked in a contest of yin and yang, of wit and strategy, yet ultimately, Peach Blossom acts in accord with the Dao. She was dispatched by the Jade Decree to descend to the mortal realm, provoking Master Zhou to contend with her so that both may return to their origins and avoid falling into the dust of the world. Their reunion is not far off—why should we two obey their private summons and risk discord?”

The Black Baleful Spirit, hearing this, said, “Your Excellency’s words align deeply with the profound and wondrous Dao.”

"Return each to your proper station." At once, the two spirits mounted the clouds and ascended to heaven. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.

**Chapter Four, Episode Thirteen: The Wicked Contends with the Righteous—Divine Beings Act Without Partiality; True and False Yin-Yang Follow Their Course**

To continue: When Miss Ren Taohua’s bridal sedan arrived at Master Zhou’s gate, the Red and Black Baleful Spirits manifested their presence—one upholding Master Zhou’s celestial *Tian Gang* orthodox dharma to strike down Miss Taohua, the other obeying Miss Ren and the Qi-True Man’s divine incantation to shield and rescue her. The two divine beings having clarified their origins, they promptly mounted the clouds and returned each to their proper station.

Only Miss Taohua’s bridal sedan proceeded forth from the gate, drums and music resounding to the heavens, flutes and pipes filling the road. Countless servants cleared the way before and behind, their saddled steeds adorned with carved saddles. The townsfolk lining the streets, seeing that Master Zhou—a retired minister—was taking a bride, marveled at the sedan bedecked in silks and brocades, embroidered with the eighteen grotto-heavens’ immortals encircling it, its frame wrapped in red satin. Truly, it dazzled the eye, and all exclaimed, “The gentry and the common folk are worlds apart!” Some, knowing Master Zhou had no son, remarked, “A second wife, of course, must be grandly received!” Hearing this from within her sedan, Taohua seethed with resentment: “Were it not for my destined encounter with Zhou Qian, how could I avenge today’s humiliation?” Along the route, the eighteen grotto immortals’ effigies kept all malevolent spirits at bay, so Taohua remained unharmed.

When the sedan reached the Zhou residence, Ren household servants instructed the matchmaker Jiang: “Quickly, summon the Zhou family to perform the sedan incense ritual!” Jiang entered and relayed the message to Master Zhou. After the incense ritual, Zhou asked Jiang, “When you saw Ren Taohua board the sedan, did you hear any unusual sounds?” Jiang replied, “This humble woman stood nearby and saw her parents carry her into the sedan—there was no sound at all.” Hearing this, Zhou was astonished and said, “How strange! It seems this Taohua’s powers are no small matter.”

Even the Black Death Marshal could not touch her—what use were the lesser malevolent spirits outside the gate? Yet he had secretly summoned the Funeral Gate and Mourning Guest deities to flank her, to see what dark arts or powers this yin-born woman might wield to break his spells.

Turning to the matchmaker Jiang, he said, “Since she insists my servants perform the sedan incense ritual, why should I not do it myself? Attendants, quickly bring me the iron and heat it. Place cypress leaves and rue inside—let me purify the sedan so this yin-born woman may enter!”

His servants had already prepared the items; they handed them to Master Zhou, who seized them and rushed outside. Circling the bridal sedan three times, he remained unaware that cypress and rue were banes to evil spirits—within moments, the wailing specters and all manner of malevolent forces had fled, unable to stand their ground. Only Miss Taohua, hearing Zhou perform the ritual himself, could not help but smile in secret. “What a fool this Zhou Qian is!” she thought. “He does not even know that cypress and rue dispel all manner of evil spirits.”

This alone proved Zhou’s inferiority to Taohua: every item she employed was meant to counter his malevolent forces, yet Zhou understood none of it. He merely assumed Taohua possessed some power to subdue the spirits, unaware of the mutual generation and restraint among all things.

Once Zhou finished purifying the sedan, he strode back inside, tossed the iron and its contents aside, and ordered, “All bystanders, stand clear! Wait until the bride dismounts in the main hall before you—” His intent was clear: knowing he had set a vicious trap, he expected Taohua to reveal her own arts the moment she stepped into the hall. He wished to display his own prowess while settling the score for her repeated dismantling of his eight trigrams. Today, he fully expected Taohua to perish inside the sedan, and would later spread word that the master’s command had been to halt only at the main hall, where the sedan was to be carried.

However, Peng Jian had received Taohua’s transmitted arts and now oversaw the sedan-bearers. As they lifted the sedan, he strode ahead, positioning himself at the gate with his back to the outside and face toward the courtyard. Drawing a willow bow and a peachwood arrow, he nocked the arrow, raised the bow, and cried aloud:

*Willow bow, peachwood arrow,
Strike the left door, then the right,
Funeral Gate and Mourning Guest vanish without a trace,
All malevolent spirits flee from sight.*

As Peng Jian nocked the arrow and recited the incantation, he loosed it straight at the center of the gate. The Funeral Gate and Mourning Guest deities, most vulnerable to these implements, could not endure the twang of the bowstring—they instantly ascended on clouds, returning to their posts. This is why, in later ages, households would hang willow bows and peachwood arrows above their gates during inauspicious years.

At that moment, the Duke of Zhou believed that Peach Blossom Girl could never drive away the two malevolent deities, and that she was surely doomed. Thus, he secretly slipped out to observe from the side, even personally wielding an iron to circle her palanquin—though this was merely a pretext to step out. Little did he know he had already fallen into Peach Blossom Girl’s calculations!

Just as Peng Jian loosed his first arrow, delighted by its strike, he prepared to fire a second. Unexpectedly, the arrow flew straight toward the Duke of Zhou’s face. Quick-eyed, the Duke cried, *"Ill fortune!"* and dodged, barely avoiding it as it grazed past his ear. Enraged, he roared, *"Who dares act so recklessly, firing arrows here!"* Glancing up, he saw Peng Jian holding a small bow and shouted, *"How dare you, Peng Jian! To loose an arrow at me in secret!"*

Startled by the rebuke, Peng Jian hastily dropped the bow and replied, *"How could I be so bold? This was at Miss Ren’s command—she instructed me to shoot at the left and right gates, saying that Your Grace had summoned the two guests of Funeral Gate and Mourning Guest to lie in wait there, intending to harm her. She bade me fire these arrows to drive away the two baleful stars so she might alight from her palanquin and enter safely. I was but following orders; it has nothing to do with me!"*

Hearing this, the Duke of Zhou gasped, *"Alas!"* He swiftly calculated on his fingers, stamping his feet as he exclaimed, *"Disaster! All my painstaking efforts have been in vain—I have ruined my own scheme!"*

"Leave at once."

At this, the Duke of Zhou entered the inner hall and sat down, musing to himself: *"Though the baleful stars of Funeral Gate and Mourning Guest have been thwarted by this yin-born woman, many other malevolent spirits still gather here—what countermeasure will she employ now?"*

Meanwhile, Peach Blossom Maiden had alighted from her bridal palanquin. A matchmaker supported her as she stepped onto the red felt laid across the halls, inside and out. Clad in golden satin slippers that touched no earth, she walked slowly forward. Just as she neared the second gate, she saw Peng Jian retrieve a sieve woven of thread from the embroidered palanquin. Hurrying to her side, he tossed it high with both hands, lowering it to enshroud the beauty’s head as he recited the incantation:

*"Thread-woven sieve becomes the net of heaven,
Red felt binds the tripping rope tight.
The saddle bridles the star-and-sun steed,
Sheep flee at the sight of mortal grass—gone without trace!"*

As Peng Jian chanted the verse taught by Peach Blossom Maiden, he reached the second gate and scooped handfuls of straw from a square measure, scattering it in all directions. Seizing the moment, Peach Blossom Maiden swiftly stepped over the saddle, then drew a precious vase from her person. From it she poured five grains onto the ground.

Truly:
*To mortals, it seems but a trifling act,
Yet to immortals, its power is manifest.*

Thus Peach Blossom Maiden proceeded to the great inner hall. By now, all the maidservants and matrons of the Zhou household knew that the Duke had sought to slay Miss Ren with sorcery the moment she stepped from her palanquin. Seeing her unharmed, they realized her magic was the greater, and the Duke’s schemes had been undone. Hearing further from Lady Jiang of her beauty—so fair it could sink fish and shame geese, a visage of celestial grace—who would not crowd close to glimpse her? The great inner hall was soon packed so densely that the yin qi grew overwhelming.

The malevolent spirits, restrained all along by Peach Blossom Maiden’s arts, dared not approach. Seeing her pass the critical position and the yin qi swell further—many women present being impure—the spirits feared contamination by defilement, lest they be barred from returning to their posts. Thus they mounted the clouds and departed, each to their proper place.

When the Duke of Zhou saw Peach Blossom Maiden enter unscathed, passing through three gates to reach the inner hall in perfect safety, his Three Corpses seethed with fury, smoke rising from his seven orifices. He cursed aloud: *"What formidable skill this yin-born woman possesses! She has undone my sorcery at every turn. Our enmity runs deep—I swear I shall never coexist with such a one!"*

Hearing Matchmaker Jiang call out, *"The Ren family’s people insist on summoning the groom to perform the bows—what is to be done?"* the Duke of Zhou grew frantic, wringing his hands in helplessness. *"What plan can I devise now?"* he muttered to himself. After a moment’s thought, finding no recourse, he reluctantly ordered his beloved daughter, Miss Tianxiang, to stand in as the groom. *"Quickly, send the maids to fetch my daughter!"* Then he summoned the housekeeper and instructed her thus and so.

The housekeeper approached Peach Blossom Maiden and said, *"His Lordship says today is an inauspicious day, and the groom must not meet the bride. He has sent my young lady to perform the bows in his stead, temporarily taking the groom’s place to enter the bridal chamber."*

Peach Blossom Maiden listened, inwardly delighted: *"Now I have a substitute—I need not expend further effort!"* She stood still, handing the precious vase to Matchmaker Jiang. Secretly, she drew a bronze mirror from the brocade pouch at her breast and tucked it into her sleeve, raising both hands in a dignified bow, her plan already set.

Presently, Miss Tianxiang entered, the air filled with the resounding clamor of drums and music. The two beauties exchanged bows and courtesies before performing the wedding rites. A retinue of maids followed them into the bridal chamber.

Once inside, Miss Tianxiang lifted the red silk veil from Peach Blossom Maiden’s face. Gazing upon her, she saw a vision no less radiant than a celestial maiden of the Jade Palace or the Moon Goddess Chang’e, and her heart swelled with admiration. *"Alas!"* she sighed inwardly, *"what a pity—such a thousandfold beauty, doomed to die by my father’s schemes. How pitiful!"*

Peach Blossom Maiden, in turn, regarded Miss Tianxiang and thought:
*Her brows curve like crescent moons, her eyes shine bright as autumn stars,
Adorned with jeweled hairpins, her grace outshines all others—
A single glance reveals her tender charm.*

*"What a rare beauty!"* Peach Blossom Maiden mused. *"A face seldom seen among mortals. Yet how tragic—tonight she will die in my place!"* Both maidens shared a silent sorrow, their hearts aligned, though neither would perish—of this, more later.

Miss Tianxiang spoke first: *"Sister Ren, please come and sit upon the bridal bed."*

How would Peach Blossom Maiden respond? Could she evade the White Tiger Star lurking there? For that, await the next chapter.

**Chapter Fourteen: Peach Blossom Maiden Uses the Dao to Break the Dao—The Duke of Zhou Plots Harm but Meets His Own Demise**

Peach Blossom Maiden and Miss Tianxiang, having met, each felt a tender pity and affection for the other. Yet Peach Blossom, being a celestial maiden born of the Daoist arts, understood all that had passed and all that was to come. Tonight, though compelled by circumstance, she would let Miss Tianxiang take her place.

Thus, she gave a cold laugh and said to the young lady: *"You are the honored guest—pray, take the seat of honor."*

Miss Tianxiang replied, *"Then I shall keep you company."*

Miss Tianxiang said, *"Sister, you are my elder—tonight I merely stand in for my brother. How could I presume to take the seat of honor?"*

Peach Blossom Maiden said, *"Since you presume to take your brother’s place, you are the bridegroom in his stead and should sit first."*

Miss Tianxiang, knowing her father intended hidden harm against her yet lacking any means of escape, was compelled by necessity. Eager to see the matter done so she might return to her chambers, she remained unaware of the peril in the seating’s orientation. Seeing the logic in Peach Blossom’s words, she said, *"In that case, I shall defer to you, Sister—pray forgive my presumption in sitting first."* She then moved to take the upper seat upon the bed.

Peach Blossom Maiden swiftly drew the embroidered curtain to shield herself, while silently reciting the incantation to summon the spirits. The White Tiger Marshal was roused, and with a gust of raging wind, revealed his true form. That fierce and malevolent star was truly formidable! Seeing a yin-person seated upon the bed, he let out a roar and lunged—biting deep into Miss Tianxiang’s shoulder.

Alas!

In an instant, the tender blossom met with a sudden storm—who could have foreseen the fragile bud would encounter such a violent gale! At that moment, Miss Tianxiang cried out *"Ai-yo!"* and tumbled from the bed, blood streaming from her mouth. The women below witnessed this and were struck with terror! They rushed forward to lift her, only to find her face ashen as gold paper, fresh blood flowing from her lips—already stiff and lifeless. The women called to her in vain, their wails growing louder and louder. Someone hurried to report to Lord Zhou.

Lord Zhou, hearing the sudden lamentations from the chamber, assumed Peach Blossom had fallen to his scheme, and that the Jia household was now in mourning—his heart swelled with joy. But then came the messenger’s report: *"The young lady has collapsed and died for no reason in the bridal chamber!"* At first, Lord Zhou refused to believe it, but upon hearing these words, he felt as though he had lost his footing on a high ridge or capsized in the Yangzi—he dashed to the bridal chamber, cradled his daughter in his arms, and wailed, *"Why has she died here today, so suddenly and without cause?"*

Peach Blossom, upon hearing this, let out a faint, cold laugh. *"Lord Zhou! Who do you think you’re trying to frighten with your daughter? Such words may deceive the foolish, but how could they ever fool me?"*

"Last night, you summoned the White Tiger inauspicious star to bite her to death—that’s why she bled just now. A fine young lady, ruined by your own sorcery, and now you weep?" Upon hearing this, Lord Zhou flushed with shame and fury, his lamentations stilled.

He raised his gaze to regard Peach Blossom, seeing her:
Clad in crimson from head to toe,
Her celestial charm rivaled the immortals’ grace.
At first glance, Lord Zhou mistook her for some ancient scholar’s refined beauty—
But now, beholding her eyes like autumn waters and her bones of jade, he could not help but falter: *"No wonder this yin-born wretch is so formidable—her very appearance sets her apart!"*

Swallowing his pride, he forced a smile and addressed her: *"Miss Ren, you understand this matter, while I remain in the dark. Might there be some divine method to revive my daughter?"*

Peach Blossom laughed. *"Lord Zhou, your study of the *Tian Gang* formulas was not in vain—yet how is it you know only how to cast spells, not how to break them? Instead of blaming others for disrupting your *Tian Gang* Eight Trigrams, should you not fault your own lack of skill and imprecise Daoist arts? Since you now seek my aid, reviving your daughter is no difficulty. Fetch me counterflow water from the river and willow branches, and I shall perform a minor technique before your eyes—she will revive at once, leaving you utterly convinced!"*

What is counterflow water? When the great sea rises in tide, the small river ebbs; when the small river rises, the great sea ebbs. Taking the small river’s rising tide—with the great sea as reference—this is counterflow water.

Lord Zhou found Peach Blossom’s words grating, but with his daughter’s life at stake, he dared not argue. He immediately ordered his servants: *"Quickly, fetch counterflow water and willow branches!"* In the time it took to exhale, both were brought before him.

Peach Blossom had a cool bamboo mat laid upon the ground. They lifted Lady Tianxiang onto it, positioning her supine, and barred all idle chatter. Unhurried, she took several willow twigs, dipped them in the counterflow water, swirling them thrice to the left and thrice to the right. Then, with mudras and incantations, she flicked the water from the willow onto Tianxiang’s face. Truly, the wonders of an immortal’s craft: after three recitations and three sprinkles, Tianxiang’s three *hun* and seven *po* returned to her body, her *qi* reversed its course, and she returned to the living. *"Ah!"* she gasped, *"How terrifying!"* Her apricot eyes flew open, and with a roll, she slowly sat up on the mat, dazed.

Every servant and maid rejoiced, marveling: *"Miss Ren’s arts reach the divine—she truly possesses the power to raise the dead!"* Lord Zhou, his face burning with humiliation, had no choice but to step forward and bow in gratitude to Peach Blossom.

When Tianxiang revived and saw that it was Peach Blossom who had saved her, her heart brimmed with endless gratitude. She knelt to thank her for the gift of life, then, without returning to her own chambers, remained by Peach Blossom’s side in the bridal room. The two, kindred spirits drawn to one another, admired each other deeply—both of the same age, their bond was one of perfect harmony. But of this, no more shall be said.

Lord Zhou, overwhelmed with shame that day, sat alone in his study, brooding in silence: *"Today, all those malevolent spirits and fierce deities were thwarted by that yin-born woman—only to have the White Tiger Star’s general bite my daughter to death. Though she was revived by Peach Blossom’s hand, I despise how she flaunted her abilities, humiliating me before all those women! My original plan to deceive her into marriage failed to kill her, and now she sits safely in my estate. Moreover, in three days’ time, she will meet the groom—what can I possibly offer her? I must devise a fatal scheme to eliminate this yin-born woman. First, to rid myself of this worry; second, to vent the hatred in my heart!"*

He hastily retrieved *The Divine Book of Heavenly Stems* and, after obtaining Peach Blossom’s birth date and hour, meticulously calculated her life’s fate. Upon careful divination, he discovered the method of *"Black Hound Suppression"*—a technique with no possible countermeasure. Lifting his head, he chuckled, *"Had I known this was the fire, the rice would have cooked long ago! If I had used this method earlier, I would have spared myself so much frustration!"*

With that, he put away *The Divine Book of Heavenly Stems* and stepped into the outer hall, summoning a servant: *"Take a string of copper coins and immediately purchase a black female hound from the due south. Bring it to the rear garden for use—do not delay."* The servant received his orders and departed. Before long, the black hound was bought and delivered to the garden’s keepers.

The night passed without incident. The next day, Lord Zhou summoned Peng Jian and instructed him: *"Go to Squire Ren’s rear garden, where there is a worm-eaten peach tree. Select a branch from the due south side, chop off a large one, and bring it to me—I have use for it. Carry it straight here without turning your head to look back! If you dare glance back, your eyes will be blinded. Do not say I did not warn you."* Peng Jian received his orders, hurried to Squire Ren’s estate, and informed the squire. In the rear garden, he chose a towering peach tree and hacked off a branch from the southern side, then rushed back to the manor.

Lord Zhou was overjoyed. *"Is this the southern branch?"* he asked. *"Good. Take it to the rear garden."* Peng Jian carried the peach branch and followed Lord Zhou to the garden, where the black hound was led out. Lord Zhou ordered a ritual table set with offerings of flowers, fruit, incense, and candles. He snapped the peach branch in two, dipped it in cinnabar, and inscribed Peach Blossom’s birth date and hour upon it. Wrapping it in yellow paper, he had it tied to the black hound’s body, then bent the branch into a loop and fastened it around the hound’s neck. With the peach branch, he drew seven talismanic seals, personally hanging them on the loop before his hands traced mudras and his lips murmured incantations—seven times over. He then peeled off the talismans, burned them with fire, and removed the inscribed branch and loop, reducing all to ashes. At once, he had the black hound struck dead. The servants were ordered to bury it in the due south of the rear garden, and the offerings were cleared away. Lord Zhou burst into laughter: *"Wretched woman! Now let’s see how you escape me!"*

It so happened that the peach branch was Peach Blossom’s life-root; by cutting it first, Lord Zhou had already subdued her vital mechanism. Peng Jian, standing outside, had secretly watched the proceedings. Seeing Lord Zhou’s elaborate ritual, he grew suspicious; when he heard the lord’s cold, triumphant words, his heart sank. *"This is bad!"* he thought. *"He truly means to harm Miss Ren! I must hurry and warn her so she can prepare!"* As an old minister long in Lord Zhou’s service, Peng Jian moved freely through the manor, unchallenged. He rushed straight to Peach Blossom’s bridal chamber.

Meanwhile, ever since Peach Blossom had revived Miss Tianxiang, the latter, deeply grateful and perfectly matched in temperament, had scarcely left her side. The two chatted and laughed together until the third watch before retiring to their rooms. That day, as Peach Blossom was dressing early in the rear pavilion, Miss Ren sat alone in her chamber, pondering how to return home. Suddenly, she was seized by a fit of dread, her flesh crawling. Hastily, she calculated with her fingers and understood at once. *"Lord Zhou has cut my life-root!"* she cried in alarm. *"He’s using the Black Hound Suppression method against me, and he has my birth date and hour. Even if I had the powers of an immortal, I could not escape this calamity. What am I to do?"* She was lost in distress when suddenly Peng Jian rushed in.

Before his feet had even steadied, he gasped for breath and cried, "Dear sister and benefactor, today is ill-fated—great disaster has come!" He then recounted in full detail how Lord Zhou had once more performed his arts in the rear garden, preparing to subdue her, and how he had ordered him to cut peach branches for the purpose.

Peach Blossom replied calmly, "Brother, do not fret. I already knew of this. This is called the Black Hound Suppression, a venomous scheme of demonic arts. Yet this time, I fear I cannot escape this calamity—my life is surely forfeit! But recall how I saved you before; now, I ask that you save me in return!"

Upon hearing this, Peng Jian hastily replied, "If there is any way I, Peng Jian, can serve you, sister, I would plunge into boiling water or tread upon fire, and ten thousand deaths would not deter me!"

Peach Blossom, hearing his words, rejoiced greatly. "Good," she said, "then my younger sister is out of danger." How she would break the spell, however, remains to be seen in the next chapter.

**Chapter Fifteen: Peach Blossom Thrice Unravels the Celestial Stem Method; Zhou Qian Again Deploys a Demon-Suppressing Scheme**

*Poem:*
Yin and yang reverse in ceaseless flux,
Their clash dims the sun and moon’s bright luster.
The common folk gaze upward, lost in dread,
While mighty Heaven departs its clouded realm.
Hand in hand with sun and moon, one ascends to paradise,
Standing serene beside the Emperor’s throne.
How resplendent, how pure—beyond earthly garb,
All things rejoice in harmony, raising cups of rhinoceros horn.

Now, Zhou Gong had employed the Black Hound Suppression to bring about Peach Blossom’s death. Peng Jian, desperate, asked how she might be saved. Peach Blossom replied, “This is a demonic art—even the highest immortals of the Great Luo Heaven would struggle to escape its bonds. It severs the three hun-souls from the body and scatters the seven po-souls to the void. There is no doubt: this is a death from which there is no return.

But, dear brother Peng, recall how I saved you yesterday. Today, I ask that you repay that kindness and rescue me.”

Peng Jian, frantic, stamped his foot and cried, “If I had the power to save you, I would not need to tell you—I would have already broken his spell and rescued you!”

Peach Blossom said, “I do not ask you to break his spell. Only follow my words, and I will be saved.”

Hearing this, Peng Jian rejoiced. “Whatever you command, how could I dare ignore it? See how I did not fail in a single task you entrusted to me yesterday. Speak quickly, so I may go and fetch—”

Peach Blossom continued, “You heard Zhou Gong’s order to cut down the peach tree at my home. That tree is my life-root; if you sever it, it will be as if you’ve dammed the source of a river. Even if I could transform or take flight, it would be of no use. Tomorrow at the *wei* hour, my death will come.”

Peng Jian sighed. “How can this be? I am but a fool, untrained in the arcane arts. Otherwise, even if he commanded me to die, I would not go!”

Peach Blossom said, “There is no use in regret now. Tomorrow at the *wei* hour, my death is certain. But I have devised a way to escape it: after I die, Zhou Gong will surely have me encoffined at once. When they lift my body to place me in the coffin, do not wait until I am inside before acting. The moment they begin to raise me, take three wooden staves and bar the door. Strike the bolt three times, then cry out loudly, ‘Peach Blossom!’ Kick the door open with your right foot, and I will revive by my own wondrous means. Do not fail in this!”

Peng Jian replied, “The timing must be exact—neither too early nor too late. You must watch closely and act the moment they lift me.”

“Just think—how far is it from here to the main gate? By the time I run there, you may already have been encoffined for some time. How can that work?”

Peach Blossom replied, “Brother, you are right. In my haste, I did not explain clearly. When the hour of *shen* arrives, you may go ahead and wait outside the main gate. When you hear a gust of fragrant wind pass by, that will be the moment they lift me. Then you must act swiftly, just as I instructed!”

Peng Jian nodded and said, “If the timing is precise, what difficulty could there be? But if there is no fragrant wind, do not blame me!”

Peach Blossom assured him, “It will certainly come.”

Peng Jian, still half-doubting, replied, “If the fragrant wind truly serves as the sign, then you may rest easy—I will take full responsibility!” With that, he hurriedly took his leave and departed.

Peach Blossom, alone in her chamber, prepared the magical talismans she would need to protect herself after death. She placed each one into a brocade pouch and fastened them to her innermost garments. Just as she finished, Miss Tianxiang, having completed her morning toilette, entered the room. The two exchanged courtesies and sat down to converse. Peach Blossom did not breathe a word of her father’s dark schemes, instead laughing and chatting as if nothing were amiss, until evening fell.

Miss Tianxiang dined with Peach Blossom before taking her leave to retire to her own chamber. As for Peach Blossom, she did not close her eyes all night, sitting on her bed with her eyes shut to rest her spirit. When dawn came, she rose, washed, and dressed, forgoing her usual hairpins and jewels. Instead, she coiled her hair in a Daoist style and donned a pale green Daoist robe, her demeanor cheerful and unburdened, revealing nothing.

That day, Zhou Gong remained uneasy. He secretly sent someone to observe her, and the messenger returned to report that her countenance showed no sign of distress, nor had she made any unusual movements. Upon hearing this, Zhou Gong rejoiced, saying, “This time, I have suppressed her life-star—she is surely dazed and powerless!”

When noon arrived, he hurried to the rear garden, inscribed a hastening-death talisman, and began pacing the Dipper steps as he intoned the incantation. Just as he finished burning the talisman, Peach Blossom and Miss Tianxiang were in the boudoir, deep in conversation, when suddenly Peach Blossom cried out and collapsed to the floor. Miss Tianxiang and the maidservants, unaware of the cause, were startled and rushed forward to help her up.

Seeing her breath entirely stilled and her body limp as silk, she appeared beyond all hope of life. Truly:

While three inches of qi serve a thousand uses,
Once the last breath departs, all affairs cease.

At the sight, Miss Tianxiang was so stricken that her limbs failed her. She burst into loud sobs, crying, “Sister! How could you, so sound and well, suddenly perish without cause? Alas, your youth, your moon-bright face and flower-like beauty—now you are gone forever. How can this not rend the heart?” She stroked the lifeless form, her grief sharp and piercing. The maidservants all began to weep, their wails rising like the heavens splitting and the earth cracking.

Peng Jian hurried into the room, equally stunned. “Truly, what fearsome sorcery! The exact hour of *wei*—not a moment’s deviation!” In his haste, he glanced over and saw Peach Blossom lying on the ground, her complexion still as in life, only her lips tightly clenched. Overcome, he too began to wail. Then, suddenly recollecting himself, he muttered, “Why am I weeping here? I must hurry to the main gate and wait—saving her life is the only matter of consequence!”

Rubbing away the tears from her eyes, she rushed out the main gate to wait. Word soon reached Duke Zhou. Overjoyed at the news, he personally strode into the chamber. Seeing Peach Blossom indeed lifeless, he sneered, “Wretch! Can you still escape my grasp now?”

Lady Tianxiang, her eyes brimming with tears, pleaded, “Father, though Ren Taohua has offended you and deserves death, remember how he saved your daughter’s life. Show him mercy—spare him a little, and revive him if you can!”

Duke Zhou laughed. “What do you, a child, know of such things? This is fate already sealed—who could bring him back?” He then ordered his servants, “Ren Taohua died at the third quarter of the *wei* hour, his baleful influence too heavy to linger. Waste no time—prepare his funeral at once. Seal the coffin swiftly! Afterward, send word to the Ren household and choose a day for the burial. Place him in the small room to the right of the main hall. No wailing from the women!” He further commanded the gatekeepers to bolt the doors, lest any of the Ren household’s maidservants slip away to deliver the news.

Little did he know that the gates had already been shut—too late to stop Peng Jian’s desperate efforts. Soon, all the funeral preparations were made, the necessary items laid out in the outer hall. Duke Zhou forbade anyone from changing Peach Blossom’s clothes and instead dispatched four maidservants to carry her body for the encoffining. The four maids, following orders, attempted to lift the corpse—yet no matter how they strained, it was as if dragonflies sought to shake a stone pillar. Not an inch could they budge it.

The onlookers gasped in astonishment: “How can such a slight frame be so impossibly heavy?” Seeing this, Duke Zhou added four more maids to the effort—yet still they could not lift her. Enraged, he bellowed, “This wretch played tricks in life, and even in death she dares defy me? All of you—help me lift her!” But no matter how many joined, it was futile. The maids strained until their breath came in ragged gasps, their bodies drenched in sweat, yet all cried, “We cannot move her!” Duke Zhou roared at them to stand aside and summoned forty of his strongest retainers.

The men strode forward, some gripping her head from either side, others seizing her feet, still more bracing her midsection—hands tangled in a frantic scramble, their shouts rising in confusion. “How bizarre! It’s as if she’s rooted to the earth—we cannot even sway her!” Duke Zhou’s fury erupted like thunder. Snatching his Heavenly Dipper sword, he swung it down upon Peach Blossom’s shoulder with a resounding *clang*—sparks flew, the hilt numbed his tiger’s mouth, and his hands stung with pain. “What an indestructible corpse!” he snarled. He hacked at her head and face again and again, yet not even her garments bore a single tear.

The retainers and maidservants exchanged stunned whispers: “This woman must have been a cultivator of the Dao—her body is incorruptible!” Hearing their awe only stoked Duke Zhou’s rage further. With a furious shout, he demanded, “Bring me dry kindling—now!” His attendants dared not delay, rushing to gather armfuls of wood. Duke Zhou ordered it piled upon Peach Blossom’s body, intending to burn her remains to ash.

One retainer knelt and ventured, “If we set fire, won’t it—”
Duke Zhou cut him off with a roar: “Fetch it at once! I have my methods—do you think I’d let the hall burn? Light the fire—now!”

The retainers swiftly fetched the kindling and ignited it beneath and around the corpse. Yet something uncanny occurred: though they lit it for some time, the flames would not catch, and if one side flickered to life, the other would immediately die out. Duke Zhou bellowed at his servants to add oil, drenching the wood, but the oil seemed only to smother the fire like water, extinguishing what little flame remained. Thick smoke billowed forth, choking Duke Zhou and his household until tears and mucus streamed down their faces, sending them scrambling into the courtyard to catch their breath.

Duke Zhou mused, “Carry the wood out first—we’ll burn her slowly. There must be some reason for this. Let me calculate and see what sorcery this yin-being has wrought to interfere.” He hastily began his divination, then sighed, “I was careless! She used the *Double-Body Technique* to protect her remains, fearing harm after death. Now, I shall summon the Six Ding spirits and invoke the gods—let’s see how this yin-being escapes *that*!”

With that, he unsheathed his *Celestial Stem Sword*, removed his golden crown, and let his hair fall loose. As he chanted incantations under his breath, the myriad deities were already alerted, descending upon Duke Zhou’s estate—though their golden forms remained invisible in daylight. Suddenly, a fragrant breeze swept through the hall, and Duke Zhou knew the gods had arrived. He ordered all but four of his attendants and maidservants to withdraw, declaring, “This time, just four men will be enough to lift her!”

Time seemed to stretch, but in an instant, Peng Jian, who had been waiting impatiently at the gate, grew anxious with doubt. Then, a sudden gust of fragrant wind assailed his senses, and he rejoiced, “The moment is here!” Swiftly, he struck the gate three times with his wooden staff and cried aloud, “Peach Blossom!”

Whether her power could truly break Duke Zhou’s spell remains to be seen in the next chapter.

**Chapter Sixteen: A Battle of Wits in the Realm of Yin and Yang—The Two Sages Return to Their True Forms**

At the first whiff of the fragrant breeze, Peng Jian followed Peach Blossom’s instructions precisely: he struck the gate thrice with his wooden staff and cried aloud, *“Peach Blossom!”* Then, lifting his right foot, he kicked once—*crack!*—and the gate swung open. Inside, Peach Blossom’s corpse had just been hoisted up and carried out of the chamber. Duke Zhou, overjoyed, hurried after them, urging, “Quickly now, take her to be encoffined!”

But Peach Blossom’s soul, held captive by the malevolent *sha*, could not reenter her body. The moment Peng Jian struck the gate, the *sha* was startled into retreat, and her spirit rushed back into her flesh, her essence restored to its rightful place. With a sudden twist, she rose to her feet.

The Six Ding and Six Jia deities, seeing the immortal maiden return to the yang realm, vanished in a flash of light, ascending back to heaven. The servants and maidservants, witnessing Miss Peach Blossom rise so abruptly, shrieked in terror, scattering in all directions: *“Disaster! Disaster!”* Chaos erupted.

Peach Blossom’s almond eyes flew open. Spotting Duke Zhou nearby, her fury flared. *“Zhou Qian! I share no blood feud with you—why must you resort to such cruelty, bent on killing me? What now can you do to me?”*

Duke Zhou, stung by shame and rage, brandished his Heavenly Stem Sword and lunged at her. But Peach Blossom swiftly recited the counter-spell of the *gou-sha*, stepping back as she flung her sleeves toward him. With a peal of laughter, the *sha* reversed its course, striking Duke Zhou unawares. Though he wielded great power, he had no time to react—*“Ah!”*—his sword clattered to the ground, and he collapsed in a heap, his own *fa-ming* turned against him by the backlash of *sha*. Unaware of the transformation in her sleeves, the recoil of the *sha* struck him down, claiming his life instead.

Truly:

The flames one kindles burn oneself first;
He who harms others harms himself before.
Alas, how few in this world grasp this truth!

In an instant, Duke Zhou crumpled to the ground, his face purple, his lips cyan, his breath stilled. The entire household erupted in panic—men and women alike wailed in grief, crying, *"The lord must have been struck down by Ren Taohua’s sorcery! Do not let her escape! Seize her and take her to Marshal Wen’s estate!"*

Meanwhile, Tianxiang, seeing her father refuse her pleas, wept bitterly as she withdrew to her chambers. Taohua, hearing the clamor, let out a cold laugh. *"Zhou Qian sought to kill others, yet perished by his own hand—this is his just retribution! I stand here now. Let them try to take me."*

Just then, Peng Jian, having finished his tasks, rushed inside. Hearing the wailing, he was alarmed. In a few strides, he reached the hall, only to find the household in uproar. There stood Taohua, smiling faintly. He hurried forward, calling, *"Dear sister, everyone rejoices that you live—"* Before he could finish, the crowd swarmed around him, shouting, *"The lord has been slain by Taohua! Why waste words with her?"*

Peng Jian froze in shock. *"Is this true?"* The crowd pointed to the body. He looked up—Duke Zhou lay motionless. He pressed a hand to his mouth: no breath remained. With a cry, he broke into sobs. The others consoled him, *"He is gone. Weeping will not help—we must act!"*

Peng Jian stifled his tears. *"What can we do? He sought to harm others, then turned on his own daughter, only to be saved by the very one he wronged. Even then, he did not repent. Now fate has claimed him—who can he beg for mercy?"* Turning to Taohua, he knelt before her. *"Dear sister, show compassion once more! We will be forever in your debt!"*

Taohua helped him rise. *"Brother, do not humble yourself. They mean to take me to Marshal Wen. Let them summon him—I fear him not!"*

Peng Jian pleaded, *"They are fools. Sister, for my sake, spare him."* With that, he knelt again. The crowd followed, prostrating themselves, wailing, *"Lady Ren, if you revive the lord, we will be grateful for generations!"*

Taohua, moved by their pleas and eager to display her skill, smiled faintly. *"You no longer wish to seize me? Very well—for Brother Peng’s sake, I shall try."* The crowd kowtowed, begging, *"How may we save him?"*

Taohua’s smile turned cold. *"Do as before. Simply call out, ‘*Jiedao*!’—and he will revive."*

Peng Jian frowned. *"Why not call his name? Why ‘*Jiedao*’?"*

*"That is a celestial secret—how could you understand?"* Taohua replied. *"Go now!"*

"Once your master revives, you shall see my skill." Hearing this, Peng Jian asked no further. He shut the great doors as instructed and performed the ritual as before, crying out, "*Jiedao!*" At once, Lord Zhou’s wandering soul awakened and returned to his body. With a roll, he sat up upon the ground. Seeing Taohua, his eyes burned with hatred toward his foe. He leapt to his feet, seized the Heavenly Stem Sword, and roared, "Wretched fiend, stay your steps! How dare you harm me with the *huisha* technique? If I do not slay you today, I am no man!" He lunged forward, sword in hand.

Taohua swiftly drew a peach branch of boundless efficacy from her brocade pouch. With jadelike hands, she parried his blade and shouted, "Zhou Qian, ungrateful wretch! Do you forget the debt of your revived life? How dare you turn your strength against me?" Lord Zhou struck again. Taohua dodged and countered with her peach branch, one yin, one yang, locked in combat across the great hall.

Peng Jian cried out in alarm, "This is ill!" Unarmed, how could he intervene? He rushed to inform Miss Tianxiang, who fainted in terror upon hearing the news. She then hurried to the Ren household to deliver the report.

Meanwhile, Lord Zhou and Taohua fought from the great doors to the courtyard. Finding the space too cramped to unleash their powers, they both rose upon clouds into the midair, clashing fiercely in a dance of attack and retreat.

By then, Old Master Ren had arrived at the Zhou residence. Miss Tianxiang emerged to meet him and recounted the events, dissolving into sobs. Together, they raised their eyes to the heavens and watched.

They watched as the two, enveloped in radiant clouds, waged a bitter and fierce battle in midair, fighting ever farther away until they gradually vanished from sight. The cries of a child calling for their father rang in their ears, yet neither paid the slightest heed.

Later, when Old Master Ren and his wife saw their daughter restored to her divine seat, and beheld Tianxiang—whose appearance was identical to their own child—learning from Peng Jian how well they had gotten along, the elderly couple felt a surge of compassion. They instructed Peng Jian to propose that Tianxiang be recognized as their daughter. Upon hearing that her father had ascended to godhood, and recalling her early loss of her mother with no one to rely upon, Tianxiang was moved by the Rens’ kind offer. Remembering, too, her bond with Taohua, she promptly visited the Ren household to pay her respects to the elderly couple. They then welcomed her to stay as a companion.

As for Lord Zhou’s household affairs, they were entrusted to Peng Jian for management. But these are matters for later.

Meanwhile, Lord Zhou and Taohua fought with ever greater vigor, each unleashing their full powers, stirring winds to howl and thunder to roar. Their battle soon alarmed the Celestial Censor on patrol, who saw how fiercely they clashed, nearly reaching the Northern Gate of Heaven. He hastened to report to the True Martial Emperor of the Northern Heavens, the Dark Warrior of the North. The Emperor surveyed them with his wisdom-eye and already knew their origins. He dispatched his generals, the Tortoise and the Serpent, to bring the two before the divine throne.

The Tortoise and Serpent Generals received the divine decree. Each intercepted the two combatants amid the clouds, shouting loudly: "Cease your struggle! We bear the Celestial Emperor’s command—you are summoned to the Golden Palace! Disobey, and our might shall cast you from the heavens!" Hearing the summons of the Emperor, the pair had no choice but to sheathe their weapons. Together with the Tortoise and Serpent Generals, they approached the august presence and prostrated themselves, kneeling in reverence. After kowtowing, the Emperor issued his jade decree:

"You both possess foundational Dao cultivation—why do you harm one another? Zhou Qian, you are the transformed essence of the Ruyi Precept Blade, once the divination page in the Tushita Palace. Yet you failed to uphold purity, descending to the mortal realm in secret to reveal celestial secrets, thereby dragging Peach Blossom Girl into the world below. Ren Taohua is none other than the Ruyi Blade’s scabbard. Your natures are one—do not entertain other intentions! Today marks the time for your physical forms to ascend. Each of you shall be granted a golden elixir."

"Command them to swallow the elixirs," the Emperor continued. "Should either of you now harbor deviant intentions, this pill within your belly shall not dissolve within three quarters of an hour—even a body as indestructible as vajra will melt into pus and blood!"

With these words, he unfurled his Seven-Star Banner, wrapping the two within its folds and bearing them to the Wudang Mountains, where they were appointed as generals—Marshals Zhou and Peach. With a surge of divine radiance, the two marshals took their places on either side, standing to left and right. The Emperor then waved his Seven-Star Precious Banner seven times and exhaled a breath of primordial true qi toward the two marshals. At once, they withdrew their divine radiance, and their physical forms returned to their proper state.

That night, the Daoist master Ye of Wudang Mountain dreamed that the two marshals had entrusted him with letters for their families. Upon waking and ascending to the main hall, he saw that among the celestial generals now stood two divine marshals, their awe-inspiring radiance dazzling, their golden light resplendent. Startled, he noticed that beneath each of their feet lay a book, every detail clearly inscribed. He retrieved them but dared not open them. Immediately, he paid homage to the Emperor and the golden forms of the two marshals before hastening down the mountain under the cover of night, making his way to Chaoge City.

Upon locating the Zhou residence, he handed the letters to the gatekeeper and recounted the dream in which the two marshals had appeared. The gatekeeper hurried inside to inform Peng Jian. Peng Jian received the letters and, as courtesy demanded, provided the Daoist with a meal. He then accompanied the master to personally inform Elder Ren and his wife, as well as Miss Tianxiang. Each opened their letters to read the contents, which spoke only of the need for harmony between the two families and words of comfort. All were overjoyed, remarking that though the two had become gods, their spiritual efficacy remained undiminished.

Thereupon, they traveled together with Daoist Ye to Wudang Mountain to offer incense. First, they paid homage to the Emperor, then bowed before the two marshals. Upon closer inspection, the golden visages of the two marshals appeared no different from their living countenances. After the group had paid their respects, they presented Daoist Ye with a hundred taels of gold to cover the costs of incense and lamp oil for the two marshals’ worship. They then returned home, and the tale spread far and wide, astonishing all who heard it.

Before long, word reached the imperial court, and not a single civil or military official failed to come and pay their respects. Their devotion in worship was met with swift and resonant responses. Later generations, reflecting on this passage, composed a poem in testimony. The poem reads:

**First Poem:**
To act with heaven as witness in all affairs,
Never presume past causes can deceive.
Good and evil meet their just reward—
Three feet above, the gods watch all we leave.

**Second Poem:**
All things are ordained by heaven’s decree,
Schemes unravel when their time is done.
A heart insatiable as serpents swallowing elephants—
Cultivate intent like sages, wise and true.
No remedy exists for vain desire,
No wealth can purchase immortality.
The world’s harsh ways evoke both ancient and modern sighs—
Let others do their worst; my heart stands firm.
