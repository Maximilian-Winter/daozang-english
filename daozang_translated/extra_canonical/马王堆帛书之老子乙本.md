The *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I)* Laozi B Text, Preface to the Ancient Lost Book (P.87) **Dao Yuan (The Origin of the Dao/Way)**:
The Dao/Way is constant from its beginning, harmonizing with the Great Void.
The Great Void becomes one, and constancy makes it cease.
Damp and dreamy, it lacks clarity—no distinction between bright and dim.
Its essence subtly pervades, its vitality quietly unfolds (does not flourish).
Before anything existed, all things had no form.
Before anything took shape, the Great Dao/Way was named.
Heaven could not cover it, Earth could not bear it.
Small forms emerge to become small, great forms to become great.
Filling the realm within the Four Seas, yet still encompassing beyond.
In the shade, it does not rot; in the sun, it does not wither.
With one measure unchanging, it can adapt to all transformations (rules and movements).
Birds gain it and fly, fish gain it and swim, beasts gain it and run—
all things gain it and thrive, all affairs gain it and succeed.
All people use it, yet none know its name.
All people rely on it, yet none see its form.
One is its designation, the Void its dwelling,
its nature is plain, its application harmonious.
Thus, the Dao/Way of the highest is lofty yet unseen,
profound yet unfathomable.
Bright and clear, yet it cannot be named;
vast and great, yet it cannot be formed.
Standing alone, yet unpaired—
no thing can command it.
Heaven and Earth, yin and yang,
the Four Seasons, Sun and Moon,
stars, clouds, and **qi**—
all movements and transformations (rules and shifts),
those who follow the roots (primordial essence),
all draw life from it—
the Dao/Way does not make some gain less;
all return to it—
the Dao/Way does not make some gain more.
Firm yet not brittle, yielding yet not corruptible.
The subtle cannot reach it, the extreme cannot surpass it.
Thus, only the **sage** can perceive its form,
listen to its **sound**.
Knowing the reality of the Void,
they can then attain the Great Void.
Thus, they grasp the essence of Heaven and Earth,
unite with the harmonious yet remain distinct,
surround all yet are never full.
Those who embody this Dao/Way
are called **able to refine**.
The enlightened can perceive the utmost,
know what people cannot know—
people embody what they cannot attain.
This is called **perceiving the extreme and knowing the utmost**.
**Sage-kings** who practice this
make the world submit.
If the highest hate evil,
they govern with **rectitude** and the people are not confused.
If the highest embrace the Void below and remain tranquil,
the Dao/Way finds its proper order.
**Trust** can desire—
it can be the people’s command.
If the highest trust in governance,
all things will be universally **rectified**.
Allot to them their due,
and the myriad people will not contend.
Grant them their names,
and all things will naturally settle.
They do not **govern** with coercion,
nor **relax** with disorder.
Vast and great—
they do not **exhaust** its reach.
Profound and subtle—
they do not **seek** to grasp it.
Thus, they hold to the One yet do not transform.
The root of attaining the Dao/Way:
clutching the few to know the many.
The key to managing affairs:
grasping the proper to rectify the unusual.
Knowing the Great Ancient Dao/Way beforehand,
attaining its essence afterward.
Embrace the Dao/Way and hold fast to its measure—
the world can be unified.
Observe it in the Great Ancient Dao/Way,
and you will know its source.
Seek it in its beginning,
and you will attain its source.

**Dao Yuan** (The Origin of the Dao/Way) contains **four hundred and sixty-four** characters.

The *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I) – Laozi A Text and Others*: 130.
The *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I)* Laozi B Text (P.89) **Dharma/Virtue-Power Chapter**:
The highest **virtue/power** does not cling to **virtue/power**—
thus, it has **virtue/power**.
The lowest **virtue/power** does not lose **virtue/power**—
thus, it retains **virtue/power**.
The highest **virtue/power** acts yet does not act.
The highest **benevolence** acts yet does not act.
The highest **virtue/power** (in *Daoist* sense) acts yet has **virtue/power** in its action.
The highest **rites** act yet none respond—
then they flail their arms and cast it aside.
Thus, after losing the Dao/Way, **virtue/power** arises;
after losing **virtue/power**, **benevolence** follows;
after losing **benevolence**, **righteousness** follows;
after losing **righteousness**, **rites** follow.
**Rites**, though, are but the **thin veneer** of loyalty and trust,
and the beginning of chaos.
Knowledge beforehand is the **flowering** of the Dao/Way,
and the beginning of folly.
Thus, the **great man** abides in its **thickness** (substance),
not in its **thin veneer**,
dwelling in its reality, not its **flowering**.
Hence, they abandon that and take this.

The *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I) – Laozi A Text and Others*: 131.
The *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I)* Laozi B Text (P.89) **Dharma/Virtue-Power Chapter**:
Of old, those who attained the One—
Heaven gained the One to become clear,
Earth gained the One to become tranquil,
the **spirit** gained the One to become **alive/nimble**,
the **valley** gained the One to become full,
the **feudal lords and kings** gained the One to govern the world.
If they pushed it to its utmost,
Heaven would fear it might shatter if too clear,
Earth would fear it might erupt if too tranquil,
the **spirit** would fear it might falter if too **alive/nimble**,
the **valley** would fear it might dry up if too full,
the **feudal lords and kings** would fear their height might topple if too noble.
Thus, they must be noble yet humble as their root,
high yet low as their foundation.
Hence, the **feudal lords and kings** call themselves "lonely and childless" (without descendants),
for this is their humble root—
is it not? Thus, the utmost **principle** is **universal** (or "the utmost number is the vehicle").

Thus, one should not desire wealth that glitters like jade,
nor rigidity that clings like stone.

---
The **noble** who hears the Dao, strives diligently to practice it.
The **middle-ranking** who hears the Dao, holds it as if it exists, as if it does not.
The **lowly** who hears the Dao, laughs at it.
He who does not laugh is not worthy of the Dao.

Therefore, it is said:
To manifest the Dao is like obscuring it;
To advance the Dao is like retreating from it;
To level the Dao is like blending with it.

**Highest virtue** is like the **valley**,
Great brightness is like being sullied,
Extensive virtue is like insufficiency.
Establishing virtue is like stealing,
Authenticity is like returning to the uncarved block,
Great rectitude is like having corners,
Great skill is like clumsiness,
Great music is like silence,
Great art is like the unformed shape,
The Dao is nameless.

Only the Dao can begin well and complete well.

---
**Returning** is the movement of the Dao.
**Weakness** is the function of the Dao.
All things under Heaven arise from **Being**,
**Being** arises from **Non-Being**.

The Dao gives birth to **One**,
**One** gives birth to **Two**,
**Two** gives birth to **Three**,
**Three** gives birth to **all things**.
All things bear **yin** while embracing **yang**,
And through **harmonious qi**, they achieve balance.

What people most detest
Are the lonely, childless, and barren—
Yet rulers and lords claim these titles for themselves.
Some things are gained by giving,
And given by gaining.

What people are taught to do,
They in turn teach others.
He who dares to act without restraint
Will not meet a natural end—
I shall take him as my teacher.

---
The most **gentle** under Heaven
Overcomes the most **unyielding** under Heaven.
What emerges from **Being**
Returns to the **interstices**.

Thus, I know the benefit of action.

Unspoken teaching is most beneficial—
Few under Heaven can attain it.

---
Which is more cherished: name or body?
Which yields more: body or wealth?
Which brings greater harm: gain or loss?
Excessive love leads to great expenditure,
Excessive hoarding leads to great loss.
Thus, he who knows sufficiency is not humiliated,
He who knows when to stop is not in peril,
And he may endure long.

---
Great completion resembles deficiency,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness resembles emptiness,
Yet its use is unfailing.
Great straightness resembles crookedness,
Great eloquence resembles stammering,
Great skill resembles clumsiness,
Great abundance resembles scarcity.

**Quiet** overcomes **heat**,
**Stillness** overcomes **loudness**.
He who knows **clarity and tranquility**
May govern the world.

---
When the Dao prevails under Heaven,
Steeds are used for manure.
When the Dao declines,
Warhorses are bred in the wilds.

No crime is greater than excessive desire,
No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No fault is deeper than covetousness.
Thus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.

---
Without leaving his door,
He knows the world.
Without peering through the window,
He knows the **Way of Heaven**.
The farther one goes,
The less he knows.

Thus, the sage acts without moving,
Knows without seeing,
Accomplishes without doing.

---
The scholar’s learning increases daily,
The Daoist’s understanding diminishes daily.
Diminish, yet again diminish,
Until action is no longer action.
To seek to take the world,
One must first serve it—
Yet when the time comes to act,
It is no longer sufficient to take the world.

---
The sage’s heart is ever constant,
Using the hearts of a hundred families as his own.

The good man does good, and the wicked man also does good—
Thus he attains the good.
The trustworthy man is trusted, and the untrustworthy man is also trusted—
Thus he attains virtue/power.

The sage, dwelling in the world, is ever serene,
With a unified heart for all under Heaven.
All creatures pour their ears and eyes into him—
Yet the sage breathes them all away.

Life enters, death departs.
Of those who cling to life, thirteen perish;
Of those who embrace death, thirteen survive—
Yet the people persist in living,
Ever moving toward death’s thirteenfold path.
Why so?
Because they cling to life.

I have heard that those who hold life firmly
Fear not rhinoceros or tiger on the heights,
Nor arms in battle.
The rhinoceros may gore with its horn,
The tiger may strike with its claws,
The blade may cut—
Yet why?
Because they dwell in death’s domain.

The Dao gives birth, virtue/power nourishes it,
Form shapes it, and tools are completed.
Thus all things honor the Dao and revere virtue/power.
The Dao’s eminence, virtue/power’s worth—
None bestow them,
Yet they abide naturally.

The Dao gives birth, nourishes, grows, matures, shelters, protects, and rears.
It gives birth yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Grows yet does not rule—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue/power.

Under Heaven there is a beginning—
The mother of all things.
Having obtained the mother,
One knows her children.
Having known the children,
One returns to guard the mother—
And never meets peril.
Close the orifices, shut the gates,
And one never labors to the end of life.
Open the orifices, attend to affairs,
And one never meets obstacles to the end of life.
Seeing the small is clarity,
Holding to softness is strength.
Using its brilliance, yet returning to its clarity—
To abandon oneself to calamity
Is called the constant way.

If I were to walk the Great Dao,
Only reverence would I fear.

The Great Dao is most smooth,
Yet the people love strife.
Morning rituals are neglected,
Fields lie fallow,
Granaries are empty;
They wear ornate robes,
Bear sharp swords,
Feast sumptuously while hoarding wealth—
This is called *excessive* [corruption].
Excessive [corruption] is not the Dao.

Those who build well are unshaken,
Those who embrace well are not cast off.
Their descendants continue in sacrifice without ceasing.

Cultivate virtue/power in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power is abundant.
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue/power grows strong.
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes flourishing.
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal.

Observe oneself to understand the self,
Observe the family to understand the family,
Observe the state to understand the state,
Observe the world to understand the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Those rich in virtue/power are like the unborn babe.
Scorpions, centipedes, snakes do not sting,
Fierce birds and wild beasts do not clutch—
Their bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grasp is firm.
They do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—
This is the utmost of essence.
They wail all day yet do not grow hoarse—
This is the utmost of harmony.
Knowing harmony is called constancy,
Knowing constancy is called clarity,
Increasing life is called auspicious,
The will directing qi is called strength.

When things reach their peak, they grow old—
This is called *not the Dao*.
Not the Dao brings early decay.

The wise do not speak; those who speak do not know the Dao.

Block its openings, close its doors,
Harmonize its brightness, blend with its dust,
Dull its sharpness and untangle its disputes—
This is called *the unity of the mysterious*.

Thus it cannot be approached with familiarity,
Nor can it be pushed away with coldness;
It cannot be exploited for gain,
Nor can it be harmed by enmity;
It cannot be prized for nobility,
Nor can it be belittled for lowliness.
Thus it is held in highest esteem by the world.

How do I know this is so? By this.

The world abounds with taboos and prohibitions,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
The people abound with sharp tools,
Yet the state and home grow ever more chaotic.
When clever devices proliferate,
The people’s confusion grows thick.
When laws and regulations multiply,
Thieves and bandits abound.

Therefore the words of the *sage* say:
I act for the people, yet they transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people grow upright;
I tend to affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;
I desire yet do not desire, yet the people return to simplicity.

When governance is gentle and compassionate,
The people are simple and earnest.
When governance is sharp and scrutinizing,
The people grow weary and depleted.
Where fortune lies hidden, who knows its limits?
Governance that is too rigid becomes perverse,
Goodness that is too excessive becomes unnatural—
The people’s bewilderment has long endured.

Thus it is square yet not rigid,
Modest yet not mean,
True yet not harsh,
Bright yet not dazzling.

To govern the people and serve Heaven,
Nothing surpasses *frugality*.

It is only through *frugality* that one may early serve [Heaven].

Early service is to say [the accumulation of] **virtue/power**.

[The accumulation of] **virtue/power** that is too heavy cannot be achieved,
Cannot be achieved, then one cannot know its limits.
Cannot know its limits, then one may have a state.
A state’s foundation, one may endure long.

This is to say [the attainment of] **deep-rooted and firmly established** Dao,
The Way of long life and enduring vision.

*Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Old Master Laozi (Version A and B): 152. Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Laozi Version B, P.91*

To govern a great state as one cooks a small fish,
To establish the Dao/Way under Heaven,
Its spirits do not become numinous.
Not because its spirits do not become numinous,
But because its numinous spirits do not harm the people.
Not because its numinous spirits do not harm the people,
For even the **sage** does not harm them.

Thus, the two do not harm each other,
Hence **virtue/power** returns and exchanges are made.

---
*Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Old Master Laozi (Version A and B): 153. Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Laozi Version B, P.91*

A great state is the **lowly** one, the **receptive** (牝) of Heaven and Earth. It is the **gathering place** (交) of all under Heaven. The **receptive** (牝) ever, by its stillness, overcomes the **assertive** (牡).

Because of its stillness, it is fitting to be lowly. Thus, when a great state is lowly to small states, it takes them; when a small state is lowly to great states, it is taken by them. Hence, sometimes it is lowly and takes, sometimes it is taken while remaining lowly.

Thus, the great state does not merely wish to **amass** (并畜) people, and the small state does not merely wish to **submit** (入事) to others. When both attain their desires, the greater should still act lowly.

The Dao/Way is the **source** (注) of all things, the **treasure** (宝) of the virtuous, and the **refuge** (所保) of the unvirtuous. Fine words can be used to **trade** (市), noble actions can be **added** (加) to others. If people are not virtuous, how could they be **abandoned** (弃)?

Therefore, when establishing the Son of Heaven, appointing the Three Ministers (三卿), even if one has a **shared** (共) jade tablet to precede four horses, it is better than sitting and offering this instead.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao/Way in such esteem? Not to **obtain** what is sought, nor to **avoid** guilt by pardoning.

Thus, this Dao/Way is most precious for all under Heaven.

**Action** (為) is **matter** (事) and **flavor** (味). Great or small, many or few—**respond** to resentment with **virtue/power** (德). **Plotting** (图) difficulties is easier than **plotting** greatness, and **plotting** greatness is easier than **plotting** subtleties. The difficulty of governing all under Heaven lies in its ease, and the greatness of governing all under Heaven lies in its subtlety. Therefore, the sage never **plots** greatness, and thus can achieve it.

The sage finds it difficult to govern, hence he **finally** achieves difficulty.

When things are at ease, they are easily maintained; when their signs are not yet apparent, they are easily **planned** (谋); when they are brittle, they are easily **judged** (判); when they are subtle, they are easily **dispersed** (散). Begin **action** (為) when things are not yet formed, and govern when things are not yet in disorder.

A tree with a trunk thick enough to encircle with both arms begins as a **sprout** (毫末). A nine-tiered (九成) tower begins with a **clod of earth** (蔂土). A height of ten thousand feet begins at the **foundation** (足下).

Those who **act** (為) are doomed to **fail** (敗), and those who **grasp** (执) are doomed to **lose** (失). Therefore, the sage **acts** but does not **fail**, **grasps** but does not **lose**.

When the people engage in affairs, they are always prone to **fail** upon completion. Therefore it is said:

*"Be cautious at the **end** (終) as you are at the **beginning** (始), and affairs will be **ruined** (敗)."*

Thus, the sage **desires** what others do not **desire**, and does not value **difficult-to-obtain goods** (难得之货); he **learns** what others do not **learn**, and **repeats** the mistakes of the multitude.

He can **assist** the natural unfolding of all things, yet does not **dare** to act.

The ancients who **established** the Dao/Way did not do so to **enlighten** the people, but rather to **delude** them.

The people are difficult to govern because of their **wisdom** (智). Thus, knowing (以知) a state with **wisdom** is the **ruin** (贼) of the state; knowing (以不知) a state without **wisdom** is the **virtue/power** (德) of the state.

Ever knowing these two principles is the **standard** (稽式). Ever knowing the standard is to speak of **mysterious virtue/power** (玄德).

**Mysterious virtue/power** is profound and distant, **contrary** (反) to things, yet **reaches** the **great harmony** (大顺).

The rivers and seas are able to be the rulers of all the valleys (谷),
because they **are good at yielding** to what is below them (以其善下之也).
Thus, they can be the rulers of all the valleys (谷).

Therefore, the **sages** (圣) who wish to **elevate** the people (欲上民),
must **lower their words** to them (必以其言下之);
those who wish to **lead** the people (欲先民),
must **follow with their bodies** (必以其身后之).

Hence, though they **reside above** (居上),
the people do not **hold them in contempt** (弗重);
though they **stand before** (居前),
the people are not **harmed** (弗害).

The world all **delights in pushing them forward** (乐推) yet does not **weary of them** (弗厌),
not because they **contend** (争) with it!
Thus, **heaven and earth** (天下) and all things (莫能) cannot **contend with them** (与争).

Therefore, in a **small state with few people** (小国寡民),
let there be **ten thousand** (十百) **tools** (人器) yet **not employ them** (而勿用),
so that the people **hold death in reverence** (重死) and **avoid migration** (远徙).

There are **boats and chariots** (周舟车) for their **use** (所乘),
and **armor and weapons** (甲兵) **displayed** (所陈).
Yet let the people **return to knotting cords** (复结绳) for their **practical needs** (而用之).

Let them **find their food sweet** (甘其食),
**their clothing fine** (美其服),
**their customs delightful** (乐其俗),
and **their dwellings secure** (安其居).

Neighboring states lie in view of one another,
yet the barking of dogs is all that passes between them—
the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

**True words are not beautiful**; beautiful words are not true.
The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.
The virtuous do not hoard; the hoarders are not virtuous.

The **Dao/Way** of the **sage** accumulates—
giving to others, yet **virtue/power** only grows;
taking from others, yet **virtue/power** only increases.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** of **heaven** benefits without harming;
the **Dao/Way** of humanity acts without contending.

The world **all** calls me great,
great yet not resembling.
Because I do not resemble,
only then can I be great.
If I were to resemble,
long ago I would have been insignificant.

I always possess three **treasures**,
hold them and **treasure** them:
one is **Daoist compassion** (慈),
the second is **Daoist frugality** (俭),
the third is **not daring to act first under heaven**.

**Daoist compassion** (慈) enables **virtue/power** (勇);
**Daoist frugality** (俭) enables daring, **therefore** abundance;
**not daring to act first under heaven** enables completion of the task and **leadership** (成器长).

Now if one abandons **Daoist compassion** (慈) and instead seeks **virtue/power** (勇),
abandons **Daoist frugality** (俭) and instead seeks abundance,
abandons **the Way of yielding** (后) and instead acts first,
then one will perish.

**Daoist compassion** (慈),
when waging **war** (战), brings **victory** (胜);
when defending, brings **steadfastness** (固).
**Heaven** will establish it—
as if **Daoist compassion** (慈) were its **boundary/wall** (垣).

Thus, those skilled in **Daoist governance** (为士) are not belligerent;
those skilled in **war** (战) do not grow angry;
those skilled in **victory** (胜) over enemies do not contend;
those skilled in **using people** (用人) place them below themselves.

This is called **the Way of non-contention** (不争之德).
This is called **using people** (用人);
this is called **harmonizing with Heaven** (配天),
the ultimate standard of antiquity.

When wielding arms, there is a saying:
*"I dare not take the offensive but only defend,
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."*

This is called **moving without moving** (行行),
**brandishing arms** (攘臂),
**grasping weapons** (执兵),
yet **not engaging the enemy** (乃敌).
**Disaster is greatest when facing the enemy** (祸莫大于敌).
When the enemy is near, **my treasure is lost** (亡吾宝矣).
Thus, when armies confront each other in equal strength,
**the one who laments will prevail** (哀者胜矣).

My words are easy to know, easy to follow;
yet the world cannot know them, cannot follow them.
Words have their **roots** (宗),
affairs have their **lords** (君).
Only because **they do not know** (知),
they do not know me.
The few who know make me **precious** (贵矣).
Thus, the **Sage** wears coarse cloth while **embracing jade** (被褐怀玉).

To know what is unknown—
this is **exalted** (尚矣).

To know what one does not know—this is **illness** (病矣).
Thus, the **Sage** does not **suffer** (病) because **they treat illness as illness** (以其病病也), and so they do not suffer.

---

When the people do not fear what is **awful** (畏),
then **great awe** (大畏) will surely come.
Do not **despise** (狎) where you dwell,
do not **satiate** (厌) what sustains you.
Only because they do not **satiate** (厌),
they are not **satiated** (厌).
Thus, the **Sage** knows themselves yet does not **boast** (自见),
loves themselves yet does not **exalt** (自贵).
Therefore, they abandon that and embrace this.

---

To dare boldly is to slay,
to dare not to dare is to **preserve** (活).
These two—one brings **benefit**, one brings **harm**.
What the **Heavenly** (天) **abhors** (恶), who knows its reason?
The **Way of Heaven**—
it does not **wage war** (战) yet **excellently conquers** (善胜),
it does not **speak** (言) yet **excellently responds** (善应),
it does not **summon** (召) yet **comes of its own accord** (自来),
**plain** (坦) yet **excellently strategizes** (善谋).
**Heaven’s net** (网) is **vast** (罔罔),
**spread wide yet loses none**.

---

If the people **constantly** do not fear death,
how can one **terrify** (惧) them?
If one makes the people **constantly** fear death,
then those who act **strangely** (奇) [I] **seize and kill** (得而杀之),
who then would dare?
If the people **constantly** must fear death,
then there will always be those who **execute** (司杀者).
For those who **replace the executioner** to kill—
this is to **replace the master carpenter** to **hew** (斲).
To **replace the master carpenter** to hew—
few would not **injure their hands**.

When the people are hungry,
it is because their means of taking food are excessive,
thus they hunger.

When the myriad surnames are not governed,
it is because their rulers take for themselves,
thus they are not governed.

When the people lightly regard death,
it is because their desire for life is excessive,
thus they lightly regard death.

He who constantly takes for himself in life—
this is to esteem life as virtue and honor.

The way of life for man is soft and weak,
yet in death it is firm and strong.
The way of life for all things—grass and wood—
is soft and brittle,
yet in death they wither and dry.

Thus it is said:
**"Firm and strong are the companions of death;
soft and weak are the companions of life."**

If one relies on strength in battle, one will not prevail;
if wood is strong, it will be cracked.
Thus, strength dwells below,
while softness and weakness dwell above.

The Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow:
the high it presses down,
the low it lifts up,
the overabundant it diminishes,
the insufficient it supplements.
Thus the Dao/Way of the world is:
to diminish the overabundant and benefit the insufficient;
the Dao/Way of man is:
to diminish the insufficient and hoard the overabundant.

Who then can hoard the overabundant
and yet offer it to Heaven?
Only those who possess the Dao/Way.

Therefore the Sage acts yet does not hoard,
achieves yet does not dwell upon it.
Thus it is that he does not wish to be seen as virtuous.

In the world, nothing is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing can overcome the firm and strong as water does.
It is because water has no equal in yielding.

Water’s victory over the hard,
weakness’s victory over the strong—
the world knows this yet cannot emulate it.

Therefore the Sage’s words say:
"To bear the reproach of a state,
this is called the guardian of its soil and grain.
To bear the inauspiciousness of a state,
this is called the sovereign of the world."

Right speech is like returning to its source.
*[And]* great harmony with resentment,
there must be excess resentment—
how can this be considered good?

Thus the Sage holds the left [side of] the covenant
yet does not blame others for it.
Therefore there is virtue in keeping the covenant,
virtue in fulfilling it.
Heaven’s Dao/Way is close,
constantly favoring those of good virtue.

The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao/Way.
The name that can be named is not the constant name.
The name is the origin of all things.
That which has a name is the mother of all things.
Thus, always desiring to observe its subtlety,
always desiring to observe its manifestations.
Both arise from the same source, though named differently yet share the same essence.
Mysterious beyond measure, the gateway to all marvels.

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty,
ugly is already present.
When all know goodness, evil is already there.
Being and non-being produce each other,
difficulty and ease define each other,
long and short shape each other,
high and low fill each other,
sound and voice harmonize each other,
before and after follow each other—
this is the constant way.
Therefore the Sage acts without doing,
teaches without speaking.
Things arise yet he does not claim them as his own,
acts yet does not rely on them,
succeeds yet does not dwell upon it.
It is precisely because he does not dwell upon it
that he never loses it.

Do not exalt the virtuous,
and the people will not compete.
Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods,
and the people will not steal.
Do not display what is desirable,
and the people will not be confused.
Thus the Sage’s governance:
empties their minds, fills their bellies,
weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.
Always let the people know desire—
yet if they dare not act against it, governance fails.

The Dao/Way is boundless,
yet its use is inexhaustible.
Deep and vast, it seems the ancestor of all things.
It blunts the sharp, untangles the tangled,
softens the bright, harmonizes the dusty.
Profound and vast, it seems to exist yet not.
I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the Sovereign like an image.

Heaven and Earth are not kind;
they treat all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not kind;
he treats the people as straw dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth—
what is their likeness?
Empty yet not bent,
moving yet ever more abundant.
Much hearing leads to exhaustion;
better to guard the inner essence.

---

The Dao/Way of the Mysterious Feminine never dies—
it is called the *Dark Mother*.
The gate of the Dark Mother—
that is the root of Heaven and Earth.
Its breath seems to exist—
use it without exhaustion.

Heaven endures, Earth persists.
The reason Heaven and Earth endure so long
is that they do not act for themselves—
thus they endure forever.
Therefore, the Sage withdraws his self, yet leads;
sets himself aside, yet stands foremost;
does not cling to his own—
thus his own is fulfilled.

The highest virtue is like water.

Water excels in benefiting all things yet does not contend—
it dwells where people despise.
Thus it nears the Dao/Way.

Dwelling, it chooses the lowly ground;
its heart, the depths;
its giving, the natural;
its speech, truthfulness;
its governance, skillful order;
its actions, timely;
its movement, measured.
Only by not contending does it attain its superiority.

---
To hold and fill is not as good as stopping in time.
To grasp and clutch is not as good as enduring.
Gold and jade filling the halls—
none can guard them.
Wealth and arrogance bring ruin.
To complete a task and withdraw—
this is the Dao/Way of Heaven.

To wear the vital essence and embrace unity—
can one not remain undivided?
To gather qi into supreme softness—
can one not return to infantile purity?
To polish the Mysterious Mirror—
can one not be without blemish?
To love the people and nourish the state—
can one not act without knowing?
To open and close the Heavenly Gate—
can one not be receptive?
To be clear and all-encompassing—
can one not act without knowing?
To give birth and nurture—
to give birth yet not possess,
to grow yet not control—
this is called the Mysterious Virtue.

Thirty spokes converge at a single hub,
yet it is the emptiness that gives the wheel its use.
Mold clay into vessels,
yet it is the emptiness that gives them their use.
Carve doors and windows,
yet it is the emptiness that gives the room its use.
Thus, what is filled is used for advantage,
what is empty is used for function.

The five colors blind the eyes,
hunting in the wild drives the heart to madness,
rare treasures hinder one’s conduct.
The five tastes dull the palate,
the five tones deaf the ears.
Therefore, the **sage** in governing does
what benefits the body, not what pleases the eyes.
Thus, he discards that and takes this.

To cherish and be humiliated as if struck by fear—
how is this called cherishing and being humiliated as if struck by fear?
Cherishing is a lowly thing;
to gain it is like being struck by fear,
to lose it is like being struck by fear—
this is called cherishing and being humiliated as if struck by fear.

How is this called valuing great calamity as if it were the body?
It is because of my body that I have great calamity.
When I have no body,
what calamity can there be?
Therefore, to value the body above all else in the world,
one can **entrust** the world;
to love the body above all else in the world,
one can **rely upon** the world.

Look at it yet cannot see—
this is called **subtle**.
Listen to it yet cannot hear—
this is called **rare**.
Grasp at it yet cannot attain—
this is called **plain**.
These three cannot be defined by reasoning,
so I blend them into one.
One: its highest aspect is not erroneous,
its lowest aspect is not slighted.

Seeking and inquiring cannot be named—
it returns to the **essence**.
This is called **the form of forms**,
**the image of images**.
This is called **the dim and hazy**.
Follow it and you do not see its back,
meet it and you do not see its head.
Hold to the **Dao/Way** of today
to govern the **possessions** of today.
To know the ancient beginnings—
this is called **the record of the Dao/Way**.

The ancients who **practiced the Dao/Way**—
their **subtle** and **mysterious** virtue was profound and far-reaching,
deep and beyond comprehension.
Because it was beyond comprehension,
they strenuously described it as follows:
Like crossing water in winter, cautious and alert,
like fearing on all sides, wary and watchful,
like treating a guest with reverence, solemn and respectful,
like melting ice, clear and dissolving,
like returning to simplicity, pure and unadorned,
like settling mud, still and turbid,
like flowing in valleys, muddy yet yielding.
Turbid yet still, it gradually clears.
Disturbed yet settled, it gradually comes to life.
To preserve this **Dao/Way**
is to never seek fullness—
thus one can be **worn out** yet never complete.

When **emptiness** reaches its utmost,
one guards **stillness** with vigilance.
All things arise together,
and I observe their return.
The **vital essences** of Heaven and Earth
each return to their own roots.
This is called **stillness**.
**Stillness** is called **returning to the vital essence**.
Returning to the vital essence is called **constancy**.
Knowing **constancy** is called **clarity**.
Not knowing **constancy** is **recklessness**,
and **recklessness** brings disaster.
Knowing **constancy**, one is **tolerant**—
**tolerance** becomes **impartiality**,
**impartiality** becomes **kingly**,
**kingly** becomes **heavenly**,
**heavenly** becomes **Dao/Way**,
**Dao/Way** becomes **itself**.
Thus, one’s life is never in peril.

The greatest is known yet has **possessions**;
the next is loved for its reputation;
the next is feared;
the lowest is despised.
Trust is insufficient,
and without trust there is no trustworthiness.
It is like valuing words.
When tasks are accomplished,
the people say, “It happened naturally.”

Therefore, when the **Great Dao/Way** is abandoned,
where do **virtue/power** and **benevolence/rightness** arise?
When **wisdom** emerges,
where does **great deception** arise?
When the six relationships are discordant,
where do **filial piety** and **compassion** arise?

When a state is in **turmoil and confusion**,
where do **loyal ministers** arise?

Thus, when the **Sage** abandons **wisdom**,
the people benefit a hundredfold.
When **virtue/power** and **benevolence/rightness** are discarded,
the people return to **filial piety** and **compassion**.
When **artifice** and **profit** are forsaken,
the **lowly** are held in esteem.
These three principles—
though insufficient as doctrine—
are thus made to have their place.

Seeing **unadorned simplicity** and embracing **primordial purity**,
with few **private desires** and scant **cravings**.

Abandon **learning** and **worry**.

How far apart are **approval** and **reproach**?
How different are **beauty** and **evil**?
That which people **fear**,
one must also not fail to **fear**.

Dazed and bewildered—
how vast and boundless it is!
The multitude **revels**,
feasting as if at a grand banquet,
ascending platforms in spring.

I alone am **serene and unassuming**,
like an infant before it cries.
Layered and obscured—
it seems to have a destination.

The multitude all have **excess**,
while my **simple-hearted** mind
is **pure and uncluttered**.

The **common folk** are **bright and clear**,
yet I alone seem **confused**.
The **common folk** are **sharp and discerning**,
yet I alone am **grieving and sorrowful**.

Floating like the sea,
dazed as if at rest.
The multitude all have **some means**,
while I alone am **obstinate and coarse**.

I wish to differ from others,
yet **revere the nourishing Mother**.

The **virtue/power** of the **Great One**—
only the **Dao/Way** follows it.
The **Dao/Way’s** essence—
only **dazed** and **boundless**.
Boundless and dazed—
within it lies **form**.
Dazed and boundless—
within it lies **substance**.
**Profound** and **obscure**—
within it lies **essence**.
Its essence is **most true**,
within it lies **trust**.
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade—
it conforms to the **Great Parent**.

How do I know the **Great Parent** is so?
Thus.

The **cook** does not stand.

He who **shows himself** does not **shine**,
he who **praises himself** is not **clear**.

He who **boasts of his own merits** achieves **virtue/power**,
yet he who **vaunts himself** does not **endure**.

In the **Dao/Way**, it is said:
*"**Excessive food**, **superfluous actions**."*

Some may **despise** this,
so those with **desires** do not **abide** by it.

**Flexible** is **whole**,
**crooked** is **straight**,
**lowly** is **filled**,
**worn** is **renewed**.

**Few** is **gain**,
**many** is **confusion**.

Thus, the **sage** holds to **One**,
to **shepherd** the world.

He does not **show himself**, so he **shines**,
he does not **praise himself**, so he is **clear**.
He does not **boast of his own merits**, so he has **virtue/power**,
he does not **vaunt himself**, so he can **endure**.

Only he who does not **contend**,
can **none** **contend** with him.

Of old, those who spoke of **"**Flexible** is **whole**"**—how few their words were!
Indeed, **whole** returns to it.

**Hopeful speech** comes from **naturalness**.

「轻风不终朝，暴雨不终日。
孰为此？天地，而弗能久，又况于人乎？
故从事而道者同于道，得者同于德，失者同于失。
同于德者，道亦得之；同于失者，道亦失之。

有物混成，先天地生。
寂寥独立，不改，可以为天下母。
吾未知其名，字之曰**Dao/Way**。
吾强为之名曰大。
大曰**逝**，逝曰远，远曰反。
**Dao/Way**大，天大，地大，王亦大。
天下有四大，而王居一焉。
人法地，地法天，天法**Dao/Way**，**Dao/Way**法自然。

重为轻根，静为躁君。
是以君子终日行，不远其辎重，虽有环馆，燕处则昭若。
若何万乘之王而以身轻于天下？
轻则失本，躁则失君。

善行者达，善言者谪，善数者不用筹策。
善闭者关钥而不可启，善结者约而不可解。
是以圣人恒善救人，而弃人，物弃财，是谓曳明。
故善人，善人之师；不善人，善人之资也。
不贵其师，不爱其资，虽智大迷。
是谓妙要。

知其雄，守其雌，为天下谷。
为天下谷，恒德乃足。
恒德乃足，复归于朴。
知其白，守其黑，为天下式。
为天下式，恒德不忒。
恒德不忒，复归于极。
朴散则为器，圣人用则为官长。
夫大制割。

将欲取天下而为之，吾见其弗得已。
夫天下，神器也，非可为者也。
为之者败之，执之者失之。
物或行或随，或热或寒，或培或堕。
是以圣人去甚，去大，去奢。

以**Dao/Way**佐人主，不以兵强于天下。
其事好还，师之所处，荆棘生之。
善者果而已矣，毋以取强焉。
果而勿骄，果而勿矜，果而勿伐，果而勿得已居，是谓果而强。
物壮而老，谓之不**Dao/Way**，不**Dao/Way**早已。」

Weapons are an inauspicious instrument.
Men may detest them, yet those with desires cannot refrain from wielding them.

The noble man, when at rest, honors the left;
when wielding arms, honors the right.
Thus, weapons are not the instrument of the noble man.

Weapons are an inauspicious instrument—
when used, sharpness is paramount, not adornment.
To adorn them is to delight in killing.
He who delights in killing cannot prevail in the world.

Therefore, for joyous rites, the left is honored;
for funeral rites, the right is honored.
Thus, the general of the left wing takes his place on the left,
while the general of the right wing takes his place on the right—
this is to treat them with funeral rites.

When many are slain, establish them with sorrowful mourning;
when victorious, treat them with funeral rites.

The Dao/Way is nameless,
yet when simplicity is small, the world dares not serve it.

If lords and kings can guard it,
all things will willingly submit themselves.

Heaven and Earth unite,
and all things flourish with sweet dew.

The people do not command it,
yet they naturally align themselves.

Once institutions are established, names are given;
when names are given, one must know when to stop—
to know when to stop is to avoid ruin.

Compare the Dao/Way in the world
to a tiny valley among great rivers and seas.

The noble man, when he can make all things submit yet does not lord over them,
is ever desiring, and thus may be called *small*.
When he makes all things submit yet does not lord over them,
he may be called *great*.
Thus, the sage’s ability to accomplish greatness
lies in his not claiming greatness,
and so he can accomplish greatness.

Hold to the great image,
and the world will follow.
Follow without harm,
and the world will be at peace and great.

Joy and indulgence—
when guests depart, they are stopped.

Thus, when the Dao/Way speaks,
it says:
*"Its taste is subtle,
yet not visible when seen.
Its sound is faint,
yet not heard when listened to.
Its use is inexhaustible."*

When you wish to gather it,
you must first let it disperse.
When you wish to weaken it,
you must first let it grow strong.
When you wish to take it away,
you must first give it.
When you wish to seize it,
you must first yield it.
This is called *subtle efficacy*.

The soft overcomes the strong.
The fish cannot escape the deep,
nor the sharpest tools reveal their danger to the world.

The Dao/Way is nameless;
if lords and kings can guard it,
all things will naturally transform.

When transformed yet inclined to act,
I will restrain them with the simplicity of its name.
Restrained by the simplicity of its name,
they will not be humiliated.
Not humiliated, they will remain tranquil,
and Heaven and Earth will naturally restore themselves.

*Dao/Way* in **246** words.
