**The Supreme Northern Dipper Twenty-Eighth Chapter Sutra**

Once, Emperor Ming of Han wandered upon Mount Zhongnan, where he beheld a woman clad in plain white robes, her hair unbound and feet bare, seated motionless upon a stone.

The Emperor said: "I am the sovereign of all under Heaven. Who are you, that you show no proper reverence in my presence?"

The woman replied: "I am a servant of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, a star official who governs the registers of the Seven Primordials of the Northern Pole. Who are *you*, to demand my obeisance?"

The Emperor’s countenance paled, and he bowed deeply in apology: "I am the lord of the myriad people, yet I have never encountered a true immortal. Today, by fortune, I meet you. I bow twice in reverence, blessed to gaze upon the true and sagely visage of your compassion. This is no mere coincidence of this life, but a karmic bond from past existences.

I humbly beseech the Primordial Lord to take pity and transmit the true instructions, that I may govern body, life, state, and household. Let my ministers each receive and uphold them. I implore the Primordial Lord not to withhold the treasure of the great abyss, but to raise once more the thunderous voice. I shall proclaim this throughout the realm, that it may flow across mountains and rivers, and all the people may share in this encounter with the grand model."

He bowed twice more, then rose and stepped forward. As he gazed, he saw clouds and mist crowning her head, her feet enveloped in radiant hues, auspicious qi rising five feet into the air. The Seven Sages dwelled above, with two officials standing behind.

The Primordial Lord said: "I am not one sage, but seven. The two star officials record the good and evil of humanity, known as the Stars of Left Assistant and Right Supporter."

The Emperor asked: "What are the names of the Seven Stars?"

The Primordial Lord replied: "The first is Greedy Wolf, the second is Great Gate, the third is Store of Emolument, the fourth is Literary Curve, the fifth is Upright Integrity, the sixth is Martial Curve, and the seventh is Breaking Army."

**Ritual Invocation of the Seven Perfected Sages’ Names**

With sincere heart, I take refuge and pay homage:
The Great Compassionate, Great Vowed, Great Sage, Great Merciful Seven Primordial Star Lords of the Central Northern Dipper,
The High Perfected of the Central Northern Dipper’s Arrayed Sages,
The Seven Official Lords who extend life, preserve destiny, deliver from calamity, dispel misfortune, avert decline, scatter woes, and augment fate,
The Former Sage Emperor Ming of Han, Initiator of this Sutra,
The Celestial Capital’s Original Destiny of My Life,
I humbly beseech your vast compassion to deign to witness this recitation.

---

**Chapter One: The Star Lord Greedy Wolf**

At that time, the Primordial Lord of the Great Dao spoke to the sagely and enlightened Emperor: "If you now seek my true Dao to govern body, life, state, and household, cultivate equanimity in your heart and walk the path with uprightness. Heaven and Earth will bear witness, the sun and moon will take pity, the stars will aid and protect, ghosts and spirits will retreat afar, loyal ministers will assist the sovereign, and the people will know no affliction. The four seas and eight directions will resound with songs of joy and come to pay homage. The myriad people will live without strife, life will be prolonged, years will be added to your fate, the hundred passages will flow smoothly, and the Emperor’s mandate will endure forever, the Dao and qi naturally harmonious."

---

**Chapter Two: The Star Lord Great Gate**

The Primordial Lord spoke to the sagely Emperor: "If you now seek my Dao and methods to govern the body, within the twelve hours of the day, do not lose the true Dao, and your life’s fate will be extended."

The Primordial Lord said: "If you abide by the Dao, my life is in my own hands, not in Heaven’s. If you lose the Dao, the myriad stars will not protect you, a hundred misfortunes will arise in competition, and your lifespan will not be long, with calamities arising naturally."

---

**Chapter Three: The Star Lord Store of Emolument**

The Primordial Lord spoke to the sagely Emperor: "If you now seek my Dao, cast aside wealth and sensuality, eliminate the attachments of self and others, greed and anger. Honor superiors and care for inferiors. Let wisdom and faith be your foundation, propriety and righteousness your priority. Refrain from harming life, and cease indulging in pleasure."

The Emperor replied: "I seek the Dao and its methods to govern household and self, and others will follow suit. Let the people know no vexation, heed no false words, and ensure that ruler and ministers remain unconfused. Body will flourish, the Dao will align, and the myriad people will naturally follow."

---

**Chapter Four: The Star Lord Literary Curve**

The Primordial Lord spoke to the sagely Emperor: "If you now seek my true Dao, this is no small affinity. Through kalpas past, you have followed the heavens above, and only today do you encounter us, the assembly of Star Lords. Excellent, excellent!

For the myriad people of later generations, the benefits of goodness will be boundless. The world’s abundance or scarcity, suffering or joy, are not decreed by the celestial bureaus. They are self-created by the human heart, not ordained by Heaven and Earth. You must guard against licentiousness and avoid disordered sensuality. Then the union of yin and yang will be correct, the Dao’s radiance will shine, and Heaven and Earth will naturally harmonize."

---

**Chapter Five: The Star Lord Upright Integrity**

The Primordial Lord spoke to the sagely Emperor: "If one seeks my true Dao, throughout the twelve hours of the day, let the Azure Dragon on the left and the White Tiger on the right each occupy their proper directions. Let the dragon’s roar summon clouds, and the tiger’s howl stir the wind. Press the tongue against the upper palate, click the teeth forty-nine times, and rub the numinous with both hands. Then let the Red Ox plow the earth nine times. The Vermilion Bird will respond in front, the Dark Warrior behind, the Six Dings and Six Jias at my left and right, and the Heavenly Ding warriors and celestial soldiers before and behind me. Alone, I ride the White Dragon, and yellow qi penetrates my crown gate. My complexion will not age, my hair will not wither, my teeth will regrow when fallen. Above, I ascend to the Golden Gates; below, I cover Kunlun. My life will be extended, ruler and ministers will not fall into chaos, the myriad people will know no strife, the Dao’s radiance will shine, and Heaven and Earth will naturally harmonize."

---

**Chapter Six: The Star Lord Martial Curve**

The Primordial Lord spoke to the sagely Emperor: "As the lord of the people in this world, if you aspire to seek my methods, I bestow upon you the virtue of Heaven’s mechanism to augment your life. Let your household and state know peace, the people live without strife, and your lifespan be extended. Within the twelve hours, let there be little joy, little fear, little pleasure, and much suffering. Moreover, in the human body, the four great elements—bone and blood—correspond to the Five Phases. When metal, wood, water, fire, and earth follow their proper sequence, the myriad things are born, and the Dao and qi harmonize."

When metal and wood oppose each other, when water and fire overcome one another, humanity acts against the natural order, causing life to falter, the Dao and qi to fall out of harmony, households to know no peace, and calamity to draw near the people. Heaven and Earth cannot save them, for when one acts against the Way, a hundred misfortunes naturally follow.

**Chapter Seven: The Star Lord of Destruction**

The Primordial Lord spoke to the sagely Emperor: "To seek the methods of the highest sages is neither difficult nor easy—it lies solely in the heart of the seeker."

The Star Lord of Destruction asked the Emperor: "Will you attain it?"
The Emperor replied: "It is rare to encounter, and even rarer to comprehend the teachings of the true immortals."

The Primordial Lord said: "The round becomes square, the square becomes round. Within the four great elements of the human body lies a wondrous and true method. In the twelve hours, clasp your left hand with your right, and your right hand with your left. Exhale qi in nine revolutions—employ great fire and small water, small fire and great water. This will bring peace and health to the body, prevent the arising of a hundred calamities, extend your lifespan, and increase your blessings. From generation to generation, fortune and longevity will be passed down, the household and state will know tranquility, and the Dao and qi will naturally harmonize."

**Chapter Eight: The Great Dao of the Northern Primordial Unity**

The Lady of the Northern Dipper of the Great Dao proclaimed to the vast assembly of humans and heavens: "Those who accumulate myriad good causes reap myriad blessings, while those who accumulate myriad evil deeds suffer myriad afflictions. The wicked are ever enslaved by things, drifting through the cycles of birth and death, submerged in the sea of suffering.

Yet those who practice the Dao become the masters of the myriad things, untouched by the withering of the four seasons. I cause the myriad things to be empty, and those who do not cling to things avoid greed and wrath. Like clouds racing past the moon or a boat drifting while the shore appears to move, attachment to things harms the self. Know that the twofold Dharma is the mind beyond things, unattached to them. Then ruler and ministers will rejoice, the myriad people will know no suffering, the land will be purified, ghosts and spirits will show reverence, fruit trees will flourish, the five grains will ripen, the sun and moon will aid them, and the stars will protect them. The radiance of the Dao and qi will shine, and Heaven and Earth will naturally harmonize."

**Chapter Nine: The Northern Primordial Unity**

The Emperor asked the Primordial Lady: "The celestial registers of the highest immortals record their ceaseless journeys through day and night. What do they govern, and how many bureaus are there? I observe the radiance of day and night, the stars moving in their cycles, and the constellations arrayed in order, yet I do not understand their Way. I humbly beseech the Primordial Lady to linger like lingering auspicious clouds, to pause her crane-like steps, and to let her divine light remain, illuminating me. If I come to understand the Way of the highest immortals, I shall never forget this day’s encounter with the lofty perfected ones. I shall exhort the establishment of temples and monasteries throughout the land as eternal sanctuaries and compile the Daoist canon."

**Chapter Ten: The Northern Primordial Unity**

The Primordial Lady said: "Above, I govern the immortals of the myriad heavens; in the middle, I oversee the ghosts and spirits of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways; below, I manage the dark souls of the earthly prisons, the jailers of Mount Fengdu, and all beings within the Three Realms—those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation. In a single day and night, ten thousand die and ten thousand are born. The poor and lowly, the noble and wise, the karmic destinies of ghosts and spirits, the lengthening and shortening of lifespans, the violent deaths and injuries of the kalpic disasters, the jailers and prisoners, the dragon spirits who bring rain, the success or failure of the five grains, the illnesses of the four classes of people, the mountains and rivers, the waters and lands—all pass through the records of my thirty-six hundred bureau lords. In a single day and night, nothing is amiss. Heaven and Earth are impartial, and good and evil naturally unfold."

**Chapter Eleven: The Northern Primordial Unity**

The Emperor further asked the Primordial Lady: "Within the Three Realms, all living creatures fall under your governance. As the lord of the people, do I also belong to your jurisdiction?"

The Primordial Lady replied: "The immortals of the myriad heavens and the stellar generals of the celestial nets are all recorded in my registers—how much more so you! Moreover, in the primordial heavens of old, you were the marshal Tianpeng, the lord of the northern direction. Yet you conceived a fleeting thought of the strange illusions of the human world, and with that single念, you descended to become the lord of humanity. Now, having forgotten your original vow and united with the sagely and perfected, you have encountered the source of the Dao within our assembly. Suddenly, you have attained clarity, and the Dao and qi naturally return to their original state. When your heavenly blessings are complete and your merits and virtues perfected, you shall again meet Tianpeng and resume your place as the lord of heaven."

**Chapter Twelve: The Northern Primordial Unity**

The Emperor said: "I am overjoyed by the gracious countenance of the Primordial Lady. Today, my ministers and their families have all encountered the highest immortals and received the true teachings from beginning to end. I shall reverently follow your instructions and cultivate the ten thousand practices within the twelve hours to restore the source of the Dao. Yet I fear for the people—what methods can they use to extend their lives, eradicate sins, prolong blessings, and dispel calamities?"

The Lady of the Northern Dipper of the Great Dao replied: "I possess divine power and divine incantations. For all people in peril, suffering from illness, fear, or enmity, or those who seek private convenience—whether plagued by the cries of crows and a hundred omens, by *wangliang* and *chimei* spirits, or by lonely souls and lingering spirits of those who died in battle, drowned, hanged themselves, or were harmed by curses on fields, by celestial talismans bringing disease, or by pestilence—whether in childbirth where mother and child are not yet parted, or in city gods’ temples and earth shrines where spirits are unruly, or where shamans and sorcerers perform reckless and perverse rituals, bringing about inauspicious events—whether due to the kalpic disasters of Heaven and Earth, the failure of the five grains, or those who seek fame and profit, or offspring—bathe in fragrant water, and on the days of *gengshen* and *jiazi*, or on the days when the Northern Dipper descends each month, face north, burn incense, and sincerely inscribe my name: □□□□□□□ Star. All demons will be destroyed, and a hundred calamities will vanish. All shall attain auspiciousness: *Qianyuan heng li zhen*, peace and good fortune. If any ghosts disobey, their heads shall split into seven parts. The decree: *Om hum zhan ba!* Hasten as the law commands!"

**Chapter Thirteen: The Northern Primordial Unity**

The Primordial Lady said: "For all sentient beings in peril, suffering from illness, or facing blockages on all four paths with no way out—whether men or women, family members, parents, friends, or old acquaintances—if afflicted by celestial talismans or seasonal epidemics, let them purify themselves with fasting and bathing, let their hair down and go barefoot. At midnight, the hour of *zi*, face north, or stand in the central courtyard. Write seven memorials and present them to the celestial bureaus. Invoke my name and inscribe it on the memorials: □□□□□□□ Star. In the celestial bureaus, each star lord commands thirty-six hundred stellar officials and thirty-six thousand divine lords, along with the four duty *gongcao* spirits. Swiftly submit the memorials to the Golden Gates of the Jade Palace. All calamities, hardships, and entangling sufferings shall retreat and disperse, and evil ghosts shall be obliterated. Those who do not believe shall have their heads split into seven pieces."

The Perfected Sovereign commands: "Demonic spirits, perish! *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"

**Section Fourteen of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should *wangliang*, *chimei*, or lingering dead spirits not disperse, wailing day and night in terror, bringing calamities and misfortune, harming lives, consuming flesh and blood, frightening boys and girls, and causing a hundred kinds of suffering to disturb the living—let the household purify themselves with fasting and bathing. Inscribe my name: □□□□□□□ Star. I command all demons to self-annihilate, all misfortunes to dissolve, and all to attain the auspicious harmony of *Qianyuan hengli zhen*. May all affairs be peaceful. Should any ghost disbelieve, their heads shall split into seven pieces. *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

**Section Fifteen of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should there be vengeful curses, buried names or binding charms, effigies of straw or wood, or sorcerers employing perverse methods to invoke inauspicious omens—disturbing dreams, inverted fortunes, disputes over fields, wealth, or property, betrayal by friends, love turned to harm, or suffering under oppressive officials and unjust imprisonment—let the afflicted, with utmost sincerity, invoke my name: □□□□□□□ Star. The Dao’s *qi* shall then enter their body, and all difficulties shall disperse. I command Marshal Tianpeng, the Four-Eyed Elder, and eighty thousand celestial soldiers and warriors—each thirty-six *zhang* in height—to shake their bells and exert their power. *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

**Section Sixteen of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should the realm be unsettled, with calamities arising from all directions, or should the appointed time of heaven and earth bring disasters—celestial dragons sending floods, the earth failing to yield harvests, the five grains falling to famine, the five kalpas plunging the world into chaos, kings waging war, bandits rising, fires raging, or floods sweeping all away—let the sovereign, ministers, and common people alike, with sincere resolve, purify themselves with fasting and bathing. Prepare seven vermilion memorials, each detailing their plight, and inscribe my name upon them: □□□□□□□ Star. At midnight, the hour of *zi*, prostrate thrice in reverence. The Four Duty *Gongcao* spirits shall swiftly submit the memorials to the Golden Gates of the Jade Palace. The stellar lords shall render judgment. I command the dispatch of the Perfected Martial Great Sage of the Northern Dipper, Zhenwu, Marshal Tianpeng, the Four-Eyed Elder, and eighty thousand celestial soldiers and warriors—each thirty-six *zhang* in height—to shake their bells and exert their power. *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

**Section Seventeen of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should those dwelling in villages, wilderness, prefectures, counties, cities, or alleys be afflicted by celestial talismans or seasonal epidemics—where the five pestilences and their legions spread seventy-two toxic *qi*—this is by my decree, recorded in the registers of the Seven Primordials, the *Gongcao* spirits of the Great Year, and the duty spirits of the year, month, day, and hour. Each region and county shall suffer according to its allotted measure. Some may fall ill at dawn and die by dusk, or be struck by indiscriminate death talismans, their terror unassuaged. If there are pure Daoist companions or faithful men and women, let them each, with sincere devotion, burn incense, face north, and prostrate thrice in reverence. Invoke my name: □□□□□□□ Star. The Four Duty *Gongcao* spirits shall submit their pleas to the Golden Gates of the Jade Palace. I command the dispatch of Marshal Tianpeng, the Four-Eyed Elder, and eighty thousand celestial soldiers and warriors to descend and reclaim my celestial talisman registers of the five pestilences. Swiftly, let every household attain the harmony of *Qianyuan hengli zhen*, and may every door know prosperity. The Dao’s *qi* shall naturally prevail. Shake the bells and exert power! *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

**Section Eighteen of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should there be faithful Daoist followers or common folk without descendants, let them, on the days when the Dipper’s Perfected descends—*gengshen* and *jiazi*—burn incense, fast, recite my true scripture, and invoke my name: □□□□□□□ Star. Let incense and lamps burn without cease through the twelve hours, and let offerings of flowers, tea, and fruit never falter. After forty-nine days, or one hundred days, auspicious signs of the *Qian* Dao shall manifest. In the celestial bureaus, I oversee the registers, determining their allotted rank. I shall inscribe the birth of a wise son, blessed with a lifespan of a hundred years, free from calamity or hindrance, pure in virtue and power, to assist the human sovereign. Or, should they be destined for the *Kun* Dao, I shall grant the birth of a daughter of noble appearance, endowed with exceptional fortune and virtue. Such is the autonomous power of the divine. I command the auspicious harmony of *Qianyuan hengli zhen*! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

**Section Nineteen of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should parents, siblings, spouses, children, or other kin be imprisoned, executed, or perish by law; or fall victim to disputes over wealth or desire, languishing in bitter realms without hope of rebirth; or suffer in childbirth, mother and child undivided in death, their souls lingering in darkness, unable to ascend, bound to the ghostly realm without prospect of escape—let their faithful kin, on the days when the Dipper’s Perfected descends—*gengshen* and *jiazi*—at midnight, the hour of *zi*, burn incense with sincere devotion and invoke my name: □□□□□□□ Star. Declare their plight, face north, and prostrate thrice in reverence. I shall petition the Golden Gates of the Jade Palace, summoning the duty spirits and the Four-Eyed Elder to report to the *Gongcao* of life inscription. They shall record the dead according to their destined time, and in accordance with their karma, grant them rebirth. Shake the bells and exert power! *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should merchants traveling by boat encounter rapids where waves endanger their heavy cargo, or find themselves at sea without wind for their sails, unable to distinguish day from night, assailed by malevolent spirits—dragons, mirages, demons, or ghosts—let them swiftly inscribe my name: □□□□□□□ Star, along with the talisman, and cast it into the water. I shall command the celestial soldiers and warriors under my authority, the local water and earth deities, the River Earl, the Water Officials, and all spirits of city gods and earth altars to exert their power, aiding them to escape suffering and demonic perils. Those who disbelieve shall have their heads split into seven parts. Swiftly, swiftly, bring peace! *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole!

---

**Section Twenty-Two of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign declares: Should devout men or women, pure in heart, observe long fasts and invoke my name: □□□□□□□ Star, practice my great Dharma, study my true scriptures, and prostrate themselves for forty-nine days and nights, including auspicious evenings—or even for a lifetime or across kalpas in upholding the true Dharma, accumulating hidden merits—then in their next rebirth, they shall ascend to the celestial realms. The celestial bureaus shall record their names, and as they pass through villages, communities, or temples, they need not bow to the local spirits, who shall be unsettled and dare not accept their reverence. Instead, these ghosts and deities shall flee a thousand *li* away or sink a thousand *chi* into the earth. Those who disbelieve shall have their heads split into seven parts. *Oṃ hūṃ* sever and disperse! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

---

**Section Twenty-Three of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign addresses the Emperor: When people perform the *Chaoyuan* rites and Dharma practices, purifying body and mind to eradicate past karmic deeds, relinquishing all deluded thoughts and unwholesome intentions—regarding the foolish as cherished as jewels in their palms, yet seeing the noble as irritants like sand in their eyes—when their minds and actions turn to all manner of unwholesomeness, whether due to karmic debts from three lifetimes, their own malevolence, the death of family members, insufficient clothing or food, lack of noble patrons, domestic or national unrest, or whether they act as commoners, for others, for fame or profit, for constructing graves or buildings, for themselves, their families, their nation’s military campaigns, their parents’ illnesses, disasters of water or fire, or the depravities of evil people—when subjected to official punishments or all manner of misfortunes, let each person sincerely purify themselves through fasting and the Dao, bathe in fragrant waters, don plain robes and caps, red shoes, and a wooden tablet one *chi* and two *cun* in length. Let them prepare a sandalwood altar, painted with cinnabar, two *chi* and four *cun* long and seven *cun* and seven *fen* high, with an incense burner placed upon it. Ascend to a high place, face north, and with utmost sincerity, gaze toward my celestial palace until midnight. Invoke my name and perform three sets of three prostrations. From the first to the seventh day of the seventh month, for seven nights, arrange incense and lamps with devout reverence and bow in homage.

**First *Chaoyuan* Prostration (three bows):**
Rise, hold the tablet, and declare your intentions:
*"Your servant petitions the Perfected Sovereign of the Northern Dipper and all celestial asterisms. May the clarity of heaven and earth witness this: let all ghosts, deities, heavenly dragons, and beings receive the enduring Dao-qi of their respective paths, and may the myriad things of heaven and earth arise naturally."*

**Second *Chaoyuan* Prostration (three bows):**
*"Your servant petitions the Perfected Sovereign of the Northern Dipper: In past years, when my parents passed away, I feared they might fall into the dark paths, enduring the torments of hell, long sunk in the ghostly realms, their sins recorded in the underworld bureaus, unable to transcend. With no means to repay the grace of heaven and earth, the love of parents who bore me, or the teachings of friends and mentors—*
*If my parents are still alive, I humbly pray that the Perfected Sovereign, with the gaze of wisdom from the celestial offices, bestow upon me a single repayment: may the living gain blessings, the departed transcend, and may my parents forever follow the Dao’s teachings, eternally freed from suffering."*

**Third *Chaoyuan* Prostration (three bows):**
*"Your servant petitions the Perfected Sovereign of the Northern Dipper: I, a humble being in the lower realm, am a mortal whose fate is recorded in the celestial registers of the Perfected Immortals. My clothing and food are insufficient through the four seasons, my wealth and grains perpetually depleted. My endeavors fail, and I fear my past sins have accumulated to this day. With no means to express my gratitude, I now, by good fortune, have encountered the true teachings of the Perfected Immortals. Following the rites and Dharma, I prostrate myself, humbly praying that the Perfected Sovereign bestow upon me a hundred blessings and a thousand auspices, that all things attain the primal harmony of *qian*, and that the myriad things flourish in uprightness. Your servant bows again in reverence."*

---

**Section Twenty-Four of the Northern Primordial Compendium**
The Perfected Sovereign further addresses the Emperor: On the ninth night of the ninth month, at midnight during the *zi* hour, perform the *Chaoyuan* rites and Dharma practices, entrusting them to those who take refuge in my Dharma and propagate it among the people of the world. Liberate the hungry ghosts, animals, those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation, as well as prisoners in hell and all beings in suffering. On this night, the Northern Dipper’s celestial chariot, the High Perfected, records the registers of merit and sin, determining people’s clothing, food, fortune, poverty, nobility, servitude, and all other conditions. All is fixed in this month’s records, with no discrepancy between good and evil. I expound this scripture and Dharma for the sake of all sentient beings—ghosts, deities, the myriad people, the four kinds of birth, hungry ghosts, the kings and ministers of the world, soldiers, commoners, and all beings. Should they follow my Dharma and perform the nine nights of *Chaoyuan* rites, I shall, from my celestial palace, meticulously review and select their destinies among the immortals of the southern realms, granting their wishes to the finest detail.
Should they seek the Dao and its methods, the heavenly Dao shall hear and respond to their prayers.
Should they seek clothing, food, official rank, or emoluments, they shall receive a hundred blessings and a thousand fortunes, their personal Dao-qi enduring, and the myriad things arising naturally.

At midnight during the *zi* hour on the first day of the ninth month, prostrate before the first palace of the Northern Dipper, the Star Lord of Greed and Wolf. Within the first case, he oversees three hundred and sixty star officials, three hundred and sixty bureaus, and thirty-six hundred celestial offices. Clad in azure robes, crowned with an azure cap, and shod in red shoes, he holds a green tablet. He is attended by thirty-six hundred youths, dressed in azure, bearing green banners and floral canopies, corresponding to the *jia-yi* wood of the east.

The Star Lord of Greed and Wolf judges the affairs of the living and the dead.
Your servant invokes the Northern Dipper’s Star Lord of Greed and Wolf, who benevolently records the life and death of mortals, ensuring equitable good deeds. May the sovereign enjoy ten thousand years of life, court ministers remain loyal, and human affairs flow in harmony. Spare them from exile, execution, or decapitation, that each may be born and die in goodness, never obscuring the heart of the Dao. May pure *qi* endure, and the myriad things arise naturally. Such a person shall accrue three thousand six hundred and ninety measures of merit, their transgressions gradually dissolving. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!

At midnight during the *zi* hour on the second day of the ninth month, prostrate before the Northern Dipper’s second palace, the Star Lord of Great Gate, who benevolently records longevity among mortals.

Within his case, he oversees three hundred and sixty star officials, three hundred and sixty bureaus, and three thousand six hundred celestial offices. Clad in black robes, crowned with a black cap, and shod in red shoes, he holds a black tablet. He is attended by three thousand six hundred youths, dressed in black, bearing black banners, corresponding to the *ren-gui* water of the north.

The Star Lord of Destruction and War, pivot of the jade celestial mechanism, axis of the Dipper’s hub, arbiter of the living and the dead. Your servant humbly petitions the Star Lord of Destruction and War of the Northern Dipper, the Heavenly Stem Great Sage Dharma King Heavenly Lord, the Inner Enclosure Emperor’s Throne Venerable Star Lord, the Outer Enclosure Terrace-Assistant Longevity and Prosperity Lord, the Life-Prolonging and Destiny-Protecting Lord, the Calamity-Dispelling and Disaster-Eradicating Lord, the Decay-Supporting and Misfortune-Dispersing Lord, the Lifespan-Enhancing and Harmony-Balancing Lord, the Seven Primes Generals, and the Nine Palaces Heavenly Queen. First, I beseech forgiveness for the thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins of your servant’s past and present lives. Next, I beseech deliverance for the lingering souls of ancestors and departed kin, bound by grievances. May your servant be spared suffering and distress, granted favorable karmic conditions, untouched by the myriad calamities, with malevolent spirits subdued and hidden. May all that is sought be attained, and all that is pursued be prosperous.

Moreover, beneath the palace of the Star Lord of Destruction, benevolent records are made of mortal injuries, violent deaths, and the afflictions of prisoners and those in bondage. I beseech the celestial grace that my Dao-heart remain unobscured, with pure *qi* enduring eternally, and all things in their natural state. May merchants and travelers, public and private affairs, all be blessed with myriad fortunes. May descendants flourish, and the primal harmony prevail. Such a person shall accrue three thousand eight hundred merits. Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

On the eighth night of the ninth month, at midnight, prostrate before the Northern Dipper’s eighth palace, the Star Lord of the Left Assistant, arbiter of the living and the dead, who records the fates of servants and slaves among mortals. Within his case, he oversees three hundred and sixty star officials and three hundred and sixty celestial offices, each holding registers to govern the lifespans and deaths of the world’s servants and steeds.

Within his case, he oversees three hundred and sixty star officials and three hundred and sixty celestial offices, each holding registers to govern the lifespans and deaths of the world’s maidservants and bondswomen.

May pure *qi* endure eternally, all things be in their natural state, and all matters harmonize.

By the August Mandate of the Supreme Emperor, this decree is issued to the Heavenly Talisman Marshal of the Capital of All Heavens, the True Lord who executes affairs, the Ghost King of Epidemic Diseases for the twelve-year cycle, the five pestilence ghost hosts of the *jia-yi* wood essence of the east, the five pestilence ghost hosts of the *bing-ding* fire essence of the south, the five pestilence ghost hosts of the *geng-xin* metal essence of the west, the five pestilence ghost hosts of the *ren-gui* water essence of the north, the five pestilence ghost hosts of the *wu-ji* earth essence of the center, the myriad epidemic ghost spirits of the world, the twenty-four *qi* spirit kings, the seventy-two seasonal ghost kings, and all epidemic ghost spirits under the jurisdiction of the Cave Abyss Samādhi. Whether by the phases of the Five Agents—metal, wood, water, fire, or earth—when metal and wood clash, mortals suffer executions and exile; when water and fire clash, mortals suffer violent deaths or injuries by tigers and wolves; when water and earth clash, mortals suffer from jaundice and perish in epidemics. These ghosts are burned by fire.

This decree commands them to descend year by year and month by month to their respective prefectures and counties, visiting every household in temples and monasteries across the land to inspect and record their merits and transgressions. Those who fail to practice virtuous dharma shall be struck down by celestial thunder, burned by fire, or drowned by water. Whether officials, the wealthy, or the powerful, those who accumulate no goodness, perpetrate evil, and fail to recognize the worthy—be they magistrates, jailers, or village heads—who exacerbate the law’s severity, oppress the good, and ignore the cries of the people, or whose superiors remain blind to virtue, shall be punished. This decree commands the Four-Eyed Elder, who shakes the bell and wields the executioner’s blade, to lead the hosts of the five pestilences in their descent to the mortal realm. Those who defy this law, mocking or insulting it, shall be annihilated, their lineages extinguished.

The Primordial Lord further addressed the Emperor: On the ninth night of the ninth month, at midnight, if one, together with their household, observes a pure fast, practices the Dao, dons immaculate robes and cap, and offers fragrant incense and white memorials, prostrating thrice in succession and presenting their wishes, I shall observe them from the Seven Primes Palace. At the Golden Gates of the Celestial Palace, the celestial officials on duty for the year, month, day, and hour, along with the True Officer of Heaven, shall promptly receive and present their petitions. Whatever is sought or revealed shall be swiftly judged as good or evil, and their fate determined. The living shall have their lifespans extended, and blessings and prosperity shall come naturally. Descendants shall inherit these fortunes generation after generation. The departed shall ascend to heaven, escape the realms of suffering, and be reborn in auspicious destinies. If seeking fame or profit, their rank shall correspond to their aspirations. If redressing grievances, their cases shall be sent to the courts of Fengdu and Mount Tai, swiftly adjudicated in the Bureau of Retribution. Heaven and earth are impartial. Should a king prostrate before the Dipper, his realm and the four directions shall know peace, the eight wilds shall submit, the five grains ripen, fruits and trees flourish, and the people live without strife. Heaven and earth shall protect him, and the stars shall honor him. Should one with a pure Dao-heart prostrate before the Dipper, their district shall be free of demonic afflictions. Such a person, through sincere devotion and accumulated merit, prostrating for one, two, or three years—or eighteen years—shall enable the seven ancestors and nine lineages to transcend and be reborn in blissful realms, while the living shall gain blessings. Those who defy this law shall have their heads split into seven parts, their lifelines severed.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Northern Dipper’s Entrusted Petition**
The superior adept forgets form to seek the truth of the Dao. The Dao’s profound mystery holds dominion over the world, adapting to circumstances and transforming in response, like the tortoise’s divination or the oracle’s discernment of fortune and misfortune. Heaven sends sweet rain to universally succor all things, benefiting the world and aiding humanity, arriving without announcement. Heaven and earth nurture the myriad beings—thus is the superior adept’s pursuit of the Dao.

The middling adept seeks the Dao for fame and profit, an external learning that abandons the burning house of worldly attachments, indulging in fleeting pleasures, ensnared by material desires. Their lifelong suffering extends to their descendants, who endure hardship for generations. Excess in food and clothing wastes heaven and earth’s labor. The Three Offices impose retribution, reducing them to poverty, their suffering spanning lifetimes, their deaths consigning them to the dark paths without hope of escape—thus is the middling adept’s pursuit of the Dao.

The inferior adept seeks the Dao, treating it as a mere gateway, coveting wealth and sensual pleasures, discoursing on past and present with their lips while their hearts know only deceitful conduct. They prize the pursuit of food and clothing, oblivious to the Dao’s source, drifting through the cycles of life and death, sinking into the苦海 of suffering. The Three Offices consign them to the underworld courts, condemning them to rebirth as oxen or horses, spinning endlessly through the wheel of existence. Death casts them into rebirth, never to encounter the true Dao, never to hear of meritorious deeds—thus is the inferior adept’s pursuit of the Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Northern Dipper’s Entrusted Charge**

The Primordial Sovereign of the Great Dao and Northern Dipper once more addressed the Emperor, saying: On the days when I descend from the celestial palace each season and month, I lead the hosts of heaven’s immortals, the Four-Eyed Elder, and the twelve hourly messengers of the Four Quarters to the lower realms. There, we inspect kings, ministers, prefectural and county officials, scholars and commoners, monks and nuns, Daoists and laity, as well as the spirits of mountain forests, altars, and temples, the river lords and water officials, the deities of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, the Yangzi, Huai, and Ji, the numina of trees and ancient woods, the spirits of cliffs and caves, and the bridges and aged trees that have grown sentient over centuries—all the *wangliang* demons, monstrous apparitions, and various dragons and *shen* that feed on human blood and take human lives. We examine the dwellings and ancestral tombs of the people, all construction and orientation of residences, and whether they have offended the celestial stars or terrestrial constellations, along with every virtuous thought in the hearts of all people.

The intent of the Great Dao is to act with impartiality, to succor the poor and destitute, to provide clothing and food, and to offer medicine to all the sick. We interrogate the local deities—kings of spirits, altar lords, household earth gods, Stove Lords, and the seventy-two deities of taboos—regarding the inhabitants of each dwelling: good men and faithful women, elders and juniors, masters and servants, bondservants and maidservants, or even sojourners. If any, with sincere hearts, aspire to the primordial and reverently uphold the Dipper’s methods, they shall receive boundless clothing and food, their lifespans extended, and they shall be spared from warfare, misfortune, and all suffering. They will be granted 11,800 merits, constantly protected by benevolent stars. The dragon spirits of their dwelling’s domain shall also receive 32,000 merits and 88,000 ranks of emolument, transcending the ghostly realms to be reborn in the celestial cities and palaces of the upper realms. There, they shall enjoy the joys of humans and gods, ascending to the ranks of stellar officials and perfected lords.

For those who align their dwellings and orient their palaces, great peace shall be attained, their every wish fulfilled, and the gods shall guard and bless them.

Moreover, if kings, great ministers, civil and military officials hear of the Northern Dipper’s entrusted charge and, with reverent hearts, gaze toward the Dipper from afar to pay homage, beseeching the blessing of peace for their states and families—

Or if the people of the world, with their entire households and loved ones, unite in faith, purify body and mind, and sincerely pay homage to the primordial, they shall receive the celestial courts’ inscription of blessings, their names recorded in the earthly registers. The Southern Dipper shall inscribe their lives, and the Primordial Chronograms shall protect them together. The Three Officials—the Emperors of Heaven, Earth, and Water—and the hosts of immortals of the Three Bureaus shall jointly memorialize the accumulated merits to the Northern Pole Great Emperor. The Dipper Pivot of Our Northern Bureau shall dispatch the Four-Eyed Elder to lead the 3,600 case offices in compiling and submitting the records to the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Supreme Heaven. We shall personally memorialize their elevation to the rank of Impartial Life-Inscribing Perfected Lords, jointly governing the people of the lower realms, dispelling all noxious *qi*. Their living kin shall be protected by the myriad spirits, their descendants generation after generation delivered from disaster and blessed with fortune—this is no empty promise.

If there are people who do not practice the virtuous Dao, who cheat in weights and measures, whose hearts harbor hidden malice, who commit manifold evil deeds, who scheme against the good—then the spirits shall strike their names from the registers, diminishing their blessings, emoluments, and lifespans. Their names shall be inscribed in the ledgers of sins and sent to hell, forever losing their human form. They shall drift through the cycles of life and death, rarely encountering liberation. If reborn, they may lack the six senses or endure all manner of suffering: their spirits dimmed, their clothes insufficient to cover their bodies, their food inadequate to fill their mouths, or they may suffer imprisonment, hardship, and unending peril.

The Primordial Sovereign further addressed the Emperor, saying: All living beings who think and act with goodness shall receive the retribution of good fruits; those who think and act with evil shall receive the retribution of evil karma. The words of the Great Dao are true and not false. Those who do not believe shall be punished by countermanding the law: I shall command the Five Thunder Messengers of the Central Heaven to strike them down with thunderbolts, the Five Pestilence Great Commissioners to afflict them with deadly diseases, and the hosts of the Fiery Star of the Southern Thearch to incinerate and annihilate them.

Each year, on the days of My seasonal descents, I traverse the regions and domains, inspecting the guardian spirits of states, commanderies, prefectures, counties, towns, and villages, the dragon spirits of altars and dwellings, the Stove Lords, and the deities of the land. The Four-Eyed Elder examines the city gods, earth masters, and local spirits, along with the altar lords of the Nine Provinces and Ten Continents, the Stove Lords, and the recording deities of the registers. Each month and hour, they transcribe the good and evil of the human world and memorialize it to the celestial courts—reward and punishment are impartial.

Moreover, on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth days of the first month, the third and seventh days of the second month, and the twenty-third and twenty-sixth days of the third month—these three months being spring—the Celestial Thunder and Celestial Fire shall burn away those who die from the Five Pestilences and seasonal epidemics. Those who study the Dao and seek the true, their hearts undivided, shall have their blessings inscribed and their lives extended.

On the seventeenth and twenty-seventh days of the fourth month, the fifth, thirteenth, and twentieth days of the fifth month, and the fourth and eighth days of the sixth month—these being summer—the dragons shall distribute rain, and the records of good and evil shall be compiled according to their weight. Those who accumulate goodness shall receive tenfold recompense in full; those who accumulate evil shall have their merits reduced by four-tenths.

On the fourth and twenty-fourth days of the seventh month, the eleventh, nineteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the eighth month, and the third and eighteenth days of the ninth month—these being autumn—the harvest of the five grains shall be assessed, and the degrees of good and evil shall be apportioned. The registers shall be transcribed and compiled, blessings and misfortunes adjusted, with not the slightest partiality.

On the tenth and twenty-sixth days of the tenth month, the first, ninth, seventeenth, and twenty-fifth days of the eleventh month, and the twentieth day of the twelfth month—these being winter—the deities shall inspect the good and evil, the hidden and concealed, of the people across the Four Heavens. Moreover, at midnight of the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, as the Year-Star of the old year yields to that of the new, the positions of the Three Sha and the Twelve Taboos shall be assessed. For those of sincere devotion, regardless of high or low station, noble or base—whether spirits in the ghostly realm, beings in the animal realm, or souls in the hellish realm; whether women wishing to be reborn as men; those bedridden with chronic illness; those robbed by brigands on the road; those falsely accused by enemies; those afflicted by official calamities or misfortune; those framed by neighbors; those imprisoned for years with no hope of release; those stricken by the Five Pestilences; those cursed by sorcerers; those at odds with brothers; those in discord with spouses; those entangled in the pursuit of fame and profit; those without sons or daughters; those trapped in evil destinies or unkind places; those beset by floods or sea-monsters; those whose construction of altars or selection of directions has erred in year, month, day, or hour, offending inauspicious stars or malevolent spirits; or those engaged in warfare or entering battle with all manner of uncertainties—on the days when the Perfected of the Dipper descend, let them purify themselves, fast with sincerity, burn incense, and prostrate in worship, facing north with single-minded reverence. Let them present their pleas, and I, the Recording Immortal of the Dipper’s Bureau, shall weigh the degrees of their goodness and evil. I shall dispel misfortune and bestow blessings: if their karmic burden is heavy, their hidden sins shall be meted out, lest they fall from human form; if their virtuous power is great, I shall inscribe for them fifteen thousand eight hundred blessings. With their Dao-practice pure and their merit complete, the Perfected Immortals of my Dipper Palace shall memorialize the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven, beseeching the issuance of a sacred decree and talismanic command. The Great Sage Marshal Tianpeng, the Perfected Warrior of Dark Might, shall lead his generals, the Four-Eyed Elder, and their divine retinues, each manifesting a dharma-body of thirty-six *zhang*, to obey the decree at all times and rescue the living, daring not disobey the command.

I proclaim this scripture to open the paths of deliverance for both the living and the dead, that the wronged and the deceased may each attain liberation, and that the living and the virtuous may together increase in fortune and longevity. Those who cultivate the Dao of immortality shall swiftly attain immortal rank. Such are the great responses to reciting this scripture, venerating the Primordial, and worshipping the Dipper.

Should any ghosts or spirits disbelieve and defy my words, their heads shall shatter and their clans be annihilated. By my decree, I shall sever their demonic roots—hasten, hasten, in accordance with the law!

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Dipper’s Entrustment**
The Lady of the Primordial again addressed the Emperor, saying: In future kalpas, when you attain the rank of High Perfected and Upper Immortal, and become Marshal Tianpeng, I shall bestow upon you the sacred illumination of my touch upon your crown, granting you eighteen thousand blessings. With your pure Dao-conduct and sublime merit, widely propagate my Dharma to benefit the living in the world, for all shall depend upon your sagely and luminous great field of blessings.

**The Lady of the Primordial Praises the Scripture, saying:**
A household with the Dipper Scripture brings peace to family and state.
A household with the Dipper Scripture naturally enjoys long life.
A household with the Dipper Scripture sees the dead attain rebirth.
A household with the Dipper Scripture cannot be harmed by official calamities.
A household with the Dipper Scripture sees its five grains ripen of themselves.
A household with the Dipper Scripture cannot be invaded by malevolent spirits.
A household with the Dipper Scripture finds safety even in the dead of night.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Dipper’s Entrustment**
The Lady of the Primordial said: I now bestow upon you, one and all, the charge to uphold and protect these true words, which surpass gold and jade in value. This is the Dharma of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven—auspicious and wondrous verses, radiant as the sun and moon, bright as the stars and Dipper. I now grant it to you to govern the world of mortals. May all people return to the good Dao, and may each and every one revert to the Primordial and face the Origin.

She further addressed the Emperor, saying: Protect the people well, and forever serve as the master of the Dharma for heaven and earth, mountains and rivers. Disseminate it through the world, that its merit not be obscured. The preceding chapters have been distinguished one by one, and there is no falsehood in them.

Our assembly now receives the Jade Emperor’s decree to proclaim this edict. We shall not tarry long, but each return to our celestial abodes. This scripture must not be treated with disrespect. You must purify yourselves, burn incense with utmost sincerity, don Daoist robes and plain garments, and recite it with single-minded devotion, as if facing me in person.

Upon hearing these words, the Emperor bowed deeply, prostrated himself twice, and took his leave. The sagely carriage returned to the immortal palace. The August Emperor of the Great Han, the Sagely Lord Ming, then issued an edict to the provincial departments, directing that the scripture be delivered to renowned mountains, blessed lands, and Daoist abbeys for transcription and transmission to humans and gods, that all may believe, receive, and uphold it.

Here ends the *Scripture of the Twenty-Eight Chapters of the Northern Dipper of the Most High*.
