**The Most High Lord Lao’s Scripture on Dispelling Disasters**

On the bingwu day of the twenty-eighth of the fourth month in the gengyin year, the Most High Lord Lao, together with the great sages of all heavens, sat upon the Azure Radiance Palace and the Five Clouds Throne. Immortal attendants stood in guard, their numbers beyond count, bearing banners and holding incense, arrayed to his left and right, all assembled as one.

He summoned the celestial immortals and terrestrial immortals, the immortals of the Five Marchmounts, the thirty-six sovereigns of the celestial immortals, the twenty-four sovereigns of the terrestrial immortals, the ten sovereigns of the divine immortals, and the multitude of flying immortals and great sages. Additionally, the thirty-six myriad upper immortals of foreign lands, the twenty-five myriad middle immortals, and the fourteen myriad lower immortals, along with the eight great dragon lords, the eight great ghost lords, the eight great beast lords, the lords of the Three and Five, and the twenty-four natures—all came to gather.

He commanded the celestial and terrestrial registrars of the Heavenly Capital to immediately record the names of all malevolent demons, evil ghosts, *chimei* and *wangliang*, bandits and thieves, tigers and wolves, as well as those afflicted by unjust officials, slanderous tongues, warfare, floods, fires, illnesses, disasters, and dire calamities. Regardless of gender, all who suffer must bathe in fragrant waters, observe purification and fasts, light lamps, burn incense, pay reverence, and recite this scripture in offering.

If a household is plagued by demonic hordes, bandits, spectral perils, or pestilential epidemics, or faces dire calamities, they should invoke the thirty-six vajras, the twenty-five divine kings, the twenty-seven *lishi*, and the thirty-seven celestial masters. All these vajras, divine kings, *lishi*, and celestial masters govern the myriad illnesses, disasters, and transformations, as well as all matters of fortune and misfortune, good and evil.

If faithful men and women observe perpetual purification, burn incense, and reverently recite this scripture, their merit shall be boundless. All their thousands of disasters and myriad illnesses, along with malevolent bandits, tigers, wolves, and every affliction, shall naturally vanish. The Heavenly Worthy shall bestow blessings, sheltering them, and all their aspirations shall be fulfilled without fail. Their households shall know peace, their descendants shall flourish, and those who cultivate this practice shall attain spiritual resonance. Those who treat it with contempt shall bring calamity upon their nine generations. Let this be proclaimed to all men and women, that they may understand karmic retribution and thereby gain benefit.

Lord Lao said: These celestial masters reside above the thirty-six heavens, yet they descend to govern the world, universally commanding ghosts and spirits, as well as all spectral perils, pestilential qi, tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, seasonal epidemics, slanderous tongues, and curses—all are under their dominion.

If one does not believe in the Daoist teachings, violates the immortal scriptures, devotes themselves to heterodox deities, practices mundane doctrines, follows perverse customs, or sacrifices to ghosts and spirits—such transgressions shall multiply their sins. Ignorant and defiled, they turn their backs on the true faith and embrace evil, thus facing judgment. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall remain in darkness; for a thousand kalpas, they shall endure punishment before being reborn as beasts, assuming non-human forms, subjected to servitude beyond comprehension. Upon death, they shall descend into hell, with no hope of return. Their sins are too grave to recount.

Even if such individuals are reborn, they shall perpetually suffer from illnesses, poverty, and hardship, never knowing peace. They shall be oppressed by officials, harmed by others, their lifespans cut short, and upon death, they shall enter the eternal night of the underworld, unknown to all. For a hundred kalpas, they shall endure punishment before regaining human form.

Should one purify the heart and reform their conduct, they may attain rebirth; but those who remain deluded and refuse to turn back draw near to death, destined to dwell eternally in evil realms, with no hope of rebirth. Now I solemnly admonish you—heed this warning well.

At that moment, the perfected immortals and great sages rejoiced and leapt with joy, bowing their heads in reverence and reciting these verses:

The Dao’s words are most subtle and wondrous,
Universally saving and delivering gods and humans.
Those who cultivate shall all attain the Dao;
Those who turn away shall bring calamity upon themselves.
This sutra can dispel disasters,
Wash away defilement, and sever the dust of clamor.
Yet beings, lacking wisdom,
Defy it and believe in evil spirits.
Upon death, they enter the suffering of freezing ice,
Enduring bitter and arduous punishments.
Only by turning the heart to the true Dao
Can one receive the true body.
With wholehearted devotion to the immortal path,
One may cross the celestial ford.
Forever enjoying boundless life,
Their forms multiply into a million perfected beings.
The Nine Dark Realms are forever cast open,
And the seven generations of ancestors escape the gloomy ford.
Naturally partaking of the celestial kitchen’s fare,
All depend on the sagely emperor’s grace.
Singing sacred hymns along the mysterious path,
For ten thousand kalpas they preserve purity.
Delivering all beings of this world,
The Three Perfected respond to the sagely emperor.
The five directions fall silent,
And the Dao’s teachings gradually illuminate the age.

It is like a man at midday—
Yet demons and specters enter his heart’s storehouse.
Yin and yang may wane or wax,
And the people all suffer famine.
When the perfected one is about to depart,
The world’s chaos becomes truly unbearable.
The hidden dragon stirs once more,
Closing its eyes in the secluded chamber.
The madman’s inverted karma
Will soon bring misfortune upon himself.
Sinking into the depths of hell,
He suffers the agony of torture and wounds.
All stems from the perverse views of the heart,
Leading to such scorching terror.
The Diamond Mandate commands the ascent to the Dao,
Its mighty power shattering the wilderness of delusion.
With songs of harmony and peace,
The supreme Dao is forever revealed.
Winds are harmonious and rains timely,
The five grains fill the overflowing granaries.
The four directions all submit in reverence,
And qilin and phoenix naturally appear as auspicious signs.
When the enlightened ruler upholds the Dao,
For ten thousand kalpas, the years shall be long.

Lord Lao addressed Yin Xi, saying: "This scripture is most venerable, the essential key by which all immortals attain truth. You have now received my essential teaching—you must cultivate it with utmost dedication, preserve it within, and never reveal it to the unworthy. Only those who study the Daoist path, along with faithful men and women of good intent, may receive and transmit it according to its precepts. Clearly expound its methods, strictly observe its precepts and prohibitions, and take care not to miss the proper time. I now solemnly repeat: do not transmit it recklessly. My words are profoundly secret—guard them well."

Yin Xi then prostrated himself, knelt, and received the scripture.

At that moment, all the perfected immortals and assembled transcendents, having heard the scripture expounded, withdrew from their seats with reverence. After standing in attendance for a brief while, a multitude of immortals descended from the floating void, their number beyond count. Each bore incense and flowers, holding talismans and jade tablets, and came before the Dao. Together they bowed in unison, entreating Lord Lao to return to the Jade Capital.

Lord Lao, now joyfully preparing to ascend, addressed Yin Xi once more: "I shall now rise on high. You, having received this scripture, will surely attain the Dao."

Yin Xi, overcome with sorrow and tears, prostrated himself in gratitude. Suddenly, Lord Lao vanished from sight. Only the resonant music shook the mountains and rivers. Looking up, he saw the dragon-drawn chariots, swirling clouds of qi receding into the distance, their five colors radiant and bright—unrecognizable to the world. In an instant, they grew ever more distant, until they faded from view.

Thus concludes *The Most High Lord Lao’s Scripture on Dispelling Disasters*.
