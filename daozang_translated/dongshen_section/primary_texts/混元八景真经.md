**Fascicle One of *The Scripture of the Primordial Eight Effulgences***

The Perfected of the Primordial Dao states:

Before the existence of Heaven and Earth, at the inception of primordial chaos, when the myriad things had yet to germinate, there was emptiness without void—only the formless and the nonexistent. Within this formless nonexistence dwelled *jingqi* (effulgent qi). When *jingqi* reached its extremity, it gave birth to *yaoming* (profound obscurity). When *yaoming* reached its extremity, moisture arose. When moisture manifested to its fullest, it first congealed into mist and dew. When mist and dew reached their extremity, they transformed into water. The water flowed downward, and when it filled to its capacity—

This flowing water was *yin* qi. When *yin* reached its extremity, *yang* qi was born. *Yang* qi gradually ascended, and its scorching heat congealed into fire. Fire was born from water, and when water and fire interacted, they gradually harmonized. The two elements intermingled in great peace, each generating accumulated qi. From this accumulation, *yin* and *yang* refined one another. When their numerical measure was fulfilled, primordial chaos took form.

Once primordial chaos was established, it became *One Qi*. From the germination of *One Qi* arose the Mother of Heaven and Earth. Primordial chaos was born from *xuqi* (void qi). It then established *yin* and *yang*, produced the Five Phases, and established the Four Images.

When the Primordial Qi reached its extremity, primordial chaos began to divide, and thus the *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning) was born. Once *Yuanshi* arose, it separated the accumulated pure qi to form Heaven and the accumulated turbid qi to form Earth. Heaven and Earth were established: the light and pure ascended to become Heaven, while the heavy and turbid descended to become Earth.

Though the light and pure belonged to *yang*, they internally generated *yin* qi, which descended to form Earth. Though the heavy and turbid belonged to *yin*, they internally generated *yang* qi, which ascended to form Heaven. Thus, Heaven descended and Earth ascended, water and fire intermingled, and *yin* and *yang* contended. When their intermingling qi reached fullness, the Great Elixir took form—this was the Great Yang, the sun.

As the sun was revolved by Heaven and Earth, *jin* qi (metal qi) arose. *Jin* qi belonged to *yin*. When its revolving qi was fulfilled, the Great Yin was born—this was the moon. Thereafter, the sun and moon intermingled in great peace, *yin* and *yang* refined one another, and when their numerical measure was fulfilled, the stars and constellations gradually took form.

From antiquity to the present, all things have arisen without departing from Heaven’s descent and Earth’s ascent, the intermingling of *yin* and *yang*, and the union of the sun and moon. From the true qi, the myriad things are born. Among all things, only humans are the most numinous and noble.

Thus, the One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three, and the Three generate the myriad things. Humans, together with the myriad things, must receive the revolving numerical measure of *yin*, *yang*, and the Five Phases to be fully realized.

For those who study the Dao, if they do not know where to begin at the root and source, how can they attain the Dao and achieve perfection? If one cultivates in accordance with the original foundation, following the revolving transformations of Heaven and Earth’s *yin* and *yang*, the Five Phases, water and fire in great peace, with internal and external correspondence, and true qi fulfilled—how can one not attain the divine, the sagely, and the transcendent?

The Way of the *xian* (immortals) is also divided into three ranks, and each rank is further divided into three, making nine in total—hence the Nine Grades of Immortals.

The highest three grades of immortals must practice the *guan tian zhi dao* (Way of Observing Heaven), following the movements and measures of Heaven and Earth at their inception. Only when the qi and seasons are fulfilled can one attain longevity. This practice is arduous. This Way requires that one does not violate the *Three Marvels*. One must follow the movements of Heaven and Earth, with internal and external correspondence. When the great work is complete, one attains the rank of Perfected of the Upper Grade.

If, in one’s youth, one violated the *Three Marvels*, one must then seize and replenish the *yang* essence from the *Li Long Yuan Gong* (Palace of the Departed Dragon) to restore it as before. Only after completing the great work of *guan tian* can one attain the rank of Perfected of the Middle Grade.

If one does not employ seizure but merely awaits the fulfillment of one’s present essence, qi, and spirit, one attains only the rank of *dixian* (earthbound immortal) of the lower three grades.

Beyond these three ranks and nine grades of immortals, there exists the *ziran jindan* (spontaneous Golden Elixir). The Golden Elixir is born of Heaven and Earth, and though it fills the world, worldly people are unaware of the secret arts of the Upper Heavens. Among the myriad who study the Dao, few encounter this. It is the *nei jinye dahuan dan* (Internal Golden Fluid Great Return Elixir). Among elixirs, it is the supreme.

The Internal Golden Elixir is the *jinye huan dan* (Golden Fluid Return Elixir). It does not appear in the ancient texts on elixirs and is the foremost. Upon encountering it, one moves from nonbeing into being without the need for human cultivation. If one encounters it, one may gather and ingest it, thereby attaining the rank of Perfected.

The Internal Golden Elixir is first gathered from the *hun* (soul) of the sun and the *po* (spirit) of the moon, which are conjoined and nurtured through the union of *yin* and *yang*. All Internal Golden Elixirs undergo the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases and Four Images, the alternation of closure and openness, the seventy-two seasonal markers, the twenty-four qi, the four seasons and eight nodes, and the revolving refinement of Heaven and Earth before the *nei jinye huan dan* is achieved.

Its elixir resembles a radiant cherry, formed within the *Li Long Jin Tang* (Golden Hall of the Departed Dragon). After three thousand six hundred hours, when the celestial tally is fulfilled, it ripens. Its gathering must occur on a specific day and at a specific time. This elixir is a celestial secret, most difficult to encounter.

Since the time of the Yellow Emperor, all *xian* who attained the Dao ingested this elixir, thereby escaping the dust and clamor to become true immortals. If, in later times, those who know their fate and study the Dao encounter a perfected being who imparts the oral instructions and successfully concoct this elixir, and further accumulate merit through cultivation, virtue, and the performance of good deeds, abandoning all false practices—when their merit and conduct are fulfilled, they may encounter this elixir.

If one does not eliminate past transgressions, calamity will arise, and all prior efforts will be destroyed. When one encounters this elixir, the Three Pure Ones, the Upper Saints, and all the divine immortals of the Caverns will immediately become aware. One must relinquish all attachments and eliminate the Three Poisons. First, one must purify the intestines and stomach. After gathering the elixir, one must prepare a secluded chamber, burn incense on all four sides, and ceaselessly bow in supplication, vowing to the Upper Clarity with utmost sincerity and without ulterior motives. Only then may one ingest it and transform the mortal body.

Ingesting one pellet dissolves ten thousand ailments; two pellets disperse throughout the entire body. Three pellets make one’s steps swift as a galloping horse; four pellets turn white hair black. Five pellets restore the aged to youth; six pellets render the countenance like that of an infant. Seven pellets grant the mind the power to arrive wherever it wills, with all spirits coming forth to welcome. Eight pellets bestow a crimson radiance upon the body, with clouds rising beneath the feet. Nine pellets transform one into a perfected immortal of the highest rank, free from all hindrances.

As for the Golden Elixir of Return, there are two kinds: internal and external. The external elixir takes the solar essence and lunar spirit as its foundation, the eastern Wood essence as its root, and the western Metal essence as its origin. From these two, the yellow sprout is born. When establishing the furnace and cauldron, one must select a site and construct an altar. Gathering the true qi into the cauldron, one proceeds from nonbeing into being. The timing of the qi must be precise: five days form one phase, three phases one qi, one month two qi, and twelve months twenty-four qi, including the midpoints of the solar terms. The methods of the new moon, full moon, first quarter, and last quarter are observed. When the elixir is successfully refined, it is wondrous indeed. Those who do not witness its completion must cultivate and nurture, for the work of harmonizing yin and yang transforms and fulfills the qi’s timing, leading to longevity. This is the verification of the external elixir.

Among all elixirs, this method is the most efficacious, which is why among ten thousand people, only a few may attain it. The internal elixir, however, employs the timing of the sun and the mechanism of the mind. One must seek with unwavering resolve, for the Dao is not distant, and the heart must not retreat. The instructions of the perfected reveal the celestial mechanism to seven-tenths. First, one employs the Three Mechanisms and the Three Vehicles. The Three Vehicles refer to the elixir’s three or four seasons and eight solar terms, where water and fire follow the patterns of heaven and earth. One opens the altar to gather the medicine, ingests it, burns incense, and petitions the Three Pure Ones, repeatedly invoking the Venerable Lord Lao, the Dipper, the sun, moon, and stars. One makes solemn vows: just as among ten thousand cultivators, it is difficult for even one to complete the work, yet through the natural accomplishment of heaven and earth, one who follows the method and ingests the elixir becomes a person of longevity.

To return this elixir, one must be utterly sincere, facing south and abandoning all worldly affairs. One must await the encounter with utmost earnestness. This elixir is only for those of true destiny who do not act carelessly, whose accumulated virtue is complete, and who must first encounter a perfected one before entering the primordial source of the undifferentiated.

This scripture enables one to comprehend the greater part of the affairs of immortals: the initial mechanism, the mechanism of life, and the celestial mechanism. There are the Upper, Middle, and Lower Vehicles, and the Nine Grades. The Nine Grades consist of three grades of the Golden Elixir, three grades of great merit, and three grades of the great medicine of the twelve teachings. The twelve teachings include three of the great Golden Medicine, three of great merit, and three of the superior vehicle, all of which are practiced in sequence. The true cause lies below.

This process proceeds from emptiness into the undifferentiated, giving birth to heaven and earth, the sun and moon, the stars, humanity, and all worlds, as well as wind, clouds, qi, seasons, and all things—all arising from the undifferentiated. "Undifferentiated" means "chaotic and turbid." Its form resembles a chicken’s egg, round above and square below. At the moment of initial division, the clear qi ascends to become heaven, and the turbid qi descends to become earth. Humanity dwells between them. In the profound obscurity, there is qi, like dust in a sunlit window—seemingly present yet without form, seemingly absent yet visible to the eye. From this presence and absence, the Two Modes are established. The Two Modes unite to produce yin and yang, and yin and yang interact to establish the Three Powers. The Three Powers divide into the Four Images, the Four Images arrange the Five Phases, and the Five Phases generate the ten thousand things.

Thus, the Three Powers are heaven, earth, and humanity, all born of the same qi. It is asked: Since humanity and heaven and earth are born of the same qi, why do heaven not collapse and earth not sink, while humanity experiences life and death? The answer: Heaven is yang qi, the light and clear qi. Beyond the light and clear, there is nothing lighter or clearer, and it dwells alone in the position of light clarity, hence it is called heaven. Earth is yin qi, the heavy and turbid qi. Beyond the heavy and turbid, there is nothing heavier or more turbid, and it dwells alone in the position of heavy turbidity, hence it is called earth. Humanity is the harmonious mean, neither turbid nor clear, neither heavy nor light. If one cultivates the conduct of light clarity, one is born and returns to heaven. If one engages in the causes of heavy turbidity, one dies and returns to earth. Thus, it is said that yang is life, and yin is death.

Heaven does not collapse because it is originally the light and clear qi, which takes form from light clarity. Its qi is purely yang, and its timing is governed solely by the movement of yang and yin. Thus, heaven endures. If, however, one were to act contrary to the qi, pursuing heavy turbidity, the qi would be exhausted, and heaven would naturally collapse. Since heaven’s origin is in light clarity, how could it return to heavy turbidity? Thus, we know heaven does not collapse. Earth does not sink because it is originally the accumulated heavy and turbid qi, which takes form from heavy turbidity. Its qi is purely yin, and its timing is governed solely by the movement of yin and yang. Thus, earth endures. If, however, one were to act contrary to the qi, pursuing light clarity, the qi would be exhausted, and earth would naturally sink. Since earth’s origin is in heavy turbidity, how could it return to light clarity? Thus, we know earth does not sink.

Humanity experiences life and death because it loses its original harmonious qi, neglects its root, and abandons its innate pure yang nature for worldly profit, scheming and toiling, exhausting the spirit and qi, and gradually scattering the essence and soul. When the qi is depleted and the essence weakened, the qi is exhausted, and death naturally follows. Humanity in the world pursues fame, sensual pleasures, profit, and reputation, scheming and coveting. All actions involving form and substance belong to yin. Human conduct is solely devoted to yin, and thus, when one’s allotted span is exhausted, one dies and returns to earth. Therefore, where there is death, there is also life. When a person dies, the Four Great Elements return to their origins, and the true qi of the Five Phases returns to its source.

Moreover, the primordial essence of humanity is transformed and formed by the true qi of the Five Phases and yin-yang. At death, it returns to the Four Great Elements, yet its true qi cannot be destroyed—it scatters and returns to its original position. This original position is the Five Viscera within the human body. Should yin and yang qi converge once more, they transform again into a person. Thus, death is the root of life, and life is the sprout of death. Where there is life, there is death; without life, there is no death.

If one aligns the original true qi with the Dao of Heaven and cultivates it without deviating from the constant measure, then virtue will harmonize with Heaven and Earth, and principle will not err—thus, there is no life or death. Without life or death, one becomes an immortal. By comprehending the celestial mechanism, one naturally transcends life and death.

**Question:** Can one seek eternal life and immortality, emulating the undying mechanism of Heaven and Earth?
**Answer:** Indeed. When yang wanes, yin is replenished; when things reach their extreme, the primordial is restored. If one grasps the root and source, the path to long life opens. But if one cultivates without relying on the root, one will wait in vain for a thousand or ten thousand ages!

Moreover, humanity exists between Heaven and Earth yet cannot emulate their enduring nature—why is this? It is because cultivation is misguided, leading one astray onto the wrong path, resulting in life and death. If one perceives the Dao of immortality, where else would there be life and death? Without birth, one is freed from death; without life or death, one attains the enduring nature of Heaven and Earth.

**Question:** What is meant by the path being correct or mistaken?
**Answer:** Most people in the world lose their original primordial qi, violate the Three Treasures, disorder their spirit and thoughts, and act contrary to regulation. Though human beings are inherently of immortal substance, they degenerate into ordinary mortals. As ordinary mortals, they have no means to attain long life and enduring vision, ultimately perishing in form—this is the great error.

If the primordial essence remains unblemished, spirit and qi unharmed, the Three Treasures distinct day and night, and the spirit-soul tranquil without worldly attachment, then one’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth, and one’s brightness equals that of the sun and moon—this is the correct path.

**Question:** If a practitioner has previously violated and harmed the primordial spirit, regardless of severity, and later encounters a perfected being who imparts the celestial mechanism, enabling cultivation according to the method—can death then be averted?
**Answer:** To violate is to harm. Having harmed the primordial spirit, the spirit is lost. With the primordial spirit lost, qi cannot be sufficient, and one naturally fails to accord with the movements of Heaven and Earth. Even if one forces cultivation, it cannot succeed.

**Question:** What if there are perfected beings who once violated the Dao but later awakened?
**Answer:** First, cultivate the body; then, nurture life—this is the true principle. To cultivate the body is to address past violations of the primordial spirit, where qi and essence are incomplete. Only after restoring true qi to fullness and spirit and qi to wholeness can one nurture life and attain immortality. If essence, qi, and spirit are insufficient yet one forcibly applies the true principle, the Dao will be difficult to achieve. For when inner and outer qi fail to harmonize, the principle is not correct.

**Question:** What does it mean for inner and outer qi to harmonize without discrepancy with Heaven and Earth?
**Answer:** Heaven and Earth are formed by a single qi, and humanity is likewise born of a single qi. Humans and Heaven and Earth share the same qi at their origin—how could inner and outer qi fail to harmonize? It is only that before awakening, one violates the primordial spirit, causing inner qi to be insufficient and thus unable to unite with outer qi. One must swiftly repair the damaged spirit and essence, restoring the lost qi to wholeness. Then, cultivating according to the original method, inner qi will naturally harmonize with outer qi.

**Question:** How does one repair a damaged human body?
**Answer:** As stated earlier: when yang wanes, yin is replenished; when things reach their extreme, the primordial is restored. All things in the world are formed without departing from metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. For example, if an object is made of wood and becomes damaged, repairing it with wood will restore it to its former state. Using metal, water, fire, or earth would be of different natures and thus ineffective.

Similarly, if an object is established from earth and becomes damaged, repairing it with earth will restore its original integrity. Using metal, wood, water, or fire would be of differing qi and thus unworkable. All things follow this principle—hence, "when things reach their extreme, the primordial is restored." For a damaged human being, one must investigate the root and replenish qi—nothing will then be lacking. Only when spirit, qi, and essence are sufficient can one nurture life and attain immortality. If spirit, qi, and essence are insufficient yet one applies the true principle, success will be difficult. Cultivating without seeing the root, acting recklessly, is like using different natures—it cannot succeed.

The root is the foundation; the foundation is the base, the very ground upon which one establishes body and life—this is the root and source. Thus, "when the root is established, the Dao arises." Furthermore, the root is the primordial; the primordial is the One. The qi of the primordial One is called the root-primordial. It is the father’s single point of true essence, transmitted to receive spirit and qi, with qi following spirit. It bears the mother’s single point of true qi. When these two qi converge, the Dao is formed—hence, "one yin and one yang is called the Dao." The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things, establishing Heaven and Earth, with nothing left unprovided.

The primordial One is the root of human life; the root is true yin and true yang. From this, humanity is born. Knowing that humans arise from yin and yang, when damage occurs and the Three Treasures are lost, one must return to the root-source of yin and yang to repair what has been lost. Then, spirit, qi, and essence will naturally be sufficient. What does this mean?

Tracing the origins of the ruined body, we see it arises from yin and yang. When destruction occurs, we now employ the qi of yin and yang to restore what was lost, so that spirit, qi, and essence may once again return to their former state. If one can make essence, qi, and spirit complete within the body, the inner qi will naturally harmonize with the outer qi. When inner and outer qi unite, one’s lifespan immediately becomes coextensive with Heaven and Earth. Further, if one knows how to nourish life and persists in cultivation, ascension to the rank of immortals will not be long in coming.

Someone asked: Though we know the ruined body arises from the two qi of yin and yang, and that we must draw upon the qi of yin and yang to cultivate the body—this principle is clear, but what is the method?

The answer: Generally speaking, in cultivating the Dao, one must first cultivate the body. Only when the body is fully cultivated can one then nourish life and attain the rank of immortals. The method of cultivating the body is a subtle and wondrous mechanism, seizing the marvelous function of immortals. This subtle mechanism secretly draws upon the true qi of yin and yang to repair the ruined body, restoring it to its root-source. When the root-source aligns perfectly with Heaven and Earth, not deviating by even a hair’s breadth, the original spirit and qi of the root-source will naturally become sufficient. Once spirit and qi are sufficient, one follows the fundamental method in cultivation and thus attains the long life of an immortal.

This fundamental method is the celestial mechanism. The celestial mechanism and its fundamental method both rely on the movement of yin and yang, grasping the qi’s seasonal cycles to act. They move Heaven and Earth, extracting and adding lead and mercury, with ingress and egress, coming and going, threading through and responding to inner and outer—allowing no error. After one year of practice, one attains spiritual penetration; after two years, one transcends the mundane; after three years, one is called an immortal.

The Dao of cultivating the body follows the patterns of yin-yang qi, the seasons, and the Five Phases—these are detailed in the lower scroll.

*End of the First Scroll of the Hunyuan Bajing Zhenjing*
*Beginning of the Second Scroll of the Hunyuan Bajing Zhenjing*

It exhorts later learners that those who grasp the principle must first cultivate the body, then nourish life, and thus inevitably attain the rank of immortals. If one’s body is not cultivated and the original qi is insufficient, even if one obtains the true principle and practices accordingly, one will still be unable to achieve it. This is because the inner qi is insufficient and does not thread through and unite with the outer qi, making the Dao difficult to attain.

Someone asked: In the above text, it speaks of "yang diminishing and yin supplementing." The original One qi—this One is the father’s single point of true essence, transmitted to receive spirit and qi, converging with the mother’s single point of true qi. When these two qi converge, form is completed. But when the two qi converge, they condense into a single pearl. From where does essence transform? From where does qi change? How do they seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth to form a human?

The answer: The father is Wood, and essence is Fire—these two images are originally one qi, with Wood as the ruler and Fire as its function. The mother is Metal, and qi is Water—Metal as the ruler and Water as its function. Father and mother, essence and qi—these four are originally the Four Images. When they encounter Earth, they generate one another; without Earth, they overcome one another.

The mother’s original palace is true Earth. When the Four Images reach this palace, they naturally harmonize and gather together as a treasure, each possessing its inherent nature to generate the faculties of intent, wisdom, and intelligence. Metal is nature, which externally establishes the West and internally generates the lung viscera; Wood is intent, which externally establishes the East and internally generates the liver viscera; Water is wisdom, which externally establishes the North and internally generates the kidney viscera; Fire is intelligence, which externally establishes the South and internally generates the heart viscera. Earth has no fixed position or form; it flourishes in the four seasons, symbolically establishing the Central Palace and internally generating the spleen viscera.

The kidneys govern bones, the liver governs sinews, the spleen governs flesh, the heart governs blood, and the lungs govern skin and hair. The liver governs the eyes, the spleen governs the lips, the lungs govern the nose, the kidneys govern the ears, and the heart governs the tongue. The gallbladder is the liver’s palace, the small intestine is the heart’s palace, the large intestine is the lung’s palace, the bladder is the kidney’s palace, and the stomach is the spleen’s palace. These five positions each occupy their proper place, with qi and function established in their respective directions, possessing the preceding spirit—thus the body is fully equipped. This is the principle by which the Five Phases generate the myriad things.

The human body’s blood, flesh, bones, marrow, skin, hair, sinews, and teeth all arise from nature, intent, wisdom, and intelligence—what does this mean? It is because they proceed from non-being into being, establishing yin and yang. Yin and yang divide into the Four Images, the Four Images enter the Center, possessing the Five Phases, and thus naturally seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth—from which the myriad things are born! If one can comprehend this and reverse the process to draw upon the true qi of yin and yang, repairing the ruined body and receiving the creative qi of the Five Phases to sufficiency, one will naturally attain the sagely rank.

Yet the human body originally proceeds from non-being into being—achieving success without effort is not easily obtained. Now, by relying on the root-source for cultivation, one transforms from the mundane to the sagely. This is indeed an achievement from being, and it is not difficult. Following the above discussion and applying the method accordingly, in thirty days the qi will be complete, in three hundred days the creative transformation will be accomplished, and the body’s form and image will be fully equipped. Once the body is thus established, spirit, qi, and essence serve as the rulers.

Spirit is the qi of Earth; qi is the qi of Metal and Water; essence is the qi of Fire and Wood. These are what the Second Scroll of the *Hunyuan Bajing Zhenjing* calls the Three Treasures: spirit, qi, and essence. They follow the mother’s nourishing and defending channels, circulating throughout the body, reaching the Central Palace’s primordial palace. From the mother, they transform into milk and descend. Within ten days, a membrane forms; on this membrane, golden liquid and white cream grow. Within thirty days, the cream overflows, surging forth to enter the primordial palace, irrigating what has gathered—spirit, qi, and essence. Within forty days, another membrane forms; by sixty days, the second membrane is complete, and the cream is full, surging forth to enter the primordial palace. The third membrane closes, retaining what has accumulated. By seventy days, the third membrane forms...

On the ninth day, the cream fills the third membrane and surges forth, flowing into the primordial palace. The fourth membrane closes, retaining what has accumulated. Thereafter, every thirty days, one membrane forms and one closes. Within three hundred days, nine membranes form and nine membranes close in succession. Only then, after three hundred days of seizing the creative power of Heaven and Earth, do blood, flesh, sinews, bones, skin, and hair all take shape. Thus, the membranes cease forming the body, and having attained completion, the child descends into the world. Then, the nine layers of accumulated milk are taken as food: one layer is consumed each year, and after three years, all nine layers are exhausted, whereupon spirit is perfected and qi is replete. Only when the body is complete and qi is full does one take the myriad flavors and five pungent foods as sustenance. These enter through the mouth, pass the Twelve-Storied Tower, and are received by the lungs, which transmit them to the kidneys. The kidneys transmit to the liver, the liver to the heart, and the heart to the spleen. The spleen, being Earth, can generate the myriad things and can also destroy them. What destroys is the elimination of the dregs of the five pungent flavors and the hundred tastes, which are transformed into urine and stool. What generates is the production of the essences of the hundred tastes and five pungent flavors, which return to the primordial palace—the very place where the father’s single drop of true essence resides, hence called the primordial palace. Located three inches below the navel, four inches in circumference, it is named the Great Sea. Within it dwells a spirit-turtle: its left nostril draws in, its right nostril expels, and from its center it takes the essences of the hundred tastes and five pungent flavors produced by the spleen’s storehouse. Once the circulation of the celestial cycles is complete, it expels them through the right nostril. From the Kan Palace, it ascends to the two orifices beneath the tongue: the left is called Jade Fluid, the right the Flowery Pond. Rising from the tongue, the essences are chewed until thick, and when the mouth is full, they are swallowed again past the Twelve-Storied Tower, where the lungs once more receive them. Passing through the spirit-turtle of the primordial palace and completing the celestial cycles, they no longer circulate through the various viscera but are transmitted solely to the heart. The heart has three hairs and seven apertures, with another cavity called the Saliva-Gathering Cavity. Within it are three orifices: the essences are transmitted from the central orifice, irrigating the entire body and cleansing the five viscera. The left orifice governs the nourishing qi, the right the defending qi—together called nourishing and defending, also known as Dragon and Tiger, or the blood vessels within the human center. These blood vessels traverse beneath the skin, and once the celestial cycles are complete, they transform into blood. Within blood, blood transforms into flesh; within flesh, flesh into sinews; within sinews, sinews into bones; within bones, bones into marrow; and the movement of marrow becomes essence. All that emerges from the Twelve-Storied Tower in front and from above the Great Harmony Jade Pillow in the nine palaces behind is essence, while within the three hundred and sixty joints below is marrow. Just as the movement of yin and yang must first stir the spirit, then the qi, and only afterward the essence, the descent of essence allows yin and yang to unite—this is the root of life. One who comprehends this mechanism and cultivates accordingly grasps the essentials of true refinement.

Someone asked: The above text speaks of the initial reception of a single drop of true qi from one’s parents, with qi being complete in thirty days, and then states that only after three hundred days of creative transformation is the body fully formed and the child born into the world, sustained by the power of golden liquid and white cream. Having carefully considered this, I wonder: if qi is complete in thirty days, how does this foundational creative work function? What is the method of the three-hundred-day transformation? And afterward, for three years, from where is the golden liquid and white cream obtained?

The answer: When Heaven and Earth were yet undivided, they received the true qi of the Great Dao and entered the Middle Origin. First, yin and yang were separated; next, the Three Powers were established; then the Four Images were distinguished, followed by the Five Phases, the Six Pitches, the Seven Qi, the Eight Trigrams, and the Nine Palaces. The myriad phenomena took shape, the sun and moon were employed to divide day and night, and within the hundred divisions of the twelve hours, the water clock was used as the standard. All these processes—qi being complete in thirty days and the body fully formed in three hundred—are of the Dao itself. From seconds to minutes, minutes to divisions, divisions to hours, hours to days, days to seasons, seasons to solar terms, and solar terms to years—all are firmly established, with the water clock as the standard. When a person first receives the true qi of their parents at the Cavity of Intercourse, it is identical to the creative work of Heaven and Earth: qi is complete in thirty days, and by subtly seizing the three-hundred-day transformation of Heaven and Earth, the body is fully formed. The white cream and golden liquid are the accumulated substances of these three hundred days. One who comprehends this mechanism and cultivates accordingly may become an immortal. The methods of the thirty-day qi-condensing work and the three-hundred-day transformation are fully expounded in the lower scroll, which contains these profound mysteries. Now that they have been briefly outlined, let them be discussed in detail according to the method.

For those who have previously damaged the Three Treasures, leaving their original spirit incomplete, the middle scroll first discusses cultivating the body and nurturing life, replenishing qi and perfecting spirit—this is the subtle mechanism by which Heaven and Earth generate human life. Thus, this method is provided in the lower scroll. Future scholars should first cultivate the body, then nurture life; if the work is not deficient, there will be no failure. Those who attain this must guard against lightly revealing the celestial mysteries. If carelessly disclosed, calamity will swiftly follow, and one will forever sink among the lower ghosts. Treasure and cherish this—do not reveal it to the unworthy. Take heed! Be cautious!

**Completion of the Second Scroll of the Hunyuan Eight Radiant Perfections Classic**

**The Third Scroll of the Hunyuan Eight Radiant Perfections Classic**

The Perfected of Hunyuan said: In the questions and answers thus far, the principles expounded cannot be fully exhausted in words. To summarize them would risk obscuring their meaning for learners. Therefore, I have discussed the root and origin together, posing questions to prompt reflection. The celestial mysteries, the great work, the great elixir, and the refined methods of golden cinnabar are all contained within these five sections.

**Question:** The preceding text speaks of dissolving yang to replenish yin and supplementing at the point of extremity, urging one to seek the root diligently and cultivate according to the original source.

Yet we observe that all things in the world—sentient and insentient, including humans—arise from formlessness to form, from immateriality to substance. Once form and substance are complete, they subtly draw upon the qi of Heaven and Earth and the Five Phases, employing it within the body. Thus, the body is perfected and qi is whole. Yet they are later assailed by the reversal of yin-yang and the Five Phases, which disrupt their qi, causing them to act contrary to the Dao of Heaven. Gradually, this leads to decay and ruin. What is the meaning of this?

**Answer:** Know that among the myriad things of the world, none can be called long without something longer to follow, nor short without something shorter to precede. Thus, length and shortness, height and lowness, each has its proper place. When a thing reaches its proper place, it is called "settled." If it remains settled without cultivation for long, it is called "extreme." If it remains extreme without cultivation for long, it must inevitably lead to destruction.

When destruction arrives, one must cultivate the root source, returning to the original foundation. Only then can one harmonize with Heaven and Earth. Moreover, though the myriad things possess form and substance, they lack spiritual penetration and thus cannot attain this state. Among all things, only humans are most noble and most spiritually endowed. Yet when they fall into ruin, they allow their forms to perish of their own accord, failing to seek out the root source and cultivate the body. How much less can other kinds of beings do so?

I now leave this text in the world so that later generations may know the path to longevity and the gate to immortality. If one cultivates according to this method, none will fail to attain the state of divine transcendence.

**Question:** In the previous scroll, it was said that those who have previously damaged their original qi cannot harmonize with the movements of Heaven and Earth. They must first cultivate the body and then nurture life, thoroughly investigating the root source and acting according to the original foundation. None will fail to attain the principle. What does this mean?

**Answer:** In cultivating the body, one must perceive the true qi of the Dao of Heaven and its movements and patterns. The true qi of the Dao of Heaven gathers and disperses, comes and goes. The true qi of humans is likewise. When a person is first born, they subtly harmonize with the patterns of Heaven and Earth. The true qi of humans also gathers and disperses, comes and goes. When it gathers, the original palace becomes the treasure; when it disperses, it becomes qi throughout the body.

If one wishes to cultivate the body, one must align with the qi and seasons of Heaven and Earth. Naturally, there will be verification. If one does not perceive the patterns of Heaven and Earth, even if one cultivates the root source, success will often elude them. This is because the true qi gathers and disperses, comes and goes unpredictably. The refined details are contained in the later scroll.

In cultivating the body, one must first eliminate illness. Without illness, the body is at peace; when the body is at peace, the spirit is tranquil. If the body suffers, the spirit is disturbed. When the body is afflicted, the spirit naturally cannot be tranquil. If one’s own body and spirit cannot be at peace, how can one draw in external qi to harmonize with internal qi? How can one attain verification?

First, ensure the body is free of illness, then cultivate according to the method. Naturally, there will be verification. Human illnesses all arise from disharmony among the Five Viscera and obstruction in the constructive and defensive qi, leading to the onset of afflictions. First, cultivate the body to make its qi flow smoothly. When qi flows smoothly, the spirit is luminous. Then, harmonize the Five Viscera and regulate the constructive and defensive qi, allowing qi to come and go without deficiency or stagnation. When qi flows smoothly, the Five Viscera generate one another; when qi is reversed, the Five Viscera overcome one another. When qi flows smoothly, illness naturally disappears; when qi is reversed, illness arises even where there was none.

When the qi of the Five Viscera flows smoothly, the constructive and defensive qi circulate throughout the body without stagnation. When the qi of the Five Viscera is reversed, the hundred vessels all stagnate, and the constructive and defensive qi cannot circulate. Thus, the spirit is disturbed, and the qi of the spirit throughout the body is likewise chaotic. How then can one draw in external spirit-qi?

I have now fully set forth the principles of descending qi and eliminating illness, which are recorded in detail below.

**Method:** Observe the time precisely, without error in the clepsydra, and then begin the practice. First, guide and stretch the limbs and meridians, then extend the hands and feet to open all joints. Next, shake the entire body to allow qi to come and go without stagnation.

If the learner has encountered an enlightened teacher, they will know that the three periods of *xu*, *hai*, and *zi* are the times for applying the practice. Therefore, one should settle into stillness. Once settled, yin qi naturally flourishes. When yin qi flourishes, one falls into slumber. When one sleeps outside the bed and pillow, the qi and vessels stagnate in the hundred joints. Thus, first guide the qi to ensure it flows without stagnation, then apply the practice. The spirit will naturally become luminous!

The term "spirit-luminosity" refers to the unfathomable workings of yin and yang as "spirit" and the clarity of the sun and moon as "luminosity." Initiating intention and movement is called "spirit"; precise application without error is called "luminosity." When one lives in the world, regardless of great or small matters, all one seeks will be attained—this is the use of spirit-luminosity. If what one seeks is not attained, it is because the use of spirit is not luminous. If what one seeks is not attained, it is because the use of spirit is not spirit-like, hence not luminous. When spirit is not luminous, it is because one’s mechanisms are not subtle and wondrous. If one’s mechanisms are subtle and wondrous, the myriad spirits all become luminous, and the myriad affairs all come to fruition. No intention will fail to be realized. When intention is realized, it is called spirit-luminosity.

If one wishes to employ spirit-luminosity, one must first use the spirit. Sit upright and composed, free from thoughts and worries. Wait until spirit and qi are both settled, then inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.

Inhaling through the nose draws in pure qi; exhaling through the mouth expels turbid qi. The myriad flavors and five pungent foods that one consumes all bear mutual restraint and harm, corroding the five viscera and giving rise to ailments. When the pure is mixed with the turbid, the pure becomes obscured—hence the need to expel the turbid qi through exhalation. Once the turbid is fully expelled, allow the heart-qi to enter and exit solely through the nose. The qi that moves in and out through the nose is light and pure, and the light and pure qi is yang. The qi that moves in and out through the mouth is heavy and turbid, and the heavy and turbid qi is yin.

The nose is the Gate of Heaven; the mouth is the Door of Earth. The mouth connects to the five viscera, and what issues from the five viscera is nothing but foul and turbid qi. The nose connects to the six bowels, and what issues from the six bowels is nothing but light and pure qi. The paths of pure and turbid are distinct, each following its own course. Thus, allow only the qi in the nose to come and go, lest the turbid qi contaminate the pure. When drawing qi through the nose, it must be slow and continuous, so subtle that the ear cannot perceive it—this is the essential subtlety. Let the light and pure qi circulate through the five viscera, nourishing the constructive and protective qi to permeate the entire body, opening the four limbs and all joints, dissolving stagnation, and ensuring unimpeded flow.

If the qi flows freely in and out through the Gate of Heaven, it cannot traverse the hundred passages and limb-joints. Therefore, the in-and-out flow must be continuous and unbroken. Once the turbid has been fully expelled, close the Door of Earth and leave open the Gate of Heaven, allowing spirit and qi to guard each other, embracing only the primordial yang—this is the Way of Guarding the One. Wait until the hundred vessels and bone-joints are unobstructed, all joints open, and the flow smooth and unimpeded. Then take the refined essence of the myriad flavors and five pungent foods, refine it into spirit-water, and replenish the primordial palace as treasure—this is the principle of withdrawal and replenishment.

To "take" means to draw the essence of the myriad flavors and five pungent foods generated by the spleen-viscera, guiding the true qi of primordial yang so that spirit and qi follow the constructive and protective qi in circulation. From the spine’s pass, it ascends to the front of the brain, reaching the crown of the head before returning downward. The true qi descends into the mouth, where it is rinsed and swallowed, entering the twelve-storied tower (the throat), passing into the lungs, then transmitted to the kidneys, from the kidneys to the liver, from the liver to the heart, and from the heart to the spleen. What the spleen receives is free from the harm of mutual restraint. All things are generated, entering the primordial palace to nourish the spirit-tortoise. The spirit-tortoise then produces white cinnabar, which ascends to the tongue and undergoes the threefold generation and restraint of the five phases. The five phases’ generation and restraint transform into spirit-water, which, through three and five refinements, becomes a treasure. No longer transmitted to the viscera, it is conveyed solely to the heart.

The heart has three hairs and seven orifices, with another cavity called the Saliva-Gathering Cavity. It has three orifices, and the saliva is transmitted from the central orifice to the left and right orifices of the viscera, then distributed into the skin, transforming into constructive and protective qi. When the circulation of the celestial cycle is complete, it transforms into blood; blood into flesh, flesh into sinews, sinews into bones, bones into marrow, and marrow into essence. Refined and returned to the primordial palace as treasure, this is the true One—gold within water. This gold undergoes three cycles of the five phases’ generation and restraint, hence called the Three-Five-One. Refined into a single qi, it is thus named the One.

Moreover, three represents wood, corresponding to spring, when all things arise. Wood is yang, Heaven. Five represents earth, from which all things are born. Earth is yin, Earth. The essence of wood-qi refines within earth, and earth refines the essence of wood into the supreme treasure—this is the Three-Five-One. The Three-Five-One is the subtle mechanism of Heaven and Earth, the wondrous principle of bodily generation. One who grasps this mechanism can transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, ascending to the immortal realms.

**Question:** How does one investigate the establishment of the human body, which originates from the formless and imageless? From whence does it arise?

**Answer:** It arises from the union of dragon and tiger, the merging of lead and mercury—no small matter. The great Dao of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things is completed through the mutual resonance of qi in the central origin, forming the bodily structure. As for the root origin of dragon and tiger, within the six directions, nothing exists apart from this. One who grasps this true root origin sees the path to immortality as clearly as the palm of one’s hand.

Moreover, the dragon generates mercury, and the tiger generates lead. When true lead and true mercury subdue each other, the Dao aligns naturally. Simply follow the method of lead and mercury in cultivation, and there will be no deviation. The explanations of dragon, tiger, lead, and mercury will be expounded below.

**Question:** I wish to hear the wondrous principle of purifying the true.

**Answer:** The preceding text urges one to investigate the root origin and cultivate according to the original source. Now, humans are transformed from the true qi of father and mother. Wood is the father of humans; earth is the mother. The true qi of father and mother transforms and becomes human—this is the Three-Five-One, the true root origin of bodily existence. Simply ensure the five viscera are in harmony, the constructive and protective qi flow smoothly, and all illnesses are absent. Thereafter, cultivate the body, and there will be no deviation.

**Question:** Since humans are transformed from the true qi of father and mother, subtly seizing the creative power of Heaven and Earth to become human, why not cultivate according to the original root origin? Instead, one seizes the true qi of yin and yang, the creative power of Heaven and Earth, to refine the body—thereby attaining immortality without fail. Further, when investigating the root origin of bodily form, all structures are complete, and after three hundred days of qi sufficiency, one descends into the world as a human infant. East and west are not yet distinguished, nor south and north separated. By what method is the body established? By what qi is it nourished?

**Answer:** The infant is free from thought and worry, attachment and desire. Beyond hunger and cold, there is nothing else. Thus, spirit is settled and qi is tranquil, gradually attaining extraordinary sageliness to establish the body.

This is the method: to obtain qi is to receive the qi of the mother’s accumulated milk. Humans fundamentally emerge from the yin and yang qi, and these two qi constitute the Four Images. One qi generates the Two Images, the Two Images generate the Four Images, which intermingle within the Central Palace, thus completing the Five Phases. The Five Phases gather together to seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth, forming a human. Within thirty days, the world of Qian and Kun is established. Beneath the mother’s twin breasts, the golden fluid essence is produced, taken as nourishment, while the remainder accumulates in the stored milk. Over three hundred days, the stored milk forms nine layers. Upon descending into the world, one must consume this stored milk’s qi, which naturally fosters growth.

If a practitioner comprehends the great work of Heaven and Earth’s creation over three hundred days and cultivates according to this original method, they will naturally attain the state of immortality, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness. Should one wish to refine the body, they must first follow this method to harmonize the qi, eliminating all illnesses before proceeding to refine the body. In refining the body, how could one forget the original foundation?

All the subtle and wondrous techniques of refining the body and gathering qi are profound mysteries, which will be expounded in later volumes.

**Question:** The preceding text states that for ordinary people seeking to nourish life, one must first refine the body, eliminate illness, and transform saliva into divine water, then refine this divine water into treasure. This treasure is the medicine; when the original palace contains medicine, illness naturally vanishes, and one may proceed to refine the saliva accordingly. Yet saliva cannot become divine water, nor can divine water become the supreme treasure—only when the method is incorrect or the effort misapplied.

**Answer:** The method is never incorrect, nor is the effort misapplied. It is merely that the true qi of the Five Viscera has not yet harmonized, leading to such outcomes. One must first regulate the true qi of the Five Viscera to ensure their harmony. Once the true qi of the Five Viscera is harmonized, the saliva can be refined three times into divine water, and the divine water further refined into medicine. If the qi of the Five Viscera rebels against the constructive and defensive qi, it cannot flow smoothly—how much less can one refine qi into treasure?

**Question:** How can the qi of the Five Viscera be harmonized? I wish to hear the essential method.

**Answer:** Internally, there are the Five Viscera; externally, the Five Phases. By investigating the foundational mechanism of the Five Phases and cultivating the Five Viscera according to this principle, they will naturally harmonize. The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.

Wood resides in the positions of Jia and Yi, purely following the Yang path. It is born from Bing Yin, governed by the trigram Zhen, and its image is the Azure Dragon. It is said to receive qi from Water, hence its image as the Azure Dragon. Its qi number is nine times nine; when qi is sufficient, it generates Fire. Its governance lies in Bing and Ding, with Fire’s number being two, governed by the trigram Li, its image the Vermilion Bird—a Yin within Li, which receives the qi of the Azure Dragon. These Two Images are but one qi: Wood is the essence, Fire the function.

Metal resides in the western positions of Geng and Xin, purely following the Yin path. It is born from Ren Shen, governed by the trigram Dui, and its image is the White Tiger. It receives qi from Earth, hence its image as the Tiger. Its qi number is seven; when seven qi are sufficient, they unite to form Water. Its governance lies in Ren and Gui, with Water’s qi number being five, governed by the trigram Kan, its image the Dark Warrior—a Yang within Kan, which receives the essence of the White Tiger. These Two Images are but one qi: Metal is the essence, Water the function.

When Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire form the Four Images, they generate one another in the presence of Earth but overcome one another in its absence. Earth resides in the central positions of Wu and Ji, the imperial throne. Earth’s number is five, possessing the Five Virtues. It flourishes in the four seasons, resolves the constraints of the Four Images, and its qi can give life to or destroy all things. Thus, Earth is the chief of the Five Phases.

The Five Phases emerge from Yin and Yang, and how could the Five Viscera of humans be separate from what their parents have bestowed? One’s original endowment from the parents’ essence and blood, when the two qi intermingle, is governed by Earth to form the body. The father’s essence is true Wood-Fire, the mother’s blood is true Metal-Water. The mother’s original palace is true Earth. Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, governed by Earth, cannot dissipate; each retains its nature, generating the faculties of intent, wisdom, and perception, thus possessing the Four Images. These are aligned with the center to establish the Five Phases. The Five Phases are the Five Viscera, which can then generate the myriad things. The myriad things are the human’s sinews, bones, skin, hair, and the ten thousand spirits—thus, all are complete to form a human.

If one can reverse and seize the true qi of Yin and Yang, uniting with the creative power to refine the body, how could one not become an immortal? The above is a brief explanation of the positions attained by the Five Viscera. By cultivating according to this foundation, the Five Viscera will naturally harmonize, illness will vanish, and once free of disease, one may refine the body. Once the body attains Metal, one may then nourish life—there is no failure in attaining immortality.

**Question:** The root source of the Five Phases has been detailed, but what is the method for refining the Five Viscera?

**Answer:** To refine the true qi of the Five Viscera, one must grasp the essence of the Five Phases. Without precise study, effort is wasted, and success remains unattainable. The true essence of the Five Phases can be verified within the nine orifices, and nothing deviates from this principle.

How is this known? The Five Viscera externally connect to the nine orifices: the liver to the two eyes, the heart to the tongue, the spleen to the mouth, the lungs to the nose, the kidneys to the ears and the two lower yin orifices—together forming the nine orifices. If the nine orifices are obstructed, it indicates the Five Viscera are not harmonized. When the Five Viscera are at peace and the qi flows without obstruction, the nine orifices are all unobstructed. Without blockage, there is no illness; without illness, there is no death; without death, there is longevity. This is the verification through the nine orifices.

Moreover, to verify whether the Five Viscera harbor illness, observe the qi signs through their respective inherent colors—this is the method of verification.

For instance, the liver manifests as green, the heart as red, the lungs as white, the kidneys as black, and the spleen as yellow. When the qi of the Five Viscera is refined to its inherent color and appears upon the face, this is conclusive verification.

Take the liver, for example: its qi corresponds to the east, the celestial stems *jia* and *yi*, and the Wood phase, its color being green. By applying the liver’s unique method of cultivation without allowing the qi of the other viscera to intermingle, upon completion of the practice, one examines the result—only the green color appears, with no trace of other hues. This signifies the harmonious flow of the liver’s qi. The remaining four viscera follow the same principle.

Once the cultivation for each of the Five Viscera is complete, verify the qi signs of each. If a viscus fails to manifest its proper color, it indicates disharmony. If it appears in its inherent color, harmony is achieved.

Through such precise verification of the Five Viscera’s qi signs, hunger and cold become inconsequential. At this stage, if even hunger and cold cannot affect one, how much less could external pathogens, wind-stroke, or any other malign influence cause illness? With no illness, death has no entry, and without death, there is longevity.

This is the method of verifying the Five Viscera. For later learners, if one can harmonize the qi of the Five Viscera and attain conclusive verification, one becomes an Earthly Immortal.

*End of Scroll Three of the* Hunyuan Bajing Zhenjing
*Scroll Four of the* Hunyuan Bajing Zhenjing

**The Three Mechanisms**

**The Initial Mechanism**
The method of the Initial Mechanism comprises five sections, discussing yin-yang, the Three Origins, Four Images, Five Phases’ generative and fulfilled numbers, qi numerology and qi signs, divided into three grades, and the convergence of internal and external, reverse and顺.

**The Mechanism of Destiny**
The method of the Mechanism of Destiny comprises eight sections, expounding on the true qi of Greater Yin and Greater Yang, its daily descent and hourly movements, gathering and dispersion, going and abiding, interpenetration and internal-external application, the circulation of elixir and medicinal efficacy, and the sequential transformations of creation.

**The Celestial Mechanism**
The method of the Celestial Mechanism comprises five sections, discussing the establishment of altars in accordance with texts, the division of symbolic time by clepsydra, the determination of the conjunctions and separations of the sun and moon, the waxing and waning crescents, new and full moons, and the transitions of the four seasons. Five days make one qi sign, forty-five days one seasonal node, ninety days one seasonal period, with internal and external practices converging in cultivation. In total, these comprise eighteen sections.

The method of the Initial Mechanism pertains to the Three Vehicles’ Dao, which encompasses three vehicles and nine grades, each with distinct paths of emergence.

**The Upper Vehicle’s Three Grades**
Practicing the embrace of the One and preservation of the center—none other than the golden elixir of Dragon Mercury and Tiger Lead.

**The Middle Vehicle’s Three Grades**
Practicing the divine water of the Flower Pool—none other than the great medicine of Tiger Lead and Dragon Mercury.

**The Lower Vehicle’s Three Grades**
Practicing the circulation of essence, absorption of qi—none other than the great achievement of Qian Mercury and Kun Lead.

The nine grades above establish the foundation of embodied existence, all formed from Lead and Mercury. Lead and Mercury are the ancestral origin of heaven, earth, and the myriad things.

Moreover, Mercury originates from Wood, being Wood’s essence. Lead arises from White Metal, being Metal’s qi. Wood is the Dragon; Metal is the Tiger. An ancient immortal song says:
*If one recognizes Metal’s essence, one attains longevity.
Metal’s essence is Lead; with Mercury, the elixir is formed.
When Lead and Mercury unite, immortality may be sought.
When Lead and Mercury congeal, the Dao is without fail.*
*Should one encounter true Lead, one may extend one’s years.*
It is also said:
*If a lesser adept grasps true Lead and Mercury,
they shall traverse myriad springs and autumns.*
Thus, without Lead and Mercury, nothing can be established. Lead and Mercury are true Yin and true Yang—only then is it the true Dao.

**Chapter on the Great Achievement of the Lower Vehicle’s Three Grades: Qian Mercury and Kun Lead**
Qian Mercury is the father’s essence; Kun Lead is the mother’s qi. The two qi subtly converge, the mechanism of yin-yang union seizing creation to form a human.

Moreover, the father is Wood; essence is Fire. The mother is Metal; qi is Water. Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire are the Four Images, governed by Earth, converging as treasure. Their number fills twenty-four qi, circulating with the constructive and protective qi throughout the body, completing ninety-six cycles daily. Their number further fills three hundred eighty-four, and when yin and yang qi are sufficient, this accords with thirty days of qi completion and three hundred days of bodily formation, descending into the world as a human.

If one can reverse and employ the two qi that gave birth to the body, applying them to oneself, seizing heaven and earth’s creation, receiving the fullness of yin-yang qi numerology, one transforms from the ordinary to the sagely—hence the great achievement of Qian Mercury and Kun Lead.

The great achievement lies in this: humans are formed by the union of Qian Mercury and Kun Lead’s two qi; now, by refining Qian Mercury and Kun Lead in accordance with creation, when qi is full, it is called the *Divine Talisman*. When the Divine Talisman’s qi is complete, it is called *White Snow*. When White Snow’s qi is complete, it reverts to Qian Mercury and Kun Lead, entering the supreme Dao—hence the great achievement.

If, from birth, one’s original spirit remains unviolated, spirit and qi intact, grasping the mechanism of great achievement and completing cultivation, this is the upper grade of the Lower Vehicle, dwelling in the world as an immortal. If one has violated it in middle age, one may attain half the mechanism of great achievement; completing cultivation, this is the middle grade of the Lower Vehicle, dwelling in the world as an Earthly Immortal. If, in extreme old age, two-thirds of one’s spirit and qi are violated, yet one attains the initial mechanism of great achievement and completes cultivation, this is the lower grade of the Lower Vehicle, attaining the fullness of ordinary longevity and shedding the mortal coil to become an Earthly Immortal. These are the three grades of the Lower Vehicle.

**Chapter on the Great Medicine of the Middle Vehicle’s Three Grades: Tiger Lead and Dragon Mercury**
Tiger Lead is the true qi of the White Tiger. The White Tiger is Metal; Metal is Yin; Yin is true Yin. Moreover, Lead is the substance in which the White Tiger’s true qi gathers—hence Tiger Lead.

Dragon Mercury is the true essence of the Azure Dragon. The Azure Dragon is Wood; Wood is Yang; Yang is true Yang. Moreover, Mercury is the substance formed by the Azure Dragon’s true essence and qi—hence Dragon Mercury.

When Dragon Mercury and Tiger Lead unite, receiving Earth’s nurturance, three hundred days of creation yield the Yellow Sprout. Once the Yellow Sprout’s qi is complete, one transforms from the ordinary to the sagely—hence the great medicine.

For example, the Dragon and Mercury: the Dragon pertains to Wood, Mercury to Fire. Fire’s qi number fills three; Wood’s qi number fills nine—three and nine together make twelve. The Tiger and Lead: the Tiger pertains to Metal, Lead to Water. Metal’s qi number fills seven; Water’s qi number fills five—five and seven together make twelve. The qi of the Four Images totals twenty-four, corresponding to one month’s use.

Moreover, the Dragon’s position is at *mao* (Wood), the Tiger’s at *you* (Metal). The *mao-you* positions: Metal’s seven qi and Wood’s nine qi combine to make sixteen, corresponding to one *jin*’s use. *Mao* is Wood, Wood is Yang; *you* is Metal, Metal is Yin. Within Yin are three Yang spirits—spirit, qi, and essence. Within Yang are three Yin spirits—spirit, qi, and essence. Three Yang and three Yin together make six spirits. The external image corresponds to the six lines of the hexagrams, pairing Metal and Wood’s two qi to form the eight nodes and eight trigrams. Each trigram further generates eight trigrams, totaling sixty-four hexagrams. Proceeding accordingly, mutual generation and union give rise to three hundred eighty-four lines, governing the body’s spirits.

Once the above is generated, the spirits are sufficient for the body, which then has its own master—hence the Great Elixir is called "Tiger Lead and Dragon Mercury." Now, the Great Elixir is the true *qi* of Grand Yin, the mother of all things. All beings in the world are born without departing from this mother *qi*, thus subtly seizing the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth and the mechanism of their union. Furthermore, when the true *qi* of Grand Yin combines with the true *qi* of Grand Yang, their union receives the nurturing *qi* of the Central True Earth, and when the *qi* is complete, it is called the "Yellow Sprout." When the *qi* of the Yellow Sprout is complete, it is called the Great Elixir. If one’s original self remains untainted, with spirit and *qi* intact, and grasps the mechanism of the Great Elixir, the work of cultivation is perfected—this is the upper grade of the Middle Vehicle, known as the Upper Immortal of the Middle Vehicle. If one has transgressed by middle age but still attains half the mechanism of the Great Elixir, the work of cultivation perfected is the middle grade of the Middle Vehicle, known as the Divine Immortal of the Middle Vehicle. If one is extremely aged and has transgressed two-thirds before grasping the mechanism of the Great Elixir, the work of cultivation perfected is the lower grade of the Middle Vehicle, known as the Earthly Immortal of Longevity. These are the three grades of the Middle Vehicle.

**Chapter on the Three Grades of the Upper Vehicle’s Dragon Lead and Tiger Mercury**

Dragon Lead: The Dragon inherently has no lead; it arises from the Tiger. It takes the true lead of the White Tiger and returns it to the original palace of the Azure Dragon, where Yin and Yang intersect. When the fire-phase is applied and the *qi* is sufficient, it transforms into the Mysterious Pearl. Though this pearl is formed from the *qi* of the Four Images, its singular body cannot yet transform. It re-enters the original palace of the White Tiger to be nurtured—hence it is called Dragon Lead.

Tiger Mercury: The Tiger inherently has no mercury; it is born from the Dragon. First, the true lead of the White Tiger is taken to subdue the true mercury of the Azure Dragon. Once the Dragon’s mercury is restrained by the Tiger’s lead, the *qi* of Yin and Yang is complete. It then re-enters the original palace of the White Tiger—hence it is called Tiger Mercury.

Moreover, the twenty-four *qi* of these two combine with the Four Images, completing the twenty-four spiritual lights. The Mysterious Pearl, already possessing the twenty-four *qi*, re-enters the original palace of the White Tiger and gains another twenty-four *qi*, thus receiving the irrigation of the Four Images twice. With the transformations of the Five Phases complete, the *qi* is perfected—this is called the Golden Elixir. Whoever attains it becomes a Heavenly Immortal; this is the supreme path of Divine Immortals—hence the Golden Elixir of Dragon Lead and Tiger Mercury.

Now, the initial Golden Elixir is the true *qi* of Grand Yang, which, when bound and subdued by true lead, completes the *qi* to form the Mysterious Pearl. It then re-enters the original palace of the White Tiger. Since metal is generated by *qi*, it is called the Golden Elixir, also known as "Gold in Water." After three hundred days of transformation, it becomes as large as a cherry, its color like fresh blood, radiant with a crimson-purple glow. As it is produced from metal, it is called the Golden Elixir. Whoever obtains this elixir: the highest is the Heavenly Immortal of the Upper Vehicle, the middle is the Divine Immortal of the Middle Vehicle, and the lowest is the Great Immortal of the Lower Vehicle. If one employs all three grades of lead and mercury in cultivation and perfects the work, transcending the Three Vehicles, one’s rank reaches the Upper Realm, known as the Perfected Lord. The highest is the Upper Perfected Lord of the Upper Clarity, the middle is the Middle Perfected Lord of the Upper Clarity, and the lowest is the Lower Perfected Lord of the Upper Clarity. An inferior practitioner who attains the lead of the Three Vehicles may live through countless springs and autumns. The Three Vehicles above are divided into nine grades, and transcending the Vehicles further divides into three ranks, totaling twelve. Thus, there are twelve divisions, entering into the principle of Qian Mercury and Kun Lead.

**Chapter on the Integration of Yin-Yang, Three Origins, Four Images, Five Phases, and the Principles of Qi and Numerical Cycles**

In practice, one must align with the internal and external *qi*-phases, ensuring no deviation in application—there is nothing that cannot be achieved. The Yin number is one hundred ninety-two, the Yang number is one hundred ninety-two, totaling three hundred eighty-four. The Three Origins—Heaven, Earth, and Human—each occupy thirty-six, totaling one hundred eight. Adding the Four Images—Metal (seven), Water (five), Wood (nine), and Fire (three)—yields twenty-four. Including the *qi*-number of the Central Palace’s Earth (five), and multiplying the Four Images by five to enter the Central Palace, the total is one hundred twenty.

As for the *qi*-phases: when Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, unite and the *qi*-phases are applied, the *qi* circulates throughout the body and rains down, then ascends from the original palace to the tongue, filling the mouth with saliva—this is one *qi*-phase. This occurs because the spleen first governs the generation and destruction of the five flavors and pungent substances. "Destruction" eliminates the turbid dregs, which enter the two excretory pathways; "generation" produces the five flavors and pungent fluids, which enter the original palace. The Spirit Turtle receives them, and from the left nostril, it gathers the five flavors and pungent fluids, circulating them through the celestial cycle. When sufficient, they exit the right nostril from the Kan Palace, ascending to the two orifices beneath the tongue, where saliva fills the mouth—this is called one *qi*-phase. If forcibly rinsed, the palace *qi* will be incomplete and fail to enter the original palace, resulting in insufficient *qi*—thus one must understand the *qi*-phases. By practicing according to the method, the numbers of Yin-Yang, Three Origins, Four Images, and Five Phases will be complete—nothing will be unattainable.

When the mouth is full of saliva, swallow it down the Twelve-Storied Tower, where the lungs first receive it. The lungs are the mother of all things, and all things are born from the mother’s *qi*—thus it is first transmitted to the lungs. The lungs are the proper *qi* of the West, with a generative number of four; multiplied by the Five Phases, it becomes nine *qi*, with a numerical value of seven. The *qi*-phase circulates seven cycles to the kidneys. The kidneys are the proper *qi* of the North, with a generative number of one; multiplied, it becomes six *qi*, with a numerical value of five. It circulates five cycles to the liver. The liver is the proper *qi* of the East, with a generative number of three; multiplied, it becomes eight *qi*, with a numerical value of nine. It circulates nine cycles to the heart. The heart is Fire, the proper *qi* of the South, with a generative number of two; multiplied, it becomes seven *qi*, with a numerical value of three. It circulates three cycles to the spleen. This is the natural Dao of mother-child transmission.

When the Four Symbols complete twenty-four *qi*, with a numerical value of five, and the five breaths summon the Four Symbols, all enter the Central Palace, receiving the *qi* of the Five Phases—this is called "one cycle of the heavens." Whenever circulating the *qi* of the Four Symbols, one must follow the method of *qi*-circulation: first close all six gates, wait until the limit of endurance is reached, then exert force to swallow, dividing each swallow into three gulps, guiding the *qi* directly to the Primordial Palace, where the divine tortoise inhales through the left nostril. Then, once the breath is even, visualize the divine tortoise exhaling through the right nostril, dispersing the *qi* throughout the body, ascending to the tongue’s underside, passing through the double gates of the spine, and reaching the brain. Returning, swallow again, hold the breath until the limit of endurance, then swallow once more, guiding it as before to the Primordial Palace, where the divine tortoise inhales through the left nostril. This is called "directing *qi*," also known as "circulating fire," or "activating the constructive and defensive *qi*."

Whenever one wishes to circulate *qi*, one must first circulate fire. For example, when beginning, the lungs first circulate fire once, allowing the lung *qi* to penetrate all joints and limbs without exception. After the lungs complete seven cycles, fire is circulated once more to connect with the kidney’s *qi*. After the kidneys complete five cycles, fire is circulated again to connect with the liver’s *qi*. After the liver completes nine cycles, fire is circulated once more to connect with the heart’s *qi*. After the heart completes three cycles, fire is circulated five times in accordance with the method, and the Four Symbols all receive the great harmony of the Central Palace, thus fulfilling the generative and transformative numbers of the Four Symbols and Five Phases—this is called "a cycle of the heavens." When the Four Symbols are complete and the *qi* of yin and yang are full, they enter the chapter of the transformative *qi* of creation.

When the Four Symbols are complete with twenty-four *qi*, follow the proper timing and method to circulate sixteen cycles of the heavens, totaling three hundred eighty-four, fulfilling the numerical completion of yin and yang *qi*, harmonizing internally and externally. The foundational principle of the body’s creation and transformation originates from the undivided state of heaven and earth, born of yin and yang, and likewise existing through yin and yang. Now that the *qi* of yin and yang is complete and full, what concern is there that the body lacks mastery? With the body thus mastered, longevity is natural.

Moreover, yin and yang establish the Three Powers, divide into the Four Symbols; the Four Symbols arrange the Five Phases, the Five Phases generate the six pitch-pipes, the six pitch-pipes divide into the seven governances, the seven governances transform into the eight trigrams, and the eight trigrams evolve into sixty-four hexagrams. Each hexagram divides into six line-spirits, totaling three hundred eighty-four line-spirits, which supplement the fullness of yin and yang *qi*. Externally, they generate three hundred eighty-four line-spirits; internally, they generate three hundred eighty-four masters of the body. Essence, light, and spirit mutually generate one another; externally, they complete the myriad phenomena of the cosmos—twelve thousand spirits of form and shadow, twelve thousand spirits of ingress and egress, twelve thousand spirits of true *qi*; internally, they complete thirty-six thousand spirits. This is the natural Dao of heaven and earth’s creation.

If the body’s spirits and *qi* remain unerring and unviolated, one grasps the creation and transformation of heaven and earth without deviation, harmonizing internally and externally. If one has violated or depleted them, or is aged and infirm, this practice cannot be undertaken, for in youth, indulgence in excess and desire has withered the primordial spirit, weakened the *qi*, and depleted essence, preventing internal and external *qi* from harmonizing.

For those who attain this profound mechanism, let them focus their minds in stillness, wholly concentrate their spirits, and practice in accordance with the proper timing. Though they may not attain immortality, they can prolong their lives beyond the common span. Once this span is fulfilled and the *qi* can no longer advance, they will naturally expire—becoming earthbound immortals who shed their mortal forms. This is because, at the time of cultivation, there was no primordial *qi*; the method of nurturing life and preserving destiny lies only in gathering essence and perfecting the spirit.

Consider how, when a person initially receives the two *qi* to form a body, the *qi* within the body has its own limits. Once these limits are reached, the *qi* can no longer advance, leading to death. Moreover, the body is the dwelling of *qi*, and *qi* is the master of the body. When the master departs, the dwelling becomes empty; when the dwelling is empty, the body decays. With no place for the master to reside, in all cultivation, one must first cultivate the body and replenish the *qi*. Only when the body and *qi* are fully restored can one nurture destiny—nothing will be unattainable. If one does not first cultivate the body and replenish the *qi*, but only grasps the mechanism of nurturing destiny, gathering the present spirit and *qi* within the body, yet fails to advance, the *qi* will be exhausted, and death will follow. However, if only the nature and consciousness do not scatter, one may shed the mortal form and become an earthbound immortal. If there are those who awaken in old age, they must first cultivate the body and replenish the *qi*, then nurture destiny—naturally attaining transcendence.

**Chapter on Using the Qi of Youth to Supplement the Old**
Old yin seizes young yang, and the yin life naturally flourishes;
Old intestines seize young yin, and the yang lifespan remains unharmed by death.
Those who comprehend this method can rescue the old to become young, reversing aging to return to youth. Once the old attain youth, what other path is there? Simply cultivate according to the root—naturally reversing old age to return to youth. The root is true *qi*; if true *qi* is preserved, it transforms into immortality. If true *qi* is diminished but restored, it becomes the foundation of humanity. Only one *qi* serves as the seed, responding to the creation and transformation of yin and yang, again becoming the root—thus the seed is inexhaustible.

If one’s original true *qi* remains unviolated, grasping the creation and transformation of heaven and earth and practicing accordingly, one can become an immortal. If it has been damaged, relying on the present spirit and *qi* to practice can extend life beyond the common span, becoming an earthbound immortal. If one can apply true *qi* to the body, following the waxing moon’s conjunction to act, receiving the fullness of the transformative *qi* of creation, one will naturally attain spiritual communion.

For those whose true *qi* is severely depleted, take sixteen ounces of black lead of utmost sincerity. Once the lead is obtained, use a bell as a furnace. The lead bell is the white metal of the West’s proper *qi*. For the finest furnaces, use five pounds; for lesser ones, forty-five pounds; for medium ones, ninety pounds; and for the top, five pounds. Use it once daily, corresponding to one cycle every five days. For a forty-five-pound furnace, use it once every forty-five days, corresponding to one seasonal node.

If using ninety pounds, apply it once every ninety days, corresponding to a ninety-day seasonal node. For instance, using it every five days nurtures the *qi* of five days as medicine; using it again after forty-five days gathers the *qi* of forty-five days as medicine; and using it once every ninety days collects the *qi* of ninety days in its entirety as medicine. Each application should begin on the Winter Solstice, when the first *yang* arises. Initially, the furnace must be replaced daily, and it must be of fine quality—free from the nine inauspicious days and ten evil omens, with a moist body and gentle nature—before it can serve as a furnace.

The furnace has eight gates and nine apertures, through which *qi* flows freely up and down. There are three essential pathways: the *qi* of these three pathways emerges from the upper, middle, and lower gates. If the *qi* within the three gates remains unobstructed, it will naturally overflow in five days; in forty-five days, it will overflow abundantly; and in ninety days, the *qi* will reach its peak—this is the natural course.

The upper and middle gates are for nourishment, while the lower gate governs the circulation of *qi* and its application, capturing the *qi* of the crucible and furnace to refine the body. Thus, one must select a body free of illness, abundant in *qi*, moist in constitution, gentle in nature, and harmonious in *qi* to be suitable. Those of harmonious and joyful temperament are the finest. After three years of cultivation, one transcends the mortal realm to become an earthbound immortal.

Moreover, though one may have previously suffered depletion, one must not deplete it entirely—once depleted to the utmost, the person will surely die. Since the person has not yet died, it is because the present *shen* and *qi* still govern. By cultivating and fortifying these present *shen* and *qi*, awaiting the fulfillment of one’s natural lifespan, one may shed the mortal husk to become an earthbound immortal. If one can further supplement and refine them, one will surely attain the rank of divine immortal. Herein lies the principle of tiger-lead and dragon-mercury!

**The True Five Phases Determine the Qi of Destiny**

For one to establish destiny, one must recognize the Five Phases, resolve the golden lock, and nurture the mysterious pearl. Store the *shen* within the primordial palace and subdue the *qi* within the kidneys, returning the essence to ascend and pay homage to the Great Harmony—this is the gateway to sagehood.

The Five Phases are the *true* Five Phases, not the east, west, south, north, and center, nor the wood, fire, earth, metal, and water of ordinary reckoning. These Five Phases are but symbolic correspondences, possessing names yet no form. The true images of the Five Phases have names and forms, yet they are not the five viscera of the human body. The five viscera of the human body are also constituted by the true Five Phases. Only earth has no fixed form; all generation and transformation arise from earth. Externally, it gives birth to heaven and earth; internally, it completes the human body.

True metal is the mother of the human; true wood is the father; true water is the *qi* of metal; true fire is the essence of wood; true earth is the primordial palace of the mother. The four images generate the mysterious, and when gathered into the primordial palace, earth governs them, bringing forth the transformation that becomes the human. The four images of the human body gather *qi*, and the Five Phases enact transformation—nothing fails to take form.

If one seeks to cultivate the Dao, one need only follow the root of transformation, and the divine immortal will naturally emerge. Thus, one must recognize the Five Phases and resolve the golden lock. The golden lock refers to obtaining true lead to subdue true mercury, uniting them as a treasure. When lead binds and subdues mercury, it is called the mysterious pearl. The union of the two *qi* of the golden lock generates transformation into the pearl; storing the *shen* within the primordial palace means that the true *qi* of the four images gives birth to the myriad spirits, converging in the primordial palace.

To "store and subdue the *qi* within the kidneys" means that the mysterious pearl, possessing the twenty-four *qi*, further generates three hundred and eighty-four *qi*. Directing this *qi* to be subdued within the kidneys is called "subduing the *qi*." "Returning the essence to ascend and pay homage" means that the *shen* and *qi* within the body follow the circulation of *ying* and *wei*, moving and transforming to become the path of returning essence—also called golden essence.

**The Two Qi Unite and the Method of Binding Qi**

The two *qi* are tiger-lead and dragon-mercury. Tiger-lead, when gathered, becomes a treasure in the primordial palace; when dispersed, it circulates as *qi* throughout the body. When *qi* arrives, it gathers; when gathered, it unites; when dispersed, it moves—thus, there must be no error. Binding *qi* occurs when the two *qi* meet and unite. For instance, on the first day after the new moon at the *gui* hour, the *qi* of the Great Yin arrives. At the proper time, one draws the lead; when true *qi* descends, lead also descends. Taking it into the primordial palace of the Azure Dragon, how could one be content with a single *qi*? Only with both *qi* can one be complete.

Moreover, tiger-lead is the true *qi* of white metal. Take between thirteen and fourteen ounces of white metal, bathe it in fragrant water within a quiet chamber, and use medicine to subdue its original nature. Await the proper time to draw it as usual, preventing contamination by external *qi*. If external *qi* intrudes, it will not enter the primordial palace but will be expelled with the dregs. If true lead is obtained at the proper time, immediately unite the two *qi* to bind them. If obtained at the *gui* hour, unite them at the *chou* hour. Once obtained, allow metal and wood to meet and overcome each other. When metal is overcome, its nature is stirred; once stirred, true *qi* descends. When true *qi* descends, desire arises and threatens to leak. By restraining it from leaking, the two *qi* naturally unite. Subsequent days and hours follow this pattern.

Furthermore, binding *qi* means that true lead binds true mercury, signifying that the four images and Five Phases are complete—this is the root of human existence. The establishment of the human body requires thirty days for *qi* to be complete and three hundred days for transformation to achieve form. This place of establishment is the original dwelling of the White Tiger in the primordial palace, the abode of *kun*. *Kun* is true earth; the true *qi* of the four images take earth as their master, and thus they cannot be destroyed. Even so, they may still suffer varying degrees of harm—how much more so when one reverses the process to draw the two *qi* into the primordial palace of the Azure Dragon? This dwelling place is without peer in its *qi*, and thus there is a thirty-day method of nurturing and a three-hundred-day mechanism of transformation. If one grasps this mechanism and attains the transformation of heaven and earth, how could one not become a divine immortal?

The thirty-day nurturing involves, after the two *qi* unite and bind, refraining from further activity or distracting thoughts. Assign two fellow cultivators to observe the timing, harmonizing inner and outer to ensure the four images’ *qi* is sufficient. When it enters the central palace and fulfills the proper count of yin and yang, after thirty days, it will naturally congeal. If the circulation of *qi* is incomplete or the count insufficient, the *qi* will not be complete. Thus, one must single-mindedly nurture it for thirty days. Thereafter, the three hundred days will also fulfill the transformation of heaven and earth, aligning inner and outer movements without obstruction.

**The Five Phases Manifest Their True Colors and Correspond Within and Without**

When circulating the *qi* of the five viscera, observe the seasons, months, and days to align inner and outer correspondences in practice. For instance, the liver viscus belongs to wood and flourishes in spring. Within the three months of spring, select an *jia* or *yi* day and hour. Sit upright, free from thoughts and distractions, tightly seal the earthly gate, and fully open the heavenly gate. Inhale and exhale softly, preventing the *qi* from rushing or scattering. With single-minded focus, cause the *ying* and *wei* to circulate the *qi* of the liver viscus. It ascends from the double passes of the spine to reach the brain, then descends from the crown of the head into the mouth. After rinsing and swallowing, it enters the twelve-storied tower, first transmitting to the lungs, then to the kidneys, kidneys to the liver, liver to the heart, heart to the spleen, and spleen into the primordial palace, where the spirit-turtle receives it.

When the spirit-turtle completes its circulatory cycle of the celestial revolution, the *qi* rushes upward of its own accord and flows into the two apertures beneath the tongue, whereupon a blue-green hue emerges—this signifies the smooth flow of the liver viscus’s true *qi*. The remaining four viscera follow this same pattern.

For instance, when first circulating the liver viscus’s *qi*, begin during the *jia* or *yi* days and hours of the three spring months. All the above pertains to the liver’s flourishing phase, ensuring no other visceral *qi* intermingles, allowing only its own *qi* and *ying-wei* to traverse the body’s pathways. Once the five viscera complete their celestial revolution, the generated *qi* nourishes the body. Its most refined essence is stored within the primordial palace, where the five phases’ generative and destructive cycles remain in their proper positions without further egress.

When spring’s three months return, again select a *jia* or *yi* day and hour to reinitiate the practice within the primordial palace. The accumulated true *qi* of the liver viscus emerges once more, circulating through the five viscera and the *ying-wei* throughout the body. Thus, the liver’s original *qi* manifests purely, without admixture, as a singular blue-green hue. The remaining four viscera follow this same pattern. If each of the five viscera distinctly presents its inherent color, this is the definitive verification.

**The Chapter of the Golden Lock**
The Golden Lock method involves extracting the White Tiger’s primordial channel, known as true lead. The optimal counts are two sevens (fourteen), two eights (sixteen), and three fives (fifteen). The timing must be pure and untainted, lest external *qi* intrude; if contaminated, it will not enter the primordial palace but instead exit with the dregs.

Moreover, *jin* (metal) is the true *qi* of the western direction, and true *qi* is true lead. Lead is the true *qi* dwelling within the White Tiger’s abode. The term *lock* signifies closure—sealing the Azure Dragon’s true *qi* to prevent its dissipation and leakage. The Azure Dragon’s true *qi* is true mercury, and true mercury is the Azure Dragon’s abode of utmost essence.

The Dragon and Tiger’s utmost essences are transformations of the four symbolic true *qi*, thus lacking form or substance. Lead and mercury each possess their own inherent nature; earth governs them, and only through their union does their *qi* assume tangible form. Together, they constitute the two *qi*, and when these two *qi* meet, they naturally coalesce into treasure. Therefore, one employs subtle means to secretly draw the White Tiger’s true lead into the Azure Dragon’s primordial palace.

All lead originally resides within the White Tiger’s primordial palace, yet when returned to the Azure Dragon’s primordial palace, it remains untainted and thus abides there. Once true lead resides within the primordial palace, it restrains mercury. When mercury encounters lead, they naturally cling to one another, no longer dispersing—thus forming the daily Golden Lock.

The principles of lead entering the Dragon and mercury entering the Tiger are thus elucidated!

*Volume Four of the* **True Scripture of the Eight Radiant Scenes of the Primordial** *concludes.*
*Volume Five of the* **True Scripture of the Eight Radiant Scenes of the Primordial** *begins.*

**Chapter on Generating the Mysterious Pearl**

The method of the Mysterious Pearl requires fourteen taels of unrefined white gold, up to one catty. Once obtained, cause Metal and Wood to meet, with the mind undisturbed, free from extraneous intent. Employ the numbers of yin and yang as its guiding principle; when the nine-nines are complete, it is achieved.

If Wood senses decline, use Metal to restrain it, preventing movement. Then close the eyes, arch the spine, contract the abdomen, and gather the qi. Curl the ten fingers like hooks, drawing up the primordial qi without the slightest wavering. After a long while in concentrated stillness, wait until settled, then repeat the process. Again, follow the previous method to restrain the Azure Dragon’s true qi from leaking, returning it to the primordial palace. Proceed thus, performing sixteen cycles at the proper times, and it will coalesce into the Mysterious Pearl.

The Mysterious Pearl is formed by the convergence of the true qi of the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols arise from Metal and Wood! Wood is the Azure Dragon, the Dragon is yang; Metal is the White Tiger, the Tiger is yin. Within yin lies true essence—lead; within yang lies true essence—mercury. Lead restrains mercury, and mercury clings to lead. When lead and mercury unite, they naturally resonate, and the Mysterious Pearl is effortlessly achieved.

Thus, first employ subtle means to draw true lead back to reside in the Azure Dragon’s primordial palace, whereupon mercury will naturally remain as well. Lead and mercury are the abodes of the Dragon and Tiger’s purest essences. When the qi of Dragon and Tiger obtain lead and mercury, they naturally converge, forming a resonant bond called the Mysterious Pearl.

How is this known? Initially, true lead is congealed within the Azure Dragon’s primordial palace. Later, Metal and Wood are again made to meet. Wood, subdued by Metal, stirs in its nature—once stirred, its qi descends, and with descent comes the urge to leak. Restrain it to prevent leakage, yet it cannot return to its origin, nor can it ascend. Thus, it reverts to its root-source, re-entering the palace to unite with mercury, coalescing into the Mysterious Pearl. This is accomplished below the navel, where intense heat arises, like a cauldron ablaze.

**Chapter on the Mysterious Pearl Coalescing into the Golden Elixir**

Again, cause Metal and Wood to meet, proceeding with meticulous care. When the Metal Tiger’s nature is stirred to its utmost, and the intent cannot be restrained—when it rushes urgently toward Wood—then release the Mysterious Pearl to enter the Palace of Mutual Resonance.

This palace belongs to Earth, encompassing the Five Phases. When thirty days’ qi is complete, the form and image are fully realized, seizing the three hundred days of Heaven and Earth’s transformation. With upper and lower harmonized, perfection is attained—this is called the Golden Elixir.

After ten months of fulfillment, it descends from beneath the left breast, the size of a cherry, its body like fresh blood, radiant with crimson-purple light that dazzles the eye—this is the Golden Elixir. When the White Tiger receives the Mysterious Pearl at the Cavity of Mutual Resonance, this qi differs from ordinary times. Greatly avoid sorrow and joy, cold and heat, anger and hunger, strife and satiety. If any of these are violated, the elixir will surely be ruined.

Thus, one must daily maintain tranquility, preventing disturbance, and focus solely on the elixir’s qi reaching completion. When it is about to descend, use a vessel of contention to receive it, bathe it in fragrant water, and once its qi is fully stabilized and cooled, place it upon the altar in the heart. Carry the elixir upward from the Earth Gate, ascending to the Three Markets of the Altar. Stand facing north, raise your gaze, and give thanks to the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Dao Lord, and the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Then swallow it, forever anchoring it within the primordial palace.

Thus it is said: Store the spirit and retain the qi, returning essence upward to the brain, allowing upper and lower qi to communicate. The elixir’s qi circulates, naturally effecting transformation—silently transmuting sinews, bones, skin, and hair—entering the sagely Dao.

For the Golden Elixir can transform the dharma-realm’s heaven and earth, transcending the mundane to attain sagehood, enabling the communication of upper and lower qi and the opening of all joints. As the Golden Elixir’s qi circulates, it silently transmutes the mortal body into an immortal form. Those who ingest it will, within three years, completely transform their mortal frame, becoming a Perfected One. They will ascend freely, paying homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy—this is no falsehood!

Thus, thirty-six thousand spirits of luminous essence, twelve thousand spirits of form and shadow, twelve thousand spirits of true qi, and twelve thousand spirits of ingress and egress attend and guard, moving freely in all directions. This arises from the yin and yang qi. The two qi govern the Four Symbols, the Four Symbols establish the Five Phases, the Five Phases generate the myriad things, and the myriad things are the myriad spirits.

**Chapter on the Establishment of the Great Dao through Golden Liquor and White Paste**

Golden Liquor and White Paste are transformations of the true qi of the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols arise from the union of Dragon and Tiger, the congealing of lead and mercury, which are then matched within the Central Palace, encompassing the Five Phases.

The Dragon and Tiger are true yin and true yang. Within yang are the three yin: spirit, qi, and essence; within yin are the three yang: spirit, qi, and essence—these are Kan, Gen, Zhen, Xun, Li, and Dui. Three within yin and three within yang make six, paired with Dragon and Tiger to form eight. Each eight generates another eight, yielding sixty-four hexagrams, each with six lines, totaling three hundred eighty-four lines. Within the body, three hundred eighty-four spirits arise. Each yin spirit and yang spirit unite, generating another three hundred eighty-four spirits, thus producing thirty-six thousand spirits throughout the body. This arises from yin and yang generating the Four Symbols, the Four Symbols generating the Five Phases, and the Five Phases generating the myriad things.

When the human body first receives the two qi in the mother’s womb, after thirty days the qi is complete. Beneath the breasts, a membrane forms, from which flows the Golden Liquor—this is the Golden Liquor and White Paste. Once this paste is obtained and irrigates the body, it naturally seizes the transformations of Heaven and Earth, thereby forming the human body.

If one seeks to cultivate the body, how can one depart from the Golden Liquor and White Paste? When a person first receives the two qi in the mother’s primordial palace, they descend beneath the breasts to generate the Golden Liquor and White Paste. Now, if one returns to receive the two qi within one’s own primordial palace, from whence shall the Golden Liquor and White Paste emerge?

Yet the Golden Liquor and White Paste are the transformations of the true qi of yin-yang and the Five Phases. Simply gather the qi of yin-yang and the Five Phases, and the White Paste will naturally arise. When the qi of yin-yang gathers and obtains the true qi of the Five Phases, it emerges from the Cinnabar Field, ascending from the Kan Palace to the two orifices beneath the tongue, whereupon the Golden Liquor and White Paste issue forth. Refining the Three Origins of yin-yang and the Five Phases until their measures are complete, they congeal into the White Paste. This paste then follows the circulation of the constructive and protective qi, coursing through the channels and network vessels to irrigate the entire body, reaching the Primordial Palace where the gathered essence is spirit and qi. This spirit and qi, riding upon the primordial qi of the White Paste, circulate and penetrate the numinous, subtly seizing the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Exchanging sinews, bones, skin, and hair, after three years the mortal body is entirely transformed, and a divine immortal surely emerges—this is no falsehood.

Moreover, the great elixir of Golden Cinnabar and all medicinal qi do not depart from the transformations of the Golden Liquor and White Paste. Yet later learners, unaware of the root of Heaven and Earth, attempt to refine the Golden Cinnabar using only the present spirit, qi, and essence. If they follow the method and apply it diligently, knowing the technique and maintaining their practice without lapse, they may still transcend ordinary lifespan, reversing aging and restoring youth. How much more so if they cultivate from the root—then attaining immortality would be as clear as viewing one’s palm!

**Chapter on the Method of Departure and Abiding During the Conjunction of Sun and Moon**

Those who cultivate and refine must observe the movements of the sun and moon—what does this mean? Heaven and Earth employ the sun and moon as their function, while humans employ the constructive and protective qi as theirs. If learners align their internal sun and moon with the external sun and moon, moving in perfect accord, their lifespan will equal that of Heaven and Earth.

Now, Heaven and Earth exchange the qi of the twelve pitch-pipes and Five Phases, while the sun and moon conjoin to produce and nurture the myriad things. If the sun and moon conjoin but their qi do not, it harms the fields of the body. If the sun and moon move but their qi do not, one gradually declines into aging and illness. Simply emulate the movements of the sun and moon with the constructive and protective qi, governing them within the body—then there is no way for aging to take hold, and one naturally attains longevity and eternal life.

That Heaven endures and Earth abides is due to the governance of the Three Wonders: the sun, moon, and stars. The sun, moon, and stars are the purest essences of Heaven and Earth, called the Three Wonders. If there were no sun by day or moon by night, where would the stars remain in Heaven and Earth? The Three Wonders of humans are spirit, qi, and essence. If one’s spirit departs, essence is exhausted, and qi is cut off, where would the person remain?

Spirit is the qi of the constructive and protective forces: the constructive is the sun, the protective is the moon. When the external sun and moon meet, internally cause the qi to unite; when the external sun and moon move, internally cause the qi to flow. Thus, one’s lifespan naturally equals that of Heaven and Earth, and aging no longer occurs. If one further refines the elixir, there is nothing that does not reach the state of Heaven and Earth.

Moreover, the movements of the sun and moon follow a thirty-day cycle, each with its own method. The sun has twelve hours in a day, but only nine are responsive—three are unresponsive. Over thirty days, this amounts to 360 hours, of which 270 are responsive and ninety are not. The moon, in thirty days, shines for only twenty-four; the six days before and after remain unseen. This is because the moon is born in *shen* and its qi moves in reverse, reaching the *xu*, *hai*, and *zi* palaces—pure yin’s abode and the moon’s secret chamber. Within thirty days, the first three and last three days find the moon returning to its original palace, not leaving its own abode—the *xu*, *hai*, and *zi* palaces. Arriving at its own palace, it abides, hence it does not shine.

The sun is born in *yin* and moves forward to the *xu*, *hai*, and *zi* palaces, where it encounters the moon’s position. There, the two qi meet and conjoin, so it does not respond. From the twenty-seventh to the third day of the next cycle—six days in total—is the time of the sun and moon’s pregnancy. Thus, the moon does not shine, and the sun does not respond. Arriving at its own palace, it abides, hence it does not shine.

If learners have obtained sufficient qi, they should align the internal with the external. When the sun and moon conjoin, the constructive and protective qi should also conjoin; when the sun and moon move, the constructive and protective qi should also flow—this is the union of internal and external. The first three and last three days, the moon parts from the sun at *chen* hour, returning to its original palace. From the fourth to the eighth day and the twenty-third to the twenty-seventh day, the sun parts from the moon at *chou* hour. The moon first emerges above *geng* on the third day and gradually sets after the twenty-seventh. From the eighth to the twenty-third day, the sun parts from the moon at *gui* hour, and the moon’s qi is full, hence it shines brightly in the world. The qi and seasons of the sun and moon move in unison with those of Heaven and Earth, not differing by even a fraction—thus Heaven and Earth endure. If learners follow this method, causing the constructive and protective qi to unite with the sun and moon and circulate within the body, their qi and seasons will not err, and their lifespan will equal that of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon. These are the methods governing the sun, moon, constructive, and protective qi within the thirty-day cycle.

**Chapter on the Conjunction of Sun, Moon, and Qi of the Three Origins for Establishing Life**

Each time this practice is performed, proceed as follows:
- From the first to the third day after the new moon, begin at *gui* hour and cease at *xu* hour;
- From the fourth to the eighth day, begin at *chou* hour and cease at *xu* hour;
- From the ninth to the twenty-third day, begin at *gen* hour and cease at *xu* hour;
- From the twenty-fourth to the twenty-seventh day, begin at *chou* hour and cease at *xu* hour;
- From the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day, begin at *gui* hour and cease at *xu* hour.

This is because the moon and sun conjoin in the *xu*, *hai*, and *zi* hours among the twelve hours of the day, and the constructive and protective qi of humans do likewise. Therefore, during these three hours, one must cease practice to allow the constructive and protective qi to conjoin. After completing the above circulating practice, one must wait until the qi and seasons are sufficient before proceeding again.

Begin from the lung viscus, ensuring that each viscus’s qi passes through the lung and enters the Central Palace. After thirty-five breaths, complete seven cycles, then transmit to the kidney. The kidney’s qi enters the Central Palace, and after thirty-five breaths, transmit to the liver. The liver’s qi enters the Central Palace, and after twenty-five breaths, transmit to the heart. The heart’s qi enters the Central Palace, and after fifteen breaths, transmit to the spleen viscus. This totals one hundred and twenty breaths, called "one celestial revolution."

Then hold the breath until the utmost limit of endurance is reached, swallowing and directing it to the Primordial Palace. For the first day, conduct the Fire practice; for the second, circulate the qi; and for the third, assist the constructive and protective qi. After completing sixteen celestial revolutions, this constitutes one cycle of practice. Within a day of twelve hours, practice for nine hours and rest for three. After sixteen revolutions, the yin and yang qi are fully prepared. Within thirty days, the qi condenses and solidifies; by three hundred days, the transformation is naturally complete. Simply follow this practice, and all will be precisely aligned.

The true qi of Greater Yin is the White Tiger’s true lead, the mother of all things. When the true qi of Greater Yang descends, it descends; when the true qi of Greater Yin lies concealed, it lies concealed. When descending, it enters the profound obscurity where the true qi of Greater Yin resides. The descent of Greater Yin qi occurs at specific times and days; if one practices when the day and hour do not align, not one in ten thousand will attain the Dao. Since the true qi of Greater Yin descends and conceals of its own accord, there is no need for forced effort—simply follow its descent, and all great matters of timing will be accomplished.

From the twenty-eighth day before the new moon to the third day after, these six days are the days of Greater Yin’s conjunction. Thus, the true qi of Greater Yang descends, and for these six days, practice must be conducted according to the designated hours. On the day after the new moon and the thirtieth day, the true qi arrives at the *gui* hour, gathers at the *chou* hour, and disperses at the *gen* hour. On the second day and the twenty-ninth day, the true qi arrives at the *zi* hour, gathers at the *gui* hour, and disperses at the *chou* hour. On the third day and the twenty-eighth day, it arrives at the *ren* hour, gathers at the *zi* hour, and disperses at the *gui* hour.

When gathering true lead, one must await the arrival of the qi to take it; when the qi gathers, unite with it; when it disperses, circulate it. If even a hair’s breadth is misaligned, the practice will be of no benefit. Just as in refining the elixir or perceiving the present spirit and qi, one must take the qi when it arrives, unite with it when it gathers, and circulate it when it disperses. To fail to take it when it arrives is to stagnate the qi; to fail to unite when it gathers is to exhaust the qi; to fail to circulate when it disperses is to waste the qi. These are the subtle signs of decay in the body. Without perceiving this mechanism, even with ten thousand kinds of practice, one will only join the ranks of those who court death.

**Establishing the Altar and Configuring the Qi Manifestation**

To establish the altar is to align with the qi cycles of Heaven and Earth. To await the initial movement of Heaven and Earth is to observe the sun, moon, and five planets. The sun and moon are Greater Yin and Greater Yang; the five planets are the Five Phases. When the sun, moon, and five planets revolve, the qi cycles of Heaven and Earth do not err, and the four seasons naturally follow their proper order.

The pivot of the human body is the constructive, protective, and five viscera qi. If the constructive, protective, and five viscera qi are harmonized, the four seasons will naturally respond. The sun, moon, and five planets divide and circulate the seven qi, and the constructive, protective, and five viscera qi likewise circulate the seven qi, completing a cycle of three hundred and sixty days, which corresponds to one celestial revolution.

Five days constitute one *hou* (climatic phase), forty-five days one *jie* (seasonal node), and ninety days one *qi* (seasonal qi). The five-day *hou* is established because the sixty *jiazi* spirits govern affairs, and each day is divided into twelve *chen* (double-hours), thus twelve hours form one day. The qi of the six *jia* spirits completes a full cycle, then returns to the five *jiazi* spirits, hence "five days make one *hou*." In three hundred and sixty days, there are seventy-two *hou*. If one’s qi cycles do not err, the same applies.

Forty-five days make one *jie* because a day has twelve hours—six yin and six yang—paired with day and night to form a node, corresponding to the eight trigrams. These eight trigrams are the spirits governing a single day. Humans likewise possess twelve primordial spirits, named the six yin and six yang spirits, which pair with the constructive and protective qi to form the eight trigrams, also governing a single day. Forty-five days comprise three hundred and sixty hours, hence "one *jie*." In three hundred and sixty days, there are eight *jie*.

Ninety days make one *qi* because forty-five days yield the qi of three hundred and sixty spirits, and ninety days yield seven hundred and twenty, hence "one *qi*." In three hundred and sixty days, there are four *qi*. Humans are the same. If one can circulate the constructive, protective, and five viscera qi throughout the body without obstruction, aligning the body’s movement with that of Heaven and Earth, then naturally five days make one *hou*, forty-five days one *jie*, and ninety days one *qi*, perfectly matching the celestial cycles without the slightest deviation.

If one does not understand the movement of Heaven and Earth’s qi cycles and forcibly circulates the true qi within the body’s field, one risks damaging the primordial spirit, leaving the spirit and qi deficient and unable to harmonize with external qi. If one has not damaged the primordial spirit, the spirit and qi remain whole; simply follow this mechanism, aligning with the conjunction of the sun and moon’s qi cycles and precisely adhering to the time, and all will be accomplished. If one has damaged the primordial spirit, one must grasp the root and origin to repair it, replenishing the qi, restoring the spirit, and filling the essence. Then, practicing according to the method, all will be accomplished.

**Determining the Twelve Hours and Dividing the Clepsydra’s Four Symbolic Qi Gathering and Dispersal**

The movement of Heaven and Earth is measured by the clepsydra. To initiate practice and establish positions, the framework of the clepsydra is divided: one day is fixed at one hundred *ke*. Of these hundred *ke*, the four positions of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are each allotted nine *ke*, while the eight positions of *yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* are each allotted eight *ke*. Four times nine is thirty-six, and eight times eight is sixty-four, totaling one hundred *ke*, which defines the qi cycles of day and night.

* Zi* marks the beginning of yang, the inception of yang qi’s generation. After *wu*, it is the beginning of yin, the initial growth of yin qi. *Mao* is the peak of yang’s flourishing. *Zi* corresponds to the north, the *ren* and *gui* waters, the *Kan* trigram, the Dark Warrior, and the spirit of water.

Wu corresponds to the south, aligning with the *bing* and *ding* fires, governed by the *Li* trigram. Its symbol is the Vermilion Bird, the spirit of fire. Mao corresponds to the east, aligning with the *jia* and *yi* woods, governed by the *Zhen* trigram. Its symbol is the Azure Dragon, the spirit of wood. You corresponds to the west, aligning with the *geng* and *xin* metals, governed by the *Dui* trigram. Its symbol is the White Tiger, the spirit of metal. These Four Symbols generate and complete the world, establishing heaven and earth as their foundation. They are the lords of heaven and earth, known as the Four Symbols. Thus, each occupies nine *ke* in its respective position.

Yin, shen, si, hai, chen, xu, chou, and wei each govern eight *ke*. These eight are called the Eight Trigrams, serving as auxiliaries to the Four Symbols, following their qi in waxing and waning.

In conducting the three primordial qi, one must rely on the *ke* as the standard. If even a single *yu ke* is misaligned, the true qi cannot coalesce. For instance, the thirty days following the new moon mark the convergence of heaven and earth’s qi, where the revolutions of the sun and moon generate all things. When the qi of heaven and earth harmonize, each being follows its nature, conforming to the transformations of yin and yang.

Consider the human body: initially, it receives the true qi of the Four Symbols, which condense and fill it, seizing the creative power of heaven and earth to become human. If it did not subtly align with the mechanisms of yin-yang interaction, how could the Four Symbols condense and gather? Only when internal and external mechanisms harmonize does one naturally emerge from nothingness, and through creation, become human. Thus, the human body is rare and precious.

Now, with this corporeal form, one seizes the creative transformations of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, their qi and temperament, their ebb and flow, their gathering and dispersion—all aligned with the *ke* of the clepsydra. This principle of cultivation and refinement is most straightforward.

For example, on the first and thirtieth days after the new moon, during the *gui* hour, the true qi of Greater Yin descends. One must then engage the internal qi with the external qi in contest. Without the precise method of the clepsydra, how could the *gui* hour be accurately determined? Since *gui* lies between *zi* and *chou*, one must rely on the heart-mind as the standard, yet this inevitably introduces error.

*Zi* governs nine *ke* of *chou*, but at four and a half *ke* after *zi*, it becomes the *gui* hour, when the true qi of Greater Yin descends. After receiving the descending qi, one takes the four *ke* following *gui*, which belong to *chou*, where the true qi gathers. Then, the next four *ke* belong to *gen*, where the qi disperses. After dispersion, the cycle continues, and the subsequent hundred *ke* follow this pattern. Thus, the creative transformations of heaven and earth rely on the clepsydra as their standard.

**Chapter on Seizing the Thirty Days of Accumulated Intercalary Merit**
Within three years, there are thirty intercalary days. Seizing these as the "Thirty Days of Great Merit" is a method extending beyond the three-year period. Those who achieve this are not far from attaining immortality. This is a swift and efficacious shortcut.

The "Thirty Days of Great Merit" refers to the intercalary days accumulated within three years. As heaven and earth’s creative transformations reach fulfillment, surplus qi accumulates within. Over three years, thirty days of surplus intercalary qi may be amassed, termed "residual intercalary qi." By doubling the method of cultivation, one can condense thirty days of heaven and earth’s qi into three hundred days of creation, where all phenomena are complete.

Consider the human embryo: it also receives qi in the mother’s womb for thirty days, during which its form and body are fully prepared. After three hundred days of creation, its form is perfected, and it descends into the world as a human. Furthermore, three years of nursing are required for the body to fully develop.

If one understands how to refine this thirty days of residual qi according to the method, the true nature will condense in thirty days, instantly acquiring spiritual penetration. Thus, it is called "Great Merit." Upon completion of this merit, one can sit or stand at will, vanish or appear, traverse doors and windows, and arrive wherever desired.

The method states: three practitioners of the same Dao must work together; one cannot be absent. After fifteen days of lesser merit, the true nature begins to separate from the shell. Thus, one person must remain at the practitioner’s side, calling out at every hour, ensuring the clepsydra’s *ke* are precisely followed. If even a single *ke* is missed, the true nature may not return.

Why is this? Once the primordial true nature departs the mortal shell and later awakens, it is akin to the creative process where the two qi converge, and existence emerges from nothingness to form a body, which then descends into the world. To emulate this mystery and refine the body’s method to become an immortal, one must, after descending into the world, guard against being deluded by the *rong* and *wei* qi, lest one forgets the mechanisms of self-cultivation and creation.

Once the true nature departs the mortal shell and later returns, the body risks contamination by impure influences, and the true nature may not return. Thus, someone must call out at every hour. Upon hearing the call, the true nature recognizes the body’s cultivation and returns.

After twenty days, the true nature manifests daily, its original form departing the body, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. By the twenty-sixth day, the bodily form is not yet fully shaped, termed *Taiyi* (Supreme Simplicity). *Yi* means "to unite," signifying the union of being and non-being. By the twenty-seventh day, the primordial qi begins to sprout, termed *Taichu* (Supreme Origin). *Chu* means "to sprout," the first awakening of bodily form. By the twenty-eighth day, the form and qi become distinct, termed *Taishi* (Supreme Beginning). "Distinct" means the true nature’s form is now clearly established. By the twenty-ninth day, the bodily form acquires substance, termed *Taisu* (Supreme Simplicity). The true form is now embodied in substance, appearing pure and white. By the thirtieth day, the true nature’s form and substance are complete, termed *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). The form and substance are fully prepared, and the true nature, freed from substance, moves without obstruction.

Though one may not yet attain immortality at this stage, it is indeed a convenient path to lesser sagehood.

In practicing this method, one must rely on the clepsydra as the standard. The detailed clepsydra method has been outlined earlier. Wherever one cultivates, the space must be open, level, and expansive. A three-tiered altar is erected, with its principles also detailed earlier. The altar’s configuration and the clepsydra’s *ke* chart are provided later.

Beyond the three-tiered altar, the twelve positions are arranged, each aligned with its respective number to form a complete cycle of one hundred *ke*. One person sits at the altar’s center, reporting each *ke* in sequence.

For example, if initiating practice on the *jiazi* day after the spring equinox at midnight (*zi* hour), since *hai* governs eight *ke* and *zi* governs nine *ke*, the first three *ke* overlap with the *rong* and *wei* qi’s interaction, and the exact *zi* hour is missed. Thus, one must begin at three and a half *ke* after *hai*, which belongs to *zi*. Four and a half *ke* after *zi* belongs to *chou*, and four *ke* after *chou* belongs to *yin*.

One must call out at feeding times, using white paste as the essential ingredient. This white paste is made from the first milk of a woman who has given birth to her first child. For each *sheng* of breast milk, take two *jin* of white sandalwood honey, half a *liang* of musk, one *liang* of cinnabar, half a *liang* of frankincense, and half a *liang* of borneol. Grind all the above finely into powder and place it in a porcelain jar. Then, take well-washed white rice, mix it evenly with flour, and add it to the medicinal jar. Steam until fully cooked.

Beginning on the day practice commences, consume one spoonful at each of the twelve hours daily. After five days, increase the dose by half a spoonful each day. After ten days, increase by two spoonfuls. After fifteen days, increase to two and a half spoonfuls. After twenty days, increase to three spoonfuls, and thereafter make no further additions.

After twenty-six days, the true nature will depart from the body, revealing its original form, and one will be able to engage in discourse. At this point, the great achievement will manifest in full. **End of Scroll Five of the *Hunyuan Bajing Zhenjing*.**
