**Section One**

**Chapter One: The Transformation of the Dao**

At that time, in the first year of the Primordial Ultimate Era, the year *guichou* (Water-Ox), on the seventh day of the tenth month, the Supreme Lord ascended the Seven Treasures Hall within the Great Clarity Palace to discourse upon the Perfect and Wondrous Dao.

Then the Supreme Lord addressed the Left Mysterious Perfected One, saying:
In the Great Beginning, there was primordial chaos, and heaven and earth first divided. Yin and yang brought forth transformation, and the myriad beings were endowed with spirit.

The *Great Beginning* is the origin of chaos; *chaos* is that which preceded the division of heaven and earth. Taking the Great Beginning as its source, heaven and earth first separated, yin and yang paired and united, the Five Phases were established, and the transformations of the four seasons were apportioned to give rise to the myriad beings. By force of naming, this is called the *Dao*.

The Dao is the mother of heaven and earth, yin and yang, the ancestor of the Five Phases and the myriad beings. The Dao’s original form is formless, and thus it is forcibly named the *Dao*.

Its form is in the indistinct and imperceptible.
The *indistinct and imperceptible* signify clarity and profundity. The Great Dao, when beheld, has no image; when listened to, no sound; when sought afar, no rule; when approached, no reliance. Thus, its image is in the indistinct, and its form is in emptiness and nothingness.

Follow it, and principle is found; with diligent intent, all becomes clear.
The Great Dao is formless, its principles profound and distant. Without diligent intent, its wondrous principles are difficult to comprehend. Hold fast to the end as to the beginning, and meritorious deeds will be accomplished.

Those who cultivate the Dao must practice their meritorious deeds, preserving the end as the beginning. Whether great or small, none will fail to achieve perfection.

Observe fasting and uphold the precepts; simplicity is the gateway.
People take fasting as precepts and precepts as conduct. With fasting and precepts as conduct, simplicity becomes the root.

Body and mind are pure and still, without love or aversion.
The spirit delights in stillness, yet the distinctions of body and mind disturb it. The Supreme Lord, with a mind devoid of mind and a body devoid of body, empties the heart to realize true nature. Without body, there is yet spirit; when spirit and nature unite, this is the essence of sagely Dao.

Taking emptiness and nothingness as its substance, how could there be love or aversion?

The six desires do no harm,
The six desires are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mind, and intent. The tongue craves flavors, the eyes behold forms, the ears listen to sounds, the nose smells fragrances, and the mind and intent cling to affairs. Desires follow emotions in pursuit of things, disturbing body and mind—these are the thieves of the six senses.

And the myriad spirits submit.
Within the human body dwell thirty-six thousand spirits, all fond of life and averse to death. If one preserves the principles of the Mysterious Origin and comprehends the Dao of non-action, keeping the body free from defilement, how could the myriad spirits not submit?

Cultivate the mind and refine nature—this is my original body.
To *cultivate the mind* is to have a mind devoid of mind; to *refine nature* is to have a nature devoid of nature. The Supreme Lord is the spirit of purity, stillness, emptiness, and nothingness, the honored one of the Mysterious Origin’s perfect virtue.

If one sheds emotional defilements, sets aside right and wrong, and preserves the principles of the Great Dao, how could they not become one with the original body?

My body is not the Dao; through the Dao, it becomes true.
The *body is not the Dao* because the Dao is emptiness. Without body, there is yet form; the Dao resides within the human body like fire within stone—without striking, it does not manifest. Thus, the body is not the Dao.

Strike it, and form appears—thus, through the Dao, it becomes true.

Darkly harmonizing with heaven and earth, in the profound and obscure,
The *profound and obscure* are the images of clarity, emptiness, and stillness. Heaven and earth and the myriad beings arise through the Dao. The Dao has no form or body, thus it darkly harmonizes within the profound and obscure emptiness.

Yang’s form and substance, day and night are both divided.
Heaven has no form or image; day and night are its foundation. The Dao has no form or image; meritorious deeds, fasting, and precepts are its root.

The four seasons are its signs, revolving through ancient and modern times.
The *four seasons* are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Heaven takes the four seasons as its signs; the Dao responds through spiritual transformation. From the Primordial Beginning to the present, has there ever been a lapse?

Without speaking, it responds with goodness; the myriad beings all submit.
Heaven does not speak, yet through yin and yang and the four seasons, it responds with goodness. The myriad beings receive the seasons and naturally live and die—how could they not submit as guests?

Embody it, and it is called the Dao; rely upon it, and it is called the True.
The mechanisms of heaven and earth, the sentiments of the four seasons—if one embodies and applies them, cultivating within the body, accomplishing the three thousand meritorious deeds, transforming the self into a sage, and ascending as a perfected one, this is the True.

**Chapter Two: The Five Phases**

The Five Phases bring forth transformation; yin and yang are their utmost essence.
The *Five Phases* are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They transform the myriad beings, pairing and uniting yin and yang, becoming the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad beings.

Wood, fire, metal, and water are named the Four Images.
The *Four Images* are named by the Dao: the Infant Boy, the Maiden Girl, Metal Elder, and Yellow Crone.

The Green Dragon extends to the left; the White Tiger is tamed to the right. The Vermilion Bird stands before; the Dark Warrior welcomes behind.
The Green Dragon pertains to wood and governs the liver on the left; the White Tiger pertains to metal and governs the lungs on the right; the Vermilion Bird pertains to fire and governs the heart in front; the Dark Warrior pertains to water and governs the kidneys behind. These are the lords of the Five Phases.

*Bing*, *ding*, *jia*, *yi*, *ren*, *gui*, *geng*, *xin*—
These are the proper names of the four directions.

The east, ninefold blackness, gives rise to the myriad beings;
The *east, ninefold blackness* is the first of the four seasons, called the *wind of harmony and brightness*, which gives rise to the myriad beings.

The south, threefold blackness, is the spirit of growth and nourishment;
The *south, threefold blackness* is called the *scorching wind*, which nourishes the myriad beings.

The west, sevenfold blackness, is the pale and bright harvest;
The *west, sevenfold blackness* is called the *metal wind*, which brings the decline and withering of the myriad beings.

The north, fivefold blackness, is the Dark Heaven’s return to the root.
The *north, fivefold blackness* is called the *cold wind*, where the myriad beings rest and each returns to its root.

Here is the translation:

---

This is the record of the four *qi*. Each flourishes in its eight or nine, where yin and yang unite in form.

That each flourishes in its eight or nine refers to the Five Phases following the four seasons, each flourishing for seventy-two days—these are the seventy-two seasonal markers. Every five days make a minor marker, and seventy-two days make a major marker.

At the *Beginning of Spring*, wood flourishes for seventy-two days; at the *Beginning of Summer*, fire flourishes for seventy-two days; at the *Beginning of Autumn*, metal flourishes for seventy-two days; at the *Beginning of Winter*, water flourishes for seventy-two days. The four seasons of metal, wood, water, and fire together flourish for a total of two hundred and eighty-eight days.

The center, *wu* and *ji*, is uniquely honored among the four seasons. The *center, wu and ji*, is earth, the twelvefold blackness of the center, which governs the Five Phases and the myriad beings. Earth has no fixed position but is uniquely honored in the four seasons, flourishing for eighteen days in each. For earth harmonizes and nourishes the myriad beings, and thus the center is honored.

In spring, it flourishes with the *taihua* flower for eighteen days; in summer, with the *huaihua* flower for eighteen days; in autumn, with the chrysanthemum for eighteen days; in winter, with the *naidong* flower for eighteen days—together flourishing for seventy-two days. Thus, the Five Phases combine to complete three hundred and sixty days, forming one year.

Earth has the Five Peaks, heaven corresponds to the Five Stars, and humans have the five viscera, each divided accordingly. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—the Five Phases—correspond to the Five Stars; the Five Peaks correspond to the five viscera. All share one body yet are divided by kind.

The Five Peaks of earth are: In the east, the Green Emperor, who gives rise to the myriad beings, with Mount Tai of the eastern peak as the chief of the Five Peaks. In the south, the Red Emperor, who nourishes the myriad beings, with Mount Heng as its peak. In the west, the White Emperor, who presides over harvest and decline, with Mount Hua as its peak. In the north, the Black Emperor, where the myriad beings’ work is completed and they return to their root, with Mount Heng as its peak. In the center, the Yellow Emperor, who harmonizes and nourishes the myriad beings, with Mount Song as its peak. These are the Five Phases of earth.

Heaven corresponds to the Five Stars: In the east, the Wood Virtue Jupiter Star Lord; in the south, the Fire Virtue Mars Star Lord; in the west, the Metal Virtue Venus Star Lord; in the north, the Water Virtue Mercury Star Lord; and in the center, the Earth Virtue Saturn Star Lord. These are the Five Phases of heaven.

The five viscera of humans are the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. The liver corresponds to wood, governing spring and belonging to the east, *jia* and *yi*. The heart governs fire, corresponding to summer and belonging to the south, *bing* and *ding*. The lungs govern metal, corresponding to autumn and belonging to the west, *geng* and *xin*. The kidneys govern water, corresponding to winter and belonging to the north, *ren* and *gui*. The spleen governs earth, corresponding to the four seasons and belonging to the center, *wu* and *ji*. These are the Five Phases of humans.

The Dao of heaven and the transformation of the myriad beings all depend on the Five Phases. Heaven, earth, and humans share one root. All things between heaven and earth receive their *qi* to take form, with the Five Phases as their foundation.

Pure turbidity becomes earth; the nature of heaven is light and clear. Clear *qi* forms heaven, turbid *qi* forms earth. The clear resides above, the turbid below—thus the two *qi* each return to their origin. Earth, turbid, does not disperse; heaven, clear, does not collapse. Heaven is light and clear, taking emptiness and nothingness as its form; earth is turbid and heavy, taking solidity and substance as its shape. Through the Five Phases and yin-yang as their principle, the four seasons revolve without speech, and the myriad beings live and die naturally without contrivance. In these two images of non-action, how could there be collapse or dispersion?

The life and death of humans, the afflictions of the bodily form—all things between heaven and earth share one root. Yet humans and beings undergo birth and extinction, for they are born and must die. Birth is the root of death; death is the foundation of birth. Beings have life, have form; form gives rise to the bodily form. When nature is violated, within the unceasing there lurks the thief of the Dao—lust harms the bodily form. When emotions are violated, there is extinction. Heaven and earth have no birth, no emotions—they are without action.

Yet humans, within heaven and earth, follow their six senses, coveting love, fame, and profit, failing to secure their lives and destinies. Calamities, disasters, illnesses, and suffering arise from entanglement in affairs and attachment to wrongdoing. With scattered spirit and disordered mind, they submit to the ravages of the four seasons, meeting death without awakening.

Know that the wondrous Dao encompasses heaven and earth, bestowing kindness upon the dull and moving, nurturing all sentient beings without fail. Follow heaven and comply with earth—thus the true Dao endures long.

If humans embrace the natural principles of heaven and earth, carefully observing the workings of the four seasons, they may bring peace to the state and abundance to the people, pacifying the four seas. They may bring prosperity to the family and propriety to rites, extending kindness to kin and neighbors. The ruler who attains this may harmonize the myriad states and govern the hundred officials; by upholding the law with rectitude, the common people may become loyal, wise, and sincere. Those who cultivate themselves and attain this may endure for eternal kalpas.

Yet if one favors the perverse and loses the great, the Five Phases will govern and restrain the myriad beings. In their profound and enduring workings through eternal kalpas, the transformations of the Five Phases become the means to govern the state, manage the household, and order agriculture—nothing is disordered. Without this, no affair can be accomplished, and one may depart from the few to become a sage, sharing the same longevity as the Dao.

**Chapter Three: The Mysterious Principle**

The formless is called the Dao; when principle is united, it is called the mysterious. The wondrous Dao is formless, taking heaven as its foundation. Seek the Dao by measuring heavenly principle; heavenly principle unites to form the mysterious mechanism. When the mysterious mechanism is realized and applied, success is achieved, and when merit is complete, it returns to the Dao.

Spring, autumn, winter, and summer—the four seasons are linked. The supreme principle of the Dao is like the revolution of the four seasons in heaven, the fundamental mechanism of the law. The celestial circle of the heavens, the movement of the sun and moon—the celestial circle is the count of one year; the constellations are the twenty-eight lodges. Heaven has the Twelve Palaces of Upper Clarity, within which the lodges and planets are arrayed in degrees. Earth is divided into twelve terrestrial branches, each corresponding to the stellar lodges. Above and below, they illumine one another, like the twelve hours of the day, each hour further divided into quarters.

The Great Dao is empty and primordial, subtly aligning with the principles of heaven. Its divisions and measures, its laws and rules—all reside in oneness. The cycles of the sun and moon, the alternations of yin and yang, the moments of time—how could there be any separation? The qi-cycles and seasonal nodes embody the Dao in its natural course.

The qi-cycles consist of twenty-four qi and seventy-two seasonal markers in a year. Every fifteen days form one qi, every five days form one seasonal marker. The twenty-four qi and seventy-two seasonal markers of the year all correspond to the solar terms. Those who embody the Dao align with the four seasons, the qi-cycles, and the moments of time—this is the foundation of applying the Dao, the mechanism of heaven and earth’s creative transformation. If one holds to heaven while practicing the Dao, the alternations of yin and yang, the qi-cycles, and the moments of time are applied within the body, thereby embodying the Dao in its natural state.

Clouds rise and rain falls; wind and thunder do not remain hidden. Clouds are the qi of earth: when earth’s qi ascends and merges with heaven’s qi, rain is formed. This is because heaven is yang and earth is yin—when yin and yang unite, sweet rain descends. All things are nourished and grow, and none of this occurs without water.

Wind is the harmonious qi of the Five Agents. Gentle and without rigidity, it fulfills the temperaments of the four seasons, giving life to and destroying the myriad things, with hardness and softness prevailing in turn. The four seasons take this as their nature; the myriad things take this as their creative transformation; heaven and earth take this as their constancy; clouds and rain take this as their chariot and steed.

Thunder arises from the collision of the two qi of yin and yang. Earth’s qi belongs to yin, while the darkness of heaven belongs to yang. After the Beginning of Spring, yang qi grows abundant and scorching heat rises above; pure yin qi surges upward, and when cold and heat clash, sound is produced. In winter, there is no thunder because after the Beginning of Autumn, yang qi gradually wanes while yin qi grows abundant. Yang qi dissipates, leaving no scorching heat; yin qi surges upward in its purity, and thus thunder makes no sound. These two images match perfectly, demonstrating the wondrous application of the Dao. Wind and thunder do not remain hidden, for they are the union of yin and yang.

The hundred divisions of day and night complete a year. Each day and night consists of one hundred divisions. Divisions form hours, hours form days, days form months, and months form years. As for the number of breaths in a human: in one division, there are one hundred thirty-five breaths; in ten divisions, one thousand three hundred fifty breaths; in one hundred divisions, thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. Thus, breaths and divisions correspond.

Heaven has its hundred divisions of day and night, which are the mechanism by which yin and yang govern. Humans have their exhalations and inhalations, which are the principle of matching effort in practice. If a perfected person understands the wondrous application of the Dao, how could there be any separation from the Dao of heaven?

The imperial Dao works divine transformations, and its responses are one with heaven. The imperial Dao is the image of the Dao flourishing and virtue prevailing; divine transformation is the auspiciousness of yin and yang’s unfathomable workings. When the Dao flourishes, auspiciousness arises, and responses align with heaven.

When heaven’s Dao flourishes, it responds: yin and yang follow their sequence, the four seasons proceed without error, wind and rain arrive in due time—this is heaven’s auspiciousness. When a sage’s Dao flourishes, it responds: the state and nation enjoy great peace, worthy ministers assist, and celestial spirits manifest—this is the nation’s auspiciousness. When the Dao of self-cultivation flourishes, it responds: one attains long life and enduring vision, clarity and effortless action, and the spirit-soul undergoes transformations—this is the body’s auspiciousness. Thus, the imperial Dao and divine transformation share a single response.

The root gives rise to one ancestor, while branches divide into six sources. The root giving rise to one ancestor refers to the Primordial Unity of qi. All things receive this single qi and are born as two; the two qi form shapes, and the single qi is their root-ancestor.

The branches dividing into six sources refer to the six qi, which are governed by the Five Agents. Heaven has six qi: the winds and rains of the four seasons. Humans have six qi: the *xu* breath belongs to the liver, externally corresponding to wood, temporally to spring, and hexagrammatically to *Zhen*; the *he* breath belongs to the heart, externally corresponding to fire, temporally to summer, and hexagrammatically to *Li*; the *si* breath governs the lungs, externally corresponding to metal, temporally to autumn, and hexagrammatically to *Dui*; the *chui* breath governs the kidneys, externally corresponding to water, temporally to winter, and hexagrammatically to *Kan*; the *hu* breath governs the spleen, externally corresponding to earth, temporally to the four seasons; the *xi* breath governs the Triple Burner, externally corresponding to wind. These are the six qi and their governance. Those who practice refinement must not fail to understand them.

The Fire Dragon plays in the water, while the Metal Tiger flows ceaselessly. The Fire Dragon is the tongue, also called the Red Dragon, which governs the heart. The heart belongs to the southern direction, *bing* and *ding* fire—thus, it is the Fire Dragon. "Playing in the water" refers to the fluids in the mouth. Beneath the tongue lies a vessel called the Jade Spring, within which is the divine water of the Flowery Pond, also known as the Jade Nectar or the True Elixir of Jade Essence. This water does not arrive without qi, and qi does not move without water. The Most High rides the deer-drawn goat cart; immortals call it Jade Nectar, while mortals call it saliva. It is refined into the Golden Elixir and serves as the foundation.

The Metal Tiger belongs to the western direction, called the White Tiger, which internally governs the lungs. The lungs govern qi. In the practice of elixir refinement, qi circulates and fluids flow; fluids flow and qi abounds; qi abounds and the spirit flourishes; the spirit flourishes and the body becomes light. By practicing in accordance with the seasons, after nine years of great effort, the spirit transforms. When the spirit transforms, the form stabilizes; when the form stabilizes, qi stabilizes; when qi stabilizes, the body becomes sacred. When the body becomes sacred, the myriad spirits all attend, and one ascends in transformation, entering effortless action.

The Five Agents reverse, and the four seasons cycle. The reversal of the Five Agents means the intermingling of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—such as water above and fire below, or metal and water alternating—turning and flowing in reversal. The cycling of the four seasons refers to spring, summer, autumn, and winter, like the revolution of heaven’s four seasons, which creates and transforms the myriad things.

Spring, summer, autumn, and winter cycle through the four seasons; qi waxes and wanes with the climate, augmented by intercalary months, circulating endlessly in perpetual return—this is the meaning of cyclical recurrence. The principle of the Great Dao and the mechanism of heaven and earth—how could the movement of the celestial Dao be dual?

In the practice of cultivation, one must not cling to personal cleverness; rather, one should reflect upon the method. Those who do not align with the natural operation of heaven’s principle, but instead obstinately adhere to minor techniques, lead others astray and cannot escape the cycle of life and death.

Through the opening and closing of the Great Dao, the yin and yang of the four seasons are governed, the qi of the solar terms and hours is apportioned, and the myriad things are nurtured, all encompassed within heaven and earth. Yet the methods vary—how then can one attain the longevity of heaven and earth?

The supreme principle of Qian and Kun, the mechanism of the cosmos. The functioning of the Great Dao is one with heaven and earth, its movement of the Five Agents’ true qi in harmony with the four seasons’ ebb and flow—thus is the mechanism of Qian, Kun, and the cosmos spoken of.

Stillness is sublime; refinement is mysterious. Stillness means shedding right and wrong, freeing oneself from attachments, partaking of simple fare and bland flavors, and keeping the heart undisturbed by external chaos—this is the foundation of self-cultivation. Refinement means embracing the principle of heaven and earth, the union of yin and yang, the pairing of the Five Agents, the differentiation of the Four Images, the interplay of water and fire, the floating and sinking of metal and wood, and the blending of the myriad spirits—this is the work of alchemical refinement.

Consuming the elixir and ingesting the black: thus is the immortal ascendant perfected. The saliva in the mouth is the supreme treasure of heaven and earth, the essence of the Five Agents. It nourishes the myriad things, moistens the body, and through it, blood is nurtured; through blood, essence is nurtured; through essence, qi is nurtured; through qi, spirit is nurtured; and through spirit, life is nurtured. Thus, in the refinement of the Golden Elixir, saliva is the foundation.

Ingesting qi is the upright qi of the Five Agents. Heaven and earth operate through the four seasons and day and night; humans rely on the qi and vessels of the five viscera as their root. If one follows the wondrous principle in practice, constantly nourishing the saliva and ingesting qi, once the merit is complete, one ascends to the Golden Towers. Thus does one traverse the realm of emptiness and nothingness!

The foolish remain deluded; the awakened are blessed with affinity.

The deluded, bound to the floating world’s gains and losses, entangle body and mind—how could they know the Dao/Way has its learning, that emptiness and nothingness hold principle? The enlightened, though they may not yet grasp its ultimate truth, first delight in emptiness and nothingness. They examine the heavens and earth, the four seasons, and find their operations governed by principle; they scrutinize the myriad things’ transformations, their arising and ceasing, and find them imbued with sentiment.

If one sets their resolve to study the immortals’ scriptures, they will all attain the wondrous method. When merit is complete and fruit is full, the body realizes the Dao/Way of non-action—thus do they become spirit-immortals by affinity.

The oral instruction states: Regularly, between midnight and noon, face south and sit upright. Collect the spirit, clench the fists, and strike the bell and drum thirty-six times each. Then, using the seasonal dominant qi as the head, circulate the Five Agents’ qi, exhaling stale breath and inhaling saliva. For each season, exhale and inhale seventy-two times, and for earth, ninety times—thus, in one season of three months, the four seasons total three hundred sixty breaths. When complete, add five more breaths, symbolizing the three hundred sixty days of a year plus the remaining five, forming one merit cycle. Then, following the head’s revolution, begin anew. Three merit cycles make one intercalary period, adding thirty breaths, just as three years include one intercalary month.

If the count remains unerring and merit gradually accumulates, naturally the desire for flavors will recede. Hunger is met with qi; thirst, with saliva. The qi of the Five Grains wanes while true qi waxes. After nine years, the spirit transforms.

*Thus concludes the Supreme One’s Scripture on Transforming the Dao/Way and Delivering the World to Immortality.*
