**The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Scripture on the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper for Extending Life and Delivering Humanity**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Scripture on the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper for Extending Life and Delivering Humanity*. The author is unknown, but it likely emerged in the early Northern Song dynasty. It falsely attributes its transmission to the Supreme Venerable Lord (Taishang Laojun), who is said to have imparted it to Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, detailing the rites of offering to the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper for extending life and dispelling calamities. It comprises one scroll. The base text is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* (*Zhengtong Daozang*), under the category of *Original Texts* in the *Section of Numinous Writings* (*Dongshen Bu*).

### **Preface to *The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Scripture on the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper for Extending Life and Delivering Humanity***

Recorded by the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Master, Orthodox Unity Perfected Man Zhang Daoling, along with his disciples, Left Mystery Perfected Man Wang Chang and Right Mystery Perfected Man Zhao Sheng.

The Supreme Venerable Lord of the Great Clarity Realm descended twice to Linqiong in Shu, journeying to Dayi and arriving at Mount Heming. On the first occasion, he bestowed upon the scholar Zhang Daoling the *Twenty-Four Grades of the Orthodox Unity Alliance’s Secret Registers*. On the second, he transmitted the true instructions for the *High Ascension of the Sun and Moon* and the *True Form of Yu Yi and Jie Lin*, along with the *Text of Threefold Eightfold Atonement* for erasing the Black Registers and delivering the Primordial Ancestors.

Daoling had previously obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Cauldron Alchemical Writ* at Mount Song. Later, he secluded himself on Mount Heming, where he prepared medicinal ingredients and, following the prescribed methods, cultivated for three years. When the elixir was complete, he dared not consume it at once. Instead, he addressed his disciple Wang Chang, saying: “The divine elixir is now perfected. If I were to ingest it, I would surely ascend to heaven and become a Perfected One. Yet I lack great virtue. I must first eliminate harm and promote benefit for the state and the people, aiding and succoring the common folk. Only after laboring for their welfare may I consume the elixir, ascend lightly, and serve the Three Realms without shame.”

Thereupon, the Supreme Venerable Lord deigned to descend in his ritual chariot, bestowing true scriptures. After a thousand days of cultivation, Daoling suddenly gained the ability to inwardly perceive his five viscera and outwardly gather the myriad spirits. The Supreme Lord then dispatched the Jade Maiden of Pure Harmony to teach him the art of exhaling and inhaling the *qi* of pure harmony, walking the *Three Steps and Nine Traces*, treading the Dipper and the Heavenly Stem, summoning the Nine Origins, aligning the Seven Governors, and following the direction of the *gang* to subdue and capture demonic essences. By ingesting the *Great Return*, he swiftly eradicated lesser evils. Thus, he waged war against the Six Heavenly Demons, seizing the Twenty-Four Administrations, transforming them into courts of blessing, and renaming them *Realms of Transformation*. He demoted their commanders to the ranks of yin officials, appointing Daoist practitioners to maintain the sacred fires. From then on, day and night were clearly divided, and the paths of humans and ghosts diverged.

Later, in Renshou County of Lingzhou, the Supreme Lord descended with the Twelve Heavenly Wandering Jade Maidens, who transformed the earth into a salt spring, boiling and refining it into salt. The place was henceforth called Lingjun.

When Daoling’s Dao was accomplished, the Supreme Lord descended a third time, bestowing upon him a thousand scrolls of scriptures—all essential teachings for cultivation. These were to be transmitted to those of the Dao, enabling them to attain deliverance in their present bodies and abide eternally. Together, they traveled to Chengdu.

The Supreme Lord rode a dragon chariot, while Daoling mounted a white crane. Suddenly descending through the Five Clouds, they arrived at the site where the Jade Maiden of Taihao refined the Great Elixir. The earth trembled, and a jade platform emerged, over a *zhang* in height. The Supreme Lord ascended the platform, while Daoling prostrated himself below. At that moment, the Supreme Lord expounded the *Scripture of the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper*, revealing the methods for erasing death and extending life. This occurred on the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou* of Emperor Huan of Han (Year of *Yiwei*). By the fifteenth day of the same month—the *Shangyuan* Festival—the Supreme Lord further expounded *The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Scripture on the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper for Extending Life and Delivering Humanity*.

### **The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Scripture on the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper for Extending Life and Delivering Humanity**

At that time, on the fifteenth day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou* (the *Shangyuan* Festival), the Supreme Venerable Lord descended once more to the site in Chengdu where the Jade Maiden of Taihao refined the elixir. The earth spirit again caused a jade platform to rise. Thereupon, the Supreme Lord ascended the platform and addressed Daoling, saying:

“The true writs of the Nine Heavens and Eight Assemblies, the supreme Dao of the Three Caverns and Three Clarities—these were once traversed by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning through seven hundred million kalpas. From the beginning to the end of heaven and earth, from the birth and death of humanity, the shifts of the Five Movements, and the rise and fall of the myriad beings, the Celestial Worthy, abiding in the realm of Supreme Clarity above the Auspicious Clouds, cultivated the perfection of the true and propagated the wondrous Dao. Moved by compassion for living beings and unwilling to abandon his great mercy, he transmitted these scriptures to me in the past. Today, I shall bestow them upon you. You must select those who uphold the Dao and those who cultivate with reverence.

The union of celestial yang and terrestrial yin gives rise to the sun and moon, the Two Luminaries. As the Two Luminaries traverse the Five Wefts and encircle the heavens, they form the Seven Governors—the Seven Stars and Nine Origins of the Northern Dipper. With its handle, it follows the monthly establishment, pointing to the twenty-four solar terms, the twenty-eight lodges, corresponding below to the seventy-two seasonal indicators, the thirty-six creatures, and the lodges containing the six stars of the Dipper constellation. These are called the *Six Offices of the Southern Dipper*. Together with the Seven Governors of the Northern Dipper, they divide their duties, jointly governing the Three Powers, Six Harmonies, Eight Trigrams, and Nine Palaces, overseeing all officials and ranks within and beyond. They are the central bureaus of the Purple Tenuity and Supreme Subtlety Palaces, linked above to the twelve celestial divisions of the true numinous spirits and below to the twelve terrestrial divisions of the earthly deities. The Four Waterways, Five Marchmounts, Nine Provinces, Eight Cords, famous mountains and great rivers, city gods and earth altars—all beings, all things, and all people are recorded in their registers and held in their grasp.

The Northern Dipper resides in the *Kan* Palace, sharing its name with the moon. The spirit it bestows upon humans is called the *po*. It presides over the yin府, governing the sources of water, and its merit in aiding the flourishing of life is unparalleled. The Southern Dipper resides in the *Li* Palace, sharing its name with the sun. The spirit it bestows upon humans is called the *hun*. It presides over the yang offices, governing the Fire Emperor, and its virtue in aiding activity and utility is unmatched.

Since the inception of heaven and earth until now, these two offices and two poles have jointly molded and shaped the myriad kinds, giving life to the myriad things. They assign ranks to heaven and humanity, augment or diminish the stipends of officials and commoners, extend or shorten lifespans, and determine the departure or retention of calamities and blessings—all subject to their granting or withholding.”

Thus it is so: we know that the sun belongs to yang and the moon to yin, and that the Southern and Northern Dippers, the stalwart and guiding constellations, receive their nature from water and fire, and their substance from yin and yang. They assist heaven and earth in nurturing the myriad things, embody their virtue and power to shed light, and through them, things flourish abundantly—without them, what else could achieve this? Through them, humans receive life—without them, what else could bring it forth?

Therefore, the Heavenly Venerable, with earnest compassion, gazes upon you, all beings possessing spirit, as if you were newborn infants. He opens the path of salvation and protection, commanding the preservation of your inherent nature. The method of salvation and protection is this: let all good men and good women, regardless of rank, wholeheartedly and constantly revere and gaze upon the sun and moon, the Southern and Northern Dippers whenever they appear. They should bow earnestly, kowtow, and pray for protection, beseeching blessings and grace, addressing them thus: "Most Sacred and Venerable True Lord and True Sovereign." They should plead for mercy amid their worldly burdens, seeking pardon for transgressions and faults, then bow again. They must not harbor negligence or disrespect, lest they invite misfortune and trouble.

The Old Lord said: "You men and women who can follow my teachings and act accordingly—if you have petitions to make, seeking to dispel calamities, transcend adversity, increase blessings, prolong life, preserve the unity of your household, or pray for the peace of your borders; if you wish to avoid litigation, alter fate from death to life—you should submit memorials, present petitions, and hold jiao rites. Whatever you seek shall be granted without fail."

Thereupon, the Old Lord proclaimed again to Dao-ling:
*"The Southern Dipper’s Fire Office dispels poison and harm,*
*The Northern Dipper’s Water Spirit eradicates misfortune and disaster.*
*All that is sought shall be fulfilled,*
*Every stagnation and distress shall be unblocked.*
*If one follows the scripture’s method and holds the jiao with a devoted heart,*
*Wishes shall surely align with the numinous mind.*
*All who constantly revere with purity—*
*No misfortune or calamity shall dare approach."*

The Old Lord said: "The wonders of the divine transcend mortal understanding. The foolish among humankind value the distant and disdain the near. The near is the body itself: the eyes see the sun, moon, and stars; the ears hear the wind, thunder, and refined music; the nose discerns orchid and musk from foul odors; the tongue distinguishes sweet, bitter, sour, and pungent; the mouth utters speech and sound. From birth to old age, even the actions of hands and feet cannot be separated from water and fire. Yet mortals see these as if they do not, hear these words as if deaf. They fail to realize that the very foundation of life and nature is bestowed by heaven and earth, the sun and moon, and the stars, borrowing from the Four Great Elements, all rooted in this single qi. The generation of life depends entirely on water and fire, which are akin to the true essence of the Dao. Thus, they cannot be momentarily separated. That which can be separated and still endure is neither thing nor person.

"I now earnestly impress upon the men and women of the world this essential Dao, universally urging them to awaken their hearts, seek, and make offerings through jiao rites. Know that divine beings exist; trust my teachings. Furthermore, during the four seasons’ first days of the month, the eight solar terms, the twenty-four qi, the Three Origins, the Three Assemblies, the Five La Days, and one’s own birthdays—these auspicious times and days—you may submit memorials, present petitions, make offerings, beseech blessings, give thanks, repent sins to dispel calamities, light lamps, offer fruits, make devotions, and invoke the deities. The blessings thereof are boundless.

**Southern Dipper:**
1. First Star: Heavenly Office, Controller of Life, Supreme General, True Lord Who Mirrors the State
2. Second Star: Heavenly Minister, Controller of Records, Supreme Minister, True Lord Who Mirrors the Mountains
3. Third Star: Heavenly Beam, Prolonger of Life, Protector of Destiny
4. Fourth Star: Heavenly Union, Benefactor of Longevity, Protector of Life
5. Fifth Star: Heavenly Pivot, Dispeller of Adversity, Literary Prosperity, Refiner of Souls
6. Sixth Star: Heavenly Mechanism, Supervisor of Life, Recorder, Great Judge

Write these six talismans in cinnabar: men wear them on the left, women on the right. They grant long life and freedom from all disasters."

The Dao declares: "The Six Star True Lords, the Six Star Lads, and the Fire Bell Generals—when people recite this scripture, they must do so with utmost sincerity and devout prayer. There shall be no lack of response. Only through diligence, submitting memorials, and presenting petitions will the true sages descend, and one shall surely attain longevity and the Dao-nature of eternal life."

The Old Lord said: "These Six Office True Lords are swift in their divine nature. If one seeks with a sincere heart, no wish shall go unfulfilled. The divine beings respond to human hearts, and all matters shall harmonize accordingly.

"Moreover, the root of all practices and the foundation of the body lie in preserving the Dao and qi to secure form and life. The preservation of form and life depends on teachings, and teachings reside in the meticulousness of rituals and protocols. Sound elicits response; form elicits shadow. Form follows the heart’s movement; every step and action is subtly divine. The Southern and Northern Dippers mold the *po* and forge the *hun*. Once the *hun* is refined, it transmigrates and is reborn. If one follows my teachings, repents past wrongs, remedies future shortcomings, washes away myriad calamities, and welcomes a hundred blessings—this depends solely on reverence, purity, and wholehearted devotion. One shall surely attain the immortal Dao of transcending the world, sharing the same lifespan as the sun and moon.

"If there are deeply faithful individuals who can establish altars for the Two Poles and Two Dippers, holding a joint jiao rite, erecting images of the Dipper stars, setting up altar pillars, arranging incense and lamps, spreading clean thatch, and offering fruits and foods such as sugar cakes, oil cakes, lotus-leaf steamed buns, milk-steamed buns, fried jujube soup, and fine tea—without need for wine or dried meat—this is the most essential Dao. Through this, one welcomes the divine beings, and the true sages, delighted, shall descend to bestow their blessings and protection."

Hereupon, as the Old Lord concluded this wondrous scripture, the Heavenly Master Dao-ling and all his disciples bowed in reverence, giving thanks, and pledged to receive and uphold it.

*Thus concludes The Wondrous Scripture of the Southern Dipper’s Six Offices for Prolonging Life and Delivering Humankind, as Spoken by the Most High.*
