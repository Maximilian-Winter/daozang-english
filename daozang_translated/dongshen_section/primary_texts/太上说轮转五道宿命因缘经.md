**Title:** *Sutra of the Five Paths of Transmigration and the Causes and Conditions of Past Lives as Spoken by the Most High*. The author is unknown, but it appears to date from the Tang dynasty. It is attributed to the Most High Lord Lao, who expounds on the causes and conditions of past lives to the Left Mystery Perfected One and others. One scroll.

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao was dwelling in a pure abode in the kingdom of Kapilavastu, accompanied by twelve hundred and fifty celestial immortals, earthly immortals, immortal youths, and jade maidens. Having completed the nine-month long fast, he emerged from the divine abode and traveled to the Jetavana Grove in the kingdom of Śrāvastī, the Garden of Anāthapiṇḍada.

Between the two kingdoms stood a great tree named Śikhin, towering one thousand eight hundred and sixty *li* in height, its branches and leaves spreading to cover an area six hundred and thirty *li* in circumference. Upon this tree grew tens of millions of fruits, each as large as a stone, sweet and fragrant to the taste, like honey. When the ripe fruits fell, the people who ate them found all illnesses cured and their ears and eyes sharpened in clarity.

As we sat beneath the tree, the assembled immortals gathered the fruits to eat. Then the Left Mystery Perfected One addressed the immortals, saying: "I observe that all things between heaven and earth possess their own causes and conditions from past lives."

The immortals then stepped forward, bowed in reverence, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "What are these causes and conditions of past lives? We, your disciples, wish to hear of them. Pray, expound upon them in full to enlighten those who have not yet heard."

The Perfected One replied: "Excellent. If there are those who delight in hearing, listen single-mindedly and with care."

The Dao spoke: "A person’s accumulation of blessings is like this tree—small at first, then gradually growing vast, bearing boundless fruit. Those who in this life are noble and exalted, becoming emperors, kings, lords, or regional governors, descend from those who in past lives revered the Three Treasures. Those who in this life are immensely wealthy, with limitless riches, descend from those who in past lives practiced generosity. Those who in this life enjoy long life, free from illness, descend from those who in past lives upheld the precepts. Those who in this life are comely, with radiant complexions, peerless in grace, their hands and feet supple and graceful—so that all who see them rejoice and never tire of gazing—descend from those who in past lives cultivated forbearance. Those who in this life are diligent, never idle, descend from those who in past lives accumulated merit through unflagging effort. Those who in this life are composed, their words and deeds measured and precise, descend from those who in past lives refined their thoughts through meditation. Those who in this life are wise, penetrating the scriptures and dharma, extolling the sublime teachings, awakening the benighted—so that all who hear their words receive and cherish them—descend from those who in past lives cultivated wisdom. Those who in this life possess voices of crystalline clarity descend from those who in past lives chanted and praised the Three Treasures. Those who in this life are pure and free from illness descend from those who in past lives nurtured a heart of compassion."

The assembled immortals then addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "What is a heart of compassion?"

The Left Mystery Perfected One replied: "First, to cherish all beings as a mother loves her child. Second, to wish that all beings in the world attain freedom. Third, to comprehend the Dao’s intent and abide in constant joy. Fourth, to refrain from all evil. This is a heart of compassion."

The Dao continued: "Those who in this life are beautiful descend from those who in past lives treated others with reverence. Those who in this life are ugly descend from those who in past lives indulged in anger. Those who in this life are ignorant descend from those who in past lives neglected study. Those who in this life are dull-witted and obtuse descend from those who in past lives refused to teach others. Those who in this life are mute or speech-impaired descend from those who in past lives slandered the innocent. Those who in this life are deaf or blind descend from those who in past lives disdained the scriptures and refused to listen to the teachings. Those who in this life are slaves or servants descend from those who in past lives left debts unpaid and failed to revere the Three Treasures. Those who in this life are dark and unsightly descend from those who in past lives obscured the light. Those who in this life are born among the naked peoples descend from those who in past lives disdained clothing, exposing themselves in sacred precincts. Those who in this life are born among the horse-hoofed peoples descend from those who in past lives regretted their acts of generosity and charity. Those who in this life are born among deer and muntjacs descend from those who in past lives startled others with fear. Those who in this life fall among dragons descend from those who in past lives delighted in frivolous play. Those who in this life suffer from festering sores, leprosy, or incurable afflictions—untreatable by medicine, their agony beyond words—descend from those who in past lives unjustly whipped living beings. Those who in this life are shunned, unwelcome to others, descend from those who in past lives showed no joy in the presence of others. Those who in this life are beloved, inspiring reverence and affection, descend from those who in past lives delighted in the company of others. Those who in this life are repeatedly seized by officials, imprisoned, their bodies broken by cangues and fetters, descend from those who in past lives unjustly confined and bound living beings, denying them freedom. Those who in this life are harelipped descend from those who in past lives sat with hooks in the mouths of fish. Such transgressions must not be taken lightly.

The Dao declared: "In this world, fools who hear kind and virtuous words yet take no pleasure in them, instead sowing discord with slander, shall in the next life become dogs with yapping, echoing barks. Those who hear the scriptures yet fail to heed them shall in the next life fall among donkeys. Those who are miserly, hoarding food for themselves, shall in the next life fall among hungry ghosts; if they are reborn among humans, they will be solitary, impoverished, starving, clothed in rags, unable to feed themselves. Those who delight in eating yet offer others only foul food shall in the next life be reborn as pigs, swine, or dung beetles. Those who rob others of their wealth, stripping them of their clothing, shall in the next life fall among sheep, where others will flay their skins to repay their past sins. Those who take pleasure in killing, spending their lives fishing, shall in the next life become mayflies upon the water, born at dawn and dead by dusk. Those who steal others’ possessions without cause shall in the next life be reborn as slaves, servants, oxen, or horses. Those who lust after others’ wives, heedless of sun, moon, and stars, shall upon death plunge directly into hell, where men embrace copper pillars and women lie upon iron beds. If they are reborn, they will surely fall among chickens and ducks. Those who delight in falsehood, twisting others’ virtues into vices, shall upon death plunge directly into hell, where molten copper will be poured into their mouths, their tongues torn out and plowed by oxen. If they are reborn, they will become owls and vultures, their cries striking terror into all who hear them; all will call them omens of misfortune and curse them to death. Those who indulge in wine and intoxication, committing the thirty-six transgressions, shall upon death fall into the hell of mud and excrement. If they are reborn, they will be utterly foolish, knowing nothing. Those whose marriages are discordant, who quarrel and drive each other away, shall in the next life fall among turtledoves. Those who exploit others’ labor shall in the next life take the form of elephants.

The Dao continued: "If those who serve as prefects or magistrates, drawing their sustenance from office and their emoluments from rank, privately extort from the people, beating and flogging them, compelling forced deliveries—so that their grievances go unheard, their punishments unchecked, and no leniency is shown—"

Such persons bear grave sins; upon death, they descend directly into hell, where their spirits endure a hundred pains for tens of millions of kalpas. Only after their sins are exhausted may they be reborn—then as water buffaloes, their noses pierced and yoked, made to pull heavy carts while great rods strike them, repaying their past transgressions.

The Dao continued: "Those who in this life are human yet do not bathe—such persons come from swine, pigs, or dung beetles in a former existence. Those who in this life are miserly and greedy, refusing to yield and speaking harshly—such persons come from vicious dogs in a former existence. Those who in this life are cruel, obstinate, and self-willed—such persons come from sheep in a former existence. Those who in this life speak rashly and cannot endure hardship—such persons come from macaques in a former existence. Those whose bodies in this life reek of stench—such persons come from fish and turtles in a former existence. Those who in this life rush toward evil and harbor venomous hearts—such persons come from vipers in a former existence. Those who in this life delight in preparing fine foods, slaughtering living beings, and lack all compassion—such persons come from jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards in a former existence. Those born in this life among the frontier lands of the Six Barbarian tribes—such persons, in a former existence, did not believe in the Dao and its teachings. Those whose backs in this life are hunched—such persons, in a former existence, did not fully prostrate themselves when worshipping the Three Treasures. Those who in this life suffer frequent illnesses and undergo much acupuncture—such persons, in a former existence, were physicians who applied needles and moxibustion, sometimes curing, sometimes worsening conditions, yet took others’ possessions in payment.

The Dao continued: "Those who in this life are well-ordered in conduct, adorned with literary grace, upright in principle, rich in wisdom, and able to expound wondrous meanings—such persons, in a former existence, propagated the true teachings and come from the heavens. Those who in this life are learned, clear in understanding, intelligent, and free from greed—such persons come from immeasurable kalpas of accumulated merit in a former existence. Those whose complexions in this life are fair and bright—such persons, in a former existence, delighted in offering banners and flowers to the Three Treasures. Those whose bodies and breath in this life are fragrant and pure—such persons, in a former existence, committed no transgressions and spoke no evil, hence their present state. Those who in this life die by fire—such persons, in a former existence, delighted in setting fires and burning living beings. Those who in this life drown—such persons, in a former existence, without cause cast living beings into water. Those who in this life hang themselves—such persons, in a former existence, without cause bound living beings with ropes. Those who in this life are killed by fierce tigers or venomous snakes—such persons, in a former existence, without cause accepted bribes to kill others. Those who in this life are struck dead by thunderbolts—such persons, in a former existence, committed many evils, reviled their elders, disrespected their parents, and defiled the Three Luminaries. Those who in this life remain solitary into old age, without sons—such persons, in a former existence, secretly harbored malice and envied others’ children and grandchildren. Those who in this life are short-lived, their births marred by miscarriage or premature death, dying before their time—such persons shall remain in the Three Wretched Realms for tens of millions of kalpas before they may emerge.

The Dao continued: "Those whose eyes in this life are blind in one eye—such persons, in a former existence, disliked reading scriptures and collecting alms from the elderly. Those who in this life are skilled artisans, constructing and repairing with craftsmanship—such persons come from the palaces of the heavens in a former existence. Those who in this life are clear and penetrating in understanding, with voices of wondrous tone—such persons, in a former existence, delighted in listening to and teaching the scriptures and their precepts. Those who in this life are blind, deaf, or lack the six senses—such persons, in a former existence, delighted in mocking others and living beings. Those who in this life lose their parents early and remain solitary—such persons, in a former existence, killed others’ parents. Those born into separation, scattered in foreign lands, reduced to lowly status, enslaved and driven—such persons, in a former existence, delighted in banditry, breaking into homes, blocking roads, seizing people, beating and binding them, selling them into servitude, causing their parents anguish so profound their livers and hearts shattered, their deaths bringing no relief. Thus do they now repay their past sins.

The Perfected One of the Left Mystery said: "I have witnessed the karmic retributions of past lives—how clear they are! One must be cautious."

The Dao continued: "Those who perform meritorious deeds should personally offer incense, blessings, and food, and recite scriptures. Do not invite others to eat on your behalf, lest your vows remain unfulfilled. If you rely on others for your meals, how can you ever be sated? Reflect well on performing good deeds and bestowing kindness."

The Perfected One of the Left Mystery said: "Burning incense, practicing the Dao, observing fasts, reciting scriptures, lighting lamps to continue the light, and fulfilling vows—these should be regular practices of almsgiving. Through them, one gains merit, attains wisdom, and becomes free from hindrances. The divine generals will welcome you, all evils will dissipate, and the myriad demons will not dare to oppose you. Those who are indolent and lack diligence—when illness strikes, no good fortune remains. Only then do they think to burn incense and perform good deeds, but evil has already descended, and demons stand guard, competing to manifest strange omens. For this reason, one must always be diligent. Karmic retribution follows a person like a shadow or echo."

The Dao continued: "Cultivating the field of merit is like planting a *śimbali* tree—how many roots did you sow? The various immortals then stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Most High, saying: 'Originally, there was but one root, yet gradually it grew, yielding limitless seeds.' The Most High said to the immortals: 'Giving one brings ten thousandfold in return—were these words empty?' Then the Dao proclaimed in verse:

The worthy delight in almsgiving,
Heavenly spirits naturally support them.
Give one, receive ten thousandfold,
Enjoying peace, longevity, and long life.
Bestow kindness upon good people today,
Their merit is immeasurable.
All shall attain the Dao of immortality,
Liberating the beings of the ten directions.

The Most High addressed the various immortals: "Worldly people, lacking wisdom and possessing only the fleshly eyes of life and death, do not understand karmic retribution. With the eye of the Dao, I have witnessed countless kalpas, up to the present day."

The karmic retribution of sin and blessing is as clear as beholding a jewel of lapis lazuli in the palm—no doubt lingers within or without.

Then the various heavenly immortals rose, adjusted their robes, and bowed to address the Most High, saying: "Though you have expounded this principle, we have yet to fully comprehend it. We humbly beseech further enlightenment."

The Most High replied: "This is called *The Sutra of the Five Paths’ Turning Wheel: Karmic Retribution of Past-Life Causes and Conditions*. If good men and good women are able to recite, chant, and propagate it, their merit shall be boundless."

At that time, the Left Mystic Perfected and the various heavenly immortals, along with the people of the world who had heard this sutra, all rejoiced greatly. Each arose according to their karmic conditions, circumambulated three times, bowed in reverence, and withdrew.

Thus concludes *The Most High’s Sutra of the Turning Wheel of the Five Paths: Karmic Retribution of Past-Life Causes and Conditions*.
