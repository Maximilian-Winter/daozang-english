The *Supreme Vast Origin Scripture*

The Most High Lord Lao said:
Vast Origin, Supreme Perfection—such is the body of the noble man.
Above and below, the Three Offices guard and nurture the spirit.
With radiant harmony, observe the breath, exhaling the old, inhaling the new.
Cultivate reality and attain permanence, ascending as an immortal.

The Cavern Chamber, resplendent and intricate, connects above and below.
Within it, the golden furnace and jade table are set;
retreat three inches to feed the Mysterious Orifice,
then return to dwell in the Crimson Palace of the Central Field.
Firmly guard the Spirit Gate, where the spring and abyss merge.
Cultivate these three, and ever shall you thrive.

Crimson-robed spirit guests, luminous and serene,
if you can practice this, your life shall know no end.
The golden cap and plain canopy form unyielding strength,
nourishing below the Mysterious Pool and soaking the Chamber of the Po.
Within, the Spirit Terrace rises, the Hall of Light stands firm.
Regulate and refine the effects of the Great Granary;
let essence and qi circulate, strengthening the Five Spirits.
With breath unbroken, ascend to the azure heavens.

The spirit of the Upper Prime Youth, essence of the gods,
clad in crimson robes and vermilion sash, dwells in the Yellow Court.
The Old Man of the Southern Pole, you who cultivate and nurture,
preserve the spirit and pacify the nature to attain longevity.

The spirit of the Lower Prime is named Valley Mystery,
the True Man of the Northern Pole, foremost in the Dao.
Guard the Golden Spirit of the Emperor, sovereign of the Five Viscera.
Ever hold the jade spoon, seated in the golden lungs.
Stir the essence, feed the One, and the Golden Earth shall store the honored Kun.
Cherish the precious encircling fat, returning from decline to flourish by the yellow.

The Spirit Tortoise and Jade Maiden dwell at the center,
recording life on the left, fate on the right, flanked by the Two.
They command the Six Dings and dispel a hundred misfortunes,
erasing the register of death to extend your destiny.

The Sweet Spring may be drunk, brimming with jade nectar.
Serene and desireless, the will remains unshaken.
Jade fans and golden keys quiet the many doors;
with harmonious breath, life’s subtleties arise.
Return to truth, revert to simplicity—the mechanism of youth.
Sever attachment, flee desire, and the spirit will be whole.

Smooth and lustrous, the essence-fluid ever radiant,
exchange qi, renew marrow, and ascend to life.
The Dao accomplished, form transformed, the body soars aloft.
The heart’s spirit darts past the Nine Heavens in an instant.
Pacify the spirit, stabilize the po, and cultivate this Way.
Refine thought, empty the spirit—this is my teaching.

The Supreme Perfection’s divine elixir has long been perfected,
the spirit’s countenance youthful, its hue ever fresh.
The Three Ones’ habitual qi fortifies the root of the spirit.
Regulate the Five, penetrate the Seven, and the gods shall be strong.
Expand the hidden passes, the Dao’s myriad sources.
With mighty qi, awe-inspiring, cultivate the Kunlun.

The Upper Palace, crimson-wrapped, adorned with tassels;
the Middle Palace, vermilion-clad, solemn and majestic;
the Lower Palace, cinnabar-robed, guarding the Gate of Essence.
Examine and practice this, and you shall equal Qian.
