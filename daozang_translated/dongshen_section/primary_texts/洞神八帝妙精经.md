### **The Method of Fasting and Upholding the Eight Precepts**

The Divine Emperor said: All movement and stillness, departure and arrival, and the reckoning of good and evil are bound to the interplay of the Three and the Five. Though their names are shared, their affairs differ; they proceed in alternation, mutually governing and encompassing one another, yet ultimately returning to a single source.

This single source is profound and obscure, deep and distant, difficult to swiftly attain, for its conditions and experiences are manifold. Many methods are employed to govern many desires, yet desires cannot be abruptly dispelled. They must be restrained, severed, and diminished day by day. Diminish them again and again, until reaching non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone; when nothing is left undone, desires are no longer true desires.

Desires are for the benefit of others; when one no longer requires anything for oneself, what one requires is already sufficient. Sufficiency lies within oneself, without harm to others; when others suffer no harm, one benefits in turn. Benefiting others is not for the sake of augmentation; both augmentation and diminution naturally cease. I am without augmentation or diminution—augmentation and diminution belong to things.

When things follow their nature, they benefit themselves; it is not I who benefit them. When things resist their nature, they harm themselves; it is not I who harm them. Harm and benefit are not of my doing, yet I am the master of harm and benefit. The master does not seek me; it is things that seek me. By enabling resonance to generate transformation, transformation aligns things with their nature.

Alignment begins with guarding stillness; stillness stabilizes movement, and movement arises from the stability of stillness. The steps to stability are founded upon fasting, and fasting urgently requires order and harmony. Urgency lies in harmonizing body and mind; when body and mind are harmonized, one is preserved from chaos and ruin.

Ruin arises from many causes, but its major forms are eight:
1. Killing living beings to sustain oneself,
2. Stealing from others to supply oneself,
3. Indulging in lust and desire,
4. Boasting of one’s abilities with false speech,
5. Drinking to intoxication and self-gratification,
6. Reclining on high, broad, and grand beds,
7. Competing in the enjoyment of fragrant adornments and floral ornaments,
8. Indulging in song, dance, and lewd performances.

Those who rouse their minds and study the sagely Perfected Immortals do not engage in these eight affairs. If these eight affairs do not arise, then the eight forms of ruin have no means to emerge; when the eight forms of ruin do not emerge, the eight forms of accomplishment naturally arise.

If these endure without loss, one prolongs life and preserves destiny, attaining divine penetration and thorough understanding, profound wisdom and insight. One may conceal or reveal oneself, harmonizing with the world’s brilliance.

Thus, in fasting, one receives and upholds the Eight Precepts:
- By not killing, the ruin of karmic retribution does not arise, and the accomplishment of compassion and longevity naturally stands;
- By not stealing, the ruin of poverty and humiliation does not arise, and the accomplishment of wealth and humility naturally stands;
- By not engaging in lust, the ruin of loneliness and sorrow does not arise, and the accomplishment of chastity and purity naturally stands;
- By not lying, the ruin of deception and injustice does not arise, and the accomplishment of awakening and integrity naturally stands;
- By not becoming intoxicated, the ruin of confusion and madness does not arise, and the accomplishment of wisdom and clarity naturally stands;
- By not reclining on high, broad beds, the ruin of delusion and fear of death does not arise, and the accomplishment of purity and fearlessness naturally stands;
- By not coveting fragrant adornments and floral ornaments, the ruin of entanglement and ruin does not arise, and the accomplishment of radiance and liberation naturally stands;
- By not indulging in song, dance, and lewd performances, the ruin of sorrow and agitation does not arise, and the accomplishment of harmony and gentleness naturally stands.

When these forms of ruin do not arise and these accomplishments naturally stand, they follow like a shadow follows form—never erring. By ensuring the eight forms of ruin do not arise and the eight accomplishments naturally stand, practicing fasting and upholding precepts, wearing divine talismans, contemplating the Real, and practicing the Dao, one attains boundless penetration. Manifestations will swiftly appear, all as expected.

### **The Scripture of the Three Sovereigns and the Three Ones**

What the Three Sovereigns received lies fundamentally in the Three Ones: the Grand One, the Real One, and the Mysterious One—these are called the Three Ones. They are also named the Three Primes. The primordial *qi* generates the spirit; the spirit-*qi* descends into humanity, and humanity becomes spirit.

The upper Prime spirit in the head is named Yuanxian. It is the Lord of the Grand One, not the heart but a celestial spirit. Guarding it unites one with Heaven; uniting with Heaven, one is called a Divine Person. This spirit is also named the Old Man of the Southern Culmen and resides in the Palace of the Grand One.

Three *cun* directly below the crown of the head is the Palace of the Grand Culmen, also called the Palace of the Grand One. At dawn, sunrise, and noon on *jia-wu* days, call out: *"Southern Culmen Yuanxian, Lord of the Grand One, I seek the divine elixir and the Dao of longevity."* Then close the eyes and visualize the Grand One’s youth within the heart, clad in crimson robes, his *qi* a radiant red-yellow like the sun. After ninety breaths, cease.

The middle Prime spirit in the heart is named Xuanjian. It is the Lord of the Grand One of the Central Culmen, residing in the spleen, which is the Jade Hall—also called the Reclining Chamber of the Grand One in the Jade House. It nurtures the body’s essence.

At cockcrow, mealtime, mid-afternoon, and dusk on *wu-chen*, *wu-xu*, *ji-wei*, and *ji-chou* days, call out: *"Central Culmen Xuanjian, Lord of the Grand One, I seek the Dao of the Yellow Court and the immortality of the Perfected."* Then close the eyes and visualize yellow *qi* filling the chest, with a person above the spleen. After fifty breaths, cease.

The lower Prime spirit below the navel is named Xuanmiao. She is the Mother of the Mysterious Dao of the Northern Culmen. The kidneys are the Palace of Dual Union, opposite the Southern Culmen above, hence named the Northern Culmen.

At midnight on *jia-zi*, *wu-zi*, *bing-zi*, *geng-zi*, and *ren-zi* days, call out: *"Mother of the Mysterious Dao of the Northern Culmen, I seek the golden liquid and the sweet spring that may be consumed."* Then close the eyes and visualize white *qi* between the kidneys, within which is a divine turtle. Above the turtle is a Mysterious Woman; to her right is the Director of Destinies, and to her left is the Recorder. Upon seeing them, call out: *"Jade Maiden of the Six *Ding*, erase my name from the register of death and inscribe it in the jade record of longevity."*

Invoke the spirits by repeating their names twice, then declare: *"I seek long life."* Knowing the names of the three spirits and cultivating them according to the proper days and hours, one may prolong life, escape death, achieve transformation, and attain immortality as a divine transcendent.

These three spirits are the Heavenly Divine Lord, the Three Primordials’ Noble Spirits, and the ancestors of humankind. Constantly recall them without forgetfulness; in solitude, still the heart and visualize them. Their forms appear crimson. When among others, their attire and crowns are distinct, each with their own colors, vividly manifest.

The Great One (*Taiyi*) is the essence of the womb and embryo, the master of transformation. The hun and po souls arise from the womb spirit, while the life-*qi* emerges from the embryonic palace. United with the Imperial Lord, they blend and transform to become human. Thus, the spirit of the Great One is the mother of life, and the Imperial Lord’s majesty is the father. Father and mother are originally united, called the Primordial *Qi*; when they respond and divide in form, they are named father and mother. The mother is called the Great One, named *Wuyoushou*, styled *Guihuichang*, also known as *Jieming*, and by another name, *Jifan*. Knowing these names, guard them closely and do not reveal them to others. Keep them within yourself, and you shall attain long life without death.

The Imperial Lord is named *Fenglingfan*, styled *Lüchanglingshen*. Those who know this will not descend into the earth; jade lads and jade maidens shall attend them into the Nine Heavens. The heavenly spirits are the children of this Imperial Lord. The Imperial Lord governs the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Ultimate Palace, uniting with the Great One. He is also called the Great One Primordial Lord, neither male nor female, radiant with ineffable brilliance. Sometimes he appears as the Venerable Lord (*Laojun*), sometimes as the Divine Youth (*Yingxiong*), responding to all without limit, transforming without end.

**Nine Yang Songs**
Abstain and uphold the precepts, guard the One and harmonize the spirits.
When essence reaches afar, the Nine Heavenly Thearchs dispatch divine lads to descend, attending and recording the charts. They command the Mysterious Woman to chant the Nine Yang Songs, to propagate the wondrous *qi*, dispel misfortune, and spread blessings. When practitioners circumambulate during their Daoist practices, they should recite these songs to unite with the spirits in resonance.

**Clear Melody of the Yang Song**
Floating, it pervades the ten directions.
Lush and verdant, myriad blossoms gleam,
Bearing me to the ninefold heavens.
The western string lifts its tune,
Awakening the Eastern King of Men.
The Primordial Cavern initiates the movement,
The first yang sprouts ten thousand buds.
Harmonious winds stir the jade branches,
Lofty forests shimmer with cloudy veils.
*Jumang* urges the planting of goodness,
*Riyu* illumines the eastern expanse.
Immortal sages wander the Mysterious Garden,
Soaring chants arise from jasper flutes.
They rein in their light in the chambers of rosy clouds,
Aligning their wheels in the Nine Heavenly Courts.
All immortals raise their soaring chants,
The Yang Songs flow in timely strains.
Without the virtue of a numinous being,
How could one pay homage to the immortals?

**Harmonious Yin-Yang Song**
The Two Modes receive their mandate from Heaven.
Dwelling in stillness, the mind aspires to transcendence,
Unmoved by worldly entanglements.
Before one realizes the vastness of soaring beyond,
Already one has surpassed the lofty and profound.
Sighing at those who rush in competition,
Unaware of nurturing the root of life.
Lush and flourishing, the yang thrives,
Chanting and intoning the southern golden beam.
Warm winds brush the treetops,
Crimson phoenixes soar in mutual flight.
Heavenly chants rise on the void,
Carefree, they perform the Nine Songs.
They harness their steeds to the beauty of white forests,
Command the rhythm by striking golden bells.
Phoenixes sing in harmony with the eight tones,
True splendor graces jade countenances.
Above the immortal chambers of the Yang Songs,
Flutes and panpipes follow in accompaniment.
I harmonize with myself—
Who can fathom this profound resonance?
Wandering the tips of Kunlun and Penglai,
Far and distant, they sport in the Mysterious Capital.
Serene and lofty, the immortal guests,
Graceful and refined, they chant the Yang Songs.
In unison, they sing to the nine strings,
Virtue aligns with the wondrous harmony.
Bright lamps extend the long night,
Mysterious radiance illuminates the secluded hall.
Soaring chants rise beyond the phoenix grove,
Pure winds caress jade pendants.
Yang Songs interweave in song,
The four pavilions gleam with vermilion light.
Fiery and vast, the Court of Broad Cold,
Distant and boundless, the chambers of the transcendent swallow.
The Dark and Abysmal sings the Yang Song,
The Eight Sceneries emerge through the clouds.
Refining and bathing in the essence of yang,
They chant the Great One in long melodies.
Without steadfast resolve and virtue,
How could one delight in distant reclusion?

**Chart of the Nine August Ones**
**First Heavenly August One**
The Heavenly August Lord is nine inches tall, draped in a green brocade cloak, wearing a green brocade skirt, crowned with the Nine Heavens’ Treasure Diadem, and holds a Jade Scepter of Ascension.

**First Earthly August One**
The Earthly August Lord is nine inches tall, draped in a white brocade cloak, wearing a white brocade skirt, crowned with the Three Dawns’ Jade Diadem, and holds the Scepter of Primordial August Record.

**First Human August One**
The Human August Lord is nine inches tall, draped in a yellow brocade cloak, wearing a yellow brocade skirt, crowned with the Seven-Colored Treasure Diadem, and holds the Jade Scepter of Supreme August Protection.

The first Three August Ones are the transformations of the Void and Emptiness, responding in resonance with humanity, alike yet distinct. Practitioners should visualize them, without mingling male and female forms, and avoid treading upon defilement. Violations shall be adjudicated by the Left Bureau. After three years without transgression, the spirits shall descend to converse, bestow the secrets of long life, and grant ascent to the Three Clarities’ Palaces.

**Middle Heavenly August One**
The Heavenly August Lord has a human face and a serpent’s body, with thirteen heads. He emerged to govern on the eighth day of the eleventh month in the first year of *Pingchu*. His surname is *Wang*, given name *Huo*, styled *Run*. He commands an army of 100,900,000 from the green clouds, governing 120 *chi* demons in the clouds, 1,200 wandering ghostly bandits, and 12,000 leaders of yin evil.

**Middle Earthly August One**
The Earthly August Lord has a human face and a serpent’s body, with eleven heads. He emerged to govern on the fifth day of the seventh month in the first year of *Taishi*. His surname is *Yue*, given name *Keng*, styled *Ziyuan*. He commands an army of 100,900,000 from the Five Peaks, governing the spirits of the eight wilds, four poles, three rivers, four seas, mountains, streams, valleys, dragons, snakes, turtles, giant turtles, thunder turtles, and ancient demons that afflict humans.

**Middle Human August One**
The Human August Lord has a human face and a dragon’s body, with nine heads. He emerged to govern on the third day of the first month in the first year of *Taiping*. His surname is *Kai*, given name *Hutao*, styled *Wensheng*. He commands an army of 100,900,000 from the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, governing all seven generations of parents, three great-grandparents, five ancestors, three ghosts, five spirits, internal and external male and female spirits of those who died by injury, clients who perished away from home, drowned, died in childbirth, were killed by fierce birds or beasts, wood or stone, or by execution or weapons, and who afflict humans.

The Middle Three August Ones are the transformations of the Primordial Dark Origin. When scholars purify themselves through fasting, transmit the Dao, and perform rituals to relieve suffering and dispel disasters, they may meditate and invoke these August Lords, commanding their legions. Together with the Great General of the Central Heaven (one), the Three-Five Great Generals (three), and their respective armies of one million each, they unite as one, combining their strength and resolve. Leading the officers and soldiers within the practitioner’s own body, each governing their respective domains, they manifest divine qi and spread their awe-inspiring might. They assist the practitioner in subduing rebellious ghosts, wicked officials, and malevolent persons, executing them all. Upholding the prohibitions, they purge the residual qi of the Six Heavens, forcing all demonic spirits into submission. Thus, spirits are commanded, ghosts are employed, and responses manifest as the heart desires. The afflicted are cured, the summoned arrive, the sought is obtained, the petitions are answered, and achievements are realized, serving as proof of efficacy.

**Later Heaven August One**
The Heaven August Lord has a human face and a serpent’s body. His surname is *Feng*, given name *Paoxi*, and he is styled *Taihao*.

**Later Earth August One**
The Earth August Lord has a human face and a serpent’s body. Her surname is *Yun*, given name *Nüwa*, and she is styled *Nühuang*.

**Later Human August One**
The Human August Lord has an ox’s face and a human’s body. His surname is *Jiang*, given name *Shennong*, and he is styled *Yandi*.

The Later Three August Ones are the three qi of the Primordial Dark Origin, transformed into the Three Origins, which take different forms yet return to the same source. Scholars who establish merit emulate the Three Origins. Benevolence, propriety, trust, righteousness, and wisdom are the Five Penetrations. When these five virtues are mastered, the Three and Five qi harmonize, the Eight Directions are traversed, and the Six Connections are achieved, one becomes a perfected sage.

The Nine August Lords share a single divine essence, yet their manifestations differ. From the First to the Middle, their ranks and stages vary, but at the highest attainment, they return to unity. The First August Ones govern without speech, the Middle August Ones teach through subtle words, and the Later August Ones rule by knotted cords. Scholars who discern the Nine August Ones must first study the Later Three, then master the art of knotted cords, progress to subtle words, and finally attain wordlessness, merging with the Dao.

**Talisman for Summoning the Perfected and Descending the Spirits**
**Talisman for Summoning the Perfected of the Heaven August Lord**

**Talisman for Summoning the Perfected of the Earth August Lord**
**Talisman for Summoning the Perfected of the Human August Lord**

These three talismans are to be inscribed on thin paper, one inch in width and three inches in length, with cinnabar ink facing the direction of the respective August Lord. Use them on a day of fullness during the *wang* or *xiang* hour, when ascending the altar, and ingest them with water. The perfected spirits and divine officials will then descend to you, first appearing dimly, and with time, their forms will become distinct.

After completing the ritual, before paying homage, ingest this talisman. If you later wish to consume it again, face the respective direction and swallow it in sequence. Alternatively, you may face east and ingest it with water. One talisman for the First August Lord, two for the Second, and three for the Third, totaling six talismans.

For those unable to ingest the talismans, inscribe them on a five-inch square of white silk, bordered in red and written in green. After purifying through fasting, on a *wang* or *xiang* day, invoke the August Lord, then roll the talisman into a crimson pouch and wear it over the heart. You will neither hunger from lack of food nor suffer illness from satiety. Over time, as you meditate upon the August Lord, divine *qi* will descend into the talisman, and the perfected spirits will attach to your person, ultimately transforming you into an immortal.

**Talisman for Ascending to Heaven**
This talisman is to be inscribed on a three-inch square of white bamboo paper, with blue-green ink facing the *wang* direction. After completing the transmission of the Dao and fulfilling your practices, when joyfully ascending to heaven, first ingest this talisman, and you will then take flight.

This talisman was passed down on the day of ascension when Wei Shuqing transmitted it to Li Shaojun. For all who study the Dao and cultivate perfection, if their merits and practices are incomplete and they cannot communicate with spirits or perceive fortune and misfortune, they must bathe and purify themselves, dwell in seclusion, burn incense, recite scriptures, study diagrams, refine their precepts, and reflect upon body and mind, correcting past transgressions and reforming evil. Those of like mind should independently cultivate goodness, and if they share the same aspirations, they should encourage one another, restraining themselves to aid others, upholding their roots, and venerating their origins. They should rely on the Three Honored Ones, praying for the fulfillment of their merits.

To test the efficacy of the method, when applying the August Writings, transmitting teachings, invoking the perfected, or summoning spirits, first calm the mind, purify through fasting, ingest the talisman, and lie down in quietude to seek dreams. Discern auspicious and inauspicious signs. When ascending the altar or entering the chamber, if in doubt, do not proceed. Maintain utmost purity, and over time, verification will come. Do not act hastily or forcefully in uncertainty, lest the interaction between human and spirit lead to misfortune without cause. Examine carefully and remember well; do not fail these words.

**Essential Instructions of the Western City: Celestial Writings of the Three August Ones (Large Script)**
Recorded by Master Bo in the first year of Tianhan, on the third day of the first month, as transmitted by the Immortal of the Western City.

The Immortal of the Western City, Lord Wang, said: "When heaven and earth unite in virtue, they endure together. Within them resides the wondrous essence of yin and yang. Yang spreads outward, and all things flourish; yin converges inward, and spirits attain subtlety. Through this flourishing, the myriad beings are stirred; through this subtlety, all things are preserved. If one obtains the method, demonic spirits may be commanded; if one grasps the profound technique, gods and deities will promptly arrive. Without precision and caution, harm will instead result."

Master Bo said: "In the second year of Taichu of the Former Han, Lord Wang clearly transmitted to me the essential instructions of the Great Dao, instructing me to burn incense and fast for three days and nights before revealing them."

The Immortal said: "The nameless name is the abode of my self. The named name is the treasure of my self. The unacting action is the virtue of my self. The possessing possession is the thief of my self. No sin is greater than lust, no misfortune greater than greed, no fault greater than slander. These three are the chariots of calamity. In minor cases, they endanger the self; in major cases, they destroy the family."

The Immortal said: "In youth, one does not study the true Dao; in old age, the heart becomes restless. Only when ill does one seek medicine; only when facing death does one seek life. It is like digging a well when thirsty or plowing when hungry—both are too late and will surely lead to darkness."

The Immortal said: "For those who wish to study the Dao, cultivate perfection, and prolong life to attain immortality, the following prohibitions must be observed:
- Do not expend essence, lest life be cut short.
- Do not overeat, lest the *qi* and vessels become obstructed.
- Do not overdrink, lest the bladder become strained.
- Do not overheat, lest the marrow and bones dissipate.
- Do not overchill, lest the muscles and flesh be harmed.
- Do not eat cold food, lest illness take root.
- Do not lose bodily fluids through spitting or sniveling.
- Do not gaze for long, lest the eyes become dim.
- Do not listen for long, lest hearing become dull.
- Do not weep for long, lest the spirit become sorrowful.
- Do not shout suddenly, lest the soul be startled.
- Do not harbor inner thoughts, lest the mind become distracted.
- Do not harbor anger, lest the spirit become displeased."

The Immortal said: "People only know that food can relieve hunger, but do not know that studying the Dao can relieve death. People only know that drink can quench thirst, but do not know that cultivating the Dao can preserve life. People only know that flattery is pleasing, but do not know that preserving the spirit can prolong life. People only know that good medicine can cure illness, but do not know that consuming the right substances can strengthen the self. People only know that night can conceal the body, but do not know the techniques for hiding one’s form. People only know how to avoid danger in secluded places, but are unwilling to practice the methods of transformation. People only know how to pray for heavenly fate, but do not know that preserving the self ensures survival. When the Dao is profound, one knows the methods; when cultivation is perfected, life is extended."

The Immortal said: "The herb of Great Yin is called *gouwen*; if ingested, it causes instant death. The herb of Great Yang is called *huangjing*; if ingested, it can prolong life. Yet the common people believe in the lethality of *gouwen* but not in the life-prolonging benefits of *huangjing*. They only fear the poison of *gouwen* but do not know that *huangjing* extends life. They only know how to fear death but do not know how to seek life. These are the people drowned in the Six Defilements, the followers of the Five Turbidities. Only if you can turn your heart toward matters beyond this world can you begin to speak of seeking life."

The Immortal then taught the method of the Minor Elixir, using realgar, cypress seeds, and techniques for restraining the hun and po souls, as follows:
Pound cypress seeds a thousand times, sift finely, and remove the dregs. Mix with ten pounds of pine resin. Add one pound of realgar, as red as a plum, to the medicine, and pound again according to the method.

Steam the medicine for a full day until it becomes as pliable as malt sugar. Sit upright facing north and take five pills at dawn; after a hundred days, you will commune with the spirits.

Another method for the Minor Elixir:
Use mercury, cinnabar, and realgar—three substances in equal parts, refined separately. Mix with white honey and form into pills the size of soybeans. On a clear morning at daybreak, face east and take seven pills, rinsing with flower-infused water. Take them twice daily; after three years of continuous use, your body will emit light, and prolonged consumption may confer immortality.

The Method for Restraining the Hun Soul:
To restrain the *hun* and *po* souls, the Three Ones must be divided among the *Niwan* (Mud Pill Palace), *Jianggong* (Crimson Palace), and *Dantian* (Cinnabar Field). These three are the numinous repositories of the body. At night, while lying down, visualize a mirror one foot in diameter floating five inches before your face, moving among the three palaces. In the morning, visualize the moon in the same manner as the sun. This practice strengthens the heart and rectifies the spirit, ensuring the *hun* and *po* do not stray, making malevolent spirits fear you and enabling you to command a hundred ghosts.

The Immortal said: "After receiving this method, I immediately prostrated myself and could not rise."
The Master replied: "The method is too shallow to fully subdue the spirits."

I then bowed deeply and said to the Immortal:
"From my youth, though unworthy, I have been bound by世俗 affairs. Only now, after ten years of wandering in search of the Way and vainly pondering its principles, have I glimpsed the subtlety of the sacred method and the proof of immortality. Birds and beasts grieve in lofty chambers, finding solace in secluded dwellings—this is what brings humans peace. Deep rivers and layered abysses suit fish and turtles, but humans abhor them. In matters of the self, only the Dao is intimate. Having received the profound instructions for cultivating the body, I should uphold and practice them, dwelling with them as with my own form. Yet my thoughts still wander, and my heart is not fully committed.

Once, I heard of techniques to command ghosts and spirits, methods to summon a hundred spirits. At rest, malevolent forces would gather instantly; with a gesture, a thousand deities would harmonize. Without inquiry, one could perceive the unseen, and at a word, dispel misfortune. Though I have heard of such methods, I have never seen their texts. Yet heaven and earth have their constancy, and the Dao does not teach them. Just as Bian Que did not discard his needles because a patient died, I humbly beg for enlightenment to open my heart."

The Master then instructed me to sit again and said: "You are not yet ready to be taught the Great Dao. In three years, I will tell you."
I withdrew, returned to my seat, and served him with towels and combs for three full years. Before I could speak, the Master said: "You are now ready. Prepare with three days of fasting, burn incense, bathe, and I will teach you the essential Dao: the Heavenly Writings of the Three Sovereigns in large script, and the method of the Golden Elixir from the *Taiqing Zhongjing*. If you reveal these to the unworthy, your clan will be exterminated, and the ghosts of your parents will suffer punishment in the Dark Mound."

I bowed and said: "In the past, Bian He endured the amputation of his feet rather than abandon the uncut jade—such is the certainty of recognizing truth. Now, with this single instruction, you grant me the wish for rebirth. I will guard it without divulgence."

The Immortal said: "The *Huangwen* (August Writings) date from before the Three Sovereigns, from the time of the great script of bird tracks. When the Three Sovereigns established their rule, heaven harmonized and earth stilled; they ordered yin and yang, regulated ghosts and spirits, subdued the myriad essences, and lived as long as their bodies. This is what the Queen Mother of the West treasures, what the immortals of the celestial bureaus revere—it is the true treasure of scriptures. Few in the world possess it. Those who do, such as the Nine Elder Immortals of the Tai Xuan Immortal Capital, always dispatch a direct talisman to guard this true script. Those who transcribe it carelessly will err—how can one not be cautious?

Those who possess it must proceed as if blind, rectifying their hearts day and night, revering this scripture. Then they may enjoy its full benefits: the five weapons, the five poisons, and calamitous ghosts will not dare to gaze upon them. How could one speak of its power when applied?

Now, I will outline the prohibitions, taboos, and regulations, as well as the celestial officials’ methods for recording and punishing transgressions, as follows. Study them diligently and be warned:

To transmit the scriptures to the unworthy, or to speak of them or the celestial patterns, incurs the crime of possessing celestial patterns, punishable by the extermination of one’s clan. The ghosts of one’s parents will be punished in the Great Dark Capital.

Before transmitting the scriptures, fast for three days; before receiving them, fast for three days. Burn incense, bathe, and perform rites before using them. Failure to do so will cause sores to erupt on the body and face.

After transmitting the scriptures, if there is no mutual affection, or after receiving them, if there is no mutual intimacy, ghosts and spirits will be summoned without restraint, and the myriad essences will be flogged endlessly. The Nine Heavens’ Venerable One will disrupt one’s heart and mind, causing bloodshed in the limbs and the ruin of one’s aspirations.

After receiving the scriptures, on the night of the *jiazi* day, face west and visualize the three scrolls of the Three Sovereigns’ Writings, each placed a foot apart. Then rise, face west, and bow three times to the large script. Visualize the east and bow once.

Do not lend your clothing to others; violating this will cause spirits to abandon your body, and your pursuit of the Dao will yield no response. Such are the regulations of cultivating the Dao. Those who uphold them will flourish; those who oppose them will surely perish."

After receiving these instructions, the Master produced from his robe a ready-made text, as follows:

**Highest Name**: Fast for five days in quietude. Write the talisman in cinnabar on five inches of silk and place it in a purified chamber. Summon the lofty scholar Tai He, who will appear within the time it takes to eat a meal.

**Heavenly Sovereign Name**: Summon the Controller of Destinies. Write in blue on a foot of silk, fast for seven days, and place it in the proper location. Within the time it takes to eat a meal, the Controller of Destinies will appear. You may inquire about fortune or misfortune but must not detain them long.

**High Heaven Name**: Summon the Recorder, following the same method as for the Controller of Destinies. Women who wear this talisman will close their hearts to lustful thoughts.

**Supreme Name**: Summon the Controller of Yin, also following the method for the Controller of Destinies. Carry this talisman to repel weapons.

**August Heaven Name**: Summon the Controller of Perils. Fast for three days, write in red on blue silk, and place it in a purified chamber. The Controller of Perils will arrive instantly; you may inquire about fortune or misfortune.

**Azure Heaven Name**: Summon the Celestial Deities. Fast for five days, write in cinnabar on five inches of white silk, and place it in the chamber.

**High Sovereign Name**: Summon the River Earl, following the method for summoning mountain spirits.

Place it in water, and the River Earl will arrive instantly; you may inquire about floods or droughts.

**Supreme Lord Name**: Summon the Grand Chancellor. Fast for thirty days, write in cinnabar on yellow silk, and place it in the chamber. He will arrive instantly; you may inquire about the suitability of your conduct or fortune and misfortune.

**Heavenly Emperor Name**: Summon the Nine Heavens’ Parents. Fast as for the Chancellor, and inquire about your future generations or make requests. Carry this talisman, and you will come to no harm.

Fast for four days, write in cinnabar on paper, and summon the Six Dings in the chamber.

Fast for four days to summon the Sun and Moon Generals in the residence.

From the **Highest Name** to the **Heavenly Emperor Name**, there are nine ranks in total. The annotations below detail the methods of summoning and application, which differ from those in the *Bao Gong’s Internal Classic and Regulations*.

Should one follow the methods of Lord Wang, one must adhere to the nine ranks as annotated. The method of inscribing talismans requires that brush, ink, and inkstone not be shared with others. All must be done while burning incense and maintaining a pure fast, in a secluded place. Upon completing the fast, at night within a clean and purified chamber, don one’s immortal robes according to the lunar station and summon the spirits while wearing them. When summoning celestial deities, the talisman’s characters must face upward. When summoning the spirits of the Five Peaks, the Three Rivers, the Yangtze and the seas, or the hundred earthly domains, the characters must face downward. Stand in wait for a moment, and one may then behold the arrival of the summoned. The deities of Heaven and Earth, along with the essences of mountains and rivers, may appear in human form, or with the heads of birds or beasts upon human bodies, or with the bodies of birds, beasts, dragons, or serpents and human heads. They may be tall or short, fragrant or foul, of alluring beauty or fearsome ugliness. One must maintain a composed demeanor and steady posture, without fear or hesitation, and then proceed to inquire of them according to the matter at hand, whereupon they will respond immediately. However, when celestial deities arrive, they must not be detained long; one should promptly dismiss them, for to ask questions beyond their proper domain is to invite death. All talismans are inscribed in cinnabar, with a width of one chi and two cun, and the same measure in length. While writing, one must not pause to speak.

If one's own talismans are coarse, use the five colors, with the same measurements for width and length as prescribed. If no annotations specify the color, length, or width of the silk, follow the same dimensions as the cinnabar talismans—one chi and two cun in both width and length—and place them within the chamber. Should the chamber or household encounter death, impurity, or filth; if one treads near a woman in childbirth or where livestock has given birth, all becomes disordered. Even with diligent fasting and purification, the celestial spirits will not descend.

*Secret Sayings of Master Baopu*
Master Baopu said: I have heard that in this age of the Five Turbidities, the true source cannot be established—like clear water flowing through a river of muddied waves, unable to preserve its mirror-like clarity. According to the celestial texts one summons, the body remains within the household, and no household can go ten days without encountering impurity. In such cases, failure is assured. If one wishes to perform the rites in the mountains, one must dwell alone, avoiding all human contact, maintaining strict fasting and awaiting the spirits—success will then come as easily as turning one’s palm.

In the fourth month of the first year of Xianhe, on the day *wuwu*, I kept nearly twenty oxen to the west of my residence. The times were marked by famine, my household’s fortunes had declined, and the county suffered from rampant tiger attacks, impossible to prevent. The tigers had already claimed six or seven oxen over a hundred days. I then moved to a separate dwelling, observed a ten-day fast, and according to the method, summoned the Lord of the Lofty Mountain to halt the tiger’s ravages. That night, I performed the rites, and after some time, a figure appeared—clad in a plain yellow robe, wearing a *jinxian* cap, upon which perched a red bird. His stature was that of an average man, his fingers nearly a foot long, and his bearing majestic. He identified himself as the Earth Master of the Lofty Mountain. I instructed him to end the tiger’s harm, and he assented. When the tiger next took an ox, this lord first shot it with a pellet, striking its thigh; the arrow snapped at once, lodging in the flesh. Later, a dead tiger was found in the bamboo grove, its thigh shattered, and the pellet and arrowhead were recovered—confirming the truth of the matter. Thereafter, the tiger’s rampage ceased within a mile.

Initially, this text only allowed for summoning the Lord of the Lofty Mountain. Later, I summoned the Earth Duke, the Lord of the Soil, and lesser spirits, as well as minor deities of rivers and streams—all arrived as commanded. However, my sincerity was weak, my mind not wholly focused, so I dared not trust myself to summon the Celestial August Ancestor, the Ten Generals of the Five Peaks, or the Nine Immortals of the Three Heavens, fearing improper order might bring disaster.

The *Three August Scripts* and the *Great Characters* were compiled by the immortal Wang Jun, excerpted and arranged into a single scroll for practical use. I once heard Bao of Nanhai say that the *Three August Celestial Scripts* and *Great Characters* contained forty thousand words. What I have seen seems incomplete. Bao claimed these were the *Group Scripts of the Three Heavens and Eight Assemblies*, to be selected and compiled as needed. This compilation is thus not exhaustive. Bao said: "To fully expound the Dao of Heaven is to stand alongside the Perfected; one’s essence must return to its origin." For all summonings and applications, one must proceed with care to secure blessings—how could it be taken lightly? According to the statutes, disrespect invites punishment; how much worse is it to summon spirits without proper grounding?

Bao did not dismiss my humble abilities and imparted to me the essential methods of the three texts. Yet my talent remains that of the common stream, and I have not plumbed the depths of the spirits and ghosts. Changfang, Heran, Tanchang, Tuosheng, Fangzhan, and Zhao Zhun all commanded ghosts and spirits, striking down the myriad numina. Yet these men, grown arrogant through their arts and failing to rectify themselves, all met untimely ends—how tragic!

Even in human relations, one must remain humble and self-disciplined, yet some still incur punishment. How much more so for those who preside over ghosts and spirits? One’s heart and form must not deviate even by a hair’s breadth; only then can half the battle be won—how could one indulge their base nature?

I once heard that Master Li was the patriarch of the Daoist scriptures. Master Li himself said: In the past, on Yingzhou, I visited Dong Zhongjun. Zhongjun possessed the *Great Existence Scripture of the Nine Heavens* in four scrolls, and the *Lesser Existence Scripture* in four scrolls. The characters were two *cun* square, sparse and elegant, each scroll as thick as a five-*cun* bamboo. The table of contents claimed a hundred thousand words. I suspected the text was brief but the characters numerous. Zhongjun said: "This is not a scripture of this world, but the *Great Chapters of the Three Heavens and Eight Assemblies*. One character contains thirty-three characters, arranged in all directions according to their form and use." He pointed to several characters from the *Great Existence* and transmitted them to me—truly the arcane canon of the highest heavens. Compared to the *Three August Inner Scripts* and the *Celestial Great Characters*, how could four scrolls contain only forty thousand words?

Moreover, Master Bao’s *Explanations of the Nodes* states that the *Three August Great Characters* excerpt the texts of the *Great* and *Lesser Existence*, merely assigning them different names. This makes the matter even clearer. On fasting days, one should place the *Three August Great Characters* to one’s left and right, maintaining a steadfast mind and revering their numinous forms. It is also fitting to keep the *Six Jia Direct Talismans* nearby—for today, the *Jiazi* talisman is presided over by Wang Wenqing.

*The Wondrous Essence Scripture of the Eight Perfected Emperors of the Cavernous Spirit* concludes.
