**The Supreme Highest Scripture on Inner Alchemy’s Guarding the One and True Stabilization**
Transmitted by the Celestial Mother of Qihua Purple Radiance from the Seven Golden Treasure Mountain of Nanyue

I have heard that the Great Dao, at the inception of primordial chaos, divided and established Heaven and Earth. The sun and moon wove their warp and weft, intermingling the primordial qi, the essence of yin and yang. The Dao’s methods give rise to life and preserve destiny, nurturing form. Yet worldly people, benighted and deluded, indulge in desires and cut short their lives. Now, this sacred teaching is transmitted—all initiates must revere and practice it.

The Primordial Beginning Supreme Thearch addressed the newly enlightened assembly of perfected beings, saying: "I possess a wondrous Dao, long concealed and unspoken. Movement in duality constitutes yin; stillness in unity constitutes yang. Duality entails transformation; unity abides in constancy. To know constancy is to awaken to clarity; to embrace the One is to preserve numinous spirit. If you wish for longevity, you must ingest the golden essence. Stabilize the spirit, guide the qi, and let true breathing flow ceaselessly. Abide in this ceaseless continuity, and you shall attain the mystery within the mystery.

"From the Central Elixir Field, fire flows upward; the yin spirit ascends to meet it. Kan (Water) and Li (Fire) intermingle and solidify, and transformation arises naturally. Only stabilization is the root—this is called the numinous foundation. Radiant and resplendent, it illumines Heaven and Earth of its own accord. With verdant intestines and cinnabar marrow, you shall endure for ten thousand generations. When yin departs and yang is purified, you shall ascend in broad daylight."

Thereupon, the Jade Clarity Great Dao Lord declared: "This is the treasure of the body, the mother of the ten thousand qi. When the initiate attains this mother, the six offspring are born. You must meditate deeply upon its meaning, guard its true stabilization, and naturally attain the wondrous union of form and spirit. You shall become one with the Dao, a companion to Heaven—nothing is greater than this."

At that time, the newly enlightened perfected beings, having heard this wondrous Dao, withdrew to secluded chambers. They concentrated their thoughts in stillness, returning to the primordial beginning, and attained the perfect Dao.
