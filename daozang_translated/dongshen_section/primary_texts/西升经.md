**Laozi’s Scripture of Western Ascension [Imperial Commentary]**

**Scripture Title:** *Laozi’s Scripture of Western Ascension* (Imperial Commentary by Emperor Huizong of Song). Originally titled *Scripture of Western Ascension*. The text likely emerged between the Wei and Jin dynasties, attributed to Laozi’s instruction of Guanling Yin Xi. Emperor Huizong’s commentary was composed during the Zhenghe era of the Northern Song. Three fascicles. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Dongshen Section, Benwen Category. Collated with Chen Jingyuan’s *Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension*.

**Preface to the Scripture of Western Ascension**
That through which all things arise is called the Dao; the Dao within me is called virtue. Dao and virtue are innate to humanity, yet the deluded often lose them. As the Zhou declined, the people long wandered in confusion, and the world’s Way was lost. Then appeared a vast and true person, who regarded essence as refined and things as coarse. He composed two chapters expounding the meaning of Dao and virtue to awaken the world. Later scholars, beholding the purity of heaven and earth and the greatness of the ancients, attributed this to the power of the Primordial Sovereign. The sage’s love for humanity never ceases, yet fearing his teachings might not fully convey the subtleties, he further discoursed on the essentials of the Dao to Guanling Yin Xi, arranging them into thirty-nine chapters titled *Scripture of Western Ascension*. Its words are urgent and earnest, its exhortations repeated, taking attainment of the One as the supreme subtlety and ascension as secondary. Its intent is to guide later generations directly toward the wondrous root, the realm of carefree self-attainment. Herein lies the merit of perfect salvation.

In the intervals of my myriad duties, I wander in spirit through the Great Clarity, ever attentive to the purport of Dao and virtue. Having already provided glosses for the two chapters, I could not leave this scripture unaddressed. Thus, I have sought its meaning and ventured a commentary.

Master Hao Jun once said: “None delves deeper into the Dao than the *Five Thousand Characters*; the rest are but a waste of paper and ink.” This scripture, however, serves as its outer and inner counterpart, demanding my utmost devotion.

**Imperially Composed Preface of the Zhenghe Era**

**Scripture of Western Ascension, Fascicle One**

**Chapter One: Western Ascension**
The Venerable Lord ascended westward, revealing the Dao in Jambudvīpa. The Dao is nowhere absent—even among the barbarian tribes of distant lands, what place does not proceed from this Dao? Only the sage, awakening first, can awaken those who follow. Thus, though Jambudvīpa is a remote frontier, he still saves it without abandonment. Confucius once wished to dwell among the Nine Yi, sharing this intent.

**Titled "Ancient Master"**
The sage has no fixed name; he manifests titles in response to the times. During Fuxi’s reign, he was called Master Yuhua; in Shennong’s time, Master Dacheng; under the Yellow Emperor, Master Guangcheng. From the Tang, Yu, and Zhou dynasties onward, he served as the emperor’s teacher in each era. Though his names and titles varied, he appeared in every age. Thus, when he entered the Flowing Sands in the west, he was called the Ancient Master. The word "ancient" signifies trust in the wondrous antiquity, holding fast to the ancient Dao to govern the present. One variant reads "possesses the ancient," which is incorrect.

**Skilled in Entering Non-Action**
Neither ending nor beginning, eternally abiding and unbroken. The Dao constantly practices non-action yet lacks nothing in action. The sage embodies the Dao—what does he do? "I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves." Demonstrating non-action is the essence of the Dao. The Dao’s essence is undifferentiated and complete, without trace of action. Approaching it, one sees no head—who can trace its origin? Following it, one sees no tail—who can grasp its end? Thus, it has existed since antiquity, enduring through ten thousand generations without cease.

The term "unbroken" signifies ceaseless continuity. Thus, ascending to join the Dao, one traverses the passes. When Pass Guardian Yin Xi beheld the qi, he purified himself in fasting to receive the guest. He expounded the Dao and its virtue, arranging them into two scrolls.

The sage’s arrival is always accompanied by auspicious signs. Thus, when the Ancestor bound his hair and journeyed west, the Dao passed through Hangu Pass. By observing the qi, Yin Xi was able to perceive him. Only with reverent courtesy could one be deemed fit to discuss the Dao’s principles. Without an empty mind and single-minded devotion, the Dao would not be transmitted. Yin Xi first prepared with fasting and purification, then received the guest with utmost reverence and ritual propriety. Thereupon, the Primordial One composed the two-scroll work, expounding the meaning of Dao and virtue in over five thousand words, and further imparted the essentials of the Dao.

He revealed the Dao’s essentials, saying: "The Dao is self-so." The practitioner may attain it; the listener may speak of it. The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know. Speech exists to convey sound, and thus discourse relies on words to express resonance. The essentials are not prolix—one word suffices: "self-so." As the *Dao Jing* states: "The Dao models itself on the self-so." The self-so Dao values practice above all; without practice, one cannot reach it. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing it is not as good as practicing it. Hearing merely enables speech, for what can be discussed in words is but the coarse aspect of things. The Dao admits no questions; questions elicit no answers. Thus, not-knowing is knowing, and knowing is not-knowing. When Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, he received four instances of not-knowing. Though the Dao cannot be transmitted through words, it is not to be sought in sounds, yet one cannot depart from sounds to attain it. The sage speaks only when compelled, for things inherently possess their own resonance. Without words, there would be no means of manifestation. Yet if one seeks principle through words, each will cling to their own "so." One variant reads "taught the essentials to his son," which is incorrect.

Those who do not understand the Dao burden themselves with words. Without hearing or speaking, they know not whence things arise. Gongsun Long’s sophistry filled myriad words; Hui Shi’s writings filled five carts. Yet the more they spoke, the more they exhausted themselves, drifting ever farther from the Dao. There is no other reason: they did not hear the Dao of lifelong silence, nor did they know the constant principles of the world. One variant reads "did not ask," which is incorrect.

It is like one who knows music: recognizing tones through strings. The mind knows the sound, but the mouth cannot convey it. The Dao is profound and subtle; the knower does not speak. Ziqi was skilled in listening, his intent fixed on lofty mountains and flowing waters. Again, he attained it from Shi Wen’s zither playing, yet if the heart did not grasp it, he dared not move his hands to pluck the strings. Thus, the connoisseur of music cannot express it in words, though a pattern exists within. The essence of the supreme Dao is subtly wondrous and profoundly penetrating, too deep to be fathomed. How could it be the coarse matter of sounds? To silently comprehend it suffices—what need is there for endless chatter?

One who recognizes the sorrow in sound inwardly reflects. The heart commands the mouth to speak, yet the speaker does not know. The sounds of music—joy, ease, sorrow, resentment—arise differently. The discerning musician externally suppresses the sound while inwardly contemplating its principle. Only then can one grasp the subtlety of sound, understanding why it is sorrowful or joyful. What need is there for words?

Alas! The Dao is profoundly subtle; sounds cannot encompass it, nor can those who lack understanding fathom it. How could it be confined to mere voices? Speech is the voice of the heart; what the mouth utters, the heart commands. When the heart merges with the Dao, it is serene and constantly still. Though one may wish to speak, it cannot be done. Even a single utterance distances one from the Dao.

**Chapter Two: The Dao’s Profundity**
Laozi said: The Dao is profoundly abstruse, the abyss of emptiness and nothingness. The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, its depths unfathomable. It is called "profound" and "abstruse" to show that the essence of the supreme Dao is depth upon depth, beyond all measurement.

Only because it is deep can it be utterly empty, sufficient to embrace all fullness; utterly non-existent, sufficient to encompass all existence. Its depths are unfathomable—how could words ever discuss it? As the *Dao Jing* states: "Abyssal! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things."

Though you may hear the Dao, your heart does not refine into cinnabar. Why is this? Words in books cannot exhaust its meaning. The Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is not to hear it. The essence of the supreme Dao cannot be grasped by the learner’s ear, nor transmitted by the teacher’s words. Even if one strives to hear the Dao, it reaches only the ear—how can one penetrate its subtleties and fully unite with it in the heart?

What the world values in the Dao are books. Books are but words, and what words value is meaning. Without forgetting words to grasp meaning, no attainment is possible. One variant reads "heard and explained," which is incorrect.

The written expressions in scriptures are learned to achieve resonance. You should treasure them, inwardly reflecting and pondering. The self-so Dao does not await your expectation.

Overjoyed, Yin Xi bowed twice and asked: "How should one pursue learning?"

The sage writes books and establishes teachings not out of love for debate, but to illuminate the Dao’s wonders for later learners, that each may examine their own understanding. If you truly treasure and cherish them, contemplating and penetrating their meaning, you may suddenly transcend and awaken, your spirit unified in an instant. The Dao will then reside within you—what need is there for expectations of near or far?

**Chapter Three: Skillful Exposition**
Laozi said: One who skillfully composes writings must refine their language. One who skillfully expounds affairs must master their words. Strive diligently, and you will attain the Dao.

The purpose of writing is to clarify the Dao. Only when the composition does not contradict principle can the Dao be illuminated thereby. Those who recite the writings seek to grasp the principle. Without mastering the words, how can the principle be revealed? Both depend on diligent effort. Diligence in study broadens knowledge and sharpens wisdom; diligence in practicing the Dao daily increases virtue and yields great achievement.

**The Virtue Classic** states: When a superior person hears the Dao, they diligently practice it. In rectifying without fixation, rectitude naturally returns to them. Unreceptive to the perverse, perverse qi departs of itself. This is called *wuwei*—the Dao spontaneously assists.

The Dao divides into two: rectitude and perversity, and nothing else. Rectitude and perversity do not intermingle, just as fragrance and stench cannot share the same vessel. Whether one is rectified or perverse depends solely on action or inaction, acceptance or rejection.

The Dao’s ultimate rectitude knows no bounds or limits; it is not confined by any fixed method. Should one cling rigidly to a single approach, failing to encompass all things, then rectitude reverts to strangeness, and perverse qi cannot be warded off—how could this be the Dao of *wuwei*?

The *Commentary* says: Only in *wuwei* does subtlety abide. If one does not flatter the spirits in sacrifice, ghosts will shun them of their own accord. In an age of utmost virtue, earth and heaven are sundered, and no divine descents occur. Thus, ghosts possess no numinous power, nor do they manifest marvelous responses—how could one seek blessings through excessive rites?

In later ages, sacrificial regulations knew no restraint. Those who worshipped spirits not their own abounded, and each sought to guard their own unseen realm, yet this could not be achieved. Confucius said: “I have prayed for a long time.” Without wearying the spirits, one receives destiny without fixed term.

One whose form is whole possesses a whole spirit; one whose spirit is whole embodies the Dao of the sage. Those who skillfully nurture life embrace their nature and hold fast to their spirit. Their minds are at ease and free of affairs, so the spirit guards the form, and the form attains longevity.

The *Commentary* says: If the spirit is overtaxed, it becomes exhausted; if the form is overtaxed, it becomes worn. When spirit and form are agitated, to desire longevity with heaven and earth is unheard of. (One version reads: *to desire long life*.)

Without advance or retreat, who would conspire with them? Emerging from the Dao without scheming, they neither emerge into yang nor withdraw into concealment, but stand towering at the center. That which brings about this state is not natural—yet is it not?

When joyful, they bow their heads, saying: “Now I have received your command.” Honor and disgrace arrive, each reflecting one’s virtue, without the slightest deviation. There is a resonance like echo and shadow—how could this be contrived or feigned by human effort? This is what Mencius meant by: “That which issues from you returns to you.”

**Chapter Four: Acting with Caution**
Laozi said: Act with caution and cherish it in your heart. I shall journey far, yet we will meet without expectation.

Knowing is not difficult; practicing is difficult. Thus, one must act with caution in practicing the Dao. The sage cherishes it, while the multitude debates it. To cherish it lies in treasuring and valuing it. If one can uphold this Dao, though dwelling with the sage, the distance between them may be as heaven and earth, yet how could they fail to meet as if side by side?

Yin Xi received these words with profound sincerity, and so at the Pass he claimed illness, abandoned his post, and dwelt alone in a quiet chamber. Go is but a minor art, yet without wholehearted devotion, one cannot master it—how much more so for those who advance in the Dao? Thus, it was fitting that he abandoned his post and dwelt alone.

For in abandoning one’s post, one is not entangled in affairs; in dwelling alone, one does not engage with things. Practicing the Dao in this way is truly knowing what should come first.

In tranquil reflection, one’s thoughts return to the Dao, and one’s will guards the One. The root of the ultimate is formless; its analysis is subtle and precise.

Thought gives rise to wisdom. Through thought, one attains it; without thought, one does not. Only by nurturing wisdom with tranquility and avoiding engagement with things can one transcend thought, and the Dao accumulate within the self.

Yet the essence lies in preserving the spirit and husbanding essence. For the will is the direction of the heart and the dwelling of the spirit; the One is the number of kidney-water and the repository of essence. In these two, if one can return and guard them, then by attaining emptiness one reaches the ultimate, and by entering nonbeing one guards the root. The Dao’s profound subtlety and wondrous mystery will then be effortlessly resolved.

The *Plain Questions* says: “Emptiness, tranquility, and the spirit guarded within”—this accords precisely with the above.

Contemplating subtle words, one’s inner intent does not stray. Reciting the text ten thousand times, one’s sincerity penetrates through reflection. Practicing the true and returning it to the self, one can fathom its mystery.

Discoursing on the origin of the limitless, one can attain immortality. Where there is a wondrous Dao, there are wondrous words. Wondrous words are circuitous yet hit the mark, subtle yet manifest. Only through profound inquiry, focusing the will without distraction, can one grasp their essential meaning.

Yet it begins with recitation, threading them together through repetition, and penetrating them through reflection. Thus, one can cultivate the self, and the true resides within. For “attaining the One” is called essence; “self-completion” is called sincerity. The true is the utmost of essence and sincerity.

In daily conduct, one does not depart from the true, and what one receives from heaven cannot be altered by things. The most wondrous under heaven will then be universally accessible. There is no other reason for this than knowing that the great origin of the Dao issues from the limitless. Not only does one embody it, but one can also discourse upon it. Thus, one enters the state of neither death nor life, enduring as long as heaven and earth. Ascending on wings and soaring away is but a secondary matter.

**Chapter Five: The Image of the Dao**
Laozi said: The image of the Dao has no form or end; in its vastness and indistinctness, it seems to vanish yet remains.

The *Book of Changes* says: “What is seen is called an image.” The Dao cannot be seen—how could its form or outline be exhausted? This is what the Classic means by “the great image is formless.”

“Vast” (*huang*) describes a presence of light without form, seeming to exist yet not existing. “Indistinct” (*hu*) describes a presence that is not yet formed, seeming not to exist yet not nonexistent. Flickering as if vanished yet present, it cannot be sought in terms of being or nonbeing. This is what the Classic means by “the image of no-thing.”

It is like a tree’s seed before it sprouts, when branches, leaves, and roots are not yet visible. When earth, water, fire, and wind converge, the qi of the four seasons flows in cycles.

Plants and trees have life but no awareness; their lack of awareness differs from that of humans, yet their possession of life is the same. Before they sprout, it is like the unmanifested state of a human embryo, the time of *taiyi*. Without visible branches, leaves, or roots, it is like the human form when qi, shape, and substance are present but not yet separated.

When the sprout emerges, it scatters into branches and leaves, spreading laterally into roots—just as humans gather the qi of the four elements, following the cycles of time to form their bodies.

Though life has come into being, what then is that which gives life to life? Thus it is said: the Dao’s image has no form or beginning, appearing indistinct yet abiding as if present. Qi is the ground of that which lives; when gathered and congealed, it gradually hardens.

Qi enters the body and is called life. Human life is the gathering of qi. At first, qi transforms and condenses; with time, form takes shape and solidifies. The movement of yin and yang follows this principle as a matter of course. Flavors differ, and their effects are not equal—sweet, bitter, pungent, salty, sour. The Dao divides into yin and yang, scatters into the Five Phases, and branches into the five flavors. The reason the five flavors differ is that the Five Phases are not equal. Moisture descending produces saltiness; flame rising produces bitterness; wood’s bending and straightening produces sourness; metal’s malleability produces pungency; sowing and reaping produce sweetness—such is the reason for the difference in flavors. Fire blazes, water moistens, wood bends, metal hardens, earth evens and spreads, and from it comes sowing and reaping—such is the inequality of the Five Phases. Flavors are the Five Phases, yet that which flavors all flavors is the Dao.

Qi moves in varying degrees, its strength and weakness decidedly unequal. Though issuing from the same source, it takes on different names and forms, each with its own cause for vitality. Throughout the world, qi is one; the myriad things transform and sprout in their separate domains. There are states of flourishing and decline, flows of change and transformation. The amount of qi received varies by capacity, so the strength or weakness of things depends on what they are endowed with—like the great clod. Alas! Qi blows through the myriad apertures, roaring in countless ways, yet each sound arises of itself. Though the sounds differ, they all issue from the wind; though the forms differ, they all issue from the Dao. From this arise different natures and behaviors, and thus the reception of bodily forms.

Nurturing the Dao of yin and yang, they incline toward what they rely upon as kin. The Way of life is not of one kind; all beings—human and non-human alike—differ in their natures, some firm, some yielding, some slow, some swift. Thus their forms vary—feathered, furred, scaled, shelled. Those endowed more with yang are rooted in Heaven and incline upward; those endowed more with yin are rooted in Earth and incline downward. Though their groupings and divisions differ in disposition, though their forms vary—flying, walking, moving, still—from the sentient to the insentient, from the formed to the formless, their paths may differ, but their return is the same. Their thoughts may be many, but their attainment is one. All emerge from emptiness and nothingness, stirred into the arising of spirit.

It is like producing sound: the hand moves, the string is plucked. Gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu—each note is breathed forth from the origin. All that is substantial in the world arises from the insubstantial; all that exists in the world emerges from nothingness. The Dao is emptiness and nothingness. The Dao gives birth to the One; the One is the world’s utmost essence. The One gives birth to the Two; the Two is that to which spirit responds. Heaven and Earth intermingle in misty union, and the myriad things rely on spirit to live. Yet spirit is born of the Dao—just as metal and stone have sound, which does not ring unless struck. When the hand moves and the string is plucked, the gong note stirs the gong, the jue note stirs the jue, and the five tones become manifest.

Body, speech, and mind are the root; the Dao emerges from the supreme origin. The root lies in emptiness and stillness—thus it is said the Dao is self-so. The five tones, once set in motion, become entangled with music and sensual pleasures. Bound within the realm of the living, the hundred bones, nine orifices, five viscera, and six bowels all reside within the body. These three—body, speech, and mind—are the root of life. Yet what governs the body’s encompassing of the hundred bones, its breathing and silence, its speech and stillness? What determines the mind’s good and evil, right and wrong? The Dao is their root alone.

That which is above form is called the Dao; all things turn their heads toward it. The Dao’s essence is utterly empty, yet nothing can obstruct it; utterly still, yet nothing can disturb it. It is pure even in defilement, and nothing precedes it. How could it be forced or contrived to be so? Having drifted far from the Dao, one sinks into human artifice. The five colors blind the eyes; the five sounds deafen the ears. One is swept along with things, unable to free oneself—this is not the truth of self-so. In discussing movement and agitation, one speaks of sound rather than color; in discussing entanglement, one speaks of color rather than sound—this is merely an alternating presentation.

Yang scatters to become light; qi spreads to form the six senses. From this arise life and death, and the Dao scatters and divides. Turning from root to branch, dispersing simplicity to dilute purity—this is the Dao’s transformation, showing it is not constant, desiring that all return to their true nature. The Dao divides into yin and yang; yin and yang are the greatest of qi. All things bear yin and embrace yang—all are the Dao’s distribution. Once form and substance are complete, the six senses contend and clash, and nothing can stop them. Thus, born from earth, one returns to earth; emerging from concealment, one enters concealment. Flowing through the realm of life and death, the myriad transformations never reach an end. There is no other reason: chasing the branch and forgetting the root, drifting ever farther from the Dao, scattering simplicity to make tools, drowning in dilution without returning to the source.

The Dao of true constancy has no past or present; it enters the realm of neither death nor life. Yet things undergo arising and ceasing—this cannot be considered constant, for it is the Dao’s transformation. As *Liezi* says: “Spirit departs from form, each returning to its true nature.”

**Chapter on the Way of Life**
The Old Master said: I tell you the root of the Way of life, showing you what is self-so. As for the arising of the myriad things, emotions and actions intertwine. Like breaking and reforming, like perishing and reviving, they complete the Five Phases, with yin and yang conjoined. Turning and transforming, they become the essence of things.

That which gives life to life is called *change*. What is born of life dies, yet that which gives life never ends—thus that which gives life is the Dao. The root of the Way of life—is it contrived by human effort or artificial means? It is self-so alone. As *Liezi* says: “Self-arising, self-transforming.” Though the myriad things are rooted in self-so, the emotions they express and the actions they take depend on what they receive and what they are given. Things become entangled and cannot free themselves; the Dao merely responds in accord. What is completed here is diminished there; what dies here is born there—like a ring without end, the Dao remains ever unchanged.

Distinguished into the Five Phases, they mutually engender and overcome. Dispersed into yin and yang, they advance and retreat. In an instant they part, forms suddenly alter; in a flash they converge, forms shift and change. Revolving without cease, they complete transformations, and from this all things are born.

*Zhuangzi* says: “The spirit arises from the Dao; form originates from essence.” I ponder this Dao—it emerges from profound obscurity. The foolish do not discern or know, yet claim to have attained life. Without the eye of Dao, how can one know the numinous?

The *Scripture* says: “Profound and obscure, within it lies essence.” *Zhuangzi* says: “The essence of the supreme Dao is profoundly obscure.” For “profound” is the utmost depth of darkness, and “obscure” is the concealment of light. Within this profound obscurity lies the source of utmost yin, where the first stirrings of Heaven give rise to essence. The utterly foolish remain benighted all their lives, deluded about the root and origin of the Dao, believing things arise of themselves. Lacking clear vision, how can they perceive the world’s subtlest essence? Yet it is by this that things are born, and by this that the spirit becomes numinous.

Heaven and earth, all things—emptiness and fullness abound. All emerge from non-being, sharing a single origin though bearing different names. The One is the beginning of form’s transformations: the pure and light ascend to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descend to become Earth; the harmonious qi becomes humankind. Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born. Yet what fills the space between Heaven and Earth is nothing but the myriad things. Though things differ in ten thousand ways, all return to the One. The One’s arising springs from non-being. Heaven and Earth are born together with me; the myriad things and I are one—one must not regard them as separate. Though Heaven is high and Earth low, though the myriad things scatter and diverge, these are but differences of name.

This is also fundamentally non-existent; its correctness lies in its use. The word is not the true word—only then can one know its truth. One should discuss this with the enlightened, not argue with the foolish. What was once deemed right may later be rejected; what was once discarded may later be employed. That is one right and wrong, this is another—truly, right and wrong in the world cannot be fixed. What is used becomes base; what was correct at the time is deemed right only by its use.

The Dao is ever nameless; we style it “Dao.” The name “Dao” is but a borrowed term for its operation. Only when one knows that the word is not the true word does one cease to seek it outwardly and perceive it within, cease to grasp at it outwardly and attain it within. Turning inward to find sincerity—this is the utmost truth of the Dao, known as clearly as one sees with one’s own eyes.

Yet this may be spoken to the wise, not to the vulgar. As the *Tradition* says: “The words of the wise are fundamentally incomprehensible to the foolish.” You must seek correct teachings and not heed perverse doctrines.

How does one know perversity? By being swayed by things.
How does one know foolishness? By failing to examine words and their intent.

To inquire into the Dao, ask about the Dao; to inquire into the scriptures, ask about the scriptures. Those who do not grasp root and branch remain in foolish obscurity. They seek only blessings, unaware of the bonds of sin; they seek only to nourish the body, unaware of its destruction.

The Dao has both correctness and perversity—what is correct? Standing centered without leaning, moving laterally without drifting: this is the correct Dao. What is perverse? Using falsity to overcome truth, chasing things and forgetting to return, deviating from the correct Dao—these are all perverse doctrines.

The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, thus it is the root. The scriptures are the words that convey the Dao, thus they are the branch. The foolish, blind to great principle, stumble along darkened paths. Not only do they fail to understand the root, they also fail to grasp the branch. Seeking blessings thus, they only invite the destruction of their forms.

*Zhuangzi* says: “All seek blessings; I alone seek to preserve wholeness.” And again: “To nourish the body, one must first provide for things—yet there are those who have things in excess yet fail to nourish their forms.” The posture of an infant is prized for its rich nurturance. Neglecting to cultivate form, one knows life is not eternal. Without treading the great brightness, how can one attain enduring existence?

The infant’s qi is concentrated, its will unified; it moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Thus blessings do not come, nor do misfortunes. Its posture is radiant and beautiful. What is prized in nourishing the body lies in the richness of its inner virtue, simple and uncarved. Thus it possesses the countenance of an infant without incurring the misfortunes of sin or bodily destruction. Observing how infants suddenly emerge from nothingness to take form, one thereby knows the impermanence of life’s Dao.

The utmost extremity of the supreme Dao is dim and silent. Though the sage embodies the Dao with luminous clarity in all four directions, he alone remains as if in darkness. Thus he preserves his body, avoids harm, and escapes the calamities of the human realm.

The *Daoist Scripture*, in the chapter “Knowing the Male,” speaks of “returning to the state of an infant,” followed by “knowing the white, guarding the black”—its meaning aligns with this. What subtle intent lies in seeking to overthrow one another? Even the deep bond between father and son does not entail blind obedience. The Dao is profound and wondrous, one with the spirit. Below the Dao, all is coarse and not subtle.

The common people, ignorant of the root of perfect compliance, vainly seek blessings; unaware of the canons of preserving life, they indulge in nourishing the body. They conspire together, pursuing this without cease—what subtle intent could there be in this?

The relationship between father and son is founded on affection. If a father were to instruct his son thus, the son would not blindly obey—how much less should others? Do not clamor or sigh, lest you be mocked by near and far.

Concealing faults and extolling virtues is the principle the noble person upholds. *Jiao* means to call out; the *Records* say: “Do not respond with clamor.” *Kai* means to sigh; the *Poetry* says: “Alas, how he sighs!” To enlighten those who come after with what one knows first lies in patient and gentle guidance, nurturing them so they seek for themselves—not in clamorous insistence on forced instruction. Not only does this fail to benefit the learner, it may bring ridicule from near and far.

The petty man delights in exposing others’ faults and proclaiming their virtues—surely this is what the noble person esteems and practices.

**Chapter Seven: On Deviance and Rectitude**

The Venerable Lord said: Deviant teachings and upright words alike accord with nature. Thus fortune and misfortune arise, responding to the seeds one sows—as surely as a planted kernel reveals its kind. Deviance and rectitude do not intermix, just as square and circle serve different purposes. Though their doctrines may be disordered, their auspicious and inauspicious outcomes follow as shadows follow form, each bearing the fruits of what it cultivates. This is like plants and trees, distinct in their categories.

Here the Dao diverges, for words may be false or true. The false Dao nourishes the form; the true Dao nourishes the spirit. The true spirit communes with the Dao, able to vanish or endure. The spirit can make the form take flight, even shifting mountains. When the form turns to ash and dust, what awareness remains?

How could the Dao be concealed, that it bears true and false? Once true and false are distinguished, the Dao’s division becomes clear. All beyond the *quan* is called false—sounds, colors, scents, and flavors are of this kind, merely nourishing the form. All within the *quan* is called true Dao and virtue—nature and life are of this kind, upon which the spirit depends for sustenance.

*Mencius* says: “The body has lesser and greater parts. To nourish the lesser is to be a petty person; to nourish the greater is to be a great person.” The true Dao nourishes the spirit—this is nourishing the greater. Only by knowing what to nourish can one refine the spirit to merge with the Dao, uniting with the true. Then one seems to vanish yet endures, effortlessly formless yet spiritually present. Ascending in flight is but a minor matter—grasping the cosmos and transforming heaven and earth are easily accomplished, far beyond merely shifting mountains!

It is said: “Those who lose my Dao appear as light above yet become dust below.” Having nourished the lesser, they forsake the true Dao and revert to dust, decaying into corruption. How could they attain the marvel of a flying form?

The ears and eyes, sounds and colors—these are the faults one clings to. The nose and mouth’s desires, fragrances and flavors—these are one’s foes. The body is the root of affliction, of pain and itching, cold and heat. The mind is the source of the form’s thoughts, of sorrow, poison, worry, and vexation. Bound by the body, I know it to be the great calamity. Looking to past and present, who remains with form intact? My hair now white, how many years of decline remain?

The ear craves the five sounds, yet they deafen; the eye desires the five colors, yet they blind. Fragrance and flavor are what the nose and mouth yearn to inhale and taste—yet sweet richness becomes the medicine that rots the intestines, and heady incense the smoke that scorches the throat. Outwardly, the body cannot escape the ravages of yin and yang; inwardly, the will cannot flee the perils of the human path. Thus, to possess a body is to sigh in lament.

For where there is being, there is decay; where all is nothingness, there is no end. Only by exhausting the spirit and abiding in solitude can one preserve the body whole. Yet even those born must perish—even the sage of Primordial Unity shows mortals the visage of decline and age. How much more so for those confined within the great transformations!

I, for my part, have cast off the vulgar and wearied of worldly entanglements. Embracing the Origin and guarding the One, I cross over to the realm of immortals. The Origin is the root of abandonment; the One, the beginning of bodily transformation. Hold fast without letting go, guard without losing—then one may leave things and people behind, standing alone. How could this be the same as drifting with the common herd or mingling in the filth of the world?

You have not yet learned to guard the One, but sit instead in the seat of honor and office. The highest rank may rival the nobility of a state, yet if you know what to guard, you will see all fleeting honors as mere shadows gathering upon the body. What glory is there in such things? This is why Guan Yin claimed illness to abandon his post.

If you can remain unmoved, the spirit finds peace. If you can cast off desire, all undertakings will be preserved whole. If you can practice non-action, I will know your resolve is firm. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from movement; no sin is greater than yielding to desire. If you can be still and unmoving, quieting the heart and shedding desire, then the spirit will guard the form, and all affairs will be mastered. Only through simplicity and non-action, through unceasing sincerity, can one attain this.

Now I reveal and lay bare these truths for you, dissecting and distinguishing, separating the real from the false. You must listen carefully and devote yourself to the Dao with diligence.

The Dao cannot be transmitted through words, yet without words it cannot be made manifest. Through explanation, doubt is dispelled and confusion resolved—thus the Dao is clarified. Confucius said: “I have nothing hidden from you.” The Dao emerges through clarity; the scriptures come first in learning. The Dao reveals itself only to the enlightened; if one is not its proper vessel, the Dao does not flow in vain. The scriptures carry the Dao, and scholars grasp them to cross over to the Dao—just as one takes up a boat to cross a river.

Teaching is given to those who can practice it, regardless of wealth or poverty. Instruction and transformation, like music, make no distinction between the close and the distant. What is imparted must be put into action; the text must suit the person. Teach according to your student’s capacity, and the true essence of the Dao will not be lost. Teaching knows no categories—there is no hierarchy of selection. The key lies in finding the right person to entrust it to, so that the learner does not lose themselves, nor the teacher their disciple.

**Chapter Eight: Heaven and Earth**
The Old Master said: Heaven, earth, and all beings originate from the Dao’s Origin. Together they emerge from the Great Simplicity, the beginning of the Void and Primordial. The radiance of the finest essence, the subtlety of the supreme Mystery—

The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things. When the undifferentiated was divided, the light and pure became heaven—this is the Dao giving birth to the One. The heavy and turbid became earth—this is the One giving birth to the Two. The harmonious qi became humans—this is the Two giving birth to the Three. From this, the myriad things fill the space between, all born of the Dao, emerging from the formless prior to the Great Simplicity. Within the indistinct, there are images; within the profound darkness, there is essence. The Mystery within the Mystery—this is the gate of all wonders. As the tradition says: the teeming myriad things all grow from non-action.

It is like a vast chasm, beneath which flows a gentle spring. Though it appears faint and murky, one cannot see the sand at the bottom. Deep and obscure, its source is unknown. It is like the departed dead—one does not see their spirit. When pure yin and yang unite, yang cannot manifest distinctly.

As *Liezi* says: “Qi, form, and substance exist together yet remain undivided”—this is called the undifferentiated. The undifferentiated means all things are intermingled and inseparable. It cannot be seen, heard, or grasped—the Dao’s profound mystery is difficult to fathom, not merely like the spring in the deep valley or the spirit of the departed. The past and the yet-to-come, seen through analogy, reveal what lies ahead.

Those who cannot yet grasp principle—how can they know what persists and what perishes?
It is like one afflicted with sores and ulcers, unable to convey speech to others.
To play the five notes for the deaf—how could they hear?
Yet those with keen discernment and wisdom receive instruction as if words were transmitted directly.
They claim to comprehend its essence, but their innermost being remains untouched by truth.
Thus they lose the root of life—how then can they know the origin of the Dao?

The Dao does not spread—I know why:
the wise exceed it, the foolish fall short.
What has passed cannot be known;
what is to come remains unknowable;
even the present eludes understanding.
If fools are thus, how can they fathom the discourse on life and death?
To speak of the Dao’s subtlety is like making the mute speak or the deaf discern sound.
Even those of vast talent and erudition, whose wisdom suffices to reach it,
still rely on cleverness and prideful thought.
They grasp its words but not the source of those words.
Seeking the Dao in forms, colors, names, and reputations is insufficient to attain it.
How could they truly know its essence—the root of life, the origin of the Dao?

**Chapter on Practicing the Dao, Ninth**
The Old Master said:
If you practice my Dao, you must know the source of supreme wisdom.
Wisdom does not arise alone; it requires corresponding causes.
Wisdom is the substance of insight; insight is the function of wisdom.
Great wisdom is vast and unhurried; petty wisdom is narrow and restless.
Supreme insight and great wisdom observe near and far,
arising from resonance, responding to conditions.
They act without contrivance, never forcing—
how could they be obscured by partiality or self-interest?

Each has a predestined nature, a mandate and fortune they have heard of.
Those who walk the same Dao attain it;
those of shared virtue share its root.
If in past lives one did not inquire or learn,
now they have lost their neighbor to truth.
Thus success and failure arise, and they take no joy in the Dao’s teachings.

When fate is established, does it not pertain to human affairs?
Though fate arrives unbidden,
life and death, nobility and baseness,
fortune and misfortune, long life and early death—
all stem from past deeds.
Accumulated good and evil bring blessings and calamities,
each according to its kind,
without the slightest deviation,
responding as echo follows sound.
Those who follow the Dao unite with the Dao;
those who embody virtue unite with virtue;
those who err unite with error—
it depends entirely on what one practices.

Greed for profit, glory, and favor,
accepting gifts while mindful of gratitude and toil,
further enriching with wealth,
yet showing no pity for the poor below—
surely this breeds much resentment,
leaving no stable ground.
Without a clear teacher, how can one resolve doubts?

The avaricious chase wealth, thus burdened by gain;
the ambitious chase fame, thus burdened by renown.
Day and night, they ponder good and ill,
their hearts filled with sorrow and vexation,
endlessly seeking more.
They exhaust themselves with labor,
hoarding without use,
wealth rotting, grain spoiling,
never lending to others.
Yet they indulge momentary wrath,
unleashing fleeting anger,
clashing and grinding against others,
unable to stop—
do they yet know how to hold to great stillness?

They fail to realize: which is dearer, fame or life?
Which is greater, life or wealth?
Resentment is excess of benevolence;
petty strictness is the worm of righteousness.
Without a clear teacher, who can dispel their delusions and resolve their confusion?

My Dao is like a single hair—who can discern it clearly?
From the beginning of past ages,
all that has transpired is like dust and sand.
The Dao cannot be seen; what is seen is not it.
The Dao cannot be heard; what is heard is not it.
The Dao has no form or limit—how could it be as slight as a hair?

From ancient times to now,
the ways of governing the world have been countless.
Though minor paths may have their merits,
their reach is shallow, and they become mired.
With little learning, there is no restraint;
with little experience, no distinction.
Yet those who boast of vast knowledge and perception
lose the true Dao amid their many affairs.
They claim omniscience, yet the sage grows ever wiser.
As the saying goes: *"One who masters all things is called a sage."*

Action entails eons of toil—
I reflect and find it wearisome.
Only by learning nothing do I illuminate the natural.
Excellence matures over time, not through a single day’s accumulation.
As months pass and years turn,
diligence in practice perfects virtue.
Xunzi said: *"Accumulated goodness becomes virtue; spiritual clarity follows naturally."*
The sage’s heart follows this path, ultimately attaining sagehood.
Though achieved through learning,
how could one be confined by vulgar scholarship that drowns the mind?
True learning lies in unlearning—
this is why the cessation of learning brings no sorrow but joy.

Flowers and fruit return to their essence;
stem and leaves resemble the root.
To practice the Dao is to return to the ancestral origin,
to know the beginning and end.
You should be awakened by the formless;
do not be bound by the formed.

All things emerge from *Zhen*,
meet in *Li*,
then flourish together,
their splendor manifesting externally.
Joyful in *Dui*,
laboring in *Kan*,
they shed their blossoms and return to reality,
reverting to their nature’s dwelling.
As the classic says: *"The teeming things each return to their root."*
The teaching of the Primal Unity takes depth as its root,
simplicity as its guiding principle,
discerning things as its virtue,
and returning to life as its constant.
It sheds the flower to preserve the fruit,
gathers the scattered into oneness—
like the autumn and winter of the four seasons.

The formless ancestor is the world’s beginning;
all things turn their heads to it.
Yet how could this be sought through effort?

**Beginning of the Middle Scroll of the** *Scripture of Western Ascent*

The Lord Laozi said: I repeat my admonition to you—you must listen carefully. The Dao holds non-action (*wuwei*) as supreme. By constantly abiding in desirelessness, one observes its mystery; by constantly abiding in desire, one observes its manifestations. Virtue takes benevolence as its essence. Virtue admits no exclusion—this is benevolence. Ritual takes righteousness as its modesty, balancing things and distributing evenly, adapting to what is timely and fitting. Bestowal takes kindness as its bond. Moved by compassion, one extends it to all things, not seeking repayment—thus one’s bestowal is vast. Favor takes benefit as its priority. Favor is the application of benevolence, taking the benefit of things as its achievement. Mere verbal favor without substance brings resentment upon oneself. Trust takes efficacy as its foundation. Trust must be fulfilled in one’s words, and there must be visible results. Even in a world of falsity, this exists—though some use it to entice others. Thus one knows the world is shallow, adorning itself with embellishments. In the age of utmost virtue, these seven all arise from spontaneity. When virtue declines, these seven all emerge from compulsion. Thus the Dao is obscured by minor achievements, virtue is harmed by petty knowledge. Ritual becomes artificial, bestowal seeks repayment, favor does not come from the heart, trust does not arise from sincerity—all are feigned emotions, nature is bartered for reputation, wisdom is adorned to astonish the foolish. How can this be natural?

Words fly before the soaring dragon; deeds lag behind the limping turtle. Benevolence and righteousness decay, ritual and trust are abandoned—morality and the Dao lie in ruins. The soaring dragon is swift, yet words still precede it; the limping turtle is slow, yet deeds still lag behind it. This is because speaking is not difficult, but acting is truly hard.

When the Dao is lost, then virtue follows; when virtue is lost, then benevolence follows. Ritual comes afterward, and when ritual and trust are abandoned, the state of morality and the Dao is clear. Not using the Dao to examine one another, but instead relying on wealth to support one another—this is like a reflection in a mirror: visible but not graspable. Words are like echoes in a valley: the sound of wind cannot be gathered. The teachings of this false world have long led people astray. The noble pursue the Dao; the petty pursue wealth.

The ancients took examination as their order, for they examined one another by the Dao. By the end of the Zhou decline, people no longer knew to walk alongside the Dao and support one another, but instead relied on wealth to support one another. This is like grasping at wind or seizing shadows to seek their reality—how can it be attained? There is no other reason: the Dao has no means to flourish in the world, and the world has no means to flourish by the Dao. Minor delusions distort direction; great delusions distort nature. The prevalence of hypocrisy obscures the truth of spontaneity.

The scripture says: The people’s delusion has long been firmly established. Among all things under heaven, who alone is the constant master? Delusion is passed down in succession, turning and transmitting to one another. Falsehood and deception enter the real; emptiness and nothingness appear as if existent. The myriad things blow differently, yet who causes them to rage on their own? The wondrous essence is without peer; the true and constant does not govern. It can be attained but not transmitted in words; it can be transmitted but not conferred. Those of limited understanding take the branches for the great source, mistake the worn path for the utmost mystery, passing delusion to delusion—like the drunk carrying the drunk. They do not know that sincerity and uprightness can enter the real, while falsehood and deception can never enter the real with falsehood. Thus they take the semblance of the empty and originless as existent, though it is not truly so.

When one cannot distinguish the false from the real, one clings to profit and guards it. The unchanging and upright perish; the deluded and blind blame themselves. Like fire born from wood, it returns to burn the wood to rot. First establish oneself, then judge others. The inner master can rectify the outer. If one is false oneself, how can one discern the truth or falsehood of others? One’s falsity arises from pursuing and guarding profit. Pursuing profit distances one from the Dao; guarding profit loses the Dao. Since it is not the true and constant, uprightness also perishes. There is no other reason: one doubts the Dao and acts recklessly, thus violating others and bringing blame upon oneself. How is this different from wood producing fire that then consumes the wood? The *Yinfu Jing* says: Fire is born from wood, and disaster arises to destroy it.

**Chapter Eleven: The Words of the Sage**
The Lord Laozi said: The words of the sage state: The Primordial Vastness is the true person. Uttering words as scripture, I make the ancient anew. Yet I do not boast, calling them "the words of the sage"—for the deluded do not act.

The Dao should be observed through its methods. As that from which things are born, it is called the natural. The unchanging is the Dao; the coarse that cannot but be expounded is the method. The Dao is not visible—it is revealed through method. Dao and method are not originally two: entering, it is the Dao; issuing, it is the method. The things under heaven are born endlessly, yet who knows by what they are born? It is simply from the natural. The Dao is revealed through method; method is established by the Dao. Is this man-made?

The eye sees, and the heart is moved. There is no greater thief than virtue with a heart, and the heart has eyes. Kan is the ear; Li is the eye. Ears and eyes are the doors and windows of the spirit. Once something is seen, the heart moves outward. The *Yinfu Jing* says: The mechanism lies in the eye. The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes—this is why.

The mouth is the heart’s gatekeeper. Words are the voice of the heart. What the heart desires cannot be expressed without words—the mouth truly governs this. The nose is the passage for wind and qi. The nose and mouth are the gates of wind and qi; breathing is the dwelling of life. The body’s longevity is established at the root of breath. Like valleys, grasses, and trees, the four seasons’ qi flows and flourishes. When qi diverges, the living die; when it increases or decreases, emaciation and illness arise.

What humans rely upon is breath, and the exit and entry of breath occur through the nose. One exhalation, one inhalation—yin and yang reside within. Gathered, it is life; dispersed, it is death. Thus life’s dwelling is here. The true person breathes through the heels; the common person breathes through the throat. The root of breath has its foundation, deeply established and firmly rooted. Thus it is equal in longevity to heaven and earth.

As with the hundred grains and grasses, all things rely on the four qi to grow and flourish—prospering when abundant, withering when diminished. When qi scatters, the living perish. Thus, where there is life and death, it is not as peaceful as non-action. In non-action, nothing is pursued, so how could there be fault or transgression?

You do not covet the body’s form, nor do you resent the workings of existence. The mandate endures through a hundred ages, unchanged from ancient times to the present; nature transforms through ten thousand forms yet remains unaltered. From the beginning, there was no life or death. That things have life and death is because they lose the true nature of their mandate. Only through non-action can one preserve the true nature of the mandate. Action brings completion and deficiency, and with them, right and wrong arise. Non-action brings no failure—what fault or transgression could there be?

People of the world cannot escape action because they cling to the self. If one could cast off the limbs and forget them, discard the body’s form and no longer possess it, then though one does nothing, nothing would remain undone. The five phases would not overcome one another, and all things could be preserved whole. All things lack constancy; what is completed does not endure. Yet that which completes transformation, moves as ghosts and spirits, and traverses heaven and earth without exhaustion—these are the five phases. Going and coming, waxing and waning, they mutually generate to perpetuate one another, mutually overcome to govern one another. Bound within the great transformation, they must have life and must have death, yet none can escape the reaping.

The sage commands creation, governs the ten thousand things, grasps yin and yang, and overturns the five phases without mutual harm. Thus, he attains mastery over existence and non-existence, entering into neither death nor life. But once something is made into an object, completion and decay follow one another. To desire it to endure without perishing—how could that be possible? Only the Dao endures for ten thousand generations without decay. As the scripture says: *The Dao endures.*

The three luminaries are not inherently bright or dark; heaven and earth remain ever radiant. Heaven accumulates qi, earth accumulates form, and the sun, moon, and stars are but the radiant qi within that accumulation. People see only their coming and going, their concealment and appearance, their obscurity and brightness, unaware that the changes of dusk and dawn, light and dark, are distinct. The three luminaries and the two forces remain constant.

*Observing All Things, Chapter Twelve*
Lord Lao said: Observe all things to cultivate the Dao, and preserve the spirit in contemplation. The Dao’s qi harmonizes the three luminaries; focus on what governs within the body. Hair and beard reflect waking and dreaming, as the spirit suddenly comes and goes. In emptiness and tranquility, without thought, one attains the supreme Dao. Guarding against evil and preserving sincerity, through thought one attains its next level.

For the spirit is wondrous and formless; preserving it keeps it close to form without departure. When the spirit is whole, essence is whole; when essence is whole, qi is whole. These three harmonize without discord. The three luminaries of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; the three luminaries of humans are spirit, qi, and essence. The way to harmonize the three luminaries is no other than turning the light inward, seeking fulfillment within oneself.

Within the human body, the true ruler resides. The five officials are all complete, the hundred bones and six viscera naturally govern one another. If one does not forget this, one befriends the spirit in the realm of indistinctness. This is the effect of laboring over hair and beard, waking and dreaming—where indistinctness lies between being and non-being.

With a mind free from striving and non-action, thoughts arise from contemplation. One may claim to be free from desire, yet not realize that holding to thoughts is different. "Tranquil" means not engaging with things; "still" means not flowing with movement. One who is devoted to the great Dao has no thought, no action, does not pursue things, nor flows with activity—how could there be thoughts of contemplation? For where there is contemplation, distinctions arise; where there is thought, the mind is not free. To call this "stillness" is already to move; to call it "desireless" is already to fall into desire.

The governance of the world unfolds in many ways, yet all assume their methods cannot be improved, thus taking themselves as correct. Unaware of the differing faults in holding to thoughts, the Dao thus has distinctions of great and small. Thoughts may be true or false: not lingering on what has passed and responding only after perception—this is true thought. Clinging to the past without selection, or anticipating what has not yet come—this is false thought. This is why preserving the spirit in contemplation is considered the next level.

If one’s qi is still coarse and abundant, one knows there are many affairs. Affairs arise, the body moves, and movement connects outwardly to schemes. Scheming is the beginning of danger; danger leads to impermanence. Impermanence leads to decline, and decline leads to shortened life. The will is the commander of qi. When the mind is wearied by schemes and wisdom exhausted by affairs, qi falters. Pursuing what is not upright leads to violent excess.

Abandoning affairs, the body does not labor; at rest, schemes are not employed. Once scheming begins, cunning and change arise, and a myriad of disturbances follow. Weary and toiling, one loses the way—how difficult it is to complete one’s natural lifespan without dying prematurely! The perfected person does not engage in worldly affairs, nor conspire with others. Cleansing external desires and profoundly contemplating the ultimate principle, he concentrates qi to attain softness, becoming like an infant.

Observing fame and reputation through the body, one sees how things and affairs are hard to gather. To be known by name and title is to be led astray by them. All this stems from covetous desire, and covetous desire is the source of calamity. Covetousness is the greatest illness, cultivated over a long time. It grows subtly and gradually, not something moxibustion or acupuncture can cure.

One limb is weightier than a kingdom; two arms are weightier than the world—so which is closer, fame or the body? Things have no constant rightness, affairs no constant suitability. Letting go without clinging, they never pause for even a moment—how much less can one rely on what comes by chance! Such fleeting things cannot be fenced in or halted. Yet those burdened by lofty names pursue fame relentlessly, harming life and injuring nature, sacrificing the body—all because of covetous desire. No misfortune is greater than desiring gain, so covetousness is the body’s greatest illness. The people have been deluded for a long time; the habit runs deep. What begins small ends in great excess, like a disease in the vital organs—no moxibustion or acupuncture can cure it.

Return to the desires of the body and mind, preserving purity and guarding the self.

This is the practice of the great sages, who do not covet what others cherish.
What is constant can be made to vanish; what is inconstant can be made to endure.

For bodily illness, when severe, moxibustion and acupuncture cannot reach it.
For illness of nature, when grave, minor teachings cannot transform it.
Covetous desire is the gravest illness of nature.
To return to one’s nature and restore its original state,
one must reduce and reduce again, until reaching non-action.
Then purity cannot be defiled, stillness cannot be stained,
and one no longer knows what is being guarded.

For non-action is the practice of the sage,
while covetous desire is what the multitude cherishes.
Walking the great Dao’s path of non-action,
not coveting what the multitude desires—
then the affairs, forms, and names that the world calls "being"
can be made to vanish,
while tranquility, indifference, and emptiness,
which the world calls "non-being,"
can be made to endure.

**Scriptural Admonitions, Chapter Thirteen**
The Old Master said: What the scriptural admonitions declare is the principle to which the Dharma’s meaning points.

Vast and resplendent prosperity is not as good as subtlety and wonder. The sutras convey the Dao, and their words are nothing but teachings and admonitions; the Dharma reveals the Dao, and its principles can be examined and extended. All things take the root as their essence and the manifest as their coarse form. Vast and resplendent prosperity is the momentum of things, yet momentum is bound to exhaust itself in time. Profound subtlety and primal mystery are the root of the Dao, and the Dao is never exhausted in time. Measured by this distinction of essence and coarseness, the gap between the Dao and things is vast indeed.

The solid is not as good as the empty. The solid is obstructive, while the empty is without hindrance. Frequency is not as good as rarity. Serving a lord too frequently brings humiliation; befriending others too often leads to estrangement. Hasty action may yield quick results, but urgency is not as good as slowness. Haste makes waste; great vessels mature late, and true excellence takes time. What rises must fall, and what flourishes must decline. The sun at its zenith begins to wane, the moon at its full begins to wane—even heaven and earth are thus, how much more so for man? The sage severs knowledge and acts through non-action, speaks through non-speech, and moves without imposing. Who can comprehend this? The essential wonder of the Dao, though vast in wisdom, cannot be sought through wisdom. Only by leaving form and abandoning knowledge can one merge with the great thoroughfare. Only by discarding knowledge and habit can one follow the principle of heaven. Thus, the sage, in all speech and action, takes the severance of knowledge as primary—this is the reason. Yet how could the world understand?

"Acting through non-action" means engaging in affairs of non-action. "Speaking through non-speech" means speaking throughout one’s life as if one had never spoken. "Moving without imposing" means conducting affairs without affairs. The even is not as good as the odd. That which stands alone and never changes is the Dao. From the Dao downward, all things have counterparts and dependencies. The sage does not stand paired with things but abides in singularity, for he embodies the Dao. Abundance is not as good as scarcity. When one is attuned to the One, all matters are complete. Scarcity brings attainment; abundance brings confusion. Who is wise is hard to follow. Who is benevolent is hard to approve, for their principles are rarely adhered to. The world calls some "wise"—but who truly is wise? The wise may exceed the Dao and thus be impossible to follow. The world calls some "benevolent"—but who truly is benevolent? The benevolent may lose the Dao, and their worth remains unseen. If even benevolence and wisdom are thus, how few adhere to the profound mysteries of the Dao—this much is clear.

To know the knowledge of non-knowledge is the pivot of the Dao. Shallow knowledge is superficial; deep knowledge is beyond knowing. To know the knowledge of non-knowledge is true knowledge. The fundamental source of the Dao lies here. Empty, void, extinguished, and none—what use are immortal flights? The great Dao is vast and unbounded, governing all without constraint. Emptiness is not nothingness but the absence of solidity. To empty the empty is to reach the ultimate emptiness. None is the counterpart of being, arising from being and thus not yet free from being. To extinguish none is to make even none nonexistent. Thus, one may enter and exit the six directions, roam the nine provinces, come and go alone, and move above the myriad things—compared to this, immortal flight is hardly worth mentioning. For the Dao is vast and all-encompassing, never bounded, embracing the six extremes without beginning or end. From the greatness of heaven and earth to the minuteness of an autumn hair, all lie within its compass—how could it be limited to the single matter of immortal flight?

One version reads: "Empty and extinguished, becoming none—this can be used for immortal flight." If you can illuminate this, what was deemed wrong becomes right. The sutras speak with careful truth—who can follow it? That, too, is a matter of right and wrong; this, too, is a matter of right and wrong. The right and wrong of the world are not yet settled. Yet true right and wrong do exist. To affirm what was once denied, nothing is better than clarity. For one who knows oneself is enlightened. If one can know oneself, then what was once deemed right may ultimately be seen as wrong, and the true right and wrong will be revealed. The sutras’ words clarify right and wrong—how could they be false? The greatly deluded remain unenlightened their whole lives; the greatly foolish remain dull their whole lives. Without the sutras’ careful and truthful words, who could correct the errors of the deluded and foolish?

**Profound Wonder, Chapter Fourteen**
The Old Master said: The Dao’s words are profound and wondrous; the sutras’ admonitions are subtle and hidden. The Dao is deep and hard to fathom, wondrous and hard to name. The sutras convey the Dao, so their exhortations are also mysterious and concealed.

All things in heaven and earth are born from the One. If you can illuminate this, you will know the empty and the full. If you cannot perceive it, even the manifest will remain indistinct. In the great beginning, there was nonexistence, and nonexistence had no name. The One arose, and there was One, yet no form. When things obtained it and were born, it was called virtue. The One is the beginning of all transformations. From heaven and earth to the myriad things, all arise from it—thus, the root of all under heaven lies here. Those who practice the Dao should illuminate this root. For when one is attuned to the One, all matters are complete. To know the One is to know all; not to know the One is to know nothing. Unless one perceives it in the heavens and sees it for oneself, even if it is clearly explained, one will not awaken—how much less so for subtle words?

If your will clings to being, non-action will be your affliction. To be entangled in being is to labor endlessly without completion. Non-action never fails; action entails success and loss. Non-action is the root of the Dao; action is the Dao’s affliction. The world’s pursuits all fall into being. Unable to reduce the solid to achieve thoroughfare, they become entangled both externally and internally, impossible to untie—this is due to long-accumulated habit. Only the sage can then untie the knots.

The Dao’s words are subtle and deep—you have yet to distinguish them. Grasp the essentials, be vigilant, and do not lose them. Awakening to the Dao is sudden; practicing the Dao is gradual. Delusion and awakening arise from one’s nature and cannot be achieved by human effort. Practicing the Dao is accomplished through accumulated habit—it lies in careful adherence and not losing it. For the Dao’s utmost wonder is attained through awakening, and the essence of practicing the Dao lies in learning much and then guarding it.

First relinquish all desires, lest the mind become reckless. No sin is greater than what desire makes permissible; dispel desire, and the heart will naturally settle. The mind gives rise to intention when stirred by something—without restraint, it may lead to ruin. Thus, to rectify the heart, first make the intention sincere.

Dwell in seclusion, abide in stillness, and refine your thoughts in a purified chamber. Abandon affairs, and the body will not labor; contemplate, and you will attain it—without contemplation, you will not. Ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts are not equal to guarding the One. The Dao does not favor complexity; complexity breeds distraction. Penetrate the One, and all matters are complete.

The classics are not obscure, yet they contain emptiness and fullness. Words that assert "must be nonexistent"—you have yet to distinguish them. Words that assert "must be existent"—you have yet to decide. Simply proceed in practice, and what arises will naturally dissolve.

Parables make up ninety percent, reiterations seventeen—parables expand meaning, reiterations affirm truth. Thus, what the texts speak of—emptiness and fullness, existence and nonexistence—remains indeterminate. Only by grasping the intent behind the words can one truly know. If still unknowing, provisionally take the texts as correct and practice accordingly; through reduction upon reduction, one may attain non-action.

The *Tradition* states: "What the world values is the Dao in books." The Dao has truth and falsehood; fortune has misfortune and blessing. Action leads to falsehood, non-action to truth. Gaining fortune through falsehood brings misfortune; attaining blessing through truth brings good fortune.

Sins may be public or private; clarity may be subtle or precise. To do evil in the open—people may punish it. To do evil in darkness—spirits may punish it. Heaven’s net is vast and wide, coarse yet unerring; how could the slightest subtlety escape? Divining the past to know the future is not as good as simplicity. Foresight is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly. The common folk are bright and discerning, while I alone seem dim; the common folk are sharp and exacting, while I alone am dull and questioning. Though one may possess the clarity to know fortune and misfortune without divination, it is not equal to the simplicity of those who sing of returning to the uncarved block. The *Daoist Classic* concludes by saying, "Govern with the nameless simplicity"—this is its meaning.

**Chapter Fifteen: Emptiness and Nothingness**
The Old Master said: Emptiness and nothingness give rise to spontaneity; spontaneity gives rise to the Dao. The *Profound Depths Chapter* states: "The Dao is profoundly deep, the abyss of emptiness and nothingness." This speaks of the Dao as the root of emptiness and nothingness. The *Daoist Classic* says: "The Dao models itself on spontaneity." This means that when the Dao descends, it follows spontaneity. Yet here it says, "Emptiness and nothingness give rise to spontaneity; spontaneity gives rise to the Dao"—why? For when speaking of the primordial void, spontaneity is already within it; when speaking of spontaneity, the Dao is already within it. Spoken separately, one is split into three; spoken together, three are threaded into one. From the perspective of having nothing, it is called emptiness and nothingness; from having no cause, it is called spontaneity; when it responds contingently, it is called the Dao. Where is there any distinction of before and after?

The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things. Change transforms into the One—the One is the beginning of form’s transformation. The clear and light ascends to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descends to become Earth. Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things transform and arise. The myriad things embrace the One to take form. The myriad things transform through essence into form; the One is the number of essence. Tracing to its beginning, it is born from attaining the One; summarizing its end, it is completed by embracing the One.

It attains the subtle and wondrous transformations of qi. The world is pervaded by a single qi. From the formed to the formless, from the sentient to the insentient, the wondrous and the foul, the fragrant and the rotten—all change with time, all driven by qi. When it gathers, there is life; when it scatters, there is death. When abundant, there is flourishing; when diminished, there is withering. It cannot be grasped, dark and unfathomable—truly subtle and wondrous.

Humans possess a treasure of longevity, yet they cannot preserve it, instead seeking ever greater honor and glory—this is called abandoning the root. It is the way of Heaven and Earth’s generation. Gold and jade fill the halls, yet none can preserve them. Things have their time and come to an end—how can they last forever? The true nature of life and destiny is born with birth. The wealth of a nation and its treasures—how could it be merely the weight of a Sui pearl? The deluded lose their priceless simplicity, boasting of external admiration; they have strayed far from the root.

Giving birth to Heaven and Earth is the root of the Dao. *Zhuangzi* says: "The Dao has its root and origin, existing since ancient times, giving birth to Heaven and Earth."

**Chapter Sixteen: Vast and Indistinct**
The Old Master said: Emptiness and vast indistinctness are the root of the Dao. Emptiness has no substance; nothingness is not being. "Vast" means having light but no form; "indistinct" means having unity but no shape. Within emptiness and vast indistinctness, the root resides. *Zhuangzi* says: "Fleeting as if vanished yet present, formless yet spiritually potent." This is what is called the root.

The myriad things share a common root—the origin of the Dao. Great indeed is the origin of Qian, from which the myriad things receive their beginning; profound indeed is the origin of Kun, from which the myriad things receive their birth. The origin is the beginning of qi, the function of the Dao. Heaven’s generation of things makes them of one root—how could there be two sources? The myriad things are of one storehouse, all emerging from the Dao. *Zhuangzi* says: "The myriad things and I are one."

If within oneself one does not perish, I remain silent. The sage writes books and establishes teachings with profound intent and earnest admonition, desiring to overturn the people’s inversion, return their nature and feelings, and restore their original state. If all under Heaven could inwardly observe and find sufficiency, not losing the truth within themselves, the sage would quietly withdraw, beyond the reach of words.

*Mencius* says: "Was I fond of disputation? I had no choice."

**Chapter Seventeen: Birth and Placement**
The Old Master said: It births me in emptiness, places me in nothingness. Emptiness transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into form—thus things are born. The ethereal soul returns to Heaven, the corporeal soul returns to Earth, the bones and skeleton return to their root—what remains of me? It simply returns to nothingness.

The Old Master said: "It births me in emptiness"—this speaks of the origin and beginning. "It places me in nothingness"—this speaks of the essential end. That which gives me life is spirit; that which destroys me is the heart-mind. When spirit guards its form, there is life; when spirit departs from form, there is death.

The human heart-mind is perilous, restless and ungovernable, impossible to restrain. Those petty men who abandon their forms—it is the heart-mind that drives them. This is why those who attain the Dao forget the heart-mind. The heart-mind and its intentions are my afflictions. If I am without heart-mind, what can I know? There is no greater thief than virtue with a heart-mind. With a heart-mind comes intention, and intention is the delusion of the heart-mind. People lament having a body because intention resides within it. If one could truly be without knowledge in the heart-mind, calming its intentions within, what lament would remain? Thus, the perfected person discards intention like a sheep. *Zhuangzi* says: "There is no weapon more harmful than the will; even the *zhen* and *you* are inferior."

Reflect on the time before I was born—there was no body, only the accumulation of qi and blood that formed this body. This body is the chariot of spirit, the dwelling of spirit, the master of spirit. When the master is at peace, spirit resides within; when it is restless, spirit departs. Examining its beginning, there was originally no life—not only no life, but originally no form. Qi transformed and there was form; form transformed and there was life. Once receiving human form, it moves as if turning without cease—who, dwelling in idleness, pushes it forward? Spirit alone subtly governs it. Ziyu said: "Treat spirit as a horse, and I ride it—how could I harness it otherwise?" Thus, it is said: "This body is the chariot of spirit."

Not only is it the chariot of spirit, but also its vessel. The body is the dwelling of spirit, and the reason form is born yet does not decay is because it preserves spirit. Preserve the form without loss, and spirit will come to dwell within. As the saying goes: "The seven apertures are the doors and windows of spirit"—it is clear that spirit takes the body as its dwelling.

The body is not only the dwelling of spirit but also its master. That which is affected is the master; that which responds is the guest. Spirit never precedes things; it responds to things and attaches to them, like a guest covered by the master and receiving commands from the master. Thus, it is clear that the body is the master of spirit. When the master is at peace, spirit resides within—form is whole, and spirit is complete. When it is restless, spirit departs—substance decays, and spirit is lost.

Therefore, the sage has no constant heart-mind, desiring to return to the original beginning, to revert to the state before birth. Inwardly observing the heart-mind, the heart-mind is without heart-mind—thus one can return to one’s nature and feelings and restore the original state. *Zhuangzi* says: "Having already become a thing, to return to the root is difficult—unless one is a great person, for whom it is easy." Before a person is born, how can there be a body? Without a body, what sorrow is there? What desire? Thus, those who set the body aside and preserve spirit retain their essence and radiance. When Dao and virtue unite, they merge with the Dao.

I have great lament because I have a body; when I have no body, what lament remains? The body is not mine—it is the entrusted form of Heaven and Earth. Life is not mine—it is the entrusted harmony of Heaven and Earth. To claim and possess them is delusion. Those who perceive the Dao do not burden their forms with profit, nor their hearts with their forms. The four limbs and hundred bones become dust and grime. Thus, they set the body aside, yet the body endures, and spirit is never constrained.

Thus, when form is whole and essence restored, one merges with Heaven and communicates with the Dao, uniting with virtue. For only after losing the Dao does virtue arise; after losing virtue, benevolence arises. When Dao and virtue unite, virtue encompasses the unity of the Dao, and there is neither completion nor destruction. Only the enlightened can speak of this.

**Chapter Eighteen: Practicing the Dao**
The Old Master said: Those of old who practiced the Dao did so by following nature. Thus, their Dao was constantly so. To force it to be so is to make it not so. Why? Because thought and念 give rise to opposition to the Dao.

The crooked does not rely on the hook, the straight does not rely on the marking-line, the round does not rely on the compass, the square does not rely on the carpenter’s square—this is the constant nature of all under Heaven. Those who practice the Dao dwell without thought, act without deliberation, follow nature, and harbor no intentions. How could they invite the calamities of "lengthening the crane’s legs" or "shortening the duck’s legs"? Thus, their Dao endures through ten thousand generations without decay.

Therefore, the *chong* and *yue* vessels depend on their user. Emptiness and fullness, being and non-being, square and round, large and small, long and short, wide and narrow—all are left to the user, without contention. The good person in the world is like the *chong* and *yue*—not contending with the myriad things, their virtue constantly returns to them. This is because they are empty and desireless.

The *chong* and *yue* are empty and thus can receive; receiving, they can respond—this nearly resembles the Dao. The good person in the world follows without opposing, responds without concealing, constantly abiding in the realm of non-contention. Thus, none in the world can contend with them. They are like the *suo* and *yue*—dwelling in weightiness, yet others do not belittle them; dwelling in precedence, yet others do not harm them. Their virtue constantly returns to them. *Zhuangzi* says: "Practice worthiness and abandon the conduct of self-worthiness—wherever you go, will you not be loved?"

Desire is the root of misfortune and harm; non-being is the origin of Heaven and Earth. None know its root; none know its origin. The sage abandons desire and enters non-being to nurture their body. There is no greater crime than what is desirable—thus it is the root of misfortune and harm. Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms, yet form arises from the formless—thus they are the origin of Heaven and Earth. People, having desires, vie for the passions of life and destiny, unaware of their root. Not seeing the purity of Heaven and Earth, they are unaware of its origin.

The sage is not thus. They purify the heart-mind, abandon desire, and wander in the wilds of non-being. Thus, they value and cherish their body, walking alongside the Dao.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Colored Body**

The Old Master said: All people regard sounds, sights, and rich flavors as the highest joy, yet they do not know that sounds, sights, and rich flavors are the raw material of misfortune. Thus, the sage does not desire and returns to non-desire.

Beautiful sights, melodious sounds, and rich flavors are what the world delights in. If the eyes do not obtain beautiful sights, the ears do not obtain sounds, and the mouth does not obtain rich flavors, then great sorrow and fear arise. Yet they do not know that the five colors blind the eyes, the five sounds deafen the ears, and the five flavors dull the palate—these three are the great afflictions of the body.

Now, the eyes’ indulgence in sights, the ears’ indulgence in sounds, and the mouth’s indulgence in flavors all arise from desire. There is no greater crime than what is desirable, and desire is the burden of virtue. Thus, the sage desires non-desire and returns to simplicity and purity.

---

**Chapter Twenty: The Dao as the Void**

The Old Master said: The Dao is a thing of emptiness and nothingness. It is as if the void were substantial and nothingness were being.

As a thing, the Dao is only vague and indistinct. Vague and indistinct, it seems as if it were not nothingness, yet not nothingness; as if it were being, yet not being. Though called emptiness and nothingness, to name it a "thing" is to speak of the thing that is no-thing.

The *Deep Chapter* speaks of the abyss of emptiness and nothingness; here, it speaks of the thing of emptiness and nothingness. The abyss describes its essence; the thing describes its function. Thus, it is said: "As if the void were substantial, nothingness were being." The *Zhuangzi* says: "When empty, it is full." "Nothingness being being" refers to what the *Dao De Jing* calls "these two emerge together yet have different names."

Heaven receives the one qi, vast and clear, and from it, qi descends to transform and give birth to the ten thousand things, each with its distinct form. When the Great *Yi* first divided, Heaven attained the one and became clear, while the ten thousand things took shape in budding diversity—all relying on it for their beginning. As the *Liezi* says: "Heaven and Earth intermingle, and the ten thousand things are transformed and born."

Thus, the sage knows that the Dao and virtue are undifferentiated and profoundly unified, and that Heaven and Earth’s clarity and stillness all abide in the one. Therefore, they harmonize their heart-mind with Heaven and Earth yet remain without knowledge; they unite their body with the Dao yet remain without form. Only then does the Dao of Heaven flourish.

Virtue is the totality of the Dao’s oneness, vast and undifferentiated, never departing from it throughout life. Profound and ever more profound, it is the gate of the myriad mysteries. Heaven attains this and thus effortlessly achieves clarity; Earth attains this and thus effortlessly achieves tranquility. If the sage can truly inquire into both, though the Dao of Heaven is distant, they perceive it with the heart. Thus, they are enlightened about Heaven and unite with non-knowledge; they penetrate the Dao and merge with formlessness. They become Heaven’s companion and the Dao’s oneness, and the Dao arises in the world.

This is to restrain the will and return the thoughts. It departs yet cannot be pursued; it remains yet cannot be sent away.

The will is the commander of qi; qi is the filling of the body. Hold fast to the will and do not harm the qi. Return to one’s nature and emotions and recover their origin, then thoughts will emerge from non-thought, and thinking will arise from non-thinking. What comes, do not forbid; what goes, do not stop. Do not send forth, do not welcome—respond yet do not store. Though ten thousand things are arrayed before you, none can enter your dwelling. As the *Yi* says: "What does the world think about? What does it ponder?"

What is distant emerges from beyond the infinite and cannot be exhausted; what is near lies within oneself, yet people do not see it. Though the sea is distant, governing it lies in the heart. Turn inward and seek within yourself, and the ten thousand things are all complete. Yet the Dao is near, and people seek it afar—this is like the eye’s clarity, which can see a hundred paces away yet cannot see its own lashes.

Thus, the noble person spends the whole day without looking, without listening, without speaking, without eating. They inwardly know and embrace the mysterious.

The *Commentary* says: "Inward vision is called clarity; reversed hearing is called acuity." Without looking or listening, the eyes see nothing, yet see clearly in darkness; the ears hear nothing, yet hear harmony in silence. As the *Yi* says: "The noble person is cautious in speech and moderate in eating and drinking." Without speaking or eating, they silently comprehend, and though they never speak throughout life, they have never not spoken. Free from hunger and thirst, they taste what others do not taste.

There is no other reason for this than returning to self-knowledge, embracing the one, and never departing from it.

If one desires to see, there is nothing to be seen. The sage sees the Dao and does not see things; thus, they see what others do not see. As the *Zhuangzi* says: "No thief is greater than virtue with a heart, and a heart with eyes." The *Classic* says: "The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes."

If one desires to hear, there is nothing to be heard. Hearing does not mean hearing others but hearing oneself—how could one listen with the ears? This is why Confucius, at sixty, attained harmony in hearing.

If one desires to speak, there is nothing to be said. Though the mouth speaks, there is no benefit or harm. Thus, what is called "having words" is "having no words," and what is called "having no words" is "having words"—and one wanders beyond the dust and grime.

If one desires to eat, there is nothing to be tasted. How bland and still! It cannot be tasted. Return to the state of no-thing. What can be tasted has been tasted, yet the one who tastes taste has never presented a taste. The taste is the Dao. The true person’s food is not sweet, for the Dao that comes from the mouth is bland and without flavor. Only those who return to their nature and emotions and recover their origin can attain this. The *Dao De Jing* speaks of "looking yet not seeing" and "listening yet not hearing," followed by "returning to no-thing"—this expresses the same idea.

If one can always be clear, still, and non-active, qi will naturally return. Return to the state before birth, and there is no body. Nurture the body with non-action, and the form remains whole. Heaven and Earth are full and abundant, and one preserves long life.

Emptiness transforms into spirit; spirit transforms into qi—this is the Dao’s accumulation. Qi transforms into spirit; spirit transforms into emptiness—this is the Dao’s function.

Now, when the will is unified, it moves qi; when qi is unified, it moves the will. Only by holding fast to the will and not harming the qi can one be empty and not defiled by things, still and not disturbed by things, bland and non-active. Then, qi will unite with spirit, spirit will unite with nothingness, and one will wander in the origin of things, transcending form and body without possessing them.

Because it does not live for itself, it can attain long life—thus preserving its form and bones, matching Heaven and Earth in enduring longevity. *Zhuangzi* states: "In non-action, one is *yuyu*." *Yuyu* means that worry and fatigue cannot enter, and one’s years and lifespan are long.

**Chapter Twenty-One: Lamenting Others**
The Old Master said: Lamenting others is not as good as lamenting oneself; lamenting oneself is not as good as cherishing spirit; cherishing spirit is not as good as containing spirit; containing spirit is not as good as guarding the body. To guard the body is to endure and abide long. What is the greatest thing to guard? Guarding the body is the greatest. The reason the body endures lies in nurturing spirit; the reason spirit remains whole lies in guarding the body. Cultivate the body, embrace spirit with stillness, and while others and things transform, I alone endure—this is the Way of long life and enduring vision, and it scarcely departs from this.

**End of the Middle Scroll of the *Xisheng Jing***

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Spirit Is Born**

The Old Master said: Spirit gives birth to form, and form completes spirit. Without spirit, form cannot generate itself; without form, spirit cannot fulfill itself. When form and spirit unite as one, they alternately give life and alternately achieve completion. The spirit is subtle beyond all things and is called thus—spirit gives birth to form. The body is the spirit’s chariot, and the spirit’s abode is form; thus form completes spirit. When spirit departs from form, it is called death, yet form does not arise without the Dao, for form relies on spirit to live. Life necessarily precedes the absence of separation from form, and when form is whole, spirit is whole, for spirit relies on form to achieve completion. The mutual dependence of form and spirit is like the reciprocal utility of being and non-being, neither of which can be neglected. Only when form and spirit are both wondrous do they merge with the true Dao.

Spirit constantly loves humanity, yet humanity does not love spirit. Gather your knowledge, unify it, and refine it—then spirit will come to dwell within. When the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, and the heart knows nothing, spirit will guard the form. Such is the love spirit bears for humanity. Yet spirit delights in purity, while the heart disturbs it; spirit delights in stillness, while desire drags it away. Proudly gazing outward and coveting external things, one chases after things and forgets to return. Not for a single breath does one inwardly preserve spirit, making it difficult to embrace spirit with stillness. The sage’s return to the constant is akin to having no knowledge; though sagely wisdom exists, it is set aside. Thus the spirit remains whole and unharmed, differing from the multitude.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Constant Peace**
The Old Master said: The sage abides in constant peace, at peace with heaven and earth, and ghosts and spirits commune with him. The multitude seeks peace in what is not peaceful, and thus finds no peace. The sage finds peace in what is peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not peaceful; the multitude does not find peace in what is peaceful but seeks peace in what is not peaceful. Finding peace in what is peaceful aligns with the Dao, and thus one’s longevity equals that of heaven and earth, able to assist the spirits—this is constant peace. Not finding peace in what is peaceful is to be obscured by things. One does not perish but awaits exhaustion; one’s conduct is like a gallop that cannot be stopped—what peace can there be?

For the Dao of heaven diminishes what is full, fills what is empty, destroys the strong, and benefits the weak. It reduces excessive thought and returns to childlike simplicity, blocks devious knowledge, and embodies the sage’s uncarved simplicity. When things reach their peak, they decline; when ascent reaches its limit, descent follows. What is hard will break, and what is sharp will be blunted—this is the principle of nature. The Dao of heaven humbles the high, raises the low, reduces the excessive, and supplements the deficient, for it follows nature without partiality. The sage emulates heaven, reducing and reducing again, without thought or worry, nurturing the upright with simplicity, returning to the state of an infant. By warding off deceit and preserving sincerity, refraining from cunning and artifice, one finds peace in what is peaceful and returns to uncarved simplicity.

Thus the world values filial piety, which can be called nurturing the mother. Constantly loving the mother ensures one’s own longevity. The world has a beginning, which is considered the mother of the world. The Dao is the mother of all things, and things are its children. The filial son, in caring for his parents, does not dare forget them in a single step or word. The sage embodies the Dao as if serving parents—how could he ever depart from it for even a moment?

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Body and Heart**
The Old Master said: When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the heart is without, harmonious qi returns. Those who cultivate the will forget the form; those who attain the Dao forget the heart. Leaving form and abandoning knowledge, one merges with the great thoroughfare. Then the body has no afflictions from form, and things naturally submit. Inwardly observing the heart, when the heart has no heart, the heart does not forcefully employ qi, and qi naturally returns.

Thus those who skillfully nurture the body conceal the body within the body and do not reveal it, conceal others within others and do not show them. Only those who conceal the world within the world can speak of this. Therefore, when the noble person governs, he must first die for the state. Having died yet not perished, his state flourishes. The people dare not scatter, and they become full again. When scholars see danger, they give their lives; loyalty and righteousness pledge the state. Dying to perfect benevolence, though dead, they do not perish. Obtaining worthies enables one to lay the foundation for great peace in the state. The state’s prosperity arises from this, and the people of the world, like fathers returning to their children, come forth—this is why the people become full.

If one can know the constant, one’s actions return to it. The multitude rejoices in pleasure, using it to generate life. Moving and losing it exhausts one’s lifespan. Returning to the constant is called the eternal; knowing the constant is called illumination. Truly knowing the constant Dao, one’s actions differ from the multitude. The noble person delights in attaining the Dao, while the petty person delights in attaining desires—their actions are as opposite as east and west.

Taking song as joy is meant to generate life, yet it leads to the loss of life. Before the joy is complete, sorrow follows. Taking the Dao as joy, joy gives life—how immeasurable is such joy! As *Zhuangzi* said: "What the world delights in—is there truly joy or not? Truly, non-action is joy, yet it is also what the world greatly suffers." The world is vast indeed, profoundly continuous, darkly chaotic and unknowable. Those who know it depart from it; those who desire it separate from it; those who approach it distance themselves from it.

There is a thing formed in chaos, named the Dao. Forcibly called "great," it has existed since ancient times, deep and subtle, beyond the reach of knowledge. Gazing at it, it seems before you; forgetting it, it seems behind. Those with a heart cannot attain it from afar; those without a heart can draw near. Vast and undifferentiated, one does not depart from it throughout life. If one claims to know it, one has already departed from it.

Thus the sage does not rely on the world, nor on ghosts and spirits, nor on the myriad things. He constantly takes emptiness as his body and non-being as his heart. These two are called the body without body and the heart without heart—this is called guarding the spirit.

Guard the spirit to attain mysterious penetration—this is called unity with the Dao.

There is the Great Thing: it cannot be treated as a thing. Treating it as no-thing, it can thus govern all things. He who understands that the governor of things is itself no-thing—how could his governance be limited to the world alone? Taking emptiness as his body and non-being as his heart, he clings to nothing—this is called being no-thing. Forgetting both body and heart, he guards only the spirit. Guarding it without loss, he becomes one with the spirit, and the Dao will then dwell with him, merging into the Great Unity.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: No-Thought**
Lord Lao said: The wise man has no thoughts that shift, ever empty, tranquil, and still. Cultivating his form, the myriad things are nurtured. Why should the world think or deliberate? The great sage observes both far and near, viewing the world through the world—empty, still, serene, and inactive—to preserve his form and life. Thus his spirit flows in all four directions, streaming upward and downward, coiling through and nurturing the myriad things, yet leaving no trace. Those who change seek the world’s treasures to gratify their desires. Then weapons arise on all sides, and calamity grows within. When the state is in turmoil, the people are weary and exhausted.

The *Dao Jing* says: Do not prize rare goods, so the people will not steal.
Zhuangzi says: Smash jade and destroy pearls, and petty thieves will not arise.
The state takes the people as its root; when the people labor and depart, the state stands ruined. This is like bringing forth treasures of boundless value, only to invite the sharp axes of bandits. Thus the sage practices non-action and avoids affairs, desiring to pacify his state and people. The people are the state’s root; when the root is firm, the state is at peace. Not knowing how to extend what they love to what they do not love, they fight over land, filling the fields with the slain; they fight over cities, filling the walls with the dead. This is like bringing forth treasures of boundless value, only to invite the sharp axes of bandits.

The sage practices non-action, and the people transform themselves; he avoids affairs, and the people enrich themselves. How could he strive to kill the people or seize others’ lands? Thus it is said: If you can know the One, all matters are complete. When virtue remains without intent, even ghosts and spirits submit. Knowing the One, there is nothing unknown; not knowing the One, there is nothing known. Virtue is attainment—penetrating the One and attaining it, for the heart is without intent. All matters arise from the One; the numinous power of ghosts and spirits also arises from our own heart. The heart without heart can assist the spirit, so neither harms the other, and virtue converges in exchange.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: My Life**
Lord Lao said: My life is in my own hands, not subject to Heaven and Earth. Fortune and misfortune are sought by none but oneself. If I do not see, hear, or know, the spirit does not leave the body, and I endure as long as the Dao. Eyes see nothing, ears hear nothing, the heart knows nothing—then your spirit will guard your form, and your form will attain long life. I share with Heaven and Earth a single qi to govern, guarding my own root. The world is pervaded by a single qi—self-originating, self-rooted, existing since ancient times. Knowing how to guard it, there is nothing that cannot be governed.

Liezi says: Heaven and Earth and I are born together as one kind.
Not imitating the crowd in practicing goodness, not acting with benevolence, loyalty, or trust, not behaving with reverence, not indulging in desires—yet the myriad things come to benefit. Practicing goodness without seeking fame, one is upright yet does not consider it righteousness; loving others yet does not consider it benevolence; being sincere yet does not consider it loyalty; being proper yet does not consider it trust. Reverent within, reaching others, loving universally without partiality, benefiting the myriad things without exception—this is not a matter of intent. Ever tranquil and inactive, the great Dao returns. Thus the spirit-man has no brilliance, the sage has no fame. Empty, still, serene, and inactive—this is the perfection of virtue, so the sage rests in it. The ancients preserved their light without revealing it, concealed their fame without displaying it, entering the numinous and penetrating the sagely—all embodying this principle.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: On Arms**
Lord Lao said: Arms are the world’s most inauspicious affair, not the state’s treasure. Those who treasure them do not use them; those who use them risk losing their state and people. Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the state’s treasure. Yet Heaven generates the five materials, and none can be lacking. Though they are treasured, how can one refrain from using them? Not understanding this and delighting in killing, favoring attack and war—how can this be the way of the people’s parents?

The *Annals* say: Reckless warfare has no glory.
Thus the sage embraces subtlety and holds to simplicity, not daring to contend with the world. Though fierce beasts may be present, they cannot seize him; though wasps, scorpions, and snakes may be present, they cannot sting him; though blades may be present, they cannot harm him. Through accumulating virtue and mysterious penetration, the world cannot harm him. The Dao is ever inactive yet accomplishes all; how could the sage who embodies the Dao act? Not contending with things, the world cannot contend with him. This has no other cause: accumulating goodness to perfect virtue, spiritual clarity is naturally attained. Thus he guides things without breaking them. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger has nowhere to place its claws, the blade has nowhere to lodge its edge—so nothing can harm him.

Zhuangzi says: If one can empty oneself and wander through the world, who can harm him?

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Softness and Weakness**
Lord Lao said: In the world, nothing is softer or weaker than qi; nothing is softer or weaker than the Dao. The Dao’s softness and weakness encompass Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things. From softness comes hardness, from weakness comes strength—yet the world does not know the root from which they arise. Qi is emptiness awaiting things. Qi begins at the Great Beginning, but the Dao exists before the Supreme Ultimate—thus qi originates from the Dao.

Weakness is the function of the Dao. From Heaven and Earth to the myriad things, all originate from this. There is life, yet none see its root; there is emergence, yet none see its gate. Thus, being arises from non-being as its mother, non-being arises from emptiness as its mother, and emptiness arises from the Dao as its mother. Spontaneity is the root of the Dao.

Non-movement does not generate non-being, yet from non-being arises being. Being does not depart from non-being; non-being becomes manifest through being. Though being and non-being differ in function, both are one with emptiness. Emptiness is not nothingness—it is merely without substance. The origin of emptiness and nothingness is wondrously realized by the Dao. Though the three differ in name, all arise from spontaneity. The term "mother" is but a metaphor.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The People**
Lord Lao said: The reason people treat life lightly and die prematurely is that they bring it upon themselves. It is not Heaven and Earth that destroy them, nor ghosts and spirits that harm them—it is because they possess knowledge and their forms are in motion. Misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate; they are summoned by people themselves.

Those who lose their forms do so through movement and transgression. Thus, failing to complete their natural lifespan and dying midway is not because Heaven and Earth or ghosts and spirits destroy or harm them—it is that people bring it upon themselves. As the *Book* says: "Heaven-made calamity may yet be avoided; self-made calamity cannot be escaped." This is what it means.

Therefore, from non-being arises being, from formlessness arises form—how much more so for completing affairs only to ruin them! Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Heaven bestows, Earth gives birth, their covering knows no bounds. They complete the myriad things without omission—how could they willingly ruin their own accomplishments?

Thus, when people treat life lightly and die prematurely, it is not yin and yang that harm them—it is the heart that causes it. If one desires longevity, one must sever emotions and abandon desires, purify the heart and still the mind, so that life may return to its origin. When form and spirit unite as one, they can endure long.

Heaven and Earth endure long, yet people cannot—because they indulge their emotions, indulge their desires, let their hearts wander, and their minds roam, bringing calamity upon themselves. If one can truly forget what should not be forgotten and turn inward to seek within oneself, then the form will live without decay, the spirit will remain whole without loss, form and spirit will unite without separation, and one will equal Heaven and Earth in longevity—this is not difficult.

**Chapter Thirty: The World**
Lord Lao said: Though one dwells in the world, let the mind not dwell in the world. Though one dwells in the state, let the mind not dwell in the state. Though one dwells in the village, let the mind not dwell in the village. Though one dwells in the household, let the mind not dwell in the household. Though the spirit dwells in the body, let the spirit not dwell in the body—this is called the person of the Dao.

In human life, the form does not fill a fathom, yet the heart accompanies creation—how could one be bound by the body or confined to a corner? One should forget the world entirely and lodge in inevitability. Viewing the state through the state, viewing the village through the village, viewing the household through the household—it is no different.

The ancients dwelled in their households as if in a temporary inn, viewed their villages as if they were barbarian lands—this is the essence. As for the spirit within a person: it traverses Mount Tai without obstruction, enters deep springs without getting wet, abides in lowliness without exhaustion, fills Heaven and Earth, extends to the eight directions, wondrously transforms the myriad things without fixed form, and is never burdened by the seven-foot body.

The deluded cling to selfishness, clinging to what fills a fathom in hopes of exhausting the spirit—how is this different from guarding the remnants of a ruined marketplace and expecting to gain from it?

**Chapter Thirty-One: Subtlety of Mind**
Lord Lao said: Disaster arises from the unexpected; calamity arises from the finest threads. Misfortune often hides in the hidden and subtle, emerging where people are heedless. The sage guards against the subtle and is cautious at the beginning, applying wisdom before things spiral out of control—this is why.

Good arises from evil, benefit arises from harm. There is good, and evil follows as its counterpart; there is benefit, and harm stands as its opposite. Nothing is exempt from this. Only by abandoning good to become good can good and evil become one. Thus, if one seeks to simplify and cannot attain the finest benefit, benefiting the world without speaking of benefit, then there will be nothing that is not beneficial, and harm will never arise.

Greatness arises from smallness, difficulty arises from ease. When beginnings are simple, their outcomes will be vast. Greatness arises from smallness—if one takes it lightly, difficulty will come. Difficulty arises from ease.

As the *Dejing* says: "The great affairs of the world always begin with the small; the difficult affairs of the world always begin with the easy."

Height arises from lowliness, distance arises from nearness. Height must be based on lowliness; distance must begin with nearness. Thus, a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth; a thousand-mile journey begins with a single step.

The external arises from the internal. What is within will inevitably manifest without.

Nobility arises from humility, movement arises from stillness. Nobility takes humility as its root; stillness is the foundation of movement.

Flourishing arises from decline. Without winter’s closure, there would be no spring’s luxuriance.

Yin arises from yang. If yang does not reach its extreme, yin will not arise.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other; emptiness and fullness complete each other. Therefore, being returns to being, non-being returns to non-being. From non-being emerges being; when being reaches its limit, it returns to non-being—this is their mutual generation. From emptiness comes fullness; fullness returns to emptiness—this is their mutual completion.

From good and evil to yin and yang, none escape this principle. Yet being and non-being alternate in function, responding to their kind. Where there is good, there is evil; being returns to being. Where there is no benefit, there is no harm; non-being returns to non-being. Each reflects its nature like an echo or shadow.

Thus, the one who embodies the Dao is not blinded by being nor drowned in non-being but stands firm in the center.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Abiding in the Dao**
Lord Lao said: People are within the Dao, and the Dao is within people. Fish are within water, and water is within fish. If the Dao departs, people die; if water dries up, fish perish.

The Dao is present everywhere. The myriad things thrive—how could they not follow this Dao? How much more so for people!

**From the *Zhuangzi*:**
The Dao moves through the myriad things, yet the Dao does not distance itself from people—people distance themselves from the Dao. It is like fish in water: if fish lose water, they die; if people lose the Dao, how can they endure? Thus, the sage, knowing this, returns to the state before birth, casting off arrogance and extravagance, severing anxiety and care. Therefore, the body withdraws while the spirit remains, and all under heaven turn to him. The sage, through self-awareness, roams in the origin of things, gazing outward to see no things, gazing inward to find no mind. Arrogance and care, inner and outer, are both forgotten. Thus, refining qi to perfect form, refining spirit to merge with the Dao, he does not seek the people’s allegiance—yet they naturally return.

**From the *Daoist Scripture*:**
Grasp the great image, and all under heaven will come. Practice non-action, refrain from meddling, and the state will flourish while the people grow rich. Preserve the Dao and store constancy—this is called profound unity. I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I refrain from meddling, and the people enrich themselves. Thus, returning to the deepest mystery, they attain oneness and unity. The true constancy of the Dao is no different from this.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Ruling a State**
Lord Lao said: Those who rule a state must have roots deep and unfathomable. Only then can they possess a state. The mother of the state ensures its longevity. Heaven and earth cover and bear all things, nurturing the myriad beings. Yet gold and jade, treasured wealth, are not hoarded. Heaven does not withhold its Dao; earth does not begrudge its treasures. Beyond heaven and earth, there is still heaven and earth. The great completeness of the Dao gives birth to heaven and earth—yet beyond heaven and earth, there exists a greater heaven and earth. If one truly knows that heaven and earth are born alongside me and transcends them, then though heaven and earth are vast, they do not lie beyond the measure of my understanding. One who transcends the self preserves life and longevity. Transcending life and death, forsaking fortune and misfortune, the spirit is never constrained. Thus, it merges with heaven and earth, and none can fathom its limits.

**From the *Daoist Scripture*:**
Transcend the self, and the self endures.

Therefore, the noble person finds goodness in what others deem unworthy. What others shun, I too deem good. He delights in what others do not. Gain brings joy, loss brings sorrow—this is the common nature of people. Yet the noble person is untroubled by loss or gain, for his joy lies in the Dao. What cause for sorrow is there? Thus, what brings him joy never ceases. He finds joy in what others find joyless. Heaven delights in heaven; the sage delights in sageliness. **From the *Zhuangzi*:**
*"I find true joy in non-action—though the world deems it the greatest suffering."*

He does what others do not. He seeks what others do not attain, cultivates what others do not practice. He trusts what others do not believe. The utterly trustworthy can move things—Shang Qiu Kai’s sincerity even fooled inanimate objects, let alone when both self and other are genuine. He walks paths others do not tread. Thus, his virtue is complete. To walk is to traverse what one cannot traverse. As for the above, all are things people cannot do, yet the noble person accomplishes them. Thus, accumulating goodness perfects virtue, and virtue merges with the Dao, so that both virtue and the Dao are fully realized.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: All Things Possess It**
Lord Lao said: The Dao does not reside in me alone—all things possess it. The myriad things do not know this; the Dao naturally abides in them. The Dao is present everywhere; all things share in its course. How could only the wise possess it? Even tiles and broken stones partake of it. The Dao moves through the myriad things, yet things do not know it. The Dao does not oppose things—things oppose the Dao themselves. All people are born by spirit, yet do not know that spirit gives them life. When a ruler bestows virtue upon the people, the people do not know they receive the ruler’s virtue. The spirit’s wondrous workings give rise to words, and things are born through it. Yet the people use it daily without awareness, just as they receive the ruler’s virtue without knowing it. They say, *"It is natural—what has the power of heaven to do with me?"*

Thus, the sage conceals spirit within, and the *po* does not stray. Guarding the mother preserves the child; the people flourish, and the state is secured. Profound emptiness accumulates and fills, receiving the mandate to endure.

**From the *Daoist Scripture*:**
*"Bearing the *po*."*

The *hun* is yang and moves; the *po* is yin and rests. The sage governs qi with spirit, controls the *po* with the *hun*. Thus, spirit always bears the *po* without being bound by it—how could it stray or depart? Spirit is the mother of qi; qi is the child of spirit. Guarding the mother preserves the child—this is the natural principle. It is like the people: the people are the foundation of the state. When the foundation is firm, the state is at peace. Qi is the origin of life. When qi is whole, life endures.

**From the *Scripture*:**
*"Attain the subtle transformation of qi."*

**From the *Zhuangzi*:**
*"Qi is that which is empty and awaits things."*

The primal emptiness of qi aligns with righteousness and the Dao, filling the four limbs. Without it, one grows weak. When the primal emptiness pervades the body, one’s lifespan rivals heaven and earth, enduring without end—this is not difficult to achieve. People strive to know heaven, earth, and the myriad things, yet do not know the source of their own existence. To return to life’s origin is the greatest ignorance. Within the span of one’s allotted years, nothing is not the root; beyond it, all is but the branch. The people of the world chase the branch and forget the root, exhausting their spirit in trivial pursuits. Though they may comprehend the vastness of heaven and earth and the multitude of things through thought, they cannot turn inward to know themselves. The Dao is near, yet they seek it afar. All claim to know—this is the greatest ignorance.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Cultivating the Self**
Lord Lao said: The way to cultivate the self begins with concealing heaven and earth, dwelling in stillness at the origin of the myriad things. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. *"Concealing heaven and earth"* does not mean hiding the body from sight, but deeply rooting and stabilizing it in this. The origin of the myriad things is the origin of heaven and earth. *"Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth"*—one who can return to the root and abide in it will find no difficulty in cultivating the self.

Hun Yuan addressed Confucius, saying: "My wandering in the origin of things—this is precisely the meaning. The sage penetrates the Primordial Mystery, preserving the body through blended qi and contemplation. The Celestial One resides in the storehouse, relying on primordial qi to establish the beginning; the Celestial Five dwells in the treasury, relying on harmonious qi to complete the end. Some are clear and swift, others turbid and slow—they circulate throughout the body, becoming the root of all life. This is qi: subtle yet hard to name, blended yet indivisible. Only the sage can comprehend it; having comprehended it, he can then preserve it. Without knowing how to nurture and sustain it, what was once full may now grow weak, what was once pure may now scatter. To preserve it without loss becomes impossible.

Guan Yin said of the perfected person: 'He moves in concealment without obstruction, treads fire without heat, walks above the myriad things without fear.' Is this not the preservation of pure qi? Does he not attain this?"

The common person preserves the body through emotional attachments and desires. Though both employ something to preserve the body, their virtue and power differ. What is not preserved? The preservation of the body is the root of preservation. Yet if what is preserved lies in the Dao, it is preserved without loss; if what is preserved is delusion, nothing can be preserved.

Embracing the primordial and concentrating qi—this is communion with the Dao. The Dao is never exhausted, while emotional attachments and covetous desires pursue delusion. How can they be long preserved? Though both employ something to preserve the body, how far apart are these things? For qi is empty and awaits things, yet when it merges with the primordial darkness, it becomes thing yet not thing. Thing yet not thing—this is the thing beyond things. Only the uniquely wise can understand this.

Through unique wisdom, one enters the gate of sageliness; through emotional desires, one enters the gate of the beasts. Their preservation of the body is the same, but what they preserve differs.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: Virtue and Power**
Lord Lao said: Virtue and power, heaven and earth, water and fire, the myriad things, towering mountains and deep abysses—each has its place of return. From the Dao they descend, falling into the realm of forms. Heaven is high, earth is low, the myriad things scatter and diverge. From form to formlessness, from sentience to insentience, teeming and bustling, each follows its kind—this is the principle of nature.

The Dao does not desire emptiness, yet emptiness naturally returns to it. Only the Dao gathers emptiness. Virtue does not seek the numinous, yet the numinous naturally returns to it. Accumulating goodness becomes virtue, and the numinous clarity is naturally attained. *The Book of Changes* says: "Manifesting the Dao, the numinous power of virtue acts."

Heaven does not desire clarity, yet clarity naturally returns to it; earth does not desire turbidity, yet turbidity naturally returns to it. The clear and light rises to become heaven; the turbid and heavy sinks to become earth. Dampness does not desire water, yet water naturally returns to it; dryness does not desire fire, yet fire naturally returns to it. Water flows toward dampness; fire moves toward dryness. The myriad things do not desire to manifest form, yet form naturally manifests. Movement endures and gives birth to things; when things take shape and life arises, this is called form. Once a thing exists, it cannot escape the burden of form.

Towering mountains and vast marshes do not desire birds and tigers, yet birds and tigers naturally come to them; deep abysses and rivers do not desire fish, turtles, and dragons, yet fish, turtles, and dragons naturally come to them. Piling up earth forms mountains, and beasts gather there; accumulating water forms abysses, and fish and turtles thrive there. *Zhuangzi* said: "Born in water and at ease in water, born on hills and at ease on hills."

If a person can be empty, tranquil, and non-active, though they do not desire the Dao, the Dao naturally returns to them. From this, we see: is not the nature of things spontaneous?

The Dao is ever non-active. Reduce and observe again, until you reach non-action, and the Dao will reside with you. *The Plain Questions* says: "Empty, primordial, tranquil, and indifferent—true qi follows this."

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Good and Evil**
Lord Lao said: When the common people do good, I do not know it; when they do evil, I do not know it; when they act with loyalty and trustworthiness, I do not know it. Thus, accumulating good brings good qi; accumulating evil brings evil qi.

The sage has no constant heart but takes the hearts of the people as his heart. Forgetting both good and evil, he leaves things to their natural course. Those who are not good, he also deems good; those who are not trustworthy, he also deems trustworthy. Good and evil, truth and falsehood merge into one governance—how can he choose between them? Why would he cling to distinctions and strive to know?

Yet, observing footsteps and examining omens, accumulating good and evil, misfortune and blessing each follow their kind, responding like echoes and shadows—it all depends on what people do.

Therefore, the sage says: I cherish the beginning of all under heaven and again preserve the mother of all under heaven, so that the myriad things revere me and I enliven my body. The beginning of all under heaven is the nameless origin of heaven and earth; the mother of all under heaven is the named mother of the myriad things. These two have different names but are together called the Dao.

Where the Dao resides, the myriad things revere it. To preserve the body—what could be more excellent? As *Zhuangzi* said: "The utmost joy enlivens the body—only non-action and observation remain."

Though the sage of Hun Yuan does not claim sageliness for himself, he takes the words of the sages as evidence—this is why his sageliness becomes ever more sagely.

My mind is often without knowledge—how can I know whether others do good or evil? Knowing is shallow; not knowing is deep. Knowing is external; not knowing is internal. Thus, not knowing is true knowing, and knowing is not knowing. Therefore, not knowing others but knowing oneself—is this not the essence of great wisdom?

Accumulating good, the numinous assists in completion; the way of heaven aids the good person. Accumulating good without cease, the spirits hear it. With this, great blessings come, and heaven protects you—auspiciousness without fail. *The Classic of Virtue* says: "The way of heaven shows no partiality; it constantly accompanies the good person."

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Tranquil Intent**
Lord Lao said: My Dao is bland and tranquil. Intent dies, and life is born—stillness returns to the mandate.

The bland does not contend with things; the tranquil remains still and does not flow—this is the truth of the Dao. Those who embody the Dao resemble withered wood in form and dead ashes in heart, inwardly stilling their intent to return to tranquil concentration. They do not cling to life as something to be grasped, and thus, by not seeking to preserve themselves, their forms live without decay—all returning to the constancy of the mandate.

Life arises through gradual accumulation and permeation, moistening and lingering, its mysterious covering suffusing all, the primordial *qi* enveloping it, its roots deeply embedded. Thus firmly established on all four sides, with emptiness at the center, it attracts the essence of the myriad things. The boundless comes to it of its own accord, for it is empty and desireless. What is born of life dies, yet that which gives life never ends—what gives life is the Dao. To awaken to the Dao is sudden, a single breath and the spirit is present; to practice the Dao is gradual, requiring true accumulation and enduring effort.

If one can accumulate without cease, permeating and maturing, then essence is preserved and spirit flourishes. The kidney-water moistens, and the two *qi* nourish; the jade spring and numinous blossom circulate unimpeded—how could there be any obstruction? Thus, the wondrous *qi* of the celestial One blankets the body, the divine fluid flows smoothly, irrigating the five organs, four limbs, and hundred parts. The primordial *qi* encompasses all, roots deep and stem firm, the heart empty and the abdomen full. The essence of the myriad things arrives unbidden.

The ancients who could "embrace the *qi* of heaven and transmit the spirit" attained this. **Chapter Thirty-Nine: Admonitions**
Lord Lao said: Listen well, for I tell you again: the ancients who first attained this were my own body. Now I shall return my spirit to the nameless. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; returning to the nameless is what is called wandering in the Great Beginning. Sever the self and extinguish being, yet it endures unbroken. Cast the self aside, and the self is preserved.

Now I depart, returning to the One Origin. The Great Beginning holds the realm of being and non-being; non-being holds the nameless. The origin of the One is the origin of the One—this is the prior state of the Great Beginning. Before the Great Beginning, it cannot be grasped. Returning to this, the body exhausts the boundless and wanders without reflection—this is what is meant by ruling with the Great One. The Great One is the origin of the One.

Confucius said to Hunyuan: "Just now, Master, your form stood like withered wood, as if you had forgotten things and left humanity behind, standing alone. Did you perceive this?" Suddenly, he vanished. In an instant, the lodging blazed with light, and five colors—mysterious and yellow—appeared. Xi came out into the courtyard, kowtowed, and said: "I wish the divine one would appear once more and bestow a single essential teaching, that I might preserve the primordial."

Then he looked up and saw him suspended in midair, seated, tens of feet above the ground. His form was like a golden man, his presence and absence indistinct, old and young without constancy. The sage encompasses all in one body, his form filling emptiness, and thus his spirit is wondrous and unfathomable. His presence and absence are free, his transformations swift and indescribable.

Lord Lao said: "I admonish you again—guard this well. Eliminate defilements, still your thoughts, and guard the One with a tranquil heart. When all defilements are removed, all affairs are complete—this is the essential teaching of my Dao." Then he truly vanished again. Xi, not knowing where he had gone, wept and longed for him, resigned his office on grounds of illness, abandoned all thoughts, and guarded the One. Thus, all affairs were complete.

The *Tradition* says: "Through the One, all affairs are complete." What is the One? It is the essence of the number. Heaven attains it and is clear; earth attains it and is tranquil; the myriad things attain it and live. If one can guard it without losing it, one returns to the utmost essence of the world. Yet if defiled thoughts are not forgotten, even if one wishes to guard it, it cannot be grasped.

Cast off all burdens, let not even a hair’s weight cling to you. Let no false thoughts arise, and the numinous terrace will be upheld—bright as a mirror, unstained by dust. If you can embrace this without letting go, all the world’s tasks are complete. This is why the sage values essence.

Formerly, Guangchengzi cultivated himself for twelve hundred years, yet his form never declined—he had attained this. Hunyuan said to Nanrong Yue: "The classic of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it?" This is precisely the same teaching.
