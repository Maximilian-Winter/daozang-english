**Chapter 1 (59 words):**
That which can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.
That which can be named is not the eternal Name.
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.
The Named is the mother of all things.
Thus, the eternal Nameless—
We seek to observe its subtlety.
The eternal Named—
We seek to observe its limits.
These two emerge together yet differ in name.
Though called by different names, they are one.
This oneness we call the Mysterious.
The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—
The gateway through which all wonders pass.

---

**Chapter 2 (93 words):**
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
then ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness,
then wickedness arises.
Thus, being and non-being produce each other,
difficulty and ease give rise to one another,
long and short define each other,
high and low contrast each other,
sound and voice harmonize,
before and after follow in sequence.
Therefore, the Sage acts without action,
teaches without speech.
All things arise yet he does not initiate them;
they grow yet he does not possess them;
he acts yet does not rely on them;
his work is done yet he does not dwell upon it.
Because he does not dwell upon it,
he is never forsaken.

---

**Chapter 3 (68 words):**
Do not exalt the worthy,
so the people will not compete.
Do not treasure rare and costly goods,
so the people will not steal.
Do not display what is desirable,
so the people’s hearts will not be disordered.
Thus, the Sage governs by:
Emptying their minds,
filling their bellies,
weakening their ambitions,
strengthening their bones,
ever ensuring the people have no knowledge, no desires.
When the clever dare not act,
and action is without purpose,
then all things are done without interference.

---

**Chapter 4 (42 words):**
The Dao is vast,
yet its use is never exhausted.
Deep, it seems the ancestor of all things.
It blunts the sharp,
untangles the tangled,
dimms the gleaming,
harmonizes the dusty.
Mysterious, it seems to exist yet not.
I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the Sovereign.

---

**Chapter 5 (45 words):**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;
they treat all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not benevolent;
he treats the people as straw dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet never exhausted,
moving yet never worn out.
Much speech leads to exhaustion;
better to guard the center.

---

**Chapter 6 (26 words):**
The Valley Spirit never dies—
this is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female—
this is the root of Heaven and Earth.
Endless, as if present,
its use is inexhaustible.

---

**Chapter 7 (49 words):**
Heaven is long, Earth is enduring.
Why do Heaven and Earth endure so long?
Because they do not live for themselves—
thus they can endure.
Therefore, the Sage puts himself last,
yet he is first.
He discards himself,
yet he is preserved.
Not because he seeks the private,
he achieves the private.

---

**Chapter 8 (52 words):**
The highest excellence resembles water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend.
It dwells where others disdain to be,
thus it is close to the Dao.
Dwelling is beneficial to the land.
Mind is beneficial as a depth.
Giving is beneficial to others.
Speech is beneficial in trustworthiness.
Governance is beneficial in order.
Actions are beneficial in capability.
Movement is beneficial in timing.
Thus, only by not contending
does one avoid blame.

---

**Chapter 9 (41 words):**
To hold and fill is not as good as stopping in time.
Measure with a vessel, yet it is easily broken—
how can it endure?
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.
Rich and noble yet arrogant—
they bring ruin upon themselves.
When fame is achieved and work is complete,
withdraw—this is the Way of Heaven.

---

**Chapter 10 (72 words):**
Nurturing the vital essence—
can one fail to preserve it?
Concentrating the qi to attain softness—
can one resemble an infant?
Purifying and preserving the Mysterious—
can one avoid blemish?
Loving the people, governing the state—
can one act without knowledge?
Opening and closing the Heavenly Gate—
can one be receptive?
Illuminated and all-pervading—
can one avoid excess?
Nourishing yet not possessing,
acting yet not relying,
nurturing yet not dominating—
this is called the Mysterious Virtue.

---

**Chapter 11 (49 words):**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
yet it is the empty space that makes the wheel useful.
Clay is shaped into vessels,
yet it is the empty space that makes them useful.
Doors and windows are carved for rooms,
yet it is the empty space that makes them useful.
Thus, what has is for advantage,
what is empty is for use.

---
**Chapter 12 (49 words):** *(Translation pending—please provide the full text for completion.)*

**Chapter 12 (49 words):**
The five hues blind the eyes,
The five tones deaf the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Swift hunting and coursing madden the mind,
Rare and costly goods disrupt conduct.
Thus, the Sage governs the belly, not the eyes,
And discards the one to take the other.
**Chapter 13 (88 words):**
Honor and disgrace are like sudden alarm—
What is called *great calamity* is like the body itself.
How does one honor and disgrace like sudden alarm?
Honor is lowly—
To gain it is like alarm,
To lose it is like alarm:
This is called *honor and disgrace like sudden alarm*.
How does one value *great calamity* like the body itself?
The reason I have great calamity
Is that I have a body—
If I had no body,
What calamity would I have?
Thus, one who values the body above all else
Can entrust himself to the world,
And one who loves the body above all else
Can commit himself to the world.

**Chapter 14 (100 words):**
What cannot be seen is called *level* (夷),
What cannot be heard is called *rare* (希),
What cannot be grasped is called *subtle* (微).
These three cannot be forced or interrogated,
So they merge into one.
One—
Its upper reaches are not bright,
Its lower depths are not dark,
Its measure is unnameable,
Returning to *non-being*.
This is called *the form of non-form*,
*The image of non-image*—
This is called *芴芒* (Wu-mang).
Approach it, you cannot see its head,
Follow it, you cannot see its tail.
Holding to the ancient Dao,
One can govern the present.
To know the ancient origins—
This is called *the record of the Dao*.

**Chapter 15 (98 words):**
Those anciently skilled in the Dao
Were subtle, mysterious, and far-reaching,
Deep as to be unknowable.
Since it cannot be known,
They forced it into form, saying:
*"Proceeding with caution, like crossing a river in winter,
Solemn, like fearing four neighbors,
Respectful, like a guest,
Dissolving, like ice about to melt,
Thick, like uncarved wood,
Vast, like a valley,
Mingled, like muddy water.
Who can clarify muddy water?
By stillness, it gradually clears.
Who can prolong stillness?
By motion, it gradually arises.
One who preserves this Dao does not seek fullness.
Since he does not seek fullness,
He can be exhausted yet remain unspent."*

**Chapter 16 (67 words):**
Attain utmost emptiness,
Hold steadfast to tranquility.
All things arise together,
And I observe their return.
Each thing returns to its root—
Returning to root is called *tranquility*,
*Tranquility* is called *restoring life*,
*Restoring life* is called *constancy*,
Knowing *constancy* is called *clarity*.
Ignorance of *constancy* leads to reckless action—
This is ruinous.
Knowing *constancy*,
One is tolerant,
Tolerance brings fairness,
Fairness brings kingship,
Kingship aligns with Heaven,
Heaven aligns with the Dao,
The Dao endures eternally,
And one’s life will not be cut short.

**Chapter 17 (47 words):**
The *Supreme Sage* (太上) is known below only as *having*.
The next level, the people *love* him.
The next level, the people *praise* him.
The next level, the people *fear* him.
The next level, the people *despise* him.
Thus, when trust is insufficient,
How can there be no distrust?
How precious are these words!
When affairs are accomplished,
The people say: *"It happened naturally."*

**Chapter 18 (28 words):**
When the *Great Dao* is neglected,
There arise *benevolence and righteousness*.
When *wisdom and insight* emerge,
There arises *great deceit*.
When the *six bonds of kinship* are discordant,
There arise *filial piety and affection*.
When the state is in chaos,
There arise *faithful and upright ministers*.

**Chapter 19 (47 words):**
To abandon *sagehood* and discard *knowledge*,
The people gain a hundredfold.
To abandon *benevolence* and discard *righteousness*,
The people return to *filial piety and affection*.
To abandon *craftiness* and discard *profit*,
There are no thieves or robbers.
These three are insufficient for *culture*,
Yet they must be allowed to exist.
To see the *plain and simple*,
To have few desires and little self-interest—

**Chapter 20 (137 words):**
To abandon learning, there is no anxiety.
How far apart are *"yes"* and *"no"*?
How different are *"beauty"* and *"evil"*?
What the people fear,
Cannot be unfounded in fear.
Vast and unending—
The people rejoice as if feasting on the grandest sacrifices,
As if ascending to the spring platform,
While I alone am somber,
My signs not yet revealed,
Like an infant before its first cry,
Frail and weak—
Yet not enough to be without direction.
The people all have excess,
While I alone seem abandoned—
My heart is that of the simple fool.
Dim and indistinct—
The people are all bright and clear,
While I alone seem benighted.
The people are all keen and discerning,
While I alone seem dull and confused.
Faint and drifting, like the sea,
Light as if without end—
The people all have their ways,
While I alone am stubborn and confused.
I alone wish to differ from others,
And value *the Mother* (食母) above all.

**Chapter 21 (71 words):**
The *great virtue* takes form in the Dao alone.
The Dao, as a thing,
Is only *芴* (wu) and *芒* (mang).
*芴* and *芒*—
Within them is *image*,
Within them is *substance*.
Dark and obscure—
Within them is *essence*.
Its essence is most true,
Within it is *faith*.
From ancient to today,
Its name never fades—
To observe all things.
How do I know all things are thus?
By this.

**Chapter 22 (78 words):**
The *plain and simple* (素袌朴) take form in the Dao alone.
The Dao, as a thing,
Is only *芴* (wu) and *芒* (mang).
*芴* and *芒*—
Within them is *image*,
Within them is *substance*.
Dark and obscure—
Within them is *essence*.
Its essence is most true,
Within it is *faith*.
From ancient to today,
Its name never fades—
To observe all things.
How do I know all things are thus?
By this.

**Chapter 21 (71 words):**
The *great virtue* takes form in the Dao alone.
The Dao, as a thing,

*芴* and *芒*—
Within them is *image*,
Within them is *substance*.
Dark and obscure—
Within them is *essence*.
Its essence is most true,
Within it is *faith*.
From ancient to today,
Its name never fades—
To observe all things.
How do I know all things are thus?
By this.

**Chapter 22 (78 words):**

*芴* and *芒*—

Within them is *substance*.
Dark and obscure—

Its essence is most true,
Within it is *faith*.
From ancient to today,

To observe all things.

By this.

**Chapter 23 (92 words):**
What is crooked becomes whole.
What is twisted becomes upright.
What is hollow becomes filled.
What is worn becomes new.
What is little becomes gained.
What is much becomes confused.
The sage *plain and simple* (素袌朴),
And sets the pattern for all under heaven.
He does not display himself,
Therefore he is bright.
He does not affirm himself,
Therefore he is illustrious.
He does not vaunt himself,
Therefore his merit endures.
He does not boast,
Therefore he grows.
Only he who does not contend
Is thus no one under heaven can contend with him.
The ancients said, *"What is crooked becomes whole,"*
Was it mere empty words?
Indeed it is whole and returns to its source.

---

**Chapter 24 (48 words):**
Few words come naturally,
So the gusting wind does not last a morning,
And sudden rain does not last a day.
Who does this?
It is heaven and earth.
Heaven and earth cannot endure long,
And much less can man.
Thus, those who follow the Dao
Are in harmony with the Dao.
Those who follow gain
Are in harmony with gain.
Those who follow loss
Are in harmony with loss.
In those who follow the Dao, the Dao is gained.
In those who follow gain, gain is gained.
In those who follow loss, loss is gained.
*Faith* is insufficient,
How can there be *unfaith*?

---

**Chapter 25 (87 words):**
He who strives to stand
Cannot stand.
He who strives to walk
Cannot go.
He who displays himself
Is not bright.
He who affirms himself
Is not illustrious.
He who vaunts himself
Has no merit.
He who boasts
Does not grow.
In the Dao, it is said:
*"I eat my fill and move with leisure."*
Things abhor it,
Therefore, those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.

---

**Chapter 26 (49 words):**
There is a thing that is *mixed and complete* (混成),
Born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void—
It stands alone and does not change,
It moves through all and never falters.
It may be called the mother of all under heaven.
I do not know its name,
So I forcefully name it the Dao,
And forcefully call it *great* (大).
*Great* means *passing* (逝),
*Passing* means *distant* (远),
*Distant* means *returning* (返).
The Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And man is also great.
Within the fourfold greatness,
The king occupies one place of honor.
Man follows earth,
Earth follows heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows *nature* (自然).

---

**Chapter 27 (97 words):**
Weighty is the root of lightness,
Calm is the master of agitation.
Therefore the sage moves all day
Without leaving his baggage behind.
Though he has palaces and feasts,
His dwelling is serene and detached.
How can he who commands ten thousand chariots
Lighten himself to bear the world?
Lightness leads to loss of roots,
Agitation leads to loss of mastery.

---

**Chapter 28 (85 words):**
He who knows the masculine
Guards the feminine,
Is a ravine for all under heaven.
As a ravine for all under heaven,
His virtue never departs,
And he returns to the infant.
He who knows the bright
Guards the dark,
Is a model for all under heaven.
As a model for all under heaven,
His virtue never errs,
And he returns to the boundless.
He who knows the honored
Guards the humiliated,
Is a valley for all under heaven.
As a valley for all under heaven,
His virtue is complete,
And he returns to the *primordial* (朴).
The *primordial* scatters and becomes vessels.
The sage uses them,
Thus becoming the ruler and official,
And the great measure knows no cutting.

---

**Chapter 29 (60 words):**
He who would take all under heaven and do so,
I have seen his failure.
For all under heaven is a *divine instrument* (神器),
Not to be forced.
To force it is to spoil it.
To grasp it is to lose it.
Things sometimes act or follow,
Sometimes are silent or loud,
Sometimes are strong or weak,
Sometimes rise or fall.
Therefore the sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids dominance.

---

**Chapter 30 (79 words):**
He who aids the ruler with the Dao
Does not use arms to force all under heaven.
His undertakings are simple,
And the troops return of their own accord.
Where the army has been,
There are years of hardship.
Thus the good man is content with his lot,
And does not dare to take more by force.
Content without arrogance,
Content without vaunting,
Content without pride,
Content without compulsion—
This is content without force.
When things grow strong, they grow old.
This is called *not the Dao*,
And *not the Dao* soon perishes.

---

**Chapter 31 (135 words):**
Fine arms are an *auspicious instrument* (不祥之器).
Things abhor them,
Therefore those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.
Thus the sage values the left when at home,
But values the right when using arms.
Arms are an *auspicious instrument*,
Not the instrument of the sage,
Used only when there is no alternative.
He who is tranquil and at ease is held in highest esteem,
Therefore arms are not prized.
If they are prized,
Men will delight in them.
He who delights in killing men
Cannot achieve his aims in all under heaven.
Thus auspicious undertakings favor the left,
Inauspicious undertakings favor the right.
Therefore the left general is in command,
And the right general is second.
Words of the left are advantageous,
And funeral expenses are placed on the right.
Many deaths bring sorrow and tears.
Victory in battle is treated as funeral rites.

---

**Chapter 32 (71 words):**
The Dao is always nameless.

The Dao is always plain and simple,
Yet none under heaven can subdue it.

If kings and lords can guard it well,
All things will come of their own accord.

Heaven and Earth unite,
And sweet dew descends.
The people do not command it,
Yet it is evenly distributed.

The Dao was first named.
Once named, the sage knows when to stop—
To stop is to avoid peril.
The Dao’s presence in the world
Is like that of streams and valleys to rivers and seas.

---

The one who knows others is wise,
The one who knows himself is clear-sighted.
The one who overcomes others is strong,
The one who masters himself is powerful.
The one who knows contentment is rich,
The one who acts with resolve has purpose.
The one who does not stray from his place endures,
The one who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.

---

The Dao flows vast and boundless,
Yet cannot be confined to left or right.
All things depend on it for life,
Yet it does not claim them—
Its work done, it does not dwell on it.
It clothes all things yet does not rule them,
So it always lacks desire,
And may be called *small*.
All things return to it,
Yet it does not know who their master is,
So it may be called *great*.
Thus the sage can achieve the Dao’s greatness,
Because he never considers himself great,
And so can achieve the Dao’s greatness.

---

Grasping the great symbol,
All under heaven will follow.
Following yet causing no harm,
One attains lasting peace and ease.
Delight and bait,
And the passing traveler will stop.
The Dao’s spoken words are bland,
Without flavor.

To look upon it is not to see,
To listen to it is not to hear,
To use it is never to exhaust.

---

When one would gather,
One must first let loose.
When one would weaken,
One must first let grow strong.
When one would ruin,
One must first let flourish.
When one would take away,
One must first give.
This is called *subtle luminosity*.
The yielding overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
Fish cannot be caught in the depths,
Nor can the state’s sharpest tools
Be shown to the people.

---

The Dao is ever without action,
Yet nothing is left undone.
If kings and lords can guard it well,
All things will transform of their own accord.
If they act to transform,
I will govern them with the uncarved simplicity of the Dao.
The uncarved simplicity of the Dao—
They will not desire it,
And without desire, they will be tranquil,
And all under heaven will be set aright.

---
*The Dao Classic, ancient text, concludes.*
*The Virtue Classic, ancient text, concludes.*

The highest virtue does not claim virtue,
And thus has virtue.
The lowest virtue clings to virtue,
And thus lacks virtue.
The highest virtue acts without action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
The lowest virtue acts and yet fails to achieve.
The virtuous act for virtue’s sake,
Yet still fail to achieve.
The righteous act for righteousness’ sake,
And thus achieve.
The ceremonial act for ceremony’s sake,
And when none respond,
They force it with arms and threats.
Thus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, ceremony arises.
Ceremony, the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust,
Is the beginning of chaos.
Pretense of foresight is the flower of the Way,
And the start of folly.
Thus, the true sage abides in substance, not in veneer,
In reality, not in ornament.
Therefore, abandon the latter and take the former.

---

In ancient times, those who attained the One:
Heaven gained the One and thus was clear.
Earth gained the One and thus was tranquil.
The Spirit gained the One and thus was numinous.
The Valley gained the One and thus was full.
All things gained the One and thus were born.
Rulers gained the One and thus became steadfast for all under heaven.
This is how the One is attained.
If Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear shattering.
If Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear upheaval.
If the Spirit lacked numinosity, it would fear cessation.
If the Valley lacked fullness, it would fear exhaustion.
If all things lacked birth, they would fear annihilation.
If rulers lacked steadfastness, and yet sought exaltation,
They would fear ruin.
Thus, the noble rests on the base of humility,
And the exalted rests on the foundation of lowliness.
Therefore, rulers call themselves "lonely and few,"
And "not worthy"—
This is their resting on humility,
Is it not?

Thus, when praise is sought, it is not praise.
Do not be dazzling like jade,
Nor cold like stone.

---

The turning of the Way is its movement,
The yielding of the Way is its power.
All things under heaven arise from Being,
Being arises from Non-Being.

---

The superior person hears the Way and strives to embody it.
The mediocre person hears the Way and holds it lightly, as if it might vanish.
The inferior person hears the Way and laughs in derision.
If it is not laughed at, it is not the Way.
Thus, the ancient saying goes:
The bright Way seems obscure,
The level Way seems uneven,
Advancing the Way seems like retreat.
The highest virtue is like a valley,
The greatest whiteness seems like darkness,
The broadest virtue seems insufficient,
Establishing virtue seems like theft,
True simplicity seems like loss.
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel is fashioned last,
The greatest music is soft in sound,
The greatest image has no form,
The Way is hidden and nameless.
Only the Way is good at lending itself out
And yet remains complete.

---

The Way gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to all things.
All things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang before them,
And through harmonious *qi* achieve balance.
What men most despise—
The lonely, the few, the unworthy—
Are the titles rulers take for themselves.
Thus, some things are diminished to benefit,
Others are increased to harm.
What men teach me,
I also teach to men.
The overbearing will not meet a proper end,
And I shall make them my teachers.

---

The softest thing under heaven
Overcomes the hardest thing under heaven.
What emerges from non-existence
Enters without gaps.
Thus, I know the benefit of non-action.
The teaching of silence,
The benefit of non-action—
Few under heaven attain them.

---

What is more intimate than name and body?
What is more abundant than body and wealth?
What is more painful than gain and loss?
Thus, those who love much must spend much.
Hoarding much will surely lead to great loss.
Knowing sufficiency brings no shame.
Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
This is how one endures.

---

Great completion seems incomplete,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness seems like a vessel with a flaw,
Yet its use is boundless.
The most upright seems crooked,
The most skillful seems clumsy,
The most eloquent seems tongue-tied.
Fervor overcomes cold,
Tranquility overcomes heat.
The sage knows to embrace tranquility
To set the world aright.

---

When the Way prevails under heaven,
Warhorses are driven to the fields.
When the Way does not prevail under heaven,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.
No sin is greater than desiring what is forbidden,
No calamity is greater than insatiability,
No blame is deeper than covetousness.
Thus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.

---

Without leaving one’s door,
One may know the world.
Without peering through windows,
One may know the Way of Heaven.
The farther one goes,
The less one knows.
Thus, the sage acts without going,
Names without seeing,
Accomplishes without doing.

---

The scholar’s learning increases daily,
The Daoist’s practice decreases daily.
Decrease and decrease again,
Until one reaches non-action.
Non-action, yet nothing remains undone.
He who would take the world
Must always do nothing.
When action arises,
He is unfit to take the world.

---

The sage has no fixed heart,
But takes the hearts of the people as his own.
The good, I treat well;
The not-good, I also treat well—
Thus, goodness is achieved.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
Thus, trust is achieved.
The sage appears in the world,
Yet seems to withdraw;
The world is muddled, yet he is clear.
All eyes and ears are fixed upon him,
Yet he sighs as if weary.

---

Birth and death—
Thirteen perish in birth,
Thirteen perish in death,
And of those who live,
Those who move toward death are also thirteen.
Why so?
Because life’s abundance is too great.
Truly, those who master life
Walk on land without meeting rhinoceros or tiger,
Enter battle without armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger no place to strike with its claws,
Weapons no place to lodge their blades.

「Why so? Because there is no place of death.
**Chapter 51, 72 words.**
The Dao gives birth to all things;
Virtue nurtures them.
Form is given to them by things;
Force completes them.
Thus, all things revere the Dao and honor virtue.
The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—
No one bestows them,
Yet they remain ever natural.
Hence, the Dao gives birth without possession,
Acts without claiming,
Grows without domination—
This is called the mysterious virtue.

**Chapter 52, 73 words.**
The world has its beginning,
And it can be called the mother of the world.
Having obtained its mother,
One may know its children.
Having known its children,
One returns to guard its mother—
And thus, through life, one meets no danger.
Close its openings,
Shut its doors,
And one will never grow weary in life.
Open its openings,
Aid its work,
And one will never be saved in life.
Seeing the small as bright is called insight;
Holding to the gentle as strength.
Using its radiance,
Yet returning to its brightness—
No harm befalls the body,
This is called the abiding norm.

**Chapter 53, 54 words.**
Let me speak plainly with knowledge,
And walk the Great Dao—
Only fear is my guide.
The Great Dao is most level,
Yet people love narrow paths.
Morning is most clear,
Yet fields grow overgrown,
Granaries grow empty.
Fine garments adorned,
Swords at their sides,
Sated with drink and food,
Yet wealth overflows.
This is called thieving display—
Thieving display is not the Dao!

**Chapter 54, 86 words.**
The well-built cannot be uprooted,
The well-wrapped cannot be unwound—
Thus, descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing.
Cultivate it in oneself,
And its virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family,
And its virtue overflows.
Cultivate it in the village,
And its virtue grows long.
Cultivate it in the state,
And its virtue becomes abundant.
Cultivate it in the world,
And its virtue becomes universal.
Hence, observe oneself through oneself,
Observe the family through the family,
Observe the village through the village,
Observe the state through the state,
Observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world’s nature?
By this.

**Chapter 55, 83 words.**
Those rich in virtue
Are like a newborn babe.
Wasps and hornets do not sting them,
Fierce beasts do not attack them,
Snatching birds do not clutch them.
Their bones are weak, their sinews soft,
Yet their grip is firm.
They do not know the union of male and female,
Yet their life is complete—
This is the utmost refinement.
They cry all day yet never lose their voice,
Nor grow hoarse from shouting—
This is the utmost harmony.
Knowing harmony is called constancy,
Knowing constancy is called insight.
Increasing life is called auspiciousness,
The heart guides the qi—
Then strength is achieved.
When things grow strong, they grow old,
This is called not following the Dao—
Not following the Dao brings early decline.

**Chapter 56, 70 words.**
The wise do not speak,
The speakers are not wise.
Close its openings,
Shut its doors,
Dull its sharpness,
Untangle its complications,
Harmonize its radiance,
Blend with its dust—
This is called the mysterious unity.
It cannot be approached or distanced,
Cannot be used for gain or harm,
Cannot be esteemed or belittled.
Thus, it is the world’s most noble.

**Chapter 57, 92 words.**
Govern with the Dao,
Wage war with subtlety,
Conquer the world without conflict.
How do I know the world’s nature?
By this.
The world is filled with taboos,
Yet the people grow more chaotic.
The people multiply sharp tools,
Yet the state grows more benighted.
The people grow more clever,
Yet contentious disputes multiply.
Laws and decrees grow more intricate,
Yet thieves and robbers abound.
Hence, the sage says:
I act without action,
Yet the people transform themselves.
I love tranquility,
Yet the people align themselves.
I act without strife,
Yet the people grow rich.
I desire nothing,
Yet the people return to simplicity.

**Chapter 58, 64 words.**
When governance is gentle and tender,
The people are simple and honest.
When governance is strict and scrutinizing,
The people grow cunning and evasive.
Disaster—
It depends upon fortune.
Fortune—
It hides within disaster.
Who knows their limits?
The unaligned do not know.
The aligned become strange,
The good become rare.
The people’s confusion has long been fixed.
Thus, the sage is square yet not rigid,
Chaste yet not piercing,
Upright yet not domineering,
Radiant yet not dazzling.

**Chapter 59, 60 words.**
To govern people and serve Heaven,
Nothing surpasses moderation.
Only moderation
Allows early service.
Early service is called accumulating virtue.
Accumulating virtue,
Then nothing is not overcome.
Nothing is not overcome,
Then no one knows its limits.
No one knows its limits,
Then one may have a state.
The mother of having a state,
May endure long.
This is called the Dao of deep roots and firm foundations,
Long life and lasting vision.

**Chapter 60, 49 words.**
To govern a great state,
As if cooking a small fish.
Those who rule the world with the Dao—
Their spirits are not numinous.
Not that their spirits are not numinous,
But that the numinous do not harm them.
Not that the numinous do not harm them,
But that the sage does not harm them.
When both do not harm each other,
Then virtue returns and dwells.»

**Chapter 61, 89 words.**
A great state is the world’s undercurrent,
The world’s confluence.
The world’s female—
The female always overcomes the male through tranquility,
For its tranquility, it is the undercurrent.
Thus, a great state yields to small states,
And takes from small states.
Small states yield to great states,
And take from great states.
Sometimes yielding to take,
Sometimes yielding while taking.
Great states seek only to nurture and shelter the people,
Small states seek only to serve the great.
Both attain what they desire,
Thus, the great should rightly yield.

**Chapter 62, 85 words.**
The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things,
The treasure of the good,
The safeguard of the not-good.
Fine words can be sold in the market,
Noble words can be bestowed upon others.
When people are not good,
What can they discard?
Thus, when establishing the Son of Heaven,
And appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,
Even if one offers a jade tablet with two handles
Or four horses in a row,
It is not as good as advancing this Dao.
Why did the ancients value this Dao so highly?

---

The Way is not spoken of as sought to obtain,
Nor is it used to avoid guilt.
Thus, it is rightly treasured by all under Heaven.

**Chapter 63, 85 words.**
Act without doing,
Work without effort,
Taste without savoring.
Great and small, many and few—
Repay resentment with virtue.
Confront difficulties when they are easy,
And act upon great matters when they are small.
The difficult tasks of the world
Must be achieved when they are easy.
The great undertakings of the world
Must be accomplished when they are minute.
Therefore, the Sage never acts upon greatness,
And thus is able to complete it.

He who lightly promises must be few in trust.
He who takes many things lightly must meet many difficulties.
Thus, the Sage finds difficulty in difficulty,
And so he never meets with difficulty.

**Chapter 64, 131 words.**
To hold firmly what is tranquil is easy,
To plan when it has not yet emerged is easy.
To break what is brittle is easy,
To disperse what is minute is easy.
To act when it has not yet arisen,
To govern when it has not yet become disordered—
This is the Way of the Sage.
The great tree grows from tiny shoots,
The nine-layered terrace rises from piled earth,
The thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet.
To act and then ruin it,
To grasp and then lose it—
Therefore, the Sage does nothing and so meets no ruin,
Does not grasp and so loses nothing.
The people often fail when their task is nearly complete.
If one is cautious at the end as at the beginning,
There will be no ruin in undertakings.
Thus, the Sage desires without desiring,
Does not prize goods that are hard to obtain.
He teaches without teaching,
To return the people to their errors.
He aids the natural course of all things,
Yet does not dare to act.

**Chapter 65, 74 words.**
The ancients who excelled in the Way
Did not enlighten the people,
But rather sought to bewilder them.
The people are hard to govern
Because they have too much knowledge.
Thus, to govern with knowledge is to harm the state,
To govern without knowledge is to benefit the state.
Always knowing these two principles
Is to grasp the standard.
To grasp the standard is called the profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and distant,
Opposed to all things,
Yet it returns to the Great Harmony.

**Chapter 66, 85 words.**
The Jiang and Hai [Seas] are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys
Because they excel in yielding.
Thus, they are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys.
Therefore, the Sage desires to be above the people,
But he must first speak of yielding.
He desires to lead the people,
But he must first place himself behind them.
Thus, though the Sage stands above them,
The people do not feel heavy,
And though he leads them,
The people are not harmed.
Therefore, all under Heaven willingly follow,
And do not grow weary.
It is not because he does not contend,
That all under Heaven cannot contend with him.

**Chapter 67, 150 words.**
All under Heaven say of me:
“I am great, yet seem unlike the great.”
For only because I am great,
Do I seem unlike the great.
If I were like the great,
Long ago I would have been small.
I have three treasures,
Which I hold and protect:
The first is called compassion,
The second is called frugality,
The third is called not daring to be first under Heaven.
Compassion, thus one can be courageous;
Frugality, thus one can be abundant;
Not daring to be first under Heaven,
Thus one can become the leader and the vessel.
Now, abandoning compassion and yet seeking courage,
Abandoning frugality and yet seeking abundance,
Abandoning the last and yet seeking to be first—
This is called the gate of death.
Compassion, when displayed, is upright;
When preserved, it is strong.
When Heaven is about to save someone,
It shields them with compassion.

**Chapter 68, 47 words.**
The ancients who excelled in being a scholar were not martial,
Those who excelled in war were not skilled in defeating enemies,
Those who excelled in using people placed themselves beneath them.
This is called the virtue of not contending,
This is called the power of using people,
This is called aligning with Heaven—
The ancient ultimate.

**Chapter 69, 57 words.**
In the use of arms, there is a saying:
“I do not dare to be the aggressor,
But rather the defender.
I do not dare to advance an inch,
But rather retreat a foot.”
This is called advancing without advancing,
Warding off without arms,
Seizing without weapons,
And thus having no enemies.
Disaster is not greater than having no enemies,
For having no enemies means nearly losing one’s treasure.
Thus, when armies are equal in strength,
The one who mourns will win.

**Chapter 70, 51 words.**
My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to put into practice.
Yet people cannot know them,
Cannot put them into practice.
Words have a root,
Affairs have a master.
Only because they lack knowledge,
They do not know me.
Few know me,
Thus I am precious.
Therefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade in his heart.

**Chapter 71, 32 words.**
To know that one does not know is best,
To not know that one knows is a disease.
Only because of this disease,
One does not fall into it.
The Sage’s freedom from disease
Is because he recognizes the disease,
Thus he is not diseased by others.

**Chapter 72, 48 words.**
If the people do not fear authority,
Then great authority will come.
Do not be familiar with what you dwell upon,
Do not weary of what you produce.
Only because of not wearying,
One does not weary.
Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,
Loves himself without prizing himself,
And so he abandons that and takes this.

**Chapter 73, 64 words.**
To be brave in daring is to kill,
To be brave in not daring is to live.
These two kinds—
Sometimes advantageous, sometimes harmful.
What Heaven detests, who knows its reason?
Thus, the Sage finds difficulty in difficulty.
The Way of Heaven
Is to conquer without contending,
To respond without speaking,
To be summoned without going,
And to plan silently.
The Heavenly net is vast and wide,
Though sparse, it does not lose its prey.

**Chapter 74, 61 words.**
The people do not commonly fear death.
How can one use death to frighten them?
If one makes the people fear death,
And treats it as something extraordinary,
Then I can seize and kill them—
Who would dare?
There are always those who execute killings,
Yet if one substitutes and executes killings,
This is to substitute the great carpenter.
He who substitutes the great carpenter
Rarely avoids injuring his own hands.

**Chapter 75, 63 words.**
The people’s hunger
Comes from their rulers taking too much in taxes.
Thus, they hunger.
The people are hard to govern
Because their rulers act with intent.
Thus, they are hard to govern.

**Chapter 76, 59 words.**
Those who treat death lightly
Do so because their rulers seek excessive life for themselves—
Thus, they treat death lightly.
Only those who do not prize life above all
Are wiser than those who do.

**Chapter 77, 87 words.**
When people are born, they are soft and weak;
When they die, they become stiff and strong.
Grass and trees, when alive, are tender and fragile;
When they die, they wither and decay.
Thus, the stiff and strong are the companions of death,
While the soft and weak are the companions of life.
Therefore, the strong in arms do not conquer,
And the strong in wood will snap.
Hence, the stiff and strong are placed below,
While the soft and weak are placed above.

**Chapter 78, 41 words.**
The Way of Heaven is like that of one drawing a bow.
It depresses what is high,
Elevates what is low,
Reduces what is excessive,
And supplements what is deficient.
The Way of Heaven reduces the excessive
And supplements the deficient.
But the Way of humanity does the opposite—
It takes from the deficient to feed the excessive.
Who among all can take from the excessive
And give to the deficient throughout the world
If not the one who follows the Dao?
Thus, the sage acts without claiming credit,
Completes the task without taking residence in it—
He does not wish to be seen as virtuous.

**Chapter 79, 73 words.**
Nothing under Heaven is softer or weaker than water,
Yet in attacking the stiff and strong, nothing surpasses it—
For there is nothing to replace it.
The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong—
All know this, yet none can practice it.
Therefore, the sage’s words say:
*"To bear the filth of the state
Is to be called the master of the ancestral altars.
To bear the misfortunes of the state
Is to be called the master of the world."*
Upright speech seems contrary.
*(End of Chapter 78.)*

*«To reconcile great grudges, there will surely remain some grudge—
How can this be called good?
Thus, the sage holds only the left half of the contract,
And does not demand recompense from others.

Therefore, one with **virtue** oversees the contract,
While one without **virtue** oversees its fulfillment.
The **Dao** of Heaven has no favorites,
Yet it constantly aligns with those of good nature.

**Chapter 80, 85 words.**
Small states, few people—
Let the people have tenfold or hundredfold implements yet not use them.
Let the people prize death above relocation.
Though there are boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them.
Though there are armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for use.

At the utmost height of governance,
The people find their food sweet,
Their clothing fine,
Their customs content,
Their occupations joyful.
Neighboring states are visible to one another,
The sounds of chickens and dogs are heard between them,
Yet the people do not travel to one another’s lands until they die of old age.

**Chapter 81, 57 words.**
Faithful words are not beautiful,
Beautiful words are not faithful.
Good words are not persuasive,
Persuasive words are not good.
The wise are not learned in many things,
Those learned in many things are not wise.
The sage accumulates nothing.
Having given to others, he is all the more possessed.
Having given to others, he is all the more abundant.
The **Dao** of Heaven benefits without harming.
The **Dao** of the sage acts without striving.
