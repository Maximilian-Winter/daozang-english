*The Supreme Scripture of the Sun and Moon in Primal Chaos*

Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—hard and soft unite in harmony. These four encompass one another, called the "key of endowment." The numbers two, four, three, five, and one are the essence of Heaven and Earth. The number of two eights corresponds to the celestial tally, converging within the crucible. The crucible is Heaven and Earth, the chamber of the gods. Qian and Kun form the Hall of Light; the medicinal substances are the sun and moon, husband and wife—thus, lord and minister.

The seasons of yin and yang, their fire following the movement of the lines, gradually align with the four seasons, uniting with yin and yang. The Five Phases overcome one another, alternating as father and mother. Spring and autumn divide, punishment and virtue converge. Thus, when Yellow Bell establishes *zi*, yang ascends leftward to *si*. When Linzhong establishes *wu*, yin descends rightward to *hai*. From one to nine, the numbers complete their cycle, then begin anew.

Once the blazing fire is kindled, the infant’s cries arise in sorrow. Ascending and descending, surging and bursting, it repeatedly strives to take flight. With utmost vigilance and caution, ever watchful, one must not falter in care—strict in movement and stillness.

If the lord is arrogant and the minister flattering, rewards and punishments miss their mark, the jade armillary loses its measure, cold and heat arrive untimely—disasters arise of themselves. If the lord is sagely and the minister upright, Heaven and Earth are clear and tranquil, sun and moon shine brilliantly, the Dao flourishes in splendor, royal transformation brings great peace, cold and heat follow the pitch-pipes, the pivot of the Dipper responds to the seasons. The Five Phases and Eight Trigrams—all affairs are well-ordered. Once weights and measures are balanced, yin and yang harmonize, the seasonal nodes are regulated—no moment is lost.

The mysterious radiance of the five colors transforms endlessly, drifting faintly, its form surpassing gleaming snow. It congeals like frost, gathers like fish scales in layered patterns, crystallizes like stalactites in blossoming splendor, rugged and intricate as bronze pillars. When yin and yang achieve union, they dwell in tranquil harmony. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger; shadows follow form, echoes answer sound. Water’s nature is to moisten and descend, fire’s qi is to blaze upward—Heaven and Earth, Kan and Li, are the natural state.

When the hun-spirit is settled and the po-soul congealed, qi pierces like autumn frost. Dim and undifferentiated, north and south are indistinguishable. Expelling yin and establishing yang, from one to nine—first white, then yellow, red and black as outer and inner, the colors shift to purple. Radiant and resplendent, after nine revolutions it becomes pure yang. The five directions are perfected in black, returning to the fertile earth to form the Reverted Elixir.

The flowing form of metal and stone, refined by fire for a year—when the steadfast adept ingests it, the ninefold return of golden cinnabar occurs. In an instant, transformation arises, swift as wind, dispersing like mist. The hundred bones and nine orifices, the four limbs and five viscera—searching out yin’s darkness, one establishes true yang. Like ice melting to return to the Great Obscurity, how could one know and yet remain deluded?

If one’s nature is imbued with latent potential, one naturally accords with the true principle. With resolute integrity, one may awaken to understanding. If one’s nature is dull and intent clumsy, harboring doubt and disbelief—such deep accumulation of misfortune will, in the end, leave one deaf to the truth. The luminous principle cannot be deceived. Let the scholar awaken to this—here I record my aspiration.

*Thus concludes The Supreme Scripture of the Sun and Moon in Primal Chaos.*
